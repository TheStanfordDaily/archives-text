# A 						Piano Out of Tune Spoils Relief Committee Harmony

It nil begins with ;i piano the latest blues singing con-J
corning the Women's Gym. Whv should a standard up-'
right piano in that uditice he worth a rental price of live!
dollars? Yet that is what the Stanford Student Belief Fund;
Committee discovered to he the price. Consequently, the'
most recent Student Belief dance was given in the Basket-}
hall Pavilion with two grand pianos donated to the or-,
chestra by Musical Hage.
The "Women's Gym Blues" has its other choruses, how-1
ever, choruses too numerous to mention in one short edi-i
torial column. The Student Relief Committee, on the face'
of its worthy purpose and its earnest administration, has,
.received splendid co-operation from all other quarters.!
The Hoard of Athletic Control donated the entire Stanford
Stadium, and, on Tuesday night, the Pavilion. The Stand
ard Oil Company donated amplifying equipment valued
in excess of liflv dollars. The manager of the Stanford
Theatre donated decorating materials.
And here's the rub the Women's Gym charged fif-'
teen dollars for rental of the building, and live dollars for
the piano. Beyond that pecuniary inconsideration, the
Women's Gym authorities failed to show the Relief Fund!
Committee due courtesy and failed to provide the prompt!
service for which the committee had paid. First of all, the |
committee was requested to comply with the gym's policy!
of advance payment. Then, arriving late in the afternoon
(o decorate the Dance Studio for their evening entertain
ment, the cot.-initlce members were forced to wait until
dinner time and after to gain entrance to the sacred studio,
while a class of two women students completed their esthe
lic gyrations within
After the hall was over, the Student Belief Committee
wailed around the women's Gvin portals for approxi
mately an hour for the janitors, to whom the rental fees;
meant wages, It) put in an appearance. It developed that
the janitors had not been notified that they were supposed
to lock the building.
The Women's Gym has failed to exhibit the co-opera
tion which it, as a Stanford institution, owes the Student
Belie I Fund. Beyond that, it has failed to give the Fund's i
administrators the courlesv and services Ihev were obliged
*• ». « ' j
to pay tor.
It is unlikely that the generous 8.A.C., which built the
local temple to women's physical education, intended it to
be operated in such a tight-listed manner. The situation
has its irony. The B.A.C. builds the Women's Gvm as a
physical education unit and a campus social center. Conies
the Depression, and the Student Belief Committee. The I
Women's Gvm (ails to come across for a worthy cause,!
and the B.A.C. limls itself loaning its own facilities.
The Fx Committee has taken up the sword for the I
maltreated Student Belief Committee with the appoint-1
ment of a committee to confer with Dr. Swain on matters;
iclative to the Fund, the Women's Gym, etc., etc. Perhaps
an administrative gathering of heads will arrive at the;
obvious truth that a Women's Gym piano is no more sacred
than any other piano.
