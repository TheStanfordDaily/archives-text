# Palo Alto's Comedy Of Errorsâ€”"Smith" Saga Continued
## 
### 
I'odav we fill < I our Mr. Smith again ill I lie hair of the
local law and or<icr. Vou remember Smith the gentlonian
who lound it possible even desirable to hit la m.p.b.
on blocks with only two or tlu'cc houses. This time our
hero's scene ol operations is a more populous section of
the city.
It appears that Smith was down town Ihc other day,
ostensibly to purchase groceries for his family. .Finding
parking spaces, as usual, an extreme rarity, he left his car
in one ol those sections edged in a beautiful shade of yel
low and labeled "Loading /one." He disappeared into a
store and returned some lime later loaded down with a
week s supply ol food. Awaiting him in sclf-righlous in
dignation was, of course, a policeman.
Smith again demanded to be shown before the dis
penser ol justice and was taken there. The police judge
heard the tacts ol the case and intimated that this time he
had Smith on the spot. I!e exhibited for the edification of
our. hero an ordinance prohibiting the use of such zones
tor any other purposes than loading or unloading.
"I was under the impression that 1 was loading my car,'"
was Smith's suggestion. The judge wished to know if the
Smith car was a commercial vehicle. Smith admitted that
it was not but claimed he failed to notice any mention oi*
"commercial vehicles" in the ordinance.
Again Judge Springer thumbed the city law book this
lime from cover to cover. He was at length forced to ad
mit that the phrase was sadly lacking from the law. Again
our Mr. Smith triumphed, and left for home with his bank
balance intact.
Today the moral is: "Know your city ordinances and,
with the strong backing of the written law, park and buy
in Palo Alto."
