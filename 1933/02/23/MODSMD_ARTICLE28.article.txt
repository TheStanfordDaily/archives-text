# BULL SESSION
## IN HONOR OF NOTHING 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
Yesterday, as is well known, was
| a holiday in honor of George Wash-
I ington—the man who made the
country safe for Democrats. It was
j also a very sunny day and so the
j golf course was crowded-with Stan
' ford people while the Campus was
! crowded with pop-eyed outlanders.
It was a typical holiday with edi
torials in the daily prints about thu
i Father of our Country and every
; body enjoying a relapse from that
! noble occupation—work.
I have nothing against George
Washington. In fact lu; is to be com
mended for proving that presidents
can be gentlemen. I have nothing
against holidays. In fact, they are to
be commended as splendid oppor
tunities for doing nothing but
catching up on the week's work. But
i I fail to see why every holiday must
I have somebody or something to
i honor.
|
Is work so noble that every rest
' must be disguised as tribute to
| something great and holy? The capi
j talists of a far-away age discovered
i that labor worked better if about
j every seventh day it stopped work
| ing. The dumb worker labored all
i week so that he could rest on the
: seventh day. So we have the Lord's
j Day of Rest. The theory is that we
! rest because He did. We do not rest
: because we need a rest. That is so
i honest and obvious—so straight
! forward, it can't be used.

And every holiday is belabored
with some object of adoration.
Fourth of July, Lincoln's Birthday,
Labor Day, New Year's, Christmas,
Thanksgiving, and the rest. I .suggest
a holiday to commemorate nothing—
to honor no one. It will just be a
holiday. When public speakers and
editorial writers ask, "Why?" we
will simply eye them coldly and in
a dispassionate manner bellow forth,
"No reason!"
On this day no stodgy relatives
will whimper, "Here we are playing
bridge in comfort and Washington
froze at Valley Forge." On this holi
day no one will ever be able to
"remind me of the great significance
of the date." In fact, it will probably
be a different date each year—to
prevent any traditional method of
celebration's being developed.*
There will be no "ringing in of the
new year"—no "thanking, for bene
fits"—no "great moral lessons to be
learned"—in short, there will be
nothing. It will be a holiday for
holiday's .sake. Nothing else. Ol'
course, we will do the same things
as we always do on regular holidays.
There will be only one difference. 1
Man will be able to feel that on this
one holiday he can be master of hi.s
own destiny. He can create for him
self a holiday—out of nothing—
without waiting for a great man to
die or a great event to happen.
