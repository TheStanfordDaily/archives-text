; CAVLCADE (Fox)—At the S(.
Francis Theatre, San Francisco.
Noel Coward's pugeant of war,
patriotism, and the chaos of the
twentieth century is because of its
many scenes, transitions in time,
and spectacular action tin extremely
difficult play to stage, and likely to
become too obviously theatrical. But
| for these very reasons it is excellent
| movie material, and Director Frank
Lloyd has made the most of it.
Were the word not too much
abused, one might call the picture
epic in scope. Coward's main theme
is the breakdown of Victorian se
curity into the incertitude of mod
ern life, and the efforts of these
j changes on two British families. The
play opens with the Boer war, and
| then are introduced the death of
I Victoria, the sinking of the "Ti
, tanic," and the World War as the
! central points about which the ac
tion is built. In spite of the bands,
the pomp, and the fanfare which are
an integral part of the play, the tone
| is definitely minor, with patriotism
! and hope for the future as sustain
| ing forces.
The excellent adaptation has kept
almost every good point of Coward's
play, and improved considerably
upon it by the omission of some bad
scenes and the insertion of two new
j ones. Especially interesting was the
i juxtaposition of Coward's last two
| scenes, slightly changing the tone of
| the play. Coward brings in the
! theme of patriotism and hope first,
j and then overshadows it with the
j despairing "Twentieth Century
| Blues." The movie version inter
, changes these, leaving the idea of
hope dominant. In one respect, the
! emphasis of the picture was prob
! ably misplaced: Coward chose not
— —t

I to emphasize the physical horrors
of war, but only to show the effects
of war upon the life of the nation;
consequently the long double-oho
tography scenes of distorted faces
: and mangled corpses, while they fit
in well enough, weaken rather than
strengthen the main theme.
The acting and direction are both
remarkably uniform and excellent.
Both showed a degree of restraint
that, while absolutely necessary to
the picture, one does not usually ex
pect in an American production,
especially in one with as much, fan
' fare as this has. No one actor stood
I but honors go to Clive Brook
and Diana Wynward for their work
in the leading roles. The fact that
I the action takes place over a thirty
' year period added to their difficul
ties.
The few bad spots were a result
of the play, not of the production.
For, in spite of its unity of theme,
i Coward's play is too episodic, and in
danger of breaking into several
pieces. Also, although he intended
to bring the degeneration and death
of Bridges into the main theme, he
: did not succeed well. But these de
fects pass unnoticed in the succes
sion of excellent scenes. The hyster
ical scene in the theatre after the
relief of Mafeking, and the scene on
th "Titanic"—one of the best Cow
ard has ever written—are the most
outstanding bits. — Zimansky
