# Wild Cream Puff Disrupts Peace of Sequoia Hallmen
## 
### 
From Iho wilds of Sequoia
Nail comes the tale of two men
and a cream puff.
11 seems a bunch of the boys
wore whooping it up—dinner
was being served. In the midst
of the munching, Hasher Al
Rush ton inquired: "Anyone
bore want another cream puff?"
Across the room Student Dante
Kern be trilled: "Yes, sir, I do."
"Oke" said Rushton, and let 'er
fly.
With a slurp the puff settled
into the outstretched hand of
Lemhi. A gentle titter ran
around the room as Hasher
Rushton retired to the safety
of the kitchen and Student
Lemhi to the sanctum of his
study—with a pair of puffs for
later use.
