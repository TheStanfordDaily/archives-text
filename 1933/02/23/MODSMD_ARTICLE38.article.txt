WHEN A PI PHI answered the
phone the other night she thought
it was rather peculiar that a gentle
man from the Daily business staff
should be anxious to "solicit Pi Phi
advertising" . . . When told to go out
on the front lawn and see for her
self how good things were, she hung
up, woke up the girl friends, House
Mama, etc., broke lock-out rules
(about 11 p.m.) . . .
THE PI PHI'S have seen lots of
colored lanterns, but now they're
asking the question: "Since when
do the A.T.O.'s find time to run
across the street to illuminate the
lawns of their next-door neigh
bors?" . . .
AND OSCAR WRITES in to in
quire as to what three Theta's guz
zled up most of a certain graduate's
beer the other night in Paly without
asking his permission? And when
he walked in and caught the trio
red-handed . . . they had the nerve
to ask him to go downtown and buy
a loaf of rye bread and some cheese
. . . Well, Oscar, old bean, phone
6195 and find out for yourself . . .
That's what WE did . . . .
Minnesota and Ohio State are the
only teams in the Big Ten who do
not have at least one native of Indi
ana on their basketball team.
