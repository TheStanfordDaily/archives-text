## Condescending To Discuss a Californian 
### 
It is only with much mental pain
and tremendous internal suffering
that I have come to realize that the
hoary and honorable Stanford
"Down With California" tradition
has disappeared and that Stanford
is therefore doomed to an existence 1
as a mere university.
There was a time (before the
Stanford Axe became the Stan
ford Axiom) that the very
phrase ''Down With California"
would cause loud tbunipings in
(lie breasts of hearty Stanford
men and would bring a l'aint,
salmon-adored Hush to (he
checks of Indian maidens. But
them days have gone forever,
and now ail that remains is a
queer offshoot of (bis spirit that 4
annually assumes the form of
"llale S.C." when the lime for
the yearly football beating
comes around.
This collegiate lethargy is due, of i
course, to the modern idea of inter- {
nationalism that forces us all 1o be !
tolerant and to love our neighbors
as ourselves. The weakening of the
tradition might also be caused by
adolescent pseudo-sophistication, but
that is irrelevant and would muti
late my point,
VALUABLE SPACE IS
DEVOTED TO CALIFORNIA
Therefore, since I am at heart a j
conformist and would dislike greatly
to do anything that might be con
sidered disloyal or brand me as a
traitor, I gladly devote this column '
today to the captain of the Cali
fornia basketball team.
Jack Head is the California
captain, and this story comes to
me through Slanfordite Bob
Mynard. Head, at present one of
the best ccntcrs on the Pacific
Coast, was once a gangling,
awkward kid who literally
couldn't liil the broad side of a
barn wall with a basketball.
But that was before he began
throwing basketballs at the Myn
ard's barn. It seems that both Bob
and Jack lived in Oakland, and that
Bob's family had constructed a bas
ketball court out of an old wagon
wheel, some hard-packed earth, and j
the side of a barn.
READ BETTER BASKETBALL
PLAYER THAN TALKER
The Reads had no basketball court j
because someone might break a
window or trample on the garden.
So young Jack, aged nine, went over
to the Mynards and spent his days i
practicing until he. could hit the
basket as well as the barn.
Never very talkative, Read
would prefer an afternoon with
himself shooting baskets to a
conversation or a card game.
Read's most marked ability,
aside from playing basketball,
is the drawing of cartoons, and
Jack used to amuse the other
kids at (he Clareniont Grammar
School with his portraits of
teachers.
Saturday night, Read wiH face
Stanford for ihe last time, and he
hopes to end his romantic life-story
with a typical Horatio Alger, Jr.,
conclusion. But it so happens that
three Stanford seniors (Captain Tom
Cordry, John Hancock, and Jay Tod)
would also like te terminate their
basketballing with a victory before
beginning to look for jobs. And
since these three (not to mention
Topping, Edelen, Schnetka, and
Weaver) refuse to act like Stanford
gentlemen and donate the victory
to California, there may be much
playing over at Berkeley Saturday.
