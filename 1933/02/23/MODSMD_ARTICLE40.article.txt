# Johnston-Mallory Clash Features Bouts Tonight
## STANFORD BOXERS TANGLE WITH U.C. MEN AT BERKELEY 
### Albert Guerard 
Fighting the most "experienced
heavyweight in amateur boxing,
Phil Johnston, 220-pound University
champion, meets Milo Mallory, na
tional champion in 1927, in the fea
ture bout of the Stanford-California
matches at 8 o'clock tonight in the
California Gymnasium.
Lieutenant Jack Kennedy, who
awarded Young Corbett 111 the wel
terweight championship of the
world yesterday, will be the third
man in the ring.
Can He Come Back?
Interest in tonight's bouts will
center on the comeback attempt of
California's ex-champion, now a
fine tackle on Bill Ingram's football
team, who will be fighting his sec
ond match in five years. In 1931
Mallory defeated Stanford's "Bull"
Driscoll by a technical knockout in
the third round, but showed little of
the punch that brought him numer
ous kayo victories in 1927 and 1928,
Depending on better condition and
exceptional speed, Johnston has an
excellent chance of upsetting Cali
fornia's rusty champion. One bout
in five years is not quite enough.
There are eleven fights on to
night's program: 113 pounds: Yuji
Imai (S) vs. Ernest Boucher (C);
125 pounds: Jim Feely (S) vs. Cap
tain John Jan (C); 135 pounds:
Captain Fred Glover (S) vs. Angelo
Mazzeta (C), Stewart Stephens (S)
vs. Stanley Goulard (C); 145 pounds:
Bob Quinn (S) vs. George Thurston
(C), Newt Ridley (S) vs. James
Hogle (C); 155 pounds: Waldo Mun
day (S) vs. Don Smith (C), Oscar
Baer (S) vs. Marshall Elvin (C);
165 pounds: John Fowler (S) vs.
Joseph De√üisi (C); 175 pounds:
Morris Oppenheim (S) vs. Mario
Pozzo (S); heavyweight: Phil
Johnston (S) vs. Milo Mallory (C).
Jim Fecly-John Jan
Second only in interest to the
Mallory-Johnston fight is the 125-
pound clash between John Jan, Cali
fornia captain, and Jim Feely, the
Stanford featherweight whose crush
ing fists sent Ronald Painter, the
intercollegiate featherweight cha m -
pion, to the hospital with two broken
ribs and a punctured lung following
the Stanford-Cal Aggies matches
several tfeeks ago.
Stanford's brightest hopes are
centered on Captain Fred Glover,
classy lightweight, who should be
able to defeat Angelo Mazetta of
California. George Thurston and
Mario Pozzo of California scored
knockouts over Aggie boxers last,
week, and are slight favorites over
Bob Quinn and Morris Oppenhcim
of Stanford. The Indian junior mid
dleweights, Waldo Munday and Os
car Baer, have a slight edge over
| Don Smith and Marshall Elvin, the
Bear 155-pounders.
Five Doubtful Bouts
Stanford and California both de
feated the Aggies' by a 6-5 margin,
but against California the Davis
boxers were handicapped by the
necessity of forfeiting three bouts.
Indian hopes of revenging last
year's 4-.'] defeat at the hands of the
Bears will rest tonight on the out
come of the very doubtful Imai-
Boucher, Stephens-Goulard, Ridley-
Hogle, Do Risi-Fowler, and Mallory-
Johnston battles.

It has been estimated that two
thirds of the students enrolled in the
University of Paris are Americans.
