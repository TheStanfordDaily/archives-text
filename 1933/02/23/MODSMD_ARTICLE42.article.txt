# Frosh Nine Vs. Sequoia Today
## 
### 
Having suffered a 7 to 5 loss at
the hands of Mission High last
Tuesday, Stanford's frosh baseball
team will attempt to redeem itself
this afternoon when it battles a nine
from Sequoia High School on the
local diamond. The contest, which
will commence promptly at 3:30
o'clock, marks the second time this
season that the Babes have met the
Sequoia boys, Stanford having won
the first engagement 4 to 3.
Eight errors contributed greatly
to the yearlings' defeat Tuesday.
The infield did no.t function in its
usual fashion, while the outfield also
took a decided turn for'the worse.
Franchesci hurled the entire nine ,
innings and allowed the visitors ;
eleven hits, while Stanford was able J
to garner but six.
A screaming two-bagger in the
ninth inning by Clark, shortstop,
was the only extra base blow gar
nered by the yearlings, and it aided
materially in a three-run rally
staged at this point of the contest.

In this afternoon's game Coach
Cuddeback will probably start
Blanchard, a right-hander, on the
mound, with either Allen or Mor
gan receiving his offerings. Grayson,
on first, Galbraith at second, Clark
at short, and Tremaine on third
make up the opening infield. Cudde
back is undecided about his out
field, but Hamilton, Moscrip, Pope,
Mackroth, and Marshall should all
see service.
