# VARSITY DEFEATS FROSH FIVE 31-20 IN ANNUAL BATTLE
## 
### 
A good big man can always beat
a good little man.
This ancient sporting adage came
true in full measure Tuesday after
noon when Stanford's Varsity bas
ketball team defeated Rabbit Brad
shaw's freshmen, 31-20, in the an
nual game between the two teams.
Just five baskets and a free throw
separated the two quintets at the
finish, and this was a pretty fair
indication of the relative ability of
the yearling players and their more
experienced brethren.
Varsity Starts Fast
First-minute baskets by Jay Tod
and Payne Palmer indicated a pos
sible varsity landslide, but Addie
Barnett retaliated with a brilliant
down-court dribble 'and close-in
.shot. Hal Edelen's three set-up shots
played a big part in giving the var
sity a 16-G halftime lead.
Edelen, Viguie Star
With all apologies to massive
guards Jay Tod and John Hancock
and a whole flock of good freshman
players, the stars of Tuesday's con
test were Hal Edelen, varsity, and
George Viguie, freshman. Unques
tionably Edelen is now a better
player than Viguie, but the latter is
very nearly ripe for a first-string
varsity position.
Without the services of Keith
Topping and Captain Tom Cordry,
both injured, only the size and en
durance of the varsity players gave
them an edge over Rabbit Brad
shaw's smooth-playing freshmen.

a good little man.
