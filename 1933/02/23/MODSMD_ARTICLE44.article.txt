# Rugby Squad To Play Reds In Relief Tilt
## 
### 
Having bowled over all opposition
to date with little difficulty, the
Stanford Rugby Club has gone afield i
to seek added laurels. Friday after
noon at 4:15 o'clock, they bring the
campus probably the best rugby
| competition Northern California will
see in the current season, when they
clash with the Pasadena Reds. Ad
mission is 25 cents, and all profits
j go to the student relief fund.
Members of Friday afternoon
4 and 5 o'clock gym classes, who j
wish to attend the game, will
be permitted to do so upon ap
plication to their sports instruc
tors.
Pasadena, undefeated, and the |
piide of the Southern California
Rugby union, arrives here with
eighteen men Thursday night, plays
the Stanford game Friday, and meets
the Olympic Club in San Francisco
the following day.
Stanford's goal line has yet to be
; crossed. San Jose accounted for the
| only score against them by means 1
of a place kick on a pepalty.
An official line-up for the Cardi
nals is yet to be selected, but among
those present will probably be
Johnny Reisner, Ernie Caddell,
Norm Cleaveland, Buck Van Dellen,
Tex Walker, Bus Holmes, and Ben
Palamountain. In addition, Bobby
Grayson, of the baffling himÂ«-motion,
i may be able to get in uniform. Of
! the backs, Reisner has recently
! scintillated with consistency.
The dirigible Macon will carry
five airplanes within its hull. J
