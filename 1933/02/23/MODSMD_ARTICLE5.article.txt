MANILA, P.1., Feb. 22 (/Pi-
Naval and army officers here
were holding the Asiatic Fleet
in readiness today for possible
orders which would send them
to China to protect American
life and property.
PEIPING, Feb. 22 t/P)â€”The Chi
nese commander at. Chao-yang, Je
hol, reported tonight that Japanese
infantry had attacked the town of
Nanling, a few miles west of there,
after a bomb attack from the air.
Three hundred Japanese were
killed, the message from General
Tung Fu-Ling said, and the Chinese
losses were almost as heavy.
The General said 4000 infantry
participated in the attack, driving
with fixed bayonets after their
planes had bombed the town.
Jchol Attack Seen
Foreign military observers here
regarded the engagement as pre
liminary to a general attack in Je
hol. The weather in that country
is bitter cold, the roads coated with
ice, and all fronts under deep snow.
General Suzuki's Japanese army,
headed for Jehol city, 200 miles
from here, has captured its first im
portant objective, the rail head at
Peipiao in Jehol's coal mining cen
ter.
Railroad Tunnel Destroyed
When they marched in yesterday
they found the city deserted. The
Chinese inhabitants, forewarned of
the advance, had partially destroyed
the railroad tunnel from Nanling, a
few miles to the east, and had at
tempted to blow up a bridge to
check the Japanese march.
Japanese planes flew across the
Tungliao area bombing Chinese ir
regulars to clear the way for troops
which will advance into Jehoi from
the north.
