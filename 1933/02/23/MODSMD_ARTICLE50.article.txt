### 
HAVANA, Feb. 22 (A 3 )â€” At least
i half a dozen outbreaks in widely
j separated parts of the island were
reported today, heralding the long
| predicted revolt against the Macha
j do rule.
j In distant Oriente province, cra-
J die of all Cuban revolutions, at least
one serious clash occurred yester
day.
Arms, Ammunition Taken
At Santa Clara, in the middle of
| the island, rebels were reported to
j have attacked the government's mil
itary station, carrying away arms
and ammunition.
At the other end of the island, not
far west of here, a band of men
tried to seize arms and money at a
grocery store in the town of Al
quizar.
Two Soldiers Slain
Meager reports said two soldiers
were slain in a battle at San An
tonio, a town near the United States
naval coaling station at Guanta
namo. A group led by Ex-Senator
Gonzalo Perez Andrez, former sup
porter of President Machado, en
gaged army forces in battle.
Other small bands were reported
| active in that section of Oriente
i province. Government officials dis
! closed early this month that they
| learned Cuban exiles planned to
land in Oriente to start the revolu
tion.
Exiles Join Rebels
The exiles, including many who
participated in the unsuccessful re
volt; against President Machado in
August , 1931, were expected to reach
Cuba from Mexico or Honduras.
Groups of armed men were said
to' be starting fires in the sugar cane
fields. A storekeeper and two ban
dits were reported slain.
President Machado ordered all
police, prison guards, and rural
guards enrolled in the army.
