# Roosevelt's Choices For Cabinet Lauded
## Cordell Hull Qualified For Secretary Of State, Says Stuart 
### 
Professor Graham H. Stuart, of
the Political Science Department,
commenting on the tentative selec
tions for the "new deal" cabinet, said
yesterday:
"In selecting Cordell Hull for
Secretary of State, Roosevelt may
be criticized for passing over more
experienced Democrats such as
Baker, Young, and John and Nor
man Davis. Nevertheless," Stuart
pointed out, "Hull is a financial ex
pert fully qualified to handle di dif
ficult international problems.
"William H. Woodin, as president
of the American Car & Foundry
Company and New York Federal
Reserve Bank director, in the posi
tion of Secretary of the Treasury,
should quiet the fears of big busi
ness «as 1o an immediate policy of
currency inflation.
"The greatest surprise is the
choosing of Miss Frances Perkins as
the Secretary of Labor—not because
.she is not fitted for the post, but
because a trained sociologist would
hardly be the choice of the labor
unions.
In regard to the appointment of
Senators Walsh and Swanson as At
torney General and Secretary of
Navy, respectively, Dr. Stuart de
clared it was significant that Roose
velt had been successful in secur
ing threp senators for cabinet posi
tions.
