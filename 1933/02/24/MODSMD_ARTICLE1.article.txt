# CARDS HOT FOR CAGE WIN OVER U.G. TOMORROW
## Captain Cordry, Topping Return; Boost Stock Of Stanford Five ENDS LOCAL SEASON Freshman Squads To Meet In Preliminary 
### 
Having attained a winning stride
too late to become a factor in the
Southern Division conference race,
already won by U.S.C., Stanford's
varsity basketball team travels to
Berkeley tomorrow night, deter
mined to save something from the
wreckage of what might have been
a very successful season.
Indian chances of winning the
third and final game of the annual
Indian-Boar series brightened con
siderably yesterday when Keith
Topping and Captain Tom Cordry
made.' their first appearance of the
week on the Pavilion floor.
1 lie season finale for both
teams will begin at 8 o'clock in
California Gymnasium. Stanford
and California freshman players
will conclude their series meet
in a preliminary game at 6:30
o'clock.
Linc-up
Coach John Bunn announced his
starting line-up late yesterday after
noon: Topping, center; Edolen and
Captain Cordry, forwards; Schnetka
and Hancock, guards. Against this
veteran combination, Nibs Price will
start an equally experienced five:
Read, center; Eifert and Coughlan,
forwards; Ohashi and Crowley,
guards.
Tomorrow's game is all Blue-and-
Gold, if only paper statistics are
considered. California has won four
straight games from Stanford, two
this season. In the first 1933 contest,
the Indians played brilliant ball dur
ing ihe first half, only to bog down
completely, and allow the Bears to
run out a 37-22 score. The second
game was marked by Stanford's
poor passing and California's excel
lent defensive play. The Bears won,
28-18. Each team has played ten
conference games: California has
won seven, Stanford has lost seven.
I'sych Plays Part
Good old Psychology, which has
won and lost more athletic contests
than mere athletic ability could
dream of, is all for Stanford. The
morale of the Indian five is way up
in the rafters of Ihe Los Angeles
Auditorium, still concerned with the
40-38 and 41-35 victories over
U.C.L.A. last Friday and Saturday.
The Bears, on the other hand, are
now in the depths of basketball in
difTerence. Beaten out of a further
chance to win the conference title
by a referee's mistake, the Bears are
finding it difficult to get fired up
with the conventional "Hate Stan
ford!" spirit.
Reports have emanated from
Berkeley practice sessions that
the Bears are not taking to
morrow's game very seriously.
Stanford, on the other hand, has
been working out with a viciousness
iMid determination that presages a
better basketball future, even though
thV "future," as far as the 1933 sea
son is concerned, has only thirty
six more hours to run.
