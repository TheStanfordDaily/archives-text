## James Sandoe Is Featured With Paul Crary And A. Grove Day 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
The second dramatic offering of
the quarter will be presented March
3, which is the date announced for
Harold Helvenston's production of
"An Enemy of the People."
The five-act Ibsen satiric com
edy will be presented by a
skilled cast headed by James
Sandoc, last seen in "Romeo and
Juliet." Sandoc has the role of
Thomas Stockinann, Medical Di
rector of the Municipal Baths,
and it is a splendid role. Stock
maim is the central figure of the
play, a man who searches after
truth, with the belief that the
majority is not always- right.
Brothers Contrast
Stockmann is contrasted with his
brother Peter, mayor of the dity and
head of the Baths, who is a bigoted,
self-centered man. A. Grove Day
has this part.
Throughout the piay there are op
portunities for excellent characteri
zations and interpretations of the fine
characters with which the Norwegian
dramatist has filled his play.
Feminine Roles
The female roles are played
by Mary Ann Crary, who in
terprets Mrs. Thomas Stock
mann, and Fritzi-Beth Bowman
as Petra, daughter of Dr. and
Mrs. Stockmann. The other
Stockmann children, the boys,
are played by Lloyd and Wald
ron Wilson, who have been seen
to advantage in previous campus
plays.
The prominent role of Hovstad,
editor of the town newspaper which
begins the controversy, is played by
Paul Crary, a newcomer. Other
novices are Robert Balzer in the
character role of old Morten Kiil,
and Robert Dwan as Aslaksen, the
printer. Dave Davis, of the "Bird in
Hand" cast, is cast as Horster, the
ship's captain who befriends Stock
mann and his family.
