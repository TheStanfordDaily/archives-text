# Guerard Talks On Seven Conceptions Of Genius
## 
### 
The only true geniuses, the origi
nators, are the unknown geniuses,
for recognition implies a certain ele
ment of commonplace, concluded
Professor Albert Guerard, of the
English department, yesterday, when
he spoke before the University
Philological Association in the Wo
men's Clubhouse.
Professor Guerard presented a
paper on the "Seven Conceptions of
Genius," a summarizing of a sym
posium with one of his classes.
Among the different conceptions
of the term, a collection of defini
tions most often put forth, was:
Eminence and Recognition: no man
is a genius until he has at least a
few followers to call him one.
Professor Guerard's paper was
read with the idea of stimulating
further discussion on the question
of a definition for a genius.
