A picture of the well-dressed
Stanford man, as seen by the "500."
On Quad he wears clean cords, a
fresh white shirt beneath a blue
slip-on sweater, and no necktie. The
blue of the sweater is not compul
sory, being preferred only slightly
to yellow, with green, grey, tan,
white, and brown next in order of
choice. Strangely enough, red is
most unpopular.
While most women believe that
grey flannels or tweeds are better
looking than cords, they concede
that one can hardly expect a man to
keep clean all the time. Few of them
really object to cords, but they all
agree that moleskins should be
banned. And if a man wears suit
pants with a sweater, or a suit coat
over cords, he is committing a
breach of etiquette.
Colored shirts come in for a heavy
ding, while no shirts at all are con
sidered perfectly hateful, "except
perhaps on Carl von Saltza."
Neckties on Quad are considered

unnecessary by most, really bad by j
others, while a few prim souls deem i
them the only thing.
Who nhe gets all spiffed up for a
Sunday afternoon in spring, a Stan
ford woman's man may not slip up
on a single detail. White flannels, a
dark blue coat and vest, white shirt, j
necktie and matching handkerchief,'
and black and white shoes was the 1
majority's choice. A brown coat and
white or grey flannels, or a blue coat j
and grey flannels, with appropriate I
shoes meets the approval of a few
others. But no hat—evei\
I If any Stanford man feels brave j
enough to wear the newly-intro- |
duced tropical mess-coat to a for- j
nuil, he would be wise first to ask
his date what she thinks of it, for
the opinion of the "500" varies
greatly. Although these coats aro < <
fairly popular, some claim they j
should be worn only in the South, !
