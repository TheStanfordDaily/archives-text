### ALBERT GUERARD 
DERKELEY, Feb. 211—C rumpling to the door after less than sixty seconds
of fighting. Phil Johnston, 220-pouiul Stanford heavyweight, lost by a
technical knockout to California's Milo Mallory, national amateur chain- I
pion in 1927, in the main event of the Bear-Indian boxing matches here
tonight which were won by California, 7-4.
Heavily-muscled Mallory, a tackle on the California football team,
appeared to be in much better condition than in 1931 when he defeated
"Bull" Driscoll of Stanford by a technical knockout in the third round.
A series of hard righls and lefts to the body battered Johnston to the
canvas before the light had barely started. The Indian boxer lay fiat on his ,
back for several seconds, and then attempted to get up. but Coach Harry
Maloney stepped into the ring, thus forfeiting the bout.
California's team victory, something of a surprise in view of the Bears'
poor showing against the Cal Aggies last week, was cemented by two

I decisions which were so close that
{ a large portion of the California
j Gymnasium crowd thought the
i fights should have gone an extra
| round.
In the first of these Stanley Gou
lard, Bear lightweight, was awarded
j a three-round verdict over Stewart
j Stephens. The two fighters stayed at
j long range throughout the fight,
wHh the Stanford boxer landing
! more telling blows. Awarding the
, bout to Goulard came as a complete
surprise to the large pro-California
| crowd.
James Hogle, a junior middle
! weight, shaded Newt. Ridley in the
I other toss-up fight. Hogle proved to
I be an exceptionally good defensive
j fighter, and hit cleanly, but the fight
| could have gone another round
j without hurting either boy.
Fcely Whips Jan
The three best fights of tin 1
evening ended in Stanford vic
tories. In the first of these Jim
Fcely, rapidly becoming the
most-feared featherweight on
the Pacific Coast, easily out
fought Captain John Jan of
California. Fcely, a beautiful
counter puncher, landed count
| less rights to the Bear boxer's
midsection and had him on the
verge of a knockout in the last
round.
Encountering unexpectedly tough
I opposition, Fred Glover, captain of
j the Indian squad, won a fairly close
| decision over Angelo Mazetta, Bear
j lightweight. The bout produced
j some fancy slugging and boxing,
j with Glover enjoying a slight edge
j in all three rounds.
In a slugging match that found
j both boxers completely exhausted
| and out on their feet at the finish,
: Oscar Baer shaded Marshall Elvin,
j California junior middleweight. Foi
! awhile it looked as though both
j boxers would topple over before the
J end of the final round.
Munday on Foul
Stanford's fourth victory was
registered by Waldo Munday,
who won on a foul over Don
Smith in the second round. The
Bear fighter repeatedly hit Mun
; day low in clinches. .
Joe Deßisi, California 165-poundt
j or, found John Fowler of Stanford
I a very tough opponent, and had
j some difficulty in getting under the
i Indian boxer's long arms. The Bear
i fighter was given the decision after
| three fairly close rounds.
Tlie other three bouts resulted in
Bear victories: George Thurston had
no trouble decisioning Bob Quinn
jin a 145-pound bout. Thurston
scored a knockdown early in the
first round. Ernest Boucher, Cali
! fornia bantamweight, nosed out Yuji
Imai, when the Stanford boxer tired
j badly in the third round. Morris
j Oppenheim, Stanford light-heavy
; weight fighting his first intercolle
| giate bout, lost a clean-cut decision
to Mario Pozzo of California. Oppen
heim put up an excellent fight, but
was outclassed.
