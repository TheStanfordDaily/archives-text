Looking to social stress as a
possible reason for the attempt
oil the lite of President-elect
Roosevelt, Bcach stated: "The
history of political assassination,
at least in recent times, would
indicate that the danger is
heightened in all times of spe
cial social disorder: consider the
assassinations of Lincoln, Gar
field, McKinley."
"Does American individualism or
even lawlessness make it unneces
sarily difficult to protect our political
leaders from more or less inevitable
danger?"
Access To Guns
The Beach answer: "It is too
easy for anyone to obtain a gun.
But there is a tremendous out
cry against the proposal that
everyone—native or alien—be
registered and so put on record.
There is vigorous unwillingness
to obey laws for the public
safety which the individual dis
likes.
"Yet in so complicated a social
life as ours today, a few such meas
ures of administrative control, .to
gether with a change in our extreme
individualism, would do much to
lessen the danger of political assassi
nation.
"The difficulty does not come
from an occasional ignorant or
weak minded alien; it comes
from ourselves!"
