# Nudism Still a Dream— Clothiers Continue Dress Dictatorship
## 
### 
Dress, scorned as a bothersome convention by some
very charming nudists that you read about but never meet,
is somewhat of a necessity even in such a windily free
community as the Stanford campus. From the well-ward
robed young lady, who perpetually "hasn't a thing to wear,"
to the roughest rough, who can never decide what to wear
where and effects a perpetual compromise of cords and
sweater sans shirt. Fashion, fickle, changing arbiter of
dress, affects the sartorial habits of the Farm's many, the
attitudes and tastes of the few.
Realizing that fashion in dress has such a grip upon the
whirl of Stanford's depression-dance society, Daily type
writer keys were dusted to turn out this morning's Fashion
Edition. Ink-stained fingers accustomed to banging out
the lead "Stanford's aqua pura poloists mopped up the
Encina Pool yesterday afternoon with the Blue and Gold
mermen" refine themselves this morning to playing "indi
viduality will dictate milady's attire at tea" upon the keys.
A tip from the source of campus news — the straightest
dope on fashion to be found anywhere in this issue is in
cluded in the advertisements. The Daily's advertisers have
attempted to segregate the news on Spring fashion which
will most interest student readers, and may we subtlely
suggest that our advertisers know whereof they speak con
cerning fashions, even if the rank and file of this paper's
editors do not.
