# Nudism Still a Dreamâ€” Clothiers Continue Dress Dictatorship
## 
### 
Dress, scorned as a bothersome convention l>v some
very charming nudists that you rend about but never meet,
is somewhat of a necessity even in such a windilv free
community as the Stanford campus. From the well-ward
robed young lady, who perpetually "hasn't a tiling to wear,"
to the roughest rough, who can never decide what to wear
where and effects a perpetual compromise of cords and
sweater sans shirt, Fashion, tickle, changing arbiter of
dress, affects the sartorial habits of the Farm's many, the
attitudes and tastes of the few.
Realizing that fashion in dress has such a <4rip upon the
whirl of Stanford's depression-dance society, Daily type
writer keys were dusted to turn out this morning's Fashion
Kdition. Ink-stained fingers accustomed to banging out
the lead "Stanford's aqua pura poloists mopped up the
I'.ncina Pool yesterday afternoon with the 1)1 Lie and Gold
mermen" refine themselves this morning to playing "indi
viduality will dictate milady's attire at tea" upon the keys.
A lip from the source of campus news the straightest
dope on fashion to be found anywhere in this issue is in
cluded in the advertisements. The Daily's advertisers have
attempted to segregate the news 011 Spring fashion which
will most interest student readers, and may we subtlelv
suggest that our advertisers know whereof they speak con
cerning fashions, even if the rank and file of this paper's
editors do not.
