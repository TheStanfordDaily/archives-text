# All the Way from North Carolina Comes a Distinctly Pleasant Surprise

Humming ils way second-class mail ali (Tic way lo \orlh
Carolina a while back, went a copy of I lie Daii.v. II came
back recently looking rather pleased and surprised, for il
liad won first-place honors for Pacific ('oast student news
papers in a nalion-wide survey of campus publications
conducted by llic Daili/ Tar Heel of tbe I'niversity of North
(Carolina.
This distinction conies as a pleasant shock. After all,
North Carolina is a long way off, and the examination of
competing papers, as given in a news story on another page,
was manifold and minute.
In passing, the Daii.v congratulates its rivals,
tlie l .C.L.A. Daily liruiii and the Oreyon Stair liaromcler,
casts a glance of affectionate regret in the direction of the
Daily ('.alifornian, and nazes wonderinglv off toward (Co
lumbia I'niversity, w hose Daily Spectator won national first
place.
full credit for the honor must" go to the editor of Volume
<SL\ which closed last Friday, for il was his effort which
brought the 7/vu.v thus up in the money. It sincerely
pleases the present staff that il can record this recognition
of the services tendered his post by ex-Editor Stewart
("Hack six-bits") Crawford.
