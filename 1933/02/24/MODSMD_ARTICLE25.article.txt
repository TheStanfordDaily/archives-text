# Palo Alto's Comedy Of Errorsâ€”An Elucidating Epilogue
## 
### 
The "Smith" saga is not over, "lis said that our hero
has many nrorc cop-baiting schemes up his ample sleeve.
Hut in any event he- has served his immediate purpose of
showing that even so tight a drag-net as the Palo Alto po
lice are stretching may be shot full of holes.
And in shooting i! full of holes Smith has proved that
the only wav to show up a small-time police drive is by
small-time methods. Small-time is the only phrase worthy
of a city, ordinarily slack in the matter of traflic enforce
ment. which launches into a much-publicised, viciously
enforced anti-speeding campaign.
The obvious glee with which we are informed that out
siders are to he shown not the slightest consideration is
typical of the small-timer's cockiness, typical, too, are the
arrests which have been made for a fraction of a mile in
excess of the limit, and the fact that the bead of the board
which is responsible for the campaign has been arrested
and not fined.
After all there is such thing a as inter-city reciprocation
in the matter of hospitality and good feeling. We wait with
avid anticipation the time when one of our local citizens
is arrested in Milpitas or some other nearby metropolis
where his city's reputation has proceeded him. The judge's
sarcastic, remarks should be a delight to the ear.
A well-balanced, constant campaign for the elimination
of speeding and accidents is certain to meet with the ap
proval of practically everyone. The urge to arrest should
be tempered by absolute impartiality, recognition of ex
tenuating circumstances, and some degree of decenev and
lieiienev shown outsiders.
If the present regime of viciousness, partiality, and pet
tiness is kept up we may expect lo hear more of our Mr.
Smith.
