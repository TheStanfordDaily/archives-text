### ABE MELLINKOFF 
BY ANY OTHER NAME . . .
A fluffy formal—a strong light,
and the result is well visible. Now,
; I have no objection to legs. They are
| very necessary and useful; but there
! is a time and a place for almost
everything. And a formal dance is
j neither the time nor the place to
| silhouette two legs against taffeta
: ruffles.
I There is no intention to raise the
| moral issue. Morally, I don't give a
j whoop whether the "500" wear bath-
I ing suits to the dancc —or bear skins,
i One would be ;is out of place as the
I other. The question is fundamentally
an aesthetic one. The formal of to
i day is sweeping, flowing—inclining,
perhaps, to the romantic. What a
: beautiful illusion it creates as it
slowly meanders along the inner
: court of the Women's Gym.
And what a beautiful illusion it
! smashes as it chances in front of a
i spot-light. At once, the glamour
' fades. The beauty is gone. We have
I nothing but two legs swathed in
i some flimsy cloth. Leg is considered
a fairly horrible word; but no place
is it worse than showing through a
formal gown (with the possible ex
ception of having an irate and mus
cular one pushed in your reporter's
face).
| The obvious remedy is petticoats,
i But with low-compression motors,
I they too have fled to oblivion. But
I a petticoat by any other name might
i be just as opaque. Call it what you
| will, it matters not. The only idea
j is to get something that keeps the
| light rays out. Heavier formals, lin -
j ings in formals, either would prob
ably solve all.
1 The fashion experts (see the Daily
today) say petticoats are coming
j back. I think the fashion experts are
i just typically expert—that is to say,
j wrong. It is clear that petticoats
j spoil the stream-line effects of our
j modern dresses and create annoying
j bulges and wrinkles on the body
beautiful. They are doomed.

But everything cannot go the way
of petticoats. Obviously, for the hu
man race would be left cold and
shivering. Something should be de
signed to take their place—now
while the need is only sobbing gen
tly. Soon it will become what all
needs eventually become, "crying
needs." Then it will be too late.
"Let there be light" is a beautiful
thought—but an impossible reality
without a substitute for petticoats.
Ol course, the lights could be turned
off, but 1 dance even worse in the
dark. I never would feel safe on a
poorly lighted dance-floor. When
these flashing, dashing Balboa Com
ets come whizzing along, it's run or
be smashed, f like to see them com
ing. ft gives me plenty of time to
run.
The only possible "argument"
against my non-silhouette arguments
is that "you see more at the beach."
Which is a statement of fact and no
argument at all. For if a woman
went swimming in Quad clothes, no
one would justify the inanity by
observing that she wears more at a
formal.
