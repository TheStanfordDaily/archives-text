### 
CASPAR, the Theta's great hunt
ing dog, ran off and made a day of
it . . . After being on the Theta
"missing" list for a few hours, the
hound returned to the fold resplend
ent with a shiny new coat—of paint.
IN AN ATTRACTIVE shade
of pink on one side of the Theta
menace to alley-cats and Chap
pie editors—was inscribed "Al
pha Delta Phi" . . . and the
other shouted "Kappa Alpha
Theta" . . . with additional
blemishes in pure black . . .
THE GIRLS WHO answer phones
at (5195 (that's it) decided to foist
the blame on to some big Dekes . . .
but the funny part of it all is the
fact that the Dekes were quite in
nocent . . . Blame the Beta's . . .
Caspar's paint job strongly re
sembled Winstead Weaver's heap of
junk . . .
HOWEVER, QUESTIONS are
being acked down at the house
regarding which two S.A.E.
sophomores managed to let six
quacking ducks loose on the
Kappa sleeping porch one dark
night about a week or so ago . . .
more to the point this time . . .
For the porch was full of Sleep
• ing Beauties at the time . . .
who awakened too late to catch
the invaders . . .
AND WHERE WAS Marion Hew
lett . . . the nights of the last two
"Depression" dances . . . ???
