BABE'S
BETTER B.Y.D.'S

(S.F. Examiner Fashion Writer)
AND NOW—the pants to wear
under the pants. Women almost
stopped traffic in front of a window
displaying the new "strictly tailored*'
undies, required for the new man
nish attire. . . . Need I add that
these pants are as brief as possible
, and fit like your very own skin?
j Cute as the dickens on any slim
figure. No step-ins, no ruffles, no
frills. What a slick figure they give
under evening clothes! Oh yes. the>
look like satin and wash like a
handkerchief.

QUITE SO
"Properly brewed beer—that with
a good lathery collar —need not be
, too strong. It must be balanced, hav
ing sufficient body to offset the al
cohol. Then it is full-mouthed,
! slightly heady, and eminently drink
able."—S.F. Examiner.
