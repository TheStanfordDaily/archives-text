## TYPE CASTING IN RELATION TO THE SON-DAUGHTER. 
### 
There seems to be some palliation
for the type-casting of such actors
as Boris Karloff and Charles Laugh
ton, lamentable as the latter action
wiil inevitably be. They are men of
an unusual appearance and the sys
tem of type-casting, constraining as
it is, has so long been in use that
it is now inescapable. Karloff, whose
capability at horrible make-up is as
incontestable as it is immaterial, is,
at bottom, a bad actor; he fails to
give any life or character even to his
less monstrous—and, more human —
creatures. Compare Warner Oland
and Karloff as Fu Manchu: the first
is suave, even real at his most ab
surd moments as the fiendish Doctor.
Karloff merely pastes a long mous
tache over his long, English fea
tures and flatly speaks his lines; he
creates no character; his menace is
unreal, unmoving.
Charles Laughton is prevented by
his size from playing many charac
ters; but in the theatre he had done
the horrible well. Hollywood there
fore cast him as a smiling menace
in three or four pictures; and why
of the latter, the fine "Payment De

calculating pen.
But why, on the other hand, an
actress like Helen Hayes should be
encouraged to repeat the charac
terization of the coy, winsome, sweet
maiden with each of her pictures is
not understandable. It is,1 grant, a
well-acted role, but it has been
virtually unvaried in "Arrowsmith,"
'"A Farewell to Arms," and "The
Son Daughter." The only times that
Miss Hayes has had an opportunity
to vary this character has been at
the climax of each picture when a
call for emotional display has proved
her capable of more than charming
but innocuous and eventually mean
ingless whimsy.
"The Son-Daughter," a ridiculous
Anglo-Caucasian melange, showed
her in a wig, speaking beposied
lines; but she was the same per
son, lifted eyebrows or no. The three
roles have, to be sure, been varied
in degree of whimsy, the Chinese
roles b'eing the most exaggerated as
ii was the most unworthy. The repe
tition of such charming but shallow
characteristics is bound, in time, to
make Miss Hayes seem no more
than a light-headed lackwit; they
no more bear frequent repetition

than a series of unvaried melodra
matic tricks: the female shriek, the
face at the window, the skeleton in
the closet. If repeated they lose their
effect.
Beyond this characterization —
which was the best thing about the
bad Son-Daughter — the film was
artificial, unexciting stuff made ludi
crous by a good cast forced to wear
odd beards and fingernails and
speak, O honorable crocus, of the
eternal beneficence of the most high
and serene Ostrich.
A revival of the long-dead thril
lers of the last century which, un
like the Fu Manchu tales, attempted
to take itself seriously, it was an
insult to the even poorer members
of the cast which played it.

his size from playing many charac
ters; but in the theatre he had done
the horrible well. Hollywood there
fore cast him as a smiling menace
in three or four pictures; and why
of the latter, the fine "Payment De

calculating pen.
But why, on the other hand, an
actress like Helen Hayes should be
encouraged to repeat the charac
terization of the coy, winsome, sweet
maiden with each of her pictures is
not understandable. It is,1 grant, a
well-acted role, but it has been
virtually unvaried in "Arrowsmith,"
'"A Farewell to Arms," and "The
Son Daughter." The only times that
Miss Hayes has had an opportunity
to vary this character has been at
the climax of each picture when a
call for emotional display has proved
her capable of more than charming
but innocuous and eventually mean
ingless whimsy.
"The Son-Daughter," a ridiculous
Anglo-Caucasian melange, showed
her in a wig, speaking beposied
lines; but she was the same per
son, lifted eyebrows or no. The three
roles have, to be sure, been varied
in degree of whimsy, the Chinese
roles b'eing the most exaggerated as
ii was the most unworthy. The repe
tition of such charming but shallow
characteristics is bound, in time, to
make Miss Hayes seem no more
than a light-headed lackwit; they
no more bear frequent repetition

than a series of unvaried melodra
matic tricks: the female shriek, the
face at the window, the skeleton in
the closet. If repeated they lose their
effect.
Beyond this characterization —
which was the best thing about the
bad Son-Daughter — the film was
artificial, unexciting stuff made ludi
crous by a good cast forced to wear
odd beards and fingernails and
speak, O honorable crocus, of the
eternal beneficence of the most high
and serene Ostrich.
A revival of the long-dead thril
lers of the last century which, un
like the Fu Manchu tales, attempted
to take itself seriously, it was an
insult to the even poorer members
of the cast which played it.

There seems to be some palliation
for the type-casting of such actors
as Boris Karloff and Charles Laugh
ton, lamentable as the latter action
wiil inevitably be. They are men of
an unusual appearance and the sys
tem of type-casting, constraining as
it is, has so long been in use that
it is now inescapable. Karloff, whose
capability at horrible make-up is as
incontestable as it is immaterial, is,
at bottom, a bad actor; he fails to
give any life or character even to his
less monstrous—and, more human —
creatures. Compare Warner Oland
and Karloff as Fu Manchu: the first
is suave, even real at his most ab
surd moments as the fiendish Doctor.
Karloff merely pastes a long mous
tache over his long, English fea
tures and flatly speaks his lines; he
creates no character; his menace is
unreal, unmoving.
Charles Laughton is prevented by
his size from playing many charac
ters; but in the theatre he had done
the horrible well. Hollywood there
fore cast him as a smiling menace
in three or four pictures; and why
of the latter, the fine "Payment De
