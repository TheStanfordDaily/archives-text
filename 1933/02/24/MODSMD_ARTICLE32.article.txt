# SPRING LIDS DIP SAUCILY
## Mannish Fedora Only Thing With Tailored Suits 
### 
Spring hats are just too utterly
different. Most of Ihem are tinier
than ever and feature all kinds of
straw on the market as well as
fabrics resembling cottons and pi
ll ues.
The Gibson girl comes into her
own again in 19.'J3 with sailors, of
extraordinarily shallow crowns,
pushed well forward over the nose.
Rocking chair hats are new and
saucy with their high banded backs
and down sloping brims, coming al
most to eye level. They are made
of straw, cloth, crepe, and a few of
felt.
The modishly mannish Fedora is
just right for the classic profile, and
the crowns are usually creased to
take away from the hard tailored
look. Fedoras are absolutely the
only thing with the new tailor-made
spring suits.
The Fez with its top middle tas
sel hasn't hit the Pacific coast in a
very serious way as yet, but it is
decidedly effective.
Knox is showing cruise and travel
hats of felt with a tricky metal and
leather band. They come in indi
vidual boxes almost as attractive as
the hats.
For sport's wear matching hats
and scarfs in black and white, blue
and white, and red and white checks
are extremely smart and practical.
HÂ»nd crochets and wool crepes have
a part to play too. Gold is one of
the very newest colors for sport
hats, to be worn in direct contrast
with the sports ensemble.
Dinner hats are still of the close
fitting turban variety, many of them
with tiny veils just over the eyes,
and some with round veils slightly
stiffened.
Floppy straw or linen brims three
or four inches wide, with plaid
calico and linen crowns are ideal for
country club or resort wear, and the
bonnet style has come to reside
alongside the many summer organ
dies.
The blue family leads the spring
color fashions, and a new peachy tan
will replace the darker winter
shades. Grey is still a favorite, and
black and white are expected to
hold their own. Bright green is
strikingly employed for accent.
