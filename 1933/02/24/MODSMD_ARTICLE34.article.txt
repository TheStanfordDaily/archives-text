# NEW TONES NEUTRAL
## 
### 
Neutral shades are the decree of
the season. Both woolens and silk
will be smartest in blue, string, ecru,
beige and fawn, greys, and soft
browns.
Most of the new prints have dark
backgrounds, navy, black, brown and
dark green. The new yellow-red is
popular likewise.
Plain materials boast the lighter
shades: pink-beige, tea-rose yellow,
apricot, peach and the popular new
faded tones, old blue, pink, grey
violet, and olive-green.
Several tones of the same shade,
especially in plain fabrics, will sat
isfy milady's flare for favorite col
ors.
Yellow is increasing in importance,
especially for evening. Blues still
flourish, new shades rich and
medium in tone.
The color question, Paris says, will
be controlled by the time of day.
Neutrals, ecru, beige, grey, soft
brown, and these combined with
white wiil be used for sports and
morning costumes. For afternoon
the popular combination is one color
with white, including magenta, pur
plish-reds, and red prune shades.
For evening appears a greater
variety of colors. Fresh, clear color
combinations with grey touches
brighten the prints. Pastels should
be successful, but the brilliant prints
most startling.
