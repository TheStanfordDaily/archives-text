# TIED SCARF SMART FAD
## Bright Bows Are Important For Sports Costume 
### 
Bright affeta and cerise ribbon
scarfs this spring are tied in large
bows on the right shoulder or are
box pleated to form a sort of ruffle

around the neck.
Chiffon neckwear
takes on a new
stj'le too. It is
worn so as to
form a cowl in
front, tied in the
back, and fas
tened with a
clip.
Taffeta scarfs
are found in both

pastel and vivid hues, solid color,
stripes, and plaids. One requisite of
all of these is fringed or fluted ends.
White scarfs are found this season
for the first time in years. All of
them are to be worn with strictly
tailored suits adding a feminine
touch to the mannish ensemble.
Lingerie trimming is the latest
thing for trimming on all types of
daytime frocks. The materials used
for cuffs, collars and large bows are
pique, mouseline de soie, and cross
bar organdy. The pique is some
times found in flowers but, generally
speaking, self-made bows are more
stylish.
Belts are of stitched leather cloth
made wider in front than in back
where they buckle. These are in
bright green, rose red, and melon, to
be worn with the neutral shades of
grey, biege, and navy blue.
Clips add another decorative touch
of the sporty character. These are
either silver or high shades of
enamel on silver in modernistic de
signs. They are worn in pairs at the
neck or on either side of the belt.
