# PARIS PREVUES
## 
### MARJE 
What a break! Actually just off
the Paris boat. And did she let me
in on the very newest new. Madame
Calmepe is a designer herself, and
she ought to know. Wait'll you hear
what they're doing "over there."
Muffs, my dear, but such tiny ones.
For evening they're simply covered
with flowers, dainty lacy cloth ones
you'd swear were the real things,
just about two handfuls of them.
And the perky down-over-one-eye
hats about salad plate size that match
them are all flowered too. The muffs
have a big frill of chiffon on the
edges besides.
Daytime muffs for street and tea
are just as small but they are of
shiny Persian lamb. Dresses have
entire sleeves of soft furs.
Those well dressed French women
are knitting their own sports hats,
those of them who can't crochet,
with scarfs to match. The dinkies
sit high on the head with only an
inch wide roll of self material for
trimming. Straw and felt sailors are
popular for sports wear as well.
Guess what? Plaid and check or
gandies in gayest colors are all the
rage, and large floppy hats are worn
, with them.
Sleeves are awfully important.
Crushed velvet for the tag end of
winter, and rows and rows of little
, chiffon flowers for spring. It's a big
year for small flowers. Sleeves are
frilly and puffy too.
Grey, beige, black, and white are
sure hits, and a very special bright
red is on the way.
Believe it or not, America has
beaten Paris to long skirts for street.
Dinner and formal dresses are ankle
length though.
! Lacquered hair actually! The coif
fures simply must match the gowns,
and long hair is coming back. For

street weaV they're blending it right
into the hats.
Some stockings are silk and cot
ton mixtures, but awfully good look
ing.
Did you know the French have a
special silky rayon lor undies? Lots
of punch hole embroidery is being
used in the trims.
Gloves are rather long, and for
tailored wear have wide Hairing ap
pliqued cuffs.
The tri-colored shawl collar that
crosses in the front and ties in the
back comes from way back when.
Paris is decidedly period, but
styles are more feminine than ever,
and oh so flattering!
