# SPRING CALLS FOR NATURAL MAKE-UP
## 
### 
Look natural this spring. Of
course, make-up will be worn, but
it must only enhance that which
Nature has given mi-

lady and not be obvious
in itself.
Rouge will be worn
high on the cheekbone
to accomplish this effect.
Eye-make-up is vita!,
since the new hats are
worn so low on the fore
head. For daytime the

shadow is softly and lightly ap
plied; for evening, it is more pro
nounced.
Make-up will be worn to comple
ment the color scheme. For deep
colors, the complexion should be
white. For bright tones, the skin
will take on a gayer, livelier tone;
but never too vivid.

A smart item in the perfect cos
tume, especially in the daytime, is
hosiery which matches the fur worn.
