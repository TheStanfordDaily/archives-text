# WOMEN TO DON PANTS
## Slacks Replace Pajamas Tor Sport Occasions 
### 
Feminine? Well, mebbe.
At any rate, Marlene Dietrich is
reported to have started it allâ€”this
business of men's pants for women.
And, while Hollywood may take it
up for street or evening, the rest
of the world will confine its trousers
to sport and resort wear.
Slacks of all sorts of men's flan
nels and tweeds are being shown for
resort wear, to be worn with a
matching vest. Leather or cloth vests,
leather jackets, and polo shirts are
other alternatives offered. The oc
casion may be anything from ten
nis to bridge on a country club
porch.
Some of the slacks are made with
pleats, large buttons, and patch
pockets although all are matters of
choice.
Linen or cotton weaves are pre
ferred for beach slacks, with one
intriguing model made of trans
parent mesh. Overalls are another
suggestion made by a screen star.
Here also, matching vests are worn.
One enterprising buyer has pa
tented a trouser-skirt, seamed
around the bottom to simulate a cuff
and with an inverted box-pleat in
the middle.
