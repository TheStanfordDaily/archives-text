# CAPE VOGUE NEWEST
## 
### 
The cape's the thing this season.
And ranging through every hour
of the day, in almost any situation,
the cape is predominant, and useful
no end.
For street clothes, especially suits,
capes are most noticeable. Tweed
and rough materials, even flannels,
are more attractive >vith the long,
graceful accessory, which has almost
ceased to become such, it's been a
long time since capes were "in." and
many of the smartest will feel, per
haps, the lack of a tambourine the
first time they don one. But every
one will wear them.
Contrasting shades and fabrics are
also evident. A bright suit-cape over
sport clothes is promising. For street
dresses and afternoon things, the
shorter cape, for the suit-cape it
generally three-quarters, is best.
From shoulder to waist they range,
and attractively, too.
For dinner dresses and formal:;,
capes are even more fetching. Great
or small, in contrasting materials or
colors, sheered, ruffled, be-feathered,
the smart frock is caped. And for
variety, a new dress is created when
the cape is added or removed.
