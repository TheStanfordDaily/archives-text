Out of the pages of a "Godcy's
Fashion Magazine" of 1890 steps
Betty Co-ed on her way to THE
Formal. Her dress no longer shows
the severe sophistication of last sea
son. Today she seems the very spirit
of spring in the crispest of organdies,
the daintiest of mousselines de soie
or the sheerest of chiffons. Her neck
line is high and often draped with
row upon row of tiny ruffles simu
lating leis. Her waistline is slightly
lower.
Growing tired of such frivolity she
may choose taffeta, which is again
coming into its own. But no longer
do the taffetas remain pale. Now
Ihey are bursting into checks, stripes
and plaids. If Betty does choose a
plain color, she is sure to add an
unusual note in the way of pique
jackets or velvet sashes.
To accommodate her sleeves which
are bigger than ever she wears a
wrap with voluminous "uppers."
They are puffed or touched at the
shoulders and fit tightly from wrist
to elbow.
