# SUEDE COAT STYLE STAR
## Bright Leather Jackets Are Summer Feature 
### 
The humble calf comes into his
own this spring. New leather coats
galore with lower prices and larger
variety. Most of them are short, and
the longer ones are belted in back
to hug the waist line.
Suede is the season's best bet, and
it's coming in all kinds of colors,
with a lot of two-tone effects, trim
med in nice shiny metal buttons.
One of the best looking numbers
shown is in Nile green with a front
panel of darker green running up
around the neck and down the back.
The cuffs are dark green too.
They're going to wear sleeveless
jackets with zipper short-sleeved
shirts of basket weaves in white and
pastel shades, with matching zipper
skirts.
The short mannish coats and vests
are just made to go with the new
slacks. You can get the lapels and
collars in washable calf too, which
is the best feature of the new styles.
Suede military jackets with match
ing or contrasting washable collars
are an economical and edifying ad
dition to the spring wardrobe.
Pockets are subtly slipped into the
seams unless they are of contrasting
color or trimmed with silver buttons
or fancy clips. Most of the sleeveless
leather vests have no pockets since
the now skirts come well equipped.
Grey is one of the best new colors
and the darker winter blues and
greens have given way to pastel
tones. Black and white, tan and
beige combinations, are very dif
ferent.
Collars are out in the briefer
j.nkots, but the golf coast are still
featuring them. Many of the necks
are bound, and the round neck has
a slight edge for general wear. The
vests have a deep "V" ending some- I
times in a tasseled zipper, and often
not opening .at all.
None of the belts go all the way
around, but a lot of the coats have
an inconspicuous belt across the
back to make the hips flare.
Some of the long sleeves have an
extra cap effect at the top, and one
or two of them have raglan should
ers.
An unusual model crosses low in
the front and fastens with two but
tons on the side. Most of the shorter
jackets have buttons or buckles on
the side, but the vests and military
coats hang straight from the shoul
der.
Leather jackets are better this year
than ever before, and they're made
for all sports occasions.
