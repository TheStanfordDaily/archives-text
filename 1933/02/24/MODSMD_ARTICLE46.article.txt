# SLENDER WRISTED EFFECT ENHANCED BY SPRING GLOVES
## 
### 
Slim wrists will be at a premium
this season in line with the Ed
wardian, feminine trend.
As a result, the new design in
gloves will enhance the slim-wristed,
delicate feminine effect, achieved by
decided shaping at the wrist, with
enough top fullness to allow for fit
ting over coat and suit sleeves.
The practical and economical slant
of the times will bring fabric gloves
to the fore earlier than ever.
The fashion for color contrast
makes it eminently correct to wear
gloves that contrast —dark gloves
with light or bright costumes, and
light gloves with dark ensembles.
Even deftly adopting bright red
gloves to give a navy blue outfit
real impertinence.
There is a pitfall here, however,
for the woman without a depend
able instinct, who runs the danger
of ill-assorting her contrast of ac
cessories, and turns out in a
mottled-looking effect, to carry the
illustration to extremes, of a navy
suit, lemon yellow blovi.se, white
gloves and red bag.'
However, the startling leeway in
contrasting accessories marks a
radical fashion move of Ihe season—
just after mankind has been taught
to notice and appreciate the expert
grooming accomplishment of the
woman who has, heretofore, ap
peared with accessories matching to
the 'nth detail in sade and fabric.
The season's most useful costume
the short-sleeved plaid dress of
light, wqolen, and a plain-colored
swagger coat, with a jaunty cap and
an alluring bow.
