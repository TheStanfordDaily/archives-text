# PRINTS COLORFUL; AMUSING MIXTURES IN NEW MATERIALS

### MARY LEE RICHMOND 
(Stall of Ilale Bros.)
Prints will be fun this year. One
I of the most important is the scroll
effect, looking much as if the artist
had taken his brush and dabbed
away merely to amuse himself, pro
ducing a charmingly casual, almost
futuristic effect.
Dots will be good, with variations
and unusual arrangements distin
guishing them from the orthodox dot
of the past. The popular and fasci
nating geometric patterns are smart
er than ever. The modern stripe
with crinkley crepe background in
tensifying the waviness of the stripe,
and the mannish stripe, an idea
taken from men's suiting, pecularly
appropriate in a year of mannish
fashions, will be employed.
Floral patterns will be more deli
cate on the whole this season. Even
the multicolored, bright and gay pat
terns printed on novelty silks will
be restrained in size.
One of the most interesting pat
terns evolved is a delicately traced
curious design strikingly resembling
the strange effects seen under lab
oratory microscopes by researchers
in protoplasm.
Edwardian, old-fashioned shades
such as cerise, coral, and pink will
be featured in all these new types
of prints.
