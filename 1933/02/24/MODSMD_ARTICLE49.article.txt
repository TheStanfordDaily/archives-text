# PLUS-FOURS, COLOR BANNED FOR GOLF
## 
### 
The plus,-fours, plus-eights, plus
sweaters of gaudy hue and socks to
match have become things of the
past as far as apparel for the stylish
male golfer is concerned.

According to the latest fashion
returns, as given by merchandisers
with a finger on the public pulse,
the "smoothie" golfer wears slacks
and sweaters of quiet and subdued
hues. The greatest favoritism is, in
deed, shown toward shades of grey
or brown, with sweaters either
matching or harmonizing. How
ever, for the sportsman who insists
on a gaudy environment for his
golf a white sweater can be worn.
