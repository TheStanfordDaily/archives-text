# NEW DRESS COATS FEATURE UNUSUAL COLLARS, SLEEVES
## 
### 
Dress coats are different. An en
tirely new neck line is being
stressed by the most up-to-the-min
ute designers.
A small self-collar can be worn
either with or without a fur scarf,
J depending on the climate. It may be
adjusted to be worn open, half
closed, or completely closedâ€”in the
latter case to protect the wearer
from the cool "trade winds" or fogs
of the Bay Region.
Many of the new dress coats are
designed to fall straight from the
shoulder. Regular and "kimono" as
well as raglan sleeves are good.
Some of the coats are slightly nipped
lat the waistline, and others are
really tight-fitting.
New coat lengths vary from the
modish short jacket of 22 inches to
full length.
