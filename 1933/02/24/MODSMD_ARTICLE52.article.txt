# LASTEX IS SPRING BET
## Novel Knits Capture Mode For All Occasions 
### 
Lastex, the most novel cloth to be
j featured this season, is a new knit
earning its name by its elasticity.
Guaranteed to meet any demands
made by the wearer, lastex will snap
back into shape on the hanger and
preserve its original appearance for
an indefinite period of time. Turban
1 hats to fit any head, suits of one, two,
or three pieces, bathing t suits, and
even- unmentionables will be avail
able in the fascinating material. The
patterns and colors will be varied,
and the more daring the design, the
more voguish will it be.
Briella, a fine celanese, is to be
j used for sports wear of the "tea at
the Country Club" type. Candy
i stripes for those who are still on
that spring diet, and flashy, geome
tric prints in brilliant colors for
those who dare, will be in evidence
at the Boat House and the golf
course. This smooth silk has a tex
, ture similar to the softest jersey
and is the right weight for these in
determinate days that are fair but
j not warmer.
Rough crepes tn'e declared the
thing for afternoon and evening, and
there are to be no glistening gowns
no matter how formal the occasion.
: A blistered effect is obtained by the
new Cloque Crepe that is favored
j for dinner dresses and their accom-
I panying jackets.
Cellophane will definitely not be
used for swimming apparel. The only
use it will find this season will be
as a trim on sports hats, in a few
beach pajamas, and as a menace to
smokers.
The key-note is rough materials
that fit smoothly which would be a
paradox if it were not applied to
feminine fashions.
