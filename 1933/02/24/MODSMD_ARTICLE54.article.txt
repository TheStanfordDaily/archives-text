reached the stage where it is neces
sary to stipulate whether they are
for day or night wear. The superior

wear.

garments is an important and chang
ing situation. The main change
seems to be one of geography—
where it used to be Russia it is now
Scotland. The high-netxed, gaudy
pajamas with vivid coats of arms
are being largely replaced by gar
ments of a Scottish motif. The coats
are in lively shades of plaid while
the trousers are plain white with
suffs of the same material as the
coat.
