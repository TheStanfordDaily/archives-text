# BLOUSE CONTRASTS VIVIDLY WITH SKIRT
## 
### 
Fashion has tired of the old shirt
waist, and has loaded this spring's
output with many and varied types
of blouses.
No matter what sort or color skirt
is worn, the blouse is loud. Red and
white checks are gaining popularity.
The Fascisti influence is also mak
ing itself felt with the innovation of
the black shirt which makes a stun
ning combination when worn with
a white skirt.
The darker the upper half in con
trast to a light skirt, the more in
fashion the wearer is. Both tuck-ins
and long ones are being worn, with
shoulders and sleeves receiving the
most attention. Plaid is one of the
big notes of the spring fashions,
while a big bow under the chin will
go a long way toward giving that
new appearance.
