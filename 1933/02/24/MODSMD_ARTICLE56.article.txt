# BICYCLE COATS
## 
### 
Enter the "Bicycle Coat," reminis
cent of fifty and more years ago.
Fitted at the waistline, snug at the
hips, and distinctly form fitting,
these coats have striking sleeve de
signs, large and "leg-o'-muttoned"
at the shoulder.
Short veils are still being worn,
often with fiat disks of velvet here
and there, reminiscent of eighteenth
century patches.

Shoes, those innocent little things,
can ruin or make an outfit.
For the street costume the one
eyelet pump is the latest creation.
With it goes a new heel, daintier
than street heels have been for some
time. It is thinner and possibly a
little bit taller. Another new fea
ture is the pointed tongue.
An entirely new type of shoe has
been introduced for the swagger
sport, which resembles somewhat
the cuban-heeled summer sandals of
hist year, with some important
changes, of course. The strap is
broader and the toes slightly more
rounded, giving a more substantial
; look.
Those who are looking for some
thing in sport oxfords —for the cam
pus or for golf—must be reminded
that pigskin is rapidly replacing kid,
i elkskin, and others in ever-popular
black-and-white or brown-and
white summer oxfords.
Perhaps the fewest changes in
shoe styles are noted in the dressy
afternoon and evening slippers. The
low-cut single strap pump and san
dal will remain the fad of the day.
Those who wish to make big feet
look small can actually do so this
summer. Certain factories have just
i introduced shoes with rounder toes
i and shorter vamps, which give the
impression of having been made to
fit tiny feet only.
