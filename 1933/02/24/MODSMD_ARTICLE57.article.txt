# SORBONNE CO-EDS LACK PARIS CHIC
## 
### 
Who would believe it? A much
traveled member of the "500" re
ports that Frenchwomen at the
world-famed Sorbonne are probably
the least stylishly dressed co-eds to
be found on any campus anywhere. 1
Black serge dresses and black cot
ton hose, serviceable but unbeauti
ful, are found there in great profu
sion, and it is the American students
who are distinguished by their taste
io apparel.
English girls are prone to heavy
brogues and rather badly cut gar
ments, and on the whole display j
very little style.
It is a faux pas of the worst sort
for any woman to appear on the
streets of Paris without a hat as well j
as gloves. It just isn't done.
