# NEW HAIRDRESSING STYLES EMPHASIZE INDIVIDUALITY IN KEEPING WITH HATS
## 
### 
It seems as how short hair is> still
and even more so "the thing," at
last it's the bob, short, long, or me
dium which is leading the pace in

spring fashions. In
dividuality is really
the point of stress.
Much thought must
be given to hair i
styles this season
because they must
be in keeping with,

and as smart as, the new hats.
The upward trend of the new hats
has much to do with the fact that
new coiffeurs are smooth on top
and feature intricate detail below
the crown. To retain unity of line
to the head, hair must be lifted
above the neckline. The bob with
the full line at the neck is the best
working arrangement for the new
styles. Instead of having a myriad
j of compact curls to finish at the
neckline, a less formal line of more
careless wispy curls is preferred.
Tiny up-tilted fringe at the hair
line is one way of terminating those

luscious soft waves which fall from
the new sleek crowns. And very
heavy bangs 01* a perfectly exposed
forehead seems to be favored rather
than the half and half idea of a few
wisps at each temple or curls at the
part.
For the women with short, shaped
hair, some great mind has created an
attractive chignon to be attached for
formal wear. This consists of a comb
which fits snugly in the hair and is
completely covered with a coronet
of curls. there's very little the
"skoits" won't do in the way of
beaux-catching.
Simplicity is the keynote of jew
elry fashions for this year. With
built-up necks and tailored lines of
dresses no necklaces are necessary.
The emphasis falls on earrings and
braclets.
