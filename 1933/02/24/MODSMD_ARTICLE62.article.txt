# Tricky Togs Now For Men
## Bright-Colored Wikies Seen For Lagunita Wear 
### 
Featuring a worsted plaid jacket,
tailored along coat rather than
sweater lines. Koos Bros, shows the
must radical : ports wear of the new
men's spring ensemble. This jacket
sweater is the only deviation from
the leather jacket which has proved
successful. There is a zipper for the
entire front of the jacket, a neck
built up as in a suit-coat, trim,
streamlined pockets, and cutaway
lines.
Following last year's tendency to
expose a maximum body surface to
old Sol. swimming suits are practi
cally like la L summer, except that
colors will be more violent. The
canary-colored wikies sponsored by
Pete Des Jardines, which immedi
ately brought two dozen similar or
ders from campus admirers, are only
a mild forerunner of what is to be
expected this season.
The suits will be in flashy colors,
and then piped or outlined in con
trasting shades. Thus, maroon-col
ored wikies with gold piping will
undoubtedly bi worn by Southern
California swimmers, with Stanford
colors practically ; certainty soon in
Paly stores.
Slack socks, developing from the
college man's abhorrence to garters,
are sure to be a popular vogue this
season. In sweaters, houndstooth,
cheeks, guncloek checks, and Glen
ruquhart plaids will take (he place
of one-tone shades.
Neckties for spring wear will be
again the Foulard*:---these of course
in shades and fabrics. Their
main idea is to be comfortable, and
checks, dois, and plaid patterns are
ill I acceptable.
