# S.F.U., STANFORD FROSH TRACK MEN MEET TOMORROW
## 
### 
Faced with the usual pre-season
paradox of several stars and several
glaring weaknesses, the fieshman
track squad, as yet untried, will
meet San Franckco University's
equally unknown freshman team at
2:15 o'clock tomorrow afternoon on
the Stanford practice track.

Must promising of the freshman
talent is Chuck Nimmo, miler and
two-milcr, who hails from Holly
wood High. In recent practices,
Nimmo has been clocked in the fast
times of 4:30.7 and 9:56.5. Two hur
dlers, Sam Klopstock and Hunting
ton Kingsbury, complete the list of
talented tracksters.
Klopstock has but a slight edge
over his teammate, having turned
in under 10 seconds in the bigh s >
and under 26 in the lows.
Kingsbury broke 15 seconds in the
highs while in high school, but has
failed to come up to past perform
ances.
Weights Promising
The weights, in keeping with
Stanford custom of recent years, are
well fortified. George Leedy with
126 in the discus, and Bob Reynolds
with 43 feet in the shot, are the best
performers to date. Holloway, Hud
son, and Calloway have been right
on their heels.
High-jumper Don Aibertson,
who has gone (i'l", has been
found ineligible. Elliot Jones,
with 5'11", is now best man.
Chuck Jonas has proved the best
vaulter, with 12 feet his present
limit. Ginn follows with 11'6".
Javelin Weak
As yet no one has been found in
the javelin, broad jump, 440, and
880.
Lloyd Davis, leading quarter
miler, is doing about 15 seconds.
Mangan, sole javelin prospect, has
quit for baseball. No broad-jumper
has done over 19 feet, and few wins
can be. hoped for in this section.
