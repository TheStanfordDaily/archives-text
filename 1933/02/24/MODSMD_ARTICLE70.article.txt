# Frosh Netmen To Meet San Mateo Tomorrow
## 
### 
Meeting the strong San Mateo J.C.
team tomorrow morning, the babe
netmen will find themselves in store
for their third and by far hardest
practice match yet played.
A strong junior college team, led
by such veterans as Doumer, Ma
rinez, and four other strong racket
wielders, will undoubtedly give
closer competition than last week's
one-sided match against Lowell.
Johnny Law, frosh net captain,
will of course take the number one
assignment, and Dan Clark the sec
ond singles.
