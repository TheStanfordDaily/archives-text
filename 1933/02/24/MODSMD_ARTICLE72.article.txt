# Babe Batsmen Down Sequoia
## 
### 
All set to go once more after an
18 to 6 landslide win over the Se
quoia High School nine, Stanford's
yearling baseball team tangles with
an aggregation from Berkeley High
at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning on
,he freshman diamond.
The Sequoia game, played yes
terday afternoon, saw the babes
returning to the form that
caused them to be rated a com
ing team at the beginning of the
year.
Staging a field day in the second
nning the first-year boys put. the
3ame on ice by driving ten runs
across the plate on a combination
of hits, walks, and Sequoia errors.
Monk Moscrip opened with a home
run and three Stanford singles con
tributed to the yearling barrage.
As the game was called at the end
of the sixth, the Babes decided it
would be a good idea to collect
more tallies for good measure so
they accordingly blasted out six
runs in this inning.
Francliesci and Don Clark di
vided the pitching assignment
for Stanford and did creditable
work. Leading in the slug
ging department were Grayson
and Moscrip with home runs.
Galbraith, Marshal!, Don Clark,
and Morgan all garnered two
singles apiece and contributed
to the scoring spree.
Coach Murray Cuddeback intends
to start Franchesci, ihc sou'hpaw
lob artist, on the mound tomorrow
morning against the Berkeley High
lads. Don Clark will be held in re
serve and Morgan will start as
catcher.
Due to an ankle injury, Tremainc,
â€¢egular third-baseman, will be un
able to play. Marshall will hold
down the "hot corner" in his ab
sence.
National guardsmen recently col
lected 118 automatics, pistols, and
rifles from the Taylorville mine dis
trict.
