# STANFORD NINE, BRONCOS PLAY DECIDING GAME
## 
### Frank Tremaine 
Playing the deciding game of their
series, Stanford and Santa Clara
ballplayers will tangle on the Sunk
en Diamond at 2:30 o'clock tomor
row afternoon.
Coach Harry Wolter's charges
are slight favorites to lake the
Broncos, due to their decisive
1!) to 0 victory over St. Mary's
Wednesday. Santa Clara won
the first game of the series 7 to 0
in a comedy of errors, hut the
Indians put on a much-improved
exhibition to capture the second
game last Saturday !) to 5.
Stark or Estes
Either Harry Stark, who let the
Broncs down with seven hits last
Saturday, or Herman Estes will
probably open the game in the box
with Captain Ike Livermore or Jim
Massey behind the plate.
The rest of the line-up will prob
ably be as usual, with Mallatratt at
fust, Woolley and Delmas forming
the keystone combination, Traut
man on third, and Irsfeld, Maggiora,
and Miles in the outfield.
Idiart, Judnich, and Golsing have
been the biggest thorns in the side
of Stanford pitchers, leading the
Broncos' attack in both games
Walter Mails will probably send
McCoy or Burke to the mound with
O'Donnell, Judnich, Golsing, and
Cunningham in the infield, and
Dowd, Idiart, and Beckrich in the
outfield.
