Spring is here, and so are a multi
tude of bright new colors, diiferent
designs, fascinating feminine foibles,
and decidedly unique fashion fea
tures.
Masterfully mannish modes
arc worn in direct contrast to
frivolous femininity as displayed
in fluffy formats and draped af
ternoon dresses.
Tailored suits require tailored ac
cessories. Fedoras, sailors, and se
vere little straws with slightly
deeper crowns are required, while
blight scarfs are worn to set off
I the severity of the suit.
Lines Straighter
Western designers are recom
mending appliqued net for evening,
and satin is still good. Lace, organdy,
mussiline de sois,- crinkly crepes, a
surprising amount of woolens, fur
capes and scarfs, linen, and lots of
cotton are imperative.
Lines are straighter and waist
lines slightly lower. Necklines
are still high, hut they empha
size the draped bateau hacks.
Sleeves are of moderate fullness
except for the extra large fills at
the shoulders of evening gowns.
Two-piece dresses are extensively
shown when dresses with related
long coats, jackets or capelets, often
contrasting in color, are not worn.
The beach dress Is endorsed but
without neglcct of pajamas. Plus
1 fours and the very popular slacks
are worn for sport.
Dresses to Instep
Instep length has been adopted
for evening, occasionally with trains,
and bridge dresses measure six or
seven inches from the floor, while
daytime shirts average 10, 11, or
sometimes longer distance.
Blue is thhe favored daytime
color with black and string,
embracing grege. beific, and
putty tying for second place.
Orange shades of red are out
standing bright colors. Contrasts
are very popular.
Evening wear stresses misty
blues, pearly tints, and the various
more familiar pastels.
Jewelry is fitted into the dress
design. Gloves in novelty fabrics in
cluding taffeta, organdie, satin, and
linen are ultra smart.
Varied Chapcaux
Hat trends are too numerous to
mention briefly. They range from
impudent caps to floppy garden va
rieties. Brims go both up and down,
and there is no limit to the materials
used in fashioning them.
Period influence is the keynote of
spring styles. Gibson Girl, Direc
toire, and Tyrolian are in the lead.
