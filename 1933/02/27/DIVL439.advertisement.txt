WHAT?
:
Advertising ?
Frederick C. Kendall, vditor of
Advertising 3C Selling, says,
''Advertising is still young. Yet
it is already a vital part of every
important industry. The pro
fessional advertising man must
be not only a thoughtful student
of human nature, but also a stu
dent of all American business."
SPARKING" ideas are the life
blood of advertising. That's
why advertising men, as well as
college men, turn to a pipe. For a
good pipe with the right tobacco
is man's first-aid to clear thinking
and wisdom. As for the "right
tobacco" — that's Edgeworth
Smoking Tobacco.*
Just one puff will tell you why.
/t"s that truly individual blend of
fine old hurleys—a blend you find
only in Edgeworth. Once you try
Edgeworth, nothing less will do.
