CHINCHOW, Manchuria, Feb. 2f»
(A') Like a gian! gate 250 miles long
hinged at Shanhaikwan, the Japa
neSe-Manchukuoan advance swing
ing into the Chinese province of
Jehol already has .swept across the
eastern third of the province.
Shanhaikwan, Chinese city south
of the Great Wall where it dips
down to the sea, was taken by the
Japanese in January after heavy
fighting.
At least two Japanese columns
of troops have advanced more
than sixty miles from the Man
churian border into the North
ern China territory.
The Fourth Cavalry Brigade of
Major General Kennosuke Mogi has
pushed southward from Kailu and
occupied Hsinglunti, which is fifty
miles due west of Suitun. From
that point he was reported continu
ing his advance.
Lieutenant General Yoshikazu
Nishi, driving to the west from Hao
yang, was reported approaching
Chienping.
Chinese officials Saturday denied
that the Japanese had occupied
Kailu, as reported by military au
thorities of that nation.
Officials of the Chinese na
tional government at Nanking
also denied that the Jehol key
positions of Peipaio and Chao
yang had been abandoned by the
Japanese.
Chaoyang is the second largest
city in the province. Sunday, how
over, a Chinese communique at Pei- j
ping said both Chaoyang and Kailu |
had been abandoned by Chinese l
troops and that both cities were in
ruins.
Chat >yang was said to be in I
flames.
Cold weather prevailed on most
of the battlefields. That was said to
be the worst enemy encountered by
the cavalry of General - Mogi, which
went into action in the face of sub- ■
zero winds which drove before it j
desert sands mixed with snow.
