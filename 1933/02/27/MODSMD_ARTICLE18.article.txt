# Helen Jacobs Frowns On 'Trou' For Tennis Wear
## 
### Collier Connell 
No "tennis trou" for Helen Jacobs;
with white frock flying, the be
skirted champion of the United
States herself backed up this edict
on the Stanford varsity courts this
week-end.
"I can't see myself appearing
in shorts," she said, "hut I once
vowed that about bare legs!"
Arching a foot rooted in a wisp
of tennis sock.
The Jacobs face and body are as
interesting as the Jacobian serve—
and as firm. A §turdy, non-willow
build, almost inelastic, so straight is
it held. Herculoan arms, narrow
steel ankles, and personable knees.
A sophisticated face, brown and
angular, staring by its green eyes.
Careful lipstick; and superb poise
of manner.
Likes Stanford Courts
The wind dying down just in time
for her two sets with blonde Sammy
Lee, who looks like a tennis-version
of Ben Eastman, Miss Jacobs ap
proved highly of (he Stanford courts

Wimbledon is her favorite court, i
out of a world-range of choices, but
despite the sprinkling of kings and '
queens at English and continental i
matches, she declares the American |
tennis gallery more stimulating to j
play before, that it creates a gayer !
tennis mood.
Negates Colleges
The most exciting match of her
life Miss Jacobs credits to the 1932 !
Paris competition, and her losing j
sets against the Britisher Eileen I
Whitingstall Bennett.
Lcnglcn and Tilden Epic
"Suzanne Lcnglcn" she labels j
as "the most picturesque tennis
figure" of history, and as for
the Beowulf among men, "there's
no one who towers above Bill
Tilden."
"Tennis champions are not made
at college," Miss Jacobs declares,
spite the surface evidence of Vines
from U.S.C., Lott from Chicago, and j
Van Ryn from Princeton. Tennis
ability is rot inseparably linked with :
n campus."
