# INDIAN CAGERS LOSE TO BEARS IN FINAL GAME
## Eifert Has Scoring Spree To Lead California's 41-23 Victory 
### Albert Guerard 
Too mwfi Harold Eifert spelled
defeat ara the end of a disappoint
ing season for the Stanford basket
ball team at Berkeley Saturday
night. California's flashy forward
scored 22 points, one less than the
whole Stanford team could make,
and was the biggest factor in his
team's 41-23 victory over John
Bunn's faltering Indians. Saturday
night's game' closed the season for
both teams.
California without Eifert would
have been like the Navy without
San Francisco or Gus Meier without
a flight of hurdles. Six of the Bear
forward's ten baskets were made on
one-handed, leaping shots inside the
foul line. Determined to gain South
ern Division scoring honors for their
ace shooter, the rest of the Cali
fornia players confined their activity
to "feeding" Eifert under the basket.
Eifert Beats Piper
Their aim was fulfilled. Saturday
night's "Eifert orgy" left the Bear
star in possession of the league title
with 131 points, nosing out
U.C.L.A.'s Don Piper, who scored
128.
With Keith Topping performing in
rare form, Stanford quickly stepped
into the lead at the start of the
game; were ahead 7-2 at the end of
six minutes of play. The big Indian
center made five free throws in five
attempts during the first half, con
trolled the tip-off much of the time
from Jack Read, and played an all
around fine game. But before the
half was well under way, Eifert be
gan his disastrous spree which gave
the Bears an 18-13 lead at the inter
mission.
Take Few Shots
During nineteen and a half min
utes of the second half, Stanford
failed t'o make a single field goal. In
the other thirty seconds, A1 Page
and Topping made two set-up shots
in quick succession. Other than this
momentary flurry, the spectators'
second-half budget showed a few
Stanford free throws, some isolated
field goals by California reserve
players, and half a dozen astonishing
shots emanating from the finger-tips
of the uncanny Eifert.
Stanford took only 41 shots at the
basket dui-ing the gameâ€”about half
the customary number. California
aimed at the net 76 times, making a
fine percentage good. Keith Topping
left the game midway through the
second half on personal fouls, but
while in the game he made 12 points,
and was the driving force behind
the Stanford offense. The guarding
of senior John Hancock was a heart
ening feature of Stanford's play; the
good floor game of sophomore A1
Page boded well for thi> future.
Seven End Careers
Three men in the Stanford starting
lineup were playing their last game,
Hancock, Captain Tom Cordry, and
Bill Schnetka. Captain Jack Read,
John Crowley, Ted Ohashi, and
Larry Seifert did their last damage
for the Bear cause.
Saturday's game had no bearing
on the Southern Division title race
which ended as follows:
Won Lost
U.S.C 10 1
California 8 3
Stanford 3 8
U.C.L.A 1 10
