# Satiric Comedy Emphasized In 'Enemy' Cutting
## 
### 
Emphasizing the satiric comedy of
An Enemy of the People," Director
Harold Helvenston, through judi
cious cutting and careful attention
lo characterizations, is preparing the
| Ibsen opus for presentation Friday
1 night.
The five-act play is a satire on the'
government and petty political af
| fairs of a small town, and Helven
| ston's deft cutting is designed to
make it a quick and direct play with
definite "follow through."
Characterizations Retained
Humor of line and idea are com
bined with humor of characteriza
tion, particularly in James Sandoe's
; interpretation of Dr. Thomas Stock
mann. medical director of the Muni
i cipal Baths. This is Sandoe's first
' starring rule, and he promises to do
j the best work of his career. Comedy
was the keynote of his Mr. Throstle,
"the dead-and-buried little pip
squeak" of "Berkeley Square" and
of his Mr. Blanquct, the sardine
salesman of "Bird in Hand." Not so
broad is the comedy of Dr. Stock
mann; it is, rather, comedy of char
acterizationâ€”a kindly, subtle humor
: which permeates the play.
New Feminine Stars
Peter Stockmann, brother of the
doctor, and 'lord-high-everything
el.se of the town, is a bumptious ass in
| whose character is much of the most
i brilliant comedy and satire of the
piece. A. Grove Day promises a
memorable interpreteation of this
I role.
The feminine leads are played by
Mary Ann Crary and Fritzi-Beth
Bowman, as the wife and daughter
;of Thomas Stockmann. Both are
newcomers, and are expected to
j make auspicious debuts.
A number of actors have been
I added to the meeting scene of Act
; IV, including many who have had
I prominent parts in previous plays:
June Birchard, Mildred King, Gor
don Heche, Walt Newcomb, Robert
| Broughton, Dave Devlin, Lawrence
Wallace, Lloyd Phillips, Darrell
| Ross, and Lee Rogers, a local child
i actor.
