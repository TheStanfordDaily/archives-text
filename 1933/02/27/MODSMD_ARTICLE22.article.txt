# Bassett To Read Works Of Masefield Tomorrow
## 
### 
"An Hour with John Masefieid"
will be presented by Professor L. E.
Bassett, head of the Division of
Public Speaking, to a Little Theatre
audience tomorrow evening at 7:30
o'clock.
Professor Bassett will give a short
account of the life and worlds of
England's poet laureate and present
a number of readings. Some of
Masefield's lyric an ddialect poems
will be included as well as "Reynard
the Fox" and "Dauber."
"Reynard the Fox" was written
following the war to divert attention
from the recent conflict, and is well
adapted to reading because of the
story and action.
"Dauber" is a study of a young
man who went to sea to paint but
life was made miserable by the sail
ors. The atmosphere of the sea is
here created with as much feeling as
in Masefield's widely read "Salt
Water Ballads."
