## Hitting Honors Won By Trautman, Delmas, Livermore WIN CINCHES SERIES Stanford Takes Lead With Three Runs In Second 
### Frank Tremaine 
Behind the effective hurling <>f
i Herm Estes, who allowed but two
hits and no runs, Stanford's varsity
; ball-players won their second tilt
from Santa Clara, G to 0, Saturday
| afternoon on the Sunken Diamond,
thereby taking the Bronco series,
| two games to one.
Estes, starting his fir.st game thi.s
i season, turned in a fine exhibition.
IL was not until the fourth inning
that a Santa Claran reached first,
| and only four men got on in the:
| entire game, one going as far as
| second.
Early Lead
Stanford got off to a lead in the?
! second, when three runs crossed
! the plate after two were out. Traut
| man and Irsfeld went down to start
| the inning, but Miles walked and
| advanced to second on Livermorc's
S hit. Manfredi, on the -mound for
I the Broncs, lost his control here and
walked Estes and Maggiora, forcing
! Miles home with the first run. Del
mas' single drove Livermore and
! Estes in a moment later.
Another run came home in the
' fourth when Maggiora walked after
two were out, stole second, and Del
! mas' second hit sent him across the
plate. Woolley's double, which
' opened the fifth inning, paved the
i way for another run. Trautman's
j fly in deep right sent him to third,
! and he scored when Cunningham
i dropped Irsfeld'a short fly in left
| field.
Seventh Good
The seventh brought the Cards'
last counter, when Irsfeld was safe
: as Manfredi threw Trautman out at
! second on his bunt. Irsfeld stole sec
j ond and Livermore drove out a long
' triple to score him.
