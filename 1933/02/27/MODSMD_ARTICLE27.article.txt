# A 						Bottle Serves To Preface an Editorial Ideal
## 
### 
A corked and scaled bottle will flont indefinitely, hut
not forever, that is, unless if he taken from the water and
reeorked occasionally. Such a holllc, (hopped into the
(mil Stream, may hob its way out of the current and drift
aimlessly for years, unless someone sets it hack on its
course.
I he ahove metaphor may, by a generous relaxation of
the normal imaginative process, convey an idea concern
ing the life of a university. An institution of higher learn
ing, founded in the highest ideals of education and with
the best available facilities for the imparting of that edu
cation, may, like the bottle, drift on and on, further and
further from the current into which it was originally
dropped. That is, again, unless somebody picks it up, re
corks it, and sets it hack on its course.
Moving the metaphor one step closer, Stanford may, in
several respects be likened to the drifting bottle. The
setting aright and the "recorking" of the I Diversity, how
ever, is greater than a one-man job. The Daily, admittedly
an authority of a sort in student politics and social life,
Noes not presume itself to he the gallant rescuer of the
Stanford I niversitv lortunes. Neither does it presume that
the student body could accomplish such a task. A genuinely
needed Stanford renaissance, if one is to he effected at all,
must be the result of the concerted effort of the Univer
sity s eternal trinity administration, alumni, and students.
Since the very fact of a university's being points to the
existence of a perpetual student body, it must be true that
Ihe primary factor in the Stanford equation is the indi
vidual student. It is he who will some day he an alumnus,
perhaps an executive of his University. Therefore, if any
new attitude toward Stanford and its educational system
is to evolve, it must he soaked in the opinion of the present
undergraduate and graduate student.
Proceeding on this premise, the present volume of the
Daif.y will address certain random shots at everything in
general, certain editorial comments apparently objectless,
lo its student readers. It will ask questions which even
campus newsmen cannot answer. I his series of occasional
editorials (iocs not have the definite objective of a "cam
paign." Neither does if have the bitterness or sensational
ism of an "attack." Rather, it is in the manner of a serious
and (it is hoped) intelligent bullsession with other students
regarding the present situation at Stanford, '.he Univer
sity s future, and what can he done about it ail.
Perhaps, through the initiating of such considerations,
improvements in Stanford system and spirit will be
realized at some time in the vague future. Perhaps
through such an immediate consideration, at least one
Stanford undergraduate generation will become alumni
or administrators of Ihe University with a slighflv broader
perspective.
Sincere, then, in the belief that Stanford has lagged be
hind its reputation, the Daily thus prefaces ils first-ranking
intention.

Moving the metaphor one step closer, Stanford may, in
several respects be likened to the drifting bottle. The
setting aright and the "recorking" of the I Diversity, how
ever, is greater than a one-man job. The Daily, admittedly
an authority of a sort in student politics and social life,
Noes not presume itself to he the gallant rescuer of the
Stanford I niversitv lortunes. Neither does it presume that
the student body could accomplish such a task. A genuinely
needed Stanford renaissance, if one is to he effected at all,
must be the result of the concerted effort of the Univer
sity s eternal trinity administration, alumni, and students.
Since the very fact of a university's being points to the
existence of a perpetual student body, it must be true that
Ihe primary factor in the Stanford equation is the indi
vidual student. It is he who will some day he an alumnus,
perhaps an executive of his University. Therefore, if any
new attitude toward Stanford and its educational system
is to evolve, it must he soaked in the opinion of the present
undergraduate and graduate student.
Proceeding on this premise, the present volume of the
Daif.y will address certain random shots at everything in
general, certain editorial comments apparently objectless,
lo its student readers. It will ask questions which even
campus newsmen cannot answer. I his series of occasional
editorials (iocs not have the definite objective of a "cam
paign." Neither does if have the bitterness or sensational
ism of an "attack." Rather, it is in the manner of a serious
and (it is hoped) intelligent bullsession with other students
regarding the present situation at Stanford, '.he Univer
sity s future, and what can he done about it ail.
Perhaps, through the initiating of such considerations,
improvements in Stanford system and spirit will be
realized at some time in the vague future. Perhaps
through such an immediate consideration, at least one
Stanford undergraduate generation will become alumni
or administrators of Ihe University with a slighflv broader
perspective.
Sincere, then, in the belief that Stanford has lagged be
hind its reputation, the Daily thus prefaces ils first-ranking
intention.
A corked and scaled bottle will flont indefinitely, hut
not forever, that is, unless if he taken from the water and
reeorked occasionally. Such a holllc, (hopped into the

course.
I he ahove metaphor may, by a generous relaxation of
the normal imaginative process, convey an idea concern

ing, founded in the highest ideals of education and with
the best available facilities for the imparting of that edu
cation, may, like the bottle, drift on and on, further and
further from the current into which it was originally
dropped. That is, again, unless somebody picks it up, re
corks it, and sets it hack on its course.
