Willi ground-breaking ceremonies for the Golden Gale
bridge over and plans for 111 c trans-bay bridge practically
completed, the death knell of the ferry boat begins to toil
dismally over the hay region.
While il will be ;i good live years before the lasl boal
slides into the Ferry Building slip with its flock of sea
gulls in low, a step has been made toward the elimination
of another of S:m Francisco's romantic sights. Long re
garded as one of America's most fascinating cities, San
Francisco is becoming, year by year, more prosaic and
modern.
The wide open saloon and dance hall of Ihc old Bar
bary Coast has been replaced by the up-stairs "speak" and
Ibe night club of North Beach. Ihe old lime romance of

bridge and longest highway bridge will lake its place.
