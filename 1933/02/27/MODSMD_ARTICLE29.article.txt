### ABE MELLINKOFF 
Looking at the Women's Gym'
from a distance, it seems very acces
sible. Even from a nearer approach,
it appears that all that is necessary
is to open the door. But just as
Thermopylae had its Leonidas—the
Gym has its Dr. Bertha Dyment. The
Campus Hosts by patience and di
plomacy manage to storm the sacred
place every now and then. But it's
a battle all the way—every time.
The Daily mentioned that even at
a charity dance, the fee to rent a
piano is five dollars. This, despite -
the fact that the women have pur
chased a piano for the Gym. It
seems almost impossible that the ;
maintenance charge was demanded, j
in advance, from the Relief Com- j
mittee. But the impossible often
happens at the Gym.
From the first audience with Dr.
Dyment when the use of the Gym
is requested—through every stage
of the arrangements — a whole
hearted antagonism is felt. Putting
on a dance at the Gym is a piece of i
diplomatic by-play compared to
which the Congress of Vienna was
a hog-calling contest. At every step
in the negotiations, the Duchess oi
the Gym must be found and per
suaded. Both procedures are diffi
cult.
Why all the red tape and red ink
in running a dance at tlie Gym? In
my opinion, it is not that Dr. Dy
ment is intellectually incapable. On
the contrary—she is a very keen
woman. But she loves the Gym— I
like a child. Every scratch on its new •

' floor and walls is personally painful.
She resents, knowingly or unknow
ingly, and I think knowingly, every
intrusion by the campus.
She would like to see campus
dances moved from the Gym to the
Pavilion—all the time. It would pre
serve the luxurious splendor of the
Gym. In fact, if the Gym classes
were moved out, the splendor might
be preserved even longer—but as
yet that has not been suggested.
Dance chairmen will finally rebel at
' the red tape and, in disgust, leave
the Gym. One already has.
That would be the "big drive" in
the Dyment offensive. That would
be a real win. I cannot believe that
' all this red tape is accidental. I
would not want to beljeve that all
these irritating restrictions- just hap
pen to be. They assume significance
when we realize with what tender
ness Dr. Dyment treasures "her
Gym."
I The Gym is beautiful, but it was
not built, as an architectural monu
ment of the age. It is meant to be
used. The more honest use that
everyone on the campus can get out
of it, the better. It might be well to
have someone other than Dr. Dy
ment placed in charge of loaning its
facilities to campus groups—this
someone being one who would en
joy seeing it used.
S.
The choice is between the sensi
tive feelings of Doctor Dyment,
Duchess of the Gym,' and campus
J dances. I choose the latter.

' floor and walls is personally painful.
She resents, knowingly or unknow
ingly, and I think knowingly, every
intrusion by the campus.
She would like to see campus
dances moved from the Gym to the
Pavilion—all the time. It would pre
serve the luxurious splendor of the
Gym. In fact, if the Gym classes
were moved out, the splendor might
be preserved even longer—but as
yet that has not been suggested.

I The Gym is beautiful, but it was
not built, as an architectural monu

used. The more honest use that
everyone on the campus can get out

have someone other than Dr. Dy

facilities to campus groups—this
someone being one who would en
joy seeing it used.

The choice is between the sensi

Looking at the Women's Gym'
from a distance, it seems very acces
sible. Even from a nearer approach,
it appears that all that is necessary
is to open the door. But just as
Thermopylae had its Leonidas—the
Gym has its Dr. Bertha Dyment. The
Campus Hosts by patience and di
plomacy manage to storm the sacred
place every now and then. But it's
a battle all the way—every time.
The Daily mentioned that even at
a charity dance, the fee to rent a
piano is five dollars. This, despite -
the fact that the women have pur
chased a piano for the Gym. It
seems almost impossible that the ;
maintenance charge was demanded, j
in advance, from the Relief Com- j
mittee. But the impossible often
happens at the Gym.
From the first audience with Dr.
Dyment when the use of the Gym
is requested—through every stage
of the arrangements — a whole
hearted antagonism is felt. Putting
on a dance at the Gym is a piece of i
diplomatic by-play compared to
which the Congress of Vienna was
a hog-calling contest. At every step
in the negotiations, the Duchess oi
the Gym must be found and per
suaded. Both procedures are diffi
cult.
