LOUDER PLEASE (Krasna).—At
the Columbia Theatre.
Movies about press agentry and
artists of ballyhoo have been more
or less the vogue during the past
few months. If, as it is Sc.id, propa
ganda loses its effect when the pub
lic becomes aware of it as propa
ganda, then ballyhoo stunts should
become impotent; for exposes of
dupes of this kind have become nu
merous.
"Louder Please"' is a satire which
reveals the publicity methods of the
mov,ies. It is exaggerated, improb
able, but made possible—because
anything about the pictures is pos
sible.
The first act is slow, almost in
consequential, and certainly devoid
of the humor and excitement which
characterizes the last two acts.
Charles Levison plays the pub

! licity director capably in a nervous,
excitable, cock-sure manner. The
plot involves a daring stunt created
by him for the purpose of publiciz
ing Polly Madison, an actress, also
his fiancee. His fake is detected and
the excitement of the last act begins
with a police investigation by actor
Ralph Freud, done in a smooth and
entertaining fashion.
("Louder Please," produced by the
Theatre League Incorporated, closed
last Saturday evening.)
