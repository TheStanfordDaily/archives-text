In Whic-h Basketball
Lasses Aren't" Condemned

Inspired by the consistently high
class booing and the always hearty
hissing of a multitude of loyal Stan
ford sport fans, the athletic Indian
has ended the 1933 basketball sea
.'.on with three more victories than
pre-season dope credited him as
capable of amassing. Stanford's Con
ference rating includes three wins
ynd eight losses.
Although sarcasm has been
tile form that praise for the
well-dressed Cardinal cagers has
customarily assumed, three
members of the Stanford com
munity have (with the Polly-
Anna optimism of youth)
claimed all season that Stanford
. had a better-tlian-bclieved bas
ketball team, 'lliis trio includes
Coach John Bunt), Manager Don
Cameron, and Scribe Dick
Slrouse.
The Hopeful Three were t >l 1 .set
to win a great moral victory had
Stanford won Saturday, as in that
ease the Indian would have accom
plished a surprisingly good Con
ference showing of four wins, but
Hal Eifert and his Bearish colleagues
were too hot for a Stanford team
handicapped by the loss of Topping
by louls. And now Burnt, Cameron,
and The Scribe must wait for next
year and the eligibility of Addie
Barnett and A1 Hershey; the added
experience of A! Page, Chuck Rog
ers, Palmer Fuller, and Johnny
IViaek; and the possible return to 1
school of Frenchy Lacombe and Biff
Jenkins.
WE MUST SHE!) A
FINAL. SINCERE TEAR
Next year s team, however, will
miss .some mighty good men. Hard
working, popular Captain Tom
Cordry will be gone, and so will
stalwart John Hancock. There will
be no tough, tough Jay Tod to get
the ball olf the backboard, and Payne
Palmer and Chuck Glasgow will
have graduated, too. And Bill
Schnelka, with his sensational early
game shooting, will have left Stan
ford as a regular, after two years'
hard work to get there.
Of course, I, too, could become
sarcastic and deploy the lack of
victories and characterize the
playing of Stanford as lousy and
the players as bums. It would
be an easy thing to do and evi
dence is not lacking. But, after
all. Stanford ALMOST won
three games of the S.C. scries.
But much more important, is the 1
realization that basketball, like all
intercollegiate sports, is theoretically j
at least an amateur activity in which
young men engage for health and <
enjoyment. And 1 am enough of a <
fool to believe that practice should
agree with theory and that very '
little more exercise or enjoyment is i'
obtained by champions than by ;
near-champions.
BUT WE DID CHEER
AS WELL AS 800
There is, however, a correlation 1
between playing hard and the oxer- J
cise and enjoyment obtained from a '
sport, and under these circum
tanccs Stanford had the world's <
finest basketball team. Led by ,
Cordry, a little mite who never \
looked at the scoreboard, Stanford i i
out-tried any and all opponents. )
1 suggest, therefore, that we con- \
-ider the basketball season a lot of i
fun and forget it. After all, the team
gave some occasion to cheer and, j
with the officials, they gave us more j
than sullicient occasion to boo. f

Although sarcasm has been
tile form that praise for the
well-dressed Cardinal cagers has
customarily assumed, three
members of the Stanford com
munity have (with the Polly-
Anna optimism of youth)
claimed all season that Stanford

ketball team, 'lliis trio includes
Coach John Bunt), Manager Don
Cameron, and Scribe Dick
Slrouse.
The Hopeful Three were t >l 1 .set
to win a great moral victory had
Stanford won Saturday, as in that
ease the Indian would have accom
plished a surprisingly good Con
ference showing of four wins, but
Hal Eifert and his Bearish colleagues
were too hot for a Stanford team
handicapped by the loss of Topping
by louls. And now Burnt, Cameron,
and The Scribe must wait for next
year and the eligibility of Addie
Barnett and A1 Hershey; the added
experience of A! Page, Chuck Rog
ers, Palmer Fuller, and Johnny
IViaek; and the possible return to 1
school of Frenchy Lacombe and Biff
Jenkins.
WE MUST SHE!) A
FINAL. SINCERE TEAR
Next year s team, however, will
miss .some mighty good men. Hard
working, popular Captain Tom
Cordry will be gone, and so will
stalwart John Hancock. There will
be no tough, tough Jay Tod to get
the ball olf the backboard, and Payne
Palmer and Chuck Glasgow will
have graduated, too. And Bill
Schnelka, with his sensational early
game shooting, will have left Stan
ford as a regular, after two years'
hard work to get there.
Of course, I, too, could become
sarcastic and deploy the lack of
victories and characterize the
playing of Stanford as lousy and
the players as bums. It would
be an easy thing to do and evi
dence is not lacking. But, after
all. Stanford ALMOST won
three games of the S.C. scries.
But much more important, is the 1
realization that basketball, like all
intercollegiate sports, is theoretically j
at least an amateur activity in which
young men engage for health and <
enjoyment. And 1 am enough of a <
fool to believe that practice should
agree with theory and that very '
little more exercise or enjoyment is i'
obtained by champions than by ;
near-champions.

AS WELL AS 800
There is, however, a correlation 1
