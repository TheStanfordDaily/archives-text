# Junior Golf Men Take Interclass Tournament
## LAWSON LITTLE'S SCORE LOWEST AS FROSH GET SECOND 
### Jay Graves 
A mediocre showing, an aggregate
'"best" out of a bunch of poor golf
scores -won the annual interclass
golfing meet for the Class of '34 last
Saturday.
And if it hadn't been for Law
sen Little's last-minute decision
to play for his class, and his
subsequent low score for the
tournament, the junior bunch
would have lost to a pack of
hlood-hungry freshmen, who,
incidentally, would have won
anyway if two of their number
hadn't cracked and turned in
close-10-ninety scores.
Juniors Gene Brown and Dick
Giddings, both capable of 75 to
77 scores, turned in cards of SO
and 82, respectively. Jack Geer,
last year's state junior college
champion, battered his way over
the course in SI. Wilbert Mcndell
had an 84. Ed Beuter had an 85,
and Lawson Little's 73 completes
the "winning" scores from the
boys on the Class of '34 squad.
Pett Scores 85
Stew Pett, varsity golfer, within ,
the first four on the varsity ladder,
one of the men Coach Eddie Twiggs ;
has been counting on to win against
California next week-end, who |
shoots a regular of 75 to 7G, turned j
in a card that read 85.
The frosh squad, led by en
thusiastic Don Edwards and his
76, had three of the shining spots
of the day. Bob Thompson
cracked through with 7S and
Hugh Mellon turned in another
78.
Total score for the sophs was
492, 1(> points behind the fresh
men, with a score of 538 strokes.
Tom Dwyer turned in a 79, Jack j
Cox an 82, and then—
Bill Hnelle, 79 or 80 man at least,
turned in an 87. Joe Graves turned
in another 87, Art Wright raised the
bid 10 to 97. Bob McAfee looked the
bidding over, and wasn't to be out
done. His score was 106.
Seniors Bring Up Rear
The seniors bid on a grander scale
—in total scores. They eclipsed all i
records, beat the sophomores with
their 97 and 106, split up the high
point man honors, turned in four !
over 90, and rolled up a grand total
of 538, an average of over 91.
