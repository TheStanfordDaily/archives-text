# CARD RUGBY SQUAD NOSES OUT 8-6 WIN OVER PASADENA IN SPEEDY, HEADY GAME
## 
### 
Scrappy Bill Sim scuttled across
the Pasadena goal line for a pair of
| tries Friday and Ernie Caddel
| completed a conversion to go with
one of them. All that accounted for
eight points, just enough to edge
out the Reds by an 8 to 6 score.
The consensus was that "darn
good rugby" was played in the Stan
ford Stadium Friday; both teams
were fast and heady and alert for
the breaks. Pasadena's best bet were
the forwards, but Stanford constant
ly took the ball out of the scrum
and Ben Palamountain's aggressive-
I ness gave the advantage to the home
team in this department.
Pasadena had a slim opportunity
to tie up the score toward the end
of the game after Kenny Sagar had
fought his way over near the side
of the field for a try. Robertson made

a brave attempt for the extra two
points that would tie things up, but
the angle was bad and his kick fell .
short.
Sim scored first for the Stanford
Club by taking the ball out of the
ruck fifteen yards from the Pasa
dena goal and scampering for the
three points. Caddel's attempt a1
conversion failed.
Second period stai'ted with Stan
ford retaining this 3-0 advantage
and after a neat advance by the
Stanford backs, Sim took a pass
from Norm Cleaveland and scored
a second time
