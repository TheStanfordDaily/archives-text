# PAPOOSE CAGEMEN SWEEP U.C. SERIES WITH 26-25 SCORE
## 
### 
Staging one of their now-famous
second-half comebacks, Coach Jim
my Bradshaw's frosh cagers rang up
enough last-minute baskets Satur
day night to nose out the California
Cubs by the slender but sufficient
margin of 26 to 25, thus sweeping
the series with three straight vic
tories.
Eleven points behind at the half,
however, Stanford fortunes looked
none too good until the regulars
tightened up their defense, polished
off their offense, and proceeded to
pull the game out of the fire, as 1
usual.
Cubs Cage Five
A lot of luck enabled the Cali
fornia freshmen to sink five long
shot out of five tries in the first
few minutes of play, while the In-
I dians were chalking up a mere two-
I point total. Luhman and Brooke
were sent in to help stem the tide,
but accomplished little, the half
ending 19 to 8 in favor of the Cubs.
Although several second-string
players were sent in to earn their
numerals at the beginning of the
second half, the Stanford yearlings
succeeded in stopping the Cub scor- 1
ing spree but had little luck with
their own efforts to score. Thinking
his lead safe enough, the California •
. coach sent in his reserves, only to j
have Bradshaw counter by inserting
his first string.
Mannion Score
Before anything could be done
about it, from the California point
of view, Ralph Mannion and Cap
tain Addie Barnett had sunk enough
baskets between them ' to come
through with a one-point advantage
for Stanford. Ken Nobs helped main
tain the lead by having several jump
balls called on him in the closing
minutes of play.
