Scoring in every inning but the
second and sixth, Coach Murray
Cuddeback's freshman nine defeated
the Berkeley High School liorse
hiders 12 to 3 Saturday morning on
the Stanford frosh playing field. The
game, which was called at the end
of the seventh, marked the second
consecutive victory of the wi ek for
the babes, having beaten a team
from Sequoia High 18 to (i last
Thursday.
Superior hitting power and good
pitching enabled the frosh to come
out on top Saturday. Eleven solid
blows were garnered by the year
lings while Frenchesci, the southpaw
lob ball artist, and Treniaine limited
1 the invaders to five bingles. "Chesci"
turned in a fine performance in his
' six innings on the mound, and Tre
maine made short work of his one.
Score in Second Canto
After tallying a trio .of counters in
the opening frame, the babes really
set to work in earnest. Grayson
singled to start the second canto
and promptly stole second. A nice
two-bagger from the big bat of
Monk Moscrip brought in Bobby,
and Monk came in a few moments
later when Marshall socked out a
one-base hit. An infield error on
Pope's grounder allowed Marshall to
cross the platter, and the first-year
men scored four runs in the second
inning.

Two more in the fourth added to
the total, and then came the fifth.
With Morgan and Hamilton on the
s. eks, Bobby Grayson proceeded to
blast out a beautiful homer to left
center, incidentally his second four
base clout of the week.
Three Errors Made
Leading in the slugging depart
ment for the freshmen, along with
Grayson, were Moscrip with a dou
ble and two singles, and Marshall,
who had a perfect day at bat, bag
ging three singles in as many trips
to the plate.
Only three errors were chalked up
against the babes by scorer Fred
Baily, while the Berkeley lads con
tributed four misplays to the day's
festivities.
Cuddeback's starting lineup for
the contest included a battery of
Franchesci, Morgan, Grayson, Gal
braith, Clark, and Marshall in the
infield, and Hamilton, Moscrip, and
Pope patrolling the outer gardens.
