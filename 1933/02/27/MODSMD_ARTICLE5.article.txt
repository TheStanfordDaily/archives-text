Stating the Japanese attitude on
'the Sino-Japanese war, Jenshiro
Tachibana, political science gradu
ate of Stanford, issued this state
ment for publication:
"The present situation in Man
chukuo is more or less a continuance ;
of Japanese policy, i.e., protection of
Japanese interest and subjects. . . .
Jehol is geographically and histori
cally a part of Manchuria. Since i
Manchukuo is but a new country,
Japan has felt the right to protect
her citizens and her railroad, the
latter ceded to Japan after the
Russo-Japanese War. This cession
was obtained with the consultation
of China. Therefore, by internation
al law, Japan is justified in her I
present position.
"While the Manchukuo is very
efficient, Chinese bandits and war
lords pei'sist in coming up from
China as if to attack Manchukuo.
The Manchukuo government feels
itself unsafe. Thus ,in order to pro- '
mote peace in that region, Japan
must oust the Chinese from Jehol;
this is Japan's main purpose in the
present crisis."
Concerning the Japanese with
drawal from the League, Tachibana
said: "Japan's delegates did the best
they could since last September to
make clear the dual Japanese pur
pose of protection of interests and
citizens. Japan is satisfied wiLh her
delegates."
