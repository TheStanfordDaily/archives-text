Led by Kingsbury and Ninnno,
who accounted for ten points each,
the frosh track team opened its sea
son with a (54-58 win over the S.F.U.
freshmen at Stanford Saturday af
ternoon.
Small, dynamic, easy-striding
Nimmo led the milers by well over
100 yards in the speedy time of
4:30.(j. Equally good was his 880 race,
which, though not one of his regular
events, he navigated in 2:0.7, 20
yards in advance of the pack.
Hurdlers Good
Kingsbury, star hurdler, turned in
15.5, and 24.9 second times in the
two hurdle races. His time for the
lows—a half-second better than last
year's Little-Big Meet best—is an
exceptional season opening perform
ance. Klopstoek, his teammate, won
seconds in both races, several yards
to the rear of Kingsbury's flying
feet; Klopstoek also placed second
in a nea rdead-heat 10.4 second 100.
In the weights, clean sweeps were
scored by the frosh. Reynolds, sur
passing his past performance in the
shot, heaved the pellet for a re
markable 44'7." Three feet behind
was Calloway; Leedy came in for
third with 39' G." Leedy, with slightly
under 127 feet, led the discus men.
Bobby Grayson, erstwhile foot
baller and rugger, was dared by
Dink Templeton to race the 220.
Grayson, not a regular trackster, ac
cepted, and turned in a fast 22.9 to
earn second place.
Other Place Winners

the pole vault. E. Jones, leaping
5'9," proved second best high
