# EXPERT CONFIDENT THAT NEED EXISTS FOR FRATERNITIES
## 
### 
"Although your president, Dr.
Wilbur, does not entirely favor fra
ternities at Stanford, he told the In
terfraternity Conference in 1929 that
fraternities must serve a purpose,
or they wouldn't have endured for a
hundred years."
That is the statement made by
Norman Hackett, one of the men in
the inner circle which runs the na
tional fraternities, during his pres
ent visit to the Stanford campus.
Formerly an outstanding figure on
the professional stage, Hackett for
the last three years has been travel
ing secretary for Theta Delta Chi.
He is a delegate to the annual inter
fraternity conference.
Here to Stay
"Fraternities are here to stay,"
said Hackett. "Even in this de
pression they are growing
stronger. They are becoming a
more vital part of the college
each year."
In holding the interest of poten
tial donors among the alumni, the
fraternity has one of its strongest
reasons for existence, Hackett said.
"Take away the fraterntiy,
and you destroy the biggest con
tact with alumni. Some of your
own Stanford graduates have
told me that if fraternities were
banned here, the University
could count them 'out' as far as
any donations were concerned."
Finance Control
Hackett believes that university
control of fraternity finances is im
minent. Ohio State is pioneering in
the movement and has found that
when the financial tangle of the
houses is straightened out the great
est objection to the whole system
has been cleared away.
Two Wisconsin professors recent- !
ly completed three years' research
work by announcing a method to
completely control the apple maggot.
