While bombs burst in Jehol and
the League of Nations sits in Gen
eva, local Chinese look on with tense
interest. In response to a Stanford
Daily inquiry yesterday, Hin Leung,
member of the Palo Alto Chinese
colony, made the following com
ment:
"At the present we are undoubt
edly losing in the trouble with
Japan. But the fighting in Jehol is
raising the morale of the Chinese
people.
"Today, the Chinese are in no
position to meet Japan. They are
handicapped by a lack of ships, air
planes, munitions, and well-drilled
armies. Japan is prepared.
"But because Japan is well-armed,
she has no right to invade China.
She has no more right to come into
Jehol than a foreign power would
have for marching into California.
We let them in peaceably, and now
they come in with their army.
"But we will win in the long run.
This conflict will do China more
good than Japan."
