preferential type of voting system,
tomorrow night, from 7 to 9 o'clock.
Candidates for president are:
Wally Brooke, Ed Butterworth,
Chuck Jonas, John Reisner, Talbot
Shelton, Bud Sophian. Those nomi
nated for vice-president: Ted Al
ford, Tony Cockins, Sid McKeon. The
dance-chairmanship is sought by
Bill Drew, Bob Roth, and George

candidate for smoker chairman.
The preferential system, like that
to be used by the A.S.S.U. in May,
calls for first, second, and third

candidate receives a majority of the
votes, second, and if necessary, third
choices on ballots of losing candi
dates are considered, thus eliminat
ing possibility of a revote.
