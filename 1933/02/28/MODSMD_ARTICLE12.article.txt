# CRARY, BOWMAN TO MAKE DEBUT IN PLAY FRIDAY
## Seat Sale For "Enemy Of People" Opens Today At 1 O'Clock 
### 
Featuring the new top price of $1,
the seat sale for the "Enemy of the
People" begins at 1 o'clock this af
ternoon in the Old Union and at
Keeble's in Palo Alto.
The choice seats on the main
lloor arc to he disposed of at the
$1 figure, with good side seats at
75 cents. Center balcony locations
are also priced at 75 cents. The
usual 50-cent rate for unreserved
side balcony will prevail.
At Friday night's performance,
Stanford theatregoers will see one
of the finest pieces by Hendrik Ib
sen, incorrectly called the father of
the modern drama. It is a brilliant,
challenging, satiric play in which
the playwright holds up to ridicule
small-town government and people.
Quality is likewise applicable to
the cast, which is headed by James
Sandoe, who contributed three ex
cellent performances last year. His
present roleâ€”the sincere, humorous
Dr. Thomas Stockman, medical di
rector of the Municipal Baths, is
rather incompatible with his style
of speaking, but may provide an in
teresting experiment.
New talent appears in Mary Ann
Crary and Fritzi-Beth Bowman,
feminine leads, and Robert Bal
zar, Robert Dwan, Paid Crary, and
Richard Dawson.
Helvenston's production, some
what cut, is designed to accent the
satirical in Ibsen's play, and the re
sult promises to be highly gratify
ing.
