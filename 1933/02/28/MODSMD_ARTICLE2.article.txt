that i nno circumstances would
Great Britain allow herself to he
drawn into the conflict. It was felt

War Orders About E(]ual
It was said unofficially that should
an actual state of war between Chiny
and Japan come about, the Japanese
navy easily would be able to seize
shipments of arms to China and that
it sometime that shipment happened
to be in a British bottom it would
bo difficult to escape involvment.
It is believed that both countries
are about equal in war orders al

to be well stocked with finished ma
terial, and well provided with means
(o finish materials. Her chief need is
raw material.
