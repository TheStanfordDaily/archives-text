# RED CONFESSES TO SETTING OF REICHSTAG FIRE
## Berlin Parliament Building Partially Destroyed In Two-Hour Blaze 
### 
BERLIN, Feb. 27 (JV)—Historic j
Reichstag building, built at a cost 1
of more than $6,000,000, was partly j
destroyed tonight by fire that police j
described as of incendiary origin. I
The blaze was checked after police j
and firemen had battled the flames <
for two hours.
A man who called himself a
Dutch Communist was isaid by i
police to have confessed setting
the fire, which started simultane
ously at three or four points and
within a few minutes enveloped
a large part of the structure in
flames.
Throngs Pack Streets
Every fire engine in Berlin wax j
called to the scene. Police worked
frantically to hold back tremendous j
throngs which packed the streets j
near the building.
No estimate of the damage was !
immediately available, although at!
10:30 p.m., when the whole east I
wing was ablaze and it seemed ap- j
parent that only the west wing j
could be saved, it was said that the .
damage had already amounted to
several million marks.
Party Faces Trouble
Authorities indicated a firm belief j
in an arson theory and it was said !
unofficially that if there is proof
involving the Communists, direct
consequences for the party will ,
follow.
The doorkeeper said the fire j
started simultaneously in three or !
four places—one spot at the j
Reichstag restaurant, and at en- !
trance number four.
Very soon the flames seemed to
engulf .the .whole .building. .The!
stately cupola, in a robe of fire, was j
a picture of ghastly grandeur.
