# "Brother Act” Will Feature U.S.F. Meet Saturday Afternoon
## Blackmans and Eastmans to Compose Stanford Relay Team in Season Opener with Don Trackmen; Eastman Will Not Compete in 440 
### ALBERT GUERARD 
PAIR of already famous Stanford athletic families will gang up on
! San Franeiseo University Saturday afternoon when Stanford's 1933
track and field team opens its season in the Stadium. The Blackmails of
Palo Alio and points east and the Eastmans of Woodside expect to play a
major role in the expected slaughter of San Francisco's track-minded Dons.
First, by virtue of seniority—the Eastmans.
Likened to every speeding object from a Belmont greyhound to Malcolm
! Campbell's 272-milc-an-hour rocket, Captain Ben Eastman defies simile,
metaphor, or alliteration. His assignment for Saturday's meet has not yet
been determined. One thing is certain: Stanford's most-famous athlete will

> not compete in his first love, th<;
440-yard dash. In order to give
sophomore A1 Blackman it fair
chance of winning in his first varsity
meet, the premier Indian trail
blazer will give up, temporarily, the
event in which he has reached in
ternational fame.
