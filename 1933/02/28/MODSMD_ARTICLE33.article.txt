# Blackmans Promise

### 
And now for the hitherto-neglect
ed Blackmans. Brother Al and
Brother Don are both quartermilcrs.
They should divide the places in
Saturday's 440 with Fred Walts ol
San Francisco. Les Wisler, ace San
Francisco sprinter, may also choose
to run. The quartet's best times stack
up as follows:
AI Blackman, 45) flat
Don.Blackman, 50.G (time trial)
Fred Walts, 48.9
Les Wisler, 49.8
Don's 50.G, though the slowest re
corded time of the four, is the most
remarkable. Until late in tin? 1932
season, Blackman the Elder eon
fined his activities to high-jumping,
but he has come along fast in tin:
440 since then. Al's 49 Hat was
turned in as the climax of last year's
Little Big Meet, following closely
on two good performances in the
100- and 220-yard dashes.
Thus Saturday's relay presents (he
fanciful setup of a pair of Stanford
brothers passing ihe unlighted torch
against four biologically unrelated
U.S.F. quarter-milers. And the odds
are favoring Stanford to win not
only the meet, but the all-significant
relay.
