# Campus Awaits Whitewash On Darkly Painted Women's Gym

Willi Hie Women's (iyni recently |»; iin 11 >< I in dark shades
Ijv 11 m* 1) ru s h wielders of lliis column and llio Hull Session,
the campus is no doubl awaiting some sorl of reply from
the doctor in charge of llial focal point. Questions have
been asked and insinuations made regarding the altitude
which the Women's <iyni administration has taken toward
the Student llelief I'iind. The <|uery of "wliv must the
Women's (ivm charge a rental fee for the dance studio and
for an ordinary upright piano at a Student Relief dance?"
has so far gone unanswered.
If the Women's (iyni can justify its position with re
gard to the Relief Fund, the campus would no doubt be
very pleased to read it in the Campus Opinion column.
Perhaps, after all, there arc valid reasons why the gym
cannot afford to furnish ils facilities for these depression
dances, why a Women's (iyni piano is more valuable than
just any old piano.
Meanwhile another of the gym's original "justifications"
fur charging Hie Relief Committee rental fees has been
thoroughly sliol to pieces. The fifteen dollars which was
said to be necessary to pay "lighting, healing, janitors,
etc.' gels no closer to (he janitors' pockets than it does to
the Relief Fund. The janitors, it appears, lake their duties
of opening, cleaning, and eventually locking the building,
ifs a matter of course. The long-suffering gentlemen of the
pan and push-broom perform their duties about the
Women's (iyni under the impression llial such labor is
merely a pari of their regular duties around the t nivcr
sity, which is a pretty rational idea, since they never re
ceive additional pay checks following Relief Fund dances.
