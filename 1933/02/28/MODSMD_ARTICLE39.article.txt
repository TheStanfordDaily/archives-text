"League of Nations Condemns .lap Policy" "Tokyo
Delegates Quit Geneva" "Nippon Troops Pour info .Ichol."
More clearly than years of debate do these recent head
lines demonstrate (hat the League of Nations as constituted
today is guilty of serious weaknesses, it seems undeniable
that there is something kicking in the manner in which the
present Manchurian crisis is heing treated bv the Geneva
authorities.
Perhaps there is ;i Haw somewhere in the League's
administrative make-up. Last year's Shanghai episode was
inefficiently handled. Xo better is this year's Manchukuo
"pacification." t ndoubtedly the League's Oriental depart
ment needs ;i thorough reorganization, under new manage
ment.
Those ancient stand-bys of League proponents, the
Aland Islands, seem now to be outranked by Jehol in de
bates at least in size.
Perhaps the gentlemen assembled in Geneva will yet
line! some honorable and creditable way out of the war
clouds that bang over the mud-walled towns of barren
Manchukuo. It is to be hoped so. The world looks to them,
those frock-coated gentlemen, to find the way out before
the clouds spread west and north and east.
