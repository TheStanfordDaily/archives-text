## MUD IN YOUR EYE 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
Everybody is hopeless. Some peo
ple are hopeless idealists. The rest
are hopeless realists. The former
walk with their heads so far up in
the sky they soon develop water
on-the-brain. The latter are so eager
to keep both feet on the ground that
they bury their faces in the mud. A
journalist is supposed to be a real
ist.
Chester Rowell is an idealist
writing for a newspaper. One can
not go so far as to say Rowell has
developed water-on-the-brain in
regards to the Oriental situation.
But he seems to have at least fogged
up his spectacles; for while he dis
cusses the possible results IF war
breaks out over there, the Chronicle
relates of city-bombings and mass
killings along the battlefront.
There may not be a war going on
across the Pacific, but the substitute
is most perfect. So perfect, that no
one but an idealist like Rowell can
detect the difference. There has been
no formal declaration but aside from
that ,nothing has been spared. Ac
cording to all reports, it's a real
show—the action being a little slow
when judged by Western standards
but deadly enough to kill anyone,
Oriental or Occidental. No one wants
to declare war over (here but every
one is warring. Whoever declares
first is going to be it—that is the
aggressor. And neither wants the
title. So there is a nice blowing up
of each other—and both ar<? merely
establishing order out of chaos.
But the League of Nations is sup
posed to prevent war—(it can be
found in one of the many articles of

the League Covenant I feel sure).
So idealist Rowell refuses to see
war in the bombing of cities and
the killing of thousands. Maybe it is
only a game of run-sheep-run.
If we once admit war in the
Orient, we are admitting the perfect
impotency of the League to stop
war —which has long been a preva
lent suspicion. So Chester Rowell
hides himself deep within the folds
of the paper-machinery of interna
tional harmony and solemnly speaks
of "when war comes."
But if Mr. Rowell were to pick up
his typewriter and let it fall upon
J my head, I feel confident at this
moment that it would be unneces
sary for him to tell me that a foreign
body had struck me. Without formal
proclamation on his part, I could
presume what had happened in a
general sort of way at least. China
knows she is at war. So does Japan.
But Columnist Rowell does not. Who
is mistaken?
As for Japan's right Jo jump on
China, it all depends on your view
point. If England has a right to jump
on India —France on Syria—and the
i United States on the Caribbean
countries generally—then a rousing
hip-hip-hooray for the Japanese.
! They are jumping in championship
| style. They may be jumping so far,
however, that not unlike 80-Peep's
sheep, they will come back—drag
l ging them in the mud behind them.
If you happen to believe in inter
national justice and that prolific cir
culator of musty pamphlets, the
League of Nations, your sympathy is
! with him who gets jumped—China
I in this case.

presume what had happened in a
general sort of way at least. China
knows she is at war. So does Japan.
But Columnist Rowell does not. Who
is mistaken?
As for Japan's right Jo jump on
China, it all depends on your view
point. If England has a right to jump
on India —France on Syria—and the
i United States on the Caribbean
countries generally—then a rousing
hip-hip-hooray for the Japanese.
! They are jumping in championship
| style. They may be jumping so far,
however, that not unlike 80-Peep's
sheep, they will come back—drag
l ging them in the mud behind them.
If you happen to believe in inter
national justice and that prolific cir
culator of musty pamphlets, the
League of Nations, your sympathy is

I in this case.
Everybody is hopeless. Some peo
ple are hopeless idealists. The rest
are hopeless realists. The former
walk with their heads so far up in
the sky they soon develop water
on-the-brain. The latter are so eager
to keep both feet on the ground that
they bury their faces in the mud. A
journalist is supposed to be a real
ist.
Chester Rowell is an idealist
writing for a newspaper. One can
not go so far as to say Rowell has
developed water-on-the-brain in
regards to the Oriental situation.
But he seems to have at least fogged
up his spectacles; for while he dis
cusses the possible results IF war
breaks out over there, the Chronicle
relates of city-bombings and mass
killings along the battlefront.
There may not be a war going on
across the Pacific, but the substitute
is most perfect. So perfect, that no
one but an idealist like Rowell can
detect the difference. There has been
no formal declaration but aside from
that ,nothing has been spared. Ac
cording to all reports, it's a real
show—the action being a little slow
when judged by Western standards
but deadly enough to kill anyone,
Oriental or Occidental. No one wants
to declare war over (here but every
one is warring. Whoever declares
first is going to be it—that is the
aggressor. And neither wants the
title. So there is a nice blowing up
of each other—and both ar<? merely
establishing order out of chaos.
But the League of Nations is sup
posed to prevent war—(it can be
found in one of the many articles of

the League Covenant I feel sure).
So idealist Rowell refuses to see
war in the bombing of cities and
the killing of thousands. Maybe it is
only a game of run-sheep-run.
If we once admit war in the
Orient, we are admitting the perfect
impotency of the League to stop
war —which has long been a preva
lent suspicion. So Chester Rowell
hides himself deep within the folds
of the paper-machinery of interna
tional harmony and solemnly speaks
of "when war comes."
But if Mr. Rowell were to pick up
his typewriter and let it fall upon
J my head, I feel confident at this
moment that it would be unneces
sary for him to tell me that a foreign
body had struck me. Without formal
proclamation on his part, I could
presume what had happened in a
general sort of way at least. China
knows she is at war. So does Japan.
