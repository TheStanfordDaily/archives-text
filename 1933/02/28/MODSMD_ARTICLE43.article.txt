THE SIGN OF THE CROSS (Para- !
mount) —At the Stanford Theatre.
Played with as few clothes and as | '•
much architecture as possible "The |
Sign of the Cross" is the latest ex- >:
ample of Hollywood sensationalism ;
disguised under a thin veneer of
religion. Although all the Christians!
speak in Bible phrases and all the
pagans speak modern English, in- !:
congruous in a Roman arena, the
film is still good old Cecil DoMille
technique, even to Poppaiea's milk
buth. All the Christians are simple
to the point of barbarism. Christian
persecution is intensified and pro
longed to a painful length and de
gree. One cannot help being im
pressed by an endless succession of
Christians impaled on spears, Chris
tians clutching at arrows through
their necks, Christian youths being
masticated by elephants and lions,
Christian virgins being pawed by I
apes; in the end, it becomes torture
for the audience, too.
Charles Laughton, with limited |
opportunities, makes of Nero a fa
tuous blob of fat with a putty nose, j
Claudette Colbert enjoys to the ut- j
most her role of ihe wily Poppaiea.
Elissa Landi suffers. Fredric March
looks handsome. Joyzelle contributes
a standard Roman orgy. —Brauns j
CRIMINAL-AT-LARGE (Wallace)
—At the Alcazar Theatre.
A mystery play which in itself is j
fascinatingly full of both suspense
and humor, "Criminal-at-Large" is
overshadowed by the acting of Paul- j
ine Frederick. As Lady Lebanon, j
Miss Frederick has an opportunity j
to glide about the stage in flowing
black gowns, accentuating to per- J
lection her distinguished bearing and
rather mysterious appeal. She plays
her part with just the right mixture '
of aloof hauteur and hopeless, hunt
ed despair. It is a striking perform
ance.
Crane Wilbur, as Chief Detective
Inspector Tanner, was excellent; but I;

it seemed to me that the laurels
among the men should go to Donald
Stuart for his acting of the comedy
role of Sergeant Trotty, seemingly
so necessary to mystery plays. The
audience showed obvious apprecia
tion of his interpretation of the part;
he never missed an opportunity to
attract laughs and yet was never
guilty of over-acting.
The nerve-wracked, hysterical !
Isla, a pawn in the hands of Lady 1
Lebanon in the latter's attempt to j
carry on her ancient and .tottering j
family, was quite effectively done I
by charming Kay Hammond. Dwight.
Frye, young Lord Lebanon, was fine
in the last scene of the play, which
also showed Crane Wilbur at his
best. —Riceiardi
