An Interesting Tale
Of Falsification
Dink Templeton, the most famous
product of the Stanford School of
Journalism, is in the uncomfortable
predicament of a man whose avoca
tion is threatening to eclipse his vo
cation.
Mr. Templeton, it will be re
membered, is the Stanford track
coach as well as a luminary
among Bay Region sports writ
ers. And although it is not my
business to mind Mr. Temple
ton's business, and although Mr.
Templeton is abundantly profi
cient as both a sports writer and
as track coach, I shall dare to
state (hat Mr. Templeton's voca
tion is coaching track and his
avocation is writing sports. This
conclusion may be fallacious,
but after all Mr. Templeton is an
employee of the Hoard of Ath
letic Control and therefore it is
reasonable to assume that bis
salary is paid for his excellence
as a track coach.
Of course, Mr. Templeton is also
paid a salary of a kind by the news
paper that employs him, but this is
considered a subsidiary or by-prod
uct salary. Mr. Templeton himself,
being paradoxically both honest and
an instructor of young men in the
arts of running and jumping and
throwing, realizes this and is con
siderably perturbed by the increas
ing demand for his services as a
sports writer.
DINK'S COLOR-PREFERENCE
CHANGES FROM YELLOW
TO (iREEN
Mr. Templeton recently trans
ferred his journalistic allegiance
from a yellow city paper to a city
paper with a green sheet, and with
the exuberance created by a
new outlet, Dink toured up to San
Francisco to enjoy and to report the
recent Corbctt-Fii Ids box-light. Al
ter enjoying the box-light, Mr.
Templeton wrote a neat but not
gaudy story for the green paper, and
retired to his campus sanctuary.
Therefore much surprise exer
cised the Templeton sanctuary
when the yellow paper appeared
with a slangy, carefree story of
the box-fight under the bold
face, capitalized by-line "By
DINK TEMPLETON." And since
Dink's authentic article had al
ready been printed in the green
paper, the sports-writing gen
tlemen threatened to ostracize
Mr. Templeton as being a usurp
er of newspaper space in these
days of depression.
The double entry was not the
fault of Mr. Templeton, and Dink
has sought the sympathy and ad
vice of the best lawyer in San, Fra
ncisco. Mr. Templeton was riled by
the incident, but mainly because of
the character of the story.
HURRAY FOR CORBETT!
lIOTCIIA, lIOTCHA!
The lead falsely credited to Mr.
Templeton read: "I am glad to see
the kid win the title. From the many
associations I have had with Young
Corbett 111, through my connections
with sports, I am happy to see such
an athlete as Corbett win the world's
welterweight title."
Such a story is clearly a case
for libel if not for assault and
battery, and I for one sympa
thize with Mr. Templeton as I
have written similar tripe my
self and have been forced to see
my by-line over it the next
morning. And Dink didn't even
write the tripe himself.
1 am of course always interested
in the welfare of Stanford Univer
sity, and I therefore feel that such
libelous action should stop. The
Board of Athletic Control might
write a kind but firm letter to the
yellow sheet, reminding them that
Mr. Templeton is receiving a salary
from Stanford University and that
therefore Stanford University is en
titled to first claim on Mr. Temple
ton's services. For such an article
I- Meets upon the writing ability of
Stanford journalists. As Dink said,
"I wouldn't have minded if the stuff
had been well-written, but 'I'm glad
to see the kid win the title.' Oh
Lord." —Dick Strouse

business to mind Mr. Temple
ton's business, and although Mr.
Templeton is abundantly profi
cient as both a sports writer and
as track coach, I shall dare to
state (hat Mr. Templeton's voca
tion is coaching track and his
avocation is writing sports. This
conclusion may be fallacious,
but after all Mr. Templeton is an
employee of the Hoard of Ath
letic Control and therefore it is
reasonable to assume that bis
salary is paid for his excellence
as a track coach.
Of course, Mr. Templeton is also
paid a salary of a kind by the news
paper that employs him, but this is
considered a subsidiary or by-prod
uct salary. Mr. Templeton himself,
being paradoxically both honest and
an instructor of young men in the

throwing, realizes this and is con
siderably perturbed by the increas
ing demand for his services as a
sports writer.
DINK'S COLOR-PREFERENCE
CHANGES FROM YELLOW
TO (iREEN
Mr. Templeton recently trans
ferred his journalistic allegiance
from a yellow city paper to a city
paper with a green sheet, and with
the exuberance created by a
new outlet, Dink toured up to San
Francisco to enjoy and to report the
recent Corbctt-Fii Ids box-light. Al
ter enjoying the box-light, Mr.
Templeton wrote a neat but not
gaudy story for the green paper, and
retired to his campus sanctuary.
Therefore much surprise exer
cised the Templeton sanctuary
when the yellow paper appeared
with a slangy, carefree story of
the box-fight under the bold
face, capitalized by-line "By
DINK TEMPLETON." And since
Dink's authentic article had al
ready been printed in the green
paper, the sports-writing gen
tlemen threatened to ostracize
Mr. Templeton as being a usurp
er of newspaper space in these
days of depression.
The double entry was not the
fault of Mr. Templeton, and Dink
has sought the sympathy and ad
vice of the best lawyer in San, Fra
ncisco. Mr. Templeton was riled by
the incident, but mainly because of
the character of the story.
HURRAY FOR CORBETT!
lIOTCIIA, lIOTCHA!
The lead falsely credited to Mr.
Templeton read: "I am glad to see
the kid win the title. From the many
associations I have had with Young
Corbett 111, through my connections
with sports, I am happy to see such
an athlete as Corbett win the world's
welterweight title."
Such a story is clearly a case
for libel if not for assault and
battery, and I for one sympa
thize with Mr. Templeton as I
have written similar tripe my
self and have been forced to see
my by-line over it the next
morning. And Dink didn't even
write the tripe himself.
1 am of course always interested
in the welfare of Stanford Univer
sity, and I therefore feel that such
libelous action should stop. The
Board of Athletic Control might
write a kind but firm letter to the
yellow sheet, reminding them that
Mr. Templeton is receiving a salary
from Stanford University and that
therefore Stanford University is en
titled to first claim on Mr. Temple
ton's services. For such an article
I- Meets upon the writing ability of
Stanford journalists. As Dink said,
"I wouldn't have minded if the stuff
had been well-written, but 'I'm glad
to see the kid win the title.' Oh
Lord." —Dick Strouse
An Interesting Tale
