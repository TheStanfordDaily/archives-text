# VARSITY FAVORED OVER REAR SQUAD IN GOLF TOURNEY
## 
### Jay Graves 
When the Cardinal stick-swingers
meet California's "dark horse" golf
squads next Friday in their annual
club tournament, Lawson Little,
star golfer, will lead the Stanfordites
to victory, hopes Eddie Twiggs, golf
coach.
Harry Eichelberger, senior main
stay of the team, Dick Giddings
from Modesto Junior College, Tom
Dwyor. Gene Brown, and Jack
Gccr, last year's state junior col
lege champ, will complete the
Stanford varsity squad.
Don Edwards, the enthusiastic,
will lead the yearlings against the
Cubs from Berkeley. With him will
be Bob Thompson, Hugh Mellon, Ed
Littlefield, Bud Nicholas, and Roger
Pearson.
The varsity boys should be able
to win their match handily, Twiggs
thinks, but by that he doesn't mean
that he is expecting anything, ;hat
even looks like a walk-away. After
the poor showing the boys were
guilty of last week-end in the inter
class, Eddie says he is considering
giving an auxiliary course in "Math
ematics for Golfers''—just as a
means of impressing the fact that it
is the low score and not the high
score which wins.
They are capable of shooting
good golf, Twiggs maintains, but
they will have to settle down and
get their minds in the game and
fight from the first point to the last
if they expect to win this year's
golf classic.
As for the frosh, Twiggs thinks
they are in a better position than
the varsity, and are far ahead of
last year's frosh squad. The babes
are in the same spot that last year's
varsity found themselves in. And
(recalling that defeat) Twiggs hopes
that they don't duplicate that per
formance. Eddie isn't sure as to just
how good that Bear bunch is.
He had counted on the interclass
to give hi in a lead on how to play
the boys in the California matches.
