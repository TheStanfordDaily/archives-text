# PAN-HELLENIC TO REVISE RULINGS
## Rushing May Begin In Fall After Thanksgiving 
### 
If the suggestions made yesterday
j by the Pan-hellenic committee on
i recommendations for changes in
! rushing rules are accepted by the
| joint meeting of new and old officers
! spring quarter, the system will be
I drastically revised.
Rushing will start fall quarter
j with four days of lunch and dinner
i dates. This period of rushing will
! take place the week following
! Thanksgiving and will replace fall
I quarter teas. The freshmen will be
I allowed to accept only one date with
i each house just as in the old system.
Second period will consist of six
j days of dates ending with pledging
ion Frida / if it can be arranged,
i New won |n entering winter quarter
! will be e itertained previously mI a
j Pan-helh-iic tea at which four wo
i men from each of the sororities will
■ be present.
In order to eliminate the great
, confusion involved in telephoning
■ replies to invitations, a card system
|is to be established whereby the
j sorority sends three possible dates
J arranged in order of preference ,to
! the freshman who the date
i accepted and pla' .s the card in a
j box provided in Roble. The sponsors
i will then sort fhe replies and take
| them to the various houses, thus
j eliminating the possibility of any
I losses in the post office.
I Other changes were eliminations, \
| technicalities, and minor substitu-
I tions.
