# STANFORD RUGGER SQUAD PLAYS U.C. FIFTEEN SATURDAY
## 
### 
After winning a close struggle
from the Pasadena Reds, admitted
to be the best of the southern Cali
fornia rugby teams, Stanford levels
the sights of their rugby big guns
on the large looming hide of the
California Bear Saturday.
Originally scheduled for Ewing
field in San Francisco, it was dis
closed yesterday by Harry Maloney,
official of the Northern California
Rugby Union, that the game may be
played in Stanford Stadium. Plans
;.re afoot to bring the contest to the
home grounds of either of the com
petitors.
If the game is played at Ewing
field, it will be the first time since
1904 1 hit Stanford and California
have met at rugby in San Francisco,
and the rugby union intends to
make something of an occasion of
the meeting. President Sproul of
California and Acting-President
Swain of Stanford will be in the
stands as guests of the union. Mayor
Rossi of San Francisco may be pre
vailed upon to kick off.
Stanford should be favored over
the Blue and Gold in view of their
experience. By taking Pasadena
down in a close game Friday the
Cards have achieved a state-wide
reputation, and as yet California has
done nothing startling.
