# Cardinals Tie U.C. Nine In P.C.C. Baseball Race
## 
### 
Stanford and California stand in
a tie for first place in the Intercolle
giate Baseball Association pennant
race with one victory apiece as a
result of the Bears' win over St.
Mary's, G to 2, last Saturday.
Stanford had previously beaten
the Gaels 19 to 0 while U.S.C. has
.vet to play a conference game. Due
to lack of finances, U.C.L.A., Santa-
Clara, and San Francisco University
have dropped out of the league this
season, making the race a four
cornered one.
After their overwhelming victory
over the Moragans last week, the
Indians were established with U.S.C.
as favorites for the conference
crown.
