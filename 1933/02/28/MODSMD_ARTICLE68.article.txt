# BASSETT TO READ JOHN MASEFIELD'S DIALECT TONIGHT
## 
### Frank Moore 
Vividness and reality are given to
poetry through careful study and
sympathy for the poet. These quali
ties will be given to the works of
John Masefield by Professor L. E.
Bassett tonight when he gives read
ings from the English Poet Laureate
in the Little Theatre at 7:30 o'clock,
tonight.
Professor Bassett, head of the
English department's division of
public speaking, is liked for his
sincere presentation of verse. His
naturalness in reading has come
as a fresh note to many audiences
accustomed to a highly artificial
elocution.
At Oxford, where he was a mem
ber of the Union, tonight's speaker
studied Masefield in circles where
the poet's works are intimately
known,
Reads Dialect
Professor Bassett will read some
of Masefield's dialect verse and fin
est lyrics. Included will be parts of
"Dauber" and of "Reynard the Fox."
The former is a tale of the sea and
has been described as "the most
graphic description of the sea ever
written in verse." The latter poem
is a vivid, moving narrative of an
English fox hunt.
Comments upon the poems and
their author will be given by way
of introduction to the readings.
Poet Laureate in 1930
Masefield became a prominent
figure in the world press when he
was made Poet Laureate of England
in 1930. He is also noted as a novel
ist, dramatist, literary critic, and
lecturer. At present he is vacation
ing in the United States.
Local history is barren upon the
details, but Masefield was on the
the Stanford campus in 1918. He
spoke at the army training post,
Camp Freemont, which was then
flourishing in the vicinity of
Menlo Park.
Professor Bassett will briefly tell
of the poet's early life, which was
one of hard experience.
A wind tunnel similar to those
used in testing airplanes, has been
installed at Pittsburgh, Pa., to test
streamlined locomotives and street
cars.
