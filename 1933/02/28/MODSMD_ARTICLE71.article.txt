# Founder's Day Program Fixed
## 
### 
Announcements of the Founders'
Day commemoration program in the
Memorial Church on the evening of
Thursday, March 9, were sent out
by the Public Exercises Committee
yesterday.
The program this year will be
more distinctively a University
affair than it has been in some
recent years, consisting of sacred
music by Stanford organizations,
assisted by the Mills College choir
and the Morris C'luh of I'alo Alto,
and a brief address by Lcland W.
Cutler, Stanford graduate and
president of the University Board
of Trustees.
Admission will be without tickets
and friends of the University will be
welcome to the capacity of the
Church. There will be reserved seats
only for emeritus professors and
other dignitaries and the members
of the senior class.
