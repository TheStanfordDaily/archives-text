# Stanford Students Visit Santa Barbara Law Firm
## 
### 
The class in office practice of the
Stanford School of Law has just
returned from an inspection tour of
the law offices of the Santa Barbara
firm of Heancy, Price and Postel.
The student lawyers, led by Pro
fessor James E. Brenner, went
through each department of the ad
ministrative offices of the firm and
heard lectures by each department
head.
The group of about 20 students
went to Santa Barabara Friday night
and returned late Saturday night
and Sunday morning.
