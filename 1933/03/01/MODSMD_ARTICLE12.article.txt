# HINDENBURG'S EDICT SMASHES REDS IN BERLIN
## New Decree Nears Martial Law As Death Penalty Widely Extended 
### 
BERLIN, Feb. 28 â€”A hefty
blow was struck at communism in
Germany by a decree President
I von Ilindenburg signed tonight
placing the nation under virtual
martial law "to protect the people
from communist danger."
The decree was approved at a
Cabinet meeting at which Wilhclm
Goering, Minister without portfolio
and commissioner for the Prussian
Ministry of Interior, reported to his
j colleagues on the incendiary fire
j which damaged the Reichstag last
1 night and on the recent raid on Karl
I Liebknecht house, the communist
headquarters in Berlin.
Not Martial Law
The emergency measures taken by
the government to cope with the
! situation fell short of martial law
I only because of the desire to keep
! the army out of politics.
Extraordinary powers to safe
! guard against disorder were placed
1 in the hands of police.
Meanwhile Communist leaders
throughout Germany were placed
j under arrest. The arrest order af
| fected Communist members of the
I Reichstag, but it was impossible to
! determine how many of them had
| been sized as many went into hiding.
Plot Water Poisoning
Captain Goering reported that in
! Karl Leibknecht's house the raiders
| found forged orders to the police
] and to National Socialist storm
| troopers, as well as instructions for
poisoning wells and food.
The decree declaring a state of
j emergency contained seven clauses.
One of them inflicts the death
penalty (hitherto life imprison
j incnt) for high treason, poisoning,
j arson, explosives, flooding or dam
! aging the railways.
