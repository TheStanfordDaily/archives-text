# Stover Does Four Sets For 'Enemy of the People'
## 
### ELIZABETH CHAPIN 
Faced with an elaborate set-prob- '
J lem for "An Enemy of the People,"
I Frederick Stover has turned out
! four unit sets which are designed to
; give an effective backing to the
great Ibsen tragi-comedy which will
be presented Friday night at 8:30
o'clock in the Assembly Hall.
This is the first play in some time
for which Stover has had to design
more than three sets. ''The Hairy I
j Ape" required seven stylized sets
which were less realistic that those
for the current play.
Acts I and II are laid in the home
of Dr. Thomas Stockmann in a Nor
wegian town of the '90's. In this set
! one of the designer's greatest prob
lems was a large Continental stove
which serves to establish the locale
I of the drama.
The thfrd net is in (he editorial :

' office of "The People's Messenger,"
the publication which voices the
opinion of the majority, which Ib
sen derides.
The deepest and most significant
set of the group is that for Act IV.
which takes place in a large room
of Captain Horster's house, where
i Stockmann pleads his case before a
town meeting.
The final act, Dr. Stockmann's
j study, like all the rest, is not fully
realistic, but rather the atmosphere
of realism is suggested by the props
and the absence of ceiling, with only
black "teasers" at the top. A neutral
coloring is retained throughout, iti
keeping with the mood of Ibsen's
play.
The sets are not the only problem
of the technical director, but, says
Stover, "this time there are no off
stage noises, thank God."
