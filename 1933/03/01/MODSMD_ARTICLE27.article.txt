Encina Club elections, held last
night under the new preferential

balloting. "Chuck" Jonas, by virtue
of the second choices count, emerged
from the field of six as president, by
a scant margin over Johnny RaLsner.
Tony Cockins, on count of third
choices on the ballojs, became vice
president over Sid McKeon, also by
a slim difference. Dance-chairman,
the third contested post, was cinched
by Bill Drew in the second choice
