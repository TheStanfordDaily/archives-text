# INDIAN DIAMOND SQUAD INVADES MORAGA TODAY
## Gaels Improved Since Last Stanford Tlit; Beaten By Bears, 6-2 BATTERIES UNCERTAIN Victory Will Give Cardinals Conference Lead 
### Frank Tremaine 
Hoping for a second league victory
in as many starts, Stanford's varsity
ball players invade Moraga this af
ternoon for their second game
against St. Mary's.
After the 19 to 0 drubbing ad
ministered the Gaels last Wednes
day by the Indians, Stanford is fa
vored to take the second tilt al
though St. Mary's showed vast im
provement in their game against a
strong California team Saturday.
The Moragans lost G to 2, but almost
pulled the game out of the (ire in
the ninth inning when they loaded
the bases with no outs only to go
(jut in order without scoring.
Pitchcr Undecided
Either Harry Stark, who gave
Stanford its first victory over Santa
Clara, or Fred Herringer, the big
sophomore who blanked the Gaels
last week, will be Coach Harry Win
ter's starting choice on the mound.
Captain Ike Livermore or Jim Mas
sey will complete the battery.
St. Mary's was handicapped in
its first game against the Cards by
an obvious lack of practice and the
face that not all of their players had
been able to get in shape after bas
ketball. However, their showing
against the Bears was a great im
provement and tomorrow's game
should be much closer.
Caviglia may get the opening
pitching assignment for the Gaels
provided he has been able to get
into condition following his hoop
campaign. If not, Flynn, Atti, Mc-
Kay, Gerardin, or Stetson will get
the call with Barreilles or Bonnelli
behind the plate.
Dclmas Batting 1.000
Burt Delmas led the bombard
ment against the Moraga hurlers
last week with a perfect day at bat,
collecting five hits, and will attempt
to keep his league batting average
at 1.000 today. Delmas has proven
the most consistent hitter to date,
with Maggiora, Trautman, Miles, and
Livermore right behind.
Wolter will probably opc.j with
the same line-up tomorrow as in
previous games. Maggiora in center
field will top the batting order fol
lowed by Delmas, shot; Mallntratt,
first base; Woolley, second; Traut
man, third; Irsfeld, left; Miles, right;
Livermore, or Massey, catcher; and
Stark or Heringer, pitcher.
A victory tomorrow will put Stan
ford at the top of the league stand
ings with two wins. California's de
feat of St. Mary's Saturday leaves
the Bears and Cards tied at present
with St. Mary's at the bottom of the
league. U.S.C. has yet to play a con
ference game but looks particularly
strong with a veteran aggregation
which has shown up well in game;
against Southern California semi
pro teams.

sophomore who blanked the Gaels
last week, will be Coach Harry Win
ter's starting choice on the mound.
Captain Ike Livermore or Jim Mas
sey will complete the battery.
St. Mary's was handicapped in
its first game against the Cards by
an obvious lack of practice and the
face that not all of their players had
been able to get in shape after bas
ketball. However, their showing
against the Bears was a great im
provement and tomorrow's game
should be much closer.
Caviglia may get the opening
pitching assignment for the Gaels
provided he has been able to get
into condition following his hoop
campaign. If not, Flynn, Atti, Mc-
Kay, Gerardin, or Stetson will get
the call with Barreilles or Bonnelli
behind the plate.
Dclmas Batting 1.000
Burt Delmas led the bombard
ment against the Moraga hurlers
last week with a perfect day at bat,
collecting five hits, and will attempt
to keep his league batting average
at 1.000 today. Delmas has proven
the most consistent hitter to date,
with Maggiora, Trautman, Miles, and
Livermore right behind.
Wolter will probably opc.j with
the same line-up tomorrow as in
previous games. Maggiora in center
field will top the batting order fol
lowed by Delmas, shot; Mallntratt,
first base; Woolley, second; Traut
man, third; Irsfeld, left; Miles, right;
Livermore, or Massey, catcher; and
Stark or Heringer, pitcher.
A victory tomorrow will put Stan
ford at the top of the league stand
ings with two wins. California's de
feat of St. Mary's Saturday leaves
the Bears and Cards tied at present
with St. Mary's at the bottom of the
league. U.S.C. has yet to play a con
ference game but looks particularly
strong with a veteran aggregation
which has shown up well in game;
against Southern California semi
pro teams.
Hoping for a second league victory
in as many starts, Stanford's varsity
ball players invade Moraga this af
ternoon for their second game
against St. Mary's.
After the 19 to 0 drubbing ad
ministered the Gaels last Wednes
day by the Indians, Stanford is fa
vored to take the second tilt al
though St. Mary's showed vast im
provement in their game against a
strong California team Saturday.
The Moragans lost G to 2, but almost
pulled the game out of the (ire in
the ninth inning when they loaded
the bases with no outs only to go
(jut in order without scoring.
Pitchcr Undecided
Either Harry Stark, who gave
Stanford its first victory over Santa
Clara, or Fred Herringer, the big
sophomore who blanked the Gaels
last week, will be Coach Harry Win
ter's starting choice on the mound.
