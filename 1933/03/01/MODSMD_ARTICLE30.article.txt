# Sorority Women Await A New Deal, In Rushing Cards
## 
### 
This week's Pan-Hellenic report on suggested rushing
rule revisions showed amazing signs of intelligence. The
recommended changes bore imprints of the hammering of
ridiculing student journalists of a recent vintage. Now, if
only a severe frost does not strike the minds of Pan-Hellenic
members, prospects are very good for a new crop of more
sensible, more practicable women's rushing rules next year.
Certain il is that Ihe old and new members of the she-
Greeks' assembly cannot fail to recognize the value of the
proposed changes. If Ihe members of thai assembly carry
with lliein to their meeting next quarter the memories of
past hectic rushing seasons, of Ihis year's absurd code of
rules, they will inevitably distinguish iheniselves by grind
ing out some "progressive" legislation.
Noteworthy among Ihe proposed revisions is one which
will make il possible for the Pan-Hellenic body lo further
revise its rules at any time. During Ihe most recent women's
rushing season, for example, Ihe sorority found themselves
stuck with a flock of silly rules and regulations, with no
hope of remedying Ihe code's faults until the season ended.
In general, Ihe rules committee's proposals of a shorter
rushing season and simpler regulations are commendable.
Providing Ihe women do not over-legislate in reform, as
I hey did in enacting their present rushing prohibitions,
next quarter's Pan-Hellenic assembly may be looked to for
some constructive revision.
