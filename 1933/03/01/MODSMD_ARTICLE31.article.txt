# Practical Political Science, As Ably Demonstrated by the Governor
## 
### 
California's smiling governor, "Sunny .Jim" Rolph, has
lately exhibited an example of practical political science
of the sort that will not be found in any university text
book. Nor will the practice be found in the code of anyone
who pretends to call himself a gentleman.
The facts are these. For the past few months Rolph lias
been threatened with a recall movement initiated by a
group of men who desired to gain control of the state De
partment of Agriculture. The movement was generally
condemned by a large majority, but "Sunny .Jim" was in
clined to fear for his job.
A few days ago, completely without warning, the head
of the agricultural department was dismissed. The reason
given was honest enough. Xo mention was made of any
specific charges against the director, nor any irregularities
in his department. The dismissal was made, according to
Rolph's own statement, because it was the only act which
would pacify the men behind the recall movement.
Someone had to be sacrificed to save the governor's
skin, and the fact that it was a man who has done more for
California farmers than any of his predecessors made little
difference. It was a political trick which even Rolph's ene
mies believed he would not stoop to.
Political writers say, and it is to be hoped that they are
riglil, that California's Cardenia Kid is through.
