# California's Legislators Are Given A Broad Hint About California's Wines
## 
### 
Over hundreds of thousands of California acres, a few
years ago. spread a gray-green blanket of grape vines.
From those purple and white clusters came wines that
brought millions of dollars into the state.
I hey were good wines, as some may still remember. It
is true that Valley of the Moon champagne could not rank
with Minimi's Kxtra Dry, nor did burgundy from Lake
County compare with that from France's Cote d'Or. Hut
California produced thousands of gallons annually of cheap
and good wine. And from the upper end of the Sacramento
valley came hops. Hrewers as well as vintners bid for
California's produce.
Since 11)20, Ibis source of income to the state's farmers
lias been curtailed. Now, thirteen years later, the legisla
ture, meeting Ibis week in Sacramento, is in a position to
aid materially in the. rehabilitation of California agricul
ture by quick calling of a convention to ratify Congress'
repeal move.
This state should be among the first to set in motion the
machinery that will not only erase from the books a law
its voters have negatived, but will also lend valuable aid
to ('alilornia farmers.
