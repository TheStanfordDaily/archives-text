# BULL SESSION
## VOTE REPUBLICAN OR BUY AMERICAN 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
Among people who admit their
intelligence, it is obligatory to damn
Hearst —loudly and often. In fact,
very often one's standing with such
groups depends on how often and
how loudly one proceeds to scoff at
one of his editorials. So it was in
evitable that when he launched his
"Buy American" campaign, intellec
tuals would shudder and fume. And
the inevitable happened.
And newspapers lampooned the
new Hearst child for it was easy to
ridicule "Buy American." These edi
torial sages pointed out with great
care and familiar words the facts
known by all econ students—about
the interdependence of nations and
gold flows and the rest. Their read
ers believed them because it was
not only true but it was Hearst.
But many of these same people
have been voting Republican for
years and plan to continue doing so
—which is their own worry. Yet the
Republicans have been advocating
high tariffs and higher tariffs since
Lincoln and through Hoover—the
last raise being recently instituted
by Mr. Hoover. It has long been
held by the G.O.P. that a vote for
the G.O.P. was not only a vote for
God and country—but for high
tariff. While Ihe casual connection
with the Deity and the country was
not always clear, a boosting of tariff
rates was inevitable with the oath
at every Republican inauguration.
Now for the laugh ... A tariff
keeps out foreign goods. What does

! "Buy American" do? Keep out for
eign goods of course. What is the
difference? There is practically none
except that the venerable G.O.P. ad
vocates tariff and the other is
fathered by William Randolph
i Hearst. One has blue blood—the
other red or yellow, depending on
how you look at Hearst.
After all, all men are created
equal and the hang of a man's jaw
is not determined by the color of
his blood. Keeping trade at home
should be as laughable under any
name. Hearst, Smoot, and Hawley
are really seeking the same end.
The only difference is that Hearst,
if successful, would do at one swoop
what the Republicans have been
moving toward for years. The G.O.P.
| is crawling. Hearst is flying. Hedg
ing wins in politics but it doesn't
sell papers. Hearst sells papers. The
G.O.P. is a political institution.
There is a theoretical difference
between "Buy American" and the
Republican principle. Our tariff is
supposed to protect infant industries
while "Buy American" protects all
industry—without regard to age.
But everyone knows that tariffs are
doled out in Washington by the
power of the lobby and not the age
of the industry. Our greatest pro
ducers have the biggest tariffs.
The Republican tariff protects ac
cording to political power, "Buy
American" does the same regardless
;of age, race, color, or creed. It's
1 more democratic.

But everyone knows that tariffs are
doled out in Washington by the
power of the lobby and not the age
of the industry. Our greatest pro
ducers have the biggest tariffs.
The Republican tariff protects ac
cording to political power, "Buy
American" does the same regardless
;of age, race, color, or creed. It's
1 more democratic.
Among people who admit their
intelligence, it is obligatory to damn
Hearst —loudly and often. In fact,
very often one's standing with such
groups depends on how often and
how loudly one proceeds to scoff at
one of his editorials. So it was in
evitable that when he launched his
"Buy American" campaign, intellec
tuals would shudder and fume. And
the inevitable happened.
And newspapers lampooned the
new Hearst child for it was easy to
ridicule "Buy American." These edi
torial sages pointed out with great
care and familiar words the facts
known by all econ students—about
the interdependence of nations and
gold flows and the rest. Their read
ers believed them because it was
not only true but it was Hearst.
But many of these same people
have been voting Republican for
years and plan to continue doing so
—which is their own worry. Yet the
Republicans have been advocating
high tariffs and higher tariffs since
Lincoln and through Hoover—the
last raise being recently instituted
by Mr. Hoover. It has long been
held by the G.O.P. that a vote for
the G.O.P. was not only a vote for
God and country—but for high
tariff. While Ihe casual connection
with the Deity and the country was
not always clear, a boosting of tariff
rates was inevitable with the oath
at every Republican inauguration.
Now for the laugh ... A tariff
keeps out foreign goods. What does

! "Buy American" do? Keep out for
eign goods of course. What is the
difference? There is practically none
except that the venerable G.O.P. ad
vocates tariff and the other is
fathered by William Randolph
i Hearst. One has blue blood—the
other red or yellow, depending on
how you look at Hearst.
After all, all men are created
equal and the hang of a man's jaw
is not determined by the color of
his blood. Keeping trade at home
should be as laughable under any
name. Hearst, Smoot, and Hawley
are really seeking the same end.
The only difference is that Hearst,
if successful, would do at one swoop
what the Republicans have been
moving toward for years. The G.O.P.
| is crawling. Hearst is flying. Hedg
ing wins in politics but it doesn't
sell papers. Hearst sells papers. The
G.O.P. is a political institution.
There is a theoretical difference
between "Buy American" and the
Republican principle. Our tariff is
supposed to protect infant industries
while "Buy American" protects all
industry—without regard to age.
