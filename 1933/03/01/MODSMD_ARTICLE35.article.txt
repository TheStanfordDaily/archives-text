MUD IN OUR EYE
The Editor, Sir:
Now in your opinion there is
nothing quite so funny as a "Cam
pus Opinion" especially when that
outburst tries to be serious. We've
tried being funny in Chappie's col
umns —to no' great avail. We'll try
being serious here—and hope for a
snicker.
Now that we have been graduated
from 'neath the red-tiled roofs we
suppose that it's none of our busi
ness but somehow that column un
der the heading, "Dirt on the Farm,"
doesn't strike us as quite belonging
to any campus publication in gen
eral or to the "Dippy" in particular.
If it were subtle there might be a
place for such a revelation in the
"Razz Edition" but as it is the slan
derous mud-slinging seems to us
to be rather crude and childish. And
doesn't it strike you, Fritz, that here
is a wide-open chance for the Call-
Bulletin to capitalize on campus
scandal? It's hard enough to fill out
that hour in eigjht o'clock without
having to scrape around in the muck
for reading matter.
What say, Fritz old pal. as one
member of Hammer and Coffin to
another, let's leave these quaint lit
tle stories to Chappie editors of fu
ture years with which they may fill
their pages of "Fables on the
Farm"? It won't matter so much
then—and does it really matter even
now? —Bcrnarr Bates
