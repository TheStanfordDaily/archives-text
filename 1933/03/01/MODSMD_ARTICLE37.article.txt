GRAND GUIGNOL THEATRE
(formerly the Green Street) —A
program of one-act plays.
San Francisco theatregoers were
offered a rather pleasant surprise at
the opening of the Grand Guignol.
This new playhouse offers that
which is distinctly unusual. But it is
not only the bill that is ch inged. If
it were not for the proverbially un
comfortable seats, one might very
well believe he had never seen this
San Francisco landmark. The whole
of the interior has been remodelled
to approximate as nearly as possible
the Grand Guignol in Paris. Seekers
of novel entertainment will do well
to see at least one of the coming
performances.
However, the plays themselves
were rather disappointing. Grand
Guignol is dramatic sensation and
speed; it is not a bill of one-act
plays. It is unsatisfying to expect
such and receive the minimum
amount of the traditional horror.
"The Last Supper," though cleverly
built up, suffered somewhat from its
very obvious climax. Furthermore,
the theme is almost identical to the
conclusion of the "Doorway to Hell."
A pathetic but obvious cameo by
Louis Parker was next offered and,
though prettily rhymed, it was not
a Grand Guignol plot. Laid in the

Bastille during (he French Revolu
tion, the play prefaces the ap
proaching death by guillotine for a
Marquise and his wife who have lost
years in marking the existence of
their love.
"The Claw" by Dermot Darby was
the cream of the program. Del Law
rerifce, outstanding in the company,
portrayed the paralyzed Jean Marie,
offering all that could be expected
of a fine actor. A hopeless paralytic
is cognizant of his daughter-in-law's
infidelity and parricide. Wrought to
excessive emotion, he strangles her
with delectable gusto.
"Fear," the next play, was medi
ocre enough. The Foreign Legion
during the pneumonic plague offered
the setting and action and, if it were
not for the bloody-mouthed mes
senger, the play might have been of
exceedingly slow tempo. The con
cluding number was a French farce
which smacked of the old Green
Street technique—acting motivated
to embarrass an indulgent audience.
The Grand Guignol may give us
excellent entertainment and it is to
be hoped that a wiser selection of
plays—plays abounding in speed and
sensation, will be offered on the fu
ture programs. Though this bill was
unsatisfactory, we want Grand
Guignol from this company.

offering all that could be expected
of a fine actor. A hopeless paralytic
is cognizant of his daughter-in-law's
infidelity and parricide. Wrought to
excessive emotion, he strangles her
with delectable gusto.
"Fear," the next play, was medi
ocre enough. The Foreign Legion
during the pneumonic plague offered
the setting and action and, if it were
not for the bloody-mouthed mes
senger, the play might have been of
exceedingly slow tempo. The con
cluding number was a French farce
which smacked of the old Green
Street technique—acting motivated
to embarrass an indulgent audience.
The Grand Guignol may give us
excellent entertainment and it is to
be hoped that a wiser selection of
plays—plays abounding in speed and
sensation, will be offered on the fu
ture programs. Though this bill was
unsatisfactory, we want Grand
Guignol from this company.

GRAND GUIGNOL THEATRE
(formerly the Green Street) —A
program of one-act plays.
San Francisco theatregoers were
offered a rather pleasant surprise at
the opening of the Grand Guignol.
This new playhouse offers that
which is distinctly unusual. But it is
not only the bill that is ch inged. If
it were not for the proverbially un
comfortable seats, one might very
well believe he had never seen this
San Francisco landmark. The whole
of the interior has been remodelled
to approximate as nearly as possible
the Grand Guignol in Paris. Seekers
of novel entertainment will do well
to see at least one of the coming
performances.
However, the plays themselves
were rather disappointing. Grand
Guignol is dramatic sensation and
speed; it is not a bill of one-act
plays. It is unsatisfying to expect
such and receive the minimum
amount of the traditional horror.
"The Last Supper," though cleverly
built up, suffered somewhat from its
very obvious climax. Furthermore,
the theme is almost identical to the
conclusion of the "Doorway to Hell."
A pathetic but obvious cameo by
Louis Parker was next offered and,
though prettily rhymed, it was not
a Grand Guignol plot. Laid in the

Bastille during (he French Revolu
tion, the play prefaces the ap
proaching death by guillotine for a
Marquise and his wife who have lost
years in marking the existence of
their love.
"The Claw" by Dermot Darby was
the cream of the program. Del Law
rerifce, outstanding in the company,
portrayed the paralyzed Jean Marie,
offering all that could be expected
of a fine actor. A hopeless paralytic
is cognizant of his daughter-in-law's
infidelity and parricide. Wrought to
excessive emotion, he strangles her
with delectable gusto.
"Fear," the next play, was medi

during the pneumonic plague offered
