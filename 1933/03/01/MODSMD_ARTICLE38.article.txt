SACRAMENTO — Ed Woodbury,
Rio Linda poultry farmer, recently
dug an old hickory "dollar" out of
the attic and put it in circulation.
On it he wrote: "Good for seven and I
a half dozen eggs." Woodbury gave
the wooden money to a fuel com
pany for a dollar's worth of coal.
The company, paid it out in labor, j
The laborer met his board bill with
it. The boarding house keeper
turned it back to Woodbury for
eggs.
Finally Woodbury ran out of eggs.
So he added: "Also good for one
dressed chicken," and put it in cir
-1 culation again.
