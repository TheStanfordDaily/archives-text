Idiots, Imbeciles, Morons;
Burm s Sane Choice
I have long contended that psych
ologists are overlooking an infallible
test of intelligence when they do
not classify all those who pick all-
American football teams as idiots.
For I know of no human mental
activity (hat demands as little in
telligence and that is accompanied
by as much ballyhoo as is the an
nual naming of eleven "gridiron
greats." The individuals who do
the naming never see ten of the
eleven players, and the eleventh
is their lister's boy-friend or the
best of the hunch of hams they
themselves are coaching.
Under this system of testing in
telligence, the choosers of all-sec
tional teams would be classed as
only imbeciles because they would
have seen three rather than one of
their team-members in action. Those
v/ho chose all-Conference teams
would, I suppose, be low-grade
morons, while those who picked all
opponent teams would be classed as
high-grade morons or might pos
silbly edge in among the very low
est ranking normal persons.
THIS GENERALIZATION
APPLIES TO ALE SI'ORTS
This system of determining the
intelligence of coaches and news
paper hack-writers and magazine
editors and all others who publish
all-Arnerican teams applies to other
sports than football, as it is obvi
ously impossible for any one man
to see all the good baseball or
hockey or soccer players in the
country in action every lime they
play.
However, I shall he fair and
admit that the choosing of an all
opponent baseball team hy coaches
and players who see their oppon
ents in action three or four times
during a season does not come in
this category. And since the pur
pose ol this column today is to
acquaint you with John Bunn's
all-Southern Division basketball
team, I hastily add that I am not
at all inferring that John Bunn is
an imbecile or even a moron.
Mr. Bunn's original choice listed
Jerry Nemer of U.S.C. and Don
Piper of U.C.L.A. at the forwards,
Lee Guttero of U.S.C. at center, and
Julius Bescos of U.S.C. and John
Crowley of California as guards.
Since the final California game, Mr.
Bunn has altered his choice, sub
stituting Hal Eifert of California for
Piper and John Hancock of Stanford
for Crowley.
TIIE CHOICE OF
STAN FORI > TEAM-MEMBERS
The Stanford team was also asked
to pick an all-opponent five, and
they included Nemer and Bescos at
guards with Guttero, Piper, and
Eifert. There was considerable argu
ment around the training table the
night of the choosing, as it seemed
impertinent to make a guard out of
Nemer, who is the best forward on
the Coast. But since the purpose
of all-star teams is to show the five
best players, the choice was logical.

ents in action three or four times
during a season does not come in
this category. And since the pur
pose ol this column today is to
acquaint you with John Bunn's
all-Southern Division basketball
team, I hastily add that I am not
at all inferring that John Bunn is
an imbecile or even a moron.
Mr. Bunn's original choice listed
Jerry Nemer of U.S.C. and Don
Piper of U.C.L.A. at the forwards,
Lee Guttero of U.S.C. at center, and
Julius Bescos of U.S.C. and John
Crowley of California as guards.
Since the final California game, Mr.
Bunn has altered his choice, sub
stituting Hal Eifert of California for
Piper and John Hancock of Stanford
for Crowley.
TIIE CHOICE OF
STAN FORI > TEAM-MEMBERS
The Stanford team was also asked
to pick an all-opponent five, and
they included Nemer and Bescos at
guards with Guttero, Piper, and
Eifert. There was considerable argu
ment around the training table the
night of the choosing, as it seemed
impertinent to make a guard out of
Nemer, who is the best forward on
the Coast. But since the purpose
of all-star teams is to show the five
best players, the choice was logical.

Idiots, Imbeciles, Morons;
Burm s Sane Choice
I have long contended that psych
ologists are overlooking an infallible
test of intelligence when they do
not classify all those who pick all-
American football teams as idiots.
For I know of no human mental
activity (hat demands as little in
telligence and that is accompanied
by as much ballyhoo as is the an
nual naming of eleven "gridiron
greats." The individuals who do
the naming never see ten of the
eleven players, and the eleventh
is their lister's boy-friend or the
best of the hunch of hams they
themselves are coaching.
Under this system of testing in
telligence, the choosers of all-sec
tional teams would be classed as
only imbeciles because they would
have seen three rather than one of
their team-members in action. Those
v/ho chose all-Conference teams
would, I suppose, be low-grade
morons, while those who picked all
opponent teams would be classed as
high-grade morons or might pos
silbly edge in among the very low
est ranking normal persons.
THIS GENERALIZATION
APPLIES TO ALE SI'ORTS
This system of determining the
intelligence of coaches and news
paper hack-writers and magazine
editors and all others who publish
all-Arnerican teams applies to other
sports than football, as it is obvi
ously impossible for any one man
to see all the good baseball or
hockey or soccer players in the
country in action every lime they
play.
However, I shall he fair and
admit that the choosing of an all
opponent baseball team hy coaches
and players who see their oppon
ents in action three or four times
during a season does not come in
this category. And since the pur
pose ol this column today is to
acquaint you with John Bunn's
