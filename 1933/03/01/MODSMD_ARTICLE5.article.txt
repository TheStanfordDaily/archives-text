# LIBERALS FORM CAMPUS GROUP
## Local League For Industrial Democracy To Meet 
### 
"To propagate dangerous ideas in
a genteel manner, a branch of the
League for Industrial Democracy
will be organized on this campus,"
according to the statement of Bob
Fisher, secretary of the group which
will meet at 7:15 o'clock tonight on
the top floor of the Women's Club
house.
Daniel Gage, graduate student in
history and former representative
from South Dakota on the national
board of the League, will talk on
the aims and ideals of the national
organization. "The L.I.D. was or
ganized about the time of the World
War, taking the place of the Social
ist society of Jack London and John
Read," said Gage.
Selden Osborne, president last
quarter of the Norman Thomas-for-
President Club, stated that the con
stitution of the local chapter of the
L.I.D. had been approved by Dr.
Swain.
Osborne said: "It is the purpose
of the local group to present
highly controversial economic and
social topics in open meeting for
the consideration of the Stanford
student body."
The Stanford chapter sponsored
the recent campus address by Paul
Blanshard, New York political writ
er, who spoke to a crowded Little
Theatre on "Industrial Planning and
the Machine Age." It is the aim of
the organization to present other
speakers on such topics of current
interest.
