## 
### Francis Hamilton 
Ben Eastman will temporarily for
. sake his favorite role of the middle
distance races next Saturday in the
S.F.U.-Stanford meet and become
just another mediocre sprinter. None
too good at its best, the century and
furlong department of the Cardinal
track squad has been sadly depleted
j by the loss of Lcs Hables for this
I quarter, and the versatile "Blazer"
is to have his try at bolstering it.
I Besides Eastman, Art Rice, Frank
Lombai'di, and Jimmy Wilson are
! entered for the sprints. Rice has the
best time to date, a 10 flat hundred
in the mural meet.
Joe Burris, nominally a half and
quarter man, will team with Ferric
in the mile, and Art Azevedo runs
the two-mile with "Shuffling" Am
dahl. Phil Morentin, who was count
jed on in this event, will not be
eligible for varsity competition until
spring quarter.
Johnny Mottram, one-time frosh
football captain, has come along
with a rush in the past two Weeks,
and is now regularly doing better
than lflO feet with the javalin.
This lad has plenty of heft in the
shoulders and drive in the legs, and
promises to be the first consistently
good man this event has boasted
j for some years. Beatty and Kantzer
will be helping him out Saturday;
Dudley Sales may enter if his arm
is in shape.
Manufacture of artificial silk on
a large scale was begun in 1592.
