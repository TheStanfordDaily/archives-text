# GUS MEIER OUT OF U.S.F. MEET NEXT SATURDAY
## Injured Leg Of Stanford's Star Hurdler Fails To Heal CHARLEY STITH GOOD Quartet Of Olympic Vets Face Defeat 
### Albert Guerard, Jr 
Weakened by the loss of Gus I
Meier's ten points in the hurdles, !
Stanford's original intention of scor
ing more than 100 points against San j
Francisco University Saturday af- j
ternoon has been abandoned.
With Phil Morentin and Les
Hables ineligible until spring quar- j
ter, and Bon Eastman, ace middle
distance star, running the .sprints,
the Indian squad is considerably
weaker than the outfit that two !
weeks ago looked as strong as U.S.C.
Herbert Best
Meier's cramped leg muscle has
not responded to treatment, and
the Pacific Coast's most-improved
hurdler will not be able to run
until the Olympic Club meet on
March 11.
in Meier's absence, Cotto Herbert, !
whose specialty is the 220-lows, will |
be the strongest Indian entrant, j
Dave Packard and Dean Stallings,
still not in hurdling shape, will be!
the other Stanford hurdlers.
The U.S.F. high hurdlers are :
hardly experienced enough foi col- 1
lege competitoin. Ed Libby and Alec j
Thomas are capable of 1G seconds j
for the high sticks—no faster.
Seven Good Men
San Francisco's track team has!'
only seven performers of better
than-average ability, and Charley
Stilh, all-around-athlete par excel
lence, is the only Don athlete who j
has ever turned in near-record per- j
formances. Stith is' entered in the {
hundred-yard dash and the low !
hurdles, although he has done some j !
great middle-distance running, high- j
jumping, and broad-jumping during
his lengthy career.
At San Jose State, Stith is some- j
thing of a legend. In 1931 he ran a I
practice flight of 220-yard hurdles
in 23 seconds fiat, and was timed in j
9.5 for a hundred yards. Last year 1
Stith ran for the Olympic Club, but I
failed to get back to his 1931 form, j:

the other Stanford hurdlers.

Seven Good Men
San Francisco's track team has!'
only seven performers of better
than-average ability, and Charley
Stilh, all-around-athlete par excel
lence, is the only Don athlete who j
has ever turned in near-record per- j
formances. Stith is' entered in the {
hundred-yard dash and the low !
hurdles, although he has done some j !
great middle-distance running, high- j
jumping, and broad-jumping during
his lengthy career.
At San Jose State, Stith is some- j
thing of a legend. In 1931 he ran a I
practice flight of 220-yard hurdles
in 23 seconds fiat, and was timed in j
9.5 for a hundred yards. Last year 1
Stith ran for the Olympic Club, but I
