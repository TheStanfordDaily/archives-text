# GERMAN REVOLT PLANS BARED IN RAIDS ON REDS
## Reichstag Fire First Link In Civil War Scheme, Goering Reveals 
### 
BERLIN, March 1 (/P) â€”Hermann
Goering, Minister without Portfolio
in the Hitler Government, declared
in a speech tonight that the incen
diary fire at the Reichstag building
Monday night was meant to inau
gurate a series of violent acts cul
minating in a Communist revolu
tion.
For this reason, he asserted,
the government was justified in
promulgating its drastic decrees
of the last two days, which have
greatly increased penalties for
treason and have placed Ger
many under virtual martial law.
"Seize Berlin By Force"
The cabinet minister said Com
munists have spread handbills call
ing for the formation of groups for
so-called self-protection, but really
intended to provoke civil war.
Communist material which has
been seized, he continued, disclosed
forged orders to National Socialist
storm troopers to be in readiness
after the election next Sunday night
to seize Berlin by force. Captain
Goering interpreted this as an ob
viously intended threat to terrorize
the population.
He declared that the lives of
Communists and Socialists were
not endangered so long as they
kept strictly within the law.
Drive To Squelch Reds
Tl* i nationwide process of squelch
ing Communism continued unabated
today, with hundreds of leading
Communists undergoing arrest, and
many others fled into hiding.
President Von Hindenburg great
ly increased the powers of the gov
ernment by a decree raising the
penalties for espionage, treason, and
subversive acts. The decree estab
lished the death penalty for dis
closing or attempting to obtain im
portant military secrets, and speci
fied ten years' imprisonment for
transmitting to foreign governments
objects or news which, even if false,
should not be disseminated in the
interest of the Reich.
