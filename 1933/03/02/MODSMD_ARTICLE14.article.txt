# Farm Men Slated For Pen Debut

### Dave Mellinkoff 
Sunday, high noon, through the
grim, gray walls of San Quentin
prison will enter two gentlemen of
the Farm. Leonard Bloom, promi
nent in debating circles, and Ike
Livermore, president of the inter
fraternity council, will say farewell
tp campus friends. They have been
sentenced to debate the flower of
California felons.
Although "Resolved, That Crime
don't pay" and "Resolved, That
capital unishment should he abol
ished" had been suggested by the
Stanford debate squad, the ofiicial
topic for discussion has been
worded: "Resolved, That the Uni
ted States should cancel the Euro
pean war debts."
To insure fairness to the Stanford
team, H. A. Shuder, Director of
Education at the penitentiary, has
announced that no attorneys will be
on the prison team. The San Quen
tin speakers, one from a leading
British university and one from a
western university are, however, be
ing coached by some of the country's
best barristers.
Livermore, who will be the first
affirmative speaker to face the select
San Quentin audience, as captain of
the baseball team, represents the
newly organized athlete's debate
squad. He has been groomed for the
battle of stars and stripes by compe
tition in several squad debates. He
was also chairman of the sensational
Todd, Glover-Yaples, Ray debate.
Delta Sigma Rho's freckled and
smiling president, Bloom, is a veter
an member of the Stanford debate
squad. Last year he placed high in
the Pacific Coast extemporaneous
speaking contest. Last quarter he
presented the Democratic case at
the campus political forum.
