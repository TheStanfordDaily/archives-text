# Stranded Stanford Student Witnesses City's Low Life
## 
### SILVIA ANN COWELL 
Crazy men, dope fiends, cheap
| hoteLs with grimy leather armchairs
; and brass spitoons, 20-cent meals
I and flop houses—it was in this at
mosphere of San Francisco's Third
j Street district that a Stanford senior
I lived for two months last summer.
Stranded without money, and far
from home, the student sold lottery
I tickets to sciape up enough money
to lodge himself in a tawdry hotel
and fare on greasy food.
Many of the bums who wander up
| and down the streets are simply de
generates, he says, while the rest
are victims of the depression, search"
ing vainly for jobs.
Drink, women, and horse-racing
I is the formula which generally
lands men in the bread lines, ac
cording to the Stanford student. He
said he met a man who had been
; the head of a flourishing insurance

business, but unfaithfulness to his
wife and family, a try at betting,
and bad luck with "the other wo
man," had left him penniless.
Although there are charity or
ganizations set up by religious fana
tics, men often prefer to beg and
sleep in the streets, rather than
listen to prayers and hymns.
One man, who was half-mad, used
to '"go to work" every morning, j
which meant that he appeared near
the entrance of a main office build
ing in San Francisco, where he exe
cuted a weird dance of contortions,
then demanded payment.
The student was sitting in the I
dreary lobby reading Anatole j
France's "Penguin Island," when
suddenly a wretched looking man j
started tq talk to him about it. This '
unknown waif turned out to know
more about Anatole France than
most college professors.
