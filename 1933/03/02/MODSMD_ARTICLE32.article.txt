# INDIAN VARSITY LOSES CONTEST TO ST. MARY'S
## Moraga Batmen Come From Behind In Pinal Innings To Snatch Win SIXTH INNING CRUCIAL Gaels Stop Card Rallies Near End Of Game 
### Bob Wade 
After taking an early lead that
began to look impregnable as the
game wore on, Stanford's varsity
baseball nine saw Coach Louie
Guisto's Gael liorsehidcrs come
from behind in the closing innings
for the third time in two years to
keep up their string of victories at
Moraga ami eke out a 5-4 decision.
The Indians scored two in the first
: inning on four walks by Pitcher
! DufTy and a couple of errors, an
other in the third on a walk, a Hold
er's choice, and Delmas' triple, and
1 their last in the fifth on a walk,
fielder's choice, and two singles, by
Miles and Captain Livermore.
Cards Bunch Errors
I Fred Heringer had hurled a one
! hit game until the sixth, but in thai
j inning the Gaels managed to squeeze
; a tally across the plate when the
Cards magnanimously bunched two
I or three errors at the crucial mo
! ment.
But the marker in the sixth was
j just a faint harbinger of the bad
j news to come in the seventh. The
! MVragans got to Heringer with a
j vengeance in that frame, and when
; the smoke cleared away they had
i tied the score on three singles in
| succession and one or two more
I errors.
Gaels Nip Rallies
Stanford had one man left on
I base in the eighth and two in the
] ninth, but St. Mary's nipped both
! rallies in the bud.
Stark, who replaced Heringer,
got rid of the first three Gaels to
face him in the eighth, and the
j first one in the ninth, but he lost
his control then, and after Bar
! reilcs, slipped one down the mid
! die to Pitcher DufTy and the Mor
i aga pitcher drove out a resounding
triple tliat scored Barreillcs with
the winning tally.
i The score:
