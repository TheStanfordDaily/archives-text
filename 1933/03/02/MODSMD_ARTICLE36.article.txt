# The 						DAILY Accepts judge Springer's "Sporting Proposition"
## 
### 
As n result of tlie Daily editorials appearing last week
relative to the I raffle campaign in Palo Alto the editors
have received from Judge Springer a letter offering to let
off all student violators should the charges be proved.
I he judge's oiler ol w hat he terms a "sporting propo
sition" has heen accepted by the Daily. Springer, after
making a tentative engagement with the editors, could not
be reached last night.
The Daily maintains its stand and awaits the judge's
pleasure with what it deems sufficient proof of all asser
tions apearing in its columns. As sure as it is of its facts,
the Daily still questions the practicality of matching forces
with tlie police. I nforlunately the burden of proof lies
with the paper, not with the judge. To alter a truism,
'there is many a slip between the ticket and the bench."
Dr. Harvev Slater, head of the Palo Alto Hoard of Safety
and Uie man in question, reported over the telephone last
night that he had been neither arrested nor stopped since
the police campaign began. The Daily has at least three
witnesses who saw the doctor stopped and one who saw
him in the process of getting from a policeman either a
ticket or something closclv resembling one.
As far as the incidents concerning our Mr. Smith are
concerned, .fudge Springer admitted the truth of one of
them in his letter. The other he stated, over the telephone
to a Daily staff member, was factually true.
