# Blessed Are the Smugâ€” But They'll Still Get Their "Dirt"
## 
### 
For years and years the campus has been reading little
yarns about places, people, and pranks of local interest as
tront page boxes or as special features in their morning
paper. In the past four years, the past eight volumes, the
Daily has never received a communication which objected
to any of the news facts presented in that manner.
Hut let the paper decide to segregate news of that type
in a regular column, to run under the somewhat colorful
heading "DIRT 011 the Farm," and a veritable hail-storm
of criticism descends upon the editorial head. Rather than
print all the contrite smugness contained in the four or five
(ampus Opinions received to dale, which are mere restate
ments of the same general criticisms, the Daily will answer
them publicly, then print the ones which appear to contain
some spark of originality.
All Campus Opinion writers to date, and all would-be
communicators, may be answered in one short paragraph,
hirst ot all, since there are certain types of mind which in- j
sist upon continual reiteration of printed facts, it must be i
slated that the incidents recounted in the column arc facts.
II should also he understood that an agreement has been
reached by all the campus press correspondents that no
material run 'in "DIRT on the Farm" will find its way into
San Francisco newspapers.
