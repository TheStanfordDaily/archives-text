# Something of an Opportunity, Perhaps, is Open to DAILY Tryoutees
## 
### 
It's something of an opportunity that is being offered
to students tonight, especially to freshmen and transfers!
interested in newspaper work. The first meeting of try- j
outees for the Daily staff is scheduled for seven o'clock,
in the Daily olliec.
It's an opportunity to get in behind the scenes, to he j
exposed to more or less valuable journalistic training, to
meet some odd people, and In participate in the stafT
poker sessions.
If interested in any or all of these opportunities, drop
around.
