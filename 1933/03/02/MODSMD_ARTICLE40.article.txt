# BULL SESSION

### ABE MELLINKOFF 
The once-revered truth that "all
men are created free and equal" is
no longer revered and probably
never was the truth. Freedom-for
all has been booed to oblivion by the
j sociologists. Equality has been ten
dered the double-downward-thumb
by the psychologists. And biology,
s eugenics division, has cast grave
doubts on the propriety of a digni
! fied word like "created" with refer
' cnce to Oscar Doakes, Jr.
And of course the suffragettes
were set on making the women look
1 as simple as the men so they
i amended it to read "all men and
women" —which satisfied the women.
1 But left the original statement as
| wrong as it ever was.
Ibsen comes along and takes up
Ihe statement where Jefferson left it
' off. He takes it up, throws it down
! again, puts it through a meat
grinder, and then throws the dirty
pieces in your face. In fact, after a
i rehearsal of the fourth act of the
j "Enemy of the People," I slunk out
of the Assembly Hall biting my lips
1 and secretly ashamed of the day
back at Hawthorne Grammar School
when I had recited the Declaration
| of Independence.

happens to be spelled "S-M-I-T-H" .
; or "J-O-N-E-S" or "Mellinkoff," as
I the case may be. But all Republicans
are sure that if his name is "Roose-

All intelligent people arc similarly I

But would there be any difference—
any betterment? I doubt it. On all
| the great issues, there are as many
brainstorms and morons on one side
as the other. Take prohibition—take
a look at it before its alcoholic odor
passes from olfactory view.
A study once made showed that
about the same number of doctors,
lawyers, teachers, and bankers were
wet as ditch-diggers and plumbers
generally. Yet Ibsen, if forced to
choose, would pick the former in
preference to the latter. Probably,
he wouldn't want to choose at all.
Stealing words directly from "En(*my.
of the People," we have had "our"
leaders and thoroughbred "spaniel"
leaders. Yet just as often the "span
iels" have bitten the hand that fed
them as the "curs." In fact by the
time I reached the Engineering cor
ner, the salt of the earth seemed as
delectable as the cinnamon.
Should Ibsen come from the neth
er world to the Assembly Hall to
answer a call for "author," I would
be prompted to ask, "When is a
cur?" On the other hand this great
feeling of mine for the masses may
only be due to the excess of ultra
violet rays in these parts lately; and
a fast-disappearing head cold.
Confidentially, I think the above
it; a very subtle piece of propaganda
for the coming dramatic presenta
tion. So subtle in fact that along
with the author of this blurb, you
may not be able to remember
whether it was stated that the play
begins at 8:30 o'clock Friday night
and that it. bears the sonorous title
"Enemy of the People."
