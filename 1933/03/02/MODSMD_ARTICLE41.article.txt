TROUBLE IN PARADISE (Para
mount) —At the Menlo Theatre.
This is one of the most amusing
cinemas it has ever been my pleas
ure to see. Deftly directed by Ernst
Lubitsch, well acted by a cast of
skillful high comedians, the film
1 possesses, in addition to these vir- I
tues, that exceptionally valuable as- i
i set less frequently found than any j
1 others—a good script.
j Completely and hilariously un
j real, it makes fun, from first to last,
of every conventional cinematic
! situation, almost without allowing
j the audience to be aware of it Its ,
; comic medium is bathos, but bathos/
so keenly handled that it never be
i comes slapstick and, at the same
I time, never forgetfully becomes
I pathos.
The cast includes Miriam Hopkins, ,
i Herbert Marshall, Kay Francis, Ed- I

1 ward Everett Horton, Charles Rug
j gles, and C. Aubrey Smith—all at
their best. —Sandoe
A SUCCESSFUL CALAMITY
(Warners)—At (he Varsity Thea
tre.
Successful enough as a calamity,
this film doesn't quite rate as first
class entertainment. It is a fairly
trivial and unconvincing story about
a millionaire who announces he is '
ruined in order to regain his family
to the fireside.
The picture has a liberal number
of delightful scenes, filled with that
excellent type of Arliss humor—al
ways the same and always enjoy
able. The actor's performance is as
smooth as ever.
Mary Astor's role is not a happy
one for her, yet she handles it well.
The juveniles, Evalyn Knapp and I

William Janney, are very bad in
deed, while Grant Mitchell con
tributes a memorable performance
as the Arliss butler.
"The Mummy," which opens to
day, will be reviewed hereinafter.

THE ANIMAL KINGDOM (Radio)
—At the Theatre.
This picture, made from a play
with a basically silly situation, is,
nevertheless, worthy by virtue of
the performances of Leslie Howard,
Ann Harding, and Myrna Loy. I am
inclined to think that the latter does
(he best piece of work—possibly be
cause it is the first good part she
has had in some months.
Leslie Howard's acting is subtle
and meticulous but somewhat frigid
and consequently not as moving as
it might be. He plays objectively,
detachedly. Ann Harding has a com
paratively small role in which she
is competent, not outstanding.
