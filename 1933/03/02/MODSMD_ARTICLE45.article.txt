## ON THE FARM 
### 
KATTIE CLIFT awakened with
a start in the midst of Professor
Taylor's discourse on American
State Government to find her
brown tresses entwined around
the buttons of the shirt adorning
Chuck Clancy's manly chest.
CLANCY WAS a perfect picture
of Is My Face Rod? . . . and jolted
this Theta lass out of her peaceful
slumbers as the lecturer paused to
remark on the soothing qualities
that obviously adhered to his speech
. . . After adding that he was pleased
to note that somebody got something
out of his lecture, Taylor left Clancy
to an extensive boobing . . . They
have a Name for it . . .
LES HABLES let his coach and
"pal," Dink Templeton, talk him
into a bet that he would give up
smoking cigarettes just as long as
Stanford's cinder mentor could do
likewise . . . confident that Dink
could no more abstain tcetotally
than he (Les) could fly to the
moon . . .
Next day, Templeton appeared
. . . minus the weeds . . . CHEW
ING TOBACCO! . . . Needless to
add, Hables is plenty griped because
it seems he doesn't chaw . . . and
is forced to keep his gentlemen's
agreement . . .
WHY does Hilda Haven look dag
gers every time some wag mentions
Jackie Coogon . . .
