Time Turns Backward
S!cw!y to 1904

Equipped in ancient, cut-off foot
ball pants and shod with discarded
football shoes, a bunch of enthusi
astic Stanford men who play rugby
for : port's sake will journey up to
Ewing Field Saturday to play a
California team in the first San
Francisco rugby meeting between
the two schools since 1904.
The game is arousing comment:
lots of it. Stodgy, portly men who
have been sitting in comfortable
chairs for years are all excited
about it: lightweights who can't
play football think it swell; in fact,
Harry Maloney has received let
ters and visitors from the entire
Bay Region uho consider the re
vival of rugby something momen
tous, comparable lo the French
Revolution or Technocracy.
Among the most interesting of
the so letters is one from a group of
internes at the Stanford Hospital in
the city. Wanting to play rugby and
receiving "salaries" of ten dollars
))(•[• month per each, -the hardy
medics wrote Maloney for advice
and .shoes. Both will be sent up to
the fog and hills, and a Stanford
Econ student-Stanford medical stu
dent rugby game may be the result.

THE FUND ANI) FUN
In their annual pilgrimage from
the obscurity of daily exercise to
Iho notorii ty of Stanford Daily
headlines, a goodly number of
toughies will wrestle at 8 o'clock
tonight in the Pavilion for the self
satisfaction of physical supremacy
and the fund for Student Relief.
The charge will be twenty-five cents
per person, and Les Hables is sell
ing tickets and hoping to reach the
successful total garnered at the first
rugby game.
Wrestling is at present not even
a minor sport at Stanford, and j
there is a petition going the rounds
which, when adequately signed,
will be presented to the Ex Com
mittee in an attempt to give
wrestling due recognition. A sur- !
prisingly large number of sur- '

easily, you may and can read the
red-hot dirt right now. In another

Although I have excused the ;
choosing of all-opponent teams by j
coaches and players who curse or j
play against their opponents as the j
case may be, I cannot sot myself i
up as an expert comparable to j
Bunn or the Stanford players. But '
I can in good faith and judgment
print the concensus of opinion
concerning Stanford's opponents.
The cagers of the Coast, including i
Jerry Nemer, consider Jerry Nemer '
(lie finest basketball thing in these !
or most any parts. Don Piper is the |
most gentlemanly and the best sport |
among Stanford opponents. Keith
Topping is the best of Stanford's
basketballers by quite some dis
tance, and is one of the smoothest
players anywhere. Lee Guttero i
ranks first among under-the-basket j
workers and can control the tip-off j
from all centers he has faced.
Julius Bescos (like Nemer and j
Guttero, from U.S.C.) is the finest I
guard in the Southern Division, j
and little Pesco from Santa Clara
is the best among non-Conference !
players. John Hancock is Stan
ford's most consistently excellent j
player. Hal Eifert is the best shot.
Wemple, from California, is the |
roughest. Tom Cordry is among j
lia all-time most expert defensive
forwards. Sam Barry is the fastest
moving coach in this or any other
Conference.
