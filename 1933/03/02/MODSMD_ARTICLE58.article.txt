# RELAY SWIMMERS BREAK COAST RECORD IN TRIAL
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity swimming stock
took a decided rise yesterday when
the 300-yard medley relay team
bettered the former Pacific Coak
Intercollegiate record by two sec
onds, covering the distance in 2:(>9.7
in a time trial. Captain Fred Teb
betts, backstroke, Bob Clark,
breaststroke, and Ted Wiget, free
style, composed the team which
broke the record.
The Indian mermen are heavy fa
vorites to make it sixteen slraight
victories over the e√üars when the
two teams formally open '.he new
pools of the California gymnasium
Saturday.
Including two champions and a
bevy of stars, Stanford is strong in
the same events as California, but
the local .should have an
edge in most of the races. Tbbetts

should have little difficulty winning
the bakcstroke, and Ted Wiget, Na
tional Intercollegiate quarter-mile
champion, .should have no trouble
capturing the 440- and 220-yard
events.
The feature race of the after
noon will undoubtedly he between
Bob Clark, Stanford's Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate breaststroke cham
pion, and Dean Langworthy, sen
sational sophomore from Berke
ley, who has made better time
than Clark in time trials. It is
quite possible that the winner of
this event will crack Buster
Crabbe's Pacific Coast record.
Other Stanford swimmers who will
make the trip are Graves, Hirsch,
Triolo, Raven, DeLarrtter, von
Saltza, Olds, Wilbur, Fitting, Fried
man, and either Shallenberger or
W ardwell.
