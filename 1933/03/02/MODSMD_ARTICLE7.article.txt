# Smash China's Grip In Jehol
## Only Southern Fringe Not Captured By Japan 
### 
CHINCHOW, Manchuria, March
1 (/P): â€”The Japanese military com
mand announced its army of the
north entered Chihfeng, commercial
and transportation center of Jehol
province, at 4 p.m. today. No Chi
nese resistance was offered, it said.
General Heijiro Hattori, com
manding the 14th brigade of the
Japanese army, entered the city of
Lingyuan, Jehol, shortly after night
fall today.
More rapidly and with fewer
losses than even the most san
guine Japanese had hoped, Jehol
appeared to be slipping from
China's grasp.
The defenses were crumbling un
der the triphammer blows of the
war machine of General Hobuyoshi
Muto, commander in chief of the
Japanese army in Manchuria. De
fections from the Chinese forces
also were said to have played a
part.
Tonight only the southern fringe
of the western mountain wastes in
Jehol province remained Chinese,
and Japanese leaders were specu
lating whether a complete Chinese
debacle would admit them to Jehol
city prior to March 10, the army's
memorial day.
