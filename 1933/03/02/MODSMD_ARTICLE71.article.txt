# STANFORD BOXERS MEET CAL AGGIES TOMORROW NIGHT
## 
### 
Featuring the intercollegiate de
buts of three Stanford men: Keith
Topping, light-heavyweight; Ben
Cave, welterweight, and John Hus
ton, lightweight, Stanford's boxing
team engages the California Aggies
in a series of return bouts at Davis
tomorrow night.
Less than a week after starring
against California in basketball,
good-looking Topping, a dynamic
puncher, will be favored to win
over Gilbert Borba, Aggie veteran.
Though basketball kept Topping
from competing in the last intercol
legiate bouts with Davis, won by
Stanford 6-5, and in the California
matches a week ago, the star center
found time last fall to win the no
vice tournament from Bob Ransom.
Ben Cave has so far made his
mark in the University on the basis
of good poetry—not boxing. His only
competition was in the novice tour
nament when he lost his first-round
match. Since then Cave has rapidly
become a fine boxer, and will re
place Bob Quinn.
John Huston, the third man to
make his pugilistic bok, is a speedy
lightweight. He has put on quite a
few pounds since winning the no
vice featherweight title last fall, and
is not in the best of shape. He tights
Joe Herzog tomorrow night.
