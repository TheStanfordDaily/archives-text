# Varsity Swim Team Meets U.C. Tomorrow
## 
### 
Featured by the breaststroke duel
between Stanford's Bob Clark, Pa
cific Coast Intercollegiate champion,
and Dean Langworthy, sensational
sophomore flash from California, the
annual swimming meet between the
two institutions will be held tomor
row afternoon at Berkeley.
Langworthy has already made
better time in practice than Clark
and it is not unlikely that the win
ner will break Buster Crabbe's Pa
cific Coasl record.
Captain Fred Tebbetts should
have little difficulty capturing the
backstroke event and Ted Wiget,
National Intercollegiate quarter
mile champion, is certain of firsts in
the 440- and 220-yard grinds.
California's two sprinters, Fred
Kothe and Jim McKay should be at
least an even match for Stanford's
Gordon Graves and Dick Hirsch,
while the Bears' best diver, Rufus
Rucker, hafc a very good chance of
capturing first place in this event
from Milt Friedman of the Cards.
