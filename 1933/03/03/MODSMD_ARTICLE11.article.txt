# St. Mary's, Card Nines Will Play Tomorrow
## 
### 
After dropping the second St.
Mary's game in a complete reversal
of form Wednesday, Stanford varsity
baseball men will attempt, a come
back when they meet the Gaels at
2:30 o'clock tomorrow afternoon on
the Sunken Diamond in the third
and deciding game of the series.
The Indians overwhelmed St.
Mary's in their first game 19 to 0,
but literally threw Wednesday's
fiasco away after holding a four
run lead in the sixth inning. A vic
tory tomorrow will give the series
to Stanford but will leave them in
second place in the league standings,
California holding the top position
with one victory and no defeats.
