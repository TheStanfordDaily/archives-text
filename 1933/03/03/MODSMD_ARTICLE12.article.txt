# BANNISTER, KAY ON FARM AFTER FORENSIC TOUR
## Card Debaters Complete Successful Swing Of Western Colleges 
### 
Stanford's traveling representa- i
I tives, debaters Wayne Bannister and
! Ronald Kay, returned yesterday
I from a two weeks' tour of Rocky
I Mountain colleges.
They completed one of the most
successful forensic trips ever made
j by a Stanford team: eight debates
j and undefeated in contests with
! Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Arizona,
j and New Mexico universities.
Travels Agree
Yesterday both debaters indicated
1 that traveling was quite agreeable.
I Said Kay: "I gained a world of ex
perience, not only in debateâ€”but in
a few other things as well. . . .
j Bannister was his usual cool, calm,
' collected, conservative self."
According to Bannister "a good
time was had by all. I managed to
keep my politics to myself most of
l the time-except once. In the next to
last debate I let loose at the Demo
: crats." Referring to his colleague,
jhe said: "Kay's function as first
| speaker was to beam pleasantly
i upon the audience; he performed
j his job well, for there were no (
j brickbats or tomatoes in any of the
! debates."
Pay Respects
At Tuscon, Arizona, the men paid
j their respects to Stanford's Professor
j of Public Speaking James Gordon
1 Emerson, who is convalescing there
I at the United States Veterans hos
j pital. Also here they enjoyed one of
; the most interesting debates of the
j tour. One of the speakers for the
University of Arizona was Will
| Rogers, Jr., ex-Stanford student.
1 The New Mexico Normal Univer-
I sity at Las Vegas not only gave a
| dance in honor of the debaters, but
I was host to the two men on the next <
| day. "Sightseeing and women were
I fine."
