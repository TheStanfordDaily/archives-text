## 
### FRANCIS HAMILTON 
Former muckraker Lincoln Stef
fens inaugurated the first meeting
of the newly-formed Stanford Press
Club yesterday afternoon at Toyon
Hall by warning student journalists
that newspapers must change be
cause the world is changing.
"The newspapers of the future
will not carry sensational front
page murder stories," he stated.
"Good reporters nistead wlil ex
plain the significance—(lie under
lying motives—of the killer."
The true ideal of a newspaper, he
said, consists in the complete and
accurate interpretation of history in
the making, and in the intelligent
guidance of public opinion.
Humorously referring to himself
as "disillusioned," Mr. Steffens pro
ceeded, ' The world isn't going my

1 way. My dreams will never be real
ized—they will never be realized
because the world of today and the j
world of tomorrow are finer than |
all the Utopias ever dreamt." «j
But Lincoln Steffens still remains i
"Capitalism s Bad Boy." He is 'sym- i
pathetic with Soviet Russia and |
admires the perseverance and ideal- j
ism of the typical communist. The
Steffens of younger days, bitter in 1
his attacks of the social order, was I
recalled when he said:
"It is a strange civilization (hat j
prouocs more than it can consume
and a wicked civilization that will
distribute only at a profit. I've lost
my idealism and it was good for
me. For those ideals were only
part of the grand lie Society tells
us all."
