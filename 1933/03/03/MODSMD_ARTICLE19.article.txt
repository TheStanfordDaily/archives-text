## Sandoe, Crary, Bowman, Day, Well-Placed In Dramatic Roles 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
j The respective talents of Henrik
i Ibsen. Harold Helvenston, Fred I
j
Stover, and James Sandoe combine ■
! tonight to present "An Enemy of !
! the People" to the Assembly Hall |
| audience at precisely 8:30 o'clock,
i The piece is one of Ibsen's finest j
j works, his answer to the contention
| that he was condemning society in j
his "Ghosts," as well as a refutation
; of Bjornson's theory that the ma- i
I jority is always right. Satiric com
! tdy is the keynote of this five-act j
! play, and each role offers individual 1
! opportunity for characterization.
Director Helvenston has been re
! hearsing the play for nearly a month j
j and through cut ting, casting, and di- '
! rection is emphasizing the finest :
i qualities of Ibsen's opus.
Stover's sets, four in number, are !
severe and atmospheric represent;!- ''
tions of Norway in the '90's and
form a fitting background for the
play.
James Sandoe has an excellent I
i role which offers him something :
' different from the comedy of "Ber- |
j keley Square" or the drama of '
I "Romeo and Juliet"—Dr. Thomas'
j Stockmann, medical director of the '
j Municipal Baths.
A. Grove Day, Mary Ann Crary, j
! and Fritzi-Beth Bowman are all '
; provided with highly dramatic roles |
j for which they are eminently fitted, |
| and the remainder of the cast is said ;
j to be extremely well rounded. To
