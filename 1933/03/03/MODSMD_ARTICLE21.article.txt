lineup and the possibility of a third, j
j Coach Murray Cuddeback's frosh
I baseball team does battle with the
! powerful nine of Roosevelt High

j mond.
Making his first appearance be
-1 hind the plate this season will be I
Frank Tremaine, while Addie Bar
nett of recent basketball fame will
start as a shortstop.

Franchesci, the southpaw mound
! artist, will opeu as chuckcr, and, if
j his past performances mean any
| thing, should tiun in a creditable
I performance.
