### 
WHILE California's banking system lay crippled from Governor James
i Ilolpli Jr.'s three-day "hank holiday" and $3,000,000,000 was tied up
in state and national hanks, Stanford money centers rested easily on the
statement of I'alo Alto hanks that they were entirely solvent and never
in better condition.
Edward Ilainey, state superintendent of hanking, was last night drafting
i protective measures to save California hanks from heavy withdrawals by
Eastern depositors, it was rumored in hanking circles.

Henry McArthur, secretary of the
( Merchants Association, is quoted as
saying that local bankers expressed
, the opinion yesterday morning that
, California and Oregon banks were
in the best condition of the entire
federal financial system.
Faced with the possibility that
Governor Kolph might follow the
precedent set by Middlewestern
governors and extend the "bank
holiday," there were speculations
in some quarters over the chances
| of installing a system of script for
campus purchases.
The idea would utilize the Book
store as a clearing house, each stu
dent being allowed to cash a check
in return for script. On the re
opening of the banks the Bookstore
I! would redeem the script.
