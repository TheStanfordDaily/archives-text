# Bank Recess Is Laudable Says Dowrie
## Stanford Savant Recalls Former "Holidays" 
### Dave Mellinkoff 
The bank holiday which is no
holiday. What about it? Stanford
Professor of Finance George W.
' Dowrie answers thus:
"Governor Rolph's declaration of
| a bank holiday is both commendable
| and necessary. Banks and the peo
ple's funds must be protected against
| hysteria.
| "No bank is able to meet the de
j mands of all depositors at all times,
ilt would be impossible to stay in
! business under such conditions. But
j under present California law, no
j bank has the right to restrict any
! withdrawals. Money must be pro
j duced upon demand.
"The holiday will give the legis
-1 lature time to pass measures reme
j dying this condition. In some states
; where a holiday has been previously
| declared, state legislatures have lim
! ited amounts of withdrawals to five
| per cent over a given period.
In other sections any amount of
: money can be withdrawn if urgent
j need is shown. A still third method
i is to leave the distribution of funds
to the discretion of the local bank
board of directors."
Dowrie said that in 1907 he lived
I through a thirty-day bank holiday
j in Oklahoma. Quote: "People soon
j adjusted themselves to the new con
j ditions. We were able to withdraw
I five dollars a day. Checks soon be-
I came a sort of accepted currency,
i The clearing house also printed a
j temporary substitute for cash.
J "The measure is sane and sensible,
| and we will profit by it. California
J banks are probably in a better fi
-1 nancial condition than banks in most
j parts of the country."
