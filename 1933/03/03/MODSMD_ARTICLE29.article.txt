Need ;i judge be a gentleman? Or docs Ihc fact that a
man has been elevated lo Ihc position of a small-town po
lice judge relit ,c him of Ihc necessity of observing ordi
nary courtesies?
Judge Springer has slated by letter and over (lie tele
phone his willingness to meet with the Daily editors and
allow Iheni to substantiate the charges made in recent edi
torials. Wednesday night the .judge broke a tentative en
gagement set by himself. That was excusable.
Yesterday Springer announced his refusal to have anv
further dealings with the case until such time as his letter
was printed by the I)mi y. This was an outright breaking
of a written and verbal agreement and is inexcusable.
Again yesterday the editor reached Springer bv telephone
in an endeavor to attain an understanding. In the middle
of his conversation with the judge the receiver was slam
med down without a word of warning. That is more than
inexcusable.
The Dau.y fails to see any reason why il should print
the judge's long and verbose letter. The facts contained in
il were printed in yesterday's editorial. The judge's "sport
ing proposition '' grows more unsporting every day. Where
before the issue was clear-cut, il is now clouded over by
Springer's evasions and pettiness.
Furthermore, the Daim has gone lo a great deal of
(rouble in an elTorl lo secure a group of unprejudiced men
to judge on the merits of the case. Obviously, the judg
ment should not rest with Springer. Xor would il be ad
visable lo allow the case lo be tried in Ihc pages of a small
town proselyted newspaper. Bui a fair judgment of any
sort is impossible as long as Springer continues to evade
the issue.
II seems as though the only sure way lo obtain an audi
ence with .ludgc Springer is lo heave a brick through a
police court window. Kven then our friend "Mr. Smith"
would probably be able It) gel us oil.
