# Fans Expectant
## 
### 
They will converge on the Old
Oval in an expectant mood, sniffing
the kindly Ma-ch wind and ready to
.see just what kind of a bid Stanford
will make this season to regain the
laurels th.it have been slightly
smudged by U.S.C. in the past few
years. But they will see nothing
more than a substantial sample of
the team, because the portion of the
squad which will be hors de combat
Saturday (on account of scholarship
or injuries) increases daily.
Quite a neat team could be made
out of merely those men who will
not see service against S.F.U. Look
over these names: Les Hables, Gus
Meier, Paul Zaclies, Phil Morentin,
Dud Sales. Plenty of punch there,
brother.
Ben to Bolster
So Ben Eastman will take to the
sprints in an effort to better that
division. Bon also runs anchor in
the relay, which will be a family
affair, with the two Eastman broth
ers and the two Blackman brothers
teaming up.
That leaves Frank Fullenwider
and the Blackmans for the quarter,
Dan Murphy and Naylon for the
half, and Joe Burris and Jim Ferrie
in the mile. Art Azevedo and Ollie
Amdahl will do the long grind in I
the two-mile.
/aches Out
In the absence of Zaches, Phil !
Williams, Phil Williard, and Bill I
Peppy will do all the broad-jump- j
ing. Sensational Johnny Mottram j
leads the javelin men. Johnny â– 
reached 19(5 feet this week, and j
shows improvement every day.
That hard-to-beat trio of weight- j
men, Nellie Gray. Here Laborde, and |
John Lyman, will take care of the |
shot and discus. In the pole vault i
we have Bill Miller and Bud Dea- j
con, just a couple of fourteen-foot j
vaulters, along with Van Dellen. i
