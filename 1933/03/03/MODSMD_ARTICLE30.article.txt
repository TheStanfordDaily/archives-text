## 
### 
Although il seems unlikely thai the Assembly Halt box
olTice will be swamped bv a rush of business tonight, the
presentation of Ibsen's "An Knemy of the People" will
probably be a most artistic one.
Perhaps unfortunate is this choice of drama to draw
campus patrons into the Assembly Hall's hard seats. A play
better suited to the popular taste would seem to be more
desirable; il is. a I lei' all, the popular taste and nothing else
which buys the tickets and cascades the coin into the cash
registers.
This is. of course, nothing bid a materialistic attitude
toward the • (age, one of the world's sacrosanct arts. Such
an altitude, ( rass and low-brow, has been decried by lovers
ot the true and beautiful quite a tew limes in the last few
centuries. Hut materialism has its place, lowly as it may
be, when art is expected to (unction as a pav-as-vou-enter
proposition.
However, the campus rightfully expects a presentation
of taste and mei it, combining the talents of Mr. Stover and
Mt. 11e! vensl <>n, and aided b\ what looks to be on paper a
good cast.
11 may not pay. but it's art.
