# BULL SESSION

### ABE MELLINKOFF 
To those few who read a city
| newspaper or lo the larger number
I that have tried cashing checks, it is
| no longer news that California has
| been given a "Bank Holiday"—a
pleasant sounding word for an an
noying situation. The Holiday has
I made the campus bank-conscious
\ whereas before we were merely
check-hopeful. How, why, and
I when-do-they-open are the new
topics of conversation.
All the econ courses in the school
1 never budged the students beyond
i a most perfunctory memorization of
j the provisions of (he Federal Re
! serve Act. Eut a statement by Rolph
i —he of the gardenia in the button
hole and a graft investigation, in the
State Senate—sets us all to worry
ing about banks in general and how
l to get money in particular.
There was a time when the mus
ket symbolized America. As the In
dians were killed off, the plow was
! mustered into print as the emblem
' of the new frontier. Later when
i Greeley's advice was taken literally,
and lowa became a state—to the
wonder of many and the amusement
of all—the corner grocery-store
typified the national life. We had
advanced from the musket to the
! cracker box. But progress wouldn't
let us alone. Today, no one will deny
that it is the Bank that ia the key
and center of all things. If the gas
I stations close, we ride street cars. If
j the motormen strike, we use autos.
But when the banks close, we

' can't do anything. Shut the banks
and the suffers acute
colic—writhes like a cobra—and
moans like a congressman's relative
who has be2n kicked out of the
public trough. The banks are not
only the lifci blood; they are the
heart, lungs, and stomach. They
have become the nation.
It takes a punch in the economic
solor-plexus like this Holiday to
make people realize that, perhaps,
more government in banking would
n't be a bad idea. No one runs on
the Postal Savings. We laugh at the
I government—which is very appro
priate at times. But there is some
thing so dominating in a fleet of
battleships and a battery of printing
presses at the mint, that we never
question the financial power of
Washington despite an unbalanced
budget and a Huey Long.
To sophisticated skeptics who still
persisted in yawning at this thing
called depression, the Holiday may
be an awakening. To one in parti
cular who birded me a month ago
for becoming serious and probably
dull over the crisis, I cannot help
but laugh. The poor boy can't buy
gas for his fancy roadster.
The proverbial wolf has become a
thundering herd. The situation is re
versed; we are now at the door. We
have new shufflers at Washington
or will have March 4th. Whether
there will be a new deal is not so
clear. We need some new cards and
probably new chips as well.
