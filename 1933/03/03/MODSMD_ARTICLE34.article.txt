CYNARA (United Artists) —At the
Stanford Theatre.
Made very poignant by the sensi
tive and subtle acting of Ronald
Colman, the movie version of "Cy
nara" is at times better than, at
times not as good as, the excellent
stage play. The adaptation is un
even; it follows the stage version
closely, but the central theme of a
basically fine man ensnared in his
own goodness is so obscured that it
is a conjecture whether, without the
background of the legitimate ver
sion, it would be apparent.
The stage play was amazing in the
clarity of each character's viewpoint,
in the sympathy for the two women
widely separated in social position
but exactly alike in their possessive
love for Jim Warlock, and in the
sympathy for Warlock himself in
evitably caught and propelled by
the tragic situation.
It is because of occasionally faulty
direction, because of the difficulty
of seeing Jim and Clemency War
lock instead of Ronald Colman and
Kay Francis, that much of the play's
force is lost. We regard the piny as
a fine example of modern tragedy;
we look upon the movie as just an
other problem play.
The beauty contest scene, which
was very funny but distinctly out of
tone on the stage, is improved in
finitely on the screen by elimination
of most of the burlesque characters
and insertion of an impromptu

speech by Colman which is a gem of
satire. But Colraan, playing his com
edy to perfection and his serious
scenes almost as well, achieves his
finest moment in the scene in his
study when the policeman an
nounces the suicide of the shop girl,
r< scene which, by its competent di
rection and excellent acting, far sur
passes in true dramatic quality the
same scene on the stage, which re
lied en a trick. Due to bad cutting
and the inexperience of Phyllis
Barry, the scene in the shop girl's
bedroom falls short of the play's
standard. In the early part of the
film, Barry pdays sincerely and in
tensely. Kay Francis' acting was
smooth and natural, comparing fa
vorably to the legitimate interpreta
tion and bettering it in the final
scenes. Henry Stephenson repeats
the role of Tring, which he created
in New York.
Prophecy: For those who did not
see the San Francisco production,
"Cynara" will be an interesting and
moving production. For those who
saw the play, baffled uneasiness and
disappointment interspersed with
joy over the improvement of specific
scenes. —Brauns
