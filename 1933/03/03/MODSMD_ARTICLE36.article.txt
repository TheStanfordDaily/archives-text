## ON THE FARM 
### 
MARVIE KAIIN and Paul Tar
ghetla try to keep a bet and sleep
out on the lawn in front of Toyon
all night . . . attempt cancelled
after six or eight oranges, apples,
ami other miscellaneous fruit in a
wholesale barrage struck the pair
. . . they settled for two bananas.
. . . JOHN ULRICH was initiated
into the ranks of manhood last
night with appropriate serenades
on the occasion of his twenty-first
birthday . . .
CERTAIN PI PHI'S, after eyeing
the Dekes' would-be bull covetous
ly foi awhile, decided that it would
be a noble thing to lead animal
astray some dark night . . . have a
Paly butcher slaughter it for 25s . . .
hold a barbecue for the two houses
. . . etc. ... THE PLAN went
astray when the Dekcs offered to
give the calf to the girls anyway . . .
808 ROTII, frosh star and a
master Turtle, is quite ill at ease
these days, as his brother Turtles
are merely waiting for a full moon
and a body of water and a nice
quiet evening to do things to Mr.
Roth . . . who claims to be a
Honeybear as do several other
campus big shots.
WHY DID Franklin Gilchrist turn
over in the canoe out at Lagunita
with Lillian Harris . . .
