## SONG OF THE G.O.P. POSTMASTER 
### OLD DR. ALGAR 
(.More than Hi.ooo postmaster will
lie appointed by President-elect
Roosevelt during his four-year term.
—News item.)
Since all my political betters
Lost out in the government fray
No more will I guide grimy letters
To Moscow and points on the way.
The hoys who showed Frankie
affection
Will now hang the packages frail—
I'll wait the four years till election
And maybe come back "return
mail."
