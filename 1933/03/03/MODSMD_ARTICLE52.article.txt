# CAL AGGIES CLASH WITH CARD BOXERS; 9 BOUTS TONIGHT
## 
### 
Keith Topping, Jim Feely, and
Captain Fred Glover, three of the
best amateur boxers on the Pacific
Coast, will lead Stanford's boxing
team against the California Aggies
at Davis tonight. The nine-bout card
will begin at 8 o'clock. The first
meeting of the two teams on Febru
ary 9 ended in a 6-5 victory for the
I Indians.
While interest will center on the
Jim Feely-De La Cruz and Fred
| Glover-Angelo Mazetta battles,
Stanford fans will be watching with
interest the intercollegiate debut of
three Indian fighters: hard-hitting
Keith Topping, shifty Ben Cave, and
speedy John Houston. Tonight's
clash between De La Cruz and
Feely should provide some of the
season's fanciest fighting. The Glo
ver-Jewett rematch is a natural.
Glover captains the Indian nboxers
while Jewett is the Aggie leader.
Has light-heavyweight Keith Top
ping the dynamic punch he is cred
ited with? His battle with Gilbert
Borba may furnish the answer.
Stanford's junior middleweights,
Waldo Munday, and Oscar Baer,
should garner a brace of victories
for Stanford, while Newt Ridley and
Een Cave, the Stanford welter
weights, face two experienced op
! ponents in Jim Apperson and
Maurice Ilogan. John Fowler will
attempt to upset Gene Crump in the
middleweight division. Crump won
a close nod the last time the two
I men "fought.
