# Delta Tau's Take Mural Swim Title
## 
### 
Led by peerless Phil Bateson, who
garnered firsts in the 50- and 100-
yard freestyle events and swam the
fastest anchor lap on the winning
relay team. Delta Tau Delta won the
finals of the intramural swimming
meet staged yesterday afternoon in
Encina pool with a point total of 23.
Chi Psi with 16 digits placed second
and Kappa Sigma, in chalking up 12
makers, took third.
Although the meet was not as
sensational as were Tuesday's trials
from the standpoint of record
breaking the boys were able to set
new marks in the 150-yard freestyle
and the four-man 200-yard freestyle
relay.
Erskine of Delta Tau created a
sensation when he plowed in a yard
ahead of Underhill to break the rec
ord set up by the latter in the
trials. Clocked in 1:40 flat, Erskine's
effort eclipsed Underbill's mark by
nearly four full seconds.
Although Bateson was not able to
break his trial marks in grabbing
the 50- and 100-yard froestyles, he
contributed largely to the Dolts' new
record in the relay.
The closest contest of the day saw
Dole of Phi Kappa Sigma winning
the 75-yard breaststroke over Mc-
Bryde of Chi Psi who set a new
mark in this distance in Tuesday's
trials. Dole failed to lower the lat
ter's mark but the distance
in very good time. I
In the only other race of the day
Pollok of Kappa Sigma was not able
lo shatter his trial mark but showed
his heels to all competitors in the
75-yard backstroke.
