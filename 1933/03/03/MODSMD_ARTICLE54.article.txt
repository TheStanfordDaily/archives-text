# CARD GOLFERS TO MEET SEARS FOR BIG MATCH TODAY
## 
### Jay Graves 
As Stanford's six stalwart golfers
face a high-ranking squad from
California in today's annual Cardi
nal-Bear matches, Eddie Twiggs,
Stanford coach, admits things look
pretty bad, but lie is hoping for the
best.
Stanford's varsity team, headed by
Lawson Little and Harry Eichelbcr
ger, will a J include Gene Brown,
Dick Giddings, Tom Dwyer, and
Jack Geer. These boys are all ca
pable of shooting 76 or under, and
with Little practically certain of a
71 to 73, the boys should at least
put up a good showing.
There will be no let-down today,
declares Twiggs, and if anything
goes wrong it won't be because the
boys aren't trying or that they arc
over-confident. Eddie believes that
the boys will rise to the occasion.
There will be six two-ball matches
for both varsity and frosh squads,
and each of the boys will play in a
four-ball match, three matches to
ihe team.
Don Edwards, ranking frosh
golfer, will lead the baby Cards
against an underdog Cub squad.
With him will be Bob Thompson,
Ed Littlefield, Roger Pearson, Bud
Nicholas, and Hugh Mellon, he of
the sensational rise to team place.
Twiggs feels that the frosh are in
an admirable spot, and, barring
over-confidence, or a very unex
pected off day, they should win
without any trouble. '
