# NEW MEN SHINE AS CARDS DOWN DON TRACKMEN
## Mottram, Herbert, Wilson Look Good; "Blaer" Takes 220 Dash OLYMPIANS IN FORM Miller And Deacon Vault Fourteen Feet 
### Albert Guerard 
San Francisco University's so
called track team has departed from
the scene of Saturday's 107-24 car
nage, but 2500 fans who witnessed
the first 1933 appearance of "Dink"
Templeton's Indian trackmen are
very strongly convinced of four
things:
1. Johnny Moltrain is a great
javelin thrower
2. Cotto Herbert is a great low
hurdler
3. Jimmy VVillson has "come
back" with a vengeance
4. Stanford's Olympic "Big
Four" is as good as ever
Curly-haired Johnny Mottram
threw the javelin six times over 190
feet, reaching 196 on his best toss.
He looks more like the Finn javelin
throwers now than most American
spear experts do at the peak of their
careers. There is 110 reason why
Mottram should not develop into the
best javelin thrower .in .Stanford
history.
Nears Record
Cotto Herbert's 23.7 time for the
low hurdles is just a fifth of a sec
ond above Podge Smith's Big Meet
record. Better competition and an
inch or two less clearance over the
barriers would have brought Her
bert very close to Jack Keller's
world record for the event.
Jimmy Willson disproved the old
track-and-field password: "They
don't come back!" Jimmy's :09.9 vic
tory in the hundred was no flukeâ€”
I he former interscholastic champion
tore into the tape with a substantial
lead over Ben Eastman and Art
Rice. Willson was going away at the
finish.
Stanford's "Big Four" of Olym
pic veterans put an end to all
whisperings that they had slipped
"just a wee hit." Captain Ben
Eastman turned in three sterling
performances: 10 flat for the 100,
21.1 for the 220, and 47.4 for his
anchor lap of the mile relay. His
furlong time was given the most
praise, hut Eastman's speedy 440,
coming such a short time later,
was a much greater accomplish
ment.
Bill Miller and Bud Deacon pole
vaulted fourteen feet. This sensa
tional climbing is itself worthy of a
banner headline but Stanford's two
vaulters are so good t Hat only world
records will arouse track fans and
press scribes. Neither man was at
his best: Miller was using a new
pole, Deacon spent the morning and
early afternoon carrying luggage.
But fourteen-foot vaulting neetW no
excuses.
It WAS a good meet, 107-24 not
withstanding.
