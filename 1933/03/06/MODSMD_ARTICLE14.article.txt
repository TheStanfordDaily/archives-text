# Ibsen Drama Proves Good
## Sandoe Impressive In Lead; Bowman, Day Praised 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
Spirited direction of a well
rounded cast was the distinguishing
feature of Friday night's presenta
tion of '"An Enemy of the People."
It is not a lively piece, this tale of
a man who defies his town in de
fense of what he believes to be the
right and contends that "the most
dangerous enemy to truth and free
dom i.s the compact majority."
Helvenston's direction—especially
in Acts 111 and IV—displayed a mas
tery of comedy and character-draw
ing which made the production more
interesting and less pedantic than
Ibsen penned it. The meeting scene
was admirably treated as to charac
ters, make-up, and placing of the
crowd.
Too much credit cannot be given
Frederick Stwover for his handling
of the difficult problem of four sets.
• Dr. Thomas Stockmann is Ibsen's
mouthpiece in this play, and it is a
difficult role which no one on the
campus could have done better than
did James Sandoe, whose experience
and poise stood him in good stead.
