Bankers across the nation argued

ford campus settled down last night
to ride out the storm of "bank holi
days," when Governor James
Rclph's new three-day moratorium
goes into effect this morning.
The Union Cellar and Bookstore
on the campus reiterated their
pledges of co-operation and con
tinued the policy of accepting stu
dent checks for amount of the pur
chase. Palo Alto banking officials
will meet early this morning with
the Merchants Association to act on
week-end developments.
Script lias not been considered
for Palo Alt oor campus use, local
bankers reported last night. Clear
ing house certificates may be is
sued, it was declared.
"No official move on the part of
the city government has been con
templated or will be unless the situ
ation becomes more tense," Mayor
Earl C. Thomas said last night.
Script Necessary
Palo Alto banks announce that
during the present situation the cus
tomary fines will not be charged on
commercial accounts that fall below
$50.

clearing house was expected 1110-
mentarility this morning, concern
ing its all-day session yesterday to
dccide on the issuance of script.
Superintendent of Banks Edward
Rainey declared script to be nec
essary under the present condi
tions.
Foreign money centers shied clear
of the American dollar in week-end
reports. The London Exchange sus
pended dealing in American cur
rency. The U.S. dollar was not
quoted on the Brussels Exchange.
Answering the Bank of Amer
ica's reluctance to enter into the
holiday, L. M. Giannini, senior
vice-president, issued the state
ment that the bank's representa
tives acted on the advice of A. P.
Giannini who felt "Ethical require
ments are waived because of the
unethical practices tljat have been
pursued in openly violating clear
ing house agreements."
Cash Certificates
; "Interim cash certificates" were
used by -the Standard Oil Company
to pay its employees. The certifi
cates ranging in value—sl, $5, $10 —
are redeemable in the San Francisco
office of the concern.
Bank restrictions ranged in de
grees of intensity from Florida's
edict; "Withdrawal restricted to ;>
per cent plus .$lO until March 8"
to the Montana ultimatum, "Closed
until further notice."
Southern California bankers have
hinted that while the holiday was
called to stem Eastern withdrawals,
a silent run has been in progress for
weeks.
