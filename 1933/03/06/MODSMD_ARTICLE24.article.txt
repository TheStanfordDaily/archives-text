# Treasury Secretary Says Ruling Does Not Hurt Gold Standard
## CALL EXTRA CONGRESS Banks May Get Permit To Function As Usual 
### 
WASHINGTON. March 5 {A') â€”
Dramatically clothing himself with
wartime authority, President
Roosevelt tonight proclaimed a
four-day national bank holiday
and took full command of thr ra
tion's currency.
In a sweeping proclamation the
new chicf-executive ordered an
embargo on exports of gold and
silver and prohibited the earmark
ing of American gold for foreign
accounts. In addition the procla
mation authorized the issuance of
clearing house certificates to pro
vide a medium of exchange with
which business can function dur
ing the holiday.
Hardly had Mr. Roosevelt's pro
clamation been issued when the
question arose whether the nation
had departed from the gold stand
ard. The proclamation was widely
interpreted as having that effect.
Gold Standard Holds
Secretary of the Treasury Woodin,
however, was quick and emphatic in
denying such was the case.
Returning from worship early in
the afternoon the President sum
moned his cabinet into its first meet
ing and then called congressional
leaders of both parties into consul
tation.
There followed a proclamation
convening congress into special
session Thursday at noon. The
holiday overlaps the convening of
congress by a few hours.
Meanwhile Mr. Roosevelt's plans
to perfect a program of legislative
action to meet the situation and if it
cannot be enacted by Friday morn
ing the holiday can be extended.
World Leaders Confer
While the events were happening
at the White House, banking leaders
from great centers of commerce were
in conference with the federal re
serve board. The purpose of the
gathering was to prepare machinery
for the issuance of the clearing
house certificates.
The President's proclamation be
gan with a summary of present con
ditions in banks noting "heavy and
widespread withdrawals of gold and
currency from our banking institu
tions for purpose of hoarding
abroad in foreign exchanges" which,
he added, has resulted "in severe
drains on the nation's stock of gold."
