# The
						"Forgotten Student" Laments the Lost Art of Teaching
## 
### 
To the prospective Stanford student, who thumbs his
copies of the various bulletins and dreams of the day when
lie will he a Stanford man, the University beckons as a
parade of big names. The matriculating freshman visions
a great round table of education, where he will sit with the
"leaders in their lie Ids" and obtain from them, first-hand,
Ihe facts and philosophies of life and living. That is the
Stanford which old gratis have pictured for the entering
student.
If the freshman finds another picture it is not the fault
of the old grad who painted the Stanford scene as he had
known it, for theory and fashions change, it seems, with
time and fortune, even in education.
Tradition tells us that in 1<S!)1 the beloved Dr. Jordan
gathered about him a group of brilliant young scholars
who should form the lirst faculty of Stanford University.
Campus lore goes a step farther and insists that those men
were selected not alone for their scholarly brilliance, but
for their ability as teachers. The University ideal was, in
those days, directed toward the education of Ihe student.
What of the Stanford ideal today? It doesn't take the
student long lo discover that the big names, the leaders
in their fields, do very little teaching. Generally speaking,
Ihe highest paid professors, Ihe ones whose names recom
mend Stanford as a top-notch educational center, devote
Ihe great share of their time to research and experimenta
tion. Once in a while they take time out from (licit* indi
vidual study or administrative duties lo give lecture
courses for undergraduates. Then, generally speaking
again, Ihe student discovers that his nationally respected
professor is a bore, either because Ihe expert was not cut
out for a teacher in the lirst place, or because lie regards
his class-room lectures as mere bothersome interludes.
There is a great deal lo be said in defense of the pro
fessorial arrangement at Stanford, which places so high a
premium upon men with imposing scholarly records, or
with great scientific achievement brewing just below the
hairline. .Most logical of all the arguments which defend
Ihe system is the one thai a professor must devote his time
to his subject in order lo keep apace with continual de
velopment within Ihe field. Kven that argument, however,
does not spell justification lo the mind of the student.
The present Stanford undergraduate feels that he is the
"forgotten man,"' that the art of teaching is the most neg
lected in Ihe I Diversity's educational program. He hears
one ("it Ihe "smartest men at Stanford" drone dully through
a lecture hour and wonders whether his University is all
that it is cracked up lo be. He even ventures to suggest that
were the trustees, or Ihe president, or somebody, to sit
through some of Ihe classes which a major'-subject cur
riculum prescribes, that there might he some changes
made.
