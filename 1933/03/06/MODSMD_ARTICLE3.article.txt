# Indian Boxers Lose To Aggies
## Bad Decision Causes Cards To Lose, 5 To 4 
### 
Because James "Happy" Apper
son Wc s awarded a decision over
; Waldo Munday, Stanford's boxers
lost to fie California Aggies, 6-5, at
Davis Bfiday night. This unfortunate
"home town" verdict marred an
otherwii fine card of bouts which
1 feature Ithe brilliant debut of Keith
Toppin a easy victories scored by
Jim Fey. Newt Ridley, and O.scar
Baer, <â€¢ |id the first 1933 defeat of
Captair .Fred Glover.
.Stagi $g one of the best fights of
his CEfeer, junior middleweight
Munday won the first two rounds
from Apperson by a large margin,
knocking the Aggie boxer down for
an eight count in the second round.
The third round was very close, but
went to Munday by a shade. When
A1 Sandell cast his ballot for Apper
son, Referee Harry Atwood, a local
i product, gave Apperson the deciding
vote.
Topping Excellent
Boxing beautifully, Keith Topping
left-handed his way to an easy de
cision over Gilbert Borba, Aggie
veteran. Although still lacking the
necessary condition to keep at top
speed for three rounds, Topping
made an even better impression than
he did in winning the novice tourna
ment last fall.
Still the best of the Stanford
fighters, featherweight Jim Feely
remained undefeated by winning
1 over a devilish looking Filipino, De
La Cruz. The first round was even,
but Feely landed three fine straight
lefts without return to take the sec
cnd canto. The Stanford boxer's
deadly counter-punching took its
toll during the third session and
earned him a unanimous decision.
Ridley Wins
Another good counter-puncher,
Newt Ridley, outboxed Merle Evans
of Davis, while hard-hitting Oscar
Baer scored the other Stanford vic
tory when he gave Ed Haherly, Ag
gie junior middleweight, an artistic
lacing.
Captain Clinton Jewett's sur
prising victory over the Stanford
captain, reversing a previous de
) cision won by Glover, was ham
mered out in convincing fashion.
The Indian leader was floored at
the end of the second round, the
gong interrupting the count at "8."
Glover was waiting until "9," and
would have had no trouble getting
up.
Lightweight John Huston, who
came back nicely in the third, wel
terweight Bob Quinn (a last-minute
substitute), and lanky John Fowler
turned in fine losing battles against
more-experienced Aggie opponents.
Homer Ross, Stanford junior mid
, dleweight, fought a courageous bat
| tie against Carl Rogers in the first
j bout of his career. No decision was
: given.
