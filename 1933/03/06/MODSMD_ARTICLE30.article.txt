# BULL SESSION
## AN EXPANDING HOLIDAY 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
The bank situation has become a
1 situation without banks. But no one
seems worried. Of course, if every
one were in a fever, I would prob
ably bemoan the heat. Just the
! same, it does seem mildly peculiar,
| at least, that after a momentary
! flourish of amazement, interest in
the banks has dwindled to nothing. |
With 37 states completely shut up
! and the other 11 in various stages of
| non-openftion, the campus went un
-1 ruffled on its way, present lamenter
j includod.
As the dance music became par
i ticulitrly screechy, I thought of fid
ler Nero. I could see his full-fash
ioned buttocks silhouetted against
Rome's' burning sky. I knew that 1
! was not fiddling and that America
j wasn't burning—and further that
| there bing no fiddles in the first cen- |
i tury, Nero didn't fiddle. Yet some
j how, I felt that there was a laugh—
; maybe even a hollow laugh—in ban
| terjng small talk wjth the financial
! order in total constipation.
I also found that by hook, crook,
or inuendo, it was impossible to turn
anybody's conversation to the sub
ject for more than 15 to 20 seconds,
j I fully realized that there was a
complete incongruity between danc
ing couples and bank moratoriums.
Yet, nevertheless,, one might think
that the latter would create enough
of a stimulus to eifect the former.
But such a thought is wrong.
Perhaps this is a sign of great
stoical fortitude. Perhaps the stu- j -

1 dents are to be commended for
maintaining an internal calm in the
face of external disturbance. After
all, it is highly commendable to face
blackness or, at least, grayness with
u smile and a twinkle of the toes.
To thumb the nose at Fate, slap her
on the back lustily, and ask her to
run the waxed wood in a fast tango
takes nerve.
But I doubt if this is the case. We
don't seem to realize that it's Fate
we're looking at. A smile is only a
simple grin when backed by ignor
ance. And grinning is no indication
of a stoical spirit. We are prosperity
children. As far back as we remem
ber, it has been sunshine and flow
ers. Depression we know is here:
but it seems unnatural. We don't
know how to react to it. So we don't
react —we just go on as always.

Yet, perhaps it is better to gurgle
on about nothing rather than worry.
After all, there is nothing we can do.
If all 3,000 of us were to sit quietly
and solemnly along the QuacUfrom
sunrise to sunset and do naught but
think banking, it is to state,
"nothing would happen." Barring
the effect of telepathic waves, Rolph
and the Legislature would do ex
actly what they are told to do by
those who are supposed to know. In
fact, I think I will go canoeing im
mediately.
I'll bet Howard Scott is laugh
ing. He prophecied that all would be
crashed in 18 months. Looks like
maybe the Technocrats missed by
only 16 months.
