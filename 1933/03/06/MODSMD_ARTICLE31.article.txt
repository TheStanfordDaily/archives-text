THE SAN FRANCISCO SINFONI
ETTA ORCHESTRA

The San Francisco Sinfonietta Or
chestra, under the direction of
Giulio Minetti, gave its second con
cert in the Veterans' Memorial Aud
itorium last Tuesday. This new or
chestra deserves the attention of
campus people who are interested
in serious music of a more intimate
nature than the Symphony. The full
value of each instrument is manifest
in the ensemble, for there is no
overbalance; and the variety in the
woodwinds is demonstrated by their
group numbers—a Duo for flute and
clarinet; a Terzetto for flute, English
horn, and clarinet; and a Trio for
flute, oboe, and bassoon.
A four movement suite by D.
Scarlatti, which opened the program,
but also for the vitality of the com
position itself. The suite was not in

■ i the ordinary dance tempo which we
expect of eighteenth-century music, j
but in actual movements, of which
f the Watteau-like pastorale and Mo- j
liere-like scherzo were the best.
. Carolyn Cone Baldwin demonstrated
. technical ability of fair merit in the
p Mozart Concerto in C minor. The
1 first movement savored too much of
» the metronome, but the second
] movement brought out more of her
t serious feeling without sentimental
j ity. Her few muffed notes could be
> overlooked in her general capability.
Signor Minetti was an unobtru- ;
1 sive, pleasingly exact conductor. He ,
i made no pretense to fireworks, but i
: intelligently preserved the individu- j
ality of his men, many of them mem- j
. bers of the Symphony, while blend- j
, ing them into unified ensemble. The
■ musicians enjoyed playing together,
i ■ especially in ihe Mendelssohn Oc

tette for fourteen strings.
This program was better than the
first one, and tho announcement for
tomorrow's concert promises an
other evening of good music with a
Beethoven Septette as the climax.
