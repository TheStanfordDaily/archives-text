DICK BELL shocked Alpha O's
and friends at the Saturday night
formal when he put in a belated
appearance wearing tuxedo, vest,
etc. . . . MINUS the buttons on the
vest. . . . THE STORY TOLD is to
the effect that the garment in ques
tion returned from the cleaners
without the necessary implements
. . . too late to do anything about it
. . . so Bell, Encina frosh and Kappa
Sig pledge, came to the hop ingeni
ously bedecked with safety pins . . .
A VERY PROMINENT campus
woman .... interested in the "art
for art's sake" side of the great
game called poker . . . intends to
sponsor an inter-Hall-and-House
poker contest. . . . Scoring by
points only .... no cash with an
all-University title to the winner.
. . . The good old Poker Trust is
griped at the competition but all
applicants and entrants are re
quested to write in to Box 217(Â»
.... today ....
AND TWO members of Mr. Hel
venston's class in Advanced Acting
. . . required to review the "Enemy
of the People" .... broke and with
out cash, etc walked into the
Assembly Hall before 7 o'clock Fri
day evening .... hid in the projec
tion booth until the show was ready
to start .... and then walked out
and took good seats .... ASK THE
CHI PSI'S who the culprits might
be ... .
