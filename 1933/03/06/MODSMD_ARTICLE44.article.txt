# Frosh Ball Team Loses, 8-7, To Roosevelt High
## 
### 
By allowing the opposition to tally
once in the last of the seventh,
Stanford's frosh baseballers dropped
tin 8 to 7 decision to a Boosevelt
High nine Saturday morning on the
yearling diamond. The frosh were
outhit, 11 to 10, by the Oakland
boys, but received consolation from
Iho fact that they made one less
error than did the invaders.
Blanchard started on the mound
for the Babes but was relieved in
the fourth by Franehosci; neither
proved very effective.
Leading in the slugging depart
ment were Hamilton with a single
and double, Moscrip with a triple
and Galbraith and Marshall, who
bagged two singles apiece.
