# Farm To Hear Ballad Recital
## Song Interpreter To Give "Frankie And Johnny" 
### 
Free entertainment of the kind
Stanford enjoys. That is the bill of
fered for the financially-embar
rassed at 7:30 o'clock tomorrow eve
ning in the Assembly Hall. The man
who recorded that popular ditty,
"Frankie and Johnny," and who
kept alive the song, "The Dying
Cowboy," will talk on "Some Types
of the American Ballad," giving
examples.
The man is John A. Lomax,
student, collector, and interpreter
of American ballads, who was for
three years Sheldon Fellow for
the Investigation of American Bal
lads at Harvard University.
Lomax has gone to the sources for
the songs he has collected. From the
tange of his native Texas, Lomax
brings cowboy songs "discovered"
by himself, some published, many
unpublished. Stanford students, fa
miliar with music of the Southwest,
sing "Whoopee-to-yi-yo, git along,
little dogies," and "The Old Chis
holm Trail" without knowing that
this man is responsible for putting
the ballads into print.
Plan Reception
Lomax has gathered songs in the
East, from the Erie wanal boatman
and in the South some from the cot
ton fields.
In a communication to the Public
Exercises Committee, Lomax ex
pressed a desire to meet students in
tersted in folk music. To afford him
such an opportunity, the A.W.S.
Guest Committee is sponsoring an
informal gathering in the Women's
Clubhouse following the lecture.
Betty Watson, chairman of the
group, announced that coffee will be
served.
