# LUPPEN, ROBB STAR AS CARD POLO TEAM TRIMS SAN MATEO, 6 TO 4
## 
### CHARLES CHAPPELL 
Showing rapid improvement, both
individually and as a team, Stan
ford's comparatively inexperienced
poloists defeated the more-seasoned
San Mateo Club riders by a 6 to 4
score Saturday afternoon in a match
played on the Highway field.
Spotted four goals to make up for
the greater experience of the San
Mateo four, Captain Dick Gordan's
horsemen found this margin more
than sufficient to give them the vic
tory in what turned out to be a
closely-played, hard-fought game.
Despite the multi-ringed circus
competition of track, baseball, and
tennis, a sizeable gallery was on
hand as Lupe Luppen and Pat Robb
turned in the two best games of the
day for Stanford. Considering that
Saturday's game was his first com
petition, Robb's performance is espe
cially noteworthy. Wood Melone and

Johnny Myers held clown the two
remaining positions on the Stanford
quartet.
Charley McCormick and Jack
Bradley, formerly members of the
Yale national championship team of
1930, were outstanding for San
Mateo. Pete Lewis, of last year's
Stanford team, and Jeff Armsby
completed the Club four.
