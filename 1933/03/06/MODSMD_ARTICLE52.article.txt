# '36 TRACKMEN POWERFUL IN WIN FROM ALL-STARS
## 
### JOHN KLINE 
Showing surprising strength and
some unexpected talent, the frosh
trackmen smothered the Alameda
All-Stars under a 83 1-6 to 39 5-(i
score. Clean sweeps in the 100, 440,
and shot accounted for 27 of the
points. In five more events only one
Alameda man was allowed a second
or third. All but three events, the
high and broad jumps, and the 880,
were won by the Papooses.
In a 10- Hat 100-yard dash,
Bobby Grayson, pride of Dink
Tenipleton, won from Sam Klop
stock by a hair's-breadlh. Bron
stein made it an all-Stanford
event.
Lloyd Davis won a 52.2 quarter
mile. Near the finish Mackenzie was
holding second for the frosh. Del
linger started a powerful sprint from
fifth place and nosed him out in the
last few yards.
Huntington Kingsbury came home
first in both hurdle events. With 15.1
in the highs and 24.4 in the lows, he
has shown himself a splendid pros
pect for varsity competition in the
future. Klopstock was a yard behind
in the highs and lows to nab seconds.
In the weights, the frosh were
strong, as usual. Leedy, with 120
feet, 11 inches, won the discus; Rey
nolds trailing by lour feet; Hudson
three feet further to the rear. Cal
loway, often second to Reynolds in
the 16-pound shot, proved himself
superior in the 12-pound, which is
the regular high-school weight. His
winning distance, 49 feet, 9 inches,
was 5 inches better than Reynolds'
best throw.
Nimmo, consistently improving
star, led the milers by over 100
yards, to win with a speedy 4:28.6.
He did not run the half, in which
Beckett was the only Stanford
man to place, following two East
Bay men.
Hartmann was a surprise winner
for the frosh in the 220. Grayson and
Klopstock did not run. The time

was only fair—23.2 seconds. Another
surprise winner was Wilson in the
javelin, where his exceedingly me
diocre 130'4" inches was good for a
first.
Chuck Jonas pole-vaulted his cus
tomary 12 feet to win. Ginn tied
|
Mercun of the Stars for second.
Nobs, Cottrell, and Jones failed to
beat Raymond of Alameda in the
high jump. He won at 5'9". Williams,
also of the Alameda squad, beat out
Jones to tie for second with the two
other frosh men.
