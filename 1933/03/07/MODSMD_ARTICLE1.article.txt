# CARD MATMEN MEET BEARS IN BERKELEY GYM
## Wrestlers Will Tangle Next Month Across Bay In Mat Renewal APRIL 7 SET AS DATE Wrestling To Be Featured After Light Years 
### 
For the first time in more than
eight years Stanford wrestlers will
meet California in intercollegiate
competition when Coach Ted Hill's
matmen tangle with the Bear grap
plers April 7 in the Berkeley gym
nasium. The resuming of this sport
will be one of the features of the
Minor Sports Carnival to take place
on the California campus April 7
and 8.
Thrqjr Schools Compete
Wrestlers from California, U.C.L.A.,
and Stanford will compete for titles
in seven weights ranging from 125
pounds to unlimited. Coach Hill said
yesterday that he hoped to enter
men in ail seven classes. However he
would only enter those that he con
sidered good enough for first-class
competition.
Although (bis meet does not
necessarily mean the continuance
of intercollegiate wrestling be
tween Stanford and California, it
is probable that contests between
the two schools will be planned in
the future.
Training Hard
With the University tournament
just passed, the outstanding grap
plers in each weight are ti'uining
hard in preparation for the coming
encounter. In the unlimited class
Bernard Hutsinpiller, University
champion, and Angello May are the
outstanding prospects. Hugh Powers
i-nd Bill Minnetti is favored in the
185-pound division.
The 155-pound group includes
several first-class wrestlers headed
by Len Youdall, Bill Yeomans, and
Grant Hitchcox. Dave Cooke and
Bud Sophian look good among the
145-pounders. Ron Morey and Ha
mer Budge are both potential en
trants in the 135-pound class. Jake
Butts, probably the best wrestler in
Stanford, is recovering from a
sprained ankle and should be in
shape for the Cal meet. He will fight
in the 145- or 355-pound division.
