dance, if banks are still closed, it j
was announced last night. Further, j
the scene of the affair has been !
moved from the women's gym to the j
Pavilion.
After a session with Student Man
ager Charley Karl yesterday after
noon, Dick Van Wagenen. Glee Club
president, announced, "Admittedly I
we are taking a risk in the whole j
matter, but with the prospect of ;
very few students wandering far |
afield this week-end, we expect the j
impoverished masses to support the
dance in force."
Compensating for the shift of lo
cale is the addition of two pieces to j
the orchestra; A1 Rushton's nine- |
p/tce Royal Cardinals, plus prob
ably the orchestra's vocal trio, will 1
be on hand from 9 to 1 o'clock.

Prices as formerly announced will j
prevail. Couples will be admitted for j
fifty cents, single roughs for fifty, |
and unescorted women for fifteen j
cents. Any of these tickets may be j
