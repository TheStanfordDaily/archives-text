### 
Returning to Stanford for his
third engagement, John A. Lomax
will interpret '"Some Type* of the
American Ballad" at 7:30 olclock to
night in the Assembly Hall.
The program will include negro
ballads, spirituals, and songs of the
range. Mr. Lomax has suggested the
audience will be asked to join in
and sing some of the better-known
tunes.
Author of "Cowboy Songs and
Other Frontier Ballads," Mr. Lomax
will tell about several songs from
this collection that have become well
known. He will also include ma
terial which has not appeared in
print.
Lomax has obtained ballads from
their sources. One of his principal
instruments in collecting was a port
able recording phonograph which he
declares "I must have carried it a
thousand miles." With it he has
stalked negroes singing in the field
and captured the songs of the bronco
busters at Texas rodeos.
