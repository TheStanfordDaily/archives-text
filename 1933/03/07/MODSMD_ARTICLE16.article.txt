! Will Stanford women be denied
a chance at campus dramatics
; spring quarter?
I
This is the potent question that \
' Student Manager Charles Karl will j
i toss into the laps of Ex Committee |
! members tonight when he attempts j
I to secure action on this verbal bomb- j
I shell let loose at yesterday after- 1
j noon's "secret" surprise meeting of j
j that body.
Members of the dramatic coun- I
cil, it was learned by the Daily
last night, were to met yesterday
for selection of the first production j
of the spring quarter. In the mean- j
time, a special meeting of the Ex j
Committee was called for the same
j time, to sit in conjunction with
the former body and decide this
important question.
Dramatic interests were not in
formed of this action in order that
they might be prepared to answer!
, any questions on their productions. |
Instead of the expected selection i
j one which was expected to have j
and approval of a new production—j
surpassed "Holiday" as a financial
[ and dramatic success — Dramatic
| Council members found themselces
confronted with a proposition to
abolish the only stage presentation
left for campus women to participate
| in this college year.
Reasons advanced by Karl for his !
! proposition emphasized the financial I
losses of the "Enemy of the People," (
which the council countered by |
showing that the production was j
i held immediately following the dec- J
i laration of a bank holiday and a j
I good deal of negative publicity; also
j because of a production in Palo Alto.
The Council's choice for presentation I
in April is claimed to be one of the
best in recent years not only for i
popular box-office appeal, but for
real dramatic qualities.
I Tonight the Ex Committee will be
asked by Karl to take definite ac- j
t ion on this matter.
