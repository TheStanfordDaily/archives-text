## 
### Paul Zulch 
Alleged irregularities concerning
j Columbia University football were
' aired recently when a committee of
[students, alumni and faculty mem-
I bers, recently filed a report with
President Nicholas Murray Butler.
Three points of favoritism were
I spiked and three more substantiated.
| Charges found valid were: 1—
Proselyting of athletes by the Ath
j letic Association and by "friends"
lof the University. 2—Favoritism in
j the allotment of jobs to football
| players by the Department of Build
ing and Grounds. 3—The "high"' sal
ary of the football coach as com
. pared with the remuneration of aca
j demic instructors.
Charges of favoritism in admission
j of athletes, leniency of instructors in
| giving marks to grid players, or par
tiality of the Bureau of Appoint
ments in allotment of jobs were
blasted,

Nineteen witnesses, including
prominent university officials and
football players, were called before
the seven-man committee.
A 10-point recommendation clause
was signed by five of the commit
teemen. Foremost in the suggestions
was: " —that those in charge of
Columbia's schedules come to an
understanding with other colleges
and universities so that hours of
training will be cut to a minimum
necessary for safe playing of foot
ball."
Scholastic records were considered
when the report suggested that eli
gibility be granted only on passing
of 12 units of credit for the previous
term and an average of 12 points
for all previous college terms.
Investigation grew from vigorous
charges against football made in the
columns of the Columbia Daily
Spectator, student daily.
