# Treasury Heads May Issue Currency Substitutes During Holiday
## CHIEF SPEEDS ACTION New Plan Drawn To Meet Demands For Payrolls 
### 
WASHINGTON, March (i (A 1 )â€” In
a day reminiscent of war-time
activity, President Roosevelt and
his aids today sped their efforts to
give the bankless citizenry a me
dium of exchange during the holi
day and bring about an early
opening of the closed bank vaults
on a secure basis.
Expressions of confidence aris
ing from the Nation spurred Mr.
Roosevelt to unceasing action and
progress reports came from the
almost endless series of White
House conferences.
Secretary Woodin and his Treas
ury assistants also were working
hard on the creation of machinery
for issuance of the clearing house
certificates that are to substitute for
currency during the respite. The
PostofTice Department announced
that postal savings banks would be
continued in full operation.
Secretary Woodin late in the day
announced six banking functions
permitted under the banking holi
day, as follows:
Handling of drafts for shipment,
transportation, and delivery of
foodstuffs.
Free access of customers to
safety deposit vaults.
Making change, but without
paying out either gold or gold cer
tificates.
Cashing checks drawn on the
Treasurer of the United States, but
not in gold or gold certificates.
Returning without restriction all
cash, checks, etc., received for de
posit or collection after the last
closing of business hours and not
then entered on the books.
Accepting in cash or otherwise
payments on account of notes or
other obligations due the banks.
This six-point program was to as
sure that payrolls would be met and
that food would be available every
where.
