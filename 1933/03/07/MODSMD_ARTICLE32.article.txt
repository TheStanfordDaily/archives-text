# Bank Holiday Shows Roosevelt to be Man of Deeds
## 
### 
Roosevelt seems rendv to hack up his words with deeds.
The new President's step in taking upon himself the powers
of a war-time executive and declaring a national hank
holiday is far more drastic than any since the day of Wood
row Wilson. /
Whether or not the step is in the right direction is open
to question even professors of economics do not agree on
this point. One thing looks sure, howeverâ€”Roosevelt evi
dentaly intends to hack up his inaugural attack on the
"money changers."
The new President conducted his campaign in a way
which caused some to doubt his ability and strength of
purpose. His speeches on the whole seemed splendid ex
amples of a politician's ability to gain votes by saying little
at great length. Mis inaugural address, on the other hand,
was a source of great surprise and pleasure to the doubt
ers. His attack on the very questionable tactics of modern
hankers brought visions of another and earlier Roosevelt.
The doubters then began to wonder if President Roose
velt had the force to follow up his declaration with action.
The bank holiday is a conclusive answer.
One sad note, however, spoils the effect. Hoover had
made very definite steps toward the same goal for which
Roosevelt is preaching. His plan, had it not been rendered
impotent by the last stubborn lame-duck congress, might
have avoided the necessity of the holiday.
Now that it has come we rnav at least expect immediate
and drastic action from a president and congress, fortu
nately both of the same party.
