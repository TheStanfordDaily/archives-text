# Comic Opera Warfareâ€” An Oriental Radio Innovation
## 
### 
Comic-opera warfare still persists in the Orient, with
neither Chinese nor Japanese statesmen admitting that a
slate of warfare actually exists, .lust how the C.hinese hosts
can afford to ignore a war in which the Nipponese invaders
are reported to have seized all save one of the passages
through the Great Wall itself remains somewhat of a
mystery.
The oddities of Oriental nomenclature for cities, prov
inces. and generals succeed in cloaking the actual proceed
ings in .lehol (pronounced Ray-hole by up-to-the-minute
radio reporters) in a haze of uncertainty for the American
newspaper reader. Even the sound news reels are un
reliable, according to a story which drifts northward from
the California film capital. It seems that one of the big
studios collected some two-score of the unemployed Los
Angeles Japanese, dressed them in fairly authentic uni
forms, and turned them loose before news reel cameras on
a muddy section of the lot to stage an advance on Jehol, at
live dollars a day. The "latest pictures from the Eastern
battlcfront," however, proved a pretty costly item at the
studio, for the directors experienced some difliculty in
getting their invaders to charge and fire at the expected
moments.
Meanwhile, in the East itself, the conflict has been given
ils light-opera tone by a series of Japanese "direct from
the front" chain radio broadcasts. Wives and relatives at
home in Tokyo are reported to be receiving ".just before the
battle" predictions from their nation's generals, through the
courtesy of the Saki Distilleries, Incorporated, or the Fuji
yama Tea Company.
Of course there is a great deal of actual fighting going
on in Jehol. but the outcome seems pretty certain to be n
victory for Japan. When all the Japanese objectives are
achieved and the last gun is fired, however, it will prove
,i hollow victory, for big, complacent China will probably
never realize that it has been conquered.
