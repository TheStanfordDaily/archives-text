### ABE MELLINKOFF 
Those with imaginations become
imaginative during exciting times.
Any number of people are now run
ning off at the cerebrum. Three have !
confided in me their pet plan to
weather the trials and tribulations
that may come. Singularly enough,
all three are about the same. They
all start with a general sunset haze
in the High Sierras. A cabin takes
shape beneath the str.tely pines.
The plan is to flee from civiliza- I
tion — civilization, with speeding
autos, bank holidays, and impending
term-papers —not to mention finals
over the hill. The willing exile plans
to supply himself with books—plen
ty and the best. On probing him
further, it develops that a radio and
phonograph are requisite.
Economics will be simple—a com
bination pastoral, agrarian, and
hunting existence. Then, his bosom
heaves as he pictures himself in
boots and deerskin stalking through
the cool woods —trusty rifle on arm, j
and loyal dog at heel. There is a
small green meadow—there always
is—with two prize-winning Holsteins
munching away in pastoral peace.
Vegetables are there—just enough j
of a variety for a well-diversified
diet. Oh yes—a stream, with the
largest, juiciest trout—large tears
pouring out of their green eyes. They
want your hook to hang on.
This far, the off-to-the-Sierraist
will take himself. But probed, he
wants a partner for ping-pong.
Pressed further, he wants a four- I

some for bridge. Suggest a full moon
l effected in the still lake—and he is
sure he planned (all the time of
course) a beautiful creature to rest
her silken head against his primeval
bosom.
In fact, I finally wheedled one of
these Me-For-The-Hills boys to a
fairly decent society of ,25 couples.
In time, I could have had the entire
Peninsula transferred to some myth
ical valley in the Sierras. And if we
go that far, it is obviously much
easier to stay where we are.

These people don't want a sched
uled cabin in the woods; they want
a Valhalla on earth—not a new idea
at all. To scratch a miserable exist
ence out of the Sierras is slavish
work. To chop enough wood to keep
warm during the winter is no mean
task in itself. After a day at hoeing
beans and potatoes, no one wants to
read anything—not even by electric
light; and if forced, tired or fresh,
to read by a flickering lamp that
smells like a Model T exhaust, I
should choose illiteracy.
Hunting is sport, but as a means
of satisfying the urge to eat, it is a
total washout. Look as much like
Daniel Boone as you care to, the
bears and deer never come within
sight. If they did, it is difficult to
say who would be more amazed, the
hunter or the hunted. And if every
thing panned out splendidly, the
j water supply would become infected
| by the cow dung, and the whole
colony would be flat on its back with
typhoid. Those that survived would
struggle back to the Coast as fast
as strength permitted.
We are machine-age creatures —
like it or not. We can't run. We must
stick and sing with the machine—or
sink with it.
