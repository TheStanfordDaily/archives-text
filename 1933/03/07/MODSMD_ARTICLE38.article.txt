TOPAZE < Hatiio) —At the Stanford i
Theatre. s
John Barrymore considers his 4
brother Lionel to be the greatest j 4
actor of the day. While Lionel is £
certainly a master of stago trickery N
and has blended successfully the 1
histrionic art of the last century
with the realistic style of this, he (
seems to me, less fine an actor than '
is John.
And I have never oeen John, 1
equally a master in the less spec- '
tacular if more difficult and ad
mirable art of quiet, suggestive 1
playing, better than he is in Topaze. '
He has created the character of the
placid, credulous schoolmaster with :
all of his skill in the comic, and ac
complished the metamorphosis from
idealist into suave gentleman with
exquisite artistry.
This change, one of the most dif
ficult problems of the stage play,
had to be accomplished chiefly be
tween acts. On the screen, aided
immensely by the ease of scene (
change and the possibility of re
cording slight facial movements not
, apparent lrom a stage, it realizes the
astonishment of the idealist, his hor-
I ror at his innocent misdeeds, and
his cynical reflection upon the ways
of a world not governed by school
' room precepts.
The role is a fine one; Barrymore
does not play with or above it as he
has frequently been forced to in the
past. And while his performance in
"A Bill of Divorcement" was indica
tive of his considerable ability in
serious drama, this pathetic, amusing
figure of Topaze shows him to im
-1 mensely better advantage.
The ending has been modified in
what may seem a sentimental com
pliance to cinematic demand. On the
other hand, that the completely 1
idealistic schoolmaster should be
come within an act on the stage, so
utterly the man of the world, the
grafting politician, is faintly dis
-1 turbing and unbelievable.

The reappearance of Topaze in his
schoolroom from which, for his hon
esty, he has been dismissed, and his
assertion that honesty, once at least, ,
shall triumph, is completely in tone
with the character and an improve
ment upon the play.
Space forbids more than mention
of Myrna Loy, allowed to modifying
an exciting sinuousness with some
sympathetic humanness, Reginald
Mason, and Frank Reicher—mem
bers of a fine supporting cast.
Harry Browne has booked, in ad
dition, a highly diverting colored
Silly Symphony, Babes in the
Woods, and a Laurel and Hardy
short. —Sandoe
Till: HALF NAKFI) TRUTH (War
ers) At the California Theatre.
This is the story of the rise to
Broadway fame of a couple of small
time circus performers through the
wise-cracking ability of a small
time press agent with big ideas.
Lee Tracy, although cast a bit dif
ferently this time than before, is the
same vaudeville character, using his
stereotyped style to put over a bunch
of new and fairly good gags.
Amusing comedy is the result of
heavy over-playing.
The situation is new, the charac
ters are old, the wise-cracks are
funny, and the whole thing is en
tertaining. —Graves

This is the story of the rise to
Broadway fame of a couple of small
time circus performers through the
wise-cracking ability of a small
time press agent with big ideas.
Lee Tracy, although cast a bit dif
ferently this time than before, is the
same vaudeville character, using his
stereotyped style to put over a bunch
of new and fairly good gags.
Amusing comedy is the result of
heavy over-playing.
The situation is new, the charac

funny, and the whole thing is en
tertaining. —Graves
TOPAZE < Hatiio) —At the Stanford i

John Barrymore considers his 4
brother Lionel to be the greatest j 4
actor of the day. While Lionel is £
certainly a master of stago trickery N
and has blended successfully the 1
histrionic art of the last century
with the realistic style of this, he (
seems to me, less fine an actor than '
is John.
And I have never oeen John, 1
equally a master in the less spec- '
tacular if more difficult and ad
mirable art of quiet, suggestive 1
playing, better than he is in Topaze. '
He has created the character of the
placid, credulous schoolmaster with :
all of his skill in the comic, and ac
complished the metamorphosis from
idealist into suave gentleman with
exquisite artistry.
This change, one of the most dif
ficult problems of the stage play,
had to be accomplished chiefly be
tween acts. On the screen, aided
immensely by the ease of scene (
change and the possibility of re
cording slight facial movements not
, apparent lrom a stage, it realizes the
astonishment of the idealist, his hor-
I ror at his innocent misdeeds, and
his cynical reflection upon the ways
of a world not governed by school
' room precepts.
The role is a fine one; Barrymore
does not play with or above it as he
has frequently been forced to in the
past. And while his performance in
"A Bill of Divorcement" was indica
tive of his considerable ability in
serious drama, this pathetic, amusing
figure of Topaze shows him to im
-1 mensely better advantage.
The ending has been modified in
what may seem a sentimental com
pliance to cinematic demand. On the
other hand, that the completely 1
idealistic schoolmaster should be
come within an act on the stage, so
utterly the man of the world, the
grafting politician, is faintly dis
-1 turbing and unbelievable.

The reappearance of Topaze in his
schoolroom from which, for his hon
esty, he has been dismissed, and his
assertion that honesty, once at least, ,
shall triumph, is completely in tone
with the character and an improve
ment upon the play.
Space forbids more than mention
of Myrna Loy, allowed to modifying
an exciting sinuousness with some
sympathetic humanness, Reginald
Mason, and Frank Reicher—mem
bers of a fine supporting cast.
