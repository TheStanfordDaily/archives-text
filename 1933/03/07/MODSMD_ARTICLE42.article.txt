Hoary, frosted tradition, descend

super-stupendous super-production,
stipulates that, if I were writing this
column the Tuesday after the open
ing track meet or the season, I
should dedicate it to the brilliance
of Ben Eastman.
For Eastman who, when once
introduced to a freshman woman
at a jolly-up, elicited the thrilled j
trill, "Oh, this is like meeting I
God," is entering his third year |
as the best sports news in the
country. It would therefore be fil
ling, as well as traditional, that if
I were writing this column today,
I should rhapsodize concerning
the Stanford track captain's 21.4
220 last Saturday, and subordinate
the remainder of (he track per
formances to the third and suc
ceeding paragraphs.
But, of course, if f were writing
this column today, I would not be
such a slave to custom's and jour
nalism's dictates. I would mention l
Johnny Mottram's 196-foot javelin
toss first, as I plan to .spend my
spring vacation in Los Angeles and
1 desire greatly to be able to stand
Southern California students on
their heads with proof of a probable
Stanford track victory over the Tro- j
jans. And even Southern California j
students know that Eastman is good
for two or three firsts whether he i
runs the sprints or the mile and
two-mile.
Mottram's throw, however, might
: tand even Dean Cromwell on his
head, as Johnny is just a sophomore ,
who went out for the javelin mostly
for the exercise and who is already
consistent at beyond 190 feet. And
Otto Herbert's time of 23.7 for the
lows might also create headaches |
down South, as Cotto is supposed
to be j\ist an ordinary or garden
variety of low hurdler and quite in
capable of the champion's time he :
recorded Saturday.

seconds and then finished well in
the 220. And Art Rice, a transfer

from Menlo, must have broken
22-flat while* finishing second to
Eastman (Ben) in the furlong.
I am personally an obstinate cuss
who always forgets that 14 feet is
nothing any more around Stanford
in the pole-vault; in fact, when Dink
Templeton nonchalantly and inci
dentally notified me last week that
Bud Deacon had cleared 14 feet in
practice, I was, in my simple nai've-
J ty, thrilled with it all. Still, if I
were writing this column today and
although it may be nothing, I would
mention that both Deacon and Bill
Miller vaulted 14 feet Saturday.
I would also find it my enjoy
' able duty to notify those who did
1 riot see the track meet that Here
Labordc threw the discus over 157
feet and that Nellie Gray (in an
off-day) tossed the shot nearly 50
feet. Nor could sophomore Lloyd
Schween's (i feet 1 inch leap in
the high-jump and Bob Keeble's
inch-less effort be neglected.

did not compete Saturday; and that

with the happy realization that, if
Templeton can find a good broad
jumper and a consistent 9.7 dash
