# Nimmo May Prove Best Miler In Indian History
## 
### 
Already threatening four Little
Big Meet records with the brilliance
of their early season performances,
Hunt Kingsbury and Chuck Nimmo,
the freshman track sensations who
have led the yearlings to two con
secutive wins, promise future varsi
ties the finest miler and one of the
best hurdlers in Stanford history.
Nimmo, small, easy-striding, and
apparently effortless, led the milers
by a quarter-lap Saturday in the
remarkable time of 4:28.6. As a mat
ter of statistical interest, this
eclipsed the winning time in the
varsity mile against SF.U. by nine
seconds and was four seconds faster
than frail Chuck's own best previous
mark.
