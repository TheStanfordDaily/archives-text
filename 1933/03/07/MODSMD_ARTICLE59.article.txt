Here were some of the democratic women who added to brilliance and color of the inaugural ball. Each wore the gown chosen for the
occasion. Left to right: Eleanor Branson and Jeanne Miles of Washington; Elizabeth Wheeler, daughter of Senator Wheeler of Montana; Mrs. Ruth
Bryan Owen, representative from Florida; and Mary Ann Harrison, the (laughter of Senator Harrison of Mississippi. Mrs. Owen modeled her
own gown, which was of black lacquer satin. (A.P. Photos)
