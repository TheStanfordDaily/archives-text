# Stanford Debaters Win Decision Over Convicts
## 
### Dave Mellinkoff 
With a San Quentin edition of
"Hail, Stanford, Hail!" echoing in
j their ears, Leonard Bloom and Ike
| Livermore last Sunday won a 2-1
decision from an all-star prison de-
I bate team in the packed auditorium
| of California's Big House.
After the "Blue-Denim Song
i Birds" had rendered the Farm hymn
I they burst forth with the strains of
| "Sam, The Man From Alabam"—
prison rally song . . . Across the
proscenium was painted in red and
white: WELCOME STANFORD . . .
The hall was crowded to its 300
maximum capacity; more than seven
hundred Quentin debate fans had
been turned away. . . . Included in
| the group of the admitted were col
lege graduates, ditch-diggers, faith -
; less financiers, whites, blacks. . . .
j Til is was I he setting for the first of

I
I a series of annual Big Debates: j
Stanford vs. San Quentin.
Stanford's cancellationists argued |
that "fifty million Frenchmen can't j
be wrung." They proved to the sat- !
i isfaction of a majority of the judges j
—newspaper man John Barry; chief j
engineer for the Northwestern Wil- j
liams; and Dr. Stanley, Stanford |
alumnus and prison physician—that i
the time was ripe for a new deal in
war debts.
The prisoners, speaking with high j
polish, contended "that morally, I
ethically, and economically" it was ;
wrong to cancel Europe's debts to
the United States.
Following the debate, the Stan- j
ford orators — along with John i
J Gange, Fred Glover, and Gus Meier J
! —mingled with the men of San (
i Quentin. Said debater Bloom: "The [
.prisoners were very democratic."
