# MRS. MOODY TO GIVE EXHIBITION ON FARM TODAY
## Varsity Courts Scene Of Matches At 2 o'Clock; Admission Free 
### 
Mrs. Helen Wills Moody will play
her first outdoor exhibition matches
in over a year and a half in America
this afternoon at 2 o'clock on the
varsity courts.
Mrs. Moody is bringing with her
a number of sparkling tennis play
ers, who have all enjoyed national
ranking at some time or other, and
campus enthusiasts of fine tennis
play are assured one of the best
programs of exhibition singles,
mixed doubles, and men's doubles
that has ever been presented on the
Stanford vai'sity courts.
No admission charge will be
levied. The Hoard of Athletic Con
trol and A1 Masters were instru
mental in securing this program.
In the first singles match of the
afternoon, Mrs. Moody will take the
courts against Joe Coughlin, left
handed captain of the Stanford var
sity team, and present holder with
Keith Gledhill of the Intercollegiate
Doubles crown.
Following this singles play, Mrs.
Moody will pair with Phil Neer,
former Stanford captain, and also
intercollegiate titleholder, against
Alice Marble and Gerry Stratford
in the mixed doubles.
This will be a two-set match. Miss
Marble is the present state cham
pion as well as being heralded as the
logical successor to Queen Moody's
crown.
Stratford and Marble form a
formidable team, holding the pres
ent Pacific Coast championship.
For some fast and furious tennis,
however, the scheduled Men's
doubles after this match will un
doubtedly be the best net play.
Two members of the Stanford var
sity, Joe Coughlin and Sammy
Lee, will combine to play against
Neer and Stratford.
