Is the United States off the gold
standard? That an affirmative an
swer to this question would seem to
be the practical effect of President
Roosevelt's placing a virtual em
bargo on the shipment of gold, was
revealed yesterday by Professor
Theodore H. Boggs of the economics
department.
Since this change in the status
of the heretofore sacred gold
standard would doubtless lead to
a species of currency inflation, Dr.
Boggs declared that important re
sults would occur if our present
policy is continued for any length
of time.
There would be three prime con
sequences:
(1) WAR DEBTS: Said Boggs—
"Both Great Britain and the United
States would lose strong talking
points at the forthcoming debt con
ference. England would no longer
be able to point to the overwhelm
ing difference in the values of the
British pound and the American
dollar as a reason for partial can
cellation.
"America would no longer be in a
position to offer to scale down the
debt in consideration of England's
return to the gold standard."
(2) TRADE: "The advantage
which England, Japan, and other
countries with depreciated cur
rencies enjoy in being able to un
dersell American producers would
be reduced. United States industry
would derive some benefit."
(3) PRICES: "There would be a
probable general rise in the price
level all over the country if the
policy were continued for a very
long time."
