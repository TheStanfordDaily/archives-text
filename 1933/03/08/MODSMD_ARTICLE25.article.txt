# Clearing Houses May Issue Certificates Subject To Possible U.S. Plan
## STATE ASSEMBLY ACTS F.R. Grips Gold Supply But Plans Quick Opening 
### 
SACRAMENTO, March 7 (/»')—
An urgency bill, permitting banks
to operate under a limited with -
drawal plan, was passed by the
Assembly of the State Legislature
today.
WASHINGTON, March 7 (/P)
The Nation's banks were put on a
restricted operating basis today by
Secretary of the Treasury William
H. Woodin to allow the transaction
of functions necessary to human ex
istence as President Roosevelt and
his Cabinet devised a plan to be
made effective after the holiday.
Conditional authority also was
granted for State and local clear
ing house associations to issue
certificates to be used as scrip
during the period. This was made
subject to substitution of a na
tional scrip plan.
Plans Complete Opening
Keeping a close grip, meanwhile,
on the Nation's gold supply, Presi
dent Roosevelt studied a system for
complete opening in the near future
of the strong banks of the country
and a gradual extension of the plan
to other institutions that prove their
soundness.
Continued support for the Presi
dent in his emergency action was
echoed from Capitol Hill, where
leaders promised quick action
Thursday for whatever he proposes.
The drive in Congress for legisla
tion guaranteeing bank deposits to a
degree gathered momentum.
Every emphasis was given in the
day of bustling activity to making
sure of relief for the people so far
as protection of the gold supply
from hoarders and foreign raiders
would permit.
Woodin Issues Order
Institutions were opened for pay
ments with his broad order:
"Any National or State banking
institution may exercise its usual
banking functions to such extent
as the situation shall permit and
as shall be absolutely necessary to
meet the needs of its community
for food, medicine, other necessi
ties of life, for the relief of dis
tress, for the payment of usual
salaries and wages, for the pur
pose of maintaining employment
and for other similar essential
purposes."
