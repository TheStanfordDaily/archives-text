of Hie I uiversilv, Acting-president Robert K. Swain will
resume his position as head of the department of Chem

on once more in his favorite field.
As acting-president of the (.'diversity Dr. Swain has
handled a diflicult situation with credit to himself and
benefit to his ollice. lie has been faced with all the trials
which such a position must bring without the compensa
tion of any of the glory.
Heading, as lie has, almost a complete college genera

men and women. He has gone his way, quietly and elli

The sacrifice of his chemical career, unexcelled in the
history of the Farm for its unselfishness, is appreciated by
the t niversity.
