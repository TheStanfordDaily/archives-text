# After Four Years' Absence, A University's President Is Welcomed
## 
### 
After nearly four years' absence, Stanford's president
returns to his post on the campus today. He will be wel
comed by undergraduates who have never seen their presi
dent, by a student body which matriculated, matured, and
is now about to graduate, never having known him.
Mul although three thousand miles distant from the
campus, Hav Lyman Wilbur has remained close to the
affairs of the I 'uiversilv. Though the jests concerning the
Wasliinglon-Palo Alio long-distance phone bills are based
more on humor than fact, it is undoubtedly true that many
of (he I niversitv's policies have been determined, many
decisions made, at the ollice of the Secretary of the Inte
rior.
Due to this co-operation between Dr. Swain and Dr.
"Wilbur, the t niversity has remained substantially as it
was in l'.l'JS, still the product to a great extent of Dr. Wil
bur's service since war-time days. As moulder and di
rector of the University's progress, it is Dr. Wilbur who is
responsible for what Stanford is today.
Today, after four years, he returns. The campus wel
comes him.
