Campus wags had this one
turn out better than they ever
hoped for. Last fall before elec
tion some whip figured it out
that all the banks in the coun
try would he closed four
months after the President's
inauguration.
They managed to lay a num
ber of bets on this point, for
main unsuspecting ones didn't
remember that four months af
ter the inauguration would be
the Fourth of July, a "natural"
in bank holidays.
So they've won their bets
now, and four months earlier
than they cxpected. Hut here's
the boomerang—how arc they
going to collect them?
