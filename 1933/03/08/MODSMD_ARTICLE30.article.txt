# A 						Heads-up Ex Committee Chooses Art Over Burlesque
## 
### 
Stanford dramatics, in the purer forms, received an en
couraging vote of confidence last night with the decision
of the Executive Committee to produce but one perform
ance next quarter, that one to be a legitimate stage play
rather than an all-male burlesque.
Feeling that the campus could not possibly support two
dramatic productions during the spring, the Ex Committee
showed line judgment in discarding the scheduled men's
"Hi Jinx" in favor of a play to be selected from successful
Broadw ay comedies of recent date. The Ex Committee un
dertook their problem with a Dramatic Council deficit of
several hundred dollars facing them. From an economic,
box-oflicc outlook, the committee's choice was most likely
judicious, for a play of the legitimate type will certainly
elicit much greater support from off-campus patrons of
Stanford dramatics than would the distinctly local "Hi
.l inx."
From the more important angle of student patronage
of an artistic theatre, the Ex Committee's choice was more
than judicious. II was remarkable. With the newly deter
mined support of the A.S.S.I*. heads, the Dramatic Council
is almost certain to produce a performance next quarter
which will maintain the standard of excellence at Stan
lord. and which w ill show a profit at the box office.
What the younger generation needs is courage and
idealism, suggests Dr. Frank Avdclotte, president of
Swarthmore College. They admire idealism, and they ad
mire nothing more than courage. It seems, however, that
events since tin 4 World War have chased idealism and
courage to places unknown, until if is no longer the younger
generation alone that flounders in a maze of problems too
abstruse, too complex, ;fnd too muddled for the enlighten
ment of and the admiration from a puzzling populace.
"We have been timid," said Dr. Avdclotte, "we have
fried to evade our inevitable share of the responsibility for
the orderly conduct of world affairs, we have contended
for our own interests, narrowly interpreted, and the effect
upon the younger generation has been one of disillusion
ment."
I he active result of it all on the collegian isn't of the
best. He becomes more and more a destructive critic, and
less and less a constructive one, and simply because
he has no way of being sure of* himself. Who cannot criti
cize destructively? Washington Slate. Evergreen.
