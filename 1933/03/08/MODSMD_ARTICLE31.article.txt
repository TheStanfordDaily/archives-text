# BULL SESSION
## DRAMMER IN THE RED 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
There was a time when those
things floating' in the red were the
objects of mercy and attention.
Now, the plan is that everything in
the red, should be submerged and
sunk out of sight. That is why Stu
dent Manager Karl is eager—or was
eager, according to yesterday's pa
per, to cut the Spring Quarter play.
His object is purely financial. His
purpose is noble—of that I feel sure.
But many noble motives are mis
directed; in fact, most of them prob
ably are. That is the great fault with
nobility. Drama is in the red; but
cutting out the Spring Play will not
wash the horrible color off the body
dramatic. It will be admitting defeat
and paying the dramatic debt out of
the student-body funds. That is irk
some as well as costly.
The next play is to be a simple
comedy—one that is sure to click.
It is sure to be a jigger success than
''Holiday" which not only made ex
penses but netted a profit. By allow
| ing the Spring Play, there is a good
possibility of paying off some of the
dramatic deficit. There is a theoreti
cal chance of further deficit; but
' only theoretical when the produc
j tion is to be simple and funny. This
, campus always supports the non
-1 philosophical in dramatics.
That may be a horrible indictment
1 of our taste —but it is an indis
putable fact about our pocket books.
We shell out to be aimised. We go
to Palo Alto when "deep-stuff" is
produced. In those two declarative
I sentenaes lies at once tie sad truth

about Stanford dramatics and the
white hope for the spring play. It
will make money. If it only breaks
even, all is well.
But we are willing to bet Manager
Karl our overstuffed davenport by a
pearly stream against his plugged
nickel that the play will save
drama's face for the year —or at least
make it less shameful financially.
The Dramatic Council NEEDS a
chance. It's hardly fair to stab when
they are flat on their backs. And
that's where they are now. How
ever, if it was sure they would get
flatter, a stabbing might be an act
of kindness—not a cruel murder.
With the realization that the play
must be put over, and with a popu
lar play to put over, we can expect
great action Spring Quarter from
the drama moguls. The Campus will
support the play—out of selfish mo
tives of self-enjoyment. That is the
best type of support upon which to
depend.
Even if Karl's idea were a good
one—which it Is not, I would be
against it. I object to the speed with
which it was hatched and "sprung"
on the campus. Speed is a great
thing on the battlefield but always
grounds for suspicion and opposi
tion in campus affairs. I don'i smell
a rat; I do smell a whippet. No need
for such speed.
Of course Manager Karl may be
starting this just to awaken the
campus to the need of supporting
the play. This is the kindest view.

The next play is to be a simple
comedy—one that is sure to click.
It is sure to be a jigger success than
''Holiday" which not only made ex
penses but netted a profit. By allow
| ing the Spring Play, there is a good
possibility of paying off some of the
dramatic deficit. There is a theoreti
cal chance of further deficit; but
' only theoretical when the produc
j tion is to be simple and funny. This
, campus always supports the non
-1 philosophical in dramatics.
That may be a horrible indictment
1 of our taste —but it is an indis
putable fact about our pocket books.
We shell out to be aimised. We go
to Palo Alto when "deep-stuff" is
produced. In those two declarative
I sentenaes lies at once tie sad truth

about Stanford dramatics and the
white hope for the spring play. It
will make money. If it only breaks
even, all is well.
But we are willing to bet Manager
Karl our overstuffed davenport by a
pearly stream against his plugged
nickel that the play will save
drama's face for the year —or at least
make it less shameful financially.
The Dramatic Council NEEDS a
chance. It's hardly fair to stab when
they are flat on their backs. And
that's where they are now. How
ever, if it was sure they would get
flatter, a stabbing might be an act
of kindness—not a cruel murder.
With the realization that the play
must be put over, and with a popu
lar play to put over, we can expect
great action Spring Quarter from
the drama moguls. The Campus will
support the play—out of selfish mo
tives of self-enjoyment. That is the
best type of support upon which to
depend.
Even if Karl's idea were a good
one—which it Is not, I would be
against it. I object to the speed with
which it was hatched and "sprung"
on the campus. Speed is a great
thing on the battlefield but always
grounds for suspicion and opposi
tion in campus affairs. I don'i smell
a rat; I do smell a whippet. No need
for such speed.
Of course Manager Karl may be
starting this just to awaken the
campus to the need of supporting
the play. This is the kindest view.
There was a time when those
things floating' in the red were the
objects of mercy and attention.
Now, the plan is that everything in
the red, should be submerged and
sunk out of sight. That is why Stu
dent Manager Karl is eager—or was
eager, according to yesterday's pa
per, to cut the Spring Quarter play.
His object is purely financial. His
purpose is noble—of that I feel sure.
But many noble motives are mis
directed; in fact, most of them prob
ably are. That is the great fault with
nobility. Drama is in the red; but
cutting out the Spring Play will not
wash the horrible color off the body
dramatic. It will be admitting defeat
and paying the dramatic debt out of
the student-body funds. That is irk
some as well as costly.
