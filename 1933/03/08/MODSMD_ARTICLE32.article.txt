RASPUTIN AND THE EMPRESS |
(M-G-M) — At the Columbia
Theatre.
It's a field day when the three
Barrymores appear together, and no
pains have been spared to make
this a memorable film, and that it is.
The difficult problem of combining
these three talents has been met ad
mirably by the director, Richard >
Boleslavsky.
Dominated by the hypocritical,
hypnotizing Rasputin (Lionel), the
picture tells the tragic fate of the
last of the Romanoffs in a highly
theatrical manner. It is long, and
there are portions in the center
which could well be cut in favor of
the unity of the story. Too much
footage is devoted to the monstrosi- 1
ties of the mad monk, whose char
acter can be established in half the
time.
Giver* this extended footage, a
grotesque make-up, and a natural
tendency to overact, Lionel's inter- I
pretation is greatly overdrawn—and
overdi'awing an already overdrawn
character like Rasputin is no mean
overdrawing.
My inclination is to divide honors
between Ethel, impressive in her
screen debut, and John, of whom we
have grown to expect much. Ethel, 1
because she is wholly convincing as j
the tired and majestic empress, be- '
cause her voice is splendid, and be
cause she more than justifies her
place as queen of the royal family. i
John, because he is convincing, and j
because his work is colored—one |
wishes more so—by that excellent
comedy of which he has lately
shown himself a master.
An amazing trio, these Barry- 1
mores; one never has the sensation
of "three Barrymores acting all over
the place" to overshadow each
other, and often loses them in the
characters they play. i

| Special mention must be made the
last episode of the picture, which is
one of the most memorable I have
ever seen. In a brief, almost crush
ing, scene is depicted the final fate
of the Romanoffs; it is unforgettable.
In the face of this overwhelming
opposition, Ralph Morgan makes an
excellent impression as the Tsar. His
f is the most subdued work, and he
makes Nicholas II an earnest and
: weary monarch caught in the stream
of circumstances.
Diana Wynard is pleasing in the
negative role of the fragile heroine,
while Tad Alexander exhibits much
charm and almost too much assur
ance as the young Tsarevitch.
BARNEY BURKE (William H. Salt)
At the Palo Alto Community
Theatre.
Barney Burke is an episodic play
in four scenes, each scene lasting
, less than half an hour. Added to the
' difficulty of sketching a man's life
in so short a time was the task of
making the liquor question fresh and
yet serious material for modern
drama.
The ghosts of "Ten Nights in a
' Barroom" still stalk, despite the
ironic twist given to the play by
making Burke's teetotalism the
! cause for all his misfortune. Falling
' apart in the usual episodic fashion,
the four scenes, loosely held together
by the lone figure of Barney Burke,
: worked to their own separate cli
! ir.axes, for which the playwright
| unfortunately used stagey and
cliche situations, to wit: The ejec
tion of a drunken scoundrel from
an honest man's home, the entrance
of a helpless mother as her husband
i goes off to whip the erring son, the
craving and final surrender of Bar
ney to the Demon Rum.
Although all the actors played
1 with the utmost sincerity, a greater

use of restraint would have gained
a better effect. Dick Fisher's changes
in mood were so sudden and start
ling as actually to scare the audi
t-nee. To be commended: Janice
Paulman and George Mozart in their
small comedy roles of maid and
Eyetalian bootlegger, the effective
third-act setting, Peg Converse in
her one-line role of secretary, Wil
liam Salt's courage in attempting
such a difficult theme, Waldo Salt
on the unobtrusiveness of his direc
tion (except in two very bad places),
the excellence of the posters adver
tising the play. —Brauns
