"CHICAGO—An assault with a
steam shovel was the basis of a
cruelty charge made today by Mrs.
Rose McGowan in a bill for divorce
filed against Joseph McGowan. Mrs.
McGowan went to an excavation
where her husband was operating
his shovel, to take him his lunch.
"He became provoked at her re
quest for his pay check and after a
few words swung the boom of Ins
steam shovel about and scooped her
up. He started to jounce her around
in the shovel bucket, but she leaped
out when she was a few feet from
the ground."—S.F. Chronicle.
