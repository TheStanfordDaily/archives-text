# Ex Committee Bans Burlesque In Favor Of Legitimate Play

Militant maidens in defense of
their art!
That was what greeted last
night's Ex Committee meeting and
its move to abolish the spring
quarter drama production in favor
of the hirsute pulchritude of a
men's burlesque.
Present in addition to the Ex
Committee were dramatics director
Harold Helvenston, members of the
Dramatic Council, and many women
prominent in past campus plays.
Initiated by Manager Charles Karl,
the move was based on financial
reasons and the feeling that the
spfing quarter calendar is too full
to insure adequate support of two
plays.
Early in the fracas it was agreed
that only one production—nature
undetermined—should be proferred
this spring.
Merits Considered
Then ensued a consideration of the
respective merits of a burlesque—
originally proposed by the Theatre
Fund Committee to replace the late
lamented Junior Opera—and a
straight, lively dramatic piece of the
nature of "Holiday."
The result was an almost unani
mous triumph of art (with the
budget balance close in tow), and
the decision that a legitimate play
will be the piece de resistance of
next quarter.
Considerations were off-campus
support, undeniably large, a possi
bility of augmented publicity and
more effective seat-selling tactics,
and the very minor point of the
painful lack of genius among local
scribes who would submit burlesque
manuscripts.
Meeting Slated
Before the end of the week an
other meeting will be held to vote
on the Dramatic Council's proposed
selection. A definite play is now
under consideration, one to which
Helvenston has just been able to
secure rights. It is a gay comedy of
the nature of "Holiday," and one
which should not only prove a
worthy successor to the successful
Barry play, but with co-operation,
get di'amatics out of the red.
