# ELLINGTON EXPECTS SACRAMENTO J.C. TO WHIP BABE TRACK SQUAD
## 
### JOHN KLINE 
Notwithstanding the fact that the (
yearling tracksters are the best j
Stanford has produced in many a '
year, Coach Bill Ellington expects !
his charges to take a licking at the
hands of the strong Sacramento J.C.
squad, when they tangle Saturday.
The capitol city boys have shown
themselves to have an unusually .
potent jaysee outfit.
With improvement being shown j
on all sides, the Papooses are look
ing forward with anticipation to
ward the Little Big Meet, which
it now appears they should be able
to annex quite easily.
Kingsbury, who turned in pheno
menal times in the hurdles Saturday,
is a second and a half better than
Gainor, best California man. Klop
stock, his teammate, has been a
scant yard or two to the rear of ,

Knigsbury in each of their races to
date. This capable pair has reminded
Farm fans of the famous Packard-
Meier duo of the frosh track two
years ago.
Nimnio, Papoose star miler, has
shown himself to be the almost
pathetic total of twenty-one seconds
faster than would-be Cub miler
Fowler.
Recently two new freshmen
have started to make their bids as
first-place winners: Gib Halloway
in the discus, Dellinger in the 440.
Ilolloway is the first frosh weight
man to heave the platter over 130
feet.
Dellinger is fast leaving the me
diocre class. His unexpected and fast
finish to capture second against the
Alameda All-Stars, proved that
Davis is not the only quarter-miler.
