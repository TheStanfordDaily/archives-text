## A 						Saga of Love— With A Moral 
### 
In the faint, shielded light and the ,
harsh radio voice of an off-campus
cottage, a college editor and a col
lege athlete sat and tafked. The edi
tor was smoking because he was a I
college editor; the athlete was '
Swearing because he was a college
athlete. Both were drinking because
they were collegiate.
Two college widows were in the
kitchen, trying to fry eggs on both
sides and simultaneously to retain
their pristine softness.
"Frank," said the athlete, "your
paper ish loushy. It i.sh rotten and
terrible. In a word, Frank, it ish no
good."
"My dear Elliott," answered the
editor, "if you will kindly hesitate
in your blasphemous outpourings of
idiotic, not to mention fallacious,
monosyllables for a space of time of
sufficient duration to permit me to
correctly inform you of the ideals,
principles, and also (I hasten to add
in parenthesis) the disastrous finan
cial handicaps of the paper, perhaps
the native intelligence that seems
temporarily to have deserted your
occasionally partially filled cranium
will return."
"I shay the paper ish lousy," in
sisted the athlete.
"And I shay so because it don't
support the football team."
"Again," exasperated the editor,
"your loud-mouthings appear ludi
crops, inane, and in several other |
manifestations mistaken. It has been '
our habit (handed down to us from
bygone generations of college edi
tors) to print a front page story on
the football team every day during
that period of intercollegiate brawl
ing and mauling commonly named
in the vulgar vernacular 'the foot
ball season.'"
And the editor leaned hack wtih
the benign expression of a suc
cessful missionary, hastily with
drawing a tentative hand from the
knee of one of the college widows.
"Horsh feather of a decided
blueness," snorted the athlete. "Your
damned sheet panned ush guys all
season."
"And can you," gurgled the editor
dreamily, "in the impertinent im

maturity of your unsophisticated
adolescence, demonstrate why we
of the press should show any more
proper deference for you brave
young gladiators of the gridiron who
weekly sortie forth to meet their
doom at the hands of ihc rough
Moragans and others of their un
couth ilk than you show for us of
the press?"
"Nuts," sighed the athlete, with
downcast eyes.
"Make it 'nerts,'" corrected the
editor. "There are ladies (perhaps
I should add 'of a kind') present."
"It's shure duty to shupport the
! football team, by God, Frank," said
the athlete, "and I ish going to pour
us each another drink from this hair
tonic bottle. Let ush hope that them
damn wenches stays in the kitchen,
where women rightly belongs when
there ain't much left and the barber
shops ish closed and we ish broke."
"Elliott," said the editor, "you
have leveled against the industri
ous minions of the omnipotent
press the foul and filthy indict
ment of 'panning the football
team.' Perhaps you can inform
this inquisitive and ignorant in
dividual, Elliott, just why the
magnificent publication that you'
so basely pan and condemn as a
'damned sheet' should not pan
your damned football team.
"Can thhe idea not penetrate the
thick hairy covering of your .skull,"
continued the editor, "that the foot
ball team and the paper are both
among our beloved alma mater's be
loved institutions and that if you pan
my much-amoured institution, then
I can in all fairness pan your pas- I
sionate love?"
But the athlete said only "nuts."
Just then the college widows
came in with egg and hair tonic
all over themselves, and the col
lege editor and the collegc athlete
sat and swore and drank in the
faint, shiledcd light and harsh ra
dio voice. —Dick Strouse
