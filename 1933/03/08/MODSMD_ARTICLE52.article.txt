# Anderson Stars On P. A. Shelter Woodpile Squad
## 
### 
Stan Anderson, who hit Coast
Conference lines for yards and
yards last football season, hit
the Palo Alto Community Shel
ter woodpile for nineteen board
feet of sawdust and a basketful
of chips Monday.
Ticketed in the recent crime
drive, Anderson approached the
police judge and exhibited the
famous Anderson grin, with the
following results:
"Two dollars and fifty cents,"
decreed the bench.
'"Brother, if I had two and a
half I'd split it with you," Andy
told him.
'Til give you a chance to
split," the Judge replied in ef
fect. "You begin where Abe
Lincoln left off."
And they took the crestfallen
footballer to the woodpile.
