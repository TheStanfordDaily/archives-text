# Phonograph Aided Lomax In 'Canning' Range Songs
## 
### 
Arriving last evening from Texas,
six feet tall, with a hearty laugh and
leisurely manner, John A. Lomax,
cowboy songster, began to talk of
the days when in search of songs he
scoured the plains with a phono
graph and recording apparatus.
"The cowboys used to congregate
in the saloons," Lomax said. "But
they were distrustful of an outsider
who tried to copy down their anony
mous songs. I would go in and drink
with them and after a certain point
they'd begin to sing. Then I would
bring out my machine and 'can' the
melodies."
Cowboy's Lament Liked
"The Cowboy's Lament," begin
ning—"Oli, bury me out on the
prairie," is the most popular of
the tunes. "St. James Infirmary,"
another favorite, was originally an

old English ballad, "cleaned up,"
Lomax said, "by American cow
punchers."
The Texan had many narrow es
capes in his adventures after songs.
While camping out in a tent one
night, Lomax just missed being
gored by a mad bull.
Brought up on the Texas range,
Lomax was later graduated from
Harvard. He thinks Will Rogers is a
great artist, "although he looks like
a cowboy." Zane Grey, he considers
a dude "no 'count" author.
As he left for dinner before his
program in the Assembly Ilall,
Lomax said:
"I'm a Democrat, but I voted
for Hoover. It's a long story . .
