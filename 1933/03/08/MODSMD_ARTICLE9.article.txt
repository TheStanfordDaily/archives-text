# Huskies Debate Here Tomorrow
## 
### 
The question of cancellation of the
war debts will be semi-officially
settled tomorrow night when Stan
ford debates the University of
Washington in the last campus debt
discussion of the winter quarter.
William Kaye and Dave McDaniel,
Stanford seniors, will meet Robert
Burns and Lyle Spencer, Jr., of
Washington. Both Stanford men
have had three years' debating ex
perience.
The debate will be conducted in
the cross-examination style. Each
man, after he has delivered his
constructive argument, must stand
up under a five-minute barrage of
cross-question by the opposing
team.
William Kaye, Phi Beta Kappa, is
a member of Delta Sigma, national
honorary forensic fraternity, and has
been awarded the Stanford debate
key.
A major in political science, Dave
McDaniel is a Delta Sigma Rho
member-nominate. He also dangles
a debate key from his vest.
