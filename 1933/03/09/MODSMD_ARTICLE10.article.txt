## 
### 
Announcement that the Ex Com
mittee had abandoned plans for a
spring quarter Burlesque, or men's
Hi-Jinks, in favor of a straight dra
matic production, probably of a light
comedy nature, was greeted by fa
vorable comment yesterday by fol
lowers of campus dramatics.
Statements of Stanford students,
who were interviewed upon the
change, are as follows:
Stan Beaubaire, chairman of the
Theatre Fund Committee: "Person
ally, I apologize to those who
have already written scripts for the
anticipated Men's Burlesque. What
ever manuscripts have been com
pleted, however, are not wasted, as
they should be retained and submit
ted for the Gaieties next fall.
"Although the abolition of the
proposed men's show is somewhat of
a blow to the plans of the Theatre
Fund Committee, we feel that it is
to the best interests of Stanford dra
matics that, if one had to go, it had
better be the Burlesque rather than
the legitimate production of the
quarter."
Barbara Collins: '"There is no ques
tion but that the only production
should be a legitimate play with a
mixed cast.
Joe Wolf: "Since there will be only
one show, it will be a better finan
cial success if we drop the Burlesque
idea.
Emily Ross: "I think the legitimate
play idea is better. It gives both men
and women a chance and is probably
a greater drawing card."
