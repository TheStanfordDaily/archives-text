# Dr. Wilbur Back At Desk; Lauds Work Of Swain
## 
### BOB LETTS 
Back at his desk in the Adminis- !
tration Building inside of four days j
from the time that his duties as,
Secretary of the Interior were ter- j
minated by the inauguration, Dr. j
Ray Lyman Wilbur yesterday began j
.slipping into the University Presi- !
dent's harness and attempting to j
solve several current problems — i
principally enrollment—which have j
worried executive heads on the
campus during the last year.
Although another drop in regis- j
(ration is expected next month, the
tall, lean medic appeared unruf
fled by the prospects and passed it
off with the remark that every ;
spring quarter sees a falling off in
the number of students.
The question of finances is next in I
importance. Dr. Wilbur intimated
that University authorities are not !
so much concerned with endowment j
increases, as with the problem of \
preventing them from dropping off.
Efficient handling of the presiden
tial duties by Dr. Robert Eckles
Swain during Dr. Wilbur's absence I
drew high praise.
"You couldn't ask for a more con- (
scientious and co-operative man than j
Dr. Swain," the president said. "He I
deserves the vacation which he is i
soon going to take."
Dr. Swain, after nearly four years "j
of uninterrupted work as adminis- |
trative head here, will soon leave |
for the East and possibly Europe for j
an indefinite stay. While primarily
vacatipning, he will devote a good
share of his time to research work I
in chemistry, of which he is the !
dean at Stanford.
Then came the Depression. Dr. !
Wilbur had lots to say about it. j
"People are just beginning to real- '
ize that you can't spend 300 mil- '
lions of dollars and take 20 mil
lions of lives without paying for it
afterwards," he pointed out. "We !
were stronger than most nations j
and held off for awhile, but now :
we arc feeling the effccts."
Asked if he thought the depres
sion had reached the bottom, he re- i
ferrcd to a friend back East who had
said, "I thought I had hit the bot- j
torn, but I found out that the bottom j
slopes."
Dr. Wilbur charged American !
people, as a whole, with lacking :
confidence. Not speaking from a par- ;
tisan viewpoint, he indicated that j
"things might be different now" if !
people had taken a co-opei'ative at- j
titude at the start.

Except for appearing a little tired
from his quick trip across the con
tinent with his wife, Dr. Wilbur was
in good spirits. He arrived at Oak
land at 8:30 o'clock yesterday morn
ing, wa smet by Ray Lyman Wilbur,
Jr., '33, and brought to the campus,
and by 10:30 o'clock he was seated
at his old desk going through notes
and papers and conferring with Dr.
Swain.

lions of lives without paying for it
afterwards," he pointed out. "We !
were stronger than most nations j
and held off for awhile, but now :
we arc feeling the effccts."
Asked if he thought the depres
sion had reached the bottom, he re- i
ferrcd to a friend back East who had
said, "I thought I had hit the bot- j
torn, but I found out that the bottom j
slopes."
Dr. Wilbur charged American !
people, as a whole, with lacking :
confidence. Not speaking from a par- ;
tisan viewpoint, he indicated that j
"things might be different now" if !
people had taken a co-opei'ative at- j
titude at the start.

Except for appearing a little tired
from his quick trip across the con
tinent with his wife, Dr. Wilbur was
in good spirits. He arrived at Oak
land at 8:30 o'clock yesterday morn
ing, wa smet by Ray Lyman Wilbur,
Jr., '33, and brought to the campus,
and by 10:30 o'clock he was seated
at his old desk going through notes
and papers and conferring with Dr.
Swain.
Back at his desk in the Adminis- !
tration Building inside of four days j
from the time that his duties as,
Secretary of the Interior were ter- j
minated by the inauguration, Dr. j
Ray Lyman Wilbur yesterday began j
.slipping into the University Presi- !
dent's harness and attempting to j
solve several current problems — i
principally enrollment—which have j
worried executive heads on the
campus during the last year.
Although another drop in regis- j
(ration is expected next month, the
tall, lean medic appeared unruf
fled by the prospects and passed it
off with the remark that every ;
spring quarter sees a falling off in
the number of students.
The question of finances is next in I
importance. Dr. Wilbur intimated
that University authorities are not !
so much concerned with endowment j
increases, as with the problem of \
preventing them from dropping off.
Efficient handling of the presiden
tial duties by Dr. Robert Eckles
Swain during Dr. Wilbur's absence I
drew high praise.
"You couldn't ask for a more con- (
scientious and co-operative man than j
Dr. Swain," the president said. "He I
deserves the vacation which he is i
soon going to take."
Dr. Swain, after nearly four years "j
of uninterrupted work as adminis- |
trative head here, will soon leave |
for the East and possibly Europe for j
an indefinite stay. While primarily
vacatipning, he will devote a good
share of his time to research work I
in chemistry, of which he is the !
dean at Stanford.
Then came the Depression. Dr. !
Wilbur had lots to say about it. j
"People are just beginning to real- '
ize that you can't spend 300 mil- '
lions of dollars and take 20 mil
lions of lives without paying for it
afterwards," he pointed out. "We !
were stronger than most nations j
and held off for awhile, but now :
we arc feeling the effccts."
