# Mrs. Moody Mixes Tennis, Art, Marriage Happily
## 
### ELIZABETH PAINE 
Deft, coo], decisive, Helen Moody
.Scit waiting, vlsored, racquet on lap,
for her match.
"Art is what I like best of all,"
she said, as she had, ten years ago
when the world began to take note
of her tennis.
'"Recently in the Orient I learned
greatly to admire Japanese art, the
elder things. So much of what we
get here is not their best." Mrs.
Moody is also fond of Japanese food.
"Are you all setâ€”" Mrs. Moody
calmly got up and walked out on
the court, becoming Helen Wills
j.gain in her short, pleated skirt and
bare legs.
"f feel ever so much better now,"
she? remarked, slightly ' breathless
after three sharp sets. "You know,
I've had nothing to eat all day." Sho
appeared fresh, her hair, unruffled,
shining copper.
Caught in after-the-game traffic,

Mrs. Moody skipped lightly aside,
calling back to her husband, "Look
out, dear."
Asked if he played tennis, Mr.
Moody said:
"I play squash."
"Really, he's been taking an inter
est in tennis lately," said his wife.
"He is doing quite nicely."
As Mrs. Moody had hoped before
her marriage, she finds she can com
bine career and home, slighting
neither. Present-day domestic duties
need consume but little time, she
thinks.
"Interviews must bore you after
having had so many?" Mrs. Moody
was asked.
"Not at all," she answered. "I en
joy interviewing the interviewer.
Next to my painting, journalism ab
sorbs my attention most. At present
I am working on two or three maga
zine stories, letting my art rest."
