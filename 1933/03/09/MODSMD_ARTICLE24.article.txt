# Local Bankers Doubt Wisdom Of Guarantees
## Unified Banking System Is Needed For Success 
### DAVE MELLINKOFF 
While Democracy's big shots dis
cussed yesterday the possibility of
i instituting a system of federal guar
| antee of bank deposits, local bankers
: appeared dubious, doubtful, even
i gloomy as to the desirability of the
! plan.
D. W. Buchan, manager of the
Palo Alto branch of the American
| Trust Company, stated: "If the ad- J
I ministration in Washington is able !
1 to change the economic trend for the 1
j better—then the deposit guarantee
I would not be necessary. If the down
(ward trend continues, the scheme
, would prove quite costly to the tax- I
I payer."
Said Palo Alto National Bank's
j Charles J. Crary: "An ordinance in-
I stituting the guarantee law would
i have to be carefully drawn unless
i the careful, experienced banker with
I ample capital were to be penalized
for bankers who are careless, in
experienced, and lacking in solid
capital backing."
Buchan quoted history to show
J that bank deposit guarantees have
! been unsuccessful since pre-Civil
j War days when the system was tried
! ;n New York. "The number of states
| which have experimented with the 1
j plan since the World War have been
| 100 per cent unsuccessful in their
i attempts," he said.
If the government does inaugurate
I the deposit guarantee, Crary stated
! that a more-unified banking system
, all over the nation would aid the
plan's success. Both bankers insist
that close supervision would be es
j sential.
Conclusion: Quoth Crary, "It
makes no difference whether we like
It or not—l should not be surprised
j if it comes."
