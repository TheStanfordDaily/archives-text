•Ins! another vending machine painted a subdued
green and complete willi mirror hut it points a two-way
moral. Two of them, distributing a nationally-known
weekly founded, if is said, by one Benj. Franklin, have
recently appeared on the campus one at the Hook-store
and flic other ;it the Cellar. Drop in a nickel and vou have
your magazine, presumably untouched by human hands.
(idling back to the two-way moral, one of fhem is
obvious. Another source of income has been gulped by the
machine. Not content with depriving the working-man of
much of his labor, the machine has turned even to the
newsboys' pennies. The usurpation begins to be complete.
Again, il seems that (he promoters of the machines have
accurately gauged tlie reading tastes of what has been
called the campus intelligentsia. No machines vending the
"quality" group of magazines are likely to appear on the
campus. Times are hard everywhere.
One nickel, folks and you can look in the mirror as
you slip il in.
