# The 						"Chronicle" Prefers A Winnerâ€”To California's Chagrin
## 
### 
I lie editors of the Daily Calif ornian have come to the
horrible conclusion that the Sporting Green of the San
Francisco Chronicle is failing to give California sports the
space they deserve. As a consequence at least three depart
ments of the college paper rise in righteous indignation.
"What San Francisco morning paper," asks a columnist,
"featuring a green sports sheet, ran exactly 2 IS inches of
Stanford sport publicity during the last three days to 17
inches of I'.C. sports publicity?" He neglected to ask which
of the two universities has one of the best track teams in
the country and which won its eighteenth consecutive
swimming meet from the other this week-end. lie seems
to forget that winners, not losers, make Ihe best news.
The C.alifornian editor openly resents the presence of
Dink Templeton as a Chronicle. sports writer. He very
niccl\ admits that Dink is a good track coach but denies
his ability to report coast athletics. Templeton was hired
by the Chronicle to cover Stanford sports, and seems to be
doing a good job of it. It seems a pity that California
sports are not of flu* calibre to warrant a special writer.
The I'.C. paper further intimates that the Chronicle is
liable lo he faced with a campus "moratorium on sub
scriptions." California men will, no doubt, turn to the
( .all-Bulletin where they are well represented bv their bald
headed, perennial freshman, Brick Morse.
