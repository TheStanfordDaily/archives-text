# Another Contribution To the Fraternity Question
## 
### 
The Times, through a Mr. 11. I. Brock, ha-s puffed lip its
pudgy cheeks and despatched a sudden, if a !>i 1 wheezy, |
gasp in our direction. The Times' Mr. Brock, after a survey
of a "representative number of colleges. North, South and
West, urban and rural," has decided that we have been
wrong all along about fraternities. For, says Mr. Brock,
"competent authority, the best-informed opinion" is unani
mous that "fraternities should not be abolished Co
lumbia, where the question had been so sharply raised,
heartily concurring."
Mr. Brock has an evident horror of change, a horror
which he extends so as to include any possible substitutes
for fraternities. lie even offers his horror as a reason why
.fraternities should continue to exist, stating that they
"should not Ik 1 abolished if for no other reason than that
they could not be abolished at present without substitute
groupings of undergraduates promptly taking their places."
Moreover, Mr. Brock, although admitting that fraterni
ties are subject to many faults, believes that their tradi
tional form contains something peculiarly invaluable. This
spiritual contribution, so far as we were able to make out,
consists of "the powerful incentive which consciousness of
historic continuity gives toward a line of conduct decently
respectful of public opinion and regardful of acceptable
standards." Any substitute, he feels, "more accidental and
less responsible, would be less in tune with the college
spirit."
(ietling down to the actual problem, we find Mr. Brock
in delightfully expansive mood. He condones political con
trol by fraternity groups as "a vital part of American col
lege life." Control by a fraternity "ring" is not important
anyway, Mr. Brock argues, since "interest in college offices
has tended to grow less acute and interest in sport and
even in academic pursuits [the emphasis is our own] to
increase." Kxclusiveness is likewise harmless, he says, as
it "is mutual and hurts nobody."
