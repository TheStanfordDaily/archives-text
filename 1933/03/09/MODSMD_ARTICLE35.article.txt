### ABE MELLINKOFF 
A recent movie supplies our ex
j ample. A well-known forger, who
has become too well-known, is
I handed a "good" check for a mil-
I lion dollars by an eccentric multi
millionaire. He of course thinks his
: financial worries are over—until he
tries to cash the check. His under
i world buddies of course laugh at
him—knowing his proficiency at
I signing checks. Walking into a bank
ii like walking to the penitentiary.
After wandering cold and hungry
for days, he goes raving mad with a
I million dollars in his pocket—on
' which he cannot realize ten cents
in cash for a Hop-house bed. Now,
parallels are dangerous things to
draw—because half the readers are
i sure you are running around in a
j circle, and the other one thinks you
! are off on a tangent.
I ra
However, the present economic
situation is a parallel of the straight
! est order. No, I haven't a check for
! a million dollars but the nation as
a nation has many millions upon
which it can realize nothing. We
had our unrealizable millions even
before the banks closed. It only took
that, dramatic irritation to smear the
j fact before our myopic vision.
The situation is enough to drive a
sensitive person insane. And before
this business is all over, psychology
will probably be talking of Demen
tia Depressiona. We have too much
wheat, so there is a shortage of
bread. We pour milk in the streets
to raise the price—while children

develop rickets 100 yards away.
There is an excess of everything and
not enough of anything.
There is over-production and
under-consumption — a madhouse
situation of the worst order. During
a famine, it's at least logical to starve
even if it is inconvenient. But dur
ing a bumper year to go hungry is
illogical and inconvenient. At least,
we should bo logical. As they say
up in Eastern Oregon, the thing is
"outa kilter."
The nearest I have ever come to
going "red"—was a bad sunburn
last year at the beach. I never have
been able to see any of the popular
"isms"—and still can't. But if un
employment increases at the same
rate in the next four years as it has
since 1928, we will all be unem
ployed and will all of course be so
cialists—whether we happen to vote
Democratic or Republican.
The hen who starved to death
while sitting on a bushel basket of
corn is no simpler than 120 millions
making and growing too much—at
the same time eating and using too
little. The forger in the parallel
knew he had a million dollars but
he couldn't get a cent. The nation
knows that it has many millions—
but it is all about as much good as
the uncashable check.
The foj-ger was afraid to go to a
bank. We are just as paralyzed. The
penitentiary awaited him. New ideas
await us.
