THE MIKADO (Gilbert and Sulli
van) —At the Marionette Guild
j (reopening March 10 at 1749 Clay
Street).
Closing the season at his theatre
I on Montgomery Street in San Fran-
I cisco, Ralph Chesse presented "The
j Mikado" to an enthusiastic audience.
| The production was elaborate and
| successful. The spirit of the piece
j was admirably maintained.
At first, glance, it would seem to
1 •
! be quite impossible to do justice to
j Gilbert and Sullivan with marion-
J ettes. However, after seeing Mr.
| Chesse's performance of "The Mi
j kado," we should eagerly anticipate
| another production of similar nature.
| The music, recorded, was kept
from becoming possibly boring by
j the deft gestures and dances of the
marionettes. The dialogue was read,
1 on the whole, with a proper sense
! of comedy and satire, with the major

1 exception of Charles Bratt's Poo-
Bah, one of the most enjoyable of
, Gilbert's characters.
His voice not only lacked the color
necessary, but also the pomposity
necessary to the part. Outstanding
on the other hand, was Ralph
Chesse's "Ko-Ko. the Lord High
Executioner."
This part was original and thor
oughly humorous. Mr. Chesse, in
combination with the marionette, !
made Ko-Ko by far the most enjoy
able character of the evening. Yum-
Yum. played by Marcelle Chesse,
and Nanki-Poo, played by Crawford
Berks, deserve honorable mention
as the romantic couple.
Yum-Yum's scene at the opening
of the second act was one of the
best of the play. The settings were
extremely attractive and lent to the
airy spirit of the piece. The marion
i ettes were a trifle too similar in their ,

dress and physiognomy to be easily
distinguished by the audience.
The evening as a whole main
tained the high standard of Mr.
Chesse's work, and we look forward
with a great deal of anticipation to
(he opening on Friday of his new
theatre at 1749 Clay Street, San
Francisco. —Salt
