# ELLINGTON CHEERY AS BABE TRACK SQUAD PREPARES FOR PANTHERS
## 
### 
Though his galloping freshmen
face their stifTest competition of the
season to date with Sacramento Jun
ior College here Saturday, Coach
Bill Ellington worries not a whit.
Chuck Nimmo, frosh miler, who
has made quite a record for him
self, will face some strong competi
tion from the Jaysees, who have two
4:30 men.
Hunt Kingsbury and his running
mate, Klopstock, will be pressed to
the limit in the highs as they will
face a 15-second man. In the lows
Sacramento has a timber topper ca
pable of 24 seconds which may bring
the frosh their first hurdle defeat of
ihe season.
Sacramento, with an even-time
man in the sprints, should give
Grayson and Klopstock some stiff
competition.
Chuck Jonas in the pole vault and
Reynolds in the shot, both rate high.

The latter may experience some
trouble with a Sacramento behemoth
throwing the shot 44 feet. The discus
looked like a certain defeat for
Stanford until a couple of days ago
when Gib Halloway threw the plat
ter past the 130-foot mark.
Beckett, who is fast improving,
should place in the half Saturday.
Although up against 52-second com
petition in the 440, either Davis or
Del linger has a chance to win.
With Albertson, 6-foot-one high
jumper, still ineligible, Nobs appears
to be the best bet to place.
