# "BLAZING BEN" SET TO TOP OWN MARK IN OLYMPIC MEET
## 
### 
Ben Eastman will renew his
campaign against the 440 record
Saturday! The blond speedster
turned in a .'!(!.!) mark in the 352
yesterday and retired for the rest
of the week, while Coach Dink
Templeton announced he will turn
him loose for a record attempt
against the Olympic Club.
While Eastman was doing his stuff,
the veteran Les Hables kicked up
his heels and did 9.8 in the century,
the first time he has broken 10 flat
this season. Les does not compete
against the Olympians, but he will
be eligible next quarter.
Since its clash with S.F.U. the
Olympic Club has been considerably
padded with new material, so that
it should give the Indians plenty of
competition.
For instance, Norman Bright in
the half is plenty sweet, finishing
but a step behind the sensational
freshman. Niinmo, when the lat
ter ran his 3:11.6 three-lap race.
Then, the Club has strength in the
pole vault with George Pool, Jack
Wood, and A1 Johns in the event,
also boasting Montague, Sparks, and
Loveridge in the sprints, and Fried
man and Churchill in the javelin.
