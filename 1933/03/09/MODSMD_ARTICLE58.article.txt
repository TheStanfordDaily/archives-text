# Feeley, Glover In Final Bouts Tuesday Night
## 
### 
When featherweight Jim Feely
enters the Pavilion ring Tuesday
night to box Captain John Jan of
California, he will bring to a close
one of the briefest and most suc
cessful careers in Stanford ring his
tory. Feely has not been beaten
since coming to the Farm.
Another fine Indian boxer. Cap
tain Fred Glover, will also step
through the ropes for the last
time. He lights Angclo Ma/.etta of
California.
Feely entered Stanford with the
reputation of being one of the finest
amateur featherweights in boxing,
and he has lived up to his name.
Feely's first intercollegiate bout after
winning the University champion
ship was with Ronald Painter, Pa
cific Coast featherweight champion,
boxing for the California Aggies.
The Stanford featherweight's next
victim was Captain Jan of Califor
nia, his rematch opponent next
Tuesday. Jan put up an excellent
battle but was beaten by a sub
stantial margin.
When Feely squared off with De
La Cruz of the Aggies last Friday,
the Davis Filipino stayed as far
away as he could from the Stanford
boxer until the third round when
Feely gave the Aggie boxer a fine
thrashing.
Feely's greatest assets are a fine
straight left, a dynamic right to
use in close, excellent counter
punching ability, and the very
concrete asset of being able to
"take it." His finale against Jan
Tuesday night, though fairly cer
tain to end in a Stanford victory,
should provide some great battling.
