# Campus Stirred By Dramatic Decision
## Ram's Head Group Protests Action Of Stanford Executive Body 
### 
| Ram's Head Honorary Society last
night expressed dissatisfaction at the
action of the Executive Committee
in abolishing the Men's Hi-Jinks
which was to be substituted for the
traditional Junior Opera. Jack Red-
J head, president of the society, issued
I the following statement:
i Editor, Stanford Daily
' Dear Sir:
Not merely as members of a
j Stanford dramatic society, but also
I as representatives of a considerable
opinion of the entire student body,
we wish to express our regret over
the lamentable action taken last
night, by the Executive Committee.
A Men's Hi-Jinks was substituted
for the Junior Opera in response to
campus opinion expressed in favor
| of a student-written show.
We see no reason why a Men's
Hi-Jinks would not be a financial
success. Certainly it would be a
drawing card (even those charming
ladies who are objecting would want
| to see it). It should cost no more
' to produce since no royalties would
j have to be paid and costumes for
j such a show should be no more ex
! pensive than for any other.
It is questionable whether even a
small minority on this campus is in
j favor of the elimination of student
| written shows, but such seems to be
I coming. The answer lies in the Men's
| Hi-Jinks!
Yours for a successful student
j showâ€”Ram's Head Society.
