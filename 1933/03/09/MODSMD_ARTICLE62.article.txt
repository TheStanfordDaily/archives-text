# WOMAN ACE LOSES SET TO CARD STAR IN EXHIBITION PLAY
## 
### 
Debonair Helen Wills Moody
again gave conclusive proof that .she
still retains her supremacy in the
women's field, when she appeared in
an interesting singles and mixed
doubles match yesterday afternoon.
Over 700 campus tennis fans
crowded into bleachers and tempor
ary seats to watch the matches. Mrs.
Moody made a prompt appearance at
2 o'clock on the courts against Joe
Coughlin.
The one-set exhibition was a see
saw affair, going to deuce at 7-7 all
until Coughlin finally broke through
to win, 9-7. Mrs. Moody, although
her strokes were even more effec
tive than usual, did not extend her
self particularly, standing deep in
middle court, and shooting backhand
drives and sizzling forehands to
Coughlin.
However, Coughlin made tip the
advantage by his hard service and
put-away shots at the net. He caught
Mrs. Moody out of position and
capitalized with accurate placements.
In the mixed doubles, Phil Neer,
former Stanford player, and an old
partner of Mrs. Moody, teamed up
with her against Gerry Stratford and
Alice Marble.
