### 
WASHINGTON. March 8 (/Pi-
Nervous speakeasy patrons, unable
to shake off an apprehensive
thought of possible raids hy Fed
eral agents received the reassur
ing word from Prohibition Direc
tor Woodcock today that hence
forth his men will pay little at
tention to such violations.
Under a change of policy made
known by Woodcock, the Federal
Government will concentrate "al
most entirely" on liquor manufac
turers and transporters and will
leave the speakeasy problem to the
States.
Wire Tappnlg Barred
The new plan puts in immediate
effect restrictions imposed by Con
gress against spending any money
after July 1 for wire tapping or for
purchasing liquor as evidence.
The regulations went out on
March 3, the day before President
Roosevelt was inaugurated.
Woodcock said the restriction
against buying evidence "will make
it virtually impossible for the bu
reau to be effective against speak
earies in most jurisdictions" and that
"in the main" such complaints will
be referred to local authorities.
"It is probably a good thing in the
long run," he added, "because it
will tend to focus attention upon the
responsibility of local authorities
upon speakeasies and similar viola
tions, and make our work more ef
fective by fixing a more definite ob
jective.
"The new plan will also enable
us to reduce the force after July 1
to conform to the smaller appro
priation without so much loss to
enforcement. I believe this bureau
can be made to operate more ef
ficiently under the new plan."
