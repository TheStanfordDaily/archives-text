Time and again, Bell System engineers have
demonstrated their pioneering bent in working out
unusual telephone construction problems.
For example, they laid a huge conduit under the
Harlem River. They dredged a trench in the river
bottom, lowered enormous sections of iron pipe,
sent down divers to join the sections, encased the
finished tube in concrete. Through this they ran
telephone cables forming one of New York's main
lines of communication. Across the Gila River in
Arizona they constructed a catenary span 237.} feet
long. To bridge oceans, they developed radio tele
phony. They have built telephone lines over moun
tains, across deserts, through swamps.
Their resourcefulness in getting through, over or
under natural barriers makes possible telephone ser
vice that is practically world wide in reach.
