# EASTMAN SEEKS NEW RECORD IN 440 TOMORROW
## Deacon, Miller, Laborde Also To Shoot For World Marks CLUB STRONG IN MILE Will Dedicate Old Oval As Angell Field 
### Albert Guerard 
At shortly before 3 o'clock tomor
row afternoon, Ben Eastman will
make his first 1933 attempt at a
world's record when he lines up for
the 440-yard dash, fourth race of
the Stanford-Olympic Club track
meet to be held in the Old Oval.
The first event begins at 2:10 o'clock.
Notwithstanding the fact that the
Olympians lost their opening meet
of the year to the same S.F.U. team
that was swamped by Stanford,
107-24, the Post Street squad has
been considerably strengthened, and
is confident of its ability to keep
Dink Templeton's men from scoring
more than 95 points.
Eastman's only competition in
liis record-breaking attempt to
morrow will come from two Stan
fend brothers, A1 and Don Black
man. While "Blazin' Ben" is lop
ins down the homestretch in an
effort to cut a small sliver off his
own world mark of 4(5.4 seconds,
the Blackmails will try to go un
der 49 seconds for the first time
in their brief careers as quarter
milers.
Three other Stanford men, pole
vaulters Bill Miller and Bud Dea
con, and discus-thrower Here La
borde, will also be shooting at world
records. Miller and Deacon have
each cleared 14 feet this season; a
vault of 14 feet 2 inches would shat
ter Miller's own universal standard;
a vault of 14 feet, 5 inches would
eclipse Bill Graber's not-yet-ac
cepted record made in the Olympic
tryouts.
Here Laborde's record attempt
will be encouraged by the compe
tition which Bob Jones, former
Stanford star, should provide.
Jones is capable of I(>s feet. La
horde of 170; but tomorrow's con
test will probably not achieve
either of these distances.
Stanford fans will watch with in
terest the sprinting of Jimmy Will
son and Art Rice, the best Indian
dash men, who face severe compe
tition from fast-starting Spencer
Sparks, Ralph Montague, and Fay
Loveridge.
The Olympic Club expects to do
much of its scoring in the 880 and
mile runs where Norman Bright,
an ineligible Stanfordite, and veter
an Harry Carter hold out. Bright is
capable of 1:56 for the half-mile;
Carter in his prime ran a 4:18 mile.
Stanford will rely on long-striding
Sam Eastman, who ran 1:59.2 last
week, and Jim Ferric, who won the
mile against S.F.U. Keegan and
Frazer of the Olympic Club, both
seasoned campaigners in cross
country competition, may upset Art
Azevedo in the two-mile.
Most promising of the Stanford
sophomores, John Mottram, jave
lin-thrower, and Lloyd Schween,
high-jumper, will attempt to repeat
victories scored last week in their
favorite events. Mottram faces a for
mer national titlcholder in Kenny
Churchill; Schween's competition
will come from a teammate, Bob
Keeble.
The practice track, long known
as the Old Oval, will he formally
dedicated as Angell Field Satur
day. in honor of Frank Angell,
emeritus professor of psychology,
one-time trackman.

tryouts.
Here Laborde's record attempt
will be encouraged by the compe
tition which Bob Jones, former
Stanford star, should provide.
Jones is capable of I(>s feet. La
horde of 170; but tomorrow's con
test will probably not achieve
either of these distances.
Stanford fans will watch with in
terest the sprinting of Jimmy Will
son and Art Rice, the best Indian
dash men, who face severe compe
tition from fast-starting Spencer
Sparks, Ralph Montague, and Fay
Loveridge.
The Olympic Club expects to do
much of its scoring in the 880 and
mile runs where Norman Bright,
an ineligible Stanfordite, and veter
an Harry Carter hold out. Bright is
capable of 1:56 for the half-mile;
Carter in his prime ran a 4:18 mile.
Stanford will rely on long-striding
Sam Eastman, who ran 1:59.2 last
week, and Jim Ferric, who won the
mile against S.F.U. Keegan and
Frazer of the Olympic Club, both
seasoned campaigners in cross
country competition, may upset Art
Azevedo in the two-mile.
Most promising of the Stanford
sophomores, John Mottram, jave
lin-thrower, and Lloyd Schween,
high-jumper, will attempt to repeat
victories scored last week in their
favorite events. Mottram faces a for
mer national titlcholder in Kenny
Churchill; Schween's competition
will come from a teammate, Bob
Keeble.
The practice track, long known
as the Old Oval, will he formally
dedicated as Angell Field Satur
day. in honor of Frank Angell,
emeritus professor of psychology,
one-time trackman.
At shortly before 3 o'clock tomor
row afternoon, Ben Eastman will
make his first 1933 attempt at a
world's record when he lines up for
the 440-yard dash, fourth race of
the Stanford-Olympic Club track
meet to be held in the Old Oval.
The first event begins at 2:10 o'clock.
Notwithstanding the fact that the
Olympians lost their opening meet
of the year to the same S.F.U. team
that was swamped by Stanford,
107-24, the Post Street squad has
been considerably strengthened, and
is confident of its ability to keep
Dink Templeton's men from scoring
more than 95 points.
Eastman's only competition in
liis record-breaking attempt to
morrow will come from two Stan
fend brothers, A1 and Don Black
man. While "Blazin' Ben" is lop
ins down the homestretch in an
effort to cut a small sliver off his
own world mark of 4(5.4 seconds,
the Blackmails will try to go un
der 49 seconds for the first time
in their brief careers as quarter
milers.
Three other Stanford men, pole
vaulters Bill Miller and Bud Dea
con, and discus-thrower Here La
borde, will also be shooting at world
records. Miller and Deacon have
each cleared 14 feet this season; a
vault of 14 feet 2 inches would shat
ter Miller's own universal standard;
a vault of 14 feet, 5 inches would
eclipse Bill Graber's not-yet-ac
cepted record made in the Olympic
tryouts.
