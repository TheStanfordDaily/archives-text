# To Reconsider Play Decision
## 
### 
A petition, signed by 50 campus
men; to revive the Men's Bui'lesque,
and the doubtful nature of the bank
situation were two elements which
caused the Ex Committee in a brief
special meeting last night to move
to reconsider last Tuesday's mo
tions to abolish the Men's Burlesque
and retain only the usual spring
quarter play.
The reconsideration will take
place Wednesday at an open meet
ing. At the same time the executive
body will be presented with a finan
cial statement from A1 Masters, and
if the idea of a legitimate play
retained will act on the recommen
dation of the Dramatic Council.
