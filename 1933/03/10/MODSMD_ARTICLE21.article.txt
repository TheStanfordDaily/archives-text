# Inflation Held Huge 'Gamble' For Prosperity
## Credit Expansion—Blessing Or Catastrophe? 
### Sheridan Hegland 
Inflation!
Government presses beginning to
stamp out neatly-engraved bank
notes; bank doors swinging open;
hoarded gold flowing back; the
Federal Reserve System pumping
credit into recalcitrant industry—
Prices rising, slowly at first and
then more rapidly; the value of the
dollar shrinking; postponed orders
quickened to life; bank deposit
owners purchasing before prices
move higher—
Men streaming back to work; j
business men growing optimistic; i
orders cluttering their desks—
The depression lifting; business
booming.
A Hopeful Prophecy
That was the prophecy—and the
hope—expressed on the campus last i
night by members of the economics
department as Congress, in voting
Franklin Roosevelt extraordinary
powers, placed in his hands a vir
tual dictatorship over the banking
system and the authority to expand
currency.
However, the reader must not
too quickly assume that the cherub
Prosperity is really around the
corner. Roosevelt might not as
sume the Mussolinian mantle.
Even if he does, there is the pos
sibility (hat inflation might not
"(ake"—industry might not accept j
the proferred aid.
There is a more dire possibility.
Over two billions are estimated hid
den away by hoarders. If all of this
money should descend upon the
market at once, the "mild" inflation
that Roosevelt is said to plan might 1
get out of hand.
Prices May Go Too High
Prices would then go too high.
The value of the dollar might really
be jeopardized.
Inflation might be likened to
poker. A gamble and pretty good
—if you win.
But twelve professors at Chicago
recently petitioned Hoover to in
stitute a policy of inflation. Can
twelve professors he wrong?
