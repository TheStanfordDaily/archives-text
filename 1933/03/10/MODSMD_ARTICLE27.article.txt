financial .situation has engendered the belief in some quar- !
tors thai the t'niversily is In a had wav.
Far beyond the memory of I tit* present student body, i
some twenty-three years ago, a devastating earthquake
struck the Quad; the outlook for a while was even darker
than today. And further back, forty years ago, when Mrs.'
Stanford was unsuccessfully trying to sell her jewels to
keep the I'diversity's doors open, the outlook could not
have been darker. i
Compared with these earlier periods of uncertainly and
dismay, today's economic embarrassment is but an op
portunity to display confidence in both national and local
administrations. Such confidence would seem to be well
based in both instances. Never during the last four years
has executive action in Washington been so immediate,
so decisive; for the lirsl time in four years, the I'niver- j
sity directing head is on the campus, in close contact with
its problems.
The. I'niversity has weathered storms in the past; there
is no factual evidence to show that it cannot weather this
i
one.
