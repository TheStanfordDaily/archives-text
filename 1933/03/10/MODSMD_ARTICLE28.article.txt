# A 						Chance to Spend That Last Four-Bit Piece
## 
### 
Tonight's depression dance, sponsored by the (Hoe Club,
will !>i the last effort litis quarter to aid needy students.
Plans for Ihe affair were laid before the advent of the
banking holiday but the committee decided to go ahead in
spite of the shortage of cash.
Cven though the banks are due to remain closed things
are not so bad and it will bo a perfect occasion to spend
that last four-bit piece likely to be seen in some time.
( hecks, fortunately, are also good. The lifty cents will
admit one couple or a single rough, while fifteen cents will
open Ihe door lo any member of the "f>()0".
It is hoped that this scale of prices will correct the un
ioriunate shortage of women which was a source of com
plaint at earlier depression dances. Profits of the dance
will go three-fifths lo Ihe relief fund and two-fifths to the
< ileo C.lub.
The basketball pavilion has been picked as the scene
of the hop, thus doing away with the necessity of paying
the Women's Cym $20 for a wax less floor and a tuneless
piano.
