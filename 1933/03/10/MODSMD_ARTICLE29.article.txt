# Calling Student Attention To an Extensive Sports Program
## 
### 
On tlie front page of this paper arc listed the sporting
events which will occur (luring the remaining portion of j
the present quarter. The Daily can do no more, after to-!
day, in urging students to attend and lend their support
to these athletic activities. In particular, the boxing card
which features Stanford and California mittinen next
I uesda\ night is worthy of all the free publicity which
an editorial column can provide.
Stanford has borne the endearing pseudonym of "conn- !
try club" for several years, principally because of the un- i
excelled excellence of its athletic equipment and enter
tainment. I lia I excellence, in turn, lias been the rsult of
an extensive B.A.C. program, directed primarily toward
Hit 4 student's benefit.
The M.A.C. has done remarkably well, in the face of
present economic stress, in maintaining the standard of
its physical education and intercollegiate athletic program.
I he slashes in minor sports budgets which have become
the accepted rule at several other Coast Conference uni
versities have not yet arrived at Stanford. At the present
lime it would not be surprising were the H.A.C. obligated 1
to make such slashes, but they will come as a last resort, if
I hey come at all.
