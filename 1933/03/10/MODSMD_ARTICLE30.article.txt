There is always gratifvingly entertaining news from
Los Angeles coming through the columns of the Dailtj Tro
jan.
i he latest refreshing hit is the news that even in such
depressing, hunk-closing days as these, I .S.('.'s annual
Panic Parade (its a dance) will have food and drink
and twice as much as last year's affair. Mighty dozen
doughnuts and eighty gallons ot cider for the Panic Pa
rade's celebrants.
I vpically Hollywood, moreover, arc the arrangements
made to rush the doughnuts direct from oven to dance- \
floor, warm. Hut the crowning touch of ingenuity is the I
cider "will bo served in two different flavors."
