## WOMEN SPEAK AND EX COMM. BACK FLIPS 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
A comedy in the spring quarter we
advocated Wednesday—that was be
; fore we knew that the Ex Comm.
I had pulled what is already called
| the "Burlesque Bungle." Of course,
j that was before we even dreamed
' that the Ex Comm. would violate
| its promise and give the Men's Hi-
Jinks the axe. But when attractive
j campus dramatic queens lay the
| "facts" before that august body, it
i probably should have beeri expected
j that they would weasle out of an
I obligation. Being trusting, I didn't
| expect it.
I still think that the comedy can
j be presented. But I also think that is
no reason for dinging the Hi-Jinks.
No one wants to prophesy what the
next quarter will bring. It is pos
sible to think of a situation in which
all student-body activities will have
to be cut. It is even passible to think
! of the University closing. But being
j young and hopeful, I think that the
I campus will be able to carry on.
The Hi-Jinks does not have to be
i staged in the elaborate manner of
j "1929 Junior Operas." It can* be put
I on in super-farce style with simple
j sets and drops—using principally
I those already in Dramatic Council
possession. Costumes can be old and
ragged—home-made and improvised.
I The Hi-Jinks can take on the at
j mosphere of a co-operative, old-
I fashioned "theatrical." It might be
come a rough's holiday with all seats
1 selling at 25 or 50 cents.
If the situation demanded such a
Hi-Jinks, it is clear that it would
not cut into the financial support of
| other more snooty types of enter

? tainment of which the spring comedy
and the Menuhin Concert would be
. prime representatives. Of course, if
i money is relegated to the Gobi
, Dinosaur-Egg class by next quarter,
I there will be neither room for play
' nor Hi-Jinks. That situation is not
■ imminent.
Now that the sweet aroma of per
fume has faded from Ex Comm. nos
l trils, and the persuasive cackle of
i the hens has left their ears, the Ex
Comm. should reconsider and rein
state the Hi-Jinks—at least pending
final action next quarter. If not, the
students will be forced to take more
. direct action. Petitions and special
elections are such annoying things.
The Ex Comm. should see that they
have made a promise of several
months' standing and have broken
• that promise. The situation Is as
simple as that. FLowery language
; cannot conceal the essential breach
of faith.
No less than 20 persons, I am told,
have spent hours and hours of time
in preparing scripts, relying all the
time on the Ex Comm. promise.
Imagine their reaction to this adroit
and rapid-fire side-stepping of a i
promise. It is more than side-step- i
ping; it is a direct back-flip—a re- '
verse-summersault that finds the Ex
Comm. squarely within the clawing
paws of a few dramatic hens.
That campus dramatics should rest
solely on a rough and tumble Hi- (
Jinks seems sad: and is not neces- .
sary. The Hi-Jinks should be put on ;
in some inexpensive manner if nec- j
essary—but staged some way. A |
trust should be kept.
