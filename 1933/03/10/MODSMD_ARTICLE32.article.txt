IN DEFENSE OF "FUNNY MEN '
The Editor, Sir:
The student committee appointed
I for replacing the Junior Opera with
another play, took it upon itself to
1 vote the new show as being a Men's
! Hi-Jinks. On that committee were
! three women, three men, and a
j chairman, supplemented by the Dra
j matic Director in an advisory role.
; This committee was surely repre
| sentative enough of the campus. The
j committee had its chance to present
i any show that it. saw fit. That same
j committee went so far as to make
! deadlines for the scripts of Men's
Hi-Jinks. Now after a month or
[ more has passed and the deadline
for the scripts is but a week off, the
Executive Committee abolishes such
a show. I'm sure that if more of the
people on that committee had tried
I to write a script or had spent the
last month doing so they surely
would not pass such a drastic de
cision.
| In their little meeting of the other
i evening, when the Ex Committee
! abolished thi.s student-written show,
i I have heard that the student man
j ager and one member of the Dra
| matic Council were the only ones
j who held out for previous decision
j made. The women present claimed
1 that a Men's Hi-Jinks was not fair
! to the co-eds. It strikes me very

I funny that these same members of j
the poor, suffering, '"down-trodden" \
group did not take this into con- |
sideration when they voted for a
Men's Hi -Jinks in the first place. In |
my opinion the Men's Hi-Jinks will 1
be one of the best drawing-cards of I
the quarter. It was originally in- j
tended to be a theatre-fund benefit. 1
It can easily be arranged so that the !
proceeds will go to the student fund j
in a hope to bring it out of the red. j
Let us not forget the people who
have spent time and energy in an I
effort to do something for the stu
dent-body and student activities. |
Remember this year they are work- j
! ing for nothing—there is no prize, J
merely the satisfaction of seeing
their name in print; they are work
j ing for us—the student-body. Why !
should their efforts be wasted be- '
i cause of a change of ideas? Author- 1
ity was given to write scripts; why
, backslide and change a definite 1
plan?
For lack of publicity our shows
have suffered. The papers would be i
glad to print news regarding our j
presentations in advance if someone
would see that the writeups were
in. In the past, unless a member of
the Daiyl staff came over to the As
sembly Hall and got a story, nothing
was put in. It should be a duty of
the Dramatic Council to appoint one I
man for publicity lo see that the i
Daily and all San Francisco news- j
papers get copy. They will be more
than glad to print it.

a show. I'm sure that if more of the
people on that committee had tried
I to write a script or had spent the
last month doing so they surely
would not pass such a drastic de
cision.
| In their little meeting of the other
i evening, when the Ex Committee
! abolished thi.s student-written show,
i I have heard that the student man
j ager and one member of the Dra
| matic Council were the only ones
j who held out for previous decision
j made. The women present claimed
1 that a Men's Hi-Jinks was not fair
! to the co-eds. It strikes me very

I funny that these same members of j
the poor, suffering, '"down-trodden" \
group did not take this into con- |
sideration when they voted for a
Men's Hi -Jinks in the first place. In |
my opinion the Men's Hi-Jinks will 1
be one of the best drawing-cards of I
the quarter. It was originally in- j
tended to be a theatre-fund benefit. 1
It can easily be arranged so that the !
proceeds will go to the student fund j
in a hope to bring it out of the red. j
Let us not forget the people who
have spent time and energy in an I
effort to do something for the stu
dent-body and student activities. |
Remember this year they are work- j
! ing for nothing—there is no prize, J
merely the satisfaction of seeing
their name in print; they are work
j ing for us—the student-body. Why !
should their efforts be wasted be- '
i cause of a change of ideas? Author- 1
ity was given to write scripts; why
, backslide and change a definite 1
plan?
For lack of publicity our shows
have suffered. The papers would be i
glad to print news regarding our j
presentations in advance if someone
would see that the writeups were
in. In the past, unless a member of
the Daiyl staff came over to the As
sembly Hall and got a story, nothing
was put in. It should be a duty of
the Dramatic Council to appoint one I
man for publicity lo see that the i
Daily and all San Francisco news- j
papers get copy. They will be more
than glad to print it.

The Editor, Sir:
The student committee appointed
I for replacing the Junior Opera with
another play, took it upon itself to
1 vote the new show as being a Men's
! Hi-Jinks. On that committee were
! three women, three men, and a
j chairman, supplemented by the Dra
j matic Director in an advisory role.
; This committee was surely repre
| sentative enough of the campus. The
j committee had its chance to present
i any show that it. saw fit. That same
j committee went so far as to make
! deadlines for the scripts of Men's
Hi-Jinks. Now after a month or
[ more has passed and the deadline
for the scripts is but a week off, the
Executive Committee abolishes such
a show. I'm sure that if more of the
people on that committee had tried
