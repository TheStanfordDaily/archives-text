# SONGS WITHOUT SENSE
## THE 						FABLE OF LITTLE BOY BLUE or FLIGHT OF THE SEASONS 
### OLD DR. ALGAR 
Ho rousted on fifth floor, Encina,
And weekly made rounds for a
cleaner
While spending the whole of Fall
quarter
In doing no things that he
oughter.
In Winter he took some pipe j
courses
But never could quote the right
sources.
He rarely attended his classes
And exes were "just for the
masses."
In Spring it gave daily canoeing
With ladies who went for his
wooing.
This colorful holiday wore on
Hut Time never bothered our
Moron.
In June he received a diploma
While walking around in a coma.
The thing had a beautiful label— |
No soap?—Ah but tliis is a fable!
