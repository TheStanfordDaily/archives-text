According to the papers, Babe
Ruth has not yet agreed to accept
his annual stipend for running
around a green lawn and poking a
stick at a ball four or five times each
sunny afternoon for six months of
the year that is as large as the
stipend delivered annually by the
nation's taxpayers to the President
for running around marble corridors
and poking loud noises at a radio
microphone.
The papers also state that 30,000
smackers per annum is the amount
that the 232-pound fat-hoy re
luscs to accept for his antics, and
although i dislike greatly to dis
parage my colleagues. It seems to
me that Ihe papers are overlook
ing a wondrous news story when
they do not feature on the front
page anyone these days who re
fuses to do anything for."0.000
smackers per annum.
1 assume, of course, that Mr. Ruth
is insist in;/ upon payment (when a
.sum is eventually decided upon) in
cash, a.s a check from even such a
munificent gentleman as Colonel Jake
Rupert would be a very unstable
form of remuneration. And Mr.
Ruth is not the kind to accept an
unstable form of remuneration, even
ii if is larger than 50,000 smackers
per annum.
II also notice that the plan has
been suggested to have all the
hall clubs in the American League
conti ibute secretly I<» Mr. Ruth's
salary, on the theory that his abil
ity to draw crowds enriches the
coffers of all the teams played by
the Yankees.
Tin same scheme could be applied
v/ilh most; beneficial results to Big
Time football, since the coffers of
various boards ol athletic control
are enriched whenever certain foot
ball stars are sure to play. Thus, on
the faithful promise to have Homer
Griffith in condition for every game,
Stanford might send a dozen text
looks down South to Mr. Griffith;
California might contribute a suit
of clothes with sox and tie to match;
Washington could he socked for a
check covering fraternity dues; and
poor little Occidental, being a sec
ond-class loot ball school, would be
glad to contribute a red and yellow
roadster.
The American League has also
considered trading Mr. Ruth to
another team in order to balance
the strength of the clubs in the
league, and this plan, too, with
some slight alterations, would be
practicable in football. If Ted Kite's

football coaches. Ernie returned to
school this quarter, and there was
some question as to whether or not
he had completed six quarters work.
The Physical Hygiene department
was all ready to send Nevers a card
asking him to come in and explain
why he had not signed up for a
required lower division physical
education course, when it was
l< arned that the All-American HAD
met the requirements.

According to the papers, Babe
Ruth has not yet agreed to accept
his annual stipend for running
around a green lawn and poking a
stick at a ball four or five times each
sunny afternoon for six months of
the year that is as large as the
stipend delivered annually by the
nation's taxpayers to the President
for running around marble corridors
and poking loud noises at a radio
microphone.
The papers also state that 30,000
smackers per annum is the amount
that the 232-pound fat-hoy re
luscs to accept for his antics, and

parage my colleagues. It seems to
me that Ihe papers are overlook

Rupert would be a very unstable
form of remuneration. And Mr.
Ruth is not the kind to accept an
unstable form of remuneration, even
ii if is larger than 50,000 smackers

salary, on the theory that his abil
ity to draw crowds enriches the
coffers of all the teams played by
the Yankees.
Tin same scheme could be applied
v/ilh most; beneficial results to Big
Time football, since the coffers of
various boards ol athletic control
are enriched whenever certain foot
ball stars are sure to play. Thus, on
the faithful promise to have Homer
Griffith in condition for every game,
Stanford might send a dozen text
looks down South to Mr. Griffith;
California might contribute a suit
of clothes with sox and tie to match;
