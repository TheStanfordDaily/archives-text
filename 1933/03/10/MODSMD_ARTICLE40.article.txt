# U.C.-Card Boxing Meet Will Feature La Barba
## EX-CHAMP TO BOX HARRY MALONEY IN EXHIBITION MATCH 
### 
Featuring a two-round exhibition
bout between Fidel Laßarba, former
flyweight champion of the world,
and Harry Malomy, Stanford box
ing coach, the Cardinal mittmen will
meet California Tuesday evening in
the Pavilion in an attempt to avenge
an early-season 7-4 Bear victory.
The matches will find Captain Fred
Glover and Jim Feely, two of the
best fighters in Stanford history, in
their last battles for the Cardinal.
Counter-punching Feely expects
to repeat his win over John Jan.
California captain. And Glover,
long-feared by Stanford's oppon
ents, hopes to end his career with
a kayo triumph.
Easily the hardest-hitting light
heavyweights in collegiate ranks,
Stanford's Keith Topping and Mario
Pozzo of California, tangle in what
may prove the deciding bout of ihc
evening.
Stanford's consistent junior mid
dleweights, Waldo Munduy and Os
car Baer, both hard-hitters, expect
to garner two Indian victories at the
expense of Don Smith and Marshall
Elvin.
Chances of Stanford winning a
team victory depend on a large
measure on whether John Huston
can upset Stanley Goulard or
Newt Ridley can conquer George
Thurston, Rear knockout artist.
Phil Johnston, 220-pound Stan
ford heavyweight who lost to Milo
Mallory in the last California
matches, takes another crack at his
experienced Bear foe. John Fowler
boxes Guiseppe Deßisi, Bear mid
dleweight. Ben Cave will tangle with
welterweight Mandle Mierbach of
California, and veteran Yuji Imai.
meets an old friend in Ernest
Boucher, Bear 118-pounder. Boucher
won by a technical knockout in the
last meeting.
Admission charges for the bouts
have been reduced to 25 cents for
students and 55 cents for the gen
eral public.
