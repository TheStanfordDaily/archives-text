# CARDINAL POLO TEAM TO PLAY SAN JOSE HERE
## 
### 
Promising a better game than last
week's with San Mateo, the Stan
ford horsemen will meet the San
Jose Polo Club at 3 o'clock tomorrow
afternoon on the highway field.
With the two teams rated by Captain
Dick Gordan as '"just about on a
par," plenty of hard-riding action
will probably be forthcoming. Ad
mission will be free.
The same lineup that saw service
for Stanford last week will start to
morrow's game. Lupe Luppen and
Woody Melone will play at num
bers one and two, while Pat Robb
and Johnny Myers will hold down
the three and four positions. Show
ing rapid improvement in his first
year as a regular, Luppen turned in
the outstanding game for Stanford
last week. Robb, in. his first compe
tition, also played well. Melone and
Myers, somewhat off their game
against San Mateo, have shown up
well in recent practice sessions and
are expected to flash their old-time
form tomorrow.
San Jose's lineup will include Jeff
Armsby, Bill Gilmore, Charley Mc-
Cormiek, and a newcomer named
Meredith, who has already had con
siderable experience in peninsula
polo circles.
