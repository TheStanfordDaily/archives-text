# Babes Oppose J.C. On Cinders
## 
### 
With two meets under their belts
and four more ahead of them, Coach
Bill Ellington s enterprising frosh
spikemen meet the powerful Sacra
mento J.C. outfit on the practice
track at 10:15 tomorrow.
Their opponents are expected to
be superior to the frosh, which
should be just what the virtually
untried Papooses need. Such men as
Nimmo, Kingsbury, Grayson, Leedy,
Reynolds, and Klopstock will at last
be furnished real competition.
Nimmo, the star miler, in particu
lar, should relish a tilt with a good
distance man rather than leading
opponents in by a quarter lap.
Pointing for the Little Big Meet
of April 14, which they have given
every indication of being able to
win, the freshmen will have a real
test of strength tomorrow.
