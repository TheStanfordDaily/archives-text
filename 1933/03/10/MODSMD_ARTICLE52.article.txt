# Netmen To Open Play At S.C. During Spring Recess
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity netmen will
join the cavalcade of ruggers and
baseball players going South during
spring vacation.
The conference schedule calls for
a match against Southern California,
and Coach Sherman Lockwood will
have his first six players down on
the Southern courts for their first
conference battle.
On March 18. the March Field
aviators fly up to the Stanford cam
pus to play a match. They played
at Berkeley lust week, where they
were defeated by the Bears six
matches to two. However, in Dolph
Mulheisen, former Intercollegiate
doubles holder, and Cliff Robinson,
they have two men who will give
the Card players some trouble.
