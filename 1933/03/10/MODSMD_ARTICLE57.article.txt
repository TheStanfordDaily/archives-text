THE SEASON—A glance at produc
tions announced for the immediate
future.
"Counsellor-at-Law" (Elmer Rice)
opens next Sunday at the Alcazar.
In manuscript the play is not an im
portant addition to the body of
American drama but, if well pro
duced, will be a rapid, well-sustained
and entertaining melodrama. The
cast is large, demands careful cast
ing and shrewd direction. Otto Kru
ger is to play the leading role. It
offers a fine chance for characteriza
tion. Elizabeth Wilbur, Stanfordite,
is in the cast.
"The Wayfarers," a small subscrip
tion group, opens a courageous pro
duction of Ben Johnson's Vopone in
their small theatre at 74 Commercial
Street, San Francisco, on March 16.
I have not, thus far, been able to
see any of the group's productions
but their purpose—the production of
original or seldom-seen plays—is a
commendable one.
While the play is far too long to
play uncut and contains a good
many dull scenes with its brilliant
ones, the production should be in
teresting, particularly if Jack Thom
as, the director, has been able to
find a hardy cast capable of playing
broad and subtle humor.
Louis O. Mac Loon is said to be
casting "The Hand in the Fog" (Lon
don: "The Squeaker"; New York:

"Sign of the Leopard") by Edgar
Wallace for production about March
20 at an unnamed theatre.
Edward Custer of Carinel will
present Peg Randall Converse and
Vallejo Gantner in "Beggar on
Ho rsehack" (Kaufmann and Con
nelly) at the Community Play
house beginning March 17. The
play, first produced in 1924, is a
mad satire and a good one. The
appearance of these two Stan
fordites should be of consider
able interest to campus audiences.
There seems to be little of real
worth in prospect for the cinema.
"Cavalcade," an outstandingly fine
film, is being road-showed. After the
welcome recent appearance of near
ly a dozen fine pictures the movie
industry seems to have little that is
startling to offer.
A musical film. "Forty-Second
Street," is novel, "King of the Jun
gle" (to be seen soon at the Stan
ford) has received praise as an ima
ginatively-handled if thoroughly
nonsensical melodrama, "Our Bet
ters" (Maugham), a highly-rated
comedy of some seasons ago, has
been recorded and stars Constance
Bennett.
The Filmarte Theatre continues to
show foreign films of Varying worth.
The current "Rome Express" is said
to be an excellent melodrama. It was
made in England, and stars Conrad
Veidt. —Sandoe
