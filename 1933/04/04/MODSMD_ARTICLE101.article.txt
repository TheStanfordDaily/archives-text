# FACULTY INCOMES OVER $1000 TAKE SLASH NEXT FALL
## 
### 
Stanford professors and instruc
tors whose income is now more
than a thousand dollars a year will
receive 10 per cent less next fall,
unless the University's income
should exceed the amount expected,
according to action taken by the
Board of Trustees at the end of last
quarter.
A statement by President Ray
Lyman Wilbur, issued March 17,
says that "At the meeting of the
Board of Trustees of Stanford Uni
versity on March IG, 1933, the Pres
ident's budget for the academic
year 1933-34, as submitted by Presi
dent Wilbur, and the Comptroller's
budget, as submitted by Comptrol
ler Poth, were approved. Because
of the uncertain financial situation,
salaries of $1000 a year or over were
reduced 10 per cent, with the un
derstanding that should the Uni
versity's income exceed present ex
pectations a proportional distribu
tion will be made to those whose
salaries have been reduced. The
present pension system and pay
ments to the Teachers Insurance
and Annuity Association remain as
in the past."
The budget for the year 1933-34
goes into effect with the beginning
of next autumn quarter.
