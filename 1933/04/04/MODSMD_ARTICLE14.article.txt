# See Usual Fall In Registration
## 
### 
Despite unofficial surmises that
spring registration would fall off al
most 20 per cent, estimates made
today from incomplete figures at
the Registrar's Office indicate that
the fall in registration will be no
greater than the usual drop from
winter to spring quarter.
Statistics for the first day's regis
tration are not yet available, but,
60 far as could be seen, the decline
of total enrollment, as compared
with the winter quarter, was about
the same as was shown between the
two quarters last year. This decline
is due largely to the fact that no
new Lower Division students are
admitted in the spring.
