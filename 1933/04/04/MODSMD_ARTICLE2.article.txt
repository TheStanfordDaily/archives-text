# Vacation Showers Raise Lake And Rainfall Total
## 
### 
Rains that damaged the alleged
joys of a spring vacation spent on
the Farm not only contributed a
little .over one inch to the seasonal
rainfall total last week, but poured
42,000,000 gallons of San Franeisquito
water into Lagunita and extended
its period of usefulness about three
weeks.
The level of the Farm's lagoon had
been dropping steadily until the re
cent rains. Today it is full, and, ac
cording to James W. McDonnell, as
sistant superintendent of buildings
and grounds, Lagunita will serve for
canoeing and swimming until about
May 1.
