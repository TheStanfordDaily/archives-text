# Beer Garden? City Attorney Says 'No-no-no'
## And the 'Road To Mayfield' Leads to Palo Alto 
### 
Waning hope that Mayfield and
Menlo beer gardens of yore would
be revived when sale of beer is
legalized after April 7 was com
pletely blasted yesterday by Arnold
Rumwell, Palo Alto city attorney.
After thoroughly checking an ear
lier statement concerning the sale i
of beer in Palo Alto, Rumwell said
that in his opinion it was legally j
impossible to sell, manufacture, or
distribute the 3.02 per cent beer,
first card of President Roosevelt's I
j New Deal.
Mayfield Now Palo Alto
Since Mayfield is no longer a city
j under its own name, but a suburb
of Palo Alto, it will come under the
city charter provision that makes it j
unlawful to maintain a place whei'e
"spirituous, vinous, malt or intoxi
cating liquors or any admixture
thereof or alcoholic drinks what
soever are sold, kept for sale, of
fered for sale, furnished, distributed, |
divided, delivered or given away." I
Menlo beermen will be restricted
by the state Penal Code which pro
vides that no vinous or alcoholic |
liquors may be sold within one and ;
one-half miles of any university
grounds. A measure is now pend
ing before the state legislature to :
reduce this limit to one-half a mile.

Regardless of the fact that the 1
Supreme Court ruled that 3.02 per
cent beer is not intoxicating, the
sale of the same will be prohibited
because the charter and the Penal
Code are worded to include not only
intoxicating |liquors but alcoholic
liquors, Rumwell said.
