# Milk Bottles, Cocktail Classes Raised on Stanford's Toast to April 7

As city sinarl-alecks, baseball hooters, and others of
llieir ilk arc won I !o say, "You can lake the hoy off the
('arm, hut you can't lake the farm off the hov.' I his week,
as the campus smarl-alecks, philosophy majors, and what
not will he overheard lo vouchsafe, "Try as they will to
keep beer away Irom the Stanford man, lliey can never
keep the Stanford man away from beer."
Of course, that's neither here nor there. No one seri
ously believes that anyone else is seriously considering
Irving lo make the Stanford man's, or woman's, occasional
imbibing of the legalized beverage either a misdemeanor
under the University rules or "conduct unbecoming."
Whether or not beer is to be sold on the Stanford campus
appears to be oul of the hands of even the I Diversity
administration, which offered a section of the Calilornia
Penal ('ode as the reason for the local "no beer" edictum.
The student governing and judiciary bodies may find
themselves in the unwelcome predicament of having to
declare, themselves "wet" or "dry" one of these days, for
the A.S.S.I', by-laws state thai "the possession, transporta
tion, or use of intoxicating liquors by Stanford students
in the I Diversity community, or elsewhere, shall be
grounds for expulsion from the University." .lust what the
Men's Council would do in the case of a man who, by hook
or crook, contrived to become obnoxiously intoxicated on
Ihe beer which Congress defines as unintoxicating is prob
lematic. The Council, by enforcing the letter of the A.S.S.U.
by-laws, would definitely align itself with the rabid drvs,
who have insisted all along that anything containing alco
hol is intoxicating.
On the much more likely other hand, however, the
Council will never meet the situation. There is no reason
lo believe that Council members who have been tripping
over intoxicated Stanford men here and there in San Fran
cisco and on Hie Peninsula for the past four years will be
come any more observant of the letter of "what is the law"
under the new scheme of things.
Meanwhile, the campus awaits 12:01 a.m., April 7, but
in a manner which would surprise Washington agitators,
both wet and dry, who have been pointing to the vague
"American youth" as the best argument for this or that
stand on the heer and prohibition questions.
The vast majority of Stanford students arc, of course,
unmoved by the return of beer, just as they were unmoved
by the banking holiday, the bonus marches, and other inci
dents of history in the making. Some, having grown up
in the speakeasy atmosphere so thoughtfully provided bv
a prohibitionist parent generation, merely turn up their
noses at the thought of any beverage with an alcoholic
content so low as 1J.2 per cent. Some, those who seize upon
any excuse for relaxation and celebration, are planning
llieir parties for Friday night as follows: "We'll tear up to
the city and make the rounds of Joe's, Frank's, Hill's, and
George's, lake on a flock of old-fashioncds, and then whip
down to the hotel at midnight lo have a free glass of beer
on Ihe house."

a prohibitionist parent generation, merely turn up their
