# Dirty Cracks on the Departure of G. B. S., the "Great Irish Wit"
## 
### 
The great (ieorge Bernard Shaw lias come to the Pacific
('.oast and gone, leaving puzzled interviewers, weeping
movie stars, and a fawning public in his wake.
lint is the public actually fawning? Isn't it, rather, fall
ing all over itself Irving to appreciate the white-bearded
sage and his wit? Or rather, again, trying to appear to
appreciate Shaw before the neighbors? The almost daily
skit of llie famous Irish writer never seems to pale on the
easy-going American public. He picks out one of the
plainly visible and honestly admitted "Yankee" faults,
makes a wheezy and decrepit poke at it, and sits back
smiling while the victim fawns upon him and asks for
more.
Shaw frequently observed, almost perennially during
recent years, that lie feared the consequences were he to
make a visit to the foiled States. The aged humorist re
marked that "there would be such a general rush lo the
spot where his foot had dented American soil" that great
confusion' would result.
But did (1. B. S. make such a hit in California? His
fellow-passengers on the boat by which he arrived ap
peared none too enthusiastic about him. in Hollywood he
became positively irascible during a conversation with one
of the movie colony's most charming and talented ac
tresses. In San Francisco he stated his very definite views
on the Moonev case, an act which has marked many an
other citizen and visitor as a bore. On the whole, Califor
nia probably decided that it liked its heroes better after
the American pattern conceited, yes, but becomingly shv
and unassuming in public.
I'lie I .C..L.A. student who drove Shaw from his ground
ed plane to town summed up the situation when lie said,
"I'll be darned it 1 can remember one thing he said that
was funny."
