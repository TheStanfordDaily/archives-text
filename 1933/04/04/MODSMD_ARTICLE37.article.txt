# BULL SESSION
## THE 						FEVER AGAIN 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
"Spring fever," once the special |
plaything and excuse of poeis and
lovers, is now a most common af
fliction. Every word-monger writes
about it at least once during the j
year. My usual dissertation on this j
subject could always be expected
about mid-terms of the spring quar
ter. But traditions must be broken.
The "New Deal" is here. The
changes are stupendous. Mrs. Roose
velt went horseback riding. And I
write about spring fever in April.
The future may be uncertain—
beset with reform and change. The
present is very clear. I have "Spring
Fever." The fact that I have it in
intermittently throughout the year
is inconsequential. What is "getting
into-the-swing" in autumn becomes
laziness in winter but is elevated to
"Spring Fever" during this quarter.
Spring fever is always accom
panied by hope. For the simple rea
son that it is easier to hope than to
worry or question. For example,
when I am lying on my back in the |
shade watching the sun through a 1
tracery of pink rose petals, I don't (
care about anything—except my
lemonade. How can I wonder what
will happen at the World Economic
Conference? I just hope; it's so easy.
I see where some people prophesy j
that America will bounce back. The
slogan is open to all sorts of thrusts.
Bounce where? Lying on my back, (

I I answer with true Rotarian lust—
bounce up of course. If I were to
sit up, I could query whether Amer
, ica will bounce back. If I ever could
struggle to my feet—l would be sure
| that the slogan is erroneous. Spring
j fever addicts are perpetually on
their backs and the world looks rosy
from the prone.
Try it if you doubt the eternal
truth of that statement. Who ever
saw a Communist denouncing any
i thing while lying on his back? It
just can't be done. If you can get a
blustering "red" to even sit down
at a dinner table, he is like as not
to tone down to a Socialist. It is only
on his feet that he becomes noisy.
' The obvious remedy for red riots is
! to line the streets with comfy cots.
But while I enjoy spring fever, I
dread the thought of its coming. I
know it will drain me down to an
inert hulk. While inert hulks enjoy
being inert hulks—the prospect when
viewed in a cold scientific light is
never appetizing. That is why I have
| broken precedent and written of
[ spring fever in April instead of May.
I don't want the prospect of hav
j ing to write about spring fever
hanging over me. These are stirring
I times—farmers, Hitler, Morgan,
Roosevelt, and everything covered
j with a prospective beer foam. If I
can't write about spring fever, it is
i a waste of time to contract the dis
: ease. Now I have immunized myself.

But while I enjoy spring fever, I
dread the thought of its coming. I
know it will drain me down to an
inert hulk. While inert hulks enjoy
being inert hulks—the prospect when
viewed in a cold scientific light is
never appetizing. That is why I have
| broken precedent and written of
[ spring fever in April instead of May.
I don't want the prospect of hav
j ing to write about spring fever
hanging over me. These are stirring
I times—farmers, Hitler, Morgan,
Roosevelt, and everything covered
j with a prospective beer foam. If I
can't write about spring fever, it is
i a waste of time to contract the dis
: ease. Now I have immunized myself.
"Spring fever," once the special |
plaything and excuse of poeis and
lovers, is now a most common af
fliction. Every word-monger writes
about it at least once during the j
year. My usual dissertation on this j
subject could always be expected
about mid-terms of the spring quar
ter. But traditions must be broken.
The "New Deal" is here. The
changes are stupendous. Mrs. Roose
velt went horseback riding. And I
write about spring fever in April.
The future may be uncertain—
beset with reform and change. The
present is very clear. I have "Spring
Fever." The fact that I have it in
intermittently throughout the year
is inconsequential. What is "getting
into-the-swing" in autumn becomes
laziness in winter but is elevated to
"Spring Fever" during this quarter.
Spring fever is always accom
panied by hope. For the simple rea
son that it is easier to hope than to
worry or question. For example,
when I am lying on my back in the |
shade watching the sun through a 1
tracery of pink rose petals, I don't (
care about anything—except my
lemonade. How can I wonder what
will happen at the World Economic
Conference? I just hope; it's so easy.
I see where some people prophesy j
that America will bounce back. The
slogan is open to all sorts of thrusts.
Bounce where? Lying on my back, (

I I answer with true Rotarian lust—
bounce up of course. If I were to
sit up, I could query whether Amer
, ica will bounce back. If I ever could
struggle to my feet—l would be sure
| that the slogan is erroneous. Spring
j fever addicts are perpetually on
their backs and the world looks rosy
from the prone.
Try it if you doubt the eternal
truth of that statement. Who ever
saw a Communist denouncing any
i thing while lying on his back? It
just can't be done. If you can get a
blustering "red" to even sit down
at a dinner table, he is like as not
to tone down to a Socialist. It is only
on his feet that he becomes noisy.
' The obvious remedy for red riots is
! to line the streets with comfy cots.
