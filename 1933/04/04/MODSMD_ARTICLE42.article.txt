STRANGE INTERLUDE (Metro)—
At the Stanford Theatre.
O'Neill's play makes a curious but
only occasionally moving film. What
has been lost in the transcription is
difficult to determine. In any case,
it does not possess the dignity or the
fox - ce of the original.
The asides, to begin with, were
spoken with all the vigor and emo
tion of the normal speech and ac
companied by appropriate facial
gestures. Partly because this con
vention has been relegated largely
to the vaudeville stage or to farce
and partly because of the vigor with
which they were spoken, these
asides tended toward the ludicrous.
In the stage production they were
spoken, necessarily at a distance—
which would blur facial gestures to
a comfortable minimum — but, as
well, in a monotone. Used in this
manner they seemed to incline less
toward the amusing and retained
the emotional quality, the bitterness
and turmoil which the author in
tended.
The cast played with complete sin
cerity, but mannerisms frequently
hindered or broke down the force of
situation, and made the film, for me,
a production capable of moving the
spectator only occasionally—notably

in the scene between Darrell and
his son at the birthday party. (A
scene which, incidentally, was the
weakest in the stage production.)
The players aged insofar as good
makeup was capable of making them
age; but their gesture and g.iit be
lied the wrinkles. This was particu
larly noticeable of Norma Shearer
who, in the scenes of middle age,
retained all the grace of youth.
A foe of type casting, I do realize
the necessity of obtaining players
who can, with voice, indicate their
character. Clark Gable's enunciation
is careless and sluggish. He failed
thereby to establish his character
clearly.
The picture is a difficult one to
judge. As an experiment it .should
be seen, its peculiarities well enough
established in mind that they will
not disturb an appreciation of its
merits. In utilizing the aside, the
producers began with a heavy han
dicap. The unfamiliar is too likely
to seem comic.
I have attempted to weigh the re
sults fairly but cannot honestly say
more for the film than that it was a
sincere effort to transfer into the
revealing light of close-up, a fine
tragedy. But sincerity is insufficient;
it is an attitude rather than a re

suit. The performance is not, ex
cept in a few scenes, moving; it
fails to build to the play's bitter
climax. A great part of the deficit
may, I think, be put down to tech
nical and directorial uncertainty in
the unique experiment. —San doe
