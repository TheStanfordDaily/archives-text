Visiting the campus is an alert-
I eyed gentleman with a Slavic cast
of countenance and a courtly man
i ner — Jaroslav Heyrovsky, Czecho
j slovakian inventor of ihe polar
| graph and lecturer for the Carnegie
j Endowment for International Peace,
[ the man who has found a pearl in
| the depression.
"There is no work now for highly
[ trained science students," explains
Professor Heyrovsky, "so they con
; tinue with research. Great progress
I is being made. You see, the inter
| ests of science profit from the de
i pression."
The Czech finds Stanford's semi
nars in advanced science very dif
j ferent from the European method of
individual work.
| "I think this American system
! makes science more vivid to the
j student. The co-operation in these

seminars is wonderful." Heyrovsky
went on to describe the "lonely"
nature of European study, saying
that the students attend lectures
regularly only when they are es
pecially interested in what the pro
fessor has to offer.
Admitting he was shocked by "the
tramping costumes" worn to class
! by Stanford men, Heyrovsky said
his students at Charles University,
Prague, always dress in conven
tional dark suits.
The polargraph, a product of 15
years' work, so far is used only for
analysis of liquids in the laboratory.
"After 15 years more, I expect to
have it perfected for industrial use,"
Heyrovsky stated. "Manufacturers
want a machine in which you drop
a dime in the slot and get the exact
purity, sugar or alcoholic content of
a liquid."
