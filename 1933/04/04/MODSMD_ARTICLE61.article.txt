# Spring Football Faces Lack Of End, Tackle Material
## VARSITY GRIDDERS IN 'NEW DEAL' AS STUFF GETS READY 
### 
The United States enjoyed its
"new deal" March 4 . The Stanford
football squad gels a new deal of
its own tomorrow, the date when
Coach Tiny Thornhill and his as
sistants, Ernie Nevers and Jim
Lawson, roll up their sleeves and
get down to serious business with
spring football.
Thirteen h Itcrmen, including
six regulars, are hist, and the loss
is most fell at the Hanking posi
tions, when; Todd, Doub, and C'ol
vin, ranking ends, and George
Grey, Grihben, and Rogers, tac
kles, have all departed.
Fast and scrappy Jim Moscrip,
fresh up from the great freshman
team, will be on hand trying for one
of the end posts, and Minekler,
Packard, and Ransom, last year's
varsity substitutes, will be among
the money players.
Here Laborde, regular tackle of
last season, and Ben Palamountain
and Ed Lottunich are the leading
contenders for the tackle positions,
and a host of likely men are coming
lip from the frosh and the Greys.
The center combination of Bates,
Corbus, and Kite will return intact,
but Bates and Kile will encounter
stiff opposition in their drive to i*e
tain their places. Wes Mailer, a 220-
pound threat from the Greys, will
dispute Bales' career. Muller may
be shifted to tackle, however.
Adams and Rouble are a spectac
ular pair from the frosh who will
give Kite trouble.
Sim appears the only hack who
is a cinch to retain his place, with
Bob Hamilton working opposite
him at right half. Reisncr and
Maentz are also making serious
bids for halfback positions.
Grayson, Hillman, and Stan An
derson are available for fullback,
and Kenny AfTlerbaugh and Frank
Alustiza are leading the candidates
for quarterback, a place left vacant
by the graduation of Gordon Camp
bell.
