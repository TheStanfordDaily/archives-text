come taxes of $2,380,200 reported on
March 31, the last day for filing re
turns, brought the total for the
month to $180,712,300, compared with
$195,410,800 a year ago.
The amount, however, does not
represent all returns filed because
many were mailed and would not be
counted until today. So officials be
lieve the Government still has a
chance of exceeding the amount col
lected during last March.
