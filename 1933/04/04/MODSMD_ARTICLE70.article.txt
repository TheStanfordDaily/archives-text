# WIGET WINS TWO NATIONAL TITLES IN MEET AT YALE
## 
### 
Stamping himself the outstanding
collegiate swimmer in America to
day, Ted Wiget, Stanford aquatic
ace, captured both the 220- and 440-
yard titles in the recent National
Intercollegiate Swimming champion
ships held in the Yale pool March
25 and 2G. He was the only swimmer
at the meet to take first in two
events.
Wiget, defending champion in the
quarter-mile, had little difficulty in
winning that event and establishing
a new record for the Yale pool of
4:58.2. His chief competition came
from James Cristy of Michigan, a
member of the American Olympic
team.
Surprise Win in 220
The Stanford flash surprised the
wise boys when he won the 220-yard
event, however. Captain A1 Hapke
of Yale had made sensational time
in winning his preliminary heat in
2:14.8 the day before and was heav
ily favored to cop the title. He led
all the way in the final race until
Wiget touched him out to wm by
inches in 2:IG fiat.
Only three schools, Rutgers, North
western, and Stanford, were able to
capture first places in two events,
the first two winning relay races for
their double victories. No team
scores were counted.
Two Seconds in A.A.U.
At the National A.A.U. champion
ships held in the New York Athletic
Club pool on March 31 and April 1,
Wiget nosed out Jack Medica, sen
sational 18-year-old, to take second
behind George Fissler's remarkable
2:13.6 in the 220, and again nosed
out Medica to place second in the
500-yard event which was won by
Ralph Flanagan, 15-year-old star
from Florida.
