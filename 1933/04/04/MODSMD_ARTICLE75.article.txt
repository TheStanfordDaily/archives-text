# FROSH TRACKMEN ADD VICTORIES TO LONG IN STREAK
## 
### 
Continuing their string of victo
ries, Coach Bill Ellington's impres
sive frosh tracksters have made two
startling conquests in the past fort
night.
The first victim was Sacramento
Junior College, a powerful and sup
posedly unbeatable outfit. The boys
from the capital fell fighting, with
the final score registering 62-59.
Then, weakened by finals and the
lack of several regular point-win
ners, the frosh were still potent
enough to down a team of San
Francisco high school stars.
Sam Klopstoek, less publicized
than some of the yearlings, was
high point man for the two meets
combined. His total was 21 for the
two meets. Nimmo and Calloway
were close behind with 18 digits
apiece to their credit.
Calloway Stars
Calloway was individual star in
the meet with the scholastic boys,
coming in ahead of a large field in
the shot, discus and javelin. Weight
men Leedy, Reynolds, and Hollo
way, all point winners in the Sac
ramento meet, were absent, and
Hudson filled the gap with seconds
in both weight events.
Kingsbury, who has been win
ning hurdle races in phenomenal
times, fell down in the last meet,
and Klopstoek romped home first
in both races.
Davis, running 51.8 seconds, was
tied for first in the quarter by a
jaysee man; he won in the clear
from the All-Stars. Dellinger came
in next in each case.
Nobs reached the long - sought
heights in the high jump in the
second meet. The mark was five
feet eleven inches. Cottrell was an
inch behind. Previously this duo
tied with two S.J.C. men at five feet
nine inches for first place.
