While Stanford's scholars spent
their vacation practicing for the im
minent modification of the Volstead
Act, Stanford's athletes spent their
vacation practicing for and engaging
in sundry meets, matches, and games.
For the edification of those who do
not peruse the sports pages of their
home newspapers and of those who
live in isolated hamlets, unreached
by modern means of communication,
the following is a synopsis of sports
events .since this Daily's distant pre
decessor.
The Stanford rugby squad car
ried off major vacation honors,
(raveling (o Los Angeles on its
own expense to meet and defeat
(he Hollywood All-Stars 25 (o (I
lor the undisputed rugby cham
pionship of the state. The play of
(he heavy Stanford team (featur
ing Ernie Caddel's 17 points) was
a revelation to the carthquaked
Southland.
Ben Palamountain and Bill Sim
each made a try and Thorny Rogers
added a conversion. For those who
can score a rugby game, that should
total 25 points. Palamountain and
Caddel were the game's stars, and
Ben's playing caused both Tiny
Thornhill and Ernie Nevers to sug
gest that he will be a much-im
proved tackle next fall in football.
A scheduled game with U.S.C. was
called off (by Stanford) because it
interfered wilh the S.C.-Cal track
meet. Had S.C., not Stanford, post
poned Ihe game, the cry up here
would be, "The Trojans fc*r a beat
ing."
Ted Wigct deserves mention
after the ruggers, as he won two
national in(ercollegia(e swimming
lilies. Compc(ing at New Haven,
Ted repeated his 1932 victory in
(he 440 and also won (he 220. His
time of 4:55.2 in (he quarter broke
the pool record. YViget (hen trav
eled (o New York for (he A..AU.
finals, and took seconds in the
220 and the 500, beating the young
sensation from Seattle, Jack Med
ica, in both races.

Although Ben Eastman broke a J
world's record, I disrespectfully put
him way down here because the |
breaking of world's records by Ben |
Eastman is such a common thing.
Captain Ben ran 600 yards in 1:09.2
last Saturday in a charity track meet
at Kezar sponsored by the Parent- j
Teachers Association. Lowe, Eng- j
land's great middle-distance ace, had |
run 1:10.4 in 5 B.E Before Eastman j
(192(5 to you).
The Kezar meet found Slinger ;
Dunn, who transferred to Stanford :
(his quar(cr from Menlo Junior j
College, winning tiie shot and fin- j
ishing second to Here Laborde in !
(he discus. Dunn, Laborde, Gray, j
and Lyman give Dink Templeton j
(he greatest weight-throwing (earn
in the country. Bill Miller and Bud
Deacon (ried for a new world's I
pole-vault record at Kezar, but
failed, Miller being handicapped
by (wo recently extracted teeth.
Featuring the play of Bill Ladue'
and Dick Miles in the outfield, the
barnstorming baseballers broke even
in four games. They licked the San ,
Diego Marines (i to 2 and then lost
5 to 6, and they defeated the Trojans
18 to 4 after losing to Trojan Captain
George Buchanan, 1 to 4.
Fred Heringer, who pitched in j
(lie first S.C. game, was (lie viclim j
of (oo much Buchanan. Bert Del
las, who was back i:i (lie best Del
mas form during the trip, handled j
12 chances without an error and j
Ladue got bis homer in the first !
San Diego game. Miles hit well in
the pinches in all four games; Mal
latratl's first-basing pleased Harry
Welter; and workhorse Harry
Starke pitched in three of the four i
games.
. . .
The tennis team lost in League j
play to S.C. and won a non-Confer- j
cnee practice victory from U.C.LA.
The score of the Trojan debacle was

4 to 5, the entire meet being de
cided by the final doubles match, in
which Hal Steiner and Jess Hillman
were 100 good for the second Stan
ford pair. Chuck Otis, number two
man, was the Cards' only quadruple
winner, defeating Phil Castlan of
S.C. and Captain Dick Froelich of
U.C.L.A. in singles, and then pairing
with Dan Ellis to win both his dou
bles matches. The 6 to 3 U.C.L.A.
win was nice, but it won't help the
Stanford racketeers' Conference
standing. —Dick Strouse j

Although Ben Eastman broke a J
world's record, I disrespectfully put
him way down here because the |
breaking of world's records by Ben |
Eastman is such a common thing.
Captain Ben ran 600 yards in 1:09.2
last Saturday in a charity track meet
at Kezar sponsored by the Parent- j
Teachers Association. Lowe, Eng- j
land's great middle-distance ace, had |
run 1:10.4 in 5 B.E Before Eastman j
(192(5 to you).
The Kezar meet found Slinger ;
Dunn, who transferred to Stanford :
(his quar(cr from Menlo Junior j

ishing second to Here Laborde in !
(he discus. Dunn, Laborde, Gray, j

pole-vault record at Kezar, but

Featuring the play of Bill Ladue'
and Dick Miles in the outfield, the
barnstorming baseballers broke even
in four games. They licked the San ,
Diego Marines (i to 2 and then lost
5 to 6, and they defeated the Trojans
18 to 4 after losing to Trojan Captain
George Buchanan, 1 to 4.
Fred Heringer, who pitched in j

of (oo much Buchanan. Bert Del

12 chances without an error and j

San Diego game. Miles hit well in
the pinches in all four games; Mal

Starke pitched in three of the four i
games.

The tennis team lost in League j
play to S.C. and won a non-Confer- j
cnee practice victory from U.C.LA.
The score of the Trojan debacle was

4 to 5, the entire meet being de
cided by the final doubles match, in
which Hal Steiner and Jess Hillman
were 100 good for the second Stan
ford pair. Chuck Otis, number two
man, was the Cards' only quadruple
winner, defeating Phil Castlan of
S.C. and Captain Dick Froelich of
U.C.L.A. in singles, and then pairing
with Dan Ellis to win both his dou
bles matches. The 6 to 3 U.C.L.A.
win was nice, but it won't help the

While Stanford's scholars spent
their vacation practicing for the im
minent modification of the Volstead
Act, Stanford's athletes spent their
vacation practicing for and engaging
in sundry meets, matches, and games.
For the edification of those who do
not peruse the sports pages of their
home newspapers and of those who
live in isolated hamlets, unreached
by modern means of communication,
the following is a synopsis of sports
events .since this Daily's distant pre
decessor.
The Stanford rugby squad car
ried off major vacation honors,
(raveling (o Los Angeles on its
own expense to meet and defeat
(he Hollywood All-Stars 25 (o (I
lor the undisputed rugby cham
pionship of the state. The play of
(he heavy Stanford team (featur
ing Ernie Caddel's 17 points) was
a revelation to the carthquaked
Southland.
Ben Palamountain and Bill Sim
each made a try and Thorny Rogers
added a conversion. For those who
can score a rugby game, that should
total 25 points. Palamountain and
Caddel were the game's stars, and
Ben's playing caused both Tiny
Thornhill and Ernie Nevers to sug
gest that he will be a much-im
proved tackle next fall in football.
A scheduled game with U.S.C. was
called off (by Stanford) because it
interfered wilh the S.C.-Cal track
meet. Had S.C., not Stanford, post
poned Ihe game, the cry up here
would be, "The Trojans fc*r a beat

and Dick Miles in the outfield, the
barnstorming baseballers broke even
in four games. They licked the San ,
Diego Marines (i to 2 and then lost
5 to 6, and they defeated the Trojans
18 to 4 after losing to Trojan Captain
George Buchanan, 1 to 4.
Fred Heringer, who pitched in j
(lie first S.C. game, was (lie viclim j
of (oo much Buchanan. Bert Del
las, who was back i:i (lie best Del
mas form during the trip, handled j
12 chances without an error and j
Ladue got bis homer in the first !
San Diego game. Miles hit well in
the pinches in all four games; Mal
latratl's first-basing pleased Harry
Welter; and workhorse Harry
Starke pitched in three of the four i
games.

The tennis team lost in League j
play to S.C. and won a non-Confer- j
cnee practice victory from U.C.LA.
The score of the Trojan debacle was

4 to 5, the entire meet being de
cided by the final doubles match, in
which Hal Steiner and Jess Hillman
were 100 good for the second Stan
ford pair. Chuck Otis, number two
man, was the Cards' only quadruple
winner, defeating Phil Castlan of
S.C. and Captain Dick Froelich of
U.C.L.A. in singles, and then pairing
with Dan Ellis to win both his dou
bles matches. The 6 to 3 U.C.L.A.
win was nice, but it won't help the
Stanford racketeers' Conference
standing. —Dick Strouse j
While Stanford's scholars spent
their vacation practicing for the im
minent modification of the Volstead
Act, Stanford's athletes spent their
vacation practicing for and engaging
in sundry meets, matches, and games.
For the edification of those who do
not peruse the sports pages of their
home newspapers and of those who
live in isolated hamlets, unreached
by modern means of communication,
the following is a synopsis of sports
events .since this Daily's distant pre
decessor.
The Stanford rugby squad car
ried off major vacation honors,
(raveling (o Los Angeles on its
own expense to meet and defeat
(he Hollywood All-Stars 25 (o (I
lor the undisputed rugby cham
pionship of the state. The play of
(he heavy Stanford team (featur
ing Ernie Caddel's 17 points) was
a revelation to the carthquaked
Southland.
Ben Palamountain and Bill Sim
each made a try and Thorny Rogers
added a conversion. For those who
can score a rugby game, that should
total 25 points. Palamountain and
Caddel were the game's stars, and
Ben's playing caused both Tiny
Thornhill and Ernie Nevers to sug
gest that he will be a much-im
proved tackle next fall in football.
A scheduled game with U.S.C. was
called off (by Stanford) because it
interfered wilh the S.C.-Cal track
meet. Had S.C., not Stanford, post
poned Ihe game, the cry up here
would be, "The Trojans fc*r a beat
ing."
Ted Wigct deserves mention
after the ruggers, as he won two
national in(ercollegia(e swimming
lilies. Compc(ing at New Haven,
Ted repeated his 1932 victory in
(he 440 and also won (he 220. His
time of 4:55.2 in (he quarter broke
the pool record. YViget (hen trav
eled (o New York for (he A..AU.
finals, and took seconds in the
220 and the 500, beating the young
sensation from Seattle, Jack Med
ica, in both races.

Although Ben Eastman broke a J
world's record, I disrespectfully put
him way down here because the |
breaking of world's records by Ben |
Eastman is such a common thing.
Captain Ben ran 600 yards in 1:09.2
last Saturday in a charity track meet
at Kezar sponsored by the Parent- j
Teachers Association. Lowe, Eng- j
land's great middle-distance ace, had |
run 1:10.4 in 5 B.E Before Eastman j
(192(5 to you).
The Kezar meet found Slinger ;
Dunn, who transferred to Stanford :
(his quar(cr from Menlo Junior j
College, winning tiie shot and fin- j
ishing second to Here Laborde in !
(he discus. Dunn, Laborde, Gray, j
and Lyman give Dink Templeton j
(he greatest weight-throwing (earn
in the country. Bill Miller and Bud
Deacon (ried for a new world's I
pole-vault record at Kezar, but
failed, Miller being handicapped
by (wo recently extracted teeth.
