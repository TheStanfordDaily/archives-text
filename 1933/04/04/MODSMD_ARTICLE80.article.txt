## CALIFORNIA LEADS LEAGUE AS CARDS HOLD NEXT PLACE 
### 
Returning from the South with an
even record of wins and losses,
Stanford's powerful baseball team
faces California's equal aggregation
on Wednesday and Saturday.
California is at the top of the
Pacific Conference standings with 5
wins and no losses. The Indians
rank second with a record of 3 vic
tories and 2 defeats. The two-game
series set for this week will there
fore have a direct bearing on the
winner of the conference race.
Indians Win, Lose
San Diego's marine squad offered
(he first competition to the Stanford
nine. In the opening encounter the
soldiers of the sea found themselves
on the short end of a 6 to 2 count.
Nothing daunted, the Marines came
hack with a G to 5 victory in the
second game.
The first game fujnd Ladue, who
played an excellent center field
throughout the trip, knocking the
well-known horsehide out for a
homer. Delmas played a stellar game
at short, making twelve stops with
out a single error. Stark, Heringer,
and Este.s all saw service in the
pitcher's box.
In the second tussle the Indians
came from behind with a four-run
rally in the ninth, which just fell
.short of sewing up the game. Miles
got three hits out of five trips to
the plate. Campbell and Stark held
up the pitching.
Trojans Win First
Next the ball club tackled the
well-advertised Trojans. With Cap
tain George Buchanan, among the
best of collegiate pitchers, holding
the Farm men to six hits, the S.C.
boys had little difficulty downing
the Indians 4-1. Holbrook, first base
men, collected three of the South- I
erners' nine hits, with but four times
at bat. Heringer chucked splendidly
for Stanford and was not far behind
Buchanan's standard.
Still smarting under the Trojan
win, and the optimistic predictions
of the enthusiastic Los Angeles !
sports scribes, the Indians came back
to win the second game with a siz
zling 18 to 4 score.
Delmas Stars
Seventeen hits were collected by
the enterprising ball club during the
massacre, and Forney of S.C. was j
jerked after allowing the major por
tion and three more pitchers fol- ;
lowed. Delmas led the batting with
four hits in four tries; Captain Liv
crmore followed with a three-out- 1
of-five record. I
The Trojans collected eight hits,
but slipped badly in the field with
eleven errors chalked up against
them.
Delmas seems to have returned lo j
his good form so noticeable last year,
but not displayed until recently this
season.
