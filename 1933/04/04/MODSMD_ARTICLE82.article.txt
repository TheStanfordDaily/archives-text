# Rugby Club Wins In South
## 
### 
A lot of nervous energy ex
pounded during winter quarter
finals week by the Stanford Rugby
Club was loosed at the expense of
the Hollywood Club March 25, dur
ing vacation.
The Stanford team which ran
madly through the Hollywood
team to win 25-0 was described
as the roughest, toughest bunch
of wildmen ever seen in the
southern section. Led by big and
fleet Ernie Caddel. who person
ally scored 17 of his team's 25
points, the Stanford crew simply
smothered their opponents.
The festivities had hardly begun
when Caddel scored his first try
and missed the conversion. Shortly
after Bill Sim went over for a try,
and then Ben Palamountain sped on
a sixty-yard dash that carried him
over for a try. Caddel converted
both scores, and near the end of
the thirty-five minute quarter made
a beautiful drop-kick that counted
for four more Stanford points.
The Cards coasted through the
second half, and watched Holly
wood play a hard defensive game.
Caddel had one more ,big moment
and made the score 23-0 with his
third try of the day. For variety,
Thorny Rogers kicked (lie las(
goal after try.
Members of the Stanford Club
who made the trip were: Gill, John
son, Brown, Palamountain, Tatum,
Keller, Rogers, Lewis, Cleaveland,
Chuck White, Sim, Shorts, Caddel,
Reisner, Holmes, Avery, Cotton, and
White.
