# EASTMAN BREAKS 600 YARD RECORD IN CHARITY MEET
## 
### Oliver Johnston 
The legs of Ben Eastman worked
overtime for charity in San Fran
cisco Saturday, and brought another
world's record to the Farm. Running
in the feature race of the San Fran
cisco Parent-Teachers Association
meet, Stanford's speediest stepper
! streaked off GOO yards in 1:09.2,
trumping D. G. A. Lowe's record by
one and a fifth seconds. Lowe's rec
ord was made in 1926.
A five-mile breeze registered on
the Kezar Stadium wind gauge in
j dicates that Blazin' Ben's latest
record will be invalidated. But
since Eas(man ran most of the
race against (he wind, John El
liott, Pacific Association official,
believes (he mark may be accep(ed.
Eastman's mad dash eclipsed the
surprising pole-vault victory of Bud
Deacon over Olympic Champion Bill
Miller; Gordon "Slinger" Dunn's win
; over John Lyman and Here Laborde
in the shot put; and Cotto Herbert's
23.8 second victory in the low hur
dles.
Deacon vaulted 13 feet, 6 inches,
I six inches higher than Miller, while
Dunn reached 49 feet, 4% inches in
winning the shot. Dunn competed
unattached in Satui'day's meet but
his hefty arms are now eligible to
j compete for Stanford, as are the
speeding legs of sprinter Les Hables,
who streaked off several hundred
yard dash time trials over the va
cation in less than 10 seconds.
Notwithstanding (lie "miracle
man" coaching of Brutus Hamil
ton. California suffered its annual
licking at the hands of U.S.C. For
the first time in four years, the
Trojans were held to less than 100
points, but the Southern California
; squad tha( compe(ed Saturday was
something of a second-string out
fit.

Runners were "juggled" in almost
every event, so that the Trojan aces
were competing in events new to
them. Charley Parsons, Jr., and Les
Ball, who flashed to a one-two vic
tory in the 100, were kept out of the
220, allowing two more Trojan
sprinters, Harry Tompkins and Alf
Koenig, to grab the pay-off places.
In the 440, Olympic veteran Ed Ab
lowich cut in on California's white
hope quarter-miler Jim Van Loben
Scls, causing his own disqualifica
tion and crediting "Cotton" War
burton of football fame with a 49.8
second victory.
Most surprising of the track up
sets was (he defea( of sophomore
Ferris Webster in (he half-mile by
California's Reynolds. Always an
in-and-outcr, smooth-riding Web
ster bad one of his off days and
was clocked in 1:58.2. Chances are
he will shave a full six seconds
off this mark when he faces Ben
Eastman in their race three weeks
hence.
