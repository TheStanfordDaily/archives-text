# Netmen Beat Bruins But Falter Before Trojaus
## 
### 
Stanford's traveling tennis team ]
came up from the South with a
none-too-impres.sive score of one
victory and one defeat in their
matches with the Uclans and with
U.S.C.
The only setback to Coach Lock
wood's ambitious plans for the re
mainder of the net season was the
report of the Committee on Scholar
ship, which will keep Jack Cosgrove
from any further tennis competition
for the Cards.
Against the Bruins, Stanford won
a 6-3 match victory which might
easily have been more one-sided.
The team functioned well, and al- I
though the feature match of the day
was won by Tidball over Captain Joe !
Coughlin, in scores of (5-4, 6-1, in a 1
closely contested battle, the Cards
were obviously the better balanced
team in the remaining matches.
Other results were: Briggs defeated
Blethen (S), 6-2, 6-4; Lee (S) de
feated Myers 6-3, 3-6, 6-2; Otis (S)
defeated Froelich 6-3, G—4; Cosgrove
(S) defeated Parsons 6-4, 6-4; and
Reed (S) defeated Miller 6-2, 6-4.
In the doubles, Coughlin and Cos
grove lost to Tidball and Froelich,
13-11, 6-3; Lee and Read defeated
Briggs-Myers 6-3, 6-3, and Otis and
Ellis (S) won handily over Parsons
and Miller, 6-2, 9-7.
Southern California reversed all

i the dope when they took the Cards
into camp by the narrow score of
5 matches to 4. Had Captain Joe
Coughlin been playing his usual
steady game the outcome wouldn't
have been in any doubt, but if's can
not change the conference standings
now.
The Southern coach did some
fancy shifting of players, and re
sults pitted lower ranking players
into feature matches, concentrating
the Trojan strength where they most
needed the matches.
Bob Cahill, formerly Bob Little of
conference experience, defeated
Coughlin (5-4, 4-6, (i-2 in an exceed
; ingly hard-fought match. The real
i feature match of the series, how
ever, brought Sam Lee against Jess
Millman, ranking Southern Califor
nian. Millman won (5-4, 7-5, but had
a hard job against young Lee. The
other results were: Chuck Otis (S)
defeated Phil Castlen (5-3, 3-4; Jack
Cosgrove (S) defeated Phil Wool
edge (5-3, 6-1; and Harold Steiner
defeated Glen Reed (S) (i-4, 4-6, 6-3.
In the doubles, Sastlen-Cahill won
over Cosgrove-Coughlin, 6-3, 3-6,
6-1; Otis-Ellis defeated Wooledge-
Lindsey 6-2, (5-0; and Steiner-Mill
i man beat Lee-Reed (S) in a spark
ling match to decide the team victor,
6-3, 7-5.

Stanford's traveling tennis team ]
came up from the South with a
none-too-impres.sive score of one
victory and one defeat in their
matches with the Uclans and with
U.S.C.
The only setback to Coach Lock
wood's ambitious plans for the re
mainder of the net season was the
report of the Committee on Scholar
ship, which will keep Jack Cosgrove
from any further tennis competition
for the Cards.
Against the Bruins, Stanford won
a 6-3 match victory which might
easily have been more one-sided.
The team functioned well, and al- I
though the feature match of the day
was won by Tidball over Captain Joe !
Coughlin, in scores of (5-4, 6-1, in a 1
closely contested battle, the Cards
were obviously the better balanced
team in the remaining matches.
Other results were: Briggs defeated
Blethen (S), 6-2, 6-4; Lee (S) de
feated Myers 6-3, 3-6, 6-2; Otis (S)
defeated Froelich 6-3, G—4; Cosgrove
(S) defeated Parsons 6-4, 6-4; and
Reed (S) defeated Miller 6-2, 6-4.
In the doubles, Coughlin and Cos
grove lost to Tidball and Froelich,
13-11, 6-3; Lee and Read defeated
Briggs-Myers 6-3, 6-3, and Otis and
Ellis (S) won handily over Parsons
and Miller, 6-2, 9-7.
Southern California reversed all

i the dope when they took the Cards
into camp by the narrow score of
5 matches to 4. Had Captain Joe
Coughlin been playing his usual
steady game the outcome wouldn't
have been in any doubt, but if's can
not change the conference standings
now.
The Southern coach did some
fancy shifting of players, and re
sults pitted lower ranking players
into feature matches, concentrating
the Trojan strength where they most
needed the matches.
Bob Cahill, formerly Bob Little of
conference experience, defeated
Coughlin (5-4, 4-6, (i-2 in an exceed
; ingly hard-fought match. The real
i feature match of the series, how
ever, brought Sam Lee against Jess
Millman, ranking Southern Califor
nian. Millman won (5-4, 7-5, but had
a hard job against young Lee. The
other results were: Chuck Otis (S)
defeated Phil Castlen (5-3, 3-4; Jack
Cosgrove (S) defeated Phil Wool
edge (5-3, 6-1; and Harold Steiner
defeated Glen Reed (S) (i-4, 4-6, 6-3.
In the doubles, Sastlen-Cahill won
over Cosgrove-Coughlin, 6-3, 3-6,
6-1; Otis-Ellis defeated Wooledge-
Lindsey 6-2, (5-0; and Steiner-Mill
i man beat Lee-Reed (S) in a spark
ling match to decide the team victor,
6-3, 7-5.
