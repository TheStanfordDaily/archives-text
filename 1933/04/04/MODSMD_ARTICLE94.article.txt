# "WE WON'T FIGHT’ DECLARES PACIFIST STUDENT MEETING
## 
### 
Pacifistic in theory, but not cer
tain of their reactions if war should
break out, is the attitude of Stanford
students who were asked their opin
ion of the resolutions adopted by the
Intercollegiate Conference Against
War which was in session on this
campus during the past week-end.
The group, composed of eighty dele
gates from nine Bay region col
leges, officially declared that "We
won't fight for a damn thing—nei
ther for country nor in any class
war."
Commenting upon the work of
the Conference, Mary Kathcrine
Morris, president of A.W.S., said,
"I doubt if such conferences will
have much effect when war is de
clared but it is very idealistic and
the delegates might get something
out of their discussion."
Jack Redhead stated that although
he was a pacifist, he felt that no
one could be sure of what course
would be taken in time of war. He
declared that his attitude would de
pend upon the causes and circum
stances.
While many Stanford students ad
mitted that benefits might be ob
tained from the Conference, they
condemned it for considering a reso
lution v/hich proposed that the fri
gate Constitution, then in San Fran
cisco harbor, be taken out to sea
and junked. The motion was de
feated, 56 to 12.
"This resolution was brought up,"
explained Sheldon Osburn, Stanford
graduate student who was chair
man of the Conference, "because we
felt that the Constitution was
spreading wartime propaganda in
its nation-wide tour."
