Yes, sir —here's a way to Europe that j
ranks with 1933's best bargains! Pay only
the low Tourist Class rate and enjoy
"top class" on the Red Star liners !
Pennland, Waternland, Mimieuaska and
Aiinneto/ika. The former two were Cabin
ships and the latter two recently carried '
passengers only in First Class.
And now their best staterooms, broadest
decks, loveliest public rooms, are yours
at a fraction of the former cost. No won- j
der travelers who are "in the know" are
saying' This is the new-dayTouristClass." ;
