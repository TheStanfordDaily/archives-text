The extensive application of the
independent study plan to the Lower
Division last year was markedly
successful.
"Work upon the independent
study projcct has served to stimu
late interest in teaching among the
members of the instructing stall,"
states Professor Edgar E. Robin
son, chairman of the Committee on
Independent Study. "It lias brought
the subject-matter of the various
courses under careful scrutiny by
departments and instructors."
High capacities have been re
vealed among superior students, and
experimentation 'with individual
work has indicated ways in which
the quantity of work required of
these intellects may be changed.
The trial was conducted under the

grant of the General Education
Board. It was especially directed to
; ward the selection of students for
! Upper Division independent study,
i Individual work was made possible
in the departments of economics,
English, history, political science,
and psychology. One-third of the
students in the Lower Division took
| one or more courses on the inde
pendent plan, the largest enrolment
being in English composition under
John McClelland.
A significant result of the experi
ment has been the evolution of a
new type of Upper Division inde
pendent work aimed at continuing
j and enlarging the field of study en
gaged in during the first two years,
i with a minimum of specific courses
J required.
