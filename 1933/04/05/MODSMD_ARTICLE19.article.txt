## 
### 
Enrollment figures released last
night by the Registrar's Office at the
close of the second day of registra
tion indicate that the usual drop
from winter to spring quarter is less
this year than in 1932 despite pre
dictions of University officials to the
contrary.
A drop of 254, or 8 per cent, from
winter to spring quarter, is shown
by the incomplete statistics now
available, while a drop of 362, or 10
per cont, was seen in 1932. This drop
is to be expected because of the fact
that no new lower division students
are admitted in the spring quarter,
the Registrar's Office stated.
The enrollment total last night was
2823 as compared with 3058 in 1932,
revealing a loss of 235 students. The
Registrar's Office points out that this
loss is less than the loss of 319 seen
in comparison of the two winter
quarters, or tho drop of 343 seen in
the comparisons of the quarters.
