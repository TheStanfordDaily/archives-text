NEW YORK, April 4 (/!>)—Lieu
tenant Commander H. V. Wiley,
second in command of the ill-fated
navy dirigible Akron, told his own
story to newspapers late today.
"We left Lakehurst at about 7:30
p.m. last night on a regularly sched
uled flight," he said.
"One object was to calibrate
radio direction finding stations in
New England."
Wiley said that calibration of the
New England stations could not be
gin until it was daylight, and as it
was foggy, it was decided to cruise
inland, where the ground could be
seen.
Headed Toward South
We were over Philadelphia about
8:10 o'clock last night," he said,
"headed south, following the Dela
ware river. It was expected there
would be no fog south of New Jer
sey and that the log at sea would
clear in the morning."
"About 8:35 o'clock," he said,
"when twenty miles south of Phila
delphia, lightning was seen ahead.
"In a few minutes we had reports
of a thunderstorm over Washington.
Begins Swift Fall
"The ship was traveling at an alti
tude of 1600 feet. The course was
changed to avoid the storm, but after
half an hour the ship began to de
scend rapidly.
"I dropped all the ballast for
ward," said Wiley, in telling tersely
of his battle against the elements.
"The fall was stopped at about 800
feet.
The ship rose, but in a few mo
ments "the air became turbulent
all around us and the ship tossed
violently."
Wiley called all hands to the
"landing stations" because, he said,
lie knew the ship was near the cen
ter of the storm and he wanted to
"have them all available."
Controls Swept Away
"The ship took a sharp lurch and
the rudder control wires of the up
per rudder were carried away. I
unclutehed the upper rudder and
tried to steer with the lower rudder.
"The elevator man reported the
ship was falling rapidly.
