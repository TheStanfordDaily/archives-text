# P.-T.A. Group Concludes Child Welfare Discussion
## 
### 
In closing the convention of the
Sixth District California Congress
of Parents and Teachers, which met
on the campus for the last two days,
three major problems were dis
cussed. They were: proper use of
leisure time, prevention of delin
quency, and co-ordination of child
welfare work in general.
George H. WhLsler, probation of
ficer of San Francisco, in his speech
on "Probation in a Big City," at
tacked these problems directly. He
advocated teacher-aid in solving
juvenile problems, praised the work
of the churches of "problem chil
dren" until they were as old as 17.
Playground Director of San Fran
cisco Schools Randall spoke on the
value of recreation. To her mind,
"recreation" can well be added to
the familiar three R's as essentials
of education.
