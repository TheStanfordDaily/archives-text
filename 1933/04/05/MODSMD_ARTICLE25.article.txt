# Beer Ads, Now Banned, Are "Just Around the Corner"
##

ll was not surprising, the announcement lhal campus
publications would not be permitted to carry beer adver
tisements, only vaguely disappointing. Such a ban on ads
which might cxtoll (he purity and oilier superiorities of a
brewer's product or the convenience and hospitality of a
beer dispenser's establishment was rather to be expected
al Stanford, which, after all, is merely one of the great
American universities. These American universities rank
very low in any lisl of reactionary institutions. They spe
cialize in Life as il has been lived, generally speaking,
never living or leaching life as' il is lived in the robust
present.
The "no beer ads" decision was disappointing, there
fore, to some Stanford men and women who had hoped to
see their University step definitely forward from the ranks
of collegiate puritanism, a term used to indicate a tenacity
for the ways and standards of the past. The ban came as
an even greater disappointment to the business managers
of the local publications, who had visions of the new ad
vertising Source saving them from the reality of a year
in the red.
There was a lime, tradition chuckles, when the Stanford
administration was opposed to coca-cola advertising in the
Daii.y. Cigarettes were also frowned upon al one time, as
they slill are by several universities. Now beer, which is
to be advertised via the radio in almost every living domi
cile 011 the campus, gets the ollicial thumbs-down.
Hut beer advertising in the Daii.y is "just around the
corner." That is, it w ill come eventually. Along about 10lf)
American universities will catch up with the hoary tra
ditions of everyday life inaugurated in 1933, and then
there will be beer ads in campus publications. Still having
faith in the "youth" and "progressiveness" of Stanford,
the Daily will venture lo predict beer advertising in its
columns bv as earlv as, saw I'.MO.
