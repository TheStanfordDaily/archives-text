# Return of Legal Beer Only Partial Step Toward Ultimate Goal
## 
### 
The present beer hullabaloo is furnishing a refreshing
interlude in these days of depression, inflation, and mora
toriums. The last week or two have been made richer by
the revived interest in legalized beer. Conversation has
become lighter, more sparkling; dinner-table talk has been
enriched by reminiscences of the past days soon to return.
Hut in this discussion and general turmoil about the
return of the suds, the prime motive of the nation's liberals
must not be lost sight of. Free lunches and five-cent steins
will effect a great change (whether or not they are sold
within a mile and a half of the campus), but there is a
further goal to reach.
Absolute repeal is still the end to which that part of the
electorate not bound by the ties of the past is directed. It
is needless to restate their arguments against the most fa
mous amendment.
Wets must not regard the present victory as complete.
To some the idea has occurred that the surprisingly easy
triumph of legal beer advocates was due to a strategic
retreat of prohibitionists. A sop thrown to the wets a sop
soaked in suds is not a gratifying victory.
Pleasant is the return, in two days, of legal beer. Hdt
il is only a partial triumph; the main goal is yet to be
reached.
