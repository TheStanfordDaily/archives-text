# BULL SESSION

### ABE MELLINKOFF 
With a Grecian simplicity and a'
Mussolini-like certainty, it has been
decreed that campus publications
cannot accept beer advertisements.
While the pleasure of reading beer !
ads in vicarious to the extreme, the
Administration is taking no chances
at imaginative students becoming
intoxicated through the medium of
the Daily. They can read beer ads
in the San Francisco papers — but
come what may, the University will
not place its sanction on students
who wish to hit the horrible slide
that ends in hell and a stein of beer.
We are being protected from the ;
subtle evils of 3.2 per cent beer and
the wily machinations of the beer
barons. They will soon be telling us |
how to Keep Kissable and Thin—or
how to Lose Dandruff and Keep Our
Hair with their beer. The Univer
sity, while no doubt realizing that
every periodical will run beer ads,
will play the blue-nosed guardian ,
angel to the limit of their authority.
To be sure that we students are i
spared the enticing glories of beer,
censors should be appointed to read
everything that comes on the cam
pus and clip all references to beer.
The legal dryness of our fair Farm
must remain unsullied—either by
stein or through the printed page.
But perhaps the University is not
playing the guardian spirit in this
question of 3.2 per cent spirits. It
may be they are afraid that beer ads

WHAT! NO BEER AI)S?

i in the Stanford Daily would appear
as an endorsement of beer by the
University. And that would surely
be a horrible indictment of our col
! lege. Imagine the utter depravity of
! it all.
Yet the University surely does not
hold itself as an endorser of every
; thing that buys space in campus
publications. There are cigarettes.
And especially, advertisements
showing WOMEN smoking in pub
lic. That is not only frowned upon
but is supposed to be taboo. Weak
beer is surely no more injurious or
immoraKthan cigarettes.
And how about ginger-ale ads? It
I is common knowledge that this bev
erage is used to kill the uncivilized
taste of raw gin in that institution
termed the high-ball. All ginger ale
used for any other purpose on the
campus could be laid end to end in
!a thimble—a small thimble. So well
is this known that even the Union
has extra supplies of the stuff (gin
i ger ale, not cocktails) on ice after
every big football game.
Surely the Administration does
not officially or even unofficially
sanction high-balls. Then why this
manifesto about beer ads? With all
three campus publications emersed
or about to be emersed in red, the
haze of hope on the horizon has
lifted, showing a large Administra
tive thumb prudishly pointing earth
ward.
