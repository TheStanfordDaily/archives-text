The Editor, Sir:
It is perhaps too much to hope
that any newspaper should ever get
any piece of news really right, but
when a paper prints anything as
completely absurd as the Daily's |
write-up of the Conference Against;
War, held at Stanford last week-end,
a protest seems justified. The Con
ference never even officially con
sidered the resolution which the!
Daily s.tates was adopted. The very ,
first sentence of the write-up leaves
no doubt of the fact that the re- i
porter was completely lacking in
any knowledge of the spirit, atti- 1
tude, or action of the Conference. In
contrast with the attitude of the
Daily it might be interesting to
know that three members of the j
staff of the Daily Californian were !
in attendance at the whole Confer- ;
ence, and that a reporter for the '
Palo Alto Times covered all Con
ference meetings.
With the exception of the writer,!
the students interviewed in regard
to the Conference were students
who had shown not the slightest in
terest in the Conference, and whose
knowledge of it and of the subjects
discussed is quite as limited as that j
of the reporter. To those of us who
are devoting thought and effort to
ward working against war, it mat- j
ters not the slightest what Mr. Red- !
head or Miss Morris think of our
attempts; and it is quite inconceiv
able that the student body can have
any real interest in the opinions of
these' two students in regard to a j
subject of which they know nothing.
I recognize that the criticism is not
to be directed against the students,
but against the Daily and its re
porter.
In spite of the fact that the Con
ference adopted eight resolutions, j

each one of some importance, the
Daily mentions only two, one of
which was never considered for
adoption and the other of which
was rejected by an overwhelming
vote of the Conference. The reso
lution of greatest importance which
WAS adopted by the Conference
reads as follows: "Resolved: That
this group, believing that it is un
necessary and absurd to settle politi
cal or economic disputes between
nations by violence, will refuse to
be conscripted into any war what
soever."
If it is unreasonable to expect the
Daily to take any actual interest in
any student activities of a more
serious nature than athletics, cam
pus politics, and dances, may I sug
gest that that paper either ignore
such activities completely, or take
steps to find out the relevant facts
from students concerned?
Sincerely, Selden L. Osborne
