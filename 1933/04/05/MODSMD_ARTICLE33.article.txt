COUNSELLOR-AT-LAW (Rice)—
At the Alca/ar Theatre.
Elmer Rice's play, now in its
fourth and final week at the Alca
zar, affords a fine evening in the
theatre. Built about a central figure,
excellently played by Otto Kruger,
the cast includes a host of character
players, nearly all of whom play
well. Minor faults may be regarded
as more the fault of the director
than of the players.
"Counsellor-at-Law," concerning
the crisis in the career of successful
Lawyer George Simon, is a curious
ly written play. It defies flagrantly
and .successfully several of the most
generally accepted rules of dramatic
theory.
For two full acts the play xises to
what approaches tragedy and then
breaks into a farce scene which
swiftly turns into melodrama, end
ing the play happily but intensely.
And yet there is nothing absurd or
disturbing about this peculiar
change. The farce scene, coming as
it does when the tragedy has
reached its catastrophe, is momen
tarily shocking but the change into
melodrama through this scene (the
interview between Lawyer Simon
and soft-shoed MacFadden) is easy
and almost unnoticeable.
The first scene of the play—and
most of the second—is all but .plot
less; but Rice, during this time,
builds character and atmosphere so
skilfully that interest has no chance
to lag. There is a tendency toward

vaudeville humor, particularly in the
scenes in the outer office. This gag
ging and the melodramatic ending
confine the play largely to the timely
but does not obscure the universality
of the central situation—the threat
ened breaking of a tine character.
Otto Kruger is exceptional in the
central role. His pantomime is un
usually fine, studied and yet always
seeming spontaneous. To single out
other players for particular com
mendation is futile since it would
entail a listing of almost the entire
cast. It may be sufficient to say that
the production is eminently worth
seeing as one of the outstanding ones
in this and several preceding sea
sons. —Sandoe
