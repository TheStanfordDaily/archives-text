Amateurs Pray
for a Back Seat

Late in a calm, California eve
ning, a group of famous Stanford
students and ex-students are seated
around a long table at an exclusive
Los Angeles hotel. It is the annual
Southern California alumni banquet,
and the privileged guests of that
banquet are several members of the
Stanford Rugby Club.
Ilarlow Itothert is presiding at
the long table, and he has just
railed upon Tiny Thornhill and
Krnic Nevers to speak upon the
football situation on the Farm.
There is applause after the talks,
and then Harry Muloncy is asked
to discuss rugby.
To an audience that is first in- !
forested, then enthusiastic, and final
ly spontaneously carried away, Ma
loney tells the Horatio Alger story
of a group of Stanford men who be
gan to play a new-old game named
"rugby" merely out of curiosity and
ended by becoming so enamored
with the pure enjoyment of the !
.'port that they formed a rugby team.
It was the best rugby team in the j
entile state of California, and when
spring vacation rolled around, that
group of men (big men and little
men, football men and soccer men)
traveled down to Los Angeles in,
iher iown cars to play the Hollywood i ;
All-Stars for the rugby champion
f hip of the state.
You know the end of the tale.
Stanford won the game, 25 to 0,
but that is unimportant. What is
important is that trip by men who j
liked to play a game, by men who j
•lid not know that they would re
ceive a cent of expense money,
l>.V men who arc not certain that
two persons would show yp to
watch them play.
When Maloney finishes his story,
there is applause. Applause and 1
questioning. Questions from Bill J
Pi mberton and E. B. Hall, from Jim '
Reynolds and Fat Rheam, from Riek *
and Mutt Templeton. Questions from
these alumni, elderly men now, but '
;ill of whom have played rugby at c
college and all of whom are en
thusiastic about the group of Stan- '
ford men who were playing rugby p
merely for the pleasure. 1 <■
And tliere is no selfishness in •'
those questions. Thornhill and '
Nevers agree that rugby helps (
football players to handle the hall <
and to kick. And they realize that \
rugby, played only during the f
winter quarter, does not interfere
with football. 1
They realize also whnt rugby r
means to the players. It means the c
opportunity to play a game and to I
play it without pressure. To come t
out for practice when they wished, s
to run and tackle and kick because t
il is fun to run and tackle and kick,
to play informally, to play merely (
for sport's sake. j 1
There is hut one thing that the I
rugby players at Stanford desire. £
That is to be let alone. They don't
wish their sport to become pub- e
lici/.ed, to become formal, to lose i
its spontaneity. They know that I
rugby is not an economic burden f
on anyone (the game netted over c
40ft dollars for the Student Relief r
Fund) and they only wish to turn v
out next winter quarter and to
play the rugby game (already
scheduled) with California on
Washington's Birthday.
The theory of amateur sports
working in an atmosphere of "over-

emphasis on football''—that is what
rugby at Stanford represents.
Dressed in cut-off football pants and
frazzled sweat-shirts, shod with dis
carded football shoes, the Stanford
ruggers want rugbv for rugby's sake,
without pressure of formality.
The question, asked in prayerful
voice bya giant of the football team
of Harry Maloney, is not hard to
answer. It is simply: "llow can we
prevent rugby from becoming or
ganized?" —Dick Strouse
