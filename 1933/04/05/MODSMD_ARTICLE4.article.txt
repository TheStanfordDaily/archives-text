## Hold Tryouts Today For "Duchess Of Malfi" 
### James Sandoe 
In view of the Executive Council's
move to cut one play from the spring
quarter production schedule and to
fulfill a campus demand for some
sort of dramatic activity, Sword and
Sandals, men's honorary dramatic
organization, has projected a series
of four readings for the quarter.
"The Duchess of Malfi," one of the
finest of Elizabethan tragedies, is to
be the first of the series. The other
plays are being selected from a list
of seventeenth and eighteenth cen
tury comedies, among them Richard
Brinsley Sheridan's "The Critic; or,
a Tragedy Rehears'd," Congreve's
"Double Dealer," Steele's "Tender
Husband," and other, more modern,
plays.
To allow general participation in
the activity and to facilitate casting,
general tryouts will be held. Tryouts
for the first reading, to be presented
next week, will be held this after
noon at 1 o'clock in the Little
Theatre.
The cast for "The Duchess of
Malfi" is rather large. It includes
three women, the Duchess, her con
fidante Cariola, and Juliana, cuck
olding wife of an aging courier. Male
roles are considerably more varied:
Antonio, husband of the Duchess;
Bosola, a spying malcontent; Fer
dinand and the Cardinal, scheming
brothers of the Duchess; Delio,
friend of Antonio; and several cour
tiers.
The play concerns the Duchess'
love for Antonio, the efforts of her
brothers to gain her lands by pre
venting her marriage, and its dis
covery by Bosola, employed as a spy
by the brothers.
The series of readings has been
designed less for popularity, per
haps, than substance. It is the inten
tion of the organization to revive
some of the finer plays of the past
which live on despite a general
neglect of them. The last play of
