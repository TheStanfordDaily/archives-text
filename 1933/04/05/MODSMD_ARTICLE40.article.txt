# Stanford-Cal Ballmen Clash
## 
### 
Swinging into action for the first
time in over three weeks, Stanford's
frosh ball nine battles the California
yearling outfit at 2:30 o'clock this
afternoon on Berkeley diamond.
The engagement is the first of a
three-game series with the Bear
cubs.
So far this season the Indian
babes have been quite successful,
winning the great majority of their
contests and looking quite impres
sive at times. Nothing definite is
known of the Californians' strength
other than that they will be out
fighting hard as they always do
when participating against a Stan
ford team.
Coach Cuddeback plans to revise
his lineup somewhat, for the engage
ment. Morgan will probably hold
down his regular backstop position,
but Monk Moscrip, revamped from
the outfield, will undoubtedly see
service as a chucker in the event
that Blanchard weakens,
Comprising the infield will be
Grayson, Galbraith, Barnett, and
Tremaine, with Pope, Hamilton, and
Ed Clarke performing in the outer
gardens.
