## 
### 
With both teams handicapped by
the field and mounts available,
Stanford's polo four had little trou
i ble in rolling up ten goals to one
I for Loyola in a one-sided game with
the Lions last Saturday in Los An
geles.
A much closer and more interest
ing contest is expected next Satur
day when the two quartets meet on
the Stanford field for a return
match. Better horses and playing
conditions plus a probable four-goal
handicap in favor of Loyola will help
to even things up.
