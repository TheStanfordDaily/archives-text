# 2 S.C. Track Duels Listed
## 
### 
The Stanford track schedule,
which has seen considerable batter
ing at the hands of graduate man
: agers, has been revised to include
two meets with U.S.C., and now ap
pears to be in its final form.
The managers, always with an eye
to gathering in the shekels, have
arranged to bring the Trojans here
to meet Stanford April 22. The fol
lowing Saturday, the situation will
be reversed with U.S.C. playing host
to the Cardinals in the Southland.
Meanwhile, Les llahles, who has
been in tip-top shape for the past
two weeks, is reeling oIT times
consistently better than ten fiat in
the hundred. Ilables eased up in
yesterday's practice and allowed
Jimmy Willson to edge him out in
ten fiat time.
Dink Templeton's quest for more
power in the mile led him to try
Joe Burris in that event. Burris is
an accomplished performer in the
quarter and half, and would make a
capable miler with more experience.
He dropped a slow mile to the flashy
freshman Nimmo yesterday.
With Burris gone from the pack
of half-milers, Dan Murphy turned
in a respectable 1:59.6 for that dis
tance yesterday.
The reappearance of Dave Brown,
who does better than 190 feet with
the javelin, and the addition of Gor
don Dunn, will add point winners
in the field events.
Dunn is a weight man who has
come up the long trail from Fresno
via Menlo J.C. to enter Stanford
this quarter. He has passed 50 feet
