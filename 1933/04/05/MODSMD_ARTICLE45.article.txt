## 
### 
Inaugurating the 1933 Big Series,
Stanfoid and California ball players
tangle at 3:15 o'clock thi.s afternoon
in the game that may place the
Indians in the top niche of the
league standings.
California, at present leading the
league, stands as favorite to cop the
series. Combining a hard-hitting ag
gregation with one of the strongest
pitching staffs on the coast, the Bears
have yet to meet defeat while Stan
ford has lost one game to both St. >
Marys and U.S.C.
The Indians have played erratic
baseball most of the season but have
shown championship form at times
which gave promise of a pennant I
winner which may force the Bears
down in the league standings.
Big Fred Heringer, who pitched a
fine game against U.S.C., will prob- ,
ably get the mound assignment, with
Captain Ike Livcrmorb behind the |
plate. Ladue, center field, who with
Delmas and Miles furnished most of i
the fireworks on the recent South- ;
ern trip, will top the batting order, j
followed by Delmas, short; Malla
tratt, first base; Miles, right field,
Livermore, catcher; Irsfeld, left field; |
Woolley, second; Trautman, third;
and Heringer.
Zeke Keough has been the out- j
standing California chucker to date ;
and will probably get the call with
Dan Johnson to catch him. Captain
1 George Wolfman at first base is the
■ only experienced man in the infield
but the outfield is composed entirely
of veterans.
The second game of the series is I
slated for the Sunken Diamond Sat
urday afternoon.
