# Edelen Elected Cagers' Captain By Bunn's Boys
## 
### 
An Irish nickname, a line
hawll-out average, and six feet
two inches of smooth-passing
versatility will lead Stanford's
basketball team next year.
Such was the decision of this
year's cagers when they elected
Hal Edelen 1933-34 varsity cap
tain at a dinner given for the
basketball lettermcn by Mr.
and Mrs. John Bunn. The
choice of Edelen to succeed
diminutive, hard-fighting Tom
Cordry assures Stanford of a
captain who can, if necessity
arises, play all five positions
himself, for Hal was Stanford's
most illustrious forward-guard
center during the past season.
Edelen and Keith Topping are
the members of last year's
squad returning.
