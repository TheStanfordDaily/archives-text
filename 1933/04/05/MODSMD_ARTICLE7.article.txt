# Niles Blames Akron Crash On Air Waves
## News Report Of Lightning As Cause Discredited 
### Dave Mellinkoff 
A dramatic story of the United
States Navy's $4,000,000, three-block
long dirigible Akron being tossed
and twisted by turbulent air cur
rents was told yesterday by Alfred
S. Niles, Stanford professor of aero
nautic engineering, as a possible ex
planation of what promises to be the
most expensive tragedy in aviation
history.
Said Niles: "A thunderstorm is
like a very choppy sea, and with a
long airship the wind may be trying
to blow one end in one direction, and
the other in an entirely different
one, subjecting the structure to se
vere bending."
He discounted news reports that
the destruction was caused by light
ning having struck the huge hulk,
for the reason that the Akron was
floated with non-inflammable helium
gas.
Ignorance of the structure stresses
caused by thunderstorms handi
capped the builders of the Akron.
Quoth Niles: "If we just knew how
violent the forces in a thunderstorm
were, we could design for them, but
this is a very difficult problem.
"Meteorology is not. a very old
science, and in the past its energies
have been devoted more to prob
lems, like the prediction of rainfall,
that are of interest to everyone than
tr> the structure of thunderstorms
that are of direct interest to only a
few aeronauts."
Reviewing the history of lighter
than-air craft construction, Profes
sor Niles stated that most countries
have dropped airship development
because of unfortunate experiences
and excessive costs of experiments.
"We should reconsider arguments
pro and con airship construction and
perhaps leave lightcr-than-air craft
for another generation to play with,
when more knowledge is available."
