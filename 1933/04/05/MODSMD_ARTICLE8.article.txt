"From Bulb to Bloom," a Dutch
film designed to interest the Ameri
can "flower lover" but not particu
larly the student, drew a large audi
ence, conspicuously non-Stanford in
complexion, to the Assembly Hall
last evening.
The most unusual phase of the
motion picture was a series of ex
posures taken at intervals of minutes
or hours over a period of days or
weeks which showed in slow motion
the flanging of the artichoke-like
tulip and narcissus buds into blos
soms. Photographs taken in a similar
manner also showed bulbs shooting
their roots down into water.
"From Bulb to Bloom" largely
concerned itself with the bulb in
dustry in Holland and showed each
step in the industry from the plant
ing of the bulbs to the harvesting.
In each process, the picture showed
that all but the most mechanical of
operations arc performed by hand.
Explanations and side remarks by
Mrs. Martha E. Phillips, an enthusi
astic gardener herself, enhanced the
value of the picture.
