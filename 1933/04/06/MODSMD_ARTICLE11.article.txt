### Dave Mellinkoff 
Telling how Adolf Hitler was
swept into office on a tide cf na-

tionalism, anti-communism, and
popular opposition to political stale
mate, Ralph H. Lutz, professor of
history and chairman of the direc
tors of the Hoover War Library, yes
terday declared that the little Nazi
Ls "the greatest German politician
since the Armistice."
Dr. Lutz briefly reviewed varied
phases of Hitler ism as follows:
REPARATIONS: "Hitler, and, in
fact, all other German leaders have
stated that Germany will never
again pay reparations to the allies.''
AUSTRIA: "Union of Germany
and Austria is a point in the Hitler
program. At the first favorable op
portunity he will attempt to bring
Austria into the Reich."
THE JEWS: "The attack is di
rected against Communists and So
cialists, and not the Jews. Present
treatment of Jewish Germans is the
result of nationalistic agitation dur
ing the previous period of pessimism
and despair."
STRENGTH: "The election of
March 5 gave Hitler control of 341
scats in the Reichstag and conse
quently a working majority. This
was the first decisive victory for the
nationalists since the War. The
leaders in the national uprising' will
remain in power for some time to
come."
That Hitler does not take a back
seat to the best of American poli
ticians was indicated by Lutz in a
survey of the swastika-stamped pro
gram.
The program includes: I—All citi
zens and workers must become Ger
mans. 2—Authority of leadership
must take the place of the parlia
mentary system. 3—Saving the
farmer means saving the German
nation. 4—The family is the bedrock
of the state. s—State morality is the
basis of public welfare.
