# Navy Orders Akron Probe
## Search Continues; U-Boat Drags Ocean Floor 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 5 (/Pi — \
searching inquiry into the destruc-
I tion of the U.S.S. Akron will be
opened next Monday at Lakehurst,
N.J., by a naval court of inquiry
headed by Rear Admiral W. W.
1 Phelps.
The court was ordered late today
i by Admiral William V. Pratt, chief
jof naval operations, after he and
; other high officials had heard an ac
count of the tragedy from the only
| three survivors.
Pratt, not yielding to the ap
! parently inevitable, sent out new
j orders tonight to keep up the
search until "there can be no
thread of hope."
Likewise he ordered the subma
rine rescue ship Falcon to start
dragging for wreckage. Pieces of the
i craft, he felt, might contain the vital
clue to the cause of the crash, upon
which the three survivors could shed
little light.
Upon their findings will hinge,
probably, the course to be followed
by Congressional investigations for
which plans were started today. The
i wave of sentiment for abolition of
lighter-than-air craft met a reaction
in some quarters. A few Congress
t men spoke up against "hysterical"
, conclusions.
