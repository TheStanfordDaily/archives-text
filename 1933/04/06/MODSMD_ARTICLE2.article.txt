# Ban Imports! Fear Competition!
## 
### 
Handed right to tTiem; no argu- !
ment about it. according to those in
charge of the King Contest.
Stanford women aren't going to j
have to worry themselves to death j
about "import" competition in the I
race for Masque Ball honors this 1
spring .... NO OFF-CAMPUS j
WOMEN will be permitted to run, 1
it was learned last night.
"There are only 500 of them,"
declared Ed Boyles, last year's ,
chairman. "In 1932 they squawked
when Helen Judd almost walked |
awa\ with the queenship for Mills
College. Sure .they'll squawk this
year, too ... so why give 'em i
the chance?"
So?
With the idea of giving the local j
girls every possible break, it has j
been decided that Stanford women
can fight it out among themselves 1
this year .... without the old ax
of foreign competition hanging over
head.
