# Macon Will Come To Sunnyvale Base
## 
### 
Sunnyvale Naval air station, the
$5,000,000 home of the Macon, larg
est dirigible afloat, will not be with
out a tenant as some have prophe
sied since the loss of the Akron in
the Atlantic.
Secretary of the Navy Swanson
announced that, inasmuch as the
Macon's chief work was to be ser
vice with the fleet, and the fleet
being in the Pacific, plans to send
the air giant out to the coast will
not be altered.
