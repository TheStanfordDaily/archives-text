I'.urrok's Xorii,— /Itis is the see and of a series of articles on- the recently
leased annual /'resident's h'eport fior the year 1931.-32.

Activities revealed by the report
iof the Food Research Institute,
i closed otherwise to minions of the
press, both metropolitan and cam
j pus, range from studies of interna
tional economic policy to the ' inter
mediary carbohydrate metabolism of
rats."
The Institute is primarily inter
ested in fostering research in the
scattered problems connected with
| the production, distribution, and
consumption of food. Students of
' graduate standing and special train
ing only arc admitted to this de
' partment, the work of which is made
: possible under a grant from the Car
negie Corporation of New York.
At present the Institute is making
| economic and statistical analyses of
j the world wheat situation, the agri
! cultural conditions and policy of the
United States, the various fats and
oils of vegetable and animal origin,
, the factors regulating the price of
j foodstuffs, and studies in the chem
istry of cereals.
Maintaining correspondents in

Paris, London, and Manila, the In
stitute, centered on the campus, is
headed by Director Carl L. Alsberg.
The wide variety of extra-academic
work engaged in by Alsberg during
the past year shows many unrelated
subjects united in his studies of
food.
After delivering an address before
the California Dairy Council at
Fresno, Alsberg traveled to Chicago
to attend the convention of the Na
tional Canners Association for the
purpose of consulting with the con
cerning the economic investigation
of the canned-food industries which
he is supervising. A trustee of the
Institute of Pacific Relations, Als
berg is serving as director of a pro
ject to co-ordinate the land-utiliza
tion studies of the Institute.
Alsberg, at the same time, was di
recting the doctoral research of two
graduate students of the Department
of Chemistry, one dealing with the
phosphoric acid in starch molecules
and the other with the physiological
role of rubber in the guayule plant.
