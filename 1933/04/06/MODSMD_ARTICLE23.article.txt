bur yesterday morning addressed an
all-University assembly.

Answers Question
Answering in part the question
presented by his topic, "Why Be
Educated?" he said: "Our great
problem is to conquer ourselves, to
use our intellects and not our emo
tions in making decisions. If you
are educated, there are no limits to
where you may go." But he added
that there is no one answer to his
question.
Expressing fear that during the
stress of present economic conditions
"we should lose faith in what the
University means," the President
asked for the present and future co
operation of the students in order
that "Stanford shall be one of tho
great universities of the world." He
expressed his own confidence in the
future growth of the University.
President Wilbur's good humor
Mas reflected in several anecdotes
heard during his experience in
Washington and in allusions to the
early days on the campus when
cords were absent and soap was
not.
