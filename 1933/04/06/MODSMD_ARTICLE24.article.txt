### 
SACRAMENTO, April 5 (;P)â€”lf
the Legislature adopts the recom
mendations of the Assembly Ways
and Means Committee, there will be
no $9,000 appropriation with which
to entertain the governors of other
j states when they hold their annual
| conference in California during the
| coming summer.
Governor Rolph invited the gov
ernors to come to California and
;lhey accepted. The Governor then
! looked about for money with which
to entertain his distinguished visi
j tors. A bill was introduced appro
priating $9,000.
"The State of California is un
doubtedly honored in having as its
guests the governors of the various
states," the Assembly Budget Bal
ancing Committee stated. "These
governors will visit Sacramento, San
Francisco, and Los Angeles, and
while we realize the distinction con
ferred upon us we feel that the
people of the state are not finan
cially able to appropriate any money
for this purpose at this time. We
therefore do not provide for it in
the amended bill."
