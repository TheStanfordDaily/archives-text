# Beer To Go On Sale At Menlo Park
## 18-Year-Old Age Limit Only Restriction 
### 
With legalized 3.2 per cent beer
but one day oil, Menlo Park mer
chants yesterday declared them
selves ready to disregard prohibitive
measures in the state penal code and
sell the amber suds when they are
okched one minute after midnight
tomorrow.
Menlo Police Chief Frank Love
late yesterday said his office would
take no action of any kind against
beer salesmen.
Unless he received state orders
he would characterize his position
os-"sitting on the fence."
Wide-open Sale
At a Tuesday night meeting of the
Menlo Park city council, George K.
Whitworth, city attorney, introduced
a skeleton ordinance that would
permit wide-open sale of 3.2 per
cent beer.
Only restriction made was the
limiting of sale to minors. Age
limit was set at 18 years.
Completion of the ordinance was
postponed until a later meeting. City
Attorney Whitworth said that state
action might nullify any moves taken
by the city.
Merchants Willing
Merchants expressed the view that
they were willing to "take a chance''
selling the beer. They argued that
beverages with alcoholic content
have been sold for years without
restriction and as 3.2 per cent beer
is considered non-intoxicating legal
prohibition seemed uncertain.
No city beer licenses will be is
sued. Menlo officials said. Mer
chants already having licenses to
operate soft drink parlors and simi
lar businesses will be allowed to sell
beer unless special state orders are
issued to halt the sales.
Dink Says Okeh
City Attorney Whitworth ex
plained that the initiative ordinance
giving state control of liquor sales,
passed at the November election,
does not become operative until the
18th Amendment is repealed.
Dink Templeton, Stanford track
coach, today gave his endorsement
to beer, saying in one of his
Chronicle articles that he believed
beer was beneficial to athletes.
