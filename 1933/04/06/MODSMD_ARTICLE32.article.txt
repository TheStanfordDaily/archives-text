# INDIAN VARSITY SMEARS BEARS IN 8-3 VICTOR
## Estes, Ladue Lead Farm Batmen To Win Over California Team CARD NINE BRILLIANT U.C., Championship-Bound, Stopped By Defeat 
### Dick Strouse 
Steered by Herrn Estes and pow
ered by Bill Ladue, Stanford's little
I baseball flivver successfully ob
-1 structed the way of the champion
ship-bound California steam-roller
i yesterday on the Sunken Diamond's
; smooth runway.
The dilapidated flivver, made lusty
by nine sturdy sons of Stanford who
j wore out their gloves, bats, and
; voices, fielding, hitting, and shout -
I ing as a good baseball team should,
j negotiated the runway eight times
ito only three revolutions for the
| steam-roller.
Wolter Slowballs
Backseat driving for the winning
| car was Harry Wolter, happy that
he had chosen sloballing, slim Estes
. to pilot the renovated vehicle. Estes,
! who let Cal down with seven hits,
I found the Cards' thirteen hits, four
I of them contributed by Ladue, more
I than enough to help him afflict the
first Conference defeat on the Bears.
And trying to shriek the steam -
] roller on to a win was Clint Evans,
: who danced and shouted unavail
' ingly as his three pitchcrs (if they
were pitchcrs) could not stop
Stanford. Zekc Kcough, ace of the
Bear staff, tried first and lasted
for less than four innings.
Saunders, with memories of the
two victories over Dan Johnson in
| their freshman year, could not throw
! memories, and Robinson, who fin
! ished, escaped with only one run
| against him because he pitched only
I one inning.
Fielding Good
j Making only two errors, Stanford
t fielded like the champions they may
: yet become. Outstanding was Gordic
Mallatratt's work around first base.
Wolter now has his ace, Fred Her
inger, as a possible pitcher in Sat
urday's California game, and Harry
| Stark, Lefty Campbell, Stan Ander
! son, or even Estes again arc all in
| better shape than the California
! pitchers.
