# Will 74 Lost Lives Make the Airship Too Expensive?
## 
### 
The navv's greatest gesture of militaristic egoism and
waste lias cost a bunkoed American public the loss of 71
lives and over #;">,(>OO,(MM). And still the gold-braided admi
rals in Washington insist that they have not lost faith in
the airship.
And this faith will almost certainly move the mountain
of public hostility which will momentarily rise against
these $:">,( 100,000 death-traps. The "Shenandoah" tragedy
was soon forgotten.
Practically every high naval authority approached
since the "Akron" disaster has reiterated the idea that the
accident fails to prove the airship impracticable. Their
own investigation into the affair will undoubtedly be a
complete whitewash. Fortunately a righteously indignant
Congress is insisting upon a second investigation free from
navv prejudice. Perhaps this will show the man-killing
monster in its true light.
Even in the face of such a disaster it will be almost
impossible to convince the American public that the air
ship cannot be worth the toll of lives and dollars it de
mands. The spirit of jingo patriotism and pride so ably
instilled bv military and service groups is difficult to
combat.
The various back-slapping luncheon clubs and cham
bers of commerce have had a hand in this, too. Their
"Americanism" is based on having the biggest and best at
any cost. Civic bodies of this district will show the most
interest what are 71 lives to them when the stationing of
the "Macon" at Sunnyvale will create a large increase in
business ?
