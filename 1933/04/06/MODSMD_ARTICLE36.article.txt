Twelve and one-third seniors for every job. All I lie old
committeemen and committeewomen, and several new
ones, read their names in yesterday's list of MS seniors
appointed to the 12 major committee tasks of (lie Class
of It would have laken a long, systematic search yes
terday to discover a single one of the lucky 1 18 who was
experiencing any sensation remotely resembling a thrill at
