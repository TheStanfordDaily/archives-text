## 
### 
Developments in Menlo regard in <4 their new beer sales
ordinance, drafted Tuesday night, should he interesting to
the section of the student body which is awaiting 12: 01
o'clock tomorrow night to welcome legalized beer.
In discussing the ordinance allowing wide-open sales,
the Menlo Park City Council chose to ignore the provision
of the state penal code, placing a ban 011 sale of intoxicat
ing liquors within a mile and a half of the campus. Pro
ponents of the measure disregarded the city attorney's
warning of illegality, arguing that beer is now legally non
intoxicating, and that anyway tliev need the money.
II seems likely that Ibis new ordinance will be chal
lenged by prohibitionists residing near Menlo. The lest,
if il comes, will be valuable in determining future action
involving beer 'and a campus, and in crystallizing public
opinion on the legal restrictions.
Menlo Park h;is proved itself to be an enlightened com
munity, one which chooses to move with the times rather
than ally itself with local friends of the past.
Menlo Park may yet regain the affectionate regard in
which it was held by Stanford students before 1918. when
they thumped the table with their steins and sang, "Oh,
here's the road to Menlo, as plain as plain can be."
