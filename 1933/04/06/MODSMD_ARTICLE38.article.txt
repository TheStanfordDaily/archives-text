# BULL SESSION
## ALAS, POOR MARCONI 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
Tuning in on the radio during the I
evening, one might get the impres
sion that the programs were mildly
diverting even if slightly moronic.
Eut during the daytime, the pro
grams approach plain idiocy and
couldn't entertain anything 4hat
even listened to radio programs in
the evening. The depression has
lowered the standard; even though
that seemed impossible.
During a vacation, I receive pleas
ure and relaxation by playing chess;
and while the other fellow is figur
ing out a move, I listen to the radio.
When he has me puzzling, he listens.
The game never drags. The whole
system depends, however, on the
radio. Needless to say, the system
fails.
The big thing in radio broadcast
ing at the present is so-called
"Mountain Music." This is especially
popular in Los Angeles, due no
doubt to the great lowan populace
because we learn that "Mountain
Music" is simply an alliterative way
of stating—back-woods music. Thy I
advantage of this type is that the
songs never end—at least I have !
never heard one end. The singer
drones on and on—no variation and
no breaks. This gives the announcer
a chance to finish his contract hand
with the electricians.
An expert informed me that, given
a ukulele and turned loose in the

| Kentucky hills for five years, it is
Mountain Music that I would pro
i duce. But I wouldn't ask anyone to
listen to me. And after we have
other instruments besides the uku
lele and we are not roaming wild in
the Kentucky Hills. Yet I once dis
covered no less than six stations
playing this stuff simultaneously.
Of course, there is advertising. I
have become immune to being in
formed that the Old Faithful Baking
Powder Quarter will now sing bla,
bla. Let that pass along with the
announcement that this program is
being sponsored by the Never Yet
Tire Co. But when every record is
followed by a detailed analysis of
how to m;jke Blacked-Eyed Susan
| Cookies with Twin Six Chocolate,
I it's too much. The name of an auto
mobile after a recording may be ac
ceptable. A discussion of that car's
62 improvements is revolting. After
all, my mother didn't raise her son
to be an automobile mechanic.
Radio companies are not public
I educational institutions. They have
to make ends meet just like the
butcher and the baker—Edison hav
ing displaced the candle-stick maker.
It devolves upon city governments
to install municipal stations. They
are as necessary as public libraries
or schools. These stations can divide
their 24 hours equally between jazz,
semi-classical, and classical music to
' give all taxpayers a break.
