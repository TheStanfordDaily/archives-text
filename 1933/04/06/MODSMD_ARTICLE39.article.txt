CAPONSACCHI (Palmer-Goodrich)
—At the Columbia Theatre.
In this play, written in the roman
tic tradition and played in the same
manner, Browning's famous story of
Pompilia and her rescuer is brought
to tremulous life. Mr. Walter Hamp
den's suave manner and soothing
voice, his handsome person and per
suasive gesture, recalled much of
the best days of the Kembles, Keans,
Booths, and Irving.
The cast and the play are of equal
merit. The cadence of the verse, the
arrangement of scenes, appeared to
come from browning's own period,
and the vitality of the action had in
it much of the stem tracery of
Gothic architecture. The role of
Guido was played by Emest Rowan
whose rhythmic reading captivated
many of the audience in the pro
logue; the musical quality of the
reading rang through the theatre
with no effect of reveille.
The sets and costuming are such
as are seldom seen on the stage in
San Francisco; in subdued coloring
and treatment of masses, the reli
gious dignity of Pre-Raphaelite

painting was faithfully observed. j
The acoustics were also good; six j
curtain calls and a speech rewarded
the efforts of the audience. "Alice in j
Wonderland" will follow next week, j

FORTY-SECOND STREET (War
ners) —At the Peninsula Theatre
(Burlingamc) and the San Mateo
Theatre.
This film is fresh and amusing de
spite the fact that in plot it is no >
more than a slight variation upon
the aged backstage theme of chorus
! girl made star. Its staging is in
-1 genious, its choruses dance well, its
i gags are many and funny.
j There are four good tunes in the
I picture and none of them is over- |
used. The cast is full of familiar j
names, but the picture's star is Ruby j
Koeler, new to pictures, who plays
the wide-eyed chorine well.
The plot will not stand analysis,
but it serves its purpose—as frame
work for a series of songs, dances,
and gags—well enough. Coming as
lit does, after a long avoidance of
such films, the film is refreshing en
tertainment. —Sandoe
