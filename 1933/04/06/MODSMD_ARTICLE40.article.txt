A bank note which before the !
World War would have represented
considerably more than $2,000,000,- ,
000,000 in United States money forms
an interesting part of the exhibition
showing the post-war inflation of
German and Russian currency now ;
on display by the Hoover War Li
brary.
The piece of currency, of 10 tril
lion mark denomination, was issued
by the German government Novem
ber 1, 1923, and was worth $6,666 '
at that time. On the following day
its value had declined to $31. One ;
week later it was worth only $24. '
On the morning of November 20 the
bill had declined to $3.96 and by
evening of the same day was worth
$2.38 in United States exchange.
The present Hoover War Library
exhibit traces in chronological order
the inflation periods of both Ger- j

' many and Russia. Currency of the
; imperial provisional, army occupa
tional, Bolshevist, and Soviet gov
ernments is included in the Russian
display.
As a result of the inflation, the ex
hibition points out, that in May
; 1923 a 1,000-mark note was neces
i sary to purchase a single quart of !
milk. In June a cFozen eggs was ;
valued at 10,000 marks, and by Au
gust 50,000 paper marks were not
. sufficient to buy a loaf of bread.
Municipal scrip, issued by various
German cities during the hectic in
! flation period of 1923-24, is also on j
' display, along with a collection of
porcelain coins of the same period.
