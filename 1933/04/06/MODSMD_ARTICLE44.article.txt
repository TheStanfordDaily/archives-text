# Stanford Netmen Defeat Pomona College, 6 To 1
## 
### 
Varsity netmen added another vic
tory to their growing list, which in
cludes only one defeat at the hands
of U.S.C., when they beat Pomona
yesterday, six matches to one.
Joseph Coughlin, left-handed
Card captain, again broke into the
winning column by defeating Al
man, the Pomona No. 1 man, in a
three-set match. In the first set,
Coughlin didn't seem to find his
stroking, but after that the Pomona
player was no serious opposition to
Coughlin's clean placements. The
scores were 1-6, 6-2, 6-3.
The results of the remaining
matches were as follows: Otis de
feated Gerard, 6-1, 6-4; Blethen de
feated Higman, 6-0. 6-2; Mulone de
feated Forney, 6-2, 7-5 to gain Po
mona's only victory; and Butler
over Hager by scores of 6-0, 6-0. In
the doubles, a new combination,
Coughlin-Butler, beat Alman-Hig
man, 6-1, 6-1; while Otis and Ellis
won over Gerard-Malone, 6-0, 6-0.
