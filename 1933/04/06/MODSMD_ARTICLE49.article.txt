# Farm Agitated By Rumor Of Death Of Roosevelt
## 
### 
From the Row to Encina, the Farm
buzzed last night with the persistent
rumor that President Franklin D.
Roosevelt had been assassinated.
Vague though the reports were, they
continued in circulation from the
! dinner hour until about 10 o'clock,
and centered in Encina Hall.
It is alleged that the rumor started
when freshmen broadcasted the
news over a microphone attached to
a radio in Encina.
