## Something New on the Grand Old Man 
### 
There has been much prattle in
the sport pages of this part of the
country recently concerning the life,
ambitions, and vigor of Amos Alonzo
Stagg—the oldest kid in the United
States—and although much of the 1
prattle is ,like all sports "news," the
relieved expressions of hack writers
who are uplifted to new efforts at j
imposing verbosity by having some- '
thing new to write about, much of
it is also true.
Among the uncxploited charac
teristics of the Grand Old Man
from Chicago who is now merely
the'new coach at College of the
Pacific are tennis-playing wizardy, 1
religious zealotry, and occasional
tyranny on the football field.
Among Stagg's accomplishments i
also are two sons. One of them is a
stocky individual who is muscle
bound everywhere, including be
tween the ears. He is the assistant
track coach at the University of ;
Chicago. The other son, although i
not in a class with his brother, still!
fell so low in the scale of intelli- i
gei ice as to take my advice in high- !
school French. And since I was sev- j
oral times nearly requested to leave j
high school because of French, it is j
not difficult to place Paul.
Bui Paul (the second Stagg son)
was also the University of Chicago i
tennis captain, and one of the best j
players in the Big Ten. Paul used j
to play with his illustrious father, '
and in spite of the son's racket ex- j
cellence, the poor, doddering old j
man could win his share of games. J
Stagg has always been in condi
tion: he may need it if College of j
Pacific alumni are similar to other j
Coast school alumni.
Stagg's ideas on prohibition are i
also worthy of mention. He has been I
in favor of temperance for years, ]
and he believes in prohibition as the j
best means toward obtaining tem
perance. Some of you may have
heard of the anti-prohibition society
known as the Crusaders. Stagg, not
to be outdone, started and supported
an anti-anti-prohibition society ap
propriately named the Saracens. I
am not sure just what has become
of the Saracens since this man
Roosevelt.
When Chicago's teams were at
the height of their power, they
featured plunging fullbacks who
made the old Maroon song,
"Plunge, Plunge through the Line,"
something more than a refrain. ;
John Thomas and Five Yards Mc- j
Carthy were the most famous of I
them all, but there were others,
including Timme and Zorn. Chi
cago had a series with the famous
Princeton sadly sang: "Timme and
American Paul Scull) in those
days, and after the game back
Fast in which Chicago powered
her way through the Tigers,
Prniceton sadly sang: "Timnie and i
Thomas and Zorn. We wish they'd j
never been born."
My own personal relations with j
Stagg are somewhat clouded with
the awe of a Chicago kid for the
famous coach. I was playing mar
bles in the living-room of Doc Reed's
house with a younger Reed, when
Stagg strode in. He had come to see j
Doc Reed, who is the Dr. Storey of I
Chicago, upon some matter con
cerning the health of Chicago stu
dents, and when he sat down on the
couch to begin the discussion, he sat I
<-n my carefully chosen penny mar
bles.
I fled from the great mans pres- :
once, and when 1 reached the low
ly sanctity of my own home, I !
boasted: "Gee. Mother, do you !
know what? Mr. Stagg is sitting
on my marbles." —Dick Strousc j
