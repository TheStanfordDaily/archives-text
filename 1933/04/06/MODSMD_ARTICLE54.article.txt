# Little May Be Out Of Carnival Golfing Meet
## 
### 
That Lawson Little, Stanford's
star varsity golfer, might be lost to
the Cardinals in Friday's Minor
Sports Carnival matches with Cali
fornia, U.S.C., and U.C.L.A., was a
possibility today.
There has been a controversy over
grades and Lawson may be declared
ineligible. However, even with that
handicap, Eddie Twiggs, Stanford
golf coach, is in high spirits concern
ing the chances which a team led
by Harry Eichelberger will have of
grabbing off number one place.
Final team selections are not com
plete but Dick Giddings, Tom
Dwyer, Gene Brown, and Jack Geer
will all probably see some action in
the four-sided meet.
