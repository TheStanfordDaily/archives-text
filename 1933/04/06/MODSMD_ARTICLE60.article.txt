# Spring Gridiron Practice Starts Under Thornhill
## 
### FRANCIS HAMILTON 
Sixty men appeared in uniform
yesterday for the first session of
spring football on the Farm. The
, sixty expended much energy and
incurred sundry bruises, but the
outstanding man of the day was one
time Line Coach "Tiny" Thornhill,
now Head Coi.ch Thornhill, who ap
peared in his new role jovially
bawling instructions at a crew of
rusty-jointed linemen.
Down the field Ernie Nevers, big
I and tight-lipped, harrassed his er
ring backs with a stentorian voice,
while Jim Lawson's low tones ad-
I vised the set of ends.
j For all the squad's off-season rag
gedness, there was a glimpse of bet
ter times in store for Stanford's
football prestige. Chunky Frank
Alustiza, for instance, looked right
in his element at quarter. Remem
, ber how liquid smooth Frank Care
deo appeared when he backed up
to do his stuff in the football picture
"All-American"? Well, Alustiza was
a close approach to that smoothness.

And Ben Palamountain ought to
be ready. He's been hailed as one of
the best tackle prospects that ever
put cleat to turf in this vicinity, and
after starring at rugby for the past
two months, he is in the best of !
condition. Opposite him, the 220-
pound giant from the Grays, Wes
Muller, looks good.
A host of end candidates are in
quest of those positions vacated by
Todd, Doub, and Colvin. Keith Top
ping, of basketball note was a new
comer in this department, and A1
Norgard, a former varsity substitute,
was also on deck.
/Twenty-three more men are
signed up who did not report yes
terday. Moreover, a number of the
promising frosh are busy with other
spring sports and will not work out
until freshman schedules are con- i
eluded.
Jim Moscrip, Bob Hamilton, and
Bobby Grayson are all playing ;
freshman baseball, while Huntington J
Kingsbury, end, is stepping over the
hurdles with the '36 track squad.
