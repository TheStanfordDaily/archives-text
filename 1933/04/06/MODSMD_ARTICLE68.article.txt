# FOUR INDIANS IN MAT CONTESTS AT SPORTS CARNIVAL
## 
### 
Four Stanford wrestlers will com
pote against men from California and
U.C.L.A. in the Minor Sports Car
nival to be held at Berkeley Friday
in an attempt to win coast cham
pionships and also to. establish
wrestling as an intercollegiate sport.
This is the first time in eight years
that Stanford matmen will meet
their traditional rivals across the
bay and future engagements depend
a good deal upon the success of this
year's tournament.
Jake Butts, 155-pound entrant, is
probably the best Stanford prospect.
Jake has had plenty of experience
in the Middlewest where wrestling
is one of the major sports events.
Hugh Powers, who won the Uni
versity title in the 165-pound divi
sion, is competing in the 175 weight
in order to give his teammate, Len
Youdall, a chance in the 165 class.
Youdall won the 155-pound (itle in
the University tournament but
moved up one class when Butts en
tered competition.
The other member of Stanford's
four-man team is Dave Cooke, who
will enter the 145-pound division.
Cooke won the 145-pound title in
last quarter's tournament.
