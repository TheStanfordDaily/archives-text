# U.C. BUDGET CUTS ARE DECRIED BY SPROUL ON RADIO
## 
### 
Declaring that certain destruction
will result for the University of Cali
fornia if the proposed drastic budget
cuts proposed by the Ways and
Means committee of the California
Assembly are made, President Rob
ert Gordon Sproul appealed directly
to the people of California to pro
tect their state university last night
in a statewide radio broadcast.
President Sproul said that the
University of California has co
operated to the fullest in reducing
expenditures. Pointing out that when
Governor Rolph warned the regents
that a three million dollar budget
cut would be necessary the slash
was immediately made, the presi
dent declared that this cut was far
more drastic than the figures would
indicate because of the eight per
cent increased enrollment during
the last two years.
'"I believe that the proposals of
the Ways and Means committee of
the Assembly, as they pertain to the
university, will be destructive to the
very foundations of the institution,"
Sproul declared.
"Salaries are now less than in
other universities with which we
must compete for good men. To re
duce them further would be to court
losses in intellectual leadership
which would more than offset any
possible saving in money."
Concerning the work of the Col
lege of Agriculture, which expends
25 per cent of the state's appropria
tion, President Sproul said, "Entire
programs of investigation which have
profited the state by tens of millions
of dollars will be not temporarily
interrupted but completely wrecked.
The number of farm advisers and
home demonstration agents will be
cut in half. It will be a staggering
blow to California's basic industry."
