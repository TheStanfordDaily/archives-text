Pennant possibilities or .second
place oblivion face Coach Harry
Wolter's Stanford ball team when it
meets California's league-leading
Bears in the second game of their
series at 2:30 o'clock tomorrow after
noon on the Sunken Diamond.
IS 111 one game out of first place,
tin; Indians can go into a tie for
the league leadership by repeating
their victory of Wednesday, the
first defeat suffered hy California
this year. A defeat tomorrow will
mean that Stanford can only tie
for the pennant hy winning the
last game of the Bear series and
defeating U.S.C. in their final game
here in two weeks provided the
Trojans can upset California in
their remaining battle.
Stanford seems to have finally
donned its long-lost batting togs
which means plenty of hot water for
Clint Evans' mound staff from Ber
keley tomorrow. Wednesday the In
dians touched the combined offer
ings of Keough and Saunders for 13
hits and in the last U.S.C. game they
drove the ball to all corners of the
park foi" 17 safeties.
"Toodles" Ladue in center field
was the bit? power Wednesday, while
Bert Delmas, Dick Miles, and Cap
tain Livermore have driven in plen
ty of runs. Delmas in particular has
been having a .good year with two
perfect days at the plate to his
credit, one against the Trojans and
one against St. Mary's.
Mallatratt, Woolley, Trautman, and
Delmas will open the game in Stan
ford's infield, called the smoothest
combination in coast collegiate base
ball when it is working right. Irs
feld, Laduo, and Miles will take care
of the outfield.
Either Fred Hcringer or Harry
Starke will probably lie Wolter's
mound selection tomorrow and
will attempt to repeat Herm Estcs'
performance of Wednesday. Liver
more will again be behind the
plate.
Clint Evans will probably send
either Joe Gallison or Zeke Keough
to the box for California. Keough
is the ace of the Bear hurling staff
but was knocked off the hill in the
fourth inning of the first game by
the big Stanford bats.
The rest of the California lineup
will probably include Johnson,
catcher; Wolf man, Kline, Salisbury,
and Halliver around the infield, and
Jacobson, Kyle, and Mclntyre in
the outfield.

first defeat suffered hy California
this year. A defeat tomorrow will
mean that Stanford can only tie
for the pennant hy winning the
last game of the Bear series and
defeating U.S.C. in their final game
here in two weeks provided the
Trojans can upset California in
their remaining battle.
Stanford seems to have finally
donned its long-lost batting togs
which means plenty of hot water for
Clint Evans' mound staff from Ber
keley tomorrow. Wednesday the In
dians touched the combined offer
ings of Keough and Saunders for 13
hits and in the last U.S.C. game they
drove the ball to all corners of the
park foi" 17 safeties.
"Toodles" Ladue in center field
was the bit? power Wednesday, while
Bert Delmas, Dick Miles, and Cap
tain Livermore have driven in plen
ty of runs. Delmas in particular has
been having a .good year with two
perfect days at the plate to his
credit, one against the Trojans and
one against St. Mary's.
Mallatratt, Woolley, Trautman, and
Delmas will open the game in Stan
ford's infield, called the smoothest
combination in coast collegiate base
ball when it is working right. Irs
feld, Laduo, and Miles will take care
of the outfield.
Either Fred Hcringer or Harry
Starke will probably lie Wolter's
mound selection tomorrow and
will attempt to repeat Herm Estcs'
performance of Wednesday. Liver
more will again be behind the
plate.
Clint Evans will probably send
either Joe Gallison or Zeke Keough
to the box for California. Keough
is the ace of the Bear hurling staff
but was knocked off the hill in the
fourth inning of the first game by
the big Stanford bats.
The rest of the California lineup
will probably include Johnson,
catcher; Wolf man, Kline, Salisbury,
and Halliver around the infield, and
Jacobson, Kyle, and Mclntyre in
the outfield.
