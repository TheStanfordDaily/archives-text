# 38 Experienced Men In Spring Soccer Turnout
## 
### 
Eleven circle-lettermen, a full
soccer team from last year's soccer
varsity, comprise a part of the large
spring turn-out of 38 men for that
sport of stinging shins, winded play
ers, expert kicking, and head-to
head ball passing.
Spring practice has been post
poned until Monday afternoon owing
to tonight's Minor Sports contest.
However, uniforms were issued yes
terday to the 38 experienced men
from the 1932 varsity and freshman
teams.
Such a large turnout finds ten
good halfbacks out to fill the three
berths of those positions, this being
the strong point of next season's
team, judging by the number of ri
vals for the places. Only in the goalie
position is there a comparable show
of strength with two experienced
varsity men and one fine frosh goal j
guard competing for the post.
