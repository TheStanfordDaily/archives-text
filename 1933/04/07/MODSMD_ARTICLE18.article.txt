# 'No Beer For Athletes Say Stanford Mentors
## 
### 
J As* the citizens of 19 stales and
; the* District of Columbia take their
! first sip of legal 3.2 per cent beer
this morning the Stanford campus
sits, quietly, thirstily, by to watch
economic and physical changes
throughout the United States.
Stanford's physical education de
partment. seemed strongly united
against President Roosevelt's manna
| when interviewed last night. Partial
| quotes from five coaches and hygiene
J professors follow:
John Bonn, Varsity Basketball
I Coach:
"I'm a rabid prohibitionist through
I and through. I have always thought
| alcoholic liquors of any kind were
j injurious to man and I don't believe
j in them for training or any other
j purpose."
K. Heed Long, Professor of Hy
giene:
''I believe beer is injurious in itself
offering the possibility of

forming a strong habit. 1 have lived
through a period when beer was
sold and have found that it hinders
man's faculties. A little alcohol may
be good for the human body but is
very dangerous to use."
Harry Maloncy, Minor Sports Di
rector:
Whether a man drinks beer or not
is entirely an individual matter."
Harry Wolter, Varsity Baseball i
Coach:
"Alcohol in any form has no part
in athletics. Beer for the man is en
tirely a matter to be decided by the
individual. For the athlete beer or
any alcoholic beverage is out."
Elwyn Bugge, Fencing and Tennis '
Coach:
"I can't get very enthusiastic
about beer. I don't believe it will i
be as economically beneficial as
propagandists have said. Like any
other alcoholic drink, beer is in
jurious if taken in excess."
