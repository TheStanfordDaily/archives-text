# Change Can Never Stop, Says Wilbur
## University Plan Altered By Youth Contact 
### Rolph Malloch 
When the pilot himself throws the
monkey-wrench in the machinery,
that's news ....
Dr. Wilbur has "wrecked" Stan
ford innumerable times, if you
would believe his critics.
Change Inevitable
He said yesterday, "People have
I .said that I've "ruined" Stanford
| many times. Every time a change is
| made, someone thinks you've broken
i the place to pieces. Every change
j gives growing pains.
"But every university must al
ways be changing; the contact of
| young minds with old minds is the
j only constant; all else changes."
The President pointed out that
when he took his position as head
jof the University that the annual
budget was $700,000, compared to
I $2,300,000 now. This means there has
i been tremendous expansion, which
naturally brings change.
"There We (Jo"
Dr. Wilbur pointed out that the
i establishment of the business school,
[ the Ryan and other laboratories, the
} athletic plant, and other innovations
j brought protests and the reaction.
I "There we go." This is the normal
j reaction, he says. The students who
come here must accommodate them
selves to the University as they find
it; after they graduate they want
| Stanford to remain always as they
| know it. These graduates want to
! come back to the scenes of their
j fond memories and find everything
! unchanged.
As a result of the changes, the
i University has become nationally
known. "Few people have now
J not heard of Stanford University,"
I Dr. Wilbur said. "In former days,
, it was known as merely 'a place
Out West, organized by some rich
man and belonging to the Univcr-
I sity of California."
