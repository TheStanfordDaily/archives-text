Seeking team triumphs and indi
vidual glory, swimming, water polo,
fencing, wrestling, and gymnastic
representatives from California's Big
Four universities will gather here
and at Berkeley today and tomorrow
for the varied athletic events of tho
Fourth Annual Minor Sports Carni
val. Although most of the events
will take place at Berkeley, the
Stanford greens will be the scene of
all the golf matches.
Medal play to determine team
golf championships will begin at
!) o'clock this morning. The first
two rounds of individual play will
take place tomorrow morning and
afternoon, with the linal 36-holo
match scheduled for Monday
morning.
Fencers will cross foils at 10
o'clock this morning for their first
bouts, which will continue through
out the day, ending with epee con
tests this afternoon. Saber mutches
will be held at 10 o'clock tomorrow
morning. Stanford's fencing entrants
will be Captain Leonard Pockman,
John Ferguson, Al Snyder, Hubert
Chain, Ed Munger, and Gordon
Steedman.
Swimming Events
Swimming preliminaries will be
gin at 10 o'clock this morning with
finals scheduled for 2:30 o'clock. The
three water polo games will be held
at 10:30, 2:30, and 8 o'clock tomor
row evening.
The aquatic events will probably
find the Indians dominating the
field, as they have regidarly done
on the Pacific Coast for the past
18 years. Led by Ted Wiget, Cap
tain Fred Tebbetts, Gordy Graves,
and Bob Clark, with the able as
sistance of Vlad Taranik, Dick
Ilirsch, Jimmy Triolo, and others,
the swimming team is a near cinch
to capture the Pacific Coast crown
again this afternoon.
The most interesting feature of the
day's events is expected to be the
individual races and performances,
which will include the appearance
of Ted Wiget, Stanford's National
Intercollegiate 440- and 220-yard
champion. Another Stanford cham
pion who will compete is Bob Clark,
holder of the Pacific Coast Intercol
legiate breaststroke title, who will
meet Dean Lang worthy, California
star. Clark won from the Bear flash
by inches in the California dual
meet and today's race is expected
to be another nip-and-tuck affair.
Captain Fred Tebbetts will meet
Earl Plescia for the Coast backstroke
crown, won by the Trojan star in
last year's race. Gordy Graves and
Dick Hirsch will attempt to upset
things by defeating Bob Browne of
S.C. in the sprints. Rufus Rucker
of California is favored to win the
diving, with Holston of the Trojans
and Friedman of Stanford fighting
it out for second place.
Stanford's undefeated water polo
team is favored to win the cham
pionship, although Southern Cali
fornia, last year's overtime winner,
has another strong team. Coach
Nort Thornton will use the same
lineup that has carried the team
through its long string of victories.
Card Golfers Favored
Although the golf team had not
been definitely decided upon last
night, Stanford's six representatives
will probably be chosen from Law
son Little, Harry Eichelberger, Dick
Giddings, Jack Geer, Gene Brown,
Tom Dwyer, and Stuart Hawley.
Coach Twiggs concedes his team an
excellent chance to capture the
championship.
Gymnastic events are scheduled
for 7:30 o'clock tonight, while four
Stanford wrestlers will enter the
Carnival unofficially. The quartet of
torso twisters will be composed of
Jake Butts, Hugh Powers, Len You
dall, and Dave Cooke.
