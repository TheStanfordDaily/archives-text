## 
### 
Rising on all sides to protest
against the "patronizing" action
of the Rally Committee in de
claring that Stanford women
will not have to suffer ''im
port" competition in the Masque
Hall race this spring, members
of the "oOO" were unanimous
in demanding that this restric
tion he removed.
Eleanor Harris, Theta, stated
last night: "Stanford women
can hold their own with ANY
competition! We're not afraid
of any highly praised ofT-cain
pus womenâ€”in fact ,we chal
lenge them all!"
Sandy Leih, prominent Kap
pa, added: "Why make all the
stupid regulations? If we can't
win on our own merits, what
fun would there he in being
Queen?''
Virginia Ingram, Pi Phi, de
clared emphatically: "The Stan
ford women demand that they
be given an opportunity to
PROVE that they can beat
ANYONE in the coming race!
Bring on your prospective
Queens and watch us take care
of them."
