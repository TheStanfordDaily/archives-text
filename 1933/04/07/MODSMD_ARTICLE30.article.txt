# Mile-and-a-Half Law Becomes Antedated Today
## 
### 
Beer, amber and sparkling, '1.2 per cent alcoholic, and
all perfectly legal, foamed over the hrims of steins up and
down the state last night. Juhilant throngs, bottles on the
table for the first time since 1918, made a gala night of it
in San Francisco. Meanwhile that oft-caricatured indi
vidual, Mr. Average Man, whose ballot last fall had made
possible the city's festivities ,sa! at home by his radio well
pleased with it all.
Several Stanford students were seen among the crowds
;:l San Francisco's large hotels. They couldn't get a drink
of anything but bootleg beer at Stanford or in Palo Alto,
so nianv of them went to the city. Hut every Stanford
student who wanted a glass of beer last night got it, re
gardless of the mile-and-a-half rule, I'niversity adminis
trative policy, hell, or high water.
Hack at Harvard, the hub of what we Westerners are
prone to contemptuously designate "conservative New
Fngland," beer is being served in the university dining
rooms today. That fact constitutes no breach of conserva
tism either, for once again an unconventionalitv of yester
day has become the norm of today's behaviorism.
Why not beer at the Stanford Union? Principally be
cause the California penal code forbids alcoholic or vinous
liquors within a mile and a half of any university campus,
il seems. Hut under that same ruling, inconsistently
enough, near beer, containing a small percentage of alco
hol, is sold on every campus where there is a soda foun
tain.
That particular section of the California code becomes
antedated today, and it should go by the boards. It has
been a laughing stock for years anyway, with students at
Stanford, for example, being able to purchase bootleg gin
and whiskey on University property.
