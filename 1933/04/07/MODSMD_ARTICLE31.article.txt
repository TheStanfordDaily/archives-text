# Local Registration of Students as an Impetus to Political Interest
## 
### 
It is a strange fact that in this country, which is popu
larly supposed to be the most democratic in the world, the
university student group lias practically no influence in
politics.
In almost every European country which has a repub
lican form of government this group has come to be one
of Iht 1 strongest factions in national and local elections. In
Spain it is the strongest.
College men and women of the United States generally
regard politics either with amused contempt or complete
indifference. Very few show an active interest. The ex
planation of this attitude is not dillicult to find.
In the first place it is much easier to laugh off a cor
rupt and childish government than if is to make an attempt
to correct conditions. And ease is certainly the chief major
study of practically every student. A blase attitude is the
order of the day.
An unfortunate realization of futility is another bar to
interest. The incompetence of the voting population is all
too evident and the chance of combatting this majority
seems hopeless.
The greatest bar to student participation in politics,
however, is the impossibility of local registration. Were
this overcome there are many indications that active stu
dent interest in national and local government would
ensue.
