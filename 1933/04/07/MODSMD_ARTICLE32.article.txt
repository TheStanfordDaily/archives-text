# When Sawdust and Tinsel Make Their Visit to the Farm
## 
### 
Onec again il seems thai thai annual storm-cloud called
Ihe Masque Hall is settling down upon the campus, with
the usual fanfare of trumpets, sudden alarums by night,
and all the attendant backbiting and inside manipulations.
Undoubtedly fostered by a worthy motive, a cause that
is peculiarly Stanford's own, the Ball annually combines
charity and a form of entertainment. With all profits go
ing to the Convalescent Home on the banks of the San
Francisquito. il functions as a meritorious service to the
campus; indirectly, too, inasmuch as periodic campaigns
for funds are replaced by a painless method of extraction.
Unfortunately, however, the annual affair becomes al
most a visitation to the campus, due Jo the brand of bally
hoo thought necessary for success. Whether or not this
year's publicity drive will equal last year's in general
whoopla is not yet definitely known. II is to be hoped that
it will not, for while lasl year's hokum campaign was in
tensely and hilariously interesting to those participating
and to those booming candidates for the regal honors, the
majority of the campus seemed to look on with an air of
only mild curiosity.
It would seem possible to put across a Masque Hall
some year without the flavor of the combined Hollywood
and junior college spirits pervading the Farm. Appealing
as it does to two of the strongest human desires the love
of dressing-up and the urge for personal victory it should
be feasible to promote a dance of the Masque Hall type
without resorting to the cheaper grades of sawdust and
tinsel. It might be worth trying some year.
