# BULL SESSION
## THE 						JINKS THAT FAILED 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
While everyone on the campus ;
was discussing the financial and
artistic advisability of producing a
Hi-Jinks, their meditations were
brought to a peremptory finis by the
returning Administration. Late last
quarter, the President's Office de
creed that the Hi-Jinks would not
be. The order caught both propon
ents and opponents of the Hi-Jinks j
with their mouths open—in the mid
dle of bitter argument.
Their mouths closed—in astonish
ment. They soon opened again — j
some with a smile and others with j
a groan. But the matter has been
settled. Far be it from our purpose ,
to attempt to "educate" Dr. Wlibur
on the advisability of reinstating the
Hi-Jinks. In his lively yet instruc
tive address the other day, he ad- j
mitted the impossibility of such a '
procedure. What 25 editors couldn't '
do, one Bull Sessioner will not at
tempt. Don Quixote looked some
what foolish against the wind-mills.
He would probably look plain ridi- !
culous against a University Admin
istration. Both are equally invulner
able—especially the Administration.
To those who wrote scripts for the
show, I offer sympathy and condo
lences. That is all there is to offer [
you. You thought that once having ,
been approved, the Hi-Jinks would
be produced. So did I. We both
failed to consider acts of God, re
turning administrations, and other
unforeseeable and irresistable forces.
In a way, we have no one to
blame but ourselves for our ignor
ance. For in the Scriptures it is '

written that the sins of the fathers
shall be suffered by the children—
unto the foi irth generation. Previ
ous generati was of Stanford men
have produc td! naughty Hi-Jinks
and their p< jrnographic taint must
be borne by this generation—though
we be as pur ? as the undriven snow.
So it is writt i. So it must be.
The Preside ntial Edict, however,
really saved the Ex Committee an
embarrassing* situation. They were
torn between, their first promise and
the bevy of theatrical women who
stormed the ] neeting. Each dramatic
starina woult i strike an effective
pose and pou: • forth arguments. The
Ex Committa - didn't have to vote,
but I'll wage r that those effective
poses would '.have carried the day. !
I don't quite rt member all the argu
ments. The potency of the attitudes
struck will ever remain—a beautiful
and lasting tribute to the "500."
The Hi-Jinks .is dead and the
scripts can be usoo 1 for starting fir eg
next autumn quarter. But dramatics •
at Stanford should not be allowed
to squirm a little and breathe its :
last. The current play should be
supported if Stanford is to be more
than a place for football teams to
rest up between trips. "Hawk Is- (
land" is billed as a sophisticated
mystery.
No pretenses of great art or in
tellectuality are made for the play.
In short, it is made for box-office
appeal—for campus appeal. Person
ally, I like mysteries because it
shov/s to what lengths an author
will go to conceal the obvious from
his audience. <
