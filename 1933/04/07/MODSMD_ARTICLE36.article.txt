HAMLET—At the Columbia Theatre
Walter Hampden's Hamlet was a
youth, at first completely shattered
by the knowledge of his father's
murder and his mother's guilt, but,
i'S he advanced through the play,
acquired a philosophy, a poise, and
a determination similar to that of
'the stoic. His actions were decisive;
his delay in attaining revenge was
not due to any indecision but rather
to adverse circumstances which pre
vented him from obtaining complete
satisfaction until the last scene.
The first scene between Hamlet
and the ghost bordered upon em
barrassing affectation. Kyd's Hamlet
might, like Hampden, have sprawled
upon the stage in a palsy of shiver
ing expostulation; Shakespeare's
character never would have done
, so. But after the first act Hampden's
interpretation was convincing. The |
lines in the mercilessly self-lashing
"Now I Am Alone" soliloquy and
those in the closect scene were per
fectly read and noted. Hampden's
lack of humor was the chief flaw in
his performance.
Every line of Hamlet's brutal fun
that could possibly be read serious
j ly was read seriously; and the re
mainder of Hamlet's savage, self
inflicted satire was turned into a!
sort of mournful sarcasm.
The cast was bad. Ophelia was
( charming to look at but her mad
scene became a dismal flip-flop of
flowers and pretty fingers. The King
and Queen were played with an al
most impossible lack of imagination.
The King, instead of being a shrewd,
calculating politician, was a stolid,
porky gentleman who eyed Hamp
den with an awed amazement as if
he wished he could act as well, and
I left the audience wondering whether
! his dropsy or Hamlet's sword would
| get him first. Laertes' sing-song 1
bass ruined every scene in which he
: appeared. William Sauter's Horatio !
I was good although at times he ap
peared too aged to be a convincing |
1 young man. The grave diggers put 1
i on some clever vaudeville.
The technical side of the produc
' tion was also bad. The cutling,
which excluded the Fortinbras allu
sions and military scenes, was skill- i
fully managed with one exception:
the magnificent soliloquy, "How all
occasions do inform against mo," was
omitted. But the court scenes carried
no sense of grandeur; the atmos
phere resembled that of a depres
sion masked ball. This was due
partly to the frayed costumes, par
! ticularly those of the gaudy Hallow- (
| e'en-dressed King and Queen, partly
to the lack of reverence shown His ,
Majesty by the assembly, and mostly
by the absurd figure of the King
himself. Consequently, Hamlet's in
tense to the situation in
which he found himself—and herein
lies the tragedy of Hamlet, his ab
normally intense emotions are con
stantly out of proportion to the
; stimuli which cause them—danger-
I ously approximated farce.
There is one more performance
Saturday evening. The show is worth '

seeing because of Hampden's rather
peculiar interpretation, his excellent
voice, and because the play is Ham
let. —Stanford

CHILI) OF MANHATTAN (Colum
bia) —At the California Theatre.
There has been an increasing ten
dency during the past year to dose
otherwise dull pictures with as many
gags built about sex as possible,
probably in the hope of selling them
by grace of censorial laxity.
Working in this field, really well
opened only recently, the gagmen
have succeeded in concocting fairly
good humor, vulgar or beany, but
not sly.
"Child of Manhattan" is one of
these pictures but, good gags or no,
it remains completely artificial and
highly ridiculous. Utilizing the old
sentimental situations from a ro
mantic meeting in a taxi dance hall
to the final reunion in a Mexican
hotel—including shots of the mis
tress ruefully knitting small gar
ments —it never once approaches
reality.
Not the least illustration of this
is the leading lady's indication of
Bowery ancestry by pronouncing a
half dozen words—and only a half
dozen—in a peculiar manner; pernt,
apperntment, and so on.
Its stupid vulgarity in plot con
struction is an additional hindrance
even to a romantic or philosophic
resignation or determination to be
entertained. It is one of that great
number of pictures for which there
seems to be no adequate explana
tion, even upon financial grounds.
It is worth noting, in addition, that
the puritan eye will turn rapidly
from condemnation of celluloided
gangsters and the puritan fist will
begin to pound committee tables if
the loud twanging upon the sex
string continues indiscriminately.
