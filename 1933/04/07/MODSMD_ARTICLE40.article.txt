Things I Never
Knew Till Now
apologies to Walter Winch
el, who, 1 arn sure, will be thrilled by
the apology and whose column can
always be laughed at if not with.)
Did You Know—
That Ernie Brandstcn coached
California swimming teams before
coaching Stanford swimming
teams, and that, in his first year
as Stanford's coach, the Indians
won a swimmnig meet from Cali
fornia after many Golden Bear
years—a Brandsten-coached Stan
ford team defeating a formerly
Brandstcn - coached California
team.
That Stanford's athletic faculty is
exceptionally well educated. Tiny
Thornhill took engineering at
Pittsburgh; John Bunn graduated in
engineering from Kansas; Dink
Templeton attended Ihe Stanford
law school; and Pop Warner (who
once coached Stanford's football
team) boasts an L.L.D. degree.
That Vincc Philippi, Stanford's
Conference-loading hitter last year,
is playing wit lithe Seattle Indians
for 250 per.
That A1 Norgard, who was the
captain-elect of this year's basketball
tenia, but who was not in school and
therefore obviously unable to play
the past season, has returned to
Stanford and is eligible for both
basketball and football. A1 incident
ally returns as a married man.
That Itufe Spalding, a star of
the s(ron» - 1932-33 polo team, is
now playing with Midwick Coun
/ ' i
try Club and may meet his former
Stanford teammates in the Pacific
Coast low-goal championships to
be held at San Mateo soon.
That PSt Vestal, who will compete
in tlie gymnastics meet (that com
prises part of the Minor Sports Car
nival) at Berkeley tomorrow, broke
the Stanford-California rope-climb
ing record in his first competitive
effort in that event.
That Harry Wolter was once a
Big League baseball player, and
that Harry is so fearful of in
criminating himself in statements
to the press that he told Dink
Templeton that lie would pitch
Lefty Campbell against California
Wednesday, told me that he would
start Fred Heringer, and then sur
prised everyone including Cali
fornia by pitching Herm Estes.
That Stanford has been undefeat- .
ed in Pacific Coast intercollegiate J
swimming competition for eighteen 1
.successive years, but that the sev
eral hivh-school aquatic stars who
ai;e now Southern California fresh
men may threaten that record in a
year or two.
That Bill Laduc, Sacramento
transfer who is starring in center
field cm this year's varsity, is nick
named "Toodles."
That Ted Wiget and Keith Top
ping are the only Stanford athletes
eligible to wear both a Block and
Circle "S." Wiget received his block
for winning a national swimming
title last year (he won two more
these past two weeks), and Topping
won a block in basketball and a
circle in boxing. Keith is now out
for end in football, and may add
another letter to his collection.

That Wiget, Topping, and Stan
Anderson roomed together as
freshmen, and that history has
shown these three to be just about
the best athletes in the Class of '34.
That Baseball Manager Frank
Lloyd and former Sports Editor Bob
Wade constitute Stanford's hoarse
duet. But the roaring pair (who take
their baseball seriously, to put it
mildly) modestly refuse to accept
any credit for the brilliant record of
1 rallies when two are out established
by this year's fighting ball club.
That, to end a long controversy,
Norm Bright will never be eligible
for track at Stanford. This fast
iniler came here from a four-year
school, and Dink Templeton can
only curse his ineligibility.
That 38 men signed up for spring
j soccer practice and 83 for spring
football. Missing among the soccer
ites were Art Hearn, who is playing
I baseball; Nifty Branch, who plans a
trip to Mexico t'oon; Alex Spoehr,
who is attending the University of
Chicago; and Kelley Steele and Mel
Nichols, who are not in school.
Other than the freshmen who are
out for baseball and track, the only
missing gridder was Stan Anderson,
| who is again eligible for baseball.
That Cotto Herbert and Bud Dea
con look so much alike as to deceive
the unknowing, and that Deacon is
an inveterate eater of spinach.
That the track squad looked 'at
motion pictures of former Stanford
stars yesterday afternoon, and that
Here Labordc carefully studied the
late Eric Krenz's discus-throwing
form. After the projections, Laborde
I threw the discus 158 feet.

Members of El Cuadro Club re
cently received a letter addressed to
Mr. E. L. Cuadro.
