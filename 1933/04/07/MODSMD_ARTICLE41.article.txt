# Net men Play Ucla Here Today In Conference Tilt
## COUGHLIN BATTLES TO FEATURE TROY, BRUIN, NET MEETS 
### 
Ucla invades the Stanford campus
: this afternoon in a renewal of ten
nis warfare, which began down South
last week. The matches, contrary to
early season contraditions, will count
for the conference crown, and seven
Stanford netmen are prepared to de
feat the Bruins a second time. The
matches will commence at 2 o'clock
today on the upper varsity courts.
1 All four conference tennis teams
i will be in action this afternoon and
tomorrow in the bay district, as
California meets Southern California
over at Berkeley today and then
j U.C.L.A. tomorrow, while the Cards
tackle their hardest match of the
season here on the varsity courts at
j 2 o'clock tomorrow in their second
battle against the Trojans.
At the present time California
surprisingly leads the entire con
ference, with wins over both
Southern college net teams, and it
will be necessary for the Indians
to win both their matches to tic
with the Bears for conference lead.
Today's matches are not expected
to be particularly close, as Stanford
won against Ucla last week, six
matches to three, and could no doubt
I have made the match score even
more impressive.
However, Coach Sherman Lock
wood will not have Cosgrove avail
able for play, and this may make a
difference, particularly in the singles,
where Forney does not seem confi
dent enough to carry on conference
play.
; " New Doubles Combine
In the doubles Hugh Butler, a let -
terman from last year's squad, will
pair up with Captain Coughlin. This
! team gained considerable experience
at the end of last season when Gled
hill's absence put Coughlin and But
, ler together.

tomorrow will find the Card netmen
' anxious to avenge their 5-4 defeat,
j and to beat a team which did not
' cause any great stir in conference
I circles a few weeks ago. 1
