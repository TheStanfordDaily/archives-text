## INDIAN BABES TO MEET U.C. FROSH NINE TOMORROW IN SECOND GAME OF SERIES 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Having dropped the series opener
by a 7 to 2 count at Berkeley last
Wednesday, Stanford's frosh ball
I team does battle for the second
I time this week with a powerful
California freshman nine at 10 o'clock
tomorrow morning on the Indian
babe diamond.
Cuddeback's boys must win to
morrow's engagement in order to
have a chance for the series title.
In view of the fact that the Stan
ford boys had not worked out for
over three weeks, Wednesday's per
formance was most encouraging.
Stanford outhit the Berkeley ag
gregation six to five. Both teams
i earned two runs and played airtight
ball as far as the infields cind out
fields were concerned.
The Indian chief hope of victory
lies in the effectiveness of pitcher
Blanchard, who hurled very fine
I ball for the last seven innings Wed
nesday. If he is able to last the full
time, the babes stand at least an
even chance of breaking into the
win column.
Morgan will comprise the rest of
the yearling battery with Allen
i ready to relieve him in an emer-

gency. An opening infield of Gray
son, first; Galbraith, second; Barnett,
short; and Tremaine, third, will be
on the field for Stanford.
Hamilton, Moscrip, and Ed Clark
will hold down the fielding posts
with Marshall ready to replace Mos
crip should he be called in for re
lief chucking duty.
