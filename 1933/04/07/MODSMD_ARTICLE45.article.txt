# FROSH TRACK MEN MEET SAN MATEO, MENLO, TOMORROW
## 
### 
Entering its first triangular meet
with a record still unblemished, the
strong frosh track team encounters
San Mateo and Menlo jaysees on
Angell Field tomorrow. The three
way tilt, which starts at 10 o'clock,
will find the Papooses, like many
another post-vacation squad, a little
under full strength.
Menlo Has Strong Team
Menlo must be rated a strong ag
gregation as far as wins and losses
go, having only been conquered by
Modesto J.C. The yearlings, on basis
of past records, will probably be
able to master the situation; and
with the Little Big Meet only a week
off, they are striving to gain top
shape.
Recent improvements have been
shown by two menâ€”Ginn and
Nobs. The former hit 12 feet in the
vault, the second frosh to make
that mark. Nobs finally lived up
to his pre-season promises in the
high iump with a clean 5 feet 11
inches jump. Keen competition is
therefore in sight for the Bear
jumper next week who has stead
ily reached the same mark.
Trompas, star footballer last fall,
has come out recently for the jave
lin. He passed the 145-foot mark in
practice without any trouble, and
may reach as high as IGO feet by
next week. Sam Smith, who ran
some snappy 440's for Philip's Exe
ter, has also turned up in the last
two days. Although badly out of
shape, Smith is a big boy with a
splendid stride.
