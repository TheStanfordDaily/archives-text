# Queen Entries Not Restricted To '500'
## 
### STAN BEAUBAIRE 
Stanford's IJJ33 edition of the
Masque Ball King" Contest has
been definitely scheduled to open
one week from today, in conjunc
tion with the initial sale of bids at
that time, it was learned from
Rally Committee headquarters last
night.
Several startling developments
came forth following a hurried ses
sion of those in charge of the King
Contest with the result that defi
nite action was taken on the pleas of
campus, leaders to open the royal
election to all women.
Although the Committee had at
first ruled to restrict the competi
tion to Stanford candidates, the
overwhelming request to "let the
'500" show what they can do"
against so-called import candi
dates caused a reversal of this
decision.
Contest rules, which are very
simple, state that any campus man
who is registered in school for the
current quarter may be entered in
the contest. His backers may give
him any nickname they so desire,
but must be prepared to do this
when officially nominating him.
Votes will be sold at the rate of one
cent each, and there is no limit to

the number available.
At the time of his nomination,
however, the candidate must be pre
pared to announce his choice for
the post of Queen, in the event that
j he should win the contest. He may
| select as his running-mate any wo
man he wishes, under the revised
regulations. There will be no limi
tations imposed upon this choice.
i Campus factions are already or
i ganizing to concentrate in pushing
over a determined effort for a Stan
! ford woman as Queen, in the hope
to keep their boast that off-campus
j competition can be met and defeated
with local material.
Additional committeemen appoint
ed to handle arrangements for the
Ball, set for April 21, are: Jerry
Dunn, Yuji Imai, Bob Quinn, Al
' Rodda, cloakroom; Ondy Martin,
• lighting; Woody Malonc, platforms.
