# Trackmen In Practice Tilt
## 
### 
Wox-king out in the Stanford Sta
dium oval for the first time this
year, "Dink" Templeton's varsity
trackmen will engage in a practice
meet this afternoon, weather per
mitting.
Full distances will be run in all
events with the idea of acquainting
varsity men with probable condi
tions of the forthcoming California
and Trojan meets.
With the opening of spring quar
ter, a number of point-getting Stan- :
ford men wei'e rendered eligible.
Phil Morentin, whose specialty is |
distance, and the longer the better,
is now enabled to compete. Les
Hables and Paul Zuches are also re
turned to favor, but Zaches is suf
fering a leg injury and his case is
problematical.
Meanwhile, dopesters who are at
tempting to fathom the possible
strength of Bob Kiesel in the com
ing California meet, as well as the |
California Relays and 1.C.4-A. com
petition, are stumped. To them the
blond Californian l-esembles the
lamed "off again, on again, gone
again" feller in his aberrating career, i
At present, Kiesel seems to be defi
nitely off the cinders.
