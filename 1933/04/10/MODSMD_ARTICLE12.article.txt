# Student Drinks Gallon, Passes Sobriety Tests
## 
### FRANCES AYRES 
A gallon of 3.2 per cent beer is
not intoxicating.
This verdict was reached yesterday
when a Stanford student success
fully passed the Palo Alto Police
Department's sobriety tests after he
had consumed eight bottles of the
new legal brew. The experiment was
witnessed by three students who
said that the patient had no thtli
culty in performing such feats as

walking a straight line, placing pins
into the correct hole, and keeping
his balance.
His temperature indicated no
change after drinking the beer and
there was no dilation of the eye
pupilâ€”both considered tests of j
drunkenness.
"This 3.2 per cent beer is ex
hilarating, but it certainly is not
intoxicating," said the patient at the i
conclusion of the tests.
