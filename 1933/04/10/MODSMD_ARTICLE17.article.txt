# CARD AQUATIC TEAMS RETAIN COAST CROWNS
## Clark Sets New Record; Wiget, Taranik Star In Water Polo 
### Willard Bungay 
Capturing six first places, :i new j
j Pacific Coast Intercollegiate rccord, 1
j and points in every event, Stanford's j
swimming team won its 19th con- j
j secutive Pacific Coast southern divi
sion championship in the new Cali
| fonia pools at Berkeley Friday. The
â–  Indians amassed 56 points, twice as
many as California, who placed sec- :
J ond. U. 5.0., with 27, and U.C.L.A.
with 6, were third and fourth, re
spectively.
Likewise the Stanford water polo
team avenged last year's defeat by
trouncing U.S.C. 8 to 1 in an un
interesting contest in which the In
dians were continually peppering the
Trojans' goal. II was only the great
work of Bruce Kidder at goal guard !
i that kept the Stanford score down. :
Wiget Outstanding
Ted Wiget, as expected, was the
, outstanding figure of the two-day i
| aquatic meet. He was high-point
I man in the swimming events with
j 12 points, winning the 440- and 220-
j yard races with ease and swimming
] on the winning relay team. Saturday
| Wiget and Vlad Taranik were out-
I standing offensively for Stanford in ;
I the water polo contests.
I The greatest sensation of the
meet was the 220-yard breaststrokc
race in which Boh Clark, last
year's champion, successfully
thrust hack the challenge of Dean
| Langworthy, California star, and
j established a new Pacific Coast
j rccord of 2:37.1, Kidder of U.S.C.
! was third, and Ray Wilbur of
| Stanford fourth. This record gives
I Stanford every Pacific Coast rcc
j ord in the long pool.
Captain Fred Tebbetts of the ;
Cards won a thrilling 150-yard back
stroke duel from Earl Plescia, last
year's champion. After leading the '
entire distance, Tebbetts barely ;
i managed to touch out the Trojan
star in a close finish.
Triolo Secontf
Jimmy Triolo, Stanford sopho- j
more, gave promise of becoming a
second Wiget when he followed the '
national titleholder to the tape in
both the 440 and 220 to beat out
Smithson of California. Triolo cov- j
ered the quarter-mile 20 seconds j
faster than he ever has before and j
the 220 about 8 seconds faster.
Gordy Graves split the dashes
i with Browne of U.S.C., winning
the 100, in which Browne took
second and following the Trojan ;
flash to the tape in the 50. Dick
1 Hirsch of Stanford placed third in
i both events.
In the 400-yard relay, which the j
| Indians won, Wiget swam the first
j 100 yards in approximately 53.4,
I over two seconds faster than the
time which won the dash event. The
national record in this event is 52.8. I
Trounce U.C.|L.A.
Stanford had little difficulty prov- |
| ing its superiority in water polo. The
j Indian mermen trounced U.C.L.A. i
j 6 to 3 in the morning. The varsity
! rolled up a 6 to 1 lead and let, the
reserves hold the Uclans to two
I goals in the last five minutes. The '
I same procedure was followed in the
j California game in the afternoon,
I except that the Bears lost G to 2.
Against U.S.C., which had beaten
California 3 to 1 and U.C.L.A. 7 to 5
in two overtime periods, Stanford
played its best game of the year to :
smother the Trojans 8 to 1. Stan-
| ford's new attack completely Ijowil
dered the boys from Los Angeles
and established the Cards as one of
the strongest, if not the strongest, |
college team in the country.
