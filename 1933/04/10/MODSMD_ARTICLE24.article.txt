# BEN'S MUSCLES MAY MEND FOR MAY 6TH MEET
## Gray May Be Out Of U.C. Clash With Injured Back Muscle DINK'S HOPE BLASTED Dunn, Lyman Pass 50 Feet, Laborde, 49½ Feet 
### 
A draughty wind was blowing in
the Stanford Stadium Friday after
j noon. It was the third race of the
! day, the 440, and across the field
from the straightaway, a little group
I surrounded Dink Templeton where
!he sat, eyes concentrated on that
part of the track where it emerged
from the Stadium walls into the
■ brightness of the field.
Four men came out of the obscur
-1 ity, running fast, bunched and fight
ing for the lead. Around the turn
they were led by sophomore A1
Blackmail with Frank Fullenwider
| challenging his place. Art Rice
j trailed the leaders; they finished in
! the same order.
Depression Hits
As the time was announced 50.2
| seconds, Bill Ellington came hurry
j ing from the straightaway. "Ben
| cramped up," he said tersely. And
■ thus began a very depressing week
| end for Coach Templeton and the
j whole of his varsity squad, a de
i pression soon felt by every man on
j the Stanford campus where the word
j was speedily flung around that Ben
I Eastman had tied up.
Eastman is definitely out for at
least three weeks, and although
he may rcceover sufficiently to run
one event in the second U.S.C.
! meet, May (>, it seems impossible
that he will compete before that
date.
The scattering of spectators re
ceived another shock when Gray did
not enter the shot put. He lias an
injured back muscle and probably
will be out of the- California meet
this Saturday. True, Dunn, and Ly
man passed 50 feet, and Laborde's
49 feet, 6 inch put was his best to
date.
Nothing Startling
The remainder of the practice
meet was in keeping with the gloomy
j theme. Times and distances were
not startling, certainly not to be
compared with U.S.C.'s Saturday
practice meet marks.
The California meet comes this
Saturday, but although Brutus Ham
ilton is proving himself a great
coach, and it .still remains the Big
Meet, eyes arc turned toward the
South, where another great Trojan
team is being fashioned.
