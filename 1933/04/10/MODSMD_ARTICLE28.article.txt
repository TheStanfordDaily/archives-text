# Scientific Love-Making Proposed in Utah High Schools
## 
### 
One Dr. K. K. Kriekscn, philosophy professor at the
I Diversity ol' I tali, has proposed that courscs in "court
ship" he offered in the curricula of all senior high schools
in his state. The proposition is not without merit. It is an
indication that at least one college professor has a desire
to teach his charges something practical and liveable.
The inevitable problem of offering such a course to hilÂ»h
school students would be the employment of suitable in
structors. Courtship is probably one of the few social con
stants in an otherwise changing world, but even courtship,
in the Prohibition era, has its new slants. It is doubtful
whether the present crop of high school teachers could put
across anything particularly helpful.
Ilow about drafting courtship instructors from the
ranks of the IO.'M co-eds? The trouble with that idea is
that the vast majority of today's college women, either ad
mittedly or secretly are in college with matrimony as their
goal. The co-eds who are really proficient in the subject all
get married, and that lets them out. College women who
fail to "get theirman" often become high school teachers,
but their ability to teach the new course in courtship is
necessarily (pi est ion able.
That leaves the senior man as the remaining prospect.
He knows his love-making, and he knows the all-important
methods of getting the best results economically. Hut he'll
never get the job. Dr. Krickscn may find he'll have to teach
his scientific courtship himself.
