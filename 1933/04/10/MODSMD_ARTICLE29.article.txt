# A
						Horrid Word Is Suggested to the Nation's Individualists

Nullification, like spit, is a horrid word.
At the very suggestion of such ;i procedure, strong Con
stitutionalists shudder. Although the repeal of an objec
tionable section of the nation's instrument of government
is accepted, not without reluctance, the more candid
method of nullification meets with vigorous Opposition.
At the present lime, the movement for repeal of the
Constitution's two most famous paragraphs is gathering
speed and sound. Two states have already emphatically
declared their views on prohibition. But, as has often been
pointed out, repeal may be blocked by 13 states —13 agra
rian states, poor in products and scanty in population.
This is a possibility regarded by wet forces as unjust
and undemocratic. However, if the repeal movement meets
with such a blockade, another road will still be open, the
road of nullification. Congress, by refusing to vote appro
priations for the prohibition service, can repeal prohibition
as effectually as though 13 agrarian states were not voting
dry.
Precedent for such procedure is ample. Three other
amendments, the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth
have been effectively nullified throughout their close to
7(1 years of alleged operation.
* It may be a horrid word, nullification, hut it may also
be the last resort of the nation's liberals.
