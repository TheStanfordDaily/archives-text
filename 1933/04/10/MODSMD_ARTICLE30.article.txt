# The 						Spirit of U.S.C. Is Evident in Palo Alto Theatres
## 
### 
The super-collegiale atmosphere and altitude of U.S.C.
and certain other coast universities has long been scored
and scorned by the average Stanford student. In fact the
Farm has taken a certain pride in its self-styled blase and
reserved spirit. II has become rather proud of the some
limes applied appelation, "the Harvard of the West."
This feeling of superiority is likely to fall rather flat,
however, after a visit to one of Palo Alto's theatres. Here
the super-collegiate spirit, and everything the phrase con
notes, is dished up in great style.
The show, whether good or bad, is certain to be almost
obliterated by the wits, nit- and half-, in "nigger heaven"
and on the main floor. And Hollywood does occasionally
produce a picture which is worth seeing and hearing. Cer
lainly ntfne of the remarks from Ihe gallery are worth the
'2."> cent admission fee.
A! times Ihe remarks are rather apt and callcd-for as
personal criticisms but, after all, they should remain per
sonal. II is not difficult to place the wise-cracker as a show
off and loud-mouth, the type who heckles public speakers
and enjoys a feeling of pleasure when people crane their
necks in his direction.
Probably a great many of the stupid and childish re
marks may be traced lo a guillv embarrassment over sen
timental or suggestive pictures. Those making them are
openly, and with a splendid lack of taste, admitting that
Ihey have, to put it plainly, dirty minds.
Freshmen, junior college transfers, and local high school
students are undoubtedly responsible for a good part of
these disturbances, and for Ihem there is some excuse. For
students who have been on Ihe Farm long enough to absorb
Ihe essence of its spirit there is no excuse.
