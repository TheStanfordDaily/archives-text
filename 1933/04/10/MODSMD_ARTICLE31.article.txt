## PALO ALTO—CITY OF SIN 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
The story you heard at your
mother's knee is wrong; Palo Alto
: is not the virgin city of spotless
! purity. No, behind her dry white;
veil lurks the familiar beer breath
i of other sin sinks like Menlo, San
Francisco, and Washington, D.C.
While it is true that beer cannot be
purchased legally in that city across
| the highway, according to their city
I attorney, it is legal to drink beer In
Paly.
Ctudents, where is your con
science? Must we absorb knowledge
; within a burp of a place which per
mits its citizens to drink one of
j demon rum's most insidious off
spring? We refer to nothing else but
beer! Here, within a bottle's throw
of our own fair campus, pure and
dry by edict, American citizens arc
[allowed to sully their lips with that
vile destroyer of the Home—the
Hearth —the Virtues, and everything
that is dear and sacred to our coun
try—we refer to nothing else but
beer!
It is still illegal to drink beer in
Palo Alto stores, streets, automo
biles, and even their alleys. But in |
their homes, the citizens of Palo Alto
can lap up the suds unmolested by
the prodding finger of the Law. Is
nothing sacred? The Home—key
stone and headstone of our national
life —foundation and pinnacle of our
country's glory—is the Home to be
turned into a common, ordinary beer
garden? Is nothing sacred? Woe is
Palo Alto. Alas. Is there no Moses
to lead them from their wilderness

of sin? Is there no Lincoln to strike
off their shackles of ignorance?
Palo Alto will not sully itself with
selling beer—which, after all, is the
harmless part of the process anyway
one looks at it. It is impossible to
get drunk SELLING beer. It is even
impossible to get a beer breath by
SELLING beer. The '"evil" comes in
drinking beer; and that is the thing
that Palo Alto sanctions.
There is something in consistent
prudery—something pitiful. But
where docs Paly stand? —one foot
high and dry and the other in a
buckct of beer. The perfect straddle.
The fore-foot is the dry one. No
beer signs will float in Palo Alto's
breeze. But beer odors will be wafted
from beneath smug doors and the
quiet pop of opening bottles will be
heard in the still summer night.
The situation looks like a perfect
nose-cutting procedure. Palo Alto
will not protect its citizens from
alcohol. They will merely force them
to trek past the city limits—hit the
road to Menlo—to procure beer. Yet
the city is losing thousands of dol
lars in business and taxes. Paly eat
ing places will probably be hardest
hit but grocers and the rest will also
feel the self-inflicted lash.
The Palo Alto Times in a Saturday
editorial speaks of the puerile judg
ment; of the frosh who pulled an
admittedly foolish radio hoax about
a Roosevelt assassination. It is some
what comforting to realize that
puerility does not stop at the High
way.
