THE GREAT MAGOO — By Ben
Ilecht and Gene Fowler. Covici-
Friede. 1933. (At the Gordon
Strawbridge Circulating Library:
Stanford Union.)
In Nowel Coward's Collected
Sketches and Lyrics there is to be
found a very amusing skit ' made
simply by changing a part of the
second act of his "Private Lives"
into Cockney dialect and setting it
in a wretched Soho room.
To people-who know the original,
this is amusing because of its incon
gruity. And Coward has wisely kept
it short so that it is highly amusing
for the short time it is sustained.
In "The Great Magoo," Bon Hecht
and Gene Fowler have, somewhat un
suspectingly, done much the same
thing over a more strenuous length.
Their play is concerned with love
among the yrtists of Conoy Island.
The setting offers considerable pos
sibilities for hearty salt humor, but
from the first the authors look flip
pantly down upon their characters
and, even then, instead of making
the play a satire, sentimentalize it
badly.
This flippancy is reflected in the
speech of the characters who talk oi
things consistent with their stated
characters but in a manner quite
foreign to them. In this way, by aid
ing their gags, the authors have lost
sight of their atmosphere. The play
becomes a scries of vaudeville acts,
loosely hung upon a romantic plot.
Thus the play is not as integrally
built as, for instance, "The Front
Page" (Hecht-MacArthur), for while
Ihere are humorous scenes, these
scenes are static.

And when the plot, slow-starting
as it is, finally unfolds, the colorful
rough, carnival characters are seen
to be a boquet of lilies done up in
brown paper — concealing broken
hearts with vices which cannot harm
their essentially romantic and un
soiled souls.
Thus, the play is faulty in tone,
divided between aloof flippancy and
dismal sentimentality. The original
intention was probably to make the
play satiric; but this purpose was
lost about the time that the story
broke through the gay-laden atmos
phere. As it stands, the satirically
described characters cannot copceal
a stupid and contradicting plot.
The play has been attractively
printed, with colored reproductions
of the original production's decor by
Herman Rosse. It lasted a week on
Broadway earlier this season.

simply by changing a part of the
second act of his "Private Lives"
into Cockney dialect and setting it
in a wretched Soho room.
To people-who know the original,
this is amusing because of its incon
gruity. And Coward has wisely kept
it short so that it is highly amusing
for the short time it is sustained.
In "The Great Magoo," Bon Hecht
and Gene Fowler have, somewhat un
suspectingly, done much the same
thing over a more strenuous length.
Their play is concerned with love
among the yrtists of Conoy Island.
The setting offers considerable pos
sibilities for hearty salt humor, but
from the first the authors look flip
pantly down upon their characters
and, even then, instead of making
the play a satire, sentimentalize it
badly.
This flippancy is reflected in the
speech of the characters who talk oi
things consistent with their stated
characters but in a manner quite
foreign to them. In this way, by aid
ing their gags, the authors have lost
sight of their atmosphere. The play
becomes a scries of vaudeville acts,
loosely hung upon a romantic plot.
Thus the play is not as integrally
built as, for instance, "The Front
Page" (Hecht-MacArthur), for while
Ihere are humorous scenes, these
scenes are static.

And when the plot, slow-starting
as it is, finally unfolds, the colorful
rough, carnival characters are seen
to be a boquet of lilies done up in
brown paper — concealing broken
hearts with vices which cannot harm
their essentially romantic and un
soiled souls.
Thus, the play is faulty in tone,
divided between aloof flippancy and
dismal sentimentality. The original
intention was probably to make the
play satiric; but this purpose was
lost about the time that the story
broke through the gay-laden atmos
phere. As it stands, the satirically
described characters cannot copceal
a stupid and contradicting plot.
The play has been attractively
printed, with colored reproductions
of the original production's decor by
Herman Rosse. It lasted a week on
Broadway earlier this season.
