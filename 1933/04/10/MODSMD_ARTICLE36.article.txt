I The Editor, Sir:
After reading your "flowery" dis
j sertation concerning the "five mil
lion dollar death-dealing monster,''
: the Akron, I could not help but
write in defense of this ship.
You have classified the Akron dis
aster with that of the Shenandoah,
j They are in nowise alike.
■ The Shenandoah was destroyed by
| intense air forces just as many ships
| have been destroyed by great wave
forces. After the accident, it was
i lightly realized that if an airship
. could not be built stronger than the
: Shenandoah, we had better discon
j tinue the construction of such ships.
The Akron was built after the Los
1 Angeles had created a perfect record
| for 6 years. This new ship, Akron,
J could not only fly (non-stop-13,000
i miles) 2V 2 times as far and half
! again as fast as the Shenandoah, but
; more important, its factor of safety
1 was 3 times as great.. It is not diffi
j cult to see why the airship program
was continued.
The Akron, flying only twice its
length above the Atlantic, was de
j stroyed upon impact when a great
j vertical gust forced it into the sea,
before the fall could be checked. The
1 ship could hardly bo expected to be
j a good submarine also. Is it fair to
blame the airship or its operator?
! Dr. Eckener said: ". . . the ship was
flying much too low in a storm."
The destruction of R-101 was simi
lar to that of the Akron. The crew
I was content to fly this ship within
i half its length from the ground. It
; was forced down and before its fall
j could be checked it had run aground.
Could the airship be blamed for such
! maneuvering?
We do not blame the airplane
j which is destroyed due to no struc-
I tural fault, the ship that sinks after
! striking an iceberg or a reef, nor the
