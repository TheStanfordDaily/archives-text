## CUTE LITTLE DEVIL, AIN'T HE? 
### OLD DR. ALGAR 
"A droll little mite is the leuco
cyte, scooting here & there, sending
out inquisitive pseudopodia (pro
longations) as does the amoeba. Po
liceman of the blood stream, it scav
enges waste, destroys certain bac
teria, ignoring some and gobbling
others with gusto."--Time Magazine.
A droll little mite is the leucocyte,
Scavenger foe of the neophyte
Germs that with gusto
And uncontrolled lusto
He gobbles . . . Oh boy what an
appetite!
