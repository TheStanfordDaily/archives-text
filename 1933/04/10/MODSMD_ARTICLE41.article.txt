# CLASS OF '35 WOMEN PROVE RULE THAT "500" CROW WISER AS YEARS PASS ALONG
## 
### ELIZABETH PAINE 
Every year in every way they
grow smarter and smarter.
That the women of the Class of '35
are no exception is shown hy Dean
Mary Yost's report. Of the 88. none
"rolied" or was put on "pro" her
first quarter. Only four went
'"minus."
Reassuring as this sounds, the
women are reminded that they are
not living up to their intellectual

possibilities. Too much social life is
the Dean's explanation.
Although .>-he does not attribute
the lapse to the 2:30 lockout rule,
in force for the past two years, Dean
Yost points out lhat the regulation
does not diminish the activities of
the social butterfly.
Boxing matches in Siam frequent
ly are ended by one of the pugilists
dying of malaria.
