Mr. Ben Bangs Eastman,
room 241
Palo Alto Hospital
Palo Alto, California
Ben:
You know, Ben, very few people
pay much attention to the heading
of letters. Most of us rush through
to the last couple of words, and then
decide whether the epistle deserves
an answer by the intensity of pas
sion contained in the finishing
phrase.
Bui the address of this letter is
important. Important and tragic. You
must, receive just about as much
]. leasure from reading that heading
a.-; I did writing it. And if addressing
this letter to you at the hospital is
the greatest pleasure I'll ever get in
life, and if (as the Cit profs told us
both), happiness is the goal of life,
thf>n we're wasting our time here on
this 3.2 per cent planet.
As everyone knows by now, Ben,
you're in the hospital because you
pulled or strained a muscle Friday ;
while trying to pace A1 Blackmail in
a trial 440. And, as everyone also
knows, that, injury is important to
California and to U.S.C., and is all
important to Stanford.
But it is more important to you, '
Ben. 1 hate sentimental or maudlin
persons, but there is something
wrong when the finest middle-dis
tance runner who ever attended
Stanford or California (or any other
school) will never hold a Big Meet
record. And you never will.
I remember when you were only j
an unknown sophomore, Ben, and
broke the tape in three Big Meet
races to help Stanford roll up a new
scoring record of 101 2-3 points. You
out-finished Maynor Shove and Ike
Hables in a 48.3 quarter, you took
the 880 in 1:56.6, and then you an
chored the relay team.
Then, last year, you again broke
three tapes but no records. As I re
member it, Dink and Bill were sav
ing you for Troy and asked you just
to win your events, and anyway the
new California track was slow. You
ran 49.8 and 1:58.8, and you were
supposed to break Bud Spencer's
440 record (48 flat) and Bill Rich
ardson's half-mile record (1:53,8) J
this year. But now that's that.
Even more important and more
tragic (at least to a larger group of
persons) than your inability to ever
hold a Big Meet record are the re- 1
verberations of your sore leg on
the S.C. meet. I was sitting in Dink's
living-room, listening moi'e than
talking, when he admitted that, be- i
cause a certain Ben Eastman would'
run for Stanford, we had a chance
against S.C. Dink figured that the
javelin and pole-vault were even,
that Stanford weight strength would
compensate S.C. jumping strength,
that, if Ollie Amdahl is in shape, he
and Phil Morentin would get back
the eight points in the two-mile that
the Trojans should win in the mile,
and that Les Hables, Jimmy Willson,
Gus Meier, and Cotto Herbert would
keep the dash and hui'dle points
about even.
That left the middle distances and
the relay, where you would have
crashed through the winning points.
And now you're out.
It's tough on you and it's tough
on Stanford, but, as you said, "Can
got it worse." You're the captain, 1
Ben, and let's hope the fellows can
win a couple of meets for you if not
with you. â€”Dick Strouse
