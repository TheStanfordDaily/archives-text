# BABE SPIKEMEN TRIUMPH OVER JAYSEE TEAMS
## 
### 
Finishing their pre-Little Big Mset
season with a 100 per cent batting
average, Coach Ellington's Papoose
spikemen downed San Mateo and
Menlo Jaysees, their seventh straight
victims, here Saturday, with the
scoreboard registering 79 1-4 to
69 3-4 to 13, respectively.
Friday the California Cubs will
journey to the Farm to meet the
Stanford frosh. Advance indications,
always somewhat unreliable, show
the Indian babes to be 20 points
superior. Both teams are variable
quantities, but a tremendous num
ber of upsets will be needed to put
the Berkeley squad in the running.
Menlo proved an unusually weak
opponent, but the San Mateo team
more than made up the difference
and gave the frosh a close battle.
King, of Menlo, won the only event
for his team, the discus, an event
that generally reads as a clean sweep
for the frosh.
Nimmo, the consistent star, came
home winner in mile and two-mile
events. In the two-mile he could
have stretched his lead to embar
rassing dimensions, had he been
so inclined.
Klopstcok beat Kingsbury at 15.5
seconds in the high hurdles.
Johnny Reisner garnered three
places for Stanford: second in a 10.1
century; second in the 220; fourth
in the broad jump.
San Mateo won the relay, notwith
standing a 51.8 lap by Dellinger, who
gained 10 yards on Stallard, winner
of the 440 for the Jaysee.
Cottrell, still on the upgrade,
jumped 5 feet, 11 3-4 inches.
