# ERRORS GIVE 5-4 VICTORY TO U.C. FRESHMEN NINE
## 
### 
Four costly Stanford errors and
inability to score in the pinches
made it possible for California's
frosh baseball nine to defeat the
Stanford babe horsehiders, 5 to 4,
Saturday morning on the Indian
yearling ball diamond. The Berkeley
victory gave the Cal boys the series,
they having won the first game by a
7 to 2 count.

Stanford outhit the Bear cubs, 9
to 7, but could not make the blows
count. One tally in the first, sixth,
eighth, and ninth innings was the
extent of the Indian attack, while
Cal counted once in the fourth and
twice in both the eighth and ninth
cantos.
Coach Murray Cuddeback sur
prised the dopesters by starting Ed
Galbraith, erstwhile second baseman,
on the mound. Galbraith chucked
effective ball, limiting the Berkeley
team to seven singles. However, he
allowed them to bunch hits in the
eighth and ninth innings and this,
with an error and a walk thrown in,
was enough to give the invaders
four of their five markers.
Bones Hamilton poled out a homer
in the sixth inning. Stanford con
tributed the lone double play of the
contest in the first inning, Clark to
Barnett to Grayson.
Shining lights for the Bear cubs
were Hardt and Thorell, who com
prised the battery. They were given
excellent support, the entire Cali
fornia team performing in errorless
fashion. .
