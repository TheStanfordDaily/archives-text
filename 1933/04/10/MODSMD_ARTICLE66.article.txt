# U.C. SMASHES CARD BALL HOPES WITH 7-3 VICTORY
## 
### Frank Tremaine 
California's pennant-bound base
ball machine kicked Stanford's
championship hopes almost out of
( sight here Saturday when the Bears
i went on a batting spree in the tenth
inning to score four runs and take
the second game of the Big Series,
7 to 3.
After tieing the score in the sixth
inning by pushing two runs caross
the plate and having the game al
most within their grasp with the
winning run on base in both the
seventh and eighth frames, the In
dians watched five California rattle
j into the outfield and four Bears
I score.
Sanchez opened the inning with a
triple to center and Jacobson's single j
scored him. Kyle forced Jacobson
at second and was safe himself, tak- 1
ing second when Mclntyre drove a
one-base hit to left. Sparling's dou
ble scored them both and he counted
when Thompson singled after Wolf
i man had gone out.
Stanford scored first in the sec
ond to take the lead when Liver mo re
was hit by a pitched ball, went to
! second on Irsfeld's sacrifice, and
j came home when Woolley singled
over second.
Jim Woolley was the big noise in
the Stanford attack, driving in all
three runs. After California had
scored three times in the third and
| fourth innings, Miles walked after
one was out in the sixth and Liver
! more and Irsfeld followed with
singles to fill the bases. Woolley
came through with his second hit to
score Miles and Livermore.
This so destroyed Clint Evans'
faith in Joe Gallison, on the mound
for California, that he derricked him
in favor of Bob Saunders who im
mediately put a stop to the Card
rally.
Irsfeld and Mallatratt both gath
ered three safeties for the Indians

and Thompson hit three times for
California. The box score:
