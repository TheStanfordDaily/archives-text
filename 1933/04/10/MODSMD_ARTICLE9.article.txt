# 'Suds' Sales Fall Here; No 'Drunks' Arrested
## 
### 
Menlo beermen enjoyed little of
the wave of prosperity reported to
have swept over San Francisco dur
ing the week-end sale of 3.2 per
cent beer. After the first-hour rush
Menlo soft drink proprietors re
corded a leveling trade. Late last
night sales had dwindled consider
ably, Stanford students composing
the bulk of the trade.
Both Palo Alto and Menlo police
stations reported a qui'et week-end.
Neither office booked any "drunks"
or "disorderlies."
Arnold Rumwell, Palo Alto City
Attorney, commented Saturday on
the legality of arresting transporters
of the beer. He said: "In my opinion,
neither the charter provisions nor
the city ordinances prevent the in
dividual personally transporting to
his home within the city, beer pur
chased outside the city limits. The
ordinances prohibit the transporta
tion or possession of intoxicating
liquor, but since Congress has de
fined intoxicating liquor so as not
to include 3.2 per cent beer, said
ordinance will not apply."
Speakeasy trade was steady over
the week-end with but few demands
for "hard liquors." One proprietor
who refused to have anything to do
with the new three-point-two re
ported a far below normal trade. A
$300 beer profit was claimed as Sat
urday's receipts by a small roadside
lunch counter.
Bread distributors were hard
pressed to supply rye bread de
mands. Cheese sandwiches and
frankfurters were popular "acces
sories."

Prices ranged from 10 cents a
glass in local soft drink parlors to 50
cents a bottle in San Francisco ho
tels and clubs. Average price was
placed at 15 cents a bottle or $1.40
