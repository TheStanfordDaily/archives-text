# INJURED BEARS MAY SURPRISE INDIAN OUTFIT
## Stanford Squad Weakened By Loss Of Eastman In Big Meet NEW CAL TRACK COACH Brutus Hamilton Mentor Of California Team 
### Francis Hamilton 
Yesterday Stanford's varsity track
me nended a two-day wake over
die remains of their blasted hopes
of a U.S.C. victory and went earn
estly to work preparing for the very
live opponent the} Jmeet on Edwards
Field this Saturd y
This fortieth fimial Isig Meet

Hears ir. Ate at the; are going
to celcbratc the inaugural by mak
ing things just as hot for the Car
dinals as possible.
This preceding paragraph caused
Gus, th" freshman wit, to cynically
mutter something about "the mind
is willing, but the flesh is weak,"
denoting that such may apply to the
fate of the Bear this week. Of course,
no one allows U.C. more than a
iieeting chance to score a decent _
point total.
Nevertheless, we harbor a hunch
that the old shaggy animal is going
to perk up, clear the cinders out of
his eyes, and do some tall scamper
ing against Stanford, if for nothing
more than that it is the Big Meet.
And with the Indian morale not
in the best of shape after the loss
of l'lastman, the impetus of a new
roach, the return to competition of
some wayward stars previously on
the hospital list, and their prestige
as a box office attraction, which
demands that California re-estab
lish itself as a threat on the track
—everything points toward the
Hlne and Gold's making its best
bid in recent Big Meet history.
Suppose that Mr. Kiesel, "Finne
gan" Kiesel to you, should heal suf
ficiently from his late horse ride to
do something for his alma mater
Saturday. Of course, "Finnegan" is
supposed to be strictly hors de com
bat at present, but as his namesake,
he may be "on again" and running
hard against Mr. Les Hables, "010
Abe" Hables, who would stagger
down the runway on crtuches it
necessary to win a point for Stan
ford.
Mr. Kiesel may well be on hand
Saturday, with the rest of the ailing
Californians. Remember, this is
U.C.'s last meet of the season, and
they will be ready to shoot the
works.

his eyes, and do some tall scamper
ing against Stanford, if for nothing
more than that it is the Big Meet.
And with the Indian morale not
in the best of shape after the loss
of l'lastman, the impetus of a new
roach, the return to competition of
some wayward stars previously on
the hospital list, and their prestige
as a box office attraction, which
demands that California re-estab
lish itself as a threat on the track
—everything points toward the
Hlne and Gold's making its best
bid in recent Big Meet history.
Suppose that Mr. Kiesel, "Finne
gan" Kiesel to you, should heal suf
ficiently from his late horse ride to
do something for his alma mater
Saturday. Of course, "Finnegan" is
supposed to be strictly hors de com
bat at present, but as his namesake,
he may be "on again" and running
hard against Mr. Les Hables, "010
Abe" Hables, who would stagger
down the runway on crtuches it
necessary to win a point for Stan
ford.
Mr. Kiesel may well be on hand
Saturday, with the rest of the ailing
Californians. Remember, this is
U.C.'s last meet of the season, and
they will be ready to shoot the
works.
