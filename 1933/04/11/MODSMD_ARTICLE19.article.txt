# College Is Speeding Up Says "John Mistletoe"

"Hel-lo," wilh a cheery rise on
J the second sylU-' , rang over the
telephone, and Christopher Morley
said, "come on up, bless your heart!"
"John Mistletoe,"' as some refer
j to him, was enjoying an after-break
i fast .smoke which proved to be a
j before-lunch smoke, interrupted
â–  frequently by the telephone. His
j choise-lounge by the window af
| forded a view of a busy part of San
j Francisco, which he is visiting for
j the first time. And evidently he has
j had a good time, for he remarked
j that people were so kind to him that
| he sort of "had the jitters." Hardly
had he mentioned his cordial rc-
I ception when the telephone rang
! with an invtiation to lunch at the
Hoovers.' So yesterday afternoon
Christopher Morley paid Stanford
his fust call, in the company of Mr.
Hoover.
The topic of college brought out
the information that the author of
i "Parnassus on Wheels' and ihe re-

cent "Human Being," might have j
been a physicist ("liked the sound
of the word"), but was somewhat
discouraged, among other things, by
the accidental intake of a mouthful
of kerosene and mercury.
"College is speeding up," accord
ing to Christopher Morley. "We just
rambled around and let things sink
in," he reminisced, suggesting that
the present generation tries to pro
fessionalize too early. He is far from
dogmatic, but believes that the Hours
spent by "John Mistletoe" on Con
rad and Hazlitt were worth more
than multitudinous activities of j
small importance.
Accelerated conversation as the j
luncheon hour drew nearer disclosed
the fact that the hero of "Where the '
Blue Begins," Gissing, grew quite'
savage after publication of the book j
and had to go to the country; that
the Urchin is now sixteen; that Mr. [
Morley would leave tomorrow; and
that it was unfortunately time to J
"spread the iridescent wings and fly."
