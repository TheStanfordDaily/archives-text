# EXPAND MONEY, FARM AID HEADS TELL CONGRESS
## Roosevelt Asks Renewal Of Work On Power Plant At Muscle Shoals 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 10 (/!>) - A
campaign to add currency expan- !
sion a.s a rider to the administra- '
tion's luige farm relief program was j
being formulated in Congressional
cloakrooms today as the broad agri- j
cultural price lifting and mortgage j
refinancing measure plodded along
its tortuous course through the Sen
ate.
Republican and Democratic blocs!
were quietly at work on inflationary j
plans—whose authors preferred t<>
remain publicly silent—in line with i
the Senate agricultural committee's
recommendation for monetary ex
pansion to aid the farmer.
President Roosevelt put his Ten- 1
nessee valley program before Con
gress today in a message asking
rehabilitation of the Muscle
Shoals, Alabama, power and ni
trate plant.
Tne message said:
"The continued idleness of a great ;
national investment in the Tennes
see valley leads me to ask Congress j
for legislation necessary to enlist this j
project in the service of the people." |
On the Farm Bill itself, the Senate j
worked methodically but slowly.
Leaders were confident nevertheless !
that a final vote could be had by j
Thursday or Friday and the measure j
sent back to the House for consider- I
ation of the many Senate changes i
and additions, such as the Simpson '
Production-Cost Guaranty Plan. {
Form of Proposals Undecided
What form the currency expansion
proposals would take had not defi
nitely been decided by their spon
sors, but one under consideration
was to permit issuance of currency
against the $2,000,000,000 bonds is
sue proposed to finance the moitgage j
program.
This was a subject in which Sena- j
tor Borah was made interested, I
while Senator Wheeler weighed the '
thought of proposing rcmonetization j
of silver as an amendment and Sen- j
ator Thomas considered submitting |
an outright inflation proposal.
