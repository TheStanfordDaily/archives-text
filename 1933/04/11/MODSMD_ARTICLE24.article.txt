# Bookstore Quiz Ends; Economy Moves Proposed
## 10 Per Cent Salary Cut Recommended; Committee Advises Reduction in Staff From 14 to 12, Suggests Revised Advertising Campaign Policy 
### 
A (en per cent salary cut and a reduction in personnel from 14 to 12. A
carefully conceived advertising policy to increase sales. A few minor im
provements in methods of handling stock.
With these as its major recommendations, the Bookstore Committee came
out of a three-month seclusion among bookstore facts, figures, and argu
ment yesterday afternoon to show operators of the store how they can
save students $1700 yearly without noticeably impairing the quality of
service.
Added to the $2600 lopped off the yearly expenses by the store manage
ment with cuts that went into effect February first, two weeks after the
committee began work, the total yearly saving brought about since the
—— Daily first advocated an investiga-

j tion would amount to $7300, or more
than twice the figure paid out in
' rebates last year.
The directors of the Bookstore
are under no technical obligation
to follow (lie recommendations of
the committee, since the Associated
Students have no hand in the
operation of the store.
The report follows:
After a thorough investigation of
the Stanford Bookstore, the commit
tee, appointed by the Student Body
! President, Bill Corbus, submits the
following recommendations:
1. A ten per cent salary cut is
recommended as the only method
of bringing salary expense in line
with the present reduced sales. It
! is believed that this can be done
without the present reduced sales.
It is believed that this can be done
i without jeopardizing the scale of
living of the employees. It should
be noticed that a ten per cent cut
! has already been effected by put
-1 ting the employees on a five-day
j week, effecting a saving of $2,600.
The further reduction will result
in an added yearly saving of $2,500.
2. It is recommended that no in
j crease in bonuses be made unless
I the business improves substantially.
' The bonus should be retained, how
) ever, to provide an incentive to the
j employees.
The committee feels that the
staff of the Bookstore be reduced
by two employees. It is our recom
mendation that one member of the
office force should be eliminated.
One member of the sales force
should also be discharged. The
burden of the discharge of the
latter employee can best be borne
by the stationery and textbook de
i partments, The estimated savings
from this policy arc approximately
$2,200 yearly.
4. It is recommended that the stock
iof the stationery department be
checked in order to revise the pur
chase limits and to reduce the vh
; riety of type of items in each line.
It was found that in the line of
j stickers that a seven years' supply
have been purchased. This can be
! prevented by reducing the number
of lines securing a faster turnover
i of the lines which arc carried.
5. Mark-down records should be
kept in all departments instead of in
merely one department (Text Book)
| as in the past. It is felt that this
would result in decreased losses from
holding stock on the shelves too long
j a period.
(>. It is recommended that a
j carefully conceived advertising
policy be adopted in order to in
crease sales in competitive items
and to inform the students of new
or little known lines. This would
apply particularly to items in the
general book, typewriter, and sta
tionery departments.
7. Student help: With the use of
! student help in the store it would be
possible to create approximately six
jobs for students. However, student
help has on the whole proved to be
unsatisfactory and the committee
does not feel that the campus would
be satisfied with the inferior service
which experience tells us would re
sult.
8. It i.s recommended that the
present plan of store departmentali
zation be retained. Though a non
departmentalized set-up would re
quire fewer employees and would
thus be less costly, past experience
has shown that the student body
would not be satisfied with the
slower service which would result.
CONCLUSION: The committee
wishes to express its sincere ap
preciation to the Bookstore Man
ager, Mr. Staeger, and the general
staff for their whole-hearted co
operation with the committee in
conducting this investigation.
Without that co-operation, the in
vestigation would have been im
measurably handicapped.
The student body should realize
that the successful operation ol the
Bookstore depends largely upon stu
dent co-operation and patronage.

A (en per cent salary cut and a reduction in personnel from 14 to 12. A
carefully conceived advertising policy to increase sales. A few minor im
provements in methods of handling stock.
With these as its major recommendations, the Bookstore Committee came
out of a three-month seclusion among bookstore facts, figures, and argu
ment yesterday afternoon to show operators of the store how they can
save students $1700 yearly without noticeably impairing the quality of
service.
Added to the $2600 lopped off the yearly expenses by the store manage
ment with cuts that went into effect February first, two weeks after the
committee began work, the total yearly saving brought about since the
—— Daily first advocated an investiga-

j tion would amount to $7300, or more
than twice the figure paid out in
' rebates last year.
The directors of the Bookstore
are under no technical obligation
to follow (lie recommendations of
the committee, since the Associated
Students have no hand in the
operation of the store.
The report follows:
After a thorough investigation of
the Stanford Bookstore, the commit
tee, appointed by the Student Body
! President, Bill Corbus, submits the
following recommendations:
1. A ten per cent salary cut is
recommended as the only method
of bringing salary expense in line
with the present reduced sales. It
! is believed that this can be done
without the present reduced sales.
It is believed that this can be done
i without jeopardizing the scale of
living of the employees. It should
be noticed that a ten per cent cut
! has already been effected by put
-1 ting the employees on a five-day
j week, effecting a saving of $2,600.
The further reduction will result
in an added yearly saving of $2,500.
2. It is recommended that no in
j crease in bonuses be made unless
I the business improves substantially.
' The bonus should be retained, how
) ever, to provide an incentive to the
j employees.
The committee feels that the
staff of the Bookstore be reduced
by two employees. It is our recom
mendation that one member of the
office force should be eliminated.
One member of the sales force
should also be discharged. The
burden of the discharge of the
latter employee can best be borne
by the stationery and textbook de
i partments, The estimated savings
from this policy arc approximately
$2,200 yearly.
4. It is recommended that the stock
iof the stationery department be
checked in order to revise the pur
chase limits and to reduce the vh
; riety of type of items in each line.
It was found that in the line of
j stickers that a seven years' supply
have been purchased. This can be
! prevented by reducing the number
of lines securing a faster turnover
i of the lines which arc carried.
5. Mark-down records should be
kept in all departments instead of in
merely one department (Text Book)
| as in the past. It is felt that this
would result in decreased losses from
holding stock on the shelves too long
j a period.
(>. It is recommended that a
j carefully conceived advertising
policy be adopted in order to in
crease sales in competitive items
and to inform the students of new
or little known lines. This would
apply particularly to items in the
general book, typewriter, and sta
tionery departments.
7. Student help: With the use of
! student help in the store it would be
possible to create approximately six
jobs for students. However, student
help has on the whole proved to be
unsatisfactory and the committee
does not feel that the campus would
be satisfied with the inferior service
which experience tells us would re
sult.
8. It i.s recommended that the
present plan of store departmentali
zation be retained. Though a non
departmentalized set-up would re
quire fewer employees and would
thus be less costly, past experience
has shown that the student body
would not be satisfied with the
slower service which would result.
CONCLUSION: The committee
wishes to express its sincere ap
preciation to the Bookstore Man
ager, Mr. Staeger, and the general
staff for their whole-hearted co
operation with the committee in
conducting this investigation.
Without that co-operation, the in
vestigation would have been im
measurably handicapped.

that the successful operation ol the
Bookstore depends largely upon stu
dent co-operation and patronage.
