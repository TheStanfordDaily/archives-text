# A 						job Completed and Well Done— The Bookstore Investigating Committee Reports
## 
### 
Today's report of the Bookstore investigation cornmil
lee is neither startling nor stupid. In short, it is what every
good report endeavors to he comprehensive, outspoken,
and aeciirale. Ihe eoniniiltee struck ;»t the actual root of
all the Bookstore's financial dillicnlties. over-organization,
recommending salary cuts and reduction of the force em
ployed in the store.
Apparently the investigating committee hit the nail on
the head, for it is a matter of no small significance that
salaries in the Bookstore were cut ten per cent between the
lime that the Daii.y began agitating for an investigation
and today's publication of the committee's findings.
It will be interesting to note what action is taken on the
committee's recommendations. The committee, composed
of undergraduate and business school students, went about
its work seriously and patiently, taking caution to make
no hasty judgment or ill-advised surest ion. The Book
store Committee has pointed out ways by which the store
may he operated more eflicicntly and economically.
The Associated Students, operating' through their Rx
ecutive Committee, cannot logically forgot about the Book
store now that the report of the investigating eoniniiltee
has been made public. The committee has pointed the way.
Xovv action should he taken toward putting the recom
mendations into practice, if the Bookstore is to operate,
as it is intended, as a co-operative unit on the campus.
