# A
						Plea for One of the Last of Stanford's Democratic Traditions
## 
### 
(lone arc many of Stanford's Iradiitons, gone lo de
served oblivion. The artificial and meaningless have
passed, together with those left behind bv what social his
torinns call the inevitable march of time.
Their death from attenuation has been unmourned, ex
cept by sentimental anti(piarians. Traditions rise and de
cline only by natural forces, and the unworthy cannot
escape elimination.
Of all the early traditions of the Farm, the most valu
able is that of democracy, democracy of spirit and of ac
tion. It is the only important heritage of the founders, and
though hard hit by developments of the last twenty years,
remains an integral part of the social plexus of the campus.
Stanford's democracy has been rightly praised. Hut
periodically it slips into desuetude, and a little jacking-up
is needed. According to those who spend what is probably
valuable time wailing every day at both the foot and head
of Palm Drive for a lift to and from the campus it is
needed now.
Perhaps it is only freshmen and the gentlemen from the
junior colleges who need to be reminded that it is one of
Ihe t Diversity's most time-honored obligations for students
with cars lo offer rides to those who would otherwise walk.
Older students recognize this as one of Ihe inalienable
factors of campus democracy.
If this custom be passing, then the spirit of Stanford
democracy is truly on its way to Ihe junk-pile, to be classed
finally with the worthless traditions preceding it there.
