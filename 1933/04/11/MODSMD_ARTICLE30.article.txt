# Local Registration as Solution of Restriction on Students of Voting Age
## 
### 
We live in a country which is suposed to he the world's
finest example of a democracy. The government is run,
we are told, not only for the people hut bv all the people.
On the whole these fads arc true.
The tinted Stales was one of the ty-st to adopt woman
suffrage and has never placed any great restrictions on tin 4
light to vote. The government is run almost completely,
if not ably, hy the masses.
There remains, however, at least one large hody of men
and women who are deprived of the right to vote by an
antiquated law. A large majority of the university students
ol America are in attendance at schools removed from
their legal residences and consequently arc unahle to vote.
Easily half of these students are of voting age and
democratic justice would seem to demand thai they he
allowed a voice in governmental alVairs, local and national.
Our republican type of state depends forjits success largely
on mass education. Yet here is a group, supposedly edu
cated to the limit, which is unahle to make use of its learn
ing in political improvement.
The solution of the problem is, of course, local regis
tration. This would necessitate the passage of new laws,
lull, if there be any truth in the theory that mass education
is the basis of good government in a democracy, such laws
should certainly be enacted at the first opportunity.
The Business Staff will meet at 7: 30 o'clock.
The Editorial Stall' will meet at 1 : 15 o'clock.
