# BULL SESSION
## THE 						INVESTIGATION IS OVER 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
Nov/ I know why George Jean
Nathan is willing to let the world
go to hell—reformerless and unre
formed. For the .simple reason that
reforming it is such a bother. Yet
1 the reason was not simple enough
for my comprehension before the
Investigation of the Bookstore be
gan. And the Bookstore is a rela
tively .small part of the world.
Investigation may be gallant when
conducted on a Sherlock Holme.s
style or by a Senate Investigating
Committee with a fanfare of drums,
battalions of hectic reporters, and
national figures on the witness chair.
Reading reams and reams of figures
is not the most exciting sport in the
world. Never, since I left long divi
| sion in the fourth grade, have I
j .studied so many numbers. The Busi
ness graduates on the committee, of
course, had even more fun in this
I regard.
Now that it is all over, what?
Some students will be sure the com
j mittee members must have received
typewriters, fountain pens, and an
ink annuity for life for holding out
the dynamite. This is untrue —un-
fortunately. Others will feel that the
Committee has gone bolshevistic
with it bang. Both these reactions
must be accepted with the lowering
of Lagunita as irresistible natural
forces.

i ; What makes me wake up at night
and cry out with all my investigating
soul is the knowledge that most of
the students will probably say:
"Saving of $7,300—we11, what about
it?" Of this total, $4,700 is recom
mended by the committee and an
other $2,(500 was put into effect since
the Daily asked, for an investigation.
Of course $7,1500 will not balance
the budget or buy Radio City from
the Rockefellers, though they would
probably be plenty glad to sell out
at a price not too much over that
figure. But $7,300 is twice the re
bates that were given last year. For
every dollar that was given out last
year—when these savings have all
been realized, the student should
gather three. That is enough to buy
a dozen quarts of beer. That should
have some power with the students
— the beer and the savings.
Further, the Committee made
other recommendations whose bene
ficial results it is not possible to
measure accurately at this time. That
(hey will mean added dollars to the
students, if administered sympa
thetically, is certain.
1 Of course the Board of Directors
of the Bookstore has yet to accept
these recommendations. If they balk
at such a moderate report, then the
campus can in all honesty say:
"What's the use?"

measure accurately at this time. That
(hey will mean added dollars to the
students, if administered sympa
thetically, is certain.
1 Of course the Board of Directors
of the Bookstore has yet to accept
these recommendations. If they balk
at such a moderate report, then the
campus can in all honesty say:
"What's the use?"
Nov/ I know why George Jean
Nathan is willing to let the world
go to hell—reformerless and unre
formed. For the .simple reason that
reforming it is such a bother. Yet
1 the reason was not simple enough
for my comprehension before the
Investigation of the Bookstore be
gan. And the Bookstore is a rela
tively .small part of the world.
Investigation may be gallant when
conducted on a Sherlock Holme.s
style or by a Senate Investigating
Committee with a fanfare of drums,
battalions of hectic reporters, and
national figures on the witness chair.
Reading reams and reams of figures
is not the most exciting sport in the
world. Never, since I left long divi
| sion in the fourth grade, have I
j .studied so many numbers. The Busi
ness graduates on the committee, of
course, had even more fun in this
I regard.
Now that it is all over, what?
Some students will be sure the com
j mittee members must have received
typewriters, fountain pens, and an
ink annuity for life for holding out
the dynamite. This is untrue —un-
fortunately. Others will feel that the
Committee has gone bolshevistic
with it bang. Both these reactions
must be accepted with the lowering
of Lagunita as irresistible natural
forces.

i ; What makes me wake up at night
and cry out with all my investigating
soul is the knowledge that most of
the students will probably say:
"Saving of $7,300—we11, what about
it?" Of this total, $4,700 is recom
mended by the committee and an
other $2,(500 was put into effect since
the Daily asked, for an investigation.
Of course $7,1500 will not balance
the budget or buy Radio City from
the Rockefellers, though they would
probably be plenty glad to sell out
at a price not too much over that
figure. But $7,300 is twice the re
bates that were given last year. For
every dollar that was given out last
year—when these savings have all
been realized, the student should
gather three. That is enough to buy
a dozen quarts of beer. That should
have some power with the students
— the beer and the savings.
Further, the Committee made
other recommendations whose bene
ficial results it is not possible to
measure accurately at this time. That
(hey will mean added dollars to the
students, if administered sympa
thetically, is certain.
