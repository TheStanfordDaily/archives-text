MAEDCHEN IN UNIFORM (U.E.A.)
—Al (he Stanford Theatre.
Difficult to evaluate despite, or
perhaps because of, the superlatives
of two continents, this film is cer
tainly one of the most genuinely
artistic to cross the screen in a long
time. Difficult to evaluate, because it
is totally different from anything
made in this country—indeed, it
could not have been made in this
country; artistic because of the sim
plicity of tho story, its sincere treat
ment, and the intelligent work of
the performers.
Against the background of a Ger
man girls' school dedicated to the
Prussian military ideal is told the
story of Manuela, a sensitive and
loving child unable to adjust herself
to the rigid and impersonal code of
the school. She finds a measure of
sympathy in one of the teachers, the
handsome Fraulein von Bernburg,
for whom she conceives an ado
lescent adoration.
The film is episodic, but the epi
sodes are well co-ordinated by the
director, Leontine Sagan, in her use
of the school as a background; so
natural is this that one has the sense
of viewing actual routine. Simple in
the extreme, the film is a sincere
and compelling one which moves
with magnetic artistry toward the
attempted suicide at the close.
The dialogue, ot course, is in Ger
man, but with the aid of extremely
lucid English titles, the whole of the

story is retained.
Naturalness is the keynote of the
performance of Hertha Thiele as
Manuela, and she captures all the
tenderness and all the impulsiveness
of the adolescent girl, particularly in
her pantomime.
Dorothea Wieck matches her own
rare beauty with a beautiful imper
sonation of the teacher, giving it a
fine shading between impartiality
and sympathy, always with restraint.
The Principal, with her creaking
shoes and tapping cane, is forcefully
interpreted by Emilia Unda; it is a
difficult role made strikingly real.
