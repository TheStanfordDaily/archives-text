"We Want Buchanan—
for California"

I am wandering around this here
Farm, looking about ;is glum a.s one
of them Pay-Two-Bits As-You-En
ter Pee-Wee golf courses that still
flutter up Hollywood and that was
built in the big corner lot boom in
that burg a couple of years ago, when
1 ups and runs into Howie Moore.
Seeing as bow I h;is been searching
among 1 ht; dreg behind the Phi Delt
house and the old exes in the rack
in I lie Econ corridors for something
to (ill this column with, I is of course
happy to see Howie and glad-hands
him for some seconds.
"Gimme an idea for 'Slants,' you
mugg," 1 greets him, and he an
swers in his polite monosyllabic
way:
"Sure. Baseball."
At that, my nose for news begin.;
itching and I takes out my hand
kerchief to dry it, when Abe Mel
linkoff pipes up, "Aw, they ought
to give the ball team numerals. Give
all athletes' numerals. No, give
everyone a Block 'S'; A Block 'S'
with every Registration Book." That
sounds like a good caption for 'Bull
Se.'ision'; you can't have it, Dick."
So I is disappointed again, since
1 only has two hours in which to
(ill this space and a Accounting Ex
Tuesday, when Stew Crawford
sticks out his beagle. Stew is re
writing my swell basketball yarns
so ho can get a free "Quad," and he I
says:
"To hell with baseball. Football is
the most spectacular sport. It is the j
only sport. To hell with baseball— j
do you know where a guy can get ;
beer wholesale?"
Moore starts to say that baseball \
is the only sport where you can i
really enjoy peanuts and Mellinkoff ;
says that basketball is the only sport
where you can enjoy peanuts and >
Crawford, savs, hell, you can enjoy j
peanuts at a football game, so I j
leaves their contaminating presence |
and strolls up to the Journalism De- j
partment.
There I finds Ilarry Starke, who I
i; somewhat of a pitcher and also ,
somewhat of a writer, and he slips ,
me the low-down on this Conference I
ball race. From what I is able to
distinguish, it appears that Stanford |
must win from both S.C. and Cal j
and that Cal must lose to S.C. if
these Indians of ours is to be even j
co-champions.
Then Harry, turning over the j
pages of the comic section of the
Sunday Examiner, says that it all j
depends on a fellow named George j
Lefty Buchanan down Southern j
California way. I is plenty irked by i
that since how could anything de
pend on a southpaw?
II seems that this Buchanan is !
(he S.C. ball captain, and about the |
handiest pitcher in college ball, and i
that he can beat Cal and maybe j
can beat our Indians. We play S.C. !
on Friday and Cal on Saturday, and j
S.C. plays Cal on Wednesday, so it is
clear that Buchanan is our Problem j
Child at present.
Now of course I has not consulted j
the B.A.C. or the A.S.S.U. or the I
Board of Trustees, but something
must be done abovit this Buchanan. !
And, of course, no Stanford man J
would ask a favor of S.C., but be- |
cause of my undying love for my !
alma mater, 1 would be willing to j
compromise myself to the extent of j
re questing Sam Barry that he scri- '
ously consider pitching Buchanan j
against Cal so that, in the interests |
of good, clean amateur sport the j
Pacific Coast Conference baseball j
race ends in a tie and everyone is \
happy until the play-off.
