# Bear Cubs Show Strength In Six Track Events
## ED VALLEJO TOPS SPRINTING GROUP WITH 9.9 RECORD 
### Oliver Johnston 
Strong in the sprints, 880, javelin,
and pole vault, California's freshman
I tracksters go into the last week of
1 preparation for the Little Big Meet
j which will be held on Angell Field
i Friday afternoon. Stanford is a heavy
. ! favorite to win.
Fastest, though least consistent,
of the Bear sprinters, Ed Vallejo
headlines an array of daslunen
i that puts any other California
freshman sprint team of recent
years to shame. Vallejo ran !>.!)
seconds in helping trounce the
Alameda All-Stars. lie hit the tape
two feet ahead of his teammates,
Ilurst and Dick, who were each
! clocked in ten seconds Hat.
I Vallejo is too short to run the 220,
j but I lurst and Dick carry on ably,
i Both men are consistent at twenty -
1 two and one-filth seconds. When
| faced with Stanford's Graysons,
! Bronsteins, Reisners, and Klop
stocks, they may shade even time.
Undefeated in collegiate competi
tion, Captain Dick Brace has showed
| his heels to many classy half-milers
â€”not Ihe least of these is Bob Rey
nolds, the best Bear varsity 880
! star. Brace has gone under two min
| utes flat in almost every meet,
matching the astounding perform
i ances of Stanford's ace, Chuck
Nimmo.
Gainor and Packwood are the
best California hurdlers, hut they
i don't skim the timbers with the
speed and alacrity of Indians Hunt
j Kingsbury and Sam Klopstock.
Gainor's best time for the highs is
15.5 seconds; lie has streaked a
flight of lows in 25 seconds flat.
| Comparative performances show
him about two yards slower than
I the Stanford runners in both races.
A two-yard advantage is hardly a
I safe margin in the hectic competi
tion which the Little Big Meet al
' ways affords.
California has a very definite edge
I over the Papooses in the pole vault.
Haskell's 12 feet, 8 inches betters the
j best efforts of Indian vaulters by
I several inches.
Team strength, however, appears ,
! to be secure on this side of the bay.
A conservative dope sheet gives
Stanford more than enough points
to win.
