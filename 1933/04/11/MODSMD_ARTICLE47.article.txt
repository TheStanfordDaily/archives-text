# DELMAS HITS .636 TO SET SLUGGING PACE FOR LEAGUE
## 
### 
Retaining their hold on the batting
championship, if not garnering the
pennant, Stanford's hitters lead all
California collegiate batters with
Bert Delmas firmly entrenched in
first position.
Including all league games played
up until last Saturday, the Indian
shortstop has hammered out 11
sale hits in 22 attempts for an
average of .<»;»(>, over 100 points
ahead of Ernie Ilolbrook of U.S.C.,
, his nearest rival for the batting
crown.
Four Indians are listed among the
first ten hitters in the league, with
Diek Miles tied for third with Kyle
of California with an average of .422,
Livermore in seventh place, .',K>3, and
Ladue in ninth place, .357. If Delmas
retains his leading position, he will
duplicate the performance of Vince
Phiilipi of Stanford, who won the
crown last season.
California seems to have a death
grip on first place with a tie being
the worst that can happen to her
championship hopes. Stanford is in
second place, two full games behind
the Bears, and can tie for first only
by defeating U.S.C. here Friday and
then drubbing California at Berkeley
Saturday, providing that the Trojans
can delcat the Bears Thursday.
The men <of Troy open their north
ern series today with a game at
Moraga against St. Mary's, meet
California at Berkeley Wednesday,
and come to the Sunken Diamond
for their engagement against Stan
ford Friday.
