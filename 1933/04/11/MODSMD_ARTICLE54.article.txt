# TROJAN RUNNERS TAKE OFF WRAPS, SET NEW MARKS
## 
### 
With the Stanford-Southern Culi- !
fornia meet only eleven days off, j
Coach Dean Cromwell has finally
removed the cloak of mystery which ■
annually guards the early season j
performances of his trackmen. In !
February of every year the Trojans
haven't a ghost of a chance; in July j
they are 1.C.4-A. champions with
men approaching world records in ;
nearly every event.
The annual U.S.C. mystery squad j
.showed much-improved records I
against the All-Stars last Saturday, j
Al California, however, Coach Brutus I
Hamilton does not yet seem to have j
acquired the cloak-removing knack, j
Coe Excellent
Only the excellent time of little j
Dick Coe in the low hurdles against i
the Southern California Junior Col- I
I
lege All-Stars had any effect on the
Big Meet dope sheets which have
been fermenting in track-minded
Indians and Bears for the last few
months.
At Southern California, Charlie
Parsons Jr. became the newest and
greatest thorn in Stanford's side
when he stepped off times of 9.7 and
21.2 seconds for the 100- and 220- ;
yard races. These times, the fastest
made anywhere in the country this
year, indicate that Abe Hables and
Frank Lombardi will have to be
satisfied with place points in the
two sprints.
Blackmail Promises
Performances by California and j
U.S.C. quarter-milers indicate that !
Al Blackmail will have an excellent ;
chance of emerging from his next ,
two races unscathed. Ed Ablowich, I
U.S.C.'s Olympic veteran, continued ;
to run in mediocre fashion. He won
in 49 flat last Saturday, no better I
than Blackmail's time of 50.2 sec- I
onds for a quarter mile, the first j
.'3OO yards of which were run against
a strong wind.
