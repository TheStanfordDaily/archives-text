# MANY EXPERIENCED VETERANS APPEAR ON SOCCER FIELD
## 
### 
First day of spring soccer practice
| brought out 34 of the 38 players
i aspiring to places on next season's
I varsity. Veterans from last year's
i varsity with their numerals—eleven
| with circle-letters—and the rest ex-

.perienced men from the frosii and
second strings of 1932.
Starting the first palmy days'
practices with workouts, Coach
Harry Maloney sliced the unusually
large turnout into three squads and
set them a'scrimmaging twenty
apiece.
If any judgments can be made
from the first scrimmages, the half
back position is going to be power
ful jiiext seai'pn. Four lettermen,
Doug Kennedy, Johnny Hitchcock,
Dick Strouse, and Waddy White;
one frosh star, Miguel Gomez; and
Rod Lewis, who missed his letter
due to injuries, comprise the pleas
ing propects for the three openings.
Kennedy was outstanding in yes
terday's show, having cai'ried over
good condition and skill from rugby.
More experienced men fill out the
number of halfback competitors,
Ralph Cotter, Dave Dunning, and
Ruddy Gonzales among them.
The forward line has five letter
men, Gaston Rojas, Stan Moy, Carl
Knecht, Charley Emmerick, and Cy
Johnson, and other veterans in lesser
numbers strutting their stuff lor the
five forward berths. "
Jack King and Milt Newman, both
consistent varsity goalies of last sea
son, place that position in safe hands,
with other players out to develop
into goal guards.
As yet only Assistant Coach Bus
ter Holmes, ex-Captain Carl Brek
elbaum, and ex-frosh player Henry
Valentine are out for the two full
back places. Nif Branch, letterman
of that position, will be turning out
next fall, adding some strength to
the team at that spot.
