### Francis Hamilton 
Les Hables dashed off a 9.8 bun
died and a 22 flat furlong in time
trials on Angell Field yesterday and
then retired to the wrapping count -
ir, as Coach Dink Templeton sug
gested, "to be stamped 'Handle with
Care' and wrapped in cellophane un
til Saturday."
Other members of the varsity
track squad look light workouts,
and. prepared to taper ofT for Satur
day's Big Meet.
Relay Men
Sam Eastman, who will work with
the combination of A1 and Don
Blackmail and Frank Fullenwider
in the relay team, ran 51.2 seconds
quarter. Cotto Herbert knocked over
his customary quota of hurdles and
called it a day.
Herbert will have the large as
signment Saturday of cutting off
Dick Coe of California from a first
place in the low hurdle event. The
two men are evenly matched, and
have both stepped 23.8 for the dis
tance. There i.s a slim chance that
the present Big Meet record of 23.3
may be dipped in the duel.
Marks Safe
Most Big Meet marks will securely
withstand the record-breaking at
tack, though. Ojily one, the pole
vault height set at 13 feet 8 7 s inches
by Pool in last year's meet appears
certain to be eclipsed. Bud Deacon
and Bill Miller of the Cardinals have
been hovering around the 14-foot
stage all seaosn and stand a chance
of bettering that in California com
pel it ion.
George Gray, recently suffering
from a muscle injury, took a light
practice yesterday and will compete
Saturday, thus completing the Stan
ford quartet of weightmen. Lyman,
Gray, Laborde, or Dunn may get
off a good heave and put Harlow
Rothert's meet record of 51 ' feet
10% inches in the discard.
