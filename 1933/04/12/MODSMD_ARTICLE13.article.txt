# Old Carbon Mountain Goes On Rampage Again
## 
### 
DURANGO, Colo., April 11 U\>)â€”
Chickens squawked, dogs bayed, and
livestock bellowed at dawn today
because of something more than the
rising son.
Old Carbon mountain, Colorado's
restless peak that gets up and walks
around like an earthquake, went on
the rampage again.
Persons living within two or three
miles of the disintegrating moun
tain were awakened by the rum
blings and crashing avalanches, and
dressed hurriedly to see old Car
bon's newest performance.
