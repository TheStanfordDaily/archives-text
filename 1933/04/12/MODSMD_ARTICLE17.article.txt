# Pretzel Business Booms When 3.2 Beer Returns
## 
### B. KELLOGG 
Quietly and without the bray of
I ballyhoo that heralded the return
| of beer, the pretzel has come into
| its own once more to share the
spotlight focused on three-point
two.
Although virtually synonymous
with the word beer, the lowly little
I pretzel failed to disappear when the
I nation went, dry 13 years ago. It
i remained on the market and has
j since grown into a semi-household
product. Once the caviar to beer
drinker only, the pretzel is now a
tasty accessory to any "tea p;irty."
New Shapes Appear
I With the salty tidbit domesticated,
! producers were forced to develop a
j variety of types to suit individual
, personalities. A dozen or so new
! shapes have made their appearance.
Beer connoisseurs know the fol
lowing: the "twiglet," a small straight
' pretzel; the "fish," a fish-shaped
I biscuit in two sizes; the "alphabet,
star, and "moon" pretzels, shaped to
; designate their namesakes; the
I "hazelnut," a miniature just big
enough for a mouthful; and the

"Tiny Tim," the small pretzel with
the twist.
As President Roosevelt's an
nouncemcnt of April beer was
flashed across the United States i
pretzel companies stoked up their
furnaces and began a mad dash to
fill rush orders.
Huge Daily Output
A Chicago plant announced a daily
output of 3,500,000 pretzels with
orders a week old piling up. Cleve
land's largest plant, working on a
double shift, issued reports of not
being able to produce fast enough.
Company officials said they usually
had hundreds of cans of pretzels in j
stock but that now their stock had j
disappeared. In St. Louis one con- !
cern is worked on a 24-hour shift to j
send out 10 tons of pretzels a day, !
orders two months behind.
And through all of this the pret
zel-bender has remained unsung and
all but forgotten. To be an expert
twister at least six months' actual
experience is necessary, but at the
end of this practice period he will
be able to turn out pretzels on the
average of more than one a second.
