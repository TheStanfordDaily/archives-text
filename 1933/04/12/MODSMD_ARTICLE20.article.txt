### 
WASHINGTON, April 11 (/P) -
Clarion demands for currency ex
pansion to float the farmer out of
the bog of his low price troubles
pounded in both House and Senate
today as the Administration Agricul
tural Relief program stumbled along
its path.
Evidence of a widening breach
between the White House and some
Democratic Senators appeared on
the Senate floor in reiteration by
Chairman Smith of the agriculture
committee of hostility toward some
sections of the Roosevelt Farm Aid
plan.
