# Weight Rule Arouses Ire Of Ex-Queen
## Costumes Are Shown In Cellar And Bookstore 
### 
Responding violently to the pro
] posed specifications for a 150-pound
i Masque Ball queen thi.s year, Marion
j Hewlett sent the following letter to
| the Daily last night:
| The Editor, Sir:
j Allow me to score the ridiculous
efforts on the part of a few persons
on this campus who are trying to
j "rebuild the nation -1 with "pioneer
j women."
I don't .suppose a certain person
would like it generally known
that he was bribed by a big San
Francisco corset manufacturer to
popularize the bigger type of girl.
I know this to be a fact and cer
tainly regard it as cheap sports
manship to crucify Stanford wo
men before the nation merely for
his own enrichment. Such promo
tion of private interest is not com
patible with the honest spirit for
which Stanford is renowned.
Must Queen Be Hippo?
My great-grandmother was a pio
j neer but she didn't find it necessary
to weigh 150 pounds in order to run
the biggest hop ranch in Shasta
1 county, shoot 17 Indians ,and Chris
: tianize all the rest in the county in
! one fell swoop.
j And may I address myself to the
rest of our sex on this campus. Is a
! girl to be only good enough for
Queen who resembles a young
"hippo"? Let's show these "rebuild
j ers Friday.
Very truly yours,
Marion Hewlett
Masque Ball Queen, 1932
Royal Wcighing-in
Not in the least perturbed by
; these remarks, King Contest officials
went right ahead and announced that
Friday morning an officially-tested
scale will be set up beside the voting
blackboard. All candidates for the
j post of Queen must be publicly
weighed in, it was declared.
Meanwhile, Pi Beta Phi unoffi
cially revealed that the house near
the top of the Row is working
night and day to whip Mary Delia
Callahan around into shape so that
I she can meet the 135-pound limit
by Friday. "Rich foods will do it,"
exclaimed a prominent member of
| the sorority.
Starting this morning, sample cos
, tumes for the affair will be displayed
by Herb Sanderson and Marty
Krupp in the Union Cellar and in
| the Bookstore. Orders will be taken
j from thi.s time on, and all disguises
I arc quoted at very reasonable rates.
