# Palo Alto City Fathers Faced with Beer Question at Last
## 
### 
Husincss men arc business men, llie world over. And
so are politicians, hut nol such good ones as a rule. Palo;
Allo's business men have broken their silence. They want
beer. They want beer to be sold legally in their town. They ,
want their town to feel the refreshing breezes of returning]
prosperity which the legalization of .'{.2 per cent beer has'
waited into the atmosphere of other (ioldcn State cities.
What do the city fathers of I'alo Alto want ? Naturally j
they waul their town to he prosperous, but do they want
beer? Of course tliev want their citizens to shop in Palo
Alto, but are they willing to sacrifice the moral well-being
ol their citizenry for llie thousands of dollars of legal rcve- i
jitie which the sale of beer would bring? That remains to
be seen.
I he city fathers of Palo Alto are in somewhat of a tough
spot. A group of representative merchants have asked fori
beer, and their demands must be given ear, and rejected;
diplomatically, if they arc to be rejected at all. On the!
other hand, Palo Alio is a reputedly dry town. That is, on i
Ihc last occasion that the city fathers heard the voting citi-J
zens express themselves the town was dry.
The city fathers will have to gamble more or less on j
the proposition of whether or not Palo Alto is dry today in j
dealing with the merchants' petition for beer. Certainly!
the merchants believe that a few bottles of beer might be j
sold in the town or tliev would nol petition for the legali-j
zalion of its sale.
The drinking of beer, since last Thursday night, hasj
become distinctly an individual or family matter. As]
pointed out the other day in the Hull Session, the only sin
connected with beer, if such an attitude still exists, is in I
drinking the beverage, not in selling it. In view of the fact
that its citizens are free to drink beer now, it is doubtful
if even so refined and conservative a community as Palo
Alto can afford to turn down the revenue which the legal-1
ized sale of the beverage promises.
