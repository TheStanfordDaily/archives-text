# Who Said Horrid Word? "Collegiana" Gets Gate Receipts
## 
### 
"(lollegiana," a word spoken with a slur of the tongue
a curl of the lip in these parts, may nevertheless he a
term with a beautifully significant meaning. Thai fact is
being demonstrated these days by the t'niversity of South
ern California, which has sent its nationally famous hand I
and glee club out upon a lour of the Pacific ('oast cities.
Deprecating remarks anenl Trojan student "collegia!-â€¢
ism" have been the rule among Stanford men for so long
that any editorial comment which condones a public deni-1
onstration of the "botcha" in college life is certain to be!
noted with something of shock.
Some of the publicity-seeking stunts which have been j
pulled off by S.C. students, dance committee chairmen |
notably, have smacked of the junior collegiate very strong
ly, and for that reason have been made targets for the
cynically superior jibing of these columns. The stunts
have, in the main, been successful in attaining widespread
newspaper publicity hence the jibing.
Hut when the "hotcha" spirit is directed into channels
not only notice-gaining but financially remunerative, that's
something else again. In days like the present sunrise and
sunset succession, not even the best of universities can
afford to overlook any legitimate and passingly dignified
method of advertisement which may help swell registra
tion totals. Not even though such advertisement may em
phasize the athletic or social advantages of the university
i ather than the academic.
The Trojan institution is smart in realizing that it has
a attraction which people are willing to pay
for, and in giving them the actual opportunity to pay for it.
