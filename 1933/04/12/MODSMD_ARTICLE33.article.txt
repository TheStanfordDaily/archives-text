## MOVIE MADNESS 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
Those of us who boo local movie
j failures are again under fire. So
| long and continuous has been this
| fire, that toasted to a crisp should
| describe our present condition. A lit
| tie fire stimulates activity and is
I blessed for that reason. I do not
j hesitate to admit, however, that by
j this time the heat is unpleasant.
It would cause rne, for one, to
I call a halt, were I engaging in this
| practice for the fun or publicity.
I Publicity there is none because the
' show-house is so dark that none
can see me. The fun is slight at first,
but 'afterwards degenerates into
pure routine and labor. Yet, I con
tinue in my booing out of duty—
service to mankind.
It is very easy to see how long
winded speeches full of references
to the whites of the red-coats' eyes
i is a service to the people. But what
| aid is booing? Booing is the only
j way that the intelligent minority
| can make itself felt on the Holly
! wood moguls who produce the films.
II use the phrase "intelligent minor
ity" advisedly—under the well
known assumption that every mi
! nority which cannot have the dis
! tinction of being called the majority,
! can appropriate the adjective—"in
| telligent."
I
i How are the movie people to know
j that the stuff they are pushing out
! is horrible? The Gandhi method
| would be to stay away from the
1 shows in silent protest. But the mo
| gills would be glad to have the few
quarters slay away 90 that the great
herd could sit in ignorance and be
! satisfied with whatever was flicked

upon the screen. No, the minority
must come and prove by their boo
ing, beyond u shadow of a doubt,
that the picture is clearly the worst
ever.
Booing is contagious and, once
started, spreads with the avidity of
influenza. Yet it strengthens the
critical faculties of the mob beyond
all recognition. Where before they
sat like sticks—now they sit and
shout like critics. The transformation
bodes well for the future of the
screen. The theatre owners will
communicate their woe to the pro
ducers. The producers will change
the woe into better pictures. That is
the only hope.
It is claimed that booing disturbs
those who enjoy the picture. How
about the liberated housewife who
persists in complimenting the pic
ture throughout—"Ain't Janet Gay
nor sweet —so kind like? Yes, that's
Ronald Colman —Sure, I'm sure; he
wore the cutest mustache in 'Bull
dog Drummond.'" That irritates me
clearly as much as my booing an
noys her. Yet, no one would suggest
1 muzzling her, because she is com
plimenting. And about hie moronic
mob that claps at the drop of the
hat. Every peal of unbased applause
is a knife-thrust.
This spring vacation, I was
trapped in a terrible picture entitled
"Pai'ole Girl." I began clapping the
j melodramatic heights to which the
picture screamed. The audience was
; soon with me. There is hope for
America. Of course booing for no
other purpose than to create a scene
is inexcusable. That rarely occurs—
•especially in Palo Alto.

shout like critics. The transformation
bodes well for the future of the
screen. The theatre owners will
communicate their woe to the pro

the woe into better pictures. That is
the only hope.
It is claimed that booing disturbs
those who enjoy the picture. How
about the liberated housewife who
persists in complimenting the pic
ture throughout—"Ain't Janet Gay
nor sweet —so kind like? Yes, that's
Ronald Colman —Sure, I'm sure; he
wore the cutest mustache in 'Bull
dog Drummond.'" That irritates me
clearly as much as my booing an
noys her. Yet, no one would suggest
1 muzzling her, because she is com
plimenting. And about hie moronic
mob that claps at the drop of the
hat. Every peal of unbased applause
is a knife-thrust.
This spring vacation, I was
trapped in a terrible picture entitled
"Pai'ole Girl." I began clapping the
j melodramatic heights to which the
picture screamed. The audience was
; soon with me. There is hope for
America. Of course booing for no
other purpose than to create a scene
is inexcusable. That rarely occurs—
•especially in Palo Alto.
Those of us who boo local movie
j failures are again under fire. So

service to mankind.
It is very easy to see how long
winded speeches full of references

Booing is contagious and, once
