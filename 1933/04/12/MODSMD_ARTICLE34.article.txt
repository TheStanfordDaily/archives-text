WHISTLING IN THE DARK and
TWENTY THOUSAND YEARS IN
SING SING—At the Varsity.
"Whistling in the Dark" is an un
assuming, ingenious little thriller. lis
amusement is based almost entirely
upon the humor inherent in the in
congruous. Diminutive Ernest Truex,
well known in New York but new
to the screen, has been surrounded
by a cast which towers over him.
His sincerest protestations, therefore,
sound like squeaks and he gives the
impression of being nothing quite so
much as an agitated chipmunk.
But the humor in the film is not
sustained. There are a good many
slow spots, faintly amusing but not
sufficiently so to warrant their # pro
longed extension. It is not a good
film but it has the virtue of being
different. The incongruity lends to
the film a consistently but too slimly
amusing tone.
''Twenty Thousand Years in Sing
Sing" is negligible melodrama. It
has been given a good cast and pro
duced expensively, but is so con
structed as to be ridiculous. Bette
Davis is charming and, since her
role is so silly, the fact that her
voice is out of tone with her in
ferred character makes no difference.
She is one of the better supporting
players of the screen. I can't imagine
in exactly what sort of tale she could
be made starring material but she
deserves an opportunity. —Sandoe
Current at the Varsity are "The
Island of Lost Souls," which, thanks
to Charles Laughton and despite its
exaggerated emphasis of the hor
rible, is a well-sustained melodrama,
and "Our Betters," screen version of
Somerset Maugham's play starring
Constance Bennett.
THE KING'S VACATION (Warner)
—Recently at the Stanford Theatre
Wide-nostrilled, wagging - jawed
George Arliss, the man of a thou
sand roles but one characterization,
combines in "The King's Vacation,'"
the cleancut executive ability of
"Disraeli, the dry humor of "The
Millionaire," the firm tenderness of
"The Man Who Played God." The
King was not old enough to dodder
like Old English.
Although Mr. Arliss is pleasant
and amusing in his sly portrayal of
Mr. Arliss, although he has a de
ceptive command of dramatic tricks,
although his sense of comedy tim
ing, tone vibration, and sentence
climax is complete, he cannot buoy
up a film without the aid of good
direction, good dialogue, and a good
supporting cast.
The script concerns the boredom
of a king and his longing for the
simple life. As a setting for Arliss'
dignified pacing, the director fur
nished palatial rooms, endless stairs,
be-medalled chests, and lifeless imi
tation of Lubitsch comedy—the hu
mor of diminutive humans and lim
itless elegance and false show. The
already widespread knowledge of
loyal heartbreak and ennui behind
royal fortitude and restraint left the
picture little to say. But I infinitely
prefer Florence Arliss* quiet reserve

dignity forced upon another queen

Ours." —Brauns

and amusing in his sly portrayal of
Mr. Arliss, although he has a de
ceptive command of dramatic tricks,
although his sense of comedy tim
ing, tone vibration, and sentence
climax is complete, he cannot buoy
up a film without the aid of good
direction, good dialogue, and a good
supporting cast.
The script concerns the boredom
of a king and his longing for the
simple life. As a setting for Arliss'
dignified pacing, the director fur
nished palatial rooms, endless stairs,
be-medalled chests, and lifeless imi
tation of Lubitsch comedy—the hu
mor of diminutive humans and lim
itless elegance and false show. The
already widespread knowledge of
loyal heartbreak and ennui behind
royal fortitude and restraint left the
picture little to say. But I infinitely
prefer Florence Arliss* quiet reserve
In the vulgar outburst and loss o)

dignity forced upon another queen

Ours." —Brauns

New York has a larger Italian
population than the capital of Italy.
WHISTLING IN THE DARK and
TWENTY THOUSAND YEARS IN
SING SING—At the Varsity.
"Whistling in the Dark" is an un
assuming, ingenious little thriller. lis
amusement is based almost entirely
upon the humor inherent in the in
congruous. Diminutive Ernest Truex,
well known in New York but new
to the screen, has been surrounded
by a cast which towers over him.
His sincerest protestations, therefore,
sound like squeaks and he gives the
impression of being nothing quite so
much as an agitated chipmunk.
But the humor in the film is not
sustained. There are a good many
slow spots, faintly amusing but not
sufficiently so to warrant their # pro
longed extension. It is not a good
film but it has the virtue of being
different. The incongruity lends to
the film a consistently but too slimly
amusing tone.
''Twenty Thousand Years in Sing
Sing" is negligible melodrama. It
has been given a good cast and pro
duced expensively, but is so con
structed as to be ridiculous. Bette
Davis is charming and, since her
role is so silly, the fact that her
voice is out of tone with her in
ferred character makes no difference.
She is one of the better supporting
players of the screen. I can't imagine
in exactly what sort of tale she could
be made starring material but she
deserves an opportunity. —Sandoe
Current at the Varsity are "The
Island of Lost Souls," which, thanks
to Charles Laughton and despite its
exaggerated emphasis of the hor
rible, is a well-sustained melodrama,

Somerset Maugham's play starring
Constance Bennett.
