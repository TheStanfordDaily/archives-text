### 
An exhibit interested in the old
missions is on display at the Art
Gallery this week.
The exhibit consists of a series of
photographs taken by H. P. Webb
of the old California missions and
Indian relics. Some of the photo
graphs are of old prints made at
the time the missions were founded.
The exhibit also includes samples of
Peruvian weaving collected by Mrs.
Grace Camp Storm, and a group of
paintings done by three different
painters, Margaret E. Rogers, Cor
Do Gouere, and Leonora N. Penni
men.
