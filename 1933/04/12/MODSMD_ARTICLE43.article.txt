Persons who are affiliated in a
teaching capacity with universities
and therefore should be experts on
the amount of knowledge filling the
craniums of the youth of the nation,
hive been making statements re
cently to the effect that those of the
youth who engage in various manly
aits of exercise are most innocently
unfamiliar with the contents, taste,
smell, color, potency, and after
effects of the new fractionated legal
liquid.
In fact, it is claimed that our col
lege athletes are not even perturbed
by the impossibility of obtaining the
fractionated liquid novV that it is
legal, although in the good, old, pre
legal or >vet days it v. as possible to
obtain all one desired and it was
not fractionated at all.
()l course the youth of our na
tion lias been instructed in the
facts of life and lias had all
Rabbit -in- thc-Cabbage-I'atch and
Stork traditions exploded at an
early age by fond mammas who
read Freud and Watson and then
never can understand why their
sons do not grow up to be Presi
dent, but slill this youth knows
nothing of even the smell of the
recent Democratic tidal wave.
Thus when one of the innocent
youth of the country is playing bas
ketball or running track or lending
bis support to his alma mater in any
one of a devious number of ways, he
is unhappily ignorant of the exist
ence of beer. But as soon as he has
graduated, with his roll of sheepskin
(for five dollars) and his box full of
m( dais (for nothing) tucked under
his aims, this youth is already magi
cally familiar with all the ins and
outs and several of the twirls of
the legal fractionated liquid, and
with the ins and twirls of several
illegal and quite dishonorable liquids
as well.
A certain famous Stanford-writer
and faculty member, whom I con
sider a friend (although I am not
nt all sure what he considers me)
..nd who is very intelligent and
therefore should know better, has
been filling the minds of the peo
ple of these parts with ideas con
cerning the naivety of the Stan
ford athletes. It seems that four
drops of beer would prove fatal to
these young future citizens, and
that the odor of old corks, wafted
from afar—say, a pasture behind
the campus—would set their teeth
rattling.
Now 1 am not one to trifle with
friendship and there is nothing I dis
like more than finding a crack in
the veneer of my beloved heroes,
but I insist that this certain famous
Stanford writer and faculty member
was having great enjoyment with
the poor minds of his not-college
learned readers. Although I can not
vouch for each and every Stanford
athlete, I am familiar enough with
these stout heroes of grid and grass
not to be at all alarmed at the pos
sibility of a few drops, of beer prov
ing fatal to them.
I have been in the city on too
many Big Game nights and in the
larger city of the South on too many
Now Year's, and I have carried too
many pals- "you're my pal and the
greatest little guy I ever knew, my
name's Joe"—upstairs and down
stairs to be taken in by this story
concerning the innocence of Stan
ford athletes. I cannot believe that
anyone could manage to attend a
university for four years and still
not be able to recognize the odor
til the legal, fractionated liquid, and
those who can believe that must be
.somewhat naive themselves.

hive been making statements re
cently to the effect that those of the
youth who engage in various manly
aits of exercise are most innocently
unfamiliar with the contents, taste,
smell, color, potency, and after
effects of the new fractionated legal
liquid.
In fact, it is claimed that our col
lege athletes are not even perturbed
by the impossibility of obtaining the
fractionated liquid novV that it is
legal, although in the good, old, pre
legal or >vet days it v. as possible to
obtain all one desired and it was
not fractionated at all.
()l course the youth of our na
tion lias been instructed in the
facts of life and lias had all
Rabbit -in- thc-Cabbage-I'atch and
Stork traditions exploded at an
early age by fond mammas who
read Freud and Watson and then
never can understand why their
sons do not grow up to be Presi
dent, but slill this youth knows
nothing of even the smell of the
recent Democratic tidal wave.
Thus when one of the innocent
youth of the country is playing bas
ketball or running track or lending
bis support to his alma mater in any
one of a devious number of ways, he
is unhappily ignorant of the exist
ence of beer. But as soon as he has
graduated, with his roll of sheepskin
(for five dollars) and his box full of
m( dais (for nothing) tucked under
his aims, this youth is already magi
cally familiar with all the ins and
outs and several of the twirls of
the legal fractionated liquid, and
with the ins and twirls of several
illegal and quite dishonorable liquids
as well.
A certain famous Stanford-writer
and faculty member, whom I con
sider a friend (although I am not
nt all sure what he considers me)
..nd who is very intelligent and
therefore should know better, has
been filling the minds of the peo
ple of these parts with ideas con
cerning the naivety of the Stan
ford athletes. It seems that four
drops of beer would prove fatal to
these young future citizens, and
that the odor of old corks, wafted
from afar—say, a pasture behind
the campus—would set their teeth
rattling.
Now 1 am not one to trifle with
friendship and there is nothing I dis
like more than finding a crack in
the veneer of my beloved heroes,
but I insist that this certain famous
Stanford writer and faculty member
was having great enjoyment with
the poor minds of his not-college
learned readers. Although I can not
vouch for each and every Stanford
athlete, I am familiar enough with
these stout heroes of grid and grass
not to be at all alarmed at the pos
sibility of a few drops, of beer prov
ing fatal to them.
I have been in the city on too
many Big Game nights and in the
larger city of the South on too many
Now Year's, and I have carried too
many pals- "you're my pal and the
greatest little guy I ever knew, my
name's Joe"—upstairs and down
stairs to be taken in by this story
concerning the innocence of Stan
ford athletes. I cannot believe that
anyone could manage to attend a
university for four years and still
not be able to recognize the odor
til the legal, fractionated liquid, and
those who can believe that must be
.somewhat naive themselves.
