# Kiesel Boosts Bears' Hopes
## 
### Albert Guerard, Jr 
The Bullet is ready. And as the
Bullet goes, .so goes California.
California's Captain of the Crip
ples, Bullet Bob Kiesel, whose
strained muscles have kept him
from running in any meet this year,
is in shape again, and ready to do
or die for the Golden Bear.
Dave iVluir. sprinter, Hal Blunt
ing, sprinter and broad-jumper,
and Bob Raftery, miler, will also
face the starter's gun after weeks
of agonizing inactivity. California's
track royalty is 011 its throne.
In brief, this power shapes up as
follows:
SPRINTS—KieseI and Muir are
certain to be far below top form.
While Kiesel was dashing to inter
national fame last year, Muir was
only a step behind. Once he was
clocked in 9.6. But his best times this
year are 10.3 for the century and 22.9
for the lurlong. Hudson may prove
the best Bear sprinter Saturday. He
has run 10.1 and 22.2. Held, Brant
ing, and Coupe may also run.
Average Quarter-Milers
QUARTER—Jim Van LobenSels,
who ran a 49.9 quarter against the
Olympic Club, ran four other races
in slower than 51 seconds. Street has
shown constant improvement, shav
ing 53 seconds 1o 50.2 in his most
recent race. Johnson, Landon, and
Miller are 52-second performers.
HALF-MILE — Bob Reynolds
(1.57.6 is the best half-miler. He can
spot Woody Kitchell (1:59.6) about
ten or twelve yards. Bob Raftery,
the miler, and Dick Brace, a fresh
man, can beat both varsity perform
ers.
MILE RUN—Bog Raftery, winner
in last year's Big Meet, has been
badly slowed up by injuries; at his
best he is only a few yards better
than teammate Woody Kitchell who
lapped the California Oval four
times in 4:31.1 last Friday. Harry
Anderson ran 4:38 against the Olym
pic Club, and he should battle it out
with Jim Feme of Stanford for third
place. Copeland and Lucas are other
possibilities.
Raftery Leads Two-Mile
TWO-MILE —Here again Raftery
leads the pack (if he runs). He is
only a shade better than Bob Lee
who won against U.S.C. in 10:00.9.
Dick Raymond has ability, but not
enough experience to beat Raftery,
Lee, or Stanford's Phil Morentin.
HURDLES—High hurdlers: Coe
(15.2), Lewis (15.5), Douma (15.8),
H. Clarke (16), Kindt (16.2). In the
lows Coe sadly outclasses his team
mates. He has run 23.8, which is
pretty fair time.
