# Coast Ball Loop Swings Into 2nd Week Of Play
## 
### 
With the second week of Pacific
Coast League baseball in progress,
Oakland's league-leading Acorns
this week entertain last season's
champions from Portland in the fea
ture series.
San Francisco and the Missions,
and Los Angeles and Hollywood
meet in a pair of civil war series,
while Seattle plays at Sacramento
in the remaining games. After one
week of play. Oakland rests in the
top position one game ahead of Los
Angeles, in second place.
Pre-season dope rated Portland,
Los Angeles and Hollywood as the

strongest teams in the loop. The
Missions, always a slow-starting
club, should hit their stride within
a few weeks.
The Seals, with four inexperienced
youngsters in their line-up, are as
yet an unknown quality although
they stand in a tie with Hollywood
for third place at present. Jerry
Donovan, San Francisco outfielder,
is riding the bench with a pulled
leg muscle, but may be able to get
back into the game this week.
Batting honors for the first week
went to Joe Palmisano, hard-hitting
Portland receiver, with nine safeties
in Ifi trips to the plate for an aver
age of .506.
