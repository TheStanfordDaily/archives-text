# CARD POLO COACH HACKS BRAIN OVER ARIZONA LINE-UP
## 
### 
It's worse than a jig-saw puzzle, j
Six good polo players for four j
positions. Captain Dick Gordan, ;
coach of the Card riders, continues
to fret over which four men to pick i
for the biggest polo series of the j
season: Stanford versus Arizona this !
Friday and Saturday.
Luppe Luppen and Woody Melone j
are practical cinches to start at the j
one and two berths. But that leaves
Pat Robb, Kemp Maer, Captain Pete j
Gillham, and Johnny Myers for the J
other two positions.
If Gillham starts at three, then j
hard-hitting Johnny Myers will play i
back. But while Myers is the well- j
known demon on defense, his un- i
happy trick of fouling makes his j
selection doubtful.
Kemp Maer played some smart :
polo against Arizona in last Decern- |
ber's series. He is a steady player,
but lacks Myers' long drives.
Then there is the possible corn- j
bination of Pat Robb at three and
Gillham at back. But Gillham's hard !
riding would probably be more use- j
ful up at three in the middle of the j
play.
Which all helps to explain gray- j
haired coaches.
