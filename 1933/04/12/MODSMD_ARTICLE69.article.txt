### 
Easing up on practice that every
man might be in top shape, frosh
j tracksters today went into one of
their final workouts for the Little
Big Meet Friday afternoon.
Coach Bill Ellington, at Monday
night's meeting when Chuck Nimmo
was elected captain, was optimistic.
For eight years the Bear Cubs were
unable to conquer the Papooses. But
j last year the Cubs slipped ahead
' when two Stanford men fell, and
I broke this record.
Maximum possibilities of the
! frosh are set at around 8(5 points;
capabilities are roughly 80; worst
prediction is a (J7-(>4 win for Cal.
The sprints are almost unpredict-
I able. California's trio of Vallejo,
Hurst, and Dick demand respect. All
1 are near 10-flat men—Vallejo once
having done 9.9, with the wind. Nor
can Reisner and Grayson be rated
inferior. Bobby did 9.9 in prep days
and 10-flat time recently. Reisner is
I one step behind Grayson.
Remaining events are likewise
hard to dope. Thompson, Cub high
! jumper, once jumped 6 feet \a
■ inch. Stanford's Nobs and Cottrell
| are both consistently within an inch
! or two of 6 feet.
