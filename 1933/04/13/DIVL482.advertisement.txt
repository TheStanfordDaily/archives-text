Another aid to business
... a Teletypewriter "Central"
Working out new ways to serve the communica
tion needs of the public is an objective always in the
minds of bell System men. I he new Teletypewriter
Exchange Service—typing by wire—is an example.
I'or some years Private \\ ire 1 eletypewriter Ser
vice has speeded communication between separated
units of many large organizations. I elephone men —
anxious to make this service more widely useful
have now established I eletypewriter central offices,
through which any subscriber to the service may be
connected directly with any other subscriber. Both
can type back and forth — their messages being re
produced simultaneously at each point.
This new service provides fast, dependable com
munication and does for the written word what tele
phone service does for the spoken word. It is one
more Bell System contribution to business efficiency.
