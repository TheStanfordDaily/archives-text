# Play Readings Started Last Year By Gantner

### JAMES SANDOE 
The .sponsorship by Sword and
Sandals of ;> series of play readings
had i(.s beginning largely in a series
oT informal afternoon readings of
eighteenth century comedies on
warm afternoons when study seemed
impossible and amusement difficult.
It was Vallejo Gantner who first
suggested the formal readings and
began an ambitious program with
Noel Coward's "Private Lives." Af
ter this, Gantner and James Lyons,
whose last campus appearance was
as Romeo, directed readings of
"Young Woodley,' "The Road to
Rome," and "Olympia."
That was during spring quarter a
year ago. During the summer quar
ter three more readings were pre
sented, the first, Milne's '"Truth
About Blayds," the second, an ob
scure but amusing comedy by Noel

Coward and Wyeherly's brilliant
"Way of the World."
Gantner, receiving last fall George
S. Kaufman's permission to read the
current New York musical success,
"Of Thee 1 Sing." presented that.
This was followed by the organiza
tion's first attempt to present trag
edy. Ibsen's "Ghosts" was received
with considerable favor by an audi
ence which, like nearly all the rest,
filled the Little Theatre. Last quarter
it was found advisable to present
only one reading, "The the
Thing," Molnar's ingenious and
scrambled high comedy.
Tonight the organization is mak
ing its second venture into recog
nizedly great serious drama. John
Webster's "The Duchess of Malfi,"
written not long before 1624, when
it was first printed, is the play.
