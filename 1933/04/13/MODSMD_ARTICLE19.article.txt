# Pi Phi's Fix Goal As 5th Queen Post
## Masque Ball Invitations On Sale Tomorrow 
### Stan Beaubaire 
Bids for the Masque Ball will be
sold at the A.S.S.U. offices in the I
Old Union, starting tomorrow noon,
Andy Harris announced last night.
For the first time in Masque Ball

history they will be available at the
new low of $1.50 per couple.
Meanwhile, further agitation on
the part of campus women has
forced Rally Committee officials
to declare that all candidates for
the post of Queen will be given
another 15-pound leeway when
official weighing-in ceremonies
are conducted tomorrow. This
means that those contending for
regal honors must tip the scales at
120 pounds or more.
Lone Kappa Queen
"Four out of five," reads a Pally
Committee statement, "have been
Pi Phi's." This is in reference to
past queens of recent years. The
fifth was a Kappa, Jean Jamison.
The queens from Pi Beta Phi were
Marian Evans, Cecelia Sudden, Elsie-
Chase, and Marion Hewlett.
It is reported from authoritative
sources that the Kappa house has
at last banded together in an attempt
to defeat the "four out of five"' jinx
and place a Kappa queen on the
throne. Although several meetings
were held, the women were reticent
on the subject, declining to reveal
their choice before the polls open
tomorrow morning.
OfTicial scales for checking
weights have been secured from
Encina Gymnasium and will be
on hand when nominations open
tomorrow.
Costume Display
As various campus groups gath
ered to back their favorite couples,
those in charge of the King Contest
pointed out that, although it took
22,582 votes to elect the famous
Prelsnik-Hewlett combination last
year, probably a much smaller sum
will serve the purpose next week.
A total of $225.82 was invested in
that duo in 1932.
Costumes continue on display to
day in the Union Cellar and the
Bookstore, where Herb Sanderson
and Marty Krupp are taking orders
for Ball disguises. Prices quoted are
described as extremely reasonable.
