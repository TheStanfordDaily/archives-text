# Paly Will Try Beer Test Case
## 
### 
Charged witli violating Palo Alto's
ordinance forbidding sale of "malt,
or alcoholic beverages," Harry
Brady, Palo Alio soft drink pro
prietor, was cited in police court
yesterday in a test case suit brought
by Henry Peterson to determine the
legality of the sale of near beer
within the city limits of Palo Alto.
Palo Alto officials pointed out the
case may serve as a stepping-stone
to a test of the sale of the newly
legalized 3.2 per cent beer in the
eity. Although it was pointed out
the police court has no power to void
a eity ordinance, its decision will
bear upon the legality of the present
prohibition.
