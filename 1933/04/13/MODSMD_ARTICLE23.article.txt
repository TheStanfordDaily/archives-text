# Morris Awarded Medal As Cards Score Triple Win
## Wayne Bannister, Bromley Smith, Win Second, Third Places as Stanford Orators Score Complete Shutout Against California Trio 
### DAVE MELLINKOFF 
Stanford orators winning three out of three places in the thirt.\-
ninth annual Joflrc Medal Debate, Mary-Kathcrine Morris, president
of the A.W.S., last night swept to victory with a dramatic denunciation
of French economic policy.
Wayne Bannister, who also spoke for the negative of "Resolved, That,
in the li«ht of world economic recovery, France has been justified in her
international economic policy since Versailles," took second.
Bromley Smith, Stanford's sole exponent of French financial policy,
placed third to give Stanford a clean sweep of the entire contest.
Mary-Katherine Morris, in her medal-winning argument, outlined the
course of world economic entanglements since the Treaty of Versailles.
With clarity and finesse she showed how French policy had led "Germany

into economic subjugation," caused
the collapse of the Austrian banking
system, closed the German Reicha
bank, and forced England off the
gold standard by her withdrawals
of gold.
Blind Orator
Jacobus Ten Broek, California's
blind orator who .spoke from Braille
notes, added statistical denounce
ment to the case against France.
Miss Margaret Yoder was Berkeley's
representative on the affirmative
side. James Koford, negative, de
clared that Germany's saber rattling
had now been replaced by France's
franc jingling.
"When French soldiers left the
Ruhr, French politicians and econo
mists took over the job," was Wayne
Bannister's introduction to his nega
tive argument. He made a three
fold attack upon French economic
policy in Reparations, War Debts,
and Finance. Bannister character
ized France's action in these re
spective fields with the words,
DRAIN. DEFAULT, DEFLATE. Said
Baimister: "The ebb of world pros
perity meant the flow of French
hegemony."
Smith Defends France
In one of the most colorful
speeches of the evening Bromley
Smith defended France's economic
activities as efforts "to put her house
in order." He claimed that a policy
of "self-interest" was the intelligent
policy for France surrounded by a
body of hostile nations. "Thank
God that I have such a government,"
should be the exclamation of every
Frenchman, said Smith.
Each speaker was allowed fifteen
minutes for the complete presenta
tion of his case—constructive and
rebuttal speeches. Rebuttals were
characterized by fire and brevity.
Lieutenant-Commander Stewart F.
Bryant, U.S.N. Retired, as chair
man, explained to the audience that
the debaters had prepared the
speeches in two hours' time, without
benefit of food.
John L. McNab, San Francisco
attorney; Mrs. G. Spencer Hall, so
cial worker; Dr. H. A. Shuder, di
rector of education at San Quentin;
Dr. F. M. Stanger of San Mateo
Junior College; and Lester L. Morse
of Palo Alto rendered the decision.
