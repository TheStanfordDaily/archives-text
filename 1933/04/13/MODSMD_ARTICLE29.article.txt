# Hitler Hoists the Swastika Above the German Universities
## 
### 
And now I lie Nazi swastika will most likely adorn the
crests of <Ju<■ lill fraternities in German universities, since
flic Hitler regime has turned ils addition to the educational
system. News dispatches from Merlin yesterday spoke of a
new "Prussian student's code," which abolishes parliamen
tarism and substitutes Xa/i leadership. The general idea
seems to he that university executives, both faculty and
student, will be replaced with new administrators ap
pointed by the Nazi powers above.
Of course, the objective is being attained slightly more
diplomatically. The new student code has been proclaimed,
and those educators and student officials at whom it was
directed, having found the new code incompatible with
their standards, are resigning.
The situation is rather ditlicult for the American uni
versity student to imagine. Such invasion of the educa
tional system by the I nited States government would
merely breed contempt and even hatred for the man ol
faction attempting it, among American college men. Per
haps the German collegian looks at things difFerentlv. Per
haps he is not so thoroughly saturated with the concepts,
both worthy and shallow, of democracy as his American
cousin. Certainly, if the German college man possesses a
spirit even remotely resembling that of tlie American un
dergraduate, he will resent the racial discrimination which
the new Nazi eode advocates.
It is quite likely true that the "truth about Germany"
suffers great disfiguration in finding its way outside the
Prussian borders. However, Ihe latest Nazi dictatorial play
thing, the university, cannot logically be construed as an
asset of Ilitlerism. Not when the Prussian Academy of
Science places Albert Einstein, its most illustrious member,
in bad standing for passively failing to rally to the support
of a governmental policy which he cannot, with self-respect,
admire.
