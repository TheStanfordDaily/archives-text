## A 						GOD WALKS AGAIN—ALL HAIL 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
Those of you who do not read
the Hearst press probably will be
unaware that history is being made.
A move is on wheels now to dedi
cate April 30 in honor of F. R.
Roosevelt. A national holiday wili
be Sunday on which day the nation
will pray for our President, and
Mayor Rossi includes prosperity as
another object of the day.
These "national movements" are
easy to start. A representative of
the Hearst press approaches a mayor
or a governor. "Will you favor our
movement or will you not," says
the representative. "I will," responds
the executive with as much fervor
and under similar circumstances as
the bride at a shotgun wedding. A
proclamation is written and the
movement is under way.
I
This idea of embalming Roosevelt
before a year is up is most unfor
tunate. First of all, it might prove |
embarrassing to all concerned
should Roosevelt and the upturn of
the business cycle not happen to
coincide. If 1936 does not bring
prosperity, the majority will be
more willing to have Roosevelt him
self roasted than bring burnt offer
ings to the White House. Secondly,
it changes "Our Frank" to the Hon
orable Franklin D. Roosevelt, Presi
dent of these United States. It puts
a gold-edged stiff collar on the man
who is attempting to be the bunk
mate of the "Forgotten Man."
Roosevelt doesn't want to be canon- ,
ized.
Then again, if Roosevelt were j
made a saint, he would be impervi-

ous to criticism like Washington or
Lincoln are now. The President has
been given greater power and prob
ably will get more in the future.
With th enation ready to try any
thing, with Democratic congressmen
hungry for gravy, and the Repub
licans completely demoralized, there
will be no check on Roosevelt.
Of course, so far he is using his
power in a way that appeals and so
that no one cares how much power
he has. I3ut anyone can slip. Once
put in the temple of the gods with
a special Sunday put aside to wor
ship him, it will be impossible to
mention the fact that he has slipped.
He will have the press censored
almost as effectively as do the
sweeping orders of Hitler or Mus
solini. And in a country of our size,
j once the organs of public expres
sion are closed, democracy joins the
dodo in the cool woods of Erewhon.
In short, it ceases.
Furthermore, it sets a bad prece
dent. If every president who re
ceives a large majority is to get a
holiday—(and if one gets it, others
will) —the calendar will soon be
hopelessly cluttered. Every ex-ward
politician with a proper number of
lucky breaks will become a saint.
Presidents will cease to be mortal
men. They will be gods among men.
Their position, as it is, too often
bars criticism.
It is bad enough to deify the dead.
Let us keep the living with us—at
| least as long as they breathe our air
and listen to Little Orphan Annie
on the radio.
