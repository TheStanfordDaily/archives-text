# Campus Opinion
## PAGING MR. MELLINKOFF 
### 
Dear Sir:
I have been, watching your Daily
column for some time, hoping and
praying to see some mention of a
condition which I believe needs
rectifying. Undoubtedly you have
noticed the large number of tour
ists who daily pass merrily hither
and thither through our fair campus,
gawking at the students and build
ings like a child at his first circus.
This condition is particularly ag
gravating on Sundays when the
happy townspeople throng through
our portals like insects and turn
the roads in back of Lagunita into
miniature Fifth Avenues. However,
had they stopped at simply monopo
lizing our thoroughfares, you never
would have received this letter.
The fact is that a week ago last
Sunday I had occasion to go past
the Administration Building in the
early afternoon and, lo and behold,
there sprawled on our freshly cut
lawns were several automobile loads
of people with their blankets spread
on the ground and the owners re
clining thereon in a fashion some
thing akin to the seals at the zoo.
Yes, there they were, lolling in the
sun within a stone's throw of Presi
dent Wilbur's office. I really don't
know what impression this must
have left on others but for myself
I couldn't Help thinking (and sing
ing), "And So At Last It's Come
To This."
Nevertheless, all things do have
their cheerful side, and so has this
unfortunate situation. At the present
time (I am so informed) the Uni
versity treasury is none too full, so
why not obtain a little additional
revenue out of this unpleasant pre
dicament, since it exists anyway.
Now my idea is to charge these peo
ple a nominal sum for the pleasure
of wandering over our campus.

I The rate might be fixed at, say
25 cents per person, with a cover
charge of $L for those who desire
to take a nap on the lawn outside
of President Wilbur's office, and a
$2 rate for those who prefer the
sanctity of the Inner Quad. In fact,
it is even conceivable that one of
the political science rooms might be
turned into a hamburger stand over
the week-ends in order to make our
visitors as comfortable as possible.
I, of course, realize that to pursue
this course would be something new
in the annals of Stanford history.
Undoubtedly there would be strong
opposition to this policy, not, how
ever, from Stanford students. Any
way, Abe, what do you think of the
proposal?
Yours, Ben True, '34
