Bear ace. Coughlin stands above
everyone in the Conference to
gether with Jack Tidball of
U.C.L.A.
Chuck Otis will probably play
against the Conference surprise of
the 1933 net season, Gene Smith,
who has won all his matches with
ease, as well as taking* a surprise
victory over Ed Chandler in exhi
bition matches last week.
For the remaining singles, the
Bears present a well-balanced team,
;.ll practically of the same playing
ability, in Neiden, Thompson, Whit
man, Holmes, and Gruhler.
