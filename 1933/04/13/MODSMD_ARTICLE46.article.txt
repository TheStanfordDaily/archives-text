Miss Helen Jacobs of Berkeley,
Cal., who annually alternates with
Mrs. Helen Wills Moody of Berkeley.
Cal., at prefixing the word "Queen"
to her name, because of her mascu
line ability to whack a tennis ball
hither and yon without regard for
windows, or opponents' reputations,
will probably very shortly be im
peached for treason by the League
for Maintenance of the Prestige of
Amateur Athletes.
This League is a most august
body with press agents and news
releases and free publicity in every
newspaper in the United States
whose owner is a baseball fan and
receives a season pass, or whose
publisher likes the aunt-in-law of
the heavyweight champion.
All of which makes me surer than
ever that the League for the Main
tenance of (he Prestige of Amateur
Athletes will impeach Miss Helen
Jacobs. In fact, I would not be sur
prised if they court-martialed and
quartered her, for did not Miss Ja
cobs consent to play a friendly little
set of tennis with Sammy Lee of
Stanford just for the fun and with
out any gallery or publicity or even
an official official?
Crowd Greets Helen
She did that, and to make it
worse, the friendly set (which Miss
Jacobs desired because Mr. Lee is
a friend of hers) was not even ad
vertised as an exhibition match.
Or rather, perhaps I should say
that Miss Jacobs did not wish to be
heralded. As a matter of fact, when
Miss Jacobs arrived for her friendly
little set of tennis with Sammy Lee,
she found a large crowd of patrons
of the League already there.

Miss Jacobs had traveled to Stan
ford merely to see another friend of
hers (Norm Cleaveland) and to
watch the charity rugby match that
day. She was somewhat disturbed
when she found that she herself was
advertised as the main counler-at
traction to the rugby game.
Now, of course, the League had
learned of Miss Jacobs' desire to
play a friendly little set with Sammy
Lee in time, and had conveniently
arranged for a crowd to be present.
There might have been only a tem
porary suspension of license or pos
sibly a good talking-to had Miss
Jacobs not- seemed surprised and
not pleased at the crowd.
Lee Is Victorious
But Miss Jacobs, who did not at
all like losing to Sammy Lee 6-4 in
a friendly little match before pa
trons of the League who didn't be
long there anyway, suggested that
she thought it might be a fair idea
to allow even a tennis star of the
very brightest brilliance (just once
a year or so, of course) to play a
friendly little set just for the fun
of it.
And that is the treason.
I do not know whether Miss Ja
cobs ever will be impeached, but I
do know a damned good end to this
story. The friendly little match was
so incidental that Lee didn't even
tell his folks about it; he simply
refused Chuck Otis' offer to play on
Saturday, saying that Helen Jacobs

was coming down.
And 'way up in Seattle. Sammy's
father read, much to his surprise,
that his boy Sam had beaten Helen
Jacobs in tennis. For news of the
match—not even an exhibition, but
only a friendly little set—was dis
tributed (by the grapevine tele
graph of the League for Mainten
ance of the Prestige of Amateur
Athletes) to every newspaper on
the Coast. But in spite of the
League's last-minute, Herculean
efforts, the match did not receive
(he publicity it deserved, and Miss
Jacobs may yet be impeached for
playing a friendly little matclj of

do know a damned good end to this

so incidental that Lee didn't even
tell his folks about it; he simply
refused Chuck Otis' offer to play on
Saturday, saying that Helen Jacobs

was coming down.
And 'way up in Seattle. Sammy's
father read, much to his surprise,
that his boy Sam had beaten Helen

match—not even an exhibition, but
only a friendly little set—was dis
tributed (by the grapevine tele

Athletes) to every newspaper on
the Coast. But in spite of the

Miss Helen Jacobs of Berkeley,
Cal., who annually alternates with
Mrs. Helen Wills Moody of Berkeley.
Cal., at prefixing the word "Queen"
to her name, because of her mascu
line ability to whack a tennis ball
hither and yon without regard for
windows, or opponents' reputations,
will probably very shortly be im
peached for treason by the League
for Maintenance of the Prestige of
Amateur Athletes.
This League is a most august
body with press agents and news
releases and free publicity in every
newspaper in the United States
whose owner is a baseball fan and
receives a season pass, or whose
publisher likes the aunt-in-law of
the heavyweight champion.
All of which makes me surer than
ever that the League for the Main
tenance of (he Prestige of Amateur
Athletes will impeach Miss Helen
Jacobs. In fact, I would not be sur
prised if they court-martialed and
quartered her, for did not Miss Ja
cobs consent to play a friendly little
set of tennis with Sammy Lee of
Stanford just for the fun and with
out any gallery or publicity or even
an official official?
Crowd Greets Helen
She did that, and to make it
worse, the friendly set (which Miss
Jacobs desired because Mr. Lee is
a friend of hers) was not even ad
vertised as an exhibition match.
Or rather, perhaps I should say
that Miss Jacobs did not wish to be
heralded. As a matter of fact, when
Miss Jacobs arrived for her friendly
little set of tennis with Sammy Lee,
she found a large crowd of patrons
of the League already there.

Miss Jacobs had traveled to Stan
ford merely to see another friend of
hers (Norm Cleaveland) and to
watch the charity rugby match that
day. She was somewhat disturbed
when she found that she herself was
advertised as the main counler-at
traction to the rugby game.
Now, of course, the League had
learned of Miss Jacobs' desire to
play a friendly little set with Sammy
Lee in time, and had conveniently
arranged for a crowd to be present.
There might have been only a tem
porary suspension of license or pos
sibly a good talking-to had Miss
Jacobs not- seemed surprised and
not pleased at the crowd.
Lee Is Victorious
But Miss Jacobs, who did not at
all like losing to Sammy Lee 6-4 in
a friendly little match before pa
trons of the League who didn't be
long there anyway, suggested that
she thought it might be a fair idea
to allow even a tennis star of the
very brightest brilliance (just once
a year or so, of course) to play a
friendly little set just for the fun
of it.
