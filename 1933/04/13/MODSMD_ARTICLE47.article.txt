# FROSH TRACKMEN IN TOP FORM FOR CALIFORNIA MEET
## 
### 
With one day left before the sea
son's climax for one of the best
fro.sh track teams ever produced on
the Farm, all men were reported in
top shape and no workout is slated
for today.
Coach Ellington has decided
what men will run in which events,
and contrary to expectations of
many sports scribes, including
those of the Daily California!!,
Captains Brace and Ninuno will
not meet in the half-mile event.
Rather fortunate this should prove
for Brace, a remarkable half-miler,
but a little short of Nimmo's class,
Nimmo's 1:58 run against varsity
mi ler Ferrie on Monday being a full
second better than Brace's fastest
effort.
Strength in the weight events has
been distinctly reversed since last
year's meet wm*n the Cubs gathered
17 of their 71 y-> points in the shot
and discus. Stanford figures to take
about the same number this year.
Five Indians have slung the platter
farther than any California man.
Thorell will be the main Bear hope
in the shot, but is unlikely to get
better than a third against Reynolds,
Leedy, Calloway, and Brandin.
Fitzgerald of California is a
cinch to take the javelin, and the
Cubs figure a second and third in
the event not unlikely. Vallejo in
the broad jump and Haskell,
vaulter, are also relied on for
Cub wins.
The quarter-mile will be a con
tested event of the highest order.
Davis, best Stanford 440 man, has
been shoved up to the half. This
leaves Bagnasacco, of California, and
Dellinger as chief contestants. Both
men run the lap in about 52 sec
' onds.
Entry list will be found on page 4.
The Free State Government has
been asked to make the popular "A
Soldier's Song" the national anthem.
