# ARIZONA POLOISTS, CHAMPS IN 1932, SET FOR CARDS
## 
### CHUCK CHAPPELL 
Rated by Lewis Stoddard, presi
dent of the American Polo Associa
tion, as the best collegiate polo team
in the United States last year, the
University of Arizona will ride on
to the field tomorrow against Stan
ford, boasting another of their con
sistently strong quartets of mallet
wielders.
Tomorrow's and Saturday's games
will virtually settle the collegiate
polo championship of the West, with
Stanford conceded a good chance to
upset the highly-touted Wildcat
four. Both games will be played on
an even basis, with no handicap
granted to either team.
Down in sunshiny, rainless Tucson,
seat of the University of Arizona
and home of Stanford's Captain Pete

Gillham, weather conditions permit !
a lot of polo, which in large meas
ure accounts for Arizona's superior
ity. Another reason for the Wildcats'
brilliant record is the fact that they !
are trained by Colonel Holderness, \
former coach of the West Point polo 1
team.
The Arizona lineup will consist of !
Gregg Hathaway at number one, i
Bill Clark at two, Jack Budlong at
three, and Nelson Brown at back, j
John Means will accompany the 1
team as a substitute. Clark, known
to his intimates as Ducky, is captain
of the visiting team and a regular
from last year's stellar aggregation.
Tickets to both games will be 25
cents and can be secured at the
gates of the Highway field at game
lime. *
