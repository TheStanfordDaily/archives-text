# Indians Hold Big Margin In Field Events
## 
### Albert Guerard, Jr 
Bearing out it tradition of many
I years, Stanford's Big Meet scoring
. i power will be concentrated in the
i field events. Indian performers are
fairly certain to win the shot put,
discus, and pole vault, they have a
j 60-40 chance in the broad jump and
! the javelin, and an even break in
the high jump.
Here it is:
SHOT PUT—Dave Meek is a fine
shot-putter. He tossed 49 feet against
U.S.C. But Dunn, Gray, Lyman, and
Laborde of Stanford have all bet
tered this mark, so the sum-total
of Meek's efforts on Saturday will
probably earn him at MOST a single
I point. Chili Bertoli (4(5 feet), and
Joe Darracq (44 feet) will not
qualify.
Dunn Looks Good
DISCUS — Here again the Stan
ford monopoly is unshatterable.
, Gordon Dunn and Here Laborde
will be shooting at 165 feet, while
! Bertoli (141 feet), Fink (135 feet),
' and Bolden (128 feet), will be mir
j acle men if they garner a single
i point between them.
POLE VAULT—California's Bill
Koblik is the third best pole-vaulter
in Pacific Coast intercollegiate com
petition. His 13 feet, 6 inch record
brands him as third best in the Big
Meet.
BROAD JUMP—California's best
i broad-jumper in history did all his
j good jumping last year as a fresh
i man. Hal Branting jumped over 23
I feet in every yearling meet in 1932;
j this spring he has exceeded 22 feet
only twice. California will depend
1 on the more consistent Micelli (22 j
feet, 8 inches) and Talley (22 feet, j
I 2 inches). Stanford's Lewis and Wil- !
liams have both bettered 23 feet.
Many in Javelin
JAVELIN—Jim Miles almost made
j the Olympic team last year, this ;
spring he is down to 180 feet, though '
he touched 196 once. Ed Waterbury j
is far more consistent. He has done
197 feet, Pierce (187 feet) and Fink
(182 feet) are the others. Stanford's !
Johnny Mottram has exceeded 190
' feet in every meet.
HIGH JUMP—Relatively speaking, j
| Stanford's weakest event is the high ;
jump. California's Paul Jacques,,
I who jumped 6 feet, 6 inches in high
school, has yet to go over 6 feet, 2 |
; in college. Vernon Ball did 6 feet, -
' 4 inches in a prep meet; his best
mark this year is 5 feet, 11. Dave
Meek did 6 feet, 1 in high school; i
his 1933 record is also 5 feet, 11. i
Lloyd Schween of Stanford has done j
6 feet, 2lb this year (in practice).
Bearing out it tradition of many
I years, Stanford's Big Meet scoring
. i power will be concentrated in the
i field events. Indian performers are
fairly certain to win the shot put,

j acle men if they garner a single
i point between them.
POLE VAULT—California's Bill
Koblik is the third best pole-vaulter
in Pacific Coast intercollegiate com
petition. His 13 feet, 6 inch record
brands him as third best in the Big
Meet.
BROAD JUMP—California's best
i broad-jumper in history did all his
j good jumping last year as a fresh
i man. Hal Branting jumped over 23
I feet in every yearling meet in 1932;
j this spring he has exceeded 22 feet
only twice. California will depend
1 on the more consistent Micelli (22 j
feet, 8 inches) and Talley (22 feet, j
I 2 inches). Stanford's Lewis and Wil- !
liams have both bettered 23 feet.
Many in Javelin
JAVELIN—Jim Miles almost made
j the Olympic team last year, this ;
spring he is down to 180 feet, though '
he touched 196 once. Ed Waterbury j
is far more consistent. He has done
197 feet, Pierce (187 feet) and Fink
(182 feet) are the others. Stanford's !
Johnny Mottram has exceeded 190
' feet in every meet.
HIGH JUMP—Relatively speaking, j
| Stanford's weakest event is the high ;
jump. California's Paul Jacques,,
I who jumped 6 feet, 6 inches in high
school, has yet to go over 6 feet, 2 |
; in college. Vernon Ball did 6 feet, -
' 4 inches in a prep meet; his best
mark this year is 5 feet, 11. Dave
Meek did 6 feet, 1 in high school; i
his 1933 record is also 5 feet, 11. i
Lloyd Schween of Stanford has done j
6 feet, 2lb this year (in practice).
Bearing out it tradition of many
I years, Stanford's Big Meet scoring
. i power will be concentrated in the
i field events. Indian performers are
fairly certain to win the shot put,
discus, and pole vault, they have a
j 60-40 chance in the broad jump and
! the javelin, and an even break in
the high jump.
Here it is:
SHOT PUT—Dave Meek is a fine
shot-putter. He tossed 49 feet against
U.S.C. But Dunn, Gray, Lyman, and
Laborde of Stanford have all bet
tered this mark, so the sum-total
of Meek's efforts on Saturday will
probably earn him at MOST a single
I point. Chili Bertoli (4(5 feet), and
Joe Darracq (44 feet) will not
qualify.
Dunn Looks Good
DISCUS — Here again the Stan
ford monopoly is unshatterable.
, Gordon Dunn and Here Laborde
will be shooting at 165 feet, while
! Bertoli (141 feet), Fink (135 feet),
' and Bolden (128 feet), will be mir
j acle men if they garner a single
i point between them.
