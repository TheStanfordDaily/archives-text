Put this Blow-out
Protection on Your

i
INVESTIGATION shows that
the chances are better than !
even you'll have a blow-out some j
day. When, nobody knows. But i
right now is the time to learn the j
real cause of blow-outs . . . and the
new way to prevent them.
When you drive 40, 50, 60 and
,o—mile after mile—terrific heat
is generated inside the tire. Rubber j
and fabric begin to separate. A ;
blister starts—and grows—b:gj;er
and bigger—until HANG! A blow
out! And a terrible drug pulls your
car ofl the road.
jVeiu Invention
Prevents Bloiv-onts
But now Goodrich has created the i
amazing Life-Saver Golden Ply.
'Ibis remarkable invention resists
intense heat. Rubber arid fabric 1
don't separate. 'I bus, blisters don't
form. Blow-outs are prevented by
overcoming their cause.
At gruelling speeds on the j
world's fastest track, the new
Goodrich Silvertown, with the
Life-Saver Golden Ply, lasted .{
times as long as first quality tires
that did not have this feature.
These S!LVI RTOWNS never blew
— because the Life-Saver Golden i
Ply refused to give.
Safer Against Skidding
And that isn't all. Scientific tests I
show that the Goodrich Safety ,
Silvertown has the most skid
resisting tread on the road. Its
squeegee drying action gives your j
car extra road-grip and reduces
danger of skidding to a minimum.
Let us show you this amazing
new tire — now made THREE
TIMES SAEER! Yon can put this
blow-out protection on your car—
at no extra cost. For Goodrich
Safety Silvertowns cost not a penny
more than other standard tires.
