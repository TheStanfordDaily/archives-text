# U.C.-CARD NINES SET FOR FINAL BASEBALL TILT
## Stanford Hurlers Battle Bear learn Tomorrow Across The Bay MEET TROJANS TODAY S.C. Plays Indians At 3: 15 This Afternoon 
### 
Wax- club in hand and with the J
Big Scries hanging in the balance, j
Stanford's Indians will stalk, the <
Bear on the new California diamond !
immediately following Ihe Big Meet ,
at 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon af- j
tor doing battle with El Trojan from ;
U.S.C. at 3:15 o'clock today on the i
Sunken Diamond.
Tomorrow's game will climax a
fairly successful ball season which
1
will probably close with Stanford
as runner-up to California. The j
Bears' oaily league defeat this sea
son was suffered at the bands of '
the Indians in tlic first game of |
the series, when Herm Kstes slow- \
balled the Cards to an 8 to 3
victory.
California turned the tables in the i
second encounter to score four runs I
I
in a tenth inning rally and win 7 !
to 3.

Due to their almost perfect record, j
Clint Evans' charges are slight fa
vorites tomorrow, but the liking;
Stanford batters have displayed for !
California pitching, outhitting the '
Bears 23 to 19 in the first two games i
played, may upset the dope.
Triplet! at Third
Bill Triplctt, two year reserve,!
will probably get the call at third â€¢
base, and Ray Forsythe may start in j
left field unless he replaces Triplctt. j
Both Captain Ike Livermore and :
Gordy Mallatratt will probably be j
kept on the bench in one or both J
games with sore arms.
Harry Stark will open in the box \
against U.S.C. this afternoon, and |
probably Fred Heringer will re- j
ceive the assignment against Cali- j
fornia tomorrow. There is also a |
possibility that Stan Anderson, ace
of last year's staff, who has adjusted j
his scholastic difficulties, will pitch. |
It is uncertain whether Hcrm
Estcs, who was hurt in practice i
Wednesday, will be able to pitch, j
but he will accompany the team
to Berkeley.
Zcke Keough or Bob Saunders j
will probably be Clint Evans' mound i
choice tomorrow. Keough bus been |
the most effective California hurlcr j
this season.
Tickets at IJ.A.C,
Hal Forney or Charley Upton will
take the hill for U.S.C. today in an
attempt to win the deciding game of
the Indian-Trojan series. The Cards
split with Troy in two games played
in the south recently.
A.S.S.U. card holders may pur
chase tickets for the California game
at the B.A.C. office for 25 cents to
day. General admission tickets arc |
