# Ben Eastman Quits Hospital
## Will See Berkeley Meet; May Be Ready May 6 
### Don Douglass 
Nobody knows whether or not
Stanford's Ben Eastman, holder of
■ four world's records in the middle
distances, will be able to run in the
second U.S.C. meet on May 6. Not
even Ben himself, propped up on
his bed at the Palo Alto Hospital
yesterday, can tell.
"I'm pretty sure I won't be able
to make the first meet," Ben says,
"but the second one's still unsettled.
The doctors are awfully uncertain
about it.
"But anyway, I certainly hope to
run in the 1.C.4-A.'s this summer."
A red-headed nurse comes in with
Ben's lunch, and he goes to work
on some broiled chicken.
Will Attend Big Meet
"They're letting me out of here
tomorrow," he says, trying some
salad. "I'll be on crutches, but I'll
sure be up at Berkeley for the meet.
It looks to me like we ought to win.
i I haven't figured it out mathemati-
I cally, but I think we're going to
1 score somewhere around 70 points."
"How about the 1.C.4-A.V?" Ben
i repeats. He leans back and con
' sidcrs. "Well, we've got a better
! chance than last year—a heck of
a good chance, when you think of
! the new men on the team. Dunn,
Deacon, and Mottrain sure ought
to help.
"U.S.C. hasn't improved much.
They've still got lots of second- and
third-place strength. I hope I'll be
strong enough to take on both races
by then."
Has Not Tried 3.2
Ben is cautious about getting into
I the beer argument that his coach
started last week. "I haven't thought
much about it," he says, pouring out
a second glass of milk. "I guess
anybody who wants to be an athlete
is better off without anything like
that. It depends on the individual,
of course."
"Have you tried this 3.2 beer yet?"
"No, I haven't."
Ben polishes off the last of the
! chicken and begins on the chocolate
ice-cream.
"The next Olympics? They're
still a long way oIT. Naturally I'd
like to run in them again. It de
pends on what kind of a job I
have by then."
The nurse comes in to take away
the lunch tray. She's quite proud of
her famous patient.
"Yeah," Ben finishes, "I'll sure be
up at Berkeley tomorrow. I've got to
be there to watch my big brother
Sam run in the relay."
