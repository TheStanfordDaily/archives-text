# Farm's Athletes Slated To Sweep Annual Big Meet
## Daily Sports Staff Dopes Big Meet Score at 86½ to 44½; Lyman, Dunn, Gray, Laborde Cinch Shot, Discuss; Hables May Win Both Sprint Events 
### FRANCIS HAMILTON 
Ker-flop!
And so for the twenty-second tune In forty years of competition the
battered haunches of the shaggy old California Hear splatter into the
frying pan held up by Dink Templeton. Dink's grinning visage peers at it
with satisfaction as he contemplates the tenth straight blistering a Teinple
ton-coachcd Stanford track team will deliver to the good old Golden Bear.
Ten straight for Dink; and unless a miraculous uprooting of the good
old dope occurs, that will he the result tomorrow afternoon when the
tumult and the shouting dies at Edwards Held in Berkeley.
It should he a great day for Templeton; it should he a great day for
the hard-working athletes who will make a Stanford triumph possible.
And only one thing should prevent it from being a perfect day; Ben
♦ Eastman will not be in the fight.

The Blazer departs from his Big
Meet competition sitting on the side
lines.
With the victory conceded to
Stanford, most speculation con
cerns the final score of the two
squads. The Daily sports staff,
considering its guess as good as
the next "expert," lias figured the
score as 86Vt to 44 * •». Two clean
sweeps should he registered by
Stanford in the shot and discus
where the quartet of Lyman,
Dunn, Gray, and La horde appears
invincible. Otherwise, the events
are well-divided, with possibili
ties of upsets.
Hables is in great shape; he is
picked to take at least one race from

! Kiesel, and hits a good chance of
beating out the blond in both events.
: Morentin i.s given the edge in the
; two-mile, and if ho enters the mile,
| may shoot the dope full of holes,
i Zaches of Stanford is counted on;
he has a bad leg, but he has the
ability to win if he feels right.
Fullenwider will give Al Black
! man a hot fight for the lead in the
quarter. Von LobenSels has done
i better time than either, but has
i fallen back lately.
Murphy and Naylon have a chance
of placinß two and three in the 880.
These men arc closely matched and
either may place.
