### 
Yesterday's appearance of California and Stanford glee
clubs in joint concert brought to mind the days when the
Farm organization \v;is n far more active unit, one of ac
tunl aid to the I Diversity.
In the sadly distant pre-depression days, the Glee C.lnh
almost equaled Farm athletic teams in prestige, propor
tionate drawing - power, and publicity value. Stanford
singers toured the Pacific slope, appeared at high schools,
theatres, and cluhs, and recorded I'niversitv songs for
alumni throughout the country.
Of recent years, the Glee (Huh has necessarily curtailed
otl'-cainpus activity. Student managers have looked doubt
fully on louring plans; limes have changed since 11)27,
when a joint 1.(1.-Stanford concert in the Assemblv Hall
drew well at a dollar a head.
Possibly the Glee Club is on (lie road toward rebuild
ing on the old standard. The Kxecutivc Committee has
been induced to grant a hundred dollars. A Hood of new
singers is expected to appear at the annual spring tryouts,
scheduled for Monday and Wednesday nights.
It seems worthy of both student and administration at
tention in these days of dwindling registration that a tour
ing glee club, reaching all large high-schools in the slate
with a peculiarly effective appeal, is of immense value to
the I'niversitv.
