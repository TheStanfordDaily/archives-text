# A 						Week end on the Farm, with Too Many Sights to See
## 
### 
The crack of the <41111 starling 1110 mile run this after
noon in the Little HiiÂ» Meet at Angcll Field will signal the 1
opening of another of the Farm's glorious athletic week
ends. The Stanford man who has discovered that some of
the world's best sports entertainment is offered right on
his own campus has every reason to anticipate the present
week-end schedule, which includes the annual California-
Stanford freshman track meet, the Arizona polo series,
the Northern California Intercollegiate swimming cham
pionships, and a golf match with visiting Sacramento stars.
All those events on the campus, and the big attraction
ot the week-end, the Big Meet, at Berkeley, where the
sports fan with a car may also witness the freshman ten
nis matches, and the final game of the Big Series.
I rnlv remarkable are these athletic programs which
the B.A.C. manages to schedule for almost every spring
week-end, yet there are scores of Stanford men who re
tain the winter's motto of "'let's go to a show" as their after
noon prescription. With all due apologies to the Palo Alto
theatres, which stand out as the hospitable entertainment
centers ot an otherwise unexciting town, the flicker patrons
who attend on bright ami warm week-end afternoons are
suckers, pure and simple.
I ht- Board of Athletic Control needs no free advertis
ing, for the majority of Stanford men discover after a
quarter or two of residence that they are among the privi
leged few who may witness intercollegiate athletics at their
best. But to those who have not vet made that discovery,
this column recommends the sports program for this week
end as an introduction to what a majority consider the
most enjoyable of the many aspects of a Stanford educa-
I ion.
