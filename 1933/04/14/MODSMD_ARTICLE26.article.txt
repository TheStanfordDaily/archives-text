# Bid Sale Gets Under Way, as Co-eds Gyp to "Make Weight"
## 
### 
With campus would-be queens still trying to figure out
ways and means of "making the weight" hv this noon, bids
ior the annual Masque Hall go on sale today. Meanwhile
charges are being thrown all over the place, accusing this
|>r that committee member for setting the minimum weight
limit because of a hankering for such and such a queen
candidate. Of course the really smart aspirants will not be
bothered with their actual poundage, but will take a tip
from the Tanforan method of scaling in, and without much
danger of detection, for this is a contest to be decided by
popularity and dough-heaviness, not a beauty contest.
Despite its tomfoolery, the manner in which the Masque
Hall queen contest is run of!' is a credit to Stanford. It
proves that the Stanford man can carry through a bally
hoo campaign for charitable purposes with a great deal
more smoothness and "fun for all" than can the average
American luncheon club promoter.
Throughout the queen contest and bid sale for the ball,
the (.onvalescenl Home contribution which is the purpose
and result ol the whole show should not be forgotten. The
fun is clean, the cause is worthy and charitable. And speak
ing of charity, the student gels his turn at the receiving end
for a change, with bids selling al onlv a buck and a half.
