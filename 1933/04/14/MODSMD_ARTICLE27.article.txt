### ABE MELLINKOFF 
THESE lOWAN lIOKDES
In the year one B.R.L. (Before squitos will always be with us.

Roosevelt's Landslide), our Campus
was over-run by those Middlewest
ern hordes. There were the North
lowans from the Dakotas—the Visi
lowans from Nebraska—the Ostro
lowans from Missouri—not to men
tions the most numerous and pes
tiferous of the lot—the lowans,
themselves. Their .quest was not
"college people" in the native habi
tate" primarily; but • as you may
guess, "The Hoover Home."
Life on the "Farm" then was even
less secure than now. No one was
safe. From out of Ford Tudors
would protrude sunburned necks:
"Say, ken ya tell me where's the
Prisident's Home?" At that time, 1
couldn't; and in honesty, I was
forced to admit as much. With hor
ror—not untouched with some ter
ror—the visitor would drive off con
vinced that the bomb-throwing bol
shevik was at hand.
I finally learned the directions and
even now can repeat them swiftly
if not correctly. To protect the stu
dent body from these onslaughts—
which were unlimited by time or
place—l devised a plan. Each stu
dent was to carry a placard: "I don't
know where the Hoover Home is;
and if I did, I wouldn't tell." The
plan received little support—due
largely to the failure of the corn
price in that year which kept the
lowans in Iowa; and second, the
Roosevelt victory which transferred
interest from Stanford to Hyde
Park, New York.
Now, with the return of beer,
spring, and the threatened return of
prosperity—the hordes are with us
again. I am afraid, Mr. True —though
your Campus Opinion is true—that
to be perfectly truthful, nothing can
be done. With warm weather, the
visiting hordes and Lagunita's mo-

It is claimed that oil will obliter
ate the inosquitos but something in
finitely more potent will have to be
used on the hordes. Their tenacity
and omnipresence defies man, beast,
science, and the Administration. And
; that's wholesale defiance. The sug
gested plan to commercialize the
hordes by charging fees for sprawl
j ing rights—sell hot-dogs, etc., is also
impossible. They would rise up in
wrath and drive us off the campus
completely.
Imagine the Romans attempting
|to exact fees from the swarming
Goth.s as Ihey passed over the walls
of Rome. We on the Campus must
bow our heads in submissive silence.
The hordes are likely to charge us
j rent for staying here. Then, where
I would we be? All we can do is sit
in our rooms and pray for rain,
snow, earthquake, or lava flows.
Without these, the invasion cannot
be checked, even momentarily.
Furthermore, some of these lowans
may go home and discover oil on
J their farms. Then, perhaps, in their
philanthropic afterglow, they will
leave a few thousands to the place
where they lay in the grass—Stan
ford University.
