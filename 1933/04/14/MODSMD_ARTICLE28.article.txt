THE MATCH KING (Warner)—At
the Menlo Theatre.
"The Match King" is one of that
considerable number of movies
which each year try to capitalize
upon the news events which have
been outstanding.
Obviously an attempt to build
profits upon the collapse of Ivar
Kreuger's interests and his subse
quent suicide, this film had remark
able subject-matter. How it became
the ridiculous affair that it is re
mains a considerable problem.
Part of the blame must rest upon
the scenarist, who made of the in
credible Swede's career only a
tawdry melodrama. Another part of
the blame must rest upon Warren
William, who constantly appears to
be a caricature of someone else. His
highly emotional scenes are quite
artificial—no little due, perhaps, to
the difficulty of making a series of
match strikings climactic and force
ful.
But the most tasteless scenes of
the film are those in which Lili
Damita, a capable star in her own
name, is forced to pretend that she
is Greta Garbo. The idea in itself
is vulgar, and Damita—like Warren
—makes her characterization a cari
cature, and not a very good one at
that.
And since it is impossible to make
the material—as it was handled here
—any more than melodrama, par
ticularly since the leading roles are
played solemnly but badly, he re
sult and moral are obvious: it is
dismal stuff, avoid it. —Sandoe
