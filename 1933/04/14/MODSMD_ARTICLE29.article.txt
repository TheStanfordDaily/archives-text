PUBLICITY SIMPLIFIED
Once upon a TIME (April 21),
there was a GIRL (499 left) who
came to Stanford. Among the fa
mous FIVE HUNDRED (Dollars,
please) she took her PLACE (Pa
vilion). She went to all the SOCIAL
FUNCTIONS (One of the best) and
had lots of FUN (You said it). She
liked to DANCE (Tickets here) and
was POPULAR (You bet). She wore
her CLOTHES (Costumes, to you)
WELL (Well, yourself!). On the
FARM (Ranch) .she was a QUEEN
(Address unknown). Life for her
was just one KING (Still a mys
tery) after ANOTHER (Good time).
