The Editor, Sir:
1 think I was not alone in quitting
i the Assembly Hall Wednesday eve
| ning with the very distinct impres
j sion that, whoever of the interesting
i young disputants was entitled to the
I "medaille," the judges did not de
serve any medals at all, and that
i debating at Stanford had, as a result
i of their ratings, received something
|of a setback. I was confirmed in my
I opinion by obiter dicta overheard
j as I passed from the Hall.
| As I have been described as a
I "grand ami de la France," albeit a
good American, and as circumstances
would tend to make me a Stanford
j partisan, I am glad to be able to
I report that I should have been a bit
puzzled as to giving first place to
Smith of Stanford, pro-French pol
- icy, or to Ten Broek of California,
anti-French policy. I should not
i have been the least bit puzzled in
j deciding that the choice lay clearly
j between these two.

It is proverbial that statistics do
not "get across" any too well on the
platform. Perhaps Ten Broek vised
too many. He certainly had his facts
and presented them, in a cogent
manner. Smith is an appealing
speaker, presented forcibly the main
justification for French policy. Ho
might have documented it more
completely with historical matter to
show that the French obsession for
security is not irrational.
The winner is of course a charm
ing and accomplished young woman.
Her effort was very artistic, but
scarcely, one would say, with the
"art that conceals art."

The Editor, Sir:
Mr. Mellinkoff has apparently
made a discovery which every writ
er makes sooner or later: that any
paradox, however ludicrous, can be
effectively supported. In this case,
he has discovered that the worse a

person's manners are, the better his
critical abilities. And by illustrating
this by the behavior of Stanford au
diences at local theatres he no doubt
amply proves his point. Like every
one else, 1 count myself a member
of that intelligent minority he dis
cusses at some length; consequently
I should not be in the least upset by
vocal demonstrations, since they
would affect only pictures I could
not possibly be interested in. But
occasionally at the theatre I feel not
only the annoyance of being unable
to enjoy a picture because of boo
ing, but also the humiliation of
knowing that the intelligent booing
minority (which is always right)
proves me in the wrong. For audi
ences have sat through "The Sign
of the Cross" in spellbound rapture
and vocally condemned "Mata Han"
and "A Bill of Divorcement."
The difficulty is in assuming that
the intelligent people do the booing.
But Mr. Mellinkoff proves f his too
in admirable fashion. For no one
can possibly get any pleasure from
booing, so he boos only as a labor of
love to society. The appearance of
pleasure on the face of such a per

son must come not from his self
conscious superiority, but only from
the pious zeal of working in a noble
cause. Even so, Mr. Mellinkoff
should devise some scheme of reg
ulation for booers, since we must be
certain that only the truly intelli
gent be admitted to their ranks, and
that the vast rabble that only thinks
itself intelligent be properly sup
pressed. Then too, certain critical
canons must be set up, so that there
can be no variation of taste for un
fortunately it happens occasionally
that the intelligent minority is not in
agreement as to the merits of the
picture. In these borderline cases,
as they are handled at present, the
intelligent minority of the intelligent
minority prevents anyone from on
joying the picture.

The Editor, Sir:
Mr. Mellinkoff has apparently
made a discovery which every writ
er makes sooner or later: that any
paradox, however ludicrous, can be
effectively supported. In this case,
he has discovered that the worse a

person's manners are, the better his
critical abilities. And by illustrating
this by the behavior of Stanford au
diences at local theatres he no doubt
amply proves his point. Like every
one else, 1 count myself a member
of that intelligent minority he dis
cusses at some length; consequently
I should not be in the least upset by
vocal demonstrations, since they
would affect only pictures I could
not possibly be interested in. But
occasionally at the theatre I feel not
only the annoyance of being unable
to enjoy a picture because of boo
ing, but also the humiliation of
knowing that the intelligent booing
minority (which is always right)
proves me in the wrong. For audi
ences have sat through "The Sign
of the Cross" in spellbound rapture
and vocally condemned "Mata Han"
and "A Bill of Divorcement."
The difficulty is in assuming that
the intelligent people do the booing.
But Mr. Mellinkoff proves f his too
in admirable fashion. For no one
can possibly get any pleasure from
booing, so he boos only as a labor of
love to society. The appearance of
pleasure on the face of such a per

son must come not from his self
conscious superiority, but only from
the pious zeal of working in a noble
cause. Even so, Mr. Mellinkoff
should devise some scheme of reg
ulation for booers, since we must be
certain that only the truly intelli
gent be admitted to their ranks, and
that the vast rabble that only thinks
itself intelligent be properly sup
pressed. Then too, certain critical
canons must be set up, so that there
can be no variation of taste for un
fortunately it happens occasionally
that the intelligent minority is not in
agreement as to the merits of the
picture. In these borderline cases,
as they are handled at present, the
intelligent minority of the intelligent
minority prevents anyone from on
joying the picture.

Smith of Stanford, pro-French pol

anti-French policy. I should not
i have been the least bit puzzled in

It is proverbial that statistics do
not "get across" any too well on the
platform. Perhaps Ten Broek vised
too many. He certainly had his facts
and presented them, in a cogent

The winner is of course a charm
