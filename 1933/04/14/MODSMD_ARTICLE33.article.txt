The blending of voices by the
Stanford and California Glee Clubs
at yesterday's All University Assem
bly afforded a large audience a pro
gram. of well-executed selections.
The clubs also sang separately, and
two interludes were provided by
Kenneth Sleekier, Farm pianist.
Chairman Almon E. Roth intro
duced the directors, accompanists,
and head officers of each club. The
program was launched as California
Director Eugene Blanchard waved
his baton for the combined groups
to sing "Hail to California." Stan
ford's C. Albert Kulmann then led
them in Stanford's "Alma Mater.
The best sung selection by the com
bined glee clubs was Huhn's "In
victus"; the shading of volume was
perfectly done.
Upon the completion of this group,
the California Glee Club sang their
numbers, "To Arms," by Maunders,
being their best executed presenta
tion.
The Stanford Glee Club then sang
their group, and executed Cadman's
"The Moon Drops Low" with the
greatest skill.
Afterwards the singers were the
guests of the University for lunch
eon at the Union. A.S.S.U. President
Corbus presided as chairman at the
luncheon.
Tryouts for the Stanford Glee Club
will be held next Monday night in
the women's old gj m at 7:45 o'clock,
announced President Dick Van Wa
genen last night.
