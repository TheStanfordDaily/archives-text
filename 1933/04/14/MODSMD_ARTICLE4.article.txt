years, Stanford's Dink Templeton,
the former "boy wonder coach."
faces California in an active capacity
tomorrow after a year's absence due
to sickness.
Christened Ilohert Lyman Tem
pleton some thirty-odd years ago,
Dink grew lip in Palo Alto in the
atmosphere of Stanford traditions,
which was made even more po
tent by the fact that several broth
ers also attended Stanford.
Templeton will go down in Indian
history as one of the greatest ath
letes ever developed by the institu
tion, as well as its most successful
track coach. His first fame in ath
letics came to him as a rugby player
rather than on the track.
Templeton played rugby at Stan-

' ford and was a member of the
i Olympic rugby team of 1920 which
: won the world championship, his
accurate drop kicking being an im
portant factor in the victory.
The first Big Game after the Car-
I dinals' return to American football
in 1919 found Dink at fullback in
Slanford's backfield. Templeton is
known as the greatest kicker ever
! developed on the Pacific Coast. He
I won one California game with a drop
' kick of 45 yards and is credited with
punting the length of the field, on
one occasion when lie kicked from
behind his own goal, the ball coming
to rest on his opponents' 1-yard line.
Wins Track Title
The Indian coach also made a
name for himself in track as a higli
jumper, winning the 1.C.4-A. title in
! 1920. In the Olympic tryouts of the

same year, Templeton was disquali
fied for diving, so he calmly walked
over to the broad jump pit. and won
a place for himself on the team in
that event with one leap. Brutus
Hamilton, present California coach,
was also a member of the team.
After his 1.C.4-A. victory he re
turned to Stanford in 1921 as track
coach. His team lost the Big Meet
of that year, tied 65t0 65Mi the
following year, lost in 1923, and in
1924 started the winning streak that
the Bears have yet to break.
Under the tutelage of Templeton,
the Indians have also won the I.C.
4-A. title three times, 1927, '28, and
'29, and the N.C.A.A. championship
in 1928. Making a name for himself
as a developer of weightmen, he was
appointed to coach the shot putters
of the 1928 Olympic team.
