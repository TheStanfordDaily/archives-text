# Stanford Speedster Uses Dancing To Keep In Trim

"Dancing has helped my running,"
says Frank Lombardi. "Everyone
knows it is a social asset, but few
realize its value to the trackman. It
keeps them nimble and light on
their feet all the year round. I do
a quarter of a mile of dancing at
the Mark or some other place at
least once a week."
