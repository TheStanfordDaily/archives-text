BERKELEY, Cal., Apr. 22 (P.1.P.).
j â€”"Campus appreciation of art has
| reached its greatest height this
i year." So says Professor Ray S.
Boynton of U.C., after ten years on
i the California faculty.
Boynton also says that the gradual
| increase in the "familiarity with art
j breeds not contempt, but a basis for
I criticism." The facetious attitude
J now held by many people toward
| art would disappear rapidly if the
; public could understand u bit about
! the modern tendencies.
j He goes on to say: '"Superficiality
is a defense adopted by those who
are stumped for something to say,
in artistics as well as in other fields.
