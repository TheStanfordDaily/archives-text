An expert is a person whom other ,
persons believe knows more about ,
something than they do. Sometimes I
ho does.
And a sports expert is a person !
whom other persons believe knows |
enough about muscular activity, i
about strategy, and about the
psychological set of competing ath- j
letes to be able correctly to forecast
the results of games and races.
Sometimes the sports expert is
right, and then his forecast is hailed
as u lucid understanding of things; {
sometimes he is wrong, and then his j
forecast is forgotten while he pre
pares the next day's forecast.
Experts differ from scientists be
cause scientists describe phenomena
and the descriptions are facts.
1 am traditionally bound to ex
port today concerning tomorrow's
Big Meet. Instead, I shall attempt
to bo scientific and present facts
rathar than predictions.
"BULLET BOB" MAY
SHOOT IN 440
1 do not know whether Les Ilables
will defeat Bob Kiesel in the dashes
because he is a faster man in better
condition or whether Bob Kiesel
will defeat Les Hables in the dashes
because lie is a faster man in better
condition. 1 do know that six good
splinters will run tomorrow: Hables
end Kiesol; Jimmy Willson, back
M ound !).8; Frank Lombardi, always
best in the Big Meet; Dave Muir of
U.C., second in last year's 220; and
Hudson of U.C.
And I do know that Ilables told
ino yesterday that he felt in the
best condition of his life and
therefore hopes Kiesel will be in
shape worthily to defend his rec
ords of !M> and 21.1 made last
year.
The facts concerning Eastman's
successors in the 440 and 880 are
scanty. I have run against Califor
nia's Van LobenSels, and if he has
i ot improved since then, Stanford's
Ai Blackmail, Art Rice, and Frank
I'ullenwider can sweep the quarter.
And I have been told that Bob Kiesel
may run the 440, and that Califor
nian Lyle Reynolds can beat George
Nay lon and Dan Murphy in the half.
FIVE PERTINENT FACTS
IN TWO EVENTS
Since I refuse to be an expert, I
will say about the distances that
Phil Morentin will run only the two
niilc; that last year's Big Meet win
ner, Ollio Amdahl, will start in that
race, injured leg and all; and that
the experts are contending that
Woody Ketchell of Cal should be
the favorite in the mile.
Facts concerning the hurdles
hardly bear repetition. Cotto Her
bert, a fair hurdler for a couple
of years, now has the identical
good time (2:1.8) as has Coe of
California in the lows, (lus Meier,
who loped through a (light in 15.1
Wednesday after his long layoff,
has been the best and most con
sistent of the high hurdlers.
There are five pertinent facts in
the shot-put and discus, four being
Stanford facts and known variously
; s Here Labordo, Nellie Gray, John
Lyman, and Slinger Dunn. The
Berkeley fact is Dave Meek, whom
Brick Morse admits is in a class
with Brick Morse. Gray, with a re
cently strained back, is a question
able fact but il would be scientific
and not expeitific to suggest that the
Stanford weightmen h;ive better i
distances than the California weight
men.
The broad-jumping facts available
are that Granting of California (the
Little Big Meet record-holder) is
not in good condition, that Phil Wil
liams has exceeded 23 feet in prac
tice but fouled while so doing, and
that Lewis has officially exceeded
23 feet.

Paul Jacques, who has a swell
picture on the third page of this
paper, should be in a fact by him
self among the high-jumpers but
isn't because Lloyd Schween of
Stanford and Meek of California
have been more consistent this sea
son. Captain Jim Miles of California,
like Captain Ben Eastman of Stan
ford. is injured. He will nevertheless
compete in the javelin against his
teammate Waterbury and Johnny
Mottram and Dave Brown of Stan
ford.
I have magnanimously presented
you with facts concerning every |
event except the pole-vault, in |
which Olympic Champion Bill '
Miller has several times exceeded
the Big Meet record.
But there are a couple of other
unassailable Big Meet facts that a j
scientist can mention. There is Big
Meet rivalry, years of it culminating
in the fortieth Big Meet. There is
the Big Meet record book, contain- i
ing marks made by some of the fin- |
e.s. athletes of all time; it is an al- j
ways changing book, and it should !
change tomorrow. There are Brutus
Hamilton, new to Big Meets, and
Dink Tcmpleton, back at Big Meets
; fter his year of invalidism.
Finally, there is the biggest fact 1
of all. One that can stand alone, in I
bold face and caps:

"BULLET BOB" MAY
SHOOT IN 440
1 do not know whether Les Ilables
will defeat Bob Kiesel in the dashes
because he is a faster man in better
condition or whether Bob Kiesel
will defeat Les Hables in the dashes
because lie is a faster man in better
condition. 1 do know that six good
splinters will run tomorrow: Hables
end Kiesol; Jimmy Willson, back
M ound !).8; Frank Lombardi, always
best in the Big Meet; Dave Muir of
U.C., second in last year's 220; and
Hudson of U.C.
And I do know that Ilables told
ino yesterday that he felt in the
best condition of his life and
therefore hopes Kiesel will be in
shape worthily to defend his rec
ords of !M> and 21.1 made last
year.
The facts concerning Eastman's
successors in the 440 and 880 are
scanty. I have run against Califor
nia's Van LobenSels, and if he has
i ot improved since then, Stanford's
Ai Blackmail, Art Rice, and Frank
I'ullenwider can sweep the quarter.
And I have been told that Bob Kiesel
may run the 440, and that Califor
nian Lyle Reynolds can beat George
Nay lon and Dan Murphy in the half.
FIVE PERTINENT FACTS
IN TWO EVENTS
Since I refuse to be an expert, I
will say about the distances that
Phil Morentin will run only the two
niilc; that last year's Big Meet win
ner, Ollio Amdahl, will start in that
race, injured leg and all; and that
the experts are contending that
Woody Ketchell of Cal should be
the favorite in the mile.
Facts concerning the hurdles
hardly bear repetition. Cotto Her
bert, a fair hurdler for a couple
of years, now has the identical
good time (2:1.8) as has Coe of
California in the lows, (lus Meier,
who loped through a (light in 15.1
Wednesday after his long layoff,
has been the best and most con
sistent of the high hurdlers.
There are five pertinent facts in
the shot-put and discus, four being
Stanford facts and known variously
; s Here Labordo, Nellie Gray, John
Lyman, and Slinger Dunn. The
Berkeley fact is Dave Meek, whom
Brick Morse admits is in a class
with Brick Morse. Gray, with a re
cently strained back, is a question
able fact but il would be scientific
and not expeitific to suggest that the
Stanford weightmen h;ive better i
distances than the California weight
men.
The broad-jumping facts available
are that Granting of California (the
Little Big Meet record-holder) is
not in good condition, that Phil Wil
liams has exceeded 23 feet in prac
tice but fouled while so doing, and
that Lewis has officially exceeded
23 feet.
A JUMPING JACQUES

Paul Jacques, who has a swell
picture on the third page of this
paper, should be in a fact by him
self among the high-jumpers but
isn't because Lloyd Schween of
Stanford and Meek of California
have been more consistent this sea
son. Captain Jim Miles of California,
like Captain Ben Eastman of Stan
ford. is injured. He will nevertheless
compete in the javelin against his
teammate Waterbury and Johnny
Mottram and Dave Brown of Stan
ford.
I have magnanimously presented
you with facts concerning every |
event except the pole-vault, in |
which Olympic Champion Bill '
Miller has several times exceeded
the Big Meet record.
But there are a couple of other
unassailable Big Meet facts that a j
scientist can mention. There is Big
Meet rivalry, years of it culminating
in the fortieth Big Meet. There is
the Big Meet record book, contain- i
ing marks made by some of the fin- |
e.s. athletes of all time; it is an al- j
ways changing book, and it should !
change tomorrow. There are Brutus
Hamilton, new to Big Meets, and
Dink Tcmpleton, back at Big Meets
; fter his year of invalidism.
Finally, there is the biggest fact 1
of all. One that can stand alone, in I
bold face and caps:
TIIE BIG MEET. —Strouse
An expert is a person whom other ,
persons believe knows more about ,
something than they do. Sometimes I
ho does.
And a sports expert is a person !
whom other persons believe knows |
enough about muscular activity, i
about strategy, and about the
psychological set of competing ath- j
letes to be able correctly to forecast
the results of games and races.
Sometimes the sports expert is
right, and then his forecast is hailed
as u lucid understanding of things; {
sometimes he is wrong, and then his j
forecast is forgotten while he pre
pares the next day's forecast.

end Kiesol; Jimmy Willson, back
M ound !).8; Frank Lombardi, always
best in the Big Meet; Dave Muir of
U.C., second in last year's 220; and
Hudson of U.C.
And I do know that Ilables told
ino yesterday that he felt in the
best condition of his life and
therefore hopes Kiesel will be in
shape worthily to defend his rec
ords of !M> and 21.1 made last
year.
The facts concerning Eastman's
successors in the 440 and 880 are
scanty. I have run against Califor
nia's Van LobenSels, and if he has
i ot improved since then, Stanford's
Ai Blackmail, Art Rice, and Frank
I'ullenwider can sweep the quarter.
And I have been told that Bob Kiesel
may run the 440, and that Califor
nian Lyle Reynolds can beat George
Nay lon and Dan Murphy in the half.
FIVE PERTINENT FACTS
IN TWO EVENTS
Since I refuse to be an expert, I
will say about the distances that
Phil Morentin will run only the two
niilc; that last year's Big Meet win
ner, Ollio Amdahl, will start in that
race, injured leg and all; and that
the experts are contending that
Woody Ketchell of Cal should be
the favorite in the mile.
Facts concerning the hurdles
hardly bear repetition. Cotto Her
bert, a fair hurdler for a couple
of years, now has the identical
good time (2:1.8) as has Coe of
California in the lows, (lus Meier,
who loped through a (light in 15.1
Wednesday after his long layoff,
has been the best and most con
sistent of the high hurdlers.
There are five pertinent facts in
the shot-put and discus, four being
Stanford facts and known variously
; s Here Labordo, Nellie Gray, John
Lyman, and Slinger Dunn. The
Berkeley fact is Dave Meek, whom
Brick Morse admits is in a class
with Brick Morse. Gray, with a re
cently strained back, is a question
able fact but il would be scientific
and not expeitific to suggest that the
Stanford weightmen h;ive better i
distances than the California weight
men.
The broad-jumping facts available
are that Granting of California (the
Little Big Meet record-holder) is
not in good condition, that Phil Wil
liams has exceeded 23 feet in prac
tice but fouled while so doing, and
that Lewis has officially exceeded
23 feet.

Paul Jacques, who has a swell
picture on the third page of this
paper, should be in a fact by him
self among the high-jumpers but
isn't because Lloyd Schween of
Stanford and Meek of California
have been more consistent this sea
son. Captain Jim Miles of California,
like Captain Ben Eastman of Stan
ford. is injured. He will nevertheless
compete in the javelin against his
teammate Waterbury and Johnny
Mottram and Dave Brown of Stan
ford.
I have magnanimously presented
you with facts concerning every |
event except the pole-vault, in |
which Olympic Champion Bill '
Miller has several times exceeded
the Big Meet record.
But there are a couple of other
unassailable Big Meet facts that a j
scientist can mention. There is Big
Meet rivalry, years of it culminating
in the fortieth Big Meet. There is
the Big Meet record book, contain- i
ing marks made by some of the fin- |
e.s. athletes of all time; it is an al- j
ways changing book, and it should !
change tomorrow. There are Brutus
Hamilton, new to Big Meets, and
Dink Tcmpleton, back at Big Meets
; fter his year of invalidism.
Finally, there is the biggest fact 1
of all. One that can stand alone, in I
bold face and caps:
TIIE BIG MEET. —Strouse
An expert is a person whom other ,
persons believe knows more about ,
something than they do. Sometimes I
ho does.
And a sports expert is a person !
whom other persons believe knows |
enough about muscular activity, i
about strategy, and about the
psychological set of competing ath- j
letes to be able correctly to forecast
the results of games and races.
Sometimes the sports expert is
right, and then his forecast is hailed
as u lucid understanding of things; {
sometimes he is wrong, and then his j
forecast is forgotten while he pre
pares the next day's forecast.
Experts differ from scientists be
cause scientists describe phenomena
and the descriptions are facts.
1 am traditionally bound to ex
port today concerning tomorrow's
Big Meet. Instead, I shall attempt
to bo scientific and present facts
rathar than predictions.
"BULLET BOB" MAY
SHOOT IN 440
1 do not know whether Les Ilables
will defeat Bob Kiesel in the dashes
because he is a faster man in better
condition or whether Bob Kiesel
will defeat Les Hables in the dashes
because lie is a faster man in better
condition. 1 do know that six good
splinters will run tomorrow: Hables
end Kiesol; Jimmy Willson, back
M ound !).8; Frank Lombardi, always
