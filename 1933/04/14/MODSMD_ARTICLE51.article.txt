# Frosh Threaten Six Records In Little Big Meet
## CARDS FAVORED TO BEAT U.C. CUBS IN TODAY'S STRUGGLE 
### John Kline 
With six Little Big Meet records
seemingly destined for oblivion,
Stanford's potent and unconquered
Papoose tracksters face the bellicose
California frosh on Angell Field at
3:10 o'clock this afternoon.
Sports writers persist in observ
ing that the strife will be close
indeed. On the basis of previous
records this would seem scarcely
fair to the Indians. Past perform
ances show the Bear Cubs to be at
least 20 points inferior. Six events
are cinched by Stanford; four by
their opponents, with the remain
ing five all classed as anyone's
race.
In the feature event of the after
noon, Grayson, Moscrip, and Reisner
run into the classy U.C. trio of Dick,
Vallejo, and Hurst. Six names on
paper—but six near 10-flat men on
(he cinder-path. Vallejo has chalked
up the best time, 9.9 seconds, but is
a long way from being consistent at
that speed. Which man responds
quickest to the starter's gun will
have a big bearing on the outcome.
When the distance runners take
their stand, then indeed may all
Stanford men don a wide smile. For
Captain Chuck Nimmo, 128 pounds
of dynamic miles, will set out after
two Little Big Meet records. The
book reads 10:07.8 and 4.29.7 for the
two-mile and mile; Nimmo's times
stand 9:54 and 4:28.6. Slim, striding
legs—and a little mathematics—is
all it takes.
Haskell Leads Vaulting
Transbay supporters will feel
most cheerful when the vaulting
gels under way. Haskell will be
striving to surpass the 12 6% which
stands as the mark. The Califomian
has done 12 feet, 8 inches, and is
fairly consistent at the heights.
Hurdle races will give Indian stock
another jump—of about 16 or 17
points. Kingsbury and Klopstock
will be loping every barrier with
the idea of cutting under the time
of 24.4 which has stood for seven
teen years in the high sticks, and
15.2 in the lows.

Javelin-thrower Fitzgerald lacks
lo date but three inches of giving
Berkeley another record —788 feet,
31/2 inches the tally book reads; and
190 feet Mr. Fitzgerald has his eye
on.
Just outside the record-shattering
class, but event-cinchers still, come
Vallejo of the Cubs, and the Indian
weight-men. The California sprint
er's 22 feet should enable him to
ease into first place in the broad
jump. Reynolds' 44 feet stamps him
by far the best shot-heaver. The dis
cus men vary, but Leedy, Holloway,
Reynolds, Calloway, and Hudson all
outperform their opponents, who

seem unable to pass the 120-foot
mark.
Fitzgerald Throws Javelin
Captain Dick Brace of U.C. is
within a hair's breadth of Nimmo's
class. His 1:59 points to him as the
tape-breaker in the 880. His chief
opponent will be Davis, with a mark
of 2:02 made before vacation.
Bagnassacco Good
The quarter-mile will see a horse
race finish—it may be won by a
nose. Bagnassacco of the Bears, a
52.2 man, is supposed to be the win
ner. But it would be wise to keep
an eye on Del linger of the Papooses.
Last, and far from least, the high
jump appears as another well-tied
up competition, Thompson, from
across the bal, once did 6 feet' \<\
inch. Ever since he has been resting
his luarels, being beaten at 5 feet,
10 inches and sundry heights. Nobs
and Cottrell, two 5-foot-ll men in
their prop days, started feebly at
around 5 feet, 7 inches. As the season
heightened, so did ex-basketballers
Nobs and Cottrell. Both are now
only one inch from six feet, and
figure to add a few points on the
Red side of the ledger.
More college graduates among or
ganized nudists claim Harvard as
their alma mater than any other
institution.
