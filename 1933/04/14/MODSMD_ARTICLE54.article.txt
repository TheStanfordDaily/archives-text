# U. C. DAILY DOPES INDIANS TO TAKE TENTH TRACK WIN
## 
### Daily Californian 
! Editor's Xote.— l : ollmving is the ap
pearancc of the Hit) Meet from over
there nt Berkeley. This story tens writ
ten e.velusn ely for the Doily by the
' "Califoriiioii's" sports staff.
Doped at every conceivable score
except one giving California a vic
i tory, the fortieth California-Stan
ford track meet bids fair to become
i Stanford's tenth -in- a - row. Not
since 1923 have the Bears been able
to scratch together more than 65
' points against the Cards, and to
morrow, unless Brutus Hamilton's
athletes go crazy, the lean years will
become ten.
If Brutus Hamilton loses tomor
row—as he seems fated to—he will
at least have the consolation of
knowing that he has turned out
the best track team to represent
California in a decade. For to
morrow California will score at
least 56 points against Stanford,
and a year from tomorrow it may
well be a case of Stanford figur
ing how many points it can score
against the Bears.
If a total of 56 for California
seems a "Berkeley guess," remem
ber this:
Dave Muir should run second in
the hundred, and should win the
220, with Pat Hudson, his teammate,
I running third.
If reports concerning Sam East
man are true, California's Jim Van
LobenSels and Horace Street will
run second and third, in that order,
in the quarter-mile.
Lyle Reynolds should win the
880, with either Charlie Moore or
Clayton Orr getting a third. If Sam
Eastman is ailing, California may
sweep the event.
U.C. May Take Mile
Woodrow Kitchell, if he lives up
to Hamilton's prediction that he will
run a 4:25 mile tomorrow, will beat
Jim Ferrie. In any event, he will
take a second, while Anderson may
be able to drag a third out of the
fire.
Robert Lee, nursing a sore ankle,
may still be counted upon for a sec
> ond in the two-mile grind. Stan-
I lord is entitled to the other two
places.
The hurdle events find Richard
Coe the lone California threat. He
j should run second to Gus Meier in
the highs, and should win the lows.
In the held events. California is
sadly outclassed. Bill Koblick
ought to place third in the pole
vault. The shot and discus events
can be figured as nothing but a
clean sweep for the Cards. Cali
fornia. with Micelli and Talley
performing, should get second and
third out of the broad jump.
The high jump is the only field
' event, with the exception of the jav
elin, which the Bears can hope to
win. Paul Jacques, who has jumped
I 6 feet two inches this year, should
take a first. Ed Waterbury is Ham
ilton's best offering in the javelin,
since Captain Jim Miles has suffered
a torn shoulder muscle.
And that's how it stands for Cali
fornia, who won't win, .but who will
give Dink Templeton lots to think
about in the near future.

pearancc of the Hit) Meet from over
there nt Berkeley. This story tens writ
ten e.velusn ely for the Doily by the
' "Califoriiioii's" sports staff.
Doped at every conceivable score
except one giving California a vic
i tory, the fortieth California-Stan
ford track meet bids fair to become
i Stanford's tenth -in- a - row. Not
since 1923 have the Bears been able
to scratch together more than 65
' points against the Cards, and to
morrow, unless Brutus Hamilton's
athletes go crazy, the lean years will
become ten.
If Brutus Hamilton loses tomor
row—as he seems fated to—he will
at least have the consolation of
knowing that he has turned out
the best track team to represent
California in a decade. For to
morrow California will score at
least 56 points against Stanford,
and a year from tomorrow it may
well be a case of Stanford figur
ing how many points it can score
against the Bears.
If a total of 56 for California
seems a "Berkeley guess," remem
ber this:
Dave Muir should run second in
the hundred, and should win the
220, with Pat Hudson, his teammate,
I running third.
If reports concerning Sam East
man are true, California's Jim Van
LobenSels and Horace Street will
run second and third, in that order,
in the quarter-mile.
Lyle Reynolds should win the
880, with either Charlie Moore or
Clayton Orr getting a third. If Sam
Eastman is ailing, California may
sweep the event.
U.C. May Take Mile
Woodrow Kitchell, if he lives up
to Hamilton's prediction that he will
run a 4:25 mile tomorrow, will beat
Jim Ferrie. In any event, he will
take a second, while Anderson may
be able to drag a third out of the
fire.
Robert Lee, nursing a sore ankle,
may still be counted upon for a sec
> ond in the two-mile grind. Stan-
I lord is entitled to the other two
places.
The hurdle events find Richard
Coe the lone California threat. He
j should run second to Gus Meier in
the highs, and should win the lows.
In the held events. California is
sadly outclassed. Bill Koblick
ought to place third in the pole
vault. The shot and discus events
can be figured as nothing but a
clean sweep for the Cards. Cali
fornia. with Micelli and Talley
performing, should get second and
third out of the broad jump.
The high jump is the only field
' event, with the exception of the jav
elin, which the Bears can hope to
win. Paul Jacques, who has jumped
I 6 feet two inches this year, should
take a first. Ed Waterbury is Ham
ilton's best offering in the javelin,
since Captain Jim Miles has suffered
a torn shoulder muscle.
And that's how it stands for Cali
fornia, who won't win, .but who will
give Dink Templeton lots to think
about in the near future.
