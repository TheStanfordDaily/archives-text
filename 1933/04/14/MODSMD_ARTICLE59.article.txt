# FUTURE TACKLES HURLING WEIGHTS ON TRACK TEAM
## 
### Bob Letts 
Coach "Tiny" Thornhill expressed
the thought some tyne ago that he
could produce a strong football team
if he could find some tackles. All he
j needs to do is to look over the
weight-throwing departments of the
Stanford varsity and freshman track
squads to solve his worries, in part
at least.
On the varsity are "Here" La
borde, No. 1 discus man and a regu
lar tackle last fall, who has one
season of gridiron competition left,
! and Gordon ("Slinger") Dunn, the
; 240-pound youngster who trans
ferred here from Menlo Junior Col
lege this quarter. Dunn played at
tackle under Dud DeGroot, but he
seldom got mad enough to really
play the game of which he is ca
pable.
Needs Raw Meet
In one game that Dunn played,
he was lined up against a compara
i live "half-pint" who began making
a monkey of the Slinger, and be
fore long the big boy got up enough
dander to lay the opposing squad
all over the turf. All he needs to be
a gridiron terror is an occasional
diet of raw meat.
Johnny Mottram, the quiet lad
who is using his stocky build to
( heave the javelin for Mr. Templeton,
was a member of the Grays .squad
last fall, and should have sufficient
seasoning to put in a serious bid at
either a tackle or guard post. He has
the weight, the attitude, the willing
ness. He would make a good under
study.
Frosh Star in Track
Coming up from the frosh arc
"Cab" Calloway, George Leedy, Bob
Reynolds, and Alf Brandin, all of
whom have scored points in meets
this spring. They were members of
the best frosh eleven ever to play
football here, and will become in
tegral parts of teams-to-be.
On the frosh track are two back
field men who have shown so much
speed in moleskins that they have
decided to convert their interests to
running in the oil seasons. They are
Bobby Grayson and Johnny Reis
| ner. You've heard enough about
them already.
