# MERMEN PRIMED TO CUT SWIM MARKS TOMORROW
## 
### WILLARD BUNGAY 
Stanford aquatic fan*, should
the greatest record-breaking orgy
ever held on the Pacific Coast to
morrow when swimmers from Cali
fornia, St. Mary's, Santa Clara,
S.F.U., San Jose State Teachers Col
lege, and San Francisco State
Teachers College make a combined
assault on the national and Pacific
Coast short course marks in Encina
pools.
Three Indian mermen, Ted
Wiget, Bob Clark, and Captain
Fred Tebbetts are expected to
lower national times in their
events, and every Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate record is almost
certain to be beaten.
Wiget, national quarter-mile and
220-yard champion, covered the 440-
yard course in close to 5 seconds
less than the 20-yard pool time of
4:57.6, in practice yesterday.
Clark, Pacific Coast breaststroke
titleholder, will be out after the Na
tional Intercollegiate 300-yard med
ley record. Clark has been consist
ently swimming under the record
time of 4:08.6 in this event, which
includes 100 yards each of breast
stroke, backstroke, and free-style.
Captain Tebbetts will be offi
cially timed for the first 50 yards
of the 100-yard backstroke race in
which he will attempt to lower
the National A.A.U. 50-yard rec
ord of 29.4 seconds.

In order to try for the national
medley record, Clark will not swim
in the breaststroke race. This event
and a new Coast record will prob
ably go to Dean Langworthy ol
California who has given Clark
strong competition both times they
have met this year. Ken Livingston,
Stanford freshman star, and Houser
and Martin of San Jose State will
provide his chief competition.
The 40-yard free-style race should
be the most exciting event of the
day. With such swimmers as Gordy
Graves and Dick Hirsch of Stanford,
Kenny Bruce of San Jose State, and
Fred Kothe of California, compet
ing over such a short distance, any
one of the four is likely to win
Graves, Pacific Coast Intercolleju -
ate 100-yard champion, should cap
ture this event and establish a nt vv
short-course record. His chief com
petition will come from teamnuio
Hirsch and Kothe of California.
Jim Triolo will be out for a nt ,
record in the 220-yard in whw b
Wiget will not swim.
Morning heats have been changed
from 10 o'clock to 10:30 and final
will be at 2:30 in the afternoon.
Both heats and finals will be opei.
to the public. An admission chargi
of 40 cents will be made for
adults, but students will be ad
niittcd upon presentation of stu
dent body cards.
