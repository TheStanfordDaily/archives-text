# Once Pals—Now Coaching Rivals
## 
### Spud Hamilton 
Two former team mates will meet
again tomorrow and they will sit on
opposite sides of Edwards Field at
California and watch the men they
i have trained so carefully go through
all the throes of a California-Stan
ford Big Meet.
Those teammates are Stanford's
Robert Lyman "Dink" Templeton
and California's Brutus Hamilton,
whose picture appears at the right.
These two were pals together on the
American Olympic team at Antwerp
in 1«J20.
Hamilton was a sophomore at Mis
souri then, and a competitor in the
decathlon, where his specialty was
the pole vault.
Leaps <in Team
Dink was a tow-headed kid from
the West who went to the Olympic
tryouts with the idea of placing in
the high jump, and when they
barred his jumping style, entered

the broad jump, took one leap and
get on the team.
Hamilton was a reserved chap; he
v/as rather studious and did not en
ter into the common horseplay, but
he was extremely popular and man-
to win second place in the
decathlon.
Taught in High School
After graduating Brutus began to j
leach in a high school and diverted
his spare time to coaching the !
school's trackmen; he had such sue- 1
cess that he was recalled to Missouri
University where he developed two !
indoor and two outdoor champion
ship teams.
Probably Hamilton's greatest year
v/as VM2 when his man, "Jarring j
Jim" Bausch, won the decathlon at
Los Angeles with a record point ;
total. Besides Bausch, he had Glen
Cunningham, who is hovering near, 1
and some day ought to break, tho |
rrile record.
