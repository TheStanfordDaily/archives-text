# Bears Have 6 Track Tussles Behind Them
## 
### OLIVER JOHNSTON 
If competition means an advan
[ tage, California should have the
j advantage in the Big Meet. The
Bears have had six duels against
two for the Indians. Stanford en
tered a small team in the P.T.A.
Carnival.
Two reasons stand buck of Stan
ford's academic schedule this sea
son. The first and most important is
the lack of finances, and the second
j is the lack of good competition. In
the past an indoor meet with Wash
-1 ington has been held at Seattle, but
due to the inequality of the two
teams it was not thought worth
while to send the team that far. The
Los Angeles Athletic Club, which
has always furnished Stanford with
| strong competition, found it impos
| sible to put a team in the field this
I season.
i Stanford has been victorious in
i both of its starts, while the Bears
j have survived four out of five.
] Both teams met University of San
\ Francisco in their first meets and
won, Stanford by a score of 107-24
and California by 90',2-40'/is. It
was in this meet that sophomore
Johnny Mottram, heretofore un
heard of, heaved the javelin just
four feet short of the 200 mark.
, Coach Hamilton, not to be out
done, uncovered a sophomore
named Coe. who broke the tape
in both hurdle races. His time of
15.8 and 29.5 were good l>ecausc
i of the fact that he was fighting a
j strong wind.
Next in ljne came the Olympic
Club. The Indians garnered 90 , /2
points to the Club's 40'/a, while
California ran comfortably through
! a 75 2-3-55 1-3 victory. In this meet
Eastman made what may have been
his last attempt this season on his
own quarter-mile record. In the
field events Stanford made its best
performances. Grey's 51 feet 4 inches
in the shot, Laborde's 163 feet 10\\
\ inches in the discus, and Miller's
i vault of 11 feet were all of 1.C.4-A.
calibre. Reynolds, running a 1:58.4
; half was the new find for the Bears
! in the Club duel.
Bears Beat U.C.L.A.
This meet was the last public ap
j pearance of the Indian traeksters in
j dual competition, while California
! went on to meet U.C.L.A., U.S.C.,
I and the All-Stars, uncovering men
j in each meet. In the first mentioned
' duel the Bears won 72 1 / fe-58 1 /2. It was

in this meet that Dave Meek won #
his third Big "C" by tossing the
shot nearly 48 feet.
In their next meet the Bears
showed their competitive spirit and
kept the Trojans below 100 points.
Thus was largely due to Reynolds'
. 1:57.6 in the half, Meeks' put of 48
feet 11 inches in the shot, and Kob
lick's vault of 13 feet ti inches.
Coe (iood Hurdler
By taking second and third in the '
broad jump, Mieclli and Tally pulled
California out with a 65 2-3-65 1-3
victory over the All-Stars. Coe
brought himself up on equal rating
; with best low hurdles on the Coast
by covering the distance in 23.8.
! Hamilton also found a 4:31 miler in
Kitchell to replace the injured Raf
ferty.
Stanford has ihe Big Meet and
two meets with Southern California
! still remaining on the schedule. Cali
fornia ends its schedule with the
Big Meet.

in both hurdle races. His time of
15.8 and 29.5 were good l>ecausc

Next in ljne came the Olympic
Club. The Indians garnered 90 , /2
points to the Club's 40'/a, while
California ran comfortably through
! a 75 2-3-55 1-3 victory. In this meet
Eastman made what may have been
his last attempt this season on his
own quarter-mile record. In the
field events Stanford made its best
performances. Grey's 51 feet 4 inches
in the shot, Laborde's 163 feet 10\\
\ inches in the discus, and Miller's
i vault of 11 feet were all of 1.C.4-A.
calibre. Reynolds, running a 1:58.4

Bears Beat U.C.L.A.
This meet was the last public ap
j pearance of the Indian traeksters in
j dual competition, while California
! went on to meet U.C.L.A., U.S.C.,
I and the All-Stars, uncovering men
j in each meet. In the first mentioned
' duel the Bears won 72 1 / fe-58 1 /2. It was

in this meet that Dave Meek won #
his third Big "C" by tossing the
shot nearly 48 feet.
In their next meet the Bears
showed their competitive spirit and
kept the Trojans below 100 points.
Thus was largely due to Reynolds'
. 1:57.6 in the half, Meeks' put of 48
feet 11 inches in the shot, and Kob
lick's vault of 13 feet ti inches.
Coe (iood Hurdler
By taking second and third in the '
broad jump, Mieclli and Tally pulled
California out with a 65 2-3-65 1-3
victory over the All-Stars. Coe
brought himself up on equal rating
; with best low hurdles on the Coast
by covering the distance in 23.8.
! Hamilton also found a 4:31 miler in
Kitchell to replace the injured Raf
ferty.
Stanford has ihe Big Meet and
two meets with Southern California
! still remaining on the schedule. Cali
fornia ends its schedule with the
Big Meet.
If competition means an advan

j advantage in the Big Meet. The
Bears have had six duels against
two for the Indians. Stanford en
tered a small team in the P.T.A.
Carnival.
Two reasons stand buck of Stan
ford's academic schedule this sea
son. The first and most important is
the lack of finances, and the second
j is the lack of good competition. In
the past an indoor meet with Wash
-1 ington has been held at Seattle, but
due to the inequality of the two
teams it was not thought worth
while to send the team that far. The
Los Angeles Athletic Club, which
has always furnished Stanford with
| strong competition, found it impos

I season.
i Stanford has been victorious in
i both of its starts, while the Bears
j have survived four out of five.
] Both teams met University of San
\ Francisco in their first meets and
won, Stanford by a score of 107-24
