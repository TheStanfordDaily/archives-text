# Quad Editor Promises Delivery Early In May
## 
### 
Beautifully printed on ivory and
India-colored stock, using not a line
of poetry but crowded full of action
photography, presenting dozens of
campus scenes done realistically by
able artists, the 1933 Quad is prom
ised for early delivery next month
by Ray Hanson, editor.
Part of the book is already off
the press, Hanson said, and woik on
the rest is rapidly nearing comple
tion, days ahead of schedule.
( Chief among special features of

the edition is the extension of the
"Life" section—photos of the year's
activities—to include more than a
dozen more pages that ever before.
The pictures, taken and assembled
under the direction of Georgo
Waters, present a record of almost
everything that has happened to
anyone on the campus since October
1, Hanson said. Waters is known as
one of the best camera artists on the
Coast, and his work alone makes the
book worth while.
