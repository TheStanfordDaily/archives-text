# A.A.U. Head Challenges P.A.A. Measure System
## 
### 
Decision of the Pacific Athletic
Association to conduct the annual
PAA. track and field meet under
the familiar standard of measure
ments in yards and feet was chal- 1
lenged Saturday by Daniel J. Fer
ris, secretary of the AA.U.
The AA.U., parent organization
of the Pacific group, has this year
adopted the international metric sys
tem as standard.
Dink Templeton of Stanford ex- 1
pressed doubt that the PAA. would ,
depart from the standard set by the |
governing body. If it should, any i
new time or mark made at its meet '
would be as readily accepted under \
either system of measurement, Tern- i
pleton said.
