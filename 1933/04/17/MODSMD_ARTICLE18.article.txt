## 
### 
As a preliminary step to testing
the legality of 3.2 beer in Palo Alto
city limits, Judge John E. Springer
ruled Friday that "near beer, con
lining not more than one-half of
one per cent alcohol by eolume is
i not an alcoholic or malt liquor, ac
cording to the city's charter."
The decision came as the result of
a complaint filed against Henry

ing near beer in violation of the
city's laws.
