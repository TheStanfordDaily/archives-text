# Dink Thinks Cards Have Good Chance For Win Over S.C.
## Indian Track Team Shows Ability to Come Through at U.C. Meet with Williams, Lewis, Mottram, Hables, Al Blackman Leading Parade 
### SPUD HAMILTON 
By jolting the California Hear in the midriff with a !)5-to-3ti Big Meet
j victory, Stanford's track and field men Saturday announced to the U.S.C.
Trojans that the temporary enforced retirement of Ben Eastman is not
frightening the Cardinal hand into submission before the advance of
! Dean Cromwell's men this coming week-end. Dink Templeton, Stanford
| coach, said in effect: "We've got a IiOOD team, and one that U.S.C. will
have to work hard on to beat. If every man comes through as he did
, against California, we have a good chance to win."
That preceding sentence adequately sums up the blister of the Berkeley
Bear Saturday. In every case where the issue was in doubt, a Stanford

'"man came through to do his best.
The resulting wide margin of victory
came unexpectedly to the most op
timistic Stanfordite.
Williams, Mottram Surprise
Prominent among those who
; ' came through" were Williams and
I Lewis in the broad-jump, who both
exceeded 23 feet for their first time
in competition, and Johnny Mottram,
who released a 200-foot, 11-inch
javelin throw that traveled nearly
ten feet farther than his previous
I best.
We ought to mention Les Hables,
who is now getting the breaks lie
has deserved these many years.
Les was away and clearly the best
in the field Saturday.
And A1 Blackmail, the sophomore
who came through to stamp out any
U.C. threat in the 440, and who
i again in the relay, when faced with
a heartbreaking task of making up
i four yards against Miller in the an
chor of the relay, did so.
Herbert Suffers
Two gripes: the officials who
picked Coe and Herbert in a tie for
second place in the high hurdles
where Herbert was the best by two
feet; the construction of the pols
; vault which by its mental hazard
may have prevented Miller and Dea
con from clearing 14 feet.

By jolting the California Hear in the midriff with a !)5-to-3ti Big Meet
j victory, Stanford's track and field men Saturday announced to the U.S.C.
Trojans that the temporary enforced retirement of Ben Eastman is not
frightening the Cardinal hand into submission before the advance of
! Dean Cromwell's men this coming week-end. Dink Templeton, Stanford
| coach, said in effect: "We've got a IiOOD team, and one that U.S.C. will
have to work hard on to beat. If every man comes through as he did
, against California, we have a good chance to win."
That preceding sentence adequately sums up the blister of the Berkeley
Bear Saturday. In every case where the issue was in doubt, a Stanford

'"man came through to do his best.
The resulting wide margin of victory
came unexpectedly to the most op
timistic Stanfordite.
Williams, Mottram Surprise
Prominent among those who
; ' came through" were Williams and
I Lewis in the broad-jump, who both
exceeded 23 feet for their first time
in competition, and Johnny Mottram,
who released a 200-foot, 11-inch
javelin throw that traveled nearly
ten feet farther than his previous
I best.
We ought to mention Les Hables,
who is now getting the breaks lie
has deserved these many years.
Les was away and clearly the best
in the field Saturday.
And A1 Blackmail, the sophomore
who came through to stamp out any
U.C. threat in the 440, and who
i again in the relay, when faced with
a heartbreaking task of making up
i four yards against Miller in the an
chor of the relay, did so.
Herbert Suffers

picked Coe and Herbert in a tie for

where Herbert was the best by two
feet; the construction of the pols
; vault which by its mental hazard
may have prevented Miller and Dea

By jolting the California Hear in the midriff with a !)5-to-3ti Big Meet
j victory, Stanford's track and field men Saturday announced to the U.S.C.
Trojans that the temporary enforced retirement of Ben Eastman is not
frightening the Cardinal hand into submission before the advance of
! Dean Cromwell's men this coming week-end. Dink Templeton, Stanford
| coach, said in effect: "We've got a IiOOD team, and one that U.S.C. will
have to work hard on to beat. If every man comes through as he did
, against California, we have a good chance to win."
That preceding sentence adequately sums up the blister of the Berkeley
Bear Saturday. In every case where the issue was in doubt, a Stanford

'"man came through to do his best.
The resulting wide margin of victory
came unexpectedly to the most op
timistic Stanfordite.
Williams, Mottram Surprise
Prominent among those who
; ' came through" were Williams and
I Lewis in the broad-jump, who both
exceeded 23 feet for their first time
in competition, and Johnny Mottram,
who released a 200-foot, 11-inch
javelin throw that traveled nearly
ten feet farther than his previous
I best.
We ought to mention Les Hables,
who is now getting the breaks lie
has deserved these many years.
Les was away and clearly the best
in the field Saturday.
And A1 Blackmail, the sophomore
who came through to stamp out any
U.C. threat in the 440, and who
i again in the relay, when faced with
a heartbreaking task of making up
i four yards against Miller in the an
chor of the relay, did so.
Herbert Suffers
Two gripes: the officials who
picked Coe and Herbert in a tie for
second place in the high hurdles
where Herbert was the best by two
feet; the construction of the pols
; vault which by its mental hazard
may have prevented Miller and Dea
con from clearing 14 feet.
