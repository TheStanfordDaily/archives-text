# Can Palo Alto's Judiciary Prove That Two and Two Are Five?
## 
### 
The first skirmish in the attack by Palo Alto merchants
on the town's liquor laws met (Ideal in the court of Judge
.John K. Sprijiger, Friday. In ;i ruling, as farcical as it was
inevitable, the judge declared thai "near beer, containing
not more than one-half of one per cent of alcohol by vol
ume, is not an alcoholic liquor."
The lest nase was brought for the obvious purpose of
proving that the sale of near beer had already practically
invalidated the law. It was merely a step in the direction
of repealing Palo Alto's "dry" ordinances. The repeal
movement has a long, hard battle ahead and it is obvious
that-every sort of obstruction, from comical court orders
to W.C.T.r. boycotts, is going to be thrown in its wav.
.lust how Judge Springer arrived at the conclusion that
a drink v containing alcohol is not alcoholic is difficult to
see. Ilis reasoning will be still more illogical when he de
clares, as he is bound to soon, that the new .'1.2 beer is
alcoholic.
Some explanation of the judge's verdict may be found,
however, in the fact that the court room was crowded with
women who made no secret of the fact that they stood on
the dry side of the fence. Women, we are told, are not to
be denied.
Then again Judge Springer may have felt the verdict
was necessary to save the city's face. It would be rather
a blow to the court and tlie police to find suddenly that one
of Palo Alto's laws had been broken daily, directly under
their noses.
All in all the best thing that may be said about the
ruling is that it is extremely illogical. Hut then perhaps
science is wrong. II mav be that the local court can prove
that two and two are five.
