# Another Anti-Vivisection Bill Strikes at Stanford's Medical School
## 
### 
I' 11 dor consideration this week by a committee of the
State Assembly is another of the anti-vivisection bills
which periodically crop up among state legislators. Anti
vivisection bills, like the majority of "anti" bills aiming at
the reform of various facets of modern life, could be dis
regarded on this campus, if they did not strike at an impor
tant function of the t'niversity's second largest school.
The School of Medicine, with the allied departments of
anatomy, physiology, psychology, and zoology, needs the
bodies of stray animals to pursue studies of aid to human
ity. This function is expressly forbidden bv the proposed
law even if it is solely for the alleviation of disease and
the promotion of the public welfare.
Such zealous humanilarianism on tlie part of anti-vivi-!
seclionists would be admirable if il were not so obviously!
misplaced. The painless anesthesia of stray animals calls
for less protest than the malnutrition and disease of lower
class children.
Kor the sake of the studies which vivisection allows the j
I Diversity's medical school to pursue, it is hoped that this
latest drive against the practice will meet with unfavorable !
action bv the Assembly.
