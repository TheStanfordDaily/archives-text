# "President's Day" Makes Good Publicity for Hearst, Rolph and Their Ilk
## 
### 
We have become used, in this country, to a never-end
ing stream of special "days" and "weeks." They are of
every sort "Fresh Bread Day," "Flower Week," and
"Home Buying Week" are three of the latest. These, like
almost all of the others, are easily seen to he publicity
campaigns for the purpose of selling some definite product.
The latest and perhaps the worst "day" to he foisted on
the American people is not so easy to classify. This is the !
"President's Day," sponsored by the Hearst newspapers, to
he celebrated Sunday, April 20. So far the movement has
found its chief exponents in men of the caliber of Governor
Holph and Mayor Rossi; both have always fell strongly the
need of joining every popular, and therefore vote-getting,
movement.
From the standpoint of Hearst the probable reasoning!
for the movement is obvious. It is only natural, first of all,
to put aside any chance that the action might be unselfish.
Hearst helped to elect Roosevelt and hoped to run him, but
the President, with public feeling strongly behind him, has
deviated a good deal from most of the publisher's policies.
And the latter has found it to his own best interests to get
in step. The pressure of public opinion is exceedingly
potent both in circulation and advertising.
President Roosevelt is entitled to all the moral and ma
il rial help possible at a time when he is endeavoring to i
put the country on its feet, but there is certainly no need for
the setting aside of a special "day." This is particularly
true when such a "day" is used as publicity for a news- I
paper string and demagogic politicians.
