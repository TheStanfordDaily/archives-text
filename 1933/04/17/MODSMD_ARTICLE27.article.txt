# BULL SESSION
## GOLDEN GATE IS ONLY BRASS 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
In 1933, we are told that thus is
' the day of the great enlightenment.
And in San Francisco, we are told
that San Francisco is the City That
Knows How. Both statements are
contradicted by California Senate
. Bill No. 674. This little gem of legis
lative feeble-mindedness provides
for the comfort of stray dogs and
cats at the expense of research.
We would expect such inanity to
come from the "Cow Counties" —
where people still drive Model T's.
But. no, Senator Fellom of San Fran
cisco is the proud father of the bill.
The measure would prevent Stan
ford and other schools from pur
chasing dogs and cats from city
i pounds. Furthermore, elaborate ar
rangements are made for the com
! fort of the animals. There is not
5
; only to be pure water and food in
: the pounds—but clean bedding, sani
tary conditions and segregation as
\ to specie and sex. How does Senator
' Fellom know that, the dogs wish to
| be so segregated? From what I know
:of dogs, they would object most
I strenuously. There is a beautiful
friendship next door between a
Scotch terrier and an Irish setter.
And I strongly suspect more than a
platonic interest.

| psychology, physiology, and bac
teriology will either cease or Stan
ford will be forced into the dog
growing business.
The expense of growing their own
dogs would add to the present ani
mal expenditure by several hun
dred per cent—not to mention the I
added inconvenience. .The bill is a
direct blow to- research at every
university within the state. It is
unthinkable that with all the prac
tical discoveries that have been j
made in recent years by the medical
sciences, enough people could be
mustered to jam this bill through
our State Senate. The House must
show that it is not fettered to blind
"ignorance and ancient stupidity by
killing the bill.

It was only a relatively short time !
ago that medical students were
forced to midnight graveyard ex
cursions to procure dead bodies in
dispensable to their work. If this
bill passes, it. is safe to say, science
will not close shop. Students will
be forced to spend hours in the
lowly art of dog-snatching. Honest
study should not be penalized to
satisfy the perverted sensibilities of
some cranks.
Vivisection, of course, is a mis
nomer in that all animals are thor
oughly etherized before operation.
They feel nothing. But even ii they
did, one discovery like diphtheria
| anti-toxin is worth all the dogs in 1
the world—even the Scotch terrier |
i next door.

Of course the bill is being spon
sored by so-called humane groups
to prevent experimentation with dogs
and cats. Practically the only source
of animals is the pounds and this
bill seeks to cut that off. If the bill
passes the House and Hizzonnor
Rolph signs, experimentation in
