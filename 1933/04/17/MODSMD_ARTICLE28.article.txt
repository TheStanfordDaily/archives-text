ALICE IN WONDERLAND (Car
roll) at the Columbia Theatre. (To
be repeated Friday and Saturday
matinee and night.)
Here in this Reginald Travel's
; production are found in gala array
all the characters of the delightful
Lewis Carroll book, and they romp
over the stage with utmost aban
don, effectively imparting the non
sense contained in the well-loved
original. The costumes are, on the
whole, admirable reproductions of
the perennial Tenniel drawings;
credit to Alberta Martin.
But to the person who regards
1 "Alice" as almost a bible of non
sense—unlike anything else in liter
! ature—this performance may be
disappointing in one respect. For
purposes of the stage it was obvi
■ ously necessary to concentrate the
; action in a minimum of settings, and
| if possible to give a maximum of
i continuity to what is naturally an
I episodic narrative. The adapters
have done both of these things, and
most effectively, too. And the re
! suit will be enjoyed by all but the
most sensitive devotees of Carroll's
j original. But I can hardly reconcile
the sight of the White Rabbit re
citing the lobster quadrille in front
of the Queen of Hearts, with the
| Red Queen chiming in.
, "Alice in Wonderland" and
I "Through the Looking-Glass" have
j been combined and the favorite
I characters from both are personified,
I many of them precisely as one has
j always imagined them.
| My favorite was the Red Queen,
S played by Peggy Bethers, who was
j splendid in every move, in gesture,
| and in voice pitch; she was given
I some of the White Queen's lines—
on the whole an advantageous
j change.
Emma Knox's Alice left nothing
to be desired, in appearance, in act
ing, or in charm. Her difficult task

! handled.
Kathleen Sherman as the White
Rabbit performed all sorts of func
i tions not in the original, and was
j wholly delightful; she was probably
| the favorite of the juvenile portion
, of the audience. Edwin M;ix as the
j Queen of Hearts thundered excel
lently, and Peter Hester was an ef
fective Hatter. Howard Hein was

somewhat stiff as the March Hare,
while Robert Green was a rather
large Doormouse.
The rest of the characters—and
they are all here—were well im
personated, and it was a real treat
to see recreated the mad beings of
"Alice in Wonderland." • —Chapin

TOURING UTOPlA—Frances Ther
esa Russell (At the Stanford
Bookstore).
Notable for its thoroughness of
treatment and whimsical style, Dr.
Russell's new book offers an inter
esting review of Utopias in general.
The treatment is light Insofar as
this "Mugwumpian Utopographer,"
as she styles herself, refuses to be
.stuffily academic. All Utopias to
date have been surveyed with some
detail by Dr. Russell. She has even
provided us with a map depicting
"The Empyreal View of the Utopian
Realm," the slightly utopistic con
ceptions being located at the out
side of this region, with the more
Utopian Utopias grouped in the cen
ter of the hub.
Though the writer holds no brief
for any one Utopia, she does evalu
ate and comment wisely as she goes
along. "To be an Utopian," as she
puts it, "is at the worst guileless
eccentricity." Her final exhortation
is for us all to strive to convert
Utopia, no place, into Eutopia, the
Good Place, while pointing out that
a multitude of random guesses may
sometime provide the light answer.
"To be a Utopian is an urgent ne
cessity if our wobbling old world is
to be made simply safe."
The bibliographical note is re
markably complete and under the
various headings such as "Satiric
Utopias and Utopistic Satires," or
"Specimens from the Suburbs (giv
ing honorable mention for their
slightly utopistic elements)" is eas
ily referred to.
The book will, of course, be valu

able chiefly to students, but the
general reader will find it a com
plete and entertaining digest of the
works of those writers who have
endeavored to improve on Dr.
Pangloss' "Best of all possible
worlds."
From Plato to the younger Hux
leys. Dr. Russell's outlines are com
plete, and her own wise, sometimes
mischievous comment adds greatly
both to the educational and thera
peutic value of the books.
