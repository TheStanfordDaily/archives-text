ON THE OTHER HAND—
The Editor, Sir:
I beg leave to comment upon Mr.
Bainbridge Cowell's article concern
ing the Joffre Debate, appearing in
Thursday's Daily. Mr. Cowell
"would not have been the least bit
puzzled" in rendering a just deci
sion. If this is so, surely he is a
most remarkable man, for, after
canvassing the judges, members of
the faculty, and fellow students, I
can find nothing even remotely ap
proximating unanimity of opinion.
As so often is the case, there were
more victors than there were places:
certainly, Miss Morris, Messrs. Ban
nister, Smith, and Ten Brock de
serve congratulations for their fin
ished expositions of a very difficult
and complex subject. The judges, in
casting at least one first-place vote
for each of them, indicated that the
honors were fairly well distributed.
Miss Morris, in my humble opin
ion, was deserving of the final ver
dict. In preceding Joffre debates,
she had twice proven her ability in
receiving second places. In this last
debate, no judge placed her lower
than second. Her treatment of the
subject was masterly, and the de
cision signalized her attainment of
the heights of successful public
speaking, for which she has striven
so valiantly.
Every man is entitled to his own
opinion, of course, but Mr. Cowell's
unjustified attack of the judges was
a display of poor sportsmanship, en
tirely unwarranted. These judges.
Mrs. J. Spencer Hall, Messrs. John
L. McNab, H. A. Shuder, Lester
Morse, and Dr. H. A. Stanger, are
prominent representatives of suc
cessful social and professional
groups. Both Califox-nia and Stan
ford should be deeply indebted to
them for their generous sacrifices of
time and energy which they made
in order to attend. The forensic ad
visers of both universities selected
and approved these men, agreeing
to abide by their combined verdicts.
Mr. Cowell's derogatory and un
grateful remarks are decidedly vio
lations of debating ethics and not
in the least consistent with that
spirit of fairness upon which we
Stanfordites pride ourselves.
Sincerely, Jack King
