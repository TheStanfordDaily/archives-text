and his arms pumping and his little
steps eating up cinders .... Game
Ollie Amdahl running seven and
one-half laps on a sore leg, nerve,
and desire.

eating his birthday cake on Friday |

ball game .... The crowd watching j
the ball game from the top of Ed- j

mile or to try and distinguish the j
second-place winner in the 440.
