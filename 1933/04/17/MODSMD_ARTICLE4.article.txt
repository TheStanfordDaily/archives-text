# A.W.S. Must Re-nominate
## Constitutional Obscurities Necessitates Move 
### 
Due to obscurities in th - * A.W.S.
Constitution, as to the time at which
the polls open and the mannt.' in
which declinations are made, De t n
Kirkwood gave, as his opinion, last
Friday, that the nominations for
A.W.S. President held last Thursday
were illegal.
Nominations Thursday
This necessitates new nominations
next Thursday, April 20, and voting
on the following Tuesday, April 26.
A special session of Women's Con
ference hiis been called for 1:15
o'clock on Monday to enact legisla
tion for this postponement, and to
revise the general nomination pro
cedure.
According to Mary-K. Morris,
president of A.W.S., "It is probable
that for several years, in the strict
sense of the word, A.W.S. nomina
tions have been illegal, but it has
never before come to light. The
postponement will not work any
hardship on the women, inasmuch
as the installation of new officers is
not scheduled to take place until the
second week of May. On the other
hand, a constitutional weakness has
been revealed which will be cor
rected at once."
