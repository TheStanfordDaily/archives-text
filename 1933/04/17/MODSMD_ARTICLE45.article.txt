# LAGUNITA TO BE SITE OF JUNIOR WATER CARNIVAL
## 
### Gray Creveling 
The return of the Junior Water
Carnival features this week's "Back
To The Farm" movement at 1
o'clock Friday afternoon on Lake
Lagunita.
The last aquatic festival sponsored
by the Junior Class was held in 1928,
the five-year absence of the carnival
! being due to the fact that the lake
waters were not high enough for
the holding of a successful festival.
The history of these carnivals
shows that they were often varied as
to the nature of the events held, and
that the chairmen of the various
carnival committees occasionally
went mad in their search for some
thing to feature on their program.
Back in .1923, the carnival was
held at night on Lagunita. The moon
and huge arc lights were used to
i illuminate the waters for the occa
sion; and with no section of the lake
lacking in light, this festival was
truly resplendent.
Chairman Dan Ellis of this year's
committee has planned swimming,
races for men and women, canoe
tilting between hall and row men,
and other events.
Entry blanks will be sent out to"
various campus organizations by the
committee before Wednesday.
