# INDIANS TIE GAME, LOSE ONE TO ARIZONA POLOISTS
## 
### 
Led by hard-riding Captain Pete
Gdlham, Stanford's Redshirts came
through with some of the best polo
ever seen here last Friday to tie the
University of Arizona 4 to 4, only
to lose their stride long enough Sat
urday for the Wildcats to rap out a
7-2 victory.
Besides scoring three goals and
playing a bang-up all-around game,
Gillham proceeded to pull the first
contest out of the fire in thw final
minutes of play with a difficult,
slanting shot that went in only after
glancing against a post. '
After Arizona had scored six goals
in the second and third chukkers of
Saturday's game, Stanford's poloists
tightened up in the' final three
periods and outseored the visiting
quartet. Luppe Luppc.n, he of the
alliterative name, was the leader of
this last-half rally with Pat Robb,

suljstituing at number two, putting
through the two goals.
,Luppe Luppen, Woody Melone,
Pvte Gillham, and Johnny Myers
started bolh games for Stanford,
with Gregg Hathaway, Ducky Clark,
Jack Budlong, and Nelson Brown
playing for Ari ona. Kemp Maor and
Pat Robb both saw service for the
Indians in the closing chukkers of
Saturday's game.
