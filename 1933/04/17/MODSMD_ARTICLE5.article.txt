# 'Hawk Island' In New Vein
## 
### 
"Hawk Island," ihe new spring
! play, will be the first murder mys
; tery to be offered to Stanford audi
j ences in nearly three years, and
! every effort is being made to make
| this a memorable opus.
In December 1929 "Cock Robin,"
by Elmer Rice and Philip Barry, was
presented as the annual sophomore
play. The Rice-Barry play is more
! for an amateur cast., as it is a play
j about amateurs, and in it are found
far less comedy and less sophistica
j tion than in "Hawk Island."
Under the direction of Gordon
Davis were presented several mys
teries, none of so pronounced a mys
tery as "Hawk Island." "The Haunt
ed House" came in December of
1928, with Katherine Keho and Joe
: Thompson achieving early fame.
Others, still earlier, were "In the
Next Room," a straight mystery
story, and "Not Herbert," a mystery
farce.
