Sprint Champ
Featuring Phil Daubenspek at
sprint, the L.A.A.C. team is com
posed entirely of stars of other
clubs, who banded together lo in
sure a "Los Angeles team lor the
Los Angeles Olympics." Daubenspek
was the hist 50-yard sprint, cham
pion before the A.A.U. abolished
this title and is the biggest scoring
threat of the forward wall.
Three former Stanford stars will
be playing with the club team. They
are Walter O'Connor, forward, Cal
Strong, Card captain in 1928, guard,
and Dutch McAllister, captain in
1925, as centerbaek.
Clapp Absent
Austin Clapp, last year's star for
ward, played with the team at the
Olympics but will not take part in
this series. His place will probably
be taken by Frank Walton. Other
club players include Charles Finn,
guard, and Herbie Wildman, sensa
tional Venice high-school flash, at
goal guard.
Stanford's record this season has
been impressive. The Indians easily
won the Northern California Water
Polo League title and coasted to the
Intercollegiate championship at the
Minor Sports Carnival. However,
they will be distinctly the underdogs
in. this series its the L.A.A.C. team
not only has a great reputation, but
has practiced together for three
years, whereas three members of
Coach Thornton's starting lineup are
sophomores.
