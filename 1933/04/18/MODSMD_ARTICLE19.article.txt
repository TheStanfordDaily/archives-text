# SENATE DEFEATS SILVER COINAGE ON F.B.'S WORD
## Roosevelt Crushes Money Bill To Aid Farmer By Currency Inflation 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 17 UV) â€”
A soft-spoken word from the White
House today crushed in defeat Sen
ate advocates of monetary inflation
as a means of aiding the farmer.
Their proposal to add remonetiza
tion of silver to President Roose
velt's far-reaching agricultural relief
bill was defeated 43 to 33.
Amid Bryanesque echoes of the
turbulent '96 campaign, the Senate
resounded all afternoon to a cry for
free coinage of the white metal at
16 to 1 with gold, sponsored by
Senator Wheeler and urged by
others.
Opposes Inflation
The Chief Executive's opposition
to making currency inflation part of
the farm program was considered
by many Senators the decisive fac
tor in defeating the silver amend
ment. Opponents were amazed by
the strength shown for it and said
several who favored inflation voted
against it only because Mr. Roose
velt did not want it added to the
agriculture bill.
A moment before the vote, Sen
ator Robinson of Arkansas, the
Democratic leader and only op
ponent to speak, informed Senator
Borah: "'The President does not
desire" the amendment. Borah had
said he would vote against it if
the President disapproved.
The Idahoan had been insisting
that only through expansion of the
currency could commodity prices be
lifted, the depression conquered, and
the farmer's income restored. He
contended farm relief and inflation
went hand in hand.
Undaunted by this setback, but
cheered by the gain from last Janu
ary, when his silver plan was de
feated 56 to 18, Wheeler announced
off the floor he would press it sep
arately later on. Meanwhile Thomas
brought formally before the Senate
another inflation plan.
