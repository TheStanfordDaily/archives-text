### FRANCES AYRES 
"Beginning ;i( about seven min
utes past five this morning, the
greatest earthquake of modern
times, shook the campus,'' wrote the
Daily Palo Alto on April 18, 1!)06.
Today many of the Stanford fac
ulty reminisce on the most exciting
diiy in their undergraduate career.
'"I remember that the first thing
my roommate and I did," said Phys
ics Professor P. A. Ross, who was
then a junior student, "was to look
toward Stanford from our College
Terrace house. When we saw that
the familiar landmark, the 190-foot
steeple on the church, had disap
peared, we had some conception of
the disaster."
Ross describes the scene that he
found at the University. "The new
gym and library were completely
wrecked. The east side of the Phys
ics building was down and the
Geology building was gone. The
English department looked like a
doll's house with exterior exposed."
Professor Ralph H. Lutz was one

of the senior students who received
A.B.'s without benefit of final exam
inations or graduation, when Presi
dent David Starr Jordan closed the
University shortly after the earth
quake. Lutz recalls a meeting with
William James, Harvard psychologist,
who was visiting Stanford at the
time, and remembers his detached,
impersonal manner.
Alice Hays, reference librarian,
remarked upon the terrifying ru
mors which circulated about the
campus. "We heard that the San
Francisco underworld was fleeing
the fire and was coming our way."
Another current rumor was that
escaped lunatics from Agnew were
headed toward Palo Alto.
John E. McDowell, Alumni secre
tary, who was assistant registrar in
1906, said that at the time >>f the
quake there were 178(5 students in
Stanford. The; following fall the
registration dropped to 1668. Only
one student life was lost in the dis
aster.
