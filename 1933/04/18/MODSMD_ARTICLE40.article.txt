# Must- a Refreshing Pause Cost Ten Cents at the Union?
## 
### 
It's been ;i long lime since (lie Daily has picked a light
with the Stanford Union, principally because the Union
lias been prettv cordial ;in<l hospitable to student trade.
And this is no time to start such a light, even though the
Union is breaking the spirit of the law by selling near
beer. The Union can't help it if the powers-lhat-be sav
"no beer" either. As a matter of fact, the local soda-jerkers
have been pretty decent, what with cutting prices on last
minute pastries and everything.
.lust the same a lot of customers are kicking, not be
cause the service is any worse than they expect or the food
any less tasty, but because the Union charges them live
cents to sit down and lean back. Sit at the counter and
order a coke, ami the charge is live cents. Hut sit in a booth
and order an identical drink, and the tariff is ten cents.
And there's the rub with a sizeable number of Union pa-
Irons, at the point where their backs touch the booth par
tition.
The point of whether or not there is an economic justi
fication for this variance in price readily becomes lost in
the niaze of Union bookkeeping. The dissatisfied customer
can only judge by comparisons. Thereby he discovers that
there is no extra charge for silting in relative comfort al
any of the popular soft-drink dispensaries in Palo Alto.
Of course the Union doesn't have to be concerned with
where students sit to drink cokes in Palo Alio or how much
they are charged for silling there, for the campus fountain
is operating on a monopoly or near-monopolv basis, and
knows it. Hul even a monopolistic instituilon has lo cast
an eye toward the good-will of the patronage, claims com
mon sense economies. The Daily rallies to the cause of
nickel-drink Union customers to recommend the abolition
of the ten cent minimum charge for booth service.
