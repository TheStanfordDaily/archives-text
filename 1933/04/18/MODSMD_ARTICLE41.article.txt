# Gentlemanly Demeanor? Or Only Lack of Enterprise?
## 
### 
The I'niversily of California was the scene, Friday, of
an unfortunate incident. I'ndoubtedly the majority of tin 4
Berkeley sludeut-hody regrets the acilon taken by a small
group of individualists, in front of Sather (late when the
[>latoon of visiting Japanese midshipmen came marching
by on a lour of the university. The demonstration was
ended, il may he remembered, by the calling out of the
police reserves.
Lending added significance to tin 1 incident is the pas
sage yesterday bv the House of President's arms embargo
empowering act; the bill, which is vet to receive the Sen
ate's approval, is obviously aimed at Japan, the major
"warring nation" of the present.
It is with regret that the unmannerly reception of the
Japanese representatives must be observed; it is with pleas
ure that their cordial welcome at this University is chron
icled.
The difference in the two receptions may be laid to the
more gentlemanly demeanor at all times, at all places
of the Stanford student over the California. Or, il may be
due to the absence of any enterprise among Farm radicals.
