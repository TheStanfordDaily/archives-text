## 
### 
The Daughters of tlic American Hcvolnlion met al their
annual convention yesterday and outdid themselves in a
fanfare of narrow-mindedness and jingo patriotism. The
president, in her opening address, made it plain that the
organization was determined to follow its antiquated pol
icy of nationalism.
She reiterated the refusal of the I).A.R. to hack recog
nition of Soviet Russia and any disarmament program,
t his narrow platform, coming at a time when international
co-operation and security is one of the great needs of the
day, is almost criminal.
The question of the recognition of Russia is certainly
open to argument there are undeniable noints on both
sides. It is just ;is certain, however, thai the D.A.R. argu
ments are beside the question. They admittedly fear an
invasion of the "red menace." Thev would keep tile Ameri
can people from the "contamination" of communism. Anv
freedom ol individual choice in the matter is not consid
ered.
This comes with exceedingly bad taste from an organi
zation which claims to be descended from a generation of
men who fought to free the I nited Stales. A still greater
lack ot taste is shown in their program to increase the
armed forces of the country at the very time when every
effort is bring made in the direction of international dis
armament.
The Editorial Staff will meet at 1 : 15 o'clock.
