# BULL SESSION
## MASKING THE PAIN 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
The man who first discovered thai
children would take quinine pills 01
anything else—provided all wa. l
thickly covered with sugar—espe
-1 dally pink-colored sugar—was .
genius. The annual King Conte.si
applies the discovery of that geniui
in quite the tricky fashion. Now
• everyone knows that charity is a
horrible word—and barring socia
: pressure and personal publicity
j there's nol a philanthropist in ;i
carload.
I
This is especially true of us col
legians who have an unboundinp
faith in our own future and a
thorough disregard for the past 01
present of anyone else. If the Con
valescent. Home Appeal had to de
pend on voluntary contributions
! placed in a big tin box on the En
i gineering Corner, it is safe to say
; the results wouldn't wear and tear
; on the box.
And so along comes the King of
I the Masque Ball Contest. By this
J little (but worthy) subterfuge, wo
shell out coin of the realm with a
broad smirk on our lips—maybe,
even a guffaw. No one thinks about
charity; it's their weights that hold
up interest. I think the weight
should appear after every candidate.
That's giving the tall babes a raw
deal, so maybe it would be better
to list the weight per inch of height.
The Rally Committee promised us
as much. And I for one want to
know what I am voting for; there
may be lots in a name but there's
lots more in these potential queens.

Let the contest be decided as it was I
• planned—by good honest avoirdu- |
pois. Politics is full of blind voting, i
Here, in the Home of Truth and !
Beauty, let the weights speak for j
1 themselves.
; There is something convincing in I
knowing what your queen will j
weigh. It takes matters from behind j
the veil of obscurity and contradic- j
tion and places the contest on a |
good solid foundation. At least my i
guess is that the contest will be
well-grounded when once the I
weights are made public. At present
one's weight is somewhat personal—
since no one quite knows whether
the masculine ideal of the feminine
J figure is athletic or flowing curves, j
And even if they did, some of the!
contestants might not qualify umk'r i
either criterion. Still, the public must |
be served. The would-be queens
I must reveal.
In all (lie shower of votes and the'
bellow of ballyhoo about the "King !
Contest," few stop to consider that j
it really has degenerated into a j
queen contest. True, we vote fori
king and queen; but no one knows j
who the king in the pair is or why J
he is. The poor kings. They're there j
and nothing else. They show the !
I marked decline of the male at Stan- !
!ford.
In fact, there is no better way to j
describe the kings than just a bunch
of Mr. Amelia Earhart Putnams.
Yes, it is rumored that she has a
husband and that his name is Mr.
Putnam. Of course, that makes little
! difference and so do the Kings.

In fact, there is no better way to j
describe the kings than just a bunch
of Mr. Amelia Earhart Putnams.
Yes, it is rumored that she has a
husband and that his name is Mr.
Putnam. Of course, that makes little
! difference and so do the Kings.

J little (but worthy) subterfuge, wo
shell out coin of the realm with a
broad smirk on our lips—maybe,
even a guffaw. No one thinks about
charity; it's their weights that hold
up interest. I think the weight
should appear after every candidate.
That's giving the tall babes a raw
deal, so maybe it would be better
to list the weight per inch of height.
The Rally Committee promised us
as much. And I for one want to
know what I am voting for; there
may be lots in a name but there's
lots more in these potential queens.

knowing what your queen will j
weigh. It takes matters from behind j
the veil of obscurity and contradic- j
tion and places the contest on a |
good solid foundation. At least my i
guess is that the contest will be
well-grounded when once the I
weights are made public. At present
one's weight is somewhat personal—
since no one quite knows whether
the masculine ideal of the feminine
J figure is athletic or flowing curves, j
And even if they did, some of the!
contestants might not qualify umk'r i
either criterion. Still, the public must |
be served. The would-be queens
I must reveal.
In all (lie shower of votes and the'
bellow of ballyhoo about the "King !

it really has degenerated into a j
