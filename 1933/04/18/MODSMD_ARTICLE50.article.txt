THE WHITE SISTER (M-Ci-M)—
j At the Stanford Theatre.
With very little evidence of the
i original F. Marion Crawford story,
"The White Sister," much rejuve
i nated, manages to make an occa
i sionally moving and always pic
i torially effective film.
In its essentials conventional to
| the extreme, the picture is lifted
from the conventional by the per
j formance of Helen Hayes, who again
j suffers (though does not die)
; through the major portion of a nar
; ialive. Her performance-- as indeed
' the entire film is strongly remini
scent of "A Farewell to Arms," and
j Angela Chiramonte is little differ
ent from Catherine Barclay. Miss
j Hayes attains more charm and
] greater emotional quality, while
| sacrificing something of lightness of
I touch.
The battle scenes of the Heming
i way story havq been exchanged for
numerous cloister scenes, and the
taciturn Gary Cooper for the virile
Clark Gable; the photography is
. notably better. In this instance it is
, the well-known story of the girl
| who wt-nt into a convent on learn
ing of the supposed death of her
lover in the war.
Gable turns in a somewhat un
! even performance, as is his habit,
but in the main he is a convincing
hero. Occasionally he lapses into his
"he-man" characterization, in jar
ring contrast to the fragile Miss
Hayes; his diction is noticeably im
' proved since "Strange Interlude."
Louise Closser Hale makes the
most, emotionally and humorously,
i of her role, the best she has had in
some time. But it is Helen Hayes'
: picture, and she makes it worth
while; iji fact, I believe it would be
' worth while even to hear her recite
; the delinquent tax report.
