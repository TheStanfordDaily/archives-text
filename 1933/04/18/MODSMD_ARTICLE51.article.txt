# SEX IN AMERICAN CRITICISM
## 
### 
European critics were agreeably
j surprised by the success of "Maed
: chen in Uniform" in America, but
are still puzzled by America's at
j titude toward it. They cannot un
derstand that for most Americans
1 the word love has only one meaning,
I and that a picture without an over

dose of sex is inconceivable to them.
The censors of course investigated
(he matter, ihus not only increasing
the picture's gate receipts, but also
giving circulation to thus disagree
able rumor. Advertisers have been
far too eager to feed the public's
strange desire to discover something
sexually unusual. Our own Palo
Alto Times is a sinner in this re
gard; I quote from the advertise
ment of April 12: "No picture in
years has caused such whispered
discussion .... What is this strange
appeal? Why does it stir emotions?
What is the true meaning of this
story?"
The trailer also is arranged to
suggest this, showing chiefly scenes
which, taken by themselves, are
Subject to misinterpretation. One
cannot really blame the advertisers
for thus catering to popular fancy.
"Variety," the level-headed and
completely practical publication of
the theatrical world, almost advises
this course. It suggested that the
success of the picture was due only
to this absurd rumor, and that re
ports of the absurdity of the rumor
would kill its popularity. Their er
ror was in underestimating the per
centage of people who will go to
absurd lengths to discover some
thing sexual, as well as failing to
give due credit to the appreciation
by many of the picture's artistry.
In a large measure reviewers must

be condemned for their attitude. The
more intelligent New York review
ers tried to set the public mind light,
but others delicately hinted that the
handling of a strange and delicate
theme is the cause of the picture's
greatness. But the reviewers who
write for pseudo-intellectual audi
ences (1 refer especially to a review
in the Carmel "Villager") even pride
themselves on seeing what the vast
majority are not cultured enough
to see.
Possibly it goes back to the Puri
tan tradition that amopg many so
called intellectuals sex has become
synonymous with sophistication and
culture. No less rabid than the
Puritans against whom they rebel,
they are so confused by this sexular
attitude that they are unable to
evaluate properly those standards
which determine a work of art.
Their criticism of this picture shows
how circumscribed their view of
human nature must be, since they
find themselves unable to under
stand any affection that is not com
( pletely physical.
Underneath, apparently, most,
| Americans are extremely self-con
scious about sex —otherwise they
could not see the strange things they
do in this picture. Nor can one
1 blame them very much, in light of
the taboos that have been placed on
the subject. The blatant outburst
that is following this repression is
no doubt inevitable. Yet one has
some cause to censure the adver
tisers, critics, and pseudo-sophist i
cates who are doing their best to
prolong this period. —Zimansky

cannot really blame the advertisers
for thus catering to popular fancy.
"Variety," the level-headed and
completely practical publication of
the theatrical world, almost advises
this course. It suggested that the
success of the picture was due only
to this absurd rumor, and that re
ports of the absurdity of the rumor
would kill its popularity. Their er
ror was in underestimating the per
centage of people who will go to
absurd lengths to discover some
thing sexual, as well as failing to
give due credit to the appreciation
by many of the picture's artistry.
In a large measure reviewers must

be condemned for their attitude. The
more intelligent New York review
ers tried to set the public mind light,
but others delicately hinted that the
handling of a strange and delicate
theme is the cause of the picture's
greatness. But the reviewers who
write for pseudo-intellectual audi
ences (1 refer especially to a review
in the Carmel "Villager") even pride
themselves on seeing what the vast
majority are not cultured enough
to see.
Possibly it goes back to the Puri
tan tradition that amopg many so
called intellectuals sex has become
synonymous with sophistication and
culture. No less rabid than the
Puritans against whom they rebel,
they are so confused by this sexular
attitude that they are unable to
evaluate properly those standards
which determine a work of art.
Their criticism of this picture shows
how circumscribed their view of
human nature must be, since they
find themselves unable to under
stand any affection that is not com
( pletely physical.
Underneath, apparently, most,

could not see the strange things they
do in this picture. Nor can one

the taboos that have been placed on
the subject. The blatant outburst
that is following this repression is
no doubt inevitable. Yet one has
some cause to censure the adver

cates who are doing their best to
prolong this period. —Zimansky
European critics were agreeably

derstand that for most Americans

the picture's gate receipts, but also
