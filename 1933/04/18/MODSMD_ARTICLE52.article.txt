Congratulations to the Stanford
baseball team for electing right
fielder Dick Miles as the 1934 varsity
captain. Miles was first-string sub
stitute to last year's potent Gold
man-Rintala-Campbell outfield and
played regularly when Goldman did J
not return to school. This year he!
was one of the few steady lights in
Harry Wolter's blinking, on-and-off J
STANFORD BASEBALL TEAM i
|
sign. He w;is cleanup man in the -
baiting order and a brilliant fielder, i
The death of George Saling, Uni- I
versity < f lowa hurdler, Olympic j
champion and intercollegiate rec
ord-holder, earned him headlines in !
all tlie sports pages of the United
Stales. Saling was a great athlete. 1
But had he not been a great athlete,
the death of George Saling, Univer- I
sity of lowa student, would have '
earned him merely a listing in the j
DEATHS column among the Want-j
Ads.
Yesterday there was much verbal
and written comment upon the com- '
petilive spirit that inspired Johnny'
Mottram, Lyle Reynolds, Ed Water- j
bury, Woody Kitchell, and Phil j
Williams in the Big Meet.
Mottram has been working for a j
year and a half to perfect the form j
that made Saturday's javelin throw J
possible. Reynolds had run 1:57.6 '
and 1:58.4 on occasions previous to!
his 1:59-flat race Saturday. Water-j
bury, who threw 204 feet 7 inches, j
was once considered a prospect for j
Ihe American Olympic team but
never lived up to promise since the
American Olympic javelin-throwers
all exceeded 210 feet. Kitchell has I
run 4:T>1.1 in his only race as a
rniler before Saturday's 4:29.7 race,
and was expected by his coach to '
run 4:25 if necessary. Williams has
been jumping over 23 feet in prac- 1
lice, but has been missing the take- i
of] board, which he hit cleanly in |
the Big Meet.
Come-through artists, or hard j
work plus natural ability?

A quotation from November 26, I
1006, "Daily Palo Alto," concerning
a practice track meet, reads, "Prob- j
ably the best work was done in the i
pole-vault by the three freshmen j
vaulters .... All three of these j
men went over 10 feet six inches and j
were vaulting higher when the pole I
broke and the contest had to be 1
called off."
Saturday, Bill Miller and Bud j
Deacon each had several of their !
own pols transported from Stanford |
to Berkeley, and wore vaulting shoes j
imported from Finland. They vault- j
ed 13 feet 9 3-4 inches. Is that evo- |
hit ion?
Captain Gordan, Stanford j
polo coach, typified the games be- j
tween Stanford and the University j
of Arizona as the best polo he has j
ever seen here. The hosts tied Ari- j
zona on Friday 4 to 4 and lost 7 to 2 :
on Saturday, the one-sided score !
resulting from loose Stanford play- J
ing during the first three ehukkers. I
Arizona claims the intercollegiate [
polo championship of the United j
States. â€” Dick Strouse [
