# Trackmen Rest Gray, Laborde Renew Efforts
## MORENTIN TO RUN TWO MILE; LIMIT ENTRIES TO THREE 
### Albert Guerard, Jr 
While his teammates rested from
| their highly successful labors of the
! preceding Saturday, mountainous
' Nellie Gray worked overtime yes
| terday attempting to improve his
j footwork on the all-important hop
I across the ring.
Knocked out of form by a dis-
I tressing back injury, Gray, fifth in
! the Olympic Games last summer,
I failed to place against California.
' Teammates Dunn, Lyman, and La-
I
! horde shut him out of the money.
Injury Bothers
Gray is finding trouble in whip-
I ping his back leg down after the
1 "reverse," and is therefore unable
| to get hLs full weight behind each
I throw. He was peppering the 45-foot
J line consistently yesterday, a far
I cry from hi.s peak days of last
summer when he could flick of! 50 -
! and 51 foot tosses while carrying on i
I a conversation with bystanders.
Phil Morentin, smooth-striding
: distance ace of the Stanford track
sters, is definitely scratched from j
i the mile-run entry list for the Tro- (
jan meet. His U.S.C. opponent in r
the two-mile, Dave Foore, is also |
the best Trojan miler, and Dean ]
! Cromwell may use him in a double ,
| role. \
Three Entries Apiece \
Adhering to conference rules, c
I Saturday's rivals will be limited to t
| three entries apiece in each event.
This decision came as a sad shock 1
|to Here Laborde, usually the team's t
fourth best shot-putter, who pleaded c
I with Templeton to enter a full quar- c
let. "Dink" only scowled in reply, \
! so now Laborde is pelting the 50-
i foot mark in an effort to get on the (
! exclusive shot-putting team. '
The Stanford entry list will not
i be disclosed until after Wednesday's
j practice session, when final time ]
j trials will be held. (
