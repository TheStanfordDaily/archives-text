### 
More women students are needed
in the archery classes if Stanford is
to enter the National Intercollegiate
Telegraphic Archery Tournament
this year, announced Miss Helen
Bunting, archery coach. There is
room for more students in either of
the present classes and another class
will be opened at 4 o'clock on Mon
day, Wednesday, and Thursday if
enough interest is shown.
Stanford entered the tournament
last year and placed in the upper
third in competition with 71 other
colleges. The tournament is carried
on at each college and the results
wired in to a central office.
