# TROJAN TRACK ENIGMA TO BE REVEALED SATURDAY
## 
### 
Too much Indian competition may
reveal the Trojan enigma Saturday
afternoon in fashion totally unex
pected and disconcerting to U.S.C.
supporters.
Here's a*dish of Trojan a la Crom
well to take with your coffee and
snail:
SPRINTS—Charley Parsons, Jr.,
son of tiit' Adam of Trojan sprinters,
has clicked ofT times of 9.7 and 21.2
this year, just a shade under Abe
Hables' 1933 best. Trailing him
faithfully will be Les Ball and Mar
shall Wells or Alf Koenig in the
100: Harry Tompkins and Ball in
the 220. U.S.C. EXPECTS to get
twelve points out of the sprints, con
ceding Hables only two second
places. Stanford's best chance for an
upset is in the longer dash.
QUARTER--Olympian Ed Ablo
wich heads the list of quarter
milers, but has not yet regained last
year's speed. A1 Blackman has an
outside chance to lead him to the
tape. Ablowich has done 49 flat; he
looks down on Reed, 49.6, Warbur
ton, 49.8, Tompkins, 50.1, and Ren
nick, 50.5.
HALF-MlLE—Troy's best chance
for a clean sweep is in the half
mile, where Fei'ris Webster (1:57)
and Jim Cassin (1:57.4) lead the
pack. Webster touched 1:53 last
year, but is one of the most incon
sistent runners in the game. Saffell
and Norene of U.S.C. will contest
the third place with Sam Eastman,
George Naylon, and Dan Murphy of
Stanford. All five are on a par.
MlLE—Dave Foore and Francis
Benavidez have both shattered the
tape in 4:26.2 seconds. Foore may
be kept out of the mile next Satur
day, saving himself for the two-mile.
Ashcraft, Cutler, and Learned are

other Trojan milers.
TWO-MILE -Foore is easily the
best here, barring Stanford's Moron
tin. He has run 9:44.2. Winn has
loped the distance in 10:04; Tsheral't
is an outsider.
HURDLES—Captain Jeddy Welch
has had to play second hurdle all
season to sophomore Bob Lyon, who
1 has shimmered over the barriers in
14.8. Welch's best mark this year is
15 flat. Norman Paul, who has yet to
run slower than 23.9, is easily tho
best Trojan low hurdler,
RELAY—A second-string U.S.C.
outfit has run 3:20.4. Since Ben East
mail's support will only be moral,
Troy's bat on-passers deserve a slight
edge.

14.8. Welch's best mark this year is
15 flat. Norman Paul, who has yet to
run slower than 23.9, is easily tho
best Trojan low hurdler,
RELAY—A second-string U.S.C.
outfit has run 3:20.4. Since Ben East
mail's support will only be moral,
Troy's bat on-passers deserve a slight
edge.
Too much Indian competition may
reveal the Trojan enigma Saturday
afternoon in fashion totally unex
pected and disconcerting to U.S.C.
supporters.
Here's a*dish of Trojan a la Crom
well to take with your coffee and
snail:
SPRINTS—Charley Parsons, Jr.,
son of tiit' Adam of Trojan sprinters,
has clicked ofT times of 9.7 and 21.2
this year, just a shade under Abe
Hables' 1933 best. Trailing him
faithfully will be Les Ball and Mar
shall Wells or Alf Koenig in the
100: Harry Tompkins and Ball in
the 220. U.S.C. EXPECTS to get
twelve points out of the sprints, con
ceding Hables only two second
places. Stanford's best chance for an
upset is in the longer dash.
QUARTER--Olympian Ed Ablo
wich heads the list of quarter
milers, but has not yet regained last
year's speed. A1 Blackman has an
outside chance to lead him to the
tape. Ablowich has done 49 flat; he
looks down on Reed, 49.6, Warbur
ton, 49.8, Tompkins, 50.1, and Ren
nick, 50.5.
HALF-MlLE—Troy's best chance
for a clean sweep is in the half
mile, where Fei'ris Webster (1:57)
and Jim Cassin (1:57.4) lead the
pack. Webster touched 1:53 last
year, but is one of the most incon
sistent runners in the game. Saffell
and Norene of U.S.C. will contest
the third place with Sam Eastman,
George Naylon, and Dan Murphy of
Stanford. All five are on a par.
MlLE—Dave Foore and Francis
Benavidez have both shattered the
tape in 4:26.2 seconds. Foore may
be kept out of the mile next Satur
day, saving himself for the two-mile.
Ashcraft, Cutler, and Learned are

other Trojan milers.
TWO-MILE -Foore is easily the
best here, barring Stanford's Moron
tin. He has run 9:44.2. Winn has
loped the distance in 10:04; Tsheral't
is an outsider.
HURDLES—Captain Jeddy Welch
has had to play second hurdle all
season to sophomore Bob Lyon, who
1 has shimmered over the barriers in
14.8. Welch's best mark this year is
15 flat. Norman Paul, who has yet to
run slower than 23.9, is easily tho
best Trojan low hurdler,
RELAY—A second-string U.S.C.
outfit has run 3:20.4. Since Ben East
