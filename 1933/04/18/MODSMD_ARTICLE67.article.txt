# THORNNILL DRILLS 1933 GRID SQUAD IN FUNDAMENTALS
## 
### Oliver Johnston 
Next year's football team is going
to know its fundamentals, if '"Tiny"
Thornhill has anything to say about
it. Blocking, pivoting, and passing
of the ball between the backs has
dominated on the practice field so
far this spring.
In the past, Stanford supporters
have never been satisfied with the
way in which their team performed
the fundamentals of the game. But
it is a different story nowâ€”with
three fiery coaches who can still get
down on the turf and &ive a prac
tical demonstration to the players.
Apparently the end problem has
solved itself, with the return to
school of Al Norgard and Bob
Grunsky. These two men should de
velop, and they will have to if they
expect to keep ahead of Packard and
Moserip. Moscrip, along with Gray
son, Bronstein, Hamilton, Calloway,
and Trompas all turned out for the
first time yesterday. All were mem
bers of the freshman track team.
The problem which seems to be
worrying "Tiny" the most is the
tackle position. At the present time
W'\s Muller, who has finally decided
to perch at right tackle, and Ed
Lettunich, Ben Palamountain, and
Milt Keller appear to be the best
bets. These boys all lack experience,
with the exception of Palamoun
tain who played some last year.
