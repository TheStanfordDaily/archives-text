# Dirigibles Useful As Scouts, Says Airman
## Walker, Sunnyvale Head, Claims Ships Safe In War Time 
### JOHN KLINE 
After a tragedy such as that in
which the Akron was wrecked, one
| asks "Just, what good are large I
| dirigibles anyway? Of what use are j
j they to the Navy?"
The sole use of such air monsters
is scouting, according to Lieutenant-
Commander M. J. Walker, acting
head of the Sunnyvale Air Station.
"Suppose an enemy fleet were j
rumored to he nearing the Pacific
Coast," he said in an interview.
"The Macpn would be sent out at J
once. She has a 40-mile range of
visibility, and with perfection of |
long-distance photography may
sometime he able to search a 250-
mile area."
"On the instant the fleet was
sighted, orders woidd be given to j
head back for land. As the ship j
turned, every man in the control i
cabin would have a specific task
to perform.
"Now as to the 'safety of the i
i Macon itself, and its crew. Although
. some civilians seem to consider giant
1 dirigibles as sort of 'suicide ships' in I
time of war, such is far from the
facts of the case.
Advantages of Airship
"The airship would be at about
(>OOO feet altitude, speeding at 70
knots an hour. Its pursuers would
start from sea-level, after it was
already leaving, and have a 15- to
i 20-minute climb, and would prob- !
ably make little over 100 knots.
"When the pursuit planes reach
the dirigible, it. is still far from being
at their mercy. Machine-gun iire is
almost completely ineffectual, since 1
1 the ship is built, in so many sections, f
The Macon carries 12 gins of 50
caliber with which it can fight back.
Bombs are not much of a menace.
They would have to strike a girder
by a lucky chance or be sensitive ;
enough to be fired by cloth, bombs,
more delicate than planes are ca
pable of carrying.
"A dive through the ship is really
the only danger. The gunners on
the ship would strive to prevent j
this, and might be successful, since
the steady dirigible is a good posi
tion from which to shoot. Five air- I
planes are also a regular part of the
ship's equipment."

"When the pursuit planes reach
the dirigible, it. is still far from being
at their mercy. Machine-gun iire is
almost completely ineffectual, since 1

The Macon carries 12 gins of 50
caliber with which it can fight back.
Bombs are not much of a menace.
They would have to strike a girder
by a lucky chance or be sensitive ;
enough to be fired by cloth, bombs,
more delicate than planes are ca
pable of carrying.
"A dive through the ship is really
the only danger. The gunners on
the ship would strive to prevent j
this, and might be successful, since
the steady dirigible is a good posi
tion from which to shoot. Five air- I
planes are also a regular part of the
ship's equipment."
