# U.C. Professor And Wife Speak On Italian Castles
## 
### 
Italian castles have two things in
common: Lord Byron has slept in
the dungeon of each, and every one
has its tale of love and murder.
This was the gist of a well-attended
lecture by Professor and Mrs. Ru
dolph Altrocchi of U.C. in the As
sembly Hall last, night.
Alternating during the program
each lecturer told stories associated
with his or her favorite castles and
explained accompanying lantern
slides.
