# Rothert Expresses Hope Of Student-Alumni Contact
## 
### 
At his (k\sk yesterday in the
Alumni office, Harlow Rothert, Field
Secretary of the Association, was
"tickled to he back" on the Farm
again, this time for a more perma
nent stay than the four years he
spent here not so long ago. In the
midst of busily'organizing his new
job, he took a few minutes to com
ment upon conditions at Stanford
from the point of view of an active
alumnus.
"I am sorry to see the Bonfire
and other traditions jjn by the
hoards," said Kothvrt, "allhough
the action taken in abolishing
these activities was undoubtedly
the best thing to do under the
circumstances."
Spirit on the Farm seemed to him
to be as high as ever, especially now
in thi' midst of track season, and

I he expects it to remain as high next
fall when Tiny Thornhill turns loose
the llock of new material he has
gathered around him this spring.
Rothert looks forward eagerly to
his new position, and sees many pos
sibilities in it. It is a newly created
job, and will be carried on largely
experimentally. Here on the campus,
he hopes to make students more
conscious of the alumni organization,
and of the value it holds for all
graduates. â€¢
"Students at present show too
little interest in the Alumni As
sociation." lie says. "It forms the
only contact a student has with
Stanford after graduation. The
nap now existing between the time
a student graduates and the time
he becomes actively connected
with the Alumni body, is too long,
and must be shortened."
