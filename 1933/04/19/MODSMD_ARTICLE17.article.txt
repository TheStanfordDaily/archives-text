This* afternoon at ".I o'clock Stanford Masque Ball fans, clustered around
the bulletin hoard on the Library lawn, will determine their 193:1 Kim

While other campus groups prepared to let loose a final barrage of
pennies this morning to grab the throne for favored couples, word came
that the mysterious team of Mister and Miss Bratchberry, First Class,
now leading, will be revealed at 10 o'clock this morning. They are re
putedly prominent in campus activities.

at the A.S.S.L. offices in the Old iJnioii at the new low price of $1.50
for the Ball, which is scheduled with all its old-time gaiety and color
greater than ever for this Friday evening in the Pavilion.
Although campus costumers were reported doing a large business, many
of the guests are expected to come in "home-made" costumes which were
exceedingly popular last year. Men wore anything from pajamas and bed
sheets to full-dress coats with no trousers and fancy garters.
