# HABLES READY TO RUN RELAY IN U.S.C. MEET
## Miller Injures Heel At U.C., May Not Be Able To Vault Saturday DOPESTERS UNCERTAIN George Naylon, Jim Willson Also On Sick List 
### 
Les liables may return to the
ranks of the 440 men if his presence
in the relay is required Saturday.
The versatile speeder is all prepared
to run his lap against the Trojan
quartet if, by some huge joke oi
fate, victory in the U.S.C.-Stanford
meet should hinge upon (he winning
of the relay. *
Doing a bit of advance work t<»
test the durability of his legs in
the longer race, liables ran a 49.7
lap, despite a dusty wind that
whipped around Angell Field.
Possibility that Hables may run in
the relay developed from the vari
ous speculations on the probabl
score of Saturday's duel. 'Hie fig-

ures ran all the way from an igno
minous total for Stanford that was »
very low indeed, to highly optimistic
sums which indicated the Cardinal •
might win (i 9 points, or 6ti points,
be tied before the relay with 6-1
points. All of which computation i:>
very far fetched, but as the old lady
remarked, "You can't always some
times tell."

Two years ago Les forsook his
specialty of the sprints and rati
against Williams in the 440 in a
vain effort to snatch a victory from
the Trojan horde. That was the
much-discussed race in which
Hables pressed Williams to 48.:.!
after the Trojan had seemingly
fouled Hables coming off the turn
in the final surge for the tape.
Later in Ihc day Hables returned
to run with the quartet that ran i
3:14.3 mile relay and broke the world
record for that event.
Tlie old threat of injuries wa:.
again apparent yesterday, when
George Naylon turned up with a
slight case of bronchitis. Sprinter
Jimmy Willson pulled a muscle
against California jin the 100 Satur
day.
