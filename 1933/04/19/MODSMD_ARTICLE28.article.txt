# Police Protect Student Welfare in Test Case on "Mile and a Half" Law
## 
### 
The well-known "mile and :i linlf' section of the Cali
fornia Penal Code is on trial ;il last. Is il illegal to sell a
perfectly legal and non-Intoxicating beverage in an area
where alcoholic and intoxicating beverages are forbidden ?
That is the anomalous question which will soon be threshed
out in the Palo Alto courts.
The Palo Alto test case was framed, naturally. Two
local policemen arrested a man in the. act of selling a
bottle of 2 per cent beer to another man, and an arrest
and jail confinement followed. The charges against the
alleged law-breaker are three: violation of the slate one
mile and a half law, violation of the city charter, and vio
lation of the city ordinance against the sale of alcoholic
drinks. And an attorney, who is a Stanford man of the
1932 vintage, by the way, is attempting to secure his client's
release on a writ of habeas corpus.
Of course the whole thing is just an experiment with
law and justice, and their administration. The Palo Alto
court is in an unenviable position, .lust last week it de
cided that the sale of near-beer, alcoholic but noil-intoxi
cating, was not illegal under the city charier or city ordi
nance. Beyond that, the judge even decided that such
beverages were not even alcoholic in the meaning of the
law.
Last week's decision should, logically, provide some
sort of precedent for the case which now faces the court,
liolh the near-beer and it 2 per cent variety have the same
status under the existing national and stale laws. But there'
is a difference, so many people say. What will the Palo
Alto court decide? Will it follow the legal precedent it has
itself established, or will il listen to the personally preju
diced arguments of an indeterminate number of local citi
zens?
The test of the mile and a half ruling was certain to
come, as long as college men are college men, and as long
as some people remember the fact. Most embarrassing,
however, that the lest had to be made at Stanford, where
campus bootlegging and consumption of both legal and
illegal beverages has been so quiet and orderly.
