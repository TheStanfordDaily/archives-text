						Radical Past That Is Rightly Dead Spiked by One Who Has Been Called a Radical

W hen people are panicked, they are likely to grasp at
straws. Sometimes the straws are real, straws that the
world lias long been grasping after. Hut usually Ihev are
not straws. They are bugaboo.
This week's controversy in Ihe tinted Stales Senate
was no exeeflion. It was not Ihe people, Ibis lime, who
were grasping at straws, but Ihe representatives of Ihe
people. The men who are elected because Ihev know how
lo wave their arms when talking to the people. The men
in whom the people have been taught to place trust. The
men in whom Ihe people have been hoodwinked into plac
ing confidence.
Not since Ihe witchcraft of the late 18th century have
the citizens of this fair land been so misrepresented. One
of Ihe senators, talked by his own eloquence into believing
thai he was a savior of the people, fell himself obligated
to propose some plan that was sure-lire to raise the mob,
the mob that had elected him, out of the slough of despond,
commonly called the "depression."
lie had read history, this representative, and he remem
bered thai Hrvan once panicked the people with a propo
sition thai emphasized silver. And he wanted to be re
elected. So this senator prescribed as the cure for all de
pression evils, remonotization of the white metal. He pic
tured himself as a national hero. Me failed.
The "why" of why he failed was the "why" of why a
number of other measures presented lo the representatives
of tin 1 people have failed in those days of rabid searching,
of radical advocating. Hooscvelt, the one man who has
proved that the faith the people placed in him was not mis
placed, spiked it.
A hand, gentlemen, for the man who has Ihe courage If)
uphold economics, however elementary, in the White
House.
