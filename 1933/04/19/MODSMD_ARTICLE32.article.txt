# BULL SESSION
## NURSES FOR THE BAND 
### 
Live and learn. I was always un
der th< general impression that the
Stanford Band was composed of
Stanford students. That seemed to
be a fairly reasonable supposition
in that we usually found Stanford
students on the football team, the
debate team, and the Daily—not to
mention the Glee Club, the Y.W.C.A.
cabinet, and Pan Hellenic. Last Sat
utday, however, it was disclosed
that some of those fellows in the
white uniforms have never stuck
their heads into a classroom.
The horrible truth was uncovered
when a local student heard and saw
u horrible exhibition of "collegian
ism" on one of the Berkeley ferries.
The boys—conspicuously bedecked
in their outstanding uniforms—and
with their instrument cases well
plastered with Stanford stickers—
were giving the passengers an added
attraction for their fare. The boys
were out-doing Carl Laemlle (Col
lege Comedies) at his worst.

On closer investigation, he found
them not to be local students; they
were high-school hotchas who hap
pened to play in our band. There
were probably over half a dozen;
and what they lacked in numbers,
they made up in volume--of noise.
He finally, with blushing cheeks,
managed to quiet thern a bit.

Several hours later his mortifica
tion was rekindled when he met a
part of the same contingent on Mar
ket Street. They were still in Stan
ford Band uniforms and were still
putting on quite a show for the pub
lic. All the passing morons thought

it was great sport. "These Stanford
fellers sure are the collegiate hunch
—just like the movies and College
Humor."

First of all, there is absolutely no
excuse for non-Stanford people
playing in the Stanford Band. The
project is and most of us have al
ways thought it to be a University
organization. Though the temptation
must have been keen at times, no
and hits yet suggested, to my knowl
edge at least, that the University
canvass the waterfront for gridiron
material. Some of these stevedores
would make "plenty sweet" foot
ballers--to use a sports-page term,
if I may.
If we can't have a stupendous
band without drafting high-school
musical prodigies, then our band
will have to forfeit its stupendosity.
If our band can't be as large as
U.S.C.'s without using outsiders,
then it can't lie. I do not seriously
think that the University will be
hopelessly disgraced if a small band
prances on the field. Wo can more
easily bear the disgrace of a small
band than exhibitions like those de
scribed.
Lastly, if those that run the Stan
ford Band persist in boosting the
size, and perhaps quality, of our
tooting by running in anything thai
can hold a piece of brass and blow—
regardless of where he hails from
or why, then they at least can send
nurses along with the boys. The
nurses would insure that the Stan
ford uniforms be stripped off them
before they are allowed to roam at
large.
butcher bird and a pussy cat are two
other fellas.
Otto Schroeder has a cat which
chewed up a young butcher bird.
That was last Monday and the cat
has since had the toughest week of
his ornithological career.
The old butcher birds have been
camping in a nearby tree, and every
time Schroeder's cat starts into the
back yard they zoom at him like a
scene out of "Hell's Angels."

Now what in the mien
Of that solemn old fowl
Inspired the creator
Of "Tight as an Owl?"
