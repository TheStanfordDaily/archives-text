THE BAD MAN (Browne)—At the!
Community Theatre.
"The Bad Man" is not a good play.
It is not even a well-knit melo
drama. But it does furnish exciting
moments for an appreciative audi
ence and good opportunities for
characterization. Jim Quinby made
a smooth and consistently amusing,
i Pancho Lopez, but Bill Pabst as the
chair-ridden Uncle Henry furnished
; (he most laughs. Malcolm McGilvray,
i as Pancho's silent henchman, raised
11: bit part to a lead; he made Pedro .
the most colorful character in the
play. Whitmore Waldegrave was a
; good snake-fti-the-grass and Jack
j Parsons looked natural as a cowboy.
' Rosemary Smith did the hardest and
most realistic comedy fall I have
ever seen on the amateur stage. The
rest of the cast was a negative
quantity, or seemed so in contrast.
Due perhaps to change of direc-
{ tors midway through rehearsals or
i to the difficulty of the star's as*um
; ing direction of the play, the direc
j tion was bad—alike in tempo, cli—
j maxes, and stage positions. Actors
j covered each other unnecessarily,
i cues were missed, and several scenes
were badly let down. On the other
hand, Waldmar Johansen's set, the
lighting, and the technical effects
were excellent—remarkable exam
-1 pies of how the ingenious small
I theatre can prove better than many
J professional theatres. —Brauns
| FAMILY HISTORY—By V. Sack
ville-West. Doubleday, Doran. (At
the Gordon Strawbridge Library
in the Cellar.
As in her other novels, Miss Sack
! ville-West draws all her characters
with remarkable clarity. Her char
! aeters are living people, typical of
the English gentry. The heroine,
| Evelyn Jarrold, is an unforgettable
j figure.
The story deals with the conflict
' brought on by the different stand
ards of two generations, which re

! suits in tragedy. Evelyn Jarrold,
representative of Victorian ideals,
fall* in love with Miles Vane-Mer
riek, who scoffs at the old standards.
Their differences in temperament
and training do not bode a happy
future. The termination of their
entente leaves them both dismally
, unhappy.
The story is told with great pre
cision. The interest of the reader is
sustained from the start, the tempo
of the story never slackening. Per
haps some of the emotional scenes
have been a bit overdone, but the
general merits of the book more
than compensate for that possible
deficiency. —Frank
