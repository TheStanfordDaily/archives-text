Yes sir, the good old Daily Sports I
staff, that hard-hided crew of raga- j
muffins, is in a bad way today. Its |
i-.corle.ss head man, the prolific and
verbose Mr. Richard B. Strou.se has
folded up and repaired to the Rest '
Home until further orders.
Ye.s, that above-mentioned staff is 1
much in the same predicament as |
the track .squad when the track
squad's Mr. Ben Eastman folded up
not so long ago. A.s Mr. Eastman is
to the track .squad, so Mr. Strouse
i.s to the sports staff. And we never
though) that hi.s great heart would
give in. But. evidently too much as
sociation with reticent coaches,
punch-drunk linemen, and rusty
jointc 'I sprinters was too great a
burden for his once unquenchable
spirits, and the mighty Strouse
pulled a tendon in his typewriter
finger. In his absence, we will at
tempt to carry on his .swift pace.
PAPKIt HOYS ARE
SQUAWKING A(«AI\
The boys around the office are
cursing their luck because Lefty
Campbell didn't make his letter. For
therein lay a great feature story.
Lefty was a substitute pitcher on
'34's freshman baseball team 'way
had; a couple of years ago. Compet
ing with Stan Anderson and Bob
Savinske, Lefty had not a chance,
lie showed up for practice regularly
(■very afternoon, and toiled until hi.s
freckled, pug-nosed map was grimy
with sweat and dust, but the harder
he worked, the less notice he got.
lle never pitched a fraction of an
inning in a single game, though
sometimes, if he was lucky, they let
him pitch batting practice.
LEFTY FIGHTS A
TOUGH SCHEDULE
In his sophomore year a discour
aged Lefty Campbell gave up pitch
ing and went out for manager, but
he made no headway there. So this
spring he was back on the mound,
twirling them over, and wild as all
left-handers always are.
But a.s the season went on, Camp
hell improved, and what with Stan
Anderson on the ineligible list last
quarter, Lefty got to work a few
games. His big moment came last
Friday against U.S.C., when he went
in a.s relief pitcher after the game
was deep in the red. Lefty pitched
great ball for four and a fraction
innings, hut ho needed nine full in
nings against U.S.C. to earn hi.s
letter.
So Lefty lost out again, and the j
boys in the office are cursing their J
luck. —Spud Hamilton
