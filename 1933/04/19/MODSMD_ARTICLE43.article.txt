# Gomez Pitches Yankees To Fifth Straight Victory
## 
### 
NEW YORK. April 18 (/{>)â€”Ver
non Gomez, thin left-handed ace of
the New York Yankees, picked up
his feud with the Athletics today
just where he left off last season,
besting Big George Earnshaw, 2 to 1,
in a brilliant tussle that gave the
Yanks a record oC five straight, vic
tories so far in the youthful cam
paign.
But for a ringing double down the
left field foul line by Jimmie Foxx,
after a ipass to Max Bishop and an
error by Joie Sewell had put men
on first and second in the sixth with
two out, Gomez would have opened
his personal 1933 campaign against
the A's with a shutout.
