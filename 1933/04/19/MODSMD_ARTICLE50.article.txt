## 
### Oliver Johnston 
With the majority of points and
possibly clean sweeps going to the
Indians in both weights, the Tro
jans are likely to find themselves
about 18 points behind in the field
events.
Here are a few of the best per
formances of the Trojans to date,
which you can expect to be ex
ceeded next Saturday:
Stanford Sweep
SHOT—Harper's best put of 50
feet 5-16 inch has been bettered by
all three Stanford entries. Brown
has thrown only 45 feet 8 inches; he
should not even qualify.
DISCUS—The situation is the
same in this event, with Bateman
having heaved the platter only 143
feet. He is followed by Chrisman,
135 feet, and Applegate, 131 feet.
JAVELIN — If Johnny Mottram
performs as he did last Saturday
lie should beat Troy's best, McKen
zie, who has thrown 201 feet 8 :! 4
inches. Williams is next in line with
188 feet 3 inches.
Trojan's Chance
lIK ill JUMP—The Trojan's best
chance for a clean sweep in the
field is in the high jump. Von Osdel,
with 0 feet 3 inches,
ton with (i feet 2 inches, have not
performed up to their last year's
standard. McNefl and Schwccn of
Stanford should fight it out for third.
BROAD JUMP—Olsan's mark of
23 feet 7 inches is only V 4 inch bet
ter than Williams' winning jump
against the Bears. McFadden, leap
ing 22 feet 9'/a inches, and Gilbert
with 22 feet 8 inches, will probably
be the other two entrants for the
Trojans.
, POLE VAULT—This should be
the highlight of the field events.
Miller, Deacon, and Graber have
all cleared 14 feet even this season.
