# FROSH TRACK MEN WIN SEVEN MEETS IN RECORD SEASON
## 
### 
In retrospect the freshman track
team of 1933 appears as one of the
best in Stanford history. Led by
Captain Chuck Nimmo, the most
promising Stanford track prodigy
since Ben Eastman was a frosh, the
combative yearlings chalked up a
record of seven victories against
strong competition, and no defeats.
Numerically the Papooses scored
35!)' 1 points to their opponents'
297. This margin would have been
wider were it not for the one
triangular meet in which the two
opponents of the frosh together
equalled the total of Hill Elling
ton's squad.
Sam Klopstock was the high-scor
ing spikester for the season with a
total of 59 points tallied in the cen
tury and hurdles. The consistently
speedy Nimmo was next with 53,
an amazing total for a distance man.
Hurdler Kingsbury, who started the
season with sensational wins, came
in third with 47 digits to his credit.
There were many others who con
tributed heavily to the '36 men's
string of victories. Reynolds in the
shot, Leedy in the discus, supported
by Holloway and Calloway; Jonas,
followed by Ginn, in the vault; Nobs
and Cottrell in the high jump; these
names recurred in the results week
after week.
Grayson Is Double-threat
On the track Davis and De(linger
in the quarter; Bronstein and Hart
mann in the sprints; McKenzie in
the relay came through several
times. Nor can we forget the well
publicized grid-cinderpath flash —
Mr. Bobby Grayson—who runs the
legs off enterprising footballers in
the fall and trackmen in the spring.
Harper, Edwards, and Moran
would occasionally help out in a
relay or 440.
