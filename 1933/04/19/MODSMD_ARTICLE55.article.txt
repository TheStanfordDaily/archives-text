NEW YORK, April 18 (/P)â€”Naval
headquarters here announced late
today that naval vessels grappling,
near the spot where the Akron
plunged into the ocean two weeks
ago had located what appealed to
be the main wreckage of the diri
gible.
Among the pieces of wreckage
brought to the surface was a section
of the control car, said wireless
messages intercepted by the New
York naval communications office.
Divers sent overboard from the
naval tug Falcon reported finding
the bottom covered with many small
pieces of debris. One large piece of
the bottom and starboard side of the
control car was hoisted aboard the
Falcon.
