# INTRAMURAL BALL TEAMS READY TO OPEN 7 LEAGUES
## 
### 
With the completion of entries in
the intramural baseball, two divi
sions of men are ready to begin play
early next week. Those playing with
a hard ball are divided into three
leagues; soft ball players have four.
Intramural officials have ruled
that organizations may enter teams
in each division if they are com
posed of different players.
Equipment for the indoor ball
league will be supplied by the gym
nasium, but the hard ball players
must furnish their own balls and
bats.
