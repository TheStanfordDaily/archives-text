## 
### 
To honor (he late Professor Sam-

uel Seward, plans are being made
by the English Club for a Samuel
i Seward Memorial Award, with a
fund from which prizes will be
awarded for the best material sub-
I mitted to the annual Yearbook of
Stanford Writing.
Previously there lias been a $50
prize for the best work, but with
the formulation of the Seward
Memorial Award the English Club
has decided to divide the money
into two $25 awards, one for
poetry and one for prose.
This year's book of student writ
ing will be the fourth in the pub
lication's present form. Last year the
book was considered by Poetry
Magazine as being one of the best
college anthologies.
There >is still a little time for
students in all departments to sub
mit manuscripts for the new Year
book. Contributions should be left
in the cabinet in Room 200 or in
I the office of Dr. Margery Bailey.
