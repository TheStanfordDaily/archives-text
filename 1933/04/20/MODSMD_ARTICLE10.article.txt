# 'Hawk Island' Presentation First In U.S.
## Special Permission Given For Production 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
When "Hawk Island" is offered in
the Assembly Hall on April 28, Stan
ford audiences will view the first
American production of Howard
Irving Young's "drama of the night."
The play is being produced with the
special permission of Samuel
French, holder of the American
rights.
On the morning of January 24,
1931, the London press contained
reviews for thus new mystery drama,
and their superlatives proved mer
ited, for the play was accorded an
enthusiastic popular reception, and
enjoyed a run of several months.
Cast Brilliant
The performance was presented
at the Comedy Theatre under the
direction of Sewell Collins. The cast
contained such well-known British
theatrical names as Hugh Williams,
who enacted the leading role of
Gregory Sloane, played in the Stan
ford production by Pete Peck, Min
nie Blagden in Barbara Collins'
role of Madeline Austen, and Henry
Hewitt and Edgar Norfolk.
"Hawk Island" was received as
a new type of mystery play—one
in which the conventional ele
ments of mystery are completely
reversed from the rise to the linal
fall of the curtain—and one which
varies from the usual in the deft
combination of comedy, sophisti
cation, and character-drawing
with a unique murder situation.
The play has been filmed in
America under a different title, and
achieved marked success in its field.
The U.S. manufactures today ten
million tons of paper.
