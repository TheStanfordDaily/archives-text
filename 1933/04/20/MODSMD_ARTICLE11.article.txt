# Hitler Order Hits Colleges
## Edict Excludes Jews From Free Masonic Lodges 
### 
BERLIN, April 19 (A I)—Dissolu
tian of all Free Masonic lodges in
Germany and their reformation on
a "purely Christian basis" was an
nounced tonight by the National
Grand Lodges.
The lodges will be reorganized
under the name "National Christian
Order of Friedrich the Great."' Jews
will not be permitted to join the
new order.
The Aryan law, which bars
nearly all Jews from civil service
and degrades them to second class
citizenship, is being invoked in all
German universities by Chancel
lor Hitler's Cabinet.
Final action was postponed today
until Saturday because Hitler is re
maining in Berchtesgaden, Bavaria,
awaiting the personal report o£ Cap
tain Hermann Goering, leading Nazi
member of the Cabinet, on his visits
with Premier Mussolini and the Pope
in Rome.
Dr. Wilhelm Friek, Nazi Minister
of the Interior, has drafted a law
legulating admittance of Jewish
students to universities and other
institutions of the Reich according
to their ratio of the entire popula
tion. Another law will assure Nazi
leadership of student organizations.
