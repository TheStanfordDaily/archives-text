# Water Carnival Recalls Junior Week Traditions
## 
### RUTH ROSS 
Festivities on Lake Lagunita
(granted a heavy rainfall) have
included contests and conflagrations
presented by more than twenty jun
ior classes. Some events became
synonymous with Junior Week on
the Farm, and some will probably
never be repeated.
For instance, the 300-pound stu
dent (says tradition) who for four
years won the contest in remaining
under water, and the champion
diver whose gasoline-soaked clothes
were ignited as he dived, are no
longer in our midst.
According to Professor E. W. Mar
tin, former director of the Stanford
Band, Junior Week of the days be
fore the War was a "week of gaiety,"
when everyone emerged on the cam
pus in new clothes, and enormous
crowds gathered at the lake.
From 1910 to 1915 Junior Week
was ushered in each year with an
evening celebration at Lagunita, in-

cluding in 1!)12 a giant figure '13 of
red fire in the center of the lake.
The third-year students presented
their play, prom, and Chappie, the
next few days; also a day-time wa
ter carnival, beginning in the morn
ing and featuring boating, swim
ming, and on one occasion a pair
of men's crews dressed to represent
two feminine institutions.
Another tradition, told by a later
graduate, is that the campus man
who dated one of the "500" for a
Junior Week event was thereby ob
ligated to include the whole pro
gram, from carnival to prom, and
not forget the opera. He also un
derstood that appearance at two
Junior Weeks with the same young
lady would amount to announcing
their engagement. The exposer of
this tradition took in three Junior
Weeks with the same young lady,
but defied convention and didn't
marry her.
