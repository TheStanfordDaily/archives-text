# DON BLACKMAN PULLS MUSCLE; OUT OF RELAY
## Lead-off Man Injures Leg In Practice Race; Abe Hables May Run 
### Albert Guerard, Jr 
Step softly or you're done for!
The haunting Nemesis that
pulls muscles and Mows away
first places like weightless feath
ers still hangs over the Stanford
Stadium as Dink Templeton's
do-or-dic track team goes
through its final workouts for
the most important track meet
of the year.
Don Blackmail, lead-off man on
the relay team, was added to the
daily-growing casualty list yester
day when he pulled u muscle while
striding through a warm-up dash.
ISlackman hud been counted on to
sprint out a lead over Troy's first
baton-passer, Cotton Warburton, but
the elder Blackmail is doomed to
watch the race from the sidelines.
His place will probably be taken
by Frank Fullcnwider, who in
turn may be replaced by sprinter
Abe Hables in case the meet
hinges on the relay. Sam Eastman,
Art Rice, and A1 Blackmail fill out
the Indian quartet.
But that's not the worst of it!
Miller on Crutches
Bill Miller still hobbles on crutch
cs and the cramped muscles of Bud
Deacon arc responding to treatment
with agonizing slowness. Only
George Edmonds of the Indian
space-climbing trio is left hale and
hearty, but it's dollars to doughnuts
he'll get run over today, or at least
break an arm.
This is the dismal pole-vaulting
situation on the Farm, as uninjured
Bill Graber, U.S.C.'s national cham
pion, rubs his hands and polishes
his pole in anticipation of THE track
meet, which (need we tell you?) is
but 48 hours away. Neither Miller
or Deacon did any vaulting yes
terday and they will go into the
meet Saturday with a week of in
activity behind them.
But crutches or no, both Miller
and Deacon WILL VAULT against
the Trojans. Deacon, the least-in
jured of the two, is Stanford's best
bet to win.
Quintet Looks Good
While a chilling, muscle-endan
gering wind swept through the Sta
dium, five athletes tried to cheer up
the morose 'Dink" Templeton by
turning in marks which stamp them
as strong contenders against Troy.
Although finding trouble with his
crouch and wind-up, discus cham
pion Here Laborde made three tosses
encouragingly close to the 160-foot
line, Johnny Mottram strengthened
his position of favorite over U.S.C.'s
spear men by flinging the javelin
196 feet, Nellie Gray showed con
siderable shot-putting improvement
in reaching 49 feet, and Jim Ferric
and Phil Morentin, the long-winded
of the squad, stepped ofT a
3:10.t> time for 1320 yards. That
means about 4:28 for the full mile.
Morentin will enter only the two
mile against U.S.C., however.
Fighting for the honor of com
peting against Olympic Champion
Duncan McNaughton, Jay Whar
ton leaped 5 feet, (» inches to nose
»»nt skeleton-like Lewis for the
third position on the high-jump
squad. Stanford's other jumpers
will be Lloyd Schween and Bob
Keeble, who are not frightened
by world-wide reputations.

The haunting Nemesis that
pulls muscles and Mows away
first places like weightless feath
ers still hangs over the Stanford
Stadium as Dink Templeton's
do-or-dic track team goes
through its final workouts for
the most important track meet
of the year.
Don Blackmail, lead-off man on
the relay team, was added to the
daily-growing casualty list yester
day when he pulled u muscle while
striding through a warm-up dash.
ISlackman hud been counted on to
sprint out a lead over Troy's first
baton-passer, Cotton Warburton, but
the elder Blackmail is doomed to
watch the race from the sidelines.
His place will probably be taken
by Frank Fullcnwider, who in
turn may be replaced by sprinter
Abe Hables in case the meet
hinges on the relay. Sam Eastman,
Art Rice, and A1 Blackmail fill out
the Indian quartet.
But that's not the worst of it!
Miller on Crutches
Bill Miller still hobbles on crutch
cs and the cramped muscles of Bud
Deacon arc responding to treatment
with agonizing slowness. Only
George Edmonds of the Indian
space-climbing trio is left hale and
hearty, but it's dollars to doughnuts
he'll get run over today, or at least
break an arm.
This is the dismal pole-vaulting
situation on the Farm, as uninjured
Bill Graber, U.S.C.'s national cham
pion, rubs his hands and polishes
his pole in anticipation of THE track
meet, which (need we tell you?) is
but 48 hours away. Neither Miller
or Deacon did any vaulting yes
terday and they will go into the
meet Saturday with a week of in
activity behind them.
But crutches or no, both Miller
and Deacon WILL VAULT against
the Trojans. Deacon, the least-in
jured of the two, is Stanford's best
bet to win.
Quintet Looks Good
While a chilling, muscle-endan
gering wind swept through the Sta
dium, five athletes tried to cheer up
the morose 'Dink" Templeton by
turning in marks which stamp them
as strong contenders against Troy.
