# Roosevelt Moves To Inflate Prices On World Scale
## President Swings U.S. Off Gold Standard; Capitol Hill Rushes Bill Granting F.R. Dictatorial Powers To Expand and Regulate Currency 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 19 (/Pi—ln a day of historic financial action, Presi
dent Roosevelt moved boldly forward tonight for controlled inflation
on an international scale. He swung the United States off the gold
standard in world tradd as an opening shot and tonight sanctioned legisla
tion giving him broad authority to carry through his program to lift
American prices, stabilize the world exchanges on a revised gold basis
• and expand the use of currency.

The swiftly executed manoeuver
by the confident President brought
a turbulent reaction throughout the
world. American stocks and com
modity prices shot upward. The dol
lar fell off. Wall Street quotations on
foreign currency rose spectacularly.
Pointing for his next plays in the
complicated field of international
finance, Mr. Roosevelt called in ad
visers tonight to outline procedure.
From Capitol Hill came a hill
extending to the President au
thority to issue new currency, to
modify the gold ratio and content
of the dollar, and to establish a
dollar, and to establish a dollar
stabilization board.
To speed action, the proposal
probably will be speeded as an
amendment on the pending foreign
commodity bill.
