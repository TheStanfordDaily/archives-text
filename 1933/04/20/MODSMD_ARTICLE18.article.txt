# Inflation Move Value Debated By Economists
## Stuart Chase Favors New Roosevelt Action 
### Sheridan Hegland 
Prosperity or Catastrophe?
I Economists throughout the na
i tion arc debating this question to- |
i day as President Roosevelt sets
out boldly on what appears to be
a clear-cut path to currency in
flation.
In general, the younger econo
| mists, notably the Chicago group,
j lauded the bill that would extend to :
] the Chief Executive power to issue '
| new currency and to modify the gold i
I j ratio and content of the dollar,'
I which is now pending.
Barked by Stuart Chase
i | Led by Stuart Chase, these men ;
[ 1 have long called for inflation as a ,
, | means of breaking the back of the I
| depression and stilling the economic J
I cyclone that has ripped across the 1
.social fabric, bringing disaster and !
[ j ruin.
. j The more conservative faction,
; I their ranks .sadly depleted within the j
j last twelvemonth, have seen in in- I
, j flation the initiation of an era of
• skyrocketing prices and wildly fluc
tuating foreign exchanges. Post-war j
. Germany was cited as portraying the
. evils of inflation excesses.
That America has been at least
• temporarily launched oil an era of j
. rising prices was clearly indicated ;
yesterdajt by—
1. The sensational advance of for
eign exchanges when the Chief i
Executive withdrew support from
the American dollar,
2. The announcement that an
absolute embargo on gold exports
will be preserved,
3. Sweeping gains on the stock
market as the ticker registered the
. record-breaking turnover of five
I million shares,
4. The coincident decline of high
grade bonds as investors rushed to
I convert their holdings into specula- ;
. tive issues,
5. Woodin's declaration that
I means will be found of pumping
idle currency into the channels of
, j commerce,
I ! (>. Efforts by Federal Reserve gov- i
i ernors to free the four or five bil— '
' lions of deposits locked up in closed
i banks.
! Should tlii' hill granting Presi-
I dent Roosevelt extraordinary pow
ers over the currency be passed
by Congress, the Chief Executive
would theoretically he enabled to
j dictate the price level, changing it
1 at will, by altering the gold con
j tent of the dollar.
If Roosevelt is successful in send
ing the prices skyward and freezing
j them before they reach absurd
! heights, economists in general would
sanction the move.
Theoretically justifiable but dan
igerous to handle, inflation has been |
j likened to a huge poker game with
I prosperity for America if she wins,
- I ruin if she loses.
