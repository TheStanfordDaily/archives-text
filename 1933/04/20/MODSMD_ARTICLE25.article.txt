# U.C.L.A. Elects to Play a Long Shot in a Bid for Publicity
## 
### 
It's not as far-fetched as il sounds to say that there has I
never been a civic boosting enterprise of any proportion
which the metropolitan area of Los Angeles has not under
taken, with the purpose of outdoing every other city in the'
country. And nobody hut an Eastern visitor on a rainy I
day could say that the southern boosters had failed to
make their city the most publicized and apparently pros- 1 ,
porous to be found on Pacific shores.
Hut in a never-ending boosting program there are cor-:
tain to be a few bloomers. The publicity bovs will inevi-,
lably play some losing long shots. The latest long shot in
the Los Angeles future book is an intercollegiate crew re
gatta. It seems that the I'oughkeepsie regatta, for many
years the row ing classic of the I nited Slides, is not going j
to he held any more, for financial reasons, nafurallv.
Hul Los Angeles steps into the breach. What ? No in-I
tereollegiale regatta? Gui'l anybody afford to give one?'
Los Angeles can, of course, and so I'.C.L.A., in its first year
of crow competition, is attempting to shoulder the burden.
It matters little just which civic boosters are promising to
foot the bill the Bruins are the sponsors.
It seems barely possible that I .0.L.A., which found it,
necessary to cut its athletic program since flic first of the
year, can he taking this great financial risk. An intercol
legiate regatta at Long Hoach would be a lino tiling, but
it has all the aspects of a bad hot for the Hruins.
