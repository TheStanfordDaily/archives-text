# Clearing Up One Situation But Leaving a Question Still Unsolved
## 
### 
Last Tuesday, tho Daily commented upon a student
demonstration on the campus of the University of Califor
nia, apparently directed in a spirit of extreme nationalism
against a group of visiting Japanese midshipmen.
Now it is revealed thai tho object of the demonstration
was supposed to illustrate just tho opposite altitude. Tho
Social Problems Club of the Herkelev campus declares that
the demonstration \\<ks intended against imperialism in
all forms. Japanese policy in Manchuria, they say, is typi
cal of impcrlialisl aggression throughout the world.
Opposition from the members of tho club is just as
great, they say, to American imperialism. The demonstra
tion, therefore, was not essentially anti-Japanese.
This clears up the situation somewhat, but does not vet
reveal whether the absence of anv demonstration when the
Japanese cadets visited Stanford was due to native polite
ness or lack of anterprise.
