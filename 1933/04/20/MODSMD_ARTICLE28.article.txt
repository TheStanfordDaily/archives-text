# BULL SESSION
## YANKEE DOODLE AND CUBAN RUMBA 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
The dogs of war are beginning to
' yap. Those who feel that somehow
America has the God-given right i
to land troops in every Caribbean
• country that is not managing its
affairs in a manner that suits Con
gress are beginning to bellow. Chief
bellower Representative "Red Her
ring' Fish is already advocating that
we land troops in Cuba.
if Germany were to invade Po
• land, we would be sure that it was
Prussian militarism. if England
lands troops in Ireland, it is gross
imperialism. If Japan launches an
army against China, it is aggres
sion. But somehow, when American
Ma lines smear some litllt* neighbor
ing country out of it:; political ox
-1 istence, it is for the better interests
i of liberty, justice, truth, and the
Constitution. No wonder Japan
j laughs at our State Department with
! its pious demands for "fair play" in
the Orient.
{
There are a lot of things people
in muddy houses can't do. One of
them is to complain of the dust, on
other people's floors. America is re
ported by Americans to have freed
the Cubans from Spanish domina
! tion. We pushed feeble Spain out ;
<>T the Island to the strains of
"America the Beautiful"—and made

I Havana safe for the Sugar Trust.
The nobilily of our motives has
, j never been questioned by the Sugar
Trust although every one else has
been smelling a rat for years. In
fact, even high-school history
teachers are beginning to under
stand. It must be clear.
Subsequent to the (ime when
"Teddy" Roosevelt stormed up San
Juan 11i 11 and into the Governor's
Mansion at. Albany, our Marines
have landed and "established" order
in Havana. The practice is to land,
shoot up most things in sigh!, and j
set up some president, who has a
terrific time holding on to power
as soon as the Marines leave.
It seems that. Maehado is a dic
tator and not a president and is
using the means that all dictators'
must use to maintain themselves
| force, guns, and bullets. That is
their system of government, and it's
none of our business. It. is nothing :
but unadulterated egotism that
maintains that our system of gov
ernment is the best. And it is just,
plain simplicity that would rtiaintain !
that, if it. were best., it would work
; every place. It might be great with
stolid Nordic stock —steeped more or
less in several centuries of Anglo-
Saxon tradition. That doesn't mean
it will work with Latins living in a
semi-wilderness with little or no
; democratic tradition.
I
1 Many people claim that democracy '
lis a failure. It is rumored that
i Roosevelt will be made a dictator,
i If that is ever done, what will be
I our pretense for invading foreign
, countries? Of course, the sanctity
i of our women is always at hand as
a battlecry. Meanwhjle, we have
liberty-for-the T oppressed to rely on.
The National/Eagles are scream
ing on Capitol Mill. The Marines will
soon land to the roll -of drums. Long
j live the Sugar Trust.

There are a lot of things people

been smelling a rat for years. In

teachers are beginning to under

Subsequent to the (ime when
"Teddy" Roosevelt stormed up San
Juan 11i 11 and into the Governor's

terrific time holding on to power
as soon as the Marines leave.
It seems that. Maehado is a dic
tator and not a president and is
using the means that all dictators'
must use to maintain themselves

their system of government, and it's
none of our business. It. is nothing :
but unadulterated egotism that
maintains that our system of gov

plain simplicity that would rtiaintain !
that, if it. were best., it would work

stolid Nordic stock —steeped more or

Saxon tradition. That doesn't mean
it will work with Latins living in a
semi-wilderness with little or no
