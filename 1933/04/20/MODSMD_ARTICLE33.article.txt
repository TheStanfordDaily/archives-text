The Uclans want to be the host
To crews from far and near,
And stage their own regatta,
AI cost that will be dear.
Some folks might say they're altruists*
i Because of what they do;
They're sure to get a trouncing,
Before the darn thing's through.
|
Their budget's cut, their funds art
low,
They spend their dough with glee.
Their motto, now the world will
know,
"What price, publicity?"
