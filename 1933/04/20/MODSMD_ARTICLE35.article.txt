(Elimination of the descriptive
nicknames for queen candidates for
lowed an edict to Masque Ball of
ficials from Miss Mary Yost. Dear

For seven long seasons
He battled her reasons
And finally gave up the ghost.

ARTIST
No medals came to Fietlebnum,
No first or second prize.
He never drew a masterpiece
Admired by many eyes.
No galleries ever hung his work,
No hats were held aloft
When he held exhibitions
He drew on tablecloths.

BETTER YET
"BERLIN—Bread made from wood
is the latest achievement, of Prof.
Friedrich Bergius, noted German
scientist and winner of the Nobel
prize for chemistry in 1931, a co
worker of Bergius revealed today."
—S.F. Examiner.
Good wifie, dear.
Your biscuits here
Surpass synthetic bread
That's made in crocks
From wooden blocks—
For you turn dough to lead!
