Mil. lIAMPDEN OF THE OI.I)
SCHOOL. Observations upon the
recent appearance of a star.
I suspect that Mr. Walter Hamp
j den is a victim of Indolence, that
! insidious malady to which most ac
tors who have established reputa
| tions over a series of years, fall vic
tim.
So far as I know, only one actor
1 has been cither sufficiently astute
j to recognize the fact or sufficiently
j candid to admit it. In his amusing
; "Confessions of an Actor," pub-
I lished several years ago, John
Barrymore frankly admits an inher
; ent inertia and comments upon the
difficulty of arousing himself to
work. But Barrymore has obviously
overcome the handicap with the re
cent aid of roles worthy of his at
tention, and he has been seen in a
| series of increasingly line charac
i terizations.
Now Mr. Hampden has proved
that he has a great deal of ability.
His delineation of Cyrano last year
showed him to be an extremely ca
pable, if only faintly humorous, ac
tor. But in his more recent appear
ance as Caponsacchi, his perform
ance was lifeless and flaccid; In*
seemed resigned to something, quite
foreign to the play, which occupied
all of his attention. His fine voice
penetrated to every cranny of the
theatre but said nothing when it got
(here, a magnificent and meaning
| less sound.
It is possible that Hampden was
'striving for subtlety by understate
ment; if so, his playing and direc
tion were so subtle as to be color
less, for even subtlety must be ex
pressed with sufficient clarity and

[emphasis to reach across the foot
lights.
Further, Mr. Hampden seems to
have followed the tradition of tin'
last century by surrounding himself
with poor players, supposedly under
(he delusion that the star shines
more brilliantly in contrast. Hamp
den did place somewhat more com
petent players in one or two of the
more important, roles, probably that
they might aid in building his cli
maxes, without appearing to assume
sufficient of the burden to warrant
any serious critical attention.
This accusation is by no means a
new one: it has been staled and re
stated almost every time in recent
years that one of that genre known
as the grand old school has made an
appearance. It may be unfair, but
in view of the substantial evidence
and the obvious possibility of ob
taining a good cast (witness the line
production made by Katherine Cor
nell ■<)!' "The Barretts of Wimpole
Street"), particularly in these un
dog days, it seems the only tenable
conclusion. —San doe
