Nort Thornton, who does the tu
toring for Stanford's undefeated
band of water poloists, and who
with his modification of the famed
Hungarian system of play brought
his men to such a state of perfec
tion that they are ranked as the
ace-high collegiate team, has gone
afield from the usual run of compe
tition and bitten off a huge hunk of
opposition.
It amounts to no less than the
L.A.A.C. seven that represented
America against the world last
year in the Olympics, losing only
one game and that to the victori
ous Hungarian crew. Over
shadowed by the gloss and glam
our of a Stanford-S.C. track dual
Saturday, a large number of Farm
sport connoisseurs may he in
clined to forge! that in this three
game series of aquatic tangles
there ought to sprout some of the
best sports fare in this locality for
many moons.
Looking over the club roster, one
gains a few interesting sidelights.
For instance, the town of Venice
focms to be a veritable incubator
for water poloists. The three Dau- ,
henspeck brothers, Phil, Richard, ;
artel Earl, along with Walt O'Connor, j
former Stanford player, and Nort
Thornton, the present Stanford 1
coach, all grew up and played to
gether in Venice. The Los Angeles
loam is made up completely of Ven
ice and Long Beach High School
alumni.
Herbert Wildman, their star goal- ;
keeper, also a Venice High student,
made a name for himself in the last
Olympics when he shut off six al
most certain scores on penalty shots.
Oti a penalty shot, I understand,
they give the* offended side a free
shot from four feet in front of the
goal, with nothing to stop the ball
from going in, but one lonely and
miserable goal-keeper.
Wall O'Connor, former Stanford
man, is the veteran of the team,
and has played in three Olympic
Games meets. He is the L.A.A.C.
sprint star and high-point man.
The three-game series has been 1
so .scheduled to avoid conflict with
1 lie track meet Saturday, or the
water carnival Friday. The first |
game i.s to start at 3:15 o'clock di- i
rectly after the carnival events on
Frida>. and the second game will be
played at 1 o'clock Saturday beforel
the track meet. If a third game is j
required it will be played at 4:45 I
o'clock at the conclusion of the track
and field events.
