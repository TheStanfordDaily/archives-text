# Thornhill Sends Gridders Through Heavy Drills
## NEW PLAYS USED BY CARDS AS BIG SQUAD WORKS OUT 
### Oliver Johnston 
"Come on gang, huddle. Fifty-two
jon the first number." With five
1 quarterbacks yelling out these fa
| miliar phrases, one can easily sur
j mise that Thornhill i.s really begin
| ning to drill the men on the plays
he will employ next fall.
Three baekfields ran through plays
( with only tackles charging in on the
defense. The ends and halves looked
| to be blocking well and the fullbacks
were making short bullet passes.
Three Baekfields Work
i The three groups which he
! worked most of the time were Af
i fllerbaugh at quarter, Stevens at
! full, and Sim and Van Dellen at
i halves on team A; Alustiza quarter,
| Grayson full, and White and Maentz
! at halves on team B; Lewis quarter,
Todd full, and Hamilton and Ries
ner halves, on team C.
The backs also were given some
! lessons on how to punt out of bounds
jen the one-yard line under the
tutelage of Ernie Nevers. Van Del
len and Bob Grayson look as if they
i would acquire the habit without
I overtime work.
Tackling Is Stressed
The line spent most of the after
noon on tackling. Tiny also worked
the linemen on the dummy where,
with Bill Corbus demonstrating, he .
had them pulling out of the line at
top speed.
There seems to be a great deal
more enthusiasm than is usually ex
hibited in a spring spractice, which
should warm the hearts of the Stan
ford supporters.
