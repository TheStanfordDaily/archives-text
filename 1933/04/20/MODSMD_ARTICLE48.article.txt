# BADE RELAY TEAM NEEDS 440 RUNNER FOR FRESNO MEET
## 
### 
Stanford's chances for sending a
freshman medley relay team to the
Fresno Relays on May 13 depend on
finding a fourth man. At present
there are three top-notch men all
set for competition in the only eve
ning track competition of the season.
Frosh Track Captain Nimmo
would hold down ihe mile section
of the medley event. He is now
rated a Class A1 distance prospect
since his 4:23.5, which set a new
record in the Little Big Meet.
Davis to Run SBO
Lloyd Davis will take care of the
880 section. Davis' best time is
around 2:02. which is very respec
tably fast.
One 440-man would be Truck Del
linger. who came through with a
Little Big Meet win last year in 52.2
seconds to beat out California'.; Ba
gnasacco, supposed tape-breaker.
Quarter-Miler Needed
Another quarter - miler i.s still
needed. Johnny Reisner is capable
along these lines and may be per
suaded to run. Iron Man Klopsttick,
who seemed to finish strong in three
races week after week all season,
may be converted to a 440-runner,
although he is primarily a champion
hurdler. MeKenzie, Harper, and
Hartmann are other one-lap men of
ability.
