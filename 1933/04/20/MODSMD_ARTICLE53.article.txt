## 
### Jack Newman 
With the California intercollegiate
golf championship safely in their
team's possession, the Stanford golf
ers are now pointing toward the all -
University golf tournament which
Coach Eddie Twiggs has announced
as starting with qualifying rounds
on Sunday, April 23.
Every campus golfer is eligible to
play in this event. The forgotten
graduate and the ostracized frosh
will all match shots with the mem
bers of the championship varsity
team.
.'52 To Be Chosen
From the qualifying rounds which
start April 23 and end April 29, 32
men are to be selected to clash
mashies in the following rounds of
match play for the championship.
The first are to finish by May 7, the
second by May 14, and the quarter
finals by May 21. The semi-finals
will be fought out before May 28
and the finals of 36 holes are to be
played on June 7.
Dopesters are all crossed up when
I hey try to figure the finalists. It is
certain Lawson Little, playing at
scratch in the Northern California
G.A, tournaments, will enter a
strong bid for the honors, but one
recalls he has fallen very hard at
previous times, notably this last in
tercollegiate when Gene Brown, his
teammate, slipped by him to win
the tournament. Gene is rated with
i seven-stroke handicap in the same 1
association.
Eichelberger a Possibility
Captain Harry Eichelberger, |
whom Brown defeated in the finals
to secure his crown, is considered
a possibility, as it is certain he will
do his best in his last year of varsity
competition. He plays three handi- 1
cap in the association. Stew Hawley,
who recently returned to the cam
pus from Claremont, will attempt to I

I show himself worth his rating of two
j in the association's books.
Right along with these contenders
comes Tom Dwyer, who shot the
; medal scores in the qualifying
rounds of the intercollegiate. Don
1 Edwards of the frosh is doing big
; things these days. Last week in a
practice round he went 4-3-3-3-4 on
I the first holes.
