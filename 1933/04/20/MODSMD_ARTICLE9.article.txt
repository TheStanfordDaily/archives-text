# Card Mermen To Meet Club
## Indians Battle L.A. Team In Charity Series 
### Willard Bungay 
Bringing the strongest group of
players ever to represent the United
States in Olympic competition, the
water polo team of the Los Ange
les Athletic Club will open a three
game series with the Stanford team
here at 3:15 o'clock tomorrow.
The second game will be at 1
o'clock Saturday, and the third con
test, if necessary, will be played at
4:15.
Games Played for Charity
Proceeds of the games, for which
a 25-cent admission charge will be
made, will go to the Convalescent
Home.
The three Daubcnspeck broth
| ers. All-American Phil, Earl, and
! Rich, form the nucleus of the
L.A.A.C. team, which represented
the United States in last year's
! Olympics.
Stanford's only chance of beating
the club septet lies in the fact that
Coach Nort Thornton's team uses
the Hungarian fast-breaking system
iof attack. Hungary, the only team
i to defeat the clubmen, beat them
7 to 1. The L.A.A.C. has victories
over Brazil, Japan, and a tie with
Germany to its credit.
All-Star Aggregation
Two members of the starting line
up, Dutch McAllister, All-American
I last year, and Cal Strong, played on
j Stanford teams. McAllister cap
| taincd the 1925 Card team and
| Strong was captain in 1928. Other
' players with the club team are Bill
| Hoffman, forward, Earl Graham,
guard, Herb Wildman, goal guard,
and Wally O'Connor, substitute for
ward.
The feature of the games should
be the sprint race for the tip off
between Ted Wiget and Phil Dau
bcnspeck. Wigct's reputation is
well known and Daubcnspeck held
the National A.A.U. 50-yard free
j style title before this event was
discontinued.
Austen Clapp, Card captain la. 1 -!
I year, who played for the L.A.A.C.
| during the Olympic Games, believes
the clubmen should win each game
by from three to five goals. He be
i lieves the Stanford system of attack
jis superior, but that the veteran
i Mcrcurians will be too strong for
j the Indians.
j The Card starting lineup will
i include Ted Wiget at sprint, Jim
: Triolo and cither Dick llirsch or
Jim Bcnet at forward, Don Kin
kcad, centcrback, Vlad Taranik
and Gordon Graves, guards, and
Captain Burke Knapp at goal
guard.
An added feature of Friday's game
I will be Stanford swimming captain
| Fred Tebbett's attempt to break
(George Fissler's National A.A.U.
: 400-meter backstroke record of 5:
52.8. Tebbett established a new 50-
yard short course National A.A.U.
record last Saturday.
Central Chilean volcanoes give
j indications of intense activity in the
'near future.
