# Die-Hards Protest Indians May Still Take Trojan Meet
## Annual S.C.-Card Trackfest Scheduled for Tomorrow At 2:30 o'clock in Stadium; Dope Forecasts Troy Victory, But Upset Possible 
### FRANCIS HAMILTON 
11/ lIEN the sons of Troy and the sons of the Red enter the field for the
Stanford-U.S.C. track meet at 2o'clock tomorrow, a gigantic figura
tive tjucstion-mark will hang over Stanford Stadium. Shrouded in a mist
of speculation, the outcome of the meeting remains to the last moment the
deepest of mysteries.
By all rights and reason, the laurels will go to Southern California. Hut
such has been the speculation, so many interpretations of the possibilities
have been fostered, that the meet which was oncu conceded to the Trojans,
even with the peerless Ben Eastman striding the lanes, has evolved into
the maddest mix-up of recent years.
Now the bumptious critics are who apprehend a Stanford team, sans
Ben Eastman, sans Jimmy Willson, sans Don Blackmail, with a brace of
ailing pole-vault aces, booming forth to jolt the dual meet championship
out of the saddle of the Trojan horse where it has so long clung. Fellers,
that'.s a long shot, a 100 to 1 .shot;'*'

bul there remain those stubborn
souls who protest that it. is a shot
worth playing.
Critical Events
Opportunity of a Stanford victory
hinges on a few critical pegs where
anything can happen. Can Les
Hables beat out the fast-developing
Charley Parsons? It's a lot to de
mand of a man, who not so many
months ago was a physical wreck.
Can game little Phil Morentin strike
a winning pace against Foore in the
two-mile? Can Meier win the highs;
can Herbert break through in the
lows; will the quartet of weightmen
shut Troy out in the shot and dis
cus? Who knows what will happen
in the broad jump; can Phil Wil
liams— ? Aw, the whole darn
thing's a whirling crazy-quilt.
The Trojan is coming with thirty
four good men and true, of whom
ten won places against Stanford last
year and accounted for 29 of the
B'l'i S.C. points. They are primed
to crush this Cardinal threat for
once and for all. And all admit if
Stanford does not turn the trick this
year they never will, that is, not for
a season or two at; any rate.
What will the result he? iVli\ up
your own hatch of numbers and
draw them out of a hat. '( lie Daily
"experts" have guessed a Stan
ford victory, (it! to (>3. Harlow
Uothcrt, a saner and more mature
guesser, says SC. will win, 72-5!).
Not in a college generation has the
Cardinal seen a track victory over
the Trojan. Not since 1929 when
the Cardinal triumphed 74 to 57 has
Stanford returned a winner. But the
prediction is, the eager ones will
have to wait until tomorrow, when
the cool of late afternoon descends
upon the Stadium, battle ground of
many a titanic Trojan-Indian strug
gle, and the spectators await the
running of the relay to decide the
meet. And if it comes to that, watch
the brown legs of "Lucky" Los
Hables churn, as he rounds the oval
on his last shot at the Trojan Horse.

such has been the speculation, so many interpretations of the possibilities
have been fostered, that the meet which was oncu conceded to the Trojans,
even with the peerless Ben Eastman striding the lanes, has evolved into
the maddest mix-up of recent years.
Now the bumptious critics are who apprehend a Stanford team, sans
Ben Eastman, sans Jimmy Willson, sans Don Blackmail, with a brace of
ailing pole-vault aces, booming forth to jolt the dual meet championship
out of the saddle of the Trojan horse where it has so long clung. Fellers,
that'.s a long shot, a 100 to 1 .shot;'*'

bul there remain those stubborn
souls who protest that it. is a shot
worth playing.
Critical Events
Opportunity of a Stanford victory
hinges on a few critical pegs where
anything can happen. Can Les
Hables beat out the fast-developing
Charley Parsons? It's a lot to de
mand of a man, who not so many
months ago was a physical wreck.
Can game little Phil Morentin strike
a winning pace against Foore in the
two-mile? Can Meier win the highs;
can Herbert break through in the
lows; will the quartet of weightmen
shut Troy out in the shot and dis
cus? Who knows what will happen
in the broad jump; can Phil Wil
liams— ? Aw, the whole darn
thing's a whirling crazy-quilt.
The Trojan is coming with thirty
four good men and true, of whom
ten won places against Stanford last
year and accounted for 29 of the
B'l'i S.C. points. They are primed
to crush this Cardinal threat for
once and for all. And all admit if
Stanford does not turn the trick this
year they never will, that is, not for
a season or two at; any rate.
What will the result he? iVli\ up
your own hatch of numbers and
draw them out of a hat. '( lie Daily
"experts" have guessed a Stan
ford victory, (it! to (>3. Harlow
Uothcrt, a saner and more mature
guesser, says SC. will win, 72-5!).
Not in a college generation has the
Cardinal seen a track victory over
the Trojan. Not since 1929 when
the Cardinal triumphed 74 to 57 has
Stanford returned a winner. But the
prediction is, the eager ones will
have to wait until tomorrow, when
the cool of late afternoon descends
upon the Stadium, battle ground of
many a titanic Trojan-Indian strug
gle, and the spectators await the
running of the relay to decide the
meet. And if it comes to that, watch
the brown legs of "Lucky" Los
Hables churn, as he rounds the oval
on his last shot at the Trojan Horse.

Stanford-U.S.C. track meet at 2o'clock tomorrow, a gigantic figura

deepest of mysteries.
