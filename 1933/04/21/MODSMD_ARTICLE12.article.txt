# Sales For '33 Quad Increase
## 
### 
Quad sales have jumped 15 per
cent since the New Deal began, and
; only a limited number of the Senior
' books remains available at this time,
according to announcement last [
night, by John Bunting, '315, man
ager.
"If we can sell out the copies we
; have now we will make a little
moneyâ€”a startling thing for a year
like 1933," he said. "Present .sales
. indicate a sell-out before publica
i lion date, and it is advisable for j
those who want the books to order 1
immediately."
Bunting added that if a prosper- |
tive customer is unable to raise the |
total price at this time, he may be |
able to place a deposit, in order to
reserve his copy.
