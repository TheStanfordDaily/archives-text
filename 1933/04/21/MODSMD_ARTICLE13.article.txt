# Revolution Rumbles As Farm Awaits Coronation
## 
### STAN BEAUBAIRE 
Murmurs, faint rumblings at first
. . . . ideas and then contemplated
action. What will happen before 11
o'clock tonight?
Men, roughs, big ones .... Dckes
. . . . who think that it would be u
fancy idea to stage a local revolu
tion before the coronation . . . .
place their man von Saltza on the
throne .... "kidnap"' Axe Nyeland
and Rose Cubbison sometime before
the big event ....
It's all pretty vague and unsettled
right now, but they are thinking.
. . . . Everyone, according to a Rally
Committee ruling, must wear masks.

. . . . Most will be heavily costumed.
.... Not a soul could tell who was
beneath a certain disguise until the
actual coronation by Engclman
King Nyeland or King von Saltza'.'
Queen Cubbison or Queen Loos.' Or
what if tHi> two combinations get
mixed up in the proceedings and
the grand master of the court
crowns Axe Nyland and Mary Anit.i
Loos? Or, when masks arc taken
<>(T, finds his victims were von Saltza
and Cubbison?
Be there at 11 at the very latest,
say campus wags. It'll be plenty of
fun watching for results.
