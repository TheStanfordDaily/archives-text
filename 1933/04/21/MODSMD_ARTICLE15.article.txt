Boys and girls together—
Dancing the light fantastic on the
| sidewalks of Podunk Center, Kan-
I sas, all the way to the banking
I houses on Wall Street, America yes
j terday took its first dose of the
| tonic, inflation.
The first official departure of the
i United States from the gold stand
j ard in more than fifty years was
felt throughout the entire economic
i structure.
Common stocks and the specu
lative' commodities maintained
i their dizzy flight skyward as Eu
rope started selling America short
on the exchange. The dollar sold
| at an estimated discount of 14%
i in terms of foreign moneys,
j Coincidentally high-grade bonds
j tumbled further as investigators
I rushed to take advantage of the bull
! market. Their lixed income returns
! would represent smaller purchasing
power should the cost of living ad
vance.
Predictions were issued in many
quarters that the dollar will eventu
ally be forced upward through the
operation of a favorable balance of
trade and the payment of foreign
j obligations.
Some observers, however, feared
that America's departure from the
i gold standard would precipitate
the world into a hectic race for the
! further depreciation of currencies
as each nation strove for relative
advantages in export trade,
i American exporters today reaped
the benefits of a depreciated cur
] rcncy as the advantage won by Eng
: land when that nation quit the gold
! standard hi 1931 was canceled.
! In a survey here last night, mem
j hers of the economics department
I in general expressed confidence, in
i the impending moves of the admin-
I ist ration.
Might Stop Short
Warnings were issued, however,
j that should the proposed inflation
i be mild and stop v/ith the stock
market and speculative commodi
| ties, not filtering through the eco
nomic set-up, little could be ex
pected in the way of an iniprovc-
I mrnt.
Conversely should the administra
i lion permit, inflation to get out of
I hand the nation might find itself
, plunged on the perilous road taken
! by Post-war France, It.ily, Germany,
j and Russia.
But should inflation go far
enough—and not too far—a gen
eral business recovery with coin
cident advances in employment,
wages, and prices, is to be ex
pected.
Meanwhile on Capitol Hill, demo
cratic leaders proceeded on their
three-point drive for inflation. The
| inflation bill, presented as an
amendment to the pending farm re
lief bill, would authorize the Treas
; ury to enter into agreements with
j the Federal Reserve to purchase
; three billions in government securi
j ti.s in open market operations.
These purchases would bolster
hank reserves and permit a huge
expansion of bank deposits, bail
ing that alternative llooscvelt
would l»e given authority to alter
the nold content of the dollar,
wearing the mantle <>r a virtual
monetary czar.
America's last chips are on the
table —the roulette wheel spins—
the little white hall hobs. When
that wheel stops and the little
white ball conies to rest, Americas
fate—for good or evil —is told.
