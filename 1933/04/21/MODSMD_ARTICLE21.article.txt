# Woman Gets Earful! in Attempt to intimidate Wet Palo Alto Merchant
## 
### 
The other evening the telephone rang in one of Palo
AKo's more popular eating places. A woman's voice asked
fo speak lo the proprietor.
'â€¢Hello/' Said thai individual, answering I lie phone as
anybody else would.
"This is Mrs.' said the voice. "Is il true llial you
are sympathetic with the movement How afoot: to legalize
the sale of heer in Palo Alto?"
"Yes," said the proprietor, answering like'the black
guard the woman's voice accused him of being.
"Well," hissed the irate female at the other end of a
perfect connection, "1 have eaten Sunday night supper in
your place regularly for two years, and let me say right
now that I'll never set foot inside your establishment
again."
Then the lady got an carfuH. The proprietor answered
her like die gentlemanly hut righteously indignant citizen
and business man of Palo Alto that he was. He told her
oil'straight, and he told her off it couldn't have
been better without "and now listen to the Stanford root
ing sect ion" lo follow his words. It's only too bad that there
was just one person on the other end of the wire. That
ipee< h would have been good medicine for a lot of people.
This incident was an example of attempted intimida
tion, nothing more. The crank who telephoned was what
might just as well be termed a liar. She was a liar because
neither the proprietor nor his employees could recollect
of ever having seen her in the cafe, and she was a crank,
not because she might have some honest objections lo the
use or sale of beer, but because she stooped to such a level
in an attempt lo put across her own solution of the local
heer question.
Yet that woman's telephone threat is not an isolated
example. Intimidation of Palo Alto merchants who advo
cate the sale of beer through a threatened boycott on their
business establishments has become a common weapon
among the town's rabid drys. The boycott weapon is often
effective, but it is often used with a boomerang result.
C.itizens of the Palo Alto-Stanford community, wet or dry,
would view with regret a double boycott, begun by the
intimidating efforts of a few independent members of the
"no beer fraterni I v."
