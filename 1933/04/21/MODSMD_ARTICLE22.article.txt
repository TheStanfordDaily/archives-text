# Judd Case Proves Again the Impracticability of "Expert" Witnesses
## 
### 
Winnie I *111h .ludd, promincn I American figure that slit* I
is, continues to command column after column of space !
in our daily papers. Her defense is based on that fine
American judicial conlorlion not guilty by reason of in
sanity.
Iler altorneys insist that she is insane and that practi
cally ;ill her ancestors died in padded cells. Not a very
pleasant picture, this, hut exceedingly necessary if their I
client is to he saved from the chair.
On the other hand the prosecution continues to assert j
that the "trunk murderess" is perfectly sane. Roth sides
base their contentions <>n the opinions of "expert" alienists.
I'sing virtually the same tests these "experts" manage to
arrive at opposite conclusions. This fact would seem to j
prove either that it is impossible to properly judge insanity '
or that the alienists know on which side their bread is
buttered. Knowing the advances that science has made in
studying the human brain, one would incline to the latter
conclusion.
Nor is the .ludd case an isolated one. Practically every
murder case within memory has degenerated into a child-j
i*h disagreement between these "expert" alienists. We i
must, of course, except tin 1 Zangara case.
There is one obvious solution to the problem. All alien-!
ists, and other expert witnesses, should be men of reeog- j
nized standing and should be retained by the court.
