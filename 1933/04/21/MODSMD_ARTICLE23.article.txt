# BULL SESSION
## THE 						LAST ACE IN THE NEW DEAL 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
$100,000 per year Dealer-Extraor- I
1 j dinary Franklin D. Roosevelt sat
| down to the National card-table on
I March 4th. He .shuffled the cards,
• ] ignored the Congressional demand
to cut, and began his deal. The Ace
of Diamonds—banking reform. The
Ace .of Clulxs —beating down the
budget appropriations. The Ace of
1 Hearts —beer.
Tight-lipped Roosevelt-opponent
Depression sat firm with his three
year-old leer of victory untouched. |
The Dealer smiled in return and
yesterday flicked his trump card—
j the Ace of Spades—inflation—to the
j table. Without altering his smile for
a moment, he is backing the last Ace
with every remaining "blue chip"
at America's command.
i
By inflation, Roosevelt hopes to
' do what years of hopeful waiting
I for the natural forces of recovery
have failed to do. He hopes to
I about-face the price level and start
! i' toward the heights of 1929 from
j which it has been falling for years.
I Some people in a calloused burst of
'realism have suggested war as the
j golden key to prosperity. Roose
, veltiah cheapening of the money
will have the same general effect.
1 As money falls, prices rise. Post
j war Germany was the ultimate of
| inflation.
I' ! 1
i Roosevelt, however, plans to con
j tvol the rise of prices. If he can, he
! wins, if he can't we lose. The future
; of our economic life is in the hands
! of the President. The conservative
thing to do is to wait and pray for
j something to happen. The Roosevelt
way Ls dangerous, but the people
are ready for dangerous proposals.
But, croon the Socialists, n is oniy
j temporary. It will only be followed
by another depression. That, doesn't
worry the people in the least. They
leave the Socialists to ponder the
! terrific consequences. Everyone
wants recovery NOW—the future j
I be blasted. Inflation may be able to [
j lift the country from the evil-smell
f'ing mire of extended financial panic. 1
! That, is all that matters now.
1 * >
According to our remembrance of
Ely—high-god of sophomore eco
nomics, when prices rise, people
I buy. It seems buyers are afraid j
prices will go higher. People buy;
production goes up; labor is hired; j

l consumption goes higher; production
goes higher. The merry whirl be
gins and prosperity is here—for the
moment at least.
Inflation is supposed to hurt the
creditors, which is true. It lowers
the absolute value of their security.
But conversely, the possibility of
ever collecting anything is en
hanced. In the long run, those that
( have will have more.
i Glonoin injected in tin- heart will
I bring a dead man to life for 15 min
utes. Inflation is economic' glonoin.

Whether the "life" can last lunger
than "10 minutes" depends on how
much control there is in Roosevelt's
controlled inflation.

According to our remembrance of

goes higher. The merry whirl be
gins and prosperity is here—for the
moment at least.
Inflation is supposed to hurt the
creditors, which is true. It lowers
the absolute value of their security.
