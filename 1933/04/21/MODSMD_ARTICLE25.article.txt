WASHINGTON—Coming to Con
gress last December, the Hon. Fran
cis H. Shoemaker, a Minnesota
Farmer-Labor man, who lately left
Leavenworth penitentiary, offered
his pet quip: "A lot of you fellows
go from Congress to the peniten
tiary; I'm the only guy that came
from the penitentiary to Congress. '
—News item.
I'm new in this lawmaking den—
lint shouldn't you trade places
when
Your legalized junk
And political hunk
Puts halos on guys in (he pen?
