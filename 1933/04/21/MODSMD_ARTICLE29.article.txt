# Stubborn Indian Ready To Upset S. C. Trackmen
## 
### 
l'.\ ALHEIM' GUERARD, JR.
When Les Ilables digs his holes
for tin l 100 and 220, when Gus Meier
and Cotto Herbert skim over the
hurdles, warming up for the two
harrier events, when Phil Williams,
Paul /.aches, and Laurel Lewis start
marking off their "steps" in the
broad jump, and when injured Bill
Miller and Bud Deacon take their
first hoists at the pole vault cross
bar—
Hold your breath and pray for the
breaks.
On the legs of these eight men
depend Stanford's chance of doing
the impossible, and turning the 66-
65 trick which is so optimistically
predicted in the fancy jjope sheet on
page 5.
An analysis of the fifteen events
to be contested shows that an East
man-less Stanford track team must
"come through" to win in every
event, and even then count on more
than a 50-50 share of the "breaks."
Here's how it might happen:
SPRINTS—The sprinting duels
between courageous Les Hables
and Charley Parsons. U.S.C.'s son
of a champion, have been billed to
the skies as the meet's feature
events. Hables is the faster starter
of the two, Parsons stays behind
for fifty yards, gets under way at
this point, and is always going
awa> at the finish. A double vic
tory for either man is conceivable.
In I ,(is Angeles, Parsons is picked
to win both.
The Daily says as much for Hables.
Impartial observers predict Parsons
will win the 100, and lose the 220
to Stanford's "fastest human."
S.C. Has Reserve Man
Les Ball and Frank Lombardi will
battle for the odd point in both the
century and furlong, with odds fa
voring the U.S.C. entry. In the 100-
yard dash, U.S.C. has an additional
entry in Alf Koenig, saving Osborne
for the longer dash.
QUARTER — Almost universal
agreement limits Stanford to three
points in this event, conceding
U.S.C.'s Ed Ablowich a first place
over Indian A1 Blackman. Ablowich
was a member of the Olympic team,
but he will have to show improve
ment over his first 1933 rages if he
expects to lead Blackman lo the
tape. The latter is an ideal "spot";
he is not expected to win, but he
has a good chance of turning the
trick. Art Rice is not picked to win
the third place from Cotton War
burton and Harry Tompkins, but
here again an upset is possible.
Cassin Favored in 880
HALF-MILE—U.S.C.'s crack half
milet's, Jim Cassin and Ferris Web
ster, barring accident, will finish
ahead of Stanford's three entries.
Dan Murphy, Sam Eastman, and
George Naylon will be fighting to
nose cut Norene, the third best
U.S.C. 880 man.
MILE—Francis Benavidez rates as
an almost certain winner here, un
less his teammate Dave Foore
chooses to run. Jim Ferries chances
i I upsetting the olive-skinned Tro
jan depend on how fast a pace the
U.S.C. milers choose to set. Gran
ville Ashcraft and Chuck Saffell of
U.S.C., and Prentice Messimer of
Stanford will also compete.
TWO-MILE — Surprising to
some, perhaps, is the failure to
mention the two-mile as a crucial
event. Stanfordites are fairly con
fident that Phil Morentin will run
the legs ofT Foore of Los Angeles
in spite of the hitter's !):44.6 race
turned in several weeks ago. But
the margin should be less than
ten \nrds. Art V/evedo wil have

! to go under ten minutes to' take
(lie odd point from Winn and
Cutler of U.S.C.
IH'RDLES—A question-mark the
size of a hundred hurdles surrounds
the two timber-topping races. Is
i Gus Meier's leg fully mended? If
i the answer is yes, the Stanford ace
' can win the highs and take a third
in the lows. On the other hand, the
mediocre performances of Trojan
barrier men throughout the season
must be discounted. They will be
ready as never before to win on
1 Saturday. U.S.C. banks on Bob
Lyon, Wes Berry, and Captain Jeddy
Welsh in the highs, and Norman
Paul in the lows. Paul is the most
consistent "under 24-second" low
hurdler in the world, although Cotto
Herbert's best time would have
them match stride for stride.
Relay Is Important
RELAY—Give it to U.S.C. with
out question if the result has no.
bearing on the meet. If the meet

hinges on it, Les Hables will run,
and A1 Blackman will run faster
than he ever has before .... Put
your tongue in your cheek and
pick Stanford.
WEIGHTS—Heuston Harper is
counted on by Trojan supporters
to take a third, perhaps a second,
in the shot put. If Stanford is to
have a ghost of a chance of win
ning tlie meet, however, he must
go unplaced behind Stanford's
Dunn. Gray, and Lyman in the
shot, and Laborde, Dunn, and
Gray in the discus.
JAVELIN — Another close one.
Stanford expects Johnny Mottram
to win, while U.S.C. is betting on
Kenneth McKenzie. Both schools
agree Frank Williamson will take
third. Every member of this trio has
thrown 200 feet at one time or an
other.
Scl;ween May Surprise
IHGII JUMP—Olympic Champion
Malcolm McNaughton has slipped
badly since his 6-foot„ 7-inch jumps
of last summer. Lloyd Schween is
marked down for a third, but he
might gain a tie with the "world's
best jumper." Bob Von Osdel is al
most certain to win.
BROAD JlJlVll*—Just who's who
in the broad jump is a problem fit
only for the most astute of crystal
gazers. U.S.C.'s crop of champion
broad-jumpers has not done any
better than Stanford's trio, Zaches,
Williams, Lewis. The Trojans must
be favored on the basis of their
sterling performances in 1932.
POLE VAULT—BiII Miller and
Bud Deacon of Stanford; Bill Gra
l>cr of U.S.C. Miller still walks on
crutches with the meet 24 hours
off; Deacon hopes his leg won't
Rive out; Grahcr is the most in
consistent polc-vaulter in the
game. All three vaulters may tie
at 12 feet, or they might very well
tie at 14 feet. G inches. One guess
is as good as another.

Malcolm McNaughton has slipped
badly since his 6-foot„ 7-inch jumps
of last summer. Lloyd Schween is
marked down for a third, but he

best jumper." Bob Von Osdel is al
most certain to win.
BROAD JlJlVll*—Just who's who
in the broad jump is a problem fit
only for the most astute of crystal
gazers. U.S.C.'s crop of champion
broad-jumpers has not done any
better than Stanford's trio, Zaches,
Williams, Lewis. The Trojans must
be favored on the basis of their
sterling performances in 1932.

and Cotto Herbert skim over the
hurdles, warming up for the two
harrier events, when Phil Williams,
Paul /.aches, and Laurel Lewis start
marking off their "steps" in the
broad jump, and when injured Bill
Miller and Bud Deacon take their
first hoists at the pole vault cross
bar—
Hold your breath and pray for the
breaks.
On the legs of these eight men
depend Stanford's chance of doing
the impossible, and turning the 66-
65 trick which is so optimistically
predicted in the fancy jjope sheet on
page 5.
An analysis of the fifteen events
to be contested shows that an East
man-less Stanford track team must
"come through" to win in every
event, and even then count on more
than a 50-50 share of the "breaks."
Here's how it might happen:
SPRINTS—The sprinting duels
between courageous Les Hables
and Charley Parsons. U.S.C.'s son
of a champion, have been billed to
the skies as the meet's feature
events. Hables is the faster starter
of the two, Parsons stays behind
for fifty yards, gets under way at
this point, and is always going
awa> at the finish. A double vic
tory for either man is conceivable.
In I ,(is Angeles, Parsons is picked
to win both.
The Daily says as much for Hables.
Impartial observers predict Parsons
will win the 100, and lose the 220
to Stanford's "fastest human."
S.C. Has Reserve Man
Les Ball and Frank Lombardi will
battle for the odd point in both the
century and furlong, with odds fa
voring the U.S.C. entry. In the 100-
yard dash, U.S.C. has an additional
entry in Alf Koenig, saving Osborne
for the longer dash.
QUARTER — Almost universal
agreement limits Stanford to three
points in this event, conceding
U.S.C.'s Ed Ablowich a first place
over Indian A1 Blackman. Ablowich
was a member of the Olympic team,
but he will have to show improve
ment over his first 1933 rages if he
expects to lead Blackman lo the
tape. The latter is an ideal "spot";
he is not expected to win, but he
has a good chance of turning the
trick. Art Rice is not picked to win
the third place from Cotton War
burton and Harry Tompkins, but
here again an upset is possible.

HALF-MILE—U.S.C.'s crack half
milet's, Jim Cassin and Ferris Web
ster, barring accident, will finish

Dan Murphy, Sam Eastman, and
George Naylon will be fighting to
nose cut Norene, the third best
U.S.C. 880 man.

an almost certain winner here, un

chooses to run. Jim Ferries chances

jan depend on how fast a pace the
U.S.C. milers choose to set. Gran

U.S.C., and Prentice Messimer of

event. Stanfordites are fairly con
fident that Phil Morentin will run
the legs ofT Foore of Los Angeles

and Charley Parsons. U.S.C.'s son
of a champion, have been billed to
the skies as the meet's feature
events. Hables is the faster starter
of the two, Parsons stays behind
for fifty yards, gets under way at
this point, and is always going
awa> at the finish. A double vic
tory for either man is conceivable.
In I ,(is Angeles, Parsons is picked
to win both.
The Daily says as much for Hables.
Impartial observers predict Parsons
will win the 100, and lose the 220
to Stanford's "fastest human."
S.C. Has Reserve Man
Les Ball and Frank Lombardi will
battle for the odd point in both the
century and furlong, with odds fa
voring the U.S.C. entry. In the 100-
yard dash, U.S.C. has an additional
entry in Alf Koenig, saving Osborne
for the longer dash.
QUARTER — Almost universal
agreement limits Stanford to three
points in this event, conceding
U.S.C.'s Ed Ablowich a first place
over Indian A1 Blackman. Ablowich
was a member of the Olympic team,
but he will have to show improve
ment over his first 1933 rages if he
expects to lead Blackman lo the
tape. The latter is an ideal "spot";
he is not expected to win, but he
has a good chance of turning the
trick. Art Rice is not picked to win
the third place from Cotton War
burton and Harry Tompkins, but
here again an upset is possible.
Cassin Favored in 880
HALF-MILE—U.S.C.'s crack half
milet's, Jim Cassin and Ferris Web
ster, barring accident, will finish
ahead of Stanford's three entries.
Dan Murphy, Sam Eastman, and
George Naylon will be fighting to
nose cut Norene, the third best
U.S.C. 880 man.
MILE—Francis Benavidez rates as
an almost certain winner here, un
less his teammate Dave Foore
chooses to run. Jim Ferries chances
i I upsetting the olive-skinned Tro
jan depend on how fast a pace the
U.S.C. milers choose to set. Gran
ville Ashcraft and Chuck Saffell of
U.S.C., and Prentice Messimer of
Stanford will also compete.
TWO-MILE — Surprising to
some, perhaps, is the failure to
mention the two-mile as a crucial
event. Stanfordites are fairly con
fident that Phil Morentin will run
the legs ofT Foore of Los Angeles
in spite of the hitter's !):44.6 race
turned in several weeks ago. But
the margin should be less than
ten \nrds. Art V/evedo wil have

! to go under ten minutes to' take
(lie odd point from Winn and
Cutler of U.S.C.
IH'RDLES—A question-mark the
size of a hundred hurdles surrounds
the two timber-topping races. Is
i Gus Meier's leg fully mended? If
i the answer is yes, the Stanford ace
' can win the highs and take a third
in the lows. On the other hand, the
mediocre performances of Trojan
barrier men throughout the season
must be discounted. They will be
ready as never before to win on
1 Saturday. U.S.C. banks on Bob
Lyon, Wes Berry, and Captain Jeddy
Welsh in the highs, and Norman
Paul in the lows. Paul is the most
consistent "under 24-second" low
hurdler in the world, although Cotto
Herbert's best time would have
them match stride for stride.

bearing on the meet. If the meet

hinges on it, Les Hables will run,

your tongue in your cheek and

WEIGHTS—Heuston Harper is
counted on by Trojan supporters
to take a third, perhaps a second,
in the shot put. If Stanford is to
have a ghost of a chance of win
ning tlie meet, however, he must
go unplaced behind Stanford's
Dunn. Gray, and Lyman in the
shot, and Laborde, Dunn, and
Gray in the discus.
JAVELIN — Another close one.
Stanford expects Johnny Mottram
to win, while U.S.C. is betting on
Kenneth McKenzie. Both schools
agree Frank Williamson will take
third. Every member of this trio has
thrown 200 feet at one time or an
other.

IHGII JUMP—Olympic Champion
Malcolm McNaughton has slipped
badly since his 6-foot„ 7-inch jumps
of last summer. Lloyd Schween is
marked down for a third, but he
might gain a tie with the "world's
best jumper." Bob Von Osdel is al
most certain to win.
BROAD JlJlVll*—Just who's who
in the broad jump is a problem fit
only for the most astute of crystal
gazers. U.S.C.'s crop of champion
broad-jumpers has not done any
better than Stanford's trio, Zaches,
Williams, Lewis. The Trojans must
be favored on the basis of their
sterling performances in 1932.
POLE VAULT—BiII Miller and
Bud Deacon of Stanford; Bill Gra

crutches with the meet 24 hours

to take a third, perhaps a second,
in the shot put. If Stanford is to
have a ghost of a chance of win
ning tlie meet, however, he must
go unplaced behind Stanford's
Dunn. Gray, and Lyman in the
shot, and Laborde, Dunn, and
Gray in the discus.
JAVELIN — Another close one.
Stanford expects Johnny Mottram
to win, while U.S.C. is betting on
Kenneth McKenzie. Both schools
agree Frank Williamson will take
third. Every member of this trio has
thrown 200 feet at one time or an
other.
Scl;ween May Surprise
IHGII JUMP—Olympic Champion
Malcolm McNaughton has slipped
badly since his 6-foot„ 7-inch jumps
of last summer. Lloyd Schween is
marked down for a third, but he
might gain a tie with the "world's
best jumper." Bob Von Osdel is al
most certain to win.
BROAD JlJlVll*—Just who's who
in the broad jump is a problem fit
only for the most astute of crystal
gazers. U.S.C.'s crop of champion
broad-jumpers has not done any
better than Stanford's trio, Zaches,
Williams, Lewis. The Trojans must
be favored on the basis of their
sterling performances in 1932.
POLE VAULT—BiII Miller and
Bud Deacon of Stanford; Bill Gra
l>cr of U.S.C. Miller still walks on
crutches with the meet 24 hours
off; Deacon hopes his leg won't
Rive out; Grahcr is the most in
consistent polc-vaulter in the
game. All three vaulters may tie
at 12 feet, or they might very well
tie at 14 feet. G inches. One guess
is as good as another.
