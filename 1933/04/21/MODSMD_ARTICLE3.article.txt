another outlandish costume ....
Wear anything you want, come
when you please, but all who enter
the Pavilion tonight will be required
to be properly masked regardless of
other attire. Costumes will be rented
at the Pavilion from 1 to 5 o'clock
this afternoon, and if finances are
low, it is recommended that home
made costumes are every bit as ori
ginal and just as effective.
As Axe Nyland declared that his
inaugural address will ask "Why
Be Educated?" Master of Cere
nations Knglcman added that all
guests will be asked to sit in the
balconies while the ceremony is in
progress tonight. The verbal por
tion of the affair promises to be
very amusing and all are asked to
maintain silence in order that it
may be heard.
In view of the fact that it is not.
too late to make dates or secure
costumes for the affair, the Rally
1 Committee announces that a few
bids rre still on sale in the A.S.S.U.
offices in the Old Union at $1.50
per couple. The affair is scheduled
from 9 until 1 o'clock.
