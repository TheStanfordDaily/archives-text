Due to the fact that I do not know
several of the athletes on both the
Stanford and U.S.C. teams, I cer
tainly do not feel qualified to pre
dict the outcome of the individual
events of the meet Saturday. In
compiling a dope sheet it is interest
ing to note that the outcome of sev
eral events is decidedly uncertain.
I think the sprints are a toss-up,
with Hablcs the slight favorite. The
pole vault, due to the condition of

Miller and Deacon, is also very un
certain. In my opinion the broad
jump is anybody's event and the
hurdles also are liable to be won
by either team, with Paul and Lyons
favored because of better records in
early season meets.
The U.S.C.-Stanford meets have
been the best dual meets in the
country for several years and Sat
urday's will be no exception. Either
team could win, but at the present
time it seems to me that U.S.C. has
a slight edge. When one tries to
predict a score he realizes how close
practically all the events will be.
