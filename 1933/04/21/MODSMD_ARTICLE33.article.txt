# Craig's Cardinals To Play For May 5 Encina Formal
## 
### 
Craig's Cardinals have been defi
nitely chosen by Bill Drew, Encina
Club dance chairman, to play for
the club formal on May 5. The Car
dinals, at one time a premier or
chestra on the Farm, have been ab
sent for several years, and their first
reappearance was at the recent
A.T.O. formal.
Returning with Craig is a ten
piece orchestra which has been sea
soned by play at Mills and Berkeley
dances. Soloists and, a vocal trio are
some of the attractions. 1
