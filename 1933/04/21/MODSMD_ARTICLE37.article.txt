## Dopester Durkee Comes Back to Town 
### 
Being employed by Dink Temple
ts n, the B.A.C. and other vested in
terests of Northern California to
pick up seven or eight points for
Stanford in tomorrow's track meet
with the S.C. boys, I am somewhat
relieved to run into Dopester Dur
kee, who is looking for cigar butts
in the gutters of Palo Alto while I
am engaged on my similar search
or the Lost Points.
Dopster lias dropped down from
liis lofty habitat in the hidden hills
on iiis customary pilgrimage to see
(he track tussle between the In
dian and Trojan hosts. A great
advocate of Indian civilization, re
cent disappointments have made
Dopster cynical. Covered with gold
dust (which I learn upon investi
gation to he soap and not metal),
Dopester bites oil' the end of the
cigar that I offer him from my
well-filled pocket and begins to
chew one half and to stuff the
other in his brecehcs' pocket be
fore he says:
"What of S.C.? Well, I'll tell you,
Dick. On paper, I hoy don't look so
hot. But I kinda figure that they
have a cnuplo oj 57-foot shot-put
tc'ivt;who until tomorrowj, will have
be6p liMlat sprinters and that three
of their who have prob
ably broken Big Ben's 440 record by
three or four seconds will be able
to run."
