# OLD DOPESTER HAS THE DIRT ON STANFORD

"Now you take the broad-jump,
Dick," he continued. "Of course, I
have no proof of my statement, bul
past circumstances would indicate
that tlic Japanese Olympic team
would be broad-jumping over 25
feet for Dean Cromwell tmoorrow.
And S.C.'s admission that Foore has
run 9:43 indicates that Foore has
broken nine minutes at least twice
this year."
At that I told Dopcster he was a
damned cynic, and walked away
in disgust. Hut the Grand Old Man
of track shuffled after me.
"I got some dope on Stanford, too,"
bo said pleadingly, .the disappointed,
anxious look of p for whom, you
refuse to throw 'a stick any longer
in his faded eyes.
'"ft seems to me," he went on.
"that lien Eastman and his hoys
can outlutp any other crutches
track team in the country. There
are four Olympic team-members
at Stanford, and what has hap
pened to them? I'll tell you what:
Eastman is out with a pulled
muscle; Rill Miller lias a stone
bruise on his heel that makes run
ning that pole-vault path and
landing in the pit no fun; Nellie
Gray's pulled back-muscle is only
partially healed, and . . .
"Yes, I know. You were about to
say that Don Blackmail is out with
Ihose pesky feet of his again and
that Jimmy Willson's leg has given
way for good and that Bud Dcacon,
like Miller, has been unable to vault
all week."
"That's just it," Old Dopester said
â– jmrtefulfy.
