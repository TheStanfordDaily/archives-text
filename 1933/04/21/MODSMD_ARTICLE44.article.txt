## HABLES, PARSONS DUEL IN SPRINTS MAY UPHOLD CARD, TROJAN SPEED TRADITIONS 
### Feg Murray, '16 
When Les Hables and Charley
Parsons take their marks tomorrow
t afternoon, track fans will see an
! other pair of fast sprints that have
characterized Indian - Trojan meets
for more than two decades.
Dating back to 1920 when S.C.'s
Charley Paddock started his series
of wins from Morris Kirksey, Card
star, both schools have been con
sistently strong in the dashes re
gardless of the remaining events.
Fast Time
!
;! In the 100 both men ran under
10 flat and in the longer dash 21.4
wasn't si>: unusual. Kirksey pushed
Paddock to -equal -his--world record
maj'k of 9.6 in the centuty when
they>met in 1921. The Stanford star
lecf at the 85-yard mark but a final
i spurt gave the rate to Paddock.
In 1927 Charlie Borah took the
track for the Trojan Horde and

' proved too much for three years of
Stanford runners. Hec Dyer was his i
best competition.
Starting the season as just an
other sprinter, Dyer came through
as a winner in 1!(.'}0 when he took
a !).(> century from Frank WykolV.
In the 220 the Card dash man
came from behind to got a dead
heat finish decision—time 21.4.
The next year WykofT proved too
| strong in the short dash but gave
way in the longer. Dyer won the
220 by a foot after trailing until 50
yards from the tape. Last year with
.Hables on the sick list, Wykoff had
both sprints decidedly to himself.
Students at Michigan State Col
lege are allowed to cut classes from
