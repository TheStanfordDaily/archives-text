# VARSITY AND FRESHMAN VETERANS RETURN FOR '33 SOCCER PRACTICE
## 
### 
Bright lights are beginning to
shine on the already bright soccer
horizon. Spring practice is bringing
back into early-season form the
veterans of last year's varsity and
freshman teams, and bringing to
prominence other luminous players.
Louis Bansbaeh, freshman, has
been playing a good left-half, while
two other freshman veterans, Don
Hanson and Miguel Gomez, are lead

crs on the forward lino. For full
back, Henry Valentine is on his
toes and doing a promising share of
treading on the toes of others.
Of the varsity men, Dick St rouse
and Rod Lewis have been put at
fullback, Doug Kennedy, Johnny
Hitchcock, Dave Dunning, Rudy
Gonzales, Ed Murphy, and others
put plenty of strength in the half
back wall.
