# Water Polo Team Faces Adverse Odds
## STANFORD CHAMPS BATTLE L.A.A.C.'S OLYMPIANS TODAY 
### Willard Bungay 
Vlad Taranik, star water polo
guard, wii.s sent to the Men's Rest
Home with a severe cold yesterday
on the eve of the most important
game of the season. The Indians
tangle with the mighty Los Angeles
Athletic Club team at !hls o'clock
this afternoon in the first contest of
a two-out-of-three-game series, the
proceeds of which will be given to
the Convalescent Home. A charge of
25c per game will be made.
It was not known whether Tara
nik will he able to play today,
Init lie may he able to get into
tomorrow's contest, which will
immediately precede the track
meet at I o'clock. ll' a third game
is necessary, it will be played at
4:15 o'clock.
The L.A.A.C. team, which repre
sented the United States in the
Olympic Games last year, is the
strongest septet ever to represent
this country in Olympic mompeti
tion. They decisively defeated the
Illinois A.C., National Indoor cham
pions, Brazil, and Japan; tied Ger
many, and were beaten by Hungary,
the Olympic champions.
Naturally Stanford will be on the
short end of the odds against this
great aggregation of tank stars, in
eluding Phil and Earl Daubenspek
(with Rich Daubenspek in reserve),
Dutch McAllister, Wally O'Connor,
and Ilerbio Wildman.
Indians Take Titles
However, the Indians had little
difficulty in winning the Northern
California Water Polo League title,
with two victories each over the
Olympic Club, Athens Club, and
University of California. Stanford
also took the Pacific Coast Intercol
legiate title from U.S.C., U.C.L.A.,
and California. If Taranik is in
shape to plav, Indians may be able
to give the clubmen a strong argu
ment.
Today's game will be featured by
