# STANFORD-CALIFORNIA POLO TEAMS MEET TOMORROW
## 
### CHARLES CHAPPELL 
With most other Stanford-Califor
nia sports contests for the present
year already completed, polo teams
of the two universities will settle
the matter of mallet-wielding su
premacy tomorrow afternoon when
they clash on Fairmont Field in
North Berkeley in the first polo
game ever to be played between the
Indians and the Bears.
Bear Mystery Team
Inexperienced, but anxious to
stimulate interest in polo at Berke
ley, the newly organized Bear quar-
I tet has played several practice
games, winning them all. Just what
sort of opposition California has met
is not known. The Stanford four
will find themselves in the position
of meeting a mysterious aggregation
that may or may not pull a surprise.
The California quartet has been

organized and coached by H. S.
Pearson, a former British army offi
cer, who is rated at three goals. To
insure a more closely contested
game. Pearson will be allowed to
play with his team. He will hold
down the number three position. The
rest of the Bear lineup will include
Nat Haskett at number one, Bill
Marshall at two, and Jack Hays at
back.
Captain Gordan will start the
same Redshirt lineup that succeeded
in holding Arizona to a 4 to 4 tie
last Friday. It includes Luppe Lup
pen at number one, Woody Melone
at two, Captain Pete Gillham at
three, and Johnny Myers at back.
Pat Robb and Kemp Maer, who
played several chukkers of the sec
ond Arizona game, will probably be
' used also.
