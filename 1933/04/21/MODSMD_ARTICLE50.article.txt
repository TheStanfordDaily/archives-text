# 'WATCH NIMMO,' IS CRY AS '36 MILER NEARS 1914 RECORD
## 
### 
I "Four-twenty three-five." It may
sound like a jumble, but it means
that Stanford has not yet ceased
producing world-beaters on the cin
derpath. For that means that little
Chuck Nimmo, frosh phenomenon,
is a mere three and a half seconds
from the Big Meet and Stanford
records set by Wilson in the mile
in 1914.
He has yet to run his best race.
â€¢ He has yet to meet first-class com
petition. He hu.s yet to feel the
worth of Dink's wizard-like track
coaching.
Three years ago it was "Watch
Blazing Ben"; now the cry should
be "Watch Nanistic Nimmo."
