TIIE TEMPEST (Sturmeder Leiden
schaft). Recently at the Varsity
Theatre.
Ernil Jannings in the German film
"The Tempest" makes fine comedy
with extravagant melodrama. His
pantomime technique carried over
from silent pictures is convincingly
used iis the comedy crook who
swindled the prisoners out of their
cigarettes and blew up those banks
left after the depression.
Hut when his friend told him that
Annya, his mistress, was unfaithful,
he lost his sense of humor, chased
the offender through a shower of
carnival fireworks, up into a tower
overlooking a lake, and knocked
him through the wall into the water.
The offender couldn't swim. The
second time his Annya cheated he
took Ihe second party and used a
knife on him in the alley. Then Jan

ning.s decided that he couldn't kill
them nil and went back to jail.
Annya w;us played by Anna Sten,
who said "Yes" in German like
Greta Garbo and walked like Mar-
It ne Dietrich. Once she got her
arms around a man her acting was
entirely convincing and directly to
ihe point. But her melodramatic
scenes were too wide-eyed.
Franz Nicklisch, the bad boy from
the reform school who betrayed his
friend Junnings, gave an ox-like
performance. He spoke about three
times during the picture. The pho
tography was poor; Miss Sten's
beautiful face was often exposed to
the glare of direct light without any
.softening shadow effects. The
scenes were shot at such an angle
that all perspective was lost. The
show soinwhat resembled an ani
mated post card. â€”Stanford
