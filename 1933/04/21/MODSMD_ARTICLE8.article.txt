# Track Record Of S.C. Coach
## 
### Frank Tremaine 
Leading his Trojan warriors in
another invasion against the Indian
horde, Dean Cromwell, dean of Pa- !
cific Coast track coaches, makes his :
biennial appearance on the Farm to- j
morrow with another galaxy of stars j
and future stars.
Oldest mentor in point of service ;
on the coast, the U.S.C. coach first j
appeared on this earth at Turner,
Oregon, some 54 years ago and has |
spent the majority of those years in j
athletics of some sort or other. For \
the last 24 years he has been devel
oping champions at Southern Cali
fornia.
Was Football Star
Cromwell received his college ed
ucation at Occidental, where he
made a name for himself in foot
hall as well as in track. In fact, he
was such a valuable man on the
gridiron that he captained the Oxy
team for four years. His connection
with football was also carried to j
U.S.C. where he coached the then 1
not-so-Thundering Herd in 1909, j
1910, 1917, and 1918.
As a trackman, he was one of Oc
cidental's most versatile stars, com
peting in the 50-, 100-, and 440-yard
dashes, pole vault., hammer throw,
shot put., and it is said that he could
even show the modern co-ed .some
thing for he was one of the school's
leading bicycle racers.
Enviable Record
At the Trojan institution, Crom
well has compiled an enviable rec
ord, rivaled only by Stanford's Dink
Templeton. In nine yeajs of com
petition, U.S.C. has won the 1.C.4-A
championship five times. Inciden
tally, Stanford won three of the
other four years, one Eastern school
breaking into the win column since
1924. Troy also won three of the
four N.C.A.A. championships it has
competed for.
Despite his enviable record as a
coach of championship teams, it is
as a developer of individual stars


Dean Cromwell, U.S.C. mentor,
who leads liis squad here tomorrow
seeking another Trojan victory.
Cromwell lias kept his charges well
covered all season, and is expected
to jerk things wide open with the
usual S.C. "come through" magic

; gest mark. No less than eight past
I or present world's record holders re

Kelly First Star
His first great star was "King"
| Kelly who set a world's mark in the
, high hurdles of 15 seconds flat 'way
back in 1911!, and the following year
the great negro, Howard Drew, the
first of Cromwell's famous sprinters,
flashed down the track to tic the
world's records in the 100- and 220-
i yard dashes.
Following these two came the first
"world's fastest human," Charley
| Paddock; Bud Houser, record hold
i er in the discus; Lee Barnes, record
