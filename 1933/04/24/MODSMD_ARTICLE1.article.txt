# Victories Of Indian Jumpers Prove Too Much For Trojans
## Schween Sets Pace for Come-Through Performances While Williams, Zaches Follow Suit; Mottram Brilliant in Javelin 
### DICK STROUSE 
MIGHTY host of 1 !>.'{.*> Thors from Stanford, by defeating Southern
California, 07 to 04, in an immortal track meet, proved the superiority
of mind over matter and of patient Indian long-suffering over Trojan

omniscience bere Saturday afternoon
sistent, tiiat rumor of LI.S.CVs exisbei
of Stanford, but the ultimate tri-<
unip.s of science establishes S.C. as
nothing but a subsidiary of Pomona
or U.C.L.A.
It was Lloyd Schween who was
most instrumental in instigating the
present search for the Lost School.
Schween, who was condescendingly
donated one point in the high-jump
by San Francisco sports experts and
who was superciliously donated no
points by the Los Angeles sports
experts, jumped (i feet, 4% inches
to cause the crowd first to gasp, then
to cheer, and finally haughtily to
question, "Who are MacNaughton
and Van Osdel?"
Another Theory in Discard
Two family men met in the
sprints, and Charley Parsons of S.C.
found the ghost of his father less
potent than Les Ilables' own kith
and kin and winged heels. Hables,
(he Mercury among Thors, won the
dashes against a wind in 9.7 and 21.6,
and he did it by overcoming Les
Ball's fast start in the 100 and by
resisting Parsons' challenge in the
220 to conquer going away.
Lyons and Paul? Hub!
The hurdles found Cotto Herbert,
an industrious plodder till Satur- j
day, outracing Captain Jcddy Welch
of S.C. for a third in the highs and
outracing Norman Paul, the Trojan,
for a brilliant 23.7 win in the lows. I
And the hurdles also found Gus
Meier, with one of his crowd-raising
Meier finishes, beat Bob Lyon to |
the tape in the highs and take a I
gratifying and useful third in the 1
lows.
Johnny Mottram, like Schween a j
sophomore who competes to win and j
who fits into any god-like track
team since Greek gods are chronicled
as tremendous javelin-throwers, al
most reached the 210-foot marker
on an early toss, which unbelievable
behavior caused Trojan MeKcnzie
to blink his eyes and philosophize
upon the futility of it all as his own
come-through heave was good only
for a second.
And Here Laborde and Gordon
Dunn led the Stanford weight team
to its expected and necessary 17
points, Here shimmering the dis
cus 1(52 feet and Slinger the shot 51
feet 10 inches.
Can Graduate in Peace
In the distances, little Phil Moren
tin chopped his way to a second in
the mile and tough Art Azevedo
finished a strong second in the two
mile when Morentin found two long
races in one day too much for him.
A1 Blackman, unable to meet the
winning sprints for Ablowich and
Tompkins in the 440, passed Cotton
Warburton for a third.
Two men might have done better
had it been necessary. Bill Miller,
hurt foot and all, was ready to try
14 feet in the pole vault until he
learned that (he meet was already
won. Les Hables was ready to win
the relay for Stanford until similar
information was relayed to him.
But, above all, there was that
thunderous appeal that made pos
sible the graduation of a Stanford
generation that had seen an import
ant Stanford athletic victory over S.C.

. For years, unsubstantiated but in
ce has burdened the despondent soul
