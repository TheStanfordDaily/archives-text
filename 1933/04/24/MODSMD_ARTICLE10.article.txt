# Paly To Vote On Beer Law
## 
### 
Whether or not beer will flow in
Palo Alto will in all probability be
put to a vote of Palo Alto's citizens
in a proposed election to modify the
city charter's dry rulings, City At
torney Arnold Rum well declared
last night.
An initiative petition seeking to
amend the city charter to prohibit
the sale of "intoxicating" instead of
"alcoholic liquors" is being circu
lated. Local beer enthusiasts are en
trenched in Ihe position that by
congressional definition the new 3.2
brew is not an "intoxicating liquor."
The present aim is to get 600 sig
natures on the petition before its
presentation to the city council fol
lowing the trial in Judge R. R. Syer's
court growing out of habeas corpus
proceedings in the arrest of Harry
Brady charged with selling 3.2 beer
in violation of local city ordinances.
Three hundred names arc already
obtained.
The council is asked to submit
the proposed amendments to the
people in an election to be held
within GO days from the filing of the
paper.
Rumwell noted that should Brady
be found not guilty of violation of
the city ordinance against alcoholic
beverages by the sale of 3.2 beer, an
election to change the charter would
be unnecessary.
Rumwell expressed the opinion
that there is little likelihood of this
occurring, however, and that final
settlement of the question will prob
ably be by a popular referendum.
