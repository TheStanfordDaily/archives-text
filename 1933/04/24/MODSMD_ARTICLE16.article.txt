# 'Hawk Island' Acclaimed Ingenious Murder Drama
## 
### GEOFFREY NORTH 
7 (Editor's Note: The writer, who
witnessed the "Hawk Island" pre
miere in London in 1929, has kindly
consented to write this review for
the Daily.)
Because its development is in
genious and its action well-handled,
"Hawk Island" wins a place among
the .stage's more interesting murder
melodramas.
The plot profits by the element of
surprise, which is doubly effective
because I lie interest continues even
through the last act which, though
usually given over to explaining and
winding up odds and ends, in the
case of "Hawk Island" is the most
gripping of Ihe three.
The scene is a lonely island, sum
mer quarters of a wealthy bachelor
who has gathered about him, as

' week-end visitors, a group Â«>f rest- j
less young married people. Flirta- !
tions and a discussion of murder j
mysteries hold (lie attention of the
guests until the real action of the j
piece begins, and from then on, the j
( play is carried forward with amaz
ing skill.
The London production, at the :
Comedy Theatre, was enhanced by \
a capable east and one which played i
the Young play for comedy as well
as drama, augmenting its effective- j
ness.
It would appear to me a play
singularly well adapted to perform- :
ance at the hands of a well-trained \
college cast, and a play which '
should prove a noteworthy popular
and artistic success.
