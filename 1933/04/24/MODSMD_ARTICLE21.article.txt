They said il couldn't be done, unless every man on Ihej
leani came through with a performance 'way over his head.

meet. Kven the relay, usually an Indian stronghold, looked 1
doubtful.
But what happened Saturday afternoon, not even the
Los Angeles sports writers can explain. Those Stanfords
just naturally "came through," that's all, and walked away
with the meet. However, 11 icy comfort themselves by think

In attempting to find some cause for the victory, they |
seem to overlook a very potent reason in the person of
this young Tcmpleton fellow. There is certainly no track i
coach in the country who, set back at least 18 points bv
injuries to three stars, could yet bring his team through to
win over a squad as strong in every event as this year's 1

liams, and all the rest.
Sickness or no sickness, team injuries or no team in
juries, Dink is on top again, and the Farm hails both team
and coach.
