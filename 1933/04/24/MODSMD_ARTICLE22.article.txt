# And a Kiss for Cinderellaâ€” Masque Ball Tradition Due to Endure
## 
### 
On a rosy Monday morning like this one, when bou
quets are being thrown freely and back-slaps are being
tossed profusely at sweat-shirled shoulders, a hard-work- j
ing Rally Committee should not be forgotten. In a way, 1
the sponsors of the Masque Hall came through just as sen
sationally as did the gentlemen of the spiked shoes on the {
following Saturday afternoon. The Rally Committee threw i
a dance which will be remembered long after the last tan-'
gled strands of serpentine have rotted awav beneath the
Pavilion eaves.
The committee had a job on its hands this year, all
l ight. The Masque Halls of future years were on trial Fri-|
day night, just as was W. 2 per cent beer, in a sense. A year
ago, during strict Prohibition, the Hall was a brawl. A
repetition of last year's disgusting spectacle on Friday
night would have meant the end of the Masque Hall for
esee. Hut Stanford men, with a warm afternoon in Menlo
beer gardens behind them, came to the dance sober, and
everybody seemed to have a good time, even the patrons.
That fact ought to prove something or other, but it prob- 1
ably won't.
II was an evening of surprises, pleasant ones. The Pa
vilion looked nice, the music was good, the costumes were
shall we say ? chosen and worn in good taste, the coro
nation ceremony went off smoothly. Most surprising of all,
the fun was so unrestrained, yet so utterly harmless, that
there's sure to be a Masque Hall next Spring.
