Last year, during the* presidential campaign, the earn
])iis was a rather unwilling host to swarms of tourists who
ran their ears up on the sidewalks to ask students: "Hi
there, huh, can ye tell us where 'bouts is the Hoover
home?"
Now that the defeated candidate has taken up 11 is resi
dence on the campus again, the tourists are coming anew.
Yesterday afternoon, a car-load was directed, probably
by mistake, up to a large while fraternity house on Lasuen.
Arriving there, the tourists parked on the opposite side of
ihe street and settled down to wait for a glimpse of Squire
I loover.
Out on Ihe lawn Ihcy saw a couple of young fellows
playing catch. "Probably his sons," they opined.
When four or five more young fellows joined the ball
game, they decided: "(iuess he's giving" a party to the
young people of the campus. Heal democratic, isn't it?"
Thev were startled somewhat when a face covered with
shaving-lather leaned out of an upper window and shout
ed: "Pipe down, you punks!" And further startled when
they discovered three bare backs on a sun-porch.
Hut the tip-oil for the tourists came when a head was
thrust out of the door and a voice yelled: "Hey, that load
of b—r just showed up! Come and get it!"
