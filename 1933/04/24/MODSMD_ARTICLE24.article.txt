# BULL SESSION
## IT CAN BE DONE; WE DID IT 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
The Masque Ball is historically a
symbol for the release of all re
straint—which as far as the Admin
istration is concerned means the
i breaking of the alcoholic flood
gates—and the pouring out upon
the Pavilion floor of the season's
greatest display of drunks and near
drunks. Friday night was an out
j standing exception. That was most
fortunate.
The gossipers had it that should
Friday's dance have developed into
the customary staggering horde, the
Masque Ball would have joined the
Hi-J inks and the Bonfire in most
certain oblivion. The self-restraint
of 1933 has saved the Ball for an
other year. Its existence, I suppose,
must always be precarious, depend
ing ever on the sobriety of the pre
ceding year.
Why costumes should customarily
stimulate the alcoholic palate has
never been quite clear to me. Nu
merous theories have been ad
vanced. None explain the pheno
mena. The orthodox hypothesis is
that people will do things when
their identity is unknown which
they will never do ordinarily. Pass
ing the question of veracity in the !
statement, it is obvious that it
doesn't hold for the Masque Ball in '
the least.
First of all, collegians have no
fear of being seen in an intoxicated !
condition. They would rather be 1
SEEN drunk. I have yet to find
more than a handful who slink off I

|to imbibe in privacy. Secondly,
everyone's identity is well known
after the Ball has been in progress
115 minutes. No one can endure the
tickling irritation of a mask longer
than that. Those that can are in
museums and sideshows. Their time
is too valuable to attend a Masque
Ball.
Another proposed explanation is
that people feel very foolish in cos
tumes and use alcohol (in some
form other than mouth-wash) to
! compensate for the innate sense of
idiocy that costumes are said to
create. This has weight when we
realize that people would practically
rather be burned at the stake than
appear foolish. But while I often
1 have felt "silly" in costumes, the re
action is usually one of being proud
in the expertness of our own silliness
and never any inward sense of in
feriority. No, this "psychological"
explanation must be discarded.
There is still another possible
theory that can explain the rush of
alcohol at a Masque Ball. When we
take off our customary clothes, we
remove all the customary restraints
that attach to them. Personally, I al
ways feel fully liberated in a
1 shower. Not only do my limbs move
| freely, but I develop all sorts of new
ideas that would never occur to me
in street clothes. Clothes not only
make the man, but Ball clothes re- |
make him.
Be these reasons as they may, the j
Masque Ball was sober, and that is '
! what counts.
