GOD'S LITTLE ACRE—By Erskine ]
Caldwell. The Viking Press. 19M.
(At the Gordon Strawbridge Li
brary, in the Cellar.)
! An unimpressive excrement of the
) post-Hemingway school is Mr. Cald
-1 well's book. It is a naked, hard,
•I brittle book, dealing with brutal
! emotions that never suceed in being
! either brutal or emotional, and with
j individual characters who never
succeed in being human personali
j ties.
The author has been content
, rather to make his picture of the
! decayed South a collection of sex
• episodes (to which the remainder of
the dramatis personae, if not en
gaged themselves, apt as audience)
interspersd with lengthy and dull
conversations. This method of pre
sentation is unsuccessful, because
the dialogue is not sharply defined
! to characterize the speakers, nor is
there a strong situation already es
! tablished to which they can relate
! significantly.
Although laden with sex and set
in a Georgia locale, the book is re
j moved from Faulknerian categories
j by its comic tone. Lust here is cal
lous but bitterly jocular. The at
mosphere, however, is not sustained
I by the characters, who are merely
! the germs of the convincing por
trayals they might have been, and [
i whose actions occur without appar
(ent purpose or result. Only in the
figure of Pluto has Mr. Caldwell ap
proached success in the use of his
potentially colorful material.
Caldwell may write a good book
when he overcomes his interest in
sexual vaudeville, finds a less muddy
and adolescent approach to writing,
and learns to rewrite his manu
j scripts a number of times. His short
stories are often excellent and far
I above "God's Little Acre," a very
| tiny acre indeed, which no one, cer
tainly not God, need bother very
much about. —Broughton
THE METHOD AND EFFECT OF
CAVALCADE—(Current at the
Stanford Theatre).
Cavalcade is an extraordinary dif
ficult film to evaluate; its emotional
effect seems out of proportion to the
methods by which it is obtained; it
! casually defies the rule of dramatic
building and is, in construction,
i more an epic than a drama; it builds
episodically through a split series of
melodramatic scenes; but it is un
deniably an extraordinarily poig

nant and powerful film.
Possibly its power rests in the
fact that the trickery is merely a
means of expression (by a man
whose chief writing has been in the
field of high comedy) and that be
yond its trickery, and beneath it,
the mood of the author is as clear
as it is justified.
Coward has based his play upon
the tragic trend of the twentieth
century, a mad, oblivious dance to
ward destruction. His attitude is de
spairing but not cynical; there is a
spendid gallantry about the toast
in the final scene: the Marryots, pos
sessing all that they can desire ma
terially, but shorn of their dearest
associates, living in a chaos, cling
peacefully to the memories which
the first decades of the twentieth
century have brought them, and
look back with a quiet, almost
amused acceptance, drinking to
England in the hope that she "may
some day find greatness and dignity
and peace again."
The bewildered despair of Cow
ard's attitude as he views the crazy
pace of the century, justified as it
is, seems to be the reason why this
film is a fine one. But the shallow,
if infernally clever method of ex
pression which Coward has used (I
refer in particular to the scene of the
Titanic, and that of the army an- |
nouncement of Mafeking's relief) i
will probably prevent any very ex
tended force of his observations. It
is easily conceivable that another >
generation may consider it no more j
than a cheap patriotic melodrama, :
written from a unique point of view
by a young fellow whose handling of \
his pen was as amazingly facile as I
it was undignified.
At present, however, it does re
main, by virtue of its sincerity and
intensity, and despite some techni
cal distractions (which, for me at ;
least, disappeared with a second i
visit to the film), a production to I
be x'ecommended in the 1 highest j
terms.
Lack of space prevents comment j
upon the elaborate production, the !
faithful attention to detail, the quiet J
playing of the fine cast which lends
a universality to their expression, !
and a hundred other important fac
tors in the film's success.
