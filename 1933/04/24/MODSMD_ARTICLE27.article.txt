EPITAPH
Poor Oscar here doth now remain
He led a life quite full—
Until he ran to catch a train
An<l pushed a door marked "Pull."

ENTER THi: VILLAIN
(From the Ripon. Calif., Record)
Separated from his wife through
one of the minor hazards of hitch
i hiking, Al Simlin, 32, of Chicago, has
appealed to The Chronicle, police,
travel agencies, and motorists to help
him find her.
He lost her somewhere between
Kingman and Topoc, Arizona, while
hitch-hiking to California from Chi
cago. And it was all on account of
a guy with a dinky little coupe with
room for one.
