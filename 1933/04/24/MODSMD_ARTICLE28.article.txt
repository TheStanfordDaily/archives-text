"The Critic; or, a Tragedy Re- j
hearsed," Richard Brinsley Sheri- !
dan's highly amusing thrust at the j
ridiculous grandiloquence of "heroic j
tragedy," at playwrights, and of!
press-agents masquerading as au- i
ihorities on the drama, has been se- I
j lected as the second of four read
-1 ings to be sponsored during the
quarter by Sword and Sandals.
Because the second and third acts I
of the play take place during the
rehearsal of a ludicrous tragedy, and
because mere reading can hardly do :
justice to Sheridan's stage direc-1
tions, it has been found necessary j
to include a considerable part of the ,
action. The reading will consequent- !
ly be not only the most elaborate, I
but the most difficult that the or- 1
ganization has presented thus far.
Large Cast
The cast is unusually large. There j
arc some twenty roles, most of them j
a set of annoyed actors in the trag- !
edy within the play. The range of J
characterization is wide and offers 1
fine comic possibilities.
General tryouts will be held'this j
afternoon at 1:30 o'clock in the Lit- 1
tie Theatna, Because of the size of
the cast, it is desirable that there j
should be a considerable number of!
tryoutees. Students desiring to try j
i out should, if possible, obtain copies j
of the comedy.
I'lay Short
The play is a short one and will j
need no cutting. The parts include j
about seven for women: Mrs. Dan- !
gle, wife of a "lover of the drama," j
and five bored ladies of the theatri- |
cal troupe. There are two excited
Italian ladies and one confused '
French interpreter included in the
I first act.
The reading is to be prsented on ;
May 4; a fairly intensive schedule :
of rehearsal is anticipated in view
of the necessity for blocking out
action.
