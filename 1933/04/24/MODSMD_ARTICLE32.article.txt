## Dopester Durkee Saunters Jauntily Away 
### 
A tall, straight, dapper man in
striped flannels, a double-breasted
tan coat, a soft silk tie, ice cream
shoes, and a jaunty straw lid drop
ped into Our Place late Saturday
night. He grabbed my right hand
and shook it; he grabbed my left
hand and shook it; he grabbed me
and shook me.
"I told you so," he chorteled
joyously in a piercing, raucous
voice, sweeping the mantle clear of
debris and parking the bedecked
chapeau thereon, "I said they
could do it. Oh. sweetheart, would
I like to be in Southern California
right now. Boys, did you see Gus
Meier thumb his nose (figurative
ly, of course) at Max Stiles as he
passed Lyon in those last 15 yards;
did you see how pitiful the Tro
jan discus-throwers looked; did
you see . . .
"Just a minute," I insisted in my
quiet, subdued way. "Before break
ing into my sanctum and up
roariously bedecking (he walls with
the echo of your noxious blather
ing, kindly inform me as to your
identity, reasons for presence, and
intenl ions."
A SKCONI) LOOK—AND
IT'S DOPESTER
Then I looked again at the pranc
ing gentleman as ho bravely swung
liis cane and strutted into the kitch
en toward the ice-box. I looked
closely, and by the great god Bac
chus, it was Dopester Durkee, free
of gold dust and with a pocket full
of 25-eent Havanas of his own.
As I introduced the old hill-billy
to the gay crowd that htronged
our festive hoard, he shouted at
us all, "And what would have hap
pened had Eastman and Miilcr and
D« aeon and Amdahl and Gray and
Don Blackmail all been in shape?"
Infused with all the buoyant
spirit of the unquenchable old man,
I answered. "Why, speaking conser
vatively and giving S.C. the relay
that Hahles and Eastman and the
Blackmans would have won, Cap
tain Ben would have meant nine
more points; Miller and Deacon, two
or three; Amdahl would have added
three; and Nellie would have meant
one more."
"And what," queried the old
lout, "do (!7 and 15 total? Eighty
two points, or I never dunked al
gebra. Eighty-two points without
injuries and <i 7 with them. Broth
ers, ii's one swell night," and Old
Dopester brandished an empty
beer bottle in one hand and a full
one in the other—both, of course,
the containers of legal liquid, Mr.
Culver.
THE CROWD: THE WHOLE
( KOWD: NOTHING BUT
THE CROWD
Bill, who had been listening to
this wild outburst, not because he
is by nature a listening man but
because there is nothing else to do
when Dopester begins to rant,
chirped in:
"It was the crowd that got me,
by gosh. The crowd that rose and
tried to help Al Blackmail pass
Ablowich as they came off the
turn: the crowd that tore its hair
in delightful frenzy as Les Ilables
withstood Parsons' ominous chal
lenge in the 220 (I am sure that
Ui 11 said 'ominous' for he is tak
ing English 2a): the crowd that
acted like imbecilic apes as
Schwecn jumped six-four and
three-eighths and that then
cheered most rudely as McNaugh
ton missed the same height."
"Sure," 1 continued for Bill, "the
part of the crowd named Bruce
Tarver that was torn between his
own repeated statements concern
ing the wonderful Norman Paul (of
Santa Ana) and his loyalty to Stan
ford as Cotto Herbert ran Paul into
the ground in the lows; the crowd
that failed to realize that Dave
Brown's 190 feet, 7 inches and
Gray's 49 feet, 7 inches couudn't
place in a dual meet; the crowd that
watched Phil Williams just float up
to the broad-jump take-off board
and then land nearly 24 feet away."
"THERE'S NOTHING TOO GOOD
I OK THOSE LADS"
Grace, who had entered unobtru
sively with Durkee, then said:
"My, how sunburned those S.C.
boys looked in their red jerseys, and
how white the Stanford boys look.
Oh dear, but I DO like sun-tanned
people, even if they are from the
South. I think that you are just too
mean for words to make fun of the
Trojans like that."
But just then, old Durkee came
hack in time to rescue Grace and
whisper confidentially to us that
she was from lowa. The ancient
buckaroo cocked the straw lid on
one side of his head, donned a
gorgeous herring-bone light-coat,
and helped Grace into her wrap.
Then he shouted, still joyous:
"Gosh, Dick, I have to go. Bui by
the great God Morpheus who won't
meet me tonight, I wish I had a
sister. Then I could introduce her
to Lloyd Schween; there's nothing
too nood for thai Buy."
