# L.A.A.C. Beats Cards For Water Polo Crown
## MERCURIES SWEEP SERIES WITH WIN IN OVERTIME TILT 
### Willard Bungay 
Carrying the national champion
to two extra periods and then only
losing when the timer's gun beat the
tieing score by a mere tenth of a
secotul, Stanford's great water polo
team came through with a perform
ance Saturday that was rivaled in
.skill and successful battling against
impossible odds only by the bril
liant showing of the tracksters later
the same afternoon.
Easily superior in the first game,
the L.A.A.C. team found itself pit
ted against a rejuvenated, hard
fighting, fast-swimming outfit Sat
urday that had ceased to be over
awed and matched score for score.
Triolo's Goal Too Late
After the count was tied 3 to 3
at the end of the game and 4 to 4
after the first extra periods, Ted
Wiget, star Indian forward, got over
zealous guarding Phil Daubenspek
and was thrown out of the pool.
Captain Burke Knapp decided to let

! the clubmen score immediately in
i order to get Wiget back in the
I game, but the tiring Mercurians
| withstood the Stanford attack for
| the final three minutes and were
! saved from a third tie when the
timekeeper (who was a Stanford
man) declared that Jimmy Triolo's
goal was made after the game had
I ended.
Captain Knapp was the out
| standing man in the pool. Playing
inspiring polo, time after time he
made "impossible stops" to save
j Stanford from defeat. Knapp's
j playing surpassed that of Herbie
Wildman, who has been called
j "the greatest goal guard in the
world," but he had more chances
j than the Club star.
Phil Daubenspek, as expected, was
' the sparkplug of the national cham
! pions. Making five goals in the first
j game, and two in the second, this
| great tank star was a constant
j threat. However, Ted Wiget was
! moved to centerback to guard him
â–  in the second game and he rather
! effectually smothered Daubenspek.
Team Does Year's Best
It is hard to pick out individual
i Indian stars as they all played their
best game of the year and were
I much greater in defeat than they
j have ever been in victory. Perhaps
| special mention should be made of
Vlad Taranik who got out of a sick
bed to play and tied with Phil and
I Earl Daubenspeck Saturday for high
point honors. However, Graves,
Wiget, Hirsch, Kinkead, Triolo, and
! Benet were all just as great and
deserve plenty of praise.
