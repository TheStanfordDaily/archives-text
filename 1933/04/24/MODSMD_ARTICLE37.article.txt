With 28 campus organizations
competing for the University titles
in intramural hard and soft base

ball, five first-round games are
scheduled for this afternoon. Hard
ball games will be held on the var
sity and frosh ball diamonds and
soft ball games will take place on
the frosh and Grey gridirons.
Several teams have been practic
ing for the past week in preparation
for the coming games and close
competition is expected as the re
sults of these contests may deter
mine which organization wins the
intramural trophy this year. This is
the last major sport of the intra
mural program.
At the present time El Toro is in
the lead for the title, followed
closely by Breakers and Phi Kappa
Sigma. The Phi Kaps, winners of
last year's hard ball title, are hoping
to annex this season's championship
in order to overcome Toro's advan
tage.
Beta Theta Pi will defend its soft
ball championship against a strong
field of competitors. More interest
has been shown in this division than
the hard ball league probably owing
to the fact that less equipment is
needed.
