## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, April 23 (/Pi—
Validity of claims of three "widows"
upon the $9,000,000 posthumous es
tate of Washington H. Ochsner,
Stanford University geologist, will
be determined by a jury, Superior
Judge Frank H. Dunne has ruled.
The jury trial had been requested
by Mrs. Hilda Calling Ochsner, the
geologist's third mate and his wife
when he died in 1927 a poor man—
before discovery of oil in Kettleman
Hills gave his 2500-acre holdings
their immense value.
