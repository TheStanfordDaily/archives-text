# CARDS STAKE SOLE HOPE ON HAWLEY IN TOURNEY
## 
### JAY GRAVES 
Stanford's hopes for the Northern
amateur golf championship grew
dimmer today as only one Cardinal
golfer remained to enter the quar
ter finals out of the 14 who left tho
Farm last week to play qualifying
rounds.
Stew Hawley beat his fellow
Stanfordite, Gene Brown, yesterday
afternoon, and was uie only one who
kept the Cards on the score sheet.
Little Drops Match
Lawson Little, of whom much was
expected, was beaten 3 up and 2 to
play by Jim Ritchie of Stockton.
Little's game did not crack. He shot
two over par golf, but Ritchie went
him one better and made it one over
par.
The boy from Stockton is a former
champion in this tournament, and
has had about 12 years of competi
tive experience.
Ritchie also beat Jack Hoerner in
the morning round yesterday. Bill
Dwyer lost 2 up to Bramdall, and
Don Edwards, enthusiastic frosh,
was beaten 1 up by Griswald.
Twiggs Optimistic
The twenty-eighth annual ama
teur tourney, sponsored by the
Northern California Golf Associa
tion, is being held at the California
Golf Club iii San Francisco.
a
Quarter final rounds will be held
April 29, and Hawley will be the
only Stanfordite participating. Eddie

' Twiggs, golf coach, gives him a
chance to come through and place
higher on the ladder. His qualifying
round was a 75â€”only three over par.
