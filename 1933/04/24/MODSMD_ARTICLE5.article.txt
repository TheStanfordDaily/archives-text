kiddies are richer by approximately
$325 or more, according to figures
available last night, as a result of
profits from the Rally Committee's
annual Masque Ball.
With over 300 couples in attend
ance, Queen Cubbison and King
Nyeland were crowned with all the
pomp and ceremony of Louis XIV
as the gay throngs clad in outlandish
and original costumes stood by to
watch. Eph Engleman's syncopated
ceremonies featured group work by
the entire court, which was com
posed of all the Pi Phi pledges in
fancy dress.
The Royal Cardinals' ten-piece
orchestra and vocal trio and a com
plete amplifying system provided
excellent music and intermission en
tertainment.
Costumes were so diversified and
attractive, that crtics found it hard
to pick any as outstanding. Decora
tions were by Gilman Gist and
Jimmy Algar and included a rain
bow effect in back of the huge
throne platform and several masks
of comedy and tragedy.
