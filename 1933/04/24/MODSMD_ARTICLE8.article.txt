# 'IC4A!' Whoops Dink And Team; Cromwell Mourns
## 
### SPUD HAMILTON 
A hilarious crowd thronged out of
Stanford Stadium Saturday, joyful
because the Cardinal had at last
broken into the Trojan ring of vic
lory which had come near estab
lishing itself as a tradition.
"Now for the 1.C.4-A.'' was the
keynote. "And hot diggity, arc those
boys Schween and Williams and
Zachcs the fair-haired tots."
"Quote me anyway you want,"
said Dink Ttmpleton. "Sure we'll be
there with bells on for the 1.C.4-A.Y'
"I never was optimistic about this
meet," gloomed the veteran Dean
Cromwell as he consoled the discon
solate Trojans in their dressing
room. "I think the winning cycle for

S.C. is temporarily broken, but we'll
be back up here in a few years."
Th Stanford squad from "Papa
Hard-Luck Abe Lucky Les" Hablcs
through men-of-the-hour Mottram,
Williams, Zaches, and Schween down
the list to Jim Ferric, victim of a
complicated stratcgcm that didn't
work, the Stanford squad was of
one mindâ€”beat S.C. again May (J
and then go after the intercollegiate
title.
"And they can get it," Dink op
timized. "All these "come-through"
boys should keep on coming through.
So Cromwell thinks U.S.C. is
through, eh? Well, he always was
a great hand to kid us along."
