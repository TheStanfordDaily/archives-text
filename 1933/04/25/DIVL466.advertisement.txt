Did you every stop to think why business
firms advertise in the STANFORD DAILY?
Do they advertise in order to help the paper

No, they advertise in the DAILY because
they have a definite message for you—you and
some four thousand other DAILY readers.
They have unusual values in quality merchan
dise which they believe will win your approval.
They use this means to tell you of these values.

styles; the newest products; and the most rea
sonable prices. "You can rely on it if it's ad
vertised."
