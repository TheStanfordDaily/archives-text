### B. Kellogg 
At approximately the time Ameri
can brewers began to worry about
a phophesied beer shortage, Great
Britain's allied industries decided
to do something about the beer they
had but couldn't sell.
According to a letter recently re
ceived from a former Stanford man
now in London, the matter comes
to a head tomorrow, "budget day, 1 '
when Neville Chamberlain, chan
cellor of the exchequer, decides
whether the $27.(i6 a barrel tax on
beer is too heavy. Quotes from the
letter follow:
"Since September 11, 1931, there
has been a lax of 130 shillings on
the standard barrel of beer. A re
bate of 20 shillings a bulk barrel
brings the total tax to about $27.66
as compared with the $1.80 a barrel
before the war.
"Local papers have named three
premises on which the tax is being

I fought: 1. The high (ax is killing a
I good source of revenue. 2. Retail
prices are driving beer-drinkers to
less wholesome beverages. 3. Agri
culture and allied industries are suf
fering.
"The biggest part of the people arc
drinking hard ciderâ€”it is just as
alcoholic as beer but not taxed. An
other drink . called "red biddy" is
very popular. This is a cheap wine
spiked with alcohol.
'"Campaign figures show that the
consumption has declined from an
average of 10.2 gallons per person in
1923 to 12.7 gallons during 1932. The
Treasury's own statements are being
used to show a drop in taxes. In
1933 the revenue was $401,000,000
and in 1932 $343,500,000.
"April 25 the question will be de
! cidcd when the Chancellor of the
Exchequer rules whether the tax
is too high or not.''
