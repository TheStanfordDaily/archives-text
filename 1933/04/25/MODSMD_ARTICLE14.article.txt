# LOOS IS SENT CONTRACT BY MOVIE STUDIO
## Mildred King May Portray Leading Role If Star Accepts Offer 
### Ann Hemingway 
With "Hawk Island" in its linal
week of rehearsal and presentation
set for this Friday night, an
nouncement was received late last
night that Mary Anita Loos, '35,
who enacts the part of Louise llol
lister in the murder play, has been
offered a motion picture contract.
The offer came from the studios
of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in con
nection with the current Jean Har
low film, on which Miss Loos' aunt,
Anita Loos, is writing the continu
ity. If accepted, the offer would
necessitate the substitution of an
understudy in Miss Loos' part and
perhaps materially affect the pre
sentation of the Howard Irving
Young opus.
This will not be Miss Loos' first
experience before the camera, in
asmuch as she has appeared in bit
roles in such films as "Bird of Para
disc," "The Crooked Circle," and
"Street Scene."
In "Hawk Island" Miss Loos has
the comedy role of Louise Hol
lister, a departure for her from
the Julia Scton of "Holiday" or
the Alda of "Death Takes A Holi
day." She has also appeared in
the Claieties and the Junior Opera
of last year.
Mildred King is understudying
Miss Loos in the role of Louise, and
thus Harold Helvenston has some
one ready to step into the part,
should Miss Loos accept the film
contract. Miss King was last seen in
"Death Takes A Holiday."
