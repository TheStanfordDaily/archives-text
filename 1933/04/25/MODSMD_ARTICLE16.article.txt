# Encina Formal Bids On Sale This Week For $2
## 
### 
While details neared completion,
j it was announced last night by Bill J
Drew, dance chairman, that bids for j
the Enema Formal would go on sale
this week for the lowest price ever
offered.
Last year's dance charged $3.50
for admittance; past years often
quoted five dollars as the tax. This
year, due to reduced prices and or
chestral co-operation, bids will be
sold for $2 without lessening the
quality of the dance in any sense.
The decoration scheme planned
I for the rejuvenated Encina lobby is
I modernistic, with black and silver
i predominating. Craig's Cardinals are
j expected to supply a fancy brand of J
syncopation.
