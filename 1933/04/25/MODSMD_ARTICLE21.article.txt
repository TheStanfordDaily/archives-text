# Young Invalids Happy At Convalescent Home

### BOB LETTS 
"Please, Miss Nurse, could I have
some more of those trees?" said a
crippled little inmate at the Stan
ford Convalescent Home when he
had scraped the last morsel of food
off his first dinner plate there.
"You don't mean 'trees,' ; ' the
nurse replied. "That's cauliflower.'
Th little kid looked puzzled, but
how was he to know? he said to
himself. It was the first time he had
ever seen the stuff, and it looked
more like trees than anything else
he had ever seen. And what was
more important, il was good end it
was plentiful. He could have ".sec
onds" if he wanted them. Just a
dream come true.
Miss Margaret Spande, head of the
convalescent home, told lots of
stories —on the humorous side—like
that when she showed members of
campus committees through the

i plant yesterday afternoon as Chair
man "Chuck" Otis completed ar
rangements for the annual drive
: here to raise funds for continuation
of the great work the home has
> been doing since 1.919.
A shriveled up little body that lies
bound up in a plaster cast that
| looks big as a barrel, has a big pair
of pop-eyes and a real kid's smile
sticking oul one end. All that 7-
| year-old Jimmy can move is his legs
a little bit and his arms enough to
.vpin a yellow and black top on the
table. He was admitted from a Sac
ramento valley (own on January 26,
a victim of tuberculosis of the
spine.
His face has a lot of freckles that
are slowly fading away because he
has to be handled like a hot-house
flower until his strength comes back
some. But the kid can take it.
