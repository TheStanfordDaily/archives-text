# Roth Moves To Keep Beer Out Of S. U. District
## University Will Fight To Last Ditch; May Sue To Get Palo Alto Land 
### JAY GRAVES 
Beer will not be sold in Palo Alto
shops if Stanford University can
help it, declared Comptroller Almon
E. Roth last night. Stanford now
stands prepared to fight the advent
of beer into Palo Alto to the last
ditch.
"The Board of Trustees," Roth
said last night, "has instructed the
University attorneys to appear on
its behalf in any legal proceedings
which involve the validity of the
mile and a half law or the validity
of the liquor forfeiture clauses in
deeds to property in which the
University holds reversionary in
terest, and to co-operate with the
city attorney in maintaining the
validity of such clauses.
"However, if the courts should
hold the forefeiture clause or the
mile and a half limit to be invalid,
with repeal of the 18th Amendment
all protection afforded against sale
of hard liquors or against the re
turn cf the saloon would be lost.
"The University therefore feels
that it has a real equity in the
Palo Alto situation and is deter
miner to sec that its position in
the matter is fully protected."
The University administration
stands ready to wage a finish light.
They will go the limit, even to con
fiscating Palo Alto business prop
erty, in a supreme effort to keep
beer off the campus.
