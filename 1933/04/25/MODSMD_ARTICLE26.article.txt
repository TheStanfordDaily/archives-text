Energetically pressing his case
for beer in Palo Alto, Adron A.
Beene, Palo Alto attorney, last
night expressed the opinion that
"when the sale of beer in Palo
Alto comes to a vote the citizens
will he 100 per cent ior it."
Beene, associated with Ed Fellows
for the defense of Harry Brady,
charged with sale of 3.2 beer in
violation of Palo Alto ordinances,
feels that the proponents of the con
gressional brew have a fair chance
to win their case in the courts.
Court May Okeh
"Judge Syer's court may rule that
no crime has been committed by
the sale of 3.2 beer, in which case
beer would be legal in Palo Alto,"
declared Beene. Barring an appeal
to a higher court the matter would
then be settled in favor of brew.
We, have an absolute cinch," he
pointed out, "since we are using two
methods of approach. Should we Ins -
our court case, it will immediately
come to a vote of the people of the
city of Palo Alto and they will go
wild in favor of beer."
Palo Alto merchants are losing
money under the present state of
affairs. Beene predicts that they
will bring pro-beer voters to tin
polls in "truck-loads."
Beene believes that Stanford can
not make the reversion clause in
the Palo Alto deeds effective on
beer. The clauses all prohibit the
sale oi "intoxicating liquors" and by
congressional definition, the new
brew is not intoxicating.
Therefore, unless the United
States Supreme Court reverses
Congress on its interpretation, tin'
clause under which the University
would seek to seize the property
would be void, Beene thinks.
Presentation of the petition to the
council is now a certainty, and a
vote will follow should the court
attempt fail.
