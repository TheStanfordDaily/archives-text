# Dispassionate Student the Hub of a Foamy Paly-Stanford Controversy
## 
### 
Legal beer, which lias Hooded the consciousness of local
< ilizcns and taxpayers with pro and con sentiments consider
ably stronger than the '1.2 per cent strength of the disputed
beverage, continues to leave the Stanford student unmoved
and unintoxieatcd.
The latest developments in the Palo Alto Stanford com
munity are rather startling. The University asserts that Hie
sale of intoxicating liquors in the town will give Stanford
legal title to the land upon which Palo Alto is built; the wet
spokesnfen of the town claim that a victory is certain, that
beer is surely coining to Palo Alto. Thus the latest knot is
lied. II the San .lose court decides that it is not illegal to sell
beer in Palo Alto, the wets have won, temporarily, and bar
ring au appeal. If the citizens vote for the sale of beer without
a judicial aflidavit that it is unintoxicaling, then Palo Alto
becomes part of the campus.
What does the Stanford student think of it all? His atti
tude, as iu most issues of public interest, is neither pro nor
eon. The Stanford man doesn't care one way or the other
whether beer is sold in Palo Alio. He has only the interest of
curiosity, which man commonly feels toward his neighbors.
The Stanford student is slightly amused at a town which,
through the unique provisions of its land deeds or through
the inclination of its citizens, deprives itself of all the legiti
mate business and revenue which the sale of beer is bringing
to other communities.
While legal and political wars are being waged about his
head and concerning his welfare, the Stanford man stands by,
the casual onlooker. The I niversily may move the gates to
the nethermost boundaries of Palo Alto, if necessary, to keep
'A. l 2 per cent beer away from the Stanford man, but he is un
exeited. Kither he doesn't like beer anyway, or he knows that
he can always get a glass at MenM
