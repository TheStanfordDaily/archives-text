# Scandal Sheet Authors Find Reading Public at Colleges
## 
### 
Which part of (he Sunday paper does the col lege student
read first over his cofl'ce and snail? That's a question seldom,
it ever, asked, and one on which no questionnaire lias ever
been circulated, it there is a question which has not been
straw-voted among college students. Only observation can
supply the answer, and observation gives a lot of answers,
with the financial pages, of course, trailing the list of sections
to he found in the Sunday metropolitan paper.
But observation discloses an alarming factâ€”that among
people of the upper ten per cent (which is one way of classi
fying college students) there are a surprising number who
exhibit considerable interest in the magazine section, or scan
dal sheet. They not only look at the photographs of partially
unclad women, but they read the section. The fact that they
read il is circumstantially proved by further observation,
which discovers formerly "conservative" metropolitan dailies
going in for bigger and better magazine sections, in direct
competition with the newspapers popularly designated as
"sensational."
Scandal or not, truth or lietion, sensationalism or conser
vatism, college students desert their classics on Sunday morn
ings long enough to read the magazine sections. II may mean
that college men are overestimated, but it more likely indi
cates lhal the college mail's sophistication is largely artificial.
