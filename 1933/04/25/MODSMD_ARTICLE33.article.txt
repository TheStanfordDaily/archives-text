## SATURDAY'S MEET CAUSES AN IDEA 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
The U.S.C. Track Meet Saturday 1
has had the local sports "experts"
(by admission if no other way) dis
cussing and fussmg for 69 hours—
nt this writing. It will probably keep
them occupied for many a day to
come. It is safe to say that they
never will stop talking about it—at
least not in our lifetime. But such
is the nature of experts that the ;
most obvious thing the Meet proved
has entirely escaped their attention.
That is to he expected.
For the tenth time in history, we
are meeting the Trojans in two com
bats ou the cinders ni one year. This,
while not epoch-making, will prob
ably be continued especially if both
meets are financially successful. ;
Money used to talk but since 1921), j
it bellows. The B.A.C. of course j
listens to bellowing. The experts
see in this double encounter nothing 1
but a double encounter.
But those of us who don't know
any better ask, why can't this dou
ble idoa be carried over to the grid
iron? We meet U.S.C. thrice a sea
son in baseball and four times in
basketball.'But only once in foot
ball. There is nothing sacred about
unity—one is only holy because it
is historic. If tradition can be broken
m track, why not football?
The most obvious advantage is the
monetary one. The U.S.C. game is
always a money-maker; it makes i
money in Los Angeles and it makes j
money in Palo Alto. Of course, if '
there were two games in the season, j

neither would draw quite as much j
as the one does now. But, together, J
they would draw many, many thou
sands more than the single game as [
at present.

Football is a great income-maker.
Without it, all the other sports would
either be cut or materially curtailed, j
Football, we remember, is the only j
sport that pays its own expenses; |
and of course tin* only one that j
shows a net profit. The depression ;
has hit football as it has hit steel,
cotton, wheat, and lhc other com- 1
modities. Two games with U.S.C., J
however, would retrieve its budget j
immensely.
The question can be raised that. •
two games with the powerful Tro- |
jans would be a hardship on the J
"boys." Far be it from me to place |
a hardship on anyone. The hardship j
can hx decreased by cutting out J
some of the minor games. There are
at least four outstandingly minor j
games headed by that, terrific deni- j
zen of the turf—San Jose.
Or if the "breathers" are neces- j
sary, we can play more substitutes I
in the "big" games; give more peo- \
pie a chance to be heroes. It would i
pay big—and the labor can be di- I
vided so as to burden no one ex- i
cept the Coach, and he gets paid
for his labor.
For the present, at least, there is j
enough insanity about, football, es- I
pecially football with U.S.C., to fur- j
nish spirit for both games—with ;
plenty left over.
