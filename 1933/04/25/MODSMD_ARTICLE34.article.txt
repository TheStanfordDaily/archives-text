TOPAZE (Radio) —At the California
Theat re.
For years John Barrymore has
been making for the films, pictures
in which he starred as a monster,
or a mad virtuoso, or a long-haired
hypnotist. In all of these Barrymore
utilized every trick known to the
actor and his performances were as
smooth as they were meaningless.
With far better material, however,
he has shown, if not a great advance
in genuinely emotional acting, at
least a release of latent powers
which is remarkable.
Even with so sentimental and ele
mentary a role as that of the Baron
in "Grand Hotel" he demonstrated
a power in straight playing which
he had been unable to exercise
through the series of technically
brilliant *nose-thumbings which the
series of abnormal characters
prompted.
His performance in "A Bill of
Divorcement," serious and finely
emotional, was sincere and poignant.
But in "Topaze," virtually a comedy
of one character, he does his best
work thus far.

I First as the plodding, idealistic i
professor in his classroom (a long !
j sequence, built slowly, meticulously, |
and delectably) and then as the j
turning worm (in which he plays j
high comedy as well as it has been j
played on the screen), his perform- |
: iince is remarkable.
The film—one of a sadly unprofit- j
able (I suspect) but. gratifyingly :
worthy series which Radio has j
; been producing along with a lament- j
able series of silly sentimental melo- '
dramas —is certainly one of the sea- '
■ son's best, eminently worth seeing. I

GABRIEL OVEK TIIE WHITE I
HOUSE (Metro) —At the Stanford 1
Theatre.
William Randolph Hearst over the j
White House and Walter Huston in- :
side: inside Mr. W. H. satisfactorily
j sets forth with stentorian pathos all
, the pet whimsys of Mr. W. R. IT. to
the tuneful accompaniment of j
everything from Beethoven to "John !
Brown's Body."
The picture is like nothing else
ever .seen on the screen; it is more
, than propaganda with a capital P; i

more than bunk with a capital B: it
is the apothesis of both.
The narrative has Walter Huston
as Judd Hammond, the president of
the United States and central figure.
We see him at first an easy-going,
vacillating leader. Then comes an
automobile accident; all is changed.
Gabriel (W.K.H.) is over the White
House. In rapid succession we see
the president fire his entire cabinet,
overcome a move to impeach him,
assume dictatorship, solve the un
employment problem, abolish gang
sters, blow up a fair-sized navy, and
settle the foreign debt situation. Ho
hum.
During this light recreation Mr.
Proxy has been aided by soft music,
dimming-lights, swaying curtains,
tinkling bells, Karen Morley, and
Franchot Tone. They all contribute
to the general festivity in their re
spective manners. Huston does all he
can with an impossible role which
turns out almost a monologue.
As an antidote: a thorough read
ing of "Of Thee I Sing." —Chapin
