NEW YORK—"While a cricket is
technically an insect and a bug, it
would appear from a study of his
life lhat instead of being obnoxious
he is an intellectual little fellow,
with certain attainments of refine
ment and an indefatigable musician

par excellence." —Municipal Court
Justice Nicholas Petty who handed
4 down a 12-page decision dealing
I with crickets and their music.
The cricket is quite a musician,
A remarkable tonal technician.
He's not temperamental,
For tunes instrumental
He'll fiddle without intermission.
