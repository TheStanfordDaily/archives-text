Al Saturday's still conversational
ly-important track meet, Don Lieb
endorfer was reannouncing the re
sults of the pole-vault. "Bud Dea
con," came Don's voice through the
public address system, "employed
his prerogative to pass his trials at
11 feet 6 inches and 12 feet. He then
tried 12 feet 6 inches once and
missed, dropping out after the one
attempt. Because Deacon passed the
two lower heights, Ramsey of
Southern California has a clear title
to third place."
And a law student yelled back
at the loud speaker: "Clear title?
Iluli, there ain't no such thing as
a 'clear title!' "
In the two most important track
meets in the United States, one im
portant because of its traditional and
emotional significance and the other
because of the calibre of the com
peting athletes and their perform
ances, not a captain scored a point.
Captain Ben Eastman of Stanford
did not compete in either the S.C.-
Stanford or Big meets because of in
juries; Captain Jim Miles of Cali
fornia, in a weakened condition,
could not place in the javelin; and
Captain Jeddy Welsh of Southern
California was shut out by Meier
Lyon, and Herbert in the highs and
did n it run in the lows.
Harry Maloney recently received
a letter from Chas. E. Logan in
fonnin." him of the contemplated or
ganization of ,a national, all-star
collegiate!soccer team to play at the
Chicago World's Fair and then to
1 ravel through England and Europe
on an extended tour. The letter re
quested that Maloney ask any
graduating seniors of outstanding
ability who were interested in the
team's formation to correspond with
Chas. E. Logan. Maloney has recom
mended Stanford's two all-Confer
ence fullbacks, Bus Holmes and Ed
Brekolbaum, and it is probable that i
they will trek to Chicago for ; fling |
at making the team.
It is doubtful if Stanford's achieve- j
merit in water polo last Saturday j
will ever be adequately appreciated!
by a campus that can appreciate lit- |
tie but football and track. The In
dian tankmen, coached by Nort I
Thornton, played on even terms !
through a full game and four extra j
periods with a hand-picked team of j
stars that reached the finals in the
Olympic Games to establish itself as j
the second finest, water polo team in \
the world.
It was the ambition of Los An
geles to have a Los Angeles water :
polo team in the Los Angeles Olym- ,
pics, and for that reason the team |
members were carefully chosen as I
individuals and then drilled together |
for months. And yet a Stanford i
team, with tynly a student body of |
three thousand to choose from, held
its own with that aggregation. The
only analogous situation I can con- j
ceive that might illustrate this ac
complishment would be an overtime
game between an all-American foot- J
ball team and a Stanford team.

In what I suppose was a magnani- (
mous attempt at fairness, Art Gier
lieh, sports editor of the "Daily Tro- |
jan,'' doped that recent track meet
7(i to 55. Dean Cromwell, apparently
a conservative at heart, said that 1
S.C. would win 66 to 65. Just to
show that I am generous with news, j
I now graciously notify Messrs. j
Gierlich and Cromwell that they
were wrong.
Incidentally, the Stanford Daily .
dope sheet was the closest, when j
total score is considered, to any 1 ;
have seen in print. But. if anyone |
mentions individual events to Spud j
Hamilton, Al Guerard, or myself, j
there may be need for an increase
in (he campus police force.
