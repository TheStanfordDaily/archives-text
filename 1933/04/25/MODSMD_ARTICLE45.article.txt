## 
### JAY GRAVES 
Stewart Hawlcy, only Card golfer '
left in the Northern California Ama
teur now being played at San Fran
cisco, is going to have a tough battle
when he meets Charlie Seaver, de
fending champion in the quarter
final rounds next Saturday, accord
ing to Coach Eddie Twiggs.
Hawley will have to play good golf (
to win against , Seaver, Eddie de- t
clares, but he's still of the opinion \
that Stew has a good chance to nose
out the former Stanford boy and
move on to the semi-finals.
Seaver will have to putt better 1
than he did against Hoag last week

' end or Stew may pull a now-fam
ous Stanford "come-through" act. If
Hawley continues to shoot as good
golf as he has been shooting, he'll
be able to stand up against anybody.
Gene Brown, who went down in
glorious defeat at the hands of his
teammate, Hawley, put up the best
i qualifying round scrap the field wit-
I nessed. Seven golfers tied for the
I last three places on the champion
ship flight. Gene played six holes
against keen competition, sank three
putts of over 20 feet, and fought out
three opponents for the last spot on
the flight.
Stages Comeback
Twiggs acclaims the feat as one
of the best instances of fighting out
of a hole that he has ever seen.
When Dick Giddings, Tom Dwyer,
and Jerry Trautman failed to quali
fy in ihe championship flight, and
■ then dropped out of the director's
! cup flight, Eddie didn't like it. They
should have played. These boys need
the experience, he feels, and they
, shouldn't throw away good experi
ence matches because they missed
the top ladder.
On the other hand, Payne Palmer,
Morse Erskine, Bill I-loelle, and Jim
Moser stuck to the director's flight
and Erskine and Hoelle have moved
up to the quarter finals with good
chances of going to the top.
