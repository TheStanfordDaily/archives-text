# FAST AND TRICKY BACKS TO GALLOP FOR GRID ELEVEN
## 
### Oliver Johnston, Jr 
As fast and as tricky a backfield
as has ever been seen in these parts
will represent the Indians next fall.
Shades of Dick Hyland and Phil
Moffat.
The speediest of them come from
this year's freshman team. Grayson,
Bronstien, and Reisner can all cover
! a hundred in around ten flat. Bob
Grayson, especially, combining his
198 pounds with these two factors,
! should be able to furnish those last
two feet to the goal line, which are
i so often needed and hard to get.
Van Dellen is perhaps the prettiest
runner on the squad. He is fast.
White runs somewhat as Van Dellen
does, though he is not as fast.
Hard Hitter
Bill Sim, who rase to fame last
fall, hits as hard as anyone on the
! squad, and is just as hard to bring
down. Kenny Afflerbaugh, lately
shifted to quarter, has given the
fans some thrilling moments.
Frank Alustiza from the frosh,
who has also been shifted to quar
ter, is one of the most versatile men
on the squad. He passes, kicks, and
runs equally well. Ray Lewis,
brother of "Spud," should develop
into an excellent passer.
Maentz Hard Hitter
I Handicapped with an injured
knee most of last fall, Bob Maentz
did not get a chance to show his
real capabilities. He is not very fast
but is effective on off-tackle plays
because of his hard hitting and
strong straight-arm.
In Jack Hillman's absence, Wes
Stevens is taking the leading full
back role. Probably the greatest
blocker who has come to Stanford
during the last decade, is Bones
Hamilton.
