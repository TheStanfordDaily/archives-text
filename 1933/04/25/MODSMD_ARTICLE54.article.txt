# OAKLAND ACORNS STILL AT TOP OF PACIFIC COAST LEAGUE BASEBALL RACE
## 
### 
With Oakland still resting at the
top of the heap but with second
place Sacramento creeping up, the
Coast League enters the fourth
week of its schedule with the possi
bility of a big shake-up in the
standings.
The Acorns travel to Los Angeles
to meet the Seraphs who won their
last three games in a row from
Sacramento after dropping the first
foui" last week. The Angels are tied
for third place behind the Senators
but may better their position thi.->
week.
Sacramento with a veteran infield
and a hard-hitting ball club expects
to fatten its average in the coming
series against the spotty Seals. San
Francisco has been a distinct disap
pointment so far this season, playing
in-and-out baseball with the hurling
of young Lee Stine being one of the

few bright lights against a dead
background.
Portland, last year's pennant win
ner, moved up in the standings
when they dropped Hollywood's
Stars five games to two last week.
The Beavers are tied for third place
now while the Missions and Holly
wood are in a deadlock for fifth
with San Francisco seventh and
Seattle in the cellar.
