# Hables To Run Exhibition At Irish Relay
## 
### 
With the S.C. meet safely tucked
under the Indian war-belt, the last
attraction on the list of Farm track
events has been scheduled for 3
o'clock next Friday by the Quad
rangle Clubâ€”namely, the Irish
Marathon.
Les Hables, he of the many ap
pellations and flying feet, will per
form an exhibition hundred-yard
dash. Some of Stanford's muscular
field artists are slated to run a 50-
yard dash.
Run On an interclass basis, the
main feature of the day will be the
24-man one lap each relay. Entrants
for this event, as well as all others,
should sign with the senior track
manager at the B.A.C. as soon as
possible.
Along with these more-or-less
ethical track events will come a
multitude of others, which will turn
the day's affair into something re
sembling a brick-carriers' picnic.
There will be a heel-and-toe 440, a
backward 100-yard dash, a three
legged race, and obstacle race
steeplechase, and a bicycle race.
A small admittance charge will
be collected, with the Quadrangle
Club using the proceeds to establish
a scholarship for incoming frosh
track material. Prizes are being do
nated by Palo Alto merchants to the
winners of the various ludicrous
contests to be performed on Angell
Field Friday.
