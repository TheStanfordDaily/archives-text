# Haley Pleads For Inflation As Cure
## Nation's Fate In Balance, Economist Warns 
### Sheridan Hegland 
While the institution of a policy
of expansion and attempted control
must, be inherently dangerous, a
greater danger bringing with it the
possibilities of more disastrous re
sults would be invited if deflation
were permitted to continue its vi
cious spiral to "rock-bottom."'
This is the opinion of Bernard
Francis Haley, associate professor
of economics and head of his de
partment., as expressed last night
in an interview.
America has been caught on the
horns of a dilemma, lie stated. One
road—monetary and credit expan
sion—leads a perilous road to eco
nomic recovery, hut to take it the
nation must court the possibility
that this expansion be carried too
far.
Inflation, if carried too far,
would double—or slash in half—the
wealth of any individual, impover
ishing here, making wealthy there.
However, such fears, Haley feels,
have often been exaggerated.
Blacker Picture
But an even blacker picture is
sketched for the alternative—con
tinued deflation. Over a fourth of
those gainfully employed in 1929 are
now jobless. Thousands of business
firms have already gone over the
brink of bankruptcy; hundreds mare
are on the verge of liquidation.
Bankruptcy, he warned, is con
tagious; "reorganizations" spread
like wildfire. Up to a week ago—
when the threat of inflation ar
rested the movement—the nation
found itself plunging deeper and
deeper.
Blasting the popular fallacy that
deflation leads to a situation where
"consumption" exceeds "production"
—and prosperity naturally follows—
Haley warned that there is nothing
about, the modern business cycle
that necessarily and inevitably
brings about the end of the de
pression.
"As far as I know, there has been
no depression in modern times that
has 'worked itself out.' Nearly al
ways at the turning point, one can
find a stroke of luck that turned the
trick," he stated.
"A happily large harvest, a heavy
demand from our export markets,
the discoveries of new stores oi
gold, or the development of a new
industry," Haley said, have usually
coincided with the beginnings of
economic recovery.
And barring a stroke of luck—
or a carefully conceived and well
cxccuted policy of controlled in
flation—the current depression
might drive the nation to the ul
timate rock-bottom, providing ol*
course that social revolution does
not interrupt.
On the other hand a policy of
carefully controlled inflation may
well lead to a gradual, but healthy,
business recovery. Rising prices
stimulate business activity leading
to increasing profits, increasing
earnings for labor, and diminishing
unemployment. The danger lies in
the possibility that political pressure
might make control impossible.
Can Be Controlled
Anti-inflationists point to the fate
of post-war Germany. But the con
ditions were entirely dissimilar.
Germany was under a terrific han
dicap. Pressure was brought to bear
on her foreign exchanges and at
home she had a budget that would
not stay balanced to contend with.
England, who dropped the gold
standard in 1931, has kept her
currency from fluctuating wildly—
that fate that is supposed to be
enjoyed by every nation institut
ing inflation.
And while sectionalism in this
country—the Middlewest pleading
for continued inflation; the financial
East arrayed against it—might in
crease the dangers of inflation, still
the chance is preferable to a do
nothing policy.
The authorities of Oxford Uni
versity not too long ago voted
against the installation of baths as
the undergraduates attended college
only eight months out of the year.
