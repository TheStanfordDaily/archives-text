# Haley Pleads For Inflation As Cure
## Nation's Fate In Balance, Economist Warns 
### Sheridan Hegland 
While the institution of a policy
of expansion and attempted control
must, be inherently dangerous, a
greater danger bringing with it the
possibilities of more disastrous re
sults would be invited if deflation
were permitted to continue its vi
cious spiral to "rock-bottom."'
This is the opinion of Bernard
Francis Haley, associate professor
of economics and head of his de
partment., as expressed last night
in an interview.
America has been caught on the
horns of a dilemma, lie stated. One
road—monetary and credit expan
sion—leads a perilous road to eco
nomic recovery, hut to take it the
nation must court the possibility
that this expansion be carried too

Inflation, if carried too far,
would double—or slash in half—the
wealth of any individual, impover

But an even blacker picture is
sketched for the alternative—con

those gainfully employed in 1929 are
now jobless. Thousands of business
firms have already gone over the
brink of bankruptcy; hundreds mare
are on the verge of liquidation.
Bankruptcy, he warned, is con
tagious; "reorganizations" spread
like wildfire. Up to a week ago—
when the threat of inflation ar
rested the movement—the nation
found itself plunging deeper and
deeper.
Blasting the popular fallacy that
deflation leads to a situation where
"consumption" exceeds "production"
—and prosperity naturally follows—
Haley warned that there is nothing
about, the modern business cycle
that necessarily and inevitably
brings about the end of the de
pression.
"As far as I know, there has been
no depression in modern times that
has 'worked itself out.' Nearly al
ways at the turning point, one can
find a stroke of luck that turned the
trick," he stated.
"A happily large harvest, a heavy
demand from our export markets,
the discoveries of new stores oi
gold, or the development of a new
industry," Haley said, have usually
