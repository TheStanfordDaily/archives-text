# ANSWER MADE TO COMMITTEE ON BOOKSTORE
## Board Of Directors States Suggested Changes Not Advisable 
### 
In a letter addressed to William
Cor bus, president of the Associated
Students, the Board of Directors of
the Stanford Bookstore yesterday
made answer to the investigating
committee's recommendations for
more economic operation.
Stating the "purpose of the
Bookstore is to render 'best pos
sible service,'" the directors,
headed by Dr. E. P. Lesley, de
clared that this service can be
maintained only when (I) an in
ventory large enough to cover the
varied needs of even small num
bers of students is stocked, (2)
enough employees are oil hand to
insure prompt service, and (15)
only "salespeople who are familiar
with the stock"' are retained.
The letter then discusses six sub
jects dealt with in the student com
mittee's report:
SALARY CUTS: Since Bookstore
employees were placed on a five-day
week with proportional salary re
ductions on February 1 last, the Di
rectors feel that further cuts now
arc neither "feasible nor just."
DISCHARGE OF EMPLOYEES:
Because it is the duty of an em
ployer "to furnish as continuous and
regular employment as possible" and
because "it is good business to keep
one's organization intact," it: is felt
that discharge is unwarranted.
BONUSES: The Directors believe
it more important to retain present
salary and employment standards in
a depression than to perpetuate the
bonus system. Last autumn it was
decided to pay no further bonuses
until business increases so justified.
STOCK: "A considerable reduc
tion has already been efTected with
a marked saving to students. Any
further reduction in the number of
items in each line would mean
poorer service to the students and
probably little or no additional
profit."
MARK-DOWN RECORDS: "In
view of the general nature of the
stock involved," and because in
creased clerical service would be
necessitated by extension of this
system into all departments, the Di
rectors think it best to use them
only in the Textbook Department.
ADVERTISING: When advertis
ing has been tried by the Bookstore,
the sales returns have not justified
it.
The answer concludes: "The Board
of Directors of the Bookstore de
sire to state their sincere apprecia
tion of the fine spirit in which this
investigation w;ls made and the
thoroughness with which the work
has apparently been done."
A copy of the Directors' answer
may be read in the A.S.S.U. office.
