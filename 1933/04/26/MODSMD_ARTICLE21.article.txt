I WASHINGTON, April 25 (/!') —
President Roosevelt's inflation pro
! ject rode another wave of stormy
debate in the Senate today with Re
! publicans denouncing it as uncon
stitutional and an "inevitable shock
i to confidence" and Democrats de
| fending it as a "conservative meas
ure with no wild inflation in it."
Although several compromises
i were reported in the making—ef
| forts to strike out authorization for
! reducing the gold content of the
j dollar in return for more liberal
j silver coinage or purchase features—
| administration leaders predicted its
j passage tomorrow virtually as pre-
Isented.
