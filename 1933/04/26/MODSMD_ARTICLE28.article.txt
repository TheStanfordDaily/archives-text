# Bridge Tournament Offers Painless Method of Charitable Giving
## 
### 
Charitable giving until il should hurl bill doesn't, like
painless dentistry, has hccoinc the fad. The committee in
charge of the present (lonvaleseenl Home drive has sensed
Ihe changing trend in ways and means of drumming up
funds for charitahlc purposes, as evidenced hv their plans
for an all-campus bean-feed. The idea behind such drive
technique is that llie donor gets something for his moncv,
or thinks he does, and therefore gives more frcelv.
Members of the local bridge club and the Daily stall',
both being addicts of the pasteboards, met yesterday and
cooked up a charily racket of llicir own the all-campus
contract bridge tournament. Primary of the tourney's pur
poses. of course, is llie donation of a sum of several dollars
lo the worthy Convalescent Home drive. There are other
minor purposes stimulation and encouragement of the
favorite indoor sport, the selection of a Stanford team for
inter-club competition, and the valuable experience prom
ised campus bridge experts through actual tournament
play but the big thing is the Convalescent Home.
The rules of llie contest are simple and few, the length
of the sessions will be short, the purpose is worthy. Only
the result of the tournament is indeterminate. That de
pends upon the response given the idea bv Stanford's fra
ternity, sorority, and dormitory disci pies of the slam-Yar
borough pastime.
in sponsoring a Stanford contract bridge tournament,
the Daily feels Unit it is offering a considerable number of
students the most painless and pleasant method yet de
vised for contributing to Stanford's own charity. The con
testants will gel an afternoon of brain-teasing hrid ge for
their four hits, while two of the entrants will earn the dis
tinction of being acclaimed Stanford's bridge champions,
with silver trophies on the mantel attesting lo their dislinc-
I ion.
