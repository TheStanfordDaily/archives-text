### 
Last spring I lie Daily's Mr. Mellinkoff waged a vigorous
])111 ineffective battle to reduce the price of Senior Hall
bids. I lis opinion, which was that of a large number of the
( lass of \T2, was that ten dollars was too much to pay in a
year of depression. However, the price of bids remained
at ten dollars.
This year Senior Hall moguls have glimpsed the writing
011 the walls and forestalled probable criticism by slashing
the tarill to seven dollars. The three-dollar cut was ef
fected mainly by eliminating the favors that have pre
viously cluttered up graduates' hall-bedrooms for a few
months and have then been chucked out.
Hv this action, commendable in its shrewdness, the
committee has been able to keep the other features of the
Hall the orchestra, the breakfast, the decorations, all the
trimmings at the 1932 level, and yet has done an admir
able favor to campus pocketbooks by the drop in the price.
Seniors, in this year of grace, are having a rough time
of it in all directions. Anv move to smooth their paths
linanciallv is laudable.
