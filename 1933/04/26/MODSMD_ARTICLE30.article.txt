# The
						Bookstore Replies— Student Probe Ends in Blind Alley
## 
### 
Yesterday the sequel was written to an investigation
begun some time ago when several students glanced at the
Hookstore and asked, "Why?" Nobody answered, so the
students undertook to discover the answer on their own
hook, and at the invitation of the Hookstore's board of di
rectors. The students got the answer, but they failed, as it
was only inevitable that they should fail, to arrive at the
answer of the more enlightening and more significant
question, "Ilow come?"'
Hut the student investigating committee was satisfied
that it had accomplished something and submitted a report
which recounted the facts and conditions observed, with
out mention of the indiscernable causes behind those con
ditions. The Hookstore directors took a look at the student
report, then went into a huddle, from which they emerged
yesterday with a lengthy and detailed answer of the query,
"I low come?"
II seems that the Hookstore operates under a policy, a
fact which the investigating students and their sympathetic
fellows had never suspected. And any investigation of a
business institution which is policy-conscious, presumably
intended to determine actual facts from facts observed, is
i sually wasted lime.
The student investigation of the Hookstore came too
late, and at the same time 100 soon. If the recommenda
tions of the student committee had been made a year ear
lier, then that committee would have had the satisfaction
of seeing its suggestions incorporated into the Hookstore's
present policy. If, on lite other hand, the suggestions
should be made a year hence, providing that prosperity
does not round the Stanford corner within that lime, the
Bookstore would most likely adopt just such measures as
the students now recommend.
Hut the Hookstore appears to have answered for the
present situation quite logically and satisfactorily.
