## OFFICES FOR EVERYONE AND HIS COUSIN 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
i Student government is usually
I
I pretty funny, but when the women
| have an election the usual comedy
! becomes a farce. Not because the
women are outstandingly humorous,
i but just because women in politics
j is an amusing situation fundamen
, tally. And Stanford women politi
| cians are the acme of fun provoca
tion —the little devils.
I
1 Why the women need a separate
I student organization is quite un
understandable. The major student
I government has men and women
' within its fold and the A.W.S. is
simply an organization within an
organization — complexity within
i complexity — offices pyramided on
' offices. Of course they cost practi
i cally nothing, accomplish just about
' that much, and give the girls just
j so many more titles with which to
I adorn themselves.
! A new black ensemble assists
! rushing, but a couple of presidents
! flitting about (he living room aids
immeasurably. Even these things
called vice-presidents have their
value. Far be it from our purpose to
single out the women as the sole
sinners. That would' be sex preju
dice in its worst form. The men,
too, are simply infested with officers
and organizations. The purposes of
j these myriad organizations is un
] known, impossible of determination;
j and who cares, anyway?

I greater simplicity will produce
I charts showing in what a mess this

or that government is. I challenge
anyone to produce a chart on one
piece of paper capable of being un
folded on any table north of the
Tehachapi on which all of Stanford's
governmental units can be shown.
The result would look like 8 rat
mazes, 22 tangled balls of yarn, and
3 pots of spaghetti superimposed on
each other and stirred strenuously |
for 3'j days. Complexity is the key
note.
Then we ask students who have
only 4 years on the campus to take
an interest in student government.
They might, but they can't. It's too
complicated to understand in any
thing short of a lifetime. The safest
thing is to ignore the whole busi
ness. Most students play safe. They
might possibly participate if things
were reduced to a mortal plane—
simplified to a point where we could
know what was happening some of
the time at least.
The trouble is that at Stanford
once an organization is established
it remains, though people forget
1 why it was ever started. Each gen
eration adds to the mess with the
present situation as the result. The
Executive Council might stop creat
ing anything for several meetings
and spend its time removing rotten
timber and dusting away layers of
deadhead officers.
Oh. yes, I forget that the Asso
; ciated Women Students does see to j
it that the "500" are in bed at the
proper hour. That is a genuine piece
[ of governmental enterprise.
