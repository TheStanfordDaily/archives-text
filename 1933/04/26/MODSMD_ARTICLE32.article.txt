A SURVEY OF KECO R I) E I)
AMERICAN MUSIC — I—George
Gershwin.
The student of serious American
music is at a decided disadvantage
when desirous of hearing competent
performances of important works.
That great mass of humanity known
as the general public has apparent
ly yet to learn that Americans are
capable of producing .something
other than fine automobiles, tall
buildings, and short-lived popular
tunes. Since musical enterprises,
i like everything else in this com
i mercialized age, must keep at least
j one eye on the exchequer and not
j allow the other to stray very far
1 away, a group of extremely talented
j native composers have had to strug
| gle along with a small, though ap
j preciative, number of supporters,
j and with almost no way of contact
! ing people outside of the principal
| musical centers.
The situation, however, is not be
yond hope. Strenuous efforts on the
I radio in behalf of American music
| by Messrs. Stokowski, Koussevitsky,
j Damrosch, Whiteman, and others,
I the recent overwhelming success of
! Louis Gruenberg's opera, "The Em
! peror Jones," and an awakening in
j terest in American musical accom
plishments on the part of the re-
I cording companies, have enabled
our composers to seek an ever
( widening market for their product.
The phonograph is the real solu
tion of the problem. Nowhere else
! can the student familiarize himself
so carefully with the best produc
tion in modem musical art. This
survey, then, is designed to aid him
in seeing just what has been ac
' complished in the recording of good
I American music. To be sure, the
' field has been as yet comparatively
j untouched; the majority of the best
I composers are not well represented
1 on the lists—which do not, however,
i lack interest. The survey is by no
' means complete, embracing only the
j work of the major composers avail -
j able at most music stores. For an
j exhaustive list, including imported
! recordings and those of smaller
j companies, the reader is referred to
the general catalog of the Grama
! phone Shop, New York.
i I.—Most popular of American
j composers is George Gershwin, who
j has had four of his six major works
j put on wax. First, of course, came
I the phenomenally successful "Rhap
sody in Blue," played for Victor by

f Paul Whiteman's orchestra, the
composer at the piano; this perform
ance of the work has yet to be sur
passed. A year anct a half later, by
commission of the New York Sym
i phony Society, Gershwin wrote his
j "Concerto in F"—first reading a
book to discover precisely what a
concerto might be. Shortly after its
! initial performance it was orches
trated for Paul Whiteman. Columbia
I issued it in album form, this time
, with Roy Bargy at the keyboard.
The performance was excellent, but
we cartnot help feeling that it lost
much in performance by a small
group.
Shortly after, Columbia issued an
important piano recording by
Gershwin of his Preludes 1, 2, and 3,
together with the Andante of the
Rhapsody. The Preludes were writ
ten for a concert tour Gershwin
made with Peruvian Madame D'Al
varez, in an effort to gain appre
ciation for jazz.

Two years later Victor recorded
"An American in Paris," played by
the Victor Symphony Orchestra,
Nathaniel Schilkret conducting,
Gershwin at the piano. This deli
cious work—considered by many to
be Gershwin's best—is well per
formed on these discs. —Dahl

i I.—Most popular of American

j has had four of his six major works
j put on wax. First, of course, came
I the phenomenally successful "Rhap
sody in Blue," played for Victor by

f Paul Whiteman's orchestra, the
composer at the piano; this perform
ance of the work has yet to be sur
passed. A year anct a half later, by
commission of the New York Sym
i phony Society, Gershwin wrote his
j "Concerto in F"—first reading a
book to discover precisely what a
concerto might be. Shortly after its
! initial performance it was orches
trated for Paul Whiteman. Columbia
I issued it in album form, this time
, with Roy Bargy at the keyboard.
The performance was excellent, but
we cartnot help feeling that it lost
much in performance by a small
group.
Shortly after, Columbia issued an
important piano recording by
Gershwin of his Preludes 1, 2, and 3,
together with the Andante of the
Rhapsody. The Preludes were writ
ten for a concert tour Gershwin
made with Peruvian Madame D'Al
varez, in an effort to gain appre
ciation for jazz.

Two years later Victor recorded
"An American in Paris," played by
the Victor Symphony Orchestra,
Nathaniel Schilkret conducting,
Gershwin at the piano. This deli
cious work—considered by many to
be Gershwin's best—is well per

The student of serious American

performances of important works.
That great mass of humanity known

capable of producing .something
other than fine automobiles, tall
buildings, and short-lived popular
tunes. Since musical enterprises,
i like everything else in this com
i mercialized age, must keep at least
j one eye on the exchequer and not
j allow the other to stray very far
1 away, a group of extremely talented
j native composers have had to strug
| gle along with a small, though ap
j preciative, number of supporters,
j and with almost no way of contact
! ing people outside of the principal
| musical centers.
The situation, however, is not be
yond hope. Strenuous efforts on the
I radio in behalf of American music
| by Messrs. Stokowski, Koussevitsky,

I the recent overwhelming success of
! Louis Gruenberg's opera, "The Em
