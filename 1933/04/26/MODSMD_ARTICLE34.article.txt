WASHINGTON, April 25 (/P) —
President Roosevelt tonight brought
.to bear every resource of his char
acteristically direct diplomacy in an
effort to solve two of the greatest
of post-war problems—heavy debts
and huge armaments.
While details were carefully
guarded for fear a leak would wreck
the plans, the word spread that the
President, Prime Minister Ramsay
Mac Donald of Great Britain, and
former Premier Edouard Herriot of
France were well on their way to
an understanding on these matters
as part of a comprehensive program
of world rehabilitation.
A student at Louisiana State Uni
versity, convicted of criminal libel
for his manner of editing "The
Whangdoodle," a campus "scandal
sheet," was pardoned from a one
year prison sentence after spending
a few days in jail.
