A little ragged kid, made ner
vously courageous by the desire to
see his sports page heroes in action,
attempted to crawl under the Sta
dium If-nce at a recent athletic event.
He had almost succeeded, when a
burly, zealous guard, sporting a noisy
sweater and a long stick, saw the
kid.
The guard seized the youthful
delinquent and began to beat him
all over the body with the stick.
The big man continued his' indus
trious belaboring until he forced
the crying little boy out of the
Stadium. And as the child, sob
bing, went through the gale, the
guard tripped him—carefully and
successfully.
A still bigger man from the city,
who hi.d been watching the affair,
went up to the guard and planted a
massive fist against the ambitious
stick-wielder's jaw. The guard fell
and the revengeful pugilist, who was
only a no-account from the Mission
District, swore.
Such are the results of bullying
zealousness, and the lessons in man
ners thai can be taught Stanford
gentlemen by Mission District bums.
The customary hair-cuttees and
loungers were gathered in the En
cina Barber Shop just before the
B.C. meet. Track was, of course, the
conversation that harmonized with
the .staccato of clippers and scraping
combs.
Paavo Nurmi came up for discus
sion, and sincere praisew as directed
al the great Finn as his times in the
distances were compared with those
expected to be made that day.
Among other things, Nurmi's accom
plishments in the Olympics were
mentioned.
A little lad, who apparently was
oil' for the Mark that night and
was receiving the necessary hair
cut and wondering to himself
when he would be big enough for
a shave (lie was a Stanford man,
but a small one) said:
"Who is this Nurmi guy? A
member of the S.C. track team?"
Of all the sports at Stanford, soc
cer is probably the least publicized.
It is also probably the most fun to
play. At any rate, the soccer team
implores of Harry Maloney every
evening to let them play after the
final whistle has blown, and some
times they ai'e allowed their extra
five minutes of scrimmage.
Compare that to the ■ footballers
who break for the showers coinci
dentally with the coaches' glance
at their watches. —Dick Strousc
