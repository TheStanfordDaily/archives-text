# OLYMPIANS, FAREWELL!
## TEMPLETON WILL REST INJURED TRACK STARS; I.C.-4A NOW GOAL 
### Albert Guerard, Jr Feg Murray, '16 
His invaluable leg free from the t
aid of crutches only since Friday,
Een Eastman looked forward to an
unhappy May 6th when Stanford's
"national dual meet track cham- '
pions" will face U.S.C. in a return
encounter at Los Angeles.
It may be the depressing weather, ,
but the dismal opinion rife in In
dian track circles is that B'en Bangs 1
will not face the Trojans.
Once again Stanford must "corns
through" in a manner which will
make up for the loss of Eastman's
almost certain fifteen points. But
can they do it? Will Lloyd Schween
again be able to approach the Pacific
Coast high jumping record and de
feat Olympic veterans Malcolm Mc-
Naughton and Bob Von Osdel? Will
Gus Meier? That 67-64 glorious vic
tory notwithstanding, a haze of un-

! certainty still hangs over most of
the events to be contested a week
from Saturday.
One thing is certain. The compli
-1 cated and unsuccessful strategy
which cost Phil Morentin a victory
in his favorite event last week has
, been dropped. The game Stanford
distance star will tangle with Dave
Foore in the two-mile. Dink Tem
pleton thinks Morentin will win.
Meanwhile, Bud Deacon still is
carefully favoring his torn muscles.
He, too, may be kept out of the
second Trojan meet, because the
season's objective, the 1.C.4-A.
championship, has now transcended
dual meet competition. If competing
against Troy would endanger Ben's
and Bud's chances of complete re
covery, they will be scratched from
the entry list.
