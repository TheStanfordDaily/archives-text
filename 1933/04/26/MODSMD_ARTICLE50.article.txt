# NEW PROSPECTS AID COACH BUNN IN BUILDING NEXT YEAR'S QUINTET
## 
### 
With 30 men reporting from
4 to 6 on Tuesday and Thursday
afternoons in the Basketball Pavil
ion, Coach John Bunn is already
laying a solid foundation for the
1933-34 Indian five. Although only
two o 1 next year's returning letter
men have turned out, Captain Ede
len and Al Page, several other new
prospects have donned suits.
Among the most promising is Bud
Shreve, former Menlo Junior College
star, w ho appears to be an excellent
forward prospect. Al Hershey also
is much in evidence and is perform
ing at center.
Farber and Viguie form the lone
members of last season's frosh quin
ted to turn out for the spring ses
sions. Greenlee and Mannion are
both cut of school this quarter and
Captain Addie Barnett, one of the
best frosh prospects to ever enter
the University, was killed in a tragic
auto mishap.
Several members of Bunn's 1932-
33 machine have also been on hand,
taking advantage of the practice as
an opportunity to keep in shape.
By running the practice sessions in
connection with his basketball meth
ods class, Coach Bunn is also af

fording an opportunity for those
hopefuls who aspire to enter the
coaching vocation to obtain some ex
cellent experience by actually al
lowing each member a chance to do
some coaching.
To make the sessions more effec
tive, the class has been divided into
four groups which participate
against each other. Fundamentals
are being particularly stressed and
in order to keep a close check 011
each man, Coach Bunn has devised
a rating method whereby a close
record is retained of each member's
dribbling, passing, shooting, and
other fundamentals.
