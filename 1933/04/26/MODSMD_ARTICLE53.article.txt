By Oliver Johnston, Jr.
Indicating that he is getting a bit
curious to see what 22 of his best
men can do when lined up against
each other, Coach Tiny Thornhil!
has ordered a scrimmage for to
night.
At present line-ups stand as fol
lows: Norgard at right end, with
acrobatic Keith Topping playing the
second-string position; Norwood at
left end, and Moscrip and Grunsky
alternating in second place.
Ed Lettunich is holding down the
' right tackle job with Holwerda at
the left side of the line. Two hun
dred twenty pougd Wes Mulier is
playing behind Lettunch and Ben
Palamountain is playing second fid
dle to Holwerda. At the guard posi
tion last year's first-stringers, Cor
bus, at right, and Kite at left, are
still at the top of the heap, with
Rouble and Adams on the second
string. Bill Bates, the only experi
enced center on the squad, will get
quite a bit ofc ompetition from Alf
Brandin.
At the quarter position Kenny
Afflerbaugh and Frank Alustizia
are fighting it out, with Kenny hav
ing a little the best of it. Buck Van
Dellen and Bill Sim are playing the
right and left halves. Van Dellen,
especially, will receive competition
from his understudy in the person
of Bones Hamilton, ( although Sim
cannot expect to rest with Maentz
at his heels.
At present Grayson is playing be
hind Stevens, but his good all
around play will probably put him
on an even footing before long.
