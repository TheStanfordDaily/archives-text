# TRANSFER FROM LAUSANNE CONTRASTS STANFORD WITH SWISS COLLEGE LIFE
##

Comparison of American and Eu- '
ropean college life as observed by
Alberto Navarro, recently returned
from the University of Lausanne in
Switzerland, shows some distinct, j
points in favor of life on the Stan
ford Farm.
One of the most striking differ
ences he noticed is the greater com- r
fort and convenience of living con
ditions here. Navarro said the con
ditions existing at the Swiss college
are deplorable.
He also gave Stanford the benefit
of the contrast in discussing co-eds.
"Women attending Lausanne are
extremely unattractive," he said. '

I "However, there are plenty of
pretty girls from the town who wait
for the students outside the class
rooms."
Swiss students are not teetotalers,
j according to Navarro, but they pre
fer beer and wine to stronger
drinks.
Commenting on the quality of the
f radio programs in Europe, compared
to radio entertainment in the United
States, the Swiss transfer praised
the superiority of American broad
casting.
"The radio programs in Europe
are terrible," said Navarro." "In j
America the wider range of enter
' tainment offered is most gratifying.'
