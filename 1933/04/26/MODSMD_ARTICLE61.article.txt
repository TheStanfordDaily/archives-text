DEL MONTE, April 24 (/P)â€”Medi
cine stands at the crossroads and
unless doctors lead the way, politi
cians will, Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur,
President of Stanford University,
told the California Medical Associa
i tion Convention today.
The former President of the
American Medical Association, chair
man of its committee on costs of
medical care, and more ' recently
Secretary of the Interior, soundly
rapped governmental interference in
medicine.
"I lived and slept with govern
ment bureaucrats for four years and
I am afraid of them,'' he declared.
