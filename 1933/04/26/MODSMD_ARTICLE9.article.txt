NEW YORK, April 25 (VP)—Mrs.
F. Ambrose Clark says she'll never
run Kellsboro .)ack, winner of the
1933 Grand National, over the diffi
cult Aintree course again.
"I may try again," she said on her
arrival here from England, "for the
thrill of winning was very great.
But I'll never ask Kellsboro Jack
to try again after his wonderful
record-breaking performance, and I
will not ask any other horse of
mine to submit to such a heart
breaking ordeal until I am satisfied
I have a real champion, one almost
bound to win if he starts."
She revealed she had bought the
Grand National winner from her
husband two years ago for one
pound just after Kellsboro Jack had
run a disappointing race.
