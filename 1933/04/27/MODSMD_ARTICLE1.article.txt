# CITY CONFIDENT AS BEER ISSUE GOES TO COURT
## Palo Alto Petition Reaches Goal Of 600 Signers; May Go Higher OLD AGREEMENT CITED Stanford Action Based On Amendment Repeal 
### Jay Graves 
As the Palo Alto beer petition
reached its original goal of 000
names and its enthusiastic backers
prepared to push the quota still
higher, up to 800 if possible, City
Attorney Arnold Rumwell remained
confident (hat he would win his case
in the Santa Clara County Superior j
Court this morning.
Rumwell believes that Judge R. R.
Syer will rule that a crime has been
committed by the sale of 3.2 beer
in Palo Alto in the habeas corpus j
proceedings growing out of the ar- :
rest of Harry Brady, charged with
sale of the brew in violation of city J
ordinances.
Agreement Cited
The intervention of Stanford at- !
torneys will not materially change :
the attitude of the court today, [
Rumwell thinks. Judge Sycr will
be deciding a question of fact, and j
to that extent he won't care whether
the University is interested or not. j
Kumwcll reiterated a statement
made recently by Comptroller |
Koth, that many people made
their homes in Palo Alto because
they believed the town wouid be
kept "dry."
Roth recalled that at the time of
the founding of Palo Alto, there was |
a tacit agreement between the Uni- i
versity trustees and Timothy Hop- |
kins, founder of the town, that the j
town would be kept dry. All Palo I
Alto property is reversionary to the i
University should intoxicating li- ,
quor be sold.
Future in View
"Every reason for the restrictions :
against the sale of intoxicating li- j
quors in the vicinity of the Univer- ;
sity which applied before the adop- ;
tion of the 18th Amendment still ap- |
plies," said Roth in an official state
ment. "The question is more than j
Ihe legality of 3.2 beer. We cannot :
permit the weakening of liquor re- j
strictions when the return of hard j
liquor seems imminent."
"When this matter conies to a
vote, as I believe it eventually
will," declared Attorney Rumwell,
"the interest of the University in 1
keeping beer out of Palo Alto will
have a great effect upon the
voters."
