# Encina Dance Bids On Sale
## 
### 
One hundred fifty bid.-, to the En
cina Formal go on sale at the
A.S.S.U. office today. The May 5
dance will be the cheapest formal
ever presented by the Encina Club
with the admission price set at $2.
Quality of the dance will not be
effected by the price drop, for
Craig's Cardinals are expected to
supply a higher brand of dance
rhythm. And the site of the dance
itself, the Encina lobby, will be in
the best condition since the start of
its gradual deterioration back in the
days of the war.
What started out as a "renovating"
job has amounted to almost a com
plete remodeling and interior
building. The only recognizable fea
ture of the room is its size. Color,
structural finishing, and furnishing
are completely changed. Paint will
be dry enough by dance-time so
that the smell will have departed,
and only the spic 'n span appear
ance remain.
