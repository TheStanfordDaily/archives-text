# Bourbons Split Over Inflation, Bonus Plan
## Senate Okehs Bill To Give F.R. Silver Power 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 26 (/P) —
Congress, hitherto smoothly func
tioning on the Roosevelt program,
today brought new hazards to his
projected monetary legislation plans,
raising the bonus cash-payment is
sue in both Senate and House. With
other fresh delays preventing an in
flation vote today, Senator Robin
son offered bonus payment as an
amendment to the money program.
The same issue was raised in the
House by announcement of Repre
sentative Patman, of Texas, that b'-
had the votes to force a Democratic
party caucus on bonus paymeut by
next Monday, but that hp would
first consult with the party leaders
so as not to jam the machinery.
Glass Fights Plan
Eventual victory of the adminis
tration money bill was not believed
by Senate leaders to be threatened,
though Senator Glass, Virginia,
broke away today. He announced he
would vote against the bill because
he could not support the authoriza
tion for the President to devalorize
the dollar.
Distressed at Views
Conally, Texas, (hough doubting
maximum efficacy of the inflation
plan, stood for it squarely. Vanden
berg, Michigan, recorded himself for
all but the reduction of the dollar's
gold content. With it in, he felt he
must oppose the bill. Reed, Pennsyl
vania, captain of the opposition,
tangled with "Robinson of Arkansas,
the administration leader, in a sharp
exchange.
Once Glass joined the discussion
to express distress at Cunnally's
doubt that the Government was
morally bound to pay off its bond
holders in full gold value.
The Senate adopted the Wheeler-
King amendment authorizing the
President in his discretion to re
monetize silver at any ratio with
gold he deems necessary and for
unlimited free coinage of gold and
silver. The Senate then agreed to
limit debate on the administration
inflation plan after 2 p.m. tomorrow
