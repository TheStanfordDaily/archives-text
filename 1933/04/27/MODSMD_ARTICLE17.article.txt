# Laughter And Tears At Convalescent Home Told
## 
### BOB LETTS 
After talking about cauliflowers
and things on the bright, side of
the Convalescent Home, let's take a
look on the other side of the situa
tion and review a couple of cases (
that are being treated at present. |
Howard , a 6-year-old from
Santa Cruz, has been on the Farm
since last July. He is a victim of j
infantile paralysis and walks with a
bad limp. i
He's a cheerful, freckled-faced
little wart with a smile that, tells
you he doesn't realize the difficul
ties that face him. But that smile
may have another meaningâ€”one j
more subtle than you would expect
from a kid of his age. Howard may j
realize that the excellent treatment;
being given him by Head Nurse |

j Spande and her staff will nurture
him back to the point where his
growth will overcome physical dis- j
advantages and give him an even j
' break.
Miss Spande brought out a chart )
i kept in the Kate Dillon McLaugh- j
; lin Unit (a gift of Mary Crocker in j
1923) and showed how Howard has
; gained 15 pounds in the nine months j
he has been here.
I John , 5, who four months
ago was struck down by an auto- |
mobile has been paralyzed on |
one side ever since. He was given j
up for lost by San Francisco physi
j'cians until one of thein thought of
the Farm home. The result is that
John will return home after several ,
; more weeks and will be almost as ;
I good ns new.
