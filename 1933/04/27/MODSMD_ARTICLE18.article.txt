New Type Mystery
"Hawk Island," Stanford's first
mystery in four years, is a new type
of mysteiy drama, one in which
the conventional elements of murder
and mystery are completely re
versed. It. achieves the impossible in
that there is no detective and no
policeman in the entire pieceâ€”a fact
which augurs well for the suspense
element, which is carefully sustained
until the final drop of the curtain.
The play is under the direction of
Harold Helvenston, who is also de
signing the drama's single set. The
setting depicts the living-room of
the Hawk Island home of Gregqry
Sloane, wealthy bachelor.
Comedy Element
Concommitant with the murder
mystery element is a pronounced
quality of comedy, led by Bob
Churchill, who scored such a de
cisive hit in "Holiday." Churchill,
Chappie columnist and erstwhile
Rally Committee chairman, has a
uniquo brand of humor which he
injects into his current characteriza
tion of Paul Cooper.
Esther Pickering as his wife Har
riett is his partner in fun and prom
ises many laughs. Josephine Wilson
and Mary Anita Loos provide the
comedy as two guests of the house
party, and more subtle humor comes
from Pete Peck, Jack Lesley, and
Waldo Salt.
