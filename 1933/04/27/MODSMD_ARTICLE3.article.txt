PARIS, April 2(5 (/P)â€”The United
States has suggested to France and
Britain the creation of a huge world
credit pool to aid the return of a
normal flow of international trade,
it was reported in authoritative cir
cles here. No news of this offer has
appeared in the French press or in
reports from Washington published
here, the suggestion being in the
nature of a trial balloon.
