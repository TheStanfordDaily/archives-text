# Funny Magazine Gets Serious About a Deplorable Political Plot
## 
### 
NOW THAT Hie Chaparral, Stanford funny magazine,
lias developed and presented a thought concerning stu
dent polities and interest therein, the Daily sits hack and
waits for the Chappie brain-child to attain the full stature
of popularity. Kditorial writers who have been cheated
out of some of the standard entertainment for col lege
newspapermen through the blase attitude of Stanford stu
dents toward anything political take new hope at the sug
gestion of their humorous contemporary.
The Chaparral's Old Hoy, who has been knocking about
the campus long enough to recognize political chaff when
it is suffocating him, was not at all afield in recommending
a more genuine and less affected interest in student affairs
politic. Politics are almost as legitimate and as commonly
played a game as the student will encounter after college,
why should not the ('Diversity serve as a laboratory for
their instruction?
The time is rapidly approaching when students will
have the opportunity to vole again. For most of them the
occasion has usually been a mere opportunity, knocking
once, then again at the customary revotes. Hut if the non
voters, and those vast hordes of voters who cast their bal
lots on the basis of sports page publicity, could have the
experience which has been the Old Hoy's, they might flock
to the polls and put the right persons in otllce. That expe
rience lias been denied the majority of students, granted
only to the C.liap,pie's Ancient One, a few of his journalistic
tellows on the campus, the office-holders themselves, and
a sparse scattering of curious students. Those few, and
those few alone, know what goes on behind the student
executive committee, council, etc., doors. Only those privi
leged few realize the helpless inefficiency, the unoriginal
ily, the irresponsibility which so frequently characterize
student officers.
The Chappie suggests lh.it the political situation might
be improved through the regeneration of political ambi
tion and activity by a lew of the hoys at the top of the heap.
The Daii.v, concurring, still believes that the greatest im
provement can be made by the voters themselves, for a cer
tain number of unsuitable candidates will almost alwavs
be found listed on a long ballot.
