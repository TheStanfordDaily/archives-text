# Over-zealous Nazi Students Attempt to Burn Cultural History
## 
### 
Things have evidently gone pretty far in Germany,
when the news dispatches from the capital city of Herlin
tell of student Nazi enthusiasts confiscating and burning
volumes in their university libraries. It seems almost im
possible that a political movement with the far-reaching
radicalism of the present Hitler dictatorship could so com
pletely carry away a group of students. The Hitler regime,
whether good or bad for (lermanv, is certainly a radical
interlude, and the effect if has apparently had among col
lege men of the Fatherland is inexplicable from the Ameri
can point of view.
Not that it is inconceivable that students should riot in
a university library, but when they go to the extent of de
stroying books important historically, if no longer impor
tant economically, the German situation takes on a gro
tesque appearance.
Press wires say that the works of Karl Marx, princi
pally, are being consigned to the flames of Nazi wrath and
disapproval. Although the economic theories of the fa
mous German-Jew may have been completely antedated
throughout the world, Marx belongs to German culture
and its background, just as he belongs to world culture.
Any such act as the burning of his writings is contrary to
the most fundamental principles of cultural education,
which must rely upon Ihe richness of past experience, and
the German university system is merely detracting from
its efficiency and cflieacy by destroying his contributions
to social life.
Surely Ibis latest over-zealous, unthinking perpetration
of the Nazi student element has been the work of German
freshmen, or junior college transfers, if there are such in
dividuals in the German school svstem.
