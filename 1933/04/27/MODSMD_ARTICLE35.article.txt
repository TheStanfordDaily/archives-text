# BULL SESSION
## AND THUS IT ENDETH 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
There was a Bookstore and there
was an Investigation—but that was
many years ago in a kingdom by
the Bay. And the Investigators were
hopeful—but that also was many
years ago. The Investigators thought
someone might give them an ear—
or two—but then they were young
in that Kingdom by the Bay.
So they prepared a document,
ihese Investigators did, with recom
mendations simple and bold. But
while figures and facts were studied,
"policies" were not—and therein lie
their error and therefore were they
punished—unlo the fourth genera
tion—yea verily it was written. It.
was thought in that time (many
years ago) that the manner to lower
the expenses was to lower them; '
but that was error—so it was writ
ten.
It was declared that policies shall
prevail and so shall expenses. That,
despite the fact that it was a Jean
year and despite the fact that Jo
sephs in Economics had prophesied
many lean years to come. And some
of the bolder asked: "Why must the
policies prevail: "The policies have
been established; that is enough."
And that was enough, for the people
saw—only too clearly; but the
Bookstore cared not, for they hadeth
the "say"—the last "say."
Then the people gathered in the

. squares and on the circles and spoke
i —lacking anything better to do.
I Queried they: "Perhaps, the Inves
tigators are in error in their new
proposals?" That was possible espe
cially since all erroreth in those
days except Drol (who was their
god) £.nd the Bookstore. But still,
said the people, "We received not
j our rebates neither do we profit."
Perhaps the Bookstore itseif will
devise means to bring rebates out
of a most lucrative business, thought
the people. For they reasoned in
their primitive way (as they did in
those days many years ago), we
. careth not for methods; we want re
| bates. We will wait and see. But
| the drought continued and there
' was but little in the rebate bucket
for as all but the blindest could see
—the bucket was pierced with holes.
Then the people rose in their
wrath and cried: "The Bookstore has
applied the Imperial Ding to the In
vestigators yet nothing better have
they given us. We perish, for, in
faith, we have no rebates." Then
they called for their Investigators
but the Investigators heard not.
They were peacefully slumbering in
the quiet of their beer gardens. So
it Is written.
But things like these could only
happen in thase far-off days of an
t tiquity in that Kingdom by the Bay.
