THE TRIAL OF EURIPIDES —
Presented in the Greek Theatre at
Berkeley, April 21, by the Eng
lish Club of the University of
California.
The Thesmophoriazusae is not one
of Aristophanes' best plays, but with
ingenious staging it can become a
ridiculous and laughable farce. The
Greek Theatre performance suc
ceeded admirably in this respect,
with the additional virtue of being
an impressive pageant of color,
music, and dancing.
The play is practically plotless, the
single situation concerned with the
masquerade of Euripides' father-in
law as a woman to plead the play
wright's cause at a court of in
sulted Athenian women. The ex
tremely modern adaptation squeezed
all the possible fun out of this com
plication, losing little of Aristo
phanes' traditionally rough wit. Ac
centuating the satire of Euripidean
tragedy by broad and often slap
stick comedy, it achieved an ap
propriate madness as it progressed.
Everett Glass, the director, de
serves the majority of plaudits for a
smooth, finished production. He
made use of every resource of the

outdoor theatre to gain a Grecian
quality for the mock solemnity of
the outraged women. His staging,
aside from a few unfortunate
groupings, were artistic and always
sane.
John Grover as Mensilochus and
Nestor Paiva as Euripides wei-e out
standing in the lengthy cast for their
skillful use of voice and pantomime.
Howard Banks as the effeminate
poet, Agathon, made much of a
brief appearance.
The original music was adequate
if undistinguished, while a number
of the dances would have benefited
by further rehearsal. Effectively de
signed masks worn by the actors
made more archaic their ludicrous
modernism. —Broughton
