In the light of National Apple
Week, National Fire Prevention
Week, Mother's Day, Be-Kind-to-
Animals Week, and the probably
amminent legalization of Birth Con
trol Week, I think it not at all con
ceited to donate this column today
to Apology Day.
First, I wish to apologize to Paul
Targhetta, Phil Johnston, rind Jerry
Trautman from omitting them from
the group of Stanford athletes who
have won both a Block and Circle
"S." Targhetta is a football and
boxing letterman; Johnston has
awards similar to the red-bead's;
and Trautman earned himself a
Block in baseball and a Circle in
golf in his sophomore year.
ARBUCKI,E BEATEN BY
INCHES IN JAVELIN
Second, I must humbly beg Ernie
Arbuckle to forgive me for stating
that Dave Brown, not Ernie, was
Jourth in the javelin S.C.
Arbuckle was iri third place until
Williamson's hist throw, which best
ed Ernie's best by inches. The Stan
ford man may very conceivably be
able to outspear Williamson in the
return meet.
Third, Helen Jacobs, Sammy
Lee, and Norm Clcavcland all fig
ure in an apology concerning that
Jacobs-Lee "exhibition" tennis
match. In spite of my statement.
Miss Jacobs was not dispensed
with playing before an unexpected
crowd; on the contrary, she was
ruffled (and only slightly at that)
because she has pilt milk on her
dress at lunch and was thefore not
garbed for publicity.
Fourth, 1 must apologize to you all
for allowing Harry Hayward of the
San Francisco Examiner to scoop
me with the news that six marks
in the Stanford-U.S.C. meet Satur
day exceeded last year's 1.C.4-A.
winning times, distances, and
heights. On a scientific basis of mark
comparisons, Hayward found that
Stanford's performances Saturday
would have scored 53 points in the
1932 1.C.4-A.'s (without Eastman)
and that S.C. would have tallied 32
digits.
SUNNY CALIFORNIA PRODUCES
SUNNY TRACKMEN
For those of you who love their
statistics, here are comparisons be
tween Saturday's dual meet and the
Kansas Relays held the same day.
1 need hardly mention that the
comparison is California-colored.
The Minnesota track captain,
Charles Schoifiy, won the highs at
Kansas in 15-flat while Gus Meier
and Bob Lyon ran against the wind
in 14.9. And a Kansas sophomore
named Ed Hall ran a 10-llat. century
1o beat Glass of Oklahoma Aggies
and Meyer of Texas, among others.
Les Hables' time against Ball, Par
sons, and Lombardi was 9.7.
Someone named Kamm, from
Illinois, threw the shot the colossal
winning distancse of 47 feet 6' 2
inches, which startling heave was
more than two feet less than Nel
lie Gray's put-tliat-did-not-place.
And it was over four feet less
than Dunn's and Lyman's winning
throws.
Here Laborde's 162-foot, 7-inch
discus throw was feet better
than the winner's toss* at Kansas;
Bill Grabet's winning vault exceed
ed the Kansas mark by almost six
inches; and four (perhaps five: I do
not know Brown's mark) javelin
throwers at the Stanford-S.C. meet
would have beaten the paltry 184
feet 2% inches made back East in
the Middlewest.
In only two of the events held
at both meets were the Relays'
marks superior. The broad-jump
was won at 24 feet. inches with
24 feet, 'a inch second. And the
mile relay went to Indiana's quar
tet in 3:17.2, which is considerably
better than S.C., without Tomp
kins and Warburton or much in
centive or competition to drive
them on, were able to negotiate
the distance.
All of which means that, in every
thing except the distances, Dink
Templeton and Dean Cromwell can
defy the world of track.

A survey in an eastern university
revealed that sixty per cent of its
students sleep through at least three
hours of classes each week.
