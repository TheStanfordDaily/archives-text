# Law Goes With Coughlin, Lee, To Ojai Tournament
## 
### 
John Law, frosh tennis captain,
and promising Card player, yester
day left for Ojai to compete in the
Ojai open tennis tournament.
His going was a last-moment de
cision, and he will not compete in
the Intercollegiate Division, for
which he is ineligible, until next sea
son.
Sam Lee and Joe Coughlin will
play in both the singles and team
up in the doubles, while in the open
tourney Law will have plenty of
competition against many of the
Souths best players. Keith Gledhill,
last year's Card varsity captain, will
probably be playing in the open di
vision.
This experience will help season
Law into a formidable player for
next year's team, for his main weak
ness this year was inexperience.
