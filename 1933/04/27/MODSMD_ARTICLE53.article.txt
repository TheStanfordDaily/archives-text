# SIM, HAMILTON AND GRAYSON STAR IN INITIAL SCRIMMAGE
## 
### Oliver Johnston, Jr 
A good handful of spectators
turned out last night to form their
opinions on what they think the In
dians will do next year. They were
rewarded with a scrimmage which
featured long run-backs of punts
and some nice open field running
from the scrimmage line.
The first and third teams started
off the affair with neither holding
any particular advantage. Bill Sim,
aided by the excellent blocking of
Bones Hamilton, was the only one
of the outfit that could gain con
sistently.
Sim ripped off severaK good gains
through tackle, and as usual he car
ried along several wouldbe tacklers
for most of the distance of his gain.
AlTlerbaugh Stars
Kenny Afflerbaugh kept the first
team out of danger with his nice
long twisting spirals. Afflerbaugh
and Reisner both looked good at
the safety position.
The only two touchdowns of the
afternoon were scored by the sec
ond team while playing against
the fourth string. Both scores came
as a result of long runs by Gray
son.
The first was scored by Van Dellen
after Grayson had carried the ball
to the ten-yard line on a 45-yard
dash. The second one Grayson made
single-handed on a 35-yard run in
which he reversed his field several
times and finally outran the defense.
Bob Baentz looked to be very
much improved over last year. He
gained consistently and got off one
nice run of 30 yards.
In the line Moscrip and Norgard
were constantly smearing up the
opposing plays. The way Adams
and Rouble played against Corbus
and Kite makes it fook as if there
were going to be a lot of compe
tition for the guard jobs. O'Con
nor also showed up well at guard.
I Contrary to previous statements,
Stanford will not enter any of its
gridmen in the Field Day at Baxter
Stadium in Stockton next Saturday.
Alonzo Stagg will preside at the
meet which is being held under the
auspices of the College of the Pacific.
