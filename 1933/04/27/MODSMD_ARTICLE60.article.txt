# S.C. Football Teams To Play Charity Game
## 
### 
Southern California's track and
field team may occasionally take one
on the beagle, but the Trojan foot
ball squad admits no such failing.
In fact, the Southerners became so
tired of steaming through, under,
around, and over all opposition last
fall, that their only present resource
is to play among themselves.
Which all leads up to the fact that
the Trojan first and second teams
will tangle in a full-time charity
game next Saturday in the Olympic
Stadium, with proceeds of the af
fair going to the Ked Cross earth
quake fund.
Cnaeh Howard Jones will get liis
first good estimate of l!)X> Trojan
grid power when his charges start
whipping around in this encounter
which will climax the S.C. spring
practice session.
For his first string, Jones will be
able to start his customary power
house crew. None other than Cap
tain Ford Palmer will open at end,
while Ward Browning teams with
him. Lady and Erskine replace the
famous pair of tackles, Brown and
Smith; the durable duo of Rosen
berg and Stevi ns operate at guards,
and Johnny Dye takes center in the
absence of Curt Youel, last year's

Homer Griffith gyrates at quarter,
with Gordie Clark at full, and Mc-
Neish and Bright at halves.
