Tonight in the; Assembly Hall at

ston's cast of thirteen experienced
players will enact the sophisticated
murder mystery play by Howard
Irving Young, "Hawk Island."
Characterized by its author as a
"drama of the night," the play con
tains a variety of elements and in
cidents, knit together in a skillful
manner. The entire action takes
place on Hawk Island, the property
of Gregory Sloane, host to a group
of friends, one of whom meets hit
death on the isolated island.
Sloane Is Host
Sloane is the perfect host, charm
ing and likeable, and it i.s his at
tempt to provide entertainment for
his guests that gives impetus to the
events which take place.
Madeline Austen is one of the
guests, charming and sophisticated,
and married to Tom Austen, a dy
namic and interesting character.
The fact that he is married and
expects his wife to appear on Hawk
Island the following day does not
prevent Donald Parish from being
quite in love with Madeline Austen.
Comedy, Romance
Paul Cooper, the wisecracker, and
his wife Harriett inject not a little
comedy into the proceedings, while
Sally Rogers provides the romantic
element. Among others present are
Stella Wayne, thrice married and
proud of it; Louise Hoi lister, a some
what jumpy and wholly enthusiastic
person; and Anthony Bryce, a suc
cessful author of mysteries. In the
background are Barker, the butler;
