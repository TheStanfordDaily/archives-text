run on a 100-yard track.
At the quarter-mile distance there
! will be a heel-and-toe contest. An
obstacle race will be the attraction
at seven hundred yards. Ordinary
bicycles, with racing wheels barred,
are scheduled for two laps around
the oval. Weight men have a special
50-yard dash —if they can get under
way at that short distance. Lyman
will not enter. A sprinter in his
high-school days, he is out of the
100-per-cent weight-man class.
Prizes Donated
; In keeping \vith their announced
i plan, the committee is not revealing
! which prize will be put up for which
race, although a definite selection
i will be pre-arranged. This should
1 add an element of extra interest to
' the entrants.
Donations include: a special Ko
dak (Kenyon's), a Knox hat (Phelps-
Terkel), fitted case (Roos Bros.),
, electric clock (Baker's), Varsity Ox
ford shirt (Widcman's), desk pen
(Thurlow's), pigskin wallet (Cul
j ver's).
Students desiring to participate

MEMBERS of Stanford's Trojan-vanquishing IM3 track and field squad
will make their last northern California appearance at 3 o'clock this
afternoon when the Irish Marathon gets under way at Angell Field.
Les Hahles, much-nicknamed Indian speedster, has promised to be on
hand for the special century race. Lombardi and Rice, his teammates,
will be there to furnish competition.
Addition of a shuttle football relay was made to the list of events late
yesterday. Four men from each class will race back and forth in front ol"
the stands, shoving the pigskin to a fellow-classman at the end of each

100 yards. The freshmen are favored
to win by virtue of the sprinter
gridmen Grayson, Rcisner, Moscrip,
and Bronstein.
The traditional Irish Marathon
itself will see two dozen men from
each class run one lap each. The
process will take almost half an
hour, and at the conclusion the
Quadrangle Club will present the
runner of the fastest lap with a
medal.
