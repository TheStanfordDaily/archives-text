## Shaw Tells Effect Of Gold Standard 
### 
Going of! the gold standard on the
part oi the United States will have
a temporary favorable effect on in
dustry in so far as it will cause an
increase and expansion in bank
credit, and thus raise the purchas
ing power of the country, according
to Edward S. Shaw, Stanford in
structor in economics, who spoke
last night at a meeting of the League
for Industrial Democracy.
"This would not have been
possible if the United States had
insisted that gold always remain
interchangeable with the means of
payment at a fixed rate," he stated.
"The one objection that could be
levied against the U.S. is that 110
attempt was made to see that those
countries having little gold should
get any of it."
The general situation of the pea
pickers who are striking in Ala
meda County was summed up at
the meeting by Arthur McEwen, a
Stanford student who visited the
region last week. The essential rea
son for the strike was said to be
starvation wages which are about 15
cents an hour, while the workers are
holding out for 30 cents an hour.
