# Fairy Tales Come True For Tiny Convalescents
## 
### ELLAMAE DODDS 
Brrrrrr. An insisted ring on the
doorbell of a small cream-colored
stucco house, and the visitor was
admitted by a smiling little hostess
all dressed up in her Sunday best.
And as the visitor stepped through
the miniature doorway, it seemed to
her as though fairy stories did come
true, at least for the kiddies of the
Stanford Convalescent Home.
Inside the redwood-panelled liv
j ing-room fifteen happy youngsters
| were having afternoon tea, grouped
i around a cheery fireplace and cush
i ioned window-seats, and seated on
I small wicker chairs, just the right
1 size for the little guests.
The little-girl hostess served her
unexpected caller from a miniature

tea-set, and, pleased when the visi
tor expressed her admiration for the
homey little cottage, proudly showed
her the other rooms. A glimpse into
the tiny kitchen revealed an alluring
display of proper-sized dishes, pots
and pan ,and a small sink with water
faucets placed where children could
reach them. On the other side of the
living-room a small sun-porch fur
nished in wicker provided an en
chanted play place and a home for
a large doll family.
This fairlyland for convalescing
youngsters is kntrtvn as the "Ruth
Cottage" and has been their very
own for a happy year. It was
made possible by a donation from
Mrs. Sigmund Stern of Palo Alto.
