# Paly Vote Seen As Court Rules 3.2 Beer Illegal
## Judge Syer Denies Plea For Habeas Corpus 
### Jay Graves 
With Attorneys Adron Beene
and Ed Fellows making ready for
a possible appeal from Judge R. E.
Syer'.; decision against the sale of
3.2 beer, Palo Alto backers of the
congressional brew yesterday lost
the second round of their battle to
make beer "legal" in the University
town.
Superior Judge Syer discharged
the habeas corpus seeking the re
lease of Harry Brady, charged
with the sale of 3.2 beer in Palo
Alto in violation of city ordinances.
This, in effect, rules beer illegal
in Palo Alto.
Attorney Beene, although uncer
tain as to just what his next step
will be, indicated that he might seek
an appeal from Judge Syer's deci
sion, in his effort to legalize beer in
Palo Alto.
Petition List Grows
Meanwhile, the list of signatures
on the petition asking the council
to hold a special election end to
allow the citizens to vote on whether
or not beer shall be legal in Palo
Alto continued to grow. Today it
approached Ihe 700 mark, as its en
thusiastic backers prepared it for a
probable presentation before the
city council when that body meets
next Monday night.
Both sides are agreed that the
final battle over the legality of the
brew will be a vote of the people
in a special election.
In yesterday's trial Attorney Beene
based his plea for the upholding of
the writ on "statutory construc
tion." He declared that the true in
terpretation of the words "alco
holic liquor," which appear in the
charter must be "intoxicating alco
holic liquor."
Won First Round
Beene pointed out that in the first
round of the battle the local police
court held that "near beer," contain
ing one-half of one per cent alcohol
was not "alcoholic." Beene also
cited the action of Congress in de
claring the new brew to be "non
intoxicating."
Arnold Ruinwell, Palo Alto city
attorney, retaliated by holding
that the court was "not concerned
with the act of Congress but with
the reading of the charter of the
city of Palo Alto." The court
agreed with this. Judge Syer also
believed that the word "intoxicat
ing" could not be read into the
city charter.
Regarding the reversionary clause
in the Palo Alto property deeds,
Beene pointed out that they pro
hibited the sale of "intoxicating li
quors" and not "alcoholic liquors.'
Hence the University attorneys were
not actively interested in yesterday's
action.
