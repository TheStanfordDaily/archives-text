Mystery, comedy, chills, wild chuckles- Iho Assembly
I hill slago becomes "llawk Island" lonighl, us the curtains
pari on I lie one and only dramatic presentation of the
present quarter, the last ( I the present school year.
Produced for the tirst time in this country, tonight's
mvstery-comedy is the lirsl play of its type to he ottered
en the SPanford hoards in the past four years, and it
lullills a request often voiced by many campus dramatic
patrons. Not only does the "I lawk Island" play round out
the varied si age program of the season, it appears to be
the solution to the economic problem laced bv the Dra
matic. Council.
Willi a deficit hanging over from former plays pre
sented this year, Iho Dramatic ouncil has chosen wisely a
mystery drama as the best bet to tack a happy ending onto
an otherwise unfortunate financial year. There was con
siderable opposition from one source and another to the
production of any drama this quarter. For that reason,
Stanford dramatics are, in a sense, on trial tonight. With
a play Ihat is sure fire, with a cast and director who have
given their best to a line vehicle, a financial failure tonight
can mean nothing but the decadence of drama on the
Stanford campus, with student apathy as the cause.
