# Campus Roads in Need of Improvementâ€”But Not of This Sort

### 
II the Stanford campus were noted for nothing else it
would still stand in a class by itself as the possessor of one
of the bumpiest yoad systems in the state.
f here is not one street on the campus that has not un
limited room lor improvement. Of course, improvements
cost money and these are times of depression, but, accord
ing to the old-timers, the roads have been in the identical
condition for the past seven or eight years.
One exception must be noted: The road which runs out
past Lagunita and the golf course has been "improved"
within the past lew months. At least so the authorities
have announced.
'I he "improvement" consists chiefly invmorc bumps and
a very distinct addition of danger to an already unsafe
thoroughfare. Through a process of widening, dirt shoul
ders have been added to both side of the pavement which
has become covered with loose gravel.
The shoulders are too rough for use and the pavement
is 100 narrow lor safety. I nlilled ditches crossing the road
at regular intervals add to the "improvement."
If this is local conception of improvement, we can only
hope that the remaining campus roads arc left as thev are.
