## TO THE HIGHER AND THE FINER 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
There is beauty in life and the i
beauty of it all makes a big im
pression on me about Friday. It has
been thus since grammar school
days when Friday was the herald of
the movie on Saturday afternoon,
the advance agent, of the "colored
comics" of Sunday, and all the
thinks that made week-ends worth
while. That was of course before I
had three classes on Saturday, but
(hat early joy-in-living that Friday
engendered has ever remained with
me despite it all.
Thus it is that today the evils of
the world melt into sunshine and
cherry cokes. We drop the barbed
lance of fearless journalism, forsake
the raw truth for truth's sake. To
day shall be the day for fond strok
ing and sincere praise. And never
has one Campus week-end been .so
I'tSll of worthwhile enterprises.
Of course there is "Hawk Island"
tonight. For once it looks as if it
will not be necessary to say: "You
support this play or ELSE some
thing terrible will happen to Stan
ford dramatics." For while this is
as true as ever, it looks for once
that the campus is dramatic-minded.
The campus resistance to campus
dramatics has been broken down by
a mystery drammer. It may not be
beautiful, but it's collegiate life—
give 'em simple stuff; they love it. I
surely hope the balcony doesn't fall
down.
A simple play with primitive ap- i

'peal—humor and mystery—plus aj
dash of sophistication is "Hawk Is
land." Then, by chance or box-office
aforethought, the play collects a 1
bevy (small bevy) of beautiful wo- j
men and campus big-.shots. Sure- j
fire.
Then there is the Irish Marathon
this afternoon—3 o'clock. Good
wholesome fun is the Marathon, and
only 25 cents —a gift. It may be a I
perversion to want to see other
people in an embarrassing position,
but that's what the Marathon will
offer. Big, beefy weight stars trying
to run a dash. Will somebody's face j
be red? Mine for one —-from laugh- !
ing. Come and give 'em the laugh.
It's for a good cause. Other humor
ous specialties as well.
Time marches on (fanfare, fan- !
fare). Saturday night is the Conva- '
I lescent Home Dance in the Women's
Gym. The dance must be good; they |
have adopted an idea first suggested
by the Bull Session. Roughs will be '
allowed in—but at the same price j
as couples. Too long have those who |
dragged wenches to the dance been
penalized. But, on the other hand,
it's worth 75 cents to have Ihc pick
!of the campus at no inconvenience. |
There also is a library on the
Campus—about 100 yards down from
the Post Office on the right-hand
side of Lasuen as you dash off the
Campus for a cool glass of beer at
Menlo. As far as I know, it will
I open as usual at 2 P.M. Sunday.
