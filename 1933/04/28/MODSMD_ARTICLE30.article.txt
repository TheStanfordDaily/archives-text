TIIE NEW MUSIC SOCIETY—AII-
American Program (At the Cen
tury Club, San Francisco, April
25).
The New Music Society is headed
by Henry Cowell, publisher of New
Music magazine and one of the
country's leading exponents of con
temporary music, especially that ot'
a more unconventional nature. Quite
in keeping with the tone of the So
ciety, its All-American program was
radical in the extreme. As the gen
tleman who announced the program 1
aptly put it, occasionally "some
harmony accidentally crept in."
It would be foolhardy to attempt
a definite evaluation of this unfa
miliar music at first hearing. It was,
however, exceptionally interesting
and thought-provoking. Since there
are many signs that music is moving
in the direction of these advanced
idioms, the serious student should
therefore familiarize himself with :
them. A society that makes it pos
sible to hear these works is to bo
highly commended.
The overwhelming success of the
evening was Louis Gruenberg's
"The Daniel Jazz," for soprano and
chamber orchestra, with Vachel
Lindsey's poem, "Daniel," as its text.
The excellent performance by Edith '

i Benjamin Soule was so enthusiasti
cally received that the work was
repeated. This music, an attempt to j
combine jazz with the classic Euro
pean form of composition, is so |
vigorous and robust that it has a
decidedly stimulating effect upon
Lhe audience. It clearly points the

| way to Mr. Gruenberg's recent
operatic success, "The Emperor
Jones."
Gerald Strang, Stanford '28. con
ducted his "Quintet for Clarinet and
Strings." One of the most radical
works on the program, it suffered
from a complete lack of melody, as
it is ordinarily understood, but ex
hibited some ingenious tonal com

binations of the instruments used.
The program also included four
impressive songs by Charles Ives,
some piano variations on a Beetho
ven theme by Aaron Copland, and
compositions by Wallingford Rieg
ger and Adolph Weiss. The perform
ances were on the whole unusually
capable (especially in consideration
of the difficulty of this type of

music) and sympathetic, which add
ed much to their effectiveness.
