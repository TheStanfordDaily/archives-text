The big bass boom of an unabash
able barker rose above the stirring
crowd to smite the leaden, Bay
moi.stened air with wild words of
worldly wisdom.
"Ladee;; and gentlemen," he
roared, "ladees and gentlemen.
Come one. come all: step right up

moaning down the little black
straightaway. Step right up, ladees
and gentlemen and Stanford roughs.
Step right up, and see this awesome,
hair-raising demonstration for only
25 cents; one quartah of a dollah; the
price of but two packages of cigar
r ties or Old Golds.
"Step right up, ladees and gentle
men and Roble maidens, and watch
the football boys run. Watch them
run in full attiah: in cleated shoes
and padded pants and shimmels and
gi'eal gray sweat-suits. Watch them

Football Relay. It is the eighth,
ninth, and tenth wonders of the
world, ladees and gentlemen ,and
all those wonders have hitherto been
hidden from the public eye. See the
football boys run, ladees and gentle
men; see them run and pass a foot
ball to others of their ilk.
"Airl that is not all, my friends.
For the price of admission —for only
25 cents, one-eighth of two dollahs,
you can sec human crabs negotiate
100 yahds backwards; you can see
two men with three legs trip and
fall as they race onward in the
three-legged sprint; you can see
long-striding traeksters put heel to
toe in a thrilling, novel, never-bc
fore-witnessed method of running;
you can the greatest dashers of
the Farm running 100 yahds against
themselves. Obstacle races; bicycle
races; 24 laps of speedy quartah
miling by fat lads out of condition —
all this, ladees and gentlemen, a
ten-spot's worth of fun and frolic,
for only 25 cents."
And then the big, brave, boom
ing man paused for breath. When
he again continued, the crowd,
that had grown to several bun

"There is, somewhere in California,
in a quiet, penetrating tone now,
