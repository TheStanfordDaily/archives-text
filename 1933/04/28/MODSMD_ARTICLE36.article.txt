# Tankmen To Meet Galileo
## 
### 
The Galileo High School swim
ming team, San Francisco prep
champions, will arrive at the Encina
pool tomorrow to give the Stanford
babes their first real competition of
the quarter. The meet starts at 4
o'clock.
The Stanford team will make a
strong bid to continue its current
streak of victories which has been
sustained through the highly touted
California freshmen and the Menlo
J.C. pool men.
The Papoose starts who have shown
especially capable in past meets are
, Captain Kenneth Livingston, De
Meyers, and Jack Begman. Living
ston set a new Little Big Meet rec
ord this year and was the high-point
man in the Menlo meet.
As with the majority of meets at
the Encina pools, women will be
excluded.

out searching."â€”Francis Bacon.
