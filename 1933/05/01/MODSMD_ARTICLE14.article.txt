# Play Choice Unfortunate; Cast Strong
## Churchill, Collins, And Crary Excel 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
"Anything might happen 011
Hawk Island."
And anything might happen
when the Ex Committee steps in
and chooses a play, a mystery
play, to satisfy what is technically
known as "the popular taste."
What happened was the presenta
tion, last Friday, of a very unfor
tunate play dubbed "Hawk Island,"
which completely belied all the
hopeful advance notices. Based on
£• fundamentally unconvincing idea,
the play lacks coherence, which even
the efforts of a well-balanced cast
could not impart to it.
Like Milne Play
Like Milne's "Perfect Alibi" (u far
better treatment of a similar theme),
(he play permits the audience to
witness the- murder and watch the
characters solve it. Thus we see
them jumping at all sorts of silly
conclusions and solving the murder
in less time than it took to perform
it.
The cast did all they could with a
very limp opus and failed to bolster
it up. Helvenston's direction built
smoothly, after a slow first act, to
the climactic scene between Tom
and Madeline in Act 111. The single
setting was excellent, and the dif
ficult offstage noises well-handled.
"Hawk Island" is not a play of
star parts, but in the Stanford ver
sion three players stood out: Bar
bara Collins, Paul Crary, and 801 l
Churchill.
Crary's role was the most difficult
i —an unpleasant and exacting char
acter—and he handled it excellently.
There was some unevenness about
his Tom Austen but he made up for
this by good work at the close of
Act II and in the third act scene
with Barbara Collins.
Collins Poised
Miss Collins was, as usual, the
most poised member of the cast, in a
difficult and thankless part—one
which might have been slightly lu
dicrous in the emotional sequences
had the actress not turned it into a
memorable piece of work.
Churchill, than whom there is no
one more naturally funny, was
simply Churchill—which is funny
enough for any audience. His Paul
Cooper was colored by his own
brand of humor, and he garnered a
maximum of laughs.
One of the most finished per
formances in the play was that of
Waldo Salt as Barker; in voice,
dignity, and comedy he was out
standing. Poise and charm marked
the work of John Peckham, who
died wonderfully.
Harriet Bellamy's Sally was pleas
ing to the eye, but her voice im
pressed as immature. Esther Picker
ing gained many laughs from an
exaggerated characterization of Har
riett Cooper, while Mary Anita Loos
drew some comedy from a micro
scopic part.
Jack Lesley deserves commenda
tion for his fine poise, and Bob Bal
zar for a consistent characterization.
Josephine Wilson and Richard Clai'e
were effective in minor roles.

Like Milne's "Perfect Alibi" (u far
better treatment of a similar theme),
(he play permits the audience to
witness the- murder and watch the
characters solve it. Thus we see
them jumping at all sorts of silly
conclusions and solving the murder
in less time than it took to perform
it.
The cast did all they could with a
very limp opus and failed to bolster
it up. Helvenston's direction built
smoothly, after a slow first act, to
the climactic scene between Tom
and Madeline in Act 111. The single
setting was excellent, and the dif
ficult offstage noises well-handled.
"Hawk Island" is not a play of
star parts, but in the Stanford ver
sion three players stood out: Bar
bara Collins, Paul Crary, and 801 l
Churchill.
Crary's role was the most difficult
i —an unpleasant and exacting char
acter—and he handled it excellently.
There was some unevenness about
his Tom Austen but he made up for
this by good work at the close of
Act II and in the third act scene
with Barbara Collins.
Collins Poised
Miss Collins was, as usual, the
most poised member of the cast, in a
difficult and thankless part—one
which might have been slightly lu
dicrous in the emotional sequences
had the actress not turned it into a
memorable piece of work.
Churchill, than whom there is no
one more naturally funny, was
simply Churchill—which is funny
enough for any audience. His Paul
Cooper was colored by his own
brand of humor, and he garnered a
maximum of laughs.
One of the most finished per
formances in the play was that of
Waldo Salt as Barker; in voice,
dignity, and comedy he was out
standing. Poise and charm marked
the work of John Peckham, who
died wonderfully.
Harriet Bellamy's Sally was pleas
ing to the eye, but her voice im
pressed as immature. Esther Picker
ing gained many laughs from an
exaggerated characterization of Har
riett Cooper, while Mary Anita Loos
drew some comedy from a micro
scopic part.
Jack Lesley deserves commenda
tion for his fine poise, and Bob Bal
zar for a consistent characterization.
Josephine Wilson and Richard Clai'e
were effective in minor roles.
"Anything might happen 011
Hawk Island."
And anything might happen
when the Ex Committee steps in
and chooses a play, a mystery
play, to satisfy what is technically
known as "the popular taste."
What happened was the presenta
tion, last Friday, of a very unfor
tunate play dubbed "Hawk Island,"
which completely belied all the
hopeful advance notices. Based on
£• fundamentally unconvincing idea,
the play lacks coherence, which even
the efforts of a well-balanced cast
could not impart to it.
