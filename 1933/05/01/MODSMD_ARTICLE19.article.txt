# Salary Cut To Start In May
## Faculty Members Receive 10 Per Cent Slash 
### 
Largely as the result of decreased
! registration this year, with conse
quent loss of revenue, and the pres
sure on University funds to meet
the demands for tuition notes by
students who otherwise would be
! unable to continue their courses, the
1
j administration has found it neces
j sary to reduce professors's salaries
; by ten per cent for the last four
I months of the current year.
j The faculty had already been no
| tilied that salaries of $1000 and more
j would be reduced by this percentage
j for next year; now President Wil-
I bur has sent word to them that a
careful study of the University
budget, with registration figures for
the spring quarter in hand, shows a
prospective deficit of considerable
size ,forcing salary reductions at an
earlier date than was at first, con
templated. It had been hoped to
avoid them this year.
In his letter to the members of
the teaching staff whose salaries
range above the $1000 level and will
therefore be cut beginning with
May, President Wilbur says that in
spite of all possible economies in
: addition to those already undertaken
leave the budget still in such con
edition that the professors must be
I asked to accept the reduction. He
points out also that practically all
| the universities outside metropolitan
] centers have had the same' experi
! ence as Stanford.
