asks the support of every student.
" I liis year more than ever," says General Chairman
Chuck Otis, "the llome needs the donations of students.
Seventy sick or crippled children ask the campus' aid that
they may continue to have Ihe medical and denial care,
the schooling, Ihe psychological attention, and ahove all
the sunlight and fresh air that will make worth-while
American citizens of these children."
Seventy little patients are now housed in the Home's
various units. For their own welfare, and for the self
respect of the campus, they should he kept there. A failure
on Ihe part of Ihe students will deprive some of these
youngsters of the care they must have.
Their ease is even more deserving of financial aid than
those of Ihe Farm's students who find that the vear I!KW
has not been fortunate for their own pockcthooks, for the
children have neither the past opportunities nor the future
possibilities to aid them.
There is undoubtedly no Stanford student whose own
circumstances are so hard pressed that lie cannot afford to
contribute something to this cause.
Stanford's own charity asks your support; seventy chil
dren ask food and sunlight to heal crippled limbs and
