# Old Motto of College "Spirit" Forgotten by Stanford Graduates
## 
### 
I lie spirit of "I'd die for dear old Rutgers" implies, to
the man w ho spent his years between (lie ages of eighteen
and twcntv-lwo working, a never-dying allegiance which
the college man has for his alma mater. To some of the
college graduates the familiar Rutgers quotation means
almost the same thing. This long-lived college "spirit" is
no myth, at many large Kastern universities. The old grads
die in droves, and leave huge sums to (lie New England
seals ol their higher education. The younger grads feel
the same sense of gratitude toward their degree donor.
When their university extends the palm, they comply, for
ever swelling "improvement funds" or "foundations" of
one variety or another.
Where does the Rutgers saw fit into the Stanford pic
lure? On the gridiron and other sporting fields, perhaps.
Rut what becomes of the college "spirit" among Stanford
graduates? It Hares occasionally on Rig Game days and
other gala occasions, when the portly gentlemen of earlier
classes return sentimentally to the scenes of their youthful
escapades. Rut it is no secret that Stanford is forgotten
with surprising regularity when the graduates reach the
mood in which thousands are given to "worthy causes."
It is no secret thai Stanford graduates do not love their
university, not with the love which speaks in dollars, at
any rate.
Why should Stanford men, educated in as pleasant a
spot as could be found and benefited financially by that
education more than the average college man, not contrib
ute more generously to their I'Diversity's upkeep and ex
pansion? That is a question which must he answered, not
by the graduates, but by the I Diversity. If Stanford does
not turn out men who really love their alma mater, then
the I niversitv itself is at fault.
