# BULL SESSION
## EVERYTHING FOR EVERYBODY 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
George Washington and the "boys"
of 1776 started it and we have been
paying for it ever since. Now demo
cracy is a fine thing. It is desirable
that all should be equal before the
law —in theory at least. In practice,
however, we must always remember
that the late Senator Walsh's state
ment, "You can't convict a million
dollars in the United States," is still
the living gospel.
But because everyone has a vote
and equality before the Jaw the mob
immediately assumes that equality is
trumps and everyone is entitled to
13 of them. The latest manifestation
><l' this old superstition is the move
in the? Legislature to establish seven
more state colleges in California—to
bring higher education to the "pea
pull." This is to be realized by wav
ing the golden wand of added ap
propriations over seven teacher
training schools—misnamed teachers'
colleges.
If this little scheme is pushed
through, we will have even more
college graduates looking for jobs
than we have now. It will soon be
necessary to hold a Ph.D. to get a
service-station job; an A.B. will no
longer be sufficient. For if these
seven colleges are to continue to
suck funds from the State Treasury,
they will have to show results.
That is to say they will be forced
to produce graduates. The wheels ol
education will not grind slowly / or
finely in California. The orange or
chards of the South and the raisin
fields of the North will be infested

| with a creature more disastrous than
the boll weevil—the unbaked college
graduate.
It is only natural, however, that
everyone should want their sons and
daughters to he college graduates.
The insidious propaganda has been
spread for years that a college edu
cation results in the Midas touch.
Who can resist the call? The col
leges themselves have for years been
parties to this national lie and by
their own mouth they v/ill destroy
1 themselves unless they .undo the
falsehood.
I Berkeley at the present time is
; about to feel the axe of financial
retrenchment. They are begging and
pleading to' (he people not to saeri-
I fice education to the depression. But
the question may well be raised
whether the peoples as a body should
pay to send thousand and thousands
through college. Most of them are
wasting their own time and the
' money of the State.
I am a democrat in that I feel that
every citizen should have a chance
to get a college education —let almost
all come who will. But let the flunk
ing axe become a threshing machine
—mowing down all wh olack the
brains or the educational desire or
both. II is criminal to give "econ"
(o potential plumbers. *
Of course, as long as private col
leges need students and as long as
1 fond parents are unwilling or unable
! to look a child in the face, they can
get their degrees. But the State
j should not pay the bill.

I Berkeley at the present time is

retrenchment. They are begging and

the question may well be raised
whether the peoples as a body should

through college. Most of them are
wasting their own time and the
' money of the State.
I am a democrat in that I feel that
every citizen should have a chance
to get a college education —let almost
all come who will. But let the flunk
ing axe become a threshing machine

both. II is criminal to give "econ"

Of course, as long as private col
leges need students and as long as

j should not pay the bill.
George Washington and the "boys"
of 1776 started it and we have been
paying for it ever since. Now demo
cracy is a fine thing. It is desirable
that all should be equal before the
law —in theory at least. In practice,
however, we must always remember
that the late Senator Walsh's state
ment, "You can't convict a million
dollars in the United States," is still
the living gospel.
But because everyone has a vote
and equality before the Jaw the mob
immediately assumes that equality is
trumps and everyone is entitled to
13 of them. The latest manifestation
><l' this old superstition is the move
in the? Legislature to establish seven
more state colleges in California—to
bring higher education to the "pea
pull." This is to be realized by wav
ing the golden wand of added ap
propriations over seven teacher
training schools—misnamed teachers'
colleges.
If this little scheme is pushed
through, we will have even more
college graduates looking for jobs
than we have now. It will soon be
necessary to hold a Ph.D. to get a
service-station job; an A.B. will no
longer be sufficient. For if these
seven colleges are to continue to
suck funds from the State Treasury,
they will have to show results.
That is to say they will be forced
to produce graduates. The wheels ol
education will not grind slowly / or
finely in California. The orange or
chards of the South and the raisin
fields of the North will be infested

| with a creature more disastrous than
the boll weevil—the unbaked college
graduate.
It is only natural, however, that
everyone should want their sons and
daughters to he college graduates.
The insidious propaganda has been
spread for years that a college edu
cation results in the Midas touch.
Who can resist the call? The col
leges themselves have for years been
parties to this national lie and by
their own mouth they v/ill destroy
1 themselves unless they .undo the
