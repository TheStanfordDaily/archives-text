## A 						Happy Settlement Out of Court 
### 
There has been considerable com
motion and bickering between the
members of Stanford's championship
water poJo team hi id the members
of Stanford's championship Ex Com
mittee recently concerning the legal
issuance of gold water polo balls
the water polo boys.
The case has been settled out of
court to the satisfaction of every
one concerned, us the water polo
hoys received their glittering
trinkets and the Kx Committee did
not have to transgress its beloved
Constitution. Which is just dandy,
as no one doubted that the water
polo hoys deserved the awards,
for they constitute the greatest
collegiate team in their sport in
the United States and they carried
the national champions to four
extra periods.
And now, if someone gives the
water polo boys watches and chains,
they will have something to dangle i
.••cross their vest-fronts.
CLARIFICATION OF ALL
THIS COMMOTION
The commotion and bickering,
arose when the water polo boys re- j
quested permission from the Ex !
Committee to buy the glittering I
trinkets with money accumulated;
for that purpose by Coach Nort
Thornton. The Ex Committee, care
fully thumbing the well-thujnbed j
pages of its Constitution, found this
clause:
(Article 8, Section <i)f "All men I
who have made their letter on a
varsity major sport team in a year
in which California is defeated
shall receive a gold emblem."
Under these circumstances, Bill
Corbus, President of the A.S.S.U. j
and the Ex Committee, interpreted!
the clause to include an unwritten '
negation to the official issuance of |
gold (mblems to members of a
minor sport team. Corbus, whose
duty it is to uphold the A.S.S.U.
Constitution, was willing to allow
Dean Kirkwood of the Law School
to interpret the clause and to abide
by Kirkwood's decision.
THE SOCCER BOYS HAVE *
VEST DECORATIONS
To complicate the situation, the 1
soccer team (another minor sport j
aggregation) usually purchases, with
money donated by ex-Stanford soc
cer players, gold soccer balls when
Ilarry Maloney's men win a cham- j
pionship. But they do so without re- j
questing permission from the Ex!
Committee, and the Ex Committee j
never interferes.
In the case of the water polo
hoys, the Ex Committee was i
therefore apparently doing only its 1
duty. And the water polo hoys
showed the correct judgment and
spirit when they purchased the
glittering trinkets themselves and
omitted the word "Stanford" from
the engraving. By doing this, the
water polo boys made their pur
chase legal: in fact, if anyone
else wishes to purchase for him- .

it.

There has been considerable com
motion and bickering between the
members of Stanford's championship
water poJo team hi id the members
of Stanford's championship Ex Com
mittee recently concerning the legal
issuance of gold water polo balls
the water polo boys.
The case has been settled out of
court to the satisfaction of every
one concerned, us the water polo
hoys received their glittering
trinkets and the Kx Committee did
not have to transgress its beloved
Constitution. Which is just dandy,
as no one doubted that the water
polo hoys deserved the awards,
for they constitute the greatest
collegiate team in their sport in
the United States and they carried
the national champions to four
extra periods.
And now, if someone gives the
water polo boys watches and chains,
they will have something to dangle i
.••cross their vest-fronts.
CLARIFICATION OF ALL
THIS COMMOTION
The commotion and bickering,
arose when the water polo boys re- j
quested permission from the Ex !
Committee to buy the glittering I
trinkets with money accumulated;
for that purpose by Coach Nort
Thornton. The Ex Committee, care
fully thumbing the well-thujnbed j
pages of its Constitution, found this
clause:
(Article 8, Section <i)f "All men I
who have made their letter on a
varsity major sport team in a year
in which California is defeated
shall receive a gold emblem."
Under these circumstances, Bill
Corbus, President of the A.S.S.U. j
and the Ex Committee, interpreted!
the clause to include an unwritten '
negation to the official issuance of |
gold (mblems to members of a
minor sport team. Corbus, whose
duty it is to uphold the A.S.S.U.
Constitution, was willing to allow
Dean Kirkwood of the Law School
to interpret the clause and to abide
by Kirkwood's decision.
THE SOCCER BOYS HAVE *
VEST DECORATIONS
To complicate the situation, the 1
soccer team (another minor sport j
aggregation) usually purchases, with
money donated by ex-Stanford soc
cer players, gold soccer balls when
Ilarry Maloney's men win a cham- j
pionship. But they do so without re- j
questing permission from the Ex!
Committee, and the Ex Committee j
never interferes.
In the case of the water polo
hoys, the Ex Committee was i
therefore apparently doing only its 1
duty. And the water polo hoys
showed the correct judgment and
spirit when they purchased the
glittering trinkets themselves and
omitted the word "Stanford" from
the engraving. By doing this, the
water polo boys made their pur
chase legal: in fact, if anyone
else wishes to purchase for him- .

the engraving "Water Polo Cham
pions, l!):s:r on it and thinks that
he can find ten men in a hurry to
withstand the challenge of Ted
Wigct, Gordy Graves, etc., the Ex
Committee will do nothing about j
it.
