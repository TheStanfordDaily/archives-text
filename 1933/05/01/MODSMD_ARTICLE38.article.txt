### Feg Murray, '16 
While Stanford and U.S.C. track
men rested in preparation for their
all-important meet in the Olympic
Stadium next Saturday, several
veteran performers and a flock of
newcomers throughout the country
turned in scintillating tinier and
distances over the week-end.
Heading the pack were two peren
nial sprint champions, Ralph Met
calfe and Frank Wykoff. Metcalfe
plowed his way through 100 yards
of muddy track in 9.7 seconds, while
Wykoff covered the lightning-fast
Santa Barbara track in 9.5 seconds,
indicating he is far from ready to
hand up his spikes for good.
Lawson Robertson uncovered an
other great quarter-miler to replacc
the injured Bill Carr when Howard
Jones reeled off a 47.2 quarter-mile
to lead the Pennsylvania quartet, to
a 3:17.2 victory in the four-man mile
event at the Penn Relays. Other fea
ture events at Philadelphia gave the
great Jack Keller a 14.3 second vic
tory in the high hurdles, and Dick
Hardy a 9.9 second triumph in the

100-yard dash. Yale's Keith Brown
vaulted 14 feet, *4 inch, George
Spitz of N.Y.U. high-jumped G feet,
s ;i .| inches, and Werntz of Colgate
flung the javelin 204 feet, 9'a inches.
Two San Francisco high-school

turned in outstanding performances.
Claude McWilliams of Commerce
High School, San Francisco, closed
a four-year prep career by running
the 100 in 9.7 seconds, and Varoff of
Balboa High School pole-vaulted 13
feet, 3% inches. Johnny Wood of
Sacramento Junior College ran the
two hurdle races in 14.6 and 24.1
seconds, respectively. Wood, who
will transfer to California next year,

only to find the course was two feet
too short. He ran his 14.6 race
against time. Stolp of Modesto Jun
