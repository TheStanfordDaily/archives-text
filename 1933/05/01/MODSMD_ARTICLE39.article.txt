# Poloists Lose To San Mateo
## 
### 
Although playing the best brand
of polo they have displayed this
year, Stanford's sharp-shooting
horsemen were nosed out 10 to 9 by
a group of San Mateo clubmen last
Friday in the semi-finals of the Pa
cific Coast Low Goal Tournament.
Up against one of the strongest
quartets they have met this year,
Captain Gordan's team was able to
hold a 9 to 5 advantage until the
end of the sixth chukker. Greater
experience of the San Mateo four
in eight-chukker contests, however,
enabled them to close up the gap
and win in the final period.
Will Tevis, a 5-goal man and rated
as the best polo player on the penin
sula, rode at number three for the
victors. Stanford's lineup consisted of
the old reliable combination of
Luppe Luppen at number one,
Woody Mel one at two, Captain Pete
Gillham at three, and Johnny Myers
at back.
