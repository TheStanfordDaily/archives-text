SHE DONE HIM WRONG (Para
mount; —At the Varsity Theatre.
Sex, after hiding behind Eugene
O'Neill, inaedchen in uniform, and
this and that over the White House,
steps out in front again in a good
beery melodrama full of good whole
some vulgarity.
The story, almost undiscernable,
doesn't matter at all; the surround
ing cast, unusually good, blushes al
most unseen; the sets, lighting, and
direction, 'way above average, are
relegated to the background; if ever
any performer was "the whole
show," is Mae West and that show,
"She Done Him Wrong."
Hers is the most consistent per
formance the screen has seen in
some time. She plays Lou straight
and relentlessly as "the finest wo
man that, ever walked the streets,"
with no bid for sympathy, no visible
attempt at humor, and no effort to
make the remotest impression on the
audience. It is a broad piece of work,
and why not?
While undulating througlv "She
Done Him Wrong," Miss West sings
three songs, "Frankie and Johnny,"
"Easy Rider," and "I Like a Guy
What Takes His Time." In the latter
she characterizes herself as a "J'ast
moving gal that likes 'em slow" . . .
In the shadow of any oth"r star
than Diamond Lil, Noah Beery
would win superlatives for his per

formance, and it is an excellent piece i
of work. Cary Grant, Gilbert Roland,
and Owen Moore would, under other
circumstances, get at least a para- f
graph apiece.
"She Done Him Wrong" is not ;
.smutty; it transcends smut. It is not
lowbrow; it is so lowbrow as to be
highbrow. It is entertainment.
