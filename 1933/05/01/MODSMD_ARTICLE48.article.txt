### OLD DR. ALGAR 
D.T.'S
ITHACA, N.Y.—A new treatment
for alcoholic cases under which a
patient with delirium tremeins can
heroine "normal" overnight is de
scribed by three Ithaca scientists. —
S.F. Chronicle.
Some scientists figured it best
To give their invention a test.
They siphoned some brew
To a monk from the zoo—
And lie started to build them a
nest.
This wasn't the action tiny wanted
They tried it again—all undaunted
"A drink alcoholic
To make the monk frolic
And properly act as if haunted."
One scientist had a new clue
Said he, "Give him Sea Island
Dew."
The monk drank for days
But couldn't be phased—
The stull only tested .... "3.2."
