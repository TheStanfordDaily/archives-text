## Odds Favor Wets, Says Political Scientist 
### David Mellinkoff 
As glass after glass of sparkling
Blatz rolls merrily down DRY
throats, WETS continue the fight for
absolute abolition of the 18th
Amendment through the action of
conventions in at least thirty-six of
the sovereign states.
According to Thomas S. Bar
clay .Associate Professor of Politi
cal Science, "the people of the
United States arc about to enjoy
a new constitutional experience"
for never before has this mode of
ratification been used.
In the absence of political prece
dents as guides along the path of
repeal, the Constitution is the only
source of information. Concerning
the amending clause, Barclay said:
"It seems clear that the framers of
the Constitution had in mind con
ventions called into being by inde
pendent action of the separate
states."
That arid and obstinate legisla
tures may even prevent an expres
sion of popular opinion through the
conventions was indicated by the
Stanford professor.
Said he: "There is no legal method
by which a legislature can be forced
to provide the machinery for a rati
fying convention." Such a difficulty
is not apparent .however, since a
majority of legislatures have, already
acted lo provide the necessary legal
set-up for conventions."
Dr. Barclay declared that no party
test should be considered in the se
lection of conventoin delegates "as
no fair vote could be secured in that
manner."
The odds seem to favor repeal.
For, said Barclay, another con
vention may be called if the first
conventoin rejects repeal, but drys
are complctel ythwarted if the
amendment is once ratified.
