# Food Specialists Praise Bean--Bostoners Doubtful

As Stanford goes on the bean i
standard for today, it may rest as
sured that it will be nourished by a
vegetable containing 19.6 per cent
carbohydrate and 6.!) per cent pro
tein, in baked beans, not including
liberal amounts of pork, catsup, or
whatever trimming may be wheedled
out of campus cooks.
A campus authority states that, j
supplemented with milk and a fresh
vegetable (this is where the apples (
come in), beans give a well-balanced
diet on which one can be happy for
more than the single day required
in the interest of charity. However,
another local scientist, who hails
from Boston, states emphatically
that he hopes never to see a bean {

again.
Investigation in the Library—be- '
tween the cards marked Beams (see J
girders) and Bears (black, brown, j
and polar)—revealed that some peo
ple have written books dealing with j
the lowly bean, and that the Com- j
mitten on "Ways and Beans" pre
sented a report to the House in 1920 I
showing that California produced !
the second largest amount of the
canned variety in the United States.
One million bushels altogether were
canned in 1914.
Perhaps the eight students regis- j
tered in the bawl-out as residents j
of Massachusetts should be excused
from today's activities, but the rest
of us eat beans and feel nourished
and charitable.
