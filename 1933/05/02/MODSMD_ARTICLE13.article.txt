# City Council Vetoes Move Asking Beer
## Dry Leaders Pile Motion With 500 Names 
### 
Palo Alto 3.2 beer enthusiasts last
night lost another round in their
battle to legalize beer in the Uni
versity city when the city council
denied a merchant's petition asking
that the city ordinances be changed
to permit the legal sale of beer.
The council also received a pe
tition presented by Mrs. Louise
James, head of the local W.C.T.U.,
signed by over 500 citizens and
several church organizations, ask
ing that Palo Alto leave its "dry"
ordinances unchanged.
City Attorney Rumwell pointed
out that this virtually closes all
moves to get beer in Palo Alto with
out a popular vote.
Faces Penal Code
"Even if a petition now being cir
culated does force an election, beer
backers will still be faced with the
penal code," declared Rumwell.
"All amendments to city charters
must be approved by the State Leg
islature," he pointed out. "This will
probably take at least two years as
I don't believe an election can be
forced before the present session of
the. legislature closes."
Little Effect
Rumwell admitted last night's pe
tition would have no effect upon
the situation "except insofar as it
would influence public opinion."
When asked what his next move
would he. Attorney Adron Beenc,
head of the wet faction, refused
to comment, except to say that lie
was working out an approach from
a "new angle" which was not yet
ready for publication.
