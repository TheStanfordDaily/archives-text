# R.O.T.C. Heads Silent On Summer Camp Rumors
## 
### 
Rumors that the annual R.O.T.C.
summer, camps would not be held
this year were rampant on the cam
pus yesterday as students waited
results of the army economy cuts
reported to have been placed before
President Roosevelt.
Official confirmation or dcn:;.'l that
the rumors had any basis was not
given by R.O.T.C. heads here.
Just what part of the army the
economies, if okehed, would affect
was unknown. As appropriations
have already b<*en made it will
probably entail return of appor
tioned money.
Until orders to the contrary are
received, the local army unit will
continue with plans for the camps
to be held at Monterey and Fort
Baker in San Francisco.
