# Home Builds Iron Men With Funds From Drive
## 
### BOB LETTS 
As money began rolling into the
I Stanford Convalescent Home Drive
! fund on the campus last night, con
; tributors began 1o see where they
I were about to convert dollars into
I iron men. Over on the northeast
I edge of the campus are some CO
j youngsters whose bodies—either
clippled, crushed, or malnourished—
jwill respond to treatments that the
| fund will help provide.
The Kale Dillon McLaughlin Unit
of the Home, one of six buildings
J there, houses two long rows of beds
that have boys from 4 to 14, victims
I of heart trouble, infantile paralysis,
. forms of tuberculosis, and a few
other serious ailments to which

.children are susceptible.
One patient, aged (j, came to the
home with a heart so enlarged that
I it touched his ribs. Two years later
he walked out, his heart normal.
Home to San Francisco he went,
and saved his pennies.
Two weeks ago he had saved a
dollar. He bought a round-trip tick
et on the train, came down on a
Sunday, walked from the Pal-j Alto
station to the Convalescent Home,
and entered the office of Head
Nurse Margaret Spande, breathing
normally. The stroll is close to a
mile, quite a trek for a kid who not
so long before had been given only
a fair chance to live.
