# B.A.C. Will Send Strong Team To I. C. 4A Track Meet
## Board Also Decides To Send Joe Coughlin And Sam Lee To Intercollegiate Tennis Tournament At Merion Cricket Club In Philadelphia 
### 
COKMALLY adding another hooking to the great combined Stanford-
Southern California track and field show, the Board of Athletic Control
has indicated that a fully representative team would ho taken to the
Intercollegiate A.A.A.A. meet at Cambridge, May 26 and 27. The an
nouncement came as a reversal of a previous decision to send a Limited
number to the collegiate classic.
At the same time the Board decided that Captain Joe Coughlin and
Sammy Lee of the tennis team would be sent to the intercollegiate tennis
play which will be held at the Merion Cricket Club at Philadelphia in June.

t> Possibility that a five-man golf
: team would travel to Buffalo, N.Y.,
j to represent Stanford in the colle
i giate golf competition this month
has been discussed.
Composition of the track team will
be made known shortly before the
trip East begins and will probably
be decided after the squad showing
next Saturday, when the Trojan-
Cardinal show goes on the boards
j for the second time in two weeks.
Of the participants in last year's
! meet only Bob Jones, who won first
i in the discus, is missing, but Ben
Eastman, who accounted for a help
ful nine points, is in dubious condi
tion. The fact that Ben is ostensibly
| being kept out of the second S.C.
meet points to his preservation for
the intcrcollegiates.
Les Hables in the sprints; the
weight quartet of Lyman, Dunn,
Laborde, and Gray; Miller, and Dea
con, the sky-climbing vaulters;
javelin - tosser Mottram; Lloyd
Schween in the high jump, and Wil
liams and Zaches in the broad jumps
appear on the face of this season's
i performances to have the best
chances of placing in the 1.C.4-A.
