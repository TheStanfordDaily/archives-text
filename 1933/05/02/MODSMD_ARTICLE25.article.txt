# '34 Prom Bids To Sell For $3
## 
### 
A Junior Prom at $3 per couple.
That is what the Class of '34 proni
| ised the campus last night with the
announcement by Chairman Herb
Sanderson that the affair scheduled
for the Women's Gym on Friday
evening, May 19, would be greater
and more elaborate than ever, in
spite of the reduction in the tariff.
Pointing out the fact that the
necessities for the affair can be had
j at much lower rates than at any
previous lime, the Prom committee
| has made this forty per cent cut in
the price of bids over that of last
year and has unanimously voted not
to sacrifice any item whatsoever in
i the effort to present a succesful
dance.
Negotiations have been opened
with prominent orchestra leaders in
the Bay Region to bring a well
known musical aggregation 1o the
campus that evening. Marc Krupp
j and his'sub-committee are working
at present to conclude arrangements
for this particular.
The 1933 Junior Prom will show
many new features previously tin
heard of at a similar affair, Sander
son added. Bids will be placed on
sale early next week at the A.S.S.U.
offices in the Old Union, and there
; will be only a limited number avail
l able.
