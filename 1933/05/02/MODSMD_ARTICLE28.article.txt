# "Mr. Smith's" Joke Materializes Palo Alto Merchants Get the Point
## 
### 
The court plaster slipped oil' one of Palo Alto's old sore
spots last night, revealing a festeril1<4 public opinion which
ran over and Mistered the Hoard of Safety's greatly pub
licized trallic enforcement campaign. A group of repre
sentative citizens, merchants of the downtown area who
realize that the progression of modern times demands an
occasional bit of liberality, spoke their minds before the
board, with the result that the gentlemen of both factions
became warmish in the region of the collar. The board
members tried frantically to cover up the gaping new
wounds pierced in the side of law enforcement, but neither
side would admit error, and the meeting ended in a stale
male.
The merchants charged that the safety board, in its
hair-splitting campaign against petty violations of trallic
ordinances, has actually scared motorists out of the down
town district of Palo Alto, at ;i tremendous loss to the local
business men. The board, naturally, stated a denial. Then
the aggressors charged that the board has, in effect, ad
mitted the absurdity of such a rigid enforcement cam
paign bv back watering. This the board also denied, but
none of the members were observed dragging out the po
lice record of arrests to prove their contention.
The evening's wrangle must have proved pretty enter
taining to a certain "Mr. Smith," who 'way back around
the lirst of March made himself unpopular in many quar
ters by snickering at the huge joke which the town of Palo
Alto, all unaware, was playing upon itself. The business
men didn't seem to care one way or the other about strict
enforcement of trallic ordinances in those days; they didn't
even see the joke that "Mr. Smith" saw. And last night
there was no joke to see. The prank has been played, and
the Palo Alto merchants recognized themselves as the vic
tims of an unintentional practical joke played by an ultra
( onservalivc small town.
