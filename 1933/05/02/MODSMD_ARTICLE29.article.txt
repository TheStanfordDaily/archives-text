# Another Salary Cut This Time in a Good Cause
## 
### 
Salaries of Stanford faculty members are to be cut ten
per cent this month, some months earlier than was pre
viously thought necessary. Salary cuts are no longer news
they have become so usual in these days that they sel
dom receive comment. Hut there are reasons behind this
particular movement that make it of prime interest.
One reason for the cut is, of course, reduced income
due to decreased registration. More important than this,
however, is the fact that much of the money which might
have been used for salaries has gone to iill the increased
demand upon the tuition note fund. Such a displacement
of funds is an indication of a large degree of unselfishness
; nd good sense on the part of the administration and fac
tills.
Stanford, noted since its inception as the "poor boy's
school." lias had, through necessity, to become more and
more expensive in recent years. This has been due to lack
of support from alumni and a low hut safe income from
the I niversity's endowment. Nevertheless the tuition fund
has made possible the registration of many of the "poor
I:ids" who would not otherwise have graced the Farm.
The continuation, and even enlarging, of this fund
through a period w hen everything else is being cut to the
bone is certainly to be highly commended. II is to be hoped
that the faculty may benefit materially, through bonuses
or salary raises, when these loans are repaid.
