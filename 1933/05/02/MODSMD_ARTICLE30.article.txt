# Of Some Interest to Palo Alto Taxpayers
## 
### 
In view of the current discussion and action in the
three-way Palo Alto vs. Stanford vs. Beer situation, it
might be interesting to the town's taxpayers to reflect upon
the experiences of San Francisco charity officials since the
ret urn of legal lager.
According to figures released last week by the director
of public relief, .>.02.) persons have left the city's relief rolls
since April !S. Heads ot families lead single men in the list
of those now able to live without charity.
The director has been quoted as saying that the return
of beer had emphatically helped in many lines of work
mid business.
IVrliaps not irrelevant is the last monthly report of the
Federal Keserve Hank, also recently released. According
to its figures, business in California, which dropped off
during March due to the hank crisis and the earthquake,
came back strong in the last of the month and continued
to gain in April.
Palo Alto taxpayers who, like all other state taxpayers,
have watched their taxes being allotted to charity in
mounting percentages, may find these facts of San Fran
cisco relief interesting. They may even bear them in mind
w hen voting yes or no on the coming beer ballot.
The editorial staff will meet at 1:15 o'clock.
