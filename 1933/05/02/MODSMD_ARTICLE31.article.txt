# BULL SESSION
## THE 						HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
Ilerr Hitler was confronted by a
hostile majority and he beat it down.
He w.is opposed, by Hindenberg and
the aged president was sent away
to study his beer steins or his steins
of beer. The Churches attacke d him
and he incorporated them into his
party. The press ridiculed him and
(hey were suppressed. Herr Hitler
has changed from a slightly ridicu
lous and bedraggled Bavarian Her
ring to Kingfish of Germany.
Nothing has been able to stand
before him. But now the Feminist
Leaders are threatening a nation
wide uprising against the Nazis. That
is really serious. Hitler in ballyhoo
ing the return of the "good old days"
when Germany scared the world
and German women listened to the
men and did the washing. They ob
ject to doing the washing, as of
yore. They refuse to return to the
old days when the women polished
the beer glasses and the men did the
rest.
The very idea of an army of sput
tering and steaming brown-shirts
being beaten by the women seems
far-fetched at first glance—but only
at first glance. The women can
laugh Nazism into a cocked hat and
then store the hat in the national
uttic along with the memory of some
400,000 dead at Verdun. When Mr.
Nazi comes home bubbling over
with military spirit and visions of
world-splendor, the wife begins to
laugh. When he asks for his slippers
with the gesture of Hitler ordering
a grand march, she asks him "How

! he gets that way?"
When he asks for stuffed chicken,
she tells him cold beans are more
in keeping with the discipline of
Potsdam. He revels in word-pictures
of gallant armies, but if he is like
the average person over here, he
would rather have his chicken. She
gives her mother-in-law the best
bed and makes him sleep on the
couch—"tough stuff for tough men,"
.she tells him.
Hindenberg, the pen is mightier
, than the sword, and the petticoat
rules everything. The best pa»'t of a
1 uniform is the feminine adoration
that it awakens. If the women re
fuse to go ga-ga over a snappy out
fil with brass buttons and leather
straps, whiit can a man do? Hitler
has a great hold on his men, but
there probably isn't a brown-shirt
i in all Germany that wouldn't chouse
1 a moon-light walk with Marlene
"Dietrich to a typical Hitler latl ering
operation at its best. And '1 she
happens to be the blonde barmaid
at the corner saloon (and not Mar
lene), well—after all, Hitler isn't a
blonde.
This is all very beautiful and logi
cal except that it assumes women
to be smarter than the men—which
they aren't. Hitler no doubt "slays"
the women as he does the men. That
moustache and that uniform must
"get" them dancing in circles. In
theory, women are supposed to be
against war and militarism but they
i never have been yet. There will soon
be a Nazi women's auxiliary—with
j salutes and everything.

Ilerr Hitler was confronted by a
hostile majority and he beat it down.
He w.is opposed, by Hindenberg and
the aged president was sent away
to study his beer steins or his steins
of beer. The Churches attacke d him
and he incorporated them into his
party. The press ridiculed him and
(hey were suppressed. Herr Hitler
has changed from a slightly ridicu
lous and bedraggled Bavarian Her
ring to Kingfish of Germany.
Nothing has been able to stand
before him. But now the Feminist
Leaders are threatening a nation
wide uprising against the Nazis. That
is really serious. Hitler in ballyhoo
ing the return of the "good old days"
when Germany scared the world
and German women listened to the
men and did the washing. They ob
ject to doing the washing, as of
yore. They refuse to return to the
old days when the women polished
the beer glasses and the men did the
rest.
The very idea of an army of sput
tering and steaming brown-shirts
being beaten by the women seems
far-fetched at first glance—but only
at first glance. The women can
laugh Nazism into a cocked hat and
then store the hat in the national
uttic along with the memory of some
400,000 dead at Verdun. When Mr.
Nazi comes home bubbling over
with military spirit and visions of
world-splendor, the wife begins to
laugh. When he asks for his slippers
with the gesture of Hitler ordering
a grand march, she asks him "How

! he gets that way?"
When he asks for stuffed chicken,
she tells him cold beans are more
in keeping with the discipline of
Potsdam. He revels in word-pictures
of gallant armies, but if he is like
the average person over here, he
would rather have his chicken. She
gives her mother-in-law the best
bed and makes him sleep on the
couch—"tough stuff for tough men,"
.she tells him.
Hindenberg, the pen is mightier
, than the sword, and the petticoat
rules everything. The best pa»'t of a
1 uniform is the feminine adoration
that it awakens. If the women re
fuse to go ga-ga over a snappy out
fil with brass buttons and leather
straps, whiit can a man do? Hitler
has a great hold on his men, but
there probably isn't a brown-shirt
i in all Germany that wouldn't chouse
1 a moon-light walk with Marlene
"Dietrich to a typical Hitler latl ering
operation at its best. And '1 she
happens to be the blonde barmaid
at the corner saloon (and not Mar
lene), well—after all, Hitler isn't a
blonde.
This is all very beautiful and logi
cal except that it assumes women
to be smarter than the men—which
they aren't. Hitler no doubt "slays"
the women as he does the men. That
moustache and that uniform must
"get" them dancing in circles. In
theory, women are supposed to be
against war and militarism but they
i never have been yet. There will soon
be a Nazi women's auxiliary—with
j salutes and everything.
