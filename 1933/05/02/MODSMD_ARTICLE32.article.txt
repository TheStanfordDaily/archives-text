ERRATA ON "lIAWK ISLAND" ! I
Due to an error of the copy desk 1
the name of Pete Peck was omitted i
from the cast of "Hawk Island." For '
what was no fault of mine I tender <
my most abject apologies to Mr. i
Peck and to those who, like myself, c
enjoyed very much his excellent in
terpretation of Gregory Sloane, host (
of Hawk Island. Peck handled !
splendidly the difficult task of co- t
ondinating the action of the play, and (
injected much real comedy.

IN THE NATURE OF CATHARSIS. ;
Eupheimism as a habit.
It is distressing to observe the eva- 1
sive state of contemporary criticism, j
most particularly that, of the drama, i
For, barring the critics of New York i
and one or two eastern cities, criti- ;
cism is under the thumb of the press i
agent and practiced either by worthy j j
men forced to subject themselves to
write undeserved praise or meek i
euphemism by the business manage
ment-, or by chronically enthusiastic
female souvenirists.
The enforced motto of the first 1
sort is "Be Gentle" and the willing
credo of the latter "Anything on a
Stage is Good." Oiie may frequently,

by copious reading between the
lines, arrive at the conclusion that
a certain play is badly produced or
unworthy ol production. But this
euphemism, as well as being annoy
ing,- destroys the purpose of criti
cism.
Bui beyond this, there is a great
deal of possible analysis, critical or
the basis of criticism, which is nei
ther praise nor condemnation, but
even that never appeal's.
Instead, criticism, as practiced, for
example, in the dailies of San Fran
cisco, has become synopsis, remini
scence, and fiat praise-by-adjective.
Merely to state that an actor has
been brilliant or pleasing or that a
play has been enjoyable or not, is
not. true criticism. The essential of
criticism is analysis of such terms,
an observance of the various ele
ments which result in such an
abrupt statement.
Such criticism need not be over
meticulous in expression, but should
be careful in observation. The emo
tional determination to name a play
pleasing or poor must be backed up
by some intellectual activity, some
perceptive resaoning, before it can
rightfully be called criticism.

of Hawk Island. Peck handled !
splendidly the difficult task of co- t

injected much real comedy.

IN THE NATURE OF CATHARSIS. ;
Eupheimism as a habit.
It is distressing to observe the eva- 1
sive state of contemporary criticism, j
most particularly that, of the drama, i
For, barring the critics of New York i
and one or two eastern cities, criti- ;
cism is under the thumb of the press i
agent and practiced either by worthy j j
men forced to subject themselves to
write undeserved praise or meek i
euphemism by the business manage
ment-, or by chronically enthusiastic
female souvenirists.
The enforced motto of the first 1
sort is "Be Gentle" and the willing
credo of the latter "Anything on a
Stage is Good." Oiie may frequently,

by copious reading between the
lines, arrive at the conclusion that
a certain play is badly produced or
unworthy ol production. But this
euphemism, as well as being annoy
ing,- destroys the purpose of criti
cism.
Bui beyond this, there is a great
deal of possible analysis, critical or
the basis of criticism, which is nei
ther praise nor condemnation, but
even that never appeal's.
Instead, criticism, as practiced, for
example, in the dailies of San Fran
cisco, has become synopsis, remini
scence, and fiat praise-by-adjective.
Merely to state that an actor has
been brilliant or pleasing or that a
play has been enjoyable or not, is
not. true criticism. The essential of
criticism is analysis of such terms,
an observance of the various ele
ments which result in such an
abrupt statement.
Such criticism need not be over
meticulous in expression, but should
be careful in observation. The emo
tional determination to name a play
pleasing or poor must be backed up
by some intellectual activity, some
perceptive resaoning, before it can
rightfully be called criticism.
