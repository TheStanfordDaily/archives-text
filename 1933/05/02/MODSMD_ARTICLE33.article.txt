DUMB BELL
BALTIMORE—The boy who stood
on the burning deck is classed as a
moron by Professor Harry Allen
Overstreet, head of the department
of philosophy at the College of the
City of New York. Held up.a genera
tion ago as a shining example of
filial obedience because he stayed
where his father had told him to
stay, the boy was the hero of this
poem:
The boy stood on the burning deck,
Whence all but he had fled;
The flames that lit the battle's wreck
Shone 'round him o'er the dead.
Yet beautiful and bright lie stood.
As born to rule the storm,
A creature of heroic blood.
A proud, though childlike form.
Professor Overstreet claims the
youth did not have the intelligence
to ad;»pt himself to a changing situ
ation.

TOUGH GUY
A "chin golf" tournament will be
held at San Quentin when the en
tire inmate population will "tee off" 1
equipped with razor blades in an
effort to shave with the smallest
number of strokes.—S. F. Chronicle.,

Now Butch IYTcGuirc made a bet
He'd win a prize. And so
lie would have, but—disqualified
They found he'd used a hoe.
