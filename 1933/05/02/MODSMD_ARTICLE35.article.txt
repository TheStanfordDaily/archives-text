The Editor, Sir:
I may be wrong, and if not there
must be some explanation, but after
pondering over the situation, I can't
help but come to the conclusion that
somebody is wrong, and that's put
ting it conservatively! If it is 1, I'd
darn well like to know it!
Concerning "Hawk Island"—un
doubtedly the performance was not
outstanding, but it was certaintly
entertaining, and some of the roles
were done very well. "Churchill,
Crary, and Collins excel," says the
Daily's critic. Granted! But I won
dered why someone thought the
leading man's work was not even
worth mentioning.
As the curtain lowered, I natural
ly, with everybody else, started
placing the actors, as did the critic,
in graduate positions, but I had Peck
up with Churchill, Crary, and Col
lins, and from what people were
.saying when I left the auditorium,
1 felt I was not alone in my opinion.
Our critic, however, seems to dif
fer. Well, that is certainly the privi
lege of a critic, but I think it's hard
ly unfair to ask the critic to be a
little more explicit, just a little more
elucidating in her criticism.. Am I
asking too much? Am I the one in
error?
