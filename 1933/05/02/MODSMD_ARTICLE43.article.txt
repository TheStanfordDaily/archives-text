## WRESTLERS PETITION; EX COMMITTEE CAN ACT 
### 
A petition will be presented to the
Ex Committee at today's meeting. It
is a petition containing over 150 sig
natures, and it represents a request
to make wrestling a second-class
minor sport.
The arguments in favor of legal
izing wrestling (not .'5.2) are simple
and convincing. Fifteen men grap
pled conscientiously last quarter
in the Advanced Class and many
more were included among the
beginners. The number would have
been doubled or trebled had
wrestling been a regular sport. The
lads are good athletes, they are
interested in their sport, and they
deserve recognition.
Stanford unofficially entered a
four-man wrestling team in the
Minor Sports Carnival, and won one
first when Jake Butts took the 155-
pound title. Len Youdall fought his
way to the finals; Hugh Powers
the last round through a
bye; and Dave Cooke lost to the
eventual 145-pound champion. In
addition, Butts reached the semi
finals in the P.A.A. wrestling meet
a I Berkeley.
That is a surprisingly fine show
ing for an informal sports team.
All theories of amateur sport in
sist thai the Ex Committee arrange
1o proffer an amendment to the
A.S.S.U. constitution that the cam
pus can vote upon and thereby
register its approval or disapproval
of regular wrestling. The objections,
if any, will of course be economic;
as Abo Mellinkoff might say, all ob
jections are economic.
But even if wrestling does cost
the 15.A.C. a few dollars, it will be
money well-spent. The situation
now rests with the Ex Committee.
