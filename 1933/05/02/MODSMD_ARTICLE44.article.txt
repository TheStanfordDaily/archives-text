# A 						TRAGIC ACCIDENT TO AN S.C. RUNNER
## 
### 
Bob Norene, U.S.C. distance run
ner who wns doped for a third in
the mile against Stanford but who
wa.s beaten by his teammate, Ash
craft, received such a serious injury
in an auto accident Sunday night
that the amputation of his leg was
necessary.
Norene is known to the Stanford
campus only as a member of the
Trojan track squad. That squad,
whether it, loses to or wins from
Stanford, consists of good sports.
Norene was a good sport whose run
ning career was ended prematurely
by an unfortunate accident.
