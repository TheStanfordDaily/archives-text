The Board of Athletic Control has
appointed a committee consisting of
A1 Masters and Fred Glover to con
sider the advisability of issuing
Block "S" cards to members of mi
nor sports teams who win a national
championship and therefore a Block
"S." The present practice is for the
B.A.C. to issue cards only to those
who win their major letters in a
major sport; special Block "S's" are
awarded by the Ex Committee and
Block "S" cards are issued inde
pendently by (he B.A.C.
There are at (lie present time
some 12(10 Block "S" cards out
standing, since all Stanford men
who have ever won a Block "S"
in a unajor sport are entitled to
such a card. The controversy con
cerning the limitation of this colos
sal issue is separate from the pres
ent discussion.
But in the light of such a large
number of outstanding, it
seems only fair that minor sport
athletes who arc honored with a
Block "S" by th'e Ex Committee
should be similarly honored with
Block "S" cards by the B.A.C. Ted
Wiget, Phil Smith, Austin Clapp, and
Johnny Adams, to mention some
contemporary luminaries, are fine
athletes who are all nationally
known. The B.A.C. would do no
harm and much good if it arranged
to issue cards to Block "S" winnei's
in minor sports. —Dick Strouse
