# TOPPING AND TODD SHOW UP WELL IN GRID SCRIMMAGES
## 
### Oliver Johnston 
Keith Topping, star basketball
player, and Ray Todd have proved
to be the new finds of the last two
Stanford grid scrimmages.
Topping, playing at end, spent one
solid hour in messing up almost
every play the first-string started.
Time and again he rushed in so fast
on punts that the kicker could not
even get his foot on fhe ball.
Ray Todd, playing fullback on i.
team consisting mainly of first- and
second-string men, averaged around
five yards per play. His best gaining
play was a straight off-tackle buck.
Todd and Grayson, playing on op
posite teams, put up a great line
bucking battle, see-sawing back and
forth over a distance of about thirty
yards.
Alustiza looked well at quarter,
ripping of! many good gains and
kicking well under fire.
Bob Maentz did some excellent
kicking, placing his punts consist
ently in the corner. His best boot
spiralled G5 yards in the air over
the safety man's head and rolled out
on the two-yard line.
Thomhill spent a good deal of time
working on passes, but protection
for the passers was so bad that only
one or two were completed. Grayson
continually found himself surround
ed by opposing linesmen with no
chance at all to get rid of the ball.
Wes Muller is going to play cen
ter, beginning today. Muller is handy
at backing up the line, which is a
big part of the center job.
Bones Hamilton, suffering from a
bad cold, is expected to be back in
suit today.
Tiny has called practice for Mon
day, Tuesday, Wednesday, and
Thursday, and new plays will be
given out in a chalk talk at 7:45
o'clock tonight.
