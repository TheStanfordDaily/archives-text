# WETS CARRY R.I. IN REPEAL VOTE
## 
### 
I PROVIDENCE, R.1., May 1 i,Tjâ€” I
| Seven rural towns in which polls
' closed early tonight had returned a
i better than three-to-one wet vote
| in the special election to name dele- j
J gates to a constitutional convention,
; which will decide whether Rhode
! Island will ratify the prohibition re
! peal amendment.
j Although the vote was light,
early indications were the wet
. vote, proportionately, may he even
heavier than in 1930, when, in a
referendum on prohibition, the
State went wet by more than four
I to one.
Polls in the larger cities did not
j close until 8 p.m., and after dinner
! voting in the centers of population
j was heavier than the day-time vote.
Thus, on the basis of complete
returns from the first seven towns
to report, wets had registered a gain
1 of about 12 per cent over their 1930
] strength despite the light vote.
