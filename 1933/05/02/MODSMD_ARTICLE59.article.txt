# FOES BLOCK HOUSE VOTE ON INFLATION
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 1 (A I )â€” Di
fferences within the huge Democratic
majority, after Republican chieftains
had blocked an immediate House
vote on the Roosevelt inflation bill,
today clouded plans for House action
on the farm relief bill and definitely
delayed final congressional approval
until later in the week.
A breach developed late today
between Democratic leaders as to
when the House should act. Chair
man Pou of the Rules Committee set
the vote-date for Wednesday. Byrns
of Tennessee, the Democraitc leader,
disclosed plans for action tomorrow
night. The issue remained unsettled.
Calling out, "Go get your rule and
jam it down our throats!" Repre
senative Snell of New York, Re
publican leader, earlier had flouted
Democratic plans to force a final
inflation vote today under a sus
pension of the rules. His objection
blocked immediate action.
