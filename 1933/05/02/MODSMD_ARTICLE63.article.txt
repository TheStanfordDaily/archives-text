# YANKS' AND SENATORS' OLD FEUD FLARES ANEW
## 
### 


The latest flareup between the
New York Yankees and WashÂ»
ington Senators at Washington
brought the liveliest fistic battle
seen in the major leagues in many
years. The fight started at second
base when Buddy Myer, Senator
shortstop, and Ben Chapman,
New York outfielder, swapped
punches after Myer accused Chap
man of spiking him as he slid
into the base. Immediately both
teams surged onto the field as
shown in picture above. After
quiet was restored and Chapman
was heading for the showers he
passed the Senators' dugout where
Earl Whitehall passed a remark
that Chapman answered with fly
ing fists. In picture below White
hall's back is to the camera.
