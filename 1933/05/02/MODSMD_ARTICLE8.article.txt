# Reading Jibes Hero Tragedy
## Players Will Accompany Lines With Actions 
### James Sandoe 
"Perhaps the funniest play in the
English language," writes H. F.
Rubenetein of "The Critic," Richard
Brinsley Sheridan's extravagant
drama which will be read next
Thursday evening under the spon
sorship of Sword and Sandals.
Sheridan's play was not the first
to be directed against the stiff, al
legedly classical heroic tragedy and
John Dryden, its leading exponent.
In 1671 appeared "The Rehearsal,"
a similar but far inferior satire by
George Villiers, Duke of Bucking
ham.
"The Critic" was first acted in
1779, over a century* later, and was
as much a thrust at critics and actors
as at playwrights. Its burlesque is
not unkind or bitter but neither is
it concealed. The play bounces along
good-humoredly for three short acts,
during which time all persons con
nected with the theatre, even to the
audience, have received hearty at
tention.
An important innovation by
Sword and Sandals is the introduc
tion of action to accompany the
lines. The cast has been rehearsing
strenuously and while no finished or
smooth acting is to be expected, it
is believed that their imitations of
"the grand manner" will be amus
ing-
The cast includes such campus
stage favorites as Marian Jones,
Myna Hughes, James Benet, Robert
Brauns, and Paul Crary, as weil as
a number of newer actors.
Curtain time has been set at 7:30
o'clock sharp. The reading will be
held in the Little Theatre.
