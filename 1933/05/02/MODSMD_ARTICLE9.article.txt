# IRATE TRADERS BRAND SAFETY BOARD'S STAND
## Palo Alto Merchants Charge 'Schoolboy Tactics' In Solving Problem 
### Jay Graves 
Facing a group of approximately
| 15 irate Palo Alto merchants who
charged 'he use of "schoolboy
tactics" in dealing with the city's
traffic problem, the Palo Alto
Safety Board last night stood pat
in its drive to rid Palo Alto of all
j speeders.
Outsiders, city residents, and
j Stanford students "don't have to be
i scared to drive in Palo Alto as long
as they obey the ordinances," an
swered Dr. Harvey Slater, head of
the board, to charges of pettiness in
i the enforcement of the regulations.
Flat Contradiction
Captain T. S. Glover, mem
i ber of the safety board, declared
that "there have been few arrests
! for minor offences."
Glenn Kenyon, druggist, flatly
i contradicted him with the statement
! that "there have been plenty of
i them." He named some incidents.
You have admitted that your
action has been wrong," charged
Kenyon. "Public opinion has been
5 so strong that you have had to
; backwater and up on jay
walking and parking restrictions
on University avenue."
"We haven't backwatered," shot
i back Andrew Hoy, third member of
the board.
Cites Incidents
Kenyon cited the fact that parking
and speeding restrictions on Uni
versity avenue to the bridge and on
Alma street to Mayfield have been
materially lessened.
No member of the safety board
answered this charge.
"Every drug store and restaurant
in town has felt a loss of business
ias a result, of these unnecessarily
I drastic traffic arrests," said Mrs.
: Brink.
Kenyon pointed out that Palo Alto
"has lost over $100,000 worth of
business as a result of this driveâ€”
besides making Palo Alto the laugh
ing-stock of central California."
In deference to queries, Hoy ad
mitted that the drivers that have
been involved in serious Palo Alto
accidents "were all old men" and
not University students.
