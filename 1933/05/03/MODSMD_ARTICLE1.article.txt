# SAFETY BOARD MEMBER FLAYS TRADERS' STAND
## Traffic Body Stands Pat On Drive Against Speed, Parking Violations ARRESTS FALLING OFF Hearing Complaints Will Not Be Considered 
### Jay Graves 
Accusations and counter-accusa
tions flew thick and fast yesterday
and personalities were dragged into
"the discussion resulting from a
heated hearing Monday night before
the Palo Alto Safety Board at which
prominent merchants criticized the
board's handling of the local traffic
problem.
Andrew Hoy, member of the
Safety Board, emphatically de
clared that "we are not going to
consider these complaints at all."
The Safety Board was still stand
ing pat last night in its program to
lid the city of speeders as Dr. Har
vey Slater, chairman, pointed out
that "Our course will not be a bit
different than it has been in the
past because of the hearing."
"Back watering"
Glenn Kenyon, druggist, Monday
night accused the Safety Board of
"backwatering" in their drive
against parking rule violators and
speeders on University avenue and
Alma street.
"We haven't backwatered," shot
back Hoy at the hearing.
Hoy yesterday reiterated this over
the telephone.
Merchant Contradicts
Close upon the heels of this came
a declaration by a prominent Palo
Alto merchant that Hoy had re
cently admitted to him in his store
that "we have had to ease up on
the restrictions which we laid down
at first governing speed on Uni
versity avenue and Alma street."
"I didn't admit anything of the
kind," was Hoy's heated rejoinder
when lie wa sasked to confirm this
statement.
However, Captain Jesse W. Glo
ver, third member of the Board,
yesterday afternoon admitted that
"arrests in Palo Alto are falling off
materially." He credited this to the
widespread publicity which the
campaign has received.
Outsiders Behaving
Glover opined that "outside peo
ple are behaving better since the
start of the campaign."
"Such complaints as were pre
sented at Monday's meeting arc
unjust and unwarranted from
start to finish," declared lloy.
"We are only carrying out the
ordinances and we are not going to
do anything about the hearing. The
only people who are making trouble
for us are the Stanford students."
"Regulations Not Serious"
Dr. Slater contended that the
parking restrictions which the Board
has adhered to are "not serious."
Hoy noted that "if people can't
park within the white lines they
haven't any right to drive." He
pointed out that "only one or two
merchants attended the safety
hoard meeting in reference to the
traffic problem."
A check yesterday revealed that
the majority of the merchants pres
ent at the meeting were there in
silent approval of the accusations
voiced by Kenyon and Mrs. R. F.
Brink.
Kenyon last night slated: "It is
unfortunate that the Stanford
Daily's article has led one member
of the Board of Safety to feel that

Ihc matters under discussion are
personal. Our differences are re
garding policy only, and, as • the
Board disagrees, the matter is tem
porarily closed as far as I am con
cerned.
"I)r. Slater and Captain (Hover

concerned and it is hoped that
Mr. Hoy may take a different at
titude in the future."

the Palo Alto Safety Board at which
prominent merchants criticized the
board's handling of the local traffic
problem.
Andrew Hoy, member of the
Safety Board, emphatically de
clared that "we are not going to
consider these complaints at all."
The Safety Board was still stand
ing pat last night in its program to
lid the city of speeders as Dr. Har
vey Slater, chairman, pointed out
that "Our course will not be a bit
different than it has been in the
past because of the hearing."
"Back watering"
Glenn Kenyon, druggist, Monday
night accused the Safety Board of
"backwatering" in their drive
against parking rule violators and
speeders on University avenue and
Alma street.
"We haven't backwatered," shot
back Hoy at the hearing.
Hoy yesterday reiterated this over
the telephone.
Merchant Contradicts
Close upon the heels of this came
a declaration by a prominent Palo
Alto merchant that Hoy had re
cently admitted to him in his store
that "we have had to ease up on
the restrictions which we laid down
at first governing speed on Uni
versity avenue and Alma street."
"I didn't admit anything of the
kind," was Hoy's heated rejoinder
when lie wa sasked to confirm this
statement.
However, Captain Jesse W. Glo
ver, third member of the Board,
yesterday afternoon admitted that
"arrests in Palo Alto are falling off
materially." He credited this to the
widespread publicity which the
campaign has received.
Outsiders Behaving
Glover opined that "outside peo
ple are behaving better since the
start of the campaign."
"Such complaints as were pre
sented at Monday's meeting arc
unjust and unwarranted from
start to finish," declared lloy.
"We are only carrying out the
ordinances and we are not going to
do anything about the hearing. The
only people who are making trouble
for us are the Stanford students."
"Regulations Not Serious"
Dr. Slater contended that the
parking restrictions which the Board
has adhered to are "not serious."
Hoy noted that "if people can't
park within the white lines they
haven't any right to drive." He
pointed out that "only one or two
merchants attended the safety
hoard meeting in reference to the
traffic problem."
A check yesterday revealed that
the majority of the merchants pres
ent at the meeting were there in
silent approval of the accusations
voiced by Kenyon and Mrs. R. F.
Brink.
Kenyon last night slated: "It is
unfortunate that the Stanford
Daily's article has led one member
of the Board of Safety to feel that

Ihc matters under discussion are
personal. Our differences are re
garding policy only, and, as • the
Board disagrees, the matter is tem
porarily closed as far as I am con
cerned.
"I)r. Slater and Captain (Hover
can he trusted to he fair to all
concerned and it is hoped that
Mr. Hoy may take a different at
titude in the future."
Accusations and counter-accusa
tions flew thick and fast yesterday
and personalities were dragged into
"the discussion resulting from a
heated hearing Monday night before
