# First 150 Encina Dance Bids Sold, More Coming
## 
### 
With the Encina Formal coming
Friday, all bids of the original 150 J
have been sold out, Bill Drew,
dance chairman, announced last
night. Seventy-five more bids will
go on sale immediately, but pro
grams will not be included iri the
$2 asked for these bids as extra
printing could not be secured.
Furniture was moved back into
the renovated Encina Lobby today.
The room is now cream-colored,
eelotex-plastered (sound deadening
effect); and the floors completely !
scraped and refinished.
The front side of the room, once
marred by four arched opening onto
the stairs where peeping roughs;
bothered the more ambitious
"queeners" among their ranks, is
now one solid wall.
Craig's Cardinals, campus favor
ites of a few years ago, return this
Friday. : *
