# Campus Intake Of Beans Saves $100
## 
### 
With all fraternities, all the clubs,
and half the sororities heard from,
the second day of the Convalescent
Home Drive netted $1338.04, General
Treasurer Herb Sanderson said last
night.
The bean lunches that the cam
pus ate yesterday brought in about
a hundred dollars more, Chuck
Otis, general chairman, added, with
Encina and Roble yet to report.
Complete reports from both men's
and women's dormitories are not
yet in. Off-campus residences and
miscellaneous campus units are con
tributing more heavily than ex
pected, Sanderson said, and com
plete returns are expected to be
high.
Ike Livermore, father of the
"Beans for Babies" idea, reports
that reception of his Bean Lunch
was more successful than he had
expected. "The campus may not
have liked the Beans alone," he said
last night, "but in a cause like this,
they ate 'em up."
Plans have been completed, Otis
said, for tonight's jolly-up following
Labor Day activities. It will be held
from 7 to 9 o'clock in the Pavilion,
and true jolly-up prices—a dime a
person, or twenty cents a couple—
will make the affair an appropriate
one.
Music will be contributed by A1
Rushton's Iloyal Cardinals, who are
donating a 10-piece orchestra. All
profits naturally go to the Conva
lescent Home.
