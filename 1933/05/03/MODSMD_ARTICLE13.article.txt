# BOURBONS STOP G.O.P. PLAN TO HALT INFLATION
## Monetary Section Passage Sure; Farm Measure Confab Planned 
### 
WASHINGTON. May 2 (/-P)—The
powerful Democratic majority bat
tered down two desperate Repub- ;
lican attempts to block House con
sideration today of the administra
tion's farm relief-inflation bill and
prepared to approve the currency
expansion section tomorrow before 1
sending the legislation to conference.
Overwhelming approval of pro- j
ccdure for consideration of the
measure assured adoption of the
inflation section. The farm hill to
which it is attached then will he !
sent to conference for the com- i
position of differences between :
the Senate and House.
Bourbons Win Test
The first important test on the i
inflation provision came after the j
Democratic leadership had been
blocked again by Representative
Snell of New York, Republican |
leader, in an attempt to get unani- j
mous consent to debate the pro- "
posal for six hours and then vote |
on the inflation issue. The Demo- '
crats then offered and obtained
overwhelming adoption of a reso
lution to confine debate to live
hours.
After an hour of healed debate in
which Republicans described the in
flation proposition as dangerous'
legislation, and said it would make
President Roosevelt a dictator, the
resolution was adopted, 261 to 113,
on a record vote.
The strength displayed by the ad
ministration followers in this vote
made certain adoption of the cur- !
rency expansion amendment.
Claim Illegality
The Republicans, led by Repre
sentative Treadway, Massachusetts, |
presented a resolution contending
the Senate exceeded its constitu- j
tional authority in originating the
inflation rider. He said that under i
the constitution all revenue and ap
propriations measures must be in
itiated in the House. Representative
Byrns of Tennessee, Democratic
leader,, moved to table the resolu- j
tion. Byrns' motion was adopted,
170 to 51. Republican attempts t<»
force a roll call were overruled by j
Speaker Rainey.
