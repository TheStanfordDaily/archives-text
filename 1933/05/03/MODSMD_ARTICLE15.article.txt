# Mail Admits 3.2, But Not For Campus
## U.S. to Aid Brewers with Beer Deliveries 
### 
The United States mail service
will soon aid the brewery delivery
systems by admitting 3.2 beer to
the mailsâ€”but not in Palo Alto
nor on the campus.
Postmasters William C. Werry and
A. 11. Wheeler received notification
to this effect embodied in an amend
ment to postal laws and regulations.
Deliveries will not be made in
Palo Alto nor 011 the campus,
Wheeler pointed out, because em
bodied in the orders is a clause
prohibiting it in sections of the
nation where beer cannot legally
be sold.
Meanwhile, Arnold Rumweil, city
attorney, today declared that he
"considered the Palo Alto beer le
galization fight closed insofar as any
moves to legalize beer through the
courts was concerned."
Both he and Attorney Adron
Beene were agreed that the /natter
would eventually come to a vote of
the people of the city.
Beene said he hoped to have the
election held before the legislature
convenes in extra session in July.
