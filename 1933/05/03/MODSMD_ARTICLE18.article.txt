# Sheridan Sketched As Lover, Duelist, Writer
## 
### James Sandoe 
The career of Richard Brinsley
Sheridan, author of "The Critic, or
A Tragedy Rehearsed,'' to be read
on Thursday evening by Sword and
! Sandals, was as brilliant as it. was
| unbelievable.
To paraphrase James Branch Ca
j bell, he arrived in Bath at twenty,
| possessing good looks, impudence,
I and a translation of Arisaonct us.
| With these assets he dazzled polite
i society at the fashionable resort,
and eloped audaciously to Paris
I with the belle »>f Bath.
Returning to England he lought
! two frollicking duels with one of
I his outwitted rivals, inviting the
j offended gallant to sup with himself
| and Elizabeth Linley Sheridan be
| fore the encounter.
His life continued in this inered
| ible manner for some sixty years,
! as brilliant in politics as in love
l making. He lost the favor of the
Prince of Wales by a gallant if un
advised gesture, and died almost as
J creditors moved him out of his

house. He had dazzled all the men
of his time, even winning an ad
mission of admiration from the dis- i
grunt led Burke.
As a playwright he ha.s survived
longer than as a politician and j
speech-maker. "The Rivals" and
"The School for Scandal" arc re
vived almost every season by some
aging actress wilh a long reputa
tion.
These plays now seem delightful
but perhaps a little archaic in the
light of the twentieth century, and
frequent bad production ha.s not !
enhanced Iheir virtues. But it is in
the "Critic," for some obscure rea
son, unknown at present, thnt j
Sheridan is found at his most out
rageous. The play is a broad but
wicked jab of the wit's pen at arti- |
filial tragedy, particularly at that
of John Dryden. But although di
rected at a particularly dead school
of playwriting, it lives roaringly on
as a hilarious and bouncing satire
upon badly written poetic plays and
declaiming actors.
