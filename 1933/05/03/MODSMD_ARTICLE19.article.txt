# TWO STARS ILL AS TRACKSTERS PRIME FOR S.C.
## Hables Laid Up With Cold, Joins Here Laborde In P.A. Hospital GUS MEIER DOES 14.7 Sammy Eastman Runs Best Half-Mile Of Year 
### Francis Hamilton 
Fast-stepping Les Hables, who
ran (he Trojan sprinters into the
ground two weeks ago, unobtru
sively entered the Palo Alto Hos
pital yesterday. His ailment was
pronounced as nothing more than a
bad cold, and hospital treatment was
prescribed as a safeguard for his
condition Saturday, when the Car
dinals visit Los Angeles to enact the
second part of their track duel with
Southern California.
In company with Ilablcs was
Here La horde, who returned to
the hospital with a bronchial in
fection. Labordc, described as be
ing in poor condition, spent last
week in a hospital bed, and was
released Sunday.
Eastman Shows Form
The bright spot of yesterday's
time trials were performances by
â€¢'Brother" Sam Eastman and Gus
Meier. Eastman, bidding for a place
on Saturday's entry list, stepped
through the best half-mile run on
Angell Field this year when he led
teammates Murphy, Naylon, and
Ferric to the tape in 1:57.8. Meier,
back in his best form since his
muscle injury, incurred before the
Big Meet, raced through a flight of
high hurdles in 14.7.
Weather conditions were not fa
i vorable, and Frank Lombardi fa
| vored his legs in a hundred-yard
dash with A1 Blackmail. Blackmail
shaded hini to (he tape in 10.1, and
Itook the 220 in 22.2. Cotto Herbert
found no contest in the low hurdle.,
and was content with 24.4.
Vaultcrs Still Bad
The weight men, with the excep
tion of Laborde, are in excellent
condition, and Nellie Gray appears
completely recovered from the
muscle injury which hampered his
work before the first Trojan meet.
Vaultcrs Bill Miller and Bud
Deacon are still in questionable
condition. Neither has had any
work since the California meet,
if the few jumps against S.C. are
excepted. Deacon is working hard
to revive his leg muscles, but
Miller's injured heel is proving
recalcitrant.
