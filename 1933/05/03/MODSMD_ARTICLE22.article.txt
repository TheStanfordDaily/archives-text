In common willi Amherst, Berkeley, and every other
college town in America, Palo Alio is in the throes of con
troversy over M.2 per cent beer, with the students making
common cause willi the town restaurateurs and demand
ing the right to drink it.
The News recently expressed I he. hope thai some uni
versity administration somewhere in America would have
the courage lo experiment willi that dangerous, distrusted,
and greatly praised tiling called freedom and see how col
lege students would behave when the lure of Ihe forhiddeil
was removed from mild intoxicants.
Now comes < B. Lastreto with a letter lo Ihe Palo Alto
Times directing a challenge lo Stanford University. What
lie says is worth quoting:
"I read that 'Stanford University will oppose all at
l< mpls lo n move Ihe mile and a half restriction to permit
Ihe sale of innocuous beer.' lint I say that the univer
sity in its intent lo guide ils students to temperate habits,
and I add. civilized customs, should on the contrary fa
vor Ihe consumption of at least wine and beer. You
can'l leach one lo save himself from drowning by keeping
Iliin dry. . . ."
.Mr. Laslrelo's words are worth thinking about. Must
America go on forever treating ils citizens and its college
students like children who cannot be trusted lo choose
good from evil and wisdom from folly?
lias Oxford's prestige as a university suffered because
ils students can gel all Iho beer they want bv crossing the
street? Stanford's official motto is "Die Luf't dcr Frciheit
vveht." Why not let it blow? San Francisco Xcws
