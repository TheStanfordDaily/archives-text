to point at him with 'reference to a little tiff between John
No barleycorn"" Law and the business men down in Palo
Alto. The erstwhile hero of the merry game of heating the
Paly cops, in his momentary emergence from a long re

In Ihe "Campus Opinion'" this morning is printed a
querulous and none 100 complimentary letter which will

ol the teller waxed enthusiastic once he got under way and
accused his favorite newspaper of prevaricating or being
duped.
Space, lime, and inclination do not permit a complete
answer ol Ihe charges made by Ihe "Campus Opinion"
contributor. The Daily can only reiterate that it possessed
sullicient evidence to back up the charges made through
"i\ir. Smith, that il was prepared to present this evidence
