\\ lif 11 Ihe 1 1 c\s s \\;is Hashed from \\ ashington yesterday
all ci'iioon that Ihc ollicc of Ihc Postmaster - General ha<l
advised <ill poslmasters llial beer in Ihc future can Ik;
<h livcred through I lie mails, a roscalc visln was called up.
Ilccr <!' livcred in Ihc post ollicc, Ihc building redeco
rated on bicr-gartcn lines, an extra-size refrigerator in
siallcd, Ihc stamp and registry olliccs replaced by a Iree
lunch counter i-l seemed too good to he true.
I 1 was. Attache*! to the Washington order was a pro
vision excluding communities in which the sale of beer is
prohibited. Neither I'alo Alto nor t Diversity consumers
el beer will be able to gel Iheir Milwaukee and St. Louis
brew by mail.
llul Ihe scenes called up by Ihc idea arc entrancing, at j
least. IMcturc it:
On warm noon-davs, students gather at the post otlicc I
lor Iheir sudsy mail. In Ihc corner, "where Ihc registry and
stamp window's arc now, stands a gleaming mahogany bar,
with open-face sandwiches and bowls of pretzels in close
set rows.
It s cool and airy. Ihc ceiling is painted to represent a
t;i ecu-lea lied orchard, and over Ihe iree-luuch counter
Italics n pai â– ) I ing ol Mae West. C.lerks, wearing white |
aprons ami moustaches, are singing Ihc melancholy C.er
nian drinking songs; behind some palms, where the wall
sluts arc now, a siring orchestra plays softly.
"Don't wake me up just let me dream."
