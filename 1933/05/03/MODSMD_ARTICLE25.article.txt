# BULL SESSION
## A 						DODO IN OUR MIDST 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
Little Speak Softly has spoken—
but unfortunately in last month's
Chaparral. Unfortunately, for peo
ple pay less attention to the Chap
arral than they do to the Daily,
since as yet, we haven't swung any
national elections to speak about.
However, this time Chaparral's In
dian boy doesn't speak softly; he
speaks very harshly. He gives the
Rally Committee the bird—he gives
them «t whole herd of birds—aviary
and all; but they probably don't
know it.
They never will know it, because
the Indian Lad is lunny, and they
think he is just having his fun in
(he good wholesome Chaparral way.
They think the truth can't be funny;
but that is because they never look
in a mirror. That doesn't mean that
the personnel of the present Rally
Committee is horrible. On the con
trary, they are a good crowd (as
crowds go) and are to be coin
mended for their excellent handling
of the Masque Ball. But the idea of
having a Rally Committee i.s the
horrible thing.
The whole attempt to lather up
the campus into a frenzy of enthu
siasm for a football game is of
course unnecessary. If the spirit
isn't there, naturally there i.s no
need to worry. Furthermore, if it
isn't there, the Rally Committee
won't be able to create it. The very
fact that people come to a Rally
shows they are imbued with that
nebulous catch-all, "Spirit." The
Rally is just another evening's di
version—a chance for some alumni
to show they still LOVE their Alma
Mater—and usually pretty poor di
version at that.
The other major function of the
Rally Committee is to organize the
rooting section. This i.s the piece de
lesistance of the whole year. And
why must we scream and act in
unison like so many trained chim
panzees on strings? Of course, I
like a rooting section —an opportun
ity for reasonably priced seats and
the association of my classmates.
But further than that, it's pretty
foolish. Being young, healthy, and
vigorous (except for eight o'cloeks
on Saturday morning), I like to yell
?.t a game. But why not let us yell
when we want to yell? Five min
utes after a guard comes out to tell
the coach that U.S.C. is running
through his position, we are ex
pected to give a "four," though most
of the stands are in favor of a
"three," notwithstanding an ever
present minority who hold out for
the "six." By half-time, most of the
students aren't yelling at all.

The card stunts, according to the
pictures in the following SundayV
papers, must be inspiring messes,
But every time we tear our card;
v/e are tossing $100 to the winds,

That's not much, but that plus
sweaters and caps means an annual
expense of hundreds of dollars for
the support of the Rally Committee.
Spending money to maintain an
annoying and persistent itch cn the
back of the student body is futility
at its best.

However, this time Chaparral's In
dian boy doesn't speak softly; he
speaks very harshly. He gives the
Rally Committee the bird—he gives
them «t whole herd of birds—aviary
and all; but they probably don't
know it.
They never will know it, because
the Indian Lad is lunny, and they
think he is just having his fun in
(he good wholesome Chaparral way.
They think the truth can't be funny;
but that is because they never look
in a mirror. That doesn't mean that
the personnel of the present Rally
Committee is horrible. On the con
trary, they are a good crowd (as
crowds go) and are to be coin
mended for their excellent handling
of the Masque Ball. But the idea of
having a Rally Committee i.s the
horrible thing.
The whole attempt to lather up
the campus into a frenzy of enthu
siasm for a football game is of
course unnecessary. If the spirit
isn't there, naturally there i.s no
need to worry. Furthermore, if it
isn't there, the Rally Committee
won't be able to create it. The very
fact that people come to a Rally
shows they are imbued with that
nebulous catch-all, "Spirit." The
Rally is just another evening's di
version—a chance for some alumni
to show they still LOVE their Alma
Mater—and usually pretty poor di
version at that.
The other major function of the
Rally Committee is to organize the
rooting section. This i.s the piece de
lesistance of the whole year. And
why must we scream and act in
unison like so many trained chim
panzees on strings? Of course, I
like a rooting section —an opportun
ity for reasonably priced seats and
the association of my classmates.
But further than that, it's pretty
foolish. Being young, healthy, and
vigorous (except for eight o'cloeks
on Saturday morning), I like to yell
?.t a game. But why not let us yell
when we want to yell? Five min
utes after a guard comes out to tell
the coach that U.S.C. is running
through his position, we are ex
pected to give a "four," though most
of the stands are in favor of a
"three," notwithstanding an ever
present minority who hold out for
the "six." By half-time, most of the
students aren't yelling at all.

The card stunts, according to the
pictures in the following SundayV
papers, must be inspiring messes,
But every time we tear our card;
v/e are tossing $100 to the winds,

That's not much, but that plus
sweaters and caps means an annual
expense of hundreds of dollars for
the support of the Rally Committee.
Spending money to maintain an
annoying and persistent itch cn the
back of the student body is futility
at its best.
Little Speak Softly has spoken—
but unfortunately in last month's
Chaparral. Unfortunately, for peo
ple pay less attention to the Chap
arral than they do to the Daily,
since as yet, we haven't swung any
national elections to speak about.
