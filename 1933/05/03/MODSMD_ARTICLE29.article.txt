CHRISTOPHER STRONG (Radio)
—At the Stanford Theatre.
It is useless now to exeorciate
Hollywood for its poisonous habit
of forcing stars into vulgar and
trivial vehicles; the habit is as fixed
: as it is lamentable. And so I .should
allow Christopher Strong to pass
without comment were it not for the
amazing remarks of Mr. Mordaunt
Hall, cinemacritic of the New York
Times.
Mr. Hall finds the picture to be
"a gratifying example of the for
ward strides made in motion pic-
Kires since the linking of micro
phone with camera." And he con
tinues further to hang upon it the
heaviest and most magnificent series
of adjectives that ever graced dis
mally inferior piece of work. The
tact that Mr. Hall is content to
make these observations without
supporting them seems not to bother
him at all.
He can hardly pretend to find
merit in the plot itself. The story is
I a hopelessly vulgar series of mental
orgasms, motivated by a number
of characters who teeter between a
modern "freedom," an almost me
dieval concept of honor, and a
startling prudishne.ss which arises
from them. The vacillations of this
unadmirable group foment the sun
dry turns of the plot, rendering it
cheap and unbelievable melodrama.
How, in the face of such technical
difficulties Mr. Hall can assert that
the players give amazingly natural
> performances, must remain a mys
tery. To be sure, Katherine Hep
burn, who has the only consistent
| role in the film, by her enormous
personal power and peculiar ease,
does, by superior playing, give the
film what few touching moments it
possesses. But the rest of the cast is
decidedly not natural—largely be
cause of the absurd characters they
play.
Mr. Hall apparently finds some
miraculous directorial and produc
tional innovation in the fielm. I can
see no advance in photography and
the only faint technical improve
ment is the indication of passing
time during a world-circling flight
through the medium of newspaper

headlines. The device is no more
than a smooth application of an old
trick and, in addition, fails to build
to the proper intensity by its de
pendence upon objects rather than
persons: newspaper headlines in
stead of personalities. In addition,
the trick used in this manner must
necessarily be so rapid that it fails
of its own objective: to show the
characters in a period of danger.
The film is no more than i par
ticularly sad example of strangula
tion of worthy material. If Bank
head, Bennett, and Company cannot
last after having built reputations
(on what I cannot imagine), how

can Miss Hepburn, compelled so
early into such a film as this one,
be expected to make more than the
first strides toward the essential
and sacred shrine, the box oflice?
Or to demonstrate or develop her
unquestionable powers? —Sandoe

: as it is lamentable. And so I .should
allow Christopher Strong to pass
without comment were it not for the
amazing remarks of Mr. Mordaunt
Hall, cinemacritic of the New York
Times.
Mr. Hall finds the picture to be
"a gratifying example of the for
ward strides made in motion pic-
Kires since the linking of micro
phone with camera." And he con
tinues further to hang upon it the
heaviest and most magnificent series
of adjectives that ever graced dis
mally inferior piece of work. The
tact that Mr. Hall is content to
make these observations without
supporting them seems not to bother
him at all.
He can hardly pretend to find
merit in the plot itself. The story is
I a hopelessly vulgar series of mental
orgasms, motivated by a number
of characters who teeter between a
modern "freedom," an almost me
dieval concept of honor, and a
startling prudishne.ss which arises
from them. The vacillations of this
unadmirable group foment the sun
dry turns of the plot, rendering it
cheap and unbelievable melodrama.
How, in the face of such technical
difficulties Mr. Hall can assert that
the players give amazingly natural
> performances, must remain a mys
tery. To be sure, Katherine Hep
burn, who has the only consistent
| role in the film, by her enormous
personal power and peculiar ease,
does, by superior playing, give the
film what few touching moments it
possesses. But the rest of the cast is
decidedly not natural—largely be
cause of the absurd characters they
play.
Mr. Hall apparently finds some
miraculous directorial and produc
tional innovation in the fielm. I can
see no advance in photography and
the only faint technical improve
ment is the indication of passing
time during a world-circling flight
through the medium of newspaper

headlines. The device is no more
than a smooth application of an old
trick and, in addition, fails to build
to the proper intensity by its de
pendence upon objects rather than
persons: newspaper headlines in
stead of personalities. In addition,
the trick used in this manner must
necessarily be so rapid that it fails
of its own objective: to show the
characters in a period of danger.
The film is no more than i par
ticularly sad example of strangula
tion of worthy material. If Bank
head, Bennett, and Company cannot
last after having built reputations
(on what I cannot imagine), how

can Miss Hepburn, compelled so
early into such a film as this one,
be expected to make more than the
first strides toward the essential
and sacred shrine, the box oflice?
Or to demonstrate or develop her
unquestionable powers? —Sandoe

It is useless now to exeorciate
Hollywood for its poisonous habit
of forcing stars into vulgar and
trivial vehicles; the habit is as fixed
: as it is lamentable. And so I .should
