A YARN ON OUR
HONORED PRESIDENT
Stories of the past S.C. track meet
Mill come filtering iri through the
crack under the Daily office door.
This one concerns one Ray Lyman
Wilbur, Sr., President of Stanford
University and former Secretary of
Labor.
A l thitl track meet, a long line
had formed in front of 1 he* ticket
booths due to an attempt at econ
omy on the purl of the 8.A.C.; the
Board expected a smaller crowd and
tried lo conserve on help. Al the far
end of the string of humans who
were waiting patiently and impa
tiently, depending on their nature,
Id pay the government lax on their
complimentary tickets stood Presi
dent Wilbur.
With a sigh of relief. Dr. Wilbur at
Fast reached (lie little window and
removed coin from his pocket
with which to paj the (ax. As in
laid ("he money on the counter,
Dr. Wilbur said:
"Quite a bother, (his government
tax, isn't it?"
And the adroit ticket-checker
came right back:
"Yes, it is. The Republicans passed
Ihe law, didn't they?"
Dr. Wilbur's answer is not known.
BLACKMAN MAY UPSET
Tin; DOPESTERS
I was speaking with Les 1 tables
Ihe other day, before he returned
to his former beloved haunt, the
Hospital. «
Hablcs, who is an optimist when
he has reason Lo be pessimistic, con
lends that even if McNaughton and
Von O.sdel defeat Schween- -n.it be
cause Schween wil! do less well but
because the Trojans are capable of
heights to which Schween is simply
physiologically unable to soar as yet
—Stanford will triumph. And among
his feature points is the belief that
Al Blackmail may take the experts
for a merry ride while he wins the
quailer from Ablowich and Tomp
kins.
Blackman, if will he remem
bered, ran his first race in big
time competition against U.S.C.
and was pulled out by Warbur
ton. Young Al, with more e\peri
< nee and two weeks more condi
tioning, may live up to the Hablcs
forecast and displease Mr. Crom
well even as did Schween a week ;
am.
