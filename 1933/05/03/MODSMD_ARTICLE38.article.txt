Yesterday the gridders spent a
greater part of the afternoon run
ning over fundamentals. The line
men tackled and blocked the dum
my for about half an hour while the
backs co-ordinated reverses and
spinners. The line-men pushed the
bucking sled around the field for
fifteen minutes.
The backs and ends gathered in
the corner of the field and practiced
pass plays, and at the same time
the tackles, guards, and centers
worked at opening holes with of
fensive and defensive lines opposing
one another.
A short scrimmage culminated the
afternoon's workout in which Coach
Thornhill lined up seven of last sea
son's star freshman players.
Promising Comhinations
One backfield combination com
posed of Reisner and Hamilton at
the halfback post, AfTlerbaugh at
quarter, and Grayson at full, ap
peared powerful and promising.
Another backfield composed of Sim
and Van Dellen at the halves, Tar
ghetta at quarter, and Alustiza at
full looked equally powerful and
promising.
There will be no practice for the
gridders tomorrow, but Thursday
Thornhill intends to hold an inten
sive scrimmage to see how his
youngsters and veterans are pro
gressing.
Minnesota co-eds are liable to a
$10 fine or six days in jail if they
