## 
### Jay Graves 
Whether or not the B.A.C. will
see fit to ptiy the expenses of a
Stanford golf squad from here to
Buffalo, N.Y., to play in the Na
tional Intercollegiate*, will depend
largely upon how hi# Stanford's cut
of the gate receipts of the S.C. track
meet next Saturday amounts to,
Graduate Manager A1 Masters de
clared today.
If Stanford makes a lot of
money this week-end they will
probably be able to send a cham
pionship squad East. If not—it's
another matter.
Coach Eddie Tw?ggs Is confident
that "his boys," whom he has care
fully handpicked for stick-swinging
ability, can take the best the nation
has to offer, if somebody will buy
them a steerage passage East so that
they can get a chance to play.
