# COTTRELL SEES NEW GOVERNMENT
## 
### 
"The revolution in political think- I
ing which we are going through has
forced u.s to look at the results of j
the past unthinking excessive gov-> i
tmrnent," Professor Edwin A. Cot
-11 ell, head of the Political Science
department, told his audience in the j
Little Theatre last night when he j
spoke on the subject, "How Much i
Government?"
"We have overburdened our- '
selves," he said. "There are too
many areas, too many officers, too
many activities. A change in gov
-1 ernment is bound to come."
At the present time Professor :
Cottrell pointed out there are 252,-
000 governmental units in the
United States that are assessing, ;
collecting and spending $9,000,000,000
a year all out of the taxpayers' j
pocket.
"The modern trend in our exist- j
ing forms of government is toward i
integration or centralization. This is '
one of the dangerous factors we are j
facing in governmental activities !
because it is a simple matter to go ;
too far in this connection. The \
executive departments are increas
ing in power at the expense of the
legislative.
"Local governments must be
elastic enough to satisfy the needs
of a growing community," he stated.
"Simple organization, more efficient
operation, and definite located re
sponsibility are necessities of gov
ernmental reform."
