BERLIN, May 2 —Chancellor
Hitler's brown shirts, by surprise
and storm, took the last hurdle to
day on the road to Nazi domination
of the labor movement by occupy
ing headquarters of the free trade
unions throughout Germany.
Socialist leaders of the unions
which have 5,500.000 members, were
arrested.
The trade unions of the future
are to be made national rather than
international in character, Nazi
leaders said.
Labor Leaders Held
Having previously smashed the
Social-Democratic party, the Nazis
realized socialism's > backbone—the
trade unions—still moved mentally
in idealogy of Marxism, even though
leaders tried outwardly to swing
tliem into line with the new con
cept of Germany. t
In Berlin the Nazi storm troops
occupied the national headquarters
of the unions and the gigantic
building of the metal workers'
union.
The Social Democratic party's
few remaining Reichstag and Prus-

! sian Diet members have been lead
ing a shadow-like existence, totally
devoid of the influence which was
theirs when they belonged to the
dominant party in Germany. Their
vast propaganda apparatus, includ
ing hundreds of newspapers, al
ready have been outlawed.
A Nazi communique said that
Germany '"today entered upon the
second epoch of the national social
ist revolution by freeing the worker
from the last fetters of Marxism."
Praises Hitler
"Three months of Nazi govern
ment proves to you workers that
Hitler is your friend, that Hitler
wrestles with the problem of your
freedom, that Hitler supplies you
with bread."
The metal workers' union in Ber
lin has a membership of 827.000 and
is claimed to constitute the largest
single union in the world.
All minor officials and employees
of the unions, it was said, will be
admonished to continue work in ac
cordance with the needs of the na
tional revolution in order that so
cial democracy might definitely be
crushed,
