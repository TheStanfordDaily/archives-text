# FARM CONVALESCENTS WHO BENEFIT TODAY
## 
### 

A sunny corner of the Con
valescent Home where some
of the 70 children are playing,
forgetful of their handicaps.
In these pleasant surround
ings, with medical care,
schooling, and recreation, they
are given a chance to become
healthy, useful citizens. This
opportunity is partly due to
the aid of the Stanford stu
dent body in its annual char
ity drive and its work on La
bor Day. Contributions from
the Masque Ball and campus
athletic events also go toward
realizing the goal set by the
founders of the Home.
