"Plenty of food, a good barbecue,
and some bang-up entertainment,"
are what. Kay Wilbur, Jr., Labor
Day head, sees as the main points
in this afternoon's workout at the
Convalescent Home.
"Let's have everyone dig up some
old clothes and a pair of gloves,"
he said last night, "and get out
there this afternoon to work. Work
starts at 1 o'clock and will con
tinue until 5; there'll be plenty to
do."
Half-Holiday Granted

half-holiday. All afternoon classes
have been called off.
Trucks will be stationed in front
of Encina and Sequoia halls at 1
o'clock for transportation. Any pri
vately ov/ned tools, such as shovels,
rakes, and hoes, which happen to be
lying around fraternity or hall
rooms, will be gratefully received
by the foremen.
"Report for work to the men with
white bands on their arms," Wilbur
urges. "They're the labor commit
tee, and they'll have something for
everyone to do."
