Ut'ii Eastman will probably run \
against U.S.C.
Fickle rumor, dealing a royal j
(lush in its game of toying with
the million-dollar legs of Stan- |
ford's greatest runner, made an- j
other startling about-face yester- i
day with the announcement that !
Captain Hen Bangs may yet enter !
the Trojan meet in the Olympic
Stadium Saturday.
Running easily, and without any
effort to turn on pressure, the in- I
valuable Eastman legs circled the. 1 :

seconds, and then came back to run j
a half-mile in 2:06, good time for'
high-school runners.
"Can Kun," Says Kotli
"Eastman can run if he wants to," j
.said Dr. Fritz Roth, team psysician, j
after watching Eastman stride eas- j

ford trackdom, would make no of- j
ficial comment,, but, his sharp witti- i
ei.sms about lii.s "cripples" and Dean j
Cromwell assumed a much more I
cheerful tone.
Definite announcement was made j
yesterday of the expected tragedy— j
Olympic Champion Bill Miller will j
not vault against American Cham- !
pion Bill Graber. With this sad i
news, Stanford trackmen realized
that they will not win the meet
unless Eastman competes.
The final showdown on Ben's con
dition will come at about 4:30 o'clock
this afternoon.
