# Satire To Be Read Tonight
## "The Critic" Offers Serious Role For Churchill 
### 
Willi Bob Churchill as Lord
Burleigh, his first straight charac
terization, the cast for "The
Critic," to be read tonight at 7:!50
o'clock in the Little Theatre, is
complete. Churchill has had two
major assignments in campus
productions this year, but in to
night's reading he escapes from
the waggish with this difficult
serious role.
The part demands extreme re
serve and extraordinary panto
mime. It Ls the leading role in "the
tragedy rehearsed" by the players
in the latter acts of "The Critic."
Other members of the large cast
include: Robert Brauns as Puff,
James Broughton as Dangle, Myna
Hughes as Mrs. Dangle, Will Wil
liams as Sir Fretful Plagiary. And
in the rehearsal: Marian Jones as
Tiiburina, Andrews Harris as Don
Ferolo Whiskerandos, James Benet
as the Beefeater, Dick Dawson as
the Thames, Carter Meyer as Sir
Christopher Hatton, Bill Drew as
Sir Walter Raleigh.
Mary Ann Crary will be seen
as the Justice's Wife, Eleanor Har
ris as Niece to Sir Walter Raleigh,
Richard Frank as the Undcr-
Pronipter, John Brash as the Con
stable, and Fred Hoffman as a
Sentinel.
Special staging arrangements
are being made as the reading
will be conducted in the manner
of an informal rehearsal, the
players walking through their
roles.
The play, one of the sharpest sa
tires in the English drama, combines
a burlesque which approaches a
slapstick and comedy of the wittiest
type. The most serious problem is
the lifelike reproduction of "the
grand manner" demanded of the
actors; if the actors of the "tragedy"
arc able to imitate this successfully,
the reading should be highly amus
ing, for rehearsals have proved that
Pufl and his associates, as played by
Brauns, Dwan, and Broughton, can
read high comedy well.
The curtain, called for 7:30
o'clock, will rise promptly at that
hctir and latecomers will not be
scaled. Ushers have been provided
to avoid a possibly crowded audi
torium.
