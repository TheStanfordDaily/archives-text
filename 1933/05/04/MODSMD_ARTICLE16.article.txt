### 
TOKYO, May 3 (/P) â€”Japan .shook j
its fist at Chinese locs today in a <
new threat interpreted in non- j
Japanese quarters as an attempt to j
frighten the Chinese into seeking an j
armistice.
A government spokesman declaimed '
that if the army is compelled to re- j
peat recent operations in North
China they will "probably be on a
larger scale than heretofore, re
quiring special sanction of the Em- i
peror."
When he was asked if this
meant occupation of Peiping and
Tientsin, he said it was impossible
to fix limits.
"It is up to the Chinese," he said, |
adding with a laugh that the Japa
nese might go as far as Canton. i
Meanwhile, at the Foreign Office,
a spokesman declared it was almost j
a certainty that Japan would de- I
mand naval equality with the United j
States and Great Britain in the i
1935 naval conference.
"Even Germany," he said, "is |
demanding equality in armaments, j
and there is no reason Japan, !
which never has been defeated in
war, should accept a position of
naval inferiority."
The promotion of General Nobu
yoshi Muto, commander in chief of
the Japanese armies in Manchuria,
ti (he rank of Field Marshal was j
announced today.
WASHINGTON, May 3 The
State Department today announced
i) had been officially informed thai
th ) principle of the "open door" in
Manchuria would bo strictly main
tained and that a Manchukuoan
.spokesman who gave a contrary im
pression recently spoke without;
authority.
