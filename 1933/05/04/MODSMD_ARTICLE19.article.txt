GRAND TOTAI $1697.75
WITH the Convalescent Home Drive totals within halt an inch of $1700
last night, and with additional contributions expccted to send the sum
over the $1850 mark, student heads of the campaign expressed themselves
as "well satisfied." General Chuck Otis said: "Considering students' finan
cial condition this year, it seems to me that the contributions have been
unusually heavy—better than we really expected. Stanford has shown
that the Convalescent Home tradition is still supported."
Last night's figures showed a total of $1(»})7.75 in the treasury, as the
15)33 drive officially closed. Complete returns from Bean Day, the Labor
♦ Day jolly-up, and three sororities

were still to come in.
