# "Hawk Island" a Lesson In Practical Political Science
## 
### 
In spile of what political scientists tell us of the delimit
trend toward greater centralization in government and tin
advantages of such integration, the currently uppernios
political theory appears to have very real limitations, ii
so far ;is student "government" is concerned. With lh<
gliosis of incompetence and indifference hovering in tin
background, student executive circles here at Stanford fre
quenllv demonstrate the undesirable results which inte
grated authority may achieve.
The latest demonstration was completed when the cur
lain fell upon "Hawk Island" in the Assembly Hall las
Friday night. Not content with the way in which tin
Dramatic Council was minding its own business, the K?
Committee decided to take matters more or less into it;
own hands. The members selected the play to be presentet
and spent two or three long evenings planning how the>
were going to put the spring quarter dramatic produetioi
across. This the Kx Committee did in perfectly good faith
Still, in good faith, Ihe student executive body provet
itself incompetent and indifferent. The committee mem
bers selected an inferior play, not the top choice of the
Dramatic Council, llien hacked out of the picture, failing
to "put across" the production as they had intended am
as Ihe council had expected. And there was the Dramatic
Council, faced with Ihe problem of producing a play no
particularly to ils liking, and obligated to produce a pla\
at once artistic and financially successful.
"Ilawk Island" told ils own story. Not a success tit the
box otlice, the play was regarded as a poor choice by flu
audience, and Ihe production was generally conceded l<
rank low in Ihe list of Stanford stage hits. The spriiu
quarter dramatic activity had been hutched, innocenth
enough, by ;m attempt to install integration of authority
as a cure-all for local depression ills. The Daily, whicli
had its linger in Ihe pie as a sympathizer with the Ex
Committee's original intentions, has learned its lesson
Never again will it participate in an attempt to show tin
Dramatic Council how to run its affairs.
