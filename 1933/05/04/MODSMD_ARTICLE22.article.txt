# Another College President Joins Ranks of Reactionaries
## 
### 
When, ;i few venrs ago, an editor of tlie Columbia Spec
tator was expelled from the university, a certain amount
of doubt was cast upon the reality of the allegedly liberal
tendencies of Columbia's administration, beaded by Dr.
Nicholas Murray Butler.
.More speculation has been caused by the recent case of
a Columbia instructor who wanted "reconstruction of the
social order," and who wasn't backward in telling his
classes about it.
He was lired. A mass meeting was held immediately,
;il which the action of the administration was freely criti
cized, not only by students, hul bv two professors. Paren
thetically, this aspect of professors in Ihe role of critics of
the administration seems novel to a campus such as Stan
lord.
Dr. Butler was severely condemned for his move, which
w as thought to be directed against freedom of opinion and
toward conservatism and reaction.
Few American university pro lessors are noted for their
liberal tendencies. Dr. Butler has long been conspicuous
among his colleagues for his apparently sincere individ
ualism, which may, after all, have been due chiefly to his
anti-prohibition sentiments.
It may be that Dr. Butler and his press agent have been
misleading Ihe American public. If this be so. as these two
expulsions at his university would indicate, it is unfortu
nate unfortunate for the advancement of American edu
cation that another college president is revealed as march
ing in Ihe ranks of the reactionaries.
