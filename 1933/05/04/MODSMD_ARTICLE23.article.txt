# Phi Bete Grade Grabbers Get Another Slap—from Kansas, Now
## 
### 
"I know Phi Beta Kappas upon whom I would place no
dependence, and then there are others with average intel-
ligence upon whom I would place all confidence. Souk 1 of!
those in Phi Beta Kappa have good grades and write Span-
ish and French vocabularies because they memorized
them, but they're still dumb."
Thus does R. H. Wheeler, professor of psychology all
the University of Kansas, pay his respects to honor stu-
dents. The professor compares such students to circus ani
mals learning tricks. Giving good grades "is like dangling
a piece of meat before a lion to get him to climb upon a
pedestal; a student sees those grades always before him
and works to get good grades. The best grade-getters are
those who know the professors' pet hobbies and throw
them back at them. They all get excellent grades — but
they're dumb."
The statements made by the Kansas professor are in
line with the argument against grades as set forth in a
letter to the Creightonian (Kansas student publication)
this week. A trifle more forceful perhaps and given to the
use of the vernacular, but the Kansas professor has much
the same idea as the head of the local Progressive Educa-
tional Association: "Grade-getters are apt to be dumb." —
