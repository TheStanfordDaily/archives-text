# Phi Bete Grade Grabbers Get Another Slap—from Kansas, Now

"I know Phi lieta Kappas upon whom 1 would place no!
dependence, and (lien there are others with average inlet-1
licence upon whom I would place all confidence. Souk 1 of!
those in Phi Hcta Kappa have good grades and write Span- i
ish and French vocabularies because lliev memorized
them, but they're slili dumb."
Ilitis does 11. 11. Wheeler, professor of psychology all
the I niversitv ol Kansas, pay his respects to honor stu- ;
dents. The professor compares such students to circus ani
mals learning tricks, (living good grades "is like dangling
a piece of meat before a lion to get him to climb upon a J
pedestal; a student sees those grades always before him!
and works to gel good grades. The best grade-getters are!
those who know the professors' pel hobbies and throw
them back at them. They all get excellent grades hut
they're dumb."
I he statements made by the Kansas professor are in !
line with the argument against grades as set forth in a
letter to the < reighloniau (Kansas student publication)
this week. A Irifle more forceful perhaps and given to the I
use ol the vernacular, but the Kansas professor has much!
the same idea as Ihe head of the local Progressive Eduea- j
tioiial Association: "tirade-getters are apt to be dumb." ~
