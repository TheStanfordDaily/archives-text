# BULL SESSION
## DEPRESSION BRINGS ALL THINGS 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
The election of 1932 was some
thing stupendously different; but
subsequent events show that it was
but an omen in the sky—a gentle
zephyr of the gale that was to come.
That gale has come. But in a cy
clone, a gale passes by completely
unnoticed; and that seems to be
v/hy the cataclysmic changes that
hiive been and are being realized
are nothing but transitory stories
on the front pages—like a new
Garbo disguise or a Los Angeles |
earthquake.
If but one of the half-dozen
things that Roosevelt has done or
ir about to do were even suggested
two years ago, uproarious laughter
would have been the most evident
reaction. The more timid and less
humorous might have shouted "red"
—the newspapers would predict
"political suicide," and that would I
have been the end of the matter.
But now, removed only four years
from 1929, we are acquiescing to
what was unthinkable—outside of
the columns of the "Nation." We
were resigned to prosperity, prohi
bition (i.e., bootleg liquor), and
"Keep Cool With Coolidge" govern
ment. We have lost the first, par
tially nullified the second, and com
pletely overthrown the third. Yet
everyone looks just about the same
as they ever did—and does about
the same things (on a less-expensive
scale).
With a "yes-man" Congress and
a winning smile, Roosevelt is fast
acquiring dictatorial powers—with
out fuss. The chief opposition seems

' to come from broken-down Repub
lican hacks whose sincerity is ques
tioned and William Randolph Ilearst
whose opinions are taken by many
as sure indication of what not to
think. There is little opposition.
The newest proposal—not yot sent
to Congress—is to create federal
control over all vital industries—
including regulation of prices, wages,
and hours of work. The scheme is
1 comprehensive. It puts the control
during the World War in the sand
lot class. This new scheme is Big
League plus; with Roosevelt rt tho
bat all nine innings. The '"Big
Stick" will not be used merely as a
fly-swatter against a few "bad men"
as Teddy used it. It is to become a
bludgeon to beat depression into
prosperity.
If Roosevelt were to take over the
army directly to force hi.s proposals
through to their conclusion, no one
would object particularly. But what
shows the extreme helplessness and
hopefulness of the people is that
Roosevelt can do what he wills
without the army. He does not have
to force his ideas. People accept
(hem. The Chronicle yesterday ran
a cartoon of The President as Atlas
with the globe on his back. That
satisfies most people. They are wil
ling for him to hold the world or
juggle il at his discretion.
When, several years ago, dicta
torial powers in the President and
governmental control of industry
was suggested, I laughed with in
credulity—foolishly.
