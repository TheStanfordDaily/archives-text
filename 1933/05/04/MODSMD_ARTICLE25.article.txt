A SURVEY OF RECORDED
AMERICAN MUSIC: ll.—Carpen
ter and CJrofe.
John Aldcn Carpenter, after years
of obscurity, has recently been ac
corded some of the recognition justly
due him. A Chicago business man,
vice-president of a lumber com
pany, he began musical composition
merely as a hobby, but now his im
portance has justified retirement in
order to devote his full time to
music.
Last year, on commission of the
Washington Anniversary committee,
he wrote the official music of that
celebration, "The Song of Faith,"
for choir, orchestra, and organ. II
was promptly performed on Victor
records by the Chicago A Capella
choir. A work of dignity and gran
deur befitting the subject, it should
remain a permanent addition to the
choral repertoire.
Encouraged by this success, Vic
tor issued Carpenter's modernistic
ballet, "Skyscrapers," which caused
a sensation when first produced at

I the Metropolitan Opera House in
1 192 G. It is an impressionistic work,
picturing American life in the fac
tory and at play, and making fre
i quent use of dissonance. The per
formance by Shilkret and the Vic
tor Symphony orchestra is brilliant,
Victor announces that during the
next few months it will record more
; compositions by Mr. Carpenter, in
cluding his symphonic episode, "Ad
ventures in a Perambulator," and
two songs, "When I Bring You
Color'd Toys" and "Light, My
Light," sung by Rose Bampton.
Ferdie Grofe has also been en
couraged by the recording of sev-
I eral of his works. It will be remem
bered that in 1920 he was the first
to score jazz in symphonic form, and
that he became famous for hi.s or
! chestration of the "Rhapsody in
Elue" for Paul, Whiteman.
Victor recorded, in rapid succes
sion, three of his modern composi
tions, "Three Shades of Blue," the
"Mississippi Suite," and "Metropo
. lis," all played by Paul Whiteman

and his orchestra. This music is
chiefly interesting for its attractive
melodious content and the original
combinations of tone of its scoring.
Of more importance is GroiVJ's
recent work, "The Grand Canyon
Suite." These five-tone pictures are
superbly played on the Victor re
cordings by Paul Whiteman's or
chestra, augmented by members of
the Philadelphia orchestra. It ex
hibits a growing maturity on the
part of the composer and a de
parture from the superficiality which
characterized his earielr work.
