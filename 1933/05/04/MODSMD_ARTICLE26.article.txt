BYRON — Val Cresson, local
rancher, did some lanscaping on his
home grounds and erected an orna
mental tree trunk of concrete. It
was found that the ornament was
sufficiently lifelike to mislead the
woodpeckers, who battered their
bills out of shape trying to pene
trate the solid bark.—S.F. Chronicle.
A woodpecker pecked on a
concrete tree,
Picked and pecked with puny
skill,
Punched and pecked that pesky
pine,
Puffing, puckered up his bill.
Proudly pecked with plucky pep,
Paused—hi.s penetration nil,
Packed more power into his peck—
For all I know, he's pecking still.
