## Women, Men, Hockey Dollars and Fun 
### 
In (he light of historical precedent i
and of the needs of the Student Re
lief Fund and the Convalescent
Home, I beg to advocate a plan for j
the accumulation of the omnipotent!
and elusive dollar that would be !
painless, pleasant ,and profitable.
The scheme, which has been !
tried successfully in the East, is
that of a field hockey game he- j
tween women hockey players and
men football, rugby, or soccer i
stars. A nominal admission charge !
("nominal" is a most handy word; '
i! means quantitatively nothing), j
which would be levied against
athletes participating as well as
spectators would be small to the
payers but would accrue to a large |
amount when all those wishing to
see Row and Roble pulchritude
battle Row and Toy on brawn paid
their dimes or quarters.
In fact, such an idea is so laud- j
able that the B.A.C. guards would i
be glad to contribute their services I
for the afternoon.
