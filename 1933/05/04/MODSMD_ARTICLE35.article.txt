# LET'S BE MODERN; DON'T WRITE, TELEGRAPH
## 
### 
Since this is apparently the day
of the importation to the Golden
Coast of Middle-Western innova
tions, I also suggest that the Stan
ford and U.S.C. freshman track
teams compete in a telegraphic meet,
if not this year, then next spring.
Stanford does not now meet the
Trojan yearlings in track because
of the expense. Which explains,
sadly but still effectively, why
Stanford does not do a large num
ber of things.
But Stanford should meet the
Trojan yearlings, if only because
lecent Indian frosh track teams
have been good and there is there
fore a chance of again swelling the
alma mammy pride of Southern
alumni and Northern alumni un
dergraduates by a victory. And
Stanford can engage in such a meet
—inexpensively and easily—by the
use of that modern convenience, the
telegraph.
Telegraphic track meets are held
between those schools of the West
ern Conference (the Big Ten to you)
that cannot afford to travel. And,
although the thrill of competition
is, I will admit, excluded, still the
meets are successful. —Dick Strouse
