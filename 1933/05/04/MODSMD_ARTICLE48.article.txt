### 

War Glory, a son of Man o' War, is one of the Glen Riddle Farms
Stable's candidates for the KentuckyÂ»derby. If he goes to the post he
will be ridden by Johnny Gilbert, leading jockey of 1932. Out of 11
starts in 1932 he won twice, came in second four times and third once.
His chief triumph was the Walden handicap, mile and one-sixteenth,
at Pimlico, Md. (Associated Press Photo)
