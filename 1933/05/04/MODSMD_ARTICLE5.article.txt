San Francisco's 16-year-old violin- J
ist, in the Pavilion, at 8:20 o'clock j

Menuhin, who began his career
when he was three years old, has
become recognized as one of the
great violinists of the world. Last

hin posseses everything, he lacks
nothing. The revelation started from
the very beginning—a miracle, Mo
zart alive."
Menuhin was born in New York
but has spent most of his life in
San Francisco, where he began his j
musical training on a child's size i
