### 
Led by Jupiter, Dr. Dyment's
Great Dane, the animate of Palo Alto
and Stanford will mew, purr, cluck,
and bark their way down Univer
sity Avenue tomorrow morning in
(he seventh annual pet parade of the
community.
Entries last night included in
numerable dogs and cats, and a
"miscellaneous" group ranging
from turtles to a display of 12
varieties of pigeons. Guinea pigs,
chipmunks, rabbits, chickens, and
ducks will be conveyed in buggies
or express wagons of the local
youth.
Special exhibits registered yester
day were described by their young
owners as being "a cat with the
longest eyelashes in the world," and
another feline bit of allure with the
"loveliest eyes." Another entry's
claim to distinction is "a real Heinz
dogâ€”s7 varieties." Some of the pets
are proud and pedigreed; some boast
that they came from the pound.
Six pet parades without a dog
fight is the record as claimed by
Mrs. Helen Getchell, who is man
aging the event as a Humane So
ciety representative. She says that
the pups love to strut. It is be
lieved that the Scottic dogs will
strut especially proudly this vear,
as they are to parade behind a
real Scotch bagpiper in kilts and
all.
Jupy and his following will go to
the Community House, where pussies,
pups, ponies, and miscellaneous will
be exhibited in their own groupings
and behind screens lo prevent in
tramural wars.
