# Eastman Leaves With Track Team For Trojan Meet
## Stanford May Repeat Win If Eastman Takes 880 Run; Les Hables Slated For Century Victory But Dope Gives Relay To Trojans 
### ALBERT GUERARD, JR 
BKN EASTMAN will leave for Los Angeles tonight on the
Lark, accompanied by twenty-seven other members of the Stanford
track team. In his grip will be a track suit and a pair of spiked shoes.
It he puts those shoes to active use tomorrow afternoon, Stanford has an
even chance of repeating the (>7-64 triumph that astonished the track
world two weeks ago.
Nobody knows if Eastman will face the starter's gun in the Olympic
Stadium—least of all Ben Bangs himself. The great Indian leader, itching
to get one last crack at the grim Trojan in dual meet competition, would

'■stake the remainder of his track
career for a chance to defeat Tro
jans Ferris Webster and Jim Cassin
I in the half-mile.
"Dink" Templeton, twirling his
cane morosely in the dismal atmos
phere of Angell Field yesterday, re
fused to make a final decision. Run
ning stride for stride with invalid
Abe Hables, Eastman loafed through
a 56-second quarter and then rushed
over to get the fateful verdict:
"Shall 1 take my suit to Los An
geles?" Ben asked, poorly con
cealing the eagerness in his voice.
"Sure!"
"Will 1 run?"
"I wish I knew," Templeton
sighed. "I wish I knew!"
If Eastman does run the 880, a
repetition of the pipe dream which
crystallized into a 67-G4 victory 011
April 22 is not inconceivable. But.
die "if" that says the Blond Meteor
I must outdistance his foes in the
half-mile, also demands that the
weakened Abe Hables, one of the
i greatest competitive athletes in
Stanford history, must take at least
1 eight points in the sprints. Chances
are Abe's flying legs will carry him
1 to victory in the 100, but Charley
1 Parsons in the best of health may
have too much endurance for Hables
over the grueling furlong route.
"If' Very Weak
The "if" also points a wavering
finger to sophomore Al Blackmail,
and says: "Take a second in the
, 440!" In much better condition than
he was two weeks ago, Blackman
mny do that very thing. His sinus
trouble has almost disappeared.
Loudly claiming nine points in
the two distance races, dopester "if"
says that Jim Ferric will take the
second in the mile, and unblush
ingly claims six points in the two
mile. "Plueky Phil Morcntin will
win from Dave Foore .... Art
Azcvedo will fight his way to a
1 valuable third." It's a nice thought,
anyhow.
Doped to Win Both Hurdles
A little more dubious in his swecp
ingly dogmatic predictions, "if" pat -
ted Gus Meier and Cotto Herbert
on the backs, and with a quaking
voice told Stanford's ace timber
toppers that they must take eleven
points. (A first for Meier in the
highs, a first and a third for Herbert
! and Gus in the lows.)
Shedding hitter tears the while,
"if" admitted Troy would win Un
rein,y.
Discarding his mantle of optim
! ism, "if" became ultra-conservative
1 at the thought of the field events:
"Put down Schween for a third
in the high jump," he said, showing
thai he put some faith in the tumor ,
that U.S.C.'s Bob Von Osdel soared
6 feet, 8 inches in practice last week,
and that Olympic Champion Mal
colm McNaughton is rounding into
his best form.
"If" conceded fast-improving Gil
belt of Troy a fii'st in the broad
jump, but his face shone happily
as he mentioned Stanford's come
through leapers, Phil Williams, Ed
Lewis, and Paul Zaches. The pole
vault brought tears to "if's" eyes as
the little fellow thought of Bill Mil
ler watching the event from tho
stands. "Six points for U.S.C.' :
''Seventeen points for Stanford
in the weight events, six for the
Indian javelin throwers!" Vague
whisperings from Bovard Field
that U.S.C.'s Houston Harper has
been exceeding 51 feet, were bal
anced by the even more astonish
ing. but definitely true, reports
that Dave Brown has been tossing
the javelin over 200 feet in prac
tice.
With these parting words, "if"
faded sylph-like toward the high
way, a lost soul in search of a rid®
to Los Angele^.
"Stanford <>7. U.S.C. (»4," was his
parting shot.

BKN EASTMAN will leave for Los Angeles tonight on the
Lark, accompanied by twenty-seven other members of the Stanford
track team. In his grip will be a track suit and a pair of spiked shoes.
It he puts those shoes to active use tomorrow afternoon, Stanford has an
even chance of repeating the (>7-64 triumph that astonished the track
world two weeks ago.
Nobody knows if Eastman will face the starter's gun in the Olympic
Stadium—least of all Ben Bangs himself. The great Indian leader, itching
to get one last crack at the grim Trojan in dual meet competition, would

'■stake the remainder of his track
career for a chance to defeat Tro

over to get the fateful verdict:
"Shall 1 take my suit to Los An
geles?" Ben asked, poorly con
cealing the eagerness in his voice.
"Sure!"
"Will 1 run?"
"I wish I knew," Templeton
sighed. "I wish I knew!"

repetition of the pipe dream which
crystallized into a 67-G4 victory 011
April 22 is not inconceivable. But.
