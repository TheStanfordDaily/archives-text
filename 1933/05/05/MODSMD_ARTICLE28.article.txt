# College Birth Control Not at All a Horrid Word
## 
### 
Birth control for American universities has a heretical
sound about if almost as heretical as though contracep
tion were I><• ill for the student instead of the col
lege. I nliiniled democratic education has lon 14 been con
ceded to be one of the cornerstones of American life.
Vet the author of this heresy is the president of mid
western (",oe College, lie told his views Wednesday to the
presidents, deans, and business managers of over liftv uni
versities and colleges of the Mississippi area.
"There is ;i plethora of higher educational institutions
in the I 11 iled States," he said, "and something drastic ought
to be done about it."
(loe's president recommended no specific check, but
pointed to the similarity between banks and colleges.
"Colleges, like other enterprises," he explained, "must
subsist upon a volume of business that has a direct rela
tion to the population, wealth, and business activity of the
community. !l is diflicuit as well as imprudent to •attempt
to drum up business deliberately for the purpose of sup
porting the college. The number of concessions made to
students is the result of competition among an excessive
number of colleges for a limited amount of business."
This departure from time-honored standards is increas
ingly typical of America in these barren years. Old tra
ditions and fetishes are being junked; no new ones, for
tunately, have yet arisen to lake their place.
(Iradualing classes of the last three years have been
aware of the truth of the C.oc president's statement: too
many colleges, 100 many graduates, not enough jobs.
Fewer glorified junior colleges and football factories
is the need of the field of higher education today. Bid of
these, the nation's estimable universities can continue their
service, and fewer graduates will go hungry.
