# Will the Depression Force A Government Controlled Radio System?
## 
### 
The depression seems Id have cut rather decisively into
Hie radio broadcasting business. Many of the large cor
porations which lor years have been using almost unlim
ited lime on the air have found it necessary to shorten or
entirely do away with their programs.
Whether or not this condition will continue to the point
where radio is no longer able to maintain itself remains to
In seen. The radio lias become 100 much of a necessity of
daily life to be allowed to go out completely. If advertising
fails to support il then some other means must be found.
The obvious means of support, and one undeniably
better than the present, is government control. The suc
<â€¢< ss of this plan in Kngland is so well known thai il needs
bttle comment. A small lax on each receiving set supports
Ihe various stations and programs of every kind are pro
duced. Perhaps Ihe idea of no advertising best sums up
Ihe superiority of Ibis system over ours.
II is probably typical of Americans that they are almost
ul one voice in excoriating the ever increasing amount of
radio advertising and yet they have so far failed to look
toward the obvious way of being rid of it. Perhaps thai
much-maligned bogey, Ihe depression, will force the issue.
