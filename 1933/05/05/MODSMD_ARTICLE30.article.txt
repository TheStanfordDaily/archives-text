# Directed Reading a Relief In a Tick-tock University World
## 
### 
I lie Stanford student, in fact any American college stu
(ii-nl. is governed academically by an electric clock system.
I lie licking of a master clock warns him lliat he has two
mimiles to go, a final alarm sends him scampering to his
seal. Some fifty minutes later a general alarm sels him to
shuHling, in the vague hope of silencing a cloek-uneon
scious lecturer. I lie alarm clock awakens him for break
fast or lunch, as the case may he with the individual stu
dent. and the same spring and cog dictator drives him to
hed. several hours too laic.
In such a collegiate atmosphere a course such as Eng
lish, I )ireeled Heading, comes as a welcome relief, a two
unit course which minimizes the time element so far as
( lass periods are concerned. True, the University requires
eight hours' reading per week and regular attendance at
classes, hut the idea of lime is not uppermost in the minds
of section instructor or students. Directed Heading, spoiled
as it is, slightly, by a written code of requirements, never
theless represents the most interesting of all the culture
cultivating courses offered at Stanford to many students
who have taken it.
el many of those same Directed Heading enthusiasts
are quarterly denied the privilege of enrolling in the
course, either because thev have taken it once before or
because they have set their alarm clocks too late on regis
tration morning. A course so diverting and valuable as
Directed Heading should be open to all who care to enroll.
The English Department could bring new hope into the
lives of scores ol clock-bred Stanford students by making
membership in the section groups more easilv available.
