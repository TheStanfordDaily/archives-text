If "Hawk Island" had broken
even, nothing would have beon said.
If it had made $500, we would sus
pect a mistake in addition. But be
cause it lost money, everyone seems
anxious to hang the dead and bleed
ing bird around the other fellow's
neck. It is better known as the old
army game of passing not only the
buck—but the whole goat, odor and
all.
The Ex Committee, it is true, tried
to take a hand in dramatics—but
only because that worthy activity
was about to be swallowed in a sea
of red deficits. If the Ex Committee
has failed, the worst that can bo
said about it is that it is merely
following the Dramatic Council'.,
iead. Assuming the Ex Committee
to have chosen a poor play and
lost money on it, that is no reason
for boosting the Dramatic Council—
which has done equally well in both
respects on some occasions.
But (he joker is that the Dra
matic Council is as responsible for
"Hawk Island" as the Ex Commit
tee. In fact, they are more to blame,
for they an* dramatic experts by
admission; they call themselves the
"Dramatic Council." The Ex Com
mittee is not supposed to know any
better, but the Dramatic Council is.

I If "Hawk Island" was such a hor
rible dramatic choice, why did the
Dramatic Council place it on its list?
Of course, Mr. Samuel French was
selling the rights to this play, but
he probably was selling others as
well.
The Ex Committee, realizing that
"high" art would have to be sul
( lied with rank commercialism
asked the Dramatic Council to nom
inate five plays—one to be a mys
tery. The Council did; and out of
thi> myriad of plays, they chose
"Hawk Island" and four others. That
was not their first choice, but it was
one of their five choices.
They could have realized that the
I Ex Committee was going to select
one of the live. They realized that
any play*placed on that list of five
might be the choice. If they knew
"Hawk Island" was so undesirable,
why take a one out of five chance?
Ii they had been unable to find five
plays, they could have limited their
I recommendations to four—telling
the Ex Committee that they couldn't
think of five plays. It is not a capital
offense to be unable to name five
presentable productions. They would
not even have been ducked in Lagu
nita for their inability.

However, when they, after four
days of deliberation (the request
for suggestions was made March 9;
the suggestions presented March
14), presented the five, the Ex Com
mittee had a right to believe that
; ny one of the five was acceptable.
They choose one of the two mys
teries suggested—each of which
came with the same recommenda
tion from the Dramatic Council.
After all is over, it may be use
less to brand the red letter on any
one. But if fingers are to be pointed,
we can at least use two fingers.
