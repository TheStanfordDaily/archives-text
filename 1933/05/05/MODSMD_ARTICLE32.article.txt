AN HOUR OF MUSIC: Carmen de
Obarrio and Gunnar Johansen.
Tuesday evening Miss Carmen de
Obarrio, assisted by Mr. Gunnar
Johansen, gave a pleasing hour of
music in the Castilleja Chapel. The
Bach Concerto and Fugue in C
Minor, which opened the program,
was intelligently interpreted; al
though Mi.ss Obarrio did not com
pletely master the diminuendi, she
displayed technical skill, without be
coming mechanical, and penetration
into the intricate polyphonic struc- i
ture, especially of the fugue.
Again, she demonstrated a flexible
technique in a Toccata by Paradisi,
a mid-eighteenth century composer;
thus selection, in structure designed
for the harpsichord, was not so
pleasing on the piano as some other
harpsichord writing is. Miss Obarrio
was extremely wise to choose four
Etudes by Neupert, a Scandinavian
of the nineteenth century, rather
than the too-familiar Chopin
studies. In the A Major Etude she
showed a lyrical sense and touch \
which had been absent from her j
other pieces.
The Grieg A Minor Concerto was 1
played by Miss Obarrio and Mr.
Johansen; the two-piano arrange
ment used did not give the soloist
all the opportunities she needed to
contrast her work against a differ
ent medium, an orchestra. Her deli
cate work was constantly over
shadowed by the other pianist's, but
her whole performance was not
greatly inferior to that of Mr. Jo
hansen, who' has to his advantage
maturity and more experience on :
the conceit stage. —Baker
