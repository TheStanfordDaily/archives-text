# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
Certain malicious representations
have been made by alleged "Civil"
Engineers to the effect that they are
certain to win the Engineers' Track
and Field Meet, to be held May 6
at the Engineers' picnic.
We hereby declare that all such
statements are false, misleading, and
boastful, indicating lack of intelli
gence, tact, and conscience on the
part of their makers. We further
more assert that not the Civil En
gineers, but the Electrical Engineers,
are certain to win this great compe
tition.
