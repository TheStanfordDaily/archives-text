## The 						Big Question-Mark? 
### 
"Anything tan happen in tomorrow's Stanford-S.C. track meet. It is
the indefinite meet of the century. Stanford will win an overwhelming
victory; and S.C. will uiii an overwhelming victory. Ben Eastman is in
fine condition and will wirt three races; Ben Eastman has two broken legs
and ha 4 a new kind of wheel-chair. Les Ilahles is faking a slight cold and
has been resting for the anchor lap of the relay: Les Ilahles' sinus makes
a seven months' confinement necessary. Malcolm McNaughton has jumped
six-feet-eight in practice; he is ineligible. Lloyd Schween can repeat;
Schwcen was lucky. And so it goes, rumors, know-nothingness, ques
tioning."
. 4; . 4, <$, <?> <$>
A slight, dark figure flashing past; it's gaining fast; the tape at last.
II runs again—22o now—and wins although it wobbles.
A guy lies sick in bed sans grin; the nurse tunes in: "It's Parson's win."
Which is Hables?
A rangy gent with graceful soar jumps six-feet-four; he could do more:
—The happy victor, smiling, calm, and lean.
A rangy gent needs more than fight; can't reach that height; it's
Trojan's right.
—One must be Schween.
It's .still the high-jump. Come what may, it's Malcolm's d;iy. What does
he say?
The champ enunciates, "It rhymes with 'gotten.'"
Official powers take the stump: "Ineligible, you can't jump. You're not
a champ but just a chump."
They mean McNaughton.
The stands rise up as Big Ben ticks: "You S.C. hicks, back to the sticks."
And Cromwell moans to Dink, "Today's your feast, man."
The Captain sits with buried face. That tortoise pace means Webster's
race,
Or is that Eastman?
In half-mile, shot-put, jav'lin, too, tho thirds come through. Their
points are few,
But help to keep the Trojan total down.
Or do the S.C. stars repeal with Tarzan arms and Nurmi feet to take
those points and calmly beat
Ferrie, Gray, and Brown?
It's five-score now to forty-one. The Injun raced, the Injun won. The
Wooden Horse is dead and done
And ancient, boasting Trojan fame is lore.
The S.C. points accumulate: it's ninety-three to thirty-eight.« Some
thing, 1 guess, the Injun ate.
What is the score?

A slight, dark figure flashing past; it's gaining fast; the tape at last.
II runs again—22o now—and wins although it wobbles.
A guy lies sick in bed sans grin; the nurse tunes in: "It's Parson's win."
Which is Hables?
A rangy gent with graceful soar jumps six-feet-four; he could do more:
—The happy victor, smiling, calm, and lean.
A rangy gent needs more than fight; can't reach that height; it's
Trojan's right.
—One must be Schween.
It's .still the high-jump. Come what may, it's Malcolm's d;iy. What does
he say?
The champ enunciates, "It rhymes with 'gotten.'"
Official powers take the stump: "Ineligible, you can't jump. You're not
a champ but just a chump."
They mean McNaughton.
The stands rise up as Big Ben ticks: "You S.C. hicks, back to the sticks."
And Cromwell moans to Dink, "Today's your feast, man."
The Captain sits with buried face. That tortoise pace means Webster's
race,
Or is that Eastman?
In half-mile, shot-put, jav'lin, too, tho thirds come through. Their
points are few,
But help to keep the Trojan total down.
Or do the S.C. stars repeal with Tarzan arms and Nurmi feet to take
those points and calmly beat
Ferrie, Gray, and Brown?
It's five-score now to forty-one. The Injun raced, the Injun won. The
Wooden Horse is dead and done
And ancient, boasting Trojan fame is lore.
The S.C. points accumulate: it's ninety-three to thirty-eight.« Some
thing, 1 guess, the Injun ate.
What is the score?

"Anything tan happen in tomorrow's Stanford-S.C. track meet. It is
the indefinite meet of the century. Stanford will win an overwhelming
victory; and S.C. will uiii an overwhelming victory. Ben Eastman is in
fine condition and will wirt three races; Ben Eastman has two broken legs
and ha 4 a new kind of wheel-chair. Les Ilahles is faking a slight cold and
has been resting for the anchor lap of the relay: Les Ilahles' sinus makes
a seven months' confinement necessary. Malcolm McNaughton has jumped
six-feet-eight in practice; he is ineligible. Lloyd Schween can repeat;
Schwcen was lucky. And so it goes, rumors, know-nothingness, ques
tioning."
