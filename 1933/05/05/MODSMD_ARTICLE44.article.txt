# HERE'S TO DINK
## LAST SEASON LATERALS TRIED IN GRID PRACTICE 
### Oliver Johnston, Jr Feg Murray, 16 
The Warner lateral pass made its
first appearance last night with a
Thornhill-coached team.
From all outward signs, the lat
erals which were tried out against
the dummies are the same type
which piled up countless yards
for the Big Red Machine last sea
son.
Outside of the laterals Tiny gave
out only straight plays in the chalk
talk this week. From all reports he
is not going to dig up his sleeve
much this spring.

After dummy practice, offensive
backfields and ends were lined up
against defensive tackles and ends.
A noticeable improvement in the
timing of the plays was discern
ible. Only 011 one or two occasions
did the hacks fail to penetrate the
defense. Bones Hamilton and A1
Norgard invariably cleaned out
the tackles for Bobby Grayson.
Stan Anderson, in his first bit of
active work last night, showed that
he has lost none of his kicking abil
ity from lack of practice.
