# Crisis Seen In Summary Of Problems
## Industrial Future Hinges On F.D.'s Solutions 
### Sheridan Hegland 
America this morning stands at
the crossroads.
Socialized control over industry,
drastic restrictions on working
hours, indirect control over wages,
ironclad rules limiting production—
this is one alternative.
Or will industry be permitted to
set its own house in order, and
seek economic recovery under the
time-honored banners of competi
tion and industrial freedom, under,
however, the watchful eye of the
government.
Anti-Trust Laws
Press dispatches last night said
that industrial leaders were ready
(o present to Roosevelt a concrete
proposal in legislative form calling
for liberalization of anti-trust laws
to permit associations linking com
petitors in each line with a govern
ment agency supervising their
agreements.
The United States Chamber of
Commerce is reported as favoring
the legislation. The "New Deal" ad
ministration, however, might stand
ready to assume a more direct con
trol.
This would involve stringent
regulation of employment, wages,
production, and perhaps price
setting. If carried far enough it
would lead to government owner
ship.
Meanwhile in a farmer's conven
tion held in Des Moines a nation
wide food strike was voted unani
mously. Delegates departed for home
"to complete their plans for a blan
ket picket designed to stop all mar
keting."
Railroad Program
In Washington, President Roose
velt's emergency program for the
rehabilitation of railroads was laid
before Congress.
The bill called for the repeal of
the recapture clause, the assumption
(J. - control over railroad holding
companies by the Interstate Com
mete Commission, and the institu
tion bf a federal co-ordinator io force
co-ooeration designed to affect im
mediate economies by avoiding
duplication of facilities, and encour
aging —bankruptcies.
Inflaion meanwhile appeared a
certainty. Although Roosevelt's plans
remain sheathed in mystery, stock
speculators are confidently antici
pating ail expansion, and bu.siness
men generally are held to favor the
move.
These questions present one of
the most dramatic interludes in
industrial history, and their an
swers might well contain within
them influences that will shape
the industrial future.
