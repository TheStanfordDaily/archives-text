Hoover, south of Pescadero.
With a track meet listed r.s the
big event of the day, the engineers
are also scheduled to compete in a
beauty contest as a result of a chal

which will compete for the trophy
donated by Mrs. Hoover are Madi
son Jones, electrical engineers; Art
Kehle, mechanical engineers; Basil
Kantzer, geology and mining; Chuck
