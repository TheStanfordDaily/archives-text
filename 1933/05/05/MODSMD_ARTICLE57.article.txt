# Sheridan Play Pleases Critic
## 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
The brilliant comic lines of Sheri
dan's travesty on heroic tragedy,
"The Critic," were given admirable
treatment last night at the hands
of Sword and Sandals.
Subtlety marks the humor of the
play, but with it is opportunity for
much broad farce; both qualities
were made the most of by the read
ers-performers. The innovation of
going through the action proved
well-adapted to this play and con
siderably heightened its effect.
Outstanding were Robert Brauns
and Robert Dwan in major roles.
The former contributed a distinct
and subtle characterization, while
the hitter's comedy came through
excellent handling of comic lines.
James Brougliton displayed ability
for high comedy.
Marion Jones' burlesque of the
heroine was a delightful piece of
comedy, heightened by excellent use
of gesture. Myna Hughes and James
Benet (in two roles each) were ex
ceptionally clever.
The dramatic burden of the opus
was carried by Bob Churchill in an
admirable manner, while Dick Daw
son showed a fine sense of comedy.
Carter Meyer, Bill Drew, Will Wil
liams, and the entire cast made
definite contributions to the eve
ning's festivity, as did James San
doe's offstage noises.
