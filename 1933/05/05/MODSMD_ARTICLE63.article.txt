# Paly To Vote On Sewage
## Present System Is Menace, Declares Engineer 
### 
The Palo Alto electorate will go ,
to the polls Tuesday to vote on a j
proposed $90,000 bond issue to rem- I
edy the sewage disposal system of >
the Palo Alto, Mayfield, and Stan
ford districts, recently condemned
by the state board of health.
The sewage disposal system now
in use has been characterized by i
C. G. Gillespie, chief of the bureau
of sanitary engineering at Sacra
mento as "a menace to adjacent
dairies and waters much used for |
recreation."
Stanford officials have agreed to
pay their share of the maintenance
and bond retirement charges if
the proposed issue is adopted. Un
der present conditions the Stan- |
ford charges run approximately i
one-third of the total cost of the (
sewage system maintenance.
The Palo Alto Chamber of Com
merce issued a statement yesterday
urging the adoption of the bond is
sue, pointing out the local taxpayers
will benefit financially by such a
move.
It is estimated that at Jeast $30,000
will be available in use for employ
ment of local labor. It was pointed
out that creation of work by in
stallation of the new system will
cut down unemployment relief ex
penses considerably.
The project will call for the con
struction of a disposal system
whereby partially treated wasie will
be dumped seven hundred feet off
shore in the San Francisco bay.
