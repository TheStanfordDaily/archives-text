## 
### 
Government versus private cnter
j prise, with the added complications
. I of technical and scientific strides in
1 the modern medical science field,
â–  were the high points of Dr. Ray Ly
i man Wilbur's talk at a banquet of
'j Pi Sigma Alpha, national political
I j science honorary society, last night
j in the Union.
Dr. Wilbur based his remarks on
j the report worked out by him in
| co-operation with a committee of
! about fifty members representing all
j fields of medicine. The development
iof medicine from the "horse-and
j buggy stage" to the present-day
! complicated system of hospitals, X
. j rays, highly trained nurses, hydro
therapeutics, and other expensive
. j accessories has put a financial strain
; on patient, physician, and taxpayer
. that is difficult, to meet. An indirect
; hospital insurance is one means of
! solving the difficulty, says Dr. Wil
. ' bur.
Dr. Wilbur closed his talk by an
swering various questions in line
j with the general topic, explaining
' ' that the solution of the problem lay
i ! with the physicians themselves since
! government control would mean
; abandonment of the important, per
. I sonal physician-patient relationship.
