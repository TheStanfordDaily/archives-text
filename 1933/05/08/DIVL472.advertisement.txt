Harry D. Wat ts, V. P. of James
Stewart &i Co., Inc., builders of
famous buildings throughout the
world, says: "World progress de- j
pends upon engineering. No won
der eager college men look toward
this profession. But to succeed
you must have a technical back
ground, ability to take the
knocks, and alertness to take \
advantage of the breaks."
"ABILITY' to take the knocks." Anc:
yet brains count .above all
That's why in engineering, as in col l l
lege, a pipe is the favorite smoke. A
pipeful of good old Edgeworth Smok
ing Tobacco clears the brain for those
intensive problems that confront th<
engineer . . . or the college man.
Of course most college men know j
Edgeworth.* They like its distinctive 1
flavor that comes only from this blend i
r>f fine old burleys. Perhaps you'd like j
:o try before you buy. Then just writi j
to Larus 6c Bro. Co., 105 S. 226. St., I
Richmond, Va., and you'll get a fret'
-.ample packet of Edgeworth.
