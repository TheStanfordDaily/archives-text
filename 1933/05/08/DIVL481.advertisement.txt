Is the present salary scale for teachers ade
quate? Can it be reduced? How much? What
shall be the basis for reduction?
These are the questions which Dr. Eells
sets out to answer through a definite, factual
study of communities in various parts of the
United States. It is the first detailed investiga
tion of the cost of living for teachers to be
published.
The volume is also the first of the SCHOOL
ECONOMY SERIES, edited by Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur, to appear.
