## DOCTOR BERTHA TELLS REASONS FOR POPULARITY Girls Bring Little Troubles To Her First; Explodes On Gym Piano TEATIME IS BUSIEST Interview Climaxed When Girl Goes Limp 
### 
Interviewed last night, Dr. Bertha
Dyment, recently voted the most
popular officer of Stanford Univer
sity, stated that she was "just too
thrilled for words."
But she wasn't. When questioned,
Doctor Bertha replied glibly, stating,
among other things, the secrets of
her overwhelming popularity among
"her girls.'' "Oh, yes," she cooed,
"they are my girls. 1 know that Dean
Mary claims them, but. she doesn't
know them the way I do."
"I enjoy my work here at Stan
ford so much," she continued, "and
everybody is so kind and helpful. In
particular I appreciate the splendid
support of the student journalists."
And Doc Bertha beamed at a stoop
shouldered reporter, who leered
back at her from behind a boiler
maker.
"And I'm learning so much here
011 the Farm, myself," she twit
tered. "Why almost every day I
learn something about medicine
that I never dreamt of before. The
girls always come to me first with
their little troubles, poor dears, and
they never go down to I'aly to see
another doctor until they've given
ine a chance.
"(Jo To Hell"
"I know that there have been some
remarks passed about the amount of
money spent in furnishing the of
fices in the Women's Gym," said Dr.
Dyment. "But let me assure you that
not one cent is ever spent which is
not spent for the welfare of the girls.
The office is furnished lavishly in
order that they may be comfortable
while waiting to see me. They often
have to wait, you know, while I am
having my afternoon tea.
"How about that matter of renting
the piano to the Relief Fund dance?"
someone asked.
"Oh, go to hell!" snapped the
medic, her good humor vanishing.
Facts of —I'll—Life
"Do you ever teach the girls about
—uh—life?"
"Why yes, once a year," she re
sponded patiently. "Once each year
I explain the uh—facts of—uh—
life to the Stanford women. You see,
the Stanford women are more or
less "
She was interrupted by a stifled
cry. The air was rather tepid in the
room, and one of the Stanford wo
men present at the interview had
chosen that particular moment to
faint. Dr. Dyment, in her very effi
cient manner, took charge immedi
ately.
"Now ujst stand back every
body," she ordered, "and don't get
excited. Will somebody please tele
phone for a doctor?'
