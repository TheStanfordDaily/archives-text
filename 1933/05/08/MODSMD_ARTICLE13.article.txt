"With the backing of our ail-
American student body president, I
expect to get the unanimous back
ing of the campus and win in a
walk," said William Cuthbert Sim, i
Sacramento Junior College transfer
and fraternity brother of Pres. Bill
Corbus, when interviewed about the j
coming campus elections at a local
grog joint late last night.
"I know this comes as a distinct |
surprise to my many friends," Sim
gurgled between burps, "but I am
certain that if we put our soldiers to
the sweel, that everything's gonna
be awl right, ol' boy, ol' boy, Ol . . ."
and he passed away.
Bill, w4io has been on the campus
but two and one-half quarters (or •
five-eighths) has stacked up a hotsy
totsy-vodeo reputation as an athlete,
which is a big essential, it seems, in
the acquisition, of a student body 1
presidency.
He has played football in a big
way, and has also been an old :
roughie in rugby.
His cute blond locks and under
slung jaw have given the girls a big i
quiver when he struts down the ,
row with chest expanded and garters :

Being a football player, he carries !
his old toughie habits into the Phi 1
