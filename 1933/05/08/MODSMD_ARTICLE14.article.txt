## 
### 
With the idea of officialy turning
the library into a hothouse for the
cultivation of pansies, Nathan Van
Patten, director of the libe, yester
day disclosed his plan lo keep the
recently-tuned radiators under full
steam pressure for the rest of the
spring quarter with the prospect of
nursing the many budding pansies
of the library into blooming flowers
for the summer months.
Van Patten's decision came after
complaints had been made to the
effect that the temperature in the
libe had been only 90 degrees. The
director decided that for the wel
fare of the budding growths the
temperature should be raised 10
degrees for the rest of the quarter.

the entire length of its body, and
vice versa.
