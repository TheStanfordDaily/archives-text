## 
### 
Stanford's future h;is been settled
over a pot of pink tea.
In an informal, yet confidential
confab late last night in the cactus
gardens, Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur
and Almon E. Roth .sal sipping the
Oriental beverage.
"The winds of freedom are blow
ing," Dr. Wilbur told Roth.
Roth rose slowly. "Perhaps you
mean 'Die Luft der Freiheit Weht.'"
Acquired Renown
"Stanford has acquired a nation
wide renown as a progressive in
stitution free from Iho shackles of
Puritanism and hide-bound conven
tion," said Dr. Wilbur. "It is our
duty to preserve the tradition of
freedom which has marked our de
velopment."
As the informal discussion contin
ued, Roth brought up the matter of
serving 3.2 sarsaparilla in the Un
ion Cellar. "The students are clam
oring 'Sarsaparillas in the Cellar.'
I presume that it will be in line
with the University's policy to ac
cede to the demand," he said.
"I might mention that we'll make
a nickel a bottle on the stuff," con
tinued Roth.
To this Dr. Wilbur countered:

I "Modern educational institutions run
on their reputations, not money.
Splash even one tea.spoonful of sar
: saparilla on that reputation, and
what do you have?"
"A teaspoonful less sarsaparilla,"
bandied Roth.
Willi the sarsaparilla problem
neatly disposed of, the pair discussed
the matter of lockouts.
"A Stanford woman is entirely
capable of managing her own life,"
offered Roth.
"Liberality is the keynote of prog
ress," replied Wilbur.
"Shall we allow Stanford women
to stay out until 10:45 on Tuesday
nights? There is a definite desire
for the change."
"Certainly," Says Wiliiur
"Certainly," said Dr. Wilbur. "By
all means. Providing they have a
B {- average, are over the age of 35,
and have their parents' consent. Of
course, the escort would have to be
approved by the Administration."
Dr. Wilbur at this point unwit
tingly picked up Roth's cup of pink
tea.
"Them's my sediments, Doc," Roth
sharply reminded the Great Lib
eral.
