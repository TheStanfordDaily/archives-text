"Lawyer John" ilunckc will run for president!
This rumor, which has loomed large 011 the political horizon for some
time, was confirmed last night by the popular "Happy Warrior" himself at
his shanty across San Francisquito creek. "Sure, I'll run," drawled "Lour
John" with a Hash of his famous smile as he cased his six feel and some
odd inches into a broken-down wicker chair and propped his conspicuous
dogs on a door sill. John Huneke, the people's choice, has said the word,
and the news spread like wildfire. One Stanford woman telephoned an
other, and she another, and then all three went to hed, giggling. From
away up at the foot of Frenchman's Hill came a loud and prolonged cheer,
the famous Cardinal l>askctl>all cheer, said to have originated in the
Bronx, New York.
God-Knows-What
The Huneke camp in the meadow across San Francisquito creek,
which will serve, through necessity, as the candidate's campaign headquar
ters, was the scene of feverish activity. Besides the Daily's representative

S and the candidate, there were four
I men in that historic gathering: Abo
MellinkofT, local news columnist and
perpetual agitator for God-knows
what; Howard Moore, constant eom-
panion of Huneke, but better known
as the man who hasn't picked a win
ning horse in seven years on the
| Farm; Ron Kennedy, Toyon presi
dent and wire-puller, who has s .r
more money than any execute
since 1929; and Gene Mires, intra
mural sports mogul and one of the
El Toro promoters. They were all
j there! All the Huneke voters in ono
j room!
Tlie candidate and his friends
j were all sitting around wishing for
a glass of beer. The walls of the
room were literally covered with
pictures—pictures of Huneke as a
baby, as a boy, as a youth, as an
j undergraduate, as a law student, as
a member of a male quartet, as the;
i president of that powerful order, the
I Stanford Glee Club.
"What platform do you intend to
| run on?" ventured the press.
Wit
"Platform?" Long John looked
up from the photograph album he
was admiring. "Why I don't need
a platform. Just give me the track
at Angell Field," he replied, with
a (lash of the quick wit for which
he is famous.
"Well, what do you intend to do
if elected?" The press schnozzie,
thoroughly beaten, stuck out again.
"Just run things as they should
be run," Huneke proclaimed "The
Stanford kids need an older head at
their helm, that of a law student.
Take mine, for example."
Hut nobody did, unfortunately.
Instead MellinkofT, Moore, Ken
nedy, and Mires set up a cheer, in
which the candidate deferentially
joined.
If elected, "Honest John" will b«j
the first native of the wilds across
San Francisquito creek to hold the
presidency of the A.S.S.U. He is
the first trans-San Francisquito can
didate sihee he himself attempted to
run a year ago. On that occasion
,he tossed his hat rather bashfully
into the political ring only to have
some of the Hall big-shots promptly
sit on it.

EL TORO PLEDGE
El Toro announces tho pledging of
"Salesman Sam" Huneke, '31.
BUY MENLO!
To many divorced men, say re
ports, alimony is a matter of wife
and debt.
