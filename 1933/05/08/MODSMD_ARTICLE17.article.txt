# Yenui Medudi, Boy Proditchy, Scratches – – – –

"Eight ball in the corner pocket."
carolled young Yenuhi Medudi, boy
prodigy of the cue and green table,
last night in his exhibition perform
ance up to the Manila Pool Parlor
in Redwood City.
He poised his cue, squinted one
eye, and—scratched. The match was
over. Medudiy had sprained the little
finger of his off-hand.
Hospitalization and other drastic
measures failed to help the injury
along. Naturally, young Medudiy or
some such name will be unable to
appear for his charity performance
in the Stanford Pool and Pasketball
Pavilion pretty soon.
Members of the Concert Series,
who are to blame for hatching the
idea of bringing the miniature vio
linist to the Farm in the first place,
are pretty sore about it. The rest of
the campus just doesn't give a damn.
BUY MENLO!
