## 
### 
The Daily wishes to join the rest of the campus in con
gratulating those lucky people who were elected to mem
bership in Unit august Stanford society, Phi Phi. An honor
society in Hie true sense of the word, this organization
numbers among ils members real all-around men.
Look over the list. There is certainly no one in the
university who is more all-around than Hill Sim. Not only
does he plav good football in the local stadium but he plays
good football in Berkeley, Los Angeles, or any other place
you could care to name. If you do care, name one.
(ilance down the list. There's Hill Millerâ€”another all
around man. He clears over II feet all around the land.
These are only two of the many named.
Take the list as a whole. Yes, take it, God knows we
don'l want it. A more outstanding all-around group of
men it would he hard to lind. In fact it is doubtful if there
is one field of sport which is not covered.
(Congratulations again, representative Stanford men,
and congratulations, Phi Phi.
