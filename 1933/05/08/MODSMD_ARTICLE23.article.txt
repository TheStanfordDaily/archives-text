The Editor, Sir:
Having plenty of money thai I
don't know what to do with, I have
been a regular patron of the Cellar,
where 1 cat morning, noon and
night.
But I am not satisfied with the
lack of variety on the menus. I wish
that Mr. Carver and his subordinates
would stuff a lew tomatoes. This is 1
a favorite fruit, to a fruit, lover, and
would be a treat, to .say the least.
Hoping you are the same, I remain
Yours truly

The Editor, Sir or Madame:
Me being a "J.C." transfer that
just got here at the "Farm" now, I
figure maybe I can give some of you
"campus" big shots a few "point
ers" on what T seen wrong about
"Stanford." Now for example take I

I "beer"—there's hardly any 'frater- ;
nity" house but what wouldn't like ;
to have a few "bottles" now and
then. How's for letting down on the
restrictions and letting the "boys"
have a little "drink" now and then,
anyway. And another thing, it seems
to me as how all these "women's"
things like "A.W.S." and "Pan-Hell" i
don't got enough rulings and regu- '
lations. Why don't they get stricter j
and have more laws about every- I
thing. And the "Dean" of Women :
might use her authority more, just |
like all the rest of the "administra- I
tion." Don't you agree with me, I
"pal"?
