### ABE MELTITOFF 
Consider, if you please, without
abnormally erudite ostentatiousness
arid summately disregarding jocose
belligerosities anent it, that new
fangled fad of drinking beer on bi
cycles.
In my naive fecundities, it has
ever seemed lo me, to paraphrase
an allocation of Ihe ultimate meta
thesis, that beer has its place or
places and the bicycle similar-wise,
that is, in a manner of speaking, as
it were, or may have been, no doubt.
What has the Ex Comittee been
doing about it? Has there been de
cisive action? No, a thousand times
no. While Beer and the Bicycle go
galumphing down the Row toward
Encina and the Hoover home, the
Honor Code slill occupies the
thoughts of 168 Roble maidens
(roughly speaking).
Here is where the long arm of
the newly created Federal Trade
Commission comes in. Millions of
pretzels, a million a day. Wisely has
Roosevelt chosen his time.
And who shall cry "Halt" as Japa
nese machine-guns chatter along
the Great Wall this morning? Is
there a Great Wall around San
Simeon Ranch? Uncle Sam needs
more airplanes. Where, in these bar
ren years, is the romance of jour
nalism?
College life, with its campi, its
stadia, its Bookstori, goes on from
left to right as it always has. This is
as it should be. But where do the
Publications get oil, what is their
role in the great poker game that
men call life and vice versa. The
Daily drivels limply, Chappie snivels

■ whimsically, the Quad bclches softly.
' You can be had, dark and handsome.
Words, words, are cheap. Have
they settled the beer-on-bicycles
problem? It seems a twisted bit of
pathos to recall here how in far
away Pago-Pago & Pago the sun
shines through the palm-fronds in
a golden haze and the maidens walk
lissomely with swaying hips.
Yet who ever thinks of Pop War
ner now or Hoover? Gone are the
i times when no two names were
greater in the twin fields of fish-
I lore and Japanese prints.
But why multiply examples. I can
think of other things to multiply;
j so can you, my friends. Topics of
importance come and great men
who t;,lk about them go. It is fate—
a 13 to 5 bet in the eighth race.
J Materialism? Who shall say ma
terialism when the mighty pano
rama of America's national exist
ence is shaping behind the gauzy
veils of Euphronia. Muse of bridge
whist, frozen dainties, and Harpo
Marx. Materialism, Idealism, Ro
manticism, Cynicism—faugh. Love—
five.
It has been hard to settle all the
great problems of the world in these
GOO words. Maybe tomorrow I'd bet
ter go over some of them again. But
then ambition heeds no bounds—in
telligence alone can guard the little
ones at home the bugles of the
Foreign Legion are calling, calling,
i calling.
| The world has need of us, we
must away, WE MUST AWAY.
I GOT A MATCH?

whist, frozen dainties, and Harpo
Marx. Materialism, Idealism, Ro
manticism, Cynicism—faugh. Love—

It has been hard to settle all the
great problems of the world in these
GOO words. Maybe tomorrow I'd bet
ter go over some of them again. But

I GOT A MATCH?
—Abe Meltitoff
Consider, if you please, without
abnormally erudite ostentatiousness
arid summately disregarding jocose
belligerosities anent it, that new
fangled fad of drinking beer on bi
cycles.
In my naive fecundities, it has
ever seemed lo me, to paraphrase
an allocation of Ihe ultimate meta
thesis, that beer has its place or
places and the bicycle similar-wise,
that is, in a manner of speaking, as
it were, or may have been, no doubt.
What has the Ex Comittee been
doing about it? Has there been de
cisive action? No, a thousand times
no. While Beer and the Bicycle go
galumphing down the Row toward
Encina and the Hoover home, the
Honor Code slill occupies the
thoughts of 168 Roble maidens
(roughly speaking).
Here is where the long arm of
the newly created Federal Trade
Commission comes in. Millions of
pretzels, a million a day. Wisely has
Roosevelt chosen his time.
And who shall cry "Halt" as Japa
nese machine-guns chatter along
the Great Wall this morning? Is
there a Great Wall around San
Simeon Ranch? Uncle Sam needs
more airplanes. Where, in these bar
ren years, is the romance of jour
nalism?
College life, with its campi, its
stadia, its Bookstori, goes on from
left to right as it always has. This is
as it should be. But where do the
Publications get oil, what is their
role in the great poker game that
men call life and vice versa. The
Daily drivels limply, Chappie snivels

■ whimsically, the Quad bclches softly.
' You can be had, dark and handsome.
Words, words, are cheap. Have
they settled the beer-on-bicycles
problem? It seems a twisted bit of
pathos to recall here how in far
away Pago-Pago & Pago the sun
shines through the palm-fronds in
a golden haze and the maidens walk
lissomely with swaying hips.
Yet who ever thinks of Pop War
ner now or Hoover? Gone are the
i times when no two names were
greater in the twin fields of fish-
I lore and Japanese prints.
But why multiply examples. I can
think of other things to multiply;
j so can you, my friends. Topics of
importance come and great men
who t;,lk about them go. It is fate—
a 13 to 5 bet in the eighth race.
J Materialism? Who shall say ma
terialism when the mighty pano
rama of America's national exist
ence is shaping behind the gauzy
veils of Euphronia. Muse of bridge
whist, frozen dainties, and Harpo
Marx. Materialism, Idealism, Ro
manticism, Cynicism—faugh. Love—
