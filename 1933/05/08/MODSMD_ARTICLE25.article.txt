BEYOND DESIRE — Bv Sherwood ]
Anderson.
Anderson used to make pretty
I good reading on rainy nights, back
! in the days when he concerned hini
' self with "Dark Laughter." His
! "Beyond Desire," however, falls
{ short, which, in the Anderson style,
! necessarily results in the publishing
! of an abortive attempt at a novel.
The chief trouble is that Ander
i son tries to cover far too much ter
-1 ritory within the boards of a single
volume. The author deals with the
Old South, the New South, the race
question, the capital and labor di
vergence, socialism, communism,
| and love on a public library table.
' Needless to aver, the love on a table
sequence is by far the most en
i grossing of all the various scenes in
I Anderson's kaleidoscopic hodge
i podge.
Anderson's style is unique, one
| might even say screwy. The reader
' is never quite certain whether the
j hero, named Red, is being hidden
in a hayloft by a girl who thinks
he is a fugitive communist, or
whether some other guy who thinks
he is a communist is dreaming that
he is Red and being hidden in a
hayloft by a girl who knew better
all along.
Somebody in need of a job ought
I to undertake an indexing of foot
i noting of this Anderson novel. It
I would be a service to a reading pub
| lie several decades behind the au
thor's time. But the annotator wj!l
| have to solve the question of what
, lies beyond desire, since none of
; Anderson's characters succeed in
escaping the pangs of purely physi
i cal yearning. There is a possibility
that Anderson ignores the sex factor
j in his idea of what lies beyond de
sire, but any fool knows better than
that. —J.H.C.
TODAY WE LIVE (Come and gone).
Of all the grut shows .... There
, is no stopping this Crawford woman.
1 In every release somebody's Joan
' (she s not our Joan any more) looks
t more and more like a Vanity Fair
| caricature and acts more and more
! like that flank cut of hog known
i as ham. In "Today We Live" the
hair is a little stragglier, the eye

sockets a little deeper, *he mouth a
little more droopish with sorrow,
than they were in the last Joan
Crawford vehicle we didn't go to see.
Gary Cooper is in it, with his
time-worn attitude of stoicism, an
attitude which he evidently believes
to portray a strong man holding the
whip over a strong emotion, but
which in reality resembles a simple
ton trying to yawn with his mouth
closed while a rough surgeon is
lancing a boil on the back of his
neck.
Robert Armstrong and this new
guy Franchot Tone steal the picture.
That is, they aren't quite so offensive
