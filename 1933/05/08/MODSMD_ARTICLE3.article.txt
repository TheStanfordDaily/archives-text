# "Were We Elected?" Shrill Corbus, Karl As Queens Snicker
## Frustrated A.S.S.U. Heads Moan As Secretaries Do All Work 
### 
Declaring that "We were elected,
weren't we?" Charles Karl and Wil
liam Corbus yesterday took the first
steps in a battle lor their rights as
officeholders. They were laying plans
to present to Dr. Wilbur a petition
that has been signed by Al Masters
and thirty-two members of Phi
Delta Theta. Karl is laughingly re
ferred to us the "Student Manager."
'Corbus bears the satirical title of
"President" of A.S.S.U.
Meanwhile Miss Stevens and
IVliss Aten, operating under the
guise of "secretaries" lo the presi
dent and manager, continued to
control Stanford student govern
ment with as much efficiency as
tin' quibbling of the two office
holding students would permit.
Miss Aten, interviewed late last
night, would say little for publica
tion. In speaking of her "bosses,"
(the two students), she muttered
something about "cluttering up the
office." It is said that she is shield-
I in;; the office-holders, principally
i because she is a friend of an aunt
of Karl on his mother's side.
Miss Stevens, on the other hand,
showed no such reticence. With voice
lowered to a whisper, she breathed
| the horrible truth.
"Corbus is an athlete, and Karl
is is a.. . ." she faltered,
made the supreme effort within
herself, and blurted, "a business
student." Her tone held a quality
ol finality, as though there was
nothing more to be said. There
i wasn't.
i Armed with this invulnerable
I logic, suspecting that the cause of
the students was hopeless, your re
i porter nevertheless gave ear to the
claims of the office-holders.
"We have been in these positions
i for almost a school year, now," Karl
began, "and we think it's about time
we had something to say about stu
j dent government."
"Those meddlesome secretaries
I seem to think us incapable," Corbus
added. "Why, if we were given our
heads ....
"What heads?" your reporter
shot at him. Ignoring this, he con
. tinned:
"We would pay the athletes . .
"And move the business office
of the Quad over to Frenchman's
i Ilill," Karl interrupted.
"And make the Dramatic Council
produce 'The Volga Boatman' as a
spring musical show . . . ."
"And make Stanford safe for ath
letes"
"And business school students . . ."
His suspicious confirmed, your
reporter walked calmly out of the
A.S.S.U. executive sanctum, tore
gold-embossed signs of "President"
and "Student Manager" off the
door, and offered them, together
with his sympathy, to the secre
taries in the outer office.

Miss Aten, interviewed late last
night, would say little for publica
tion. In speaking of her "bosses,"
(the two students), she muttered
something about "cluttering up the
office." It is said that she is shield-
I in;; the office-holders, principally
i because she is a friend of an aunt
of Karl on his mother's side.
Miss Stevens, on the other hand,
showed no such reticence. With voice
lowered to a whisper, she breathed
| the horrible truth.
"Corbus is an athlete, and Karl
is is a.. . ." she faltered,
made the supreme effort within
herself, and blurted, "a business
student." Her tone held a quality
ol finality, as though there was
nothing more to be said. There
i wasn't.
i Armed with this invulnerable
I logic, suspecting that the cause of
the students was hopeless, your re
i porter nevertheless gave ear to the
claims of the office-holders.
"We have been in these positions
i for almost a school year, now," Karl
began, "and we think it's about time
we had something to say about stu
j dent government."
"Those meddlesome secretaries
I seem to think us incapable," Corbus
added. "Why, if we were given our
heads ....
"What heads?" your reporter
shot at him. Ignoring this, he con
. tinned:
"We would pay the athletes . .
"And move the business office
of the Quad over to Frenchman's
i Ilill," Karl interrupted.
"And make the Dramatic Council
produce 'The Volga Boatman' as a
spring musical show . . . ."
"And make Stanford safe for ath
letes"
"And business school students . . ."
His suspicious confirmed, your
reporter walked calmly out of the
A.S.S.U. executive sanctum, tore
gold-embossed signs of "President"
and "Student Manager" off the
door, and offered them, together
with his sympathy, to the secre
taries in the outer office.

Declaring that "We were elected,

liam Corbus yesterday took the first
steps in a battle lor their rights as
officeholders. They were laying plans
