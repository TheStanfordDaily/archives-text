The budding experimental psy

thi.s morning from staggering blows
it received yesterday with the news
thai, in the department's attempt to
elevate the name of the university

greatest exponent of rat maze learn
ing, Oscar, pet rat of the department,
starved to death yesterday morning
before it could complete the T

Considered the most intelligent rat
with which the psychologists have
