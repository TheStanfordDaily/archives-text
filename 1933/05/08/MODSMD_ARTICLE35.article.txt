The radio broadcast (by Garry
Breckner) of Saturday's track meet
with U.S.C. included several com
ments by Coach Drink Templeton
which certainly were the best we
have heard.
When results of the javelin were
announced, and McKenzie of Troy
defeated Mottram of Stanford by
three-quarters of an inch, Dink
grumbled, "So they finally outmeas
ured us, huh?"
Later, when they were arguing
over the spiking points in (he two
mile canter, Drink asked Ab > Hables
why ho wasn't down in the argu
ment. Hables modestly refused, but
we surely like that fighting spirit,
Dink. That's what gets 'em.
