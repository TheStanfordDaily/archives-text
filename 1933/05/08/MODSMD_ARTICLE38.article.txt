{track meet.
What a meet! What a spectacle!
Brcckner's flashy description, par
ticularly of the 100-yard dash,
proved an innovation in sportcast
ing. Ho started oft' with Ball three
yards ahead of the field, only
Hables was leading, he said. £Jow
evc-r, he couldn't make up his mind
which one crossed the line first, and
j finally gave the "unofficial" returns
: with Lombardi the victor.
Geez, it was swell.
| Brecker scintillated again but a
j few moments later. He was the star.
; He should be with Kolb and Dill.
I wish he were.
His next big break into a rash
came with the announcement that
, Johnny Lyman had "tossed the shot
I 52 feet (j inches—Ooop. there goes
j a swell javelin throw—which breaks
| the Stanford record." Lyman did
! 52 feet, 1-2 inch.
Letters began pouring into the
1 Columbia Wx'ongcasting Studios im
i mediately after the meet. All were
of the highest raise.
