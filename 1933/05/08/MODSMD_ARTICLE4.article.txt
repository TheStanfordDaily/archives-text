# Dunn Grunts, B.A.C. Hunts New Pants For The Runt
## 
### 
The need for a new pair of track
pants to replace the ones that Gor
don Dunn busted out when he ate
three extra plank stakes one evening
will be explained before the next I
meeting of the Board of Athletic >
Control, it was announced yesterday j
by Alfred R. Plasters.
Plasters said, "When Dunn grunts,
he grunts, and that old discus or
shot just goes skittering through the
air. We gotta give him room to |
expand."
It is understood that Omar the
Tentmaker will be on the campus
next week, should the B.A.C. come !
to the fore.
