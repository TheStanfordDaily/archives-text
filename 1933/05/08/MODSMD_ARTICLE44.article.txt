# BROADBOTTOM HAS BIG DAY AS PILLS HANDBALLERSLOSE
## 
### Barbara Zitch 
My, but we had the best time yes
terday! Our girls played the girls
j from Pills College in the annual
handballs tournament for this
month, and did we throw handballs
at them! The final score was zero
to zero, but that wasn't the half of it.
Millicent Broadbottom, who ca
vorted from precipice to precipice
j and back again in a recent moun
tain-climbing tournament, was the
' whole show. Millie simply had us
all a-fritter with her spectacular
scoop plays, one of which came near
to causing a casualty when Millie
slipped in a puddle of burp and
damn near went through the floor.
Millie wasn't badly hurt, however.
shc just broke her contract and
severed her relations and bounced
/ on he rear a little.
; i Fannie Brown, who played left—
s center-forward-right-guard, was the
best the Pills girls had to offer. Her
sylph-like form flitted around the
floor likp a seagull, and was just
heavenly to watch.
. i The lineups:
Pills College—Myrtle Handspring,
right inside; Becky Flishkin, two
doors to the left; Vivian Smutch, i
substitute; Agnes Drool, substitute.
Stanford—Jennie Whistledrawers,
j just outside; Mabel Sidewinder, right j
here; Gloria Gulch, substitute; M. A.
Loos, what a substitute!
