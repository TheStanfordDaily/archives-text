# "Bratchberry" Masque Queen Hoax Revealed
## How And Why Was King Sober? Facts Told 
### 
I Pi Beta Phi laced a most colossal
task on the eve of the recent Masque
Ball, according to rumors which
reached this office yesterday. The
problem faced by the sisters was to
find somebody to run for Queen. But
they had a hell of a time, and finally
| when they picked on Rose "Body"
. Cubbison, they were faced with the
; new job of concealing their choice
J if they ever expected to win the
election.
So this "Bratchberry" gag was
thought up, and it worked for a
wonder, besides giving a few inches
j to the Call-Bulletin correspondent,
i The reports continued to say that the
Dekes almost got hooked in on the
original plan, but when Philipe de
P. de C. de Gamier chicken out on
the second day, the Pi Phi's were left
gripping the gunny.
The liquor bill was 12 fish (some
say 20) and when Axe Nyeland, the
D.U. Pride and Joy, was susceptible
to argument, he became Mr. Bratch
berry then and there, so help him.
And with Hewlett's dough.
What the campus wondered about
was how the King happened to be
i in such good condition.
i "Ilell," says Nyeland to Eph
I Engleman (the report continues)
in front of the microphone. "Hell,
j we could have been plenty swack
| ed and gotten away with it."
But the exciting truth leaked out
last night. Stanley "Rosy-lips" Beau
j baire was the real Queen. Beaubaire
confessed to a Daily man who
j sneaked up to his room in spite of
; the rules against men in the hall.
! Few persons realized when they saw
â€¢ the beautifully formed body and
wavy blonde hair of the Ball Queen
I that it was all a magnificent hoax.
"And to think that we did it all
with a couple of handkerchiefs and
a wig! Just one of those triumphs
of modern science."
The reporter's dry remark that it
I was too bad that modern surgery
I couldn't do things in other fields
went entirely unappreciated by the
j ex-queen, who dismissed the news
monger with the remark that he had
to undress and get ready for bed.
