Miss Doyle smiled at the enthusi

"Is it true, Miss Doyle," one of the
reporters asked, "that women are
compelled to wear shoes at fire drill
instead of bedroom slippers?"
"Slippers are unbecoming a Stan

out of her drawing room.
"I'm very sorry to have to bid
you goodnight, gentlemen," said
Anastasia. "bfit it's nearly 10:2!),
you know."
