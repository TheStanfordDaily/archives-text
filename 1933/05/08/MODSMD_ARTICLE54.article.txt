# Squads East! It Is War! R.O.T.C. In Fighting Trim

"We are pacifists."
Called to answer stinging charges
of the campus War against War
against War against War League
which held that the Stanford
R.O.T.C. was fomenting an alarm
ing war spirit among the students,
Lieut.-Col. D. C. Cubbison today
not only denied the charges but
offered a complete rebuttal.
"Ilell," said Cubison, or words
to that effect, "we are pacifists.
Can't jijwu see—you must see—that
the training we are giving the
men is the best possible insurance
against war?
"If all the armies in the world
were made up of R.O.T.C.'s there

couldn't be any war. Nobody in
the R.O.T.C. knows enough to
fight a war, let alone start one."
Cubbison said that after four years
of training under the special guid
ance of the officers of the staff, the
average student is definitely un
equipped to tell the difference be
tween "squads east" and "scrum."
These are two totally unrelated
terms, he explained.
"How could such a man fight a
war?" asked the Colonel.
Already the freshman students
are quite unable to even answer
roll call, or get their shoes on the
right feet.
"War is hell," concluded Cub
bison.
