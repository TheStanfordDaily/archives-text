# Campus Men Commence Ruining Encina Lobby
## 
### 
Campus men, cognizant of Encina
Hall's newly refinished lobby, have
been flocking to the male Bastille
during the week-end to rest their
feet on the backs of the overstuffed
furniture in order that it might be
come shabby as soon as possible.
Student Manager Charlie Karl
could hardly restrain himself when
he first discovered how well the idea
had taken.
