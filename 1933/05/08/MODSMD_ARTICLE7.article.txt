# "Great Idea," Says Corbus To New Proposals
## Favors Replacing Stadium With Cockroach Track 
### 
"I think it's a fine idea."
With this profound declaration,
Willian Corbus, All-American foot
baller, Student Body President, '33,
tee-totaller, Reason Why Frosh Go
Phi Delt, last night went on record
in favor of tearing down the sta
dium to erect in its place a cock
roach racetrack.
"Yes," Corbus continued, "there is
no question about it. It is a fine idea.
It is a great idea."
Corbus, fondly called by S.F. sports
writers the Baby Faced Assassin,
thinks everything is a fine idea. A
man in New Orleans told Corbus he
thought it would be a good "scheme"
to pay football players. Corbus
agreed. Concerning this proposal he
said, "I think it is a fine idea." '
Bill, essentially a prominent hu
man being, declared late last night
that as far as he knew everything
is going along all right.
EUY MENLO!
