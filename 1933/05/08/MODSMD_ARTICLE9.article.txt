# HEWLETT GOES HOME, PI PHI'S & AKL'S MOURN
## "Who'll Take My Place?" Asks Speedball As Diploma Looms

Loss of Stanford's biggest femi-
I nine asset was the theme of the
Marion Hewlett wake held in the Pi
j Phi house last night, when Queen
I Emeritus Hewlett told the assembled
1 multitude that but forty-two days
remained before her graduation this
spring and so far there was 110 one
to approach her.
"Packard roadsters are at a
premium," continued Hewlett,
"and the future looks bleak for Pi
Phi and Stanford. It is the end of
an era. Beer comes, but Hewlett
goes, and the campus will be a
sadder and quieter place because
of it"
Four years ago Miss Hewlett ar- j
rived on the campus and immediate
ly made a wide place for herself.
Woman of destiny from the first, she
became a bray among subdued whis
pers.
"My last duty to the school is to
find someone to take my place,"
bawled Miss Hewlett. "The gener
ous niche I am leaving will be
hard to fill."
Strong supporter of everything !
Stanford, Miss Hewlett is best re
j membered for her gallant support of ,
her consort, King Prelsnik, the lib
eral monarch of last year's Masque .
Ball. Although the king does not re
member the events of that night,
I IVliss Hewlett's purchases of liniment
the following day are well remem
-1 bcred by Palo Alto merchants.
Members of the Alpha Tau Omega
fraternity when questioned con- [
cerning the departure approved of
the idea when they stated that the ,
. resultant quiet would mean an aver
' age of two more hours of sleep per
night for each brother.
