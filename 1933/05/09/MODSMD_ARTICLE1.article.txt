# 100 YARD DASH VERDICT WILL NOT FACE QUIZ
## Stanford Officials Accept Decision Giving Hables Second Place FINAL SCORE 72 TO 58 Morentin-Foore Two-Mile Race Suggested For Fresno Relays 
### Albert Guerard, Jr 
Stanford will not take any official
action against the decision which
awarded first place in the 100-yard
dash last Saturday to Les Ball of
University of Southern California,
relegating Les Habits to second af
ter most of the crowd had thought
the Indian runner had won the race
by slightly less than one foot.
While photographs of the race
show an apparent edge to the Stan
ford runner, light conditions and
the position of the camera fre
quently make the mechanical eye
of the photograph less accurate
than the human eye of a trained
judge.
Had the decision been awarded to
Hables, the final score would have :
been Stanford 60, U.S.C. 70. The
one-point discrepancy from the us
ual 131 is accounted lor by the fact i
that there was no official third place
in the two-mile run. The runners in i
this event finished in the following i
order: Dave Foore (USC), Phil Mo- j
rentin (S) running with one shoe for '
five laps, Everett Winn (USC), Ollie .
Amdahl (Stanford). Art Azevedo i
did not finish the race because of ;
stomach cramps. Thus Winn was i
the official winner and Amdahl the j
official second place man.
Malcolm McNaughton was deli- I
nicely proved eligible on Thurs- j
day, thus quashing all rumors that !
Troy used a man on Saturday '
who should not have competed.
Kenneth McKenzie's less-than-j
one-inch victory in the javelin for
the second consecutive year cannot I
be questioned. The U.S.C. spear- |
tosser's pair of wins must go down j
in history as a colossal coincidence !
â€”no more.
The announcement of the javelin I
throw was disheartening, but the j
infinitesimal margin which Stan- j
ford's Paul Zaches held over Gilbert |
in the broad jump was no doubt j
just as discouraging to Trojan sup
porters.
