# Objective Of Theatre Fund Shows Drop
## Total Amount Sought Is Placed At $1 50,000 
### 
With the present balance of the
Stanford Theatre Fund reaching a
$4300 mark, a 50 per cent reduc
tion in the final sum lias heen an
nounced because of depression
conditions.
The movement for a new theatre
at Stanford was first suggested as
a concrete project by a magazine,
"Concerning Stanford," for Decem
ber 1927. From this as a starting
point progress has been marked,
reaching a peak in the recent action
of the Executive Committee in ap
pointing a Theatre Fund Committee.
Credit for the inception of the
theatre fund itself goes to Ham
mer and Coffin, honorary publish
ing society. Members of this or
ganization in their capacity as
publishers of Chaparral made the
first contribution of $100, sug
gesting an ultimate goal of $.150,-
000, an amount which has now
been reduced to $150,000.
Further suggestion was made that
as soon as the payments on the
Pavilion should be completed, that
the same plan be used for paying
for a theatreâ€”that of taking one
dollar from each student's quarterly
fee. Payments on the Pavilion have
since been completed.
Proceeds from the showing of the
campus-made movie, "The P'ast
Male," amounting to $125, were add
ed to the fund early in 1929. Re
ceipts from the Masque Ball were
also contributed.
The entire March Chaparral was
devoted to the project, the fund at
thai, time totaling $2,4f>9.27.
"The Theatre Fund Follies,' 'a
vaudeville performance in April
1929, boosted the amount by $400.
Members of the present Theatre
Fund Committee are Barbara Col
lins, Mary Anita Loos, Marion
Hewlett, Don Cameron, Joe Wolf,
Fritz Goodwin, Hill Waltman, (iirv
Whitney, and Stan Bcaubairc,
chairman.
