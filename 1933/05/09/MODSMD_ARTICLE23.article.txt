# Campus Leaders Urge Building Of Stanford Theatre
## Faults in Assembly Hall Ruinous to Stanford Dramatics; Whirlpool of "Treacherous Drafts" Annoys Spectators, Claim Play Supporters 
### STAN BEAUBAIRE 
"Stanford needs a new theatre and she needs it now!" With this cry
| ringing over the campus today, pressure from various sources has caused
to be instituted a definite attempt to see that this need is cared for in
the not-too-distant future.
Following recent dramatic controversies over failure of productions to
! show profits during a long period, a series of charges hurled at the innocent
cause of the present chain of circumstances shows why action is necessary
today.
Campus leaders and stars of recent productions hastened to point out
that numerous basic faults in the present Assembly Hall are "ruinous t«»
Stanford dramatics" and branded the building as an "inadequate, barren,
barn-like structure, lacking in facilities for proper production of plays,
and extremely uncomfortable for the audience which is compelled to sit
two hours or more in a of treacherous drafts." Other accusu-

fctions followed, resulting in the prcs
j ent effort of the Theatre Fund Com
j mittee to secure a new theatre for
Stanford.
| Stanford, in the opinion of the
Theatre Fund Committee, is on the
eve of a new era. For better or for
worse, the Old Farm is bound to
come out of the so-called period of
; business depression on a new foot
! "ig.
It is with this thought in mind
that the Theatre Fund Committee
has seen fit to revive this very old
| issue, long a bone of contention on
the campus, and take up for final
action the task of continuing the
aims of the founders of the Univer
sity in expanding toward a Greater
Stanford—with the first step in mind
a new theatre.
The immediate object of this
move is the construction of an at
tractive, comfortable, modern
theatre, worthy of the name of
Stanford, and adequate to the
I needs of today's "theatre-con
scious'' student body.
It is not a drive for money; rather
; it is at first primarily an attempt to
| inform the campus of what has been
done to date on the matter and what.
1 is intended shall be done in the near
! future.
Today, the Illustrated Review,
alumni organ, makes its appear
ance with a "Theatre Issue" and
the Chaparral is following suit on
i Thursday.
Stanford has long realized that the
campus needs that theatre. It is the
' aim of the campus organizations of
' today to see that Stanford gets that
theatre.

a new theatre.
The immediate object of this
move is the construction of an at
tractive, comfortable, modern
theatre, worthy of the name of
Stanford, and adequate to the
I needs of today's "theatre-con
scious'' student body.
It is not a drive for money; rather
; it is at first primarily an attempt to
| inform the campus of what has been
done to date on the matter and what.
1 is intended shall be done in the near
! future.
Today, the Illustrated Review,
alumni organ, makes its appear
ance with a "Theatre Issue" and
the Chaparral is following suit on
i Thursday.
Stanford has long realized that the
campus needs that theatre. It is the
' aim of the campus organizations of
' today to see that Stanford gets that
theatre.
