# A 						Genius Appears Tonight Before an Apathetic Campus
## 
### 
A great musician will appear in (lie Pavilion tonight.
Yehudi Menuhin, 10-year-old violinist, accepted by the
world, as "a Mozart alive, a miracle, a genius," lifts his how
al X:2O in the closing concert of the A.S.S.t'. series.
lie will play to the usual throng of Palo Altoans and
Peninsula residents' and to the usual smattering of Stan
lord students. This is a certainty, unless there is an un
precedented rush on the box oflice tonight. Concert Series
heads estimate that not more than a third of the audience
will be Stanford students, and that thev will contribute not
more than a tilth of the receipts.
Obviously, this is a deplorable situation. Hut what can
be done about it ? The quality of the artists engaged for the
concerts is high fully as good as similar series which seem
to have little trouble keeping out of the red in neighboring
colleges. Lacking voluntary support here, the answer seems
to be subsidizing, if the Concert Series is to continue.
I he I niversily is in no position to do any subsidizing.
And while an extra dollar or so tacked on the 11 I would
lÂ»< quite painless, should it be done?
There isn't a genuine demand for the concerts. It is
too bad that the musical tastes of Stanford men and women
are too much in the raw to appreciate a Menuhin. Hut
there's no sense in using a subsidy to stuff hunks of culture
down unwilling throats.
