# On Mothers and a Tea— With an Inevitable "Thank You"
## 
### 
I ho siime thing mav have boon going on for genera
lions, hul a member of Ihe present "younger generation"
can scarcely believe oilier than that his is the most scorch
ingiy criticized stream of young blood this time-weary
world has over seen. ()n all sides the youth of the "Thirsty
I hirlies hears himself condemned as the most careless,
most irresponsible, mosl immoral, most this-and-that up
siarl over. Many of his maligners believe their words, and
otten the maligned individual is inclined to believe them
100. Hut the youth in question is not left without a spar
l<» cling to. tic still 1 1:i s the one, unfailing friend whom
human nature traditionally provides. 11 is mother still loves
him.
Social evolution, lagging tardily behind industrial and
economic evolution, has seen many watchwords of an old
sate and sound society heaped in discard. "Church, fam
ily, chivalry those are three words, three influences,
which, right or wrong, do not play the important part in
the lives of today's young men and women that they played
in the lives of preceding generations. Only motherhood,
the most time-honored and sacred influence of all, retains
ils full effectiveness in moulding the manners and morals
of modern youth.
I oday s collegians are among the first individuals to
have lived their entire lives under a social order different
than that in which today's parent generation grew to ma
turity. I hat situation is probably as old as life itself. Nev
ertheless, it implies that the mothers of today, while not
always understanding their children, are still running true
to form.
Motherhood and mother-love reap their especial glori
fication Sunday. On that one day each vear the wife and
mother becomes the matriarch of her own little family
kingdom. For one day each year she is made the object of
an affectionate attention, the superior of which she lavishes
upon her loved ones through all tile days of her life.
•lust tomorrow, Stanford's mothers, organized into the
Mothers' Club, the most wholly unselfish little group con
ceivable, is giving its annual benefit tea. They're giving a
lea not for a social fund, not for money to purchase bridge
prizes, but in order thai their sons, or some other mother's
daughters, may receive individual attention at the Host
1 tomes.
I here is little that a child can say to a mother which
docs not begin with "thank you" or end with that homely
expression of appreciation. Stanford's women -students
have the opportunity of thanking the Mothers' Club by
olloring I licit* services at the club's functions. For the men
students, the Daily would like to express a "thank you"
to Stanford's mothers.
The editorial staff will meet today at 1 :I,"> oYloek.
