# BULL SESSION
## A 						RAZZ A DAY KEEPS THINGS MOVING 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
There is nothing like a <jood
scathing Razz Sheet to raise my
temperature, bile, eholer, vials of
v/rath, dudgeon, bitter resentment,
and wrathful indignation in that
order (to quote Roget's International
Thesaurus of English Words and
Phrases) —my dander to be a bit
colloquial—and "is my poor face
red?" as the moderns put it. But
that is all personal. Lifting ourselves
from the pitifully narrow canyon of
personal taste to the broad vista of
world problems in the abstract, our
reaction to the Razz is distinctly
different.
The Razz is very, very funny; that
is its purpose. It is excellent to have
such a thing once a year to give the
"boys" their opportunity. But whj'
not a Razzing Daily "every day in
the year? The Razz gets its very
broad humor by the exaggeration of
the obvious and the manufacture of
the unknown. But being so "broad"
it quickly passes from view and is
lost and gone forever—a momentary
gale of snickers on the heaving sea
of Life.
For example, there is Corbus and
Karl—President and Manager re
spectively—or maybe we should say
l'cspectfully. Anyway, there they
are. Why wait till the end of the
year to write a very funny story?
Everyone sees the joke; laughs heart
ily for a few minutes; and all is

' forgotten. Why not write funny
stories about them every time they
put the foot in or the schnozzle
out? This will happen a goodly
number of times with anyone in an
executive position.
Then it seems that Bill Sim and
John Huneke are planning to run
for A.S.S.U. President. That is a
.splendid motive —no doubt. Why
doesn't the Daily request of them
actual platforms upon which they
plan to ride to victory? Then those
platforms can be discussed gin the
editorial *nd Campus Opinion col
umns. Then people can vote with
some semblance of discrimination.
For too long we have been electing
candidates on their profiles rather
than their platforms.
Of course these candidates can be
"attacked" with gurgles and giggles
—but that won't do anything. The
students laugh; for it's funny. Then
they promptly disassociate the Razz
fables from the Farm facts, and
' vote as they SEE. Why not mak:-
' the students laugh in a way that
will have results at the election
box? Let (hem vote as they think
they THINK.
"Time" magazine is a weekly razz
sheet of the proper caliber. But
I everything can't be settled in one
day. WE MUST AWAY. WF,
i FOUND A MATCH.

actual platforms upon which they
plan to ride to victory? Then those
platforms can be discussed gin the
editorial *nd Campus Opinion col
umns. Then people can vote with
some semblance of discrimination.
For too long we have been electing
candidates on their profiles rather
than their platforms.
Of course these candidates can be
"attacked" with gurgles and giggles
—but that won't do anything. The
students laugh; for it's funny. Then
they promptly disassociate the Razz
fables from the Farm facts, and
' vote as they SEE. Why not mak:-
' the students laugh in a way that
will have results at the election
box? Let (hem vote as they think
they THINK.
"Time" magazine is a weekly razz
sheet of the proper caliber. But
I everything can't be settled in one
day. WE MUST AWAY. WF,
i FOUND A MATCH.
There is nothing like a <jood
scathing Razz Sheet to raise my
temperature, bile, eholer, vials of
v/rath, dudgeon, bitter resentment,
and wrathful indignation in that
order (to quote Roget's International
Thesaurus of English Words and
Phrases) —my dander to be a bit
colloquial—and "is my poor face
red?" as the moderns put it. But
that is all personal. Lifting ourselves
from the pitifully narrow canyon of
personal taste to the broad vista of
world problems in the abstract, our
reaction to the Razz is distinctly
different.
The Razz is very, very funny; that
is its purpose. It is excellent to have
such a thing once a year to give the
"boys" their opportunity. But whj'
not a Razzing Daily "every day in
the year? The Razz gets its very
broad humor by the exaggeration of
the obvious and the manufacture of
the unknown. But being so "broad"
it quickly passes from view and is
lost and gone forever—a momentary
gale of snickers on the heaving sea
of Life.
For example, there is Corbus and
Karl—President and Manager re
spectively—or maybe we should say
l'cspectfully. Anyway, there they
are. Why wait till the end of the
year to write a very funny story?
Everyone sees the joke; laughs heart
ily for a few minutes; and all is

' forgotten. Why not write funny
stories about them every time they
put the foot in or the schnozzle
out? This will happen a goodly
number of times with anyone in an
executive position.
Then it seems that Bill Sim and
John Huneke are planning to run
for A.S.S.U. President. That is a
.splendid motive —no doubt. Why
doesn't the Daily request of them
