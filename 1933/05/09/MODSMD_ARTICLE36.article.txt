"KING KONG" (R.K.0.) — \1 Uu*
Stanford Theatre.
Old King Kong was a merry old
soul, and he unwittingly provides a
very merry evening for whnesses
of his antedeluvian antics on the
silver screen. Unwittingly, one sup
poses, because King Kong was evi
dently intended as straight and
serious entertainment of tho horror
variety. Horror it is, ar.d entertain
ment is certainly is in every sense
of the word, often to the point of
hilarious laughter.
The film narrates the story of n
thrill-seeking movie director who
finds an island "never before visited
by white man," a strangely con
structed bit of landscape divided in
half by a tremendous wall. ~>n on:*
side of this lives a pet apeman
about fifty feet high, named Kong,
to whom the natives (on the ->ther
side of the fence) whimsically sacri
fice a bride on occasion. Oddly
enough, Ihe whites arrive just a f
the time of the "wedding," and,
casting convention to the winds, the
natives decide that white meat
would intrigue Kong and so capture
Ann, the leading (in fact, the only)
woman of the outfit.
The remainder of the film is di
vided between the agonies of Ann,
the pursuits of her friends, led by
her fiance (Bruce Cabot), and the
quaint machinations of Kong.
And there's nothing petty about
this picture; in rapid succession you
may witness Kong and the whites
fighting each other, a brontosaurus,
a dinosaur, a pterodactyl, a gigantic
reptile, or a huge bat—in fact all
the leading social lights of prehis
toric times.
In the end the monster is taken
back to civilization, where he es
capes and runs more or less amuck
But none of your idle milling
around yike the dinosaur in "The
Lost World" for Kong; he is looking
for Ann, who has been rescued from
his dainty clutches by her lover
and of whom he, in his apelik? way,
has grown very fond. It might be
added that he gets her and puts her
down only after an extended tour of
New York topped off by an ascent
of the Empire State Building, where
he battles to the death with four
airplanes (and soft music).
Kong, as you may have guessed
by now, is the star of this picture,
and his performance is a paragon
of mechanical perfection; he is
probably the screen's most naive
monster and is almost lovable at
times (soft music).
Fay Wray does the best and most
consistent exhibition of writhing and
screaming I have ever seen, while
Robert Armstrong apparently takes
very seriously a role which every
one else takes very lightly. Cabot
is virile enough as the hero and

performs the accepted functions in
the approved manner. Fifty million
or so extras earn their pay—danc
ing before native fires, swimming
through bogs, being trampled on by,
being pursued by, and being im
pressed by King Kong. —Chapin
DING DONG: Aristotle in the Lost
World.
In King Kong the movies have
made the great advance that they
have so long threatened, and this
Ly applying Greek philosophy to
;he scenario. The love interest is
necessarily Platonic, but the plot is
pure Aristotelian tragedy. We have
here a great character in a very
great fall brought about by a .very
tiny flaw (Fay Wray). The legiti
mate stage could never have made
this advance, not having sufficient
room. One can have a great charac
ter in a play, but unfortunately his
greatness is limited by the medium.
The movies almost discovered this
when, three years ago, they realized
that if a chorus of twelve girls
would make a charming informal
revue a chorus of twelve hundred
would be even more charming and
intimate.
Aristotle is followed carefully
thvoughout. One feels real pity for
the protagonist; the necessary terror
is supplied, but Kong's humor pre
vents it from degenerating into hor
ror; the katharsis which purges the
emotion completely is supplied when
Fay Wray embraces her more com
fortable lover atop the Empire State
Building. Indeed, the picture even
transcends Arisotle at times: Kong's
changes of size are symbolic of the
change of a man's greatness in the
various states of tragedy. Since the
movie did not have to resort to any
artificial means to impress one with
the hero's greatness, his speech was
always simple and natural. All the
dialogue was stark and plain.
The picture was, as Aristotle de
mands, an imitation of life. This was
carried out by making even the
scenery an imitation. King Kong
showed a remarkable body of per
ception, except in the genital re
gion. The censors showed remark
able aesthetic appreciation in freely

passing the picture. They had con
sidered 'Maedchen in Uniform"
;-mutty and indecent, but saw
nothing abnormal in the passionate
advances Fay VVray received from a
pterodactyl. —Zimansky

added that he gets her and puts her
down only after an extended tour of
New York topped off by an ascent
of the Empire State Building, where
he battles to the death with four
airplanes (and soft music).
Kong, as you may have guessed
by now, is the star of this picture,
and his performance is a paragon
of mechanical perfection; he is
probably the screen's most naive
monster and is almost lovable at
times (soft music).
Fay Wray does the best and most
consistent exhibition of writhing and
screaming I have ever seen, while
Robert Armstrong apparently takes
very seriously a role which every
one else takes very lightly. Cabot
is virile enough as the hero and

performs the accepted functions in
the approved manner. Fifty million
or so extras earn their pay—danc
ing before native fires, swimming
through bogs, being trampled on by,
being pursued by, and being im
pressed by King Kong. —Chapin
DING DONG: Aristotle in the Lost
World.
In King Kong the movies have
made the great advance that they
have so long threatened, and this
Ly applying Greek philosophy to
;he scenario. The love interest is
necessarily Platonic, but the plot is
pure Aristotelian tragedy. We have
here a great character in a very
great fall brought about by a .very
tiny flaw (Fay Wray). The legiti
mate stage could never have made
this advance, not having sufficient
room. One can have a great charac
ter in a play, but unfortunately his
greatness is limited by the medium.
The movies almost discovered this
when, three years ago, they realized
that if a chorus of twelve girls
would make a charming informal
revue a chorus of twelve hundred
would be even more charming and
intimate.
Aristotle is followed carefully
thvoughout. One feels real pity for
the protagonist; the necessary terror
is supplied, but Kong's humor pre
vents it from degenerating into hor
ror; the katharsis which purges the
emotion completely is supplied when
Fay Wray embraces her more com
fortable lover atop the Empire State
Building. Indeed, the picture even
transcends Arisotle at times: Kong's
changes of size are symbolic of the
change of a man's greatness in the
various states of tragedy. Since the
movie did not have to resort to any
artificial means to impress one with
the hero's greatness, his speech was
always simple and natural. All the
dialogue was stark and plain.
The picture was, as Aristotle de
mands, an imitation of life. This was
carried out by making even the
scenery an imitation. King Kong
showed a remarkable body of per
ception, except in the genital re
gion. The censors showed remark
able aesthetic appreciation in freely

passing the picture. They had con
sidered 'Maedchen in Uniform"
;-mutty and indecent, but saw
nothing abnormal in the passionate
advances Fay VVray received from a
pterodactyl. —Zimansky
"KING KONG" (R.K.0.) — \1 Uu*
Stanford Theatre.
Old King Kong was a merry old
soul, and he unwittingly provides a
very merry evening for whnesses
of his antedeluvian antics on the
silver screen. Unwittingly, one sup
poses, because King Kong was evi
dently intended as straight and
serious entertainment of tho horror
variety. Horror it is, ar.d entertain
ment is certainly is in every sense
of the word, often to the point of
hilarious laughter.
The film narrates the story of n
thrill-seeking movie director who
finds an island "never before visited
by white man," a strangely con
structed bit of landscape divided in
half by a tremendous wall. ~>n on:*
side of this lives a pet apeman
about fifty feet high, named Kong,
to whom the natives (on the ->ther
side of the fence) whimsically sacri
fice a bride on occasion. Oddly
enough, Ihe whites arrive just a f
the time of the "wedding," and,
casting convention to the winds, the
natives decide that white meat
would intrigue Kong and so capture
Ann, the leading (in fact, the only)
woman of the outfit.
The remainder of the film is di
vided between the agonies of Ann,
the pursuits of her friends, led by
her fiance (Bruce Cabot), and the
quaint machinations of Kong.
And there's nothing petty about
this picture; in rapid succession you
may witness Kong and the whites
fighting each other, a brontosaurus,
a dinosaur, a pterodactyl, a gigantic
reptile, or a huge bat—in fact all
the leading social lights of prehis
toric times.
In the end the monster is taken
back to civilization, where he es
capes and runs more or less amuck
But none of your idle milling
around yike the dinosaur in "The
Lost World" for Kong; he is looking
for Ann, who has been rescued from
his dainty clutches by her lover

Building. Indeed, the picture even
transcends Arisotle at times: Kong's
changes of size are symbolic of the
change of a man's greatness in the
various states of tragedy. Since the
movie did not have to resort to any
artificial means to impress one with
the hero's greatness, his speech was
always simple and natural. All the
dialogue was stark and plain.
The picture was, as Aristotle de

able aesthetic appreciation in freely

passing the picture. They had con
sidered 'Maedchen in Uniform"

nothing abnormal in the passionate
advances Fay VVray received from a
pterodactyl. —Zimansky
"KING KONG" (R.K.0.) — \1 Uu*
Stanford Theatre.
Old King Kong was a merry old
soul, and he unwittingly provides a
very merry evening for whnesses
of his antedeluvian antics on the
silver screen. Unwittingly, one sup
poses, because King Kong was evi
dently intended as straight and
serious entertainment of tho horror
variety. Horror it is, ar.d entertain
ment is certainly is in every sense
of the word, often to the point of
hilarious laughter.
The film narrates the story of n
thrill-seeking movie director who
finds an island "never before visited
by white man," a strangely con
structed bit of landscape divided in
half by a tremendous wall. ~>n on:*
side of this lives a pet apeman
about fifty feet high, named Kong,
to whom the natives (on the ->ther
side of the fence) whimsically sacri
fice a bride on occasion. Oddly
enough, Ihe whites arrive just a f
the time of the "wedding," and,
casting convention to the winds, the
natives decide that white meat
would intrigue Kong and so capture
Ann, the leading (in fact, the only)
woman of the outfit.
The remainder of the film is di
vided between the agonies of Ann,
the pursuits of her friends, led by
her fiance (Bruce Cabot), and the
quaint machinations of Kong.
And there's nothing petty about
this picture; in rapid succession you
may witness Kong and the whites
fighting each other, a brontosaurus,
a dinosaur, a pterodactyl, a gigantic
reptile, or a huge bat—in fact all
the leading social lights of prehis
toric times.
In the end the monster is taken
back to civilization, where he es
capes and runs more or less amuck
But none of your idle milling
around yike the dinosaur in "The
Lost World" for Kong; he is looking
for Ann, who has been rescued from
his dainty clutches by her lover
and of whom he, in his apelik? way,
has grown very fond. It might be
added that he gets her and puts her
down only after an extended tour of
New York topped off by an ascent
of the Empire State Building, where
he battles to the death with four
airplanes (and soft music).
Kong, as you may have guessed
by now, is the star of this picture,
and his performance is a paragon
of mechanical perfection; he is
probably the screen's most naive
monster and is almost lovable at
times (soft music).
Fay Wray does the best and most
consistent exhibition of writhing and
screaming I have ever seen, while
Robert Armstrong apparently takes
very seriously a role which every
one else takes very lightly. Cabot
is virile enough as the hero and

performs the accepted functions in
the approved manner. Fifty million
or so extras earn their pay—danc
ing before native fires, swimming
through bogs, being trampled on by,
being pursued by, and being im
pressed by King Kong. —Chapin
DING DONG: Aristotle in the Lost
World.
In King Kong the movies have
made the great advance that they
have so long threatened, and this
Ly applying Greek philosophy to
;he scenario. The love interest is
necessarily Platonic, but the plot is
pure Aristotelian tragedy. We have
here a great character in a very
great fall brought about by a .very
tiny flaw (Fay Wray). The legiti
mate stage could never have made
this advance, not having sufficient
room. One can have a great charac
ter in a play, but unfortunately his
greatness is limited by the medium.
The movies almost discovered this
when, three years ago, they realized
that if a chorus of twelve girls
would make a charming informal
revue a chorus of twelve hundred
would be even more charming and
intimate.
Aristotle is followed carefully
thvoughout. One feels real pity for
the protagonist; the necessary terror
is supplied, but Kong's humor pre
vents it from degenerating into hor
ror; the katharsis which purges the
emotion completely is supplied when
Fay Wray embraces her more com
fortable lover atop the Empire State
Building. Indeed, the picture even
transcends Arisotle at times: Kong's
changes of size are symbolic of the
change of a man's greatness in the
various states of tragedy. Since the
movie did not have to resort to any
artificial means to impress one with
the hero's greatness, his speech was
