Le.s Hables, who Is a great runner
bul not much shucks a.s a diplomat,
lot the 100-yard dash Saturday
when his lobbyists were out-argued
by Les Ball's lobbyists two to three
in one of the closest decisions in
Stanford-S.C. political rivalry.
The bill under discussion and
s:s proposed by Hables was to le
galize his one-foot victory over
Ball in the .'lOO-foot canter. Hables
arranged for the preliminaries and
jorced the measure through the
Ways and Means Committee in
the best Kooseveltian fashion by
winning the race itself, which
satisfied everyone except the Sen
ate for the Promulgation of South
ern California Track Victories.
That august body, however, dis
regarded the Committee's recom
mendation and declared (he
Ila hies' Kill unconstitutional (the
judges have become members of
the Supreme Court in the present
analogy).
In all fairness to Hables' redoubt
i'ble if amateurish attempts to vali
date his victory, let it be known that
a secret ballot of the Senate was
found necessary before the official
Mid therefore correct decision was
reached.
ANCIENT ORDER GIVETII WAY;
WE MUST PROGRESS
Now I am not one to disparage
ancient and accepted ways of han
dling athletic situations and I am
somewhat sentimentally attached to
the antiquated idea of considering
the best runner or jumper or throw
e>- the winner of hi.s particular event,
bul my adherance to the principles
of progress causes me heartily to
advocate the new idea of a secret
ballot to determine the winners of
all track events as proposed by the
Senate for the Promulgation of
Southern California Track Victories.
Such a plan, which will un
doubtedly be accepted in the fu
ture, would alleviate many of the
evils attaching to the present sys
tem, such as tie races and the
necessity for finish judges. For a
Senate of, perhaps, five carefully
chosen and impartial officials 1
could never consider a race a tie
and they would not need to watch
the race at all.
In fact, if this plan, which worked ,
so well down South, goes into ef- I
feet, it would prove a Heaven-sent |
gift to financially-pressed universi- |
ties. There would be no need to send j
a track team anywhere, since a |
coach would simply list his entries j
in each event and the Senate would j
then declare the winner.
PLAN WOULD INCREASE
SURVEYORS UNEMPLOYMENT
It might even be possible to dis- |
continue track as a sport and change |
it to a traditional debating society, I
since under the secret ballot plan I
the performances of individuals are j
disregarded and all their training j
and exertions for Alma Mater are !
meaningless.
As an additional attraction un- j
dc r the new system, the audience J
might be allowed a voice in the j
voting, say one vote for a 50-cent |
ticket and two for a buck ducat.
And if the crowd is not satisfied
with this method of entertainment,
races might be run too if none j
of the athletes or coaches objected,
the vote on the winner to be held
of course before the race.
Other evils that would be obliter- j
ated by this modern system would :
be the employment of County Sur
veyors to determine the winner of i
the javelin-throw—which is a most j
expensive proposition, and the un- j
couth and ungentlemanly "rough j
stuff" in the two-mile.
YOUR SCRIBE SEES ONE EVIL;
CAN ROTHERT HELP?
When this plan is accepted, it will
of course be necessary for Stanford j
to increase the excellence of her |
lobbyists, since a repetition of
Hables' dismal failure could not be !
brooked. Stanford would therefore
incorporate several new courses in 1
the curricula, such as "How to See
Across a Straight Line" and "How
tr Influence the Judges" and "Track
Diplomacy: Its Method of Approach." j
In fact. I cannot help but won
der if Jack McDowell has not
foreseen the movement and has
cidled Harlow Rothcrt hack to the
Farm in order to train him to rep
resent Stanford at the big meets
of the future. —Dick Strouse
