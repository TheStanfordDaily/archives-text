# No Freshman Tracksters To Enter Fresno Relays
## 
### 
Due to a change in the medley x*e- I
! lay event, there will be no freshman j
tracksters to run in the Fresno re- I
lays this week-end. Formerly a two- '
mile relay was held; the present j

a quarter, half, three-quarter, and
I mile for four men. Captain Nimmo
i could ably run the mile, being i
j superior in that event to any of
j the men now on the Trojan or In- j
dian varsities. Lloyd Davis would
run the half very creditably. Truck

1320 man, and neither is any other
man in the Class of '36, seemingly. I
