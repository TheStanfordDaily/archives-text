The only event of its kind of the
Pacific Coast, this relay carnival
should be a brilliant finale for a
brilliant Stanford swimming season.
Contrary to early expectations,
the San Francisco Y.M.C.A. will be
Stanford's strongest competitors in
the unlimited events. With such men
as Bill Kirschbaun, who swam for
the U.S. in the 1924 Olympic Games, ,

! Kcnry von Holt, who represented
Germany in Olympic competition,
Jack Kent, and Arnold Sellman,
taking part in the 400-yard breast
stroke and an equally strong aggre
gation in the 400-yard backstroke,
lhey will be favored to win these
events.
However, the Indians should make
up these points in the 400-yard
free-style relay and the 300-yard
medley relay. The 200-yard free
style event should be the feature of
the meet with the Y.M.C.A. and
Stanford favored. Ted Wiget. will
swim anchor for the Cards while
Frank Hadley, one of America's
outstanding dash men, will swim
against him.
Long Beach High School, South
ern California champions, and rated
by the editor of the Intercollegiate
swimming guide as the best prep
team in America, is expected _to
dominate the Class C section. They
will also enter a team in the un
limited 200-yard relay.
Cups for the winners have been
donated by Phelps-Terkel, J. Jay
Baker, Shaw Motor Company, and
, Wilsdn's Candy Company.
