# SYLLABUS DEADLINE
## 
### 
I Today is the last day for the pay
ment of syllabus fees without fine.
Following today there will be a $2
fine up to May 16, when failure to
pay will make the registration of
the student subject to cancellation.
Recent student elections at St.
Lawrence University were declared
void because the total votes exceed
ed the number of ballots handed out.
