# LAISSEZ-FAIRE IN LIMBO--COTTRELL
## 
### Dave Mellinkoff 
Laissez-faire has taken a nose
dive into the limbo of forgotten doc
trines. The United States is now en
larging upon the second step in the
relationships of government and in
dustry. ROOSEVELT and GOV
ERNMENT PARTNERSHIP in in
dustry is the credo of the day. This,
in brief, is the analysis by Dr. Edwin
A. Cottrell, Stanford professor of
political science.
The next step—government own
ership of industry—Dr. Cottrell does
not think is inevitable. For, said he,
referring to the example of the rail
roads, by appointing a Co-ordinator
of Railroads, Roosevelt is attempt
ing to avoid R.R. default to the
government.
Quote: "The rails must make,
money for investors and repay gov
ernment loans—or go into receiver
ship and turn over control to the
government."
New Deal Measures
To those who ask: "Are the New
Deal measures merely plans to wig
gle us out of the Depression"—Cot
trell answers:
"I do not think they are tempor- ;
Eiiy measures, but semi-permanent
ones which indicate a definite shift
in governmental economic policy."
In the Roosevelt requests to the ,
United States Chamber of Com
merce to limit production, and in i
the three billion dollar credit scheme I
—the Stanford professor sees veiled ;
threats to big industry and high ;
finance to ACT or BE ACTED
UPON.
Limit Production
If industry does not limit produc- (
tion, the government will. If the ;
money barons of Wall Slre'et do not
loosen credit, the government will.
Roosevelt—a "horse trader." Dr.
Cottrell believes that since the
executive must barter with foreign
diplomats, industrial leaders, gold |
hoarders, and miscellaneous par
tics, the second Whitehouse Roose
velt should be given full power in
his dealings, unhampered by the j
( Congress.
"It is good administrative prac- !
ticf to centralize control and power
in the executive—and then hold him
responsible for his actions and re
s suits obtained."
Cottrell thinks that Roosevelt
should be given much credit for
'"tiying something that might work." j
