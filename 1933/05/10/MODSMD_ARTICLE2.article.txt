# '33 Program Sale Slumps, Hits Finances
## Friday Is Last Chance To Buy Announcements 
### 
Senior Week finances will be in a
I perilous condition if the '33 gradu
i ales do not respond to the program
| and announcement sale this week,
j their last opportunity, according to
iGcne Mires, committee head.
To date but 250 programs have
j been ordered, and the sale of an
-1 nouncemenls has reached only half
j of liusl year's total, despite the fact
t that the summer graduates and ad
; vanced degree candidates whose
names are included in the Senior
Week booklets number more than
i 700.
In keeping with the reduction in
expenses of Senior Week, the com
| mittee is offering the programs for
75 cents each, the lowest price for
which the booklets have ever been
j sold. The announcements which may
i be ordered for 10 cents each are of
1 a more convenient .size than in past
years and present a conservative
! appearance, with a blending of sepia
! ink into ivory paper stock.
Since the whole sale is conducted
on an advance basis, programs and
announcement orders must be
placed this week with the A.S.S.U.
I or Alumni offices. Positively no or
! ders will be received after Friday.
