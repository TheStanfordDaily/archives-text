# Ex Committee Asks Administration Help In Theatre Project
## Conversion of War Memorial Fund to Help Proposed Building Suggested; Cost Estimated $150,000; Over $4300 in Theatre Fund Now 
### STAN BEAUBAIRE 
fjpifE Stanford student body has officially gone on record that Stanford
needs a new, modern, adequate theatre.
Ex Committee last night passed a unanimous resolution to the effect that
I the A.S.S.U. will communicate at once with the University administration
to see if this goal can be attained.
Praised by campus leaders as another step in the Jong path to the much
needed structure, the complete motion reads: "That the Executive Com
mittee request the Administration to take definite action in relation t<Â»

having the Memorial fund turned
to the purpose of erecting a Me-
morial Theatre; and, in the event
that this should not prove feasible,
J some other means be found to ac
complish this end."
Dance Planned
Following this decisive move with
equally swift action, the group
granted an all-University dance to
be given on Friday evening, June 2,
from 9 until 1 o'clock, under the
auspices of the Theatre Fund Com
mittee. All proceeds from the affair
are to be placed in the Theatre
Fund, which totals better than $4300
at present.
Although the Committee has not
had time to complete plans for the
affair, which was started spontane
ously by student suggestion last
night, it plans to present an inex
pensive event featuring a prominent
orchestra. No other organizations
are holding dances on June 2, it was
declared.
Magazines Help
Meanwhile, on all fronts, activity
increased as the widespread move
for the new Theatre continued. The
Stanford Illustrated Review, alumni
organ, appeared yesterday with
plans to revive the sizeable War
Memorial Fund and use it toward a
theatrical edifice in the future.
Chaparral brings forth a Theatre
issue tomorrow morning on the
Quad.
The plan for a War Memorial
group, which will be given in de
tail in tomorrow's Daily, originally
called for a "Memorial Hall, noble
in proportions .... and an audi
torium." Dr. William F. Durand,
professor emeritus, and chairman of
the alumni committee in charge of
the project, said at the time:
"The project is admittedly one
of large dimensions, but when
have Stanford people shrunk from
an enterprise because it was large
or difficult? The very magnitude
of the enterprise is one indeed
which should make a strong ap-
peal to the spirit of the students,
alumni, and friends of the Uni
versity."
Today the Theatre Fund Commit
tee has on hand estimates of a pro
posed Stanford theatre, based on
the best materials at depression
prices, which enables an appropriate
structure to be secured at what is
claimed to be less than half of
prices quoted five years ago. The
! new sum is $150,000, and the build
ing is too elaborate to describe in
these columns now.
Stanford men and women are once
more looking forward to expansion
and improvement, and a Greater
Stanford is in view. An enthusiastic
student body is looking forward to
| replacement of the run-down, anti
quated Assembly Hall with a mod
ern structure that can compare fa
vorably with those of other uni
versities, and with Palo Alto's new
Community Theatre, which is now
in the process of construction on
Middlefield Road, near Embarcadero.
