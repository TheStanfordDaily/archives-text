# Ex Committee Asks Administration Help In Theatre Project
## Conversion of War Memorial Fund to Help Proposed Building Suggested; Cost Estimated $150,000; Over $4300 in Theatre Fund Now 
### STAN BEAUBAIRE 
fjpifE Stanford student body has officially gone on record that Stanford
needs a new, modern, adequate theatre.
Ex Committee last night passed a unanimous resolution to the effect that
I the A.S.S.U. will communicate at once with the University administration
to see if this goal can be attained.
Praised by campus leaders as another step in the Jong path to the much
needed structure, the complete motion reads: "That the Executive Com
mittee request the Administration to take definite action in relation t<»

♦ having the Memorial r und turned
to the purpose of erecting a Me -
morial Theatre; and, in the event
I that this should not prove feasible,
J some other means be found to ac
complish this end."
Dance Planned
Following this decisive move with
i equally swift action, the group
1 granted an all-University dance to
be given on Friday evening, June 2,
from 9 until 1 o'clock, under the
auspices of the Theatre Fund Com
mittee. All proceeds from the affair
are to be placed in the Theatre
' Fund, which totals better than $4300
j at present.
Although the Committee has not
1 had time to complete plans for the
affair, which was started spontane
! ously by student suggestion last
night, it plans to present an inex
pensive event featuring a prominent
orchestra. No other organizations
| are holding dances on June 2, it was
declared.
Magazines Help
Meanwhile, on all fronts, activity
increased as the widespread move
! for the new Theatre continued. The
I Stanford Illustrated Review, alumni
organ, appeared yesterday with
plans to revive the sizeable War
i Memorial Fund and use it toward a
theatrical edifice in the future.
Chaparral brings forth a Theatre
issue tomorrow morning on the
Quad.
The plan for a War Memorial
group, which will be given in de
tail in tomorrow's Daily, originally
called for a "Memorial Hall, noble
in proportions .... and an audi
j tcrium." Dr. William F. Durand,
' professor emeritus, and chairman of
the alumni committee in charge of
j tho project, said at the time:
"The project is admittedly one
of large dimensions, but when
i have Stanford people shrunk from
an enterprise because it was large,
or difficult? The very magnitude
of the enterprise is one indeed
which should make a strong ap»
peal to the spirit of the students,
alumni, and friends of the Uni
versity."
Today the Theatre Fund Commit
tee has on hand estimates of a pro
, posed Stanford theatre, based on
1 the best materials at depression
j prices, which enables an appropriate
structure to be secured at what is
Ich imed to be less than half of
prices quoted five years ago. The
! new sum is $150,000, and the build
i irg is too elaborate to describe in
these columns now.
Stanford men and women are once
more looking forward to expansion
and improvement, and a Greater
Stanford is in view. An enthusiastic
student body is looking forward to
| replacement of the run-down, anti
quated Assembly Hall with a mod
ern structure that can compare fa
vorably with those of other uni
versities, and with Palo Alto's new
Community Theatre, which is now
;in the process of construction on
i Middlefield Road, near Embareadero.
