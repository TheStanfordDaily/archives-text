# "Illustrated Review's" Support Lends New Impetus to Theatre Drive
## 
### 
Ifs not news thai Hit' Stanford Assembly Mali is a rick
ety old barn. It's not news that the rickety old barn is
both unsafe and unsightly, it s not news that the I'niver
siln needs a new theatre and needs it badlv, nor is il news
that the War Memorial Fund has been 1 \*i 1114' unused in
Stanford coffers for fourteen years.
hut il is news when the Illustrated Review, most con
servative of Ihe Stanford campus publications and a mag
azine not given lo crying for the moon, comes out editor
ially for application of Ihe long dormant War Memorial
Fund in the student project which seeks the erection of
a new theatre in Ihe near future. The Daily, the Chapar
i(tl, and 'he students who have been petitioning Ihe I'niv
ersilv for this action without avail see new hope al this
alliance of Ihe Illustrated, hope that the administration
will permit those dreams for a new theatre to come true.
And why should Ihe I niversity not grant Ilia/ permission?
Although there may be fairly good reasons why the I ni
versity administration should refuse lo allow the War
Memorial Fund to serve a definite and immediate purpose,
those reasons are certainly not obvious. Few can doubt
I'll a I a theatre unit would provide a suitable memorial to
Stanford's war dead. None can deny that, with the funds
available, the present is the most desirable time for build
ing, and Ihe Theatre Fund Committee has found that a
beaulifu! and modern auditorium, which would have cost
lp)0,()Q0 in l'.t2<S. can now be erected at exactly half llial
figure.
Mill il seems that the original War Memorial Fund Com
mittee made plans some fourteen years ago, plans which
named "a Memorial Hall and Auditorium as the ultimate
choice." The War Memorial plans call for a group of
three uuils, the auditorium seating some seven or eight
hundred people. An auditorium of thai size would not
satisfy Stanford's present needs for a theatre and assembly
hall. Why, Ihen, should Ihe I'niversily cling lo those
plans, which, through a slight revision, could easily be
done over lo meet both the memorial and theatre pur
poses ?
The Theatre Fund Conunilee does not demand that the
I Diversity give up the idea of a War Memorial. The com
mittee seeks a new theatre, whether' il be a separate struc
ture, or whether it be a unit of Ihe original War Memorial
project. Hut the Theatre Fund Committee wants action,
and il quite correctly fails lo see the reason why the I'ni
•versily should balk al the idea of spending the memorial
funds in a way and al a lime which will bring the greatest
possible benefit lo Stanford.

a new theatre in Ihe near future. The Daily, the Chapar
i(tl, and 'he students who have been petitioning Ihe I'niv
ersilv for this action without avail see new hope al this
alliance of Ihe Illustrated, hope that the administration
will permit those dreams for a new theatre to come true.
And why should Ihe I niversity not grant Ilia/ permission?
Although there may be fairly good reasons why the I ni
versity administration should refuse lo allow the War
Memorial Fund to serve a definite and immediate purpose,
those reasons are certainly not obvious. Few can doubt
I'll a I a theatre unit would provide a suitable memorial to
Stanford's war dead. None can deny that, with the funds
available, the present is the most desirable time for build
ing, and Ihe Theatre Fund Committee has found that a
beaulifu! and modern auditorium, which would have cost
lp)0,()Q0 in l'.t2<S. can now be erected at exactly half llial
figure.
Mill il seems that the original War Memorial Fund Com
mittee made plans some fourteen years ago, plans which
named "a Memorial Hall and Auditorium as the ultimate
choice." The War Memorial plans call for a group of
three uuils, the auditorium seating some seven or eight
hundred people. An auditorium of thai size would not
satisfy Stanford's present needs for a theatre and assembly
hall. Why, Ihen, should Ihe I'niversily cling lo those
plans, which, through a slight revision, could easily be
done over lo meet both the memorial and theatre pur
poses ?
The Theatre Fund Conunilee does not demand that the
I Diversity give up the idea of a War Memorial. The com
mittee seeks a new theatre, whether' il be a separate struc
ture, or whether it be a unit of Ihe original War Memorial
project. Hut the Theatre Fund Committee wants action,
and il quite correctly fails lo see the reason why the I'ni
•versily should balk al the idea of spending the memorial
funds in a way and al a lime which will bring the greatest
possible benefit lo Stanford.
Ifs not news thai Hit' Stanford Assembly Mali is a rick
ety old barn. It's not news that the rickety old barn is
both unsafe and unsightly, it s not news that the I'niver
siln needs a new theatre and needs it badlv, nor is il news
that the War Memorial Fund has been 1 \*i 1114' unused in
Stanford coffers for fourteen years.
hut il is news when the Illustrated Review, most con
servative of Ihe Stanford campus publications and a mag
azine not given lo crying for the moon, comes out editor
ially for application of Ihe long dormant War Memorial
Fund in the student project which seeks the erection of
a new theatre in Ihe near future. The Daily, the Chapar
