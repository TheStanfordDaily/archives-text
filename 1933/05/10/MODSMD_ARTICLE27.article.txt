This story of doings on the campus across the hay
conies from unverified sources, Imt it's too good a yarn to
pass by without comment.
tl seems that one of Berkeley's finest happened upon
two students early one morning recently; they were sup
porting a third student who seemed to he pretty tired.
"You see," they began, "it's this way. Finals are coming
this week, and all our examinations arc graded on a class
average basis. Jf the class-average in our finals is low,
we'll pass.
"So we've made a contract with our pal here that in
return for our supplying him with dates and refreshments,
he'll flunk his lin;ils and lower the average enough for us
to pass."
This is a shocking story. The only admirable part of
the situation is the ingenuity displayed. As for the third
member of the scheme well, limes are hard evervwhere.
