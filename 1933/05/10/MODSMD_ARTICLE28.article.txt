## AH, SWEET MYSTERY OF REST 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
My first (and last) contact with
the Rest Home, while very strange,
| was also very pleasing. It was my
i Encina year—a very strange thing
i of course in itself. The psychology
I department wanted to test the me
| tabolism of white rats, but the crop
; of white rats was u flop that year
| so they went over to Encina instead,
j We were taken to the Rest Home
I for the Great Experiment—noble, as
i experiments always are.
Having recently finished registra-
I lion, medical examination, and pur
; chase of Big Game tickets, I was of
j course resigned to a long waiting in
) a long line. In fact, I lined up with-
I out being told. It was a reflex ac
tion by this time—to be u bit be
havioristic. Imagine my unbelieving
surprise when I was made to feel at
home—in a place which, while lack
ing the rigorous simplicity of En
cina ruggedness, was a damn sight
more comfortable.
My short stay at the Rest Home
j that time has always been a tender
{ memory of my first year. I have
often hoped that 1 would suffer a
nervous breakdown, become under
i weight—or something terrifying so
■ that I could return to the soft beds
| and good food of that Rest Home
j experience. Unfortunately, that has
; never happened. My nerves refuse
j to become shattered; my weight re
-1 fuses to go under I live in hope;
I that is all.
j Every day I read the list of lucky
i stiffs who contract something or
I other and are sent to the Rest Home.

! Theirs is a happy lot indeed. My
life at Stanford has been a series |
of recurring envious regrets. But j
some were born to live on army cots
and the rest were designed to live |
in Rest Home luxury. Each must j
play his part with silenoe and resig
nation.
But of course this Rest Home can
not subsist on nothing. It requires
funds. So the Mothers' Club is hav
ing a Garden Fete today in Los Al
tos —which promises to be quite the
thing to attend if the number of
boys who are having their two-tone
shoes polished is any criterion. The
Daily, always first with the latest,
prints all the details on the front
page. The fee of 50 cents i.s only
possible because of the donations
and work of the women concerned.
The Mothers' Club will not even
i have to pay a "maintenance fee"
because the affair will be held at
the home of Mrs. Paul Shoup
not the Women's gym of Dr. Bertha
Dyment.
A woman's hand is something
more than a thing to hold in the
moonlight. The "woman's hand" is
making possible the Rest Homes—
(one for the men and another for
the women, the dears). Anyone can
hold a hand in the moonlight—if |
there is a hand to hold and if there I
is any moonlight. We can uphold i
the hand of the Mothers' Club this i
afternoon. If you can't make it, drop [
a "P.S." in the next letter home j
and have your mother send $ melm- !
mership fee to the Mothers' Club. ,
It would help.

A woman's hand is something
more than a thing to hold in the
moonlight. The "woman's hand" is
making possible the Rest Homes—
(one for the men and another for
the women, the dears). Anyone can
hold a hand in the moonlight—if |
there is a hand to hold and if there I
is any moonlight. We can uphold i
the hand of the Mothers' Club this i
afternoon. If you can't make it, drop [
a "P.S." in the next letter home j
and have your mother send $ melm- !
mership fee to the Mothers' Club. ,
It would help.
My first (and last) contact with
the Rest Home, while very strange,
| was also very pleasing. It was my
i Encina year—a very strange thing
i of course in itself. The psychology
I department wanted to test the me
| tabolism of white rats, but the crop
; of white rats was u flop that year
| so they went over to Encina instead,
j We were taken to the Rest Home
I for the Great Experiment—noble, as
i experiments always are.
Having recently finished registra-
I lion, medical examination, and pur
; chase of Big Game tickets, I was of
j course resigned to a long waiting in
) a long line. In fact, I lined up with-
I out being told. It was a reflex ac
tion by this time—to be u bit be
havioristic. Imagine my unbelieving
surprise when I was made to feel at
home—in a place which, while lack
ing the rigorous simplicity of En
cina ruggedness, was a damn sight
more comfortable.
My short stay at the Rest Home
j that time has always been a tender
{ memory of my first year. I have
often hoped that 1 would suffer a
nervous breakdown, become under
i weight—or something terrifying so
■ that I could return to the soft beds
| and good food of that Rest Home
j experience. Unfortunately, that has
; never happened. My nerves refuse
j to become shattered; my weight re
-1 fuses to go under I live in hope;
I that is all.
j Every day I read the list of lucky
i stiffs who contract something or
I other and are sent to the Rest Home.

! Theirs is a happy lot indeed. My
life at Stanford has been a series |
of recurring envious regrets. But j
some were born to live on army cots
and the rest were designed to live |
in Rest Home luxury. Each must j
play his part with silenoe and resig
nation.
But of course this Rest Home can
not subsist on nothing. It requires
funds. So the Mothers' Club is hav
ing a Garden Fete today in Los Al
tos —which promises to be quite the
thing to attend if the number of
boys who are having their two-tone
shoes polished is any criterion. The
Daily, always first with the latest,
prints all the details on the front
page. The fee of 50 cents i.s only
possible because of the donations
and work of the women concerned.
