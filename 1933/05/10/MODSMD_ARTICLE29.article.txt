I CAVALCADE AGAIN—With some
cinematic history.
It would be more repetition to
: comment upon the virtues of Caval-
J cade (current at the Mountain View
I Theatre), but there is obviously still
1 reason for additional consideration
j of the film in comparison with
i others.
j To advertise il as "greater than
| The Birth of a Nation" is one with
j advertising it as greater than, for
i instance, East Lynne or Ten Nights
| in a Bar-Room.
I Cavalcade is infinitely finer than
j the old D. W. Griffith film which, in
recent revival, was seen to be no
i more than the cheapest of melo
j drama become, with time, only a
j curious relic.
| The Birth of a Nation is of no im-
I portance as a human historical doc
! ument; Cavalcade may well be. The
: Birth of a Nation reveals a trend of
j thought now cast aside; Cavalcade,
1 disregarding its perhaps shallow
J method, is based upon universal
| ideas and ideals which have stirred
I men through the ages.
The importance of the earlier film
a.s an example of cinematic history
alone, is undeniable. It introduced
I the close-up and began realistic
; production. Painted interiors gave
w;.y rapidly after its trenmendous
I success, to solid interiors, and con
! sistent long shots were varied by
| insertion of shots at closer range
1 which revealed better the minute
I changes of expression. Griffith's new
! technique in its two aspects at once
; freed the film from the confinement
| of the small stage, and permitted a

] far subtler treatment of individual i
performances.
| That the close-up has been mis- j
used does not invalidate the fact j
that, through its use such delicacies, j
such nuances as a Barrymore or a i
Jannings give to a characterization, !
h:.ve been possible. And the fact j
that De Mille has vulgarized fine j
I literature by representing it as a i
! series of colossal orgies, does not}
remove the fact that mob scenes j
permitted by large-scale production!
can be tremendously effective.
Now granting that all this has !
, arisen from the Griffith film, it does j
not follow that the film is a great j
human document. It is a step in the j
history of a mechanical progress |
and, while deserving credit as such,!
1 deserves no more. —Sandoc
