A question which will comc be
fore the Senior Class in its meeting
in the next few days will be what
this year's graduating class will do
about the custom of pledges, by
such seniors as are able, to con
tribute annually a certain sum, large
or small, to the University in the
years after graduation. During the
last few years the funds thus col
lected have gone to an emergency
fund administered at the discretion
of the President and the Board of
Trustees. The total sum of money
paid under these pledges, which
have always been revocable when
the circumstances of the donor so
dictate, has averaged about four
hundred dollars a year lor each
class in the best of times, and of
course less of late.
The advantages of devoting the
proceeds of the pledges of gradu
ating seniors to a discretionary iund
in the hands of the University ad
ministration are evident, as against
devoting them to some specific gilt.
The University is the best judge of
its own needs. But some members
I of the present graduating class have
i raised the question of whether it
would not be better for the pro
ceeds of the class's pledges to be
devoted to establishing scholar
ships? Wouldn't the students ralher
pledge contributions for something
tangible to which they can point as
the result of the co-operative effort
of their class? As compared with
i the older Eastern universities, does
-1 n'l Stanford need to swell its list of
1 scholarships? Wouldn't students
rather pledge to give something
whose benefit to students is so evi
dently direct, as in the case of schol
arships? Would not students pledge
more for this purpose? Most of us
know of highly qualified students
who have been lost to Stanford be
cause of the high costs; many of
these adding by their enrollment to
the standards of the university of
their second choice, and this despite
Stanford's commendably liberal tui
-1 tion-note policy. Would not the best
use of the proceeds of graduating
i class pledges be toward bringing
these students to Stanford?
j I am not bringing this proposal to
. light as an outright recommendation,
I but in the hope that the members
j of the Class of 1933 will give these
j two alternatives careful thought be
fore coming to the class meeting,
j There we must make a decision, and

The Editor, Sir:
Judging from the frequent un
pleasant remarks 1 have overheard
on the subject of Assembly Hall
seats, I think it should not be dif
ficult to direct campus sentiment
toward the building of a new thea
tre. But our combination classroom,
assembly hall, and theatre is not
only uncomfortable and drafty; it is
dangerous. It is a fire hazard, and
why the plaster is still in place is a
phenomenon unexplained by the
laws of nature and mechanics. It has
been threatening to fall for some
time and presents a constant men
ace.
The structure from the point of
view of the actor and director is an
even greater problem. Action and
sets must be adjusted so as to be
seen from the seats in the out
dated horseshoe curves. The stage is
so small that when a set is iidequutc
for dramatic action, there is no room
to move or store extra flats between
the set and the theatre wall. It is
impossible to fly scenery, and the
lighting must frequently be make
shift. The dressing-rooms are hor
rible. It is true —no one has broken a
leg descending the stairs to the
dressing-rooms—yet.
But Stanford University has no
right to submit students and guests
to the discomforts and dangers that
characterize our theatre.

Judging from the frequent un
pleasant remarks 1 have overheard
on the subject of Assembly Hall
seats, I think it should not be dif
ficult to direct campus sentiment
toward the building of a new thea
tre. But our combination classroom,
assembly hall, and theatre is not
only uncomfortable and drafty; it is
dangerous. It is a fire hazard, and
why the plaster is still in place is a
phenomenon unexplained by the
laws of nature and mechanics. It has
been threatening to fall for some
time and presents a constant men
ace.
The structure from the point of
view of the actor and director is an
even greater problem. Action and
sets must be adjusted so as to be
seen from the seats in the out
dated horseshoe curves. The stage is
so small that when a set is iidequutc
for dramatic action, there is no room
to move or store extra flats between
the set and the theatre wall. It is
impossible to fly scenery, and the
lighting must frequently be make
shift. The dressing-rooms are hor
rible. It is true —no one has broken a
leg descending the stairs to the
dressing-rooms—yet.
But Stanford University has no
right to submit students and guests
to the discomforts and dangers that
characterize our theatre.

A question which will comc be
fore the Senior Class in its meeting
in the next few days will be what
this year's graduating class will do
about the custom of pledges, by
such seniors as are able, to con
tribute annually a certain sum, large
or small, to the University in the
years after graduation. During the
last few years the funds thus col
lected have gone to an emergency
fund administered at the discretion
of the President and the Board of
Trustees. The total sum of money
paid under these pledges, which
have always been revocable when
the circumstances of the donor so
dictate, has averaged about four
hundred dollars a year lor each
class in the best of times, and of
course less of late.
The advantages of devoting the
proceeds of the pledges of gradu
ating seniors to a discretionary iund
in the hands of the University ad
ministration are evident, as against
devoting them to some specific gilt.
The University is the best judge of
its own needs. But some members
I of the present graduating class have
i raised the question of whether it
would not be better for the pro
ceeds of the class's pledges to be
