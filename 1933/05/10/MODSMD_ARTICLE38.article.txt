"And now," said the suave voice
oi the regular Columbia-Don
announcer, "I will turn the micro
phono over to Garry Breckner. He
will tell you all about the great track
meet today between Stanford and
Southern California, down in Los
Angeles."
And Breckner told us:
"There go the Stanford javelin
throwers," began Gurry. "There's
Moat ram and Ernie Tarbuckle and
who's thai left-handed one? Oh, yes,
that's Bob Quinn of S.C.; he throws
wilh either hand. Whattaman!
"Its the hundred. They're on iheir
marks. Charley Paddock has just
won the race. No, my mistake; Par
sons broke. They're on their marks
again. Ball is in front. Hables comes
up fast and nips him at the tape.
No, it's Lombardi's race; Lombardi
ol Stanford is the winner. But wait,
I think that Charley Parsons edged
in there somewhere. Yes, unofficial
results find Ball first, Parsons sec
end, and Hables third.
"Bjst that's not right: I'm sure
that Lombardi won. Lombardi won
wilh Iluhles second. But here
tome the official results. The
judges are taking a secret ballot;
they're taking a glass of milk
apiece to strengthen them for the
job. The race was so close .that
they're jilting a secret ballot, lull
anyway I do know the time: il
was 10-flat.
"And now look at the pole-vault.
Hec Edmundsen has just vaulted 14
feet; no, that was George Edmonds
going over 11 feet, (> inches. Bill
Miller is vaulting; he clears it
clearly."
And poor old Bill, listening to the
meet over the radio at the Deke
house, wondered if he were twins.
But was Breckner dismayed?
Hardly. Hardly at all, my friends.
"In the shot-put," continued
Garry, "Johnny Lyman is leading
with a put of 52 feet, (i inches. Fifty
two-six feet, it is. and it breaks the
Stanford record. No, I'm wrong, I'm
afraid: Lyman is now running into
third place in the shot-put.
"It's the 140. Warburton's away
fast. lie's out in front. He's run
ning second. Warburlon is tying
up; now he's third. Warburlon
comes out of it: he's battling it out
for fourth place. Oh, hoy, you
should see that hoy sprint; YVar
hurton wins fourth place by a
stride, but of course there are no
points for fourth place.
"Oh, yes, Ablowich won the 440
wilh Blackmail second and Tomp
kins third. But did that hoy War
burton run!"
Someone arranged to run the
Kentucky Derby then, so that
Breckner could get his breath.
Clem McCarthy announced the
Derby. "They're at the post," he
began, "and Ladysman is acting like
a perfect gentleman, as a ladies' man
rightly should.
"Broker's Tip wins the Darby,''
said Clem some minutes later. "I
guess (his is a year of prosperity.
That is the first good broker's tip
I've had in years.
"And now. concluded McCarthy,
"Attorney General James A. Farley
will tell you about the Darby. Come
on, postman, say a few words.
"Johnny Muttrum," came back
Breckner, fresh again after the short
interlude, "is two-thirds of an inch
behind in the javelin. Maybe it's
only one-half an inch; I cant tell
very well from here.
"Results of the 880-yard run. Web
ster of Southern California, first.
Cassin of Southern California, third.
Saffel of Southern California, fourth.
And Sam Eastman of Stanford fin
ished second.
"In (he broad-jump, Zacks of
Stanford is leading. No, it's Zachees
of Slanford. They're setting up the
low hurdles. Norman Paul is run
ning way out in front. Herbert of
Stanford is second, but he's 20 yards
behind. My, oh my; Paul just tied
the world's record in the 220-yard
low hurdles.
"Would you like to hear from
Norman Paul, who has just tied the
world's broad-jump record? Come
here, Norman, and say something.

(Anything will do.)"
"Why," said Paul, "I would just
like lo say that I was lucky to
bcal Herbert: he was sure closing
up on me in the last 40 yards and
was only a few feet behind at (he
finish."
And, as • music filled the air,
Breckner, apparently still happy,
concluded with: "My. what is that?
Oh, yes; it's the S.C. band out there,
giving us a little .... uh, ah, . . . .
noise." —Dick Strouse
