# Alumnus Discovers New Whooping Cough Vaccine
## 
### 
A new vaccine for whooping
cough, called pertussis antigen, has
been discovered by Dr. Albert Paul
Krueger, who graduated from Stan
ford in 1926 and received his M.D.
from the Medical School in 1929.
Dr. W. H. Manwaring, bacteriology
professor under whom Krueger
worked while at Stanford, said that
the vaccine is the first of the new
undenatured vaccines discovered
under the theory modern bacteriolo
gists hold, that bacilli are plastic
and not static.
Canada produces eight per cent of
the world's supply of asbestos.
