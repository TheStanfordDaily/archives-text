# YOUNG SOLOIST SCORES VIOLIN TRIUMPH HERE
## Large Audience Is Moved By Last Numbers In Yehudi's Program 
### Ellamae Dodds 
Beginning coldly, almost mechan
] ically, Yehudi Menuhin in his Stan
ford concert last night grew in
creasingly masterful with each num
: ber until he aroused an intense en
thusiasm with his interpretation of
his last group and a veritable tri
umph in his final encore number,
the "Ave Maria."
Giving much individual interpre
j tat ion and expression to the ever
popular "Hungarian Dance No. 7"
I by Brahms and Joachim, the 16-
i year-old violinist warmed up
| quickly to the enthusiasm of his
| listeners and completed his program
j with constantly increasing spirit.
Outstanding for an exceptional
; left-hand pizzicato, Yehudi's rendi
| tier. of "The Dance of the Goblins"
by Bazzini called for a complete
j repetition of the number.
Although the rather heavy Bach
j "Sonata in E Major" lacked the fire
| and youthful spirit of his later num
! bers, Yehudi's playing of it was
technically good and notable mostly
! for deftness of touch and speed in
the last Allegro movement. The
youthful violinist achieved a musi-
I cal, romantic, and lyric quality sel
dom found in interpretations of this
; selection.
Extremely good cadenzas and
; trills and runs combined with a
; flowing, beautiful tone quality with
j effective contracts were outstanding.
A near-capacity crowd, intensely
! enthusiastic from the beginning of
! the third group of numbers, assured
i the continuance of the Concert
| Series for another year and indi
j cated that Stanford is not lacking in
j appreciation of artistic and cultural
| presentations.
Although hailed as a mature art
ist now, Yehudi seemed last night
the boy prodigy which he has been
j acclaimed for the last nine years.
Even in his final numbers, he never
I once lapsed into sentimentality, al
j though he did achieve a remarkable
j spiritual quality in his "Ave Maria."
j Three encore selections and full
j repetition of two numbers, the
| "Hungarian Dance No. 7" and "The
Dance of the Goblins," were neces-
I sary to satisfy the large and appre-
J ciative audience.
