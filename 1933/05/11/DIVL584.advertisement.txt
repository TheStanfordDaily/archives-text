Vocal cords
made of coalt
Typical of Western Electric care and precision
in manufacturing Hell Telephone apparatus, is the
making of the transmitter button which transforms
spoken words into electrical impulses.
This transmitter button—the telephone's vocal
cords —contains coal. Only a fine grade of se
lected anthracite, specially treated, is suited for
this delicate work, Hrst.the coal is ground into
fine granular form —next it is carefully sifted and
washed. Then, after being roasted in special ovens,
it is put into the transmitter button. Approxi
mately 50,000 tiny grains must go into each button
—too few or too many would impair transmission.
Such infinite care with "little things" is one rea
son why Hell System apparatus serves so faithfully.
