# Prom Bids Go On Sale Today
## Plans For Decorations At Dance Announced 
### 
Atmosphere that tantalizes and an
oLchestra that fairly scintillates. All
of which will add to the string of
surprises promised for the Junior
Prom next Friday evening, May 19,
in the Women's Gym.
Placing the guests right in the
midst of Spring, the entire building
will be transformed into a Spanish
hacienda garden, Herb Sanderson
announced last night. The walls of
the dance salon will be covered with
I'. wers clinging to lattice-work,
while shrubs will be placed through
the setting for the dance.

As a special feature of the affair,
the patio will be specially arranged
with hammocks and garden swings
placed about the grounds. From
huge umbrella-covered tables set
around the fountain in the middle,
punch will be served. At the north
c ncl of the dancing room, there will
be a gigantic early California Mis
sion setting. Colored lighting effects
will play upon the dance floor to
complete the details.
In order to guarantee as perfect
an evening as possible to the Class
of '34 and its friends, Sanderson de
clared that the professional services
of the J. L. Stuart Company and
their staff of artisans have been se
cured to attend to the problem of
decorations. Marc Krupp is in
charge of the student committee
which is arranging for this work.
