# Stanford War Memorial Fund Over $150,000 Mark

### RUSSELL PAINE 
That body of money known as the
"Stanford War Memorial Fund,"
now in the hands of the University,
totaled $147,826.23 on August 31,
1932. Today, with over six months'
accrued interest to be added there
to, should place the total sum well
above the $150,000 mark.
Coincidentally with the movement
for a new theatre for Stanford, there
came the suggestion that the Uni
versity be asked to convert this sum
into a Memorial Theatre Fund. The
original fund was started in 1919,
rnd was given to the Administra
tion for the purpose of erecting a
suitable memorial to the some three
thousand or more alumni who par
ticipated in the World War. The
fund must be used for a structure
that is memorial in nature.*
Back as far as March 31, 1919, the
original Alumni Committee of Fifty
decided upon the selection of a
"Memorial Hall and Auditorium" to

1 be the goal of the group. The audi
toiium mentioned, however, was to
seat only between seven and eight
1 hundred people.
Again, in 1929, when plans were
revived, the University architects
prepared the sketch which appeared
on yesterday's front page of the
Daily. This. new conception com
bined the future ideal of a memorial
group into a proposed second quad
| rangle.
Today the Theatre Fund Commit
tee of the A.S.S.U. has organized to
rc&ch the goal long sought after by
i Stanford organizations. It is at
tempting to secure a theatre for
Stanford by some means, and as
one alternative has asked the Ad
ministration to use that Memorial
Fund to build a Memorial Theatre
which would certainly be all that
the original donors had in mind
when they contributed their funds
: to the creation of a future War Me-
I morial.
