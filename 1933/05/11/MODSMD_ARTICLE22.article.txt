# PARAGUAY HEAD DECLARES WAR AGAINST BOLIVIA
## Declaration Climaxes Year Of Fighting Between Two Countries 
### 
ASUNCION, Paraguay, May 10 j
| (/P) â€”Paraguay formally declared 1
war today against Bolivia after 11 !
months of fighting between the two j
nations in the Gran Chaco border |
area.
The dispute over the vast, form- I
less wilderness comprising .'{oo,ooo j
square miles of swamps, forests, and
plains has antedated the independ- ;
ent existence of either nation, and j
by today's declaration Paraguay!
tacitly invited Argentina, Brazil,
Chile, and Peru to blockade its j
coastless foe.
The Chaco is important to Bolivia,!
which has no outlet to the .sea, be- i
cause it would mean a river route j
to Buenos Aires. To Paraguay the ;
j disputed territory represents about j
j half the area of the nation.
News that President Eusebio j
i Ayala had signed the declaration
j under authority recently tfiven him
I by Congress inspired wild demon- j
! strations among Paraguayans, who
I feel the move will lead South Amer- ;
! ican nations to blockade Bolivia and
i
I force the enemy to capitulate by j
j balking importations.
This was the first declaration j
of war in South America, except j
for the belated entry of several I
South American nations into the j
World War, since 1879, when Ho- |
livia fought against Chile over the
nitrate fields.
A nation-wide state of siege was J
established in Paraguay today. The j
League of Nations was notified of j
the government's act.
With casualties aggregating more !
than 35,000 since July, the combat- j
ants'now are mostly conserving their i
forces for a decisive action.
