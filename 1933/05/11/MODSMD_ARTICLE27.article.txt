# Theatre Question May Be Brought Before Trustees
## President Wilbur May Broach Subject to University Board at Meeting Today; Student Project Calls For Alteration of Original Plans 
### STAN BEAUBAIRE 
J HIS afternoon at 1:45 o'clock the Stanford Board of Trustees will con -
vene in the Balfour Building in San Francisco. And this noon, or
possibly earlier, President Ka> Lyman Wilbur will leave his administrative
offices to attend that important meeting.
As continued activity in the drive for a theatre increased with new
developments, hope for any definite action today was said to lie with
these men who are in direct charge of the University's affairs. Whether
or not l)r. Wilbur will broach the subject today could not be determined

last night because of his absence
from the campus.
Any project of this nature is cus
tomarily raised by the University
president, and is then considered by
members of the Board of Trustees.
Following the Ex Committee reso
lution yesterday asking the Presi
dent to investigate the matter on
behalf of the Stanford student body,
it is expected that some action at
least will result from the meeting.
Original Plans
Although the original plans of the
War Memorial fund which arc out
lined elsewhere on this page called
for a complete memorial group of
buildings, the Theatre Fund Com
mittee has contemplated a separate
structure, in the original student
plans, which would be an independ
ent Stanford theatre, the best that
the money available could purchase.
The tentative plans suggested by
the student group called for a struc
ture which would face the Chemis
try building, on the old Library site
flanking the road from Palm Drive
up to Lasucn where the two meet
at the Art Gallery site.
Would Scat 1950
This theatre would include dia
matic offices and a Green Room
and would seat some 1950 persons.
Suggestions were further made to
include a little theatre in the base
ment floor and possibly an open
air Greek-type theatre built upon
a sounding board on the rear wail
and extending back across the spa
cious field that is now empty.
When it, was decided to ask for
the War Memorial Fund for use in
this proposed structure, a large and
appropriate memorial hall was in
cluded in these plans, with alcoves
suitable for memorial appurtenances
to be placed in the auditorium itself.
To Clost $150,000
This building, estimated at de
pression prices and quoting the best
materials, would cost $150,000 and
would include a $10,000 switchboard.
It would have the same type ex
terior as the rest of the campus
halls.
Campus leaders believe that
whether this plan of a separate
theatre is adopted or the original
idea of a memorial group to include
a theatre is undertaken is not, th' x
important question today. They
maintain that what should corjio
first is the fact that Stanford needs
a new theatre, that it should be:
j large enough to accommodate all
'campus needs, and that it should be:
placed under construction as soon
as possible.
J HIS afternoon at 1:45 o'clock the Stanford Board of Trustees will con -

developments, hope for any definite action today was said to lie with
these men who are in direct charge of the University's affairs. Whether
or not l)r. Wilbur will broach the subject today could not be determined

last night because of his absence
from the campus.
Any project of this nature is cus
tomarily raised by the University
president, and is then considered by
members of the Board of Trustees.
Following the Ex Committee reso
lution yesterday asking the Presi
dent to investigate the matter on
behalf of the Stanford student body,
it is expected that some action at
least will result from the meeting.
Original Plans
Although the original plans of the
War Memorial fund which arc out
lined elsewhere on this page called
for a complete memorial group of
buildings, the Theatre Fund Com
mittee has contemplated a separate
structure, in the original student
plans, which would be an independ
ent Stanford theatre, the best that
the money available could purchase.
The tentative plans suggested by
the student group called for a struc
ture which would face the Chemis
try building, on the old Library site
flanking the road from Palm Drive
up to Lasucn where the two meet
at the Art Gallery site.
Would Scat 1950
This theatre would include dia
matic offices and a Green Room
and would seat some 1950 persons.
Suggestions were further made to
include a little theatre in the base
ment floor and possibly an open
air Greek-type theatre built upon
a sounding board on the rear wail
and extending back across the spa
cious field that is now empty.
When it, was decided to ask for
the War Memorial Fund for use in
this proposed structure, a large and
appropriate memorial hall was in
cluded in these plans, with alcoves
suitable for memorial appurtenances
to be placed in the auditorium itself.
To Clost $150,000
This building, estimated at de
pression prices and quoting the best
materials, would cost $150,000 and
would include a $10,000 switchboard.
It would have the same type ex
terior as the rest of the campus
halls.
Campus leaders believe that
whether this plan of a separate
theatre is adopted or the original
idea of a memorial group to include
a theatre is undertaken is not, th' x
important question today. They
maintain that what should corjio
first is the fact that Stanford needs
a new theatre, that it should be:
j large enough to accommodate all
'campus needs, and that it should be:
placed under construction as soon
as possible.
J HIS afternoon at 1:45 o'clock the Stanford Board of Trustees will con -
vene in the Balfour Building in San Francisco. And this noon, or
possibly earlier, President Ka> Lyman Wilbur will leave his administrative
offices to attend that important meeting.
As continued activity in the drive for a theatre increased with new
developments, hope for any definite action today was said to lie with
these men who are in direct charge of the University's affairs. Whether
or not l)r. Wilbur will broach the subject today could not be determined
