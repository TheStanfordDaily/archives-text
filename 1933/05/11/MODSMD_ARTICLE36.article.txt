# Trustee Plan vs. Student Planâ€” Must Stanford Wait Forever for a Theatre?
## 
### 
I lie Stanford trustees meet this afternoon, and perhaps
when (I icy push Iheir chairs hack froin the table in ad
journment the dream for ;i new theatre on the Farm will
he a step closer realization. And then again it may not.
But whether or not the question receives oflicial consider
ation at today's meeting in San Francisco, the matter of a
new theatre is one which the Hoard of Trustees can
.scarcely fail to decide at some dale in the near future.
1 he recently rejuvenated Theatre Fund Committee has
a constructive plan which certainly merits the careful ap
praisal of the trustees. The trustees have a plan, too, made
Mime fourteen years ago, which apparently still strikes
Iheir fancy. And inseparably entangled with Ihe fourteen
year-old Hoard of Trustees' plan and the new student plan
is still another plan that of Ihe War Memorial Committee
ol Thai group, appointed to raise money and plan
the construction of a suitable memorial to the t'nivcrsitv's
World War dead, decided upon Ihe erection of a memo
rial hall and auditorium and gathered funds which have
since accrued to a figure slightly over $1 ;">(),()()(>.
Then Ihe trustees made their plan. The War Memorial
bund would be used to erect a unit of the visionary "Li
brary Quadrangle," a unit which should house an audi
torium with a sealing capacity of seven or eight hundred
persons, a memorial hall, and a Hoover War Library. II
was a good plan. II still is, and it still will be a decade
from now, when the I diversity's million-dollar building
dreams will slill be far short of realization. Hut in those
years which must necessarily intervene between the pres
ent and the day when ground will be broken for the Hoard
of Trustees' \\ ar Memorial, will Stanford have to hold its
theatricals and its assemblies in Ihe antedated, ramshackle
Assembly Hall?
I lie student I heatre Fund Committee answers "No,"
and oilers its plan, which calls for immediate construction
ol a new theatre and assembly hall with the War Memorial
Fund, I hereby suggesting an entirely feasible solution to
Ihe theatre problem and a perfectly sound and desirable
method of pulling Ihe memorial funds into concrete use
within the lifetime of the donors.
