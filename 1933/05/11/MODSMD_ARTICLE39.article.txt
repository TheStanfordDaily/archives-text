# BULL SESSION
## STICK WHERE YOU MAY 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
I love the Convalescent Home I
Kiddies—every one—bless their lit
tle hearts. Poor little unfortunates.
I wouldn't want to do anything that
would hurt them in the least. They
need money. The campus has money.
The Horn? gets it. That is very fine,
indeed. Some people use the Drive
to advance their political fortunes.
That is to be expected. Every char
ity movement has its share of
leeches.
\
But one thing happened during
this Drive that annoyed me. I re
strained myself, however, for I did
n't want seme "butch" by someone
to hurt the Kiddies. After all, they
i weren't to blame for what someone
' over here did. The reference is to
the plastering of windshields with
I placards—gay in color but annoying
j in application. j
The annoyance is not personal. I
own nothing large enough upon j
| which anyone could stick one of
i these Home displays. My typewriter
! is in my room and my back is near
j enough to my legs to escape all
plastering efforts. I am placard
proof. But those lucky unfortunates i
! who own automobiles awoke one !
afternoon to the realization that ra
zoi blades and water would be the I
order of the day. Enthusiastic work- 1
err in a charitable lather had
smeared these things without con
! sent of the owners.
Practically, it was bad. It irked
some people so severely that they
refused to contribute to the Home
this year. Many removed the things

out of spite. No one was pleased.
It would have been much better to
ask peopls to carry the placards.
Forcing people never gets anywhere
—at least not in charity work.
Theoretically, it is highly annoy
ing to witness the self-sufficient at
titude of anyone who is doing some
thing worthwhile. Because these
people are engaged in doing "good
work," they presume immediately
that the world is their ship and they
are the ceptains, cooks, crew, and
propellers as well. They putter
around like little kids in their nur
sery. They arc presumptive in the
extreme. This plastering is one of
the more pestiferous examples of
that presumptiveness.
But the Convalescent Home Drive
is not the only sinner. There Was
once an unknown "midnight marau
der"' who stuck prohibition propa
ganda over campus automobiles.
That was particularly annoying; the
evil taste remaining in the mouth
after many bottles of beer. If it i
came to a showdown, I would rather
carry "Kiddie Blurb" than "Vol
stead Vagaries"—but both are par
ticularly obnoxious.
The Military Ball also bitten
by the same bug. They not only
splattered cards all over the cam
pus in general, with their great air
plane idea, but stuck up the wind
shields as well, si nothing sacred?
The facade of the Memorial Church
alone has escaped. But wait, there
is a Toyan Dance Saturday. I must
dash over and take a look at the
Memorial Church.

afternoon to the realization that ra
zoi blades and water would be the I
order of the day. Enthusiastic work- 1
err in a charitable lather had
smeared these things without con
! sent of the owners.
Practically, it was bad. It irked
some people so severely that they
refused to contribute to the Home
this year. Many removed the things

out of spite. No one was pleased.
It would have been much better to
ask peopls to carry the placards.
Forcing people never gets anywhere
—at least not in charity work.
Theoretically, it is highly annoy
ing to witness the self-sufficient at
titude of anyone who is doing some
thing worthwhile. Because these
people are engaged in doing "good
work," they presume immediately
that the world is their ship and they
are the ceptains, cooks, crew, and
propellers as well. They putter
around like little kids in their nur
sery. They arc presumptive in the
extreme. This plastering is one of
the more pestiferous examples of
that presumptiveness.
But the Convalescent Home Drive
is not the only sinner. There Was
once an unknown "midnight marau
der"' who stuck prohibition propa
ganda over campus automobiles.
That was particularly annoying; the
evil taste remaining in the mouth
after many bottles of beer. If it i
came to a showdown, I would rather
carry "Kiddie Blurb" than "Vol
stead Vagaries"—but both are par
ticularly obnoxious.
The Military Ball also bitten
by the same bug. They not only
splattered cards all over the cam
pus in general, with their great air
plane idea, but stuck up the wind
shields as well, si nothing sacred?
The facade of the Memorial Church
alone has escaped. But wait, there
is a Toyan Dance Saturday. I must
dash over and take a look at the
Memorial Church.
I love the Convalescent Home I
Kiddies—every one—bless their lit
tle hearts. Poor little unfortunates.
I wouldn't want to do anything that
would hurt them in the least. They
need money. The campus has money.
The Horn? gets it. That is very fine,
indeed. Some people use the Drive
to advance their political fortunes.
That is to be expected. Every char
ity movement has its share of
leeches.

But one thing happened during
