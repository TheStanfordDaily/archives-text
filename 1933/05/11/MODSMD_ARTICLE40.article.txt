THE OLD I)AKK HOUSE (Univer
sal) —At the Mcnlo Theatre.
Such films as "The Mystery of
1 the Wax Museum" and "King Kong"
1 are, half intentionally, half because
of iheir palpable absurdity, comic.
The comic and romantic interludes
I inserted in "The Old Dark House"
! i>re not good as such, tend, in fact, i
ito tear down the otherwise well
built melodramatic basis.
But as a horror film—and it
I should be kept in mind that, after
j all, the three are supposed primarily
I to be shockers—this British-Ameri
! can film makes them seem thin gro
i tesqueries, emphasizes their taste
less elements.
i
It is the grain of reason in "The
; Old Dark House" which lends an
ail of reality to the film and holds
an audience in far more tense sus
pense. All but one of the charac-
I ters in this thriller are persons
rather than creatures. And even
; Morgan (Boris Karloff), the savage
serving man, remains physically
within the bounds of possibility,
i Their madness is apparent, but more
horrible because their bearing is :
calm.
Further, the introduction of these i
; characters is keen: one sees Mor- !

' gan, the most recognizably mad, at
first, and Saul, in reality the most
awful, only for one short scene at
the last. This scene is played by
Roger Pendrel (Melvyn Douglas)
and the incendiary (Brember Wells)
witli a quiet intensity that, follow
ing the physically more strenuous
scenes, makes the film's climax ex
tremely high.
The players are fine: Wells, Eva
Moore, Ernest Thesiger, and John
Dudgeon being outstanding. Charles
Laughton, in a slight—but sane—
comic role, is disappointing. Melvyn
Douglas, after a series of inane
characterizations, gives a compe
tent, quiet performance. Arid in
demonstration of the pains to which
the producers have gone to get a
good cast, Raymond Massey is seen
in one of the necessarily colorless
roles which serve as mechanisms on
which the horror operates. Massey is
an actor of stellar proportions, was
the approved Hamlet of Bel-Geddes'
recent production which was other
wise roundly scored by the critics.
And these are some of the rea
sons why "The Old Dark House"
will prove anything but an anti
climax in the current cycle of thril
lers.
