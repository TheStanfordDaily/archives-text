GOOD OLD ASSEMBLY!
(A sad drama in three painful parts)
A Gentleman Rough of the hardier
type
Once fell for a campus production—
and so,
Believing himself to lie ready and
ripe
For instruction and culture—de
cided to go.
He purchased a ticket when lights
became dim,
Then struggled and fought in the
balcony chatter.
He sat in a scat that was NOT made
for him—
Or anyone normally built for that i
matter.
He sat in this cramped and uncom
fortable state
Through scene upon scene upon
scene. Inasmuch as
The extra-long play kept the audi- t
ence late—
Our stoical hero was brought home
on crutches.

CHARLEROI, P;i.—Annoyed by
complaints, Constable Joseph An
drews announced a "cleanup" of
moonlight spooning parties on coun
try lanes in his bailiwick.
He .set out in his automobile and
passed summons to (en couples. No
body showed lip in court. Then he
happened to look ;i( his automobile,
Across the buck, undiscovered, was
pointed a neat sign:
"Never mind summons: Wnly :i
joke,"
