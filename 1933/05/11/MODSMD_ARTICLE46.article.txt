# Soccer Teams Improve As Class Games Loom
## 
### 
Adding fight and interest to the
already scrappy soccer scrimmages,
the interclass games to be held next
week are spurring the teams to big
ger things.
In the forward line Gaston Rojas
and Miguel Gomez played note
worthy games at their respective
inside positions and added still more
puzzlement to the problem of se
lecting a forward line. In the choos
ing; of this forward wall the factor
of co-operation is going to have to
be the big point. There are eleven
outstanding skilled players to fill
the mere five berths.
Fullbacks Rod Lewis, Dick
Strouse, and Henry Valentine will
all play in the interclass.
