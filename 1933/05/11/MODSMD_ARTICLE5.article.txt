# One-Act Plays To Be Given By French Group
## Little Theatre Curtain Rises At 8: 15 Tomorrow 
### 
For the first time in several years,
French plays will be acted in French
on the campus, when the class in
French conversation and dramatics
presents two one-act. comedies to
morrow evening. Barring the read
ing of Moliere's "Le Medicin Malgre
Lui" last winter, these productions
offer the first opportunity in some
time to see French drama in its
original state.
The plays are both comedies; the
first, Tristan Bernard's "Le Peintre
Ezigeant," concerns the wild ad
ventures of an artist in a bourgeois
family which desires to be immor
talized in something more than olive
oil.
The second play, Max Maurey's
farce, "Rosalie," deals with an of
fended serving-girl who, in a mo
ment. of tension, wins several con
cessions from an agitated employer.
The play is built much in the man
net of the modern blackout, rising
to a final gag line.
Casts have been rehearsing for
several weeks and finished produc
tions are to be expected. The pro
gram will be presented in the Lijtle
Theatre; curtain time has been set
for 8:15 o'clock. There will be an
admission charge of 10 cents.
