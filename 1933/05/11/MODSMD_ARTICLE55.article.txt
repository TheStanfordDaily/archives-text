### Oliver Johnston, Jr 
With nearly every day of spring
football bringing forth some new
stars, it is getting to be more and
more of a problem for Tiny to piece
together a representative first string.
In last night's scrimmage, Bob
Steiner and Buck Buchanan, play
ing at right and left ends, respec
tively, broke through to smear up
n majority of the plays run against
them.
Woody Adams and Larry Rouble
were very obvious at the guard po
sitions, opening up wide holes for
, the backs. All of which made Oct
Morgan look very well. Given a lit
tle hole Morgan can bore his way
through for good yardage.
Johnny Reisner can make even a
scrimmage exciting. With hi.s speed
j and ability to squirm out of the
hands of a raft of would-be tacklers,
he was by far the biggest ground
gainer of the session.
Bones Hamilton and Ray Todd
wc re not far behind him in the mat
ter of yardage. Besides being re
, sponsible, through hi.s blocking, for
a large portion of the gains, Bones
pioved that he can carry the pigskin,
too.
The only injuries were dealt out
to Bones Hamilton, who received a
hard crack on the head, and Bob
Reynolds with a badly bruised knee.
