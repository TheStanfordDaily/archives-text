### 
Touching on the feasibility of
television in modern communica
tive systems, Professor Frederick E.
Terman, of the Electrical Engineer
ing department, last night spoke
before the Research Club on the
"Possibilities and Limitations of In
telligent Transmission by Radio."
Sharing program honors with him
was Professor Edward Maslin
Hulme, of the history department,
who spoke on the "Personal Equa
tion of History."
While discussing frequency bands
necessary for different types of
communication, Professor Terman
said of all systems, television took
the widest band. A band between
550 and 1600 kilocycles wide could
carry about three and one-half mil
lion letters in code but only produce
a fair television picture of less than
5 by 6¼ inches.
