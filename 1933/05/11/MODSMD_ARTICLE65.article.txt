# Workouts End Friday On U.C. Football Field
## 
### 
Brief, intensive spring football
J practice has been going on for the
; past few days at the University of
! California and will continue until
i Ihe end of the week, thua winding i
I up the somewhat desultory prepara- i
lions for the Golden Bear 1933 cam-
I Pi'ign.
Due to the fact that many foot
hall men competed in spring i
sports and were not available for
the early, more leisurely work,
Coach W. A. "Bill" Ingram called
the brief session for the purpose
of getting together most of the
men who will man the varsity
squad next fall. .
Outstanding among the men asked !
to report is Captain John Ransome
who, with Captain Dick Tozer of last
I year's team, formed one of the
| greatest tackle combinations in the
country. Gigantic Dave Meek this!
year will also be on hand for end 1
duty.
Carlson, guard regular of the ,
32 aggregation, has been in a suit ;
as well as Christie, who was re
garded as one of the greatest ,
(inters on the Coast last season.
The quarterback position is well j
fortified with Joe Verducci and,
Chuck Stewart both available for
| duty. Arleigh Willis is back for ac- j
tion along with Shamlin, Relies, and ;
Bertoli. Floyd Blower, captain of the j
Bear frosh last season, is also mak- '
ing a bid for fame at one of the j
halfback posts.
Keefer and Quisling, a couple of j
nigged boys, are again ready for I
halfback work.
