# Spanish Journalist Says U.S. Colleges Are Nurses
## 
### FRANCES AYRES 
j "American colleges are mothers
I who have to nurse and protect stu
| dents like children .... but the
children never forget their Alma
| Mater."
II was Casimiro Alvarez speaking
j â€”scholar, man of the world, but.
| primarily a journalist. Educated at
i the University of Madrid, he is now
I
doing graduate work at Stanford,
while continuing his column in "La
Piensa," New York Spanish daily
newspaper.
His interest in literature will be
manifested tonight when he speaks
on "Una Hora des Rimas" at a

| meeting of Sigma Delta Pi, Spanish
honor society, at 8:10 o'clock in the ;
Women's Clubhouse.
Alvarez praises the understanding J
I and friendship that exists between j
American students and their col- !
leges.
"In Spain," he said, "culture alone
is emphasized. It takes nine years j
after one has received his A.B. to
obtain a degree in engineering. But j
no feeling of alumni loyalty exists." (
The Spanish journalist considers
American newspapers more ethical
than those in Europe. "Newspapers !
abroad and in South America sel- I
dom have an independent policy.
They have no idea of the value of j
advertising, and rely on political ;
support to finance their paper."
