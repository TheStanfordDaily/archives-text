# MORE WOMEN WILL ENTER AS RULING SPELLS END OF "500"
## New Theatre Plans Will Be Completed Within Two Weeks Official University Architects Ordered to Draw Up Blue-Prints and Cost Estimates; Tentative Plans Favor Second Quadrangle Style 
### STAN BEAUBAIRE 
QIT ICIAL University plans for a combination Memorial Group, which
is to include a modern theatre, revised to meet current developments
in prices and materials, are to be ready in approximately two weeks.
The Stanford Board of Trustees, it was learned from President Hay
Lyman Wilbur yesterday, has ordered the official University orchitccls to
draw up complete blue-prints and cost estimates of the group. This action
was taken four weeks ago.
Adhering to the principle to the proposed basis for a second quadrangle
as published in these columns Wednesday, the plans in detail for the
theatre itsilf are being laid out in various sets for different sizes and

pi ice levels. The seating capacities •
of the structures would vary from
1200 to 2300 ,it was revealed.
The idea as conceived to date was
explained in greater detail by Comp
troller Almon E. Roth, who is him
self also greatly interested, with Dr.
Wilbur, in bringing new structures
to the campus.
Court Planned
Presenting an imposing memorial
tower to the front, the group is to
center on a memorial court directly
to the rear of this entrance. The
present conception of this court is ,
very similar to that of the Pan- '
American building in Washington,
and is in effect like the Memorial
Court in the main quadrangle today.
To the right of this court, viewed
from the roadway which leads
from the English corner to Encina
Mall, would be the new Stanford
Theatre.
This building itself would not be
the special memorial structure, but
principally a theatre. Memorial fea- 1
tures would be chiefly embodied in 1
the tower and court. Then, to the 1
right of the theatre itself, one would 1
find the present Art Gallery facing ;
Lssuen.
To the left of the court, also
viewed from the front, there is to 1
be another building of a memorial '
nature. Exactly what its function is
to be has not as yet been deter
mined. The entire group, with the
main Library where it is today,
would then be ready to serve as a 1
base for a gigantic second quad
rangle at some future date when
sufficient funds are realized.
$151,000 in Fund
Tn the event that these plans are |
realized, money from the War Me
morial Fund which today totals :
over $151,000. will be utilized for
the group as a whole. Roth pointed
cut the fact that the obligation to (
erect a memorial demands that the
group be erected as a unit, and that
the theatre be secondary to the main
feature, which is memorial.
A complex picture is now pre- ■
sented to Stanford men and women,
one that could and should have been '
drawn long ago. Today one finds the
Stanford Board of Trustees, the (
Stanford Administration, Stanford
alumn, friends, and students all '
pulling for the same goal—a goal
that is to be realized in a new thea- 1
tre before many moons have passed.

Tn the event that these plans are |
realized, money from the War Me
morial Fund which today totals :
over $151,000. will be utilized for
the group as a whole. Roth pointed
cut the fact that the obligation to (
erect a memorial demands that the
group be erected as a unit, and that
the theatre be secondary to the main
feature, which is memorial.
A complex picture is now pre- ■
sented to Stanford men and women,
one that could and should have been '
drawn long ago. Today one finds the
Stanford Board of Trustees, the (
Stanford Administration, Stanford
alumn, friends, and students all '
pulling for the same goal—a goal
that is to be realized in a new thea- 1
tre before many moons have passed.
QIT ICIAL University plans for a combination Memorial Group, which
is to include a modern theatre, revised to meet current developments
in prices and materials, are to be ready in approximately two weeks.
The Stanford Board of Trustees, it was learned from President Hay
Lyman Wilbur yesterday, has ordered the official University orchitccls to
draw up complete blue-prints and cost estimates of the group. This action
was taken four weeks ago.
Adhering to the principle to the proposed basis for a second quadrangle
as published in these columns Wednesday, the plans in detail for the
theatre itsilf are being laid out in various sets for different sizes and

pi ice levels. The seating capacities •
of the structures would vary from
1200 to 2300 ,it was revealed.
The idea as conceived to date was
explained in greater detail by Comp
troller Almon E. Roth, who is him
self also greatly interested, with Dr.
Wilbur, in bringing new structures
to the campus.
Court Planned
Presenting an imposing memorial
tower to the front, the group is to
center on a memorial court directly
to the rear of this entrance. The
present conception of this court is ,
very similar to that of the Pan- '
American building in Washington,
and is in effect like the Memorial
Court in the main quadrangle today.
To the right of this court, viewed
from the roadway which leads
from the English corner to Encina
Mall, would be the new Stanford
Theatre.
This building itself would not be
the special memorial structure, but
principally a theatre. Memorial fea- 1
tures would be chiefly embodied in 1
the tower and court. Then, to the 1
right of the theatre itself, one would 1
find the present Art Gallery facing ;
Lssuen.
To the left of the court, also
viewed from the front, there is to 1
be another building of a memorial '
nature. Exactly what its function is
to be has not as yet been deter
mined. The entire group, with the
main Library where it is today,
would then be ready to serve as a 1
base for a gigantic second quad
rangle at some future date when
sufficient funds are realized.
$151,000 in Fund
Tn the event that these plans are |
realized, money from the War Me
morial Fund which today totals :
over $151,000. will be utilized for
