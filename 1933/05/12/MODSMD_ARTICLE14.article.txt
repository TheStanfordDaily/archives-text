## 
### MARY JACOBSTEIN 
' I think wo are very fortunate,"
said Jeanne Millard last night, "in
that Stanford lias a situation such
as the "500'' present which can be
turned into a means of combatting
the current depression." The future
A.W.S. head, contacted at a late
hour, spoke in reference to the
sudden move of the Board of Trus
tees which will set up the new ratio
of women to men on the campus.
Adding that .she considered it to
be a "good permanent move," Mil
lard declared that the plan will ul
timately tend to raise the scholastic
average of the men enrolled in the
University, in that women with high
grade marks formerly refused ad
mittance now be considered in place
of men who are slightly lower.
Emily Ross, president of Roble,

was not sure what to think, although
she admitted the new regulation
makes the situation more normal.
She understands the University will
solve the problem of housing, and
feels the only thing to do is "sit
and wait." When asked what the
gills in Roble generally thought, she
retorted, "Did you hear them in
the dining room this evening?"
"It's a good idea, and much more
sensible and natural," conceded
Therina Gucrard, Y.W.C.A. presi
dent, "but at the risk of sounding
exclusive, I'm glad I was here when
there were only 500. It's a grand
tradition."
Marion Parker, next year's vice
president of W.A.A., also is in favor
of the plan, and thinks it a good
thine for the University.
