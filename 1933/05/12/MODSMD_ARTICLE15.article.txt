### 
As track-minded sports enthusi-
I asts trek to Fresno tomorrow for the
annual cinder relays, California
| aquatic fans have a similar treat in
j store for them at Encina pools,
where 178 swimmers, representing
' 18 teams, meet in the second annual
Stanford Swimming Relays.
i Races will be divided into Class
A, B, and C events. Class A will be
open to any team, Class B to college
freshman and Junior College.' swim
mers, and Class C to high-school
! teams. There will also be two fea
| tured open races, the 440-yard
breaststroke attack on the National
A.A.U. short-course record of 6:16.6,
| and the 50-yard backstroke race in
| the same pool.
Stanford is conceded to have
only a fighting chance to maintain
its supremacy in'the Class A divi
sion, since the announcement of
the entrance of the San Francisco
Y.M.C.A. mermen, who are heav
ily favored to clean up in the
backstroke and breaststroke re
lays. However, these events, as
well as the freestyle and medley
relays, should he close battles be
tween the "Y" swimmers, the
Athens Club, and the Indians.
Led by Ted Wiget, who won the
100-yard race at the Y.M.C.A. pool
Wednesday night, the Indians should
! be able to cop the 400-yard freestyle

race, but it is very doubtful if they
can repeat in the 200-yard event.
Two close battles are expected in
the Class B events in which Long
Beach Junior College swimmers will
be favored over the Stanford fresh
men and Santa Maria Junior College.

High School yesterday, Class C com

in the 440-yard special race because
