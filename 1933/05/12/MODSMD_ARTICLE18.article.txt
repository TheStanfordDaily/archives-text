# Drastic Move Is Taken To Bolster Fiscal Condition
## Statement by Mrs. Stanford Interpreted to Mean That Founding Grant Provision May Be Set Aside In Furthering University Welfare 
### 
TING under the stress of strained economic conditions, the Board of
Trustees yesterday afternoon shook the campus with a bombshell re
port that swept aside Stanford's famed "500." 0
Basing the validity of their revolutionary action on a statement made
by Mrs. Stanford in 1903, just before her death, the trustees announced
that beginning autumn quarter women would be admitted on a ratio
roughly estimated to be 55 men to 45 women.
This proportion corresponds to that prevalent at the time Mrs. Stanford
issued her oificial edict in May of 1899 limiting the women to 500.
In 1899 Mrs. Stanford noted a steady increase of women attending uni
versities throughout the state. To bait this movement at Stanford, founded
as a memoriam to her son, though with men and women placed on an

>equal standing, the limiting restric
tion was read into the Founders'
Grant.
The Trustees pointed out that the
action taken was not in conflict with
Mrs. Stanford's broader aims. Presi
dent Kay Lyman Wilbur yesterday
read the statement from Mrs. Stan
ford issued in 1903 that said:
"It is the paramount purpose of
the founders of Stanford Univer
sity to promote the public wel
fare by founding, endowing, and
having maintained a university of
high degree with colleges and all
other things necessary and appro
piatc to a university of high de
gree, and all directions and other
reservations in the Founding
Grant and all amendments by the
founders or by the survivor of
them are incidental and subordi
nate to that paramount purpose."
After quoting the above statement
Dr. Wilbur said:
"It seems clear that under the
stringency which the University is
facing, the paramount purpose of
the founders to 'maintain the Uni
versity at a high degree' can best
be- served by considering the limita
tions imposed by Mrs. Stanford as
'incidental and subordinate.'"
Living Quarters
He also said that Stanford had the
plant, the facilities, and faculty to
handle the increased enrollment of
women. Possibility of housing facili
ties seemed somewhat doubtfui on
the campus; yesterday, however.
Dean Mary Yost said she had
heard nothing of the increase until
late yesterday afternoon. No plans
for housing had been discussed, she
said. These and similar details would
be threshed out Monday when Pres
ident Wilbur returns from San
Francisco.
Under the new system, Dean Yost
explained, women will be admitted
under the same acceptance regula
tions that govern men. In the past as
many as 4 or 5 women have applied
for every vacancy in the quota.
This created a rigid competitive sys
ttry.
The complete resolution adopted
by the trustees yesterday follows:

"Therefore be it resolved that the
University authorities increase the
number-of women students beyond
500, but maintaining substantially
the same proportion between men
and women (55 men to 45 women)
as existed when the direction oi'
May 31, 1899, was made by Mrs.
Stanford."

He also said that Stanford had the
plant, the facilities, and faculty to
handle the increased enrollment of
women. Possibility of housing facili
ties seemed somewhat doubtfui on
the campus; yesterday, however.
Dean Mary Yost said she had
heard nothing of the increase until
late yesterday afternoon. No plans
for housing had been discussed, she
said. These and similar details would
be threshed out Monday when Pres
ident Wilbur returns from San
Francisco.
Under the new system, Dean Yost
explained, women will be admitted
under the same acceptance regula
tions that govern men. In the past as
many as 4 or 5 women have applied
for every vacancy in the quota.
This created a rigid competitive sys
ttry.
The complete resolution adopted
by the trustees yesterday follows:

"Therefore be it resolved that the
University authorities increase the
number-of women students beyond
500, but maintaining substantially
the same proportion between men
and women (55 men to 45 women)
as existed when the direction oi'
May 31, 1899, was made by Mrs.
Stanford."
TING under the stress of strained economic conditions, the Board of
Trustees yesterday afternoon shook the campus with a bombshell re
port that swept aside Stanford's famed "500." 0
Basing the validity of their revolutionary action on a statement made
by Mrs. Stanford in 1903, just before her death, the trustees announced
that beginning autumn quarter women would be admitted on a ratio
roughly estimated to be 55 men to 45 women.
This proportion corresponds to that prevalent at the time Mrs. Stanford
issued her oificial edict in May of 1899 limiting the women to 500.
In 1899 Mrs. Stanford noted a steady increase of women attending uni
versities throughout the state. To bait this movement at Stanford, founded
as a memoriam to her son, though with men and women placed on an

>equal standing, the limiting restric
tion was read into the Founders'
Grant.
The Trustees pointed out that the
action taken was not in conflict with
Mrs. Stanford's broader aims. Presi
dent Kay Lyman Wilbur yesterday
read the statement from Mrs. Stan
ford issued in 1903 that said:
"It is the paramount purpose of
the founders of Stanford Univer
sity to promote the public wel
fare by founding, endowing, and
having maintained a university of
high degree with colleges and all
other things necessary and appro
piatc to a university of high de
gree, and all directions and other
reservations in the Founding
Grant and all amendments by the
founders or by the survivor of
them are incidental and subordi
nate to that paramount purpose."
After quoting the above statement
Dr. Wilbur said:
"It seems clear that under the
stringency which the University is
facing, the paramount purpose of
the founders to 'maintain the Uni
versity at a high degree' can best
be- served by considering the limita
tions imposed by Mrs. Stanford as
'incidental and subordinate.'"
