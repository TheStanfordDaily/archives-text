# '33 Accepts Scholarship Pledge Plan
## Graduates Vote to Endow Student Fund 
### 
Hoping to stir up enthusiasm in
the campaign for endowment pledg
es. the Class of '33 decided in last
night's meeting to present all funds
so pledged to a general scholarship
fund, to be administered by the
Stanford Scholarship Committee.
In so deciding, seniors made a
definite break with custom, since
former classes have almost with
out exception given their personal
endowment pledges into the Uni
versity treasury, to be used ac
cording to current needs.
"It is expected," states Wayne
Bannister, who heads the Endow
ment Committee, "that this plan of
devoting the pledged money of the
'33 alumni to aiding deserving Stan
ford students will result in increased
co-operation in the campaign."
Discussion of Senior Week, fea
turing a talk by Professor Hardin
Craig, chairman of the Public Exer
cises Committee, on Senior Week
traditions and this year's arrange
ments, filled out the program of the
senior meeting.
Reports Given
Committee heads reviewed the
work of their groups, reports being
given on Commemoration, Senior
Prom, Senior Ball, and Class Plate.
It was urged that Senior Class dues,
$1 be paid either at the A.S.S.U.
office or to living-group representa
tives immediately.
Today is the final opportunity to
procure senior booklets and an
nouncements, according to Gene
Mires, committee' chairman. They
may be ordered at the Alumni or
A.S.S.U. offices until 5 o'clock this
afternoon.
