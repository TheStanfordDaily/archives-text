# Five Hundred Is No More A Depression-Born Blessing
## 
### 
Stanford's sclecl and exclusive Five Hundred is no
more. Through ;i liberal, ye I literal, reading ol' Mrs. Stan
lord's amendments lo the founding grant yesterday after
noon, I lie lioard of Trustees yesterday set aside the tradi
tional restriction on llic number of women students in
the I Diversity. News that llie bars were down spread rap
i<||y about the campus yesterday afternoon and evening,
and llic majority student opinion appeared lo be unfavor
able. In spile of thai student opinion, the Daily stands
squarely behind llie trustees in their drastic action, be
lieving il lo be llie most progressive and beneficial change
(<f policy in llie I nivcrsily's rcccnl hislory.
Objections to llie trustees' action are being made prin
cipally bv persons who fail lo understand the reasons
which eHeeled the change, and who fail lo recognize the
authority which gave the Hoard rein to abolish the Five
Hundred. In the original founding grant of the I'niversity,
contrary lo popular belief, Senator and Mrs. Stanford pro
vided for etpial opportunities and educational facilities for
both sexes. In 18!)!) Mrs. Stanford, the surviving founder,
not wishing Ihc I'niversity founded in memory of her son
to ever become a dominantly female institution, provided
that the number of women should not exceed live hundred,
a number which approximated the ratio between men and
women students which she thought suitable in the Stan
ford of thai day.
In I!M).'5, however, among the hist amendments lo the
founding grant which Mrs. Stanford wrote, came her pro
vision thai the paramount purpose of the I'niversity was
lo maintain an institution of high degree, and that "all
directions or reservations in the Founding Grant and all
amendments or attempted amendments thereof by the
Founders, or by llie Survivor of them, are incidental and
subordinate to that paramount purpose."
And il was that authority to overrule the Founding
Grant and its amendments which the Hoard of Trustees
exercised yesterday, t'nder Ihc economic stringency which
Stanford faces today, the trustees wisely deemed it desir
able to maintain Ihc excellence of the I'niversity through
lifting the restrictions upon women students rather than
by in any way lowering the standards required for the
matriculation of men students.
The greater share oil-objections lo the abolition of the
Five Hundred seem lo emanate from the Five Hundred
itself. Whether those objections spring instinctively from
feminine vanity or from a misunderstanding of the true
situation il is difficult to say. The Daily prefers to believe
thai Stanford women object because Ihev have erroneously
jumped to the conclusion that the requirements for wo
men's admission lo the I niversilv will be lowered under
the new scheme of things.
The presence of increasing numbers of women on the
Farm will be a decided benclit from a strictly social stand
point. The Five Hundred limit has resulted in an abnormal
and highly artificial social situation at Stanford. For years
that fact has been recognized. Kven the women students
themselves have periodically expressed the desire for an
increase in the registration limit. Within Ihc memory of
the present undergraduate generation, Svlva Weaver, wo
men's edilor of llie Duly, voiced an appeal for somebody
with ten million dollars lo found a women's college of
three thousand students at Stanford. And that appeal met
with the enthusiastic approbation of the Five Hundred.
For years people on the Farm have been Irving to figure
cut ways and means by which a separate women's college
might be endowed and operated coincidenlally by llie Stan
lord Hoard of Trustees. And now the desired end has been
achieved, in a different way, overnight. The suddenness
of the trustees' action in abolishing the hive Hundred has
met with some momentary disapproval, but il is Irulv i
depression-born blessing.

that fact has been recognized. Kven the women students
themselves have periodically expressed the desire for an
increase in the registration limit. Within Ihc memory of
the present undergraduate generation, Svlva Weaver, wo
men's edilor of llie Duly, voiced an appeal for somebody
with ten million dollars lo found a women's college of
three thousand students at Stanford. And that appeal met
with the enthusiastic approbation of the Five Hundred.
For years people on the Farm have been Irving to figure
cut ways and means by which a separate women's college
might be endowed and operated coincidenlally by llie Stan

achieved, in a different way, overnight. The suddenness

Stanford's sclecl and exclusive Five Hundred is no

the I Diversity. News that llie bars were down spread rap

Objections to llie trustees' action are being made prin

contrary lo popular belief, Senator and Mrs. Stanford pro
vided for etpial opportunities and educational facilities for
both sexes. In 18!)!) Mrs. Stanford, the surviving founder,
not wishing Ihc I'niversity founded in memory of her son
to ever become a dominantly female institution, provided
that the number of women should not exceed live hundred,
a number which approximated the ratio between men and
women students which she thought suitable in the Stan
ford of thai day.
In I!M).'5, however, among the hist amendments lo the
founding grant which Mrs. Stanford wrote, came her pro
vision thai the paramount purpose of the I'niversity was
lo maintain an institution of high degree, and that "all
directions or reservations in the Founding Grant and all
amendments or attempted amendments thereof by the
Founders, or by llie Survivor of them, are incidental and
subordinate to that paramount purpose."
And il was that authority to overrule the Founding
Grant and its amendments which the Hoard of Trustees
exercised yesterday, t'nder Ihc economic stringency which
Stanford faces today, the trustees wisely deemed it desir
able to maintain Ihc excellence of the I'niversity through
lifting the restrictions upon women students rather than
by in any way lowering the standards required for the
matriculation of men students.
The greater share oil-objections lo the abolition of the
Five Hundred seem lo emanate from the Five Hundred
itself. Whether those objections spring instinctively from
feminine vanity or from a misunderstanding of the true
situation il is difficult to say. The Daily prefers to believe
thai Stanford women object because Ihev have erroneously
jumped to the conclusion that the requirements for wo
