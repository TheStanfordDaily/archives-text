# Off the Proper Course, But Full Steam Ahead Still the Order

### 
The educational system of the tailed States has been!
liil harder l>v the depression than almost any other insti
tution. Not only are most universities suffering from a
lack of funds, but the p;isl two years have served to show
in a clearer light just how far off the proper course they
have been driven during the past decade.
Out of American universities graduate every year thou
sands of bachelors of arts and sciences who neither know
nor care what arts and sciences are. Their solitary aim has
been the rapid acquisition, of money, and for years thev!
managed to do fairly well in a world shot full of the dope
of a false prosperity.
I he lault lies partly, ot course, with the student and
partly with a false conception of democracy. The latter is
based on a premise of mass education which is impracti-'
cable and wrong. The universities, 100, have a large <le-■
gree of responsibility. \
Perhaps, out of the depression, which has helped 10
clearly expose this situation, there will come a tightening
of the educational system, a return to lirst principles, and
« discarding of false ideals.
