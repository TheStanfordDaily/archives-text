As America's Cadillac Cowboy
Will Rogers puis it, "All I don't
know will never be printed in the
papers." It does seem that there is
a move on foot to build Stanford a
new Theatre. Whether or not this
can be done with the Memorial
Fund, I don't know. The chances are
thi.' ; money is invested in 1929 stocks
and bonds—and that speaks for itself
as to its present availability. That
Stanford should have a new As
sembly Hall is uncomfortably evi
dent—at least to anyone who has sat
in that barn next to the Administra
tion Building.
When Stanford is buried beneath
the sands of time, and in due course
is discovered by archaeologists, their
puzzled reactions will be very in
teresting. I hope that I am there to
sec them. After they find a Rosetta
Stone and translate "University" to
mean "University," they will begin
to study this educational plant. First,
they will discover a huge gathering
place—larger than anything else;
very expensive and very complete.
That will be the Football Stadium.

Another structure—among the less
antique—will be uncovered, the En
ema Gym. The Basketball Pavilion
will stagger (hem for awhile until
they find out about basketball. Then
a most lavish and semi-collosal edi
fice will be unearthed. The Presi
dent's Office will be the first guess—
assuming those archaeologists lo be
as simply logical as present ones.
Digging further, they might think
it to be a meeting-place for profes
sors and their ever-eager students.
Then, finally, they will learn that
it is the Women's Gymnasium. Their
amazement will be catastrophic.

Learning as they will that R.O.T.C.
was given at Stanford, they will
immediately deduce that what we
call the Assembly Hall was the
stables—a bit drafty, perhaps—but
being superior and condescending
in 2933, t"hey will be sure that the
barbarians of 1933 were cruel to
dumb animals. Imagine my embar
rassment as I overhear their com
ments—overhear them as I hide be
neath a pile of uncovered documents
or gravel. Imagine my dread that
they will uncover me and make me
explain that what they thought was
an inadequate stable was the As
sembly Hall.
Dramatics is accused of deficits—
but one of the reasons is that un
comfortable Hall; the play not only
has to overcome campus apathy but
what is more fundamental—rump re
sistance. How much money would
football make if it were staged in
that lot behind Branner? Even a
Democratic ward-healer could hire
a better hall than that offered Presi
dent Wilbur when he returned from
Washington.

This is a University—an educa
tional establishment with the Board
of Athletic Control in better estab
lishments than the Administration.
This is an institution of higher
learning with hundreds of thousands
fci gyms and not one penny for
anything else. It is an anomaly—
like a one-armed paperhanger will)
broken suspenders.
With building costs low, with in
flation a blazing light in the future,
now is the time for a new Stanford
Theatre—if we can get the money.
The wood-pile Ethiopian reveals
himself in the last paragraph.
