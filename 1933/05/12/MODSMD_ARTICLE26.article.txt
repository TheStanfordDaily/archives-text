ALICE IN WONDERLAND (Carroll)
—At the Stanford Theatre this
afternoon only.
Direct from a successful San Fran
| cisco run comes this Reginald
Travers production of Lewis Car-
I
j roll's bibles of nonsense, Alice in
; Wonderland" and "Through the
! Looking-Glass."
The play is given a colorful and
I effective presentation, with a num
| ber of features to commend it. Not
j the least of these are the costumes
I and masks; done after the illustra-
I
I tions by Sir John Tenniel, they are
1 in perfect character and enhance the
' performance immensely. Alberta
i Martin has done an admirable piece
| of work in this respect.
j The settings, too, are in the spirit
of the story and most effective.
The fault of the production seems
I to lie mainly with the adaptation,
which in attempting to give unity
| and co-ordination to an exception-
I ally disconnected narrative, has
! sacrificed some of the continuity of

the original. This, however, will be
noticed only by the most enthusi
astic "Alice" lovers, and all will
agree that the well -loved book of
the Oxford mathematician has been
given a splendid mounting.
The members of the cast, too nu
merous to mention here, are uni
formly excellent, with many of them
doing i - eally outstanding work. No
table is Peggy Bothers' Red Queen,
which is wholly delightful and per
fcclly in character. Emma Knox
handles splendidly the difficult role
of Alice, and the Queen of Hearts
(Edwin Max), the White Rabbit

(Kathleen Sherman), and the Mad
Hatter (Peter Hester) are excep
tionally well impersonated.
