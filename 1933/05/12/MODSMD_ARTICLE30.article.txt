It was born when Nort Thornton
happened to glance at a paper and
noticed that a world's record was
broken at the Minnesota Relays.
Nort knew little about the Minne
sota Swimming Relays, but he
straightway gave birth to an idea.
It was a swell idea, and shortly after
it.- immaculate conception (for the
thought wa.s Nort's alone), the idea
was born.
It was a lusty, healthy young
'un, and, in spite of the depres
sion and its youth, it began earn
ing money in its first year. It
earned over 200 dollars as a year
ling. and it philunthropically gave
pleasure to many persons as well.
Now it is two years old, and it has
attracted the attentions of the en
tire Coast. In fact, it is an infant
pi odigy, and they come from far
and near- from Long Beach and
Tamalpais to see it. And ifs earn
ings have increased.
Philanthropical still, with money
a: v/ilh enjoyment, it plans on do
nating its 1933 earnings to the Stan
ford Board of Athletic Control, even
as it donated its 1932 earnings to
the United States Olympic Fund.
And it plans on demonstrating to
morrow afternoon its remarkable
growth in natatorial excellence us
well as in earning capacity.
I speak, of course, of the second
annual Stanford Swimming Relays.
