# SPORTS SMATTERINGS FROM THIS FARM
## 
### 
Someone named Mohler watched
Monday's football practice .... It
is rumored that lit* once attended
U S.C Stan Anderson, Frank
Alu.stiza, and Buck Van Dellen have
been punting them 50 yards and
better with consistency .... An
derson will long be remembered for
that Big Game kick last year; Alus
ti/.;< was the punting fool of the
fmsh; but Van Dellen is new in the
booting role The latter came
to Stanford as a pole-vaulter and
will leave as a gridder.
And Johnny Moltram arrived
as a quarler-miler and is now the
best javelin-thrower on the Coast.
.... He was also frosh football
captain And bis step in the
javelin is similar to cross-step
once advocated for shot-putters
by Dink Tcmpleton.
Monk Moscrip and Bobby Gray
son won their numerals in football,
baseball, and track Dave
Packard won numerals in football,
basketball, and track as a frosh and
was captain of the two latter teams.
. . . ,A1 Snyder, Stanford fencing
captain-elect, was invited to com
pote at the Chicago World's Fair.
. . . . More details later, when I
get 'em!
Soccer workouts have found Cap
l.'in Carl Knecht unable to practice
because of doctor's orders
Bt inie Kaufman, plump and jovial,
has been guarding the goal in a
manner to bring fear to the palpi -
ti'.ting hearts of Jack King and Milt
Newman, the 1932 co-regulars . . . .
King is an all-Conference goalie
and Newman is about on a par . . . .
Harry Maloney was suggesting to
Cy Johnson, Gas Rojas, Sven Dod
ington, et al., that the first team
could use a bit more scoring punch
without catastrophic results, and a
regular fullback, tired of being out
played by the scrubs, hollered,
"Well, the second team can score
al! right!"
Yeliudi Menuhin, who bears a
very slight physical resemblance to
the above-mentioned Mr. KaufmaTT,
was singularly honored when four
of the roughest Stanford roughs who
feast around the Breakers' board
turned out for a meal of music
nther than mutton .... Names?
Certainly, Mr. Hemingway, Al Abra
hamsen, Buck Buchanan, Will Har
wood, and Spud Hanulton
The first two are football ends, the
third a track dashman, and the
fourth a soccer man-about-town.
At yesterday's Circle S Society
(Gordie Graves presiding), Burke
Knapp read off the names of the
r.c w members Included in the
list was a soccer stalwart who can
be called Jones for brevity's sake.
