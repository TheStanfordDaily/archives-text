# CARD POLOISTS BATTLE BLACK-FOXE TOMORROW
## 
### BY CHARLES CHAPPELL 
In what is expected to be one of
the hardest fought games of the
quarter, Stanford's redshirted polo
ists y, ill attempt to turn back a squad
of hi; hly touted cadets from the
Black-Foxe Military Institute of
Hollywood tomorrow on the High
way polo field. The game will begin
at 2:!50 o'clock, a half hour earlier
than usual.
Slightly changing the lineup he
has used so far this quarter, Cap
tain Dick Gordan will start Luppe
Luppen at number one, Pat Robb at
two, Captain Pete Gillham at three,
and Johnny Myers at back. If Myers,
who has been suffering from an in
juied back this week, is unable to
play, Woody Melone will be sent in
at number three and Gillham shifted
to back.
Cadet Players
Playing against what might be
called his former future teammates
will be Dick Mellon, flashy number
three man for the Cadets. Mellon
was registered at Stanford autumn
quarter but later transferred to
Black-Foxe.
The rest of the visiting lineup
will include John Barneson at num
ber one, Captain Bob Wallace at
two, and John Cykler at back. Three
other men and Coach George Pilâ€”
kington will also accompany the
team.
Strong Record
Besides a one-sided victory over
Loyola University that sets them up
as equal in strength to Stanford,
the Film City mallet-wielders have
also defeated the Hollywood Polo
and Hunt Club and the Los Indios
Club, two powerful Southern Cali

fcrnia quartets.
Stanford's successful record so
far this season, however, indicates
that the visitors will have to play
some mighty good polo if they
expect to go home with any In
dian scalps dangling at their belts.
Showing steady improvement this
quarter, the Indians played some of
tin best polo they have ever shown
in the semi-finals on the Pacific
Coast Low Goal Tournament at San
Mateo two weeks ago.
Admission to the game will be
25 cents.
