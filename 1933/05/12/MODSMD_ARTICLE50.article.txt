# Slow Motion Film Shows Hables In Win Over Ball
## 
### 
Substantiating Stanford's claims
that Les Hables nosed out Les Ball i
of U.S.C. in the 100-yard dash last
Saturday at the Olympic Stadium,
slew-motion pictures taken of the i
finish show the Indian as winner
but introduce an argument on the
decision in the high hurdles, in
which Gus Meier was awarded the
victory over Trojan Captain Jeddy
Welsh.
The film, taken by D. Scott Chis
holm, Los Angeles sports writer,
when run in reverse, shows the tape
piecing together over Hables' chest,
indicating him as the winner. Pre
viously no controversy had been
heard over the announced results
t)f the high hurdles.
Welsh, running behind Meier all
the way and not figured better than
Ihird or fourth before the race, came
up fast at the finish as the Indian
hurdler knocked over the last two
barriers and, according to the films,
broke the tape just ahead of him.
