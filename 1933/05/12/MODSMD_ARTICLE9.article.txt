# Graham Stuart Hits Weak Peace Moves

### 
''The failure of the world's public
opinion* to prevent the declaration
of war by Paraguay against Bolivia
and the aggressive action of Japan
in the Far East, both signatories of
the Peace Pact of Paris, would seem
to indicate that our peace machinery
shruld either be substantially
si l engthened or it might as well be
scrapped."
Professor Graham Stuart, who re
cently returned from the April
meeting in Washington of the Amer
ican Society of International Law,
voiced this opinion yesterday.
"Considering the fact that Presi
dent Roosevelt has already insisted
upon the absolute sanctity of inter
m tional treaties and requested per
mission to levy an embargo upon
arms," he continued, "it would ap
pear as though the United States
were getting ready to make more
effective the Kellogg-Briand Pact
and the Hoover-Stimson doctrine of
non-recognition of changes in the
status quo of nations."
