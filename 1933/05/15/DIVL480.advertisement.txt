WHAT?
Advertising?
Frederick C. Kendall, editor of
Advertising 8C Selling, says,
"Advertising is still young. Yii
it is already a vital part of every
important industry. The pro
fessional advertising man must
be :*.ot only a thoughtful student
of human nature, but also a stu
dent of all American business."
SPARKING" ideas are the life
blood of advertising. That's
why advertising men, as well as
college men, turn to a pipe. l ; °r a
good pipe with the right tobacco
is man's first-aid to clear thinking
end wisdom. As for the "right
tobacco" — that's Edgeworth
Smoking Tobacco."
Just one puff will tell you why.
it's that truly individual blend of
fine old hurleys—a blend you find
only in Edgeworth. Oncc you try
L : dgeworth, nothing less will do.
