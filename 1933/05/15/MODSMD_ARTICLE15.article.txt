# F.R. Shapes Work Drive
## Cabinet Waits Approval Of Proposed Sales Tax 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 14 (/P)
President Roosevelt today made
ready to top off his domestic emer
gency reconstruction drive this
week in a comprehensive proposal
to Congress for employment and
business stimulation through public
works and industrial management.
Cruising down the Potomac river
today, Mr. Roosevelt studied the
draft of his broad legislative piece.
Administrative advisers who last
night proposed to him a manu
facturers' tax of between I and
1 1 2 per cent to underwrite the
$!{,30(MH)0.000 public works pro
gram were inclined to believe he
would approve it.
Another conference among con
gressional leaders, representatives of
industry and labor and Government
heads is contemplated by the Presi
dent in a move to bring unity before
sending the measure to Congress
tomorrow or Tuesday.
Both Senate and House commit
tees plan a report this week on the
Roosevelt railroad reorganization
measure, and final action on this
before the end of the month appears
ct rtain.
Self-denial, is not the best means
ol character formation; it may work
more harm than good if overdone.
