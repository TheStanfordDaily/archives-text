"Stanford! Mais c'esl epatant!"
Your reporter gulped—with his two
word French vocabulary—but soon
one of the visiting French midship
men was found who could really
speak English, and found that most,
of (he hundred or more who visited
the campus Saturday afternoon were
quite pleased with their first sight
of a large American university.
"Your school-, arc <ijuitc different
from those we attend in France,"
explained Henri Aragnol, Enseignc
de Vaisseau, from the training
ship Jeanne d'Arc. "In our coun
try we attend a six-year high
school, of "lycce" after (lie "ccolc,"
or primary school. After gradu
ating from the "Jycec," we may
attend the universities, which cor
respond to your graduate schools.
At universities, students take their
work very seriously."'
A tour of the campus, showing
the visitors most of the points of
interest, ended at the Stadium,
where a high-school meet was in
progress. As he watched the hur
diers no down the track, Aragnol
commented, "In France, students
also show considerable interest in
athletics, although universities do
not sponsor athlclics. All contests
are held outside of schools. We are
partjcularlv interested in football,
rugby, soccer, and tennis."
The group returned later in the
afternoon to San Francisco, where
they will remain until Tuesday.
Then they will sail on the Jeanne
d'Arc for Lo> Augcles, then
through the Panama Canal to the
lies de Saint, and back to Brest,
from where the,\ started seven
months ago on their round-the
world cruise.
