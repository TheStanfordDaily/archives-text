# MEIER CRACKS ROSS NICHOLS' TIME IN HIGHS
## Card Two-Mile Relay Team Wins, But Disbarred By Technicality TROJANS TAKE HONORS Marty Shatters World Mark In High Jump 
### Albert Guerard, Jr 
Inspired by the startling world
I record high jump of Walter Marty,
j who was competing before u home
; town audience, athletes from gawky
high-school freshmen to veterans of
Olympic competition cracked fifteen
records at the Fresno Relays Sat
uiday night while U.S.C. trampled
Stanford's injury-ridden squad by
a 93-54 margin.
Only one record was shattered
in the University division. That
| one fell before the dynamic hur
dling of Indian Gus Meier, who
skimmed the high hurdles in 11.5
j seconds, shaving one-tenth of a
j second ofY the former record held
by Ross Nichols, also of Stanford.
The race was by two-tenths of a
; second the fastest of Meier's career,
and cemented his recent victories
over Bob Lyon and Jeddy Welsh of
U.S.C.
Sam Kastman Brilliant
Scarcely less valuable to the Stan
ford cause were the brilliant per
formances of Sam Eastman, running
the greatest 880 of his career, and
broad-jumper Phil Williams, who
leaped 24 feet .1% inches. Anchoring
Stanford's two-mile relay team,
Eastman (whose flaming red hair
shone like a bonfire in the arc lights)
started the final half-mile some
yards behind the much-vaunted
Ferris Webster of U.S.C., stuck with
the Trojan star for a lap and a hah',
then passed Webster on the back
stretch, resisted three smashing
challenges, and came down the home
| stretch a good winner.
Because Jim Ferric was not of
| ficially entered in the event, U.S.C.
won the official victory and (lie
I four gold watches. Incidentally,
I the brilliant running of Ferric in
: the medley relay did much to
i soften the pangs of a Trojan vic
tory in that event. The expected
Morcntin-Foore duel in this event
| did not materialize.

Mottram Wins
! Johnny Mottram's superiority
over U.S.C. javelin-throwers was
proved beyond any question. The
Stanford Adonis threw 205 fcrt, -V ; i
inches, eight feet better than tlv
tosses of Kenneth McKcn/.ie and
Fiank Williamson of Troy. Indian
J discus-throwers took first, second,
; and third, with Here Laborde's 15(5
feet, 9'/i> inches leading the pack.
Next to Marty's brilliant (i feet,
| X :, s inches in the record-breaking
line were Floyd Wilson's of Fresno
State's 21 feet, record in the
College broad jump, the 197-foot
javelin-throw by Kenneth Church
ill's younger brother, the 14-foot
, pole-vault by Hill Grabcr, and the
21 feet, 1' t broad-jump by Nor
man Paul, (he lad who just a week
previous had tied the world's rec
I ord for the 220-yard low hurdles.
Inspired by the startling world
I record high jump of Walter Marty,
j who was competing before u home

high-school freshmen to veterans of
Olympic competition cracked fifteen
records at the Fresno Relays Sat
uiday night while U.S.C. trampled
Stanford's injury-ridden squad by
a 93-54 margin.
Only one record was shattered
in the University division. That
| one fell before the dynamic hur
dling of Indian Gus Meier, who
skimmed the high hurdles in 11.5
j seconds, shaving one-tenth of a
j second ofY the former record held
by Ross Nichols, also of Stanford.
The race was by two-tenths of a
; second the fastest of Meier's career,
and cemented his recent victories
over Bob Lyon and Jeddy Welsh of
U.S.C.
Sam Kastman Brilliant
Scarcely less valuable to the Stan
ford cause were the brilliant per
formances of Sam Eastman, running
the greatest 880 of his career, and
broad-jumper Phil Williams, who
leaped 24 feet .1% inches. Anchoring
Stanford's two-mile relay team,
Eastman (whose flaming red hair
shone like a bonfire in the arc lights)
started the final half-mile some
yards behind the much-vaunted
Ferris Webster of U.S.C., stuck with
the Trojan star for a lap and a hah',
then passed Webster on the back
stretch, resisted three smashing
challenges, and came down the home
| stretch a good winner.
Because Jim Ferric was not of
| ficially entered in the event, U.S.C.
won the official victory and (lie
I four gold watches. Incidentally,
I the brilliant running of Ferric in

Morcntin-Foore duel in this event
