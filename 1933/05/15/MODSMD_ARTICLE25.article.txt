Kverywhcrc on Ihe campus yon bear themâ€”men of I lie
Class of bemoaning I lie passing of their college days,
men who ;i week ago were anticipating I lie day when tliov
would turn Ihcir hacks 011 I lie well-known Stanford gales.
"Il ll he great around here next year" The ahonl-10-he
graduated senior looks disconsolately ahonl him on the
barm and wonders how he's going to like being a hank
messenger, lie lias just barely scraped through his required
courses in economics and sociology, but it takes little more
than his native horse-sense to divine an upswing.
The man of sits brooding, envying the classes of \'H,
'.'Mi, el cctcru, ad in/inil urn, envisioning the Stanford
which will be theirs. In his mind's eye he sees a I diversity
where men and women students will occupy a more ncarlv
even social footing, a campus life fanned to a rosier, more
normal complexion by an increased velocity in the winds
of freedom.
And behind those dream pictures is the reality of an
afternoon meeting of the Stanford Hoard of Trustees, a
meeting in which those gentlemen decided that Five Hun
dred were not enough and that the Assembly Hall had out
lived its usefulness as a theatre. The trustees are at the
bottom of the upswing. Their ''aves," and Stanford has
more than Five Hundred women students and a new the
atre, a better social situation, a better dramatic situation,
and a you knew it would come to this- better economic
situation.
Ibil llic man of still looks on sadly. He leaves on
I lie eve of the upswing, lie says farewell as his Stanford
again rejoins the ranks of progressive, building universities.
