# A 						Disquieting Rumor That, It Is Hoped, Wall Remain a Rumor

### 
I'robably without basis but {thinning even ;is an un
substantiated rumor is the report current on the campus
lately Unit the administration may in the near future lower
entrance requirements.
It tins been impossible to track down the rumor or to
find any creditable basis for the hint that the financial bug
aboo is behind it. Two recent administrative acts, both of
which meet with comment in this column today, have been
prompted by economic stringencies. Only a crisis in the
t diversity treasury, it is hoped, would cause such action
to be taken.
It seems certain that no action on the part of the ad
ministration would meet with such universal condemna
tion on the part of the student body. That lowering of the
requirements would be regarded us a dimming of the I Di
versity's prestige was definitely indicated by as much of
student opinion ;is could be gathered last night.
In light of the financial reasons behind the rumored
action, it would be well to consider that with Stanford
reduced to the rank of any other Western university, many
possible entrants would not consider paving the much
higher tuition tees; receiving no more in academic returns,
students would have no cause to prefer Stanford not at
a $1 I I premium.
I lie report is of course still in the unverified rumor
stage. I'or the sake of the (diversity, and in light of uni
versal student disapproval, it is hoped that it will remain
in this stage.
