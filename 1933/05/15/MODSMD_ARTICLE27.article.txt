# A
						More Equitable Method Of Cutting the Faculty's Salaries
## 
### 
The salary reduction which the Stanford faculty must i
lake is imforlunate I»uI necessary to Ihc m;iintcnance of the
t nivcrsitv and, more particularly, to the continuance of'
the student loan fund. I! docs seem, however, that some |
more equitable means of staying within the prescribed
budget than ;i straight leu per cent cut could have been '
found.
There are many members of the faculty whose pay isj
large enough so that a cut <>1 as little as ten per cent will
make little difference to them, particularly in times such I
as these w hen costs have dropped almost in half. On the j
other hand there are those to whom such a cut will mean
a great deal.
Ihc reduction alTects all those whose salary is more
than #1000 a year and there are many more close to this,
border line than there are in Ihc upper brackets. To each
"I these a salary cut of this size comes as a very distinct
hardship. Wages of around only #100 a month are low
enough without any deduction.
The fairer and much more logical way of balancing the
I Diversity budget would be a cut which graduated in per
centage. A lopping of larger amounts from the bigger in
comes and less and less from the smaller would help to
equalize the unfortunate bill necessary burden.
