# BULL SESSION
## THE 						WAY OF ALL THINGS 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
Financially, there is no argument;
there never is financially. If 1.000
more women will net the University
: s:;00,000 annually; and Stanford
i needs that $300,000, let 'em in. I
i would almost justify a bank robbery
' to keep Stanford going; and opening
1 the Farm to two more "500's" is not
j as bad as bank robbing—not quite
i as bad. At least, they don't send you
! (o Folsom for the former.
Now, having justified the Amazon
i Invasion, nothing remains to be
j done but sit down in a quiet cor
| ner (with or without a bottle of
| beer) and weep bitter tears. Weep,
! because the Stanford that is today
will not be tomorrow. The Stanford
that will be may be better than this
one; but it will be different. That
alone is occasion for tears.
I
j
The world we go to after our hec
tic dance on this speck is reported
to be infinitely better; all the
prophets agree to that. Yet much is j
j the weeping before the final hop is
j made. The myriad advantages of
j 1,500 (or more) women infesting the
j Farm are very enticing—just like
j the glories of the Hereafter. But, ■
like the glories of the Afterthis, they
are so vague and nebulous that, with
Hamlet, we prefer to hang on to
| what we already have than jump
I into holes whose bottoms we know
i r<ot where they end.
This argument is particularly con
| vincing when one is sure that the
j present Stanford is pretty fine. It
(becomes doubly convincing when
j one is equally sure that the "Farm"
cluttered with skirts will be just i

Iso many skirts worse. At present
Stanford is a man's school with 500
women in attendance—in a mild sort
of way, of course. With 1,500 women
it will be a woman's school with
the men hanging around. At best, it ,
, will be co-educational.. That is seri
ous indictment enough.
I
A man's school breeds by neces
sity male friendships. The girl at
Mills and the babe in the City are
week-end fancies—nothing more.
But. add 1,000 females to this cam
pus, and a lot of big, strong men I
are going to become less big and
| strong. Their disgust and indiffer
ence to the sorority parlor will be j
miraculously lost as soon as there
are more parlors and more women
: in them.
Male companionship is splendid
. but, given men with roving hor- I
rnones and women with roving eyes, 1
and the "women aren't so bad after
ali." Nathan summed it up when
he said that the company of one
intelligent man was worth that of
10 beautiful women, but that lie
would choose the 10 women. Sol
would every other man.
Stanford has built a spirit — a j
spirit of vigor that; gave birth to the
"rough"-—which sounds like the be
ginning of an 1880 spell-binding |
oration, admittedly. But it is true
none the less. The depression has
forced President Wilbur and the I
Trustees to dip that vigo rin sweet l
lilac and lily-of-the-valley. The
dough is to be buried beneath an
avalanche of milk chocolates, hon- I
eyed words, and blonde hair. It is
to weep.
