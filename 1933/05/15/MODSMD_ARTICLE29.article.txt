A SUIt V E Y O F RECORDED
, AMERICAN MUSIC—III: Chas
ms, Jannsen, Shilkrct, Hauhicl.
Another young American 1o be
encouraged by Victor is Abram
Chasins, concert pianist and mem
ber of the faculty of the Curtis In
stitute of Music in Philadelphia. He
has attracted considerable attention
in the East of late- through per
' formanees of his works by the Phil—
j adelphia and New York Orchestras.
There is a sparkle and dash in his
music that is hard to duplicate
j among contemporary composers, and
'although he gives his pieces thor
j oughly modern treatment, he dis
i likes affectation and displays a con
sistently skillful workmanship.
Recently Victor issued, as the
record of the month in the field of
great music, Mr. Chasins' interpre
tation of four of his own composi
tions, Fairy Tale, and Preludes 5,
13, and 14. It has also announced
future release of Three Chinese
Pieces, which bear the interesting

titles: Flirtation in a Chinese Gar
den, Rush Hour in Hong Kong, and
Shanghai Tragedy.
Lovers of boisterously descriptive
music will enjoy New Year's Eve
in New York, by Werner Jannsen.
As one listens to the performance by
Shilkret and the Victor Symphony
orchestra, one wonders if the micro
phone wasn't actually moved to the
center of Broadway as the chimes
strike 12 and usher in the new year
to the celebrating thousands. The
fourth side of these recordings is
occupied by Nathaniel Shilkret's
own interesting composition, Sky
ward, written to commemorate
Byrd's flight across Ihe Atlantic.
Because it won the Schubert Cen
tennial Contest, Charles Haubiel's
symphonic work, Karma, was re
leased in album form by Columbia.
Mr. Haubiel is a member of the fac
ults of New York University. Hi.s
mu.sie is a direct reaction against
the modern dissonant school, and
looks more to the past for its
method. — Dahl

A SUIt V E Y O F RECORDED
, AMERICAN MUSIC—III: Chas
ms, Jannsen, Shilkrct, Hauhicl.
Another young American 1o be
encouraged by Victor is Abram
Chasins, concert pianist and mem
ber of the faculty of the Curtis In
stitute of Music in Philadelphia. He
has attracted considerable attention
in the East of late- through per
' formanees of his works by the Phil—
j adelphia and New York Orchestras.
There is a sparkle and dash in his
music that is hard to duplicate
j among contemporary composers, and
'although he gives his pieces thor
j oughly modern treatment, he dis
i likes affectation and displays a con
sistently skillful workmanship.
Recently Victor issued, as the
record of the month in the field of
great music, Mr. Chasins' interpre
tation of four of his own composi
tions, Fairy Tale, and Preludes 5,
13, and 14. It has also announced
future release of Three Chinese
Pieces, which bear the interesting

titles: Flirtation in a Chinese Gar
den, Rush Hour in Hong Kong, and
Shanghai Tragedy.
Lovers of boisterously descriptive
music will enjoy New Year's Eve
in New York, by Werner Jannsen.
As one listens to the performance by
Shilkret and the Victor Symphony
orchestra, one wonders if the micro
phone wasn't actually moved to the
center of Broadway as the chimes
strike 12 and usher in the new year
to the celebrating thousands. The
fourth side of these recordings is
occupied by Nathaniel Shilkret's
own interesting composition, Sky
ward, written to commemorate
Byrd's flight across Ihe Atlantic.
Because it won the Schubert Cen
tennial Contest, Charles Haubiel's
symphonic work, Karma, was re
leased in album form by Columbia.
Mr. Haubiel is a member of the fac
ults of New York University. Hi.s
mu.sie is a direct reaction against
the modern dissonant school, and
looks more to the past for its
method. — Dahl
