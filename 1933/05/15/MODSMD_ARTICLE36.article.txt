# TWENTY-FOUR FEET AND A SNAP OF THE FINGERS
## 
### 
Mary Ilahlcs ran up and down
the countryside before the sec
ond S.C. meet betting one and
all (you know, a gentleman's
bet) that Paul Zachcs wouiu~fcÂ£
over 21 feet to win the broad
jump. /aches won all right, but
lie didn't have to reach the dis
tance stipulated by Mrs. Ilahlcs.
But Saturday, a Stanford broad
jumper did exceed 24 feel. Phil
Williams done it, by gosh, and he is
the first Stanford broad-jumper
within the memory of my three
year tenure of the Farm to ac
complish same.
