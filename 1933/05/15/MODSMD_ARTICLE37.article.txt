if Harold Osborne's world's high

For (hose who do no! quite
comprehend this changed high
jump standard business, it is sim

rested against the uprights and
on a little peg that extended from
said standards. Thus the bar was
in an Ij-iike notch, and clever
junipers could hold the bar
against the standards while jump

tradition (hat his record was un
breakable.
