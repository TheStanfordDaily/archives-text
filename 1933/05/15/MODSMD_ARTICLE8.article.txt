ELKHORN, Wis., May 14 (/P) â€”
Enraged farmers, waging their milk
strike, today battled through dense
clouds of tear gas south of Muk
wonago to dump six truck loads of
milk destined for the Chicago mar
ket.
Fists and clubs flew as strikers
put non-strikers to flight, aifd from
a few rods distant deputy sheriffs
tossed the gas bombs which made
400 farmers and truck drivers gasp
for air and cover their eyes,
