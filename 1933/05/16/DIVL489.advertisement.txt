INDULGING
THE
SPRING FEVER'
Now grass is green and birds
go 'tweet' .... And classes
drag on leaden feet .... We
envy tramps and other loaf
ers .... Who sprawl on
mossy banks or sofas ....
Till finally we just cave in
.... And let our worser
natures win .... And, clad
tor comfort in PALAKAS
.... We sprawl as carcfrec
as Kanakas.
