"A building where concentrated
work could be done in all phases of
drama, without conflict of other en
tertainment," is hoped -for by Har
old Helvenston, Director of Dra
matics, in the proposed new theatre
for Stanford.
Helvenston yesterday explained
that the value of such a building
would lie in elaboration for the in
creased number of courses in dra
matics, and the therefore greater
opportunity for students to develop
self-expression. For the debater
who "talks with his hands in his
pockets," and the future speakers
(though they may not know it now)
of women's clubs, there would be
plenty of trainfng in a theatre de
i voted entirely to the work of the
dramatics group.
Other entertainments, aptitude
tests, and assemblies which are im
p<.riant activities of the University,

hinder the concentrated work of the
dramatics department, Helvenston
said.
Regarding the physical aspect of
the theatre, he said:
"We should rather have a per
fectly plain building without dev
iations and know it functions acous
tically, visually, and technically,
than something beautiful without
and not technically perfect within."
According to the dramatics di
rector, the finest theatres are those
of which the mass and line distinctly
proclaim them theatres, and which
are plain. It is the interior func
tioning which makes the theatre.
Helvenston hopes that the carry
ing out of the theatre plans would
increase the Stanford prestige
enough to make more students tal
ented in dramatics want to come, to
profit by opportunity greater than
the University now offers them.
