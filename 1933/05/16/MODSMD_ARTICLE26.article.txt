# Bonus Marchers Again Peaceful After Rioting
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 15 (/P) â€”
Harmony reigned again tonight in
the bonus marchers' encampment at
Fort Huna, Va., after a stormy
opening session during which 200
of the marchers heatedly left the
meeting and later returned.
Fiery charges of "steamroller
methods" were hurled at the con
vention as the group departed after
George A. Bray, chairman of the
meeting, declared a motion "out of
order," and was sustained by the
marchers.
