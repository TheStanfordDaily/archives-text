### B KELLOGG 
REVOLUTIONARY actions that have been jolting Stanford undergradu
ates for (lie past four days stood sftll yesterday as President Ray
Lyman Wilbur turned his attention to other quarters. Dean Mary Yost
and Dr. Wilbur met yesterday afternoon to discuss the student-prophesied
Hood of women expected next fall but did little more than rake over the
coals. President Wilbur explained the actions of the Board of Trustees
when he said that its desire was to guide Stanford through "a difficult
period with as little error as possible."
Dean Yost yesterday said that the limit of women admitted would he
governed by the living quarters next fall. This fact will be made clear to

high-school principals and junior
college deans in announcements be
ing sent to them. Miss Yost said.
Possibilities for living quarters
were undetermined late yesterday,
according to Dean Yost and Presi
dent Wilbur, who both said that this
was one of the details that would
be worked out between now and the
fall quarter.
An anxious Women's Council yes
terday afternoon heard Dean Yost
explain the Board of Trustee's ac
tion and present the latest turn of
developments.
Dean Yost said that 328 women's
applications had been accepted for
next fall. Of this number 202 were
starting freshmen; 40 advanced
lower division; 52 upper division
students; and 34 graduates. This
means that about 150 more applica
tions than usual have been accepted,
she said.
Fears that the added new wo
men would cause a rush to get
rooms in Roblc were stilled yes
terday by Dean Yost. She said
that women now living in Roble
would have precedent over any
new students.
To sum up the situation she
said: "Women are no longer
thought of as an addition but as a
vital part of Stanford."
At an A.W.S. dinner Thursday
night Dr. Wilbur, Dean Yost, and
Professor Edgar Eugene Robinson,
director of citizenship, will further
explain the conditions to the women
students.
