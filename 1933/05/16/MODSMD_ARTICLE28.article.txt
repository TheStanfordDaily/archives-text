# R.O.T.C. Loses Two Captains
## 
### 
Despite the fact that two of the
live officers attached to Stanford's
R.O.T.C. unit have been called
away for an indefinite period, all
regular R.O.T.C. work will continue
as usual, according to an announce
ment last night by Colonel Donald
Cubbison, head of the military de
partment.
The two officers who have left,
arc Captain Stewart Miller and Cap
tain Richard Gordon. They have
both been ordered to Monterey
where they will instruct recruits in
the new Civilian Conservation Corps.
The loss of Captain Gordon is a blow
to the Stanford Polo team, and polo
may be abandoned for the remain -
der of the quarter. This morning
will also witness the last of the
morning jumping classes for the
quarter since the other officers will
be too busy to conduct the class.
All other classes will be con
ducted on schedule by the remain
ing officers and there is no founda
tion to the rumor that all military
activities may be suspended for the
remainder of the quarter.
