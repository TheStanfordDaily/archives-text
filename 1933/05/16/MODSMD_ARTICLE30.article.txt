# "Fourth Estate" Smells Blood As Politics Come Out from Under the Rose

Student polities }il Stanford graduate from Ihc rank
of sub rasa activities today, will) the publication, on the
l'roill page of this issue, of a story concerning tomorrow
night's ball-independent caucus. Although the hall caucus
has gone on for years, the fact that the whole thing is to
be open and above-board Ibis year is somehow significant.
It portends that student politicians, no longer wearing a
bang-dog expression, no longer obliged to deny or apolo
gize for their maneuvering, may effect a change in the blase
campus attitude which lias frequently resulted in inefficient
and indifferent student government in the past.
The hall politicians are to be congratulated for their
courage in bringing their activities out into the open. It is
;i brave step, daring, as it does, the ridicule of a large, non
chalant portion of the campus.
Heyond ils bravery, however, the step appears to pos
sess lew virtues. For one thing, it once more directs atten
tion to the almost- forgotten Hall-How controversy, one
which has been pretty nearly laughed away in recent years.
Ibis the hall caucus accomplishes by issuing specific invi
tations to three classifications of students, all non-Greek.
Whether the resultant choices in the forthcoming A.S.S.U.
elections are sufficiently happy to justify a little renewed
fanning of the Hall-How flame remains to be seen. The
I fall caucus does not, as yet, stand condemned.
The How, of course, is immediately thrown on the de
fensive. How the How will respond it is difficult to presage.
Hut one thing is certain. With polilics assuming the mantle
of public importance on the campus, student politics may
expect the public notice in the press which o/her non-secre
tive political activities receive.
