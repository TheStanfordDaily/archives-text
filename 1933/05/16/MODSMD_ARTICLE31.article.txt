# A 						Pessimistic Viewpoint of Stanford Standards, in Six Paragraphs
## 
### 
Yesterday's announcement of a "Prom Girl" for a cam
pus dance this weekend would seem to he in line with other
recent publicity campaigns on the level of those employed
hv dance press-agents of southern California colleges.
Perhaps the campus has come to accept this sort of
thing, even to like it. Hut there was a time, in the memory
ol the present student generation, when such tactics were
regarded as savoring not of representative Stanford life,
hut of the hippodroming whoopla of the Hollywood col
lege.
It may he true that nearly all of the nation's institutions
of learning are of this type; if so, it is unfortunate. It may
also he true that Stanford is at last conforming to the
standards of the majority. This, if true, is even more un
fortunate. For forty years, the I diversity has held itself
rather alooi Irom typically collegiate standards and alti
tudes, continuing to regard achievement of an education
as the primary aim of four years on a campus.
I his may he an obsolete viewpoint. With only a few
valiant exceptions, it has come to be obsolete throughout
tin' nation's colleges. It is apparently corning to be obso
lete now on even this campus.
Not far distant, perhaps, is the time when Stanford
shall be no different from the rank and file of America's
notoriously immature colleges. To one who came to the
t diversity in it seems a saddening change, an altera
tion almost tragic.
But it seems inevitable.
