# Europe Refutes the Theory That History Is a Profitable Study
## 
### 
Almost nil high school history courses are prefaced by
a list of reasons for studying lite subject. Thev are dinned
into the student's ear until they lake 011 the aspect of in-!
fallibility. (.liief among these is one which commends the,
study ot history on the ground that it permits one to benefit
by the mistakes of the past.
I heorclieally this reason is perfect; practically it is 1
worthless. A reading of history itself will prove how little 1
cflect tormcr mistakes have had on later generations. The
statement that "history repeats itself" comes much closer!
to covering the situation.
Certainly it history were not enough to disprove the j
theory the day's news would he. War clouds hover omi
nously over Kuropc while men still preach the horror of
the last great conflict. Hitler continues his medieval per
secution of a race whose whole history is one of persecu
tion. History has nothing to teach such a man as this.
Japan, too, continues to ignore historical promptings. If
she is satisfied that war is not a mistake at least it would
seem plain that it is a mistake to think that any country!
can subdue C.hina. f
It seems rather obvious that the world learns little
through a knowledge of past mistakes.
