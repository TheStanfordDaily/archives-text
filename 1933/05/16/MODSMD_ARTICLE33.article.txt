### ABE MELLINKOFF 
BACK-HANDED SUPPORT I RO.M THE EDITOR

As long as my chief, the Editor of
the Daily, praises the Trustees and
the President for yanking Stanford
out of the Red Sea and into the
Green Pastures, my hozannas drown
out his. But our paths separate at the
dollar mark. Our paths separate be
cause mine ends there while his
trails out into the golden haze of the
future. He justifies the Amazon In
vasion by the regrets of passing sen
iors.
But in reality, it is the chop-lick
ing anticipations of the seniors at the
possibility of a woman-infested Quad
that proves that the wave of women
is nothing more than a financial
necessity. It is only natural that at
the first flush of his animal sense, the
senior should long for myriads of
women. He would need medical ex
amination and a possible re-classifi
cation if it were any other way.

The male idea of paradise has al
ways been women. It seems to be
the one thing that does not follow
the economic law of marginal desir
ability. I have yet to find a man who
thought there were too many women
at the party. Sure, a lot of "horse
sense" seniors are in favor of an
other 1,000 women at Stanford. These
same people would probably be in
favor of another 5,000 —another
10,000.
These seniors would probably also
be in favor of decreasing the num-'
ber of men to one—he being the one.
No, he probably would want a room
mate to whom he' could relate his

I amorous conquests. But it would be
still better probably if that room
mate commuted to San Jose State,
returning only at meal times to hear
the wondrous tales of his triumphs
with the 5,000 co-eds.
If the drooling lamentations of
soon-to-be-departed seniors is to be
taken as a criterion, I know some
ether "upswings" that can be swung.
Of course, ever popular would be
the"abolition of classes. That would
strike a decisive upswing in the
popularity of universities. Probably
the most fundamental complaint with
the University is the necessity of
i sitting in an un-upholstered chair
! while some prof (secretly bemoan
ing his 10 per cent cut) lectures on
t.nd on about the subject at hand.
Then, stock the library exclusive
ly with S. S. Van Dine and Tiffany
Thayer (who despite being the au
thor of "13 Men," "13 Women," and
a hinted new thriller, "Raw Sex,
Yum, Yum," still is lucky—lucky in
I not being put out of his misery).
This improvement plus free copies
of the Saturday Evening Post and
1 free fags would put the University
over with a bang. A jaeppy floor
show would also help.
' Yes, a few senior men in whom
the vision of 1,500 or more women
fans their .social interest to a white
heat, applaud the change. The rest
who realize that a chocolate sundae
and a woman are both things of
beauty and attractiveness wish small
amounts of both."
