A BEDTIME STORY (Paramount)
—At the Stanford Theatre.
Someone discovered that a baby—
the smaller the better—will bring a
variety of pleased exclamations from
even the most sophisticated audi
| ence, and will charm everyone in
! general. The result is "A Bedtime
; Story."
I And it is this very clever baby
| under a very clever director (Nor
j man Taurog) that makes the film
| excellent entertainment. To be sure,
i the film is a starring vehicle for
1 Maurice Chevalier, and it cannot
j be said that the baby steals the
| show, but he makes a major con
! tribution in his one-syllabled way.
I And close behind is Edward Everett
! Horton, who again demonstrates
| that he is a comedian of no mean
; ability.
It is distinctly to the credit of the
star that he is so liberal in allowing
the spotlight 1o his supporting play
i ers. The result is that the three of
I them combine to give a definite
! charm to this light and innocuous
| (except for one bland sequence)
, picture.
The plot is insignificant, dealing
as it does with the adoption by
Chevalier of the baby, after his dis
covery that the child has a pro
[ truding lower lip not unlike his
| own. The scene in which he and
i Horton, as the valet, make this
' alarming discovery is adroitly han
\ died.
! The musical interludes inevitable
| to a Chevalier film are well-han
i died, and the star sings three at
j tractive songs in a less obtrusive
! manner than usual. His performance
is natural and charming and on the
whole not exaggerated.
Morton's performance as the valet
! is delightful, especially in his pan
tc mime, and Helen Twelvetrees is
satisfactory, if not startling, as the
heroine. —Chapin

| I should not waste space com
menting upon "Pleasure Cruise"
| were it not a near duplication of
! Molnar's witly "Guardsman," but
| a duplication slow, tasteless, and
j dull.
A jealous husband sends his wife

I oft on a vacation voyage and then,
disguised variously as a barber and
King Neptune, spies upon her. What
makes this vulgar while Molnar's
play is brilliant comedy, I frankly
cannot discover.
The players in both films are ex
pert comedians so the obvious an
swer set down to bad playing must
be dismissed. Too, the viewpoint is
the same: in each the husband is
made a ridiculous figure, the wife
at first an innocent flirt and, at the
end, an adept at answering ques
j tions.
But whereas Molnar skirts the
! danger point with extreme agility
j and exquisite understatement, the
corcoeter of Pleasure Cruise not
only present clearly the incident
lof the bedroom-conquest, but dal-
Kes nastily with it. This leering at
titude is, I am inclined to think, the
i reason for the film's unpleasantness.
It all seems very commonplace, as
if it had been taken from yester
i day's extra edition.
Consequently Roland Young's
most stn ught-f aced efforts have not
the slightest redeeming effect nor,
j I regret to say, do his antics seem
at all funny. The rest of the cast Ls
! likewise hampered. In all, the film
i.s a very dismal effort. —Sandoe
