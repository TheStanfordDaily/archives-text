. ."BYRON—Traffic at the Old River
bridge halted yesterday while a
barge passed through. Adjoining the
highway at this point is a Japanese
vegetable garden graced with three
unusually realistic scarecrows. The
one nearest the highway stands
nonchalantly leaning on a hoe with
hir back to the road.
During the halt a motorist stuck
his head out of the window and
shouted an inquiry as to the road.
No answer. He tried three times
with the same result and then, ap
parently highly incensed, got out of
his car. vaulted the fence, and took
a healthy wallop at the unrespon
sive 'farmer.'

ground, he climbed in his car and
drove off amid the laughter of other
waiting motorists."

Re "Princeton Prince" (Time,
April 24), should not Time have
added that Prasob Sukhsvasti
(Siamese prince expelled from
Princeton for alleged wild parties)
is now enrolled in Miami Univer

There once was a Prince of Siam
Said, "For Princeton I don't give

Though they do not salaam me,
I like old Miami.
