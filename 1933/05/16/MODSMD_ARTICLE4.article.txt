# Columbia Students War For Econ Instructor
## 
### 
NEW YORK, May 15 (/I s)â€”Stu
dents clashed in free-for-all fights
across the campus of Columbia Uni
versity today as the aftermath of a
strike to protest the authorities'
failure to renew the contract of
Donald Henderson, radical instructor
in economics.
Eyes were blackened, eggs were
thrown, clothes were torn, and
Anti-Henderson students inadvert
ently played a hose on police when
the stream failed to reach the
demonstrators.
