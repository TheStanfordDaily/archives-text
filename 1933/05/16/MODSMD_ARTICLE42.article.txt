### Richard "Bugs" Strouse 
Jim Ferrie tried to impersonate-
Ben Eastman in the two-mile relay
rlown at Fresno and the officials
laid back their ears and hollered i
i. » i
no.
All the other running boys said,
'Sure, let him race," but after Stan
ford had won the officials decided
that "Southern would
look better engraved on the backs j
of the watches than would "Stan- i
ford."
Maybe they eat more raisins down ;
arcund Los Angeles.
Ben's big brother Sam imperson- j
• led Ben by his swell running, jHe
started behind Ferris Webster and
finished ahead of him. And the offi- j
Cuds couldn't disqualify Sam be- j
cause his name was Eastman.
I suppose that if Ferrie had been j
named Rothert, the officials would
have given him a first in the shot. |
They are the same officials who
gave second place in the high-jump j
last year to a guy named Goldstein j
or Goldberg who was in Santa Bar- j
bara all during the meet.
After he had read in the papers
tl it he had won a second place,
Goldberg or Goldstein wrote to the
officials for his medal.
But the government wouldn't de
liver the letter. They said it wa.s
intent to defraud through the mails.
Ferrie ran for Lombardi earlier I
in the evening in the half-mile re- (
lay and nobody raised a whimper.
Stanford didn't win that race.
The officials must have noticed j
the unmistakable resemblance be
tween Jim and Frank.
Now all wc need is for the Fresno j
officials to come up here and choosc j
the new women who will be ad- j
milted to Stanford next fall.
If that bunch of one-eyed horse j
thieves tried to allow brains to
matriculate, ,they would come up
with a bunch of beauties who would
mil Ziegfield over in his grave.
But at that such a choice would j
improve Stanford's teams. The ath- |
letes would rush here like hungry j
men evading the Union; they'd find |
thi missing link to Stanford Appeal ;
here at last.
•
The whole Ferrie business arose
because Jim wasn't officially en- j
tered in the two-mile relay.
After this, Dink Templeton will
send the Bawlout down to Fresno
and tell the officials to enter every
one in every event.
And the officials will probably '
write back, "Who is this guy Ray |
Wilbur? A shot-putter?"

Now all wc need is for the Fresno j
officials to come up here and choosc j
the new women who will be ad- j
milted to Stanford next fall.
If that bunch of one-eyed horse j
thieves tried to allow brains to
matriculate, ,they would come up
with a bunch of beauties who would
mil Ziegfield over in his grave.
But at that such a choice would j
improve Stanford's teams. The ath- |
letes would rush here like hungry j
men evading the Union; they'd find |
thi missing link to Stanford Appeal ;
here at last.

The whole Ferrie business arose
because Jim wasn't officially en- j
tered in the two-mile relay.
After this, Dink Templeton will
send the Bawlout down to Fresno
and tell the officials to enter every
one in every event.
And the officials will probably '
write back, "Who is this guy Ray |
Wilbur? A shot-putter?"
Jim Ferrie tried to impersonate-
Ben Eastman in the two-mile relay
rlown at Fresno and the officials
laid back their ears and hollered i
i. » i
no.
All the other running boys said,
'Sure, let him race," but after Stan
ford had won the officials decided
that "Southern would
look better engraved on the backs j
of the watches than would "Stan- i
ford."
Maybe they eat more raisins down ;
arcund Los Angeles.
Ben's big brother Sam imperson- j
• led Ben by his swell running, jHe
started behind Ferris Webster and
finished ahead of him. And the offi- j
Cuds couldn't disqualify Sam be- j
cause his name was Eastman.
I suppose that if Ferrie had been j
named Rothert, the officials would
have given him a first in the shot. |
They are the same officials who
gave second place in the high-jump j
last year to a guy named Goldstein j
or Goldberg who was in Santa Bar- j
bara all during the meet.
After he had read in the papers
tl it he had won a second place,
Goldberg or Goldstein wrote to the
officials for his medal.
But the government wouldn't de
liver the letter. They said it wa.s
intent to defraud through the mails.
Ferrie ran for Lombardi earlier I
in the evening in the half-mile re- (
lay and nobody raised a whimper.
Stanford didn't win that race.
The officials must have noticed j
the unmistakable resemblance be
tween Jim and Frank.
Now all wc need is for the Fresno j
