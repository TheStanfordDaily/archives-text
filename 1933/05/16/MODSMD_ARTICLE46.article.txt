# "Old Fox" On Farm Again
## 
### Oliver Johnston, Jr 
The Old Fox, looking in good
health, summered in California to
day and got his first glimpse at the
1933 Big Red Machine.
Thornhill, a former pupil of War
ner, did not give his old teacher
much of a chance to sec what he
had done to date, as he spent the

whole session in working on funda
mentals. But Pop will have plenty
of time to see the Indians in action
before he leaves for the East again.
Warner stated that the material
at Temple was as good as could
be expected for the first year. lie
said that the biggest trouble was
that there was a small turnout of
only ahout fifty. Warner had ex
pected nearly 125 to be on deck.
Tiny worked the line most of the
afternoon on slow motion blocking.
Meaning by that that the men did
not hit hard bdt worked for preci

sion in timing.
Over on the dummy another for
mer pupil of Pop's drilled the backs.
And don't think that Ernie Nevers
doesn't work his charges hard.
There were only one or two occa
sirns after plays had been run off
that he did not have some criticism
to make.
The team worked on a new fake
pass in which the halves come
around in front of the fullback in
stead of behind him. Nevers is
determined to teach the backs
how to pass well, and consequent

ly the pipkin spent a lot of time
in the air.
Practice ended with a fiery signal
drill, in fact if there are many more
drills like they have been having
lately theC turf will be completely
annihilated.
