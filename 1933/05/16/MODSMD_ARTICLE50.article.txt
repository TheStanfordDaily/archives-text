# INDIAN TRACKMEN WIN WATCHES AT FRESNO CARNIVAL
## 
### 
Four lucky members of Dink
Ternpleton's track squad that com
peted in the Fresno Relays were
able to display to an admiring cam
pus yesterday the wrist watches
that form the bulk of the booty
hi ought back from the Raisin City.
Gus Meier, Johnny Mottram, Gor
don Dunn, and Here Laborde were
the men who carried off the best
Fresno prizes, but the rest of the
team returned with a bag of assorted
gold, silver, and bronze medals
The Stanford men might well have
possessed another set of watches but
for the ruling of the meet judges
who barred the two-mile relay team

as official winners. Jim Ferrie, Sam
Eastman, Dan Murphy, and George
Naylon were disgusted at this action
after they had caught EI Trojan
napping at the switch and slipped
over a win where none was ex
pected.
Dink Templeton protested long
and loudly to the Fresno authori
ties but without avail. The Stanford
quartet had to console themselves
with the thought that, after all, it
was "amateur" sport.
Yesterday found Les Ilables re
turned to the oval, where he joined
teammate Ben Eastman in plodding
around the cinders. Eastman is
responding to treatment, as shown
by a 3:27 mark for three laps.
Forty-three Denver University
seniors will not be graduated until
