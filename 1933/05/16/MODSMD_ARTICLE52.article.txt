## WALTER MARTY, HIGH JUMP ACE, NONCHALANT OVER RECENT FEAT 
### WILLARD BUNGAY Feg Murray, '16 
Saturday night at Fresno a tall,
blond youth, thin as a rail, aston
ished the sports world by high
jumping 6 feet 8 and •";« inches to
establish a new world's record. The
next morning this same tall blond
youth, a student at Fresno State
College, nonchalantly donned an old
pair of overalls and, stripped to the
waist, went to work tearing down
temporary buildings at the scene of
bis triumph—the Fresno stadium.
This is typical of Walter Marty,
new claimant for a record that was
declared unbreakable. While people
were gasping and gossiping about

hi.s performance over late Sunday
breakfasts, he was earning his 40 ,
cents an hour, along with several I
!
oilier students; unmindful of the fact
that his picture was spread all over ■
the sport pages of almost every
California newspaper.
There was no such thing as in
terviewing him. He? rather embar
rassed ly signed a couple of pro
grams for friends who had hunted
him up, but went right back to
work—either from shyness or be
cause he was afraid the boss might
come around and find him "loafing."
He reminds one a lot of Ben East
mna, does Walter Marty.
