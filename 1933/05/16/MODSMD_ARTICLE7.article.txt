# Hall Caucus Plans Made
## 
### 
Hall politics will come out of the
dark tomorrow night when the an
nual Hall Caucus is called to order
at 7 o'clock in the Toyon lobby.
Invitations to attend the meeting
have been extended to all non-fra
ternity men regardless of where
they live. A concerted drive to have
a complete attendance of men from
the three sections of the hall classi
fication, I—men living in dormi
tories, 2—independents living in
Palo Alto or near the campus, and
3—members of campus eating clubs,
has been conducted during the
past week. Cy Thomas, Sequoia Hall,
leader, will act as chairman tomor
row night.
Tomorrow's meeting will produce
the hall candidates for all A.S.S.U.
offices, Cy Thomas said. Possible
entries in the student election, late
this month, will be considered and
weeded tmtil a handpicked ballot is
checked by the hallmen.
