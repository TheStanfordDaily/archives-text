# Wilde's Play Selected For Reading
## 
### James Sandoe 
After a prolonged search through
dusty volumes, Sword and Sandals
has selected Oscar Wilde's "The
Ideal Husband" as the third reading
in a series of four designed to in
dicate broadly the major trends of
English drama. The play will be
read on Thursday evening, May 18,
in the Little Theatre.
By avoiding such obviously typi -
Ceil dramas as "East Lynne" and
"The Bells," because they have be
come, with time, hilarious bur
lesques, inferior to Sheridan's smili
lai but intentionally satiric "Critic,"
the search narrowed down to six
authors.
Bulwer-Lytton's historical melo
dramas were considered and drop
ped because of their tendencies to
ward stiffness. Stephen Philips'
verse dramas seemed dangerously
inferior to "The Duchess of Main"'
and the bloody verse melodramas
of Browning, Shelley, and Byron
setmed likewise unsuitable.
The comedies of Oscar Wilde, bar
ring "The Importance of Being
Earnest," are not now very well
known. "Lady Windermere's Fan"
suffers from an excess of shocked
adjective which would reduce a
modern audience to laughter in the
play's most serious moments."
Casting is as yet tentative but, re
hearsals have been started. A com
plete cast will be announced in the
near future. The reading will begin
as usual at 7:30 o'clock.
