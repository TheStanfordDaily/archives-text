# Music Series Cut From Next Year Student Program
## Ex Committee Sponsors Reconsideration of Concert For 1935 Season; Change of Booking System Removes Chance for Special Rates 
### JULIUS JACOBS 
STANFORD'S Concert Scries for lf>.'Kl-34 has been abolished. This drastic
step was taken yesterday by the Ex Committee in a final measure to
curb the yearly loss resulting from the student series. The following
motion was approved by the group:
"That the Concert Series be discontinued for l!).'iu-!M with the wish that
the Executive Committee of next year seriously consider the re-establish
incnt of the Series the following year if conditions are satisfactory."
Bruce Bryant, Concert Series manager for the season just ended, pre
sented a summary of the l!K»2-lj:j season, which included such noted events

i's last week's conceit by Yehudi *
Mcnuhin, and conceits by Dino
Eorgioli, Ihe San Francisco Sym
phony, and the Hall Johnson Negro
Chorus.
Lack of Support
Throughout all the concerts, Bry
ant pointed out, there was consider
able lack of support from students
of the University, although campus
opinion before the series was begun !
had shown an overwhelming desire
for its continuation.
Additional evidence against fur
ther support of the series was sub- j
stantiated by the fact that audiences
were composed mainly of Peninsula
music-lovers, although the brunt of
tin series was carried upon the
shoulders of the Associated Stu
dents.
Recommends Action
Any ideas that the discontinuation i
of the Concert Series would be per- i
nianent were quelled by the em
phatic vote of Ex Committee mem
bers in proposing that the problem
bo taken over by next year's execu- j
tive body, its establishment to be
reconsidered, and architectual con
ditions should be more favorable.
Reasons for the final decision
v ere officially adopted by the
Executive Committee in reaching a
verdict. They are as follows:
(1) Student interest does not
warrant a continuation of the
Concert Series. There were .SHOO j
worth of unsold seats at the Men
uliin Concert. If an artist of this j
high calibre could not pack the
Pavilion, it is doubtful if any art
ist could do so.
(2) Because of business consoli
dations and changes, artists will
have to be engaged through a single
booking agent in Los Angeles, with j
the Concert Series losing all bar
gaining advantages gained in the
past through one of two San Fran
lisco booking agencies.
(.'{) There is no feasible means
of subsidizing the Concert Series.
Neither the A.S.S.U. nor the Uni-.J
versity can afford to underwrite j
the series, and any addition to the
quarterly tuition Community Fee
is impractical.
(4) Stanford students should not
have to make up the deficits in- j
curred when the concerts are
patronized largely by off-campus
communities, with Stanford students
only one-fourth of the audience;
nevertheless A.S.S.U. must stand j
all losses.
(.1) It is necessary to make a
cut somewhere, either with Dra
matic Council or Concert Scries.
The former is a more representa
tive student activity, since the
performers themselves are stu
dents.
This last named provision is ex
pected to prove a boo nto campus
d.'.imatic productions.

STANFORD'S Concert Scries for lf>.'Kl-34 has been abolished. This drastic
step was taken yesterday by the Ex Committee in a final measure to
curb the yearly loss resulting from the student series. The following
motion was approved by the group:
"That the Concert Series be discontinued for l!).'iu-!M with the wish that
the Executive Committee of next year seriously consider the re-establish
incnt of the Series the following year if conditions are satisfactory."
Bruce Bryant, Concert Series manager for the season just ended, pre
sented a summary of the l!K»2-lj:j season, which included such noted events

i's last week's conceit by Yehudi *
Mcnuhin, and conceits by Dino
Eorgioli, Ihe San Francisco Sym
phony, and the Hall Johnson Negro
Chorus.
Lack of Support
Throughout all the concerts, Bry
ant pointed out, there was consider
able lack of support from students
of the University, although campus
opinion before the series was begun !
had shown an overwhelming desire
for its continuation.
Additional evidence against fur
ther support of the series was sub- j
stantiated by the fact that audiences
were composed mainly of Peninsula
music-lovers, although the brunt of
tin series was carried upon the
shoulders of the Associated Stu
dents.
Recommends Action
Any ideas that the discontinuation i
of the Concert Series would be per- i
nianent were quelled by the em
phatic vote of Ex Committee mem
bers in proposing that the problem
bo taken over by next year's execu- j
tive body, its establishment to be
reconsidered, and architectual con
ditions should be more favorable.
Reasons for the final decision
v ere officially adopted by the
Executive Committee in reaching a
verdict. They are as follows:
(1) Student interest does not
warrant a continuation of the
Concert Series. There were .SHOO j
worth of unsold seats at the Men
uliin Concert. If an artist of this j
high calibre could not pack the
Pavilion, it is doubtful if any art
ist could do so.
(2) Because of business consoli
dations and changes, artists will
have to be engaged through a single
booking agent in Los Angeles, with j
the Concert Series losing all bar
gaining advantages gained in the
past through one of two San Fran
lisco booking agencies.
(.'{) There is no feasible means
of subsidizing the Concert Series.
Neither the A.S.S.U. nor the Uni-.J
versity can afford to underwrite j
the series, and any addition to the
quarterly tuition Community Fee
is impractical.
(4) Stanford students should not
have to make up the deficits in- j
curred when the concerts are
patronized largely by off-campus
communities, with Stanford students
only one-fourth of the audience;
nevertheless A.S.S.U. must stand j
all losses.
(.1) It is necessary to make a
cut somewhere, either with Dra
matic Council or Concert Scries.
The former is a more representa
tive student activity, since the
performers themselves are stu
dents.
This last named provision is ex
pected to prove a boo nto campus
d.'.imatic productions.
