# EASTMAN MAY RUN SATURDAY AT P.A.A. MEET
## Deacon, Miller Return To Practice; Dunn Makes New Discus Mark 
### 
With the varsity track team's in
jury brigade stubbornly regaining
competitive form, Dink Temp lon is
all set to give his squad one last
slifl workout at the P.A.A. meet in
San Francisco Saturday, and then
load his picked I.C.A.A.A.A. men
into a Boston-bound train.
Although Captain Ben Eastman
appears none too good, there is a
possibility that he may take an 800-
r.ieter jaunt at the P.A.A. Saturday.
Templeton is eager to see how his
middle-distance ace performs under
fire before he turns him loose
against the nation's best at Boston.
At present Ben's old pulled muscle
is holding up well, but he has de
veloped a pronounced limp in his
right leg.
Injuries Ileal
Aside from Captain Eastman,
things arc encouraging. Bud Deacon
yesterday did his first vaulting since
hi.s leg was injured and he was able
tj clear 12 feet G inches several
times with ease. Bill Miller appeared
with a new support for his heel and
he also made several vaults at the
se,me height.
Gordon "Slinger" Dunn proceeded
to do his best work yet with the
discus. Six times the Fresno giant
put the plate out beyond the 155-
foot mark, and once he went over
100 feet.
New Speed Made
Frank Fullenwider pushed Al
Blackmail to the latter's best 440
time, 49 seconds flat. Dink declares
ii to be the second fastest time for
Angel 1 Field, the best, of course,
being held by Eastman.
Jim Ferric, whose specialty is the
mile, but who is also a good half
milcr, turned his attention to the
two-mile yesterday. Ferric ran hi.s
heart out in a time trial attempting
to win a place with Iht I.C.A.A.A.A.
men. He was clocked in 9:54.8,
which would win a lot of dual
meets, but which would not be in
the money at Boston.
