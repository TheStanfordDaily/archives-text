# Thompson Hits Dry Laws; Sees Wets' Triumph
## State Convention for Repeal Deemed Unnecessary 
### Dave Mellinkoff 
1919 is the year when Anti-Saloon
League propaganda was gradually
wheedling the American public out
of "life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness."
In that year the Wyoming legis
lature voted unanimously to ratify
the 18th amendment; Michigan gave
the prohibition statute a 39-1 in
dorsement; and with votes to spare,
Wisconsin and Rhode Island drys
carried their states for Neal Dow
and Carrie Nation.
1933 — Wyoming, Michigan, Wis
consin vote overwhelmingly to re
peal the constitutional conundrum.
What does this mean?
Despite doleful dry predictions
that a 13-state block will hojkl up '
the repealer, Dr. Walter Thomp
son. associate professor of political
science, believes that "the wet
wave will not recede until repeal
and legitimate liquor trade" have
been written into the laws of the
land.
Said he: "It will probably take
some time before the states pass the
measure, but the drys are complete
ly demoralized, and I think it will
go through."
Indicating that the present han
dling of beer and wine sales was far
from satisfactory, Dr. Thompson
s.'.id: "Now is the time to begin
thinking of what we are going to do
after repeal. That is our problem."
"Since the will of Californians
has already been expressed
through repeal of the Wright
Act." Thompson does not think it
necessary to submit repeal to a
popularly elected state convention.
By eliminating a popular vote, the
state would save at least $200,000.
The Thompson plan would call for
the state legislature's resolving
itself into a convention for the
purpose of considering the repeal
amendment. It would cost approx
imately three cents —the cost of
mailing the result of the vote to
Washington.
