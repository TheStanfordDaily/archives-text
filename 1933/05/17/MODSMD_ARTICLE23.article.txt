# Wilbur Revises Admission Rule To Meet Crisis
## Entrance Committee Will Make Use of Available Power To Admit Applicants Lacking Needed High School Requirements 
### 
pRESIDENT KAY LYMAN WILBUR today cleared up all doubts about
entrance requirements that have been the subject of rumors since the
lifting of the 500 ban.
"Applicants may be admitted who present less than 15 entrance units', at
the discretion of the entrance committee," stated President Wilbur, "pro
vided they pass the aptitude test in group one, and present superior
personality records."
This is not, he pointed out, a new policy of the administration, bill
merely making use of powers that have always been available for the

committee if they had need to use
them.
More Vacancies Now
He explained that up to this time,
when the quota of 450 or 350 ad
mitted in each class all presented
16 units, those who fell below that
standard were not considered. Now
Ihat there are many vacancies,
meaning a great loss of income for
the University, places will be filled
by applicants who have Jess than 15
units of recommending grade.
"Inasmuch as there are several
hundred applicants each year who
fall below the 15-unit standard."
the President said "it will not be
made a general practice to let in
everyone. The rule has always
existed in the past, whereby ap
plicants could be admitted with
less than the usual number of
recommendations, provided their
aptitude test and personality rat
ings were considered satisfactory
by the committee.
"Several candidates have been ad
mitted in the past under this l'ule;
and of course many more will be in
the future, especially under the
stress of economic conditions as wo
find ourselves today. I do not know
whether committee will admit
enough under these conditions to
fill the quota of 450 for the fall
quarter or not."
Not Changing Policy
In making this announcement,
which will come as a surprise to
many students and especially It)
those who hope to come to Stan
ford, President Wilbur pointed out
that the administration is not chang
ing its policy in any way, nor lower
ing the entrance standards from
what they have always been in
meeting (he financial crisis the Uni
versity now finds itself in. Rather
they are merely making use of
powers that have been the com
mittee's to use whenever they so
desired.
