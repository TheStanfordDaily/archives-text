# The
						Concert Series Is Dead, Long Live the Dramatic Council
## 
### 
Stanford's Concert Series is no more. The Executive
Committee has decreed that it will be discontinued, at
least for next year. The reason, of course, is the fact that
il failed to meet expenses, due largely to lack of campus
support.
As tine as the artists have been, the number of students
in attendance has obviously not warranted the series' con
tinuance. Even the support of off-campus music lovers lias
not been sullicient.
The fad that there were over a thousand dollars' worth
of tickets unsold for the Menuhin concert, one of the best
of the series, shows how little interest was shown. A Jack
of money on the campus certainly explains a good deal
but even that is not the whole story. Even in the best of
years the series is none too well supported.
The Ex. Committee finds that it is necessary to make a
cut somewhere; they deem it better to lop off the series
than to cut the Dramatic Council allowance. This is un
doubtedly a correct step though the fact remains that any
one of the artists is more worthy of attention than the best
effort of the Dramatic Council. However, it is easier to
ballyhoo a campus play at "><l cents to a dollar than a vio
linist at a dollar to a dollar and a half. After all the results
do not add lo the profits; it is the advertising that counts.
In any event the campus should regret the passing, for
even one year, of one of Stanford's few cultural aspects.
