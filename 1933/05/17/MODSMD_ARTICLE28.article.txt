# Out from Under the Rose, But for More Reasons Than One
## 
### 
"Out from under Iho rose," read yesterday's editorial
commenting upon the action of hail leaders in bringing 1 1 if
annual hall caucus into public view, abandoning the se
crecy that lias characterized local politics for as long as
lite present college generation can remember, and for some
tune before that.
The courage of the slrp was commented upon, daring,
as it does, the ridicule of a large, nonchalant portion of
the campus.
Other aspects of the move received less favorable no
tice. Chief among the objections was a possible quicken
ing of the smouldering hall-Row rivalry, a rivalry that has
enlivened and embittered many a campus dog-light in the
past.
It appears now that the chief reason behind the change
in policy is not to create more How-hall enmity, but to
save the student government the cost of two or more elec
tions. Through the "weeding out" process only one elec
tion is ncccssarv l<> make linal selections. Kacli election,
it is revealed, costs the A.S.S.I', between twenty-live and
thirty dollars.
I bill leaders have further desired the Daii.v to clarify
their position about an alleged anti-How feeling. No such
thing is further from their thoughts in organizing tonight's
meeting, they claim. The culling process of a ball caucus
would be impossible to students not having enough knowl
edge of personalities !â– ; help in the selection. Above all,
they continue, ll"' caucus is not intended io be binding in
the sense that it is a political party opposed to the Row as
another political party. "There is no need," they chorus,
"for hall-How enmity."
All this, if true, is very good. It tells of a desire to sim
plify and reduce the costs of campus elections. It shows a
wish to let the embers of rivalry die out. Hut chiclly it is
indicative of a laudable ambition to vitalize the choosing
of the student body's leaders, To make their selection an
integral part of Stanford life.
