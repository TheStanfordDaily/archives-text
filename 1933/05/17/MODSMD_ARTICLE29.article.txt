# BULL SESSION
## 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
Another Bonus Army is marching
on Washington. Another ragged
bunch of unemployed who happened
to have worn ill-fitting khaki 16
years ago is collecting in the soup
and bread lines around the national
capitol. The Roosevelt Administra
tion will soon be as embarrassed as
was the Hoover. We hope I hey don't
relieve their embarrassment in the
same way.
Our heroes of The War which
made the country safe and profit
able for New York stock brokers
have been a national problem ever
since. Little did anyone think that
when they marched away to the
tune of the "Stars and Stripes For
ever" they would return singing,
"I've Got You in the Palm of My
Hand." But that is a fact. The
Legion, an organized minority, has
ably decked itself in red, white, and
biue, and persisted in holding the
ciub over Congress. For years we
have been paying money to every
middle-aged veteran who developed
anything from fiat feet to dandruff.
As long as the land flowed with
milk, honey, and increasing divi
dends, that was all well. The people
then who criticized the Legion were
branded as radicals, socialists, if not
actual Soviet agents. Now, however,
with an unbalancable budget, the
spending of millions for the veterans
looks too much like an organized
gouging on a national scale. People
art beginning to feel that all that
shouts is not patriotic.
The big bonus argument is that

while "we soldiers were away hold
ing the enemy from the front door,
the stay-at-homes grew rich nuts in
the back yard and roasted them in
the fireplace." That is true; but un
fortunate. Everybody should have
stayed home and reaped big divi
dends. That was the error. The
profits of war should be absorbed
by the government. They pay the
bills. It is only business sense.
The men who stay at home should
have every penny of war profit
tixed right out of their cash-regis
ters. Those who go across should
realize that $1 a day and beans is
their sole remuneration. No bonus
pot at the end of the rainbow.
Everyone would be less anxious for
war. The terrible atrocities become
less, terrible in the absence of boom
ing prices and rising profits. Human
sympathies work that way.
Besides being a constarlt drain on
the treasury and for the second
time a serious embarrassment to
Washington, the veterans have been
ever with us in other ways as well,
Local Legionnaires have attempted
to maintain the 1917 jingoism at its
wartime fervor. They have been ac
tive in attacking "reds" and other
"enemies of the Constitution." In a
world that is forgetting the World
War and its unsophisticated antics,
these men have continually kept
their lips glued to the blatant bugles
of babbitry.
Whether it is emotional fixation,
or acute myopia, I don't know. But
I don't think the Legion knows the
War is over.

bills. It is only business sense.
The men who stay at home should
have every penny of war profit
tixed right out of their cash-regis
ters. Those who go across should
realize that $1 a day and beans is
their sole remuneration. No bonus
pot at the end of the rainbow.
Everyone would be less anxious for
war. The terrible atrocities become
less, terrible in the absence of boom
ing prices and rising profits. Human
sympathies work that way.
Besides being a constarlt drain on
the treasury and for the second
time a serious embarrassment to
Washington, the veterans have been
ever with us in other ways as well,
Local Legionnaires have attempted
to maintain the 1917 jingoism at its
wartime fervor. They have been ac
tive in attacking "reds" and other
"enemies of the Constitution." In a
world that is forgetting the World
War and its unsophisticated antics,
these men have continually kept
their lips glued to the blatant bugles
of babbitry.
Whether it is emotional fixation,
or acute myopia, I don't know. But
I don't think the Legion knows the
War is over.

THE HEROES OF 1!I17
Another Bonus Army is marching
on Washington. Another ragged
bunch of unemployed who happened
to have worn ill-fitting khaki 16
years ago is collecting in the soup
and bread lines around the national
capitol. The Roosevelt Administra
tion will soon be as embarrassed as
was the Hoover. We hope I hey don't
relieve their embarrassment in the
same way.
Our heroes of The War which
made the country safe and profit
able for New York stock brokers
have been a national problem ever
since. Little did anyone think that
when they marched away to the
tune of the "Stars and Stripes For
ever" they would return singing,
"I've Got You in the Palm of My
Hand." But that is a fact. The
Legion, an organized minority, has
ably decked itself in red, white, and
biue, and persisted in holding the
ciub over Congress. For years we
have been paying money to every
middle-aged veteran who developed
anything from fiat feet to dandruff.
As long as the land flowed with
milk, honey, and increasing divi
dends, that was all well. The people
then who criticized the Legion were
branded as radicals, socialists, if not
actual Soviet agents. Now, however,
with an unbalancable budget, the
spending of millions for the veterans
looks too much like an organized
gouging on a national scale. People
art beginning to feel that all that
shouts is not patriotic.
The big bonus argument is that

while "we soldiers were away hold
ing the enemy from the front door,
the stay-at-homes grew rich nuts in
the back yard and roasted them in
the fireplace." That is true; but un
fortunate. Everybody should have
stayed home and reaped big divi
dends. That was the error. The
profits of war should be absorbed
by the government. They pay the
bills. It is only business sense.
