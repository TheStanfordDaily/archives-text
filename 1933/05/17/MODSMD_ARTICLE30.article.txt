| lIER MAJESTY THE WIDOW—At
the Columbia Theatre.
Thanks to skillful direction and
j good acting, this very trivial play
j furnishes a fair evening's entertain-
I ment. The story is old as the hills:
i
i a very young boy is engaged to a
| very nice girl, falls in love with a
! very voluptious gold-digger, and is
j rtscued by his mother, who of course
! hiis a love interest of her own to
I take care of. And there are the
1 u c .ual complications. Now, if this
j had been treated as a farce it would
j have made a good play, but instead
! it pretends to be a refined comedy.
The whole is extremely pedestrian,
with no brilliant dialogue, and be
, comes amusing) only when farce
tricks are resorted to.
I
But Pauline Frederick has done
far more with this unpromising ma
terial than it deserved. Her acting
was a bit vivacious, but this slight
overplaying was necessary to get
enough action on the stage and
brighten the dull lines. She seemed
to enjoy her part thoroughly, and
managed to communicate this pleas-
I ure to the audience. The same can
be said for the rest of the cast, who
I tried very hard to keep the conven
j tJonal dialogue from sounding too
I stupid, and almost succeeded.
The director managed to maintain
! a'i even and rapid tempo, and did
j hii best to vary the very convefi
\ tional entrances, exits, etc., that the
I play called for. The sets, lighting,
I and costumes might have been bet
j ter. It is a pity that the cast wasted
| their talent and enthusiasm on this
| play. — Zimansky
F.LONDIE JOHNSON (Warner)—
At the Stanford Theatre.
i A gangster tale featuring two stars
quite at home in such roles, Joan
I Blondell and Chester Morris. The
| picture though it features the well
! known underworld theme, is un
; usual in several respects. First, the
woman (Joan Blondell) is the power
j in the racket, and Morris is cast as
the dumb accessory who is loved

by the queen of the underworld.
The ending is also peculiar, in that
both the hero and the heroine go
to jail.
The picture offers a fine chance
for Miss Blondell to be herself, and
she contributes much humor. But
jour ability to assimilate this hard
boiled wit may have been already
tr.xed too much by the myriad of
these gangster stories in the past, j
In general, "Blondie Johnson" is, i
for its type, rather good entertain
ment value. • —Gruenberg
THE MYSTERY OF THE WAX
MUSEUM (Warners) —Recently at
the Menlo Theatre.
"The Mystery of the Wax Mu
seum" does very poorly what its '
avowed predecssor, "Doctor X." did
very welT. It achieves neither the
horror nor the suspense of the
earlier film and succeeds in being
interesting only by Technicolor and 1
by the personalities of the players
rr.ther than the merit of their opus.
The mystery is uncommonly neb
ulous; the denouement solves only
what one has suspected all along
and leaves unmentioned all the ma
jor loopholes.
Lionel Atwill is the dominating
figure, a wax sculptor whose hands j
have been burned—along with his
wax creations —in a horrible fire.
Hi j devious methods of restoring
these figures comprise the latter half
of the film, which is a maze of ob
scurities.
The players are all excellent, and
ii" it is difficult to imagine Glenda
Farrell as the Lep Tracy type of
news-hound it is no fault of hers.
Frank McHugh is the inevitable
managing editor who, oddly enough,
asks her to marry him. Her reply
is characteristic: "I'll get even with

ya, ya big stiff; I'll do it." (Fade
-1 out.)
I feared for awhile that we should
have no screaming from that scream
genius, Fay Wray, but the prospect
of a good wax tubbing brought
! forth a fine vocal performance from
I her. —Chapin
