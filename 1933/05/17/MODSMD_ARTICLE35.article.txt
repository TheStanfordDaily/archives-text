NEW YORK—Mrs. Frances E.
Spence has filed suit in the Supreme
Court, seeking to restrain Metro-
Goldwyn-Mayer Distributing Cor
poration from further showing a
film which depicts her standing at
the bar in "Sloppy Joe's" saloon in
Havana, Cuba.
She asks damages of $50,000. Mrs.
Spence alleged that she did not
know the film had been made until
friends saw it shown. On seeing it
herself at a theatre, she said she
found herself "drinking and looking
as if I had taken too many."
