110 hum, gotta sit down and fill
up a column .... They say it's
hard when there ain't nothing to
si y, but as long as there are thou
sands of words in the dictionary,
ought a be able to sling a couple
hundred together .... Wonder how
fast Sam Eastman ran down at
Fresno . . . unofficial watches caught
him in everything from 1:57 to 2-flat.
.... Sammy says it felt fast, but
he wasn't "out" at the end
And Robinson of Fresno State ran
1:54 plus before the home folks—
iht fastest on the Coast this year.
.... Our beloved Garry Breckner
announced Robinson as McQuiddie,
aad McQuiddie's father sent him a
t< legram of congratulation after
hearing Breckner's usual evening
misstatement Berk Anthony,
Phi P.si mural basketball star, went
and got married .... Harriette Carr
i the new Mrs. Anthony, and the
Men's Rest Home has lost a good
part of its appeal .... But cheerful
Mrs. Carr is still there .... Jeff
Minckler dittoed Berk's feat ....
No more letters from Dona ad
dressee' to the Theta Delt house ....
II Jeff comes back to school, Tiny
will have one more good enel ....
Gordie Graves is the . new water
polo captain .... And he's also
President of Circle S . . . . And the
swimmers will address Ted Wiget
as "der captink" next year ....
Wonder how Gus Meier received
the nickname "Clark Gable" ....
Or do I wonder? .... Sammy Lee
rather than Chuck Otis is going back
East with Joe Coughlin because
Sammy plays better doubles than
Chuck .... And Sammy and Joe
should be about the best in the
U.S Don't know what Stanford
will do for a polo coach with Dick
Gordon leaving .... Dick has
turned out the best collegiate teams
on the Coast for years .... Yale
and Arizona alone throughout the
country compare with the Cards . . ..
Jay Graves gave Don Edwards his
name "The Enthusiastic" .... And
Jay is more enthusiastic about Ed
wards than Don is about golf ....
Did you know that John Bunn is a
full-Hedged Cherokee Indian? ....
Well, he's not Rudy Gonzalez
ii the most-improved soccer player
ii the world .... But he has to
beat Dave Dunning, Johnny Hitch
cock, and Ralph Cotter out of that |
light-half job .... And they all
have improved too .... incidentally,
the odds on the juniors in inter
class soccer are down to 1 to 5
Dink Templeton has sent South for
the pictures of the Hables-Ball .
finish .... That track meet will be \
good for news till the Daily type

writers fall to pieces .... Which
should be in about another three
seconds. ' —Dick Strouse
