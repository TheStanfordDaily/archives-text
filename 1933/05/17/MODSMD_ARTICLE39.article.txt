Rallying to overcome a two-run

Delta Upsilon, 6 to 5, yesterday in
the only soft ball game to win the
right to enter the semi-finals.
Sequioa Wins
In the only hard ball game of
the day, Sequoia II drubbed â€¢ El
Cuadro, 11 to 2. The Alpha Tau
Omega-Theta Xi soft ball game,
originally scheduled for yesterday,
will be played today, the winner
entering the finals and the Alpha
Sigma Phi-Theta Chi hard ball
was also postponed until later in
the week.
After Kappa Alpha had taken an
early lead in yesterday's game,
Delta Upsilon went on a hitting
spree which netted them five runs
and apparently put the game in the
D.U. bag. In the seventh inning,
Card and Byrne of K.A. hit, and
both scored on Jurs'.safety, and in
the extra frame. Card drove Mc-
Comish home with the winning tally.
Daniels on Mound
Gordon Daniels, on the mound for
Sequoia I, turned in an outstanding
pitching performance, limiting El
Cuadro to one hit and fanning ten.
The hallmen put the game on ice,
after Cuadro had scored twice in
the opening inning, when they
counted five runs in the third frame
and another quintet of scores in the
fourth. White's home run in deep
center with two men on base ac
counted for three Sequoia runs.
California's football star, Dave
Meek, registered for the shot put
and in six weeks of training in
creased his distance from 45 feet to
48:11%.
