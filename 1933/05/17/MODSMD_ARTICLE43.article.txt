# STANFORD, S.C., MICHIGAN SEEN AS I.C.-4A VICTORS
## 
### ALBERT GUERARD 
Once again Far Western teams in
the 1.C.4-A. meet May 26 and 27
will have to search within their
own ranks for the calibre of com
petition that breaks records.
Michigan University, Alma Mater
oi many glorious trackmen in the
past, has produced another strong
team. The Wolverines may finish
third, above Harvard, Yale, anel
their ilk—but Stanford and the Uni
versity of Southern California are
certain to divide first- and second
place honors between them, as has
been their custom for nearly a dec
ade.
Michigan's ace athlete is Willis
Ward, ranked with Walter Marty
and George Spitz as the best Ameri
can high-jumper (notwithstanding
the Olympic Games performances
o! U.S.C.'s Duncan McNaughton and
Bob Von Osdel, and Cornelius John
son of Los Angeles High School).
Ward has also run 100 yards in
9.7, and the high hurdles in 14.6
seconds, not to mention sundry ef

forts at the 220, low hurdles, broad
jump, and discus. Michigan will also
bring a 4:20 miler in Howell, a 23.6
low hurdler in Eggelson, Olympic
veteran Edward Turner in the 880,
Cox (162 feet in the hammer throw'),
and Charles de Baker, a 48-second
quarter-miler.
All of which should be good for
18 to 22 points, or fourth place.
Strong running material, headed
by a second Bill Carr in Howard
Jones, may give Pennsylvania the
third place, though Harvard, Dart
mouth, Yale, Princeton, Columbia,
and Cornell will be strong contend
ers. The latter team has several
veiy good stars, but little place ma
terial. Wernt, javelin, and Hardy,
100 and 220, hope to win their events,
though Mottram and Hables of
Stanford expect to destroy their
he pes.
