# CARD ALUMNUS WINS LITERARY PULITZER PRIZE
## 
### 
When the English Club published
a slim book of verse 17 years ago,
there was probably little thought
that the writing of slim bespectacled
graduate-student Maxwell Anderson
would some day be recognized by a
Pulitzer Prize.
"What Price CÂ»lory"
Bul a half-dozen years after this
publication it was the same Maxwell
Anderson, writing with Laurance
Stallings, who shocked the world
with the frank and bitter "What
Price Glory," the first of that long
si ries of plays about the World

War. It was acted all over the world,
and novelized.
And now, with a savage political
drama, '"Both Your Houses," Ander
son has finally been awarded the
Pulitzer Prize. "Both Your Houses,"
first produced two months ago,
aioused a storm of controversy, but
ci itics agreed that it was a real and
stimulating performance.
Between these two plays have
been a notable series of dramas,
some good, some bad, but all vigor
ous. With Laurence Stallings he
wrote two other plays, "The Buca
i.ccr" and "First Flight," both short
lived historical dramas.
These were followed by "Outside

Looking In," written in collabora
tion with Jim Tully. With Harold
Hiekerson, Anderson wrote another
political drama, "Gods of the Light
ning," inspired by the Sacco-Van
zetti case.
Dramaiir Triumphs
But it has been with plays writ
ten without collaborators th.it An
derson has made for himself the
important place he holds in Ameri
can dramatic literature. "Elizabeth
the Queen," "Saturday's Children,"
and "Gypsy," all found high praise.
Last year productions of "Night
Over Taos," a picture of the gallant
l;st stand ot the Spanish in New
Mexico, and "The Sea Wife," a
weird, fanciful drama, proved An
dersons versatility further.
Now, recognized as one of Amer
ica's chief dramatists, Anderson
spends his time between Hollywood
;nd New York, writing for the
cinema with, it may be believed,
happily remunerative results. And
writing for the theatre with increas
ing artistry.
