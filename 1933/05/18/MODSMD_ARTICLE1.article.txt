# STANFORD IC-4A SQUAD LIMITED TO 14 BY B.A.C.
## List of Men Making Trip Not To Be Revealed Until Saturday DINK FACES DILEMMA Slashed Budget Necessitates Reduction Of Squad 
### Spud Hamilton 
Saturday night sixteen Stanford
men will hit the road to Boston and
the I.C.A.A.A.A. meet. Coach Dink
Templeton and Manager Tony
Fianich of the track .squad will be
two of those men, but the remainder
of 14 active athletes is a matter of
conjecture today, and a matter of
conjecture it will remain right up
until train time.
Coach Templeton finds himself
in an awkward situation. Willi fif
teen men on the squad who are
potential point-winners in na
tional competition, the B.A.C. has
issued orders that expenses must
he pared, and so the fifteen must
ii. some way he reduced to four
teen. Which all means that some
hard-working kid who has had his
eyes' on Boston all season and who
has the stuff to earn his points
there, must stay at home and feed
the cat.
It would be a downright crime
to break up those four bunchy
muscled behemoths, the heavy
weight quartet, the beef trust, in
other words, weightmen Dunn, Gray,
Laborde, and Lyman.
Hables?
And Les "Hard Luck" Hables must
certainly be counted on, as well as
hurdlers Cotto Herbert and Gus
Meier. All are agreed that Johnny
Mottram deserves a chance to tear
up the turf on Boston Commons
practicing with his javelin. (Catch

i >: if we're wrong on that—someone
suggested maybe they ain't no turf
on Boston Commons).
Bill Miller is coming along fast,
despite his heel injury. Both he and
Deacon ought lo be in top form by
May 27. These lads are capable of
11 fort or bettor. Phil Williams and
Paul Zaches have both shown plenty
< I stuff; they can't be counted out
without a struggle.
Who to Omit?
And maybe you've heard of Lloyd
Schween, who nipped El Trojan
where it hurt the most, and went
(> feet 4 :! k inches. A1 Blackman is at
his best this last week and hit 4{)
(liit twice. Outside of Ben Eastman,
that's the best time ever run on
Angell Field. And Johnny Morrison,
Bud Spencer, and a few others who
were considered better than fair to
ir.iddlin' quarter-milers have prac
ticed on that oval.
Did we leave someone out? Oh
yeah, Captain Ben Eastman insists
that he go along to see that the boys
don't tip over any banana wagons.
That adds up to fifteen men,
which is one too many, says the
IJ.A.C. No wonder these track
coaches have a far-away look and
niumhle to themselves.

Bud Spencer, and a few others who
were considered better than fair to
ir.iddlin' quarter-milers have prac
ticed on that oval.
Did we leave someone out? Oh
yeah, Captain Ben Eastman insists
that he go along to see that the boys
don't tip over any banana wagons.
That adds up to fifteen men,
which is one too many, says the
IJ.A.C. No wonder these track
coaches have a far-away look and
niumhle to themselves.
Saturday night sixteen Stanford
men will hit the road to Boston and
the I.C.A.A.A.A. meet. Coach Dink
Templeton and Manager Tony
Fianich of the track .squad will be
two of those men, but the remainder
of 14 active athletes is a matter of
conjecture today, and a matter of
conjecture it will remain right up
until train time.
Coach Templeton finds himself
in an awkward situation. Willi fif
teen men on the squad who are
potential point-winners in na
tional competition, the B.A.C. has
issued orders that expenses must
he pared, and so the fifteen must
ii. some way he reduced to four
teen. Which all means that some
hard-working kid who has had his
eyes' on Boston all season and who
has the stuff to earn his points
there, must stay at home and feed
the cat.
It would be a downright crime
to break up those four bunchy
muscled behemoths, the heavy
weight quartet, the beef trust, in
other words, weightmen Dunn, Gray,
Laborde, and Lyman.
Hables?
And Les "Hard Luck" Hables must
certainly be counted on, as well as
hurdlers Cotto Herbert and Gus
Meier. All are agreed that Johnny
Mottram deserves a chance to tear
up the turf on Boston Commons
practicing with his javelin. (Catch

suggested maybe they ain't no turf
on Boston Commons).
Bill Miller is coming along fast,
despite his heel injury. Both he and
Deacon ought lo be in top form by
May 27. These lads are capable of
11 fort or bettor. Phil Williams and
Paul Zaches have both shown plenty
< I stuff; they can't be counted out
without a struggle.
Who to Omit?
And maybe you've heard of Lloyd
Schween, who nipped El Trojan
where it hurt the most, and went
