Stressing the fact that the Hall
Caucus was not to be considered as
an opening wedge in a Hall-Kow

speeches by the presidential candi
dates.
Glib-tongued Wayne Bannister
opened the presidential nominations
bringing Huneke's name before the
caucus. John Skog, thick-jawed
leader from Sequoia, placed San
derson's name on the caucus ballots.
