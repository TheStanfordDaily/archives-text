# Bonus Marchers Reject Offer Of Forest Jobs
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 17 (JP)
With but a few dissenting votes
that were scarcely audible, the
bonus marchers' convention today
rejected the administration's offer
of jobs in the forests.
The offer had been made to a
committee of the J 200' veterans in
the capital to demand immediate
payment of the bonus, by Louis M.
Howe, one of the president's sec re- j
tsries.
A committee immediately drafted
a resolution to reject the offer and
it was carried amid tumultuous!
cheering and stamping of feet.
The men then left the convention '
hall at the Washington auditorium j
and partook of sandwiches and cof- j
fee sent down from Fort Hunt, Va., |
where the government is providing
free shelter and food during their
stay.
