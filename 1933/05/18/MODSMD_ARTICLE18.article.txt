# Hall Caucus Featured By Speeches, Smoke, Boos

### Dave Mellinkoff 
In the smoke-laden atmosphere
ol" a political convention, Stanford
hallmen brandishing half-lit Pana
lellas, last night filled out the ticket
which may carry the hall standard
lo the president's office in the forth
coming campus embroglio.
Demonstrating remarkable politi
cal perspicacity, the crowds which
filled the Toyon Lobby booed lustily
at the nominator who declared that
his candidate "had no enemies."
Cheers (of the Bronx and Stan
ford type) greeted the man who, a
speaker declared, is "well known by
all the fellows that know him."
The bright-light of the pre-presi

laration for Mary Louise Stewart
that "for the first lime in a long
time, there's been a woman in Roble

last-minute votes, Toyon's Bannister
and Sequoia's John B. Skog placed
in nomination the names of lanky,

tousle-haired Herb Sanderson.
But all was not over. Lone wolves
from the classes of '24 and '25 â€”
' political warriors of another day
| demanded that they be heard. And
they spoke: a boost, for Sanderson
and a parting shot for Huneke.
Then, for the first time in caucus
history, popular demand from the
floor brought short rally talks from
each of the presidential candidates.
As usual, party harmony was the
keynote of the caucus.
