### 
Appearing four days ahead of
schedule, the 1933 Quad will be
ready for distribution on the cam
pus June 1, announced Hay Hansen,
editor, last night. Fifteen hundred
copies will be on the campus at that
lime, of which 1400 have been re
served.
The covers for the Quad have ar
rived from Chicago, and several
sections are already off ihe press.
These sections have received much
favorable comment as they are con
sidered better than those of last
year.
New features will include an in
crease of eight pages over last year's
life section, and a complete index of
all names appearing in the Quad —
the first time in the history of the
yearbook that an index has been
included. The Quad will contain the
same number of pages as last year—
464 pages.
