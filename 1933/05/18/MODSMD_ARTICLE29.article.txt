# The 						Polo Team Loses a Good Coach As Captain Gordan Leaves the Farm
## 
### 
Those galloping Rcdshirts of the Farm's have appar
ently been tossed tor a nasty spill. When Captain Dick
(lonian was suddenly transferred to Roosevelt's Gonser
vation Army, il left a tjood polo team without a still better
eoaeb. The Stanford riders will han t i> up their spurs for the
rest of the quarter, for all remaining practices and Raines
have been canceled.
The immediate loss is little compared to that which
polo may suffer next fall. While the R.0.T.C.. department
is hoping that (Jordan's stay at Stanford will be resumed
again next fall, il is quite possible that the present tem
porary assignment may either be extended, or that he may
be permanently transferred, lie has already staved an
extra year over the four which the War Department says
shall be the length of stay of an officer at one post.
(Jordan was chosen for the Army Olympic team in I!)2<S
and last year. This is a recognition of horsemanship
handed to only seven men in the whole Army, lie has
graduated from the French Cavalry School at Xaniur,
where only the cream of the Army's riders are sent, l iider
(Jordan's guidance, a polo team has been developed at
Stanford that, next to Arizona, ranks as the best collegiate
four in the West.
It's a preth tonsil break, all rii>lit; but war and polo
don't alw avs mix.
