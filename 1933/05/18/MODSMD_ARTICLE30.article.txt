With ;i yearni 1114 love for Hie hard coin thai is under
standable in I hose barren years, members of t lie latest
bonus marchers' convention have rejected the administra
tion's oiler of jobs in Roosevelt's "forest army" and have
again demanded cash payment of their bonus certificates.
While in Washington, the veterans have been fed and
housed by the government. Last year they were welcomed
with the bayonet and the torch. The attitude of the admin
istration toward the former soldiers has changed, but not
their attitude toward the administration.
Fifteen years ago, tlx 1 khaki-clad A.K.F. trained the
sights of their I'.HW Springtields over trench walls at the
enemy. Today, their rifles are still at their shoulders, bill
their target has become the American tax-paver.
