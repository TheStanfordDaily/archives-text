Starting today the DAii.y will print as a regular daily
feature a list of jobs available for students. The service is
furnished by the Student Appointment Oftice and will con
sist of jobs listed with the secretary for the current day.
I've 11 in these times, Mrs. Irene Spenner. the secretary,
manages to corral a good many local odd jobs, but most
of them are snapped up by those who follow the service
regularly. Hy giving the lists publicity it is hoped that
more needy students will be aided by a larger spread of
work.
