THE LOWERING WHICH IS NO LOWERING

The number of recommended units j
for admission has been lowered but
that is far different from stating that
the entrance requirements have
been cut. On the face of it, that
sounds like an administrative apolo
gia, a perfect paradox, and a lurid
attempt to say that the patches in
the University trousers are not
patches at all—merely pieces of cloth
sowed on the trousers to cover up
the holes.

But that is only because the grade
mania has become such an all
common form of insanity for so long :
that whqn normalcy does break 1
out, it is immediately set down as
rabid lunacy. We have been accus
tomed to measuring everything, in
cluding intelligence, by grades. And
when the educational order has 1
f t lion so low that measuring intelli
gence by grades is accepted, it is
obvious how far along the grade
mania has advanced.
The University will not allow a '
few "C'.s" to block one's entrance
to Stanford. Instead, they will open
ov shut (he gates on a more basic
consideration — intelligence test
scores. The personal ratings are
splendid. For the simple reason that
cne always gets people to make out
these blanks upon whose keen un
derstanding, discrimination, and
above all, upon whose personal sym
pathetic bias one can ever depend.
But the aptitude test rating is j
something that is reliable. A fairly
industrious high-class moron can go
through high school with "B"
grades; and in some high schools in j

the backwoods he probably doesn't
have to be so very high class either.
To admit students with those grades
against others who haven't the "B's"
is an injustice to the University.
There are many men (and women,
too, I suppose) who would make
splendid college material who are
shunted off into junior colleges for
a bit of excusable laziness in their
freshman year at high school.
To condemn these people to jun
ior college or almost as bad, to a
second-rate college, for this youth
ful indiscretion, is criminal. This
will be prevented under the new
plan.
Many people have cast an odium
over the Terman intelligence tests—
Walter Lippman, I believe, being one
of the most flent opponents. While
it is true that they cannot measure
minute differences —a casual obser
vation around the Farm will show
its remarkable accuracy generally.
It must be admitted, however, they
cannot measure "true" intelligence
unadulterated by experience; but
that is no bar, as the kind of intelli
gence does not exist in any place
except the psychology textbooks.

The only cause for suspicion that
the new plans reveal is that they
come when the University is ad
mittedly scratching around Tor stu
dents. But the depression has caused
many new ideas. When times were
good, there was no excuse or in
centive to chance. And while during
depression there may be a tendency
to change too much, the present
alteration is a jump (though pretty
small) to the goal labeled: "No
dodos; no bustles; no grades."
