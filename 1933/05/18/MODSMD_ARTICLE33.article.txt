JOSEPHUS—By Lion Feuchtawnger.
(At the Gordon Strawbridge Li
brary in the Cellar.)
I This German author has given us
j ether fine historical novels, btit none
; en so large a scale, ror any so skill—
j fully written as Joseph us.
j Whereas in Jud Suss there was j
too much and too morbid a realism,
i and in the Ugly Duchess too flam
es j
boyant realism, in Josephus the ele
i n>rnt is still present, none the less
. accurately or shrewdly dramatized,
but made a medium through which
! his pictures shine more vividly—
I rether than an end in itself.
Josephus, a young Judean emis- 1
j sary, comes to Rome during the
height of its power to plead before
' the Emperor Nero for the lives of
three of his countrymen. There are
begun the events which lead to the
wars between the Jews and the
' Romans, through which is traced
i the career of mysterious Josephus
j in Rome, Galilee, Alexandria, and
! Jerusalem.
Feuchtwanger presents the luxury
J arid color of the mighty Roman cm
! pire with an almost theatrical se-
I lection of material, yet with always
itiuthful, sometimes unpleasant, de
-1 tail. There is, however, no morbid
' r css; if, in his determination to be
j reai, the author escapes the roman-
I tic glamor of Brother Saul, he does
| picture a turbtilent glory in keeping
! v.-ith the times.

The plot is exciting enough to
carry Feuchtwanger's prose, which
is apt to become a bit heavy. Though
orie is reading history, the charac
ters are so convincing that it seems
cne is watching very real persons
living very real lives; and the time
<nd place are a background made
surprisingly familiar by the vivid
ness of the presentation.
