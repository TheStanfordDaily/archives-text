The Editor, Sir:
The much-investigated and un- I
repentant Stanford Bookstore con- j
tinues to grow in popularity among j
Stanford students.
The patriarchs of the little brown !
store in their infinite wisdom have
deemed it wholly unnecessary—in !
fact, undesirable—to institute any ;
real economies in store management. |
In answer to requests for change,
they declare it "against our policy" j
to do anything. In attempting to ex- j
plain their policy, they have worked )
under the theory: "What the stu- \
dents dont's know, won't hurt them."
Now either in a spirit of petty i
economy or puerile revenge, they
have slashed from their staggering 1
budget the provision for INK IN
THE RESERVE BOOK READING
ROOM of the library. Reserve book 1
leading room ink has always been
notoriously poor ink, but at least
the absence oi rebates was partially
m;.de up for by thh- presence of a j
re;; 1 convenience, almost a neces
sity. The reading room without ink
is almost as bad as Palo Alto with
out beer.
It is to be hoped that the Senior j
Class, a charitable alumnus, or the
Associated Students will re-ink the
leading room, even though that ac
tion smears a blue-black blot across j
the fair name of the Stanford Book
store. Sincerely yours,
Gordon Pollock, '30 j
