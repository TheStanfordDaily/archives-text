Gene Beatty of Michigan State Nor
mal won the 400-meter hurdles in
the Penn Relays for the third suc-
time on May 1. Bob Jackson,
Lt--high's sophomore star, nearly
nipped Beatty at the tape. Said the
Detroit News anent the close finish:
' it is quite likely that Beatty felt
the loss of one of his most con
sistent rivals more than anything
el.c. For Ihe fir*;l time in the Penn
Relays, he was running alone, with
( u( Kenneth Simmons, his teammate
and close lriend Simmons,
j.ierry and irrepressible, a red
l.< a.ded boy with flaming competi
tive spirit, had the push necessary
t i extend Beatty, and he was not in
this race."
Beatty once starred as a high
school athlete at Northwestern Uni
vt rsity's indoor interscholastics. On
v; l ions occasions, he won the 440-
yard clash, the highs, the lows, the
f HO, and placed in the high-jump.
In mo dusky Gene was high
j.'oinl man of the meet for the
Jliird successive year, winning the
lows and placing in the highs and
clash. The great silver loving-cup
v\as ceremoniously given to Beatty
snnid applause.
And some months later Beatty was
asked by the Northwestern commit
ii e to return the cup. For, informa
tion concerning the bald negro's age
and marital relationship caused the
University to disqualify him.
