# Seniors Forfeit Soccer Game To Junior Team
## FIVE INELIGIBLES IN 1933 LINEUP AS 0-0 TIE PLAYED 
### 
Lowering the 5-1 odds for the
j uidor class soccer team to win
the interclass contest, the juniors
won I'roin the seniors yesterday
afternoon through a forfeit after
Â« 0-0 game in which the seniors
played live lion-senior men.
Odds for the juniors dropped to
about 2 to 1 when, even given an
extra period, they failed to score.
Li ck of scoring power can not be
laid to the absence of Rod Lewis,
fullback, or Art Hearn, forward, as
the juniors' powerful forward was
composed of five outstanding varsity
payers, including Varsity Captain
Carl Knecht, all-Conference forward
wing for 1932.
Corner Kicks Aid
Two corner kicks for the juniors
and much play in the area of the
senior goal during the first part of
the game gave the juniors a good
appearance. From the middle of the
first half the game was pretty even,
if it didn't lean in favor of the
seniors. Judging from the excellent
play demanded from junior goalie
Jack King the seniors had more
than their share of goal shots.
Captain Johnson Stars
For ihe juniors, Cy Johnson, cajo
t; in; Alberto Navarro, right inside;
King, goalie; and Carl Knecht, left
v.ing, were outstanding.
Seniors Holmes, center half; Carl
Breckelbaum, fullback; and Dana
Detrick, right wing, were the strong
points of that team. Miguel Gomez,
sophomore center forward, and
Wciddy White, sophomore left half,
piayed good games. Both will play
against the freshmen today when
the sophomore team, captained by
Doug Kennedy, locks horns with the
fieshmen, led by Louis Bansbach.
