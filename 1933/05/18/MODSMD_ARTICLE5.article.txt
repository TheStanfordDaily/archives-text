## 
### 
Lobby methods of furthering the i
; Anti-Vivisection bill, which was de
| fcated last Saturday in the State
i Assembly, were revealed last night j
!by Dean McHenry, graduate stu
j dent in Political Science, at a meet-
I ing of the League for Industrial
] Democracy.
Post cards were distributed over
1 the state bearing under the inserip
' lion, "Humane Dog Pound Bill," a j
picture of 10 beautiful dogs and the
I pica, "If you can't give me a good j
! home give me at least a painless i
| death." These cards poured in by â– 
; the thousands, first on the senators !
! en the committee, and then on all j
' the. senators. The bill passed the ,
| Senate but was defeated in the As
isembly, largely thorugh the efforts
! of Assemblyman Crist of Palo Alto, |
j a Stanford graduate, McHenry said. ;
: It passed, thi.s measure would have
j meant a great curtailment of the re
| scarch activities of the Medical |
! School.
