day afternoon.
Miller of the Alpha Tau Omegas
pulled his team out of many tight
spots with his fine pitching. During
the course of the afternoon Miller
struck out a total of ten men. He
was supported by strong hitting and
good fielding, seldom evident in
mural games.

was outstanding for his team. He
struck out nearly as many men as
his opponent, but lacked the support
from his teammates.
