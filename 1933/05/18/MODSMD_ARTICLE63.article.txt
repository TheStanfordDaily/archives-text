Diego Rivera (left), foremost Mexican artist, was dismissed as one of the painters whose huge murals were to decorate the great hall
cf the new 70-story building of Rockefeller center in New York. He was called from his scaffold and given a check for $14,000 in full
payment of his contract. The principal objection to his work was a likeness of Lenin which appeared in one of the panels. He had refused
a request by Nelson Rockefeller (inset below), son of John D. Rockefeller, jr., that the face of an unknown man be substituted for that of
Lenin. The portion of the picture about which the disoute centered is shown at the right. (Associated Press Photos)
