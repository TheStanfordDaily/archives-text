# Wilbur Installs '500' Leaders
## Jeanne Millard Inducted As New Women's Chief 
### 
Stressing the responsibility of the
present "500"' toward the new wo
men entering next year, President
Ray Lyman Wilbur installed the
new A.W.S. officers Ja.st night at the
annual A.W.S. installation, banquet.
He said, "Certain customs, ideals,
j plans, have grown up on this cam
pus and they are bound to shift.
Can we keep in the Stanford women
i the spirit of cohesion which has
j been so apparent in the past year?"
Wilbur emphasized the fact that
the idea of getting rid of the "500"
j limit is not new, but was presented
to him upon his arrival. The num
i ber of women to be admitted in the
near future is to be limited only by
board and room facilities. Climaxing
his half-joking, half-serious instal
lation, President Wilbur expressed
the desire that the spirit of Stanford |
be kept the same no matter what
changes might take place.
Following Wilbur's address, Mary-
Kay Morris, the outgoing A.W.S.
head, and Jeanne Millard, president
elect, made short speeches. Professor i
Edgar E. Robinson spoke briefly on j
the freedom and responsibility of!
Stanford women.
