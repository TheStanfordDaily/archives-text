# Alpha Phi Mock Fire Stirs Row

### 
.
1 Screaming fire engines roaring up j
the Row. Roughs dashing madly after
to see the sight of their livesâ€”a real j
sorority house fire. Destination: the
j abode of the Alpha Phi's.
Dismayed and disappointed roughs.
All the Alpha Phi's, fully clad, won
dering themselves what had hap
pened.
"An explosion," they yelp.
"Where," says the fireman. "There's
a smell from the basement," they
retort. Down into the cellar plunges
the fire laddie. "Doesn't it always
smell this way?" he queries.
