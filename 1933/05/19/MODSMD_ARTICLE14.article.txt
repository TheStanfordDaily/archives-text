# HITLER'S STAND FURTHERS HOPE FOR ARMS CUT
## Geneva Praises F.R.'s Bold Plea To World Nations For Disarmament 
### 
GENEVA, May 18 of j
the leading nations hastened to re- |
turn to Geneva tonight for the |
hopeful resumption tomorrow of ef
forts to break the disarmament
deadlock in the light of pronounce
ments by President Roosevelt and ;
Chancellor Hitler of Germany.
The bold initiative of the Ameri- j
can President in appealing directly
to heads of states for immediate ac
tion to secure political peace and
open the way for economic recovery j
welcomed here as opening the j
door to possible agreement for a i
genuine reduction of lighting wea- j
pons.
Optimism Prevalent
The conciliatory pronouncement
by the Nazi Chancellor coming
immediately after the message j
from Washington increased a feel- j
ing of optimism that the arms
conference now is facing another
great opportunity to reach its
long-awaited objective.
Norman H. Davis, fresh from con- j
versations with the heads of states'
at London and at Paris, was looked i
to by other chief delegates for an
elucidation upon the new policy of
the Washington Government with I
regard to participating in an inter- j
national guarantee of security!
against an aggressor.
