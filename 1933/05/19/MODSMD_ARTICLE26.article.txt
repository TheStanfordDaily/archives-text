# Not a Whale of a Difference In Fourteen or Fifteen in Boston
## 
### 
What .-hi insignificant atom the individual man. Hut ;
what a difference it makes when that man can run, jump,
or throw things faster, higher, or turther than 11 is average |
fellowinan, especially it the so-gifted individual goes to
college.
There seems to he a lot of dissalislaction on the Stan-
Cord campus today because the Hoard ol Athletic Control
has decided to take fourteen rather Hum fifteen athletes to j
the Inlereollegiates at Boston. Looking optimistically tor
ward to the annual college track and field classic, it seems
that Stanford actually lias an excellent chance to annex
the national title. The 8.A.C., of course, wants to bring that j
title to the f arm, and tliev figure that a representation ol j
fourteen men will turn the trick, if the trick is in the cards. I
Hut a group of track and field athletes are like unto so j
many race-horses. Any one or any six of them are apt to j
pull a muscle, a tendon, or something. Fourteen Indian j
trackmen of super-varsity caliber should have just as much !
chance to bring the beans home from Boston as would have j
fifteen, or twenty, t ndoubtedly, the 8.A.C., which makes a :
business of collegiate athletics, knows that business better,
than a group of student supporters who know tlfe men on
their own team, but who, for the most part, are unfamiliar!
with the limes, heights, weights, and distances which will I
be necessary to win points in a given intercollegiate meet. I
The B.A.C. would probably like to give every man on j
the squad a trip to Boston in reward for his effort and en-!
thusiasm, were it not for the spectral dollar sign. And per-j
haps Stanford would win the 1.C.1-A. with a team of!
twenty-five men. Then again, Stanford might lose. And
what if Stanford ,should lose with fourteen? The whole ;
trip is a gamble, no matter how many men take it, and it's i
better, if the 8.A.C,. thinks so, to gamble with fourteen men
than to spend money it doesn't have in making a stronger
and more expensive bid.
