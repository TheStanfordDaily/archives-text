# Judge Springer Againâ€” This Time in a Curiously Minor Role
## 
### 
A recoil I incident brought to the atcntion of the Daily I
has recalled .fudge Springer of the Palo Alto judiciary to |
its attention.
Much criticism, in large part unfavorable, has been di-j
reeled against the local town's traffic campaign. Merchants i
have claimed the undulv severe enforcement of parking!
and speeding ordinances has caused peninsula motorists i
to avoid Palo Alto, .fudge Springer, due to his position, has;
received a share of the criticism.
Recently a motorist claiming to be a Stanford student
was arrested for speeding on the Kmbarcadero. His hear-;
ing was scheduled for yesterday. Hut through his attorney,
defendant asked for a trial in San Jose what law grads
call a "change of venue." Apparently he hoped to secure!
what he thought would be a fairer trial.
He appeared in Justice Hrandon Miller's court, and was)
tilled .s2.:">(). Following him all Ihe way to San Jose was
Palo Alto's prosecuting attorney.
What lies behind all this maneuvering is not clear. The
alleged student is out the cost of his attorney; he probably j
had some reason for engaging a lawyer to defend him on
a speeding charge. The city of Palo Alio is out Ihe time!
and expense of sending ils prosecuting attorney down to j
San Jose.
There must be some sufficient cause behind Ihe farce, i
On the surface, both Ihe alleged student and Judge j
Springer have come out on the short end one in his
pockelbook, Ihe oilier in his reputation. Something lurks
behind all this Iml what? The Daily is curious.
