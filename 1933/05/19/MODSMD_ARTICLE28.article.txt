# Are Grades a Necessary Part Of the Modern Educational System?

### 
The recent change made in Stanford's admission re
quirements brings to mind a question which has, for the
past few years, become increasingly important in the minds
of the leaders of educational improvements. Are grades a
necessary part of a modern educational system?
President Robert M. llutchins of the I'niversity of Chi
i ago, a h â€¢ader in his iield, has instituted a gradeless system
at his school, lie declares that the only utility for grades
at Chicago is"for transfer purposes in accommodation to
other institutions which are not as enlightened as we are."
lie further slates that he would admit anyone to the
university, if he had his way, on the simple requirement
that the student could read, write, and was recommended
by a reputable person, lie believes that the necessity for
grades will completely disappear in the next few years.
Many join Dr. llutchins in this belief but few are willing
to go as far as he has at the present time. The feeling that
the grade system is fallacious and unfair is increasing
rapidly and some better means is bound to be found and
instituted shortly.
Why should not Stanford, noted for its educational pro
gressiveness, be among the first of the "Western universities
to take the step?
