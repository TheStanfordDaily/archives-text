# BULL SESSION

### ABE MELLINKOFF 
j Having alumni returning to the
Campus is not so unusual. They of
] ten come back to sit in fraternity
! parlors and get together with the
1 "boys" before the Big Game. To
have them return to sip a little from
i the cup of learning is indeed un
usual. Unusual not by the nature of
things but by the way things hap
; pen. It all begins with the diploma—
a fairly innocuous looking piece of (
i paper.
i
This document .spells finis to the
educational life of the college man.
j He reasons that for four years he
has been getting an education; now
it is all over. And to prove Ihat it
'is all over, he can produce his
diploma. It is as convincing as the
production of the driver's license to
i the cop on the running board. It
proves it. What it is is not quite so
| clear.
i
1 The graduate has the idea that,
j having mastered the academic world
; during his four years, all that is |
now necessary is to go out and get a
job; and settle down to that job—a
Saturday Evening Post— and a fam
ily. It is all as simple as that—un
fortunately. It is staggering to find .
I a successful graduate who has re
ceived a new idea (outside of his
business) since he donned his cap
and gown to receive his diploma. In
I fact, he usually slips a little. The
j "realities" of beating the wolf to
I the door and the "practicalities" of
! his business associates usually stifle
' what little spark the four years may
have engendei'ed.
And so the average graduate j

smug in the realization that he is
educated, settles down to his mucl
puddle existence. When you are fin
ished, you stop. He is finished and
his certificate of completion, his
diploma, hangs ever on the wall as
tangible proof of termination if he
should doubt his own certainty.
To suggest that he return to a
university for MORE education is a
thunderbolt—which rocks and ques
tions his own conviction that he is
done and is a direct challenge to
the sheepskin. Yet that is what is
happening on this Campus Sunday.
Some alumni are returning to par
ticipate in round-table discussions
with leading professors. The sub
jects include the more interesting
and conflicting modern problems.
The professors who are gving up
their time are to be complimented.
This is just a beginning. The first
attack on -4he sanctity of the di
ploma. May the battle continue.
When times get better it may be
possible to extend this post-gradua
tion education. Reading lists on all
subjects should be made available
to alumni at a small fee—not the
traditional lists which can only be
read by sophomores who have to in
order to pass an exam; but spritely
reading that would appeal to the
dilettante, or worse.
Some day the diploma will be
abolished entirely. People will not
feel that four years is an end—any
more than one or six. People will
stay around till they get tired. No
one will ever hand them a piece of
paper and tell them they are fin
ished.
