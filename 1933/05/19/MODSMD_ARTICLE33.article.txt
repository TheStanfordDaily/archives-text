WHAT'S ONE MAN?
The Editor, Sir:
The track team entrains for Bos
ton and the I.C.A.A.A.A. meet Sat
urday night, and because the B.A.C.
has issued orders that expenses
must be pared, some one important
man must be left here, and with
him maybe our chances for winning
the meet. As pointed out there are
15 who are potential point-winners,
and the B.A.C. says that only 14
can go. That means only a saving
of about 7 per cent of the total
expense, and, for this saving we may
have to bow to U.S.C. again. Let the
B.A.C. save this somewhere else and
send the 15 men. What better in
vestment could Stanford make when
so small an amount is involved, and
so much is at stake.
Sincerely yours,
John Sears, '33
