# Sophomore Soccer Team Takes Close Win From Frosh
## 2-1 VICTORY GIVES '35 STARS CHANCE IN FINAL CONTEST 
### Wadsworth White 
Placing themselves in the inter
class soccer finals to be played off
Monday, the sophomores yesterday
downed a unified and fighting
freshman team 2-1.
Bounding off the back of frosh
forward Ray Freer after a goal
threatening fracas in the sophomore
goal mouth, the' ball having just
left the swinging foot of sopohomore
goalie Milt Newman, the leather
pelota rebounded against the mesh
for the first score of the game. This
lucky tally remained the sole score
at the half in spite of numerous
shots allowed the sophomores. These
attempts were well blocked by the
exceptional frosh goalie George
Laird and the two fullbacks, Stan
Huntsberger and Howard Gates.
Ritliicd forward by Doug Ken
nedy, soph captain and star cen
ter half, the second-year men
continued to storm the frosh goal
until two pretty shpts, accredited
lo Cluick Emerick and Miguel
Gomez, varsity players and soph
forwards, slipped into that vital
zone. Gaston Kojas, left inside
forward, and Rudy Gonzales, right
half, were those soph luminaries
who played, with those already
mentioned, excellently.
For the good-playing freshman
squad, Captain Louis Bansbach, left
half, played about the finest gameâ€”
keeping the soph forwards, Rojas
and Maurice Rapf, on their toes or
on the ground. Don Hanson and Bud
Walker, too, were very responsible
for the remarkable freshman of
fensive.
