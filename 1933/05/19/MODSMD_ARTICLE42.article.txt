## 'What's To Do About It?' 
### 
AN OPERETTA WITHOUT MUSIC
ACTS I, 11, AND 111
(SCENE: The neat but not gaudy
living-room of the Templeton man
sion Doors open right, Jeft, front,
and back. A terrier pup is curled
sleepily against a great easy chair.
DINK TEMPLETON is firmly en
sconced in a similar chair, with a
pile of.sports page clippings to his
right and a stack of cigarettes to his
left. 808 JONES sits left front fac
ing a typewriter. DAMON PEGLER
is standing with his back to the
audience, twiddling both his
thumbs).
TEMPLETON: "Well, we only get
to take 14 men East. And S.C. says
they will take about 14, and I'll bet
they show up with 20 who can all
place."
JONES, with an optimistic leer:
"And Yale has entered 72 men."
TEMPLETON: "To hell with Yale.
But it looks like A1 Blackman
doesn't get to make the trip."
PEGLER, who has just bummed
a cigarette and doesn't know what
to do with it: "But Al ran about
48.3 at Fresno."
TEMPLETON: "But but. The
whole situation is a series of 'buts.'
'But' Ed Ablowich has beaten Black
man twice and he'll be East. So will
LuValle of U.C.L.A. and de Baker
of Michigan and Jones of Pennsyl
vania and Warner of Yale. They'll
run under 48 if the track's fast. I
think Al can place, but only 14 can
go."
JONES: "Can Schween get any
points?"
TEMPLETON: "You ask me. Lord,
I'm a track coach, not a prophet.
Lloyd deserves to go on his year's
work and six-feet-four should place.
'But' Ward of Michigan and Spitz
of N.Y.U. and McNaughton and Von
Osdel of S.C. and another smoke
from the East will be jumping. How
do I know if Schween will place on
May 27?"
PEGLER: "Did you hear about
the two Michigan Normal or Michi
gan State vaulters (I forget which)
who did 13 feet 9 inches?"
TEMPLETON: "That makes it
worse. If they're Michigan State
they'll be in the 1.C.4-A.'s, and may
bo Deacon won't place. There's Gra
ber and Miller, and Brown and
Thompson of Yale, and Jefferson of
U.C.L.A. But if they're from Michi
gan Normal they won't be in the
meet. Why the devil don't you get
seme facts?"
PEGLER: "Yes sir. I mean, no sir."
VOICE OFF-STAGE: "Aw, leave
the manager at home."
TEMPLETON, JONES, and PEG
LER: "No!"

i JONES: "Franich is a swell man
ager."
TEMPLETON: "And he's worked
hard for three years."
PEGLER: "And you need a man
ager. A track team always needs a
manager. They're part of the equip
ment."
JONES: "Did you see where S.C.
may stay at the ranch of Jack Fra
legih's uncle in Canada between
the 1.C.4-A.'s and the N.C.A.A.?"
TEMPLETON: "Who cares where
they stay, after the 1.C.4-A.?"
PEGLER: "And did you see where
some friend of Roy Cummings
doped Stanford for 51 points without
Eastman?"
TEMPLETON: "You don't say?
Why, that is most remarkable
mathematical ability. I suppose he
gave the mile to Manager Franich
' and gave myself a win in the two
-1 mile."
JONES: "Aw nerts, I gotta get to
1 work. Let's all go out and con
gratulate Gus Meier on being
elected track captain for next year."
They file slowly off-stage, Tem
pleton stopping on the way long
enough to write a story on the little
j scene for the Chronicle, thus scoop

they'll be in the 1.C.4-A.'s, and may

Thompson of Yale, and Jefferson of

some friend of Roy Cummings
doped Stanford for 51 points without
Eastman?"
TEMPLETON: "You don't say?
Why, that is most remarkable

living-room of the Templeton man
sion Doors open right, Jeft, front,

sleepily against a great easy chair.
DINK TEMPLETON is firmly en

48.3 at Fresno."

'But' Ed Ablowich has beaten Black

LuValle of U.C.L.A. and de Baker
