# R.O.T.C. Horse Show Scheduled For June 3
## 
### 
The annual spring R.O.T.C. horse
show, given each year under the
auspices of Scabbard and Blade,
military honor society, will be given
this year on Saturday, June 3, ac
cording to an announcement last
night by John Robb, who, with
Philippe Gamier, is in charge of
arrangements.
For a time it was feared that the
absence of Captain Gordan might
mean the abandonment of the show,
but it has been decided to hold it in
spite of his absence.
