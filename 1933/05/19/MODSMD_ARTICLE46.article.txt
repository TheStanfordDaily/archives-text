# Stanford Netmen Pass Up Tennis Tourney In South
## 
### 
Stanford's intercollegiate netmen,
Captain Coughlin and Sam Lee, last
night passed up a chance to win
additional glory in Southern Cali

fornia. when they cancelled their
trip in favor of midterm studies.
They were selected by the North
California Tennis Association, along
with Ed Chandler and Gerry Strat
ford, to represent this part of the
state in sectional doubles against the

South, with a view to determining
a team to go East this year.
Lee and Couglin were seeded,
with a good chance of winning their
way to the finals, where they would
probably have met Jack Tidball and
Gene Mako, of the South.
