# Sellards Wins Paris Degree
## 
### 
John Armstrong Sellards, for
merly an instructor in Romanic
Languages at Stanford and subse
quently Dean of the Summer Quar
ter, has been awarded a doctor's
degree by the University of Paris.
Dr. Sellard's thesis on Charles
Didier was favorably received in the
Journal de Geneve of April 3, 1933.
While admitting that Didier was a '
third-rate author, the reviewer con
sidered his life and work worthy of
detailed study because of the milieu
in which he lived. Though tempera
mentally unromantie, Didier enjoyed
the warm friendship and high re
gard of many of the famous roman
tic authors of the first half of the
19th century.
Dr. Sellard's book, published by '
the Librairie Ancienne H. Cham
pion in Paris, is the result of nearly
two years of careful research in the
achiyes and libraries of Geneva,
Rome, Florence, Brussels, Amster
dam, London, and Paris.
