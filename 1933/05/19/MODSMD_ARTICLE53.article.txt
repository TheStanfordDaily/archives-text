# Mothers' Club To Stay With P.T.A. Association
## 
### 
The Stanford Mothers' Club voted
to remain a part of the California
Congress of Parents and Teachers
at a recent meeting. The Club had
considered withdrawal because the j
P.T.A. programs were better fitted '
to lower schools and because of the 1
dues necessary to pay to the State
| organization.
It was pointed out that Stanford i
is benefited by P.T.A. scholarships, '
j and reaps intangible benefits from ;
i the work of the P.T.A. throughout j
the country. Stanford is the only j
member of University standing in i
California.
On the average, there is a divorce j
i every two minutes in the United
; States. !
