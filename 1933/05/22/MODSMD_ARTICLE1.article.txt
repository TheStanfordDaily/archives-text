# Templeton Takes Team Of 15 To IC-4A At Boston
## Al Blackman Added to Original List for Eastern Trip; Miller Sprains Left Ankle at P.A.A. Meet, May Not Be Able to Compete Saturday 
### 
before 4,000 track fans a tasty dish of revelations, disappoint
* incuts, and shattered records, "Dink" Teinplcton's Indians left the
P.A.A. championship title in the windy Kezar stadium Saturday with the
Winged O's, as usual. The Cards tallied (ill points to the Olympic Club's 71.
Big Ben Eastman's long-awaited race, his first chance since his forced
lay-off two months ago, brought in the expected five points, but with; them
the painful evidence that it was hard work! He took the XBO meters in the
slow time of 1:59, two yards ahead of Fresno's Jess Markle, whom East-

man beat by 80 yards last year tc
>et the P.A.A. record of 1:50.

But the biggest blow to Stanford
fans was the call from the pole vault
pits for a doctor, which presaged
the announcement that Bill Miller,
Card hope in the 1.C.4-A.'s, had
sprained his left ankle. Miller
reached 12 feet, G inches; then the
hard luck that has trailed him since
the Cal meet landed him crookedly
on his left ankle, making his par
ticipation in the Boston meet next
Saturday practically an impossi
bility.
Eight Pacific Athletic Association
records went by»the boards in Sat
urday's events, Card stars account
ing for five of them. Little Phil
Morentin set a new P.A.A. time of
34:39.2 in the 10,000 meters, and Al
Blackman copped first in the 400
meters with the new time of 48.9.
Kingsbury Second
Stanford's Gus Meier came
through a fine field to finish first in
the 110-meter high hurdles in 14.7,
a new meet record. Hunt Kings
bury, Card frosh star, was awarded
second in this.
Concluding the list of Stanford
record-breakers, Cotto Herbert es
tablished the time of 23.7 in the low
hurdles, this being the first time
(his event has been run in the
P.A.A.'s, and the Card relay quar
tet—Williams, Herbert, Lornbardi,
and Hables ran the 400-meter race
in 42.8, a new time. Incidentally, the
Indians took first, second, and third
places in the lows, Herbert, Meier,
and Kingsbury finishing in that
order.
The cynosure of all eyes was
Walter Marty, of Fresno, world
champion high-jumper, who hoist
ed liis long legs (! feet 5' i inches
In lake that event; close behind
him was "Bird Legs" Arthur, who
will compete for Stanford next
year.
Living up to expectations, the
weight trio, Lyman, Dunn, and
Grey, carried off the laurels in that
event, Lyman's heave of 51 feet 4.8
inches netting him first place.

the javelin, as was Laborde in the
discus, Laborde being nosed out of j
first place by former star Bob
Jones, now competing under the
Olympic colors.
As for other Card hopes, Hables,
though disappointing in 'the 100-
meter dash, in which he finished
third, came through to take first in
the 200-metcr event. And "Bud"
Deacon saved the Cards from a com
plete shut-out in the pole vault,
achieving a place in a triple tie for 1
1 third.
Surprising too was the defeat of
the Stanford relay team in the 1000- j
meter relay by Fresno State. Black- |
man tried hard but couldn't push
the two yards to beat Harris to the
tape.
