## 
### 
The last meeting of the graduate
women's group, the Blue Stocking
Club, will be held tonight in San
Jose at the home of Mrs. Vivian
j Los.sc Blair. There will be a picnic
| dinner in the garden.
The women are to meet in front
I of the Women's Clubhouse at 5:30
o'clock. Transportation will be pro
vided for everyone and the affair
will be over by 7:30 o'clock.
The main events of the evening
j will be the closing ceremony of the
i club and the installation of Miss
! Edith Mirrielecs as sponsor.
Another matter to be considered
lis petitioning for a graduate mem
j ber of A.W.S. council. The Blue
Stocking Club has been the first
really organized group of the gradu
ate women and the students and
j faculty are anxious that it be con-
I tinued.
