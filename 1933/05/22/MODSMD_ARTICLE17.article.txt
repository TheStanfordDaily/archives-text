## 
### ELIZABETH PAINE 
What will be done willi the new
women? Dean Mary Yost has been
investigating the matter since
Thursday a week ago.
"Now women will call for now
courses and eventually new de
partments," she said yesterday.
"Thus far the women's needs have
been answered along with those of
the men or of necessity, neglected.
Wo hope now to satisfy them inde
pendently. As engineering is pri
marily for men, while not closed to
women I hope wo will have courses
designed for women which men will
have the liberty of entering if they
choose."
Miss Yost thinks that the influx
of new women in the long run will
be beneficial in many ways. At first
she anticipates a difficult period of
adjustment.
"The competition provided by ad
ditional women will change the
women's attitude of being content
with themselves. The best may be

(spurred to make fuller use of their
intellectual potentialities whereas
now they are often satisfied with
sccond-rate work. The general
standard of their work will prob
j cibly rise."
At tho same time the Dean ex
pects that there will be a greater
number of probation and disquali
fication cases in the lower classes
because the new women will not
have to meet quite such high en
trance requirements ;».s did the
"500."
Tho completion of campus poli
tics will be changed gradually, Miss
Yost believes, with the women tak
ing a more active part.
Tho housing question is still un
decided although eventually the
idea of building a group of living
quarters near Roble will probably
be worked out. No change is con
templated in the University's pres
ent policy of not allowing more
; sororities.
