tions are the means of the attain
ment. to the goal."
"The world," he said, "has 1
grown old and rich, hut material
prosperity is only the means to an
end, not a goal in itself. The peo

far our machine civilization has
gone, nor what direction it is tak
ing, but individual leadership has
marked our country from the first,
and will not fail us now."
