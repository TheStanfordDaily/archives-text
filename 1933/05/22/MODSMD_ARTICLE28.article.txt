Hail and Farewell 500! Old Boy
Cameron and that brand new Old
Boy, Algar, have gotten together
again. This time it's the Farewell
500 Number.
"All promises aside,"- said the Old
Boy, "they have to take it again.
Gold did it and gold'll get it in the
end. Take the cover, for instance.
The prettiest little girl, just like
they will be, just, like they aren't,,
all mixed up with coin, Wilbur's
gold. Yes sir, and by old caricatur
ist Thomas, the maestro man.
"Sororities as they arc, a last pic
ture of what still is Stanford life,
in two full pages (Kappas for the
proletariat. Yah, thas the stuff;) and
then for the miserable sum of twen
ty-five cents," said the Old Lads,
"you too may see the pretty birdie.
Boo!"
