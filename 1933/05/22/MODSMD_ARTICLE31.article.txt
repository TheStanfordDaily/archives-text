# Exclusiveness Peculiarâ€” Or Exclusiveness Genuine?

### 
In litis onco a year issue, llie "f>00" raises her proud and
sliapelv head with full authority. She is more confident
than ever, realizing thai more women on the "Farm," a
mere plea three years ago, has now become an actuality.
Willi this realization comes the assurance that we are
thought of no longer as an addition to Stanford University,
but as ;i vital pari of il and that the officials have aban
doned their men-mindedness to think in terms of students.
Some have bemoaned the enlarged women's quota on
the grounds that our exclusiveness is thereby lost but Ibis
' exclusivcncss" has not been good for us. II has made us
a narrower, less homogeneous, group and has created an
abnormal community at Stanford.
Let us, then, be exceptional on a higher scale and let
that exclusiveness be based not on number but upon ideals
and potential promotion of a higher mental and social
culture in the world which we are about to meet.
