changes which their presence will create. Among them

present five to one ratio of men and women, the Division
of (iraphic Art has an enrollment of half men and half
women. More women will increase (his department and
will augment the ranks of the classes in dramatics as well.
A demand will doubtless arise for a course in music.
Why cannot Stanford plan for this future contingency
and gradually build toward an integration of the arts in a
Department of Fine Arts. The interrelation of the arts
makes such an arrangement equally as logical and bene

Social Sciences. II would facilitate the work of students
wishing to work along various artistic lines.
In a university where specialized courses are given such
emphasis as at Stanford, a Department of Fine Arts should
be included to round out the academic field.
