Tlkil those who have been admitted must he housed, is;
;is niiieli ii truism ;is the fact that what goes up must come j
down, and so the housing problem is taking ils toll in brain- !
work iind worry. One tradition in eonneetion with the !
women's housing problem looms vital and well worth I
maintaining. That is Ihe practice of ;ill freshman women !
living together for their first year at Stanford.
II is for this purpose that rushing has been deferred to
winter quarter. Such a custom has served lo orient the
new women more etli'cientlv and uniformly and to organize
Ihe class as a unit before sorority affiliations and other
individual interests arc assumed.
W illi Ihe new women outnumbering those who have
been here before, such a process will play an even more j
important and necessary part in the business of assimila
tion. Since Ihe women now residents of Roble have been
guaranteed rooms in the dormitory, the best solution lies
in the proposed plan of completing the second unit of Roble !
which ought to house one hundred more women. Let us
hope thai the administration can see ils way clear to do
this now when construction prices arc at a minimum.
