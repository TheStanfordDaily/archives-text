# A 						New Dealâ€” Can Pan-Hellenic Take It?
## 
### 
Pan-Ilellenic, one of the most denounced organizations j
on the campus, will, with the advent of the now women, ;
have an opportunity to tear up their frequently attacked ,
rules and with dignity compose an effective set.
Just what lines the new plan will follow will depend on
the housing conditions and on the number of women en
tering. II has been suggested that upper class transfers be '
rushed ut the beginning of autumn quarter, in order that
they may move into the sorority houses at once, while
Ireslunen and sophomores remain governed by deferred
rushing rules. On 11 other hand, several ])eriods of rush- [
ing during autumn quarter, similar to men's rushing, may
be preferred to a series of Pan-Hellenic teas. In either of j
the latter two cases one tinal period of rushing would be i
held in winter quarter*
\\ halever plan is adopted, one rule stands to be abol
ished. Summer rushing, forbidden but ever-present,
should be permitted. With the large nuyiber of rushees, |
il will be difficult tor each house to line up a class to its!
satisfaction under any of the proposed regulations. Sum-j
mer rushing gives an opportunity for both How and rusheo
to become better acquainted and increases the likelihood
of women's pledging houses to which they are well suited. |
Practiced successfully in other universities, its introduction '
here would solve a situation which would otherwise work
a hardship on all concerned.
The opportunity is yours, Pan-llellenic.
