# BULL SESSION
## AN OPEN LETTER TO END ALL OPEN LETTERS 
### ELIZABETH CHAPIN 
Dear New Women (may your tribe
increase):
Now that the administration has
got you on tho list and there'll none
of you be missed, there are a few
things which you really should
know. You see, you are now One
of Many. (Or '"E Pluribus Unutn,"
as we say in academic circles.)
You will be greeted by a Rejuve
nated Roble, which will have added
to its present A, B, and C wings an
entire alphabet of wings extending,
roughly speaking, to Menlo. Here
the first outward and visible sign of
the inward and spiritual welcome
which awaits you is your sponsor.
Her attitude varies from (1) God's
in His heaven, to (2) let them eat
cake. But she is your only help in
time of need; guard her, cherish
her, mention her in your prayers.
Before you know it, it is Catch A
Freshman Week, during which little
Hope Less and her classmates mount
their tandems, screw their courage
to the respective sticking places, and
peddle up a wide street to visit
People. On the surface, this is about
as as falling off a log; actually,
it is infinitely more painful. But it's
an ill wind that blows no freshman
good.
.And just so you won't beat me to
it, I suppose I should mention here

Lnd now (sh!) —MEN. Stanford is a
place where men are men, but only
a few shrewd women notice it. The
males spend their time in small
circles between the Law Steps
(you'll learn about that) and the
Library (you may never learn about
that).
On the not illogical, nay, very
astute, assumption that fifty million
freshmen can't be wronged, the
Powers now estimate that there will
be, roughly, one and a quarter men
to every woman. Now, that is really
plenty, and you will find that old
women are going to be grateful to
you for taking some of their petty
troubles off their hands. Unless, of
course, you should find occasion to
i)ay in dulcet tones, "You USED to
go with him, didn't you?" Women
and elephants never forget.
And, as for the men, October 1
will be a field day for them—a sort
of peace-time "Hello to Arms."
Last, and by all means least, there
are classes—and very Grade A ones
they are. But we never mention
them any more.
And thus will we greet you, with
a smile hiding a broken heart. Lord,
Lord, the pity of it, and that is the
lament of a broken blossom.
—Elizabeth Chapin
