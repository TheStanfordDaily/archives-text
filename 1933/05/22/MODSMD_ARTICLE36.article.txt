RASPUTIN ANI) THE EMPRESS—
At the Stanford Theatre.
This picture will stand as the
\ greatest achievement of the film iri
! dustry for this year. There is hardly
f a flaw in the entire cast, and it is
| almost impossible to decide which
i of (he Barrymores carries off the
! acting honors, so incomparable are
[ their performances.
The story, laid upon true
I facts, is a record of the politics and
! events which led to the downfall of
! the Romanoffs. Despite the heaviness
' of the material making up the plot,
i the film holds the audience spell
j bound without a lapse during its
' entire running.
j The tale of Rasputin and the Em
press is neither humorous nor mor
| bid, and the best explanation for
: its remarkable entertainment value
| is the old adage, "Truth is stranger
I than fiction." —Gruenberg
LAWYER MAN and UNDER THE
| TONTO RIM—At the Varsity
Theatre.
"Lawyer Man" presents a some
what overworked tale of the gruffly
j big-hearted East Side New York
i lawyer William Powell, who fights
his way to the top, finds himself
trapped by the wiles of the cus
tomary blonde into what would have
been ruin for the ordinary mortal,

! but being the hero of this picture
he of course manages to rise once j
more to the pinnacles of success 1
and with the help of his faithful
| little secretary (also blonde, inci
dentally) who has stuck by his side j
; since the East Side days, defeats his
| crooked enemies, then refuses the
1 district attorneyship and returns j
(with the secretary) to the East Side
! to be honest and to help the poor
I and downtrodden. Joan Blondell is
exceedingly winsome as the inele
gant, but spunky, secretary. This i
reviewer cannot speak for Powell,
because she "would not like him
even if he were good."
As for Zane Grey's "Under the
; Tonto Rim," featuring Stuart Erwin,
it goes without saying that there are

cattle fording streams, shooting
scrapes, underhanded villains, hard
riding cowboys, a girl from the city,
and a final fadeout in which the
misunderstood hero proves his met
tle before the aforementioned girl
who falls into his outstretched arms;
the villains are exposed, the stolen
cattle recovered, and all is well.
However, for one who is not too
exacting in his tastes there are mo
ments of excitement. In fact, it is
not such a bad picture, as Westerns
go. ' —Ricciardi

Theatre.
"Lawyer Man" presents a some
what overworked tale of the gruffly
j big-hearted East Side New York
i lawyer William Powell, who fights
his way to the top, finds himself
trapped by the wiles of the cus
tomary blonde into what would have
been ruin for the ordinary mortal,

! but being the hero of this picture
he of course manages to rise once j
more to the pinnacles of success 1
and with the help of his faithful
| little secretary (also blonde, inci
dentally) who has stuck by his side j
; since the East Side days, defeats his
| crooked enemies, then refuses the
1 district attorneyship and returns j
(with the secretary) to the East Side
! to be honest and to help the poor
I and downtrodden. Joan Blondell is
exceedingly winsome as the inele
gant, but spunky, secretary. This i
reviewer cannot speak for Powell,
because she "would not like him
even if he were good."
As for Zane Grey's "Under the
; Tonto Rim," featuring Stuart Erwin,
it goes without saying that there are

cattle fording streams, shooting
scrapes, underhanded villains, hard
riding cowboys, a girl from the city,
and a final fadeout in which the
misunderstood hero proves his met
tle before the aforementioned girl
who falls into his outstretched arms;
the villains are exposed, the stolen
cattle recovered, and all is well.
However, for one who is not too
exacting in his tastes there are mo
ments of excitement. In fact, it is
not such a bad picture, as Westerns
go. ' —Ricciardi
RASPUTIN ANI) THE EMPRESS—
At the Stanford Theatre.
This picture will stand as the
\ greatest achievement of the film iri
! dustry for this year. There is hardly
f a flaw in the entire cast, and it is
| almost impossible to decide which
i of (he Barrymores carries off the
! acting honors, so incomparable are
[ their performances.
The story, laid upon true
I facts, is a record of the politics and
! events which led to the downfall of
! the Romanoffs. Despite the heaviness
' of the material making up the plot,
i the film holds the audience spell
j bound without a lapse during its
' entire running.
j The tale of Rasputin and the Em
press is neither humorous nor mor
| bid, and the best explanation for
: its remarkable entertainment value
| is the old adage, "Truth is stranger
I than fiction." —Gruenberg
