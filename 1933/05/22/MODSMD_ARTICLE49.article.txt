# Final Meets In Women's Swimming Begin Today

The second and final round of the
women's interclass swimming meets
will begin today with a double meet
at 4 o'clock in the Roble pool. The
freshmen will compete against the
sophomores, and the junioi-s against
the seniors. The freshmen were
victorious last week in winning the
first round, which was more or less
a practice meet.
The competition will continue
during the week with the meets on
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
The meet will wind up on Field
Day, June 1, with the awarding of
a cup to the winning class.
