What with Champ Miller getting
himself banged up in the P.A.A.
Saturday and Big Ben getting his
heels all tangled up in the Markle
of Fresno State, Dink entrained his
boys for Boston feeling just a mite
low.
IS 111 they took A1 Blackmail
along. So there!
Our old friend, "Herbie," Fleish
hacker to you, was out there on the
field horsing around with Here La
borde and managing to capture a
third for the Olympic Club in the
SG-1 b. weight throw.
Another ex-Stanford man did his
Alma Mater dirt. Bob Jones took
five good first-place discus points
home to the Winged O's, leaving his
old teammate and new opponent,
Luborde, a foot and some behind in
second place.
And was Dink sowing seeds for
next season? Unattached "Bird
legs" Arthur, one of the promis
ing Farm lads, got a personal
cheer from the Boy Coach him
self. on his second-place jump tie.
This boy Marty from Fresno is all
set to give flying lessons if the de
pression lasts over the summer. He
had half the gallery following him
around Ihe field to get a good look
ai his take-off for his G foot 5V2
inch flight over the bar.
And on top of all this Stanford's
'•500" are priming for their farewell
Field Day on May 1. The big battle
of the year in archery, swimming,
tennis, golf, and whatall.
And since this is a woman's edi

' tion, more ox* less—
Did you know that the gals are
harboring a former Junior National
Chap in their midst? She goes by
the name of Helen Fulton and
though she hasn't gotten around to
playing on the Farm as yet, Betts
Hawkins and Alice Philp are polish
ing their rackets in anticipation oi'
showing their mettle.
There's a freshman all-around
star named Kitty Ah runs who has
already smashed every women's
freestyle record made in a Roble
pool. With a little competition she
stands a good chance of cutting
down her four seconds short of
the world's record in the 50-yard
clash. Watch out, Ilelene!
Of course you've heard about
Stanford's walk-away with three
places in the National Women's In-
I tercollegiate Archery contest last
year. Just like that!
And what will a couple of hun
dred more women do?

There's a freshman all-around
star named Kitty Ah runs who has
already smashed every women's
freestyle record made in a Roble
pool. With a little competition she
stands a good chance of cutting
down her four seconds short of
the world's record in the 50-yard
clash. Watch out, Ilelene!
Of course you've heard about
Stanford's walk-away with three
places in the National Women's In-
I tercollegiate Archery contest last
year. Just like that!
And what will a couple of hun
dred more women do?

What with Champ Miller getting
himself banged up in the P.A.A.
Saturday and Big Ben getting his
heels all tangled up in the Markle
of Fresno State, Dink entrained his
boys for Boston feeling just a mite
low.
IS 111 they took A1 Blackmail
along. So there!
Our old friend, "Herbie," Fleish
hacker to you, was out there on the
field horsing around with Here La
borde and managing to capture a
third for the Olympic Club in the
SG-1 b. weight throw.
Another ex-Stanford man did his
Alma Mater dirt. Bob Jones took
five good first-place discus points
home to the Winged O's, leaving his
old teammate and new opponent,
Luborde, a foot and some behind in
second place.
And was Dink sowing seeds for
next season? Unattached "Bird
legs" Arthur, one of the promis
ing Farm lads, got a personal
cheer from the Boy Coach him
self. on his second-place jump tie.
This boy Marty from Fresno is all
set to give flying lessons if the de
pression lasts over the summer. He
had half the gallery following him
around Ihe field to get a good look
ai his take-off for his G foot 5V2
inch flight over the bar.
And on top of all this Stanford's
'•500" are priming for their farewell
Field Day on May 1. The big battle
of the year in archery, swimming,
tennis, golf, and whatall.
And since this is a woman's edi

' tion, more ox* less—
Did you know that the gals are
harboring a former Junior National
Chap in their midst? She goes by
the name of Helen Fulton and
though she hasn't gotten around to
playing on the Farm as yet, Betts
Hawkins and Alice Philp are polish
ing their rackets in anticipation oi'
showing their mettle.
