# Juniors, Sophs Vie Today For Title In Soccer
## 
### 
Captained by Doug Kennedy, the j
sophomores meet the juniors on the |
soccer field this afternoon to fight
off the juniors' pretensions to the
championship which last year's frosh j
captured and intend to retain, de
spite the fact that the odds are with j
the third-year men strengthened by
the presence of some of the best j
varsity material.
The sophomores are in possession j
of a halfback line which is powerful
enough to counterbalance a good j
part of this opposition ,and coupled j
with this is a promising forward |
line in the hands of Chuck Emerick, j
Gaston Rojas, and Miguel Gomez, j
Opposing them will probably be: |
Carl Knecht, Alberto Navarro, Cy |
Johnson, Dante Siracusa. Art Hearn,
and Sven Dodington, playing and ;
subbing in the forward line; Johnny
Hitehock, Dave Dunning, and Carl j
Krebs, halfbacks; Dick Strousc and
Rod Lewis, fullbacks; and Jack
King, goalie. Eight of these have
earned letters in soccer.
John Phillip Sousa, "The March ;
King," died in March.
