Friday's game between the Alpha
Delt's and El Toro proved to be a
repetition of a week ago, when the
clubmen emerged victorious in an
pxtra-inning fracas. Starting the
seventh inning with the Alpha Delts

leading 5-2, the Toros scored four
runs to win. The Alpha Delts tied
the count, when Van Dellen rounded
three bases on a passed ball and the
Toro catcher, Kahn, played caddy
looking for the ball. The eighth in
ning saw a run scored by Byrd of
the club and the Alpha Delts went
down 1-2-3, when their turn at bat
came.
The game was featured by the
pitching of Reed, Toro, and Lee of
the Alpha Delts, both of whom did
not receive the support they de
served. G. Fuller of Alpha Delt hit
well.
All men participating in the play
ofT games must have competed in
at least one league game. Fifth
round schedule will appear in Tues
day's paper and is posted on the
gym bulletin board.
