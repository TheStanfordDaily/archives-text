# Ice Age Not Indicated By Recent Cold Spells

Speculations that we are rapidly
approaching an icc age, uttered
during the past few weeks by stu
dents who between classes seek out
the few sunny spots on the Quad,
are upheld bu,t slightly by the cam
pus temperature charts.
From the second floor of the
physics department, where weather
records are kept under the super
vision of Professor Joseph G. Brown,
comes the information that the aver
age temperature for this month, up
to yesterday, has been 53.8 degrees
Fahrenheit; and that does not in
clude the few days to come which
are, it is hoped, to be the average
raiser. The average for the month of

| May last year was 58.8 degrees, but ;
in 1929 was only 56.5 degrees.
The 2 o'clock sun-bath of last
, May was eight Farenheit degrees j
j more effective than that of 1933,
Russell Neilsen of the physics de
i partment pointed out by showing i
1 comparative afternoon records. And i
. a practical use of winter coats and j
1 closed cars is suggested by the fact j
that there is 13 degrees difference j
between day and night averages.
According to Professor Brown, the
present epidemic of shivers is due j
]to the low barometric depression
over the Pacific area, and is not in- '
dicative of a change of permanent |
. cold.
