## Reynolds Describes Trial As Social Test 
### 
"When the public takes the initia
tive, it is an important case. It is
justified that Mooney be given even
more than a fair chance, to show the
public that jusliee is going out of
it.s way to keep faith," was the opin
ion of Charles Nathan Reynolds,
professor of sociology here, on the
importance of the pending Mooney
trial.
Professor Reynolds yesterday ex
plained that to his mind this case
tests our social solidarity and the
faith of the people in our institu
tions, since the "trial shows that the
court is trying to give a square
deal."
"There Is an honest difference of
opinion, with good authorities on
both sides. II rests on it.s own merits,
but has become a case of infraction
of personal liberty in the public
eye."
It now rests more on what the
people think the ease means than
on its original meaning, Professor
Reynolds s'aid.
It is because of this becoming a
case of "what the people think it
means" that its importance in the
people's faith in justice is so im
portant, he explained.
