## 
### GEORGE WILSON 
Expressing confidence in the fun
i dumental soundness of Roosevelt's
j policy of inflation, Professor George
i W. Dowrie of the Graduate School
I of lousiness presented this subject
as a part of his discussion on "Re
-1 building tlie Financial Structure'' at
the Alumni conference held here
Sunday afternoon.
"As I see it, the farmer will be
! the one to benefit most from this
I current inflation," said Dowrie. Com
menting on pj'oposed methods of in
, flation, he said that if a metallic
standard were adopted he would
like to see it international in scope,
although he stated that the present
: administration was unfavorable to
i this plan.
When asked what his views were?
lon government operation of banking,
Dowrie answered that he preferred
1 to see the government in the role
of a referee at a football game.
"Of course a referee has to take
the ball away sometimes," he made
j clear, "but at this time the govern
ment isn't ready to operate our
banking system. Bankers ought to

! br able to run their own affairs in
telligently, anyway."
A leader at another conference
was Professor Guido Marx, who had
! .1; his subject, "Can Industry Make
llself Depression Proof?" Marx pre
sented an analysis of industry's
fundamental problem, that of bal
ancing production, consumption, and
I distribution.
"The fundamental thing," he
j stilled, "in keeping our industrial
mechanism going, is to shift Ihe
emphasis from production for mone
tary profits to production of prod
ucts expressed in material terms;
land to put into consumption or pur
chasing power what is now going
into the capital fund."
"The engineer must relate indus
try to social needs," he said. "The
lid has lifted from the human mind.
We can now legally think and talk
Jon economic problems. We must
analyze our present economic laws,
and make new ones if they seem
necessary. The hopeful part of the
present outlook is that experiments
pre being carried on with this view
. in mind."
