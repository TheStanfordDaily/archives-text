# The 						World's a Stageâ€” Most Students Come In Late
## 
### 
There is much talk educators concerning Ihe
]>;irl played bv American universities in lilting men and
women for a place in a civilized democracy. Vel every
year thousands of students are turned out into Ihe world
without the slightest knowledge of how to read, under
stand, or evaluate the crucial events ol* the current time.
From freshman to senior years practically all students
go through their courses blissfully ignorant of all available
knowledge of the world's happenings. How are they, as
graduated citizens, going to make intelligent decisions on
local, national, or world problems? Political, economic,
and social upheavals are taking place daily under the noses
of thousands of students but they are oblivious to any event
that does not appeal' in a news reel.
It is true that Stanford has a required course in citizen
ship but it is given only for freshmen and consequently
heartily disliked and forgotten as soon as possible by the
great majority who lake it. The ideal course would be one
which extended through the entire four-year course and
which would not attempt to dogmatize but would inspire
interest in economic and political current events.
Most citizens devote their reading time to comics, col
umnists, and magazine fiction, not because they lack a po
tential interest in the dramatic events on the world's stage,
but because they lack Ihe background to appreciate the
action taking place. They are like late-comers to a drama.
Having missed the tirsl act, they fail to understand the
interplay of events and characters.
The purpose of education is to set up desirable habits.
Students who know enough about interesting and signifi
cant current events to appreciate and interpret them be
come inquisitive. Fascinated bv the spectacle of history in
tiie making on a dozen world fronts, their interest forces
them to seek out newspapers, magazines, and other sources
of iliformation.
Becoming highly interested they will become somewhat
informed, giving birth to Ihe hope that they may also he
conic somewhat intelligent citizens in this somewhat demo
cratic nation. ,
