# Matronfy, Perhaps, But Sane and Conservative

Willi ;in almost matronly conservatism typical of the
(diversity's women since 1891, tin* opinions of yesterday's
editorial column expressed an entirely sane outlook on
the coming additions to the HI 10.
The snipes!ions for a larger Hoblc, lor a department of
line arts, and for a revision of Pan-Hellenic regulations,
are worth serious consideration.
In connection with the proposal for an "integration of
the arts" in a separate and enlarged school, however, it
must lie remembered that the I 'diversity since its founding
has always specialized in medicine, law, science in general,
and engineering in particular. It is in these fields that Stan
lord has become known. The formation of even the School
of Social Sciences, now an integral part of the curriculum,
was seen as a step away from the original principles. An
additional school, an even further step, may not meet with
unqualified acceptance.
To be commended is the suggestion that Pan-Ilellenic,
admittedly "one of the most denounced organizations on
the campus," revise its complicated and involved rules.
Saner, simpler, and more sensible regulations should be
substituted for those which have long made life feverishly
uncertain for incoming women.
Stanford women may be matronly and conservative,
but they proved themselves yesterday to be capable also
of a sane and commendable attitude.
