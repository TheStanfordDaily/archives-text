# A 						Chance to Help Toward The Building of Stanford's New Theatre
## 
### 
The first active student effort toward the building of a
new theatre for Stanford is scheduled for a week from
Friday, tl is to be an all-l Diversity dance â€”not a jolly-lip
the proceeds to go toward the theatre fund.
This is another of those affairs well worth supporting
as nil those who have attended plavs iu the Assembly Hall
I:now. The price of the bids is to be 50 cents and reliable
reports have it that the dance itself, aside from its ultimate
purpose, will be well worth the cost.
The orchestra is donating its services and all the other
necessities have been obtained at cost or entirely without
cost. As a consequence practically all the money taken in
will be available for the very important fund.
The whole affair looks to be one which is well worth
anyone's support.
