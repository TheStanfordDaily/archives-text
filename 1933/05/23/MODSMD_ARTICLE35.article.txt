rights. After all, what is $160? After
spending hours adding up war debts
and reparations, how can anyone
get excited over that insignificant
sum? After learning about the in
finities of space, the nebular worlds,
and the immensity of geologic time,
how can anyone even consider $160?
Days before the Junior Prom was
presented, Burson knew he would
be playing at a San Francisco thea
tre that night. At least those of the
Campus who read the show adver
tisements in the City papers knew
it. He would never try to handle
two jobs at the same moment—if
both were with commercial estab
lishments. But one job was at Stan
lord, and after all they would prob
ably pay anyway. But they haven't
yet; and the rumor is that the Prom
committee will stand by what is
right and refuse the full sum. They
should.
The salesman in the big city is
sure that every person on any col
lege campus is a sucker for what
ever he has to sell. What he is sell
ing matters not. Stanford is prob
ably down on their lists with all the
other colleges. I don't mind going
to college, but I have an antipathy
toward being a sucker.
If this $160 is not paid to Mr.
Burson our standing in the City will
rise. Orchestra leaders will know
that when they agree to play they
will have to play. That is not asking
too much.

spending hours adding up war debts
and reparations, how can anyone
get excited over that insignificant
sum? After learning about the in
finities of space, the nebular worlds,
and the immensity of geologic time,
how can anyone even consider $160?
Days before the Junior Prom was
presented, Burson knew he would
be playing at a San Francisco thea
tre that night. At least those of the
Campus who read the show adver
tisements in the City papers knew
it. He would never try to handle
two jobs at the same moment—if
both were with commercial estab
lishments. But one job was at Stan
lord, and after all they would prob
ably pay anyway. But they haven't
yet; and the rumor is that the Prom
committee will stand by what is
right and refuse the full sum. They
should.
The salesman in the big city is
sure that every person on any col

ever he has to sell. What he is sell
ing matters not. Stanford is prob
ably down on their lists with all the
other colleges. I don't mind going
to college, but I have an antipathy
toward being a sucker.
If this $160 is not paid to Mr.
Burson our standing in the City will
rise. Orchestra leaders will know
that when they agree to play they
will have to play. That is not asking
too much.
