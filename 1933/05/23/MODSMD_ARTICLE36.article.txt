THE PASSING OF A TRADITION
i —A comment upon screen writers.
In July 1931 a red-faced Theodore
! Dreiser directed his attorneys to
proceed against the Paramount Pub
i iix Corporation for "libelously dis
i torting" his ponderous American
Tragedy in filming it. At the time
j Dreiser swore roundly that the in
i diistry should never again maltreat
j any of his works.
I Last month the Paramount Cor
! poration announced that \t had ob
: tamed film rights for his Jennie
J Gerhardt. This reversal of Dreiser
: ian opinion is doubly amusing in
! that the announcement is followed
! by another asserting that adaptation
1 of the film is to be left entirely in
j the hands of the producers,
j In protesting against the film ver
! sion of his American Tragedy, Drei-
I ser was doing no more than echoing
I a long shout which began years ago
and founded the tradition that
i Hollywood's treatment of the ma
| terial that it bought was, to say the
! least, peculiar. An amusing corollary
was added to the effect that only
the titles of the works were used
an> way.
But Hollywood has proved, par
i ticularly within the last few years,
; that such a tradition is by no means
infallible. Faithful observance of
| the text has been frequent (The
| Guardsman, Journey's End, to name
| two examples) and occasionally the
I film adaptation has been better than
l ihe original script by the very
! necessity of making it compact. This
| was particularly evident in Cynara
i and A Bill of Divorcement. In the
j latter several unnecessary charac
ters were eliminated and the film
unified to a greater extent than the
I singe play had been.
Further, film adapters (of whom
Ben Hecht is, surprisingly enough,
| outstanding) have occasionally
I changed the emphasis to improve

I upon the original. Howard Estabrook
1 and Henry Gribble, besides making
the improvements noted above, in
! serted the revelation of insanity by
Sydney to her lover. This change
emphasized the problem set forth in
the plot and offered Katherine Hep
j burn and David Manners a far bet
| t' ; r final scene than the stage ver
! s!on had.
It might have been expected that
. the ironic final reversal in Topaze
1 v/culd delight the sardonic Ben
| Hecht because it was amusingly
cynical, however unbelievable it
• might have been in the character
of the schoolmaster.
But Hecht showed excellent judg
ment in substituting for it an end
ing which left a basically unchanged,
i if dapper, Topaze. This was a far
, more touching and far more cred
ible finale than that Marcel Pagnol
had originally written; it made of a
i trivial comedy an extraordinarily
! poignant tragedy, amusing on the
surface but of savage bitterness un
derneath.
And these are some of the reasons
■j-v.hy an outworn tradition, while
.still largely applicable to cheaper

works, can be .set aside; for there ,
must be, after such films as have;
been mentioned, a growing admira
tion for an industry which is show- ,
i",g greater strides toward true art- !
! istry—if in a melee of necessary
mediocrity—than it has ever made
be fore—in one direction at least.
