WINTKY BLAST
(From address to U.C. graduates)
"Be conscious that you are, in so
far as we can make you, trained lor
the task. The world is yours to con
quer. All we have to offer has been
given you. Beyond is the cold, cold
world . . .
The speaker said "conquer and win."'
He pointed out "liquor and sin."
Said he to his fold:
"Out yonder 'tis cold . . .
And icicles dripped from his chin.

PAGE TEMPLETON!
(From the S.F. Chronicle)
BYRON—Henry Mitchell, itiner
ant workman, broke the world's
record for the four-mile run today.
Despite the fact that he had never
trained for the event, he ran the
distance between Brentwood and
Byron in 7 minutes flat. Mitchell
stood beside the highway with his
blanket roll over his shoulder and
his thumb bent in the national
highway "lift" signal. He stood too
close to a passing truck. A loop on
his blanket roll snagged a projec
tion on the truck, and Mitchell, un
willingly, started on his four-mile
run.
Uunable to free himself or attract
the attention of the driver, Mitchell
paced into Byron at a terrific rate,
lie estimates his peak cruising stride
was 17 feet !) inches and in one
place he made IS feet 2 inches.
