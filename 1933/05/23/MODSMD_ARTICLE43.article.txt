I have learned upon good author
ity that there will be much running
and jumping around and throwing
of such things as spheroidal balls of
metal and brass-bound plates,
This most entrancing bit of in
formation was relayed to me by
the Associated Press, who most
kindly sent me a Sports Release
yesterday filled with news of the
coming "large cmbroglio." And
pre-eminent among the eight col
umns was the word "Yale," re
peated several times as a Dark
blue Horse that will upset the
Trojan and Cardinal hopes.
Although, in be.st journalese tra
dition, the release contained little
factual information, I managed to
lead through enough lines to learn
that Yale expects three firsts and
sundry other digits. Keith Brown,
pole-vaulter par excellence, is of
course one of the Yale hopes, and
his teammate Wirt Thompson ex
peels to be right up there. And,
although il sounds funny to Coast
fans, Brown has n chance to out
vault Bills Miller and Graber.
But that ain't the half of it.
* Yale also has a discus-thrower
in the Laborde class, he being
none other than footballer Joe
Crowley. And Karl Warner, a
member of the Olympic team, is
somewhat of a quarter-milcr
(which becomes, in the new sports
language, a "four-hundred-me
terer").
Yale's other big shots are hur
dlers Lockwood and Dunbar. Now
1 am not writing this to scare any
one, but simply to illustrate that
back East they at least think they
have some running boys, too.
But anyway, the Associated Press
release had "Shot put—All points
waived to Southern California and
Stanford."
Jake Irwin "'as busy advertising
Luckies when 1 dropped in on him
yesterday. A large cloud of blue
smoke waved gaily overhead; the
bands were playing; Ben Hur came
galloping around the corner . . . .
My gosh, that's the wrong para
graph.
Anyway, Jake said dial maybe
perhaps there would be two prices
on alumni Big Game tickets next
year. Now this is most unofficial
information, but the idea is that
the alumni pay more than stu
dents, than faculty, than Stadium
subscribers, and than strip-hold
ers and receive poorer seats.
The scheme being considered by
the B.A.C. is to segregate the first
few rows of seats behind both goal
posts and to allow alumni who so
desire to purchase tickets at a re
duced price. And although the whole
thing is but a scheme, it. sounds
good to this rooter.

dition, the release contained little
factual information, I managed to
lead through enough lines to learn
that Yale expects three firsts and
sundry other digits. Keith Brown,
pole-vaulter par excellence, is of
course one of the Yale hopes, and
his teammate Wirt Thompson ex
peels to be right up there. And,
although il sounds funny to Coast
fans, Brown has n chance to out
vault Bills Miller and Graber.
But that ain't the half of it.
* Yale also has a discus-thrower
in the Laborde class, he being
none other than footballer Joe
Crowley. And Karl Warner, a
member of the Olympic team, is
somewhat of a quarter-milcr
(which becomes, in the new sports
language, a "four-hundred-me
terer").
Yale's other big shots are hur
dlers Lockwood and Dunbar. Now
1 am not writing this to scare any
one, but simply to illustrate that
back East they at least think they
have some running boys, too.
But anyway, the Associated Press
release had "Shot put—All points
waived to Southern California and
Stanford."
Jake Irwin "'as busy advertising
Luckies when 1 dropped in on him
yesterday. A large cloud of blue
smoke waved gaily overhead; the
bands were playing; Ben Hur came
galloping around the corner . . . .
My gosh, that's the wrong para
graph.
Anyway, Jake said dial maybe
perhaps there would be two prices
on alumni Big Game tickets next
year. Now this is most unofficial
information, but the idea is that
the alumni pay more than stu
dents, than faculty, than Stadium
subscribers, and than strip-hold
ers and receive poorer seats.
The scheme being considered by
the B.A.C. is to segregate the first
few rows of seats behind both goal
posts and to allow alumni who so
desire to purchase tickets at a re
duced price. And although the whole
thing is but a scheme, it. sounds
good to this rooter.

I have learned upon good author
ity that there will be much running
and jumping around and throwing
of such things as spheroidal balls of
metal and brass-bound plates,
This most entrancing bit of in
formation was relayed to me by
the Associated Press, who most
kindly sent me a Sports Release
yesterday filled with news of the
coming "large cmbroglio." And
pre-eminent among the eight col
umns was the word "Yale," re
peated several times as a Dark
blue Horse that will upset the
Trojan and Cardinal hopes.
Although, in be.st journalese tra
dition, the release contained little
factual information, I managed to
