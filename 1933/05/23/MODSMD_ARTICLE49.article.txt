# IC-4A PROMISES CLOSE SPRINT. HURDLE RACES
## 
### ALBERT GUERARD, JR 
Although Stanford and U.S.C. are
taking East a formidable array of
sprinters and hurdlers, Pacific Coast
strength in these events may prove
second best.
While Western dashmen and low
hui dlers have exceeded the best
marks of their rivals on the Atlantic
Seaboard, the delicate legs of the
men in these events suffer more
from the 3500-mile jaunt than those
ol their less speedy teammates.
The trip to Cambridge, with its
accompanying change in climate,
usually cuts between one and
three-tenths of a second from the
speed of the California athletes]
SPRINTS —If the defeat of Abe
Hables in the P.A.A. 100-meter race
Saturday may be disregarded, the
Stanford sprinter would be a logical
favorite to win both dashes. But
U.S.C.'s two aces, Charley Parsons
and Les Ball, are physically strong
er men, and consequently may stand
the trip better.
The East will present Dick Hardy
'ox Cornell, a strong contender in the
1931 and 1932 1.C.4-A. meets, Dick
Bell of M.1.T., Bob Jonson of
Princeton, Eddie Calvin of Harvard,
and perhaps Willis Ward of Michi
gan. Hardy is a consistent 9.8 and

21.G runner; he will probably take
about two points in the two races.
Bell is a good man over the short
route, while Jonson's forte is the 200
meters. Calvin of Harvard is the
fastest 100-met6r man entered, but
may confine himself to the high
hurdles and the high jump.
Look out for Ball, Hables, Hardy,
Calvin, and Parsons in the 100;
Hables, Parsons, Ball, Jonson, and
Calvin in the 200 meters.
.HURDLES — The high hurdles
are wide open. Willis Ward ran 14.4
two weeks ago, trailing the great
Jack Keller of Ohio State. Stan
ford's (ius Meier has been con
sistent at 14.7, while Bob Lyon
and Jeddy Welch of U.S.C. and
Charles Lockwood of Yale and
Charles Pessoni of Manhattan Col
lege have all touched 14.5. Pick
Ward to win, with Meier second.
Norman Paul of U.S.C. should
nose out Stanford's Cotto Herbert
in the low barriers, with Lockwood
and Dunbar of Yale a good ten
yards in the rear. The two Califor
nia hurdlers are the class of the
country, barring, of course, Keller.
And Paul or Herbert to beat Keller
over the 200-meter distance is cer
tainly not a laughable bet.

and Jeddy Welch of U.S.C. and
Charles Lockwood of Yale and
Charles Pessoni of Manhattan Col
lege have all touched 14.5. Pick
Ward to win, with Meier second.
Norman Paul of U.S.C. should
nose out Stanford's Cotto Herbert
in the low barriers, with Lockwood
and Dunbar of Yale a good ten
yards in the rear. The two Califor
nia hurdlers are the class of the
country, barring, of course, Keller.
And Paul or Herbert to beat Keller
over the 200-meter distance is cer
tainly not a laughable bet.
Although Stanford and U.S.C. are
taking East a formidable array of
sprinters and hurdlers, Pacific Coast
strength in these events may prove
second best.
While Western dashmen and low
hui dlers have exceeded the best
marks of their rivals on the Atlantic
Seaboard, the delicate legs of the
men in these events suffer more
from the 3500-mile jaunt than those
ol their less speedy teammates.
The trip to Cambridge, with its
accompanying change in climate,
usually cuts between one and
three-tenths of a second from the
speed of the California athletes]
SPRINTS —If the defeat of Abe
Hables in the P.A.A. 100-meter race
Saturday may be disregarded, the
Stanford sprinter would be a logical
favorite to win both dashes. But
U.S.C.'s two aces, Charley Parsons
and Les Ball, are physically strong
er men, and consequently may stand
the trip better.
The East will present Dick Hardy
'ox Cornell, a strong contender in the
1931 and 1932 1.C.4-A. meets, Dick
Bell of M.1.T., Bob Jonson of
Princeton, Eddie Calvin of Harvard,
and perhaps Willis Ward of Michi
gan. Hardy is a consistent 9.8 and

21.G runner; he will probably take
about two points in the two races.
Bell is a good man over the short
route, while Jonson's forte is the 200
meters. Calvin of Harvard is the
fastest 100-met6r man entered, but
may confine himself to the high
hurdles and the high jump.
Look out for Ball, Hables, Hardy,
Calvin, and Parsons in the 100;
Hables, Parsons, Ball, Jonson, and
Calvin in the 200 meters.
.HURDLES — The high hurdles
are wide open. Willis Ward ran 14.4
two weeks ago, trailing the great
Jack Keller of Ohio State. Stan
ford's (ius Meier has been con
sistent at 14.7, while Bob Lyon
and Jeddy Welch of U.S.C. and
Charles Lockwood of Yale and
Charles Pessoni of Manhattan Col
lege have all touched 14.5. Pick
Ward to win, with Meier second.
