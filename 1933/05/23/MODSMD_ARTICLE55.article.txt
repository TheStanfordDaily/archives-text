# Shaw Drama Will Be Final Club Reading
## "Major Barbara" Tells Of Economic Struggle 
### 
George Bernard Shaw's comedy, j
"Major Barbara," will be the last
reading in the series planned this
quarter by Sword and Sandals,
men's honorary dramatic society, i
Ti youts for the reading are to be j
held this afternoon at 4 o'clock in
the Little Theatre.
This modern play, to end the
series which has included an Eliza
bethan tragedy, an eighteenth-cen- I
tury satire, and a nineteenth-cen- *
tury problem play, is a timely one. |
It concerns the perpetual struggle 1
between Capital, represented by
Saint Andrew Undershaft, and La
bor, whose ideals are extolled by a
light-heai ted college professor !
named Cusins.
To complicate matters, Saint An
drews' daughter Barbara zealously ;
spends her time in the relief of the
downtrodden as an officer in the i
Salvation Army.
There are something over a dozen (
roles in the play, the second act in
cluding a number of types. The try
outs are open to all interested, par
ticularly those able to cope with the I
intricacies of the Cockney dialect, j
Every effort will be made to ob- 1
tain as fine a cast for the reading j
as the campus affords. The date for '
the performance is June 1. The Lit- j
tie Theatre will be the scene of the j
Shavian battle.
