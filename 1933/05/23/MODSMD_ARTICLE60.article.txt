# Lee, Mystery Woman Enter Mixed Tennis
## Fulton-Schwayder Combine Still Rated Best 
### 
Sam Lee and the Mystery Wo
man! This is the latest doubles com
j bination to step to the fore as en
j tries draw to a close for the spring
quarter mixed doubles tourney.
With the entry of Lee and his
I campus partner, who is a student
j supposedly of championship calibre
| in wielding a racket, practically all
I of Stanford's first six varsity men
' have entered the contest.
Latest plans by Coach Bugge,
| manager of the tournament, are to
j reserve the three upper varsity
! courts one afternoon next week,
j when the draws are posted, and to
I have many of the matches played
I oil that day. Times and opponents
j will be posted, and thus the tourna
| ment may be run off within a few
| days, and the new doubles team
I champions named.
| Betts Hawkins and Chuck Otis,
j newly favored team, were practicing
| yesterday against Helen Fulton and
j Monty Schwayder, probably the
I smoothest combine yet entered.
\ However, all the advantages these
! two teams have will be neutralized
j by the handicaps, which every en
' tering team will get.
! With the prize of a Morishita
i racket promised the winning woman,
j play will no doubt be closely con
's tested, although the men gain
nothing from their activities except
1 the prestige of occupying Keith
Gledhill's vacant throne of last year.
When interviewed as to the rea- i
| sons for keeping his female partner
a .secret, Lee was quoted as saying
that the Mystery Woman preferred
keeping her tennis identity secret,
until after the first round play was
finished.
