# DAVIS PLEDGES U.S. TO RESIST OFFENSIVE WAR
## Geneva Speech Interpreted To Mean End Of Long Isolation Policy 
### 
GENEVA, May 22 (/P) â€” The
United Slates Government today
pledged itself never to interfere with
international action to deal with a
menace of war once the aggressor
nation responsible for that menace
has been satisfactorily identified.
This far-reaching policy was an
nounced by Norman H. Davis,
President Roosevelt's representa
tive, at the international disarma
m'ent conference. It was immediate
ly interpreted as meaning that in
the future the League of Nations
can boycott, blockade, and otherwise
punish an aggressor without fear of
complications by the United States.
Will Aid Supervision
Mr. Davis also committed the
American Government to partici
pate in "effective automatic and
continuous" international supervi
sion designed (o make certain that
the nations carry out their promises
of disarmament.
"President Roosevelt's message,"
lie said, "is a clear indication of the
fact that the United Stales will
exert its full power find influence
and accept its just share of respon
sibility to make the results in dis
armament definite, prompt, and ef
fective."
Abandon Isolation
lli.s speech, greeted by the cheers
of the delegates of 50 nations, was
accepted by European commenta
tors as marking abandonment of the
traditional American policy of iso
lation and neutrality.
Concretely, the American doctrine
was interpreted to mean that the
British navy now can feel more free
to help the League of Nations keep
the peace because it will be in no
danger of coming to grips with the
American navy.
