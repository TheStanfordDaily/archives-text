# "No Shave," Say Home Kiddies To Local |Barbers
## 
### 
Young though they arc the
Convalescent Home kids know
all of the questions and ran
give hack the answers, accord
ing to local harbers.
Once a month two or three of
the barbers go out to the Home
to administer the annual hair
trimming to 75 or more young
sters. As the kids sit in the
"regular chair," and the home
made piano-stool-chair they
chatter like the best of cus
tomers.
They know whether they do
or don't want a shampoo, shave,
or massage. They know the ball
scores and who's going to win
the Hig (tame.
In about a week the barbers
again trek out to the Home to
cut ofT the long hair in prepa
ration for summer.
