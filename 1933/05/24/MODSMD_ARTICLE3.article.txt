# Lutz Defines Nazi Leader As Showman
## Treaty Revision Thought German Objective 
### 
"The great objective of Germany
is revision of the Versailles treaty,"
Professor Ralph H. Lutz told a large
audience in the Assembly Hall last
night when he discussed Hitler and
his party in a lecture on "Recent
Developments in Germany."
"Hitler," Lutz said, "is a great
orator and a great politician. He is
a master of the psychology of po
litical leadership. He is a man of
tremendous nerve, great personal
courageâ€”an excellent showman. A
master of epithets, he has called his
opponents more picturesque names
than any other German politician.
"Two reasons stand out for the
victory of Hitlerism. First, the eco
nomically ruined middle class looks
to Hitler to raise the standard of
life in Germany. Second, the na
tionalists look toward Hitlei as the
leader who will re-establish author
ity at home and respect for the
Reich abroad.
"Communism is dead in Germany.
The main attacks of Hitler are di
rested against the Communists and
the bourgeois class state and not
against the Jews, except in so far as
they are Communist leaders.
"The present treatment of Ger
man Jews is the result of nationalist
agitation during the previous period
of pessimism and despair. In time
the Jewish problem will solve itself."
