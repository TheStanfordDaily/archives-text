# What Will the Commencement Orator Manage to Say This June?
## 
### 
One cannot help bul wonder just wluil commencement
orators sire going to tine! to say to university graduates this
.June. Willi the prospect of unemployment facing nearly
every one of the many thousands scheduled to get their
decrees, the usmil hokum is certain not to pass muster.
No longer is it possible, or even free from the menace
of catcalls, to tell a group of graduates that "the world is
your nut to crack" and "you go forth as the coming lead
ers of the world." Kvery speaker will know all too well
Unit his audience will go forth to disappointment and
chagrin if not privation. He must know, ;ilso, that there
will he litlle chance of the student putting into practice
those things which four years of college have instilled in
his brain.
There is probably no belter time for suggesting that the
college graduate use his enforced leisure in the pursuit
of further education. Certainly the world is over-crowded
with job seekers. A large part of the class of 191 VI is still
unable to lind employment, and the addition of thousands
more will not aid the situation.
Surely education, in itself, is worthy enough to merit
consideration as ;i means of tilling an enforced leisure. If
not suHicient as an end, it at least wiil not detract from
(.nc's future chance of "conquering the world." The time is
coining when the smallest job will require a college degree.
At any rale the situation presents a problem for coin
niencenienl speakers.
