# A 						University Heretic Sees His Heresies Accepted

### 
In light of the recent revision of the I'niversity's en
trance regulations, a statement by Robert Ilutehins, presi
dent of Chicago I'niversity, is of interest.
"I am a heretic on admission requirements," begins Dr.
Ilutehins. "It I bad m\ way, I would admit any student
who could read and write and was recommended by a
reputable person." Dr. Ilutehins was speaking at the an
imal convention of the American Association of Collegiate
Registrars.
"I bis attitude toward entrance requirements is perhaps
typical of that held by many progressive university beads.
I he old-line, hide-bound rules are giving way to a more
liberal viewpoint toward applicants.
In line with Dr. Ilutehins" advanced views on entrance
requirements are his opinions on grades. "The only utilitv
lor grades at the I Diversity of Chicago is for transfer pur
poses ;is an accommodation to oilier institutions which are
not ;is enlightened as we are."' Mis audience was slightly
startled. "Probably within Ihe next few years other uni
versities will follow our lead and Ihe neeessilv for grad
ing will disappear altogether."
IVrhaps ultimately this view will prevail among uni
versities i!i America, but it is highly unlikely that Chicago's
lead will be followed "within Ihe next few years." En
trance requirements seem slated for wholesale loosening
soon, but as for grades liberalism must draw the line
somewhere.
