# Wrestling and Rifle Teams Not Permanently Dinged as Minor Sports
## 
### 
"Don't work ;i willing horse lo death"- that was the
object lesson which enthusiasts for a minor sport and a
would-be minor sport learned recently. Members of the
rifle team, already recognized by the Student Executive
Committee as a second-class minor sport, petitioned for
the patronage and parenthood of the Hoard of Athletic Con
trol, but in vain. (Hose upon the heels of that petition came
one trom wrestling enthusiasts, who sought recognition of
the grappling art as a minor sport. That project was stale
mated ;it lust night's Executive Committee session.
Hut rifle team and wrestling promoters have no cause
for dissatisfaction which might be more than fleeting. The
rifle team's petition to the H.A.C. was rejected merely be
cause of an unfavorable financial situation. The Hoard,
forced to pare its appropriations for already established
sports, both major and minor, had no prejudice against
rifle shooting. It merely made the obvious and inevitably
judicious decision that the undertaking of a new sport en
terprise at such a moment would constitute bad business.
Likewise in the case of wrestling, which was viewed as
prospective minor sport with disfavor about the Ex Com
mittee table. The student group acted very wisely in op
posing sponsorship of a new minor sport which would, of
necessity, have to be run in haphazard fashion without the
patronage of the H.A.C.
