# BULL SESSION

### ABE MELLINKOFF 
It was a list of 17 names that was
given to an elementary political
science class from which the stu
dents were asked to indicate their
choices for the American delegation
to the International Economic Con
ference. It was the customary at
tempt to prove something or other
by a questionnaire; a noble en
deavor. I should have tyeen happy
to have been a member in the class
because my result would have vio
lated the normal curve and would
have been set down us erratum. I
have always wanted to be the er
ratum in such an examination; but
always fall into the normal curve
at the last moment.
I should have selected among
those offered William Z. Foster,
William R Hearst, Hiram Johnson,
A1 Smith, and Charles Dawes. Then
I should write in Peggy Hopkins
Joyce as a harmony delegate. Now
there would be a real delegation.
That aggregation might not bring
home anything- which would put
them in the same class with other
delegations. But they would give the
Conference a show, which is more
than can be said for most half-dozen
delegates to anything.
II might appear that dissension
would break out; but that is mere
superficial deduction. Communist
Foster would be our lead-off man.
"Down with everything," cries Fos
ter. Which is immediately taken by
that crafty diplomatic bunch to
mean that the United States favors
the lowering of tariffs, debts, armies,
and the gold standard. A perfect
formula for the world depression.
Everybody is elated. Foster is taken
out; bought a new suit of clothes;
given a limousine; and returns to

| the Conference to announce that he
! will run on the Republican ticket in
1 1936.
"America Firs|," sound off the
harmony twins, Hearst and John
son. "Why not?" say the French.
"You are our guests." They pass
j the wine goblet to Hearst. But the
publisher is not satisfied, "America
First, Last, and Always," he bel
lows. The French ambassador hands
him the whole bottle. "Will France
pay?" queries Johnson with a cyni
cal smile. "For a whole case of the
stuff," is the certain reply. "France
will not repudiate; France will not
repudiate," cry Hearst and Johnson
in glee. The duo fly off to the tele
graph station to make the midnight
edition. America must learn that
I foreign entanglements have un
tangled. — EXCLUSIVE IN THE
EXAMINER.

The Happy Warrior jumps to his
feet. "As I said in 1928, 1929, 1930,
and every year thereafter, including
1932, what about Mabel Walker
Willebrandt?" The Italians are
strong for keeping women in the
home. Smith agrees, and seconds
the motion to send all prohibitionists
to the Virgin Islands. In return for
I some New York City shipping eon
tracts, Germany suggests singing
"The Sidewalks of New York," and
everybody is happy for a moment.
"Hell and Maria," groans Dawes,
placing his pipe in his mouth for
the ever-ready photographers. "Just
call me Peggy," coos Joyce; and in
the best (Mae) Western manner,
"You are so big and handsome,
Charlie." "Hell and Peggy," returns
Dawes, and the Conference ends—
a grand success.

"America Firs|," sound off the
harmony twins, Hearst and John
son. "Why not?" say the French.
"You are our guests." They pass
j the wine goblet to Hearst. But the
publisher is not satisfied, "America
First, Last, and Always," he bel
lows. The French ambassador hands
him the whole bottle. "Will France
pay?" queries Johnson with a cyni
cal smile. "For a whole case of the
stuff," is the certain reply. "France
will not repudiate; France will not
repudiate," cry Hearst and Johnson
in glee. The duo fly off to the tele

edition. America must learn that

The Happy Warrior jumps to his

and every year thereafter, including
1932, what about Mabel Walker
Willebrandt?" The Italians are
strong for keeping women in the
home. Smith agrees, and seconds
the motion to send all prohibitionists
to the Virgin Islands. In return for
I some New York City shipping eon
tracts, Germany suggests singing
"The Sidewalks of New York," and
everybody is happy for a moment.
"Hell and Maria," groans Dawes,
placing his pipe in his mouth for
the ever-ready photographers. "Just
call me Peggy," coos Joyce; and in
the best (Mae) Western manner,
"You are so big and handsome,
Charlie." "Hell and Peggy," returns
Dawes, and the Conference ends—
a grand success.

CONFERENCING WITII A KICK
It was a list of 17 names that was
given to an elementary political
science class from which the stu
dents were asked to indicate their
choices for the American delegation
to the International Economic Con
ference. It was the customary at
tempt to prove something or other
by a questionnaire; a noble en
deavor. I should have tyeen happy
to have been a member in the class
because my result would have vio
lated the normal curve and would
have been set down us erratum. I
have always wanted to be the er
ratum in such an examination; but
always fall into the normal curve
at the last moment.
I should have selected among
those offered William Z. Foster,
William R Hearst, Hiram Johnson,
A1 Smith, and Charles Dawes. Then
I should write in Peggy Hopkins
Joyce as a harmony delegate. Now
there would be a real delegation.
That aggregation might not bring
home anything- which would put
them in the same class with other
delegations. But they would give the
Conference a show, which is more
than can be said for most half-dozen
delegates to anything.
II might appear that dissension
would break out; but that is mere
superficial deduction. Communist
Foster would be our lead-off man.
"Down with everything," cries Fos
ter. Which is immediately taken by
that crafty diplomatic bunch to
mean that the United States favors
the lowering of tariffs, debts, armies,
and the gold standard. A perfect
formula for the world depression.
