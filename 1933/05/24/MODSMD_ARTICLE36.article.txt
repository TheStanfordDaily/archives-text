LLOYD S. THOMPSON—A note in
appreciation.
Lloyd S. Thompson, drama critic
of the San Francisco Examiner, who
| is to take part in an informal dis
-1 cussion at a meeting of the English
' Club tonight, is, so far as I can see,
i the one San Francisco critic to have
I accepted press-agent rule with a
| becoming grace.
Impossible to escape, as distress
' ing as it is, this tyrannous and blind
! tradition has emasculated most of
American theatre comment. The
: only escape from it is an outward
: resignation followed by evasive
; criticism, the only power of which
' is to damn with faint praise.
There is almost no opportunity
I for criticism to do more than synop
j size, piling adjective upon adjective
j upon adjective until all lose mean-
I ing and sense. Analysis is all but
j unknown, evaluation is lost in the
I 1 ush to make early editions. Even
j the weekly sections devoted to
J drama must be cluttered with syn

! dicated chatter and countless inter- j
views, as boring to critics as stars.
The critic in America has, except i
in a few of the larger metropolitan '
| centers, lost all dignity and, sadly j
enough, all value. The discriminat- 1
| ing playgoer finds the alleged criti- '
c-ism undependable and the custom
ary matinee ladies, if they read it,
remain unmoved and hurry off to
see the play not because it is good
or bad but because it stars someone
with a reputation for wearing beau
tiful gowns, or accomplishing se
ductions with the bored ease of ex-
I perience.
And these are a few of the rea
sons why Thompson's quietly sa
tiric understatement and unexpected
| analysis reveal him as a critic of
i sensibility, unwilling to resign him
self either to flat, unexplained ad
; jective or prolonged detail of plot.
He maintains a dignity above the
tyranny of enforced custom. His ad
jective-control alone deserves an
appreciative epitaph in this burial
! alive. —Sandoe
