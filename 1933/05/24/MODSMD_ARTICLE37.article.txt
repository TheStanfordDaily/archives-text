### OLD DR. ALGAR 
OMAHA—Dr. C. O. Simpson, pro
fessor of radiodontia at Washington
University, St. Louis, says he la
ments the social decline of the
toothpick.
"Hardy pioneers," he said, "picked
their teeth with bowie knives. The
elite of the '80's carried folding gold
toothpicks and within the past
twenty years toothpicks were quite
generally served in homes and at
public eating places. Now they are
confined to primitive rural com
munities, restaurants, and dining
cars."—News item.
To follow a platter of rations
Willi toothpicks and manipulations
Is clearly to point out one's station
And ruin a good reputation.
