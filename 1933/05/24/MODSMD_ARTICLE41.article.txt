The Editor, Sir:
The recent editorial in the Daily
suggesting abolition of the grade
system is to be commended as an
effort to bring to the attention of
the University administration the
clear need for a revaluation of our
grade policies.
The double purpose of grades is
obvious: they further the ambition
of the student arid press him to
work when otherwise he might re
chne, and they offer a means of
classification on the basis of ability
and knowledge.
Insofar as they further ambition
their ultimate effect is detrimental.
True, they force a polishing of de
tails and study to the extensive
scope required, but at what a price
is this "knowledge secured! "Se
cured" so that the mind becomes a
haven for isolated ideas and incom
prehensible fragments—a vessel
filled with ill-digested notions. The
premium is against clear thinking.
The premium acts to suppress what
ever spontaneous interest would
lead to really profitable study.
This line of argument of course
applies much less to "reasoning"
courses and much more to the
"memory" type. But one must en
roll for both sorts, and even for the
former the heated competitive spirit
engendered reduces the possibility
of calm reflection and unhurried ef
fort.
This sort of forced study for
which grades are responsible makes
inevitable the feeling that study is
a painful process to be avoided
whenever possible. Is it likely an
A student thoroughly imbued with
this notion will continue his studi
ous pursuits after college? Will col
lege fully have served the purpose
of whetting his intellectual appe
tite?

Do grades offer a fairly reliable
means of classification? Insofar as
they are derived from reasoning
courses, yes. Those gained in mem
cry courses have a negative worth.
A large hodge-podge of facts is an
indication of Jimited knowledge,
simply because the word "knowl
edge" implies permanency of own
ership and a utility in application.
But *hy classification? To deter
mine whether a continuance of edu
cational facilities should be afford
ed? A good reason, but the classifi
cation for this purpose need be only
between those who may and those
who may not continue. Plus and
minus grading answers this pur
pose.
More elaborate classification is
perhaps desirable among those stu
dents seeking entrance to certain
graduate schools; Grades may be the
rule in those undergraduate courses
which are necessarily the haunts of
certain kinds of prospective gradu
ate students, provided these courses
be not of the memory variety,
That the grade system fills a dis
tinct need in graduate study or in
the high school is neither denied
nor affirmed, but it seems quite evi
dent that, except for certain minor
reservations indicated, the system
could well be culled out of the un
degraduate division.

The Editor, Sir:
The recent editorial in the Daily
suggesting abolition of the grade
system is to be commended as an
effort to bring to the attention of
the University administration the
clear need for a revaluation of our
grade policies.
The double purpose of grades is
obvious: they further the ambition
of the student arid press him to
work when otherwise he might re
chne, and they offer a means of
classification on the basis of ability
and knowledge.
Insofar as they further ambition
their ultimate effect is detrimental.
True, they force a polishing of de
tails and study to the extensive
scope required, but at what a price
is this "knowledge secured! "Se
cured" so that the mind becomes a
haven for isolated ideas and incom
prehensible fragments—a vessel
filled with ill-digested notions. The
premium is against clear thinking.
The premium acts to suppress what
ever spontaneous interest would
lead to really profitable study.
