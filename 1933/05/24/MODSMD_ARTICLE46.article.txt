Did You Know—
That Track Manager Tony Franich
is writing a daily column on the
traveling tracksters for the Exam
iner? Probably for revenge on Dink
and the Chronicle. Best known as a
1 übdown artist, Tony writes news
that is clever, well-written, timely.
That there will he little worrying
by the football coaches concerning
their guards? Not with Bill Cor
hus, Ted Kite. Larry Cooke, Bruce
Tarver, Bob O'Connor, Woody
Adams, and Larry Rouble around.
Thai muscle-manipulator, Leo, the
trainer, claims that Bill Miller's- leg
will ha as good as new Saturday?
"But he won't vault over 14 feet 8
inches," insists Leo.
That the Stadium was financed
I y subscription, and that the ori
ginal subscribers, 1200 of them,'
have the right to good Big Game
seats at a- slightly reduced rate
for 15 years?
Or that, when the horseshoe was
closed by building the south end of
•aid Stadium, scrip was sold to ob
tain tho necessary funds? And that
scrip-holders receive, in return for
the scrip which they purchased for
cash, Big Game ducats?
That when Spud Hamilton ap
proached Don Liebendorfer for
news of the 1.C.4-A. boys, Don
said he knew nothing? "What you
can do," said Liebendorfer, "is
telegraph the train."
That Garry Breckner and Dink
Templeton both neglected Dick
Roekaway of Ohio State when
broadcasting the "dope" on Norman
Paul's 1-.'j-[1:11 low hurdle flight down-
South? Roekaway ran 28.8 on Stagg
Field, Chicago, but he was never
given official recognition because he
used starting blocks. Jack Kellar's
implication for 22.7, made since
Rockaway's race, will probably be
accepted, and will supersede the
present accepted world's mark of
2.">-fl.it held by Negro Brookins of
lowa.
And that this Brookins person,
hurdling in about 1024, set his
great mark although he carried
his arms when topping a timber
straight in front and back of him?
That the students at Temple Uni
versity, where Ted Shipkey coached,
had all flags on the campus at half
mast when Shipkey was ousted re
cently along with the school's
president?
That Polo Coach Dick Gordan
is engaged in assisting President
Roosevelt in alleviating the De
pression? Roosevelt's Conserva
tion plan calls for the mobiliza
tion of 150 thousand men at Mon

terey, and the organizing of them
was such a stupendous task that
I lie army was asked to help. Ilenee
(Jordan's departure from the cam
pus; Polo Expert Chuck Chappell
believes that he will return next
fall.
That the Stanford Rugby Club
may get a trip to Australia in the '
summer of 1934 if Harry Maloney's
plans materialize? And the polo
players may travel to Arizona and
New Mexico next year since their
Utah trip was cancelled.
That the sophomores and juniors
will play off the interclass soccer
championship tie this afternoon,
and that your correspondent may
by then know which way he is
going and not score for the op
position.
