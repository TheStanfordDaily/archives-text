# SOPH, JUNIOR SOCCER TEAMS MEET TODAY IN CHAMPIONSHIP BATTLE
## 
### 
Forty-four flying feet gather this
afternoon to fight, race, and kick up
| and clown the Soccer Field in the
1 second fiery battle in deciding the 1
class championship.
Twenty-two of those feet belong
to the juniors who failed to win
from their sophomore adversaries
Monday even after a five-minute
extra period. And fourteen of those
same feet are attached to varsity
men who won their letters against
California's soccer varsities —but
who couldn't prevent the sopho
mores from leading them in Mon
day's game which they only tied in
the last minute of play, 3 to 3.
The sophomore hope is in the feet
which dangle from its forwards, no
tably Gaston Rojas, Chuck Emerick,
and Miguel Gomez, and its half
backs, Doug Kennedy, Rudy Gon- ;
zales, and Waddy White. Its defense
is weak.
If the junior star forwards, espe
cially Art Hearn, Carl Knecht, Sven i
Doddington, or Cy Johnson, get the
ball past the second-year halfbacks, ,

today's game is likely to fall to the
juniors. But if the juniors exhibit
the same lack of skill, during the j
whole game, which they showed
Monday on two free-kick opportuni
ties, the sophs might retain the
championship they won last year.
