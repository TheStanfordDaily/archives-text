# PRINCETON STAR LOOMS AS THREAT TO EASTMAN
## 
### ALBERT GUERARD, JR 
Since Stanford's Ben Eastman is |
still far from the runner that he
was last year, handicapped as he is
by injury, Bill Bonthron of Prince
j ton is likely to prove the outstand
ing competitor in the 1.C.4-A. mid
dle distance races Friday and Sat
urday. Bonthron will be a factor in
the 800. 1500, and perhaps the 3,000
meter runs.
400 METERS—KarI Warner of
Yale and Ed Ablowich of U.S.C. de
, serve favoritism in this race by vir
tue of their membership on the
1932 American Olympic team. War- \
• ner is the faster of the two, Ablo
wich the more powerful. The Tro
jan runner is powerful enough to
survive heats and semi-final races
without fatigue. Warner has gal
loped 48.2 this spring, while Ablo
wich has just shaded 49 flat.
Howard Jones of Pennsylvania,
successor to the great Bill Carr,
was clocked in 47.2 for a 400-meter 1
lap at the Penn Relays, but in flat
races has muddled down to the 49-
second class. Jones should be good
for a third, however, a yard or so
. ahead of Do Baker of Michigan, Lu-
Valle of U.C.L.A.. Tompkins of
U.S.C., and Stanford's A1 Blackman.
A long tradition of Stanford
quarter-milers slowing down badly
in the East would favor LuValle!
and Tompkins, who beat Ablowich
in a 330-yard race last week, to
I beat the Indian runner out of fifth
' place.
800 METERS—What will Ben
Eastman do against Bill Bonthron,
touted as the great distance runner
in Princeton history? Against Yale,
Bonthron won the 800, 1500, and
3,000 meters, each race by a 30-
} ard margin. Unless Eastman shows
remarkable improvement in his final I
workout today, he will be an ex
tremely long shot. Bonthron can be
counted on to run 1:53, about ten
yards better than the Stanford cap
tain expect to run.
Crowding Eastman for that sec
ond place will be Ed Turner (1:53.7),
a member of last year's Olympiy
team who has yet to better 1:56 this
spring. Also competing will be Cor
nell's Joe Mangan, 1.C.4-A. one-1

mile champion, Norman Penrose
Hallowell of Harvard, national
champion at 1500 meters, and the
two U.S.C. runners, Dave Foore and
Ferris Webster.
As a freshman last year, Webster
ran 1:53.5; this spring he is con
sistent at 1:58. Foore's best mark
this year is 1:56.1.
1500 METERS—This race should
be a grand contest between Hallo
well, Bonthron, and Mangan, with
the Princeton runner again favored.
Hallowell is one of the greatest'
competitive athletes in the game,
Bonthron has yet to be extended,
and Mangan's condition is as much
a mystery as that of Eastman, Mil
ler, or Hables, the triumvirate of
injured Stanford stars. Benavidez of
U.S.C. will probably finish just out
of the money, as did Cliff Halstead
three years running.
The 3,000 meter race is wide open.
No Pacific Coast runners will be
contenders.
Four daily air services now oper
ate between London and Paris.

} ard margin. Unless Eastman shows
remarkable improvement in his final I
workout today, he will be an ex
tremely long shot. Bonthron can be
counted on to run 1:53, about ten
yards better than the Stanford cap
tain expect to run.
Crowding Eastman for that sec
ond place will be Ed Turner (1:53.7),
a member of last year's Olympiy
team who has yet to better 1:56 this
spring. Also competing will be Cor
nell's Joe Mangan, 1.C.4-A. one-1

mile champion, Norman Penrose
Hallowell of Harvard, national
champion at 1500 meters, and the
two U.S.C. runners, Dave Foore and
Ferris Webster.
As a freshman last year, Webster
ran 1:53.5; this spring he is con
sistent at 1:58. Foore's best mark
this year is 1:56.1.
1500 METERS—This race should
be a grand contest between Hallo
well, Bonthron, and Mangan, with
the Princeton runner again favored.
Hallowell is one of the greatest'
competitive athletes in the game,
Bonthron has yet to be extended,
and Mangan's condition is as much
a mystery as that of Eastman, Mil
ler, or Hables, the triumvirate of
injured Stanford stars. Benavidez of
U.S.C. will probably finish just out
of the money, as did Cliff Halstead
three years running.
The 3,000 meter race is wide open.
No Pacific Coast runners will be
contenders.
Four daily air services now oper
ate between London and Paris.
Since Stanford's Ben Eastman is |
still far from the runner that he
was last year, handicapped as he is
by injury, Bill Bonthron of Prince
j ton is likely to prove the outstand
ing competitor in the 1.C.4-A. mid
dle distance races Friday and Sat
urday. Bonthron will be a factor in
the 800. 1500, and perhaps the 3,000
meter runs.
400 METERS—KarI Warner of
Yale and Ed Ablowich of U.S.C. de
, serve favoritism in this race by vir
tue of their membership on the
1932 American Olympic team. War- \
• ner is the faster of the two, Ablo
wich the more powerful. The Tro
jan runner is powerful enough to
survive heats and semi-final races
without fatigue. Warner has gal
loped 48.2 this spring, while Ablo
wich has just shaded 49 flat.
Howard Jones of Pennsylvania,
successor to the great Bill Carr,
was clocked in 47.2 for a 400-meter 1
lap at the Penn Relays, but in flat
races has muddled down to the 49-
second class. Jones should be good
for a third, however, a yard or so
. ahead of Do Baker of Michigan, Lu-
Valle of U.C.L.A.. Tompkins of
U.S.C., and Stanford's A1 Blackman.
A long tradition of Stanford
quarter-milers slowing down badly
in the East would favor LuValle!
and Tompkins, who beat Ablowich
in a 330-yard race last week, to
I beat the Indian runner out of fifth
' place.
800 METERS—What will Ben
Eastman do against Bill Bonthron,
touted as the great distance runner
in Princeton history? Against Yale,
Bonthron won the 800, 1500, and
3,000 meters, each race by a 30-
} ard margin. Unless Eastman shows
remarkable improvement in his final I
workout today, he will be an ex
tremely long shot. Bonthron can be
