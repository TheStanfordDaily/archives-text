### 
WASHINGTON, May 23 i/l') â€” A
verdict in store tomorrow, the Sen
ate tonight came to the final chap
ter of the impeachment trial of
Federal Judge Harold Louderback
o[ California, after hearing his own
story from the witness stand.
Louderback said that not a penny
of the fees allowed the receivers
and their attorneys in cases before
him had gone into his pockets in
his five years on the Federal bench.
As he concluded, the defense
rested its fight for "complete exon
eration" on the five counts, all of
which involve the designation of re
ceivers and attorneys and their fees,
and with a brief bit of rebuttal evi
dence, the House prosecution closed.
