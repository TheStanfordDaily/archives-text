The Senate today exonerated Fed
! oval Judge Harold Louderbaek on
I all five counts of a House bill of
impeachment charging him with ir
] regularities in various receivership
cases that came before him in his
! Northern California court.
One by one in rapid succession
(lie Senate voted that the Judge
was mil guilty of the five charges
that the House had brought against
him. The majorities varied on
each vote, hut the closest was 011
the fifth count, a summation of
the first four charges.
This one showed a majority for
the first, time against the San Fran
â€¢ cisco judge, but the tally was far
below the necessary two-thirds to
convict.
In addition to summarizing the
first four counts, the fifth accused
the jurist of conduct "prejudicial to
the dignity of the judiciary" and
with exciting "fear and distrust" of
the courts.
