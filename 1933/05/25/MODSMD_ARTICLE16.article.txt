Praising the advanced educational]
methods of the Soviet children as l
more interesting to world thinkers i
than the communistic experiment, I
Artist, Pedro Lemos, curator of the j
Stanford Museum, lauded the Rus- !
ian Children's School Exhibition
now being shown at the Art Gallery, j
"Compared to the illiterate condi
tions prior to 1917, Russia has ac
complished wonders with her chil- J
dren. Other governments would do i
well to copy her in fostering genius '
and giving gifted children special
attention."
Lemos commented on the genuine ,
creative talent that is displayed by
the young Russians in their paint
inys, drawings, and models, which
are on exhibit.
The children are products of a
n« w method of education which I

combines the practical with the theo
retical, explained Miss Rose Isaak,
in charge of the showing.
''They are the hope of Russia, and
the only privileged class. Everything
is done for their sakes. From baby
hood they are trained in Soviet
ideals. Their reaction to the indus
trialization of the country is re
flected in their creative work."
She pointed out that the majority
of the drawings are of engines and
tools, and showed a brilliantly il
lustrated primer for four-year-olds
cn "The Mechanized Process of
Coal Mining."
The exhibit is being sponsored by
the American Russian Institute
which numbers on its executive
committee Stanford Professors P. A.
Martin, Graham H. Stuart, Henry
Lanz, and H. H. Fisher.
