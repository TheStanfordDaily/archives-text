Men's rushing rules will be al

cording to principles adopted by the
Interfratcrnity Council at its meet
ing last night. Donn Tatum, new
president, who took over the reins
last night, announced that full de- ;
tails would be given in the next j
few days.
Committee reports were heard
on junior transfer, social, and
scholarship problems. A definite
course o.' action in regards to jun
ior transfers is to be undertaken,
the nature of which will also be
given soon, latum, Dan Ellis, and
John Bacon are working on a
method of contacting these men.
The meeting, which was the last I
for the year, completed plans for
the Interfraternity Banquet sched- j
uled for May 31, at which all the j
fraternities will be represented. It is;
expected that President Wilbur and
possibly other men important in the j
University will attend.
Several houses were fined for not j
having representatives present.
Bill Wentworth and Leon Pock- i
man headed the groups which re- !
ported on the .social and scholastic j
problems affecting fraternities.
