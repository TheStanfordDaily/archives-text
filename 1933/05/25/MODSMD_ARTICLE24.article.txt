# Rich Man, Poor Man, Banker-man, Thiefâ€”Next?

There was a timo, some years ago, when parents hoped ;
thai little Johnnie would "row up to he a minister, a law-{
ver, or a hanker. It was comparable to the English idea j
that the C.hurch, the State, or the Army were the only re
spectable professions for a gentleman's son.
In America the minister, the lawyer, and the banker j
lopped the social scale. In the last fifteen or twenty years, i
though, this standard lias changed surprisingly.
The rapid falling away from religion and churches that
has marked post-war America lias taken away much of the
clergyman's prestige. An abundance of shyster barristers, j
criminal defenders, and the like, has robbed the lawyer!
of his old-time standing. Only the banker held his ace
position.
When the business man.look over the leadership of the
social nexus shortly after the war, lie shared honors with
the hanker. Today well, maybe times are hard every
where.
II is obvious that the barren months since October of
has destroyed the country's faith in the business man.
It is becoming rapidly apparent that the same fate lias
overtaken the banker.
The recent succession of unpleasant disclosures about
New York bankers, culminal'ing in yesterday's J. P. Morgan
probe, has put the banker on the same level with the min
ister and the lawyer.
What professions will fake the places of these three in!
the nation's estimation is an interesting problem one
which will be answered mainly by the present decade of
college graduates.
