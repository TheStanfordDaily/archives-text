### 
Over in Hie Administration Huilding there's a lost and
found department supposedly. II was originally designed
as a clearing house for all lost articles. All rumpus centers
the (.ellar, the Bookstore, the 8.A.('., the Postollice, audi
all the rest an 4 supposed to turn in such articles to this j
department. If they are not called for bv the end of the j
quarter the finders may reclaim them.
Hut the idea, simple and logical as it is, hasn't been '
working. Ihe C.ellar runs its own lost and found depart-j
ment. So does the 8.A.C.. The result is a mess. That lost
fountain pen may be in any of a dozen places.
The situation is bad. The remedy is simple. There's one !
regular lost and found department. I'se it.
