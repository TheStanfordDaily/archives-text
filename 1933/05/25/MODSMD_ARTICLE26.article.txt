# An Edit on Lincoln, Which Ends on a Cheering Note

### 
"If Abraham Lincoln had {(one to a modern American
university he would have been ruined. Me would have
learned how to gel grades by taking pipe courses and he
would have learned dirty politics. Me would have been
standardized."
This statement was made some time ago by a professor
in an eastern university. I( is not a new thought in the field i
of education, but il is strange coming from one who is j
active in a modern university.
A university education is an admirable thing in many j
ways, but often its standardizing influence is disastrous. |
For the average man it undoubtedly is advantageous, but
i! certainly would not have been for a great individualist
like Lincoln. The mass gains, but the individual sutlers j
in modern American education.
Taking this fact into consideration, it is a question of
grave doubt whether or not mass education in universities j
is a success. Its alternative, the Oxford system, is as un
certain. In Kngiand the mass is subordinated to Hie indi
vidual.
The best possible solution seems to be found in a com
bination of Hit 4 two. Several eastern universities have
made steps in this direction by standardizing the first two
years and leaving the individual to his own resources in
Ins junior and senior years. The movement is at present
in an experimental stage, but the results are reported as
highly satisfactory.
In any case, modern methods in both England and
America have been lacking in many respects, and, with i
modern educators looking for something better, a new svs
lem will in time arrive.
