# BULL SESSION
## WILBUR MEETS THE STUDENTS 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
President Wilbur is to be con
j gratulated for his discussion of stu
j dent problems with a student com
| mittee the other day. May there be
! many more; and even though they
' pioduce no panaceas or startling
i front page news, they are a distinct
campus asset. There is an all too
common attitude on this and every
campus that there should be a per
petual struggle; between the Ad
i ministration on the one side and
tlit- students on every other side.
It is likened to a baseball game
with the Administration at bat in
ning after inning and game after
I game. The students feel they never
have a chance to come in from right
; field. All they can do is chase the
jfust smashes over the second-base
| man's head. Wilbur has invited the
j students in from the right-field
j waste-lands to the Administrative
i dugout itself—the President's Office.
I
Every .student is sure that he has
j the cure for any campus ill right in
j his jacket pocket. Every university
president has heard those cures
ever since he became president and
a good while before. The chances of
ever picking up something new must
be rare indeed. Every undergradu
ate generation is about as bad as its
predecessor. Sometimes a little
worse.
That is why it is difficult for a
President to listen to students. It is
the same old story over and over

/again for him. He stands little chance
to gain. But Wilbur has had the
students in and talked to them and
j listened to them—the latter being
the important thing. The students
have had their chance at the bat.
The fact that they probably fanned
1 every time is immaterial. Merely an
expected incidental.
It is hoped that President Wilbur
will be able to continue these stu
dent conferences. It will take time
from valuable work. It will not pro
duce results that can be placed on
a balance sheet or mentioned in four
different places in that monumental
' annual—the President's Report. But
' it will create a better spirit on the
i Campus—whatever spirit is.
Then there always is a possibility
—an outside chance that the Presi
dent may stumble upon a worth
-while idea in these meetings. That
is not completely impossible. We
youngsters get excited over what
we think are "injustices." The old
sters are completely injustice-proof.
They expect them; are not disap-
I pointed when they find them; and
as a result do nothing about them.
!
President Wilbur has definite
ideas —which is something in his
favor. Those ideas have made ene
mies—which is to be expected. But
what is unfortunate is that some of
his plans have been woefully twisted
' in the rush of time and antagonism.
! These conferences may unwrinkle
j some of the twists.
