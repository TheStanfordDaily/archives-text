ROMEO ANI) JULIET — Al (he
Marionette Guild, San Francisco.
Despite a new theatre, better
acoustics, and improved equipment,
Ralph Chesse's production of a
minimized "Romeo and Juliet"
proved to be large for him. One
came away with the feeling that
Shakespeare was not for the mari
onette theatre. The illusion of
Shakespeare's lines coming from the
mouths of marionettes strikes one
as very nearly ludicrous. The illu
sion could never be complete, as it
has been in several of Chesse's pro
ductions, even though the interpre
tation of' lines had been perfect.
And that it was not. Perhaps this
was due to the necessity of reading
lines, and at the same time manipu
lating the puppets.
Cheese himself undertook the al
most unbelievable task of reading
four parts: Romeo, Tybalt, Peter,
artd Friar Laurence. As a result of
this, his reading of any of them
was unfinished. His Romeo was more
of a Hamlet —melancholy and brood
ing, bringing none of the fire into
the part that is necessary—whining
at all times. His Tybalt was nothing
more than a reading. His Peter was
the best of the foul". Fri#r Laurence
was almost another Tybalt, which
once or twice slipped over into
Peter.
Juliet, read by Barbara Allen,
was a poor Juliet to a poor Rorfteo.
She read her scenes in the same
affected tone throughout. Charles
Bratt, reading Mereutio and Capu
let, made them much too similar to
distinguish.
Crawford Perks, in the parts of
Benvolio and Balthazar, was the

! same in both, but unobtrusive. Paris,
and the Apothecary, the Nurse and
Lady Capulet were poorly done. Bob
Southwick, who read the former
two, showed no study nor under
j standing of the lines. Mareelle
: Chesse, who read the latter ones,
sounded like a small girl with a
very youthful voice, trying to act
; grown-up.
The sets were not brilliantly done,
though they were far more satis
fying than any other portion of the
shew. And the costumes were good, j
! buf ordinary. We can only hope that ■
Chesse will, in the future, leave
Shakespeare to those more capable
of handling such a task. ■ —Salt
