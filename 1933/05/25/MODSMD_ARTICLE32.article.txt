"If the courts were to exclude
! books from sale merely because
; they might incite lust, in disordered
I minds our entire literature would

Ily t'.mall number of uninteresting
j and barren books."—New York

And, Judge, if classics weary you
We'll let you borrow Ballyhoo.

And daily plan behind our backs
