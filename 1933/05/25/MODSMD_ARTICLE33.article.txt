(From two articles 011 the same
page of the S.F. Examiner)
"San Francisco lacks stimuli for
the spiritual and emotional faculties.
This was among the reasons given
by San Francisco public school
teachers in explanation of their re
luctance to live in the city that pays
their salaries."
"Setting forth the many and varied
attractions of San Francisco, a new
booklet was issued yesterday by
Californians, Inc. It will be used to
answer the questions of prospective
tourists and residents."
