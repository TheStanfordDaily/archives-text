## Altruists Trying to Slice a Melon 
### 
Some wi.se contemporary philoso
pher must some time have said,
"Money makes the modern world
go 'round."
Yes, and money makes the Board
of Athletic Control turn .somersaults.
There was a time, forgotten by
most, in the gay, happy years of
yore, when the B.A.C. had lots of
money. Glistening, precious silver
dollars many of them. Money to
build Pavilions; money to taxi foot
ball players; money to raise salaries;
money to burn.
And there is a time, most sadly
remembered by all, when the B.A.C.
is broke. That time is the present.
The Board's income, derived almost
wholly from football, is now the
Board's outgo, spent on everything.
Paradoxically uniting business
acumen and altruism toward Stan
ford, the Board has been forced to
curtail expenses. And yet the Board
has desired not to curtail the activi
ties it supports.
Working, Iherefore, to help Stan
ford by the conservation of both red
ink and the present athletic status,
'he Board has slashed the salaries
of its employees. It has reorganized
its financial department; it has re
duced the allowances to minor
sports; it has obliterated the most
flagrant financial abuses bv the ma
jor .sports; it has re-budgeted all its
enterprises.
Not because it is helping itself but
because it is trying to help Stanford,
the Board is snooping around to un
cover and destroy wasteful expenses.
And yet, still the B.A.C. is losing
money. This year's revenue was far
below the minimum estimate that a
majority of the Board-members last
tail considered ridiculously small.
The Golf Course is not paying for
itself, after two profitable years; gate
receipts for everything have fallen
oil; the rugby income went to char
ity.
The Board does not wish further
to reduce minor sports allowances.
It cannot save much from its own
office expenditures. Another salary
cut would be unfair. Intramural
sports need every cent of their ap
propriation. Which means that, un
less these bled sources must suffer
still more, major sports must grin ,
and bear it.
And the sardonic humor in the ,
whole situation is that a gigantic cut
in major sports allowances would
hurt no one.
But horrors of horrors, I hear
whispered. Suppose that the football
players were given fewer banquets.
Suppose that the basketball men
were forcer to wear year-old sweat
suits. Suppose that the training
room supported less tape and less
help and fewer minor injuries. And,
worst of all. suppose that the track
.ster* even had to purchase their
own shoes.
Harmless "supposes," all of them.
•And some day those suppositions
will become realities. But just now.
the Board can't make such most
necessary reductions. And the sim
ple reason is that howls, from you
Mid I, from coaches and alumni,
would greet such an action.
Oi course, if we were rational and
jenerous and therefore most un
human, we would ourselves give to
the B.A.C. the knife with which to
make a slice in the juicy major
. ports melon. We would alvocate J
.Mich action and the howls would be
di owned in our chorus of assent.
Some day, unless the Stadium is
packed at next fall's Big Game with
live-dollar ticket-holders, the cut
will come. And it can come now, I
when it is most needed, if you and [
1 realize that the B.A.C. is working I
for us and that major sports waste
a hell of a lot of money.

But horrors of horrors, I hear
whispered. Suppose that the football
players were given fewer banquets.
Suppose that the basketball men
were forcer to wear year-old sweat
suits. Suppose that the training
room supported less tape and less
help and fewer minor injuries. And,
worst of all. suppose that the track
.ster* even had to purchase their
own shoes.
Harmless "supposes," all of them.
•And some day those suppositions
will become realities. But just now.
the Board can't make such most
necessary reductions. And the sim
ple reason is that howls, from you
Mid I, from coaches and alumni,
would greet such an action.
Oi course, if we were rational and
jenerous and therefore most un
human, we would ourselves give to
the B.A.C. the knife with which to
make a slice in the juicy major

.Mich action and the howls would be
di owned in our chorus of assent.
Some day, unless the Stadium is
packed at next fall's Big Game with
live-dollar ticket-holders, the cut
will come. And it can come now, I
when it is most needed, if you and [

for us and that major sports waste
a hell of a lot of money.

Some wi.se contemporary philoso
pher must some time have said,
"Money makes the modern world
go 'round."
Yes, and money makes the Board
of Athletic Control turn .somersaults.
There was a time, forgotten by
most, in the gay, happy years of
yore, when the B.A.C. had lots of
money. Glistening, precious silver
dollars many of them. Money to
build Pavilions; money to taxi foot
ball players; money to raise salaries;
money to burn.
And there is a time, most sadly
remembered by all, when the B.A.C.
is broke. That time is the present.
The Board's income, derived almost
wholly from football, is now the
Board's outgo, spent on everything.
Paradoxically uniting business
acumen and altruism toward Stan
ford, the Board has been forced to
curtail expenses. And yet the Board
has desired not to curtail the activi
ties it supports.
Working, Iherefore, to help Stan
ford by the conservation of both red
ink and the present athletic status,
'he Board has slashed the salaries
of its employees. It has reorganized
its financial department; it has re
duced the allowances to minor
sports; it has obliterated the most
flagrant financial abuses bv the ma
jor .sports; it has re-budgeted all its
enterprises.
Not because it is helping itself but
because it is trying to help Stanford,
the Board is snooping around to un
cover and destroy wasteful expenses.
And yet, still the B.A.C. is losing
money. This year's revenue was far
below the minimum estimate that a
majority of the Board-members last
tail considered ridiculously small.
The Golf Course is not paying for
itself, after two profitable years; gate
receipts for everything have fallen
oil; the rugby income went to char
ity.
The Board does not wish further
to reduce minor sports allowances.
It cannot save much from its own
office expenditures. Another salary
cut would be unfair. Intramural
sports need every cent of their ap
propriation. Which means that, un
less these bled sources must suffer
still more, major sports must grin ,
and bear it.
And the sardonic humor in the ,
whole situation is that a gigantic cut
in major sports allowances would
hurt no one.
