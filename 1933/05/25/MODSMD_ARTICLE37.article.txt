# '35 Soccermen Down Juniors, 2-1
## SOPHOMORE TEAM RENEWS HOLD ON INTERCLASS TITLE 
### 
Led by Miguel Gomez, who found
the net twice to give his team a
winning margin, the Class of '35
defeated the juniors 2 to 1 yesterday
and retained the interclass soccer
title for another year.
Bang-up play by the sophomore
halfback trio of Doug Kennedy,
Kudy Gonzales, and Waddy While
held the juniors at a disadvantage
during the major part of the contest.

Gomez tallied first near the close
of the opening half when he took
a short pass from Rapf and slipped
the ball past goalie King of the
juniors. %
The Class of '34 came back in the
second half with a determined push
against the sophs' 1-0 lead, and
scored after a deadly shot by Art
Hearn. The score hung at 1-1 for a
few short minutes and then Gomez
uncorked the best individual play
of the afternoon. Taking the ball
near midfield, he side-stepped a lone
path through the junior defense for
a close-in shot,
The juniors rallied strong for the
finish and were constantly swarm
ing all over the sophomore goal.
Exceptional work by Newman at
goal for the winners saved the day
for '35.
