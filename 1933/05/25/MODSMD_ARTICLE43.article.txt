By ALBERT GUERARD, JR.

High jump, broad jump, and pole
vault strength in the 1.C.4-A. meet
Friday and Saturday is fairly evenly
divided between Atlantic and Pa
i ific Coast teams.
U.S.C., greatest threat to Stan
ford's hopes of winning the meet, is
strong in all three jumping events,
although Eastern stars may match
the Trojans, point-for-point.
!!K;5l JUMP—Bob Von Osdel of
U.S.C. Ls defending champion, since
the man with whom he tied for first
last year, O'Connor of Columbia,
has graduated. Von Osdel is still
below his 1932 par, however, having
dropped one decision to Stanford's
Lloyd Schween. Olympic Champion
Duncan McNaughton will be at
tempting a comeback. All of his
jumps this spring have been medi
ocre.
Jumping skyward in honor of the
East are five springly youths, Keith
Brown of Yale, George Spitz of New
Yory University, holder of the in
door world's record, Bob Pitkin of
Columbia, and a negro, Howard
Spencer of Geneva College. This
event is all guesswork. On the basis
ol 1933 jumping the men should
finish like this: Brown. Spitz, Von
O-del, Spencer, Pitkin, and Schween.
BROAD JUMP—Only two Eastern
jumpers challenge Western suprem
acy in this event: McNally of Holy
Cross, and Spitz, the high-jumper.
McNally has soared beyond 24 feet,
but he is extremely inconsistent.
Favored to win will be Norman
Paul of U.S.C., with most of the
competition furnished by his team
mates Gilbert and McFadden, and
Phil Williams and Paul Zaches of
Stanford. A consensus of opinion
sees it this way: Paul, Williams,
McNally, McFadden, and Zaches.
The latter has much trouble ac
quainting himself with unfamiliar
take-ofT boards.
POLE VAULT—Three men tied
for first last year at 13 feet, 10
inches: Thompson of Yale, Graber
of U.S.C., and Miller of Stanford.
Since that meet Miller won the
Olympic pole-vault championship,
after finishing second best to Gra-

her at the national championship
meet. This spring, Thompson, and his
teammate Keith Brown, more re
cently a high-jumper, have been
going like pole-vaulters afire. They
have both exceeded fourteen feet
four Umes. Miller will be out of
first-place consideration this week
end, stricken by an ankle injury
that was aggravated anew at the
P.A.A. meet last. Saturday. A' so
vaulting will be a third Yale man,
Peirce, George Jefferson of U.C.L.A.,
Bud Deacon of Stanford, as well as
several 13 feet, 6 inch performers.
Graber, Thompson, Brown, Dea
con, and Peirce is a good guess.
ROME, May 24 (/Pi—Premier Mus
solini, on horseback, inspected 40,000
yc ung Fascists today, reviewing a
parade several miles long.
Work is often the father of pleas
ure—Voltaire.
