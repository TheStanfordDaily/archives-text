# ALUSTIZA, ROUBLE STAR AS CARDS GO THROUGH WORKOUT
## 
### Oliver Johnston, Jr 
Frankie Alustiza ran off with the
honors in scrimmage yesterday, and,
incidentally, ran off with the ball
most of the time, too.
Alustiza was practically unstop
pableâ€”shoving his way through the
line and outrunning the secondary
defense. He was instrumental in |
scbring three touchdowns.
Alflerbaugh in Form
Kenny Afflerbaugh was another
prominent figure yesterday. Playing
quarter on the same team as Frank,
ho slashed off some nice gains.
Chuck White and Paul Targhetta
finished out the backfield. Targhetta
made a nice run after receiving a
pass, being assisted by excellent
blocking from White.
Rouble Steals Show
This team scored three touch
downs and would have scored more
if it had not been for Mr. Rouble
at guard. Strongly supported by
Calloway at tackle and Topping at
end, he had his hands on the ball
carrier every time the play came
on his side of the line
On the other team Ray Todd and
Bill Sim were instrumental on the
' offense. "Workhorse" Todd is im-
I proving with every scrimmage.
Ed Lettunich did good work on
! defense. There doesn't seem to be 1
anybody that can keep him from
smashing through.
Lawson Injured
Monk Moscrip made some nice
tackles and charged in so fast that
he ipped a good many plays in the
bud. Alf Brandin and Wes Muller
both looked good at the center jobs.
Stan Anderson is still out with an
i injured knee, and Bob Maentz and
A1 Norgard are nursing ailments.
Jim Lawson, line coach, received a
severe knee injury the other day
when he got in the path of some big
huskies during scrimmage.
