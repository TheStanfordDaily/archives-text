# Tigers Ready For Card Tilt
## 
### 
Prospects that the Princeton-Car
dinal tennis duel back East in Ger
mantown this year might assume
large proportions was assured last
week-end when Princeton won ihe
mythical championship of the East.
Always noted for famous teams,
the Tigers were no exception this
year. The invitation they extended
to Sammy Lee and Joe Coughlih
was accepted soon after the B.A.C.
decided to send the two men back
for the intereollegiates.
By winning consecutively over
Yale, Dartmouth, and Williams in
the last two weeks, the Princeton
netmen not only went through their
entire season undefeated, but de
feated the major teams of the East
ern colleges.
Lee and Coughlin have been prac
ticing almost daily for the past two
weeks. Each is playing good tennis
at this time, and an additional week
of practice in the East, getting ac
customed to- the grass courts, will
help their chances.
There is a strong possibility that
as a doubles team the Card netmen
may reach at least the semi-final
rounds. Their smooth play together
on the coast this season proved that
they could step onto the throne oc
cupied by Coughlin and Gledhill
last year.
