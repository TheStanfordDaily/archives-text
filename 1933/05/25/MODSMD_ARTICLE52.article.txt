GENEVA, May 24 (/Piâ€”The anti- j
war machinery which the United '
States is helping to construct took j
definite form in the disarmament j
conference today when Norman H.
Davis announced the Washington j
Government was prepared to con- j
fer with other powers whenever the 1
Briand-Kellogg pact has been vio- I
lated.
If it is possible to identify the ag- ,
gressor, Davis, the American Am- !
bassador-at-Large, said, the United
States Government undertakes to !
refrain from any action likely to j
defeat the concerted efforts of other
nations to deal with the offending
state.
