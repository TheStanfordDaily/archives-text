## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 24 (/P)- ,
Hie trial of Tom Mooney on an old
murder indictment in connection
with the 1916 Preparedness Day']
bombing outrage came to an abrupt '
end today when Superior Judge
Louis Ward directed a verdict for |
acquittal.' %
This dramatic action of the court
followed Mooney's pleading against
a motion of an unwilling prosecutor
for a directed verdict.
Judge Ward advised the jury to
acquit, saying that the outcome
would have no practical value in
(lie absence of prosecution testi
mony.
He informed the jurors that they
need not necessarily follow his
recommendations, but ordered the ;
clerk to prepare a verdict of ac
quittal. The six men and six women j
chosen during the two days of
maneuvering between the prosecu
tion and defense retired, signed the
verdict immediately, and were dis
charged, all in the matter of a min
ute or two.
