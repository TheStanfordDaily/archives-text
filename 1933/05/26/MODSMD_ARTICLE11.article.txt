# Paly Demands Vote On Beer
## 
### 
In another attempt to legalize 3.2
beer in Palo Alto, petitions bearing
1150 signatures were placed on file
in the office of the city clerk yes
terday, asking that an election be
called within GO days.
The purpose of the vote would
be to submit a proposed amend
ment to the city charter and or
dinances, for the purpose* of
changing the local prohibition to
"intoxicating" liquor rather than
"alcoholic."
The sponsors of the wet movement
hope that this will clear the way
for legalization, since the congres
sional definition of the new beer is
"non-intoxicating."
Adron Beene, attorney for the pe
tioners, who failed in recent efforts
to admit 3.2, requested that the
amendment be included on the spe
cial state prohibition ballot on June
27.
