# HANSEN PLANS FINAL DRIVE IN QUAD SELLING
## Only 100 Copies Remain To Be Sold Before Drive Closes Thursday 
### 
A Quad Sales Week to climax the
year's campaign was announced
yesterday by Ray Hansen, editor.
The drive, starting today, will con
tinue until next Thursday when
distribution of the Quads will begin
at 1 o'clock in the Union.
With less than 100 copies of the
1933 yearbook still available, the
drive is being made in an effort to
insure financial success this year,
which necessitates the sale of these
last copies. They are $6 apiece and
if not reserved by Thursday will be
sold at the Stanford Bookstore.
The editor's award, given an
nually to the most outstanding
freshman on the staff was won
this year by Katherine Fuller,
Hansen announced yesterday.
Catherine Cromclin was the run
ner-up. The award consists of a
Quad with the winner's name en
graved on the cover in gold letters.
Special emphasis is placed on
sports in this edition. The football
and track sections have been ex
tended editorially as well as pic
torially, with good action shots in'
addition to individual pictures of
the athletes. There are two pencil
drawings, "Farewell Pop," and
"Hello Tiny," by Richard Stevens,
noted San Francisco artist.
Many Campus Views
The view section, always a spe
cial Quad feature, has been extended
three pages this year. The views of
familiar campus sights arc depicted
in buff crayon drawings underlaid
by tint blocks and printed on special
India colored paper.
