### HELEN HAMBLETON 
Stanford, the school of wealth?
Emphatically no. The roster of Uni
versity scholarships speaks not well
for the Farm. Stanford assumes a
lowly place when its $10,000, the
yearly amount for award, is com
pared with Yale's $515,000 annual
fund for student grants.
During the depression Stanford
scholarship funds have sulTered as
well as its endowment. In the last
three years the donors of ten schol
arships have found themselves un
able to continue payments. Of course
the Newell and Burns funds have
been started during this period, but
the first is limited to students from
Utah and the second to women,
preferably those just entering.
Recently the scholarships for
graduates were awarded. For each
one to be given, there were 12 ap

plicants. This year there are .144 un
dergraduate applicants for whom
there is a total of 25 scholarships.
Stanford has been fortunate in the
donations for scholarships that it has
had, for they are relatively unre
stricted, making for fairer distribu
; tion.
At tiic meeting of the Senior Class
it was voted to use the money
pledged by members of the class,
, which has gone to a general endow
ment fund in former years, for a
scholarship fund. Members of the
class thought that they would rather
have their money help a student,
thus using it for a definite purpose.
The amount of this new fund will
depend on the size and number of
pledges made by the members of the
Class of '33 in the campaign to be
, conducted next week.
