# Cards And Trojans Polish Spikes For I.C.-4A. Showdown
## Experts Pick Stanford to Win Annual Intercollegiate Meet at Cambridge; Preliminaries Today; Finals Contested Tomorrow 
### Albert Guerard, Jr 
DOSTON, May 25 (A.P. Late Dispatch)— Adoption of the metric system
for measurement of track events, to he used for the first time in 57
years by the 1.C.4-A. at the championship meet, starting tomorrow, was
condemned tonight by a majority ol" members of the track coaches' associa
tion of America. On motion by Dink Templeton the coaches voted 22 to .'5
in opposition to the metric standard and in favor ofrestoring the traditional
linear measure.
Templeton charged the metric system was "railroaded" through the
1.C.4-A. Most of the coaches also supported the Stanford representative's

»assertion, l, lt was a mistake to wipe
out the time-honored and historic
achievements from the books."
This was the second time the
coaches have expressed themselves
in favor of yards instead of the
I metric system.

Nine months of constant effort
come to an ironically mocking cli
max today and tomorrow, when
Stanford's injury-ridden track team
attempts to wrest from U.S.C.'s
1 sound-and-healthy warriors the
1.C.4-A. track championship which
has been won by the Trojans for
the last three years. Fifteen men
from Stanford, including a quartet
injured world-beaters, 18 stal
warts from U.S.C., and 53 stars from
Yale, are expected to divide all the
! spoils iu the finals tomorrow. Ex
i perls throughout the country are
I picking the teams to finish in that
order: Stanford, U.S.C., Yale.
Those same experts, whose badge
I of favoritism Ls placed unwanted on
11lie shoulders of Dink Templeton
and his 15 Indians, declare that
! Stanford will score upward of 60
points, putting Southern California
down for about 55, and Yale be
tween 20 and 25. With a watchful
j and conservative eye on the crush
ing injuries of Captain Ben East
man, Bill Miller, Bud Deacon, and
I Les Habies, mentor Templeton puf.s
42 points as the Stanford maximum.
He hopes that number will be
i enough to win.
Templeton Pessimistic
From a 3500-mile
jTtmpleton's prediction seems un
\ reasonably pessimistic. A chart out
j lining the strict minimum Stanford
I can score (Eastman unplaced, Mot
; tram third; Meier third, etc.) gives
Stanford 33 points. Another chart,
stretching every Indian athlete's po
tentialtities to the utmost, shows 72
j tallies.
A compromise estimate claims th<t.
Stanford and U.S.C. will both score
between 52 and 58, with the distri
bution iu this six-point leeway de-
I ciding the meet.
One factor is certain: Stanford's
2-1 favoritism in Eastern betting
ciicles is unjustified. The meet is
an absolute toss-up, and should not
be regarded in any other light.
What must Stanford do to win?
Habies in Shape?
j Student-manager Leslie "Abe"
' Habies must take at least eight
t points in the dashes, a second in
j each event or a first and a third.
| Captain Eastman must shave at least
four seconds from the 1:59 time he
turned in at the P.A.A. 800 meters
last Saturday, so that he can gain
j third place. An Eastman victory over
Princeton's Bill Bonthron is not, in
j conceivable, but a complete failure
to place is also possible.
i Eastman will be running his last
race for Stanford, barring the
N.C.A.A. 800 meters in June. If de
tenu inat ion and very doubtful con
dition can be balanced, and still
spell victory, Stanford is assured
fivi points in the 800 meters. No
question about the determination!
Captain-elect (Jus Meier and
Colto Herbert must take at least
eight points in the hurdles . . .
Phil Williams must cop a second
in the broad jump . . . One of
Stanford's injured vaultcrs must
grab off a fourth place, which
means reaching 13 feet, <i inches
. . . Stanford's strong-arm quartet
must not fall down, thereby earn
ing from 20 to 2(i points in the
shot and discus, and Johnny Mot
tram, a great competitor, must
out-javelin Worntz of Colgate and
McKcnzic of U.S.C., both veterans.
If the weather is fine; if the
muscles arc okeh; if
KFRC will join the Columbia
Broadcasting System on Saturday
in bringing the finals of the meet
across the country, from 11:15 to 1
o'clock, Pacific Coast time. There
will be no broadcast of the pre
liminaries today.

DOSTON, May 25 (A.P. Late Dispatch)— Adoption of the metric system
for measurement of track events, to he used for the first time in 57
years by the 1.C.4-A. at the championship meet, starting tomorrow, was
condemned tonight by a majority ol" members of the track coaches' associa
tion of America. On motion by Dink Templeton the coaches voted 22 to .'5
in opposition to the metric standard and in favor ofrestoring the traditional
linear measure.
Templeton charged the metric system was "railroaded" through the
1.C.4-A. Most of the coaches also supported the Stanford representative's

»assertion, l, lt was a mistake to wipe
out the time-honored and historic
achievements from the books."
This was the second time the
coaches have expressed themselves
in favor of yards instead of the
I metric system.

come to an ironically mocking cli
max today and tomorrow, when
Stanford's injury-ridden track team
attempts to wrest from U.S.C.'s
1 sound-and-healthy warriors the
1.C.4-A. track championship which
has been won by the Trojans for
the last three years. Fifteen men
from Stanford, including a quartet
injured world-beaters, 18 stal
warts from U.S.C., and 53 stars from
Yale, are expected to divide all the
! spoils iu the finals tomorrow. Ex
i perls throughout the country are
I picking the teams to finish in that
order: Stanford, U.S.C., Yale.
Those same experts, whose badge
I of favoritism Ls placed unwanted on
11lie shoulders of Dink Templeton
and his 15 Indians, declare that
! Stanford will score upward of 60
points, putting Southern California
down for about 55, and Yale be
tween 20 and 25. With a watchful
j and conservative eye on the crush

man, Bill Miller, Bud Deacon, and

out the time-honored and historic
achievements from the books."
This was the second time the
coaches have expressed themselves
in favor of yards instead of the
I metric system.

Nine months of constant effort
come to an ironically mocking cli
max today and tomorrow, when
Stanford's injury-ridden track team
attempts to wrest from U.S.C.'s
1 sound-and-healthy warriors the
1.C.4-A. track championship which
has been won by the Trojans for
the last three years. Fifteen men
from Stanford, including a quartet
injured world-beaters, 18 stal
warts from U.S.C., and 53 stars from
Yale, are expected to divide all the
! spoils iu the finals tomorrow. Ex
i perls throughout the country are
I picking the teams to finish in that
order: Stanford, U.S.C., Yale.
Those same experts, whose badge
I of favoritism Ls placed unwanted on
11lie shoulders of Dink Templeton
and his 15 Indians, declare that
! Stanford will score upward of 60
points, putting Southern California
down for about 55, and Yale be
tween 20 and 25. With a watchful
j and conservative eye on the crush
ing injuries of Captain Ben East
man, Bill Miller, Bud Deacon, and
I Les Habies, mentor Templeton puf.s
42 points as the Stanford maximum.
He hopes that number will be
i enough to win.
Templeton Pessimistic
From a 3500-mile
jTtmpleton's prediction seems un
\ reasonably pessimistic. A chart out
j lining the strict minimum Stanford
I can score (Eastman unplaced, Mot
; tram third; Meier third, etc.) gives
Stanford 33 points. Another chart,
stretching every Indian athlete's po
tentialtities to the utmost, shows 72
j tallies.
A compromise estimate claims th<t.
Stanford and U.S.C. will both score
between 52 and 58, with the distri
bution iu this six-point leeway de-
I ciding the meet.
One factor is certain: Stanford's
2-1 favoritism in Eastern betting
ciicles is unjustified. The meet is
an absolute toss-up, and should not
be regarded in any other light.
What must Stanford do to win?
Habies in Shape?
j Student-manager Leslie "Abe"
' Habies must take at least eight
t points in the dashes, a second in
j each event or a first and a third.
| Captain Eastman must shave at least
four seconds from the 1:59 time he
turned in at the P.A.A. 800 meters
last Saturday, so that he can gain
j third place. An Eastman victory over
Princeton's Bill Bonthron is not, in
j conceivable, but a complete failure
to place is also possible.
i Eastman will be running his last
race for Stanford, barring the
N.C.A.A. 800 meters in June. If de
tenu inat ion and very doubtful con
dition can be balanced, and still
spell victory, Stanford is assured
fivi points in the 800 meters. No
question about the determination!
Captain-elect (Jus Meier and
Colto Herbert must take at least
eight points in the hurdles . . .
Phil Williams must cop a second
in the broad jump . . . One of
Stanford's injured vaultcrs must
grab off a fourth place, which
means reaching 13 feet, <i inches
. . . Stanford's strong-arm quartet
must not fall down, thereby earn
ing from 20 to 2(i points in the
shot and discus, and Johnny Mot
tram, a great competitor, must
out-javelin Worntz of Colgate and
McKcnzic of U.S.C., both veterans.
If the weather is fine; if the
muscles arc okeh; if
KFRC will join the Columbia
Broadcasting System on Saturday
in bringing the finals of the meet
across the country, from 11:15 to 1
o'clock, Pacific Coast time. There
will be no broadcast of the pre
liminaries today.
