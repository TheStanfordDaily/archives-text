made a radical departure from
custom in decidnig that their en
dowment pledges will be devoted

ministered through the Stanford

This change from precedent was
made, according to Wayne Bannis
ter, who heads the '33 endowment
drive, because seniors feel that their
money will serve to till a greater
need through student relief.
