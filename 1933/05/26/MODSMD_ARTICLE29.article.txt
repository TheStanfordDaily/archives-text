# Rushing Rules Standâ€” And All's Quiet on Lasuen
## 
### 
Since for the lirsl lime in many years the hulk of I lie
Row lias expressed approval of the previous year's rushing
iiilcs, (lie Inlcrfraternity Council will not embark upon a
plan of wholesale revision also for Ihe lirsl lime in many
years.
Although lasl year's rushing was not entirely peaceful
and calm, the rules promulgated by the (louneil stood the
lest on the whole well. W hen details are worked out in
regard to junior transfers, the regulations should be in
pretty fair shape for at least a few years.
lin I the best part of the news is that both freslunen and
the houses will he relieved of the uncertainty and worry
that has made rushing even more of a strain on both par
lies than it should be normally.
As on the other side of the fence, in women's rushing,
half the bad features can be attributed to confusion as to
what can or cannot be done legally. The inclination is to
lake a chance and hope that it's legal. This policy is almost
certain to gel somebody into trouble sometime.
With the rules standing practically the same Ibis year,
the excuse for illegal practices of ignorance or confusion
will be eliminated.
