# Another Sign of the Timesâ€” A Decrease in Party Supporting Papers
## 
### 
One of the best signs of a more enlightened interest in
public affairs during the past decade is Hie breaking down
of party lines. The last two Presidential elections have il
lustrated the fact that people cannot be swayed by a call
to parly loyally as easily as they were formerly.
One of the clearest indications of the trend away from
the old-fashioned dyed-in-the-wool political partisan is the
decrease since 111(10 of newspapers with straight parly des
ignation.
According to the figures given in one of the recent social
trends reports prepared under the direction of a committee
appointed by former President Hoover, papers claiming to
be "independent Democrat" and "independent Republi
can" have increased live-fold, with a corresponding de
crease in the number of publications claiming to be parly
organs.
During this period papers labeling themselves as "inde
pendent in politics" have nearly doubled, and in HKM) con
stituted the largest single class of publications.
This striking oIV of party chains by newspapers is a
significant trend, and, if publications are mirrors of public
sentiment, it may mean that citizens are casting their bal
lots not so much for Democrats or Republicans as for can
didates whom they have judged according lo their merits.
