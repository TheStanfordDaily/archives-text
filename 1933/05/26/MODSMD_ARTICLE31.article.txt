# Challenge of "Fifth Horseman" Met as B.A.C. Lowers Handicap
## 
### 
You can't please everybody. Rut the Stanford R.A.C.. is
going to try. Next fall the dwindling ranks of football-mad
Americans will be able to see the traditional classic of
Paeilie ('.oast gridiron warfare, the Rig (lame, from Sta
dium seals which cost them only three or four dollars.
Lasl year, in the smaller bowl at Rerkeley, Rig (lame
attendance barely withstood the ravages of the well-known
Fifth Horseman, Depression. Prospects for a capacity Rig
(ianie crowd at Stanford in P.KM were immediately over
east in the minds of people who worry about such things.
And yesterday the R.A.C.. answered the Horseman's chal
leng(Aby lowering the handicap. It is most certainly Stan
lord's desire that the lowering of the ticket prices for the
Rig (lame swells the total receipt at the gate.
Meanwhile the price slash seems just and equitable, in
view of Ihe economic straits in which the man who pays
lilids himself.
