# BULL SESSION
## 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
When times wore good (1929 A.D.) '
no one would do anything about
disarmament because no one ob
jected paying to the government as
long as he was being paid. Now,
when times are bad, we might hope
that the reverse would be true; that
the peoples of the world burdened
by debt (as the cartoons, always
I show them) would rise as one to
' end excessive armaments. The al
most certain fizzle of the Disarma
ment Conference belies that hope.
Some people have argued that
armaments breed war. They reason
that only armed nations fight—
which is true —therefore no arma
ments, no war. This is tantamount
i to saying that only children play
marbles—no marbles, no children. If
people want to fight, nothing can
! stop them. And people seem to want
1 to fight.
1 The annoying thing about arma
ments to me is that they are not
self-supporting. They are so damned
expensive. The arid figures broad
cast by benevolent peace societies
are positively staggering. They show
terrific things—that all the way
from 90 to 97 per cent of our na
tional taxes go to war and his off
spring. That annoys me. It annoys
other people so they have confer
ences—every now and then.
I
Then after every conference the
delegates go home and complain how
the other delegates cheated and
robbed them. They instill the germs
of future conferences in the younger
generation. They lay the foundation
for more diplomacy—which is al
ways unfortunate. After the confer
ence is over, the delegates give out
pious statements; and the nations
, go broke trying to build their
1 armies and navies up to the treaty
! limits. The treaty limitation is usu
ally a maximum toward which the
countries struggle.
i ~
Another gay little trick in these
conferences is to make illegal some
thing which the military authorities
j no longer think is necessary. Thus
it. is that super-dreadnaughts have

I been largely discontinued since Eng
land (who knows) decided that fast
i cruisers are more deadly. No one
' is handicapped; and the conference
can go home a big success.
The present conference will have
to ban something. May I suggest the
immediate abolition of "flying
tanks." This weapon of war is sruel,
inhuman, and impossible. It must
bt stopped at all costs. In the same
! class is the "flying buttress," a re
' incarnation of the medieval weapon
with more and better death-dealing
factors.
The present bone of contention is
! France and France's bone of con
' tention is Germany. Why don't they
get together and realize that they
are cutting each other's nose—
bankrupting themselves—in a race
that never ends.

no one would do anything about
disarmament because no one ob

when times are bad, we might hope
that the reverse would be true; that
