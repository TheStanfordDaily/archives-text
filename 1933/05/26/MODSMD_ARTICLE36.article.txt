LOVE IN A MIST (Reeve-Emery)
—At the Community Theatre.
The Community Theatre's produc
tion of "Love in a Mist" is an ex
ample of what good direction and
good acting can do for a poor play.
The play was a bad choice for two
reasons: first, although it dealt with
genuinely tunny characters and sit
uations, it was clumsy in construc
tion—tho first act creaked with ex
position; second, it was too similar
to "The Bad Man," last full-length
Community Theatre production—the
leading character is a foreigner
with an accent, who appears unex
pectedly at the end of the first act
r.nd has difficulty with the English
language for two more acts.
Ralph Welles' direction was excel-,
lent, especially in clever comedy

, touches, which buoyed up many a
a
deflated moment in the play's dia
logue. The tempo, starting languidly
with Debussy, built to good comedy
after Dorothy Tully's first entrance, \
but failed in the second act climax.
Tully played her role for all it was *
worth, squeezing every drop of
ccrnedy out of it. She is at her best
in a small theatre, for she relies
j greatly on subtle facial expression.
As Count Scipi, Welles displayed
his experienced sense of timing and
comedy best in his "mutual em
barrassment" scene with Dick
s'isher, who gave a humorous and
sympathetic performance of a dif
ficult role. That scene and Tully's'
comedy were the best things in the
show.
Kay Arthur, stepping into the role
of Sidney Rose the last week of
rehearsal, was best in the tempestu
ous love scenes with Scipi. Emily
Gerlough was a successfully vacu
ous aunt, sometimes too conscious
, of her own vacuity. The setting and
. lights lived up to the reputation
i which the Community Theatre has
i made for itself in its recent produc
