# Gordan Leaves Stanford For Fort McArthur Post
## 
### 
Home again and gone again. So
runs, the tale of Captain Richard
Gordan's return to the Farm, from
which he once more departed last
night, bound for Fort McArthur at
Los Angeles. Gordan's work at his
new post will be in connection with
the Civilian Conservation Corps,
with which he was engaged while
av Monterey during the past week.
Polo practice, resumed for a few
days while Captain Gordan was
here, will once more be discontinued,
this time probably for the balance
of the quarter. How long the Card
polo coach will be gone is uncertain,
but it is expected that he will be
away at least until the end of the
summer.
