# HOERNER DOWNS CHAMP IN SEMI-FINALS GOLF PLAY
## 
### J. GRAVES 
Playing superb golf and coming |
through to score more or less of an
upset, Jack Hoerner wrested the
semi-final match and the right to 1
play in the all-University cham
pionship finals from Malcolm Mc-
Naughton, Business School grad.
Former Champ
McNaughton, former intercollsgi
ate champ and ace of the graduate
players entered in the present Uni
versity tourney, was two down when
the smoke of stick-swinging battle ,
had cleared away.
Lawson Little and Jim Rea have
not played their semi-finals match
yet. They are scheduled to start i

around the 18 fairways at 1:15
o'clock today. Little is given a slight
edge, but Rea is shooting good golf
and has more than a mere fighting
chance of scoring an upset and
earning another shot at the cham
pionship.
Little Favored
Little, however, is favored to win
if he keeps on shooting the kind of
golf he did yesterday when he
turned in a card reading 72 over the
course, par 71.
Should either Little or Rea win
today the finals will be a very close
fought match and should be inter
esting to watch. They will be played
next Saturday.
