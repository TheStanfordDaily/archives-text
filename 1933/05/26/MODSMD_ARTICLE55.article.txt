# SIDELINE SLANTS
## 
### 
In a musty, dusty corner of the
Daily business office sits an ancient
adding machine. Yesterday afternoon
I swept away the cobwebs and used
the thing to total the maximum and
minimum number of 1.C.4-A. points
that both Stanford or S.C. could
possibly accumulate.
And I swear by all that's rich in
Heaven that, absolutely coinci
dentally and objectively, 1 reached
the same figures. With all sensible
breaks, either team can score a
maximum of 72 points; with
everything against them, each
squad is apparently sure of at
least 3!5 digits.
Scoff at 72 points for Stanford,
my beloveds, but hearken. With
Metcalfe not competing, Hables has
a real chance for two firsts—that's
ten. Ablowich, Jones, Warner, and
LuValle may all beat Al Blackmail,
but he still gets one point. With
Turner of Michigan out, Eastman,
in any shape at all, will be beaten
only by Bonthron of Princeton and
will earn four more.
This maximum dope sheet gives
Cotto Herbert, with his fast finish,
a win over Paul and Gus Meier,
stronger all the time, a fourth be
hind one of the Yale low hurdlers.
And Gus has a real chance for a
victory in the highs. Twelve hur
dle points.
If Schween beats Von Osdel and
McNaughton again, I still only give
him a third behind Spitz and Brown,
Yale's pole-vaulting high-jumper.
Zaches, hitting the take-off board,
may win the broad-jump and Phil
Wiiliams, over 24 feet, has a fine
chance for third. Eleven in the
jumps.
Thirteen points in the shot is de
manding few breaks, and eleven in
the discus means only that Dunn
beats the Harvard heaver. Few will
dispute a first for Mottram in the
javelin, and I found five pole-vault
points by tieing Miller (if he really
feels well) with Brown and Graber
fer first, and doing the same for
fourth between Deacon and Jeffer-

Somewhere Between 33 and 72

The Stanford minimum counts
Eastman, Hables, Miller, Deacon,
and Blackman completely out.
And the S.C. totals were reached
b> similar hopeful and hopeless
figuring.
For a full week, I have been won
di ring how to guess this meet. And
until today, I had planned on splurg
ing forth with the information that
Stanford was greatly overrated.
But cautious pessimism has been
overcome by the bubbling environ
ment of the campus and by objec
tive scrutiny of all competitors' best
performances. With Michigan out of
the meet and that 33-point mini
mum, Stanford will win the 1.C.4-A.
For the mean between 33 and 72
is 52*2, which is a fair guess. True,
the S.C. Mean is exactly the same,
but it can't reach that figure if
Hablos, Meier, and Mottram beat
their Trojan rivals.
And that is exactly what will
happen. Little Les may not win
two firsts, but he will keep Ball
and Parsons behind him. Gallop
ing (jus may not take the highs,
but he will finish ahead of Welsh !
and Lyon. Joyous Johnny may be j
beaten in the javelin, but Mc- j
Ken/ie and Williamson won't be
the men to do it.
For without the clashes, the highs, j
and the javelin, the Stanford totals, j
both maximum and minimum, ex- i
ceed the S.C. totals. Which means j
that, if Hables, Meier ,and Mottram j
manage to break even—and they'll
do better than that—statistical ac- j
curacy inevitably signifies a Stan
ford victory.
The role of mathematician is j
new to me. and I insist on adding
a subjective element to the ob
jective dope. Which is the com
petitive spirit, usually overem
phasized. but which Stanford did j
express so adequately in the first j
S.C. meet.
Eastman, Hables, Miller, Meier, j
Mottram, Sehween—they're compe- |
litors, all of them. And that's why, J
Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce j
notwithstanding, Stanford will win.!
