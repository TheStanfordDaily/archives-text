# Grif Williams Will Play At Encina Tomorrow Night
## 
### 
Campusites are expected in large
numbers for the Encina Club's New
Lobby Informal tomorrow night at
9 o'clock. •
It is truly a dance unique—being
without motif, surprise attractions,
fancy decoration schemes, or prom- j
ises of splendor. It claims only to
be an excellent opportunity to dance
with a first-class orchestra for a new
minimum—sl.
Grif Williams and his nine-piece
aggregation of musicians, fresh from
the Branner Night. Club Informal,
will be ready to present their best
brand of music, and are saving sev
eral new intermission numbers for j
the frosh.
President Wilbur and Comptroller
Roth will appear at the newest of
campus improvements, the Encina
lobby, acting as sponsors of the
event.
The smooth, cream-colored, almost
Colonial-appearing, remodeled lobby
will be decorated only with green- i
cries and lights, so desirous are the
freshmen of displaying their new
dance-room.
Bids may still be purchased at the
Union.
