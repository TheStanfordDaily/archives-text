( lass Endov nient records, the en
dowment committee of the Class
of '33 b/gins today the annual
campaign for senior pledges. The
camp'Jfcn will extend until Thurs

1/ former years, according to
Vi√üyne Bannister, committee chair
man, individual pledges have aver
aged $5, to be paid annually. Some
limes the pledges have been of
smaller amounts, and in boom years
a great deal larger.
$5 Average Aim
Bannister urges that seniors try
to come up to the $5 average, since
if each graduate in the 1933 class
were? to pledge an annual $5 con
tribution to the endowment fund,
I lie fund would easily surpass the
highest amount left by any previous
graduating class.
There is particular incentive for
endowment contributions this year,
.since the senior class has departed
from past custom in deciding to de
vote its entire endowment fund to
student scholarships. In former years
the annual .sum received from grad
uates has been utilized for current
emergency expenses of the Univer
sity.
Representatives Named
Representatives have been ap
pointed in the living groups to take
care of pledges, and letters are being
.sent to seniors living ofl-campus,
urging their participation in the
drive. Seniors are reminded that the
pledges are revocable if future cir
cumstances make their payment im
possible.
