"Buy that 50-ccnt bid today!"
That, slogan adopted by the Thea -
| Ire Fund Committee to boost its all
| University Informal slated for Fri
j day evening in the Women's Gym,
j took on the nature of a warning
i yesterday when Chairman Stan

j Beaubaire announced that only a
. limited number of tickets will be
sold. The measure will be necessary,
s he explained, to prevent overcrowd
ing of the floor.
Maximum Dancing Aim
i Maximum dancing will be the aim
iof Moeller-Lowry's 11-piece Stan-
J ford Ambassadors, ywho have do
j nated their services for the benefit
I dance. "Solid dancing and few in
| termissions will be our policy," said
I Sam Lowry last night. Al. the :amc
! time he announced that a special
i povelty arrangement of (he "One
I Man Band," patterned after the Ted
1 Weetns recording, will be given.
Off the campus, the Ambassadors
I have been playing engagements in
i Stockton, Fresno, and Sacramento.
Further casing the strain on the
j pocket of the much-hamissed Stan
i ford males, the Committee has se
i cured free cigarettes for those at
tending. These, in addition to Life
Savers, liquid and solid refresh
ments, should provide an evening
long to be remembered for its econ
omy as well as entertainment.
Tally to Help
Milo Tally, lighting technician for
the Toyon Morocco Dance, Junior
Prom, and other recent campus
dances, has added his name to the !
list of those who will donate their
services. Herb Sanderson, Don Mc- :
Kean, and Harlow Williams, also;
experienced lighting men, will also
work gratis. Under Tally's direction, j
the four are expected to produce a 1
lighting display of unusual efTec-!
tiveness.
All lights have been loaned for the j
evening's use. The many donations j
of services and equipment will en- |
able the Theatre Fund Committee |
to present the year's cheapest first- j
class dance.
