# Stanford Band To Hold Concert On Wednesday
## 
### 
Plans arc going ahead to make
the Spring Concert of the Stanford
Band, to be held Wednesday night
in the Pavilion at 8:15 o'clock, one
that will bring back memories of the
rod-coated, white-flannelled foot
ball band of last fall.
Tickets will be on sale this week
for 25 cents apiece. Proceeds from
the concert will be used for a uni
form fund. Don't forget the place of
the concert—Pavilion; time—Wed
nesday, 8:15.
