# Livermore's Platform
## 
### 
"I believe that a graduate student
has every right to expect the sup
perl of the student body in a cam
paign for the office of A.S.S.U.
president. If this were not. so, the
A S.S.U. constitution would not 1
specify that men of graduate stand
ing are eligible. Some of Stanford's
best student body presidents have
been graduates.
"In outlining a program to be
carried out next fall, if elected, my
ideas fall in two distinct divisions.
First, is I he efficient carrying out
of duties and traditions already set
up as needing proper handling for
the well-being <>f the student body.
Such things as publications, dra
matics, the Honor Code, the rally
c< mmittee, the theatre fund, the
men's council, and all the numerous
other traditions and organizations
that have been built up at Stan
ford, will be supported and organ
ized by me to the best of my ability.
"But beyond this, f have a definite
platform for improvement, as out
lined below.
"I. The constantly increasing
citieism of the decline of "Stan
ford spirit" is in the main just.
Although an intangible thing, it
nevertheless must be revived if
Stanford is to remain a strong
University and produce loyal
alumni. Although it requires an
efficient all-around program hy a
strong student body president to
bring this spirit back, there is one
tangible way to start about re
viving it. That is by having a
really good first-of-thc-ycar open
ing assembly. New men and wo- ,
men coming into the University
should feel the place is alive. To [
litis end, the lirsl assembly of the
year should not be as in the past,
with three or four people on the i
platform, and a yell-leader try
ing single-handed to stir up en
thusiasm. Through publicity and
organization, there should he a big
turnout. All the leading men on
the campus should he on the plat
form for the incoming students to
see and hear. The glee club should
be in the center of the assembly
hall in full force, to really start
the crowd singing. Either through
the Dail.v. or by passing out hand- I
hills at the doors, every one should
have and know the words of the
yells and songs. The first assembly
of the year should he run off with
spirit, to develop spirit. I have (

seen it Hone properly in other
universities, and will <lo it here if
elected.
"2. To follow up this idea, there
'should be more all-Universily as
semblies with better programs. The
vtudent body will turn out if these
assemblies are handled correctly.
"J. Entering junior transfers should
j get a better reception upon entering
j Stanford. At the suggestion of the
Student Committee, I have already
started a program along these lines.
"4. The increase of the proportion
j of women should be recognized by
giving thorn a proportional increase
of power in student affairs.
"5. Closer faculty contact should
be encouraged.
"6, Intramural and minor .sports
should be given as much recognition
as possible, to encourage a higher
percentage of participation in ath
letics.
"7. The Student Relief committee
should he appointed early in the
year, and should he helped to ac
tively carry on a program in be
half of the large number of stu
dents who are suffering from the
depression.
"8. Closer contact and better feel -
should be striven for between
Hall and Row, and between the in
dividual living groups themselves.
"9. In carrying out this program,
constant advice and co-operation
should be sought between the stu
dent s and the officials of the ad
ministration, such as the President,
the Comptroller, and the Dean of
Men."

viving it. That is by having a
really good first-of-thc-ycar open

men coming into the University
should feel the place is alive. To [

year should not be as in the past,
with three or four people on the i
platform, and a yell-leader try

thusiasm. Through publicity and
organization, there should he a big
turnout. All the leading men on
the campus should he on the plat
form for the incoming students to

be in the center of the assembly
hall in full force, to really start
the crowd singing. Either through
the Dail.v. or by passing out hand- I

half of the large number of stu
dents who are suffering from the
