"Stanford student life faces a cru -
cial year in 1933-1934. The old day .
of the "Farm," and the "Rough," the
"500" denoted a Stanford school
j spirit that has been slowly under
j mined by many changes. The Bon
fire, the Junior Opera, the Concert,
i Series, and the "500" have all gone.
| The financial order and the changing
| social conditions have brought these
changes. If Stanford is to retain its
spirit of student fellowship that has
! given it a characteristic and en-
I viable nation-wide reputation, cer
! tain definite courses must be fol
I lowed.
"First: and foremost, (he Honor
Code, again firmly entrenched in
Stanford thought, must he con
stantly perfected. With (lie influx
of new students, especially junior
transfers, each student must do
his best to solidify student opinion
in the belief that the code of a
gentleman is the only code re
spected in scholastic work.
"Second: Stanford's unique pn
cition on the "Farm'' has always
made for more compact student
friendship. The Executive Coin
tniltee must lead the way for all
organizations to further a greater
concentration of social activities
on the campus.
"Third: The junior transfer, now
a definite pari of the school, must,
be made an integral part of the
student body activities through con
tinued augmented programs of co
operation.
"Fourth: Stanford's reputation
as a school of good sports and
genial hosts must he preserved hy
the complete and unqualified
elimination of all 'booing* at ath
letic contests,
"Fifth: Stanford owes much ol
its success to a spirit of conserva
tism. All attempts at making this
a tabloid campus must he defi-
. nitely repressed.
"Sixth: Dramatics at Stanford
must be maintained. This can only
! be done by an informed selection
! of the best plays and by a proper
| skilled production of those plays.
Seventh: A theatre is badly needed
but unless Dramatics is first, justi
â–  fied by real enthusiasm and success,
! such a theatre would be a waste of
! money when the University needs
, dormitories.
"Eighth: The Concert Series, one
of the lew cultural phases of the
campus remaining, should be main
tained if any feasible plan can be
j presented.
"Ninth: The admittance of more
women, without lowering require
ments is to be heralded as highly
desirable in making for more nor
mal relationships without detract
ing from Stanford's appeal or
present reputation.
"Tenth: To handle the maize of
student financial problems, the un
i enviable position of Student Man
j ager was created, and is held by a
I student of financial ability. As such,
it merits the fullest co-operation and
respect from all groups.
"Lastly: ( All units of the campus
must work in co-operation to as
sure the continued success and high
standing of Stanford student life.
The student body president must
take the lead in carrying out these
aims so that Stanford will retain
i (he tradition of the Honor Code,
j gcod fellowship, and school spirit
I where "(he winds of freedom blow"
on the Farm.
