# Another Election Eveâ€” A Good Election Tomorrow, Maybe
## 
### 
Platforms and everything. Thai is, everylh'ing bill
lor<-111 illl parades and smoker rallies, both phenomena
being somewhat out of dale. Hut the Daily has been suc
cessful, for the most part, in gelling Hie candidates for
A.S.S.T. president to slate their honorable intentions in
platform style. The criticism may be made that Stanford's
politically minded students have learned I heir lessons well
here on the Kami, thai Ihev have learned how to pro
nounce a platform that is al once hopefully vague and
technically noncommittal. Hul there is meat in the plat
forms printed this morning, nevertheless. The candidates,
willingly complying with ;i request that they give the voters
some idea of their plans, have, in several instances, offered
constructive suggestions for the administration of student
all airs.
It's been a good campaign. The Mali and How caucuses
conducted llieir business in orderly manner and, the cam
pus has every reason lo believe, with good judgment. The
Daily, for ils part, lias welcomed the new source of politi
cal news and the opportunity to make something of it. The
students, for the lirsl lime in years, have a chance to know
what the candidates of their choice stand for.
Hul what does it all mean? Absolutely nothing, if the
student body demains apathetic toward anv matter politi
cal. Tomorrow's A.S.S.I'. election is the most important in
years. I pon the shoulders of the men elected tomorrow
will rest responsibility for the maintenance of old Stanford
traditions and the initiation of the inevitable new tradi
tions which will come next year. The way has been paved
toward making tomorrow's election the most successful, as
well as the most vital, which the present student body has
witnessed.
Hul will il be? With llearstian directness, the Daily
can only say that il depends upon Y()l T , Mr. Voter.
