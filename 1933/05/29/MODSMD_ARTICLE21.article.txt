# Mr. Harris Paints a "Slightly" Exaggerated Picture of University Life
## 
### 
Iteed Harris, former editor of the Columbia Spcclalar,
who was forced to resign from that school because of an
attack on 'the faculty, is picking up some odd pennies in
these hard times by a so-called expose of American uni
versities which is running as a serial in the scandal-sheet
of a San Francisco newspaper.
In his latest puerile attempt at mixing the publicized
value of liis name with the usual inflated tone of a maga
zine section article, he gives special attention to Pacific
('.oast universities. Taking the Hollywood atmosphere of
the t 'diversity of Southern (California as his criterion, he
implies that we of the West are practically free of any fac
ulty supervision.
He pictures (California campi as "beautiful and glamor
ous plavspols" where "petting along moonlit college paths
is perfectly permissible; the students can smoke when Ihev
want to; dance when they want to; drink when Ihev want
to." "In fact," he concludes, "Ihev can do almost anything
Ihev want to just so they stay decent."
A pretty picture, Mr. Harris, and one which your audi
ence, always avaricious for any lid-hit of college scandal,
can easily lick their lips over. I nforlunatelv, however,
your picture, like your previous "expose" of college fool
hall, is, to put it mildly and politely, rather exaggerated.
Hut then, of course, the more highly seasoned your stories
the heller your public will like tliein. "We Irusl your pay
check conies in regularly.
