Tliev Icll us wo need adventure. We're gelling il, and
we're going In got il i>u( \vli;»I adventure?
Tliey tell us we nerd adventure because lite people of
a country inusl find for their anihilions another outlet
• /titer than crime and war.
A national survey indicates that hut one of eii^ltt mem
bers of college graduating classes for HKW will be able to
gel jobs. I'or Ihe seven-eighths Ibis will mean an adven
ture.
It appears that collegiate ambitions might profit from
some guidance and help. Kducationallv proud America
cannot be proud that but one-eighth of her citizen class
who has been educated to lead her eannol find a job. The
door is bill slightly ajar.
The graduate isn't asking for a great reward, lie
doesn't ask that a piece of sheepskin become an "open
sesame" to fame and fortune, thai he be given Ihe oppor
tunity to thrive at the expense of another. Htit il does seem
hardly fair that sulTicicnt recognition is not given to those
who have indicated by four years of application thai they
are not of the common herd; that an opportunity, even a
small opportunity, isn't open for those to show that they
are something. The paradoxical situation is that when
there is so much to do there is so little to do. It may be
thai one should concentrate upon Ihe little and feel salis-
Well, adventure's Ihe word. Life is an adventure, truly
enough, bill even freshmen would appreciate a change in
Ihe adventure. \V<tshinfffnn Stale C.ollrr/r Evonjrrcn
