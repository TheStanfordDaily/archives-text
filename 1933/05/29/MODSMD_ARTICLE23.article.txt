# BULL SESSION
## 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
In no less than six magazine and
newspaper articles within the last
month, great pains have been taken
to prove or disprove when, why,
and how George Washington in
stalled his set of false teeth. And I
would like to know when, why, and
how this question becomes import
ant. Of course as an original con
tribution to Man's store of knowl
edge, it is excellent material for a
thesis or a master's dissertation—
excellent for those dusty tomes be
cause no one ever reads them (in
cluding the people who write them).
Why, however, should the infor
mation be broadcast to idealists like
myself that Washington had false
teeth? There is nothing wrong with
false teeth per se. Within ten years,
I myself will be armed with a set,
loving as I do butter cookies; and
being cursed with soft enamel and
dying molar nerves. But there is
nothing romantic about false teeth.
I like to think of noble Washing
ton standing resolutely at Valley
Forge looking off at the cold sunset
—arms folded on weary chest—head
high—and lips tightly set. But now
f w?ll know that those lips are
tightly set over false teeth. Imme
diately I seem them soaking in a
glass beside his bed. Then, visions
of cheap upstairs dentists' offices —
Sunday advertisements. The grand
picture of Washington is smashed;
and for no good reason except that
somebody found out that he had
false teeth.
It might be said of a man that his
greatness transcended poverty, il

literacy, disease, or anything but
false teeth. The two (false teeth and
greatness) are incompatible, irre
concilable, and impossible. Imagine
Caesar midstream in the flowing
Rubicon—with false teeth. Picture if
you can false teeth jumping around
in Napoleon's mouth as he gallops
along on the famous white horse.
Bismark—the mailed fist and the
false teeth. All are impossible.
Theoretically, we should consider
the man as a man—apart from his
false teeth or any other personal
handicap. But we don't. I have never
yet been able to praise the perfectly
delightful horror of Poe's "Pit and
the Pendulum" or "Murders in the
Rue Morgue" without somebody in
the crowd remarking that Poe was
a dope addict. What about it? I
don't care if he drank gasoline; rob
bed blind men; or hit himself with
hammers. He could write; but he
I was a dope fiend and that fact will
i live when his stories have been for
! gotten.
So U. S. Grant's bulldog attack
on Richmond will be slurred by his
Cacanova approach on Tokio. De
bunking of an idea is excellent but
debunking a person as a person is
useless and cruel. I think it was
Ripley who has completely disposed
of my hero, John Paul Jones, by
. stating: That his name was neither
John, nor Paul, nor Jones —that he
never sailed a ship—and what is
more, John Paul Jones is not pro
nounced John Paul Jones.
By his teeth you shall know him.
Washington is damned.

excellent for those dusty tomes be
cause no one ever reads them (in
cluding the people who write them).
Why, however, should the infor
mation be broadcast to idealists like
myself that Washington had false
teeth? There is nothing wrong with
false teeth per se. Within ten years,
I myself will be armed with a set,
loving as I do butter cookies; and
being cursed with soft enamel and
dying molar nerves. But there is
nothing romantic about false teeth.
I like to think of noble Washing
ton standing resolutely at Valley
Forge looking off at the cold sunset
—arms folded on weary chest—head
high—and lips tightly set. But now
f w?ll know that those lips are
tightly set over false teeth. Imme
diately I seem them soaking in a
glass beside his bed. Then, visions
of cheap upstairs dentists' offices —
Sunday advertisements. The grand
picture of Washington is smashed;
and for no good reason except that
somebody found out that he had
false teeth.
It might be said of a man that his
greatness transcended poverty, il

literacy, disease, or anything but
false teeth. The two (false teeth and
greatness) are incompatible, irre
concilable, and impossible. Imagine
Caesar midstream in the flowing
Rubicon—with false teeth. Picture if
you can false teeth jumping around
in Napoleon's mouth as he gallops
along on the famous white horse.
Bismark—the mailed fist and the
false teeth. All are impossible.
Theoretically, we should consider
the man as a man—apart from his
false teeth or any other personal
handicap. But we don't. I have never
yet been able to praise the perfectly
delightful horror of Poe's "Pit and
the Pendulum" or "Murders in the
Rue Morgue" without somebody in
the crowd remarking that Poe was
a dope addict. What about it? I
don't care if he drank gasoline; rob
bed blind men; or hit himself with
hammers. He could write; but he
I was a dope fiend and that fact will
i live when his stories have been for
! gotten.
So U. S. Grant's bulldog attack
on Richmond will be slurred by his
Cacanova approach on Tokio. De
bunking of an idea is excellent but
debunking a person as a person is
useless and cruel. I think it was
Ripley who has completely disposed
of my hero, John Paul Jones, by
. stating: That his name was neither
John, nor Paul, nor Jones —that he
never sailed a ship—and what is
more, John Paul Jones is not pro
nounced John Paul Jones.
By his teeth you shall know him.
Washington is damned.

OIR FATHER lIAD FALSE TEETH
In no less than six magazine and
newspaper articles within the last
month, great pains have been taken
to prove or disprove when, why,
and how George Washington in
stalled his set of false teeth. And I
would like to know when, why, and
how this question becomes import
ant. Of course as an original con
tribution to Man's store of knowl
edge, it is excellent material for a
thesis or a master's dissertation—
