<;US ARNIIEIM'S ORCHESTRA—
At the St. Francis.
In contrast to the Fio-Rito deep
lonecl music, the Arnheim orches
trations seem lighter, softer, and
more subtle in that same unfailing
rhythm, with less variance in tempo
from hotcha—to dream tunes.
The versatility of the personnel
furnishes decided entertainment
with quick changes from the regular
set-up to an all-violin-plus-bas
soon, then to an all-singing com
bination and back to the starting
point with the addition of one or
more of the specialty singers.
Mary Bell, Shirley Ross, Jimmy
Newell, and the Three Rhythm Ras
cals make up the specialty singers
on the program, but, speaking of
specialties, there is the sax player
who does a "Yohn-Yohnson" in "My
Cousin from Milwaukee."
And if you have a flare for the
sweet and lovely, just request a

SLIPPER OANCINC, AT THE CAR
DINAL HOTEL.
An old tradition well worth the
patronage of the campus has been
revived: Saturday night dancing at
the Cardinal Hotel. Our own Gordon
Heche and his orchestra are the
music-makers, with Bob Thornton
and Pete Peck doing the vocals.
The cover charge is seventy-five
cents, with dinner for a dollar and
a quarter, and a very fancy supper
is served after 10 o'clock for 60 cents,
with other items at a minimum.
The new Supper Room is modern
istic in lighting and decorations, but
most interesting is the fact that the
room is comfortably cool for danc
ing. The courteous concern of Bar

i narr Bates, host of the evening, plus
the arrangement of the room and
floor show make up the general at
mostphere of a small and very fa
voriate night club. —Hewit
PICTURE - SNATCHER (Warners)
—At the Stanford Theatre.
I like a picture that takes its time,
j and somehow this latest opus of the
Shove-'Em-and-Leave - 'Em school
misses that category.
Cagney impersonates a fugitive
from a shady past who joins a news
paper to "go straight," and suddenly
finds himself engaged in the shady
pastime of picture-snatching (i.e.,
taking pictures of people who re
luse to have their pictures taken).
I am under the impression that
the picture had a story, but couldn't
| swear to it. There were numerous
(three, to be specific) instances of
Cagney's herculean courage exhib
ited while taking pictures, and for
contrast, .scenes to show that he nlso
has a way with him.
In the former group he accom
plishes the impossible with a regu-
I larity which would baffle any but
I the most sophisticated.
The romantic scenes are pehvaded
by the gentility of the hero, who of
course calls every female "baby"'
1 (with raised eyebrows), who falls
in love with one, to whom he makes
strange osculatory noises over the
telephone; who has playful fisticuffs
with another; and who, with char
-1 acteristic subtlety, coyly snaps the
garter of a third.
There are men in the picture,
though. One is the policeman-father
. of the girl, and the other is the
drinker-who-goes-pure City Editor,
who really likss Danny despite hav
i ing uttered in his teeth such an cpi
i thet as "Once a rat, always a rat."

The film is not without its touch
ing moments, as witness the one in
which Danny quietly tears up ihe
marriage license which he had hoped
to have use for before his indiscre
tions with his camera. (Soft music.)

PICTURE - SNATCHER (Warners)
—At the Stanford Theatre.
I like a picture that takes its time,
j and somehow this latest opus of the
Shove-'Em-and-Leave - 'Em school
misses that category.
Cagney impersonates a fugitive
from a shady past who joins a news
paper to "go straight," and suddenly
finds himself engaged in the shady
pastime of picture-snatching (i.e.,
taking pictures of people who re
luse to have their pictures taken).
I am under the impression that
the picture had a story, but couldn't
| swear to it. There were numerous
(three, to be specific) instances of
Cagney's herculean courage exhib
ited while taking pictures, and for
contrast, .scenes to show that he nlso
has a way with him.
In the former group he accom
plishes the impossible with a regu-
I larity which would baffle any but
I the most sophisticated.
The romantic scenes are pehvaded
by the gentility of the hero, who of
course calls every female "baby"'
1 (with raised eyebrows), who falls
in love with one, to whom he makes
strange osculatory noises over the
telephone; who has playful fisticuffs
with another; and who, with char
-1 acteristic subtlety, coyly snaps the
garter of a third.
There are men in the picture,
though. One is the policeman-father
. of the girl, and the other is the
drinker-who-goes-pure City Editor,
who really likss Danny despite hav
i ing uttered in his teeth such an cpi
i thet as "Once a rat, always a rat."

The film is not without its touch
ing moments, as witness the one in
which Danny quietly tears up ihe
marriage license which he had hoped
to have use for before his indiscre
tions with his camera. (Soft music.)

In contrast to the Fio-Rito deep

The versatility of the personnel
