DAYTON, Tenn.—Dayton, known
as "monkey town" to a large part
of the country and boastful of its
strict fundamentalism, was shocked
today with the finding of an "ape
man's" skull that may prove to be
the long-sought missing link.

happened if the skull had been Jug
up as Exhibit A for the defense
when the late William Jennings
Bryan and Clarence Darrow were
engaged in their battle of the cen
tury during the Scopes evolution
trial eight years ago.—News item.
