Well, we won.
Yes sir, our sinew-shanked boys
from Sun-Kisted California sure
came through to show those down-
Eastern fellers a thing or two about
galloping around that old cinder
oval.
Yes sir, by gosh, all right, our boys
from the land of the orange blossoms
and the blossoming bathing beauties
scored a great big 95 points and
there were only 225 points alto
gether. So there. Our boys from
Southern California and Stanford
and U.C.L.A. went and got them
selves six first places and seven
seconds, and Johnny Lyman, one
of our California boys, broke the
shot-put record all by himself.
It was a great day for our euca
lyptus - lined. Pacific - bordered
state. Nice, blond, young Charley
Parsons, whose old man used to
run plenty fast for the Trojans
when (lie Wooden Horse was still
just a capering colt, crashed
through with the winning points
lor us, he did. lie took third in the
200-meter dash to sew up the meet
lor our hoys from Southern Cali
fornia, and were those down-
Easterners mortified. My, oil, my!
Of course, it didn't make much
difference what nice, blond, young
Charley did, because if Southern
California had not won, why then
Stanford would have won, and that
would have been just hunky-dory,
100, for our beloved, fog-infested
state of California. But no one cared
whether Stanford or Southern Cab
le.rnia won just as long as our boys
came through.
Dear old hoy-faced Dink Tem
pleton, the famous newspaper
man who coaches the Stanford
track team sometimes, and dear
old dour-faced Dean Cromwell,
the famous capitalist who coach
is the Southern California track
team sometimes, were both happy
in their modest manner when our
boys won the meet. Templeton
and Cromwell, who are Califor
nians first and Indians or Trojans
second, were so modest that each
conceded the meet to the other.
And Templeton proved to be the
best conceder.
Conceder Templeton even said
that the Stanford boys would score j
42 points, which is exactly what '
they did score. But Conceder Crom
well forgot to say how many points
the doughty Southern California j
boys' would score.
Of course, it might have been
snazier if the Stanford team had 1
won, because then there would
have been less civil war in our
asphalted state of California. And
it was rather too bad that Mr.
Ilahles, one of the Stanford team,
could not run, because he is a fine
sprinter of whom all Californians
can be justly proud.
And then it was rather too bad,
too, that they put a sliver instead \
o! a handle on Johnny Mottram's
javelin so that be couldn't win an- |
other event for our precious state of [
California. And it was too bad that'
Lloyd Schween and Phil Williams |
could not orient themselves to the 1
New England blasts and chills and
therefore didn't add more points to
lb, total of the Hoover state of Cali- !
fornia.
And it was too bad that one of
the California boys named East
man got himself hurt so that he
couldn't beat Dill Bonthron in the
SOO meters and Jimmy LuVallc in
the 400 meters, although it really i
doesn't make much difference be- |
cause LuVallc is a California boy
anyway, and they say that Bon
thron is one of the very nicest of
the down-Eastern fellers.
So all these things can be forgot-
Icn, for after all, our boys from!
California won the 1.C.4-A. meet. I
t>uess we .sure showed those down-
East toughies that we grow track j
men in our beloved, balmy, palmy |
slate of California. Oh boy. Oh boy. '

the 400 meters, although it really i
doesn't make much difference be- |
cause LuVallc is a California boy
anyway, and they say that Bon
thron is one of the very nicest of
the down-Eastern fellers.
So all these things can be forgot-
Icn, for after all, our boys from!
California won the 1.C.4-A. meet. I
t>uess we .sure showed those down-
East toughies that we grow track j
men in our beloved, balmy, palmy |
slate of California. Oh boy. Oh boy. '
Aw, nerts. —Dick Strouse i
Well, we won.
Yes sir, our sinew-shanked boys
from Sun-Kisted California sure
came through to show those down-
Eastern fellers a thing or two about
galloping around that old cinder
oval.
Yes sir, by gosh, all right, our boys
from the land of the orange blossoms
and the blossoming bathing beauties
scored a great big 95 points and
there were only 225 points alto
gether. So there. Our boys from
Southern California and Stanford
and U.C.L.A. went and got them
selves six first places and seven
seconds, and Johnny Lyman, one
of our California boys, broke the
shot-put record all by himself.
It was a great day for our euca
lyptus - lined. Pacific - bordered
state. Nice, blond, young Charley
Parsons, whose old man used to
run plenty fast for the Trojans
when (lie Wooden Horse was still
just a capering colt, crashed
through with the winning points
lor us, he did. lie took third in the
200-meter dash to sew up the meet
lor our hoys from Southern Cali
fornia, and were those down-
Easterners mortified. My, oil, my!
Of course, it didn't make much
difference what nice, blond, young
Charley did, because if Southern
California had not won, why then
Stanford would have won, and that
would have been just hunky-dory,
100, for our beloved, fog-infested
state of California. But no one cared
whether Stanford or Southern Cab
le.rnia won just as long as our boys
came through.
Dear old hoy-faced Dink Tem
pleton, the famous newspaper
man who coaches the Stanford
track team sometimes, and dear
old dour-faced Dean Cromwell,
the famous capitalist who coach
is the Southern California track
team sometimes, were both happy
in their modest manner when our
boys won the meet. Templeton
and Cromwell, who are Califor
nians first and Indians or Trojans
second, were so modest that each
conceded the meet to the other.
And Templeton proved to be the
best conceder.
Conceder Templeton even said
that the Stanford boys would score j
42 points, which is exactly what '
they did score. But Conceder Crom
well forgot to say how many points
the doughty Southern California j
boys' would score.
Of course, it might have been
snazier if the Stanford team had 1
won, because then there would
have been less civil war in our
asphalted state of California. And
it was rather too bad that Mr.
Ilahles, one of the Stanford team,
could not run, because he is a fine
sprinter of whom all Californians
can be justly proud.
And then it was rather too bad,
too, that they put a sliver instead \
o! a handle on Johnny Mottram's
javelin so that be couldn't win an- |
other event for our precious state of [
California. And it was too bad that'
Lloyd Schween and Phil Williams |
could not orient themselves to the 1
New England blasts and chills and
therefore didn't add more points to
lb, total of the Hoover state of Cali- !
fornia.
And it was too bad that one of
the California boys named East
man got himself hurt so that he
couldn't beat Dill Bonthron in the
SOO meters and Jimmy LuVallc in
the 400 meters, although it really i
doesn't make much difference be- |
cause LuVallc is a California boy
anyway, and they say that Bon
thron is one of the very nicest of
the down-Eastern fellers.
