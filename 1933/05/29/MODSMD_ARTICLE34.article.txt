1 of Odell, who only managed to re
turn the stitched sphere to the in
-1 field in time to hold Mires at third,
j Oppenheim's infield hit scored
Mires, who beat a throw to the
plate. Abbott, Phi Kap catcher, at
| tempted to nip Oppenheim at sec
j ond on the same play, but the ef
fort proved futile when the runner
scored as Odell in center failed to
! trap a wild throw. Reed, Kahn, and
Tcjrghetta went out in one-two-three
j order, retiring the side.
In the third the Phi Kaps, aided
j by two passes, pushed over three
i earned runs. Burch and Abbott, the
j first two men to stride to the plate
in the inning, drew walks. They
scirrried home on Woodworth's lusty
triple against the left field fence a
few moments later.
Phi Kaps Run Wild
The Phi Kaps continued their;
scoring spree in the fourth when
three hits, two walks, and two errors
produced four runs. Martin reached
first on an infield error, going to
third on Black's double after Bogan
bounced to the pitcher's box. Abbott
singled, scoring Martin and Black,
and was brought in on Anderson's
one-base blow after lie had stolen
second. Woodworth walked, and
with Abbott, executed a neat double
steal which bore fruit when Abbott
scored on Kahn's wild throw to
third.
With two out in the sixth, the Phi j
Kaps contributed their last scores
of the day when three runs crossed
the rubber. In the same inning El
Toro rallied to score four runs and
were within striking distance of
victory when Mires committed the
monster atrocity of baseball by
striking out with the bases loaded
to close the inning.

of the day when three runs crossed
the rubber. In the same inning El

monster atrocity of baseball by
striking out with the bases loaded
to close the inning.

Toro Scores First
In the first inning, Fessio, Toro
lead-off man, drew a walk, scoring
| when Mires, the next man up, hit to
j center where the ball impishly
| evaded the frantic retrieving efforts
1 of Odell, who only managed to re
turn the stitched sphere to the in
-1 field in time to hold Mires at third,
j Oppenheim's infield hit scored
Mires, who beat a throw to the
plate. Abbott, Phi Kap catcher, at
| tempted to nip Oppenheim at sec
j ond on the same play, but the ef
fort proved futile when the runner
scored as Odell in center failed to
! trap a wild throw. Reed, Kahn, and
Tcjrghetta went out in one-two-three
j order, retiring the side.
In the third the Phi Kaps, aided
j by two passes, pushed over three
i earned runs. Burch and Abbott, the
j first two men to stride to the plate
in the inning, drew walks. They
scirrried home on Woodworth's lusty
triple against the left field fence a
few moments later.
Phi Kaps Run Wild
The Phi Kaps continued their;
scoring spree in the fourth when
three hits, two walks, and two errors
produced four runs. Martin reached
first on an infield error, going to
third on Black's double after Bogan
bounced to the pitcher's box. Abbott
singled, scoring Martin and Black,
and was brought in on Anderson's
one-base blow after lie had stolen
second. Woodworth walked, and
with Abbott, executed a neat double
steal which bore fruit when Abbott
scored on Kahn's wild throw to
third.
