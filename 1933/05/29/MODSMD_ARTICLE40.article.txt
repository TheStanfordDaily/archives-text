# TO START MURAL RELAYS WITH 440 MILE RACES TODAY
## 
### 
This jifternoon at 4 o'clock the
Intramural Relays get under way.
Gene Mires, intramural manager,
has scheduled the 4-man 440 and
mile medley events for today. To
morrow the 4-man and 8-man mile
races will be run. The shuttle hur
dle and 4-man 880 are slated for
Wednesday.
Breakers and El Torn enter the
three day contest as favorites. At
present these two eating clubs
hold all six intramural records. A
silver loving cup, suitably en
graved, will be presented to any
team surpassing any of tin- rec
ords.
Delta Kappa Epsilon, Kappa Sig
ma, Phi Kappa Sigma, Alpha Delta
Phi, and Delta Chi also loom as pos
sible winners. Old-timers hasten to
point out that dark horse entries
often surprise in intramural track,
however.
Twenty points on the intramural
scoring system will be awarded the
winner of the whole carnival, with
fifteen going to the second-place or
ganization. Scoring by events will
be on a 5, 3, 2, 1 basis.
No block "S" men or numeral
" '36" winners will be eligible. Nor
will anyone not registered be al
lowed to compete unless the intra
mural committee makes a special
dispensation.
