Direct from a highly successful
and considerably extended run in
Los Angeles comes Belasco and
Curran's production of "Dinner at
Eight," now at the Curran Theatre.
The play, by George Kaufman and
Edna Ferber, who also penned "The
Royal Family," attained signal .suc
cess in New York and London, and
is given a spectacular staging by
the coast producers.
Based on the "Grand Hotel" plan
of dramaturgy, the present opus
gives an insight into the lives of the
guests and servants connected with
a "dinner at eight" before the event

begins. The play is an elaborate one,
calling for numerous scene changes,
in which are cleverly contrasted the
different characters, in episodes hu
morous, dramatic, or intense.
The Belasco and Curran produc
tion is being handled with the same
care that marked the New York and
London presentations, and the cast
ing and directing have been given
minute attention.
The cast comprises a number of
well-known names, including Hedda
Hopper, Alice White, Louis Calhern,
Jobyna Howland, Huntly Gordon.
Don Alvarado, Martha Sleeper, and
Inez Courtney.
