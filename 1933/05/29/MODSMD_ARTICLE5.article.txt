# A.S.S.U. Voting Law Explained
## Ernie Arbuckle Describes Preferential System 
### 
Ernie Arbuckle, chairman of the
| election board, last night issued the
j following statement to explain the
| preferential voting system that will
I be used for the first time tomorrow.
I—To validate the ballot three
j choices must be indicated for each
i office unless there are less than
J three persons running for the office.
If there are more than three candi
dates running, the system still calls
i for three choices. The number of
choices to be recorded is clearly
I marked on the ballot.
i 2 Offices for which there are two
j or more men to be elected will be
voted on by a plurality system ac
cording to the A.S.S.U. ruling. Thus
| three men on the Men's Councli and
j two assistant yell leaders will be
j elected under the old system.
3—Since to a certain extent the
I Hall and Row have organized in
nominating fewer men, the prefer
ential system will have no effect in
I the election of a man for an office
j for which only two have been nomi
nated. But to provide a uniform bal
lot and conform with the new
amendment, the preferential system
will be used throughout.
