# Dopesters Wrong Again: S.C. Wins
## 
### 
Is> Albert (iuerard, Jr.
Stanford's fifteen-man track team
rode itself into the 1.C.4-A. track
championship Friday and Saturday
I at Cambridge, Mass., on the crest of
| a series of astounding performances,
nnd rode it.self right back into sec
ond, place again when ever more
startling upsets gave U.S.C.'s Tro
ji.ns their fourth national title in as
i many years.
Amazing performances by Captain
Ben Eastman, John Lyman, Cotto
Herbert, Bill Miller, and Bud Dea
con shot the Indian total skyward,
only If) have it drop to a final total
of 42 points when Les Hables, Phil
Williams, Johnny Mottram, Al
Blackmail, Paul Zachcs, and Lloyd
Sehwcen failed to place. U.S.C.
I scored 45 points, when Charley Par
sons earned third place in the? last
event of the meet, the 200-meter
dash. His three points proved the
winning margin.
Hard Luck
Most disastrous were the circum
stances which prevented Hables and
Mottram from scoring. Both men
had been counted on for first places.
Or. Friday Hables was shut out in
his semi-final of the 100 meters; on
Saturday his trick knee had one of
its off-days, and the plucky Indian
sprinter finished last in a semi-final
of the 200 meter race which he was
expected to win.
Mottram, competing in his first na
tional meet, threw just far enough
to qualify on Friday, expecting to cut
loose with his full power on the day
of the finals. Saturday the wind was
so strong against the throwers that
none of the six spear-tossers could
even equal Mottram's 195-foot mark
made on Friday.
Stanford interest was focussed on
the final 1.C.4-A. attempt of Ben
Eastman, whose performances in ,
the 1931 ahd 1032 intercollegiate
classics made him the most-nick
named runner in sportdom.
Eastman did not disappoint. "Rat
ing his pace'' like a champion, the
Indian captain stayed in the ruck
for 400 meters, appeared to be defi
nitely out of the running, then came
to the front with an amazing rush,
held his space-eating stride through
out the race, nnd lost only by the

' scantest of margins in the last
; agonizing yards.
Eastman Circat
In defeat, Eastman was ' still
"'Blazing Ben." His gallant 1:53.5 ef -
fort on Saturday stamped him as a
much greater champion than his 1:50
races of last spring ever did.
Bill Miller, the lad who didn't
want to go with the team because
he considered himself 156 pounds of
I useless baggage, was not far behind
Eastman in showing his real calibre. (
Best Vaulters
Competing against the cream of
the country's pole-vaulters, Miller
soared 13 feet, (j inches to tie for
first, injured ankle and all. One of
those tying the Olympic champion
; was another Stanford man ham
pered by injuries, Bud Deacon.
The best actual performance of
the meet was made by John Lyman,
Stanford shot-putter, who whipped
' the pellet out an astonishing 52 feel,
S'/a inches, a heave that, easily wiped
out Harlow Rothert's meet record,
and just, missed Leo Sexton's world
record. Lyman should have no
1 rouble beating the latler's 53 feel,
'/â– j inch mark next year.
Lcs Hables announced before his
trip East that he would hang up the
spikes after Saturday's races.
