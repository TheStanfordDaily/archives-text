# California Will Solicit Openly For Prep Stars
## C. B. Kyle, President Of Big C Society, Reveals Program To Hire "Representative" Employed To Look For Good High School Athletes 
### STAN BEAUBAIRE 
rrili; (.olden, Bear, tarnishing with impending age, wants athletes, admits
it quite frankly, and henceforth will initiate a student-controlled policy
that will bring prep-school men of high calibre to the University of
California.
In a statement printed yesterday in the California Monthly, alumni
magazine, President Cecil B. Kyle of the Big C Society revealed that
active proselyting of high-school athletes features the new program to
seek and solicit high-school and junior college athletes for California.
Although amazed Stanford officials were prompt to point out Pacific !
Coast Conference rules which forbid direct solicitation of athletes, Cali
fornia men evidently believe that this will not stand, in view of the follow-

ing joint statement issued by Kyle
and Olin Cort Majors, president of
the Big C board of directors:
Proposing to "appoint a repre
sentative of this society whose busi
ness it shall be to present to sec
ondary school boys interested in
sports the appeal of California as a
place of clean athletics, combined
with sound athletic standards," the
resolution adds that this "repre
sentative" shall be employed on a
full-time basis, with salary and
traveling expenses to be supplied
by "friends of the society and of the
university who are in sympathy with
this program."
"We do not want athletes who
are not also students, nor do we
wish anyone to come to California
for athletics only," the two Big C
men stated.
Taking advantage of a reputed
"edge" on other institutions, Presi
dent Robert Gordon Sproul of Cali
fornia added his preference that
athletes should "come to California
without any solicitation whatever,"
but declared that in view of the fact
that "high-school athletes are very
seldom, if ever, permitted to select
a college or university on any such
basis as superior educational advan
tages."
Move Above Board
The move of the Big C society
has the merit of "being open and
above-board, with an executive who
will be known and who may be held
responsible for his acts," accyrding
to Sproul.
The Big C Society is composed of
all California athletes who have won
letters, and even though not directly
connected with the University is an
ex-officio unit of the institution.
