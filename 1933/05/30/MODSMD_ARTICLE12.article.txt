# COMEDY STARS TO APPEAR AT CHARITY DANCE
## Sellout Seen In Fifty-Cent Bids; Tickets Available At A.S.S.U. Office 
### 
Announcement was made last
night that ihe three most famous
comedians of the screen would ap
pear at Friday night's all-University
informal for the benefit of the Thea
tre Fund.
Oliver Hardy, Stan Laurel, and
Michael (Mickey) Mouse, will all
be seen on the screen, not a personal
appearance, at four different occa
sions scattered throughout the eve
ning for 20 minutes at a time.
Fifty-cent bids were snapped up
rapidly yesterday, with prospect of
a complete sell-out today. Commit
tee officials said that they would
definitely stick to their resolution to
limit the number of bids and main
tain an uncrowded dance floor.
Lights for the evening were being
assembled yesterday in great num
bers, and Milo Tally with his three
fusive display.
Harold Helvenston and Don Lie
bendorfer, together with their re
spective wives, have agreed to act
as patrons and patronesses of the
affair.
With cigarettes and Life Savers
already for the benefit
those attending, committee members
were at work trying to assure
"something entirely and absolutely
unseen previously at a campus
dance" as the principal refreshment.
Moeller and Lowry, whose eleven
pitce Stanford Ambassadors orches
tra will furnish the rhythm for the
dancing feet without charge, have
mapped their program for the eve
ning and promise many novelty
numbers, including probably special
vocalizations of the "Old Kitchen
Kettle" and "Put On Your Old Gray
Bonnet."
