# Campus Politics in Final Turmoil As Voting Begins
## New Preferential Rules Must Be Followed For Ballots To Be Valid; Election Will Be Held From 8:30 Until 2 O'Clock Near Law Steps 
### B KELLOGG 
AS the campus last night gyrated in a flurry of last-minute log-rolling
and ward-heeling, three presidential candidates, Livermore, Iluneke,
and Trautnian, gnawed their linger nails in nervous anticipation of the
results of today's balloting.
(. hief among the worries of backers of the three parties was the ruling
that cut out the possibility of a one-shot vote. The preferential voting
system, added to the A.S.S.U. constitution last February, makes it impera
tive to vote for three candidates if the ballot is to be valid.
According to the ruling announced yesterday morning, to validate a
ballot three preferences must be indicated for each office unless there are
less than three persons running for the office. If there are more than

$ three nominees for the office the
system still requires three selections.
When the revised list, of nominees
i stood okened yesterday by .the elec
tion board the political leaders noted
1 that in the main, party tickets re
i mained the same as named in the
j individual caucuses.
The outstanding exception to
this was the withdrawal of Herb
Sanderson, insurgent candidate,
from the vice-presidency race.
Possibility that the rebel ranks
j might he blasted was expressed
i Friday when the declination of
Trautman was rumored. This was
denied later by Trautman, how
! ever.
Arbuckie yesterday repeated his
i statement that the election will be
held between the hours of 8:30 and
2 o'clock near the Law Steps. Count
ing of the ballots will be started
i sometime in the early afternoon in
Room 231. The campus is invited to
I watch the counting, Arbuckie said.
Today's election brings to a close
! a two weeks' campaign that old -
timers on the campus call the mast
exciting in recent years. Beginning
in the Hall caucus that opened with
| the statement that this year for the
| first time political moves would be
brought out of the dark for the
! whole campus to see, the election
was progressed to an orderly con
' elusion according to election heads.
Following the Hall caucus the
Row leaders met to select their can
didate and repeated the statement
damning Hall-Row enmity.
As a bombshell surprise to the
entire campus an insurgent party
that represented a coalition movc
i ment, announced a complete ticket,
early last week that set recognized
party chiefs to thinking.
The election hoard that will lo
i tal the ballots today consists of:
Marian Harper, Dorothy Ann
Jackson, Mary Rath. Sam Barclay,
Will Eisner, George Irvine, Marvie
Kahn, John Robb, Fred Searls,
William Smith, and Milo Tally.
