# A 						Course in Debunking— With Little Left for the Student to Do
## 
### 
I lie I 'diversity of Wisconsin, which lims made llio name
of Madison ;i svmhol of liberalism in education, is lo offer 1
lo ils students a course in debunking. II is rather amusing,
in view of Wisconsin's reputation as a university willing
l(» espouse the minority viewpoint, Ihal Hie university
beads should find il necessary to subject their students to
any further exploding of popular fallacies.
Al Wisconsin, and for Ihal mailer at most other col
leges. the student of liberal arts changes his ideas very
quickly without the aid of any course devoted exclusively
lo blasting myths. Hut Wisconsin, apparently, is not taking
any chances.
The course will make il possible for any student to learn
the I'ollv of "Buy American" without taking a course in
economics, or to find out that Cicrmany is not solely re
sponsible for the World War without taking a history,
course.
To lind out that an old, common idea is entirely mis
taken is, lo most, a stimulating experience. Once the dis
covery is made, the student should have the pleasure of
playing the debunker, by bringing the word to his less
fortunate acquaintances who have not yet seen the light. I
Hut the best pari of the whole experience is that the
student has to do a little digging himself in order that his
ideas mav undergo the change Ihal comes with a college 1
education. To set up the fallacies in wholesale quantity
and then knock them down while the student sits and
walchcs smacks much of pre-digeslion.
