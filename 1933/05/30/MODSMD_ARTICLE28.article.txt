"To be at home in all lands and ages; lo count nature
a familiar acquaintance and act an intimate friend; lo
gain a standard for the appreciation of other men's work
ami the criticism of your own; lo carry I lie keys of the
world's library in your pocket, and feel its resources be
hind you in whatever you undertake; lo make hdsls of
friends anions the men of your own age who are to be the
leaders in all walks of life; lo lose yourself in generous
enthusiasm and co-opcrale with others for common ends
this is the otter of the college for the best four years of
your life."
This is how William DeWilt Hyde looks at what is,
for want of a heller name, called a college education. It
is .-in altitude far more common several years ago than it
is today. College students lately, especially the present
geuera'ion, have come to regard the benefits, if any, of a
four-year course ;il the average university in a far differ
ent light.
The mocking, challenging attitude that America is grad
ually hiking on toward the older standards is typified bv
Ihe undergraduate's conception of his education. Lost
are the lime-honored ideals, Ihe criteria lhat have served
America faithfully for generations. Perhaps America has
come lo maturity; perhaps she is showing the first signs
of decadence.
Whichever il is, Ihe student of today is well up in the
van of modern beliefs, of modern attitudes and expression.
