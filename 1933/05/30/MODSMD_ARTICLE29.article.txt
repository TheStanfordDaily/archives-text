W'lci! Ilto results will he of the University of Califor
nia's recent declaration in regard to proselyting of 11i i»1 1 -
school athletes is not easy to fathom.
One at least, however, is certain—there will he a gen
eral llare-up in the Pacific ('.oast Conference. The other
members are going to feel resentful that the Berkeley au
thorities have stolen the lime-light, have jumped the gun
on the rest.
Stanford undergraduates look on at the Berkeley antics
with a faint amusement and an ironical admiration for the
boldness with which California has stated her intention ot
knowing what she wants and what she's going to do about
gelting it.
It is a hold step, one which will inevitably be ques
tioned. Perhaps California is to he congratulated on her
desire to throw overboard all the more or less hypocritical
customs in regard to proselyting; with Berkeley frankly
slating her stand, the old hush-hush may go.
It seems impossible that the existence of proselyting
is not known by the majority of people concerned. It also
seems impossible that the present undercover methods are
appnncd of. No college authorities have yet had the cour
age to come out in the sunshine with their projects.
Very possibly California is right in her stand; possibly
the other ('onference members will follow her. Whatever
the result, it should clear up the present situation in regard
to commercialized football and give people something new
to talk about.
