# BULL SESSION
## CAL BREAKS INTO THE OPEN 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
No longer will the whisperers be
laughed down. No longer will those
who felt that the only difference be
tween the New York Yankees and
llit' average college football team —
j was the size of tire .salaries—be
pooh-poohed. The California letter
man's society has announced a pol
icy of open proselyting of athletes
under the leadership of a paid sec
retary. The high .schools and junior
colleges are the field. Bigger and
| better California teams are the goal.
That this will not be a new oc
supation has long been a suspicion.
The only original concept is the
j brazen frankness of the plan. No
longer will grabbing up athletes be
I sub rosa; it will be a super robust
contest and let the conference cellar
! take the hindmost. And the cellar
, will. The chief attention on the .sur
face in the athletic industry has
! been production; it will now be
; shifted to gathering of raw nia
[ terials.
In theory, the new plan is bad
a;; evidence to the horrible decline
of "college boy's sports." The de
fense of collegiate sports used to be
that the rumors were false and that,
after all, things weren't so bad. That
last flimsy defense is gone. There
j .she is—college athletics in her
naked commercialism. If high-school
athletes are to be "persuaded" to
attend Cal by this new system, what
| persuasion is to be used?
Will Cal attract a better athletic

team by lauding the merits of its
philosophy department? Will an ull
;,tar classical literature faculty draw
a more powerful football eleven?
The chances are that to answer these
questions in the affirmative would
be a bit too optimistic. While a rea
sonable number of athleti# stars will
come to a university for the same
things that bring any one else, when
an organized attempt is launched
to garner stars, other inducements
will be used.
Actually, however, Cal's plan is
' to be applauded for in no other way
will professionalized athletics meet
| a quicker death. The average poi -
son never believed all the horrible
tales that simmered and boiled be
neath the surface. Now, only the
totally blind will not see and be
lieve. The more flagrant a decayed
system becomes, the sooner it crum
bles and falls. Football—for that is
; what it simmers down to —will meet
| radical changes unless President
Sproul has a good-talking-to with
the men who launched the Cal Plan
! for a football team that can beat
1 U.S.C. and Stanford.
With open proselyting, universi
ties cannot even maintain the theory
that they are institutions of higher
learning. A baseball club seeks
baseball players; a plumbing con
tractor seeks plumbers; and for
what does a college search? Stu
dents to plumb the scholastic
depths? How naive to ask! The uni
versities of the land are gunning
i for gridiron heroes.

With open proselyting, universi

that they are institutions of higher
learning. A baseball club seeks
baseball players; a plumbing con
tractor seeks plumbers; and for
what does a college search? Stu

No longer will the whisperers be
laughed down. No longer will those
who felt that the only difference be
tween the New York Yankees and
llit' average college football team —
j was the size of tire .salaries—be
pooh-poohed. The California letter
man's society has announced a pol
icy of open proselyting of athletes
under the leadership of a paid sec
retary. The high .schools and junior
colleges are the field. Bigger and
| better California teams are the goal.
That this will not be a new oc
supation has long been a suspicion.
The only original concept is the
j brazen frankness of the plan. No
longer will grabbing up athletes be
I sub rosa; it will be a super robust
contest and let the conference cellar

face in the athletic industry has
! been production; it will now be
; shifted to gathering of raw nia
[ terials.
In theory, the new plan is bad
a;; evidence to the horrible decline
of "college boy's sports." The de
fense of collegiate sports used to be
that the rumors were false and that,
after all, things weren't so bad. That
last flimsy defense is gone. There
j .she is—college athletics in her
naked commercialism. If high-school
athletes are to be "persuaded" to
attend Cal by this new system, what
| persuasion is to be used?
Will Cal attract a better athletic

team by lauding the merits of its
philosophy department? Will an ull
;,tar classical literature faculty draw
a more powerful football eleven?
The chances are that to answer these
questions in the affirmative would
be a bit too optimistic. While a rea
sonable number of athleti# stars will
come to a university for the same
things that bring any one else, when
an organized attempt is launched
to garner stars, other inducements
will be used.
Actually, however, Cal's plan is
