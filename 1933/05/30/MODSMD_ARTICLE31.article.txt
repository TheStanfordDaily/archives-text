# THE 						REVIEWER
## 
### 
TIIE BARBARIAN (MGM)—At the
Stanford Theatre.
Ramon Navarro adds an Egyptian
to his long line of delightful for
eigners in the pleasantly impossible
Barbarian. Myrna Loy is charming
ly wasted as the changeable heroine
—her mother was Egyptian. Louise
Closser Hale is a piquantly bawdy
companion. Reginald Denny is ef
fectively ineffectual as Loy's fiance.
The story is The Sheik with vari
ations—racy dialogue and modern
istic Cairo hotel added. Amusing
and swift for the first two reels, the
plot may be successfully guessed at
from the moment Lay whips Na
varro. Later on Navarro whips : Loy.
There is also much sand, two oases,
many camels and horses, a brief
Foreign Legion, three dead Arabians,
one seraglio, a fat villain, a native
marriage, a patriarch, an Egyptian
bath, and a kidnapping. The best
scenes are Novarro's rendition of a
pagan love song—Egyptian variety
—at which task he is unexcelled.
The best comedian is a camel which
bites Louise C. Hale.
The picture is credited with a good
cast, beautiful music, successful hu
mor, and sometimes effective set
tings. To its discredit are an obvi
ous and therefore slow plot, fre
quently poor use of the Dunning
process, and overuse of romantic
cliches. —Brauns
LIS BALLET MECANIQUE —To be
presented in the San Francisco
Opera House, Friday night under
(lie direction of Adolph Holm.
If enthusiasm of both director
and cast is an indication, the ballet
program should be a success. Bolm,
internationally famous ballet mas
ter, puts his cast of 40 dancers
through a rehearsal with dynamic
energy, entering into the dance him
self and even, at times, substituting
for the orchestra to demonstrate a
point.
The use of the human body to
express the mechanical age is con
vincing in its angularity and regu
lar rhythm, and represents a tre
mendous machine which is said to
be a newspaper press.
At the other extreme of the pro
gram is a Russian village scenc with
all the freedom and spontaneity
usually found in folk dances, and
with accompaniment by a Russian
orchestra and a finely trained chorus

°f 18.
With able help from m principal
dancers, Elise Reiman and Robert
Bell, also Evelyn Wenger and Nico
Charis.se, Adolph Bolm is the cen
tral figure of this program.

TIIE BARBARIAN (MGM)—At the
Stanford Theatre.
Ramon Navarro adds an Egyptian
to his long line of delightful for
eigners in the pleasantly impossible
Barbarian. Myrna Loy is charming
ly wasted as the changeable heroine
—her mother was Egyptian. Louise
Closser Hale is a piquantly bawdy
companion. Reginald Denny is ef
fectively ineffectual as Loy's fiance.
The story is The Sheik with vari
ations—racy dialogue and modern
istic Cairo hotel added. Amusing
and swift for the first two reels, the
plot may be successfully guessed at
from the moment Lay whips Na
varro. Later on Navarro whips : Loy.
There is also much sand, two oases,
many camels and horses, a brief
Foreign Legion, three dead Arabians,
one seraglio, a fat villain, a native
marriage, a patriarch, an Egyptian
bath, and a kidnapping. The best
scenes are Novarro's rendition of a
pagan love song—Egyptian variety
—at which task he is unexcelled.
The best comedian is a camel which
bites Louise C. Hale.
The picture is credited with a good
cast, beautiful music, successful hu
mor, and sometimes effective set
tings. To its discredit are an obvi
ous and therefore slow plot, fre
quently poor use of the Dunning
process, and overuse of romantic
cliches. —Brauns
LIS BALLET MECANIQUE —To be
presented in the San Francisco
Opera House, Friday night under
(lie direction of Adolph Holm.
If enthusiasm of both director
and cast is an indication, the ballet
program should be a success. Bolm,
internationally famous ballet mas
ter, puts his cast of 40 dancers
through a rehearsal with dynamic
energy, entering into the dance him
self and even, at times, substituting
for the orchestra to demonstrate a
point.
The use of the human body to
express the mechanical age is con
vincing in its angularity and regu
lar rhythm, and represents a tre
mendous machine which is said to
be a newspaper press.
At the other extreme of the pro
gram is a Russian village scenc with
all the freedom and spontaneity
usually found in folk dances, and
with accompaniment by a Russian
orchestra and a finely trained chorus
