Being h great admirer of having
all things open and above-board, I
read with pleasure yesterday after
noon the report that California had
decided to come right out and prose
lyte for athletes on the open market.
Of course, California didn't say
anything quite that bold and
l.razen. the report reading that the
Rig C Society planned to "appoint
a representative of the society
whose business it shall be to pre
sent to secondary school boys in
terested in sports the appeal of
California as a place of clean ath
letics, combined with sound ath
letic standards."
Thus it appears that a persuasive
gentleman will be hired by Califor
nia influential for the express pur
pose of convincing future varsity
shot-putters, tackles, and infielders
of the magnitude of the Campanile
and the magnaminity of Coaches
Bill Ingram, Brutus Hamilton, Nibs
Price, and Clint Evans.
But cautious California, with a
chance to tear away a mouldy cur
tain from in front of a play all have
been watching through that curtain,
tries naively to hide the curtain
tearing under the idea of illustrating
to hit;h-school athletes the scholas
tic advantages of California.
Pointing out to an athlete the
scholastic advantages of a univer
sity is like showing the Japanese
peace delegates Sunnyvale Air Base
which was done recently. In either
case, the poor delegate or athlete
(it makes little difference) wonders
and then laughs. And in both cases,
the public only laughs.
Hut aside from the California
amateur attempt to fool the pub
lie, the idea is line. No longer will
anyone be able to accuse Califor
nia of using unfair tactics in
proselyting athletes. Everyone will
know that California is using what
are known as "unfair tactics." It
would be like a peace conference
ending in an agreement between
;iII nations to publicize armament:
everyone would know that the
devil had the foremost and the
devil would take the hindmost.
For since the report does indicate
that California will not lower her
scholastic requirements for athletes
so purchased in the open market,
the action consists but in being hon
est. And (quoting Mark Twain)
since "it's no longer possible to earn
an honest living," maybe California
will find it possible to earn a dis
honest living by saying she does so.
So, personally, I fail to feel the
proper horror at California's action.
If a situation exists, it must be met;
and if a situation must be met, there
is little merit in meeting it secretly.
But whether the situation is an
inevitable accompaniment of Uni
versity life is a filly of a different
hue. Whether or not it is necessary
for an institution, dedicated to the
dissemination of knowledge to the
youth of the land, to possess good
football and baseball and basketball
and track and tennis teams is an
interesting question related directly
to modern psychology and the mpd
orn theories of educating the young.
The syllogism at present, in all its
pristine logic, is something like this:
a university must have money; the
best source of money is a good foot
ball team: the best way of obtaining
a good football team is by obtaining
good football players; the best way
of obtaining good football players is
by coming right out and saying you
are trying to obtain them.
Therefore, unless the university
is willing to find another source of
income or to obtain less income,
v. hy not be frank?
Stanford, while not the pure
white maiden of proselyting inno
cence many believe it to be, has
usually been relatively clean in
its attempts to persuade athletes
that l*alo Alto is the personifica
tion of all that is fine in city life;
that its milk shakes and movies
are unsurpassable; that it's cli
mate is best by government test.
And Stanford will probably re
main that way, believing old
fashioncdly that school children
should be taught mathematics
rather than athletics.
A friend of mine once said that
children should be obscene but not

absurd. The present football situa
tion that transforms universities
into country clubs is certainly ab
surd. And by hiding the truth, it
becomes obscene as well.

versity life is a filly of a different
hue. Whether or not it is necessary
for an institution, dedicated to the
dissemination of knowledge to the
youth of the land, to possess good
football and baseball and basketball
and track and tennis teams is an
interesting question related directly
to modern psychology and the mpd
orn theories of educating the young.
The syllogism at present, in all its
pristine logic, is something like this:
a university must have money; the
best source of money is a good foot
ball team: the best way of obtaining
a good football team is by obtaining
good football players; the best way
of obtaining good football players is
by coming right out and saying you
are trying to obtain them.
Therefore, unless the university
is willing to find another source of
income or to obtain less income,
v. hy not be frank?
Stanford, while not the pure
white maiden of proselyting inno
cence many believe it to be, has
usually been relatively clean in
its attempts to persuade athletes
that l*alo Alto is the personifica
tion of all that is fine in city life;
that its milk shakes and movies
are unsurpassable; that it's cli
mate is best by government test.
And Stanford will probably re
main that way, believing old
fashioncdly that school children
should be taught mathematics
rather than athletics.
A friend of mine once said that
children should be obscene but not

absurd. The present football situa
tion that transforms universities
into country clubs is certainly ab
surd. And by hiding the truth, it
becomes obscene as well.

Being h great admirer of having
all things open and above-board, I
read with pleasure yesterday after
noon the report that California had
decided to come right out and prose
lyte for athletes on the open market.
Of course, California didn't say
anything quite that bold and
l.razen. the report reading that the
Rig C Society planned to "appoint
a representative of the society
whose business it shall be to pre
sent to secondary school boys in
terested in sports the appeal of
California as a place of clean ath
letics, combined with sound ath
letic standards."
Thus it appears that a persuasive
gentleman will be hired by Califor
nia influential for the express pur
pose of convincing future varsity
shot-putters, tackles, and infielders
of the magnitude of the Campanile
and the magnaminity of Coaches
Bill Ingram, Brutus Hamilton, Nibs
Price, and Clint Evans.
But cautious California, with a
chance to tear away a mouldy cur
tain from in front of a play all have
been watching through that curtain,
tries naively to hide the curtain
tearing under the idea of illustrating
to hit;h-school athletes the scholas
tic advantages of California.
Pointing out to an athlete the
scholastic advantages of a univer
sity is like showing the Japanese
peace delegates Sunnyvale Air Base
which was done recently. In either
case, the poor delegate or athlete
(it makes little difference) wonders
and then laughs. And in both cases,
the public only laughs.
Hut aside from the California
amateur attempt to fool the pub
lie, the idea is line. No longer will
anyone be able to accuse Califor
nia of using unfair tactics in
proselyting athletes. Everyone will
know that California is using what
are known as "unfair tactics." It
would be like a peace conference
ending in an agreement between
;iII nations to publicize armament:
everyone would know that the
devil had the foremost and the
devil would take the hindmost.
For since the report does indicate
that California will not lower her
scholastic requirements for athletes
so purchased in the open market,
the action consists but in being hon
est. And (quoting Mark Twain)
since "it's no longer possible to earn
an honest living," maybe California
will find it possible to earn a dis
honest living by saying she does so.
So, personally, I fail to feel the
proper horror at California's action.
If a situation exists, it must be met;
and if a situation must be met, there
is little merit in meeting it secretly.
But whether the situation is an
inevitable accompaniment of Uni
versity life is a filly of a different
hue. Whether or not it is necessary
for an institution, dedicated to the
dissemination of knowledge to the
youth of the land, to possess good
football and baseball and basketball
and track and tennis teams is an
