### 
Inspecting sewage disposal
plants may be an ethical en
gineering occupation, but to
John Hcdberg, instructor of
Civil Engineering at Stanford,
it is a "dirty job.''
Hedherg was conducting a
three-day excursion trip of his
Civil Engineering class in Sani
tation. On the first day the
class was examining the sew
age disposal plant at St. Mary's
College when lledberg lost his
balance and fell into the sew
age tank.
As he fell, he pulled the de
