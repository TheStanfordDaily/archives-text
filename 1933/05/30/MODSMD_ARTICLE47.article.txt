# GALLANT IN DEFEAT, BEN EASTMAN CLOSES CAREER
## 
### SPUD HAMILTON 
When a tired "Big Ben" Eastman
trailed over the finish line at Har
vard Stadium last Saturday, in
fourth place behind the torrid pace
ol Bill Bonthron, Princeton ace, it
wtiis a sad climax to the college
career of the great Blazer.
Saturday's race was probably
Eastman's last for Stanford. Al
though there was sonic question
that Ben would enter the N.C.A.A.
at Chicago if he could not do him
self justice at the Intercollegiates,
Dink Templeton announced after
the meet that only three Stanford
men would be entered at Chicago.
Here Lahorde, Bill Miller, and
(Â«us Meier comprise the trio. The
N.C.A.A. competition will be Mil
ler and Laborde's last in Stanford
suits.
Eastman reached the peak of his
career in early season of last year,
when he successively cracked the
world's mark in the 440 and the 880
yard runs. The smashing of Ted
Meredith's long-standing 440 mark
made Eastman a subject of specu

lative discussion by track bugs east
and west. A good number of them
held it impossible that anyone
should clip the old mark of 47.4 sec
onds at all, and when it was flashed
that Ben had lowered it by a full
second, it seemed unbelievable.
Eastman's first record w.us earned
in the L.A.A.C. meet on March 7.
and then about a month later, it
was announced that he would try
foi an 880 mark in the triangular
meet with S.F.U. and the Olympic
Club. Ben came through again, clip
ping 3-10 of a second from Dr. Otto
Peltzer's record with 1:50.3 for the
two laps.
The Trojan-Stanford dual meet
of last year might be singled out
as Ben's greatest individual day.
That afternoon he ran ambitious
Trojan YVoessner into the ground
with a grilling 47.1 quarter, and
then came back to another victory
in the half, with 1:53.8 seconds.
A winning anchor lap in the re
lay filled out Eastman's activity
for the afternoon.
