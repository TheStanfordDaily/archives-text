# House Passes Bill To Okeh Legal Tender
## G.O.P. Scores Measure As "Repudiation" 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 29 (TP) â€”Act-
ing quickly, the House today voted
legal tender money should be used
henceforth in the settlement of con
tractual obligations of the Govern
ment and of the private citizen.
Passage of the bill, designed by
the administration to give the same
value to all legal tender money as
was held by gold before the Govern
ment called that metal in to the
Treasury, gave House approval to:
Payment of all private mort
gages and private debts of all
kinds, both past and future, in i
any legal tender money.
Settlement of international ob
ligations, including war debts, in j
legal tender money of the United
Slates instead of gold.
Payment of the Government's !
debt to private citizens, including
liberty and all other Government |
bonds, in any legal money.
A vote of 283 to 57 sent the bill
to the Senate, where the Banking
Committee has approved it.
There Democratic leaders expect
early favorable action to clear the I
way for a large financial operation
the Treasury is going to undertake |
shortly.
The administration wants the gold J
clause eliminated from all future j
and existing contracts to put those |
it proposes to issue on an equality j
with those outstanding by making I
them payable in legal tender.
The resolution met a hail of Re- !
publican criticism on the argument, j
it constituted "repudiation" of $100,- ]
000,000,000 in Government and pri
vate contracts. The Republicans i
also contended it was tantamount'
to reducing the foreign debt by al
lowing the debtor countries to pay
in currency instead of in gold.
