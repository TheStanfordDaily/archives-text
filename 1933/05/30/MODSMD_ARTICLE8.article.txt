Guernsey cows will be named
! after any of the passing "500" who
I so desire, points out the Razz sec
i tion of the 1933 Quad which is mak
! ing its campus appearance on
i Thursday. A neighboring dairy farm
has kindly offered to name their
' champions after Stanford women.
Campus personalities, activities,
and student government all take
i a beating in this traditional fea
ture of the Quad. Full page arti
; cles in good razz style with ap
i propriatc photographs for illustra
tion abound.
"Masque Ball is a Fizzle" heads
I an enticing article on this great so
cial spectacle of the year. It is a fur
ther characterized as an orgy having
been looked forward to by few, en
joyed by less, and remembered by
! none. ,

"Stanford Women in Despair" re
veals to the waiting campus the in
side story of the passing of the
"500." The cryptic Quad critic gives
the true reasons for the admittance
or the general mob.
A lull-page picture of "Roughie-
Toughie" Tiny Thornhill is the prize
illustration of the Razz section. The
action shots of personalities, many
taking the subject unawares, are
quite unusual, and in some cases
racy.
Ex Committee is taken down the
line with a story on dramatics as
a minor sport. The "Solons" are
quoted thus, "Phoocy on dramatic
council, watch us pick a bum one."
"Eagle Eye" Charlie Karl is aptly
characterized in this exposition.
Quad sales drive will continue un
til Thursday, when the distribution
of the yearbook will begin.
