With Cap and Gown. your shoes play an impor
tant part. They must be distinctive and good
looking, yet dignified enough to be in keeping with
the time and occasion. They too should be useful
and appropriate for other occasions after gradua
tion. For such an important event, Pumps seem
to take the lead—because they can be worn ap
propriately with so many costumes.
We illustrate three models: The Opera, above,
comes in White Kid or Black Kid — $6.50. The
Tryst, in Blue or Chaff Kid — $6.50. And the
Damita, in White Suede — $7.50.
