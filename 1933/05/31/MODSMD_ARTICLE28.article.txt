# The 						Charity Worm Turns For the Students' Benefit
## 
### 
Stanford's band, l< 11 ii>-ll»oui»lit-ol" as the auxiliary color
in Isig (lames, comes before the student body tonight in a
new role, that of a concert organization. Kighlv of the best
men in the 101 that paraded lor thousands last fall have,
during winter and spring quarters, been spending Iwo eve
nings each week preparing themselves for this evening
and a chance to replace the uniforms which have been
worn for nearly 10 years.
Thev have one of the recognized outstanding 10 trum
peters in the I'niled States, Charles Hubb, who will be
heard in a difficult solo arrangement.
The Daily sees a fallacy in the publicity campaign laid
out by the band managers. Kmphasis has been put on the
need for new uniforms. That we grant. Hut why place
the strong point on charily from the student body when it
is charily to the Farm?
Stanford's band is no haywire orchestra. It is a group
ot men who do not place a light emphasis on the value of
music. I nder the leadership of Professor Krncst Whitney
Martin, a veteran in his field, the men have been trained
during their college careers and have acquired a firm ap
preciation ol music as such. Assisting Professor Martin
and engaged as the actual director has been William A.
liicketl, who has devoted his life to band work in large
I'omnuinilies and who has become nationally famous.
Moreover, the band has provisionally planned a concert
lour of Southern California next September. While the
members would get only personal benefit from such a trip,
Stanford as a school would he directly benefitted bv the
favorable publicity which the band would create. And the
school needs consideration in these times.
As the Daim looks at it, tonight's band concert is a
technical free lunch for the student body. Twenty-five
cents paid for an admission is a negligible matter when
one considers the enjoyment.
