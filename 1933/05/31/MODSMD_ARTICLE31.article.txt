# BULL SESSION
## THE 						PAINLESS APPEAL 
### ABE MELLINKOFF 
If you see the same thing often
enough, you come to believe it. That
accounts for the great confidence we
all have in our own ability. So it is
that I have been seeing Hearst pub
licity for the sales tax so long and
in so many different forms, that I
thought it high time that I prove to
myself that I have not yet suc
cumbed. Furthermore by stating in
print the big laughs in this taxation
idea, I will prevent myself in the
hereafter ever falling pray to its
wiles and charms—at the risk of in
consistency.
The fact that Hearst stands to gain
personally from the adoption of a
.sc.les tax (i.e., a tax on sales) is no
objection to the idea but may ac
count for his great exuberance. It is
clear that this sales tax will not be
on newspapers; at least that is not
planned. If it were ever suggested
that a two-cent tax be placed on
every paper that Hearst printed, the
evils of the sales tax would become j
very evident to the great publisher.
Secondly, Hearst pays huge in
come taxes—huge for two reasons.
First, he has a huge income; and
sccond, his business is not such that
ho can do what Morgan did. The
sales tax will replace the income
tax; and Hearst wins at both ends.
But despite the fact that Hearst
gains by the idea, the plan is per- I
nicious in its inception and is con
trary to the fundamental principles
of taxation. Obviously, people should
pay according to their ability to pay.
The only fair way to measure ability i

lis by income. The more a man
makes, the more he can afford to
spend for all things—including taxes.
But a general sales tax places an
equal burden on all who buy a pair
oi' shoes—or a gallon of gasoline.
The $20,000 per week men and the
$20 per week man both play 4 cents
per gallon in taxation. While it is
true the former buys a few more
gallons of gasoline than the latter,
; this difference in no manner com
pensates for the high difference in
i salary.
But those who favor the sales tax
; have one argument that is hard to
beat; the same argument that cheap
advertising dentists use—it is pain
less—absolute and guaranteed. It's
painless because you never have to
I fill out an income tax statement.
You never know exactly how much
the government is extracting. In
that sense, too, it is painless. It has
'l the same appeal as installment buy
ing—you are always paying your
taxes; no one large outlay.
If the collection of the sales tax
is so superior, it is possible to adopt
it and still retain the fairness of the
income tax. The method is simply a
graduated sales tax. $25 on a Ford
and $500 on a Packard; and maybe
| $175 on a Buick. Italian vases for
Mr. Hearst's castle might be sales
-1 taxed to the tune of $300 per. In i
this way, taxation according to abil- '
ity might be retained but it would
be even more difficult than the
much-abused and evaded income
I tf'X.

this way, taxation according to abil- '
ity might be retained but it would
be even more difficult than the
much-abused and evaded income
I tf'X.
If you see the same thing often
enough, you come to believe it. That
accounts for the great confidence we
all have in our own ability. So it is
that I have been seeing Hearst pub
licity for the sales tax so long and
in so many different forms, that I
thought it high time that I prove to
myself that I have not yet suc
cumbed. Furthermore by stating in
print the big laughs in this taxation
idea, I will prevent myself in the
hereafter ever falling pray to its
wiles and charms—at the risk of in
consistency.
The fact that Hearst stands to gain
personally from the adoption of a
.sc.les tax (i.e., a tax on sales) is no
objection to the idea but may ac
count for his great exuberance. It is
clear that this sales tax will not be
on newspapers; at least that is not
planned. If it were ever suggested
that a two-cent tax be placed on
every paper that Hearst printed, the
evils of the sales tax would become j
very evident to the great publisher.
Secondly, Hearst pays huge in
come taxes—huge for two reasons.
First, he has a huge income; and
sccond, his business is not such that
ho can do what Morgan did. The
sales tax will replace the income
tax; and Hearst wins at both ends.
But despite the fact that Hearst
gains by the idea, the plan is per- I
nicious in its inception and is con
trary to the fundamental principles
of taxation. Obviously, people should
pay according to their ability to pay.
The only fair way to measure ability i

lis by income. The more a man
makes, the more he can afford to
spend for all things—including taxes.
But a general sales tax places an
equal burden on all who buy a pair
oi' shoes—or a gallon of gasoline.
The $20,000 per week men and the
$20 per week man both play 4 cents
per gallon in taxation. While it is
true the former buys a few more
gallons of gasoline than the latter,
; this difference in no manner com
pensates for the high difference in
i salary.
But those who favor the sales tax
; have one argument that is hard to
beat; the same argument that cheap
advertising dentists use—it is pain
less—absolute and guaranteed. It's
painless because you never have to
I fill out an income tax statement.
You never know exactly how much
the government is extracting. In
that sense, too, it is painless. It has
'l the same appeal as installment buy
ing—you are always paying your
taxes; no one large outlay.
If the collection of the sales tax
is so superior, it is possible to adopt
it and still retain the fairness of the
income tax. The method is simply a
graduated sales tax. $25 on a Ford
and $500 on a Packard; and maybe
| $175 on a Buick. Italian vases for
Mr. Hearst's castle might be sales
-1 taxed to the tune of $300 per. In i
this way, taxation according to abil- '
ity might be retained but it would
be even more difficult than the
much-abused and evaded income
