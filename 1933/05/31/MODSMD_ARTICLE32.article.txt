Editor's Note: This is the sixth of i
a series of articles on members of
the Stanford faculty who will leave
the University this June. Similar j
articles will appear in the future.
Soon to depart for Washington,
D.C., and later, for Europe, Hubert
G. Schenck, Asssistant Professor of
Geology, will leave Stanford some
time during July. He plans to at
tend the session of the International :
Geological Congress in Washington,
held during the week of July 22-29.
In August Professor Schenck will
sail for Belgium to collect fossils
and to study formations in import
ant paleontological regions of West
ern Europe. Ho is making this trip, i
which will be of a year's duration, '
as an Advanced Fellow of the Com
mission for Relief in Belgium Edu
cational Foundation, Inc.
Dr. Schenck's special study, one
in which he has been engaged since
1816, and on which he has written
several articles and papers, deals
with fossil shells of the Oligocene i
period, some 5,000,000 years ago. The
greater part of his work on the or
ganic remains of this period was
dene in western Oregon, where he
worked out the succession of life
and determined the former extent
of the Pacific Ocean.
In Europe the investigation will be
the comparison and correlation of
strata there with the results of Pro
fessor Schenck's earlier studies. This
work may result in settling the con
troversy regarding the existence of
(he Oligocene period. In the summer
of 1934 he will visit Sweden to ex
amine important archaeological and
paleontological discoveries.
Dr. Schenck served as Geologic
Aid in the Bureau of Mines in
Manila, Philippines, in 1919-20. He
received the degree of A.B. at the
University of Oregon in 1922, M.A.
in 1923. and Ph.D. at California in
1926, where he taught paleontology
for one year. In the summer of 1924
he became an assistant on the Stan

1 ford Geological Survey, and later
j served here as an instructor. He
| was named Assistant Profes;:ir of
Geology in 1927. He is a member of
several scientific organizations,
among them the Geological Society
of America and the Geological So
ciety of France.
