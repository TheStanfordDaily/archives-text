## SONG OF THE SUCCESSFUL SIRENS 
### OLD DR. ALGAR 
"Senor Dan Cupid apparently has
awakened to the fact that hard times
are on the wane, judging from the
toll he has taken recently at Stan
ford University. As a result of his
biggest single raid on the Farm this
season, eight co-eds have announced
their engagements."—S.F. Chronicle.
"Eighx engagements were an
nounced s'esterday at Stanford Uni
versity by Mr. Campus Cupid who,
it would appear, spent half his time
practicing archery at the Chi Omega
Sorority and the remainder in scat
tering shots over the quad."—S.F.
Examiner.
Our mission here is finished, gals.
No longer need we tarry—
We are the envy of our pals
For we are signed to marry.
So bring on several hundred more,
Let women swamp the place—
We're on the turn and far ahead
In matrimony's race.
Let others wonder how we won
And ape us if they can—
We fished the campus fishpond
And we landed us a MAN!
