## THORNHILL CLOSES PRACTICE SEASON WITH TWO GAMES 
### Oliver Johnston 
j Expecting to throw light on just
what and how much Stanford can
i expect to accomplish in a football
\ way next fall, Coach "Tiny" Thorn
hill will send two strong squads of
1 potential Trojan-tramplers against
| each other at 4:15 o'clock this after -
| r.oon on the practice field.
Eleven members of last fall's pow
erful freshman team will be in the
opposing lineups of the game, which
will wind up Stanford's 1933 spring
workout.
The squad was cut in half on
j Monday and two teams picked from
| each group. The starting lineup was
! tentatively announced as follows:
Team A— Team B—
Moscrip LER Smith
Palamountain LTR Calloway
O'Connor LGR Rouble
Brandin C Muller
Corbus RCL Adams
Lettunich RTL Reynolds
Norgard REL Grunsky
Hoos Q Targhetta
Sim LHR Van Dellen
[ Hamilton RHL ' Reisner
Grayson F Todd
The two teams are fairly well
matched, with Team A having a
slight advantage at the end and half
[ positions.
Two new teams will take the field
at the beginning of the second half.
They will line up as follows:
Team A Team B—
Abrahamson LER Ransom or
Wyman
Holwerda LTR Borton
Kite LGR Cooke
Van Kirk C C. Bates
Tarver RGL Mitchell
Drown RTL Carlson
Sieiner REL Topping or
Packard
Leedy Q Strong
AfTlerbaugh LHR Flippen
White or Lewis RHL Bronstein
, Alustiza F Sears or
Morgan
Team A in this half of the game
seems to hold a slight advantage all
the way down the line and in the
brckfield.
It is not at all unlikely that there
will be many long runs. Bobby
Grayson, with such men as Hamil
ton and Corbus running interference,
looks like a cinch to break away
several times.
Frank Alustiza and \Ray Todd
spurred on by the excitement of a
game should .show up even better
at the lullback jobs than they have
in practice.
Johnny Reisner and Chuck White
at safety positions are likely to run
through eleven men untouched any
time they get the ball. There are
innumerable others who will show
up well and every man is expected
to get a chance.
Admission is free to the public
and spectators are advised to arrive
early if they want a bleacher seat.
Six records, two that had stood
for six years, tumbled at this year's
Southeastern A. A. U. track and
field meet at Tuscaloosa, Ala.

Southeastern A. A. U. track and
field meet at Tuscaloosa, Ala.
j Expecting to throw light on just
what and how much Stanford can
i expect to accomplish in a football
\ way next fall, Coach "Tiny" Thorn
hill will send two strong squads of
1 potential Trojan-tramplers against
| each other at 4:15 o'clock this after -
| r.oon on the practice field.
Eleven members of last fall's pow
erful freshman team will be in the
opposing lineups of the game, which
will wind up Stanford's 1933 spring
workout.
The squad was cut in half on
j Monday and two teams picked from
| each group. The starting lineup was
! tentatively announced as follows:
Team A— Team B—
Moscrip LER Smith
Palamountain LTR Calloway
O'Connor LGR Rouble
Brandin C Muller
Corbus RCL Adams
Lettunich RTL Reynolds
Norgard REL Grunsky
Hoos Q Targhetta
Sim LHR Van Dellen
[ Hamilton RHL ' Reisner
Grayson F Todd
The two teams are fairly well
matched, with Team A having a
slight advantage at the end and half
[ positions.
Two new teams will take the field
at the beginning of the second half.
They will line up as follows:
Team A Team B—
Abrahamson LER Ransom or
Wyman
Holwerda LTR Borton
Kite LGR Cooke
Van Kirk C C. Bates
Tarver RGL Mitchell
Drown RTL Carlson
Sieiner REL Topping or
Packard
Leedy Q Strong
AfTlerbaugh LHR Flippen
White or Lewis RHL Bronstein
, Alustiza F Sears or
Morgan
Team A in this half of the game
seems to hold a slight advantage all
the way down the line and in the
brckfield.
It is not at all unlikely that there
will be many long runs. Bobby
Grayson, with such men as Hamil
ton and Corbus running interference,
looks like a cinch to break away
several times.
Frank Alustiza and \Ray Todd
spurred on by the excitement of a
game should .show up even better
at the lullback jobs than they have
in practice.
Johnny Reisner and Chuck White
at safety positions are likely to run
through eleven men untouched any
time they get the ball. There are
innumerable others who will show
up well and every man is expected
to get a chance.
Admission is free to the public
and spectators are advised to arrive
early if they want a bleacher seat.
Six records, two that had stood
for six years, tumbled at this year's
Southeastern A. A. U. track and
field meet at Tuscaloosa, Ala.
