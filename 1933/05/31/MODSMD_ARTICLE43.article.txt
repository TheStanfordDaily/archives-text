# GRADUATION ENDS TRACK CAREER OF 6 CARD STARS
## 
### 
Six of the nine Stanford men who |
placed in the 1.C.4-A., representing
22 of the 44 Indian points, will grad
uate this June. Captain-elect Gu.s
Meier, John Lyman, and "Slinger"
, Dunn are survivors.
Captain Ben Eastman, fourth in
the 800 meters, Nellie Gray, fourth
in the shot put and discus, Here
Laborde, discus champion, and Bill i
Miller and Bud Deacon, who figured j
in a five-way tie for first in the
pole vault, will receive sheepskins
next month.
Umost without comparison is the i
I intercollegiate record of this quin
tet, who were nevertheless unable
to swing enough points to make up
, for the loss incurred by the failure
to place of Les Hables, Phil Wil
| liams, and Johnny Mottram.
Four of these men, Eastman, Gray, |

Laborde, and Miller, fought their
way to the very top of track recog
nition, positions on the 1932 Ameri
can Olympic team. All four scored
valuable points in the games them
selves. The fifth man, Bud Deacon,
missed the American team by the
smallest of margins.
Few times in history have four
men made the Olympic team from
the same college, and the fact that j
all four were juniors with one more
year of competition following the
international meet makes the rec- :
ord unparalleled.
For Eastman, Gray, Laborde, and
Miller this season has proved some
thing of an anti-climax. All have
been bothered by sickness and in
jury, but their last effort, at last
Saturday's meet, was a creditable
one.
