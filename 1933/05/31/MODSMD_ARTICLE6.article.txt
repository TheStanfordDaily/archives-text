# U.S. Will Seek Fixed Silver Ratio At Meet
## Couzens Agrees To Sail As Sole G.O.P. Delegate 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 30 (A')—On
the eve of its sailing, the American
delegation to the world economic
conference received instruction to
day to seek an improvement in the
economic status of silver.
Simultaneously with a disclosure
that Senator Couzens has consented
to accept a place on the delegation,
the House Foreign Affairs Commit
tee approved a measure urging that
America's spokesmen at the confer
ence work for stabilization of mone
tary exchanges and seek an inter
national bi-metallism agreement at
a fixed ratio between gold and sil
ver.
Lending emphasis to today's ac
tion in the House committee, the
Senate several weeks ago voted that
the delegation be urged to seek an
improvement in the price of silver.
Pleased at having obtained a
Republican to serve on the dele
gation, President Roosevelt was
understood to be seeking another,
possibly Representative James W.
Wadsworth of New York.
Undiscouraged by a feeling voiced
elsewhere in the capital that little
more than an agreement for the
stabilization of foreign exchanges
would be achieved at London, Sec
retary Hull was looking forward also
to reciprocal tariff adjustments that
might remove present obstacles to
world commerce.
