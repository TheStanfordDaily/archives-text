## Clapp's Petition Aimed To Show Need of Revising Election Board RULES TO BE CHANGED Three Candidates Close In First Preferences 
### B Kellogg 
Jerry Trautraan stood undisputed
winner of the A.S.S.U. election yes
terday afternoon when President
Bill Corbus announced that Austin
Clapp had withdrawn his recount
petition, filed and accepted at a
Tuesday midnight meeting of the
Executive Committee.
The petition was retracted, Clapp
said, because it had served its pur
pose-that of bringing the problem
of revising the procedure of the
Election Board before the campus.
At the same time President Cor
bus announced the retraction Clapp
issued a statement quoted in part
here:
"While no dissatisfaction with
ilie results of the election as shown
by tlu; first count was felt by
those who supported the petition
for a recount, the primary pur
pose of that demand was to focus
the attention of the campus on the
problem of revising the procedure
of the Election Hoard in perform
ing its duties.
'"There were no serious infrac
tions of the present rules .... There
is no implication that anyone who j
took part in (he tabulation was de- :
libcrately influenced by partisan
ship.
Amendment To lie Made
". . . . Those behind the move- j
nicnt have been assured that im- j
mediate steps will be taken to pro- j
vide a suitable amendment to the |
constitution . . . ."
Willi a close 117 vote margin, j
Trautman was pushed into the pres- I
idcncy by a determined insurgent .
machine that split Hall and Row j
parties to put a man representing a ;
coalition group in office.
Candidates Close
All three candidates appeared at
loggerheads early in the counting
and »maintained this position
throughout. The* balloting closed!
with the three men very close on I
the counting of the first preferences,'
but as second choices were added ■
Trautman slowly forged into the i
winning lead.
As the last obstacle was removed i
President-Elect Trautman thanked |
all those who voted for him and the [
men who backed his campaign.
