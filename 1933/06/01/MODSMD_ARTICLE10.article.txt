# WILBUR LAUDS FRATERNITIES-- "IF WELL-RUN"
## President Announces Stand In Speech Before Row-Faculty Banquet 
### 
| Quelling rumors that he stands
| opposed to the fraternities, President
j Ray Lyman Wilbur stated last night
j at a Faculty-Row dinner that he be-

I lievcd that the fraternities were
[ j good in so far as when run cor-
J rectly, they promote the self-man
i agement needed to get on in the
' world.
k I President Wilbur concluded his
' talk by saying that if anything hap
pens to fraternities, it will come as
a result of their own actions in not
working together for their common
j benefit.
i Donn Tatum, incoming chairman
| of the Interfraternity Board, outlined
. | the Board's plans for next year,
i Recognizing the fact that the prob
lem of junior transfers will be more
important than ever, the fraternities
I arc working out a plan in conjunc
' tion with the eating clubs whereby
a central office will be established to
1 j act as an impartial representative
01' .these groups for contact with the
transfers.
Normal contact of a public or in
â–  formal nature between fraternity
i and new lower division men is per
missible at any time, Tatum pointed
out. It is hoped that the Interfra
ternity Council will give a broad
j interpretation of this rule which
| will do away with any necessity for
I illegal rushing.
] Ike Livermore, retiring chairman
|of the Interfraternity Board, pre
| sided at the dinner. Other speakers
| were George B. Culver, John E. Mc-
Dowell, and Judd Crary, Stanford
j alumnus.
