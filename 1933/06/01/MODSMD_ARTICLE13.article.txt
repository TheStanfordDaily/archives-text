Ex Committee Appoints
Abe Mellinkoff To
Head Vol. 84
The Executive Committee in
j a midnight session last night
refused to approve the election
of Don Douglass and awarded
the editorship of Volume 84
to Abe Mellinkoff.
Mellinkoff had protested
the election held last Tuesday,
charging that undue influence
and coercion had been uti
lized. The count of the elec
tion had been Douglass 21,
Mellinkoff 18, Jack Allen 14.
Mellinkoff'.* three-point at
tack was:
(1 ) The presence of a for
mer Daily editor at the polls
exercised a baneful influence.
(2) Two staff members
had been "unfairly awarded
votes."
(3) "Trades" had been
prevalent in the voting.
The appointment of Jack
Allen as managing editor was
also rejected.
The Ex Committee's state
ment follows:
In the best interests of the Asso
ciated Students of Stanford University
and the Stanford Daily, the Execu
tive Committee after due considera
tion and deliberation, after careful
cross-examination of competent wit
nesses, and thorough investigation
decided that the election and ap
pointment of the Daily Editor and
the Managing Editor be rejected, as
submitted to it by the Publications
Council. The Ex Comittec is within
its constitutional power as set forth on
pp. 29 and 54 of the handbook. To
avoid any question of usurpation,
however, Dean Kirkwood of the law
school, in interpreting the A.5.5.U.
Constitution has fully sanctioned the
legality of the Executive Committee's
action.
The Comittec has had both candi
dates before it. It has investigated
their qualifications, and considering
all factors, feels that Abe Mellinkoff
will make a better editor for Volume
84 of the Daily, and therefore ap
points him to this office.
