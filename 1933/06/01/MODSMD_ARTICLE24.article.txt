Exacting surveyors worked sys
tematically back and forth in the
pytio and exterior grounds of the
Lamson home at 622 Salvatierra un
til dusk last night in an effort to
stcure tangible organization of the
, theories concerning the precise
cause of the mysterious bathtub
i death of Mrs. Allene Thorpe Lamson
Tuesday morning.
Meanwhile David Lamson was
I still held in the San Jose jail for
further questioning. District At
torney Fred Thomas said that lit*
would file no chargcs against
Lamson until a more intensive
investigation had been made.
Thomas added, however, that if
' Lamson's counsel attempts to se
cure a writ for his release, a
charge of murder will immediately
be filed to hold Lamson.
OTHER DEVELOPMENTS
1—Three conflicting theories pre
1 sent themselves to puzzle those fol
lowing the case here, (a) That Mrs.
Lamson, known to have been in poor
health and subject to frequent faint
ing spells, collapsed in the bathtub,
striking her head on a faucet or
similar protuberance, meeting in
stantaneous death, (b) That a mys
, terious stranger gained access to
i the interior of the home through
the patio entrance and the French
i doors leading to the living-room,
committing the violent crime inside,
(c) That David Lamson himself was
responsible for her death, which is
| the original police hypothesis.
2—John L. C. Vanderlip, business
j graduate student here, told police
I that he saw a "shabby stranger"
| near the Lamson home at about
o'clock Monday night and 7:55
| o'clock Tuesday morning. Mrs. Lam
son is believed to have died at some
time between 9 and 10 o'clock Tues
day morning. Vanderlip told au-
I thorities that he became so suspi
: cious of this marked character that
he hurried to catch up with him
Tuesday morning, but lost him on
Salvatierra street.
•» —A second man was in the
; home of Mrs. Lamson a short time
before she was found dead in her
bathtub, according to a statement
last night in San Jose by former
Congressman Arthur M. Free,
counsel for Lamson. "He was there
before Mrs. Lamson met death,"
Free said, "but I am sure the pass
ing was the result of an accidental
fall. I do not intend to bring him
into the case."
4—Lamson himself, prostrated
with grief, expressed his belief that
i his wife was murdered in cold
blood. He declared, according to a
United Press dispatch, that one <>f
the French doors was stained with
| blood and open when he entered tin;
house to answer the doorbell, al
thought it had customarily been
closed. Police admitted the possi
bility that a prowler might have en
tered the house while Lamson was
working in the yard, entirely un
observed by him.
5—Friends and neighbors of the
young couple were unanimous in
the assertion that Mrs. Lamson
fell and was killed accidentally.
characterizing the pair as an "ideal
couple," and pointing out the fact
that they were always together,
happy and very devoted to one
another.
Showing that Lamson could not
have seen anyone enter the house
from where he was working, re
porters were quick to note a seven- i
foot wall of solid concrete one foot
thick surrounding the patio behind
the house. Beyond this another lat
tice-work fence separated the house
from the yard beyond the patio in
which Lamson was raking debris to
gether before the discovery of the
body. Trees and shrubs added to
these obstacles prevented anyone in
the yard either from seeing or hear
ing an intruder break into the rear ,
of the house.
7—A guard was placed on duty to
keep all outsiders off the premises
yesterday.
No new statement was forthcom
ing last night from the sheriff's of
fice in San Jose.
Date for the coroner's inquest has
not yet been set.
