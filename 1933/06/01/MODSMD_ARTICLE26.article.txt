# "Insider's" Eye-View Of the "Quad" Appearing Today
## 
### 
Only through a straining tug at the fraternal lie which
more or less hinds Ihc brotherhood of student editcfrs and
managers was il possible tor the Daily to get a look at a
copy ot the I!KJ.'J Quad which arrived on the campus yes- :
Icrdav afternoon. Thus, with all the eagerness typical of
the "insider, the Daily takes advantage of its opportunity
this morning to tell the campus what a line publication it
considers Ihc Quad which will be distributed to purchasers!
today.
From cover to cover, modernistic reminders of the tra
ditional red covers of a decade ago, the HKJiJ Qikkl is a
volume ot exceptional beauty and exceedingly good taste.
The division pages present unique and artistic conceptions
ot the structural beauty that is Stanford's, while the page J
layouts and border decorations are strikingly original.
Aside from its workmanlike editing, which places il in
the fore of all the Farm's annuals, il is doubtful whether
another year has ever produced a Quad so truly appre
ciative and expressive of Stanford's individuality among)
universities. To the editorial staff of IIKM, the Daily can
only extend its congratulations for so thoroughlv capturing
the spirit of Stanford within the boards of their volume.
With only a few copies remaining unsold, and with the 1
inevitable enthusiasm with which the book will be received I
today, il seems certain that the Quad staff will have sue-!
ceeded financially as well as editorially. Which will be a|
case of merit reaping its just reward.
