# A 						Fight Against Crime Which Must Begin with a Fight Against Apathy
## 
### 
Ono of Hie San Francisco dailies broke out yesterday j
morning wilh its almost monthly attempt to light the wave
of kidnapping and crime which is sweeping the country.!
In a half-page editorial il pointed out, as practically every)
olher paper in the country has done, the necessity of a!
definite stand against the criminals and racketeers of the |
land.
For years newspapers, and the public generally, have'
made this obvious stand and year l>v vcar crime has grown
m strength. II is a gallant stand, but futile in the extreme.
It has become not so much a fight against crime as a fight
against public apathy.
The latest and virulent form America's superiority in
crime has taken is kidnapping. II gained its current popu-1
larily wilh the Lindbergh affair and, like every olher good
money-making scheme* has gained adherents rapidly.
Following Ihe murder of the flyer's son the hue and cry !
was terrific. Il was stated thai the "American people will
never forget or rest until the murderers are jailed."" Less
than six months laler Ihe affair was practically forgotten
and Ihe men are slill at large. Nor has anything been done
to make the penally for such a crime more severe.
This is not an isolated case. Following every such bru
tal crime the whole country rises in indignation and joins |
in a determination to make any recurrence impossible, j
Rarely is anything tangible done, and before the next out
break Ihe whole matter has been dropped and forgotten. l
Newspapers and individuals will continue to attack
(lime but crime will continue lo grow until the lime when
the apathetic altitude of the mob is overcome.
