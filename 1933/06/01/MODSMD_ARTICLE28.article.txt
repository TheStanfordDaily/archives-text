# Just in Case A Million Dollars Pops Up
## 
### 
Not every senior who hopes lo graduate this month has
very large hopes of inheriting a million dollars in the next j
few years, or even ;i few thousand. Hut in case anything i
like that were to happen, and here's luck, it would he a
pretty tine thing for about everyone concerned if the senior !
had pledged a fair-sized amount to the senior endowment
fund.
These endowment funds up to this year have been ad
ministered as an emergency fund by the administration of
the I niversity. With the ('.lass of '33, the fund is to become
a scholarship endowment for the special benefit of some
deserving freshman.
Seniors, of course, should remember that their pledges
can be revoked if and when linaneial conditions make it
necessary.
A hearty-sized endowment fund by the graduating class
would be a tine gesture on the part of ",V,\ as well as a
worthy bequest to students of the future.
