### ABE MELLINKOFF 
I have never been able to suffi
, ciently bury my ego to adopt so
' I cialism. I try to at times; but there
it bobs up like a peculiar aunt with
,'halitosis. However, something comes
■, along like the Morgan investigation;
I and immediately I begin to feel that
! money is the root of all evil. And
1 thai all roots should be uprooted
i and burned.
There is nothing inherently dis
! honest in some of the things Morgan
did. He merely gave his "friends" a
j chance to buy stocks at a wholesale
| price. If my neighbor sold groceries,
' and gave me an opportunity to buy
i a dozen jars of stuffed green olives
! at a reduced price, the chances are
I I would accept. That is what Mor
gan did. He gave some people the
: opportunity to buy stuffed olives at
i a greatly reduced price.
There is only one difference be
-1 tween Mr. Morgan's olives and my
i neighbor's. My neighbor lives next
door; Mr. -Morgan lives next door
j to anyone who has money or influ
ence. Secondly, Mr. Morgan's olives
I are very choice—they are large,
j juicy, and gold-filled. For the dozen
j bottles of Seville olives that my
! neighbor gives me, I might let him
[ use my lawnmower or my hedge
j shears. Very little more. That is all
I he would expect.
But if Mr. Morgan drops $10 000
j in my pocket, I might be tempted
! to do a lot more than let him use

MORGAN—MASTER OF MEN

1 my newly sharpened mower on his
rocky lawn. Especially when I knew
that if I were appreciative, there
might be more Morgan gold-filled
oli\ es. A financial elephant never
forgets and what a gigantic elephant
Morgan is. His memory must be ex
cellent.
That Morgan's deals when made
with men in public office are nothing
less than bribes seems evident. If I
hand you a five-dollar bill for three
fifty, the implication of a gift to tlje
sum of a dollar and a half seems
quite clear. If stock is handed over
the implication is just as clear. That
is cxactly what Morgan did. That
Roosevelt must clear out of his ad
ministration every man tainted with
the Morgan money seems clear. The
future success of his administration,
is at stake.
But getting back to socialism.
What is the relationship between |
high-class, big-time Morgan graft
and Karl Marx? Simply that if huge
enterprise were governmentally con- '
trolled, there would be no Morgan j
to give stocks at sub-par prices to |
his friends. He would have no l
friends; no stock to give. My hu- j
manitarian blood begins to rise; the j
prospect is beautiful.
But that is socialism's best argu- |
ment—the nifty beauty of it all. |
How it would work; or whether it j
would work is a more annoying j
pioblem.

Morgan is. His memory must be ex
cellent.
That Morgan's deals when made
with men in public office are nothing
less than bribes seems evident. If I
hand you a five-dollar bill for three
fifty, the implication of a gift to tlje
sum of a dollar and a half seems
quite clear. If stock is handed over
the implication is just as clear. That
is cxactly what Morgan did. That
Roosevelt must clear out of his ad
ministration every man tainted with
the Morgan money seems clear. The
future success of his administration,
is at stake.
But getting back to socialism.
What is the relationship between |
high-class, big-time Morgan graft
and Karl Marx? Simply that if huge
enterprise were governmentally con- '
trolled, there would be no Morgan j
to give stocks at sub-par prices to |
his friends. He would have no l
friends; no stock to give. My hu- j
manitarian blood begins to rise; the j
prospect is beautiful.
But that is socialism's best argu- |
ment—the nifty beauty of it all. |
How it would work; or whether it j
would work is a more annoying j
pioblem.
I have never been able to suffi
, ciently bury my ego to adopt so
' I cialism. I try to at times; but there
it bobs up like a peculiar aunt with
,'halitosis. However, something comes
■, along like the Morgan investigation;
I and immediately I begin to feel that
! money is the root of all evil. And
1 thai all roots should be uprooted
i and burned.
There is nothing inherently dis
! honest in some of the things Morgan
did. He merely gave his "friends" a
j chance to buy stocks at a wholesale
| price. If my neighbor sold groceries,
' and gave me an opportunity to buy
i a dozen jars of stuffed green olives
! at a reduced price, the chances are
I I would accept. That is what Mor
gan did. He gave some people the
: opportunity to buy stuffed olives at
i a greatly reduced price.
There is only one difference be
-1 tween Mr. Morgan's olives and my
i neighbor's. My neighbor lives next
door; Mr. -Morgan lives next door
j to anyone who has money or influ
ence. Secondly, Mr. Morgan's olives
I are very choice—they are large,
j juicy, and gold-filled. For the dozen
j bottles of Seville olives that my
! neighbor gives me, I might let him
[ use my lawnmower or my hedge
j shears. Very little more. That is all
I he would expect.
But if Mr. Morgan drops $10 000
j in my pocket, I might be tempted
! to do a lot more than let him use

MORGAN—MASTER OF MEN

1 my newly sharpened mower on his
rocky lawn. Especially when I knew
that if I were appreciative, there
might be more Morgan gold-filled
oli\ es. A financial elephant never
forgets and what a gigantic elephant
Morgan is. His memory must be ex
