CRITICISM OF CRITICISM OF i
CRITICISM—A note in explana
tion if not in palliation.
Any individual who attempts to
edit and contribute to a column of I
criticism inevitably finds himself the ;
target of critics of his judgment or
method. My sincere and, I hope, j
justified opinions have appeared J
frequently hereabout during the past j
i year.
Now that the time has come for!
me to retire in favor of a new Re
viewer, it seems appropriate that
there should be some clear explana
tion of several points of controversy.
The Reviewer has been criticized j
puzzlingly as "too technical" and
"overlong." To the first of these \
charges I can only say that criticism
can hardly satisfy itself with a
glance at the advance publicity, and
that if an analysis of plot, discretion,
and acting is "technical" that such j
criticism is the only comment which»
has any right to appear as such.
Such analysis takes more space'
than does enthusiasm; the Review- 1
er's comment has, in the main, been i
cut to a minimum. That the com
ment has occasionally been some-1
what extended may be explained on
the ground that the subject war-1
ranted it.
That the comment has been con- !
fined largely to the cinema has (
troubled me. Bui both because the
cinema is utilized as a means of
general entertainment oftener here
about than, say, the novel, justifies
the fact in part. And because the
< nominal occupation of a student oc- ]
cupies a great deal of time, there has ]
not been sufficient time left for Ire-,
quent or serious contemplation of |
the books which deserve to be com- j
, mented upon.
In closing, an admonition to the |
competent Miss Chapin: dorrl be J
! afraid of the inevitable managerial J
protests. In any case, the purpose !
of criticism should be kept in mind, i
I have not been convinced that The |
Reviewer has any great power in j
directing attention to or away from
the subjects of its attention. The I
general public—and I judge from
personal experience as well as ob- j
servation —goes to the cinema not j
to find consistent entertainment but
largely out of habit. I approached
and have conducted The Reviewer
, somewhat more for the purpose of
! expressing my own carefully con
. sidered opinions than as a duty or
guide of readers who, however they i

might agree with the comment
therein, would, like myself, go to a
picture whether they know it to be
good or bad, because the cinema
was no more eseapable than meals.
The year has been entertaining
and instructive. Such comic inci
dents as the Jenny and Earnfred
squabbles undeniably added zest to
the more routine duties, however
well or badly justified my stand
may have been.
I am happy, now, to make way for
you, Billy, a witty, perceptive
critic, with a background in criti
cism and the forms of drama which
will enhance your comment. Don't,
as I have, lose your sense of humor.
Maintain that comically expressed
detachment so frequently evident in
the presence of mediocrity. It will
be invaluable when, in a flurry of
villainous repetition, comment must
be sustained. —Sandoe
