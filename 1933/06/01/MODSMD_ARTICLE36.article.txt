It appears that Brick Morse and
your own universally beloved cor
respondent were not the only ones
thrilled to their palpitating core by
"our" track win back East. No, Mr.
Robert F. Kelley of New York must
be added to the category.
Mr. Kelley writes a column for
(he New York Times entitled
"With College Athletes." And on
May 21. he blossomed forth with
the following paragraphical tidbit:
(Concerning the 1.C.4-A. meet,
which was then .still a future event)
"The Trojans are bringing their
usual array of champions and near
champions (East with them) in
cluding Ben Eastman, Nelson Gray,
Bill Graber, Bill Miller, Von Osdel,
and Bill Kiesel."
Yes, Mr. Kelley must have been
considerably cheered by the vic
tory of "our" Trojans.
A little digging here and there
finally revealed the truth concern
ing the suddenly dropped wrestling
petition. And here it is.
The petitioners withdrew the
petition from the Ex Committee
after the Committee had agreed
to |>ii( up an amendment at the
coming election that would legal
ize wrestling as a second-class
minor sport. This action followed
news relayed from the B.A.C. that
the Hoard would be unahlc to af
ford to support wrestling.
The Board said that wrestling
would cost 2000 additional dollars
per annum, and that this was no
time for new expenditures. And,
oven though the Ex Committee made
wrestling a minor sport seven limes
a week and twice on Sundays, there
would be no wrestling unless the
B.A.C. said "yes."
The original plan was to have
wrestling continue as it now is but
with awards given the wrestlers.
The instructor in charge of the
wrestling gym classes would act
as assistant wrestling coach under
Koyce Long.
Dr. Storey computed the addition
al expense this way. lie said that
Long was too old to wrestle himself
with the team any more, and that
either an assistant or a regular
coach would need to be hired. And
ihere would be the expense for new
equipment and a negligible dis
bursement for the letters themselves.
When it was suggested to Dr.
Storey that wrestling could con
tinue as it now is, he agreed with
the scheme as a possibility if an
instructor-coach to replace Ted
llill could he found.
"But," continued the doctor, "even
ii r an instructor is found, the wres
tlers will soon be demanding a
regular coach. They will consider it
unfair that their sport is treated
less well than other sports on a
similar plane. And it would be un
fair not to give them a coach if the
sport is a regular minor one, while
if it remains as it is, there will be
no need for such a coach."
And A1 Masters said, "Periodi
cally, wrestlers want recognition.
Then the interest in the sport dies,
and wrestling must once again he
relegated to the status of a gym
class."
There is merit to these arguments, j
and since the interest in wrestling 1
seemed to lie almost entirely in the
breast of one man, the Ex Commit
tee acted wisely in refusing the pe
-1 ition.
Personally, however, I believe
that wrestling could retain its
present position as regards equip
ment and coaching, and also he
given minor sport awards. But
personally, I'm not the petitioners, J
not the Ex Committee, nor the
Board of Athletic Control.
