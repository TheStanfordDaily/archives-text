# Mural Relays Decision Left To Committee
## Question Breakers Victory Over El Toro Club 
### 
Ending as have most Stanford
contests in the past few days—with
a "gripe"—Intramural Relays con
cluded toda/. The announced win
ner is Breakers with 22 points; El

I '
Toro, second with 18; Encina 3E,
third with 15. Final decision is to
be postponed until adjudged by the
Intramural Committee.
Encina 3E took the first event of
the day, the 4-man 880, in almost
record-shattering time—1:34.8. The
team was again Burris, Harper, Mac-
Kenzie, and Beckett. Breaker* was
second by about 10 yards with Toro
and Chi Psi father to the rear.
Breakers Lead
When the last event, the shuttle
hurdles, started, Breakers had 17
points and Toro was but one behind.
A win for either would decide the
carnival. In a sloppy race timed at
65.4, which is exceedingly slow,
Breakers romped home, the winner
b>. a few yards. Toro was next, fol
lowed by the Phi Kaps and Chi Psi's.
Toro men soon found from the
"tapper" that a Breakers man had
set off before the signal. Breakers
rapidly countered from another
semi-official's account that, due to
an oversight, one Toro man had not
been made to leap a hurdle which
h.ad been knocked down but not
se + again.
Others Score
Which made an impasse, and
throws the decisions to the 'commit
tee. Both eating clubs declared
themselves agreeable to a re-run
ning of the race. Toro, of course,
being put one point behind when
the event started stands to win if
Breakers are disqualified, or at least
a chance if the race is re-run.
The only other teams besides the
first three to score during the entire
three-day carnival were the Phi
Kaps, who accounted for 7 digits,
and the Chi Psi's, wbo garnered 3.
