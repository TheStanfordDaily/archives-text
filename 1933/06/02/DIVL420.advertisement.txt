i
IN
THE GOTHAM SHOP
The response to our May Pre-Inflation Sale was most extraordinary, and
for this evidence of ihe approval of our patrons, we are profoundly grateful.
'
Close observation and analysis of tins sale has led to the conclusion that
we can serve and satisfy a far greater number of customers than we have
served heretofore.
Palo Alto evidently is fast becoming a shopping center for Peninsula
women. We intend therefore to adopt the merchandising methods prac
ticed by far-seeing merchants in the larger centers of population. This calls
for a policy of carrying larger stocks and making smaller profits for quick
turnover.
Therefore, from now or, we will maintain throughout The Gotham Shop
comprehensive stocks of the Eatest Apparel and Accessories in demand at
the moment. This merchandise wili be priced so attractively that your temp
tation to buy need never be resisted.
Only quality merchandise, priced at the smallest margin of profit, will
be offered —never will we show indifferent merchandise, on which both
store and customer must suffer ultimate loss.
This new policy has for its objective a wider field of activity for The
Gotham Shop. Our motive is a three-fold one:
1. To render such useful service as to promote interest, happiness, and
benefit to greater numbers of people.
I
2. To distribute a greater volume of merchandise, and thereby stimulate
industry and manufacture.
3. To contribute our share to the "New Deal" for city, state, and nation
by enlivening the healthy, needful activity, which will allay all sense of fear
or lack, and lift depression.
