Description
TO STANFORD STUDENTS AND
THEIR FRIENDS:
I have been asked to write an advertisement describing the
Canficld Gardens and inviting the students to come and enjoy these
warm afternoons and evenings. These beautiful gardens, a portion
of a large estate in Mcnlo Park, challenge all attempts at description.
A large dance pavilion has been erected under the massive oaks
and a popular orchestra has been securcd for dancing. An adobe bar
built in 1876 has been remodeled from which refreshments arc
served. The sandwiches and drinks, it is said, will rival the beauty
of the natural setting of the beautiful gardens.
The Canficld Cardcns can be truly called the "Beauty Spot" of 1
the Peninsula."
