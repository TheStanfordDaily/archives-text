# Ex Committee Accepts Petition Asking Recall Of Mellinkoff As Editor
## Publications Board Repeats Decision In Favor Of Douglass 
### 
Meeting at a special session late
yesterday afternoon, the retiring
Publications Council and the 1933-34
council, decided that the most em
phatic action they could take was to
reiterate their decision of Tuesday
when they unanimously awarded
Don Douglass the Daily editorship
with a 7-0 count.
At the close of the session four
members of the council issued
statements. Ray Hanson .editor of j
the 1933 Quad, said:
"I feel that the action of the i
Executive Committee is a direct
blow at the Publications Council in j
that it was the council and NOT the
Daily staff that elected Don Doug
lass. There was not at any time uny j
politics influencing the council's de- j
cLsion.
"Under the circumstances I feel
that the only fair move would be to
call a re-election of the Daily staff,
and if both candidates get more
than one-third votes necessary to.
send the matter to council, let it j
handle the matter according to the j
constitutional provision."
Ed Bunting, manager of the 1933
Quad, said:
"Those with several years of ex
perience in publication affairs should
be in the best position to administer
these affairs. Any unwarranted in
terference with their judgment is'
certainly not justified."
Don Cameron, editor of the 1933 j
Chaparral, said:
"I believe that that the Executive
Committee went too far in appoint
ing an editor for the Daily. What i 4
should have done was to have in
stigated a thorough investigation and
then ordered a re-election.
"Members of the Publications
Council are, I believe, more compe- 1
tent to name the editor of the Daily."
Bob Savage, manager of the 1933 •
Chaparral, said:
"While the Executive Committee
has the veto power over the Pub
lications Council I don't think they
should arbitrarily name a new
editor.
"Tlie council is more qualified to i
pick an editor, in my opinion. The
power of the Ex Committee to veto
action of the council is accepted as
being legal and deserved but instead
of arbitrarily picking an editor it
should have moved to hold a re
election or leave the matter with
the council."
