# Statements Of Students On Election
## Three Campus Leaders Express Opinions 
### 
Regarding the action of the Execu
tive Committee in refusing to accept i
the Publications Council's election 1
of Don Douglass to the editorship o£ j
Volume 34 of the Daily and in ap
pointing Abe Mellinkoff to the post,
student leaders last night made the j
following statements:
Jack Redhead: "In the election i
lost Tuesday, the student body;
elected candidates running on the |
platform, "Undergraduates for un- j
| dergraduate offices.' When the Ex
| Committee refused to approve the I
appointment of Douglass as editor
of the Daily it did not heed the
wishes of the A.S.S.U. as expressed
in the last election."
Milo Tally, member of the Elec- |
I tion Board and official director of
j the last Daily polling:
"One of the major charges of the
Executive Committee against the I
validity of the election of Don
Douglass was that a former Daily
Editor was present at the polls dur
! ing the election, and was there exer
cising coercive influence upon the j
i voters.
I
'I wish now to explain that said ]
! former Daily editor was sitting near)
! myself and my assistant during the' 1
election at my okeh for the purpose
of identifying the voters, whom I
; did not know. There is nothing ir
•vgular about this. It is necessary,
; and always has been. Furthermore, j
said former Daily editor did not
exert any coercive influence, or even
watch how the staff members voted.
"This charge was made by Abe
Mellinkoff, and the Executive Com
mittee asked a staff member wheth- j
1 or it was justified. The staff mem
ber explained that the former Editor
was there with my okeh, and that I
there was nothing irregular about it, 1
and referred the Executive Commit
tee to me. The Ex Committee did 1
, not approach me, but continued to j
use the point as one of the major
charges against the validity of the 1
i election.
"I had to seek out the student
I body president yesterday afternoon, 1
alter Abe Mellinkoff had been in
stalled by the committee. Only then,
after it was all over, did the presi
dent ask me about it."
Kerb Sanderson: "The Publica
tions Council has been in a position
for over a year to study tho qualifi
: cations of the men competing for the
' position of editor and decided unani
mously in favor of one man. The,
Executive Committee in a closed
' session decided in a few hours' time
which man had the qualifications for
the office and reversed the decision.
This is almost psychic."
