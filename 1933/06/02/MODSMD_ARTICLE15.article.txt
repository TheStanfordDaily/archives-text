A petition bearing 392 signatures
j of students requesting the recall of
; Abe Mellinkoff as editor of the Daily
1 for the first term of the next school
year was accepted by the Ex Com
mittee in special session last night,
; but no date was set for the student
body election.
Mellinkoff was named editor over
Don Douglass at a previous mid
; night session of the committee Wed
| nesday, when the governing body
refused to accept the minutes of tho
| publications council and selected
Mellinkoff, who had been defeated
in the Daily election by a margin
I of 21 to 18, but qualified for a pub
lications council vote. The seven
members of the publications council
: voted unanimously for Douglass.
According to the A.S.S.U. consti
tution, an election must take place
i within 14 days from the date that a
petition is presented to the Ex Com
mittee. Thii*teen days remain in this
quarter. The selection of a date for
i special elect ions must be made by
| the Ex Committee, the constitution
; states. No indication of the probable
date, if there is to be one, was made
1 at the meeting.
In an effort to clear up future
situations, the committee appointed
a group to look into the possibilities
of changing the A.S.S.U. constitution
by-laws regarding elections of the
Daily editors. Headed by Marvie
Kahn, the following men were
picked: Chuck Otis, Dave Packard,
Fritz Goodwin, and Bill Corbus, ex
officio.
