# Reduced to Arbsurdity, A Convention Meets Compliance

### 
Dear Abo:
Woll, yon put i! ovor, Abo. You've established a now
order, old Bull Sessionor, From now on a man doesn't
havo lo bo a journalist of llio old school, or of any school,
to win the editorship of our mutually beloved Daily. Hut
thai man must have a peculiar training nevertheless, lie
must have the ability, either cultivated or innate, to con
vince a "representative" group of students of facts which
do not exist, lie must have the quality of simon-purity
foremost among his characteristics of general demeanor,
mannerisms, and associations. It probably wouldn't be
necessary, but it would help tremendously, if the man
had had a bit of legal training, which would enable him
to win the editorship through legal technicality or court
room oratory. Wouldn't it, Abe?
It's a hell of a thing lo say, Abe, but I can't honestly
give you all the old gull that a retiring editor usually
hands out to his successor in congratulatory language.
I can't do it, and neither could any other journalist of the
"old school," or of any journalistic school. You might not
understand all 1 would have to say about the principles of
make-up, of news values, of news writing, or copy reading,
of typo stylo, of lots of things that the ordinary editor
knows as well as his own name.
About all 1 can say to you, personally, Abe—in Ibis
column, tha-t is is lhal you put it over in fine style. You
have a line head on your shoulders, and you certainly
used it. You tied us all up in knots, Abo, with your legal
mind. You saw that you could gain a certain advantage
over a group of poor, blundering newspaper men, and you
took advantage of your big chance.
As for the Daily, I can call kinder words to my com
mand. In the four years that I havo spent on the staff
I have acquired a sentimental sort of loyally for the old
rag, and I hope that it prospers in the years to come. I
hope that il will have many editors of higher calibre then
those already represented in its tiles, including myself. 1
hope, for the sake of the Daily, that you turn out to be a
much bettor editor than 1 honestly believe you will be.
And, after all, Abe, I'll wager that a few years from now
you'll he laughing at all the etl'oM you extended to gel
yourself the job of l)\u v editor.
And taht's about all,
Fritz.

much bettor editor than 1 honestly believe you will be.
And, after all, Abe, I'll wager that a few years from now
you'll he laughing at all the etl'oM you extended to gel
yourself the job of l)\u v editor.
And taht's about all,

Dear Abo:
Woll, yon put i! ovor, Abo. You've established a now
order, old Bull Sessionor, From now on a man doesn't
havo lo bo a journalist of llio old school, or of any school,
to win the editorship of our mutually beloved Daily. Hut
thai man must have a peculiar training nevertheless, lie
must have the ability, either cultivated or innate, to con
vince a "representative" group of students of facts which
do not exist, lie must have the quality of simon-purity
foremost among his characteristics of general demeanor,
mannerisms, and associations. It probably wouldn't be
necessary, but it would help tremendously, if the man
had had a bit of legal training, which would enable him
to win the editorship through legal technicality or court
room oratory. Wouldn't it, Abe?
It's a hell of a thing lo say, Abe, but I can't honestly
give you all the old gull that a retiring editor usually
hands out to his successor in congratulatory language.
I can't do it, and neither could any other journalist of the
"old school," or of any journalistic school. You might not
understand all 1 would have to say about the principles of
make-up, of news values, of news writing, or copy reading,
of typo stylo, of lots of things that the ordinary editor
knows as well as his own name.
About all 1 can say to you, personally, Abe—in Ibis
column, tha-t is is lhal you put it over in fine style. You
have a line head on your shoulders, and you certainly
used it. You tied us all up in knots, Abo, with your legal
mind. You saw that you could gain a certain advantage
over a group of poor, blundering newspaper men, and you
took advantage of your big chance.
As for the Daily, I can call kinder words to my com
mand. In the four years that I havo spent on the staff
I have acquired a sentimental sort of loyally for the old
rag, and I hope that it prospers in the years to come. I
hope that il will have many editors of higher calibre then
those already represented in its tiles, including myself. 1
hope, for the sake of the Daily, that you turn out to be a
much bettor editor than 1 honestly believe you will be.
And, after all, Abe, I'll wager that a few years from now
you'll he laughing at all the etl'oM you extended to gel
yourself the job of l)\u v editor.
And taht's about all,
Fritz.
