# Group Scores In Shaw Play
## 
### 
Writing an impressive finis to an
impressive series of play readings,
Sword and Sandals last night pre
sented Shaw's "Major Barbara" to a
capacity paying audience. A rather
l;.lky play, the work was consider
ably enlivened by the excellent
work of the readers.
Peg Converse and Grove D;iy,
bearing the weight of the opus, were
entirely convincing and capable, as
was James Sandoe in a comic part.
Paul Crary, Virginia Clemens, and
Robert Brauns were all excellent in
widely varying roles.
