# A 						Trusting Barber And A Suspicious University
## 
### 
The administration is constantly socking for more co
operation and sincere good feeling between it and the
student body, it asks a deeper Stanford spirit and vet il
fails miserably in its effort when il refuses to put any
trust in the individual student.
Kverv year the Stanford Cellar piles up a neat profit
on the tines from unsettled checks. The one dollar netted
on every check which bounces back for anv reason is, as
every econ. student knows, "unearned and unreasonable
profit." An outside institution would have every reason to
protect itself in this manner but the Cellar has the I'ni
versilv authorities to insure payment of any bad check.
The system is a pure money-making scheme instituted by
a store which is supposed to be an integral part of Stan
ford but which seems always to put profit above service.
The I nion barber, who for years has cashed checks
for Stanford men, even up to the final day of the quarter,
without any threat of a fine, remembers only two occa
sions when he has been unable to collect on bad checks.
I'nlike the Cellar, he recognizes the importance of trust,
lie has built up a good trade and a friendly feeling by this
method. The Cellar, on the other hand, has a practical
monopoly of campus trade, with accompanying monopoly
prices, and lakes advantage of its situation to be ob
noxiously suspicious and to make a neat 11 through
the misfortunes of its victims.
Il is a strange situation where students are trusted by
a barber and not bv the authorities of their own I niversitv.
