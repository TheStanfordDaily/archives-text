##

Of course, no one can say. lU;i if il is the irue stuff,
and uol mere ethereal haze that hangs so promisingly on
the horizon of Stanford, il will he a better Farm, and that
before long.
On its last undergraduate lges, the Class of \'W looks
back Dii four crucial years in the life of a great University.
II sees a tiuancial crash that showed no partiality. II sees
a decision between gradual elimination and fortification
of I lie lower division. Il sees a decision between admitting
more women or lowering standards for men.
And on the very threshold of whatever is out there, it
notes with satisfaction one of the last constructive steps
during its four undergraduate days. Tonight President
Wilbur will act as host to numerous students. Il is the first
step in closing the gap between administration and under
graduates. May i1 be a sign of a better Farm.
