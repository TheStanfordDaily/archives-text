### ABE MELLINKOFF 
LUMP IN THROAT A
i The beginning and the end of any- '
J thing is usually quite formidable.
I There seems to be an obligation to
• make a fuss. Pick up the average
1 textbook and read the first and last
paragraphs—whatever be the book,
the structure is sure to be redun
dant and the sentences will abound
1 in surplus adjectives. When we
; meet a person and when we say
good-bye, our larynx draws deeply
! and pours forth blarney and pa
t laver.

This is my last Bull Session. It
i is altogether fitting and proper that
J I should grow mellow and senti
; mental — thinking of all that has
j gone before in this space. Day after
i day for quarter upon quarter, a
little brain child has sprung naked
j and ill - formed upon the printed {
! page. Each one had the author's 1
| love and affection—equal and un
i dying, until the next day.
I When I even stop to think of the
| vast horde that I have produced, my
| number-phobia wells up within me.
I would love some statistician to fig
ure out that if all the words in
these articles were laid end to end :
they would reach from Stanford to
the World's Fair and back via the ,
Grand Canyon. This would be a
fancy bit of knowledge to have at i
one's finger tips. It would be some
thing startling to know. Something ,
to pass off when the conversation
| grew slack. Just one of those state
j ments that: start people asking: "You
I don't say?" "Can that be so?"
There have been some very en- |

kNI) MIST OVER EYE
' joyablc elements in writing this col
umn every day. One of the most
! fascinating were the anonymous
letters; some complimentary and 1
some very vice versa. I never have
been able to figure out the com
plex'that produces an anonymous
letter. And especially anonymous
poetry —in a feminine hand. And
still more especially three poems in
the same feminine hand. By the
hour I sit in the sunlight and won
der who she is.
I
One of the not so enjoyable results I
is the people who interpret every i
i article as dictated by malice afore
thought, economic advancement, not 1
to mention inborn hate, and a per
verted desire to wreak havoc gen
erally. Never shall I forget one
j bleak October day when I boosted
Mars to the sky: I was waiting with
apprehension for a protesting let
ter from Venus and Jupiter. I am
, told that the letters were later lost
in the Christmas rush.
The Bull Session column, as such,
| is an orphan child adopted and re
j adopted by successive .students. A
' man comes along and picks up the
i struggling orphan, gives it a home,
, and love and a mother's care for a
while. Then, it is turned out in the
i cold again. For some time, dear
Bull Session, have I, watched over |
; and protected you from the ravages
of time and copy-readers. Now, I j
boot you out into the streets. May |
; the elements be kind to you. What [
I is your future, I do not know. And
| neither do you.
