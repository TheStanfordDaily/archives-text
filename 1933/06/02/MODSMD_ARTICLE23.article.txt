The Editor, Sir:
Apropos of your editorial on.
"What Will the Commencement
Orator Manage to Say This June,"
you will be interested to note that
the San Mateo Junior College Com
mencement orator a few days ago
took for his theme: "Graduationâ€”
For Unemployment."
Up to a few months ago only 25
of the 490 Harvard graduates of the
class of 1932 had succeeded in ob
taining permanent employment!
Similar figures are reported for
other colleges and universities. What
else is to be expected? The pros
pective graduates are faced not only
by a vastly decreased number of
available jobs but by a vastly in
creased number of applicants fi'om
among the seasoned graduates of
other years.
From 35 to 45 per cent of all the
chemists in the countiy are unem
ployed. Sixteen per. cent of the
lawyers in New York City who were
graduated since 1925 have aban
doned their practice and gone look
ing for "jobs." Seventeen per cent
of all the graduate engineers in the

country were reported unemployed
as early as 1931. No wonder 62 per
cent of that year's engineering grad
uates had not found any employ
ment by the end of the year. As to
teachers, the past overproduction
throughout the country has been
such that it is authoritatively esti
mated that it will be five years AF
TER THE END OF THE DEPRES
SION before the demand will any
where near approximate the mount
ing supply.
The National Planning Committee
for Unemployed College Graduates
estimates that one out of eight mem
bers of this year's graduating classes
stands a chance of obtaining self
supporting employment within any
period of time near enough to be
worth while planning for. Th? Com
mittee therefore is not devoting it
self to the futile task of seeking out
paying jobs for college graduates,
but to a constructive effort to or
ganize college men for public serv
ice, whether or not such service pays
anything in immediate personal re
turns.
There is, of course, no one solu

tion to that Committee's problem.
| Assuming that unemployed college
men and women will manage to stay
alive somehow, with or without a
regular income, their opportunities
to participate in constructive public
service and at the same time to
promote their educational, cultural,
and recreational interests are as
wide and varied as the political, so
-1 cial, and economic derangements
that have followed in the wake of
our economic debacle.
Thr ;e types of such opportunities,
however, do stand out as pre-emi
nently appropriate for college men
and women of gumption, vision,
and slick-to-it-iveness:
(1) Quid-pro-quo work in self
helping organizations of the unem
ployed, in co-operative associations
j of consumers, in mutual aid asso
ciations for the barter of goods and
services, etc.;
i
(2) Apprentice work in such gov
ernmental services as city planning,
public health, employment bureaus,
recreational centers, etc.; and
(3) Volunteer work with chari
i table, philanthropic, and social serv
ice organizations; or with civic
agencies, political organizations, and
social reform associations.
In one or another of these types of
' much needed but inadequately fi
nanced economic, civic, social, and
political activities, any college man
i or woman, no matter what his or
her personal interests, professional
aspirations, or social or political
leanings, should certainly find his
need of opportunity for service and
spiritual and mental well being. In
somfc of them, indeed, he or she
even obtain a semblance of
| self-support.
Sincerely yours,
Harvey Lebrun
