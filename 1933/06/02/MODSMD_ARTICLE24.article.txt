### OLD DR. ALGAR 
A sea captain wrecked on an isle
When his compass proved just a
tin dial
He lives in the trees
In his pink B.V.D.'s
And his clothes never get out
of style.

A hungry cow
Eats grass and weeds
And wildflowers calmly munches.
I'm glad that I
Am not a plant
That grows on hills in bunches.
