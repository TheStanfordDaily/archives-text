Ah, romance. The romance of i
pounding, whirring presses singing
their Song of the Dirt to a nation.
Of coatless, furrow-browed report
ers scowling over typewriters. Of
wires humming joyfully with mur
ders and thefts.
The romance of a newspaper.
Of writing a column day after
day. Of being the jestful sport
and the angry gripe of all ex
cept a roommate or two.
j Romance, never again to be mine.
Once I built a column, made them
print it, sometimes got it in on time.
Once I built a column, now Spud
Hamilton will rebuild it.
Buddy, can you spare a job?
Ah, power. The grinding, churn-
I ing power of an angry locomotive.
I The muscular, big-jawed power of
: Mussolini. The swelling, blathering,
j vociferous power of a minute Sports
i Editoi:.
The shouting power of "Do as I
| bid." And the blind, impotent power
i of believing it done.
Power. The friendly, satisfactory
; power of having a guy like Spud
1 Hamilton to help get it done.
The powerful thrill of reading will
I Bungay's stories and knowing, with-
I out qualm or doubt, that all the
facts are correct. The glowing pride
at watching Chuck Chappell from an
adjectiveless freshman to a concise,
I clear writer. The satisfactory, hearty
! power of giving Jack Drown an as
: signment and his smiling assent
Yes, power. The lucky power
of assigning A1 Gucrard a story

and (he generous envy of his |
polished, authoritative, adroit
yarns. The selfish conceit of lis
tening to Ollic Johnston's re
quests for advice, and his sub
sequent utilization of that ad
vice to improve liis writing. The
boisterous attempts of Julius
Jacobs to popularize interclass
tennis by writing up the Mys
tery Woman.
The power of Frank Tremaine's
expert baseball stories, and the
plca.sureable power of listening to
John Kline's moans before insisting
that he cover a frosh ti'ack meet.
The opportune power of hearing
Eiil Conlin's red-headed chuckle.
Finally, satisfaction. The calm,
sunny satisfaction of a calm, sunny
afternoon. The expanding, belt
breaking satisfaction of a Thanks
giving dinner. The relaxed, cool,
starchy-white satisfaction of a Pull
man berth, green curtains outside,
and a tired man within.
Yes, satisfaction. The com
pensating satisfaction of know
ing that my mistakes will not be
blatantly repeated. The expect
ant satisfaction that will be de
rived from reading Slants next
year. The complete, grateful, .
shouted satisfaction with my
successor—Spud Hamilton.
That's all there is. There isn't any i
more. —Dick Strouse
