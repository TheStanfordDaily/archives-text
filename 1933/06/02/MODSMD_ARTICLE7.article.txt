# Old Boy Postcards Joe Thompson In Chaparral
## 
### Algarstern 
Well, Joe, since your monthly let- |
ter sorta stopped on us last issue ;
and since I feel you would be in- >
terested in a lotta things that you
are going on here on the Farm, I'm
taking this means to tell you about j
the local layout and about the June
issue of the Chaparral.
Honestly, boy, the administra
tion played right into the old cof
fin when it decided to let down
the bars and swamp the place
with women. Imagine, Joe! What
a theme for an issue. Women!
Ha, boy! Sex! Well, we snapped
it tip and you oughta see the
bouquets (Stanford variety) we
hand the ga-ga femmes.
First we sorta put the skids under

| a couple of the leading sisterhoods, :
and I'm told Speedball is gunning '
for yours truly.
! Also, if you're wondering what j
this institution is going to look like !
| next registration day . . . well,
j women, women everywhere and not
a drop to drink. (Or so say the
"no beer on the campus" stories.)
But that's beside the point. The |
' decimal point. Yessir. Gold done j
it. Filthy lucre. Take a look at the 1
June cover and my point will need j
no further hallucination.
The June issue finishes up the
year, Joe, and it equals that other
"what is so rare" item that some- |
body attributed to June. It's a
pip. if I do say so myself, and
you ought to see it!
