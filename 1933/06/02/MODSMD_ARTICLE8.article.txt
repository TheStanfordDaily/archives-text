## A 						Final Indictment 
### 
You can play with fire for a year and never get
burned,' hut you can't sit down in it. . . . That's what
the members of the present Executive Committee realize
this morning as they read the final edition of Volume 83
of the official news organ of their A.S.S.U. All unknown
to the rank and file of the student voters who put them
there, the members of the Ex Committee have committed
blunders pretty consistently this year. Those blunders
have remained unknown to the campus at large through
an attitude of mind on the Daily. This volume and its
predecessor has felt that the holding up to ridicule of
certain Ex Committee actions might prejudice an other
wise uninformed and impassive student body against
whatever constructive ideas the committee might have
conceived during the year.
But the end of every rope is reached eventually. The
Daily was able to stand aloofly above the carcasses of
other worthy enterprises slain at the Ex Committee's
hand, and to remain tactfully silent. But the Daily can
not find it within its essentially human make-up to stand
quietly above its own carcass. The Daily cannot, this
morning, remain mute concerning the Ex Committee
action which resulted in the installation of Abe Mellin
koff rather than Don Douglass as the next editor.
First of all, the Dajly at first refused to place any
credence in the possibility of the Ex Committee's pre
suming to consider itself a better judge of the qualifica
tions of any group of candidates for the editorship than
the Publications Council. The Daily was wrong—naively
so—forgetting for the moment the disastrous effects
which resulted when the committee had presumed to
run the Dramatic Council's affairs.
In making its decision the Ex Committee was swayed
by the assertion of Mellinkoff that he, if appointed,
would put a stop to that part of elective procedure
which is inevitable, "politics." And assuming that Mel
linkoff's words were worth their weight in gold, they
could not vouchsafe the future of the Daily for longer
than the four short months of his editorial term. For
briefness' sake, a summary will best express the Daily's
principal condemnation of an incompetent committee.
1. The present editor, ex-oft'icio member of the Ex
Committee, and one of the persons maligned by Mellin
koff's charges, was not notified of the meeting at which
the issue was decided. Further, had been officially in
formed that the business would be concluded twenty
four hours later.
2. None of the persons likewise maligned by Mellin
koff's witnesses were given an opportunity to refute
those charges.
3. The constitutional authority under which the com
mittee acted was never intended Jo be used in a manda
tory sense.
4. The Ex Committee's professed intention to remedy
a faulty election system was acted upon last night, after
they had seen the campus objection to the arbitrary ap
pointment of Mellinkoff. If, as the committee states, the
system is faulty, then its action in denying Douglass the
editorship was retroactive.
5. The committee gave a trusting ear to perjured evi
dence at its farcical "investigation."
6. THE EX COMMITTEE CLEARLY IMPLIED
BY ITS ATTITUDE LAST NIGHT THAT IT
WOULD RELIGIOUSLY BLOCK ANY ATTEMPT
BY 400 PETITIONING STUDENTS TO SECURE
FURTHER CONSIDERATION.
