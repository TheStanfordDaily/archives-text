# A 						Former Editor Speaks
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Yesterday morning I read in the
paper that Abe MellinkofT had
been appointed editor of the Daily
by (lie Executive Committee. Na
turally I was surprised, and a little
pu/./.lcd, because I have always
thought that Daily editors were
elected by the staff, and then, if
none of the candidates got a two
thirds majority, the best man was
selected by Publications Council,
an impartial body which probably
knows more about the newspaper
game than any other single stu
dent group on the Coast.
A fellow named Don Douglass had
won the staff election by 21 to 18
to 14. Those seven editors and man
agers on the Council had gathered
after the election and all agreed that
Douglass would make a better editor
than MellinkofT. It was probably the
first time in history that they had
decided unanimously on one man.
But. my surprise at; that was
nothing compared to what I thought
about the two major reasons why
the Executive Committee had re
fused this decision and appointed
Mcllinkoff. One of them was that a
former Daily editor had been at the
polls during the election, and had
been an influence on the voters.
It so happens that I am that for
mer editor, and I don't like people
to say things about me that are un
true and use those things as reasons
fot such unpleasant acts as taking
the editorship away from a man
who has earned it fairly and square
ly and unanimously, and give it to
another man who is a good man and
a fine writer, but is generally con
sidered to be not quite so deserving
or well qualified to be editor, since

he has never done anything on the
Daily but write his column.
Another thing I didn't like was
that Abe Mcllinkoff, the defeated
candidate, happened to be the one
who told the Executive Committee
that Iliad been an influence on
voters at the polls.
In case you are interested, the
truth is that Milo Tally, the A.S.S.U.
election board man, had wanted me
to I*; at the polls to identify the
men who came in to vote ~since he
did not know them. Incidentally he
is pretty mad that the Executive
Committee did not see him before
making that charge against me.
Another charge they made is that
I should not have voted in the elec
tion. I am totally at a loss, and so
is everybody else on the Daily it
seems, except the defeated candi
date, as to why I should not have
voted. I have been on the staff every
clay since 1929, and I can't see why
the fact, that I was once an editor
should disqualify me. Mcllinkoff
voted. He is no more a member of
the staff than I, and he Is a graduate,
while I am only a senior.
If it weren't that I feel so sorry
for Don Douglass, recognized as a
brilliant writer and a brilliant news
paperman who has worked from a
freshman reporter light up through
the ranlis and has been outstanding
all the way, I would think that this
whole business is very humorous.
For instance, when William
Corbus, student body president,
said that lie thought Mcllinkoff
would make the better editor of
the two. Then when lie was asked
if be knew Douglass he said no.
that lie had never met him.
Sincerely yours,
Stewart Crawford

It so happens that I am that for
mer editor, and I don't like people
to say things about me that are un
true and use those things as reasons
fot such unpleasant acts as taking
the editorship away from a man
who has earned it fairly and square
ly and unanimously, and give it to
another man who is a good man and
a fine writer, but is generally con
sidered to be not quite so deserving
or well qualified to be editor, since

he has never done anything on the
Daily but write his column.
Another thing I didn't like was
that Abe Mcllinkoff, the defeated
candidate, happened to be the one
who told the Executive Committee
that Iliad been an influence on
voters at the polls.
In case you are interested, the
truth is that Milo Tally, the A.S.S.U.
election board man, had wanted me
to I*; at the polls to identify the
men who came in to vote ~since he
did not know them. Incidentally he
is pretty mad that the Executive
Committee did not see him before
making that charge against me.
Another charge they made is that
I should not have voted in the elec
tion. I am totally at a loss, and so
is everybody else on the Daily it
seems, except the defeated candi
date, as to why I should not have
voted. I have been on the staff every
clay since 1929, and I can't see why
the fact, that I was once an editor
should disqualify me. Mcllinkoff
voted. He is no more a member of
the staff than I, and he Is a graduate,
while I am only a senior.
If it weren't that I feel so sorry
for Don Douglass, recognized as a
brilliant writer and a brilliant news
paperman who has worked from a
freshman reporter light up through
the ranlis and has been outstanding
all the way, I would think that this
whole business is very humorous.
For instance, when William
Corbus, student body president,
said that lie thought Mcllinkoff
would make the better editor of
the two. Then when lie was asked
if be knew Douglass he said no.
that lie had never met him.

The Editor, Sir:
Yesterday morning I read in the
paper that Abe MellinkofT had
been appointed editor of the Daily
by (lie Executive Committee. Na
turally I was surprised, and a little
pu/./.lcd, because I have always
thought that Daily editors were
elected by the staff, and then, if
none of the candidates got a two
thirds majority, the best man was
selected by Publications Council,
an impartial body which probably
knows more about the newspaper
game than any other single stu
dent group on the Coast.
A fellow named Don Douglass had
won the staff election by 21 to 18
to 14. Those seven editors and man
agers on the Council had gathered
after the election and all agreed that
Douglass would make a better editor
than MellinkofT. It was probably the
first time in history that they had
decided unanimously on one man.
But. my surprise at; that was
nothing compared to what I thought
about the two major reasons why
the Executive Committee had re
fused this decision and appointed
Mcllinkoff. One of them was that a
former Daily editor had been at the
polls during the election, and had
been an influence on the voters.
It so happens that I am that for
mer editor, and I don't like people
to say things about me that are un
true and use those things as reasons
fot such unpleasant acts as taking
