"The Union will continue to be the
usual convenient center of student life,"
Miss Christine Ricker, director of the
Union, says. "The lobby and the Union
court offer a pleasant place to sit and
talk or study, and we hope that they
will be taken advantage of and that
summer quarter students will make
use of them as a general meeting place.
"The fact that the upper floors of
the main Union building are being used
as a dormitory for women makes ab
solutely no change in the eating fa
cilities of the Union. Possibly it will
help to make the Union even more of
a social center of student life."

from 7:30 in the morning to 10:30 in
the evening, and will offer a regular
fountain and coffee shop service, while
candy, tobacco, and drugs may be pur
chased at the cigar counter there.
