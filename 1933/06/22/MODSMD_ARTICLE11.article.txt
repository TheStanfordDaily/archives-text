# President Wilbur Offers Summer Students Greeting
## 
### 
The summer time is in many ways
the best time on the Stanford campus.
Most of the days are ideal for study
or recreation, the group of students is
small enough so that there is unusu
ally good opportunity for acquaintance
ship between faculty and students, and
there are fewer diversions than during
other parts of the year. Because of
this, many of our students look back
on their summer work here with un
usual satisfaction.

The welcome we extend to those who
come to Stanford for the first time dur
ing the present summer quarter is a
very hearty one. One of the objects
of the summer quarter is to make it
possible for those who cannot attend
at any other session of the year to be
come acquainted with our faculty and
our libraries and other facilities. We
hope that all of the students will take
advantage of the public lectures and
various social opportunities. Director
Eliot Grinnell Mears stands ready to
be helpful in any possible way.
One of the unique advantages of
summer attendance at Stanford is that
you will have to do your own exercise,
instead of watching somebody else do
it for you. Intercollegiate athletics go
into "innocuous desuetude" along with
winter clothes; but the swimming pools,
the tennis courts, and the other facili
ties of the gymnasiums are available,
and we hope that they will be used
regularly and by all.
We want you to treasure your Stan
ford experience as so many of us do.
What it will be, you yourself largely
determine.
