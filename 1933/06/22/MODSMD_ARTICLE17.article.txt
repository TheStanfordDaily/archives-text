# EDUCATION AND RECREATION
## 
### 
The summer quarter is a most favorable season in which to get a
little real education.
Information ladled out, spoonful by spoonful, and carefully handed
back in class exercises and examinations will earn grades and even de
grees, but it doesn't insure education. Such is available at Stanford, but
it isn't compulsory, and the student is encouraged to go deeper and
farther.
Not all the opportunities for real education at Stanford this summer
are to be found in the credit courses. Those who ignore the lectures and
programs on the campus or nearby, as the Hillsboro Symphony, with its
special student rate, for example, are missing educational opportunities.
Professor Clark's series on history and appreciation of art, beginning
this evening, is the skimmed cream of a course which he used to give over
a quarter. With the knowledge of art provided by Professor Clark's six
illustrated talks, one will have a basis for going on to deeper understand
ing and enjoyment of artistic creation —genuine culture as distinguished
from amassed information. This is true of other lectures in various fields.
Then too, summer is the normal period for physical recreation. Mind
works more effectively if body is in trim. Opportunities are offered for
toning up circulation and nerves —walking in the hills, swimming, tennis,
golf.
There are a lot of fine people in student body and faculty, people
whose friendship is worth having. The social hermit misses much. The
campus is a favored spot for establishing enduring friendships.
