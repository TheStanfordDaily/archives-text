# THE 						WILBURS' AT HOME
## 
### 
A generation has just left Stanford which had a chance to meet Presi
dent and Mrs. Wilbur only a few times. They felt the loss keenly.
Tomorrow evening this quarter's student body, at the very outset of
the term, is provided with the opportunity that was so seldom enjoyed
by recent graduates.
It is a pleasant thing to meet the President of the University and his
wife on the friendly and informal basis that they provide in their home,
and the evening further offers a first occasion for students to become
acquainted with each other.
