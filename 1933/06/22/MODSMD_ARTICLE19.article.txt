# UNION A SOCIAL CENTER

### 
The Stanford Union is the center of student life, a meeting place.
This summer it may become even more so, since the upper floors will be
used as a women's dormitory. Wholly aside from "dates," the Union
lobby and its court remain the most convenient and pleasantest spot for
just sitting around and talking.
It is welcome news that, despite a decreased student body this sum
mer, all facilities for "eats" that the Union affords in other seasons will
remain in full operation. The Cellar offers a most acceptable informal
meeting place. The Cafeteria and Dining Room are conveniences not
always fully appreciated until they are closed.
