# THIS PAPER'S PURPOSE
## 
### 
The purpose of this paradoxically named newspaper is to keep Stan
ford students and faculty informed of what is going on hereabouts. The
management is not responsible for calling a paper that comes out twice
a week "The Stanford Daily." The official name is "Daily." Summer
quarter finances will not support publication oftener than twice a week.
On Tuesdays and Thursdays, then, the "Daily" will present accounts
of what has happened and give notice of events that are to take place.
The "Daily" hopes, also, to serve as a centralizing influence for the
Student Body in a quarter when the "activities" of other quarters are
greatly reduced.
In this connection the "Daily" offers its columns for the diffusion of
ideas of its readers. It welcomes letters for publication. Names of writers
must be known although, on request, they need not be printed. Space is
obviously at a premium; consequently communications must be brief.
The editors suggest that the "Daily" will serve excellently as a sup
plement if not a substitute for letters home. For one dollar, payable to
the business manager, a twice-a-week budget of campus news can be
delivered at any distance.
