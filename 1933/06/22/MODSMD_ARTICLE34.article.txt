# Chinese Scholar to Preach In Memorial Church Sunday
## 
### 
Dr. Y. Y. Tsu, the Chinese scholar
and religious leader, who has been
heard at Stanford before, will be the
preacher in the Memorial Church next
Sunday morning.
A student in Chinese and American
schools and a teacher of philosophy and
sociology in both countries, Dr. Tsu is
social and religious director of the
Peking Union Medical College.
Himself a Christian, he is thoroughly
conversant with the great Oriental re
ligions, on which he gave a series of
lectures here last autumn.
