# Director Mears Welcomes All To Stanford Freedom
## 
### 
Stanford University extends a sin
cere welcome to all summer quarter
students. The academic portals are
swung wide, with our classrooms, lab
oratories, and libraries awaiting you.
We hope, too, that you will make use
of the unique opportunities here for
recreation —surely, swimming, tennis,
golf, the gymnasium, and hiking afford
sufficient variety for everyone. A resi
dential campus of over seven thousand

acres of alluring foothills and valleys
provides a living community.
Stanford's motto is "Die Luft der
Freheit weht" ("Let the winds of free
dom blow"). Newcomers will find here
the minimum of offcial rules and reg
ulations, and student traditions.
Those of you who are already acquaint
ed with life on the Farm can demon
strate the true Stanford spirit by mak
ing the new students feel at home.
Just a further bit of information. Do
not overlook the rich treat presented
by the various series of public exer
cises during the coming ten and a half
weeks. Every Tuesday evening there
will be prsented varied attractions of
general interest. On Wednesday after
noons there will be lectures by visiting
professors upon subjects in which they
are exceptionally well versed to speak
with authority. Organ recitals will be
held on Thursday afternoons and Sun
day evenings. On Thursday evenings
throughout the quarter there will be il
lustrated lectures dealing with paint
ing, sculpture, and music. In addition
to these different series, other interest
ing and worthwhile entertainments will
be announced in the current issues of
the University Calendar (weekly) and
the Stanford Daily (appearing semi
weekly).
A summer on the Stanford campus
should prove to be satisfying to each
one of you—at least, that is my per
sonal hope and belief.
ELIOT G. MEARS.
