# Building Rooms For War Library
## 
### 
Extensive alterations and additions
are being made in the book stacks wing
of the library building to provide ade
quate working space for the research
workers and staff of the Hoover War
Library, especially in the archives di
vision of that collection.
These original records, one of the
most valuable parts of the war library
since they are largely not to be dupli
cated elsewhere, will be brought into
one on a floor at the sixth stack
level now being constructed at the east
ern end of the wing, and offices and
work rooms will be built on two sides
of the wing, which have windows.
One of these offices will be at the
disposal of Herbert Hoover, organizer
of the library, who is expected to de
vote considerable time to directing re
search work and editing portions of the
records for publication.
The archives, which are now scat
tered, some still in storage, will be
placed in fire-proof cases and since the
library is itself fire-proof will thus be
safe from destruction as well as ac
cessible for scholarly studies.
The money for the construction work
is a gift to the University from a group
of men interested in the Hoover War
Library.
In other parts of the wing other
stacks will be erected, to accommodate
shifting of books on account of the con
centration of the archives material, but
the general library will gain only a
relatively small amount of additional
shelf space for the general collections.
There is still space for a seventh stack
level over the whole stack-room space,
before it becomes necessary to enlarge
that wing of the library, as was con
templated for some future time when
the library was planned.
