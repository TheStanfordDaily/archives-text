# Mexican Group To Give Unique Recital Tonight
## "Las Tapatias," Four Singing Sisters, Interpret Folk Music Program Starts At 8 Oâ€™Clock In Union Court 
### 
"Las Tapatias," four sisters from
Guadalajara, Mexico, will present "A
Night in Mexico" in the Stanford Union
Court this evening at 8 o'clock.
The sisters are Emilia Lindeman
Rathbun of Stanford University, and
Elena, Berta, and Clotilde Lindeman
of San Jose. These artists are of Span
ish and Mexican descent and were
born and raised in Mexico. They bring
to American audiences a unique pro
gram of authentic Mexican folk music.
Many of the songs they sing are their
own arrangements and will be entirely
new to California music-lovers.
They divide their program into
three groups. The first deals with the
Mestiza Indians from the peninsula of
Yucatan. These Indians live close to
nature and express their love for birds
and flowers in their dress and songs.
The second group of the "Las Tapa
tias" program is in the form of a Mar
ket scene, one of the most interesting
phases of Mexican folk life. The dress
es they wear are those of the Colima
Indians. They embroider colored cross
stitch designs on unbleached muslin
blouses and skirts of a straight, se
vere pattern. They pass the design on
for generations much as one might pass
on a song by word of mouth for they
carry the design in their minds and
know it so well that no guide is neces
sary to work out their elaborate bor
ders.
The last group of "A Night in Mex
ico" is a festive scene. The costumes of
"China Poblana" are in direct contrast
to the simplicity of those preceding.
"Las Tapatias" will be accompanied by
Pablo Fedelin, with his mandolin, and
Mariano Flores, guitarist.
There will be no admission charge.
