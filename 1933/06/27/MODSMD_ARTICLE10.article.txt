# SCHOOL CHILDREN MOVE INTO PHI KAP HOUSE; CLAMOR FOR SECONDS AND UPPER BERTHS
## 
### Eleanor Furst 
It's vacation time for the children of
Verna Jean school ,a private institu
tion in San Francisco for children be
l tween the ages of seven and twelve,
and for the third successive year
twenty-five youngsters have moved
! into the Phi Kappa Sigma house on
Alvarado street.
Scooters and jump ropes have taken
the place of baseball and football on
the Phi Kapf front lawn, while inside
picture puzzles and building blocks are
strewn in place of textbooks on the
; study table. Except for their ages, these
youngsters are not so different, how
ever, from the regular occupants of
the house, for the nurses tell us it's

almost impossible to keep enough bread
I and butter and refils on the table, while
the usual amount of scrapping goes on
over who gets the upper bunk.
Sheila, a bright-eyed lass of six, in
terrupts the task of seating her black
and white terrier in Jimmy's cart —be-
cause he's sick and the ambulance is
| going to take him to the hospital over
there on the woodpile—long enough to
say that she likes it down here better
than in the city because there's no
school and lots of nice things to do,
such as marshmallow toasts around the
fire, games, and swimming. Twenty
| more children will join the group al
ready here when school lets out for
everybody on July 1.
