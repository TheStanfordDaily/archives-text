# Berlin Maestro Scores Hillsborough Success
## 
### 
With Richard Lert of Berlin and Los
Angeles as guest conductor, and Gun
nar Johansen ,young San Franciscan
pianist, as soloist, the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra gave the first of
the summer series of concerts in the
Hillsborough woodland Theatre Sun
day to a capacity crowd of enthusiastic
listeners.
The two final numbers, a suite from
"Der Rosenkavalier" of Richard Strauss
and Johann Strauss' "Tales from the
Vienna Woods," were particularly well
received.
Lert's highly restrained interpreta
tion was striking in his unusual read
ing of Wagner's "Tannhauser" over
ture, the extreme intimacy of his softer
passages lending greater dignity and
majesty to his climaxes. Without once
calling for the orchestra's full volume
he was able by contrast with the whis
pered lyric movements to produce tre
mendous power in the forte bars.
He again took noticeable liberties
with the scores of Nicolai's "Merry
Wives of Windsor" overture and Heu
berger's "Nachtmusik." The second, a
piece practically unknown to Ameri
can audiences, was for strings alone,
and was exquisitely suited to the deli
cacy of the conductor.
Johansen's playing of the Brahms B
flat major piano concerto was most
enjoyable in the final movement. The
lighter, perhaps more sensuous, nature
of the concerto's closing measures was
well adapted to the artist's tempera
ment and technic.
