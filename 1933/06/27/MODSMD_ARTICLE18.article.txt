# STANFORD TRADITIONS
## 
### 
| ,
Traditions, unwritten rules of conduct, are few at Stanford. These ;
few are fairly carefully observed during the autumn, winter, and spring i
quarters. Summer quarter residents, eager to be gathered into the Stan
ford family, can do so in no easier way than by observing the none-too
stringent rules of the Stanford Farm.
First, say "Hello!" to everyone you meet, male or female, whether
you know that individual or not. This is the grandest of Stanford tradi
tions. If someone passes you on the familiar walk to the Postoffice
without sparing a smile and "Hello!" that glum individual is not a
Stanford student, his $114 notwithstanding.
The "Hello spirit" is the backbone of the Farm, welding unbreakable
bonds of friendship. It is the "Hello" spirit" that gives you a glow of
pride when you see a Stanford sticker in Nome, Buenos Aires, Cape
Town, or Bombay. It makes you seek out the owner of the sticker and
have dinner with him, even though he may be in the Class of '98 while
you completed your 180 units 25 years later. After dinner you'll almost
certainly drink a toast to the Farm and to the "Hello spirit" you learned
there.
"Don't smoke on the Quad!" This is the second cardinal tradition.
There is one good reason why this rule should never be broken: Mrs.
Stanford made the request more than 35 years ago, and it has been
respected ever since.
When your mind is clouded by treaties, hypotheses, translations, and
too little foresight on the night before, a cigarette is often the very thing
for you—but not under the arcades, in the hallways, or elsewhere on the
Quad. The lawns and sidewalks outside invite summer quarter smokers
just as they have invited countless others in the past.
There is one very indefinite tradition, since it determines mental atti
tude rather than a series of hard-and-fast "Don'ts," that is extremely
valuable ....
A Stanford student avoids being collegiate!
Studying and having a good time are the chief aims of a Farm resi
dent, and he does not consider making himself obvious an aid in fulfilling
them. Whooping it up at the discomfort of others is not a Stanfordite's
idea of a good time.
For this reason, disturbances in Palo Alto and San Francisco are not
indulged in to any great extent. If you don't like a moving picture, get
up quietly and leave the theatre, don't boo and throw things.
There are several other traditions at Stanford which are less im
portant, but while they last should be observed. Underclassmen do not
wear cords; women and freshmen do not walk down the Law Steps;
students applaud their professors at the conclusion of every course ....
But the ones to think about are the first three. If you observe them
carefully, you'll make many friends, and the whole worth of your summer j
at Stanford will be greatly enhanced.
In reference to actions off-campus, there is one paramount rule. If
you are driving a car, pick up anyone going from Palo Alto to the cam
pus. This is one tradition seldom disregarded.

you are driving a car, pick up anyone going from Palo Alto to the cam
pus. This is one tradition seldom disregarded.

Traditions, unwritten rules of conduct, are few at Stanford. These ;
few are fairly carefully observed during the autumn, winter, and spring i
quarters. Summer quarter residents, eager to be gathered into the Stan
ford family, can do so in no easier way than by observing the none-too
stringent rules of the Stanford Farm.
First, say "Hello!" to everyone you meet, male or female, whether
you know that individual or not. This is the grandest of Stanford tradi
tions. If someone passes you on the familiar walk to the Postoffice
without sparing a smile and "Hello!" that glum individual is not a
Stanford student, his $114 notwithstanding.
The "Hello spirit" is the backbone of the Farm, welding unbreakable
bonds of friendship. It is the "Hello" spirit" that gives you a glow of
pride when you see a Stanford sticker in Nome, Buenos Aires, Cape
Town, or Bombay. It makes you seek out the owner of the sticker and
have dinner with him, even though he may be in the Class of '98 while
you completed your 180 units 25 years later. After dinner you'll almost
certainly drink a toast to the Farm and to the "Hello spirit" you learned
there.
"Don't smoke on the Quad!" This is the second cardinal tradition.
There is one good reason why this rule should never be broken: Mrs.
Stanford made the request more than 35 years ago, and it has been
respected ever since.
When your mind is clouded by treaties, hypotheses, translations, and
too little foresight on the night before, a cigarette is often the very thing
for you—but not under the arcades, in the hallways, or elsewhere on the
Quad. The lawns and sidewalks outside invite summer quarter smokers
just as they have invited countless others in the past.
There is one very indefinite tradition, since it determines mental atti
tude rather than a series of hard-and-fast "Don'ts," that is extremely
valuable ....
A Stanford student avoids being collegiate!
Studying and having a good time are the chief aims of a Farm resi
dent, and he does not consider making himself obvious an aid in fulfilling
them. Whooping it up at the discomfort of others is not a Stanfordite's
idea of a good time.
For this reason, disturbances in Palo Alto and San Francisco are not
indulged in to any great extent. If you don't like a moving picture, get
up quietly and leave the theatre, don't boo and throw things.
There are several other traditions at Stanford which are less im
portant, but while they last should be observed. Underclassmen do not
wear cords; women and freshmen do not walk down the Law Steps;
students applaud their professors at the conclusion of every course ....
But the ones to think about are the first three. If you observe them
carefully, you'll make many friends, and the whole worth of your summer j
at Stanford will be greatly enhanced.
In reference to actions off-campus, there is one paramount rule. If
you are driving a car, pick up anyone going from Palo Alto to the cam
pus. This is one tradition seldom disregarded.
