# UNION JOLLY-UP
## 
### 
Nothing could give the still very young summer quarter a better start
toward a socially successful middle age and senility than a Union jolly-up
within the next week. Vague rumors emanating from the onetime strong
hold of the graduate student indicate that 45 women of varying size,
shape, and fortune reside therein. But the other 450 or so students are
still pretty much in the dark about the whole situation.
Two or three days of hard but pleasant work on the part of Union
women would suffice to weld that group into an efficient club (such as
the Roble Club of former days) which could sponsor a free-for-all jolly
up and get itself acquainted with the male portion of the student body.
Off-campus women who do not reside in the Union should of course be
invited to help give some significance to the phrase: "co-educational in
stitution."
Miss Ricker, director of the Union, has approved the idea, and an
nounced herself willing to contribute the use of the Union lobby or the
Women's Clubhouse for the dance. Roble jolly-ups have frequently been
held in the first two weeks of the autumn quarter, serving as a "coming
out" party for a new crop of Stanford women. May the Union follow
Roble's good example!
