# A 						YEARBOOK OF WRITING
## 
### 
The pensive muse, whether resident in ancient Greece or modern
Stanford, is made of flesh and blood, and any rumors to the contrary
may he safely denied. Said muse, therefore, is often in need of material
comfort and encouragement. At the Stanford Bookstore is a melancholy
]Â»ile of beautifully bound books entitled "A Yearbook of Stanford Writ
ing," containing the cream of the University's literary achievement for
the past academic year. These yearbooks, priced at one dollar, arc not
only significant as indications of modern literary trends among the
authors of tomorrow, but have much intrinsic merit. Such nationally
known writers as J. V. Cunningham, Don Stanford, and Barbara Gibbs,
who have published in numerous magazines, have contributed to the 1933
volume.
