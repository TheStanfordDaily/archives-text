# A. B. CLARK PRAISES ITALIAN ARTIST IN OPENING LECTURE
## Former Art Professor Lauds Giotto As Master Of Renaissance 
### 
"Art being largely emotionel, it is
what we feel when seeing a work of
art that determines our grasp of its
values," Professor A. B. Clark said in
his opening lecture on Art Apprecia
tion last Thursday evening at the Little
Theatre. A work of art which serves
merely to identify its object although
it possesses perfection of artistic struc
ture is seldom great.
A work to be truly great must pos
sess a quality of vitality and animated
action. Genius has the capacity of
"penetrative perception" while the ef
forts of the lesser artists and imitators
suffer from "plastic poverty."
Three Factors in Art
In judging a work, according to Pro
fessor Clark, there are three chief mo
tives to appreciate. These primary mo
tives are the thought or ideal ex
pressed, the technical representation of
objects presented and the design or ar
rangements of the entirety. Great art
ists think of all the motives at one
time.
Particular emphasis was given by
Professor Clark to the works of Giotto
whose revolutionary departure from
the methods of his predecessors estab
lished him as a source of inspiration
for coming centuries of artists. "He
was," Professor Clark said, "one of the
very greatest masters of the Renais
sance." He was most constantly excel
lent in his presentation of the thought
motive, but his efforts were also note
worthy for their rich detail and sym
metry of form.
Prehistoric Art Shown
Professor Clark illustrated his pre
liminary remarks on fundamentals with
slides of art works from prehistoric
drawings to recent modernistic works
and presented a large number of Giot
to's masterpieces, pointing out their
merits.
The second of his series of lectures
in which he is condensing his entire
course on Art Appreciation into six lec
tures, will be heard Thursday evening
in the Little Theatre.
