# DEAN OF BUSINESS SCHOOL ADDRESSES PALO ALTO CROWD
## 
### 
The repeal of the Eighteenth Amend
ment will not bring great gains in reve
nue and employment that Wets claim,
Professor J. Hugh Jackson, dean of the
Stanford Graduate School of Business,
declared to a capacity crowd at the
Palo Alto Community House Thursday
night.
Professor Jackson, who is the dry
delegate from this congressional dis
trict in today's election, spoke as a
business man and did not touch the
moral side of the question at all. He
discussed conditions after repeal from
four different anglesâ€”revenue, aid to
employment, effect on agricultural
prices, and the disregard for law it will
cause.
Statistics taken from the period be
fore the Eighteenth Amendment did
not approach the amount repealists
claimed it would.
Past employment figures show that
outside of the bartenders only 89,000
men were employed due to the liquor
industry. Professor Jackson feels that
unless the Wets intend to bring back
the saloon in all its former glory and
re-establish the bartender there will
be small gain in employment.
The amount of grain except barley
used in brewing and distilling liquor
is so small that the effect on agricul
tural prices will be very slight.
"A vote for repeal is a vote for an
increase in crime," said Professor Jack
son. Accidents and drunken driving
have increased greatly in the southern
part of the state since the return of
beer and the rpeal of the Wright Act.
