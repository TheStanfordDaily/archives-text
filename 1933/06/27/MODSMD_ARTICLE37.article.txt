# STANFORD MOURNS PASSING OF EARLY FACULTY MEMBER
## 
### 
Melville Best Anderson ,head of the
English department of the University
from the opening of Stanford until his
retirement in 1910, died last Thursday
in his eighty-third year from a heart
attack.
Dr. Anderson withdrew from teach
ing before he reached the regular re
toring age of 65 in order to devote his
whole time to his translation of Dante's
"Divine Comery." This he performed
in scholarly and difficult form, trans
posing the original Italian triple rhyme
into English verse and perfecting a
line-for-line translation. He had al
ready worked for years on this work
before his retirement, and had recently
completed it to his final satisfaction, in
a fifth edition, published in three vol
umes by the Oxford University Press.
The first edition was published in 1921,
and Dr. Anderson had revised the work
extensively for succeeding editions,
striving to make Dante's masterpiece
"an English poem," available at a rea
sonable price to all English readers.
Beginning in their undergraduate
days at Cornell University, when that
institution was young, Dr. Anderson
and Dr. David Starr Jordan were life
long friends. They were later teachers
together before Stanford was founded
and President Jordan made him one of
his first faculty here. In 1881, Dr. An
derson was a member of Dr. Jordan's
party in the epic ascent of the Matter
horn.
A student of modern languages and
literatures, Dr. Anderson taught these
subjects in various colleges, and was
also publisher of a considerable num
ber of translations from the French. He
was author of two volumes of poems,
one, "The Happy Teacher," signalizing
his retix-ement from Stanford, and the
other, "The Great Refusal," a war
poem, in 1916.
Carrying on studies in American
colleges and abroad at the University
of Paris and the University of Goet
tingen, Dr. Anderson was the recipient
of honorary degrees also from the Uni
versity of Aberdeen, the University of
Padua, and Mills College.
He is survived by his brother, Pro
fessor Edward Playfair Anderson, with
whom he has lived recently at La Jolla,
where he died, and by his son, Robert
Van Vleck Anderson, '06, an interna
tionally known geologist, now in Al
giers.
