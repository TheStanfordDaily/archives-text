# Tsu, Chinese Scholar, Talks On Companionship
## 
### 
Religion was presented as a form of
companionship by Dr. Y. Y. Tsu, the
Chinese scholar, in his Memorial
Church sermon Sunday.
Religion is companionship, Dr. Tsu
declared, and companionship is vital
to any true religion. The Chi'istian re
ligion, he said, includes the companion
ship of friends, that found in the books
of great authors, in the acquaintance,
through reading, with great individu
als, in the contact with nature, which
offers escape from the crowds of the
city to the country and the hills, and,
pre-eminently, in communion with
God.
