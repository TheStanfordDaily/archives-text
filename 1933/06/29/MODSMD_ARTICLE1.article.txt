# Union Women Will Sponser Dance, July 6
## Club Organization Formed; Stags Will Pay Ten Cents Each "Daily" Suggestion Followed By Hall Residents 
### 
There will be a jolly-up in the Union
Thursday evening, July 6.
The women of the Union, taking ad
vantage of the first opportunity since
the suggestion was made in the Daily,
made this decision at a meeting at
which they organized a Union club
last evening. They announced that stags
will be charged ten cents to help de
fray the cost of the orchestra.
Officers of the organization to man
age women's affairs during the summer
were elected at the meeting as follows,
in addition to Justine Jankowsky, who
had already been named president of
the A.W.S. for the summer: Dorothy
Wheaton, secretary-treasurer of the
A.W.S.; Aurabella Carter, chairman of
the committee on teas; Josephine Fil
cher and Dorothy Wheton, social com
mittee.
In determining to hold the jolly-up
next Friday the women requested that
the men, especially those in Toyon,
plan a similar organization so that they
might jointly promote such activities
as dances, picnics, and off-campus
trips. Many of these would otherwise
be prohibited because of the expense,
since there are only 46 women in the
Union. Through such co-operation the
two organizations might plan a dance,
for which there have been several re
quests.
Aurabella Carter announced that
there will be teas held in the Union
every Thursday afternoon for Stanford
women and their friends.
