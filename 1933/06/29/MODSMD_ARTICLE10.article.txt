# "Las Tapatias" Night In Mexico Proves Success
## 
### 
The summer season of programs
sponsored by the Public Exercises Com
mittee opened Tuesday evening with a
recital of Mexican songs and dances
by "Las Tapatias"â€”Elena, Berta, and
Clotilde Lindeman and Emilia Linde
man Rathbun.
Their first group of numbers came
from the simple and beautiful songs
of the Mestiza Indians, who migrated
from Yucatan to the north of Mexico
and were kept there in bondage. These
Indians live and work in the fields and
their songs are the outgrowth of their
love of nature, and deal with such sub
jects as "Little Perfume Blossom" and
"Beautiful White Dove." They were
sung in the Lindeman sisters' own ar
rangements, without accompaniment.
This group closed with "La Sandunga,"
a funeral chant of haunting pathos
which is sung at Mexican funerals. It
supposedly represents the grief of a
boy who has gone away from home
and returns to find his mother dead.
The Colima Indians at market were
the subject of the second group. The
good-natured gossiping and displaying
of wares of the jovial peasants, gath
ered together for a day of merriment,
was given in song and pantomime. The
high spot was the light-hearted love
making of the group, and the quarrel
ing of two of the girls over their lover.
"A Night in Mexico" concluded the
programs and gave many of the songs
of festival days ,including the always
popular "Paloma." The hilarious and
rhythmical outbursts of Mexican holi
day songs were varied with love songs
of the race, with their lilting and grace
ful dances. "El Rancho Grande," a
farce in song and dance on Mexican
domestic life, was most appreciated by
the audience ,who called the singers
back for numerous encores. The cos
tumes for this group were Mexican
dresses, resplendent in color and bril
liance, each representing three months
of tiresome sewing.
Pablo Fedelin and Mariano Flores
accompanied the singers on mandolin
and guitar and provided several in
teresting numbers in the intermissions.
