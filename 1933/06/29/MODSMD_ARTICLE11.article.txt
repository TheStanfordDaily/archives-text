# Sword and Sandals Hold Tryouts Today
## 
### 
Tryouts will be held at 4:30 o'clock
this afternoon in the Little Theatre for
those desiring to participate in the first
of three readings to be given this sum
mer by Sword and Sandals, honorary
dramatic society.
All students are invited to try out,
including freshman women, who are
eligible for summer quarter dramatics.
It is hoped that the turnout will be
fairly large, as there are more than a
dozen parts open.
The first play to be read is Philip
Massinger's "A New Way to Pay Old
Debts," an Elizabethan comedy with
all the gusto and hilarity of the period.
It will be presented on July 12.
Sword and Sandals' readings were
instigated two years ago under Vallejo
Gantner and James Sandoe in order to
increase the dramatic activities of the
University, which are always severely
curtailed because of financial limita
tions. They offer a wide field of experi
ence to students who may not be able
to qualify for work on the regular
stage.
