# Clark To Give Second Of Art Series Tonight
## Fifteenth Century Italian Artists To Be Theme Of Lecture Precision A Characteristic Of Period 
### 
Discussing "Fifteenth Century Italian
Artists," Professor Emeritus A. B. Clark
will lecture tonight at 8 o'clock in the
Little Theatre.
This will be the second of a series
of six lectures in which Professor Clark
is presenting the substance of his
course on Art Appreciation.
Artists to whom Professor Clark will
give attention in this evening's lecture
are Donatello, Ghiberti, Basaccio, Fra
Filippo Lippi, Signorelli, Botticelli, and
Ghirlandajo. They drew their inspira
tion from varied sources and painted
with more precision, detail, and indi
vidual purpose than the artists of pre
ceding centuries.
These artists treated of secular sub
jects as well as religious subjects.
Artistically speaking, they attained a
mastery of the human form. It was an
era of joyous expansion and growth, al
though the mature climax of the re
naissance was not attained until the
next century.
Next Thursday evening Professor
Clark will continue with a dissertation
on the Italian Artists of the sixteenth
century. In both lectures his remarks
will be supplemented with lantern
slides, illustrating the qualities of each
artist's work.
Following lectures in the series will
develop the study of the development
of art down to the present decade, fea
turing a treatment of the nineteenth
century schools of art and the present
tendencies. Consideration will also be
given to the influence of photographic
art as well as geometric and color
plastic abstractions.
