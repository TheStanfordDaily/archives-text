# NOLAN'S ACTING FINEST
## 
### 
One of the recent Stanford men to
get a foothold in theatrical New York
is Lloyd Nolan, whose performance in
"One Sunday Afternoon," which is still
running, is considered the finest piece
of acting of the year.
Kenneth Stewart, former editor of
the Stanford Daily and now instructor
in Journalism here, has joined the staff
of the Literary Digest in New York
for the summer.
