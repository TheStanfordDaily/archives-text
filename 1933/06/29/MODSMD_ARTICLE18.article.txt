# OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS UNHEARD

Opportunity knocks not once, but often, during the Summer Quarter
at Stanford. Unfortunately there are few receptive ears. Already a vast
fund of information and entertainment has been offered to those who
heard Chinese scholar Tsu, historian Guy Stanton Ford, or Professor
emeritus A. B. Clark. The directors of the Summer Quarter have mapped
out a program which will maintain the same high standard of lecturers
throughout the remaining nine weeks.
At the first of Professor Clark's six lectures on the history of art a
good-sized audience heard a remarkable appreciation of the Italian artist
Giotto. But that good-sized audience was made up almost entirely of
faculty members, with a sprinkling of graduate students, and an even
fewer number of undergraduates. Nor was there any great preponderance
of undergraduates at the other two intellectual banquets.
Shallow students often voice one paramount objection to all University
courses: The courses are not of the type likely to furnish a broad cultural
background without any exertion on the part of themselves. For this type
of student, of whom there are unfortunately a goodly number, the Clark
lectures on Art and its appreciation are ideal. These sluggish individuals
can sit back and drink in names of artists and masterpieces with the usual
facility of rote-memorizing with which lazy persons are endowed.
The Clark lectures, and indeed all lectures to be delivered on the cam
pus this summer, are of course much better suited to genuine students.
For these few isolated minds, the lectures will provide a guide through a
veritable labyrinth of learning, instilling in the listener a confidence in
himself and a foundation for advanced intellectual journeys into strange
seas of thought.
