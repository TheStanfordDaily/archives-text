# FOURTH OF JULY

Since University officials have always expressed a preference for
mauve brown fields rather than the lustrous black variety, firecrackers
will not be permitted on the campus grounds, according to Gordon Davis,
who bears the picturesque appelation of the "Campus Cop." This move
has been forced by the great fire hazard which exists in the many dry
fields on the Stanford grounds.
Expressions of Independence Day exuberance are certainly justifiable
in their proper place, however, so firecrackers, Roman Candles, Big
Jumbos, Caesar's Castles, Hawaiian Waterfalls, and all the rest of the
glorious array will be permitted in the relatively safe bed of the tempor
arily extinct Lake Lagunita.
