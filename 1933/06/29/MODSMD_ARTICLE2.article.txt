# STANFORD TRACK STARS TO COMPETE IN A. A. U. MEET
## 
### 
With eight Stanford men bolstering
its squad, the Olympic Club of San
Francisco enters the A.A.U. track meet
in Chicago tomorrow and Saturday
heavy favorites in spite of strong com
petition from the New York Athletic
Club.
The Winged "O" team counts on
Gordon (Slinger) Dunn, Here Laborde,
John Lyman, and Bob Jones to give it
a good share of the points in the weight
events.
Gus Meier, Stanford's flashy hurdler,
is expected to win the high hurdles
and should take several more points in
the lows for the San Francisco team.
Gus ran a world record-tying 14.2 race
two weeks ago. His teammate, Alden
Herbert, should reverse the order to
come in near the front in the lows
and place in the highs.
Two more Indians who will be count
ed on to bring victory to the Winged
"O" are Bill Miller and Bud Deacon,
high-soaring pole-vaulters. They should
do better than 14 feet.
