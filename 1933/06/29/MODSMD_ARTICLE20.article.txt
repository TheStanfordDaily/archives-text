Surounding the Stanford campus, and indeed within the wide stretch
which includes the University property itself, is some of the most beautiful
country in Northern California. Campus residents who come from a more
rainy part of the country should not be misled by the sunburnt, brown
fields near the Quad and Library. Just five miles back of the campus, and
even nearer in a few isolated spots, are small waterfalls, shady glens, and
clear, running brooks which would have delighted the heart of any nature
poet of the 18th century.
Summer Quarter students who are unacquainted with the Skyline
Drive, the Big Basin, the Giant Redwood forests, and countless other
natural beauties within an hour's drive of the campus, would do well to
spend a few hours in seeking out the real glories of the place they have
chosen for their summer's work.
