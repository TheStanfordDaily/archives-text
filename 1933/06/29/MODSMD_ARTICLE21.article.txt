of Education, has been edited by Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur, and will be the
second book of the "School Economy
Series," which the Press is publishing.
This series embraces a group of eight
volumes on various subjects relating
to administrative problems in present
day school systems.
"Economics of Mining," the most re

deals with a phase of mining which has
heretofore been neglected, but which

published this summer. However, the
recent receipt of seven new titles for
fall publication indicates a busy season
at that time.
More than a third of a million-dollar
fund for Jews in Germany, being raised
in New York, is in hand.
