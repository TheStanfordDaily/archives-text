# Undergraduate Women Now Rooming In Union
## 
### 
The expected influx of women on
the Stanford campus next fall is re
sponsible for a change in the summer
quarter plan in women's residences, for
it has been found convenient to close
Roble and transfer undergraduate wo
men to the Union.
This done primarily to eliminate the
expense of keeping Roble open for ap
proximately fifty women, and also to
experiment with the facilities of the
Union, which will be retained as a
women's dormitory next fall. Under
the system that is being tried girls en
gage their rooms in the Union and
board is provided for them in the
Union dining-room and cafeteria.
