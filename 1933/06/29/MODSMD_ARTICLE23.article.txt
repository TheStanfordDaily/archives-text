One hundred and fifty miles of 2-
inch iron pipe is used in the giant re
frigerating system used to cool off the
concrete in Boulder Dam as fast as it
is poured and set. Such a huge mass
as Boulder Dam would require cen
turies to get rid of the excess heat
without artificial aid, and the process
would result in dangerous open joints
or cracks.
