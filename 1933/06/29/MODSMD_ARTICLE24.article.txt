THE WORKING MAN—At the Stan
ford Theatre.
George Arliss gives another good per
formance in "The Working Man." The
picture .somewhat similar to "The
King's Holiday" in which Arliss also
starred is ideally suited to the actor's
congenial personality, and his ability
to make the most of the many humor
ous situations found in the plot drew
numerous laughs from the audience.
The story is a light comedy, dealing
with the ups and downs in the rival
ries of two famous shoe companies . . .
One is run by Arliss with the help of
his nephew, played in fair fashion by
Hardie Albright, the other is run by a
corrupt manager for the two children
of one of Arliss' competitors, who dies
just as the plot opens.
Bette Davis does a good piece of act
ing as one of the two children, eventu
ally falling in love with Arliss' nephew
as the story unwinds itself into a series
of fast-moving climaxes that leave the
audience well satisfied with the out
come. —C.D.
VODVIL FROLIC—At the Menlo Cir
cus Club.
An old-fashioned "vodvil frolic" was
presented Saturday night at the Menlo
Circus Club under the direction of
Harold Helvenston, Standord director
of dramatics. The show climaxed a day
of sports and festivities held for the
benefit of the Stanford Convalescent
Home under the auspices of the club.
The production included many stars
noted for their work here on the cam
pus, among them Barbara Collins, Paul
Speegle, Eph Engleman, Katrina Wal
lingford, Virginia Wilson, Beulah Dim
mitt, and George Wilson. Waldo Salt
wrote several of the sketches.
Eph Engleman and Paul Speegle
shared the honors of master of cere
monies, while Griff Williams, Stanford
graduate and pianist for Anson Week's
orchestra, returned to the peninsula to
repeat the piano duet which he and
Engleman first gave in the 1932 Football
Gaieites. Paul Speegle and Katrina
Wallingford won enthusiastic applause
for Miss Wallingford's farce, "Even
More Private," a satire on Noel Cow
ard's "Private Lives." An imitation of
Mae West by Beulah Dimmitt and
backed by a chorus of burlesque girls,
was also well received. Songs and
dances were given by "Las Tapatias."
The revue was given on a Reinhardt
circus theatre stage, designed and
erected by Helvenston in the old horse
show ring of the club. Stage and light
crews were also composed of Stanford
students. —E.F.
