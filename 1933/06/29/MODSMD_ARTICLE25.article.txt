# DOUBLE BILL AT THE VARSITY THEATRE ALL THIS WEEK.
## 
### 
"Tonight Is Ours," Frederic March
and Claudette Colbert; "Ann Carver's
Profession," with Fay Wray.
A pleasant double bill. "Tonight Is
Ours" concerns Claudette Colbert, who
was royalty but ran away and became
a champagne woman. When all the rest
of royalty was killed off, she became a
queen and sad. Fred March comes back
by the postern gate, and all is again
witty and lovely. There is a duchess,
not too frank and consquently very
\amusing. There is a Parisian taxi
driver whose mustaches are real; he
appears for a moment driving into the
camera, and is the best of a good show.
Mrs. Carver wanted a career; her
husband was a football star. He be
came a crooner so that he could keep

up with her. The result is an ingenious
accidental death, a trial for murder,
and, since Mrs. Carver's profession was
law, the husband is acquitted. He asks
for sun and air. She gives him son and
heir. The show is as good as the pun.
The difficulty with the latter show
is one of most talkies. Only one person
can talk at a time. To keep the thing
moving the characters and camera keep
moving without any purpose or reason
and the audience finally moves as ner
vously as they do. Thus court scenes,
as in Ann Carver's Profession, are more
successful, for the camera can move
swiftly over the principal witnesses.
When the lawyer addresses the jury,
the camera can flash the reactions of
jury and audience.
Even the news reel reviews two sets
of troops, and demonstrates how trav
eling salesmen can send in orders by
carrier pigeons. No statistics are given.
