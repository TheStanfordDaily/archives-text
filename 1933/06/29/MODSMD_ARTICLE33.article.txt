## Tells Of Radical Change In Dramatic Standards Of Students 
### 
A radical and unwholesome change
has taken place in the dramatic stand
ards of college students, according to
Harold Helvenston, director of campus
dramatics.
Writing on "West Coast Audiences,"
in Theatre Acts "Helven
ston remarks, "Today we find our
selves confronted with audiences who
will not be satisfied with anything that
is outwardly known as clean and forth
right. For example, plays by Sir James
Barrie are too slow, two sentimental, in
many instances they are regarded as
just so much sweet drivel.
"Even Shakespeare's appeal is dubi
ous, depending on the number of well
known names in the cast and perhaps
the cutting; few college students will
give up dancing or other activities to
see Shakespeare," Helvenston declares.
To be sure of success a university play
must be thought of in terms of those
authors who present modem life in
smart dialogue and unusual if not neu
rotic plots."
In these days box-office appeal is a
necessary factor for the university
theatre to consider, according to Hel
venston. The triangle play if presented
from an unusual angle, comedies, fan
tastic and idea plays when well adver
tised, and satirical plays, he says, are
most likely to be successful.
