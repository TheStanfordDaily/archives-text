# "URBAN ATTITUDES" WILL BE TOPIC OF SOCIOLOGY SAVANT
## 
### 
Dr. Howard Brown Woolston, well
known sociologist from the University
of Washington, and acting professor of
sociology at Stanford for the summer
quarter, will deliver the second of the
regular Wednesday afternoon lectures
at 4:15 o'clock, July 5. His subject will
be "Urban Attitudes."
Concerning the title, Dr. Woolston
says: "City people act differently from
country folk. Why? Because they are
exposed to peculiar urban conditions,
to which thy must adapt their behavior.
Some of these circumstances, and the
sort of conduct arising therefrom will
be described. Furthermore, when many
persons are so adjusted to life in towns,
they tend to express their prevailing
wishes collectively in characteristic
ways. Some of these corporate urges
will be discussed. If urban communities
may be said to have personality how
do they develop it?"
Dr. Woolston has lived in many great
cities in America and abroad, among
them Paris and Berlin. He is interested
in trying to define the human factors
that make these places so distinctive.
During the war, Dr. Woolston was a
major in the American Red Cross and
manager of the Serbian Relief in
France.
