# 'Queen Louise' Is Subject Of Ford Lecture
## Historian Paints Queen Of Prussia As Romantic Figure 
### 
Queen Louise of Prussia will be
remembered not because of the great
things she accomplished, but because
she is the one romantic and sympa
thetic figure in the hard, practical mili
tary life of Prussia at the time of
Napoleon. This was the manner in
which Dr. Guy Stanton Ford, visiting
professor of history, and dean of the
graduate school at the University of
Minnesota, finished his talk yesterday
afternoon at the Little Theatre.
During her reign as queen she saw
the German armies driven from Prus
sia and Napoleon triumphant. She even
had an interview with the French
leader to plead for her native land. He
refused her plea and the peace he
granted to Prussia was a harsh one.
She kept working to restore Prussia.
Most of the work fell on her shoulders
because the King, Frederick William
111, was in reality a petty monarch.
Dr. Ford declared, "he would have
made a wonderful commander of a
regiment where he co.uld see that every
button was shined to the last degree."
He was a very dull and serious person
while the Queen was fond of gaiety
and dancing. Naturally this made their
private life very dull for the Queen.
But she never shirked or complained, a
loyal wife to the end. Queen Louise
was the mother of King Frederick Wil
liam IV and of William, who later be
came Emperor.
