# SLIGHT CURTAILMENT OF CELLAR SERVICE IS UNION DINING HALL'S ONLY SCHEDULE CHANGE
## 
### 
In an effort to maintain as nearly as
possible the previously announced
schedule for summer quarter in the
Union dining-halls Christine Ricker,
director of the University Dining Halls,
indicated yesterday that, at present, in
spite of the low registration, the only
change will be a curtailment of the
Cellar service. However, unless present
patronage is maintained further reduc
tions are probable.
According to Miss Ricker: "The
Union is trying in every way to meet
the needs of the summer students.
With the rather low registration it is
found impossible to maintain the same
hours we had hoped to in the begin
ning of summer session. Beginning to
morrow the Cellar will be open daily
from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. After 5 p.m.
cigars, cigarettes, etc., are to be sold
from the soda fountain. Also, anyone

wishing candy, shavnig cream, or sun
dries has only to ask at the soda foun
tain and a clerk will be glad to wait
on him.
"The main dining-room will be open
for lunch and dinner every day except
Saturday. The Sunday dinner is a spe
cial feature and is a very pleasant way
to entertain one's friends.
"The cafeteria will be open Monday
to Friday inclusivey for breakfast,
lunch, and dinner. We are making a
special feature of the fresh summer
vegetables.
"The Stanford University Dining
Halls are operated on a non-profit
basis and through co-operative buying
and scientific dietary practices are
making a genuine effort to provide a
varied and pleasing service. Such an
endeavor, however, is obviously de
pendent upon continuous student pa
tronage during the summer months."
