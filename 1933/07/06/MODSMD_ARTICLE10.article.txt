# Urban Attitudes Forced Upon Us, Woolston Declares
## 
### 
"Urban attitudes are not due to bio
logical inheritance but to the pressure
of circumstance," said Howard B.
Woolston in his talk yesterday at the
Little Theatre. Attitudes in the city
are forced upon us, we must live ac
cording to type or city life is impos
sible.
Dr. Woolston, visiting sociologist
from the University of Washington,
started his lecture by pointing out how
peasant life in Europe differed with
that of Paris. He then showed how the
press of circumstances makes the city
man's life so different from that of the
rural dweller.
Country Life More Leisurely
In the city there is a drive and strug
gle for success and existence that is
lacking in the country where life is
more leisurely. Ideas, transportation,
industry, and life are in constant tran
sition. People do not even relax when
they play in the city. There is a con
stant friction and strain. Under such
conditions mental breakdowns and
suicides are more common than in the
country.
The individual in the city is engulfed
by immense numbers of people, crowds
are around him at all times. Since in
dividual contacts are rare, great stress
is laid on wealth and front. For this is
about the only way people have of
judging their neighbors.
Cities Develop Atmosphere
Cities and even districts of cities de
velop a certain atmosphere and tradi
tion. For example Paris is known for
its fashion center, London for finance,
and Rome for art. While in New York,
Wall Street is associated with finance,
and Broadway, with the theatrical
world.
The city may become a great guide to
progress if we are able to control it.
But unless we do, very serious conse
quences will result, Dr. Woolston be
lieves.
