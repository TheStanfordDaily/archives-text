# Stags Pay Dime At Union. Dance Tomorrow, 7-8
## Jolly-Up To Mark Campus Debut Of Canfield's Gardens Band Couples Will Be Admitted Free Of Charge 
### 
Tomorrow evening, from seven until
the money runs out, is the time set for
the first all-University jolly-up of the
summer quarter. The dance will be
held in the Women's Clubhouse and is
being sponsored by the Associated
Women Students, through whose ef
forts this social event is offered to
summer quarter students without
charge.
The value of a Stanford girl was
found out today when it was learned
that free admittance to the dance holds
good only for those men who are ac
companied by a lady. Which means
that stags will have to pay one thin
dime unless they can hustle up a date
with whom they can dance to the
rhythmic music of the Canfield's Gar
dens orchestra. This is the first ap
pearance of the five musicians who
make up the orchestra.

The possibility of extending the
dance until after 8 o'clock, the normal
closing time for this type of campus
affair, depends upon the amount of
volunteer contributions received to pay
the orchestra for overtime.

Justine Jankowsky, president of the
A.W.S. for the summer quarter, is in
charge of the dance, which was first
suggested in the editorial column of
the Stanford Daily.
