# THE 						QUARTER BEGINS, SOCIALLY
## 
### 
Two weeks of the summer quarter are gone—weeks of social stagna
tion—but tomorrow night the "New Deal" begins. Presaging eight
weeks of dances, teas, "get-togethers," picnics, and increasing friendli
ness, the first dance of the quarter will be held in the Women's Clubhouse,
sponsored by the women residents of the Union. Courageously overlook
ing the bear market in finances and females, Stanford women have gone
ahead with plans for an inexpensive, informal dance, as suggested in the
editorial column of the Daily.
Decorations will be few, but there will be no scarcity of good will and
laughter. If you like Anson Weeks better than the Union orchestra, re
member that you'll have ample opportunity to listen to the radio for the
rest of the evening, but will seldom have such a golden chance of grabbing
off one of the "45."
The desire for a dance early in the summer quarter has been so great
among the male portion of the student body, that the Union women could
have easily charged 50 cents or $1 for stag admissions.
Rumors from Toyon indicate that the male stronghold is planning an
ambitious mid-summer dance, which will compare favorably with the
famous Toyon dances given during the autumn, winter, and spring quar
ters. It looks as though the Union is starting a real ball rolling tomorrow
ters. It looks as thoug lithe Union is starting a real ball rolling tomorrow.
One "verb sap" regarding the Union jolly-up:
Don't be chary about "cutting-in"! This indoor sport is a favorite one
on the Stanford campus. You are not expected to know many of the "45"
this early in the quarter (if you do you're a better man ....); but if you
don't know them all by 10 o'clock tomorrow night, you'll deserve a D- in
