# STUDENTS OF MINE
## 
### 
This morning the Daily prints the first of a new series of articles:
"Students of Mine." In presenting this additional feature, the Daily
hopes to narrow the wide valley which almost necessarily divides faculty
members and summer quarter students who are at Stanford for only ten
weeks.
These articles, written either by the professor himself, 01* as an inter
view by a staff member, will be concerned with alumni who have "made
good" in some line of activity: science, business, drama, literature, schol
arship, or any other of the arts and sciences. Space limitations will re
quire these articles to be short, but even the handicap of unnatural brevity
should not conceal their real worth.

In connection with the "Students of Mine" series, the editorial column
of the Daily will present a telescoped biography of the professor whose
article appears in that day's issue.

Students and alumni are accustomed to speak in vague terms of
Stanford as an intellectual center, as the of the West." But
few of them realize the full import of their own words. The academic
staff at Stanford is truly remarkable —certainly unequalled by that of any
other Western university of its own size. Afraid of becoming isolated
from the principal centers of learning and culture —New York, Paris,
London, Berlin, and Vienna —Stanford has not only bridged countless
miles by the extra-University activities of its faculty, but has established
a cultural center of its own.

Students registered here are already well enough acquainted with the
Stanford of national and international athletic significance. These "Stu
dents of Mine" articles, therefore, will jndeavor to point out the careers
of graduates who have achieved distinction in other lines of activity,
primarily as a result of training at a university which can attract such
men as Dr. Petersen from Berlin and Dr. Lossky from Prague to the
barren and savage frontier wastes of the Pacific Coast.
