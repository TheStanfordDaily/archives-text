# HOOVER NO LIBRARIAN
## 
### 
A silly story is going around the newspapers that Herbert Hoover
will be Librarian of Stanford â€”a bit of hasty carelessness by those who
started it and of stupid credulity by those who printed it. Hoover is
going to edit and direct work on some of the records in the 1 loover War
Library. He knows about the activities behind those records; he has
written history. This is work he likes and knows how to do. Stanford
has a trained librarian.
