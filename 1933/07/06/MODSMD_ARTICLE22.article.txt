THE EAGLE AND THE HAWK—At
the Stanford Theatre.
The picture is good, the plot is fair,
some of the acting is not so good, but
why Carole Lombard in the headlines?
She merely drools through a couple of
hundred feet for no good purpose at
all, unless it is to make Frederic March
a little happier; but how any man can
be made happy by Carole Lombard is
still a mystery, perhaps "c'est la
guerre!" Let's hope so. March does his
best to improve on one of the worst
roles with which he has had to con
tend. Cary Grant is still good-looking
in a uniform and Jack Oakie can still
draw a laugh out of the audience, but
when March has a nightmare and
waves his arms without being blotto,
as he usually is in this story, we re
signed ourselves to the cause of Peace.
Lest we forget, the plot is concerned
with war, the hideous, nerve-wracking
conditions of a war ace's life at the
Front, and a little bit of playtime at the
Rear.
A "Looney-Tune," a Sports Short on
wrestling that was pretty limp, a fair
hey-hey, row, dow, dee, dow college
comedy, and a news reel can be seen
for twenty-five cents, if you want to
sit hard.
WHEN STRANGERS MARRY and
SUNSET PASS — At the Varsity
Theatre.
The current show at the Varsity is a
double feature, the first picture, "When
Strangers Marry," is rapid-fire romance
with Jack Holt carrying the main role
in his usual nonchalant fashion. Lil
lian Bond, Holt's big love, does a fair
piece of acting opposite him. The Wild
West, six-shooters, sheriffs, and hosses,
hold the lead in the second feature,
Zane Grey's "Sunset Pass," with Kath
leen Burke, "The Panther-Woman,"
and Randolph Scott carrying the pic
ture.
