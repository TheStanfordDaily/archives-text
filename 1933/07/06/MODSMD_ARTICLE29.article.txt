# STANFORD SHELL EXPERT RETURNS FROM CONFERENCE
## 
### 
Mrs. Ira Shepard Oldroyd, curator
of the Geology Department and one of
the country's foremost conchologists,
has just returned from Cambridge,
Massachusetts, where she represented
Stanford at the annual conclave of the
American Malacological Union.

Stanford will act as host to the so
ciety in the spring of 1934, Mrs. Old
royd's nationally known collection of
sea shells being the focal point of the
convention. This society, composed of
conchologists, those interested in the
shells of marine animals, and mala
cologists, those interested in the or
ganisms contained within these shells,
was first organized in 1930 and the
meetings at Stanford next year will be
the first in the Far West, which area
holds one-fifth of the society's mem
berships.

During her month's absence from this
campus Mrs. Oldroyd visited several
museums in the East and gathered
duplicate *>hells from the National Mu
seum in Washington, D.C., the Ameri
can Museum in Washington, D.C., the
American Museum in New York City,
and from Cambridge, Massachusetts.
She also helped in the classification of
some Philippine shells in the famous
Mitchell collection at the Philadelphia
Academy of Arts and Sciences.
Coming to Stanford in 1916, Mrs.
Oldroyd, with her husband, began a
collection of marine shells that is now
most noted for its value to research
students of paleontology. Always a
hobby with her, Mrs. Oldroyd has
classified thousands of marine shells
which have been placed on exhibit on
the third floor of the Geology Building.
Assisting Mrs. Oldroyd in her work
is Professor Junius Henderson, just re
tired from service at the University of
Colorado.

Summer sessions have dropped in
enrollment from 18 to 40 per cent in
the country as a whole. Chicago is an
exception, on account of the World's
Fair.
