# Toyon Youth Keeps Bike In Room! Affection Or Precaution?
## 
### 
Residents of Toyon have been sur
prised of late to see a frosh serenely
cycle down the hallways.
The frosh manipulates his wheel with
great acumen, thus dissipating any
impression that he might have been
imbibing. On arriving at his door he
dismounts cautiously and disappears
into the privacy of his room, taking
his bike with him.
Some claim that the rider tucks his
bike in bed with him; others insist that
he merely is quite fond of the cycle
and takes it in during the cold dark
ness of the night for safety's sake.
Whatever the reason—a few mo
ments before eight of the morning he
appears again, pedalling his way
through the lobby doors and away—
into the outside world.
