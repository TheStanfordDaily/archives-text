## 
### 
Stressing the fact that Italian artists
of the fifteenth century were strong
individualists and exponents of an in
tense realism, Professor A. B. Clark
devoted the second of his lectures on
Art Appreciation, given last Thursday
evening in the Little Theatre, to the
gradual development of realistic pro
portions and three-dimensional per
spective in the work of the men of this
period.

Professor Clark mentioned Donatello
as among the first to contribute to this
new art of precision. The growing pas
sion for the study of the human figure
is shown by Signorelli, in whose paint
ings we are able to see the muscles of
the body. Fra Filippo Lippi proceeds
another step, Professor Clark said, by
embodying the same clearness of form
in his pictures as was previously found
in sculpture.

Botticelli is an example of how the
classic poets served as inspiration for
dramatic expression in art.
Professor Clark will give the third of
his six lectures tonight and will deal
with Italian artists of the sixteenth
century.
