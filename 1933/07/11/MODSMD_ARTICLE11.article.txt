# Secretary School Releases Agenda For Confab Here
## 
### 
Pursuing a program which has been
characterized by Leonard E. Read,
manager of the western division of the
United States Chamber of Commerce
as being "the last word in timeliness as
well as a careful analysis of the 'New
Deal' as it relates to the work of Cham
bers of Commerce," the Western
School for Commercial Secretaraies will
meet at Stanford July 17 to July 21.
Secretaraies who plan to attend this
conference are cautioned to submit
their applications to Dean J. Hugh
Jackson of the Stanford Graduate
School of Business, as advance regis
tration indicates the group will more
than fill Branner Hall, the campus
dormitory which has been selected to
house the attendants. Rooms at Bran
ner and board at the Stanford Union
will be available for the five days at
$10, and the conference tuition charge
is $15.
