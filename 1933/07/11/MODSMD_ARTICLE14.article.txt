Professor Aurelio Macedonio Espi
nosa, head of the Romanic Languages
department, has been a guiding and
influencing hand to a large group of
students of Spanish during his teach
ing career, which began at the Univer
sity of Colorado in 1901.
Recalling some of these students to
mind, Professor Espinosa named among
them, Professor Laurence Deane Bail
iff, who is now head of the department
of Spanish at the University of Cali
fornia at Los Angeles. Professor Bailiff
took his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees under
Dr. Espinosa after graduating from the
Spanish department in 1918. With Dr.
Bailiff at U.C.L.A. is Professor Ernest
Templin, instructor in Spanish verse
and considered a leading authority on
the Spanish Literature of the "Golden
Age." Templin received his doctor's de
gree at Stanford in 1926 and returned
in 1931 as a visiting professor while on
leave from U.C.L.A.
Another of Dr. Espinosa's more
prominent students is Miss Gwladys
Louise Williams, who has attained emi

nence as a translator and research
worker for the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace. Miss Williams
was given the doctor's degree at Stan
ford in 1927 after graduating from the
University of California.
Professor Stuart Cuthbertson was
examined for his M.A. by Professor
Espinosa. Professor Cuthbertson has
since become an authority on Spanish-
American literature and at present
is teaching at the University of Colo
rado. Among the Stanford professors
that have been instructed by Professor
Espinosa is Dr. Margery Bailey, now a
member of the English Department.
Among the students who graduated
from the Spanish department at Stan
ford, but who have not turned to the
teaching of the language and its allied
subjects, Professor Espinosa recalled
Angel D. Aguerrevere, now a promi
nent lawyer in Caracas, Venezuela;
Everett Bailie, who is the Spanish in
terpreter for the Fox Film Corporation
in Los Angeles; and Miss Ruth Eliza
beth Partridge, the Assistant Registrar
of Sacramento Junior College.
