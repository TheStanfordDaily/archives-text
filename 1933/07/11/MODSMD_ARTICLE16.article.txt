# Kreps To Talk Tomorrow On "Economic Mythology"
## 
### 
"Economic Mythology" will be the
subject of a talk by Professor Theodore
J. Kreps of the Stanford Graduate
School of Business at the luncheon of
the education department tomorrow
noon. This will be the first of the series
of lectures which will continue weekly
until August 9.
Professor Kreps will show the group
that the present talk of a universal
"gold standard" is really unnecessary.
He will also explain many other mer
cantile fallacies.
