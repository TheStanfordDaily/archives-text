# CONGRATULATIONS, PALO ALTO
## 
### 
Middlefield Road became the Broadway of Palo Alto on Friday
night when Palo Alto's new Community Theatre had its official opening.
The California Spanish building, set square in the center of Rinconada
Park, formed a striking contrast to the conventional first-night adorn
ments â€”flashing lights and chauffered cars and taxis, men and women in
full dress, everywhere an atmosphere of anticipation.
The interior of the theatre proved even more pleasing than its digni
fied outward aspect. A gift of Mrs. Louis Stern to the city, the theatre
was erected at a cost of $44,000. Such an astoundingly low figure ac
counts for the simplicity which is the most striking characteristic of the
building. If the theatre had cost $15,000 more it might be much less
pleasing to the eye, for its greatest virtue is a complete lack of ostenta
tious decoration. The accoustics and seating arrangements are as good
as any on the Pacific Coast. The seats are wide and comfortable.
Thus Palo Alto is presented with an opportunity to become an im
portant leader of the Little Theatre movement. The greatest apprehen
sion of Palo Alto playgoers should be the fear that the local group will
confine itseuf to the usual limitations of that movement.
The Little Theatre movement should be the most virile driving force
in American drama. Destined by its size to be unsuccessful as a com
mercial enterprise, the Little Theatre should not be forced to regulate
its artistry to the taste of any one clique or group. The demands of the
pseudo-intelligentsia who have patronized the Little Theatres during the
last decade have at times been ridiculous, and almost always stupid.
The general tendency among Little Theatres is to produce either plays
which may be compared in literary technique and merit to the poetry of
E. E. Cummings and his imitators, or plays which were written at the
turn of the century, and which are very dull to a 1933 audience.
"Grumpy," the opening play at the Community Theatre, was of the
latter type. Though harmless enough, this rather ancient favorite is
very slow, and is a "one man play." Only the remarkable acting of
Dr. James Graham Sharp carried the audience through the interminable
second and third acts.
The second play on the Community Theatre program is to be "Grow
ing Pains," written by a Palo Alto woman, Aurania Rouverol. While
this comedy is a far better play than "Grumpy," it is probably not the best
that could have been procured.
Palo Alto is to be congratulated on the fine gift it has received. But
it should also remember that a beautiful theatre does not guarantee a
successful dramatic enterprise.
