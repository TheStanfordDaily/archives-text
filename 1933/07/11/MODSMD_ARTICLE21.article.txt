						FINE START

### 
Opening the social season with a ninety-minute jolly-up Friday night,
the Union women disproved all predictions of a dismal summer quarter.
The Canfield's Gardens orchestra proved satisfactory, but eminently
more so was the fine turnout on the part of the much-publicized "45."
The most humorous anecdote told after the dance concerned the lad who
asked a very pretty girl if she were a freshman and was told that she
was the vice-principal of the high school he had graduated from two years
ago. And there was another story about the most popular girl of the "45"
who was "taken home" by 14 boys.
