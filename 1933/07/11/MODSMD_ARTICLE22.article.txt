# APATHETIC READERS

### 
The editorial board regrets a peculiar apathy in summer quarter
readers, which has prevented them so far from communicating their
grievances and appreciations with the "Campus Opinion" letters which
usually enliven the Daily's columns. While this dispassionate sluggish
ness may be traced to a variety of blessed evils such as the proximity of
Searsville Lake on warm afternoons and of San Francisco on cool nights,
the disease should not be incurable.
