GRUMPY—At the Palo Alto Com
munity Theatre.
The opening play of the new Palo
Alto theatre, which was produced on
Friday and Saturday nights, was a
"one-man show" with Dr. James Sharp
as the ancient criminal lawyer who
solves all the mysterious difficulties
which threaten to keep apart the ju
venile protagonists, played by Anthony
Morse and Peg Randall Converse. Al
though Mrs. Converse gave her usual
distinguished performance, the acting
of Morse seemed little improved over
the days when he was a leading high
school Thespian. Dr. Sharp, however,
was the one actor who managed to keep
the play going. The action was ex
tremely slow, and was hampered by
listless performances on the part of the
minor characters. The technical side of
the production was handled for the
most part by Palo Alto youngsters who
had little experience, but the settings,
particularly Jarvis' room, were rather
good.
HILLSBOROUGH SYMPHONY, July 9.
Directing the second of the Hills
borough symphony series, Dr. Howard
Hanson, American composer-conductor
and Director of the Eastman School of
Music, Sunday afternoon scored a tri
umph with his own second symphony,
"Romantic." Among the conductor's
friends in the audience were two of his
former associates at the College of the
Pacific, Warren D. Allen, Stanford or
ganist, and Dr. Tully C. Knoles.
Following a cleverly chosen mouth
ful of Wagner, the Lohengrin Act 3
Prelude, the "Romantic symphony,"
with its free harmonies, its crescendo
repetitions of simple themes, its drum
accented rhythmic passages, was re
freshing in its modern clarity and
proved the composer's success in pro
ducing work "young in spirit, lyrical
and romantic in temperament, and
simple and direct in expression."
Dr. Hanson, substituting the edu
cator's pointer for the musician's baton,
explained the Three American Dance
Movements, which followed the inter
mission, as truly indigenous American
music. "The only reason more Ameri
can folk-songs have not been brought
to light," said Dr. Hanson, "is that
people have been too busy saying they
don't exist to look for them."
COLLEGE HUMOR—At the Stanford
Theatre. Now playing.
This is a good choice for those who
enjoy light satire. The plot is centered
about a mythical "Midwest University."
It features the hilarious career of cocky
Jack Oakie as a gridiron hero.
Bing Crosby appears as a crooning,
love-shy professor, who unwittingly
wins the affections of Mary Carlisle,
the campus coquette. Richard Arlen is
cast as a football idol, who loves love
able Mary and is unkindly expelled
from good old Alma Mater for drunk
enness.
Whenever the story slips into seri
ousness, there are weak scenes. One of
the worst is when Arlen, thunder
struck by his expulsion, wanders sob
bily into the deserted stadium.
Sopped by a downpour of sad Holly
wood rain, he stands alone in his tra
vail.
But Oakie is at his clownish best.
Aided by Burns and Allen, he offers
many chuckles. The musical numbers
are cleverly executed and Mary Car
lisle is sweet to the eye.
There is a Mickey Mouse short which
is screamingly funny. Mickey's home
made mechanical man wins a giddy
battle from a gangly gorilla, amidst de
lirious excitement.
A Hal Roach comedy that is riotous,
and at times clever, fills out the laugh
bill.
Even the news reel is unconsciously
droll. Herr Hitler draws a huge roar
with his butter-churning gestures, as
he appears squawking soprano admoni
tions to his followers. —H.H.

It features the hilarious career of cocky
Jack Oakie as a gridiron hero.
Bing Crosby appears as a crooning,
love-shy professor, who unwittingly
wins the affections of Mary Carlisle,
the campus coquette. Richard Arlen is
cast as a football idol, who loves love
able Mary and is unkindly expelled
from good old Alma Mater for drunk
enness.
Whenever the story slips into seri
ousness, there are weak scenes. One of
the worst is when Arlen, thunder
struck by his expulsion, wanders sob
bily into the deserted stadium.
Sopped by a downpour of sad Holly
wood rain, he stands alone in his tra
vail.
But Oakie is at his clownish best.
Aided by Burns and Allen, he offers
many chuckles. The musical numbers
are cleverly executed and Mary Car
lisle is sweet to the eye.
There is a Mickey Mouse short which
is screamingly funny. Mickey's home
made mechanical man wins a giddy
battle from a gangly gorilla, amidst de
lirious excitement.
A Hal Roach comedy that is riotous,
and at times clever, fills out the laugh
bill.
Even the news reel is unconsciously
droll. Herr Hitler draws a huge roar
with his butter-churning gestures, as
he appears squawking soprano admoni
tions to his followers. —H.H.
GRUMPY—At the Palo Alto Com
munity Theatre.
The opening play of the new Palo
Alto theatre, which was produced on
Friday and Saturday nights, was a
"one-man show" with Dr. James Sharp
as the ancient criminal lawyer who
solves all the mysterious difficulties
which threaten to keep apart the ju
venile protagonists, played by Anthony
Morse and Peg Randall Converse. Al
though Mrs. Converse gave her usual
distinguished performance, the acting
of Morse seemed little improved over
the days when he was a leading high
school Thespian. Dr. Sharp, however,
was the one actor who managed to keep
the play going. The action was ex
tremely slow, and was hampered by
listless performances on the part of the
minor characters. The technical side of
the production was handled for the
most part by Palo Alto youngsters who
had little experience, but the settings,
particularly Jarvis' room, were rather
good.
HILLSBOROUGH SYMPHONY, July 9.
Directing the second of the Hills
borough symphony series, Dr. Howard
Hanson, American composer-conductor
and Director of the Eastman School of
Music, Sunday afternoon scored a tri
umph with his own second symphony,
"Romantic." Among the conductor's
friends in the audience were two of his
former associates at the College of the
Pacific, Warren D. Allen, Stanford or
ganist, and Dr. Tully C. Knoles.
Following a cleverly chosen mouth
ful of Wagner, the Lohengrin Act 3
Prelude, the "Romantic symphony,"
with its free harmonies, its crescendo
repetitions of simple themes, its drum
accented rhythmic passages, was re
freshing in its modern clarity and
proved the composer's success in pro
ducing work "young in spirit, lyrical
and romantic in temperament, and
simple and direct in expression."
Dr. Hanson, substituting the edu
cator's pointer for the musician's baton,
explained the Three American Dance
Movements, which followed the inter
mission, as truly indigenous American
music. "The only reason more Ameri
can folk-songs have not been brought
to light," said Dr. Hanson, "is that
people have been too busy saying they
don't exist to look for them."
COLLEGE HUMOR—At the Stanford
Theatre. Now playing.
This is a good choice for those who
enjoy light satire. The plot is centered
about a mythical "Midwest University."
