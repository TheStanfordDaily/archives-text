player, will be swimming for the
L.A.A.C. and will compete in the 220
backstroke. Swimming against him will
be Fred Tebbetts, unattached.
Bob Clark, Stanford swimmer, is ex
pected to be competing unattached this
week-end at the A.A.U. meet in Chi
cago. The "expected" is necessary,
since, according to Nort Thornton,
swimming coach, Clark hoped to enter
West Point this summer. If, however,
he is not able to enroll, he will be
swimming the 440-yard breaststroke
and the 300-metre medley. He will
have a good chance of winning the
medley event since he has bettered the
intercollegiate record by 22 seconds.

"Freshman," appearing in a San Fran

really covers the games from an un
biased standpoint.
Joe Hickey, '02, new football com
missioner of the Olympic Club, is ex
pecting a very strong team for next
season. Players have been recruited

ta Clara, St. Mary's, Washington State,

swimming coach, Clark hoped to enter
West Point this summer. If, however,
he is not able to enroll, he will be
swimming the 440-yard breaststroke
