# "Being Made Over" Subject Of Sermon By Dean Brown
## 
### 
Reverend Charles *v. Brown of Yale
University occupied the pulpit in the
Stanford Memorial Church Sunday.
His sermon on "Being Made Over" was
a message of hope and confidence in
the fulfillment of life's purpose.
Remarking that all life has been a
progressive movement toward light,
from lower to higher and more gentle
existence, the Reverend Brown said,
"The complete answer to the cynic is
the love of man for his fellows and his
God."
To those who find life drab and
meaningless, he advised a diet of right
thoughts as a "delicate nutriment to be
taken into one's nature." In right
thoughts, hope and companionship
with the Divine spirit lies man's fullest
being.
