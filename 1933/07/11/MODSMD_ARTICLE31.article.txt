# HAND DESCRIBES MODERN GUIDANCE WORK ACTIVITIES
## 
### 
"Our modern guidance activities are
representative of the effort of present
day educators to keep abreast of the
times." Thus Dr. Harold C. Hand, act
ing associate professor of education at
Stanford for the summer quarter, re
cently characterized the theme of the
conference on Guidance and Personnel,
now being held at Stanford.
Dr. Hand is a recent addition to the
local faculty. His former position was
that of instructor in secondary educa
tion in the Teachers College, Columbia
University. His part, as assistant di
rector, in the Carnegie investigation
of outcomes of programs of guidance
in secondary schools qualifies him as
one of the leading authorities on this
subject in the country.
"The common conception, held by
most people, is that guidance relates
only to choice of vocation, whereas vo
cational guidance is but one phase of
the problem. In former years, in a so
ciety of relatively limited means of
existence, vocational guidance domi
nated the show; but today, on the eve
of a new economic order, educators are
faced with the problem of preparing
youths to make choices which formerly
did not arise. So modern guidance is
conceived in terms of social-moral,
health, recreational, and vocational
guidance."
According to Dr. Hand, the gist of
the problem is to individualize mass
education. "In 1890, less than 4 per
cent of our adolescents were attending
public secondary schools and had in
mind, in practically every case, the
pursuit of one of a small number of
professional occupations. Here guid
ance was relatively unnecessary for
curricula were largely stereotyped. To
day, however, with nearly five millions
of students attending our secondary
schools having to choose, in many
cases, from a course list of over two
hundred subjects, the problem of judg
ing abilities and providing the indi
vidual with a logical basis for choice
is a large one."
The advance of economic organiza
tion and perfection of distribution can
be only a few years in the future and
at this time people are going to find
themselves with a great deal more
leisure, Dr. Hand believes. This in
tensifies the importance of guidance,
and places on the shoulders of modern
educators the responsibility of equip
ping the young of today to do an in
telligent piece of work in revising their
| life-programs.
