# Clark To Lecture On 17th Century Art Appreciation
## 
### 
Leaving the Italian painters of
Renaissance, Professor A. B. Clark
will continue his series of lectures
on Art Appreciation at 7 o'clock
next Thursday evening in the Little
Theatre, with a talk on "Seven
teenth Century Visualist Painters."
He will discuss the Dutch painter,
Rembrandt, famous for his court por
traits of the nobility and the Flemish
Rubens, whose pictures of the last days
of Christ are praised for their use of
light and shade. These two men led the
schools which superseded those of
Florence and Venice.
Professor Clark will also speak on
Velasquez, one of the most noted of
the Spanish artists, and Hals, another
Dutch painter.
In the lecture delivered last Thurs
day night, Michelangelo and Leonardo
de Vinci were specially stressed; Mi
chelangelo as an artist whose strength
and personality are reflected in his
work, and who considered himself pre
eminently a sculptor, so that in his
drawing lite emphasis is upon form and
balance. Among his most famous works
are the mural paintings on the ceiling
of the Sistine chapel.
Leonardo de Vinci concerned
himself not only with painting, but
with sculpture, science, and even an
early experiment in flying. He is re
puted to have said: "Anything that
man can do, I can do."
Clark spoke at some length on the
"Last Supper," which hangs in Milan.
He also mentioned Raphael and Cor
reggio as the other two of the great
four, and showed several examples of
the excellent coloring in Titian's work.
