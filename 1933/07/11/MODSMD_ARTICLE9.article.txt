In order that visiting professors'
wives might become acquainted with
the regular members of the Faculty
Women's Club, a program was given
at the Women's Clubhouse yesterday
afternoon.
Dr. O. L. Elliott, registrar emeritus,
talked on "Early Days at Stanford."
He supplemented his own reminiscence
with descriptions of the University's
early development from letters of some
of the first students enrolled here, in
an effort to capture the point of view
of the undergraduate in opening years
of Stanford history. Particularly of in
terest were the accounts of one of the
school's first co-eds, a woman who ma
triculated in 1891 and whose corres
pondence, during the four years of her
work here, contained a fascinating ac
count of the embryo University.
Eliot G. Mears, director of the sum
mer quarter, gave a welcoming talk.
Two violin solos, "Song of Meditation"
and "Serenade," were played by Mrs.
James H. Smith, accompanied by Mrs.
Charles Moser.
The hostesses included: Mrs. Kirk
wood, Mrs. Storey, Mrs. Davidson, Mrs.
Danforth, Mrs. Green, Mrs. E. G. Mar
tin, Mrs. Long, Mrs. Hoover, and Miss
Hayes.
