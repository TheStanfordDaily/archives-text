on "Measurement of Aptitudes in
Guidance" at the general meeting of
the conference on guidance and per
sonnel last night.
Professor Bell dealt with the apti
tudes on which measurements are
needed by the guidance worker and
the purposes for which information
yielded by measurement of aptitudes
may be utilized in guidance work.
Speaking on "Measurements of In
tents in Guidance" Professor Edward
K. Strong, Jr., of the psychology de
partment, afforded the conference a
study of differences of men engaged in
various occupations, in terms of inter
ests. As a phase of his analysis, Dr.
Strong indicated the change of inter
ests which occur with age.
Carnegie Findings
The findings of the Carnegie Insti
tute research on effectiveness of guid
ance programs were presented by Act
ing Dean Grayson N. Kefauver of the
education department at the Tuesday
evening session. He set out the ob
jectives of guidance and the nature of
the study made, as well as the findings
and methods of data collection. This
work has been conducted during the
past three years under a $10,000 en
dowment from the Carnegie Institute.

Acting Associate Professor of Educa
tion Harold C. Hand presented the con
clusions of the research based on in
vestigations of eleventh-grade students
in 10 cities.

He indicated the urgent need for
improved guidance service and pointed
out that in one of the schools studied
only 8.7 per cent of the students who
had chosen a college to attend had
a knowledge of the requisites for ad
mission thereto. The highest score made
as a mean average among these schools
was 58 per cent.
Test Statistics
In another of the tests it was shown
that only 54.3 per cent of the students
in the school testing highest under
stood what subjects were required for
their graduation.
The conference continues today with
Professor Hand addressing the general
meeting on "Courses in Educational
and Occupational Information in Sec
ondary Schools."
Dr. C. Gilbert Wrenn will lecture on
the topic, "Counseling with Students
in the High School and Junior College."
The session will convene in room
214 at 7:30 o'clock.
