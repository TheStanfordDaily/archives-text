# Cornish Players Present Comedy Tuesday Evening
## 
### 
"The Heathers At Home" will be
presented by the Cornish Players in
the Assembly Hall Tuesday evening at
8 o'clock. The play will be open to the
public without charge.
The Cornish Players are composed
of graduate students of the Department
of Theatre, Cornish School, Seattle.
They have received national recognition
for the artistry of their productions.
For the 1932 season the Players offered
Marivaux's "Love and Chance," one of
the representative French plays of the
eighteenth century.
"The Heathers At Home" is a mod
ern comedy which blithely considers
one phase of American domesticity. In
it the playwright, W. A. Kimball, has
given a truthful and humorous picture
of a typical, middle-class family in re
volt against its domineei-ing head.
Although the play is primarily com
edy, the playwright's keen but kindly
sense of satire and his realistic drawing
of the characters give it a weight and
a reality that one finds only too seldom
in the modern theatre.
