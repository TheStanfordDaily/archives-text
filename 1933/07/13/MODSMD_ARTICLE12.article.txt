rent Halleux, second violin, Germain
Prevost, viola, and Robert Maas, vio
loncello.
Americans "Interesting"
Onnou says: "We find the music of
contemporary Americans very inter
esting. Much of it has originality that
is lacking in the music of the younger
European composers. You have com
paratively few composers, but their
music differs as widely as that of dif
ferent countries of Europe. The feeling
underlying American music is not the
same as in Europe, although the ma
terials and technique may be remini
scent of European styles. It is import
ant that Americans should hear this
music, so we play it in our programs."
Last summer the quartet gave a con
cert in Toyon Hall that was enthusias
tically received.
Program Given
Haydn Quartet in B Flat, Opus 33,
No. 2; Beethoven Quartet in C. Major,
Opus 59, No. 9; Ravel Quartet in F
Major.
The Pro Arte Quartet has played 127
concerts in the largest cities in Europe.
Tickets are on sale at the summer
quarter office and at Keeble's, Palo
