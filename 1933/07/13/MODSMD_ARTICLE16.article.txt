# STANFORD POETRY
## 
### 
No body of critics, excepting perhaps the editors of the small, non
commercial magazines, are more acutely aware of the many viscissitudes
of modern poetry than the vast army of college poets. Every American
university and college has a dozen or more hungry-looking students who
read poetry all day, write poetry all night, and prepare their Economics
assignments at meal-times.

The accepted critics, poets, and editors of large magazines are gener
ally rather skeptical of "revolutionizing" poetic innovations. They point
out that Milton and Donne are far from being out-moded, while the
relics of many literary cliques of the early 1920's lie rusty in the sad
limbo of "one-issue" magazines, and privately published volumes of
"modern" poetry.
Many of the movements which originate in the little magazines and
college publications overcome this barrier of complacent, cynical criti
cism, however, and ultimately do find their way into the public eyeâ€”
quite justifiably.
In spite of any external considerations, much college poetry is not
only entertaining, but significant. Because it believes this lyrical enthu
siasm should be encouraged, the Daily is starting a new feature: "Stan
ford Poetry."
Starting next Tuesday, the Daily will print short poems by anyone
who is connected with Stanford. Contributions from faculty members
as well as students are invited. An arbitrary limit of twelve lines has
been set, but longer poems of exceptional merit will be accepted. Miss
Alice Cooper's class in "Verse Forms" will contribute its best poems to
the series.
Poems should be mailed to the Editor, Stanford Daily. Unavailable
poems will be returned if enclosed with a stamped, self-addressed en
velope. No payment can be made for poems at the present time, but any
donations for prizes will be gratefully received.
