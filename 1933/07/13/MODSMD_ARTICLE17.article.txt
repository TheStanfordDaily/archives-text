# SIN RAISES ITS UGLY HEAD
## 
### 
Sin has raised its ugly head in the Stanford classrooms! The par
ticular misdeed to which we refer is interrupting professors in lecture
courses—either to contest some statement or to point out that the speaker
neglected to mention so-and-so, or merely to say: "I agree with you
perfectly, Professor Arbuthnot!" Extreme as is the last example, it
has been noted several times during the present quarter.
There are certain classes where class discussion is invited, and forms
a valuable addition to the course. But unless a statement is made to the
contrary at the beginning of the quarter, lecture course professors are
supposed to do all the talking.
Individual arguments and clarifications of obscure points have their
proper time: either after the lecture or during the professor's office hour.
Although many speakers grin and bear all interruptions, they cannot
always refrain from mentally condemning their tormentors. Thus the
primary purpose of the loquacious student, to impress the professor of
his erudition, is defeated.
The necessity of absolute quiet is this: Good university courses are
not the result of a few weeks' preparation on the part of the professor,
but are constantly being revised and brought up to date. They are of a
highly organized, often literary, framework, which is enhanced by mental
revisions which are made while the professor is actually talking.
Nothing is more annoying to a speaker than to have some member of
the class bring up a question which was being reserved for later in the
lecture.
A good professor is not simply droning what he knows by heart,
though his tone of voice may indicate this. He is mentally active all the
time —perhaps preparing a careful phrase which will clarify some difficult
didactic consideration ....
An imbecilic interruption does not help him complete the phrase.
