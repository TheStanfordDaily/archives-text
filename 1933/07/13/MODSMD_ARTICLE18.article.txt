# THREE VERSIONS OF CAMPUS TIME
## 
### 
The Stanford student has always in the past had a choice of two
times: Western Union, or campus.
Now he not only has this choice, but even one between three
varieties of campus time. The fife whistle, the chimes, and the new
clock on the Inner Quad all bear different interpretations of campus time.
It is disconcerting, to say the least, to those who make a habit of
checking their watches with the clock as they stroll down the Quad to
find the chimes differing with the clock—-and the whistle offering still
a third choice.
While it may be asking too much for Stanford time to check with
Western Union, it would be convenient to have the three campus me
diums agree.
