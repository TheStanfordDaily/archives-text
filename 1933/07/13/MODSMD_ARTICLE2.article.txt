# Stover Chooses Bright Comedy For August Play
## 
### 
"The Mad Hopes" by Romley Brent
has been selected as the play for pro
duction some time in August. It is a
three-act comedy built about the
fluctuating fortunes of the Hope fam
ily, and is filled with humorous situa
tions and sparkling lines which make
it particularly suitable for summer en
tertainment.

The play was first brought out by
Belasco and Curran in Los Angeles,
starring Billie Burke as the mad Mrs.
Hope. It later appeared at the Broad
hurst theatre in New York under the
direction of Bela Blau.

The author has for several years
been a popular stage comedian. His
technique and rollicking sense of the
comic is carried into the construction
of his play.

Additional tryouts will be held this
afternoon at 3 o'clock for those who
were unable to attend last night.

All those who tried out last night
are requested to look on the Green
Room bulletin board, room 203 in the
English Building, some time today, and
to attend this afternoon's tryouts if
their names are posted.
Rehearsals will start Monday night,
according to Fred Stover, who will
direct the play. This was announced
yesterday.
