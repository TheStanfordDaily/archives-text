DOUBLE BILL—At Varsity Theatre.
This is rather pale entertainment.
"The King's Vacation" is a dragging
effort to capitalize on the artistry of
George Arliss.
The story opens in some miscellane
ous spot with Arliss as a benevolent
monarch restlessly suffering the dig
nity of the crown.
The country is facing revolt. A zealot
muffs two clear shots at the king—
which might have ended the picture.
Arliss has him ushered into his cham
bers where he dispatches a nice mono
logue on political economy. Well
pleased with this, he spares the fine
young fellow's thick neck.
Later King Arliss abdicates his
throne. The Queen, who is pregnant
with womanly intuition, releases him
so that he may return to the love of
his youth.
You know the rest. The old love,
clutching hands under a rose bower,
is forever gone. The end finds him
beaming in the understanding com
pany of his former queen.
"I Love That Man" is of far different
stuff. It relates the hectic life of Ed
mund Lowe as a suave, chatty confi
dence man who milches the unwary.
Into the story is spun the fine, incon
gruous love of Nancy Carroll, a mis
sionary worker, for bad-boy Lowe.
Nancy betx*ays Lowe into an honest
casket business under the delusion that
the partner is a "soft mooch." One fine
afternoon the partner melts out with
the partnership money.
Then, two disgruntled thieves whom
he double-crossed appear at the casket
company with a fine spray of lead for
Lowe. To save his life Lowe tries a
bank robbery with the boys. It fails
and they shoot him. Faithful to the
end, Nancy marries him just as he
wheezes out. —H.H.

I LOVED YOU WEDNESDAY—At the
Stanford Theatre.
The picture is a personal triumph for
Elissa Landi. Her performance is ex
cellent. As "Vicki," a dancer who
eventually rises to the heights of fame,
Miss Landi carries her audience from
her disappointment in love for Victor
Jory to the finding of a new friend in
Warner Baxter, an engineer whom she
meets in South America while trying
to forget the sad results of her first
romance. After some years, just when
Baxter is ready to marry her, Elissa
Landi is called on by Jory, who has
tired of his wife (Miriam Jordan).
At the same moment, Baxter comes
to keep a dinner engagement with
"Vicki" and meets Jory for the first
time. The story then weaves into a
fascinating climax, through all of which
the audience is wondering just whom
the buoyant dancer will finally choose:
the steady, competent engineer, or the
romantic, polished, and fickle husband
of the self-confident Miriam Jordan.
Popeye, the Sailor, long a featured
character of the comic strips, makes his
screen debut in a Betty Boop cartoon
and lambasts his merry way through
a reel of good comedy while carrying
on romantically with Olive Oyl, his
sweetheart of the funny papers. Mack

Sennett has produced a very poor com
edy in "Sweet Cookie," the other pic
ture on the program. It has no plot,
no acting, no humor; nothing but lots
and lots of pie-throwing. A good news
reel completes the show. —C.D.
