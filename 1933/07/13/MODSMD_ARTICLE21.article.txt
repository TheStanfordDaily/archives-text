Joe Coughlin, Card net star, de
feated Malcolm Hill, 4-6, 7-5, 6-0,
6-3, yesterday to reach the semi
finals.
Cementing his position as one of the
rising stars in the tennis world, Joe
Coughlin, Stanford tennis ace, advanced
to the quarter-finals of the Longwood
Bowl tennis tournament on Tuesday,
when he defeated Don Morrison, 7-5,
6-4. Sam Lee, another Indian player,
also advanced to the quarter-finals
when he defeated the highly-touted
Wilmer Hines of Columbia, North
Carolina, 6-0, 6-2, in a surprisingly
one-sided match. The Longwood Bowl
tournament is one of the classic mid
summer Eastern tournaments, and gen
erally proves a good test for the young
er players. It is being held in Brook
line, Mass.
Rumors have been circulated that
crew would be reinstated as a regular
sport here next fall. Crew was aban
doned many years ago for financial
reasons and the lack of a convenient
place to practice. Stanford will defi
nitely not be represented by an
"eight" next season.
The A.A.U. swimming meet to be
held in Chicago for three days start
ing tomorrow, will be given increased
significance by Stanford-U.S.C. rivalry
in the 100-meters, and 440- and 880-
yard swims. In these races Ted Wiget
will be competing against Trojan Gil
hula, who during the summer wears
the colors of the Detroit Athletic Club.
Wiget will be swimming for Stanford.
Faculty members and students who
would like to play volley-ball can sig
nify their desire by signing lists in the
gymnasium. If a sufficient number in
dicate willingness to play, a group will
be arranged. â€”Clumeck
