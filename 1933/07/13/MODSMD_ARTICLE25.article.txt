Of particular interest at Stanford on
account of the connection of Herbert
Hoover and Ray Lyman Wilbur with
their production are the volumes of
publications of the White House Con
ference of Child Health and Protection
included in the Century Company's
display in the textbook exhibit.
The thirty or more volumes in this
collection form the most complete li
brary pertaining to childhood ever pro
duced.
The conference, which was held in
1930, was called by Herbert Hoover as
President of the United States, and Dr.
Wilbur, then Secretary of the Interior,
was general chairman.
