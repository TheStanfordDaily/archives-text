Dr. Nikolai Lossky, former professor
of philosophy at the University of St.
Petersburg, and now in practical exile
from Russia because of his political
and religious views, is professor at
Prague.
In his courses on organic realism and
Slavic religious philosophy, he offers
Stanford students an opportunity to
gain information on the development
of two of his most noted theories. Dr.
Lossky is one of the principal leaders
of the modern realistic movement
which opened the struggle against

idealism, and is closely allied with the
new Slavic religious movement.
A doctor's dissertation devoted en
tirely to the work of Dr. Lossky, of
which he had previously been unaware,
was discovered in the Stanford library
upon his arrival.
