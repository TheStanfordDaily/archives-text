# JULIUS PETERSEN SPEAKS ON "PEACE" IN GERMAN WRITING
## 
### 
"In the two thousand years of Ger
man literature six ideas of mankind for
universal peace have been developed,"
said Dr. Julius Petersen of the Univer
sity of Berlin in opening his lecture,
"The Idea of Universal Peace in Ger
man Saga and Literature," yesterday
afternoon.

First, the mythical ideal of the Gold
en Age is the poetic conception of the
aesthetic type of man. Second, the
theocratic ideal which appeals to the
religious man. Third, the imperial ideal
of world monarchy inspires the man of
power. Fourth, the philosophic-humani
tarian ideal which is gained through
the use of education appeals to the
intellectuals. Fifth, the federative ideal
of a union of all peoples. Sixth, the
communistic ideal of complete equality
in economic and social fields.
"All of these concepts succeeded and
repeated others in the development of
German literature. The concept of the
Golden Age, which was to return after
the burning of the world, made the ac
ceptance of Christianity easier for the
German tribes. The dream of Germany
for a world kingdom of peace wherein
all men were united died away during
the era of Napoleon," Dr. Petersen
said.
But from the Renaissance came the
conception of the third age, the spirit
of the empire; the man of power idea.
Although this idea died out for a period
preceding the World War it is now
dominant in German life. The disap
pointments caused by the League of
Nations and Marxism revived in Ger
many have had much to do with its
return.
Doctor Petersen closed his lecture by
saying it is the German way of think
ing to fuse extreme opposites, and the
union of nationalism and socialism is
the ideal inspiring the German youth
of today.
