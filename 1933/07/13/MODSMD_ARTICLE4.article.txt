Talking on "Economic Mythology,"
Professor Theodore J. Kreps of the
Stanford Graduate School of Business
addressed the education department at
its weekly luncheon yesterday noon.

Kreps explained how present-day
educational ideas are not always sound,
many being unnecessary. Due to the
numerous points of discussion in his
talk, Kreps remained for some time at
the conclusion of his lecture to amplify
them.
At the regular meeting next Wednes
day, the speaker will be Dr. Edgar E.
Robinson of the Stanford history de
partment. His topic will be "The Need
of Liberalism."
