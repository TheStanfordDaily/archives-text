# Visualists' Art To Be Subject Of Clark Lecture
## 
### 
Continuing his lectures on Art Ap
preciation, Professor A. B. Clark will
speak on "Seventeenth Century Visu
alist Painters" in the Little Theatre at
8 o'clock tonight.
Among the artists of this period to
whom he will give special attention are
Rubens, Rembrandt, Hals, and Velas
quez, who represent the entrance of
Spain and the Netherlands into the
field of painting and the trend away
from Italy toward a more international
art.
The work of these four men is often
considered as the first contribution to
the modern school. Their enriched
technical conception and execution of
subject matter marks a distinct advance
over the earlier masters, who were
concerned with light and shade and a
growing excellence of form.
This will be the fourth of a series of
six lectures into which Professor Clark
is compressing the material of his
course on Art Appreciation.
