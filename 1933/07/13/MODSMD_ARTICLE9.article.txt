# AMERICAN MUSIC IMPROVING, SAYS HENRY COWELL
## 
### 
American music is gaining in world
recognition, according to Henry Cowell,
nationally known music authority. He
spoke Tuesday night in the Stanford
Assembly Hall on "What American
Composers Are Doing."
Cowell pointed out that the term
"American music" is slightly ambigu
ous. America, he said, is such a great
melting pot of nationalities that we
cannot put American folk music in the
same classification as French, German,
or Russian music, for example.
The great problem facing American
composers today, said Cowell, is that
of preserving in our folk tunes the
characteristics that are essentially
American.
Charles Ives of Connecticut, Carl
Ruggles of Vermont, and Roy Harris of
California were cited by Cowell as
three of the leading American com
posers of the day. Ives was mentioned
because of the successful manner with
which he preserved the characteristics
of American folk tunes; Ruggles be
cause of his studies in melodic out
line; Harris for his true Americanism.

Cowell believes that one does not
have to forsake older composers in
order to enjoy these three men.
