# Guidance Meet Banquet Brings Confab To End
## 
### 
Marking the completion of the first
conference on guidance and personnel
to be sponsored by Stanford, as well as
the first attempt in the West to bring
together specialists in these fields, the
convention closed its sessions with a
banquet and meeting Saturday night.
State Superintendent of Schools
Vierling Kersey addressed the banquet
guests, discussing the issues guidance
workers have to face. Dr. Franklin
Keller, director of the national occupa
tional conference, which is supported
by the Carnegie Corporation, spoke on
its scope and purpose.
Dean-elect Grayson N. Kefauver of
the School of Education sketched the
probable direction of social change in
terms of school people. The banquet
was attended by more than 100 per
sons.
Including in its 10-day program an
exhaustive treatment of the guidance
and personnel problems in secondary
schools and colleges, the conference
met in daily group discussions as well
as in general sessions.
Dr. Kefauver, under whose direction
the conference was held, was pleased
with the competence of the group, the
sustained interest in its program, and
the quality of their contributions to the
discussions. He also declared that in
coming to California, he is pleased to
note the extent to which programs of
guidance have been developed in sec
ondary and higher institutions and the
stress in training given at Stanford in
the preparation of workers.
