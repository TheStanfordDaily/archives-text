# Cornish Players Here Tonight
## 
### Amelia Baer 
Mr. and Mrs. George B. Heather and
family will be at home informally—
completely off-guard, in fact—when the
Cornish Players present W. A. Kim
ball's tart comedy of the American
bourgeoisie, "The Heathers At Home,"
in the Stanford Assembly Hall tonight
at 8 o'clock. The play is being dix-ected
by Alexander Koiransky.
Members of the company appearing
in "The Heathers At Home" are: Ver
non Worthingham as George B. Heath
er, domineering head of the household;
Martha Nash as Julie Heather, his con
sistently pleasant consort; Myrtle Mary
Moss as Lotty Hill, their elder daugh
ter; Ford Rainey as Bertie Hill, her
easy-going husband; Charles Trainor as
Mack Heather, the son, and Mary
Louise Bennett as Elsie, his wife—both
still young enough and in love enough
to be always gay; Morgia Lefebvre as
Bessie Heather, the rebel in the fam
ily; Edgard Johnson as Fred Swanson,
the grocery boy; Arthur De Huff as
Oscar Smith, Mr. Heather's secretary;
Keinert Wolff as Dr. Graves; and Don
May as Mike Heaton, a contractor.
The play revolves ai'ound the head
of the family, George B. Heather. For
years his slightest wish has been un
questioned law—and his wishes, it
seems, have sprung from a paternal
delusion of grandeur. He seems par
ticularly opposed to anything which
might cause even a mild sensation of
pleasure. The liberation of his patient
and long-suffering family is brought
about by a reverse in his fortunes and
it is with this that the comedy con
cerns itself.
Glen Hughes, noted commentator on
the modern theatre and director of the
Division of Drama, University of Wash
ington, says of "The Heathers At
Home": "It has been a considerable
time since I have seen a comedy of
American family life more amusing or
more true than this. It must be classed
with 'The Show-off,' 'The Goose Hangs
High,' and 'Another Language,' as one
of those plays which are so true that
they ought to hurt, but do not because
they are so enjoyable. In 'The Heathers
At Home' you will find your uncle or
your cousin or your next-door neigh
bor—perhaps even yourself—and you
will be pleased with the experience."
The Cornish Players touring group,
composed of graduate students of the
Department of Theatre, Cornish School,
Seattle, Washington, have won national
recognition. The Cornish Little Theatre
was founded in 1917 by Ellen Von Vol
kenburg and Maurice Browne, both of
whom have never lost their interest in
the Cornish Group.
Late arrivals will not be seated until
the end of the first act.
