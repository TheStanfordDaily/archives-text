# Indians, Gaels Seek Return Of
## 
### 
That Alfred R. Masters, general man
ager of the Board of Athletic Control,
has been negotiating with St. Mary's
College for a future meeting on the
gridiron of the Galloping Gaels and the
Indians, was made known yesterday.
The two teams have not been matched
since 1927 when the Gaels defeated
Stanford 16-0, although the freshman
teams have maintained football com
petition between the two schools.
Possibility of a game being scheduled
for the 1933 season is very remote, in
asmuch as the bookings have already
been completed. The only available
date for next fall, December 2, is not
desirable, since it comes only a week
before St. Mary's meets Southern
Methodist and would rob the Moragans
of a rest period. Another factor which
makes this date improbable is the near
ness to finals for the Stanford players.
Were the Indians to face the Gaels
this season, they would oppose the 1930
freshman team which snowed the Card
babes under a 20-0 score. St. Mary's
will have one of the most powerful
elevens in the history of that "football
minded" college, and Stanford would
have its hands full should a game be
scheduled for 1933.
Although Slip Madigan is out of
town, Masters believes a satisfactory
arrangement will shortly be made with
regards to an open date for both
schools.
