# STANFORD-ST. MARY'S
## 
### 
Stanford and St. Mary's will probably meet on the football gridiron
in the fall of 1934.
This became known yesterday when it was revealed that negotiations
between the two schools have reached an advanced stage. Athletic di
rectors from Palo Alto and Moraga would like to schedule the game
for the coming season, but both teams have already booked heavy Pacific
C oast and intersectional engagements.
December 2 is an open date for the two squads, but two factors make
this date inadvisable: the proximity to final examinations here, and the
necessity of eliminating a "rest period" which St. Mary's has scheduled
between six successive mid-season games and the season finale against
Southern Methodist. The 1934 schedules of both teams are also fairly
well filled, but there is a strong likelihood that a juggling of preliminary
season opponents will enable the two teams to meet.
The Indians and the Galloping Gaels last played in 1927, when an
underdog St. Mary's team thrashed Stanford, 16-0. The game produced
several unfortunate incidents, particularly a fist t fight between two
players, which resulted in hundreds of verbal battles all over the stadium.
Since that time varsity football teams of Stanford and St. Mary's
have not met. This artificial prolonging of the animosity which arose
from one deplorable incident has done no good to either school, and the
decision to start with a clean slate will be welcomed with joy by sports
men throughout the country. The fact that Stanford and St. Mary's meet
every year in other sports, without friction, indicates that the renewal
of football rivalry between the two schools will not only produce good
games, but clean games.
From the standpoint of the disinterested spectator, the Stanford-
St. Mary's football series should be the most interesting on the Pacific
Coast, and will, in time, assume much of the traditional glamor that
surrounds the Big Game and the Stanford-U.S.C. "classic."
The St. Mary's style of play, a modification of the Notre Dame
system, depends on a strong running attack which employs good inter
ference rather than "razzle-dazzle" deception. This system, pitted against
the spectacular Warner style of play, should produce the best offensive
football of the 1934 season.
