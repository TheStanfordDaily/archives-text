### 
A scholar's paradise little known to the average run of summer
quarter students lies hidden at the end of one of the Library's second
floor corridors. It is the Felton Library, a comfortably furnished reading
room with deeply cushioned armchairs and shelves of fine editions, as
well as representative works from various literatures.
The Felton reading room is not designed as a study-room where the
casual student may absorb his Citzenship theories in luxury. Students
are requested to leave their own books downstairs. They are invited to
come to the Felton Library for the purpose of "browsing" through
beautiful books.
The hours are 2 to 4 o'clock, Monday to Friday afternoons.
