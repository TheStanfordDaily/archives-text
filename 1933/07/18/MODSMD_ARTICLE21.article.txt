# DON'T COME LATE
## 
### 
Announcement is made by the summer quarter office that tonight's
performance of "The Heathers at Home," presented by the Cornish
I Mayers, will begin at 8 o'clock sharp. All late-comers will l>e made to
stand at the back of the hall until the end of the first act.
By this sane ruling, a long step has been taken toward eliminating one
of Stanford's worst habitsâ€”arriving late at plays and lectures. If a
performance is scheduled for 7 o'clock, the largest part of a Stanford
audience is sure to arrive ten minutes later. If the entertainment begins
at 8 o'clock, they come just as late.
The summer quarter office has passed a good rule, hut like all good
rules, it must be strictly enforced.
Nothing is more disconcerting to a speaker or a group of actors than
to have a continual stream of late arrivals shuffle and whisper down the
aisle. The noise is particularly destroying to the rather fragile nature of
such a play as "The Heathers At Home." The Cornislf Players deserve
some consideration.
