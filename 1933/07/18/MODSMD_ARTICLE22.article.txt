REUNION IN VIENNAâ€”At the Stan
ford Theatre.
Excellent entertainment. The exiled
aristocrats hold a reunion in post-war
Vienna. That is, fine gowns, music, and
amusing and eccentric characters. The
wife of a great psychologist has a com
plex on, and had an affair with, the
Hapsburg heir who wears as fine a
profile as the Vagabond King.
She attends the reunion, almost loses
her gown, and apparently loses her
complex. However, neither she or we
are made quite sure of either point.
The fun lies in by-play and implica
tion, in the vitality of John Barrymore
and the remote charm of Diana Wynd
ward. The picture is not a Lubitsch,
but is in his best tradition.
Barrymore has two roles. One is
serious, historical, and romantic. The
subject is always his profile. The other
role is full-face and deals with comedy
of manners. In this picture the two roles
are combined. It is Barrymore's best
part in some time.
Diana Wyndward is striking and
charming in repose, handsome rather
than beautiful. She dances erectly, in
a very volatile and graceful fashion.
Some fine air shots in the news reel.
Otherwise the shorts are dull. I saw
Bobby Jones deliver the same lecture
to Joe Brown some three years ago.
Possibly Brown wouldn't learn in thrice
three years, but the audience might.
