# PRO ARTE CONCERT
## 
### 
About 300 attended the concert by
the Pro Arte quartet Friday evening.
The musical event of the quarter, the
concert was enthusiastically received
by the large audience.
The program consisted of quartets by
Haydn, Beethoven, and Ravel, and, as
encore, a movement from a Schubert
quartet. The programmed selections
represents 18th, 19th, and 20th century
selections, of which the 18th century
Haydn was the most civilized piece and
musically the best.
Musical wit today is seldom appre
ciated. This Stanford audience was ex
ceptional, for each of Haydn's sallies
received a just and appreciative re
sponse.
The Beethtoven quartet was the most
popular piece, as was to be expected.
Beethoven, in his most mature work,
fixed the conventions which we now
regard as especially moving and musi
cal. For the most general example, the
start and stop finale, was three times
repeated.
The Ravel quartet was graceful, suf
ficiently melodic, and decadent. The
Bolero, which is usually confused with
the Peanut Vendor, is the best known
of Ravel's work and the most tricky.
They are all somewhat tricky and super
ficial, and consequently have a certain
elegance. The quartet formed a suitable
diminuendo to the program.
The Schubert encore pleased some.
Wit has disappeared from chamber
music since the 18th century, possibly
because the audience is now regimented
into hard rows of theatre seats. They
are thus prepared to suffer with the
composer. Casual and irregular seating
would be inconvenient with a crowd
as large as was present Friday evening.
In general, however, more of the social
and less of the theatre atmosphere,
would add to the charm of musical
evenings.
