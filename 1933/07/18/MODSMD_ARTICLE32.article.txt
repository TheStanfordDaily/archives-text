# Wrenn Tells New Method In Reading
## 
### 
Reading comprehensively and good
scholarship are very much interrelated.
This was the point emphasized by Dr.
C. Gilbert Wrenn, assistant registrar of
student personnel, in his lecture on the
"Psychology of Reading" given in the
Little Theatre last night.
Dr. Wrenn spent a good part of the
hour discussing the methods by which
one can improve speed and comprehen
sion in reading. The varieties of work
from which Dr. Wrenn drew his in
formation were explained as well as
were the mechanics of the eye during
the process of reading.
In order to read fast as well as ac
curately, Dr. Wrenn pointed out that
the number of pauses that the eye
makes in reading a line must be
lessened, and the most effective method
of doing this is to read against time
and under pressure. And, contrary to
general opinion, with the increase in
speed there comes an increase in com
prehension, which develops because of
the concentration exerted. In order to
insure complete acquirement of the
ideals set forth in the text one is
reading, Dr. Wrenn advises the reader
to make sure of the contents of the
chapter before beginning; this can be
done by glancing over the chapter
headings and forming a mental outline
of what the author is presenting.
