THE UNTRIED POET
The untried poet, eager hound of praise,
Must dedicate his first thin book verse
To her in whom all beauty lives, and raise
Weak, mewing pleas that she will lift the curse
Of heeding not his cries. He needs must mark
His baseness, her divinity so clear;
"Her smile illumes the night; she frowns days dark;
She is the prize that all men's hearts hold dear."
Alas! that there is such a gulf between
The feelings, goals, and aptitudes of men—
One's anodyne, another's bane. One's queen
Is but another's conquest. Ah, but then
My world —as the pale poet's—has its share
Of those who cannot see the beauty there.
