### 
"Three great masters of the Dutch
and Flemish schools emerged during
the 17th century who dealt with the
poetry of vision," declared Professor
A. B. Clark Thursday night in his lec
ture on "Seventeenth Century Visual
ist Painters."
These three artists, Rembrandt, Hals,
and Rubens, plus the Spanish disciple
of the same school, Velasquez, were all
discussed in detail.
Rembrandt, the leader of the Dutch
school, painted "tangible atmosphere,
which expanded and contracted like
the deep notes from an organ filling
space with the quality of its structure,"
explained Clark. Three hundred years
after his death Hollanders consider him
to be their outstanding citizen, and a
great celebration was held in his honor.
Rembrandt especially liked to paint
his own likeness because he did not
have to wait for a sitter and could
catch and reproduce the exact mood
he was in.
Hals, also of the Dutch school, painted
with a joyous spirit and a full brush.
It was this spirit that lifted his art
above the commonplace. All of his
subjects had a dash and gaiety about
them. Rubens, the Flemish master,
liked to paint action and turbulence
all expressed in very little space.
Velasquez, the Spaniard, was a man
of facile brush and great variety of
visual attention.
