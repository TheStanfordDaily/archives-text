THE PESSIMIST SINGS OF LOVE
Love is tyrannical,
Love is a fake,
Love is satanical,
Horrid mistake.
Love is invidious,
Petty, unfair,
Venomous, hideous,
Causing despair.
Love is depravity,
Passionate pain,
Lacking in gravity,
Stupid, inane.
Love is delirious,
Creature of sin,
Priggish, imperious,
Idol of tin.
Fallacy treacherous,
Confidence sunk,
Sickening, lecherous,
Love is . . . the . . . bunk!
Frank O'Neill, Gr.
