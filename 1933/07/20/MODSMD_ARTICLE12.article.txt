## 
### 
Professor A. B. Clark will give his
next to last lecture on art appreciation
at 3 o'clock tonight in the Little
Theatre. Nineteenth century classicists,
realists, and impressionists wlil be dis
cussed in this lecture.
French painters will be given the
larger part of the talk, and Professor
Clark will tell the audience of the
achievements of Manet, France's most
important master of impression, and
from whose painting "The Garden" the
open-air school of painting arose, and
Monet, who was a founder of impres
sionism and many of whose paintings
portray nature as affected by the changes
of light and seasons. Another impres
sionist, Degas, will also be discussed.
Degas spent most of his efforts in de
veloping impressionism in pastels, etch
ings, and paintings.
The paintings of David, noted for his
composition and draughtsmanship, and
whose paintings show a decided classi
cal influence, will be examined along
with those of Ingres, who believed that
composition in painting should be based
on form and line.
Professor Clark will conclude his lec
ture with a discussion of Millet, a
painter of peasants; Daumier, a pioneer
of naturalism; Delacroix, Renoir, and
Courbet, a realist who devoted himself
largely to the painting of landscapes.
