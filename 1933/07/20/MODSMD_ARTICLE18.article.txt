# TOMORROW NIGHT, TOYON LOBBY
## 
### 
The opportunity to reward a courageous effort, and at the same time
gratify one's self, is too infrequently offered. Such an opportunity is
presented tomorrow night, when the highlight of the summer's social
activities takes place in beautiful Toyon Lobby—the informal dance
jointly, sponsored by Toyon men and Union women.
Representatives of the two organizations have completed plans for a
dance that will equal in every respect any informal dance given on the
campus during the autumn, winter, and spring quarters. These plans
have been made in the face of a particularly small student body. The
two living groups have risked a possible loss of over $50 in order to give
Stanfordites an opportunity to dance to good music, in artistic surround
ings—and without great expense. Even if the most optimistic predictions
come true, the two halls stand to lose an appreciable sum. But Toyon
and Union are facing this possible deficit with a cheerfulness that is much
to be admired.
Sam Lowry's Stanford Ambassadors, who attained exceptional popu
larity during spring quarter, furnishes very nearly the best college music
on the entire Pacific Coast. Lowry is an accomplished manager, an ex
perienced master of ceremonies. He knows how to put on a good show.
But what is far more important—he has welded his orchestra into a firm
musical unit—there are no weak instruments.
Congratulations are due, of course, to the two dance chairmen, Ted
Lynn of Toyon and Josephine Filcher of Union Club, as well as to
Bill Sim, Toyon president, and Justine Jankowsky, president of A.W.S.
during the summer.
There is one other man to whom more credit belongs, perhaps, than
to any other individual. That man is the genial and indefatigable Leonard
Bartlett, whose name once graced the managing editorship of the Daily.
As manager of Toyon, Bartlett has done much of the unpleasant work
for tomorrow's dance, though he has received few laurels.
Summer quarter students have been clamoring for almost a month
for a high-class, inexpensive dance. Here is an opportunity for them
to show the sincerity of their demands.
See you tomorrow!
