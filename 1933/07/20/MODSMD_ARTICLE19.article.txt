# SUMMER CONFERENCES
## 
### 
A feature of the summer quarter is the number of conferences being
held on the campus —there are more this year than during previous
summers. An opportunity is afforded thereby for interested persons, as
well as specialists, to attend meetings which are devoted to discussions
of live civic and educational problems. The administration welcomes
these conferences to the Stanford campus, and is glad to offer the use
of its facilities.
The Conference on Guidance and Personnel which has just ended,
proved to be a distinctly profitable experiment. It awakened great in
terest not only among graduate students here, but also attracted more
than 100 outside participants.
This week two conferences met on the campus. The Western School
for Commercial Secretaries and the Institute of Marketing are here this
week. The former organization has held meetings here for the past eight
summers and is sponsored by the United States Chamber of Commerce.
The meeting here and one at Northwestern University are the only two
such summer gatherings held anywhere in the United States. The Insti
tute of Marketing is sponsored by the California State Department of
Agriculture. It is holding a meeting this summer for the first time.
During the first week in August, the California Society of Secondary
Education will have its second regional conference on the campus. The
problems discussed will relate largely to the improvement of secondary
school instruction with the added feature that this year special attention
will be given to social and economic problems.
