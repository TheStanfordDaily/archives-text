# A
						GRACIOUS GIFT
## 
### 
Announcement is made this morning of a return concert by the Pro
Arte Quartet to be held a week from tomorrow afternoon in the Dance
Studio of the Women's Gymnasium.
This concert is the gift of Mrs. Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge to the
University. The generosity of Mrs. Coolidge will enable members of the
faculty and students to hear these foremost chamber music artists free
of charge. Over 300 persons paid $1 each to hear the first concert by
the Quartet last Friday, and left the Dance Studio eminently satisfied.
This almost unprecedented gift is corroborating evidence of what
music-lovers testify everywhere: that Mrs. Coolidge has done more than
anyone else in this country to promote interest in chamber music.
