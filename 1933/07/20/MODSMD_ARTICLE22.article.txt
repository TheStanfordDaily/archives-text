MUSIC IN THE AIR—At the Curran
Theatre.
An Alpine operetta without a single
yodel—a continental type of comedy
set to the gayest of American melo
dies, with, actually, a hero and heroine
as selfish, nasty, and wayward as peo
ple can be and still live—such is the
incredible but captivating Kern-Ham
merstein exhibit now filling the Cur
ran stage. Ingenious is hardly the word
for it—it is sheer inspiration. Hammer
stein's book is a refreshing departure
from the old technique of stolid chor
uses, Cinderella-Prince Charming situ
ations, and grand coronation finales.
It is the music, however, that makes
"Music In The Air" superb. From the
overture, with its tricky rhythms and
surprising piccolo obligatos, to the final
curtain, the melodies cavort in mad
succession. Kern is a master-crafts
man. Never for a moment does he re
lax or fall back into trite ways. At all
times his tonic combinations are hyp
notizing, and his blended scenes, in
particular, are a rare treat. These ele
ments give the show a vivacity and
abandon, without sacrifice of unity,
hitherto denied all forms of eye-and
ear entertainment. "Music In The Air"
is unquestionably as great a step for
ward in the operetta field (in technical
process, not type) as was the contri
bution of Gilbert and Sullivan.
Vivienne Segal is charming, clever,
and vocally excellent. Walter Woolf,
baritone lead, no less capable in sing
ing and acting, turns in a finished per
formance. The tunes that the audience
carries away are: "I've Told Every
Little Star," "There's a Hill," and "We
Belong Together." They are all typical,
sparkling Jerome Kern melodies. So
well handled is the action that it is
not until the next day that one realizes
with a start that there is no dancing

in the entire production.
It is interesting to note in passing
that while the plot is never sloppy,
Mr. Hammerstein neatly contrives to
bring down every curtain—and there
are eleven scenes—on a human-inter
est situation. Moreover, operetta and
musical comedy lovers will be greatly
edified to discover that, all previous
claims to the contrary, the heroine
does run true to form, and her big
heart-breaking moment, usually known
as Act Two Curtain, is safely tucked
away in the seventh scene. There is
something sacred in operetta after all.

MUSIC IN THE AIR—At the Curran
Theatre.
An Alpine operetta without a single
yodel—a continental type of comedy
set to the gayest of American melo
dies, with, actually, a hero and heroine
as selfish, nasty, and wayward as peo
ple can be and still live—such is the
incredible but captivating Kern-Ham
merstein exhibit now filling the Cur
ran stage. Ingenious is hardly the word
for it—it is sheer inspiration. Hammer
stein's book is a refreshing departure
from the old technique of stolid chor
uses, Cinderella-Prince Charming situ
ations, and grand coronation finales.
It is the music, however, that makes
"Music In The Air" superb. From the
overture, with its tricky rhythms and
surprising piccolo obligatos, to the final
curtain, the melodies cavort in mad
succession. Kern is a master-crafts
man. Never for a moment does he re
lax or fall back into trite ways. At all
times his tonic combinations are hyp
notizing, and his blended scenes, in
particular, are a rare treat. These ele
ments give the show a vivacity and
abandon, without sacrifice of unity,
hitherto denied all forms of eye-and
ear entertainment. "Music In The Air"
is unquestionably as great a step for
ward in the operetta field (in technical
process, not type) as was the contri
bution of Gilbert and Sullivan.
Vivienne Segal is charming, clever,
and vocally excellent. Walter Woolf,
baritone lead, no less capable in sing
ing and acting, turns in a finished per
formance. The tunes that the audience
carries away are: "I've Told Every
Little Star," "There's a Hill," and "We
Belong Together." They are all typical,
sparkling Jerome Kern melodies. So
well handled is the action that it is
not until the next day that one realizes
with a start that there is no dancing

in the entire production.
It is interesting to note in passing
that while the plot is never sloppy,
Mr. Hammerstein neatly contrives to
bring down every curtain—and there
are eleven scenes—on a human-inter
est situation. Moreover, operetta and
musical comedy lovers will be greatly
edified to discover that, all previous
claims to the contrary, the heroine
does run true to form, and her big
heart-breaking moment, usually known
as Act Two Curtain, is safely tucked
away in the seventh scene. There is
something sacred in operetta after all.
