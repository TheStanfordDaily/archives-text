# Dr. Robinson Lectures On Democracies
## 
### 
Pointing out the differences between
democracy in the United States and in
European countries, and the effect of
this difference on the possibility of a
Fascist form of Soviet government be
ing instituted here, Professor Edgar
E. Robinson of the history department
talked on the "Need of Liberalism" at
the weekly luncheon group of the edu
cation department yesterday.
Professor Robinson observed that
American democracy differs from Eu
ropean conceptions in that no nation
has an ideal of individuality as much
as has this one, and few nations be
lieve as we do that the vote of an
educated group of individuals repre
sents not the mere counting of heads
but the wish of an enlightened group
of people. Because of these ideals a
rule by the individual, such as is found
in the Fascist government, or a rule
in which the individual is completely
disregarded in favor of the group would
be entirely unthinkable.
The speaker granted, of course, that
the powers which have recently been
given to the president are greater than
those given to any other president, but
he said that there would never be a
complete dictatorship as some alarm
ists and agitators would have us be
lieve.
