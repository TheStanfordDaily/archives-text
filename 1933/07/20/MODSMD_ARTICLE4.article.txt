# Expert Speaks On Law Theory

"Law has changed greatly through
the ages," stated Professor Edwin W.
Patterson at his lecture on "Law as a
Means of Social Control" yesterday
afternoon.
First it was a combination of reli
gious, moral, and legal codes. But today
the religious and moral sides have been
dropped, leaving a technical system of
legal remedies based largely on cus
tom.
At present there are two theories of
law: the ideal ethical theory and the
empirical practical theory. Or the
"tender man's theory" opposed to the
"tough man's theory." The idea of an
ideal natural law leads to a static sys
tem that will not change, while the
empiric theory looks at the facts and
changes to meet the social needs of our
complex industrial society.
Law today is merely a game between
opposing private interests. As long as
this holds true law can never be a
great factor for social control. "Law at
present," said Professor Patterson, "is
only A means of obtaining social con
trol, not The means."
