# Dr. Swain Back From Europe Tells Of Scientific Advances
## 
### 
Returning from a three months' tour
of European countries, Dr. Robert E.
Swain, head of Stanford's chemistry
department and former acting-presi
dent of the University, said yesterday
that despite the depression, scientific
research work has gone ahead. During
his trip Dr. Swain contacted investi
gators carrying on important work in
the field of chemistry. He was accom
panied on the trip by Mrs. Swain.
Not only the theoretical side of sci
ence has been developed during the
slump, but research work of a com
mercial type has gained. Products havQ
been brought forth that in the next
few years will have marked commer
cial importance. For instance, synthetic
rubber formulas have been worked out
and only await a favorable market be
fore going into competition with the
natural product.

During his stay in Europe Dr. Swain
was also interested in the political, so
j cial, and economic problems facing the
European nations. He believes there is
room for an improvement in world
conditions, although at present there
is a feeling of discouragement preva
| lent .This attitude, he says, is being
j emphasized by the failure of the World
1 Economic Conference to accomplish
what the world had hoped for.
The European nations are beginning
to realize the value of the conference
; table, in the opinion of Dr. Swain.
The practice of conferring is being
adopted more freely. Precise informa
j tion on economic problems, as well as
other questions, is being used more ex
tensively as a basis for action. Most of
the nations are learning that important
1 national problems also have an inter-
I national bearing.
