# "Heathers At Home" Wins Favor Here
## Cornish Players Impress Big Audience With Pleasing Domestic Comedy 
### 
Unhinging the fourth wall of the sub
stantial old Heather house to give a
humorous glimpse of some private fam
ily matters, the eleven members of the
cast of W. A. Kimball's amusing com
edy, "The Heathers at Home," gave a
large and enthusiastic audience some
idea of the pleasant idiocies of a mid
die-class American family. The Cornish
Players, under the direction of Alexan
der Koiransky, presented the play in
the Assembly Hall last Tuesday night.
Dominating the scene is George B.
Heather, played by Vernon Worthing
ham, head of the household and re
lentless dictator of his family's inner
and outer life. Matters are somewhat
simplified for him by his wife, Julia
Heather, whose philosophy of life is
summed up in "Papa knows best." The
part was well interpreted by Martha
Nash.
Minor Characters
Myrtle Mary Moss in the part of
Lotty, the elder daughter, has inherited
her mother's disposition, but has a
boundless energy and feels that it could
sell things. Ford Rainey does excellent
work as Lotty's husband, Bertie Hill,
who has succumbed to the parental
tyranny and asks nothing more than
that he have too much to eat and in
cessant sleep.
Charles Trainor, as Mack Heather,
and Mary Louise Bennett, as Elsie, his
wife, are an especially happy couple
because they escaped the shelter of the
parental roof. Don May, as Mike Hea
ton, and Keinert Wolff, as Dr. Graves,
both furnish important bits of atmos
phere. Mongia Lefebvre as the rebel
lious unmarried daughter, and Arthur
De Huff as the bashful suitor, deserve
special comment.
Dialogue Slow
For an amateur company the enter
tainment was surprisingly well done
and very amusing. The acting lived up
to expectations, although certain por
tions of the dialogue were unnecessary
and slowed up the play. The plot at
first seemed a bit stilted and overdone
but gradually one began to feel with
George B. Heather the responsibilities
of a large family and a lai'ge diaphragm.
Composed of graduate students of the
Department of Theatre, Cornish School,
Seattle, Washington, the Cornish Play
ers Touring Group have won national
recognition.
