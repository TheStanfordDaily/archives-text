STANFORD POETRY-111 ||
MEDITATION
I gazed upon a river flowing wide,
And watched the swirling eddies skirt the edge,
Then turn and break upon a rocky ledge
To mnigle in the rapid, rushing tide.
I saw the glory of a sunset sky
Where little fleecy wisps of cloudlet gay
Enchained my sight. The gorgeous-hued array
I knew would late fade, and in the darkness die.
I stood upon a lofty mountain height
And saw the silver-threaded roads below
All twist and turn, and then together grow
Into one highway, gracious to the sight.
And now in sight of aught that may befall,
In spite of pain and sorrow and regret,
I count life's many trials each one well met
If always I these memories may recall.
Margaret G. Lomax, Gr.
