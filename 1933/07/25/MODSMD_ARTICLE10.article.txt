# Hadzsits Will Talk On Virgil
## 
### 
George D. Hadzsits, acting professor
of Latin, will lecture on the Roman
poet, Virgil, at 4:30 o'clock Wednesday
in the Little Theatx'e. The subject of the
lecture is to be "Virgil and His Italy."
Professor Hadzsits will show that
great poet as one "who observed his
country with the eyes of a poet and a
loverâ€”and gave deathless expression to
that knowledge and affection." This as
pect is shown in all his works, but
more particularly in his great
"Georgics," which dwells more on the
Italy contemporary of Virgil than does
his better known "Aneid."
"Virgil was one who had complete
and sympathetic knowledge of plants,
flowers and trees," Hadzsits says; "one
who had x-emarkable knowledge of the
land of Italy in all of its aspects of
mountains, rivers, lakes, and forests, at
all seasons of the year."
