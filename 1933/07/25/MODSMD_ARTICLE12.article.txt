# STUDENTS OF MINE

"I wonder if our students realize,"
said Professor Henry David Gray of
the English department, "how much it
means to us when they come back for
write to express their appreciation in
later life of the courses they took with
us at Stanford.
"We like to keep track of as many
of them as we can, and watch the
careers of those who came to be such
real and interesting people to us while
they were here. It is this that keeps
us looking with eagerness at each new
group that comes before us, wondering
if some of these new acquaintances will
also 'arrive' in later years, and hoping
that something we may say will be of
more use than merely that of imparting
information."
Among his graduate students, espe
cially those who write their theses or
| dissertations with him, it is the mak
ing of sound and in some cases pro
ductive scholars that chiefly interests
Professor Gray. Perhaps the most pro
ductive of his former students who has
continued the old relations by cor
respondence and by sending reprints of
his work is Walter Clyde Curry of Van
derbilt University.
Maxwell Anderson Best Known
"But it is the members of the class

in dramatic composition that would
probably interest you most," Professor 1
Gray declared. "The best known is, of
course, Maxwell Anderson, winner of j
this year's Pulitzer prize. Barret H.
Clark has just published a little book i
on 'Maxwell Anderson: the Man and j
His Plays.' Other students of mine who
have had plays produced are Aurania
Ellesbeck (Mrs. Rouverol), author of
'Skidding,' who is too well known to
need comment; Raine Bennett, Velona
Pilcher, and that most loyal of students,
Milton Hagen, who wrote an elaborate
article in the 'Dramatic Mirror' on the
playwriting course at Stanford.
"I am not sure if Glenn Hughes, who
has been doing such interesting things
at Washington University, has pro
duced his own plays. There is also that
unusual dramatist and author, Dhun
Mukerji, who when a student of mine
at Stanford, brought me his first drama.
I am still hoping for results from other
students of genuine promise: Webster
Street, Grove Day, Robert Cathcart,
and others."
"Round Table" Group Active
It is, however, the old "Round Table"
group that Professor Gray thinks of
with most pride and affection: a dozen
or so who were interested in writing
and who used to come on Sunday eve
nings to read aloud what they had done
and then all join in the discussion. At
least four of them have achieved na
tional reputations as writers.
"There was Van Wyck Brooks ,the
essayist, who though an instructor in
the department took a graduate course
with me and so became eligible. Rob
ert L. Duffus dedicated his second
novel in remembrance of the Round
Table days. An interesting 'write-up'
of Duffus, with portrait, appeared some
time ago in the Boston Evening Tran
script. Bruce Bliven, editor and staff
writer on The New Republic, speaks
with authority on public issues. Frank
Hill continued his poetic interest, and
has two volumes to his credit; he is
included in Untermeyer's 'Modern
American Poetry.'
"Others of the old 'Round Table' have
attained distinction in other lines. Frank
Weymouth in those early days showed
rare poetic ability, but now you know
him as our sedate professor of Physi
ology. Luther Boyers is a prominent
physician of Berkeley. George Ingelow
has become a popular lecturer, much in
demand. Clarence Hammond became a
professor of English at Washington
State. Sydney Hillyard, though a suc
cessful teacher, is still as full of original
ideas and sociological theories as ever.
Ernest J. Hopkins went into journalism

in San Francisco. The only one of the
old group who has eluded me is the
charming 'Bobbie' Robinson. I don't
know what has now become of him.
"They had a strong group feeling, the
old Round Table boys, and they are
friends today, after a quarter of a cen
tury. It was a 'delegation' of this group
that for some years made the New York
Globe what it was. Bliven was manag
ing editor, and Duffus, Hill, and Robin
son were editorial writers on his staff.
We still have our reunions whenever
two or three of us, or more, can get
together."

said Professor Henry David Gray of
the English department, "how much it
means to us when they come back for

on 'Maxwell Anderson: the Man and j
His Plays.' Other students of mine who
have had plays produced are Aurania
Ellesbeck (Mrs. Rouverol), author of
'Skidding,' who is too well known to
need comment; Raine Bennett, Velona
Pilcher, and that most loyal of students,
Milton Hagen, who wrote an elaborate
article in the 'Dramatic Mirror' on the
playwriting course at Stanford.
"I am not sure if Glenn Hughes, who
has been doing such interesting things
at Washington University, has pro
duced his own plays. There is also that
unusual dramatist and author, Dhun

I am still hoping for results from other
students of genuine promise: Webster

"Round Table" Group Active
It is, however, the old "Round Table"
group that Professor Gray thinks of
with most pride and affection: a dozen
or so who were interested in writing
and who used to come on Sunday eve
nings to read aloud what they had done
and then all join in the discussion. At
least four of them have achieved na
tional reputations as writers.
"There was Van Wyck Brooks ,the
essayist, who though an instructor in
the department took a graduate course
with me and so became eligible. Rob
ert L. Duffus dedicated his second
novel in remembrance of the Round
Table days. An interesting 'write-up'
of Duffus, with portrait, appeared some
time ago in the Boston Evening Tran
script. Bruce Bliven, editor and staff
writer on The New Republic, speaks
with authority on public issues. Frank
Hill continued his poetic interest, and
has two volumes to his credit; he is
included in Untermeyer's 'Modern
American Poetry.'
"Others of the old 'Round Table' have
attained distinction in other lines. Frank
Weymouth in those early days showed
rare poetic ability, but now you know
him as our sedate professor of Physi
ology. Luther Boyers is a prominent
physician of Berkeley. George Ingelow
has become a popular lecturer, much in
demand. Clarence Hammond became a
professor of English at Washington
State. Sydney Hillyard, though a suc
cessful teacher, is still as full of original
ideas and sociological theories as ever.
Ernest J. Hopkins went into journalism

in San Francisco. The only one of the
old group who has eluded me is the
charming 'Bobbie' Robinson. I don't
know what has now become of him.
"They had a strong group feeling, the
old Round Table boys, and they are
friends today, after a quarter of a cen
tury. It was a 'delegation' of this group
that for some years made the New York
Globe what it was. Bliven was manag
ing editor, and Duffus, Hill, and Robin
son were editorial writers on his staff.
We still have our reunions whenever
two or three of us, or more, can get
together."
"I wonder if our students realize,"
said Professor Henry David Gray of
the English department, "how much it
means to us when they come back for
write to express their appreciation in
later life of the courses they took with
us at Stanford.
"We like to keep track of as many
of them as we can, and watch the
careers of those who came to be such
real and interesting people to us while
they were here. It is this that keeps
us looking with eagerness at each new
group that comes before us, wondering
if some of these new acquaintances will
also 'arrive' in later years, and hoping
that something we may say will be of
more use than merely that of imparting
information."
Among his graduate students, espe
cially those who write their theses or
| dissertations with him, it is the mak
ing of sound and in some cases pro
ductive scholars that chiefly interests
Professor Gray. Perhaps the most pro
ductive of his former students who has
continued the old relations by cor
respondence and by sending reprints of
his work is Walter Clyde Curry of Van
derbilt University.
