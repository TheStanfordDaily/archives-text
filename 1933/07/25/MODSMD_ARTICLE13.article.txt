# Union Club To Sponsor Dance On Friday, 7-8
## Price Of Admission Set At 15 Cents For Jolly-Up In Clubhouse Large Crowd Necessary To Pay Expenses 
### 
Any man wishing the company of the
"45" will have to dance to the tune of
15 cents admission to the jolly-up to be
held in the Women's Clubhouse next
Friday evening, July 28, from 7 to 8
o'clock.
The dance is being sponsored by the
Associated Women Students and this
statement was made by Justine Jan
kowsky, president. The raise in price is
not due, however, to any lack of at
tendance at the last jolly-up which was
an outstanding success. The first dance
was given financial aid to the extent of
the rent of the hall and of the orches
tra, and it is to pay for those two rather
necessary things that the additional five
cents is being charged.
Differing from the last dance,
couples will not be admitted free. Each
man will have to pay 15 cents while
women will not be charged.
As yet no orchestra has been chosen
but the announcement will be made on
Thursday.
