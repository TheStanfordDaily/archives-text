# Detroit Maestro Wins Applause
## 
### 
As guest conductor at last Sunday's
Hillsborough Symphony Concert, Ossip
Gabrilowitsch, director of the Detroit
Symphony Orchestra, displayed a com
plete mastery of his music, the outwai'd
evidence of which was his working
throughout the program without score.
The principal number, Cesar Franck's
Symphony in D minor, was played with
strong feeling and altogether without
the over-subordination of part to part
which can mar the interpretation of this
continually ascending symphony.
The final number, Rimsky-Korsa
kow's "Spanish Caprice," Gabrilowitsch
led with such an extremely fine flour
ish as x'esulted in his being kept on the
stage for some minutes receiving ap
plause.
The Prelude to Wagner's "Die Meis
tersinger," the Entr'acte and Ballet
Music from Schubert's "Rosamunde"
and the Scherzo from Mendelssohn's
"Midsummer Night's Dream" were the
other parts of the concert, and all
showed by the beautifully crystallized
way in which they were conducted the
grasp of music which experience has
given the conductor.
The final concert of the series will
be given on August 6. Gabrilowitsch
will again be the conductor, and the
program will contain compositions of
Gluck-Mottl, Rimsky-Korsakow, Wag
ner, and Borodin.
Most Eastern universities are not co
educational.
