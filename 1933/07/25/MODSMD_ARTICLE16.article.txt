Henry David Gray, professor of English, provides the current
"Students of Mine" interview. Professor Gray gave us the following
instructions with the interview: "As for your official biography in the
editorial, it will he quite sufficient to say that I have been here since the
year of the earthquake." But in view of all that Professor Gray has
done for generations of Stanford students interested in literature, we do
not think this sufficient.
This professor of play writing who can write good plays himself, has
not allowed his achievements in scholarship to interfere with his appre
ciation of literature as a living force.
His "Round Table" group has been a successful stepping-off place for
Stanford writers into the world of producers, critics, "first nights," and
"hits."
Professor Gray took his undergraduate work at Colgate, gained his
A.M. and Ph.D. at Columbia, and was awarded a Litt.D. by Colgate in
1919. He has taught successively at Colgate Academy, American Acad
emy of Dramatic Arts, and the universities of Texas, Oregon, Illinois,
lowa, and London, and at Columbia and Brigham Young. During 1928-
29 he was dean of the faculty of the Floating University, and in 1929-30
was director of the British division of the American University Union.
He has been at Stanford since 1905, and is considered one of the best
Shakespearean scholars in the country.
