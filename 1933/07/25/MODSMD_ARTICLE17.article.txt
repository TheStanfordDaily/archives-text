# WELL DONE
## 
### 
Last Friday the campus was treated to the first large social event of
the summer—the Toyon Summer Club dance.
This was one of the few summer dances that have not lost money—a
net profit of $2.19 was realized.
By the whole-hearted support given this venture, socially minded
students expressed their appreciation of the effort expended by the
committee members. They did a good job.
Stanford has shown its willingness to encourage summer quarter
social life. Therefore, plans for another dance, although on a smaller
scale, are being considered.
