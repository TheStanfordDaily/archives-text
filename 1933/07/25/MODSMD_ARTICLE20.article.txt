# A LITERARY GEM

### 
From the current issue of the San Francisco Argonaut, conservator
of culture, is clipped the following:
"There has been complete lack of harmony between the Legislature
and Governor Rolph from the first moment the whirligig of fortune's
spinning wheel landed him in a heap, bewildered and helpless, in the
Governor's chair. From the first tap of the gong it was nip and tuck
between the executive and the legislative bodies to see which could gain
the advantage, which could he first to pluck the plum of patronage, or
attain the chief seat at the table of publicity."
The Daily presents this paragraph portfolio of figures of speech as
one who rejoices at finding a treasure chest of blossoms and offers it as
a cornucopia of gems for the nourishment of those venturing with
kitten-like wings on the great sea of literary endeavor.
