HOLD YOUR MAN—Stanford Theatre.
A good all-around show. Clark Gable
and Jean Harlow are featured in a pic
ture that gives them a better oppor
tunity to portray their usual types than
was afforded them in "Red Dust," the
last picture in which these two played
together. The plot of "Hold Your Man"
has to do with gyp-rackets, manslaugh
ter, jails, reformatories, penitentiaries,
all woven together with lots of love.
The background is excellent for the
wisecracks with which Gable and Har
low constantly are amusing the audi
ence; the only disheartening thing of
the picture being the beating, morally
and mentally, that Stu Erwin takes. If
you can imagine an up-and-coming
small-town lad who is so in love with
Miss Harlow that he wants to marry
her even after she is going to have a
child by the guy that picks him for a
sucker, and who offers this same slick
and sly Gable a job in his laundry
after Gable returns from the big time
at Sing-Sing, you have a good idea of
the role Stu Erwin plays in this fast
moving picture.
A take-off on Mae West is the com
edy offering, and is fair, and if you are
a golfer, one of Bobby Jones' new series
on "How to Break Ninety" will prove
interesting.
DOUBLE BILL—At Varsity Theatre.
"Gambling Ship"—
Despite a trashy plot, clever dialogue
and quaint situations make this an en
tertaining picture.
Our hero is Cary Grant as a Chicago
thug. Bored with wickedness, he quits
his haunts and goes west for a vacation.
En route he meets dignified Benita
Hume. His great gangster heart swell
ing with love, he gives her a wrong
name.
But dainty Miss Hume, while she is a
very sweet child, is also a hostess on
a gambling ship and a bit of a mistress
to the owner. She adores Grant; so she
gives him a wrong name.
This beautiful incognito romance is
interrupted by fate. Jack La Rue who
(unlike Grant) is a bad gangster, em
ploys divers nasty means to destroy
the "good will" of Miss Hume's boss's
gambling ship and plots to kill Grant.
How he is foiled and he and his gang
maltreated and drowned by Grant, in
a spirit of clean retaliation, is only
part of the remaining story.
The closing shot finds Grant and Miss
Hume happily married, like all good
and honest citizens.
"Hold Me Tight"—
If you like James Dunn and Sally
Eilers, you'll surely enjoy this.
Dunn is a bustling clerk in the ship
ping department of a large store. He
makes continual playful excursions to
the third floor where Sally sells
dresses.
Kenneth Thomson is a crook who
has wormed his way into the confi
dence of the management as a floor
detective. He has a yen for Sally.
Piqued at her rebuffs, he has Dunn
fired on the eve of the couple's wed- j
ding.
There follows Dunn's bitter struggle
to get work. His pride rebelling at the
thought of being supported by a wo
man, he leaves his bride.
Thomson connives to use Sally and
Dunn as his alibi in robbing the store.
This proves his undoing. The end finds
our lovers reunited and securely em
ployed by the grateful monagement.
There is some sadness and a wealth
of comedy in the story. Frank McHugh
is good as an indolent spouse of a
hardworking sales-pal of Sally. It is
one of Dunn's best efforts.

Piqued at her rebuffs, he has Dunn
fired on the eve of the couple's wed- j
ding.
There follows Dunn's bitter struggle
to get work. His pride rebelling at the
thought of being supported by a wo
man, he leaves his bride.
Thomson connives to use Sally and
Dunn as his alibi in robbing the store.
This proves his undoing. The end finds
our lovers reunited and securely em
ployed by the grateful monagement.
There is some sadness and a wealth
of comedy in the story. Frank McHugh
is good as an indolent spouse of a
hardworking sales-pal of Sally. It is
one of Dunn's best efforts.

HOLD YOUR MAN—Stanford Theatre.
A good all-around show. Clark Gable
and Jean Harlow are featured in a pic
ture that gives them a better oppor
tunity to portray their usual types than
was afforded them in "Red Dust," the
last picture in which these two played
together. The plot of "Hold Your Man"
has to do with gyp-rackets, manslaugh
ter, jails, reformatories, penitentiaries,
all woven together with lots of love.
The background is excellent for the
wisecracks with which Gable and Har
low constantly are amusing the audi
ence; the only disheartening thing of
the picture being the beating, morally
and mentally, that Stu Erwin takes. If
you can imagine an up-and-coming
small-town lad who is so in love with
Miss Harlow that he wants to marry
her even after she is going to have a
child by the guy that picks him for a
sucker, and who offers this same slick
and sly Gable a job in his laundry
after Gable returns from the big time
at Sing-Sing, you have a good idea of
the role Stu Erwin plays in this fast
moving picture.
A take-off on Mae West is the com
edy offering, and is fair, and if you are
a golfer, one of Bobby Jones' new series
on "How to Break Ninety" will prove
interesting.
DOUBLE BILL—At Varsity Theatre.
"Gambling Ship"—
Despite a trashy plot, clever dialogue
and quaint situations make this an en
tertaining picture.
Our hero is Cary Grant as a Chicago
thug. Bored with wickedness, he quits
his haunts and goes west for a vacation.
En route he meets dignified Benita
Hume. His great gangster heart swell
ing with love, he gives her a wrong
name.
But dainty Miss Hume, while she is a
very sweet child, is also a hostess on
a gambling ship and a bit of a mistress
to the owner. She adores Grant; so she
gives him a wrong name.
This beautiful incognito romance is
interrupted by fate. Jack La Rue who
(unlike Grant) is a bad gangster, em
ploys divers nasty means to destroy
the "good will" of Miss Hume's boss's
gambling ship and plots to kill Grant.
How he is foiled and he and his gang
maltreated and drowned by Grant, in
a spirit of clean retaliation, is only
part of the remaining story.
The closing shot finds Grant and Miss
Hume happily married, like all good
and honest citizens.
"Hold Me Tight"—
If you like James Dunn and Sally
Eilers, you'll surely enjoy this.
Dunn is a bustling clerk in the ship
ping department of a large store. He
makes continual playful excursions to
the third floor where Sally sells
dresses.
Kenneth Thomson is a crook who
has wormed his way into the confi
dence of the management as a floor
detective. He has a yen for Sally.
Piqued at her rebuffs, he has Dunn
fired on the eve of the couple's wed- j
