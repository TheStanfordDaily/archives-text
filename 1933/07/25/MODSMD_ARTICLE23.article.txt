Joe Coughlin, Stanford tennis player,
teamed up with Henry Culley to win
the men's doubles in the invitational
tennis tournament of the Crescent Ath
letic-Hamilton Club by defeating Frank
Shields and Eugene McCauliff, 3-6,
13-11, 4-6, 6-4, 6-1. However, Cough
lin received a setback in the singles
when McCauliff trounced him 6-3, 8-6.
When football season opens at Santa
Barbara State Teachers College this
fall, Ted Shipkey, former Stanford ath
lete, will direct the players, for he was
recently appointed head coach. Shipkey
comes to the southern city after having
been head coach at Tempe State Teach
ers College in Arizona.
Stanford Tennis Captain-elect Charles
Otis was eliminated from the La Jolla
invitational tennis tournament last
week-end wheh he was downed by
Dolph Meuhleisen of San Diego, 6-2,
6-4, in a semi-final game.
Two appointments to the football
coaching staff of the University of Cali
fornia are expected to be made shortly.
They will be Sammy Gill, the fighting
guard of the '32 varsity, and Joe Smith,
quarterback. These men will assist with
the freshman squads.
Two firsts, a second, and a seventh
place was the record of husky weight
man Here Laborde of Stanford, com
peting for the A.A.U. in international
track meets held in Sweden. Laborde
took top honors in his favorite event,
the discus throw, in a meet held in
Stockholm, then competing in the little
city of Sundsvall, Laborde again won
his event. In the former meet the Card
weight man threw the platter 158 feet
8 99-128 inches, while he threw less
than 150 feet at Sundsvall. In an ex
hibition held in Stockholm, Laborde
took a third to Anderson of U.S.A.,
who threw the discus 157 feet IV2
inches. Woefully weak was the attempt
of Laborde in the shot put, when the
Indian weight man could not heave the
shot beyond the 44-foot 9 3-16 inch
mark to take a seventh place. The
American team, competing against ath
letes of ten other nations, has been
winning with ease.
Providing enough sign up for the
event, a women's handicap singles ten
nis tournament will be held August 1.
Posters will be placed both in the
Union and in Madrono Hall and those
wishing to enter the tournament should
sign there. All registered women stu
dents are eligible.
That today is the last opportunity stu
dents will have to enter the summer
session tennis tournament was an
nounced by Myron R. Schall, instructor
in physical education. The drawings for
this match, open only to registered
summer quarter students, will take
place tomorrow, and the games will get
under way Thursday.
