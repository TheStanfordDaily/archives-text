## 
### 
With nineteenth century painters as
his subject, Professor A. B. Clark gave
the next to last lecture of his series on
art appreciation Thursday.
The three schools of art of the nine
teenth century were discussed, begin
ning with the classicist revolt from the
romanticism of the pre-revolutionary
days, and going on to the more import
ant realist and impressionist schools
which dominated the latter part of the
century.
The classic school was best repre
sented by David, who was an excellent
artist for such a change, because of his
mastery of contour, especially neces
sary with classical subjects. However,
this classic school did not last long be
fore De la Croix became prominent
with his return to romantic subjects as
before the revolution.
Professor Clark next considered the
famous Millet, painter of "The An
gelus" and "The Gleaners," whose work
with landscapes and use of peasant
subjects was outstanding. With him was
considered Corot, a pupil of Millet and
in some respects his superior. Then
the lecturer went to Daumier, Courvet,
and the little appreciated Manet, whose
manipulation of paint and color rela
tionships were characterized as superb.
With Manet came the famous school
of impressionists which included such
greats as Monet, who first painted the
out-of-doors to look as we really see
it, Dregat, Sourat, Renoir, and Cezan,
greatest of the impressionists, with his
exquisite use of the mosaid effect in
oils. Cezan, Professor Clark said, was
the greatest artist of all these in that
he subdued the literal to the artistic
soul to obtain the heights of artistic
feeling.
