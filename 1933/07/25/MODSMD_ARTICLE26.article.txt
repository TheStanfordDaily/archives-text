MOIESE, Mont.—An albino buffalo,
so rare a creature that white men are
not believed to have seen more than
10 of its kind, was born on the national
bison range near Moiese this season.
White buffalo were extremely rare
even when millions of the shaggy ani
mals roamed western plains. Indians
considered them "big medicine," and
would pay a price of 10 to 15 horses for
a good albino skin. After three or four
years the natives would offer the skin
as a sacrifice to the wind and rain.
Dr. W. T. Hornaday, famed scientist,
estimates that no albino buffalo ever
reached maturity, so highly did hunters
and Indians prize the skins.
