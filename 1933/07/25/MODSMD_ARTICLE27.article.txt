# OBERLIN OBSERVES CENTENARY
## 
### 
Oberlin College, the birthplace of co
education, celebrated its hundredth
birthday in June. When colleges
in this country admitted men only
and largely discriminated against
Negroes, Oberlin opened its hand-hewn
doors in the midst of the Ohio wilder
ness to all alike, without distinction as
to sex, color or class.
