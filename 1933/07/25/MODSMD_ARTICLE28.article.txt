# Dr. Brown In Interview On Journalist William A. White
## 
### 
"William Allen White is a very lov
able character," declared Edwin J.
Brown, acting professor of education,
in an interview on the famous Kansas
newspaper man.
White edits his paper in Emporia
where Professor Brown is a member
of the faculty of Kansas State Teachevs
College. The two men are personal
muYa hassecon, :gUw(JphYnelu. dster 45
friends and Professor Brown is well
qualified to discuss this colorful figure
of American life.
"While most people know William
Allen White for his editorials he is also
an author and biographer of note,"
Professor Brown said. "His home, situ
ated in the center of the nation, is a
stopping-off place for literary people
on their way across the continent."
"Upon reaching his sixty-fifth birth
day, White wrote one of his most fa
mous editorials, which was copied on
the front page of practically every
metropolitan daily in the United
States. White and his son, who holds

a master's degree from Yale write
every word on the editorial page of the
Emporia Gazette.
"Although Emporia is a town the size
of Palo Alto, White's paper has a tre
mendous influence and is ranked by
many as the best small-town news
paper in the country.
"The man, himself, is very interest
ing. He prides himself in knowing
everyone in town, and, although he is
a national figure," Professor Brown
said, "Mr. White has time to see any
one who comes to his office."
Professor Brown declared that al
though many people ask White his
opinion on authors and books, he never
says anything biting or cruel about
literary effort, and it is necessary for
one to listen for the volume of praise
in order to get what he really thinks of
the book or author under discussion.
Professor Brown is spending his sec
ond summer at Stanford as a member
of the faculty after taking his Ph.D.
here some years ago.
