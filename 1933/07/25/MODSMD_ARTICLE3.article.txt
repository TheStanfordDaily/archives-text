# Amnesia Afflicts Student; Almost Forgets His Name
## 
### 
A card, hung in a glass box at
the campus postoffice, tells the
tale of the woeful way Ward writes
home.
Some time ago Ward wrote a
letter which mysteriously slipped
away from him. Not in the least
dismayed, Ward sat himself down
and penned the aforementioned
card which reads in part:
Dear Mother:
"Wrote you a letter and lost
it before it was mailed. The
laundry arrived okeh."
Now if Ward will walk up to
the postoffice and put an address
on this card, Postmaster W. C.
Werry says he will send it to
Ward's mother so that she may
know Ward wrote, but lost the
letterâ€”and failed to address the
card telling her what happened
to the letter.
