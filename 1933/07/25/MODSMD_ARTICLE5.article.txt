# At The Toyon Dance
## 
### 
Sam Lowry's band syncopating blues
songs—
Joan Jankowsky very feminine —her
many male admirers—
Grant Sheidler and the beauteous girl
in gingham—
Wee Willie Carter resplendent in gray
and silver cut quite a striking figure—
That strange creature who chose a
corner among the baggage in search of
a bit of repose—
Blind dates that did not harmonize—
Dainty Alpha Christensen with the
tall Bob Jankins—
Vivacious Florence Waddel dancing
with the tall and silent athlete —
Miss Doyle in the lobby—
Lucille Salter and Ted Lynn—
The Union "45" turned out in full
quota—
A1 Fast behind the punch bowl—
That line of stags at a late hour—Bill
Barks, Keith Topping, Don Cameron,
James DeLamater, Bud Fisher—
Virginia Radcliffe all in white—
