The second concert of the Pro Arte
Sti'ing Quartet will be given at 3:30
o'clock tomorrow afternoon in the dance
studio of the Women's Gymnasium. This
concert is made possible through the
generosity of Mrs. Elizabeth Sprague
Coolidge and is free to members of the
faculty and students.
Admission will be by ticket only and
there are no reserved seats. Students
and faculty may obtain tickets at the
office of the Director of the Summer
Quarter in the Administration Building.
Already seats up to the capacity of the
main floor have been given out.
The concert, composed entirely of se
lections from Brahms, is divided into
three parts, as follows:
1. Quartet in C Minor, Opus 51, Num
ber 1. 2. Quintet in G Major, Opus 111,
Number 2 (for two violins, two violas,
and violoncello). 3. Quartet in A Minor,
Opus 51, Number 2.
The Pro Arte Quartet is the official
quartet of the Belgian court. Its mem
bers have spent the last three years on
world tours, playing in London, Rome,
and Washington, D.C., where they were
officially received at the White House.
For this concert Nathan Firestone,
who is well known locally, will assist
the quartet in the second number.
