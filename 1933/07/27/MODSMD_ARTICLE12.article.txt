# Hadzsits Talks About Virgil
## 
### 
"Virgil and His Italy" was the title
of George D. Hadzsits' lecture given
yesterday afternoon in the Little Thea
tre. Virgil's deep devotion to Italy and
all of her natural charms was shown
very clearly in all of his works.
Virgil showed a thorough and sym
pathetic knowledge of the plants, trees,
flowers, mountains, rivers, and lakes of
his beloved country. This especially
was brought out in the Aeneid. Here
Virgil explains that he considers the
beauty of Italy to be unsurpassed in
the entire world.
Lover and Poet
"He looked upon Italy with the eyes
of a lover and a poet, and gave death
less knowledge of his affection," de
clared Professor Hadzsits. We see this
same spirit of appreciation of Italy in
all the works of Virgil, and it forms a
constant background for his poetry.
"Rome, as the invisible symbol of the
grace and power of Italy, was en
shrined in his heart; and Virgil, as
completely as any poet since his day,
caught the charm of Italy. His poetic
conception is as true today as it was
two thousand years ago," stated Pro
fessor Hadzsits.
Poet of Nature
Virgil was first of all a poet of na
ture but he was always a lover of the
charms of Italy. Although he traveled
all over the world, he never found any
scenic wonders to compare with his
homeland.
"No one, today, can afford to remain
in ignorance of a poet who is as im
mortal as Dante, Shakespeare, or
Goethe," Professor Hadzsits declared
in closing his talk.
Acting Professor Hadzsits is professor
of Latin at the University of Pennsyl
vania. His special field is Roman re
ligion, also the Roman poet, Lucretius.
He is finishing books on both of these
subjects. He is a member of the faculty
this summer in the Department of
Classical Literature.
