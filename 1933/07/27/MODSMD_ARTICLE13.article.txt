# Palo Alto Intersection To Copy Farm Traffic Island
## 
### 
The final step in the beautification of
the intersection at Palm Drive and the
state highway is under way. A traffic
island similar to the one already in
position at the Stanford entrance is
being constructed on the Palo Alto side
of the intersection.
Workmen have moved the oil station
on the northeast corner to a lot some
what east of its old position, and are
now in the process of shaving the cor
ner down to an angle that will make
navigation of the intersection more con
venient. The "island" will not only add
much to the attractiveness of the Stan
ford entrance, but will also aid in the
handling of traffic, especially at the
time of the Big Game.
