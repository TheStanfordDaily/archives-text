# No Charge For "45" At Dance, Men Must Pay
## 
### 
"Ten cents a dance" is no longer the
slogan applicable to jolly-ups spon
sored by the Union Club. At the dance
to be held from 7 to 8 o'clock tomorrow
evening in the Women's Clubhouse,
any man wishing to dance with the
celebrated "45" will have to pay 15
cents. Couples will not be admitted
free, although women will not be
charged.
The music of Canfield's Gardens or
chestra, which played at the last jolly
up, should somewhat soften the blow
of the additional 5 cents, which is being
used to pay for the rent of the hall as
well as the orchestra. The raise in
price is due to the fact that no financial
aid will be extended to this affair, as
to the last.

Justine Jankowsky, president of the
Associated Women Students, announces
that unless a large crowd attends ex
penses can not be met and further
jolly-ups will be impossible.
