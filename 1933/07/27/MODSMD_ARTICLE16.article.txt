# TO HOLD AT HOME
## 
### 
The At Home sponsored by Pi
Lambda Theta will be held today from
4 to 6 o'clock in the Stanford Women's
Club. All women faculty members and
students are invited to attend. Because
of this gathering, the regular Thursday
afternoon tea held by the Union Club
has been postponed.

There will be a German Table in the
Union Cafeteria at noon today.
