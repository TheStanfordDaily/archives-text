Harold Chapman Brown, professor of philosophy, contributes the
current "Students of Mine" interview. Professor Brown graduated from
Williams College in 1901, and received his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees at
Harvard. He also studied at the University of Berlin.
Professor Brown's first positions after getting his doctor's degree
were at Harvard and Columbia, where he taught until 1914. Since then
he has been at Stanford, altohugh he has taught intersession courses at
California, Washington, and Columbia, and during 1928-1929 and 1930-
1931 was visiting professor at the University of Texas.
There are generally two types of professors of philosophy: the clear
minded, yet rather limited, elucidator of the most elementary principles,
and the brilliant though generally rather difficult-to-understand propo
gator of advanced theories. Both types are satisfactory in their narrow
compass. It is to the highest credit of Professor Brown that he is able to
combine the good qualities of these two types of teachers. His sub
freshmen, who think Descartes is the plural for a map, are able to under
stand Professor Brown's lectures just as well as his best student working
for a Ph.D. degree.
Professor Brown's favorite courses among students are the general
surveys of Logics, Ethics, and Introduction to Philosophy.
