# AGAIN THE "45" ENTERTAINS
## 
### 
Tomorow night the Union Club is sponsoring another all-University
jolly-up in the Women's Clubhouse.
Everyone who went to the first dance agreed that it was a success.
The "45" secured the Canfield's Gardens orchestra —its first appearance
on the campus—and the orchestra itself appeared to be a success. Good
music and the low price gave everyone the chance to make new friends.
This is their second jolly-up. The Union Club has the same orchestra
to insure a pleasant evening of dancing. The price, however, must be
increased a nickel—and applied to all men, regardless of whether they
bring dates, in order to meet the added expense of renting the clubhouse.
They received outside financial aid with the first jolly-up.
The sucecss of this dance will insure several others during the rest of
the quarter.
