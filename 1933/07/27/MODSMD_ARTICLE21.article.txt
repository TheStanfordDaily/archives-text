# A 						BREATHING SPELL
## 
### 
There are a few summer students who are so intent on acquiring edu
cation that they are neglecting any form of recreation.
One of these students was recently heard to explain apologetically
that he had taken a week-end off for a trip when he "really couldn't afford
the time."
Stanford, in the summer, is a place to enjoy a share of recreation.
The campus is so located that trips to the redwoods, the mountains, the
beaches, and San Francisco are convenient. Students should not bury
themselves in their work without at least one respite. No course is so
planned as to prevent some slight time off for a breathing spell.
There is such a thing as over-doing. That applies to studies as well
as anything) else. After all, health is an important element of life and
health may be impaired by too much work with no play.
Teachers who have entered the Stanford summer quarter, coming
directly from their various schools and having to return to those schools
immediately after Stanford closes, without any more vacation than the
drive to and from the campus, may be over-doing. Too much study
without a breathing spell occasionally will tend to make one "go stale."
One Sunday off every two or three weesk certainly would not greatly
infringe on the amount of education gained during the quarter â€”but it
would provide a refreshed mind with which to tackle the problems of
education with a new vigor.
