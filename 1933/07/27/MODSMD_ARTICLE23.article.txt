WHEN LADIES MEET—At Stanford
Theatre.
When you see Robert Montgomery's
name in the headilights you are assured
of grimaces and plaguing tricks. But
Montgomery plays a very hectic trick
when he brings together two women
who adore the same man. One woman
is Ann Hajding, the harried wife; the
other lady is Myrna Loy, hopeful lover.
The prize these attractive women de
sire is Frank Morgan, who is only a
trifle less suave than he is irresponsible.
The manner in which this situation is
treated results in a film of marked
sophistication and charm.
Ann Harding has her usual restraint
and dignity of expression, while Myrna
Loy appears in an unusually sympa
thetic role which permits her far more
sweetness than is her regular lot.
Robert Montgomery is the constant
chap who woos Miss Loy. He has a
pranking good time doing so, being his
delightfully) indelicate self.
Alice Brady appears as a babbling
widow in whose home the principal
entanglements take place. A bit less of
her nervous witlessness would have
been better.
An hysterical French chef who is in
constant vocal rebellion against his

tasks is the comedy hit of the produc
tion.
There is a very mediocre Thelma
Todd-Zasu Pitts comedy which drags
along only to arrive at a limp ending.
BEDTIME STORY and LIFE OF
JIMMY DOLAN—At the Varsity
Theatre. k
"Bedtime Story"—Baby Leroy steals
the show from Maurice Chevalier;
Helen Twelvetrees helps a lot, and Ed
ward Everett Horton keeps the comedy
going. The picture contains enough en
tertainment to make it worth seeing
again, for this present showing is its
second in Palo Alto.
"Life of Jimmy Dolan"—Not inter
esting ... we could hardly sit through
it . . . too artificial . . . way below
Douglas Fairbanks Jr.'s par . . . Lor
etta Young not even pretty here . . .
"Screwy" Philaxer (Guy Kibbee) is
really "screwy" .. . Alice McMahon,
even she is pretty sad, and not because
the mortgage on her farm comes due

must bong this mistake of the moving
shadows.

esting ... we could hardly sit through
it . . . too artificial . . . way below
Douglas Fairbanks Jr.'s par . . . Lor
etta Young not even pretty here . . .
"Screwy" Philaxer (Guy Kibbee) is
really "screwy" .. . Alice McMahon,
even she is pretty sad, and not because
the mortgage on her farm comes due
. .. we never could understand the why
in making Doug Jr. a box-fighter . . .
his hair doesn't muss properly . . .
and ad infinitum ... all together, we
must bong this mistake of the moving
shadows.
