Drawings for the summer session ten
nis tournament were posted yesterday
on the bulletin board in the men's
gymnasium, and play in this contest
starts today. A much larger field than
expected signed up for the match, with
every player having a fair chance of
winning the title because of the few
outstanding court men attending school
this quarter.

Members of the Board of Supervisors
of San Francisco passed a resolution to
contribute $1000 toward the expense of
sending the South End Rowing Club's
four-oared crew, Pacific Coast cham
pions, to the national championships in
Chicago early next month. The mem
bers of the "four" are all former Bear
oarsmen who rowed in the California
"eight" that won in the Olympics.

Less than two months from Saturday,
Stanford's football team will open its
1933 schedule, meeting "Dud" DeGroot's
San Jose State squad. No "push over"
will this game be, for the Spartans
have nearly the same team that brought
the Far Western championship to San
Jose last year.
Unplaced went Stanford weight man
Here Laborde, competing for the A.A.U.
in a track meet against Swedish ath
letes at Vasteras, Sweden. A newcomer
in discus ranks, A. Hedvall, of Sweden,
took the event with a throw of 155 feet
27-64 inches, followed by the Swedish
champion, T. Anderson, with the Amer
ican, John Anderson, in third place.

John Doeg, former Stanford tennis
player, and one-time national cham
pion, defeated Karl Kamrath, husky
Texan, 7-5, 6-4, to reach the quarter
finals of the forty-sixth annual Sea
bright Cricket and Tennis Club tourna
ment now being held at New Jersey.
