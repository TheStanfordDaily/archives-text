THE DOGDAYS
hie in reducta valle Caniculae
vitabis aestus . . .
The morning changes in the sun
As though the hush were insecure,
And love that piteously begun
Could never in the moon endure,
The noon of unachieved intent,
Grown hazy with unshadowed light,
Where changing is subservient
To hope no longer nor delight.
Now none alive will stir for hours,
Compassion will leave love unsaid,
While through the window masked with flowers
A lone wasp staggers from the dead.
Watch now, bereft of coming days
The wasp in the darkened chamber fly,
Whirring ever in an airy maze,
Lost in the light he entered by.
