# Novice And Senior Diving Scheduled For Tomorrow
## 
### 
Diving is scheduled at 4:20 o'clock
tomorrow afternoon in the Encina pool
for both senior and novice swimmers
when the third event of the swimming
pentathlon gets under way. Competi
tors in both classes will have to per
form three required dives from the
low board.
Although James DeLamater is lead
ing the senior group and Bob Jenkins
is leading in the novice division, com
petition is close with all swimmers hav
ing a chance to win the pentathlon.
Due to the fact there is no outstanding
diver attending Stanford this summer,
the field should be wide open.
