## 
### 
The University of California an
nounced yesterday consolidation of the
University Printing Office and Univer
sity Press with increased activities, in
an effort to place its books in both
public and private libraries, and to
make operations more profitable.
Samuel T. Farquhar has been made
superintendent; Wilder Bentley, sales
manager; and Harold A. Small, editor.
Farquhar came to the institution about
a year ago as University printer. Bent
ley holds degrees from Yale and Michi
gan, and has been on the faculties of
the latter, the University of Oklahoma,
and Carnegie Institute of Technology.
Small is a graduate of Colby College,
Maine. He has served as literary editor
of the San Francisco Chronicle and the
Argonaut, and has given extension
courses at the University of California.

The Students of Columbia Univer
sity fear that with the erection of a new
library their intramural field will be
ruined.
