# Yvor Winters, Don Stanford Publish In "Hound And Horn"
## 
### 
The summer issue of that distin
guished quarterly, the "Hound and
Horn," has arrived, and contains poetry
and criticism by two Stanford authors,
Yvor Winters, instructor in the Eng
lish department, and Don Stanford,
senior class poet.

"Theseus," a blank verse poem, is
probably Mr. Winters' finest published
verse. It is in three parts, and is a broad
summary of the Theseus legend. The
Ariadne portion is not emphasized.
The metrical scheme of "Theseus" is
intricate and subtle; the diction is dis
tinguished and moving. Although some
of the best poetry of the last deoade is
included in Mr. Winters' three vol
umes, "Bare Hills" (1927), "The Proof"
1929), and "The Journey" (1931), this
latest performance represents an even
further development.

Mr. Winters also contributes an essay
on "Sixteenth Century Lyrics"—sound,
profound criticism. It is a very fine
analysis of a period which particularly
interests the critic.

These two performances indicate that
Mr. Winters is about to step into the
first rank of American poets, as well
as cement his already established criti
cal reputation. Many scholars consider
him absolutely foremost in the field of
criticism of poetry.

The other Stanford author is Don
Stanford, senior class poet, who con
tributes three blank verse poems in the
grand style, "For Hate," "For The Audi
ence," and "Reflections on Fear." Mr.
Stanford has done much better than
these three pieces, which are the ear
liest poems he has preserved. His "Son
net on Graduation," the senior class
poem, is an extremely fine piece.

Two other oustanding features make
this issue of unusual significance. The
famous poet, Allen Tate, presents his
first published story, "The Immortal

Woman." R. P. Blackmur, whose "'Sea
Island Miscellany" and portfolio of
American poets have received 'com
mendation on both sides of the Atlantic,
contributes another scholarly essay, on
Samuel Butler, the Victorian novelist.
There is also an amusing essay by Fred
T. Marsh, and reproductions of paint
ings by Winslow Homer. There are
other important chronicles and reviews.

During the few years that it has
been published, the "Hound and Horn"
has perhaps printed more distinguished
writing than any other American
magazine. It is rivalled in this respect
by few European periodicals. And this
latest issue is one of its very best.

"Theseus," a blank verse poem, is
probably Mr. Winters' finest published
verse. It is in three parts, and is a broad
summary of the Theseus legend. The
Ariadne portion is not emphasized.
The metrical scheme of "Theseus" is
intricate and subtle; the diction is dis
tinguished and moving. Although some
of the best poetry of the last deoade is
included in Mr. Winters' three vol
umes, "Bare Hills" (1927), "The Proof"
1929), and "The Journey" (1931), this
latest performance represents an even
further development.

Mr. Winters also contributes an essay
on "Sixteenth Century Lyrics"—sound,
profound criticism. It is a very fine
analysis of a period which particularly
interests the critic.

These two performances indicate that
Mr. Winters is about to step into the
first rank of American poets, as well
as cement his already established criti
cal reputation. Many scholars consider
him absolutely foremost in the field of
criticism of poetry.

The other Stanford author is Don
Stanford, senior class poet, who con
tributes three blank verse poems in the
grand style, "For Hate," "For The Audi
ence," and "Reflections on Fear." Mr.
Stanford has done much better than
these three pieces, which are the ear
liest poems he has preserved. His "Son
net on Graduation," the senior class
poem, is an extremely fine piece.

Two other oustanding features make
this issue of unusual significance. The
famous poet, Allen Tate, presents his
first published story, "The Immortal

Woman." R. P. Blackmur, whose "'Sea
Island Miscellany" and portfolio of
American poets have received 'com
mendation on both sides of the Atlantic,
contributes another scholarly essay, on
Samuel Butler, the Victorian novelist.
There is also an amusing essay by Fred
T. Marsh, and reproductions of paint
ings by Winslow Homer. There are
other important chronicles and reviews.

During the few years that it has
been published, the "Hound and Horn"
has perhaps printed more distinguished
writing than any other American
magazine. It is rivalled in this respect
by few European periodicals. And this
latest issue is one of its very best.
