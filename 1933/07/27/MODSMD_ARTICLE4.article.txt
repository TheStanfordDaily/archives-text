# Toyon Teachers Chant Carols At Union Unch-lay
## 
### 
When good fellows get together on
each Wednesday noon in the Union
dining hall it's time to sing "Sweet
Adeline" again.
The enthusiasm with which the men
of the School of Education are striking
up the songs of a few years ago would
indicate that Toyon shower rooms must
be the scene of not a little practicing.
Diners outside the teachers' group
are separated from the songsters only
by a screen. This audience has been
quick to identify some of the voices,
particularly that of the "lone baritone,"
as belonging to the "Beverly Hill Bil
lies."
Though this suspicion has not been
verified, such talent merits professional
rating.
