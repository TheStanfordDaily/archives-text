# Postmaster Hews Destiny Of Ward --"Letter Writer"
## 
### 
"There is a destiny that shapes
our ends, rough hew them how
we may," for Ward's letter, de
spite the author's indifferent han
dling of it, was duly received and
acknowledged by his mother. If
you're dubious about the prover
bial Providence that watches over
fools, drunks, and . . . well, yes,
Stanford students, you can accept
the more logical explanation that
some kind soul found the letter
and dropped it in a nearby post
box.

Anyway, Ward appeared at the
postoffice yesterday to tell Post
master Werry it was no longer
necessary to send the card telling
his mother he wrote, but lost the
letter, and forgot to address the
card announcing the loss of the
letter, because someone else found
the letter and sent it on its way,
all of which begins to sound like a
Stanford saga resembling the cat
that ate the rat that lived in the
house that Jack built.
