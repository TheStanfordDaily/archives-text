Professor Emeritus A. B. Clark will
give the concluding lecture of his series
on Art Appreciation at 8 o'clock this
evening in the Little Theatre. His sub
ject is to be "Contemporary Moderns
in Art."

In this last lecture, Professor Clark
will consider the Neo-classicist school
of modern artists who, although they
show no distinct break from the Im
pressionists of the last century, are
quite different from that group. Also he
will consider the Cubists, or more
properly the Futurist school which
caused such a stir a few years ago
among critics. These artists believe it
is not art to paint a scene just as it is
presented to the eye, but that it should
rather be painted according to the feel
ings of the artist at the time he is
working. Thus, just as a musician might
play with the notes of a piano, so the
artist may extend a particular plane to
show how it would look if thus ex
tended in nature. This often confuses
the amateur critic, but to the one who
understands what the artist is trying
to do the picture has much meaning.

Professor Clark will also consider the
underlying movement which led to the
Neo-classical school as is is now and
to the Futurist movement, which is still
developing.
