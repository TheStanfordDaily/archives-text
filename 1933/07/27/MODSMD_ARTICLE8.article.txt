### 
Telling of the two racial problems in
South Africa and the troubles they
cause, Dr. A. J. Barnouw, Queen Wil
helmina professor of Dutch language
and literature at Columbia University,
now acting professor at the University
of California, lectured Tuesday on
"Race and Language Problems in South
Africa."
The first problem he treated was that
of the Dutch, or Boers, and their ani
mosity toward the British. This feeling
has remained from the days of the
Board war which ended in 1902 and
in which the British completed the ag
gressive movement of following the
Dutch settlers as they made new homes
to the north of the British Cape Settle

Blacks a Problem
This racial friction is something which
few people know of, and the extent of
which few people realize. It has been
only recently that the two opposing
forces have been able to effect a recon
ciliation and that has come only be
cause of the economic stress necessi

Cape Colonies.
The need is great for co-operation in
meeting the other x-acial problem of the
territory: the problem of the Blacks.

into the cities to seek work. The Negro
will work for much less than will the
white worker.
Sees No Near Solution
There are no labor laws protecting
the Blacks, therefore they are displac

jobs and a large population of Poor

Is aggravated by the fact that the great
majority of the Whites fail to recog
nize the problem as such.
Dr. Barnouw fails to see a near so
lution of the Negro-White problem.
However, about the Dutch-British prob
lem he was optimistic, saying that as
soon as the problem of the different
languages is cleared, the animosity,
which has rested largely on the per
sonal hatred of some of the leaders,
would disappear.
