# Pro Arte Group Win Plaudits In Return Concert
## Recital Presented by Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge, Noted Music Lover Audience Likes Programs Of Brahms Music 
### 
The program by the Pro Arte String
Quartet of Brussels in the Women's
Gymnasium Friday afternoon was in
honor of the centenary of the birth of
Brahms.
Appearing through the generous
patronage of Mrs. Elizabeth Sprague
Coolidge, the Quartet played the Quar
tet in A Minor, the Quintet in G Major,
and the C Minor Quartet. The music
might very well have been oppressive
had not the musicians been supremely
competent and the audience in a rarely
attentive mood.
The precision and unity which the
members of the quartet, Alphonse On
now, Laurent Halleaux, Germain Pre
vost, and Robert Mass, have attained
in their long career together is all the
more remarkable because of the indi
vidual virtuosity of each player. That
they have sought to sublimate their
own separate personalities in the con
summate perfection of ensemble is a
monument to devoted practice and
study.
In the quartet music of Brahms,
where the composer has denied himself
the sonority and opulence of a sym
phony, and confined his genius to four
perfectly balanced instruments, the no
bility of theme and intensity of emo
tion are revealed with satisfying force.
Even when supplemented with another
instrument in the quintet, the viola of
Nathan Firestone, who fitted into the
organization with great skill, the mes
sage of Brahms' music is one of form
and melody, the progression of theme
and development, and the paramount
importance of harmonic structure.
This symphonic music, generally mis
understood because of its "thickness,"
is burdened perhaps by its own com
plexity. The quartets have no such dis
advantage. Lyric passages of inspired
beauty, rugged peasant motives, and
sober, moving litanies, are displayed
for their own sakes.
Perhaps the most perfect playing was
attained in the adagio of the quintet
and the allegro and romanze of the
C Minor Quartet.
