# Stags Entranced; Find Females At Jolly-Up Dance
## 
### 
And a goodly crowd was there! Fri
day night's jolly-up proved more pleas
urable than the affair held some three
weeks ago.
The outstanding feature of the dance
seemed to be a larger number of wo
men than at the first jolly-upâ€”in other
words, the stags had a bigger variety
from which to choose their partners
and the girls were able to dance a few
more yards to the music of the Can
field's Gardens orchestra without being
cut.
Student opinion places another
feather in the Associated Women's
beret and also applauds Justine Jan
kowsky for their efforts in making the
party a success.
