"To those who love God all things
work together for good." This Biblical
phrase formed the subject of the ser
mon delivered Sunday by the Reverend
Leslie E. Learned of the All Saints
Church of Pasadena at the Memorial
Church.
Christianity is a splendid contribu
tion toward the courage of the world
because of the element of struggle in
it, stated Dr. Learned.
A faith in religions gives meaning to
everything which is to find a perma
nent strength and a permanent beauty.
Faith gives us two things, according to
Dr. Learned. It affords patience and it
gives a measure of power ,the standard
of power being to carry on.
Winifred Elliott Estabrook, soprano,
and Waldo Furgason, baritone, sang a
