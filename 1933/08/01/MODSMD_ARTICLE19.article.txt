# MARJORIE GULLAN

Many people raise their hands and cover their ears in outraged horror
at the thought of listening to someone read poetry for an hour. This
apprehension is largely the result of a traditional American distaste for
elocution, rather than any intrinsic flaw in the type of entertainment. It
is one of those unfortunate bugs which we have allowed to feed on our
brains, very much like the bugs which have bred a distaste for literature,
works of art, internationalism, and other horrible things.
Marjorie Gillian, one of the most famous readers of poetry in the
world, has succeeded in breaking down this unfortunate animosity at
Berkeley, where she has been giving courses this summer. Very few
students showed up for the first days of the quarter, but after a few
weeks the courses were so popular that auditors were charged 50 cents
to attend. In her public recital in immense Wheeler Hall, many people
were unable to gain admission, so great was the attendance.
Miss Gullan will recite at Stanford tonight. Two reasons indicate
that her concert will be entertaining: the poems selected for reading are
of a type particularly adaptable to reading aloud, and Miss Gullan is a
real artist in her profession.
Nothing can be more boring than a bad poetry reading. Likewise
nothing can be more beautiful than a fine rendition.
