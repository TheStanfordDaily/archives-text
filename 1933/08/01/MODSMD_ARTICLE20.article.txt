# NIRA TAKES EFFECT
## 
### 
Today NIRA begins to function.
The merchants of Palo Alto have announced a new schedule of
business hours to conform to President Roosevelt's plan.
The majority of local business establishments met voluntarily yester
day morning for the purpose of drawing up an agreement whereby they
will respect the hours decided upon. Their action gives evidence of their
willingness to co-operate both with the Administration and with the
people—they should be rewarded with equal co-operation by Campus as
well as Palo Alto residents.
Reorganizing hours on the new schedule will mean, in effect, that
certain employees receiving a certain wage will have one day off in six—
or will be drawing pay for six days, while working only five. This
schedule will also involve the hiring of 20 per cent more help to offset
the shorter hours per employee, hence an increase in operating expenses.
The fact that the NIRA schedule will mean more work and more
leisure, will also bring about an eventual increase in prices. But, until
the plan has had time to get under way, the merchants will need assistance
from the buying public. Our part of the plan is to aid the merchants in
co-operating with the recovery administration —we should patronize
NIRA stores.
