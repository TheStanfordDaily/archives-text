ATAVISM I
My grandsire seven times removed
Was captain of a merchant ship,
And brought the wealth of southern seas
Into Old Newport's weathered slip.
Rare spices filled the bursting hold,
Carved chessmen shaped with cunning tool—
The treasures of the East. .. . He died
The master of the village school.
How could he tame that roving heart
And blind his eager, searching eyes,
Accepting dull prosaic roof
For canopy of star-swept skies?
Two hundred years have passed away
Since last he furled his questing sails;
Yet in my heart I feel a call
That draws me on to face the gales.
Behind a desk with book and bell
I teach my class from nine to three;
And I have never walked a deck I
Nor braved the anger of the sea.
Grim destiny has made my life
What he embraced ... I know not why;
But my cramped spirit strains its wings
When daring sea-gulls circle by.
