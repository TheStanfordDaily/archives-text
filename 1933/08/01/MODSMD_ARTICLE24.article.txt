WHAT PRICE INNOCENCES and MAN
OF THE FOREST—At the Varsity.
"What Price Innocence"—We com
mend this picture for the enterprising
young Hindu's ascetic apprenticeship.
Observing its agonizing refinements, he
will toss on his rack in insufferable
ecstacy.
But there was a man at the Varsity
who lacked the stoic quality. As the
fever of this celluloid nightmare ran
its course he arose in a twitching spasm
and croaked feebly.
It's the story of a 17-year-old "tot"
whose mamma won't tell her why she
has certain indefinable sensations. What
happens to her as a result is nothing
compared to what happens to the
audience.
"Man Of The Forest"—Out of the
great woods rides Randolph Scott. On
his beautiful white steed he whirls
down upon a carriage and snatches
Verna Hill from her seat. He is no
bandit. He is risking precious life to
save the niece of his pal, Harry Carey,
from the trap of scheming Noah Beery.
Noah desires Carey's lands. Momen
tarily frustrated, he murders Carey and
attaches the guilt to Scott.
Ho\V Scott's pet lion accomplishes his
jail break for him and Beery is finally
disposed of makes a fairish story.
Fine scenic shots enhance the pic
ture. Scott's acting is agreeable. Buster
Crabbe appears in a minor role as a
henchman of Beery. —H.H.
MELODY CRUISE and PRIVATE DE
TECTIVE 62—At Stanford Theatre.
"Melody Cruise"—Light comedy . . .
Charles Ruggles grabs the honors for
laugh-producing . . . Phil Harris sings
the theme song, "Isn't This a Night for
Love," to Helen Mack . . . Greta Nis
sen has a very minor role . . . Pho
tography excellent and very clever . . .
One of the best scenes: the ballet of
ice-skaters . . . Best minor character:
the steward, "Hicks"; we didn't get his
real name, sorry. . . . No plot, just a
merry story of romance on a steamer's
cruise from New York to Los Angeles.
"Private Detective 62" — William
Powell in a typical Powell role . . .
Diplomatic intrigue ... he loses his
job in the Service . . . subsequently
hooks up with a bum detective agency
. . . starts it on the up-grade ... a
gambler is really backing the com
pany, however, and the crook demands
condemning evidence on a very nice
girl whom the gambling establishment
owes more dough than it can afford . . .
Powell is picked to get the evidence
... its is inevitable that he falls in
love, cleans out the crooked mess, and
s+arts life anew in the diplomatic ser
vice . . . The girl is Margaret Lindsay,
and she is very charming. —C.D.
