# C. GILBERT WRENN GIVES SUGGESTIONS FOR SLOW READERS
## 
### 
Habits leading to better concentrative
facility, particularly with reference to
reading, were suggested by Dr. C. Gil
bert Wrenn in his talk on "The Ability
to Concentrate" last evening in the
Little Theatre.

Declaring that concentration is not a
general ability but rather specific
habits with reference to a given prob
lem, Dr. Wrenn remarked that most
people consider themselves to be unique
in their lack of concentrative power,
but in this impression they are wrong.
Dr. Wrenn referred to common dis
tractions which deter the reader's abil
ity to concentrate. Among these he
listed marginal noises which are on the
fringe of one's consciousness, bodily
sensations such as headaches, and ir
relevant ideas that enter the reader's
mind and distract him.
In Dr. Wrenn's opinion regular time
and place for study are of great im
portance. Focused reading in which the
student concerns himself actively with
his subject and has a distinct purpose,
is essential.
Referring to research done at Stan
ford, Dr. Wrenn emphasized the super
ior scholarship of students who prac
tice ordered habits of study.
Another element of importance is for
the student to commence his initial at
tack upon his task immediately upon
sitting down, before he commences to
think of unrelated matter.
