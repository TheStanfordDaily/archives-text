# Lack Of Interest Cancels Women's Tennis Matches
## 
### 
The women's handicap singles tennis
tournament, which had been scheduled
to begin tomorrow, has been definitely
cancelled.
Sponsors of the tournament decided
not to hold the matches because of the
lack of interest displayed by the women
attending summer quarter.
I Tennis prospects for next fall are
I much better, however, and plans for
an honorary tennis club are being
formulated to stimulate interest in the
court game during the coming year.
