# University To Contribute For Sewage Disposal Plan
## 
### 
Stanford University will contribute
to fixed and operating charges of the
new sewage disposal project to be
started soon by the City of Palo Alto,
according to word received from the
Comptroller's office.
The new unit will be of sufficient
capacity to adequately provide the
campus, in addition to Palo Alto, with
efficient conveyance of all sewage to
the bay. The use to which the campus
puts the new service will be checked
from time to time and will serve as a
basis for cost adjustment.
