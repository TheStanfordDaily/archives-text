# Garrison Prefers Wisconsin Law School's Organization
## 
### 
In a comparison of the organization
of the law departments of Stanford and
of the University of Wisconsin, where
he is a professor of law, Lloyd Kirkham
Garrison, acting professor of law this
summer, stated his preference for the
Wisconsin system, which allows the
completion of the law course in six
years, the last year of undergraduate
work at Wisconsin being similar to the
first year in Law School here.
In his comments upon the teaching
of law, Garrison presents the unusual
outlook of a man freshly recruited from
actual practice. Until his appointment
at Wisconsin a year ago, he was a
member of the firm of Parker and
Garrison in New York City. He ex
pressed himself as greatly intrigued by
the development of the university law
course and as keenly interested in his
association with it as a teacher.
Interested in Stanford
Stanford is the first school, aside from
Wisconsin, in which Professor Garrison
has had the oppoi-tunity of studying
this development from the inside. Al
though he refused to compare the rela
tive merits of Stanford and Wisconsin
students, he seemed deeply interested
in the school here and regretted the fact

that the brevity of the summer law ses
sion prevented a longer stay. He stated
that his experiences here have im
pressed him profoundly with the bene
fits to the professor of teaching in as
many schools as possible.
Professor Garrison is the great
grandson of William Lloyd Garrison,
Civil War abolitionist, who, previous
to the war, was noted as a most ag
gravating thorn in the side of the pro
slavery party. His agitation for the
freedom of the slaves at one time gained
him so much unpopularity that he was
almost lynched at Boston, in spite of
the fact that that city was noted as an
Abolitionist center.
Likes California
The intrepid independence of this
gentleman may be responsible for the
(easy informality of \his great-grand
son, who need fear no disparaging com
parison with Western joviality and
open-handedness.
Aside from his association with the
Law School, Professor Garrison ap
peared to find the Stanford golf course
and the "midget" taxicabs, which "are
remarkably nice about facilitating
transportation," objects worthy of at
tention in California.
