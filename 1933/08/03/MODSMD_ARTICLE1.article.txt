# Marjorie Gullan Wilis Plaudits In Poetry Reading
## Scotch Ballads Most Popular With Audience; Given In Dialect Recital Includes Pieces From Chaucer To Millay 
### 
Reading poems of different successive
periods from Chaucer to modern times,
Marjorie Gullan, of the University of
London, achieved her greatest effect
Tuesday night with three Scotch bal
lads, the last of which was unknown
to American audiences.
Unaccustomed to the ballad contests
which keep these old narrative poems
alive in the British Isles, Miss Gullan's
dramatic presentation of them appealed
immensely to her listeners. She gave
the spirit and swing of the verse as
well as the stirring stories and the
broad dialect of the old Scotch court
speech.
Program Varied
Her program included poems from
the late sixteenth and early seventeenth
century, sonnets from Shakespeare,
Keats, Shelley, and Edna St. Vincent
Millay; odes, ballads, selections from
the Bible and from Milton's "Samson
Agonistes," and concluding with a pas
sage from "John Brown's Body."
In all of these the entertainer ex
hibited a perfect technique and com
plete mastery of her voice, but her
studied variations in tone and her
marked emphasis on lyrical structure
detracted from the poems themselves,
so that it was impossible to lose one
self in her reading except where the
dramatic qualities of the verse gave
her scope for story-telling of charac
terization.
Such characterization made the "Man
on the Cross" and the death of Sam
son from the Bible especially good,
while the beauty of the sonnets by
Keats and Wordsworth and of some of
the earlier poems was lost in the read
er's interpretation of them.
Two Shakesperian Sonnets
Of those poems which did not call for
dramatic expression, the two sonnets
from Shakespeare and the "Ode to a
Gi*eecian Urn" were the best. She cap
tured the illusive, lingering grace of
the Shakespearian sonnets, and the
feeling of deathless, timeless beauty
that is paramount in the "Ode."
Miss Gullan is the founder and con
ductor of the London Verse Speaking
Choir and has made a detailed study of
British, Scotch, and Irish folk poems.
She has been on the summer faculty
at the University of California.
Following the recital a reception was
held in the Women's Clubhouse.
