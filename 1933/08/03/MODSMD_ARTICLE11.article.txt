# Wrenn Talks Of Vocational Choices To Exchange Club
## 
### 
"Vocational Choices" was the subject
of an address by Dr. C. Gilbert Wrenn,
assistant registrar of student personnel
at Stanford, before the weekly meeting
,of the Palo Alto Exchange Club.
One of the main dangers to be avoided
is too much interference by a coun
selor, Dr. Wrenn declared. It is import
ant to discover the best major subject
! for the student to follow and to de-
I velop habits of study and work.
Among research studies being made
i in this field, the speaker said, is a vo
| cational study of 20,000 Stanford alumni.
