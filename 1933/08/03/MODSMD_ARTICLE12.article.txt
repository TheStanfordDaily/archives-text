# More Jobs Than Applicants, Says Employment Head
## 
### 
For the first time in history there are
more jobs offered by the Appointment
Office this summer than there are ap
plicants. Several offer room or board
in return for two or three hours' work
a day.
There are also positions awaiting
French and Latin tutors, and one for a
three-piece dance orchestra.
A unique addition to the appoint
ment service this summer is its work
as a travel bureau, linking together
rideless students and studentless rides
that are journeying to all points of the
country. Anyone interested in going to
Los Angeles, San Diego, Idaho, or
Nebraska may find it worthwhile to
call at the office.
There is also offered a chance to
travel to Washington, D.C., on Sep
tember 1, or to Detroit, Michigan, on
August 15, all expenses paid.
Besides the student appointment of
fice, there is also an office which finds
permanent jobs for Stanford graduates.
All students are eligible to register and
are invited to call for the proper ap
plication forms. This service continues
long after graduation and strives to
suit personalities to jobs. It includes a
complete teachers' registration.
