# DAN ELLIS

Stanford students were shocked on Tuesday to hear of the sudden
deatli of Dan Ellis, '34. Although he had been seriously ill for a week,
latest reports had indicated the possibility of recovery.
The loss to the University in this case almost transcends the privation
of his best friends. Ellis was one of the three or four most prominent
men in his class. Throughout last year Ellis served as assistant yell
leader, and in the spring quarter was named head yell leader for 1933-34.
In addition, he was one of the ranking players on the varsity tennis team
â€”a consistent, and often brilliant athlete. He was awarded a block "S"
in this sport. The esteem in which he was held by his closest friends
was shown when he was elected to the presidency of his fraternity,
Alpha Delta Phi.
Those who knew Ellis well will remember, and regret the loss of, a
smiling, full-of-fun friend who had the knack of always being cheerful.
But the greater number, many of whom never met him personally, will
recall his broad smile and his appealing voice ringing out over the Stan
ford Stadium; will remember his successful efforts to revive dying spirit
in the last minutes of the last Big Game, when the exhausted Stanford
team held on doggedly in the late afternoon, and aided by that generated
spirit, succeeded in holding a vastly fresher California team.
