# A 						FREE JOLLY-UP
## 
### 
Stanford is to be treated to a free jolly-up tomorrow night.
The dance will be held in the same hall and with the same orchestra
as the last two, but this one will be free. That means that everyone can
dance to his heart's content from seven to eight-thirty regardless of
whether he has a penny to spare.
Toyon is sponsoring the jolly-ijp and Bill Sim, president of the Hall's
Summer Club, urges everyone to drop in and enjoy an hour and a half
of dancing to the now well-known Canfield's Gardens orchestra.
The Campus should show its appreciation of this genuine effort to
contribute to summer social life â€”and the best way to show it is to go to
the jolly-up.
