# A 						NEW LECTURE SERIES
## 
### 
At 8 o'clock tonight a new lecture series starts in the Little Theatre.
Air. Albert I. Elkus, who is a faculty member of the San Francisco
Conservatory of Music and a music lecturer at the University of Cali
fornia and Mills College, will give four weekly lectures here on different
topics concerned with music.
This series is one that every music-lover should attend. And even
those who may not fall into the class of confirmed "music-lover" will
enjoy the lectures. Mr. Elkus can so describe music that even the more
"non-musically inclined" will be enabled to appreciate good concerts.
Tonight the first lecture is scheduled for 8 o'clock; it will begin
promptly at 8 o'clock. It would be a most fitting greeting for Air. Elkus
if the audience arrived at the Little Theatre on time.
