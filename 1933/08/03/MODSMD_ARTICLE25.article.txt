JIG-SAW COMMENT
No one sighs when a hostess flings them down,
A futile maze of hit-or-miss; jig-saw
Puzzles are all the evening's rage. Smooth' cards
Lie shelved in musty packs while sleek blonde heads
Bend low with puckered brows above the wreck »
Of some fair world of flowers and flaunting fern,
Or puzzled poet, sick-a-bed with rage
Of dissonance And no one smiles or lifts
A brow at this chaotic labyrinth
Upon the tables of aristocrats.
It fits the times as gloves fit pulpy hands
That have no strength. 'Twas ever so; in hell
Men play the games that match their fuming wits,
And here we frown upon a pasteboard maze
Of tortured pictures torn apart by saws.
We shout with joy when one weird bit of curve
Fits snug another empty hollow sphere,
Or stripes with stripes match up, or nose with brow.
So Caesar fiddled while Rome burned below.
