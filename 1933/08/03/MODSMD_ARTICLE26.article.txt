COCKTAIL HOUR and TOMORROW
AT SEVEN—Varsity Theatre.
Cocktail Hour—Woman fights again
for freedom and is vanquished as usual
by the all-conquering male who loves
her enough to follow her to Paris to
show her how completely indifferent
he is.
Bebe Daniels, as the successful young
commercial artist, spurns the love of
the dependable Frank Morgan and flees
to Europe for a vacation of moonbeams
and champagne. The moonbeams fade
to disclose a middle-aged married phil
anderer. Too much champagne leads
to a fight in Bebe Daniels' apartment
in which he is unfortunately killed by
a young French rival, who declares his
love, confesses his crime, is forgiven by
the French police, and returns home
to Mamma while his beloved swears
never to be a bad girl again and
weepily embraces the house of Morgan.
Muriel Kirkland, as a Russian pianist
from Kansas who, offering consolation
and advice, steals a good part of the
show in a role which allows her to
play a feminine counterpart of Charlie
Ruggles. Bebe Daniels has her best
scene waking up with a hangover, but
her acting is passable throughout.
Tomorrow At Seven—This boasts
three murders, four hand-to-hand
fights, and a kidnapping. In addition
the hero is suspected of the murder
for a good two-thirds of the picture.
Chester Morris, as the sophisticated
young novel-writer who finally un
earths the real criminal and has the
satisfaction of seeing him killed with
his own weapon, manages to be effec
tive despite the fact he is required to
do nothing but disrupt the aim of in
numerable pistols and pack a good
right-hand punch.
The newsreel has some good shots of
the Italian navy and the latest in
gliders. —E.F.

HER BODYGUARD—Stanford Theatre.
If you like your wisecracks dished
up piping hot and right out of the
oven, you're sure to enjoy "Her Body
guard" with Edmund Lowe and Wynne
Gibson. Lpwe, as "Keyhole McCarthy,"
offers enough laughs to sustain you for
a week. He is commissioned by one of
Miss Gibson's many admirers to guard
her Diamond Lil jewelry. After one
look at Miss Gibson as Margot Briane,
a well-known musical comedy star,
guarding jewelry becomes merely a
necessary evil as far as Lowe is con
cerned. Margot Briane is just a re
fined way of saying Maggie O'Brien,
however, and as is inevitable the Irish
gets the upper hand and the Briane
and the O'Brien are changed to Mc-
Carthy in a sort of Pollyana ending.
Alan Dinehart plays a fair supporting
part and additional bits of excellent
comedy are furnished by Marjorie
White and her verbal sparring partner.
W. C. Fields makes a rather trite
comedy, "The Barber Shop," amusing,
and "Nertsery Rhymes," a musical
short subject, gives diversity to the pro
gram and displays some worthwhile
stage settings.
A Fox Movietone Review completes
the show. —A.B.
