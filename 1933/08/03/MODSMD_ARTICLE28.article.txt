# SYMPHONY CONCERT SEASON COMES TO CLOSE ON SUNDAY
## 
### 
The concluding program of the eighth
season of open air concerts in the
Woodland Theatre will be given Sun
day afternoon with Ossip Gabrilo
witsch, director of the Detroit Sym
phony Orchestra, conducting.
This will be the second concert con
ducted by Gabrilowitsch this season.
The program combines well-known
numbers with a sprinkling of less
familiar selections. The principal offer
ing will be, not the conventional sym
phony, but the well-known and popu
lar "Scheherazade Suite" by Rimsky-
Korsakow, which is an attempt by that
composer to put into melody the stories
known to us as the "Arabian Nights."
Two of the numbers on the program
are new to Woodland listeners; Duben
sky's "Fugue for Violins and Violas"
and Mottl's arrangement of Gluck's
Ballet Suite.
The complete program follows:
Ballet Suite Gluck-Mottl
Symphonic Suite "Scheherazade"
Rimsky-Korsakow
Fugue for Violins and Violas
Dubensky
Prelude and Love Death from
"Tristan Isolde" Wagner
Polovetski Dances from "Prince
Igor" Borodin
