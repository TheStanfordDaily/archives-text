# Unruly Freshman Appointed To Sleuth Himself
## 
### 
It was way back in 1925 when a
sharp explosion awakened sleeping En
rinians.
Aroused, the frosh appointed their
brawniest member to find the guilty
one. But the long hunt proved fruitless.
Recently someone childed the brawny
fellow over his failure as a sleuth.
"Well," he answered, "I knew who
the guy was, but I had reasons for not
turning him in."
"What reasons?" came the query.
"One in particular," he replied. "I
was the guy."
