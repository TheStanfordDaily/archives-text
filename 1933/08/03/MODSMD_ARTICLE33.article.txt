An official touch will be added to the
water carnival next Wednesday when
Henry Ingwersen, swimming commis
sioner of the Pacific Association of the
A.A.U., will be on hand to referee the
meet. Accompanying Ingwersen will be
a number of Pacific Association timers,
so that if "Buster" Olds is successful in
his try for the 300-yard record, there
will be no doubt of its acceptance.
Although just out of high school,
Olds has set for himself an outstanding
swimming record, having taken second
place in the Chronicle Golden Gate
swim for the past two years.
Kendall Ellingwood with six each, and
Frank Parker with four.
Continuing his winning ways in the
discus, Here Laborde, Card weight man,
competing for the A.A.U. in interna
tional meets in Europe, tossed the plat
ter 158 feet 10 107-128 inches in a meet
in Hamburg, Germany, to easily take
the event. Not so good, however, was
his attempt in the shot put, for in this
event German athlete Hans Sipvert
heaved the iron ball 49 feet 8 5-64
inches to win over John Anderson and
Laborde.
Lawson Little, Stanford golfer, won
medal honors in the thirteenth annual
Broadmoor invitational meet at Colo
rado Springs, Col., as he shot a 71 in
the playoff with Earl Berryhill, Sa
pupa, Okla., with whom he tied in
regular qualifying play.
Although first-round matches were
to have been played before Tuesday,
only a few of the games have been
played in the summer singles tennis
tournament. Myron R. Schall, physical
education instructor, said that players
in first-round matches must meet im
mediately.
In early games Joe Mendelson
downed Rupert Prohme, Bill Hoffmann

defeated Bob Fisher, and Leland Stu
debaker whipped Ed Perko. Later,
Studebaker defeated Hoffman.
Competition is close in the summer
swimming pentathlon with Norman
Sears leading the senior group with
ten points, followed by James DeLa

mater with eight, Kenneth Livingston
with seven, Frank Parker with five,
and Jack Clumeck with two.
Even closer is the novice class with
both Dick Buckwalter and Bob Jen
kins tied at seven, Harold Juda and
Kendall Ellingwood with six each, and
Frank Parker with four.
