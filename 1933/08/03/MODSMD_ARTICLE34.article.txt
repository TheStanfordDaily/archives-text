# EDUCATION GROUP HEARS ENGELHARDT AT WEEKLY LUNCH
## 
### 
Speaking on the "Plight of Educa
tion in the Midwest," Fred Engelhardt,
acting professor of education for the
summer quarter, addressed the weekly
men's luncheon of the School of Edu
cation yesterday.
Professor Engelhardt, who is from
Minnesota, described conditions in the
Northwest but paid particular atten
tion, by way of example, to his own
state. "People are still accustomed to
thinking of this section as a pioneer
section when, in reality, it has reached
almost its maximum growth. It is not
lack of people that has made the proper
support of public schools so difficult,
but rather the depression, coupled with
recent crop failures," he said.
"There is," Engelhardt continued,
"enough government and people to sup
port good schools, but not on as de
detailed a program as has been at
tempted. We must condense and com
bine our present system in order to
improve the conditions of the individual
unit.
"We need leadership, particularly in
the legislature. Until we get it we can
not hope for much improvement."
