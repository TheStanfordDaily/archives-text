The resourcefulness of Washington
State College students was exemplified
during the past school year by The
Dukes, "batching" group, who in addi

boarders to further economize.
Because of reduced state appropria
tion and decreased attendance the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh will dismiss about
75 faculty men, put others on part time,
and probably later make a second 10
per cent cut in salaries.
