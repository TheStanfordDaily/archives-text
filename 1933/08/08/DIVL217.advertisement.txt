STANFORD POETRY-VI
SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO
Through broken arches moonbeams softly shine.
Long blossomy rose-sprays, trained by padres' hands,
Entwine with slender olive leaves in bands
Of wind-kissed tracer . Gray walls combine
With low tiled roof to guard this lonely shrine
Upraised by saintly souls at love's commands.
Despite Time's ravages, this altar stands
In beauty fairer than the night divine.
Oh, shadowy-haunted cloister where songbird
Ofte joined with priest and choir in heavenly praise,
Your sanctity the passing years enhance.
Naught but a leaf down-fluttering now is heard;
Yet your loved bells to realistic days
Ring clear with golden echoes of romance.
Alice C. Cooper
