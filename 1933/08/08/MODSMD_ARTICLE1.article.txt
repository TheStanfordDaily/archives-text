# Fred Stover In Farewell Bow To Stanford Stage
## 'The Mad Hopes' Is Highlight Of Summer Quarter Dramatics Director â€“ Player Has Major Part In Play Friday 
### 
Making his last appearance on the
Stanford stage, Frederick Stover, head
of summer quarter dramatics, will be
seen Friday night in the role of Claude
Hope, one of the major parts of "The
Mad Hopes," to be produced under the
sponsorship of the Committee on Pub
lic Exercises.
The opportunity which made the role
available to Stover, who is also director
and designer of the play, is the fact
that Claude is required to play a piano,
and at tryouts not a single piano player
put in an appearance .Curtailment of
the financial budget prevented renting
an extra piano and "faking" the scene,
so the director stepped into the breach
and the Friday night audience is prom
ised at least one fine performance.
This will be the last of a large num
ber of roles with which Stover has
supplemented his work here at Stan
ford as technical director. He will be
remembered by many as Ludovic in
"The Mistress of Briony," and as Baron
Cesaria in "Death Takes a Holiday."
Further successes in the vicinity of the
campus include "Aren't We All" under
Gordon Davis, "The Doll's House" with
Peg Randall Converse in Palo Alto,
"The Devil Passes" with the Temple
Players in San Francisco, and a pro
duction of "Alice in Wonderland,"
which he directed, designed, and acted
in at Saratoga last summer.
This quarter concludes the fourth
year of Stover's affiliation with Stan
ford dramatics, to which he came di
rect from the Yale School of Drama
after only two years of the regular
three-year course.
