# Eells Talks On Cost Of Living

### 
Speaking on "Teachers' Salaries and
the Cost of Living," Professor Walter
C. Eells of the education department
told the audience last night in the
Little Theatre of the results of his
studies which he has recently finished
in that field.
Professor Eells has computed an in
dex for finding the cost of living of
those in the teaching profession to take
the place of the index of the bureau
of labor, which is very inequitable for
teachers. The bureau of labor index
gives 40 per cent of the budget of the
individual to food, the price of which
has dropped greatly during the de
pression.
Professor Eells showed, however, that
food takes only 20 per cent of the
salaries of the teachers. Thus their cost
of living has not dropped as has the
cost of living of the laborer, while
salaries have been reduced on the bu
reau of labor index.
Another bureau which is often left
out of consideration is that of the de
pendents on teachers resulting fi-om
unemployment in other fields. This
burden has increased as much as four
fold irt some sections and is often com
pletely disregarded in salary cuts.
Professor Eells has just published a
book on the same subject from which
much of the material for this lecture
was taken.
