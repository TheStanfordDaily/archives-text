# "Dad" Cubberley Speaks At Education Lunch Tomorrow
## 
### 
"Dad" Cubberley, retiring dean of
the Stanford School of Education, will
be speaker at the last of this summer's
series of luncheons for the men of the
educational group, to be held at the
Union dining hall tomorrow.
Cubberley's address is expected to
draw many to the luncheon in lieu of
the fact that his work in educational
problems has been widely acclaimed.
The meeting will be characterized by
the usual program of songs in addi
tion to the address, as the men enjoy
the fellowship of these weekly lunch
eons for the last time.
