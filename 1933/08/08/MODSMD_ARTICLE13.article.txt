# Fifty Geologists Meet To Study Earth Faultlines
## 
### 
Fifty prominent geologists from all
parts of the world will visit the cam
pus tomorrow and Thursday in the
course of a western excursion, one of
several that have emanated to various
sections of the country since the con
clusion of the sixteenth International
Geological Congress held in Washing
ton, D.C. Different groups will visit
the University on the two days.
Tomorrow Dr. Bailey Willis, emeri
tus professor of geology at Stanford
and a noted authority on earthquakes,
will talk at the San Andreas fault to a
party of geologists who afterward will
drive about the campus and Palo Alto.
In the afternoon the party will travel
to the East Bay region and study the
Hayward fault.
Breakfast at Union
After a breakfast at the Union on
Thursday, another party will be ad
dressed by Dr. Willis at the San An
dreas fault, center of the 1906 earth
quake. The auto caravan will then pro
ceed via Skyline boulevard to the Cliff
House, Golden Gate Park, and to Twin
Peaks, where an examination of the
Franciscan formation will be made.
Following luncheon at the Engineers'
Club, the party will proceed to examine
the Berkeley hills and tour the Uni
versity of California. At dinner at the
U.C. Faculty Club, Dr. Cyrus Tolman
of the Stanford geology department will
speak.
May Visit Russia
Dr. Eliot Blackwelder, head of the
geology department, who has just re
turned from the Washington conven
tion, will lead one division of the
geologists over Tioga Pass to Mono
Lake, where the party again divides
with Dr. Blackwelder leading a group
to the Pyramid Lake region.
Meeting once in three years, the In
ternational Geological Congress last
convened in South Africa and will
probably meet next time in Russia.
Visiting different sections of the world
following each meeting enables the
scientists to examine the various for
mations of the earth with the men who
have made a special study of these re
gions.
