# ELKUS' MUSIC TALKS
## 
### 
In his lectures on music Albert I. Elkus is carrying on in happy
fashion the illuminating simplicity that characterized the series on
graphic and sculptural art by Professor A. B. Clark.
Like Professor Clark, he is condensing into a few one-hour discourses
some of the essentials that provide subject matter for year courses, or
the contents of large volumes.
Furthermore, while his lectures are sound and scholarly, the pre
sentations of an expert with which no musical expert would disagree,
they are set forth with a simplicity and lucidity that brings what he has
to say within the easy understanding of all who hear him.
I lis charm as well as his effectiveness lies in his simplicity and
sincerity. He is thoroughly in earnest in his presentation of what music
means, emotionally and in technique, but not too deadly in earnest; he
is not afraid of the glow of humor.
The key to his power can be found in the fact that he is a genuine
lover of music. As a man of affairs, his avocation was music; now he
finds it possible to make music the chief thing in his life.
All who heard Mr. Elkus' first lecture are not likely to miss the
other three; those who did not will do well not to miss them.
