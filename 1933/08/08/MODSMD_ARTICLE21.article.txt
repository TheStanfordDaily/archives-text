Tomorrow the swimmers who have been competing during the
summer in the pentathlon events will put on their final exhibition —the
summer water carnival.
For the first time, the public is invited to watch these mermen in
action in the beautiful Encina pools. Coach Nort Thornton, who has
been instructing the boys in their favorite events, announces the after
noon program is free of charge to everyone.
Perhaps one of the greatest attractions is the young Buster Olds,
who will attempt to better the record for 300 yards that Johnny Weiss
muller set in 1924 and, while in the midst of this try, will also hope to
break the 250-yard mark set by a former Stanford swimmer in 1918.
A water polo game between two picked teams with several Stanford
stars will also be an interesting feature of the carnival. Various swim
ming races and diving events are also scheduled for the afternoon and
should offer good entertainment.
