# A 						BENEFIT TEA
## 
### 
The Union Club is sponsoring a benefit bridge-tea tomorrow after
noon in the Women's Clubhouse.
The women are endeavoring, by this tea, to raise sufficient funds to
equip the new women's residences with such furniture as radios, drapes,
and other luxuries that will not otherwise be supplied.
The tea should provide an interesting program for everyone who
enjoys bridgeâ€”and the proceeds will be used wisely.
