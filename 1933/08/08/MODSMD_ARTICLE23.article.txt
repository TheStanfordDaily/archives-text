SWEEPINGS and SONG OF THE
EAGLE—At the Varsity Theatre.
"Sweepings"—Lionel Barrymore can '
always be counted on to put over a '
creditable if slightly montonous job of |
acting. In this he does nothing to equal
his work in "Grand Hotel" or "Ras- ;
putin," but he again draws the likeable,
bourgeois, wholly devoted husband and I
father.
Despite 'the sentimentality of the
story, which culminates with the young
est son leaning over his dead father's i
body and whispering huskily, "I'll try,
Dad," it holds your attention, and if '
you like the chronicle type of picture,
this will appeal, for it starts with Mrs.
O'Leary's famous cow.
"Song of the Eagle"—All the elements
necessary to please the good American
public are here—a sweet old German
mother, who incidentally eliminates the
villain, a regiment of the American
Legion lustily roaring "Hinky Dinky
Parley-vous," Richard Arlen, who acts
first and gets his orders afterward, and
plenty of Hofmann's Amber Brew.
If you want to see what the inside j
of a brewery looks like before and after
prohibition, go and see this. You can
also watch the rise and fall of the
American speakeasy
Both shows are good entertainment,
but the newsreel offers nothing but |
more shots of Italy's pride in the mili
tary line. —E.F.
DOUBLE HARNESS—At the Stanford
Theatre.
For subtle and sophisticated comedy
coupled with suave and finished act- i
ing few pictures could better that of
"Double Harness" with Ann Harding
and William Powell. The plot itself is a j
bit complicated and it taxes the cred
ulity of even the most imaginative,
but the cleverly written dialogue more |

I than makes up for any other defi
ciencies.
Ann Harding's blonde beauty suc
| cessfully takes the part of Joan Colby,
j a society girl who believes that mar
■ riage should be regarded as a business
j and sets about to prove it to William
' Powell as John Fletcher, a wealthy
I young bachelor who feels his only re
sponsibility to be that of spending his
annual income from the Fletcher Ship
| ping Lines. Miss Colby, after much
maneuvering, becomes Mrs. Fletcher,
but after that things are not so simple.
1 In spite of obstacles such as a spoiled
and extravagant sister who "spills the
; beans," as it were, about the marriage,
Miss Harding conquers all, and the
couple lives happily ever after—or so
the audience is led to believe.
An entertaining Masquers Comedy,
j "The Moonshiner's Daughter," offers
plenty of amusement. A good Mickey
Mouse Cartoon, a Bobby Jones short,
and a newsreel complete the show.
