Continuing his winning ways on for
eign soil, Stanford's husky weight man
Here Laborde chalked up two firsts and
a third in international track and field
meets in Germany. Competing at the
town of Hanover, Laborde easily took
the discus event with a toss of 158 feet
8 inches, but could only place third in
the shot put which was won by Hans
Sievert, German shot-putter, with a
heave of 51 feet 1 7-16 inches. Two
days later the Cardinal giant won the
discus event with a throw of 154 feet
5 25-128 inches, competing in Berlin.
In winning the discus, Laborde on both
occasions bested Olympic champion
John Anderson. America won both
meets.
Keith Gledhill, former Stanford ten
nis player, downed Ernest Kuhn, 7-5,
2-6, 6-3, as he moved into the second
round of the Eastern Grass Courts ten
nis championships at Rye, N.Y.
Stanford's golfing future took a de
cided up-swing when it became known
that Verne "Spec" Stewart, 20-year-old
Southwestern amateur golf champion,
will enroll here this fall. Stewart, a
freshman last year at the University
of New Mexico, will leave for the Coast
soon after he defends his New Mexico
golf championship at the State meet at
Roswell, August 23 to 27.
Because three matches have not been
played off, the whole summer session
tennis tournament is at a standstill.
Myron R. Schall, physical education in
structor, hopes that Peter Weinberger
will meet Bob St. Denis, Bob Jenkins
will meet J. Lebert, and that James
Madden will meet Allan Mendleson.
Another title was won by Stanford
golfer Lawson Little when he defeated
Harry Gaddy, Tulsa, Okla., youth, 4
and 3, in the finals of the 13th annual
Broadmoor invitationtal tournament at
the Broadmoor Golf Club, Colorado
Springs, Colorado.
