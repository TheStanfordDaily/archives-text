# Craven Appointed Federal Railroad Economic Advisor
## 
### 
Leslie Craven, '09, has been appointed
an aide to the Federal Co-ordinator
of Railroads, according to J. E. Mc-
Dowell, alumni secretary. Craven will
fill the position of Economic Advisor
to the co-ordinator for the purpose of
drafting a new legislation plan for the
future regulation of the railroads as
required under the terms of the Emer
gency Transportation Act.
Craven's appointment is non-political
and his assignment is an important one,
involving questions of great public in
terest and requiring a review of the
entire field of railway regulation in the
light of changed conditions,
After completing undergraduate and
law studies at Stanford, where he was
awarded Phi Beta Kappa honors,
Craven practiced law at Portland, Ore.,
and continued there until 1917, when
he moved to Chicago.
Here he was engaged as first assistant
counsel and later as counsel of the
Associated Western Railways on valu
ation matters until 1932, a period dur
ing which he participated in legal prob

lems of national importance.
Craven resigned active law practice
in 1932 to assist in establishing the
College of Law of Duke University. It
is in his capacity of professor of law
there that he has undertaken to assist
the Federal Co-ordinator of Railroads
in working out the solution of railway
regulation.
