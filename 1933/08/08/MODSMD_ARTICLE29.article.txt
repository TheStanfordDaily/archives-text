# ELKUS LECTURES ON VARIETIES OF MUSIC APPEALS
## 
### 
Delivering the first of four lectures
on music, Albert I. Elkus spoke Thurs
day evening in the Little Theatre on
music as an emotional expression and
as pure design, with illustrations on
the piano.
In the most interesting part of his
lecture lie compared music like that
of Beethoven, which is devoted to emo
tional expression as procured through
chords and harmonies and music like
that of Bach and Hydn which is mainly
dependent on a structural appeal, a
cantrapuntal interrelation of all parts
of the composition, which is peculiar
to the last 250 years, having been de
veloped since Bach.
Musical Form Traced
This structural form follows the de
sign of presentation, exposition, and re
capitulation of the themes. It has pro
duced such abstract forms as the sym
phony, rondo, fugue, and sonata.
He demonstrated the intricacy of
musical form by tracing on the piano
the development of several themes from
Bach and Beethoven. The evolution of
these show how design is constructed
and monotony eliminated.
In speaking upon emotional expres
sion, Elkus also emphasized the use of
rhythm and gave examples of it from
Beethoven and the Elizabethan madri
gals. The more primitive the music,
and the more it is written to satisfy the
composer rather than the auditor, the
more emotional stress will be found
present.
This emotional appeal includes that
of ideation. Although definite ideation
has long been repudiated by many com
posers, it has so unconsciously become
embodied in the works of all promi
nent artists, for instance in the Wagner
leit-motifs, that it must be conceded a
place in the development of music.
It is necessary that there be a com
bination of the emotional and struc
tural appeals. Such a combination will
be found to have crept into all great
works despite the composer's theories
of the superiority of one type over
another.
Elkus also mentioned various other
appeals which are prominent in the
creation of music. Each of these is de
pendent for its accomplishment upon
the use of some of the others, as it is
almost impossible to separate rhythm,
design, interweaving of melodies, emo
tion, ideation, harmony, and structure.
These appeals are all present at the
same time so that when we enjoy
music, we are seldom conscious of
which attracts us, but usually one ap
peal will be more imperative than
others. The ordinary composition rare
ly emphasizes the development of more
than two, although all may be present.
Elkus will lecture in the Little Thea
tre at 8 o'clock Thursday evening on
"The Gregorian Chant, a Treasury of
Melodic Design."
