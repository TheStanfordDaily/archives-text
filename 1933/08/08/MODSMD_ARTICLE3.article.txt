There are two different views on the
subject of unemployment reserves,"
Hansen says. "I will attempt to show
that the effect of such reserves depends
entirely on the way in which they are
administered. Some of the methods
which have been suggested for accom
plishing this would exert such a power
ful influence on the credit structure of
the country that the unemployment re
serves might usurp the power of the
Federal Reserve banks. In any event,
the question would arise of setting up
a special, independent credit control
mechanism or one co-ordinated with
the Federal Reserve System."
