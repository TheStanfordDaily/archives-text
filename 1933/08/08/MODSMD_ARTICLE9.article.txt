# E. E. Robinson Talks Tonight On "America"
## History Professor Will Speak On Recent Protest Movements 
### 
In a lecture to be given tonight in
the Stanford Assembly Hall on "Where
is America?" Professor Edgar E. Rob
inson, Margaret Byrne Professor of
American History, will discuss the
movements of protest that are being
carried out in the United States today
as in relation to the historical situa
tion resulting from the revolution of
the past six months.
Answering his query "Where Is
America?" Professor Robinson will
summarize the basic traditions and
characteristic practices which have ap
peared in the United States as a result
of (a) our colonial experience, (b) our
theory as expressed in the Declaration
of Indepence, (c) our practice as em
bodied in the Constitution, (d) our
long up-coming as a frontier people.
- Professor Robinson long has taught
that there may be hope in an educa
tion for a citizenship that will provide
Americans with a citizen body informed
enough, intelligent enough, and brave
enough to make "the world safe for
democracy."
Professor Robinson is head of the
history department at Stanford and is
the author of several well-known books.
He is a Fellow of the Royal Historical
Society of Great Britain and a member
of the Historical Manuscripts Commis
sion of the American Historical Asso
ciation.
