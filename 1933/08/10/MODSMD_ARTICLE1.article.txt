# Albert I. Elkus Speaks Tonight On St. Gregory
## Music Critic Will Discuss Famous Melodic Chant Of Composer Lecturer To Consider Growth Of Plainsong 
### 
Delivering the second of a series of
four music lectures, Albert I. Elkus,
lecturer in music at the University of
California and Mills College, will speak
at 8 o'clock tonight in the Little
Theatre on "The Gregorian Chant; a
Treasury of Melodic Design."
He will explain the original elements
of the Gregorian chant or plainsong,
and the development of its possibili
ties in the polyphony of later com
posers.
The plainsong as it is used in the
music of the Church was first notated
by St. Ambrose and later revised by
St. Gregory, from whom comes the
name, Gregorian chant.
Palestrina is the greatest master to
employ the melodic design of the chant.
Elkus will illustrate how it served as
the principal melodic formation of his
music. He curtailed the flourishes and
the free rhythm of the plainsong and
developed the modern habit of making
a chord of each note.
Elkus is a faculty member of the
San Francisco Conservatory of Music
and a pianist of some note. In his first
lecture he demonstrated his ability to
explain his subject in terms non-tech
nical enough for the least musical of his
listeners.
