# STUDENTS OF MINE

Harold Helvenston, assistant profes- J
sor of English Public Speaking and
head of the dramatics department, has
had a group of students of
I theatrical art pass under his tutelage,
j When approached about the success of
j these students after they had left Stan
ford, the director said:
"It is manifestly too early to predict j
certain success for even the most gifted
of these aspirants. But there is keen
pleasure in the hope which their po
! tentialities inspire.
"A number are already engaged pro- .
i fessionally. There is Tom Henry, an
associate producer with Gilmor Brown
in the Pasadena Community Playhouse.
Henry is best remembered at Stanford
I for his work in 'The Wild Duck' and
'The Ivory Door.' Jack Rea has ap
[ peared on professional stages of Pasa- j
dena and Los Angeles.
"Perhaps the most talented actresses
I who have been turned out of Stanford

! during the last four years are Mrs.
Thomas Pike (the former Katherine
Keho), who played the leading role
in five major productions while here;
; the versatile Dorothy Tully, who
should some day land a corking job
provided that she doesn't leave the
state of single blessedness (and even
j then she might—who knows?); Ruth
Beede, a brilliant actress; Barbara Col
-1 lins, the most powerful actress of the
last two years; and Virginia Wilson,
one of the most sensitive and charming
i students ever to grace the Stanford
stage."
"Technically-minded students who
worked in classes in stage design and
technical direction are George An
dreini, who has for two years occupied
the position of technical director at the
i University of Oregon; Harriet Sutton,
an exceptional designer who hits since
diverted her attentions to work of a
more academic nature in Los Angeles;
Virginia Volland, who has been seen
in several New Yoz-k productions in
cluding A1 Jolson's 'The Wonder Bar';
and John Yeon, an outstanding student
in design who, I believe, is now study
ing painting and architecture," said
Helvenston.
"The field of law has won some stu
dents who might have gone far in act
ing. Arthur Hurt and Irving Rosenblatt
are two who entered law after distin
guishing themselves as Stanford Thes
pians.
"The Yale '47' workshop has at
tracted a great many students who de
sire to further their training toward a
professional cai'eer. This group includes
Gaillard Fryer, who has shown par
ticular promise along the lines of act
ing and playwriting, and Palmer Field,
who is studying production and tech
nical direction. The 1933 crop of Yale
minded students includes Eleanor Furst,
Barrel Ross, and Eminel Halstead, all
of whom will probably study produc
tion.
"Naturally, it must not be forgotten

that these students are all young—ex-
tremely young—indeed, most of them
have just finished their training at
Stanford. The most pleasing thought
about them is that if their work in j

Stanford dramatics is any sort of an
index or portent of their future aecom
plishments, Stanford may well be proud
of these enthusiastic followers of
Dinonysus and the tragic muse."

Dinonysus and the tragic muse."
Harold Helvenston, assistant profes- J
sor of English Public Speaking and
head of the dramatics department, has
had a group of students of
I theatrical art pass under his tutelage,
j When approached about the success of
j these students after they had left Stan
ford, the director said:
"It is manifestly too early to predict j
certain success for even the most gifted
of these aspirants. But there is keen
pleasure in the hope which their po
! tentialities inspire.
"A number are already engaged pro- .
i fessionally. There is Tom Henry, an
associate producer with Gilmor Brown
in the Pasadena Community Playhouse.
Henry is best remembered at Stanford
I for his work in 'The Wild Duck' and
'The Ivory Door.' Jack Rea has ap
[ peared on professional stages of Pasa- j
dena and Los Angeles.
"Perhaps the most talented actresses
I who have been turned out of Stanford

! during the last four years are Mrs.
Thomas Pike (the former Katherine
Keho), who played the leading role
in five major productions while here;
; the versatile Dorothy Tully, who
should some day land a corking job
provided that she doesn't leave the
state of single blessedness (and even
j then she might—who knows?); Ruth
Beede, a brilliant actress; Barbara Col
-1 lins, the most powerful actress of the
last two years; and Virginia Wilson,
one of the most sensitive and charming
i students ever to grace the Stanford
stage."
"Technically-minded students who
worked in classes in stage design and
technical direction are George An
dreini, who has for two years occupied
the position of technical director at the
i University of Oregon; Harriet Sutton,
an exceptional designer who hits since
diverted her attentions to work of a
more academic nature in Los Angeles;
Virginia Volland, who has been seen
in several New Yoz-k productions in
cluding A1 Jolson's 'The Wonder Bar';
and John Yeon, an outstanding student
in design who, I believe, is now study
ing painting and architecture," said
Helvenston.
"The field of law has won some stu
dents who might have gone far in act
ing. Arthur Hurt and Irving Rosenblatt
are two who entered law after distin
guishing themselves as Stanford Thes
pians.
"The Yale '47' workshop has at
tracted a great many students who de
sire to further their training toward a
professional cai'eer. This group includes
Gaillard Fryer, who has shown par
ticular promise along the lines of act
ing and playwriting, and Palmer Field,
who is studying production and tech
nical direction. The 1933 crop of Yale
minded students includes Eleanor Furst,
Barrel Ross, and Eminel Halstead, all
of whom will probably study produc
tion.
"Naturally, it must not be forgotten

that these students are all young—ex-
tremely young—indeed, most of them
have just finished their training at
Stanford. The most pleasing thought
about them is that if their work in j

Stanford dramatics is any sort of an
index or portent of their future aecom
plishments, Stanford may well be proud
of these enthusiastic followers of
Dinonysus and the tragic muse."
