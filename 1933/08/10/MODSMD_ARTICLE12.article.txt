# Hansen Speaks On Depression
## 
### 
Professor Alvin H. Hansen of the
University of Minnesota and acting pro
fessor of economics, gave an enlighten
ing lecture yesterday in the Little
Theatre on the subject of "Unemploy
ment Reserve and Business Stability."
Much has been written about un
employment insurance during the de
pression, but few people have gone into
the subject as has Professor Hansen.
One of the main problems which has
arisen to puzzle investigators is how
to take care of the huge reserve funds
which will be built up during pros
perity. One of the main objections to
the idea of unemployment insurance
has been that a great amount of money
will come under the control of unscru
pulous politicians. Hansen says that in
the German system the reserves are
under honest control, and that there is
little room for fraud.
There are a number of places where
the funds might be kept, such as in
savings banks, in the Federal Reserve
banks, in commercial banks, and in the
United States Treasury. Also the funds
might be used to buy securities on the
open market, or to buy bonds from the
Federal Reserve banks.
All of these methods will have dif
ferent effects on the credit conditions
of the country and it is important to
use the right one. Some of them will
act as do the open market operations,
to stop inflation and deflation. Other
methods, such as the purchase of bonds
in open market operations, will have
the opposite and wrong effect, the
speaker suggested.
In the opinion of Professor Hansen,
the use of a part of the funds to buy
bonds from the Reserve banks with the
rest deposited in savings banks will be
the best plan. Thus the danger of help
ing inflation is eliminated and too much
power is not taken from the body which
controls the banking system of the
United States, the Federal Reserve
Board.
