In choosing a play for the summer quarter, Frederick Stover rejected
several of a more serious nature than "The Mad Hopes," which is light
comedy at moments almost approaching farce. It is a play like this which
in the past has proved most popular with Stanford audiences, and a large
part of the Dramatic Council deficit last year may be accounted for by
the scarcity of such productions.
An occasional "artistic failure" may be justified, but Stanford dra
matics has been all \oo prone to forget that it is a business organization
which depends for its existence upon pleasing the public. It is to be
hoped that the choice of another play which should possess the same
appeal as "Holiday," the one financial success of last year, marks an up
ward trend which will next year re-establish dramatics on a firm footing.
