# BE ON TIME

There will be 110 noises to drown out the opening lines of "The Mad
Hopes" when the curtain goes up at 8:15 o'clock tomorrow night.
The Committee on Public Exercises announces that with the rising
of the curtain all doors of the Assembly Hall will be closed, thereby
keeping latecomers outside until the conclusion of the first act.
The committee gave out the announcement when the Cornish players
were on the campus that latecomers would not be seated until after the
first act, but somehow those arriving late just wouldn't remain quiet in
the back of the hall. As a result, the continuous shuffling of feet and
banging of seats provided a distraction that certainly did not add to the
enjoyment of the play.
Learning that latecomers are not likely to co-operate by being quiet
while the play is in progress, the public exercises committee has disclosed
this latest ruling. By virtue of the "closed door policy," everyone who is
sufficiently interested in "The Mad Hopes" to arrive 011 time will be
assured complete enjoyment and freedom from disturbing noises.
The committee has acted reasonably in making its decision. At first
it tried to keep the tardy ones quiet as they strolled to their seats, but
without success. Then it announced that late arrivals would be seated
until after the first act; but still to no avail. By closing the doors, this
perplexing problem of maintaining a degree of quiet should be solved.
