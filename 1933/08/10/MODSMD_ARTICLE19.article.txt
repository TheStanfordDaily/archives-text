### 
Harold Helvenston, assistant professor of English Public Shaking
and director of dramatics, is one of the most popular professors in the
University. He came to Stanford as technical director under Gordon
Davis, replacing the latter in 1929 as director of dramatics.
Previous to that time he had studied at the Art Institute of Chicago
and the Yale School of Drama, where he was graduated as one of the
most brilliant and promising students, and had worked as an art and
technical director of the University Players of Southampton, Long Island.
Since coming to the Coast, he has been associated with the Bohemian
Club of San Francisco and for several years has taken charge of the
annual play.
Helvenston's work on the campus has been characterized by an inde
pendence and willingness to experiment rarely found in college dramatics,
ilis most notable production was, perhaps, "Wings Over Europe," in
which he succeeded in developing a convincing British cabinet from
twelve college actors, many of whom had little or no previous experience.
He has also gained recognition as a designer, displaying a collection
of stage designs in the 1933 Exhibition of The Architectural League of
New York. His book, "Stage Design," is one of the few practical texts
available in that line.
