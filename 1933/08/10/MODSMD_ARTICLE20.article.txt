# STANFORD POETRY--VIII

### 
THE WAY IT IS
Lady fair, your loving ways
Others glorify;
Others sing your songs of praise
Better far than I.
Others deem you not so worse,
Saintly, nothing less—
Thoughts my ungrammatic verse
Never could express.
Others celebrate your charm
To a fare thee well;
Others whom your looks disarm
Say you're pretty swell.
Others, poets young and old,
Worship at your shrine,
Chanting your soul divine, —
And your soul divine, —
Others call you tender, true, —
Others, note, not me, —
Knowing the way I do,
It would have to be!
—O'Neill
