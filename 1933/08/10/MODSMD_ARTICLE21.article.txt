DOUBLE BlLL—Varsity Theatre.
Christopher Strong—Katherine Hep
burn has a place in the constellation of
cinema favorites. Lacking only the legs
of Dietrich, she reflects the grace of
Garbo and the vitality of Shearer.
Opposite her plays Colin Clive. His
mature manner and placid voice at
tract the young aviatrix who hitherto
has preferred to sparkle in solitary
loveliness.
They are thrust together as an after
math of a frolicsome evening in which
a giddy hostess has them corralled as
exemplary objects.
Clive exemplifies the rare husband.
One who has "been married five years;
is still faithful to his wife, and willing
to admit it." Katherine is a woman
"over 21 years of age who has never
had a love affair and is willing to
admit it."
Between them there grows a tender
but futile love. Katherine is the darling
of the daredevils. Clive is conserva
tive, and far worse—Clive is married.
The story reaches a gripping climax
when Katherine realizes the impossi
bility of their relations. To prove that
"courage may conquer even love" she
takes up her plane, shatters the exist
ing altitude record, removes her oxy
gen mask, and crashes to the ground.
The lonely agony of Billie Burke as
Clive's wife and the tortuous doings
of Helen Chandler, who is cast as the
daughter, afford a background of dra
matic power.
It's Great To Be Alive—lf Edna May
Oliver can't make you titulate, no one
can.
In this frothy comedy she deals with
a weird malady which supposedly kills
all members of the male sex. For awhile
this is a sorry planet. Then, a surviving
specimen of the homo is found.
The songs of Raul Roulion and cock
ney nonsense of Herbert Mendin add
to the laughs. A nice variety of chorus
girls strut about. Except for its exces
sive length, it is capital entertainment.
THE GIRL IN 419—Stanford Theatre.
A telephone operator ushei's in "The

Girl in 419"—Jimmy Dunn in the lead
—and a telephone operator supplies the
closing remarks, but these are the only
slightly restful intervals in the picture.
Jimmy Dunn as the head of a city
emergency hospital keeps you on your
toes, only taking time out for a few
wisecracks now and then. Gloria Stu
art takes the part of Mary Dolan, who
comes to the hospital as an unidentified
girl, badly beaten up. Jimmy Dunn
saves her life and falls in love with
her while staying up three nights to
prove it.
Several complications enter the story
when Peter Lawton, an unscrupulous
gangster with a taste in art, reveals
himself as Miss Dolan's ex-sweetheart,
who, after attempting to do away with
her, becomes suddenly very solicitous
—because he is afraid that she will
talk.
Although there is plenty of excite
ment up to this point, it is nothing to
what follows. David Manners as Nich
ols, a young interne, saves the day by
poisoning Lawton because of a per
sonal grudge. Miraculously there are
no tell-tale evidences left, so no one
is accused of the crime—all of which
is a little hard to believe but neverthe
less makes a wonderful story.
Walter Catlett offers plenty of
amusement in a short comedy telling
that "Daddy Knows Best." A Traveltalk
on "New Zealand—The White Man's
Paradise" is interesting. A technicolor
musical short and a Fox Movietone
Review are also included in the show.

but futile love. Katherine is the darling
of the daredevils. Clive is conserva
tive, and far worse—Clive is married.
The story reaches a gripping climax
when Katherine realizes the impossi
bility of their relations. To prove that
"courage may conquer even love" she
takes up her plane, shatters the exist
ing altitude record, removes her oxy
gen mask, and crashes to the ground.
The lonely agony of Billie Burke as
Clive's wife and the tortuous doings
of Helen Chandler, who is cast as the
daughter, afford a background of dra
matic power.
It's Great To Be Alive—lf Edna May
Oliver can't make you titulate, no one
can.
In this frothy comedy she deals with
a weird malady which supposedly kills
all members of the male sex. For awhile
this is a sorry planet. Then, a surviving
specimen of the homo is found.
The songs of Raul Roulion and cock
ney nonsense of Herbert Mendin add
to the laughs. A nice variety of chorus
girls strut about. Except for its exces
sive length, it is capital entertainment.
THE GIRL IN 419—Stanford Theatre.
A telephone operator ushei's in "The

Girl in 419"—Jimmy Dunn in the lead
—and a telephone operator supplies the
closing remarks, but these are the only
slightly restful intervals in the picture.
Jimmy Dunn as the head of a city
emergency hospital keeps you on your
toes, only taking time out for a few
wisecracks now and then. Gloria Stu
art takes the part of Mary Dolan, who
comes to the hospital as an unidentified
girl, badly beaten up. Jimmy Dunn
saves her life and falls in love with
her while staying up three nights to
prove it.
Several complications enter the story
when Peter Lawton, an unscrupulous
gangster with a taste in art, reveals
himself as Miss Dolan's ex-sweetheart,
who, after attempting to do away with
her, becomes suddenly very solicitous
—because he is afraid that she will
talk.
Although there is plenty of excite
ment up to this point, it is nothing to
what follows. David Manners as Nich
ols, a young interne, saves the day by
poisoning Lawton because of a per
sonal grudge. Miraculously there are
no tell-tale evidences left, so no one
is accused of the crime—all of which
is a little hard to believe but neverthe
less makes a wonderful story.
Walter Catlett offers plenty of
amusement in a short comedy telling
that "Daddy Knows Best." A Traveltalk
on "New Zealand—The White Man's
Paradise" is interesting. A technicolor
musical short and a Fox Movietone
Review are also included in the show.
DOUBLE BlLL—Varsity Theatre.
Christopher Strong—Katherine Hep
burn has a place in the constellation of
cinema favorites. Lacking only the legs
of Dietrich, she reflects the grace of
Garbo and the vitality of Shearer.
Opposite her plays Colin Clive. His
mature manner and placid voice at
tract the young aviatrix who hitherto
has preferred to sparkle in solitary
loveliness.
They are thrust together as an after
math of a frolicsome evening in which
a giddy hostess has them corralled as
exemplary objects.
Clive exemplifies the rare husband.
One who has "been married five years;
is still faithful to his wife, and willing
to admit it." Katherine is a woman
"over 21 years of age who has never
had a love affair and is willing to
admit it."
Between them there grows a tender
but futile love. Katherine is the darling
of the daredevils. Clive is conserva
tive, and far worse—Clive is married.
