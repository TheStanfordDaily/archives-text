Speaking on the subject, "Where Is
America?" Edgar E. Robinson, Mar
garet Byrne Professor of American
History, discussed the revolutionary
movement in the United States during
the last six months before a large audi
ence in the Assembly Hall Tuesday
night.
Professor Robinson said: "The events
of the past five or six months have
shocked every true lover of America.
High expectation of a bright future has
been lost by this generation. It cannot
be said that our present plight was un
expected. We have been warned by
extremists time and again.
"A new America has come into ex
istence in the past forty years and it
has produced a new civilization. Our
program has promoted a continental
democracy."
Professor Robinson agrees with
James Truslow Adams in believing that
the crisis we face today is as much a
crisis in character as in economics or
politics.
"Determining the answer to this
question 'Where Is America?' is no
easy task," declared Robinson. "It may
be found in the building of the machine
structure, in the attempt to improve
society, in the changes in the industrial
situation, and in the change in attitude
of foreign affairs."
Professor Robinson closed the lecture
by saying "What we need are citizens
who look upon liberalism as the funda
mental creed of all free men and
women."
