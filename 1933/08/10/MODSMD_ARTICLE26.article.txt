# LOSSKY IMPORTANT IN DEVELOPMENT OF RUSSIAN THOUGHT SAYS "DUBLIN REVIEW"
## 
### 
"Nicolai Lossky combines breadth of.
outlook with geunine philosophic
method; he is of outstanding import
ance in the development of Russian
thought"
Thus Natalie Duddington, in a re
cent number of the "Dublin Review,"
characterized the Russian philosopher I
who is teaching here during the sum
mer.
Miss Duddington characterized the
starting point of Lossky's theory of
knowledge as his insistence on the
necessity of distinguishing between
subjective and objective aspects of
knowledge, i.e., between the act of
knowing and that which is known.
"Nicolai Lossky's system of meta-

I physics, 'concrete-ideal-realism,' is
that the world is for him an organic
whole composed of super-spatial and
super-temporal substances having their
ground in the Absolute God who is
their Creator and Preserver, and union
with whom is the final goal of their
I activity." He is led to this view by the
consideration of the relatedness of
things revealed to us in knowledge,
according to Miss Duddington.
Professor Lossky is teaching this
summer in two departments, philosophy
and Slavic languages. He has taught
at the Pedagogical Institute, Peters
burg; the University of Petersburg; and
at the Russian University in Prague,
where he has been since 1922.
