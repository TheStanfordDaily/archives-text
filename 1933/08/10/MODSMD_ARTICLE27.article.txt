# Former Editor Of "Daily" On Staff Of New Magazine
## 
### 
Richard J. Friendlich, former editor
of the Daily, is serving on the editorial
staff of the "Penguin," a new magazine
scheduled for publication this month.
The stated purpose of the magazine
has been to collect the best material
in college journalism, and produce a
magazine of wide scope and interest.
To this end, the "Penguin" has em
ployed such prominent young writers
as Betty Muller of California, Harry
Wooster, the "American Vagabond";
Arthur Arlett, former editor of the
Daily Califomian; and Will Stevens,
Jr., former publicity director of St.
Mary's College.
Among the articles announced for
publication is one by Elliott Roosevelt,
son of the president, entitled "I Don't
Like Democrats; I Don't Like Repub
licans, and Most of All, I Don't Like
Politicians."

In 1878 and 1879 Governor Stanford
carried through some photographic ex
periments, with horses as "actors," on
his Palo Alto farm, now Stanford Uni
versity. These were really the first pre
cursors of the moving picture.
