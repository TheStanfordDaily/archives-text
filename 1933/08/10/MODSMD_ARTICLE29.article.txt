# GEOLOGISTS VISIT STANFORD CAMPUS ON SCIENTIFIC TRIP
## 
### 
The first of two groups of visiting
geologists passed through the Stanford
campus late yesterday and another ar
rived in time for breakfast in the
Union this morning. These bodies are
comprised of geologists from all over
the world who have adjourned from
the recent meeting of the International
Geological Congress held at Washing
ton, D.C.
Over 400 hundred leading authorities
in the field of geological science con
vened in Washington for their sixteenth
annual meeting and upon its conclusion
a number have taken excursions across
the continent and visited places of
geological interest. The parties visiting
the campus are two of the groups on
such excursions.
Yesterday's visitors left San Fran
cisco in the morning and came by bus
down the Skyline drive in order that
they might survey the San Andreas
fault which lies along that highway.
After a pause on the campus they con
tinued to Berkeley.
Today's group, after being welcomed
at breakfast by President Ray Lyman
Wilbur and other members of the fac
ulty, left at 9 o'clock for San Francisco
via the Skyline drive. This group will
study the San Andreas fault and will
hear an account of the Crystal Springs
valley as a result of the earth's move
ments, by Dr. Bailey Willis, professor
emeritus of the Stanford geological
school.
These movements, according to Dr.
Willis, are known to extend into the
geologic past for at least 60 million
years. From San Francisco the party
will proceed to Berkeley where it will
dine at the U.C. Faculty Club and then
entrain for Yosemite.
