# Olds Cracks Swim Record At 250 Yards
## Early Sprint Tires Athlete; Fails To Lower Mark For 300 Yards 
### 
With "Buster" Olds breaking the 15-
year-old record of Norman Ross over
250 yards, and failing to break the 300-
yard American record of John Weiss
muller, the annual water carnival was
held yesterday afternoon in the Encina
pools. Besides the record attempt of
Olds there were various races, diving,
and a water polo game between two
picked teams.
Olds covered the 250 yards in 2:40.6,
breaking the former record by 6-10 of
a second; but could come only within
3 4-10 seconds of the 30-yard record.

reason for the failure of this former
Palo Alto High School boy in the longer
swim is blamed on the fact that he
covered his first hundred in very slow
time.

"Whites" to take the game by a one
point margin of 5-4. Best of the
"Blues" was Vlad Taranik, while James
Benet and Harold Juda played good
ball for the losers.
