Professor Buford O. Brown of the
journalism division addressed the Oak
land Advertising Club Tuesday at a
luncheon, in the Hotel Oakland.
The talk was in the nature of a criti

advertisements taken from Oakland
papers during the past month was used
to illustrate points having to do with
copy, display, and printing.
