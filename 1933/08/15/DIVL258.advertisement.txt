DEPARTURE
A red-throated sunset
Melting into dark sky
Dissipating slowly
Cloud gold
Into the waters.
A white-bellied sea-gull,
Cleaving the silence,
Gliding and veering
Astern
Into the sunset.
A slow fleeing oil-cloud,
Sensuously curling,
Drifting with black wings
Away
Into the twilight.
A jade-fingered rock-land,
Embracing the breakers,
Dropping the distance,
Dream-like
Into the darkness.
