# Elkus Speaks On History Of Ancient Chant
## Gregorian Choral Described By California Professor In Second Talk 
### 
In the second of four lectures on
music, Albert I. Elkus spoke Thursday
evening on "The Gregorian Chant â€”a
Treasury of Melodic Design."
He described the chant as "a sort of
religious folksong proceeding from the
inner shrine of religion, and filled with
spiritual depth." However, he ap
proached his study by considering it as
the basis of modern music and as
throwing a retrospective light on some
ancient music.
This chant was noted, at first crudely
by the use of neumes, and carried all
over the world, so that it became the
basis from which developed the forms
and style of the contrapuntal school.
"When written down," says Elkus, "the
Gregorian Chant represents the perfec
tion of musical design, and upon its
principles developed the work of Pales
trina, Bach, Haydn, and Mendelssohn."
The chant was oi'iginally built on one
scale which corresponded with the
white keys of a piano. It was not until
fifty years before Bach that the growth
of the chromatic scale allowed the
transposition of these ecclesiastical
nodes.
"Gregorian harmony," said Elkus in
conclusion, "has influenced every period
of music since it was itself first col
lected and notated. Its content varies
from the florid jubilatee to the poig
nant Christ-on-the-cross, and its most
important contribution is the develop
ment of beautiful proportion in con
trasting short and long phrases."
"The Development of Style and Form
in Music" will be the subject of Elkus'
next lecture, to be given Thursday
evening in the Little Theatre.
