Frances Theresa Russell, associate
professor of English, has started an un
usually large number of Stanford stu
dents along both the path of creative
writing and the study of English litera

In commenting upon the progress of
some of these students, Mrs. Russell
said: "Some of my loudest peals of

Duffus, Glenn Hughes, Edward Strong,

others.
"Of those who have continued in the
academic world, a group to be espe
cially proud of may be found among
our own Stanford faculty. Among the
i many others who have ranged near or
far from the Quad are: Charles Rich
ardson at Ames, Iowa; Lucia Mirrelies
at Montana State University; Miller
McClintock at Harvard; Charles Hodges
and Oscar Cargill at New York Uni

| versity; and Geroid Robinson, Carl
Shoup, and Harriet Hayes at Columbia.
"Among those who have continued
as teachers of English is George Pope
Shannon, dean of the School of Arts
j and Sciences in the New Mexico State
University, and acting associate profes
| sor of English at Stanford this summer.
"In journalistic, editorial, and crea
j tive writing there are a host, of whom
; one of the most interesting is Margaret
J Craven, whose short stories are familiar
to all magazine readers. This list also
includes Eleanor Cogswell, of the Palo
Alto Times; Carol Green Wilson, editor
of the Stanford Illustrated Review and
author of 'Chinatown Quest'; Frank and
Katharine Ames Taylor; Sinclair Trim
ble and Roland Hartley, doing editorials
| and short stories in San Francisco; and
