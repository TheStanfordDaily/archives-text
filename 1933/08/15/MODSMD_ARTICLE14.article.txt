# Lossky-Talks On Religion
## 
### 
"The Russian Orthodox Church
since the Revolution" is the subject of
a lecture to be given by Nikolai Lossky
of the University of Prague and acting
professor at Stanford, tomorrow at 4:15
o'clock in the Little Theatre.
Lossky will open his lecture with a
discussion of the atheistic propaganda
of the bolsheviks, who have tried to
blot out all semblance of a national
church in Russia. That they have not
been entirely successful is proved by
the origin of the "Living Church," of
which he will give the history, as well
as the policies of Metropolitan Sergius.
In conclusion the lecturer will tell
something of the revival of religious
life among Russian intellectuals since
the beginning of the twentieth century
and especially among the emigrated
Russians after the Revolution.
Professor Lossky is well qualified to
lecture upon this subject because of
his experiences in Russia after the
war. He was for a while retained at
the University of Petrograd, but finally
was imprisoned and exiled because of
his religious views.
He is also considered one of the
heads of the new Slavic religious move
ment, which is becoming increasingly
important throughout northern Europe.
