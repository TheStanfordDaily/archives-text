# Palo Alto City Engineers Finish Traffic Island Job
## 
### 
Actual construction of the new traffic
island at the intersection of University
avenue and the state highway has been
completed. The new roadway on the
south side of the island is now open
for traffic, and all that remains to
complete the project is the landscaping
of the island itself.
While this island was erected to match
' the Stanford side of the intersection
and to beautify the entrance to the
University, it also will serve greatly
in alleviating traffic congestion, espe
cially at the time of the Big Game and
when other important athletic events
'â€¢ are held in the Stadium.
