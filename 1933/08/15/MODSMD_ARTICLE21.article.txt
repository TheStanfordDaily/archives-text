# A 						GOOD RULE ENFORCED

### 
The men on the doors of the Assembly Hall Friday night be
praised! Through their efforts "The Mad Hopes" was presented without
the accompaniment of trampling feet of late persons shuffling to their
seats during the first act.
In the future this system of handling latecomers should be continued.
To those who have seen good performances marred by the noise of in
considerate people, the inauguration of this system is a blessing heaven
sent. To those who are to come to Stanford productions in future years,
the new system will mean efficient handling of and no annoyance to the
audience. The actors and actresses, too, will be able to go on without
that fear of having practically to shout their lines that they may be
understood.
But there is one improvement that can be made in the handling of
the audience, and that is: the doors should be closed more promptly after
the intermissions have been concluded. A good warning about two
minutes before the rise of the curtain on the next act should send the
audience to their seats without any difficulty. Mere flashing on and off
the lights is not a sufficient warning. Why not a chime or a gong to
warn that the next act is about to commence?
