# EVERETT DEAN MARTIN

### 
Eveertt Dean Martin is peculiarly a young people's author and
speaker. His interest lies with the generation now moving into power.
The author of numerous books on social psychology, Dr. Martin has
gathered much material from which he has drawn interesting opinions on
the present conditions of economic collapse and social lag, and tonight's
lecture should be worthwhile if only to hear these opinions.
A member of various educational groups and honorary societies, from
1919 to 1922, was the chairman of the National Board of Review for
Motion Pictures.
He received his B.A. and Litt.D from Illinois College at Jacksonville,
Illinois, in 1904 and 1907, respectively. After spending more than a
decade as the pastor of various churches in Illinois and lowa, Dr. Martin
became associated with the People's Institute in New York City. There
he is the present director of Cooper Union Forum, the largest center of
political and educational subjects in America.
