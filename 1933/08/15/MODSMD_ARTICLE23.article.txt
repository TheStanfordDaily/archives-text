"It might almost be said," declared Mrs. Frances Theresa Russell,
"that the earthquake shook me out of philosophy into English." What
ever the impetus, Mrs. Russell's untiring service to students of English
at Stanford is rendered only more remarkable by the fact that she has
found time to accomplish a great deal on her own account in the field
of literature. She has written "Satire in The Victorian Novel," "One
Word More on Browning," "Touring Utopia," "Two Poets," "A Dog
and a Boy," and various magazine reviews and critiques. She is also
included in Harrison's "California Poets," and edited "The Way of All
Flesh" for the Modern Readers Library.
As a student she was a Latin and Philosophy major, studying under
Professor John Dewey at Columbia, although she took her Ph.D. there in
English. She began her work at Stanford as assistant to William James,
at that time loaned to Stanford for a half-year by Harvard.
