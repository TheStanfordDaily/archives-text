# SPRINKLED AUTOS
## 
### 
The sprinkling system near the Library has proved of great incon
venience to people leaving their cars in the front parking spaces lately.
Frequently they return to their cars after studying to find the seats
covered with water, and the dust on the finish turned into splotches of
muddy marks. On some occasions, the sprinklers are turned on so
strongly that it is impossible to aproach the cars without getting wet.
The logical alternative for the student thus affected is to park by the
side of the Libraryâ€”on the graveled plot prepared especially for the
purpose by the University. There the likelihood of an undesired bath is
very remote, and during the summer there are not so many cars parked
by the Library that students are forced to leace them near the sprinklers.
