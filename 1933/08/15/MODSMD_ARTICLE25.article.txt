# SIN REARS ITS UGLY HEAD
## 
### 
Sin rears its ugly head in the Library. Some Stanford students are
forgetting that there are other people who would like to find the right
filing case in the right place and not mixed up with a dozen or so other
drawers on the tables in the catalogue alcove or in a file different from
the one intended.
These catalogue cases are marked not only alphabetically, but also
with numerals and distinctive emblems which should enable any person
of Stanford intelligence to return them to their proper positions.
Notices have been posted in plain English requesting that the cases
be returned as soon as the student has finished consulting them. There
is no reason why the few students who have been failing to comply with
this request cannot show some consideration of others who have use
for the index.
