DOUBLE BILL—At the Varsity.
"Penguin Pool Murder"—The best
part of a good double bill which the
Varsity Theatre has selected for its
current program. It is mystery and
comedy, usually a happy combination,
and this film is no exception. The story
revolves around the sleuthing of
screammgly funny Edna May Oliver,
who is a school teacher on the side, or
vice-versa. The cast is good. Robert
Armstrong plays the lawyer, and James
Gleason, the inspector—both parts with
which they are familiar. Mae Clarke,
blonde and beautiful, is the wife of the
murdered man; Donald Cook, a finished
actor, is her lover. It is good entertain
ment.
"Life in the Raw"—ls neither sex,
cigarette advertising, or Darkest Africa.
It is a Zane Grey Western, with all
the accoutrements in which the type
glories.
George O'Brien and alluring Greta
Nissen have the leads. Although a
"Western" part may be a comedown
for Miss Nissen from the casts in which
she has been playing during the last
few years, her blonde hair and shapely
form enhance the appreciation of any
ranch romance, a soothing variety to
its dazzling gunplay, chasing trains,
and dust-filled cavalcades.
There was a capacity crowd at the
Varsity last night, and it seemed to
enjoy both feature pictures.
THE STRANGER'S RETURN—At the
Stanford Theatre.
Variety of character portrayal is a
mark of the genius of Lionel Barry
more. His Kringlein of "Grand Hotel"
was timid and pathetic. His Rasputin
was raucous and uncouth. As a doughty
old man in "The Stranger's Return," he
is shrewd and lovable.
Well within his tottering days, he has
many idiosyncracies. But he is also
crafty, and suspecting the motives of
fawning relatives, he simulates insanity
to test their affections. The old man's
ostensible delusion that he is still fight
ing in the Civil War is a rich bit of
comedy. Except for a voice a bit too
unhalting for the years of his charac
ter, Barrymore is masterful.
The minor characters are exception
ally effective, with Miriam Hopkins
starring as the granddaughter. Stuart
Erwin as a soppish farmhand adds a
definite touch of humor.
"So This Is Harris," with Phil Harris
and Walter Catlett, has amusing mo
ments.
Bobby Jones's Dixie monotone is
heard in another of his series of golf
"shorts."
A good news reel rounds out the bill.

crafty, and suspecting the motives of
fawning relatives, he simulates insanity
to test their affections. The old man's
ostensible delusion that he is still fight
ing in the Civil War is a rich bit of
comedy. Except for a voice a bit too
unhalting for the years of his charac
ter, Barrymore is masterful.
The minor characters are exception
ally effective, with Miriam Hopkins
starring as the granddaughter. Stuart
Erwin as a soppish farmhand adds a
definite touch of humor.
"So This Is Harris," with Phil Harris
and Walter Catlett, has amusing mo
ments.
Bobby Jones's Dixie monotone is
heard in another of his series of golf
"shorts."
A good news reel rounds out the bill.
DOUBLE BILL—At the Varsity.
"Penguin Pool Murder"—The best
part of a good double bill which the
Varsity Theatre has selected for its
current program. It is mystery and
comedy, usually a happy combination,
and this film is no exception. The story
revolves around the sleuthing of
screammgly funny Edna May Oliver,
who is a school teacher on the side, or
vice-versa. The cast is good. Robert
Armstrong plays the lawyer, and James
Gleason, the inspector—both parts with
which they are familiar. Mae Clarke,
blonde and beautiful, is the wife of the
murdered man; Donald Cook, a finished
actor, is her lover. It is good entertain
ment.
"Life in the Raw"—ls neither sex,
cigarette advertising, or Darkest Africa.
It is a Zane Grey Western, with all
the accoutrements in which the type
glories.
George O'Brien and alluring Greta
Nissen have the leads. Although a
"Western" part may be a comedown
for Miss Nissen from the casts in which
she has been playing during the last
few years, her blonde hair and shapely
form enhance the appreciation of any
ranch romance, a soothing variety to
its dazzling gunplay, chasing trains,
and dust-filled cavalcades.
There was a capacity crowd at the
Varsity last night, and it seemed to
enjoy both feature pictures.
THE STRANGER'S RETURN—At the
Stanford Theatre.
Variety of character portrayal is a
mark of the genius of Lionel Barry
more. His Kringlein of "Grand Hotel"
was timid and pathetic. His Rasputin
was raucous and uncouth. As a doughty
old man in "The Stranger's Return," he
is shrewd and lovable.
Well within his tottering days, he has
many idiosyncracies. But he is also
crafty, and suspecting the motives of
fawning relatives, he simulates insanity
to test their affections. The old man's
ostensible delusion that he is still fight
ing in the Civil War is a rich bit of
comedy. Except for a voice a bit too
unhalting for the years of his charac
ter, Barrymore is masterful.
The minor characters are exception
