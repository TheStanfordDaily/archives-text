## 
### 
At a meeting of the English Review
Club held yesterday afternoon at the
home of Professor Henry David Gray,
Mrs. Frances Theresa Russell, associate
professor of English, read a paper con
cerning definitions of poetry in the
nineteenth century.
In describing the type of poetry, she
mentioned that Ruskin included the
lyric as a separate type which had been
disregarded by Bacon and Dryden.
Most poets, while idealizing the import
ance of rhythm and diction in form,
feel that brevity is a necessary quality.
Content is either imitative 01* inven
tive, and stimulating these are mem
ory, imagination, emotion, and reason.
These faculties are exercised in poetic
production and may be considered as
the "cause." The effect on both the
writer and the reader will give an
ethical and intellectual profit, and an
esthetic pleasure.
The reading was followed by a dis
cussion. Refreshments were served.

Three thousand five hundred miles
of white traffic striping were laid on
California roads last year.
