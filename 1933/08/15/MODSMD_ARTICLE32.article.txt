### 
"The Story of the United Press," an
, article by Stephen Vincent Benet re
| printed from the magazine, "Fortune,"
has been received by the library of the
Division of Journalism.
Stanford readers will be particularly
interested by the notices and portraits
of three Stanford men, Kail Bickel,
president of U.P.; Clem Randau, gen
eral business manager; and Harry
Frantz, editor at Washington of the
j South American service, which he was
I largely responsible for building up,
| traveling over the continent a number
j of times.
Of Bickel Benet quotes an estimate
that he is "the only real international
j journalist in harness," and summarizes
his earlier career as that of one "who
| was a small-town boy (in Geneseo,
Illinois) and as a schoolboy found
I cub-reporter work on the 'Times' in
j Davenport, lowa, across the Mississippi
from his home. From Illinois he trav-
J eled West because he was 'damned
| tired of living at home,' enrolled at
I Stanford University in California,

worked his way as a campus corre- j
spondent of San Francisco dailies. After
j three years he took a job as city editor
lof Old Man Scripps's San Francisco
, 'Daily News,' in lieu of a degree,
j Thence the newly formed United Press
| hired him at $30 a week."
Randau, the article says, "left Stan-
I ford University to join the air corps,
flew in Italy and France, came back to
j join the U.P. in San Francisco. He de
veloped into a star salesman, was made
| sales manager in 1926, business mana
| ger in 1931."
