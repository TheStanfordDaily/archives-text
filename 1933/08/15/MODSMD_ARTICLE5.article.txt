# Phi Diddles Fear Quake Will Make Domicile Woodpile
## 
### 
Phi Delts are due for a shake-up.
Such is the opinion of Dr. Bailey
Willis, Stanford earthquake au
thority.
Recently he stopped to glance
at the revamped exterior of the
fraternity house.
Proudly the foreman of the con
struction job pointed to the build
ing's new beauties.
But Dr. Willis was apparently
thinking of a great fault.
"Yes, it's nice," he said, "but
the first time there's a quakeâ€”it's
coming down."
