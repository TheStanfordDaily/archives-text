# Palo Alto Election Retains Prohibition By Close Margin
## 
### 
"Happy days" may be here again in
some places, but not so in Palo Alto.
By a majority of 157 against the sale
of even 3.2 beer which by congres
sional decree is "non-intoxicating," the
sale of "spirituous, vinous, malt, or in
toxicating liquors, or any admixture
thereof, or any alcoholic drinks what
soever," is prohibited in Palo Alto.
The vote on the charter amendment
porposal was 1174 against, and 1017 for.
The total of pro-beer votes polled in
Thursday's election was less than the
total of signatures on the petition de
manding that the election be called.
