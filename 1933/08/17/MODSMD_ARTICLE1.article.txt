# More Courses Will Be Added To Music List
## Fundamentals And History To Be Emphasized Says Allen Orchestra Reorganized As Regular Subject 
### 
To meet the growing demand for cul
tural courses, a number of new classes
in music have been announced for the
winter and spring quarters. Choral
classes will begin in the autumn as
usual. Orchestra, musical fundamentals,
and music history are to be the new
subjects, and the cultural rather than
the professional side is to be stressed.
Warren D. Allen, organist and lec
turer in music, is quoted as saying that
the object of the new lectures will be
to present music as a subject possessing
co-relations with existing cultural
courses in the schools of letters and
social sciences.
The orchestra course has been given
in previous years, but this year the
work will be reorganized on a basis of
university credit, which will mean more
effective work. In connection with this
course it is planned to have a concert
at the end of each quarter, under a
conductor to be selected. Several appli
cations from experienced conductors
are on file.
The announcement of courses printed
below gives complete details. The num
bers listed are course numbers:

Music History
No general course in History will be

sion students will be admitted to the
following courses, except by special
permission.
111. The Age of Bach and Handel
(1685-1760). —The musical history of
Germany and England during the 17th
and 18th centuries, and the influence of
this period on later developments.
Music as an interpretation of social,
scientific, artistic, and philosophical
trends during the Baroque era and the
Age of Enlightenment. Fee, $5.00.
2 units, spring quarter (Allen) (Room 84)

112. Music in the Romance Countries
(17th and 18th Centuries). —This course
is concerned with developments con
temporaneous with those studied in 111.
The courses may be taken together, but
division is made so that students in
Romanic Languages may select this
course singly, and so that English and
Germanic Language majors may elect
111 if they so desire. Inquiry is made
into the way in which music superseded
painting as Italy's greatest are, and into
the musical life in France during the
Golden Age of French literature. Fee,

Course 111, the fee for Course 112 will
be $2.00.
2 units, spring quarter (Allen) (Room 84)

The band will be continued and, in
all probability, will be included in this
program.
