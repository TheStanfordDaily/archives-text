MORE CONCERT SERIES
After the annual deliberation as to whether or not the financial risk
involved in the Concert Series can be undertaken for another year, the
A.S.S.U. office, by co-operation with a professional impressario, has
found a solution which should insure the series' continuance in succeed
ing years. The decision to retain the concerts is an excellent one, for
they are one of the few outstanding cultural attractions of the University,
as well as offering to a considerable number of studnets the opportunity
of hearing first-class artists.
The precarious financial condition of the Concert Series in the past
should not be accepted as the criterion of its popularity among the
students, for a vote taken last year reported a large majority in favor
of its retention.
