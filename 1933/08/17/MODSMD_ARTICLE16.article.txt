Dr. Bailey Willis, whose Students of Mine story appears in this issue
of the Daily, is one of the world's foremost seismologists and geological
engineers. He is not only a real scientist, but he is one who is applying
his knowledge for the betterment of humanity. During the past years
Dr. Willis has endeavored to make people living in regions subject to
earthquakes realize that earthquakes will come and has warned these
people that they should erect their homes and office buildings to withstand
the shock of subterranean disturbances.
In the course of his interesting career, Dr. Willis has traveled all
over the world, usually as a member of some scientific expedition. The
Carnegie Institution of Washington, D.C., sent him to China in 1903,
and named him chief seismologist of an expedition that explored Chile
in 1923.
In 1910 he was awarded the prized gold medal of the Societe Geo
graphique de France, and in 1921 he was elected to the presidency of
the Seismological Society of America, which office he held until 1926.
Dr. Willis was also the president of the Geological Society of America
in 1928.
Probably the most interesting of several books written by Dr. Willis
is "Living Africa," the vivid story of a scientist's experiences on the
Dark Continent.
Dr. Willis received his E.M. from the Columbia School of Mines
in 1878, and his C.E. degree the following year from the same school.
In 1910, the University of Berlin conferred on him an honorary Ph.D.
degree. He taught at Stanford from 1915 to 1922, when he was retired
as emeritus professor of geology.
