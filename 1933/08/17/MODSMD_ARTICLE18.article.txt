# HELP THE KIDDIES

Every little bit helps.
For five cents Stanford students can have their grades mailed home
to them by the Stanford Convalescent Home.
Why not avail yourself of this convenience? Especially since the very
small profits from the sale of these stamped envelopes is used in the
care of invalid children who cannot be supported by destitute parents.
The Convalescent Home is Stanford's own charity, and it is up to the
students to help as much as possible to assure its sucessful maintenance.
In days gone by, when there was no summer session at Stanford, a
group of students,.on the suggestion of Chaplain Gardner, brought some
needy children to the Farm for a healthy summer vacation. From this
beginning a number of women living on the campus and near Stanford
took up the project and the Stanford Convalescent Home grew. A num
ber of years ago the University turned the Stanfords' residence over to
the growing idea. Around this was built the present plant, which can
accommodate about seventy needy and invalid children.
In the spring of every year Stanford students take part in a "labor
day" at the Home. While the men cut wood, dig roads, and do rough
labor, the women students paint equipment, sell candy and cigarettes, and
wait on the f 'roughs" at the barbecue which is held in the evening. Pro
ceeds from a Masque Ball are also turned over to the support of the
Home.
