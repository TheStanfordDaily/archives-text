In a letter to Mayor Rossi, Stanley
Beaubaire, night editor of the Stanlord
Daily during the regular term, urges
that as part of the celebration to be
held upon the completion of the Golden
Gate and Transbay bridges, a move
be made to bring intercollegiate con
ventions and athletic events to San
Francisco.
By starting a drive now, he believes
that a number of the annual conven
tions of fraternities, sororities, debating
societies, and similar organizations
could be brought to San Francisco. He j
suggested that university students be
represented on the citizens' committee
which will plan the celebration.
