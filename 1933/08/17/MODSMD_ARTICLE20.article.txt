STORM AT DAYBREAK—At Stanford
Theatre.
Walter Huston is mayor of a tiny
village in Hungary. But he and his
wife, Kay Francis, are Serbians. They
hold the common hatred of their people
for the Hungarians. War breaks out
and the citizens are called upon to
pledge their devotion to Hungary.
There develops a series of powerful and
intriguing situations, presenting a film
of marked dramatic force. Huston dis
plays dejection and elevation with
equal ability, and this story gives him
ample opportunity to portray both.
Kay Francis has seldom appeared in
a better performance, while Nils Asther
proves himself quite capable of his ma
jor role.
Harry Langdon proves a sorry jester
in "Knight Duty," which is slapstick
comedy in its most absurd form.
"Screen Souvenirs," featuring a flicker
ing picture of Harry Houdini escaping
from a straight-jacket, is certainly
worth seeing.

DOUBLE BILL—At Varsity Theatre

"Disgraced"—This is the old story of
the farmer's daughter and the traveling
salesman —only in this case the farmer's
daughter is the daughter of a police
man, and the deep-dyed villain, Bruce
Cabot, a wealthy young bachelor. In
true, old-fashioned style, Cabot is killed
by the wronged girl's father on the eve
of his marriage to another woman. The
picture is saved from utter mediocrity
by the fine acting of William Carrigan
as Miss Twelvetrees' father. The ending
is thoroughly unsatisfactory, and leaves
the audience wondering just what hap
pened to almost everyone in the cast.
"Luck Devils"—lf Roscoe Ates had
been allowed to stutter a little bit more,
and if the thrills had been a little less
obvious, this picture would have been
greatly improved. As it stands, how

• • 1
ever, one gets a good idea of the inside
story of those "Luck Devils" who risk
their lives daily to do stunts for your
favorite pictures. Bill Boyd plays "Skip
per Clark," the best stunter of them
all, who finally loses his nerve and is
forced to quit. Dorothy Wilson is his
pretty but rather ineffective wife.
