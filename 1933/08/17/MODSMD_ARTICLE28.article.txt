Try a triolet.
Then you can't go wrong;
The rhyme's not hard to get.
Try a triolet.
Here the meter's set;
The words go like a song.
Try a triolet.
Then you can't go wrong.
—E. F.
Nasty, bad ol' triolet!
How it makes me fume and fret.
Never neat refrain I get.
Nasty, bad ol' triolet!
Su you see I toil and sweat,
Rambling through the alphabet.
Nasty, bad ol' triolet
How it makes me fume and fx-et!
—Leonard Bartlett

I bear a cross upon my back,
A cross that bends me low.
Of industry I do not lack;
I bear a cross upon my back,
For eighteen units I still lack,
So nowhere can I go.
I bear a cross upon my back,
A cross that bends me low.
—Margaret G. Lomax
A Man is known by what he earns;
His wife by how she spends it.
In busy marts where commerce turns,
A man is known by what he earns.
But when he bring it home he learns
She soon a-flying sends it.
A man is known by what he earns;
His wife by how she spends it.
J.M.G. and C.C.T.
