# Haddock Plans Music Program
## 
### 
A program of old English songs cov
ering a period of three hundred years,
from 1500 to 1800, will be given by
G. Marston Haddock, lecturer in Eng
lish (Public Speaking) at 8 o'clock
Tuesday evening, August 22, in the
dance studio of the Women's Gymna
sium. This will be the last of the Tues
day evening series of lectures.
Included in the selections will be
some songs with interesting historical
associations: the original version of
"God Save the King," which will show
the changes made in it since it was
first written by D. John Bull about
1600; "Lilli Burlero," which probably
did more to alter the course of English
history than any other song, with its
charming melody and satirical words;
and a song ascribed to Henry VIII.
Few professional singers have had as
varied experience as Haddock, who has
had long musical and dramatic training
in England and on the Continent, and
who has done considerable research in
the folk, ballad, and traditional songs
of England. He will preface his songs
with a brief history of their origin.
Thirteen of the songs included in this
recital were set especially for Haddock
by George Whitaker, one of the fore
most modern English composers, who
co-operated with him in arranging the
program.
He will be accompanied by Warren
D. Allen, University organist.
