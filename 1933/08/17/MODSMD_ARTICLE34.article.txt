the foothills, workmen are pushing four

a portion of the additional women stu
dents who are expected to enter the
University this fall, are being exten
sively remodeled. The addresses are 520

The sixth and seventh stack levels
of the main library, which were never
completed in the original construction

of that building, are now being made j
ready to receive books.

nearing completion on the site of the j
former home of that fraternity and
contractors have assured the boys that
all will be ready before the opening of j
the fall quarter.
