Essentials of Scx - een Acting."
In her lecture on voice for the screen
Mrs. Gable will emphasize the adjust
ment of the individual's speech mech
anism to recording machines. She be
lieves that anyone coming before the
public today in any capacity whatso
ever should understand the principle
of speaking through a microphone, so
that he can do so easily without losing
either personality or appeal.
She will also discuss how inventions
developing new sound registration have
forced both stage and screen coaches to
anticipate the new needs
The second lecture will contain a
short resume of the history of acting,
especially as it has developed in the
motion pictures. Attention will be given
to the relation of screen acting to
proper lighting and acoustics.
Mrs. Gable has had extensive experi
ence both in acting and coaching. After
graduating from Stanford she worked
with the Belasco theatre in Los An
geles, and with Marjorie Rambeau's
stock company, later organizing one of
her own. During the war she organized
theatres in army camps, afterwards
studying in Europe until she returned
to Hollywood to open her own school.
