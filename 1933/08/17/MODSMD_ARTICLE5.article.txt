# Lossky Tells Of Orthodox Church Status
## Russian Philosopher Speaks On Developments Since War 
### 
Speaking on "The Russian Orthodox
Church since the Revolution," Professor
Nikolai Lossky of the University of
Prague told the audience in the Little
Theatre yesterday afternoon of certain
changes that have occurred in that
church since the turn of the century.
Starting with a description of the
Orthodox Church and of the jubilant
celebrations it practices at Easter time,
which transport its followers, Lossky
told of the change resulting from the
introduction into the clergy of new ele
ments which supplanted the hereditary
clergy of before.
Revolution Brings Hard Days
With this new element came demo
cratic movements in the thoughts of
that body, and with the teaching of
Alexander Vedensky came a change
to a moi-e ecstatic form of worship that
met with the great approval of the
masses.
"With the coming of the revolutions
came hard days for the Church, how
ever," Lossky continued. "The former
democratic movement became associ
ated with people of questionable char
acter, and as a consequence, conserva
tives fell away in even greater num
bers.
Soviets Persecute Churchmen
"Now the Soviet government has pro
hibited the power of the old patriarchs
and the head of the Church is in the
hands of a compromise group under
the head of Metropolitan Sergius. De
spite denials by them, the Soviets are
constantly pursuing a policy of perse
cution. They are overcoming the out
ward show of it by bringing false
charges against those whom they wish
to exile and by saying that certain
factions wish churches to be turned into
museums. In reality, however, perse
cution is quite active."
In closing Professor Lossky told of
the growth of the Orthodox religion in
other parts of the world than Russia,
and correlated it with the general re
action in thought which has occurred
since the war. "Other phases of the
return are seen in the renewed study
of philosophy and mysticism," he said.
