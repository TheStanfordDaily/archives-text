# Santa Clara County Gets Funds For Highway Use
## 
### 
Santa Clara county has been allotted
$255,000 for highway construction and
maintenance for the next fiscal year.
This amount was based upon motor
vehicle registration and the need for
the projects as they affect the state
highway system as a whole.
This county's allocation is divided
into two projects. The main expendi
ture will be made on the Bayshore
tween the Lawrence Station road and
the Alviso-Santa Clara road will be
highway. Two and six-tenth's miles be
graded and paved for $240,000.
