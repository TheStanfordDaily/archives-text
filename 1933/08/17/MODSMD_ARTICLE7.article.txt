"In all my relations with the stu
dents, the human side has been of the
most interest to me," declared Doctor
Bailey Willis, emeritus professor of
geology. "The student who misses this
personal contact has missed the best
part of Stanford life, while the pro
fessor who fails in this respect is not
doing his part for Stanford.
"The most interesting student that I
ever had from the standpoint of perse
verance and sincerity was Mark Evans.
He came to Stanford in 1916 at the age
of 27. He had been out of school for
a period of ten years, during which
time he worked as a longshoreman in
Seattle and spent several years mining
in Alaska. His high-school education
was poor, but he was determined to
graduate from Stanford. He asked me
if it were possible. 'It can't be done,'
was my reply.

"Evans then related an incident that
happened to him in the Far North. He
felt that nothing was impossible after

, that. His raft was swamped crossing a
; river in Alaska and when Evans swam
' to shore he was stark naked; every
thing he possessed was gone. It was
mid-September and the nearest town
was 70 miles away, but he made it.
Having told this story, Evans said: 'I
am going through Stanford,' and he
did."
During his college career Evans was
: a member of the boxing team, although
he was blind in one eye. "No matter
how hard he was struck on his blind
side, he never flinched. A fine fellow,"
Dr. Willis said. Evans graduated after
seven years of study with the degree
of mining geologist. He is married, has
two children, and is now mining gold
in Idaho.
Three Years at Sea
A student of Dr. Willis' who staged
a fine comeback was De Witt C. Row
land. He was brilliant, but high-strung,
and a nervous breakdown caused him
to leave college a physical wreck. A
physician advised Rowland to go to
sea. He did this, and served for three
years as a common sailor, then re
turned to college, graduated, studied
law, and is now United States District
Attorney from Western Washington.
Another student, W. R. Malm, was an
excellent man, but along toward April
he began to slump. Doctor Willis called
him into the office and asked him what
was the matter. Malm thought he must
be getting tired. Doctor Willis saw no
reason for this excuse, as Malm was
carrying only 18 units.
Malm replied, "It isn't the hours, it
is my night job in the steel works at
South San Francisco from 8 to 5." The
man carried his school work, his job
in the steel works as chemical analyst,
and got an A average.

Having told this story, Evans said: 'I
am going through Stanford,' and he
did."
During his college career Evans was
: a member of the boxing team, although
he was blind in one eye. "No matter
how hard he was struck on his blind
side, he never flinched. A fine fellow,"
Dr. Willis said. Evans graduated after
seven years of study with the degree
of mining geologist. He is married, has
two children, and is now mining gold
in Idaho.
Three Years at Sea
A student of Dr. Willis' who staged
a fine comeback was De Witt C. Row
land. He was brilliant, but high-strung,
and a nervous breakdown caused him
to leave college a physical wreck. A
physician advised Rowland to go to
sea. He did this, and served for three
years as a common sailor, then re
turned to college, graduated, studied
law, and is now United States District
Attorney from Western Washington.
Another student, W. R. Malm, was an
excellent man, but along toward April
he began to slump. Doctor Willis called
him into the office and asked him what
was the matter. Malm thought he must
be getting tired. Doctor Willis saw no
reason for this excuse, as Malm was
carrying only 18 units.
Malm replied, "It isn't the hours, it
is my night job in the steel works at
South San Francisco from 8 to 5." The
man carried his school work, his job
in the steel works as chemical analyst,
and got an A average.
"In all my relations with the stu
dents, the human side has been of the
most interest to me," declared Doctor
Bailey Willis, emeritus professor of
geology. "The student who misses this
personal contact has missed the best
part of Stanford life, while the pro
fessor who fails in this respect is not
doing his part for Stanford.
"The most interesting student that I
ever had from the standpoint of perse
verance and sincerity was Mark Evans.
He came to Stanford in 1916 at the age
of 27. He had been out of school for
a period of ten years, during which
time he worked as a longshoreman in
Seattle and spent several years mining
in Alaska. His high-school education
was poor, but he was determined to
graduate from Stanford. He asked me
if it were possible. 'It can't be done,'
was my reply.
Swani Alaskan River
"Evans then related an incident that
happened to him in the Far North. He
felt that nothing was impossible after

, that. His raft was swamped crossing a
; river in Alaska and when Evans swam
' to shore he was stark naked; every
thing he possessed was gone. It was
mid-September and the nearest town
was 70 miles away, but he made it.
