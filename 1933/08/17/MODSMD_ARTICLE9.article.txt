# Martin Talks On Ideology
## 
### 
"We have kept the consolation psych
ology of the middle ages while we have
left behind the struggle for spiritual
excellency which they made." Thus Dr.
Everett Dean Martin, sociologist and
lecturer, explained the unrest of pres
ent times in his talk Tuesday evening
on "What Is the Matter with Modern
Ideas?"
The spirit of the times that accepts
all new things without persecution or
question is one entirely new in the world
and is an outstanding indication of the
unrest of the times, the speaker sug
gested. In the days of the thirteenth
century scholastics there was an or
dered civilization which prevented the
mental turmoil and doubts that so often
prevail in the individual of today.
"We are in the midst of a civilization
which is trying to support nineteenth
century romanticism and idealism, the
'escape' psychology, with seventeenth
century mechanism, which trys to ex
plain everything by laws and princi
ples," Dr. Martin declared. "These two
do not mix. Even the liberals who pro
fess to - be so advanced do not know
whether they are for the 'free spirit'
or for the conflicting 'social legisla
tion.'
"The answer to all this unrest, and
the end for which we should aim, is
that which the Greeks achieved in their
secular but ordered civilization. We
must work, as did the Greeks, toward
an achievement of excellence through
unaided human intelligence and good
taste."
At the end of the lecture an open
forum was held in which members of
the audience asked questions. Answer
ing an inquiry about the future of our
civilization in reaching toward this goal
of perfect knowledge. Dr. Martin de
clared that, from his observations at
the various forums which he has held
throughout the country, there seemed
to be a growing desire for such knowl
edge.
