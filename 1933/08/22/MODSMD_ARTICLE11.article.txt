# Elkus Gives Music Talk
## 
### 
The Gregorian Chant was made un
changeable by papal edict, and re
sourcefulness was therefore manifested
in its decoration, Albert I. Elkus pointed
out in his lecture on "The Development
of Style and Form in Music" Thursday
evening.
The Chant was wf ven to other melo
dies and eventually to chords of har
mony. In this manner the fugue and
larger musical fomis were evolved.
The speaker illustrated this process
by two-part ringing and phonograph
records. Perhaps the most striking of
these illustrations wa sthat of the
Gregorian Chant interwoven with an
English folksong in the form of a
madrigal.
"The Fugue of J. S. Bach" will be
the subject of Mr. Elkus' third lecture
to be heard Thursday evening in the
Little Theatre.
