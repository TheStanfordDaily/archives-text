# Stanford Has No Chance For Gas Rate Reduction
## 
### 
Whatever change is made in the basic
gas rate of Palo Alto no benefit will
accrue to Stanford. The city has made
applications to the state commission for
reduced rates on gas, hearings on which
have been held recently.
Palo Alto buys its gas from the
P. G. & E. and distributes it to the
residents. Stanford residents, on the
other hand, buy gas directly from the
P. G. & E.
