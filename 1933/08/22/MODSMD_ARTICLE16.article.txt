# TREAT RETURNS HOME
## 
### 
After a summer devoted to a trip in
New England and a tour of scenic
points in the United States, Professor
and Mrs. Payson J. Treat have re
turned to their home on the campus.
They visited in Boston and Wisconsin,
attended the Century of Progress at
Chicago, and toured the Yellowstone
National Park and the Black Hills. Pro
fessor Treat is a member of the history
department.
