# EDUCATION MAJORS LEAVE
## 
### 
Last week marked the closing of the School of Education, with 140
education students leaving the Farm.
Summer quarter has always been considered a term when the ma
jority of campus residents were teachers returning to Stanford to take
this course or that course, or perhaps for advanced degrees. Students in
other departments, and above all, undergraduates, were, as a matter of
course believed to be decidedly in the minority.
During this quarter there have been some five hundred students
registered. Since only 140 of those were here exclusively for educational
courses, the casual observer would infer that the Stanford community has
gathered this summer for the benefit of many more than education
majors, or that the education students have become interested enough in
outside courses to remain for the ten weeks session.
