# POETRY PRIZE
## 
### 
The generosity of the Stanford Bookstore has enabled the Daily
to present a prize to the winner of the summer poetry contest which is
ended by today's poem. The winner of the competition will be announced
in Thursday's issue, the last of the current volume.
Officials of the Bookstore have donated the "Oxford Book of English
Verse," generally considered to be the most complete short anthology of
the entire field and an indispensable companion to English studies.
Poems by faculty members are not entered in the competition, but
the Daily takes this opportunity to thank them for contributing verse.
The editorial board considered it fairer to limit the competition to
students.
The judges for the contest are Dr. Frances Theresa Russell, Dr.
Margery Bailey, and Dr. Henry David Gray.
