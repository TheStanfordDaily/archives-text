# SCREEN SECRETS OFFERED

### 
Josephine Dillon Gable, who speaks here tomorrow and Thursday
under the auspices of the Committee on Public Exercises, will discuss
in her lectures two subjects of considerable interest to the laymen.
Her first talk will stress the growing importance of universal speech
training. Radio appearances, public assemblies, and the like have become
daily features of American life and it is necessary that all types of people
should be trained to meet such occasions.
However, aside from emphasizing this angle of speech-training, Mrs.
Gable performs an equally important service to the uninitiated by saying
most strongly that only those who possess definite talents should attempt
the stage.
The lecture which deals with the "Essentials of Screen Acting" is
offered not so much for the education of prospective actors as for those
who attend the motion pictures. By learning some of the points which
determine a good performance, the spectator is able to take a more
critical view of a picture as a whole, and knowledge of what is good and
bad in acting goes far to enlarge his powers of appreciation.
Since it would be impossible to give more than a general, non-technical
outline in each of these lectures, their appeal is decidedly to the outsider
who would like to know a little bit more about the pictures he goes to see.
