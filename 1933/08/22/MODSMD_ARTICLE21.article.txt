Concluding the Tuesday evening lecture series, G. Marston Haddock,
lecturer in English (Public Speaking) offers one of the most interesting
programs of the quarter in his recital of English ballads this evening.
He will not only sing the ballads, but will preface each of them with
a short history of its origin. As he is himself an Englishman, and has
devoted his life to the study of these songs, liis remarks should contain
more than a cut and dried analysis of English folk music.
His experience as a professional singer has been complete and varied.
He commenced his musical training in the choir of Westminster Abbey,
later studying under such great English singers as Charles Neville, Ben
Davies, and Robert Radford, upon whose advice he went to Thomas
Meux of the Metropolitan, Covent Garden, and Paris Royal opera
houses.
He has worked with the Stratford-upon-Avon Festival Theatre and
was appointed vice-principal of the Leeds College of Music, Elocution
and Drama, in 1923. It was at Leeds that he entered upon his research
in folk music and hit upon the idea of featuring this music in concerts.
In commenting upon one of his concerts, Norman Scott of Rochdale,
England, said: "The recital made one feel that the careful researches and
sound musicianship which Mr. Haddock and Mr. Whitaker have devoted
to folk-song and traditional ballads will make a contribution of per
manent value to our knowledge of this branch of music."
This evening's program promises songs from an artist of singular
competence as well as the annotations of an authority. Such a combina
tion is unusual and should be well worth hearing.
