INTERFERENCE—At the Palo Alto
Community Theatre.
"Interference," produced Friday
night by the Palo Alto Community
Theatre, was given the greatest ap
plause of the current season, largely
because of the brilliant acting of Joseph
Whitaker, '31, Director of Dramatics at
Modesto Junior College.
Three other Stanford actors were in
the cast: Dorothy Tully as Lady Mar
lay, wife of the scientist risen to sudden
fame through a "revolutionizing" dis
covery; Hugh Harvey and William
Mahu, as newspaper reporters.
ANOTHER LANGUAGE—At the Stan
ford Theatre.
When a girl gets proposed to in a
taxicab driven by one Hyman D.
Hacklebeck almost anything is liable
to happen. In "Another Language,"
starring Robert Montgomery and Helen
Hayes, most anything does happen and
the story travels from one dramatic
scene to another. The plot itself, if
rather thin in places, gives ample op
portunity for fine acting, an oppor
tunity to which Montgomery and espe
cially Miss Hayes do full justice. Miss
Hayes is Stella, the lovely but unhappy
wife of Victor Hallam—Robert Mont
gomery—and is unable to get along
with the rest of the almost vulgar mid
dle-class and meddlesome Hallam fam
ily. Uo Stella they speak "Another
Language."
DOUBLE BILL—At the Varsity.
"The Little Giant"—ln stale smoke
and gloomy silence the Little Giant
Social Club hears the voice of the
electors. It's Roosevelt and beer; and
it's a sentence that can't be appealed.
In a way, their chief, "Bugs" Ahearn,
is glad it's over. He wants to "mingle
with the upper classes" and get sopped
with culture. Quitting Chicago, he ar-
rives in Santa Barbara where he goes
about "muscling in" on the society
"racket."
The role Edgar G. Robinson plays is
typical of his gangster characters who
manage somehow to be vicious but
kind, ignorant but clever, and world
wise but naive.
"Blame The Woman"—After recover
ing from the initial shock of seeing
Adolph Menjou in a sadly unkempt
condition, you'll settle down to thor
oughly enjoy this jolly story of the
doings of two rascals.
Adolphe Menjou's performance is
polished and witty. Claude Allister is
passable as his accomplice in conniving.

ily. Uo Stella they speak "Another

DOUBLE BILL—At the Varsity.
"The Little Giant"—ln stale smoke
and gloomy silence the Little Giant
Social Club hears the voice of the
electors. It's Roosevelt and beer; and
it's a sentence that can't be appealed.
In a way, their chief, "Bugs" Ahearn,
is glad it's over. He wants to "mingle
with the upper classes" and get sopped
with culture. Quitting Chicago, he ar-
rives in Santa Barbara where he goes

"racket."

typical of his gangster characters who
manage somehow to be vicious but
kind, ignorant but clever, and world
wise but naive.
"Blame The Woman"—After recover
ing from the initial shock of seeing
Adolph Menjou in a sadly unkempt
condition, you'll settle down to thor
oughly enjoy this jolly story of the
doings of two rascals.
Adolphe Menjou's performance is
polished and witty. Claude Allister is
passable as his accomplice in conniving.
