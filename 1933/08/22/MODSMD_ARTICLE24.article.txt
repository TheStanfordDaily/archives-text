BLUE-GRAY HILLS
Upon low eastern blue-gray hills I gaze,
And find them shrouded in a veil of grace,
Transforming a grim, ugly mountain face,
Which, seen before, failed to awaken praise.
This change my eyes behold can quickly raise
A question how unthinking men oft race
Through life, all heedless that they can erase
Dark blemish spots and easily set ablaze
Their souls. By living well—effort not hard—
Men Wcish away all noisome trace of soil,
And make their lives as beautiful, unmarred,
As blue-gray hills that rise above turmoil
To godly peacefulness for aye unscarred.
Leonard I. Bartlett, Gr.
