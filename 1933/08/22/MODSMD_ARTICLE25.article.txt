# "POP" LEAVES FOR NEW POST AT TEMPLE: WISHES "TINY" THORNHILL BEST OF LUCK
## 
### 
"I am wishing Tiny Thornhill and
the team the best of success for the
coming season. I have enjoyed my stay
here, ' said Pop Warner upon leaving
Friday to attend the summer meeting
of the Football Coaches Association at
Evanston, Illinois, where he v/ill speak
on "Preparing an Offense."
From Evanston Pop will go to Chi
cago where he will sit on the bench
with Dick Hanley at the special charity
game to be played at the World's Fair
on the evening of August 24. One team
will be coached by Howard Jones of
U.S.C. and will use the Jones system,
while the other will be coached by
Dick Hanley of Northwestern and will
use the Warner system. Pop thinks that
Hanley's team should have a little the
best of the going.
After the game in Chicago Pop will
spend a week in western New York.
Then he goes to Temple University,
where he is head coach, to start or

ganized practice September 5.
Pop does not expect too much of his
team this year. It will be composed
mostly of sophomores, but by 1934 the
boys should be moving right along.
Warner feels that University of
Southern California will have the best
material on the coast. California will
also have a wonderful team. Stanford
has better material than it has had for
several years and should have a good
season.
While Warner does not know much
about Oregon or Oregon State, he feels
that the Northwest will have two fine
teams in Washington and Washington
State. The University of California at
Los Angeles, he figures, should also
continue their climb up the football
ladder. "With so many strong teams the
conference race should be very inter
esting and it is doubtful if any team
can go through the season undefeated,"
Pop said.
