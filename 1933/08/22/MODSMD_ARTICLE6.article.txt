# Dean Compares Two Colleges

### 
"A comparison of Stanford and the
University of New Mexico is difficult,"
spoke Acting Professor George Pope
Shannon, who is dean of the college
of arts and sciences at the latter in
sitution. "But there are," he con
tinued, "several points of likeness. Our
students wear clothes approximating
the general condition of the Stanford
'rough.' Also, our football team lost
many of its games last year."
The ability of Stanford as a private
institution to choose its students per
mits it to enjoy the advantage of hav
ing more students of high academic
ability, in the opinion of Dr. Shannon.
There also exist certain limitations at
New Mexico, due to its being a state
institution. Dependence on state finan
cial budgets, political factors, and de
mands of the taxpayer for immediate
concrete results are among these. On
the other hand, Professor Shannon
stated, there is about the same degree
of ability manifested by the superior
type of student in each school.
"I notice very little change at Stan
ford since I was here in 1926," said
Professor Shannon. "There does, how
ever, seem to be a tendency to place
younger men on the faculty, with a
result that many of the faces familiar
to me have been retired."
Professor Shannon received his M.A.
degree at Stanford in 1923 and his Ph.D.
in 1926. His undergraduate days were
spent at Vanderbilt.
