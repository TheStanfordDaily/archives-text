# Drama Group To Give Only Reading Here
## Sword And Sandals Presents Henrik Ibsen's Tragedy "Rosmersholm" 
### 
Henrik Ibsen's four-act tragedy,
"Rosmersholm," has been selected by
Sword and Sandals as its sole reading
for the summer quarter. It will be read
in the Little Theatre tomorrow evening
at 8 o'clock.
Sword and Sandals, men's honorary
dramatic society, has sponsored a series
of readings of worthy plays for the past
year and a half, but because of a
crowded summer schedule, has con
fined its summer quarter activities to a
single reading.
Heading the cast of readers will be
Dr. Margery Bailey, as Rebecca West.
Dr. Bailey is well known for her ap
pearances in the past, the more recent
of which have been as Mrs. Alving in
Ibsen's "Ghosts," and the Duchess of
Malfi in John Webster's tragedy of that
name.
Plays Brilliant Role
James San doe, whose last appearance
in a campus play was as Dr. Stock
mann, will read the role of John Ros
mer, while Lee Chapin, last seen as the
Sheriff in "The Mad Hopes," will be
Mortensgard, Rosmer's brother-in-law.
Chapin has appeared also in other cam
pus plays, among them "Death Takes
A Holiday" and the reading of "Young
Woodley" some time ago.
A brilliant but small role, that of
Ulric Brendel, will be read by Sidney
Head, who has proved his competence
in many productions of the Palo Alto
Community Theatre as well as in sev
eral readings.
The cast will be completed by George
Leavens as Editor Mortensgard, June
Birchard as Madame Helseth, house
keeper at Rosmersholm, and John
Brash, who will read the necessary
stage directions.
Last of Social Dramas
"Rosmersholm" was the last of Ib
sen's social dramas, immediately pre
ceding his later symbolic dramas. It is
concerned with the struggle between
deep-rooted traditional moral con
sciousness and a more literal acquisi
tive consciousness.
Critics declare the characters of Re
becca West and Ulric Brendel to be
two of Ibsen's most brilliant pieces of
work. The play itself is usually placed
high upon the list of Ibsen's works.
The reading will begin promptly at 8
o'clock. Latecomers will not be seated
until the close of the first act.
