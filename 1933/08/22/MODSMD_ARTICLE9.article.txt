# "Pop" Puts Cream Of Past Gridders On All-Star Team
## 
### 
\ "This Ls no easy assignment," said
Pop Warner when he was asked to
j pick an all-star Stanford team from
men who played here during his years
on the Farm. Pop was sure of all posi-
I tions except tackle and left half. At
tackle he had to choose from Harry
Shipkey, Leo Harris, Tiny Sellman,
| Chuck Johnston, and Chris Freeman,
who is attending school this quarter.
For left halfback Warner's decision
lay between Lud Frentrup, Phil Mof
-1 fatt, Frankie Wilton, Dick Hyland, and
Bill Sim, the boy who really "went to
| town" for Stanford last season.
Ted Shipkey and Ed Walker were
picked as ends, Harry Shipkey and Leo
Harris at tackles, "Dynamite" Post and
Don Robesky at guards, and Walt
Heinecke at center, made up the line.
In the backfield Chuck Smalling was
placed at quarterback, Bob Sims and
Bill Sim at halfbacks, and Ernie Nevers
at fullback.
It is always interesting to note what
becomes of grid stars after their gradu
ation. Harry and Ted Shipkey, Wilton,
Robesky, Heinecke, Nevers, Smalling,
Walker, and Harris will coach this fall.
Bob Sims is working in San Francisco,
"Dynamite" Post in Los Angeles, and
Bill Sim, who has one more year of
; competition left, is registered this sum
mer and expects to become a coach
I upon graduation.
