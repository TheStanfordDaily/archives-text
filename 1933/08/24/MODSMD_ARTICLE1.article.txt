## Haddock Adds Remarks On Origin And History Of Selections Ballads By British Nobles In Recital 
### 
Featuring old English ballads, some
of which are still known here and in
England, G. Marston Haddock, singer
and lecturer in public speaking, gave a
recital in the dance studio of the
Women's Gymnasium Tuesday eve
ning.
Haddock interspersed the musical se
lections with pertinent remarks on the
origin and history of the different songs.
Well known of the numbers we re
"Lord Rendall," the tragic story of the
poisoned lovex-'s homecoming to his
mother; "Greensleeves," a ballad which
is still sung in England at Christmas
time; "Billy Boy," a satire on "Lord
Rendall"; and the original version of
"God Save the King," our "My Country
'Tis of Thee," which was written about
1600 and has varied in the melody very
little.
Of special historical interest among
the selections was "Lilli Burlero," the
words of which were written by Lord
Wharton as a revenge on James II for
appointing an enemy to a high position
of state. The ridicule, which the song
contains, of James and his appointee,
did much to undermine the loyalty to
the king and thus helped to drive him
out of the country. Also historically in
teresting was "Pastime with Good Com
pany," said to have been written by
Henry VIII.
Among the love songs rendered were
"Early One Morning," a song popular
in the time of Queen Victoria, and
"Thou Wilt Not Go," a beautiful mel
ody, using only five notes.
Many of the songs were arranged for
Haddock by the noted English com
poser, George Whitaker.
Warren D. Allen, University organ
ist, accompanied the singer.
