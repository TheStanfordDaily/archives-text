## 
### 
Introduced by Professor Henry
David Gray of the English department,
Mrs. Josephine Dillon Gable lectured
yesterday on "The Essentials of Voice
for the Screen" in the Little Theatre.
"The three elements of the sound
machinery comprise the power thai
i produces the friction which is ampli
i fied into sound," said Mrs. Gable. "Un
til the introduction of the talking ma
chine and the microphone the principle
aim of voice teaching was for volume,
but this has been changed to a great
' extent today."
Mi\s. Gable believes that there is still
' a feeling that hearing the radio or mov
ing picture is not quite the same as
seeing the people who act before you.
But she also believes that in the near
I future this feeling will be entirely done
away with.
She pointed out that "there are two
positive essentials of successful voice
| work, and they are complete relaxa
tion, and flexibility in the voice. The
voice muscles cannot be readjusted,
however, for they are automatic."
I In speaking of the machinery used
for the recording of voices Mrs. Gable
; said: "The sound machine can register
every type of speaker. The micro
phone at present is a very young and
! very imperfect instrument. New micro
| phones have been manufactured, how
| ever, that are far superior to any that
i are on the market now. They have not
I been released as yet, for business rea
| sons."
Mrs. Gable will give her second and
final lecture today at 4:15 o'clock in
the Little Theatre on the subject, "Es
sentials of Screen Acting."
