At last the time has come when the summer Daily must say Auf
wiedersehen to its patient followers.
As with all good things, the summer quarter must end, and is
rapidly drawing to a close—ten enjoyable weeks have slipped too rapidly
past, and soon we must he leaving the Farm. Some will return again in
October for the autumn quarter. Some will go to other colleges. Still
others will find themselves involved in the work-a-day world. So breaks
up this little Stanford family that has enjoyed so many pleasant and
instructive times together.
The Daily is hopeful that it has been able to bring its readers some
little information and, perhaps, inspiration. News has been scarce this
summer—it has been necessary to look far and wide to gather what has
been published. But the Daily has been able to tell of good concerts,
instructive and entertaining lectures by prominent people, to bear tidings
of social events sponsored by the Union Women's Club and Toyon
Summer Club, and of "The Mad Hopes" which was presented by the
dramatic group. It has as well given its readers a sample of poetry
written by fellow students. All this has played an important part in
Stanford's summer life.
Now, the struggling editorial staff must set aside its typewriters and
copy pencils and turn to the more serious business of strengthening
relations with textbooks and lecture notes; for once again it is finals time.
The Stanford Daily of summer quarter says Goodbye and Good
Luck.
