In his career at Stanford Professor Edgar Eugene Robinson has
contributed to the development of three branches of University activity.
In 1923 he organized and became director of citizenship. In 1929 he
became head of the history department, and for the past five years has
been chairman of the Independent Study Plan Committee.
Such a wide field of activity has given Professor Robinson some
contact with nearly all the students entering the University, and the
oportunity to know many upper division students majoring in other
departments than history. Ile has given invaluable service to those work
ing under the comparatively new Inde]>endent Study Plan, and his course
in Western Movement attracts a large number of non-history majors
yearly.
In his work outside the University Robinson is well known for his
study of American political parties and of presidential elections, lie is a
member of the board of governors of the Commonwealth Club of Cali
fornia and the author of "The Foreign Policy of Woodrow Wilson" and
"The Evolution of American Political Parties."
Aside from his duties as a professor he has achieved great popularity
as a sympathetic and friendly advisor upon the various difficulties which
beset the college student.
