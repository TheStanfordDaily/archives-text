# POETRY CONTEST ENDS
## 
### 
Completing a volume of "Stanford Poetry," the Daily announces
the results of the summer contest:
First Place: "Departure," by Edward F. Willis
Second Place: "Atavism," by Eleanor V. Engs
Third Place: "The Dogdays," by J. V. Cunningham
Honorable Mention:
"Jig Saw Comment," by E.M.F.
"The Untried Poet," by Carroll Toll.
The judges of the contest were Dr. Frances Theresa Russell, Dr.
Margery Bailey, and Dr. Henry David Gray of the English department.
The competition between first and second place poems was so close,
that the ballots were submitted to Dr. Paul Farnsworth of the psychology
department.
"Departure" was given one first place and one second place, but was
not mentioned by the third judge. "Atavism" was mentioned by all three
judges, receiving two second places and one third place. "The Dogdays"
and "Jig Saw Comment" each were given one first-place vote, while the
former also was given one third-place vote. "The Untried Poet" was
given one third-place vote.
The Daily wishes to thank the three judges for examining all the
poetry in the contest, and the Bookstore for offering the prize.
