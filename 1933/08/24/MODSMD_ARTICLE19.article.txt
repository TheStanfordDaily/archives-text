DOUBLE BILL AT STANFORD.
"Don't Bet On Love"—Lew Ayres is
cast as a plumber who is pai"tial to
parleys. His manicurist-sweetheart,
Ginger Rogers, opposes his pony piay.
After many soft arguments he finally
induces her to take a chance at the
matrimonial race. But she "breaks from
the barrier" when she finds out that
he is taking her to a racetrack for
their honeymoon.
The story then relates the rise and
fall of the "plunging plumber" as a
gambler. It presents Ayres in much the
same type of role as he played in
"O.K. America" as contrasted with "All
Quiet on the Western Front."
"Isle of Paradise"—An enthralling
camera record of the pageantry of life
on the tiny island of Bali. One is fasci
nated by the quiet beauty of the island
and the glowing smiles of its people.
It is one of the few pictures of native
life that leave one satisfied that it is an
accurate account of the labors and
pleasures of the people. The only blem
ish the picture suffers is the apparent
effoii of the producers to prolong it.
Towax-d the end one is apt to squirm
a bit while observing the laborious in
cantations of the native priests.
DOUBLE BILL—At the Varsity.
"The Key Hole"—is the best part of
a double bill which the Varsity Theatre
has selected for its current program.
It features Kay Francis, wife of a New
York millionaire, and George Brent,
super-smooth private detective.
The story revolves around a trip to
Havana, in which Kay is attempting to
get rid of a former husband who is
blackmailing her. Her husband becomes
suspicious and has her shadowed by
George Brent.
In Havana life moves very rapidly for
the wife falls in love with her hus
band's detective, the blackmailer falls
out of a window and is killed, and the
husband comes to Havana to take his
wife home, but is rejected in favor of
the detective. The movie-goer also gets
to see such famous spots as Sloppy
Joe's and other noted bars. All ends
happily for Kay; her husband returns
to New York, and she is left with Brent.
"The Secret of the Blue Room"—is a
real mystery thriller from start to
finish. Paul Lucas and Gloria Stuart
have the leads and both give good per
formances. The story is about a certain
room in a castle. Everyone who sleeps

in this room either disappears or is
murdered.
Paul Lucas finally breaks the spell
and comes out alive, bringing the mur
derer with him. The only flaw in the
plot is that the director neglected to
explain several of the previous mur
ders. It is good entertainment, however.

Stanford is prohibited from granting
honorary degrees.
