# MRS. GABLE ADVOCATES SCHOOL TO TRAIN EXPERT TECHNICIANS FOR MOVIE INDUSTRY
## 
### 
"A school should be established to
train men and women for the movie
industry," says Mrs. Gable. "The grow
ing need for expert technicians is be
coming crucial."
At present the industry employs
hundreds of men who are merely ac
quainted with their respective fields.
The engineers furnish the technical
demands, while the dramatic coaches
are acquainted only with direct pro
duction.
A combination of these two fields is
the present hope. If some university
could so train a person in engineering,
acting, and psychology, this problem
might be solved. Mrs. Gable said that
Stanford is the ideal institution to initi
ate such a department.
The present industry has been se
verely affected by the depression.

Within the next few years there will
be revision. The power can remain no
longer in the hands of a few indi
viduals.
Mrs. Gable declares that the movie
magazines are not barometers of public
opinion. The public is no longer in
terested in sex for sex's sake. New
stories, settings, and a sincere produc
tion is demanded.
She mentioned Greta Garbo as being
without doubt Hollywood's finest act
ress. In mentioning her own early
training, she spoke highly of Lewis
Stone as a remarkable teacher, a fine
actor, and a real gentleman.
For the development of a movie star,
she feels distrustful of formal training.
Experience in Hollywood, sincere study,
and a few "breaks" are the steps to
movie fame. This applies to the
as well as the actor.
