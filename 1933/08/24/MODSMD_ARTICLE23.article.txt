# EQUINE GHOSTS HAUNT GOLF COURSE
## 
### 
Reminder of the beginnings of the
Palo Alto Farm, now the Stanford
campus, the horse cemetery, over on
Governor's avenue near the golf
course, is a spot of considerable local
historical interest.
Where the monument now stands was
the center of the activities of Governor
Stanford's famous trotting farm from
which went out many record-holders
v hich now lie buried there.
Across the road from the monument
are some brick stables, erected after a
fire in one of the wooden barns had
shown the need of fireproof structures
for some of the most valuable animals.
In the first days of the University the
trotting farm was still in operation, and
students used to visit it and admire the
intelligent, sensitive horses in their
stables and watch them being exercised
on the two tracks near by.
Famous Horses Buried
Senator Stanford had a number of
the most famous of his record-breakers
buried in the plot under oak trees op
posite these stables, and a number of
years ago Timothy Hopkins, a close
friends of Governor Stanford and now
the only surviving member of the ori
ginal board of trustees of the Univer
sity appointed by the Stanfords, pre
sented the University with the bronze

horse which stands on a high granite
pedestal to mark the old graveyard.
This horse, contrary to a common be
lief, is not a representation of any one
of the Stanford string. On the side of
the pedestal is a plaque with the names
and records of some of the outstanding
animals which carried the colors of the
Palo Alto Farm.
Governor Stanford was scientific in
the development of his trotters. A re
minder of one of his methods in this
direction is found in another bronze
tablet placed on a great granite slab
near the horse monument, commemor
ating the first experiments that led to
the motion picture industry.
Experimented in Photography
These experiments were devised by
Governor Stanford to give him photo
graphic evidence of the motions of a
trotter in action. He held theories,
gained from his own careful observa

tion, that were contrary to the gener
ally accepted beliefs. He engaged Ead
weard Muybridge, the leading photo
grapher of the Coast, who had made
considerable advances in camera tech
nique, to set up a series of cameras
alongside the trotting track, which took
successive instantaneous pictures of a
trotter as it passed by. Later, when
these pictures were projected on a
screen there was produced a brief mov
ing picture of the actual motions of the
horse. Muybridge took these to Europe
and created a sensation.
In the museum of the University is a
portrait of Stanford by the famous
artist, Beissonier, painted when the
Stanfords visited Europe, which shows
some of the photographs of horses in
motion under the Governor's hand.
Another evidence of Governor Stan
ford's science in the development of
his trotters was his "kindergarten
tracks," all evidence of which have now

disappeared. On these tiny tracks he
had his promising colts run while he
watched them closely, rejecting some
as prospects for great achievement and
studying how he could check and im
prove the gaits of others.
