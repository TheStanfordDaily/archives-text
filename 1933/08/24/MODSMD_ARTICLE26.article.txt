WANDERERS
There are lone wanderers without a shore;
The far horizons beckon—and they go,
They have a tryst with far-off places, so
They leave the friendly fire, the open door.
Strange seas are liveliness; they seek the store
Of unknown lands and wild unwinnowed seas;
Hearing a lonely call that will not cease
They leave to friends the reckoning and the score.
God send they find at last what most they crave!
Winds and the feathery sea, the silken surf
A kindlier shroud shall weave, a greener turf
Be nurtured by the kindly mother-wave.
Passing from earth to something ages keep
In promise where the unborn planets sleep.
—John C. Alamack
