# Moonbeams Chill Sleeping Sunner Atop Toyon Roof
## 
### 
Moonbeam bathing may become
a fad elsewhere, but judging from
the recent experience of a Stan
ford student, it is not likely to
attract favor here.
The other day one of Toyon's
residents, in accordance with
popular custom, stripped for a
session with Old Sol. Mounting
the steps to the roof he lay hap
pily upon the porch, and in time,
slipped into a sunny slumber.
As the "bather" lay wrapped in
blissful oblivion a janitor mount
ed the narrow steps to the roof.
Turning the key, he locked the
door leading down into the hall.
At 8 o'clock that evening,
aroused by a deep and pathetic
bellowing, students forced the
door open and, empty of stomach,
chilly of limb, but burnt of back,
the moonbeam bather descended.
