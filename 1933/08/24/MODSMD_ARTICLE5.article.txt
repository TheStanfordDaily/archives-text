Albert I. Elkus will give the last of
his series of lectures on music tonight
at 8 o'clock in the Little Theatre. These
lectures have dealt with the various
appeals of music, such as emotional ex
pression, design, the interweaving of
melodies, and the harmonic basis of
our musical forms. The title of the
fourth and final lecture is "The Fugue
of J. S. Bach."
Elkus has enjoyed a varied and in
teresting career in the field of music.
He graduated from the University of
California and went to Europe to con
tinue his musical career. He studied
with Fuchs and Prohaska in Vienna,
and with Schumann in Berlin; upon
his return to America Elkus continued
his work with Weil in San Francisco.
Elkus is now a member of the fac
ulty of the San Francisco Conservatory
of Music, and a lecturer in music at
the University of California and Mills
College. His special interest in the field
of music outside of classroom work is
orchestral composition.
Each of the * lectures in the series
has been illustrated with music of the
period, with reference to some lasting
quality of style which has become per
manent in the art of music.
