# Early Plans Revealed For Next Summer
## Interesting Academic And Recreational Program Planned 
### 
With three visiting faculty appoint
ments for next summer already com
pleted and others in process, Dr. Eliot
G. Mears, director of the summer quar
ter, is actively engaged in plans for
1934. "Stanford was very fortunate in
having an exceedingly good faculty this
summer. We shall try to duplicate it
next year," Mears said.
In addition to the regular courses,
1 which are being arranged now, Dr.
I Mears counts on a series of art and
music programs comparable to this
summer's and at least as many conven
tions and conferences as met on the
campus this year.
Decline Less Than Average
"The question of the size of the stu
dent body next year is, of course,
problematical," Dr. Mears says. "It de
pends to a large degree on the economic
situation next summer. If the enroll
ment in October is about normal, as is
hoped for, I see no reason why the
summer quarter figures next year
should not turn upward again.
"Stanford suffered a smaller propor
tion of loss in students this summer
than the average throughout the coun
try," Dr. Mears announced. "Satistics
I have just received from the Associa
tion of Deans and Directors of Summer
Sessions," he said, "show that Stan
ford's decline in numbers was less than
the average, and furthermore that only
three universities had an increase in
registration as compared with 1932.
These ihree, the University of Chicago,
the University of Minnesota, and New
York University, had very small per
centages of increase, each due to spe
cial reasons. The University of Chi
cago, in the year of the world's fair
there, had a 5 per cent increase."
599 Attend Session
The grand total of Stanford registra
tion for this summer fell just shor: of
600. "Figures from the Registrar's of
fice," he said, "give 459 men registered
and 140 women, a total of 599.
"The three visiting faculty men al
ready appointed for next summer," Dr.
Mears announced, "are in the field of
modern languages, all scholars in this
field, two of them from European uni
versities. They are Professor Angel
Gonzalez Palencia, University of
Madrid, in Spanish; Professor Camillo
von Klenze, University of Munchen,
who created a deep impression when
he taught here before, in German; and
Professor Gabriel Bonno, University of
California, in French." Other appoint
ments will be announced soon, Dr.
Mears says.
Of the music and art programs which
will be arranged, one has already been
announced. It is the series of six con
certs for the staff and student body of
the 1934 summer quarter by the Pro
Arte quartet, the gift of Mrs. Elizabeth
Sprague Coolidge.
