# STUDENTS OF MINE
## 
### 
From Edgar Eugene Robinson, head I
of the Stanford history department and
Margaret Byrne professor of history,
comes the final "Students of Mine" fea
ture for this summer's Daily.
In speaking of the Department of ,
History and its relation to the students
of the University, Robinson says: "All
students in the Lower Division take at
least one course in history; thus we
get to know a great many non-history
majors. Some of our best students have
been majoring in other departments,
and these students often go through our
whole series of courses.
"We do not have a great number of
majors graduating each year, and we
get to know them pretty well; not so
well, perhaps, as when we had them
for four years as majors, as we did
when I came here in 1911.
Many Graduate Degrees
"Our graduate work has increased
greatly in the last dozen years. Since
1893 we have granted the master's de
gree to about 250 and 25 have won the
doctor's degree in history. These gradu- |

! ates are now scattered over twenty
six states and five foreign countries. In
my period of service at Stanford
we have awarded the degree of doctor
of philosophy to such well-known
i scholars as Mary Williams of Goucher,
Paul Clyde of-Kentucky, Robert Bink
ley of Western Reserve, Oswald Wedel
of Arizona, and David Harris of our
own University.
"As for students of my own," Robin
son continues, "they are not, I suppose,
the 2800 who have taken the general
lecture course on 'Westward Move
men!,' but perhaps they are in a meas
ure at least the 220 who have taken
my seminars. Perhaps most of all would
be those who have written master's
theses under my direction. There are
55 theses on the shelf in my office, and
seven have taken the doctor's degree
with me.
Independent Students Interesting
"They include Dr. Edith Dobie of the
University of Washington, who wrote
! her dissertation from California ma-
terial in our library; Professor Francis
Guittard of Texas; Professor Embry M.
Gettys of Decatur Baptist College; also
Professor T. A. Bailey and Dr. H. W.
Bradley, now of our own department.
"In particular I remember Margaret
Bennett, who took a master's degree
in history and who has just published
a scholarly book on 'College and Life,'
and George Hodges, whose textbook
on 'Background of International Rela
tions' was published last year.
"Students graduating under the In
dependent Study Plan are particularly
interesting," says Professor Robinson.
"I have had a few in American History
in recent years: David Jacobson, Bev
erly McAnear, Mort Fuller, Lois Bailey,
Harry Winton, and Jack Kemble."

doctor's degree in history. These gradu- |

! ates are now scattered over twenty
six states and five foreign countries. In
my period of service at Stanford
we have awarded the degree of doctor
of philosophy to such well-known
i scholars as Mary Williams of Goucher,
Paul Clyde of-Kentucky, Robert Bink
ley of Western Reserve, Oswald Wedel
of Arizona, and David Harris of our
own University.
"As for students of my own," Robin
son continues, "they are not, I suppose,
the 2800 who have taken the general
lecture course on 'Westward Move
men!,' but perhaps they are in a meas
ure at least the 220 who have taken
my seminars. Perhaps most of all would
be those who have written master's
theses under my direction. There are
55 theses on the shelf in my office, and
seven have taken the doctor's degree
with me.
Independent Students Interesting
"They include Dr. Edith Dobie of the
University of Washington, who wrote
! her dissertation from California ma-
terial in our library; Professor Francis
Guittard of Texas; Professor Embry M.
Gettys of Decatur Baptist College; also
Professor T. A. Bailey and Dr. H. W.
Bradley, now of our own department.
"In particular I remember Margaret
Bennett, who took a master's degree
in history and who has just published
a scholarly book on 'College and Life,'
and George Hodges, whose textbook
on 'Background of International Rela
tions' was published last year.
"Students graduating under the In
dependent Study Plan are particularly
interesting," says Professor Robinson.
"I have had a few in American History
in recent years: David Jacobson, Bev
erly McAnear, Mort Fuller, Lois Bailey,
Harry Winton, and Jack Kemble."
From Edgar Eugene Robinson, head I
of the Stanford history department and
Margaret Byrne professor of history,
comes the final "Students of Mine" fea
ture for this summer's Daily.
In speaking of the Department of ,
History and its relation to the students
of the University, Robinson says: "All
students in the Lower Division take at
least one course in history; thus we
get to know a great many non-history
majors. Some of our best students have
been majoring in other departments,
and these students often go through our
whole series of courses.
"We do not have a great number of
majors graduating each year, and we
get to know them pretty well; not so
well, perhaps, as when we had them
for four years as majors, as we did
when I came here in 1911.
Many Graduate Degrees
"Our graduate work has increased
greatly in the last dozen years. Since
1893 we have granted the master's de
gree to about 250 and 25 have won the
doctor's degree in history. These gradu- |

! ates are now scattered over twenty
