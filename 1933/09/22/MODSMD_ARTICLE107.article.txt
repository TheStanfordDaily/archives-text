# SIDELINE SLANTS..
## Another Indian Varsity is "Back on the Farm” 
### 
BACK TO THE FARM may
sound like the caption over a car
toon in some three-cent laborite
newspaper to you and me, but it
means work—back-straining, bone
bruising work —to the hordes ol'
football men who arrived on Sep
tember 16 for their first season
under the official tutelage of Tiny
Thornhill. Despite the sickening
triteness of the nomen, it looks not
unlike a "new deal" in Stanford
football to what few hapless lorlu
nates have lingered hereabouts, thus
being spared a "back to the Farm"
migration.
Those captious cynics who
averred that Tiny would adopt
the dignified "Claude E." as the
fore-handle of his monicker have
by now taken up cutting paper
dolls in the sanctum of their pri
vate chambers. Tiny hasn't so
much as changed the dirty baser
ball cap of former gridiron sieges.
He still calls his work-horses by
their first names and still gets
down into the scrimmage line to
demonstrate his points, with
shoulder - buffeting effectiveness,
whenever necessary.
As for the players, none of them
seem to miss Pop Warner particu
larly, a noticeable fact which lends
some weight to the old rumor that
Thornhill was really the coach not
withstanding the newspaper head
lines. Maybe they always look that
way for a couple of games, but the
present herd of football men ap
pears to represent greater poundage
on theh hoof than have other In
dian squads within recollection of
the present Stanford generation.
A newspaper chattel usually gets
at least knee-deep in tepid water
when he attempts to describe the
"spirit" of a training-season football
team. Disregarding an inherent fear
of such fluid, at least one observer
is willing, nay eager, to state that
he has never before seen a Redshirt
squad taking its practice punish
ment any better than the present
turnout. The gridmen are working
hard, of course, but there is a cer
tain "what have we got to lose'" at
titude apparent in their demeanor.
It's novel, for Stanford, and who
knows? It might be the combina
tion which will win football games.
Thornhill and Nevers, knowing
-better than any others that Stan
lord has a group of alumni who
think the prestige of their Uni
versity depends upon the scores
of football games, are still man
aging to keep the wrinkles from
their brows. For them—an or
chid. but bettter than the Win
chellian variety. Everybody on
