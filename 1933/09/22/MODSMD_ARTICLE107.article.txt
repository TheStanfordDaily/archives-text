# SIDELINE SLANTS..
## Another Indian Varsity is "Back on the Farm” 
### 
BACK TO THE FARM may
sound like the caption over a car
toon in some three-cent laborite
newspaper to you and me, but it
means work—back-straining, bone
bruising work —to the hordes ol'
football men who arrived on Sep
tember 16 for their first season
under the official tutelage of Tiny
Thornhill. Despite the sickening
triteness of the nomen, it looks not
unlike a "new deal" in Stanford
football to what few hapless lorlu
nates have lingered hereabouts, thus
being spared a "back to the Farm"
migration.
Those captious cynics who
averred that Tiny would adopt
the dignified "Claude E." as the
fore-handle of his monicker have
by now taken up cutting paper
dolls in the sanctum of their pri
vate chambers. Tiny hasn't so
much as changed the dirty baser
ball cap of former gridiron sieges.
He still calls his work-horses by
their first names and still gets
down into the scrimmage line to
demonstrate his points, with
shoulder - buffeting effectiveness,
whenever necessary.
As for the players, none of them
seem to miss Pop Warner particu
larly, a noticeable fact which lends
some weight to the old rumor that
Thornhill was really the coach not
withstanding the newspaper head
lines. Maybe they always look that
way for a couple of games, but the
present herd of football men ap
pears to represent greater poundage
on theh hoof than have other In
dian squads within recollection of
the present Stanford generation.
A newspaper chattel usually gets
at least knee-deep in tepid water
when he attempts to describe the
"spirit" of a training-season football
team. Disregarding an inherent fear
of such fluid, at least one observer
is willing, nay eager, to state that
he has never before seen a Redshirt
squad taking its practice punish
ment any better than the present
turnout. The gridmen are working
hard, of course, but there is a cer
tain "what have we got to lose'" at
titude apparent in their demeanor.
It's novel, for Stanford, and who
knows? It might be the combina
tion which will win football games.
Thornhill and Nevers, knowing
-better than any others that Stan
lord has a group of alumni who
think the prestige of their Uni
versity depends upon the scores
of football games, are still man
aging to keep the wrinkles from
their brows. For them—an or
chid. but bettter than the Win
chellian variety. Everybody on
the practice field is playing it the
way," win or lose.
Whether the varsity wins or
Icses, Stanford has a 1933 football
team of which it may be proud.
The game's the thing, and the
sooner the Stanford student group
realizes it.the better, for the
pleasures of winning are fleeting,
the benefits of playing everlast
ing.

To get down to personalities, the
daily gruel of the avid sports fan,
there is that highly problematic In
dian first string. As these words
penetrate a time-worn typewriter
ribbon, the campus, or what there
is of it, awaits the opening game
against San Jose State. Thornhill
has named the following for open
ers: Moscrip, Palamountain, Kite,
Bates, Corbus, Lettunich, Norgard,
Sim, Maentz, White, and Hillman.
But that line-up doesn't mean
a thing. Look for plenty of Pack
ard, Monsalvc, O'Connor, Tarver,
Blanchard, Hohverda, Drown, Af
flerbaugh, and Van Dcllcn in that
Indian team.
The foregoing prediction does not
take into account the recruits from
that freshman "wonder team'" of
1932. There are several sophomores
who will, in all probability, strike
the sports writers' fancy this fall.
For example: Hoos, a canny little
quarterback; Hamilton, already
hailed as one of the "naturals" of
Stanford's football history, a half
back; the great Grayson, from Port
land, of all places; Alustiza, the
wizard quick-kicker; Reisner, a
phantom half; and Leedy, man
about-the-backfield.

But the Pacific Coast Conference
looks tougher than ever this year.
Southern California's Trojans, un
defeated in twenty games, seem to
be stronger than ev&r. California
appears to be destined for its best
season under the Ingram regime.
U.C.L.A. is coming into its own,
after its debut (U.C.L.A. 13-Stan
f< id 6) last year. Washington's Hus
kies look still huskier. Eastward
and odd thousand miles, Northwcst

err, always presents a tough prob
lem to the Big Ten.
Stanford's varsity, despite its
potentialities of greatness, will do
well to win three of these five
major games. But when, in the
tenseness of the closing minutes
of play, the froufrou of Indian and
Golden Bear silk-clad athletes
becomes audible in the topmost
row of the Stadium, the Big Game
crowd will admit that Stanford s
team of '33 is fit to wear the Car
dinal.
