# Inexperienced Frosh Eleven Opens Grid Season
## INJURIES HURT BABE CHANCES IN FIRST GAME 
### 
With prep stars gathered from all
sections of the country, Coach James
"Rabbit" Bradshaw has spent the
last week endeavoring to mold a
frosh grid eleven for the present
season that will continue the un
defeated record set by the class
of '36.
However, though the future
Cardinal stars have been plucked
from leading high school football
teams from Pennsylvania to Ha
waii, lack of experience, untimely
injuries, and a great abundance
of lightweights make a repeat of
last season's record quite im
probable.
Today's game with San Mateo
Junior College starts the freshmen
oft against a team that has been
practicing for nearly a month and
have already turned in a 19-0 vic
tory over San Francisco State
Teachers College. The frosh will be
outweighed around 10 pounds to the
man and meet practically the same
outfit that gave last season's Babes
one of their hardest contests.
Four good ends greeted Coach
Bradshaw on the opening day of the
practice out of a total turnout of
over 75 candidates. One of them
immediately w&nt on the injured
list with a weak knee. This was Jim
Reynolds, another Kiski prep star
who selected Stanford for a future
tramping ground.
Other ends are Carl Shott and
Harold Elder from San Francisco
who weighed in at 175 and 165
pounds respectively, and Bob Jenk
ins of Honolulu at 170 pounds.
Tackles and guards are a little
heavier than the ends but good
reserves are quite scarce. Lewis
Toustousvas of Santa Barbara is
the heaviest at 200 pounds with
Dale Beedle of Miami, Arizona
weighing about 190. Beedle was
highly recommended by Ted Ship
key and in the few days of prac
tice has lived up to advance
notices. Tom Kiddie, a guard
from South Pasadena, jhas also
shown up well in practice.
Outstanding among the candidates
for the center position have been
George Bergman of Englewood and
Ralph Quails of Bakersfield. Both
weigh 170 pounds.
