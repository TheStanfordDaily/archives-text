# VETERANS RETURN TO BRIGHTEN BALL OUTLOOK FOR '34
## 
### 
With the return of more than a
full team of lettermen, prospects of
regaining the intercollegiate base
bail championship from California
look bright for Stanford's 1934
squad. Coach Harry Wolter's Cards
finished in second place last year,
when the Bears ran up an impres
sive total of eight victories and one
defeat.
Present indications point to a
well-rounded mound staff; Fred
Heringer, Harry Stark, and
"Lefty" Campbell all coming back
for duty. A trick knee that will
keep Stan Anderson off the grid
iron this fall is Wolter's gain as
this ace hurler of two years ago
will be able to devote his full
time to pitching. Jim Massey, two
year letterman, will replace Cap
tain Ike Liverinore behind the bat.
Gordy Mallatratt and Art Hearn,
both lottermen, will battle it out
again for first base and Sophomore
Bob Grayson, if he doesn't go out
for track, will give them added com
petition. Jim Woolley returns to his
post at the keystone sack ar.d Jerry
Trautman will hold down the hot
corner for his third year, if he finds
time from his duties as A.S.S.U.
proxy.
The one big problem facing the
Indian mentor at present is locating
a good man to fill the hole leit at
shortstop by the graduation of Bert
Delmas, league - leading batsman
last season. Ray Forsythe, letter
man, or Chuck Clancy, reserve, may
get the job.
Captain-elect Dick Miles, who
batted his way into fourth place in
the league averages last year, will
be pulling them down in the right
garden and Fred Maggiora, out for
football at present, will probably
k ke over the center orchard. For
sythe may occupy left field, but
Neuman, Nutting, "Monk" Moscrip
or "Bones" Hamilton may land reg
ular berths. And there is the ru
mor ihat little Lenny Goldmann,
