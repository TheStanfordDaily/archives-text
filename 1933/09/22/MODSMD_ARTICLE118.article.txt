# â€™Dink' Forecasts Need of Runners for Track Team
## 
### 
Weakness in sprints and middle
distance events will be hig handicap
to overcome this year if Coach
"Dink" Templeton's track and field
cchorts expect to repeat their vic
tory of last spring over Dean Crom
well's Trojans. The supremacy ol
U.S.C. over the Cardinal for the past
years received a setback last May
when the Indians eked out a 67-64
win the first of two Stanford U.C.
dual meets, but El Trojan wan the
second encounter and closed the rea
son with a narrow squeak over the
Caids in the I.C. 4-A's at Cambridge.
Whither Dink's 1934 edition can
shut out the threat from the south
tiiis spring is problematical. Art
Rice and Jimmy Willson are the
only sprinters on hand with the
remote possibility that "Monk"
Moscrip, Johnny Reisner and
Bobby Grayson may forsake base
ball and rugby for the cinder
path.
A 1 Blackman and "Truck" Del
linger in the 440 and Dan Murphy in
the 830 appear to be the only pros
pects right now for the middle dis
tances, but big things are expected
of Blackman.
Chuck Nimmo, the sensational
captain of the Papoose squad last
y?ar, is counted on to lead the Tro
jan millers to the tape, and he may
be called on to repeat in the two
mile, although Olie Amdahl, who
recovered from his last year's
injuries, and Art Azevedo may need
little aid in the latter event.
A wealth of material awaits
Dink in the hurdles. Captain Cus
Meier is expected to lead the
coast's best in the high sticks and
Sam Klopstock and Hunt Kings
bury of last year's freshman team
will be on hand to pick up ail
sorts of points in either the lows
oi highs.

In the field events, Stanford as
usual has u variety of talent. Johnny
Mottram, one of the best javelin
men in the country, will be flinging
the spear into the far reaches again.
L'oyd Schwesn, the come-through
surprise of the first Stanford-S.C.
meet will be the pick* of the Card
entries in the high jump, assisted
by Howard "Bird-legs" Arthur and
Don Albertson.
Paul Zaches and Phil Williams
will be seen scuffing up the saw
dust in the broad-jump pit, and Bud
Deacon should take the pole vault
in anybody's meet all season if in
juries don't return to bother him.
Johnny Lyman and "Slinger" Dunn
will easily monopolize thing.? in the
shot put, and if the Slinger has got
ten his growth and no one breaks
his arm in football practice this fall,
Stanford should pick up live points
in the discus with monotonous reg
ularity.
Pre-scason dope on freshman
prospects is few and far between
at present writing, although Fred
Williams and Voighl, both from
Colorado, carry reputations of
quite a pair of sprinters. Williams
is holding down a berth on Rab
bit Bradshaw's yearling elcvep at
present, and has been clocked at
!i.B.
To carry on Stanford's name as a
producer of great shot putters, the
arrival of Jim Reynolds of Los An
geles and Dale Beedle of Arizona,
ncction with the iron pellet is eaus
who have considerable fame in con
ing additional jubilation among the
track fans.
