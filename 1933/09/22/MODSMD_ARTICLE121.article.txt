# Today's Stanford Described
## 
### 
I To sco Stanford is to want to
'know Stanford—its people, its cam
i pus, its institutions; all of them, in
! their many moods with the varied
l seasons of the year.
The Stanford of today, which
! Stanford alumni are invited to re
! visit this year with the "Back to the
J Farm" movement of 1933-34, is truly
I a campus that can boast of countless
| features to interest the visitor who
| comes back to see once again the
1 spots lhat hold many invaluable
■ memories.
j To those who knew the Stanford
ot yesterday, to the parents of the
Stanford men and women of today,
and most especially to those who are
| entering the University for the first
time this autumn, the followhl|* de
' script ion of some of the outstanding
campus buildings is presented.
Main Quadrangles
The central g'-oup of buildings,
| constituting the two quadrangles
which one first sees while driving
j into the campus on Palm Drive, is
1 an adaptation of the mission archi
tecture, especially that of San Juan
j Capistrano.
Open arches, long colonnades, the
! rod-tile roofing of the old Spanish
; missions of early California—ihey
! arc all there, reproduced on a most
imposing scale. To view them at
, nipht—casting long, grotesque shad
ows under the light of the full moon
j —is to wonder dubiously if the sun
I itself at high noon can do justice to
! their beauty.
Inner Quad
The Inner Quadrangle consists of
12 one-story buildings and the Me
' morial Church, connected by a con
tinuous open arcade, and surround
ing a court 580 feet long by 246 feet
! wide, or three and a quarter acres.
The buildings are buff sandstone,
! somewhat varied in color, the stone
| work of broken ashlar, with rough
i rock face, and the roofs are covered
! with red tile.
The 14 buildings of the Outer
; Quadrangle are constructed of the
'same material and in the same gen
, oral style as the Inner Quadrangle,

with open arcades on the outside.
The extreme length of the Outer
Quadrangle is 894 feet.
The Lcland Stanford Junior Mu
s< am, a spot that proves to hold a
continued fascination for even the
regular members of the campus
community, is situated a quarter of
a mile from the quadrangles, on the
west side of Palm Drive, the avenue
to Palo Alto. Behind it is the An
atomy Building.
Chemistry, Engineering
The Chemistry Building is away
Irom the main group of structures
and is located between the quad
rangles and the Museum, ft consists
of two Separate units—the main
building and the Physical Chemical
Laboratory.
South of the Quad are located the
workshops of the Engineering de
partments, experimental laborato
ries, etc.. and the Department of
Military Science and Tactics with
its munitions, guns, and tanks.
Encina, Toyon, and Branner Halls,
. ituated east of the quadrangles, and
Sequoia Hall, west of the quad
rangles, are the dormitories for men.
Encina will normally accommodate
4. r >o students and is the freshman
hall. Toyon and Branner care for
150 men each, and Sequoia, 100.
Jloble Hall, situated southwest of
(lit! quadrangles, near Lake Lagu
nita, is the traditional women's dor
mitory and for the first time this
year will not be the only one. It
will accommodate 226 students. The
Stanford Union extension, com
pleted in 1922, has in the past ac
commodated about 100 men but this
year will house approximately 75
women. It includes a public dining
room and cafeteria.
Encina Dining Hall, consisting of
one central kitchen and eight sep
arate dining rooms, furnishes eating
accommodations for 550 men.
Men's Gym
Encina Gymnasium, for men, is a
long, rambling brick building with
a frontage of 330 feet, situated north
of Encina Hall and near the athletic
fields. There are two main divisions,

I separated by a small court. The
a rill hall is 120 by 05 feet, with hard
maple floor. There are rooms for
special exercises, medical rooms,
showers and locker rooms in each
wing, ample offices, and spacj for
storage of laundry. There is a sport
ing goods store maintained by the
Board of Athletic Control which
provides the best merchandise on
the market for the convenience of
Stanford men. Three outdoor swim
ming pools, and adjacent tennis
courts and athletic fields are avail
able to all men.
The Pavilion, located south of En
ema Gymnasium, is a building of
brick and stone construction afford
ing ample quarters for basketball
games, with a gallery seating capa
city of 2,700.
The famed Stanford Stadium is a
bowl-shaped structure built on an
earth embankment and has a seat
ing capacity of 88,000. The field in
cludes a quarter mile track and 220-
yard straightaway.
Unusually attractive for this type
of structure and boasting a pleasant
patio court between its two main
wings, Roble Gymnasium, for wo
men, is a recent project built with
funds supplied by the Stanford
Board of Athletic Control.
The building consists of four units,
grouped about the central court, and
an outdoor swimming pool. It is lo
cated on the north side of Santa
Teresa Street about 300 feet west of
! its intersection with Lomita Drive,
directly across the street from Roble
Hall and the area set aside for lu
ture dormitories for women.
The main pavilion is 60 by 110
feet, with a specially designed spring
floor; the impressive dance studio is
tiO by 90 feet, and the administration
wing, 280 by 48. The shower and
dressing room wing is 50 by 235
feet, and a smaller pavilion, 21 by
42, provides additional space for in
door games. The administration
wing includes a lounge, with con
nected kitchen, three small class
rooms, and offices for the Women's
' Athletic Association, in addition to

office for the staff. Of reinforced
concrete construction, the building
has tile roofs and cost approxima
tely $240,000.
The Thomas Welton Stanford Art
Gallery, the first building of the
proposed second quadrangle group,
was a gift of Thomas Welton Stan
ford, one tol the founders of the Uni
versity. It includes four galleries!
designed for the exhibition of paint
ings; and other works of art, and is
.south of the Library.
The Library Building itself is the
central unit in the second quad
rangle group and is situated between
Thi first quadrangle and the Encina- ;
Toyon-Branner dormitory group, set
back by a semi-circular drive from
Lasuen Street. The ground floor
provides a reading-room for the
Hoover War Library* which con
tains invaluable first-hand inlorma- i
tion of the World War of 1914. Also
including the Lane Medical Library |
;<nd the Law Library, the Univer
sity libraries contain over 540,000
volumes.
The Harris J. Ryan High-Voltage 1
Laboratory is located in the foot
hills about one-half mile south of |
May fie Id Avenue and distant from
the quadrangle about one and one
half miles in a southeasterly direc
tion. The main laboratory is 173
feet long by 60 feet wide, with a I
clearance of 50 feet from the floor j
to the lowest roof truss.
The entire south side of the build
ing can be opened by means of huge '
doe rs 42 feet by 46 feet, in order to
permit clearance of 21 feet in all di
rections for the high-voltage trans
mission lines which pass out of the
building on this side and extend for j
a distance of approximately one-half
mile in a southerly direction. The
laboratory is equipped with the
largest transformer set ever con
structed, with a capacity of 2,100,000
volts. The building and equipment,
costing approximately $314,000, were
financed throjjgh' gifts from the
leading light and power companies j
and manufacturers of electrical
equipment.

I To sco Stanford is to want to
'know Stanford—its people, its cam
i pus, its institutions; all of them, in
! their many moods with the varied
l seasons of the year.
The Stanford of today, which
! Stanford alumni are invited to re
! visit this year with the "Back to the
J Farm" movement of 1933-34, is truly
I a campus that can boast of countless
| features to interest the visitor who
| comes back to see once again the
1 spots lhat hold many invaluable
■ memories.

which one first sees while driving
j into the campus on Palm Drive, is
1 an adaptation of the mission archi
tecture, especially that of San Juan
j Capistrano.
Open arches, long colonnades, the
! rod-tile roofing of the old Spanish
; missions of early California—ihey
! arc all there, reproduced on a most
imposing scale. To view them at
, nipht—casting long, grotesque shad
ows under the light of the full moon
j —is to wonder dubiously if the sun
I itself at high noon can do justice to
! their beauty.
Inner Quad
The Inner Quadrangle consists of
12 one-story buildings and the Me
' morial Church, connected by a con
tinuous open arcade, and surround
ing a court 580 feet long by 246 feet
! wide, or three and a quarter acres.
The buildings are buff sandstone,
! somewhat varied in color, the stone
| work of broken ashlar, with rough
i rock face, and the roofs are covered
! with red tile.
The 14 buildings of the Outer
; Quadrangle are constructed of the
