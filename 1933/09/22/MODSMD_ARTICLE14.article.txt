# CHAPARRAL RATE DROPS TO $1
## 
### 
Despite inflation, N.R.A., and gen
eral price-boosting policies, Chapar
ral, campus monthly comic, yester
day announced a drastic reduction
in its subscription price and single
copy rates for the 1933-34 publica
tion year.
'I tic former yearly rate of two
dollars for the nine issues has been
slashed in half—one dollar for nine
hilarious Chappies. Fifteen cents
will buy a single copy, for which
iterations of Stanford roughs
have had to shell out two-bits. As
usual. Chappie salesgirls will be
on hand at the Administration
Building on Registration Day to
take subscription orders at the
price.
Just what caused the terrific drop
in price remains a matter of con
jecture. When approached for a
.statement, Old £>03 J; mes Algar re
fused l<> comment other than to say
tli-it the tirst i sue, "On the Boat,"
will come off the press on October
12 and will he fairly reeking with
traditional fun, merriment and
"jokes." Hell, heh.
Robert de Roos, penny-pinching
overseer of the Chappie ledgers, had
little more to say on the new price
11:-Is. He merely sneered and then
balked out a summons for all those
interested in trying-out for the
business staff. "Women too, ' he
added, with a smirk.
