## Al Peache Outlines System To Be Used; Asks That All Learn Hymn 
### 
j Following the announcement that
i there will be an organized rooting
section on September 30 at the U.C.
L.A. game for those who throng
j back to the campus early this year,
i today finds the Indian griddeis busy
getting ready for the war-path at
the hope of making up for the 13-6
defeat at the hands of the Bruins
last year.
Already laying ambitious plans
for Stanford rooters this season,
head Yell Leader A 1 Peache and
his two new assistants, Jimmy
Triolo and Aylett Cotton, have
asked, that co-operation be the
keynote of the student body dur
ing the 1933-34 meetings.
For those who return in time'for
the Bruin fray, and present indica
tions point to a majority of the Farm
residents being on hand, Peache has
j Issued the following explanation of
the plan to be used this fall, with
complete directions provided espe
cially for newcomers to the Farm
"The only effective yell," he de
clares, 'Ms that yell which is well
timed. To be well-timed, a yell must
be given in perfect unison with ihc
motions of the yell leaders." Peache
asks that all Stanford rooters ob
-1 serve the following simple rules for
best results.
(1) Know the yells thoroughly.
(2) All strat on the first syllable,
and watch the yell leaders.
(Hj Keep n, t, snap it ml at
the correct time b> following the
motions, and force the syllables out
—don't drag them.
(4) Save your voice by pitching it
up and forcing the sound against
your teeth.
(5) Please allow the yell lead 'l - to
do the talking. There's plenty of
I time to yell, so save your breath.
(6) Don't boo, or shout cat-calls
at anybody.
j (7) Sit well Jined-up in straight
! rows, and wear a white shirt if pos
| sible. The effect is much better.
(8) If you want anything, ask the
man in the Red Cap. But don't ar
gue with the Rally Committee. They
are at the games to help you, not. to
! act as a debating squad.
ffl) LEARN TIIE lIYMN! It will
be sung after every game, regard
less of whether we win or lose.
Every Stanford rooter will be ex
pected to stay until the Hymn has
been sung, Peache declared. A
copy will be found elsewhere hi
