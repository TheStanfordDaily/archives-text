all joined with other campus progressives to make the 19311-34 year a
banner one in Stanford student government.

' Asking ftr ""en a more friendly

always been noted for, Trautman led
the move this week with the dec
laration that every possible effort
will be expended this fall to make
the campus as interesting and en
tertaining as possible for its resi
dents.
As wheels were set in motion to
carry out this idea, all undergrad
uate were asked to become actively
interested in at least one extra
curicular activity and to excel bi
that particular interest. It whs
pointed out that the recreation pro
vided by an avocation as suggested
aids in the long run in keeping onn
fit for intensive studying when there
is work to be done.
Both Trautman and Hablcs weir
joined by Jeanne Millard, A.W> :
president and Chairman of,
Women's Council, in warning
the regular work of 'hflgHr

ner in the furtherance of oijt
interests.

for a banner year in scholasfh
