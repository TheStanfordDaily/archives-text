# Back To The Farm

### 
"I urn LfoiiiLf 'hack to the farm,' "is the traditional an
lunm reaction. And because 'back to the farm' has national
agrarian significance, we laugh being pleased at our own
ense of humor. That is ordinary self-esteem and is accept
able as such.
Hut il doesn't go far enough. Hack to the farm we must
go in order lo participate in lliat grand orgy of organized
disorder registration. Physically, you must come back.
Hut a Stanford quarter lliat begins with a $11 1 check from
home and ends with finals is a pretty drab thing. Il is fu
ll!/' even when you go through the motions of going to class
and attending the football games.
Hack to the farm should be a spiritual ideal as well as
a physical reality. And spiritual has nothing to do with
night-downed figures floating over a crystal ball in an eery
liglil. II you bring only your bodily hulk to the farm, you
bring little. And bringing little, you will find less. You
would do much better lo make mud pies in your own back
yard and save your $144.
As a place lo change clothes, the University is not the
best. I lie Hurlingame Country (Hub is closer to San Fran
cisco and has better valet service to boot. If you make the
Campus only your bed-room; if you make all classes an
enforced burden; and studying a rare experience, Stanford
will mean little to you and you will mean less to it.
lo the thousands of visitors who come to gawk at our
Qu'ad, it is an orderly mass of brown sandstone and red
life. Il is just that and no more to those that use the Uni
versily as a resting place between week-ends. If it is to
mean more, you must do more.
A student activity is the most obvious way to become a
part of the University in the spiritual sense. Hv helping to
create something better at the Campus or destroying some
filing that is fossilized, you build up yourself as a part of
Stanford.
Hut a round of extra-curricular activities and nothing
more is not enough. While gridirons loom large and Daily
oHices loom large (to the staff), (here are also classrooms.
II you come out of duly, the lectures are deadening. They
are I airly fatal at times even when you are interested in
the subject. Thev can only have meaning if you furnish a
purpose for having them at all.
So it's back to the farm—body and soul. Forgetting of
ourse the amorous connotation that the song writers and
ovie directors have given the phrase.

"I urn LfoiiiLf 'hack to the farm,' "is the traditional an
lunm reaction. And because 'back to the farm' has national
agrarian significance, we laugh being pleased at our own
ense of humor. That is ordinary self-esteem and is accept
able as such.
Hut il doesn't go far enough. Hack to the farm we must
go in order lo participate in lliat grand orgy of organized
