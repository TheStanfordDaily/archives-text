'I ho freshman in I lie movies comes to college miserable
<>!' son! and fearful of life. Some universities seek to per
petuate Iliat an!i<|uated notion by various adolescent
slunls.
Thus one very nolorious institution makes its first year
men bow down before a bronze statue. This is said to at
one stroke instill school spirit and at the same time show
the freshmen their proper inferiority. At some colleges
self-important sophomores (with wooden paddles) see to
il that freshmen wear foolish regalias or live up to embar
rassing regulations.
This bunk is unknown at Stanford. For pure bunk it is.
For by what magic can a "crawling" freshman be trans
formed into a "soaring" sophomore in one year? On the
beliVf in that magic, hazing is instituted. This bunk is 1111-
1 Mown at Stanford.
When you are admitted to the University, you enter as
i members of the Stanford family. The rest of the stu
nt body is here to help and advise. You are not paddled
or shamed into taking the advice. You are an equal. The
advice is yours to consider. Then, accept it or discard it.
As nn equal, you have responsibilities. You are men
and women in a great enterprise Stanford University.
You are expected to do your part. If you accept equality
and fail to meet its demands, you are not playing the Stan
lord game. You are a chiseler.
As a #hiscler, nothing very serious will happen to you.
You will not be paddled or dumped in the lake. That's not
done ;it Stanford. That is the way to discipline children.
Stanford considers its freshmen as equal to everyone else.
Stanford welcomes the class of as members at our
rouiyl bible not under il.
