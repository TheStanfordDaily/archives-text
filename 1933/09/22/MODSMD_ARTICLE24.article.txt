Carl Oliver is dead.
On August .'JO lie came to lake his customary place be
hind Ihe linotype machine. Twenty minutes later, he was
dead. He died simply and quickly. That is the way lie
would have wanted it.
Carl was hired as ;i linotype operator. But he was more
than that, lie had a deep interest in the Daily and a keen
appreciation of the weaknesses of the students that were
writing it. He rectified their mistakes and covered up their
blunders. Few knew it.
And Carl smiled. He was always smiling when lie
\\*rkcd in Ihe Daily's "back-room." He was smiling at col
legians rushing to meet the deadline with a deadly serious
ness that is youth's. He entered into their game and played
il with them.
For ten years he walked down the little walk that leads
to Hie presses. He walked passed the editorial offices with
jii understanding nod and a chuckling eye for each "jour
nalist" hunched over his typewriter in the best metropoli
tan style.
And now C.arl is gone. A new hand turns out the news
slugs in his place. The slugs will be the same. The Daily
will go on. The Daily will not be the same for Carl won't
be there.
Hut when a newspaperman dies, one is supposed to say,
