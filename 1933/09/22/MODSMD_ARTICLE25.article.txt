SONS OF THE STANFORD RED
Sons of the Stanford red,
Fight for your Alma Mater;
Fight for the fame of the Stanford
name —
Undaunted forge ahead.
Hearts that are brave and true,
Down with the gold and blue;
Shoulder to shoulder, fight and win,
Sons of the Stanford red.

HAIL. STANFORD, HAIL!
(The Hymn)
Where the rolling foothills rise
Up toward mountains higher,
Where at eve the Coast Range lies
In the sunset fire,
Flushing deep and paling,
Here we raise our voices, hailing
Thee, our Alma Mater.
Refrain
From the foothills to the bay,
It. shall ring,
As we sing,
It shall ring and float away.
Hail, Stanford, Hail!
Hail, Stanford, Hail!
Tender vistas ever new
Through the arches meet the eyes,
Where the red roof rims the skies
Flicked with cloudlets sailing,
Here we raise our voices, hailing
Thee, our Alma Mater.

THE TROJAN HORSE
In the days of along ago, the mighty
Trojan host
Held that they were the warriors
supreme;
But a little wooden horse upset their
haughty boast,
And their glory was only a dream.
Now, the Trojans have a namesake
down at Southern Cal,
And they're boastful as boastful
can be;
But they're goin' to meet their mas
ter, for the Cardinal
Will play horse with U.S.C.
