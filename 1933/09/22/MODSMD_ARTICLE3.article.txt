# Varsity Set For Bruin Battle
## 'Big Red Machine’ Gathers Momentum Under New Driver Bill Sim Indicated As Head Chauffeur Prospect; Corbus Appears Secure at Guard Post; Thirteen 1932 Lettermen Gone

dications point to a long and tough
j journey with a better than average
I chance of a successful trip.
It seems to be fairly definite
that Bill Sim is going to officiate
as head chauffeur when the con
traption gets going places tomor
row, and those "in the know"
I claim that Sim, ready to tear
things loose from the quarterback
post, is going to be a lot more

I the blond menace al half was in

In the event that names mean
i anything, we find nn all-Arm rican
unit of the new streamline variety
i in the person of Bill Corbus at the
[ right guard job; one of the lew who
I appear scheduled to stay put.
For the present, a survey of the
■ intricate mechanism reveals the fol
j lowing situation on the Farm.
H) Thirteen lcttermen, includ
ing six 19:52 regulars, are missing
from this season's lineup.
(2) Twelve lettermen, including
| five 1JKJ2 regulars, arc already in
the race with the now famous
1 sophomore sensations for posts on
the varsity.
I (3) The backficld problem to
' date lias been one of selection
more than anything else. There
has been a wealth of ball-toting
material available.
(4) The line problem, particu
larly at the tackle positions, is
turning out to be an experimen
tal situation, with prospects bet
ter than early predictions indi
cated.
The next pertinent fact to the
case in hand lies in the U.C.L.A.
contest a week from tomorrow. The
Uclans are pointing for the Indians
this year, and they don't even mean
1 perhaps.
The Westwood campus is plas
tered with "Beat Stanford" and "On
to Stanford" pennants, and a news
item from the South declares that
the Bruin rooters at the game will
greatly outnumber the Stanford
supporters. It is reported that no
less than five special trains have
already been filled for the week
end.
Stanford came out on the tail
end of a 13-6 score in last year's
encounter, and Thornhill is anx
ieus to remedy tins error. And
his pigskin carriers arc no less
determined.
As things stand just at present,
Jack Hillman has managed to keep
the regular job at fullback away
from the able clutches of Bobby
rGayson and Frank Alustiza in thai
order. All three are dynamite with
a ball in their hands.
Bob Maentz at left half and Chuck
White in the right position com
plete the tentative "regular" back
field. But Johnny Reisner, Kenny (
Afflerbaugh, Bob Reynolds, Earl
Hoos, and Buck Van Dellen are out
to change this setup.
Jim Moscript at left end; Ben!
Palamountain or Jack Brown, left |
tackle; Ted Kite or Bob O'Connor. 1
left guard; Billl Bates or Les Blan
chard, center; Ed Lettunich, light
tackle; and A 1 Norgard, left end—
these constitute the principal cogs
in the rest of the machcinery that
is still under the hood.

Today the Red Bandwagon is still
an experiment. Tomorrow it gets
it'- first trial lun. If Thornhill can
show a good, dependable line with
strength on offense and determina
tion on defense, the flashy backfield
will have a chance to demonstrate
some fancy speed and skill in ball
toting to good advantage.
If the line should happen to fail
in these respects, the backfield
won't be able to get very far in
the face of some good opposition.
San Jose State College, according
to Coach Dud deGroot, will pro
vide a large amount of this com
petition. And I)ud should know.

I worth surviving from hist year's
; Machine, 1933's untried experiment
has been officially pronounced as
being all tuned up and raring to
'go. Just where it is going is a mat
ter of conjecture—and hope. All in
dications point to a long and tough
j journey with a better than average
I chance of a successful trip.
It seems to be fairly definite
that Bill Sim is going to officiate
as head chauffeur when the con
traption gets going places tomor
row, and those "in the know"
I claim that Sim, ready to tear
things loose from the quarterback
post, is going to be a lot more
i trouble for the opposition than.
I the blond menace al half was in
I last year's Big Game.
In the event that names mean
i anything, we find nn all-Arm rican
unit of the new streamline variety
i in the person of Bill Corbus at the
[ right guard job; one of the lew who
I appear scheduled to stay put.
For the present, a survey of the
■ intricate mechanism reveals the fol
j lowing situation on the Farm.
H) Thirteen lcttermen, includ
ing six 19:52 regulars, are missing
from this season's lineup.
(2) Twelve lettermen, including
| five 1JKJ2 regulars, arc already in
the race with the now famous
1 sophomore sensations for posts on
the varsity.
I (3) The backficld problem to
' date lias been one of selection
more than anything else. There
has been a wealth of ball-toting
material available.
(4) The line problem, particu
larly at the tackle positions, is
turning out to be an experimen
tal situation, with prospects bet
ter than early predictions indi
cated.
The next pertinent fact to the
case in hand lies in the U.C.L.A.
contest a week from tomorrow. The
Uclans are pointing for the Indians
this year, and they don't even mean
1 perhaps.
The Westwood campus is plas
tered with "Beat Stanford" and "On
to Stanford" pennants, and a news
item from the South declares that
the Bruin rooters at the game will
greatly outnumber the Stanford
supporters. It is reported that no
less than five special trains have
already been filled for the week
end.
Stanford came out on the tail
end of a 13-6 score in last year's
encounter, and Thornhill is anx
ieus to remedy tins error. And
his pigskin carriers arc no less
determined.
As things stand just at present,
Jack Hillman has managed to keep
the regular job at fullback away
from the able clutches of Bobby
rGayson and Frank Alustiza in thai
order. All three are dynamite with
a ball in their hands.
Bob Maentz at left half and Chuck
White in the right position com
plete the tentative "regular" back
field. But Johnny Reisner, Kenny (
Afflerbaugh, Bob Reynolds, Earl
Hoos, and Buck Van Dellen are out
to change this setup.
Jim Moscript at left end; Ben!
Palamountain or Jack Brown, left |
tackle; Ted Kite or Bob O'Connor. 1
left guard; Billl Bates or Les Blan
chard, center; Ed Lettunich, light
tackle; and A 1 Norgard, left end—
these constitute the principal cogs
in the rest of the machcinery that
is still under the hood.

Today the Red Bandwagon is still
an experiment. Tomorrow it gets
it'- first trial lun. If Thornhill can
show a good, dependable line with
strength on offense and determina
tion on defense, the flashy backfield
will have a chance to demonstrate
some fancy speed and skill in ball
toting to good advantage.
If the line should happen to fail
in these respects, the backfield
won't be able to get very far in
the face of some good opposition.
San Jose State College, according
to Coach Dud deGroot, will pro
vide a large amount of this com
petition. And I)ud should know.
