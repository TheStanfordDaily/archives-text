# TRANS â€“ ATLANTIC DEBATE ARRANGED WITH CAMBRIDGE
## 
### 
Getting back to the farm vocally,
and vociferously so, a veteran squad
iof Stanford debaters are already
| talking night and day in anticipa
| t'on of one of the heaviest forensic
| schedules that the. cardinal orators
I have ever had to face.
Negotiations have already lieen
opened to secure a trans-Atlantic
| radio debate with Cambridge Uni
versity, according to Lee
faculty adviser of the activity.
Dual debates with the University
of California will be conducted early
in the fall and will be followed by a
radio debate with Southern Califor
nia. Two Stanford men will then en
gage in a series of debates with a
number of junior colleges in a so
called "down-State debate tour."
Stanford will send a forensic
| squad to Canada this year to meet
I the University of British Columbia,
I and the Pacific Coast Forensic
j League will meet here this year.
| This gathering consists of the major
universities on the coast, and the
speakers in attendance will enter an
extemporaneous speaking contest,
an oratorical competition, and an
after dinner contest, to vie for the
championships of the Pacific Coast
in these lines.
San Quentin Meet
A special meet has been arranged
again with the squad from "Good
Old Jail," otherwise known as San
Quentin, and an "up-State J.C. tour"
will also be conducted. A suggestion
is being entertained to have the
Stanford undergraduates challenge
the grads of thirty years ago to de
bate the question, "Resolved, that
the Stanford students receive less
from college than they did thirty
years ago."
A squad of veteran debaters who
will return to active work on the
campus this fall includes Fred Bold,
Dick Van Wagenen, Rollin Wood
bury, James Minor, Andrew Bright,
Joseph Fessio, Robert Grantier,
Spencer Thompson, Mary-Katherine
Morris, Ronald Kay, Waldo Munday,
and several others.
Ask New Material
All who are interested in parti
cipating in this extra-curricular in
terest, whether on the campus for
the first time this year or not, will
find complete information in a per
sonal interview with Chapin in room
200 c, in the History Building.
