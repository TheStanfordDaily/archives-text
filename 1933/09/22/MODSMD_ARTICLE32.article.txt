The A.S.S.U. consists of a few
thousand men and women, student
body president, manager"—all tan
gled into one horrible mess of red
I ape. All of use, in one big happy
family. Center of wire-pulling ac
tivities for which a large office has
been provided. Some people call it
the Associated Students of Stanford
University.
The AXE will be a Big Shot again
this year when it makes its 1933
dtbut as the Big Game Trophy in
the Stanford Stadium. Born at Stan
ford, abducted by California, it grew
to manhood and has returned to the
parental bosom. Just getting to like
the old Farm.
The BAWL-OUT is just one of
those things that tells everybody
else where you got off at. The wages
of sin arc publicity, and you pay fif
teen cents for the privilege of read
ing this year's address and the re
sults of last quarter's beer busts.
Contains fraternity, sorority and
other handy phone numbers, and
appears near the end of October.
A CORSAGE is something totally
unheard of at Stanford. Pansies, vio
lets, or lillies—nb Stanford man ever
di.shes out for these. It's not merely
a tradition. It's a financial neces
sity.
DIE LUFT DER FRIEIIEIT WEHT
is the University motto which de
clares "Let the winds of freedom
blow." Some individuals have mis
interpreted the slogan as meaning
"Make all checks payable to Stan
ford University." But it's a good
motto just the same. Be a good boy
and you can do anything you want.
ENCINA HALL is the frosh dor
mitory and not half as bad as it's
cracked up to be. An excellent place
for a tomato or egg fight—but the i
funny thing is they're not permitted.
Has a beautiful lobby, remodeled
and sporting furniture a la ritz.
SEQUOIA is the home of the
Stanford Rough. It used to be the
girls' dormitory and now the he
men of the campus flock to its
sturdy beams. To the right of the
main Quad as you come up Palm i
Drive.
TOYON and BRANNER are the
two new men's dormitories that
boast all the most modern conven- !
iences and are to be found to the j
left of Encina and on that side of '

1 the Quad as one drives into the
campus. About three blocks from
the English Corner.
HOBLE used to be the only place
for women as far us dormitories
were concerned. But now they've
made the Union—traditional sanc
tuary of the law grad—into a sec
ond feminine abode. JUST A SLIP
OF THE TONGUE, but—the name
"Roble" in Spanish is a masculine
word—and "Encina" is one of those
feminine nouns. Yes, both are used
in reference to oak trees.
The FIVE HUNDRED as such just
aren't any more. For generations (at
li ast a couple) it has referred to the
number of women in the University.
Today it is remembered with a bit
of moisture in the eye, because at
least in the past we knew how many
we had. Today, nobody knows'. And
who cares?
"GORDY" is the affectionate title
placed on the head of one Gordon
Davis, campus police officer, by
those who have suffered at his
hands. He drives around in a shiny
white Ford roadster, and if you look
hard you can see him coming. Drive
slowly, park in the right places,
drink your ginger ale straight—and
he's a great pal.
"ROUGH" is a term once applied
to the University's he-men. Now in
most cases it is limited to portions
and he's a great pal.
The R.O.T.C. is the student unit
of Uncle Sam's artillery. With about
75 horses, some A-l army officers
for instructors, and some nice little
cannon, the boys have a great time
once a week. And there's the an
nual horse show, too, when the girls
come down to see Jimmy in his nice
new uniform. Everything's free—
even the uniform and the horses.
The TIME SCHEDULE is a little
folder that anyone can buy for ten
cents which tells which classes meet
where—but not why. After the" first
couple of weeks, they're rather easy
to figure out. Get one early and see
your advisor first.
The BOOKSTORE is a co-opera
iive shop where books, papers, type
writers, windshield stickers, etc.,
may be purchased at the same price
or higher than some place else in
town. It's across from the Union.
DROFNATS is a nom de plume

commonly adapted by local
writers who aren't overly anxious
about seeing their own
print. Don't be fooled. It's
"Stanford'' spelled backwards.

HOBLE used to be the only place
for women as far us dormitories
were concerned. But now they've
made the Union—traditional sanc

"Roble" in Spanish is a masculine
word—and "Encina" is one of those
feminine nouns. Yes, both are used
in reference to oak trees.

"GORDY" is the affectionate title
placed on the head of one Gordon
Davis, campus police officer, by
those who have suffered at his
hands. He drives around in a shiny
white Ford roadster, and if you look
hard you can see him coming. Drive
slowly, park in the right places,
drink your ginger ale straight—and
he's a great pal.
"ROUGH" is a term once applied
to the University's he-men. Now in
most cases it is limited to portions
and he's a great pal.
The R.O.T.C. is the student unit
of Uncle Sam's artillery. With about
75 horses, some A-l army officers
for instructors, and some nice little
cannon, the boys have a great time
once a week. And there's the an
nual horse show, too, when the girls
come down to see Jimmy in his nice
new uniform. Everything's free—
even the uniform and the horses.
The TIME SCHEDULE is a little
folder that anyone can buy for ten
cents which tells which classes meet
where—but not why. After the" first
couple of weeks, they're rather easy
to figure out. Get one early and see
your advisor first.
The BOOKSTORE is a co-opera
iive shop where books, papers, type
writers, windshield stickers, etc.,
may be purchased at the same price
or higher than some place else in
town. It's across from the Union.
DROFNATS is a nom de plume

commonly adapted by local
writers who aren't overly anxious

"Stanford'' spelled backwards.
The A.S.S.U. consists of a few
thousand men and women, student
body president, manager"—all tan

The AXE will be a Big Shot again
this year when it makes its 1933

The BAWL-OUT is just one of

town. It's across from the Union.
DROFNATS is a nom de plume

commonly adapted by local
writers who aren't overly anxious
about seeing their own
print. Don't be fooled. It's
"Stanford'' spelled backwards.
The A.S.S.U. consists of a few
thousand men and women, student
body president, manager"—all tan
gled into one horrible mess of red
I ape. All of use, in one big happy
family. Center of wire-pulling ac
tivities for which a large office has
been provided. Some people call it
the Associated Students of Stanford
University.
The AXE will be a Big Shot again
this year when it makes its 1933
dtbut as the Big Game Trophy in
the Stanford Stadium. Born at Stan
ford, abducted by California, it grew
to manhood and has returned to the
parental bosom. Just getting to like
the old Farm.
The BAWL-OUT is just one of
those things that tells everybody
else where you got off at. The wages
of sin arc publicity, and you pay fif
teen cents for the privilege of read
ing this year's address and the re
sults of last quarter's beer busts.
Contains fraternity, sorority and
other handy phone numbers, and
appears near the end of October.
A CORSAGE is something totally
unheard of at Stanford. Pansies, vio
lets, or lillies—nb Stanford man ever
di.shes out for these. It's not merely
a tradition. It's a financial neces
sity.
DIE LUFT DER FRIEIIEIT WEHT
is the University motto which de
clares "Let the winds of freedom
blow." Some individuals have mis
interpreted the slogan as meaning
"Make all checks payable to Stan
ford University." But it's a good
motto just the same. Be a good boy
and you can do anything you want.
ENCINA HALL is the frosh dor
mitory and not half as bad as it's
cracked up to be. An excellent place
for a tomato or egg fight—but the i
funny thing is they're not permitted.
Has a beautiful lobby, remodeled
and sporting furniture a la ritz.
SEQUOIA is the home of the
Stanford Rough. It used to be the
girls' dormitory and now the he
men of the campus flock to its
sturdy beams. To the right of the
main Quad as you come up Palm i
Drive.
TOYON and BRANNER are the
two new men's dormitories that
boast all the most modern conven- !
iences and are to be found to the j
left of Encina and on that side of '

1 the Quad as one drives into the
campus. About three blocks from
the English Corner.
HOBLE used to be the only place
for women as far us dormitories
were concerned. But now they've
made the Union—traditional sanc
tuary of the law grad—into a sec
ond feminine abode. JUST A SLIP
OF THE TONGUE, but—the name
"Roble" in Spanish is a masculine
word—and "Encina" is one of those
feminine nouns. Yes, both are used
in reference to oak trees.
The FIVE HUNDRED as such just
aren't any more. For generations (at
li ast a couple) it has referred to the
number of women in the University.
Today it is remembered with a bit
of moisture in the eye, because at
least in the past we knew how many
we had. Today, nobody knows'. And
who cares?
"GORDY" is the affectionate title
placed on the head of one Gordon
Davis, campus police officer, by
those who have suffered at his
hands. He drives around in a shiny
white Ford roadster, and if you look
hard you can see him coming. Drive
slowly, park in the right places,
drink your ginger ale straight—and
he's a great pal.
"ROUGH" is a term once applied
to the University's he-men. Now in
most cases it is limited to portions
and he's a great pal.
The R.O.T.C. is the student unit
of Uncle Sam's artillery. With about
75 horses, some A-l army officers
for instructors, and some nice little
cannon, the boys have a great time
once a week. And there's the an
nual horse show, too, when the girls
come down to see Jimmy in his nice
new uniform. Everything's free—
even the uniform and the horses.
The TIME SCHEDULE is a little
folder that anyone can buy for ten
cents which tells which classes meet
where—but not why. After the" first
couple of weeks, they're rather easy
to figure out. Get one early and see
your advisor first.
The BOOKSTORE is a co-opera
iive shop where books, papers, type
writers, windshield stickers, etc.,
may be purchased at the same price
or higher than some place else in
town. It's across from the Union.
