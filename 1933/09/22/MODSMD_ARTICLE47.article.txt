# Asks Support Of Honor Code
## 
### 
An appeal to students, new and
old, to help perpetuate Stanford's
Honor Code was voiced yesterday
by Emie Arbuckle of the Men's
Council, in the statement: "The
value and desirability of such a code
rests entirely upon its successful ap
plication. It is successful only if the
great majority of students is will
ing to adhere to it and is sufficiently
interested to bring to task the very
small minority which may violate
it."
Concerning that small minority,
Arbuckle stated that the Men's
Council is commissioned to ex
tinguish the group of violators,
but that an ideal condition would
include enough student opinion
to enforce <hd Code without heavy
penalties being inflicted."
To new students is directed the
message that they "will be doing
their part in contributing to its suc
cess when they sign the pledge of
'No unpermitted aid given or re
ceived,' and realize that adherence

.
to this pledge is expected. The ob
servance and appreciation of the j
Honor Code by freshmen is partic
ularly important, and first year men
will be counted on to continue its
administration."
The Women's Council serves in
'bp same capacity of enforcing the
Code among the women.
