## 
### 
Slashing the price of 1934 Quads
to a new standard of Editor
Al Sadler and Hal Whitfield, Busi
ness Manager, issued the joint
declaration yesterday to the effect
that in spite of the reduction in
cost, the next Stanford yearbook
will aim to surpass its predeces
sors both in quality of material
and content, wherever possible.
Seniors, who will have their sen
ior picture included with the cost
of the Quad itself, will pay $G.65, it
wu:; revealed. Both of the. above
quotations include the California
sales tax.
Sadler, in gathering his written
and photographic material to cover
every phase of campus activity, has
grouped his subjects into seven di
visions. They include: Administra
tion, Classes, Activities, The Stan
ford Year, Athletics, Living Groups,
and Razz.
Published entirely by students,
the Quad provides another oppor
tunity for those coming "Back to
the Farm" to interest themselves in
an interesting activity, according to
its editors. Editorial tryouts for
freshmen will be held during the
winter quarter, while about 10 soph
omores will be added to the staff at
the close of the autumn quarter.
Those interested are asked to con
tact either Al Sadler or Dorothy
Brown, managing editor, at the
Quad office in the Press Building.
Positions Open
Whitfield declared that there is
room on the business staff for those
interested in selling Quads, adver
tising, or doing general of five work.
Information may be secured at that
office as to tryouts later in October.
Four junior managerships and four
junior editorships are awarded to
successful sophomores at the end of
each year.
During recent years the Quad has
received the all-American award of
the National Scholastic Press Asso
ciation, the highest possible honor.
This year's book will be printed by
11. S. Crocker, who did the work in
]933, and Van Allan Haven, com
mercial artists of San Francisco, will
do the art work.
