# RAIL LINES REDUCE ROUNDTRIP TICKETS
## New Rate Is Available to College Travel 
### 
A substantial saving in round
trip railroad fares has been an
nounced by all passenger-carrying
railroads for Stanford men and
women this year.
Special tickets are available now
for students and faculty members
at only one and one-third the reg
ular oneway fare (as in effect
May 1. 1933) which permit the re
turn trip to be made anytime be
fore next June.
These round-trip tickets must be
purchased prior to registration day
and used immediately with no stop
over privileges allowed on the going
trip. However, the return trip may
be taken either at the winter or
spring vacations with stop-overs up
to a maximum return trip of 10 days
being permitted. If the ticket is used
again at Christmas time, another
similar round-trip ticket may be
purchased for the next three-month
period.
Tickets thus sold will be good for
passage in coaches, parlor and sleep
ing cars, applying on first-class con
veniences subject to the payment of
u*ual sleeping car charges for berths.
Details of these arrangements
may be had at any railroad office.
Arrangements have not as yet
been completed for students who
live in Arizona, California, Ne
vada, and Southern Oregon.
Round trip tickets will be sold on
the following dates at home stations:
August 25-October 5: December 25-
JanUary 10: March 15-April 17. The
return portion of the ticket may be
used during December 10-25; March
9-April 15; May 15-June 30.
