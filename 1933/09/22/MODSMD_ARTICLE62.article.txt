riod. ending with pledging before
the lawyer, will extend from Mem

In the hope that past confusion
and illegal rushing will be avoided

to the regular pledging day must
keep out of fraternity houses ex
cept on regularly permitted rushing

Such normal contact is defined as

or the limitation of the numbers of
men allowed to be pledged, or both.
"Penalties will be just as severe
as the case warrants," declared
Tatum. "The freshmen will have
to bear their share of the punish
ment where the fault is partly
theirs."
