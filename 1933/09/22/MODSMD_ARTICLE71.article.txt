# Traffic Improvements Made At Farm Entrance
## 
### 
Summer improvements in the vi
cinity of the Farm include straight
ening out of the curves at the in
tersection of the highway and Palm
Drive, widening of the roadway on
the Palo Alto side of the highway,
and installation of a traffic island
in the middle similar to the one on
the Stanford side.
The change has been made to
move traffic more efficiently into
Palo Alto and more rapidly, al
though the "Traffic Laws Enforced"
sign is still in plain sight. In addi
tion, the entrance to the campus is
made more scenic by the shrubs
which have been planted on the
traffic islands.
