# Stagestruck? Learn To Act At Stanford
## Drama Courses to Offer Interesting Study 
### 
"If you are interested in the
stage—
"If you would like to develop
poise and self-assurance —
"If you like to act and think you'd
like to learn more about it as an
art—
"If you want to make an inter
esting and entertaining study—" #
The answer is simple, according
to several prominent campus per
sonalities. "Plan now to become
actively interested in Stanford
dramatics," they advise.
Three courses connected with the
Theatre are scheduled for autumn
according to Harold Hel
venston, director of Dramatics. Cov
ering work in three distinct fields,
they each offer practical experience
and information to the student.
Heading the list is a class in the
theory and performance of Acting
for beginners. Including the prin
ciples of dramatic interpretation and
characterization and the problems
of make-up, the course deals with a
study of acting by actual perform
ance of plays in the Little Theatre.
It is strictly limited to 22 students,
and those desiring to enroll must
see Helvenston personally on reg
istration day.
Technical Work
For those who are more inter
ested in the technical side of stage
work, a liberal course in theatrical
production is offered in Public
Speaking 121, Theatrical Workshop.
Helvenston gives special instruction
in the design and construction of
stage scenery with attention to prop
erties, costume, lighting, stage man
agement, and miscellaneous phases
or stage craft. Lectures and labora
tory, including actual work on the
two student productions of the quar
ter are offered.
The third course of this quarter
once a week in Criticism, a one- 1 unit
course that meets once a week in
seminar fashion to discuss current
plays and reviews.
Interviews regarding these courses
may be had in the Green Room, in
the History Building, on October 2
or 3.
