## Mary Yost Cordially Greets Both New and Old 
### 
"Cordial greetings to the rew
men and women of 1933 and a warm
'welcome back' to our old stu
dents! The year 1933-34 promises
to be a genuine adventure for stu
| dents and faculty alike.
"Last spring the "500" limit for the
women was removed, and this fact
not only means more women on the
enmpus this year but a greater op
portunity for the women to share
and share alike in the interests and
! responsibilities of the whole stu
i dent body. Many traditional ways
of thinking and feeling, many tra
ditional methods of doing things
l j will be challenged, but the two fun
damental traditions of Stanford j
should be strengthened.
"One is the spirit of real friend
liness existing on the campus be
i tween student and student and stu
dent and faculty; the other, the
j pride in and the respect for the
good name of the University and
for the code of honorable dealing
between all of its members. May
the year bring to all of us a clear
defining of worth-while goals, a
keener realization of individual and
group responsibility, and a quicken
ing' of intellectual curiosity and in
tellectual power. And along the
load may there be gay laughter
and fine comradeship."
