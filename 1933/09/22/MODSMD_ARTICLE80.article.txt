"I am sure, Johnny, that you
will find Stanford today every bit
as friendly and fascinating as I re
call it hack in the nineties when I
was a ncwcomer here myself.''
Thomas A. Storey, '96, medi'.-al ad
viser of men on the Farm and gen
eral director of the School of Hy
giene and Physical Education, smiled
half-wistfully at the recollection
which caused his whole countenance
to light up from the playful spark
ling of his cheerful brown eyes.
"In fact," he went on, warming
up to his subject, "it probably is ten
times as interesting and stimulating
today—if that is possible. Golly, but
it has grown. And the nice part
about it is that it is still Stanford;
the Stanford that we had thirty
years ago, in spirit, thought, and
ambition."
I was really beginning to feel
glad that I had come "back to the
Farm" (although I had never been
here before, the expression conies
as if from old times) so early. As
with the rest of the new students
this year, I had received l)r. Sto
rey's invitation to arrive a week
or so ahead of time and drop in
for a personal chat. And, believe
me, it was an interesting, friendly
one.
"Johnny," Dr. Storey broke in on
my reverie, "I'd like you to meet
Charles Shepard, director of our
men's health service. Dr. Shepard,
this is Johnny Drofnats, one of the
men of '37."
After introductions were acknowl
edged, we started talking about the
nice weather here at Staniord and
all about how Tiny Thornhill's 1933
Big Red Machine is going to roll all
over everything from Northwestern
in Chicago to Washington at Seattle
and, most especially, el Trojan from
the Southland.
Come to think of it, we sort of
skipped over the Big Game as sort
of a casual matter-of-fact aifair.
Tiny tells me, though, that it's going
to be a lot tougher than just that.
"Charlie," said Dr. Storey, "why
don't you tell Johnny a thing or two
about the health service? He's new
on the campus, and wants to know
all he can." I was all ears. I got
that way from high school football.
So this tali, lanky, smiling "I)oc"
Shepard—you ought to meet him
sometime—got himself all wound
up and going strong and in a few
seconds I was hearing all about
how many sick fellows arc cared
for at the health service, how ath
letes are given regular examina
tions to insure good physical
shape, how injuries arc cared lor
by experts, and how students
come to the office here for advice
on all kinds of problems—they
even ask how to pass courses!
"We'd really luce to meet every
Stanford man just as informally as
this today," he continued. "The first
chance we usually have, though, is
at the regular health conference
which we mi'ke with the new stu
dent before his admittance to the
University is certified."
"Guess ihcy keep you pretty
busy," I offered. "Do you have many
cases of fellows becoming finicky
about their health and coming down
for examinations when there is
nothing wrong with 'em?"
"Mo, Johnny," replied Dr. Storey.
"We have very few instances where
that is the case. In fact, whenever
a fellow thinks he has the slightest
symptom of any illness we want him
to come right in to Dr. Shepard's
office for a thorough examination. ,
We'd much rather have 100 exami
nations and 99 perfect, but still cure
•the 100 th case than to have 99 cases
end miss the possible serious one.
"However, we naturally don't
expect the fellows to start imag
ining their ailments. But we do
expect them to notify us the min- j
lite anything seems wrong with
their normal condition. If they
don't they aren't playing fair with
ns or themselves either."
I remarked that it must be a
rather extensive service, and was
surprised to learn that 11 physicians ,
are associated with the Student
Health Service, exclusive of the pro
fessors in the Division of Informa-
