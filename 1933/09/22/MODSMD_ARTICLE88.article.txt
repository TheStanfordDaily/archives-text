# It's Bears vs. Broncs In Tough Grid Opener
## 
### 
"Navy Bill" Ingram leads his
powerful Golden Bears out of the
practice field for the first time to
morrow against Clipper Smith's
formidable Bronco squad from Santa
Clara with a mixture of hope and
confidence as he looks forward to
the 1933 season.
This is the third meeting of the
two schools on the gridiron, and
each has come off victorious once.
Both aim to make this their second
win. Stanford plays Santa Clara
with its "free wheeling" backfield
on October 7 in the stadium here.
