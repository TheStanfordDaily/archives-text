# George Culver Sees Hope of Fine College Year
## Sixteen Sponsors Named To Live in Dormitories 
### 
"No matter how fine our vaca
tions, when we return to the cam
pus there is always the old thrilll of
the opening of fall quarter.
"The campus looks more beauti
ful than ever just now. It is wait
ing for you and for the new men
and women who will find it, as you
have, a place that will become a
living force throughout their lives.
"The anxiety and apprehension
fell during the last year concerning
the possible registration for the
coming quarter have largely dis
appeared. There is every reason to
look forward to a wonderfully fine
year.
"Each individual student can help
to make it one of the best years
we have known. Old students are
entering and new ones are entering
because the public has confidence
in the soundness of Stanford's edu
cational life and policies.
"The Dean of Men is here to help
you with any problems that, may
arise in connection with your edu
cational or social life at Stanford.
He can best learn these problems
if you bring them to him."'
â€”George B. Culver
