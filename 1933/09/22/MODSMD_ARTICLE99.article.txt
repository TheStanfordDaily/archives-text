## 
### 
"This is no easy assignment," said
Pop Warner when he was ask>3d to
pick an all-star Stanford team from
men who played here during his
years on the Farm. Pop was sure
of all positions except tackle and
left half. At tackle he had to choose
Harry Shipkey, Leo Harris, Tiny
Sellman, Chuck Johnston, and Chris
Freeman, who is attending school
this quarter.
For left halfback Warner's deci
sion lay between Lud Frentrup, Phil
MofTatt, Frankie Wilton, Dick Hy
land, and Bill Sim, the boy who
really "went to town" for Stanford
last season.
Ted Shipkey and Ed Walker were
picked as ends, Harry Shipkey and
Leo Harris at tackles, "Dynamite"
Post and Don Robesky at guards,
and Walt Ileinecke at center. In the
brickfield Chuck Smalling was placed
at quarterback, Bob Sims and Bill
Sim at halfbacks, and Ernie Nevers
at fullback.
It is always interesting to note
v. hat becomes of grid stars after
their graduation. Harry and Ted
Shipkey, Wilton, Robesky, Heinecke,
Nevers, Smalling, Walker, and Har
hir, will coach this fall. Bob Sims
is working in San Francisco, "Dyna
mite" Post in Los Angeles, and Bill
Sim, who has fene more year of com
petition left, is registered this au
tumn and expects to become a coach
upon graduation.
