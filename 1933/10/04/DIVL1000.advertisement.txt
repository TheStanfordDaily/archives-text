The man who took "Pop" Warner's job — the man who has built
the Stanford team this season — writes ONLY in the SAN
FRANCISCO EXAMINER. His writings help take the mystery
out of the game. Straight from the shoulder, — that is the way
Thornhill teaches football, —and that is the way he writes in
the San Francisco Examiner.

"TINY" has some of the most talked of young backs in the
West at Stanford. With these he expects to win all of Stanford's
ten games. The formula is simple,— shoulder socking, back
blocking with speed, "Tiny" says, wins football games. Follow
his intensely interesting articles of the games, —the plays, the
players, and the strategy — which appear ONLY in The Exam
iner's big sport pages.

In addition to "Tiny," The Examiner staff of football writers
consists of Curley Grieve, generalissimo of The Examiner sports
department,—Bill Leiser, the Coast's most outstanding football
expert, — Bill Ingram, U. C. Coach, — Mark Kelly, — Warren
Brown, — Royal Brougham and others.
