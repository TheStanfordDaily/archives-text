Assert your Masculinity — wear CAMPUS CORDS
Tricky corduroys may go great guns with the
dance-hall boys —but not with university men!
The favorite on practically every major campus
is the distinctive, conservative trouser called
Campus Cords. Its snug hip fit and straight hang
"click" with even the most critical university men.
This good looking corduroy trouser "takes it and
likes it," month after month—and thrives on clean
ings and tubbings.
The man who features Campus Cords usually
has a keen sense of true university style. See him
today for Campus Cords* and other correct apparel.
+Also look at CAMPUS FLANNELS, CAMPUS TWEEDS,
CAMPUS BUCKS and CAMPUS DUCKS—trousers that
get their style ideas from Campus Cords.
