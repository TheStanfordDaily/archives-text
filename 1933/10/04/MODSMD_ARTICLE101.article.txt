# PLAGE-KICK WINS U.C.L.A. GAME AS POWER DRIVES FAIL
## Smart Strategy Calls For Kick At Critical Spot 
### 
One place kick field goal from the
educated toe of Bill Corbus, Stan
ford's ail-American guard—took on
great importance at last Saturday's
game with U.C.L.A. In a great con
test which everyone thought would
see much more scoring, six distinct
Cardinal drives were repulsed by
the Bruins from the southland.
Early season rustiness in many of
Stanford's best plays and a stubborn
goal-line defense by the Blue and
Gold visitors kept the Big Red ?.la
chine knocking at the door, but not
gaining entrance. Midway in the
first period came the break that led
up to the first of a half-dozen
threats. This was a self-made break
with no luck mixed with it. Bill
Sim sent a beautiful long punt
bouncing along the sidelines to the
Uclan four-yard mark. Fast down
the field and even quicker in div
ing on the pigskin, Monk Moscrip,
stellar soph end, pinned the Bruins'
backs against the wall by downing
the ball at that point. Foi'ced to
kick out, Ucla was again backed
up to the danger zone, this time
with Stanford in possession. A pass,
Maentz to Sim, a penalty on the
visitors, and several short gains on
spinners and reverses brought Ihe
Indians to the eight-yard stripe.
Stalled there on running plays as
well as passes, the best strategy for
the Cards was a place-kick by Cor
bus. Sailing straight between the
uprights, the ball carried Stanford's
triumph with it.
Tiny Thornhill's Warriors had a
fine chance to score in the second
quarter Bill Bates intercepted
one of Frankovich's passes and
scampered clear to the Uclan 29-
yard line—a return of 51 yards.
•Reisner, Grayson, and Afflerbaugh
cracked the Bruin line and swept
the ends to within nine yards of the
payoff soil, but Reisner's fumble
stopped this threat, the visitors re
covering and kicking out of danger.
Stanford came back when Kenny
Afflerbaugh broke loose on a re
verse at right tackle. Dashing 37
yards through a broken field, the
fleef Card back nearly got away to
the races, being nailed only by Che
shire, the safety man. Stanford
came the closest to a touchdown
this time of their six drives, but
the old lack of a goal-line punch
cropped out again and combined
with the stubborn Uclan's defense
to hold the Indians back. Alustiza
hit the right side of the Bruin line
twice and Reisner once, with a net
gain of just five yards. On the
last down, six feet from the goal
line, Afflerbaugh was stopped in his
tracks, just as the third quarter
ended.
The Cards came right back as the
final session began but not quite far
enough. A short U.C.L.A. punt was
nearly offset by a dash around end
by Reisner and several shorter
gains. Stopped cold, however, the
Indians were forced to yield the ball
on downs when Alustiza's pass went
incomplete.
This latest threat was checked
when the ever-active Moscrip re
covered Olmsted's fumble to give
the Cardinals one more chance. A
little safer advantage was barely
missed when Corbus' second kick
hit upright. Sim's fumble ended
Stanford's last knock at the goal
line door just later.
