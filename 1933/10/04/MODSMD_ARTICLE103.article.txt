# SENATORS BOW TO GIANTS IN WORLD SERIES OPENER
## 
### 
POLO GROUNDS, New York,
Oct. 3 (SP)). —Unshaken either by
the faltering defense of his team
nu'tes or the enemy's closing threats,
1 the great Carl Owen Hubbell
throttled the big guns of the Wash
ington Senators today and pitched
the New York Giants to victory,
4 to 2, in the fh'st game of the world
j sei'ies.
Just as National leaguers had
hoped and their rivals had feared,
the lean, lash-like left arm of the
Oklahoma southpaw subdued the
champions of the American League
with an exhibition that was mas
terful, despite the background of a
shaky defense at critical moments.
Hubbell held the hard swinging
Senators to five hits, struck out ten
of them, including the first three
batsmen to face him, and gave a
superb exhibition of steadiness un
der pressure in the last two dra
matic innings.
The Giants, with a lusty early
onslaught led by "Little Mel"
Ott. who collected four hits in as
many times at bat, including a
first inning home run, routed
j Wally (Lefty) Stewart, the Tcn-
I Jiessee veteran, in the third in
ning.
They rushed the Senators off their
feet with a surge that belied their
i label of "hitless wonders," but their
infield defense was erratic, and they
forced Hubbell to bear down with
everything at his command at the
finish, where Washington was
stopped with the tying run on sec
| one! base.
But for two errors behind him
that paved the way for the Sena- i
tors to score in the fourth and ninth j
innings, Hubbell might, have cele

j hrated his world series debut with
I a shutout.
Iluhheil Comes Through
The near capacity crowd of 4tJ,6lg
saw the great southpaw pitch him
selft out of difficulties in the eighth
j and ninth innings. Up to that stage
: of the game, working smoothly and
! effectively behind a 4 to 1 lead,
Hubbell had the Senator clouters
handcuffed. In six of the first sev
|en innings only three Senators
I batted against the lanky left hander.
Suddenly, after fanning Bluegc
at the start of the eighth, Hub-
I hell momentarily lost control, but
the Senators failed to score.
I Under the circumstances, it was
a close call for the Giants after
they had outplayed and outhit the
; Senators most of the way. Not only
s wa<- the Giant infield shaky, on both
j sides, but the Senators' usually re
| liable second sacker, Myer, had the
! dubious distinction of tying a world
! scries record by making no less than
i three misplays.
! It will be a right banders' duel
tomorrow, with young Hal Schu
j macher of the Giants opposing
I "General" A1 Crowder of the Sena
' tors in the second game, after which
i the combatants depart for Wash
ington and the third game of the
series in the capital Thursday.

POLO GROUNDS, New York,
Oct. 3 (SP)). —Unshaken either by
the faltering defense of his team
nu'tes or the enemy's closing threats,
1 the great Carl Owen Hubbell
throttled the big guns of the Wash
ington Senators today and pitched
the New York Giants to victory,
4 to 2, in the fh'st game of the world
j sei'ies.
Just as National leaguers had
hoped and their rivals had feared,
the lean, lash-like left arm of the
Oklahoma southpaw subdued the
champions of the American League
with an exhibition that was mas
terful, despite the background of a
shaky defense at critical moments.
Hubbell held the hard swinging
Senators to five hits, struck out ten
of them, including the first three
batsmen to face him, and gave a
superb exhibition of steadiness un
der pressure in the last two dra
matic innings.
The Giants, with a lusty early
onslaught led by "Little Mel"
Ott. who collected four hits in as
many times at bat, including a
first inning home run, routed
j Wally (Lefty) Stewart, the Tcn-
I Jiessee veteran, in the third in
ning.
