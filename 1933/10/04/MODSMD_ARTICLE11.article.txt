# Shaw Satire Tryouts Set For Tonight
## 'Arms And The Man' Will Open Theatre Year 
### James Sandoe 
"Arms and the Man," first of the
plays by George Bernard Shaw to
be produced in this country, has
been selected by Director of Dra
matics Harold Helvenston as the ini
tial production of the Fall Quarter
at Stanford.
The play, happily free from the
undramatic debates which have
characterized so much of Shaw's
more recent work, is a satire on
war. The setting is the eternally un
settled Balkan district during the
particular Bulgo-Servian fray of
1885.
Ask for Students
Tryouts for the play, which arc
open to all students other than
freshman women, are to be held
this evening at 7:30 o'clock in the
Little Theatre.
There are eight roles in the play,
three for women, five for men. As
usual, Shfiw may be expected to
perform the unexpected. In this
play the servants have the unusual
distinction of being important char
acters rather than woodwork adorn
ments.
The leading characters are Raina,
daughter of the gruff Bulgarian Ma
jor PctkofT, and the Swiss captain
of Serbian troops, Bluntschli, who is,
it transpires, her "chocolate-cream
soldier."
Minor Characters
Other characters are the militant
Major Sergius Saranoff, finance of
Raina, Catherine, her imperious
mother, Louka, a proud servant in
their home, Nicola, a solemn man
servant, and a Russian officer.
Director Helvenston desired it to
.be noted particularly that he is
planning to take notes at tryouts
for future plays as well as for the
j mere immediate production.
Board payers in Encina last quar
ter may collect their refunds at the
Encina office. The maximum from
1 last quarter is twelve dollars.
