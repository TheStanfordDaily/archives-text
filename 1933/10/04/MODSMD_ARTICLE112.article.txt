# Varsity Aided By '36 Stars
## 
### 
Experience may count, but if it |
does Stanford's football team this i
year may not live up to optimistic j
campus expectations. For, with
three sophomore regulars and one
co-regular, the Class of '36 is shov- ,
ing seniors and juniors onto the |
bench.
Monk Moscrip, already heralded â– 
as a combination of Benny Ooster- j
b;.an and Brick Muller, is the lead
ing candidate among the younger j
candidates for regular posts on Tiny ;
Thornhill's 1933 Big Red Machine. |
Moscrip, aggressive and smart and !
above all speedy, has starred in
both of the Stanford games to date.
Bones Hamilton, injured in the
U.C.L.A. game and a star at Kiski
Military Institute, is the first-string j
light half when in healthy condi
tion. Hamilton has been keeping
Kenny Afflerbaugh playing second j
tiddle, and Afflerbaugh is an ace in j
his own right.
The third of the little big shots is j
Claude Callaway, giant sophomore |
tackle. Callaway was but one of the ,
three star freshman tackles last
year, and Carlson and Reynolds, the
other two, are varsity squad mem
bers at present.
Bobby Grayson, the pride of ;
Portland, is sharing the fullback
duties with Jack Hillman and Frank
Alustiza. Alustiza, also a second- j
year man, is a punter of the Ander- ,
son type, while Grayson is the fast- i
est big man on the squad and may
be Stanford's next Ernie Nevers. j
In addition, there are speedy
Johnny Reisner from San Fran
cisco, who is giving Bob Maentz a
tough fight for the all-important left
halfback position and whose run
back of that punt in the U.C.L.A.
game was one of its features; Rou
ble and Adams, the redoubtable line
' stars of last year's f'rosh squad;
Alex Trompas, injured end; Alf
Brandin, aggressive center; and Earl
Hoos, the present understudy of Bill
1 Sim at quarterback.
