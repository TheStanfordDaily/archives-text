# '34 CINDER PROSPECTS IMPRESSIVE IN SPITE OF LOSS OF VETERANS
## 
### 
Although Dink Templeton suffers <
lh< loss of twelve lettermen from !
last season's squad the foundation,
of a powerful team is in the offing.
The loss of Hables in the sprints !
.nut Eastman in the middle distances
will be hardest felt. Rice and Wil
' on appear to be the Indians' only ;
hopes of breaking ten flat. In the
440 Al Blaekman should be the class j
ol the coast runners. If Chuck Nimo
runs the 880 as well besides the
mile al! worries should be dismissed.
Nimo, with 4:32.(1,10 his credit in
the mile, should move in with the
best on the coast. Amdahl and Ave
vtdo will return to take care of
ihe two-mile.
In the hurdles it looks lika a clean
sweep in most of the duel meets for
the Indians. Captain C.us Meier,

â–  easily the outstanding collegiate !
I hurdler of the 1934 season, should '
find good competition from his j
1 teammates Kingsbury and Klop- I
stock coming up from the freshman !
: team.
The loss of Laborde and Crey in
the weights will not be badly missed j
; with Dunn arid Lyman in there. 1
With Bud Deacon in the pole vault, I
Johnny Mottram in the javlin, J
Zaches, Williams, and Lewis in the
broad jump, Schween, Albertson,
and Howie Arthur a new man capa
ble of 6 feet 6 inches in the high j
jump the field events balance up
i well.
The relay seems to be the weak
est event. Rice, Arthur, Del linger, !
Davis, and Blackmail will do their
best to carry on the tradition of j
, winning relay teams at Stanford.
