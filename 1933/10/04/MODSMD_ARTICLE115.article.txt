# TROJANS, SAINTS RATED OUTSTANDIG AS COAST FOOTBALL SEASON OPENS
## 
### Frank Tremaine 
With two of the outstanding con
tenders for national championship
honors battling on the Pacific Coast,
Western football should see one of
its most successful seasons. In ad
dition to St. Mary's and U.S.C., who
should be in the thick of the battle
for the national title, at least four
other teams can be rated in the up
per stratum of the country's grid
machines.
Barring injuries, the Trojans
should win the Pacific Coast confer
ence title while the Gael-S.C. battle
in Los Angeles may settle the ques
tion of the national championship.
Both U.S.C. and St. Mary's have
line:- averaging around 205 pounds
with backfields coming close to 190.
"Slip" Madigan can put an all-vet
eran team on the field at Moraga,
but a crew of brilliant sophomores
are putting the veterans' jobs in
jeopardy.
Stanford, California, Washington
State, and Santa Clara complete the
coast roster. The Indians, with a
new coach and a host of untried
sophomores, are rated as an un-

1 known quantity, yet are potentially
a great team and with Tiny
Thornhill at'the helm for the first
i time, may provide the season's big
gest upsets.
Bill Ingram at California confi
dently expects a big year despite the
early season upset by Santa Clara
fcr the second time in a row.
Blessed with the best material on
the Coast with the exception of
U.S.C., the Bears should have one
of their best seasons in some time.
It is this team that Howard Jones
of U.S.C. says he fears more than
1 either St. Mary's or .Washington
State.
Furnishing the usual early season
upset, Clipper Smith's Broncos from
Santa Clara must be counted well
up due to their victory over Cali
fornia. Man power is plentiful at
Santa Clara with three capable men
for every line position and four for
each of the backfield berths. Out
standing on the team, of course, is
"Diamond Joe" Paglia, one of the
greatest kickers ever developed on
j the Coast.

It is this team that Howard Jones
of U.S.C. says he fears more than
1 either St. Mary's or .Washington
State.
Furnishing the usual early season
upset, Clipper Smith's Broncos from
Santa Clara must be counted well
up due to their victory over Cali
fornia. Man power is plentiful at
Santa Clara with three capable men
for every line position and four for
each of the backfield berths. Out
standing on the team, of course, is
"Diamond Joe" Paglia, one of the
greatest kickers ever developed on
j the Coast.
