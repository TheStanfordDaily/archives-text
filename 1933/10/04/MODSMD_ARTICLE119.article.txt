# Rugby, Cross-Country Continued for '33-34
## 
### 
Two sports, new last year, will be
continued in 1933-34, because of the
phenomenal success which they met
with last year.
The rugby team, made up of mem
! bers of the football and soccer
i squads, as well as many who did not
compete in other sports, played a
full schedule of games and drew
I large crowds for most of them. The
president of the rugby club for this
year is "Chuck" White, right half
back on "Tiny" Thornhill's football
varsity, while Bill Sim is one of the
greatest scoring threats.
The rugby team is considering
trips to Canada and Australia this
I year. There is a good chance that
both barnstorming tours will be un
dertaken.
Last year cross-country was held
for the first time, during the win
i ter and spring quarters. A match
' was arranged with California, and
many prominent trackmen com
| peted. This sport likewise will be
continued this year.
Pop Warner's Temple gridders
i won their season opener last Friday.
