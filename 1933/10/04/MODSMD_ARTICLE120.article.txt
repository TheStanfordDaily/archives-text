# FRESHMAN TEAM GOOD ON DEFENSE, WEAK OFFENSIVELY
## 
### 
Faced by inevitable comparison
with last year's freshman wonder
team and handicapped by a lack of
similar bountiful material, Coach
Jimmie Bradshaw's 1933 edition of
the Little Red Machine has over
come these initial difficulties to the
extent of turning in two one-point
victories for a hundred per cent
early season record.
A powerful San Mateo Junior
College team, heavy and fresh from
a 19 to 0 defeat of the San Francisco
Teachers College, was upset 7 to 6
by the yearlings, who repeated the
score last Saturday against Modesto
Junior College. An intercepted pass
in the first game and a recovered
fumble in the second resulted in the
two Stanford scores.
Strong defensively and weak of
fensively, as the foregoing touch
down record indicates, the freshmen
will concentrate this week on pol
ishmg up their scoring attack which
i.s expected to improve as the ex
high stars get more used to playing
together.
Also responsible for the disparity
in offensive and defensive strength
is the fact that Bradshaw is pretty
well supplied with big, husky line
men while good backs are scarce
and comparatively light. A weak
ness at the guard posts was pretty
nearly eliminated Monday by the
arrival of Jack Walton, a 200-
pounder from San Francisco. Team
ing with Melvin Hurley, another
200-pound giant from Paso Robles,
Walton adds plenty of weight to this
part of the line. Reserve guards
will be pretty light, with Cottrell,
Senders, and Taylor stacking up as
Ihe best of the group.
George Bergman of Inglewood has
been holding down the first-string
center job with Ralph Quails, from
Bakersfield, ready to step into the
position whenever needed. Louis
Tsoutsouvas of Santa Barbara who,
according to the expert authority of
Don Liebendorfer, pronounces his
name Choochoovas, looms as about
the best of the tackles. He is an
other of Bradshaw's 200-pounders,
Playing at the other tackle will
probably be Dale Beedle from Mi
ami, Arizona, who also approaches
the 200-pound mark. Ray William
son, 190, is another outstanding
tackle.
Ends, when on deck and fully re
covered, will probably be Carl
Schott, from Galileo in San Fran
cisco, and Walter Schouteau of
Si nta Monica who also hovers |
around the popular 200-pound mark.
Schott, however, is out with a
broken toe and will probably not
see action until the S.C. game. Har
old Elder, from Mission High in San
Francisco, and Bob Jenkins, ot
Honolulu, form another good pair of
ends. Jim Reynolds, a promising
end candidate who received his prep
training at Kiski in Pennsylvania,
is out for the season with a bad ieg.
Rusty Ledbetter, a hard-driving
fullback but somewhat weak on the
finer points of his position, adds
weight and punch to the backfield
with his 190 pounds. Joe Vigna, a
light but speedy back from Stock
ton, has been running the team at
quarter. Teaming at the halves are
Fred Williams and Grigo Turretto.
The former hails from Olathe, Colo
rado, and the latter from the much
closer hamlet of San Jose. A1 Brent,
of San Diego, i.s another of the bet
ter backs.
Turretto is distinguished for his
kicking ability while Vigna and Wil
liams are said to be dangerous in
the open field. An opening turnout
of 75 men has been pared down to
50 by Bradshaw and will probably
be kept at this number for the bal
ance of the season.
