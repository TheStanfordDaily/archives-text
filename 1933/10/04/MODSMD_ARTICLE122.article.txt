# J. C. HOOPSTER TRANSFERS WILL BOLSTER TEAM
## 
### 
With only two lettermen return
ing, basketball Coach John Bunn
has started to rebuild the Indian
| team with the hopes of bringing a
' conference championship "back to
the farm." Coach Bunn believes
! that junior college transfers and a
! number of players from the fresh-
I men team of last year will give the
j 1933-34 team more scoring power.
Captain Hal Edelen and Keith
; Topping are the returning letter
men who are expected to be the
nucleus of the team, while A1 Page
and Charles Rogers from last year's
! squad are expected to be varsity
; material this season. Two players,
Bud Shreve and Hal Jenkins, al
though they did not compete last
j year, are expected to be out for
: practice shortly.
Coming up from Coach Jimmy
i Bradshaw's Papoose team of last
| season which defeated the Cal babes
, three straight, will be George Vi
[ guie and Dava Farber. Much i c ex
pected from the first-named player,
[ for at the close of last year he
[ looked like a promising varsity
I player.
Heading the transfers from junior
| colleges will be Arne Anderson and
j Robbin Lindsey, teammates at
i Menlo. A former Palo Alto high
| star, Anderson was one of the out
standing forwards in the conference
| two years ago, but was handicapped
by a broken wrist last year. Lindsey
led the scorers at Menlo and was
i outstanding in defensive work at
1 guard. From Salinas comes Sam
i Griswold, scoring threat for the val
! ley team. Another outstanding
i transfer is Bill Cowing from Moran,
Allen Sadler edits the Quad copy
| this year.
