# Want To Root, Rooters? Then Buy Caps Now!
## 
### 
Students who intend to go to the
Santa Clara game Saturday must
wear official rooters' caps. These
are red on one side, white on the
other. According to the Rally Com
mittee, no students will be admitted
to the rooting section who are not
wearing them.
The official caps may be procured
at Wideman and Son, Palo Alto, for
65 cents. This is 35 cents less than
in past years.
