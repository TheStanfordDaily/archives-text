# KAHN ASKS LIVING GROUPS TO NAME SPORTS MANAGERS
## 
### 
Student Director of Intramural j
Athletics Marvie Kahn last night I
announced that he would request all j
living group presidents to proceed j
immediately with the selection of
their intramural sports managers.
These managers will serve their
individual organizations as members
of an intramural council for the |
whole school year, and Kahn has J
called the first meeting of the coun- J
cil for Wednesday, October 10, at 8 !
o'clock in the B.A.C. building. At
that time three members of the In- :
tramural Staff will be elected and
various problems decided.
Match golf play starts October 18
and touch football in about three
weeks. Group managers must sign j
up for these sports in advance of the j
opening dates or the organization !
will be unable to compete. Other |
fall sports include handball and :
track.
In signing up for a sport, mana- i
gers will not only be required to |
give the name of their group, but j
they must also leave a roster of all i
men who may participate in the (
sport.
