# Campus Likes New Deal In New Women
##

"I transferred from Cal."
"I entered Stanford instead of
coming out this year."
"I was admitted to Wellesley but
decided to come to Stanford."
They came! From Tokyo and Ar
kansas, from Calexico and Alaska,
an avalanche of new women de
scended upon Stanford on Monday
I and treated roughs to the sight of
' more women, en masse than ..ny
j Stanford man has seen since the be-
J ginning of time.
I The new deal in women was un
! animously declared a success on the
campus yesterday. To put it mildly,
A.S.S.U. President Jerry Trautman
declared he was "favorably im
pressed." He added, "They look
| pretty good to me."
j Johnny Lyman, Card track star,
! from his advantageous position in
i the Administration building as ad
viser to entering men reported, "The
! new women are pretty scrumptious,
j Stanford could never have too many
j of them."
Members of the former "500" were
!no less enthusiastic in their wel
come to the new women. "I hope
as many more will enter winter
I quarter," said Jeanne Millard,
A.W.S. president.
Some of the new women brought
their mothers to registration, some
brought shining new cars, some even
drove up to sorority houses, expect
ing to be admitted, but they came,
they registered, they conquered!
