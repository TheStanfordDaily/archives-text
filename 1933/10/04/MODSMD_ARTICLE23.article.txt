# Union Dining Plans Given
## 
### 
Traditional privileges of men who
like to dine and lounge in the Union
will not be abrogated this year be
eause of the influx of women to the
erstwhile men's hall.
The spacious Union lobby will
still be open for those who would
like to smoke and read there. The
dining room, likewise, will be open
to Stanford men and women, and to
the general public, as in the past.
Miss Christine Ricker, Director of
the Union, points out that clubs and
other groups will be welcome to
convene in the private rooms of the
dining unit.
Women from Elm Cottage, Madro
no and Mariposa Halls, and the New
Union will have their meals at the
Union cafeteria, which will no long
er be open to the public. Women
from these four groups, forming the
"Union unit," will have breakfast
and lunch "cafeteria style"; dinner,
however, will be served.
Stanford Concert Series will pre
sent one extra program this year.
