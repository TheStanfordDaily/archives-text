### Dick Van Wagenen 
As the telegram adjoining ex
claims, (he "Daily," at its first op
portunity, has jumped in under the
spreading wing of the NRA eagle.
On the wall of the editor's sanc
tum hang two objects: a photograph
of President Ray Lyman Wilbur,
and, with its head turned toward
the; picture, a large Blue Eagle pos
ter.
The NRA does not apply to edu
cational institutions. Hence all the
above is a gesture, as far as the
Daily is concerned —a sincere one.
The blanket agreement, as applying
to college publications, was signed.
The University administration and
academic offices have operated prac
tically on the terms of Ihe code as
a regular thing, and professional
people as a whole are exempt;
therefore, small change in that de
partment.
But the Daily is not the first cam
pus organization to sign the code.
Tackcd on the postoffice bulletin
board is a list of campus joiners.
In early August the Union Barber
Shop and Nathan Van Patten, Di
rector of University Libraries,
signed; shortly following them came
the Bookstore, with its fifteen em
ployees; by the middle of the month
the Campus Shoe Shop was a mem
ber, and the latest bulletin, of Sep
tember 29, includes the Encina Bar
ber Shop, the Stanford Wholesale
Commissary, and the Stanford Daily.
Since then, however, according to
Assistant Comptroller E. S. Erwin,
the entire University dining system
har signed—the Union, Encina Com
mons, and Roble. Under the cafe
code, these have shortened hours
and thereby increased professional
jobs, student help remaining about
the same.
The Corporation Yard, while not
actually working as a signed code
member, has operated on the forty
hour week for over a year, and the
University Press, maintaining the
standard if other college printing
plants, finds a 36 to 40-hour week
the rule.
