'I lie person w ho advised against whistling for forgot ten
dogs forgot Hint it is highly desirable to clean up the dirt
they leave behind tlieni. And that barking journalistic
monstrosity the last Dailt/ of last Spring Quarter at
tempted at least to leave dirt on many a campus door-step.
'i lint paper dealt in unprecedented lengths with a hor
rible person named Abe Mellinkofl'. The principal horror
lay, as one would readily guess, in the defeat of that jollv
< iiquc known as the "Poker Trust" a ruthless group that
had run the Dailt/ for some years. Their political machina
tions, long a fetid marvel, hist election reached an all-time
high of olfactory annoyance (big slink).
And a courageous Executive Committee headed by
President I>i 11 Corbus refused to let bad enough alone.
That was the second horror. The Kx Committee investi
gated the Poker Trust. And acted on its findings in a
constilutional manner. The revealed facts demanded a
boot be applied to the Poker Trust. The boot was applied,
the Poker Trust was pained and not a little dazed.
The Poker Trust this group of admitted journalists
was obsessed by the sophomoric idea that supermen (i.e.,
members of the Poker Trust) were not hound bv the rules
of sportsmanship that bound what sophomores know
\ielsehc called the herd (i.e., the rest of us). This obses
sion was carried into Dailt/ elections and the result was
blatant vole corraling. /huh/ positions were sold for edi
torial votes. And the certainty of the sales was assured by
violating the secrecy of the ballot. Voting lists were
padded.
Everything was perfectly fixed. The Poker Trust as
sured all opposition of a stacked deck of marked cards.
I hus they perpetuated themselves in ollice. And all Ibis
without qualms because these jolly fellows, in their sopho
moric delight, fell that only duds played according to the
rules of the game.
'I heir system was so perfect that utter amazement was
their first reaction when the Kx Committee Upset their cart
of rotten apples. 'That amazement lurned'to gall when the
idea finally permeated (hat they were finished.
With but one issue remaining to them, they lathered
themselves for one last furious outburst. They were de
termined lo blacken Hill Corbus and send the Kx Com
mittee out of office with a synthetic cloud hovering over
it. Convinced of the utter froth of their words, no reply
was lo be possible. And even the measly ten inches of Hull
Session space was censored lo prevent an answer.
Like little llearstlings on the loose, the Poker Trust
strutted around the Dailt/ Ollice, on that, their last nighl,
while they 'published their sensational sheet.
II was sad, for they were dazed that the Ex Committee
had remained self-possessed and unchanged even when
warned of the impending journalistic avalanche that the
Poker 'Trust was about lo unloosen on them. It was doubly
sad for I hey were seeing the Dailtj pass lo an editor who
publicly preferred bridge to poker, who could not "roll his
own," who laughed at "Front Page" movie tinsel that gave
the Poker "Trust boys such keen inner joy, and who was
openly idealistic enough to feel that the Dailt/ editorship
was a student body trust.
