II is not at ;ill disrespectful to speak of Professor Ever
ett Wallace Smith as Prof Smith, hi life, he considered
that appropriate enough. And he would not he one to
re(|uire additional formality because on Septeniher 21lh
he resigned his place in this world and passed over the
narrow chasm that separates us, the living, from him, the
dead.
lie held a unique position in student life. He was not
faculty adviser to the Daily though his faculty colleagues
condemned him personally for every misplaced comma.
The Daily has no faculty control a-policy that he favored
since his own days as Daily editor.
He was friend to a long succession of Daily editors. As
friend and equal he advised them. He believed that youth
should he given advice but never should it he cudgeled into
submission. Ile never did.
At best, a professor seeks to understand students by
remembering his own youth and judging from that prem
ise. Mill Prof Smith went infinitely further. He readjusted
his own viewpoint with each succeeding college generation.
Prof Smith was 100 young to die. He derived too much
pleasure walking across the Inner Quad on a cool October
afternoon. He gave students too much when thev drifted
into his ollice or when he, as informally, dropped down to
the I)AILY ollice.
As I read over the friendly and charmingly frank letters
l:e wrote me litis summer, it does not seem that he has gone.
It seems that I could walk into his corner ollice in Ihe Press
I'.uilding; plant myself on his radiator; put my feet on a
chair; bum a cigarette and talk with him of the Daily.
Stanford, or anything that two college men might find
interesting.
