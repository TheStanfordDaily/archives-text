Surviving another attempt on his
life, this time in the form of a 30-
shot fusillade aimed at his armored
car, President Grau San Martin
continues to lead an unhappy ex
istence. Grave-diggers began bury
ing the 53 dead following yester
day's .pitched battle in and around
Havana's famed National Hotel.
Five hundred officers, with but a
few rifles and a single daily meal
between them, had for some time
withstood a siege by artillery, but
after heavy losses, claim they were
induced to surrender when told the
American marines were about to
land.
With the interior of the island still
seething with unrest, the first
American fatality occurred in a
Havana street fight yesterday. A
thorough investigation of the inci
dent was demanded by Secretary
Hull. In the meantime, marines
were held in readiness to land.
