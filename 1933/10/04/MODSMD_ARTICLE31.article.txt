Another embryonic Sarajevo in
cident probably went by the boaixl
when Rudolf Bertil, who yesterday
blazed away at and slightly wound
ed "Millimetternich" Dollfuss, was
shown not a German, nor a Nazi
sympathizer but a mere crazed-man,
another Zangara.
Had the little Austrian chancellor [
i been killed, or especially had Ihn as- |
| sassin been found a Nazi, war men- ,
ace would have been very real. 1
Contestants are doubtful but surely j
will comprise Austria and France j
vs. Germany, and possibly involve
Italy, Hungary, and any number of
anxious little and big powers who
depend upon or damn strong-armed,
one-man cabinet Dolfuss for pre
serving an independent Austria from
i hungry, like-lingual Germany.
