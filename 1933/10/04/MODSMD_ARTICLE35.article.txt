DOCTOR BULL (Fox) At the Stan
ford Theatre.
The three little pigs and their
playmate, the big bad wolf, monop
olize the Stanford screen this week,
where the Disney cartoon is play
ing a return engagement. Short,
clever, wholly amusing, the current
piece combines the best of Disney
ana, Technicolor, and synchroniza
tion.
j After that atrocity entitled "Pil
i grimage,'' Director John Ford would
need a masterpiece to redeem him
with this department (a fact which
jLiobably concerns him not at all),
but "Doctor Bull" is assuredly not
a masterpiece.
A casual adaptation from Couz-
I zens' "The Last Adam," the film
! seeks to embrace a number of points
oT interest and thus lacks coherence.
It introduced several plots, toys
with them throughout the narra
tive, and then, realizing that it is,
just about closing time, dashes in
posthaste and neatly disposes of
i most of the loose ends.
A Will Rogers picture is a Will
Rogers picture, and as such this
qualifies as entertainment. With
less "homely" philosophy than is
his wont, the comedian turns in just
about the same characterization Ihat
we read on the front page every
day.
The 'film is distingiyshed from
previous Rogers efforts by the pres- ,
ence of a romance, in which the j
i comic is really rather charming and
not nearly so gauche as might be
expected. His partner in this con- i
nection is Vera Allen, who displays |
' much quiet charm and an ability
for characterization.
The other roles in the film are
negligible, with Marian Nixon in a ;
lule which is almost as colorless as
the one she labored under in "Pil
grimage." Louise Dresser is buried >
i under a disagreeable role, and the j
other players run fairly true to the j
small town type.—Chapin.
