### 
Ailing .students are again offered
the facilities oi' the Stanford Rest
Hemes. Mrs. Mary M. Owens, di
rector of the women's home, re
ported four women receiving treat
ment last night, while Mrs. H. C.
Carr, director of the men's home,
had no charges.
Each year the Stanford Mothers'
Club and the University have out
fitted and operated the rest homes
for students who need medical at
tention but are not hospital cases.
The men's rest home is situated at
1117 Hamilton Street and the
women's at 533 Salvatierra. Last
year each of the homes accommo
dated nearly 200 students.
Treatment consists of dieting, fol
lowing doctor's instructions, and ap
plying minor medical aids that do
not require the services of a phy
sician. Trained nurses may be ob
tained if the case requires.
Cost of using the Rest Homes is
three dollars per day. For the first
five days that the student spends in
the home the University pays two
of the three dollars. After the five
day period the students must pay
the entire daily price.
