# Crowd, Moon High Spots Of Registration Dance
## 
### 
Crowds were the chief feature of
this quarter's 'Reg" dance, spon
sored by Sigma Delta Chi and put
over by Jim Algar. impressario of
many successful campus dances.
Craig's Cardinals gave the music
which featured several tango num
bers, somewhat of a novelty at a
campus dance. Decorations were
absent except for the lighting, but
the moon in the patio was enough.
One thing was especially notable
about this Registration dance â€”the
women present. They weren't the
Old Guard of the "500," but a new
group, somehow different but still
Stanford women.
