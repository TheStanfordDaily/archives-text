# STUDENTS BREAK LEGEND TO RAISE GRADE AVERAGES
## 
### 
In opposition to popular legend,
Stanford undergraduate students
improved their grade point stand
ings steadily throughout the 1932-33
school year, according to figures re
leased today by the registrar's of
fice.
Popular legend has long held that
scholastic ratings are highest during
winter quarter, lowest after spring
quarter.
Registrar's office statisticians com
puted the ratio of grade points to
registered units for the various un
dergraduate student groups, then a
plus or minus rating from that fig-

These figures explain in part |
what becomes of potential varsity j,
football players in that* the yearling
squad tied with the varsity baseball
men for the lowest rating among j
athletic teams. Moreover, the frosh j
football men's ratio was 2.17 during
football season, 2.3(5 winter quarter,
and 2.48 in the spring.
Experienced in scholastic ways,
the varsity football team showed no I
such seasonal fluctuation. Its minus j
one average for the year was
equaled by other groups on the |
campus, many of which were not
athletic ones.
Undergraduate women had an av
erage of plus two while the men
came out minus one. Only three
sororities went down to plus one, |
Â«.nly three fraternities came up to |
plus one.
Non - fraternity men rated plus j
zero, while the Row men averaged
minus one.
Branner led all men's halls with I
plus two, which tied the Roble and
all-sorority average, and Phi Beta j
Kappa retained the lead of all ;
groups with plus seven, Phi Lambda |
Upsilon being second with plus six.
