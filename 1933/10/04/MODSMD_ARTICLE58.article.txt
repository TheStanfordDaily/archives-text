# WILLIS DENIES QUAKE PREDICT

Bailey Willis, Stanford's author
ity on earthquakes and much mis
quoted professor, denied yesterday
that he "predicted" - the tremblors
which occurred in the vicinity of
Los Angeles Monday morning. How
ever he did not seem to have been
surprised by the news.
Willis explained that after-shakes
may be expected to follow any im- I
portant movements in the earth. '
Monday's disturbance was only an 1
aftermath of the shock on March 10
and appears to have been centered
on the same fault.
Monday's shock was recorded over
a much larger area than the ones
| preceding it which indicates that the
| recent shakes originated deeper in
: the earth than did those in March.
The focus being deeper, the energy
i spread out further, but was diffused
! throughout a larger mass and had
less intensity on arriving at the sur
| face.
"What we do know is that there
are periods of increasing strain
when earthquakes are slight and
periods of decreasing strain due to
i stronger shocks that use up the en- |
' ergy faster than it accumulates, j
j Hence the truism that the further
Iwe are from the last shock the
' nearer we are to the next one.''
Dr. Willis hopes that the high po
i tential strain which has been build
ing up during the last 27 years in
this vicinity may be relieved grad
j vally by several moderate quakes as
I seems to be the case in the South,
i rather than by a more severe one.
