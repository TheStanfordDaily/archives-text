President Jerry Trautman, the Ex
Committee had a sweet and peaceful
meeting last night.
A mass of business was eased
through the meeting at the joint
suggestion of the president and Stu
dent Manager Les Hables.
Of prime importance was the elec
tion of Stan Beaubaire as Rally
Committee Chairman. A vacancy
was created when Andrews Harris
resigned from the post. Beaubaire
has been acting as temporary chair
man since before the U.C.L.A. game
at the appointment of President
Trautman.
Kirkwood Approves
The constitutionality of the elec
tion by the Ex Committee to fill the
vacancy was approved* by Dean
Kirkwood of the Law School.
A second apopintment went to
Mary Anita Loos as delegate-at
large on the Dramatic Council.
Showing a co-operative spirit with
the President, the Ex Committee
without argument or one dissenting
vote approved Trautman's recom
mendation of Miss Loos for the po
sition.
Wilbur's Restriction
A brief denoument to the tan
gled dramatic situation of last spring
quarter was reached by empowering
the student manager to handle the
problem. This power has two limi
tations. First, the order by Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur that Direc
tor Helvenston will have full choice
of plays during the present academic
year. Second, the Ex Committee has
reserved the power to reverse Man
ager Hables' decisions if they so
desire.
Problem of Dates
The ever-present problem of what
organizations are to get "dates"
came up on two fronts. Alumni
Front: The Stanford Women's Pe
ninsula Club requested Big Game
night for an All-University dance.
They were refused at this time be
cause the Ex Committee is itself
considering sponsoring a dance on
that night. Women's front: The Ro
ble and Union Clubs were granted a
date for an all-Hall-women dance
on October 14.
The Registration Dance made the
move to adjourn a welcome one.
