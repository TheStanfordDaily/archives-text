# Helvenston Curries Farm Drama Fame Below Rio
## 
### 
Down across the border in the '
land of tcmales and chili and dark
skinned senoritas who di'ink a min
imum of eight per cent beer, they
are still talking about Stanford's
master artist and the production he
favored them with this summer.
Harold Heivenston, director of
Stanford dramatics, made the jour
ney in September through the land
o. ; the fearsome Imndito and on into
the ancient metropolis of Mexico j
City, where he staged and designed 1
the scenery for Rachael Crothers' :
popular comedy "Let Us Be Gav." ;
Heivenston was brought to Mex
ico by the Little Theatre group of j
Mexico City, who arranged the pro- 1
duction for English-speaking resi
dents of the region. All actors were ;
adult, experienced, and offered Hel- !
venston's own interpretation of the j
play with the entire action in one
setting.

1 Produced in the government- :
owned Hidalgo Theatre, well over |
100 years old, "Let Us Be Gay" j
brought forth a wealth of favorable |
' comment in the Mexican press. It i
is a quaint playhouse with a slop- I
inp stage floor and four or five tiers j
of boxes arranged in circles around j
(ho auditorium. Helvenston, with j
his meager knowledge of Spanish, !
was able to direct his Mexican as- [
si&tants in constructing the set and !
j to complete his production within |
'l 1/ days from the first rehearsal.
The audience was composed of !
i members of the Anglo-American
colony, with special reserved boxes !
for the United States Embassy and
Consulate, the Chinese Legation,
j find the Mexican theatrical and ed~
; ucation officials. News stories daily j
' crrried much information regarding i
j the director's fame at Stanford as a j
; theatrical artist, and described him |
1 as "a genius akin to a Barrie."
