With three sophomore members of
the Daily's business staff failing to
return to school, there is an un
precedented scarcity of sophomores
in the office.
Accordingly, cold, efficient busi
ness manager Louis C. Ottenheimer
makes the announcement; that there
is a golden opportunity for some
ambitious sophomores—either male
or female—to get some good busi
ness experience in either office
practice or advertising management.
Aspirants may find Ihe business
manager at the Daily office any af
ternoon after 4 o'clock.
The Administration Building mail
man is one of the oldest timers on
the campus. He was walking the
Quad when Senator Stanford head
