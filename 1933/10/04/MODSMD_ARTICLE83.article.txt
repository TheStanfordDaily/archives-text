# Tributes Given Eric Krenz In Rites At Tahoe
## 
### 
Simple tribute was paid Eric
Krenz as the solemn notes of Taps
and the Stanford Hymn sounded
across the moonlit waters of Lake
yahoe early this summer.
Three trumpeters stood in the
bow of an excursion boat and hon
ored Stanford's ace athlete and
scholar who was drowned in the
water of Tahoe in July, 1931, as
more than 250 vacationists stood at
respective attention. The trumpet
er.-) were members of the Royal Car
dinals, Stanford dance band filling
a summer engagement, and the va
cationists, 250 persons who were
honoring a hero and a man.

Eric Krenz was drawned while
swimming in Emerald Bay, Lake
Tahoe, shortly after he graduated
from Stanford. During his univer
sity days Krenz, a champion shot
putter, inspired young athletes with
his physical prowess and students
with his scholastic record.

As the excursion boat turned into
Emeral Bay during a cruise around
the lake the students on board took
the opportunity to again honor a
Stanford man.
