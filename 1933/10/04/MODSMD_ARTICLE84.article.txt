# Fowl Play Seen As Meek Frosh Use Chanticleer
## 
### 
11:59 p.m. Saturday, September 30,
1933, one minute from the witching
hour â€” silence prevails, the awful
stillness before the birth of a new
day. The sharp, shrill cry of Chan
ticleer is heard, a bit off schedule.
Encina Hall awakes, with consider
able profanity.
A sponsor appears from nowhere,
clad in a nightgown.
"All right, all right. Bring in the
rooster."
Three meek frosh gulp in unison.
One of them goes to the window and
hauls in a somewhat bemused fowl.
"Where did you get that?"
"Down the road about a mile."
"Well, take it back and cut out the
racket."
Three meek frosh stuff the rooster
in a sack and bear it down the
stairs, through a lobby to a carriage
which awaits.
"What are we going to do with it
now?"
The Ramona Hotel looms up out
of the night.
"Let's take it in and put it in the :
elevator."
On the Stanford campus there are
nine sororities and 24 fraternities.
