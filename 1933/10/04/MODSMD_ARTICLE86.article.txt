# Row Houses Be-Decked For Coming "Season"
## 
### 
That bright, new building up the
Row, with its beaming inhabitants
proudly arrayed upon the brick
steps, is the new Phi Delt house,
most remarkable of recent changes
in campus topography. The summer
quarter saw the arrival of a wreck
ing crew which gently, tenderly
bore away the remains of the old
house. Building activities were
started immediately afterward and
the new home of the Phi Delts was
ready for their occupancy when au
tumn quarter began. Ask any Phi
Delt to describe it, if you have lots
of time to listen.

The other side of the street gives
evidence that the "800" are taking
their new numbers into account.
The repainted Chi Omega house has
a brand new sleeping porch—well
secluded behind thick trees. Over in
Roble Hall, the modern manner can
be observed in the new sets of bed
room furniture which have been in
stalled. The number of non-sorority
living groups has been increased

I from one to five, with the remodeled
i Union, Madrono Hall, and dormi-
I tories near the campus being pressed
| into service.
The Deke house strives for that
distinctive touch with a new coat of
j paint, still showing the campus what
I the well - dressed fraternity house
will wear. And the Theta Delts are
digging themselves out of the back
woods by chopping down the row
of wild cherry trees in front of
their house.
The Tri - Delts are ready for a
hard winter, having closed in and
painted their second - floor porch.
New paint glistens from the other
porches, window moldings, and
stairs.
The Gamma Phi's indicate their
hospitality and insure accessibility
with a new gravel driveway up on
Santa Ynez. The Alpha O's have
painted their porch, too; and rumor
has it that the Pi Phi's have new
back stairs, although the same ru
; mor neglects to mention the purpose
for which they are used.
