# Exchange Of Student Body Cards Taboo
## 
### 
With the intention of putting a
definite stop to a minor form of
racketeering which has manifested
itself in the past at football games,
Don E. Liebendorfer, official at the
Beard of Athletic Control, has an
nounced that there is to be no trans
fer of Stanford student body cards
for admission to the games.
All persons who are neither mem
bers of the student body nor on the
faculty must pay the full admission
price. Any student body cards
which are used by non-students for
admission will be immediately can
celled if discovered. This means
that all student body privileges will
be revbked, although it does not
mean the cancellation of registra
tion in the University.
