# Illustrated Review Outlet For Writers On Campus
## 
### 
Students interested in creative
writing have one good campus out
let for their work besides the Daily,
the Chaparral, and the Quad. The
Stanford Illustrated Review, edited
by Mrs. Carol Green Wilson, prints
articles on campus topics by under
graduate and graduate students.
Each issue of the Illustrated Re
view is nearly one - half student
written.
