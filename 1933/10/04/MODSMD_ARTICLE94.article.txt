# Mud Fight Set For Tomorrow
## 
### 
Mud—and perhaps fists—will fly
tomorrow when the men of '37 meet
the second-year men in the annual
fiosh-sophomore mud fight.
The place is the frosh football
field, the time is tomorrow after
noon and the exhibit is mud, mud,
and more mud.
It seems that the point of the
game is for the freshmen to throw
the sophs into one mud puddle,
while at the same time these sophs
are trying to throw the freshmen
into another mud puddle at the op
posite end of the field.
Puddle is perhaps too mild a
v/ord, for at each end of the field is
a pit twelve feet square and five
feet deep. The water in them is
cold, and very, very muddy.
The exceptionally large if not ex
ceptionally bright freshman class
makes the boast of the coming frosh
victory sound plausible. On the
other hand, the class of '36 won
last year, and is set to repeat.
Enthusiastic fireshmen, have al
ready organized in preparation for
the fray under the direction of En
cna sponsor Marvie Kahn. Tomor
row night at 7 o'clock all freshmen
will meet in Encina lobby to elect a
captain for the battle. The meeting
will be 'obligatory.

New and old members of the Rally
Committee are requested to report
to the frosh field on the day of the
mud fight with their red hats, as
they will be in charge of directing
the crowd.
