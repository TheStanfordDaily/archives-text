# Stanford Gets Acid Test Against Broncs Saturday
## Indian Team Expects Trouble Stopping Santa Clara's Reverse, Multiple-Spinner Touchdown Plays 
### BY SPUD HAMILTON 
Opening the 1933 season with two
not brilliant, but not unpromising
victories, Stanford's varsity foot
ballers on successive Saturdays de
feated San Jose State, 27-0, and
U.C.LA., 3-0. Coach "Tiny" Thorn
hill early in his new command has
given notice that this and future
Stanford teams will be anything but
dull, although they may lack some
of I lie subtlety of the plays of the
Warner era.
This coming Saturday the pres
ent Stanford Varsity gets its first
acid test—an encounter with a team
recognized as "plenty tough"—the
Santa Clara Bronco. Fast, scrap
ping, and hard-boiled, the Broncs
present a defence, twisting offense
chuck-full of such spectacular stuff
as "multiple spinners," "elevator
passes," "controlled defense," and
"coffin corner kicking."
Paglia Great Kicker
Such bye-words sound impres
sive to the laymen, but he need
only remember they connote a hard
bciled defensive team that boasts
the most extolled kicker on the
West Coast in Joe Paglia, terrific
speed to slash around the ends in
"Friky" Kaliski, a constant nrial
threat in Sobrero and Judnich, and
superlative blocking in Salatino.
Against the end-skirting threats
of Santa Clara's halfbacks "Frisky"
Kaliski and Sobrero, the Cardinal
ends who blossomed with such force
against San Jose and the Bruins
will undergo a tempestuous
noon. If "Monk" Moscrip and A1
Norgard can hammer down the
quick thrusts of Santa Clara's Sala
tino, deadly blocking quarter, then
Stanford's defensive halves will
have a clear track to bring down
the ball carrier; if Moscrip and Nor
gard fail to perform, then good bye
ball game.
Indians Under Wraps
Thornhill only half-pulled the
curtain in his opening game against
San Jose State on September 23,
and a goodly portion of the Thorn
hill offense was left well veiled.
Using a minimum of half a dozen
plays, the Cards displayed an
abundance of power and a plenti
tude of fumbles in out-maneuvering
the Teachers.

With ample room for improve
ment after the San Jo.se game, Stan
ford was able to display in their
first conference clash a driving,
! slugging offense that was good for
yards and yards in mid-field but
j which offended the spectators with
J that same lack of goal line punch
I evident in Stanford teams of late
j years.
With some justification, Stanford's
failure to score a touchdown after
i six invasions of the goal line border
' land was layed to improper quar
terbacking by the usual host of
; Monday morning signal callers.
Inexperienced Quarter
Some excuse might be gleaned
! from the facts that Bill Sim was
j calling signals in his first conference
' game as a quarter, and that Earl
| Hoos, his substitute, was playing his
j second game in varsity competition.
Aside from its deplorable inepti
tude in scoring touchdowns, the
Stanford team was impressive. A
charging line out-smote the Bruin
I and allowed gentlemen Alustiza,
Hillman, and Grayson, all three
punch-packing fullbacks, to con
! sistantly break through for short
gains; from his place at right "half
! the [plentifully publicized Bones
Hamilton demonstrated that his pre-
I game praise was not without cause,
| and after he left the game with a
i jaw injury which may keep him
, from play for a week or ten days,
Kenny Afflerbaugh kept up the
| pace. Afflerbaugh was responsible
for the longest run of the day when
he went over a perfect hole at right
; tackle and romped 37 yards to a
near touchdown.
Maentz Plays Well
Bob Maentz at left half played the
j most consistant game among the
Card backs. He passed, he punted,
and he hit off-tackle with .speed and
| elusiveness. Behind him, Johnny
! Reisner was dynamite on wheels,
| skirting the ends with terrific speed.
! Reisner got loose for a split second
i or two and ripped off a twenty-five
' yard punt return before the specta
j tors could gasp. Johnny put him
j self in bad for the rest of the season
; right there, because from now on
| this lad will be close]v watched by
the opposition. He is potentially able
to break up a ball game at any old
moment with his hip-twisting antics.
On defense, the Cardinals were
well-nigh perfect. The line rushed
U.C.L.A.'s Cheshire on his kicks
' until they were going all over the
lot, mostly where Cheshire didn't
want them to go; they rushed
famed passer Frankovich on his
passes until that flustrated youth
j shot three of them plunk into the
j arms of waiting Stanford men. Ham
ilton Bates, and O'Connor all inter
cepted his passes, thus providing
| breaks on which the offense was
unable to capitalize. They asked
Coach Thornhill before the game,
| "What are you going to do against
j the Bruins' passing game?" The re
sults adequately answer that one.
U.C.L.A. failed to complete a single
j pass!

not brilliant, but not unpromising
victories, Stanford's varsity foot
ballers on successive Saturdays de
feated San Jose State, 27-0, and
U.C.LA., 3-0. Coach "Tiny" Thorn
hill early in his new command has
given notice that this and future
Stanford teams will be anything but
dull, although they may lack some
of I lie subtlety of the plays of the
Warner era.
This coming Saturday the pres
ent Stanford Varsity gets its first
acid test—an encounter with a team
recognized as "plenty tough"—the
Santa Clara Bronco. Fast, scrap
ping, and hard-boiled, the Broncs
present a defence, twisting offense
chuck-full of such spectacular stuff
as "multiple spinners," "elevator
passes," "controlled defense," and
"coffin corner kicking."
Paglia Great Kicker
Such bye-words sound impres
sive to the laymen, but he need
only remember they connote a hard
bciled defensive team that boasts
the most extolled kicker on the
West Coast in Joe Paglia, terrific
speed to slash around the ends in
"Friky" Kaliski, a constant nrial
threat in Sobrero and Judnich, and
superlative blocking in Salatino.
Against the end-skirting threats
of Santa Clara's halfbacks "Frisky"
Kaliski and Sobrero, the Cardinal
ends who blossomed with such force
against San Jose and the Bruins
will undergo a tempestuous
noon. If "Monk" Moscrip and A1
Norgard can hammer down the
quick thrusts of Santa Clara's Sala
tino, deadly blocking quarter, then
Stanford's defensive halves will
have a clear track to bring down
the ball carrier; if Moscrip and Nor
gard fail to perform, then good bye
ball game.
Indians Under Wraps
Thornhill only half-pulled the
curtain in his opening game against
San Jose State on September 23,
and a goodly portion of the Thorn
hill offense was left well veiled.
Using a minimum of half a dozen
plays, the Cards displayed an
abundance of power and a plenti
tude of fumbles in out-maneuvering
the Teachers.

With ample room for improve
ment after the San Jo.se game, Stan
ford was able to display in their
first conference clash a driving,
! slugging offense that was good for
yards and yards in mid-field but
j which offended the spectators with
J that same lack of goal line punch
I evident in Stanford teams of late
j years.
With some justification, Stanford's
failure to score a touchdown after
i six invasions of the goal line border
' land was layed to improper quar
terbacking by the usual host of
; Monday morning signal callers.
Inexperienced Quarter
Some excuse might be gleaned
! from the facts that Bill Sim was
j calling signals in his first conference
' game as a quarter, and that Earl
| Hoos, his substitute, was playing his
j second game in varsity competition.
Aside from its deplorable inepti
tude in scoring touchdowns, the
Stanford team was impressive. A
charging line out-smote the Bruin
I and allowed gentlemen Alustiza,
Hillman, and Grayson, all three
punch-packing fullbacks, to con
! sistantly break through for short
gains; from his place at right "half
! the [plentifully publicized Bones
Hamilton demonstrated that his pre-
I game praise was not without cause,
| and after he left the game with a
i jaw injury which may keep him
, from play for a week or ten days,
Kenny Afflerbaugh kept up the
| pace. Afflerbaugh was responsible
for the longest run of the day when
he went over a perfect hole at right
; tackle and romped 37 yards to a
near touchdown.
Maentz Plays Well
Bob Maentz at left half played the
j most consistant game among the
Card backs. He passed, he punted,
and he hit off-tackle with .speed and
| elusiveness. Behind him, Johnny
! Reisner was dynamite on wheels,
| skirting the ends with terrific speed.
! Reisner got loose for a split second
i or two and ripped off a twenty-five
' yard punt return before the specta
j tors could gasp. Johnny put him
j self in bad for the rest of the season
; right there, because from now on
| this lad will be close]v watched by
the opposition. He is potentially able
to break up a ball game at any old
moment with his hip-twisting antics.
On defense, the Cardinals were
well-nigh perfect. The line rushed
U.C.L.A.'s Cheshire on his kicks
' until they were going all over the
lot, mostly where Cheshire didn't
want them to go; they rushed
famed passer Frankovich on his
passes until that flustrated youth
j shot three of them plunk into the
j arms of waiting Stanford men. Ham
ilton Bates, and O'Connor all inter
cepted his passes, thus providing
| breaks on which the offense was
unable to capitalize. They asked
Coach Thornhill before the game,
| "What are you going to do against
j the Bruins' passing game?" The re
sults adequately answer that one.
U.C.L.A. failed to complete a single
j pass!

speed to slash around the ends in
"Friky" Kaliski, a constant nrial

Against the end-skirting threats
of Santa Clara's halfbacks "Frisky"
Kaliski and Sobrero, the Cardinal
ends who blossomed with such force
against San Jose and the Bruins
will undergo a tempestuous
noon. If "Monk" Moscrip and A1
Norgard can hammer down the
quick thrusts of Santa Clara's Sala
tino, deadly blocking quarter, then
Stanford's defensive halves will
have a clear track to bring down
the ball carrier; if Moscrip and Nor
gard fail to perform, then good bye
ball game.
Indians Under Wraps
Thornhill only half-pulled the
curtain in his opening game against
San Jose State on September 23,
and a goodly portion of the Thorn
hill offense was left well veiled.
Using a minimum of half a dozen
plays, the Cards displayed an
abundance of power and a plenti
tude of fumbles in out-maneuvering
the Teachers.

With ample room for improve
ment after the San Jo.se game, Stan
ford was able to display in their
first conference clash a driving,
! slugging offense that was good for
yards and yards in mid-field but
j which offended the spectators with
J that same lack of goal line punch
I evident in Stanford teams of late
j years.
With some justification, Stanford's
failure to score a touchdown after
i six invasions of the goal line border
' land was layed to improper quar
terbacking by the usual host of
; Monday morning signal callers.
Inexperienced Quarter
Some excuse might be gleaned
! from the facts that Bill Sim was
j calling signals in his first conference
' game as a quarter, and that Earl
| Hoos, his substitute, was playing his
j second game in varsity competition.
Aside from its deplorable inepti
tude in scoring touchdowns, the
Stanford team was impressive. A
charging line out-smote the Bruin
I and allowed gentlemen Alustiza,
Hillman, and Grayson, all three
punch-packing fullbacks, to con
! sistantly break through for short
gains; from his place at right "half
! the [plentifully publicized Bones
Hamilton demonstrated that his pre-
I game praise was not without cause,
| and after he left the game with a
i jaw injury which may keep him
, from play for a week or ten days,
Kenny Afflerbaugh kept up the
| pace. Afflerbaugh was responsible
for the longest run of the day when
he went over a perfect hole at right
; tackle and romped 37 yards to a
near touchdown.
Maentz Plays Well
Bob Maentz at left half played the
j most consistant game among the
Card backs. He passed, he punted,
and he hit off-tackle with .speed and
| elusiveness. Behind him, Johnny
! Reisner was dynamite on wheels,
| skirting the ends with terrific speed.
! Reisner got loose for a split second
i or two and ripped off a twenty-five
' yard punt return before the specta
j tors could gasp. Johnny put him
j self in bad for the rest of the season
; right there, because from now on
| this lad will be close]v watched by
the opposition. He is potentially able
to break up a ball game at any old
moment with his hip-twisting antics.
On defense, the Cardinals were
well-nigh perfect. The line rushed
U.C.L.A.'s Cheshire on his kicks
' until they were going all over the
lot, mostly where Cheshire didn't
want them to go; they rushed
famed passer Frankovich on his
passes until that flustrated youth
j shot three of them plunk into the
j arms of waiting Stanford men. Ham
ilton Bates, and O'Connor all inter
cepted his passes, thus providing
| breaks on which the offense was
unable to capitalize. They asked
Coach Thornhill before the game,
| "What are you going to do against
j the Bruins' passing game?" The re
sults adequately answer that one.

Opening the 1933 season with two
not brilliant, but not unpromising
victories, Stanford's varsity foot
ballers on successive Saturdays de
feated San Jose State, 27-0, and
U.C.LA., 3-0. Coach "Tiny" Thorn
hill early in his new command has
given notice that this and future
Stanford teams will be anything but
dull, although they may lack some
of I lie subtlety of the plays of the
Warner era.
This coming Saturday the pres
ent Stanford Varsity gets its first
acid test—an encounter with a team
recognized as "plenty tough"—the
Santa Clara Bronco. Fast, scrap
ping, and hard-boiled, the Broncs
present a defence, twisting offense
chuck-full of such spectacular stuff
as "multiple spinners," "elevator
passes," "controlled defense," and
"coffin corner kicking."
Paglia Great Kicker
Such bye-words sound impres
sive to the laymen, but he need
only remember they connote a hard
bciled defensive team that boasts
the most extolled kicker on the
West Coast in Joe Paglia, terrific
speed to slash around the ends in
"Friky" Kaliski, a constant nrial
threat in Sobrero and Judnich, and
superlative blocking in Salatino.
