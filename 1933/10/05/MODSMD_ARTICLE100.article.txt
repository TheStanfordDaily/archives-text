# BOXERS PRACTICE FOR DECEMBER 5 NOVICE CONTESTS
## 
### 
With a novice tournament late in
the quarter, probably on December
5, as the only organized competi
tion this fall, eight veterans, two
transfers and many new men have
begun boxing workouts at Stanford
under Coach Myron Schall.
John Fowler and Stuart Stephens,
both lettermen, will be heavily
counted on in the winter and spring
v/hen the intercollegiate matches get
under way.
Other familiar faces at the first
practice Wednesday afternoon were
those of Tom Collins, Ben
Clarence de Vs-uve, and Leonard
Youdall. Collins, Cave, anc 1 de
Veuve all were on the varsity squad
last year. Youdall was a wrestler,
but he has shifted his activities to
thp fistic sport, and Schall predicts
big things for him.
Two others, although not varsity
men, looked good as freshmen dur
ing 1932-33. They are Lyman Breed
and Ralph Purdy; both are light
weights.
Jesse Worley, a 128-pound frosh
this year, brings a reputation with
him. His first year standing will
make him ineligible for varsity com
petition, however. Robert Moore, a
transfer from the U.S. naval acad
emy, who worked under Spike
Webb last year, is a finished pugi
list, in Schall's opinion. He is a
middleweight. Another skilled boxer
is Bill Sullivan, a lightweight trans
fer from the University of San
Francisco. The novice tournament
will be for the purpose of selecting
freshmen and others who have had
no varsity experience. Schall will
choose a first team at the close ol
this contest. He has set December 5
as the date for the novice tourney.
