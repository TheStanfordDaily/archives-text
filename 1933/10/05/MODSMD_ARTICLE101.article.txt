# Jake Butts To Replace Hill As Wrestling Coach
## 
### 
Under the leadership of Jake
Butts, who is filling the position left
vacant by Ted Hill, last year's wres
tling coach, a class of 25 would-be
grapplers turned out for the season's
first workout yesterday afternoon.
Two courses are open to those in
terested: one in advanced wrestling
for those having previous experi
ence and the other for beginning
grapplers.
Wrestling received a great impe
tus last year when Stanford entered
a team in the Minor Sports Carnival
at Berkeley, this being the first time
an Indian mat team had entered in
tercollegiate competition. This five
man team took second place by vir
tue of Jake Buit's work. A petition
was circulated at this time advocat
ing that wrestling be made a miner
sport on a par with boxing. This
petition was signed by 200 students
and came before the Ex Committee
for a decision. The committee passed
a resolution making this activity a
minor sport; however, the action
was later rescinded when it was dis
covered that the additional expense
could not be taken care of. If there
is enough interest shown in this
sport during the coming season,
wrestling may yet become a minor
sport in good standing.
