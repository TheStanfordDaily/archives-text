# California Promises To Be Coast Grid Threat
## 
### Frank Tremaine 
With an attack that smack', of va
liety as well as of power. California
with its first all-Ingrf.n coached
squad takes the field rhis year as
one of the tough<>' *A Pacific Coast
le; ms. * /
In lac' Tngi ajr, himself, as early
.*» August, caJ' -*d the Bears "the
most dangeror- team on the coast."
Despite the r *ct that California lost
to Sar.t: Z'nru, 7 to 0, in the open
ing game ihis year, they cannot yet
be out of the football pic
tuie, ,r jpecially as the Broncos are
not r conference team.
Vilh tj le possible exception of
S'/Uthern California and St. Mary's,
Jelifornia is reputed to have the
best material on the coast and if
man power is any indication of
strength, the Bears have it, with
four strings on the varsity squad,
thßamblers who are interchange
able with the varsity but play away
from home, and the goofs.
The injury jinx has hit Califor
nia already, Dave Meek, the giant
end; Capt. Johnny Ransome, ta'kle;
and Chili Bertoli, half, who was out
all last season, having been put out
of the game. However, replacements
are strong, and Meek, at least, may
be back in the line-up soon.
As usual Ingram has a strong for
ward wall, especially in the center
with Art Carlson and Howard Mor
ris at guards and "Red" Christie,
who merited all-Coast consideration
last year at center. Boone and Ran
some opened the season at tackles
but with the latter out, Lut:c, a
sophomore, has been filling in.
Boone may be shifted to guard.

Harry Jones and Dave Meek, both
lowering 6 feet 4 inches, and hover
ing around the 200-pound mark, Hie
ui ends.
A strong group of backs aids In
gram in his aim for u diversified at
tack. In line with this, "Navy Bill"
has decreed that his quarterbacks,
Chuck Stewart, Joe Verducci, and
Montford Reedy, must bark their
signals in the open rather than in a
buddle to enable them to size up the
defense and shape offensive strategy
accordingly.
Arleigh Williams, who was such
a sensation at times last season, is
one of the veteran halfbacks avail
able for use at Berkeley while
George Relies and Ken Mueller
have also returned. In addition, Cal
Varner,. a transfer from Fullerton
who starred against Nevada last
Saturday, and Floyd Blower, the
outstanding member of last year's
frosh, are expected to do big things.
Three veterans are being pushed
for the fullback berth by a sopho
more and a member of the 1932
goofs. Quisling, Keefer, Walker are
the veterans, Thorell, who seems to
have a slight edge so far, the .sopho
more, and Cotton is up from the
goofs.
