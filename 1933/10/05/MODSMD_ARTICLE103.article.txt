# "Eddie" O'Neill, Famous Chemistry Professor, Dies
## 
### 
Similar to the bereavement Stan
ford suffered recently when Profes
sor Everett Wallace Smith, head of
the Stanford journalism deaprtment,
died a short time ago, is the loss i
felt by University of California fac- i
ulty and students this morning 1
when they learned of the passing of
"Eddie" O'Neill, the "grand old man
of U.C."
Professor emeritus of chemistry,
Dr. O'Neill belonged to the famous
group of those who came early to
California, and included Benjamin
Ide Wheeler, Henry Morse Stephens,
and others prominent in California
public life.
Dr. O'Neill graduated from Cali
fornia with the class of '79. Almost
immediately afterward he joined the
faculty of the university as instruc
tor in chemistry. He held this po
sition until 1907, when he was made
professor of inorganic chemistry.
The famous educator's death came
shortly upon the greatest honor
tendered during his career by the j
university. At last commencement !
he was made an honorary doctor of
laws.
Dr. O'Neill was not only a cam
pus personality; he was held in high
esteem by experts in his own field.
He was widely known for research
work and chemical monographs, and
was recognized as a leader in his
profession.
Women are fine things in their
place but their place is not the law
steps.
