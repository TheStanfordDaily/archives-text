# Chappies, Daily Scribblers To Meet in Grid Classic
## 
### 
One of the choicest gridiroh treats j
j of the season will be presented to
local football fans when the Chap- i
anal Cougars meet the Daily Dag
gers in a thrilling, hair - raising, j
blood-curdling test of football prow
ess.
The Montana game will acts as a '
preliminary to the event which will j
i be staged in the Stanford Stadium i
, on November 18 —just one week be-
I fore the much heralded "Big Game" ;
| but frankly much superior to it in j
1 all the departments of the sport.
The Chaparral team will be cap- j
j tained by that demon of the grid- j
iron, that triple threat —Jim "Triple 1
Threat" Algar. The Daily team will j
be uncaptained. At least, no cap- j
tain has been announced at this {
date.
Rumor had it, however, that the j
Daily planned to out-fox the Stan- j
ford system of naming a new cap- ;
tain for each game by allowing each |
man to act as his own captain in i
every game. This was felt by the j
Daily coaching stall to be more j
democratic in principle and more j
wholesome in practice.
It might tend to disorganize the j
team a bit but this difficulty would j
be mere than offset by the added j
power to the Daily team in having j
eleven men to argue with the ref- j
ereo to but one for the Chaparral.
Botl] teams are in hiding at pres
ent but will soon present exclusive j
ai tides written exclusively by the !
respective coaches exclusively for
the Daily.

The "500" kept clear of the law
sttps. Their younger sisters must
be similarly disciplined, i
