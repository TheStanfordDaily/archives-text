j Eager to fill the shoes of departed
; forensic greats, over half a hundred
j Stanford men and women last night
! craned necks to eper past 202's mid
, room pillars and hear plans for one
I of the most elaborate debate seasons
1 in Farm history.
Laughter shook the already shaky
j walls when it was announced that
j the San Quentin debate, scheduled
j for November 12, would be held on
I the prison campus; that there would
: be no opportunity for a return en
j gagement.
The half a hundred showed keen
! interest as Debate Adviser Lee Cha
i pin spoke of possibilities for a real
j women's debate squad, a squad
{ which should be made a reality be
-1 cause of the fenjede* influx this fall.
' V/inner of last year's JofTre Medal
! Debate, Mary K. Morris, was on
I hand to make the few woman pros-
I peets feel at home in a classroom

crowded with men. She urged men
and women to arouse latent enthu
siasm for an active women's squad.
Grave grow the Stanford students
as Professor William Hawley Davis
pleaded lor forensic sincerity, a
quality too often lacking in feverish
debate, to be the keynote of the cur
rent season's work.
Already debaters have begun
work in the competition for places
on the teams which will meet both
men's and women's teams from Ber
keley across the Bay. Subject for
the three - man Stanford - California
contest: "Resolved, That students
at Stanford and California should
pledge themselves to refuse to par
ticipate in any further war.'' Ques
tion for the unusual debate in which
roughs will tussle forensically with
the pick of Cal's woman orators:
"Resolved, That the D.A.R. should
continue to exist."
