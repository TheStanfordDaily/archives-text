BERKELEY, Oct. 5 (P.I.P.)â€”"No
corsages," was the recent verdict of
Junior Day heads at the University
lof California when pressed for a
j decision as to whether or not flowers
were to be in order for the Junior
Prom.
"The male faction of the class is
hard hit by the depression and we
\ have listened to its protests," de
| dared the chairman.
Since ever and ever, law steps
were free of pink ribbons and
I sports ensembles. For ever and
'ever, this must be the rule.
