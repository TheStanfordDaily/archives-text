# FAGAN OPPOSES PENNY-SNATCHING TAX AS UNSOUND

Copper slocks and state treasuries
may reap the benefits of the many
'sales taxes" which have recently
deluged the country, but when in
the form that our well-known Cali
fornia one takes they become a nui
sance to individuals.
However, deeper than mere in
convenience lie the objections
raised by the many opponents of the
tax. Professor Elmer Fagan, of the
Stanford Economics Department,
numbers himself among these. "I
am opposed to a general sales tax
in principle," he avers.
In justifying his stand, he con
tinues, "Such a tax, if it is to be
had at all, should at least be selec
tive. Otherwise it is discriminatory
in its effect on different products."
"Discrimination is not the major
objection, though," he added. "Such
a tax takes no account whatsoever
of the ability of the citizen to pay
the tax burden. Only those com
modities that conform to the 'ability
to pay' principle should be taxed.'
The payment of taxes in accord
ance with ability to bear the burden
has always been a cardinal economic
principle, from which the depres
sion-bred sales taxes have been the
most radical departures.
