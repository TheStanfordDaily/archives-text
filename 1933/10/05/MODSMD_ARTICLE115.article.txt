# Dance Receipts To Send Douglass To Convention
## 
### 
Profits of Sigma Delta Chi's Reg
istration Dance will be turned over
toward the expense of sending Don
Douglass, president of the organiza
tion, to the national convention of
the journalistic fraternity. This
meeting is to be held in Chicago at
the same time as the Stanford-
Northwestern game.
The Registration Dance brought a
gross return into the treasury of
$370, besides being an unusual dance
in several other respects. Expenses
for the dance, planned by Jim Algar,
Chappie funny man and Sigma
Delta Chi member, amounted to
$115.
