# "Daily" Seeks New Material
## First Meeting Will Be Held Tonight; Press Bldg. 
### 
New blood for the veins of the
Daily is the goal of the tryout pe
riod which opens with a preliminary
at 7:30 o'clock tonight up
stairs in the Press Building.
An opportunity to learn to write
a news story coupled with experi
ence in a wide variety of phases of
the journalistic field is open to all
freshmen and all students.
At the initial meeting neophytes
will be acquainted with the tryout
period program and given a brief
sketch of what is expected of a
Daily reporter by Molly Phillips,
woman's editor, in charge of tryout
ees. Throughout the trials she will
be assisted by Bob Letts and Rolph
Malloch, associate editors.
Great opportunity for rapid ad
vancement exists on the Daily and
every member of the staff is able
to fiVid some particular field of in
terest to him. From the ranks of
the reporters copy readers are cho
sen at the end of each volume.
From copy reading the man may
go to a night editor's post and from
there to an editorial board position.
During the trials cuts will be
made from time to time in the num
ber of tryoutees, but the final num
ber admitted at the end of about a
week will be large.
Meanwhile, Louis Ottenheimer,
business manager of the Daily, is
sued a call for tryoutees for the
ranks of the Daily business staff.
Many positions are open and plen
ty of freshman men and women and
sophomore candidates are wanted.
All would-be business staff mem
bers will meet in the offices of the
business department tonight at 7
o'clock.
The business staff offers remark
able opportunities for advancement,
according to Ottenheimer. Two lines
of work are accessible to all who
seek to rise in the business world of
the campus.
Tryoutees are offered work either
in the selling and planning of ad
vertisements or, if they prefer, office,
secretarial, and bookkeeping work.
Ottenheimer pointed out that op
portunity is afforded to balance a
curricular career with business ex
perience on the campus. The busi
ness opportunities exist for the cam
-1 us. It is a part of what individual
tuition checks go for.
Then, too, the business manager
pointed out, after two years of train
ing, several positions with substan
tial monthly salaries are open to
those who care to continue with the
work. Academic credit is also giveh
by the University.
Clapping at all women who tran
gress on the famous law steps must
be louder in the future.
