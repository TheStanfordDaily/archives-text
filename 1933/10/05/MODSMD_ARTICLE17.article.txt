showed familiar female reticence,
a group of new campus women,
latest members of the "800,"
showed willingness to state why
they thought the woman's place
is in the university instead of in
the home.
Barbara Patton—To further my
knowledge. I always intended to
come to college. Well, I suppose
there were social reasons.
Catherine Jennings—To get col
lege life and experience. To find
out what I want to do later on and
to get a general knowledge.
Betty Stearns—To get an educa
te n—seriously.

I wanted a higher education. I don't
any other reason than that.
Betty Wheeler—Practicaly have to
have a college education to get any
sort of a job.
Barbara Sweet—High school edu

ness or social life. Came here for
both social life and to help in earn
ing a living.
Mary Welch—For an intellectual
