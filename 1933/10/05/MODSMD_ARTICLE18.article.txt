# Men's Rush Rules Aired
## 
### 
"Normal contact of public and in
formal nature."
That phrase describes the rela
tionship permissible between Greeks
and freshmen prior to formal rush
i'.'j d' tes.
Tne interpretation of that short
phrase brought to a stalemate, the
fivst meeting of the Inter-Frater
nity council last night.
A year ago, the council might not
have been bothered by that phrase
as it amiably established meaning
less agreements. But violations were
penalized last year and words are
now a fighting matter.
The matter of interpreting was re
ferred to a committee appointed by
Inter-Fraternity Council Chairman
Don Tatum, headed by Wheeler Co
berly. Other members who will con
template the moot point are Duncan
Mc√üryde, Frank Booth, and Jack
Freeman.
The sub-committee is expected to
have a report ready for Tatum to
hand to the Inter-Fraternity board
with whom final decision lies, when
it meets one week from tonight.
Tatum reiterated that off campus
rushing is permissible only during
Thanksgiving anel Christmas vaca
tions. He also stressed that not only
will fraternities be penalized if vio
lations are reported, but freshmen
will also be punished severely as
(he case warrants.
Three two-day rushing periods
will be held November 3 and 4, De
comber 5 and G, January 9 and 10,
with a final four-day rushing pejriod
January 15-19 climaxed by pledg
ing on the last day.
Inter-Fraternity councilmen ap
pointed A1 Peache to represent them
ar the National Inter-Fraternity
Conference in Chicago, October 14
arid 15. Peache will be in Chicago
at that date, traveling there as yell
leader to the Stanford-Northwestern
football game.
No decision has yet 'been made on
whether the class a house can take
will be limited in number. Action
on the question is expected soon,
but not immediately.
