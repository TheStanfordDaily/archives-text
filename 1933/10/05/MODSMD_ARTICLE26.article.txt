# Dr. Swain's 'Toy' Train Proves Gibb's Theorem

Freshmen entering chemistry lab
â–  oratories this week for the first
Itime, and trying to become accus
tomed to the rows of acid bottles
and the not-too-pleasant gases em-
I anating from apparatus on all sides,
| probably feel that they are a long
I ways from home.
Perhaps they would not feel so
far from home if they could gain
access to the locked room in the
Chemistry basement, and watch Dr.
Robert C. Swain's mechanical train
in action. Dr. Swain, son of Robert
| Eckles Swain, does not use the train
I to while away leisure hours, how
' ever, but performs many careful
' experiments with it in order to
i prove complicated theories that
I meny Chemistry majors cannot at
' tempt to explain.
| Working as a National Research
i Council Fellow, Dr Swain has re
cently completed his experimenting
[with this "train" and has proved

1 hr. Gibbs Absorbtion Theorem,
which has been "only theory" since
it;, postulation 50 years ago.
The Gibbs Absorbtion Theorem
states principally that the top layer
(it any solution is of a different con
centration than the main body of
the liquid. In order to test this, a
track and "watering trough" of sil
ver had to be made and measured
to 3 10,000 of an inch.
Over the track the train was pro
pelled at the rate of 35 feet a sec
ond, through automatically opening
doors, into the central chamber
which was saturated with the vapor
of the solution to be tested. As the
train passed over the trough of so
lution, its razor like edge scraped
off a layer of 1-10 millimeter thick,
and concentration of this solution
carefully measured.
Dr. Swain obtained very accurate
remits from his experiments and
has presented several papers on this
sr.hject to scientific .societies.
