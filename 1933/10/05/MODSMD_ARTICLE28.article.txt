# Daily Building's Interior Renovated During Summer
## 
### 
Public works, one of the means
used by the present administration
in pulling us out of the depression,
has received infinite support from
the Daily in recent physical im
provements to the newspaper build
ing.
Shelves were built to house the
bound volumes of the Daily, dating
byck to the earliest days of the Uni
versity, and locks were placed on
the editorial doors to insure lhat
these volumes remain on the newly
made shelves.
New railings were installed in the
cffice, the bulletin board was
painted, and various wooden files
were repaired.
