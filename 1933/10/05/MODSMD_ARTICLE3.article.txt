# Taps for 27 Jobless
## 
### 
Roaring through the tinder-dry
brush of Lo.s Angeles' Griffith Park,
a disastrous fire claimed the lives
of 27 RFC unemployment relief
workers. A hundred more were se
verely burned. Reason for the heavy
fatalilies: inexperience of the men
in fighting fires. Nearly all those
killed or injured were trapped in a
bc.x-like canyon when shifting winds
sent the fire toward them.
Cause of the disaster still unde
termined; probably a carelessly dis
carded cigarette. Interesting discov
ery by investigators: one R. D. Barr,
2fl, intoxicated, arrived too late to
help fight the fire, so started a few
blazes of his own.
