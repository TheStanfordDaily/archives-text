# Why Are We Here Anyway?

'I hc Registrar's Office can now lapse back into quiet
normalcy the mad madness of registration being com
pleted. Some three thousand of lis have finally signed the
little hooks and signified our intention to remain for the
quarter.
In a vague sort of wav, we know that if we attend a
fair number of classes and read a few pages, we will he
hack next quarter. Hut of course this isn't so boring, for
there are always football games on Saturday to look for
ward to and football games of last Saturday to reminisce
upon.
And those who feel above the elemental appeal of foot
ball, may content themselves with Y.M.G.A. cabinets, Chap
arral, the Daily, or some "outside activity." Hut of course
this is just another way of dodging the issue;
I'.ven those who reveal the bloody cartilage by keeping
their noses rubbing on the scholastic grindstone are not
entirely sure why they are here. They can see that certain
important facts are being accumulated. They know that
Plato was a Greek, and the Greeks were a great people,
and people are necessary. They learn that Adam Smith
was an economist, that he died in and that he is no
relation to Alfred K. Smith.
Hut what of it? What does it mean? Is the mastering
of these facts any justification for staying in this delight
ful spot? It is obvious that the answer is "no." Otherwise,
why all this editorial fuss about the problem? And some
might say, "Why any fuss, anyway?"
The annoyance is that if the freshman (or even a soph
omore) were ever given some purpose upon which to hang
his labors, the labor would be fun and worthwhile as well.
As il is, he meanders through the four years and finally
peters out and is lost in that great ocean called Life (with
a capital "L").
The stuff he learns (education) either rolls off his back
like the traditional w-at<jr off of the traditional mallard's
back or sticks to him like so many barnacles. And has
about that much value.
As far as any change, any disturbance, in his internal
structure none. His entire university education has been
mechanical; never chemical. The effort to acquire is there
- sometimes. Hut blind acquiring of facts is worthless
without some purpose to give meaning to what is learned.
And as for those who come alone for the football or the
activities, they are pure waste without even hope of being
saved.
