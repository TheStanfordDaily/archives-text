# Voluntary Over Compulsory
## 
### 
There are some controversial subjects which seem never
to gel settled. There is the old question about the chicken
and the egg. There is also the constantly recurring one of
compulsory military training.
The latter has come up for argument again, this time
;il the t Diversity of California at Los Angeles. The parents
of two freshman men have retained a lawyer and are
threatening a test case in court because their sons are re
quired to take military training. The students in question
| claim to be pacifists, and asked the university for exemp
tion as conscientious objectors. t'.C.L.A. authorities de
livered an ultimatum of attendance at R.O.T.C. or expul
sion.
Whatever the merits of this particular case, or of the
' innumerable similar cases, the importance for Stanfordites
\ lies in the fact that on this campus we have no such prob
lem. Stanford is an independent institution, not subject to
state control, and thus military training is up to the stu
dents. Kacli individual may take it or leave it, as he
chooses.
Since the difference between the number of students
who voluntarily take H.O.T.C'., and the number who could
be compelled to take it, is not great enough to endanger
the security of the United States, Stanford is to be con
gratulated on avoiding this easy subject for bickering and
dissension.
Students who enjoy inarching up and down again in a
uniform under the hot sun, and riding around on a gun
while staring at the tail end of a horse, have the privilege
(;I doing so. Students who feel an instinctive distaste for
this sort of thing mav also follow the dictates of their con
science. Thus argument is avoided and all Stanford may
work together in common interests.
