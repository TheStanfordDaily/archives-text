# The 						NRA Must Win

### 
The National Recovery Administration is not the most
pleasant bracer the nation might swallow. The Daily has
joined in full spirit, however, for the simple reason that
this depression of four years standing is growing increas
ingly unpleasant.
The prospect of its going on for another four years is
even more unpleasant. The NHA is, a hope hut not ;i 11
hopes should he followed. Technocracy was a hope. And
Iluey I-ong is full of them.
Hut the NHA is a hope and, what is more important, it
is a rational hope. It should he supported because il is
sound in that il seeks fundamentally to holster buying
power. F.ventuallv, that is the only way to lift ourselves
without a complete radical overturn involving a readjust
ment of wealth.
