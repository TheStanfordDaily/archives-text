THE SUMMER SEASON: I—The
Palo Alto Community Players.
By far the most important local
theatrical event of the summer was
the opening of the Palo Alto Com
munity Theatre. The gift of Mrs.
Louis Stern, it was presented to the
eiiy and accepted formally on July
Bth. The theatre itself possesses a
comfortable auditorium (capacity
428) and splendid backstage facili
ties. It is situated on Middlefield
Road at Melville Avenue.
The Players have given four full
length productions thus far: "Grum
py," "Growing Pains," "Interfer
ence," and "Nine Till Six." They
have, as well, presented a bill of
original one-act plays.
"Grumpy," faded as its initially
uncertain glories are, may be dis
missed upon the grounds of senti
ment. "Growing Pains," a blight
little comedy of adolescence by
Stanfordite Aurania Rouverol, re
ceived its premiere production here
and was subsequently produced at
the Pasadena Playhouse. There its
two scheduled weeks were extended
to three. Lee Schubert has taken
the play for New York production
early this season.
"Interference" was handled indif
ferently by a large but raw cast to
which the English nuances were a
mystery. "Nine Till Six" was an al
most plotless play in a ladies' com
mercial establishment which an all
fernale cast made surprisingly—but
not greatly—entertaining. A bad
p!?.y, deficie nt, at once in humor and
moving force, the surprise lay in
th;.' fact that the cast could make it

at all interesting.
Thus iar the plays selected have
been typical of the average little
theatre which, working on a small
budget, is rather justifiably afraid
to do a great deal of experiment.
The production of "Growing Pains,"
although essentially a commercial
play, and of a hastily and inexpen
sively staged group of original one
act plays do, however, indicate the
presence of some promising initia
tive. —Sandoe «•
