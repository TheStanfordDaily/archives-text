# NEW ART COURSES OFFERED AS PART OF FALL PROGRAM
## 
### Will Williams 
The first steps toward the realiza
tion of a goal, originally advocated
in the editorial columns of the Stan
ford Daily, have been made with the
presentation this year of courses in
Ait and Archaeology, sponsored by
the School of Letters.
Following the Daily's editorial, a
petition was drawn up by the mem
bers of the English Club, which was
signed by so many students that it
was decided to offer new courses in
the departments of Art and Archae
ology to determine whether or not
the response would make worth
while the creation of a new depart
ment.
Faculty Reaction
At the time the petition was open
for signers in the English office, Dr.
Kurt F. Reinhardt, Professor of
German Literature and Civilization
at Stanford, sent letters to more
than fifty faculty members in de
partments related to these subjects,
to discover their views on the addi
tion to the curriculum of courses
designed to familiarize the student
with the principles and modes of
artistic expression. These letters
met with enthusiastic response. "In
not one case, did I meet with any
opinions to the contrary," said Dr.
Reinhardt. The result is lhat the
faculty members giving these new
courses are devoting their time and
energy without compensation.
Dr, Reinhardt himself is offering
a course, "The Introduction to the
Appreciation of Art," which is de
signed for the general student. This
course has never been given before
and is at present registered as course
95 in the Germanic Languages de
partment. It is offered with the in
tention of cultivating artistic taste
and the sense of aesthetic judgment,
and to demonstrate the interrelation
of art and civilization. Says Dr.
Reinhardt, "All students are wel
come, lower as well as upper class
men, for whom it is equally im
portant.
"The course is calculated, in a
very simple way, to teach people
how to approach art. We have in
the past been so one-sided that I am
really very happy to see the reali
zation of the importance of the de
velopment of this cultural side." Dr.
Reinhardt has been at the School of
Architecture and allied arts at the
University of Oregon for several
years. He received his training at
Munich, the important art center of
Germany.
Archaeology Course
Another n'ew course, in archaeol
ogy, is offered by the Classical Lit- 1
erature department. It is the "His- I
tory of Greece," which is intended
to serve as ,an introduction to the
course in Greek Archaeology to be j
offered next quarter. In these |
courses, special emphasis will be j
placed on the cultural history and j
development of Greece. There is
also given this quarter Classical
Literature course C2OO, Journal Club
in Greek Archaeology, which may j
be taken for one or two units.
For students interested, attention i
is also called to the general courses
in the Graphic Art Department, GO '
and IGO, the History of Painting, !
which is a general survey of paint- i
ing from medieval times to the pres- 1
ent day, given with lantern slides j
and critical lectures. In these j
courses, special attention is paid to 1
the composition and style of expres- '
sion characteristic of the artist.
In the Philosophy Department, Dr. I
Harold Chapman Brown is giving a j
course in Aesthetics, which is de- I
voted to the principles of harmony j
and rhythm and the modes of aes- I
thetic expression.
