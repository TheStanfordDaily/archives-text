# REINHARDT TO DISCUSS PHILOSOPHY, CIVILIZATION
## 
### 
Confronting the claims and de
mands of common-sense philosophy
with a series of lectures on Scholas
i ticism, old and new, Dr. Kurt F.
Reinhardt, Professor of German
Literature at Stanford, will show
the relation of philosophy to prob
lems of modern civilization, in a
j California Extension Division course
titled "Scholastic Philosophy and
j Modern Life."
Dr. Reinhardt believes that "in
ths last analysis, the scholastic an
| swer to the eternal quest for truth
i is based on a philosophy whose ba
i sic principles are of perennial valid
ity, and, therefore, offer the unfail
ing clue for light conduct in
temporal affairs."
Goal of Scholasticism
In this course Dr. Reinhardt will
shew that the final goal of the new
scholasticism is to reconcile tradi
tion and progress "in the complete
harmonization of the venerable old
I and the admirable new."
Dr. Reinhardt came to this coun
try in 1928, after receiving his Ph.D.
from the University of Freiburg in
Germany. For two years he was a
; member of the German Department
and the School of Architecture and
Allied Arts at the University of j

Oregon, Eugene, Oregon.

Mysticism, aside from numerous
