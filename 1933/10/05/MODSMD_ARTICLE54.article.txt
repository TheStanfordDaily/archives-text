# DAILY WRITER OUTLINES CAREER OF WALTER WINCHELL, LANGUAGE CREATOR
## 
### Beecher Kellogg 
Though he scooped the world in
forecasting the first Lindbergh baby,
Broadway's wisecracking Walter
Winchell missed one blessed event.
It happened back in 1897 when a
Mrs. Winchell gave birth to an
eight-pound New Yorker who was
soon to set the elite and the not so
elite talking — talking a slanguage
that said things they'd always want
ed to say but didn't know quite how.
Walter Winchell has made a niche
for himself in American journalism
not because he can talk so that
banker and the man in the sewer
can both understand him, but be
cause he has discovered that Broad
way is just a village and that Amer
icans like petty gossip. He came
into newspaper work at the time
when personalities were being for
gotten and it took a national calam
ity to make the front page. Win
chell broke all the codes news edi
tors could dig up and foretold di
vorces, remarriages, family spats
and babies as soon as he heard the
news. He changed the conceptions
of news values.
Because he wanted to work Win
chell stopped school in this thir
teenth year in the 08, P.S. 184. He
sang in a quartet in a dumpy nick
elodeon with Eddie Cantor and
Georgie Jessel. Later a vaudeville
manager took them uptown, turned

them into a sextet and paid them
$15 per week. Walter Winchell
earned another $2 as stage manager.
After a wartime in the Navy Win
chell did a dance and patter ad for
Pantages circuit and in this jumble
of one-night stands originated Win
chell's present-day column. On a
rattly typewriter he turned out two
editions a day of his "The Daily
News Sense" which he tacked to the
bulletin board near trouper mail
boxes. It contained such stuff as
"What was Eddie doing up in Ma
bel's room at 3 o'clock this morn?"
The editor of Vaudeville News
saw a copy and before many months
Winchell was doing Broadway for
the News. And on the side collect
ing ads. As the picture tabloids
sprang to life in 1924, Winchell went
to work for Mcfadden's Graphic but
soon ticked a typewriter on the Mir
ror for a salary that had been upped
to $GOO per week. (Today he banks
close to $5000 per.)
Still on the Mirror staff, Winchell
writes a column that doesn't try to
inform or create but merely to in
terest. Winchellian copy is nothing
more than a newsman talking to
himself in the language he knows.
All America talks his slang when
they say "is my face red?", "you
dope," "giggle water," "blessed
event," and "Reno-vated."

and babies as soon as he heard the
news. He changed the conceptions
of news values.
Because he wanted to work Win
chell stopped school in this thir
teenth year in the 08, P.S. 184. He
sang in a quartet in a dumpy nick
elodeon with Eddie Cantor and
Georgie Jessel. Later a vaudeville
manager took them uptown, turned

them into a sextet and paid them
$15 per week. Walter Winchell
earned another $2 as stage manager.
After a wartime in the Navy Win
chell did a dance and patter ad for
Pantages circuit and in this jumble
of one-night stands originated Win
chell's present-day column. On a
rattly typewriter he turned out two
editions a day of his "The Daily
News Sense" which he tacked to the
bulletin board near trouper mail
boxes. It contained such stuff as
"What was Eddie doing up in Ma
bel's room at 3 o'clock this morn?"
The editor of Vaudeville News
saw a copy and before many months
Winchell was doing Broadway for
the News. And on the side collect
ing ads. As the picture tabloids
sprang to life in 1924, Winchell went
to work for Mcfadden's Graphic but
soon ticked a typewriter on the Mir
ror for a salary that had been upped
to $GOO per week. (Today he banks
close to $5000 per.)
Still on the Mirror staff, Winchell
writes a column that doesn't try to
inform or create but merely to in
terest. Winchellian copy is nothing
more than a newsman talking to
himself in the language he knows.
All America talks his slang when
they say "is my face red?", "you
dope," "giggle water," "blessed
event," and "Reno-vated."
Though he scooped the world in
forecasting the first Lindbergh baby,
Broadway's wisecracking Walter
Winchell missed one blessed event.
It happened back in 1897 when a
Mrs. Winchell gave birth to an
eight-pound New Yorker who was
soon to set the elite and the not so
elite talking — talking a slanguage
that said things they'd always want
ed to say but didn't know quite how.
Walter Winchell has made a niche
for himself in American journalism
not because he can talk so that
banker and the man in the sewer
can both understand him, but be
cause he has discovered that Broad
way is just a village and that Amer
icans like petty gossip. He came
into newspaper work at the time
when personalities were being for
gotten and it took a national calam
ity to make the front page. Win
chell broke all the codes news edi
tors could dig up and foretold di
vorces, remarriages, family spats
and babies as soon as he heard the
news. He changed the conceptions
of news values.
