# Chrysanthemum Tea Will Be Held By Mothers' Club
## 
### 
November 1 is the date set by the
Mothers' Club of Stanford Univer
sity for its annual Chrysanthemum
Tea. The event will be held this
year at the new women's gymna
sium on the campus instead of at
the Herbert Hoover house, which
has been the attractive setting for
several years.
Although an invitation was ex
tended to the club by Mr. and Mrs.
Hoover, who were willing to open
their home for the tea again, it was
felt by the executive board that it
would be unwise to accept. Since
the house is now filled with valuable
personal property of the Hoovers,
the club feels that too great a risk
would be involved in throwing open
the doors to the public.
The new gymnasium, with its
beautiful inner court and its large
auditorium, was decided upon as an
ideal setting for the tea. According
to plans worked out at a meeting of
the executive board yesterday, Mrs.
Thomas A. Storey and Mrs. Almon
E. Roth will be co-chairmen of the
general bommittee.
Mrs. Frank Weber of Los Altos
and Mrs. John Holman will have
charge of the fashion show, which
will be a feature of the tea. Mrs.
Ernest Paul Hunt will act as chair
man of the refreshments committee
and Mrs. Chester G. Vernier of the
candy sale. Chrysanthemums will
also be sold.
Tickets, at $1, will be sold under
the direction of Mrs. C. H. Dan
forth.
