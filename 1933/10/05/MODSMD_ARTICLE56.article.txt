# Stewart To Give Course In Writing For Magazines
## 
### 
An interesting novelty in the field
of educating students for practical
work in the magazine trade is being
! given this quarter by Kenneth Ste
wart, former "Daily" editor, and in
structor of journalism here. It's title
is Journalism 134: "Feature Arti
cle."
Members of the class will write
all their articles with a definite mar
ket in mind; after consultation with
the instructor, and necessary revi
sions are made, the articles will be
sent to the markets planned.
Students will be required to write
three articles of between 3,000 and
5,000 words. They will be given the
! privilege of choosing their own sub
j jects and markets. The course meets
, Tuesdays and Thursdays from 2 to
| 4 o'clock.
, Is nothing holy? Will high French
heels scrape the sacred sandstone
of the law steps?
