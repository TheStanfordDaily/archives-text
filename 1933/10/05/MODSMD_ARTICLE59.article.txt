### 
That the way to a man's heart is
through his stomach was proved
just after lunch yesterday when cul
inary commercialism assumed the
importance of a Goethe recital on
the bulletin boards of the Germanic
Languages Department. The pla
cards, still there at the dinner hour
last night, bespoke the merits of
"eld country" table board at a
down-town hostelry.
