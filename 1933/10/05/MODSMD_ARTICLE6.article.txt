# Mobs vs. Law
## 
### 
Lawless Lodi was still at it yes
terday. The armed mob, which
drove strike leaders out the previous
day, continued on parade; guns were
out; remaining agitators, if any, kept
to the bushes. The Law-forces re
mained singularly inactive, contin
uing, however, to hold 35 men in
jail on the time-worn but conven
ient charge, "conspiracy to obstruct
the law." Peaceful strikes are legal
in I his as in many states.

Modesto had the horrid habit too.
Night riders were gayly chasing
Filipino lettuce - pickers (usually
brought here on contract, usually
pretty homesick, anyhow) over the
county. Careful night - riders had
taken liccnse plates off their cars.
Cautious Sheriff's office had done
nothing.
Gilroy's fame spread when un
known nasty - bodies dynamited a
Filipino-occupied bunkhouse, stuffed
a stove with dynamite sticks which
a horrified cook discovered. Nobody
being hurt and only a few Filipinos
being frightened, nothing will prob
ably be done in race-conscious Gil
roy either.
