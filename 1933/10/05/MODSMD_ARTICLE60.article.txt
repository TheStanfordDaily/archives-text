# California Savants Teach Farmers Disking Devices
## 
### 
The University of California, Fis
ter institution to Stanford, hits
cropped up with another device to
decrease premature gray hairs on
the heads of farmers. Agricultural
experts, for many years, have be
lieved that they knew the latest
word in the use of disk harrows.
But classroom savants of the
Berkeley institution have shown
the farmers up at their own game,
A series of University demonstra
tions has shown how a "deep gauge"
works, and that the use of a disk
without a gauge is a sad mistake.
Disking fields without the use of
gauges, according to California edu
cators, has at times produced
strange, bizarre results. One farmer
sliced the roots of the base of a
iree, and the tree fell on him. Two
more, involved in similar accidents,
ruined their own water pipe and
tankhouse systems.
The California professors, most of
whom have never harrowed a field,
are showing just how far a disk
should go underground; just what
engle and depth at which the de
vice will cut weeds.
A disking machine is not supposed
to be used to dig a ditch, affirm the
California teachers, and they in
tend to prove their point.
