I BYSTANDER-Maxim Gorki
Clim Samghin, the Bystander, ma-
I lures in an environment of the Rus
j sian middle classes. He feels and
participates in the unrest, the men
tal fever, and the extreme individual
selfishness of Czarist Russian life.
He searches for the realization of
personal happiness through love . . .
the typically Russian "trial and er
ror" method. His personal air cas
tles are shattered. ... He builds an
ideal for the realization of a Russian
national happiness, with the young
Czar Nicholas II as the Atlas sup
porting this imperial unit. But when
he sees the young Czar his ideals for
the unification of Imperial Russia
also come tumbling down: for, "the
Czar appears to be a man sharing
the mental instability of other Rus
sians."
In Bystander Gorki reveals a ka
leidoscopic view of the thinking and
feeling of the Russian people which
culminated in the Revolution and
subsequent rule of Communism. As
a panoramic view of Czarist Russian
life, Bystander is remarkable. Il is
filled with vigorous scenes and with
conversation which stimulates one
to think vigorously about important
social problems.
The weakness of this novel lies in
its rather loose, shapeless construc
tion. It has very little cadence or
decadence; little change of tempo.
Bystander flows as a quiet stream
with conversations that make one
think deeply and scenes that make
one feel deeply.

LITTLE MAN. WHAT NOW?—By
Hans Fallada. Simon and Schus
ter. $2.50.
The translation of Mr. Falluda's
novel, besides furnishing much ex
cellent reading, gives a firm criti
cism of the situation in Germany
from the standpoint of the little man
whose life depends on the fluctu
ations of trade and prosperity.
Filled with human sympathy and
human humor, the story transcends
these emotions, as far as the reader
is concerned, by giving an account
of despair, both personal and na
tional, which besets the German
people and the nation—yet
an account which is without reason
less despair.
Social criticism, when accompa
nied by the bitterness which im
plies a failure to understand, and an
unwillingness to understand, gen
erally fails in its purpose.
Because the author maintains a
cheerful attitude toward life, even

il il is a pessimistic cheerfulnesajl
the American reader, acquainted j
with similar despair translated into 1
terms of American civilization, is 1
satisfied by the performance.
The entertainment vaiue is en- m
hanced by one of the finest charac
terizations of modern German liter
ature, Bunny, the young wife. The '
i "character" parts of minor figures
are caricatures, but excellent ones."
There are pictures of nudism, Nazi I
growth, and other social and politi- j
cal movements. And towards them 5
all Hans Fallada, though antagonis- '
tic, is fair.
