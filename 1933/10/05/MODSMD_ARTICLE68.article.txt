LOS ANGELES, Oct. 5 (P.I.P.)â€”;
"Fight On," the rousing U.S.C. song,
has made friends for the Trojans all <
over the country, according to Har
old Roberts, maestro of the S.C. t
band. He tells of the thrill he got
when he heard it played in the mid
dle of the Indian Ocean last sum
mer.
The song was written eleven years
ago by Milo Sweet, then a dental
student, and Glenn O. Grant. The
song was chosen because it was
short and simple.
