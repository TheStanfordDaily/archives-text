LOS ANGELES, Oct. 5 (P. 1.1.)—
Issuing a warning to all freshmen
and first year juniors college men,
Roy Johnson, president of the Tro
jan Knights, declared yesterday that
"dinks" will be worn this year on
the Southern California campus.
Hazing on the campus has been
abolished this year in line with the
policy of the more progressive col
leges and universities throughout
the United States, he said, but the
Trojan tradition of the "wearing of
tho green" will be strictly enforced.
'"If you must drink, do it off the
campus."—Handbook.
