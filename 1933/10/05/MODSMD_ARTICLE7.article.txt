# Mister President Speaks
## 
### 
Hard-talking, hard-working F.D.R.
sent another bulletin to the coun
try last night, this one via a speech
to the Catholic Charities Conference
in New York. Aside from some good
strong cheer-leading, he gave strong
warning. "... The Federal govern
ment cannot . . . take over the whole
job (of relief) . . . Every commu
nity and every state must do its full
share."
