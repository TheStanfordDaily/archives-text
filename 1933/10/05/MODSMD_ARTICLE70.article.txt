# Drofnats Meets 'Harold'; Moans Drama Failure
## 
### 
Mr. Drofnats, well known to Stan
ford Theatre goers, turns out to be
a mere sensation seeker after all.
At the tryouts last night for the
contemplated dramatic production,
"Anns and the Man," Droffie was
to be seen, milling with the crowd,
threshing his arms wildly, vainly
seeking a chance to try out for a
part. When interviewed, late last
night at the Rest Home, Mr. Drof
nats had a lurid tale to tell.
"And I did want a part so badly,"
he croaked, half choking with sobs.
"But when I wrote my name out on
that application sheet and promised
faithfully to go to all of the re
hearsals, Mr. Helvenston just took
it and didn't say anything. Later,
though, he remarked that he was
locking for a dissipated type, and
he thought I might do."
"The thing that puzzled me,"
Drofnats added, "was why Mr. Hel
venston said that all I needed was a
brown derby hat and a cane to be a
success. I don't see why he would
want a brown derby hat and a cane
in a big production like 'Arms and
the Man,' do you?" The reporter
assured him of his sympathy, even
blinking a bit. "The thing that made
me a nervous wreck, was when the
director lost his temper. I don't see
hew such a mild looking man could
throw so many things. And when
I was reading he kept talking with
someone behind that pulpit of his
in the aisle."
"In fact," Drofnats continued, "the
only bright spot in the. evening was
Mary Anita Loos. Johnny Peckham
was there, with Jim Benet, both of
them reading as many parts as they
could lay hands on. And I noticed
Waldo Salt reading a lot, and talk
ing through his nose."
"But I'm going to watch the Daily,
and look on the bulletin in the
Green Room, and won't Mother be
prcud when I get a part."
