# GUANO ON QUAD
## 
### 
Barn swallows, apparently a spe
cies of sea gulls, are trying to make
the guano business a California
home industry over at the Little
Theatre and Germanic Languages
Department. Across the court is the
Zoology Department where mud
nest scars show that the habitat and
habits of the birds are known there.
