THORNHILL'S BOYS
SCRIMMAGE FOR KEEPS
"If you asked me," declared the
Alert Young Sports Fan, "to name
the outstanding difference between
the Stanford Warner-coached teams
of the past decade, and the Stanford
Thornhill-coached team of the past
fortnight, I'd put it down as spirit.
"Spirit is the high-light of the
Thornhill regime. Spirit on the
field and off the field; spirit in
game and spirit in practice.
"Those boys are always on the
peck and looking for trouble. The
other night Thornhill called for goal
line scrimmage—trying to work the
team out of its scoring hesitation
when in the vicinity of that familial
place. The boys ripped, smacked,
banged, tore, and heaved themselves
around that bit of turf until it began
to look like the battle of Gettysburg
played in stomp time with 1933 cuss
woi d.s. They took Grayson out of
Ihore crumpled up but still together;
they took Sim out in time to save
him. They were playing that scrim
mage for keeps."
NEW SHIFT
IS WARNER STUFF
"And what other differences do
you note between the two coaches'
i ystems?" we asked the Alert Young
Sports Fan. •
"There is not a great deal of
difference in the mechanics of
play. Tliis new shift which you
see the hoys doing (and it's a
very neat shift indeed, methinks)
was really developed by Warner
and his associates last winter.
Warner is using it himself at
Temple, where he won his first
game against South Carolina very
handily, stressing the | double
spinners that were first used at
Stanford last year.
'"Thornhill has discarded that
double spinner— retreating quarter
back stuff, although he is retaining
Warner's new shift. In the first game
against San Jose the quarter-back
did quite a bit of ambling around
in the back-field before the play
started, but that proved to be too
slow, and I noticed in the last game
that it has been discarded."
OLD CARLISLE
FORMATION?
"One big thing you'll notice is that
when the team comes out of the
shift, they may shift to the right or
they may shift to the left; they may
g > into the familiar double wing
back formation, usually styled the
"A" formation, or they may go into
an unfamiliar position which will
probably look very cock-eyed at
first. It is usually called "C" for
mation, although soma people call
it tandem formation, or single wing
back formation. I eve\n heard one
man say it was the old Carlisle for
mation, although that is something
I know nought about.
It is very effective for power
housing the opposition, and it in
cludes spreading (he ends about
two feet or so from the tackles,
after the manner of the Notre
Dame line, although said line re
mains unbalanced, as customary
in the Warner system. It has
possibilities, and although as >et
the quarter-backs have called
nothing but simple stuff from it,
I can hardly wait until the S.C.
game when some fast guy like
Johnny Reisner or Boh Hamilton
comes off that lead half position
on a reverse and goes through a
broken field to the first touch
down Stanford has scored on
those stiffs in three years."
