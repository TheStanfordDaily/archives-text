# Punting Is Stressed For Bronc Contest
## ALUSTIZA OPPOSES PAGLIA IN KICKING BATTLE SATURDAY 
### Spud Hamilton 
With the date of the widely her
alded punting duel between Mr. Joe
Paglia of Santa Clara and, "in the
other cornuh," Mr. Frank Alustiza
, '>f Stanford, attaining uncomfortable
Coach Thornhill of the
Cards is stressing the kicking game.
In last night's practice the short
and dark Stanford fullback engaged
in a little punting duel on the home
grounds with his teammate Bob
Maentz. Maentz got away some good
boots on his own part, and returned
Alustiza's efforts for good gains ftom
safety.
Three Fullbacks
Thornhill will have three capable
fullbacks on tap to shoot at the mul
tiple spinning Broncos. Playing in
first string position all this week has
been Bobby Grayson, who appeared
to have the greatest punch in the
U.C.L.A. game. Then there is Hill
man, (he veteran who has been pass
ing, punting, and carrying the ball
now for two full seasons, and who
has escaped the pleasures or pangs
of fulsome publicity during hia
years of service.
Number three man is the fore
mentioned Alustiza, as cool and ca
pable a triple-threat man as ever
stepped on a field. His compact 196
pounds coupled with speed that be
lies his size gives Alustiza punch in
line smashes. His passes are flat and
bullet like, and his punting is the
best on the Stanford squad since the
days of Harlow Rothert.
Who Will Start ,
Saturday, Thornhill will have a
difficult choice between the three
men. His strategy may be to start
Alustiza if the Broncos kick off to
Stanford; Hamilton if the Cards kick
off to their opponents; Hillman if
experience and defensive strength is
deemed essential.
For the rest, it appears at present
that Afflerbaugh, Maentz, and Sim
will complete the backfield, with the
same line that opened against U.C.
L.A. Callaway and Palamountain at
tackles, Corbus and O'Connor at
guards, Bates at center, and Nor
gard and Moscrip, ends.
