# Polo Outlook Optimistic As Lettermen Return
## 
### 
With more than thirty exepri
enced mallet-wielders reporting for
initial practice sessions, Captain
Richard Gordan, Stanford's veteran
polo coach, is looking forward to one
of the most successful seasons that
his rapidly improving teams have
exeprienced.
Supplying three-fourths of a po
tential starting lineup will be a trio
of returning lettermen that includes
Luppe Lupen, PCetnp Maer, and
Woody Melone. Luppen, who, if he
continues to improve, is expected to
be one of the most brilliant polo
players that Stanford has produced,
and Melone, a steady, experienced
player, were both members of last
year's first-string quartet.
