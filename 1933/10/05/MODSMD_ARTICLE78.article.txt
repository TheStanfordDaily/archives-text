# Stanfordites Like To Pose For Photosâ€”Geo. Waters
## 
### 
Stanford undergraduates like to
have their pictures taken but they
hate to admit it, in the opinion of
George Waters, stafT photographer
for the 1933 Quad and who is now
working on the 1934 yearbook.
"Some people protest posing for
the photographer, but it is usually
because they are inconvenienced,
not because they are not flattered,"
he commented.
Sports shots are most difficult to
get, according to Waters, because
the unexpected happens in a mo
ment and is hpotographed within
the fraction of a second or not at
all. Especially is that true in foot
ball, where a huge area of the pho
tographic field is covered in a few
seconds by a plunging quarterback.
Three of Waters' photographs la
ken for the 1933 Quad were re
printed in "University," a maga
zine very similar to the "College
Humor" of several years ago.
