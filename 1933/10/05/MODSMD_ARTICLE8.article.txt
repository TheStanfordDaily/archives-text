## Varsity Captains To Umpire Annual Dirtfest At 3 O'clock Today 
### 
Freshman and sophomore teams
will take the "back to the Farm"
motto literally today a.s the lower
classmen clash in the annual mud
fight at 3 o'clock on the frosh foot
ball field.
An uproariously confident frosh
class last night gathered in the
Encina lobby and named Bob
Harris as murifight captain and
hurled defiant threats against its
opposition. At approximately the
same time Hunt Kingsberry was
named to captain the sophs.
Five judges were named last night
to officiate at the clash. They are:
Chuck Otis, tennis captain, Hal Ed
elen, basketball captain, Dick Miles,
baseball captain, Gus Meier, track
captain, and Jerry Trautman, A.S.
S.U. president.
Waiting for the starting gun last
night the first freshmen to enter un
der President Wilbur's renaissance
were not reluctant to claim an easy
and overwhelming victory as nearly
the entire class pledged themselves
to do battle this afternoon.
Freshman battlers will gather in
front of Encina Hall at 2:30 -o'clock
where they will get final instruc
tions. The Rally Committee will be
gin to whip the second year men
into shape at 2:15 o'clock behind
Branner Hall and endeavor to pre
vent any premature clashes.
Rally Committee, identifiable by
the red cap, will be in general
charge of the affair and conti'ol the
crowd of students and cameramen.
The $80 expense incurred by the
lower class warriors, which will
cover the cost of defrayed turf, will
be paid by the A.S.S.U.
