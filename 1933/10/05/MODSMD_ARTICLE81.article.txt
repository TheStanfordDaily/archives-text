POLO GROUNDS, Now York,
Oct. 4 (/I 3 ). —Playing like a team
that is just beginning to realize its
own strength and enjoy it thor
oughly, the rampant New York;
Giants swarmed over the Washing
ton Senators today with swash
buckling confidence, routed the vet- j
eran Alvin (General) Crowder with
one concentrated outburst of bat- j
ling; power and scored their second
straight world series victory, 6 to 1.
For the second straight day the
"hitlers wonders," who knocked all
the advanced dope into a cocked hat
by romping off with the National
League pennant, continued to punch
the Washington pitching staff groggy
and conduct a surging drive for the
\v< rid championship.
They knocked Crowder, ace right
hander of the Senators, from the
box with a six-run outburst in the
sixth inning, a spectacular baiting
revival that aroused a crowd of 35,-
461 cash customers to delirious en- '
ihusiasm.
The celebrated "man in the green
suit," Frank (Lefty) O'Doul, made
his first appearance of the series, as
a pinch hitter, and delivered a hard
single to the center with* the bases
full, while the crowd gave an ova
tion to the former National League
batting king. These were the first j
of two runs of the big sixth inning, j
furnishing what proved to be the I
deciding margin, but sturdy Gus j
mancuso, the Giants' backstop,
capped the climax of the rally by ,
pulling the ancient "squeeze play,"
bringing O'Doul across the plate and
catching the entire Senator infield
fiatfooted.
