# Rooters' Caps Required For Santa Clara Game
## 
### 
All Stanford rooters, especially
new students, were warned last
night that official red and white j
rooters' hats are to be worn in the |
rooting section for the Santa Clara 1
game here Saturday.
They may be purchased at Wide
man's in Palo Alto at sixty-five
cents, a thirty-five cent drop from I
last year's price.
Why do women persist in braving I
the stares of iraie law students on j
their steps? j
