# SOCCER OUTLOOK GOOD AS 60 MEN START WORKOUTS
## 
### 
Sixty enthusiastic soccermen, 40
varsity and 20 frosh, turned out yes
terday under the leadership of
Coach Harry Maloney to issue a
warning against any aspiring "kick
and run" outfits in the vicinity of
Stanford University. After listening
to a pep talk by Coach Maloney the
varsity players voted to defray the
expenses of visiting teams in order
to increase the number of league
games to six in addition to the Cali
fornia contest.
Under the old system Stanford
played two games with each league
school, one on the home field and
one at the opponents' campus; how
ever, because of decreasing expense
accounts, the Farm team was only
given expense money for one off
campus trip, that being to the Cali- |
fornia game. Rather than play only
one game with each school, the In
dian soccer team voted to pay the
expenses of the visiting squads, as
suring two games with each league
opponent on the home field. Two of
the Cal-Stanford games will be on
the campus with the final game tak- 1
ing place on the morning of the Big j
Game.
The varsity squad should be strong I
this season with plenty of experi
enced material. The only regulars
that have not shown up for practice,
are Nifty Branch and Kelley Steele.
Steele may report later but Branch
is not in school this quarter.
A promising frosh team that looks
better than the usual first year turn
out should go places under the di
rection of Bob Moore, new yearling
coach who replaces Bus Holmes.
Moore is a former Indian all-con
i ference center half and will play on
, the varsity as well as coach the I
! frosh.
