# Students Anxious To Understand "New Deal"
## 
### 
Increasing interest in Political
Science and Economics as indicated
by record enrollments in certain
courses in these departments may
bear some relation to the increasing
interest of students in national af
fairs since the inauguration of
Franklin D. Roosevelt's "New Deal."
This conclusion and others of a
i similar nature was made plausible
when students were turned out of
the Economics 55 classroom and the
course in American National Gov
ernment apeked 200 students into a
room designed to hold 100.
