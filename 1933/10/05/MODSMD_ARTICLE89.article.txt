# Laborde Wins On Continent
## 
### 
Although he had to pay his own
passage in order to compete for the
American A.A.U., Henri Laborde, ■
Indian weight sensation, had the
satisfaction of repeatedly triumph- ,
ing over some of the best American
and European discus tossers during j
the summer months on a barnstorm
ing tour across the Atlantic.
The Stanford behemoth was the
only West Coast track and field
athlete who made the European trip.
Laborde scored nine first places in
trie shot and discus events; he com
peted in ten different meets with
the A.A.U. These meets were held
in Sweden, Germany, Hungary, and
France.
Vic(or in N.C.A.A.
"Here" started the summer with
a discus victory at Chicago in the
National Collegiate Athletic Asso
ciation meet on June 17. His win
ning toss was 163 feet 3 : :4 inches. 1
Laborde also placed fifth in the shot
at this meet.
At the A.A.U. event early in July,
the Cardinal competitor secured only
a third place—thus, was not un
conditionally qualified to make the
trip to foreign ports. By paying his 1
own way, he secured special per- i
mission to enter the further sched
uled competition.
Four Firsts in Sweden
In international meetings at vari- i
ous Swedish towns, Laborde scored
four first places. In Stockholm, he
heaved the platter close to 159 feet.
He also placed third in an exhibi
tion discus throw, and seventh in
his secondary event, the shot put.
It required a slight toss of less ;
than 150 feet for Laborde to capture
five points at Sundsvall soon after
the Stockholm appearance. How
ever, the Stanford man had a bad
day and failed to place in an inter
national gathering at Vasteras, Swe
den.
Traveling to Malmo, also in the |
Scandinavian country, Laborde de- I
felted a group of Swedish and Da
nish athletes, not to mention his
teammates, to take the discus with
a 160 foot 9 9-16 inch toss and the
shot at 46 feet 2 2-3 inches.
Here Beats 165 Feet
In Dusseldorf, Germany, the In
dian athlete made the best throw
of his European career—l6s feet
3.67 inches.
He followed this conquest with j
two other first places in the discus
at Hamburg and Hanover. Both (
throws hovered around 159 feet. He ;
scored third in the shot put at each
of these two meets. A throw of j
-lightly better than 154 feet secured
a victory in Berlin.
