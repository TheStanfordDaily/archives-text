# BRADSHAW TRAINS BABE ELEVEN FOR TROJAN CONTEST
## 
### 
With rumors floating up from
the South concerning the strength
of the freshman unit of S.C.'s fa
mous football organization, Coach
Jimmy Bradshaw has begun the
serious task of whipping his year
lings into fighting strength for the
Trojan ordeal a week from Satur
day.
Sifting and sorting a heterogene
ous collection of prop school stars, a
job that faces any freshman coach,
is si ill being carried on by Brad
shaw and his two assistants, John
Burin and Don Robesky, despite ihe
fact that the Indian Babes have al
ready survived two tough early sea
son games.
Team Uneven
A lack of players at some positions
and an overabundance at others has
made a good deal of shifting about
necessary. Melvin Hurley, originally
a tackle, has been switched to guard
where his 210 pounds go far toward
strengthening one of the team's
weak points. Jack Walton, a big
newcomer from San Francisco, fills
the other guard spot and will con
tinue to in spite of a face injury last
night that required six stitches to
repair.
Still working on their compara
tively ineffective offense, the fresh
men spent last night's sessibn run
ning through a number of scoring
plays that may or may not befuddle
the Terrible Trobabes next week.
Rusty Lcdbetter, 190-pound full
back from Placentia, lived up to his
early season reputation with a se
ries of smashes at the line which
usually ended up somewhere far
along in the second string's terri
tory, with several defensive backs
clinging to his powerful frame.
Carl Schott, probably Bradshaw's
outstanding end, was at practice last
night after having been laid up for
some time with a broken toe. Schott
will pair oil with Walter Schouteau
at the wing positions in Saturday's
game against Armstrong Business
College.
These two flankmen, plus Hurley
and Walton at guards, Bergman at
center, and Tsoutsouvas and Beedle
at tackles, will complete a line that
stacks up with any the freshmen are
likely to meet, as far as weight is
concerned. A lack of heavy re
serves, however, may prove a seri
ous weakness. At guards, for in
stance, Bradshaw has no more men
to approach the weight of the beefy
first-stringers.
Backs Light
Outside of Ledbettor, the year
lings' backfield will have to depend
on speed rather than brawn as its
