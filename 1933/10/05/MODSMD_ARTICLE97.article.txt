# FOOTBALL ELEVENS THROUGHOUT COUNTRY WARM UP FOR MAJOR SATURDAY CLASHES
## 
### Roger Kimball 
With the 1933 season getting well |
under way, several key games this ,
Saturday will be played in all sec
tions of the country. Conference |
schedules are reaching the point
where competition is stiff, and the |
teams surviving the coming week
end should have good chances at
section titles in many cases. Few
of the big teams have set-ups to
look forward to.
One of the most important games
of the week-end will be played at
Athens, Georgia, between Tulane
and Georgia. Tulane won this clas
sic last year by the unusual score
of 35 to 24. Although the touch
downs will probably not be so plen- j
tiful Saturday, it will be a surprise
if either of these great teams wins
by more than a narrow margin. The
game is practically a toss-up, with
any edge that exists going to the
Georgians, who have their strong
est team in years.
Alabama-Mississippi
Dixie will see another great
struggle when Alabama and Mis- 1
sissippi meet at Birmingham. Al
though the former eleven is more |
famous, the Mississippians held
them to a close 24 to 13 verdict in
1932, and are a distinct threat to
the present Crimson Tide outfit, ,
which lacks Cain and other stars of
last year. Fassing is expected to
feature this clash. The University
of Tennessee, one of the outstand- \
ing teams of the South last season,
faces a relatively easy rival in Mis
sissippi State, subdued by the Vol
unieers by a 31 to 0 margin in their
most recent meeting.
A great game, however, .should
lake place between Villanova and
South Carolina at. Columbia. Last j
year, the state university team won
by the closest of scores, 7 to 6. Ken- ,
ti'cky and Georgia Tech play in
another outstanding struggle. The
1932 game was won by Kentucky,
12 to 6, but the Engineers are |
slightly favored in this game, as |
they have been on the upward trail t
recently, returning to their great
ness of four or five years ago.
Wisconsin-Marquette
The best of several first-class
games in the Middle West take place
at Madison, Wisconsin, where the
Badgers meet the strong Marquette \
team. Seven to two was the score :

in favor of Wisconsin in 1932; the
game may well be even closer this
ytar, as the small Illinois college
made famous by Ralph Metcalfe has
sti ength-proving victories 1o its
credit. Purdue plays Ohio Univer
sity in Lafayette, the former's home
tewn. The Boilermakers, co-favor
ites with Michigan for the Big Ten
crown, are favored to win handily.
The annual Michigan-Michigan
State fracas takes place Saturday
at Ann Arbor with Harry Kipke's
great Wolverines expected to con
quer the Staters by a healthy mar
gin. Minnesota and Indiana should
stage one of the Big Ten's closest
struggles, although the result will
prtbably have small bearing on the
outcome of the Western Conference
race. Ohio State takes on a tough
foe in Virginia at Columbus, in one
of the few outstanding intersectional
clashes.

The annual Michigan-Michigan
State fracas takes place Saturday
at Ann Arbor with Harry Kipke's
great Wolverines expected to con
quer the Staters by a healthy mar
gin. Minnesota and Indiana should
stage one of the Big Ten's closest
struggles, although the result will
prtbably have small bearing on the
outcome of the Western Conference
race. Ohio State takes on a tough
foe in Virginia at Columbus, in one
of the few outstanding intersectional
clashes.
With the 1933 season getting well |
under way, several key games this ,
Saturday will be played in all sec
tions of the country. Conference |
schedules are reaching the point
where competition is stiff, and the |
teams surviving the coming week
end should have good chances at
section titles in many cases. Few
of the big teams have set-ups to
look forward to.
One of the most important games
of the week-end will be played at
Athens, Georgia, between Tulane
and Georgia. Tulane won this clas
sic last year by the unusual score
of 35 to 24. Although the touch
downs will probably not be so plen- j
tiful Saturday, it will be a surprise
if either of these great teams wins
by more than a narrow margin. The
game is practically a toss-up, with
any edge that exists going to the
Georgians, who have their strong
est team in years.
Alabama-Mississippi
Dixie will see another great
struggle when Alabama and Mis- 1
sissippi meet at Birmingham. Al
though the former eleven is more |
famous, the Mississippians held
them to a close 24 to 13 verdict in
1932, and are a distinct threat to
the present Crimson Tide outfit, ,
which lacks Cain and other stars of
last year. Fassing is expected to
feature this clash. The University
of Tennessee, one of the outstand- \
ing teams of the South last season,
faces a relatively easy rival in Mis
sissippi State, subdued by the Vol
unieers by a 31 to 0 margin in their
most recent meeting.
A great game, however, .should
lake place between Villanova and
South Carolina at. Columbia. Last j
year, the state university team won
by the closest of scores, 7 to 6. Ken- ,
ti'cky and Georgia Tech play in
another outstanding struggle. The
1932 game was won by Kentucky,
12 to 6, but the Engineers are |
slightly favored in this game, as |
they have been on the upward trail t
recently, returning to their great
ness of four or five years ago.
Wisconsin-Marquette
The best of several first-class
games in the Middle West take place
at Madison, Wisconsin, where the
Badgers meet the strong Marquette \
team. Seven to two was the score :

in favor of Wisconsin in 1932; the
game may well be even closer this
ytar, as the small Illinois college
made famous by Ralph Metcalfe has
sti ength-proving victories 1o its
credit. Purdue plays Ohio Univer
sity in Lafayette, the former's home
tewn. The Boilermakers, co-favor
ites with Michigan for the Big Ten
crown, are favored to win handily.
