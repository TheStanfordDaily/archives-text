# National Education Assoc. Publishes Finance Report
## 
### 
Experts are maintaining that
whereas the depression struck busi
ness several years ago, its worst
effects are only now being felt by
educational institutions.
Realizing the seriousness of this
matter, the National Education As
sociation this summer published an
extensive report on the financing of
education. Both rural and metropo
litan schools of all grades were cov
eied in the report which not only
treated the matter from the scien
tific viewpoint of what was ideal
iiUically best for education but how
these aims could be realized po
litically.
