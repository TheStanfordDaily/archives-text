"WHEN A FELLER
NEEDS A FRIEND"
... call on good old Briggs!
Remember how those lovable Briggs car
toons used to smile away your cares and
worries? Now there's tTic same kind of
genial sunshine and comfort for you . • •
in BRIGGS Pipe Mixture.
Named in honor of Clare Briggs, this new
pipe tobacco is as kindly and gentle as its
namesake! Mellowed in the wood for
years ... there's not a bite in a barrel of it!
You've paid twice as much for tobacco
not nearly so good. But BRIGGS would
much rather talk in your pipe than in print.
Try a tin . . . and let it speak for itself!
BRIGGS Pipe Mixture is nlso sold in 1-pound nnd
Ji-pound tins. . . and in 1-pound Humidor kegs.
