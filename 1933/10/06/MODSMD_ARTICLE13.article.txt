## 
### 
At a meeting in the Concert Seties
offices last night, manager Prentice
Messimer outlined to prospective
tryoutees details of the work they
would be supposed to do which
would consist of both office work
and selling tickets.
At present a campaign is planned
to bring the Concert Series before
the students in which the tryoutees
will help. Messimer feels that too
many students think they have to
"dress up" to go to a concert and
hence go to a show instead. He
plans to stress the fact that this is
not necessary, and also that the con
certs are not supposed to be educa
tional but are supposed to furnish
pleasure and amusement.
