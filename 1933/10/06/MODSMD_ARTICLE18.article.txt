# Temperature Yesterday Tops Heat Record Here
## 
### 
While the underclassmen play
fully pushed each other in the con]
but muddy waters of the frosh
field yesterday, the rest of the cam
pus sizzled and moaned as the cur
rent heat; wave reached its peak at
2:30 in the afternoon.
With the mercury up to the un- '
familiar height of a new rec
ord for 1933 was set. Not. only was !
yesterday the hottest day of the
year but the hottest October day
on record here, according to the
Physics Department. Indications are
that tans will be darkened much
this month, after a long and cool
summer on the farm. Sighs are
heard from all directions, as &azcs
turn toward Lagunitaâ€”with its bot
tom dry and rocky.
