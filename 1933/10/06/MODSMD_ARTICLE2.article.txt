After lurking under cover for
over a month, labor violence reared
its ugly head once again yesterday.
In strike-ridden Pennsylvania, two
hundred pate - thwacking' deputies
attacked and dispersed strikers
doing NKA "peaceful picketing."
Clouds of that nasty stufT, tear gas,
plus a few well-aimed shots, did the
work. Result: one dead miner; fif
teen others bruised and torn. Both
sides now look to see what _ labor
sympathizing Governor Pinchot and
his picketing Mrs. will do.
Meanwhile, scenes reminiscent of
the war took place in Illinois'
"Bloody Williamson" County: 1,500
anti - Lewis union and anti - NRA
sympathizers blazed away at a work
bound miners' column, but vanished
when National Guard companies
double-timed to the scene of the
all-night battle.
