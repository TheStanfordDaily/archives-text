# Peckham Wins Role In Shaw Russian Play
## Albertson, Salt, Fuller Also Cast; More Later 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
Continuing the intensive compe
tition for parts in Harold Helven
ston's production of G.T3.S.'.s "Arms
and the Man," almost a hundred
players attended the tryouts yester
day afternoon.
Chief among the four players
c.v: f was John Peckham, who will
appear as Major Sergius Saranoff,
one of the most interesting charac
ters in the piece, a composite prod
uct of Byronism and militarism.
Peckham is remembered for his
stellar work in last winter's "Holi
day." of which his Ned Seton was
oi.r of the highlights.
An outstanding feature of the
tryout, period was the work of Jean
Albertson, to whom has been al
lotted the only feminine role thus
far assigned—-that of Louka, the de
fiant servant girl—a departure from
the usual stage domestic. A sopho
more, Miss Albertson is not without
Stanford experience, having ap
peared in two Sword and Sandals
readings last spring, "An Ideal Hus
band" and "Major Barbara's Wed
i ding." ,
I Waldo Salt, he of the infallible
I kr-.'ick of stealing the show, has been
provided with an opportunity akin
to that of which be made so much
in (he recent "Hawk Island." He
will play Nicola, the middle-aged
man servant.
The Prussian officer in the play
will be played by George Fuller,
| who is new to the Stanford stage,
but who promises much in the way
of comedy.
