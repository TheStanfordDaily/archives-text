# WILBUR TELLS NEW STUDENTS TO LEARN JOB
## Assembly Hall Is Crowded As President Flays Lazy Scholars 
### 
A president of Stanford Univer
sity, a Secretary of the Interior in
the cabinet of the Farm's most fa
mous alumnus, presented to an
overcrowded Assembly Hall yester
i day his ideas of conduct "befitting
j a Stanford gentleman" or lady.
In his heavy, yet subdued voice,
| which caused back seat listeners
to lean forward in their seats,
President Kay Lyman Wilbur :Â»<!-
j vised his charges to "Learn your
j job," advised against relying f)ii
I family acres and bulging piles of
j bonds for economic security, fie
; indicated the fleeting nature of
j such possessions, told depression
; conscious University students to
j carry their security in their heads.
Stanford tradition, the honor code,
the Stanfords' antipathy to cigar
ettes on the Inner Quad, came in
for their .share of attention. Care
ful was Stanford's Wilbur to see
that Senator Stanford and not the
18th amendment got credit for local
bans on liquor. Urged he: "Caroline
J and alcohol do not mix," and two
balcony co-eds left the hall. The
president's declaration against hur
ried driving recalled to the campus
last season's automobile-pedestrian
tragedy.
Numbers squirmed in their seats
as with pointed finger and lowered
I voice, Wilbur struck out at the "get
j by" boys, said that such provided
most of the "college failures."
Before the towering Wilbur had
I unfolded spectacles and prepared
I speech, he introduced to the audi
j ence Dean Mary Yost and Dean
I George Culver, to whom he affec
[ tionately referred as "George."
Dean Yost made an especial plea
J for an equal place for Stanford
j women in Stanford activities. She
j wanted no favoritism, and no dis
crimination for her newly acquired
"800."
Dean George Culver was par
ticularly careful to "identify"
J himself as an individual separate
j and apart from similarly grey
! beaded and grey suited Alumni
Secretary, Ezra McDowell. Said
he: "Look at my lapel; if i do not
; wear a beautiful flower, I am not
j the Alumni Secretary." To the
huge body of roughs assembled
he declared: "If you have any
j trouble, at any time, come to the
i Dean of Mcu's Office."
