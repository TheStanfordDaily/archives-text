# Finances Of School Stay Same-Erwin
## Decreased Income Barely Offset By Tuition 
### 
Despite the abolishment of the
j"500" and the subsequent increased
.enrollment at Stanford, the school's
| financial situation is little improved
| this year.
According to Ernest Stephen
Krvvin, Assistant Comptroller, the
additional tuition thus derived has
done little more than substitute
for decreased income from the
school's investments, which arc
producing even less than prcvi
i ously.
Students, too, are still feeling the
depression, as the number of tuition
rotes issued this year nearly equals
i that of last. Fewer undergraduate
| students have applied for them,
j however, though it is still too early
for accurate statistics to be com
piled.
No record has been kept of de-
I ferred payments.
