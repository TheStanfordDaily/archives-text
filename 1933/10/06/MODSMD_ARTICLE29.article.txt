# Polo Budget Is Eliminated
## 
### 
With 46 men turning out for polo
this quarter, the polo team will have
to get along without the usual $300
a year formerly given to it by the
Board of Athletic Control.
This announcement was made
yesterday hy polo coach Richard A.
Gordan. Captain Gordan revealed
his disappointment in the B.AG. for
S its action with the statement, "If
! there is any sport in the University
; that, needs financial assistance it is
j polo. Stanford should be proud of
a sport that has shown such success
j in the past."
With the* unexpectedly large turn-
J out, however, he intends to build up
! a good team despite the cut, al
! though only .*3O of the 46 can be re-
Itained.
This year's team will be built
I around Woody Molonc, Luppe Lu
j pen, and Kemp Maer, who arc the
j only returning letter men. Others
i who are expected to contribute to
i the success of this year's team are
j Will Rogers and Bill Enemark.
