Continuing its policy of "America
for Americans," the l'un-loving Le
gionnaires yesterday passed a whole
series of resolutions aimed at pro
tecting the U.S. from evil foreign
influences. Their manifesto called
for deportation of alien Commu
nists, refusal of entry of Commu
nists into the U.S., laws providing
for the punishment of all persons
who advocate the overthrow of the
government, reduction of the immi
grant quota by 90 per cent, and
declared against diplomatic recog
nition of Soviet Russia, and against
extending credit to the now finan
cially solvent Russian Government.
Also, turning its-other cheek, they
resolved to oppose vigorously "the
action and teachings of all Radical
pacifist societies, clergymen, college
and school professors who advise
and urge the youth of our country
to refuse to serve our country in
time of war."
