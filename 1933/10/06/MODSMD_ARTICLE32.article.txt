# Branco's Ready For Hard Scrap Against Indians
## Stanford Counts On Strong Defense To Block Santa Clara Multiple Spinning Attack; Bronco Offense Centers Around Paglia 
### BY SPUD HAMILTON 
i SIADIUM will be the football center of the coast tomorrow
j when Coach ThornhiU's squad meets the rampant Broncos from Santa
; Mara. This game means naught as far as Coast Conference is concerned,
:»u( locally it has achieved a traditional interest that will be at a high pitch
tomorrow.
Santa Clara, by virtue of its uprooting of the U.S. Bear, is recognized as
• plenty fancy team, with speed around the ends, punch and deception in

▼the middle, deadly passing, and
I above till the great. "Diamond Joe,"
to whom booting the ball out at th«
i corners is eu.sy like shooting (i.sh.
Clipper Smith with all his lon
! monikercd offensive threats will be
tying into an alert and fast Stanford
i crew that has already established
itself as being smart defensively.
Moreover, they possess a punting
game that will match the vaunted
, Pf-glia, plus an offense of its own
j that is apt to spring into high gear
j at any odd moment.
For these reasons, grid iuter-
I est. by reason of sentiment, tradi
! tion, and a large flock of Califor
nia graduates, always focused in
the annual Gael-Bear clash, is
Subtlely shifting to Palo Alto and
environs.
Offhand, Saturday's battle looks
like a battle of specialized offense
! thrown against specialized defense,
j Santa Clara banks on those famous
! elevator passes, thrown by Sobrero
' and Judnich, with which they tamed
j the Golden Bear a full year ago.
j Conversely, Stanford counts on
'their defense just such passes, tired
| and proven in the U.C.L.A. game of
j last week. In that contest, not one
; Bruin pass was completed, and yet
the Bruins were proud of that pass
ing game of theirs, led by the passing
! fool, Frankovich.
Santa Clara counts heavily on
their electric speed on those sweep
ing runs around the flanks with
which they nailed the Bears down
this year after Paglia's coffin cor
ner kicking had broken the backs
! of the Berkeley aggregation.
Stanford thinks a lot of their
. j ends, the brilliant sophomore,
1 Moscrip, and his running mate,
Norgard. Stanford thinks these
gentlemen can smear those Bronco
sprint men, Sobrero and Kallski.
Stanford thinks they can nullify
| the efforts of the husky "Salt>''
Salatino, one of tlie best of re
i cent blocking hacks.
Santa Clara counts on then mul
tiple spinning attack developed by
j the school of Notre Dame coaches,
1 and installed by Clipper Smith, its
| greatest exponent, last year. Stan
j ford counts on a fast charging for
i ward wall that came to notice in the
i U.C.L.A. game. Stanford believe*
, this line will out-charge the Bronco
! line, slip through that lighter,
j scrappy Mission seven and smear
! those involved and ornamental plays.
Stanford counts on its line to stop
Paglia's kicking, but more than that
J they count on a few backfield men.
; Johnny Reisncr and Bob Macntz, if
they can get a little protection from
: the Bronco first wave of tacklers,
can get away for good punt returns
on those times when Paglia lets them
get hold of one of his efforts. More
than Johnny Reisncr and Maentz,
Stanford depends on Frank Alustiza,
a superlative kicker in his own
right. The Basque can boot 'em on
' a line, with plenty of distance, and
the quicker lie is forced to kick,
the farther goes the ball.
These are Stanford's defenses;
balanced against the specialized
Bronco offense, the Indians hope for
an even break at least. Nothing has
been said of Stanford's offensive
threats. They have speed; they nave
smashing power; they have decep
tion. What. Warner offense hasn't
| when it has the men?

Offhand, Saturday's battle looks
like a battle of specialized offense
! thrown against specialized defense,
j Santa Clara banks on those famous
! elevator passes, thrown by Sobrero
' and Judnich, with which they tamed
j the Golden Bear a full year ago.
j Conversely, Stanford counts on
'their defense just such passes, tired
| and proven in the U.C.L.A. game of
j last week. In that contest, not one
; Bruin pass was completed, and yet
the Bruins were proud of that pass
ing game of theirs, led by the passing
! fool, Frankovich.
Santa Clara counts heavily on
their electric speed on those sweep
ing runs around the flanks with
which they nailed the Bears down
this year after Paglia's coffin cor
ner kicking had broken the backs
! of the Berkeley aggregation.
Stanford thinks a lot of their
. j ends, the brilliant sophomore,
1 Moscrip, and his running mate,
Norgard. Stanford thinks these
gentlemen can smear those Bronco
sprint men, Sobrero and Kallski.
Stanford thinks they can nullify
| the efforts of the husky "Salt>''
Salatino, one of tlie best of re
i cent blocking hacks.
Santa Clara counts on then mul
tiple spinning attack developed by
j the school of Notre Dame coaches,
1 and installed by Clipper Smith, its
| greatest exponent, last year. Stan
j ford counts on a fast charging for
i ward wall that came to notice in the
i U.C.L.A. game. Stanford believe*
, this line will out-charge the Bronco
! line, slip through that lighter,
j scrappy Mission seven and smear
! those involved and ornamental plays.
Stanford counts on its line to stop
Paglia's kicking, but more than that
J they count on a few backfield men.
; Johnny Reisncr and Bob Macntz, if
they can get a little protection from
: the Bronco first wave of tacklers,
can get away for good punt returns
on those times when Paglia lets them
get hold of one of his efforts. More
than Johnny Reisncr and Maentz,
Stanford depends on Frank Alustiza,
a superlative kicker in his own
right. The Basque can boot 'em on
' a line, with plenty of distance, and
the quicker lie is forced to kick,
the farther goes the ball.
These are Stanford's defenses;
balanced against the specialized
Bronco offense, the Indians hope for
an even break at least. Nothing has
been said of Stanford's offensive
threats. They have speed; they nave
smashing power; they have decep
tion. What. Warner offense hasn't
| when it has the men?
i SIADIUM will be the football center of the coast tomorrow
j when Coach ThornhiU's squad meets the rampant Broncos from Santa
; Mara. This game means naught as far as Coast Conference is concerned,
:»u( locally it has achieved a traditional interest that will be at a high pitch
tomorrow.
Santa Clara, by virtue of its uprooting of the U.S. Bear, is recognized as
• plenty fancy team, with speed around the ends, punch and deception in
