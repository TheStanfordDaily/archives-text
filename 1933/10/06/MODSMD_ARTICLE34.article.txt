# The 						Leaders of Tomorrow? Blah!
## 
### 
As old as baloney is the statement: "College trains the
leaders of the future." Every commencement orator flat
lers the graduates with such stuff. And people believe,
because they believe most things that are told them.
In a vague sort of way, we all realize the need of lead
ers. And I hey must come from somewhere. So we assume
that tliev must come from college, for there people are
trained. There, they learn political science and, after all,
leaders must know political science. The neatness of the
picture should not beguile us.
Hul to what purpose will these collegians put Iheir
knowledge that lliey may accumulate? The very unscien
tific survey in yesterday's Daily shows lhal llie class of '.'57
(like every other class in every other university) is coining
here for personal reasons. They lack a social interest a
feeling of duly lo the group.
1! is not in criticism that we point this out. Killing
yourself for the people is not pleasant or profitable. Far
be il from our purpose to recommend that the class of ",\1
pick lip the cross and carry it onward and upward. The
attitude of Nathan lhal reforms and reformers can be
damned and Ihe politicians can have the government has
ils good points.
Hut Ihe commencement orators and the valedictorians
persist in claiming that college is turning out cross-bear
ers. In reality, this is pure hope of slickv-minded peda
gogues. The most pitiful thing is that these pedagogues
Ihink their hope is a reality.
And because the curriculum has belabored lectures and
even more belabored texts on the duties of citizens to their
country, some are somehow led into believing that a social
consciousness is being awakened. Hut our modern col
leges are turning out nothing but self-interested people
who laugh outright at the picture of anyone sweating, fight
ing, or dying for others.
