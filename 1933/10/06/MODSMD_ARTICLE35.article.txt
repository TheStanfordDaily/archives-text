# What Fun We Have in College
## 
### 
"Well, frosli, how do you like the joint? Pretty fancy,
eh? Yep, those fraternity and club guys and gals are just
about the nicest bunch of people you ever saw. Plenty
accommodating. Always right there with an invitation to
dinner or a show, and they furnish the car and won't let
you pay for the tickets. (Josh, this place is heaven.
Well, frosli, maybe it's heaven for the lirst week. We
hope it won't be hell later. You're just a gullible bunch
ot folks, like the rest of the student body was a year or
two ago. You're no different. Mavbe you've got more oil
the ball than the others had.
It' yon have got more, you'll show it by using your own
minds. Oddly enough, Stanford is an institution of learn
ing, not society, and each must do his lessons with some
degree of regularity or get "one of those things" at the end
of the quarter. You'll be bumping into plenty of time
wasters, gents and others who prefer a theatre, an eve
ning's necking, a few rounds of that "choice" liquor with
the foreign labels printed in Sail Francisco, or just an eve
ning's bulling. And the following mornings, it' you listen
to these easy-going people, you'll be looking at professors
through puffed eyes and putting a cap on splitting heads.
Such a dismal picture college. Hut it isn't really,
frosli. You're going to get a hell of a kick out of it. The
things your doing today and daily for the next four or
• i\ years are going to be the biggest and most genuine fun
you'll ever experience.
And, if you lake the advice of the Daily and a lot of
others around the campus, you'll make the most of your
time, and still participate in extra-curricular activities. Do
you like chess? .loin a chess club. Maybe it's dramatics.
Okeh. See Harold I lelvenston. Publications? the "C.liap
pie," if you're humorous; the Quad, if you're historical; the
Daii.y, it you've a loudness for work. Sports? Anything
you want.
.lust remember self-preservation is the lirst law of
Nature. Have a nice trip, frosli.

you pay for the tickets. (Josh, this place is heaven.
Well, frosli, maybe it's heaven for the lirst week. We
hope it won't be hell later. You're just a gullible bunch
ot folks, like the rest of the student body was a year or
two ago. You're no different. Mavbe you've got more oil
the ball than the others had.
It' yon have got more, you'll show it by using your own
minds. Oddly enough, Stanford is an institution of learn
ing, not society, and each must do his lessons with some
degree of regularity or get "one of those things" at the end
of the quarter. You'll be bumping into plenty of time
wasters, gents and others who prefer a theatre, an eve
ning's necking, a few rounds of that "choice" liquor with
the foreign labels printed in Sail Francisco, or just an eve
ning's bulling. And the following mornings, it' you listen
to these easy-going people, you'll be looking at professors
through puffed eyes and putting a cap on splitting heads.
Such a dismal picture college. Hut it isn't really,
frosli. You're going to get a hell of a kick out of it. The
things your doing today and daily for the next four or
• i\ years are going to be the biggest and most genuine fun
you'll ever experience.
And, if you lake the advice of the Daily and a lot of
others around the campus, you'll make the most of your
time, and still participate in extra-curricular activities. Do
you like chess? .loin a chess club. Maybe it's dramatics.
Okeh. See Harold I lelvenston. Publications? the "C.liap
pie," if you're humorous; the Quad, if you're historical; the
Daii.y, it you've a loudness for work. Sports? Anything
you want.
.lust remember self-preservation is the lirst law of
Nature. Have a nice trip, frosli.
