LOOK at these MUDFIGHT
EIIS! Do they look like COL- j
LEGE MEN? THEY DO. Do they
look like INTELLIGENT YOUNG !
MEN? They DON'T. WHY? BE- I
CAUSE intelligent young men
DON'T PLAY IN MUD. They
leave that for GAMIN. Why did
we come to COLLEGE? To raise
HELL or to LEARN the ART OF
FINE LIVING?
Is FINE ART IN PHYSICAL EX
PRESSION found in brutal, UN
; THINKING manifestation of IM
i PULSIVE, muscular activity or does
! the highly sensitive PIUMAN NER
i VGUS CENTER — the brain—have
I ANYTHING to do with a HUMAN
BEING'S physical expression?
SCIENTIFIC FOOTBALL as
thought and played is an INTELLI
GENT and BEAUTIFUL ihing. BUT
IIS THERE ANYTHING SCIEN
TIFIC OR BEAUTIFUL ABOUT A
MUDFIGHT? ITS CONCEPTION
may be intelligent in that it recog
nizes a need for "orutal low-life phy
sical OUTLET in some young men
animals.
BUT are COLLEGE MEN LOW
! LIFE? Maybe they ARE. BUT at
| STANFORD we like to give the im
nression that they are NOT. A
TRADITION like Ihe MUDFIGHT
should havv! been ABOLISHED as
fa: - back as 1806, when the EARTH
