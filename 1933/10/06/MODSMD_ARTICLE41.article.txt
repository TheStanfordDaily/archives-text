# Bronx Merry-Go-Round

### 
"Holy Joe" McKee's Farley-spon
sored Gotham mayoralty campaign
was given another boost yesterday
when pugnacious-looking Ferdinand
Pecora plopped squarely into the
important candidacy cf District At
torney 011 the independent Demo
cratic ticket. Scowling, Fiorello La-
Guardia, little Italy's white hope for
the spacious seat occupied by bum
bling, prognathous Jorn Patrick
O'Brien, Tammanyite, scowled still
more.
What with the revolt of the Bronx
against the Tiger organization, and
the Pecora-magnet for the Italian
vote, his chances looked worse; John
Patrick's better. But McKee hopes
to eat Tiger-meat in the forthcom
ing election. Pecora denies the I!oo
seveltian influence behind his can
didacy, but grins widely.
