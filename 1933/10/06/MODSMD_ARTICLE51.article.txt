# TOPIC OF STANFORD-CAL DEBATE CHANCED TO AVERT RISK OF D.A.R. BLACKLISTING
## 
### 
Blacklisting by the D.A.R., self
acclaimed patriots, may have been
narrowly averted this week by the
Stanford debating squad.
Accepted by a male Stanford
squad was the invitation of Uni
versity of California women to
discuss ''Resolved. That the D.A.11.
Should Continue to Exist." Yes
terday Berkeley forensic manag
ers phoned here that they wished
to change the topic to "Resolved,
That There Should Be -Free
Speech on University Canipi."
Informed observers were not slow
to conclude that the Daughters had
brought pressure to bear at Califor
nia, to remember that the late David
Starr Jordan, long - time Stanford

president, was blacklisted for his
vie ws on peace during the World
War. Had D.A.R. wrath fallen on
Farm orators, their names would go
on record with those of William Al
len White, Rabbi Stephen Wise, and
many others.
On safe and certain ground, de
bate adviser Lee Chapin yesterday
considered probable acceptance of
two invitations from San Jose State's
Debate Coach, Ralph G. Eckert.
The first invitation proposed
that Stanford and San Jose State
speakers debate some phase of the
Agricultural Recovery Act before
Grange Association groups in
Santa Clara county towns.
Novel in nature, the second in

vitation is for a debate to be held
out of doors on the San Jose cam
pus at noon on November 21. Sub
ject: National Recovery Act.
Considered potential good mate
rial among new turnouts for debat
! ing by Adviser Chapin are John
i Lyman, senior, Olympic shot putter;
Donald Hanson, sophomore, brother
of Quad editing and debating Ray
j Hanson, '33; Art Lundin, experi
| enced as a freshman debater.
