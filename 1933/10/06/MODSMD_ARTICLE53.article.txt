# Stanford Co-ed Caught On Liner In Hurricane
## 
### 
"Stormy Weather" was only a
popular song to Mary Jacobstein,
Stanford senior, when she went
home to Rochester, New York, last
spring. Now it reminds her of the
greatest thrill of her life, the excit
ing fight the liner Virginia waged 1
with a hurrican in the Carribean
Sea, September 20.
Returning to California to re-enter
Stanford, Mary escaped unsathed in
the storm which injured 18 passen
gers and did considerable damage
to the cargo and ship.

She praised the seamanship of
Captain George V. Richardson who
accomplished the rare feat of bring
ing his ship directly through the
ccrter of the hurrican.
The excitement began when the
Virginia ran into the storm 200 miles
south of Cuba. For an hour the iiner
battled a terrific wind which gave
the ship a list of more than 13 de
grees. This was followed by an ab
solute and deadly calm after which
the hurrican struck the ship "like
an explosion."
