## CUDDEBACK SEE ALL, TELLS NOTHING 
### 
Murray CuddSback, that dourcus
tcdian of the destinies of the Sian
lord Greys, was back on the campus
yesterday. Cuddeback is Coach
Thornhill's Chief of Staff of the
Scouting Department, and he had
just returned from Chicago where
he closely scanned the efforts of
Northwestern in their 7 to 0 loss to
lowa. Cuddeback went, gazed, scrib
bled in his book; returned, full of
dope, but not for publication.
Northwestern, with a green team,
is heavy and .slow starting, so don't
let that 7-0 score lull you into se
curity. Two weeks from now, a
Stanford team jaded by the long
train journey on top of the grueling
afternoon they are sure to see
i.gainst the Broncos Saturday, may
find it hard to win from Hanley's
charges.
