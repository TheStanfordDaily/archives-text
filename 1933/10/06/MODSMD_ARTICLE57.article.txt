# SANTA CLARA ONLY STEPPING STONE?

Now about that game with the
Brone.s. It promises to he the
stepping stone for Stanford which
they will hit with a firm tread
and go on to higher things, or on
which a slip may send them skid
ding down to the definitely Class
It division. We all thought as
much before the U.C.L.A. affair,
hill Stanford showed a great deal,
and yet did not show so much in
that contest. This time we expect
the Cards to commit themselves.
This year we hope no sports scrib
bling smart-alec busts out with the
declaration that Stanford offense is
weak because the Stanford team
has no punch through the center of
the line.
If one does we can only mutely
point to that trio of well-stacked
and beefy gentlemen, Grayson, Hill
man, and Alustiza, all of them
bulking over 190 pounds, and all of
them kicking, passing, driving. One
of these Saturday afternoons that
guy Grayson is going to get in the
loose and teach the fans what a
hard-runner looks like.
