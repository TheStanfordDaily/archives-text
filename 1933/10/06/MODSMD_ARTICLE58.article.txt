# GOLFERS COMPETE WITH FOOTBALL
## 
### 
Shunted into the background at
this moment because of the cmi- I
nence of football, local golfers are
enjoying the Northern California !
Open, played this year on the Stan- ;
ford course. Two Stanford men
h,"ve reached the quarter-finals and j
are matched with each other for j
this Saturday's play.
Jerry Trautman and "Stu" Haw- i
lej have beaten their way thus :
far through the cream of Cali- i
fornia's golfers, professional and
amateur. "Spec" Stewart, the In- i
dians' latest addition to a gallery i
<Â»f great golfers, were eliminated
by a co-medalist, Mark Fry. Ste
wart is a slender youth from the
Southwest, who in the early stages
of the tournament, rifled long
drives for amazing distances on j
the difficult course.
They never know what it is !
around U.S.C. to lack for capable
material, either on the varsity or in
immediate prospect. Last Saturday, '
the Trobabes uncovered an un
known back. Davis, who led his j
team to a 20-0 victory over L.A.J.C. j
in (he second half.
Untouted and not counted upon
ns the season started, Davis entered
the game in the second half and
.spark-plugged the team to three i
touchdowns, one of them a 65-yard
individual effort. George McNeish,
brother of the varsity passflinging
McNeish who made himself unwel
come around these parts last year,
played at center for the Troubabes.
