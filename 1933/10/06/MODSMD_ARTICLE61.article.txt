# Unknowns To Test Frosh Gridmen
## BABE BRIERS IN PRELIMINARY WITH ARMSTRONG SQUAD 
### 
Facing a team of unknown power
| whose early season's record is like
wise veiled in mystery, Stanford's
1933 freshman football outfit makes
its third public appearance tomor-
I row against Armstrong Business
College of Oakland. Played as a
' preliminary to the varsity's battle
j with Santa Clara, the game will be
j gin at 12 o'clock.
Although not expected to give
much trouble, the visitors will
have to he taken in stride in any
! case, since Coach Jimrnie Brad
| shaw is alrea'dy pointing his
charges toward next Saturday's
struggle with (he S.C. Trobabes.
Whatever the Indians run into in
tomorrow's game, they will prob
ably be amply prepared for it since
their eleven best players will take
the field against the Business Col
lege gridmen.
This first-string lineup will con
sist of Schott, left end; Beedle, left
tackle; Hurley, left guard; Bergman,
center; Walton, right guard; Tsout- I
souvas, right tackle; Schouteau,
right end; Vigna, quarterback; Wil
liams, left halfback; Turretto, right !
halfback; and Ledbetter, lullback.
With Hurley, Walton, Tsoutsouvas,
and Schouteau all tipping the scales
at about 200 pounds, the yearlings'
line averages as about the heaviest j
a first-year team has had at Stan
ford in many years. Beedle, at 195,
is not far behind his heavier col
leagues in weight, while Bergman,
.175, and Schott, 180, are big enough
to take care of themselves in any !
company.
Speed, rather than weight, pre
dominates in the backfield, al- ;
though Ledbetter at full weighs
around 195. Vigna and Williams
are said to be the boys to watch
if ever they get in an open field
while Turretto is the star kicker
of the squad. Ledbetter is the
hard driving type of fullback who
is not too scrupulous about bowl
ing over any opposing players who
chance to get in his way. Brent,
reserve quarterback, is another of
Bradshaw's speedy ball - carriers
who will probably see service to
morrow.
Although not in uniform last night
as a result of the gashed forehead he
picked up in practice Wednesday,
Jack Walton, a newcomer, is ex
pected to be in good condition when
he makes his bow in Stanford foot
ball tomorrow. Schott, out for ten
days or so with a broken toe, is
ready to go in at end after being on
the sidelines last week when the
frosh played Modesto Junior Col
lege.
The yearlings' two earlier games
both ended in 7 to 6 victories over
San Mateo and Modesto Junior Col
leges.

the field against the Business Col
lege gridmen.
This first-string lineup will con
sist of Schott, left end; Beedle, left
tackle; Hurley, left guard; Bergman,
center; Walton, right guard; Tsout- I
souvas, right tackle; Schouteau,
right end; Vigna, quarterback; Wil
liams, left halfback; Turretto, right !
halfback; and Ledbetter, lullback.
With Hurley, Walton, Tsoutsouvas,
and Schouteau all tipping the scales
at about 200 pounds, the yearlings'
line averages as about the heaviest j
a first-year team has had at Stan
ford in many years. Beedle, at 195,
is not far behind his heavier col
leagues in weight, while Bergman,
.175, and Schott, 180, are big enough
to take care of themselves in any !
company.
Speed, rather than weight, pre
dominates in the backfield, al- ;
though Ledbetter at full weighs
around 195. Vigna and Williams
are said to be the boys to watch
if ever they get in an open field
while Turretto is the star kicker
of the squad. Ledbetter is the
hard driving type of fullback who
is not too scrupulous about bowl
ing over any opposing players who
chance to get in his way. Brent,
reserve quarterback, is another of
Bradshaw's speedy ball - carriers
who will probably see service to
morrow.
Although not in uniform last night
as a result of the gashed forehead he
picked up in practice Wednesday,
Jack Walton, a newcomer, is ex
pected to be in good condition when
he makes his bow in Stanford foot
ball tomorrow. Schott, out for ten
days or so with a broken toe, is
ready to go in at end after being on
the sidelines last week when the
frosh played Modesto Junior Col
lege.
The yearlings' two earlier games
both ended in 7 to 6 victories over
San Mateo and Modesto Junior Col
leges.
Facing a team of unknown power
| whose early season's record is like
wise veiled in mystery, Stanford's
1933 freshman football outfit makes
its third public appearance tomor-
I row against Armstrong Business
College of Oakland. Played as a
' preliminary to the varsity's battle
j with Santa Clara, the game will be
j gin at 12 o'clock.
Although not expected to give
much trouble, the visitors will
have to he taken in stride in any
! case, since Coach Jimrnie Brad
| shaw is alrea'dy pointing his
charges toward next Saturday's
struggle with (he S.C. Trobabes.
Whatever the Indians run into in
tomorrow's game, they will prob
ably be amply prepared for it since
their eleven best players will take
the field against the Business Col
lege gridmen.
