# New Backfield Bear's Threat To St. Mary's
## 
### 
Opening with an entirely new
starting backfield. California's Bears
trot onto the field at Berkeley to
morrow to meet St. Mary's in a
game which may knock out one of
the leading contenders for the na
tional grid championship.
The Galloping Gaels, the only
team on the Coast given a chance
to squeeze out a victory over S.C.,
will probably go into tomorrow's
game with instructions from Slip
Madigan to hold back their deep
stuff to save it for El Trojan the
following week, for St. Mary's
would rather level Southern Cali
fornia than any other squad on
their schedule.
California, with its new backfield,
will probably open up with the
widely advertised attack Ingram has
been preparing. Cal Varner, who
won his spurs in the Nevada game
last week with a series of brilliant
runs, will open at Arleigh Williams'
i post, while Jim Castle, a made-over
! lineman, will run at the other half.
Montford Reedy has displaced the
veterans, Chuck Stewart and Joe
Verducci, at quarter while Frank
Walker will get the call at fullback
over Jim Keefer, Milo Quislin, and
the sophomore star, Thorell.
Reports from Moraga are that the
Gaels will take to power plays
through the center of the line to
morrow instead of skirting the ends
as in the past. With a line which
javeiages 215 pounds, outweighing the
Bears 15 pounds a man, St. Mary's
should be able to punch the Cali
fcrnia line, although S.F.U. held
them four times inside the 10-yard
line last Sunday.
Despite their tremendous weight,
the Moragamen are not slow and
with three strong men for every
j backfield position should be able
(o avenge last season's 12-to-12 tie
by which a fighting Bear team
upset the odds and ruined St.
Mary's championship aspirations.
Sid A hern will bark signals for
the Gaels tomorrow, with George
Wilson and Al Nichelini at half
backs and George Dodson at full.
Kellogg, a sophomore, looked like
the class of the St. Mary's fullbacks
last Sunday against San Francisco
and should see plenty of action
while Gordon Partee, relegated to
third string after being a sensation
two years ago, has been running
wild in scrimmage this week and
may be the thorn in the Bear's side
tomorrow.

starting backfield. California's Bears
trot onto the field at Berkeley to
morrow to meet St. Mary's in a
game which may knock out one of
the leading contenders for the na
tional grid championship.
The Galloping Gaels, the only
team on the Coast given a chance
to squeeze out a victory over S.C.,
will probably go into tomorrow's
game with instructions from Slip
Madigan to hold back their deep
stuff to save it for El Trojan the
following week, for St. Mary's
would rather level Southern Cali
fornia than any other squad on
their schedule.
California, with its new backfield,
will probably open up with the
widely advertised attack Ingram has
been preparing. Cal Varner, who
won his spurs in the Nevada game
last week with a series of brilliant
runs, will open at Arleigh Williams'
i post, while Jim Castle, a made-over
! lineman, will run at the other half.
Montford Reedy has displaced the
veterans, Chuck Stewart and Joe
Verducci, at quarter while Frank
Walker will get the call at fullback
over Jim Keefer, Milo Quislin, and
the sophomore star, Thorell.
Reports from Moraga are that the
Gaels will take to power plays
through the center of the line to
morrow instead of skirting the ends
as in the past. With a line which
javeiages 215 pounds, outweighing the
Bears 15 pounds a man, St. Mary's
should be able to punch the Cali
fcrnia line, although S.F.U. held
them four times inside the 10-yard
line last Sunday.
Despite their tremendous weight,
the Moragamen are not slow and
with three strong men for every
j backfield position should be able
(o avenge last season's 12-to-12 tie
by which a fighting Bear team
upset the odds and ruined St.
Mary's championship aspirations.
Sid A hern will bark signals for
the Gaels tomorrow, with George
Wilson and Al Nichelini at half
backs and George Dodson at full.
Kellogg, a sophomore, looked like
the class of the St. Mary's fullbacks
last Sunday against San Francisco
and should see plenty of action
while Gordon Partee, relegated to
third string after being a sensation
two years ago, has been running
wild in scrimmage this week and
may be the thorn in the Bear's side
tomorrow.
