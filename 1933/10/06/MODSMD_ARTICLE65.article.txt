# University of Washington Enrollment Shows Gain

SEATTLE, Wash., Oct. 5 (P.1.P.)
—Substantial increase in the regis
tration at the University of Wash
ington is attributed to two measures
—the relaxation of entrance re
quirements, and decreased residence
tuition fees.
By easing the entrance require
ments, the plan lowered admission
bars to below a "C" average on pro
bation. The fee drop from $15 to
$10 removed a financial barrier. In
addition, a considerable portion of
the increased enrollment has been
attributed to NRA optimism.
Why, oh why, does free advice sa
vour of quantity instead of quality?
