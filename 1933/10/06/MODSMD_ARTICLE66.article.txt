# SENATORS SHUT OUT GIANTS TO WIN 4 TO 0 ON HOME GROUNDS AS ROOSEVELT WATCHES

### 
GRIFFITH STADIUM, Washing
ton, Oct. 5 (/P). —The prodigal base
• ball sons of Washington celebrated
( their return to home grounds today
by shutting out the New York
Giants, 4 to 0, under the combined
inspiration of Earl Whitehill's great
i southpaw pitching and the presence
of the nation's chief executive.
Despite pre-game showers and a
chilly breeze that swept the field,
President Roosevelt, his baseball
sympathies somewhat divided, joined
a crowd of 25,727 overcoated and
j befurred spectators in watching the
Senators snaj* out of their world
series slump.
Due to weather more suited to
football than baseball, the game
s .did not approach a sellout, but any.

j disappointment for the home club
on this account was eliminated by
the return to form of Joe Cro
t nin's crew.
After being buffeted and com
i pletely outplayed for two straight
games, the Senators gave a dishing,
peppery exhibition on their own
liattle ground. They belabored fat
j Freddy Fitzsimmons, the Giants'
veteran knuckle-bailer, for a three
run lead in the first two innings and
then coasted along confidently to
their first victory behind Whitehill's
masterful left-handed strategy.
WhitehiU, the top-ranking mem
ber of the Washington staff this
year, held the heretofore rollicking
and rampant Giants to five well dis
tributed hits, including Travis Jack
son's booming double.
