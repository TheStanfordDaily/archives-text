# GRID TICKET SALES SHOW RISE: S.C. AND BIG GAME DUCATS AVAILABLE MONDAY
## 
### 
Football ticket sales on the de
pression hit Stanford Farm are
gradually climbing back to normal,
according to Jake Irwin. B.A.C.
ticket manager, who yesterday de
clared a "picking up" could be seen
in his department.
Though ticket applications were
thi'j year sent to only four of the
11 ited States instead of the usual 18
and the fact that no student blanks
were mailed during the summer the
outlook is optimistic. Attendances
at preliminary games this season
have easily topped last year's marks.
Prices may be going up, but
football prices took a drop this
season. The biggest drop is in the
price of Rig Game ducats that
now sell for $4.40 instead of the
almost proverbial $5.50 that al
umni have grumbled about for so
long. In addition a $3 section of
less desirable seats has been set
aside.
Contrary to a previous announce
ment Big Game and .S.C. tickets
will not go on sale until Monday,

, Irwin said yesterday. Students have
been given a new deal in the num
ber of general admission tickets
available. They are now able lo get
one rooter's ticket and six general
admission ducats for the Trojan
clash and one rootar's ticket and
j four general admissions for the Big
Game,
The ticket window of the A.S.S.U.
office opens Monday when upon pre
scnation of S.B. cards students may
get their tickets.
