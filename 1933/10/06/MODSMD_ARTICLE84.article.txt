## Box Numbers On Letters Help Quick Delivery

Mail is distributed in the post of
fice boxes live times daily: 8:30 and
10:31) a.m., and 1, 5, and 6 in the
afternoon. The early morning mail
comes from the North and Eaut and
the 10:30 delivery more generally
from the South by bay districts.
Noon mail is the heaviest and in
clude:-; all Eastern, Northern, and
Western deliveries. The afternoon
mails are made up principally of
southern and bay district distribu
tions.
Complaint has been made about
ihe delayed delivery of some mail,
according to Postmaster W. C. Wor
ry. In regard to this, residents are
reminded to have their mail ad
dressed to the box numbers. This
aids not only the student in re
ceiving his mail more promptly, but
also Ihe post-office staff.
There are few boxes open for rent.
If students who are not receiving
their mail through general delivery
wish to take advantage of these
boxes, they should see either the
superintendent or any post office
clerk, according to the postmaster.
