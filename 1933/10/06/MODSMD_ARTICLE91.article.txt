MtIE SONG OF SONGS (Para
mount) at the Stanford Theatre.
II is difficult to recall any film
set in such spectacularly beautiful
effects as this adaptation of the
lengthy Sudermunn novel. Rouben
i Mamoulain, evidently eager to dis
i tinguish this effort from the Von
5 Steinberg school, has surrounded
| the star with every requisite for a
| winning picture except a story.
Fine Music I
Featuring a magnificent treatment
of a Tschaikowsky thfme, the musi
cal score is, without exception, the
finest this writer has ever heard
gracing a sound film. The German
start is surrounded by beautiful
photography, sets, and costumes.
In short, it is a picture which will
impress by its external effects but
which will suffer beneath a coolly (
critical eye.
Another of the long succession of
"full and rise" dramas, it treats of
the heroine's thwarted love for an
artist, her marriage to and subse-
quc-nt ejection by a be-monocled di
lettante. Throughout the film runs
the story of the artist's statue of
Lily—not to mention numerous
I shots (enter the Rough) of the
statue itself. It is here that the mu
sical score is especially excellent. j
The star herself does excellent
v.ork in the earlier portions of the
picture, when she appears as the
naive country girl. Her latter work (
is cut on much the same pattern as
| her other "worldly" interpretations.
Incidentally, she sings two songs.
Poor Role
Brian Aherne, hampered by a stu
pid role, a solemn expression, and
an apparently too stiff collar, docs
not make the signal impression that I
his stage successes would have led
one to expect.
Alison Skipworth gives her cus
tomary deft treatment to a charac
ter part, which impresses one as all
too small. As the dilettante, Lionel
Atwill is excellently cast and ac
quits himself. And poor Hardie Al- c
bright has another of his milk-and
water roles, heaven pity him.
