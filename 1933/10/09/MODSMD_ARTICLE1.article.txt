## from The Associated Press Bums' Rush 
### 
Lodi's labor trouble became con
tagious yesterday, violence break
ing out like smallpox in four central
California counties. Highways and
byways of Tulare, Kern, Kings and
Madera were littered with impro
vised deputies engaged in running
agitators out of the county, highway
police trying to maintain order,
farmers trying to keep cotton fields
free from picketing. Strikers were
on the run.
"Get-ready" meetings were widely
held, featured by the county author
ities' open advocacy of force, ex
cuse being that courts are too slow,
country teeming with alleged "reds"
using most anything handy, for
weapons. Deputy District Attorney
of Madera advocated castor oil to
keep strikers on the run. Castor oil
or no castor oil, the bums' rush con
tinues as does law-winking.
