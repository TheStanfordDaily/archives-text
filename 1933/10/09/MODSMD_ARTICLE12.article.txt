# Concert Sale Moving Well
## 
### 
! The "Back to the Farm" move
; ment has proved a decided success
j far the Concert Scries is con
j cerned, it was revealed yesterday
by Prentice Messimer, manager. Re
turns from the sale of season tickets
J have greatly surpassed those at the
I same time last year and the lower
' prices have proved themselves very
popular among the students.
During this week a canvassing
j campaign will be carried on in the
various living groups and all stu
dents are urged to take advantage
of the new low prices and get their
tickets early, since those signing up
first get Ihe best seats. A few of the
S>2 seats arc still available.
A fine program is presented by
the concert series this year includ
ing such famous names as Mischa
jElman, Teresina, John Charles
| Thomas, Walter Gieseking, and Rosa
Ponselle.
