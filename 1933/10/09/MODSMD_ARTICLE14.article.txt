# Annual Crook Robs Greeks
## Dekes Heaviest Losers As Visitor Takes $200 
### 
If the Greeks had a word for it,
they are using all of them now. The
reason: Stanford's almost annual
and most unwelcome visitor, the
fraternity robber, spent part of the
weekend on the Farm relieving the
members of some four fraternities
of cash estimated at $200. And Cali
fornia can sympathize, for the gen
tleman also appeared there.
Delta Kappa Epsiloii was the
heaviest loser, contributing some
$127; Phi Sigma Kappa followed
with a donation of $37. Kappa Al
pha and Delta Chi placed $Hl and
$27 at "Jimmie Valentine's" dis
posal.
Playing no favorites between the
ancient rivals, the robber visited
two houses on the Berkeley campus.
He was apprehended in one, but
managed to talk himself clear. The
description they gave places his age
in the early twenties, his height at
c bout five feet ten inches. He wore
a dark suit.
In connection with this robbery
and other minor thefts about the
campus, Police Officer Gordon D;i
vi.s issued the following statement:
"We are here to help protect these
fellows, but we can not do anythipgs
without their co-operation. In stop
ping petty thefts, it would be help
ful for the houses to arrange for
seme employee or member to slay
with the house during Saturday
afternoon games. If a strange man
is found in the house in ihe early
hours of the morning, call the cam
pus police and let the gentleman ex
plain to them. They will only too
gladly answer any summons."
