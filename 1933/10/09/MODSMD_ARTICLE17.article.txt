# EXCESS WOMEN MAKE HISTORY FOR RECEPTION
## Rough Stag Line Disappears As Women Abundant At President's Home 
### 
Confronted by Stanford history
jin the making were four upper
class-men roughs when they ap
j proached the home of President Ray
Lyman Wilbur Saturday night dur
| ing flic reception for new students.
The history: women were in
i abundance, men ' were scarce. Not
enough dancing partners were avail
able.
The four roughs assailed the door
man (bouncer without portfolio) but
he did not repulse them. "You may
come in if you wiil dance, but if you
don't dance, we wiil have to throw
you out," he chided.
Strive for Men
And women there were. So many,
in fact, that assistant hostesses jin
gled fraternity house phone bells,
called for volunteer dancers. Unpre
! ee.dented was the situation.

However, women assistants were
i loath to blame the situation on rude
i Stanford men who insisted on "see
ing the girls before you introduce
me' or who were looking for a cer
tain girl from '"my home town,"
! hence could dance with no other
| lady.
I Three women sponsors answered
I the trite question, "How do the
women look?" in an original man
ner when they said, "The girls gen
; orally look pretty nice, but a more
stupid bunch of men we have never
seen." No generalized statement on
pulchritude could be made from the
men's varied comments.
Wilbur Pleasant
New students commented, not
that they had shaken hands with
President Wilbur, but that he had
shaken hands with them. All were
pleased with his pleasant manner.
An innovation to provide more
room for dancing was a hardwood
platform erected on the lawn back
of the presidential mansion. Less
crowded than in previous years, the
mansion's dance floor was far from
I roomy.
In the receiving line were Dr. and
Mrs. Ray Lyman Wilbur, Dean of
I Men and Mrs. George B. Culver,
end Dean of Women Mary Yost.
Other members of the administra
tion were present and assisted in
receiving the students. Assistant
hostesses included women sponsors,
pan-hellenic president and the
women's editor of the Daily. As
sistant hosts included men sponsors,
student body president and the
men's council.

The history: women were in
i abundance, men ' were scarce. Not
enough dancing partners were avail
able.
The four roughs assailed the door
man (bouncer without portfolio) but
he did not repulse them. "You may
come in if you wiil dance, but if you
don't dance, we wiil have to throw
you out," he chided.
Strive for Men
And women there were. So many,
in fact, that assistant hostesses jin
gled fraternity house phone bells,
called for volunteer dancers. Unpre
! ee.dented was the situation.

However, women assistants were
i loath to blame the situation on rude
i Stanford men who insisted on "see
ing the girls before you introduce
me' or who were looking for a cer
tain girl from '"my home town,"
! hence could dance with no other
| lady.
I Three women sponsors answered
I the trite question, "How do the
women look?" in an original man
ner when they said, "The girls gen
; orally look pretty nice, but a more
stupid bunch of men we have never
seen." No generalized statement on
pulchritude could be made from the
men's varied comments.
Wilbur Pleasant
New students commented, not
that they had shaken hands with
President Wilbur, but that he had
shaken hands with them. All were
pleased with his pleasant manner.
An innovation to provide more
room for dancing was a hardwood
platform erected on the lawn back
of the presidential mansion. Less
crowded than in previous years, the
mansion's dance floor was far from
I roomy.
In the receiving line were Dr. and
Mrs. Ray Lyman Wilbur, Dean of
I Men and Mrs. George B. Culver,
end Dean of Women Mary Yost.
Other members of the administra
tion were present and assisted in
receiving the students. Assistant
hostesses included women sponsors,
pan-hellenic president and the
women's editor of the Daily. As
sistant hosts included men sponsors,
student body president and the
men's council.
