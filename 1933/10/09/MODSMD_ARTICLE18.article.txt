# INCIDENT

Whatever their faults (and
who said they had any?), never
let it be said that the new
women arc inconsiderate. As
witness a gentle little episode
which transpired at the late la
mented president's reception.
It seems that Mary Rath, as
a good Pan-Hellenic president
should be, was among those
present. She was observed
standing near the door. Later,
an astute freshman woman re
turned to note that she was still
standing near the door.
Kindly, sympathetically, and
solicitously, this freshman re
marked to the Pan-Hell prexy:
"Oh, you poor thing! Are you
still stuck here by the door?"
