Hearst-like, lecture - drumming
Upton Close got off the boat at Vic
toria, 8.C., got in the A.P. in same
motion. Said Close: "Japan is defi
nitely and methodically preparing
to force the U.S. out of the west Pa
cific picture." Close, who had taiked
a lot, annoyed Japanese; hence,
stayed out of Manchukuo by re
quest. Mr. Close will shortly be on
the lecture programs of all the
states. The Yellow Peril returns.
