# Character Subject Of Matriculation Sermon
## 
### 
"Character" was the subject of
Reverend Dorothy Wilson's sermon
yesterday to the entering students
al the matriculation service. Char
acter is vital, not as the thing
marked, but rather as "the thing
that makes the mark," she told the
new students, who crowded the
nave of the Memorial Church.
Students must do more than make
an adjustment, Reverend Wilson
said. Adjusting may be a passive
filling in; character is active, the
power to mold, use, transform.
Reverend Wilson described three
types of character: the slave, who
lies down; the person who kicks at
the whole business and is best rep
resented by "two legs, both kick
ing," the third character, the high
est, is the son who tries to under
stand life; find strives to find the
best and carry it on.
Mrs. Noel Walster Bryant sung
the anthem, Gounod's "Lovely Ap
peal," supported by the choir.
