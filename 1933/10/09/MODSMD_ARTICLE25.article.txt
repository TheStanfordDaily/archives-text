# Aerial Broncs Find Strength Of Indians Seven Points Better
## Grayson Bucks For Stanford Score As Passing Game And Kicking Defense Of Santa Clara Stopped By Tough Breaks And Indian Punters 
### BY SPUD HAMILTON 
DEAKING the unpopular end of a 7-0 score, the Santa Clara Bronco
departed from Stanford Stadium Saturday, with his tamed speedster,
Frisky Kaliski, stalled behind the lines, his famed aerial (lirusts denied h,v
luck, his famed kicking game thwarted, his famed coach raging, and his
famed nether portions well blistered.
And all the uproar because a Santa Clara strategem resulted in failure
in the opening moments of play, because |{ul> Maentz' kicking toe matched

► the great Paglia in that first quar
| tcr, because A1 Norgard spilled a
. Bronco play and caused Kaliski to
fumble that Ben Palamountain
I might recover, because Bobby Gray
son possessed a driving punch sadly
lacking in Stanford teams since the
palmy days of Ernie Nevers.
And when Grayson boomed over
the Bronc right guard on that final
two-yard drive that resulted in a
touchdown, the coffin-kicking Broncs
were securely nailed in their own
coffin by seven big points.

Oddly enough, the old Bronc
j caused considerable of a commoaon
in the corral before Tiny Thornnill's
Lai rupin' Lariateers had him well
busted in the final quarter. That
| passing attack led by the great So
| brero, than whom there is no one

| whomer at the art of the pogo pass,
! gave the Stanford side of the sta
; diutn some agonized moments and
the Stanford pass defense consider
able consternation before the final
gun stopped the carnage.
1 Time after time unerring shots
from the leaping Bronco left half
sought out the receptive arms of
McCoy, Arnerich, Salatino, Bech
rich, and Britschgi. Two of those
j long heaves came near resulting in
. disaster for the Indians, once near
the end of the first half when So
brtro faded well back pursued by
I Stanford's Reynolds and sped the
; ball 40 yards to a pair of Santa
Ciara receivers waiting near the
Stanford 40-yard line. One reached
i for the ball, deflected it; McCoy
gathered it in and raced to the Stan
j ford goal line. But Referee Evans'
whistle called the play back.
Dowd Drops Poss
Precisely the same play worked
again to the Stanford 44, a span this
j time of 36 yards. Again in the last
quarter after Sobrero had success
fully passed to Bechrich for a 33-
yard gain to reach the Stanford
, nine-yard line, he hurled a pass into
I the end zone where two Broncs, Ar
nerich and Dowd fumbled for the
i ball and dropped it.
Thornhill played 'em close to his
i vest, removing the booming full-
I back Grayson after his scoring drive
was over, and inserting the veteran
' Ilillman for defense. In the third
i quarter when the Bronco passing
i wave carried clear to the Stanford
two-yard line, Hillman went out in
! favor of Alustiza the kicker. From
his own goal line, the full rounded
leg of Alustiza drove out a soaring
punt that carried past Salatino to
Ihe Santa Clara 35-yard stripe.
From there, it was a battle be
tween the leaping Sobrero and the
Cardinal pass defenders with the
! outcome a toss-up to the final gun.
The Bronco end-running threat and
r .ultiple spinners were stopped cold
on every play with the Stanford
ends and tackles enjoying a field
day at the expense of the opponents'
interference, while the Stanford
halves came up to cut down the run
ner. So effective was*the line de
fense that Santa Clara's running
gains went for a minus average.
Stanford Scores;
Stanford's score came early in the
first quarter after Paglia's on-side
kick of the kick-off was returned
by Maentz to the Santa Clyra 41.
Santa Clara remained on the defen
sive during this period. Bates' re
covery of Kaliski's fumble on the
Santa Clara 37-yard mark started a
drive that ended when Salatino in
tercepted Grayson's pass on ihe 26.
The ball went right back to Stan
ford when Palamountain dove on
the ball after Kaliski had fumbled
on his own 15-yard !i#ie. From that
point it was all Grayson. Grayson
for three, Grayson for five, Maentz
for two and a first down on the
Bronco five-yard line. Grayson for
three at left tackle, Maentz for half
a yard at left tackle. Santa Clara
called time out and when play was
resumed, Grayson drove over right
tackle through a nice hole for the
touchdown. Corbus converted.

by Maentz to the Santa Clyra 41.
Santa Clara remained on the defen
sive during this period. Bates' re
covery of Kaliski's fumble on the
Santa Clara 37-yard mark started a
drive that ended when Salatino in
tercepted Grayson's pass on ihe 26.
The ball went right back to Stan
ford when Palamountain dove on
the ball after Kaliski had fumbled
on his own 15-yard !i#ie. From that
point it was all Grayson. Grayson
for three, Grayson for five, Maentz
for two and a first down on the
Bronco five-yard line. Grayson for
three at left tackle, Maentz for half
a yard at left tackle. Santa Clara
called time out and when play was
resumed, Grayson drove over right
tackle through a nice hole for the
touchdown. Corbus converted.
DEAKING the unpopular end of a 7-0 score, the Santa Clara Bronco
departed from Stanford Stadium Saturday, with his tamed speedster,
Frisky Kaliski, stalled behind the lines, his famed aerial (lirusts denied h,v
luck, his famed kicking game thwarted, his famed coach raging, and his
famed nether portions well blistered.
And all the uproar because a Santa Clara strategem resulted in failure
in the opening moments of play, because |{ul> Maentz' kicking toe matched

► the great Paglia in that first quar
| tcr, because A1 Norgard spilled a
. Bronco play and caused Kaliski to
fumble that Ben Palamountain
I might recover, because Bobby Gray
son possessed a driving punch sadly
lacking in Stanford teams since the
palmy days of Ernie Nevers.
And when Grayson boomed over
the Bronc right guard on that final
two-yard drive that resulted in a
touchdown, the coffin-kicking Broncs
were securely nailed in their own
coffin by seven big points.

Oddly enough, the old Bronc

1 Time after time unerring shots
from the leaping Bronco left half

the end of the first half when So
brtro faded well back pursued by
I Stanford's Reynolds and sped the
; ball 40 yards to a pair of Santa
Ciara receivers waiting near the
Stanford 40-yard line. One reached
i for the ball, deflected it; McCoy

Precisely the same play worked
again to the Stanford 44, a span this
j time of 36 yards. Again in the last
quarter after Sobrero had success
fully passed to Bechrich for a 33-
yard gain to reach the Stanford
, nine-yard line, he hurled a pass into
I the end zone where two Broncs, Ar
nerich and Dowd fumbled for the
i ball and dropped it.
Thornhill played 'em close to his
i vest, removing the booming full-
I back Grayson after his scoring drive
was over, and inserting the veteran
' Ilillman for defense. In the third
i quarter when the Bronco passing
i wave carried clear to the Stanford
two-yard line, Hillman went out in
! favor of Alustiza the kicker. From
his own goal line, the full rounded
leg of Alustiza drove out a soaring
punt that carried past Salatino to
Ihe Santa Clara 35-yard stripe.
From there, it was a battle be
tween the leaping Sobrero and the
Cardinal pass defenders with the
! outcome a toss-up to the final gun.
The Bronco end-running threat and
r .ultiple spinners were stopped cold
on every play with the Stanford
ends and tackles enjoying a field
day at the expense of the opponents'
interference, while the Stanford
halves came up to cut down the run
ner. So effective was*the line de

punt that carried past Salatino to
Ihe Santa Clara 35-yard stripe.
From there, it was a battle be
tween the leaping Sobrero and the
Cardinal pass defenders with the
! outcome a toss-up to the final gun.
The Bronco end-running threat and
r .ultiple spinners were stopped cold
on every play with the Stanford
ends and tackles enjoying a field
day at the expense of the opponents'
interference, while the Stanford
halves came up to cut down the run
ner. So effective was*the line de
fense that Santa Clara's running
gains went for a minus average.
Stanford Scores;
Stanford's score came early in the
first quarter after Paglia's on-side
kick of the kick-off was returned
by Maentz to the Santa Clyra 41.
Santa Clara remained on the defen
sive during this period. Bates' re
covery of Kaliski's fumble on the
Santa Clara 37-yard mark started a
drive that ended when Salatino in
tercepted Grayson's pass on ihe 26.
The ball went right back to Stan
ford when Palamountain dove on
the ball after Kaliski had fumbled
on his own 15-yard !i#ie. From that
point it was all Grayson. Grayson
for three, Grayson for five, Maentz
for two and a first down on the
Bronco five-yard line. Grayson for
three at left tackle, Maentz for half
a yard at left tackle. Santa Clara
called time out and when play was
resumed, Grayson drove over right
tackle through a nice hole for the
touchdown. Corbus converted.
DEAKING the unpopular end of a 7-0 score, the Santa Clara Bronco
departed from Stanford Stadium Saturday, with his tamed speedster,
Frisky Kaliski, stalled behind the lines, his famed aerial (lirusts denied h,v
luck, his famed kicking game thwarted, his famed coach raging, and his
famed nether portions well blistered.
And all the uproar because a Santa Clara strategem resulted in failure
in the opening moments of play, because |{ul> Maentz' kicking toe matched

► the great Paglia in that first quar
| tcr, because A1 Norgard spilled a
. Bronco play and caused Kaliski to
fumble that Ben Palamountain
I might recover, because Bobby Gray
son possessed a driving punch sadly
lacking in Stanford teams since the
palmy days of Ernie Nevers.
And when Grayson boomed over
the Bronc right guard on that final
two-yard drive that resulted in a
touchdown, the coffin-kicking Broncs
were securely nailed in their own
coffin by seven big points.
Sobrero Stars
Oddly enough, the old Bronc
j caused considerable of a commoaon
in the corral before Tiny Thornnill's
Lai rupin' Lariateers had him well
busted in the final quarter. That
| passing attack led by the great So
| brero, than whom there is no one

| whomer at the art of the pogo pass,
! gave the Stanford side of the sta
; diutn some agonized moments and
the Stanford pass defense consider
able consternation before the final
gun stopped the carnage.
1 Time after time unerring shots
from the leaping Bronco left half
sought out the receptive arms of
McCoy, Arnerich, Salatino, Bech
rich, and Britschgi. Two of those
j long heaves came near resulting in
. disaster for the Indians, once near
the end of the first half when So
brtro faded well back pursued by
I Stanford's Reynolds and sped the
; ball 40 yards to a pair of Santa
Ciara receivers waiting near the
Stanford 40-yard line. One reached
i for the ball, deflected it; McCoy
gathered it in and raced to the Stan
j ford goal line. But Referee Evans'
whistle called the play back.
Dowd Drops Poss
Precisely the same play worked
again to the Stanford 44, a span this
j time of 36 yards. Again in the last
quarter after Sobrero had success
fully passed to Bechrich for a 33-
yard gain to reach the Stanford
, nine-yard line, he hurled a pass into
I the end zone where two Broncs, Ar
nerich and Dowd fumbled for the
i ball and dropped it.
Thornhill played 'em close to his
i vest, removing the booming full-
I back Grayson after his scoring drive
was over, and inserting the veteran
' Ilillman for defense. In the third
i quarter when the Bronco passing
i wave carried clear to the Stanford
two-yard line, Hillman went out in
! favor of Alustiza the kicker. From
his own goal line, the full rounded
leg of Alustiza drove out a soaring
punt that carried past Salatino to
Ihe Santa Clara 35-yard stripe.
From there, it was a battle be
tween the leaping Sobrero and the
Cardinal pass defenders with the
! outcome a toss-up to the final gun.
