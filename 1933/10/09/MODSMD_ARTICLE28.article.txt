Anita Loos has scored her biggest
dramatic win in two years of ca
vorting on the creaky and breezy
stage of the Assembly Hall.
To be .specific, the well-known
campus actress and Masque i3all
Queen runner-up will play a Shaw
heroine.
Shaw Heroine Hole
To go into details, .she will play
Raina, the lead role in "Arms and
the Man," with which Harold ll'.'l
venston will dazzle the • campus 011
November third, next.
Kaina is one of the most inter
esting Shaw heroines (not ex
cepting Cleopatra), and from her
first appearance in nightgown to
the final clinch, she provides no
little excitement. The fact that
she feeds chocolate creams to the
soldier who invades the sanctity
of her bedchamber is the impetus
foi much of the action.
George Leavens, the lad with "the
Oxford accent, will devote his tal
ents (and evenings from 7 to .19) to
the part of Sergius, fiance but never
husband to the histrionic Raina.
Leavens also appeared, but. did not
get the girl, in "Death Takes a Holi
day" and "The Mad Hopes."
Marvin Plays Mother
Tall, blonde, black-eyed, Virginia
Marvin is the chief's choice for the
role of Catherine, mother to Kaina
and general stirrer-up of action.
Miss Marvin previously exercised
her rather dramatic voice on the
University of Washington stage.
PetkofT, husband to Catherine,
owner of a library, and a fairly stu
pid fellow, will be interpreted by
Pcul Crary, who, despite the fact
that his sister was a well-known
local thespian, has made a reputa
tion in his own right. Crary's chief
characteristics are a noticeable lowei
jaw and a noticeable ability for dra
matic characterization.
The chocolate soldier, Klnntschli,
will be played by the pride of (In-
Chi Psi's, John Henry Peckharo,
"Johnny" in his fan mail ....
The remainder of the cast the
newly-discovered Jean Albertson,
and the playwriting Waldo Salt, and
Prussian officer George Fuller w< n*
previously announced.
Doting father Ilclvenslon fared
one of his toughest tasks in the
casting of this show, but, say■> he,
"II looks like a winner."
