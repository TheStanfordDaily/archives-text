# NRA Monkey Wrenches
## 
### 
Increasing numbers of strikes
sharply raise the issue of Labor's
moral obligation as a recovery pro
gram partner to Government and
Industry Saturday, President Roose
velt roundly assailed NRA monkey
wrench throwers, likened recalci
trants to kicking horses needing
corralling. Occasion was a memo
rial dedication in Washington to the
late, great Samuel Gompers. Char
acterizing the labor leader as having
evisioned many NRA principles, F.R.
deplored "hotheads" in' worker
ranks who try getting results by
noise and violence thus .spoiling
A.F.L. chances.
While the President touched upon
prime NRA impediment: General
Johnson can crack down on em
ployers who violate codes, but is
powerless to discipline employees
who violate its spirit. Labor has not
surrendered its right to strike; has
used this weapon to force union rec
ognition from rabidly anti-union
U.S. Steel mine operators. Result:
latter, faced with complete tit-up
ini strife-torn Pennsylvania, are
ready to negotiate. But all is not
quiet on the strike front; guerilla
warfare is still going on in coal
mining districts. A.F.L. in conven
tion demands a larger part in NRA
policy and approves of the strike.
To bolster up its beginning-to
crcak machinery, NRA's executives
ti'day open a "Now is the time to
buy" campaign, hoping for less
ballyhoo, more results. Ultimate
end: more prosperity.
