# Why Football Trips?
## 
### 
Our football friends always told us that there wore two
reasons for sending llie Stanford eleven scampering over
this great continent. Reason one: II built up gridiron in
terest and therefore gale receipts. Reason two: Intersec
tional panics prove which team is the national best. Why
this must he demonstrated is never made quite clear; hut
enough that the national champion is thus selected.
Rut yesterday a Stanford tackle suffering from an in
jured ankle was sent Kast. Rv no stretch of heroics can he
plav. He was sent because he "deserved" to go.
That sounds as if trips were doled out as rewards for
services rendered. If this is the case, then the hovs surely
are underpaid. Three trips for a season's heating is indeed
poor compensation. The Fuller Rrush salesmen gel better
than thai.
A painfully injured tackle on the Stanford bench in
Chicago will not aid gate receipts, will not help Stanford
win. II musl be that he was sent East as a reward for his
splendid work in llie Santa Clara and other games.
II must be that football rewards arc more important
ihan gathering the jewels of learning. Otherwise the in
jured man would be left on the library steps—having by
his injury'earned the right to higher education.
