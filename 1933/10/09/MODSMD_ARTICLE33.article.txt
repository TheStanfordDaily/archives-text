# Trying to Get Along

"Listen l<> who's talking. Journalists! Peeking through
keyholes! Hunning after fire engines like a lot of coach
dogs! Waking people up in the middle of the night to ask
Ihein what they think of Mussolini. Stealing pictures off
old ladies of their daughters that get kidnapped in Oak
Mark. And for what? So a million hired girls and motor
men's wives'll know what's going on."
Newspapermen at Stanford do not quite lit into the pie
hire of the Chicago press sketched in the quotation from
"The Front Page." Thev are more likely to trail football
coaches and players to get a new slant on the team; phone
professors at any hour to find out what they think of the
sales tax; and turn out their own pictures of campus life
and jiII that students, faculty members, a few scattered
alumni and parents may know what is going on.
Today some forty enthusiastic, aspiring reporters will
cover the campus to dig up what news they may find in
order to earn a place on the masthead of the Daily. The
job is new to most of them.
We hope that thev will be met with friendly tolerance.
After all they are only youngsters trying to gel along.
