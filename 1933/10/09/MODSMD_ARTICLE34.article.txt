Rally Committees and Yell Leaders are eontinually
tearing I heir lungs and inventing strange stunts to awaken
what thev eall "spirit" in the student body. Hy spirit, they
mean yelling like hali'-mad at the games; yelling like half
mad at all the rallies; appearing half-mad generally.
The Santa Clara game proved that "spirit" (according
to Rally Committee de(inition) needs no artificial stimulus.
The football team did what no rally could ever do. It made
the stands a howling mob. They howled for only one rea
son. They were excited at the fighting spectacle. They
were thrilled bv the spectacular play.
The game proved one important fallacy. Our leaders
I*â–  11 us that a stand full of spirit whips the team on to
greater things. The game proved that the reverse is true.
The team really engenders spirit in the rooters. A dead
team and the rooters bask in the sun. A slashing attack
and the rooters jump up and down to the accompaniment
of their own yelling!
Saturday's spcctable proved that as a utilitarian insti
lulion, the rooting section is ;i dodo (non-existent). The
typical rally palaver- that we must yell so that the team
will win is decidedly fallacious. The rooting section has
only two purposes. Purpose one: to amuse the paying cus
tomers. Purpose two: to amuse the rooters themselves.
