# BULL SESSION
## "RETURN ENGAGEMENT—NEW CAST" 
### 
Editor's Note: The Bull Session l
again comes to life. For the time
lieing, at least, it will be written
by various members of the Daily
stall. The first effort, b> a Daily
Associate Editor, follows:
Trying to write the Bull Session
makes me think of Tad's blind man
—who was in a dark room hunting
for a black hat that wasn't there. I
know how that blind man felt. Fol
lowing in Abe's footsteps gives a
similar feeling of futility. One al
ways felt that Abe had private in
side information on everything:
probably a personal spy in the
League of Nations, and a dictaphone
secreted in President Wilbur's office.
But even without the aid of such
useful things as information and in
telligence, the Bull Session will stag
ger on, since if The Daily is to be
something more than merely a tam
pus Bulletin Board, it must contain
criticism and commentary.
They told me it would be easy to
write this column. It was simply a
question of finding enough things
to be mad at. When a would-be
writer can't write about anything |
else, he can always put his preju
dices on paper. The result is a Bull
Session.
The purpose is to attack ideas, not
personalities, but if a few toes get
stepped on in the process it can't
be helped. A columnist who doesn't
occasionally arouse dislike bee.iuse
of his opinions, has either not writ
ten well or has not been read. A
writer can't please everyone, so he
may as well loegin by pleasing him
self. And a person has the right to
censure if he has the desire to help.

Whether column and reader agree
is not important. Discussion of a
subject in a newspaper will not de
termine the reader's opinion on that
subject, but it will determine that
the reader has an opinion on that
subject.
Of course I know that nothing in
the world carries less weight with
a college student than the opinion
of another collegian, especially if
the latter is an amateur journalist.
A football hero walking quiotly
across the Quad attracts more at
tention than would the whole Daily
staff marching two abreast, headed
by a brass band and with the editor
spinning cartwheels.
Still, another person's opinions are
always interesting, even if you don't
agree with them. Opinions are ob
noxious only when they ars insisted
upon. Such as those, for example,
of the D.A.R.'s, whose insisted-upon
prejudices cause acute distress to a
civilized person, like a bad piece
of road that holds you up just as
you are passing a dead mule.
The Bull Sessioner will try not to
have the kind of strong convictions
which accompany ignorance. Knowl
edge generally brings doubt. Ask
the man in the street for an expla
nation of electricity. He will say
with confidence, "You just press the
button." Ask the working electri
cian. His answer will take half an
hour and will include a reason for
every form of electrical phenomena.
Then ask a physicist. He will prob
ably throw up his hands and confess
that he hasn't the faintest idea.
