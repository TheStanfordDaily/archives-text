# Cuban Chaos
## 
### 
Chaotic Cuba had by no means
settled down. Snipers were snipping
from house tops, soldiers were run
ning up and down seeking hidden
arms. Things were pretty usual. One
step to the peace, a reported deal
between the Student Directory and
President "Prof." Grau y Martin
was balanced by one pace to the so
cial war; Santiago labor unions were
continuing their general strike, Ha
vana groups were set for theirs.
Food supplies were short.
Revolutions, social disorders, visu
ally have economic cause for prime
mover. Cuba's case is no exception.
Liberal, lovable Uncle Sam took
Cuba from Spain in '98. Set her up
for new life and destiny on a
Platt-amendment string. One-crop,
sugar island Cuba got along well
enough till cane-sugar-raisers and
Philippine interests raised tariff
walls. Collapse of worlcf sugar
prices and U.S. protectionism have
been strangling her since the war.
Only fundamental relief for excita
ble, hungry Cuba and anxious, fath
erly Uncle Sam would be a one-cent
tariff reduction. Question: could
pcace on the border mean more to
u congressman than the sugar lobby?

I peal will neither balance budgets
| nor revive trade. It means drunken
. fathers and MOTHERS." Mother
-1 loving Stanford students may well
i be alarmed.
