THE SUMMER SEASON: ll—The
.... Cinema.
Of a dreary Sunday morning it J
is a weary, stale, flat, and unprofi- ,
table task to undertake an evalua- j
tion of the summer cinema—a task '
which generally involves the selec
tion and praise, with gestures, of
the best picture of the period.
As a matter of fact, the only
kind of passion 1 can work my
self. into is to comment on Fox's
opus magnus, "Pilgrimage," to
which I award the undisputed
Croix de GufT. An unctuous cf- ;
fort to jerk tears from the aged i
and helpless, it combines (1) the
"Silver Cord" theme, and (2) a
glorification of—of all things—the
Gold Star Mothers. The result
was pretty nauseating.
With that diatribe off my type
writer, I feel better, and can iurn
to the happier things of the .sum
mer, namely excellent transcriptions
of three stage plays.
"Reunion in Vienna" improved on
the local stage presentation, chiefly
in the matter of unity, and pre- 1
sented John Barry more as the
Prince, a performance full of gusto
and charm. Diana Wynyard, .some
what miscast, managed at least to
be lovely.
"When Ladies Meet'"' was a faith- i
ful transcription of Rachel Croth- j
tvs' problem comedy and, like the I
play, suffered from the spinelessness \
of the male characters. It pre- j
sented Ann Harding in a charming :
performance, and Alice Brady in a
highly exaggerated interpretation of !
a highly exaggerated character.
"Another Language" gave Helen j
Hayes little opportunity, had an i
unsatisfactory ending, and displayed !
the worst lot of relatives ever per- !
pet rated —and yet managed tt> be j
entertaining.
The musical field appropriated
I>> "Forty Second Street" was in- j
vuded by "Moonlight and Pret- |
zels" and "Gold Diggers of 1933," I
both of which I am happy to say j
I missed.
Ann Harding scored again in ;
"Double Harness," with William I
Powell as a charming foil. Another j
appealing light opus was "Midnight ;
Club." Mary Boland impressed in j
two films, "Mama Loves Papa"
(with Charles Ruggles), and "Three
Cornered Moon"; the latter was al
most Marxian in its delightful idi
ocy.
A quietly distinguished perform- |
ance was turned in by Lionel Bar- j
rymore in "Stranger's Return," one
of the most intelligent films of the I
season; he was ably supported by i
Miriam Hopkins and Franchot Tone. |
Two pictures which took things I
pretty seriously were "The Eagle and
the Hawk" (war), and "Voltaire"
(liberty). Almost ludicrously .seri
ous was "What Price Innocence?"
all about a girl whose mother didn't
tell her the f. of 1.
Mildly amusing were "The Pen
guin Pool Murder," "Bed of Roses,"
and "Private Detective 62."
And that, while it hardly cleans
tip the matter, at least dusts it
off. — Chapin

THE SUMMER SEASON: ll—The
.... Cinema.
Of a dreary Sunday morning it J
is a weary, stale, flat, and unprofi- ,
table task to undertake an evalua- j
tion of the summer cinema—a task '
which generally involves the selec
tion and praise, with gestures, of
the best picture of the period.
As a matter of fact, the only
kind of passion 1 can work my
self. into is to comment on Fox's
opus magnus, "Pilgrimage," to
which I award the undisputed
Croix de GufT. An unctuous cf- ;
fort to jerk tears from the aged i
and helpless, it combines (1) the
"Silver Cord" theme, and (2) a
glorification of—of all things—the
Gold Star Mothers. The result
was pretty nauseating.
With that diatribe off my type
writer, I feel better, and can iurn
to the happier things of the .sum
mer, namely excellent transcriptions
of three stage plays.
"Reunion in Vienna" improved on
the local stage presentation, chiefly
in the matter of unity, and pre- 1
sented John Barry more as the
Prince, a performance full of gusto
and charm. Diana Wynyard, .some
what miscast, managed at least to
be lovely.
"When Ladies Meet'"' was a faith- i
ful transcription of Rachel Croth- j
tvs' problem comedy and, like the I
play, suffered from the spinelessness \
of the male characters. It pre- j
sented Ann Harding in a charming :
performance, and Alice Brady in a
highly exaggerated interpretation of !
a highly exaggerated character.
"Another Language" gave Helen j
Hayes little opportunity, had an i
unsatisfactory ending, and displayed !
the worst lot of relatives ever per- !
pet rated —and yet managed tt> be j
entertaining.
The musical field appropriated
I>> "Forty Second Street" was in- j
vuded by "Moonlight and Pret- |
zels" and "Gold Diggers of 1933," I
both of which I am happy to say j
I missed.
Ann Harding scored again in ;
"Double Harness," with William I
Powell as a charming foil. Another j
appealing light opus was "Midnight ;
Club." Mary Boland impressed in j
two films, "Mama Loves Papa"
(with Charles Ruggles), and "Three
Cornered Moon"; the latter was al
most Marxian in its delightful idi
ocy.
A quietly distinguished perform- |
ance was turned in by Lionel Bar- j
rymore in "Stranger's Return," one
of the most intelligent films of the I
season; he was ably supported by i
Miriam Hopkins and Franchot Tone. |
Two pictures which took things I
pretty seriously were "The Eagle and
the Hawk" (war), and "Voltaire"
(liberty). Almost ludicrously .seri
ous was "What Price Innocence?"
