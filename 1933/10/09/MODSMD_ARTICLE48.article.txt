J. DROFNATS TO
THE FORE AGAIN
Saturday night and we met John
ny Drofnats reeling out of Ben's
Beer Bog. Johnny was well bogged,
and no wonder, for he had just
completed a nigh-perfect day at hat,
picking five out of six winners in
Saturday's games.
"Ho, ho!" he greeted us in a
throaty whisper, "can I pick 'em.
Can 1 pick 'em. Of course, just ;
a little hit off in one or two, but j
a pretty fair average for a back
country prognosticator. And did
you bet on St. Mary's? Ho, ho,
ho!"
He gestured with a pretzel in the
manner of a prof with a pieca of I
chalk. "Ah, but those Gaels fooled I
me. Never thought it would be so !
ciose. And U.S.C. Wait 'till I find)
the guy who told me the Trojans |
were slipping. But how did you like ;
the U.C.L.A.-Utah score. That's j
calling 'em on a line, son. Of :
course, I was slightly off on Idaho- I
Whitman, but this guy Willis Smith j
is too good. And the only one I j
really missed was Gonzag'a and it
W!!s a tie."
WHERE ARE THOSE
MULTIPLE SPINNERS?
We watched closely for the out- !
break of spinning dervishes in the 1
back alley of the Bronco team but j
found nothing but straight stuff. We 1
are struck with a big hunch that j
1 hi.'- multiple spinning stuff,is spun j
mainly for the edification of sports I
writers and photographers.
If Santa Clara ran California '
into the ground with those crazy |
end runs, the Bear ends must be
of an uncommonly poor variety.
Kaliski would never win any
prizes with the sprints lie showed
Saturday, and Sobrero looked like
a truck horse pounding away. We
could have forgiven Norgard and
Moscrip a few gains over their
positions after hearing how mar
veously effective were Sobrero,
Kaliski, and Saltino.
LAWSON'S COACHING
MADE GOOD ENDS?
Frankly, before this game we
were considerably apprehensive of
Stanford's outcome should the first
string ends be injured. But the
.•-bowing of Lyle Smith and Alex
Thomras, who replaced Norgard j
and Moscrip, relieved doubt in that i
quarter. Both of them were smack
ing down the interference with gus
to, while the halves were racing up
to make most of the tackles.
Which all brings out that yarn
about "Pop" Warner wherein it is
stated that he merely told his ends
to charge in and bust things up. !
A good share of Stanford's success- I
ful end play this year might be a J
result of Jim Lawson's coaching, j
llu; men are playing no straight j
charging stuff. They wait, they j
float, they sift, they ride it out, and |
generally just make it tough on the {
interference. A charging man, fast .
moving across the line of scrim
mage towards the play, is always
the easiest man to cut down.
Ami to return to the subject of
new men who showed especially
well Saturday, the giant Reynolds
who replaced injured Ben Pala
mountain did well in there. A
friend who played at guard in
his football days, once told us,
"Good ends make a line good.
Tiiey make the tackles look good
and they make the guards look '
good, too."
SOME GAMES OUGHT NOT
BE SCHEDULED
We groaned all through the ardu
ous job of sitting in the stadium
while the tiresome spectacle of the
Stanford frosh running through
Armstrong Business College went
on and on. Armstrong was clearly
out of its class and the frosh got
less practice than a good Wednes- I
day afternoon workout against the
fourth string. We know that Coach
Jimmy Bradshaw has the job of I
preparing for Southern California's
Trobabes next Saturday, but this
annual track meet could be spared
without anyone's feelings being j
hurt. —Hamilton |
