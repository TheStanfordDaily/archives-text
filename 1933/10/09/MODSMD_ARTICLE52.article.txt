# YEARLINGS' SPEED AND POWER ROUT BUSINESS SCHOOL
## 
### Charles Chappell 
When the last touchdown had been
! taliied and the final conversion ac- ;
| counted for by a corps of veteran j
I higher mathematicians last Saturday
i afternoon, it became apparent that
| Stanford's fast - traveling young j
| freshman grid team had walloped
; the inexperienced Armstrong Busi
ness College squad by a score of ,
some 56 points to nothing.
Since Armstrong's previous record
I is still veiled in mystery, the con
test proved little excf>pt that Coach
Jimmie Bradshaw has a number ot
backs who are very adept at cross
ing the goal line standing up. The
game served its purpose, however,
j by acting as an easy breather before |
! I tie sterner opposition of the S.C.
I Trobabes next Saturday.
Turretto Scores
Vigna began the field day by tak
ing the opening kick-off and out
sprinting all eleven of Armstrong's j
entrants in a 70-yard dash that fi
nally ended deep in the visitors' j
territory. Turretto carried the ball
over from the 8-yard line and Wil
liams converted.
The Stanford shift caught the
Armstrong boys on the wrong
side of the ball a number of times
Saturday, resulting in several pen
alties, the lirst two of which
helped put the Babes in scoring
position again. Vigna carried the
ball over from the 15-yard line to
bring the score to a total of 13
early in the second quarter.
Getting possession of the bail on
the 50-yard line after Armstrong's
return of the kick-off, Stanford's
heavy scoring guns again swung into
action. Brent made eight yards and
the ball then went to Ledbetter who
crashed through center, caromed a
few troublesome opposing backs out
of his way and galloped 42 yards to
another score. Williams converted.
Visitors Fumble
With Beedle recovering a fumble
on the Armstrong 22-yard line and
Joe Vigna circling left end. to an
other touchdown, the count stood
27 to 0 as the half ended, with Wil
liams again adding the extra point.
Resuming the touchdown trek
as the second half opened, Led- i
better tossed a pass to Schouteau
that was good for some 25 yards, i
Rolls, a substitute halfback,
rounded right end for the fifth
tally and Williams repeated the
monotonous process of booting the
hall through the cross bars for
the extra point.
The next score came via the
blocked punt route, for which urac
tically the whole Stanford line was
responsible, although Williamson |
alone grabbed the ball out of the air
and ran it across from the 20-yard
line. Williams did his usual bit to j
make it 41 to 0.
Voigt Tallies
A process that involved kicking- i
off to Armstrong, recovering the
ball on the 26-yard line, and then
giving it to Voigt to carry to the
two-yard marker, from where Led- i
better pushed it over, was respon
sible for the seventh score. Wil
liams failed to add the extra point
this time.
Another blocked punt, recovered
by Schouteau on the 10-yard line,
gave Voight a chance to pyramid the
score up to 53 to which Schott added
the extra point. With Armstrong
trying to punt out from behind their
own goal line, the whole Stanford
team swarmed in and added a safety
just for good measure, ending the
debacle at the 56-point mark.
