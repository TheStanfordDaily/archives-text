# MONDAY DEFEATED IN GOLF TOURNEY BY MERCED PRO
## 
### Bill Newman 
With Stanford's double threat
eliminated from the contest, Bennie
Coltrin, Lake Merced professional,
defeated Rod Monday, fighting Santa
Rosa instructor, by just the margin
that their previous experience in
large tournaments represents. Mon
day, after overcoming the strenuous
i opposition of Mark Fry, the tourna
! ment medalist, was tense and light
| through the entire game. Coltrin,
on the other hand, played brilliantly,
| giving little quarter to his fdhner
caddy.
In the morning Coltrin shot even
par 35-36 71 to down on the eigh
teenth hole. Rallying brilliantly in
the afternoon he held Coltrin rven,
j succumbing on the thirtieth hole.
Coltrin's edge in the morning was
provided by his expert putting and
his steady iron play. On the first
nine of the first eighteen Coltrin
| used but fourteen putts, while the
1 hard trying Monday needed nine
teen. Coltrin used eighteen on the
I second nine while Monday steadied
i down to sixteen. In the afternoon
up to the thirtieth hole Coltrin used
| twenty-five as did Monday.
Stanford stars Hawley and Traut
man met in the feature match of
Ihe quarter finals. The issue was
| finally decided on the nineteenth
I hole when Hawley, after sinking a
long putt to tie on the eighteenth,
won when Trautman over - ap
proached the gi'een.
| Monday defeated Fry; De Massey
defeated Clare Griswold, Merced
, amateur, and champ Coltrin de
feated Peiper, San Jose Simon pure.
