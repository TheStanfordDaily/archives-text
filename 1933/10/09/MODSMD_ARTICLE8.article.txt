# Resurrection Of Rugby Seen By New Zealander
## 
### 
Incredulous and inquisitive about
the resurrection of the 15-year-old
corpse of rugby, the New Zealand
Rugby Union sent to Stanford's old
maestro, Harry Maloney, an inspec
tor and authority, sailing him some
four thousand miles for a week's
stay on this coast.
Having seen the resurrected once
again a living thing, Mr. Newman,
New Zealand Rugby Union repre
sentative, declared rugby enough
revived to endure a sea voyage to
New Zealand and Australia this
coming year with Stanford rugby
men embodied in the team. Plans
will be given completeness with
Newman's return this wec\ from
Vancouver.
A team composed of Stanford
rugbyites will leave for Honolulu
immediately after final examina
tions here on .June 13, according to
tentative plans. From the island
port -the squad is to swing down to
Auckland, New Zealand, for its first
games with the college teams of
New Zealand and Australia.
The occasion for such a brief
long-distance voyage was the amaz
ing belief of rugby enthusiasts that
the coast teams, which came to life
last year after dying out around
1918, could compctc on a level with
the skilled teams of the Australians.
The disbelief of life - long players
could but. be overcome by evidence
such as Maloney could offer in the
lorm of his stars of last year's cham
pionship team. Introducing to New
man these men: Ben Palamoun
| tain, Johnny Reisner, Bill Sim,
Chuck White, and Bob Grayson,
Coach Maloney showed some of
the aces in the deck and may win
for his team the all-summer rugby
tour for 1934 in New Zealand and
Australia where Stanford men will
play fellow students in the south
ern universities.
