Strikes of agricultural workers
.spread up and down the state. From
Lodi to Bakersfield bitter, mobbing
growers and embittered, mobbed
pickers were embroiled, broiling.
Stale Labor Commissioner Mac-
Donald, who evidently doesn't be
lieve (strange fellow) that strikers
are anarchists, communists, social- j
ists, and Mafia-men, all rolled into \
one, said his say.
Spake the commissioner: "If a lit- j
110 judgment is used, the situation !
should quiet down, but if the grow- j
ers continue in their attitude of de- |
fiance and advocation of force a j
most serious situation threatens, j
There is an honorable and fair way j
to deal with the situation." Mean- ;
while the unfair way was rolled J
out. Clubbed strikers, evicted men j
and women, were taking to clubs ,
themselves. Parades for strikers in j
Kern grew noisy, unruly; cautious, j
regular deputies slapped noisier, I
more unrly paraders behind bars. |
Grasping, griped growers planned !
''drastic action." If State law does
not come (local law seems generally j
paralyzed for non-grower use) the
piospect of night-riding, Lodi-like
niobbings, general mess and disorder
comes nearer to the whole central
vi-lley of our "golden" state. Lynch
Law California is on the horizon, if
not under the nose.
