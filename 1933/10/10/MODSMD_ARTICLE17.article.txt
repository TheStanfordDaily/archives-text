# MORE WOMEN CAUSE HOUSE GREEKS GRIEF
## Nine Sororities Have Room For Forty Additional New Members 
### 
Stanford's sorority problem, al
ready serious because of' crowded
houses, becomes more acute this
year with the 300 additional coeds.
The situation, calculated with unof
ficial figures checked by the Daily
lest night, is this:
In round numbers, the nine houses
can accommodate 40 more girls
while 40 is also the total number of
sorority graduates for the coming
year. Last year each of the nine
houses took in from nine to 15
pledges. Striking 12 as the average
number of pledges per society a
total of 108. If the same number are
rushed this year they must live in
quarters planned for 80 girlsâ€”the
number graduating plus the possible
accommodations now available.
For the tabular-minded check
up shows the following: (All fig

instances, merely estimates given
by house managers.)
Possibilities for expansion exist
at Chi Omega where rooming facili
ties for 10 more members whs re
ported; Tri Delta, room for 8-10
more; Alpha Phi, G-8; Alpha Omi
cron Pi, 6; and Delta Gamma, 1-5.
Delta Gamma leads in the num
ber of seniors with IB potential
graduates while Alpha Omicron
Pi and Alpha Phi each have (I;
Kappa Alpha Theta, 8; Kappa
Kappa Gamma, 7: and Tri Delta, 3.
Several societies reported in
creases in membership. Chi Omega
jumped from 13 last year to 23 this
year. Gamma Phi Beta, refusing to
talk because "I'm sorry, it's against
the house rules," is also known to
have increased. Delta Gamma is the
third growing sorority this
a membership of 31 against the 28
of last year.
