# House-Breaker Steals Equipment from Chi Psis
## 
### 
While the campus Greeks still
mourned the loss of considerable
coin contributed to an unknown
gentleman last Thursday night, the
secluded Chi Psi house mourned
the loss of a radio and a bevy of
tennis rackets to a more daring
though less successful vandal.
According to the investigation by
Curdy Davis, campus officer, the
bold one entered the house through
the front door at about 1 o'clock. As
cending the stairs, he looted the
men's rooms.
Though still trying hard, Stan
ford and U. of C. police have found
no further trace of the robber.
