### 
What seventeen collegiates from
Bay district universities think of
life is contained in special article,
"Young America Speaks Its Mind,"
written for the San Francisco Ex
aminer by Harriet Beckwith.
The following Stanford leaders
were interviewed:
Jeanne Millard, A.W.S. president
said in reply as to how the depres
sion had affected campus life, "Stu
dents don't go to city dances nearly
as often. The girls have taken up
bicycle riding, skating, and walking."
Slonakcr Speaks
Echoing her sentiment, Marion
Slonaker, Theta president, stated in
part, "Before we used to think we
couldn't go to a show unless boy
friend took us. Now a bunch of us
girls go together, sit in the cheapest
seats and find out we can have just
as much fun without any menâ€”and
sometimes better.
"You see a lot of girls in the house'
sewing and knitting. They never
used to but they don't have nny
thing else to do."
Vice-president of Pan-Hellcnic,
Phyllis Doane, said, "I don't think

campus women are interested in
outside affairs at all. They don't
even read the daily newspapers, only
the college paper. What they talk
about?is college scandal, footbaJ, and
chit chat."
An entirely different view was
ti ken by Ellamae Dodds, Daily night
editor, who said. "I think Stanford
students are interested in outside
affairs. More people are taking eco
nomic courses. And last spring dur
ing the bank holiday the students
go to professors out of class
and ask questions about it."
Abe Melinkoff, Daily editor, pre
dicts a Fascism of some sort if NRA
fails. He said that the campus is
essentially conservative and decried
the important place of football in
campus life.
"Football is the key interest on
the campus and I think it's a big
mistake. It. curtails interest in real
education,"
Bill Corbus. AU-American guard,
was another Stanford leader inter
viewed. He felt optimistic about the
future but doubted if the NRA can
accomplish all it sets out to do.
