Train Chartered
Special S.P. train has been char
tered; round trip fares at only 510.25

Despite cynical disbelief: No boat
goes down; Friday night's student
iron horse expects a goodly throng
and has promised decorations and a

I nu-nt.
Small initial sale notwithstand
ing, campus questionnaire by the
pep-inspiring group points to an
unprecedented migration to the
Southern metropolis. Armistice Day,
November 11, Saturday is the date.
Place: Los Angeles Memorial Sta

pinnacle in the memory of the pres
ent college generation.
Cheap Rates
