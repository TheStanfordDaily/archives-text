# New Guard Placed Over Cellar Cigar Counter

### 
With the innovation of the new
womep, the old Stanford student
finds the campus considerably
changed. With women walking up
and down the law steps, and bobbie
socks appearing on Quad, it be
comes merely one of those inevitable
facts that even the Cellar is no
longer the same, for it sports a new
folding grille to push across the
smoke counter.
The explanation, as offered by
Miss Christine Ricker, direcior of
dining halls, ends bewilderment. It
was erected in order that the smoke
counter may be closed before the
soda fountain; and the north en
trance to the Cellar may still be
used. Formerly, when the smoke
counter closed, it was necessary to
only the south entrance. The
piille was installed in June, and
used during the summer months.
