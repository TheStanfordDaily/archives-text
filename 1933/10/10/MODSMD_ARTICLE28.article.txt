### 
Paintings of William Silva, a land
scape artist of international repu
tation, are on exhibition at the Stan
ford Art Gallery this month.
Mr. Silva's paintings have won
many prizes, both in America and
Pfcris, during che last twenty years.
He received the Landscape Prize of
the California State Fair at Sacra
mento in 1920 and 1921. Mr. Silva
came to Carmel from the low coun
try of Georgia and Carolina, and
the settings for most of his pictures
are in the South and West. The
New York Herald, Paris edition, says
of his work: "His frequent use of
s .ft and delicate tones is protected
against mere prcttiness of effect by
the vigor and precision of his draw
ing."
"Jessamine Time," "Summer Sun
et, Carmel," and "Light on the
Wnter, Lobos," are three of the
paintings exhibited. The pictures
wili be shown until November 5.
