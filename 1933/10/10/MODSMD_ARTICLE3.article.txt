### 
Tammany, already in a bad hole,
sank still further into the mire after
the receipt of the latest rumor con
cerning the forthcoming New York
mayorality campaign. Defections of
district leaders and their underlings,
important cogs id the usually well
oiled Tiger machine, have increased
by leaps and bounds. So much so,
that the odds now favor lantern
jawed John Patrick O'Brien to run
third in the three-cornered race.
Cause for this unprecedented cir
cumstance lies in the poor showing
of the mayor in the primaries.

the wilderness, graft-ridden Tam
many now seeks smiling, jovial Al
Smith, landlord of the Empire State

to accept, country's No. 2 Democrat
would ensure almost certain vic
tory. Meanwhile, Tiger chieftans
continue to bounce ungrateful
henchmen who have deserted to the
McKee camp.
