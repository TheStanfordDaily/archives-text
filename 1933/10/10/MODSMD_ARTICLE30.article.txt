Pioneering in an interesting ex
perience to the new women who
form the first two undergraduate
off-campus living groups in Stanford
history. There are nine women at
Castelleja School and 15 more liv
ing at Miss Harker's.
They don't mind the inconven-
I ience of transportation and have no
intention of foregoing campus ac
tivities because they live in Palo
Alto.
"The spirit in our group is really
splendid," praised Hazel Reynolds,
graduate student who is acting as
head resident at Harker's. "We have
been represented 100 per cent at all
events so far."
The living quarters for these
groups are ideally situated, each
separate from the school. The Stan
ford women have the use of the
swimming pool and the tennis
j courts. The Harker group plans a
! swimming party Sunday night.
