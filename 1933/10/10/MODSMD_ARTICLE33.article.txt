This weekend the campus will have not one, but two
all-t niversilv dances. That is phenomenal and pleasing.
II is the l»es1 realization of the "Hack to the Farm" idea.
The social life must be recentered on the Campus. The
depression lias made weekend splurges a rare luxury, in
deed. People stay here because Ihev can't go any place
else.
The depression having thus played into the hands of
Ihe students, it behooves us to make the most of what
might seem a misfortune. If we must stay on the Campus,
why not make it exceedingly enjoyable? And what more
fun than tripping Ihe light fantastic with these 1 7f>o
""queens" and at a reasonable fee?
doing to the city (for social reasons) •vs not only ex
pensive but is somewhat foolish as well. The hotels in
San Francisco are like the hotels in Los Angeles, Portland,
and not 100 different from those in Des Moines. There is
quite a span of years after graduation and before rheuma
tism completely overcomes you. During that time, Ihe
city hotels are yours for the cover charge.
Hut now we are at Stanford. Now is the only time we
can dance under those steel beams at the Women's (iym.
Now is the only time we can even liope to dance in that
beautiful Dance Studio. (Sometimes, when Dr. Dyment
so wills, we can enter the sacred portals.)
In short, il is the old line—we are young but once. We
are at Stanford only once. We should squeeze this Stan
ford orange. Get everything out including the seeds!
Support these Campus dances and those that are to
follow. No middle-aged business men with their blondes
lo step on at these dances. You step on nothing but Stan
ford students.
For years we pleaded and begged for a "Hack to the
Farm" movement. And now il is here. This editorial is
dedicated to our dreams of the pas! and lo our dreams
realized Campus dances.
