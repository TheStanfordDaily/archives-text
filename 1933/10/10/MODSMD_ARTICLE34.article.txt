Stanford traditions, like the G.A.R., fnst are dying out,

ened. Yesterday were seen half a dozen new students (we

Before nianv days, examinations will he on tap and
the Honor Code, the Farm's most famous and practical
tradition, will get its first workout of the new year. "Let
the Winds of Freedom Blow," seal motto, does not issue

shoulders.

teeth, hello, you should go back to the hushes. T. L.
