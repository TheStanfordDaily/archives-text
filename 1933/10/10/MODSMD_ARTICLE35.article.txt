# Alone at Last

II is almost a tradition thai the Daily should occasion
ally disagree with tlit' metropolitan newspapers. Usually
we disapprove of only one or two of them at a time. Now
there is an issue about which we think most Stanford stu
dents will agree that the policy of most of the newspapers
of California is unethical and foolish.
Concerning the present wave of labor agitation and
strikes, the papers of the state have adopted an attitude of
horror. Amazed, the editors indicate that they think it is
practically treasonable that a worker should demand more
than thirty-live cents an hour for working with his hands
under the hot sun.
Now, the Daily has no rabid policy regarding capital
ism. If it is doomed we have not been conclusively fore
warned. Mut we do think that if chaos is possible, it will
come as a result of the actions of narrow capitalists rather
than of communists. The American people are not likely
to revolt if they are given a minimum of comfort.
Most Stanford students are capitalists (as the numer
ous automobiles and trips to the city indicate) and they
should be sympathetic with the struggles of the working
class, for both selfish and unselfish reasons. R. M.
