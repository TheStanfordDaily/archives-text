PENTHOUSE CMGM) at the
Stanford Theatre
''Penthouse" is an average pro
gram picture. Concocted from a
glamourous gangland background, a
bit of mystery, a sturdy hero who
knows riot fear, and a lovely lady
who knows not love (but plenty
about passion), the picture offers
good returns on your quarter, pro
vided you don't care for tho radio.
Warner Baxter, a falling star,
ripples the muscles of his face to
the proper effect, but it is Myrna
Loy, looking more like a little kit
ten than ever, who provides the
interest in the picture. Cast in a
heroine's role, requiring her to
use lines which caused Manager
George Teckemeyer to put a
warning "Essentially adult enter
tainment" before his theatre. Miss
Loy displayed, not the ability of
an actress, but qualities which
seem to assure her stardom soon.
In the supporting cast, Nat Pendle
ton as the gangster chieftain offered
the best performance in a typical
"pal of the hero" part, which neces
sarily demands a pathetic death in
the last reel. Philips Holmes looks
End acts like Charles Butter worth.
Butterworth as the stock comic gen
tleman's gentleman isn't very funny,
and Mae Clarke, too infrequently
seen, is murdered before her second
close-up.
"The Pied Piper," Disney's suc
cessor to "Three Little Pigs," es
tablishes conclusively the place of
the nursery rhyme in adult life,
and promises high quality in fu
ture cartoon shorts.

ALICE IN WONDERLAND
Presented by Dorothea John
son at the Palo Alto Community
Theatre
To the stage Alice in Wonderland
is a Brobdignagian task because of
twe difficulties: that of dramatizing
a rambling tale of sense and non
sense, and that of constructing prac
tical sets and costumes which will

satisfy the predetermined and sub
limated conceptions of the audience,
Alice Gerstenberg's adaptation
was admirable; Fred Stover's sets
and the John Carter Fork masks
were unbelievably ingenious and
effective. Much more imaginative
than and infinitely superior to last
'.rear's Travers production, even
this dramatic version loses much
of the book's charm, a loss prob
ably inevitable in attempting to
translate a classic into another lit
erary medium. Probably Alice
herself withstands the change best
and Olivia de Havilland made her
young, very charming, very vola
tile.
Of the players unhampered by
masks, the Red and White Queens
and Mad Hatter were the most
amusing. Dorothea Johnston espe
cially realized the possibilities of
caricature in the White Queen, and
her characterization was more sub
tle than those of various other ac
tors, who must have viewed their
roles as mere Land of Oz creations.
Many of the players, completely
encased in costume and mask, had
to rely for expression entirely on
voice and posture; in some cases
the result was monotony of in
tonation and slowness of move
ment. Of all the characters the
Gryphon used his costume to the
best advantage; his scene with
Alice and the Mock Turtle was
one of the funniest in the play.
Very wisely the whole theatre was
used for the action, including
aisles, side-exits, and orchestra
pit.
The play, never smooth and well
polished, was occasionally actually
rcugh, because of masks, forgotten
lines, or slow cues. But carping at
lack of polish in anything as spon
taneous as Alice in Wonderland i.s as
foolish as the inevitable disappoint
ment that Dormouse was not stuffed
into the teapot or that the Cheshire
grin did not appear without the cat.
