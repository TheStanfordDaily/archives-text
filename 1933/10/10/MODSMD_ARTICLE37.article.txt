FUN WITH THE PEDAGOGUES

Professional humorists find the
I modern college an easy subject for
j native. They write laughingly and
| sneeringly about courses in Lace-
Making, Horsemanship, and The
History of Flowers and Their Mean
ing.
I suppose that the wits are try
ing to indicate that college isn't very
practical. They seem to gloat over
their theory that college students
are wasting four years studying use
less things. Like many members of
i the older generation, they receive
a tremendous pleasure from figur
i ing that university students will re
ceive a slap in the face from the
j world when they graduate.
So because they enjoy thinking
of college students as immature and
impractical, and because they realize
: that their readers like to be told
that a university education is not
worth-while (for people who read
1 present-day popular humorists gen
! orally haven't been to college), the
| professional wits continue to poke
| their so-called humor at the col
j leges.
They are at their best when they
can write satirically that the College
curriculum is composed of such
courses as Early Renaissance Etch
ers, Hotel Keeping, and The Social
Life of the Minor Sixteenth Cen
tury Poets. They describe extra
i curricular activities equally dis-
I nally, referring to perhaps the Banjo
i Club as the chief student activity.
One such writer described the de
bating club as meeting once a
mcnth in the dark and arguing, Re
solved, "That Archeology has done
I mc re to brighten human life than

! Palaeontology."
II is true that some of the courses
i ottered even at Stanford are not
highly practical, or even mildly '
likely to make students wealthy and j
famous. But what has evidently j
not occurred to the humorist is that i
the impractical courses are not so ;
ridiculous. A class in modern i
drama, even in swimming, is likely j
to give a student a life-long inter- .
est and be a source of perpetual I
satisfaction. What more can be
asked?
The so-called practical courses —
economics, engineering, etc.—prob
ably on the whole do less to pro
mote the welfare and happiness of j
college graduates than do the |
courses which arouse sneers. For ,
every student who acquires lasting ;
benefit from say geology, dozens !
will get good from a course in dra
; matic literature.
It is better to let students take
courses which are impractical and (
which lead to an interest in life, J
j than to force them to take the sup- I
I potedly practical subjects. Latin and
Greek used to be requirements be- j
cause it was thought that thinking j
about Latin and Greek developed
the brain. Now psychologists tell us
this isn't true. Besides, people who J
enjoy Latin and Greek are as rare
as a college professor who can chin :
himself. If the present generation j
of students is allowed to study sub- :
jects of interest, a few college |
I graduates of the future may have
an interest in something beside ]
money making, and bridge, pi ize-
I fights, and golf. —Rolph Malloch

I suppose that the wits are try
ing to indicate that college isn't very
practical. They seem to gloat over
their theory that college students
are wasting four years studying use
less things. Like many members of
i the older generation, they receive
a tremendous pleasure from figur
i ing that university students will re
ceive a slap in the face from the
j world when they graduate.
So because they enjoy thinking
of college students as immature and
impractical, and because they realize
: that their readers like to be told
that a university education is not
worth-while (for people who read
1 present-day popular humorists gen
! orally haven't been to college), the
| professional wits continue to poke
| their so-called humor at the col
j leges.
They are at their best when they
can write satirically that the College
curriculum is composed of such
courses as Early Renaissance Etch
ers, Hotel Keeping, and The Social
Life of the Minor Sixteenth Cen
tury Poets. They describe extra
i curricular activities equally dis-
I nally, referring to perhaps the Banjo
i Club as the chief student activity.
One such writer described the de
bating club as meeting once a
mcnth in the dark and arguing, Re
solved, "That Archeology has done
I mc re to brighten human life than

! Palaeontology."
II is true that some of the courses
i ottered even at Stanford are not
highly practical, or even mildly '
likely to make students wealthy and j
famous. But what has evidently j
not occurred to the humorist is that i
the impractical courses are not so ;
ridiculous. A class in modern i
drama, even in swimming, is likely j
to give a student a life-long inter- .
est and be a source of perpetual I
satisfaction. What more can be
asked?
The so-called practical courses —
economics, engineering, etc.—prob
ably on the whole do less to pro
mote the welfare and happiness of j
college graduates than do the |
courses which arouse sneers. For ,
every student who acquires lasting ;
benefit from say geology, dozens !
will get good from a course in dra
; matic literature.
It is better to let students take
courses which are impractical and (
which lead to an interest in life, J
j than to force them to take the sup- I
I potedly practical subjects. Latin and
Greek used to be requirements be- j
cause it was thought that thinking j
about Latin and Greek developed
the brain. Now psychologists tell us
this isn't true. Besides, people who J
enjoy Latin and Greek are as rare
as a college professor who can chin :
himself. If the present generation j
of students is allowed to study sub- :
jects of interest, a few college |
I graduates of the future may have
an interest in something beside ]
money making, and bridge, pi ize-
I fights, and golf. —Rolph Malloch
