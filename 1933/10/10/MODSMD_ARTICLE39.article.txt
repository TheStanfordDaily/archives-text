## THORNHILL, MASTERS PLAY REVERSED ROLES 
### 
Alter hearing the results of North
western's first game of the season,
which they lost 7-0 to lowa, Stan
lord's Coach Tiny Thornhill felt re
lieved; Stanford's graduate rnana
ger, A1 Masters, embarrassed.
INiorthwestern by reason of dropping
the game to a comparatively weak
team caused the Indian coaching
stall' no alarm, but it did not estab
lish the Wildcat team as a Class-A
box office attraction.
Luckily, Masters had no such wor
ries last week. Reason: Northwest
ern was idle, playing no game. But
this time it's Thornhill's turn to be
come nervous.
No one knows how much im
provement Dick Hanley's men can
make in two weeks, with the advan
tage of meeting no team in the in
terim. The Northwestern coach fa
vors the Warner system, as you'll
probably know if you have seen one
of his fast teams play in the annual
Shrine East-West mill. And the
Warner system, claim its defenders
and critics both, require time to ob
tain good execution.
