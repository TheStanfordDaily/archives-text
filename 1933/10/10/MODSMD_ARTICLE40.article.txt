# THE
						QUESTION OF FOOTBALL VACATIONS
## 
### 
Just how much value is a Satur
day afternoon's rest for a team?
The question is much argued. How
ard Jones apparently appreciates the
occasional vacation, as he has pre
scribed an afternoon of leisure \>ne
week before the Trojan-Indian con
test this year. Jones described the
13-0 victory wrested from Stanford
last year as the hardest game the
1932 S.C. team played, and he inti
mated that he expects the game
coming up to be similar.
The Broncos accepted a week's
layoff between their big games with
California and Stanford and found
thj combination -not to their liking.
