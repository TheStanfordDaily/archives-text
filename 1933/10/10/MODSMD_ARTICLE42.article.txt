# ST. MARY'S AND SOUTHERN METHODIST
## 
### 
There are rumors floating about
that St. Mary's might cancel their
game with Southern Methodist to
be played in December of this year
in order to schedule a game with
Stanford on that date.
To our belief this would be a most
deplorable condition. The attrac
tion of the Southern Methodist-St.
Mary's game is not the Gaels but
rather the pass-Hinging men from
the South, and it would be too bad
not to give the fans of the San Fran
cisco Bay region an opportunity to
see Coach Morrison's men. The
Moragans, to our mind, are not such
a stellar attraction from the specta
tors' point of view. They generally
play a drab, conservative game, and
wear down their opponents by sheer
power. The Stanford varsity can do
without the blue and red silk-panted
Gaels.
