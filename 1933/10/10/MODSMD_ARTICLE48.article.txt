# CARDS, TROJANS TIE FOR COAST CONFERENCE LEAD
## 
### BY FRANK TREMAINE 
Thundering over Washington
State with power reminiscent of ihe
day; of Morley Drury, Don Williams,
and Russ Saunders, Howard Jones'
Trojans, in their first 1933 confer
ence game, placed themselves in a
tie with Stanford for first place in
the Pacific Coast Conference, a po
sition from which it is hard to see
how they will be displaced.
The Cougars, before falling be
fore the Southern California on
slaught, 33 to 0, were rated as the
only conference team with a
chance to break U.S.C.'s winning
streak which has now been ex
tended to 25 consecutive games. It
now appears up to the unscored
on Cardinals or Navy Bill In
gram's Californians to displace
Troy as king pin of Western foot
ball.
Stanford, as a result of her vic
tory over U.C.L.A. a week ago, is
also in first place, following her
victory over Santa Clara Saturday
after the Broncos had kicked the
Bears two weeks previously, and is
rated as a menace to the Trojan
reign. California's defeat of St.
Mary's ruins the Gaels' chances for
their first national championship
hopes for which were running high
at the beginning of the season.
The Bears' victory makes them
also one of the most feared teams
on the Coast, bearing out the .state
ment made before the opening of
the season by Troy's Howard Jones
that he feared California more than
any other squad on the U.S.C.
schedule.
U.C.L.A.'s Bruins, after their de
feat at the hands of Stanford, re
versed their form to knock off Utah,
perennial Rocky Mountain cham
pions, 21 to 0 in a non-conference
game.
