# FROSH GRIDMEN POLISH ATTACK FOR S.C. BABES
## 
### 
Having conclusively demonstrated,
to ihe tune of some 56 points,.that
ihey can play football better than
the boys who attend Armstrong
Business College in Oakland, Stan
ford's high-scoring freshmen have
begun to work on an offense that
may or may not dazzle the none
too-gullible S.C. Babes next Sat
urday.
The main task then is to de
m lop a scoring attack that will
not only gain yardage but will
also result in a few much-needed
touchdowns. This is expected to
titkc* the form of a speedy run
ning attack and a few well-di
rected passes a la Sobrero style,
with Rusty Ledbetter plunging
through the line whenever a num
ber of fairly certain yards arc
needed.
Meeting a business college team
with little time or place for prac
tice and attempting to stop the con
sistently powerful Younger Trojans
are two tasks of an entirely differ
ent. nature, a fact that Coach Jimmie
Bradshaw and his freshman charges
are well aware of.
Routed last year by Stanford's
greatest frosh team, for which their
unusually weak squad was no
match, the Trobabes want no repe
tition of such a massacre and are
rumored to have plenty of big,
strong fellows well able to prevent
it. With one of the heaviest lines
that ever gladdened the heart of a
freshman coach at Stanford, how
ever, Bradshaw feels that his stal
warts can stave oft any threat that
may arise through that department.
Freshmen still trying vainly to
obtain handbooks may get them at
A.S.S.U. offices.
