Dispatches from Geneva indicate
that the World Disarmament Con
ference will be called for Monday
next as planned. Said Chairman
Henderson: "Any postponement will
lend weight to reports that the na
tions had no intention to bring forth
a genuine pact. Such a postpone
ment would result in suspicion.
What is required now are political
decisions."
Hope for some solution to the dis
armament problem was seen when
thief Reich Delegate Dr. Rudo'f Na
dclyn stated that his country de
sires an accord.
