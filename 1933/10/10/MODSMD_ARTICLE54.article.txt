# SYMPHONY GROUP WILL REORGANIZE UNDER NEW HEAD
## Tryoutees Meet Tonight In Women's Old Gym 
### 
Tonight marks the beginning of
the reorganization of the new, great- j
er and better Stanford Symphony I
orchestra, under the leadership of 1
its new director, William Fuhrmann.
Members and prospective-members
will meet in the old Women's Gym
I at 7:15 o'clock tonight.
Stanfordites who have played in
high school orchestras or had any
ether orchestral experience will be
taken in immediately as the mem
i Ijership is down at present and
I places are open for all interested
1 talent.
Fuhrmann conducted the last con- j
i cert of Spring quarter which was
j very well received. His program for J
| the first concert after the reorgani
zation of the symphony will be es
pecially .versatile and interesting. It
j will be rendered Thursday night, i
November 23, in the Palo Alto Com- i
munity Theatre.
According to present plans, con
certs will be given near the end of
each quarter. The course in orches
tra, or work in the symphony, rates 1
one unit of credit. Syllabus fee will ,
be nominal. Although not yet defi
nitely set, it will be substantially j
smaller than first announced.
Rehearsals begin at 7:15 o'clock. |
They will be held in the Old
Women's Gym. Students without
instruments, but intending to send ,
tor them later, should show up at j
rehearsals anyway.
Double bass, viola, oboe, and bas- '
soon are urgently needed. There is !
still some room for experienced vio- j
linists.
