# Triangular Sports Day Slated for November 4
## 
### 
Whether or not flooding the cam
pus with women has improved the
athletic standing of Stanford women,
may be discovered when Mills, Uni
versity of California, and Stanford
meet on November 4 at the gym at
Berkeley, for the annual Women's
Triangular Sports Day.
Competition includes five sports:
hockey, tennis, swimming, archery,
and golf. Having made a good rec
ord in swimming and tennis last
year, Stanford women hope to do
the same in hockey this year.
Lunch will be served for 50 cents
as a break in the all-day affair.
