# Union's Business Booms As 1300 Served Daily

i Eating has kept Miss Christine
! Ricker busily occupied since the
beginning of collcgc. Not lhat she
has had time to do much of it her
self, but as director of the campus
dining halls, she is concerned with
] the task of feeding Stanford's new
women and adjusting other eating
' places to the enlarged enrollment,
i One of the most encouraging re
sults of the greater registration t hi.s
j year is that business at the Cellar
; is going back to the 1931 level, Miss
| Bicker reports.
"The first week of college we
I served an average of 1,300 daily.
; But this docs not mean that all were
served meals," added she, indicating
i Stanford's traditional fondness for
|coffee and snails between classes.
Miss Ricker places the noon-time
I congestion in the Cellar on the ab-
Isence of the old cafeteria, now a
I dining hall for the Union unit, and
j urges graduate and off-campus
women to eat in the main dining
I room which is open to the public

[and offers a quiet place in which to
lunch.
The new women have proven a
be on to student employment, stated
'the Union director, who hides be
neath a pretty, gentle-voiced exte
i rior the efficient ability to control
the destinies of Encina, Roble, and
Union dining halls.
, "Instead of last year's 15, we now
hire 45 hashers, bus boys, and di.sh
! washers in the Union alone." She
.said there were much fewer women
'seeking hashing positions this year,
although the number of men look
ing for part time work had in
â–  creased.
Another sigh of returned pros
perity is that there are more fresh
' men eating at Encina than there
1 were last year.
Miss Ricker also said that the new
women had aided buying power in
the Union as it was necessary to
purchase additional china, linen,
glass and silverware for the din
ling hall.
