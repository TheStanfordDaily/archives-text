# Willis Fears Next Tremor
## California Nearing End Of Quiet Period 
### 
Stressing the need for a state- j
wide building code to protect Cali- i
fornians against earthquakes, Dr. j
Bailey Willis, Stanford seismologist, I
spoke in the first of the Tuesday j
evening lecture series at the As- I
scmbls' Ha'll last night. "
"California is near the end of her !
quiet period!" Dr. Willis warned.
"What the next quake may do to
our cities is horrible to contemplate.
The Inglewood, Santa Barbara, and
Long Beach tremors were helpful,
educational shocks that should have
taught us to adopt strict building
codes."
"New structures are being built j
earthquake proof. It is the old I
buildings that must be made safe. ;
This can be done by using steel j
bracings and by covering brick walls I
and loose tile with reinforced con- j
crete."
Dr. Willis pointed out that Palo j
Alto is one of the safest cities in j
the state. Careful building inspec
tion and the adoption of the "Long
Bcach code" were named as the rea
sons for the city's comparative free- .
dom from danger. The Stanford
buildings, however, were declared to
be unsafe.
Previously the seismologist had
explained how a 4,000-mile diameter
ball of molten iron is constantly
pushing disturbances to the surface :
in California. Only in Chile and |
Japan is this elastic quivering worse j
than in this state, he said.
