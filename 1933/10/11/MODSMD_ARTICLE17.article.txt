Sun-browned California slopes,
twilight in the swamps of Georgia,
Hawaiian valleys, grotesque postur
ings of nudes, and life-sized busts
of David Starr Jordan and Joaquin
Miller. . . .
These in brief form the subject
material of three new exhibitions
now on view in the Stanford Art
Gallery.
The display includes that of Wil
liam P. Silva of Carmel where oils
depict scenes of California and
Georgia. Gertrude Boyle Kanno has
a number' of crayons of the un
draped figure and several pieces of
sculpture which include busts of
Dr. Jordan, William Keith, old
time California landscape painter,
Henry Cowell, well-known com
poser, and others.
Also exhibiting in the Art Gal
lery is John O'Shea of Carmel
Highlands, whose oil paintings are
of a strong, spontaneous, modern
type. Among his 24 paintings are:
Taos Landscape, Tahitian Fish, Ha
waiian Landscape, and Oahu Hills.
