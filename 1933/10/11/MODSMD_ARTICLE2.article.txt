# Strike-Conscious Cal.
## 
### 
"Four killed and two dying" was
the toll in the state cotton strike
yesterday as things were quieting
down a little. Following the proud
cotton growers' absolute rejection of
mediation, "Sunny Jim" Rolph or
dered State Labor Commission Mac-
Donald to the strike area to settle
things. At the same time the gov
ernor refused to send unbiased mili
tia to quiet things down. Reason:
the local authorities figure that their
shoot-at-sight methods are working
quite well.
In the rest of the state, workers
are griped too. One thousand Sa
linas lettuce pickers and 400 S.F.
longshoremen yesterday walked out.
The longshoremen trouble may stop
15 ferry boats and all freight load
ing of ocean vessels. For these two
strikes mediation is expected soon.
