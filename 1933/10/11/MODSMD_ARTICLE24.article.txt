# INDIANS NEAR CHICAGO, PLAN FOR PRACTICE
## Stops in Nebraska Utilized By Tiny for Workouts; Lineup in Doubt 
### Oliver Johnston. Jr 
The Stanford varsity, scheduled to
reach the Windy City this morning,
will take its first workout of the
week in uniform today. Yesterday
they made 20-minute stops at
Cheyenne and Grand Island, Neb
where Tiny gave the boys exer
cises and ran them around the
depot.
Northwestern suffered a loss of
13 lettermen last year and Diek
Hanley has replaced his gap.s with
sophomores just as Thornhill did.
The guards and center in the Wild
cat line are second year men and
probably two of the starting backs
will be sophomores.
Five Sophs May Start
Thornhill may keep pace with
Hanley and start five of his sopho
mores. It is certain that Tiny will
start his giant sophomores, Callo
way and Reynolds at tackles. Pala
mountain's leg injury will probably
not keep him on the bench the
v/hole game. Monk Moscrip will be
the third second year man in the
starting line. The eastern scribes
will all be watching Monk and he
may cinch himself a berth on the
All-American team.

In the backfield, Grayson is al- j
most a sure starter. Reports re
ceived last night say that Thornhill
wired ahead to Chicago to have a j
brace made for Bones Hamilton's j
jaw. This may mean that Tiny is ;
intending to start his ace blocker.
If Hamilton is able to play it should
bolster up the Indian offense a great
deal.
There is a possibility that Alustiza
may start if Stanford is to receive j
the opening kick-off, Ito get the
team out of the hole. Alustiza's good j
kicking in the Santa Clara game i
has made him the key man in keep- I
ing the Indian goal line pure.
Grayson First Choice
Jack Hillman, last year's regular
fullback, may come in handy to re
lieve Grayson if the Indians are in j
a position to score. With the hard
hitting Hillman going in fresh it
may furnish just the needed punch.
With Moscrip and Norgard rush
ing Ollie Olsen, the best kicker in
the Big Ten, he may find trouble i
in getting his boots off. It is very
likely in fact that a blocked kick i
by an Indian end or a place kick
by Bill Corbus may bring home the
bacon to the Farm.

may furnish just the needed punch.
With Moscrip and Norgard rush
ing Ollie Olsen, the best kicker in
the Big Ten, he may find trouble i
in getting his boots off. It is very
likely in fact that a blocked kick i
by an Indian end or a place kick
by Bill Corbus may bring home the
bacon to the Farm.
The Stanford varsity, scheduled to
reach the Windy City this morning,
will take its first workout of the
week in uniform today. Yesterday
they made 20-minute stops at
Cheyenne and Grand Island, Neb
where Tiny gave the boys exer
cises and ran them around the
depot.
Northwestern suffered a loss of
13 lettermen last year and Diek
Hanley has replaced his gap.s with
sophomores just as Thornhill did.
The guards and center in the Wild
cat line are second year men and
probably two of the starting backs
will be sophomores.
Five Sophs May Start
Thornhill may keep pace with
Hanley and start five of his sopho
mores. It is certain that Tiny will
start his giant sophomores, Callo
way and Reynolds at tackles. Pala
mountain's leg injury will probably
not keep him on the bench the
v/hole game. Monk Moscrip will be
the third second year man in the
starting line. The eastern scribes
will all be watching Monk and he
may cinch himself a berth on the
All-American team.

In the backfield, Grayson is al- j
most a sure starter. Reports re
ceived last night say that Thornhill
wired ahead to Chicago to have a j
brace made for Bones Hamilton's j
jaw. This may mean that Tiny is ;
intending to start his ace blocker.
If Hamilton is able to play it should
bolster up the Indian offense a great
deal.
There is a possibility that Alustiza
may start if Stanford is to receive j
the opening kick-off, Ito get the
team out of the hole. Alustiza's good j
kicking in the Santa Clara game i
has made him the key man in keep- I
ing the Indian goal line pure.
Grayson First Choice
Jack Hillman, last year's regular
fullback, may come in handy to re
lieve Grayson if the Indians are in j
a position to score. With the hard
hitting Hillman going in fresh it
may furnish just the needed punch.
With Moscrip and Norgard rush
ing Ollie Olsen, the best kicker in
the Big Ten, he may find trouble i
in getting his boots off. It is very
likely in fact that a blocked kick i
by an Indian end or a place kick
by Bill Corbus may bring home the
bacon to the Farm.
