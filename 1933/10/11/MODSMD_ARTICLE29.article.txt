### 
Train-dancing!
Such is the novel feature which
Espee wiil provide in each of the
special L.A.-bound, student-carry

sored the idea, and further stipu
lates that the dance-cars will be
chair less, decorated in cardinal and
white, provided with a Stanford or
chestra, and waxed as to the floors.
Questionnaires which flowed back
to the Red-capped pep-inspirers
showed campus enthusiasm to be at
a high pitch. Yet students held

2,000 called for by the "On to Troy"
drive.

avoid the almost inevitable last min
ute rush, early purchase is urged
by those in charge.

sold to date. This encounter takes
place November 25 in the Stanford
stadium. Contrary to previous an
