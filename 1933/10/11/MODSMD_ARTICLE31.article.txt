# '37 Coeds Demand Beer In Return for Pick-up
## 
### 
The new women have a way of
making traditions of their own. The
latest is as follows: "It shall be tra
ditional for a Stanford man, when
, ho has been given a ride to the cam
! pus by unknown young women, to
treat her to a glass of beer."
It started when two new women,
1937 edition, in a shining green
roadster picked up a couple of
roughs awaiting a lift to the cam
pus. But they didn't go to the cam
pus. It was a lovely night, there
1 w;i: a full moon, and the women
wanted to know, "DO you know
i where we can get some good beer?"
