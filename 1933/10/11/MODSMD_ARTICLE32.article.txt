(Editor's note: This is the first of a i
series of three articles to he run,
viewing the opinions of Stanford
professors and others on the subject
of Germany's "blacklisted books.')
Considerable attention has recent
ly been drawn to the display of
books which have been censored by
German authorities, now on exhibit
just outside the Hoover War Li
bit. ry.
The list includes such volumes as
Ernest Hemingway's "Men Without |
Women"; Thomas Mann's "Von
Deutscher Repubiik ; Karl Lieb
knecht's "Voices of Revolt' ; Ernest
Toller's "The Machine Wrecker,"
and Erich Maria Remarque's "All
Quiet on the Western Front."
Professor Edwin A. Cottrell ex
pressed his opinion on the black
listed books as "an attempt on the
part of Germany to destroy the war
guilt placed on her by the Treaty
of Versailles." Any book which

I blames Germany it is natural for
them to destroy, he continued.
"I think it is one of the most use
less things imaginable," Cottrell
said in giving his opinion of the
censorship. "The actual burning of
books reached only a few thousands
(if volumes in Berlin, amounting to
merely a gesture," he concluded as
he explained how people carefully
hid these books as treasured posses
! .sions.
Professor Graham Stuart says, "I
'can see why both Hemingway's and
Remarque's books should be black
listed. The latter damns both mili
tarism and war; and Germany's re
covery program propounds force as
a possible necessity." In the case of
Hemingway's books," lie said, "it is
probably that his form of culture
goes contrary the Nazi principles."
"I myself object to censorship of
any sort because it results in just
the opposite of what is attempted."
Sluart continued.
