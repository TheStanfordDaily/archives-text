# FORMER FARM GRIDMAN FOILS AIR DEATH TRY
## Alleged Bad Check Passer's Attempted Plane Crash Disclosed by Burns PILOT BALKS SUICIDE Airman's Determined Skill Saves Both Lives 
### 
What yesterday appeared to
spectators as a plane stunting over
the ba.v marshes was revealed to
day as a life and death battle be
tween two men for the control of
an earth bound plane, one of
them planning suicide.
The occupants were dark, prepos
sessing Damon Wilson, former Stan
ford student and bogus check art
its de-luxe, and former varsity end
Johnny Preston, whose greater skill
thwarted the mad attempt.
Crash Planned
Arrested yesterday at the Palo
Alto airport, arid brought to Stan
ford for questioning in connection
with bad paper passed at the Union,
Wilson confessed his entire plans
when Officer Burns asked the rea
son for his presence at the airport.
Surrounded by difficulties and fac
ing disclosure, Wilson admitted his
plan to hire a plane, crash it and
fade out. When asked whether the
fact that he could not get a plane
alone affected his plans he answered
a laconic "No."
Airport officials told of Wilson
coming to the airport early yester
day and asking for a plane to go up
solo. Being unable to show the
necessary student pilot permit, Pres
ton was assigned to go up with him
and test his ability to handle a ship.
Alter an hour Might, lie landed.
Preston told him he thought be
needed more training. Wilson
looked dejected and asked that he
be given a quarter hour's further
trial. Preston consented and then
the wild ride began. Taking the
air, the desperate Wilson headed
for the open marshes bordering
the bay about two miles below
Mayfield. There the rotten check
artist threw the plane into a fast
spin from which Preston had dif
ficulty in leveling it. The blonde,
husky, former end's sheer deter
mination was the only thing that
prevented that frenzied dive from
ending in a burning pyre.
Thinking that the lack of expe
rience of the man in the other cock
pit was responsible for the dive and
not a twisted mind, Preston re
turned the control to Wilson as soon
as he brought the machine to a
greater altitude.
Another Attempt
On the way back to the airport
Wilson said that he attempted an
other dive but was prevented by
the prompt action of Preston. Fi
nally in despair as the plane glided
down toward a smooth landing, Wil
son kicked the rudder savgely,
causing the plane to side-slip sud
denly toward the field lights. Pres
ton quickly threw the slick toward
the other side, righting the plane
again. When they landed in Palo
Alto police were waiting.
When questioned, Preston said
that he attributed the plane's be
havior to his co-pilot's fear and lack
of experience. The thought of a sui
cide attempt was the farthest thing
from his mind. Wilson went to
Stanford for the fall and spring
quarters of 1927 and 1928.

fact that he could not get a plane
alone affected his plans he answered
a laconic "No."
Airport officials told of Wilson
coming to the airport early yester
day and asking for a plane to go up
solo. Being unable to show the
necessary student pilot permit, Pres
ton was assigned to go up with him
and test his ability to handle a ship.
Alter an hour Might, lie landed.
Preston told him he thought be
needed more training. Wilson
looked dejected and asked that he
be given a quarter hour's further
trial. Preston consented and then
the wild ride began. Taking the
air, the desperate Wilson headed
for the open marshes bordering
the bay about two miles below
Mayfield. There the rotten check
artist threw the plane into a fast
spin from which Preston had dif
ficulty in leveling it. The blonde,
husky, former end's sheer deter
mination was the only thing that
prevented that frenzied dive from
ending in a burning pyre.
Thinking that the lack of expe
rience of the man in the other cock
pit was responsible for the dive and
not a twisted mind, Preston re
turned the control to Wilson as soon
as he brought the machine to a
greater altitude.
Another Attempt
On the way back to the airport
Wilson said that he attempted an
other dive but was prevented by
the prompt action of Preston. Fi
nally in despair as the plane glided
down toward a smooth landing, Wil
son kicked the rudder savgely,
causing the plane to side-slip sud
denly toward the field lights. Pres
ton quickly threw the slick toward
the other side, righting the plane
again. When they landed in Palo
Alto police were waiting.
When questioned, Preston said
that he attributed the plane's be
havior to his co-pilot's fear and lack
of experience. The thought of a sui
cide attempt was the farthest thing
from his mind. Wilson went to
Stanford for the fall and spring
quarters of 1927 and 1928.
What yesterday appeared to
spectators as a plane stunting over
the ba.v marshes was revealed to
day as a life and death battle be
tween two men for the control of
an earth bound plane, one of
them planning suicide.
The occupants were dark, prepos
sessing Damon Wilson, former Stan
ford student and bogus check art
its de-luxe, and former varsity end
Johnny Preston, whose greater skill
thwarted the mad attempt.
Crash Planned
Arrested yesterday at the Palo
Alto airport, arid brought to Stan
ford for questioning in connection
with bad paper passed at the Union,
Wilson confessed his entire plans
when Officer Burns asked the rea
son for his presence at the airport.
Surrounded by difficulties and fac
ing disclosure, Wilson admitted his
plan to hire a plane, crash it and
fade out. When asked whether the
fact that he could not get a plane
alone affected his plans he answered
a laconic "No."
