# Mr. Arthur Henderson, Disarmament Conference, Geneva
## 
### 
You are to bo president of a disarmament conference
that will not disarm anybody. You also will have the dis
tinction of heading the conference at a time when, above
nil other times, disarmament is necessary.

It is vital that we disarm at present for two reasons:
lirst, the financial burden on the people is fast driving a
bankrupt world to financial chaos. Second, the nations of
the world as at no other time since the war are at each
others' throats like so many bulldogs. Some even say the
dogs of war are already barking in the "wings"—anxiously
waiting their "call."
All sense points toward disarmament. Hut yet everyone
is sure that the disarmament conference will go the way
of the London conference—only more so. The paradox is
irritating. And we youngsters in college can only lay the
whole mess on the already well - blackened'doorsteps of
our elders. The utter damn-foolishness of our elders (and
presumably our betters) becomes increasingly annoying.
Mr. Henderson, why not make your conference differ
ent? Why not start out with a condemning blaze that you
admit what you already know: The conference will be a
dud. In the past, it has been the custom to make the dud
as sweet-smelling as possible. The dud has been cloaked
with glittering hopes and flowery phrases.
Why not be different? Why not make your dud ugly,
black, and stinking? In short, reveal it for what it is. Let
the peoples know that the diplomats have failed. Let them
know that, in the face of world calamity, they have con
tinued to toy with antiquated "words" and official-sound
ing "formulas."
Why not lay the blame where it belongs? Why not lay
the blame squarely on the jingoists in every country? Why
not lay it particularly 011 those countries where the jingo
ists have complete control—Germany and Italy?
Then, why not suggest some commonscnse measures
that can be taken to end this mad race of competitive
armaments? Why waste time on such idle suggestions as
more "peace-loving" people and understanding among the
peo pie of the world? It is obvious that no nation can dis
arm in the midst of armed neighbors. Recognize these
things and proceed further.
Suggest taking the profit out of armaments. Prohibit
Ihe shipment of arms to other nations. Of course, the na
tions will refuse to accept such proposals for such things
would lead to just what they are trying so hard to avoid
disarmament.
Yes, Mr. Henderson, we do not expect disarmament
from Geneva. Hut it would be pleasingly startling to find
frankness. For the utter foolishness (some say damn
foolishness) of these conferences is painful.
