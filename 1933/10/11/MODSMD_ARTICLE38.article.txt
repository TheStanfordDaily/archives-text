Siii<l nil Kncina Ilall inmate to the janitor: "When will
I hey turn on the heat in this place?"
Said the janitor to the Kncina Mall inmate: "Some
sunny afternoon when it's hotter than blazes around here."
Which sums up the current temperature situation in
the old dormitory, where studying efficiency and general
health is being somewhat impaired these nights because
the radiators have been as cold as a landlord's heart.
In addition to putting the Encinamen in poor fettle to
attend their K o'clocks, adding to the student health bureau
visitations and preventing the students from getting off
to that swell start, the cold menace opens the way for pos
sible worse trouble, epidemics, whatnots.
And so, in the name of health and welfare, can the Kn
cina radiators be made to wheeze forth before some
sunny afternoon?
