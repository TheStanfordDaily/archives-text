AIMEE $EMPLE McPHERSON:
AN AMERICAN SUCCESS
Back in '18 and '19 when indus
trial giants were beating down la
bor, and laughing, and making mil
lions, American Business confined
itself to businesses. The Fuller
Brush Man had not yet become a
household pest; your best friend
didn't hesitate to tell you, and MEN
still walked a Mile for a Camel. But
then got busy the royalty of big
business, the toothpick kings, the
liver pill queens, the "corn-off"
czars. Advertising became blatant;
the radio was ready to co-operate;
the millions rolled in, and AMERI
CAN BUSINESS (now in capitals)
was part and parcel of everything
American.
The temptation was too great for
Sister Aimee. Already a soul-saver,
she set up shop in the largest farm
town in the world, Los Angeles;
announced Bargain BaptismaLs and
soul cures. Hand on the Bible, eyes
on the collection plate, Aimee start
ed things out auspiciously.
Taking Wrigley's advice to "Tell
'Em Quick and Tell 'Em Often," the
good sister rapidly put the gospel on
a paying basis. Aimee was a wow!
Adam Smith's famous preachment
came to her naturally. Inside of ten
years she has been able to turn her
back on the cotton growers and em
brace the silken negligee, desert the
big top platform for the towering
Four Square edifice in the City of
Angels (which name never deceived
Sister Aimee)., and start a chain of
little "four squares" all over the

| country.
It is a matter of considerable
question whether soul-saving or
money has been the dominating fac
tor in Aimee's career. As a soul
saver she is a success: after all, no
one can judge accurately when an
other's soul is safe and satisfied. My
soul may call, even bellow, for soft
organ music to keep it on the high
road. The tuneful souls of Tom,
Dick, and Henrietta may cry for the
blatant saxaphone, honking out a
sacred hymn to the tune of "Honey,
Are You Making Any Money" to at
tain absolute contentment. Aimee's
customers (for such they are) seem
satisfied with the commodity they
are purchasing. That is their only
test.
As a business woman, Aimee Sem
ple McPherson Hutton is literally a
howling .success. The evidence is
bountiful.
Thus, a success in both of her
chosen fields, soul-saving and busi
ness, she ranks as the captain of an
i American industry. Each individual
• success by itself could be admired.
Together they are impalpable. To
many like myself, a hash, composed
of finely chopped bible and nice
flaky bank book, well seasoned with
jtzz and ballyhoo, is a highly indi
gestible breakfast cereal.
Perhaps those who exclaim: "I
can't get anything out of religion"
are lacking, not in spirituality, but
in simple business acumen.
