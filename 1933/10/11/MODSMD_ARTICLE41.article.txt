AMERICAN COMPOSERS ON
AMERICAN MUSIC: Edited by
Henry Cowell. (Stanford Uni
versity Press, 1933)
Much has been written about
American music, but usually by pro
fessional critics and commentators
who were on the outside looking in.
Henry Cowell has constructed his
book on the theory that only mu
sic-makers themselves are capable
of rendering competent opinions on
the subject. Thus, every contribu
tor to the symposium is a composer
in his own right.
The first part of the book i.s de
voted to reviews of specific com
posers and their works, with some
attempts at critical evaluation. The
second discusses general tendencies.
The main fault of the work is that
it is not a balanced picture of con
temporary music, being far too
prejudiced in favor of the radicals.
One misses some of the more con
servative' names—John Alden Car
penter, Daniel Gregory Mason, Leo
Sowerby, Abram Chasins, and
Douglas Moore.
Notwithstanding, the book is
clear, and forms a valuable addition
to the literature of music, for ac
curate information about our radi
cal development in the field is far
too scarce. Many of the composers
themselves were surprisingly able
writers, and one feels that they
know what they are talking about.
It is not a work for the general
reader, as there is much technical
discussion which presupposes a
knowledge of musical theory; but
for the musician interested in a clear
and lucid account of the extremists
anci what they are trying to accom
plish, Mr. Cowell',s book is the best
yet to appear.

; dance. His company, young and
, promising, offered a varied and
highly individualistic program. Al
though they do not all dance in the
same pattern, it is obvious that they
have learned grace of arms and
hands from Ito, sometimes, it must
be admitted, to the extent of ne
glecting the rest of the body. Many
of the dances were merely rapid
series of lovely arm postures. Beau
tiful costumes and simple but ef
fective lighting helped.
Unfortunately the music in
truded too often and asserted it
self as a tlicme to be interpreted
by the dances rather than as an
accompaniment for them. Wigman
successfully does away with mu
sic; Kreutzberg subdues it to
mere accompaniment; Ito barely
subjugates it to a place of sec
ondary importance.
The evening's interesting range of
colorful moods ran from the touch
ing dignity of Lotus Land to the
snake-like sensuousness of Legenda
Morisca. Traditional, experimental,
Oriental, Arabian, Cuban, Greek,
Orpheum Circuit, and tone poems
were mixed. By far the most grip
ping dance was the dramatic Nuit
Blanche of Warren Crosby, whose
fierce intensity fired the clear confi-
I dent movements of a handsome phy
sique. His Greek and Dance -Arabe
were fresh and sharply accurate.
Waldeen, small and graceful, was
lovely in Salutation to Beethoven,
and her personal charm was incom
parable in the highly original and
literally intoxicating Juba Dance.
