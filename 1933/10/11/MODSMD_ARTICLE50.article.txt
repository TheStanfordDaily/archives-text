# SIDELINE SLANTS..
## THE
						GRIEVANCE COMMITTEE IS KNOCKING AT THE DOOR 
### 
The football team is up in arms
against this department. Rather,
what is left of the fool ball team
alter 34 players have gone to Chi
cago. It seems that these hulking
tackles, these fleet-footed halfbacks,
these barrel-chested fullbacks of the
fourth and fifth string thai are left
on the Farm held a meeting of the
grievance committee the other day.
The subject matter under dis
cussion was a passing remark in
(his (olnmn wherein it was de
clared that Stanford ends have
iorsaken the crashing game.
The grievance committee decided
that being a sports writer, or
pseudo-sports writer, your corre
spondent as a natural consequence
was dumb. And that further, he
was inexcusably blind, thus initi
mating that thick-headedness was
excusable, there being no hope for
a sports writer anyway.
Our innate dignity forbids us to
say as harsh words concerning the
fourth string. We know several of
them personally, a few more by
name only, and a good many by
/reputation, and we can heartily
vouch for them. They are not at
all blind.
But probably we are wrong any
way, although from what we saw
of Iho Santa Clara game we still in
sist that the Stanford ends were not
playing a strictly charging game,
For the moment, apologies to the
discerning fourth string. When End-
Coach Lawson gets back from Chi
cago, we intend to run this charging
end canard to the earth.
