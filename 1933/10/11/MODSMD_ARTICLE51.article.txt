# SOBRERO IS GOOD BUT WINS NO HAT
## 
### 
As time gives us a clearer per
spective of the Card-Bronco game,
the thing that stood out seems to
u& to be the playing of Sobrero of
tiie Santa Clarans. Tiny Thornhill
says of Sobrero that he does not ex
pect to see his like again on the
Coast this year.
Harry Maloney, director of mi
nor sports, who has viewed many
a game of American and rugby
football, thought Sobrero's work
the best lie had ever seen.
Naming the outstanding player of
1 lie bay region last Saturday, one
group of writers picked Jack Brit
tingham, California's new end, over
Bobby Grayson of Stanford. The
honor may as well have gone to
Sobrero.
