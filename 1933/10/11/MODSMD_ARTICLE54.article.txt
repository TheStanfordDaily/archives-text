# Little Shoots Par to Lead Golfers
## DON EDWARDS AND JACK HOERNER IN TIE FOB SECOND 
### 
Stanford's semi-finalist in that
i greatest of all golf tournaments, the
! national amateur, has again asserted
his supremacy. Risking his number
one courtesy position and qualify-
I ing with the rest of the team, Law
! son Little put together a 74 and a
71 to take the lead position. Little's
! first nine holes of qualifying were
| a poor 41, but ho came back on the
! second nine with a 33. His second
| round was even par.
Sensational and unprecedented
was blonde Don Edward's first day
! score of 69 â€”two under perfect fig
ures. Less sensational but more con
sistent was last year's University
Champioiship Finalist, Jack Hoerner,
who tied Edward's grand total of
147. Don's second round was a
sloppy 78. Hoerner has a 72-75. They
will playoff for No. 2 man honors.
Dick Gid (lings Fifth
Steady Jack Greer pounded out
an aggregate of 148 to step into the
number lour position. Diek Giddings
and Morse Erskine have the fifth
and sixth positions well in hand, re
spectively.
Perhaps the greatest improvement
on the new and replenished 1933-34
team is Jim Moser, who htis brought
himself from a shaky No. 12 last
year to an undisputed No. 7.
Bob Thompson's splendid first
round of 37 was dimmed by an 83
which dimmed his threat to the
leaders. He will play No. 8. Pacific-
Coast inter - collegiate champion j
Gene Brown and Bill Shepherd, a
new man from Los Angeles Wil
shire Club, will play-off for the
ninth position. They are tied with
157 apiece.
Dwyer, Hoelle Tie
Last year's men Tom Dwyer and
Bill Hoelle have slipped into a
deadlock for the eleventh berth.
Their scores were 158's. The rest
of the team is as follows: Edmonds,
Cox, Sophian, Dan Moser, Pearson,
De Brettville, Nicholas, and Munro.
' In speaking of this year's edition
of Card golfers, Coach Eddie Twiggs
l'ated Hoerner as the most improved
golfer of the upper six. He said
that Hoerner has improved all his
shots and presents a threat in any
tournament. Scores generally were
high, but held well when compared
with previous fall demonstrations.
Due to mud-fight injuries the Frosh
have been given until Thursday to
complete their rounds.
