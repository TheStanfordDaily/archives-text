# REYNOLDS REPORTS FOR PRACTICE AS FRESHMEN PREPARE FOR S.C.
## 
### 
With Kiski-trained Jim Reynolds,
big and adept at golf, football and
track, ready for possible service at
end, Coach Jimmie Bradshaw con
tinued last night to drill his Trojan
conscious freshmen in the intrica
cies of penetrating the stubborn S.C.
defense. AJso coming in for its share
of the attention was the task of
stopping the familiar, steam-roller
I ke, Southern California scoring at
tack.
Injured early in the season, Rey
nolds, former running-mate of the
much-publicized Moscrip, went to
Los Angeles for treatment to his
knee, reappeared recently, and is
ready to see how his leg holds up
under the gridiron strain. In any
case he will make the trip South,
giving Bi'adshaw a quota of five
capable ends for vise in the Coli
seum Saturday.
Goc on the defense, Stanford's
fresh. ,en will need a full measure
of such stubborn resistance when
they meet the powerful Trojans.
Chief scoring threat of the S.C.

! all-Southern California fullback,
and a dangerous line-plunger. Not
satisfied with Keller alone, S.C. also
lias Paul Wing, second-string all-
Southern California fullback, now
playing quarter and alternating at
i the ball-carrying task.
The Trobabe record includes a
tie with the powerful Santa Ana
J.C. team, a decisive victory over
Compton J.C., undefeated by S.C.
since 1929, and a last-Saturday win
from Chaffee Junior College. Al
though also boasting a capable line,
I the Trobabes will probably encoun
-1 Ler plenty of trouble with Stanford's
heavy young forwards.
Men chosen by Bradshaw to go
South include: endsâ€”Schott, Jen
kins, Elder, Chouteau, and Reynolds;
tackles: Beedle, Williamson, Tsout
souvas, and Taylor; guards: Hurley,
Spinnetti, Waldon, Cottrell, and Gi
son; centers: Bergman and Quails;
backs: Brent, Turretto, Vigna, Rolls,
Williams, Ledbetter, Reed, and
Voigt.
i frosh seems to be Theron Keller,
