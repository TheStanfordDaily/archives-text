# Popular Public Term, Says La Piere of NRA
## 
### 
First it was the ''New Era," then
the "Depression," next the "New
Deal," most recently the N.R.A.,
which stood as the most popular
public terms of the day, according
to Professor La Piere, sociologist.
Recently his class was told, "I will
not attempt to discuss the N.R.A.
or America's future, knowing even
less about them than President
Rooseveltâ€”or below the irreducable
minimum," by slight, fair, Professor
La Piere.
