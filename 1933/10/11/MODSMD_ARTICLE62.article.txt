## 
### 
The years of depression have
I made the Stanford rough more
j health-conscious than ever before,
i according to figures released by Dr.
Thomas Storey, director of the Stu
; dent Health .Service. Last year saw
17.356 men making use of the Serv
ice compared to 15,655 in 1931 and
| 10,761 in 1930. These are voluntary
I calls.
The Health Service examined 117
i food handlers on the campus and
issued the necessary certificate of
j clean health, arranged for 148 to
have special consulations, referred
151 men to private physicians, sent
22 to dentists and 114 cases to hos
pitals, and 119 were taken to rest
1 homes for short stays.
