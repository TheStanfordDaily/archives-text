## Money Is Declared Lacking For Band's Trip To Southern Game 
### 
Scheduled for last night at 7
| o'clock, the ASSU ex committee
meeting began on the dot at 7:28
o clock. Late, breathless, President
Trautman had gone to Roble jolly
up to inspect the new crop.

[ executive order dispensing with the
Ice Cream Rule (late arrivals at ex
committee meets to buy ice cream
cones for the assembled legisla
tors).
At the suggestion of Roble In
spector Trautman, half a dozen
week-end dates were closed, pend
ing ASSU decision to hold dances
on these nights.
Sacred Room
Despite protests by genial, tennis
playing Chuck Otis, it was decided
that only the Men's and Women's
Councils and the' Ex Committee
cculd meet in the Ex Committee
room. This eliminates the Rally
Committee and other rabble, but
executive order may permit any
group to meet in the sacred place.
Peace Money Voted
Twenty-five dollars was voted
for the purpose of stopping the next
war, through the agency of the Stu
dent Institute of Pacific Relations.
One hundred dollars was voted to
the Glee Club for music.
The usual mandatory gift to the
Dramatic Council was raised from
$600 to $1,600, provided that the
Dramatic Council is to give its Im
provement Fund (totalling $25) to
the Associated Students.
Band Tabled
Since the B.A.C. can't afford to
send the band to the U.S.C. game
this year, the Ex Committee con
sidered the proposition, found it
could afford to send only two mem
bers of the band. The motion was
tabled until next week.
Hablcs Sacrifices
Small, wiry, smooth-talking Stu
dent Manager Les Hablcs offered to
donate $70 from his $80 salary to
cover the loss on a vacation-time,
ASSU-sponsored, edition of the
Daily. Quizzically, Editor Melinkoff
asked if Hables would hold another
manager in a similar position. Ha
bles said he wouldn't. The Ex Com
mittee finally refused to accept
Hables' magnanimous gesture.

Band Tabled
Since the B.A.C. can't afford to
send the band to the U.S.C. game
this year, the Ex Committee con
sidered the proposition, found it
could afford to send only two mem
bers of the band. The motion was
tabled until next week.
Hablcs Sacrifices
Small, wiry, smooth-talking Stu
dent Manager Les Hablcs offered to
donate $70 from his $80 salary to
cover the loss on a vacation-time,
ASSU-sponsored, edition of the
Daily. Quizzically, Editor Melinkoff
asked if Hables would hold another
manager in a similar position. Ha
bles said he wouldn't. The Ex Com
mittee finally refused to accept
Hables' magnanimous gesture.
