"WHEN A FELLER
NEEDS A FRIEND"
. . . depend on good old Briggs!
Cramming is a pleasure —if it's cramming
mellow old BRIGGS into your pipe!
What a grand tobacco BRIGGS is —bet-
ter than many tobaccos costing twice
as much!
BRIGGS is aged in the wood for years.
There is not a bite in a barrel of it. No
wonder that in a few short months it be
came a nation-wide favorite before it had
a line of advertising! But won't you let
BRIGGS speak for itself, in your own pipe?
ItRIG.GS Pipe Mixture is also gold in 1-pound and
'j-pound tins . . . nnd in 1-pound Humidor Kegs.
