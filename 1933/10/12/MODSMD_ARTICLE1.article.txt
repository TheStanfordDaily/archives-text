## from The Associated Press On the Strike Front 
### 
All was comparatively quiet on
the national strike front yesterday,
but California's cotton troubles re
mained as serious as ever. Glad
handing Jimmy Rolph once more
asserted himself, this time notifying
local authorities that they would be
responsible for all miscarriages of
justice; arbitration, twice-rebuffed,
was again preferred.
Flitting from one stand to another
His Excellency lit on still another,
this time a firmer one. Said he:
"Unless the parties involved submit
these disputes to arbitration and
and abide by the results, 1 will then
have to take some other definite
stand." But California's 50 million
dollar cotton crop is still unpicked;
bands of strikers still shuttle be
tween Visalia and Tulare, trouble
centers.
Things look bad in Pennsylvania,
are getting closer to National Labor
Board arbitration and settlement. In
the Pittsburgh steel district, out
spoken, determined Mrs. Pinchot
was still trying to find a place to
address strikers. Die-hard, com
pany-owned towns are finding more
and more flimsy pretexts for ex- j
eluding her.
