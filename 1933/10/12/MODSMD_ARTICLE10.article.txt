# Wilbur Plans Forum Series
## Continuation of Gatherings Planned for '33-'34 
### 
Last year at Wilbur-invitation,
seme 20 representative students hit
the little-frequented road to the
Presidential manse. At a meeting,
barred to the press, was conducted
an informal discussion on Univer
sity problems. Result: pleased stu
dents; pleased President; favorable
comment generally.
Yesterday, into the heavy quiet
of the Presidential office, walked a
representative of the Daily (not one
of the 20 representative students) to
inquire whether such conferences
would be continued. They will.
Graduates remember with a kind
glow the weekly meetings of long
time Stanford President, David Starr
Jordan. Wilbur's will not be of the
same kind. He will be more organ
ized, less exciting, more productive
of concrete results.
Thf Presidential plan calls for a
series of some six or more meetings
throughout this and the following
quarter. At each meeting will be
students interested in some phase of
student life. Examples: Men's and
V''men's Councils, clubmen, frater
nity men, student governors.
"And the athletic crowd if we
have room," added Wilbur, show
ing thus complete impartiality with
all groups as well as a recognition
of the vast interest there.
''And publications?" swelled the
Daily man. That they too shall have
their evening was assured. The
President is interested to know what
they think of the University. Sus
pecting irony, he was asked if he
objected 1o being referred to in the
Daily as "tall and lanky." The Pres
ident did not object.
