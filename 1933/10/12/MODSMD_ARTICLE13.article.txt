When asked his opinion of the
movement, Judge Jackson H. Ral-
I .ston, Palo Alto citizen who spent
I six weeks in Germany this summer,
said, "I think it is one of the fool-

I ish things nations and people do
sometimes. I call it childish. I don't
think any nation is justified in de
fying free speech and press." He
went on to explain that the books
, are pacifist in nature, and that Hit
ler won't tolerate pacifist doctrines.
Professor Edward M. Hulme ex
pressed the opinion that the books
in question "are not of much impor
tance to educated people." However,
he said, "I am opposed to all cen
; scrship. I think that the best way
to expose the error of fallacious
thought is to let it speak out and
then by voice and pen point out to
tho public its mistaken character."
Walter Thompson, professor of
Political Science said, "My opinion
is that they are crazy." He said he
didn't think that the books would
I hurt the Nazi movement. "How
over," he concluded, "It's a fine
thing for the library to do to put
the books on display and stimulate
I reading."
Professor H. M. Cloakie expressed
a similar opinion.
In tomorrow's paper the German
.point of view will be given.
