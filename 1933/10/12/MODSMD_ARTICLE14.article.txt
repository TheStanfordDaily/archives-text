# Sorority Chiefs Air Views on Rushing
## 
### 
"Nineteen thirty-four rushing" from the view point of sorority women
provides problems, benefits, and experiments never before seen in the
history of Stanford womanhood. Rushing chairmen from eight houses—
the ninth could give no statement to the press—reported their opinion of
the situation caused by the entrance of some 100 new women. Their com
ments follow:
Lorine Anderson, Chi Omega: "I think the admission of the new women
will benefit sororities. I don't believe good sorority material will be left
out because each house will prob-#in, under the rushing rules, but I
ably take in a larger group than I feel that more contacts with new

usual. Stanford shouldn't have more
than nine sororities unless the num
ber of women goes far above its
present mark."
Jeanette Gould, Delta Gamma: "I
think the Pan-Hellenic rules arc
inadequate to the present situation
and will have to be changed. The
sororities won't have time to get ac
quainted with all the new women. I
think many women will be left out
for lack of more frequent rushing
contacts with sororities."
Betty Jane Hedden, Pi Beta Phi:
"I rather regret the present situa
tion for there are so many attractive j
new women and the sorority hous
ing facilities are so limited that only
a very small proportion of new
women will have an opportunity to i
affiliate."
Martha Hoerr, Delta Delta Delta: j
"Changed conditions demand new
rules. The increased number of j
women means a ti'end toward nor- !
malcy in sorority organizations. It |
will be favorable to all."
Barbara Roberts, Kappa Kappa
Gamma: "I think that the sororities |
have an advantage this year. We;
will be able to get acquainted with
as many women as we are interested i

women should be legal during fall
quarter. One way oyt of the prob
lems caused by an increased enroll
ment of women would be to enlarge
the sorority houses. This, I think,
would be desirable."
Esther Pickering, Kappa Alpha
Theta: "This year rushing will be
more difficult for both the sorority
and the new women. Last year the
new women had an opportunity to
meet all of the sorority women at
the fall teas. I think the situation
will be especially hard on the junior
transfers as there are so many fresh
men. I don't believe larger houses
are the answer to the problem.
Twenty-five or thirty are the most
that the houses can hold now, and
unless new sororities are established,
only a small proportion of women
will be in the houses."
Helen Born, Alpha Omricon Pi: "I
think the Pan-Hellenic rules are as
adequate as any could be under the
system of deferred rushing."
Dorothy Wehe, Alpha Phi: "Since
the rules are the best we can have
this year, rushing will be difficult.
More sororities would be nice, for
as it is, many eligible women, espe
cially junior transfers, may be over
looked."
