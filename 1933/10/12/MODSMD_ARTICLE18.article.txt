# U.S.C. Tickets Selling Poorly
## 
### 
Only 200 students have as yet
1 taken advantage of the $10.25 return
price on the Southern Pacific spe
cial train to Los Angeles for the
U.S.C. game on Armistice Day.
Student leaders want to make a
more unified contingent to the Tro
| jan stronghold for the 1933 contest
, than has been the case in past years.
ZTcr this reason, students who make
the train trip with the team, and
stay with members of the squad at
the Lankershim Hotel, will be given
i particularly attractive rates.
An unusually entertaining pro
gram of dancing has been arranged
i for the train trip both ways.
