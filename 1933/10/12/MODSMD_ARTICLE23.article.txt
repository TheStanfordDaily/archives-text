# Loss of Key Privileges Faces Negligent Women
## 
### 
Scattered abroad is an astounding
number of keys to various campus
sorority houses, discovered Women's
Conference Monday afternoon, one
house alone having lost 11 last year.
This disclosure may lead to Ihe
abandonment of the present system
by which each sorority woman pos
sesses a key to her own house, and
necessitate the return of the old
system of sitting up for the late
leavers.
Elm Cottage, Mariposa Hall, and
Madrono residents are now required
to report at the Union Residence to
obtain the wherewithal to get ki
after 10:30 o'clock, and keys must
be returned to the Union.
