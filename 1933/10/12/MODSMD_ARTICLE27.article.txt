# Bats in Encina Belfry, Reports Crazed Inmate
## 
### 
Encina Hall, Stanford's leading
bug-house, has gone totally batty.
Th ese little beast-like birds or
bird-like beasts may frequently
be seen fluttering about the halls.
Woodrow Lomas, Encina resi
dent, states that he has been
aroused from slumbers several
times during the past week to
drive the tiny beasts from his
face. Ted Leidig, another En
cina resident, vouches that he is
training the wee birds to eat
from his hand. All those present
ing student body cards will be
admitted to the exhibit, others,
he says, will be forced to pay a
25-cent admission.
