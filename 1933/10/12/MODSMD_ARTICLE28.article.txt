## Directors of Activities Tell About Organizations 
### 
Never before has the fact that a
new deal has come to the Farm been
more forcefully brought to bear
than at the all-University assembly
held yesterday morning. It was the
same "Come Join the Band" but
wilh a new pep; a new enthusiasm
that had never been felt before was
there. Sophisticated student body
leaders described the tradition, aids
and activities of Stanford life.
Designating the honor code as the
principal Stanford tradition, Student
Body President and Assembly Chair
man Jerry Trautman urged stu
dents observe it as a part of their
irdividual responsibility in Stanford
life. A.W.S. President Jeanne Mil
lard asked for a new deal for women
on the campus and pleaded that the
"SOO" be placed en an equal basis
with the men in campus activities.
Debate Representative Bromley
K. Smith assured that the women
will have an equal status at least as
far as debating is concerned, his
group having planned a series of
woman's contests.
Di.'ilv Editor Mellinkoff spoke of
the campus publications and urged
that the new student come out for
student publications as a quick way
to become a prominent factor in
campus life.
Bill Morse, student committee
chairman, told the assembled stu
dents that it was his groups' duties
to help smooth out the rough spots
and problems of campus life. When
troubled see a student committee
man.
