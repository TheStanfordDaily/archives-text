# Disarm, Not Rearm
## 
### 
Disarmament bargaining continued
apace at Geneva. Through Chief
Delegate Sir John Simond, England
said, no rearmament of Germany is
to be tolerated during the first stage
of any arms convention which might
be drawn up. French delegates,
mindful of forthcoming economic
parleys with Germany, reassured by
Great Britain's reaffirmation of her
responsibilities concerning peace on
the Khine, and conciliated by the
German acceptance of the principle
that France's heavy armaments will
be maintained for some years to
come, were hopeful that an accord
on the German "arms equality"
question could be reached.
Norman H. Davis took the middle
ground that a convention must be
freely negotiated. He attempted in
vain to obtain from Germany a
written outline of military needs for
her projected conscript army of
20C,000 men.
Said a British delegate: "This is a
disarmament conference, not a re
armament conference."
Timely note: Mrs. Koosevelt cele
brated her first White House birth
day yesterday.
