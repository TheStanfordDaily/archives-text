### Algaroos 
From his yellow, gleaming light
of Chappie's office came the voice <>f
chuckling, eagle-beaked, ruddy
faced, red-haired James Nelson Al
gal', editorial power of Chaparral.
Said he: "It's a pushover. Best yet.
Nothing can stop U. S."' He re
ferred to Stanford's Chaparral,
bulky, witty, feature-laden, comic
magazine, oldest in West, long up
holder of Farm's grandest tradi
tions. Further he stated: "No home
should be without this harbinger
of good, lasting, clean, much-wanted,
long-awaited cheer."
Said Robert William do Roos,
baggy-eyed, large mouthed, sallow
skinned business business depart

inent tycoon, supplementing Old
Boy Algar's remarks: "Chaparral, as
scheduled, will be here today. No
longer must anxious students fear
delay; Stanford's Chaparral will be
here" Added he: "Talking in this
timely way is more fun than read
ing number one news magazine, red
covered, weekly Time (no rival of
Chappie). " Hoped he: "You like it."
Biting no dogs, Leslie Irvin Ha
bles, thin, wiry, business-like, much
injured clean of student managers
made news. Said he: Nothing.
Still popular Chappie's price drop
will be evident today. Quoted
Thomas Hal O'dell, circulation man
ager: "One year's subscription, one
dollar; single copy, 15 cents."
