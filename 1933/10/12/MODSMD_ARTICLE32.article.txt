# HANLEY WORKS ON PASSES FOR INDIAN BATTLE
## Northwestern Mentor Fears Heavy Stanford Line In Coming Game INDIANS RUN SIGNALS Five Wildcat Sophomores To Start Saturday 
### Spud Hamilton 
Dick lianley, coach of (he
i Northwestern Wildcats who are
1 meeting Stanford Saturday in the
first great intersectional game
of the 1933 season, is afruid of the
heavy Stanford line. lianley
wound up his scrimmage for this
week yesterday with a heavy pass
ing attack as the outstanding part
of the practice session.
j The Northwestern mentor must
I have spent some time regarding the
statistics of the Santa Clara-Stan
| ford game. Looking at the cold fig—
I ures it does seem that Stanford has
j a powerful defense on the ground,
i and is weak in the air defensive
! game.
No Great Passer
Only one thing will prevent Han
ley's working of the passing game
against Stanford as well as Santa
Clara —Han ley has no passer the
equal of Sobrero. Hanley has de
clared that he will start Chuck Du
vall, his ablest passer, at fullback,
relegating the hitherto regular,
I Chilly Sutton, to the reserves. The
: long-kicking hack, Olson, popularly
I described as a greater man at the
| punting art than young "Diamond
j Joe" of the Broncos, will start the
I game at quarterback.
I Thornhill and his 34 players along
I with the rest of the coaching and
i training staff arrived safely in Chi
i cago yesterday and promptly went
Ito try the turf in Soldier's Field,
j scene of many brilliant intersec-
I tional battles.
'3(i Men to Start
Hanley has announced that live of
hir sophomore men will start against
the Cardinals, and in the event that
right-half Bob Hamilton is in good
condition and has found a protec
| tive brace for his injured jaw,
! Thornhill may match Hanley with
j five sophomores of his own.
j However, it is unlikely that the
pounding Indian half will be in such
I condition as to warrant his start -
I ing over Kenny Al'fierbaugh, who
I can carry the mail himself.
With his two key positions of
I right and left tackle, his left end,
i and his fullback certain to lie
I sophomores, Thornhill will present
! plenty of green material in the
[starting line-up.

Clara —Han ley has no passer the
equal of Sobrero. Hanley has de
clared that he will start Chuck Du
vall, his ablest passer, at fullback,
relegating the hitherto regular,
I Chilly Sutton, to the reserves. The
: long-kicking hack, Olson, popularly
I described as a greater man at the
| punting art than young "Diamond
j Joe" of the Broncos, will start the
I game at quarterback.
I Thornhill and his 34 players along
I with the rest of the coaching and
i training staff arrived safely in Chi
i cago yesterday and promptly went
Ito try the turf in Soldier's Field,
j scene of many brilliant intersec-
I tional battles.
'3(i Men to Start
Hanley has announced that live of
hir sophomore men will start against
the Cardinals, and in the event that
right-half Bob Hamilton is in good
condition and has found a protec
| tive brace for his injured jaw,
! Thornhill may match Hanley with
j five sophomores of his own.
j However, it is unlikely that the
pounding Indian half will be in such
I condition as to warrant his start -
I ing over Kenny Al'fierbaugh, who
I can carry the mail himself.
With his two key positions of
I right and left tackle, his left end,
i and his fullback certain to lie
I sophomores, Thornhill will present
! plenty of green material in the
[starting line-up.
