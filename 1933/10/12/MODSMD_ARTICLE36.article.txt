Marvic Ivalin has met with ilio various living-group
sporls managers. Plans are being prepared for the coming]
year of intra-mural sporls. II is our hope that the plans'
are more vigorous and extensive than ever before.
One of the most desirable forms of student activity on j
I lie campus is the intra-mural athletic contests. These I
are games played by people who lay 110 claim to being!
experts. In fact, the experts (the varsity men) are specifi- j
callv excluded.
Tliev are games played by men for the pure fun of the I
game. They get nothing out of the sport they may enter
except fun and exercise. Xo heroes these intra-muralers.!
No crowds watch them. Xo letters do tliev i>et.
. *
These men do not go through annoyingly long prac- j
lices. Xo paid coaches drill them. They play haphazardly,
perhaps, but with plenty of spirit. After all, the purpose
of amateur athletics is primarily sport; and only second
arily to beat a record, or beat a belter team.
Teams are organized in each living group. And groups
of independents living in Palo Alto, Menlo, or the wilds 1
this side of the golf course are of course invited lo enter
the competition. Encina usually splits up into several
teams.
Good luck, Marvie Kalm. Good luck, intra-muralers.
There may not be money in your sport, but there is sense
which is more important.
