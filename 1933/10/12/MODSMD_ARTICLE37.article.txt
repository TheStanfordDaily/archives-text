Our editorial chapeau is removed in honor of those
several Eastern universities where the winds of freedom
Mow froth off steins of beer.
Marking advancement in the eause of liberalism, which
is taught at most institutions of higher (and sometimes
drier) learning, Columbia, Duke, and other old-time uni
versities are allowing brewery representatives to Iruck
their favorite lager to the campus and even to fraternity
houses.
Well within the law, they have nothing to fear. Con
gress wisely made clear the ruling that three and two is
a non-intoxicating beverage, concocted only for the re
freshment and delight of those who will partake of it.
Scientific tests have been made during this summer to
prove that it is an impossibility to go blotto even if one
holds his mouth to the spigot and guzzles to the limit.
"Liquification" it is called, and while the results are ap
parently the same the effects are different.
Advancement in the chemistry of beer-making has en
hanced its value as ;i food, and those who have been dip
ping their noses in an occasional bucket of suds arc better
off for it. There is nothing more refreshing after sitting
in a stuffy classroom on a sultry afternoon than getting' a
good glass of cool, effervescent beer—unless it is gelling
two of the same.
