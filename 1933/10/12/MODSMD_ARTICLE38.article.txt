At the risk of appearing self-congratulatory, we draw
attention to the antics which now, as ever, occupy the time
and attention of our friends at the educational institution
in Berkeley.
The California students, according to a reliable author
ity (the San Francisco Call-Bulletin), engage in such low
activities as raiding dormitories and throwing paper bags
of water at each other.
That such things actually take place at an institution
devoted to learning is of course difficult to believe.
Frankly, we are shocked. The large student body, which
especially in a depression may include a few students who
are not gentlemen, may have something to do with it.
Here in the cloister-like quiet of the Farm, no such
crudity is possible. Scholarship above all else. Of course,
we have an official mud-tight now and then, but that really
doesn't count, as only four or five hundred students take
part in it. The Sequoia rough-houses, 100, can hardly be
taken into consideration. If a mere few dozen or half a
hundred scholars get together in an evening once in a
while (about four nights a week) for a quiet evening of
literary criticism, and they happen to accidentally push
over a few walls and break one of the scholar's legs, that
too is only incidental. The social calls the sophomore
young men pay on the freslunan gentlemen at the begin
ning of the year are another indication of the taste and
refinement shown here.
Still, in our superior way we are able to have just about
as much fun as our cruder contemporaries across the bay.
