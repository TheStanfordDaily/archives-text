# BULL SESSION
## WAR TODAY AND GONE TOMORROW 
### 
i
For the past several months the
Hearst papers have been warning
editorially of a war with Japan. War
is almost inevitable, the editorials
! solemnly state, due to the militaris-
I tic ambitions of the Japanese.
Hearst editorials are not a serious
i menace, since intelligent people read
J them only for a laugh, and the rest
i of the readers pass them over in
I their hurry to reach the sports page
j and the comic strips.
It is in the news columns that the
Hearst press gets in its really in
sidious propaganda. News stories
teli half truths calculated to excite
such powerful organizations as the
American Legion and the D.A.R. It
is possible that the Hearst editorials
may be partly right: an unnecessary
I Wui may soon be fought on the Pa-
J cific, but it will not be caused by
blood-thirsty Japanese militarists,
but by stupid patriotism and a jingo
press here and in Japan.
For example, Hearst columns were
filled a short time ago with a de
tailed account of how Japan was
preparing to build two dozen new
battleships. The reader was led to
| believe that this was proof that, the
j Japanese are cruel and rapacious,
i and bent on attacking America. No
j where did the articles point out that
i Japan's building operations were a
j direct result of President Roosevelt's
'order, several weeks prior, for 37
j new fighting ships.
Likewise, when the entire Ameri
can battle fleet held maneuvers in

i the Pacific, directed against an "im
aginary" enemy, the Hearst organs
announced that this was merely a
humanitarian attempt to prevent
war. When the Japanese fleet held
a similar war practice some weeks
later, Hearst papers all over the
country used this as an example of
j Japanese preparation to invade
America. And our patriots avidly
! swallow all this.
A war with Japan would be al
most worthwhile if we could be in
j sured that bombs would be dropped
on newspaper owners who sacrifice
decency for circulation, with a few
bombs left over for the leaders of
the American Legion and the DA.R.
j and similar hindrances to progress,
i Or equally desirable, have the war
| fought entirely by volunteers, and
i then for every soldier killed the
world would be rid of one extremely
foolish man.
American newspaper owners and
American militarists may be no ,
more offensive than those of Ja- !
pan, but they seem worse because ;
they are so much nearer. A pile of i
garbage in your own back yard may j
i not be any more odorous than a
similar pile ten miles away, but it
ii natural to object to it more.
Knowing as we do that wars are '
caused by selfish leaders for selfish j
reasons, college students have no ex- i
cuse for supporting a war with Ja- !
pan or any other country. If Hearst |
wants blood, let him slit his own
i throat. —Rolph Malloch i

For the past several months the
Hearst papers have been warning
editorially of a war with Japan. War
is almost inevitable, the editorials
! solemnly state, due to the militaris-
I tic ambitions of the Japanese.
Hearst editorials are not a serious
i menace, since intelligent people read
J them only for a laugh, and the rest
i of the readers pass them over in
I their hurry to reach the sports page
j and the comic strips.
It is in the news columns that the
Hearst press gets in its really in
sidious propaganda. News stories
teli half truths calculated to excite
such powerful organizations as the
American Legion and the D.A.R. It
is possible that the Hearst editorials
may be partly right: an unnecessary
I Wui may soon be fought on the Pa-
J cific, but it will not be caused by
blood-thirsty Japanese militarists,
but by stupid patriotism and a jingo
press here and in Japan.
For example, Hearst columns were
filled a short time ago with a de
tailed account of how Japan was
preparing to build two dozen new
battleships. The reader was led to
| believe that this was proof that, the
j Japanese are cruel and rapacious,
i and bent on attacking America. No
j where did the articles point out that
i Japan's building operations were a
j direct result of President Roosevelt's
'order, several weeks prior, for 37
j new fighting ships.
Likewise, when the entire Ameri
can battle fleet held maneuvers in

i the Pacific, directed against an "im
aginary" enemy, the Hearst organs
announced that this was merely a
humanitarian attempt to prevent
war. When the Japanese fleet held
a similar war practice some weeks
later, Hearst papers all over the
country used this as an example of
j Japanese preparation to invade
America. And our patriots avidly
! swallow all this.
A war with Japan would be al
most worthwhile if we could be in
j sured that bombs would be dropped
on newspaper owners who sacrifice
decency for circulation, with a few
bombs left over for the leaders of
the American Legion and the DA.R.
j and similar hindrances to progress,
i Or equally desirable, have the war
| fought entirely by volunteers, and
i then for every soldier killed the
world would be rid of one extremely
foolish man.
