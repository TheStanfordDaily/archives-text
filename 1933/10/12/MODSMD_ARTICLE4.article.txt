# After Repeal, What?
## 
### 
With repeal a virtual certainty by
Dec. 6, there still exists the question
ol how to cope with the situation
which will then present, itself. Un
der F.R.'s orders, agencies of study
of control laws are being co-ordi
nated, tax laws examined. Main
cause for worry and bootleggers' big
chance lie in the high domestic liq
uor tax of $1.10 a gallon, still higher
import tax of $5. Officials feel that
dry states will be adequately pro
tecied by the Reed and Webb-Ken
yon laws, but the nine states which
have no control laws are expected
to cause trouble; their governors
have been urged to set up regula
tory machinery.
Some states are experimenting:
Montana has established a liquor
monoply; under the influence of the
Rockefeller study, New York leans
toward a centralized state liquor
authority rather than a politically
corrupt license system.
