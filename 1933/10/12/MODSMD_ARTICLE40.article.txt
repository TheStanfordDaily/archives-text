I
j TIIE BARBARY COAST
By Herbert Asbury. Alfred A.
Knopf. 1 $3.00.
With nutmeg, a thick supply of
I garlic, and considerable cayenne
! pepper has Herbert Asbury sea
j soned his lively chronicle of San
j Francisco's renowned claim to de
' pravity. Not all of it is tasty, but
j it provides amused, amazed, read
ing. .
Fortunately Mr. Asbury's compe- !
tent journalism does not run away j
with his scholarship. He has painted
the picture of a rowdy, unbelievable
j historical pageant without exaggera
tion. with restraint, aad with wit.
Certainly the Boarbary Coast hardly
reeded artificial coloring to make it
picturesque. But Mr. Asbury is the '
first historian of early San Fran- j
cisco to sift his exciting material !
down to accuracy and infuse his
knack of story-telling with the same 1

authoritative simplicity which dis
tinguished his previous books on
"The Gangs of New York" and
"Carrie Nation."
The accounts of San Francisco's
adolescence in the frantic youthful
reigns of the Barbary Coast are va
ried and adventurous. The end of
the book tends to lose interest, in
a repetitious recital of the interiors
of brothels, but here Mr. Asbury
wisely adds the spice of quotations,
, from such advertisements as those
of Big Matilda or Madame Lucy.
He brings a speedy climax to his
j history, and the frayed curtain rolls
down on the last Barbary Coast en
tertainment, its glory outmoded, de
cadent, too provincial for the new
city of San Francisco.
The photographs in the book are
! amusing, and the whole thing is a
! good cure for your nostalgia, if it
I has been bothering you lately.
