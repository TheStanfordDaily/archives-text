The comedy of errors that pur
ports to be a report of my lecture in
the opening of the Public Exercises
Tuesday evening might be passed
j without comment, even though it
; excels as an example of juvenile
| journalism, but it contains one state
! ment which may cause unreasonable
I alarm and which is not true. I did
; not "declare" the "Stanford build
! ings" to be "unsafe." Had I referred
i to them I would have quoted Dr.
I Wilbur's assurance, given me not
j long since, that the architects had
I been instructed to use every rea
i scripble precaution to make them
j safe. What I did say was that the
community on the Campus should
| have a building inspection not less
| rigid than that which has made
Palo Alto safe and I implied a doubt
if that were so. That doubt has
been suggested by the apparent lack
of supervision of construction of pri
vate residences and fraternity
! hcuses. —Bailey Willis.
