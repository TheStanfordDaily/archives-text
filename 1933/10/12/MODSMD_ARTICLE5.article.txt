possible th 6 appointment of Rothert,
had consented to accept the posi
tion of General Alumni Secretary.
Long time Secretary McDowell will
act in an advisory capacity to newly
appointed Secretary Rothert for one
3 ear. He will then withdraw from
duty after 25 years of service.
Alumni President Robex-t Mur
phey was most effusive in his praise
of McDowell. Mentioned he in his
letter to the Illustrated Review to
appear Friday, such phrases as:
"Unanimous appreciation," "long
years of service," "grateful spirit of
ihe alumni," etc.
For the last four months, Rothert
hay been acting as Field Secretary,

pects. From this position, it. was but
natural and expected that he would
be advanced when McDowell re
signed.
McDowell has a long record at
Stanford. First, student; then, As
sisiant-Registrar; later, Dean of
Men; finally, Alurnni Secretary and
Secretary to the Academic Council.
