# TENNIS CHAMPIONS RETURN; GLEDHILL OUT OF TOURNEYS
## 
### 
On Stanford's widely heralded
| campus this quarter are registered
perhaps the greatest assortment of
past, present, and future tennis
playing collegians ever assembled
under the same university banner,
j Foremost of racket-wielders is
Keith Gledhill, soft-spoken interna
i tionalist, who made his debut into
tennis circles of the elite under the
Cardinal banner. He recently de
feated Lcs Stoeffen, men's national
singles finalist, to win the Pacific
i Coast tourney. Gledhill has one
1 more quarter of school, but has al
, ready played three years, is there
fore ineligible.
Second in prestige is Joe Cough
lin, left-handed placement hitter,
] who captained the 1933 team, and
won the Intercollegiate doubles
paired with Sam Lee. Coughlin aljo
boasts of a 19152 Intercollegiate dou
bles title, when teamed with afore
mentioned Gledhill.
Chuck Otis, captain-elect and ten
| nis teacher extraordinary, as he
proved to a meeting of frosh and
varsity net men yesterday, leads the
future varsity into conference bat
: ties. He boasts a strong aggressive
game, and two years of caginess.
Behind him are tow-headed Sam
'my Lee, owner of a joint intercolle
giate title, and an imperturbable ex
pression, and last year's frosh cap
: tain, Johnny Law.
The frosh netmen, who could
probably beat the varsity this year,
â–  have as a nucleus Ben Dey, national
I junior boys' doubles finalist this
year, and Billy Seward, the L.A. boy
with a Tilden-like backhand. Be
hind them come Bob Pommer and
Edwin Ganss, the former of whom
must learn to play consistently, and
the latter, a fast man on the courts,
using a flat-topped a-la-Crawford
type of #aquet.
