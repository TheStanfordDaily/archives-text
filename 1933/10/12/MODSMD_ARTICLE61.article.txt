Demonstrating to his charges
where to expect the S.C. bone
crushing power thrust and what to
do about it, decisive, fast-talking,
Coach Jimmie Bradshaw continued
last night to prepare the frosh grid
men for their coming Saturday's ef
fort at humbling the Mighty Young
sters of Troy in Los Angeles.
Designating certain hard-working
reserves as Kidder, Keller, and other
feared Trobabe stars, Bradshaw
showed his husky linemen, individ
ually and collectively, when to
charge in, when to fade back, when
to spill the interference, when to go
for the runner.
Big, red-headed Jack Walton, 200-
pound guard, has been picked to
| shift into the backfiald to guard
against passes, popular offensive
weapons of the Trobabes. No up

raised arms to prevent passes, de
crees Bradshaw; charging linemen
must go for the passer and tackle
him, there being no rule against
roughing the man who throws the
ball.
Destined to draw a starting guard
assignment is Ray Williamson,
brother of S.C.'s center-playing for
mer Captain Stan Williamson.
Starting the season as a tackle, Wil
liamson was recently shifted to the
light guard post.
Carl Schott, left end, and Walt
Chouteau, right wingman, wfll shift
positions on defense, Chouteau feel
ing more at home on the left defen
sive flank. Designated by pre-season
publicity as a 200-pounder, Chou
teau has miraculously shrunk to
175, probably much nearer his ac
tual weight.
