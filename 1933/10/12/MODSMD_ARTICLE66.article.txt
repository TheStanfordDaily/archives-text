# INDIAN TRACKMEN UNDERTAKE FIRST LIGHT WORKOUTS
## 
### 
Effects of the last three months,
lack in training, have been coming to
the fore at Angell field during the
past two days. Coaches Dink Tem
pleton and Bill Ellington began gril
ling .more than 50 candidates for
the 1934 Stanford track and field
teams Monday afternoon.
The routine of limbering up ex
ercises and methodical jogging
which made up the entire workout
Monday was followed yesterday
with a bit of light practice on in
dividual events.
Sprinters and distance men alike
pranced about the track, while high
jumpers took a few practice hops
and weight men tossed their respec
tive weapons around the field.
Led by Phil Williams, the Indian
who triumphed over Troy in the first
meet last year, the broad jumping
contingent will work on sprinting
and starts for some time yet. This
group will do no actual jumping
this week. Pole vaulters also utili
zed yesterday's practice in sprinting
and starting. Bud Deacon, ace bam
boo bounder, joined the sprinters in
a bit of relay work and in a couple
of leaps proved his potentialities as
a high jumper.
Although the majority of next
spring's Indian cinder path artists
will be made following the foot
ball season.
Bobby Grayson and Johnny Reis
ner, Indian backlield men, will com
pete in the sprints. Paul Zaches,
also a backfield man, will team
with Williams to form a broad
jumping combination that will be
hard to beat. "Slinger" Dunn, who

I entered Stanford in the spring quar
' ter of last year and captured sev
eral first places in the shot and
discus, is now a substitute tackle
ion "Tiny" Thornhill's Cardinal
| gridiron machine.
Ellington, who will have charge
of the freshman forces, has sched
j ulcd a meeting of ihe yearling as
| pirants for next week.
