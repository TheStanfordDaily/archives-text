## 
### 
Further details in the strange at
tempt of Ramon Starr Wilson to
commit suicide in a Palo Alto air
port plane Monday morning were
revealed yesterday when campus
and Palo Alto (officers recovered
three articles stolen from the Chi
Psi Lodge.
Acting on a hunch that Wilson
might have been connected with the
Chi Psi burglary Monday morning,
campus Officer George Burns went
to work with Palo Alto Police In
spector L. S. Lawrence. They found
seven witnesses who had seen a San
Francisco taxi cab on the campus.
Working on that clue, they went
to the city; by investigation found
the taxi-cab driver. He told officers
he brought Wilson down to Stan
ford and when his passenger was
unable to pay, the latter went into
the Chi Psi Lodge, returned with
two tennis raquets and a small ra
dio, giving them in lieu of payment.
He also gave the driver a $40 wrist
watch procured on a bad check.
Wilson was held yesterday to an
swer to the Superior Court on a
charge of passing bad checks by
Judge John E. Springer. Justice of
Peace E. E. Hardy set Friday after
noon at 2 o'clock as the time for
Wilson's hearing on bad check
charges.
