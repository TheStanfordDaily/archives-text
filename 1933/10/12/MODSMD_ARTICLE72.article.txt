# Workmen Repair Stained Glass Windows of Chapel
## 
### 
"No, we're not washing windows,"
the carpenter with a startling Eng
lish accent called down from scaf
folding around one of the tall,
stained windows in the Memorial
Church.
"We're reinforcing the glass up
here, it's beginning to sag with the
weight of the building. You'd bet
ter ask the glass-men in the base
j ment about it."
In the dark Church basement a
swarthy Italian, like a Renaissance
! artisan, bent over the upper half
of one of the huge windows. With
a steel brush he was.cleaning long
-1 collected dirt from the face of a
Christ. His overalled fellow work- I
man was sorting strips of flexible
steel. Both were affable and explan
atory.
"The windows were taken out '
after the 1906 earthquake, and later
put in wrong. They have begun to j
sag and bulge, not noticeably, but
if they were left long enough, they
i would eventually break. For the
past three years we have been re
| pairing a few at a time. Each takes
about one week to doâ€”it would take |
four years of steady work to remove i
and re-enforce each window in the
Church.
These windows are made of leaded
glass and represent an art that was t
1 begun as early as the 11th century 1
in Italy, added the workman. "Some
of them weigh over 200 pounds and i
are of several thicknesses in order
to attain delicate colorings. The [
Memorial Church had it windows
: done in the x-ealistic style which is
no longer the vogue in stained glass.
"Everything nowadays is sym
! bolic. The old realistic windows j
were just pictures. They too life
like and one tired of them* The
I symbolic suggests and sort of grows j
' on one, you know."
