This shirt knows
your body
When you put on Arrow's new form-fitting Mitoga
—you'll swear it was made only for you! It drapes
in at the waist, eliminating those old-time blouse
effects. It conforms \o your shoulders . . . tapers
with the arms. The Mitoga is made possible, first,
by Arrow's skilled tailoring, second, by Arrow's
own Sanforizing process which sees to it that the
Mitoga keeps its perfect fit through a lifetime of
launderings. The Mitoga comes in most all Arrow
styles, patterns, and collar versions. $ 2 up
