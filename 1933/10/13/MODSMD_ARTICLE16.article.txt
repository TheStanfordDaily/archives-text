Fraternity bosses show their sa- J
distic sense of humor by officially
opening Hell Week today, Friday
the Thirteenth.
A word of explanation to profes
sors to explain why students will
be standing up to listen to class j
lectures for the next few days. It's j
just hell.
Another word to custodians of va
rious halls to explain why pillows j
will probably be missing from rooms. ]
Pillows, when placed at a certain
point on the human body are often
helpful as shock absorbers. More
hell.

members to got out and dust off
their little, erâ€”large paddles and
