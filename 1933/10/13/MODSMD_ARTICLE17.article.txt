# COEDS SQUIRM AS DR. BAILEY RAZZES HOUSES
## Noted Shakespeare Expert Discusses Sororities, Herd Instincts 
### Dave Mellinkoff 
The usual crowd of roughs and
co-eds filled Stanford's green and
gloomy Little Theatre at 9 o'clock
yesterday morning to attend a lec
ture on Renaissance background of
the Shakespearean drama.
And, in time, they did learn of
Renaissance, but not until Phi
Bete and English professor, Mar
gery Bailey, '14, had scored Stan
ford sororities, in particular; herd
instict, foolish females, and the
j Daily, in general.
Unfolding a copy of the Daily,
roaster Bailey glanced sardonically
over the headline: "Sorority Chiefs
Air Views on Rushing," recalled to
the class her old thesis: "In heaven's
name, be independent."
Thundered out of the spirited
professor: "You silly females . . .
you come here for a sorority, so
j that you can marry something in
j a fraternity."
Men and women tittered, prepared
! to laugh off the remark, when came
| bursting forth: "See what I mean by
j being brought up like herds of cat
tle? Go to a house and you'll be
j that way early!"
Eyebrows arched, tone sarcastic,
Shakespeare's Bailey mocked the
Daily statement of Hedden of Pi
Beta Phi, who lamented that " a
very small proportion of new women
will have an opportunity to affi
liate." The lecturer commented:
"Tragedy, stark tragedy!"
The storm was not ended: "Far
better to be lonely in a dormitory,
.than to rush into the wild hyste-.
ria of the sorority, and follow the
herd. Wait till you are in a house;
then you'll see what it's like. You
ought to sec the inside of one of
those antiques."
Every phase of the problem came
in fo'r consideration: "You sorority
women will have the pleasure of
having a number of addle-pated
alumnae—who can never think for
themselves—to associate with in
later life."
The Thetas, she thought, have a
"pretty sensible house; a gx*eat many
professors' daughters are there."
No trifler, Miss Bailey, who did
not join a social sorority while an
undergraduate at Stanford, con
cluded: "I'll call the roll the day
after rushing; if there are any of
you absent, there'll be something
popping." She would tolerate no
sentimental coddling of Stanford
women.
Opening her series of remarks,
commentator Bailey, former Mas
quer, Cap and Gown, Women's Press
Clubber, happy Chappie and mem
ber of the Quad staff of 1914, had
said of the Stanford Daily: "You
must always remember that in the
Dippy you are always recognized as
an absolute and utter fool."
She did not know until the con
clusion of her discussion of Renais
sance superstition that Daily re
porters had sat quietly, written
steadily, and taken down her more
spicy quotation.
