# ALL-UNIVERSITY DANCE TONIGHT
## Royal Cardinals to Provide Music, Vocal Trio 
### 
Campus males drag out their
spring duds tonight, while a few
forlorn Roughs telephone remnants
of the "750" in frantic efforts to
scare up a date.
Occasion is A.S.S.U.'s first gargan
tuan effort, a sport informal in Oc
tober. Well-oiled machinery of
Rally Committee effort on the part
of Les Hables, student, manager,
makes possible the all-University
brainstorm, at a bid price of 75
cents, considerably lower than the
usual extravaganza-type of dance
fest.
A1 Rushton and his Boisterous
Boys, otherwise known as ihc
Royal Cardinals, go in for another
acc-in-the-hand when they pro
duce the Three Royal Cards, mu
sical trio featuring Downey-like
George McKee. Rushton plans
using a ten-piece effect, suffi
ciently slow numbers, and enough
rhythm to make hotel-dancing
seem futile.
Lighting effects, displaying more
than the usual scattered blue light
arc-effect, are promised by Milo
Tally, whose usual lighting of the
Women's Gym smacks of supreme
artistry.
Despite the usual absence of any
liquid stronger than punch, a re
freshment. booth is assured all
thirsty thespians tonight.
Dancing will begin at 9 o'clock
and continue until 1 o'clock. The
usual rush for uncertain seats,
around the fountain in the court
will be eliminated. Chairman Beau
baire and his Rally cohorts have ar
ranged for comfortable seats during
dancing lulls.
With 75-cent admission price,
plenty of dance room and women
with whom to dance, the campus
will probably see most of its resi
dents on hand tonight at the Gym.
