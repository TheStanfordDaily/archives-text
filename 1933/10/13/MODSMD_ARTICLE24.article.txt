# CALL ISSUED BY DIRECTOR FOR GAIETIES SKITS
## Big Game Funfest Will Be Unique in Staging Of Scenic Effects 
### 
Stanford's drama Director Har
old Helvenston today issued a call
to all campus dramatists, play
wrights and would-be-producers to
turn their thoughts and creative
powers to the script for the annual
"Big Game Gaieties." Original songs
and skits from campus talent have
composed the "Gaieties" in the past.
Unique, Brilliant
Said dapper Director Helvenston:
"The Gaieties this year are going
to be highly unique and brilliant.
New ideas of staging and different
scenery structural units will be used
to emphasize chorus numbers, full
stage numbers, and the use and
placement of the band. November 4
is the deadline for acts and songs."
The sets for the 1933 "Gaieties"
will be designed by Helvenston, who
has a national reputation in that
line of work. All upperclass women
transfers included are urged nol to
be bashful in presenting their ideas.
Ram's Head
This year's addition of the Gaieties
will be produced by the Ram's Ik-ad,
campus men's honorary dramatic
society. The script is to be handed
in to Johnny Peckham, Chi Psi
House or Director Harold Helven
ston.
