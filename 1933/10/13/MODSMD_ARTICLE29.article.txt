# Stanford Varsity Faces Big Test In Eastern Tilt
## Thornhill's Squad Prepared to Make Impressive Debut Against Wildcats; Hanley's Team Ready To Bombard Cards With Fancy Passes 
### BY SPUD HAMILTON 
Willi the football moguls of the East drawn to Chicago like steel liling l *
to a magnet, Coach Tiny Thornhill and his band of 34 stand ready to make
their really big-time debut tomorrow. Stanford clashes with Northwest
em's Wildcats, the big Purple team which for years has been one of the
ace performers in the Big Ten, admitted by most to be the cream of
football competition.
True, Stanford under Thornhill has already completed successfully
three early season games, but they were played at home and among

►friends, so to speak. Now, the Cardi
nals are lost in the big Windy City
where tomorrow they will be ex
posed to the scrutiny of a hard
boiled audience of minor coaches
who are getting away for the day,
as well as officials and the ever
ominisceni chorus of sports writers.
A fair and impartial audience it i.s;
one which is ready to give either
approval or the Bronx cheer.
Stanford stands lomorrow in some
respects like the Stanford team that
traveled East to play the Army in
1928, with the exception, that at that
time no one cared much who or
what Stanford was, while a great
many thought the Army was the
best in the East. A band that in
cluded Bob Sims, "Biff" Hoffman,
Lud Frentrup, Don Robesky, and
"Dynamite" Post walked out and
stalled playing with all the perfec
tion of a Warner football team at
its best, and the incredulous East
saw its best team flung from yard
line to yard line, while the Indians
won, 26-0.
The game between Stanford and
Northwestern, played on Soldier's
Field at Chicago tomorrow, will
be broadcast locally through Sta
tion KFRC.
Watch Thornhill
Today the coaches are different,
the players are different, and the
experts, instead of being indifferent,
are cocked with a ready eye to see
just what it is this guy Thornhill's
got. They expect Stanford to repeat
the brilliance of 1928, and they will
be disappointed if Thornhill and his
gang of green kids don't come
through.
Coach Dick Hanley is admitting
defeat almost too soon; his singin'
the blues reminds one of the canny
"Olc Fox" Warner at his bluest best.
Hanley has a crew of youngsters
too, and in their first time out in
varsity competition they receipted
for a 7-0 walloping from the hands
of lowa.
New Linc-Up
For the game tomorrow, Hanley
has completely revamped his back
field and according to the Associ
ated Press, is much encouraged over
his men's showing in the last two
days. The latest dope is that the
Wildcat leader will start his blond
thatched long-kicking Olie Olson at
quarter, with Chuck Duvall at full
and Harry Leiber and Cally Cruice
at halves.
Hanley declared that his defense
looked improved, and he tapered off
work in that department last night.
Even though his offense was also
clicking in the last session, the
Northwestern coach continued in his
minor-key outlook on tomorrow.
Not until the shouting and the tu
mult dies in Soldier's Field will the
public at large know whether for
once a football coach spoke the
truth, or that as usual, it was the
same old brand of malarky.

Coach Dick Hanley is admitting
defeat almost too soon; his singin'
the blues reminds one of the canny
"Olc Fox" Warner at his bluest best.
Hanley has a crew of youngsters
too, and in their first time out in
varsity competition they receipted
for a 7-0 walloping from the hands
of lowa.
New Linc-Up
For the game tomorrow, Hanley
has completely revamped his back
field and according to the Associ
ated Press, is much encouraged over
his men's showing in the last two
days. The latest dope is that the
Wildcat leader will start his blond
thatched long-kicking Olie Olson at
quarter, with Chuck Duvall at full
and Harry Leiber and Cally Cruice
at halves.
Hanley declared that his defense
looked improved, and he tapered off
work in that department last night.
Even though his offense was also
clicking in the last session, the
Northwestern coach continued in his
minor-key outlook on tomorrow.
Not until the shouting and the tu
mult dies in Soldier's Field will the
public at large know whether for
once a football coach spoke the
truth, or that as usual, it was the
same old brand of malarky.
Willi the football moguls of the East drawn to Chicago like steel liling l *
to a magnet, Coach Tiny Thornhill and his band of 34 stand ready to make
their really big-time debut tomorrow. Stanford clashes with Northwest
em's Wildcats, the big Purple team which for years has been one of the
ace performers in the Big Ten, admitted by most to be the cream of
football competition.
True, Stanford under Thornhill has already completed successfully
three early season games, but they were played at home and among

►friends, so to speak. Now, the Cardi
nals are lost in the big Windy City
where tomorrow they will be ex
posed to the scrutiny of a hard
boiled audience of minor coaches
who are getting away for the day,
as well as officials and the ever
ominisceni chorus of sports writers.
A fair and impartial audience it i.s;
one which is ready to give either
approval or the Bronx cheer.
Stanford stands lomorrow in some
respects like the Stanford team that
traveled East to play the Army in
1928, with the exception, that at that
time no one cared much who or
what Stanford was, while a great
many thought the Army was the
best in the East. A band that in
cluded Bob Sims, "Biff" Hoffman,
Lud Frentrup, Don Robesky, and
"Dynamite" Post walked out and
stalled playing with all the perfec
tion of a Warner football team at
its best, and the incredulous East
saw its best team flung from yard
line to yard line, while the Indians
won, 26-0.
The game between Stanford and
Northwestern, played on Soldier's
Field at Chicago tomorrow, will
be broadcast locally through Sta
tion KFRC.
Watch Thornhill
Today the coaches are different,
the players are different, and the
experts, instead of being indifferent,
are cocked with a ready eye to see
just what it is this guy Thornhill's
got. They expect Stanford to repeat
the brilliance of 1928, and they will
be disappointed if Thornhill and his
gang of green kids don't come
through.
