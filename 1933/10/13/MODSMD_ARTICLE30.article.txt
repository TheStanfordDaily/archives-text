# Greek Rules Are Defined For Campus
## Stiff Penalties Set For All Violations 
### 
In a meeting last night the Inter
fraternity Board defined rushing
rules for the current year.
Donn Tatum, president, announced
that "Normal contact of public and
informal nature on. the campus is
interpreted to mean association be
tween fraternity and new lower di
vision men in which the idea of
rushing is not obviously paramount.
Such normal contact can be distin
guished from that which is illegal
by the fact that it is not carefully
premediated and that the fraternity
men involved are not spending any
money on the new lower division
men with whom they are. in con
tact.
Normal Contact
"The unconcealed association of
one or two fraternity men and a
like number of new lower division
men on the campus is permissablc.
But any gathering of a larger na
ture, especially one which is secret
in its nature and has appearance of
a planned party, is illegal.
"No off-campus rushing except
during the period between quarters
rnd Thanksgiving vacation is per
mitted. Formal rushing will come
in three two-day periods and a final
one of four days. The first period
will be on third and
fourth with pledging on January
19th."
Encina Taboo
Tatum stated that fraternity men
must stay out of Encina for any
purpose whatsoever. Penalty for in
fraction of these rules is postpone
ment of rushing and pledging or the
limitation on the number of men to
be pledged, or both, to be applied
by the Board both as to the frater
nity and freshmen involved as the
circumstances of the case warrant.
The Board reserves the right to
judge the legality of any case on its
merit.
