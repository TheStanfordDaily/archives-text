# Alas, Alack, Alas Again!

I nbelievable and terrifying as il may sound, il seems
I rue I luil lliere will nol be 5,000 Stanford rooters to faee
tbose terrible Trojan fellows down at I'.S.C. Even worse,
there will not be 2,000. Hopes have now simmered down
lo 1,,'Mi0.. The final eount may even shatter these poor
hopes. Alas, alack, alas again. *
Ihe proud name of Stanford will be lowered sub
merged even in the deep, dark mud of everlasting dis
grace. Imagine, the horror of it all. Stanford, proud home
of culture and education, will be out-veiled by those Tro
jan hordes. And for what reason, may you well ask. Stan
lord will be disgraced because the student body will not
forsake classes, travel a paltry thousand miles to witness
;i football game.
II is enough lo make one's loyally colored blood boil
;ind simmer in the veins, arteries, and even the smallest
capillaries. Two rally committee men, it is rumored, have
boiled over their blood now oozing out of their ears and
even dropping pitifully from their lowered beagles in soul- I
stirring drops. II is to mourn. Alas, alack, alas again.
The football team is at stake and the student-body, with
vile indifference, has refused to go south. Bui it goes much
deeper. Ihe ( Diversity is at stake, and the I niversily has
been descried. A new race of Stanford men now breathe
this fair air, il seems. A race too cowardly to defend its
Alma Mater, and carry a splitting headache back to the
Farm after a defending week-end in Los Angeles. II is to
mourn.
That Noble Red Cap brigade! How they charged over
and over this campus carrying the message, not that the ,
Trojans were coming, but that they would be there. There,
in Los Angeles, waiting for 2,000 rooters.
And it is true that those Trojans will be waiting. Bui
wait they must in vain. And will they feel foolish?
But, it was a noble charge, noble Red Caps, noble cause,
noble nobility. Alas, alack, alas again.
