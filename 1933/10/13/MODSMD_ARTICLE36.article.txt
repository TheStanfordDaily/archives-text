NOW THAT Chaparral is a pretty fair mag, wliicli
from Ihe Daily is a compliment of which there is none
vine her. To think that the Old Hoy could kick through
with something which actually nears tickling our funny
hone is almost unbelievable. For a change, there really
was one (1) line in il which approached the humorous
vein.
Kditor .lames Nelson Algar, who will be an old man
for one year, draws an applaud from this esteemed publi
cation, which luis a par so much greater than that of ("hap- j
pie that anything we say of the funny rag is a compliment.
Seriously speaking, the tribute paid the late Professor
Everett Wallace Smith was a beautiful thing. Artist Oliver
Johnston did a neat piece of work, and the remarks of
llristow Adams, '00, blended well with the drawing.
Also, we appreciated Algar's yarn about the little Dutch
bov, who thumbed Palo Alto out of beer.
Bigger and better humor, all for If) cents. Wotta break
for the common people. May C.happic prosper under its
new management until the Daily football team drags it 1
through the mud in that stadium classic here next month.
