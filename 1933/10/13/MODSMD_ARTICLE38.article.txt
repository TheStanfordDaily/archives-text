TORCH SINGER (Paramount)
At the Stanford Theatre
A picture bearing the title
, "Torch Singer," accompanied by
lurid advertisements to the effect
that "lips that kissed men she
couldn't remember sang love songs
no one could forget" and that "the
worst woman in town sang 50,000
babies (or some such number) to
sleep every night"—a foundling
picture with that kind of a note
pinned to its blanket has an uphill
fight. That this particular one
manages to be entertaining is due
largely to the presence, person
ality, and gowns of Claudette Col
bcrt.
Obvious to the extreme, the narra
tive relates the short and simple an
nals of an unwed mother who ,sur
venders her child in order that she
(the mother) may become a torch
singer and later "Aunt Jenny of the
Pure Foods Hour." Of course, no
one is more surprised than you are
when she finds both the child and
the father through the medium of
that wonderful invention, the radio.
Not so gay as in "Three Cor
nered Moon," Miss Colbert turns
a clearly-defined and very con
sistent characterization, not to
mention a couple of very good
tunes. She manages to avoid the
obvious while in the midst of the
obvious.
Ricardo Cortez is surprisingly !
i good in a sympathetic role, and Da
vid Manners is fairly unconvincing
in a very negligible one. Baby Le- \
roy, in case you are interested, has
one microscopic scene. —Chapin
DOUBLE HARNESS (Warner)
At the California Theatre
If you happen to be a person who,
long years ago, enjoyed Ann Hard- ;
ing in "Holiday" and have since j
been hoping for an encore, "Double j
Harness" may do something to warm I
the cockles of your heart.
There is a welcome celerity and
finesse to this picture, thanks to
the leading players. Miss Harding
i.nd William Powell, who prove a 1
pair admirably well suited to
each other. The dialogue is sel
dom brilliant, but it is at all times
entertaining, and the last episode
is outstanding.
The lightweight story deals with
a girl who, in the vernacular, gets
her man. Her various means, fair
and foul, and her ultimate repent
ance and (surprise!) forgiveness
make up the action. Which, if not
astonishing, is at least satisfactory.
Though her role is larger. Miss
Harding has less opportunity than
in "When Ladies Meet." However,
she achieves a well-rounded and
charming interpretation, and again
demonstrates that—l stiil maintain
—she has the finest voice on the

screen today.
Powell does his best work in some
time, by virtue of taking a spineless
role and making of it a genuine
characterization.
Henry Stephenson, one of the
screen's most charming supporting
while Lillian Bond is adequate as
players, is excellent as the father,
the "other woman." —Chapin
