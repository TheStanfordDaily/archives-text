# Freshmen Count on Line Power to Stop S. C.
## U.S.C. FROSH RELY ON BACKS TO WIN OVER CARD BABES Gridders Leave Tonight For Annual Clash 
### Charles Chappell 
Whether their powerful line can
nullify the admitted advantage of
ttiu S.C. Trobabes in the backfield is
the problem, and the hope for vic
tory, that Stanford's frosh gridmen
carry with them as they entrain to
night for Southern California.
No weak team such as bowed
to the Indian freshmen last year
awaits this season's first-year men.
A strong team, boasting all-This
and That players by the dozen,
represents the 1933 S.C. frosh.
Likewise handicapping Stanford,
this year's team has nothing to
equal the manpower that last sea
son's history-making Trojan con
querors had.
Despite this falling off from last
year's advantage, the Stanford frosh
have a 50-50 chance, say competent
observers, of upsetting the Trojan
Junior Juggernaught. A strong line
and a fair backfield for Stanford, a
fair line and a strong backfield for
S.C.—that will be the set-up as the
two teams take the field tomorrow 1
at high noon in the Coliseum, Olym
pic Stadium, Memorial Stadium or |
what have you, depending on the j
latest whim of the Angeleno powers- !
that-be.
Starting Line-Up
Starting the game for Stanford
will be Carl Schott and Walt Chou
teau, ends; Louis Tsoutsouvas and
Dale Beedle, tackles; Ray William
son and Jack Walton, guards; (
George Bergman, center; Joe Vigna
and Fred Williams, halves; A1 Brent,
quarterback; and Chuck Ledbetter,
fullback. Although holding down a
halfback job, Vigna will continue j
to call signals.
With S.C. having only average
punters, Grigo Turretto, Stanford's
60-yard booter, will be used only
if the Indian frosh get in a hole.
Set to drive in and stop S.C.'s bril
liant, plunging star, Keller, will be J
husky Chuck Ledbetter, Stanford's;
own none-too-gentle exponent of
ihe art of fullbacking.
Southern Frosh
Playing under Southern Califor
nia's sunny skies will be no new ex- ,
perience to at least five Stanford i
si alters. Tsoutsouvas hails from '
Santa Barbara, Chouteau is a Los
Angeles boy, Brent comes from San
Diego, Ledbetter claims Placentia as
his home town, while Bergman is
from Inglewood where he was a
team-mate of S.C.'s famous Keller.
Jim Reynolds, reserve end, also lives
in Los Angeles, although he went to
prep school at Kiski.
The following men will make the [
trip South:
Schott, Jenkins, Elder, Chouteau,
Reynolds, ends; Beedle, Williamson,
Tsoutsouvas, and Taylor, tackles; j
Hurley, Spinnetti, Walton, Cottrell,
and Gison, guards; Bergman and
Quails, centers; Brent, Turretto,
Vigna, Rolls, Williams, Ledbetter,
Reed, and Voigt, backs.

Starting the game for Stanford
will be Carl Schott and Walt Chou
teau, ends; Louis Tsoutsouvas and
Dale Beedle, tackles; Ray William
son and Jack Walton, guards; (
George Bergman, center; Joe Vigna
and Fred Williams, halves; A1 Brent,
quarterback; and Chuck Ledbetter,
fullback. Although holding down a
halfback job, Vigna will continue j
to call signals.
With S.C. having only average
punters, Grigo Turretto, Stanford's
60-yard booter, will be used only
if the Indian frosh get in a hole.
Set to drive in and stop S.C.'s bril
liant, plunging star, Keller, will be J
husky Chuck Ledbetter, Stanford's;
own none-too-gentle exponent of
ihe art of fullbacking.
Southern Frosh
Playing under Southern Califor
nia's sunny skies will be no new ex- ,
perience to at least five Stanford i
si alters. Tsoutsouvas hails from '
Santa Barbara, Chouteau is a Los
Angeles boy, Brent comes from San
Diego, Ledbetter claims Placentia as
his home town, while Bergman is
from Inglewood where he was a
team-mate of S.C.'s famous Keller.
Jim Reynolds, reserve end, also lives
in Los Angeles, although he went to
prep school at Kiski.
The following men will make the [
trip South:
Schott, Jenkins, Elder, Chouteau,
Reynolds, ends; Beedle, Williamson,
Tsoutsouvas, and Taylor, tackles; j
Hurley, Spinnetti, Walton, Cottrell,
and Gison, guards; Bergman and
Quails, centers; Brent, Turretto,
Vigna, Rolls, Williams, Ledbetter,
Reed, and Voigt, backs.
Whether their powerful line can
nullify the admitted advantage of
ttiu S.C. Trobabes in the backfield is
the problem, and the hope for vic
tory, that Stanford's frosh gridmen
carry with them as they entrain to
night for Southern California.
No weak team such as bowed
to the Indian freshmen last year
awaits this season's first-year men.
A strong team, boasting all-This
and That players by the dozen,
represents the 1933 S.C. frosh.
Likewise handicapping Stanford,
this year's team has nothing to
equal the manpower that last sea
son's history-making Trojan con
querors had.
Despite this falling off from last
year's advantage, the Stanford frosh
have a 50-50 chance, say competent
observers, of upsetting the Trojan
Junior Juggernaught. A strong line
and a fair backfield for Stanford, a
fair line and a strong backfield for
S.C.—that will be the set-up as the
two teams take the field tomorrow 1
at high noon in the Coliseum, Olym
pic Stadium, Memorial Stadium or |
what have you, depending on the j
latest whim of the Angeleno powers- !
that-be.
