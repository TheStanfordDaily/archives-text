Saturday's game at Soldier's Field in Chicago promises to be a repeti
tion of the Santa Clara-Stanford game i! Coach Mauley's printed inten
tions to make the game a passing battle is true. lianJey has two excellent
passers in his quarterbacks, Olson and Auguston, and a real pass receiver j
in his veteran end, Manske. The contest offers another parallel to last
week in that Hanley, just as Clipper Smith, is counting heavily on kick
ing to jam the Cards into the hole and keep them there for the duration
of the game. Northwestern's man Olson is reputed the best punter in
the Big Ten.
Well, Indians Maentz and Alustiza leveled things up against Paglia, and '
we have a sneaking hunch that they will do the same witb kicker Olson of
the Wildcats. Stanford and Northwestern possess a number of things in 1
common. First of all they both employ the Warner system, or at least a f
modified Warner system. Hanley shoots in a number of single wing forma- 1
| tions just as Thornhill has been doing this season. Both teams have more j
than the usual number of sophomores in the starting line-up, and both ace
said to be fast but green.
If Bobby Grayson gets away for some goodly gains tomorrow, the
spectators in Soldier's Field may be reminded of their famed halfback,
"Pug" Renter. We never had the privilege of seeing that dynamic gentle
man play, except through tlifc dubious medium of the news reel. But in
one flash we saw Renter get off around left end for a 24-yard gain against
Ohio State. The thing nearest to that picture of Rentner that we've seen |
was Bobby Grayson pounding straight down the field in rugby, shaking
tacklers loose, never swerving from that dead course ahead.
Ouch! Who said that the loss of Smith and Brown would cripple the 1
Trojan forward wall? We have just come across statistics of the Washing
j ton State-Southern California game and we learned that W.S.C. gained
just 48 yards from scrimmage through that S.C. line. And Warburton,
I Griffith, Howard, et. al., picked up a mere 434 yards from the Cougars.
When Ho war Harpster was an Ail-American for Carnegie Tech, he
was touted as one of the greatest of forward passers. Now,- as the youthful
! coach of his Alma Mater, Harpster has built a deadly aeriel attack, with j
I which his Skibos buried "Pop" Warner's up-and-coming Temple Owls
| last week.
"Sleepy Jimmy" Crowley, one of the Four Horsemen of Notre Dame
who beat Stanford 27-10 in the Rose Bowl game of 1925, is now coach
ing Forclham, intersectional opponent of St. Mary's this year. The Ford
ham Rams have rung up 109 points in two early games and are hailed
as the best in the Fast.
One of football's oldest traditional games will be revived this week when |
Cornell travels to Ann Arbor to face mighty Michigan, national champions j
under the Dickenson system figures last year. The two teams first met in ,
1889, and Cornell won, G6-0. Relations ended in 1917, and tomorrow's game j
will be the first since that date. Hamilton I

the Wildcats. Stanford and Northwestern possess a number of things in 1
common. First of all they both employ the Warner system, or at least a f
modified Warner system. Hanley shoots in a number of single wing forma- 1
| tions just as Thornhill has been doing this season. Both teams have more j
than the usual number of sophomores in the starting line-up, and both ace
said to be fast but green.
If Bobby Grayson gets away for some goodly gains tomorrow, the
spectators in Soldier's Field may be reminded of their famed halfback,
"Pug" Renter. We never had the privilege of seeing that dynamic gentle
man play, except through tlifc dubious medium of the news reel. But in
one flash we saw Renter get off around left end for a 24-yard gain against
Ohio State. The thing nearest to that picture of Rentner that we've seen |
was Bobby Grayson pounding straight down the field in rugby, shaking
tacklers loose, never swerving from that dead course ahead.
Ouch! Who said that the loss of Smith and Brown would cripple the 1
Trojan forward wall? We have just come across statistics of the Washing
j ton State-Southern California game and we learned that W.S.C. gained
just 48 yards from scrimmage through that S.C. line. And Warburton,
I Griffith, Howard, et. al., picked up a mere 434 yards from the Cougars.
When Ho war Harpster was an Ail-American for Carnegie Tech, he
was touted as one of the greatest of forward passers. Now,- as the youthful
! coach of his Alma Mater, Harpster has built a deadly aeriel attack, with j
I which his Skibos buried "Pop" Warner's up-and-coming Temple Owls
| last week.
"Sleepy Jimmy" Crowley, one of the Four Horsemen of Notre Dame
who beat Stanford 27-10 in the Rose Bowl game of 1925, is now coach
ing Forclham, intersectional opponent of St. Mary's this year. The Ford
ham Rams have rung up 109 points in two early games and are hailed
as the best in the Fast.
One of football's oldest traditional games will be revived this week when |
Cornell travels to Ann Arbor to face mighty Michigan, national champions j
under the Dickenson system figures last year. The two teams first met in ,
1889, and Cornell won, G6-0. Relations ended in 1917, and tomorrow's game j
will be the first since that date. Hamilton I
Saturday's game at Soldier's Field in Chicago promises to be a repeti
tion of the Santa Clara-Stanford game i! Coach Mauley's printed inten
tions to make the game a passing battle is true. lianJey has two excellent
passers in his quarterbacks, Olson and Auguston, and a real pass receiver j
in his veteran end, Manske. The contest offers another parallel to last
week in that Hanley, just as Clipper Smith, is counting heavily on kick
ing to jam the Cards into the hole and keep them there for the duration
of the game. Northwestern's man Olson is reputed the best punter in
the Big Ten.
Well, Indians Maentz and Alustiza leveled things up against Paglia, and '
