### Millard Browne 
The largest basketball squad ever
enrolled at Stanford University has
been working out three times a
week in the Indian pavilion under
Coach John Bunn.
Forty-live are trying out for
varsity positions, and almost as
many freshman candidates have
reported. Bunn was forced to
turn down several varsity nomi
neers because of lack of facilities.
TlVs year's team will have only i
two lettermen as a nucleus. Captain {
Hal Edelen, center, and Keith Top- i
ping, forward, played regularly dur- ;
ing ihe 1932-33 season. Edelen is al
ready out for the indoor sport, but
Topping, a gridman, will wait until
the football schedule is completed. I
Four members of last year's
Stanford reserves —Palmer, Fuller, j
A1 Page, and Charles Rogers—have
been working in nicely this fall, and
they look like possible first string j
material. Herb Jenkins, who played j
for the Card frosh three years ago, j
has returned with his six feet four i
inches after an extended leave of 1
absence.
Of (lie 1932 freshmen who were
the first Stanford yearlings ever
to defeat the California team j
three times successively, only two
regulars are out for varsity now.
They are Dave Farber, 'a clever
guard, and George Viquie, an ac
curate shooting forward.
Practice will be held only tri- !
weekly until the close of freshman j
football season; scrimmages with
outside competition will be sched- i
uled shortly after this time. Inter
squad scrimmage will start in two
weeks.
It is estimated that women own
40 per cent of this country's wealth.
