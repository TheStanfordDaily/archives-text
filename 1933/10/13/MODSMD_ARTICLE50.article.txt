# INDIAN KICKERS TO MEET S.F.U.
## 
### 
With a starting combination that
has been well scrambled since their
opening game with San Jose State,
Stanford's varsity soccer men will
take the field against SF.U. tomor
row. The game begins at 10:30
o'clock in the morning and will be
played on the varsity field.
Loss of Walker and Kennedy, a
pair of capable halfbacks, will |
hamper the development in that
department, but Johnny Moore,
all-Conference half of two years ;
ago, has turned out and will start j
the game at center half. Rudy
Gon/ales is playing right half, and J
Hitchcock opens the game at left j
half in place of Waddy White, who
lias been unavailable this past
week.
Captain Carl Knecht has been
moved to center forward, while all-
Conference man .Art Hearn is tak
ing the left wing. The forward line I
composed of Johnson, Knecht and
Hearn with Gomez at right wing,
and Doddington inside, performed
smoothly in practice last evening.
Lewis and Strou.se, fullbacks, and
Jack King, goalie, complete the
team. ' ,
