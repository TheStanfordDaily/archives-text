# TROJANS, INDIANS GET SPOTLIGHT IN WEEK-END GAMES
## Other Coast Games Feature U.C., Olympic Club 
### Frank Tremaine 
i Pacific Coast football holds the na
j tion's spotlight this week-end with
three western teams playing in tv/o
of tomorrow's most important tilts.
At Chicago, undefeated, untied, un
. scored-on Stanford meets North
western, Big Ten * luminary, while
St. Mary's will attempt to ruin
U.S.C.'s title hopes in their game at
Angeles.
The Gael-Trojan battle is a
"natural" among sports events. It
was the Marauding Moragans who
last defeated Southern California
in the first game of the 1931 sea
son after which Troy embarked
! on a winning streak which lias run
to 25 consecutive games.
In addition St. Mary's was knocked
out of the fight for the national title
in a one-point upset by California
last Saturday and are primed to ad
minister a dose of the same medi
cine to U.S.C. Although the Trojans
are favorites tomorrow, many are
of the opinion that the Gaels will
come out with the long end of the
score.
The Southern California-St.
Mary's game brings together two of
the heaviest teams in football. At
the beginning of the season the Gael
line averaged 214 pounds, although
it is slightly under that figure now
with Schaeffer replacing the injured
Gilbert at guard.
Although defeated by lowa, 7 to
0 in their first game, Northwest
ern is still rated one of the threats
of the Big Ten and with two
weeks of rest, the game with the
train-weary Indians can only be
called a toss-up.
California, fresh from her sur
prising victory over St. Mary's meets
Ihe -Olympic Club tomorrow, pre
pared to show doubters her per
formance against the Gaels was no
flash on the pan. Reedy and Kee
fer, two men instrumental in the
final touchdown march a week
will open in the Bear backfield.
Huskies Doubtful
Up at Seattle, doubtful Washing
ton has its first test of the year
meeting Prince Callison's veteran
team from Oregon. With 22 letter
men on the squad headed by hard
hitting Mike Mikaluk, the Orange
men have probably the most expe
rienced team on the Coast. Critics
rate Washington well up on the list
of western teams, but Jimmy Phe
lan bemoans his material and looks
for a bad year. Last year's game
ended in a scoreless tie.
The Oregon State-S.F.U. set-to at
Kezar Stadium should be a tight
affair with the Dons gunning for
their first victory after losing to
Nevada and holding St. Mary's to a
7 to 0 win. Washington State should
run rough-shod over weak Mon
tana.
