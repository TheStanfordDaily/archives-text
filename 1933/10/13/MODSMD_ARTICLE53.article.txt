### BY DICK STROUSE 
Graciously agreeing to enjoy a '
1.000-mile pleasure trip, the British
Columbia Rugby Union conden
scended Tuesday night to send a
| representative rugger team to the
Bay region early in March. Purposes
| and possible by-products of trip: as
sistance in the Stanford reincarna- !
{tion of a suddenly mobile cox-pse;
| realization of eternal dreams of
I Stanford's rugby-conscious Harry j
! Maloney; engaging in rugby games; j
possible swelling, of thinned B.A.C.
! coffers.
Complementary and complimen
| tary to Stanford-California hoot
ers' voyage to Seattle and Vancou
| ver (leaving evening of December ;
21, return January 3), Canadian ]
clouters will play at Palo Alto, Ber
-1 keley, San Francisco. Fifteen hun- ;
j died dollars—equal to amount guar
' anteed Malonevmen by Canadian j
hosts-to-be—has been promised Ca- |
nucks by Farm and Campanile

campi.
Accentuating the corpse's sudden
mobility, James Newman (New Zea
land Rugby Union representative)
returned to Oceania recently, pleased
with Maloney rugby, not distressed
with 3,000-mile journey, promising
to recommend a Stanford tour to
Australia and New Zealand in the
American summer, Polynesian win
ter of 1934. Removing 20 Stanford
ruggers from heat, lowan relatives,
suddenly sentimental collegiate visi
tors of California summers, the trip
would last from June 22 to the mid
dled' September.
When gridirons (football fields)
are empty, luckier gridmen not in
hospital, sports pages occupied with
spring baseball in November, rugby
will begin at Stanford. Maloney,
manager of the combined Indian-
Bear team, will with Eddie Graff of
U.C. choose hardest-blocking, long
est-kicking, toughest Stanford and

California ruggers (probably en
tirely from football and soccer
squads; certainly from scholastically
eligible students); form a combined
team; spend Xmas vacation in Can
ada.
