(Editor's note: This is the third
and last of a series of articles
which are being run in the Daily
\icwing opinions of Stanford pro
fessors and others on the subject
of Germany's "blacklisted books.")
Since blacklisting and censorship
of any sort is looked upon with sus
picion and distrust in the United
States, it is not surprising that Ger
many's recent action in blacklisting
books by some 200 authors and mak
ing a public demonstration of the
burning of these volumes should
cause much attention.
This interest has led library au
thorities to place on exhibit 16 of
the best known of the '"blacklist"
group in the show cases directly
outside the Hoover War Library.
With each of these books is an ex
planation why the volume was cen
sored.
The past two articles in this se
ries has well shown the general
American feeling toward Germany's
censorship drive. Ralph H. Lutz,
piofessor of History and chairman
of the directors of the Hoover War
Library, has furnished the German
viewpoint as expressed in Germany.
Lutz, himself, says, "I am nat
urally opposed to such blacklist
ing or censorship." He went on,
however, to explain that "the of
ficial explanation of the German
policy is exemplified in Musso
lini's statement, 'book and rifle—
these are my command.'"
Lutz further said that the best
German explanation was issued in
the form of a declaration by the
Prussian Ministry of Science, Arts,
and Popular Education. This was
applied to all state libraries and is
here given in part:
"The struggle is directed against
symptoms of disintegration in our
form-bound way of thinking and
living—that is to say, 'asphalt lit
erature,' most of which is written
for people who live in big cities . . .

| This form of literature is written '
1 chiefly but not entirely by Jews."
"More important than the purifi
i cation is the sound construction of
i the New Germany. Patriotic clap
trap does not enter into sound con
! struction of a nationalist and so
j cialist nature. The black lists will
ban that kind of thing too."

German explanation was issued in
the form of a declaration by the
Prussian Ministry of Science, Arts,
and Popular Education. This was
applied to all state libraries and is
here given in part:
"The struggle is directed against
symptoms of disintegration in our
form-bound way of thinking and
living—that is to say, 'asphalt lit
erature,' most of which is written
for people who live in big cities . . .

| This form of literature is written '
1 chiefly but not entirely by Jews."
"More important than the purifi
i cation is the sound construction of
i the New Germany. Patriotic clap
trap does not enter into sound con
! struction of a nationalist and so
j cialist nature. The black lists will
ban that kind of thing too."
