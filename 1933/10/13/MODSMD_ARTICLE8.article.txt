N.R.A. authority is meeting ob
stacles. Coal operators in Ky. re
fused to attend an arbitration, New
Rochello employers refused to take
down Eagles as ordered by John

refused to heed the labor board. No
action has been taken, and officials
are plenty worried.
Agricultural codes are being for- j
mulated, and four more codes were j
approved by Roosevelt.
