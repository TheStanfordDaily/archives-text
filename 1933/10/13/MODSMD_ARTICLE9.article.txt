# Student Heads Urge Complete Sellout of S. C. Tickets Today
## Prospects of Large Section Seem Remote as Few Tickets Are Sold BIG GAME SEATS LEFT Sale Will Continue Today From 9-12; 1-5 
### John Kline 
Today, Friday the 13th, is the last
i day of rooters' ticket sale for both
the S.C. and California football
games—and despite the unlucky sig
nificance usually attached to such
a day, this must be a big one in
Stanford rooting history, student
leaders pointed out last night.
Few Sold
With tickets sold for the Trojan
game section standing at the piti
fully low figure of 379, and the
i section for the U.C. game boasting
! little better than 721 seats, stu
dent pep-inspiring leaders face
the annoying prospect of the
j smallest rooting group in recent
Stanford history— at a time when
i the chances of "playing horse
I with U.S.C." are at their best,
j Rally Committee, once hopeful of
j 2,000, is now hoping that it can at
| least bring forth 1,300 to match the
j.section which cheered bravely—al
j beit vainly—for a Cardinal victory
in 1931 in Los Angeles. Stanford's
1933 "steam-roller," one of the coun
try's few unscored-upon teams, is
certain to make gridiron history
against the always-strong Trojans.
In urging a large turnout, Chief
Rally Committeeman Beaubare
stated: "We ought to l>e proud of
i Stanford's 1933 varsity. And we're
; going to show that feeling with a
j full rooting section at the S.C.
! contest. Let's buy those tickets
j now!"
Ticket dispensing quarters in the
I A.S.S.U. office will be open from 9
until 12 and 1 to 5 o'clock for the
FINAL day's sale.
Presentation of student body
cards is requisite to buy the $1.10
| admittance ducats to the game
! .scheduled for Los Angeles' Memo
j rial Stadium on Armistice Day, No
! vcmber 11.
Simultaneous sale is being eon
j ducted for the annual Big Game
with California, to be held in Stan
' ford Stadium, with rooters' seats
j selling for $1.65. Preferred seats for
j parents and friends are attainable
|by students also. Four per student
at $4 apiece for the Cal. game; six
at $3.30 each for the Trojan encoun
ter. These tickets are definitely bet
ter than those to be offered later at
public sale.
Ever anxious to make the student
year a success in every respect,
A.S.S.U. President Jerry Traut
man last night spoke his mind in
j no uncertain terms: "It is the
| duty of all loyal members of the
| A.S.S.U. to support the Stanford
I team at all times. As president, 1
j ask that every member of the stu
dent body who can. purchase root
| crs' tickets now and be in L.A. for
! the game.
Student Manager Les Hables fol
{ lowed up by pointing out that: "We
j have a good rate for transportation
j and hotel accommodations. The ma-
I jority of students should find it pos
i .sible to be in L.A. for the game. Buy
I your rooters' tickets now and get
I On the Boat' to beat S.C."
B.A.C. Sales Manager Jake Ir
| win said, in regard to the sale itself:
I "Student tickets must be purchased
{ by tonight for both the California
1 and U.S.C. games. Any student who
[ is undecided as to whether he will
be able to attend either game should
iprotect himself by purchasing tickets
la's they are returnable until the Sat
| urday preceding each game.
"The sales cannot be held open
any longer than tonight at 5 o'clock
| as it is imperative that our printing
j orders be in at once for any tickets
j which we want printed. If we are
j not certain of students purchasing
I their rooters' tickets we must reprint
i them as regular tickets and allot
