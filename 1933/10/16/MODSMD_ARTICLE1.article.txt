World statesmen, shellshocked,
flabbergasted by the Hitler thunder
bolt from across the Alps, faced
with the scare-word of diplomacy,
"impasse," yesterday voted to tem
porarily adjourn the Geneva Arms
conference. Instructions are awaited
from home offices.
While the group of confab stal
warts were groping blindly for a
.sufficiently stinging reply to the
German message, government heads
mumbled confusedly about the pos
sibilities of war, withheld official
comment.
Capitals were frankly stunned,
alarmed:
PAIIIS. — Tightlippcd deputies
waited for cabinet comment, saw
war as inevitable unless a means
of conciliation could be found,
knew «>f no means. War-conscious
Frenchmen rallied to the support
of the Daladier government.
LONDON.—CaIm Britishers felt
"that war is a good way off"; found
ii close enough to make Henderson
forget his 4 o'clock tea, caused Mac-
Donald to desert his week-end
Chequers for Downing street.
WASHINGTO N.—Uncle Sam
agrees that the Conference recess is
a good thing, depends upon Norman
Davis to "cover" new developments,
says nothing to indicate a definite
American policy.
ROME.—AII the doors are not |
shut by Hitler's action. Mussolini j
may emerge as a go-between.
MOSCOW. — The Soviet Bear ;
grinned, growled out good humor- j
edly that the U.S.S.R. "intends to
continue its efforts toward real dis
aimament."
Hut in Berlin no one was in a
stupor; "election" machinery was
humming, stored-up plans for the
closer consolidation of the Reich
were progressing rapidly. The
Chancellor cocked his ears for
world opinion.
Excitable French journals vied
with each other in grinding out most i
unfavorable interpretations of Ger
many's sudden double withdrawal;
from Conference and League. The
choicest comment: "Germany wants
war! Are we to wail passively while
she prepares?"
