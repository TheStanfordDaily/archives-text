# Cotton Strikers Cry For Wage Increase
## "Daily" Men See Need for Radical Overhauling Of Pay Scale in San Joaquin Cotton Belt 
### BY NEWS DIGESTERS 
EDITOR'S NOTE: News Digesters, unsatisfied with Associated Press
reports of the labor disorders, encouraged in their dissatisfaction by the
Editor, have acted. To the battle scene they went, saw, wrote. Result
follows:

In the strike-ridden San Joaquin
cotton belt things outwardly seem
usual; the unusual passes unnoticed.
But the situation is loaded with dy
namite which may explode at any
moment along a front from Kern to
Fresno counties.

Federal and State authorities have
stepped in, arc attempting to settle;
their announced success yesterday
has been denounced by strike lead
ers. Reason: strikers are asked to
go back to work at the same wage,
60 cents per hundredweight for cot
ton picked, while Governor Rolph's
mediation board attempts to iron
out their difficulties. Strike leaders
say as long as any remain out of
jail, they will continue to demand a
living wage, not one which must be
supplemented by Federal relief. A
similar settlement has already failed
in Arizona.
In Tulare we saw the funeral
procession of Davila and Hernan
dez, shot by armed growers in
Pixley. Two thousand strikers
followed the coffins, marched in
disciplined, military formation.
Highway police acted as a guard
of honor. At the graves leaders
addressed the men, women, and
children, demanded they carry on
in memory of their departed com
panions who died to improve liv
ing conditions for workers.
The pickers are mostly quartered
in camps. The largest at Corcoran
has 3,800 who live in tents, sur
rounded by all their ragged worldly
goods, including gasless automo
biles, tireless trailers. Their disci
pline is remarkable. A few intelli
gent whites seem to have organized
the peon majority into a military
organization.
Around the camp march sentinels
armed with staves; strikers enter
and LEAVE freely, but, as soon as
outsiders approach, the pickets
gather, question.
Despite lack of running water,
electricity, all comforts, the sani
tary conditions of the crowded
camps are good; there is practi
cally no sickness, but food lacks.
Four children have died from
MALNUTRITION. The state, how
ever, is beginning to supply food
stuffs.
It must be emphasized the strik
ers evidently are not coerced; they
may leave the camps or enter as
they will.
The whole issue is whether grow
ers can pay more than 60 cents per
hundredweight to pickei's and
whether these can live on the pres
ent wage.
Claim the growers: 70 per cent of
their crops have been sold on fu
tures only one cent higher than last
years yet wages this year are 30 per
ccnt higher. Their farms are mort
gaged, their taxes unpaid.
Say they: the picker family earns
$2.50 a day, is furnished housing,
light, water. The unrest is due to
agitation by non-NRA industrial
union, not by working conditions.
The union is a racket; the two-bit
dues are insufficient to support its
present activities; therefore, it re
ceives communist support. Illiterate
Mexican workers arc led by the nose
by radical whites; this is really a
yearly problem. True: that though
some large, efficient ranches make
money, most live from hand to
mouth, many are down and out. Al
most all insist they cannot pay
more.
Pickers claim: they do not re
ceive a living wage. That to exist
a whole family must work; this
makes family life impossible. That
the rise in cotton has not reflected
in their wages—still at the pov
erty level. That planters look on

| them as mere chattels and will
not bargain.
That NRA recognizes workers'
right to bargain collectively and
raise wages. That their leaders are
j arrested, confined so that they have
difficulty in negotiating. Example:
J Pat Chambers, principal leader, who
I has been slapped in under almost
every conceivable charge. THAT
! ONE - SIDED JUSTICE FAVORS
TAX PAYING GROWERS, NOT
i TRANSIENT PICKERS.
Immediate causes that lead to
strife were: the planters' idea that
workers were chattels; the hot
! headedness among \growers and
pickers alike; desperation slowly
rising from non-living wages; the
refusal of growers to recognize or
deal with the pickers' union; and,
lastly, not leastly, the criminal stu
| pidity of local authorities who is
jsued gun-toting permits to growers
by the bushel basketful. This pre
cipitated butchery—the Pixley mas
sacre where an armed mob shot
down three pickers in cold blood!
As the situation now stands any
| thing can happen. Pickers refuse
I to work at the old rate, refuse to re
' turn 'till settlement is reached with
| the union.
Eviction from any of the five
c?mps would result in another
Washington B.E.F. Hundreds would
: be turned out with no place to go
i except the highways. A hundred
highway police, a virtual national
guard, patrol the region.
It would take only some rash
person on either side to set off
i the dynamite. Such is apt to be
j the result if the county authori
ties' plan for eviction on Tuesday
for "sanitary reasons" takes ef
fect. An eruption almost oc
j curred Saturday at an exhibition
of the four-day-old body of a
murdered Pixley striker.
Sensing the seriousness of the dis
! pute, government conciliators ap
• pear to be rushing settlement re
! gardless of consequences. Their de
cision, they claim, is final. Their
j decision of Saturday has already
beer rejected.
The whole situation probably
I proves that radical overhauling of
the state's agricultural labor wages
[ is needed before any lasting cflec't
' can be realized.

Federal and State authorities have

their announced success yesterday
has been denounced by strike lead

go back to work at the same wage,
60 cents per hundredweight for cot
ton picked, while Governor Rolph's
mediation board attempts to iron

say as long as any remain out of

living wage, not one which must be
supplemented by Federal relief. A
similar settlement has already failed
in Arizona.
In Tulare we saw the funeral
procession of Davila and Hernan

The pickers are mostly quartered
in camps. The largest at Corcoran
has 3,800 who live in tents, sur

EDITOR'S NOTE: News Digesters, unsatisfied with Associated Press
reports of the labor disorders, encouraged in their dissatisfaction by the
Editor, have acted. To the battle scene they went, saw, wrote. Result
follows:

In the strike-ridden San Joaquin
cotton belt things outwardly seem
usual; the unusual passes unnoticed.
But the situation is loaded with dy
namite which may explode at any
moment along a front from Kern to
Fresno counties.

Federal and State authorities have
stepped in, arc attempting to settle;
their announced success yesterday
has been denounced by strike lead
ers. Reason: strikers are asked to
go back to work at the same wage,
60 cents per hundredweight for cot
ton picked, while Governor Rolph's
mediation board attempts to iron
out their difficulties. Strike leaders
say as long as any remain out of
jail, they will continue to demand a
living wage, not one which must be
supplemented by Federal relief. A
similar settlement has already failed
in Arizona.
In Tulare we saw the funeral
procession of Davila and Hernan
dez, shot by armed growers in
Pixley. Two thousand strikers
followed the coffins, marched in
disciplined, military formation.
Highway police acted as a guard
of honor. At the graves leaders
addressed the men, women, and
children, demanded they carry on
in memory of their departed com
panions who died to improve liv
ing conditions for workers.
The pickers are mostly quartered
in camps. The largest at Corcoran
has 3,800 who live in tents, sur
rounded by all their ragged worldly
goods, including gasless automo
biles, tireless trailers. Their disci
pline is remarkable. A few intelli
gent whites seem to have organized
the peon majority into a military
organization.
Around the camp march sentinels
armed with staves; strikers enter
and LEAVE freely, but, as soon as
outsiders approach, the pickets
gather, question.
Despite lack of running water,
electricity, all comforts, the sani
tary conditions of the crowded
camps are good; there is practi
cally no sickness, but food lacks.
Four children have died from
MALNUTRITION. The state, how
ever, is beginning to supply food
stuffs.
It must be emphasized the strik
ers evidently are not coerced; they
may leave the camps or enter as
they will.
The whole issue is whether grow
ers can pay more than 60 cents per
hundredweight to pickei's and
whether these can live on the pres
ent wage.
Claim the growers: 70 per cent of
their crops have been sold on fu
tures only one cent higher than last
years yet wages this year are 30 per
ccnt higher. Their farms are mort
gaged, their taxes unpaid.
Say they: the picker family earns
$2.50 a day, is furnished housing,
light, water. The unrest is due to
agitation by non-NRA industrial
union, not by working conditions.
The union is a racket; the two-bit
dues are insufficient to support its
present activities; therefore, it re
ceives communist support. Illiterate
Mexican workers arc led by the nose
by radical whites; this is really a
yearly problem. True: that though
some large, efficient ranches make
money, most live from hand to
mouth, many are down and out. Al
most all insist they cannot pay
more.
Pickers claim: they do not re
ceive a living wage. That to exist
a whole family must work; this
makes family life impossible. That
the rise in cotton has not reflected
in their wages—still at the pov
erty level. That planters look on

| them as mere chattels and will
not bargain.
That NRA recognizes workers'
right to bargain collectively and
raise wages. That their leaders are
j arrested, confined so that they have
difficulty in negotiating. Example:
J Pat Chambers, principal leader, who
I has been slapped in under almost
every conceivable charge. THAT
! ONE - SIDED JUSTICE FAVORS
TAX PAYING GROWERS, NOT
i TRANSIENT PICKERS.
Immediate causes that lead to
strife were: the planters' idea that
workers were chattels; the hot
! headedness among \growers and
pickers alike; desperation slowly
rising from non-living wages; the
refusal of growers to recognize or
deal with the pickers' union; and,
lastly, not leastly, the criminal stu
| pidity of local authorities who is
jsued gun-toting permits to growers
by the bushel basketful. This pre
cipitated butchery—the Pixley mas
sacre where an armed mob shot
down three pickers in cold blood!
As the situation now stands any
| thing can happen. Pickers refuse
I to work at the old rate, refuse to re
' turn 'till settlement is reached with
| the union.
Eviction from any of the five
c?mps would result in another
Washington B.E.F. Hundreds would
: be turned out with no place to go
i except the highways. A hundred
highway police, a virtual national
guard, patrol the region.
It would take only some rash
person on either side to set off
i the dynamite. Such is apt to be
j the result if the county authori
ties' plan for eviction on Tuesday
for "sanitary reasons" takes ef
fect. An eruption almost oc
