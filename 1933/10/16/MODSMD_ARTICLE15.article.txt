# ROBERT BUNS TO TAKE LEAD IN "THE CRITIC"
## Nearly 30 Campus Actors Chosen for Cast Of Satirical Reading 
### James Sandoe 
"The Critic," Sword and Sandals'
satirical leading featuring a well
chosen cast of about 30 actors, nine
tenths of whom are campus talent,
and led by Robert A. Brauns in the
head role of Puff, is scheduled for
production early in November by
the Palo Alto Community Players.
A little over a year and a half
ago a large-eyed, tan-skinned fel
low made a remarkable impression
as Peter, the dullard servant in
"Romeo and Juliet." Later he played
a bit in the sadly satirico-sentimen
tal "Parade."
Sinks into Obscurity
Then for a time Brauns sank into
undrstmatic obscurity insofar as the
campus was concerned, although he
played frequently in Palo Alto pro
ductions—until he read the difficult
role of Puff in the Sword and San
dals' production of Richard Brins
ley Sheridan's "The Critic; or, A
Tragedy Rehears'd."
W. Eraser Rae, English critic
and biographer of Sheridan, has
written, "The success of 'The
Critic' depends upon the part of
Mr. Puff being filled by an actor
of remarkable and peculiar tal
ent." Thus, the success of this
production will rest with Brauns
in, at least, a very considerable
measure.
But he is by no means the only,
important character in the play. Mr.
Dangle, citizen-dabbler in the thea
tre arts, is to be portrayed by James
Broughton. Myna Hughes who, in
addition to fine work on the Stan
ford stage, has been of great as
sistance in many of the Sword and
Sandals readings, will be Mrs. Dan
gle, his justifiably annoyed wife.
Marian Jones, whose campus rec
ord includes a picture of Millamant
in' Congreve's "The Way of the
World," as well as one of Linda
Senton, the heroine of "Holiday,"
will exercise lungs and arms elabo
rately as Tilburina, comic queen of
Puff's "Tragedy Rehears'd." An
drews Harris, lately escaped from
Rally Committee duty, has fallen
into the clutches of this play's re
morseless director and is already
demonstrating an ability at thun
derous sorrow as Don Ferolo Whis
ker an dos.
In the play within "The Critic,"
Henry Brill, who played a minor
role in "An Enemy of the People,"
v/ill be seen, as will campus Com
munist and poet, Matthew Evans.
Others in the cast include Enid
Olivi, Will Williams, Robert Balzar,
Packy MacFarland, Curt Zimansky,
Robert Place, Neal Berry, Powell
Ownby, June Birohard, A1 Bogan,
Dick Dawson, Sally Lane, Jane
Cooke, nearly all of them known
for various local stage appearances.

will exercise lungs and arms elabo
rately as Tilburina, comic queen of

In the play within "The Critic,"
Henry Brill, who played a minor

Robert Place, Neal Berry, Powell

for various local stage appearances.
"The Critic," Sword and Sandals'
satirical leading featuring a well
chosen cast of about 30 actors, nine
tenths of whom are campus talent,
and led by Robert A. Brauns in the
head role of Puff, is scheduled for
production early in November by
the Palo Alto Community Players.
A little over a year and a half
ago a large-eyed, tan-skinned fel
low made a remarkable impression
as Peter, the dullard servant in
"Romeo and Juliet." Later he played
a bit in the sadly satirico-sentimen
tal "Parade."
Sinks into Obscurity
Then for a time Brauns sank into
undrstmatic obscurity insofar as the
campus was concerned, although he
played frequently in Palo Alto pro
ductions—until he read the difficult
role of Puff in the Sword and San
dals' production of Richard Brins
ley Sheridan's "The Critic; or, A
Tragedy Rehears'd."
W. Eraser Rae, English critic
and biographer of Sheridan, has
written, "The success of 'The
Critic' depends upon the part of
Mr. Puff being filled by an actor
of remarkable and peculiar tal
ent." Thus, the success of this
production will rest with Brauns
in, at least, a very considerable
measure.
But he is by no means the only,
important character in the play. Mr.
Dangle, citizen-dabbler in the thea
tre arts, is to be portrayed by James
Broughton. Myna Hughes who, in
addition to fine work on the Stan
ford stage, has been of great as
sistance in many of the Sword and
Sandals readings, will be Mrs. Dan
gle, his justifiably annoyed wife.
