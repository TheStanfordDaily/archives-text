# Less College Guzzling After Repeal: Reynolds
## 
### 
Collegiate drinking will be more
moderate, less psychological, pre
dicted Sociology Professor Charles
N. Reynolds when questioned on
what kind of a hang-over the
Eighteenth Amendment will leave
when it terminates its hectic career
December (5.
"There is a tendency in colleges
to drink with somewhat of a flour
ish," said he. "When students don't
have to break the law, they will
he more moderate."
Reynolds declared undergraduate
drinking more widespread than
when he was a student at the Uni
versity of Oregon some 20 years ago.
Questioned on the sociological ef
fect of repeal, he said there would
probably be a temporary period of
chaos when graft-loving politicians
will find a liquor conscious public
easy prey.
"The situation will be worse in
states where there is no uniformity
between majority opinion and local
liquor laws. This period of adjust

]mentis unfortunate as it will disil
lusion many who believe repeal a
cure-all for racketeering."
Reynolds predicts a great decrease
in bootlegging and considers Ameri
can public opinion strong enough to
prevent the return of the old-fash
ioned saloon.
Tin- legal technicalities of repeal
machinery were explained by
Dean Marion Kirkwood of the law
school.
On November 7, six more states
will vote on the repeal issue. Only
three of these are necessary to corn
j plete the necessary 36. Probably all
of these stales will hold conventions
1 on December 6 to ratify the meas
ure, but the first three to send their
certificate to the Secretary of State
will completely repeal the amend
i ment."
Kirkwood thinks il likely that ad
ditional states will hold a vote on
the issue after the necessary num
i her has been reached, in order to
(definitely show their attitude.
