After completing ;t plan to open !
np (lie semi-liquid but closed banks j
in the country by lending them 1
about $1,000,000,000, to be taken j
from RFC funds, F.R. last night re
marked over the radio that the U.S.
cannot possibly take care of the
needy relief. It is up to ;
the individual localities.
Al the same time plans were being j
forwarded to spend about $8,000,-
000,000 (eight billions) for housingj
nation's unfortunates.
