Mi.ss Louise Price, new director
of (lie Union unit for women, says

She says: "As I see it, I think the

probably make the sororities more

Miss Price added that junior

comfortable, and because many

rority life, the possibility of being
kft out docs not bother the trans
it is as much as might be imagined.
Dean of Women Mary Yost said
that it was too soon to express an
opinion, as the women had not yet
had a chance to discuss the ques
tion, but that it will be more com
