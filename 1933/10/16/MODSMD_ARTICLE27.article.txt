# NORTHWESTERN STOPS INDIANS IN 0-0 BUTTLE
## Stanford Nearly Succeeds In Three Different Scoring Tries WILDCATS OUTKICKED Cards Intercept Five Of Opponents' Passes 
### Spud Hamilton 
They tossed a Wildcat and an In
dian into the stadium at Soldiers'
I Field in Chicago Saturday and 35,-
j 000 people hung around to see the
1 fur fly. The Wildcat clawed ineffec
: lively at the Indian and the Indian
; made a few amiable passes at the
j cat with his • tomahawk but both
| were rescued from the melee, un-
I scathed. In plainer terms, it was
I Northwestern 0, Stanford 0, and the
| 35,000 who had come to view a fc-
I rocious tangle were disappointed.
| It was quite an overturning of
the dope, which had consistently
underrated the Northwestern team
and overrated the Stanford men.
! In offensive play, where the Red
was popularly supposed to excel,
j Northwestern rang up nine first
! downs to their Opponents' six.
Olson Outkicked
In kicking, whereat Northwest
j em's famed Ollie Olson was consid
| ercd about the best in the Big Ten,
| Stanford was way out in front, av
| eraging 42 yards against the Wild-
I cats' 34.
Northwcstcrn's edge in yardage
and first downs was nullified by
j Stanford's kicking which amount
ed to a total of 120 yards gained
j by punts. The alert Stanford de
fense against passes throttled scv
| eral Wildcat attacks before they
| got fairly under way. Five of
I the twelve heaves attempted by
| Northwestern were intercepted.
Despite Stanford's lack of power
j on offense they :rutheir share of
\ the breaks and three times nar
rowly missed a touchdown. Their
j first bid came in the second quarter
! after Sim had taken one of Olson's
passes and raced back 25 yards to
the Wildcat 35.
Ilillman Passes
After fiddling around on several
plays, Hillman drove a pass from
the 30 - yard line to Afflerbaugh
standing in the clear on the goal
line. But it was simply not Afifler
i baugh's turn, and the ball popped
j out of his arms like a Mexican
I jumping bean, much to the relief of
i the Northwestern stands.
Again near the close of the
i quarter when Alustiza had just
! replaced Hillman to repulse a
! Northwestern drive, Alustiza
kicked 50 yards to Lecper on the
Northwestern 25, and on the next
play Reynolds and Moscrip broke
through to recover a loose* ball,
j With only two minutes of play in
! the half remaining, Stanford wasted
| time on two fruitless plays and then
got going. Sim crashed nine yards
to the eleven-yard mark and Reis
| ner picked up a yard and a first
] down for the Cardinal. Sim went
I wide on the next play, trying des
j perately to score, 'but he could only
| make it to the two-yard line and
I with time for one more play, the
| "Bounding Basque," Alustiza, hit
j into a stone barrier at center.
Sim Quick-kicks
Stanford opened the second half
like champions and it seemed for a
while that Thornhill had really
turned on the heat. Sim immedi
ately put the Big Ten men in a hole
| with a 64-yard quick-kick that went
!to Northwestern's 6-yard line. Ol-
I .
| son kicked back to his own 40 and
| then they turned Grayson loose on
! two plays. He made five yards, and
i again, ten yards and a first down.
Sim got four in two attempts, and
then Maentz got by Manske for the
first time in the afternoon, going to
I the 14-yard line. The "Ole Red
Buggy" stalled there, and when
Corbus tried a pass from place-kick
formation, the ball went wild into
i the end zone.

Thereafter Stanford threatened no
more, but ihe Wildcats twice pcne
j trated inside the Stanford 30, where
[ they were halted twice by intercep
tions of passes. Once they gained
| the 22 marker, when Corbus inter
cepted Olson's pass and Sim imme
diately quick-kicked 60 yards to the
i Wildcat 20.
Leeper returned to his 29, and on
j the next play broke away for 24
yards and advanced the ball to the
Stanford 45. This was the longest
' sustained march of the day and
ended only after 50 yards of the
I field had passed under the feet of
[ihe driving Wildcats.
Another interception, this time by
j O'Connor of Cruice's toss, choked
j this last advance and the two op
ponents finished the game conser
vatively, the ball clinging to mid
field.

; made a few amiable passes at the
j cat with his • tomahawk but both

| It was quite an overturning of
the dope, which had consistently
underrated the Northwestern team
and overrated the Stanford men.
! In offensive play, where the Red
was popularly supposed to excel,
j Northwestern rang up nine first
! downs to their Opponents' six.
Olson Outkicked
In kicking, whereat Northwest
j em's famed Ollie Olson was consid
| ercd about the best in the Big Ten,
| Stanford was way out in front, av
| eraging 42 yards against the Wild-
I cats' 34.
Northwcstcrn's edge in yardage
and first downs was nullified by
j Stanford's kicking which amount
ed to a total of 120 yards gained
j by punts. The alert Stanford de
fense against passes throttled scv
| eral Wildcat attacks before they
| got fairly under way. Five of
I the twelve heaves attempted by
| Northwestern were intercepted.
Despite Stanford's lack of power
j on offense they :rutheir share of
\ the breaks and three times nar
rowly missed a touchdown. Their
j first bid came in the second quarter
! after Sim had taken one of Olson's
passes and raced back 25 yards to
the Wildcat 35.
Ilillman Passes
After fiddling around on several
plays, Hillman drove a pass from
the 30 - yard line to Afflerbaugh
standing in the clear on the goal
line. But it was simply not Afifler
i baugh's turn, and the ball popped
j out of his arms like a Mexican
I jumping bean, much to the relief of
i the Northwestern stands.
Again near the close of the
i quarter when Alustiza had just
! replaced Hillman to repulse a
! Northwestern drive, Alustiza
kicked 50 yards to Lecper on the
Northwestern 25, and on the next
play Reynolds and Moscrip broke
through to recover a loose* ball,
j With only two minutes of play in
! the half remaining, Stanford wasted
| time on two fruitless plays and then
got going. Sim crashed nine yards
to the eleven-yard mark and Reis
| ner picked up a yard and a first
] down for the Cardinal. Sim went
I wide on the next play, trying des
j perately to score, 'but he could only
| make it to the two-yard line and
I with time for one more play, the
| "Bounding Basque," Alustiza, hit
j into a stone barrier at center.
Sim Quick-kicks
Stanford opened the second half
like champions and it seemed for a
while that Thornhill had really
turned on the heat. Sim immedi
ately put the Big Ten men in a hole
| with a 64-yard quick-kick that went
!to Northwestern's 6-yard line. Ol-
I .
| son kicked back to his own 40 and
| then they turned Grayson loose on
! two plays. He made five yards, and
i again, ten yards and a first down.
Sim got four in two attempts, and
then Maentz got by Manske for the
first time in the afternoon, going to
I the 14-yard line. The "Ole Red
Buggy" stalled there, and when
Corbus tried a pass from place-kick
formation, the ball went wild into
i the end zone.

Thereafter Stanford threatened no
more, but ihe Wildcats twice pcne
j trated inside the Stanford 30, where
[ they were halted twice by intercep
tions of passes. Once they gained
| the 22 marker, when Corbus inter
cepted Olson's pass and Sim imme
diately quick-kicked 60 yards to the
i Wildcat 20.
Leeper returned to his 29, and on
j the next play broke away for 24
yards and advanced the ball to the
Stanford 45. This was the longest
' sustained march of the day and
ended only after 50 yards of the
I field had passed under the feet of
[ihe driving Wildcats.
Another interception, this time by
j O'Connor of Cruice's toss, choked
j this last advance and the two op
ponents finished the game conser
vatively, the ball clinging to mid
field.

! downs to their Opponents' six.
Olson Outkicked
In kicking, whereat Northwest
j em's famed Ollie Olson was consid
| ercd about the best in the Big Ten,
| Stanford was way out in front, av
| eraging 42 yards against the Wild-
I cats' 34.
Northwcstcrn's edge in yardage
and first downs was nullified by
j Stanford's kicking which amount
ed to a total of 120 yards gained
j by punts. The alert Stanford de
fense against passes throttled scv
| eral Wildcat attacks before they
| got fairly under way. Five of
I the twelve heaves attempted by
| Northwestern were intercepted.
Despite Stanford's lack of power
j on offense they :rutheir share of
\ the breaks and three times nar
rowly missed a touchdown. Their
j first bid came in the second quarter
! after Sim had taken one of Olson's
passes and raced back 25 yards to
the Wildcat 35.
Ilillman Passes
After fiddling around on several
plays, Hillman drove a pass from
the 30 - yard line to Afflerbaugh
standing in the clear on the goal
line. But it was simply not Afifler
i baugh's turn, and the ball popped
j out of his arms like a Mexican
I jumping bean, much to the relief of
i the Northwestern stands.
Again near the close of the
i quarter when Alustiza had just
! replaced Hillman to repulse a
! Northwestern drive, Alustiza
kicked 50 yards to Lecper on the
Northwestern 25, and on the next
play Reynolds and Moscrip broke
through to recover a loose* ball,
j With only two minutes of play in
! the half remaining, Stanford wasted
| time on two fruitless plays and then
got going. Sim crashed nine yards
to the eleven-yard mark and Reis
| ner picked up a yard and a first
] down for the Cardinal. Sim went
I wide on the next play, trying des
j perately to score, 'but he could only
| make it to the two-yard line and
I with time for one more play, the
| "Bounding Basque," Alustiza, hit
j into a stone barrier at center.
Sim Quick-kicks
Stanford opened the second half
like champions and it seemed for a
while that Thornhill had really
turned on the heat. Sim immedi
ately put the Big Ten men in a hole
| with a 64-yard quick-kick that went
!to Northwestern's 6-yard line. Ol-
I .
| son kicked back to his own 40 and
| then they turned Grayson loose on
! two plays. He made five yards, and
i again, ten yards and a first down.
Sim got four in two attempts, and
then Maentz got by Manske for the
first time in the afternoon, going to
I the 14-yard line. The "Ole Red
Buggy" stalled there, and when
Corbus tried a pass from place-kick
formation, the ball went wild into
i the end zone.

Thereafter Stanford threatened no
more, but ihe Wildcats twice pcne
j trated inside the Stanford 30, where
[ they were halted twice by intercep
tions of passes. Once they gained
| the 22 marker, when Corbus inter
cepted Olson's pass and Sim imme
diately quick-kicked 60 yards to the
i Wildcat 20.
Leeper returned to his 29, and on
j the next play broke away for 24
yards and advanced the ball to the
Stanford 45. This was the longest
' sustained march of the day and
ended only after 50 yards of the
I field had passed under the feet of
[ihe driving Wildcats.
Another interception, this time by
j O'Connor of Cruice's toss, choked
j this last advance and the two op
ponents finished the game conser
vatively, the ball clinging to mid
field.
