# What Next?

J.nsl week, llio Daily prophesied Mini the Disarmament
Conference would smash. The Saturday smash was more
violent and more sudden than was contemplated, il must,
in frankness, he admitted. But the result is the same: il
has been proved that the European situation is so tensely
ragged that diplomats can no longer settle an important
question around the conference tahle.
That is an ugly statement, hut a true one. The former
allies may he able to gather together and force terms on
Germany, hut Hitler lias definitely refused to go along the
usual diplomatic channels.
The hulk of international publications, and the thick
maze of international bodies, treaties, and organizations
have blinded some; just as some were blinded in 191 1. The
blindness, however, is more widespread today because the
horror of the War still lingers as a gory memory. Our
legless, our gassed, our shell-shocked arc still with us in
suflicient quantities to remind us of that hell.
But what next? What have we to prevent a repetition
of 11)1 1? The League of Nations has now been definitely
relegated to the status of an interesting but almost useless
curiosity. The Japanese were peeved, so they left. The
Germans are peeved, so they have left. Il is only a matter
of time, it seems, till the League of Nations will be a pure
bit of historical refuse.
The Hitler week-end antics are the biggest fireworks
so far in a nation's policy that is being built on showman
ship. What can he think? Does he suppose that he will
be allowed to re-arm after marching thousands of well
drilled troops around and around before the quivering
French proboscis? Does he expect to re-arm with his hard
blowing ministers prating about a re-union of all German
peoples? Nationally, the leaving of the Conference was a
splendid move. It will show a crushed people that they
have a lighting messiah.
But internationally, what? Hitler cannot come back to
the Conference without losing face at home. And he can
not re-arm without military forces invading the Rhineland.
France, Belgium and Poland will not permit Hitler to take
up the armament bull in his own arms. They will act and
if tliev do, we are back to 11)18—only worse.
The prospect of war is almost too horrifying even to
contemplate. To imagine the improvements of science let
loose on civiliezd men, is incredible. But it has advanced
beyond the realm of the novelist's speculation. II is un
believable, but it is true that statesmen are forlornly ask
ing, "What next ?"

France, Belgium and Poland will not permit Hitler to take
up the armament bull in his own arms. They will act and
if tliev do, we are back to 11)18—only worse.
The prospect of war is almost too horrifying even to
contemplate. To imagine the improvements of science let
loose on civiliezd men, is incredible. But it has advanced
beyond the realm of the novelist's speculation. II is un
believable, but it is true that statesmen are forlornly ask
ing, "What next ?"
J.nsl week, llio Daily prophesied Mini the Disarmament
Conference would smash. The Saturday smash was more
violent and more sudden than was contemplated, il must,
in frankness, he admitted. But the result is the same: il
has been proved that the European situation is so tensely
ragged that diplomats can no longer settle an important
question around the conference tahle.
That is an ugly statement, hut a true one. The former
allies may he able to gather together and force terms on
Germany, hut Hitler lias definitely refused to go along the
usual diplomatic channels.
The hulk of international publications, and the thick
maze of international bodies, treaties, and organizations
have blinded some; just as some were blinded in 191 1. The
blindness, however, is more widespread today because the
horror of the War still lingers as a gory memory. Our
legless, our gassed, our shell-shocked arc still with us in
suflicient quantities to remind us of that hell.
But what next? What have we to prevent a repetition
of 11)1 1? The League of Nations has now been definitely
relegated to the status of an interesting but almost useless
curiosity. The Japanese were peeved, so they left. The
Germans are peeved, so they have left. Il is only a matter
of time, it seems, till the League of Nations will be a pure
bit of historical refuse.
The Hitler week-end antics are the biggest fireworks
so far in a nation's policy that is being built on showman
ship. What can he think? Does he suppose that he will
be allowed to re-arm after marching thousands of well
drilled troops around and around before the quivering
French proboscis? Does he expect to re-arm with his hard
blowing ministers prating about a re-union of all German
peoples? Nationally, the leaving of the Conference was a
splendid move. It will show a crushed people that they
have a lighting messiah.
But internationally, what? Hitler cannot come back to
the Conference without losing face at home. And he can
not re-arm without military forces invading the Rhineland.
France, Belgium and Poland will not permit Hitler to take
up the armament bull in his own arms. They will act and
if tliev do, we are back to 11)18—only worse.
