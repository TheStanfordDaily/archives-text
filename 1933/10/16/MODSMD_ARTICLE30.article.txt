# The 						Rough â€” He's an Old Smoothy
## 
### 
Long on whiskers and sliorl on money, the Stanford
liough, another of our unfortunately fast-fading traditions,
used to occupy an important spot in life on the Farm.
From all reports, there are as many of us today as ever
who are still weak on the use of razors and who wear pad
locks 011 our pocketbooks, hut where are the gents who
preferred cords to tweeds, sweaters to white shirts, and an
evening's hull session to datin" with Katie?
And what's going to happen to the remaining few now
that more women infest this famous institution for poor
men? Apparently, cords and an open shirt aren't good
enough (providing the face, neck and ears are clean) even
for a jolly-up. Sport outfits, suits and the latest natty
sweaters must he worn, the majority thinks, before a Stan
ford male dares intrude on a Roble 7 to <S or an hour's
dance in the women's gym.
With due respect to clothiers who depend on the cam
pus for their livelihoods, we look at the probable evolu
tion of men's living here. In the not too distant future, it
the present rate continues, the man who originally would
have been a rough will awaken, remove his fancy silk
pajamas, wrap himself in the latest Paris-designed robe,
jauntily toss his towel over his shoulder, stroll down to
the shower, cleanse himself with lavender-scented soap,
jump into a neatly pressed pair of flannels, a flashy coat
and a slick haircomh, have a delicious breakfast of dain
ties and stait his day by attending his first class at 11
o'clock, if lie is able.
And hack on the campus will come an alumnus from
'2X, only to have his hoped-for day of fun ruined by the
thought that lie crroncouslv went to the wrong campus.
