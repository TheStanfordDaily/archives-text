THE BEST PLAYS OF 1932-33
Edited by Burns Mantle
(At the Strawbridge Library in the
Cellar)
The indefatigable Mr. Mantle has
just tossed off his fifteenth compen
dium of the American stage, with
much the same manner and effect
that has accompanied his previous
tasks.
Hk preface is written in a hope
ful vein, prophesying new heights
for the theatre. As usual, the vol
ume contains resumes of the thea
tre in the four centers of the
country, as well as a good deal of
valuable statistical matter in the
appendices.
The list is headed by the Pulitzer
Piize Play "Both Your Houses,"
which is about as appealing to me
in its abridged form as it was in its
entirety—not at all.
Sidney Howard this year achieves
the distinction of being the first au
thor 1o be represented by two plays
in a single volume —this year's beirjg
Ihe widely differing "Aden Corn"
and "The Late Christopher Bean,"
currently in San Francisco with
Charlotte Greenwood in the Pauline
Lord role.
Two plays which were viewed
by the Coast last season arc in
ciuded: "Dinner at Eight," of
which Mr. Mantle makes a mod
erately successful abbreviation,
and "When Ladies Meet," prob
ably his most skillful cutting.
Such plays as "Design for Living'
and "Biography" present difficulties
to the editor, by reason of their
more volatile nature and the prob
lem of cutting of lines.
"Pigeons and People" is George M.

Cohan's debut under the Mantle
auspices, and it serves excellently
to represent one of the most inter
esting figures of the American thea
tre. The list is completed with the
delightfully human "One Sunday
Afternoon" and Elmer Rice's pon
derous "We, the People." —Chapin
THE SUMMER SEASON: lII—
Sati Francisco
Two new productions and one
return engagement composed the
entire activity of the San Fran
cisco legitimate theatre during the
summer months — the thinnest
summer season in years.
Jerome Kern's "Music in the Air,"
played two weeks to good business
but after an extension of one addi
tional week, further engagement was
apparently deemed unwise. The
Hecht-MacArthur satire, "Twentieth
Century," followed. Advertised as
"a twenty-two ton comedy hit," it
seems to have been somewhat pon
derous, for it left the boards soon
after.
The excellent "Counsellor-at-
Law," minus Otto Kruger, played
the longest engagement of the
summer —three weeks and three
days—which is surprising in light
of the fact that it had already
played eight earlier in the spring.
Noel Madison replaced Kruger
whom M-G-M was employing, and
the play is now touring the North
west with a view to a Canadian tour
as well. The play is the Coast's most
successful enterprise of the theatri
cal season, barring perhaps "The Cat
and the Fiddle," profits from which
must have been diminished by the
large company and heavy musical
investment. —Sandoe
