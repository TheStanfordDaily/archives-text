HEARSTOPHOBIA

To my little four-year-old sister
Ruth (if I had such a sister), the
words ' BOGEY, BOGEY, growled
! out in a sinister tone, will send her
running to mamma for protection.
To Acidophalus Hitler, the words
' "RABBI, RABBI" are enough to set
his heart fluttering dangerously, his
! larynx squirming violently, and his
! mustache wiggling foolishly. And to
a great section of ihe American pub
lic, "HEARSTY, HEARSTY" causes
righteous indignation to mount
; alarmingly, moral migraines to set
in, and muscular tongues to waggle
j vigorously.
! The name of William Randolph
Hearst, who has gained for himself
a multitude of more or less unflat
i tering sobriquets, is anathema on
the Stanford campus. Every pro
fessor knows that the surest way to
work up student enthusiasm for an
otherwise dull lecture, is to insert
a few deprecatory phrases regarding
this journalistic ogre. If the profes
j sor were to praise Mr. Hearst, the
boos would be directed at the lec
turer himself.
I
Pacifists hate Hearst for his jingo
ism, and 1898 hangover that he has
not yet worn off; professors sneer at
him for his ostrich-like nationalism;
liberals are nauseated at the canary
yellowness of his papers; conserva
tives are alienated by hi.s facility for
taking sex out of the nation's bed
i room and smearing it over glaring
front .pages; drys dislike him for his
dripping wetness; wets suspect that
he owns stock in distilleries; purists
denounce him for his Davies; but
Campus audiences boo by instinct.
Like all things else, Hearst must
be judged by comparison. To ex
pect William Randolph to be the
ANGEL OF THE PRESS, in a com-
I petitive field of printer's devils and
columnar imps, is to ask the impos-
I sible, the unreasonable.
Compared to the Los Angeles Rec
' old, Hearst is a hide-bound conser
: vative; compared to some of the
tabloids, the Hearst system is lined
with Mother of Pearl. And while
the San Francisco Examiner is half
: cocked in one direction, its unwill
' ing bedfellow, the Chronicle, is un
doubtedly askew in the other.
The Hearst chain, which as a
! whole is a dead weight around the
nation's throat, does play fair with
labor, has advocated a few worth
while reforms, suggested the expen
diture of millions for public works

at a time when public works were
both unpopular and needed, con
sistently fought for repeal, is de
lightfully and liberally refreshing in
the face of musty reactionaryism on
all sides.
So let THE WINDS OF FREE
DOM BLOW, not only in the direc
tion of Willy Hearst. A little well
directed wind wafted toward cer
tain other journals might well help
to scatter the intellectual fogs.

be judged by comparison. To ex
pect William Randolph to be the
ANGEL OF THE PRESS, in a com-
I petitive field of printer's devils and
columnar imps, is to ask the impos-
I sible, the unreasonable.
Compared to the Los Angeles Rec
' old, Hearst is a hide-bound conser
: vative; compared to some of the
tabloids, the Hearst system is lined
with Mother of Pearl. And while
the San Francisco Examiner is half
: cocked in one direction, its unwill
' ing bedfellow, the Chronicle, is un
doubtedly askew in the other.
The Hearst chain, which as a
! whole is a dead weight around the
nation's throat, does play fair with
labor, has advocated a few worth
while reforms, suggested the expen
diture of millions for public works

at a time when public works were
both unpopular and needed, con
sistently fought for repeal, is de
lightfully and liberally refreshing in
the face of musty reactionaryism on
all sides.
So let THE WINDS OF FREE
DOM BLOW, not only in the direc
tion of Willy Hearst. A little well
directed wind wafted toward cer
tain other journals might well help
to scatter the intellectual fogs.

HEARSTOPHOBIA

To my little four-year-old sister
Ruth (if I had such a sister), the
words ' BOGEY, BOGEY, growled
! out in a sinister tone, will send her
running to mamma for protection.
To Acidophalus Hitler, the words
' "RABBI, RABBI" are enough to set
his heart fluttering dangerously, his
! larynx squirming violently, and his
! mustache wiggling foolishly. And to
a great section of ihe American pub
lic, "HEARSTY, HEARSTY" causes
righteous indignation to mount
; alarmingly, moral migraines to set
in, and muscular tongues to waggle
j vigorously.
! The name of William Randolph
Hearst, who has gained for himself
a multitude of more or less unflat
i tering sobriquets, is anathema on
the Stanford campus. Every pro
fessor knows that the surest way to
work up student enthusiasm for an
otherwise dull lecture, is to insert
a few deprecatory phrases regarding
this journalistic ogre. If the profes
j sor were to praise Mr. Hearst, the
boos would be directed at the lec
turer himself.
I
Pacifists hate Hearst for his jingo
ism, and 1898 hangover that he has
not yet worn off; professors sneer at
him for his ostrich-like nationalism;
liberals are nauseated at the canary
yellowness of his papers; conserva
tives are alienated by hi.s facility for
taking sex out of the nation's bed
i room and smearing it over glaring
front .pages; drys dislike him for his
dripping wetness; wets suspect that
he owns stock in distilleries; purists
denounce him for his Davies; but
Campus audiences boo by instinct.
Like all things else, Hearst must
be judged by comparison. To ex
pect William Randolph to be the
ANGEL OF THE PRESS, in a com-
I petitive field of printer's devils and

I sible, the unreasonable.
