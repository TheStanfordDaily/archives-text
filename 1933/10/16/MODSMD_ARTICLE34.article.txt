## 
### 
Mae West, voluptous wise-cracker,
came to Stanford, registered in
Physics 161, and disappeared, leav
ing only a blue card to remember
her by. Displayed on the bulletin
board of the department where it
was put by a dismayed physics pro
fessor, the card reveals: Name, Mae
"Lil" West; address, Encina; major,
dramatics. Significant fact: Mae reg
istered for Stanford's most reveal
ing couse, X-rays.
Also signed up for the class by
the same fun-loving and unknown
student was Sally Rand, noted for
her fans and dancing.
