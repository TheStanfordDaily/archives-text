# Sequoia to Be Turned Into Barn for Hollowe'en Dance
## 
### 
The old rambling structure, known
about the campus as Sequoia Hall,
is to be turned into a barn. That
was the decision reached by the
roughs as the motif of their Hal
lowe'en dance to be held next Fri
day.
Apple Ducking and all the old
time Hallowe'en stunts will feature
ihe party. The dance will be open
to all.
