# PUBLIC DISCUSSION TO BE ATTEMPTED THURSDAY EVENING
## California Labor Problems Chosen as Subject 
### 
Eull sessioning has traditionally
j been the informal discussion of
politics, sex and God in dormitory
I rooms.
Dignified and formal will bull
j sessioning become when a first
; and trial Public Forum is staged
I in tiits Little Theatre next Thurs
day evening at 7:15 o'clock.
Patterned after the famed Oxford
Union, Public Forum hopes to es
tablish itself as a virile and weekly
! meeting at which students will dis
cuss political, economic, and social
questions of the day. Plans remain
I in the embryo as yet, but promoters
! admit campus questions may in time
! be discussed.
Thursday night's discussion will
I concern Central California labor
j troubles. Bromley Smith and Comp
j ton Bangs, week-end visitors to the
: strike scene where labor shoots at
! law, will introduce the subject, one
! presenting the growers' view, one
labor's view. Then the subject will
j be turned over to the floor.
Momentum to overcome inertia
j of student indifference has been
gained by circulation of a formal
proclamation, signed by campus
leaders.
I Excerpts: "They (the organizers)
are moved to do this by the consid-
I oration ihat. at present there is no
i means by which student opinion
may become vocal; by expectation
of profit from the practice and habit
of free speech.
"It is proposed to establish the
! rough outline of a society to which
all Stanford men and women—un
-1 dergraduate and graduate—can be
-1 long. Such a society can conduct
! its debates according 1o regular par
i liamentary procedure."
