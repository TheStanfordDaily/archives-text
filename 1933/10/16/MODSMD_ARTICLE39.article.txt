# EDITIONS OF LEWIS CARROLL EXHIBITED IN LIBRARY CASES
## Various Foreign Pictures Of Alice Displayed 
### 
Was Alice in Wonderland blonde
or brunette? The coloring of this
naive English girl, glorified some 70
years ago by Lewis (not Earl) Car
roll is a matter of international dis
agreement. An illustx'ation of this is
seen in a display of representative
English editions of the popular book
end foreign translations of it, now
being shown in the glass cases on
the second floor of the Library.
Famed in story, song, and drama,
and about to make good in Holly
wood's cinematic limelight, what
little Alice looked like has always
been an important issue.
As photographs in the exhibit
show, Alice Liddell, the girl from
whom Carroll drew his character,
was a brunette with short hair. In
illustrating his first manuscript,
which was handwritten and in
tended as a Christmas gift to Alice,
the author pictured his heroine
with long, dark tresses. Since then,
there has been little agreement
among illustrators although the ma
jority of ti:e early ones confined
themselves to the pinafored child
with blonde hair hanging down her
back who is the traditional Alice to
Americans.
Not so with other nations. In the
Polish translation Alice has short
skirts and bobbed hair. The Ger
mans typified their own race by
depicting her with long be-ribboned
blonde braids. Americans, looking
at the Jewish translation, would not
recognize their favorite heroine in
the babyish five-year-old child
dressed in flowing robes.
In Russia, Alice and her friends,
the White Rabbit and the caterpil
lar, are drawn modernistically with
a night-mare effect. The Norwe
gian book shows the conventional
English Alice, while the Chinese
omitted illustrations altogether.
