# Mississippi Mud
## 
### 
What we lose on the orange, we
make on the banan'. So that an
nually flooded Nebraska, lowa, and
Missouri will no longer be flooded,
so that northeast Montana ana'
northern Dakota wlil not be
drouthed, the muddy Missouri may
soon be curbed by a huge Fort Peck
dam in Montana. In return, 300
lanches and two small settlements
will be sacrifically submerged.
