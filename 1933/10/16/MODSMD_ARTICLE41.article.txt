# SIDELINE SLANTS..
## WILDCATS, CARDS. NO ARGUMENT FOR WARNER 
### 
Deflation, an annual event for the
Stanford Varsity, hit that crew of
worthies Saturday. It's nice to think
that we won't have to wait this time
clear until the S.C. game in order to
get a dispassionate view of the Car
dinals.
It was disappointing to the critics
who had all gathered from afar ir
Soldier's Field to view the two best,
known exponents of the Warner of
fense. It was not much of an argu
ment for the "Old Man's ideas on
offense.
Both teams used the line shift
from the 1-9-1 set-up, but the!
Northwesterners employed some
complicated variations, not unlike
the S.C. "panther crawl" getting into
Hit 1-9-1 from the huddle. Accord
ing 1o Ted Husing, Hanley's plays
and .shifts were far more intricate ,
than Thornhill's. The Wildcats used
double and single wing, and a tricky
.short punt formation, with shifting
variations of these three standard
sets.
