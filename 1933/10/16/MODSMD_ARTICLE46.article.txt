# Frosh Gridders Nosed Out by Trojans, 6-3
## WILLIAMS' FIELD GOAL SCORES FOR LONE CARD TALLY S.C. Babes Come Back With Long Scoring Pass 
### 
Clinging to a narrow but seem
ingly sufficient .'3-0 lead until the
closing minutes of play, Stanford's
I strong freshman grid team was
nosed out in Saturday's game with
the supposedly strongest S.C. frosh
' outfit in years by a long, last-period
pass lhat netted the Trobabes a 6-3
victory.
Playing on even terms through
out the first half, neither team
could penetrate (he other's de
fense to a scoring position. En
tering the second half, Stanford
kicked off to the Trobabes who
fumbled the! ball, the Indians re
covering.
Cashing in on this break, Stan
ford called on Fred Williams, ace
converter of the squad, who place
kicked successfully from the 19-
yard line for three points and a
near victory.
Trobabes Score
After nursing this slender margin
until the last three minutes of play,
the Indian frosh were the victims
of an eleventh pass that, starting
well within S.C.'s territory, trav
eled 30 yards from Davis to Powers,
who proceeded to gallop unmolested
for 40 yards more to a touchdown.
Kidder failed to convert.
Earlier in the fourth period Wil
liams had tried another place-kick
for Stanford but the ball sailed
wide of the cross-bars. It was
Williams' expert toe that con
verted the freshmen's first touch
down of the year into a 7-(Â» vic
tory over San Mateo Junior Col
lege.
As in previous S. C. - Stanford
freshman games, both teams were
guilty of some rather ragged foot
ball, with a number of fumbles to
mar proceedings on both sides.
Stanford alone profited by oppo
nents' errors, however, the place
kick corning indirectly via a recov
ered fumble. Davis, winning passer
for the Trobabes though a substi
tute, was outstanding for S.C. Wil
liams, besides scoring Stanford's
three points, was also chief ground
gainer for the Indians.
Victory Is Luck
By holding the vaunted scoring
attack of the Trobabes, led by the
great Theron Keller, in check
throughout the greater part of the
games, the Stanford frosh demon
strated that they Have a really great
defensive combination, headed by a
powerful, heavy line. Rated as hav
ing one of the best squads they have
ever turned out, the S.C. frosh ran
into real opposition Saturday. Bot
tling up the star Trobabe backs, the
Indians were defeated only through
a lucky last-minute "prayer" pass.
