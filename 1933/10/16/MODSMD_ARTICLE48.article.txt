Although Stanford's Indians traveled all the way to Chicago to help determine whether the Cardinals or
Northwestern's Wildcats played better football, the game resulted in a scoreless tie. Ollie Olson was perhaps
most instrumental in preventing a Stanford score; Bill Corbus again played like his all-American self: Bill Sim
was in there for 60 minutes; and the record of but seven substitutions throughout the game kept injured Bones
Hamilton and Jack Sullivan on their respective benches.
