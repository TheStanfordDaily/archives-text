# KAHN ASKS ORDER IN MURAL GAMES
## Players Must Give Way To Referee Captains 
### 
A plea for team captains to co
operate in settling differences aris
ing. by keeping the players out of
the discussion between captain and
referee, was made by Marvie Kahn
at the Tuesday intramural repre
sentative meeting.
Flay is to be conducted according
to 1933 football rules, with the ex
ception of a few minor changes as
will be explained below, and as ap
pear in the Red Book.
No penalty will be imposed< for
two or more incompleted forward
passes in the same series of downs.
Two hands of an opponent on any
part of the ball-carrier's body will
make the ball dead. No clipping
(blocking from the rear) will be al
lowed, nor will leaving the feet on
a front block be countenanced.
Shoulder blocking is okeh. An eligi
ble man can participate with only
one touch-football team during the
season. No time-outs can be called
during the last five minutes of play,
as time-outs in touch-football are
counted as playing time. This pro
vision is to do away with stalling at
the last minute.
In case of a tie it was explained at
the meeting that each team alter
nates in taking the ball for ten
plays, but during those plays no
punting is allowed.
The question of instituting vol
ley ball in the intramural schedule
was dropped as there are no funds
available for providing the neces
sary equipment.
