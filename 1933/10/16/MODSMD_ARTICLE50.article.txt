# Chef Stealing Drofnats Stuff as Crystal-Gazer
## 
### 
Johnny Drofnats, able Daily prog
nosticator of football scores, has a
worthy rival. He is Charlie Walsh,
grid expert par excellence and chef
in Roble Hall.
Walsh, who second-guesses games
before they are played, missed the
San Jose State contest score by a
touchdov/n. He picked Stanford
over Santa Clara 13 to 6 and hit the
U.C.L.A. score exactly when he
"knew" in advance that Stanford
would win 3 to 0.
Last Saturday, Charlie did what
many could not: for hours he de
liberated between 3 to 0 (Stanford)
and a scoreless tie. Finally deciding
upon the former, Charlie said after
the game, airily, "Well, they should
have scored anyway."
