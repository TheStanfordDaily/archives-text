# HARD TILTS FACE COAST'S GRIDMEN
## Cougar-Bear Game Heads Next Week's Play 
### 
The Pacific Coast Confer-ence will
be engaged in playing off a number
of breather games this week, relax
ing from last Saturday's three criti
cal meetings and preparing for an
outburst of activity on October 28.
The week's most important game
will be at Pullman, where the
Washington State Cougars will
meet the California Golden Bears
in a game that has furnished
plenty of thrills in all past en
counters. The Staters dropped an
early season game to U.S.C. 33-0,
and had some difficulty in sub
duing the weak Montana aggre
gation this last week-end.
California was defeated in the
season's first game by Santa Clara
7 to 0. but came back last week to
take the much-touted "Gaels" 14-13.
This week-end they defeated the
strong Olympic Club team 23-0.
The Trojans of U.S.C. tangle with
Oregon State and have excellent
chances of making their twenty
seventh consecutive victory.
Stanford, well chastened by
their 0-0 tie with Northwestern,
take on Spud Lewis's little San
Francisco Dons. The Cardinals
should not have 100 tough a time
though S.F.U. held St. Mary's to a
lone touchodwn in an early
counter.
Oregon, after upsetting Phelan's
IJuskies, has a breather in Idaho
on Saturday. The game last week
which resulted in a 7-0 decision for
the Webfeet was mostly Mike Milu
lak who eluded the Husky defense
and stopped their offense. Wash
ington meets the College of Puget
Sound in a breather before the
Stanford game.
St. Mary's, having lost to Califor
nia and S.C., will be idle. After a
week's rest, Santa Clara this week
meets the Olympic Club in San
Francisco.
