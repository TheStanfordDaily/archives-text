# CARDINAL SOCCER SQUAD DEFEATED IN FIRST CONTEST
## S.F.U. Offense Makes Two Scores in First Half 
### 
Stanford's soccer varsity took
the count from San Francisco
University's first string soccernien
with a 2-0 loss Saturday, the con
test initiating the 1933 conference
series.
; Like a well-oiled battering ram
the Dons' forward line got into the
Indian goal areas and pounded in a
score in each of the first two quar
ters. The principal difficulty with
their offense was the defense of the
j Warrior halfbacks, Johnny Moore,
Johnny Hitchcock, and Rudy Gon*-
zales. Further difficulty with their
aggressive play was the resistance
put up by Dick Strouse, Stanford
1 lght fullback, by the master goalie
Jeck King, and by Strouse's alter
nating assistants, Hod Lewis (first
land second quarters), Waddy White
(second, third, and fourth quarters),
land Bob Smithers (last quarter).
Stanford Holds Own
Action in the last half was plen
tiful and playing credit went largely
to the Stanford squad which cer
tainly held its own and produced a
1 pleasing number of scoring threats.
With the exception of the excellent
playing of Captain Carl Knecht,
Stanford's forward line was not up
to par and did some muffing. Occa
sional reversions to their best play
ing form gave plenty of work to the
j Dons' goalie, who performed a cou
ple of nice saves.
Stanford's play in the first half
was excelled by that of the S.F.U.
| men who scored their first point on
I a clever head-to-foot pass which
j took Strouse out of the play and
j cleared the way for a swift boot
I which was too hot for goal-guard
King. A very doubtful and disputed
, score made the count 2-0 in the sec
ond quarter when the pelota re
: bounded from the cross-bar at an
angle which, according to Bill El
; lington, who was watching on the
goal-line, shot it back into the field
lof play. The referee ruled that the
ball had rebounded into the goal
mouth in spite of having seen it
from the center of the field.
New Cardinal Line-Up
Shortly before the end of the fra
| eas Coach Maloney tried a new
line-up on the field shifting White
:up to center half, putting Johnny
Moore up in the center forward post,
and retiring Cy Johnson tempor-
I arily while Smithers replaced White
at the fullback berth. Moore, ver
satile and experienced player, cov
ered the center forward job as well
as he had cared for the center half
position.
Stanford's line-up was: forwards,
Knecht, Gomes, Johnson, Dodding
ton, and Hearn; halfbacks, Hitch
cock, Moore, and Gonzales; full
backs, Strouse and Lewis; goalie.
King.
S.F.U.'s arrangement was: for
wards, Rhode, Korn, Applegate,
Gordon, and Hughes; halfs, Donog
hue, McMilty, and Wicklow; full
backs; Isola and Buzzani; goalie,
Cronin.
