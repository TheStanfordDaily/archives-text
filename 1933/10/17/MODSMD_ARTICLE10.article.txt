SEATTLE, Wash., Oct. 16 (P.I.P)
â€”A series of informal lectures on
personality, dynamic teaching meth
ods. and clear, forceful expression
of knowledge is being attended by
a number of the University of
Washington professors in an attempt
to crash through the personal bar
riers which separate the University
students and instructors.
At present all the proceedings are
informal, but next year the course
may be entered into the University
curriculum to be taken for credit.
