The nigger in the Palo Alto Shel-'
I ter's woodpile is more than likely
I to be a Stanford man. The smiling
J Shelter clerk reports that eight out ,
I of the 14 men who worked off speed-
I ing fines during the past two weeks
J hailed from the campus. !;
I Asked if the collegiate talent ap- i
I pea red new to the wood-chopping
[I game, he said, "We just give them j
■ <i saw or an axe and tell them to i
I i'o right ahead. They're rather

Husky—those fellows. We never
have to show them how to do it."
Two and one-half hours of work
is the average amount done by stu
dents, it was revealed.
This novel way of escaping fines
at the hands of Palo Alto's ever
alert traffic police, has been a popu
lar Stanford custom for the past
year. Wood for the choppers is sup
plied by the obliging Shelter, a
charity project that provides food
