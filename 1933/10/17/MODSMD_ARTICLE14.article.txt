# Public Forums To Start Soon
## First Meet Designed For Electing Officers 
### 
Thursday's session of the proposed
Public Forum will meet at a place
to be announced later for the pur
pose r/ electing a president and
ether machinery. This was decided
at e pre-meeting of prime-mover
vor Breton, Maxine Yaple, and
Gibers at real prime-mover Profes
sor Clokie's house last night.
Jerry Trautmsn will gavel this
first meeting to order, and all in
terested are invited to attend. Not
( nly will the hierarchy be named
Thursday night, but a discussion of
a possible subject for the first pub
lic forum next week will be in
order.
Aspiring to the aims of the well
known Oxford Union, this newest
of Stanford interests will let off
campus steam and, it is hoped, de
velop into as spirited a series of
gatherings as were last year's argu
ments on the then-current political
question. Needless to say, topics are
far from lacking today.
Strike-investigators Smith and
Bangs, who have been poking their
probing noses into the central Cali
fornia labor strikes in the last few
days, may be on hand the follow
ing week if that question is decided
upon Thursday night. Discussion
from the floor will, of course, be the
main feature of every meeting.
