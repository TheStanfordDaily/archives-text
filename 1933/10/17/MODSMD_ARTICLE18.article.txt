# Palo Alto Medic Surprises Mother With Novel News
## 
### 
Discussing physicians' inability to
correctly diagnose mental diseases,
Dr. Calvin Percy Stone last Friday
in his abnormal psychology told
this story on a Palo Alto medic.
Caring for a fond mother's baby,
the doctor continually assured the
mother of the child's health. For
six months, the physician insisted
that the baby was normal.
At last the doctor, not at all
chagrined, noticed peculiarities in
the baby's behavior. The mother
did likewise. Breaking the news
gently, the physician nonchalantly
notified the mother one bright day
that, "There is nothing wrong with
your child at allâ€”except that he'll
grow up to be an idiot."
