-3<l rushing season.
Decided last night's session of

With simplicity and economy the
slogans of the rushing season-to-be,
Pan-Hellenic's president, Mary Rath,
quashed Row protests against the
decree lhat hostesses as well as
guests must wear Quad clothes at
the teas, and that the menu named
must be followed in all houses.
Establishing a possible precedent,
invitations to the fall teas, which
have heretofore extended to all new
women, will be limited. Such action
has been necessitated by the excep
tional number of entering women.
It is probable that these invitations
will be distributed throughout the
halls and later collected to be re
turned tf> the sororities.
Rushing rules, to include regula
tions by which the winter quarter
siege will be conducted, are at pres
ent being revised by Pan-Hellenic;
findings and solutions to new prob
lems to be released soon. Winter
quarter rush period dates are ten
tatively set for the second week in
