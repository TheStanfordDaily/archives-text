# Campus Scientists Prepare Weight-Control Compound
## 
### 
Up in a smutty attic-laboratory of
the Stanford physiology building, a
fascinating experiment is under way.
Dr. Victor E. Hall, short and stocky
Assistant Professor of biology and
physiology at Stanford, and Dr.
Maurice L. Tainter, nationally re
! nowned pharmacologist, also of
Stanford, are attempting to find a
way to aid modern woman in her
fight against adipose tissue.
They are trying to perfect the
, chemical compound, di-nitro-phe
nal, which was discussed by Tainter
tiiis summer at the meeting of the
American Association of Pharmacol
i ogy, held at Salt Lake City.
If this experiment is perfected, it
means that weight may be controlled
by burning up excess fuel and en
ergy of the body.
