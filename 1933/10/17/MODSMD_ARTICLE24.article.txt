# Back from Chicago, Tired Gridders Face U.S.F. on Saturday
## Stanford Gridmen Will Have Three Days of Practice Before Tackling Defensively Strong Don Outfit; Spud Lewis Boasts Powerful Line 
### BY OLIVER JOHNSTON, JR 
A badly pummclcd Indian squad composed of 34 players returns to I
the campus tomorrow morning with only three days in which to prepare |
for the strong San Francisco Dons.
Against Northwestern (he Indians ran into a very strong line, and i
heir offense ceased to function. This year llead Coach Spud Lewis of the i
■ hnucic ftrw* nf < cl mnrJn_

'uon.s Doasis one 01 tne strongest cte
! fensive lines he has had at San
Francisco. On top of that he also
uses the Warner system and conse
quently his men know the Stanford
i plays just about as well as the In
dians do themselves.
This does not necessarily mean
that next Saturday is going to be a
repetition of the Wildcat game. To
date the Dons have not emerged
victor in a single contest, although
they have out-statisticed most of
their opponents. In the St. Mary's
game it was an even battle all the
1 way and the Gaels were lucky to
score a touchdown on a fluke and
ipull out ahead.

Spud Lewis has had more than
his share of bad breaks. The last
blow to his hopes was the loss of his
star end, Vic Wilson, through scho
lastic difficulties. In spite of this
loss, the line is still U.S.F.'s strong
est asset. Seimering, the Don cen
ter, is rated by Lewis as the strong
est center on the Coast. If this be
true Bill Bates may find more than
he can do to keep this fellow out
of the Indian backfield.
S.F.U. Handicapped
In the backfield Spud Lewis has
hi; worries. In Condray he has an
average plunger, and in Bianchi a
fairly good passer. There is no out
standing kicker.
Another blow to U.S.F.'s chances
in this all-important game is the
probably loss through ineligibility
of Jim "Curly" Hall, the flashy Au
rora, Illinois, quarterback who in
his three games played on the Pa
cific Coast showed himself to be a
cool-headed, smooth-playing back
field star.
Blocking Needed
Good blocking will be a neces
sity if the Indians' offense is to score
touchdowns next Saturday. The
halfbacks and ends must block well
to break the ball carrier into the
open. Except for a few flashes their
performances have been ragged.
II Bones Hamilton is in condition
to play, he may furnish the needed
punch to put Stanford's offense in
scoring form. His superior hard
blocking and good running may
p;.ve the way for several touch
downs in Kezar Stadium Saturday.
He may also bolster the Indian pass
defense, which has been woefully
weak to date.

field star.
Blocking Needed
Good blocking will be a neces
sity if the Indians' offense is to score
touchdowns next Saturday. The
halfbacks and ends must block well
to break the ball carrier into the
open. Except for a few flashes their
performances have been ragged.
II Bones Hamilton is in condition
to play, he may furnish the needed
punch to put Stanford's offense in
scoring form. His superior hard
blocking and good running may
p;.ve the way for several touch
downs in Kezar Stadium Saturday.
He may also bolster the Indian pass
defense, which has been woefully
weak to date.

Francisco. On top of that he also
uses the Warner system and conse

This does not necessarily mean
that next Saturday is going to be a
repetition of the Wildcat game. To
date the Dons have not emerged
victor in a single contest, although
they have out-statisticed most of
their opponents. In the St. Mary's
game it was an even battle all the
1 way and the Gaels were lucky to
score a touchdown on a fluke and
ipull out ahead.

Spud Lewis has had more than
his share of bad breaks. The last
blow to his hopes was the loss of his
star end, Vic Wilson, through scho
lastic difficulties. In spite of this
loss, the line is still U.S.F.'s strong
est asset. Seimering, the Don cen
ter, is rated by Lewis as the strong
est center on the Coast. If this be
true Bill Bates may find more than
he can do to keep this fellow out
of the Indian backfield.
S.F.U. Handicapped
In the backfield Spud Lewis has
hi; worries. In Condray he has an
average plunger, and in Bianchi a
fairly good passer. There is no out
standing kicker.
Another blow to U.S.F.'s chances
in this all-important game is the
probably loss through ineligibility
of Jim "Curly" Hall, the flashy Au

his three games played on the Pa

cool-headed, smooth-playing back
field star.
