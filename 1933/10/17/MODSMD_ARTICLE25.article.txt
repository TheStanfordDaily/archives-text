# Dippy Grid Fund Mounts--Chances For Win Better
## 
### Tinkle Molehill 
Coach of the Daily's Big Black
and Blue Machine Exclusive
to the "Daily"
Like the Stanford varsity,
Stanford Daily's gridiron hopes
are yet unscored upon, almost
unscoring. Dippy Board of
Strategy is undismayed. Said
the strategists: "With a little co
operation from alumni, about
$10,000 worth, we will yet win
the Big Game."
Almost simultaneously with
this announcement, a tortured
cry went out to gray-bearded
grads of the copy desk to con
tribute generously to the Daily
War Chest. The cry: "Give 'till
it itches!"
Daily staffers, traditionally
itchy, are being clubbed, cajoled,
coralled into donating to the
gigantic fund. Purpose of the
fund: To buy off the cream of
athletes from the Fleischacker
and allied zoos.
Scouts have been dispatched
to distant parts of the earth with
the explicit instructions: "Bring
'em Back Alive!" These care
fully worded instructions were
issued only after much heated
argument by the B. of S. Half
of the delegation, with eyes on
the Chappie office, thought the
slogan, "Dead or Alive," would
suffice.
In the event that the Dippy's
big game hunters do not return
in time, Johnny Drofnats, sen
sational one-man-team, can be
relied upon to hold back the
Chaparral onslaught. The Daily
will triumph!
