# Frozen Banks to Thaw
## 
### 
Reconstruction Corporation Chair- j
man Jones assured depositors today
tho government is "ready to pro- ,
ceed with all possible dispatch" to
release $1,000,000,000 in frozen bank
assets. Jones set five years as the
"probable period for orderly liqui
d; tion" without sacrificing assets j
and cutting depositor pay-offs.
Meanwhile California Banking Su
perintendent Rainey felt that the
Washington move was "the creation
of a new agency for giving the sub
ject intensive attention rather than
a new policy as to loans to closed,
banks." He pointed out that there
has been no dumping of California
bank assets in liquidation. Closed
state banks watch situation, stand
ing ready to apply any new and
sound government policy.
