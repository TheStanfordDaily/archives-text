Dr. Ichihashi Will Discuss
Japanese Education
By Will Williams
"All the streets in Tokyo are now
paved. One does not suffer the
bumping which was a common fea
ture of the old-time taxi-rides," de
clared Dr. Yamato Ichihashi, who is
to talk this evening on the cultural
history of ancient and modern Ja
pan, at 7:.'JO o'clock in the Assembly
Hall.
Having just returned from his sec
ond sabbatical journey to Japan, Dr.
Ichihashi was enthusiastic about the
changes which have taken placc
since his visit seven years ago.
Tokyo Changed
"It hardly seems to be Japan any
more," Ichihashi said. "Even Tokyo
has grown to look like any modern
industrial city." The great change in
cultural trends which so impressed
him will form a part of Dr. ichiha
shi's talk tonight.
Dr. Ichihashi, while in Takyo
was extended the unusual honor
of being asked to give a lecture
course at the exclusive Imperial
University, Tokyo, Japan. He
taught American and Japanese
Diplomatic Relations in the Law
Division.
Asked about the difference be
tween Japanese and American uni
versities, Dr. Ichihashi leaned back
in his chair and puffed his pipe re
flectively.
"They differ greatly," he said. "In
the first place, ihe Imperial Univer
sity really corresponds to our schools
of graduate study. There arc seven
departments, each independent of
the others, including Law, Econom
ics, Letters, Agriculture, Technol
ogy, Science, and Medicine. Here
the students come to specialize aftfi'
doing three years of work at a pre
liminary school."
Imperial University
The Imperial University has a
fairly large enrollment, totaling
nearly 8,500 students. The competi
tion is intense, according to Dr. Ichi
hashi. "The students are selected
solely from those who make the
highest grades in the entrance ex
amination. For a Japanese to grad
uate from the Tokyo Imperial Uni
versity automatically establishes his
prestige. It is, for him, like being
able to say, 'I am a Stanford man.'
The Japanese respect for education
is very great."
Primarily a research institu
tion, the faculty is relatively large,
and the course of study occupies
from three <•» live years. As a
result, most students at the Impe
rial University are older than the
American students.

ture of the old-time taxi-rides," de
clared Dr. Yamato Ichihashi, who is
to talk this evening on the cultural
history of ancient and modern Ja
pan, at 7:.'JO o'clock in the Assembly
Hall.
Having just returned from his sec
ond sabbatical journey to Japan, Dr.
Ichihashi was enthusiastic about the
changes which have taken placc
since his visit seven years ago.
Tokyo Changed
"It hardly seems to be Japan any
more," Ichihashi said. "Even Tokyo
has grown to look like any modern
industrial city." The great change in
cultural trends which so impressed
him will form a part of Dr. ichiha
shi's talk tonight.
Dr. Ichihashi, while in Takyo
was extended the unusual honor
of being asked to give a lecture
course at the exclusive Imperial
University, Tokyo, Japan. He
taught American and Japanese
Diplomatic Relations in the Law
Division.
Asked about the difference be
tween Japanese and American uni
versities, Dr. Ichihashi leaned back
in his chair and puffed his pipe re
flectively.
"They differ greatly," he said. "In
the first place, ihe Imperial Univer
sity really corresponds to our schools
of graduate study. There arc seven
departments, each independent of
the others, including Law, Econom
ics, Letters, Agriculture, Technol
ogy, Science, and Medicine. Here
the students come to specialize aftfi'
doing three years of work at a pre
liminary school."
Imperial University
The Imperial University has a
fairly large enrollment, totaling
nearly 8,500 students. The competi
tion is intense, according to Dr. Ichi
hashi. "The students are selected
solely from those who make the
highest grades in the entrance ex
amination. For a Japanese to grad
uate from the Tokyo Imperial Uni
versity automatically establishes his
prestige. It is, for him, like being
able to say, 'I am a Stanford man.'
The Japanese respect for education
is very great."
Primarily a research institu
tion, the faculty is relatively large,
and the course of study occupies
from three <•» live years. As a
result, most students at the Impe
rial University are older than the
American students.
