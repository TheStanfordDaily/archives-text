"What campus feminine Big Shot
I rushed a Zete legacy Phi Psi at the
1 Union jolly-up?"â€”thus might Wal
| ter Winrhell have characterized the
efforts of a Certain Ambitious Young
Lady had lie been peeking through
the keyhole at Wednesday's dance.
Ecstatically enthusiastic, the Cer
tain Ambitious Young Lady ex
tolled Phi Kappa Psi's virtues far
into the night. The handsome frosh
man was interested, unmoved.
But love's labor was lost. Next
clay, the Young Lady was surprised,
chagrined. Not until then did she
! know of the relationship between a
I zealous, gridman - giving Stanford
I alumnus, the Handsome Young
i Man, and Zeta Psi.
