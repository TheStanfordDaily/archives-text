# To Win at All Costs
## 
### 
The Chaparral has Hung down the gauntlet. The Daily
picks il up with a feverish anxiety. We are out to win at
ill I eosts. The first thing is organization; so we organize.
First, ii Hoard of Strategy with general supervisory powers
;iikl mysterious offices located in the hills north of the
I Wan Lab. Second, a coach, and what a coach—none other
than that fearless fox, that cunning cougar — "Tinkle"
Molehill the first. There being only one like him.
This has run up our expenses; hut with a sell-out for
the "Big (lame" with the charging Chappies, we will more
than break even. We have already spent our profits, in
fact. Fifty per cent of them have gone toward Daily build
ing improvements a new key for the telephone booth and
a new lock to lit around the new key for the telephone
booth. The other half of the profits will go toward pur
chasing better material for the Daily squad next year. For
it must be impressed upon all of our alumni that the Daily
plans to win this year and every year as long as our
money holds out.
As amateur crowds go, the Chappie bunch are pretty
fair pig-skinners. But they will meet no amateur outfit in
the Daily aggregation. We have organized the nation into
twelve districts—much in the manner of the Federal Re
serve System. With headquarters in each district to cor
relate information and with scouts in the field, we plan to
gather the best team that money can buy. Form instruc
tions have gone out to all. No mine shaft is to be left un
touched, no logging camp uncovered, in our search for
material.
The Daily is determined to win at all costs and our
millionaire alumni are paying those costs. Our organiza
tion perfected, our team being recruited, and our poten
tial profits already spent, the Daily Board of Strategy is
looking forward with optimism to the encounter with those
poor bovs from the Chaparral.
