# Resurrection of Ram's Head

### 
Ail honor society is a very nebulous thing at best. And
very lew of Iheni ever reach their host at Stanford. They
meander along, then fade entirely in all hut name, initia
tion, pins, and dues especially dues. In that category was
Ham's Head mythical sponsor of the Big (lame Gaieties.
Then, they pronounce that they will take part in the
program that gives them so much free publicity. They will
conduct a contest* and award prizes for the funniest skits.
It is heartening and startling to see an honor society thus
lift itself from less than a living death. May they continue
further.
And Ham's Head is only one and not the worst. The
Quad is tilled with self-named honor societies which honor
nothing and, once conferring their particular unknown
honor, fade even from this slight activity. These organiza
tions do nothing but clutter the stream of campus life. If a
batch of them were permanently interred jiikl thus ended
their ghost-like existence, the campus would be a happier
place.
