# BULL SESSION
## THERE IS BEAUTY IN THE BELLOW OF THE BLAST 
### 
If you want to spend a quiet win
ter evening at home with a good
book and a pipe and an apple and a
i box of candy and a pair of old slip
' pers, it's no affair of mine. But if
you want to spend a decent night
| sleeping or a balmy winter after
noon napping, that's a horse of an
other feather, and you might as well
be warned now that the cards are
stacked against you, the dice are
loaded, and it is all a snare and a ,
| delusion. It can't be done.
If you have the good fortune to
get comfortably to sleep, you are
1 not to be envied, for in certain por
tions of this insidious campus there
are menaces lying in ambush for
i just such an opportunity, menaces
J compared to which King Kong is as
! a little child. I speak of radiators.
.
Unlike alarm clocks, first they
j shout and then they roar. You will
! perchance be quietly and gently i
i dropping off to innocent sleep, when
suddenly the building will begin to
jitter, the windows clatter, and your
brain (as you fondly call it) to rat
tle about in your head. "The radia
i tor," you may say grimly to your
self, putting forefinger A into ear B
1 and attempting to resume your
slumbers. Not a chance.
Before you can say "transcenden
-1 talism," the pandemonium resumes,
approximately doubled in force.
Maybe you are blessed with two
! radiators, in which event the two
! will carry on their fulminations in
the form of a dialog, which very
quickly develops into a first-rate
Anvil Chorus. In this rendition, if
you are aesthetically-minded, you
will find much beauty. First, there
appears a short prelude in the form
of an andante, then a rousing cres
! cendo, and ultimately a fortissimo
j that would put John Philip Sousa to
! shame. Then you will settle back
| and assure yourself that it is all
! over.
Suddenly ' there begins a repeat
performance. What can mere hu
man do against the combined forces
! of nature and the Corporation Yard?
Heat will begin to issue from the
radiators, perspiration from your I
| brow, and refined words from be
, tween your teeth. You may even i
' issue from your bed and—which |
j heaven forbid!—issue such guff as
this. —Elizabeth Chapin

jitter, the windows clatter, and your

self, putting forefinger A into ear B

slumbers. Not a chance.

Anvil Chorus. In this rendition, if

If you want to spend a quiet win
ter evening at home with a good
book and a pipe and an apple and a
i box of candy and a pair of old slip
' pers, it's no affair of mine. But if
you want to spend a decent night
| sleeping or a balmy winter after
noon napping, that's a horse of an
other feather, and you might as well
be warned now that the cards are
stacked against you, the dice are
loaded, and it is all a snare and a ,
| delusion. It can't be done.
