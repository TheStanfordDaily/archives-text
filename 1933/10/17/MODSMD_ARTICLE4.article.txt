# Determined Strikers
## 
### 
Cotton strike conditions get worse
and worse. Both strikers and own
ers are getting madder and madder.
The pickers intend to keep it lip on
that line if it takes all winter. Gov
ernor llolph's "fact finding commit
tee" has not met as scheduled. The
strikers' ranks are increasing rather
than diminishing. All sorts of sym
pathizers are joining their ranks and
giving aid. Strikers assert they will
"starve first before we will give in."
