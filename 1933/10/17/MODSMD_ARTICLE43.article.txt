THE LEFT BANK (Rice)
At the Fairmont Playhouse
Elmer Rice's play leaves one be
iuddled as to what it is all about.
One witnesses a series of debates on
the relative merits of France and
America, frank American tourists
and turncoat American Frenchmen,
monogamy and polygamy, spiritual
freedom and "practical life," mod
ern educational methods and "the
child's place in the home." Although
Rice expresses himself in favor of
America, monogamy, less spiritual
freedom, and old educational meth
ods, he gives too little time to any
one.- subject to make it seem really
giipping or even important.
All the debates are smoothly
linked together, along with a Bo
hemian party and a pleasant se
uction, in the easy and natural
Kice manner of realistic detail.
The man is a remarkable techni
cian.
If one wants an accurate and usu
sually interesting three-act picture
of life in thelstudent's Paris, one will
find it in The Left Bank. But one
will not find the dramatic force of
"Street Scene" or "Counsellor-at-
Law."
Davis and McGraw give it a spir
ited production, with Jean Scott,
natural and intensely sincere, easily
walking off with first honors as
Claire Shelby. Claude Laßelle, in
a minor role, won the applause of
the evening by a long and effective
scene in pantomime, in which he
tidies up the room. Rosemary De
Camp, by intelligent use of detail,
made Susie Lynde, the innocence
expert, something more than the
stock character babyface.
But unfortunately Raymond
Iluizlip pulled the whole play out
of focus by overplaying the im
portant character of John Shelby
beyond all semblance of a human
being. Gordon Davis's direction of
stage movement was particularly
good in the party scene, hut he
should have done something about
Mr. Ilaizlip. Fred Stover's set was
in excellent Montparnasse taste,
even the wallpaper.
The plot: Two mismated couples,
in adjoining rooms in a Paris hotel,
after much bickering and slow dawn
of realization, shift about to two
mated couples, which leads one
character to remark, "After all,
we're just one big happy family,
aren't we?" —Brauns

THE LEFT BANK (Rice)
At the Fairmont Playhouse
Elmer Rice's play leaves one be
iuddled as to what it is all about.
One witnesses a series of debates on
the relative merits of France and
America, frank American tourists
and turncoat American Frenchmen,
monogamy and polygamy, spiritual
freedom and "practical life," mod
ern educational methods and "the
child's place in the home." Although
Rice expresses himself in favor of
America, monogamy, less spiritual
freedom, and old educational meth
ods, he gives too little time to any
one.- subject to make it seem really
giipping or even important.
All the debates are smoothly
linked together, along with a Bo
hemian party and a pleasant se
uction, in the easy and natural
Kice manner of realistic detail.
The man is a remarkable techni
cian.
If one wants an accurate and usu
sually interesting three-act picture
of life in thelstudent's Paris, one will
find it in The Left Bank. But one
will not find the dramatic force of
"Street Scene" or "Counsellor-at-
Law."
Davis and McGraw give it a spir
ited production, with Jean Scott,
natural and intensely sincere, easily
walking off with first honors as
Claire Shelby. Claude Laßelle, in
a minor role, won the applause of
the evening by a long and effective
scene in pantomime, in which he
tidies up the room. Rosemary De
Camp, by intelligent use of detail,
made Susie Lynde, the innocence
expert, something more than the
stock character babyface.
But unfortunately Raymond
Iluizlip pulled the whole play out
of focus by overplaying the im
portant character of John Shelby
beyond all semblance of a human
being. Gordon Davis's direction of
stage movement was particularly
good in the party scene, hut he
should have done something about
Mr. Ilaizlip. Fred Stover's set was
in excellent Montparnasse taste,
even the wallpaper.
The plot: Two mismated couples,
in adjoining rooms in a Paris hotel,
after much bickering and slow dawn
of realization, shift about to two
mated couples, which leads one
character to remark, "After all,
we're just one big happy family,
aren't we?" —Brauns
