# TOO MUCH HARMONY
## 
### 
(Paramount) at the Stanford
When Bing Crosby, a revue star,
heard Judith Allen singing "The Day
You Cijmo Along" in a small-town

theatre, he knows that he has found
his new leading lady—on the stage
and in his heart. But he has not
counted upon a series of heart
breaking misfortunes, due to the
machinations of sinuous Lil Tash
man and innocent Jack Oakie who
loves Judith. Fortunately Oakie
sees that Judith loves Bing and so
he tenderly renounces his love and
compromises Tashman into releas
ing Bing from his promises. Thus
the picture ends on a happy note,
though one caririot help but feel sor
ry for Oakie.
Besides the plot, the picture is
replete with chorus numbers and
songs of which "Thanks," "The
Day You Came Along," and
"Bucking the Wind" are the fa
vorites. Eddie Sutherland in di
recting the musical number kept
them to the stage where they be
long, rather than permitting the
camera to wander down streets of
forgotten men or into the Stock
Exchange.
The picture offers an interesting
romance, laughs, good music, and
charming routine. It is good light
entertainment, and features Bing
Crosby, a radio and movie singer,
supported by winsome Judith Allen,
a former wife of Gus Sonnenberg.
