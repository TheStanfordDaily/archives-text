WHAT'S WRONG WITH
lI.S.C.'S OPPONENTS?
This writer would like to know
why so many of the University of
Southern California's more brilliant
athletic accomplishments are inva
riably accompanied by an odor, very
foul and peculiar in nature. Their
f.reat coaches, namely Howard Jones
and Dean Cromwell, are by self
avowal and reputation sportsmen
of the first water, men who would
never countenance deliberately some
of the aberrations of which S.C. is
collectively accused by their more
vehement rivals.
Their athletes ought to be on a
par with athletes of other institu
t'ons, both mentally, normally, and
physically, else they ought not to be
.students and athletes of any school.
Jones, Cromwell, and "Elevator
Sam" Barry ought to be the gentle
men and sportsmen we naturally as
sume them to be, or else they ought
not to be coaches, of any school, in
trusted with the delicate task of for
mation of "character" in the youth
of America. Even if these gentle
men were prone to resort to unfair
tactics for Ihe sake of a victory, they
surely realize that their teams boast
of too much man-power to make
any such phony stuff necessary.
And the authorities behind the
c< aches, if they have the mental
acumen to be in a position of au
thority, surely possesses the horse
sense to realize that questionable
acts are certain to rebound to the
discredit of their schools, taking the
long run of affairs into consideration.
Studying this aspect of the sit
uation, it seems incredible that the
Trojans with all their prestige and
"honor of the sport" sort of thing
which naturally accrues to title
holders, should ever be anything:
else but the best and the fairest and
Ihe finest of sportsmen.
Yet why are unfortunate occur- (
rences always blowing out of their j
appearances on the field and courts'
Are their opponents just sour losers,
(|tiiek to grasp at any retaliatory
straws; is it impossible to stage ama
teur sports without constant bick
erings; or docs the old saw hold
true, "Where there is a lot of smoke,
there is always some fire?"
Here are a few remembrances of
"squawks" made by members of the
opposition party after the contest
noted.
Stanford-S.C. football game of 1928.
Stanford-S.C. track meet of 1931.
Notre Dame-S.C. football game of
1931.
Loyola-S.C. football game of 1932.
Loyola-S.C. football game of 1933.
St. Mary's-S.C. football game of;
1933.
Stanford-S.C. track meet of 1929.
In each of these meetings post
game rumblings and mutterings, 1
some private and some published,
ensued as a result of referee's deci
sions that directly affected the out-
come of the game.
Surely our sympathies are not
with the newspaper "greats" from
Moraga, who had their ears properly
smacked down Saturday, at least to
our notion. Yet the thing as usual,
smells extremely fishy.
