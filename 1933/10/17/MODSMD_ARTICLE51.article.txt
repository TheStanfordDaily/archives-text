victorious frosh gridders brought
first-hand news of last Saturday's
heartbreaking, last minute-loss to
the S.C. Trobabes.
Outgaining the Trojans and com
pletely bottling up Keller and other
of their star backs, (he Stanford
freshmen clearly had the upper
hand throughout the game. Twice
they fought their way down tu. the
S.C. goal line only to be stopped
once on the three-yard line and
again on the five-yard stripe.
Said Jeff Cravath, S.C. coach, to
his charges after the game, "You
fellow's didn't win that game; it was
I handed to you as the result of a
lucky break." The said lucky break
occurred in the last two minutes of
play when a long S.C. pass was
caught by the Stanford §afety man
momentarily only to slip out of his
j hands into the waiting arms of a
! l'ortunately-placed Trojan.

team's efforts toward successfully
completing the balance of the sea
son.
On November 11 the freshmen

Arriving from Southern Califor
nia yesterday morning. Coach
Jimmie Bradshaw and his almost
victorious frosh gridders brought
first-hand news of last Saturday's
heartbreaking, last minute-loss to
the S.C. Trobabes.
Outgaining the Trojans and com
pletely bottling up Keller and other
of their star backs, (he Stanford
freshmen clearly had the upper
hand throughout the game. Twice
they fought their way down tu. the
S.C. goal line only to be stopped
once on the three-yard line and
again on the five-yard stripe.
Said Jeff Cravath, S.C. coach, to
his charges after the game, "You
fellow's didn't win that game; it was
I handed to you as the result of a
lucky break." The said lucky break
occurred in the last two minutes of
play when a long S.C. pass was
caught by the Stanford §afety man
momentarily only to slip out of his
j hands into the waiting arms of a
! l'ortunately-placed Trojan.
