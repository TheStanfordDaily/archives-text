# CANDIDATES FOR 1933 TRACK TEAM WILL COMPETE IN PRACTICE MEET ON FRIDAY
## 
### 
A practice meet Friday and a
meeting of freshman candidates
Wednesday evening, together with
the regular daily workouts, consti
tute this week's program for Stan
ford's half hundred track and field
men.
Coach Bill Ellington -has sched
uled an organization meeting for his
first-year men in Room 41, Board
of Athletic Control Building, Wed
nesday at 7:15 o'clock. He urges all
frosh interested in track competi
tion to attend. Besides the group
that is already working out, he ex
pects a large delegation from the
gridiron.
Friday's meet will serve as the
first time trial of the year for the
track men, and the first official rec
ord of all jumpers, weight tossers,
and runners will be made on the
basis of this competition.
It is too early still to make ac
curate predictions as to the Indian
strength, but Coach Dink Temple
ton should have a fairly well bal
anced squad, with at least limited
power in nearly every event.
The 440-yard dash may be fair,
but material in this event is limited
to such an extent that a relay com
bination may cause Templeton some
difficulties.
Stanford tutors are still undecided
as to where they will run Chuck
Nimmo, frosh mile sensation of last
spring. He may be called upon for
two races this year.
With Captain Gus Meier and
Kingsbury teaming with several
promising newcomers, worries are
slight in the hurdle department.
The field events each have one or
two lettermen, but one or two of
these divisions are noticeable by a
lack of new material. Phil Williams
and Paul Zaches are expected to
carry the broad jumping burden,
Lie yd Schween and Don Albertson
should go well in the high jump,
and Bud Deacon is counted on heav

| ily in the pole vault.
Gordon "Slinger"' Dunn and John
ny Lyman, the two remaining mem
bers of the famed Behemoth quar
| tet of last season, will team with
Johnny Mottram to head the list of
weight men.
