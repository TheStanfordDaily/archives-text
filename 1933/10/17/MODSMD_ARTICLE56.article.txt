# Sale of Concert Series Tickets Proceeds Slowly
## 
### 
Although the Concert Series is
being better supported this year
than in the last few years, still only
14.3 per cent of the student body
have bought tickets.
The pitiful figures: 83 tickets at
$4 have been sold among the stu
dents, 219 at $3, and 171 at $2, the
lowest priced tickets.
Koble has made the best showing
so far with Encina, Union, Sequoia,
To>on, and Branner following in
order.
The fraternities seem the least
promising, their poor support being
probably due to insufficient can
vassing. The sororities have been
coming through fairly well.
Says Prentice Messimer, manager:
"When only 485 students out of 3,300
buy tickets for this series, I feel that
the student body as a whole is miss
ing an opportunity at these prices."
