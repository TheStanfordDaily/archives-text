# TENNIS CAMPAIGN FOR YEAR OPENS; 4 VETERANS BACK
## 
### Julius Jacobs 
Beginning a campaign that will
end only next spring quarter, with
the important Conference matches,
Stanford's tennis playing exponents
begin their warm-up campaign next
week.
First four men on last year's var
sity, all veterans, are exempt from
challenge matches. They are Chuck
Gti.s, Sam Lee, who has temporarily
dropped tennis in favor of studies,
Johnny (Doe) Law, and Glenn Reed.
Next two plyying positions on
first varsity will be competed for
by approximately 20 racket men,
many of them line players on last
year's frosh, some not so good.
It seems a certainty, however,
tliat chuckling Monty Schwaydcr
will cinch one of the two places,
and Ondy Martin the other, un
less a cyclone or Jack Lynch from
Taft J.C. enters the varsity courts
to create havoc with tennis rank
ings.
Freshmen draw is finished and
listed on the men's bulletin board in
the gym. First round matches must
be begun this week, whether the
babes are seeded, unseeded, or have
neither qualification.
A novice tournament list is being
drawn up for all classes in the Uni
versity, excluding frosh. All men
but those who have won letters or
numerals for tennis, may sign up.
Competition will be keen, and the
three winners rewarded well for
victory in their class. «•'
