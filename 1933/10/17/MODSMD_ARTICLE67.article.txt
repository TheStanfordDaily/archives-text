# DONATED DENTISTS TO EXAMINE NEW STUDENTS' TEETH
## 
### 
You'll have to see your dentist,
1 Mr. New Student, for although you
i don't know it yet you probably have
I three good reasons in the form of
I cavities or other deficiencies requir
ing attention. This is the case of the
: average newcomer to Stanford, ac
| cording to figures compiled by the
Health Service authorities from last
year's dental examinations. This
quarter's consulations begin today.
Five hundred new men were ex
; amined last year, and more than
! 1.000 are expected to report this fall
1 in answer to appointments made at
the time of preliminary physical ex
aminations. Despite the fact that
many had visited dentists shortly
before coming to Stanford, the av
-1 erage number of deficiencies per
| student at that time was more than
i three, according to Dr. C. E. Shepard
of the Health Service.
Six members of the faculty of
i Stanford's dental school, a division
loi the College of Physicians and
I Surgeons in San Francisco, will
1 make the examinations. The con
sultations were inaugurated last
year when the dental school do
| naled a chair and sterilized together
: with the services of faculty mem
! bers.
No charge is made either to the
[student or the University for the
' service. Diagnosis only is made of
the individual case, the student be
inc advised to choose a private den
tist for treatment when it is neces
! sary.
