# Engineer Society to Hold Open House Tomorrow
## 
### 
Open house will be held by the
Mechanical Engineering Society at
| 7:15 o'clock tomorrow evening for
freshmen engineers and others in
terested in the equipment of the Me
j chanical Engineering laboratories.
Conducted as a tour of inspection,
the "open house" will start at the
heat and power laboratory across
from the Bookstore.
Among the places of interest to be
viewed are the experimental wind
tunnel of the Guggenheim Aeronau
tical Laboratory (in operation);
! gauge blocks, accurate to three-mil
lionths of ap inch; shadow projector
and machine for seeing one ten-thou
sandths of an inch; and a strobo
scope attached to a water turbine
t( enable one to see "still" pictures
of the moving buckets while the
wheel is running.
The Vibration Laboratory in
which "artificial earthquakes" are
| produced will also be open for in
| spection.
i Lastly, the Heat and Power Lab
oratory will be operating the more
important machines, such as the
high compression Ford engine, the
natural gas engine, the new refrig
erating unit, the steam engine, and
the air compressor.
"Keep out of the next war. Ger
many has kicked the dead carcass
of the disarmament conference."—
