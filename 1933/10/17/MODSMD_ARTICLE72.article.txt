# New Hours Go Into Effect At Women's Gym Today
## 
### 
The office of the Women's Gym
announced yesterday a change in
hours to take effect immediately.
The new time is to be from 9-12
o'clock and from 1:30-5 o'clock
daily.
These times replace the old hours
of 8:30-12 o'clock and 1-5 o'clock,
formerly effective at the gym. The
change has been necessitated by the
fact that the staff has been unable
to finish their work each day be
cause they have constantly been in
terrupted by students requiring at
tention.
