# Anxious Parents Await Nameless Cards in P. O.
## 
### 
What's in a name? Evidently
a good deal in the eyes of some
Stanford students. The lobby of
the post office is at present dec
orated with a number of post
cards written home by consci
entious students, but it seems
that the urge which impelled
those people to write home was
satisfied at the conclusion of the
message written on the front of
the card; for the back bears no
address.
Undoubtedly Helen An n,
Nancy, Helene, Bob, and two
Berts are going to be deeply in
jured when they discover that
(heir respective families have
not received the carefully writ
ten but unaddressed cards. Per
haps it might be well to glance
at the board and see if your last
message home is there.
