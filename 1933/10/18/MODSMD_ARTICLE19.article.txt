# EX COMMITTEE NAMES GODFREY FOR GRAD POST
## Plans Made for Axe Rites At Big Game; Plaque Already Ordered 
### 
A.S.S.U. Ex Committee members
I last night met iri weekly session and
| conducted an exhaustive survey of
themselves. Completing an inter
esting evening of oratory, intense
discussion, shrewd badinage hurled
across the long mahogany table lit
li red with candies, at approximately
9:14. The Ex Committee reached
perfect understanding.
Most important business of the
evening was the appointment of Bud
Godfrey, last year's Senior Ball
| Chairman, to Graduate Member of
!Ex Committee, succeeding Cotto
i Herbert, who has accepted a city
position and will not be available
for active work on the committee.
Basis of the entii-e parley came
about as the result of reading a re
port questioning advisability of more
j varied and intensive investigation
cf school, matters by the committee.
Probe Report Heard
As aforementioned moment of
1 perfect harmony was finally reached,
! this report was referred to Student
' Manager Les Hables with the rec
i ommendation that he consider it in
j carrying out the business of his of-
I ficial position.
Notable in many respects, perhaps
II he greatest achievement of many
! quarters transpired when President
i Trautman opened the meeting, and
j leading of roll disclosed the amaz
j ing fact that every member was
1 present but Bruce Tarver, who is
|on the train speeding home with
| Thornhill'.s football men.
Trautman Congratulated
Charley Karl, experienced vet
' eran of last year's Executive Body,
! came up to the President's chair at
[ the close of the meeting and con
■ gratulated Trautman on holding the
! best meeting he had ever attended.
1 Extreme appeal of Tuesday's ses-
I sion was manifested by two sorority
I members of the body. They sacri
| ficed a jolly-up at their house in
! favor of parliamentary procedure.
Student Manager Hables opposed
the holding of a Big Game Jolly-Up
on the ground that it would decrease
the Big Game fervor of the students
in the rooting section.
Axe Ceremony Planned
I Stanford's famous Axe also en
tered into plans for a large enter
i tainment against U.C. It is to be
i mounted on a plaque for which $35
I was appropriated. At conclusion of
i the game, with fitting solemnity, and
! with appropriate rites, four major
! sports captains of Stanford will cs
jcort the axe in its journey to mid
field, where it will be presented to
the winning school.
An amusing situation developed
! when Ex Committee granted three
' sorority dates for the same night,
J November 18. Row females will en
' ter into feverish activity for desir
| £ ble dates, with the tables momen
tarily turned, and men in demand
j for that night.
Jones on Rally Group
Third and final resignation on
Rally Committee personnel occurred
j when Duncan Mcßryde sent in his
; intention to retire from the Com
| n:ittee. As a result, names were
suggested, and after elimination,
I Bob Jones, newly appointed night
! editor on the Stanford Daily, was
chosen to fill the vacancy for the
year.
Joe Fessio, Cardinal debater, was
j named to succeed Wayne Bannister
joi Men's Council. Bannister is
: forensic member of Chapin's debate
j squad, graduated last June and not
j available for the council.
Campus Posters Scored
Advertising on the campus came
: in for its share of comment with de-
I cision that all signs littering tele
j phone poles and trees in the vicinity
|of the campus must be destroyed
j after their purpose has been ob-
I tained. Ire of beauty loving com
| in it tee members decided this reform.
Scabbard and Blade, evidently
! peeved by the fact that their bid
for Military Ball, was ignored a year
1 Ego, took all possible precautions
when they sent in their request for
a date to be given them next March,
j This advance date was assured them.
