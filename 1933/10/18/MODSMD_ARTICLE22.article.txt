# ICHIHASHI TALKS ON NEW JAPAN
## Oriental Savant Describes Tokyo Night Life 
### 
"Jazz is not limited to the west
ern world only; Tokyo has its jazz
as well as its crooners," stated Dr.
Yamato Ichihashi in his lecture last
night on "Ancient and Modern Ja
pan." The Japanese historian went
on to say the Japanese had given
up the plan of rising and going to
bed with the sun, and that night
life in Tokyo was one of its cosmo
politan features. Both American and
Japanese women, the latter often in
Japanese dress, are to be seen.
In Tokyo the only part that re
mains from the old city is the stone
wall that surrounds the palace; the
lest of the city is like any western
metropolis. The military section of
the government is now in the back
ground, and the newspapers have
regained their former freedom.
Students Disttirbors
Students form one of the main
sources of disturbances at the pres
ent time. Only the sons and daugh
ters of the upper class gp to the
universities, of which there are
some 20 in Tokyo, and the better
their social status, the more radical
they seem to be. Each student
seems to feel it a part of his edu
cation to spend some of his college
life in jail.
Dr. Ichihashi mentioned broad
casting. He said that it is all con
trolled by the government and that
no advertising whatsoever is al
lowed to be carried on.
Temples Discussed
The ancient temples that are just
a few miles from the ancient capi
tal of Japan, Nara, were discussed
at some length by the professor. He
told of one temple, composed of
some 20 buildings, where there are
standing today, almost intact, three
of the oldest civilized wooden struc
tures in the world. These buildings
were built some time in the middle
of the seventh century and are just
as good as they ever were. These
structures are a five-storied pagoda,
the Golden Hall, and the gate lead
ing to the Temple.
Dr. Ichihashi closed his lecture
with a statement of the feeling of
the Japanese toward Western inter
vention. He said that, Japan wants
no more western intervention in the
affairs of the Far East, but "if any
one wants to interfere, just let him
try!" Japan is prepared,
