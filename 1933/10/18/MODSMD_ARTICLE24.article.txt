# Hitler Wants German Peace, Believes Lutz
## Stanford Authority Scouts Prediction of War 
### Will Williams 
"I doubt if Germany will re-arm
without an agreement with allied
powers," declared Stanford's much
interviewed Hoover War Library
Chairman, Dr. Ralph Haswell Lutz,
consenting yesterday afternoon to
make another of his commentaries
on German diplomatic relations.
"But 'National Security' is not a
bad term for what Germany is seek
i ing," Dr: Lutz continued. "Having
withdrawn from the League, her
position is precarious. She signed
j the present 'security' pact and the
Locarno pact, which are a part of
the framework of the League, and
Ihe question now arises as to the
future of these agreements."
War Held Unlikely
Asked if war was imminent, Dr.
! Lutz chuckled, reminisced about
perennial predictions of conflict.
"One of my students set the date
for me last year," he said.
"Hitler has twice declared him*
J self in favor of peaceful methods—
in his speech to the Reichstag May
jJ 6 and in his recent address. No
j statesman can very well repudiate
i h'mself after taking so definite a
stand. Not only that, war would be
suicide for Germany right now;
they'd just be darned fools, that's
all."
"No Cause for Alarm"
From Hitler's standpoint, with
drawal from the League followed
logically upon his diplomatic pol
icy. According to Dr. Lutz, Hitler
expects a counter proposal from the
i allied nations. "In any event, the
Locarno agreement will most prob
ably stand."
"Hitler doubtless thinks of him
self as a great leader. Certainly he
;is sincere. He believes in peace,
but there is a possibility that he
i will be confronted by his support
i crs with a demand for 'National Sc
i curity,' which implies re-armament.
Indeed the only danger lies in what
ever pressure may be exerted upon
j him by his supporters. Candidly I
do not think there is any cause for
j alarm," concluded Dr. Lutz, "for
, military action would be a confes
sion that, Germany's policies could
only be carried out on the field of
I terror. This would contradict their
' established principles."
