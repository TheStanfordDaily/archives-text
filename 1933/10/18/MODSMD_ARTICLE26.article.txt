## 
### 
Sight-seeing tourists, making the |
rounds of Carmel, Hollywood, and j
other California show places, have j
built a tradition around the '95 daks j
plate in front of Stanford's Memo- j
rial Church.
Everything depends upon whether ,
said tourist is a Democrat or Re
publican. The former, when told
that 2 the '95 class plate represents j
the group with which Herbert Hoo-i
ver was graduated, steps on it. with !
an expression of malice. The latter
treads sacredly, proudly, and goes 1
back home to tell the folks that it
will bring him good luck.
This is just one of the idyosyn
cifsies displayed by Stanford's tour
ist traffic which congests within the j
Memorial court to the tune of about
150 to 300 per day. Student Guide
Edwin Gerhardt, when he isn't
going In law classes, spends his time

answering questions of German
bankers and Arkansas oil million
aires.
The blond tourist conductor, now
in his fourth year at the job, re
ports the Stanford sight-seers as a
curious, generous, and friendly
cowd. They want to know every
thing. What kind of an institution
this is half of them don't realize
t liitt Stanford is a university. Whore
the Church is—even when they arc
staring at it. Where Hoover lives—
says Gerhardt, "If the Memorial
Church and Hoover's home were
built side by side, we'd have to
have a squad of police to keep the
crowds in order."
Gerhardt believes that the sight
seers leave Stanford, knowing more
iibout its buildings, history, and tra
dition than do the students them
selves.
