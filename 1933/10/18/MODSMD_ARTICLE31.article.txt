# Welcome, Norman Thomas
## 
### 
The Winds of Freedom still blow. They welcome to the
Assembly Hall this afternoon Norman Thomas—Socialist
and man. Since 1928, the incarnation of the Socialist party,
Thomas speaks not as a politician, today but as a student.
Hut with Socialists, the two are synonymous. That is
what makes Socialists so interesting. Socialists never win
elections or (almost never outside of Milwaukee). They
never hope to— at least not within the immediate future.
Never hoping", they never try to. Because they do not try
to win elections, they can afford to be absolutely honest.
This is what makes listening to Norman Thomas such
a fascinating experience. He can speak without offending
an "Old Guard'" or a "Solid South" in his party. The So
cialists have neither. He never is afraid to insult voters,
because the very word socialist—insults millions of vot
ers anyway. He is fearless because he is a philosopher.
One has to be a philosopher to be a Socialist.
They work in the vineyard and never pick any of the
grapes. They never get a chance to pick because as soon
as a Socialist grape becomes ripe, the Republicans or the
Democrats do the picking. In fact, the two old parties pick
the grapes, suck them dry, and spit the seeds in the Social
ist back yard. This has been the history over and over
again. The Socialists build up a good idea only to sice it
stolen by their opposition.
That usually breaks up a political party. But not the
Socialists. They are not a political party. They are an
educational institution. They take another idea, and an
other.
And at the head of this educational institution sits Pro
fessor Norman Thomas who every four years runs for
President of the United States as the best way to get his
lectures before the people.
Hut Thomas is a speaker who actually thrills his audi
ence and sends them away, be they bloated capitalists or
starving proletariat, with a deep emotional experience.
Jlc is tall and angular like Abraham Lincoln, and
speaks with the simplicity, humor, and sincerity that made
the backwoods lawyer a national sensation.
Stanford is honored to listen to Norman Thomas, So
cialist, and Norman Thomas, man big, human, and in
spiring.
