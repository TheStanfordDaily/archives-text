One of the interesting things about life in a great uni
versity is the multiplicity of activity. On the same evening
there may be play trvouts, an executive committee meet
ing, :i conclave of sports managers, a debate, and football
signals practice. Day and night the campus is humming'
with extracurricular activity.
The moral to students still not yet seniors is to become
part of this interesting life that is going on all around them.
Ten years from now it will be more exciting to think back (
about the debate with Cal, or the basketball game with J
T.S.C., or the brilliant editorial you wrote for Chaparral, i
than to remember that Professor Whatsis gave you a R-f
-in elementary geology.
Taking part in an activity need not result in a slighting
of the academic life. "Getting on the boat" requires only \
a part of the student's spare time. The compensation in
new interests and new friendships is well worth it.
