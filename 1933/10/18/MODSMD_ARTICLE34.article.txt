### THE BLUE EAGLE A BUZZARD 
The Blue Eagle hasn't laid any
golden eggs. To put it bluntly, the
country is in a hell of a shape.
Millions are unemployed, millions
are destitute. Faith, hope, and char
ity have buoyed up the American
people so far, but this winter the
Roosevelt administration must pro
duce tangible results. Signs, slogans,
and four-minute speeches will not
bo accepted as substitutes for coal
and bread.
Americans are so used to luxury,
and so little awed by law and gov
ernment, that if conditions do not
greatly improve there is an excel
lent chance for a blow-up. Unlike
Europeans or Orientals, we will not
for long supinely accept discomfort.
If real results ax*e not soon pro
duced, it will be suspected that the
New Deal, like the old one, j-esults
in jack-pots for those who know the
dealers and a freeze-out for those
who do not. Too many people have
no chips left.
If the NRA, and inflation, and the
rest of the desperate measures the
administration may try all fail, it
probably means the end of govern
ment as we know it. To the older
generation, this must be a terrifying
possibility. It is hard to see the
world that they have lived in for
so long, and helped create, fall to
pieces. To the younger generation,
the crisis may be a stimulation, a
tremendous opportunity to start a
new order, to build a new and fairer
society. The alternative is chaos.
Civilizations have fallen before. If
the present challenge is not met, it
is possible that there may be a com
plete collapse. Anarchy, millions

| starving, rule by gangster chieftains,
invasion, reversion to primitive
methods of production and barter—
these are not mere fantasies.
This is not to say that youth will
iead the world out of its difficulties.
Next to being told to follow the lead
of older and wiser men, the most
annoying thing to youth is being
told to take the lead itself. We are
nol "the hope of the world." Talk
[ about a "youth revolt" is nonsense.
Youth does not know how to save
the world that our elders have
wrecked. In their place we prob
ably would have wrecked it too.
What we can do is to learn how
to think, so that we will recognize
the right kind of leadership when it
appears, and know how to back it
up. If a struggle against capitalism
j were to take place in America, the
students, particularly in the aristo
cratic universities of the East, would
probably be on the side of the estab
lished order. Prejudice, snobbery,
and ignorance would play strong
roles.
| Students are beginning to think.
! They are beginning to realize that
i something is wrong with our politi
: cal system, and that the source of
1 corruption is economic, not personal.
They are beginning to see that the
method of distribution is wrong,
j When a leader comes who will
lead us to a better system —whether
j that leader be Roosevelt or anyone
else—the younger generation must
; know enough to recognize him and
! support him. The older generation
will not do it. If no one does it, our
j lives may hardly be worth living.
