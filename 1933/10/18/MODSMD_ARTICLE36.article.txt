The saga of the man who "done
her wrong" broke out at the Theta
house jolly-up last night when one
lof the girls was left flatter
Roble's front door-step by a rough
in the middle of the floor.
The woman in question pursued
the man clear across the floor to
1 tell him that he had to dance with
1 her until he was tagged or other
wise relieved of the responsibility.
| It's an old Stanford custom. So he
' danced.
His side of the story indicated that
somebody had bumped his shoulder
?nd said, ''Pardon, may I cut?" He
answered, "Certainly, thanks." The
letter was to the young lady. And
he strode away to newer conquests,
j But the catch appeared in the fact
that he had been bumped acci-
I dentally, and the query as to possi
bilities of cutting was addressed to
! someone else.
