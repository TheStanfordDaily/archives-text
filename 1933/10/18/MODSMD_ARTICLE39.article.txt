MIDNIGHT CLUB AN!) MELODY
OKUISE, At the Varsity Theatre
"Midnight Club" is probably the
only film on record in which three
of the players have doubles, and
the result is highly entertaining,
ii a little baffling. Clivc Brook,
Helen Vinson, and Alan Mowbray
—three excellent players—appear
as drawing-room crooks who have
doubles, in order to establish an
alibi when they are out on "a
job," I believe the term is.
Into the thick of things walks
George Raft, who is—of all things—
a detective. But no ordinary detec
tive, George; he forthwith joins
fcices with the crooks in order to
(a) bring them to speedy .justice—
which he had planned, and (b) fall
in love with Miss Vinson —which he
h«d not planned.
Raft is not quite so greasy a.s
usual, so perhaps you will be able
to stand a good deal of him; or per
haps you like him?
As a matter of fact, this film has
all the requisites of good enter
tainment. and entertainment it is.
The dialog is splendid, as are all
the players. Clive Brook and Miss
Vinson bear the major burden of
the acting with consummate ease,
and Alan Mowbray turns in one of
his unfailingly smooth perform
ances, while Alison Skipworth ap
pears all too briefly.
"Melody Cruise" is a trivial affair,

as you may have guessed by the
listing of tlie cast: Phil Harris, Char
lie Ruggles, and Greta Nissen—
which combination indicates consid
erable singing, comedy, and seduc
tiveness. —Chapin
WHAT PRICE INNOCENCE? and
THE CROOKED CIRCLE
At the California Theatre
A mystery story and a story deal
ing with The Truth About It All
vie with each other on 1 his double
bill, which is about as anachronistic
a one as could be devised.
"What Price Innocence?" is a
saccharine treatment about two
misguided, poorly acted, and flea
wilted parents who didn't Tell
daughter until Too Late. The ii
nale of the iilm is typical of the
entire treatment: picture of the
front door of the girl's house,
draped with large black wreath;
from the distance, mother's sobs:
"Why didn't I tell her?"
i "The Crooked Circle'' has two
very definite assets in the persons
of Sazu Pitts and Jimmie Gleason, as
clever a pair of comedians *as one
* could ask for. And Ihey are thor
oughly in (heir element in this yarn
about walking skeletons, trapdoors,
subterranean passages, and appear
ing and disappearing corpses, and
give considerable verve to an other
wise conventional "shiver" film.
