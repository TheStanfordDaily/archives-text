# Wheat Embargo
## 
### 
Social "LV-perirnenting North Da
kota is trying another one. In an
effort to raise wheat price Governor
St anger has clapped on a wheat
embargo effective Wednesday. North
Dakota raises 12 per cent of U.S.
wheat; A. A. A. - baiter Stanger,
therefore, tried to get support from
neighboring wheat-state Governors.
So far three had refused, one kept
quiet on advice of attorney-general,
two lurked, listening for the voice
of the people. Alarmed North Da
kota wheat owners were getting
theirs out of the state. Quoth the
Governor: something to aid the
grain farmer might come out of it.
