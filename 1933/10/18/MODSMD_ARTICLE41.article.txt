# STINER CHEERFULLY BREAKS CONVENTIONS
## 
### 
Lon Stiner of the Oregon men is
no conservative man. He pulled two
very unorthodox stunts against the
Dons, using an eight.-man line oc
casionally on offense, and pulling a
guard back into the second paired
backs of a 6-2-2-1 defense.
Stiner's substitution methods are
also radically different from stormy
Coach Paul Schissler who used to
stage a parade of replacements hik
ing in and out of the game. Satur
day the Oregonians used but 12
men in the entire game. One sub
stitute ought to be a record—for the
modern brand of ball.
