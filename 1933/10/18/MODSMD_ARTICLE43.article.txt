# ORCHIDS TO DON LIEBENDORFER
## 
### 
Our man Don Liebendorfer, af- j
fable director of publicity for the
B.A.C. and the University, got or- i
chid.s from the Chicago newsmen, j
Quoting Henry L. Farrell of the j
News:
"Don Liebendorfer says it is the j
perfect squad and that it is a fam- j
ily secret that the squad thinks it I
can take Southern California.
"Don was telling some journalis- j
tic giants—Grant Rice, Dick Hy- i
land, and Paul Gallico—about the j
squad last night. He is a publicity j
man who doesn't wink when he j
talks and who doesn't punctuate
with a lot of 'you knows' and 'get
me's?'"
They asked Liebendorfer if the j
team had any handsome boys who \
were going Hollywood.
"Funny thing about that," Don
st id. "We have one on the squad j
who is a dead ringer for Clark Ga- i
ble. He's Monk Moscrip. And the |
funny thing is that none of us de- ;
tected the striking resemblance un
til the squad came to Chicago. Then |
a girl in the hotel pointed to him j
and said: 'There's Clark Gable. Oh, j
dear! . .
