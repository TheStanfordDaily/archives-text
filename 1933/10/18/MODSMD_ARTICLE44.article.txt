# HORSE OF TROY LEADS HARD LIFE

### 
Is it possible that good old El Tro
jan is not garnering the top cream of
southern California athletes any
more? You remember last year the
Stanford frosh whipped S.C. badly,
albeit a number of the Trobabes
were ineligible. This year the In
dian yearlings were unlucky to lose,
after actually outplaying S.C. for
four quarters. â€”Hamilton
