# Gridders Arrive Today to Prepare for S.F.U.
## THORNHILL PLANS NEW PLAYS TO AID CARDS IN SCORING 
### 
i The Stanford Indians will blow in
from the corn-fed regions of the
J Middle West today, scrub the traf
j fie grime from their ruddy hides,
and make themselves at home for
i a week. After a brief stay, they
j will be off to the wars again, jour
neying this time north to Seattle
and the Washington Huskies.
But the immediate attention of the
tribe will be directed to the dis
posal of San Francisco's Dons who
t>re guided by this here now young
fellow, "Spud" Lewis, the former
Stanford back who learned his
coaching from "Pop" Warner, with
a post-graduate course under Dick
Hanley at Northwestern.
Dons Yet to Win
This Stanford team is undergoing
a peculiar schedule. Last week they
were rated heavy favorites to de
feat a team that plays Warner foot
ball, and now they are similarly
rrted heavy favorites over a team
that plays the same type of football,
coached by a former member of the
Northwestern coaching staff.
Despite the fact that S.F.U. has
not yet won a game, they are a sux*e
enough strong team, banked with a
'heavy line which includes the vet
i eran Siemering at center and a
j couple of good ends in Hinch and
i Wilson. Wilson was injured last Sat
! urday and will probably not be in
| the contest against the Cards.
New Warner Shifts
Lewis has installed a new system
! of plays this season, which includes
j a few variations of the latest War
! nor line shift. Lewis had some good
j backs to run these plays, notably
' Jim Hall, but the latter has gone and
j got himself declared ineligible, and
I that put a nick in the attacking
j ecige. that doesn't make Lewis feel
j better. ;
Thornhill is expected to sketch
! out some new plays for his men
} which they will start work on in the
I fit st practice, but it is unlikely that
I they will be able to do anything
i with them before the Washington
1 game. t
( Anyway, if a team does not
| possess the timing and the block
; ing to make the old reliable plays
| work for a few yards occasionally,
< there is no use fiddling with fancy
i stuff. Observers of the Soldier's |
| Field epic reported that the Car
! dinals lacked the timing and pol
'â–  ish that the complicated Warner
I plays demand.
