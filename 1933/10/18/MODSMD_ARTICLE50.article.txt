# FROSH GRID TEAM CONCENTRATES ON BLOCKING, OFFENSE
## 
### 
Good blocking, prime fundamen
tal of any winning football team,
| was stressed yesterday as the up
| and coming frosh grid team con
i tinued to polish off its improving
! offense.
With most of their plays already
; learned, ihf main task facing the
; freshmen is to perfect their attack
and all-round playing ability for
i the four none-too-easy games re
! mpining on the schedule.
Four More Games
( Exactly half-way through their
] eight-game season, the Babes have
| yet to face, on successive Sutur
i days, Menlo Junior College, Santa
| Clara freshmen, Jose State
freshmen, and, topping off the sea
i son, the California Cubs.
Previous on the frosh
! schedule include 7-6 victories ever
j San Mateo and Modesto J.C., a 56-0
| slaughter of Armstrong Business
| College, and last Saturday's near
| victory against the Southern Cali
i fornia freshmen.
Injuries Not Serious
l Injuries to three of Coach Brad
shaw's first-string players proved
! rict-so-serious last night as two of
them reported to practice. Fred
Williams, field goal expert of the
squad, was sufficiently recovered
from a -strained muscle to practice
at his specialty of booting the bail
i through the cross-bars.
Ray Williamson was the other in
jured man who turned out. Only
i Chuck Ledbetter, brawny, line
! smashing fullback failed to show up.
A broken blood vessel in his right
hand has laid Ledbetter up for a
few days but he, along with Wil
liams and Williamson, is expected to
be for action against Menlo
Saturday.
Bergman, Quails Even
Still battling it out for the first
string center berth, George Berg
man and Ralph Quails are consid
ered practically even choices for the
job. Bergman started the S.C. game ,
with Quails playing all the second
half. Both will probably see plenty
of service Saturday.
Lewis Tsoutsouvas and Dale Bee
die, first-string tackles, both were i
given credit for outstanding play;
against S.C. Beedle, who hails from |
down Miami, Arizona, way. is said)
to have turned in one of the finest
games ever played by a Stanford
freshman tackle.
Coach Elwyn Bugge requests that
i the first eight men on the varsity
i tennis squad, meet with him today
|on the varsity courts, at 4 o'clock
to discuss certain tennis matters.
