# Sequoia Hop Features Bar
## 
### 
A shiny new bar is being set up J
in Sequoia Hall for the convenience j
of patrons of the Hallowe'en dance |
there Friday night, it has been dis- j
closed by Dante Lembi, chairman i
of the affair.
The liquid which will flow freely ,
across this novel addition, to the ;
Stanford campus, however, will be
nothing but ice cold cider and
punch, harmless but cooling.
Hallowe'en atmosphere is also
promised with the use of innumer
able pumpkins, cornstalks, and the
like. A1 Rushton's orchestra is
scheduled to furnish the music.
Relatively few bids for the dance
are unsold, and these may be ob
tained in the A.S.S.U. office for 75
cents.
