"WHEN A FELLER
. .i there's cheer in good old Briggs!
Another football player may take your sig
nals, but there's no substitute for BRIGGS.
You could pay twice as much for other
tobaccos and find them not half so good.
BRIGGS is aged in the wood extra long.
It's mellowed and biteless. It's so good
that it won nation-wide popularity before
it had a line of advertising.
But it's easy to make a tobacco sound
grand in print. Smoking's what counts.
Won't you try a tin of BRIGGS?
15 rig OS Pipe Mixture is olso sold in 1-pound and
!i-pound tins . . . and in 1-pound Humidor Kegs.
