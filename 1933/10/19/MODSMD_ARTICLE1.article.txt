### 
Yesterday Geneva leaders said
Ihat Germany's return ,was the only
hope for the arms situation. Now,
Hitler has stated that Germany will
make no considerations unless
treated on an absolute parity. Eng
land and France could never think
of it. League leaders are searching
lor something else to be optimistic
about.
France continues to blame Ger
many for wrecking things.
England, in spite of Roosevelt's
firm hands off statements, is dis
cussing the possibilities of involving
America in Nazi withdrawal parley.
Mussolini, long silent, has at last
tried to assume the center of the
stage. He wants to pull off an arms
conference of his own in Italy.
The wee small voice of Denmark
has also been heard. She will de
fend her border "to the limit" in
case of German trouble.
