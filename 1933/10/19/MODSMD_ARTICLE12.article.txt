# Thomas Jovial After Speech
## Scorns Idea of War With Japan; Lauds F.D.R. 
### Rolph Malloch 
As jovial in private life as he is
serious on the speaking platform,
Norman Thomas gives the impres
sion of being anything but the lay
man's idea of a Socialist.
There are no bombs in his hip
packet, no red flags in his hands, no
incoherent babble from his lips. Be
cause he fights for the • masses,
rather than the classes, does not pre
vent him from being a cultured gen
tleman, a man of the world, a sauve
conversationalist.
Six Speeches
His speech here yesterday was the
fourth for the day, he admitted as
he rode around the campus after
leaving the Assembly Hall. Two
more speeches followed a few hours
later in San Francisco.
Passing Hoover's mansion, the So
cialist candidate for president re
marked, "Not bad. It's better look
ing than the White House."
Thus reminded of politics, long
legged, patriarchial Thomas said in
his resonant voice that Roosevelt
has shown more wisdom and cour
age than could be expected after
his record as governor. "He has
done everything possible for a Dem
ocrat to do. The trouble is not in
what Roosevelt has done, but in
what he has not done.
New Deal Drifts
"The New Deal is simply state
capitalism, and it will inevitably
drift toward Fascism. The good
points in the Roosevelt program are
really Socialism; these will help the
workers."
The leader of the Socialists of
American scoffed at the idea of a
war with Japan. "Japan has her
hands full with Russia and with
Great Britain's trade war."
