# Model Dairy Housed In Ruins of Old Distillery
## 
### BY FRANCES AYRES 
Long before Stanford had a Cel
lar, it boasted Winery on its cam
pus. Half a mile west of the Mau
soleum, a brick building, now
housing the model dairy of one R.
W. Krobbitzch, is the structure that
was the distilling place of Stanford's
once verdant grape.
The? Winery, built by Senator
Stanford to take care of the prod
ucts of his vineyard, which used to
lii in back of the Cactus Gardens,
w.is erected in lHh'K it closed its ca
red as such when il was partially

wrecked in the 1906 earthquake.
After that'the Winery wtiS deso
late, with rafters falling in and
empty casks standing in dusty,
lonely corners. In 1909 a generous
Board of Trustees decided to re
model the barrack-like structure for
a new dormitory for men. However,
no results of this plan were forth
coining, and "Winery Hall" never
came into being.
The historic and colorful land
mark was deserted under wild
. I raw berry vines until it was chosen
as a silt- for a dairy over a year ago.
