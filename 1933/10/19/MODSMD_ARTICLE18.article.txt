Headed by Student Body Presi
dent Jerry Trautrnun, a group of
Ruum-minded students yesterday
issued a proposal for the formation
of a model congress, with the added
request that all graduates and un
dergraduates interested meet with
l-he signers tonight, October 19, in
trie Little Theatre at 7:15 o'clock to
thrash out organization problems.
A Proposal for a Public Forum or
Model Congress:
- The undersigned students hereby
Simmon to meet with them tonight
in the Little Theatre at 7:15 o'clock,
any and all members of the Stan
ford student body, graduate or un
dergraduate, to discuss the forma
tion of a debating society.
They are moved to do this by the
consideration that at present there
is no means by which student opin
ion may become vocal; by the desire
to participate in the public ques
tions; and by the expectation of
profit from the practice and habit
of free and easy public speech.
All Are Welcome
It is proposed to establish the
rough outline of a society, to which
all Stanford men and women, un
dergraduate and graduate, can be
long. Such a society can conduct
its debate according to regular par
liamentary procedure. Subjects of
debate and the first two or four
speakers will be chosen in advance,
after which the discussion can be
resumed from the floor. Undoubt
edly distinguished outsiders will also
b-3 willing to participate in debates.
All interested in current affairs
should attend.
