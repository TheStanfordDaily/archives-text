"We tell the boys that the only i
way they have a chance of winning '
is to throw away their guns and j
knives and just sit," a leader of the !
cotton strikers told Daily reporters, j
And he meant what he said. Later |
during the course of a speech the I
same man told his listeners to thi'ow j
away their knives and forget about |
their guns. They are too well coun- j
seled to resort to violence.
Some of the leaders of the strike j
are loaded into trucks which travel \
up and down the counties. When !
they see men working in the fields j
they call to them and attempt to
induce them to stop work. If they j
get a negative response, they con- \
tinue on their way. Their picket !
lines are so well managed that even j
local authorities can find nothing to I
which they can object.
False reports have it that two j
truck loads of strike agitators left
Sail Jose for the strike area. With
the full force of the local and state
police looking for them so far, they j
have not been found.
Union leaders realize that as long |
as they can keep their men disci- J
. plined, they will succeed. So far
i their non-violence campaign has
been very effective. The source of
their money and their wise counsel
remain a mystery.
Arbitration at Stake
The strike gives an excellent op
portunity to study the methods of I
government "arbitration." The fed- I
i eral government represented by '
1 Fitzgerald, is attempting to force a '
settlement of the strike. Last Sat- i
urday he announced to the press j
ihal the strike was ended; that pick- ;
( ers would be in the fields Monday
! morning. Monday morning the num
ber of pickers could be counted on
two hands.
Failing to induce the strikers to
pick at the old price of 60 cents a
hundred pounds until the fact find
ing committee decided whether they j
| should be paid more, the "concilia- !
tor" attempted to intimidate them.
The local sheriff is reported to
have told strike leaders that if the
I pickers x-efused to obey the federal l
1 order to return to work, they would j
be defying the federal government, j
a much more serious matter than
disobeying the local authorities.
McDonald Speaks
McDonald, State Labor Commis
sioner, adopts an entirely different
attitude. He is in no hurry to get
ouf of the rural town of Tulare if
by remaining he can see that the
government fulfills its duty—that of
i.cting as an arbitrator between two
conflicting group interests and see
ing that both are given a fair hear
ing. • j
He even is radical enough to ad
mit that the pi-esent wage is not a
living wage, that the ignorant pick
ers have little chance to adequately
present their case when confronted
by the hired economists of the
growers. He realizes that the strik
ers want work, not charity, that in
timidation will not solve the diffi
culty, that some formula acceptable
to both groups can be found.
Scent of Strike
Strike headquarters in Pixley,
scene of the recent massacre, con
sists of an old hall on the outskirts
of the town. A bullet-drilled front
window pain, bits of lead embedded
in the studs, and two battle-torn
American flags are grim reminders
oi the first attempt of growers to
get their crop picked.
A quiet secretary of the Union
local .showed us the mimeograph
declarations issued to all strikers
urging them to hold out until their
demands are met, until Pat Cham
bers, their leader, is released from
jail to present their case to the fact
finding commission, until strikers
are free to picket the cotton fields
unmolested by armband special
deputies.
Situation Crucial
Meanwhile, another baby dies
fiom malnutrition. The mother re
fusing to sign a pledge to return to
the fields at her old wage-is not
allowed tu obtain milk for her child.
Growers have attempted to halt
local merchants in their food re
lief program, threatening to boycott
. their stores if they continue to send
supplies to the strike camps.
Drafted NRA Counciliator Creel
assures both parties they will be
given a fair deal. Workers remain
quiet while local authorities claim
iho back of the strike has been
; broken. A solution appears far
from realization.
Gum chewing has the effect of in
| creasing "peppiness" about 8 per
i cent, according to a psychology pro
i fes?or at Colgate.

"We tell the boys that the only i
way they have a chance of winning '
is to throw away their guns and j
knives and just sit," a leader of the !
cotton strikers told Daily reporters, j
And he meant what he said. Later |
during the course of a speech the I
same man told his listeners to thi'ow j
away their knives and forget about |
their guns. They are too well coun- j
seled to resort to violence.
Some of the leaders of the strike j
are loaded into trucks which travel \
up and down the counties. When !
they see men working in the fields j
they call to them and attempt to
induce them to stop work. If they j
get a negative response, they con- \
tinue on their way. Their picket !
lines are so well managed that even j
local authorities can find nothing to I
which they can object.
False reports have it that two j
truck loads of strike agitators left
Sail Jose for the strike area. With
the full force of the local and state
police looking for them so far, they j
have not been found.
Union leaders realize that as long |
as they can keep their men disci- J
. plined, they will succeed. So far
i their non-violence campaign has
been very effective. The source of
their money and their wise counsel
remain a mystery.
Arbitration at Stake
The strike gives an excellent op
portunity to study the methods of I
government "arbitration." The fed- I
i eral government represented by '
1 Fitzgerald, is attempting to force a '
settlement of the strike. Last Sat- i
urday he announced to the press j
ihal the strike was ended; that pick- ;
( ers would be in the fields Monday
! morning. Monday morning the num
ber of pickers could be counted on
two hands.
Failing to induce the strikers to
pick at the old price of 60 cents a
hundred pounds until the fact find
ing committee decided whether they j
| should be paid more, the "concilia- !
tor" attempted to intimidate them.
The local sheriff is reported to
have told strike leaders that if the
I pickers x-efused to obey the federal l
1 order to return to work, they would j
be defying the federal government, j
a much more serious matter than
disobeying the local authorities.
McDonald Speaks
McDonald, State Labor Commis
sioner, adopts an entirely different
attitude. He is in no hurry to get
ouf of the rural town of Tulare if
by remaining he can see that the
government fulfills its duty—that of
i.cting as an arbitrator between two
conflicting group interests and see
ing that both are given a fair hear
ing. • j
He even is radical enough to ad
mit that the pi-esent wage is not a
living wage, that the ignorant pick
ers have little chance to adequately
present their case when confronted
by the hired economists of the
growers. He realizes that the strik
ers want work, not charity, that in
timidation will not solve the diffi
culty, that some formula acceptable
to both groups can be found.
Scent of Strike
Strike headquarters in Pixley,
scene of the recent massacre, con
sists of an old hall on the outskirts
of the town. A bullet-drilled front
window pain, bits of lead embedded
in the studs, and two battle-torn
American flags are grim reminders
oi the first attempt of growers to
get their crop picked.

Editor's Note: This is the second
article on ilie strikes by keen, kurt

"We tell the boys that the only i
way they have a chance of winning '
is to throw away their guns and j
knives and just sit," a leader of the !
cotton strikers told Daily reporters, j
And he meant what he said. Later |
during the course of a speech the I
same man told his listeners to thi'ow j
away their knives and forget about |
their guns. They are too well coun- j
seled to resort to violence.
Some of the leaders of the strike j
are loaded into trucks which travel \
up and down the counties. When !
they see men working in the fields j
they call to them and attempt to
induce them to stop work. If they j
get a negative response, they con- \
tinue on their way. Their picket !
lines are so well managed that even j
local authorities can find nothing to I
which they can object.
False reports have it that two j
truck loads of strike agitators left
Sail Jose for the strike area. With
the full force of the local and state
police looking for them so far, they j
have not been found.
Union leaders realize that as long |
as they can keep their men disci- J
. plined, they will succeed. So far
i their non-violence campaign has
been very effective. The source of
their money and their wise counsel
remain a mystery.
Arbitration at Stake
The strike gives an excellent op
portunity to study the methods of I
government "arbitration." The fed- I
i eral government represented by '
1 Fitzgerald, is attempting to force a '
settlement of the strike. Last Sat- i
urday he announced to the press j
ihal the strike was ended; that pick- ;
( ers would be in the fields Monday
! morning. Monday morning the num
ber of pickers could be counted on
two hands.
Failing to induce the strikers to
pick at the old price of 60 cents a
hundred pounds until the fact find
ing committee decided whether they j
| should be paid more, the "concilia- !
tor" attempted to intimidate them.
The local sheriff is reported to
have told strike leaders that if the
I pickers x-efused to obey the federal l
1 order to return to work, they would j
be defying the federal government, j
a much more serious matter than
disobeying the local authorities.
McDonald Speaks
McDonald, State Labor Commis
sioner, adopts an entirely different
attitude. He is in no hurry to get
ouf of the rural town of Tulare if
by remaining he can see that the
government fulfills its duty—that of
i.cting as an arbitrator between two
conflicting group interests and see
ing that both are given a fair hear
ing. • j
