# 'Arms and the Man' Has Newcomers, Old Guard
## 
### BY ELIZABETH CHAPIN 
In his cast for "Arms and ihe
| Man," Harold Helvenston has set a
new high, both in quality and quan-
I tity of experienced Helvenstonians,
and in the selection of skilled new
j comers for the Shavian roles.
Mary Anita Loos?, late of Holly
j wood and the cinema, heads the
cast as the histrionic Raitia. Miss
Loos, in her two years here, has
! been seen as the snooty Julia Seton
j in "Holiday," A Ida in "Death Takes
| a Holiday," and the comic Louise
| Ilollister in "Hawk Island, plus
j Gaieties and Junior Opera assign
ments.
The bibulous Ned Seton of "Holi
day," the murdered man of "Hawk
| Island," Johnnie Peckham here has
his best role to date, thai of the
I romantic, boudoir-invading ehoco

kite soldier. Captain Bluntschli.
Variety has been the keynote of
Paul Ovary's career, which has been
highlighted by villainy in "Hawk
Island," journalism in "An Enemy
of the People," and now rugged
militarism.
In Jean Albertson and Virginia
Marvin, Helvenston has two of his
most promising debutantes in many
a moon. They play respectively the
maid and the mother of Raina. A
third novice is George Fuller, who
appears as the Prussian officer.
Another veteran is Waldo Salt,
v. }io is best remembered for his
comic butler in "Hawk Island," a
role not unlike his present Nikola,
the manservant.. George Leavens, of
thi casts of "Death Takes a Holi
day" and "The Mad Hopes," plays
the st iff-neckod Sergius.
