# INDIANS SPEND BUSY SESSION FOR DON TILT
## Tiny Stresses Passing And Blocking After Last Game's Result S.F.U. LOOKS FOR WIN Special Helmet Is Designed For Hamilton 
### Spud Hamilton 
"And .so far into the night it
went —"
Witli llu> lights of a couplc of
thousand or so candles beaming
down on them, Stanford's varsity
gridmen struggled and sweat and
sweat some more and then strug
gled again on the practice field
last night. Coach Thornhill, mani
festly dissatisfied with the trend
of things in the Northwestern
game, had promised all the way
home from Chicago that yester
day would see a long and hot
afternoon, and the hoys found his
words came home with a ven
l geance.
Passing practice developed into
tackling practice, which developed
into blocking practice. Then, the
fundamentals out of the way, a
I brisk signal practice began under
'the lights, and, to add the finishing
! touch, scrimmage got under way.
Thefe were no casualties.
No Injuries
The team escaped from the North
western appearance with no injuries
to speak of; "Monk" Moscrip has a
broken finger and the head man,
Thornhill, has an injured shoulder
and a pulled leg muscle. The team
| claims he hurt the leg rushing for
I the diner, while a little jolly horse
j play fixed up the shoulder.
Thornhill is frankly having tense
I moments over the outcome of Sat
urday's game with the San Fran-.
! ciSco Dons. Wi th ;ioraiftf< to win
and everything to lose, the Cardi
nals are going up against a hard
luck team, that by now must be
getting quite disgusted with losing,
and always by a close score.
At Soldier's Field, the line play
! was ragged, the blocking terrible.
| The Stanford line that looked so
! good against U.C.L.A. and Santa
Clara was always eutchurged by the
Wildcats.
O'Connor Looks Good
I Thornhill is happy over the show
!mg of left guard Bob O'Connor,
j who acquitted himself very well in
] Chicago. In fact., O'Connor may
j have looked, a little too good, for
Ihe distracted the newsmen from
i Bill Corbus, who was playing his
usual reliable game.
Thornhill will probably open
' against the Dons with tlic same
! line-up that started against
Northwestern. The medics have
finally got around with a dingus
1 for Bob Hamilton that looks like
\ a cross between a diver's helmet
! and a jack-o-lantern, but Hamil
ton will not play before the Wash
ington contest, if he plays then.

O'Connor Looks Good
I Thornhill is happy over the show
!mg of left guard Bob O'Connor,
j who acquitted himself very well in
] Chicago. In fact., O'Connor may
j have looked, a little too good, for
Ihe distracted the newsmen from
i Bill Corbus, who was playing his
usual reliable game.
Thornhill will probably open
' against the Dons with tlic same
! line-up that started against
Northwestern. The medics have
finally got around with a dingus
1 for Bob Hamilton that looks like
\ a cross between a diver's helmet
! and a jack-o-lantern, but Hamil
ton will not play before the Wash
ington contest, if he plays then.
"And .so far into the night it
went —"
Witli llu> lights of a couplc of
thousand or so candles beaming
down on them, Stanford's varsity
gridmen struggled and sweat and
sweat some more and then strug
gled again on the practice field
last night. Coach Thornhill, mani
festly dissatisfied with the trend
of things in the Northwestern
game, had promised all the way
home from Chicago that yester
day would see a long and hot
afternoon, and the hoys found his
words came home with a ven
l geance.
Passing practice developed into
tackling practice, which developed
into blocking practice. Then, the
fundamentals out of the way, a
I brisk signal practice began under
'the lights, and, to add the finishing
! touch, scrimmage got under way.
Thefe were no casualties.
No Injuries
The team escaped from the North
western appearance with no injuries
to speak of; "Monk" Moscrip has a
broken finger and the head man,
Thornhill, has an injured shoulder
and a pulled leg muscle. The team
| claims he hurt the leg rushing for
I the diner, while a little jolly horse
j play fixed up the shoulder.
Thornhill is frankly having tense
I moments over the outcome of Sat
urday's game with the San Fran-.
! ciSco Dons. Wi th ;ioraiftf< to win
and everything to lose, the Cardi
nals are going up against a hard
luck team, that by now must be
getting quite disgusted with losing,
and always by a close score.
At Soldier's Field, the line play
! was ragged, the blocking terrible.
| The Stanford line that looked so
! good against U.C.L.A. and Santa
Clara was always eutchurged by the
Wildcats.
