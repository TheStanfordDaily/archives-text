# The 						Dual World
## 
### 
Holding tlie same belief thai most people seem to, Nor
man Thomas placed great hope in this voting college gen
eration. He sees that they will learn what is right and then
lie hopes that they will act upon what is right. The gram
matical balance of the sentence should not blind us to the
lyirrible inconsistency of the thought it expresses.
It is true that at least some students learn facts and the
right facts (not necessarily Socialist facts) in classrooms.
Some (not many) even acquire the correct attitude of mind
towards problems. This attitude they display with great
avidity in their blue-books; for thev desire grades as they
desire nothing except a good (i.e. a swell) date for the next'
dance.
Hut once the professor ceases to drone, once the class
room is left, the student is back in the "practical" world of
Rotary, rum, and red scares. The-much heralded scientific!
method, he forgets as something for professors—not for
men of the world. And a man of what he thinks the world
is, he must be. lb' seeks not to improve upon the lacks lie
sees in positions of leadership, but to emulate the processes
that make them what they are today.
But all this is subconscious. In fact, it's unconscious.
The student sees two worlds or one and a half worlds.
One is college (that's the half); and the other is what lies
outside our %'J2,000 gates.
He knows that a boss is a nasty tiling; every political
science course tells him this. Hut a boss in his student
government can pass by unnoticed and when noticed, uii
damned. Let him try to gather facts (as the books say he
must), and people become alarmed, perplexed, and aston
ished.
A student can go to the biology lab and cut a rat up to
see what made him go around. Let him try to cut a campus
situation to see what makes il run around in circles till il
gets dizzy. Then the hollering begins.
