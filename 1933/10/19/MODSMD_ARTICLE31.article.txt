# Less Than Scraps of Paper

### 
Said a professor in ;i Daily interview yesterday that
one of the reasons that Germany will not fight was Hitler's
proclamations of peace, two in number. One hesitates lo '
hike issue with a keen expert like Dr. Lutz. History com
pels one to do so. however.
Since when have words ever stopped a war? Written
words don't. Before the World War, there was a signed
treaty declaring Belgium's neutrality. Germany violated
it; and records indicate that Britain and France would
have if German trains had not dumped armies into "nue- |
tnil" territory first.
There can be no more sacred effect to oral words than
to written, and written ones have with honesty been de- ,
clared "scraps of paper." When a nation decides on force,
nothing matters nothing non-physical deters it from ils
path.
Beccnt history in Germany, moreover, indicates clearly
I hat Hitler's path is militaristic though his words reek with
the odor of doves. Hitler's lieutenants, less suave, more
bombastic than the Chancellor, have solidified opposition
to Germany's re-arming. Their saber - rattling, powder
blasting has alarmed all.
Hitler realizes that saber-rattling without sabers is quite !
futile stirs Nazi blood, does little more. Bather would he
be peaceful, lill armed. Then he can rattle with more
effect. No nation bent on peace-would be so violent in its
attempts to re-arm, militarize its people, and make claims
that can only lead to war.
Kurope with reason watches fearfully Adolf Hitler.
