# BULL SESSION
## BOLD. BAD. BUMPTIOUS "BAWL OUT" 
### 
Today and tomorrow there is.sues
from the mechanical maws of the
j University Press, that dignified lit
tle scandal sheet, the Bawl Out. The
Bawl Out is here; like the noble
600," we accept it, unreasonably,
I unquestioningly.
i Until recently all the facts of life
were thus: sex, religion, the board
of aldermen. These things, were
things apart. To question "Why,"
was obviously ridiculous. To query
: "How Come," was the rankest of
heresy.
i
Few things at Stanford are or
dered that way. The Great God
Brown sandstone Bookstore has
tumbled into the hands of the criti
cal press; even the administration is
touchable. But the Bawl Out re
mains impervious. It is; seemingly
always has been: perhaps shall ever
remain so.
Officially, Bawl Out is a "Direc
tory of Officers and Students";
practically, it is the campus gossip
monger par excellence, exceeding in
that function even the Daily. That
Aimee Spiff lives at Elm Cottage j
may be of interest to some; it, is |
certainly no one's business except
Miss Spiff's that she went "plus" or
"minus," "pro'ed," or flunked. The
village gossip is no Farm demi-god;
last quarter's sudden burial of the
"Dirt" column indicated justified
repugnance to Winchellean mud
clinging on a university campus.

The buff-colored Bawl Out, seem
ingly so harmless, mocks the mod
ern educational structure, places the
bottom rail on top. It is well for
educators to beckon student moths
away from the meaningless glitter of
grades, to encourage obeisance to
the more meaningful torch of learn
ing. But when that which glitters
: gives all the glory (though not the
power), students-to-be cannot be
expected to stand all the gaff with
out some of ihe guff. Psychologists
have discarded the theory that
greater obstacles make for greater
success.
That bumptious Bawl Out is still
more insidious. In the eagle eyes of
professor and reader, Bawl Out av
! erages loom large. The minus stu
dent, not a hot-house curiosity on
. the campus, approaches his apple
polishing prospect with the greatest
temerity. His is a sense of futility.
His cards are already on the table;
every finesse falls flat, every ace is
trumped. He is more than vulnei -
able, is too often doubled and set.
The University tells us we are here
ior an education; bold Bawl Out
! ings of the greater glory of grades.
Better judgment tells us we are at
Stanford to learn; bad Bawl Out
chortles: '"You're out for grades."
A Bawl Out is undoubtedly an in
centive. But it is an incentive in
ihe wrong direction!

heresy.
i
Few things at Stanford are or
dered that way. The Great God
Brown sandstone Bookstore has
tumbled into the hands of the criti
cal press; even the administration is
touchable. But the Bawl Out re
mains impervious. It is; seemingly
always has been: perhaps shall ever
remain so.
Officially, Bawl Out is a "Direc
tory of Officers and Students";
practically, it is the campus gossip
monger par excellence, exceeding in
that function even the Daily. That
Aimee Spiff lives at Elm Cottage j
may be of interest to some; it, is |
certainly no one's business except
Miss Spiff's that she went "plus" or
"minus," "pro'ed," or flunked. The
village gossip is no Farm demi-god;
last quarter's sudden burial of the
"Dirt" column indicated justified
repugnance to Winchellean mud
clinging on a university campus.

The buff-colored Bawl Out, seem
ingly so harmless, mocks the mod
ern educational structure, places the
bottom rail on top. It is well for
educators to beckon student moths
away from the meaningless glitter of
grades, to encourage obeisance to
the more meaningful torch of learn
ing. But when that which glitters
: gives all the glory (though not the
power), students-to-be cannot be
expected to stand all the gaff with
out some of ihe guff. Psychologists
have discarded the theory that
greater obstacles make for greater
success.
That bumptious Bawl Out is still
more insidious. In the eagle eyes of
professor and reader, Bawl Out av
! erages loom large. The minus stu
dent, not a hot-house curiosity on
. the campus, approaches his apple
polishing prospect with the greatest
temerity. His is a sense of futility.
His cards are already on the table;
every finesse falls flat, every ace is
trumped. He is more than vulnei -
able, is too often doubled and set.
The University tells us we are here
ior an education; bold Bawl Out
! ings of the greater glory of grades.
Better judgment tells us we are at
Stanford to learn; bad Bawl Out
chortles: '"You're out for grades."
A Bawl Out is undoubtedly an in
centive. But it is an incentive in
ihe wrong direction!
