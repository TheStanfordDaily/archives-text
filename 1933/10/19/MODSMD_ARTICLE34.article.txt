THE CRITICAL CLICHE:
Speech and the Actor
There is a sort of critic who re
marks in praise of an actor that he
spoke clearly, that his enunciation
| was perfect, that his speech was at
all times intelligible.
This seems either an evasion of a
deeper criticism or a rather sad mis
! conception of the actor's duty. And
! yet, particularly during a Shake
spearean season, the same phrases
i appear innumerable times.
| In the first place, intelligibility is,
or should be, taken for granted. If
an actor is to portray a character
other ihan by pantomine and grants
| —which is, that God, an uncom
! mon curiosity—he must necessarily
J speak with sufficient clarity that his
j audience may be able to understand
1 not only what he is saying, but
i what his viewpoint is in relation to
that of other characters. This is,
j obviously, one of the simplest and

most basic demands upon any actor. \
In the second place, clear speech j
alone is by no means a sufficient J
attribute. The recent appearance of 1
Walter Hampden proved that. For \
Hampden, although possessing a ,
magnificent voice, and utilizing it :
with the traditional clarity of the j
bell, never varies it. In short, he i
seldom acts.
His Caponsacchi is not a romantic I
young blade in the cape of a gal- '
lant, but a preacher in a highly un
suitable garb. He reads his lines
sonorously but unmovingly and fre- ;
quently reads blank verse not as i
living speech but. as rhythmic series j
of lambic pentameters.
Many critics nave fallen at one :
time or other into this shallow j
method of praising players. Either i
an a misconception of the actor's i
essential duties if he is to be called 1
an actor at all, or as an admission j
of incompetence at. a deeper under- j
standing of the player's interprets- !
tion, it is a lamentable and foolish j
practice — one to be sedulously!
