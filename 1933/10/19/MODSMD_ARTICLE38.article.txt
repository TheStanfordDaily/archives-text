To the Editor of the Daily:
I wish to suggest that it is both |
fitting and right to declare a uni- I
versity assembly with classes ex- j
cused when a man of the calibre of j
Norman Thomas speaks. The op- :
portunity of hearing the fine speak
ers coming to Stanford should be j
extended to all students instead of j
just tho.se who happen to be free at ]
that time.
Marshall Johnstone, '36.
