## INDIANS HOME, NOT DOWNHEARTED 
### 
Stanford's varsity men are back
from ihe big city and they are not
ci all downhearted concerning their
gume with Northwestern. "Why
.should we be?" asked one. "North
western had a big fast line that con
sistently outcharged our own, tneir
fullback, Duvall, had a drive that
was always good for a couple of
yards at center. The accounts of the
l.ame didn't do justice to Olson. He
was every inch an All-American in
that game."
Statistics on Olson's kicking are
deceiving. Forced to kick time after
time into a terrific wind, his punts
would land well up Ihe field and
then be blown back toward their
si Jil ting point.
"Two years ago, Olson made Pug
Rentner," declared another player.
"Boy, he's plenty good."
