# STANFORD ENDS. MORE-SCRIPT AND NO-GOOD
## 
### 
It seems that ihe game was, as
football games go, pretty roug'h and
oui man Moscrip was in there giv
ing and taking with the best of them.
He got tapped several times on the
windpipe and went to complain to
the referee, but all he could do was
stutter.
The Northwestern men ribbed the
Stanford ends plenty, and kept call
ing Moscrip, "More-script," while
they dubbed Norgard, "No-good."
