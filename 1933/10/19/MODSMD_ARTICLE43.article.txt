# NO FOOTBALL STORIES WORTH A PLUGGED SLUG
## 
### 
Indeed, I do not believe there has
over been a football story that will
survive as a work of art. There is
no reason for this; boxing, and horse
racing have been responsible for ex
cellent literature. There comes to
mind a fine little yarn about a col
ored jockey, written by Donn Byrne.
It appeared in Grantland Rice's
"Anthropology of Sport," but the
names escapes me. Ernest Heming
way has been particularly successful
at sport stories, notably "The Unde
feated.which concerns bull-fight
ing, and "Fifty Grand," a yarn about
a box-fighter.
But no one ever gets out a good
football story. For example, there's
this thing called "Saturday's Mil
lions," written obviously with an
eye on the cinema box office. It
was turned out by Lucian Cary, who
ha;- never done anything above the
2.225,000 weekly circulation class
anyway. With Ernie Nevers and
Ernie Pinckert in the cast we hope
it made a good movie. As a story
the best thing about it was the
title. â€”Hamilton
