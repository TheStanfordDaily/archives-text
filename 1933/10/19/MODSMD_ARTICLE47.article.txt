# 35 Frosh Sign Up for Track
## 
### 
More than 35 potential Cardinal
frosh trackmen signed for their re
spective events at an organization
meeting of the group held in the
B.A.C. Building. Two sprinters from
Colorado, Charles Voigt and Fred
Williams, both football players,
bring good reputations with them.
Rusty March, a 1:58 half-miler from
Seattle, may be shifted to the mile.
With the exception of March, the
middle distances are sure of prom
ise, quarter-milers being needed es
pecially. The hurdles have a fair
representation, as has the broad
jump. With a 47-foot shot-putter,
a 134-foot discus man. and a 189-
foot javelin tosser, the Stanford
weight prowess gives evidence of
being perpetuated at least through
1837.
The pole-vault and high jump are
considered weak, unless the few
men who have signed improve con
siderably above their best marks to
date.
"Young people are taking life
more seriously lately. The jazz age
is passing v/ilh the depression."â€”
