Out of the haze surrounding head
quarters of the Daily Board of
Sirategy are drifting reports of fair
haired youths coming West to bol
ster my 1933 world-beating Black
and Blue grid machine that will
clash with Chappie athletes in the
Big Game classic.
Far East, Far North, and Far
South, scouts have been bombard
ing the Strategy Board with reports
of young aspix-ants to the game of
feet ball who, if claims are trust
worthy, are willing to sign contracts
and play for God, Country, and
Daily. They are accredited passers,
runners, and demons on defense.
Only surpassing the amount of
leports is the amount of donations
filling Daily coffers. As the tide of
gold rises, so rise Daily member
hopes for a triumph.
Considerably heartened by the
reports of far-away scouts, mem
bers of the Daily football machine
are concentrating their efforts to
buy ace-high athletes of the Fleish
hacker and allied zoos. Several op
tions are held by Daily moguls on
principal footballers on the Coast
but the order "Bring 'em Back
Alive" .still holds for outpost scouts.
