# FINE TENNIS PLAY SHOWN By FROSH
## 
### 
Before an incredulous throng of
campus tennis players two of Stan
ford's newest racket men almost
created havoc with established law
and order yesterday afternoon.
Playing a friendly match of dou
i bles, Keith Gledhill, Stanford Davis
| Cup player and his partner, Joe
Coughlin, co-holders of last year's
intercollegiate doubles, took the
! courts against Freshmen Ben Dey
and Billy Seward.
However, no one was rÂ£ady for
what later occurred. At first, Gled
hill and Coughlin playing with a
smooth finish swept through a first
set by easy score of 6-2. They were
j obviously masters of the other two
I players.
In the second set, Dey exhibiting
! a powerful service and Seward a
backhand stroke which is undoubt
edly the best ever to be seen on a
Stanford varsity court by any frosh,
I quickly took advantage of these two
in running up a 4-1 lead.
With Gledhill serving, the two
' Babe net men broke through to win
a love game. Quite an unusual hap
pening on Giedhill's very severe
service. Again Dey and Seward won
j their service to take the second set
(6-1.
Playing fine tennis both sides
made excellent volleys, and the
j score evened up until seven all. Fi
-1 nally the old veterans Gledhill and
I Coughlin broke through to win 7-5),
but incidentally offered fine proof
that the Cardinal yearling netmen
j will not fear for want of talent.
