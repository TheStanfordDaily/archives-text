# SOCCER MEN FACE SAN JOSE TEAM WITH CHANGES IN STARTING LINE-UP
## 
### 
Strengthened by line-up rear
rangements, the work of Soccer
Coach Harry Maloney, Stanford's
viasity will attack its second con
feu nee adversary Saturday. The
San Jose soccer team is scheduled
to be the first victim of the reno
vated Indian squad led by Captain
Carl Knecht, all-conference forward
for 1932.
Defeated 2 to 0 by the San Jose
soccermen in a practice contest
after three days of scrimmage, the
old line-up suffered another 2 to 0
let-down from S.F.U. last Saturday.
Nov well pleased with this, Maloney
completely altered the team, re
-1 adding his entire varsity up
through the middle, excepting Jack
King, veteran goalie.

Johnnie Moore, most experienced
soccerman, was shifted from center
half to center forward. Replaced
by Moore in the forward wall, Cy
Jehnson displaced Rod Lewis at
fullback and has since been co
operating whh Dick Strouse in such
a manner as to produce a promising
ciiifn.se. Filling Moore's berth, va
cated in the renovation, Waddy
White appeared somewhat settled at
last. However, this will probably
be changed when Doug Kennedy
again becomes eligible and takes
this berth, his old varsity position.
