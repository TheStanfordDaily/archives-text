Editor's Note: To the Thomas lec
ture went the regular Daily reporter,
llis story appears 011 Page 1, col. 2.
Also went a non-Dahyman. His
story follows: different, stimulating.

It can hardly be known whether
Citizen Norman Thomas remem
; bered at 4:20 yesterday afternoon
! that the founder of Stanford Uni
versity was what some call a
"bloated capitalist." Certainly it was
with aristocratic self-possession that
; he bowed to the curt introduction of
\ President R. L. Wilbur (late Secre-
I tar> of the Interior, and probably a
| capitalist, although hardly a bloated
! one), and pushed virilely forth into
| an hour of staccato comments on his
I announced topic of "Today and To
morrow."
j Youth came to hear Thomas, in
j numbers that stuffed the Assembly
; Hall, and it was to youth he spoke.
1 Any who had hoped for the verbal
! equivalent of red-flag-waving, how
! ever, were disappointed. Throughout
! much of his speech, the late Soeial
: ist candidate confined himself to
j remarks that might well have come
from an enlightened conservative,
j though probably not with the same
force and gusto. Rapidly he sketched
the sorry status quo of the world,
J condemned the forces of national
i ism that now tower stronger than
j before the World War, stated em
i piratically that a nation divided
against itself in political and eco
j nomic system will fall, and con
cluded with a cry for social organi
zation by the rising generation that
| may yÂ°l come i'n time to avert civi
-1 lization's doom.
1 It was almost incidentally, though
not by way of mere entertainment,
1 that he alluded to certain individ
-1 uals like' Morgan and Mitchell, and
! to certain institutions like the Na
tional City Bank and (euphemisti
cally) the Interstate Commerce
Commission. Our hope for tomor
row, he indicated, lies in the
utilization of intelligence.
Wilbur sat through most of the
speech with the outward mien of a
male sphynx. He blinked his eyes
now and then, and on one occasion
was seen to move his left arm.
Thomas held his crowd well,
speaking in a slightly hoarse though
exceedingly clear voice. His manner
was faintly tinged with cynicism,
understandable in one who has
spent some years speaking earnestly
into wooden ears, and in language
Ihe proved himself master both of
refined phrase and forceful collo
quialism. His total personality, in
truth, resembled that of a nearly
dead genus: the two-fisted college
| professor.
Noble Kizer and Rip Miller, Navy
| and Purdue football coaches, re
spectively, were buddies in the
Notre Dame line in '24 and became
brothers-in-law, marrying sisters
, from Elkart, Ind., near Notre Dame.
