Interest booming in Gertrude
Boyle Kanno's sculpture portraits
and figure sketches, the Stanford

the noted San Francisco artist's
work.
Bronze figurines, life studies in
pencil, and sculpture portraits of
many national but largely Califor

expansive collection on Kanno's

created work equal to that of Bo
