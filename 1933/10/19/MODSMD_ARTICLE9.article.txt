# THOMAS MAKES PLEA FOR NEW PEACE OUTLOOK
## Socialist Leader Cheered By Large Assembly Hall Audience ANALYZES SITUATION Economic Structure False, Declares Speaker 
### Albert Guerard, Jr 
"There will be no peace until our !
rampant nationalism is forgotten, j
and our essential international loy- '
allies are recognized." These words, ;
spoken with the thundering elo- {
quence of a man in dead earnest,
furnished the frame for Socialist
Leader Norman Thomas' lecture
yesterday afternoon on "Today and
Tomorrow: A Review of Present So
cial Forces."
Emphasizing that the present j
world structure is one of economic :
interdependance, keen, flashing- !
eyed Thomas appealed to the pres- j
c-rn college generation to recognize j
this fundamental fact, to destroy the j
existing misconceptions. "We are i
limited politically to national loy- j
alty; we have not even reached this
stage in economic life," he declared. :
Political Evils Scoffed
Thomas scoffed at the professed
seriousness of political evils. "After
years of fighting Tammany, I have j
decided that it never cost New York
as much as did Wail Street. Jimmie
Walker never was as expensive as
advisor as Charles Mitchell." Keen
witted, smiling Thomas added: "And
Walker gave us mucli more enter- 1
tainment!"
Stanford students and faculty
filled the Assembly Hall to the last
balcony row: cheered editor, lec
turer Thomas warmly when he first
walked onto the Assembly Hall ros
tvum. His gentle, intelligent face,
high forehead topped by silver hair, :
and dignity of expression reminded
trtt large audience of the late John '
Galsworthy. Thomas spoke with a
slight Scotch "burr." Beside him,
only slightly taller, only slightly j
thinner, was President Ray Ly-1
man Wilbur, who sat inscrutably
throughout the lecture, as is his
custom, not wincing when Thomas
discussed education, the Reconstruc
tion Finance Corporation.
"War a Possibility"
Concerning "tomorrow": "There
are three possibilities:- war and ca
tastrophe, fascism (which ultima
tely' would mean disaster), and the
mastery of machinery by social
ownership. We cannot go on as we
are now doing. We are a nation
divided. In politics we are demo
cratic; in economics, autocratic."
Student-readers of American jour
nalism applauded when internation
alist Thomas said that one of the
three things which might evade an
other war is the American convic
tion that "we were well stung in
the last war." The other two factors
are Europe's war-weariness, and the
fact that Hitler's Germany lacks
armed strength.
Thomas' principal message that
the youth of today must conquer
the spirit of nationalism and pa
triotism which now prevails
throughout the world, if a better
synthesis is to be acquired,
driven home with a burst of ex
ceptional oratory.
Eloquent, ex-clergyman Thomas
had evidently not forgotten his col
lege days at Princeton and Union
Theological Seminary, where he
probably was told the familiar
Presbyterian formula: "Pound the
table, pound the table! Wood* is
cheap and souls are precious." The
Assembly Hall speaker's desk en
dured a 'warm 50 minutes.
In conclusion Thomas said: "No
man of my generation can hand out
he blue prints to you. You must
not subscribe to the American dis
ease of 'meetingitis.' Add to your
philosophy a plan and a program!"

nalism applauded when internation
alist Thomas said that one of the
three things which might evade an
other war is the American convic
tion that "we were well stung in
the last war." The other two factors
are Europe's war-weariness, and the
fact that Hitler's Germany lacks
armed strength.
Thomas' principal message that
the youth of today must conquer
the spirit of nationalism and pa
triotism which now prevails
throughout the world, if a better
synthesis is to be acquired,
driven home with a burst of ex
ceptional oratory.
Eloquent, ex-clergyman Thomas
had evidently not forgotten his col
lege days at Princeton and Union
Theological Seminary, where he
probably was told the familiar
Presbyterian formula: "Pound the
table, pound the table! Wood* is
cheap and souls are precious." The
Assembly Hall speaker's desk en
dured a 'warm 50 minutes.
In conclusion Thomas said: "No
man of my generation can hand out
he blue prints to you. You must
not subscribe to the American dis
ease of 'meetingitis.' Add to your
philosophy a plan and a program!"
"There will be no peace until our !
rampant nationalism is forgotten, j
and our essential international loy- '
allies are recognized." These words, ;
spoken with the thundering elo- {
quence of a man in dead earnest,
furnished the frame for Socialist
Leader Norman Thomas' lecture
yesterday afternoon on "Today and
Tomorrow: A Review of Present So
cial Forces."
Emphasizing that the present j
world structure is one of economic :
interdependance, keen, flashing- !
eyed Thomas appealed to the pres- j
c-rn college generation to recognize j
this fundamental fact, to destroy the j
existing misconceptions. "We are i
limited politically to national loy- j
alty; we have not even reached this
stage in economic life," he declared. :
Political Evils Scoffed
Thomas scoffed at the professed
seriousness of political evils. "After
years of fighting Tammany, I have j
decided that it never cost New York
as much as did Wail Street. Jimmie
Walker never was as expensive as
advisor as Charles Mitchell." Keen
witted, smiling Thomas added: "And
Walker gave us mucli more enter- 1
tainment!"
Stanford students and faculty
filled the Assembly Hall to the last
balcony row: cheered editor, lec
turer Thomas warmly when he first
walked onto the Assembly Hall ros
tvum. His gentle, intelligent face,
high forehead topped by silver hair, :
and dignity of expression reminded
trtt large audience of the late John '
Galsworthy. Thomas spoke with a
slight Scotch "burr." Beside him,
only slightly taller, only slightly j
thinner, was President Ray Ly-1
man Wilbur, who sat inscrutably
throughout the lecture, as is his
custom, not wincing when Thomas
discussed education, the Reconstruc
tion Finance Corporation.
"War a Possibility"
Concerning "tomorrow": "There
are three possibilities:- war and ca
tastrophe, fascism (which ultima
tely' would mean disaster), and the
mastery of machinery by social
ownership. We cannot go on as we
are now doing. We are a nation
divided. In politics we are demo
cratic; in economics, autocratic."
Student-readers of American jour
nalism applauded when internation
