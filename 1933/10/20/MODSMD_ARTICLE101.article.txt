# NEW STRIPES "IN"
## 
### 
After finding great success on
Eastern campuses, Partridge stripes
in sox and neckwear are coming
West. But while Partridge stripes
are considered "in," solid colors
have by no means gone out. Solid
colors in hose are especially good to
harmonize with flacks and cords
for campus and classroom wear.
