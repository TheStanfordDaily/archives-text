# Hats Foster Angelic Look
## Headgear of Netting Banded With Velvet New Idea 
### 
"Halo Hats" are what I. Magnin
calls them. '"Malines" they are
named in the White House, a term
vaguely reminiscent of a princess in
one of Grimm's fairy tales. What
ever their name, they do indeed
help foster that angelic, ethereal
look a girl so often needs when she
is dancing, of an evening, in her last
formal gown, or informal dinner
dress.
They are nothing more than pieces
of net or more substantial material
cleverly banded with velvet. They
set back on curled hair, and some of
them have tiny, mystifying veils. A j
dark plum color, for instance, on
bright blond hair is extremely deco
lative. And they do keep the hair,,
blond or brunette, modestly in place. ;
