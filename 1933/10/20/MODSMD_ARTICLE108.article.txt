To conceal or to reveal; —that is |
the question. Whether it. is better I
to modestly suffer from overdress i
or to join the Mae West school and i
get along with just a bare coverage.
The pro and con of this issue
which has Hollywood, Paris, and
fashion centers all agog was argued .
in an interview with Dorothy Wieck,
screen star, and Mae, herself, for j
the NEA news service.
Said Miss Wieck, who is all for i
concealment: "I believe that men, j
and women, too, are attracted by the j
unattainable. When women wore j
leg o' mutton sleeves and high- j
necked gowns in the Victorian era j
they had as many beaux as they j
have today. The personality of a !
woman is somehow affected by the j
clothes she v/ears. Give her a gown j
that is too decollate and she be
comes too self-conscious to play the
siren. Let her wear a gown that is
utterly simple, though chic, and she
becomes a siren in reality.
"Women lose a certain sense of
chic when they are conscious of their
clothes. When the part of the plain
fraulein was offered to me, in
"Maedchen in Uniform," I was hap- j
py that I was to wear a plain dress. I
There were no adornments to my j
clothes, no trinkets to play with.
"Yes, I'm for concealment. A ■
great deal of chic, perhaps, but a j
little concealment. It's an excellent
tonic for the imagination."
Says Mae West, star of "She Done ]
Him Wrong" and "I'm No Angel":
"I'm all for revealment. If a girl's !
got a swell figure, what's the use of
hiding it? I'm proud of my "figger," i
have worked for years developing I
it and now that I've arrived, I don't i
see why I should be selfish and keep j
it a secret, do you?

"A woman should look just as j
beautiful without any clothes, in my !
opinion, as when she is clad in the j
finest creations of Schiaparelli and
a!! those other hifalutin' Paris de- j
signers.
"Of course I'm not advocating
nudism or anything like that, you i
understand! I may be plenty hot, !
but I'm no Hottentot!
"There's never been a real woman j
who didn't love pretty clothes, I
adornments, and* fine feathers—and j
I'm proud to be considered just a [
real woman myself — but clothes!
should reveal the feminine form, |
rather than conceal it."

"A woman should look just as j
beautiful without any clothes, in my !
opinion, as when she is clad in the j
finest creations of Schiaparelli and
a!! those other hifalutin' Paris de- j
signers.
"Of course I'm not advocating
nudism or anything like that, you i
understand! I may be plenty hot, !
but I'm no Hottentot!
"There's never been a real woman j
who didn't love pretty clothes, I
adornments, and* fine feathers—and j
I'm proud to be considered just a [

should reveal the feminine form, |
rather than conceal it."
To conceal or to reveal; —that is |
the question. Whether it. is better I
to modestly suffer from overdress i
or to join the Mae West school and i
get along with just a bare coverage.
The pro and con of this issue
which has Hollywood, Paris, and
fashion centers all agog was argued .
in an interview with Dorothy Wieck,
screen star, and Mae, herself, for j
the NEA news service.
Said Miss Wieck, who is all for i
concealment: "I believe that men, j
and women, too, are attracted by the j
unattainable. When women wore j
leg o' mutton sleeves and high- j
necked gowns in the Victorian era j
they had as many beaux as they j
have today. The personality of a !
woman is somehow affected by the j
clothes she v/ears. Give her a gown j
that is too decollate and she be
comes too self-conscious to play the
siren. Let her wear a gown that is
utterly simple, though chic, and she
becomes a siren in reality.
"Women lose a certain sense of
chic when they are conscious of their
clothes. When the part of the plain
fraulein was offered to me, in
"Maedchen in Uniform," I was hap- j
py that I was to wear a plain dress. I
There were no adornments to my j
clothes, no trinkets to play with.
"Yes, I'm for concealment. A ■
great deal of chic, perhaps, but a j
little concealment. It's an excellent
tonic for the imagination."
Says Mae West, star of "She Done ]
Him Wrong" and "I'm No Angel":
"I'm all for revealment. If a girl's !
got a swell figure, what's the use of
hiding it? I'm proud of my "figger," i
have worked for years developing I
it and now that I've arrived, I don't i
see why I should be selfish and keep j
it a secret, do you?
