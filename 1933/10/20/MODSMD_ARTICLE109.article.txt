# MILADY'S SLIPPERS EXTREMELY SIMPLE FOR EVENING WEAR
## 
### 
When milady attends evening j
functions this fall she will be wear- j
ing shoes that are exceptionally j
simple if she is to remain in mode, j
All evening shoes are simple in both j
fashion and design.
The swanky stores are showing j
both pumps and sandals of faille
crepe and Ihe old standby satins. 1
Fabric slippers are trimmed in gold
and silver kid this autumn. Really
sophisticated women will not neg- j
lect their shoes when selecting their ]
ensemble for wear in the evenings.
They will be careful to choose the '
correct slipper type, the color and I
fabric.
If her gown is of dull crepe the j
well-dressed woman will select a
sandal of the same material, while if
she is wearing satin, slippers of that
cloth will round out the ensemble
correctly. Whether the slippers
match in color or contrast is left
entirely to the individual color â€¢
scheme.
Either the sandal or the pump is j
correct footwear. Most of the san
dals are fashioned with that flatter
ing finish up the front known as the j
"T" strap.
