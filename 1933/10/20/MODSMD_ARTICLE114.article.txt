# BOWS OUTSTANDING ON FASHION FRONT
## 
### 
It may be a good thing to keep
your beaus secret but not your
bows.
Neckwear is in the spotlight at
Livingston's where the discrimin
ating buyer can get the latest in
collars and bows. One of the strik
ing new models is a large square
collar of heavy white slipper satin.
This particular piece smacks of the
sailor influence that is running rani
pant.
Strips of appliqued satin give the
effect of braid on an elegant middy.
A smart little sailor hat is being rec
ommended with the white collar and
middy.
Bows are good because they can
be used on old or new costumes to
flatier the wearer. Large bows of
embroidered organdy, batiste, and
net are going like wildfire.
