# Longer Daytime Skirts Fashionable This Fall
## 
### 
Longer and narrower daytime
skirts will be in fashion this fall
with the hem being not more than
eight or nine inches from the floor.
Wide cut shoulders are still popular
though the over-bouffant sleeves
have made way for a modified form.
Rust, eel gray, and browns arc
the leading colors for sport* wear,
while rough or hand - knit - like
weaves are predominating in the
clothes used in sport
suits. Wool crepe, baby lamb an
gora, Harris tweed, and flannel are
also popular materials.
Knit wear will not be nearly so
fussy this season as last. It will be
in simple style with necklines mov
ing upward. New bright Chinese
colors are extremely popular in knit
wear dresses. Twin sweater combi
nations of the same or contrasting
colors will be seen a good deal and
will be popular for campus wear,
say Roos fashion experts.
