# Green, Russet Shades Shown For Fall Style
## Two-Piece Suit Displayed For Sport Wardrobe 
### 
Changing seasons mean changing
wardrobes. And f; 11 demands prob
ably the most radical change of the
year. Two-piece sport suits, useful
for their general wearability, will
jbe much worn. Colors are prefer
ably green and russet with perhaps
] a small amount of fur.
A clever all-around dress for
early fall is a mustard wool dotted
in black and a wide black belt—
and best of all, it buttons up with
little black wooden beer kegs. Seen
at Leibes' Campus corner.
Another favorite is made of soft
rust-colored wool, banded around
the shoulders and neckline with
i-leek brown beaver. Combine this
j with one of those brownish, beaver
ish felt hats, and you have the ultra
ult.ra for the Big Game.
Leather jackets are being pushed
into the background by more and
better twin-sweater sets, but long
suede swagger coats still hold their
own. Worumba polo coats are still
j with us and are oh, so comfortable.
Afternoon dresses express the
j trend of elegance rather than the
informality of last season. One
I lovely model has a hip-length blouse
of cloth of silver over a black
woolen skirt" A pansy blue silk
! scarf ties under the "hin.
Lame and sequins sparkle from
1 four o'clock on, and are receiving
honors with feather boas (a ia Mae
West) to accent the darker evening
gowns. Formals Will be of heavy
silks, moires, and satins in dark,
I subtle jewel tones —amethyst, topaz,
! and garnet.

This season the cautious co -ed 1
need not worry about getting the
tip of her nose'sun-buibed at those
wearing football games because
sport hats not have brims are man- |
nhh to,extent vf tuck in the top and
tiny feather for ornament.

Golden jewelry is the accessory
chosen by women who know how to
add that individualistic bright note
to their brownish tweed:; and more
somber garments. Some swanky
bracelets seen often are made of
large flat links.
