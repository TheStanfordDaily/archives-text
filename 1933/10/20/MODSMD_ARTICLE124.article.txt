# Stanford Rough Dying at Hands Of New Smoothy
## 
### 
Houghs may blame it on the new
women, the new women may swell
with pride at being accused of it,
but it was that 1!J32 draft of East
ern prep school men that really be
gan to make us all style conscious.
The spattered cord and the always
wet looking moleskin held on during
the fall and winter last year, but
when spring and the sun returned
there was nothing in the world that
would stop those boys from Kiski,
Lawrenceville, and Andover from
adopting better clothes.
The boys who killed the rough
may have to carry his bier, for the
better dressed Stanford man begins
to rival his Eastern brother in the
catching of feminine glances.
