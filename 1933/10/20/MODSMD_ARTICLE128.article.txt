# O'Coat Styles Show Variety
## Balmacaan, Wrap-Around, Guards Coat Offered 
### 
Three definitely new styles in top
coats have made their appearance
this year to make the male buyer
ponder a little before choosing.
Namely, the coats are the Balma
caan, the Wrap-Around and the
Guard's Coat.
Tho Guard's Coat was designed
lor formal evening wear but unlike
luost of its predecessors has soft
molded lines. The molded lines give
the coat an easy draped appearance
, that completes the formal ensemble
well. With a half belt in back th'e
coat is a symphony of softness.
Most popular coat this season will
no doubt be the Wrap-Around
which has already taken hold in
university centers. This garment
gets its name from the fact that it
has no buttons and. is held in place
bj a tied belt.. Cambridge gray,
blue and plaids will be the popular
colors for this coat.
Especially large pockc-is are an
other feature of this garment.
The Balmacaan model is also one
of the popular coats that college
men seem to be buying. Going to
the other extreme from the Wrap-
Around this coat has no belt at all
but is also cut in rough* woven fab
rics. To top the coat off, so to speak,
is a new Prussian collar of jaunty
cut.
