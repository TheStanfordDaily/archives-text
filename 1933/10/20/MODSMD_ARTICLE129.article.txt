# Gloves With Detachable Cuffs New Style Quirk
## 
### 
Now that gloves are being' worn
again and prosperity is just around
the corner, fashion experts have de- ,
signed a very practical glove that
has a leather hand and a whole se
ries of detachable cloth cuffs.
The leather part of the glove has j
a tab with buttons on it that fit
buttonholes on the cuff sections.
This makes it possible to add that
little touch of variety to your '
clothes. One day you can wear a j
black silk cuff with afternoon
clothes and the next change to plaid
wools. Or perhaps even red ones.
If you're clever with a needle you
can even make cuffs yourself to
match anything in the clothes j
closet.
