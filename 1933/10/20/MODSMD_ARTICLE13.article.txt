# HARVEST THEME FOR HICK DANCE
## Old Clothes and Cornstalks At Sequoia Tonight 
### 
Pumpkins, cornstalks, rustic at
mosphere, and high jinks await the
seekers after true romance who will 1
swarm this eve to Sequoia Hall,
whex - e A1 Rushton's popular melody
huskers will create melodious ac
companiment to the shuffle of Stan
ford feet at the Halloween dance.
The harvest time motif will be
effected through the industry of
Sequoia Dance Committee chairman
Dante Lembi, who promises to bring
tears to the eyes of the merrymak
ers with a long, shiny bar which
will not serve 3.2 but will serve 1
campus legal 3.2 substitute, pure,
ice-cold cider, very fresh.
Stanford roughs, at home in any
environment, will face a program j
made to order for them. Old clothes
and other .relics of the late depres
sion will be the most practical cos
time. With bobbing for apples,
spinning plates, and cavorting about
Sequoia meadows, the "Back to the
Farm" movement will smite the
campus with a vengeance.
Bids for the affair are practically
all sold. The few remaining tickets
may be obtained at the A.S.S.U. j
office for 75 cents.
