# SLACKS REPLACING CORDS, MOLESKINS
## 
### 
With (he disappearing Stanford
rough goes also the traditional cords
end moleskins that have been so
prevalent on the Quad for lo these
many years.
And as the new order replaces
the old, in come the slacks, tweeds,
flannels, and linens. This fall the
campus will see almost exclusively
the slack in varying design and ma
terial though for the most part in
either gray or brown tones.
At Phelps-Terkel's shop, clothes
have changed for many Stanford
men, the slacks having so completely
supplanted the cords and moleskins
that over three weeks have, passed
since they have sold a pair of mole
skins.
The hard - woven "depression",
pants have given way to the softer !
and rougher fabrics that will be
seen so often in all divisions of both
men's and women's clothes. Checks,
both narrow and wide, are popular
for the slack, though, of course the
solid color flannels will be seen.
