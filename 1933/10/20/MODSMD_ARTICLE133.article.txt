## 
### 
Welcome is the fashion edict that
gives men a chance to breathe in
their formal evening wear. From
Phelps-Terkel comes the announce
ment that comfort will be the main
! characteristic this fall.
i
Full-cuts, pleated trousers, loosely
fitting coats, shirts, with and with
out pleats, are all constructed to
give the wearer the greatest free
dom and are accepted as the smart
night wear.
Especially comfortable is the new
Grayco designed shirt for evenings.
It has a pleated front, attached col
lar, and is cut to insure freedom of
i prms and shoulders.
