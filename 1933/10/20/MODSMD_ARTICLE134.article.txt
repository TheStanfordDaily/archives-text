# ENGLAND DONATES ITS MITE IN GUISE OF CAMBRIDGE GRAY, BLUE FOR FASHION GLORY
## Coats With Three Buttons Give to Male Narrow Waist, Hip Effect 
### 
Even though the West heads ihe
collegiate world in athletics the
East seems to dominate in the field
of fashion. At least plenty of our
trends originate east of the Missis
sippi. ,
But even in the glory of all their
supremacy the East must admit that
it gets a few of its ideas from merry
England. True, about eight out of
ten new styles grow in America, but
that leaves two for England to
supply.
A year or so ago Oxford greys
and blues took the nation with a
storm of popularity that rose to un
precedented heights that not even
optimistic clothiers had anticipated.
But now it's a different story. It's
Cambridge grey and Cambridge
blue, both soft appealing tones.
And this year the coats have got
three buttons though the top one is
a sham. This lets the lower two
hold the coat in tight around the
waist and hips while the upper gives
the impression of broad shoulders
and full chest.
In the new roughish materials that
hold sway with the stylist the new
Cambridge-influenced suits are the
nth degree of swank.
