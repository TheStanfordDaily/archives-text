# Moderation in New Styles Benefits College Co-eds
## 
### 
The Greeks had a word for it: j
moderation. That seems to be the
tendency in fashions, at the mo
ment. Particularly does the City of
Paris believe this. Broad shoulders, I
thej say, but not so broad as they
have been. Very sporty coats, on ,
ihe whole, but some quite dressy.
The very fact that sophistication
and elegance are the keynotes to
day implies moderation. College
girls are in fact the ones to benefit
by this new vogue, which is for
sophistication simplified, even in its
most extreme creations.
Solid color shirts and shirts with
minute and intricate designs will be
demanded this fall, though the old
standby white shirt will also find 1
wearers. Shirts will be generally
conservative but with a feeling of |
individuality.
