# Elegant Gowns Replace "Round the Clock Frock
## 
### 
The "all around the clock frock'
is no longer with us. With the new
styles stressing simplicity in the af
ternoon and elegance in the evening,
it is not possible this season to wear
the same dress for afternoon tea
and again in the evening for dinner
dancing.
More dresses? Not necessarily,
fashion assures us. Instead ol two
all-around dresses, it is suggested
that the wise budgeter buy one
gown of each type. The afternoon
dress will probably be of black or
brown and evidence the popular
Chinese influence in its high neck
and tunic lines.
Dresses in which Stanford will
dance to the music of Ted Fio Rito
and Anson Weeks this fall show
definitely that the much discussed
elegance has come back. In color,
material, and style, they are richer
than last season's. It is an attrac
tive and popular fashion, for there
is real excitement in dressing up!
Slip into a luxurious velvet, lame,
or novelty crepe, trimmed with ko
linsky fur, top it all with a daring
little hat, and you feel like going
places.
Formals are even further on the
way back to the elegance of a more
pompous day. Most of them have
gone dignified with trains, vpry high
necks, and practically no backs.
More jewelry is worn this year in
keeping with the rhinestone straps
and belts that many of the gowns
feature.
The silhouette of the formal is
usually Mae Westish. It molds the
figure tightly to the knees, where
the flare Ls restrained at the sides
with a sweep at the back. Evening
wraps have gotten away f *un the
shorty jackets of last year, and are
mostly knee-length or longer.
Evening hats are an important

part of the 1931 wardrobe as there
is no substitute for them. Each out
fit should have its matching hat.
With dancing dresses, velvet and
satin are the best materials, made
in turban style. The long-popular
Schiaparelli hat, cocked over the
right eye, seems to be losing favor,
as the off-the-face trend in evening
ehapeaux is seen. Short, stiff veils
give v brim effect and form an al
luring halo for the eyes.

More jewelry is worn this year in
keeping with the rhinestone straps
and belts that many of the gowns
feature.
The silhouette of the formal is
usually Mae Westish. It molds the
figure tightly to the knees, where
the flare Ls restrained at the sides
with a sweep at the back. Evening
wraps have gotten away f *un the
shorty jackets of last year, and are
mostly knee-length or longer.
Evening hats are an important

part of the 1931 wardrobe as there
is no substitute for them. Each out
fit should have its matching hat.
With dancing dresses, velvet and
satin are the best materials, made
in turban style. The long-popular
Schiaparelli hat, cocked over the
right eye, seems to be losing favor,
as the off-the-face trend in evening
ehapeaux is seen. Short, stiff veils
give v brim effect and form an al
luring halo for the eyes.
