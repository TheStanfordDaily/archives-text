# LUMINOUS MAKEUP IS NEWEST FASHION AT MOVIE CAPITAL

### 
Phosphorus is luminous. But to
day luminosity rm-ans something
different. It means a finish to
one's complexion, as if soap and
water and a rough towel had just
been applied, with results, however,
more delicate than a rough towel
will permit.
Hollywood set the pace for high
lights and gleaming skins. '"Holly
wood luminous makeup" is'a sort
of paste which requires no care
ciuiing the day. It flatters the
wearer, by accenting the pretty
curves of a face.
