# MATCHED GROUPS OF ACCESSORIES ARE PRACTICAL
## Entire Outfit Will Appear In Same Material 
### 
In .spite of the seeming frivolity j
oi the new clothes, there is at least J
one very important point of practi- j
ci.lity about them. Accessories come I
in nattily matched groups.
Shoes, hat, gloves, and bag are all
of the same material and color,
forming an outfit which can be worn
with any of several dresses, and-f
rn;,ke each look finished. The vari- j
ety of materials makes it possible j
to find exactly what is needed. Gray
suede, for instance, for street clothes
of various colors; or woollen fabric
in bright colors, for sports wear;
velvet, in the gloves, too, for one's
chnner or formal gown.
I. Magnin and the White House j
are both showing satin evening I
gloves. Bright velvet for dark j
clothes, and black velvet gloves, hat
and bag for plain dresses illustrate
the note of contrast which is being
introduced this season. Antelope, i
velvet, and velveteen are a few 1
mere of the favorite materials.
Huge utility bag-, large enough to I
hold a week-end supply of necessi- i
ties, have returned to favor. Tap- !
estries are durable, moire somewhat j
more dressy. And petitpoint for j
afternoon wear is the last word in ;
refinement.

There was a time when gloves
were something that you wore only
on chilly days. Under the influence
of rakish Mae West gloves are now
being worn even on slightly v/arm
days.
Memories of the Gibson Girl era
are being revived in coat styles. In
1916 shoulders were literarry high
and wide—so they are in 1933 for
the discriminating buyer.
