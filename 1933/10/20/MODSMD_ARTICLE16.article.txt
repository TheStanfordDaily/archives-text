# RALPH WELLES' COMEDY OPENS
## "The Moulting Angel" In Palo Alto Tonight 
### James Sandoc 
With the opening tonight of Di
rector Ralph Emerson Welles' com
edy, "The Moulting Angel," the Palo
Alto Community Players offer their
fifth production of a full - length
play since the opening of their new
theatre.
The play concerns, among other
things, the effort of a play pro
ducer to finance a production of
what promises to be a great suc
cess. The "moulting angel" is a
rather simple-minded millionaire
who seems the most likely source
of money.
Welles plays the juvenile lead in
his own play and will be supported
by Janet Large, whose experience
4n the past includes study with
Katherine Jewel Everts and her
Elm Lea Players who toured New
England universities, Stanfordites
Joseph Lawrey, Frances Slanina,
and Joseph Whittaker.
Gretchen Rounds, also in the cast,
has had professional experience.
Lawyer Egerton Lakin makes his
first admittedly theatrical debut.
The play is scheduled to run to
night and tomorrow night and will
begin promptly at 8:15 o'clock. The
Players' orchestra, under the direc
tion of Fencer Elwyn Bugge—re
cently with the Stanford Symphony
Orchestra—will offer entr'acte mu
sic. Ticket reservations may be
made by telephoning the Commun
ity House, Palo Alto 21711, or tick
ets may be purchased at the box
office.
