# Salvation Army Spirit Attacks Sequoia Roughs
## 
### 
Sequoia Club has established a
variation of a Salvation Army choir
| and band.
Nearly every evening Sequoia
; "roughs" gather around the piano
in the lobby, and, with Ihe accom
paniment of a cornet and a guitar,
give expression to their vocal tal
ents. As to whether the "hymns"
sung are the same as those used by
the Salvation choirs was not deter
mined, but at least observers de
j clare that as much noise is made.
