# Stanford Cagey Dons Assail Uncrossed Goal
## Card Stage Favors Upset; "Tiny" Thornhill Anxious To Kill Overconfidence; Kickoff Called For 2:30 Tomorrow in Kezar Stadium 
### 
IX/ITII the stage favorably set for an upset, Stanford will go to San Fran
' cisco tomorrow to risk its virgin goal line against the three-time losers,
the San Francisco Dons. The game will be played at 2:30 o'clock in Ke
zar Stadium.
Coach "Tiny" Thornhill has been plunking the bug-a-boo with theme
j and variations on the Dons all week, and be is hoping that his crew will

►take the music to heart. Thornhill
is sincere in his doleful apprehen
sions, because he can remember the \
scrap that occurred last year when
Stanford had difficulty in downing
S.F.U. 20-7. That score was n*> in
dication of the relative strength of
the two football teams.
Papers Wrong
All the way back to Chicago j
Thornhill warned his men to be
wary of the newspaper accounts that
set Stanford up as an overwhelming
favorite to win from Northwestern.
The team evinced an admirable lack ;
of fear for the Wildcats and pro
ceeded to bump into a 0-0 tie.
Now Coach Thornhill is putting
out the same little earful about the
Dons; the boys nod and look wise,
and the coach worries because Stan- i
ford has been installed the same j
kind of favorite as they were over !
Northwestern.
S.F. Line Good
San Francisco has a really good
I line, starring Siemering at center j
i and Pecheu at guard. They had a
; brilliant pair of ends in Hinch and
Wilson, but Wilson is out of the
game, suffering injuries from the
i Oregon State affair of last week.
He is not playing on account of in
i juries, and is not ineligible as was
reported in the Daily recently.
Coach "Spud" Lewis also opened j
the season with a budding genius at
quarterback in the person of Jim ,
I Hall. Hall is not playing on account
I of scholastic difficulties
Veteran Backs
For a backfield Lewis will prob- '
: ably start Condray at fullback, and
Bradley at quarter. He has two
j experienced halves in Tudor and
Mclnnis.
Thornhill will lead with his cus
i .tomary left, which includes Moscrip
1 and Norgard, ends; Reynolds and
Callaway, tackles; O'Connor and
Corbus, guards; Bates, center; Sim,
quarter; Grayson, fullback; Maentz
and< Afflerbaugh, halves.
Big Ben Palamounlain, injured
in the Santa Clara game, will still
he on the shelf, and of course Boh
Hamilton, who has been out of
the drift of tilings since U.C.L.A.,
will he on the sidelines.
Stanford has undergone two real
! sweat sessions on the practice field
since their return from Chicago,
with emphasis laid on the funda
mentals of tackling and blocking.
; Thornhill believes the team was held
up a full week in their natural de- i
velopment by the Chicago trek. He '
expects them to pick up where they
j left off in the Santa Clara game. !

Unconvinced, dogmatic Ella Boole,
W.C.T.U. proxy, declares that she
and her sisterhood "do not believe
that the majority of the American
people want repeal." She charges
political corruption.

Hamilton, who has been out of
the drift of tilings since U.C.L.A.,

Stanford has undergone two real
! sweat sessions on the practice field
since their return from Chicago,
with emphasis laid on the funda
mentals of tackling and blocking.
; Thornhill believes the team was held
up a full week in their natural de- i
velopment by the Chicago trek. He '
expects them to pick up where they
j left off in the Santa Clara game. !

Unconvinced, dogmatic Ella Boole,
W.C.T.U. proxy, declares that she
and her sisterhood "do not believe
that the majority of the American
people want repeal." She charges
political corruption.
IX/ITII the stage favorably set for an upset, Stanford will go to San Fran
' cisco tomorrow to risk its virgin goal line against the three-time losers,
the San Francisco Dons. The game will be played at 2:30 o'clock in Ke
zar Stadium.
Coach "Tiny" Thornhill has been plunking the bug-a-boo with theme
j and variations on the Dons all week, and be is hoping that his crew will

►take the music to heart. Thornhill
is sincere in his doleful apprehen
sions, because he can remember the \
scrap that occurred last year when
Stanford had difficulty in downing
S.F.U. 20-7. That score was n*> in
dication of the relative strength of
the two football teams.
Papers Wrong
All the way back to Chicago j
Thornhill warned his men to be
wary of the newspaper accounts that
set Stanford up as an overwhelming
favorite to win from Northwestern.
The team evinced an admirable lack ;
of fear for the Wildcats and pro
ceeded to bump into a 0-0 tie.
Now Coach Thornhill is putting
out the same little earful about the
Dons; the boys nod and look wise,
and the coach worries because Stan- i
ford has been installed the same j
kind of favorite as they were over !
Northwestern.
S.F. Line Good
San Francisco has a really good
I line, starring Siemering at center j
i and Pecheu at guard. They had a
; brilliant pair of ends in Hinch and
Wilson, but Wilson is out of the
game, suffering injuries from the
i Oregon State affair of last week.
He is not playing on account of in
i juries, and is not ineligible as was
reported in the Daily recently.
Coach "Spud" Lewis also opened j
the season with a budding genius at
quarterback in the person of Jim ,
I Hall. Hall is not playing on account
I of scholastic difficulties
Veteran Backs
For a backfield Lewis will prob- '
: ably start Condray at fullback, and
Bradley at quarter. He has two
j experienced halves in Tudor and
Mclnnis.
Thornhill will lead with his cus
i .tomary left, which includes Moscrip
1 and Norgard, ends; Reynolds and
Callaway, tackles; O'Connor and
Corbus, guards; Bates, center; Sim,
quarter; Grayson, fullback; Maentz
and< Afflerbaugh, halves.
Big Ben Palamounlain, injured
in the Santa Clara game, will still
he on the shelf, and of course Boh
Hamilton, who has been out of
the drift of tilings since U.C.L.A.,
will he on the sidelines.
