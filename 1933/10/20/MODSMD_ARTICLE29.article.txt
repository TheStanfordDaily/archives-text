# BATTLE MARKS PUBLIC FORUM FIRST SESSION
## Shibley Halts Railroading Upsets Leaders Plans, But Truce Made VON BRETON ELECTED Liquor Control Chosen For Second Meet Topic 
### 
Smooth railroading, then factional
strife, then sudden settlement. That
was the order at the opening meet
ing of the newly formed Public
Forum in the Little Theatre last
night.
Prime-movers, including origi
nal prime-mover Hal von Breton,
began with everything well in
hand, Jerry Trautman well in the
chair as temporary master. So
well did the machinery work that
a complete set of officers were
elected.
Account had not been taken,
however, of the whip tongues of
Stanford's law school. George Shib
ley, from the institution so well
known for its steps, stepped in the
door and, before he had taken ,a
seat, moved that the elections be
reconsidered on the basis of a lack
of sufficient maturity to warrant
permanent organization.
Strife Begins
From then on factional strife held
the floor, Trautman held his gavel,
not many held their tongues. Von
Breton emerged as temporary chair
man, heard suggestions for future
discussion topics, and roughly offi
cered the organization by appoint
ment. All this temporary, including
Maxine Yaple, secretary, and an
organizing hoard : ouyiyung of Shih
ley, Bangs, Morris, Bold, Van Wage
nen, Fullenwider.
Topic for future talk adopted by
these wiseheads: Liquor Control to
be discussed within the next ten
days.
Organization adopted: subject to
further smoothing, beneficent bu
reaucracy, to choose two speakers,
affirmative and negative, and the
resolution to be moved. Speakers
will bo subject to interruption from
the floor to the extent of half their
time, discussion then to be thrown
open to the mob, discussion ended,
vote to be taken on l-esolution.
