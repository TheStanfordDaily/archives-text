# The 						Gentleman's Code
## 
### 
Xo professor hovers over you al Stanford when you
write (or try to write) an examination paper. No proctors
walk up and down the isles much in the manner of a
suspicious guard in a San Quenlin cell block. You sit there
free to do as you like.
That freedom is guaranteed only because Stanford men
and women have bunded together under an Honor ('ode.
That code gives them a full measure of self-esteem. They
are trusted. The I'niversity is risking the value of its
degree on the student's honor. And while the hit of
parchment may not mean much to the student who pumps
gasoline after graduation, it means everything to the I'ni
versity.
The Honor Code places everyone on his honor. Hut
everyone cannot be trusted. The brutal way would be to
penalize all for the possible dishonesty of a few. Stanford
men and women have not followed that course. They have
chosen the gentleman's way. Any student who is seen
cheating is noted by his fellow-classmates. He is marked
as unfit; and either leaves the I'niversity at his own voli
tion or is removed by the student Council. That is the
theory of the Code, and if the theory remains only a the
ory, the Code will follow the Hon fire to unmourned obli
vion.
The responsibility is a keen one. Kaclr student must
keep himself above suspicion. Stanford's Honor Code an
tedates the present era of Codes by some years; but it has
the same motto. Each must do his part.
