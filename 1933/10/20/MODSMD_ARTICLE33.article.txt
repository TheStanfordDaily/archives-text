Our famous Governor Rolph "came through" again yes
terday with another of liis well-known attempts to gain
voles when he gallantly ordered a prison warden to give
Dallas ftgan, a hangee-to-be, "all the whiskey he can stand
up under when he mounts the 1.3 steps."
Kgan, who can think of nothing better than to drop
through the gallows, according to his own statement, is to
be hanged for an offense against society. He is a criminal,
one whose activities have been cruel, treacherous, vile. Yet
Governor Rolph,! who says he is opposed to capital pun
ishment, will let the man hang by the neck until he is dead
:!iid pass it off by violating federal law.
Rolph comes up for re-election next year, hoping to
achieve the distinction of being returned for a second term,
an honor held only by Hiram Johnson. Such inconsisten
cies as these, added to other mistakes of many natures
which our gardenia-wearing, baby-kissing, road-opening,
cow-milking, sky-fly ing, glad-handing, beautv-coronating,
Grecian-clothed state executive has made, certainly won't
garner many votes for him from the CaJjfornians who
claim tliev possess elements which make up common sense.
â€”R. L.
