# On Crossing Bridges
## 
### 
As soon as an idea becomes mummified into a maxim,
the idea should he dropped. Foremost mummy that should
1 ><• dropped: "Don't cross a bridge until you eome to it."
I liis is a hoinev, folksy hit of learning that is continually
Hung in one's face much like a cold dishrag. Just as
deadening. Just as annoying. Just as pointless.
Suggest a new idea and the "practical" people (one's
elders; by immediate assumption, one's betters) will lush,
lush you into silence with that one great cure-all, "wait
fill we come to the bridge.'' The Knglish have made it a
national fetish and revel in their ability to "muddle
through."
Why wait till you come to the brink? Why not figure
out some crossings in advance? That is the intelligent al
titude. The instinctive attitude of avoiding the unpleasant
would dejiv a chasm till the brink is reached. Bridges,
there usually are. So we hope that our chasm will have its
bridge.
Hut some don't. And then we drop off into a nasty situ
ation like the Depression, or Prohibition, and very prob
ably Repeal (except, perhaps, for the intensive Rockefeller
study). And what holds true for the nation, holds true for
this segment of the continent, the Stanford Campus. Those
among students and administration that cross the bridges
in advance are the only ones that arc sure of getting to
the other side.
