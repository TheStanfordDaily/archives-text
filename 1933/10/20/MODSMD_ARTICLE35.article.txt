Recently convening in the ICast, that assemblage of
heroic world-savers, the American Legion, passed a reso
lution to the effect that they disapprove of crime.
At llrst glance, this does not appear to be of much im
port. To disapprove of crime is hardly news. May as well
pass a resolution condemning piracy, or- approving of char
ily, or explaining that Santa Claus is only a mythical char
acter.
Hut on second thought, perhaps this is news. For the
American Legion to speak out against crime—well, isn't
that like the man biting the dog? Haven't we witnessed
crimes perpetrated for years by this very group which now
pretends to turn moral?
This gesture will not make us forget the numerous
bonus grabs, nor the drunken, property-damaging Legion
conventions held in San Francisco and elsewhere.
