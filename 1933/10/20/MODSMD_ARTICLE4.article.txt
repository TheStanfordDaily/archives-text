# No War Plansâ€”Hitler
## 
### 
There will definitely be no war as
far as Germany is concerned, states
Hitler. "We leaders of the Nazi
movement were almost without ex
ception in the trenches and I would
like to see the trench soldier who
prepares enthusiastically for war."
At the same time Nazi finance min
ister announced a tax reduction for
individuals advancing German air
defenses. Hitler claims his big
problem is preparing for the coming
winter of depression.
France and England are still full
of reports of all sorts of warlike
German plans concerning colonies,
Polish corridor, and arms factories
ir. Sweden and Holland.
For some reason the League's
present ray of artificial sunshine is
that the U.S. will recognize Russia
and Russia will enter the League.
In Paris the cabinet is crumbling,
the budget won't balance, and the
franc is tumbling.
