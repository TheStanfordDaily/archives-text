FANCY MONIKERS
(.11 EOIT'S. GOAT

The deplorable practice of apply
ing catchwords to various functions,
phases, operators, and parts of a
lootball team is our pet aversion.
Every week we growl and grit our
teeth over the whole matter, and
every week there is something new
which provides adequate stimulus
for more growling and gritting.
The last irritating phrase which
was loosed on an unsuspecting army
<>* fans and sports column readers
was the "cobra clutch" as practiced
by St. Mary's Gordon Partee. This
week Ihere is another to match it
lor sheer over-stuffed publicityâ€”
we learn that Irvine Warburton is
no longer "Cottontop" Warburton.
He is now officially dubbed by the
Southern California Amalgamated
and Associated Convention of Pub
licity Men, Sports Writers, and
Home Town Boosters as "Warbur
ton, the White Flame of Troy."
F'-oey!
