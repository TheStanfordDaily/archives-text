# JUST A LULL BEFORE THE STORM
## 
### 
On ,the front, the Pacific Coast
J?''id situation appears calm, gentle,
peaceful this week. Everything is
•supposed to be soft, with the Big
Three of Stanford, U.S.C., and Cali
fornia taking their opponents in
stride, and holding things back in
preparation for the critical games of
next week, Stanford vs. Washington
and Southern California vs. Califor
nia.
Don't be surprised if this proves
merely to be the lull before the
storm. Washington State is cer
tainly no pushover for the Bears,
and Stanford is no 50 to 1 shot to
slap over the Dons. Well, what was
the other game, Oscar. Oh, yes,
U.S.C. plays Oregon State, at Port
land. II the Beavers win this one,
it'll be the biggest yarn since Joe
Blumpf started the modern game of
football by picking up a ball and
running with admirable disregard
for the rules 'way back at Harvard,
or Yale, or one of those other ob
scure Eastern places in umpty-ump.
But never forget Oregon State has
«'! lad named Red Franklin who may
she >w any admirable disregard for
traditions and run to a touchdown
against the Trojan himself.
The Eastern games that hold our
attention this week are Minnesota
against Pittsburgh and good old
Michigan against Ohio State.
