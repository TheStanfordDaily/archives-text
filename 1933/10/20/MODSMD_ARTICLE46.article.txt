## 
### 
The big speculative problem
though, is what new star halfback
or end or guard will come up from
the California Ramblers after to
morrow's game. And what first
string man will be shoved down to
replace the new man. And what
kind of a system do they employ
where the coach never knows
where his material lies until mid
season?
The bulletin is officially posted
declaring that Hunk Anderson is
definitely through this year, whether
he wins, draws, or loses. It seems
the Notre Dame faculty is
searching, lantern in hand, for a
combination Sunday-school teacher,
philosopher, character builder, and
personality man who will also stick
;< round of a Saturday afternoon and
lead the Fighting Irish to a few
rational championships. Mr. Clipper
Smith of neighboring Santa Clara
has been favorably mentioned for
the job.
