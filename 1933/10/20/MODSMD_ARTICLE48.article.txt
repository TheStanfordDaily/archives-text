# Crippled Frosh Eleven Faces Menlo
## YEARLING MORALE UNPHASED; VIGNA, WILLIAMSBENCHED 
### Charles Chappell 
Handicapped by injuries but de
termined to continue their early
season successes, Coach Jimmie
Bradshaw's freshmen gridders v/i! 1
meet the Menlo J.C. eleven at 10
i'clock tomorrow morning in the
Stanford Stadium.
With Joe Vigna, signal-calling
left half, definitely out of the game
with an injured knee cartilage,
and Fred Williams, star goal
kicker, probably scheduled to
decorate the bench, injuries have
struck particularly hard at the
frosh hai'kficld.
Williams is suffering from a mys
terious abdominal injury about
which little seems to be known.
Even if it does not result seriously,
the chances are that he will see lit
tle action tomorrow.
Turretto to Play
In case Williams does join Vigna
among the injured, Cliing will play
loft half with Grigo Turretto, San
Jose's gift to Stanford punting, mov
ing into the right half job.
Chuck Ledbetter, though still car
rying a bandaged right hand, will
don some sort of protective device
and continue his playing habit of
bowling over would-be tacklers
from his regular first-string full
back job.
Williamson Injured
Either Voigt or Wingfield will hold
down the quarterback berth while
Jack Geisen will take Kay William
son's place at guard. Williamson is
still handicapped by a strained mus
cle but will probably play some,
nevertheless.
Ralph Quails, rapidly improving
pivot man, gets the call at center
over George Bergman, though the
latter will doubtless see plenty of I
action. Both have been pretty much 1
on a par throughout the season.
Starting Line-up
The tentative starting line-up for
Stanford follows: Chouteau and
Schott, ends; Beedle and Tsoutsou- i
vas, tackles; Geisen and Walton,
guards; Quails, center; Voigt, quar-»
terback; Ching and Turretto, half
backs; and Led v '<er, fullback.
Though the iforcl Babes nor
mally would nave the edge in
potential strength, (he Menlo eleven :
has shown considerable power so far '
this season and io handicapped by
only a couple of injuries.
Menlo Powerful
The Oaks held Sacramento J.C.
to a 7-6 score, while the Capiial
City team earlier m the season wal
loped San Jose State 20 to 8, about
as badly as the Stanford varsity
were able to do in their first game.
Whether the foregoing mathema
tical computation tells anything of!
Menlo's strength will probably be |
settled in the morning when the In
dian freshmen try to make it three
in a row over the Jaysee members
of their schedule.
with 82 points. . . . Breakers and El
Toro hold all records for the mural
spring relays except the four-man
mile which is held by a team from
Encina lIIE. . . .
Jimmy Bradshaw, freshmen foot
ball coach, is co-holder csf the Uni
versity handball championship. . . .
Douglas Lewis, competing for Beta
Theta Pi set the University golf
driving record in 1928 with a 305-
yard drive. . . . Bobby Grayson twice
won the Oregon State High School
100-yard dash title. Grayson's times
were 10.1 and 9.9. ... El Toro and
Phi Kappa Sigma tied for the Ail-
Around Intramural championship
last year with 200 points each. "

Williams is suffering from a mys
terious abdominal injury about
which little seems to be known.

Turretto to Play
In case Williams does join Vigna
among the injured, Cliing will play
loft half with Grigo Turretto, San
Jose's gift to Stanford punting, mov
ing into the right half job.
Chuck Ledbetter, though still car
rying a bandaged right hand, will
don some sort of protective device
and continue his playing habit of
bowling over would-be tacklers
from his regular first-string full
back job.
Williamson Injured
Either Voigt or Wingfield will hold
down the quarterback berth while
Jack Geisen will take Kay William
son's place at guard. Williamson is
still handicapped by a strained mus
cle but will probably play some,
nevertheless.
Ralph Quails, rapidly improving
pivot man, gets the call at center
over George Bergman, though the
latter will doubtless see plenty of I
action. Both have been pretty much 1
on a par throughout the season.
Starting Line-up
The tentative starting line-up for
Stanford follows: Chouteau and
Schott, ends; Beedle and Tsoutsou- i
vas, tackles; Geisen and Walton,
guards; Quails, center; Voigt, quar-»
terback; Ching and Turretto, half
backs; and Led v '<er, fullback.
