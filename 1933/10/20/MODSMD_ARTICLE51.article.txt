# STROUSE, WHITE OUT IN SAN JOSE SOCCER BATTLE
## Cards Prepare for Game Saturday, Show Good Practice Form 
### 
A wise San Jose soccer varsity,
which beat Stanford's team in a
practice scrimmage early in the sea
son when the Indian soccermen
were but three days awake, wUI
face a wide-awake set of warriors
tomorrow morning.
Wide-awake as they may he,
however, and strengthened by
long practices and rearrangements
in the line-up, the Indians will he
weakened by the temporary in
eligibility of Doug Kennedy and
the inability of Dick Strouse and
Waddy White to turn out tomor
row.
Such wear as the soccer field will
suffer Saturday will be largely on
San Jose's turf, if the halfbacks and
fullbacks can perform as they have
in practice. Strouse's absence will
be felt at fullback but Cy Johnson's
power-boot and Rod Lewis' playing
will compensate this largely. With
a capable roving center half, John
nie Moore, supported by two unruly
and clever halfs, Rudy Gonzales and
Johnny Hitchcock, this position will
still be dynamically played.
Good Lineup
As for the forward line, there is
an abundance of good material wiih
which to shoot the leather pelota
between San Jose's posts in their
mest. If Carl Knecht, Albert Na
varro, and Art Hearn, who will at
tack the enemy goalie from the left
wing, play as well as they did Wed
nesday against a good freshman
team, all will go well for Stanford.
I Having five outstanding forwards
from whom to fill the other two ag
| gressive positions, Harry Maloncy
will probably be able to arrange a
co-operating offense. These five
hooters are: Miguel Gomez, Sven
Dcddington, Chuck Emeriek, Carl
Krfhs, and Stan Moy.
Men Back Soon
Having met the San Jose team, the
Stanford team will have only Mon
day practice before meeting the San
Mateo J.C.'s dangerous team on
Wednesday. Strouse and White will
be back, and Coach Maloney will
be able to have judged and strate
gically placed his soccer chessmen,
so a close hard-fought game may be
expected both tomorrow and Wed
nesday.
Freshmen soccermen, organized
into the best first-year team in some
time, will begin its schedule of
games within the week. A number
| of experienced kickers, notably Ed
Washburn and Pete Knecht, bol
ster up the team and gave it suffi
; cient power to get in the varsity's
hair in Wednesday scrimmage. That
it let five goals into the goalmouth
merely showed its lack of practice.
