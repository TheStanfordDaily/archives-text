Zululand, October 18. ,
Far into these jungles we have
pushed our search for suitable ma- :
terial. Gargantuan Gridiron Gau
ehos. who will strike terror into the
meek hearts of the once Happy
Chappies.
We hold the Hammer; Chaparral
wi'l do well to prepare their Coffin!
But yesterday, scurrying through 1
the tall grasses which infest this
region, we came across a specimen,
the like of which wi'l inspire the
universal envy of Pacific Coast Con
ference coaches.
He is a handsome beastie, whose
underslung forehead sets off to ad- 1
vantage a frame that soars eight
feet, into the ether. Muscle? The
thing is all muscle; his very head
is a muscle; body and soul, he is
one gigantic muscle, unfeeling, un

â€¢ abashed, vigorous.
He is hardy of fibre, eats deli
cately of whole hams and orange
juice. But what is probably of
greater significance, he will work
cheap. Room and board, a suit of
homespun, and lie is content to sit.
reflecting on why his right thumb
should be larger than the left. In a
! way. we may ballyhoo him as the
"Football Filosopher." After foot
ball season, we could profitably use
him to move pianos, carry trunks,
or dig ditches. In these arts he ex
cels.
"Bimbo," that's his name, has vol
unteered to bring along his little
brother to help things along. "Bim
bette,'' that's the little fellow, weighs
but 350 pounds on the hoof. Hfe can
form our forward wall!
