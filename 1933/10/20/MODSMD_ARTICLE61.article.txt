v
The University Philological Asso
ciation will meet Thursday, October
20, at 4:15 at the Women's Club
house. Two discussions, "On the
Trail of the Folktale" by J. C. Reid I
of the Romanic Languages Depart
ment, and "Fusion and Confusion in
the. English Language" by Professor
A. G. Kennedy of the English De
partment, will be the features of the
program.
Encouragement of research is the
chief aim of the Association, ac
cording to Frank O. Copley, secre
tary. To many a graduate student '
or professor, the final step before'
<ne actual publishing of a paper is
'its oral presentation at a meeting
and the subsequent general discus- j
sion.
1 In. this way the author often re
ceives not only encouragement, but
also some helpful suggestions. For
instance, he may be shown some j
way in which a certain impoi'tant j
point could be better emphasized or
someone may show him how a
particularly involved explanation .
might be simplified.
An election will be held Thursday
also and a new set of officers will
supplant Mrs. Frances T. Strong,
president, and Frank O. Copley, sec
retary.
