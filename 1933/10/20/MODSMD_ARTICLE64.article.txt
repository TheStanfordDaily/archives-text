# HARVARD DRAWS MAN-HUNTERS TO SUMMER SESSION
## 
### 
More women come to Harvard for
husbands than for degrees, is the 1
opinion of Harold W. Bradley, in
structor in history, who has returned
from a summer of research at Har
vard. The hunting season is brief; |
Harvard admits women only to the
short summer session.
Hawaiian history, Bradiey's spe
cial interest, occasioned his trip to
Cambridge. Since no adequate Ha
waiian histories exist, Harvard's ex
tensive collection of original maiiu- "
scripts is the most authentic source
of information available. Between
traders' letters and missionaries' di
aries, Dr. Bradley found time for
friends in and about Boston.
