# "500" JITTERS AS "300" OUTDRESSES HOLD-OVER GIRLS

i ,
Far-famed Stanford's "500"
jittered last spring as the Board
of Trustees opened wide the
pearly gates to admit 350 more
| women. This fall as remaining
i members of the old guard got
their first glimpses of the new
females they jittered again.
Swanky looking clothes
caused the second jitter. It was
all because after the first week
on the campus and the Reg
dance general consensus of
; opinion gave the new women
a decided edge in the way of
dre?s. Dresses straight from
Paris salons put to shame those
of the common "city" variety,
i But Paris is still as far away
as ever and the old "500" are
i still jittering.
