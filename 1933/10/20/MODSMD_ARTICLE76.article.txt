### 
Last week in the stores of the na
: tion's haberdashers appeared a new
quarterly for men modeled along.
j the lines for women's "Vogue." Its
1 name: "Esquire. The Quarterly for i
I Men."
To sell at 50c, "Esquire" presents
I 116 pages of shining paper. Most !
j inviting to men was its table of!
contents listing articles of no spe
i cial merit except that they had "an I
especial appeal to men."
Presenting stories by Charley ,
Paddock, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr..
Bobby Jones, Gene Tunney, Vincent '
Starrett, and Ring Lardner among j
| others, the magazine is of real inter
est only to men as it is meant to be.
Cartoons in black and white, col
ors by such twisters as Alajalov,
' Steig, Groth, and four others as well
as funny pieces by George Ade,
Glass, Hershfield represent the scin- ]
1 tillant humor department.
Fourteen pages with colored style i
illustrations for men include ap
parel from that of the college man
to the extreme racegoer.

Sleeveless sweaters are very pop
ular and may be worn with either
sport coats or coat sweaters of ei
iher harmonizing or contrasting
colors.
According to latest shoe informa
tion even Grecian flat sandals can
b > worn for evening occasions.
