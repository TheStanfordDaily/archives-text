# 'College Men Set Pace For U.S. Style Chiefs
## Universities Considered Testing Ground For New Fashions 
### 
While professional clothiers tra-!
ditionally turn to London for their :
men's styles, in fact nearly eight out j
of ten of the modes originate in j
i American universities and colleges, j
This has been 'explained by the j
natural abundance of energy stored ;
in modern youth that finds an out
-1 let in creation. Coupled with the
fact that they have the courage of
their convictions and will wear a i
new style in preference to an old, ;
it is not difficult to see how college :
men set the trend.
Colleges are the testing grounds
for new ideas that eventually sift >
out into the business world either :
in the original or modified form.
It was the college men who broke
us of the habit of wearing high
choke collars, "iron mike" derbies, i
sausage tight trousers, and suede- j
topped button shoes. The trend is
now pointed for complete comfort
in clothes for any occasion.
This season campus style setters
are given credit for the looser fit- j
ting, lighter construction suits that I
have proved so popular—the feath- i
erweight crushy "vagabondish" felt |
hats that can be sat upon or stepped j
upon without much damage being j
done —the narrow brimmed felt hat I
especially blocked so that it will
turn up nearly flat against the'
crown in the back, and also the i
rows and rows of stitching that runs
around the brim.
College men have also been in
strumental in reviving the style of
the full-cut military collared Bal-,
macaan topcoat. The style itself,
isn't new but has merely been lying
idle for several years. This revival i
trend was started by Princeton and
Harvard men and is now generally
considered the ace-high coat across j
America.
To be well dressed depends on a
few elemental factors which are
developed in any authentic fashion, i
The smaller details such as the cut
of lapel have been more or less j
neglected by the modem style men 1
who have turned their attention to .
the broader changes in construc
tion and design which influence the j
whole product.
In recent years style trends have 1
incorporated three main features.;
The first important element that
must be followed is simply good! i

taste, which of course means the |
fitness of the attire for its purpose j
and the sincerity of its conception •
and production. Comfort, always
an important issue, must be thor
oughly ingrained in any new fash
ion if it is to live long. The third
requisite is acceptance. To he ac
ceptable the creation must not be 1
so affected or frivolous as to turn
the stomach.
Pacific Coast men have found
that they need not make the dis
tinction that Easterners do between j
town and country wear. Bankers
dress like students who dress like
traveling men who dress like bank
ers. A soft collar is worn in the
classroom or in the office of big
business moguls. This can possibly
be attributed to the fact that live
major universities around the bay
area play an important part in set
ting the fashion trends.
Giant crinkles are dead, but mildly
rough crepes are very much alive.

It was the college men who broke
us of the habit of wearing high
choke collars, "iron mike" derbies, i
sausage tight trousers, and suede- j
topped button shoes. The trend is
now pointed for complete comfort
in clothes for any occasion.
This season campus style setters
are given credit for the looser fit- j
ting, lighter construction suits that I
have proved so popular—the feath- i
erweight crushy "vagabondish" felt |
hats that can be sat upon or stepped j
upon without much damage being j
done —the narrow brimmed felt hat I
especially blocked so that it will
turn up nearly flat against the'
crown in the back, and also the i
rows and rows of stitching that runs
around the brim.
College men have also been in
strumental in reviving the style of
the full-cut military collared Bal-,
macaan topcoat. The style itself,
isn't new but has merely been lying
idle for several years. This revival i
trend was started by Princeton and
Harvard men and is now generally
considered the ace-high coat across j
America.
To be well dressed depends on a
few elemental factors which are
developed in any authentic fashion, i
The smaller details such as the cut
of lapel have been more or less j
neglected by the modem style men 1
who have turned their attention to .
the broader changes in construc
tion and design which influence the j
whole product.
In recent years style trends have 1
incorporated three main features.;
The first important element that
must be followed is simply good! i

taste, which of course means the |
fitness of the attire for its purpose j
and the sincerity of its conception •
and production. Comfort, always
an important issue, must be thor
oughly ingrained in any new fash
ion if it is to live long. The third
requisite is acceptance. To he ac
ceptable the creation must not be 1
so affected or frivolous as to turn
the stomach.
Pacific Coast men have found
that they need not make the dis
tinction that Easterners do between j
town and country wear. Bankers
dress like students who dress like
traveling men who dress like bank
ers. A soft collar is worn in the
classroom or in the office of big
business moguls. This can possibly
be attributed to the fact that live
major universities around the bay
area play an important part in set
ting the fashion trends.
Giant crinkles are dead, but mildly
rough crepes are very much alive.
While professional clothiers tra-!
ditionally turn to London for their :
men's styles, in fact nearly eight out j
of ten of the modes originate in j
i American universities and colleges, j
This has been 'explained by the j
natural abundance of energy stored ;
in modern youth that finds an out
-1 let in creation. Coupled with the
fact that they have the courage of
their convictions and will wear a i
new style in preference to an old, ;
it is not difficult to see how college :
men set the trend.
