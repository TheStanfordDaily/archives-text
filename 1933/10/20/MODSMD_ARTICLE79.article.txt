# LADIES EVENING WRAPS PRACTICAL AND DECORATIVE
## Short Sleeves And Coats Finding Much Favor 
### 
Milady will be happy to learn that i
evening wraps are going to be both
practical and decorative. They will
be practical because most of them |
are going to be black and so can be
worn with any other color and dec
orative because of the sleeve and
shoulder effects that are so smart
now.
The newest evening coats are
three - quarter or fingertip length,
though the practical and tremen
dously popular short jacket is be
ing shown in most stores. A bright
novelty clip at the neck,will offset
a black coat wonderfully.
Sleeve fashions differ but are gen- j
erally found to be about elbow |
length or perhaps a trifle longer. J
One popular coat has huge puff
sleeves that reach near elbow length j
while another equally as popular .
has wide bottom sleeves and is a ;
little longer.
If you are not so economical and I
practical that you choose a black ;
coat, a bright red evening wrap or I
short jacket will give an extra dash j
to your ensemble.
