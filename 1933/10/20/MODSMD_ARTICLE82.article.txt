# Wools Shown As Vogue for Day Dresses
## Berets to Match Sweaters And Suits Popular This Autumn 
### 
Fashion has the woollies! (Pardon
us, please.) And the woollier and
rougher and hairy-er your daytime
clothes are the smarter you are.
Materials that look as if they
would shed like a cat don't do any- j
thing of the kind, but stand up very
well under hard wear. The angoras
and kitten's - ear and rabbit - wool
fabrics of last year are still popu
lar, supplemented by the much-ad
vertised sturdy tweeds.
Quad clothes and street clothes
are of woolen, of course; but wool
is by no means confined to these
two types of clothes. Sheer, sheer
wool is seen in some of the loveliest,
of the afternoon dresses and even
ventures into the formal field.
Stitched woolen fabric hats and
piquant soft hairy berets to comple
ment suits and sweaters are very
good.
The smooth flannels and wool
crepes, Botany and the like, have
lost favor with fashion dictators.
Even separate skirts arc most of
them made of the nubby, rugged
looking wools.
"A definite change in formal
fashions is the use of hair orna
ments. All the women have taken
it up."â€”Babette.
