# Feminine Hat Styles Appeal To All Tastes
## Chinese Influence Is Noted In Many Numbers 
### 
This business of buying bonnets
for winter days and nights is a joy
and a delight, what with the vari
ety of styles and colors being shown
in the marts of trade. No one can
sound the old lament, "Oh, these
new hats look simply awful on me,"
this season; for there is a hat of and
for every type.
New and exciting are the hats
that show the Chinese influence, pa
goda and mandarin styled, and the
very recent ofT-the-face numbers
that are a refreshing departure from
the over-the-eye models that are
seen constantly.
Little woolly hairy berets and
turbans are still very much in favor,
particularly when they match or
complement sweaters 01* suits. The
cuff-brimmed mandarin skull-caps
are trimmed with fetching bows or
tiny tiered glass ornaments. Feath
ers trim both day-time and dress
hats, small ones perching on sport
hats graduating into ostrich plumes
for formal occasions.
For evening maline is the newest
favorite, being combined with vel
vet in many instances. Brims are
good for evening wear, even though
your escort may not like them in
the eye. A narrow brim of maline
or a minute stiffened veil is most
flattering as well as very new.
Brims, say fashion arbiters, may
be wide, medium, narrow, or minus
completely. So if your best points
are brought out by a wide brim
which silhouettes the profile, now
is your chance to wear one. As for
crowns, fall predictions were that
the high crowns were to be "the
thing," but they need not be if they
do not suit you, because high, low,
and medium crowns are to be found
on the most fashionable heads.
As for colors, hats as always come
in the shades that are being shown
in sport and dress clothcs, tile tones,
grays, navy browns and tans, and
blacks predominate for sport, with
blacks and browns the most popu
lar evening choices.
Most of the hats are still down
over the eye, but the off-the-face
trend is growing stronger, say buy
ers, and is expected to increase.
Sport l'elts and turbans are
showing this influence now.
