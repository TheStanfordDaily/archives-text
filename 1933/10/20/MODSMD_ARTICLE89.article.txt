# Travel Coats Have New Fur For Trimming
## Wolf, Lynx, Skunk in Light Colors Used on New Women's Wraps 
### 
That coat of all uses, long known
as the "travel coat," is reappearing
again this year bat with new dis
tinguishing styles.
Three new furs are used for the
trimming, though not strictly new
but merely fashionable again. The
coats themselves are made from
tweeds in mottled or monotone fab
rics as usual with long-haired furs
used to add the decoration.
The three unusual furs that have
made their appearan'ce this season
are white wolf, lynx, and white I
skunk. These furs are very light,
creamy or definitely white, and may
be used on almost any colored coat
with effect. Practically the only
color that these, light furs cannot be j
used with is gray.
Coats can be brown, very light
beige, the popular color for new 1
dressy sport coats, or a brighter hue
like green or blue.
Of the three furs, the lynx is the ■
longest, having wavy feathery edges. |
White skunk and white polar wolf
are heavier and coarser, though all
three look well on heavy, wide col
lar shapes.
Naturally these furs are not the
only ones that can be used on travel
: and sport coats. The soft plush-like
furs of beaver and nutria are fash
ionable on light beige sport wraps.
For mushroom collars on tweed
coats the old favorite badger is still
being used.
