If your future is filled with danc
ing men, there's nothing you need
more than a breath-taking formal
to put the new life into you. And
I. Magnin's suggests rose-heige lace
shot with gold metallic thread, sim
ply fashioned with the high-jn
frontline, covered shoulders, and
waistline decolletage.
As for afternoon —well, we simply
yearned for a little black number
we spotted on the Roos racks. It
was black faille, one of the season's
best fabrics, with a large sailor col
lar of white galyak and long sleek
sleeves cuffed in the same. Black
cire bows at the neck and cuff com
pleted the smart accents.
The Big Game, than which there
is nothing bigger in Stanford sports,
calls for something super in the way
of clothes. Liebes' has it—a yellow
wool with a vague plaid effect in
brown threads, belted in wide brown
suede and buttoned with square j
wooden buttons. This, plus a brown
sports coat and one of those little
hats Hinks' makes to match your
frocks is guaranteed to stagger even
the Rally Committee.
The Clothes Closet brags about a
1 red velvet jacket which may trans
! form a last year's dress. It is short
and fastened surprisingly with a
good sized hook and eye made of
rhinestones. Very fetching. Also at
this shop are found the new evening
hats that leave the forehead practi
cally bare and hide the roll at the
back, if you are still wearing one.
Hosiery is most popular this sea
son in brown shades, with the gun
metals and smoke-tones running a
i close second.
