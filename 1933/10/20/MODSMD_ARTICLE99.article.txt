# SHIRTWAIST ERA RECURS AHEAD OF TIME; SLEEVES AND NECK GET MUCH ATTENTION
## Tunics, Crepe Blouses, And Bright Sweaters Can Be Worn With Same Skirt 
### 
The Shirtwaist Era is a name
( given by historians to the Mauve
Decade (also known as the Gay
'i)o's). Every nine years since then
there has been a recurrence of
| blouses and skirts, in a sort of orgy.
This year's deluge is proving impor
tant because of its arrival, with
apologies to the Plague, on the sev
enth year.
Variety on even the slender poc
ketbook results. Rich tunics, crepe
blouses, bright sweaters all can be
worn with the same skirt; and who
can say that the top half is not the
more important, these days, with
sleeves and necks perhaps the most
important features of the new
styles?
Suits, as merely glorified shirt- i
waist-and-skirts, are back with a
j flourish. The White House shows
i them in every conceivable color; in |
contrasting weaves for skirt and '
sweater and coat; in varying lengths I
1 â€”fingertip being the newest, but j
short hip length also good for the '
| very mannish suits.
Dark blouses with dark skirts are |
j emphasized by I. Magnin. And j
| there, as in every shop, the twin j
; sweater, such as the Mauve Decade j
never saw, certainly, clamors for at- I
tention.
