# Stanford Takes to Air Game As Dons' Line Nullifies Running Attack
## 
### Spud Hamilton 
The dope bucket went for a rough
ride in Kezar Stadium Saturday. It
endured all the tribulations of a
bumpy shoot-the-chutes and rattled
out of the final slide just in time to
j beat the closing gun and smear a big
20-13 on the scoreboard. So there
j you have it, Stanford 20, San Fran
' cisco Dons 13.
Twenty thousand startled fans saw
a renovated Thornhill offense battle
a scrapping San Francisco line in
about the weirdest, wildest, crazy
6i) minutes of football played in Ke
zar in some many moons. It cer
tainly was not the acme of technical
play, designed to edify the football
purist, but for the rabble of rooting
sections and the citizens looking for
a thrill, it had what it takes.
Cards Have Trouble
Yes, it was a complete vindication
ol the dope, which said San Fran
cisco would give the Cards plenty
of trouble. It said that San Fran
j cisco would score and they did; it
said Stanford's passing attack would
; blossom when the ground game
failed to gain, and so it did. And it
said Stanford would grab a close
victory—and they did.
In the first few minutes of the
game, promise of the wild afternoon
to follow came when Maentz fum
bled the first Don punt and gave
S.F.U. the ball on the Stanford 44-
vard line. Tuoor kicked to the
Stanford 27 and it looked bad for the
Cards. On the next play Grayson
; turned the ball loose on a pass to
Moscrip that the latter took on the
Stanford 45 and raced to a score.
Corbus' kick made it 7-0.
Dons Come Back
The Dons came back and pro
ceeded to outplay Stanford com
pletely. Although their backfield j
was as ragged and unpolished as a j
backfield could be, their line tossed
tl a . Stanford giants hither" and yon
and was responsible for keeping the ]
Indians deep in their own territory.
Tlie Dons' best drive' ended on the
Stanford 5-yard line with no telling
what was to happen when Condray
fumbled and Bill Sim recovered.
After the San Francisco men had
hovered around the Stanford scoring
territory for nearly a quarter, it
! seemed like the Cards were out of
the hole, when Corbus recovered a
fumble on their own 40-yard stripe.
But on the next play Sim juggled
a bad pass and when it seemed that
1 lie finally had it tight, the fans dis
covered that Barber of the Dons
was galloping away to a touchdown.
With the score tied, Thornhill,
: desperately, trying to drag Stanford
