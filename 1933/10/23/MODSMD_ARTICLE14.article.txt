# Football Given Approval By Members of Faculty
## 
### CHARLOTTE BURRIDGE 
EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the first of three articles giving the reactions
of Stanford professors to modern-day football.

i Football, over-emphasized amuse- |
ment for thrill-seeking adults, is
, redeemed by the fact that the bene-
I fits resulting from it as a creator of,
| better sportsmanship, outlet for j
| youthful enthusiasm, and builder of
! student morale outweigh its admit
i ted evils.
Authorities for this statement are
the Stanford professors interviewed
on the subject of undergraduate
feet ball, and the registrar who pre
| sents facts to prove athletics non
injurious to scholastic rating.
Registrar Mitc h c 1 I proudly
shows the compiled figures to
prove that scholastic rating of
Stanford athletes averages close to
the normal 2.55. Records show
that the grades of football players
are not affected much in the quar
ter of active work.
Helps Morale
"It takes a little too much time," (
( he says, "and there's a lot of bally- I
i hoo about it, but. on the whole it is i
i worth-while."
i Mr, Mitchell hails the game as an
outlet for interest and enthusiasm, |
and holds the opinion that it helps!
I the morale of the student body even
I though it is over-emphasized.
Husky, black-haired, physics Pro- j
fessor D. L. Webster opened his re- '
marks with, "Good heavens! I think j
football is the one thing I know the
1 least about; but just because I don't
: go to the games myself I don't be- j
lieve in any strict prohibition against
i them.
"The fact i.s," lie continued, with
troubled expression showing from
behind his Harold Lloyd spectacles, I
I"1 don't know enough about foot-!
, ball to base any opinions."
Used in Experiments
I The physicist says he never pays
anv attention hi athletes in his 1

classes except when he wants to
work an experiment and needs a
"husky" to crank or lift, then he
picks on someone with a big red or
white "S" on his sweater.
"I don't know whether all this
talk about honesty is just rumor or
whether any fraction of it is so," he
said. "During my 13 years here no
one has ever hinted that I give any
more legitimate treatment to foot
ball players on exams. If they get
their subjects that's their business.
I don't even see where tutors would
be illegitimate. It seems to me the
thing we need more than anything
else in connection with football is to
see to it. that conditions are such as
to eliminate talk of paying off ath
letes and of favoritism in scholastic
standing."
Crew Preferred
After reminiscing of his university
days while he gazed at the intricate
scientific instruments about his of
fice and fumbled with the green vi
sor on his desk, the Harvard grad
uate mused, "I went out for crew
instead of football when I was in
college, but they had the games all
right and had lots of fun over them,
too. People used to say I didn't have
the proper appreciation of 'to hell
with Yale',"
Mr. Webster does not think that
football interferes any more with
studies than it did when he went
to school. He i.s aware that it does
interfere some, of course, hut ad
mits that "after all. scholarship
isn't all in life."
A.sked why he didn't attend games
more often, the professor answered
that when he gets a chance to be out
of doors he wants to do something
besides sit still in the bleachers.
"That's getting exercise by proxy,"
I he chuckled.
