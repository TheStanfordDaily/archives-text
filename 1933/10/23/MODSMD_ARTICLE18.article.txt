# CANTORIA CHOIR SINGS TOMORROW
## 
### 
Varying the Tuesday evening lec
jture series, the San Francisco Can
-1 toria, directed by the Reverend Jean
Ribeyron of St. Mary's College, will
I present a concert ui the Memorial
j Church at 7:45 o'clock tomorrow.
The Capella Choir consisting of 37
: mixed voices has made a number
|ol recent appearances followed by
! excellent reports.
To carry out the vogue of the
16th century music of which the
i program mainly consists, the choir
| will be unaccompanied.
Warren D. Allen, University or
| ganist, especially recommends the
program because of its demonstra
tion of the progress of choral music
from its earliest beginnings. Some
lof the numbers to be sung date
j back to the 15th century. Composers
from all parts of Europe will be
1 represented.
