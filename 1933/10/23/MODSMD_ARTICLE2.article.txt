# Hitler's Warning
## 
### 
Before a wildly cheering throng
at Regensburg, Germany, consum
mate showman Hitler reiterated the
Reich's desire to live peaceably but
on equality with the rest of the
world. Well does he realize that the
"Iron Ring" about his nation is
strcnger than in 1914, his neighbors
better armed, far superior to Ger
many in strength. While not threat
ening to re-arm, the Chancellor
warned anxious, waiting Powers
that "a life like that of the last 15
years is intolerable for the German
people."
Having heard their sentiments so
well voiced, tv/o million storm
stoops continued drilling.
