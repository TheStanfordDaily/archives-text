# TUITION MONEY PAYS THIRD OF STUDENT COSTS
## University Defers Large Portion of Expenses Of Education 
### Crompton Bangs, ,Jr 
Standing in line to pay their $114,
puzzled Stanfordites have often
wondered where it goes, what it
does. University receives but $100,
the balance going to the A.S.S.U.
health service; this much is clear
from the registration book; v/nal
happens to the hard-earned hun
dreds is what many would like to
know. How to find out: Read the
President's Report.
Stanford takes in just three mil
lion dollars a year, spends nearly all
of it. Students' tuition and fees ac
count for but a third of this amount,
income from securities and invest
ments for 42 per cent more, gifts to
the University 10 per cent. Smaller
items make up the rest. Of interest
is the fact that dormitories, resi
dences on the campus, and the Stan
ford Hospital produced a net income
of $60,000 last year, about two per
cent.
Where Does It Go?
How the money is spent is what
most want to know. What might be
called "overhead" (maintenance, in
surance, taxes) takes a 15 per cent
slice, all the rest going to instruc
tion, research, and administration.
This 85 per cent slice is divided be
tween administration, general, and
library expense (17 per cent), and
actual teaching and research, 68
per cent. Biggest spender is School
of Social Sciences, getting away with
a round tenth of the University
budget; having about half of all the
Upper Division, it is presumably
biggest income getter.
School of Medicine is not far be
hind, uses another tenth on far
fewer students, charges higher tui
tion to offset this. Engineering, Bi
ology, Physical Sciences, Letters"
spend roughly 7 per cent each; Law
School, teaching attorneys-to-be,
gets by with 3 per cent of the bud
get â€”$86,000. Others get equal or
smaller slices of the now much-di
vided cake. Last year, crumbs worth
$16,000 were left, reserved for ap
propriation.
Should Be Happy
Hard-working Stanford students
thus pay for not more than a third
of the cost of their education, should
feel glad bonds still pay interest,
stocks dividends, that $114 is not
$214 or even $314.
