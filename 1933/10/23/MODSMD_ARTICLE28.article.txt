# Shaw Gained Fame with His 'Arms and the Man'
## 
### JAMES SANDOE 
It was with the first production of
"Arms and the Man," to be pro
duced by the Dramatic Council on
Friday evening, November 3d, that
George Bernard Shaw became a
dramatist to be reckoned with.
Shaw's fourth play, it was the
: first to make a definite inipies
j sion upon the public, although
I critics from the lirst had regarded
| the young Irishman with an in
| terestcd. curiosity..
"Arms and the Man" received its
I first production at the Avenue Thea
tre in London, on April 21, 1894. In
I September of the same year Rich
aid Mansfield produced it at the
| Herald Square Theatre in New
York. Some time later Oscar Straus
| used Shaw's plot as the libretto of
his Constantly revived comic opera,
j "The Chocolate Soldier."
The play itself is light, almost far
cical comedy, with the Shaw satire
directed at the false social ideas
which injure human life, at the false
heroism of the patriot, at family
pretensions,
Hut at the same time, it is happily

free from the tortuous wrangling
over economic and political philoso
phies which make some of his later
plays resemble debates more than
plays.
Like "The Devil's Disciple," and
"Candida," "Arms and the Man"
is close-knit, rapid comedy in
which situation and character are
more important than argumenta
tion.
It burst upon a world used to the
sentimental-pathetic "tragedies" of
the nineteenth century and still
shaking from the onslaught of lb
sen's frank realism. It shocked nol
a few members of those earlier au
diences who had, for centuries, been
taught to regard war as a laudable
and heroic enterprise.
The play has been a favorite ever
since its first production; theatre
groups in countries of the western
wrrld present it constantly. That is
why, in part at least, we are fortu
nate in the campus production, the
liist appearance of a Shaw play in
lull stage production since "Pygma
lion," summer production of 1930.
