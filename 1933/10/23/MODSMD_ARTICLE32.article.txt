# This Thornhill Tale
## 
### 
The pitiful condition of intercollegiate football is very
nicely illustrated by this wild rumor from the Minnesota
plains. Minnesota knows that coaches at Stanford as at
every other major football college come and go on the
tides of victory and defeat (coming on victory and going
(.1) defeat). They knew that Stanford had suffered an upset
ill Chicago. They heard that their own coach was about
lo leave for greener pastures because of Gopher successes.
And so? They put "2" and "2" together; made "22"; and
sent a telegram to Stanford to verify their mathematics.
At present, ThornhilPs position is safe. Stanford alum
ni may he unreasonable at times, may demand continued
victory; but tliev probably would not oust a man for only
a half-defeat, and that clear back at Chicago. If it had
been in Los Angeles, then a different storv, perhaps.
Thornhill has been at Stanford long enough to know
when he can stay, when lie will "accept another offer else
where." He knows that he must win, and especially over
California and I'.S.C.â€”or at least put up a close fight
against the Trojans, slip over a win occasionally. If he
does that, he is safe. The alumni will not complain, the
gate receipts will not decline, all will be happv.
lUiI the shadow of Warner haunts the football field to
ever remind Thornhill of what might happen, what can
happen. Hut that possible day is not yet in sight; is prob
ably farther away than ever with the increased lower
division.
Meanwhile, this rumor will be reprinted in Coast sports
sheets, will be devoured by sportsters on the erroneous as
sumption that even hazy smoke indicates fire. Probable
result: increased ticket sale for the I.S.C. game. Final
result: a happier B.A.C.
