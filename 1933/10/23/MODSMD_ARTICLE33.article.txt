# Finally, the Inevitable

And Roosevelt invited the "Reds"; and tliev accepted;
soon, they will be recognized; and the inevitable will have
been realized. The pressure of the red-phobia that kept
previous administrations tied to an ostrich policy of non
recognition has been ended. Roosevelt has taken the Rus
sian Rear into his arms. "While he will find out that it is
peaceful and innocent, he will, perhaps, also find out
that red-baiting Legionnaires and A. F. ofL. howlers can
scratch plenty.
Through the rosy colored years since the war, three
reasons have been given for non-recognition. First, repu
diation of debts. Second, insidious red propaganda in tlie
I nited States, supposedly financed and directed by in
sidious red leaders in Moscow. Third, instability of the
Soviet regime. Time has proved the futility of each of
these objections the red-phobia in the people remained
;iikl so did non-recognition.
Repudiating debts has become popular. France has
refused to pay. England is talking about ten cents on the
dollar. And South American loans have become a stand
ing joke. Russian repudiation, now some sixteen years
distant, seems less atrocious; never was important enough
to bar recognition.
The fear of red propaganda, constantly nourished by
the Legion, D.A.R., Rettcr American Federations, and other
red, white, and blue organizations, remains as the biggest
bar to the public's acceptance of recognition. The forma
tion of fascist groups in this country (both black and
brown shirts) in fact makes red activity less conspicuous.
The undermining that the reds are said to have been doing
these many years has produced no great collapses, thus
making red-tluimpers like Hamilton Fish look a bit fool
ish. They have cried "wolf, wolf" and there is no wolf. At
least, no red wolf.
The long - promised downfall of the Soviets lias re
mained a long promise. They have stood while others have
fallen. Their stability is reasonably assured, thus removing
that bar to diplomatic recognition.
Meanwhile the desire for a friend at Japan's back and
a market at America's front has made recognition more
certain, more profitable. Roosevelt will lose voles but
America will look less foolish through this recognition.
