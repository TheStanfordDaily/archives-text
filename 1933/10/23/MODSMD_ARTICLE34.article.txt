# The
						Key to the Problem

Under the lockout system, Stanford maidens must
check in at 10:30, 12:00, 2:30 â€” depending primarily on
how long they want to say out.
The Roble sisterhood are greeted at the door by kindly,
though exacting Mrs. Mort. It is her duty to see that no
2:30-ers come home at 2:32 or 5:32. She enforces the
lockout system.
But there are no nine Mrs. Morts for the sororities. On
the How, each woman carries tier own key when she late
leaves. On her honor, each Grecian lassie comes in at the
sacred hour of 10:30, 12:00, 2:30 as the case may be. But
honor is sometimes a very elastic thing; gives some soro
rity women greater freedom than their classmates they
left behind at Roble.
Suggests the Daily that either someone Mort-imize the
sororities or honor-ize Roble. There should be equality.
The Daily staff, as is their custom, will meet promptly
today at 1 : to o'clock. The tryoutees who have been pro
moted to the rank of reporter are congratulated, invited
to the meeting, must attend.
