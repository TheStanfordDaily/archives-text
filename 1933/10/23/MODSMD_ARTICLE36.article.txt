MORNING GLORY (K.K.0.)
At the Stanford and Moiyitain View
Theatres
It is hard to believe that so old a
story as the one about the small
town girl who made good on the
great whiteway could be given such
unique treatment as in this picture,
and thereby result in the impression
that one is seeing something entirely
new. Credit for this feat should be
divided between Lowell Sherman,
the director, and Katherine Hep
burn, his star.
Sherman has utilized every pos
sible opportunity to give the story a
new twist, and he is especially sub
tle in his use of detail —for example,
the conception of the old-fashioned
and sluggish theatre elevator—and
in his handling of minor characters.
In this latter connection, thei'e is the
delightful scene between two ac
tresses when they meet in the man
ager's office:
"My dear! llow simply stun
ning. But I do believe you're
gaining weight!"
"Oh, yes. (Ever so sweetly.) I'll
be in your class soon if I'm not
careful.''
Miss Hepburn offers what is for
her an entirely new piece of work,
and is far far her best performance,
notable chiefly for remarkable con
sistency where inconsistency might
seem unavoidable. Her voice seems
somewhat different than previously,
and yet remains singularly impres
sive. She portrays a girl from a
small New England town who takes
as a stage name "Eva Lovelace," and
who comes to New York armed with
endless effrontery and a letter from
Bernard Shaw "which has never left
her a moment since she received it."
The absolute naivete of Miss Hep
burn's work is almost incredible at
times, and it is at all times perfectly
maintained.
Like many a well-behaved film
story, the current narrative serves
simply as a, vehicle for the star
(and director), and as such does not
bear too close scrutiny. The vicissi

ludes of Eva Lovelace are amus- ;
ingly, if raggedly, told, and the ac- j
cepted ending is reached fairly pain- j
lessly; and thus it is needless to j
cavil at the Romeo and Juliet se- i
querice and certain other superflui- |
ties.
Less happy in his handling of male j
characters than the Mae Wests and 1
Hepburns (just as though there were
more than one of either!), Sherman
permits Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., arjd j
Adolphe Menjou to appear fairly i
stupid most, of the time and gives
Fairbanks a nasty overdose of hero- j
ism.
I. never was one to point out the
"best shot" of a picture, but I can
not resist urging you to watch for
the fleeting scene in which Hep
burn, as assistant in a fourth-rate
jugglers' act, acts "charming"' for j
her public. —Chapin |
THE SUMMER SEASON: IV—
The Symphony
In a depression summer marked
by musical failures throughout the 1
country, the symphony season at the
Woodland Theatre in Hillsborough;
was a complete and enthusiastic sue- ;
cess. The four concerts were at- |
tended by large and brilliant audi
ences, and artistically the programs '
were well designed and executed.
Variety was the keynote of the '
series. The principal novelty was
t he appearance as guest conductor ;
of Dr. Howard Hanson, director of I
the Eastman School of Music and
formerly dean of the music depart
ment of the College of the Pacific. ,
His program consisted chiefly of 1
contemporary American music, and J
featured his own Symphony No. 2, !
the "Romantic." This concert occa
sioned much discussion as to Amer- j
ica's place in the musical firmament, j
The season opened with a very
popular program directed by Rich
aid Lert, husband of Vicki Baum, !
the novelist. He featured his own 1
native Viennese music.
The last two concerts were in the
capable hands of Ossip Gabrilo-
