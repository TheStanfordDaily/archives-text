"ROOTERS WORSE THAN
LEGIONNAIRES?"
1 The Editor, Sir:
In an article or editorial appear
ing earlier this week credit (or
j blame) is given Governor Rolph for
the .state sales tax. If you would
i demand lhat your writers first do a
i little reading, they would know that
Rolph opposed the tax and favored
: the appropriation of the surplus
I gasoline tax mon.ey. The people of
! California authorized the sales tax
' at the last polls.
And where does the Daily get its
figures on the "criminal, drunken,
property-damaging American Le
[ gion?" The "criminal" is so obvi
i ously- stupid that it needs no com
! ment. As for drunkeness and prop
| erty-damage—well, hotel owners
j fight for them. And the 125,000 vet-
I cians now in Chicago for a week
i will have a hard time equaling the
| record set by the thousand Stanford
; rooters at the U.S.C. game in 1927
lor 1923. The night before the game
j and the night after these worthies
I did around $20,000 damage to the
| Hclel Biltmore alone.
Sincerely yours,
