# FROSH GRID TEAM LOSES TO MENLO IN 12-8 STRUGGLE
## 
### 
Finding injuries, over-confidence, j
and an unexpectedly powerful Men- j
lo team too strong a combination, |
the Stanford freshman grid team j
bowed to the neighboring J.C. eleven j
last Saturday by a 12 to 8 score.
Consistently outplaying the Blue j
and White visitors during most of I
the game, the Babes were unable to |
push over a touchdown until the j
last few minutes of play after their j
opponents had already sewed up the j
. contest.
Early in the first quarter Stanford j
blocked two Menlo punts within a
lew seconds of each other with the
la.st one rolling back of the end zone
fc-r a safety and two points for the
1 ndians.
Lcdbcttcr Gains
Although Ledbetter and other.
Stanford backs ran up a consider
able amount of yardage, while Men
lo passed down to the Indian 15-
yard line and tried an unsuccessful
drop kick, neither team could score
until well into the third quarter.
Then Menlo made two 15-yard pen- i
cities, an interception in midfield,
and a long forward pass result in a
touchdown for their team.
A few minutes later one of
Russ Sweet's hard-driving gridmen
crashed into the Stanford backfield,
grabbed the ball as the Indian backs
attempted a reverse, and streaked
for a second touchdown. The place j
kick was wide.
Babes Score
In the last' part of the final quar- |
ter, Coach Bradshaw's charges cut j
loose with a passing attack that re- ;
suited in a touchdown, only to be j
called back because an intended lat- j
eral was ruled a forward pass. Un- j
daunted, the Babes came back on !
the next play, tried another for- j
ward-lateral and scored, again, this j
time lor good. Brent was the third i
man in the passing chain, carrying
the ball over for the touchdown. The I
conversion failed.
Another desperate pass almost re- i
suited in a score, barely slipping I
through the receiver's fingers, as the j
game ended at the 12-S count.
