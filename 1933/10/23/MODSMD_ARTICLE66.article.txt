# CONCERT SOLOISTS' CARTOONS SECURED
## 
### 
Large-size caricatures of the five
prominent artists who are to be
presented this season on the Stan
ford Concert Series have been com
missioned from Antonio Sotomayor,
young Bolivian artist, and will be
on display next week at the Engi
neering corner.
Sotomayor, now a resident of San
Francisco, recently held a one-man
| show of caricatures at the Courvoi
| sier Galleries. He specializes in
i satirizing political leaders, and only
; recently has turned to leading faces
j of the music world.
; He works in pastels, and his cari
i catures are notably more amicable
â–  than malicious. Although they show
j "ti keen grasp of character" and
' through suppression of detail are
i able to "simmer a person down to
j v symbol," Sotomayor prefers to
j consider them his hobby, which, he
! explains, he follows "with the en
| thusiasm of a collector."
