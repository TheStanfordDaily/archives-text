Hello Frosh!
here's real news for you!
© You're away from home for the first time and the folks you
left at home will probably miss you a great deal. They'll want to
hear from you—to know what's going on around the campus —to
know the inside dope on what the Indians are doing—to know
just hundreds of things about the various campus activities.
9 What are you going to do—struggle laboriously and write
boring letters in an effort to keep your friends posted on Stanford
happenings? No. Here's a better plan! For just $4.00 you can
have the Stanford Daily mailed to any address for the whole school
year. The Daily "covers" campus affairs as only a student paper
can cover them. Wouldn't it be worth that to you to be relieved
of the responsibility of letter writing? It would surely be worth
much more than that to the folks back home.
$ Just clip the coupon below and mail it or leave it at the Daily
office. Oh, yes, here's more good news! If you've already made
too many checks "payable to Stanford University" or if you want
to save the two-cent check tax, just check the lower square and
we'll send a bill along with the paper. Better clip it now so you'll
not miss the first issue.
