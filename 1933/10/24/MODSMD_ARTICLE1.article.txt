## Tottering Daladier 
### 
In Paris Premier Daladier's cabi
net enjoyed (?) another day of
grace, feared the tune when a vote
in the Chamber must come on the
budget-balancing, anti-inflation pro
gram. Precarious is the position of
the present government which must
balance the budget and cut salaries
â€”both anathema to the French. If
this is not done, the inevitable al
ternatives are inflation and aband
onment of the gold standard, even
more distasteful to thrifty French
bourgeoisie.
Meanwhile the franc teetered on
its gold perch, crowds rioted in Pa
ris, barricaded streets. Much-trou
bled Daladier pondered the cruel
dilemna which the working of
Fiench politics had thrust upon him.
