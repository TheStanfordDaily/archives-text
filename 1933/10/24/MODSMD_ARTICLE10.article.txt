### Rolph Malloch 
Some light on the confusing pic
ture of modern Germany is cast by
the reports of Ben Barber, '34, who
leturned to Stanford this quarter
after spending 13 months in the
chaotic Rhineland.
Intelligent, observing, Barber had
seen much while attending the Uni
versity of Munich. On his week
ends he traveled throughout Ger
many, watched the political up
heavals of the Nazi struggle for
power.
Barber pointed out that the pres
ent German government may be
termed a prolonged state of martial
law. He says, "Under the iron rule
of the Nazi government many re
gretable, reactionary events have
occurred.
"Post-war Germany was faced
with the task of rebuilding a
crushed.and exhausted nation in the
face of every opposition her ene
mies could invent. The government
of the Republic, being a compromise
of 17 political parties, was weak, in
efficient and corrupt to. a notorious
extent.
"It was not hard for Hitler's or
ganized minority to gain control.
Hitler is a mob-psychologist of
great ability, and his fanatical fol
lowers worship him as their
"Shepherd." One likes or hates
Hitler; one cannot be indifferent
to him. He carries out his poli
cies with a brutality that has
shocked the world. A softer man
would have failed. He rules only n
because no opposition can be or
ganized against him.
"Hitler saved Germany from a
bloody revolution, temporarily, but
another Great War would mean the
spread of Communism to the French
and Italian borders. I dread seeing
the United States once more trying
to make the world safe for de
mocracy."
