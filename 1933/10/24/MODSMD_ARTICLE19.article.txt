# STANFORD GRID STRENGTH GAINS FOR HUSKY TILT
## Bob Hamilton Cuts Loose In First Hard Work Since Injury 
### Spud Hamilton 
With excellent possibilities of
being at full strength for the Wash
ington game, the Cardinals yester
day underwent the first of what
promises to be three days of rough,
tugged, rampant scrimmage.
All were present and accounted
for, with the exception of Bobby
Grayson, who lies in the hospital
with an injured leg. Rangy Bob
Reynolds is also suffering an in
jured knee, but he appeared and
took a light practice. Boh Hamil
ton was running signals without
restraint for the first time since ;
his jaw injury, and Ben Pala
mountain was in a suit, capering
around with some difficulty.
A good rip-roaring scrimmage was
the piece de resistance, but the
squad indulged in a moderate
amount of vicious blocking as an
appetizer. Ends Norgard, Moscrip, 1
Smith, Trompas, Packard, and Top
ping survived an unpleasant session
as live game for the blocking backs. !
"Average" Team
Washington will present a team
that can be called little more than
"average." Expected before the sea
son opened to be one of the leading
contenders for the conference title
this year, they came along splen- -
didly until a 6-0 setback by the Ore
gon Webfeet checked their drive.
Last week they had difficulty pound
ing out a victory from little College ■
of Puget Sound.
Stanford will be eager to com
plete the accounts for that 18 to 13
licking the Huskies handed them in
Stanford stadium last season. Thorn
hill rightly figures if he can dispose
of the gentlemen from the North
west —well, all will be clear sailing,
if you can figure El Trojan is clear
sailing.
Good Reserves
What is good to look at in this
Stanford team of 1933, is the well
stocked supply of reserves. At every
position Thornhill can boast of at
least one capable substitute, and at
some places the material is almost
too plentiful. For instance, the full
back berth, where a man with the
ability of Frank Alustiza was forced
to languish on the bench for a full
game Saturday.
About the most pleasing aspect of
j that San Francisco game was the
| ;ippearance of Guards Rouble and
! Adams, who have been rusting on
i the sidelines since the San Jose trial.
When they moved into the lines to
replace the fading Corbus and
O'Connor, a new life was injected in
the Indians. It was like giving a
worn man a shot of dope.
