# No Riots Mark Exodus of Axe From P.A. Bank
## 
### 
Without a body guard, Jerry
Trautman strode into the Amer
ican Trust Company Bank in
Palo Alto last week. Purpose:
To get Stanford's famed axe.
Walking in broad daylight
down University avenue, axe in
hand, Trautman attracted a
handful of interested citizens
who gingerly examined it. Later
he put it in his car, drove to the
campus, had the traditional
blade taken to the engravers in
San Francisco to be mounted on
the plaque.
Old timers remember the
spring evening in 1930 when the
axe was rushed to the B.A.C.
safe in morbid fear that 2,000
hysterical Stanford men would
not be able to guard it from an
avenging California horde.
Reason for today's lack of
precaution in loting the axe: an
agreement signed with Califor
nia guaranteeing the safety of
the axe as a Big Game trophy.
