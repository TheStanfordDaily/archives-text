# Present Sales Tax Unsound, Fagan Believes
## Expert Brands Theory And Economic Effect 
### 
Expert opinion, aligning itself with
the general feeling of annoyance,
brands the present California sales
tax as "unsound in theoi-y, and un
economical in effect," according to
Stanford's public finance expert, El
mer Fagan.
California's most recent preoccu
pation, that of hunting pennies for
Jimmy, is all a snare and a delusion,
considering that a revenue tax
should have bearing on the individ
ual's ability to pay. Disapproving,
Fagan pointed out that the salps tax
fells alike on rich and poor.
Branding as false the theory that
a state income ,tax would drive out
industry from the state, Fagan went
on to explain that the repressive ef
fects of the sales tax on industry
are more than those of a graded in
come tax. "A graded income tax
affects incomes proportionately," he
said.
Although the decision of the Cali
fornia Legislature will have to
stand, Fagan believes that the state
should "at least try" a personal in
come tax before jumping to the con
clusion that it wouldn't work.
