# ALMON E. ROTH FACES SERIOUS CO-OP PROBLEM
## Fraternity-Hall Purchasing Network Is Great Source of Worry PLAN IS IN FIFTH YEAR Disappointed Bidders Seek To Oust System 
### 
Bothered, figure-ridden Comptrol
ler Roth gets more worked up over
Ihe fraternity co-op buying service
than most things. The co-op is Uni
versity-financed, st u den t - suggest e d
and directed, but the Comptroller
gets most of the kick-backs.
Five years ago a worried house
manager tired of battling greedy,
combining Paly merchants came to
the budget-master. After months of
meetings the Students' Co-operative
Association was actually launched.
The co-op, combined the individ
ual purchasing powers of 24 frater
nities, the sororities, clubs, and din
ing halls. Each organization was
given a vote in the Board of Con
trol, voted for four student repre
sentatives on the Board of Directors,
two alumni representatives.
Manager Appointed
To the managership and the board,
the Comptroller, safeguarding the
University funds, appointed a man
ager. Direct control lay with the
Board of Directors and the manager,
indirect' with the organization rep
resentatives, the Comptroller.
Provided rent-free quarters in
Branner, safe-guarded with five
year contracts with member-or
ganization, the co-op got oIT to a
fair start. Now in its first year, it
still goes fairly. Rut troubles are
frequent, seas still stormy. Reason
says the Comptroller: Disap
pointed bidders appeal to house
managers, swear they've been un
done, quote glowingly prices they
would not give.
Worse trouble: one year men,
house managers are unacquainted
with co-op benefits, do not remem
ber the "Did laissez faire days, at
tempt to avoid contracts, sabotage
the scheme, or are indifferent to the
management and their responsibil
ity, complain. All in all, things are
not rosy for the man who has to
keep explaining, the Comptroller.
Charges Necessary
While co-op handling charges are
moderate, charges there must be.
Invested there aro $4,000 fixed as
sets, necessary is working capital of
some $10,000 to carry over between
the first and tenth of each month,
supply capital on hand for stock on
hand. Sales during a year approxi
mates $100,000, sales expense $10,-
000. These include a manager at
$2,250 a year and three other men.
Excellent, says the Comptroller, is
the long-term effect of the co-op. It
is economical and efficient. Without
it the total costs of fraternity-etc.
foods would be far higher. But co-op
without co-operation is no go. If
the co-op is to continue after tbi.;,
the contract-expiring year, there
must be active, understanding par
ticipation by enough student organi
zations. Alternative: a return 1o the
anarchy of five years ago; higher
costs for fratrnities, sororities, and
clubs.

Bothered, figure-ridden Comptrol

gets most of the kick-backs.
Five years ago a worried house
manager tired of battling greedy,
combining Paly merchants came to
the budget-master. After months of
meetings the Students' Co-operative
Association was actually launched.
The co-op, combined the individ
ual purchasing powers of 24 frater
nities, the sororities, clubs, and din
ing halls. Each organization was
given a vote in the Board of Con
trol, voted for four student repre
sentatives on the Board of Directors,
two alumni representatives.
Manager Appointed
To the managership and the board,
the Comptroller, safeguarding the
University funds, appointed a man
ager. Direct control lay with the
Board of Directors and the manager,
indirect' with the organization rep
resentatives, the Comptroller.
Provided rent-free quarters in
Branner, safe-guarded with five
year contracts with member-or
ganization, the co-op got oIT to a
fair start. Now in its first year, it
still goes fairly. Rut troubles are
frequent, seas still stormy. Reason
says the Comptroller: Disap
pointed bidders appeal to house
managers, swear they've been un
done, quote glowingly prices they
would not give.
Worse trouble: one year men,
house managers are unacquainted
with co-op benefits, do not remem
ber the "Did laissez faire days, at
tempt to avoid contracts, sabotage
the scheme, or are indifferent to the
management and their responsibil
ity, complain. All in all, things are
not rosy for the man who has to
keep explaining, the Comptroller.
Charges Necessary
While co-op handling charges are
moderate, charges there must be.
Invested there aro $4,000 fixed as
sets, necessary is working capital of
some $10,000 to carry over between
the first and tenth of each month,
supply capital on hand for stock on
hand. Sales during a year approxi
mates $100,000, sales expense $10,-
000. These include a manager at
$2,250 a year and three other men.
Excellent, says the Comptroller, is
the long-term effect of the co-op. It
