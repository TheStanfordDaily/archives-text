Now we know why Stanford has sonic clever baekfield
men on its football team they get their practice making
nocturnal excursions along the paths between Encina and
the library.
As blocked by obstacles us the path to a touchdown, the
paths and by-ways offer wonderful practical experience
lo the man who would win his spurs as a tricky halfback,
;i scintillating lad who can cut sharply inside the tackle,
swerve by a defensive backticldcr, and run, first to the
right and then lo the left, to a touchdown.
Hut every once in a while one of these touchdown
bound gentlemen gets tripped, falls on his neck, breaks his
contract and his shoulder at one and the same time. And
that's the point, dear reader, of this squib.
For the price of two quarters' tuition of. one student,
the I'nivcrsilv could eliminate a lot of hazards and throw
a little light on what at this moment is a dark subject
trekking over those paths after dark.
Even if the inmates of Encina, Toyon, and Branner
choose to stroll home along the "paved" streets, they take
(heir lives in their hands, or on their feet. The road sur
faces are so rough, "pieaicd" \vith so many rolls of asphalt
and marred by holes of various sizes that it is a trick to
venture on them during the rainy spell.
The installation of a pole or two, with a couple of
strong lights and reflectors, would eliminate the possibili
ties of severe injuries which might force a student to leave
school. The electricity would cost little, the powerhouse
being a Stanford-owned plant.
That's the story. How about some light on the subject?
