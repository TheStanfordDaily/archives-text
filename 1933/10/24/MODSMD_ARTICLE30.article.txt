# The 						Band South?
## 
### 
One of Ihe biggest open questions on the Campus these
warm mornings -especially to 100 band members —is
whether the 100 band members will be sent south for the
Trojan battle. A trip is the big pay-off in every extra
curricular activity from varsity football to freshman de
bating. The fond hopes of the band members are justified
hopes.
The only itch in their blankets: where is the money?
Obviously, the money must come from some place. The
geographical interrogation, "where," is the annoying prob
lem.
Several suggestions have been made. The first, the As
sociated Students. They are trying hard, probably too
hard, to meet this big item. Sending the band south is a
tremendous item to meet with so many campus activities
crying for support, with so many more probably crying for
support before the year is over.
The second suggestion, always a suggestion in matters
monetary, is the Board of Athletic Control. They are the
logical ones to meet this expense. Logical, because a better
display in the south means greater gate receipts. City yo
kels, like their country brothers, always appreciate a band,
two bands even better. The Trojan encounter is more vital
to the B.A.C. than to the students; they should pay.
But, all is not dollars and cents with the Board. They
have their financial problems, may not be able to meet the
band trip outlay.
It' the Board cannot, the alumni should. The southern
alumni should raise the money for the trip. They will swell
with pride, clap with joy as "Conic Join the Band" sounds
through the much-named southern stadium (Coliseum,
(Mvmpic, Memorial).
But, briefly, the Band cannot look to the Associated
Students for funds: first, there is little to look to financially
oil that front. Second, it is more properly a 8.A.C,. or
alumni enterprise though students do play in the band. If
the band does not go south, it will be no stain on the Uni
versity, so deep and everlasting that the A.S.S.U. should
pay for it.
