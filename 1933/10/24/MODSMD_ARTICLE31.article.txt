A person who attempts to analyze the student mind
what the undergraduate thinks and why he thinks it—is
pretty sure to have Alice's reaction: "(luriouser and euri
ouser."
For example, practically every college student thinks
Mint he and the other students are advanced in liberalism,
completely independent in thought, and almost radical in
political and philosophical outlook. At the same time most
of the students look upon the professors as stuffy old con
servatives. unchanging decade after decade, unswerving
from tradition and precedent.
As a matter of fact a careful survey would probably
show that the opposite is true. At Stanford particularly the
students tend to he conservative, almost reactionary. The
professors, on the other hand, are largely disciples of lib
eralism and free thought.
This isn't so surprising when it is considered that most
Stanford students come from solid, respectable, upper
middle-class families: the personification of respectability
and staunch supporters of tlie social order, to whom ehan
and staunch supporters of the social order, to whom
change of any sort is viewed with suspicion.
The professors generally are acquainted with so many
different creeds and dogmas that they are not prone to
become enthused over any one particular social order.
Professors, being professors, are not so highly paid as to
consider it necessary to bolster up capitalism.
Thus we have the curious situation of supposedly radi
cal students who frown upon Hoosevelt as too liberal, and
in contrast the theoretically conservative faculty which
joyfully embraces socialism, communism, and perhaps
even atheism.
