# BULL SESSION
## ON THE WORLD EXCHANGE: "PEACE, PREFERRED" 
### 
Every time an international con
vention adjourns without having
accomplished anything (which is
quite often), loud are the horse
laughs, prolonged and distended are
the sneers. Jeering, paradoxically
joyful, comment runs all the way
from the solemn editorial standby:
"The convention was doomed to
failure" to the salty savings from
the sagebrush pen of Will Rogers.
Everyone says he wants peace.
Yel through all of this organized
Bronx cheering, the only concrete
suggestion that emerges is that of
Mi-. Hearst. This gentleman urges
every upstanding American, worthy
of the name, to cease all intercourse
with the sinful states across the
waters. He requests the American
turtle to pull in its neck entirely—
providing only that Canadian news
paper pulp may sneak through to
feed a thousand saffron presses.
Hearst wants one exception. Thou
sands want thousands more. So the
scheme does not work.
If we seriously desire peace, what
better way is there to promote it
than by international conclave? A
Geneva Conference may eat up sev
; oral millions of dollars. Several
hundred bombs eat up not only the
' millions of dollars, but also the city
I of Geneva.
Cigar smoke, perspiration, round
table: these are things easily under
stood by Americans and all the vest.

! It is no argument to argue that the
most sizeable result thus far of dip
lomatic pomp and cigarettes, is more
pomp, more cigarettes, a short of
sherry, and adjournment.
The .struggle for peace (if there is
such a thing) must be carried on
with the same systematic tenacity
that has characterized war and busi
ness these many years. When the
drive on Shanghai tailed, the Rising
Sun shone over Manchuria. When
the offensive on capitalist European
markets fails, America welcomes in
to her arms the once "gory," now
j '"grinning" Soviet Bear.
Peace is not a poet's dream;
though world-wide dreaminess has
j characterized much of our effort in
that direction. Feace is a definite
objective, and must be regarded as
| such. The cessation of slaughter,
the end of organized hatred, the ad
vance of civilized pursuits: these are
! some of the things which peace rep
i resents. An idealistic vision of green
! grass, pastoral pleasantness, and
shepherd simpleness —are not only
futile, but somewhat ludicrous.
Idealism must be harnessed!
j If peace, in its better sense, is
ever to have a fighting chance for
| life—conference, convention, round
table will get it. The Fuller Brush
man, too, must invade the realm of
j international policy. Peace must be
contracted for, organized into edu
| cational districts, ballyhooed, and
propagandized. It will not "just
| grow!" —Dave Mellinkoff
