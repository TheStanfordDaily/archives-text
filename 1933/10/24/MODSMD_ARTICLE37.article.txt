THE MOULTING ANGEL (Welles)
At the Palo Alto Community Theatre
The Moulting Angel, three-act do
mestic comedy, was successfully
presented to an enthusiastic audi
ence Friday night. All of the play's
success rested on the shoulders of
Ralph Welles in the triple-threat
role of author, director, and actor.
As Jimmy Wayne, the gangling
coliege freshman, erstwhile salesman
of peanuts for pachydermatic con
sumption, embryo newspaper col
umnist, and budding theatrical fi
nancier, he kept the audience laugh
ing every moment he was on the
stage. Joe La wry was more comic, |
but less consistently funny, in the
character part of Wendell Wood. Ja
net Large, bearing the difficult dra
matic burden of the piece, has a'
voice much like Katharine Hepburn,
but she often uses it to such effect
that she sound insincere.
The play, although not a great lit
erary opus, gets across well. It has
some slow moments and a few awk
ward ones, but it also has many
clever lines, good comedy situations,
and several surefire scenes.
Jerry Wayne, unemployed actress,
by the blunderingly helpful maneu
vers of her brother Jimmy, is forced
into the position of marrying grumpy
old Wendell Wood as a gesture of
thanks for his resuscitation of the
family fortunes. Happily, Wendell '
Wood, well-hooked, has already |
I married Jimmy's little blonde friend,
