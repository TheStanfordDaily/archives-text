# Orations, Spilled Milk
## 
### 
The expected national farm strike j
passed almost unnoticed yesterday.
Although irate, picketing lowa j
farmers spiffed milk on its way to
market and orated mightily, many
more did not even know that the
widely-heralded strike had started.
Cattle, wheat, milk continued to
move to market in undiminished
quantities.
Fearing rain, California's cotton ,
growers have become more trac- j
table, have asked for federal aid. j
State officials, confronted with a j
dilernna, have obligingly passed the i
buck. Their recommendation to \
"rich" Uncle Sam: 60 cents per 100 j
pounds for pickers, federal relief !
fund to contribute 20 cents; total, j
80 cents, meeting embattled strikers' ]
demands half-way.
