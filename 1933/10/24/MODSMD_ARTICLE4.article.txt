# Tariff Trader

Russian recognition preliminaries
well-launched, Secretary Hull, leav
ing actual hands-across-sea discus
sion to Soviet-wise assistants, Moore
and Bullitt, is off for the South
American races. In Montevideo, Uru
guay, the Pan-American Conference
meets next December. During No
vember the trade-conscious secre
tary will "good-will" tour the West
Coast Latin lands, lay the founda
tions for final bargaining at the con
ference, finish off the bilatei'al tar
itr treaties U. S. is now negotiating
with every South American power.
His avowed purpose is to build a
preference empire similar to Brit
ain's, linking U.S. with Southern,
Latin neighbors, bringing the dollar
back to foreign-trade. To be feared:
amiable tariff-traders Hull and Roo
sevelt will alienate the British by
stealing their pet Argentine market,
lose Britain's aid for disarmament,
economic co-operation, general
world policy.
