Ir seems to be an old American
custom that when anyone gets to
the top and gives every indication
oi .sticking around thai place for a
good long while, he gets severe ap
plications of the Bronx cheer. So
now we find El Trojan and the es
timable Howard Jones on the spot
for no other reason than that they
mind their own business, do what
they darn please, and succeed in
doing it.
Howard Jones and the Southern
California authorities are undergo
ing severe criticism because they
have indicated that they do not care
to schedule a contest with a cer
tain Northern California team next
year.
If one reads the public prints one
learns that Jones is a scurrilous,
ch ie ken- hearted, dirty - dealing,
grouchy old back biter, and that
everything that applies to him in
dividually goes double for U.S.C.
collectively. He is so encrusted with
demonical disdain for the public that
he will prevent 80,000 citizens from
enjoying a football classic next year.
Not only that, but he cuts his own
nose off to spite his face by turning
down the gate receipts that the 80,-
000 would bring to the S.C. strong
box. Thus, he is actually disloyal to
the very institution that signs his
pay-check.
Does anyone concede the obvious
pomt that Howard Jones and his
stall know their own business? No.
Why can't U.S.C., which has played
this Northern team once, and were
haggled by public demand into play
ing them again, be allowed to holler
"Quits" and go on about their busi
ness. Their business consists of
meeting 011 the football field, repre
sentative teams from schools of es
tablished standing, teams with back
grounds of scholarship, intelligence,
character, and sportsmanship.
If Southern California has achieved
such prestige in the athletic world
that they may choose their oppon
ents with some discrimination, it is!
their right to exercise that privilege,
and no amount of public hullabaloo j
should cause them to change their
minds. If Howard Jones does not j
care to risk the bodies and the char- I
acter of his men against a team
which he may consider to be a ;
bunch of "toughs"; and the reputa
tion of his school against a preju
diced rabble of rooters and too- j
enthusiastic supporters who are
ready to cry "Cheater," "Crooked," j
"Diity" and other less euphonious
names, it is not only his privilege 1
but it is his duty.

U.S.C. is a big box office attrac- 1
lion in its own right. Down there'
they don't worry for lack of suit
able opponents—they have plenty on
the waiting list, and the loss of 80,-
000 prospective ticket purchasers
does not worry the management.
Other schools are not so fortu
nate to count the sheckles with a
wary eye; we believe California, St.
Mary's, U.S.F., U.C.LA. are in this
class. Look at Santa Clara's sched
ule; do you think they could afford
to give up an annual meeting with
the "best box office attraction in the
bay region?"

Stanford herself is on the verge of
plunging in to grab some of these
lucrative games, wilh the consequent
ri.sk that these "box office teams"
always bring. It is a situation to be
ck-plored, but it is one which seems
inevitable, if the B.A.C. continues to
carry its financial burdens. All we
can hope is for the speedy arrival of
better days, when Stanford can
choose their opponents as U.S.C.
does now. —Hamilton
