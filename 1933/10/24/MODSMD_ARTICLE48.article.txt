# BEEDLE ELECTED TO CAPTAINCY OF FROSH GRID TEAM
## 
### Charles Chappell 
Relieving the gloomy hangover
from Saturday's unexpected defeat,
the freshman grid team took time
out last night to elect Dale Beedle,
star left tackle, as IJM3 captain.
Hailing from Miami, Arizona, Bee
dle has distinguished himself
this year in the frosh line, having
turned in one of the hest games
in freshman tackle history against
S.C.
Becdle, injured in the Menlo game
Saturday, received the honor in ab
sentee fashion since he was unable
to turn out for practice last night.
A pretty badly gashed leg kept him
I away although it is "not expected to
prove very serious.
Vigna Still Out
Vigna, first-string halfback, was
Lstill laid up with the injury that
kept out of Saturday's game, while
i Chouteau, right end, took the after
noon off to have a troublesome foot
X-rayed. How serious the collec
tion of injuries will prove is not
known.
I Next Saturday the freshmen will
| run into no stiffer opposition than
! that offered by the San Jose State
I frosh. The following week, how
j ever, they will meet the Santa Clara
1 freshmen, a rough, ready, and capa
i ble bunch of gridders who are
i primed to give the Stanford Babes
I a busy afternoon of it.
Injuries and disgust at Saturday's
1 showing against Menlo combined to
j make Coach Bradshaw try out a new
| first - string combination at last
night's session. Schott held down
j his regular end job while, Jim Rey
| nolds took the absent Chouteau's
place at Ihe right wing.
Few Changes
Tsoutsouvas and Williamson took
care of the tackle positions while
Spinetti and Hurley worked at the
j guard posts. Quails, who has been
alternating with Bergman at the
pivot job, played at center.
There was little change in the
; backfield where Jack Rolls took the
injured Vigna's place with Wil
liams, Turretto, and Ledbetter com
pleting the quartet. Williams and
Ledbetter are practically recovered
from injuries that have handicapped
them for the past week.
