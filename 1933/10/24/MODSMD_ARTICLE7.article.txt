### Will Williams 
Varying the schedule of the

cal program by the San Francisco
Cautoria will be given instead of
the usual lecture. The concert is
to consist of sacred and secular
pieces, will be given at 7:45 o'clock
in the Memorial Church.
Directed by Jean Ribeyron of St.
Mary's, the Cantoria, an "a" capella
choir of 37 voices, has been described
as "remarkable for its organ-like
polyphonic quality." For its pro
grams, the Cantoria draws exclu
sively upon the repertories of the
"Sistine Chapel" of Rome and the
"Chanteurs de Saint GervaLs," of
Paris.
Allen Lauds Group
Warren D. Allen, University or
ganist, commends highly the edu
cational value of this choral group,
reminiscent of those of Rome and
Ukraine. "It is notable," Allen de
clared, "that the program begins
with a work of the earliest poly
phonic music, dating back to the
fifteenth century, a work entitled,
'O Salutaris Hostia,' by an old Flem
ish composer, Pierre de La Rue."
The balance of the program is
made up from various polyphonic
schools of the sixteenth century
European music. A motet by van
Berchem represents the Dutch
school, the mysticism of the Span
ish school is expressed in the two
famous motets of Victoria, the "O
Vos Amnes," written for Holy
Week, and "O Magnum Mysterium,"
written for the Nativity.
Palestrina, the greatest composer
oi the Roman school, is included in
the program with three selections,
one of which is a secular madrigal.
William Byrd, of the English School,
is the composer of "Ave Verum Cor
pus," and "Lullaby, My Sweet Little
Baby."
There are three old French com
positions, and later developments
are recognized in the final number
on the program, the joyous chorus,
"Freue Dich, Erloeste Schaar," by
Jchann Sebastian Bach. "An in
teresting program, from a musical
as well as historical viewpoint," ac
cording to Warren D. Allen.
Sponsored by the Committee on
Public Exercises, the concert is given
to stimulate interest in the art of
polyphonic style and the best in mu
sical literature.

Directed by Jean Ribeyron of St.
Mary's, the Cantoria, an "a" capella
choir of 37 voices, has been described
as "remarkable for its organ-like
polyphonic quality." For its pro
grams, the Cantoria draws exclu
sively upon the repertories of the
"Sistine Chapel" of Rome and the
"Chanteurs de Saint GervaLs," of
Paris.
Allen Lauds Group
Warren D. Allen, University or
ganist, commends highly the edu
cational value of this choral group,
reminiscent of those of Rome and
Ukraine. "It is notable," Allen de
clared, "that the program begins
with a work of the earliest poly
phonic music, dating back to the
fifteenth century, a work entitled,
'O Salutaris Hostia,' by an old Flem
ish composer, Pierre de La Rue."
The balance of the program is
made up from various polyphonic
schools of the sixteenth century
European music. A motet by van
Berchem represents the Dutch
school, the mysticism of the Span
ish school is expressed in the two
famous motets of Victoria, the "O
Vos Amnes," written for Holy
Week, and "O Magnum Mysterium,"
written for the Nativity.
