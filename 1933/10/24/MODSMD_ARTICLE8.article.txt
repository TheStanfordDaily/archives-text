# Internationalists to Hold Open Bull Session Today
## 
### 
The International Relations Club
is holding a bull session on pur
poses and plans this afternoon at 4
o'clock in Room 22 on Quad, and
President Crompton Bangs invites
all interested Stanfordites
On November 8-9, all clubs in
Northern California and Nevada—
some 15 in number—will meet on
the Stanford campus, discuss Hitler
ism and other world problems, dine,
be addressed by foreign notables,
then go home until next year. .
A feature of the club is that it is
due-less, as the Carnegie Founda
tion supports both it and its library
of current political and economic
works.
