# Choir Recital Wins Plaudits
## 
### 
Remarkable for its organ-like
quality and the perfect blending of
voices, was the recital of polyphonic
music given by the San Francisco
1 Cantoria Choir last night.
Particularly well-done and effec
tive was the solemn, very reflective
O Vos Omnes, a composition of the
Spanish school, written â–  by Tomas-
Luis de Victoria.
The Choir, composed of 37 singers,
easily two-thirds of whom were
feminine, appeared in vestments;
was led by Rev. Jean Ribeyron of
St. Mary's. The 11 male voices lent
a strength and solidity to what
would otherwise have been mere
melodiousness.
Mostly faculty members and ofT
campus visitors, the audience filled
all the pews in the too-brightly lit
Memorial Church, left well-satisfied,
complimenting the work of the
Choir.
