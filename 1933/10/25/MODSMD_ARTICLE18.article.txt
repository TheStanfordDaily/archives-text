# Stanford Grad Coaches At Santa Barbara School
## 
### 
Blond, curly-haired Sheridan Hog
land, one-time Daily night editor i
and poker player, and last year an I
M.A. in Economics, is now coach of j
the Santa Barbara Junior High
School football team.
Daily the Stanford scholar bawls j
out football plays to a shabby, re- '
caltitrant group of 12 and 13-year- i
old future all-Americans. Two wins
and a tie have rewarded his efforts
thus far.
