Editor's Note: This is the last of a series of three articles giving reac
tions of Stanford educators to modern-day football..

And now the historian looks at
i
football! Presenting Edward Hulme,
serious-minded history professor, on
the subject of the undergraduate's
favorite sport!
"Students don't come to college to
devote their entire time to college
work—at least they shouldn't," said
he, dogmatically.
It is his opinion that during col
lege years students should lead a
well-rounded life which consists of
;» proper proportion of work, play, ]
and love. It is in the "play" part
that he judges football to have a
proper place.
Professor Hulme came to Stanford
directly from a mercantile com
pany. He had not gone through the
seventh and eighth grades of high
school but was admitted as a special
:illit!«'ill. The working liny';. (ir:.l view

of a football game came at Stanford
where he had two team members
for room-mates at Encina. Since
then, Professor Hulme has been in
tensely interested in the game.
"I do think it has been put on j
the market," he remarked. "It
should be an activity for the stu- !
dents and not so much for the out- j
side world."
The historian believes that lately j
the public has, received the great- |
est importance in the planning of
football encounters.
"Another thing," he broke in ab- |
i uptly, "is the emphasis put on win- j
ning. They make it a life and death i
struggle to win—that shouldn't be."
In his earnest manner the widely- I
traveled professor explained that in j
English universities students enjoy!
the games as sports and not as ri- '
v it. in warfare nut j»i• t to win
