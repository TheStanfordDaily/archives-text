# "To Go Greek" Wish Of 265 New Women
## Daily Questionnaire Reveals 60 Per Cent of Aspirants Almost Certain to be Disappointed 
### 
Delving into the perplexities of
sororities and the new women, com
prehensive "Daily" questionnaire
reached and was answered by ap
proximately one-third of the near
-400 new women now on the campus.
Results were well-defined, illumi
nating, perhaps astounding.
As the woman's units piled up,
her desire to enter sororities
dropped. Frosh women to about 88
per cent wanted to "go Greek";
sophomores, only 57 per cent. Jun
iors, but 47 per cent, seniors, 25 per
cent. None of these women have yet
contacted Stanford sororities. Rea
son for drop-off attributed to: (1)
experience; (2) possible affiliations
elsewhere.
Using these percentages as a base,
c>nd multiplying the number of
new women in each ciass by the re
spective percentages — over 265 new
women apparently want to pledge.
Sororities, according to sorority fig
ures, after 1934 graduates leave, will
house about 100 additional women.
Pledging usually amounts to about
80.
Financial impediments, according
to the prospective pledge materials'
own statements, are almost negligi
ble. Optimistic first-year women
students professed that 90 per cent
of them could "make the grade"
monetarily. Again the decline as
year in school goes upward: sophs,
79 per cent; juniors, 68 per cent;
seniors, 25 per cent. It appeared
constant that more women had the
wherewithal to pledge than the
mental desire to do so.
Then a bugaboo appeared: "If not
a sorority—how about joining a
local club of selected women?" "No,"
chorused over three-quarters of the
fresh-women, two-thirds of the
sophomores. Slightly over half of
the juniors and seniors were in fa
vor of the plan, however.
Daily was not quite finished tho':
"Do you prefer dormitory life to
both clubs and sororities?" the
query read. Socially-anxious fresh
men fairly stood on their hind legs,
sh 'ieked, "We do not!" quoth over
four-fifths. Ton per cent were un

decided. Over half the sophomores
also replied negatively. Juniors and
seniors were almost exactly split
between indecision, preference, and
distaste. Juniors liking dormitories
just noscd-out those who did not.
While anonymous and confidential,
questionnaires did provide space for
reasons. Typical comments sounded
thusly for those who had sorority
aspirations:
"Sororities are marvelous institu
tions. They have much to offer in
many fields of university life, and
are beneficial to insure social pres
tige."
"Because it's 'the thing to do.'"
"Because my family are all so
rority or fraternity members."
"Because most of my friends will
be in one."
Some of the 500-swellers thought
their bread was buttered on the
other side, nevertheless. Here these:
"I consider sororities undemocra
tic, that they make artificial bar
riers between women."
"I prefer not to align myself with
a distinct social group. I also prefer
living in a regular dormitory."
One prematui'ely worldy - wise
freshman woman, a bit Margery
Baileyish in tone, said she wanted
to join a sorority to "give me some
thing to talk about—so I could say
'yes' to people if they asked me if
belonged." But she further quali
fied her statement by indicating that
she did not want to join.
Her reasons for so not desiring:
"I don't like the type of girl who
belongs to a solority, the social
climber type. I would prefer dormi
tory life because girls don't try to
take advantage of you there as they
do in a sorority. Ydu get to know
sorority sisters too well."
Significant point in whole ques
tionnaire: Only 13 per cent consid
ered selves financial unable to af
filiate. Approximately 265 out of
400, or 66.25 per cent, would like to
pledge. Between 80 and 100 will be
taken in—or between 20 and 25 per
cent. To be disappointed by either
figure: over 60 per cent of those with
Greek aspirations.
