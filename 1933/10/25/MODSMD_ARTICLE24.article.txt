The repeated and continued oc
currence of sneak thefts has raused
Campus Cop Gordon Davis to issue
a second appeal for co-operation to
the members of campus living
groups. During the past week-end
clothing has been reported missing
from Branner Hall and the S.A.E.
house.
In his latest appeal Davis said,
"The campus is too big for us to
completely patrol, and unless we are
given co-operation we have little
hope of catching ihe culprits. Should
any man unfamiliar to the house be
seen inside or in its immediate vi
cinity, call the police. Let the party
explain to us; we are here to pro
tect the campus."
Adding force to Davis' appeal was
a warning issued by Berkeley po
lice to Night Patrolman G. A. Burns
that two young German-posing stu
dents have been at work in Reno,
and are possibly headed for coast
universities.
Somewhat bewildered and slightly
angered, Officer Davis told the story
of a man in naval uniform who was
caught prowling about a campus fra
ternity house in the wee hours. His
story satisfied the lodge members,
sp they let him go. The incident
came to the police's attention only
after several days had elapsed.
