# Guerard to Talk Tonight
## 
### 
Are disarmament conferences fu
tile gestures, or are they concrete
steps toward a fuller synthesis? Is
international understanding on a
more civilized jilane than it was 15
or 20 years ago? What' is the way
out? What is the significance of the
politics of which Hitler and Musso
lini are symbols?
These are a few of the questions
which will be discussed by fervent
ly-international Professor Albert
Guerard in his talk tonight on "Can
Europe Disarm?" at 7:30 o'clock in
the Palo Alto Community House.
The lecture, which will be an am
plification of Professor Guerard's
message at the recent "San Fran
cisco News" Forum, will be con
cerned, among other things, with re
futing the numerous misconcep
tions which fog the American politi
cal mind in reference to disarma
ment, reparations and war debts, and
kindred subjects. Professor Guerard
has published numerous magazine
articles on the subject of his lectui'e
tonight, which will be open to the
public, free of charge.
