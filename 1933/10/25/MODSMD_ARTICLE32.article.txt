# Aunt Sophie's Passing Mourned by Stanford
## 
### DICK STROUSE 
Thirty-five years ago, sympathetic
but solemn doctor told a fragile
J mite of a woman that heart trouble
made death imminent for her. Last
I summer, the same China-like little
lady (older then, but somehow still
contemporaneous with the college
town in which she had elected to
live) died and was mourned by
Stanford students who had found
Aunt Sophie's heart strong and
sturdy and large enough.
Graccd with the subtle intuition of
a hostess who lived vicariously to
assist and entertain others, the deli
cately-etched tiny old lady in black
silk would have been insulted had
her friends addressed her by her ,
full name of Mrs. Edwin Brcyfogle.
Stanford men and women from Dr.
Swain's undergraduate days to the
present, neighbors in Palo Alto and
San Francisco, military men in In
dia and Afghanistan and Tahiti -all
knew her as Aunt Sophie or Grand
ma B.
It was during the Spanish-Ameri
can wars that Aunt Sophie first be- 1
came an institution. Hers was the
task of entertaining officers sta
tioned at the Presidio, and hers be
came the task of nursing - s ick sol
diers back to health. Asking noth- >
ing but an answering smile, Grand
ma 11.'s objective reward.': in later

years were hundreds of letters and i
pictures and Christmas cards that |
annually filled her little Palo Alto j
' home.
As pleasantly informal and im- !
maculate as the comforting spirit it
housed, thnt little home was the
Sunday night sanctuary of hundreds '
of Stanford students. And always, j
the troubled, the disillusioned, the j
friendly found sympathy and re- j
newed ideals and the gracious wis- '
dom of an alert interest.
Aunt Sophie's benevolence was j
material, too. When other sources
failed, Stanford men went to the
house on Waverley street to receive i
I room and board for a pleasant as- I
; sociation, to "work" in the neat,
vari-colored garden which Aunt
Sophie herself tended.
When Grandma B. died, her me
morial services were attended by
strangely non-cynical Stanford men
and women. When she died, the, San
Francisco Women's Exchange lost an
able administrator, the Palo Alto
1 church groups lost a friend who was
religious .but never intolerant, the
Peninsula lost the continuation of
her patient philanthropy.
When Grandma B. died, Stanford
found a niche in its memory for the
72-year-old little benefactress who i
