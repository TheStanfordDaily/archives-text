# S. C. JOLLY-UP CANCELLED BY EX COMMITTEE
## Constitutional Committee To Be Chosen Soon By Trautman STAGE CURTAIN VOTED Axe Not to Be Displayed In S.F. Stores 
### 
Harmony mixed with dashes of
levity featured Ex Committee's ses
sion last night.
Perhaps most important of all
business to come up for discussion
was the appointment which will be
made next week of a new Constitu
tional committee. This body, which
is to consist of five members, in
cluding Jerry Trautman, will do in
tensive work on a revision of the
existing A.S.S.U. constitution. Traut
man expects to make appointments,
subject to ratification by Executive
Committee.
Social Problem
All the ethics of a social problem
popped out when Lcs Hables pre
sented an opinion showing that, a
joliy-up exclusively for new women
will require one for the old. Arose
some opposition in the form of "orig
inal" women on Ex Committee. They
claimed undue discrimination against
former "500."'
Editor Mellinkofl offered opinion
favoring a jolly-up as a "last chance
to pop up the new women." Fol
lowed more debate, concluded by
Hables' ultimatum lauding advan
tages of two jolly-ups. Result, jolly
up for new women in Basketball
pavilion from 7 to 9 on the evening
of October 31.
Dick Miles, varsity baseball
captain, was appointed as new treas
urer for Class of 3934, succeeding
Ken Addicott.
D.G. dolly-Up
Mere routine business matte r s
passed muster before the Commit
tee. Dolta Gamma was given a jolly
up for November 8, while U.S.C.
game jolly-up plans were canceled,
and request for Masque Ball date
was postponed until next quarter.
Abe Mellinkoff asked and received
assurance that A.S.S.U. dances were
sponsored by Ex Committee, were
successfully concluded by hardwork
ing Rally Committee under super
vision of the Executive Body.
As committee minutes were ap
proved for Rally and Dramatic
Council organizations, Student Man
ager Hables recommended necessary
expenditure of $110 to purchase a
muchly-needed light blue back drop
for Assembly Hall.
At this juncture yawning Jim Tri
olo moved that "the student mana
ger be empowered to do what he
wants about that "Thinga-ma-jig."
Sensible Ex Committee however
modified the motion to name more
specific powers.
Indignation literally flooded the
cigarette-reeking meeting room of
the committee at receipt of a letter
asking a loan of the newly-deco
rated axe for display in one of the
large San Francisco stores. Unani
mous disapproval moved them to
decision of writing a letter to Cali
fornia suggesting that they too,
when and if ever in possession of
the axe, refrain from loaning it any
where outside of the two universi
ties.

Indignation literally flooded the
cigarette-reeking meeting room of
the committee at receipt of a letter
asking a loan of the newly-deco
rated axe for display in one of the

mous disapproval moved them to
decision of writing a letter to Cali

claimed undue discrimination against
former "500."'

to pop up the new women." Fol
lowed more debate, concluded by

tages of two jolly-ups. Result, jolly
up for new women in Basketball
pavilion from 7 to 9 on the evening
of October 31.
