# Honor Societies to Burn
## 
### 
This Campus abounds in dues-collecting, pin-dispens
ing organizations which for want of a better classification
call themselves "honor societies." Only two reasons can be
found for such a title: tlrst, natural desire lor personal
glorification; second, unnatural lack of a normal sense of
humor. These societies are honorary in nothing but name.
In short, they are not honorary at all.
Hut if people are willing to join such groups and pay
their own money, why complain ? The rub comes that with
such a maze of organizations, the worthwhile ones are
lost in the shuttle, do not attract the students they other
wise would. Meanwhile, the glitter of the phonics attracts
students, takes their money, leaves them ten, twenty, or
thirty dollars poorer for an evening's initiation and a key
I<» dangle. Meanwhile, of course, a false standard of what
is worth while is set up around us.
The naming of these groups is even more humorous.
We have "Scalpers" Sonhomore Men's Honorary Society.
They are the lads who carry that painted barrel with the
■leather tied to each end. Fine boys and all that, but honor
men in the sophomore class? A rumor has it that the bar
rel is either lost or busted. If that is the case, what will
they do—this honor society?
Of course, "Skull and Snakes" and "Phi Phi"—men's
honoraries, are. always good for a raise of the eyebrow
when the word "honor" is stressed in the phrase "honor
societies."
Some people even go so far as to say that certain fra
ternities gain control over some of these reputed honora
ries and pass the pins around to their own members. Of
course, the Daily cannot believe that any groups of colle
gians would treat honor so lightly.
The Kx Committee might continue what Robert Hrown,
former student body president, started: apply a hob-nailed
boot to inert honorary carcasses.
