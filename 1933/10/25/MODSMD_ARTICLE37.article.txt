# Lock Your Doors
## 
### 
Students owe il to themselves as well as to campus j
police who try to protect them to lock their doors when
not in their rooms. Within the last few days, clothing has
been stolen from several living quarters oil the Farm.
II is an impossibility for the three officers who cover
this area to make the rounds each morning to see if each
person has locked his door before leaving for classes. One
fraternity was entered by the ever open front door and a
l>olo coal valued at stolen.
Shortly after, several hall men's rooms were visited by
presumably the same man and several suits and overcoats I
taken.
Probably the victims are cursing the Stanford police ;
force for its "inefficiency" in detecting the robber before
lie purloined the valuables. The fact remains, however,!
that the people who lost their belongings have nobody to
blame but themselves. They should realize that this cam
pus is a great drawing card for petty thieves. They should :
further realize that it is entirely within the realm of possi
bility that the deeds were committed by somebody living
on the Farm. There have been such cases before, and there !
will be again.
Hefore you are relieved of something you have, take a
hi.nl and make use of the lock which the University put on 1
vour door. It isn't an ornament.
