Three thousand miles over leased wires from Associ
aled Press headquarters eame the important news yester
day: the students in a Pennsylvania high school are strik
ing because thev can't have a football team.
This sad blow to their educational careers caused such
acute anguish that they felt impelled to leave their classes,!
agree not to return until the faculty rescinded its cruel j
actions.
It is an interesting commentary on the results of Amer
ican education that a thousand students find life practi- J
callv unbearable because eleven of their number aren't
allowed to plav a game.
The faculty could deny to the entire thousand students
the rights of free speech and free assemblage, and prob
ably there would be hardly a whimper of protest, but as
soon as one per cent of their number are prevented from '
playing a game a howl arises to the heavens.
American education will have taken a big step forward
when the students realize that a game is only a game, not
an event of anv importance. TThe fun should be in playing;
it, not in the attendant rallies, rooting sections, eompara-1
live scores, last vear's records, and other childish ballvhoo.!
