VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE IN EN
GINEERING LINES.
Sponsored by The American Asso
ciation of Engineers. Mack Printing
Co.. Easton, Pa. 1933. $2.50. .
j What is an engineer? What does
1 he do? What part does he play, j
I what part should he play, in the life
of the community, the state, and the
I world?
Some fifty prominent Air erican
; engineers have collaborated to pre
i sent, in "Vocational Guidance in
| Engineering Lines," an answer to
these questions and to make a com-
I prehensive survey of the various
fields of engineering and their im
portance to modern industry. The

book will be read with profit by stu
dents contemplating an engineering
career, by those whose duty it is to
guide students in the selections of a
vocation, and by anyone who wishes
to understand the profession respon
sible for the multifarious projects
that have changed the face of the
world and the course of civilization.
This 500-page volume contains a
great fund of information concern
ing the qualifications, duties, and re
wards of various careers in engi
neering. Although some forty spe

cia! brunches of engineering are de- 1
scribed, the necessity for a broad,
basic training in the foundations of i
an engineering education is re
pertedly stressed, and the danger of
too early specialization is likewise '
emphasized, as is the duty of the j:
engineer to attain a clear under
standing of his social obligations in
an industrialized world.
Such a book should do much to
attract to the engineering profession
the intelligent and ambitious young
man whose character and habit of
mind mark him out for success in
applying science for the benefit of
mankind. What is equally impor
tant, such a book should prevent
waste and misdirection of effort by
making clear the exacting demands
of such a career and dissuading
from it the indolent and incompe- 1

tent.
Since many minds are represented
in the various chapters of the book,
it is unreasonable to expect that any
unified impression of engineering
will remain with the reader. Enthu
siasm is aroused by most of the con
tributors not by "inspirational" or
"romantic" appeals, but by bringing
out the intrinsic significance and
fascination of the engineer's work.
