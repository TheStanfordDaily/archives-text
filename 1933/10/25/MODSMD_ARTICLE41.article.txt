## northwestern was NOT SO WEAK 
### 
We follow with interest the ca
rter of the lowa Hawkeyes, for years
regarded as the weak sister of the
Big Ten, and the team that made
Stanford a pronounced favorite over
Northwestern. When little lowa
bounced big Northwestern all over
Ihe field and won 7-0, the cagey ex
perts put 2 and 2 together and got
22. "H . . . m . . . m," they said, and
put Northwestern down for a poor
rating.
Now little lowa is right up at the
lop of the Big Ten with two victo
ries and no defeats; having crushed
Wisconsin 2G-7 they are considered
a fair to middling team. Meanwhile
Northwestern has further established
herself by falling on Indiana and
winning 25-0. Indiana may not be
so much; they only held Minnesota
even and gave Notre Dame a big
scare.
Now the Big Ten is prepared for
two critical struggles. lowa vs. Min
nesota and Ohio State vs. North
western.
