# CHUCK WHITE FINALLY GETS HIS BREAK
## 
### 
Now that there Chuck White boy
proved that he can powerhouse 'em
plenty in the S.F.U. game. We've
been waiting around a long while to
see this lad get a break and when it
came, he took full opportunity of
it. White is a splendid defensive
half and he romped over right tackle
for some nice gains WHEN he had
some interference. Chuck looked bad
when he was struck by a S.F.U.
punt and the Dons recovered. On
thai play a gust of wind took the ball
right at White, who couldn't dodge
it because he was surrounded by a
swarm of Don tacklers.
