# THORNHILL DRIVES TEAM; WORKS ON OFFENSIVE PUNCH
## 
### Oliver Johnston, Jr 
Driving his men hard, until nearly
7 o'clock, Thornhill crammed a
whole week's scrimmage into two
hours of work last night. It was
without doubt the hardest scrim
mage the Indians have had to go
through this season.
The main purpose of this long
work-out was to install a scoring
punch into the offense. The attempt
proved to have been worthwhile, for
aiong about 6 o'clock the line started
to dig in and open holes for Reis
ner, Alustiza, and Van Dellen. Time
and again they punched it over from
the 15-yard line in less than the re
quired amount of downs.
Moscriu Carries-Ball
Fast, shifty Monk Moscrip may do
some of the ball carrying in the
Washington game. A double reverse
with Monk getting the ball netted
some good gains last night.
Reisner, especially, showed up
well, crossing at least two stripes on
most of his jaunts. A lot of credit
should go to Woody Adams for run
ning excellent interference. Jack
Hillman looked like a steam roller
when he got going. He seemed to
be able to push the whole line in
front of him for two or three yards.
White Outstanding
In this Scrimmage of all Scrim
mages there were many outstanding
bits of work. Among these was
Chuck White's brilliant defensive
work at half. White was through to
drop the backs before the linemen
were.
Bones Hamilton, with a helmet
which resembled a pumpkin, ran
through signals, but did not take
part in scrimmage. Bobby Grayson
also seems to be fast recovering
and warmed up with signals and
kicking.
Ed Lettunich With an injured leg
and Bruce Tarver with a hard knock
on the shoulder were the only cas
ualties.
