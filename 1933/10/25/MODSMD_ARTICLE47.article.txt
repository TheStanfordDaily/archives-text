Establishing without a doubt his {
superiority on the freshman golf
team, "Unknown" Elmer Stoddard
out mashied his nearest rival, How
aid Clark, by a three and two mar
gin in the week-end feature of the
frosh ladder.
Pep on this year's team seems to
radiate. The eighth position is par
ticularly active and is the seen of
the week's greatest activity. Sat
urday, George Berkey repulsed Er
nie Sultan's bid for the number seven
position. Monday, Sultan lost the last
man's position to Halaby. Sultan lost
both matches by a three and two
margin. j
Lower on the ladder, soft speak- 1
ing, small, Donald Trumbull, climbed |
two rungs on the ladder. He gained j
his victories at the expense of En- ,
neking and Rhodes.
