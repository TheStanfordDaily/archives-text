# Graduate Women Meet To Plan Organization
## 
### 
| Graduate women students, Stan- '
1 ford's social orphans, will meet to
day at 4 o'clock in the Women's j
Clubhouse to discuss the possibili
ties of forming an organization. Of- j
ficers will be elected and plans for
the year made.
The absence of special living j
groups for the grads makes the need !
for a social center evident. The pur- i
pose of the group is to make the
graduate women better acquainted
with each other.
