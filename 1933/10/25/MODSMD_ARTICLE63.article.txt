# CARD SOCCERMEN MEET SAN MATEO
## 
### 
Restored in confidence by their j
5 to 1 win over the San Jose soccer
team, Stanford soccermen clash with I
San Mateo J.C.'s varsity at 4:15
o'clock this afternoon on the soccer j
green.
Rudy Gonzales, having returned j
from the injured list; Dick Strouse j
and Waddy White being back, and !
the entire varsity being improved, a j
likely victory is the prospect. The !
Jaj'.see players, however, have a
clever and skilled mechanism which
already has defeated the Bear squad j
twice and is no knockdown.
The playing of the forward line!
has been improved, as evidenced by j
the four points rung up last Satur- '
day. The offensive power may be j
aggrandized by the shifting up of i
Johnny Moore. Playing at either j
center half or forward, Moore can i
kick with the best of them and is j
one of the strongest cogs of the
varsity. With Art Hearn, who i
scored two of Saturday's points; all -
conference Carl Knecht, captain;
Miguel Gomez, Chuck Emerick, Sven
Doddington, and Carl Krebs from
whom to select an aggressive five
rnan forward line, Coach Harry Ma
loney will be able to organize a :
goalie-harassing offensive.
John Hitchcock, Gonzales, Moore,
White, Dave Dunning, Ralph Cotter,
and Louis Bansbach make a fit
bunch of halfs from whom a de
pendable and hard-playing three- '
man line can be selected.
Cy Johnson and Strouse will un
doubtedly play the fullback posi- j
tions. Jack King will be in the !
goalmouth exhibiting his usual abil- j
ity and his new long distance throw
which catapults the ball half way j
down the field. Milt Newman may j
alternate with King at goal.
