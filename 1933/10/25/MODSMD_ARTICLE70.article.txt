# "Crab Party" Planned By Cosmopolitan Club
## 
### 
Hair from a horse's tail, samples j
of a policeman's handwriting, are
two of the things which might be re- ,
quired as loot by those attending |
Ihe Cosmopolitan Club scavenger!
hunt Saturday evening, October 28,
starting at 8 o'clock, from the |
Women's Clubhouse. A fee of 15 i
cents will be charged.
Anyone is invited to attend the j
party, which Englishman Paul
Dykes, president of the club, prefers
to call a "crab party." Several per
sons in each car are allowed to com
bine ideas as to ways and mean of
collecting the necessary articles. The
first carload to return to the
Women's Clubhouse wins a prize.
Everyone will be treated to refresh
ments after their probably hectic
wanderings.
