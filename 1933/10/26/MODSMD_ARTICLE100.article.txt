# TRAGEDY SEEN SHERIDAN BAIT
## 
### James Sandoe 
Although the role seems to epito
; mize all playwrights, Mr. Puff, the
! leading character in Sheridan's "The
1 Critic; or, A Tragedy Rehears'd," to
| be presented by the Palo Alto Com
munity Players on Thursday eve
ning, November 2, was originally
written as a thrust at Mr. Richard j
Cumberland, an actor-playwright of :
the eighteenth century.
Cumberland detested Sheridan; '
1 the latter regarded him with a re- !
i served amusement. It is said that j
when Cumberland took his children
! to the opening of "The School for ;
! Scandal," they laughed heartily
much to the mortification of their
! jealous father.
Pinched Them
He pinched them, exclaiming, j
; "What are you laughing at, my dear I
! little folks? You should not laugh, I
I my dear little angels, there is noth
| ing to laugh at." Told of the episode
I Sheridan remarked, "Devilish un
| grateful that, for 1 sat out his trag- i
!t dy last week and laughed from |
j beginning to end."
i And the reaction of modern audi- j
j trices to Mr. Puff s tragedy, "The i
Spanish Armada," which composes
j the last two acts of "The Critic," may
be expected to be much the same, j
For in it Sheridan has poked un- j
merciful fun at actors and play- !
wrights, the stiff conventionalities of 1
bad tragedy and the laughable pos- i
I ing of actors "of the old school."
Ridicule Bright
One hundred and fifty-four years i
have not dulled the ridicule. With
; the exception of two or three purely j
| topical references, the major por- |
J tions of the comedy are as relevant
! and as hilarious today as they ever j
j were.
In the Players' production, the ,
characters in Puff's tragedy will be ;
i portrayed by Marian Jones, Andy
I Harris, Henry Brill, A1 Bogan, Dick j
Dawson, June Birchard, Matthew j
! Evans, Powell Ownby, Neal Berry. !
1 Sally Lane, Mrs. E F. Kempston, and j
1 Mary Rodgers.
Robert Brauns will be Puff, sup
ported by such capable actors as j
James Broughton, Robert Balzer, i
Myna Hughes, and Enid Olivi —in i
' addition to the members of the j
: Drury Lane Theatre acting com- I
. pany already mentioned.

Although the role seems to epito
; mize all playwrights, Mr. Puff, the
! leading character in Sheridan's "The
1 Critic; or, A Tragedy Rehears'd," to
| be presented by the Palo Alto Com
munity Players on Thursday eve
ning, November 2, was originally
written as a thrust at Mr. Richard j
Cumberland, an actor-playwright of :
the eighteenth century.
Cumberland detested Sheridan; '
1 the latter regarded him with a re- !
i served amusement. It is said that j
when Cumberland took his children
! to the opening of "The School for ;
! Scandal," they laughed heartily
much to the mortification of their
! jealous father.
Pinched Them
He pinched them, exclaiming, j
; "What are you laughing at, my dear I
! little folks? You should not laugh, I
I my dear little angels, there is noth
| ing to laugh at." Told of the episode
I Sheridan remarked, "Devilish un
| grateful that, for 1 sat out his trag- i
!t dy last week and laughed from |
j beginning to end."
i And the reaction of modern audi- j
j trices to Mr. Puff s tragedy, "The i
Spanish Armada," which composes
j the last two acts of "The Critic," may
be expected to be much the same, j
For in it Sheridan has poked un- j
merciful fun at actors and play- !
wrights, the stiff conventionalities of 1
bad tragedy and the laughable pos- i
I ing of actors "of the old school."
Ridicule Bright
One hundred and fifty-four years i
have not dulled the ridicule. With
; the exception of two or three purely j
| topical references, the major por- |
J tions of the comedy are as relevant
! and as hilarious today as they ever j
j were.
In the Players' production, the ,
characters in Puff's tragedy will be ;
i portrayed by Marian Jones, Andy
I Harris, Henry Brill, A1 Bogan, Dick j
Dawson, June Birchard, Matthew j
! Evans, Powell Ownby, Neal Berry. !
