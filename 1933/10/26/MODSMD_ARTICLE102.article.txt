Encina warfare by milk bottle bombs
and electric light globe grenades.
Hostilities flared up considerably
i Tuesday night, or to be more exact,
j Wednesday morning. Reason: re-
I sonant voice of Bing Crosby floating
| from loud speakr.r on ground floor.
I Under a blanket of blue, Crosby let
i loose with still higher frequency
j and greater volume.
Heads shot out of windows from
ail sides , of house shouting, "Turn
i off the damned radio." Damned ra
dio refused to be turned off. Result:
i Bottles crashed to cement patio.
I Light bulbs et cetera showered, and
| all heads drew under cover. Feeble
j voices of would-be authoritative
j sponsors ignored. Bulbs and bottles
I continued to pop at intervals. Noise
' finally drowned by shifting and
| emptying of garbage cans in alley.
