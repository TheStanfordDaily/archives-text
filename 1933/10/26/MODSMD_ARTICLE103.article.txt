## 
### 
SEATTLE, Wash., Oct. 24 (P.1.P.).
|—A genuine girls' band has been
j organized — uniforms and all —to
j play at football games and rallies at
j the University of Washington.
"There is no reason why this band
should not be as popular as the
men's pep band," declared the music
professor sponsoring the organiza
i tion. At present they lack a drum
| major, but we are thinking of sub-
J stituting a torch singer."
j The band will make its first ap
i pearance on November 11 at the
Washington-U.S.C. game.

Those living in Sequoia Hall have
gone in for group singing after din
ner as a good method of digestion.
