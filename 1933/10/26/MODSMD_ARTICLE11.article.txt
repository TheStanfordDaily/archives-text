# '800' to Trek To Gym Dance
## Tonight's Party Features Feminine Notables 
### 
To the Women's Gym tonight will
trek'the "800" en masse, to the an
nual Conference parly, where for
three hours classes will be forgotten,
while dancing, skits, oratory, and
costume parades will be the center
of attraction.
Jeanne Millard in Charge
President of the Women, Jeanne
Millard, will be in charge of the eve
ning's entertainment, and will in
troduce to newcomers some of the
notable personages in the feminine
world of Stanford. Among these will
be Dean of Women Mary Yost, red
haired Mary Rath of Pan-Hellenic,
athlete Babe Dear of W.A.A.,
women's editor of the Daily, Molly
Phillips.
Feminine talent of every sort will
bo granted ample opportunity for
display. From the â–  number of as
piring dramatists on the campus
will come Ann Wheeler and Katrina
Wallingford, who will attempt to
outdo each other in the production
of skits. Dorothy Bernhardt will
present her latest contribution to
the world of jazz with the vocal aid
of Mary Louise Stewart.
Prize for Best Costume
Rewarding the ingenious mind,
tribute will be paid to the member
of the "800" wearing the best cos
tume. Red-checked laundry bags
will undoubtedly be in* evidence,
while reminiscences of past Confer
ence parties bring to mind such cos
tumes as Indians, Hawaiians, arid
Nuns. Lounging pajamas have often
proved godsends to bewildered,
rushed new women.
The only men to gain entrance
will be Gordon Heche and the mem
bers of his music-making band.
