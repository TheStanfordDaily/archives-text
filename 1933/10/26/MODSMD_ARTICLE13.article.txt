# Graham Stuart Favors Recognition of Russia
## 
### FRANCES AYRES 
With Soviet Delegate Litvinoff !
approaching American shores to
confer with President Roosevelt,
public attention turns to the antici- |
pated recognition of Russia by the
United States.
Said ruddy - cheeked Professoi
Graham Stuart on the subject:
"I favor most heartily the recog
nition of Russia. Jefferson's state
ment that 'every nation has a l ight
to govern itself internally under
whatever form it pleases and to J
change these forms at its own will'
is good policy today.
"The normal requirements for
recognition are stability and the ful
fillment of international obligations.!
The Soviet Government has shown
far greater stability than many
quickly recognized Latin American
stales. As to fulfillment of interna
tional obligations, Russia has offered
to discuss the debt question, and.
considering the f;n "renter amount,'

lowed to us by other recognized na- i
lions, this obstacle should not be !
difficult to surmount.
"The bogey of Bolshevism," St.ii
urt added, "has always seemed to j
me to be of little consequence, and
certainly under Stalin the Third In- j
ternational has less support than
ever."
"When the world needs co-op
eration as never before, to combat
the economic situation and to pro
tect its post-war peace machinery
| in the crisis of the Orient, the
United States should throw every
ounce of its influence immediately |
in this direction.
"A prompt recognition of Russia
! by the new administration would be
a long step forward toward improv
ing the world economic relations j
and would simplify considerably the
pioblem of dealing with Japan. And,
finally, it. would put us in a far more
secure situation in these dangerous
days."
