# Gaiety Contest Closes Nov. 6
## Anson Weeks to Feature Campus Music 
### 
This year's super-production on
cvo of the Big Game, November 24,
will be known again as the Big
Game Gaieties, as it has been titled
since it's first debut under Hel
venston five years ago.
From all present indications,
Ram's Head hopes to take up the
gauntlet, will sponsor the evening
of hilarity. All the musical, scenic,
and chorus features of past years
will be repeated on a scale com
parable to former successes.
12 Days More
Twelve days remain before dead
line for sketch contributions, the
contest promising to be close this
year. Maestro Helvenston already
acknowledges receipt of some
clever sketches, while well informed
campus dramatic fans admit there
is furious activity on the row, in
various houses who are writing
song and music offerings.
Remarkable work in the musical
vein has been done by two cam
pus lyricists, Dorothy Bernhardt
and Eleanor Weinmann. Two of
their musical compositions will be
broadcast over N.B.C. chain by An
son Weeks from Mark Hopkins Ho
tel, as a form of pre-Gaiety adver
tising. These numbers will later
constitute large part of musical
score in the actual production.
Name Director Soon
In a few days dance director of
the chorus will be named. Gaiety
heads promise a very well-known
Stanford artist, with considerable
musical production experience at his
fingertips.
Considerable talk favors a master
of ceremonies to insure smooth
stage offerings between various
sketches. He will be a campus stu
dent, with several campus come
dians already under consideration
for the job.
