Search for Barrett Willoughby
Dobbs, Stanford student and son
of Hugh Barrett Dobbs, popular
radio announcer, was pressed last
night by San Francisco and state
wide police agencies, after the de
serted high powered car of young
Dobbs was discovered early yes
terday morning in San Francisco.
Objects of the search were two
".suspicious looking" men seen with
Dobbs Tuesday afternoon in his car
on Market street. At the lime Dobbs
was seen, lie seemed to be in a
drugged or "beaten up" condition,
the youth's father said.
Feared Kiknapped
Fear that the 20-year-old boy,
missing since Monday morning when
he left for school, had been kid
napped was strengthened yesterday
when an unsigned telegram sent
from San Francisco was received at
the family home in Burlingame.
Though the message offered ivj clue
as to the whereabouts of the miss
ing youth, it was thought to be the
initial effort of the abductors to es
tablish contact with the family. Text
of the communication was not made
known.
Last night Mrs. Dobbs said she
feared foul play, because no mes
sage had been received frbm the
youth. It was not uncommon for
him to spend a day or two away
from home, but he always phoned
home, she said.
Carried Checks
At the time of his disappearance
Dobbs was carrying a $50 check to
cover part of his university ex
penses. This fact caused his parents
to feel no worry, however, when
the boy did not return home on
time, as they thought he might be
"having a good time with some col
lege f'-iends."
Failing to get in touch with
Dobbs after several phone calls
to the Stanford campus, the boy's
father enlisted police aid Tuesday
morning (bough the affair was not
made public until later in the
afternoon.
Dobbs is about six feet tall, and
husky. He ha.s blue eyes and brown
hair. Entering Stanford last year as
a junior transfer from Menlo, Dobbs
joined the Theta Delta Chi frater
nity. He is an economics major.
