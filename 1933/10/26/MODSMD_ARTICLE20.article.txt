# Stampede on the Horizon
## 
### 
The thundering herd of French heels that will Irv to
storm up Lnsuen next quarter was clearly indicated by the
Daii.v questionnaire. The thundering, and perhaps weep
ing, herd that will come trailing hack in hitler disappoint
ment was also clearly indicated. Sixty per cent of the new
women who have (irccian aspirations will lind such aspira
tions adequately nipped.
This is only natural, for while there are sororities for
the "f)00," the "f>()0" is gone. There is a new order. There
is an attempt to run the new load on the old trolley. The
vehicle can't stand the load.
It is not a question of whether joining ;i sorority is de
sirable or not. It remains that girls want to do it. The
Administration does not stitlc this feminine desire. It per
mits its gratification for some by having nine sororities.
Hut the nine cannot take care of this year's demand.
What is to be done? Let the ship drift and the gals
make Roblc a tower of tears after pledging is over? For
the figures indicate that is what will happen. The {act that
a selected (not necessarily select) group will go up the row,
will make many of I hose who fail to go feel inferior, neg
lected, miserable.
Action can be taken. J! must be taken.
First, most drastic, but a cure-all abolish all Stanford
sororities by slopping rushing this year and in the future.
This would lit in most splendidly with the plans of Dean
Yost for small living groups, nou-sororitv in nature.
Or second, add more sororities to take care of the sur
plus women. This would make sororities the same blessing
or evil that they have been in the past.
Or third, expand the facilities of the present houses to
accommodate the added women. Physically unfeasible,
such a plan is almost certain to expand houses to a "non
sorority" size.
Hut whatever policy is selected, that policy should be
placed into operation now. Journalistically, it would be
better to print this editorial the night after pledging. Then
these seemingly cruel words would be burning salt in al
icady tear-stained eyes. Then, a real fuss could be raised.
Hut now, the stampede is on the horizon, not under our
noses. It is easy to shelve the problem because it is easy
to drift. Hut drifting down the old channel without noting
that we have passed the "f>00" mark, may soon lind the
women's ship out in the open sea without oars, anchor, or
even a compass. The possibility is perilous at least peri
lous to the feelings of many Stanford women.

The thundering herd of French heels that will Irv to
storm up Lnsuen next quarter was clearly indicated by the
Daii.v questionnaire. The thundering, and perhaps weep
ing, herd that will come trailing hack in hitler disappoint
ment was also clearly indicated. Sixty per cent of the new
women who have (irccian aspirations will lind such aspira
tions adequately nipped.
This is only natural, for while there are sororities for
the "f)00," the "f>()0" is gone. There is a new order. There
is an attempt to run the new load on the old trolley. The
vehicle can't stand the load.
It is not a question of whether joining ;i sorority is de
sirable or not. It remains that girls want to do it. The
Administration does not stitlc this feminine desire. It per
mits its gratification for some by having nine sororities.
Hut the nine cannot take care of this year's demand.
What is to be done? Let the ship drift and the gals
make Roblc a tower of tears after pledging is over? For
the figures indicate that is what will happen. The {act that
a selected (not necessarily select) group will go up the row,
will make many of I hose who fail to go feel inferior, neg
lected, miserable.
Action can be taken. J! must be taken.
First, most drastic, but a cure-all abolish all Stanford
sororities by slopping rushing this year and in the future.
This would lit in most splendidly with the plans of Dean
Yost for small living groups, nou-sororitv in nature.
Or second, add more sororities to take care of the sur
plus women. This would make sororities the same blessing
or evil that they have been in the past.
Or third, expand the facilities of the present houses to
accommodate the added women. Physically unfeasible,
such a plan is almost certain to expand houses to a "non
sorority" size.
Hut whatever policy is selected, that policy should be
placed into operation now. Journalistically, it would be
better to print this editorial the night after pledging. Then
these seemingly cruel words would be burning salt in al
icady tear-stained eyes. Then, a real fuss could be raised.
Hut now, the stampede is on the horizon, not under our
noses. It is easy to shelve the problem because it is easy
to drift. Hut drifting down the old channel without noting
that we have passed the "f>00" mark, may soon lind the
women's ship out in the open sea without oars, anchor, or
even a compass. The possibility is perilous at least peri
lous to the feelings of many Stanford women.
