# Stanford Campus Almost Became Cinema Studio

Hollywood's platinum blondes and
other cinematic miracles might today
be making the site of the University
their headquarters if Senator Stan
ford had continued his interest in
moving pictures instead of found
ing a college.
The art of motion pictures is con
ceded to have gotten its initial start
j here some 59 years ago when experi
ments and research were conducted
; by Stanford to determine the gait
] of a trotting horse.
Having wagered $25,000 with a I
I friend that a horse, when trotting,
raises all four feet from the ground
during a cycle of motion, the Sena
tor essayed to prove it. He hired
E. J. Muybridge, famed photogra- I
pher, in 1872 to help him. Together,
they rigged up a series of cameras
rlong the railing of the Stanford
race track, which took successive
photos of a horse passing in front
of them. Projected in a strip, the
pictures proved Iho Senator was

correct. Not only did he collect his
bel, and changed all theories of ani
mal motion, but the country gentle
man founder was able to train his
horses' paces to the maximum speed
and win several world records for
his stables.
In 1878 and '70, more elaborate
experiments were conducted on the
stock farm. Muybridge, genuinely
interested, found that 24 earners,
placed 12 inches apart, produced the'
figure of a man or animal in motion.
Recognition of the value of these
experiments was commemorated
May 8, 1029, when Stanford held
"Movie Day." Ii was then, the
plaques in the Quad and on the site
of the old stock farm were impres
sively unveiled by such film celeb
rities as Louis Mayer, of Met.ro-
Goldwyn-Mayer. While Hollywood
was at Stanford, President Wilbur
in Washington, serving time as sec
retary of interior, sent greetings via
a special talking picture.
