# HAMILTON BACK FOR STRENUOUS GRID PRACTICE
## Palamountain Is Injured As Thornhill Conducts Final Workout CHANCES TO WIN FAIR Shift May Be Abandoned Against Washington 
### Spud Hamilton 
I With till hands in good shape', ex
cepting Ben Palamountain, the
Stanford varsity tapered off their
practice sessions with a medium
stiff workout last night, it was a
great relief to a team that had ex
pended the limit of energy in two
days of grueling work, Monday and
Tuesday.
Ilamiiton Back Again
Bob Hamilton was in there fol
lowing his interference, running
j hard with his head thrown hack in
the characteristic Hamiltonian fin
ish. After the neat game played by
Chuck White against U.S.F. and the
attention Buck Van Dellen has re
ceived this week in practice, the
'Indians appear to be better fortified
at halfback than ever. There ought
to be a lot of touchdowns among
Bub Maentz, Johnny Reisner, and
Van Dellen at left half; and Ken
Afflerbaugh, Hamilton, and White
at right half.
Bobby Grayson reported out of
the hospital with his leg bound up
like a mummy's and while prac
tice for hi 111 lacked some of the
ordinary /est. lie will probably
see service at Seattle Saturday.
At present, either Frank Alusti/.a
! or Jack Hillman is favored to
| start, with the choice hinging on
the weather conditions at game
time.
Definite abandonment of the shift
now seems certain, and Ted Husing's
patient explanation of the "ques
tion mark" set is all gone for
nought. It is believed that the shift
I v.-as unnecessai il.v wearing un the
! players, and that too much stress
j was laid on hopping correctly into
position.
"Mebbe so, mebbe so," says Os
car, the office icnnoci: ::t, "but what I
want to know is did Oregon State
shift or not against U.S.C.? And I
hope Howard Jones don't read what
you said about the shift, because he
may take it to heart just like ha
did way back in 1928 when Pop
Warner popped off and said much
! the same thing.

hasn't won a game from U.S.C."

the characteristic Hamiltonian fin
ish. After the neat game played by
Chuck White against U.S.F. and the
attention Buck Van Dellen has re

'Indians appear to be better fortified
at halfback than ever. There ought
to be a lot of touchdowns among
Bub Maentz, Johnny Reisner, and
Van Dellen at left half; and Ken
Afflerbaugh, Hamilton, and White
at right half.
