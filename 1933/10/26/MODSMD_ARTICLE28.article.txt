Alter yesterday's editorial cartoon depicting the Daily's j
dislike for phoney fraternities, il may seem paradoxical to
encourage von and vonsc to gel interested in extra-currieu

lar activities on the campus.
Nevertheless, there arc honor groups and such that are :
vital to the edification of students in many lines of work.;
The latest example is the Forum Club, which will hold
periodical meetings on matters of wide interest. II you
enjoy participating in or listening to good arguments, here j
is your chance to brush up on national and world affairs.
Similarly, other organizations are maintained for the j
interests of Stanfordites in many fields. Many already have
taken advantage of opportunities which have come to them
and joined the clubs. You'll get back your initiation fee
many times over if you take active interest, instead ot
depending on sometimes cold, feelingless books.
