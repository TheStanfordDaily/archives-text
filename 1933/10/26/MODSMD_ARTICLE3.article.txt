# Recovery Road?
##

America's stock and commodity
markc 'o hummed merrily along yes
terday. Badly pinched by NRA
price-upping, farmers viewed with
satisfaction and hope the 3-cent rise
in wheat and corn. Leading stocks
closed from 1 to 5 points higher,
paper profits grew, brokers breathed
more easily.
Cause of the boom is F.R.'s policy
of higher prices through a man
aged currtncy. As an important
step on the road to recovery, price
RFC may pay for newly mined gold
was fixed at $31.36, 25 cents or
more above the world price.
White House and "Brain Trust"
theory behind this move: Hope that
higher domestic gold prices will
mean climbing commodity prices.
Meanwhile, California's gold mines
were the scene of feverish activity,
fervent hopes.
