# Sales Tax, Why Not Revolution?
## 
### 
The docility of the average human being seems to he
matched only by his forgetfulness and his slavislmess to
habit. Time makes us agreeable to almost anything.
A few weeks ago we all hollered and raged about the
sales tax; every time we paid the extra cent we waxed
satirical about "Jimmy's Pennies" and vowed never to for
give this stupid inconvenience.
Today a tirade against the sales tax is as rare as it was
frequent a short time ago. Mere repetition of a thing for
a lew weeks is enough to make lis become habituated to
it and forget our prejudices.
This leads us to suspect that if prohibition had been
really enforced from the beginning, by this time we would
all be teetotalers and not minding in the least. Similarly,
if the inuch-talked-of social revolution actually arrives, we
will all probably get habituated to the new order and ac
cept il calmlv and uncomplaining.
