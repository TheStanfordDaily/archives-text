# Why Not a Correspondence School?

The Sunday supplements are full of advertisements in
forming all coupon-clippers how they can master the 87
fields of human knowledge in ten easy lessons. The lure
of the correspondence school is indeed great.
In fact, there are probably but three advantages lo a
regular college over the Ihrougb-tbe-mail method.
First, the reported cultural atmosphere of a college
campus. This is suposed to breed a cultural yen in the
farm and city boys who are turned loose on the, campus.
Whether this is the case with any great number is an open
question at any stage of the ganle; especially is il true
when one happens to hear the average collegian conversa
tion. A decent vocabulary is branded as "six-bit" words.
And intellectual subjects are frowned upon at best, horse
laughed as a rule.
Second, the reported advantage of oral lectures and the
Socratie method generally. Many of the professors one is
sure would be better oil' if their lectures were mimeo
graphed and distributed to the students, lo be read in the
quiet of one's room with a cup of coffee, stimulants being
decidedly necessary. Of course, those few who really put
their message over compensate for the deadwood.
The third advantage, the real advantage, and the one
lew appreciate is the out-of-classroom contact with the
professors and members of the Administration. I hey are
human beings, many of them. oil come to enjoy their
personalities by an informal chat. You can meet them on
an equal footing in the privacy of their oflices argue with
them, lake issue with them, and still remain friends with
them.
The last advantage is the best.
