# BULL SESSION
## SCREEN SHAKESPEARE 
### 
The movie industry is admittedly j
1 smart. It keeps its flamboyant head ;
j up. Opportunity need knock only j
once at the much-secretaried doors'
10l Hollywood film executives. It
; will be welcomed with a smile and
' a contract.
One golden egg, however, has not
! yet been hatched: the filming of
Shakespeare's dramatic works on a!
1 large scale —37 talking picture mas- !
I terpieces which should (and with a 1
little National Education Association
prodding, would) sell to every high
tchool, college, and university in the
i country.
Most of the enjoyment of Shakc
j speare depends on correct interpre
| tation of the lines, a task somewhat
beyond the abilities of the average
i high school .senior or college fresh
-1 man.
The comic spirit, perhaps, is the
j greatest barrier between age and
i age. Hemingway's post-war charac
ters, bitter-filled with urbane and
| cultivated disillusionment, perpe
trated a type of humor which to the
present college generation is incom
prehensible, a trifle imbecilic. Even
the 1933 type of humor bears a dif
| ferent timbre than does the 1929
i Puj'k Avenue variety. Humor is
| even more changeable than eco
| nomics. The modern reader of
i Shakespeare, reading comic verses, >

[finds it difficult to visualize the ac
i Lions which are implied. Such a
' failure could be nullified by well
| acted movies.
This»incommunicability of humor,
j as well as of wit, causes many ele
i mentary students to suffer keen in
jtcllectual disappointment when they
I read such comedies as "Love's La
' hour's Lost" and "Comedy of Er
! rors." Because there readers use
J the lines as only lines, and their
tastes are baffled by such puns as
"tide" and "tied," however, that
whenever these "critics" get a
chance to .see the plays, their snap
verdicts are reversed.
Obviously, however, few students
have either the money or the op
portunity to see as many plays as
they would like to. Here is where
(the Utopian school, with a complete
slock of Shakespearean films, would
step in, and fill the crying intellec
tual need.
The schools would raise the hue
end cry of not being able to afford
| such an educational orgy. Why
couldn't they? Annually school
, boards vote millions of dollars for
the purchase of laboratory supplies.
Students of English literature need
a laboratory of Shakespeare every
bit as much as embryonic chemists
need test tubes and chemicals.
