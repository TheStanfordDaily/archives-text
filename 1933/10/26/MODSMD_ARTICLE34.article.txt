Granted that the popular concep
-1 lion of the clever gangster can ap
propriately be mixed with whole
j some sentiment, "Lady for a Day"
is worth your while. Thanks to the
| metamorphosis through which "As
| «ene Lupin, "Trouble in Paradise,"
1 ind "The Little Giant" have gone,
i the gangster and his pal now reach
(further heights—in actually induc
ing governor, mayor, and police to .
I assist in a praiseworthy cause.
It all conies about when one Apple
! Annie, in a quaint game of hers, per
suades her illegitimate daughter that
\ she is actually the child of a so
ciety matron —then the game re
| volves upon the city's underworld
'to carry on. With gangsters, confi
i dence men, and gunmen bowing
about in stiff shirts, the game works
| completely, and little daughter goes
' ofT to Europe again, happily wedded
jto a Spanish nobleman. There is
much sobbing and wiping of noses,
: but even at that the'gangster motif
, never loses its color, and the Door
way to Hell remains as attractive as
I ever.
May Robson does an excellent
1 piece of characterization. As the
withered apple-vendor, she excites
the warmest admiration for her gin- 1
soaked antics; as the lady for a day,,
I she becomes suddenly and delight-
I fully straight-shouldered.
I Warren William dresses well,
I speaks well, and serves well as the,
butt for the sharp and clever quips
I oi the redoubtable Ned Sparks. But
) the piece de resistance is the work
of Guy Kibbe as the husband of the
| remade peddler, and carries off the
j n'»le in grand style—bald head,
chubby cheeks, et al. —Hoffman

Beginning with a young army of
ficer's "fini" note to a young .seam
stress, the narrative relates the
young woman's thwarted attempt at
suicide and her subsequent rise to
Hollywood cinema fame. Naturally,
she returns to Paris and is loved by
the gentleman, who, foiling to rec
ognize her, is put through a series
of embarrassing circumstances.
There then follows a complicated
train of events in which she appears
alternately as Anna, his first love,
and as Irene, the movie queen—and
ultimately he wins them both in one
swoop.
Madeline Renaud as the Anna-
Irene, and Pierre Blanchar as Rol
lon are * both well-known French
performers, and Ihey succeed in
malting the film highly amusing, de
spite Mile. Renaud's tendency to
giggle with abandon. —Shaw
