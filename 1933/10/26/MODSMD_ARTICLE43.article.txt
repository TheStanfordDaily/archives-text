SEATTLE, Wash., Oct. 24 (P.1.P.).
â€”Plans for making "good taste,"
rather than hard-bound rules, the
regulating force on University co
eds were discussed by the standards
committee of the University of
Washington recentlv.
"We have not made definite plans
for this 'good taste' campaign," the
chairman stated. "The idea will
probably be carried to the co-eds
by talks at sorority meetings, Moth
ers' Club, and other women's
groups."
