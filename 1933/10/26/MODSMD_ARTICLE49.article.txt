Die Luft der Freiheit welit
The Editor, Sir:
In recent translations of our
motto, I note, "Luft" is taken as
plural (which would be "Lufte"), j
and I wonder if students who cher
ish this motto would not appreciate
a glimpse of the context from which
it was taken, together with a refer- |
ence to a book that will acquaint |
them with a phase of Dr. Jordan's!
gteatness aside from what they hear
on his building of Stanford, his emi- |
nence in the science of zoology, and J
his services on the seal commission.
"The Story of the Innumerable ;
Company, and Other Sketches," by i
David Starr Jordan, 1896, San Fran- j
cisco: Whitaker Ray Co., 294 pp., is
the book. The sixth sketch is "A
Knight of the Order of Poets" (pp.
207-224), the self-chosen title of an ;
apostle of freedom, born in the Cas
tle of Steckelberg in 1488. I quote
from pages 235-G;
"Elrich von Hutton, on his Sick- 1
bed at Ebernburg, not far away, j
was full of wrath at the trial of j
Luther (at the Diet of Worms). |
'Away!' he shouted, 'away from the [
clear fountains, . . . Out of the sane- j
tuary, ye accursed peddlers! Touch j
no longer the altar with your de- |
secrating hands. What have ye to do
with the alms of our fathers, which j
were given for the poor and the
Church, and you spend for splen
dor, pomp, and foolery, while the i
children suffer for bread? See you
not that the wind of Freedom is [
blowing? (Sehet ihr nicht dass die j
Luft dcr Freiheit weht?) On two
men not much depends. Know that
there are many Luthers, many Ilut
lens here. Should either of us be,
destroyed, still greater is the danger I
that awaits you; for then, with those ;
battling for freedom, the avengers
of innocence will make common
cause.'"

Dear Elizabeth: j
Your review of "Morning Glory '
which appeared in last Monday's
Daily was very unsatisfactory as a |
competent discussion of that mov
ing picture.
When I read a review of a local
cinema I expect, first of all, to get i'
some sort of a hint as to whether
the subject discussed is worth my j

! two-bits and chiefly whether it is
worth my time (which always ap
pears most valuable when it has
i been wasted). And when I find in
j a review a lot of flippant, unquali
fied statements I'm worse off than
when I started (time wasted). I am
stili worse off when in said review
j there appears to be no concept of
I the psychological and philosophical
I importance of the subject.
Perhaps I a in- in error as to the
i function of a good review. I
doubt it. Shouldn't the space al
lotted be filled with well organ
ized factual comment which might
influence the reader's desire to
experience the subject? Yours
I gives no such aid. Only once, in
directly at that, did you suggest
one see "Morning Glory" when
j you noted the "best shot in the
picture."
And just what is "unique treat
ment of an old story"? You hit this
' last with a few points of relatively
I pea-sized importance: staging, mi
nor characters, and other detail—
the elements of the "new twist."
| Blah!
| The new twist was mostly in
! Hepburn's acting. And what is act
i ing? It is not mere physical per
! sonality riding on a story as a "ve
hicle." Acting is interpretation of
: the story. So is directing! That's ob
; vious enough. The reason that Hep-
I burn was so good was that she
I understood the character of Eva
| Lovelace and expressed it almost
; perfectly in her acting.
I don't remember when I read
your review before this last. The
subjects I remember neither. But
I retain the impression that you
were capable. No doubt you have
felt that way about your stuff or
you wouldn't let yourself become
lackadaisical and shallow.
This "Morning Glory" review
showed me something. It appears
that you are well informed about
the dramatic world: actors' names,
directors, successes, traditional stu
pidities, etc. You also would seem
well grounded in and capable of
criticising all expressions of all as
pects of life. And you should be
commended. For even if you are
barely twenty or so, it marks you
as being exceptionally mature men
tally, a rare quality in adolescent
"activity life" at Stanford.

Dear Elizabeth: j
Your review of "Morning Glory '
which appeared in last Monday's
Daily was very unsatisfactory as a |
competent discussion of that mov
ing picture.
When I read a review of a local
cinema I expect, first of all, to get i'
some sort of a hint as to whether
the subject discussed is worth my j

! two-bits and chiefly whether it is
worth my time (which always ap
pears most valuable when it has
i been wasted). And when I find in
j a review a lot of flippant, unquali
fied statements I'm worse off than
when I started (time wasted). I am
stili worse off when in said review
j there appears to be no concept of
I the psychological and philosophical
I importance of the subject.
Perhaps I a in- in error as to the
i function of a good review. I
doubt it. Shouldn't the space al
lotted be filled with well organ
ized factual comment which might
influence the reader's desire to
experience the subject? Yours
I gives no such aid. Only once, in
directly at that, did you suggest
one see "Morning Glory" when
j you noted the "best shot in the
picture."
And just what is "unique treat
ment of an old story"? You hit this
' last with a few points of relatively
I pea-sized importance: staging, mi
nor characters, and other detail—
the elements of the "new twist."
| Blah!
| The new twist was mostly in
! Hepburn's acting. And what is act
i ing? It is not mere physical per
! sonality riding on a story as a "ve
hicle." Acting is interpretation of
: the story. So is directing! That's ob
; vious enough. The reason that Hep-
I burn was so good was that she
I understood the character of Eva
| Lovelace and expressed it almost
; perfectly in her acting.
I don't remember when I read
your review before this last. The
subjects I remember neither. But
I retain the impression that you
were capable. No doubt you have
felt that way about your stuff or
you wouldn't let yourself become
lackadaisical and shallow.
This "Morning Glory" review
showed me something. It appears
that you are well informed about
the dramatic world: actors' names,
directors, successes, traditional stu
pidities, etc. You also would seem
well grounded in and capable of
criticising all expressions of all as
pects of life. And you should be
commended. For even if you are
barely twenty or so, it marks you
as being exceptionally mature men
tally, a rare quality in adolescent
"activity life" at Stanford.
Sincerely,

The Editor, Sir:
In recent translations of our
motto, I note, "Luft" is taken as
plural (which would be "Lufte"), j
and I wonder if students who cher
ish this motto would not appreciate
a glimpse of the context from which
it was taken, together with a refer- |
ence to a book that will acquaint |
them with a phase of Dr. Jordan's!
gteatness aside from what they hear
on his building of Stanford, his emi- |
nence in the science of zoology, and J
his services on the seal commission.
"The Story of the Innumerable ;
Company, and Other Sketches," by i
David Starr Jordan, 1896, San Fran- j
cisco: Whitaker Ray Co., 294 pp., is
the book. The sixth sketch is "A
Knight of the Order of Poets" (pp.
207-224), the self-chosen title of an ;
apostle of freedom, born in the Cas
tle of Steckelberg in 1488. I quote
from pages 235-G;
"Elrich von Hutton, on his Sick- 1
bed at Ebernburg, not far away, j
was full of wrath at the trial of j
Luther (at the Diet of Worms). |
'Away!' he shouted, 'away from the [
clear fountains, . . . Out of the sane- j
tuary, ye accursed peddlers! Touch j
no longer the altar with your de- |
secrating hands. What have ye to do
with the alms of our fathers, which j
were given for the poor and the

nor characters, and other detail—
the elements of the "new twist."
| Blah!
| The new twist was mostly in
! Hepburn's acting. And what is act
i ing? It is not mere physical per
! sonality riding on a story as a "ve
hicle." Acting is interpretation of
: the story. So is directing! That's ob
; vious enough. The reason that Hep-
I burn was so good was that she

I don't remember when I read
your review before this last. The
subjects I remember neither. But
I retain the impression that you
were capable. No doubt you have
felt that way about your stuff or
you wouldn't let yourself become
lackadaisical and shallow.
This "Morning Glory" review
showed me something. It appears
that you are well informed about
the dramatic world: actors' names,
directors, successes, traditional stu
pidities, etc. You also would seem
well grounded in and capable of
criticising all expressions of all as
pects of life. And you should be
commended. For even if you are
barely twenty or so, it marks you
as being exceptionally mature men
tally, a rare quality in adolescent
"activity life" at Stanford.

The Editor, Sir:
In recent translations of our
motto, I note, "Luft" is taken as
plural (which would be "Lufte"), j
and I wonder if students who cher
ish this motto would not appreciate
a glimpse of the context from which
it was taken, together with a refer- |
ence to a book that will acquaint |
them with a phase of Dr. Jordan's!
gteatness aside from what they hear
on his building of Stanford, his emi- |
nence in the science of zoology, and J
his services on the seal commission.
"The Story of the Innumerable ;
Company, and Other Sketches," by i
David Starr Jordan, 1896, San Fran- j
cisco: Whitaker Ray Co., 294 pp., is
the book. The sixth sketch is "A
Knight of the Order of Poets" (pp.
207-224), the self-chosen title of an ;
apostle of freedom, born in the Cas
tle of Steckelberg in 1488. I quote
from pages 235-G;
"Elrich von Hutton, on his Sick- 1
bed at Ebernburg, not far away, j
was full of wrath at the trial of j
Luther (at the Diet of Worms). |
'Away!' he shouted, 'away from the [
clear fountains, . . . Out of the sane- j
tuary, ye accursed peddlers! Touch j
no longer the altar with your de- |
secrating hands. What have ye to do
with the alms of our fathers, which j
were given for the poor and the
Church, and you spend for splen
dor, pomp, and foolery, while the i
children suffer for bread? See you
not that the wind of Freedom is [
blowing? (Sehet ihr nicht dass die j
Luft dcr Freiheit weht?) On two
men not much depends. Know that
there are many Luthers, many Ilut
lens here. Should either of us be,
destroyed, still greater is the danger I
that awaits you; for then, with those ;
battling for freedom, the avengers
of innocence will make common
cause.'"

Dear Elizabeth: j
Your review of "Morning Glory '
which appeared in last Monday's
Daily was very unsatisfactory as a |
competent discussion of that mov
ing picture.
When I read a review of a local
cinema I expect, first of all, to get i'
some sort of a hint as to whether
the subject discussed is worth my j

! two-bits and chiefly whether it is
worth my time (which always ap
pears most valuable when it has
i been wasted). And when I find in
j a review a lot of flippant, unquali
fied statements I'm worse off than
when I started (time wasted). I am
stili worse off when in said review
j there appears to be no concept of
I the psychological and philosophical
I importance of the subject.
Perhaps I a in- in error as to the
i function of a good review. I
doubt it. Shouldn't the space al
lotted be filled with well organ
ized factual comment which might
influence the reader's desire to
experience the subject? Yours
I gives no such aid. Only once, in
directly at that, did you suggest
one see "Morning Glory" when
j you noted the "best shot in the
picture."
And just what is "unique treat
ment of an old story"? You hit this
' last with a few points of relatively
I pea-sized importance: staging, mi
nor characters, and other detail—
the elements of the "new twist."
