# Washingtonians Must Wait While School Hymn Sung
## 
### 
At the University of Washington
the alumni are co-operating with
j the Bib "W" Club members in see
ing that Washington graduates do 1
not leave their seats at football |
games before the singing of the
hymn.
Boos will greet all student spec
tators who leave early, and the
committee will take it into their i
hands to supervise Washingtonians
and keep them in the stands until
! "Alma Mater" is sung.
