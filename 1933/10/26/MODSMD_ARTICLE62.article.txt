## THE
						BUTLER GHOST WALKETH AGAIN 
### 
We see by the papers from the
north that the University of Wash
ington Daily is raising the grimy
spectre of collegiate proselyting of
{.thletes again. The gist of the mat
ter is a resurrection of the famed
Butler report. You will no doubt
remember the Butler Report. The
Pacific Coast Conference paid a lot
of money to have its aberrations
from the straight and narrow path
properly rationalized. Anyone who
was sufficiently demented to plough
through the interminable thing
found out that what he knew al
ready existed was fair enough. It
was a case of "Everybody's doing it,"
and anyway, why not?
Stanford, declares the U. of W.
Daily, peering into the Rutler opus,
was reported to have loaned Stan
ford athletes money ''in some sur
reptitious manlier," to care for
their tuition.
Quoting: "In 1931-32, 98 Stanford
athletes were granted tuition loans
aggregating $1tj,020. Forty-one of
these athletes were made loans for
the tuition of one quarter only,
while 57 were granted loans for two
or more quarters during the year.
During 1931-32, the total amount
loaned by the University to all stu
dents on tuition charges was $92,-
210. The amount loaned to athletes
is 18 per cent of the total amount
loaned to students."
Probably true, but hardly start
ling.

"I've got a tuition note from the
Dean's office, Tiny. How about
putting ine in there at halfback
against U.S.C.? Or I would he
willing to try out in the Washing
ton game, just for a starter."
"Yeah," says Nevers. "The kid's
all right, Tiny. Hasn't he got a tui
tion note? Kick, pass, run the ends,
hit the line and a demon on de
len.se."
