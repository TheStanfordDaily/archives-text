# EL TROJAN IS PHILOSOPHICAL CUSS
## 
### 
A columnist in the Southern Cali
fornia Daily Trojan has decided that
their 0-0 game will be an advantage
to the Trojans. He lists end of wor
ry about the winning streak buga
boo, end of bragging by U.S.C.'s
friends, players will be in a position
to really bear down on California,
and there will be more interest in
the U.C. game.
As liabilities El Trojan has the
end of a good winning streak of 25
games; and a weakened grip on the
national championship.
—o —
The biggest Trojan loss strikes us
as being Rosy Rosenberg who has
sustained a broken jaw. If it's as
severe as Bob Hamilton's hurt, the
big Trojan guard will be out for at
least a month, and that won't be
such a big help. Julie Bescos, the left
end, is also on the ailing list, with
a bad shoulder. —Hamilton
