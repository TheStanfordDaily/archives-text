# TENNIS TEAM WINS NATIONAL TROPHY WITH YALE SECOND
## 
### 
After 15 years of striving, with
important victories chalked up
every year since 1921, Stanford
leads the Intercollegiate world in
tennis.
Official notification came from
Philadelphia yesterday. Joe Cough
lin, '33 captain, and unusual Card
netman, received the important com
munication, which is soon to be fol
lowed by the coveted Intercollegiate
trophy.
Point for point, year after year
went Cardinal athletes back East to
represent Stanford in the college
classic for tennis men. Then started
the mighty dynasty of powerful
Stanford net teams in 1921, which
has continued up to this summer
when sophomore Sam Lee and cagey
Joe Coughlin for the second year
stowed away the doubles crown.
Remarkable thing is the fact that
by no means has this era of out
standing netmen passed. Card sup
porters are amazed by the abun
dance of newly-entered tennis-play
ing prospects. Law, Dey, and Seward
will go down in Stanford tennis his
tory before they are graduated.
Two-Time Winners
Lion's share of point garnering
goes to Keith Gledhill and Joe
Coughlin, brilliant players. In '31
Gledhill won Intercollegiate singles,
next year the double title, paired
with Coughlin. Then in 1933 Cough
lin paired with Sammy Lee formed
a flawless combination.
Both men started their tennis sea
son with the avowed intention of
cinching the cup, practiced all year
for that one tourney, went back
East, and played invincible doubles,
justifying their high seeding.
In 1921 Phil Neer won the singles
crown, in '22 Neer and Davies the
doubles. In '25 Blonde Cranston
Holman, now practicing physician,
was runner-up in the singles duel.
In 1928 McElwain and Herrington
won the doubles, and players now
on the Farm won the retaining
points.
Stanford Has Seven Points
Curious is the fact that delay of
conferring the trophy upon Stanford
lay in the confirming of Holman's
two wins in '25 and '26. They were
the margin that brings the cup to
the Stanford Trophy room.
College points were: Stanford 7,
Yale 5 1 /?, Texas U. 5V 2 , U.C. 5; show
ing closeness of .the battle since 1919.
A contest for a new trophy will be
gin next year.
