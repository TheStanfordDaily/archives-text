### 
Seldom speaking, quiet Howard
Jones of Southern California locked
ihe gates this week at Bovard Field,
then gave vent to his feelings on
the subject of over-confidence.
The Associated Press reported
Jones as saying, "I have a big squad,
| ana can pick understudies for all
jobs from among the ranks.
"I would rather lose doing so
Ihnn put an over-confident, swag
gering team on the field. I look
i for the toughest game we have
had in two years next Saturday at
Berkeley, I know that Ingram has
a large squad of big powerful men
and that all his cripples are now
in shape and ready to go.
"I have tried to impress the boys
that the Bears are just as good as
theyâ€”have no complexes and cer
tainly are always prepared to put
their best game up against us."
