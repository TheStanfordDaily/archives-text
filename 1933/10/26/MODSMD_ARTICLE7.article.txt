Fear of contractors that NRA
sponsored public works construction
would be tied up by labor strife
was partially dispelled yesterday.
Occasion was a preliminary hear
ing on master code for strike-torn,
racket-ridden building trades. Ex-
peclation was that wages could be

J industry could so easily adjust its
differences.

NRA officials. A few samples: Gar
i ment manufacturer, working girls
overtime, supplied same with wed
ding rings so they could pose as
bosses' wives when investigators
I looked in. One Theodore Kohn,

! ting his hair for 35 cents—3o cents
i under code price.
