# FROSH POINT FOR HARD GAME WITH BRONC GRID TEAM
## 
### 
With the powerful Santa Clara
i frosh eleven scheduled as their op
ponent, Coach Jimmie Bradshaw
i rnd his yearling gridders are
paiing for one of the hardest games
of their season Saturday, with all
due respect to the fact that S.C.
and California are also included
among Stanford's freshmen adver-
I saries.
Where there are varsities of the
caliber of Santa Clara's, there also
must be good freshman teams and
that is just what the Colts are, ac
icoiding to all reports. Last Satur
-1 day Coach Bradshaw journeyed
down to Fresno to see them mas
; sacre the Fresno State frosh by
i some five or six touchdowns to
nothing. ,
Santa Clara Strong
Returning, he brought news of a
big, rough Santa Clara outfit that
will give the Babes all the oppo
sition that they are likely to care
i for Saturday afternoon. It seems
1 that the Colts are determined to do
everything to Stanford that their
varsity failed to accomplish some
I three weeks ago.
Injuries, some slight, some doubt
ful, continue to handicap the frosh.
Captain Dale Beedle was on the
injured list last night, not turning
out for practice. Jack Geisen and
Joe Vigna, who is still troubled by
a bad knee, were also among the
disabled.
Passing Stressed
. Chuck Ledbetter, with his right
; hand in a cast, was still able to wig
i gle his fingers well enough to toss
passes and carry the ball on his
line-devastating smashes. Fred Wil
i liams, goal kicker, passer, and ball
i carrier extraordinary, spent a good
part of last night's session throwing
passes to ends Schott, Chouteau,
Reynolds, Elder, and Jenkins, indi
cating that the aerial game will see
some service Saturday.
Contrary to previous announce
ment, the San Jose State freshmen
will not be played until the week
after the Santa Clara contest, com
ing as a breather before the Little
Big Game with California.

i London — A music hall of two
thousand years ago has been ex
cavated at St. Albans.
With the powerful Santa Clara
i frosh eleven scheduled as their op
ponent, Coach Jimmie Bradshaw
i rnd his yearling gridders are
paiing for one of the hardest games
of their season Saturday, with all
due respect to the fact that S.C.
and California are also included
among Stanford's freshmen adver-
I saries.
Where there are varsities of the
caliber of Santa Clara's, there also
must be good freshman teams and
that is just what the Colts are, ac
icoiding to all reports. Last Satur
-1 day Coach Bradshaw journeyed
down to Fresno to see them mas
; sacre the Fresno State frosh by
i some five or six touchdowns to
nothing. ,
Santa Clara Strong
Returning, he brought news of a
big, rough Santa Clara outfit that
will give the Babes all the oppo
sition that they are likely to care
i for Saturday afternoon. It seems
1 that the Colts are determined to do
everything to Stanford that their
varsity failed to accomplish some
I three weeks ago.
Injuries, some slight, some doubt
ful, continue to handicap the frosh.
Captain Dale Beedle was on the
injured list last night, not turning
out for practice. Jack Geisen and
Joe Vigna, who is still troubled by
a bad knee, were also among the
disabled.
Passing Stressed
. Chuck Ledbetter, with his right
; hand in a cast, was still able to wig
i gle his fingers well enough to toss
passes and carry the ball on his
line-devastating smashes. Fred Wil
i liams, goal kicker, passer, and ball
i carrier extraordinary, spent a good
part of last night's session throwing
passes to ends Schott, Chouteau,
Reynolds, Elder, and Jenkins, indi
cating that the aerial game will see
some service Saturday.
Contrary to previous announce
ment, the San Jose State freshmen
will not be played until the week
after the Santa Clara contest, com
ing as a breather before the Little
Big Game with California.
