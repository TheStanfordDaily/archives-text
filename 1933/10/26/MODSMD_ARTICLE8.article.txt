# A.S.S.U. RULE IS UNDER FIRE AT WILBUR CONFAB
## Powers of Ex Committee In Drama, Publication Fields Need Clarifying ADMINISTRATION TALKS Wilbur, Yost, and Roth Give Views on Change 
### 
Possibly a preliminary to an A.S. !
S.U. Constitutional Convention, cer
i tainiy a delicious dinner-discussion
i —was last night's conference be- :
I tween Dr. Wilbur and campus !
I "leaders."
A week ago it was the councils j
1 (men's and women's) who journeyed [
up Lagunita Knoll. This time, it j
I was the Ex Committee, sundry other
I campus office holders, and a galaxy [
i of officials that went to the Presi- I
i dential manse. Included in the gal- ;
j r.xy were: Graduate Manager A1
I Masters; his A.S.S.U. ambassador,
Manager Hables; the two Deans, and
Comptroller Roth.
New Constitution Issue
Mass discussion centered around
; one issue: a new constitution for the
\ A.S.S.U. President Wilbur, veteran
of the first, chaos-born Stanford Ex
Committee, urged the need of a new
framework for student government. (
His epithet: "There is need for less
legislation and more constitution!"
Students agreed the present consti
tution was too complex, caused too j
many tangles.
Closely allied to the constitution |
comment was talk of erecting an
: Associated Men Students organiza
tion, similar to A.W.S., apart from
A.S.S.U. Mother of the idea. Dean
Yost suggested the new body could
I take care of all student functions 1
pertaining strictly to men: sponsor
system, athletics, mud fight, etc.

Roth Has Ideas
j Comptroller Roth had definite j
I ideas on the proposed A.M.S. Said |
i he: "Under the present set-up, it '
j looks like the women run their own
I affairs and have a hand in the men's
business as well." Roth told how
! the problem was settled when he
I was A.S.S.U. prexy: ihen there were
I no women on the Ex Committee.
| Feminists like Jeanne Millard
! frowned at the recollection.
Wilbur had further ideas: thought
the powers of the Ex Committee
should be well defined, cited am
biguities in dramatics and publi
cations, posed the question of
1 whether or not faculty journalism
head should have official advisory
capacity on the Daily.
Another Confab Slated
Last discussion topic: the "Prince
ton Plan" under which all student
work—hashing, laundry, agencies,
etc.—are handled through one office.
Third conference of the series v/ill
probably be held next week.
