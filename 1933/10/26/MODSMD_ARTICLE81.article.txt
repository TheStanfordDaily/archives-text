# DARKNESS STOPS SOCCER GAME WITH SAN MATEO
## 
### 
Misfortune interfered with Stan
ford's soccer varsity yesterday to
Jet San Mateo tie it 1 to 1 by a tiuke
seoie, in a queer game which termi
nated prematurely in darkness.
In the second quarter Jaysce for
wards, harassed by panting halfs,
drove the ball past Cy Johnson,
skilled left fullback, who deadened
its force but couldn't stop it. It
spun on toward Dick Strouse, right
full who played a fighting game, but
a fluke kick deflected it from the
waiting hands of goalie Jack Kin&
Score at the end of the half: Stan
ford 0, San Mateo 1.
Rally at Half
Blossoming out into better form
at the end of the first half, the In
dians monopolized the play, making
some goal threats which were broken
up in the last minute by an effec
tive Jaysee goalie, Carl Knecht, cap
tain, Art Hearn, Johnnie Moore,
Miguel Gomez, arid Chuck EmerictT
comprised the second quarter for
ward line which worked the San
Mateo defense up into a lather, i
Knecht and Moore played very well. 1
Moore it was who at the stai't of j
the last quarter retalliated for the
point and scored on a I
penalty kick. Given the goal chance j
after being fouled in the goalmouth,
Moore ingeniously faked the shot 1
toward the right corner, pivoted in j
the same movement while the goalie
jerked to the right, and booted the
ball exactly into the left corner.
Score: Stanford 1, San Mateo 1.
Darkness Is Handicap
Toward the end of the last quar- 1
ter, with the sun well on its way to j
baliChina, the field became so dark, |
the ball so inconspicuous, and the j
play so rough that the game was 1
called with seven minutes left un
played. Consent of both coaches, i
each recognizing the danger of noc- I
turnal sci immagings, ended the
third conference game leaving Stan- â– 
ford v/ith only a .500 standing.
Starting line-up was: forwards,
Gomez, Knecht, Hearn, Doddington, \
Emerick; halfbacks, Wh'ite, Moore,
Gonzales; fullbacks, Strouse, John- 1
son; goalie, King.
Substitutes in Last Half
At halftims Johnny Hitchcock |
went in at left half. White took cen- j
ter, and Moore displaced at right i
inside in the forward wall. With '
Gonzales injured in the third quar- ;
ler, Louis Bansbach replaced him.
Carl Krebs displaced Emerick in the
last quarter, and Milt Newman re- j
lieved King at goal after dark.
Hitchcock, Moore, Gonzales, and 1
White held down the halfback posts
well and King, in goal, made some 1
beautiful saves, especially on three ( '
dangerous corner kicks.
