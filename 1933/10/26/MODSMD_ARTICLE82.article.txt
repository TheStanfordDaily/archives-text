# CRITIC CLAIMS SHAW 'BEST HATED' WRITER
## 
### James Sandoe 
George Bernard Shaw, whose
"Arms and the Man" is to be pro
duced by (he Dramatic Council
under the direction of Harold Hel
venston on Friday evening, Novem
ber 3, is one of the most genuinely
hated of living men.
His tongue is sharp and employed
unsparingly. One instance of his
acidity was his demand that the
program for "The Chocolate Sol
dier include the admonition that
it was an "unauthorized parody of
one of Mr. Bernard Shaw's com
edies."
Oscar Wilde said of him, "Shaw
has no enemies and none of his i
friends like him." The grain of I
truth in the epigram lies in the /act
that few if any people who have
met Shaw have found him anything
but a charming and witty person; '
but, curiously enough, few estimates
of him come to the same conclu- !
sions in attempting to explain his
attitudes.
Perhaps Shaw himself, although i
a congenital performer, has sue- i
ceeded utterly in revealing himself.
Not in casual conversation nor in
his perpetual ideal-heckling, but. in
his voluminous prefaces which
serve not only as a key to the less I
obvious passages, but as Shaw's i
mouthpiece for a variety of opinions
upon almost every subject imagin
able.
His career has by no means been j
confined to playwriting; it was as a i
dramatic critic that he aroused
stoims of applause and fury before
he began to write plays; and his
political and economic hecklings
h.'.ve continued since his early Dub
lin days.
It was in these days that, unex
pectedly, he sought out, at the ad
vice of superior Social Democrats,
the "Capital" of Karl Marx. The
work was, at the time, available
only in the French version at ihe

British Museum. William Archer
tells of his amusement at finding
Shaw, "young and tawny," bending
j alternately over "Das Kapital" and
an 01 chestral score of "Tristan and
Isolde."
; Thus, even in youth, this curious
| blend of theories was to be dis- i

cerned—a blend which has resulted
in some of the most curious and .
perhaps — although we must wait'
some time to know—the best plays
of (he twentieth century. At any
1 ate, many of them are, it can
scarcely by denied, among the most
I entertaining.
