.
A drastic shakeup that saw five of
Ihc seven first-string linemen shift
ed back to the second team took
! place at Notre Dame yesterday.
Ed Krause and Tom Roach, tac
kles, lost their jobs to John Mi
, chuta of Detroit and Ken Stilley of
Johnstone, Pa. Harry Wiyisch and
' Joe Pivarnik, guards, were dis
i placed by Jim Leonard and Paul

Coach Ossie Solem was undecidcd
I today whether or not to hold fur
! titer scrimmages for Ihe lowa Uni
versity football team after Bill Seckl,
first team right guard, was carried
ofi the field with an injured leg.
For a time it was feared that 1
Seckl's leg was broken, but X-rays
showed the injury to be only a
severe bruise.

It s very handy for the Pennsyl
vania coaches to have LaSalle Col
lege near by when they are coming
up against a team which uses the
Notre Dame system. LaSalle is
coached by Marty Brill, who ran
wild against the Quakers in the
1930 Penn-Notre Dame game, and
he is willing to let his team scrim
mage against the big fellows.

I The boys from Cooper Union play j
; football under plenty of handicaps,
but they still play. The team does
not officially represent the school !
and receives no support from the 1
athletic funds. And now the word I
comes that it must be listed as
"Cooper Union Students" or the !
players are liable to be suspended
from college on the ground that i
they're claiming a position that 1
doesn't belong to them.
Whether or not Yale's hopes for a
j crowd of 60,000 for Saturday's game
with Army are fulfilled, it seems j
certain that the attendance will be j
greater than it was at last year's i
Yale-Army clash. The crowd was
only 35.000 and that many tickets
for Saturday's clash already have j
been sold.

sylvania families have solved the

the Pitt backfield, and Joe Weisen
