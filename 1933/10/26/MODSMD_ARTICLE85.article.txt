# CINDER MEN MUST BETTER RECORDS-- COACH TEMPLETON
## 
### 
Better marks will be turned in Lhis
week than those of last Friday—
or Coach Dink Tcmpleton will know
why not. This was his edict last
night, coming in the form of an an
nouncement of the second weekly
competitive meet among members
of his Indian track teams.
Orchids to Bud Deacon—most
consistent Stanford candidate of
the week. The high-minded red
. head has been clearing 12 feet (J
inches and l.'J feet with ease every
day so far—pretty fair pole vault
ing for the dreary fall season.
These Friday meets are important,
Templeton emphasizes. In lact he
stressed the fact to his proteges by
the remark that a Friday cut wiU
count as a cut for the entire week.
Phil Williams made his best broad
jump of the year yesterday —21
feet lIV 2 inches. The inclement
autumn is as hard on the broad
jump as on any other division.
Distance men continued cross
country meandering in the Wed
nesday workout.
Ben Eastman, graduate, believes
his leg will get back in shape
soon; he has been working out
daily. He probably will compete
with the Olympic Club in the |
spring. Abe Ilables, sprinting
Student Manager, also may run
for the clubmen. High - soaring
Bill Miller. Olympic Gaines cham
pion vaulter* has been in strips
twice this season; he gives evi
dence of matching Deacon in mi
nor meets.
