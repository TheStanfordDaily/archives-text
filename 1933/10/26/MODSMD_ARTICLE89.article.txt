Object of moot court is to give ,
students in the law school an op
portunity to argue cases, which while
being fictitious problems, are based
on law and give real practical expo- ]
rience in the art of the bar. Great
care is exercised in choosing a topic
so the law may be interpreted in
different ways and give both prose
cution and defense an equal shot at
victory.

At the Sequoia Hard Times Dance:
Lee Chapin, debate adviser, the
liickiest, tackiest looking of the
bunch. Farm clothes, farm hat, farm
demeanor.

Stanford coed speedsters darn
socks when they can't pay their
fines.
