# SOLUTION OF ARMS ISSUES DISCUSSED IN GUERARD TALK
## 
### 
Emphasizing the need to think
coolly about international affairs,
and to lay aside all dogma and elo
quence in efforts to persuade, Pro
lessor Albert Guerard appealed to
Stanford and Palo Alto citizens last
night to pursue an active intelligence
in relation to disarmament, repara
tions, war debts and other bones of
world contention threatening to lead
to another great war. The lecture
was given at the Palo Alto Commu
nity Forum last night.
There are two possible solutions
to the boundary and arms prob
lem, according to Professor Guer
ard: first, acceptance of the status
quo: second, collective armaments.
The fact that Germany yesterday
staled its desire to get back terri
tory in Poland which now belongs
to another country shows how far
nations are at present from an
intelligent acceptance of boundary
settlements as they arc.
Three main groups oppose the
theory of collective armaments: iso
lationists, ultra-Pacifists, and pro-
Germans. Peace by collective arma
ments is not impossible, vs. Boxer
Rebellion. It does imply, however,
the super-state.
Professor Guerard, before an
swering audience questions, quoted
three attitudes which might help to
solve the problem: Theodore Roose
velt's belief that international law
cannot exist without international
strength to enforce; Will Rogers' in
telligent comment that the League
of Nations did not have a chance
for it had no power, and that the
will to enforce peace is necessary;
and an editorial from the San Fran
cisco Chronicle which .said, in refer
ence to the cotton war: "Stop it, no
matter who's right!"
