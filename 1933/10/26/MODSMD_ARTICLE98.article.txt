## 
### 
"If you first don't succeed . .
After a number of unsuccessful
attempts to capture the "big game
of the sea"—the Marlin swordfish—
Herbert Hoover left Tuesday night
for San Pedro to "try, try again."'
At San Pedro he will join Los An
geles financier Willis L. Hole on his
yacht. "Sonoma." Other guests will
include former secretary of agri
culture, Arthur M. Hyde, W. L.
Honnold, Harvey Mudd, and Hoo
ver's secretary, Paul Sexton.

The porpoise, usually considered a
stupid creature, has a much larger
brt'in than a man.
