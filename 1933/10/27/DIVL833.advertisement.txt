The big bruiser has an 80-inch sweep: you slip
into it with the same feeling of comfort as when you
relax in a® big easy chair! Greatest coat for a long,
tedious motor trip you've ever seen! Raglan should
ers give you absolute freedom... the total absence of
buttons allows you to wrap it as loosely or as tightly
as you desire. And that soft camel's hair fabric
gives you plenty of warmth...without weightiness!
