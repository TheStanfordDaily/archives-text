# Co-Op Loses Business; $31,000 Diverted
## 
### 
i Some $31,000 was diverted from
, the Co-op to City and Paly mer
j chants through violation of con
! contracts by individual Co-op mcm
j bers. Co-op's all-seeing accountants
i checked over fraternity disburse
| ments, discovered this, but strangely
! enough are doing not much about it.
Reason: E. H. Ay res, manager, be
lieves in co-operation, persuasion.
Said Ayres, had the houses dealt
exclusively with Co-op they would
have saved each member $100, the
\ whole membership $3,000. A.s it was
the weary three thousand walked off
in the pockets of City and Paly mer
chants.
Reason: Total Co-op sales were
$100,000 handled at cost. The lost
$31,000 would have entailed little
additional cost to the Co-operative.
No enlargement of staff and very
little further distributing expense
would have been involved. Since
Ayres' surveys have convinced him
l Co-op sells with service at less price
than any competitors, since mer
chants sell for a profit while Co-op
returns its makings, contract-evad
ing members merely diverted profit
i from themselves to off-aempus mer
chants, raised their costs. A matter
!of cutting one's throat to slice a
grapefruit.
