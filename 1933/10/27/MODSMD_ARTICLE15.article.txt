# Washington Reserve Weak for Clash With Card Gridders
## Thornhill Expects Rainy Weather for Battle With Husky Warriors Tomorrow; Will Start With Usual First-String Line-Up 
### SPUD HAMILTON 
While Jimmy IMielan, the windy-voiced man from the Big Ten, was
laboriously polishing his offense in Seattle yesterday, 33 Stanford foot
ballers slipped aboard one of the Southern Pacific's best models, bound
for Seattle, Phelan, and the Washington Huskies. The Northerners are
not reticent; they admit that they will show Stanford more offensive punch
tomorrow than the Indians have seen all year.

Washington, who started out
season with the best hopes for a |
.conference winner in years, sud- '
denly woke up to find themselves
without much in the way of re- j
serves; Phelan started shifting men '
around like a chess game, and the j
next he knew Oregon had sneaked j
up and knocked his "queen's pawn
opening" for a row of bishops. And j
(hereby went hopes of a conference i
winner.
First String Good
Lack of reserves not withstanding, [
they have a good set of first string
ers at Seattle, and Oregon State in I
their last two games well demon
stratcd that you don't need a bat- j
talion to win a football game. Phe- j '
lan has made his center, Hurley De j :
Fvoin, into a halfback, and he will
probably start tomorrow with the :
veteran Matt Muczynski playing i
right half.
Jay Hornbeck will open the game j
at quarter, with Paul Sulkosky at j :
fullback. The brunt of the offense j
will lie with Muczynski, but Phe- '

lan' will have an ace in the hole in
the form of Art Ahonen, veteran
triple-threat man. Ahonen will en
ter the game at critical moments to
lend the Husky backfield its most
potent offensive charge.
In the line Phelan has two men
of note—Joe Wiatrik at tackle, and
an end with the commonplace
name of Bill Smith. Common in
name is Smith, but he is deucedly
uncommon in playing ability, and
at the season's start was expected
to lead the coast with Captain
Ford Palmer of the Trojans for a
running mate. Smith, Moscrip,
and Norgard will make a three
way fight for end play honors in
this game.
Weather Uncertain
With weather conditions most un
settled in Seattle—snow one day,
rain the next, slush the next—no
one knows whether tomorrow will
be fair and shining or not fit for
man or beast. Stanford teams have
fared badly in the North, according
to history, but Tiny Thornhill has
indicated that he is prepared for
rain.
The wet won't do those formation
"A" reverses, and the forward
passes, and the laterals any good,
but this year Stanford has the sin
gle wingback formation "C" to fall
back upon. It. was probably not
Ernie Nevers' and Thomhill's inten
tion "C" just for use at. Seattle, but
Ihe simple plays from that set, and
the wet weather ought to make a
lu.ppy combination.
Hamilton Ready
Bob Hamilton will be ready for
use tomorrow, and there are a good
many competent critics who feel
that the presence of Hamilton in
the game will make a lot of dif
ference in the way Stanford clicks.
There are just as many more who
will welcome the appearance of
Woody Adams and Larry Rouble
at guards, when these lads get in
the game again.
Bobby Grayson worked out with
the team before they left yesterday,
and using a wet ball made him feel
right at home. Grayson did his prep
school playing in Portland and the
old soggy leather seems natural. He
was passing the wet ball better than
a dry one yesterday.
Thornhill expects to start his
usual first string combination,
with Jack Drown getting (lie call
over slightly injured Bob Rey
nolds at left tacklc. Drown is a
big red-haired kid who plays
tackle with all the fire that natu
rally goes with the job, and he
has done dependable work so far.

Washington, who started out
season with the best hopes for a |
.conference winner in years, sud- '
denly woke up to find themselves
without much in the way of re- j
serves; Phelan started shifting men '
around like a chess game, and the j
next he knew Oregon had sneaked j
up and knocked his "queen's pawn
opening" for a row of bishops. And j
(hereby went hopes of a conference i
winner.
First String Good
Lack of reserves not withstanding, [
they have a good set of first string
ers at Seattle, and Oregon State in I
their last two games well demon
stratcd that you don't need a bat- j
talion to win a football game. Phe- j '
lan has made his center, Hurley De j :
Fvoin, into a halfback, and he will
probably start tomorrow with the :
veteran Matt Muczynski playing i
right half.
Jay Hornbeck will open the game j
at quarter, with Paul Sulkosky at j :
fullback. The brunt of the offense j
will lie with Muczynski, but Phe- '

lan' will have an ace in the hole in
the form of Art Ahonen, veteran
triple-threat man. Ahonen will en
ter the game at critical moments to
lend the Husky backfield its most
potent offensive charge.
In the line Phelan has two men
of note—Joe Wiatrik at tackle, and
an end with the commonplace
name of Bill Smith. Common in
name is Smith, but he is deucedly
uncommon in playing ability, and
at the season's start was expected
to lead the coast with Captain
Ford Palmer of the Trojans for a
running mate. Smith, Moscrip,
and Norgard will make a three
way fight for end play honors in
this game.
Weather Uncertain
With weather conditions most un
settled in Seattle—snow one day,
rain the next, slush the next—no
one knows whether tomorrow will
be fair and shining or not fit for
man or beast. Stanford teams have
fared badly in the North, according
to history, but Tiny Thornhill has
indicated that he is prepared for
rain.
The wet won't do those formation
"A" reverses, and the forward
passes, and the laterals any good,
but this year Stanford has the sin
gle wingback formation "C" to fall
back upon. It. was probably not
Ernie Nevers' and Thomhill's inten
tion "C" just for use at. Seattle, but
Ihe simple plays from that set, and
the wet weather ought to make a
lu.ppy combination.
Hamilton Ready
Bob Hamilton will be ready for
use tomorrow, and there are a good
many competent critics who feel
that the presence of Hamilton in
the game will make a lot of dif
ference in the way Stanford clicks.
There are just as many more who
will welcome the appearance of
Woody Adams and Larry Rouble
at guards, when these lads get in
the game again.
Bobby Grayson worked out with
the team before they left yesterday,
and using a wet ball made him feel
right at home. Grayson did his prep
school playing in Portland and the
old soggy leather seems natural. He
was passing the wet ball better than
a dry one yesterday.
Thornhill expects to start his
usual first string combination,
with Jack Drown getting (lie call
over slightly injured Bob Rey
nolds at left tacklc. Drown is a
big red-haired kid who plays
tackle with all the fire that natu
rally goes with the job, and he
has done dependable work so far.
While Jimmy IMielan, the windy-voiced man from the Big Ten, was
laboriously polishing his offense in Seattle yesterday, 33 Stanford foot
ballers slipped aboard one of the Southern Pacific's best models, bound
for Seattle, Phelan, and the Washington Huskies. The Northerners are
not reticent; they admit that they will show Stanford more offensive punch
tomorrow than the Indians have seen all year.
