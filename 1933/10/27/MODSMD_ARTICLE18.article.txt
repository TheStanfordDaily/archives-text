# Tryouts On Today For Air Debate
## N.B.C. Demands Names Of Radio Debaters 
### Frank Moore 
An intense .unique session of try
outs must be held this afternoon
for the Stanford-Cambridge Radio
Debate, Debate Adviser Lee Chapin
suddenly announced yesterday.
Whether or not the procedure
seems rash, it cannot be avoided.
National Broadcasting Company
yesterday phoned Public Speaking
Division Head Lee Emerson Bas
sett. Said radio's representative,
"We must have the names of both
teams by Tuesday at the latest. Our
publicity department cannot wait.
Said Speech's Bassett, "We will se
lect the team by Tuesday."
Ten Will Be Chosen
Ten men will be chosen today by
Adviser Chapin. Two men will be
selected Monday as the Stanford
team by a committee of three
judges.
Today's Little Theatre procedure
will start at 4 o'clock, continue into
the evening until finished. Instead
of speaking from the rostrum, each
man will give his five-minute talk
obscured from his auditors by stage
drops. Purpose of obscuring the
speakers from vision is to simulate!
as nearly as possible, the radio sit
uation of the unseen audience â€”un-
seen speaker.
Aspirants today will talk on the
debate subject: "Resolved, that the
political salvation of the world lies
in democracy rather than in dic
tatorship. The Daily erred in stat
ing Stanford will argue the affirma
tive. Stanford will argue the nega
tive.
Unlike the long harangues which
debaters fling at auditorium audi
ences, the radio talks will be short,
concise, pointed. Four men and the
chairmen must talk into the micro
phone within half an hour and no
seconds overtime allowed. Reason
for brevity: the tremendous cost of
domestic and foreign broadcasting,
transatlantic transmission.
Contest Uncertain
Anything but certain, today's
contest may discover a dark horse
from undergraduate ranks or bring
to the fore graduate talent rapidly
forgotten by the rapidly changing
student body. Thirty men have sig
nified their intentions to speak.
Among the old guard is Daniel
Bryant, '31, who traveled to Ha
waii, talked for Stanford in a trip
unknown to most present under
graduates. Also from the same class
is Isadorc Bodasof, member of the
1931 Joffre team. Joe Fessio, repre
sentative of last year's team
strength, has also promised to ap
pear. Comparatively unknown in
debating circles, Phi Beta Kappa,
shot-putter John Lyman has thrown
his hat in the ring.
