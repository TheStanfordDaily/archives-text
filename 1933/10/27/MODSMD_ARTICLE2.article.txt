# Strike Set Over
## 
### 
The California cotton strike is
over and the wage scale is 75 cents
a 100 pounds IF (say the workers)
union men are employed, jailed
strikers are released and armed
forces are withdrawn. Inasmuch as
the strikers are all to be turned out
into the road and run out of the
country if they don't go back to
work no difficulties are expected.
