date. San Francisco's mayor, An
gclo Rossi, and his wife accompanied
the Marconis.
II Duce's notables were greeted
on their campus arrival by Presi
dent and Mrs. Wilbur and Comp
troller Roth. While here the party
journeyed up San Juan Hill to pay
a visit to Mrs. Hoover. They were
taken through Ihe Memorial Church
and shown the campus dormitories.
After leaving the campus they
were entertained at a luncheon
given at Santa Clara University.
Co-honored with the Marconis was
Rev. Richard Bell, S.J., who while
a priest at San Jose some thirty
years ago is said to have sent the
first wireless message on the Pacific
Coast.
Leaving Santa Clara, the distin
