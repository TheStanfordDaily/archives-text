# Stanford Income Drops; Bonds Default Interest
## 
### Crompton Bangs, Jr 
Hard-working, enterprising Stan
ford students pay one-third their
University's expenses; returns from
investments do the rest. Four years
of hard times meant fewer $114
checks, greatly reduced income.
Result: the spo became the 800;
registration is closer to normal. But
the late depression has been just as
hard on securities, backbone of
Stanford's endowment.
11 Million in Industrials
With 45 million dollars, the cam
pus is fifth richest in U.S., most
opulent west of Chicago. One
fourth of the stake is the educa
tional plant, produces no income,
plenty of expense. The rest does its
share and more, made nearly two
million last year, has done better,
might easily do worse. Thirty-one
millions in widely assorted bonds
are a big job to take care of, re
quire careful watching. Industrials
head the list with a round 11 mil
lion, railroads and public utilities
follow with 8 million each, oil and
buildings have a million each, street
railway and foreign governments

about $700,000 per, federal and state
securities amount to $70,000, bring
up the rear of the procession.
Bad Bonds Reduce Income
The epidemic of defaulted bonds,
omitted dividends, did not miss the
University. Over a million in bonds
is in default at present, income is
thus reduced about $70,000 yearly.
I A few more defaults appear inevi
! table but some bonds, defaulted last
1 year, have worked out 0.K., now
j pay interest, balance things up. Net
return for the current year was
; 4.0.5 per cent, for last year 4.30 per
cent, for 1931, 4.73 per cent —this
| due mainly to omitted interest pay-
I merits—means a loss of close to
$100,000 in last three years because
of lower returns. Probable total
i loss: $170,000.
University is forbidden by found
ing Riant to invest in stocks, thus
I secure higher returns. But income
| is relatively more stable than stock -
investing Yale and Harvard, whose
holdings, way up in '29, are even
now way down, as are returns due

Hard-working, enterprising Stan
ford students pay one-third their
University's expenses; returns from
investments do the rest. Four years
of hard times meant fewer $114
checks, greatly reduced income.
Result: the spo became the 800;
registration is closer to normal. But
the late depression has been just as
hard on securities, backbone of
Stanford's endowment.
11 Million in Industrials
With 45 million dollars, the cam
pus is fifth richest in U.S., most
opulent west of Chicago. One
fourth of the stake is the educa
tional plant, produces no income,
plenty of expense. The rest does its
share and more, made nearly two
million last year, has done better,
might easily do worse. Thirty-one
millions in widely assorted bonds
