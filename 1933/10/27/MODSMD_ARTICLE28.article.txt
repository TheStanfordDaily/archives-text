## Point Raised Pre-maturely Campus Sentiment

Leading Stanford women were at j
' first perplexed, then indignant over i
the editorial concerning the new!
i women and the sorority problem ap- j
pearing in yesterday's Daily.
"Problem Magnified"
Jeanne Millard, president of the
j Associated Women Students, when
contacted at the Conference Party,
I stated, "I think the 'problem' has
been greatly magnified by bad sta
tistical procedure arid sensational !
journalism. Changes will be evolu- |
tionary, not revolutionary. There is ]
! absolutely no reason why a hall girl
! should feel inferior; in many ways
her position is more desirable than
that of her Greek sister."
Said Marian Parker, president of
Roble Club: "Naturally the influx
{ of new women has created problems
; this year which never before arose
on the Stanford campus. Major
among them is the housing prob
lem. To demand the immediate so
lution of a question involving the
happiness of a number of women is
! asking the administration to move i
| mountains."
"Is it, after all, indicative of stu
dent intelligence to force action on
such an issue as only time and ob-
I servation can afford satisfactory
j criteria?"
Mary Rath, president of Pan
llellenic, declared: "You can't solve j
the problem right away. The women |
have to adjust themselves. Sorori- j
tics can expand and expansion is I
the temporary solution. This year
is a trial year. It is unfortunate
l that the question was brought up
j now. It puts such a problem into
the minds of the freshman at the
wrong time. Rushing rules are on
trial this year. If necessary they
i will be revised next year."
Justine Jankowsky spoke for the
Union Club Executive Committee:
i "We believe that our social organi
zation offers the .small living group
advantages of intimate contacts and
early adjustments plus the unre
| strained social contacts of those
[small groups incorporated as the
Union Club."
Other key members in the cam
pus set-up were contacted, refused
to be quoted.
