# Oregon Quits Bonfire For Fireworks Display
## 
### 
The University of Oregon plans to
replace their annual freshman bon
fire held during Homecoming Week
by a display of fireworks. A mass
parade and rally will be substituted
for their customary noise fest.
Stanford University has abolished
its freshman bonfire this year, but
has not replaced it as yet by any
other activity.
