# Dobbs Found; Denies Kidnap
## 
### 
Appearance of Barrett Willoughby
Dobbs, '35, at his Burlingame home
late Wednesday night dispelled all
rumors that he had been kidnapped
or waylaid.
When the youth, son of Hugh
Barrett Dobbs, of radio fame, failed
to appear at Stanford Monday and
also failed to appear at his home
that evening and Tuesday, his par
ents notified San Francisco police.
Wednesday morning Dobbs' car was
found deserted in San Francisco.
Last night Mrs. Dobbs said that
her son had returned Wednesday
but offered no suggestion as to the
nature of his disappearance. Dobbs
will not return to his Stanford
classes for a few days, she said.
