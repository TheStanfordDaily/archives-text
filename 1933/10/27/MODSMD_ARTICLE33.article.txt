# No Railings Broken So Frosh Refund Mounts
## 
### 
The breakage refund to Encina
! residents will probably be greater
this year than last. Reason: itv prep
aration for the Cal raid on the last
bonfire, frosh kicked out railings on
I stairways to use as clubs. Many of
' the offenders were caught by ever
| watchful sponsors. These paid $1
| each for ever railing kicked out.
! Many offenders escaped. The cost
j of new railings was paid out of the
I Encina breakage fund.
