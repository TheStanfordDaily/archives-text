# Faced with a Situation
## 
### 
Faced with a situation, the campus women leaders con-
Incted, ([noted on the front page, do a perfect about-face
tlins completely solving the situation by the simple process
of evading it.
It is easy to evade because the problem is it quarter
away. Anything that far awav can be evaded. Hut evasion
will not solve the problem. It will only make it more dilli
cult when it ships women leaders in the face, instead of,
as now, calling loudly to them from the horizon. Hut evi
dently not loudly enough.
It is not a question of the advantages of Row over Hall
or vice-versa. Honeyed words proving that either is just
as good (or better than the other) do not meet the situa
tion. Pious hopes about vague generalities will not solve
the problem.
The experience of the years shows that a certain num
ber of women desire to live in a certain corner of the
campus. That number is greater this year, greater bv far.
Only it certain number of women can at present live in that
corner. Those that cannot get in will be disappointed.
They will be disappointed though thev may be bettered by
having lost out in the mad scramble.
That disappointment should be prevented. It can be
pr< â€¢vented. Hut bold action is necessary.
