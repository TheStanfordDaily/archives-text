Twelve students on this campus are high and dry as
far as being members of the student body is concerned;
they loaned student body cards to friends as a favor to
them in an effort to get them bv the gate at the San Fran
cisco I'niversily-Stanford football game Saturday.
The Daily is sorrv that they failed to realize the seri
ousness of their little acts of graciousncss, and at the same
time it hopes that they will be an example to others who
have gotten away with the trick or may think of doing it
in the future.
Hack in our grammar school days, the marble players
used to chant, "('.heaters never win," when some kid would
use a ball-bearing mig, or would fudge. It may sound
childish, but the same short sermon holds good in this
case.
Actually, the childishness of the situation lies "with those
individuals who failed to realize the seriousness of the
breach. Probably some of them still fail to realize what
they have done. It isn't that they can't understand, but
rather that they won't.
Kverv herd has its black sheep, and the Hoard of Ath
letic Control's representatives are due for a slap on the
back for their willingness to enforce a ruling which should
be respected.
