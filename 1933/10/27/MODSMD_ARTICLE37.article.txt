Already talk lias begun about the foreign professors
who will leach here next summer. II has long been the
eu.stom al Stanford to pay exceptionally high salaries to a
number of professors from abroad every summer quarter.
Ordinarily this is a good issue. The teachers from Eu
rope have a different viewpoint, and often they have in
formation and opinion to otter that cannot be obtained on
this side of the Atlantic.
In times of depression, however, it appears to be an
expensive luxury. With summer registration so low, Stan
lord professors who wish to leach during the summer may
be deprived of the opportunity, to find room for the for
eign teachers. It appears rather ridiculous to bring a schol
ar six thousand miles to leach half a dozen students, a good
percentage of whom may be high school teachers and pro
bation students. A good many of the foreign professors
can't give much to American students. There is always
the language difficulty, and in addition students and pro
lessor don't understand each other's methods.
The foreign professor generally lakes it for granted that
all the students understand French, German, and Latin,
while the students are puzzled not to hear jokes and anec
dotes peppered through the meatv part of the lecture.
