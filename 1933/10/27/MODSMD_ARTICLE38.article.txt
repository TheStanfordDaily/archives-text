# Dancing Girls
## 
### 
The Conference Parfv was probably a great success; it
always is. It affords a great opportunity for the i»i?• 1 s to
know each other, for the sorority lassies to get a "line" on
prospective rushces. Xo house has luncheons to waste.
Hut the annoying thing in this affair, the same thing
that annoyed the Daily last year, is the prospect of the
lassies dancing with each other. There is only one harm
in the practice it spoils the girl's dancing, makes a leader
«'til of her, a poor follower. That is to be most vehemently
condemned.
What is to be pitied is that dancing is the only means
the girls have of getting acquainted. It would seem that
they might stand around and chat. They could not meet so
many girls but they might meet them more thoroughly.
Mill why the premium on numbers? Hushing is the only
advantage ty learning the names of :i dozen girls. For com
fort on the campus, knowing three or four more intimately
vould be infinitely more valuable.
Several minutes' dancing is a poor insight into a pros
pective 1 friend. Ten minutes' conversation would be heller.
Or can it be that female collegians could not conduct an
interesting conversation with an unknown woman? Hot
ter, to perish that thought. It would be 100 perfectly hor
rible to contemplate.
