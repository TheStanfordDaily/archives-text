"CAPTURED" AND
"GOODBYE AGAIN"
At the Stanford Theatre
Surprisingly enough, "Goodbye
Again" is the outstanding half of
this double bill. It is a light and
fast-moving comedy of the Mad Hat
ter school, combining rapid and
senseless dialogue with clever
clowning from the leading players.
Chief clown Warren William por
trays Kenneth Bixby, an eratic, in
discreetly amorous author, whose
amours with his now-married first
love provide no little mirth for the
audience and no little alarm for
Joan Blondell, who really loves him.
The humor is on the whole not
pverly soiled, and fairly success
fully avoids the obvious. The most
amusing sequence is the one in
which William uses on Wallace Ford
the old trick of saying all his words
back at him.
Probably the outstanding piece of
work is that of Hugh Herbert as
the stupid husband of Bixby's first
love. His is a delightfully foolish
and lovable characterization.
Warren William overdoes his role
in a manner appropriate to his ri
diculously overdone lines and situ
ations. He fails to make a person of
Kenneth Bixby, but that was largely
the fault of the playwright. Joan
Blondell, with little to do but look
alternately pitying and devoted, is
capable.
"Captured" is a distinct disap
pointment, since in it Leslie Howard
is totally wasted, serving to render
tolerable an otherwise stupid pic
ture. He enacts the role of a British
army captain held prisoner by the
Germans; one is given to under
stand that he is very devoted to his
wife and to a friend named Digby,
which latter soon appears at the
prison. It is not difficult to guess
that Digby has meanwhile won the
love of Howard's wife.
Slow in getting under way, the
film sketches hastily over the lives
of the leading characters, of whom
only Howard and Paul Lukas man
age to appear as real people. Mar
garet Lindsay appears briefly, once
in the arms of Howard, and once in
these of Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.
Faii'banks gives a curiously erotic
performance, yelling and shouting
most of the time, rarely getting close
to his character.
Probably the most ludicrous scene
in any war film is the one in which
Fairbanks is returned by the Allies
tc the Germans, from whom he has
escaped. We see the white flag
raised by each side, firing ceases,
Fairbanks walks from the Allies'
trenches to the other side, a Briton
gives a cigarette to a German sol
dier, and the war resumes.
