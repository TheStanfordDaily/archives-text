II looked like rain to "Sunny
Jim" Rolph today when he received
a petition of 17,000 signatures to call
a special legislative session for sales
tax repeal. The Governor decided
to wait and talk things over with
the Chairman of the Federal Dis
pensary Tax Reduction League.
Legislators think the tax on 3.2
beer will not be effective if the al
coholic content is raised after re
peal. To forestall this they want to
change the law. They figure out that
if liquor is taxed enough, food can
be exempted from sales tax.
