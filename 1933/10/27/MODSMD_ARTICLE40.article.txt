Rail Bonds Insecure
All of which proves that even
most careful management will make
mistakes. A liquidation program for
dubious rail bonds had been started,
and had to stop with the late crash.
Today there are more uncertainties

has promised no inflation until
April, but .were the bond policy
changed, present holdings could not
be so quickly unloaded without
courting disaster, ruinous, give

In the meantime, Comptroller and
Trustees sit tight, hope inflation will
not be too severe, hope Stanford's
thus drastically reduced income can
be upped by industrial recovery
plus more registrations. Both are
needed to return income to normal.
