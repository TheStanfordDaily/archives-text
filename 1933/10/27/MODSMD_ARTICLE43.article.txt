THE TOOLS OF EDUCATION

Any one who has ever dozed ';
through a citizenship class has been
shocked in his waking moments by
that pet sociological utterance: Man
is fast becoming the slave of the
machine.
Unfortunately, this is one of the 1
few facts that Cit. students are able
to consider objectively. The "ma
chine slave" concept is far enough
removed from Stanford sophistica
tion to encourage calm, scientific ob
soiption. The "scientific method"
comes into its own; the instructor
is satisfied; "students are getting
something out of cit."
Objectivity has it place. But when
it works to effectively stifle any ;
subjective application of frigid, wor
shipped, scientific dogma, it becomes j
a dead weight, and should be
promptly heaved overboard.
Contemplating with scientific syn»- i
pathy the "poor tools" of the Ford
factory or the mechanical morons ;
of Erewhon, the student forgets that
he, too, is rapidly becoming a slave.
The University Schedule has become i
a modern dictator; Stanford slaves j
bow in humble obedience to Univer- I
sity Schedule's thunderous com- j
mands.
Up with the 7:30 alarm, breakfast
with the 7:45 power house whistle, j
in class with the 8:10 bell, out of;
class with another bell, on through j
the day's dizzy program—to the tune
of the crying bells. The rough main
tains all the independence of Mr.. |
Ford's most adept bolt twisters.
So attached to the whistles, j
squeaks, alarms, and mechanical
howls have we become, that we arc j
completely dominated. All else is I
secondary; )the bell is important.
The unfortunate professor, who, j
God forbid, overruns his allotted 40 :
minutes of talk-time, finds himself j
as neglected and forlorn as "Of Thee !
I Sing's" Mr. Throttlebottom. A last
philosophical bit of comment may be
nice, instructive, and all that, but
the bell whispers "Will you go,"
and Stanford, like Old Black Joe, 1
replies, "I'm coming." A professor
who attempts to argue with the bells

manifests supreme, hopeless optim- j
ism. When the bell calls, the robot I
answers. The professor is just an
other dodo.
The alarm is everything. What
matters it that someone jokingly
remarked that Stanford men were
gentlemen. Whether or not the
naive lecture is in the middle of
enunciating "Nebuchadnezzar," or
ollering a last friendly suggestion—
notebooks click, lecture interest (if
there ever were any) completely
fades, sleeping students are sud
denly filled with life; the grand
march is on.
If this were merely a curious phe
nomenon like an intelligent grid
iron hero or an interesting profes
sor, it would not be worth even
passing consideration. But the course
has become the rule. The mass rolls
on in fantastic rhythm to the bells.
The student marches. The pro
fessor sighs. The bells laugh. They
arc the masters!
