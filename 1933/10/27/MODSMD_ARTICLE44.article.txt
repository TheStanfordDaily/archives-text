ROUND TWO
Lackadaisical and Shallow Letter to
Oilman Oist.
Honored Sir:
If I knew what you were driving
at in your diatribe of yesterday, it
would be easier to reply. I gather
that you dislike my review, liked
"Morning Glory," and did not con
sider your "two bits" wasted, so I
don't see what the- shouting is all
about.
My impression of criticism is that
i f does not "suggest that one see"
a film, or "influence the reader's
desire to experience the subject"
(whatever that may mean). I have
the impression that critics arc to be
lead, not agreed with, and that most
people would like to know what it
is all about and form their own
opinions. I also have the impression
that nothing I or anyone could say
would influence anyone about a
Hepburn picture anyways.
II mention of remarkable direc
tion, skilled acting, a hint as to the
tone of the story, discussion of mi
nor characters and subtle use of
detail—if this doesn't give you an
idea of how you want to dispose of
your "two bits," I suggest that you
stay home and spend it telephoning
a San Francisco paper for their
opinion.
Of course, I could have said—
which I actually believe—that Hep
burn's was the best performance of
the year. Your reaction would have
probably been "lackadaisical and
shallow!" or "blah!" or both. Super
latives don't give much evidence of
"ihe psychological and philosophical
importance of the subject."
Moreover, if you should run across
any reviewer who can give those
two trivial qualities to a campus re
view, you're a better man than
Gunga Din, and he is welcome to
write for the Daily any time.
Equally sincerely,
Elizabeth Chapin
