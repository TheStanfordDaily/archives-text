# CONCERT POSTPONES FIRST FORUM MEET
## 
### 
Changed on account of the A.S. ,
S.U. concert Wednesday night, the j
first discussion session of the newly j
formed Public Forum will be held I
in the Little Theatre at 8:15 o clock i
Monday night.
As yet the speakers have not been
chosen, nor has the temporary j
chairman, who will be notified as
soon as they ai'e selected by the j
organizing committee. The order of j
the evening will be announced in
Monday's Daily, according to Presi- ;
dent von Breton.
Bearing on the question selected
at a meeting of the organizing com
mittee Tuesday night, "Resolved,
that this house favors prohibition !
of intoxicating liquors on the Stan- |
ford campus," the discussion will j
rage not only on the boards of the
Little Theatre stage but from the
floor, as free haggling from the au
dience will be allowed, controlled
by the chairman.
Rules of the famed Oxford Union
will be followed to some extent, in
cluding a standing vote at the end
of the session. At this opening
meeting only students and faculty
members are invited, because of the
fact that the airing-place is prima
rily for students and secondarily for
Palo Alto residents.
Those who went through the lo
cal - interest presidential campaign
this time last year will remember
the nedr-riot precipitated at one of
the Open Forums in the Little The
atre by a woman communist who
heeded few inhibitions in voicing
her opinions from the floor.
