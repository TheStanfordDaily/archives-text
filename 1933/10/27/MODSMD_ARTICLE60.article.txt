# COPY OF 'JOSH,' COMBINED GAY '90 HUMOR OF STANFORD, CALIFORNIA RESURRECTED
## 
### 
Stanford and California don't
usually laugh at the same thing,
but back in 1896 they shared a hu
mor magazine together that was
calculated to set collegiates of both
universities into gales of Gay-Nine
tyish laughter.
Christened "Josh," the magazine
was "devoted to the humorous in
terests of Stanford and California,"
according to its foreword. Making its
debut long before the days of Cha- j
pairal and Pelican, "Josh's" fort
nightly appearances were successful
on both sides of the bay.
One of the few copies in existence !

in the Library, shows that the wit
ticisms were arrange in sections, one
for the Cardinal and one for the
Blue and Gold. The position of these
sections was changed every five is
sues by tactful editors to prove that
there was no partiality in placing
| one or the other first.
Humor in those days apparently
ran to puns about one's rival col
lege, while art favored pen and ink |
sketches of smooth haired grid he
roes in turtle-neck sweaters.
One of "Josh's" editors was
Charles K. Field, '95, who has won
' fame as a New York radio adver
! tiser.
