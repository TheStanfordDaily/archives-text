# NEW WOMEN GO INTELLECTUAL, ARTISTIC; BRIEF CASES, DRAWING BOARDS POPULAR
## 
### 
Intellectual and artistic tendencies
among the new women account for
the unprecedented feminine regis
tration in diverse departments on
the campus.
In the first category, seven women,
compared to one for last year, are
now packing brief cases and boning
on legal technicalities in the tradi
tionally masculine Lav/ School. Ol
these, one is a transfer from Ari
zona in her third year.
"More women than we've evei
had before," boasted the law secre
tary, Marian McKendry.
Asked if all of the women whe
started law were admitted to tht
bar, she said that the majority

' probably would be. Admitted to the
Law Steps? No, those are taboo
even to Stanford's women Portias.
Across the campus, the artistic of
the new women have evidenced
their talent by signing up for art
courses to the tune of 50 for this
quarter compared to only 20 in the
i ; utumn of 1932.
Encouraged by this increase, sa
turnine-faced Edward Farmer, sole
surviving art professor, said: "Due
to the increased registration, it will
be only a matter of financial en
couragement before there is a school
of art at Stanford that will compare
with the finest of the other schools
in the University."
