### 
Stanford's Honor Code and its ul
timate success lies directly in the
hands of the present undergrad
uates, says Men's Council Chairman
Ernie Arbuckle.
"The value and desirability of
such a code rests entirely upon its
successful application," he declared.
'"II is successful only if the great
majority of students is willing to ad
here to it and is sufficiently inter
ested to bring to task the very small
minority which may violate it."
In reference to that small mino
rity, Arbuckle added that the Men's
Council has full power to expel any
violators of the code from Stan
ford, but that an ideal condition
would include enough student opin
ion to enforce the code without
heavy penalties being inflicted.
New students were asked to "do
i their part in contributing to the
code's success when they sign the
pledge. "No unpermitted aid given
or received" on each examination.
