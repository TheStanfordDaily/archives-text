# Tag Commander Bryant? Daily Wrong, Officer Says
## 
### 
Yesterday the Daily erred, stating
that Comminder Bryant was tagged
for failing to make a boulevard stop
at the golf course; the point of the
story being that the Commander
had sponsored that particular "ar
terial stop sign."
The Daily's phone jangled, Com
mander Bryant gave the truth:
never has he been arrested, said
he, "I have never contributed to the
'Springer Foundation'." (Judge
Springer is Palo Alto's police judge.)
Further, the Commander hasn't been
on the golf course since June.
It is true that he favored the stop
sign.
