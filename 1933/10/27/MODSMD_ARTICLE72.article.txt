Whenever a sports writer gets
an unusual idea on some subject
it's always gratifying for him to
have someone farther up in the
business confirm his beliefs. So
when we saw what Eddie J. Neil
of the Associated Press had to say
about pro football in his sports
column, "From the Sidelines," we
just had to pass it on.
"One grand old argument that
never dies is the college football
game versus the professional pas
time. If the best college team of
the year, say for instance the South
ern California eleven of last fall,
were to tackle the best pro outfit,
the Chicago Bears, what would hap
pen?
Would College Win?
"It's rny opinion the college team
would win. But there has grown
up all around the professional cir
cuit a host of rabid rooters that
would battle against such a conten
tion to the death. The arguments
are weighty. Ability is lavished on
both sides. The one point that might
determine the issue is spirit.
"No college team,* playing as a
unit, fighting for an ideal, has ever
come in contact with a professional
team, playing just another ball game.
Knute Roekne, in one of his final
gestures in behalf of the game he
loved, gathered his former greats
around him and sent them into ac
tion against the New York Giants in
behalf of charity.
"Out of condition, uninterested
< xcept in having fun, with no issue
rt stake, the Noire Dame veterans
took a shellacking. But that proved
nothing.
"You could venture to say, with
out getting a denial from the owner
of any pro team, that last year's
Southern California outfit, and this
year's too, contained all the ability
any team, amateur or professional
could ask. Giant linesmen, fast, cou
rageous, intelligent, ploughing ahead
of swift, belting backs.
Pro Teamwork
No pro team has more than that.
The pros do have added experience,
maturity, perhaps a higher standard
of man for man brilliance. Their
team work is precise, their lines al
most invulnerable. Their passers,
kickers, are men grown sure and
great through additional years of
practice. They make no mistakes.
They're the Southern Californians of
a couple of seasons back, say.
"But vitally must they miss the
spark, the enthusiasm, the lift of
the crowd cheering them on, the
do-or-die for dear old Whosis of the
college player. And when ability is
matched evenly, with the only dif
ference a slight edge in experience,
then that spirit, that fight and fire,
should prove just about the differ
ence in the two games.
Collegians vs. Pros
"The question could be settled
once and for all by a charity game,
bringing this year's college cham
pion, or any real fine college team
that happened to be available,
against the professional champions
for the sake of charity, which today
needs every-bit of aid that can be
.summoned. That's one football game
I'd pay to see.
"Down in Pittsburgh, where
crowds of 20,000 are ordinary for
professional games, there developed
one yarn this season to challenge
anything happening on college grid
irons.
"On the Pirates' bench sits a vet
eran of sandlot football, a great
kicker in his time, now a bartender
and a famous character about town,
known as "Butch." His attachment
to the team is chiefly sentimental.
He could not hope to compete
against the husky college graduates
row making up the pro team ranks,
"Butch" Boots 'Em
"There came a moment, though, in
the opening game of the Pirate sea
son, when someone had to kick a
goal after touchdown in order to
hold the enemy even. "Butch" wan
tiered in and booted it. In the sec
ond. half the Pirates scored again,
tying the score, and the winning
point was waiting to be kicked. In
went "Butch," the bartender, and
he kicked that one too.
"So if the pros, occasionally, have
to go back to the old sandlot stars
for the margin of victory, I'll still in
sist they're not invulnerable.
"Butch," make mine Southern
California."

That's what K. J. X. thinks, and
it expresses our mind perfectly.
The only pro grid game we've seen
was Ernie Never's All-Stars vs.
the Green Bay Packers last Janu
ary. and despite all the ballyhoo
spread by the pro's themselves
and with due respect to our Er
nie, S.C. could have run rings
through both of them in the same
afternoon. â€”Hamilton
