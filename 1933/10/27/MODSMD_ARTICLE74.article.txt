# Card Babes Point For Bronc Frosh Tomorrow
## PATCHED TEAM TO FACE DETERMINED SANTA CLARA BID 
### Charles Chappell 
Determined to resume their early |
season winning streak, Coach Jim- j
mie Bradshaw's frosh gridders will !
tackle the powerful Santa Clara
first-year team tomorrow afternoon, j
The game will start at 2 o'clock in
the Stanford Stadium.
With Captain Dale Beedlc on
crutches and definitely out of (he j
game and first-string halfback Joe
Vigna also disabled, a patched-up
starling line-up will take the field
tomorrow as the Babes go into
one of the hardest games of their
season.
The tentative line-up finds Mel- 1
vin Hurley moving into Beedle's {
tackle spot, with Ray Williamson
holding down the same position at
the other end of the line. The end
posts will be taken care of by the
old reliable combination of Walt
Chouteau at the right flank and Carl ;
Schott on the left. On defense these !
two wingmen trade positions. In re- j
serve will be three more good ends |
in the persons of Jim Reynolds,
Harold Elder, and Bob Jenkins.
Shift Tsoutsouvas
Louis Tsoutsouvas, chunky tackle
and former high school center, has
been shifted to a guard post where
he will pair off with Paul Spinnetti ,
in the starting line-up. Jack Geisen, 1
out for most of the past week, will
be on deck also if needed. Ralph i
Quails again gets the call at center
over George Bergman, although
both will probably see plenty of
action.
In the backfield Jack Rolls will
take Vigna's place at halfback with
Grigo Turretto, the squad's star j
punter, at the other half. Backing
up the line at fullback will be Chuck
Ledbetter, bandadged hand and all. '
Fred Williams, Olathe, Colorado's i
triple-threat contribution to Stan
ford football, will hold down the
quarterback post. Given out last j
night as the probable line-up, the
foregoing list may be changed a bit
by Bradshaw before game time.
Broncs Fast
All reports about the Santa Clara
yearlings agree that they are a big. !
fast, and alert team, a seldom-found !
and much - desired combination.
Heads up football that has made it
possible for them to capitalize on the 1
breaks of the game is a characteris
tic of the Broncs and has led to a j
good many of their touchdowns.
Playing Stanford for the first time j
in several years, the Santa Clara
frosh are primed to upset the Cardi
nal applecart, a task of which they
are well capable. If his team plays
as it can play and has played, how- ;
ever, Coach Bradshaw believes the
Indian frosh can send the Santa
Clara Bronc home a chastened and
well-broken critter.
Weak on Passes
Pass defense, chief weakness of
the Babes against Menlo last Sat
urday has received considerable at- j
tention in practice this week. A
scrimmage against the Grays last \
night was directed toward remedy- !
ing this vulnerable point in the
Stanford defense.
With one team under Coach John
Bunn mastering the distinctive "1-
2-3, oop," arm-swinging Santa Clara
shift and other Bronco formations
for use in scrimmage against the i
regulars, the Stanford frosh are
well-grounded in what to expect
when they take the field against the
visitors tomorrow.
