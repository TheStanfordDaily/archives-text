# JONES KNOCKS FRIEND WARNER
## 
### 
Coach Howard Jones of the Uni
versity of Southern California bold
ly stepped forth to take a crack at
his old friend and rival, "Pop"' War
ner, yesterday. The Associated Press
reported that Jones echoed the sen
timents of Lou Little of Columbia
in advocating that players be al
lowed to run with a loose ball.
Now it looks as if Jones has a
legitimate scream to counteract
Warner's heckling of the shifters,
which has occupied the rules com
mittee these long years. Warner
got the rules changed to handicap
a shifting team and now Jones
would like to seem them changed to
handicap a reversing team. It looks
like a swell era for the defensive
teams like Michigan, if the two
leading coaches have their way.
