# INDIAN GOLF STAR FACES CLASH WITH CHARLES FERERRA
## 
### 
A clash with the twice national
public links champion, Charles Fer
erra of San Francisco, is what faces
Don Edwards, recently installed
Stanford number two golf man,
when the San Jose City tournament
resumes play this week-end at that
city's Hillvicw course.
The match will be eighteen holes;
the winner meeting the victor of a
contest between ex-Stanford man
Jimmie Rhea and Walt Williams,
San Jose high school football coach,
in the 36-hole final match.
Edwards came into the finals by
defeating his two schoolmates Dan
Moser and Morse Erskine in extra
hole matches. Moser carried the
victor to the twentieth hole before
a birdie three subdued his bid.
Morse Erskine carried Edwards to
the nineteenth hole before being
overcome.
Wise fence birds give Edwards a
better than even chance with the
experienced Alumnus
Rhea is favored over his coach op
ponent by a long margin. In the
final match if that combination
meets, it is hard to guess just what
will happen. Edwards and his op
ponent both know the Hillview
course to perfection and both have
about the same amount of com
petitive expereince. It will just de
pend upon which is the better play
er for that day. Edwards seems to
have the edge of superior strength,
but that means very little in a golf
match. Rhea is the older.
