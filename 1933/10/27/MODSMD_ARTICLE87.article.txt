# COAST GRIDDERS TANGLE; TROJANS, BEARS STARRED
## 
### Frank Tremaine 
With every conference team en
giiyed in a battle which will have an
effect on the standings, positions of
Coast Conference squads will prob
ably be considerably altered by to
morrow night.
The Pacific Const spotlight will
lie focused on Berkeley where the
Trojans will attempt to prove that
last week's tie with Oregon Stale
was merely an off-day and not the
beginning of the end while the
potentially great California squad
is primed to end the Southern
California reign once and for all.
Other games find Stanford playing
Washington at Seattle, Oregon and
U.C.L.A. at Lo.s Angeles, Washing
ton State and Oregon State at Port
land, and Montana and Idaho clash
ing at Moscow. Non-conference St.
Mary's starts her three weeks' trek
Willi her first game at Nevada.
U.S.C. Weakened
The Berkeley game finds U.S.C.
in a tough spot with 13 players on
the hospital list. It is doubtful
whether Rosenberg, the great run
ning guard; Bescos, regular end;
and Wotkyns, fullback, will be able
t( play. In addition regular tackle
Er.skine i.s definitely out and his
place will probably be taken by
Bright who started the season at
fullback.
California is ready to shoot the
works against the Trojans tomor
row. "Navy Bill" Ingram will prob
ably start his heavy backfield in an
efiort to soften the Southern Cali
fornians for his speedsters, notably
Arleigh Williams. The biggest blow
to Bear hopes is the announcement
that Floyd Blower, outstanding
passer and runner, is definitely out.
Cards Strong
Washington, with a strong first
team and few reserves, should find
it tough sledding if Thornhill keeps
to his promise that the Cards will
tui n on the power tomorrow. The
flash shown at Kezar last Saturday
in the last quarter was an offense
that would tax a squad with plenty
of reserve strength.
The opportunity to dump the
leaders faces U.C.L.A. tomorrow as
Oregon tops the conference with
two victories. The Biuins' biggest
problem i.s stopping crashing Mike
Mikaluk and spring Chuck Chesire
and Joe Sarver into the open.
The teams that scored last week's
two big upsets, Washington State,
which tied California, and Oregon
State, the squad which slopped
Troy's long winning streak with a
scoreless tie, clash at Portland. It
will be the strong right arm of the
Cougars' Phil Sarboc against ihe
nimble feet of the Beavers' "Red''
Franklin.
Idaho and Montana will stage
their annual battle for Ihe Coast
cellar championship with "Wee Wil
lis" Smith, Vandal speedster, mak
ing Idaho the favorite to finish
ahead of Montana.

fornians for his speedsters, notably
Arleigh Williams. The biggest blow
to Bear hopes is the announcement
that Floyd Blower, outstanding
passer and runner, is definitely out.
Cards Strong
Washington, with a strong first
team and few reserves, should find
it tough sledding if Thornhill keeps
to his promise that the Cards will
tui n on the power tomorrow. The
flash shown at Kezar last Saturday
in the last quarter was an offense
that would tax a squad with plenty
of reserve strength.
The opportunity to dump the
leaders faces U.C.L.A. tomorrow as
Oregon tops the conference with
two victories. The Biuins' biggest
problem i.s stopping crashing Mike
Mikaluk and spring Chuck Chesire
and Joe Sarver into the open.
The teams that scored last week's
two big upsets, Washington State,
which tied California, and Oregon
State, the squad which slopped
Troy's long winning streak with a
scoreless tie, clash at Portland. It
will be the strong right arm of the
Cougars' Phil Sarboc against ihe
nimble feet of the Beavers' "Red''
Franklin.
Idaho and Montana will stage
their annual battle for Ihe Coast
cellar championship with "Wee Wil
lis" Smith, Vandal speedster, mak
ing Idaho the favorite to finish
ahead of Montana.
With every conference team en
giiyed in a battle which will have an
effect on the standings, positions of
Coast Conference squads will prob
ably be considerably altered by to
morrow night.
The Pacific Const spotlight will
lie focused on Berkeley where the
Trojans will attempt to prove that
last week's tie with Oregon Stale
was merely an off-day and not the
beginning of the end while the
potentially great California squad
is primed to end the Southern
California reign once and for all.
Other games find Stanford playing
Washington at Seattle, Oregon and
U.C.L.A. at Lo.s Angeles, Washing
ton State and Oregon State at Port
land, and Montana and Idaho clash
ing at Moscow. Non-conference St.
Mary's starts her three weeks' trek
Willi her first game at Nevada.
U.S.C. Weakened
The Berkeley game finds U.S.C.
in a tough spot with 13 players on
the hospital list. It is doubtful
whether Rosenberg, the great run
ning guard; Bescos, regular end;
and Wotkyns, fullback, will be able
t( play. In addition regular tackle
Er.skine i.s definitely out and his
place will probably be taken by
Bright who started the season at
fullback.
California is ready to shoot the
works against the Trojans tomor
row. "Navy Bill" Ingram will prob
ably start his heavy backfield in an
efiort to soften the Southern Cali
fornians for his speedsters, notably
Arleigh Williams. The biggest blow
to Bear hopes is the announcement
that Floyd Blower, outstanding
passer and runner, is definitely out.
