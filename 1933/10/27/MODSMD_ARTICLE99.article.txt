Talking before an interested group
of chemists, faculty, research asso- j

lists, Dr. Ralph C. Shuey yesterday ;
j presented his version of the fami- j
liar topic, "College Education and a |
i Career."
He mentioned the opportunities
offered in the large industrial con- j
itemed of the country today, and

| firm he is now director of research j
j and development.

i ihe painstaking care which all em- j
i bryo chemists find they must de- |
' velop in laboratories. The next step
j on the road to a successful career is
I perserverance, he said; and then j
proper co-ordination of all of one's j
efforts. But before a student is
I properly fitted for a scientific ca- j
I reer, Shuey pointed out that he must j

j his work and of its background.

\ trial Chemistry at the University of j
