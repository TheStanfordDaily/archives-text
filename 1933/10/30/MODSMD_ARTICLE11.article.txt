# PICK DEBATERS FOR BERKELEY, CANADIAN TRIPS
## Grantier, Woodbury to Go To British Columbia; Kay, King to U.C. RADIO FIELD NARROWS Fourteen Men to Compete For Cambridge Meet 
### 
Turmoil in varsity debating cir
cles gave way to order today as a
two-man team for the British Co
lumbia meet emerged from a group
of five candidates, a definite squad
for Thursday's Stanford-California
clash was named, and a mass of men
were eliminated from the competi
tion for the Cambridge radio debate.
Across the Canadian border
will go Robert Grantier, Rollin
Woodbury.
Berkcleyward will go Jack King,
Ronald Kay. Staying at Stanford
to meet the women invaders will
be Robert Grantier, John Lyman.
To the English corner's impro
vised broadcasting studio, a large
group will stride this afternoon at
4 o'clock and compete for Stanford-
Cambridge team positions. Included
in the undergraduate group are:
James Minor, David Mellinkoff, Joe
Fessio, Will Rogers Jr., Fred Bold,
Dick Van Wagenen, Dick Strouse,
Arthur Lundin, Ronald Kay. Grad
uate students who will compete are:
John Gange, Isadore Botasof, George
end Wadieh Shibley, and Daniel
Bryant
May Debate U.W.
Winners of the week's biggest
prize, Grantier and Woodbury, will
start on their extended Vancouver
junket November 12. If negotiations
now being conducted work out, they
will stop en route homeward at the
University of Washington for a de
bate.
An ingenious device consisting of
a microphone in one room and a
loudspeaker in another room was
installed Friday by electrical engi
neering graduate James Sharp, to
aid judges in selection of a radio
debate team.
Radio tests were startling. Men
who might have been chosen if the
loudspeaker had not been used,
were found to have "impossible" ra
dio voices. Conversely, one man
was found to have an excellent ra
dio manner, whereas on the plat
form he is only a good speaker.
Radio Tryouts
This afternoon between 4 and 6
o'clock a council of four judges will
listen to all Carrtbridge tryoutees
"broadcast," speakers unseen. An
nouncement of speakers and selec
tion of a team will be made, not by
I name, but by number.
When Stanford's male affirmative
team meets California's negative
women's team in the Little Theatre
Thursday evening, Public Forum
members will have opportunity to
practice speaking from the floor.
After the team members have pre
sented their cases, discussion from
the floor will be in order. By way
of conclusion, a Stanford man will
summarize the affirmative floor dis
cussion, a woman will summarize
the negative. Purpose of the sum
mary is to tie all discussion to
gether, also for the speakers to show
how their cases have been further
strengthened from the floor.

Radio Tryouts
This afternoon between 4 and 6
o'clock a council of four judges will
listen to all Carrtbridge tryoutees
"broadcast," speakers unseen. An
nouncement of speakers and selec
tion of a team will be made, not by
I name, but by number.
When Stanford's male affirmative
team meets California's negative
women's team in the Little Theatre
Thursday evening, Public Forum
members will have opportunity to
practice speaking from the floor.
After the team members have pre
sented their cases, discussion from
the floor will be in order. By way
of conclusion, a Stanford man will
summarize the affirmative floor dis
cussion, a woman will summarize
the negative. Purpose of the sum
mary is to tie all discussion to
gether, also for the speakers to show
how their cases have been further
strengthened from the floor.
Turmoil in varsity debating cir
cles gave way to order today as a
two-man team for the British Co
lumbia meet emerged from a group
of five candidates, a definite squad
for Thursday's Stanford-California
clash was named, and a mass of men
were eliminated from the competi
tion for the Cambridge radio debate.
Across the Canadian border
will go Robert Grantier, Rollin
Woodbury.
Berkcleyward will go Jack King,
Ronald Kay. Staying at Stanford
to meet the women invaders will
be Robert Grantier, John Lyman.
To the English corner's impro
vised broadcasting studio, a large
group will stride this afternoon at
4 o'clock and compete for Stanford-
Cambridge team positions. Included
in the undergraduate group are:
James Minor, David Mellinkoff, Joe
Fessio, Will Rogers Jr., Fred Bold,
Dick Van Wagenen, Dick Strouse,
Arthur Lundin, Ronald Kay. Grad
uate students who will compete are:
John Gange, Isadore Botasof, George
end Wadieh Shibley, and Daniel
Bryant
May Debate U.W.
Winners of the week's biggest
prize, Grantier and Woodbury, will
start on their extended Vancouver
junket November 12. If negotiations
now being conducted work out, they
will stop en route homeward at the
University of Washington for a de
bate.
An ingenious device consisting of
a microphone in one room and a
loudspeaker in another room was
installed Friday by electrical engi
neering graduate James Sharp, to
aid judges in selection of a radio
debate team.
Radio tests were startling. Men
who might have been chosen if the
loudspeaker had not been used,
were found to have "impossible" ra
dio voices. Conversely, one man
was found to have an excellent ra
dio manner, whereas on the plat
form he is only a good speaker.
