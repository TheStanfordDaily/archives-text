Unanimous agreement between
Stanford and California that no
protection is needed for the Axe,
now that it is an official trophy,
did not keep Jerry Trautman
from having the jitters when a
newspaper camera was mentioned
in connection with the famed

Remembering that it was Stan
ford roughs, in the guise of ca

man refused to allow a San Fran
cisco newspaper to photograph
the trophy as it awaits mounting
at a city engraver's.
Suspicious or superstious, all
the student prexy would say was
"awfully sorry" to the paper's
plea.
