# PAVILION JOLLY-UP TOMORROW NIGHT
## 
### 
In the shadow of frosh ridden En
cina, Stanford's new women will get
their chance to meet the men. For
tomorrow night in the Cardinal
small-sized Pavilion men and women
will dance at another all-University
jelly-up at 7 and 8 o'clock.
In charge of the event will be the
ex committee of the Union unit
headed by hard working Justine
Jankowsky, a student committee
with Bill Morse giving orders, En
cina sponsors bossed by ex-gridder
"Red" Gribben, and Roble sponsors
headed by Ruth Fisher.
To really give the "500 plus" a
chance to dance and chatter with the
men, chiefs of the much-sponsored
jolly-up have decreed that partners
switch every two or three numbers.
To start feet moving Gordon Heche's
eight-piece orchestra will coax out
modern rhythms.
Far-seeing student officials look
on tomorrow's jolly-up as â€¢; prece
dent-setting tradition-making dance
that will fill in empty spaces left by
the exodus of Stanford traditions.
