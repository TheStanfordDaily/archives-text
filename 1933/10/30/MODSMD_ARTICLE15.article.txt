"Some students have the idea that
the germ of infectous enteritis can
be picked up at eating places, and,
consequently have been worrying
about where they eat and also the
condition of all food they eat," Dr.

went on to say that the germ is of
an infectous nature being in the air,
but that it is not being found in
foods.
Thirty cases of infectous enteritis
have been reported at the Palo Alto
hospital, but the condition is not

down the Coast reports have come
of the prevalence of this intestinal
flu. The total number of cases here
has declined steadily.
