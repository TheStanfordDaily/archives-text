# HUSKY DEFEAT LESSENS HOPE FOR S. C. WIN
## Indians' Chances to Whip Trojans Fall off As U.W. Wins 6-0 
### Frank Tremaine 
Wit!) California letting down just
long enough for "Scooter" Warbur
ton to race 59 yards to a touchdown
and a 6 to 3 victory for U.S.C. and
Stanford being dumped by Washing
ton 6 to 0, it looks as though it
would be left up to Oregon, the
Conference leaders with three wins
and no defeats, or the Huskies to
keep Troy from landing in the top
spot in the Pacific Coast Conference
for the third successive season.
An uncommon young man with
a common name, Bill Smith, who
leads the University of Washing
ton gridders proved just a little
more than a rain-soaked Stanford
football team could handle Satur
day in Seattle, and the Cards left
the field on the short end of a (>
to 0 score, the result of the two
field goals by this uncommon
Smith.
The Bears staged a grand fight at
Berkeley, leading the Trojans 3 to 0
for three quarters only to see War
burton blast their hopes. A first
quarter pass which resulted in a
touchdown was enough for Oregon
to defeat U.C.L.A. 7 to 0 while a
safety allowed Oregon State to beat
Washington State 2 to 0.
Cards Easy
Eleven Washington Huskies had
little difficulty in keeping Stanford's
nig Red Machine well in hand.
A powerful Washington defense, a
wet ball and a wet field combined
to hold Stanford offense down to a
paltry 45 yards gained from scrim
mage.
The Indians showed a pretty
powerful defense themselves. Only
once did Washington really
threaten to cross the goal line hut
on two other occasions they got
inside the 15-yard line which was
close enough for Mr. Smith's edu
cated toe.
Soon after the game started, Mu
czynski, who kept Stanford in hot
water most of the game with his ac
curate spirals, kicked to the Card
5-yard line where the ball bounced
against Bill Sim and Joe Wiatrak
recovered for the Huskies.
Stanford Holds
With five yards to go for a touch
down, Muczynski hit the line for a
yard, Sulkosky picked up half a
yard, Muczynski ploughed through
for two and a half yards. With one
jard to go Sulkosky took the ball
and was held just six inches from
a score.
Maentz kicked out to the 42-yard
line but the Huskies had been too
close to a score to be denied. After
two plays gained but two yards,
Smith, from his end position, took
the ball on a reverse and rambled
to the Stanford 25. On successive
attempts Muczynski gained five
yards, then eight, taking the ball to
the 12-yard line.
Huskies Score
Smith made a yard but Washing
ton was penalized five yards on the
next play and after two attempts
had gained but three of them back.
Smith went into the backfield and
with Hornbeak holding it booted the
ball between the goal posts for three
points.
The third quarter started with
Washington kicking off to Stanford
and the Cards couldn't get out of
their own territory until Smith had
scored again. Sulkosky almost got
away for a touchdown when he ran
25 yards on a reverse and was
caught by Bill Bates on Stanford's
35-yard line.
After an exchange of punts, Horn
beak ran one of Reisner's kicks back
to the Card 32 and three plays later
Washington completed the only pass
of the game, Muczynski to De√üoin,
from the 27 to the 14-yard line.
Again the stubborn Indian de
fense held for three plays and
again Smith stepped into the back
field and added three more points
with another perfect kick.
Grayson Stopped
Grayson replaced Hillman, who
had carried a large share of the of
fensive burden for the Cards for
three quarters, but they all looked
alike to Washington Saturday. The
Husky line continued to hold for
another quarter. Jimmy Phclan
didn't substitute a single player
throughout the game.
