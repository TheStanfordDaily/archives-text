# Series Must Raise $1200 To Succeed
## 
### 
A fortune to some but "merely
encouraging" to Manager Prentice
Mcssimer, the $4,500 that have al
ready poured into Concert Series
cpffers may make possible a suc
cessful year financially, must be aug
mented by more student support if
this is to occur.
Far ahead of last year's record in
quantity of season books sold, the
Scries expects to approach its $7,200
budget figure during the next three
days when sales should be heavy.
The five artists aggregate a $6,000
item; office expenses are estimated
at $1,200 more; of this, at least $0,000
must be supplied by season book
buyers.
Three Arc Familiar
Of the famed quintet, three have
appeared at Stanford before. Mischa
Elman, round-faced violinist who
will open the Series Wednesday;
American baritone John Charles
Thomas, and soprano Rosa Ponselle
have on various occasions during
recent years been acclaimed by
Stanford audiences. Teresina, grace
ful Spanish dancer without a first
name, and Walter Gieseking will b<-
new to the campus this year.
With a $5 top price ($4 to Stan
ford students) and with a majority
of the better $2 scats already
sold for the entire Series, Mcssi
mer expects that most of this
group and all of the few remain
ing $2 seats will be purchased the
beginning of this week. Individual
scat sales will be held before each
concert; it is expected that about
$1,200 will be garnered from them.
Tickets Are Ready
Those who have already purchased
their season books may obtain them
now at the Concert Series office in
and must do so since
no books are being mailed. The re
maining tickets can also be pur
chased at the same place.
Norman Barnes, house manager
for the Series, announced last night
that, all men ushers must appear at
the Series office or see him some
time today. Instructions and passes
will be given out to all on the fol
lowing list who appear:
Thomas Macomber, Joseph Jones,

Wright, R. Van Etten, Win. Morse,

A fortune to some but "merely
encouraging" to Manager Prentice
Mcssimer, the $4,500 that have al
ready poured into Concert Series
cpffers may make possible a suc
cessful year financially, must be aug
mented by more student support if
this is to occur.
Far ahead of last year's record in
quantity of season books sold, the
Scries expects to approach its $7,200
budget figure during the next three
days when sales should be heavy.
The five artists aggregate a $6,000
item; office expenses are estimated
at $1,200 more; of this, at least $0,000
must be supplied by season book
buyers.
Three Arc Familiar
Of the famed quintet, three have
appeared at Stanford before. Mischa
Elman, round-faced violinist who
will open the Series Wednesday;
American baritone John Charles
Thomas, and soprano Rosa Ponselle
have on various occasions during
recent years been acclaimed by
Stanford audiences. Teresina, grace
ful Spanish dancer without a first
name, and Walter Gieseking will b<-
new to the campus this year.
With a $5 top price ($4 to Stan
ford students) and with a majority
of the better $2 scats already
sold for the entire Series, Mcssi
mer expects that most of this
group and all of the few remain
ing $2 seats will be purchased the
beginning of this week. Individual
scat sales will be held before each
concert; it is expected that about
$1,200 will be garnered from them.

their season books may obtain them
