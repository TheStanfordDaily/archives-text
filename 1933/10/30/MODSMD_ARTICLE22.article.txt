# Illustrated Review, Out Soon, to Feature Axe
## 
### 
Titled the Big Game Issue, the Il
lustrated Review for November is
on the press, to be ready for dis
tribution late this week. In keeping
with the theme for the month, the
cover design will be a cut of the
Axe, drawn by Nick Dunphy, '15, at
the time it was brought back from
Berkeley; and one of the features
will be the news to alumni of the
Axe as Big Game trophy this year.
The November Review is replete
with student contributors, with
Anna Louise Aynesworth's story of
new women and their activities,
Jimmy Sandoe's article on Sword
and Sandals, and Bill Corbus' mid
season review of the Thornhill grid
machine.
