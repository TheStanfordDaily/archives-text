# VILLIERS TALKS TUESDAY NIGHT
## 
### 
"By Way of Cape Horn," the tale
of one of the voyages of the last
square-rigger, the Grace Harwar,
will form the basis of Alan Villiers'
Tuesday evening lecture at 7:30
o'clock in the Assembly Hall. Vil- j
liers will also describe to some ex- i
tent the famous trip made last year 1
by the Parma.
Himself an able-bodied seaman 1
with haughty disregard for steam
locomotion, Villiers and his partner,
Ronald Walker, signed as seamen on
the Gracc Ilarwar, a full-rigged Fin
nish ship. Their purpose: to make
a motion picture record of the voy- ,
age of one of the few remaining j
sailing vessels.
Ship Reaches Cobh
Five months after the Grace liar- ,
war, camera-laden, began her mo- ,
mentous journey she staggered into j
Cobh, Ireland. Death, hunger, mad- ;
ness, and all manner of misfortune
had visited her. She arrived with a
full cargo of wheat and a far more
precious cargo of thousands of feet
of motion-picture film which will il
lustrate the lecture Villiers is to ,
give. The original negative is in the ,
British Museum of Science.
"By Way of Cape Horn" has been ;
described as "an authentic portrayal
of the glory of sail. . . . There is no \
question of the realism of these pic- !
tures; no suggestion of the direc
tor's hand."
Villiers in Grain Race
Villiers is known as the man who j
made the great grain race from Aus
tralia to England famous. He has j
written a book about his first expe
rience and since then has twice |
come in first with the Parma, in
which he recently acquired a half
interest.
He was born in Melbourne, Aus- |
tralia, and shipped at an early age
in a square-rigger sailing vessel;
since then he has spent most of his j
life before the mast.
