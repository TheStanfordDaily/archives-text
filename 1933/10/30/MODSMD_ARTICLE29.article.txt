# DON FULL-DRESS FOR REHEARSALS
## 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
As the November 3 production of j
"Arms and the Man" is whipped into |
! shape by Director Helvenston, some j
' more interesting thumb - nose |
j sketches have reared their pretty j
i heads at the rehearsals, which the j
| cast are now beginning to attend in j
full dress.

Costumed accordingly, Mary Anita
Loos, leading woman, spends the
major portion of Act I in a bed
which she says is "about as soft as
lying on a sack of walnuts."
Peckham appears as a tired and
sleepy fugitive in the first act, and
then finally is able to be romantic
in the last two acts. He appears as
the blunt Captain Bluntschii (which
is more truth than pun), but he
wins the heroine in the end.
Realism seems to be the keynote
of the fisticuffs between George
Leavens and Jean Albertson, as wit
ness the fact that La Albertson has
a bruise on one arm which promises
to be good-sized by Friday night.
The potent Petkoffs, played by
Virginia Marvin and Paul Crary,
are an interesting pair, with Miss
Marvin alternating between sur
prise and alarm, Crary between
snorting and shouting.
Waldo Salt has the role of Nicola,
the stupid servant, and the high
light of his part is a healthy fall
which he takes every night. He
threatens to bring a pillow any day
now.
