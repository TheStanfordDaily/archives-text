# Stolen Hens, 'Tight' Cook Give Cops Busy Weekend
## 
### 
Stolen chickens, drunken frater- '
r.ity cooks, and speeding students
armed with blank revolvers added
excitement to the Palo Alio police
department's week-end and zest to
campus-town relationships.
The theft of ten hens from a May
field address was attributed to Stan
ford students although the police
clerk admitted that the evidence
was "eaten up and not traceable."
He suspected a connection between
the missing chickens and the fact
that a cook of a prominent frater
nity was resting in the local jail j
after successfully drowning his sor
rows over Stanford's grid defeat.
The chef, one P. D. Clayton, was !
found lying in the traditional gutter I
late Saturday night by police whp |
say he has ten previous cases of
drunkenness on his record.
A Sequoia student, arrested Sun
day morning for speeding, had a lot |
ol explaining to do when a search of
his Car revealed one fancy, pearl -
handled revolver with blank earl

' ridges, one pair of handcuffs, and!
one official badge from the Los An
geles sheriff's office.
This incriminating evidence was
accounted for as part of experiments
conducted by his class in criminol- j
ogy at Stanford. Local police ac- j
1 cepted his story, but commented,
"Just a crazy kid with lots of wild
ideas about the life of a policeman." j
Other campus business included I
a maroon-colored Buick roadster, i
reported stolen from the front of J
the Alpha Tau Omega house by j
Charles Parker who said it disap- i
j peared some time between Satur- 1
day noon and yesterday afternoon.
The license number is 3&953.
The mystery of the bannered
! U.S.C. car, wrecked, and abandoned
I in front of the campus on the high
way yesterday morning could not
| be solved by local police. They said
(hey had no report of the auto,
I which, with one wheel off and lug
gage strewn over the road, presented
a woe-begone picture in the cold'
i !'ivy dawn,
