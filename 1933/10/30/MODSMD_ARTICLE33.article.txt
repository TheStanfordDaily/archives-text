# CONSTITUTION REVISION DROOP TO BE CHOSEN
## Trautman to Pick Members Subject to Approval Of Ex-Committee CHANGE IS NECESSARY Plan To Be Submitted To Popular Balloting 
### 
With the future trend of student
I government at Stanford lying pre
j eariously between the horns of an
i unprecendented dilemna, A.S.S.IJ.
! President Jerry Trautman an
i nounced that some time tomorrow
| he will appoint the committee to re-
I vise the present Constitution.
| Present indications point to five
members being picked to serve on
what is certain to prove the most
important committee in recent con
jsiitutional history at Stanford. Ap
pointed by Trautman, the commit
j teemen will be approved or disap
j proved by the Executive Committee
iat its regular Tuesday evening
i meeting.
Two Alternatives
Presenting the alternative of con
tinuing under the present system of
ambiguous phraseology, multitudi
nous amendments, and overlapping
i powers or a smaller but much more
! potent Constitution that will con
| tain more meat and fewer trim-
I mings, the committee, after ap
j pointment, will work out a plan that
I may or may not, be adopted by
J students through the medium of
I popular vote. The spirit of the Con
stitution, satisfactory, will remain
! unmolested; the form of the Consti
tution, at present muddled, may be
altered.
The exigencies of the present
i situation at Stanford make altera
tion of some sort in the A.S.S.U.
Constitution imperative. Addi
tional women, fading traditions,
previous misconceptionsâ€”all cry
j for a change.
' Many Possibilities
The Stanford man - and - woman
I relationship in student government.
I may be profoundly altered. It is
; possible that A.W.S. and A.S.S.U.
| will be merged into one body; that
i there will be separate Associated
Women's Student and Associated
Men's Student organizations with the
I A.S.S.U. continuing, but dealing
j only with problems of mutual inter-
Jest and concern to both men and
j women; that the present plan will
j be continued.
concerning in
particular the future of the present
j A.S.S.U. boards with relegated pow-
J ers. Important among these are the
! Publications Council and the Dra
j rr.atic Council. To further confuse
i the situation, it will be remembered
ithat last year's Executive Commit
tee over-rode both boards on mo
! mcntous occasions: the Publications
Council in the case of the Daily edi
! ton-hip, the Dramatic Council in the
j selection of plays.
Many to Be Influenced
Almost all phases of Stanford life
1 will be influenced if the alterations
jgo through. To mention but a few:
'all publications, from Daily through
Quad to Chaparral; the Concert Se
jries; debating and dramatics; athletic
|letic awaj ds; and even traditional
campus activities.
The move, fundamental and far
reaching, is completely legal. The
Constitution, in Section (i of Ar
ticle X, states that, "At the begin
! ning of the winter quarter of I!KM
I and every four years thereafter,
j the president of this association
i shall appoint a Constitutional Ite
j vision Committee. . . ."
I The committee, unofficial till win-
I fcr quarter, will do its preliminary
I work immediately.
