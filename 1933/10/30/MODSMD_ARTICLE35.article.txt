# Is He Doomed?

Once proud n s I lie incarnation of that subtlety termed
"Stanford Spirit," the "rough" is becoming more and more
a legendary figure. The last boot in his unshaven face is
the policy of keeping him on the outside looking in at
campus dances. Where the gay light ends, there you will
find I hose roughs, in small silent groups—-pitiful, abject,
broken in spirit and refused at the gate.
I'art of his sad lot, the rough can attribute to his own
conduct; the rest is inflicted from above." The rough has
put on ;i necktie, and taken off his cords. He enters the
dunce and immediately passes like any old smoothie. He
has become the rough in wolfs clothing; he has ceased to
be a rough.
1»111 Ihc major cause is from above, wherein student
authorities bar roughs from the dances. At the Friday
dance, Ihe authorities outdid themselves in generosity:
loughs were permitted to enter at 12: lf> a.m.—fifteen min
utes before everything ended. Of course, if they wished
to pay twenty-five cents they could enter at eleven. Hut
roughs are notoriously llat; and a rough who has to pay
for Ihe largely vicarious enjoyment of watching the couples
dance is not worthy of the name.
Roughs are kept out, il is argued, because they spoil the
dance. This is based on the erroneous premise that if it
isn't like a city dance, it's no good. Rut it is just the pres
ence of roughs that adds enough to a campus dance to
make it worthwhile. We should encourage our refreshing
differences. And what is more refreshing than to have
one's masculine taste rewarded by a cutting rough.
Of course if roughs were to come in jollv-up numbers,
il would be unbearable, excusable to bar them. Hut the
small handfuls would harm no one, please roughs, please
all campus-appreciating paying customers.
The campus is a brief interlude before the commer
cialized realities of the big outside world. It is a grand
experience.
We should not try to model our affairs after a city
hotel. For one reason, we can't. The rafters in the gym
are always there. We can't afford a headlining orchestra,
sometimes gel something too much worse. Hut we can
have a happy comradeship which is better than all the
expensive trappings laid end to end, and then ballyhooed
lo Ihe skies.
That democratic spirit, often ridiculed, fast disappear
ing, can be maintained, is natural to this terrain. It will
be killed, however, if pennv-pinchers do not relent, allow
roughs to come within the sound of the bleating drums and
moaning saxophones.
