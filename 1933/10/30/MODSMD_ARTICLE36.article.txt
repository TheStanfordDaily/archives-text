This busy world: governments fall, thousands starve,
international co-operation collapses, and the I.C. students
petition for the return of freshman hazing.
Five hundred students are leading the determined drive
to revive hazing at Berkeley. The sixteen petitions being
circulated refer to a desire to institute "not the barbaric
hazing of years ago, but a milder and less injurious kind."
The Gal student body president is against the drive. lie
feels that hazing is liable to be discriminatory, but favors
class brawls as encouraging to a friendly spirit.
We are pleased to note that our scholastic friends
across the Hay are taking such a serious interest in the
larger problems of life.
Years ago Stanford gave up hazing. The junior colleges
and high schools are still holding on to it. C.al is lighting
hard to fall in line with the youngsters.
