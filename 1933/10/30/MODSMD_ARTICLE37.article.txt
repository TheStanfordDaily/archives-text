II ain't wrong anymore lo say "Me don't." This and
similar expressions, once severely frowned upon by school
ma'ams, are now perfectly grammatical. A recent con
gress of grammarians decided that henceforth many of the
widely used words and phrases which shock English in
structors are now perfectly proper.

is difficult to imagine Messrs. Patrick, Hayes, Winters, and
the other blue-penciling English C.oinp instructors passing

guage is a means of communication. It undergoes changes
as evolution proceeds. If the mass of the people find from

best transfer an idea from one person lo another, those
words and phrases should be taken into the language.
Too much attention is paid lo speaking grammatically.
Too often a student learns perfectly the grammar of a
foreign language, bill can say nothing in the foreign tongue
except something like "The hat of my aunt is on the table
