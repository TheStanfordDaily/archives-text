# BULL SESSION

Men are wonderful animals. They
can talk and write rhythmic poetry
and spit tobacco. They transcend
nature with their space-spanning
bridges; they thrill posterity with
their daintily-stained glass win
dows; they fly for burning days and
sleepless nights through the vault
of heaven; they read Walter Win
chell and attend walkathons. They
concoct traditions.
Perhaps the traditions make men
wonderful. Traditions are easy to
form. A few men start doing some
thing anc> the rest of mankind does
ditto.
Institutions are wonderful, too.
Stanford University is an institu
tion. The Concert Series is an in
stitution. They are fine and whole
some and even educational at times.
But dressing-up to attend Stan
ford concerts is a tradition. And like
many traditions it is based on the
paucity of intelligence of a few.
Stanford is, haberdasherly-speaking,
a rough school; the Concert Series
is, theoretically speaking, a Stanford
institution; the tradition of attend
ing concerts in suits and clean shirts
is, speeking any way, foolish.
Stanford concerts are held in the
basketball Pavilion. That building
with its crowded seats is adequate
for basketball. It is crude as a con
cert auditorium. Yet the crudeness
is brazenly emphasized by Stanford
men who undergo their bi-weekly
shave before attending concerts, by

1 Stanford women who don high heels
to keep their feet off the hardwood
floor.

"But," you squeal, "what of the
Palo Alto matrons who support the
concerts and must see Stanford at
its best?" What of them? Stanford
at its best is just plain Stanford, and
jusr plain Stanford wears cords and
dirty sweaters or skirts and clean
sweaters. Stanford appreciates Palo
Alto patrons, but even a Palo Alto
patron-matron dislikes to see a
ruddy - cheeked little Sequoiaite
squirm as the fuzz of unaccustomed
wool tickles the back ot his neck.
It would be fine if Stanford could
drop into the Pavilion from the libe
, and Row and the Halls to hear the
! concerts and then drop back to the
libe and the Union and Menlo. It
would be fine if the Concert Series
were as democratic as Stanford. It
is not so fine when Stanford, not
liking it, dresses to meet the tradi
! tion started by the paucity of in
| telligenee of a few.
This year's Concert Series prom
ises at least comparative financial
success. This year's Concert Series
' offers five fine artists whom Stan
lord can hear for less than the price
( of one San Francisco recital. This
i year's Concert Series would be a
j hell of a lot better if all traditions
; concerning traditions were broken
and the intelligent many attended
Stanford concerts as is.
