OLYMPIA (Molnar)
At the Fairmont Playhouse
Curiously enough, Olympia is bet
ter adapted for reading than for
performance. In a full production,
the flaws of awkward exposition in
the first act, long explanatory
speeches in all the acts, and almost
no physical action become too easily
apparent. But the play is saved by
the fortunate spacing of good dia
logue and genuinely humorous sit
uations, sometimes ironic, sometimes
farcial, and the creation, through
Gordon Davis's direction, of easy and
natural, though artificial, action.
The greatest entertainment value
of the evening (and I believe that I
can rate it thus exactly) was the
finished, polished, and perfect per
formance of Bertha Creighton as
Princess Plata-Ettingen, Olympia's
mother. It is sad when the best role
in a play does not call forth the
best performance, but when two
bests are combined, the result is de
lightful. Miss Creighton gave the
character dignified sweep, exquisite
subtlety and double entendre,
charming deviltry, delicious resigna
tion, warm vitality, and so on, and
so on. Nor—thank God—did she
overplay it. The Princess is funny
enough without exaggeration.
Baldwin McGraw as Prince Plata-
Ettingen, a more farcial character,
played briskly, broadly, and to good
effect. His makeup and his joviality
were especially good. Lois Austin
and William Kilby as Olympia and
Kovacs, the too serious young lov
ers, were rather cold in their first
scenes, but warmed nicely to their
second act climax. The rest of the
cast were bad.
The formal set, as well as the cos
tumes, was excellent, which, in the
case of Fred Stover, is rapidly be
coming a routine remark.

Mile. Lily Pons is the perfect ex
ample of that miracle of miracles,
the opera star who is not physically
miscast as the beautiful heroine, and
by the same token her Gallic charm
and graceful stage presence con
tributed materially toward the suc
cess of her recent concert program.
Singing before a capacity audi
ence, the French star was some
what hampered by a cold which

| caused a certain amount of strain on
the high notes, but it did not stifle
i the clarity, purity, and warmth of
tone which has always characteri
zed her work, and has been respon
sible for her meteoric rise to Met
ropolitan stardom.
Mile. Pons .is fundamentally a
technical singer* In showy pieces
requiring considerable virtuosity she
! has no equal in the coloratura so
prano field today. Wisely she fea
tured in her program such arias as
| "Caro Nome" from
the Mad Scene from "Lucia de Lam
mermoor," as well as the inevitable
| "Lo' Hear the Gentle Lark." Here
she was supreme, amazing and de
; lighting the audience with light—
! ning-swift changes from soft and
delicate tones to a clear, bell-like,
and absolutely true high E or F.
. She seemed less at home with the
1 simpler melodies which composed
j the first half of the program and be
long more exclusively to the concert
stage, than with her operatic selec
-1 tions.
Herbert Carrick proved himself an
able accompanist, capably interpret -
J ing two Chopin compositions. How
-1 ever, his encore, De Falla's "Ritual
Fire Dance," lacked the necessary
depth of interpretation. —Da hi

Curiously enough, Olympia is bet
ter adapted for reading than for
performance. In a full production,
the flaws of awkward exposition in
the first act, long explanatory
speeches in all the acts, and almost
no physical action become too easily
apparent. But the play is saved by
the fortunate spacing of good dia
logue and genuinely humorous sit
uations, sometimes ironic, sometimes
farcial, and the creation, through
Gordon Davis's direction, of easy and
natural, though artificial, action.
The greatest entertainment value
of the evening (and I believe that I
can rate it thus exactly) was the
finished, polished, and perfect per
formance of Bertha Creighton as
Princess Plata-Ettingen, Olympia's
mother. It is sad when the best role
in a play does not call forth the
best performance, but when two
bests are combined, the result is de
lightful. Miss Creighton gave the
character dignified sweep, exquisite
subtlety and double entendre,
charming deviltry, delicious resigna
tion, warm vitality, and so on, and
so on. Nor—thank God—did she
overplay it. The Princess is funny
enough without exaggeration.
Baldwin McGraw as Prince Plata-
Ettingen, a more farcial character,
played briskly, broadly, and to good
effect. His makeup and his joviality
were especially good. Lois Austin
and William Kilby as Olympia and
Kovacs, the too serious young lov
ers, were rather cold in their first
scenes, but warmed nicely to their
second act climax. The rest of the
cast were bad.
The formal set, as well as the cos
tumes, was excellent, which, in the
case of Fred Stover, is rapidly be
coming a routine remark.

Mile. Lily Pons is the perfect ex
ample of that miracle of miracles,
the opera star who is not physically
miscast as the beautiful heroine, and
by the same token her Gallic charm
and graceful stage presence con
tributed materially toward the suc
cess of her recent concert program.
Singing before a capacity audi
ence, the French star was some
what hampered by a cold which

| caused a certain amount of strain on
the high notes, but it did not stifle
i the clarity, purity, and warmth of
tone which has always characteri
zed her work, and has been respon
sible for her meteoric rise to Met
ropolitan stardom.
Mile. Pons .is fundamentally a
technical singer* In showy pieces
requiring considerable virtuosity she
! has no equal in the coloratura so
prano field today. Wisely she fea
tured in her program such arias as
| "Caro Nome" from
the Mad Scene from "Lucia de Lam
mermoor," as well as the inevitable
| "Lo' Hear the Gentle Lark." Here
she was supreme, amazing and de
; lighting the audience with light—
! ning-swift changes from soft and
delicate tones to a clear, bell-like,
and absolutely true high E or F.
. She seemed less at home with the
1 simpler melodies which composed
j the first half of the program and be
long more exclusively to the concert
stage, than with her operatic selec
-1 tions.
Herbert Carrick proved himself an
able accompanist, capably interpret -
J ing two Chopin compositions. How
-1 ever, his encore, De Falla's "Ritual
Fire Dance," lacked the necessary
depth of interpretation. —Da hi
