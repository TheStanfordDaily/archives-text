# 'CRITIC' RECALLS FOIBLES OF WELL KNOWN AESTHETES
## 
### James Sandoe 
In the production of "The Critic,"
and stressing his acute modernity,
the sharp-eyed playgoer may dis
cover several parodies of stage ce
lebrities and types in today's'theafre.
Marian Jones stalks majestically
about the .stage as Tilburina, moan
ing lines in a husky voice and wav
ing a handkerchief in the manner of
a famed American stage queen
whose carefully maintained legend
seems to remain after her real quali
ties have been discarded or lost in
boredom or indolence.
ttrauns Like Critic
Robert Brauns fusses continually
in a thoroughly simple-minded if
good-natured manner not unlike
that of a certain well known "dean"
of critics whose peculiarities find
some mention in the play's script.
But types as well as individuals
may be found in the twenty or more
characterizations in the play. There
is the ultra-heroic and absurdly
majestic Hero, the audience-con
scious Juvenile all of whose speeches
are directed at the third row center.
Even the seldom-seen powers of
th« backstage may be found. The
stage managing prompter, hard
boiled and belligerent, barks gruffly
at the agitated Author. Anyone who
has sought a stage door only to meet
with the cold and often forcible
manner in the union stage hand or
doorman will recognize this offensive
person at once.
Play Still Satire
And so, the audipnee which gath
ers in the Palo Alto Community
Theatre on Thursday evening, may
expect to find itself in the peculiar
position of viewing a play which,
although over a hundred and fifty
years old, is as sharply and appro
priately satiric as it was when Sheri
dan wrote it.
For the witty gentleman attacked
abuses which seem ever alive in the
theatre. And in the lines of the
play even more than in the charac
ters, theatre-goers will be amused
to see that blurbing, although dif
ferently named, was current before
1925, and that authors and actors
have changed comparatively little
through the centuries.
