# Two Air Crashes
## 
### 
Yesterday Texas and Massachu
setts had something in common,
probably for the first time. Air
crashes. In Mass., the plane unac
countably nose-dived from an alti
tude of 500 feet. In Texas, two cir
cus troupe planes collided, killing
three. Used to cinema crashes only,
one spectator described accident as
"beautiful."

A course for the use of those stu
dents preparing for the consular
service is being offered at Ihe Uni
versity of Georgia.
