## STANFORD, THE SCORELESS WONDERS 
### 
Our personal opinion decrces that
the sacred reign of El has not
long to live. Five stiff games stare
S.C. in Ihe face and if they can get
through Stanford, Oregon, Notre j
Dame, and Georgia and then beat
Washington in thsir last game of the
season—well, it's a lot to ask of any :
team.
Four touchdowns in five games— |
that's the record of Stanford's mag
nificient scoring machine that finally
fell afoul of its inability to make j
touchdowns and let a team slip over
a couple of field goals to win. There
is one thing a lot of people would
like to know; if it was a kicking |
game and Stanford was pushed right j
back on her heels by Husky punts,
why wasn't Frank Alustiza given a 1
chance? He was in the best of j
shape, and had been going great j
guns? in practice all week.
The U.S.C. and the Big Game look
bad for Stanford. There were two
good football teams battling in Cali- j
fornia Memorial Stadium Saturday.
Both of them have tricky, powerful !
offenses, with savage tackling and
defensive play; the Trojans get su- !
perlative blocking all of the time, ;
and California has it in spurts. The j
Bear tackles are strong, even;
stronger than the Trojans, Bright
and Harper.
And the old catch phrase that In- i
gram doesn't have an offense is pure j
hooey. California has a fast shift |
from a short punt into a single wing, :
that sometimes isn't a shift at all, 1
but a play. They v/ere flirting right
on the narrow edge of that one sec- j
ond stop rule, too. In fact, we be
lieve the referee might have called !
them more than once for violations j
of it. The Bears throw a lot of men j
into their interference, we don't
know just how many, but they surge
over tackle in a mass, and when
they do some ' blocking, the S.C. j
backs go to town.
