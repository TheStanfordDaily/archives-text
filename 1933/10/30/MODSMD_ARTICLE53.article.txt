# OUTPLAYED FROSH GRIDDERS LOSE TO SANTA CLARA 27-0
## 
### Charles Chappell 
Trying vainly to stop an endless
ind speedy array of Bronco ball —
uairiers, Stanford's out - manned
rosh grid team went down 27 to 0
sefore a powerful Santa Clara year
ing squad last Saturday afternoon
in the Stanford Stadium.
Not out-gained as much as the
score indicates, the Indian freshmen
look the opening kick-off and, with
Williams carrying the ball and pass
ing to Chouteau for several long
gains, were not stopped until they
reached the Santa Clara 25-yard
line. Two incomplete passes then j
wrote finis to the first Stanford
drive.
Two Strong Offenses
In an exclusively offensive game,
t his first ground-gaining spree is
typical of what followed. Stanford
piled up a big edge in first downs
bm couldn't cope with the long runs
bind sustained drive of the Santa
Clara team.
After stopping Stanford's opening
attack, the Broncs took the ball on
their own 33-yard line, tried a play
and failed to gain, then gave the
ball to Thomas who broke loose
around end and galloped 50 yards
Lo the Indians' 18 where he was fi
nally overhauled by Schott. Fala-
Gchi then passed to Finney for a
touchdown. The conversion failed.
Williams to Chouteau
The second quarter found Wil
liams again carrying the ball and
passing to Chouteau for a sustained
cirive from his own 28 to Santa
Clara's 16-yard line where an in
tercepted pass broke it up. A few
plays later Santa Clara staged a
long touchdown-resulting march,
featuring some fancy ball-packing
by Deßosa. The attempt to convert ■
again failed.
Santa Clara's third-quarter touch
down came when Finney intercepted
a pass on Stanford's 26 and Falaschi, >
after toting the ball on three or four
substantial gains, went over for six
more points, with the conversion ;
failing.
Reach 7-Yard Line
Later in the same quarter, Chuck
Ledbetter staged a single-handed
drive for Stanford that ended on
the Santa Clara 7-yard line, high
water mark of the Indian scoring
attack. All through the second half
Ledbetter's line plunges tore off
huge chunks of yardage for Stan
ford but none could be converted
into touchdowns.
A freak safety, resulting from ah '
attempted Stanford pass being batted j
20 yards into the end zone, gave 1
Santa Clara two more points in the
fourth quarter. A few minutes later
a long pass from Deßosa to Thomas
and an 11-yard plunge by Pifer gave
the Broncos another touchdown,
ending the day's scoring festivities. I
