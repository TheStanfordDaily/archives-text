trounced Calfiornia 20 to 5.
High point laurels for the evening
went to ex-Stanfordite Dick Criley.
now the mainstay of the Bear team.

team-mates to score a clean sweep
in his matches. Stanford Captain A1 j

! Snyder and Sophomore Peter Corn
wall won, respectively, four and
| three matches.
Stanford's other scorers were Ed
Munger, Mackenzie Gordon, and
Frank Dorsey, each of whom won
I two of his bouts.
Coach Elwyn Bugge expressed sat
isfaction for the impressive work
of two new additions to varsity
ranks. Louis Breitner, a transfer,
although losing his bout, showed
enough promise to warrant winning
performances in future competition, j
Gordon Williams, in his first fenc
ing under fire, also looked good to
[the coaches.
