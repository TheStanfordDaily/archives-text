Paul Painleve, French statesman
scientist, died yesterday. A war
premier, he again held that po
sition in 1925. He was Wilbur
Wright's first passenger in France
in 1908 and Albert Einstein's first
French interpreter. In 1924 he missed
the presidency by a narrow margin.
Credited for building up the French
Air Forces, he was Minister of Air
in the Herriot Cabinet.
