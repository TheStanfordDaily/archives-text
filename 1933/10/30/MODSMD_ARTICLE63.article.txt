### 
I Because of the unexpectedly early j
'tryouts for the Cambridge radio de- \
! bate, Public Forum's first session
j was postponed a week by the action
,of the organziing committee last ,
| night.
Cambridge tryouts have claimed
the time of one of the speakers
I scheduled, Fred Bold, to such an
I extent that he has been unable to j
l prepare himself for the planned 1
j l'ray; neither could an adequate |
j substitute be found to oppose
j George Shibley on such short
; notice.
Liquor or no liquor will still be j
the topic under file at next Mon
day's session, and hecklers from the [
floor will be allowed to run rife at j
Ihe discretion of the chairman. Hal |
von Breton, temporary president of !
the organization, will preside at the I
first meeting, handling the ropes on I
both sides of the "Resolved, that ;
| this house favors the prohibition of j
intoxicating liquors on the Stanford
| campus" question.
I One speaker on each side will j
j voice the chief issues, will take the
bombardment of floor-fanfares and;
answer them as best he can, which
will be followed by a procedure to
be announced later, and climaxed by
j a vole.
Certain of the rules already an
i nounced in the Daily have been al
tered, though not materially. Among
the opportunities for talk-minded
students will be short speeches from
the floor. All who wish to partici
pate in this capacity will communi
cate with Maxine Yaple, secretary,
