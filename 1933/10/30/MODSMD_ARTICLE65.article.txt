# Modernistic Decorations Planned for Social Events
## 
### 
Work has begun to secure artistic j
; decorations for dances and other so- ;
j cial events at Stanford at reduced I
j cost through the use of local talent,;
I says Les Hables, student manager.
Harold Helvenston, director of dra- j
matics, has consented to serve in an j
advisory capacity with such assist- ;
ants as James Algar, Thomas Stet- !
son, and Oliver Johnston.
Various codernistic schemes are J
J already being planned for campus
! dances. The first application of this i
: new art will be seen at the Enema
I Informal on November 17, at which
I! black and copper-colored designs
will be used in a modern motif.
