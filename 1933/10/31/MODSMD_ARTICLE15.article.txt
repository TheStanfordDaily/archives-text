Adventure and Science will be
J ship-mates of two Stanford men
when they sail December 15 with
j the Darwin Memorial Expedition
1 aboard the three-masted schooner
Golden State. By day, zoology stu
j dent Peter Doudoroff and Pro
i fessor Gordon F. Ferris of that de
partment will be sailors, directing
i the destinies of the ship in its two
i ;.nd a half year voyage. By night,
i ihey will be scientists, maneuvering
j microscopes instead of the wheel,
and studying animal life along the
1 South American coast.
Stanford is loaning Professor Fer
ris for research work in entomology,
and Doudoroff, whose father was an
admiral in the Russian navy during
the Kerensky regime, will work as
a zoologist. Twelve other sailor
j scientists, specializing in arehaeol

■ ogy, and botany, will comprise the
party.
The Golden State, now being out- |
fitted at Pier 19, is reminiscent of
old sea-faring days, and is the last
o£ the Alaska codfish schooners. She
, v/i 11 carry a captain, a first mate,
and a crew of five able seamen.
Directed by Victor Wolfgang von
Hagen, an independent scientist, Ihe !
expedition will first anchor at the '
Galapagos Islands to erect a memo- ;
rial to Charles Darwin who landed
there in 1835. The inscription was ]
written by Major Leonard Darwin, j
83, only living son of the scientist, j
The ship will then head for the '
Guatemalan coast where El Peten, j
a 75-mile long lake, will be investi- j
gated. A thrilling highlight of the
trip will be an attempted voyage by
way of Cape Horn,
