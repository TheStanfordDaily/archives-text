# 1932 FOOTBALL RECEIPTS SHOW GREAT DECLINE
## Report Shows Drop of 50 per Cent from High Point of 1929 
### 
King Football took it on the nose
at Stanford last year when grid
receipts fell off approximately 40
per cent as compared with the
revenue for the 1931 season. Ex
actly $250,272.72 was all that the
last Warner-coached team earned
for its Alma Mater, according
to figures obtained from the
B.A.C. which are to be included
in the coming issue of the Presi
dent's Report.
Receipts for the 1931 season
amounted to $417,451.93. The high
point in football history here was in
1929 when a depression-proof pub
iic paid $499,822.37.
1933 Better?
While last year's football receipts
approached the 1924 level, Ticket
Manager Jake Irwin sees encourage
ment in the present season, due to
an increase in the sales for prelimi
nary games.
Just what kind of a crowd will be
attracted to Stanford for the Big
Game, the major home attraction for
this year, he could not prcdict. Said
he: "Applications from alumni arc
coming in very well, and many stu
dents have bought tickets here aside
from their rooter's tickets."
Irwin predicts the graduated scale
of prices for the Big Game which
offers tickets for either $4 or $3,
will be retained in the future.
"I imagine we will eventually get
back to the $5 price with cheaper
seats in sections A, AA, and ZZ."
This year these sections as well as
the first 17 rows in W. X, Y, Z, and
I, J, K, L, M, N, will sell for $3, the
lowest Big Game price of recent
years.
Change Sides
Irwin smilingly commented on the
annual "dog fight over who gets the
shady side."
"This year Stanford will be in the
sun, occupying sections C to K. As
a visiting team, we are usually given
the shady side, and there is always
an argument when colleges who
play here have to sit in the sun."
Irwin could not estimate the size
of the probable crowd at the U.S.C.
game as nine-tenths of the seats for
it are being sold by the southern
university. So far, only 9,000 tickets
have been sold through his B.A.C.
office, 900 of these being for the stu
dent rooting section.

play here have to sit in the sun."
Irwin could not estimate the size
of the probable crowd at the U.S.C.
game as nine-tenths of the seats for
it are being sold by the southern
university. So far, only 9,000 tickets
have been sold through his B.A.C.
office, 900 of these being for the stu
dent rooting section.
King Football took it on the nose
at Stanford last year when grid
receipts fell off approximately 40
per cent as compared with the
revenue for the 1931 season. Ex
actly $250,272.72 was all that the
last Warner-coached team earned
for its Alma Mater, according
to figures obtained from the
B.A.C. which are to be included
in the coming issue of the Presi
dent's Report.
Receipts for the 1931 season
amounted to $417,451.93. The high
point in football history here was in
1929 when a depression-proof pub
iic paid $499,822.37.
1933 Better?
While last year's football receipts
approached the 1924 level, Ticket
Manager Jake Irwin sees encourage
ment in the present season, due to
an increase in the sales for prelimi
nary games.
Just what kind of a crowd will be
attracted to Stanford for the Big
Game, the major home attraction for
this year, he could not prcdict. Said
he: "Applications from alumni arc
coming in very well, and many stu
dents have bought tickets here aside
from their rooter's tickets."
Irwin predicts the graduated scale
of prices for the Big Game which
offers tickets for either $4 or $3,
will be retained in the future.
"I imagine we will eventually get
back to the $5 price with cheaper
seats in sections A, AA, and ZZ."
This year these sections as well as
the first 17 rows in W. X, Y, Z, and
I, J, K, L, M, N, will sell for $3, the
lowest Big Game price of recent
years.
Change Sides
Irwin smilingly commented on the
annual "dog fight over who gets the
shady side."
"This year Stanford will be in the
sun, occupying sections C to K. As
a visiting team, we are usually given
the shady side, and there is always
an argument when colleges who
play here have to sit in the sun."
