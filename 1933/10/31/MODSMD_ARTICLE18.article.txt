# Record Sales Reported for Shaw Drama
## Lowest Scale of Prices In History Will Prevail 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
It's no news that the Dramatic
Council is producing Bernard Shaw's
"Aims and the Man" on Friday
night, and it is also probably not
news that there are still seats avail
| able for the performance.
But it is news and also the truth
i (for those who differentiate) that
j the current seat sale, with its re
j duced prices, is setting all manner
| of records as to low prices, number
|of tickets sold, and rapidity with
i which the seats were snatched up.
Ben Cave, Dramatic Manager, con
tributed the above announcement
I with some pride, and with the state-
I ment that seats may still be obtained
;at the Dramatic Council office, Old
! Union, "while they last." With a
i minimum of locations at $1, the ma
| jority of the seats are being dis
; posed of at the newly-established
! 75-cent figure.
Meanwhile, gairly-colored posters
I depicting highlights of the Shaw
j show have been distributed with
| abandon about the campus, and are
| designed to lure a goodly number
to the Assembly Hall to watch Mary
Anita Loos, John Peckham, Paul
Crary, Jean Albertson, Virginia
Marvin, George Leavens, Waldo
Salt, and George Fuller.
