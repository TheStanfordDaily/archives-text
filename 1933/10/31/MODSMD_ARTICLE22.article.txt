# VAN WAGENEN, ROGERS TO BE RADIO DEBATERS
## Judge Chooses Pair Late Last Night; Kay Is Alternate 
### 
A few minutes before the
"Daily" went to press iast night,
it was announced that Dick Van
Wagcnen, former member of the
"Daily'' staff, and Bill Rogers,
son of Will Rogers, movie star,
had been chosen to represent
Stanford in the radio debate
with Cambridge University.
Ronald Kay was named as al
ternate.

Impressed with the gravity of I
their task, five judges filed into an |
English corner room yesterday af- j
ternoon and for two hours they sat |
before a loud speaker, listened to
numbered but nameless voices.
Voice number 15 stopped, the am
plifier was still. The judges went
into a huddle, attempting to select ,
two men to radio debate with !
Cambridge University. The huddle j
became a conference, a deadlock!
resulted. Meeting adjourned, the
judges decided to sleep over the l
matter, render decision this morn
ing at 9 o'clock.
Weeding Out
Before deadlock developed, judges |
eliminated all undergraduates but j
numbers 7, 2, 11, all graduates but
numbers 5, 10.
Judges agreed that one of the ;
graduates is a better radio speaker j
lhan any of the undergraduates. The
hard nut to crack was: Should a j
graduate student be used, thus en
hancing Stanford's case or should '
Stanford's chances be jeopordized at ;
the expense of keeping the affair
strictly for non-degree students.
While judges worried, four de
baters started to polish up argu
ments they will employ against j
California women who will appear
in the Little Theatre at 7:30 o'clock
Thursday night and also against an- 1
other team at Berkeley on the same
night.
Millard to Preside
Chairwoman on the Little Theatre
platform will be Associated Women j
Student's President Jeanne Millard, i
Noteworthy is the courtesy of Stan
ford men debaters in choosing a
v/oman chairwoman to help Califor
nia women feel at ease on a foreign
rostrum.
The debate will be anything but a
discussion of a mere academic ques
tion. It is: "Resolved, that this house
favors absolute freedom of speech."
Even conservatives realize that the
subject presents opportunity for ad
i ministration "panning" under formal
guise.'

A few minutes before the
"Daily" went to press iast night,
it was announced that Dick Van
Wagcnen, former member of the
"Daily'' staff, and Bill Rogers,
son of Will Rogers, movie star,
had been chosen to represent
Stanford in the radio debate
with Cambridge University.
Ronald Kay was named as al
ternate.

Impressed with the gravity of I
their task, five judges filed into an |
English corner room yesterday af- j
ternoon and for two hours they sat |
before a loud speaker, listened to
numbered but nameless voices.
Voice number 15 stopped, the am
plifier was still. The judges went
into a huddle, attempting to select ,
two men to radio debate with !
Cambridge University. The huddle j
became a conference, a deadlock!
resulted. Meeting adjourned, the
judges decided to sleep over the l
matter, render decision this morn
ing at 9 o'clock.
Weeding Out
Before deadlock developed, judges |
eliminated all undergraduates but j
numbers 7, 2, 11, all graduates but
numbers 5, 10.
Judges agreed that one of the ;
graduates is a better radio speaker j
lhan any of the undergraduates. The
hard nut to crack was: Should a j
graduate student be used, thus en
hancing Stanford's case or should '
Stanford's chances be jeopordized at ;
the expense of keeping the affair
strictly for non-degree students.
While judges worried, four de
baters started to polish up argu
ments they will employ against j
California women who will appear
in the Little Theatre at 7:30 o'clock
Thursday night and also against an- 1
other team at Berkeley on the same
night.
Millard to Preside
Chairwoman on the Little Theatre
platform will be Associated Women j
Student's President Jeanne Millard, i
