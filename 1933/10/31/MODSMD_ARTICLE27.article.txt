# Library Exhibits Works Of Bert, French Scholar
## 
### 
Physiologist-statesman Paul Bert,
French scholar of the nineteenth
century, is honored this month in a
display in the Stanford Library
mezzanine floor of his books, papers,
and articles concerning his life.
Dr. Bert, whose centenary was
celebrated in France during the past
month, is little known in this coun
try outside of his field. As a writer
he published many works on sub
jects ranging from mathematics texts
to medical discourses and treatises
on political theory. In politics, he
was a leader, said by some to be a
second Voltaire.
