Bccau.se they didn't look like foot
ball men, two grid managers and a
Goof player, stowaways aboard the
gravy train bound for the Wash
ington game, were caught by ihe
big, bad, S.P. representative at Eu
gene, Oregon.
Junior Managers Oliver Johnston
;.nd Hobart Batson, and Goof George
Leedy are the culprits who arrived
yesterday on the campus declaring
it was worth it even if they did have
to pay their own fares back.
Clad in official red coats, bor
rowed from team members who were
accomplices in the conspiracy, the
trio confidently boarded the train at
Palo Alto. Arriving at San Fran
cisco, they scorned the special taxis
awaiting the griddcrs and crossed
city and bay under their own power
and cash.

! For the first 30 miles out of Oak- I
land, the stowaways found the men's |
washroom the most auspicious place |
to hide, but after that, by mingling
with the team and having meals ,
I separately, success seemed assured.
Their denoument came at Eugene,
when the team ran signals and 12
men to a squad did not suit train
officials. "Sure, we knew it all I
along. You fellows don't look like !
players," said he to the chagrined |
stowaways.
Impressions of the game received
by the stowaways: "It was all wet.
About 650,000 drops of water fell
every second. The football field in
cluded a broad jump pit, two feet
deep in water, and every time a
player fell in it, he was completely
lost from sight."
