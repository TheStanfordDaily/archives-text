### 
A final .social tribute to the tra
j dition-breaking body of individuals
known as tile new women—the All—
| New-Women jolly-up. The beams
;of the acoustically fine basketball
j pavilion will re-echo ihe shuffling
!of feet, the harmonies of modern
; rhythm, the soft whispers of danc
| ing couples when new women and
I Stanford men meet tonight to enjoy
an hour snatched from studious
| cares of the day.
It will be held from 7 to 8 o'clock
j with the aid of Gordon Heche's six
j man band.
The A.S.S.U. ex-committee student
'committee chairman, Bill Morse,
;Piesident Justine Jankowsky of the
1 Union Club, and Roble and Encina
; sponsors have joined efforts to offer
i to the new women their final debut
I to Stanford society.
"Tlie '500' have gone; the '800'
arc here," said Morse. "Tonight
the old roughs have their chance
to compare the new product with
I the old. Fraternity, club, hall, and
I off-campus men should go to the
Pavilion and find*out if they are
worth our trouble. I think'they
| are."
i The Union president gives the
feminine opinion, thus: "The new
| transfer women students from cam
puses all over 1 his country are will-
I mg to give the older men a break,
j We are inviting every Stanford man
!to be present at our Hallowe'en
| dance. Come and enjoy yourselves
I for an hour of carnival fun."
Yell Leader A1 Peache with his
! able assistants, Jim Triolo and Ay
j lctt Cotton, will act as masters of
; ceremonies. They will demand a
j change of partners every two or
i three dances.
