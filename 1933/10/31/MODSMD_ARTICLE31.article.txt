# Troy Journalists Will Publish Scandal Sheet
## 
### 
The "Vulture," new S.C. razz
sheet, shows up on the Coliseum-
Fhaded campus tomorrow. Trojan
Daily members will hawk the rag,
costumed, capering. Razz news will
be typically S.C.-ish, juicy, "based
on the truth but augmented by ru
mor." Wonder many: what will
lion-mained dirt - suppressor von
Klein-smid do about it?
Well known is the long-haired
man's clean mind, his horrible habit
of pulling whole quartos out of
Wampus, inclined to be filthy, never
sweet humor magazine.
