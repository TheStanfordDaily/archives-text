As nil know, the Stanford varsity went to Washington,'
saw, did not conquer. And what difference should that |
make? The men prohahlv exerted themselves to Ihe ut
most. And if they hadn't, it would be unfair to blame them.
The field was a sea of mud, practically just a sea.
Hut many fuzzy minded souls on this campus are in a |
stale of queer agitation because we lost. They have been j
in this state for the last 72 hours, will probably remain in 1
a similar state until the next game.
The whole emphasis seems to be on winning the game. ,
A player is a hero if he scores or blocks, as the case may
be, and is a chump if he fails in these endeavors, The same
holds for the attitude towards the whole team. If they
win, the campus is down 011 its knees in loud praise and
abject worship. If they lose, the same campus ups its nose.
Our attitude remains the same in either case. That seems
sensible for football is a game, not a determined effort
to Will.
But football as a sport is being forgotten, actually for- i
gotten. Energetic rally committeemen run hither and yon
to drag us out to rallies and games so "that the team will
w in." Did anyone ever consider asking us out to a rally ,
because they are often a lot of fun? Did anyone ever con
sider that a football game is a pleasant thing to watch, no j
matter who wins?
No, the American genius for producing results has in
fected on this front as 011 all others. Mere sport is too
pointless. There must be a purpose. The purpose is to!
win. So the rah rah boys find a purpose for their yelling: '
support for a winning team. The whole thing becomes a
bit ludicrous. How 2,000 in the section rather than 1,000 or
50 or one will make our men kick farther, run faster, or*
block harder is hard to see.
And what difference if they fail in each of these de
partments? If they enjoy playing, and we enjoy watching
them play, tiiat should be sufficient. That is suflicient but
for two exceptions: first, the rah rah lads place so much
emphasis 011 the game that a loss is a national calamity;
and second, many of the boys don't enjoy playing because 1
so much drive is placed on winning.

And what difference if they fail in each of these de
partments? If they enjoy playing, and we enjoy watching
them play, tiiat should be sufficient. That is suflicient but
for two exceptions: first, the rah rah lads place so much
emphasis 011 the game that a loss is a national calamity;
and second, many of the boys don't enjoy playing because 1
so much drive is placed on winning.
As nil know, the Stanford varsity went to Washington,'
saw, did not conquer. And what difference should that |
make? The men prohahlv exerted themselves to Ihe ut
most. And if they hadn't, it would be unfair to blame them.
The field was a sea of mud, practically just a sea.
Hut many fuzzy minded souls on this campus are in a |
stale of queer agitation because we lost. They have been j
in this state for the last 72 hours, will probably remain in 1
a similar state until the next game.
The whole emphasis seems to be on winning the game. ,
A player is a hero if he scores or blocks, as the case may
be, and is a chump if he fails in these endeavors, The same
holds for the attitude towards the whole team. If they
win, the campus is down 011 its knees in loud praise and
abject worship. If they lose, the same campus ups its nose.
Our attitude remains the same in either case. That seems
sensible for football is a game, not a determined effort
to Will.
But football as a sport is being forgotten, actually for- i
gotten. Energetic rally committeemen run hither and yon
to drag us out to rallies and games so "that the team will
w in." Did anyone ever consider asking us out to a rally ,
because they are often a lot of fun? Did anyone ever con
sider that a football game is a pleasant thing to watch, no j
matter who wins?
No, the American genius for producing results has in
fected on this front as 011 all others. Mere sport is too
pointless. There must be a purpose. The purpose is to!
win. So the rah rah boys find a purpose for their yelling: '
support for a winning team. The whole thing becomes a
bit ludicrous. How 2,000 in the section rather than 1,000 or
50 or one will make our men kick farther, run faster, or*
block harder is hard to see.
And what difference if they fail in each of these de
partments? If they enjoy playing, and we enjoy watching
them play, tiiat should be sufficient. That is suflicient but
for two exceptions: first, the rah rah lads place so much
emphasis 011 the game that a loss is a national calamity;
and second, many of the boys don't enjoy playing because 1
