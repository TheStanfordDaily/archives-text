# Calling: All Men

Beneath our very noses, 8(H) women have invaded the
Farm. Ihe invasion lias been most peaceful and the in
vaders have settled down, had an open house, and now
choose to associate with the conquered natives who once
roamed free and proud over these foothills.
We conquered ones are given our last opportunity to
night to meet these queens at the New Women's Jolly-up
at the Pavilion. This is a grand opportunity for the pants
wearers. In the past, the "n()0, M ever conscious of their
mathematical superiority (rare things being superior; ex.:
radium, the ";">()()"), were inclined, rumor had it, to place
an inflated worth on their company. Result: foggy pil
grimages to .Mills and Berkeley.
Rut a new day has dawned, and what a dav! It seems
that cowed Stanford men have been neglecting these new
women. It now seems that these new women are anxious
to meet us meaning the men generally. They shall not he
disappointed, even though it takes two squads to control
Hie mob.
