For the benefit of some 2000 new students who have
come to this famed institution for the poor man, we beg
their indulgence in revering one of the better traditions
for which 111e Farm is noted. We refer to the old Stanford
custom of giving your neighbor a lift into Paly or out to
the campus when you see him standing at any of the
familiar spots.
In case you are one of the 2000 who isn't familiar with
the spots, the boys are on several of 'em. There's the one
by the Palo Alto depot, another just west of the Knglish
corner at the intersection, and a third where Palm Drive
divides to encircle the sunken gardens.
There are numerous others, and there generally is room
enough in roadsters, sedans, and coupes to allow an 1111-
nulocd Indian to squeeze in. You might as well spend a
few seconds picking him up as waiting for the traffic signal
at the highway to turn green.
