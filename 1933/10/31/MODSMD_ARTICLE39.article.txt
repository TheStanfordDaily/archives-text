I VIV WEAKNESS (Fox)
At the Stanford Theatre
Well, Europe has contributed an
i other leader of men to our cinema.
Much tutored, much ballyhooed Lil
ian Harvey makes her debut in a
1 picture which attempts to set her
up as the female Chevalier, and (as
j a local dramatic empress remarked)
I she "out-Gaynors Miriam Hopkins."
Fox has, iri short, tried to invest
j Miss Harvey's performance with all
the glamor and combined dramatic
abilities of a galaxy of Hollywood's
chief charmers. And—if Lubitsch or
Mamoulian had been chosen to di
rect thq vehicle we might have had
a second "Trouble in Paradise,"
possessing unusual dialogue and
song numbers, this picture could
have been equally outstanding.
But—the director has forced into
his production all the music, rhyth
mic dialogue, satire, burlesque, and
sentimentality that he could, and the
result is an unnoyingly slow tempo,
Inconsistent continuity, combined
with a weak plot, are added to this.
The nephew of a maker of bras
sieres, in order to regain his lost
inheritance, bets his foundation
garment-producing uncle that he
can marry off the hotel maid (Har
vey) to whomever he chooses. Miss
Harvey, in the process of recon
struction, is offered some perfect
comedy situations and a chance to
show off Hollywood's flamboyant fi
nery. She falls' for nephew, uncle
falls for her, she wins nephew, and
Cupid (yes! there's even a cupid,
portrayed by Harry Langdon) re
marks, "Well, that was a tough one,
but I did it!" A song, introduced
under the nauseating title of "Gather
Lip Rouge While "You May," proves
to be tuneful and catchy. And
hlinking Charles Butterworth as the
philatelic, carrot-eating half-wit
turns in his usual priceless per
formance. —Brill

I GOLDEN HARVEST and
FLYING DEVILS
At the Varsity Theatre
An epic of the soil and of two
brothers who saved the farm for the
farmer, "Golden Harvest," is Holly
wood's attempt to bridge the gap
between the stock market and th:>
farmer. * Two brothers, born and
raised on the farm, separate and go
then ways—Chester Morris to the
city, and Richard Arlen to the land.
Starting off slowly with the in
evitable panorama of farm, wheat,
reaper, etcetera, the play drags
throughout. The emotional heights
are not built up to, and consequently
miss fire. The humor is picturesque,
rural, and badly second hand.
Roscoe Ates as the old farm hand
does little to enliven the evening.
Some contrast was displayed in the
characterizations of the two broth
ers; Richard Arlen as the farmer
was perfectly cast and played well,
while Chester Morris was able as
the city slicker. However, it was a
little hard to imagine the two as
brothers. Genevieve Tobin looked
pretty, which was all she had to do.
"Flying Devils" proves to be an
aeroplane story, done in the manner
of a western. The climax of the ac
tion is a battle in the air between
three pilots: A chases B, and C
chases B, to keep him from catching
i up with A, whose parachute is cut.
If you like moviegoing and predict
ing what will happen, see this by all
' means: you'll never be wrong.
' The players all had an uphill fight,
i with Ralph Bellamy trying hard,
I despite being miscast. "Ace" Bruce
| Cabot did his role in the spirit of the
ishow, and Eric Linden and Arline
! Judge provided negligible love in
terest in stupid situations. The only
spark of interest in the affair was
Cliff Edwards, who squeezes meagre
iaughs out of unhumorous lines.
