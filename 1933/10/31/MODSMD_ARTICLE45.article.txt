Editor of the Daily, Sir:
I wish to call attention of Stanford
students to the absurdity of yester
day's Bull Session.
It is true that our Pavilion is
hardly an appropriate hall for the
purpose of the Concert Series, but
to suggest that Stanford students,
enhance its defects by appearing as
a motley collection of unshaven
zoological curiosities is entirely
without sense or even humor.
The Concert Series, forced as it is
to make shift with the Pavilion in
order to accommodate the number
of people who patronize our con
certs, does everything in its power
in the way of lighting and unosten
tatious and acoustical decoration to
soften the contours and eliminate
the natural barrenness of a basket
bail pavilion. They have every right
to expect co-operation of their pa
trons in giving a great artist the
suiroundings to which he is accus
tomed.
It is a very deeply rooted tradi
tion that great music be accom
panied by the respect evidenced in
the wearing of proper dress, the gal
lery of Aida and Lucia not with
standing. The Stanford Pavilion has
no gallery, and the Stanford tradi
j tion, were it at the peak of its glory
instead of a smile provoking anec

dote, would be as important as
Calehas beside Achilles compared
with the musical tradition.
It is silly to raise one's eyebrows
at a pair of corduroys at a concert,
since a certain number of people
will attend in such garb anyway,
many of them with legitimate rea

son, but to attempt to make our
roughs' beaid and corduroys a cus
tom at such an affair is a ghastly
example of deficient reasoning. If
Mr. Strouse will Ret in touch with
me I shall be glad to furnish him
with a razor blade.
