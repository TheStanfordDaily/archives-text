## OREGON WEBFEET OUT IN FRONT 
### 
With the first half of the Pacific
Coast football season now history,
the Conference race which always
resolves itself into a game of "But
ton, button, who can button up the
Trojans," has become a very merry
mixup indeed.
The Oregon Webfeet have been
paddling along in the tall grass so
unobtrusively that it is with a shock
that we see them strutting along at
the head of the pack, with three vic
tories and no defeats or ties. Ore
gon stands at present with a good
chance of winning the Conference,
although it has mighty Troy and
Oregon State to conquer.
With five hard games, which in
clude three Conference struggles, it
does not look like so good for El
Trojan. If Jones and his men can
escape from that gantlet unscathed,
more power to 'em.
