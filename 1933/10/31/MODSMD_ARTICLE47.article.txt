# WISE MONEY IS WITH OREGON STATE
## 
### 
But Oregon State's Beavers, who
to our knowledge haye never won
a Conference title, at least in recent
years, are,in a sweet pot to turn the
trick this year. All O.S.C. has to do
is knock their neighbors from Eu
gene off tho top and the worst they
can get is a tie with U.S.C. And
then, my fran', if Stanford, or Ore
gon, or Washington can crimp the
Trojan horse's tail, Oregon State's
possession of the title will be un
disputed. It looks like a good year
for the State of Oregon.
