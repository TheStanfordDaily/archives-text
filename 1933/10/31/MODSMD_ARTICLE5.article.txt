### 
Arms Conference is weary, wait
ing, wondering what Germany's
N;<zi Government is going to do,
what will be done about that. Steer
jug Committee, supposedly holding
the arms fort till December 4th
when the Conference convenes again,
puts off another meeting.
American Arms Envoy Davis,
seeing all other delegates rushing
off to consult their governments,
thinks he'd better talk it over with
F.R. and Secretary Hull, who's going
good-willing in South America.
Questions he will ask: shall the
Powers go ahead, make agreements
without Germany? Will U.S. agree
to mere holding of armaments, land
and sea, to status quo without re
duction?
Meanwhile there are slow, sad
days in Geneva. Japan is with
drawing from active discussion, will
wait, then either accept or reject.
