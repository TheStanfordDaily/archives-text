# VARSITY GRIDDERS BEGIN PRACTICING FOR O.C. CONTEST
## 
### Spud Hamilton 
The Stanford varsity, like Old
black Joe, came home yesterday
with their heads a-bendin' low,
bowed down hut not at all dis
heartened, they enjoyed a holiday
from practice and today will start
the grind that they hope will cul
minate in a victory over U.S.C.
For despite their smasluip at Se
attle, the team expects nothing
else but fair sailing against Troy.
Although he offered no alibi,
Coach "Tiny" Thomhill succinctly
summed up last Saturday when he
declared, "And we didn't have a man
that could swim a hundred yards."
Washington was admittedly a great
team against the Indians and fully
deserved to win, although rabid
Slanfordites could not help thinking
what would have been the odds had
they played the game on a dry, fast
field.
Deep Mud, Pools
According to Coach Thornhill, the
field was fully covered by an inch
and a half of water that became
fairly deep pools along the sidelines
near the vaulting and jumping run
ways. It was the same old bugaboo
faced by every California team that
journeys to the watery Northwest.
Washington had a great line on
the field; a line that consistently
out charged the Indians. Washing
ton did not have much in the way
oi' offense; it seemed impossible for
them to score through the Stanford
line, but no touchdowns were
needed.
Stanford was hesitant and con
servative, kicking on third down al
ways, and sticking to the straightest
01 straight stuff. After a bad break
had put them in the hole to start
the game, the magic punting of Matt
Muczynski held them there all
afternoon.
Maentz Hurt Early
Bob Maentz was hurt early in the
[game and Johnny Reisner replaced
I him. Reisner is a sweet player on
I a dry field, but his whirling, twist
ing style was never meant for a mud
track. Maentz will be out of the
Olympic Club game with a sore
ankle, but he will undoubtedly be
in shape for U.S.C.
li was homecoming week for
Huskies and they made the most
of it in the way of high spirits and
determination to win. On the other
extreme, Stanford was afraid of
the wet ball, afraid to open up
and shoot the works. After they
had seen Sim, Afllerbaugh, and
Reisner stumbling when they at
; temped to cut on the turf that
wasn't turf, and after Bill Bates
had flung the soggy ball away
from the backs on bad passes a
couple of times, Stanford's highly
developed sense of timing was
lost. The blockers were away too
fast, and the ball carriers were
frequently smeared.
