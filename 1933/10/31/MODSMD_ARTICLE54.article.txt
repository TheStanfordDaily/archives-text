# Alarm Serenade Is Due In Citizenship Lecture
## 
### 
Tradition decrees the ringing of:
alarms every year during one of the j
Citizenship lectures. Points of van- |
tage are selected on the balcony of
the Assembly Hall; alarm clocks are
placed at the aforementioned points,
each clock set to go off at intervals
throughout the lecture.
Freshmen, embryo roughs, are re
sponsible for this particular form of
heckling which, as yet, the admin
istration has been unable to control.
Guest lecturers, from the various
departments, weekly address Citi
zenship students on timely topics.
These guest lecturers are, it is said,
becoming nervous, as the years roll
by and the ringing of annual alarms
continues. Endeavoring to turn the
neat phrase, to make the quotable
remark, to illustrate the abstract
conception, these gentlemen react
unfavorably to this customary
tinkle-tinkle.
Such interruption has not as yet
occurred this year. At present, odds
are quoted at 10-1 that it will come
off next week. Just another Stan
ford tradition. . . . What Cards these
freshmen be!
