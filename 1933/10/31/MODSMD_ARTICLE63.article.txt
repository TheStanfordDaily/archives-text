## 
### 
For the benefit of the clamoring
hordes of students who so far have
failed to materialize, the Stanford
i Bookstore once again announces the
j installation of a circulating library.
| Subject matter ranges from the
i lightest of contemporary novels to
valuable supplementary references,
all available at ihe nominal fee of
five cents daily.
No time limit is placed on with
drawals, which are expected to be
more frequent since the enlargement
of the Store's literary facilities.
