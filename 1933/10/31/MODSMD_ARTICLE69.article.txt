# WATER POLOISTS TO PLAY ATHENS CLUB TOMORROW
## 
### 
Tomorrow night Stanford's water
polo team travels to Oakland to
meet the Athens Club, last year's
Northern California Water Polo
League runners-up.
League-champion Stanford faces
its toughest competitor for a season
opener since the club team boasts
such greats as Jim McKay and Boyn
ton Kaiser.
No scoreless wonders, the Cards
showed real strength Friday by rid
ing through an alumni team com
posed of such stars as Austin Clapp
and Fred Fletcher to the tune of
8-2. Stanford's real star in this game
was Leo Cook, goalie, who withstood
) all but two of the old men's throws.
In the last year's competition
Stanford whipped the Athens Club
5-2, and 7-4, with Ted Wiget doing
! more than his share to thump the
clubmen. This year's worry: Can
the team do it without him?
Worried Coach Thornton worries,
'"the defense is good, but it is the
offense which is causing me trouble.
Illness hiis hampered us from dc
i veloping a real scoring punch."
Water polo's junior varsity will
clash with the Athens juniors in a
preliminary game.
