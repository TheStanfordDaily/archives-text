# Offer Organ Recital Today
## 
### Will Williams 
Autumn Romance and Hallowe'en
will be the themes predominant in
University Organist Warren D. Al
len's recital at 4:15 o'clock this after
noon. Two pieces, of a religious na
ture, will emphasize "All Soul's
Day," which is of particular interest.
In times past, the year was di
vided into two sections, one of them
beginning with May Day and the
other with All Soul's Day, "so the
day is really a sort of New Year's
celebration," according to Allen. It
is for this reason that the spirit
exercising ceremonies and the custo
mary Hallowe'en pranks are per
formed.
Having both religious and histo
rical significance, All Soul's Day is
j* holiday in most European coun
tries. For this reason the two mu
sical selections are being featured,
particularly the one by Schubert,
together with the two which intro
duce the autumn motif. "I try to
give my programs a topical and sea
sonal significance;"" Allen explained.
"And nothing pleases me more than
to have students critical of them."

The afternoon organ recitals, given
in the Memorial Church at 4:15
o'clock, are a Stanford tradition
which has been upheld ever since
Mrs. Stanford planned the church
for the center of the Quad. Fre
quently featuring artists of consid
erable repute, the concerts have
built up a wide and faithful audi
ence which Mr. Allen hopes will in
crease.
