# 'Critic' Cast To Feature Card Talent
## 
### James Sandoe 
Many of the actors in the modern
j dress production of Sheridan's thea
: trical satire, "The Critic; or A Trag
edy Rehears'd," to be presented on
Thursday evening by the Palo Alto
J Community Players, are eompara
: tively inexperienced but demon
strate considerable abilities.
James Broughton, who plays Dan
j gle, has been heard in several of
the Sword and Sandals readings,
' notably in "The Duchess of Malfi,"
! and had a bit in the production of
"An Enemy of the People" last
I winter.
Broughton Good
He is doing a remarkable piece
; of woi'k in "The Critic," building a
| character with subtle pantomime as
well as through his intelligent read
j ing of the lines. He has a lightness
J of approach which is remarkable in
| view of his comparatively slight ex
perience and promises to stand high
j in the audience's favor.
Dick Dawson, also seen momen
tarily in "An Enemy of the People,"
I plays the Beefeater with a tremen
dous zest and displays an acute com
edy sense which should offer a good
j many chuckles. Andrews Harris, the
| Don Ferolo Whiskerandos, has never
j appeared in a Stanford production
! although he has been seen in two
! readings. His majestic but inter
cepted death scene in the last act
of "The Critic," following a fierce
j duel with Beefeater Dawson, is an
| other comedy high point.
Experienced Actors
j Of the more experienced actors in
I the cast Robert Brauns rushes about
I delectably, Bob Balzer fumes to the
i glee of such spectators as have been
present at rehearsal;.. The diverse
j Myna Hughes plays Mrs. Dangle de
■ cisively; Henry Brill stamps and
i gestures broadly in a key totally
| different to that in which he played
' the shifty newspaperman in "An
! Enemy of the People." Ethel Urmy
Kempston, an unexpected "find"
j with some past experience, pipes
| woefully as the pathetic Justice's
: Lady and Marian Jones again dis
| plays a nice burlesque ability as Til
; burina, which recalls certain of the
j broader moments of her portrayal
| oi' Linda in Barry's '"Holiday" here
i earlier this year.
Only clear-sighted character in
j the play, except perhaps the bored
1 actors who occasionally raise re
! volts on their own, is Mr. Sneer.
| Curt Zimansky who plays this role
I has been seen in at least one hilari
| ous role, that of Throttiebotlorn in
| the reading of the satiric '"Of Thee
i I Sing." He has aided in the direc
, tion of more than one of the subse
quent readings, occasionally taken
: part in them.

Experienced Actors
j Of the more experienced actors in

James Broughton, who plays Dan

Broughton Good
He is doing a remarkable piece
; of woi'k in "The Critic," building a
| character with subtle pantomime as
well as through his intelligent read
j ing of the lines. He has a lightness
J of approach which is remarkable in
| view of his comparatively slight ex
perience and promises to stand high
j in the audience's favor.

tarily in "An Enemy of the People,"
