# 'CRITIC' SLATED FOR PALO ALTO
## 
### James Sandoe 
I Twelve times a year the Palo
j Alto Community Players present
I programs for members of the or
| ganization to which outsiders are
admitted for a small fee. These
programs are usually composed of
one-act plays, frequently the work
of various of the players them
selves.
Tomorrow night, for the first
time, the Players will present a
full-length play on a "membership
I program." It is Sheridan's satiric
farce, "The Critic."
Heavy Production
An unusually heavy production
which includes some two dozen
players and technical assistants, it
will be not only the most elaborate
but the most difficult thus far pre
sented.
Usually confined to plain curtains,
this particular membership produc
tion breaks another custom, There
will be two settings, one a room in
! Mr. Dangle's house, the other a set
! upon the stage of Covent Garden
; Theatre. The latter, a representa
! tion of Tilbury Fort on the English
{ coast, abounds in violent color and
| has a background of impressive
! granite which occupies the last at
i tentions of the tragic Tilburina and
| her faithful if unindegnious confi
i d&nt.

Stanfordites Vida Volkhardt and
j Walter Newcomb are handling the
l play's lighting and properties re-
I spectively. Newcomb was long the
! chief property man for Dramatic
Council productions and has been
known to locate the most curious
and impossible objects upon short
notice.
"The Critic" will begin promptly
| at 8:15 o'clock, and should be over
within two hours. Members of the
j Players' organization will be ad
j mitted upon presentation of mem-
I bership cards; non-members will
j be charged 25 cents. The seats are
| unreserved.
