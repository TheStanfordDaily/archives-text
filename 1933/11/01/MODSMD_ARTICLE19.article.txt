pies, will close at 5 o'clock this |

The Rally Committee suggests all j
women to wear gingham dresses to
the dance, and suggests that men
come as rurally as they wish.
The Rally Committee idea of j
'boasting the dance with a lost and!
j found gag about Hickley's pig has
. been dropped. Quickly adopted by
the Committee, it was with equal
j speed discarded.
