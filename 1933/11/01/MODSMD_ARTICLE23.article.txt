# Union Women Like Spinach Stanford '800' Can Take It—--Miss Ricker Robleites Must Have Milk

Spinach? Babies may not cry for
it, but Stanford women can take it
I—in large quantities—and like it!
'This traditionally dreaded vegetable
is a popular favorite with feminine
diners of the new Union unit, ac
i cording to Miss Christine Ricker,
• director of campus dining halls.
"Observing a single table the
other night, I noticed that every
girl at it. took a second helping of
spinach," said she proudly, scoring
a decisive vitamin victory.
Scientific Attitude
Whether or not this love for spin
ach is due to more scientific up
bringing by modern parents, or to
a desire on the part of the coeds to
avoid Mae West proportions, Miss
Ricker could not say.
The Union unit may like its spin
ach, but Roble intends to keep
young and healthy by drinking milk,

An excellent reason for increased
contentment among cows nowadays,
to say nothing of dairymen, is that
twice as much milk is being con
sumed by freshmen than was
downed last year.
"Despite the addition of 50 women
to Roble, this is a really great in
crease," said Miss Ricker.
Myn Eat More
The menu-planning dining hall
director, who spends most of her
day figuring out; what goes into the
stomachs of Stanford students, be
lieves that men eat more, but are
far less particular about their food
than women.
"We try to serve the women's
halls a variety of food, so the girls
can take their choice if something
on the menu doesn't appeal to them.
The men, however, will eat almost
anything, although they like to have
plenty of it.' 1
