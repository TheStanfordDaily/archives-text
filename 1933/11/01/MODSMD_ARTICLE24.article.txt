# GRAYS PROVIDE SECOND STRING NICE WORK-OUT
## Goofs Furnish Surprising Strength and Allow But Few Scores 
### Oliver Johnston, Jr 
While the big red first string ran j
signals on the goof field, the little i
goofs moved over on to the varsity j
turf and took the second string well j
in hand.
According to scale the second i
stringers should have run up a con- !
siderable score, but it was all they
could do to penetrate the goof line
for two or three touchdowns. It i
may be that the goofs were inspired |
by the band playing and general i
rally which was held to pep up the |
Indians in their first workout after i
defeat.
Poor Interference
The interference was not func
tioning at all and Ed Strong, Homer
Ransome, Ray Lewis and others
smeared most of the plays before
they got out of the backfield. On j
offense Lewis gained as much as j
any one of the second string backs. I
The long waited for moment fi- j
j nally came when Bones Hamilton j
I got into a scrimmage. He was j
greatly burdened by his Hallowe'en i
pumpkin helmet, but in spite of U<is I
fact did some good kicking and j
blocking. He made several goof
linemen wish that they were on the
bench. Hamilton did not have much
chance to show his running ability,
i being handicapped not only by his J
j helmet but also by the poor inter- ;
| ference.
Mullcr, Brandin Good
Wes Muller and Alf Brandin both
did well at center in spite of the j
fact that the ball was almost as wet
jas it was in the Seattle game. Shel !
| Bronstein looked well in the second j
{ string backfield until he was forced I
j out with a bad ankle. Bronstein is
as fast as any of them and lacks
only experience.
There is no kick coming on the
defensive playing of the Stanford
line. The goofs were pushed back
ion most of their thrusts, but on of
fense the linemen charge out and
run past the defense without even
a passing word of recognition.
The Gold Dust Twins, Rouble and
Adams, are fast improving. These
two always play beside each other,
and each knows what to expect from
the other.
Olympic Threats
Saturday when the Indians run
up against the Olympic Club they
are likely to find themselves having
a worse time than ever getting their
scoring power started with Jay Todd
\ and Bill Doub, former Stanford ends,
j doing their darndest to humiliate
their alma mater.
The only casualties in last night's
I fracas were a leg injury to Bob
j Steiner, and a bad knock on the
| head to Carlson.

greatly burdened by his Hallowe'en i
pumpkin helmet, but in spite of U<is I
fact did some good kicking and j
blocking. He made several goof
linemen wish that they were on the
bench. Hamilton did not have much
chance to show his running ability,
i being handicapped not only by his J
j helmet but also by the poor inter- ;
| ference.
Mullcr, Brandin Good
Wes Muller and Alf Brandin both
did well at center in spite of the j
fact that the ball was almost as wet
jas it was in the Seattle game. Shel !
| Bronstein looked well in the second j
{ string backfield until he was forced I
j out with a bad ankle. Bronstein is
as fast as any of them and lacks
only experience.
There is no kick coming on the
defensive playing of the Stanford
line. The goofs were pushed back
ion most of their thrusts, but on of
fense the linemen charge out and
run past the defense without even
a passing word of recognition.
The Gold Dust Twins, Rouble and
Adams, are fast improving. These
two always play beside each other,
and each knows what to expect from
the other.
Olympic Threats
Saturday when the Indians run
up against the Olympic Club they
are likely to find themselves having
a worse time than ever getting their
scoring power started with Jay Todd
\ and Bill Doub, former Stanford ends,
j doing their darndest to humiliate
their alma mater.
The only casualties in last night's
I fracas were a leg injury to Bob
j Steiner, and a bad knock on the
| head to Carlson.
While the big red first string ran j
signals on the goof field, the little i
goofs moved over on to the varsity j
turf and took the second string well j
in hand.
According to scale the second i
stringers should have run up a con- !
siderable score, but it was all they
could do to penetrate the goof line
for two or three touchdowns. It i
may be that the goofs were inspired |
by the band playing and general i
rally which was held to pep up the |
Indians in their first workout after i
defeat.
Poor Interference
The interference was not func
tioning at all and Ed Strong, Homer
Ransome, Ray Lewis and others
smeared most of the plays before
they got out of the backfield. On j
offense Lewis gained as much as j
any one of the second string backs. I
The long waited for moment fi- j
j nally came when Bones Hamilton j
I got into a scrimmage. He was j
greatly burdened by his Hallowe'en i
pumpkin helmet, but in spite of U<is I
fact did some good kicking and j
blocking. He made several goof
linemen wish that they were on the
