# Roughs Dispelled By New Women In Odd Jolly-Up
## 
### 
Stanford's Amazons !500 strong
completely routed the highly
touted roughs last night in the
Pavilion when they turned the
tables on their male compan
ions and chased them, cringing,
into the corners.
Despite the mad exhortations
of AI Pcache, yell king, who
urged the timorous males to
assert themselves, (he an
nouncement of a woman's tag
dance sent them scurrying into
the bleachers.
One brave rough deserves
mention for his determination.,
Peache lined up the roughs on
one side of the dance floor, gave
instructions to charge, blew his
whistle. Result: 200 roughs re
mained motionless, one rough
walked calmly across the floor
amid cheers and jeers to claim
the girl of his choice.
