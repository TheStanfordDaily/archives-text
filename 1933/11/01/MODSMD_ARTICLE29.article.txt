# New Type Play Unusual Here
## Three Complete Sets Used In Shaw Production 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
When Harold Helvenston's Friday
production of "Arms and the Man"
takes the boards, the local audi
ence will be treated to one of the
most colorful Stanford plays in a
number of years. Past plays have
been drawing room comedies, cos
tume dramas, historical tragedies,
and other such works which did not
give full play to the imaginative eye
of the techncial director.
Sets Depict Bulgaria
On several occasions in the past,
Helvenston has deftly paused in his
directing and designed the sets for
his plays, most recently in '"Hawk
Island," and before that in "Romeo
and Juliet," but the Shaw play pro
vides opportunity for the construc
tion of three complete and differing
sets. Into these three sets Helven
ston has infused all the magic snd
color of Bulgaria, in which the ac
tion is laid.
The first act represents the bed
room of Raina, daughter of the Pet
koffs, an up-and-coming Bulgarian
family. Here the action gets under
way, with the entrance into the
boudoir of Bluntschli, the fugitive
soldier.
Good Second-Act Set
Most elaborate of the three sets
is that of the second act, which
represents the garden of the Pet
koff residence, the first exterior to
appear on the local stage in some
time. It is here that much amusing
action takes place, with the soldiei's
back from the wars.
Act Three is laid in what the
aspiring Petkoffs fondly call their
library, and, as Raina says, "We arc
the only ones in Bulgaria who have
a library." This, says she, makes
them "civilized people."
In addition to the three gaily
colored sets, the observant mem
bers of the audience may discern
the Assembly Hall's newest acqui
sition — for which the stage crew
has been agitating for years—a new
cyclorama (skydrop, to you).
