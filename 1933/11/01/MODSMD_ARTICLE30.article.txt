# VILLIERS TALK THRILLS MANY
## 
### 
| Charming the audience with his ,
i modest, whimsical manner of re- i
j lating his thrilling voyage around ;
| Cape Horn, Alan J. Villiers ad- !
| dressed a packed Assembly Hall
j last night.
Accompanying his talk with mov
] ing pictures of innate beauty and :
j strength, Villiers affected a studied j
callousness to sentiment and ro-
I mancc about a trip which only an 1
I out-and-out romanticist would have
j taken. "Very beautiful, these ships," ;
! said he, "from a distance. The far
i ther you get away, the more beau- I
j tiful. They look nice in pictures."
Quiet Manner
Speaking in a quiet voice, with
an English inflection, Villiers talked
as the first reel flickered into dark
! ncss. The lights were turned on, 1
then off, as he reprovingly said, \
"Aw, don't turn, them on!"
"Once in a while we have a do- j
cent meal on board," he said. "It ;
takes a ten-year veteran to eat salt j
horse. But you get so you like pea
soup after a while."
Varied Experiences
Pictures of men making fast, the |
billowing sails were shown. "This ;
is dangerous," he remarked. Some- J
times your fingernails get torn out â€¢
by the roots." But they grow on |
again, according to Villiers, who
| should know.
Running the gamut of marine ex
perience, everything from the cere
! mony at crossing the bar, to the
< burial at sea of a fellow shipmate !
j was described.
