## Charlie Karl Will Lead New Election Board for 1933-34 OTHER APPOINTMENTS Hables Suggests Student Labor on Dances 
### 
With tuxedoed, stiff necked Jerry
Trautman, straight from Deke ini
tiation ceremonies, al the helm,
A.S.S.U.'s Executive Committee las!,
night romped through usual busi
ness, made appointments to the Con
stitutional Revision Committee.
To the revisionist list were named
AI Denney, chairman; Walter Bogart,
Crompton Bangs, and President
Trautman and Jeanne Millard ex
officio members.
Karl Named Board Head
On suggestion of President Traut
man obliging committee member.;
okehed into office Charlie Karl as
chairman of the election board. Fact
that onetime Student Manager Karl
has had no experience on election
boards makes no difference, is a
good thing perhaps, said high-col
lared Trautman.
Injecting yell leader troubles into
the session, swimmer, cheerer Jim
my Triolo presented Royal Ivory
who in turn presented a compli
cated case concerning the eligibility
of junior transfers to tryout. for as
sistant yell leader positions. Hand
book says only sophomores are eli
gible. Ivory asked indulgence be
cause he intends to spend, study
three years at Stanford.
To O.K. transfer tryoutees mean
that "native" juniors be afforded the
same opportunity, said Editor Mol
linkoff. Not necessarily, said singer
George McKee.
Triolo to Investigate
Result of much rangling, bicker
ing, hair splitting: President Traut
man named Jimmy Triolo as chair
man of a committee of three to
thrash matter out, present report
next week.
Answering a letter from President
Fay Lyman Wilbur, President
Trautman set out to name three stu
dents to the Social Service Board.
Before the naming, A.W.S. head
Jeanne Millard had a question. Be
fore the answering President Traut
man had to ask executive Millard
to step from behind his chair that
he, stiff-necked leader, might see
questioner. Result: Frank Fullen
wider, Harry Hoagland, Mort Fuller.
To close the session, smooth, soft
spoken Student Manager Les Hables
presented a .system that will, if suc
cessful, make it possible to keep
dance decoration, stage decoration,
prices from joining the sky-high
NPA level. Hable's plan calls for
student designers and technicians
working through his office to be at
the beck and call of frustrated
money short decoration chiefs.
