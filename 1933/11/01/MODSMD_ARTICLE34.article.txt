# A 						New Deal
## 
### 
A liackncved phrase before Roosevelt took it up, and
more of a hackneyed phrase since that time, is a "New
Deal." Yet just that thing is about to happen on this Cam
pus. The A.S.S.T. Constitution is to he rewritten —revision
is the technical word.
Hut it should be more of a rearrangement. Though
goodness knows that is necessary enough. It is now just
about impossible to quote a section of the document with
out stuttering and embarrassment. And as far as under
standing a section once it is quoted, the harried Dean of
the Law School is the only person so gifted.
Hut we students should not stop at this point. It is
youth that is said to be liberal, the hope of the world, the
vanguard of progress. We should not be afraid to change
or experiment. We should not attempt to copy the product
of our elders, as it is usually the result of self-interest and
historical accident and not conscious effort.
The revision of the Constitution is an opportunity to
Ibis college generation. It should be a grand experience.
An excellent committee, non-political in its makeup, has
been appointed. It is expected that they will take the situ
ation and turn it to good advantage.
Hut it is more than a committee matter. It is a matter
for the whole student body. It is up to every person with
an idea to communicate it to the Committee. But even that
is not enough. For few of us have any ideas on the ques
tion. It behooves each student to read the Constitution,
revel for a few hours in its startling ambiguities and an
tiquities, and then make suggestions to the Committee.
The Daily will print the open meetings of the Committee;
interested students should attend.
