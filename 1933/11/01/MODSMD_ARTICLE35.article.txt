# Liberalism?
## 
### 
Fretting because townspeople complained that some of
(he Cal students are radicals, The Daily C.alifornian has
tened to explain editorially that the alleged radicals
(whoso radicalism consisted in saying that farm workers
should bo paid enough to live on) were looked upon with
disfavor by most of the students, and that the campus
liberals are simply troublesome and unrecognized black
sheep.
It is perhaps none of our business if The Daily C.ali
fornian chooses to support conservatism in a day of liber
alism, but we fool it is worthy of comment when opinion
in one of the largest universities in the world refers to
liberal students as "unrepresentative" and "black sheep."
There would bo little progress without a group of radi
cals to speed up die-hard conservatives'and reactionaries.
Washington and Lincoln were more radical than any pres
onl-dav student has the brains to be; half the good writers
are radical, and nine-tenths fo the good professors. If the
I .('. editors want to pick on liberals, they can find a long
lis! of them in Who's Who.
At Stanford wo are willing to withstand an occasional
whiff of hot air, in order to have the privilege of lotting the
Wind of Freedom blow.
