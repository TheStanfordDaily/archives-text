# Obstructionists or Patriots
## 
### 
The Republicans have launched their attack on Presi
dent Roosevelt. Up until now, a stray Republican has ven
tured forth every now and then to speak his mind; only to
lie drowned out by the blare of the drums in an X.R.A.
parade. Rut the present attack is official in that it is found
in a pamphlet of the Republican Congressional Committee.
The Republicans are out in earnest.
Many self-admitted patriots will view with alarm,
alarm not unmixed with horror at this procedure. Rut
many people are apt to view most things with alarm and
with horror. The attacking C.0.P.-ers will be branded as
obstructionists. They will be looked upon as monkey
wrenches in the Recovery Administration machinery. Less
polite people will view them as plain chattering monkeys
in the prosperity grove that promising shade on the rosy
horizon.
Rut these Republicans are not monkeys nor even mon
key-wrenches. In a democratic form of government, the
right to criticize is not only a right bill it is a benefit. Roo
sevelt may be right or he may be wrong, but for the safety
of everyone except wheelhorsc Democrats, it is splendid
to have the Republicans criticize.
The danger of the Republicans during the era of swell
times was that they would become too powerful, that all
opposition would have been ended by the simple process
</l absorption. The same annoyance threatened after the
Roosevelt landslide or calamity depending 011 one's point
of view.
Rut the Republicans have finally picked themselves
oil' of the national canvas, and though still a bit shaky at
the knees, are attempting to offer a little opposition to the
Rourhon bambino. Their criticism will make the Roose
vellians always slick to firm ground.
Of course, no one need deduce that the Republicans arc
acting in such a manner out of ;i great patriotic urge within
them. They are criticizing for the same reason the Demo
crats did to work their way back to the public trough.
