# BULL SESSION
## TROUNCE TROY WITH GRAPENUTS! 
### 
All Stanford awaits the Hay of the
millennium: when the Big Red Ma
chine shall batter down the hereto
fore impregnable walls of Troy. "Go
South," loudly shouts the Rally
Committee, "the team needs your
support." And not less loudly bel
low the transportation companies:
"Go South! support your team!"
The bus and railroad lines are
infused with the spirit of Stanford
victory. They are pulling for the
Farm, despite the fact that just last
week they were pulling hard for
S.C. The commercial caravals are
enthusiastic over the prospect of a
Trojan-Indian clash; but they are
enthusiastic over spondulics, not
Stanford. Thornhill is thinking of
manpower; Esspce is thinking of
mileage.
To assure the team of greater sup
port in the Southland, A.S.S.U. has
offered its offices as the campus
embassy of these commercial enter
prises. For the companies, of course,
this is good business. It immedia
tely lifts financial gain from the
gutter of greedy acquisitiveness to
the lofty plain of university loyalty.
Business is undoubtedly justified.
It must take what it can get.
But what of Stanford management
that has so freely turned the stu
dent body office into a reservation
depot for business babbitry? The
roads are undoubtedly glad to print

' free football publicity, even satis
fied to share their earnings with
the A.S.S.U. But where can such
a merry chase end? Is the Univer
sity an educational institution or a
school of dollar diplomacy? The an
swer, "Both" is shallow rhetoric.
If it is decided to turn the Farm
over to the barons of big business,
our financial problems are readily
solved. Kellogg, the corn-fiake king
from Batile Creek, would be only
too glad to pay the cost of blue
books, if on the top of each tiny
pamphlet were printed (even in
small letters): "Crack that ex with
All-Bran." General Food Corpora
tion would rush in to meet the chal
lenge; grape-nut subsidies would be
the order of the day.
Into all branches of the Univer
sity, business would gladly extend
its grimy paws. All things come to
the University that is ready to com
j promise itself to lusty lucre. A new
assembly hall would be a certainly;
even though there glittered across
the proscenium: "Let's Get Asso
ciated."
It is only a question of choice.
Some would rather squirm in the
draft-ridden Stanford Assembly Hall
than open the sandstone gates to big
business. But dollars are tempting;
they have always been. The A.S.
S.U. has said: "Resist not Tempta
tion.' —Dave MellinkofT

the order of the day.
Into all branches of the Univer
sity, business would gladly extend
its grimy paws. All things come to
the University that is ready to com
j promise itself to lusty lucre. A new
assembly hall would be a certainly;
even though there glittered across
the proscenium: "Let's Get Asso

It is only a question of choice.
Some would rather squirm in the
draft-ridden Stanford Assembly Hall
than open the sandstone gates to big
business. But dollars are tempting;
they have always been. The A.S.
S.U. has said: "Resist not Tempta

All Stanford awaits the Hay of the
millennium: when the Big Red Ma
chine shall batter down the hereto
fore impregnable walls of Troy. "Go
South," loudly shouts the Rally
Committee, "the team needs your
support." And not less loudly bel
low the transportation companies:
"Go South! support your team!"
The bus and railroad lines are
infused with the spirit of Stanford
victory. They are pulling for the
Farm, despite the fact that just last
week they were pulling hard for
S.C. The commercial caravals are
enthusiastic over the prospect of a
Trojan-Indian clash; but they are
enthusiastic over spondulics, not
Stanford. Thornhill is thinking of
manpower; Esspce is thinking of
mileage.
To assure the team of greater sup
port in the Southland, A.S.S.U. has
offered its offices as the campus
embassy of these commercial enter
prises. For the companies, of course,
this is good business. It immedia
tely lifts financial gain from the
gutter of greedy acquisitiveness to
the lofty plain of university loyalty.
Business is undoubtedly justified.
It must take what it can get.
But what of Stanford management
that has so freely turned the stu
dent body office into a reservation
depot for business babbitry? The
roads are undoubtedly glad to print

' free football publicity, even satis
fied to share their earnings with
the A.S.S.U. But where can such
a merry chase end? Is the Univer
sity an educational institution or a
school of dollar diplomacy? The an
swer, "Both" is shallow rhetoric.
If it is decided to turn the Farm
over to the barons of big business,
our financial problems are readily
solved. Kellogg, the corn-fiake king
from Batile Creek, would be only
too glad to pay the cost of blue
books, if on the top of each tiny
pamphlet were printed (even in
small letters): "Crack that ex with
All-Bran." General Food Corpora
