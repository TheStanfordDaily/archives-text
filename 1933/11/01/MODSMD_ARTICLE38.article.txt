## INQUISITIVE GRADUATES 
### 
The Editor:
I don't know how reliable the
Daily's report was on the selection
ol' the Radio Debaters, but assum
ing that some of the material state
ments were true I am bothered by
these questions:
1. If, to assure impartiality, all the
contestants were numbered and
known only by number, how did the
judges know that Nos. 5 and 10
were graduates?
2. If the purpose of the tryouts
was to pick the best available ma
terial, why discriminate against
graduates?
Would this have been the first
time graduate students have de
buted for Stanford?
3. If there are any rules and reg
ulations prohibiting the use of
graduates, how is it the coaches and
judges knew nothing of them until
after the tryouts?
4. Was it fair to demand and en
courage the expenditure of much

] valuable time and preparation of al
ready busy graduates, only to de
j cide against them after they qualify?
i Incidently, Mr. Editor, you know
I how busy law grads are—and a large
percentage of the grad tryoutees
were in that class.
5. Finally, what did Coach Lee
! Chfipin mean when he assured No. 5,
! and perhaps others, that there would
! be absolute no discrimination?
j Please don't misunderstand, I am
not griping because 1 was one of
those discriminated against. I had
I the good fortune to foresee such
arbitrary action and avoid falling
for the bait and hooey.

Mitchell Saadi.
