# More Gold
## 
### 
Gold prices continued to soar, rose
1(J cents to $32.12 an ounce. Miners
and impoverished mine stockhold
ers were jubilant at the new figure,
nimost a full dollar above the world
price. While English newspapers
were dubious, almost skeptical of
F.R.'s eiTorts, the two countries
moved closer to consultation on gold
policy. Across the channel, watch
ful France, probable goat of such a
maneuver, came out officially for
an absolute maintenance of the gold
standard.
Contrariwise, stocks sagged badly
on U.S. marts. Probable cause: un
certainty and nervousness over the
President's program to raise prices
by upping gold. Almost certain
sequel if this fails: Inflation, pure
and simple.
