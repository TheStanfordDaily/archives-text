# Insull Safe Again
## 
### 
Once again the long arm of U.S.
law tried to snatch exiled utility
man Insull from his pleasant abode
.in Greece; once again it failed.
| Muchly wanted in Chicago for va
rious degrees of financial larceny,
j the ex-tycoon praised the Greek
| court which refused U.S. extradi
tion. Said he: "These Greek judges
are ideal. I hope that by some fi
-1 nancial combinations, I may be able
to reciprocate." Sadder, but wiser
investors wondered if more water
filled utility pyramids are to be
j built on friendly Grecian soil.
