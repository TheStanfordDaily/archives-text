						NOTE IN PROTEST 
### 
Every now and then Tin Pan Al- '
ley, in their ov/n small way, go j
highbrow (for them), and we find
that one of their efforts bears a lit
erary imprint. It may be only that
the title is taken from a current
novel or play, but that more than ,
appeases the intelligensia of the
Alley.
The first manifestation of this |
great intellectual urge was in Allie
Wrubel's appropriation of the Pi
randello title, "As You Desire Me." j
The success of the song was helped
by the Greta Garbo film of that
name, and by the fact that, after its
initial singing by the well-beloved
Rudy Vallee, the words were some- |
what altered for broadcasting pur- j
poses.
Then, without knowing just what ;
a strange interlude implied, the title |
of the O'Neill play (currently star- j
ring Norma Shearer and Clark Ga- ,
ble) was pinned onto a popular ditty
of the day.
Good old Samuel Pepys would
probably turn a somersault in his
grave if he realized that someone
had penned a tune entitled "And So
to Bed" — also censored for radio j
purposes.
"Farewell to Arms" would never
have occurred to Tin Pan Alley had
it not been for the film by that
name, but it made good use of the ,
Ernest Hemingway title, leaving one
in little doubt as to whether it was

war-arms or women-arms under
discussion.
Perhaps the boldest adaptation of
the literary touch is found in the
recent "To Be or Not to Be in Love,"
which should open up great possi
bilities for the song writers.
But the alpha and omega of this
tiresome business is contained in
the "hit song" of a recent moom
pitcher entitled "My Weakness."
This little tune is a fine fireside
ditty designed purely for home use,
one which may readily be used as
a lullaby with which to rock unsus
pecting infants to sleep, one which
may be sung at Browning Club
meetings, one which will probably
replace "Drink to Me Only With
Thine Eyes" in the hearts of the
old folks. It bears the vomitory ap
pellation of "Gather Lip Rouge
While You May."
When Robert Kerrick, in the early
seventeenth century, said, "Gather
ys rosebuds while ye may," he pre
sumably meant that rosebuds, meta
phorically speaking, were desirable.
But I ask you, who in his right
mind would be concerned with the
nauseating process of gathering lip
rouge; moreover, who is to say
whether or not one may gather lip
rouge.
The second line of the song is
right in the spirit of it all: "Gather
lip rouge while you may —you'll
never be much younger." (See the

"I'm Young and Healthy" school of
thought.)
Then again, we must face the
facts: perhaps there are those who
gather lip rouge—but why blat
about it? —Chapin
