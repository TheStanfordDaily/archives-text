# FROSH POINT FOR LITTLE BIG GAME, RESUME PRACTICE
## Vigna Returns After Two Weeks' Lay-off, Beedle Sheds Crutches 
### 
Pointing for the ten days away
California game while preparing to
lake the San Jose State yearlings
in stride next Saturday, the Stan
ford frosh resumed practice last
night after a day's rain-necessitated
layoff.
Though defeated in their last
three starts, Coach Jimmic Brad
shaw's charges have hopes of more
than redeeming themselves by lip
setting the Bears next week, a
feat that no Card frosh team lias
performed for several years.
Since the S.C. babes defeated the
Cubs G-0 the week alter Stanford
had come v/ithin the proverbial
hair's breadth of beating the Tro
jans, it would seem that Bradshaw's
men are indulging in no idle day
dream when they lay plans to hum
ble their traditional rivals across the
Bay.
Laid up for two weeks with a knee
injury received in the S.C. game,
Joe Vigna, signal-calling left half,
was back at practice, brushing up
on new formations.
Captain Beedle Out
Off crutches, though not in uni
foim, Captain Dale Beedle was on
deck for a while to watch hi.s hard
working team-mates. Melvin Hur
ley, the third major freshman cas
ualty, was still limping, still not
practicing.
With Don Robesky, member of the
famous Post-Robesky guard combi
nation, cracking the whip, all the
frosh linemen went through a stren
uous session of charging practice.
Backs worked out under Coach
Erad.shaw and basketball mentor
John Bunn, who also lends a help
ing hand to frosh grid fortunates.
Breather Saturday
In what is no more than a pre-
Liitle Big Game breather, the In
dian frosh will meet the San Jose
State babes Saturday in a prelim
inary to the varsity game with the
Olympic Club. Entering upon their
second season of competition, the
recently-created State College frosh
team is not expected to offer much
resistance to Stanford.
