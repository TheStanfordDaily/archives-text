# INDIANS EXPECT SOCCER VICTORY
## San Jose Kickers Invade Campus Today at 3: 45 
### Joe Lanidrac 
A second victory over San Jose
State College's soccer varsity seems .
imminent when Stanford's squad j
takes the field this afternoon. Stan- |
ford won 4-1 in the first meeting.
The game is scheduled to begin at i
3:45 o'clock.
The possible absence of Cy John- 1
soft, able left fullback, may weaken
the defense, but Coach Harry Ma
loney's decision to insert Rod Lewis, :
veteran half and fullback, in John
son's place will re-fortify the re
pelling division. Dick Strouse, who
1 has been playing the light fullback
post regularly, will be on the green. I
Backed by star goalie Jack King, the
defense will be capable of handling
their adversaries in good style.
Five-man OfTensc
That five-man forward offense I
which rattled the San Jose goalnet !
four times in the last game will.be
.started again. With exhibitions such '
as they have given in recent practice J
scrimmages to give proof of any
statements of their prowess, it may
be calculated that they will outdo |
their previous recordâ€”if the wet |
field does not prove a handicap.
| Carl Knecht, captain; Art Hearn,
Miguel Gomez, Chuck Emerick, and '
Sven Boddington will probably com- j
prise the forward line line-up. I
Knecht and Hearn, both lighting ag
gressive soccermen, are the two 1
i sparkplugs of the scoring offense.
Halfbacks Strong
Halfback position is the strongest
point of the team, according to Ma- i
loncy. Johnnie Moore, Waddy White, :
and Rudy Gonzales will probably;
start in the midfield wall, playing j
both offensive and defensive. John- |
ny Hitchcock, Halph Cotter, Louis i
Eansbach, and Dave Dunning arc'
| the re-enforcements which assure j
strength to the halfbacks.
Doug Kennedy, temporarily in- j
1 tiipible first-string half, has been'
scrimmaging lately and is expected j
|to be ready for the University of i
I California contest series which starts j
1 in one week,
