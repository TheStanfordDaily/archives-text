# CARD POLOISTS HAVE EDGE ON DEL MONTE
## 
### 
j As the second game of the fall i
season, Captain Gordan's Stanford'
poloists will meet Del Monte on the '
| campus next Friday. Though little I
i.s known about the visiting quar- j
let, the only basis of comparison j
; available gives the Indians a con-*]
siderable edge.
Last Sunday the Del Monte four
bowed to Menlo Circus Club 5 to 2. j
The previous Friday, Stanford de
feated Menlo 7 to 1. Whether or 1
not the Circus Club used the same '
line-up on both occasions is- not |
known, however.
Stanford's starting line-up for,
Friday's game will probably be the i
same one that saw action against !
Menlo last week. It includes Luppe i
Luppen at number one, Frank Burns
at two, Woody Melone at three, and
Bill Rogers at back.
