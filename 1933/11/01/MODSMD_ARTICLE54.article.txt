Frankie and Johnny were halfbacks,
O, how those two babies could go.
Frankie carried the old apple
While Johnny blocked 'em hard and low.
Johnny was a blockin' back
And always got his man.
Now they went down to play S.C.
And when the tackle had to go out,
Johnny smacked him on the kisser
And it was a 70 to 0 rout.
This guy Johnny was good;
ISo could got liis man.
Michigan never stopped this pair,
For when that end came booming around,
Johnny pecked him on the bulton,
And put him down flat on the ground.
They didn't stop Frankie,
Johnny was gettin' his man.
Now Johnny looked in the papers
And he saw there spread wide and high
A picture of Frankie, and the caption
"He Is a Marvelous Guy."
This didn't please Johnny,
lie was gettin' the man.
"Now coach," said Johnny, "What (ho hell
Does Frankie think he's about?
Don't he know that if it wasn't for me,
They'd be sayin' 'This Guy Is a Loul?'
"I'm gettin' his man
And he's doing me wrong."
But then they went to play Siwash,
The quarter called for a center buck.
They picked up poor Johnny in pieces,
Because he had forgotten to duck.
Johnny missed his man.
And they done him wrong.
"O, l'oll me over easy,
O, roll me over slow,
Roll me over on the right side
Because that fullback hurt me so."
Johnny's singin' the blues
'Cause they done him wrong.
So the coach took Frankie aside
Told him, "We gotta win the Big Game"
And you're gonna do all the blocking,
Because poor Johnny is awful lame.
"Now I know you're good,
And can get your man."
Frankie didn't like to block,
Because he had to dive deep in the mud
And bounce off the tackle all day
'Tiil he fell with a "sickening thud."
But Frankie was good,
lie got his man.
When Frankie blocked, they carried out Kurth,
And Bill Smith went out on a stretcher.
Palmer and Manske had three busted ribs,
Was Frankie good—you damn betcher!
He was pa-lenty good,
He could get his man.
When Johnny returned to the fray
He found Frankie had a cinch on his job.
Said the coach, "You carry the ball,"
You're gonna be just one of the mob.
"Because Frankie is good,
He gets his man."
Now Frankie and Johnny arc halfbacks
And O, how those babies can go.
With Johnny carrying the apple,
And Frankie blockin' hard and low.
' Johnny's a blockin' back
That always gets his man.
When Frankie looks in the paper
He sees Johnny spread all over the sheet,
And the caption says that "This Mug
As a Halfback Is Mighty Sweet."
Frankie don't give a damn,
He knows who's gettin' the man.
