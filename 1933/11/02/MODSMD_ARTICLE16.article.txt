### CHARLOTTE BURRIDGE 
that is the question in the minds
of the student leaders Justine Jan
kowsky and Bill Morse, directors of
dormitory groups, and students at
large.
Whether it would be better to
leave the traditional Stanford "mix
ers" without supervision as in past
years, or to again try to provide a
good time for all by compulsory
dancing as attempted at Tuesday
evening's affair, is being discussed
at length by those in charge of so
cial activities of the new men and
women.
The Tuesday jolly-up, featuring
(he inauguration of women's tag
dances on the campus, has excited
much favorable and unfavorable
comment. Student comments fol

Junior Transfer Holene Boorse:
"The men don't seem to realize that
the day of their idolized supremacy
is over. The women go to the jolly
ups to look over just as much as to
be looked over. The women did their
part Tuesday night to make the get
ting acquainted a success but some
of the men didn't, seem to get into
the spirit of the affair at all."
Union Club President Mary Anita
Loos: "I think the day of the jolly
up is over because at the present
liuie there are more eligible women

than men on the campus. So what?"
Debater Bob Grantier: "The
beauty of a jolly-up is to get ac
quainted with a number of people.
They are obviously not for the pur
pose of dancing. Last Tuesday
night's event didn't even have that
virtue because there was so little
cutting."
Junior Transfer . Marion Selig:
"Jolly-ups provide a good opportu
nity to further acquaintances made
in classrooms and on the Quad. If
the girls were left standing it was
their own fault. Women's tag dances
give the girls a chance to dance
with someone of their own choice
without the risk of getting 'stuck'
with an undesirable partner. Un
fortunately, too, it seems to provide
a favorable place for the bashful
freshmen to practice their dancing."
Assistant Secretary of the Union
Club Florence Weddell: "When it
comes to tagging boys for dances—
that's the limit. This is a coed in
stitution. What about a little more
cc-operation from the men?"
Bob Harvey: "Theoretically the
iriea of women cutting is fine but
practically it just doesn't, work be
cause the women are too chicken
to tag the men."
What about the masculine chick
ens? ask many.

cause the women are too chicken
to tag the men."
What about the masculine chick
ens? ask many.
that is the question in the minds
of the student leaders Justine Jan
kowsky and Bill Morse, directors of
dormitory groups, and students at
large.
Whether it would be better to
leave the traditional Stanford "mix
ers" without supervision as in past
years, or to again try to provide a
good time for all by compulsory
dancing as attempted at Tuesday
evening's affair, is being discussed
at length by those in charge of so
cial activities of the new men and
women.
The Tuesday jolly-up, featuring
(he inauguration of women's tag
dances on the campus, has excited
much favorable and unfavorable
comment. Student comments fol
low:
Junior Transfer Holene Boorse:
"The men don't seem to realize that
the day of their idolized supremacy
is over. The women go to the jolly
ups to look over just as much as to
be looked over. The women did their
part Tuesday night to make the get
ting acquainted a success but some
of the men didn't, seem to get into
the spirit of the affair at all."
Union Club President Mary Anita
Loos: "I think the day of the jolly
up is over because at the present
liuie there are more eligible women

than men on the campus. So what?"
Debater Bob Grantier: "The
beauty of a jolly-up is to get ac
quainted with a number of people.
They are obviously not for the pur
pose of dancing. Last Tuesday
night's event didn't even have that
virtue because there was so little
cutting."
Junior Transfer . Marion Selig:
"Jolly-ups provide a good opportu
nity to further acquaintances made
in classrooms and on the Quad. If
the girls were left standing it was
their own fault. Women's tag dances
give the girls a chance to dance
with someone of their own choice
without the risk of getting 'stuck'
with an undesirable partner. Un
fortunately, too, it seems to provide
a favorable place for the bashful
freshmen to practice their dancing."
Assistant Secretary of the Union
Club Florence Weddell: "When it
comes to tagging boys for dances—
that's the limit. This is a coed in
stitution. What about a little more
cc-operation from the men?"
Bob Harvey: "Theoretically the
iriea of women cutting is fine but
practically it just doesn't, work be
cause the women are too chicken
to tag the men."
