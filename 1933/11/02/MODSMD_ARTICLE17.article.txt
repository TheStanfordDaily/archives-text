# U.C. Women to Debate Cards
## Stanford to Support Merit Of Free Speech 
### 
Difficult opponents will be met
by two confident University of Cali
fornia women when they defy two
j Stanford men to uphold the merits
! of free speech in the Little Theatre
at 7:30 o'clock tonight. The men
are Robert Grantier and John Ly
| man.
Almost certain to disconcert the
i challengers is the explosive asser
(tive manner of Grantier, nicknamed
by several cohorts, ''Bull Montana."
j Backing his dynamite style of de
livery, Grantier has the experience
i of four freshman duels, and two de
j bates last year.
1 Lyman will make his debut this
evening. A member of Phi Beta
j Kappa and holder of the intercol
legiate shot-putting title, Lyman is
exprcted to present a brilliant ease.
Heckling will follow debating,
j Each team member will talk for 10
j minutes and at the end of the 40-
I minute period, questions from the
i floor will be in order. Each person
I may ask the debaters not more than
, i\vo questions, and each heckler can
1 expect the privileges of free speech
j in forming those interrogations.
Holding the gavel during the
question period and introducing the
speakers will be Associated Women
I Students' President Jeanne Millard.
