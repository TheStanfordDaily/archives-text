# MISCHA ELMAN GETS CONCERT SERIES OVATION
## Record Audience Enthused As Violinist Begins Year's Concerts 
### Annalee Whitmore 
Eyes closed, expression intent,
Mischa Elman last night justified all
predictions regarding his second
Stanford concert, exceptional power
and depth of feeling setting this
former child prodigy apart as a vio
linist of the first rank.
The largest crowd in recent years
hailed his "return to the Farm,"
thunderous applause greeting the
initial appearance of the artist. El
man opened his program with "So
nata in A major," by Handel, evinc
ing his fondness for classics by an
expression of ease, enjoyment, but
concentration.
Contrast Included
Powerful bowing featured Mo
zart's "Sonata in D flat major No.
15." each of the three movements
achieving unusual delicacy of inter
pretation. In direct contrast was
Glazanows "Concerto in A Minor,"
Russian, exotic, and not frequently
included in the repertoire of violin
ists. Elman, Russian himself, derives
special enjoyment from this distinc
tive composition.
Feet braced, brow glistening, El
man held the record crowd spell
bound. His remarkable memory was
evidenced, sheet music being re
quired for few renditions, somewhat
faulty eyesight necessitating the
donning of gold-rimmed glasses for
this surveyal.
Schlusscl Accompanist
Sanford Sehlussel, accompanying
on the Steinway Grand, has been
with Elman for the short space of
one year.
> Last night's appearance followed
concerts in Portland, Vancouver,
San Francisco, and Carmel, the last
immediately preceding his Stanford
performance. Elman headlined the
introductory period of concert se
rie ~ appearing in 1927 to a likewise
appreciative audience.
Manager Davis, stocky, genial,
ledhaired, busily protected the re
modeled locker room which served
as Elman's dressing room.
Campus Courtesy Noted
Student courtesy and enthusiasm
are outstanding characteristics of the
audience, declared Elman, smiling
with but a trace of accent. He de
livered the same program to the
campus aggregation at his concert
in San Francisco, considering cul
tural levels equal.
Local citizenry, musical but eco
nomical, turned out in the record
brcaking total of 1,(>00, largest in
recent years. Estimated by Prentice
Messimer, concert monager, at $5,-
GOO, gate receipts were announced
more than gratifying. Fully half
present were students, Palo Altans
also numerous.
Elman, not the traditional artist
in temperament, declared no aver
sion to autographing. It depends,
says he, upon reaction of the audi
ence and his own stage of fatigue.
Gives Violinists Advice
"One cannot judge the apprecia
tion of student audiences, so enthu
siastic are they," he remarked, mild
and gratified. Advice to enterpris
ing violinists consists merely of a
warning to expect nothing; fame and
fortune are the exception rather
than the rule, states he.
His own "Tango," listed as first
encore, classes him with the first
rank of composers as well as artists,
unusual in his field.
The converted pavilion he con
siders acoustically perfect, unpre
possessing in appearance.

Russian, exotic, and not frequently
included in the repertoire of violin
ists. Elman, Russian himself, derives
special enjoyment from this distinc
tive composition.
Feet braced, brow glistening, El
man held the record crowd spell
bound. His remarkable memory was
evidenced, sheet music being re
quired for few renditions, somewhat
faulty eyesight necessitating the
donning of gold-rimmed glasses for
this surveyal.
Schlusscl Accompanist
Sanford Sehlussel, accompanying
on the Steinway Grand, has been
with Elman for the short space of
one year.
> Last night's appearance followed
concerts in Portland, Vancouver,
San Francisco, and Carmel, the last
immediately preceding his Stanford
performance. Elman headlined the
introductory period of concert se
rie ~ appearing in 1927 to a likewise
appreciative audience.
Manager Davis, stocky, genial,
ledhaired, busily protected the re
modeled locker room which served
as Elman's dressing room.
Campus Courtesy Noted
Student courtesy and enthusiasm
are outstanding characteristics of the
audience, declared Elman, smiling
with but a trace of accent. He de
livered the same program to the
campus aggregation at his concert
in San Francisco, considering cul
tural levels equal.
Local citizenry, musical but eco
nomical, turned out in the record
brcaking total of 1,(>00, largest in
recent years. Estimated by Prentice
Messimer, concert monager, at $5,-
GOO, gate receipts were announced
more than gratifying. Fully half
present were students, Palo Altans
also numerous.
Elman, not the traditional artist
in temperament, declared no aver
sion to autographing. It depends,
says he, upon reaction of the audi
ence and his own stage of fatigue.
Gives Violinists Advice
"One cannot judge the apprecia
tion of student audiences, so enthu
siastic are they," he remarked, mild
and gratified. Advice to enterpris
ing violinists consists merely of a
warning to expect nothing; fame and
fortune are the exception rather
than the rule, states he.
His own "Tango," listed as first
encore, classes him with the first
rank of composers as well as artists,
unusual in his field.
The converted pavilion he con
siders acoustically perfect, unpre
possessing in appearance.
Eyes closed, expression intent,
Mischa Elman last night justified all
predictions regarding his second
Stanford concert, exceptional power
and depth of feeling setting this
former child prodigy apart as a vio
linist of the first rank.
The largest crowd in recent years
hailed his "return to the Farm,"
thunderous applause greeting the
initial appearance of the artist. El
man opened his program with "So
nata in A major," by Handel, evinc
ing his fondness for classics by an
expression of ease, enjoyment, but
concentration.
Contrast Included
Powerful bowing featured Mo
zart's "Sonata in D flat major No.
15." each of the three movements
achieving unusual delicacy of inter
pretation. In direct contrast was
Glazanows "Concerto in A Minor,"
Russian, exotic, and not frequently
included in the repertoire of violin
ists. Elman, Russian himself, derives
special enjoyment from this distinc
tive composition.
