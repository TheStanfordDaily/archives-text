# LARGE CROWDS EXPECTED FOR SHAW'S SATIRE
## Loos, Peckham to Star In Helvenston Offering Tomorrow Night 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
A dramatic event, of the first mag- j
nitude will be proffered Stanford j
theatregoers tomorrow night, when
the initial dramatic offering of the
year is presented in the Assembly i
Hall. George Bernard Shaw's "Arms
and the Man" provide Harold Hel
venston's skilled cast with ample'
opportunity for entertaining the ca- i
pacity audience that is expected to ;
attend.
In rehearsal for nearly a month, !
the play is one of the most brilliant '
of the succession of plays, "pleasant j
and unpleasant" from the pen of '
the gifted and much-insulted Brit- ;
ish writer. It is a satirical treat- J
mc-nt of war, and is laid in the j
household of a Bulgarian family to ;
which comes a Serbian fugitive.
No Ordinary Fugitive
But no ordinary fugitive, this Cap
lain Bluntschli; he eats chocolate
creams, invades ladies boudoirs, in
the end carries off the heroine,
Raina. And the intervening action j
is what provides so much of the
attendant amusement.
Helvenston's cast is by j
Mary Anita Loos and John Peck- 1
ham, who played brother and sister j
in "Holiday" and now appear in a
slightly different relationship.
Paul Crary, the Hovstad of "An j
Enemy of the People," and the leer- j
ing villain of "Hawk Island," is here
provided with the best role of his
Stanford career, in the part of Pet- |
koff, the dull father of the family. |
His comedy should do much to en
liven the evening.
Salt as Comedian
Comedy is also the contribution
of Waldo Salt, who performed a (
like function in "Hawk Island," and
this time appears as Nikola, the Pet
koff man-of-all-work.
Jean Albertson, in her Assembly
Hall debut, mingles comedy and
drama in her interpretation of
Louka, the defiant servant of the i
household.
Beloved by both Raina and Louka
at various times, George Leavens i
has one of the most interesting roles
in the playâ€”that of Captain Sara
noff. Another newcomer, Virginia
Marvin, is expected to achieve a
distinct characterization in her Cath
erine, the distinguished and domi
neering mother of the family.
