### 
As the time draws near for the
men of '37 to view the abodes of the
Greeks for the first time, fraternity
leaders look for the most extensive
two-day rushing period in campus
history, announced Interfraternity
Chairman Don Tatum late yesterday.
At this time Talum reports that
more than 2,000 cards have been
mailed to freshmen, arranging for
dates over the period which include
luncheon and dinner on Friday and
Saturday. This is over one and a
hall times the number of cards that
have been sent out for any previous
rushing period.
Tatum offers prospective Greeks
several suggestions: mail cards
hack to the houses as soon as pos
sible so that time will be given
for adequate arrangements to he
made; call at the general delivery
window in the post office whether
or not you have a box—many
cards could not be put in boxes,
because of insufficient addresses.
Announcement was also made by
Tatum of an Interfraternity Board
meeting tonight at 7:30 o'clock. He
requested each representative to get
the opinion of his house on the Fi
nancial Plan submitted to it last
week, and to be able to present it
at the meeting tonight.
