### FRANCES AYRES 
Sixteen inches high, of punch
howl proportions, the coveted silver
Intercollegiate tennis trophy reposes
upon President Wilbur's bookcase
while congratulatory messages and
praise pour into his office.
In keen competition among out
standing universities since 101!), and
engraved with names of net cham
pions during those years, the cup
har. been permanently awarded to
Stanford by virtue of seven points
won by past Cardinal stars.
Such racquctecrs as Joe Couglin,
Keith Gledhill, and Sammy Lee,
who aided in securing Ihe cup for
Stanford, won repute for themselves
a; well as their Alma Mater, judging
from the letters received by Presi
dent Wilbur.

' Says the chairman of the Inter
collegiate Tennis Committee:
"I consider it. most fitting lhal this
j Trophy should have been won by a
| great university in the State of Cali
fornia, for it is from your state that
! in the past 15 years so many of our
leading stars have come. None of
j them has made a finer impression
for good sportsmanship and line play
than the representatives of Stanford
University."
From the famous Marion Cricket
Club camc this praise:
"Stanford's representatives have
always stood out in the field of over
100 players who are representative
of the very best of America."
The cup will probably be perma
nently added to the trophy room in
, Encina Gym.
