# 'TINY' CHANGES LINE-UP; READY FOR O.C. GAME
## Sophomore Backfield May Start Against Clubmen This Saturday HAMILTON SET FOR TILT Alustiza Moved to Quarter; May Replace Sim 
### 
Frank Alustiza, that chunky lad
i from Stockton with the questioning
i eyes, will probably finish the rest
j of the season as quarterback. Coach
"Tiny" Thornhill announced last
| night after practice that he had
J shifted Alustiza from his old posi
tion at fullback, and that there was
j a possibility that he might start
against the Olympic Club.
Alustiza .started ihe season in a
j three-way battle with Bobby Gray
j son and Jack Hillman for the full -
! back berth, and came through on
I eve ry chance he had, but for some
j reason he has spent the last two
j games on the bench. There seemed
I to be no room for him in the S.F.U.
| game, and at Washington, where his
I punting would have been invaluable,
| he had to stay on the sidelines bc
j cause Hillman was playing a whale
of a game.
Alustiza at Quarter
j Alustiza had some experience at
{quarter in spring practice, and yes
terday underwent a bit of instruc
tion on the side from Earl Hoos, the
scrappy boy who has come up with
| a rush in the past two games. Alu
j stiza will impart additional threat
! in any backfield, with his 196 pounds
of power quickly convertible to
passing, kicking, or ball-carrying.
Thornhill has indicated that Sat
urday's starter will be a toss-up
between Alustiza, Hoos, and Bill
j Sim.
Hamilton Will Start
| Johnny Reisner will be in at left
half, and Bob Hamilton at right
half. It will be Hamilton's first ap
pearance since he was injured in
the U.C.L.A. game.
Fullback will lie between Hillman
and Grayson. If Grayson starts,
there is an excellent chance of a
completely so p h om or e backfield
opening Ihe game.
The starting position at center is
unsettled. The old reliable Bill
I Bates has been enduring an attack
I of poor passing lately, and Wes Mul
j lor may get a chance to show against
the club.
Try Sophs Against S.C.
Oscar, the office iconoclast, has
put forth the possibility that a team
of sophomores might be started
. against U.S.C., with a good psy
j chological effect. Oscar argues that
[ this sophomore club gave U.S.C. a
i walloping last year as freshmen, and
! thai Ihey certainly do not suffer
I from the old "S.C. is undefeatable"
j complex.
Oscar points out that Alustiza or
Hoos at quarter, with Grayson at
full, and Reisner and Hamilton as
halfbacks would be the backfield.

Hamilton Will Start
| Johnny Reisner will be in at left
half, and Bob Hamilton at right
half. It will be Hamilton's first ap
pearance since he was injured in
the U.C.L.A. game.
Fullback will lie between Hillman
and Grayson. If Grayson starts,
there is an excellent chance of a
completely so p h om or e backfield
opening Ihe game.
The starting position at center is
unsettled. The old reliable Bill
I Bates has been enduring an attack
I of poor passing lately, and Wes Mul
j lor may get a chance to show against
the club.
Try Sophs Against S.C.
Oscar, the office iconoclast, has
put forth the possibility that a team
of sophomores might be started
. against U.S.C., with a good psy
j chological effect. Oscar argues that
[ this sophomore club gave U.S.C. a
i walloping last year as freshmen, and
! thai Ihey certainly do not suffer
I from the old "S.C. is undefeatable"
j complex.
Oscar points out that Alustiza or
Hoos at quarter, with Grayson at
full, and Reisner and Hamilton as
halfbacks would be the backfield.
| Trompas and Moscrip, ends; Calla
way and Reynolds, tackles; Adams
and Rouble, guards; and Alf Bran
din at center. "What a team, what
j a team!" he says. "I'd bet my hot
j cakes on every mother's son of
them."
Frank Alustiza, that chunky lad
i from Stockton with the questioning
i eyes, will probably finish the rest
j of the season as quarterback. Coach
"Tiny" Thornhill announced last
| night after practice that he had
J shifted Alustiza from his old posi
tion at fullback, and that there was
j a possibility that he might start
against the Olympic Club.
Alustiza .started ihe season in a
j three-way battle with Bobby Gray
j son and Jack Hillman for the full -
! back berth, and came through on
I eve ry chance he had, but for some
j reason he has spent the last two
j games on the bench. There seemed
I to be no room for him in the S.F.U.
| game, and at Washington, where his
I punting would have been invaluable,
| he had to stay on the sidelines bc
j cause Hillman was playing a whale
of a game.
Alustiza at Quarter
j Alustiza had some experience at
{quarter in spring practice, and yes
terday underwent a bit of instruc
tion on the side from Earl Hoos, the
scrappy boy who has come up with
| a rush in the past two games. Alu
j stiza will impart additional threat
! in any backfield, with his 196 pounds
of power quickly convertible to
passing, kicking, or ball-carrying.
Thornhill has indicated that Sat
urday's starter will be a toss-up
between Alustiza, Hoos, and Bill
j Sim.
