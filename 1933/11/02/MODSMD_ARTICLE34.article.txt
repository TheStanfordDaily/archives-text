# When Is a Rally a Rally

### 
The oilier day amid fan-faro and excitement it was an
nounced that the Varsity would be at home to the student
body at (lie practice Held. Meet the team, know the team,
listen to the hand, and have a great time was the patter.
So some KM! or so students came out to got acquainted.
What a spectacle: 1 stray dogs racing up and down the
field to the excited whistle of the students. Finally, as
darkness lay its quiet hand over the green turf, the Grays
and the second string put on a scrimmage.
Hut while signal-calling was not exciting to the fans,
those who were fortunately enough located could witness
I lie intramural games in an adjoining lot.
Meanwhile, the first string was being coached in a sep
arate field. Maybe, the first siring was embarrassed at such
a poor turnout or maybe with everyone else they too real
ized how silly was the whole thing. Let's hope so.
The Thornhill policy of letting students in at the prac
tices is splendid, tends to mortalize the football gods. But
why did anyone want to organize it and make something
formal out of the fun.
There seems a determined effort on some people's part
hi ruin student activity by placing it on a scientific, busi
ness-like basis.
liallv Committee, rah, rah, rah!
