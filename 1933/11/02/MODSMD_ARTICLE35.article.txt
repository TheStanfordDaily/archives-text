# A 						Rum Situation
## 
### 
President Wilbur has declared that Hie repeal of pro
hibition will not change the attitude of (lie administration
toward student drinking. "Alcohol and gasoline don't
mix." This is the natural and expected attitude, in fact
the only possible one, that an educational institution could
have.
Yet the fact remains that with repeal will come a some
what awkward situation for both students and adminis
tration. In the old days, before prohibition, the students
didn't have mixed parties in the city. The men students
went into Menlo once a month, drank three glasses of beer
apiece, came hack to the Campus and upset the trolley, and
then went to bed.
Men and women students are now in the habit of going
to the city to dance, at places whose principal business in
short time will be the dispensing of strongly alcoholic
liquor. A definitely stated policy now might prevent com
plications later on.
