# Hoover — Roosevelt — Mussolini
## 
### 
When it became evident that the Crash of "29 was to be
more than a sixty-day hangover from a wild Hull Market,
when it became evident that psychological shots of pollv
annism in the national arm were futile, Hoover acted. He
called in the business barons and talked to them. Every
one agreed to maintain wages, maintain employment. Ev
eryone left the White House full of pious promises and
happy hopes.
Then these barons went back to their baronies and cut
wages, fired employees. They could not trust one another.
They could not resist the opportunity to buy labor cheap
and extract further profits by cutting wages. With vicious
tenacity, the downward spiral spiraled. It ended with the
election of Roosevelt.
Roosevelt wants higher wages and more employment,
the same things (not strangely) that Hoover wanted. The
?\.R.A. seeks these same ends by appealing to the people to
buy only under the Blue Eagle, Blue Eaglers paying higher
wages and hiring more men. The pressure of the populace
is substituted for the promises of the plutocrats.
Rut what if it fails? What if people buy where if is
cheapest and not where the Blue Eagles scream the loud
est? That is very likely what they are apt to do. The blare
of N.R.A. parade drums dies down, interest lags, and shop
pets place a penny saved over "mv country right or
wrong." "My country 'tis of thee" is a swell thing to sing
about but how many will pay 2 cents extra on a can of
asparagus? N.R.A. requires that.
The plutocrats failed. The populace might fail. Then
what ?
Prosperity requires lipping of wages and employment.
If people both high and low refuse, then the government
steps in and says, "Listen here, you will." II you won't,
then they castor oil you. That is Mussolini. If the N.R.A.
fails, the next step is Fascism.
