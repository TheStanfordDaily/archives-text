An orchid to you, Jerome Kern! !
Your "Show Boat" music is just as
good now as it was when New York
(the lucky people) first heard it five
years ago. And when I say just as
good, I mean that it is the finest mu
sical score ever to grace a musical |
show since the Victor Herbert era.
But this time, now that California
has finally gotten a production of
this show you and Oscar Hammer
stein II have woven around the Ed
na Ferber novel, you can congratu
late yourself that Belasco and Cur
ran have given it such a splendid
production.
Edgar MacGregor has done a fine
job of the direction, handling the
large crowds of people with rare j
skill and a highly colorful effect. ,
The settings are on the whole pretty
effective, though how one show can
call for so many is more than I
can see.
You must know by now that
'Of Man River" is not only the
best tunc you put into this show,
but that it is probably the best
you ever wrote, and one which—l
prophesy—will one day come to
be regarded as a genuine negro
folk song. Kenneth Spencer's ren-
dition of it is the highlight of the
show, one calculated to send a
shiver up the spine of the most
blase.
Now that "Bill" song, with P. G.
Wodehouse's lyrics, is another swell
song, and most of us have heard
Helen Morgan sing it, via one me
dium or another. So Estelle Taylor,
imported from the cinema, has a
difficult standard to attain. Her act
ing was excellent, sympathetic, and
strikingly convincing, but her sing
ing seemed to lack volume and con
fidence, so that her "Bill" was!

SHOW BOAT (Kern. Ferber, Hammersiein II)
At the Curran Theatre

something of a disappointment. She
seemed a little surer in her "Can't
Help Lovin' That Man."
The romantic interest of the story
of the love between Magnolia and
Gaylord Ravenal is attractively de
picted by Perry Askam and Char
lotte Lansing. Miss Lansing seemed
unsteady at first, but later warmed
up to a charming characterization,
and her voice was immensely ap
pealing.
Askam, you know, is a great
local favorite, so it's practically
suicidal to say much about him,
but I have the firm conviction that
he is—er—getting old. His voice,
however, is not displeasing, and
his high nates are splendid: more
over, he certainly manages to look
the part. He and Miss Lansing
made the most of "You Are Love,"
"Why Do I Love You," and "Make
Believe."
Probably the most delightful work
in the show, from the point of view
of characterization, was William
Kent's Captain Andy. The audience
loved him, and he was delightful as
ihe gay owner of the show boat.
Cecil Huntington gave an able in
terpretation of the old-maidish wife
of Cap'n Andy.
The comic element was well sus
tained by Nina Olivette, whose sing
ing of "Life Upon the Wicked Stage"
drew one of the best hands of the
evening.
Everyone knows that the plot of
an operetta matters not at all, but
let me say that I consider this one
one of the very best, in fact, quite
worthy of your score.
Thanks to you and your confed
erates for a theatrical field-day,
which heaven help those who miss
it! —Chapin
