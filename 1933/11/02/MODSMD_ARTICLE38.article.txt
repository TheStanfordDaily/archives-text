The Editor, Sir:
That the choice of the Cambridge
debaters has been made a matter of
public concern is to speaker num
ber s's regret. But your humble
aspirant is as much perturbed as is
Mr. Saadi. He casts off his disap
pointment at not being able to have
a maiden aunt in Manchester thrill
to the sound of his voice, and of
being able to flatter himself that
millions of Americans and English
men are being told what's what by j
him. He has swallowed the bitter |
pill and now seeks to reassure him
self that speaker 10 and speaker 5
must bow before those who com- j
mitted themselves more nobly at the
tryouts. I
Sir, is it possible for a newspaper
to err? Forgive me for hoping that (
your report of the tryouts in your
venerable journal as of the 31st,
instant, was made in error. May I |
console myself by trying to indicate
what the truth must have been?
Speaker 10 and myself favor a
rule that graduates shall not take j
part in the debate. We were taken
aback upon being informed that in j
1 his instance there would be no
such rule. Mr. Chapin assured us
that ability was to be the sole basis ;
for decision. He did his best to i
make that certain; not even a win- ,
ning smile was to affect the judges. !
We were given numbers and our
identities were kept very much in
the dark. All 15 tryoutees were to
be judged impartially. A name was j
to carry no weight.
But, Sir, your newspaper insinu
ated in all too vile a fashion that
ability was not the basis for select- \
ing Stanford's team. I desire to as
sure you that in lour years of un
dergraduate debating for Stanford
none were asked to step aside ex
cept for a better man. Yet the re
port has it thus, to wit: "Judges
agreed that one of the graduates is
a better radio speaker than any of
the undergraduate," and using him
would mean an "enhancing of Stan
ford's case." Mr. Bill Rogers and
Mr. Dick van Wagenen are under
graduates; ergo, neither is the grad
uate of said "superior" ability.
In due humility, it must be thus:
your sheet erred. Bill Rogers and
Dick van Wagenen, survivors of a
pure test of ability, are the best
Stanford can offer to speak to two

! nations.
But, of course, if you're right—
well, with a faint blush upon my
cheeks, may I ask that you never
tell, kind sir, if you know who said
"superior" graduate is? I couldn't
beat knowing that it's not me.

graduates; ergo, neither is the grad
uate of said "superior" ability.
In due humility, it must be thus:
your sheet erred. Bill Rogers and

pure test of ability, are the best

But, of course, if you're right—

tell, kind sir, if you know who said
"superior" graduate is? I couldn't
beat knowing that it's not me.

to carry no weight.
