# Puzzling NRA
## 
### 
The NRA is "very puzzling" to Al !
Smith. Latest issue of New Out- j
look, edited by the brown derby j
man, carried an editorial looking :
forward to "an honest test of these!
issues in the courts." Smith is fur
-Iher confounded by the recent sug- j
gestions to create new judgeships!
filled with men sympathetic to NRA. I
Smith intimates that this would j
be dealing from the bottom of the]
deck.
