HEADMAN JONES
fiIVES US A BREAK
Coach Howard Jones of Southern
California, usually a cool and com
petent critic, has announced that he
considers California will have little i
trouble in mopping up Stanford in
the Big Game. "California should
win hands down,'' says Jones. "In
gram has a great lire and a fine j
fighting team."
Tanks, Mr. Jones.
The Headman has also put him-
J".eil on record as believing the Tro
jans will have an easier time against I
Stanford than they did against the
Bears.
T'anks again, Mr. Jones.
Now we are really beginning to
believe Stanford may have some
chance against both of these teams.
Nol because Coach Jones' predic- !
tions are invariably wrong, or that;
he is spouting so much hooey. Not 1
a bit of it.
