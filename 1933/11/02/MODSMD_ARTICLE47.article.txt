						GOOD TIME TO BREAK TRADITIONS
## 
### 
But if Jones and other experts con
tinue in the same strain, Stanford
possibly may be rated the underdog
at Los Angeles November 11. And
just as they would break all tra- I
ditions by being the underdog, they
might break another one* and win
the game. Since v/e've been hang- ;
ing around this institution, Stanford
has always been favored to win the
U.S.C. game, and the pre-game dope 1
has always worked in reverse.
In 3930—we11, Stanford had the
best chance in years to take EI Tro- i
jan into camp. There was much
speculation on the possible size of
the score Stanford was to accumu
late. Ha, ha (that is a graphic in
terpretation of a hollow laugh). The!
score was S.C. 41, Stanford 12, with
Shaver and Musick and Duffield and 1
Mohler making Stanford look like
the Epworth League 130 pounders.
The next year "smart money" was j
all on the Cards. Why? "Pop" had .
devised a new defense—guaranteed I
to stop the Panther Crawl which
was something new then. Also we
had a great passing team. Dusty
Allen could throw passes, and Phil
Moft'et and Don Colvin could catch '
'em.
