# BRADSHAW WORKS FROSH GRIDDERS FOR STATE GAME
## 
### 
Holding to his faith in the po- !
ttney of old-fashioned fundamentals, i
Coach Jimmie Bradshaw last nighi j
sent his freshmen gridders through I
an extended and strenuous session i
in the art of spilling the opposing!
ball-carrier.
Lining his charges up in rows of j
five men each, one behind the other,
Bradshaw sent various ball-carriers j
through the gamut of would-be i
tacklers, some of whom connected
with their man and some of whom |
connected with the turf more often. I
Bettor Tackling Stressed
Occasion for the tackling practice
was the let-down in this department
noticeable in last Saturday's game
with Santa Clara. Though much im
proved over their previous week's |
showing against Menlo, the Babes j
had difficulty in stopping the fleet j
Bronco ball-carriers who consist- |
entiy got away for long gains. Hence |
the emphasis on heads-up, body- |
driving, hard and sure tackling. j
Coming up from San Jose Satur- j
day to give the Indian frosh a slight
workout on the week-end previous
to the Little Big Game will be the
State College first-year team, the
second in the history of the school.
Though not a particularly strong
aggregation, the Staters will be
primed to give the Stanford frosh I
as busy an afternoon as possible.
San Jose Beats Stars
Though probably weak in reserve j
strength, the San Jose team boasts I
several outstanding" ex-prep school j
stars. Harvey Willis, former mem- !
ber of the Paly High team and an i
all-Peninsula Athletic League se- J
lection last year, holds down a first- j
string job. Swartzell, an all-state <
center from Indiana, plays on the '
team, while DuÃŸose and Cannell, a
couple of outstanding guards from 1
Mission High in San Francisco, also
hold down first-string berths.
Captain Dale Beedle, Stanford's
outstanding freshman tackle, was
back in uniform last night after
being out for more than a week j
withan injured leg.
