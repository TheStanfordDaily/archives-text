Roosevelt's gold price was upped
another J4 cents yesterday. On the
Frc nch exchange the dollar dropped 1
I'gain. It is now worth 65.11 cents.!
Prof. Frederick Soddy, Oxford
economist, thinks that Roosevelt's
Â£old policy is pretty futile. He says: ;
"Gold has no real relation to the,
price level at the present time ex- J
cept as a smoke screen. It matters j
only within" the ''limits set by anti-1
quated banking rules."
France is considering putting on
an embargo on gold if the U.S. pur- '
( bases become uncomfortably heavy. |
