# COACHES ARGUE OVER BIG GAME
## 
### 
Old Boy James Algar, crafty, cun
ning. cagey coach of the Chaparral
gridiron contingent, today dropped
a bombshell in the Daily shack. Said
he: "Tinkle Molehiii is a myth."
Replied chubby-cheeked, swarthy,
curly-thatched "Honest Abe" Mel
linkoff: "You myth your guess."
Leering from his second-floor
window in the Press Building at
what he called "the Daily riff-raff,"
Old Cuckoo Algar disparaged the
Daily Board of Strategy, claimed it
a fake, declared a smokescreen,
promised a giant expose of its weak
nesses when his lean, lanky, gag
sters take the field against the touted
Dailyites on November 18.
"Pun formation," shouted Algar
and immediately the Chappies let go
a hearty chortle as they taunted
their rivals in the squat Daily shack.
Rooting sections on both sides of
the stadium were reported to have
doubled in size over the week-end. 1
A third cousin of the red-haired j
Chaparral pilot is believed to have
declared he would attend the gala j
pageant, provided he can borrow the
Old Boy's student body card. He's
only seventy-eight and with a root
er's cap could easily pass for a
sophomore. *
sleepy-eyed Dekes who showed up
to play Sigma Nu. They went un
der 19 to 0. The passing of Bud
Shreve was the feature of the game.
A safety and a 40-yard run on an
intercepted pass gave Encina IE vic
tory over Encina IIE in a slow, cr-j
ratically played game. Joe Weiner j
made the interception and run.
