# SAN JOSE STATE SOCCERMEN HOLD STANFORD TO TIE
## 
### 
In a hard, speedy game during
which the score see-sawed radically,
the Stanford soccermen were held
to a 3 to 3 draw by San Jose Junior
College yesterday afternoon. Even
with a semi-nocturnal extra-period
the tied sums remained unchanged.
Ending the first quarter two points
in arrears, the Warrior varsity men
Â»ut down the lead 2 to I by half
time. They bombarded the enemy
go;il to get a 3 to 2 lead as the last'
quarter began. In that period the
Jiiysee forward line rang up its last
point to tie Stanford, maintaining
that score through two five-minute
scrimmages in an extra - period
played in darkness.
Rough Playing Noticeable
Rough playing on the muddy turf
characterized the game, the many
louls indicating the fervor of (he
playing. Several had been called
even. by the first quarter, after
which Art Hearn,- center forward,
began Stanford's 3-point rally by
smacking the ball into the Jaysee
net on a nice head pass from Win
stead "Ghak" Weaver.
Three new men went on the field
et the start of the half and one, Don
Hanson, was responsible for the
third tally by a short jab kick
which swung the ball up into the
San Jose goal. Sven Doddington,
right inside, accounted for the In
dians' second point, taking a neat
pass from Carl Knecht, captain, and
working it up into scoring position.
A beautiful kick put it past the op
ponents' goalposts.
Knecht played one of the fastest,
cleverest games on the field, giving
strength to the forward line with its
Hearn, Miguel Gomez, Bud Krebbs,
and Weaver as offensive powers.
Johnnie Moore, being shifted up to
the forward wall at the half, gave
his unusual stamina and ability to
keep San Jose on defense largely
thenceforth.
Break Brings Score
At halfback Moore, Rudy Gon
zales, and Johnny Hitchcock started
the game and played very well. The
scores of the fix'st quarter were due
pi'incipally to uncertainty in the
fullback. At the half time White
went in and Moore moved up to the
forward line.
Fullbacks Dick Strouse and Rod
Lewis began the game for Stanford.
Cy Johnson, skilled booter and re
liable full, went in for Lewis at the
half.
Playing for San Jose, Doug Tay
lor, center halfback, was the' star,
making their second score, an unu
sual single-handed feat for a half. ,
Johnnie Moore kept Taylor in hand
during the rest of the contest, keep
