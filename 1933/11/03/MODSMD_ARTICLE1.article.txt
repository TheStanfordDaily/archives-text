## Swope Plan Sequels 
### 
Developments followed thicjt and
fast upon the trail of the new but
already famous Swope Plan. Most
marked was the division of opinion
within industry itself. Potent, lob
bying National Association of Manu
facturers opposed the proposed su
per Chamber of Commerce, desired
to remain autonomous, feared two
interfering bodies instead of one.
Real driving force behind the
plan lies in the now widespread fear
thai NRA is but a stepping-stone to
State Capitalism, Government con
trol and operation of most every
thing. To counteract this tendency,
industry would set up a body to
act as a court of appeal for the
administration of the codes.
Hope is that this set-up would
supplement NRA, supplant it when
and if il goes out of existence, thus
establishing capitalist-controlled in
dustry with the minimum of Gov
ernment interference.
Somewhat on the sidelines, labor
did not view this latest effort at
"business fascism" with any too
much pleasure, AFL President Bill
Green was frankly .sceptical, doubt
ed whether they Swope plan would
afford same protection for labor as
NRA.

Government, the third party 7n
the matter, did not propose to relax
its supervision and veto power over
industry. Irked by Hearst-sniping
at his charge, bespectacled General
Johnson hit back, denied that Swope
Plan would interfere, hoped it would
help industrial self-discipline.
Washington observers recalled
that public-minded G.E. President
Swope had started the "share-work"
plan, essential basis of F.R.'s re
employment campaign, ventured the
guess that he had again hit the
mark.
