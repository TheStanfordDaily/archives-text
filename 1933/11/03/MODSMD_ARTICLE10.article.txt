# Sadler Urges Subjects Okay Quad Photo Proofs
## 
### 
Emphasis was placed on the fact
that Quad photograph proofs must
be called for and approved before
I hey can be put into the yearbook,
by A1 Sadler, editor, last night.
"Positively no pictures will be print
ed until okehed by the subject," he
stated, "and the sooner this is done,
the better."
All fraternities are asked to view
their proofs, with the following ex
ceptions: Alpha Delta Phi, Theta
Delta Chi, Theta Xi, and Zeta Psi.
They are to be seen on the second
floor of the Press Building.
Members of the following groups
will be photographed today: El Toro,
El Campo, and the Japanese Club.
