# A.W.S. Aids '37 Guidance
## Plans for Vocational Help For Lower Division 
### 
That Stanford women may be
graduated #with feet (irmly planted
in suitable vocational paths, the
A.W.S. Vocational Guidance Com
mittee, headed by Sponsor Marian
Pfoffenberger, announced yesterday
its plans for the year.
Especially interested in contacting
lower division women in order to
enable them to decide on vocational
majors for upper division work, the
committee has established a voca
tional reference library in the office
of the Dean of Women and has ar
ranged that all perplexed freshman,
and sophomore women may fill out
vocational interest inventory blanks.
The guidance work was begun
with freshman women last year and
is being continued with the sopho
more class under the general super
vision of Miss Benetta Merner, Mar
iposa's Head Resident. In Roble and
in Madrono, under the respective
wings of Miss Anastasia Doyle and
Miss Alice Ingraham, this year's
fresTiman crop is being oriented.
Miss Doyle and Miss Ingraham
plan to interview all freshmen in
the two houses on the general sub
ject of vocational interests, and will
have available vocational interest
check lists which undecided women
may utilize. If they wish to dis
cover further their vocational tend
encies, they may also fill out the
vocational interest inventory blanks.
Members of the A.W.S. committee
will instruct and assist in this lat
ter work.

Marion Hattersley, Marian Jones,
Dorothea Snively, Dorothy Anne
Jackson, and Jane Humbird com

Cohen are sophomore aides to Miss
Merner, who will be in her ofTice,
