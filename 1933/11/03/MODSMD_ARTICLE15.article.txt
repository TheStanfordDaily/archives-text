# Rare Pieces Presented To Hoover War Library
## 
### 
A five-inch shell from French bat
tlefields, a deadly hand grenade of
the "potato masher" variety, a thick
saber encrusted with soil from the
banks of the Rhineâ€”these are only
a few of the gifts constantly being
sent the Hoover War Library.
Although its director, World War
expert Ralph H. Lutz, says the Li
brary has no intention of collecting
museum pieces, it nevertheless con
tinues to receive them.
If not presented to the Stanford
museum, the gifts are kept among
the long lines of shelves in back of
the War Library where that drama
played by the world from 1914 to
1.918 is neatly stacked and cata
logued.
Interesting and valuable are three
studded placques set up here. Fash
ioned from the tops of beer barrels,
they formerly hung the walls of
German school rooms where they
symbolized the war spirit of the
children. The militaristic designs
{'ie of nails, each of which was sold
to the children in order to raise J
money for relief of war orphans, J

[Significant is the motto studded on
cne of them: "The highest good lies
! in the sWord."
Among the Library's rare posscs-
I sions, is a Lusitaniu medal, issued
in Germany to celebrate the sink
ing of the ship. The gruesome en
graving depicts doomed Americans
buying passages at the Cunard line's
offices. The ticket seller is por
trayed as Death.
One of the most unusual collec
tions at the War Library is the group
of presents given Herbert Hoover
by the Belgian children in appre
ciation of his aid as chairman of the
Commission for the Relief of Bel
gium. The .sacks, lull of grain, were
[sent to Belgium during the German
occupation, were returned in the
forms of bags, tennis racquet covers,
Hags, and table cloths.
Also received by the War Library,
which will have to add a display
room if the collection increases, are
an invaluable group of Romanoff
photographs, priceless Belgian laces,
| and mementoes from Hoover's re
j 11<! work in central Europe.
