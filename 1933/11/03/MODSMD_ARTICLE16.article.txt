### 
Coming on the eve of the first
rushing period of the men of '37
was the announcement by the Inter
fraternity Board that fraternity men
| may accompany rushees to Shaw's
j play, "Arms and the Man," tonight-
Interfraternity Council President
• Donn Tatum explained the action
| as not the granting of special per
mission to fraternities, but merely
the result of the interpretation of
the rushing rule which reads: "Nor
mal contact of a 'public and infor
! mal' nature is permissible on the
I campus between fraternity men and
! new lower division men."
II Pledges Allowed
Under this rule, as "public and
! informal contact," it will be per
j missible for row men to go with
! freshmen to the Assembly Hall play
1 this evening, says the Board—pro
] viding, however, that freshmen buy
| their own tickets.
I Outstanding among other business
j transacted at the Board meeting last
; night was the raising of the number
; of pledges allowed each house to 14,
j Only 12 men from '36 were allowed
! to pledge each house last year.
Move Is Compromise
In acting favorably on this recom
mendation by the Interfraternity
I Council, Tatum states that the Board
i hopes to effect a compromise be
i tween the itnerests of small and
! large houses on the campus. Last
| year's limit of 12, he says, was set
| in order to protect the small houses.
This year, on the other hand, the
J Board feels that the large houses
I should be allowed to pledge larger
j classes; but sets the limit at 14 in
j order to prevent abnormally large
! pledge classes and to safeguard the
! interests of the smaller houses.
