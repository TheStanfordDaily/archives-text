# Teams Debate Free Speech
## 
### 
From behind the Little Theatre
rostrum on which is graven: "Die
Luft Dcr Freiheit Weht," two Cali
fornia coeds last night taunted Stan
ford debaters, who valiantly cham
pioned the cause of absolute free
speech. .Jeanne Millard opened the
meeting.
A John Lyman, who took to heav
| ing verbal instead of iron shots,
i opened the evening's discussion with
i (he logical remark that no one is
j adequately qualified to decide what
should be suppressedâ€”once it is de
: termined to limit absolute freedom
i of speech.
Women, always practical, last
; night more so than ever, argued it
j was impossible and undesirable to
i have absolute freedom under all cir
| eumstances. California/is Knapp and
j Futnam, almost twins in their close
| matched brown ensembles, stood up
well under heckling from the floor,
said thai most truths would stand
up under the most severe censor
ship.
"Grappling" Gantier, in complete
i command of the .'peaking platform,
j subjugated the soundness of his the
j sis that (1) absolute free speech is
jntcesvary in a democracy, and (2)
that such freedom serves as a peo
ple's safety value, to the humor of
i his illustrations.
