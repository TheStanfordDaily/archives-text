# FROSH AGAIN QUELL HOPES FOR BONFIRE
## Freshmen Student Leaders Decide Against Move To Light Pyre 
### Russell Ulrich 
Stanford's famous Big Game bon
fire seems sure to remain in the
discard as the result of a meeting
of the freshman class, who voted
no, by a large majority, to the re
turn of the former focal point of the
Big Game rally, for which the
freshmen ordinarily are responsible.
A crowd found seats on chairs,
tables, and the floor or stood as
closely as possible around the big
fireplace in the Encina lobby at
seven last night, engaging in a half
hour of hot discussion, finally de
cided to drop the bonfire, but left
the question open till a further dis
cussion should be in order.
The meeting was in charge of
Don Read, secretary of the class, as
Ted Geissler, the president, was
absent. The first speaker to gain
the floor was big Jack Walton, a
back on the freshman football
team. Walton declared that the up
perclassmen would try to have the
bonfire continued on the ground
that it was an old tradition and a
glorious spectacle, but that the
freshmen would be the goats of the
whole school if they spent every
cent in their treasui'y and most of
their breakage fee to pile up a big
stack of wood and then send it up
in smoke. His speech was well re
ceived by the assemblage.
Don Read then took the floor
again, stressing the fact that the
work involved in building and
guarding the bonfire must also be
considered. He called for volun
teers who would be willing to carry
the job through, and got only a
half-hearted response. The discus
sion was continued by several
speakers.
At this point two opposite view
points became prevalent—one that
the bonfire was too old a tradition
and too important to the Big Game
rally to be stopped, especially if the
co-operation of the upperclassmen
could be enlisted, and the other
viewpoint that a new method should
be found to focus the Big Game
rally spirit.
Several propositions were made by
different speakers to put the money
into a "super jolly-up" or a barn
dance and vaudeville show for the
exclusive benefit of the freshmen,
but it was also strongly brought out
that the bonfire was an affair for
the whole university and any sub
stitute for it could be nothing less.
Another speaker suggested the con
struction of a large "S" on the side
of a nearby mountain. Still another
freshman took the floor to announce
that 25 boys had been working on
a project to take the place of the
bonfire and would soon disclose its
nature.
The motion was put and caxried
that the bonfire should be put to a
yes or no vote and the question of
a substitute left for a later meeting.
The vote was about four to one
against the bonfire.
A "Big Game Gaieties" vaudeville
show and a Big Game jolly-up are
already fixtures at Stanford and
this year a dance is being discussed
for the night after the game. Some
enterprising freshman may yet think
of a stunt which will take the place
of the bonfire and be acceptable to
his classmates.

teers who would be willing to carry
the job through, and got only a
half-hearted response. The discus
sion was continued by several
speakers.
At this point two opposite view
points became prevalent—one that
the bonfire was too old a tradition
and too important to the Big Game
rally to be stopped, especially if the
co-operation of the upperclassmen
could be enlisted, and the other
viewpoint that a new method should
be found to focus the Big Game
rally spirit.
Several propositions were made by
different speakers to put the money
into a "super jolly-up" or a barn
dance and vaudeville show for the
exclusive benefit of the freshmen,
but it was also strongly brought out
that the bonfire was an affair for
the whole university and any sub
stitute for it could be nothing less.
Another speaker suggested the con
struction of a large "S" on the side
of a nearby mountain. Still another
freshman took the floor to announce
that 25 boys had been working on
a project to take the place of the
bonfire and would soon disclose its
nature.
The motion was put and caxried
that the bonfire should be put to a
yes or no vote and the question of
a substitute left for a later meeting.
The vote was about four to one
against the bonfire.
A "Big Game Gaieties" vaudeville
show and a Big Game jolly-up are
already fixtures at Stanford and
this year a dance is being discussed
for the night after the game. Some
enterprising freshman may yet think
of a stunt which will take the place
of the bonfire and be acceptable to
his classmates.
Stanford's famous Big Game bon
fire seems sure to remain in the
discard as the result of a meeting
of the freshman class, who voted
no, by a large majority, to the re
turn of the former focal point of the
Big Game rally, for which the
freshmen ordinarily are responsible.
A crowd found seats on chairs,
tables, and the floor or stood as
closely as possible around the big
fireplace in the Encina lobby at
seven last night, engaging in a half
hour of hot discussion, finally de
cided to drop the bonfire, but left
the question open till a further dis
cussion should be in order.
The meeting was in charge of
Don Read, secretary of the class, as
Ted Geissler, the president, was
absent. The first speaker to gain
the floor was big Jack Walton, a
back on the freshman football
team. Walton declared that the up
perclassmen would try to have the
bonfire continued on the ground
that it was an old tradition and a
glorious spectacle, but that the
freshmen would be the goats of the
whole school if they spent every
cent in their treasui'y and most of
their breakage fee to pile up a big
stack of wood and then send it up
in smoke. His speech was well re
ceived by the assemblage.
Don Read then took the floor
again, stressing the fact that the
work involved in building and
guarding the bonfire must also be
considered. He called for volun
teers who would be willing to carry
the job through, and got only a
half-hearted response. The discus
sion was continued by several
speakers.
