# '37 PAJAMERINO IS OUT-HABLES
## 
### 
Tradition-killing struck at an
other long-time custom last night,
when the A.S.S.U. office through
Manager Les Hables, announced that
the Frosh Pajamarino is no moreâ€”
jat least for this year.
Student Manager Hables set forth
four reasons for this decision:
1. Ex Committee was not asked
to set a date.
2. Ex Committee's okeh was not
applied for.
3. Plan was not cleared through
the Deans' offices.
4. Encina and Roble sponsors were
not given sufficient time to prepare.
Pajamarino has long been a fresh
man privilege. Parading from En
cina to Roble, via the Row, much
j noise and anti-Cal excitement has
been yearly generated.
Last year, more energetic of the
frosh entered Roble by way of the
French windows, after which sere
nading and yelling, much to the
discomfiture of the sponsors and ma
trons. After Roble, the usual pro
cedure is to "crash" a Palo Alto
movie.
This year's Pajamarino was ex
pected to be held next Wednesday,
celebrating the Little Big Game on
i November 11, and had been an
nounced in the Daily to have oc
curred at that time.
