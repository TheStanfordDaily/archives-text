Hollow-eyed sockets staring out
ol a dark, cold "bone" room, the
largest bear skull in the world rests
in the University of California ver
tebrate museum.
Hidden from the curious eyes of
the public, the large skull, once that
of an Alaskan brown bear, is kept
in a frigid room with about 200
other skulls and remains of reptiles
arc' mammals, for the edification of
privileged zoologists. The remains
are preserved by the cold tempera
