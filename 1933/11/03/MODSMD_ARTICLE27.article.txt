George Bernard Shuw at his wili
est and wittiest, Harold Helvenslon's
direction and settings, a cast of
eight capable performers -mix well,
and what have you got? Not Mag
nolia, but "Arms and the Man," and
incidentally -oh, very incidentally—
Entertainment.
That is tonight's offering of the
Dramatic Council, campus impre
sarios, who are presenting the play
at 8:30 sharp to the Assembly Hall
audience.
The curtain will part (or is it
rise?) on the bedroom of Raina,
daughter of the land-holding Pet
koffs, the only family in Bulgaria
who own a library, and thencefor
ward the action will deal with the
Serbia-Bulgaria war and the Raina-
Bluntschli romance.
"New Blood" Appears
To depict the* action of the Shaw
play Helvenston has, as is his cus
tom, chosen a cast of experienced
players mingled with some "new
blood," the latter being even more
promising than usual.
Jean Albertson tonight makes her
initial appearance under the Hel-

i venston tutelage, having previously
appeared in "An Ideal Husband"
and "Major Barbara," Sword and
' Sandals readings.
Paul Crary has now attained the
! "veteran" classification, after two
sterling performances last year —
"An Enemy of the People" and
"Hawk Island." George Fuller, how
ever, makes his debut tonight, in
the part of the Prussian officer,
leavens at His Best
With two previous appearances to
his credit, George Leavens of
"Death Takes a Holiday" and "The
Mad Hopes," will enact his best role
in tonight's satire.
Mary Anita Loos is the mfcst sea
soned performer of the group, hav
ing previously appeared in three
major productions and two extrava
ganzas. She has the lead role, Raina.
Virginia Marvin, a senior trans
| fer, is likewise to be seen on the
Assembly Hall stage for the first
time tonight, and her interpretation
of Catherine should prove highly
interesting.
Pcckham as Bluntschli
One of the outstanding members
of the casts of "Hawk Island" and
"Holiday," John Peckham will to
night interpret the difficult role of
Captain Bluntschli.
Waldo Salt, known locally as a
writer of plays as well as a per
