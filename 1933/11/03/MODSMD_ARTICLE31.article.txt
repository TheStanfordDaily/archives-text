# Arms and the Man

If is the usual custom for collegiate editors to exhort
the student body to support this or that campus activity.
The reason given is loyalty to the t'niversitv, etc., etc. JUil
the real appeal with such things as dramatics should he the
genuine pleasure derived.
That is why the campus should attend "Arms and the
Man" tonight in the Assembly Hall. Forget the duty. Re
member the pleasure. Stanford dramatic productions are
polished affairs decidedly not corn-fed. It is a treat to
he able to attend them. II is marvelous what work is done
with amateur actors, and it is surprising what latent is
found on this "Farm."
And tonight's plav will probably be much better than
many because of the excellent choice of play. "Arms and
the Man" is one of Bernard Shaw's most interesting. No
lablv absent is the long-winded debating that makes Shaw
plays excellent reading, poor dramatic presentations. The
Shaw propaganda is present as always but concealed in
clever dialogue and amusing situations.
With the notably low state of the cinema, and the
equally notable expense of running to San Francisco, a
sell-out for tonight's play would not be surprising. It is
indeed unfortunate that Stanford's Assembly Hall does not
accommodate the entire campus for they will probably he
at the doors lighting to get in.
As with dramatics, so with other campus attractions,
it is futile to appeal to duty for support. College students
in common with most other people are not martyrs. A
Friday night is a thing to enjoy, not a time to do penance
for some cause. The fact that the cause is noble is imma
terial.
While it helps Ihe A.S.S.T. immensely to have the plays
well attended, no one is asking students to attend for that
reason. In the name of seltish enjoyment, go, and be
pleased.
