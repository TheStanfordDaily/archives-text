# A 						New Test for the "800"
## 
### 
The entrance committee sized tlierti up on paper only.
Roughs gave them a glance on the dance floor at the Pres
ident's reception. The Row looked them over at the Con
ference party. Professors rated them on the class average.
At the Annual Triangular Sports Day tomorrow the
t'liiversity of California and Mills College will form their
opinions of the athletic ability of Stanford's "800." Inter
collegiate competition is forbidden, of course, but the col
legiate winners will be known just the same.
May the "800" pass this lest as well as tliev did all
others.
