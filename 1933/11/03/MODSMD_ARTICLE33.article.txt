# Collegiana and Common Sense
## 
### 
Harely a week ago, the Daii.y asked hall residents to
co-operate with campus police to the extent of locking
their doors when away at classes. Today comes the news
that a fourth fraternity house was entered over the week
end and a small amount of money taken.
It may be collegiate to leave the front door open 21
hours a day, but we venture to say that most of the house
brethren don't follow that practice when they are at their
fiunily homes. These "open door policies" are swell ideas
for professional prowlers who lour the country from
campus to campus raiding living groups. The toll is getting
off to a great start here, having mounted to around .%'JOO
already.
As was s;iid in a previous editorial, it is an impossibility
to expect the three campus policemen to watch every door
on the Farm.
Less collegiana and more common sense will save
money in tile long run. How about house managers pro
viding members with keys?
