# BULL SESSION
## "ALCOHOL AND GASOLINE DO NO MIX?" 
### 
The triumph of reality over the
ory is one which has put many men
in the White House, and many more
in the poor house. Like castor oil,
theories are nice to have, but hard
to swallow. And since swallowing
is one of the more complicated re
flexes, the mass simplifies this proc
ess as much as possible by imbibing
long, heavily, and exclusively of
"things as they are."
At Stanford, as elsewhere, the ma
jority has never been bothered a
great deal with the theory of pro
hibition. Between schooners of beer
and snifters of Scotch, the rough has
reminded newcomers that thei'e is
a law against drinking. But. the
restriction, on campus and off, has
been a sort of constitutional appen
dix. Nationally, some few have
thought it necessary to shout for
repeal to restore man his inherited
rights. Locally, there has been no
such waste of breath; for both rights
and rites have never been taken
away.
The question of the solubility* of
hi-octane in old bourbon is one that
has troubled no one at Stanford ex
cept the administration. For though
dictum says the mixture is an im
possible one, custom .says the. mix
ture exists. Ever since Encina men
stole President Harrison's fine li
quor, because he was keeping it on

I the campus "against the law," stu
| dents have? found that while the
! blowing of the Wind of Freedom
I has been sporadic, the flowing of
i the' spirits of alcohol has been in
| cessant.
When the Public Forum next week
discusses the Farm Liquor Law, the
| affirmative favoring '"prohibition of
intoxicating liquors on the Stanford
iCtmpus" will be arguing for a
j change in the present system. For
we do have beer, though 110 repeal.
The same arguments used for re
peal of the 18 amendment cannot
apply to the little-heeded Article I,
! Section 5, of the A.S.S.U. By-Laws:
(here is no time and less money
wasted on enforcement; gangsterism
has not sprung up locally in the dis
tribution of the stuff —which leads
| some to suspect that Stanford men
; are gentlemen.
i But there is one ever-potent talk
in!.; point. When gasoline and fusel
oil do mix, il is time to begin think
ing of preserving student integrity,
physically and mentally. Official re
peal on the campus is possible. For
though Senator Stanford favored a
dry University, Mrs. Stanford also
favored a male campus. Finance
demanded th;it the "500" get out;
honesty demands that repeal come
in! —Dave Mellinkoff
