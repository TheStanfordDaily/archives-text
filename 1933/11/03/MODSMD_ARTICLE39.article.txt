BOMBSHELL (M.G.M.)
At the Stanford Theatre
j A bit of "Blessed Event," a dash
j of "What Price Hollywood?" a faint
, touch of "Another Language," and :
an overdose of exaggeration is the i
formula for this fastest-moving film i
i since the advent of screen "exposes."
i The picture reveals the methods;
| largely dubious ones, by which the
| reputation and glamor surrounding
| a motion picture star are created,
ill may appeal to a daring
; exposure, or it may impress those
j who know Hollywood as a good
deal of ado about very little. At
j any rate, the incidents are fairly
well strung together and are novel
i c nough to sustain interest and pass
for plot.
Jean Harlow appears as Lola |
Burns, movie actress, whose out
standing attributes seem to be a.
; drunken father, a bum brother, and
; a public which will devour all the
1 hokum dished up for it by Space
jHanion, publicity agent. Lee Tracy!
I plays this latter role with his usual j
| single characterization, and is, if '•
' possible, slightly more vigorous than
| ever before. (And it is enough to
I try the patience of the sturdiest
spectator to hear him call Miss Har
row, "Sugar" about a dozen times.) |
La Harlow makes the picture the
; rapid-moving and entertaining af
i fair that it is. She manages to at
tain a genuine characterization of j
the simple but harrassed actress, 1
j and is extremely deft in depicting |
: her lightning-like changes of mood.
Franchot Tone appears briefly, !
I but to excellent advantage, display
ing a hitherto undiscovered gift for
! burlesque. —Chapin
I LOVED A WOMAN (Warner)
! At the Varsity Theatre
! Disguised with one of Hollywood's
| usual misleading titles, "I Loved a \
j Woman" proves to be Warner's con- '
|ti'ibution to the ever-growing num
! ber of recent cinematic biographies
Jof capitalistic tycoons. With a great 1
: deal of historical accuracy, this one i
j tells of the rise of Chicago's meat-
J packing trust, and of one man in
j particular, John Hayden. Edward G.
| Robinson plays this role most con
; vJncingly and thereby adds another
! character to his already varied rep
-1 ertoire.
, I In youth, Hayden rich, idl-
L j ing dilettante. After marriage he
j sinks rapidly into the oft-portrayed
. domestic sloth. Then he meets a
I caieer-seeking singer who tells him
; that by building his business to
j "visionary heights" he, as its crea
tor. will have formed a thing of
I beauty. He readies his goal, only to
! discover that the "woman he loved"
i has placed her affections elsewhere
and has used him only for money
. j and power. In a lury, lie declares
, I that he will build "so high that she
, | will never reach him." He launches
,! on a campaign of ruthless capitalism
. ' which eventually, thru' its narrow,
J egotistical selfishness brings his ar-
I tificial w>orld tumbling about his
| ears. Kay Francis, in the role of
I the singer, surprises with her voice,
end Genevieve Tobin, as the disil
r | lusioned, revenge-seeking wife, is
splendid and quite fascinating.
[ If interested in historical epics
! and strong biographical portrayals,
I you will enjoy this picture. The di
! rection is smooth and the tempo un
| usually even for this type of pro
k ! duct ion. The detail accuracy, too,
| is to be commended. —Brill
