CAMBRIDGE POT STILL BOILS
The Editor, Sir:
I am unhappy.
One of yesterday's campus opin
ions made me feel that it was almost
a personal affront to five professors
for me to question a Daily news
story, and to wonder about the
technique of selecting debaters. It
almost made me feel ashamed of
myself for not fully appreciating the
sacrifices made by live professors
for the sake of 15 unnamed de
baters.
Now I'm sure Professors Bassett,
Davis, and Bailey hold 110 ill feel
ing toward me. I might apologize
to -them if they did. I might apolo
gize to the other two "professors"
too if I could find their names among
the list of professors in the Bawl
out.
I might even feel humble- and
apologize to Mr. Chapin for my
heresy—if he would come out and
unequivocally deny the story pub
lished in the Dippy or answer the
few questions I submitted.
As for you, Mr. Botasof. you may
as well know that you were the best
speaker mentioned. I would advise
you to get your scissors and clip
that story—to be shown to your
grandchildren. That would make up
| tor the favorite aunts that will miss
I your voice over the radio.
Yours,
Mitchel Saadi.
