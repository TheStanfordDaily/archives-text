# FOOTBALL HELPS ALUMNI CONCLAVE ACTIVITY--ROTHERT
## 
### George Wilson 
The football season finds alumni
clubs everywhere in the midst oi
their busiest months of the year,
with graduates evincing unusual
interest in campus activities, not
only on the gridiron, but in the
classroom and social group as well.
This is the report of Executive
Alumni Secretary Harlow Rothert,
who has personally contacted many
clubs already this fall.
Due to efforts on the part of Stan
ford officials, some of whom have
been present at every large alumni
gathering of recent date, graduates
find it easier than ever before to
keep in touch with those now on
the campus, says Rothert. President
Wilbur has met with many groups
and is anxious to discuss current
University problems with more ot
them. He will meet with the San
Jose alumni on Tuesday.
Officials here are kept busy com
plying with requests from alumni
to show moving pictures of the team
in action, and views of recent
changes on the Farm, reports Ro
thert, Graduates continually ask
about registration figures, the new
women, and when there will be an
opportunity for another Alumni
Economic Conference such as was
held last spring, he says.
With interest naturally centering
on Southern California next week,
many alumni gatherings are planned
for the lower end of the state, cliâ€”
jr.axing in a large football rally at
the Jonathan Club in Los Angeles
on November 10. Almon Roth, J. E.
McDowell, Harlow Rothert, Dink
Templeton, Don Liebendorfer, and
others plan to be present at as many j
of them as possible.
Rothert hopes to be able to bring
undergraduates to the realization of
what alumni are doing, and helping
each year's graduates to contact
alumni in the part of the country in !
which they may happen to live.
Only by proper co-operation be- j
tween student and alumni groups, !
he says, can Stanford realize all its ,
hopes. Such co-operation is what j
the alumni office is making its job j
to bring about.
