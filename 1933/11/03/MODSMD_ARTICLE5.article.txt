# Eligible Henry
## 
### 
Co-operative Senator Robert Wag
ner, head of the National Labor
Board, says individual Henry Ford
is complying with NRA, tind al
though h â–  has not signed NRA's
Auto Code, he is eligible to bid for
government contracts.
Herr Ford is turning in wage and
hour rates to National Auto Cham
ber of Commerce, has bargained
with stliking, union-forming Ford
i un at Chester, Penn., and Edge
watcr (not Beach), N.J. He has not
satisfied their demands but has
trlked it over with their represen
tatives, and so is playing ball.
All's well even if Gen. Johnson
doesn't like it; even if NRA con
tii ues to keep "unofficial observers"
at the plants.
