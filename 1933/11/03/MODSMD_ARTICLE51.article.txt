# VETERANS BACK IN SOCCER PLAY
## 
### 
Two first-string veterans returned
| iii uniform to bolster up the soccer
| varsity in yesterday's practice and
for tomorrow morning's Conference
j game with San Mateo J.C. Doug
[Kennedy, returning to the roll of
eligible players, came out to take
over the center half position. Cy
Johnson, other returnee, was in
stalled at left fullback to supple
ment the two outstanding right full
back contestants, Rod Lewis and
Dick Strouse.
With Johnnie Moore, who cov
ered the niidfield halfback posi
tion before Kennedy's return,
shifted up to inside right to feed
the ball to Art Hearn and Win
stead "Doodle" Weaver, the for
ward line received its share of
strengthening.
In the scrimmage which took
place against the extraordinary
freshman team, the fortified varsity
slowly piled up a 3 to 0 score. Hearn
scored the first tally. Weaver, who
started at inside left as a reward
for startling improvement, shot a
powerful one-yard jab to score the
second point. Rudy Gonzales and;
Kennedy, halfs, 'played excellent
soccer against the frosh. Johnny;
Hitchcock was on the injured list
and Waddy White waddled around
in his stead at left half.
Frosh Team Good
Giving the varsity its greatest op- j
position, l'reshmen first-stringers Ed
Washburn, fullback, and Bola Hall,
left half, led their team-mate.:.
These same team-mates comprise
the best frosh team which has been j
produced in some years.
However, they found difficulty in
holding the varsity offensive
which is hoping to break up Stan
ford's .500 Conference standing in
the San Mateo contest tomorrow.
As usual Knecht looked fine, even j
playing inside left, while Don Han - ;
sen took his old berth as left wing.
Sven Doddington romped up and
down the right edge of ihe turf
playing right wing.
Starting Line-up
The possible starting line-up for
tomorrow's San Mateo contest: Han
son, Knecht, Hearn, Moore, and
Doddington. Weaver may replace
one of these to begin the scrap.
It is very likely that goalie Jack
King will start Saturday's game,
although Milt Newman, who has j
been playing often and well in
practice, may get his chance to
shine.
