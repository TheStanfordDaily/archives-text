## 
### 
Comparison of results of the Cali
fornia State Bar examinations held
in August, 1932, and February, 1933,
.show that only Stanford and Har
vard Law Schools were successful
in having all of their graduates ac
cepted, figures published recently in
the State Bar Journal show.
Of the 511 college graduates, rep
resenting over 30 schools taking the
examination, about 65 per cent
passed. Forty-five Stanford students
took the examinations in which
20 Harvard men were among the
successful entrants. The percent
ages of students passing from Cali
fornia universities included Califor
nia with 96.4, Southern California
with 98.1, and Hastings College in
San Francisco with 91.9 per cent.

What! No coeds? For the first time
in 42 years Gettysburg college has
no women students enrolled.
