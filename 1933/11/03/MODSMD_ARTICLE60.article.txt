# BAR CRITICIZES LAW SCHOOLS
## 
### 
Marked contrast between the se
lective and competitive standards of
the medical schools of the nation
and the poorer status of the law
.schools is condemned in a bulletin
issued recently by the American Bar
Association, it was disclosed by C.
Gilbert Wrenn, vocational guidance
director here.
Figures reveal that while 50 per
cent of the students applying for
admission to medical schools were
refused, only a small percentage of
'aw applicants were turned away.
As a result 30 per cent of the law
graduates fail to pass the bar ex
amination while the number that
have had no law school or college
training bring the average of fail
ures up to 50 per cent.
Among the remedies urged to
overcome these conditions, the Bar
Association recommends that at
least two years' college study pre
paratory to law school work be re
quired and that only students grad
uating from approved schools be
allowed to take the examinations.
Only 13 states meet the former re
quirements while the Territory of
Hawaii is the sole jurisdiction meet
ing the latter.
Although the number of active
lawyers has been increased from
160,000 to 175,000 in the past three
years, the law school enrollments
have dropped 8,000 since 1930. Ar
bitrary limitation of the number enÂ«-
tering from the profession may re
sult if no other steps are taken to
limit entrants. Such limitations
could best be made through higher
standards of preparatory work.
