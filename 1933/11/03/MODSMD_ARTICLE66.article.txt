Formidable Kappa Sigma were the
losers yesterday afternoon when El
Toro intramural football men ad
vanced the ball into their opponents'
territory during an extra period. Fi
nal score, 15 to 13.
Jimmie Triolo, stellar wafer po
loist, successfully negotiated a
sleeper play on (he third scrimmage
of the game. A 30-yard pass to hini
was thrown by Marvie Kahn, who
also kicked the extra point.
Warren Braley, .speedy Kappa Sif, r
safety man who made several good
l unning gains in the game, carried
ihe ball 10 yards to their first score.
Sheldon Allen kicked goal. Shortly
afier, Braley again raced over Toro's
goal from the 12-yard line. The
kick by Allen was blocked by Bill
Morse. Half-time score was, Kappa
Sig.': 13, Toro 7.
An intercepted Kappa Sig pass
was run by Larry Lapidus 30 yards
to the Kappa Sig 15-yard lino in
(he second half. A Kahn to Lapi
dus pass scored, with Kahn's kick
;.fter the touchdown, under the
goal. A field goal attempted in the
last minute of play by Kahn failed.
With the score tied, the ball was
placed on the 50-yard line, with
each team taking it alternately.
Kappa Sigs advanced 12 yards into
Toro territory, but on the last Toro
play, a pass from Triolo was caught
one-handed by Kahn on the Kappa
Sig 39-yard marker. An incom
pleted pass marked the end of the
game by Kappa Sigs.
For the first time since intramural
football season opened, a feminine
audience consisting of two young
l;:dies, was present at the game.
Theta Chi walked through Encina
3E, 28 to 0, with John Slusser re
sponsible for three of the touch
downs, Bill Hoelle kicking the four
conversions. Slusser ran a punt 30
yards for the first score, caught a
20-yard pass for the second, and
took an intercepted pass over from
the 20-yard line. Les Roos blocked
an Encina punt, and Richard Van
Etten fell on the ball across the
goal for the fourth touchdown.
Theta Xi and Encina lIW played
a slow, evenly matched game, with
a 20-yard pass from Ralph Frates,
iun 30 yards by Kirke Allen for the
only Theta Xi touchdown. The con
version was successful, the final
.score being 7 to 0. Encina lIW
shewed good strength at times but
was not able to capitalize the power.
Once they were repulsed from scor
ing on the one-yard line.
Two passes, one for 50 yards and
the other for 30, from Jack Beach
to Robert Cockins, gave Phi Psi a
12 1o 0 advantage over the Menlo
Juniors.
Horse shoes are placed on the
goal posts at the Colorado School
of Mines, it is reported. The results
were quite satisfactory so the cus
tom is being continued. Perhaps if
someone would sneak into the Coli
seum at dawn Saturday after next,
perhaps . . . But U.S.C. might over
come the effects with four - leaf
clovers.
