# COAST TEAMS FACE EASY WEEK-END AS ONLY ONE CONFERENCE GAME IS BILLED
## 
### 
After two strenuous week-ends,
Pacific Coast teams face an easy
Saturday tomorrow with five squads
resting and only one Conference
game on the bill.
California's battle with U.C.L.A.
in Los Angeles is the only game
which will have any effect on Con
fcrence standings. The strong Bruin
defense built up by Bill Spaulding
may cause the Bears plenty of trou
ble and California will probably
need its first string most of the
game. U.C.L.A.'s weak offense tips
the scales well in Cal's favor.
Olympic Fracas
With the Olympic Club ready to
play its best game of the season,
Stanford will have plenty on its
hands. The addition of Hamilton
and a few line-up changes jnay be
what the Cards need to make them
go. A passing attack featuring such
Club players as Bill Doub, Jay Tod,
and "Hands"' Slavich, plus Thorn
hill's intention of using plenty of
lateral passes in the Indian offense,
should make the game a wide-open
fracas. Stanford won 6 to 0 last
year.
One of the stand-out games to
morrow will be the Santa Clara-Rice
affair at Kezar stadium. The Texas
team comes to San Francisco with
the reputation of being a great pass
ing outfit while the Broncos' So
brero is one of the best in the game
in that department.
Gaels Go East
The second pilgrimage of a Coast
team to the East this season takes
St. Mary's to New York to meet
Jimmy Crowley's Fordham Rams,
one of the few unbeaten, untied
teams left in the country. The great
punting of Captain Ed Danowski of

Fordham may be offset by the new
formations with which "Slip" Madi
gan is reputed to have equipped the
Gaels for this game, a clash of two
\ ariations of the Notre Dame sys
tem.
Oregon, present leader of the
Coast Conference with three victo
lies and no defeats, plays the peren
nial Rooky Mountain champions,
Utah, at Portland. The Utes have I
already fallen before one Coast team
this season, taking the count from
U.C.L.A. 21 to 0.
Cougars at Pullman
Washington State takes on Gon
zaga at Pullman in the remaining
game tomorrow. After two tough
battles against California and Ore
gon State on successive Saturdays,
the Cougars may not be in the best
condition for the Gonzaga tilt.
U.S.C., Washington, Oregon State,
Idaho, and Montana take the day
off tomorrow in preparation for im- J
pcrtant games next week.

With the Olympic Club ready to
play its best game of the season,
Stanford will have plenty on its
hands. The addition of Hamilton
and a few line-up changes jnay be
what the Cards need to make them
go. A passing attack featuring such
Club players as Bill Doub, Jay Tod,
and "Hands"' Slavich, plus Thorn
hill's intention of using plenty of
lateral passes in the Indian offense,
should make the game a wide-open
fracas. Stanford won 6 to 0 last
year.
One of the stand-out games to
morrow will be the Santa Clara-Rice
affair at Kezar stadium. The Texas
team comes to San Francisco with
the reputation of being a great pass
ing outfit while the Broncos' So
brero is one of the best in the game
in that department.
Gaels Go East
The second pilgrimage of a Coast
team to the East this season takes
St. Mary's to New York to meet
Jimmy Crowley's Fordham Rams,
one of the few unbeaten, untied
teams left in the country. The great
punting of Captain Ed Danowski of

Fordham may be offset by the new
formations with which "Slip" Madi
gan is reputed to have equipped the
Gaels for this game, a clash of two
\ ariations of the Notre Dame sys
tem.
Oregon, present leader of the
Coast Conference with three victo
lies and no defeats, plays the peren
nial Rooky Mountain champions,
Utah, at Portland. The Utes have I
already fallen before one Coast team
this season, taking the count from
U.C.L.A. 21 to 0.
Cougars at Pullman
Washington State takes on Gon
zaga at Pullman in the remaining
game tomorrow. After two tough
battles against California and Ore
gon State on successive Saturdays,
the Cougars may not be in the best
condition for the Gonzaga tilt.
U.S.C., Washington, Oregon State,
Idaho, and Montana take the day
off tomorrow in preparation for im- J
pcrtant games next week.
After two strenuous week-ends,
Pacific Coast teams face an easy
Saturday tomorrow with five squads
resting and only one Conference
game on the bill.
California's battle with U.C.L.A.
in Los Angeles is the only game
which will have any effect on Con
fcrence standings. The strong Bruin
defense built up by Bill Spaulding
may cause the Bears plenty of trou
ble and California will probably
need its first string most of the
game. U.C.L.A.'s weak offense tips
the scales well in Cal's favor.
