# MICHIGAN LEADING RACE FOR BIG TEN TOP PLACE
## 
### Russell C. Workman 
With the midway point in the
i Big Ten conference race reached,
! Michigan looms up stronger than
1 ever as the team to beat, with Pur
i due and Minnesota running in third
position.
The big game this week takes
j place at Urbana, Illinois, when the
i Michigan Wolverines face the fight -
i ing Illini. The Wolves have come
j along in great style, never having
; been seriously threatened in any
i contest. They haven't been beaten
J in over two years, and only one
! touchdown has been made against
them this season. They look like
j the class of the Mid-West.
Illinois has a squad that, won its
j only conference start when il
i whipped Wisconsin, 21 -0, three
, weeks ago. They will battle to the
; last whistle, led by Frank Fros
chauer and Les Lindberg, two stel
i lar backs, but Michigan's great run
! ning, passing, and kicking attack
j should win out.
j Coach Harry Kipke of Michigan
has instilled a lot of football into
| his men. Herman Everhardus of
j Michigan is leading the conference
j in scoring and he, with Captain Fay,
Westover, and Regeczi, form one of
the best backfields in the country.
The powerful, bone-crushing Min
nesota team, fresh from vanquish
ing lowa, invades the Wildcat
j stronghold. The famed Minnesota
j power attack has not been stopped
J this season, although the Gophers
| have been tied by Indiana and Pur
j due. Pug Lund, Gopher back, is
i one of the best triple threat backs
j in ihe Big Ten; Julius Alphonse also
j is a good Minnesota ground gainer.
Northwestern has been an in and
j out team thus far and may prove
j easy for Minnesota. However, the
| game is at Dyche stadium and
j Northwestern seldom loses at home.
Wisconsin meets Chicago in a
j game that will probably dccide the
i cellar champion. In three games

(Northwestern)

Wisconsin has scored only once
against Big Ten foes. Chicago has
not scored yet against a conference
team and the Chicago new deal
seems about washed up for the sea
son.
In the only other conference game,
Indiana meets Ohio State. The
Crimson team has had a couple of
weeks' rest and their injured backs
are well again, so it may be a close
fight. The giant Ohio State should
prove the determining factor.
lowa goes out of the conference
to take on lowa State. The lowans
have been all season and
should have little difficulty with the
downstaters. Dick Crayne provided
the only score against Minnesota
when he raced 50 yards with an
intercepted pass.
Purdue will meet Carnegie Tech
in its homecoming game. The Pur
due backfield, Pardpnner, Carter,
Purvis, and Hecker, has finally "hit
its stride; Chicago and Wisconsin
were defeated by 14-0 scores.
The once-mighty Irish of Notre
Dame will try to regain some of
their lost prestige against Navy at
Baltimore and should win this
game, but only after a hard
struggle.

Illinois has a squad that, won its
j only conference start when il
i whipped Wisconsin, 21 -0, three
, weeks ago. They will battle to the
; last whistle, led by Frank Fros
chauer and Les Lindberg, two stel
i lar backs, but Michigan's great run
! ning, passing, and kicking attack
j should win out.
j Coach Harry Kipke of Michigan
has instilled a lot of football into
| his men. Herman Everhardus of
j Michigan is leading the conference
j in scoring and he, with Captain Fay,
Westover, and Regeczi, form one of
the best backfields in the country.
The powerful, bone-crushing Min
nesota team, fresh from vanquish
ing lowa, invades the Wildcat
j stronghold. The famed Minnesota
j power attack has not been stopped
J this season, although the Gophers
| have been tied by Indiana and Pur
j due. Pug Lund, Gopher back, is
i one of the best triple threat backs
j in ihe Big Ten; Julius Alphonse also
j is a good Minnesota ground gainer.
Northwestern has been an in and
j out team thus far and may prove
j easy for Minnesota. However, the
| game is at Dyche stadium and
j Northwestern seldom loses at home.
Wisconsin meets Chicago in a
j game that will probably dccide the
i cellar champion. In three games

(Northwestern)

Wisconsin has scored only once
against Big Ten foes. Chicago has
not scored yet against a conference
team and the Chicago new deal
seems about washed up for the sea
son.
In the only other conference game,
Indiana meets Ohio State. The
Crimson team has had a couple of
weeks' rest and their injured backs
are well again, so it may be a close
fight. The giant Ohio State should
prove the determining factor.
lowa goes out of the conference
to take on lowa State. The lowans
have been all season and
should have little difficulty with the
downstaters. Dick Crayne provided
the only score against Minnesota
when he raced 50 yards with an
intercepted pass.
Purdue will meet Carnegie Tech
in its homecoming game. The Pur
due backfield, Pardpnner, Carter,
Purvis, and Hecker, has finally "hit
its stride; Chicago and Wisconsin
were defeated by 14-0 scores.
The once-mighty Irish of Notre
Dame will try to regain some of
their lost prestige against Navy at
Baltimore and should win this
game, but only after a hard
struggle.
With the midway point in the
i Big Ten conference race reached,
! Michigan looms up stronger than
1 ever as the team to beat, with Pur
i due and Minnesota running in third
position.
The big game this week takes
j place at Urbana, Illinois, when the
i Michigan Wolverines face the fight -
i ing Illini. The Wolves have come
j along in great style, never having
; been seriously threatened in any
i contest. They haven't been beaten
J in over two years, and only one
! touchdown has been made against
them this season. They look like
j the class of the Mid-West.
