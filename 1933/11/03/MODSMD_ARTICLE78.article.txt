# Thornhill Will Start 6 Sophomores Against O.C.
## CARDINALS UNDER COVER UNTIL S.C. GAME NEXT WEEK 
### 
Willi six sopTii-mores in his
starting line-up, Coach "Tiny"
Thornhill will attempt to lead his
hoys along the comeback trail
thai leads t«> U.S.C. tomorrow,
w hen Stanford meets the Olympic
Club. It will be the first game at
i home for Stanford in four weeks.
A complete sophomore backfield
will take the field against the Club.
Alustiza gets the starting call at
fullback, with Johnny Rcisner and
i Eob Hamilton at fullbacks and the
1 redoubtable Earl Hoos at quarter.
It is the first starting game for all
! these men excepting Hamilton, who
opened the U.C.L.A. game, played a
Jew minuter, and has since been out
I with a broken jaw.
It was announced yesterday that
Alustiza would probably be at quar
ter the remainder of the season but
| it was decided that time is too short
jfor him to become acquainted with
| his new duties this week.
Drown Starts
Red-haired Jack Drown, a fighter
j and a good one, will open the game
|at left tackle, playing opposite
| sophomore "Cab" Callaway at right
I tackle. Blanchard staris at center,
I beating Alf Brandin out of the start
| ing berth. Bill Bates has been taking
the heavy end of the center loael all
; season and is due for a rest, and Wes
j Muller is slightly handicapped with
la knee injury.
; O'Connor and Corbus are sched
-1 uled for the guard positions, with
i the possibility that both may give
way early in the game to Adams and
Rouble, a pair that have made fa
vorable impressions in the last two
| games. The regular combination of
' "Monk" Moscrip and A1 Norgard
| will hold down the ends.
The backfield quartet of Hamilton,
'■ Reisner, lloos, and Alustiza is fa
| vored by the bleacher coaches, who
I expect to see it go to town. There
; is a tremendous threat in Alustiza's
; quick kicks, and Hamilton demon
strated last night that he coulel boot
as well as anyone from the ortho-
I dox punt formation.
Earl Hoos is an excellent blocker,
good on defense, and is a daring sig
| nal caller who sticks to no stero
! typed formulae. And Reisner, who
will play left half where the burden
•>f ball carrying falls heavily, is a
I specialist in twists and swerves, po
tentially able to go for touchdowns
| at any odd moment.
Test for Hamilton
I The best thing about this lad
I Hamilton is his name, although a lot
iof observers allow that he is tops,
| when it comes to holding down a
I half in ideal fashion. He will be a
cynosure tomorrow, with everyone
I waiting to see if that flash of power
| he displayed in the Bruin, game was
i tne real McCoy, or false alarm.
So far, most everyone nas been
; dumping O.C. with distressing reg
[ ularity, but that will not prevent
! them from dealing plenty of misery
j tomorrow. Because Thornhill must
: keep tho Cardinals well under cover,
j with the probability that no one will
j see any of the fancy stuff (you
; know Ctin Herd is likely to drop in
| any one of these Saturday after-
I noons), the Club has a chance to
j put on a spurt and catch Stanford
I in a weak moment.
j With a pair of former Stanford
I ends, Jay Tod and Bill Doub, on tap,
i as well as Hands Slavich and Russ
j Sporswood of Santa Clara, the
! Olympic Club has the best wingmen
I on the Coast.
