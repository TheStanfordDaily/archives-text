# CARD WATER POLO TEAM NOSES OUT ATHENS CLUB IN HARD TILT
## 
### Gray Creveling 
Confident Stanford varsity water'
polo players got a real scare Wed
nesday night when they had all they
cculd do to nose out the Athens
Club 7-6 at Gakianu.
In stopping Athens' first try for a
goal, Leo Cook pulled a muscle in
his left leg, was left powerless to
stop two more throws which whizzed :
by him as he could not move to
reach the ball. With the score Ath
ens 2, Stanford 0, Kenny Livingston

replaced helpless Cook. Athens
scored again, and it looked like the
Cards were going down under the
dub's merciless attack.
Card Attack Begins
I Finally Vlad Taranik and Jim Tri
olo got under way and the score
was evened. Athens' Jim Mackey
got in the clear and put in another
to leave Stanford one goal behind
at half time.
With "You can take these guys. I
C'mon, show 'em you're real*chain- '
pions," Indian Coach Nort Thorn
ton urged the team to sett,l2 down
ifcr the remainder of the game, and
they did!
Triolo began getting the ball from
sprint and the Stanford plays,
clicked. Two goals put the Cards'
in front. The clubmen retaliated ;
with one to tie things up again. An- i
other play worked to score lor Stan- ;
ford, but the club immediately
•matched it, and it took a long, beau-

tiful shot in the last minute to put
Thornton's paddlers out in front,
Stanforel kept the club bottled up
and the game ended as the Indians
were about to shoot again.
Brilliant Team Play
Each team member played bril
l'antly in the second half. Captain
Gordy Graves and high point man
Taranik had their hands full, but
outmatched their men. Wally Wiget
and Bill Woodard alternated to con
tribute good games at center back.
Bend and Triolo really came to life
in the second half to outplay their
men. Other forwards Foster and
McDowell alternateel and playeel
good water polo.
Quivering Kenny Livingston
proved to be an excellent goalie, as
time and again he stoppeel thrusts.
Livingston had also played goalie for
Stanford's junior varsity during
most of their game. "Iron Man" Liv
ingston will be the best apprentice
that veteran Leo Cook will ever
have.
Cord juniors romped through
Athens Club juniors 8-3. Dean high
pointed with three, Charlie Danforth
scored twice, Schmidt and Clumeck
swam circles around their oppon
ents.
To secure a date with a coeel at
Pcnn State College back in 1870, the
peimission of the president and the
dean of women was needed.

Confident Stanford varsity water'
polo players got a real scare Wed
nesday night when they had all they
cculd do to nose out the Athens
Club 7-6 at Gakianu.
In stopping Athens' first try for a
goal, Leo Cook pulled a muscle in
his left leg, was left powerless to
stop two more throws which whizzed :
by him as he could not move to
reach the ball. With the score Ath
ens 2, Stanford 0, Kenny Livingston

replaced helpless Cook. Athens
scored again, and it looked like the
Cards were going down under the
dub's merciless attack.
Card Attack Begins
I Finally Vlad Taranik and Jim Tri
olo got under way and the score
was evened. Athens' Jim Mackey
got in the clear and put in another
to leave Stanford one goal behind
at half time.
With "You can take these guys. I
C'mon, show 'em you're real*chain- '
pions," Indian Coach Nort Thorn
ton urged the team to sett,l2 down
ifcr the remainder of the game, and
they did!
Triolo began getting the ball from
sprint and the Stanford plays,
clicked. Two goals put the Cards'
in front. The clubmen retaliated ;
with one to tie things up again. An- i
other play worked to score lor Stan- ;
ford, but the club immediately
•matched it, and it took a long, beau-

tiful shot in the last minute to put
Thornton's paddlers out in front,
Stanforel kept the club bottled up
and the game ended as the Indians
were about to shoot again.
Brilliant Team Play
Each team member played bril
l'antly in the second half. Captain
Gordy Graves and high point man
Taranik had their hands full, but
outmatched their men. Wally Wiget
and Bill Woodard alternated to con
tribute good games at center back.
Bend and Triolo really came to life
in the second half to outplay their
men. Other forwards Foster and
McDowell alternateel and playeel
good water polo.
