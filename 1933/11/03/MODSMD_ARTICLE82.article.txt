# INJURIES HANDICAP FROSH GRIDMEN IN GAME TOMORROW
## 
### 
Still handicapped by a collection
of injuries that will last up to and
including next week's Little Big
Game, Stanford's frosli gridmen will
face the first-year team from San
Jose State College here tomorrow
in a preliminary to the varsity game
with the Olympic Club. The year
ling contest is scheduled to begin
at 11:30 o'clock.
Dealing a blow to freshman
chances against California next
week is the news that Mel Hurley
and, Fred Williams, two outstand
ing yearling players, will be out for
the balance of the season with in
juries. Alternating between guard
and tackle, Hurley, a big 200-
pounder, has been a valuable mem
ber of the Babes' exceptionally
powerful line.
Backfield Reserves
Fred Williams, ace drop-kicker,
passer, and ball - carrier, probably
the lastest man on the team, will be
most seriously missed, since good
freshman backfield reserves are
conspicuous by their absence this
year. Although working out daily.
Captain Dale Beedle and Joe Vigna,
first-string tackle and halfback re
spectively, will see no action until
the California fracas next week.
Both are recovering from injuries
received in recent games.
Big, red-headed Jack Walton, a
guard until recently, has been shift
ed to the left hall-back post where
his defensive ability is expected to
help offset the scoring punch that
will be missed with Williams out
of the game. Continuing his one
man monopoly of the position, Fusty
Ledbctter, another behemothic car
rot-top, will hold down the full
back job.
Second Siring Lineup
Completing the backfield combi
nation for tomorrow's game will be
long-punting Grigo Turretto at right
half while Tom Lanphier will be
given a chance to see what he can
do with the quarterback job.
Giving his regulais a rest, Coach
Bradshaw will start Corner and
Taylor at tackles tomorrow, Geisen
and Pinnell at guards, while Berg
man, who alternates with Quails on
the first string, will piay at center.
Jenkins will start at one end, while
no choice for the other wing post
has yei been made, with Bradshaw
hoping to give Walt Chouteau, regu
lar right end, a rest until next
week.
