# Field Wet for Track Events
## 
### 
If practice makes perfect, marks
t in this afternoon's intersquad track '
and field tangle will be little or no
better than those of last week.
Rain and poor track take the
blame. Weather conditions prohi
bited any thought of workouts Mon
day, and track condition prevented
. practice Tuesday. So Wednesday
! and Thursday, when Coach Dink
Tsmpleton's Indian athletes usually i
taper off and content themselves (
with mere limbering up, were the |
1 only workout periods.
With official approval of the
B.A.C. as the only delay, a cross
country run between Stanford and
California is almost certain to take i
I place on the Cardinal golf course on
t he- morning of the Big Game.
In preparation, Indian distance
men have been drilling for the
' gruelling four-mile grind. Temple- -
ton has named Norman Bright, star
miler, as captain of the Stanforel
team. The mentor said the first five
Stanford men to finish probably will
receive circle awards. There is no
] limit on the number of entries.
There is something more danger
ous than bucking horses and wild
steers, says Superintendent Shaw
of Colorado Springs school. Foot
ball. Result: The gridiron has been
exchanged for the "gentle" rodeo
field .
