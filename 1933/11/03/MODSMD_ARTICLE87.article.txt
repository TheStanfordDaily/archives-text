# POLOISTS MEET DEL MONTE MEN
## 
### 
Playing their second game of the
fall season, Captain Gordan's Stan
ford poloists will meet a quartet
from the Del Monte Polo Club this
| afternoon on the campus Highway
field. The contest will begin at 3
o'clock.
j A slight shift in the Stanford
lineup finds Kemp Macr, veteran
| member of last year's squad, get
ting the call over Frank Burns at
the number two position. Burns will
see action later in the game, how
ever, probably going in at uie half.
I Luppe Luppen, hard-riding and
long - driving forward, will start

again at number one. Woody Mo
lone, who teamed with Luppen on
last year's quartet, will hold down
the number ihw>e position while
Bill Rogers, trick-riding exponent
and experienced poloist, will play at
back.
Del Monte's starting lineup will
find Jordan at number one, Ray at,
two, Collins ai three, and Drum
mond at back. What sort of opposi
tion this quartet can give to the
Stanford riders is not known, little
information being available about
the visitors.
Both teams have had games with
the Menlo Circus Club, however.
Last Friday the Indians had a com
paratively easy time in humbling
Menlo 7 to 1, while Del Monte
bowed to the Circus Club 5 to 2. It
is quite likely, however, that a
different group of players repre
sented Menlo against Del Monte. In
any case, the visitors are expected
Over 200 students at the Univer
sity of Michigan u:-e airplanes as a
means of transportation to and from
home over the holidays.

Orchesis will take place next Wed
