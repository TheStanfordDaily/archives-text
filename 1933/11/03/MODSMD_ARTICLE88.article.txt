# BIG ENROLLMENT IN WOMEN'S GYM
## 
### 
The rapidly-forming habit of
blaming everything on tht_* influx of
new women might well be applied
to the surprising transformation in
the women's athletic department.
Foi midable-looking trucks bearing
T.l new lockers in front of the
Women's Gym may be accredited to
doubling of the women taking
| gymnasium from 297 in autumn
quarter of last year to the present
.enrollment of 531.
This great increase has necessi
! tated the opening of new offices and
|the addition of new people to the
staff. Five new members have been
i Â£ ppointed, who are: Dr. Elizabeth
j Whitney, consulting psychologist and
mental hygienist; Dr. Ethel Shaull,
assisting Dr. Dyment in the greatly
I increased number of medical con
| ferences; Miss Isabel Dearborn, as
sistant secretary; Miss Grace King,
taking Miss Bunting's place on the
I staff; and Misses Miriam Rease and
! Margaret Barr, serving part time to
j take care of the great overflow in
the classes.
