# Streamlined Motorcycle Is Engineering Project
## 
### 
A completely streamlined motor
cycle is the aim of Edward West's
aerodynamics project under Everett
Lesley, professor of mechanical en
gineering. Experience with motor
cycle racing on Dry Lake suggested
needed improvements.
At present a three-foot wind tun
nel model is being constructed of
redwood. Striking features of the
fish-like vehicle are a large fixed
rudder, and concealed handle-bars.
Except for four-inch projections of
the wheels, the driver as well as
all the parts is covered by stream
lined fusilage. A 20 per cent in
crease in maximum speed plus ad
ditional economy is anticipated.
