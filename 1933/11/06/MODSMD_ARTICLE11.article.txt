# Shaw Play Laurels Go To Peckham
## 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
Friday night's production of
"Arms and the Man" did a number
of things: primarily, it delighted the
audience — the largest in several
years; secondarily, it made money—
"no mean feat in these days. Artis
tically, it nominated John Peckham
for new heights, gave Mary Anita
Loos her best role, discovered Jean
Albertson, re-discovered Waldo Salt,
and—by no manner of means least—
demonstrated that Harold Helven
ston is a director-designer of no
small talent.

Helvenston's direction was calcu
lated to bring out the satire of the
Bernard Shaw play, and it brought
out also the abilities of the leading
players. But it was for the settings
that the laurels were bestowed on
Helvenston Friday night. All three
sets were excellent, but the second
act, depicting the gay garden of the
Petkoff home, was a delight to be
hold—the most attractive picture
seen on the Stanford stage in a long,
long time.
Peckhani Dominates
Completely dominating Act I and
successfully holding his own in the
later action, John Peckham was the
hero of the evening. Poise, charm,
and facility of voice made his Cap
tain Bluntschli a memorable char
acterization. His audacious entrance
gave way to simulation of sheer ex
haustion with the finesse of the con
summate actor.
Greatly improved in poise, Mary
Anita Loos made the most of the
negligible role of the heroine, espe
cially in the matter of comedy. She
was pictorially extremely effective,
and after an uncertain first act, her
voice was better than ever before.
Subtlety Fits Albcrtson
Jean Albertson, with excellent
command of voice and gesture,
achieved a charming and subtly
shaded interpretation of Louka. Her
rare ability to mingle comedy with
drama makes her a highly promis
ing find, and her "If I were em-
pi ess of Russia" speech was one of 1
(he most compelling moments of the ;
piece.
The unctuous Nikola was delight- j
fully played by that old scene- i
stealer, Waldo Salt, whose comedy j
was a pleasure to laugh at, and i
whose ease was a pleasure to be
hold.

maximum of comedy which she

Sergius was the object of most of I
Shaw's satire, and consequently a I
difficult assignment, and George

convincing interpretation.
George Fuller's best bit was his j
flourishing curtain call gesture, and. i
he was adequate as the Russian of- j
ficer.

Friday night's production of
"Arms and the Man" did a number
of things: primarily, it delighted the
audience — the largest in several
years; secondarily, it made money—
"no mean feat in these days. Artis
tically, it nominated John Peckham
for new heights, gave Mary Anita
Loos her best role, discovered Jean
Albertson, re-discovered Waldo Salt,
and—by no manner of means least—
demonstrated that Harold Helven
ston is a director-designer of no
small talent.

Helvenston's direction was calcu
lated to bring out the satire of the
Bernard Shaw play, and it brought
out also the abilities of the leading
players. But it was for the settings
that the laurels were bestowed on
Helvenston Friday night. All three
sets were excellent, but the second
act, depicting the gay garden of the
Petkoff home, was a delight to be
hold—the most attractive picture
seen on the Stanford stage in a long,
long time.
Peckhani Dominates
Completely dominating Act I and
successfully holding his own in the
later action, John Peckham was the
hero of the evening. Poise, charm,
and facility of voice made his Cap
tain Bluntschli a memorable char
acterization. His audacious entrance
gave way to simulation of sheer ex
haustion with the finesse of the con
summate actor.
Greatly improved in poise, Mary
Anita Loos made the most of the
negligible role of the heroine, espe
cially in the matter of comedy. She
was pictorially extremely effective,
and after an uncertain first act, her
voice was better than ever before.
