# Quad Appeals to Senior Loyalty in Sales Drive
## 
### 
Conspicuous by its absence, Stan
ford's much-published senior class
loyalty will be the subject of appeal
in a Quad sales drive from 8 to 12
o'clock this morning at Engineering
corner.
Although sales progress in most
classes, seniors show a surprising in
difference, says Manager Whitfield.
Regular Quads sell today for $5.65,
senior volumes for $6.65 plus the
picture. Addition of name on cover
boosts the price 50 cents.
Announcement of a bargain price
of $1 instead of last year's $2 for
ihe graduate photograph is expected
to attract further purchasers, since
senior sales to date are quoted be
low the customary number.
With the entrance of the "800"
and introduction of new campus ac
tivities, the '34 Quad should be ex
ceptionally popular, editors agree.
