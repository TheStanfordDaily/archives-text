## Yaple, Shibley Leaders In Verbal Combat Over Booze Question 
### 
Liquor on the campus, beer in the
Union; or, existence in the midst
of arid Palo Alto region with alco
hol-loving Stanfordites seeking in
vain for thirst-quenching liquid,

tellectually minded, right-enforcing
students will tear hair and pound
the table tonight. Occasion: second
meeting of newly-formed Public Fo
rum in Room 202, English Building,
8:15 o'clock.

degree than at the first organizing
gathering, self-expressing men and

bally combat "Resolved, That This

High tension debate, smoothly
orated discourse, even quietly ex
pressed opinions will be in vogue.

the negative response will be tall,
tawny, George Shibley. Upholding
the candle for abstaining, self-con
j trolling tradition-keepers of the af
firmative side will be blonde Max
ine Yaple.
