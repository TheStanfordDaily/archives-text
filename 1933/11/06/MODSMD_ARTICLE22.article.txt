If you want a date in a hurry, try j
the Thetasâ€”they're quicker to an

Theta Delts u#o won a telephone
survey conducted between 5 and 5:30 |
o'clock Friday with the record time
of an answer in five seconds. The 1
Thetas placed second with six sec
onds.
Leaden-footed Theta C'liis am
bled to the telephone in 37 sec
onds, with D.G.'s trailing the
sorority list with 27. In the speed
classification the Kappas, Sigma
Chis, Sigma Nus, Gamma Phis.
Pi Phis, and Kappa Alphas all had
records of eight seconds or better.
Beta Theta Pi, winners of a simi- |
la; 1 poll at Oregon State, managed
but a poor 23 seconds at Stanford. |
Kappas, winners in the sorority class
iti the North, defeated their Stan
lord sisters by half a second. Gam- ,

ma Phis, slowest Oregon sorority to
the phone, were shamed by the local
chapter, which answered in eight
seconds.
Sororities, date-hopeful maybe,
did well in the local canvass, aver

houses had lifted the receiver. Re
markable tenacity was shown by
some answerers, one gentleman at
Phi Kappa Sigma persisting for two

with a foul epithet (censored).
More amusing was the Pi Phi who
commenced her answers in the
sugary tone typical of sororities, be
came louder and less polite as time
went by, and concluded "For good
ness' sake."
