# EXECUTIVE BODY TO DETERMINE FATE OF 'JAMARINO AT MEET
## Statements Reveal Farm Leaders Favor Old Encina Tradition 
### 
Asked their opinions of the per
petuation of the freshman Pajania
rino, members of the A.S.S.U.
Executive Committee answered as
follows yesterday.
Jerry Trautman, A.S.S.U. presi
dent: "I think a Pajamarino should
be held. It is possible to so regulate
it that the defects of last year will
not reappear. The Ex Committee
will probably grant this Thursday
night for the Pajamarino."
Chuck Otis: "If the freshmen are
careful there is no harm in the Pa
jamarino. Because so many tradi
tions have been taken away from
the frosh in particular and Stanford
in general, the Pajamarino should
be kept."
Mary Lyons: "I see no conceivable
reason why the freshmen should not
be allowed their Pajamarino pro
vided only that proper precautions
are taken to insure against the de
struction of property in Roble and
Palo Alto. Many traditions are
going; this one, if correctly handled,
is harmless and enjoyable."
Bruce Tarver: "I will always re
member the fun we had as fresh
men when we put on our Pajama
rino. Some Stanford traditions must
go and have gone; the Pajamarino
is one that should remain and I hope
will remain."
Mary Louise Stewart: "The Pa
jamarino is an excellent tradition
that should be perpetuated provid
ing only that the freshmen do not
disturb the sanctity and safety of
Roble Hall by demolishing property
and disturbing the women."
Wally Brooke: "I am in favor of
the Pajamarino and the freshmen I
have spoken to on the subject seem
to feel distinctly the same way. The
Pajamarino has always been fun and
it should be continued."
Jim Triolo: "I think if the proper
precautions against the invasion of
Roble are taken, the Pajamarino
should be had as usual. It is custo
mary; and aids in solidifying the
freshman class."
Johnny Mottram: "I do not see any
good reason for not keeping the Pa
jamarino. It is one of the mainstays
i of frosh spirit."
Bud Godfrey and Miriam Kropp
stated they would rather make no
comments.
