# "GET WISE" PARTY
## 
### 
University of Oregon uses a "get
wise" party to acquaint students
with campus life. About 100 women
perform in skits about publications,
lobbies and sports, manners and
clothes. This year a "television
idea" was the theme.
A modern stream-lined auto is
being built on the Stanford campus.
