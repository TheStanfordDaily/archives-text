# Nevada Coeds Sell Dime Bricks for Building Fund
## 
### 
Bricks at 10 cents a throw are,
being sold by frosh women of the
University of Nevada to raise funds
for a future student union building.
In reality, bricks are not being
exchanged for the dime, but "brick
tags" are given those who contribute
to the building fund. Women co
operating in the sale in a big way
will be recommended for member
ship in the campus women's pep
organization. Those who don't are
reported to the Women's Upperclass
Committee.
