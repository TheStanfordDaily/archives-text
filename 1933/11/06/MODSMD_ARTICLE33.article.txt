Doomed to necessary destroy a i or
hilarious continuation, the freshman
Pajamarino will be both plaintiff
I and defendant in the famous '"Tra
dition vs. Expediency" case to be
appealed to the Executive Commit
j tee at 7:o0 o'clock tomorrow night.
Common law prcccdcnt points
! the unquavering finder of histori
cal justice to a continuation of the
Pajamarino. Traditionally screwy,
the annual freshman gay-clad
march down Row and up Rohlc
rests its defense on the sponta
neous enjoyment of past similar
marches.
The prosecution's case rests upon
Mho exigencies of the moment,
j Granting that the Pajamarino is both
I fine and fun, its opponents wish to
prevent costly unnecessary destroy a 1
of property. If it. is found that a
j harmless Pajamarino can be organi
sed, the Ex Committee will grant
| official permission for same; if the
; jury of ten reasonable members of
! the Stanford community finds that
the sanctity of Roble will be dis
! turbed, that Roble furniture and
| Palo Alto theatres will, be dcmol
j ished, then no date will be allowed
| the freshmen.
Complications Arise
The situation became fraught v/ith
complications because the freshmen
neglected to request a date from the
lEx Committee for their march and
| because last year's Pajamarino re
( suited in the destruction of property
that A.S.S.U. funds had to replace,
j Wednesday night, the evening cho
sen by the frosh, is officially impos
! sible because Roble and Encina
j sponsors will be sojourning at the
! Wilbur mansion, thus leaving the
, marchers unorganized, the maidens
] unprotected. A Pajamarino result
j ing in the expensive reproduction of
i demolished curtains and signs and
j chairs from two .theatres, and in the
• storming of the Roble Bastille
! through windows and keyholes is
| impossible because .... Well, it's
! impossible.
