A Texas university will not present "Uncle Tom's Cab
in" (the dramatic saga of Topsy and Eva), because Hie
Daughters of the (Confederacy rendered strenuous objec
tions. Why Ihev objected the dispatch does not state—but
no doubt they feared another (Civil War, Harriet Stowe's
play being grandiloquently credited with precipitating the
first. In reality, of course, they feared having the ideas for
which their men died taking the bird.
The Daughters of the (Confederacy are no doubt fine
ladies, probably make line corn fritters and fine fried
chicken. Fine General Lee on his fine white horse has al
ways been a fine boyhood memory. Hut the Daughters'
excessive thin-skinncdncss is nothing short of phenomenal,
[low Ihev can object to criticism of an issue, slavery, that
has been chronicled dead since 1865, is most startling.
iiut groups 011 the outside of college are that way
startlingly touchy. Write that Ericson the Red discovered
America and Italy is up in arms. Advocate (Columbus as
the discoverer and Scandinavia mobilizes. Intimate that
George Washington had false teeth; the D.A.R. begins
seething with rage. Suggest that he didn't; and the Ameri
can Dental Association is moved to intense wrath.
At college, however, everyone takes the bird and enjoys
it; or at least pretends to. May the good God protect the
sensitive sou! at college, lie is beaten into the corner.
Roobed drama stars, criticized line plungers, censured
politicians all at college smile, bum cigarettes, and act
nonchalant.
And now someone will write a (Campus Opinion un
loosing a veritable avalanche of words staling that the
Daily, besides trying to ruin the University, is generally
horrible, subversive, and lousy. The Editor will have to
print it; thank the person who wrote it; and hide his cha
grin in a cherry coke.
