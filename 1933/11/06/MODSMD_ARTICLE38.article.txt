# On with the Pajamerino
## 
### 
If is very likely lliat the world will not stop its turning j
if (lie Pajamerino is killed. In fact, there are very good j
chances that il will keep on going. But that is not the point, j
The point is that the Pajamerino is some swell fun. The
Daily is strictly against any "tradition" that has to be
hallyhooed into activity, principally because it is against f
ballyhoo; but also because hallyhooed traditions usually j
lizzie most miserably. And nothing looks sadder than a
fizzled tradition.
Hut the Frosh seem to want the Pajamerino. They i
probably wouldn't be lurmal if they didn't. There are only ,
two dangers to having il.
First danger: last \ear extra-exuberant frosh were not j
content with singing to Roble. They carried their song J
through the windows and into the corridors in person. '
Now, mothers do not send their daughters to Stanford to
have pajamacd freshni mi come trouping through the
rooms. They probably do not send them to listen to the
frosh "serenade"; but that is one "evil" that must be tol
eraled none the less. If there are to be Pajamerinos in the
future, it is up to this year's class to confine their cxuber- '
ance to Roble steps, avoid breaking in through windows, j
Second danger: accidents at the Palo Alto theatres.
Mad running on what will be spring quarter oat fields is
OK, hurts nothing but oat plant embryos. Rut when the J
running shifts to Palo Alto, it must be remembered that
Palo Alto citizens are more easily hurt than the oat em- j
bryos and must he more carefully treated.
The Kx Committee should and probably will vote to
have the Pajamerino. The duty is with the freshmen to !
be reasonable in their excitement in order that next year's
class mav be able to have the same fun.
