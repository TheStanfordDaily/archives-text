The thing thai omniscient Arthur Brisbane said would j
never he, is to become a reality: legalized liquor will soon i
(low even faster than milk and honey throughout this fair j
html. II will not (low legally on the campus. That sad fact
is well known.
Hut it still makes interesting talk. It will he informally j
debated at the second Student Forum tonight in the Eng-1
lish building, in Room 202.
The wind of freedom blows even though the freedom
of liquor does not flow. Students can come to this meeting, !
express themselves on why or why not Stanford should i
remain the drop of dry sand in an ocean of rum. After the
meeting, wets can go down or up the highway, put their
convictions into acts. Drys can go a shorter distance to
the I nion, and have a coke; if it is cold, a nice stimulating !
cup of coffee.
II may be said that the students never make any mate- i
rial changes in (his I'niversity. That is an unpleasant real- j
iiy. Hut at least il is pleasant to know that the Adminis- !
tration doesn't care particularly what the students discuss
in their meetings. That just about makes things even, at a j
one-to-one standstill, for the average student does not care
what the Administration discusses at ils meetings.
The discussion tonight should prove highly enter-1
tinning, even though il will accomplish nothing unfor- s
Innately.
The Daily stall meets today at 1: 15 o'clock.
