SAMSON IIT DAMLA
(Saint-Saens)
War Memorial Opera House
The music of this work is as be
nign, unexciting, and second-rate as
everything else Saint-Saens ever
wrote, but it does provide opportu
nity for effective staging and some
pleasant choruses, plus an entire
second act filled with mild and
pretty tunes, with loud enough pas
sion to lift them to an emotionally
thrilling level. But this saving grace
was deficient Friday night, so that
the performance was as unclimatic
as a minuet by Ethelbert Nevin, and
the most demonstrative applause
saved for the ballet in the last act.
Cyrena Van Gordon in the role of
Dalila proved an inauspicious mezzo,
with a muffled middle range and lit
tle volume. Her first aria she whis
pered unsteadily, and it was not un
ti' the familiar "Mon coeur s'ouvre
a ta voir" that her voice found a
husky security.
Giovanni Martineili, returning af
ler two years, showed an amazing
decline in singing ability; his voice
was tight, strained, thin, and often
oft' pitch. Only his "Vois ma misere"
solo scene in the last act had musi
cal or dramatic quality.
The best work of the evening was
done by Ezio Pinza and by the
chorus. The always reliable Pinza
fitted his rich, sensitive bass into a
dignified characterization of the High
Priest, and the chorus sang with
fine tone and co-ordination. The
success of the ballet augurs well for
Ihe staging of "Le Coq D'Or," for
Adolph Bolm conceived and exe
cuted a varied bacchanale to the
very familiar music with a dynamic
quality which the rest of the per
formance lacked.
The capabilities of both chorus
and ballet and the inadequacies of
the star singers are a complete re
versal of previous methods, and we
may only hope that before the end
cf the season a balance may be
achieved. —Broughton
THE CRITIC (Sheridan)
Palo Alto Community Theater
After more than 150 years, the
satire and brilliant wit of this Sheri
dan comedy is still able to stand
beside the best travesties of our own
day. This fact was indisputably
demonstrated by James Sandoe's
production for the P.A.C.T. last
Thursday.
Too much credit for the evening's

.success cannot be given Sandoe,
whose direction combined a thor
ough understanding of modern
comic possibilities with an evident
j appreciation of the eighteenth cen
tury spirit. More specifically, the
settings and effects, the numerous
j periodic incidents, and the various
[characters were deftly synchronized
j into a highly effective whole.
The worst criticism that could be
levelled at the production concerns
the alterations in dialogue, which
were carried beyond the point ne
i cessary to "bring the script up to
date" (if that had been deemed
necessary). It would seem that
Sheridan could stand on his own
feet, without the aid of the delecta
ble Mae West or the oft-imitated
i Time magazine.
Outstanding in widely differing
roles were Robert Brauns, Robert
Balzer, and Marian Jones.
Brauns' role of Mr. Puff was by
i far the most difficult, and he han
dled his part with brilliant distinc
tion, successfully co-ordinating the
| somewhat disorganized action of the
| play, and achieving a subtly satiric
chai acterization of the forerunner
of the modern press-agent.
Balzer was the surprise of the
■ evening: his Sir Fretful Plagiary
was simply delightful; he built his
comedy without overplaying it, and
he quite .stole the first act.
Miss Jones displayed a remarkable
flail for burlesque, particularly in
her "mad scene," successfully resist
ing a temptation to exaggerate.
1 Skillful use of voice and gesture
j marked her work as Tilburina, he
roine of the "tragedy rehears'd."
; James Broughton, particularly in
his use of gesture, showed a thor
ough understanding of the character
;or Mr. Dangle, and Myna Hughes
was able as his wife. Curt Ziman
sky, though well cast, was still Curt
Zimansky.
All the other playex-s, notably An
jdrews Harris, George Wilson, and
Dick Dawson, were extremely ca
pable, ably catching the spirit of
Shis hilarious Sheridan travesty.
