# YEARLING GRIDMEN DEFEAT SAN JOSE IN 14-6 COMEBACK
## 
### Charles Chappell 
Running into stiller opposition
than they had bargained for, Stan
lord's frosh gridmen, behind 0 to 0
at the half, staged a strong come
back last Saturday to defeat the San
Jose State yearlings by a not-too
impressive 14-6 score.
With a number of regulars gracing
the sidelines, either permanently be
cause of injuries or temporarily in
order to rest up for the coming Little
Big Game, the Babes had a fairly
.strenuous afternoon of it before fi
nally coming out on the long end ol
the score.
Intercept Pass
In a hole from the start as the
l fcsult of a short kickoff, Stanford
intercepted a pass and then ex
changed punts with San Jose, com
ing into possession of the ball on
their own 13-yard line. An unlucky
Indian fumble then gave San Jose
possession of the ball on Stanford's
5-yard line, from which Peach
pushed it over in one play for the
visitors. The conversion failed.
Just as the first quarter ended,
Couch Bradshaw's men turned the
tables on the Staters by pouncing
on a fumble on the San Jose 28.
A long run then landed the oval on
the visitors' 3-yard line, bui. a strong
goal-line defense staved off the In
dians for four consecutive downs.
After the punt out, a series of
passes kept Stanford knocking at the
touchdown door but nothing more
tangible than a goose egg graced
the scoreboard at halftime.
Schott Scores Touchdown
Opening the second half, Stanford
immediately proceeded to redeem
itself by blocking a San Jose punt
which Carl Schott, alert Indian
wingman, scooped up and carried 20
yards to a touchdown. After scor
ing the six points, Schott took it
upon himself to add another by
booting the ball through the posts
for the conversion.
Beginning the fourth quarter, |
Louie Tsoutsouvas, chunky Stanford j
tackle, recovered a San Jose fumble
in midfieid. A play and a penalty
then landed the ball on the visitors'
24-yard line. From here A1 Brent,
."•peedy Indian half, broke loose and
streaked down the sidelines to an
other score. Schott again converted.
Fourth Win of Season
Saturday's victory was the first
that the Stanford frosh have won in
their last four starts, making their
fourth of the season. Three weeks
ago a close 6 to 3 contest was
dropped to S.C., while Menlo and the
Santa Clara frosh turned the trick
in the last two games. Early victo
ries were gained at the expense of
San Mateo and Modesto Jaysees and
the Armstrong Business College.
Next Saturday the Babes will meet
the California frosh in the annual'
Little Big Game on the Stanford
campus.

on a fumble on the San Jose 28.
A long run then landed the oval on
the visitors' 3-yard line, bui. a strong
goal-line defense staved off the In
dians for four consecutive downs.
After the punt out, a series of
passes kept Stanford knocking at the
touchdown door but nothing more
tangible than a goose egg graced
the scoreboard at halftime.
Schott Scores Touchdown
Opening the second half, Stanford
immediately proceeded to redeem
itself by blocking a San Jose punt
which Carl Schott, alert Indian
wingman, scooped up and carried 20
yards to a touchdown. After scor
ing the six points, Schott took it
upon himself to add another by
booting the ball through the posts
for the conversion.
Beginning the fourth quarter, |
Louie Tsoutsouvas, chunky Stanford j
tackle, recovered a San Jose fumble
in midfieid. A play and a penalty
then landed the ball on the visitors'
24-yard line. From here A1 Brent,
."•peedy Indian half, broke loose and
streaked down the sidelines to an
other score. Schott again converted.
Fourth Win of Season
Saturday's victory was the first
that the Stanford frosh have won in
their last four starts, making their
fourth of the season. Three weeks
ago a close 6 to 3 contest was
dropped to S.C., while Menlo and the
Santa Clara frosh turned the trick
in the last two games. Early victo
ries were gained at the expense of
San Mateo and Modesto Jaysees and
the Armstrong Business College.
Next Saturday the Babes will meet
the California frosh in the annual'
Little Big Game on the Stanford
campus.
Running into stiller opposition
than they had bargained for, Stan
lord's frosh gridmen, behind 0 to 0
at the half, staged a strong come
back last Saturday to defeat the San
Jose State yearlings by a not-too
impressive 14-6 score.
With a number of regulars gracing
the sidelines, either permanently be
cause of injuries or temporarily in
order to rest up for the coming Little
Big Game, the Babes had a fairly
.strenuous afternoon of it before fi
nally coming out on the long end ol
the score.
Intercept Pass
In a hole from the start as the
l fcsult of a short kickoff, Stanford
intercepted a pass and then ex
changed punts with San Jose, com
ing into possession of the ball on
their own 13-yard line. An unlucky
Indian fumble then gave San Jose
possession of the ball on Stanford's
5-yard line, from which Peach
pushed it over in one play for the
visitors. The conversion failed.
Just as the first quarter ended,
Couch Bradshaw's men turned the
tables on the Staters by pouncing
on a fumble on the San Jose 28.
A long run then landed the oval on
the visitors' 3-yard line, bui. a strong
goal-line defense staved off the In
dians for four consecutive downs.
