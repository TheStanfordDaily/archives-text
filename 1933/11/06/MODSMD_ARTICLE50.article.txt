# Soccer Men Smooth But Contest Tied
## 
### Joe Lanidrac 
The Boogey of Tied Scores again
haunted the Stanford soccermen
when it let the San Mateo J.C. var
sity hold the Indian team to a 1 to 1 I
tie Saturday morning.
Playing like a smooth machine i
against the wind and the Jaysee 1
sccci rites, Stanford's players only'
rang up the first ficore of the game
in the third quarter after taking 18
previous goal shots. Art Hearn, cen
ter forward, shot the ball through
the close-guarded goalmouth. With
only 15 minutes to go in the last 2'l
- quarter, the Jaysee forward
line slipped their single saving tally
through Milt Newman's goal-guard
ing hands.
Cards Superior
Playing an obviously superior
game, the Indians failed to kick the I
necessary winning goal in the 10- j
minute overtime period. In this;
extra-period play-off came the!
only Stanford substitutions with j
Winstead "Greeper" Weaver inserted ;
temporarily for Mike Gomez, Wea
ver being replaced in turn by Dan '
Hansen, Knecht thereby moving to '
inside. The rest of the team re- |
mained intact throughput the hour J
and 40 minutes of scrimmage. Carl J
Kecht, captain, Gomez, Hearn,
Sven Doddington, and John Moore ;
were the starting forward line, all ;
playing splendidly in spite of the 26 !
shots taken to score the one goal. I
Numerous balls whizzed close past j
the enemy goal; one beautifully,
headed ball missed by inches; sev
eral smacked and rebounded from j
the white goalposts; and the rest i
were saved by San Mateo's goalie.
Stanford's defense was splendid,
the halfback line playing its best 1
game. Doug Kennedy, eligible for I
the first teaming, starred at center i
half. Rudy Gonzales and Waddy
White covered the wing backs.
At fullback Cy Johnson was again ,
in uniform and, with Dick Strouse,
repeatedly sent the threatening pel
let back up the field into enemy |
territory. At goalie, Newman ably j
filled Jack King's shoes, executing
several difficult saves.
Clean Game
Fouls were in evidence, but were
comparatively few in contrast with
the last San Mateo contest. Stan- j
fcrd's one score resulted indirectly;
from a foul on White. Strouse,
dropping the ball smack-dab into j
the goal area, kicked to Hearn who i
finished the scoring play.
Although the U.C. Bears have J
twice defeated San Mateo, the Bear
team being the strongest in years, j
with Stanford playing as smoothly j
as it aid Saturday, Coach Harry Ma
loney sees a good chance of the t
Indians winning its three-game Cal- !
ifornia series which begins Wed-| 1

Playing an obviously superior
game, the Indians failed to kick the I
necessary winning goal in the 10- j
minute overtime period. In this;
extra-period play-off came the!
only Stanford substitutions with j
Winstead "Greeper" Weaver inserted ;
temporarily for Mike Gomez, Wea
ver being replaced in turn by Dan '
Hansen, Knecht thereby moving to '
inside. The rest of the team re- |
mained intact throughput the hour J
and 40 minutes of scrimmage. Carl J
Kecht, captain, Gomez, Hearn,
Sven Doddington, and John Moore ;
were the starting forward line, all ;
playing splendidly in spite of the 26 !
shots taken to score the one goal. I
Numerous balls whizzed close past j
the enemy goal; one beautifully,
headed ball missed by inches; sev
eral smacked and rebounded from j
the white goalposts; and the rest i
were saved by San Mateo's goalie.
Stanford's defense was splendid,
the halfback line playing its best 1
game. Doug Kennedy, eligible for I
the first teaming, starred at center i
half. Rudy Gonzales and Waddy
White covered the wing backs.
At fullback Cy Johnson was again ,
in uniform and, with Dick Strouse,
repeatedly sent the threatening pel
let back up the field into enemy |
territory. At goalie, Newman ably j
filled Jack King's shoes, executing
several difficult saves.
Clean Game
Fouls were in evidence, but were
comparatively few in contrast with
the last San Mateo contest. Stan- j
fcrd's one score resulted indirectly;
from a foul on White. Strouse,
dropping the ball smack-dab into j
the goal area, kicked to Hearn who i
finished the scoring play.
Although the U.C. Bears have J
twice defeated San Mateo, the Bear
team being the strongest in years, j
with Stanford playing as smoothly j
as it aid Saturday, Coach Harry Ma
loney sees a good chance of the t
Indians winning its three-game Cal- !
ifornia series which begins Wed-| 1

The Boogey of Tied Scores again
haunted the Stanford soccermen
when it let the San Mateo J.C. var
sity hold the Indian team to a 1 to 1 I
tie Saturday morning.
Playing like a smooth machine i
against the wind and the Jaysee 1
sccci rites, Stanford's players only'
rang up the first ficore of the game
in the third quarter after taking 18
previous goal shots. Art Hearn, cen
ter forward, shot the ball through
the close-guarded goalmouth. With
only 15 minutes to go in the last 2'l
- quarter, the Jaysee forward
line slipped their single saving tally
through Milt Newman's goal-guard
ing hands.
