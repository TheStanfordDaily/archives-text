# Card Babes, San Mateo Freshmen Tie in Soccer
## 
### 
Although they repeatedly threat
ened the San Mateo frosh goal Sat
urday morning, Stanford's freshman
soccer eleven lacked the final punch
that wins ball games. The whistle
sounded with the score still knotted
at 0-0. John Metcalf, with his ac
curate passes; the long-kicking Ed
Washburn; and Pete Knecht, main
cog in the forward wall, led the
Babe attack.
