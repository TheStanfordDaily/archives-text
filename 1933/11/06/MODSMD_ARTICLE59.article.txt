# Four-Game Schedule May Keep Staters from Title
## 
### 
When Oregon and Oregon State
meet in their traditional game, more
than tradition will be at stake this
year. Neither team has been de
feated in Conference play, although
the Staters and U.S.C. tied 0 to 0 in
one of the season's best-played
games.
But even if the Beavers defeat the
Webfeet, their Conference title may
be unclouded. Reasons: the Trojans
must be beaten and Oregon State
plays but four Conference games.
