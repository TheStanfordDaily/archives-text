### 
The Pan-American Conference
due soon in Montevideo, originally
to be busy with political and com
mercial peace, will have to think
about Bolivian-Paraguayan troubles.
Each country is planning to set up a
loud bellyache about its hurt pride;
that it wants peace but to stop
would weaken its moral position.
