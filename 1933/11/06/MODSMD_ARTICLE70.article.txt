• The Editor, Sir:
At the beginning of the season
| when the first A.S.S.U. dances were
held it was said that a good turnout
would result in lower prices. The
three dances to date have been more
than well attended. How about the
I premised reduction?
Many good men and true can't
I dish out the six-bitty, and the pres
j ent system has made the affair a
couple dance. A rough is forced to
j pay the same toll as a couple. With
the eight hundred still in a minority
I of one to three against the sex fa
vored by Mrs. Stanford, at least
| seventeen hundred of Stanford's
BEST are left out of the 'Back to
j the Farm" movement. We demand
iat least equal l ights with these
! women. An addition of a mere three
j hundred women with perceptibly
elevated schnozzles shouldn't mate
| rially change the situation.
Two-bits a head would be plenty.
' Especially for some of the 'cab
i bages" around here. (One young
i gentleman in our midst suggests
J omitting the "some of.") This plan
would uphold Stanford's MOST DE
SIRABLE tradition—Democracy.
Of course we admit that there are
a few mighty tysty packages around
j here. However, with eight hundred
j Jean Harlows in our midst we would
still demand our equality.
