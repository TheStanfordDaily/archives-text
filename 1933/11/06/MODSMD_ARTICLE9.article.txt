# CARD INJURIES MOUNT TO NINE WITH O. C. WIN
## Johnny Reisner May Have Broken Ribs; Trompas Gets Bruised Hip 21 TO 0 FINAL SCORE Second Half Drive Features Grayson, Alustiza 
### Spud Hamilton 
An injured Stanford team is to
day taking account of itself. After
drubbing the Olympic Club in a sec
ond half drive, 21' to 0, Stanford
suddenly realized they had done
themselves no good in the winning.
With injuries incurred against the
Olympians plus those from last week
the Cardinal disabled list has
mounted to nine men.
Johnny Reisner has probable
broken ribs; Lylc Smith a broken
bone in the hand; Trompas, a
bruised hip bone; O'Connor, Van
Dellen, and Trompas have minor
cuts. Frank Alustiza and Bobby
Grayson are both in the hospital.
Bob Maentz, Monk Moscrip, and
Lee Blanchard arc holdovers from
last week.
Chalk Saturday's victory up to
Grayson and Alustiza, who ran and
kicked and passed their way all over
the Clubmen. Grayson carried the
ball 25 times, averaged four yards
a carry, and scored two touchdowns,
while Alustiza averaged 45 yards
punting and scored one touchdown.
Grayson Enters Game
With a first half nearly over and
the stands yawning, Bobby Grayson
entered the game, and Earl Hoos
came out, while Frank Alustiza was
shifted from full to quarterback. On
the first play Grayson drove out for
10 yards and the game really began.
The Olympics had been pushing
Stanford around and had just driven
to the Red 24-yaicl line on a series
of four first downs. After Gray
son's initial 10 yards, Ahistiza quick
kicked 55 yards to the O.C. 1-yard
line, and repeated a few minutes
later with a 60-yard kick that went
over the goal line.
Cards Halted at Goal
Baird kicked for the Olympics to
Reisner who was nailed on the Stan
ford 46, and the Cardinals opened
up an offensive that banked right
down to the goal, only to be halted
within inches of a score.
Grayson and White hogged the
show, with the Portland flash driv
ing hard over the tackles, while
White went booming over right
tackle on simple reverses. The
Olympic Club smeared Grayson at
the 1-yard line, but when Sugden
kicked, Lyle Smith boomed in to
partially block the ball.
Stanford Scores Plenty
Reisner raced back with the short
punt, 15 yards to the O.C. 9. He
made 7 yards on the next play, but
Grayson could only make half a
yard in two attempts and the visi
tors took the ball again. Hardeman
stepped out of the end zone while
kicking and thereby gave Stanford
an automatic safety and a 2-0 lead.
Stanford opened the second half
with Hamilton back at right half,
and Van Dellen playing left. After
fiddling around for a while Stan
ford got an opening when Muller
intercepted Baird's pass and ran it
10 yards to the Stanford 32. Gray
son went wide and cut in sharply
to go for a 30-yard gain. Alustiza
passed to Hamilton for 11 yards, and
on the next play took the ball him
selft on a 10-yard pass from Gray
son and ambled past the Olympic
secondary 20 yards for Stanford's
first touchdown.
