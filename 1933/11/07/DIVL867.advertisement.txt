"WHEN A FELLER
NEEDS^^iEND^'
... here's a friend, indeed!
Placed on the market a few months ago,
this pipe mixture made many friends he'
fore it had a line of advertising.
Said one smoker to another: "Try a pipe
ful of this mellow mixture. I've paid much
more for tobacco not nearly so good!"
Aged in the wood for years . . . there's
not a bite in a barrel of BRIGGS! But
BRIGGS would much rather talk in your
pipe than in print. Won't you try a tin
and let it speak for itself?
I ,
BRIGGS Pipe Mixture is also sold in 1-pound and
tins . . . nnd in 1-pound Humidor Kegs.
