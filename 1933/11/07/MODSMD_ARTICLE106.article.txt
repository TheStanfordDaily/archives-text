# Purdue Educator Favors Removal of Graduations
## 
### 
Abolition of university gradu
ation has been proposed by a promi
nent member of the Purdue Uni
versity, says the Purdue Exponent.
Comment by Exponent: "If grad
uation were eliminated we wonder
how many students would attend a
university at all and how many
would attend for the full four years,
now necessary for graduation.
"Naturally upon abolition of grad
uation, required courses, semester
hours, et al., would be abolished.
No time would be wasted in a course
ill-fitted to the student's wish and
desired future."
