The Editor, Sir:
It seems to me that the current
controversy between Messrs. Cha
pin, Botasof and Saadi (or Saadi,
Botasof and Chapin, or Botasof,
Chapin and Saadi, depending on
ycur estimation of their relative es
timation of their importance) is a
perfect example of the impractical
attitude engendered by too long
residence in a sheltered institution
of learning.
Those who are in touch with hap
penings in Iho great world outside
our little refuge are accustomed to
view such occurrences with a touch
of sadness, but with the attitude
that it is something that must be
endured. So thinking, we take it
and leave it. Might I suggest this
as a good policy for all concerned in
this affair so that we may be spared
the trouble of futile recriminations.
As for Mr. Chapin, "Qui s'excuse,
s'accuse."
