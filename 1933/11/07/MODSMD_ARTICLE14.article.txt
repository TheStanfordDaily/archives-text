# Coward Satire Will Be Read
## Sword and Sandals to Read Coward's 'Hay Fever' 
### 
As its first reading since that of
Ibsen's "Rosmersholm" late last
summer quarter, Sword and San
dals will present a reading of Noel
Coward's mad satire, "Hay Fever,"
in the Little Theatre on Thursday
evening at 8:15 o'clock.
The departure from the estab
lished curtain time has been made
to avoid a clash with the U.S.C.
game rally which it will follow di
rectly.
This is the first of two readings
scheduled for the quarter by the
men's honorary dramatic organiza
tion. The second, to be presented on
December 7, will be "Richard II,"
perhaps Shakespeare's first true
tragedy.
"Hay Fever" is one of Coward's
best plays and probably more last
ing because of its satiric quality
than such of his plays as concern
themselves onlji secondarily with
satire.
It was produced on the campus a
half dozen years ago under the di
rection of Gordon Davis, now an
associate producer with Baldwin
McGaw at the Fairmont Playhouse
in San Francisco. It has, as well,
been given several productions on
the coast by little theatre groups
although no professional production
has toured it so far west.
New York has seen it twice; the
first production, in 1926, starred
Laura Hope Crews; a revival, last
year, had the English commedienne,
Constance Collier, in the role of
temperamental Judith Bliss.
The play concerns the frenzy of a
week-end party in an artistic house
hold composed of a defiantly aging
actress, a more sane writer of bad
novels, and two younger children
who have adopted their parents'
more audacious peculiarities.
James Benet is directing the read
ing and has selected a cast which,
in first reading - rehearsals, looks
highly satisfactory. It will be an
nounced later.
