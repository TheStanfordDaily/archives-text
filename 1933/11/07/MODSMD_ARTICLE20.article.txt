# TALENTED AIDS TO ASSIST BIG GAME GAIETIES
## Helvenston Starts Work On Production; Second Tryout Tonight 
### Mary Liles 
Working under Director Harold
Helvenston in the presentation of
the Big Game Gaieties of 1933 will
bt three competent and experienced
assistants.
The chorus directors are Miss Ad
elaide Kelly and Mrs. (Frances
Boone) Ditzler, both of whom are
former Stanford students, and are
taking steps to further a School of
the Dance in Palo Alto. They have
both studied extensively with mas
ters of the modern dance, and the
fact that they are working together
on the Gaieties means excellent help
to the success of that production.
In fact, Miss Kelly is no novice in
that capacity, having been director
of hoofing in 1928 and 1932.
Acting in the capacity of musical
director is Gordon Heche, with
whom Helvenston is slaving over
the musical scores. Heche is well
known on the campus as director
of a campus dance orchestra, and
for his contributions to the Gaieties
of previous years, for which he
wrote a considerable portion of the
music—notably, the first act finale
of last year.
For the benefit of prospective par
ticipants another tryout will be held
tonight from 7:30 until 10 o'clock in
the Assembly Hall. All tryoutees
are asked by Director Helvenston to
wear practice clothes—eliminating
impedimenta, but excluding bathing
suits. The choruses are to be based
upon the best selection of small and
larger girls, respectively — ponies
and beauties. The powers that be
have in mind one or two novelty
and comedy choruses, and the
search for ideas is on! Tryouts for
satirical, humorous skits or dia
logues may be done individually or
in £^o.u pies.
"Kaiiiough n iarge number of
sketches have been received to date
which are excellent, the time limit
has been extended to Thursday at
4 o'clock to enable any further sub
missions to be considered for ac
ceptance. By means of this exten
sion of time, it is hoped that the
very best available talent ori the
campus will reach the consideration
of the producers. Songs must be in
between 4 and (5 o'clock on the same
day. Everything must be submitted
to Director Helvenston in his office,
Room 203.

between 4 and (5 o'clock on the same
day. Everything must be submitted
to Director Helvenston in his office,
Room 203.
Working under Director Harold
Helvenston in the presentation of
the Big Game Gaieties of 1933 will
bt three competent and experienced
assistants.
The chorus directors are Miss Ad
elaide Kelly and Mrs. (Frances
Boone) Ditzler, both of whom are
former Stanford students, and are
taking steps to further a School of
the Dance in Palo Alto. They have
both studied extensively with mas
ters of the modern dance, and the
fact that they are working together
on the Gaieties means excellent help
to the success of that production.
In fact, Miss Kelly is no novice in
that capacity, having been director
of hoofing in 1928 and 1932.
Acting in the capacity of musical
director is Gordon Heche, with
whom Helvenston is slaving over
the musical scores. Heche is well
known on the campus as director
of a campus dance orchestra, and
for his contributions to the Gaieties
of previous years, for which he
wrote a considerable portion of the
music—notably, the first act finale
of last year.
For the benefit of prospective par
ticipants another tryout will be held
tonight from 7:30 until 10 o'clock in
the Assembly Hall. All tryoutees
are asked by Director Helvenston to
wear practice clothes—eliminating
impedimenta, but excluding bathing
suits. The choruses are to be based
upon the best selection of small and
larger girls, respectively — ponies
and beauties. The powers that be
have in mind one or two novelty
and comedy choruses, and the
search for ideas is on! Tryouts for
satirical, humorous skits or dia
logues may be done individually or
in £^o.u pies.
"Kaiiiough n iarge number of
sketches have been received to date
which are excellent, the time limit
has been extended to Thursday at
4 o'clock to enable any further sub
missions to be considered for ac
ceptance. By means of this exten
sion of time, it is hoped that the
very best available talent ori the
campus will reach the consideration
of the producers. Songs must be in
between 4 and (5 o'clock on the same
day. Everything must be submitted
to Director Helvenston in his office,
Room 203.
