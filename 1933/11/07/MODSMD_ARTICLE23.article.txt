# BURIED ROME IS TOPIC OF CAREY TALK
## Lantern Slides Accompany Archaeologist's Lecture In Little Theatre 
### 
Tonight's Tuesday evening pro- ,
gram presents Professor Frederick 1
M. Carey of the American Academy j
in Rome, and Associate Professor j
of Greek and Latin at the University
of California at Los Angeles. Carey
will speak on "New Excavations in
Rome," at 7:30 o'clock in the Little !
Theatre.
Professor Carey's lecture will deal i
with the excavations in Rome that j
hpve been carried on in recent years
by the goveiTiment under Musso- i
lini's direction. Most important ol j
these are the excavation of the Cir- j
cus Maximus and the opening of j
the Theatre of Augustus. Mussolini !
has not only made possible new ex- I
cavations but he has also cleared j
away modern slums which had
grown up about the old ruins.
The main part of the talk will
cover the excavations of the four j
Republican temples in the Zona Ar- !
gentina and of the Imperial Fora;
these latter are the fora of Augustus,
Julius, and Traajn. The lecture will
be illustrated with lantern slides.
Last year Mr. Carey held a fel
lowship from the American Council
of Learned Societies in the field of
Latin Paleography. But at the same
time he was able to follow the lec
tures at the American Academy at
Rome and examine the Greek and
Roman remains in Southern Italy, j
Sicily, Tripoli, Tunisia, and Algeria, j
He spent the years 1923-24 and 1932- 1
33 at the American Academy with j
occasional visits during summers in j
the interval between those dates, j
so he has been able to witness the !
changes which have taken place j
there.
Since his return from a leave of!
absence visit to Rome last year, Mr. j
Carey has been lecturing for the j
Archaeological Institute of America, j
and it is through the courtesy of this |
Institute that his visit to Stanford '
is made possible.
