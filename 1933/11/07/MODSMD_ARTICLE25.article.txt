# Quads to Be Sold Today On Engineering Corner
## 
### 
Prospective Quad purchasers may J
obtain their volumes this morning ,
at the Engineering corner, where |
staff members will vend the much- j
vaunted yearbook, from 8 to 12
o'clock.
Prices are again announced by
Manager Whitfield as $5.65 for the:
regular volume, $6.65 for senior edi- |
tions which include the picture, for- j
merly priced at $2, and 50 additional j
for name on cover.
A door-to-door drive last night |
raised this year's total, although J
senior purchases still lag. Absence j
of the customary graduate loyalty |
is particularly marked, says Whit- |
field, since the remaining three [
classes have displayed unusual en
thusiasm.
Early buys are urged for those
wishing the '34 edition which in
cludes novel features of interest to
every student on the campus.
