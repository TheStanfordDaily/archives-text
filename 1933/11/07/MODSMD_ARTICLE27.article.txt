Are the Greek Roughs mod
est, shy, or just plain afraid to
view their own likenesses?
This question is being seriously
pondered by Editor Al Sadler
of the Stanford Quad.
He decries the lack of Greeks
who have reported on the sec
ond floor of the Press Building
to approve their photographs.
This is very necessary as 110
pictures will be put into the
Quad unless approved.
All fraternity proofs are now
ready. Sadler urges all modest
gentlemen to put their qualms
aside and okey their proofs.
