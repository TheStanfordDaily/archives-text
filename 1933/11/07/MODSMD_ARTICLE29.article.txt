# Frosh Shout At Rumor Of Big "C" Painted Red
## 
### 
Climaxed with a roof - raising
j shout following the announcement
j of the rumor that the Big "C," tra
| ditional California landmark, had
j just been painted red, Encina's frosh
| last night wildly cheered their Babe
j eleven in the annual rally preceding
| the Little Big Game. Through a
I pungent haze of smoke that was
j thick when Bill Corbus opened the
' spirited program, acrid and heavy
j when the last strains of the hymn
J rose to the rafters, the sprawled six
! hundred enthusiastically approved
i Paajmarino plans, loudly applauded
1 the musical offerings of a quartet,
I the Royal Cardinal Trio, and De
| Witt Blamer, '37, who sang tradi-
I tional Hilly Billy tunes.
Howell Turner was appointed by
; President Ted Guisler during the
course of the program to lead the
i rooting section during the game
| Saturday.
