# Press Still Free
## 
### 
lii Chicago, Hugh S. Johnson said
"the biggest imitation dead cat" yet
thrown at the NRA is the one about
the freedom of the press. The gov
ernment has no intention of at
tempting to control newspapers and
couldn't if it wanted to, he told an
audience of Midwest business men.
He continued, "I am now going to
take an official step which I think
will level this silly bugaboo for
ever."
Five more appeals for NRA sup
port are included in the adminis
trator's Midwestern swing. In this,
his first, he called all objections to
NRA, such as unconstitutionality,
interference with individualism,
either "synthetic dead cats" or
"hobgoblins."
