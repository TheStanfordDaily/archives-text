# "TINY" DRILLS SIM, ALUSTIZA IN NEW PARTS
## Change Promises Triple Threat Backfield In Trojan Contest NEW OFFENSE DEVISED Grayson May Recover In Time for S.C. Game 
### Oliver Johnston, Jr 
Taking new life after their second
half showing against the Olympic
Club, the Indians last night went
through a hard workout, with
Thornhill drilling Alustiza and Sim
on their new positions.
Alustiza's change to quarter was
made definite by his showing Sat
urday, but the shifting of Bill Sim
to half was undecided until practice
started last night. It is not possible
to forget Sim's work at left half
last year. If Maentz, who was in
suit for the first time since the
Washington game, is not able to
start Sim will undoubtedly get the
call.
Four Triple Threat Men
With Alustiza, either- Maentz or
Sim, Hamilton, and Grayson in the
starting backfield the Indians would
be equipped with four triple threat
men. All these men are good block
ers.
A play similar to one used in the
U.S.C. gjame several seasons ago
and which netted good yardage ev
ery time it was used, was pulled out
of the coach's bag last night. Several
new plays, both running plays and
lateral passes, were given a good
working over.
Hillman on First String
Jack Hillman replaced Grayson in
the first string lineup while the lat
ter is in the hospital. Grayson's foot
injury will probably not keep him
under wraps more than a day or so
longer.
The goofs have started work on
Tlie Trojan plays and will be able
to work them against the varisty to
night. There was quite some argu
ment among them as to who would
play Cotton Warburton's and Ro
senburg's position.
Reisner appeared on the field mi
nus his suit, but did not seem to be
bothex'ed by his two cracked ribs.
Alex Trompas limped out onto the
field, also not in a suit.
