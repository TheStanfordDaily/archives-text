# An Editor on Two Spots
## 
### 
In the adjoining Campus Opinion column, the Daily
Editor is placed on two spots. Each writer chooses to place
the Editor on one spot: Mr. Philippi uses the Socratic
method of interrogation, Mr. Rogan applies the more mod
ern approach of damning with faint praise. The Editor,
heing a fairlv indivisible sort of person, will try to join the
spots, stand, look happy (though perplexed at heart).
Mr. IMiilippi has the queer notion that if the Daily were
mad(f king, which is a splendid though impossible thought,
i! would abolish football, condemn the Rally Committee
to a slow death at the stake, and then dance with a fiendish
glee over the corpses of its victims. That is a new thought,
new to everyone including the Editor.
Football is a fine sport, to the Editor at least, the most
interesting college game to watch. He objects to the way
city papers try to pervert it, treat it as a professional thing
like big league baseball or horse racing. A college player
that errs is razed to death. That is unfair. A college team
that loses is lumped with baby-snatchers, bomb-throwers,
wife-beaters. Having lost at Stanford at times, we should
know that is untrue.
Hut that same spirit sometimes creeps on to the campus.
The tired quarterback w ho does not call the 3,000 different
plays that .'{,ooo bleacher coaches are positive he should
call, is a public enemy. That is ridiculous; the Daily would
like to point out the ridiculosity. It all comes from think
ing that football is the most important thing in the world,
which is not so. There are hot hamburgers and black cof
fee at three in the morning, there is the "800" even at 2:.'JO
in the morning, and there is an education to think about
(though not enough to be bothersome).
It is this excess ballyhoo iu football that the Daily criti
cizes; not the sport.
Hut that is only one spot, t'p pops the other spot to
flatten the editorial beagle against the editorial map, if
the Daily criticizes Rally Committee and football (which
Campus Opinioner No. 2 thinks is fine), why do we print
their doings? The Daily is a student paper. It is only right
and fair that these two activities should be given space.
Students are interested in them and anything, i.e. anything
not too libelous, and not too obscene, that interests stu
dents is printed. Or at least, the Daily tries to.
In short, the Daily is annoyed when some students be
gin taking themselves too seriously, begin to feel that the
whole I'niversitv is on their shoulders. Yes, and the Daily
is most peeved when it takes itself 100 seriously.

Mr. IMiilippi has the queer notion that if the Daily were
mad(f king, which is a splendid though impossible thought,
i! would abolish football, condemn the Rally Committee
to a slow death at the stake, and then dance with a fiendish
glee over the corpses of its victims. That is a new thought,
new to everyone including the Editor.
Football is a fine sport, to the Editor at least, the most
interesting college game to watch. He objects to the way
city papers try to pervert it, treat it as a professional thing
like big league baseball or horse racing. A college player
that errs is razed to death. That is unfair. A college team
that loses is lumped with baby-snatchers, bomb-throwers,
wife-beaters. Having lost at Stanford at times, we should
know that is untrue.
Hut that same spirit sometimes creeps on to the campus.
The tired quarterback w ho does not call the 3,000 different
plays that .'{,ooo bleacher coaches are positive he should
call, is a public enemy. That is ridiculous; the Daily would
like to point out the ridiculosity. It all comes from think
ing that football is the most important thing in the world,
which is not so. There are hot hamburgers and black cof
fee at three in the morning, there is the "800" even at 2:.'JO
in the morning, and there is an education to think about
(though not enough to be bothersome).
It is this excess ballyhoo iu football that the Daily criti
cizes; not the sport.
Hut that is only one spot, t'p pops the other spot to
flatten the editorial beagle against the editorial map, if
the Daily criticizes Rally Committee and football (which
Campus Opinioner No. 2 thinks is fine), why do we print
their doings? The Daily is a student paper. It is only right
and fair that these two activities should be given space.
Students are interested in them and anything, i.e. anything
not too libelous, and not too obscene, that interests stu
dents is printed. Or at least, the Daily tries to.
In short, the Daily is annoyed when some students be
gin taking themselves too seriously, begin to feel that the
whole I'niversitv is on their shoulders. Yes, and the Daily
is most peeved when it takes itself 100 seriously.
In the adjoining Campus Opinion column, the Daily
Editor is placed on two spots. Each writer chooses to place
the Editor on one spot: Mr. Philippi uses the Socratic
method of interrogation, Mr. Rogan applies the more mod
ern approach of damning with faint praise. The Editor,
heing a fairlv indivisible sort of person, will try to join the
spots, stand, look happy (though perplexed at heart).
