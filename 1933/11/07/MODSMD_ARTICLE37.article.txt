# Afraid of Their Own Words

The Palo Alio Times, venerable paper of a venerable
city, lias recently condemned the Republicans for presum
ing to attack the X.R.A. They label tbeir editorial "Party
Plan Marked by Basic Stupidity," and then launch into a
vigorous verbal Having of the two-party system.
If anyone were to suggest to the Times that if favored
a dictator and the abolition of this grand thing called de
mocracy, il would probably jump back and sing "America
the Beautiful"; follow that by a recitation of the Preamble
to the Constitution, and maybe even Lincoln's Gettysburg
address.
Democracy depends on criticism. While every once in
a while partisan criticism may ruin some scheme, in the
long run it keeps Ihe party in power from over-stepping
i tself.
The Times assumes that difference of opinion neces
sarily implies vile motives. That is not the case. Text-book
oracles differ, politicians differ, even students differ. That
is wholesome.
