Daii.y on Ihe same subject, to wit: the selection of mem
bers for the forthcoming radio debate. Each starts with
the innocent assumption "if the Daily story is correct."
The natural question: "Is it?"
The answer: "It is and it isn't"; i.e. part right and part
wrong.
One judge, and only one judge, spoke about the "best
voice"; but did not vote that best voice the best speaker.
The reporter heard the judge and assumed best voice (as
il was a radio debate) to mean best debater. That is not
necessarily true by any means. Other factors enter into the
selection.
The other point of contention was the identity of tlie
speakers. The fifteen spoke, identity unknown. Then a
dadlock was reached. Then and then only the identity of
the speakers was revealed. The judges in their opinion
selected the best two speakers, regardless of whether they
were graduates or undergraduates.
The process was not technically according to announce
ment but seemed necessary to the judges in their deadlock,
(irads probably have a right to be peeved, hardly irate.
Judges probably had to act as they did. Kesull: unfortu
nate incident greatly magnified.
