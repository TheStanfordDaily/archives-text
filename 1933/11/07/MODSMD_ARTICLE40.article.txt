# INTERROGATES EDITOR
## 
### 
Dear Abe:
I'd like to ask two questions of
you, who in such an unprecedented
manner upset the notorious poker
trust last spring. Said questions
have been aroused in my mind from
reading your editorials of the past
month.
J. What material good for your
self, the student body, and the school
do you expect to derive from your
Continued Criticism of football? I
ask this question notv/ithstanding
the fact that the winds of freedom
blow.
2. What is the reason for unequi
vocally giving the works to the
Rt: 11 y Committee? You act like a
person of whom one of the Rally
Committee members has stolen a
piece of candy. Can you see no
good in what these people do, or is
their only duty to try and work up
artificial enthusiasm for your other
pet aversion, football?
Your puerile prattle may be what
the Great American Public likes to
lead about colleges, but it is only
causing more trouble in a place
where it is least wanted or needed.
Your editorial stand seems to grate
on the nerves of those who enjoyed
your Bull Session. Yours,
R. Phillippi, '34.
