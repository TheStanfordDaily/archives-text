There are various evils which
j grow like fungi upon the benign
i face of this campus—animal, vege
! tcible, and mineral. There are the
! occasional ones, the frequent ones,
and the continuous ones, and they'll
none of them be missed. But the
one that will be the least missed of
them all is the two-unit course.
With that admonition tucked away
in your mental recesses, you may
say to yourself, "Very well, I shall
avoid two-unit courses." But it
isn't as easy as that, my fine friend.
Two-unit courses are not merely
evils; they are necessary evils; in
j short, they are inevitably, irretriev
] ably, and incontrovertibly require
| ments—not to be dismissed with a
I perfunctory word to your obliging
adviser.
Some departments have a special
coips of assistants hired to do noth
ing but devise two-unit require
ments, and the more gifted asssi
: tants receive higher salaries than the
J professors, one suspects. Theirs is
| certainly the more arduous task.
i You will find that a two-unit
■■ course is just one gala social whirl,
| a continuous round of activity, but
oh, so broadening!
On the first day you will be
; handed a neat little bundle of syl
| labus, roughly resembling the En
cyclopedia Brittanica (14th Edition).
. This is your most precious posses
-1 sion, to be consulted in any type of
i adversity or despair, so guard it with
I your life.
j This will give you more pointers
| on what is really the etiquette of the
course. It will contain the gentle
statement that there will be weekly

I papers due at the crack of dawn on
the morning after you have been to
the city dancing or otherwise frit
tering your time away. On the other
| c'ay of the class you are given more
J of p choice, but above all, don't use
the wrong fork, or you will be for
ever an outcast. Your menu will
offer a choice of an examination, an
oral report, answering a barrage of
questions, or (generally and) an im
promptu dissertation on the histojry
' of the Byzantine Empire.
A few weeks latex', you will be
. feted with a gala round of exami
nations, which you will attend in
formal attire, of course. I cannot
prescribe your conduct 011 those oc
casions; it depends on the night be
fore.
Still later, you will be honored
: r.i what is called a "final," a vulgar
term for debut (as the French say),
for by that time, you will have
'"come out." —Elizabeth Chapin
