THE WAY TO LOVE (Paramount)
At the Stanford Theatre
picture opens with the usual
atmospherico-musical sequence of
rhymed dialogue, which is deemed
necessary as a prelude to any Che
valier picture. Then come some
] very funny scenes in the shop of
Edward Everett Horton, love doc
tor, who is at his usual best. Just
i as one sits up to enjoy the picture
thoroughly, the middle reels sag,
and one settles down to weather the
! film's dramatic burden.
Ann Dvork, a befriended waif, re- i
nounces her love for Chevalier—all
i for his own good—and goes off to |
sob alone, while Maurice, a modern
Fi&ncois Villon according to the
script, also sobs alone. After this j
too, too serious sogginess come good
comedy scenes again, with Horton
and Chevalier performing capably
in the manner of Laurel and Hardy
and Harold Lloyd. (At the end of
i the picture the waif is re-discovered
land rescued.)
The comedy scenes are excep
! tionally and consistently funny. Ri- J
vailing Horton for funnyman honors j
is some unkonwn cinemactor, who
apparently is perpetually drunk. In j
spite of the marathon quality of his ;
intoxication, he is still funny. All
the gags are either original, or done i
with a spontaneity which makes
rthem seem so. Chevalier widens his
range of comedy beyond his personal
mannerisms to include a general !
pruning of people's neckties and a
burlesque wrestling match.
Avoid the shorts—a dismal Andy
Clyde comedy and a fashion show
i with pseudo - humorous announcer
—by arriving at 7:40 o'clock.

MIDSHIPMAN JACK (R.K.0.)
At the Varsity Theatre
It's entirely unethical for a col- j
legiate reviewer to praise a picture
whose title is so reminiscent of the |
days of "Dead-eye Dick." Further-
I more, it's almost an abhorrence
when one is stold that the plot is
| trite and the theme sentimental.
\et, for some undefineable reason,
i with all these grave charges against
it, this picture "rings the bell."
! Searching for an alibi (there must
!be one!) one can blame the excel
: lent and entire elimination of the
j "Hollywood touch."
Bruce Cabot portrays the mid
shipman who has the "right stuff in
him." But, being an individualist,
|he can't obey the rules. It takes the
commandant's daughter, a couple
1 of earnest plebes, and a naval crack
up to show how necessary it is for
I the navy man, no matter how great,
to "practice what he preaches."
Somehow, this picture brings to
life idealistic aims and spirit of the
national academy. Leave your
newly acquired collegiate savoir
faire at home for one evening (if at
heart you hide a few ounces of un
rnodern sentimentality) and enjoy a
| sincerely moving-picture.

MY WOMAN (Columbia)
Getting off to a horrible start, the
i plot finally allows Helen Twelve

trees to don attractive clothes and
enter a tragic situation. In most se
quences she is an unconvincing per
former, but alluring Helen can be
tragic. As the misunderstood, unap
propriated wife, she makes the pic
ture interesting for a while. Harri
son Ford is unexpectedly good as
the ham comedian who becomes a
national radio sensation due to his
wife's script ability and attraction
for a big radio corporation official
(Victor Jory).
The plot is so obvious and over
used that one is surprised at the
sheer nerve of the studio (it couldn't
be stupidity) in once again trying
to pan it off on the poor, depres
sion-dazed American audience. To
somewhat effective efforts of the
three stars to pull the show through
is all that permits one to sit through
it. —Brill
