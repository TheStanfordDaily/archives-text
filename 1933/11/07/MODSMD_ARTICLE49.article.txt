Moral Training
From the great mass of material

was condensed the Charter, a dec
laration of the rights of childhoodâ€”
"For every child these rights, re
gardless of race, of color, or situa
tion, wherever he may live under
the protection of the American flag."
Every phase of the needs and
l ights of the child world is articu
lated. "For every child understand
ing and the guarding of his per
sonality is his most precious right.
For every child spiritual and moral
training to help him to stand firm
under the pressure of life." . . . .
these are expressions of the Chil
dren's Charter.
