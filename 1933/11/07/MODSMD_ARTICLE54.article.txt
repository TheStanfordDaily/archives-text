Tulane University's news
paper prints news of 30 years
ago:
"Taddiken, '00, was arrested
during the pit paty at Tulane
last Saturday night, hailed into
court on charges of riotous
conduct â€” making paper wads
and throwing them into the
audience. Monday morning
Taddiken was fined $25 or 10
days, without any chance to
to testify in his own behalf or
call witnesses to his innocence,
on the affidavit of the cop
who arrested him and got a
rebate on the fine. . . .
"Rules for freshmen:
" 'Whereas, Freshmen have
been duly declared to belong
the genus assinius with little
mind, no shape and void of at
tributes of the higher types of
animal life; Be it resolved:
(1) That no Freshman will
be permitted to wear a stiff hat
unless he removes same
promptly upon the appearance
of an upperclassman.
(2) That no Freshman will
be permitted to stand or stroll
upon the campus with a pioe
in his mouth, but may smoke
same while kneeling on one
knee, his attitude being one of
thankfulness to the upperclass
men for the great privilege.
. . ." (And so on. . . .)
