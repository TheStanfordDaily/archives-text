# U.C., U.C.L.A., AIR NEW CREDIT PLAN
## 
### 
U.C.L.A. and California see them
| selves as one of the foremost ex-
I perimental universities in the world,
with a new plan for optional "crcdit
Iby examination," which the Aca
, deniic Senate approved and will be
' placed in effect next semester.
No enrollment in courses will be
required to obtain credit for gradu
; alien. No papers, no check up, no
course of study, just ability to pass
| the comprehensive exam is the gist
! of the scheme.
Only laboratory and field courses
will be exempted in all probability,
| when final details are drawn up.
I Comments and suggestions will be
! forthcoming from the deans of the
various colleges.
Professor Joel H. Hildebrand,
i chairman of educational policy com
mittee of the Academic Senate, was
j quick to point out: "Although simi-
I lar to the system adopted by the
University of Chicago, to the expe
| rimental college of the University of
Wisconsin, and to the Oxford and
i German plans abroad, the Univer
; sity arrangement will have charac
teristic features of its own."
He further expostulated: "Success
of this departure from educational
! precedent depends on student co
operation. It can develop student
: intelligence, initiative, and respon
sibility, as well as aid educational
improvement and, incidentally, econ
omy."
Though most students will be ex
pected to study in established fields,
a student may independently study
in a field which no university course
j covers. The sole restriction is that
the field be of academic caliber, and
one in which a competent examiner
! if; available on the faculty.

The intelligentsia don't make a
! very good audience—they are too
I hard to educate.—Nancy Carroll
