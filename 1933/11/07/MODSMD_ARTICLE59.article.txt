# Women Will Carry Pom-Poms at S.C. Game
## 
### 
Women, immune from the rooters'
cap rule at the Southern California
rooting section, will carry pom-poms
instead, decided Rally Committee
members at their meeting last night.
The fluffy red and white emblems
will be purchased outside the sta
dium on Saturday.
Rooters' tickets, becoming scarce
as proverbial hen's teeth, will still
be available today at the B.A.C. if
the supply of turned-in ducats holds
out. Railroad accommodations, fast
being gobbled up, are also available
at the A.S.S.U. office, today being
Ihe last day for special Pullman
rates.

Talking pictures are valuable be
cause they give you a chance to see
and hear at the same time. â€”Vice-
President Charles Curtis
