# PRESENT ENDS BEST IN 5-YEAR PERIOD
## 
### 
Stanford has this year perhaps the
best group of ends she has had in
the last five years. The credit is due
to Jim Lawson, Indian end coach.
Jim Moscrip, one of the outstand
ing ends in the country, heads the
list. He is closely followed by A1
Norgard, who plays the other end.
Lylt Smith, Keith Topping, Alex
Trompas, and .Dave Packard would
be good enough for first on most
any other starting line-ups.
All of these men were good before
they went under Lawson's tutelage.
A hint here and there ancr construc
tive criticism have brought all of
them up to a position where Thom
-1:5.11 is not afraid to throw any one
of them against the strongest oppo
sition.
