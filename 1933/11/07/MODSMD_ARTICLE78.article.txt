# VARSITY NETMEN DOWN FRESHMEN
## 
### Julius Jacobs 
Playing the third of their informal
I seiies of afternoon matches, Keith
I Gledhill and Joe Coughlin dallied j
I around in the first .set with Frosh
! Ben Dey and Bill Seward, worked
I hard to win the second, and ran
| rampant to win the third by a score !
; of 6-2.
These unscl>eduled matches form
the best tennis entertainment dished j
out to campus fans for many quar- J
ters. Each week the small gallery'
I of spectators has gained in numbers, '
! as the two Intercollegiate netmen
I are leisurely regaining some of their
| form, lost since the last summer i
I tourneys.
Seward and Dey both played rag
' gedly, offering not too-much work
j for the veteran doubles team of
i Coughlin and Gledhill. Sewards'
I usually dynamic backhand was>
J week, while both frosh had a bad !
j da> on their forehand stroking,
i Although both yearlings have
j powerful services, they were non
! plussed by heady returns of Gled
| hill, while the accurate volleying of j
| Coughlin up at net on occasion
j caught both freshmen flatfooted near
I the baseline.
