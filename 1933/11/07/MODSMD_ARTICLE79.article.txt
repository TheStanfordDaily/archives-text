# Rules to Guard Touch Tackles
## 
### 
Touch football men sustain more j
serious injuries than their much
publicized, better-known fellows on
the varsity squad. The number of ,
injuries is more serious in propor- j
lion to the effort required in the,
two types of play, and as a result j
the touch games are under close j
scrutiny by the members of the
Student Health Service, foretelling
a possible change in the rules in- j
tended lo eliminate some of the I
hazards of intra-mural sports.
Each day a complete report is
turned in to Dr. Shepard, director
of the Student Health Service, re- |
garding the nature of the injury and
the manner in which it was ob
tained. These reports go into a file j
in Dr. Shepard's office and will be
used later on as the basis for a dis
cussion which will decide the dan- i
gerous parts of play and design rules |
to eliminate them. Each injury is j
listed according to type and the j
manner in which it was obtained, j
and in this way Dr. Shepard feels t
that when the time comes for the I
change in the rules there will be
an authoritative source of informa
tion on the subject.
