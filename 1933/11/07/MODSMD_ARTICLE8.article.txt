# STUDENTS VOTE FOR REPEAL IN LIQUOR DEBATE
## Bare Margin of Six Votes Doom Affirmative Team In Close Contest SHIBLEY, YAPLE STAR Negative Claims Sustention Of Control Unfair 
### 
Overwhelming disapproval of the
present liquor control on campus
was lacking at last night's informal
debate of Stanford's recently-formed
Public Forum. Question: "Resolved,
That This House Favors the Pro
hibition of Intoxicating Liquors on
the Stanford Campus."
Witty remarks of clever orator
George Shibley, speaking for the af
firmative, and seriously presented
historical facts told by calm-speak
ing Maxine Yaple of the affirmative,
vied for honors after an hour and a
half of colorful discussion. Results:
26 students favoring change of pres
ent liquor rules on campus and 20
upholding present prohibition plans.
Affirmative side's approval of pro
hibition based on Stanford's histo
rical trial and error method was lost
to a negative side stressing maturity
of the "upper tenth" by a bare six
votes. Chairman of the meeting
Frank Fullenwider presided over
audience retorts and discussion fol
lowing representative speakers for
the opposing sides.
Claiming that it was "morally
wrong" to sustain regime of prohi
bition on the campus," George Shib
ley proposed that hypocracy be
swept aside, that the bottles be
dragged from under beds and from
backs of closets and that stool pig
eons who made up the grapevine in
formation system of the Administra
tion be abandoned for "civilized
c.'impus drinking."
"I propose sanity and orderliness
011 campus," said wet speaker Shib
ley, "but let us learn self-control
and learn to put restraints on our
selves, not have restraints put on
us. There is drinking on the campus,
drunkenness on campus, I say civi
lize the use of intoxicating liquor.''
Quoting an editorial from a 1907
Chappie, Maxine Yaple, charming
dry debater, described the disgrace
ful conditions prevalent at Stanford
before the ban on liquor. "There is
no flagrant disobedience of the laws
now according to administrative au
thorities," she said. Miss Yaple
closed her simply stated remarks
with "after all, the present situation
is so delightfulâ€”with all of its in
fractions."
