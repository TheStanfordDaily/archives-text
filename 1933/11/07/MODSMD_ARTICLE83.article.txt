# MURAL GOLFERS IN SEMI-FINALS
## 
### 
Serving definite notice that they
intended to hold the mural golf
crown, Phi Delta Phi, represented
by a couple of Law School men,
Teague and Allen, advanced into the
semi-final bracket this week-end.
To reach this point the Lawyers de
feated the Sigma Nu mashie-wiel
ders by a 9-7 margin. Clarcy and
Shreve played for Sigma Nu. The
Law School men played efficient
golf for the entire time of the two
round match and never allowed the
issue to come within range of doubt.
At the same time that the Phi
Delta Phi mashie men reached the
semi-finals, Forgers Lieberbaum and
Goldsmith defeated last year's run
ners-up the Theta Xi to take their
place in the bracket beside Law
School men. It was a very closely
contested match in which the issue
was not decided until the last holes.
The result was a three and two ver
dict on the 36-hole match.
Two matches remain yet to be
played in the semi-finals. The Be
tas, who delayed starting for some
time but who have met with success
thus far, play the Chi Psi's. Freer
and Mc√üride are playing for the
Lodge, while Curran and Cosgrove
will support the Beta cause.
The Delta Upsilons play the Pilch
I delegation. May and Sloto from
! Pilch can hold their own in most
I golf company, but may have a hard
j time with Horby and Graves, the
j D.U.'s hope.
I All the semi-final matches will be
116 holes, Manager Marv Kahn an
nounced.
