## HEADMAN YAWNS AT INDIAN PLAYS 
### 
A sombre man with a face like
gray stone .sat in the Stanford Sta
dium press box and yawned
throughout the game Saturday. It
was Howard "Headman" Jones of
Southern California's Trojan, just,
a;; he expressed it, "Out for a bit of
recreation."
A cynic might smile at his expla
nation of a 400-mile trip just to
watch another football game. It
sounds like the proverbial postman
and his holiday walk, but we believe
it'.- the truth. Jones did not con
centrate on the game, nor give the
popular impression of a scout with
binoculars focused intently on the
play, scribbling in a little black
book.
He left that phase of the business
to his able assistants, Cliff Herd and .
Sam Berry, whose regular Saturday 1
chore it is. Jones thought the game,
at least the first half was, as he ad
mitted, "Pretty dull," but he was
impressed with the quick kicking of
Alustiza.
