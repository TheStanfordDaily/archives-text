# COACHES DON'T SEE EVERYTHING
## 
### 
The Trojan coach belied the con
ception of a coach as a keen-eyed
master mind. Once when queried
concerning the formation used by
the Olympic Club, he was at a loss
for an answer. "As a matter of fact,"
he said, "I wasn't looking very
closely." The Olympians ran an
other play with "Rubber Legs"
Baird bouncing off tackle for a nice
gain.
'"Oh yes," Jones said. "They use
Ihe Washington State formation.
Single wirigback with the fullback
deep and the left half close up on
the short side."
The Headman has much the same
reactions to the game as any specta
tor. He was vastly annoyed by what
lie considered a close play miscalled
by the referee. "I don't think that
v/as a complete pass," he muttered.
Not at all callous to the welfare of
the players, Coach Jones showed the
most emotion when it seemed a
Stanford man would crash into the
water faucets after being chased out
of bounds by a Club player. "He
shouldn't have tried to tackle then,
the man was clearly out of bounds,"
he said to no one in particular.
