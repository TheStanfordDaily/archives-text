# JONES COURTEOUS, BUT SAYS NOTHING

### 
Always obliging and courteous to
questioners, the Trojan head was
i'. licent to commit himself. Example,
"Do you still think California is a
shade better than Stanford?"
He shook his head. "I never said
anything about that."
' Does Thornhill coach a more con
s'-rvative game than Warner?"
"Less deception, more power?"
He only nodded, affirmatively.
Jones appeared to enjoy Alustiza's
kicking. Once when a quick kick
overshot the Olympic safety, the
poker-faced coach almost grinned.
"If the ball had hit right, it would
have rolled clear over the goal line,"
he said with admiration.
