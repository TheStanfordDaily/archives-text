# FROSH BREAKS RECORD
## 
### 
Freshman Bob Hoover broke by
eight seconds the Cal-Stanford frosh
<\4O swim record in an unofficial :
practice jaunt yesterday afternoon. ,
Bob negotiated the quarter in 5:47,
whereas the previous mark was
5:55.

I'm afraid my play-writing efforts
have been terribly misunderstood.â€”
