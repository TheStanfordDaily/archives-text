# STANFORD FROSH GRIDDERS POINT FOR U.C. COMBAT
## 
### 
With the injured list dwindling as
the annual California battle rounds
the corner, the Stanford frosh moved
into the last week of their football
season last night with growing con
fidence that they can climax their
year's work with a Little Big Game
victory.
Tangible basis for freshman hopes
was furnished by Coach Jimmie
Bradshaw's report on the California
yearlings, whom he saw play last
Saturday. Though the infant Bears
were impressive in their 14 to U
defeat of Sacramento J.C., Brad
shaw believes his team yields noth
ing to the Berkeley aggregation in
1 strength.
Team Spirit Good
i A California advantage at quar
terback is balanced by Stanford's
strength at the fullback post, while
the Indian line at its best is rated
equal if not superior to the Bears'.
Potential advantage, however, usu
ally plays a minor role in Little Big
Game feuds, the resull more often
hinging upon which team is fired
up the most.
Aided by the incentive of the last
few weeks' relatively poor showing,
Coach Bradshaw hopes to bring his
men up to the requisite fighting
pitch by the time Saturday rolls
around.
Injuries that have handicapped
the Babes in the last few games
seem to be pretty well healed up
with the important exceptions of
Mel Hurley, giant tackle, and Fred
Williams, speedy half, who will both
be lost to the team Saturday. With
good backs few and far between on
this year's yearling squad, Williams'
loss will probably be seriously felt.
More cheerful is the news that Cap
| tain Dale Beedle and Joe Yigna,
: both injured for some time, will be
on deck and ready to resume their
I early season's stellar work.
Intensive Practice
Continuing to stress fundamentals,
I Bradshaw plans to run his charges
through a series of' stiff charging
practice sessions. Impressed upon
the forwards will be the necessity
for keeping their feet, holding their
heads up and staying with the op
posing linemen until they are defi
nitely out of the play. Plard and |
snappy signal drill will also come i
for its share of attention.
