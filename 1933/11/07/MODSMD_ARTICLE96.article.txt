# Force S.C. Fresh Women To Don Green Arm Band
## 
### 
On Friday next little green arm
bands will cease to be the ties that
bind litfle green frosh women down
in the citadel of Troy. It seems that
Troy's fair sex is ruled by the dread
organization of Amazons, Trojan
women whose chief joy in life is
to subject defenseless frosh gills to
the green insignia of their humble
station.
But on November 10 the arm
band compulsion ceases to be a
compulsion and the women will
hang the hated symbols on the tra
ditional Amazon axe.
