## 
### Gray Creveling 
Back to Oakland goes the Stan
lord varsity water polo team to
clash this time with the Lakeside
Swimming Club at the Lakeside
Public Plunge tomorrow night.
Lakeside's showing against the
Olympic Club Saturday makes them
definite favorite in tomorrow's
game, and the Cards will have to
improve over their last week's form
to win. The Lakeside, Olympic
game went to two extra periods,
and then it v/as a lucky shot that

•, won for the clubmen, 9-8.
The bad scare that the Athens
Club gave Stanford last week when
it was all the Indians could do to
win by one point has been followed
by three lull hour scrimmages,
Coach Nort Thornton has not spared
the whip and the water poloists
have become serious of purpose.
"I look for another great, close
giime with the Lakesiders," Thorn
ton mused. The swimming club's
coach is A1 Kallunki who had for
] merly taught the Athens boys how
it is done. Their star, Gordon Cor
son, was the big scorer on Athens'
■ team last year.
The junior varsity will face a for
midable team of Lakeside subs in
ti:e preliminary.
California swings into action this
week, facing the Olympic Club in
J the Bear's first game.
