# STANFORD SOCCER TEAM WINDS UP PRACTICE FOR U. C. GAME TODAY
## 
### 
Taking its last practice this after
noon before the first Conference Big
Game with Cal, the soccer varsity
will scrimmage briefly in prepara
tion for tomorrow's contest with the
most powerful Bear soccer team in
recent years.
j With a chance to replace Califor
! nia at second place in the league
and to knock off S.F.U. from that
place of vantage, the Stanford men
will fight the jinx of tied games,
which has accounted for its .500 con
ference rating, as well as the Bears'
crack squad. That Stanford has
beaten Cal consistently in the past
I few years in the three-game series
j i>- no indication of victory this year.
On the contrary, the Blue and Gold
higher league standing points to a
victory for them.
Victory-Headed
j But the Cardinal team ran
smoothly against San Mateo Satur
day last and showed all the symp
toms of a victory-headed outfit.
With their strong defense of goalie,
Jack King: fullbacks, Dick Strouse
and Cy Johnson; and halfbacks,
Doug Kennedy, Rudy Gonzales, and
Waddy White, working at best they
ought to hold California. Rod
Lewis, close rival with Strouse for
| fullback, will be on hand to re
enforce that post and a number of
fine halfbacks, headed by Johnny
Hitchcock, make a strong halfback
1 line a cinch. Hitchcock, if recov
ered enough from injuries, may
Mart at left half.
The forwards, who took 26 shots
against San Mateo with phenome
nally bad luck due to their enemy
goalposts and defense, have great
potentialities. If they click a nice
i score may pile up against Cal. If
they don't click, the team might still
hold Cal to one of Stanford's string
of ties.
Moore to Start
Although Coach Harry Maloney
tried Kennedy out in yesterday's
practice at right inside, Johnnie
Moore will undoubtedly start there,
1 leaving Kennedy to his center half.

i Captain Carl Knecht, who passed,
ran, and tricked his way through
the second-string varsity yesterday,
will be the offense's strongest cog
against Cal. Center forward Art
Hearn, already responsible for most
of the Indian tallies this season, will
' get his last polishing today in prac
tice and should shine nicely tomor
row along with the rest of the for
ward line-up, Sven Doddington and
1 Mike Gomez.
I In yesterday's scrimmage Bernie
1 Kaufman came out of obscurity to
play a dandy game at goalie against
the varsity. Carl Eitner fought
away nobly at left inside and Win
j stead "Groakuss" Weaver played
nicely in co-operation with AI Na
varro. Bud Krebbs, first varsity
right wing sub, looked okeh taking
| some pretty goal shots.

Waddy White, working at best they
ought to hold California. Rod
Lewis, close rival with Strouse for
| fullback, will be on hand to re
enforce that post and a number of
fine halfbacks, headed by Johnny
Hitchcock, make a strong halfback
1 line a cinch. Hitchcock, if recov
ered enough from injuries, may
Mart at left half.
The forwards, who took 26 shots
against San Mateo with phenome
nally bad luck due to their enemy
goalposts and defense, have great
potentialities. If they click a nice
i score may pile up against Cal. If
they don't click, the team might still
hold Cal to one of Stanford's string
of ties.
Moore to Start
Although Coach Harry Maloney
tried Kennedy out in yesterday's
practice at right inside, Johnnie
Moore will undoubtedly start there,
1 leaving Kennedy to his center half.

i Captain Carl Knecht, who passed,
ran, and tricked his way through
the second-string varsity yesterday,
will be the offense's strongest cog
against Cal. Center forward Art
Hearn, already responsible for most
of the Indian tallies this season, will
' get his last polishing today in prac
tice and should shine nicely tomor
row along with the rest of the for
ward line-up, Sven Doddington and
1 Mike Gomez.
I In yesterday's scrimmage Bernie
1 Kaufman came out of obscurity to
play a dandy game at goalie against
the varsity. Carl Eitner fought
away nobly at left inside and Win
j stead "Groakuss" Weaver played
nicely in co-operation with AI Na
varro. Bud Krebbs, first varsity
right wing sub, looked okeh taking
| some pretty goal shots.
Taking its last practice this after
noon before the first Conference Big
Game with Cal, the soccer varsity
will scrimmage briefly in prepara
tion for tomorrow's contest with the
most powerful Bear soccer team in
recent years.
j With a chance to replace Califor
! nia at second place in the league
and to knock off S.F.U. from that
place of vantage, the Stanford men
will fight the jinx of tied games,
which has accounted for its .500 con
ference rating, as well as the Bears'
crack squad. That Stanford has
beaten Cal consistently in the past
I few years in the three-game series
j i>- no indication of victory this year.
On the contrary, the Blue and Gold
higher league standing points to a
victory for them.
Victory-Headed

smoothly against San Mateo Satur
day last and showed all the symp
toms of a victory-headed outfit.
