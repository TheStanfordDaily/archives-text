# Farm Students Prefer ‘Bing' to Opera Discs
## 
### FRANCES AYRES 
Not very high class—that's the
verdict on Stanford students' taste
ir music. Campus money spent on
sheet music and phonograph records
in Palo Alio music stores docs not
go for operatic gems, but for what
one of the local merchants calls
"just the popular .stuff."
Bing Crosby is at the head of the
class as far as students are con
cerned, with his "Buckin' the Wind"
and "Thanks' as the two most popu
lar songs at present. A few weeks
ago, (he inevitable "Who's Afraid of
the Big. Bad Wolf" was. most often
requested.
Men students are most susceptible

[to popular music than women, and
do the majority of the buying. They
most often ask for songs they have
heard in movies.
Students prefer good dance tunes
to sentimental songs, say the music
merchants—that is, unless they are i
in love. Then their tastes wax
1 soupy and sweet.
"But we don't, get very many love
sick ones," was added.
Other musical attributes of Stan
| fordites: crooning is the most popu
lar form of vocal expression; many
of the students come to the music
stores, looking for just the words to
tongs; and many more come just to
he ar records and never buy any.
