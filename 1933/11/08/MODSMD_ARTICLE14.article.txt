# Injured Fullback Returns To Practice Grind
## 
### Spud Hamilton 
To "Tiny" Thornhill and his squad
of varsity gridmen this week must j
be passing all too quickly, as the
days befbre the Southern California
game drop off in huge chunks. |
Bobby Grayson, who has been a |
part-time boarder at the Palo Alto j
Hospital since the Olympic Club j
game, will be out in uniform today i
with only three practice sessions!
left before the Los Angeles journey.
Hillman Subs at Fullback
In the meantime, veteran Jack
Hillman has been holding down the |
fullback's job in practice, with Ray
Todd as a new understudy to the i
position. Last night they worked !
long and hard with Todd, adding to '
a passing threat that evidently is i
expected to make yardage against j
the Trojans.
However, Frankic Alusti/.a, now i
a cinch to open the game at quar
ter, has lijecn doing the heavy
work of the passing attack. From
his position at quarter Alustiza
will throw his share of passes,
and will appear on the receiving
end as well.
The hard rock from Sacramento,
in other words Bill Sim, who en
dured a whole season of football last j
year with singularly few injuries,;
looks like the hard luck kid today, j
Nearly all year he has been handi
capped with a injured wrist, and I
in the Washington game his shoul
der went out. Last night Sim took
a hard roll on the shoulder which
.shook him up quite a bit, and made
bleacher coaches speculate on his
chances of playing a good game
Saturday.
Three Good Halfbacks
Thornhill will have a number of
men available for the left halfback's j
position, among whom Bob Maentz,
Bill Sim, and Johnny Heisner ought
to be the leading lights. These three j
worthies are now all in a slightly ;
bedraggled condition, with Sim
probably in the best physical shape,
which itself is none too good.
Reisncr has his broken ribs bound
up with a lot of tape until he re
sembles nothing less than a barrel,
and Maentz has just this week re
turned to active practice and is
treading a big gingerly on a weak
ankle. Of course, Buck Van Dellen
and Sheldon Bronstein are a couple
of good men, but they lack the ex
i perience.
Backfield Possibility
A mighty sweet backfield could
be started which includes Grayson
i at full, Alustiza hr quarter, Maentz
and Hamilton, halfbacks. With thai,
i set-up you have four really triple
threat backs, with every man a good
1 passer, kicker, or ball-carrier. The
weakest point would be Grayson's
kicking. Hamilton, Alusliza, and
Maentz are all good punters.
Hillman at full, and Sim at left
half would not detract from thai
triple threat motif. Sim is a good
quick kicker although he is no great
shakes at the passing ait. Hillman
is as good as any passer on the
team, and he can kick.
In anticipation of a hard driving
<<ttack coupled with speedy thrusts
and passes, Coach Howard Jones
j prepared more defensive drill for
his University of Southern Califor
j niu squad today in anticipation of
the Stanford Indians who go on the
J warpath here Saturday, said the As
| sedated Press last night,
j "Stanford has a good team," Jones
! said after his personal observation
! tour Saturday. "I have seldom seen
| a better blocking back than Hamil
j ton nor a shiftier or speedier runner
! than Grayson; they make a great
pair and are always dangerous.
