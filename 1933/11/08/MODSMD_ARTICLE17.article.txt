# ARID CAMPUS WATCHES NATION SCRAP DRY LAW
## Voters of Three States Join Wet Parade; Farm Leaders Split On Issue Stanford, Palo Alto Will Be Only Volstead Refuges On Flooded Peninsula 
### Dave Mellinkoff 
Early this morning the spirit of,
Neal Dow, great granddaddy of ;
American prohibition, was slowly
sinking to a liquorous grave. The
flowing white beard was tinged with
the purple of California wines; a
withered hand clutched in despera
tion Stanford's spotless escutcheon;
a cracking voice cheered: "Thank
God for Palo Alto!"
While John Barleycorn rocked
with drunken laughter, took a nip
of "red sauterne" down the Menlo j
road, stopped for a "boilermaker" j
at Cal's, and doffed his derby to the
barkeep at Mangini's, the Volstead
family tree fastened itself more
firmly into a California Penal Code
which forbids the sale of intoxicat
ing liquor within a mile and one
half of the Farm.
Present Restrictions
Anti-salooners felt half-safe, half
soused on the mid-peninsula desert
isle. The situation was varied:
CAMPUS: Still bone dry. Stu
dents more or less soberly re
flected on A.S.S.U. and Board of
Trustees bans on intoxicants,
queer meaning in the faec of
dripping repeal from San Fran
cisco to the Sandstone Gates. The
ominous action:
"The Academic Council is re
quested to prohibit the use of li
, quors in fraternity chapter houses,
1 student clubhouses, and other lodg
ings. This prohibition extends to all
: student lodgings whether on the
j campus or elsewhere.
"The University assumes that the
i act of registering of students implies
I full acceptance of this policy."
PALO ALTO: Delightfully dry. 1
1 Cafes were still serving up an oc

! Eastside.
i MEN L O: Officially, obliging
! lawmakers were considering a
| special ordinance allowing sale of
| wines and other liquors before the
end of the month's constitutional
delay. Unofficially, drinks were
' plentiful.
1 REDWOOD CITY: Plans were
being formulated for a proposed
municipal dispensary of hard li
quors. Sentiment overwhelmingly
wet.
SAN FRANCISCO: Everybody
happy, literally and figuratively. Ho
tels featured repeal celebrations.
Such was repeal. Red-nosed Bar
leycorn was gleeful; Stanfordians
were on the see-saw; Dow's cries
] were gradually being reduced to in
coherent burblings as the irresista
bie tide swept onward.

Anti-salooners felt half-safe, half
soused on the mid-peninsula desert
isle. The situation was varied:
CAMPUS: Still bone dry. Stu
dents more or less soberly re
flected on A.S.S.U. and Board of
Trustees bans on intoxicants,
queer meaning in the faec of
dripping repeal from San Fran
cisco to the Sandstone Gates. The
ominous action:
"The Academic Council is re
quested to prohibit the use of li
, quors in fraternity chapter houses,
1 student clubhouses, and other lodg
ings. This prohibition extends to all
: student lodgings whether on the
j campus or elsewhere.
"The University assumes that the

Early this morning the spirit of,
Neal Dow, great granddaddy of ;
American prohibition, was slowly
sinking to a liquorous grave. The
flowing white beard was tinged with
the purple of California wines; a
withered hand clutched in despera
tion Stanford's spotless escutcheon;
a cracking voice cheered: "Thank
God for Palo Alto!"
While John Barleycorn rocked
with drunken laughter, took a nip
of "red sauterne" down the Menlo j
