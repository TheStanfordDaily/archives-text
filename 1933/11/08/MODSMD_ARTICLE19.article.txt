## Wilbur Refuses Comment On New Conditions 
### Frank Orr 
While thirsty Americans the na
tion over drowned their sorrows in
a newly-loosed torrent of liquor last
night, student leaders and faculty
members differed in their concept j
of the result of prohibition repeal, j
Many refused to comment; others
spoke freely their views on the'
question.
"I would rather not discuss the
matter," replied President Ray '
Lyman Wilbur when asked his
opinion on results of prohibition
repeal.
Said Dean of Men George Bliss
Culver: "I'm no prophet on such
matters, but conditions would seem
to indicate the quick return of the 1
saloon in not very different form!
than before."

Prohibition for Paly
H. A. Zink, chief of Palo Alto
police, declared last night, "As to
tiie local effects of prohibition re
peal, I will be bound by the ruling
of the city attorney. Nationally, I
still think there will always be a
necessity for local option. There are
some communities where prohibition
will always be a necessity. Repeal
of the state law was in my opinion
! n grave mistake."
Sounding a note of caution, Po
litical Science Professor Walter
Thompson warned: "Prohibition re

official notification by state conven

tor the state legislatures to handle
their own enforcement acts. There
