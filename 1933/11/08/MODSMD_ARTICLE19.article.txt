# Chiefs Air Stands on Repeal Act
## Wilbur Refuses Comment On New Conditions 
### Frank Orr 
While thirsty Americans the na
tion over drowned their sorrows in
a newly-loosed torrent of liquor last
night, student leaders and faculty
members differed in their concept j
of the result of prohibition repeal, j
Many refused to comment; others
spoke freely their views on the'
question.
"I would rather not discuss the
matter," replied President Ray '
Lyman Wilbur when asked his
opinion on results of prohibition
repeal.
Said Dean of Men George Bliss
Culver: "I'm no prophet on such
matters, but conditions would seem
to indicate the quick return of the 1
saloon in not very different form!
than before."
Optimistic in tone were many of
the comments, typical that of Ernie
Arbuckle, Men's Council chairman: 1
"1 think it's a grand thing. It seems ;
obvious that the eighteenth amend- !
ment did more to repress temperance j
than to repress drinking. Now that J
it is repealed I think there will be
less drinking than before."
"Nothing to Say"
Dean Mary Yost, Dr. Robert E. 1
Swain, Chaplain David Charles I
Gardner, A.S.S.U. President Jerry
Trautman conservatively declined to j
comment on the wet vote.

quor-lacking by University charter,!
will abide by City Attorney Arnold
Rumwell's decision, say police. The
attorney's decision, released yester- !
day, declares it "unlawful to sell or (
deal in intoxicating liquors within!
(he city of Palo Alto," regardless of .
ihe repeal of the eighteenth amend
ment and the coming into operation |
'of Ihe new state law.
Prohibition for Paly
H. A. Zink, chief of Palo Alto
police, declared last night, "As to
tiie local effects of prohibition re
peal, I will be bound by the ruling
of the city attorney. Nationally, I
still think there will always be a
necessity for local option. There are
some communities where prohibition
will always be a necessity. Repeal
of the state law was in my opinion
! n grave mistake."
Sounding a note of caution, Po
litical Science Professor Walter
Thompson warned: "Prohibition re
peal will have no effect until the
official notification by state conven
tions. Then it wiil be a problem
tor the state legislatures to handle
their own enforcement acts. There
are still many, local regulations, as
well as provisions in federal statutes
prohibiting the sending of liquor
into dry territory. Conditions of the
next few months will be indeed
chaotic."
"Beer and wine taken in mod
eration with meals are far more
Itenefieial than some of the pow
erful coffee that Americans in
dulge in," dryly commented earn
est-voiced Edward M. Hulmc,
professor of history.
'"If Americans cannot learn to
drink in a civilized manner like the
people of Mediterranean countries,"
Hulme said, "they should be
ashamed of themselves, but I think
liquor will have a beneficial effect
on the lives of intelligent and rea
sonable people. 1 think the repeal
of prohibition is beneficial in that it
will remove a bitterly disputed
question or at least relegate it to a
very subordinate position. We may
therefore expect national legislation
to be more intelligent and effective,"
he concluded.

Prohibition for Paly
H. A. Zink, chief of Palo Alto

tiie local effects of prohibition re
peal, I will be bound by the ruling
of the city attorney. Nationally, I
still think there will always be a
necessity for local option. There are
some communities where prohibition
will always be a necessity. Repeal
of the state law was in my opinion
! n grave mistake."
Sounding a note of caution, Po
litical Science Professor Walter
Thompson warned: "Prohibition re
peal will have no effect until the
official notification by state conven
tions. Then it wiil be a problem
tor the state legislatures to handle
their own enforcement acts. There
are still many, local regulations, as
well as provisions in federal statutes
prohibiting the sending of liquor
into dry territory. Conditions of the
next few months will be indeed
chaotic."
"Beer and wine taken in mod
eration with meals are far more

'"If Americans cannot learn to
drink in a civilized manner like the
people of Mediterranean countries,"
Hulme said, "they should be
ashamed of themselves, but I think
liquor will have a beneficial effect
on the lives of intelligent and rea

of prohibition is beneficial in that it
will remove a bitterly disputed
question or at least relegate it to a
very subordinate position. We may
therefore expect national legislation
