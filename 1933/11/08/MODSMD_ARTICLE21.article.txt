# School of Engineering Gets Photostat, Rooms
## 
### JACK NEWMAN 
A new photostat is what causes
the hammering, ditch-digging, and
pick-axeing that is going on in the
usually inconspicuous ;ill>'y between
the Engineering and Press Build
ings. And ;i new photostat, being a
king of camera th.it duplicates blue
prints and geological maps, is what
tiit- Engineering Department needs
to replace its old one, worn out after
several decades of Stanford techni
cians.
While the installation of the ma-

chine is going on, largo Engineering
office is being remodeled into several
smaller ones. The loft chamber will
l>e made into a drafting room to be
used by University Engineer J. W.
McDonnell's associates.
Engineers, dislodged from their
desks by the remodeling activities,
are now working at improvised
tables in the power station building.
Their temporary removal will be up
in about two weeks when the build
ing with its photostat will be ready
for occupancy.
