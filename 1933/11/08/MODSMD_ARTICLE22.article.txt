# John Barleycorn Back In Saddle; “Demon Rum" Becomes Legal
## BOTH CAROLINAS DRY San Francisco Turns Out To Welcome Repeal 
### Jay Graves 
John Barleycorn—favorite be
nevolent despot of a hundred ten
million Americans re-ascended to
his throne last night after exile of
13 years.
From sassaparilla to three-point -
two, and from Roosevelt beer to
Manhattan cocktails, four more
states of the "indivisable union"
joined their 33 sisters in the march
toward gin fizzes and highballs.
Pennsylvania was voting 8 to 1 in
Philadelphia and 4 to 1 over the rest
of the state, Ohio repeal majority
was well over 700,000; Utah was
wet 3 to 2, Kentucky, home of the
moonshiners, opens its ballot boxes
today, but voting frenzy was high
enough to kill four people in gun
battles.
Two States Dry
It was curiously paradoxical that
the first defeats suffered by the
Twenty-Frist Amendment should
have come on the same day that
Repeal and Bacchus won their 13-
year battle for re-instatement.
The Carolines, traditionally dry,
reinaired so to the bitter end.
North Carolina upheld the prin
ciples of the Anti-Saloon League
2 to 1 South Carolina: the same
by a slim but decisive margin.
Rain and occasional snow flurries
marked the balloting hours in Ohio
and Pennsylvania, btft a-V-nvy vote,
in Ohio considerably in excess" of
2,000,000, was recorded.
S.F. Celebrates
San Franciscans turned out in
large crowds to celebrate the demise
of Volstead, as liquor, not sanctioned
by Webb, flowed freely. No such
hilarity as greeted beer, though.
New York's 32,000 speakeasies
will now have to get licenses and
'•go leg?i." Manhattan night life
sophisticates will still talk about
tlie "good old days," but now they
will mean dingy Bowery hide
ways. and "300" clubs, with cham
pagne(?) at $25 a quart.
Repeal brings Chicago a kind of
liquor it has almost forgotten dur
ing the past decade—a change from
"Canadian"' booze distilled in Cicero
by A1 Capone, "Bugs" Moran, and
i other underworld beer barons who
' built fabulous fortunes out of syn
thetic gin (only to be jailed for non
payment of income tax).
Three Billion Lost
Desert years, in lost revenues and
enforcement, cost the U.S. three bil
lion dollars, government fiscal ex
perts estimated.
President Wilson vetoed the Vol
|stead act. At. the time he observed:
"The morals of a great cosmopolitan
people cannot be regulated by re
j.strictions. All such attempts must
end in failure."
Thirteen years' controversy proved
bis observation true. The W.C.T.U.
is "temporarily" defeated. Now the
74th Congress, convening in Decem
ber, will light over how high the
| tax will be.
An extremely high liquor tax
might nullify the expected good
which repeal might bring.
