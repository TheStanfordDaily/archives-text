# The 						Wet Wave Has Broken

### 
f.asl night, tlie reputed reign of blue-nosed, blaek-caped
Prohilytion ended. For some (en years, this gaunt figure
lias siit on its throne and said, "You shall not drink alco
holic beverages." Hut the people have listened not, have
drunk.
And now, the dry straw monarch has been deposed.
When the formalities of his burial have been attended to,
I lie majority will go on doing legally what they have been
doing illegally.
The reasons advanced for the overthrow of this King
of supersnoopcrs were appealing, but like most appealing
t'tings, without basis. A mark on a piece of paper will not
eliminate one gangster; the same mark multiplied some 10
million times or more will not end gangsterism. The crim
inal menace is with us still. The foothold that Prohibition
gave them may be gone, but they are now beyond the foot
hold stage; they are comfortably seated in the armchairs
of wealth and political power. They will merely shift their
field of operations from liquor to racketeering, kidnapping,
and other lucrative enterprises.
The mathematical calculations that showed that liquor
would not only end governmental deficits but restore pros
perity as well are highly questionable. Some revenue will
result; but if myopic legislators attempt to dissolve all
problems of public finance in alcohol, the bootlegger will
once more knock at the American door. Few people object
to drinking illegal liquor; all object to drinking too ex
pensive liquor. The price must be kept low if the boot
legger is to be kept out of business.
Some men will be put to work by the twenty-first
amendment, but many will be put out. The thousands of
speakeasy employees are part of the national economy;
all of the Toms, Harrys, and Louies, of "ask for Tom,"
"ask for Harry," etc., fame will be put out of business or
be forced into another business. The economic benefits of
freer and easier liquor are largely psychological; and the
reliance that can be placed on psychology has been proved
during the dark years behind us.
Hut tonight is memorable still for if marks the end of a
mpveineirt thai sought to dictate personal tastes by politi
cal vote. The majority is only right because it declares it
self right. The tyranny of the majority is one of the most
cutting, the most dangerous. In a Democracy, we count
noses to decide questions; that seems necessary in ques
tions of general policy. Hut the idea that a majority can
dictate a personal matter has now been definitely killed,
the interment will soon follow.

gave them may be gone, but they are now beyond the foot
hold stage; they are comfortably seated in the armchairs
of wealth and political power. They will merely shift their
field of operations from liquor to racketeering, kidnapping,
and other lucrative enterprises.
The mathematical calculations that showed that liquor
would not only end governmental deficits but restore pros

result; but if myopic legislators attempt to dissolve all
problems of public finance in alcohol, the bootlegger will
once more knock at the American door. Few people object
to drinking illegal liquor; all object to drinking too ex
pensive liquor. The price must be kept low if the boot

Some men will be put to work by the twenty-first
amendment, but many will be put out. The thousands of
speakeasy employees are part of the national economy;
all of the Toms, Harrys, and Louies, of "ask for Tom,"
"ask for Harry," etc., fame will be put out of business or
be forced into another business. The economic benefits of
freer and easier liquor are largely psychological; and the
reliance that can be placed on psychology has been proved

dictate a personal matter has now been definitely killed,
the interment will soon follow.
f.asl night, tlie reputed reign of blue-nosed, blaek-caped
Prohilytion ended. For some (en years, this gaunt figure
lias siit on its throne and said, "You shall not drink alco
holic beverages." Hut the people have listened not, have
drunk.
And now, the dry straw monarch has been deposed.
When the formalities of his burial have been attended to,
I lie majority will go on doing legally what they have been
doing illegally.
The reasons advanced for the overthrow of this King
of supersnoopcrs were appealing, but like most appealing
t'tings, without basis. A mark on a piece of paper will not
