# "Dear Editor—”
## 
### 
Have you any pet theory, any grieve, gripe, or sugges
lion? 11' so, run (don't walk) to the nearest typewriter, sel
forth your ideas, dispatch them to the Editor, and soon
your efforts at defacing white paper will he set forth in
print in the columns of the. /)aily.
The ('.ampus Opinion column has heretofore been open
< nly lo students and faculty members who signed their
names to tiie letters. A new policy is inaugurated today.
Campus Opinion letters may be anonymous in print, pro
viding that the Daily is given the name and address of
the writer in confidence.
The Daily will print all letters whose writers are will
ing lo have their names printed. We will use our discre
tion regarding those letters whose writers wish to appear
unknown.
Let the bricks and bouquets fall where thev may. We
hope the Daily's average of letters received surpasses that
of President Roosevelt and Marlene Dietrich, perhaps even
of Ilex the Wonder Horse.
