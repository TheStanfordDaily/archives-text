Xow, boysics and girlsies, we crave your indulgence on
a little matter which makes us look like a bunch of saps.
It deals with a common practice among hayseeds paying,
their lirst visit to a big city and getting stiff necks from 1
looking at tall buildings.
The tall building in this instance is in reality a human ;
being, Howard Jones, coach of University of Southern Cali
fornia's football team. Mr. Jones has earned his right to j
be compared lo a tall building because of the fancy work
he has done in recent years, winning games with such con- |
sistcncy that local studes almost regard him as a myth.
Myther Jones sal in the stadium press box here Satur- I
day, watching Tiny Thornhill make replacements in a
wobbling Red Machine and gradually perfecting the tim
ing. Finally, the old chugger chugged down to a touch
down. And what did each little hoysie and girlsie in the
tooling section do but turn around and gawk just like
Rube Nipple from Mosquito Rend visiting his cousin in 1
(Jiieaggi!
Jones did the sensible thing. He appeared to be oblivi
ous of the tinhorns who by their actions admitted that they J
thought Stanford was far below I'.S.C. Among other things
which we attend this institution for is to get some savoir-!
faire. It is not considered polite nor metropolitan to stare
at people. And what's more, Jones is a gentleman.
