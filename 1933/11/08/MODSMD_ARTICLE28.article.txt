HAILING THE "21"
I
The Editor, Sir:
The Daily for October 13 reports 1
that the Executive Committee is
planning an Axe Ceremony after the
Big Game. This action is appropriate
for such an occasion, but they have
apparently entirely overlooked the 1
fact tfrat several members of the
Twenty-One are still in school.
Nearly all of the remaining members
' of this group reside near the Uni- ;
versity and will undoubtedly attend '
the game.
For the benefit of those who do
I not know about the Twenty-One,
let me state that they were the body ;
I of Stanford students who recovered
the Axe on April 3, 1930, after thus
j object of Stanford-California rivalry
' had lain securely in Berkeley for j
j some 30 years.
It does not seem proper to mo.
that these students who returned
the Axe in 1930 should be so soon
' forgotten. Many of the Twenty-One
i tried to retake the Axe for several
; years before they were successful.
Although I realize that fame is fleet-
I ing, the Axemen should not be thus
j overlooked in favor of men who
probably have never even seen the

Axe.
The Executive Committee could
more appropriately have the Axe
men of 1930 be Ihe Axemen of 1933
in escorting the Stanford Axe to the
! middle of the field at the conclusion
lof the Big Game. Let the honor
i and glory go to those who have
I earned it. Who is better entitled to
j it? We ought not to begrudge them
i this last token of appreciation.
Thank you,
Allan H. McCurdy, '31
