LE COQ D'OU (Rimsk.v-Korsakoff)
War Memorial Opera House
A remarkable, enchanting beauty
was achieved in the production
Monday night of Rimsky-Korsakoff's
dazzling and fantastic opera-panto
mine. The artistry of the staging
blended poetic imagination with a
gaiety of humor that one does not
find in Pushkin's fairy tale, but
which greatly enlivened the dra
matic spirit of the opera.
Enough credit can hardly be given
io Adolph Boim for his dii'ection.
His originality graced every group
i ig, every gesture, every rhythmic
accent of his excellently-trained bal
let corps, and he missed no oppor
tunities for heightening the colorful
exaggeration of the story-r-notably
in the final procession. His charac
terization of King Dodon, too, was
; varied and richly comic. In the ex
j quisite "Hymn to the gun" scene he
i was aided by the graceful dancing
of Maclovia Ruiz as Queen She
jmaka; they built the second act to
la climax of delicate, witty charm.
The entire cast of pantofnimists

was excellent, and the singers—al
though seated a little too far out of
lange at the sides—performed ad
mirably, with Emily Hardy and Na
than Stewart outstanding for their
work. The pictorial beauty of the
staging was the creation of Nicholas
RemisoiT, whose vivid decorative
settings and costumes were as start
ling as they were effective. Gener
ally fine lighting emphasized the
unreal quality of the brilliant de
signs.
It was a memorably delightful,
artistic performance, which recre
ated something of the traditional
brilliance of the Imperial Russian
