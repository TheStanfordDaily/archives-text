# CARDS UNDERDOGS AS SOCCER TEAM MEETS CAL TODAY
## 
### Waddy White 
Stanford first - string soccermen
meet the powerful California var
si'y this afternoon at 3:45 o'clock in j
the first big game of the three - gam e j
series, beginning the hour-and-a- j
half battle early in order to avoid
Iho difficulties and dangers of noc
turnal scrimmaging.
A scrimmage and brief chalk talk
crammed into yesterday's short j
practice put the finishing touches on
the Indian squad, preparing the
kickers for their hardest game. Fac
ing a strong Blue and Gold team
which stands one notch above Stan
ford's .500 Conference third-place!
ranking, the Cards will not be fa
vored to win.
Chance for Second Place
But if they click in the forward j
line and hold in the defense, the j
Redmen may replace Cal at second
place, the championship being obtain
able from there bv defeating S.F.U.
T1 :at they will click today is not :
such a remote possibility. In prac- !
tiee yesterday, however, they did'
not shine. The forward line, which
took 26 shots against San Mateo j
It-si Saturday to score one goal, will
need its best playing to take Cali
fornia into camp. There is a super
abundance of power in the line-up:
Captain Carl Knecht, left wing; j
Mike Gomez, left inside; Art Hearn,
center forward; John Moore, right;
inside; and Sven Doddington, right 1
wing. Injuries to Knecht and Moore j
may handicap their fiery offensive j
play.
Where the competition has been;
greatest, in the halfback line, the'
strength is possibly greatest. Doug!
Kennedy ties together the two out
post half, Rudy Gonzales at right |
unci Wacldy White at left, with a big
stride and clever aerial and ground |
kicking. The halfbacks should be
able to hold the Bears if they are
at their best. If not, Johnny Hitch- '
cock will be inserted at. left and
add his burly, wreckless aggressive
ness to the midfield forces.
Usual Backficld Defense
The usual backfield defense will
comprise fullbacks Cy Johnson and
Dick Strouse and goalie Jack King. \
King has possibilities as all-Con
foronce goal-guard for this season
and will undoubtedly be the most J
reliable and spectacular of tomor
row's goalies. In the event that the (
game runs over into the darkness t
too much, Milt Newman may replace
King as Newman's eyesight is supe
lior under these conditions and his
play is also good.
With the field good, the full hour
and a half game being played, and ;
feeling high, this afternoon's con- :
test, may make seme demand upon ;
thi reserves. Bud Krebbs, Chuck
Emerick, and Winstead '"Betty"
Weaver may see action in the for
ward line; Hitchcock may get in at
half; and Rod Lewis may play at
fullback.
