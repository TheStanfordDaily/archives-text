# FRESHMEN WORK ON FUNDAMENTALS FOR U.G. GRIDFEST
## 
### Charles Chappell 
Continuing their pre-Little Big
game preparations, the Stanford
l'rosh spent last night's practice ses
sion in charging practice and in a
strenuous signal-running workout.
Dotted around over the field were
groups of two linemen, working at
the business of charging each other
out of the way.
Knowing that it will take a team
well-drilled in fundamentals to up
set California, Coach Jimmie Brad
shaw will continue to stress these
more mundane aspects of football
for the balance of the week.
Run Signals
After the charging drill, signal
running came in for its share of
attention. No lethargic going through
the motions was enough to satisfy
the yearlings' energetic coach. Line
men and backs were forced to run
through the plays as if they meant
business, with an eye ever-turned
toward Saturday's season-climaxing
battle.
Working on the A team were
Chouteau and Elder, ends; Bee
die and Tsoutsouvas, tackles;
Spennetta and Gcisen, guards;
Quails, center; Vigna, quarter
hack; Brent, right half; Walton,
left half; and Ledbettcr at full
back.
With Schott absent frqm practice,
Elder was moved up to the first
string flank position. Jack Walton,
Starting the season at guard, has
been shifted to the left half post.
Fairly speedy despite his 200-some
odd pounds, Walton is expected to
bolster the backfield's defensive
play. Some experience at fullback
in high school is expected to help
him in getting used to his new
duties.
Spennetta at Guard
Paul Spennetta, who has already
seen considerable action this year,
takes over the first-string guard
post. Joe Vigna, out for some time
with an injured knee, was barking
out signals in his capable early sea
son manner. Ralph Quails, alter
nating at center through the season
with George Bergman, seems to
have the edge over his rival at this
stage of the game.
Provided the Stanford Babes can
be brought up to their early season
potentialities, Coach Bradshaw feels
that his charges are quite capable
of upsetting their trans-bay rivals
in Saturday's game. Set as models
for the Little Big Game were the
performances turned in by the team
against San Mateo J.C. and the S.C.
i'rosh. The Indians nosed out the
powerful Jaysee eleven 7 to 6 and
came within an ace of upsetting the
Trobabes.
