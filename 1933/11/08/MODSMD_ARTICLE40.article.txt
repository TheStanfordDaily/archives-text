Champions Phi Kappa Sigma lost
their first game yesterday afternoon
6 to 0 to El Campo in a hard-fought,
rough scrimmage.

on one of these runs and Pascal

the Phi Kap special but had little
success in advancing the ball far
into El Campo territory. A1 Ander
son did the Phi Kappa passing with
Jack Davant and Dan Dana, the re
ceiving.

knocking down his passes; one com
pleted to Tom Morgan was run to
a touchdown, however. Another

a blocked kick for the third touch
down. Two of the touchdowns were
converted.
