Champions Phi Kappa Sigma lost
their first game yesterday afternoon
6 to 0 to El Campo in a hard-fought,
rough scrimmage.
Campois Milo Tally and Herbert
Sanderson ran the champions ragged
on long sweeping end runs. Tally
placed the ball on the 1-yard line
on one of these runs and Pascal
Goodrich bucked over for the only
score.
Phi Kap Passes Fail
Completion of short passes was
the Phi Kap special but had little
success in advancing the ball far
into El Campo territory. A1 Ander
son did the Phi Kappa passing with
Jack Davant and Dan Dana, the re
ceiving.
The tie in League VII was broken
yesterday when the Betas won over
Phi Delta Theta, 20 to 0.
Betas Smother Phi Delts
Dick Giddings kept the Phi Delts
busy stopping his long runs and
knocking down his passes; one com
pleted to Tom Morgan was run to
a touchdown, however. Another
pass from Eliot Blanchard to Bud
Sophian was good for six more
points, and Frank Ingersoll fell on
a blocked kick for the third touch
down. Two of the touchdowns were
converted.
Phi Delta Phi won their first game
in three trys from Sequoia II, 26
to 0. Ferdinand Fletcher ran 50
yards, Tudor Scripps caught a pass
from Walter Craig, Fletcher passed
to Akeley Quirk twice, for the four
touchdowns, two of which were con
verted.
Phi Psi's Nosed Out
The most evenly matched teams
playing were Sequoia I and Phi Psi,
the former winning by two points
in an extra period. The end of the
regular period saw Phi Psi with the
ball on the Sequoia 20-yard line.
From the 50-yard line in the play
off, Bill Ladue carried the ball on
a series of runs to the Phi Psi 10-
yard marker, where it remained,
[John Mottram throwing two ineom
pleted passes for Phi Psi.
Dean Foote scored six points for
El Cuadro against Menlo Juniors,
with Jack Horton converting. The
game was slow, marked by many in
tercepted passes.
