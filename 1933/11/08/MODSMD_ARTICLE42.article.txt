## NO APOLOGY FOR FOOTBALL 
### 
Some smart lad has finally figured
out that long Daily football stories'
are "baloney," being merely •re
hashes of what happened last week
and what may happen next week,
the product of puerile imaginations
and written for the edification of
no one. Well, so be it. We have
shivered in our boots for many
weeks, awaiting the clay when the
secret was out.
Personally, we are surfeited with
the usual fajl quarter abundance of
football criticism. If one-tenth the
energy given to its production were
applied to a criticism of politics, re
ligion, legislation, and the abolition
of war it would be much more per
tinent and much more useful.
After all, football is not a fun
damental aspect of life, and there
are a good many subjects more
suitable for reformers and sadists
in the plying of their respective
trades. Let them have at these
more difficult targets and give
comparatively inoffensive King
Football a rest. His is not an em
pire, it is a patch of green grass
in the desert of "civilization."
In fact, we are prone to consider
some of these lesser facts of life as
being the most worthwhile. To us,
a football game is an aesthetic ex
perience, comparable to Duke El
lington's jazz music, Ernest Hem
mingway's stories, Olaf's hamburgers
and a quart of lager, or a lazy spring
afternoon.
The real footbail conoisseur cares
not a great deal who wins the game.
He is interested in the totality of
the thing, if you get what I mean.
We shall be sitting (we hope) in the
Coliseum next Saturday afternoon
and we shall be there to see what
Howard Jones and "Tiny" Thornhill
can do with 22 men, just as we might*
go to hear what Dobrowen or Tos
canini or Stowkowski can do with
four times that number and the New
World Symphony.
There are a lot of things that
are not ideal in football; it is our
contention that the percentage is
less than it is in business, in news
papers, in education, or most any
thing.
Unfortunately football must be fi
nanced, good material must be fer
reted out, and after it is lined up it
must be well trained. Occasionally
the old ballyhoo is necessary, some
times the glamour is a bit forced
and"the shoddy shines through the
tinsel. But this is true of more things

than football.
Here on the "Stanford campus we
do not believe anyone can consci
entiously call football over-empha
sized; A man may spend equally as
much or more time in college jour
nalism) dramatics, debating, or stu
dent government. All these things
arc wholesome enough!, and a neces
sary part of life, but they are not
art, and there is where the football
team has the advantage. For some
times, not always, mind you, but
sometimes a football game becomes
an artistic experience.
And that is what makes it all
worth while. —Hamilton

Howard Jones and "Tiny" Thornhill
can do with 22 men, just as we might*

There are a lot of things that
are not ideal in football; it is our
contention that the percentage is
less than it is in business, in news
papers, in education, or most any
thing.
Unfortunately football must be fi
nanced, good material must be fer
reted out, and after it is lined up it
must be well trained. Occasionally
the old ballyhoo is necessary, some
times the glamour is a bit forced
and"the shoddy shines through the
tinsel. But this is true of more things

than football.
Here on the "Stanford campus we
do not believe anyone can consci
entiously call football over-empha
sized; A man may spend equally as
much or more time in college jour
nalism) dramatics, debating, or stu
dent government. All these things
arc wholesome enough!, and a neces
sary part of life, but they are not
art, and there is where the football
team has the advantage. For some
times, not always, mind you, but
sometimes a football game becomes
an artistic experience.
And that is what makes it all
worth while. —Hamilton
Some smart lad has finally figured
out that long Daily football stories'
are "baloney," being merely •re
hashes of what happened last week
and what may happen next week,
the product of puerile imaginations
and written for the edification of
no one. Well, so be it. We have
shivered in our boots for many
weeks, awaiting the clay when the
secret was out.
Personally, we are surfeited with
the usual fajl quarter abundance of
football criticism. If one-tenth the
energy given to its production were
applied to a criticism of politics, re
ligion, legislation, and the abolition
of war it would be much more per
tinent and much more useful.
After all, football is not a fun
damental aspect of life, and there
are a good many subjects more
suitable for reformers and sadists
in the plying of their respective
trades. Let them have at these
more difficult targets and give
comparatively inoffensive King
Football a rest. His is not an em
pire, it is a patch of green grass
in the desert of "civilization."
In fact, we are prone to consider
some of these lesser facts of life as
being the most worthwhile. To us,
a football game is an aesthetic ex
perience, comparable to Duke El
lington's jazz music, Ernest Hem
mingway's stories, Olaf's hamburgers
and a quart of lager, or a lazy spring
afternoon.
The real footbail conoisseur cares
not a great deal who wins the game.
He is interested in the totality of
the thing, if you get what I mean.
We shall be sitting (we hope) in the
Coliseum next Saturday afternoon
and we shall be there to see what
Howard Jones and "Tiny" Thornhill
can do with 22 men, just as we might*
