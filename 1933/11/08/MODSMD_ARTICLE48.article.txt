# THORNTON SHIFTS STARTING WATER POLOISTS' LINE-UP
## 
### Gray Creveling 
Dissatisfied with his water polo
j tram's showing against the Athens
Club, Coach Nort Thornton shakes
the whole team line-up for the game
tonight with the Lakeside Swimming
Club at Oakland.
Wally Wiget will replace Vlad
i Taranik at guard, Taranik having
' been shifted to forward. Sophomore
j Bill Woodard starts at center back,'
i filling Wiget's shoes.
Benet at Sprint
Jimmy Benet goes to sprint and
Bob Foster will begin the game at
right forward. Captain Graves re
mains steadfast at his guard posi- j
I lion on the left side of the wall.
Taking no chances with Leo ;
j Cook's pulled tendon, Thornton will j
| start quivering Kenny Livingston in
II he cage. Livingston's fine stops'
! while playing in the Athens game
j have marked him as another good
j goalie on whom Thornton can rely
I when "good old Leo" is injured.
Use Hungarian Style
Lakeside's .squad plays the same
(system that Stanford uses—the fast j
breaking Hungarian style. Their j
Gordon Corson leads the attack and !
finds himself the center of the Card's 1
worry.
Definite favorites to win to
night's contest, Lakesiders hope to
live up to expectations by trim
ming the Indians. The swimming
club was so good last Saturday
that they forced the Olympic Club
into two extra periods only to
have the Winged O's make a goal
by a lucky long shot as the sec
ond overtime bracket was about
over.
Hoping that his "number of
changes to strengthen the defense"
really click, Coach Thornton sends
his team into the Lakeside Public
Piunge with considerably less con- i
fidence than with which he sent his
squad against the Athens gang.
J.V.'s Play Preliminary

polo team faces a strong squad of
Lakeside subs in the preliminary;
game to begin at 8:30 o'clock.
Team members making the trip

at 6:45 o'clock and travel up to Oak
land via bus.
