# FRATERNITY BOARD TO BEGIN CONTROL OF ROW FINANCES
## 
### 
With Ihe Finance Committee of the
Interfraternity Board of Control
making final arrangements at its
meeting last night, the Board started
this week centrally controlling all
fraternity finances.
Under the plan, adopted at the
Board meeting last week, Warren
M Turner, '21, has been appointed
general fraternity auditor for the
coming academic year. He will work
under the direction of the Board.
In order to meet the expenses in
curred by this additional work of
the Interfraternity Board, each house
will pay $9 Interfraternity Council
dues each month. This will include
former Interfraternity dues, will
pay for the freshman pledging law
yer and for other Interfraternity
Beard and council expenses, as well
as providing the necessary funds for
auditing and supervising the ac
counts of each house.
Interfraternity leaders have ex
pressed hopes that by means of this
new activity of the Board, which
will include assistance being given
to the houses in collection of bills,
fraternity finances will be put on
an even â€¢ sounder basis than they
have been in the past.
