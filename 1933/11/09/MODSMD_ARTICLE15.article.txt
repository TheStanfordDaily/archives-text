# INDIAN HOPES RISE FOR WIN OVER TROJANS
## Grayson Back in Practice; Hillman Probably To Start Game 
### Oliver Johnston, Jr 
Hopes for a victory over the Thun- j
dering Herd from Troy, which have |
been dwindling all week, were re- '
vived this afternoon by Bobby Gray
son's return to practicei
Grayson ran through signal drill,
not seemingly bothered by his bad j
leg. Jack Hillman continued to run !
at first string which probably means i
:hat he will start down south. De- !
j fensivcly the team will be just as j
(strong with Hillman in, but he lacks |
(he speed of Grayson on the offense.
Thornhill and No vers are counting
! heavily on Grayson's speed to break
! him into the open around the end
more than through the line. When
Grayson once gets into the clear his
! high knee action makes him the
1 hardest man on the squad to bring

down.
Hamilton Returns
Bones Hamilton's return to the j
line-up last Saturday gave Grayson |
his opportunity to break loose. Ham- j
ilton does not stop at taking one j
man out of (he play but keeps his |
feet and is always in a position to j
protect the ball-carriers.
The goofs turned traitors last night j.
and ran Trojan plays against the
first three strings. The tackles, ends,
and fullback always take the worst
beating against S.C. Thornhill and
Lawson took great pains in direct- j
ing ihese men how to play their po- j'
sitiens. It is up to the line men on j
the wider plays to knock down the j
interference and then let the full- |
back take the man with the ball, j
Line Experienced
The center of Stanford's line is j
experienced and no team this sea
son has* found it possible to gain
consistently through it, but the j
other four linemen with the excep- i
ti' M of A1 Norgard /are all sopho
mores. So far this season they have
not shown any signs of stage fright,
bul the strain of such an important
game may tell on them.
All the cripples were out and with
the exception of Maentz seemed to j
be in good shape. Maentz did not j
put on the speed at any time during
the afternoon. If he is not able to
stay in the game Sim can very ably
take his place without weakening
the offense, having already made
himself at home in his old position.

first three strings. The tackles, ends,
and fullback always take the worst
beating against S.C. Thornhill and
Lawson took great pains in direct- j
ing ihese men how to play their po- j'
sitiens. It is up to the line men on j
the wider plays to knock down the j
interference and then let the full- |
back take the man with the ball, j
Line Experienced
The center of Stanford's line is j
experienced and no team this sea
son has* found it possible to gain
consistently through it, but the j
other four linemen with the excep- i
ti' M of A1 Norgard /are all sopho
mores. So far this season they have
not shown any signs of stage fright,
bul the strain of such an important
game may tell on them.
All the cripples were out and with
the exception of Maentz seemed to j
be in good shape. Maentz did not j
put on the speed at any time during
the afternoon. If he is not able to
stay in the game Sim can very ably
take his place without weakening
the offense, having already made
himself at home in his old position.
Hopes for a victory over the Thun- j
dering Herd from Troy, which have |
been dwindling all week, were re- '
vived this afternoon by Bobby Gray
son's return to practicei
Grayson ran through signal drill,
not seemingly bothered by his bad j
leg. Jack Hillman continued to run !
at first string which probably means i
:hat he will start down south. De- !
j fensivcly the team will be just as j
(strong with Hillman in, but he lacks |
(he speed of Grayson on the offense.
Thornhill and No vers are counting
! heavily on Grayson's speed to break
! him into the open around the end
more than through the line. When
Grayson once gets into the clear his
! high knee action makes him the
1 hardest man on the squad to bring

down.
Hamilton Returns
Bones Hamilton's return to the j
line-up last Saturday gave Grayson |
his opportunity to break loose. Ham- j
ilton does not stop at taking one j
man out of (he play but keeps his |
feet and is always in a position to j
protect the ball-carriers.
The goofs turned traitors last night j.
and ran Trojan plays against the
