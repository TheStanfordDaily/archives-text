# Frosh Haze "Doddering" Maryland U. Sophomores
## 
### 
Freshmen are hazing sophomores
a. the University of Maryland. Tra
dition is reversed al the Eastern col- I
lege because "weak and doddering"
sophomores failed to enforce fresh
men rules.
Sophomores retaliated by calling
the frosh "spiritless amoebae," ex
pressed willingness to return to old j
methods.
