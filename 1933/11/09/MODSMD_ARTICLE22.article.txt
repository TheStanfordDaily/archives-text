"People are saying that the flight i 1
of the Blue Eagle has come to a <
full stop. That is a lie. The NRA 11
program Is succeeding," declared j<
George R. Creel, NRA organizer of ;
the Pacific Coast, at a dinner given j
by the Palo Alio Democratic Club !
last night. "The greatest proof of ;
its success is the new spirit of the 1
pet.pie, and the attack upon it, which [
is the action of certain great news- j
papers and interests who want back j
their rubber dice and their black- I
jacks."
Creel spoke quickly, sharply. "The j
attacks do not worry me. The pop
ular impatience of today does worry
me; people want a millenium over
night. The NRA is more than an j
expedient. Its ultimate purpose is
to have a new deal in which life
shall be more generous and less ter
rifying."
His alert brown eyes and empha
tic tones made his short talk effec- I
tive. Organizer Creel said he worked '
lby no NRA Code. He has acted as
• arbitrator in 30 strikes in two weeks.
I Besides his NRA duties, Creel is
regional chairman of Ihe National j
Labor Board, and in his spare time j
oversees labor conditions in Califor- i
Inia, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, Hawaii,]
' and Alaska.
