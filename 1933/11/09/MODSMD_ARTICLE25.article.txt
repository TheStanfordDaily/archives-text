# Repeal Not Solution of Problem, Says LaPiere
## 
### 
The joyously hailed repeal of the
j 18th amendment i.s not a solution of
I Ihc liquor problem any more than
j piohibition was, Dr. Richard La
| Piere told some 200 students in his
! elementary sociology class yesterday
j morning.
1 "Alcohol is not a moral nor a
psychological problem, bul a social
one, and until we get at the social
cause of it, there can be no real
solution."
Dr. LaPiere's outline of the three
| uso.s of alcohol is: custom, as French -
1 men would drink wine; compensa
tion, as a delightful gap between
ideality and reality; escape, a meth
od of breaking away from impos
sible social organization. The last

tcreates Iho only serious problem.
"The fault lies in the failure of
modern social life to keep pace with j
, the rapid growth of industry. So- |
I daily, we haven't progressed fan
be yond the Middle Ages, while tre- j
tuendous strides have been made in j
our technique of nature control."
Nothing will stop the use of aleo- !
hoi as an escape measure, but a j
new social system which will fit in- ,
|dustrialism, the sociologist believes. [
"Repeal puts us right back where |
we have'started from without ac
tually solving the problem at all."
Dr. LaPiere predicts that there
will be a revival of dry propaganda
that will start public opinion back
in the cycle of sentiment against
| liquor.
