Jof the year Noel Coward's mad
! comedy, "Hay Fever."
The honorary drama organization
lias chosen a skilled cast to read the
brilliant lines of this comedy of a
theatrical family, one which will IV s
i headed by Katrina Wallingford, who
I is expected to bring much comedy
i to her role of Judith Bliss, the re
tired actress. Miss Wallingford ap
peared in the gala Menlo Circus
i Club show last spring, and is cur-
J rently rehearsing "Paris Bound" for
I the Community Players.

Jones as IVlyra Arundel
Jean Albertson, who recently
scored such a decisive hit in "Arms
;tnd the Man," v/ill read Sorel Bliss,
the daughter of the family, a role
of great comic possibilities. Miss
Albertson read in "An Ideal Hus
band" and "Major Barbara" last
spring quarter.
James Benet, remembered for the
male lead in "Holiday," will be seen
as Simon Bliss, and will also act in
the capacity of director. In the role
of Myra Arundel will be seen Ma
rian Jones, last seen in "The Critic,"
and before that, "Holiday," as well
as several readings.
Dwan to Head Directions
Waldo Salt and William Mahu,
both reading-veterans, will have
parts. The former is also remem
bered for his work in "Anns and
the Man" and "Hawk Island." Mahu
read the title role in "An Ideal Hus
band" last spring.
Three newcomers to the organiza
tion's readings are Shelley Smith,
Harriet Hall, and Sherman McFed
riesâ€”all of whom have had consid
erable experience elsewhere in dra
matics. Robert Dwan will read the
stage directions.
