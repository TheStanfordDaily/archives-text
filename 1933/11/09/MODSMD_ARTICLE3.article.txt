# Cuban Chaos
## 
### 
Happy chaotic Cuba was on the |
loose again. War, bloodshed, revo- i
lution was rife. Martial law was,
cleclarcd, newspapers were muz
zled, garrisons were besieged in Ha- '
vana. Reason: the A.B.C. potent
revolutionary body, which lost con- !
1 rol and the presidency to Student ;
Directory after knocking out Ma-j
chado, was out to get its man, de ,
Cespedes, already an ex-president,:
in.
The student directory and army j
non-com. government of President !
(incumbent) Grau didn't like the'
idea, was trying to shoot it down.
Result: Havana was a howling mess.
Li.S. destroyers scurried out of the
bay, striving to get out of range.
Americvji Ambassador Welles an- \
nounced U.S. troops would not be!
landed to protect Americansâ€”at 1
least, yet. Meanwhile, a rumor went
the rounds A.B.C. was prepared to
destroy American property to force
intervention. Reason: belief that in
tervention would .show non-recog
nized Grau Government out of
pewer.
