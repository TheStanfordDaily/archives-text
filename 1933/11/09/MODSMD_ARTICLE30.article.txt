# Tammany Is Licked

### 
And I lie Tiger was (timed. And Mayor O'Brien lias been
given a well - earned retirement. Serious - minded, well
meaning, good-government folk will rejoice everywhere.
The demon, Tammany, lias been laid low.
La (iuardia, fresh from Socialist, Progressive, and Re
publican circles, lias been elected on a Fusion ticket. Now
the Xew York populace, having done its duty, will admit
to itself that it has done its duty, and go back to its movies,
evening papers, and subway jams.
But good government must be more than this. It is not
enough that Tammany has been beaten. It is not enough
that the "Little Flower" has become the big shot. Govern
ment is continuous. Tammany is continuous. Public in
terest is transitory.
If New York City is to get a clean government, the
people must be alive, or at least fairly alive, always. They
cannot relax a moment.
If Tammany is to be kept out of power, longer than four
years, the bulwarks of Tammany must be blasted forever.
I he tenements must be cleared, for there lies the heart of
Tammany. Public utilities and public contracting must be
.made as clean as La Guardia's political record, for in those
lields lies the soul of Tammany. That will be difficult.
But good government will tread on people's toes. We
(that is we, the good people) do not want a completely
honest government. Everyone has a hankering to know
"Eddie" who knows the fellow who can fix a tag. Every
one wants to be a favorite. As Professor Barclay puts it.
the American people favor "equality for none and special
privileges for all."
That's the chief rub. That's why Tammany will come
back and probably after four years of good, clean La
Ciuardia government.
