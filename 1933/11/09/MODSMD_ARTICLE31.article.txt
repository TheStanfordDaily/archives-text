# About Another Questionnaire
## 
### 
All college students are not gin-sodden, jazz-crazed in
competents, as a section of the American public believes.
Evidence that a good percentage of present-day students
are capable of constructive thought comes from the results
of a questionnaire distributed by the National Student
Federation.
A total of 22,815 collegiates replied, from all parts of
the country. Of this number, 0,317 students said they
would support the United States in any war; 7,.112 would
bear arms only if this country were invaded; 8,{)38—-the
largest number declared that they would never fight in
any war.
It was found that the proportion of absolute pacifists
in State universities where military training is compulsory
was larger than elsewhere. That is natural. The poll was
foolishly prohibited at the University of Nebraska.
It is probably true that if war came, many of the paci
fists would change their minds. The roll of the drums, the
blare of the bands, the wave of the flags, the blah from
newspaper and pulpit would take their toll.
War is exciting. That is unfortunate, for people like
exciting things. As long as it is exciting, it will probably
exist. Sitting comfortably full of a thick steak, it is hard
to see why anyone would go to war. That accounts for the
questionnaire. Hut a questionnaire after the papers said
that Japan had landed in Luzon or Mexico had violated
Arizona and Arizonians, and off we go singing Yankee
Doodle. It is interesting that students now think what they
do; what thev will do is more interesting.
