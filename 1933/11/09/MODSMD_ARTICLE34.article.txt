There is always a person around every organiaztion
who attempts to put everything on a mathematical basis,
usually a financial basis. Xow money is necessary and all
that, but there is a limit.
The intangible benefits are harder to see, slill harder to
pul down in six words. That is why they are passed up tor
the "brutal facts." 'This Machine Age of ours places so
much emphasis on precision, makes ns forget that while
I 1000 th of an inch is a vital thing in a differential bearing
(it there is such a tiling), it is not the correct measure of
all truths.
So with Student Government. It cannot be justified on
pure finances. It is an education and an experience for the
students. If it does that, it has succeeded though it does
cosl the students cents more per student per quarter
than if two accountants were placed at the helfti. That
should not b<> forgotten, especially should it be remem
bered when people present financial surveys, etc., etc.
Nothing lies more than a figure, except a maze of
figures.
