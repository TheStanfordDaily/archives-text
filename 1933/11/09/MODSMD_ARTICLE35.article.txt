## REPEAL: WHAT OF IT? 
### 
In the repeal of prohibition and j
in Milford, Pennsylvania's legalizing
ol Sunday football, whooping wets i
see the rise of a roaring tide of |
American liberalism. The empty
liter bottle and the empty dance
hall were shouted for by choleric I
conservatives, so the obvious con- j
elusion is that the squelching of j
this Puritanical protest heralds a
New Deal in national intellect. Won- j
derful in vision; flatly disappointing
in fact.
While repeal rolled in for a num
ber of reasons: to end gangsterism,
give men jobs, support our Presi- i
dcrit —a thorough disgust with Coco
Cola and other soda fountain high- j
balls brought out the repealing mil- !
lions. John-on-the-Street (who for
several years has been both a figu
rative and literal reality) voted wet
because he wanted beer and better.
He voted because he was thirsty, not :
because he was liberal. During the '
Mellon days, high prices for boot
leg whiskey were disgusting but i
tclerable. But when the ratio of
water to whiskey sailed higher, and
the ratio of dollars to doughnuts
sank lower, prohibition became too I
expensive.
'
Similarly, when Governor Pin- j
chot's townsfolk decided to repeal
the football and baseball Blue Laws,
it was not because they had sud
denly seen the light, not because j
ihey suddenly realized the stupidity j

lof so hedging in that Vanishing
American—personal liberty. This
year, finances were undoubtedly
low; Sunday crowds would balance
j Monday's budget. Next year, or
even tomorrow, this same enlight
j ened electorate will shout: "Down
I with the Reds." and imprison some
I starved and scrawny Communist
! orator.
| It is simple desire, and not lofty
vision that brings us the 21sl amend
j ment. Because desire and vision
i happen to be on the same side of
I the current fence, is nothing very
; commendable. A John P. O'Brien,
I in any party, is just as prognathous.
In a test of liberalism, thoughts
| speak louder than affiliations.
Yet if the action can be father to
the thought, perhaps the repeal
liberalism association will bear some
1 fruit. That the element of environ
; mental conditioning is more irnpor
-1 tant than innate intellect in the
, matter of liberal opinion, is evi
denced by the fact that there are
men of undoubted intelligence in
the ranks of both progx - essives and
reactionaries. The broad brows of
Roosevelt and Hoover give no clues
to the cerebral fandangoes that set
one up as the leader of revolution
, ary recovery, and the other as the
I apostle of plain "Hooverism."
Liberal laws arc here, yes; but we
i have not legislated liberalism!
