## "ON TO TROY?" 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
May I take this opportunity of
complaining against the unprece
dented "nerve" of the Rally Com
mittee, or whatever body was re
sponsible, for pasting "On to Troy"
stickers on the automobiles parked
in front of Branner and other dor
mitories?
Enthusiasm has its place, ai I if
Ihe stickers merely had been placed
on the seats of the cars, for example,
to be used at the discretion or desire
of the owners of the automobiles, no
harm would have been done.
However, an automobile is private
property, and pasting stickers on
that private property without per
mission of the owners is certainly
an undue liberty, inasmuch as it
causes nuisance and annoyance to
those automobile owners who do not
care to display the aforementioned
stickers.
Yours truly,
Harry Lowenstein, '36
