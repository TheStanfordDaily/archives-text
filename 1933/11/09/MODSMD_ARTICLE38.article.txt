# Litvinoff in D.C.
## 
### 
Litvinoff was whisked through
Washington, had lunch, tea, and
dinner with argiculturists, unofficial
Russians, talked twice with Hull and
once with F.R., who will handle all
tricky questions. The Soviet am
bassador referred the press to Hull,
was affable, said nothing.
Speed is on a good sign, despite
the fact that debt claims against the
Soviet, subersive propoganda, trade
relations are already under fire.
Great care is being taken of the
envoy, while one Russian refugee,
Bautz, declares from Ellis Island,
where held, that he will "Kill him,
and drink his blood."
