THE CRITICAL CLICHE:
ll—Synopsis
When a critic details, with an atom
of critical disquisition, the plot of
each film or play which he attends,
he admits one of three things: sheer
indolence, fear of a domineering
press agent, or mediocrity. And yet,
in the daily prints from coast to
coast, this sad synopsizing habit is
everywhere apparent.
Disregarding such obvious dis
comforts as the effect of such pro
cedure upon the expectations of the
audience, the relating of plot for
plot's sake reveals deeper faults,
faults within the critic.
In the first place, while a desperate
indolence is likely to be the natural
result of a consistent attendance at
rny season's output, the majority of
bad stuff can be better commented
upon in a curt paragraph of dismis
sal.
In the second, while the threat of
a press-agentry which deems criti
cism valuable only when it is in un
qualified praise of a production, is
very real and firmly established,
some attempt must be made to avoid
it if a critic is to maintain any right
to his title. The only answer to
such tyrannical dominance is a flat
refusal to surrender. And if such
a stand arouses more threats from
a sadly important business office, the
critic can, ai least, retreat gracefully
under the cover of innuendo, the
damning praise of a cleverly worded
phrase. ' 1
Finally, there is the synopsis
which results from the critic's lack
of ability to perceive anything more
than the physical fact of production
and plot. In this case a few adjec
tives—meaningless by reason of their
careless use—cannot conceal incom
petence. Solution of this simple
problem should be a simple removal
of the offender to proof reading—
where the dullards of most news
papers seem inevitably to gather.
