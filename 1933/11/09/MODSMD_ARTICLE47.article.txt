Il looks like a great year for youth
in football coaching, with the nio.st
conspicuous newcomer being How
ard Harpster of Carnegie Tech, a
26-year-old who achieved some sort
ol fame by beating Notre Dame
7 1 0, in the first of the Ramblers
series of disasters.
With one of the lightest elevens
in recent years. Army has grabbed
oil top plate among the Eastern
(cams, with Lieutenant Gar Da
vidson in charge. The Army is
undefeated and lias beaten Yale
21-0 and Illinois (5-0. with Cadet
Johnny Buckler romping all over
the place.
Then there is Fordham who had
rolled up 1(33 points and had 6 scored
against them until the St. Mary's
Gaels effectively put a stop to their
advance. Jimmy Crowley, the famed
.smart cracking halfback of the Four
Horsemen, is doing the Fordham tu
toring.
Lon Stiner is making a record at
Oregon State where he popped up
with a potential All-Coast back in
Red Franklin and at the same time
clamped the irons on U.S.C.'s win
ning streak.

Just as a matter of diversion, we
have made up a tentative list for an
Ali-California team. It merely in
cludes players that we have seen in
action and would probably be much
revised at the end of the season.
But just at present if we had to go |
out and assemble a team on the l
basis of past showings the following
would be chosen:
Ends: Moscrip of Stanford and
Captain Palmer of Southern Cal
ifornia.
Tackles: Lutz and Boone of Cal
ifornia.
Guards: Rosenberg and Stevens
of Southern California.
Center: Christie of California.
Quarterback: Warburton, South
ern California.
Fullback: Griffith, Southern
California.
Halves: Grayson of Stanford,
and Sobrero of Santa Clara.
Now that will undoubtedly bear
revision before the last dog goes
home, but right now we believe it,
could be very effective. The choice
of halfbacks could probably be most i
criticized, as Sobrero is generally •
acknowledged to be pretty slow, and |
Grayson is originally a fullback.
Sobrero's passing threat entitles |
him to a berth, ana with Warburton l
and Grayson for speed and Griffith
for power, you have ample ball car
rying ability. Ford Palmer has been
labeled, "not so great," but the day
he had at Berkeley in that 6-3 clas
sic puts him on our team.
And what goes for Palmer goes
for Lutz and Boone.
Some men we expect may break
into that team before long arc Frank
Alustiza, or Bob Hamilton, or Bill
Sim, or Bob Maentz. One big day
would win a place for any of them.
