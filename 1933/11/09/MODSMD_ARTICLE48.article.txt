Hearn Stars in Line
In the last 22-mlnute period the
Indian eleven kept the ball in ene
my territory for the first time dur
ing the game. Some well-played
running formations took the ball
scoring distance only to be broken
up by Cal's defense. But on one
occasion, lobbing the ball into the
goalzone behind the Bears' uncau- ,
tious goalie, the Redmen came with
in an inch of their second score.

Hearn starred in the scrappy for
ward line, according to Coach Harry 1
Maloney, often outfooting the tena
cious Bear defense. While goalie
Jack King executed some difficult
saves, Cy Johnson, left fullback,
played a beautiful game, with nu
merous lengthy and tricky boots
which set Cal back on its heels.
In midfield Rudy Gonzales, right
half, and Waddy White, left half,
played excellent soccer against the
much - touted California forward
phalanx.

only to be repelled.

win for Stanford.
After a defensive game in the first
half and just two minutes after an
unlucky Blue and Gold shot was
saved only by the Stanford goalpost,
the Redmtn opened up to outplay
California soceerites. Acting as a
signal for this inspired combat form,
Hearn's tally ended the third quar
tet and sent the Cardinal soccer
men into the last quarter in their !
best offensive display.
Hearn Stars in Line
In the last 22-mlnute period the
Indian eleven kept the ball in ene
my territory for the first time dur
ing the game. Some well-played
running formations took the ball
scoring distance only to be broken
up by Cal's defense. But on one
occasion, lobbing the ball into the
goalzone behind the Bears' uncau- ,
tious goalie, the Redmen came with
in an inch of their second score.
*
Hearn starred in the scrappy for
ward line, according to Coach Harry 1
Maloney, often outfooting the tena
cious Bear defense. While goalie
Jack King executed some difficult
saves, Cy Johnson, left fullback,
played a beautiful game, with nu
merous lengthy and tricky boots
which set Cal back on its heels.
In midfield Rudy Gonzales, right
half, and Waddy White, left half,
played excellent soccer against the
much - touted California forward
phalanx.
Cal Reserves Break In
With the enemy goalkeeper on the
ground and futilely body-blocking (
the ball l'ronr there, fast Cal reserves,
broke in too soon for the charging ;
Indian forwards. Other shots, some
by Captain Carl Knecht from left
wing, swung toward the goalmouth ;
only to be repelled.
As the final quarter drew to an
end, daylight did also and the con
flict was obscured to the 200 fired-up
spectators. On the darkened field |
nlay became difficult atjd chances of
error and fluke scores became
greater. These factors made the
game more hotly contested and the
fiery scrimmage ended in the fastest,
hardest playing of the season.
