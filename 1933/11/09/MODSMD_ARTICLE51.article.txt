# POWERFUL BEAR YEARLINGS AIM AT UPSETTING INDIANS SATURDAY

Floating across the Bay from II
Berkeley as the time for the Little (
Big Game nears, come rumors of a <
powerful and much-improved Cali- ]
tornia yearling team, confident, and
primed to upset the Stanford frosh
in next Saturday's annual battle. I
Starting off their season in rela- i
tively poor fashion, the Berkeley j
Club dropped one of their curly
games to San Mateo J.C. by a do- <
eisive 13 to 0 score, ending an un- <
defeated two-year stretch that had
lasted ever since Clint Evans took
! over the freshman football reins at
California.
Edge to Stanford
The same powerful San Mateo
eleven bowed to Stanford by a 7-6 ;
score, indicating a comparative ad- .
vantage in favor-of the Indians .over
the Bears. Against San Mateo, how- ,
ever, Coach Bradshaw's men reached
a high-water mark in their season's
play that was equaled only in the
S.C. game.
At the same time, their California
rivals have been steadily improving,
strengthening their defense, and
polishing up their scoring attack.
Lf-st Saturday the Cubs upset the ,
powerful Sacramento J.C. team 14
to 0. Both Stanford and California
lost to the S.C. Trcbabes although
the Indians came much closer to
winning than did their trans-Bay
rivals.
The value of all this foregoing
theorizing about comparative scores,
however, amounts to exactly noth
ing in the final analysis. Two years
1 ago the Stanford frosh went into the
Little Big Game theoretically about
50 points weaker than California.
The final score was actually but 7
to 0 in favor of the Bears, with the
Indian Babes coming within an ace
of winning. Conversely, the Bears
held last year's great Stanford trosh
j team to a 7-7 tie.
Babes can Win
The winner of the Little Big Game
more often is the team that tries
hardest for victory, despite poten
tial advantages or disadvantages.

Certainly not inferior potentially,
Coach Bradshaw's men are quite
sapable of winning the traditional
fracas.
Granted that they can win, Brad
shaw believes his charges will if
they play the brand of football that
they "irave shown in earlier season '
games. Whatever the result, it's al
ways a safe bet that the Little Big
Game will be one of the most inter
esting and hard-fought of the entire
schedule, varsity or freshman.
