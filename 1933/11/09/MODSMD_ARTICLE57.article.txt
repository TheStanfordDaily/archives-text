Darkness settling over the polo j
field late yesterday afternoon found |
95 hard-working bandsmen perfect- ;
ing formations, in preparation for
Ihe competition against Lieut. Har
old William Roberts' Trojan Band
at the Olympic Stadium Saturday.
At length they turned toward
home to polish instruments, clean
shoes, and press uniforms; and then
to return to the band house today
for a last review of musical num
bers; followed by an appearance at
the S.C. rally tonight at the Pavilion;
and finally to board the Sunset Lim
ited for Los Angeles tomorrow night
at 7:20 o'clock.
This is the program worked out â– 
for the band after last night's action j
that finally paved the way for the !
musicians' southern jaunt, when $800 j
was appropriated by the Ex Com- ;
mittee to add to the $300 plus food
expenses donated by band members j
themselves.
