ing and reports from the delegates

Booth Discusses Tariffs

a point of view which holds that the
j duty of the State is to increase the
j power of the State, regardless of the
individual. Booth decried the erec
tion of tariff barriers as leading to
; isolation. "The borrowing state can
always reciprocate," said Booth.
