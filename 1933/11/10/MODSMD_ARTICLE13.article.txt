# Clubs Debate World Topics
## Hitlerism and Russia Are Discussed at Meet 
### 
In the Women's Clubhouse, Inter
national Relations Club conferred,
round - tabled, debated yesterday
afternoon. Topics for the table-talk:
Hitlerism and Russia in the Pacific
Area proved diffuse, controversial.
The Hitler table, most popular,
rocked back and forth as Bromley
Smith and a San Francisco Stater
waxed wrath and wordy on the rel
ative merits of Mazzini's nationalism
and Carnegie's internationalism as
forces for World Peace. Up popped
Hitler nationalism again, this time
versus communism. Which, was the
question, was the most provocative
of war.
Ruth McFarland, table leader, had
barely put this under the table when
National Socialist Germans (Slate
College men) attacked the Interna
tional Jew (Hitler's pet), grew bit
ter charging Russia was in essence
a Jew-demoniated Capitalism.
Discussion Calmed
A bit dazed at this medievalism,
back came Smith and others of the
internationally-minded. Discussion
ended here with calm-voiced Kirby
Scheicher, assistant in Political Sci
ence, asking for a gentler, more sci
entific tone to the discussion, em
phasizing that, after all, the problem
was world peace, that these methods
were scarcely peaceful.
Quieter, but less informed, Russia
and the Pacific table stayed calm if
verbose. Recognition of Russia by
the United States, it was the con
census of student opinion, would be
a factor in peace in the troubled
Pacific.
League a Benefit
Next step, it was suggested
(I hough scarcely hoped), that the
United States and Russia enter into
the League. This would force Out
law Japan into returning. Meantime,
Russian-United States resumption of
diplomatic relations would enable
the four power and nine power
pacts to be expanded,-permit a Pa
cific Powers Conference to be
shortly held.
Followed a luncheon, brief re
sumes of the table-topics, a talk by
traveling Carnegian Jones, and the
conference was adjourned by
Ciompton Bangs Jr., Stanford I.R.C.
president. All was quiet on the in
ternational front.
