# GOOD CROWD APPRECIATES COMIC PLAY
## Skilled Cast Adds Zest To Group's Reading Of "Hay Fever" 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
As an auspicious opening to its
season of play readings, Sword and
Sandals last night presented a gala
reading of Noel Coward's gala com
edy, "Hay Fever," It v/as done by
a skilled group of readers who
caught admirably both the madness
and the satire of this direct ances
tor of "Private Lives."
It is a play which combines bril
liantly insane dialogue with ridicu
lously situations, and both these
delightful factors were immensely
heightened by the very talented
readers..
The incredible character of Ju
dith Bliss, retired and extremely
temperamental actress, was given
broadly delightful interpretation
by Katrina Wallingford. Miss Wal
lingford dominated all her scenes
and succeeded in a genuine char
acterization.
Miss Wallingford's work last night
was in the nature of a triumph—
and a well-deserved one it was, at
that—for she made the most of every
speech, subtlety, and shading of the
amazing Judith Bliss.
Pointed reading of humorous lines
was the outstanding element in the
Sorel Bliss of Jean Albertson, who
likewise contributed some fine se
rious moments.
James Benet deserves a double
bouquet, for his direction of the
players—no mean feat, as well as
for his very deft reading of the
caty-arty Simon Bliss, from which
he drew much humor.
As the domineering David Bliss,
father of the insane family, Sherman
McFedries made an impressive de
but, while Marian Jones brought
forth her infallible gift for comedy
to excellent effect.
The sauve Richard Greatham, the
naive Jackie Cory ten, and the in
evitable Sandy Tyrell—all guests at
the party—were ably enacted by
Waldo Salt, Shelley Smith, and Wil
liam Mahu. Harriett Hall was an
adequate Clara, and Robert Dwan
handled the difficult stage directions
in a highly effective manner.
