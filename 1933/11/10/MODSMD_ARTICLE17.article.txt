Stanford's most famous alumnus
Herbert Hoover caught half the fish
of the entire fishing party which ho
attended in Mexican waters this
week. He landed at Long Beach
with a catch of three Marlin sword
fish and one sailfish Thursday. For
mer Secretary of Agriculture Arthur
Hyde brought home the biggest fish.
The party, cruising on the yacht of
Willis J. Hole of Pasadena, was gone

a fine time fishing. I had good luck,
better than ever before." Hoover
refused to make a statement con
cerning prohibition and public af
