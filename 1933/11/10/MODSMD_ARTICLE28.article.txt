# S. C. Writer Fears Cards
## Troy Editor Says Indians May Take Contest

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 9.—Al
though Southern California has the
pie-game edge over Stanford in Los
Angeles railbird circles, the Trojans
do not deserve the favor.
In spite of the fact that the In
dians have been defeated once, the
Trojans have done nothing this year
to merit their being given the ad
vantage.
S.C. has not been thrown off the
Conference horse yet, but it has not
met up to expectations. True, it van
quished Washington State and Loy
ola by substantial margins. In the
St. Mary's, Oregon State, and Cali
fornia encounters, however, the team
tied up and did not make a bold
front with the offense that had been
so widely heralded during the
early season publicity campaign.
Trojans "Tie-up"
Now any team that will tie-up like
that is not to be trusted in crucial
games. It may come through, but
it is just as likely to be so cramped
that it will be stopped in its tracks;
and Stanford is the team that can
stop it.
Stanford's attack has been bally
booed skyhigh, bqt the attack has
not yet functioned smoothly. So,
there is the dangerous probability
that the Indian machinery will be
running too well on the Coliseum
greensward — too well for Howard
Jones and his Trojans.
That all sounds like a lot of anti-
Trojan propaganda. When a team
like Troy's comes so close to defeat,
and still refuses to take heed, then
that team is riding for a fall. The
players' confidence has not abated
one whit, and the trusting fans con
tinue to heap wreaths of laurels on
Troy, while worshipping at the Tro
jan shrine. And idolatry cannot last,
Individually, all the men will be
ready for the battle, physically in
tact. Bob Erskine, the meaty tackle,
will be back in his lingerie drawers
and silk pants, completely recovered
from a pulled tendon injury.
Substitutes Out
Francis McGinely, Rosy Rosen
berg's immediate understudy, is still
shelved with a broken ankle. Inky
Wotkyns, half-pint fullback, will be
a spectator with his cracked ribs.
Capt. Fred Palmer and Julie Bes
. cos, ends; Rosenberg and Larry Ste
vens, guards; and Curt Youel, cen
| ter, will hold down their posts.
From the roster which includes
Brick Bright, Hueston Harper, Geo.
Lady, Jed Ostling, Herb Tatsch, Al
| vie Coughlin, and Erskine, Jones
| will pick his two tackles.
Galloping Home Griffith is being
curried for 60 minutes of action at
1 fullback. Cotton Warburton and
i Bill Howard will exchange quar
terback duties; Howard will prob
ably start because of his weight ad
vantage.
The kingpins of the Trojan at
tack, the blocking halves, will be
Bob McNeish and Cal Clemens.
Their substitutes will be Gordon
| Clark and Cliff Propst, respectively.
Jones himself felt confident of a
decisive win over California and as
; much as told his players that before
\ the game. He has Revised his phi
losophy since October 28' and a
; deeper scowl wrinkles his leather
face now.

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 9.—Al
though Southern California has the
pie-game edge over Stanford in Los
Angeles railbird circles, the Trojans
do not deserve the favor.
In spite of the fact that the In
dians have been defeated once, the
Trojans have done nothing this year
to merit their being given the ad
vantage.
S.C. has not been thrown off the
Conference horse yet, but it has not
met up to expectations. True, it van
quished Washington State and Loy
ola by substantial margins. In the
St. Mary's, Oregon State, and Cali
fornia encounters, however, the team
tied up and did not make a bold
front with the offense that had been
so widely heralded during the
early season publicity campaign.
Trojans "Tie-up"
Now any team that will tie-up like
that is not to be trusted in crucial
games. It may come through, but
it is just as likely to be so cramped
that it will be stopped in its tracks;
and Stanford is the team that can
stop it.
Stanford's attack has been bally
booed skyhigh, bqt the attack has
not yet functioned smoothly. So,
there is the dangerous probability
that the Indian machinery will be
running too well on the Coliseum
greensward — too well for Howard
Jones and his Trojans.
That all sounds like a lot of anti-
Trojan propaganda. When a team
like Troy's comes so close to defeat,
and still refuses to take heed, then
that team is riding for a fall. The
players' confidence has not abated
one whit, and the trusting fans con
tinue to heap wreaths of laurels on
Troy, while worshipping at the Tro
jan shrine. And idolatry cannot last,
Individually, all the men will be
ready for the battle, physically in
tact. Bob Erskine, the meaty tackle,
will be back in his lingerie drawers
and silk pants, completely recovered
from a pulled tendon injury.
Substitutes Out
Francis McGinely, Rosy Rosen
berg's immediate understudy, is still
shelved with a broken ankle. Inky
Wotkyns, half-pint fullback, will be
a spectator with his cracked ribs.
Capt. Fred Palmer and Julie Bes

From the roster which includes
Brick Bright, Hueston Harper, Geo.
Lady, Jed Ostling, Herb Tatsch, Al

Galloping Home Griffith is being
curried for 60 minutes of action at
1 fullback. Cotton Warburton and
