j When Trojans were still restricted
j to the other side ot : the Aegean Sea l
land Howard .Jones was an under
graduate at Yale, Stanford played
j il i. first game with U.S.C. II was back
in 1905 that all of 17 players, neither
thundering nor a herd, journeyed to
the Farm and took a 16 to 0 beating
| from the Cardinals.
Considering the U.S.C. contest a
! mere preliminary gÂ«me, the Daily
Palo Alto cites the record of the
.southern team .so far that season.
It seems'they had beaten Harvard
| Prep School, the Los Angeles Poly-
I technic High School, and Whittier
j Slate College; I he latter by a mar

gin of 14 touchdowns.
The Daily reported the playing of
U.S.C. in the game as:
''The southerners had the ball in
their possession but a few times, but
lost it on fumbles as often as on
downs."
The game was played at the newly
completed Stanford Held whose
bleachers held 15,000, and that w;i.
hailed as "one of the finest football
fields in the country."
Other features of the new $8,000
field were a six by eight score
board set on top of the board fence,
iind a bright green training house
ft.r the players.
