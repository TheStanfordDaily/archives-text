# Large Varsity Squad Ready For Great Fight In Game Tomorrow
## INJURED RECOVERING Palamountain Only Player Not in Shape 
### Spud Hamilton 
Stomping out on the Coliseum
field at Los Angeles tomorrow
will he .'{!) Stanford varsity grid
men, bent on nothing else but the
hoisting of the Ole' Trojan Horse
into the Ole' lied Machine and
bringing it home to the Farm for
safekeeping. Coach "Tiny" Thorn
hill of the Cardinals has an
nounced that his team is going
south to win; they will not play
a defensive game, but will he on
the peck, locking for a break and
a chance to win the game.
Clad in the while* jerseys (because
S.C. as ihe home team lias elected
to wear red) and new gabardine
pants fresh out of stock, all men
will be ready for pliiy, although
there are a good many in a slightly
bedraggled condition.
Halfbacks Shaky
Bill Sim, Johnny Reisner, Bob
Maentz all are off their top form due
to injuries; Bobby Grayson is just
out of the hospital, and it is doubt
ful if Bob Hamilton must wear his
"pumpkin head" guard or not. With
the exception of Ben Palarnountain
at left tackle, the remainder of team
is in good shape, and Palarnountain
is not counted on.
Thornhill is undecided on his
starting line-up at two positions:
left half and center. The key .spot
of left half is a tossup between Bill
Sim, Johnny Reisner, and Bob
Maentz. All have been suffering in
juries, and at present, Sim appears
to be in the best shape.
At center, 217-pound Wes Mul
ler is pushing veteran Bill Bates
hard for the opening berth, and is
a 50-sft bet to open the game.
For the rest, Thornhill is prctl.v
well derided on Jim Moscrip and
AI Norgard for ends; Bob Rey
nolds and "Cab" Callaway, tack
les: Bob O'Connor and Bill Corbus,
guards; Grayson at fullback.
Aiustiza at quarter, and Bob
Hamilton at right half.
With Sim at left half, that, combi
nation will include three backs who
starred at rugby last winter, and a
wide open fray with the ball hop
; ping around like a hot potato may
i be the result.
11 Maentz opens at left half, the
| Cardinals will have four completely
i triple threat men, all of whom have
done the kicking and passing for
I the team at one time. Speed is the
keynote, always.
