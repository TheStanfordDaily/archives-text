While all the papers blare about the national champions,
the undefeated marvels, etc., Stanford students do not lose
their perspective on values and are able to muster up a
proud and haughty "bird" for tin' Trojans. Of course if
they win, all we have is perspective. They have a hard

Yet, it is all part of the game, this by-plav between the

our defeat with them; or, perhaps, this year to help them
forget their downfall. It is a hope.
