# A 						Tribute Deserving to Remain
## 
### 
One Stanford tradition after another has disappeared
in the memory of this undergraduate generation. Right
fully struek hv L\ Committee's J)lo\vs, the frcshman-sopho
i.iore tieup and the Hon fire h&ve fallen. Student indiffer
ence, not so formally expressed, has removed the signifi
cance of the seniors' right to the bench by the Library, the
male prerogative to the Engineering Hench; even the Law
Steps have been threatened.
The tradition against smoking on Quad, founded not
on mere fluff but out of deference to the wishes of Mrs.
Stanford, is being flaunted continually. For years ii has
been a joy and delight to see roughs, disrespectful of all
else, step just off the Quad to light their cigarettes and
again step onto it after taking one last drag and flicking
ti/.c cigarette away.
Ttraditions with no real basis might as well die. Hut
this, a delightful tribute in a disrespectful world, deserves
to live.
