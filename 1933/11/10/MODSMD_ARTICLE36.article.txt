# Prediction

### 
Oblivious of what will be happening before a milling,
cheering bowl of humanity nearly five hundred miles
away, Stanford's freshman football players will be having
their moment tomorrow before an estimated 82,(MM) empty
seats. Thev play their annual Little Hig Game with Uni
versity of California's babes, and they'll be battling just as
s< riously as their older brothers will against U.S.C.
The football faithful who turn out to see the frosh will
be rewarded with an afternoon of real enjoyment provided
by two groups of youngsters who love the game, who take
il on the chin or on the shin and revel in the afterglow as
they think back over a lot of swell times.
The Daii.v hopes that they will go on to permeate the
game with that idea. It won't be long before the last hang
over of the days when kicking and even biting was com
mon will be passed. Then will the enjoyment be complete
and will sportsmen really have something to lalk about.
