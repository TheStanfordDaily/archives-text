AIDA (Verdi)
War Memorial Opera House
For all its anachronism, faculty
I framework, and tawdry grandeur,
"Aida" is an opera that persists in
i spite of itself. Verdi, even in Egyp
tian grand style, still had that solid
I Italian vigor which makes all his
tunes spirited and dramatic. And i
: his theatricalism was always as di
j feet as it was sincere.
If the singing is merely compe- ,
| tent, the opera's profuse melodies ;
J and bombastic accents will carry
themselves as accompaniment to the
pageantry. But the singing Wed
' ntsday night was more than com
petent: it was vital, beautiful, and
I exciting, with the pageantry appro
' priately secondary. Distinction
marked the smooth, well-integrated
performance.
Claudia Muzio made an attractive,
i lyric Aida. Her bel canto was full
and clear and especially lovely in
; piano passages, although she still j
; plays tricks with her lower voice, i
' Her fortissimo notes, too, have an
: inclination to be overly shrill.
Giovanni Martinelli proved that |
! his Samson was a mistake by sing
j ing a consistently accurate —if some
| what strident—Radames. His duets
; v\ ith Muzio were particularly fine,
i The two artists nicely contrasted
j tenderness and passion in the Nile
scene and the death finale which
raised the familiar music to a fresh
; integrity. The last duet succeedcd
'■ in not being anticlimactic—an un
j usual feat.
The Amnevis of Kathryn Meisle is
an old story and still one of the ;
best. Her surety and flexibility of
i tone, particularly in her solo scene, j
| compensated for all her defects as !
ian actress. Pinza's Ramifs had his
; customary magnificence of voice
| and style, while Richard Bonelli dis- j
| tinguished Amonasro more for his
| characterization than for vocal elo- !
i quence.
Ensemble singing was the high
! point of the various abilities of the
I artists; the emotionalism was more
neatly balanced. The inevitable sec
: ond act. made up in grandiloquent
; enthusiasm what it essentially lacks
i in taste, and the ballet again proved
; San Francisco's good fortune in ac
-1 quiring the services of Adolph Bolm.

The Amnevis of Kathryn Meisle is

Ensemble singing was the high

AIDA (Verdi)
War Memorial Opera House
For all its anachronism, faculty
I framework, and tawdry grandeur,
"Aida" is an opera that persists in
i spite of itself. Verdi, even in Egyp
tian grand style, still had that solid
I Italian vigor which makes all his
tunes spirited and dramatic. And i
: his theatricalism was always as di
j feet as it was sincere.
If the singing is merely compe- ,
| tent, the opera's profuse melodies ;
J and bombastic accents will carry
themselves as accompaniment to the
pageantry. But the singing Wed
' ntsday night was more than com
petent: it was vital, beautiful, and
I exciting, with the pageantry appro
' priately secondary. Distinction
marked the smooth, well-integrated
performance.
Claudia Muzio made an attractive,
i lyric Aida. Her bel canto was full
and clear and especially lovely in
; piano passages, although she still j
; plays tricks with her lower voice, i
' Her fortissimo notes, too, have an
: inclination to be overly shrill.
Giovanni Martinelli proved that |
! his Samson was a mistake by sing
j ing a consistently accurate —if some
| what strident—Radames. His duets
; v\ ith Muzio were particularly fine,
i The two artists nicely contrasted
j tenderness and passion in the Nile
scene and the death finale which
raised the familiar music to a fresh
; integrity. The last duet succeedcd
'■ in not being anticlimactic—an un
j usual feat.
