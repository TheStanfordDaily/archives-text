# WILD BOYS OF THE ROAD
## 
### 
(First National)
At the Varsity Theatre
In spite of the optimistic moral
ending and one or two unnecessary
efforts to wring too many tears, this
is emphatically a picture worth see
ing—not from any social duty or
timely topics viewpoint, but from
the appreciative viewpoint of good
cinema. It is to be contrasted to
that recent pitiful dirge, "Heroes for
i Sale," which relied for effect on its
| drabness and the oppressive weight
! of calamitous coincidence on the
hero. The incident in "Wild Boys"
: —the amputation of a boy's leg.
i fights with trainmen and cops, a
rape, a,murder, a hold-up—are not,
cinematically speaking, extraordi
nary. It sounds sensational. But the
absolute sincerity and realism with
I which the story is treated is what
lifts it above melodrama and makes
j it geuninely moving.
It is not morbid and gloomy; it
! has good comedy, which is inherent
! in the situations, i.e., not forced
! and blatant "comic relief." It is not
ja preachment; it is an intensely in
-1 teresting story of two boys and a
1 t'iri who leave home so that "there
will be one less mouth to feed."
The picture gets it reality from
its imaginative use of detail—the
way in which a caretaker knocks
out his pipe, the smaller piece of
cake which the boy takes upon the
first hint of economising—and from
its fairness, as evidenced in the
[ kindliness of the yard inspectors and
the unwillingness of the firemen to
fight the boys with hose. There is
none of the infuriating character
distortion which was found in "I
Am a Fugitive." The compelling
circumstances here assume a more
nebulous, and therefore more real-
I istic, form than paunchy self-sat
isfied officials. And circumstance
follows circumstance naturally anc

inevitably, so that the film covei - s
u period of time in smooth sequence
and not in jerky episodic fashion.
The acting of the whole cast is
utterly natural, for which Director
Wellman is perhaps responsible.
Edwin Phillips was spendid in a
quiet warm portrayal of one of the
boys; he is remarkable for the dig
nified restraint :md maturity of his
acting. Frankie Darrow, in a more
flashy part, was almost defiantly
sincere, although occasionally he lets
the mobility of his features run
away with him. Dorothy Coonan
might be Ruby Keeler at the age
of 15. The supporting cast Hs con
sistently good, almost disturbing in
the effect of reality they produce.
Walls of Gold: except for an ex
cellent deathbed scene, done by
some actress whose name I know
not, and for some good high comedy
by Ralph Morgan, the film was
neither impressive nor amusing. As
a lady behind me remarked, Sally
Eiiers is cute, Norman Foster is
cute, the gowns are cute, the house
they live in is cute. And it's a prob
lem play. Requiescat. —Brauns
