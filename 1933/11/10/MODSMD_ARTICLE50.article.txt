# "BEST CHANCE IN YEARS" MISNOMER
## 
### 
We would like to say that Stan
ford has tho best chance in years to
win, but bitter experience has
proven that the "best chance to win
ir. years" of other games has always
been a misnomer, to the extent at
least that Stanford never won.
Neverthele .-s, we cannot inhibit
thai .sneaking hunch that this will
be the time, and that the combina
tion of a new coaching staff and an
influx of new material will provide
a winning combination. One thing
is sure, school spirit won't prove
much of a boost for ths team be
cause spirit has become a mighty
dull thing around this campus, what
with the long list of Trojan con
quests. â€”Hamilton
