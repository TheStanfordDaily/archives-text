# BATTLE LOOMS IN LITTLE BIG GAME HERE TOMORROW
## 
### Charles Chappell 
Determined to upset their tra
ditional rivals and quite capable
of turning the trick, the Stanford
freshman grid warriors will meet
California tomorrow in the Stan
lord Stadium, in the annual "game
of the year" for both teams.
Equally capable, and probably
just as determined, will be the
young Bears, since the Little Big
Game is always the scason-cli
maxing effort for the two year
ling squads.
However poor its early season
jiecord, the team that wins tomor
11ow will be v/ell-satisfied with its
year's work, for it's the Little Big
I Game alone that really counts. It
I affords the one great opportunity
!in redemption.
Both Teams Beaten
While neither team has had what
might be called a disastrous season,
both have felt the familiar sling of
defeat and both know what it means
:to finish up a game with a large
: but empty goose-egg as their share
of the day's festivities.
It is this very fact that points to
ward one whale of a battle when
■ the two yearling squads clash to
' morrow. Both will be out to avenge
earlier losses and wind up a suc
: cetsful season, nor will either be
particularly considerate of the
other's hopes or intentions.
Although two valuable men, Hur-
I ley and Williams, will be unable to
I play for Stanford, the Indians are
j otherwise in pretty good . shape.
Captain Dale Beedle and Joe Vigna,
lout for some time with injuries, will
1 be ready to go, at tackle and in the
fcackfield, respectively.
Most serious for Stanford will be
the absence of Fred Williams, speedy
halfback, triple-threat artist, and
j gcal-kicker extraordinary. With few
good backfield replacements, Coach
Bradshaw has shifted Jack Walton
from guard to left half. Whatever
Walton may lack as a ball-carrier,
Bradshaw believes he will make up
as a defensive back.
Ledbetter May Star
Against Bradshaw's stalwarts, Cal-
I ifornia is expected to pit a forward
wall that can do no better than
equal Stanford's, while in the back
field the Bears have a possible ad
vantage at quarter, a definite dis
advantage at fullback. Ledbetter, if
! he continues his previous consistent
j work, will probably do most of
Stanford's ground-gaining, as well
j as a good deal of the passing.
California's backfield boasts a
number of small but speedy ball
carriers. Randall, who is considered
| its punting ace, will probably meet
; his master as long as« Stanford's
Turretto is in the game.

of turning the trick, the Stanford
freshman grid warriors will meet
California tomorrow in the Stan
lord Stadium, in the annual "game
of the year" for both teams.
Equally capable, and probably
just as determined, will be the
young Bears, since the Little Big
Game is always the scason-cli
maxing effort for the two year
ling squads.
However poor its early season
jiecord, the team that wins tomor
11ow will be v/ell-satisfied with its
year's work, for it's the Little Big
I Game alone that really counts. It
I affords the one great opportunity
!in redemption.
Both Teams Beaten
While neither team has had what
might be called a disastrous season,
both have felt the familiar sling of
defeat and both know what it means
:to finish up a game with a large
: but empty goose-egg as their share
of the day's festivities.
It is this very fact that points to
ward one whale of a battle when
■ the two yearling squads clash to
' morrow. Both will be out to avenge
earlier losses and wind up a suc
: cetsful season, nor will either be
particularly considerate of the
other's hopes or intentions.
Although two valuable men, Hur-
I ley and Williams, will be unable to
I play for Stanford, the Indians are
j otherwise in pretty good . shape.
Captain Dale Beedle and Joe Vigna,
lout for some time with injuries, will
1 be ready to go, at tackle and in the
fcackfield, respectively.
Most serious for Stanford will be
the absence of Fred Williams, speedy
halfback, triple-threat artist, and
j gcal-kicker extraordinary. With few
good backfield replacements, Coach
Bradshaw has shifted Jack Walton
from guard to left half. Whatever
Walton may lack as a ball-carrier,
Bradshaw believes he will make up
as a defensive back.
Ledbetter May Star
Against Bradshaw's stalwarts, Cal-
I ifornia is expected to pit a forward
wall that can do no better than
equal Stanford's, while in the back
field the Bears have a possible ad
vantage at quarter, a definite dis
advantage at fullback. Ledbetter, if
! he continues his previous consistent
j work, will probably do most of
Stanford's ground-gaining, as well
j as a good deal of the passing.
California's backfield boasts a
number of small but speedy ball
carriers. Randall, who is considered
| its punting ace, will probably meet
; his master as long as« Stanford's
Turretto is in the game.
Determined to upset their tra
ditional rivals and quite capable
of turning the trick, the Stanford
freshman grid warriors will meet
California tomorrow in the Stan
lord Stadium, in the annual "game
of the year" for both teams.
