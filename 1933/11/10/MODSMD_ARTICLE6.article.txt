# More Pests, More Parks
## 
### 
Tree - planting, pest - eradicating,
highway-clearing laborers are being
rounded up by Lawrence Merriarn,
California state park district officer,
to take care of park and playground
improvements. Object: another fac
tor in the Roosevelt re-employment
of 4,000,000 men now on relief rolls.
Said Merriarn: "It was indicated
that the government would pay
workers local wage scales but proj
ects must be done mainly by hand
tools. Workers may live at home,
but work camps will be in order."
