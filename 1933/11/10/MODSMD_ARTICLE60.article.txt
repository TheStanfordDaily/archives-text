# CARD TANKSTERS TROUNCE STURDY CLUB SWIMMERS
## 
### Gray Creveling 
Stanford's varsity water poloists
ran up against a rough bunch of
players Wednesday night at Oak
land when they thumped the Lake
side Swimming Club's tough aggre
gation 7-2.
Lakeside's squad used tactics not
uncommon to public plunge teams,
sweeping Stanford off its feet in the
first few minutes of play with their
battering style. Gordon Corson of
the club scored two goals before the
Cards knew what had taken place.
Triolo Scores
Coach Nort Thornton then sent
Jimmy Triolo in to substitute Bob
Foster. Triolo immediately came
through with a beautiful short throw
to score Stanford's first, and the half
ended with the Indians lagging one
point behind tough Lakesiders.
As the second half began, the club
goalie was sent from the game for
a deliberate foul, and Jimmy Benet
got loose to pitch one in, tying the
score.
Stanford fans began to rest more
easily as Triolo again rang one up,
and Wiget who had been taken from
ihc game for a foul, returned to help
Taranik slip the ball through the
goalie's hands once more.
Triolo took a long pass from
Woodard, found himself in the open,
and burned another one into the
cage. Foster came back into the
game, replacing Benet, and Mc-
Dowell jumped in for Woodard.
Taranik Passes Well
"Terrible" Taranik threw one of
his long ones into goal and Triolo
got a short one in and the game
ended in a complete rout for the
team that played with "unnecessary
roughness" throughout the contest.
Jack Clumeck, Eliot Viney, and
Charlie Danforth starred as the
junior varsily had no trouble in
trimming Lakeside's subs 10-4 in the
right's preliminary game.
