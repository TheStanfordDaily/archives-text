## WHY REVIEW? 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Mr. Sandoe, in Tuesday's paper,
has said in substance that a re
viewer should not give a synopsis
of the thing he reviews, but his in
terpretation anel imalysis of it, and
his opinion on it. Why is this so?
After all, the opinions of the re
viewer, a student like anyone else,
are scarcely likely to be of such
merit that they deserve to be ac
cepted sight unseen. His analysis
and his interpretation may be good
cnes, but that is no guarantee that
one would agree with them. Taste
is so peculiarly personal a matter
that no one, even a reviewer, is
justified in thinking, without definite

knowledge on the point, that his
taste is that of anyone else. Surely
it is better to give a synopsis. (This
does not include telling who com
mitted the murder, in mysteries!)
The leader is then in a position to
make up his own mind whether he
will probably enjoy the thing or not.
If no synopsis is given, but just a
criticism, it is quite valueless unless
one assume that his taste is the same
as the reviewer's, a most unwar
ranted assumption on the whole, or
unless one admit that he has no
taste, and must therefore use the
reviewer's.
