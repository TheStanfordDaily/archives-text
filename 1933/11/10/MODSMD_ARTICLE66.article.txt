# BEWARE OF WINTER NIGHTS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir: 1
I should like to use your "Campus
Opinion" column to warn new cam
pus motorist residents that Novem
ber usually brings freezing nights,
with attendant damage to automo
bile radiators. Automobiles which
c.ie stored outdoors are especially
vulnerable.
Damage can be avoided either by

draining the radiator before leaving
the car out for the night, or by ad
dition of an anti-freeze solution to
the radiator water. ,
This is not free anti-freeze solu
tion advertising—l submit this ad
vice so that someone may possibly
be spared the expense and bother
which a frozen radiator put me to
two winters ago.
