urday, November 17-18, at 8:15

Philip Barry, author of the drama,
makes James Hutton, Sr., the ve
hicle for expressing much of the
thesis of the play itself. Hutton's
wife divorced him several years be
fore the play begins, for what he
considers to be a very trivial causc,
and left him exceedingly bitter.
Barry's plea, as voiced by Hutton
is: 'II at first you don't succeed,
don't try again," which advice he
administers to his daughter-in-law
pursuant to the subject of marriage
and divorce.
All seats will be reserved at 50
cents each, exempt from tax, and
are on sale at the Recreational De
partment in the Community House
