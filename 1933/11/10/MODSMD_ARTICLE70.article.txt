### 
Old dogs may nut be able to learn
new tricks, but 70-year-old J. H.
Dennis apparently thinks this rule
doesn't apply to humans. At any
late this ambitious oldster is plan
ning to enroll at the University of
\l ashington, to sit in on some of the
law school discussions. He scoffs at
the idea of retiring and says, "Why,
I'm just beginning all over again."
In the same university is a 13-
year-old who claims he is the
youngest student at Washington,
David Krems. Says the Washing
lon Daily: "It will look like the mar
riage of summer and winter when
Dennis and Krems get together."

The number of fraternity pledges
at the University of Michigan this
fall is 25 per cent greater than it
has ever been.
