# "DAILY" ISSUES NEW LITERARY REVIEW DEC. 8
## Faculty, Students Urged To Submit Articles, Poetry, Stories DEADLINE SET NOV. 20 Plans Made to Encourage Campus Talent 
### 
Literary-minded students and fac- \
ulty members, regretful that, since i
the suspension of the Stanford j
"Lit," there has been no local peri- J
odical outlet for creative and critical j
writing, have not sighed in vain.
An outlet has been created!
Typewriters were oiled up and !
pens sharpened yesterday as pre
liminary rumors were heard con- |
cc-rning a "Daily" literary supple
ment which will consider examples j
of all forms of writing. The rumors
were accurate: There will be a lit
erary supplement, and publication j
date for the first issue has been j
tentatively set for December 8, with j
November 20 the deadline for manu- '
scripts.
Avoid Pitfalls
Plans for this newest campus pe
riodical have not yet been com
pleted, but its chief practical aim
will be to avoid the editorial pit
falls which have doomed previous j
campus literary magazines. The
contents of the magazine will not be
exclusively student-written, since
manuscripts coming from any source I
will be considered. Stories, poems, ;
articles, and book reviews by fac
ulty members and by competent '
' outsiders" will be printed, as well
as by the best undergraduate and !
graduate student writers.
Variety Desired
The "Daily" literary supplement
will subscribe to no hard and fast!
critical tenets, as its purpose is to
encourage a variety of forms and |
talents. In selecting material for!
publication, its concern will be pri
marily to determine how well the i
author has fulfilled his own pur
poseâ€”not'to determine whether orj
not that purpose is the best pos
sible one.
Manuscripts should be mailed to j
"Literary Supplement, Stanford
Daily," or dropped in the slot of |
Room 204 a, English Building. Manu- j
scripts should be accompanied by j
po.stage for return.
