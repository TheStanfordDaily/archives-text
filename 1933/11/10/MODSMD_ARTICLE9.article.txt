# Education Dean to Attend U.S. Civic Board Meeting
## 
### 
Dean of the Education Depart
ment, Dr. Grayson Kefauver, will
be at Los Angeles over the week
end, but not to attend the game.
His is of more vital, basic, not such
fiivolous, importance.
The California State Chamber of
Commerce, at its meeting this year,
requested his presence. Dr. Kefau
ver will divide his time between
this and the meeting of 'the advisory
committee of the LA. school survey.
