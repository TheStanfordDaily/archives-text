Congratulations
You Redskins!
Come and See This New
Pipe at
THURLOW'S
COMOY'S
GRAND SLAM
PATENT PIPE $3-50
•
• The pipe the world has been waiting for.
It is COMOY'S conviction that GRAND SLAM
will mean to you "perfect smoking."
• So please fill up. evenly of course, light up
and smoke. ... It is curious how "broken-in"
your GRAND SLAM smokes, is it not? . . .
especially for a first attempt. That is because
you have a fine bowl and the exclusive
process of briar treatment. And how
comfortable, too. That is because you have a
sensibly shaped mouthpiece.
• You will probably smoke your GRAND
SLAM right to the bottom, or perhaps you may
have to light up again (your fault you know—
bad filling most likely), but in either case you
can smoke on and on until absolutely dry ash
only remains in the bowl.
• Your smoke completed, withdraw the
mouthpiece gently and see how well your
GRAND SLAM nicotine trap, with its fluid
tight washer, has done its work. Notice the
moisture being swept out of the bowl; see the
brown film of nicotine which has not been al
lowed to reach your lips and. if your tobacco
is inclined to dryness, the small particles of dust
which you would ordinarily have drawn into
your mouth.
• It is all very true and rather clever, you
will say. COMOYS are content that this pipe
will give you the utmost possible enjoyment
from your favorite tobacco.
• Your COMOY'S GRAND SLAM will need
little attention. Run an ordinary cotton cleaner
through the mouthpiece, the nicotine trap and
the bore of the stem, and wipe the metal trap
and washer daily. Always keep the short pass
age between the bowl and the trap clear of
ash. Never blow into the mouthpiece before
having removed the moisture from the trap.
Give it a thorough rest occasionally and it will
always be your truest friend.
