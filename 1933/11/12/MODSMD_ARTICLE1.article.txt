# Depot Rally To Welcome Back Indian Varsity
## 
### 
The impregnable walls of Troy
fell with a thud Saturday.
The team that smashed those walls
and played horse with U. S. C. to
the pleasant tune of 13 to 7 arrives
home at 7:10 tomorrow morning
(Monday).
To welcome them back a rally will
be staged at the Southern Pacific
depot.
Plans for the rally have been
rushed through by former Rally
Committee Chairman Ed Boyles and
the Stanford Daily. A band will
blare out Stanford songs. Singing,
cheering students will sound the
praise of the Indians who humbled
the haughty Trojan.
Yells will be led by A1 Peache if
he arrives on the team's special.
Otherwise former Yell Leader
George McKee will be mustered
into welcome service. Coach Thorn
hill will speak.
After the short rally, the team,
Tiny Thornhill, and his coaching
staff, will be received on waiting
hay ricks. The huskiest of the
army's horses, decked out in Trojan
colors, will pull the victory caravel
up Palm drive. The wagons will
head the mobilized serpentine back
to the Campus.
Stanford Rough and Indian maid,
agog over the savory aroma of
roasted Trojan Horse meat, will be
awakened from their slumbers at 7
o'clock by the shrieking of the
Power House Whistle. Fraternity
bells will add to the general bed
lam of honking horns and scream
ing rooters. Carloads of Stanford
men and women will stream down
the Row, from the Halls, from every
where —down to the S. P. depot.
Boyles, enthused over the victory,
said last night: "Everyone on the
Campus will be present. Stanford
has been waiting for this since
1926!"
