'"The Strange Case of James Ho- (
bait" might well be the title of a
mystery story featuring President
Ray Lyman Wilbur and Alumni
Secretary Jack McDowell, who re
cently retired and was succeeded by
'Harlow Rothert, in the roles of Dr.
Watson and Sherlock Holmes, re
spectively.
For Hohart, an honorable man,
died last spring in Columbus,
Ohio, with a reputation for vera
city and a reiterated insistence 011
having graduated from Stanford.
McDowell's meticulous records,
however, revealed no Hohart
among Stanford alumni. Who was
Ilohart? The plot thickens.
On May 10, Detective McDowell
received a letter from the Salvation
Army jn Columbus. Excerpts: "You
ivay be interested to learn of the
death of Mr. James R. Hobart, who
graduated from Leland Stanford
'University in the same class as for
mer Secretary Wilbur. ... At 1 hi*
time of his death he was resident
manager of the Salvation Army
I Men's Home. . . . We gladly testify
to the sterling Christian character of
j thi.r exceptionally fine man."
I Whereupon McDowell after pe
rusing his records, answered, "Our
'University records fail to show any
record of a person by the name of
James R. Hobart, nor does President
Wilbur recall a classmate by this
name."
The Army, dissatisfied, insisted,

"It is quite possible that Mr. Ho
borfTfor reasons best known to him
self assumed the name by which we
knew him. When we went through
his personal effects we found abso
lutely nothing that would identify
himself with the past. . . . We arc
enclosing three snapshots of this
good man which may possibly aid in
identifying him."
Refusing to doubt the work of the
Salvation Army, McDowell took the
photographs and compared them to
the pictures in the 189f5 yearbook.
The mystery yrew less mysterious
as a likeness between Hobart and
Jesse Huber, Stanford '9G, was no
ticed. The mystery was solved when
"Watson" Wilbur identified Hobart
as Huber and remembered a class
mate by the latter name.
The story ends satisfactorily if
not happily. Huber's daughter
was contacted and her father's
effects sent to her. She had been
corresponding with her father by
'lis real name at Gen. Del., Colum
bus. Huber had assumed the
name of Hobart when lie became
connected with Evangeline Booth's
A rmy.
But why did a newspaper and
magazine writer who was "a great
student and desired to. study the
methods of the Salvation Army in
doing relief work" change his name
late in life?
