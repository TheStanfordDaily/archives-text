# Grayson and Corbus Win Rather Than Lose Shirts
## 
### 
Instead of having to return to the
Farm singing the expected theme
song, ''Without a Shirt," both Bob
Grayson and Bill Corbus won a
couple of these items of wearing
apparel, plus two good neckties as
a result of scoring against S.C.
As a gesture of good will, Maurice
13. Miller, Palo Aito clothier, last
week offered through Coaches Tiny
Thorhhill and Jim Lawson to re
ward the Stanford man who scored
a touchdown against U.5.C. with a
shirt and tie. So Bobby Grayson not
oniy earned the honor of being the
first Stanford man to cross the U.
S.C. goal line in three years with
his third quarter plunge into the
end zone, but also won himself the
articles of clothing.
Corbus, technically, is not eligible
for the wearing apparel award, but
''Bill kicked two field goals and won
the ball game," says Mr. Miller, and
with Bobby can claim his prize at
203 University avenue.
