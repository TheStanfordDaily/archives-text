# Farm Parade Celebrates S.C. Victory
## Auto Trek Down Palm Drive Invades Paly 
### 
"That's the end, folks, Stanford
13— S.C. 7."
As those joyous words buzzed
out from campus radios Saturday
afternoon, bedlam broke loose on
the Farm.
Bat from out of the chaos, sud
denly, spontaneously, there burst
forth a triumphal parade, a victory \
march that celebrated the end of
the Trojan's six-year domination of
the Stanford Indian.
Big Bell Tolls
From up Lasuen, sounded forth
Ihe honking of horns, the ringing of
the Phi Delt bell—the serpentine of i
automobiles had begun. Down the j
Row started the proccssion, the bells, ;
the noise calling more and more ]
fraters and sorors to join the crowd.
Up to Roble the parade went
where cars, by the dozen, swung j
into line.
No one was immune to the .spirit j
ot the occasion. Professors stood on 1
street corners to smile and v/ave; I
little- groups of the sophisticated ,
''800" crowded! running-boards— ;
screamed, cheered. On went the j
serpentine—right through the Bull
Pen. Encinamen, .slightly dazed ai
first, rushed for cars as the parade
reached the front of the building.
Off for Paly
Someone shouted, '"Let's go to
Paly!" Immediately the troop of
cars —spider Fords, ritzy sedans, that I
blue Packard phaeton, hundreds of
them—turned down Palm Drive,
Paly ward.
Across El Camino Real went the
procession. North-south traffic
stopped, startled. Paly was '
alarmed. An Armistice Day pa
rade earlier in the day was peace
ful by comparison.
Stanford had the run of the road, !
and nothing crossed University ave- I
nue. Matrons frowned on sidewalks;
shouting kids hopped autos: thought;
the whole thing was "great." Still
the cars kept coming. Now Sequoia
High had joined the throng.
Double Line ol" Cars
The parade circled a block, and
turned up University. A double line
of Stanford cars—one going campus
ward, the other into Paly—com
pletely paralyzed other activity on
city streets.
A cop stepped in for a moment.
Then the serpentine went on. Back
on the campus, the slight order of
the procession was dissipated. The
parade was over; yet for an hour,
horns honked, automobiles sped
1 through the streets. The S.C. jinx
was broken!

High had joined the throng.
Double Line ol" Cars
The parade circled a block, and
turned up University. A double line
of Stanford cars—one going campus
ward, the other into Paly—com
pletely paralyzed other activity on
city streets.
A cop stepped in for a moment.
Then the serpentine went on. Back
on the campus, the slight order of
the procession was dissipated. The
parade was over; yet for an hour,
horns honked, automobiles sped
1 through the streets. The S.C. jinx
was broken!
"That's the end, folks, Stanford
13— S.C. 7."
As those joyous words buzzed
out from campus radios Saturday
afternoon, bedlam broke loose on
the Farm.
Bat from out of the chaos, sud
denly, spontaneously, there burst
forth a triumphal parade, a victory \
march that celebrated the end of
the Trojan's six-year domination of
the Stanford Indian.
Big Bell Tolls
From up Lasuen, sounded forth
Ihe honking of horns, the ringing of
the Phi Delt bell—the serpentine of i
automobiles had begun. Down the j
Row started the proccssion, the bells, ;
the noise calling more and more ]
fraters and sorors to join the crowd.
Up to Roble the parade went
where cars, by the dozen, swung j
into line.
No one was immune to the .spirit j
ot the occasion. Professors stood on 1
street corners to smile and v/ave; I
little- groups of the sophisticated ,
''800" crowded! running-boards— ;
screamed, cheered. On went the j
serpentine—right through the Bull
Pen. Encinamen, .slightly dazed ai
first, rushed for cars as the parade
reached the front of the building.
Off for Paly
Someone shouted, '"Let's go to
Paly!" Immediately the troop of
cars —spider Fords, ritzy sedans, that I
blue Packard phaeton, hundreds of
them—turned down Palm Drive,
Paly ward.
Across El Camino Real went the
procession. North-south traffic
stopped, startled. Paly was '
alarmed. An Armistice Day pa
rade earlier in the day was peace
ful by comparison.
Stanford had the run of the road, !
and nothing crossed University ave- I
nue. Matrons frowned on sidewalks;
shouting kids hopped autos: thought;
the whole thing was "great." Still
the cars kept coming. Now Sequoia
High had joined the throng.
