# '26 Marked Last Card Victory Over Trojans
## 
### 
Six times in six years the Trojan
i licked the Indian. Six times Stan
| ford's hopes for a win over S.C.
i have been shattered. The Cards won
last in 1926, a slim 13-12 victory,
j then:
1927: Stanford entered the game
j or. the long end of 5-4.odds, boast
ing of Post and Robcsky, future all—
i American guards, only to have
iMorley Drury play them off their
! fei t during the first three quarters.
Flcifhacker saved the game for
j Stanford with a last-minute pass to
I Vincent i. Stanford 13, U.S.C. 13.
1928: Favored by 5-4 odds, an un
manned conference fecord, and again
| with Post, Robcsky, Wilton, and
Hoffman, Pop Warner could be al
! most sure of victory. The Indians
totaled more yarda'ge, but fumbled
at crucial points. Stanford 0, U.S.
C. 13.
1929: U.S.C. pulled a predicted
toss-up out of the fire with a short
pass, Dufficld to Tappaun. Stanford
muffed two first quarter chances to
j score, and never got the ball far be-
I vend midfield during the remainder
it the fray. Stanford (), U.S.C. 7.
1930: S.C. was a heavy favorite
j with ill, sport fans when it kicked

oft to an under-dog, but, confident,
Stanford team. Troy out-ran, out
passed, out-kickcd the Cards. Stan
ford 12, U.S.C. 41.
1931: With a fighting chance to win
but with the odds 2'to 1 for S.C.,
Stanford hoped Moffat, backfield
ace, would last at least three periods.
Moffat was injured on the first play,
and the Trojans tore up Stanford's
defense. Stanford 0., U.S.C. 19,
1932: Stanford was favored by
10-7 odds and the best Warner of
fense in history. The Trojans
struck twice and scored twice. Cad
del. Hillman, and Sim led a Stan
ford attack that threatened but once.
Stanford 0, U.S.C. 13.
1933: Rosenburg, Grififths, Palmer,
Warburton, and Stevens were back
to smear the Cards for a third time.
Stanford's sole proven star was Cor
dis, all-American guard. The sopho
more preponderance of the re
mainder of their first eleven allowed
the Stanford rooters to be only du
bious, hopeful. The sophomores out
fought and out-played the Trojan
greats to let Grayson score. Corbus"
two field goals provided the winning
margin. At last—Stanford 13, U.S.
