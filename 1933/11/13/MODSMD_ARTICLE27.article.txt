# "Rediscovered" Van Dellen Shares Game Honors With Grayson
## COAST FANS REJOICE All-American Corbus Kicks Two Field Goals 
### Spud Hamilton (Daily Sports Editor 
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 12.—Sopho
mores that vowed they would never
be beaten by Southern California
completed the first leg of their three
year vigil Saturday, but it took the
toe of all-American Bill Corbus to
cinch this "new deal" for Stanford.
In turning back El Trojan, who
had reigned through a 27-game pe
riod as King of American football,
Coach Tiny Thornhill today had un
covered a brilliant new left half
back, "Buck" Van Dellen, who
played an important part in Stan
ford's thrilling, long-looked-for vic
tory, 13 to 7, over University of
Southern California here yesterday.

Van Dellen, who has been hang
ing around for years doing himself
little good in the interval, entered
the game in the second quarter after
Bob Maentz, the starter, had tired
because he had not had time to gel
in shape after his injuries in the
Washington game.
Van Dellen wasted little time.
Early in the period Cal Clemens
kicked out of bounds for S.C. on the
Stanford 33, the point from where
Stanford started its now historic 67-
yatd touchdown drive. Grayson
went 2, 16, and 2 yards in three tries.
"Bones" Hamilton cut through tackle
four yards, and then Grayson flipped
a pass to Van Dellen who raced to
the Trojan 26 before Bright nailed
him. The Stanford attack was on.
Grayson Pass Good
Again Van Dellen came through.
This time, Grayson faded back from
ihe 26-yard line, threw to Van Del
len who was on ihe Trojan 20-yard
stripe. The new find bumped into a
Southern Californian, finally eluded
him and started down the field into
the clear. Just as it appeared he
had regained his balance, h6 slipper!
and crashed to the turf on the 12-
yard line.
Grayson followed up with a 6-yard
1 gain around right end. Hamilton
drove through center to the 2'/>-
yard line, and Grayson made it a
first down one yard from the goal.
On the next play he went over, giv
ing Stanford the first touchdown it
had scored against S.C. in three
years. Incidentally, it was the first
I touchdown scored against U.S.C. on
sheer power since late in 1931, when
Tulane pushed through the well
nigh impregnable wall of Troy.
"Comeback Spirit"'
The touchdown, which showed a
',reat comeback spirit after Coach
Howard Jones' boys iiad .started
things conspicuously in the first pe
riod by scoring on Warburton's bril
liant 43-yard run, sent the stands
into a violent uproar. Eleven hun
ched fifty sons of Stanford, some of
whom were late arrivals because ol'
the five-hour delay of the rooters
train south of Watsonville, broke
loose with a contagious hysteria
which rapidly spread through the
80,000 spectators. They sensed U.
S.C.'s downfall.
Warburton's run, almost a dupli
cate of his winning dash against
California two weeks ago, came in
the first period. Frank Alustiza, the
booming Basque, quick-kicked out
of bounds on the Trojan 45.
The Cottonhead lost a yard as his
interference failed him, Griffith
drove for a yard and Clemens
punted, but the play was called back
and U.S.C. given possession on Stan
ford's 43 when Norgard, Card end,
was called for illegal clipping on the
punt.
Warburton Scores
On the next play, Warburton shot
through left tackle, outsprinted his
opposition and pulled up over the
goal line. Clemens added the extra
point from placement, and the Tro
jans led. 7 to 0.
Back came the Indians with their
second quarter touchdown, with Bill
Corbus place-kicking the extra point
and bringing from the stands that
well-known sigh of relief.
The second half was all Stanford,
with the Reds approaching the goal
line twice only to have Corbus' at
tempted place kicks go wide. It
looked like the same old goal line
bugaboo, and when Troy began to
resort to passes, the Card rooting
.section sank back, awaiting the score
that the Trojans seemed sure to
make.
Straight Football
Stanford stuck to straight foot
bali, using reverses rarely and never
lateralling. The end-around play,
which "Monk" Moscrip constantly
practiced last week, was used only
once, but then the tough end broke
around the Trojan defense and tore
oft 30 yards, placing the ball in posi
tion for Corbus' place kick that put
Stanford ahead, 10 to 7, late in the
fourth period.
Moscrip's run completely fooled
the U.S.C. defense and once again
sparked up Stanford's hopes. They
hogged down a moment latex-, how
ever, when Southern California's
line stopped Stanford cold on the
10-yard stripe and took the ball
on downs. But the hopes were
buoyed on the next play when Van
Dellen intercepted Griffith's pass and
ran 19 yards to the Trojan 35.
Hamilton and Grayson made a
first down on the 23, and a neat pass
to A1 Norgard on the 15-yard line.
With fourth down and two yards to
go on the 15, Corbus was called back
for the place-kick that sewed up the
results.
Corbus Place-Kicks
Corbus tried two others earlier in
the half, both being limp. The first
came shortly before the end of the
third quarter, from the 10-yard line,
directly in front of the goal posts.
It was low. Three plays after the
fourth period opened, he tried an
i other, this time from the 25, but it
was short.
The third time was the charm,
and just to show people he wasn't
consistently inconsistent, Corbus
booted a second good goal for Stan
ford in the dying minutes of the
I game, sending the pigskin through
the uprights from a difficult angle
on the 13-yard line.
Moscrip, Hamilton, Alustiza, Cor
bus, Callaway, and Reynolds did
I some 'brilliant work for Thornhill,
! smashing down Trojan threats.

Stanford 0 7 0 6—13
Southern California .... 7 0 0 0— 7
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 12.—Sopho
mores that vowed they would never
be beaten by Southern California
completed the first leg of their three
year vigil Saturday, but it took the
toe of all-American Bill Corbus to
cinch this "new deal" for Stanford.
In turning back El Trojan, who
had reigned through a 27-game pe
riod as King of American football,
Coach Tiny Thornhill today had un
covered a brilliant new left half
back, "Buck" Van Dellen, who
played an important part in Stan
ford's thrilling, long-looked-for vic
tory, 13 to 7, over University of
Southern California here yesterday.

Van Dellen, who has been hang
ing around for years doing himself
little good in the interval, entered
the game in the second quarter after
Bob Maentz, the starter, had tired
because he had not had time to gel
in shape after his injuries in the
Washington game.
Van Dellen wasted little time.
Early in the period Cal Clemens
kicked out of bounds for S.C. on the
Stanford 33, the point from where
Stanford started its now historic 67-
yatd touchdown drive. Grayson
went 2, 16, and 2 yards in three tries.
"Bones" Hamilton cut through tackle
four yards, and then Grayson flipped
a pass to Van Dellen who raced to
the Trojan 26 before Bright nailed
him. The Stanford attack was on.
Grayson Pass Good
Again Van Dellen came through.
This time, Grayson faded back from
ihe 26-yard line, threw to Van Del
len who was on ihe Trojan 20-yard
stripe. The new find bumped into a
Southern Californian, finally eluded
him and started down the field into
the clear. Just as it appeared he
had regained his balance, h6 slipper!
and crashed to the turf on the 12-
yard line.
Grayson followed up with a 6-yard
1 gain around right end. Hamilton
drove through center to the 2'/>-
yard line, and Grayson made it a
first down one yard from the goal.
On the next play he went over, giv
ing Stanford the first touchdown it
had scored against S.C. in three
years. Incidentally, it was the first
I touchdown scored against U.S.C. on
sheer power since late in 1931, when
Tulane pushed through the well
nigh impregnable wall of Troy.
"Comeback Spirit"'
The touchdown, which showed a
',reat comeback spirit after Coach
Howard Jones' boys iiad .started
things conspicuously in the first pe
riod by scoring on Warburton's bril
liant 43-yard run, sent the stands
into a violent uproar. Eleven hun
ched fifty sons of Stanford, some of
whom were late arrivals because ol'
the five-hour delay of the rooters
train south of Watsonville, broke
loose with a contagious hysteria
which rapidly spread through the
80,000 spectators. They sensed U.
S.C.'s downfall.
Warburton's run, almost a dupli
cate of his winning dash against
California two weeks ago, came in
the first period. Frank Alustiza, the
booming Basque, quick-kicked out
of bounds on the Trojan 45.
The Cottonhead lost a yard as his
interference failed him, Griffith
drove for a yard and Clemens
punted, but the play was called back
and U.S.C. given possession on Stan
ford's 43 when Norgard, Card end,
was called for illegal clipping on the
punt.
Warburton Scores
On the next play, Warburton shot
through left tackle, outsprinted his
opposition and pulled up over the
goal line. Clemens added the extra
point from placement, and the Tro
jans led. 7 to 0.
Back came the Indians with their
second quarter touchdown, with Bill
Corbus place-kicking the extra point
and bringing from the stands that
well-known sigh of relief.
The second half was all Stanford,
with the Reds approaching the goal
line twice only to have Corbus' at
tempted place kicks go wide. It
looked like the same old goal line
bugaboo, and when Troy began to
resort to passes, the Card rooting
.section sank back, awaiting the score
that the Trojans seemed sure to
make.
Straight Football
Stanford stuck to straight foot
bali, using reverses rarely and never
lateralling. The end-around play,
which "Monk" Moscrip constantly
practiced last week, was used only
once, but then the tough end broke
around the Trojan defense and tore
oft 30 yards, placing the ball in posi
tion for Corbus' place kick that put
Stanford ahead, 10 to 7, late in the
fourth period.
Moscrip's run completely fooled
the U.S.C. defense and once again
sparked up Stanford's hopes. They
hogged down a moment latex-, how
ever, when Southern California's
line stopped Stanford cold on the
10-yard stripe and took the ball
on downs. But the hopes were
buoyed on the next play when Van
Dellen intercepted Griffith's pass and
ran 19 yards to the Trojan 35.
Hamilton and Grayson made a
first down on the 23, and a neat pass
to A1 Norgard on the 15-yard line.
With fourth down and two yards to
go on the 15, Corbus was called back
for the place-kick that sewed up the
results.
Corbus Place-Kicks
Corbus tried two others earlier in
the half, both being limp. The first
came shortly before the end of the
third quarter, from the 10-yard line,
directly in front of the goal posts.
It was low. Three plays after the
fourth period opened, he tried an
i other, this time from the 25, but it
was short.
The third time was the charm,
and just to show people he wasn't
consistently inconsistent, Corbus
booted a second good goal for Stan
ford in the dying minutes of the
I game, sending the pigskin through
the uprights from a difficult angle
on the 13-yard line.
Moscrip, Hamilton, Alustiza, Cor
bus, Callaway, and Reynolds did

Stanford 0 7 0 6—13
Southern California .... 7 0 0 0— 7
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 12.—Sopho
mores that vowed they would never
be beaten by Southern California
completed the first leg of their three
year vigil Saturday, but it took the
toe of all-American Bill Corbus to
cinch this "new deal" for Stanford.
In turning back El Trojan, who
had reigned through a 27-game pe
riod as King of American football,
Coach Tiny Thornhill today had un
covered a brilliant new left half
back, "Buck" Van Dellen, who
played an important part in Stan
ford's thrilling, long-looked-for vic
tory, 13 to 7, over University of
Southern California here yesterday.

Van Dellen, who has been hang
ing around for years doing himself
little good in the interval, entered
the game in the second quarter after
Bob Maentz, the starter, had tired
because he had not had time to gel
in shape after his injuries in the
Washington game.
Van Dellen wasted little time.
Early in the period Cal Clemens
kicked out of bounds for S.C. on the
Stanford 33, the point from where
Stanford started its now historic 67-
yatd touchdown drive. Grayson
went 2, 16, and 2 yards in three tries.
"Bones" Hamilton cut through tackle
four yards, and then Grayson flipped
a pass to Van Dellen who raced to
the Trojan 26 before Bright nailed
him. The Stanford attack was on.
Grayson Pass Good
Again Van Dellen came through.
This time, Grayson faded back from
ihe 26-yard line, threw to Van Del
len who was on ihe Trojan 20-yard
stripe. The new find bumped into a
Southern Californian, finally eluded
him and started down the field into
the clear. Just as it appeared he
had regained his balance, h6 slipper!
and crashed to the turf on the 12-
yard line.
Grayson followed up with a 6-yard
1 gain around right end. Hamilton
drove through center to the 2'/>-
yard line, and Grayson made it a
first down one yard from the goal.
On the next play he went over, giv
ing Stanford the first touchdown it
had scored against S.C. in three
years. Incidentally, it was the first
I touchdown scored against U.S.C. on
sheer power since late in 1931, when
Tulane pushed through the well
nigh impregnable wall of Troy.
"Comeback Spirit"'
The touchdown, which showed a
',reat comeback spirit after Coach
Howard Jones' boys iiad .started
things conspicuously in the first pe
riod by scoring on Warburton's bril
liant 43-yard run, sent the stands
into a violent uproar. Eleven hun
ched fifty sons of Stanford, some of
whom were late arrivals because ol'
the five-hour delay of the rooters
train south of Watsonville, broke
loose with a contagious hysteria
which rapidly spread through the
80,000 spectators. They sensed U.
S.C.'s downfall.
Warburton's run, almost a dupli
cate of his winning dash against
California two weeks ago, came in
the first period. Frank Alustiza, the
booming Basque, quick-kicked out
of bounds on the Trojan 45.
The Cottonhead lost a yard as his
interference failed him, Griffith
drove for a yard and Clemens
punted, but the play was called back
and U.S.C. given possession on Stan
ford's 43 when Norgard, Card end,
was called for illegal clipping on the
punt.
Warburton Scores
On the next play, Warburton shot
through left tackle, outsprinted his
opposition and pulled up over the
goal line. Clemens added the extra
point from placement, and the Tro
jans led. 7 to 0.
Back came the Indians with their
second quarter touchdown, with Bill
Corbus place-kicking the extra point
and bringing from the stands that
well-known sigh of relief.
The second half was all Stanford,
with the Reds approaching the goal
line twice only to have Corbus' at
tempted place kicks go wide. It
looked like the same old goal line
bugaboo, and when Troy began to
resort to passes, the Card rooting
.section sank back, awaiting the score
that the Trojans seemed sure to
make.
Straight Football
Stanford stuck to straight foot
bali, using reverses rarely and never
lateralling. The end-around play,
which "Monk" Moscrip constantly
practiced last week, was used only
once, but then the tough end broke
around the Trojan defense and tore
oft 30 yards, placing the ball in posi
tion for Corbus' place kick that put
Stanford ahead, 10 to 7, late in the
fourth period.
Moscrip's run completely fooled
the U.S.C. defense and once again
sparked up Stanford's hopes. They
hogged down a moment latex-, how
ever, when Southern California's
line stopped Stanford cold on the
10-yard stripe and took the ball
on downs. But the hopes were
buoyed on the next play when Van
Dellen intercepted Griffith's pass and
ran 19 yards to the Trojan 35.
Hamilton and Grayson made a
first down on the 23, and a neat pass
to A1 Norgard on the 15-yard line.
With fourth down and two yards to
go on the 15, Corbus was called back
for the place-kick that sewed up the
results.
Corbus Place-Kicks
Corbus tried two others earlier in
the half, both being limp. The first
came shortly before the end of the
third quarter, from the 10-yard line,
directly in front of the goal posts.
It was low. Three plays after the
fourth period opened, he tried an

and just to show people he wasn't

to A1 Norgard on the 15-yard line.
With fourth down and two yards to
go on the 15, Corbus was called back
for the place-kick that sewed up the
results.
Corbus Place-Kicks
Corbus tried two others earlier in
the half, both being limp. The first
came shortly before the end of the
third quarter, from the 10-yard line,
directly in front of the goal posts.
It was low. Three plays after the
fourth period opened, he tried an
i other, this time from the 25, but it
was short.
The third time was the charm,
and just to show people he wasn't
consistently inconsistent, Corbus
booted a second good goal for Stan
ford in the dying minutes of the
I game, sending the pigskin through
the uprights from a difficult angle
on the 13-yard line.
Moscrip, Hamilton, Alustiza, Cor
bus, Callaway, and Reynolds did
I some 'brilliant work for Thornhill,
! smashing down Trojan threats.
