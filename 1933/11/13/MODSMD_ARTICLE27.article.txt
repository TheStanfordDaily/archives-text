LOS ANGELES, Nov. 12.—Sopho
mores that vowed they would never
be beaten by Southern California
completed the first leg of their three
year vigil Saturday, but it took the
toe of all-American Bill Corbus to
cinch this "new deal" for Stanford.
In turning back El Trojan, who
had reigned through a 27-game pe
riod as King of American football,
Coach Tiny Thornhill today had un
covered a brilliant new left half
back, "Buck" Van Dellen, who
played an important part in Stan
ford's thrilling, long-looked-for vic
tory, 13 to 7, over University of
Southern California here yesterday.

Van Dellen, who has been hang
ing around for years doing himself
little good in the interval, entered
the game in the second quarter after
Bob Maentz, the starter, had tired
because he had not had time to gel
in shape after his injuries in the
Washington game.
Van Dellen wasted little time.
Early in the period Cal Clemens
kicked out of bounds for S.C. on the
Stanford 33, the point from where
Stanford started its now historic 67-
yatd touchdown drive. Grayson
went 2, 16, and 2 yards in three tries.
"Bones" Hamilton cut through tackle
four yards, and then Grayson flipped
a pass to Van Dellen who raced to
the Trojan 26 before Bright nailed
him. The Stanford attack was on.
Grayson Pass Good
Again Van Dellen came through.
This time, Grayson faded back from
ihe 26-yard line, threw to Van Del
len who was on ihe Trojan 20-yard
stripe. The new find bumped into a
Southern Californian, finally eluded
him and started down the field into
the clear. Just as it appeared he
had regained his balance, h6 slipper!
and crashed to the turf on the 12-
yard line.
Grayson followed up with a 6-yard
1 gain around right end. Hamilton
drove through center to the 2'/>-
yard line, and Grayson made it a
first down one yard from the goal.
On the next play he went over, giv
ing Stanford the first touchdown it
had scored against S.C. in three
years. Incidentally, it was the first
I touchdown scored against U.S.C. on
sheer power since late in 1931, when
Tulane pushed through the well
nigh impregnable wall of Troy.
