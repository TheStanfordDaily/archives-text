# More Liquor Laws
## 
### 
Befuddled Governor Rolph, while
carnation in lapel, yesterday took
under advisement numerous re
quests for a special session of the
Legislature to take care of the po
tentially dangerous liquor question.
Existing regulatory machinery al
ready creaking, it is imperative that
something be done before December
5. San Francisco is already wide
c pen, other cities more or less so.
Local option repealed by a hastily
considered constitutional amend
ment last November, it now appears
certain that sharp conflict between
state and local authorities is inevi
table; has already begun. Attorney-
General Webb ruled Board of
Equalization has all power, localities
none. General trend appears to be
toward tightening, centralization of
i;tate control. Ambitious city attor
neys are busily preparing to test
j.tate law at earliest opportunity, are
conceded little chance. Meanwhile
hard liquor flows tax-free, will con
tinue to do so after repeal unless
something is done before.
