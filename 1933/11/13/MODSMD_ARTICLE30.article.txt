# On Defeating Southern California
## 
### 
If is now vcrv cold history that Stanford has defeated
Southern California. What lias been hope for six years is
now chronicled event. The seemingly invincible Trojan is
no longer invincible. In short, he is beaten.
During the lean years of unrequited hope, Stanford has
watched the Trojan serpentine and laughed. We laughed
because there was nothing else to do and because the idea
of one university winning at football with mechanical pre
cision was a bit humorous. "The best team that money can
J;uy"'; "winding electric clocks"; "scouting the nation";
"international marvels" all may have been nothing but
rooters' jokes, but they were funny just the same.
Hut Stanford suffered the Trojan taunts (one always
suffers taunts). We could always point to our high educa
tional standards, the debating team, and our dearth of
Hollywood Rah Rah-ism that made I'. S. C. and Carl
Laemmle's College Comedies such stimulating conversa
tion topics.
And now, we have won. We have still what we had;
and we have victory as well. Roth are pleasant; the latter
is a welcome addition to the former.
We never wasted any great self-pity on ourselves dur
ing the lean years. After all, defeat was not a national
tragedy. Hut now, one cannot help but sincerely pity
Southern California- not because they lost; but because of
what that defeat means to them. Football victory meant so
much to them; some cynics even said that it meant every
thing; and now that is gone. It is to mourn.
Naturally, there is happiness at Stanford. Naturally
our spirit becomes momentarily a bit boisterous at the
victory. Hut during the lean years, no one ever doubted
that the student body's loyalty to the Alma Mater was one
v. hit less. We took a keen joy in the I'niversity; winning
or losing at football was most incidental. That is as it
should be.
Never did our leaders have to lather themselves and
the Campus for a great spirit-building campaign. Such at
tempts would have been laughed off the Campus. Hut that
is the order of the day at I'.S.C. Recently student leaders
there were quoted: "Where is that Ti'ojan Spirit?" "Those
who are responsible for guarding and gilding the Trojan
spirit are taking a little time oft'," etc. What this defeat
will do to Trojan spirit is indeed horrifying to contemplate.
Of course, some red-blooded blue-nosers will ask if this
is the proper spirit for a winning school. No, it isn't, of
course. Hut one really pities S.C. In fact, we almost xvish
tliev had won. They would have had such fun with it.
Hut the present result: Stanford 1 ii, t'.S.C. 7, does warm
the Stanford heart.

tliev had won. They would have had such fun with it.
Hut the present result: Stanford 1 ii, t'.S.C. 7, does warm
the Stanford heart.
If is now vcrv cold history that Stanford has defeated
Southern California. What lias been hope for six years is
now chronicled event. The seemingly invincible Trojan is
no longer invincible. In short, he is beaten.
During the lean years of unrequited hope, Stanford has
watched the Trojan serpentine and laughed. We laughed
because there was nothing else to do and because the idea
of one university winning at football with mechanical pre
cision was a bit humorous. "The best team that money can
J;uy"'; "winding electric clocks"; "scouting the nation";
"international marvels" all may have been nothing but
rooters' jokes, but they were funny just the same.
Hut Stanford suffered the Trojan taunts (one always
suffers taunts). We could always point to our high educa
tional standards, the debating team, and our dearth of
Hollywood Rah Rah-ism that made I'. S. C. and Carl
Laemmle's College Comedies such stimulating conversa
tion topics.
And now, we have won. We have still what we had;
and we have victory as well. Roth are pleasant; the latter
is a welcome addition to the former.
We never wasted any great self-pity on ourselves dur
ing the lean years. After all, defeat was not a national
tragedy. Hut now, one cannot help but sincerely pity
Southern California- not because they lost; but because of
what that defeat means to them. Football victory meant so
much to them; some cynics even said that it meant every
thing; and now that is gone. It is to mourn.
Naturally, there is happiness at Stanford. Naturally
our spirit becomes momentarily a bit boisterous at the
victory. Hut during the lean years, no one ever doubted
that the student body's loyalty to the Alma Mater was one
v. hit less. We took a keen joy in the I'niversity; winning
or losing at football was most incidental. That is as it
should be.
Never did our leaders have to lather themselves and
the Campus for a great spirit-building campaign. Such at
tempts would have been laughed off the Campus. Hut that
is the order of the day at I'.S.C. Recently student leaders
there were quoted: "Where is that Ti'ojan Spirit?" "Those
who are responsible for guarding and gilding the Trojan
spirit are taking a little time oft'," etc. What this defeat
will do to Trojan spirit is indeed horrifying to contemplate.
Of course, some red-blooded blue-nosers will ask if this
is the proper spirit for a winning school. No, it isn't, of
course. Hut one really pities S.C. In fact, we almost xvish
tliev had won. They would have had such fun with it.
