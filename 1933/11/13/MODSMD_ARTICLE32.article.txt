Staid, conservative Stanford amended momentarily an
c>l tic!' old tradition late Saturday afternoon, when news
was flashed around that (loach Tiny Thornhill's football
team had done the impossible, aehieved a goal sought by
many, beaten down the walls of Troy.
I)(^fvihl»" all thoughts about extreme "anti-collcgiatism,"
the slav-at-homes actually gave vent to their feelings and
for a brief period became most exuberant. And we ask,
"Why not?" The idea of being individualists is fine, but
there is no sane reason for being smothered under a blan
ket of conservatism all the time.
If Stanford does something, such as Stanford did Sat
urday, it's great to break loose and thumb your nose at
convention. You feel better for speaking your piece. And
so do those around you.
The Daily isn't encouraging the idea of going hoteha
any time that somebody can find an excuse. Hut spontane
ous expression of spirit is splendid. Student leaders, past
and present, who have sponsored today's victory rally at
the depot have taken the right attitude. But the attempts
of some to keep us at fever heat perpetually are amusing.
The Daily staff will meet todav at 1:15 o'clock.
