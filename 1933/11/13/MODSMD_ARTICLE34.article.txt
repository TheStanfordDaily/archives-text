## THE 						FREE PRESS: TEARS AND JEERS 
### 
For years the yellowness, the
| propaganda, and the omissions of
, the national press have caused in
telligent people to stop reading their
papers at breakfast. Food and the:
j press have proved a nauseating com
' bination.
I
When fearlessness was needed, the
jellyfish became the mascot of the
newspapers. When liberalism was
! called for, choking, musty, dusty
! reactionism was the answer. When
| news was demanded, sex, bias, and
j sensationalism slithered off the na
! tion's presses. When style was ut
terly lacking, bespectacled peda
i gegues dictated more and more of
I the simple, disgusting "who, whens,
j and wheres."
%
The free press has been a reality
I —free to suppress the news, dis
color the facts, diddle the national
intellect, disgust the reading public.
Now the stupid, satisfied smug
ness of the national dailies is threat
jened. Columbia Broadcasting Com
i pany has suddenly broken into the
news, sliced through the backward
walls of journalism, and shown itself
to be fairly successful at open field
running. Columbia News Service,
; Inc., holds a real threat to the con
tinued mass circulation of the mon
■ gers of news—fried, broiled, and
| roasted. Now the haughty, self
satisfied press is down on its knees,

I pouring forth a salty stream of
crocodile tears, begging that Colum
bia's youngest brainchild be put to
the sword.
"Edith and Publisher," voice of
the press, moans that Columbia's
primary purpose is to sell time on
the air to advertisers —not to give
the public its news. Public sneers
as it recalls the columns of guff that
toady to "out advertisers." Public
is embittered as it realizes what the
free press does with its real news— t
how it fails to expose graft or pe- '
culating public officials, when such
things will "hurt our advertisers."
Voice of The Press appeals to
Americans for support in its fight
I against the Voice of the Air. Radio
listeners (though almost equally dis
gusted with ether programs) see no
reason to stir from easy chairs and
come to the aid of the paper. They '
have no assurance that broadcasted
news will be of any higher quality
than printed news; they know it
would be difficult to discover much
worse. So they sit back, grin, and
hope that they will profit.
The decent press will not suffer I
unless the unexpected happens—and
the radio becomes decent. If there
must be sufferance, it is mostly de
served. The free press has admin
istered its own knock-cut drops.
Ri.nd.s will play at the funeral!
