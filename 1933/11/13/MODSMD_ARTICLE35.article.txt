I Wholesale manufacturer demands
for embargoes were expected to fol
low in wake of NRA codes, increased
costs. Worried officials were re
lieved that only six demands have
so far been received. Reason: F.R.'s
! policy of deliberately depreciating
dollar in foreign markets, giving
U.S. added, unexpected leeway.
The Administration policy, re
garding embargoing, has not yet
been announced. Official opinion
j generally has been that there would
bo no tariff upping, save where it
was clear that domestic industry
could not pay NRA wages and sur
vive. Still faced with stagnant fol
ic ign trade, importers breathed more
! esiily.
