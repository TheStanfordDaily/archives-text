THE PRIVATE LIFE OF HENRY
YIII (London. Films-United
Artists)
At tlu- Columbia Theatre
This is a good and amusing if not
sensationally fine film. It details,
with necessary haste in view of the
amount of material to be covered,
the domestic relations of the virile
Henry of England with five of bio
six wives.
The earlier portions of the film are
somewhat disconcertingly dependent
upon the comedy arising from an
achronism which poses unconvinc
ingly as universality. A wife, viewing
Anne Boleyn's execution, chides her
husband for not purchasing her a
frock of the latest style.
But, the halfway mark passed,
Laughton is not called upon to re
flect that the manners of the time
r.'-t execrable while throwing chunks
of capon over his shouider, and rises
above low if funny gaggery to fine
acting, a notable instance of which
is his broken-hearted reception of
proof that Kathryn Howard has
cuckolded him.
The film makes no attempt to
show Henry as a statesman, confin
ing him to the dining hall, the bed
room, and the hunt. But within
these limits and utilizing them to the
full for the comedy inherent in
them, it has been admirably con
trived.
It has been said that this is, tech
nically, the best film yet to come
out of England. JThis is an observa
tion of dubious value. For England
has not yet managed to approach
either the smoothness or the imagi
native quality of the best American
films.
Therefore, when an abrupt view
of towers appears, it is obvious that
the shot is one of historical curiosity
but limited artistry; further, the dis
crepancy between this type of shot
end, for instance, that of Ann of i
Cleves and her lover from below
and behind a row of sunflowers'
points out particularly the difference
between blank fact and self-consci
ous artistry.
It should be noted, however, that
the scenes within the court were
laudably authentic and at least a
few of the "artistic" views eminently
fine: Henry's ride across the fields
as he learns of his son's birth; the
band of horsemen crossing London
Bridge.
Laughton's performance is fine.
He portrays a curiously naive man,
childishly tempestuous of temper.
And although the director has hur
ried over Henry's later years rather
too rapidly, Laughton has been able 1
to make the monarch age naturally.
The most touching scene in the film
(excepting perhaps that before the
council which has accused Katheryn
Howard) is that in which the re
nowned but aged monarch sits
quietly under the annoyed twang of
his last wife's tongue, blinking,
shaking—and slobbers over a piecc
of meat.
The film is a comic history with
those few serious moments which

are necessary to show more of the
king than moments of hearty in- \
dulgence and amusingly petulant .
temper can. And it is a film which,''
despite the wild gesticulations of ■
press-agentry, i.s worth seeing.
