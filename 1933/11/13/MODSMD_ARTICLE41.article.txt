# Fumbles Cost Frosh Little Big Game
## CUBS VICTORS 19-14; VIGNA RACES 102 YARDS FOR SCORE 
### Dick Strouse 
Smashing off-tackle in sparkling
4-yard dashes and returning dropped
punts for glorious 2-yard gains,
Stanford's freshman football boys
fumbled their way to respectable
14 to 19 loss against California Sat
urday before 307 yawning spectators
who were thrilled only by Joe Vig
na's lengthy touchdown gallop and
flashes from the S.C.-Stanford brawl
in Los Angeles.
The non - professional Stanford
yearlings played a fair game of
weedy or garden variety of football,
and scored first when Hal Elder,
starting left end, fell on a blocked
California punt behind the Cubs,
goal-line early in the first quarter.
Fred Williams, injured halfback and
field goal expert, entered the game
momentarily to make the conversion
good and then returned to the bench
to philosophize upon the cruelty of it
all and watch Coach "Rabbit" Brad
shaw pace nervously up and down
in his natty black suit.
Passes Like Sobrero
The Cubs matched Stanford's
touchdown when Newson, lanky
California half who runs like
Frenchy Lacombe and passes like
Santa Clara's Sobrero, threw a lon%
one to Cosca of California and Tur
retto of Stanford which Cosca
grabbed over the goal-line. Captain
Dale Beedle, who played GO hard
minutes of hard football for the Pa
pooses, blocked the conversion at
tempt to give Stanford first-half
honors, 7 to 6.
Stanford's perspiring line, that had
outcharged the Cubs during the first
two periods, weakened in the sec
ond half, California marching to a
touchdown once in the third quar
ter and almost doing it again until
Beedle personally stopped the charge
by breaking through on his 1-yard
line to throw the Cub runner for a
6-yard loss.
More Newson and noxious passes
gave U.C. a first down on the Stan
ford 3-yard marker, and the ex
pected third Cub touchdown re
sulted. The conversion was good to
put Stanford behind 7 to 19.
"Vigna's Last Ride"
Whereupon little Joe Vigna, Card
quarterback, caught California's
kick-off behind his goal-line, fum
bled, picked up the ball, cut for the
sideline, and scampered the length
of the field to score. Estimates of
th run vary from 102 to 110 yards,
Vigna being chased by a big limp
ing Cub lineman the last 50 yards
and collapsing as he lay in the
striped end zone with ball hugged
to his damp middle. Schott con
verted.
Chuck Ledbetter, giant, smashing
Papoose fullback, almost earned a
victory for Stanford when he broke
through for 40 yards and a clear
field on the old "bootlegger" play,
but Ledbetter was tackled just be
fore the gun sounded. The an
nouncer, whose grammatical errors
and weird pronunciations lent spice
to a dull afternoon, said it was a
"bootlegger" play and the announcer
.should know.
Some Dumb Plays
The game throughout was marked
by the foolish football which fresh
men who are trying to win and
sometimes forget what they have
been taught usually play. Punts and
kick-offÂ» that traveled far over the
goal-line were run back rather than
touched down and brought safely
to the 20-yard strip; both teams
picked up fumbles rather than fall
on them; and Stanford made some
nine fumbles during the afternoon.
The defeat was neither a dispi'oof
of Stanford's educational standing
nor a repudiation of freshman foot
ball prowess, as the game was con
sidered a tossup. Jack Walton, f(fr
merly a guard, played a fine defen
sive game at half for the Indians
and Grigo Turretto, Walton's run
ning mate, filled in for Williams in
adequate and pleasing fashion.
Louis Tsoutsouvas (pronounced
' Choo-choo-vas") played most of
