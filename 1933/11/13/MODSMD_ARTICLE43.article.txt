# STATISTICS SHOW CARDS SUPERIOR
## 
### 
Statistics, as well as the final
; score, show Stanford was superior
i to Southern California Saturday in
I nearly every department. Indian
1 runners gained more ground, a
j greater percentage of Stanford
f passes were completed, and the
Cardinals averaged more distance on
punts.
Stanford totaled 11 first downs, 8
I of which were from running plays
and 3 from passes. Troy bucked
the Cai'dinal line for but 2 first
downs, made 4 more through the
air, and 4 by penalties for a total
of 10.
Six Out of Seven
The Indians attempted 7 forward
passes and completed 6 of these for
! a net gain of 67 yards. Howard
i Jones' squad completed 7 out of 13
passes for 70 yards. The Trojans
lost 2 passes by interception.
Stanford's net gain from scrim
mage was 174 1 /' yards, while U.S.C.
tallied but 106 yards from running
plays.
Card Punting Better
With an average of 35 7-9 yarels
[on each punt, Stanford's kicking de-
I partment was shown to be stronger
than that of the defending charn
j pions, who averaged 21 2-9 yards.
: Both teams kicked 9 times.
I The fumbles were evenly divided.
! The Cards fumbled three times and
i recovered twice; U.S.C. duplicated
j this.
Five penalties set the victors back
30 yards, while 3 penalties against
the Trojans offset 20 yards of this.
Moscrip's Average High
Bobby Grayson did the main
Stanford ball-carrying. He handled
(he oval 24 times and averaged 2.87
i yards. Bones Hamilton carried the
ball 14 times for a 3.32-yard average.
Monk Moscrip, who carried the pig
i skin but once, made 31 yards on
that tiy.
Cotton Warburton, with an aver
age of 4.43 yards for .16 attempts,
led the Troy backfield, while Propst,
i who carried the ball 7 times, was
second with an average of 4.14 yards.
I il
!Ihe game at left tackle, and Tsout
; somas (pronounced "Chuck-cha
vus") and Beedle will bear wat'ch
' ing next year. Bald Jack Geisen,
Paul Spennatta, Ray Williamson,
I ar.d Sterling Cottrell played guard,
and all worked well with Tsoutsou
jvas (pronounced "Trout-tsou-vus").
The punting of Randell of Califor-
I nia was a thing of beauty and a joy
| forever, the Cub averaging over 40
' yards including one of 65 yards and
j one of but 17. The audience exhi-
I bited its greatest enthusiasm during
I the secopd quarter when a Stanford
j substitution resulted in much ap
! plause. An outburst of cheering in
dicated that one of the two boys
| boasts a large family, all of whom

Card Punting Better
With an average of 35 7-9 yarels
[on each punt, Stanford's kicking de-
I partment was shown to be stronger
than that of the defending charn
j pions, who averaged 21 2-9 yards.
: Both teams kicked 9 times.
I The fumbles were evenly divided.
! The Cards fumbled three times and
i recovered twice; U.S.C. duplicated
j this.
Five penalties set the victors back
30 yards, while 3 penalties against
the Trojans offset 20 yards of this.
Moscrip's Average High
Bobby Grayson did the main
Stanford ball-carrying. He handled
(he oval 24 times and averaged 2.87
i yards. Bones Hamilton carried the
ball 14 times for a 3.32-yard average.
Monk Moscrip, who carried the pig
i skin but once, made 31 yards on
that tiy.
Cotton Warburton, with an aver
age of 4.43 yards for .16 attempts,
led the Troy backfield, while Propst,
i who carried the ball 7 times, was
second with an average of 4.14 yards.

and all worked well with Tsoutsou

The punting of Randell of Califor-
I nia was a thing of beauty and a joy

' yards including one of 65 yards and
j one of but 17. The audience exhi-
I bited its greatest enthusiasm during
I the secopd quarter when a Stanford
j substitution resulted in much ap

dicated that one of the two boys

Statistics, as well as the final

i to Southern California Saturday in
I nearly every department. Indian
1 runners gained more ground, a

f passes were completed, and the
Cardinals averaged more distance on
punts.
Stanford totaled 11 first downs, 8
