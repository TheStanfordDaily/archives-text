Twenty-one men played perfect football for Stanford Saturday, if it is
possible to be the best of perfection. Bobby Grayson was about it. The
sophomore stalwart scored the first touchdown made against S.C. in three
years, and his passes and dashes olf tackle as well as his more conven
tional line-plunging and defensive work were instrumental in the surprise
Stanford victory. (Associated Press Photo)
