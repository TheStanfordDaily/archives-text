# GIL CARR'S FIRST GUESS WINS ENCINA SCORE PRIZE
## 
### 
When Stanford's Thornhill - re
novated Big Red Machine rolled
over S.C. on all eleven Saturday,
Gil Carr (Law grad, Encina sponsor,
Men's Councilman, victory-starved
Standfordite) was pleased. When
that rolling sounded a 13 to 7 salute
to the crazed Farm, Carr was more
than exuberant. He was richer by
$2 50.
For Gil had posted his prophecy
as to the score on the Encina score
chart. Carr's had been the first
guess of over 170 posted and Carr
called the game to a point. Re
sult: the weekly cash prize of
fered by the barbers in Encina
Hall to the man who exactly fore
casts Stanford's football score for
that Saturday went to Carr.
For seven years, friendly shavers
headed by affable Earl Springs have
offered their two-stone-four-bits to
the wisest grid fan or luckiest man
(it all depends on your point of
view). The procedure is simple: a
chart with the names of the guessers
and their scores and a graph show
ing which scores remain unguessed
are posted. The first man to sign up
(it costs him nothing) has his choice
of all possible scores; the second
may pick from all except the first's
choice; the third from all but those

j two, and so on.
Carr's win was unexpected as it
marked the first time during the
history of the chart that a first guess
has also been the correct one. How
ever, during the seven-year period,
only twice have guessers failed to
pick the score, thereby allowing bar-
Ixrs to reinvest the prize in sharper
j razors, fancy dandruff-remover.
Back in 1929, when Clipper Smith's
Santa Clara Broncs pulled one of
football's lasting upsets by beating
1 a strong Stanford team 13 to 6, the
( score chart also took an unexpected
beating. Larry Heiges alone of 156
guessers chose Santa Clara to win;
he did it on the last prophecy
posted; and he estimated the exact
| winning Bronco margin.
Howie Moore (former Daily
managing editor) failed as did
Carr until his final year in Law
school to choose the correct and
cash-paying score. Moore picked
Stanford to beat Santa Clara this
season, and Moore was right.
Charlie Dana set a record last year
when he picked the "winning
number" on successive Saturdays.
In addition to Carr and Moore,
winners of 1933 charts are: A1 Isaacs
(Stanford 3, U.C.L.A. 0); A1 Abram.s
(Stanford 0, Northwestern the

same); E. L. Schilling (Stanford 0,
Washington 6): and Freshman Geo.
Wingfield (Stanford 21, Olympic
Ciub 0). This year's U.S.F.-Stan
ford battle was one of the two out
:of some 60 games that have been
| missed by rabid Card grid followers.
