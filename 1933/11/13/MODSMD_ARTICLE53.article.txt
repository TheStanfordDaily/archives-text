# Four-Bit Haircut Price In Effect at Stanford
## 
### 
Rumor to the contrary notwith
standing, haircuts and shaves at
campus shops cost 50 cents and 25 '
cents, respectively.
The California Recovery Act (sub
sidiary to the NRA), stipulates that
tonsorial operations in the Golden
State shall be performed only at
above prices. A special trade area
including both Stanford and Palo
Alto was formed in which 65-cent

haircuts were allowed, but a week '
ago it was ordained that state-wide
prices must prevail here too.
Hence the four - bit clipping
charge both on the i arm and in
town.
