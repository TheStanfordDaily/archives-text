## Oxford Graduate Stars On Prison Team; Talented Musician Speaks REACH CLOSE DECISION Advertising Denounced By Stanford Team 
### Bob Ransom 
In the manner Menckenese, yes
terday afternoon saw a forensic
battle between the "ins" and "outs"
of California society. Two college
: graduates and an accomplished mu
j sician, representing San Quentin
i prison, opposed three Stanford un
dergraduates on the question: "Re-
I solved, That Modern Advertising Is
I More Detrimental than Beneficial to
j Society."
Though the judges favored the
Farm boys by a two to one deci
' sion, the joint score showed a very
i slight margin of victory.
Experience Difficulty
John McFarland, Henry Lowen
stein, and Fred Bold presented the
i affirmative argument for the In
dians, and a tough time they had of
it wilh the brilliant and experienced
San Quentin team.
Lee Chapin, popular coach, intro
duced the Stanford debaters.
John McFarland, lead off man,
condemned advertising on economic
grounds; Henry Lowenstein dis
-1 cussed the social implications, and
,Fred Bold offered a strong rebuttal
for the final speech.
Of the main speakers for the
prison, a former University of Ala
bama man cleverly turned the af
ifiimative arguments to his own ad
vantage. Particularly impressive
was the rhetoric of San Quentin's
rebuttal speakerâ€”an Oxford gradu
ate. The Card team won the deci
sion on logic, and at the same time
| received a lesson in forceful pre
sentation.
Courtesy Marked
From the 400 men that filled the
assembly hall, the visitors received
more courteous attention and intel
' ligent applause than from the usual
! debate audience.
The Stanford representatives had
I lunch with Dr. Shuder, head of the
I San Quentin educational depart
j ment, and chairman of the debate.
