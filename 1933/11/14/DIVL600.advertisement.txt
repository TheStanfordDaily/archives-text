$7.00
worth of
STYLE and COMFORT
IF you take one look at the smart
brogue lines of this shoe—then
run your hand over its leather —
you'll start weakening,
IF you slip your foot into it and
feel how snugly it clings—you'll
say "Wrap 'em up."
IF you haven't the $7.00 at the
moment we'll be glad to open an
account for you.
