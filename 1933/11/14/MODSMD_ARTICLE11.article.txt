# Deadline Set For Review
## Poems, Stories Requested For Supplement 
### 
Only six days remain before the
first deadline of the yei-unnamed
i literary supplement to the "Daily," 1
j.which is scheduled to appear De
j cember 8.
Poems, articles, and stories will
i be considered for the first issue if
J they reach the "Daily" office, or are :
' dropped in the slot of Room 204 a,
English Building, before next Mon
| day noon. If mailed, manuscripts
1 should be accompanied by postage j
: for return.
The "Daily" literary supplement,
! which considers material coming
from any source, will probably not
1 get fully under way until the spring
I quarter, since the winter months are
usually lean ones from the point of
| view of advertisers.
Several faculty members, nation
! ally-famous in their fields, and some
of the best student writers have al
j ready been engaged to write for the i
| first issue. One of the features of
jthis number will be a thorough dis
cussion of recent books on the
Brownings.
Although general space limitations
have been set, exceptionally good
| work of greater length will be con
sidered. Poetry should not exceed
30 lines; fiction and criticism above
1,000 words will not be given equal
consideration with shorter contribu
tions.
