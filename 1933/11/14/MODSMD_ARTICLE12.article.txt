# Encina Informal Bids On Sale at A.S.S.U. offices
## 
### 
Bids to the Encina informal will
be sold today for $2 at the A.S.S.U.
offices in the old Union, and by
members of the dance committee, as
the result of a final decision by the
committee after a stormy session
last night.
Dissension over the price of bids
has raged in Encina for the past
week, but no change can be made
now in the limited time remaining
before the dance, which will be held
Friday, November 17, in Encina.
Gordon Heche's orchestra, and
floral decorations and lighting by
Herb Sanderson will feature the af
fair.
