# Cats Run Wild in Back Of Union--All Varieties
## 
### JACK NEWMAN 
Cats are plentiful around ihe
Union these days. Not that this has
anything to do with the "800" but
the "Back to the Farm" instinct has
extended to animals of the feline va
riety with the result of an amazing
increase in population.
No one knows where they came
from. The janitor denies all respon
sibility for the sudden influx of cat.s
to the campus and has grave doubts
of their value even as rat catchers.
They frequent that part of the Union
grounds behind the Cellar, where
they lounge and play in true eat
like fashion.
The trend among the animals
seems to be definitely toward that
common breed "Feline Alia Cata."
Grey stripes are being worn by the
majority of Stanford cats thi.s sea
<>ii in contrast t<> the tan angora

j that was the color of the sole feline
I seen publicly last year.
Why the Union has been chosen
the settling place of this unbridled
horde, whey they come from, and
where they secure food, are a few
of the questions that confront the
i baffled Union staff. The kitchen em
ployees of the Cellar and the dining
room resent the intrustion and af
firm that they are doing everything
in their power to discourage the fe
line horde.
According to one kitchen em
ployee, all are- the scions of one
venerable she-cat. This seems hardly
probable, considering their various
i color combinations. A hint as to their
j feeding grounds may be furnished
by an occasional pair of green eyes
