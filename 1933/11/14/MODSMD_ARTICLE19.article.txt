# INDIANS REST AFTER TOUGH TROJAN GAME
## Varsity Must Take Montana In Stride, Pointing For Big Game 
### Spud Hamilton 
Sitting on top of the world after
his astounding humping of Troy,
the Stanford Injun marked time
yesterday and enjoyed an after
noon of ease. Stanford will at
tempt to take Montana, the Con
ference tag along, in stride, and
then Big Game day rolls around.
The Cardinals finished the Trojan
game with surprisingly few injuries,
which are confined mostly to bruises
and bumps. Chunky Frank Alu
stiza forgot to duck Rosenberg on
one occasion, and the result was a
neat shiner. Bob Grayson likewise
sustained a bruised beagle and a leg
injury that found him on his feet
but limping.
Maentz Still Injured
Bob Maentz, who started the game
at left half Ls not, and never has
been, in good shape since the Wash
ington downfall. With most of the
candidates for left half falling in
jured by the wayside, "Buck" Van
Dellen has a good opportunity to
jump into a starting berth for the
Big Game.
The remainder of the Cardinal
hackficld is now well established,
but Thornhill has indicated that
what might he termed the second
team will open against Montana.
It ought to include Jack Hillman,
Earl lloos. Van Dellen, and Kenny
Afflerbaugh or Chuck White at
right half.
The teaming of Bob Hamilton and
A1 Norgard left nothing to be de
sired. Norgard constantly piled up
the whole caboodle of Southern Cal
ifornia into a neat stack, while Ham
ilton flung himself v/ith terrific drive
into the ball-carrier as he broke
into the hole at the line of scrim
mage.
Return to Form "B"
It is notable that Saturday's game
marked Stanford's return to the old
Warner "B" formation, the forgot
!ten part of the Warner system since
i the last U.S.C. victory in 1927. How
i ever, it was not the system, but the
I team's hearty interest in hard hit
ting that won the game.
The Indians are in an enviable
position to clean up on California's
j Bears and make a bid for the Rose
Bowl game. Their most potent chal
i longer is Oregon's Webfeet who
have Southern California and St.
Mary's yet to conquer. Victories
over California and S.C. would off
set Stanford's blemished early sea
!son marks, and make them the un
doubted choice of the Coast for the
game.
The consensus is, "get California
and then worry about the Rose
Bowl." It looks very much like a
pair of teams enjoying indifferent
success at first, blooming forth and
finding themselves on the same day.
Stanford never during the season
was the ball team they were Satur
; day, and it looks the same for Cali
fornia, with their impressive score
; over Washington. This year's Big
Game will probably smack of the
good old days, with tickets expen
sive and elusive, and mostly behind
the goal posts.

have Southern California and St.
Mary's yet to conquer. Victories
over California and S.C. would off
set Stanford's blemished early sea
!son marks, and make them the un
doubted choice of the Coast for the
game.
The consensus is, "get California
and then worry about the Rose
Bowl." It looks very much like a
pair of teams enjoying indifferent
success at first, blooming forth and
finding themselves on the same day.
Stanford never during the season
was the ball team they were Satur
; day, and it looks the same for Cali
fornia, with their impressive score
; over Washington. This year's Big
Game will probably smack of the
good old days, with tickets expen
sive and elusive, and mostly behind
the goal posts.
Sitting on top of the world after
his astounding humping of Troy,
the Stanford Injun marked time
yesterday and enjoyed an after
noon of ease. Stanford will at
tempt to take Montana, the Con
ference tag along, in stride, and
then Big Game day rolls around.
The Cardinals finished the Trojan
game with surprisingly few injuries,
which are confined mostly to bruises
and bumps. Chunky Frank Alu
stiza forgot to duck Rosenberg on
one occasion, and the result was a
neat shiner. Bob Grayson likewise
sustained a bruised beagle and a leg
injury that found him on his feet
but limping.
Maentz Still Injured
Bob Maentz, who started the game
at left half Ls not, and never has
been, in good shape since the Wash
ington downfall. With most of the
candidates for left half falling in
jured by the wayside, "Buck" Van
Dellen has a good opportunity to
jump into a starting berth for the
Big Game.
The remainder of the Cardinal
hackficld is now well established,
but Thornhill has indicated that
what might he termed the second
team will open against Montana.
It ought to include Jack Hillman,
Earl lloos. Van Dellen, and Kenny
Afflerbaugh or Chuck White at
right half.
The teaming of Bob Hamilton and
A1 Norgard left nothing to be de
sired. Norgard constantly piled up
the whole caboodle of Southern Cal
ifornia into a neat stack, while Ham
ilton flung himself v/ith terrific drive
into the ball-carrier as he broke
into the hole at the line of scrim
mage.
Return to Form "B"
It is notable that Saturday's game
marked Stanford's return to the old
Warner "B" formation, the forgot
!ten part of the Warner system since
i the last U.S.C. victory in 1927. How
i ever, it was not the system, but the
I team's hearty interest in hard hit
ting that won the game.
The Indians are in an enviable
position to clean up on California's
j Bears and make a bid for the Rose
Bowl game. Their most potent chal
i longer is Oregon's Webfeet who
have Southern California and St.
Mary's yet to conquer. Victories
over California and S.C. would off
set Stanford's blemished early sea
!son marks, and make them the un
doubted choice of the Coast for the
