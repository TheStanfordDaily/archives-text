# Indians Swamp Troy as Gable Flees Rooters
## 
### 
Blood pressures ran high and
the thermometer spurted from
its glass tube in the sunny
south Saturday night as the
Stanford grid stars plunked the
wooden horse into its stable
until next year, and partici
pated in merry symposium,
while U.S.C. backers were left
to clear away the broken bricks
of long - standing, now - fallen
walls of Troy.
Ilappy innocent glee waxed
most exuberant at the leading
hotels where Indian rooters sat
at tables, some under tables,
danced, cheered, and made the
usual Hollywood night life look
like Aunt Dinah's quilting
party, and gave the down
trodden W. C. T. U.'s further
cause to deplore the diabolical
decadence of the much-ha
rassed younger generation.
Grid stars and rooters at the
Cocoanut Grove together
chimed in to make heart-throb,
smoothy Clark Gable a heap
big paint-and-feathers "Indian"
chief.
