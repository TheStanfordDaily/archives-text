# U.C. Lettermen Will Wear Sweaters on Wednesdays
## 
### 
"Lettermen's Day" is the newest
tradition at the University of Cali
fornia. Every Wednesday all win
ners of numerals and letters must
wear their sweaters. The reason,
says Bernie Levin, president of Blue
C, is that blue and gold sweaters
add color to the regular Wednesday
singing.
