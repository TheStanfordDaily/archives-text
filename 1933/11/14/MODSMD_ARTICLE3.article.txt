# Death Struggle
## 
### 
Death-bed convulsions of the dis
armament conference made news in
Geneva yesterday. Labor ite Hen
derson contemplated resignation as
chairman of the conference, his rea
son, "I refuse to be a party to pro
crastination."
Conference steering committee,
heroically attempting to keep the
confab from rigor mortis, listened to
a clash of opinion between Russia
and Japan over the universal appli
cation of armament control.
Italy, echoed by Hungary, again
stated Ihat the conference was sterile
without the presence of Germany.
Delegates and observers, frankly
pessimistic, awaited further pro
posals by Chancellor Hitler.
