I there are more to come, according
Mo Daily scouts who are offering big
money for players in a valiant ef
fort to ward off the defeat predicted
for the Chappie tilt.
Coach "Slip" Anfall, of the Chap
; pie team, expressed no fear of tin?
| newcomers. "Our clean, lithe
> limber American youths can beat
! paid assasins, any time, and any-
I where," he said. The Chappie team
j is still practicing in secret, however,
Jto perfect the new "twice around
and over" shift which Anfall is pre
senting to grid-lovers this year. Ac-
I cording to all indications, this play
• is the only one which the Chappies
| will use.
The "Daily" squad has never won
| this annual classic. The night editors
; have sworn not to cat or sleep until
| the victory of the "Daily" is legend.
