Armistice Dav lias come and gone, and again il was a
day of unthinking rejoicing. College students who ceJe-)
brated the anniversary of the end of the last war should
consider how near the next may he.
(iermanv, unable to meet its obligations, is planning to
spend a billion dollars on armaments.
Switzerland will spend $6,000,000, and Belgium $157,-1
000.000 to strengthen their armies.
France, which has not paid its debts pending discus-j
sions that we will not grant, supports the largest standing
army in western Kurope.
Japan, which cannot balance its budget, can spend mil
lions on her army and navy.
The tinted States, with over ten million inhabitants
destitute, can afford $2'18,000,000 for new battleships.
All this armament may not be used. But the nations
would not sacrifice so much in order to spend money on
lighting implements unless they thought there is a good
chance of a tight. The college students who will light
the next war might do better worrying about the coming
hostilities than rejoicing over the end of the last.
