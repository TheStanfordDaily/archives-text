The screen version of Ann Vick
ers, like most adaptations, sins
against the author as far as repro
[ duction of idea, but it is remarkably
[faithful to the disjointed plot. The
novel dangled several things from
a thin line of plot: argumentation
over "the job," social reform, and
the position of women. The motion
picture suffers from the episodic
material; it is connected only by the
central figure and her search for a
particular ideal, a qtiest which has
always troubled Mr. Lewis. Ann ex
presses her satisfaction in a plati
tudinous line: "escape from the
prison of ambition."
The films have been unusually
frank in their attempt to reproduce
the character of the social reformer;
neither her indiscretions of love nor
their consequences have been ex
purgated. Ann is impulsive, deter
mined, sincere; but her meaner
characteristics, which made her
fairly human, have been exorcised.
Unfortunately the director made the
Anns of 1917 and 1920 wear clothes
of a decade later, thereby suggesting
a woman strangely out of place in a
settlement-house to war ditties, or
entering upon prison reform.
Irene Dunne, too - uniformly
charming, reads her lines with grace
or wit more easily than one could
expect from Lewis' conversations.
The adapter, faithful to the text in
many speeches, eliminated the dia
tribes which are the chief concern
of Mi - . Lewis, although suggesting
some of them by contrasting shots.
Edna May Oliver has the best lines
in the supporting cast, and she de
livers them with her usual tang.
The rest of the players drift in and
out, delivering an occasional good
line, and trying desperately to cre
ate life.
The chief difficulties of the pic
ture must revert to Lewis—manipu
lated characters, attempted argu
ments, and lack of dramatic mate
rial. The injustice which causes the
author to froth is cut or minimized
so that the virtues of the novel are
merely suggested. Lewis can write
for the screen if so inclined, but his
full-grown novels are not suited to
the talking pictures. —Baker

: THE BOWERY (20th Century)
AC tiie Stanford Theatre
Yuu have to be in the mood for
this picture, but if you are feeling
gay and unrepressed and ready for
some good forthright ribaldry, you
will probably declare this the best
evening's entertainment in many a
| moon. "The Bowery" will be sus
ceptible to comparison with "She
Done Him Wrong," largely because
[ of the identity of the period treated
and the interpolated musical en
sembles. However, the only valid
point of similarity is in the utterly
I unrestrained manner of treatment of
different subjects—the bawdy ele
ment of the West picture having
given way to the rowdy of the pres
j ent opus.
As Wallace Beery remarks in the
opening sequences, "Dis is a man's
woild," and it is a woild in which
things happen rapidly on a large
j scale. The main note of the picture
jis the flamboyant rivalry between
Chuck Connors (Beery) and Steve
Brodie (George Raft,) which is man
ifest over such objects as fire-fight
| ing, gambling, a saloon, the beer
trade, Jackie Cooper, and Fay Wray.
The story is carried forward by a
series of highly interesting and oc
casionally moving incidents: Beery's
adoption of Fay Wray, young Coo
pers leaving home, the Wray-Raft
, love affair, Steve Brodie's famous
; leap from the Brooklyn bridge, the
Brodie-Connors fisticuffs, and the
ultimate and very humorous re
union between the two protagonists.
The direction is spirited, the mu
sic appropriate, the dialogue very
rapid, and the gags good and not too
old, and the three leading players
J turn in sterling performances.
Wallace Beery's Chuck is a joy to
behold: it is frank, loud, and con
sistent interpretation. George Raft
I is an exceedingly dapper Steve Bro
clie, and manages to infuse that gen
tleman with a good deal of charm
and sincerity. Jackie Cooper's work
is cut off his usual pattern, but is
| good. But if you are expecting Fay
Wray to scream, you will be disap
pointed; this is her most sedate role
in some time.
The bill also includes some ex
| cellent shots of the U.S.C. game for
I the stay-at-homes, as well as the
usual short-subject impedimenta.

The screen version of Ann Vick
ers, like most adaptations, sins
against the author as far as repro
[ duction of idea, but it is remarkably
[faithful to the disjointed plot. The
novel dangled several things from
a thin line of plot: argumentation
over "the job," social reform, and
the position of women. The motion
picture suffers from the episodic
material; it is connected only by the
central figure and her search for a
particular ideal, a qtiest which has
always troubled Mr. Lewis. Ann ex
presses her satisfaction in a plati
tudinous line: "escape from the
prison of ambition."
The films have been unusually
frank in their attempt to reproduce
the character of the social reformer;
neither her indiscretions of love nor
their consequences have been ex
purgated. Ann is impulsive, deter
mined, sincere; but her meaner
characteristics, which made her
fairly human, have been exorcised.
Unfortunately the director made the
Anns of 1917 and 1920 wear clothes
of a decade later, thereby suggesting
a woman strangely out of place in a
settlement-house to war ditties, or
entering upon prison reform.
Irene Dunne, too - uniformly
charming, reads her lines with grace
or wit more easily than one could
expect from Lewis' conversations.
The adapter, faithful to the text in
many speeches, eliminated the dia
tribes which are the chief concern
of Mi - . Lewis, although suggesting
some of them by contrasting shots.
Edna May Oliver has the best lines
in the supporting cast, and she de
livers them with her usual tang.
The rest of the players drift in and
out, delivering an occasional good
line, and trying desperately to cre
ate life.
The chief difficulties of the pic
ture must revert to Lewis—manipu
lated characters, attempted argu
ments, and lack of dramatic mate
rial. The injustice which causes the
author to froth is cut or minimized
so that the virtues of the novel are
merely suggested. Lewis can write
for the screen if so inclined, but his
full-grown novels are not suited to
the talking pictures. —Baker

: THE BOWERY (20th Century)
AC tiie Stanford Theatre
Yuu have to be in the mood for
this picture, but if you are feeling
gay and unrepressed and ready for
some good forthright ribaldry, you
will probably declare this the best
evening's entertainment in many a
| moon. "The Bowery" will be sus
ceptible to comparison with "She
Done Him Wrong," largely because
[ of the identity of the period treated
and the interpolated musical en
sembles. However, the only valid
point of similarity is in the utterly
I unrestrained manner of treatment of
different subjects—the bawdy ele
ment of the West picture having
given way to the rowdy of the pres
j ent opus.
As Wallace Beery remarks in the
opening sequences, "Dis is a man's
woild," and it is a woild in which
things happen rapidly on a large
j scale. The main note of the picture
jis the flamboyant rivalry between
Chuck Connors (Beery) and Steve
Brodie (George Raft,) which is man
ifest over such objects as fire-fight
| ing, gambling, a saloon, the beer
trade, Jackie Cooper, and Fay Wray.
The story is carried forward by a
series of highly interesting and oc
casionally moving incidents: Beery's
adoption of Fay Wray, young Coo
pers leaving home, the Wray-Raft
, love affair, Steve Brodie's famous
; leap from the Brooklyn bridge, the
Brodie-Connors fisticuffs, and the
ultimate and very humorous re
union between the two protagonists.
The direction is spirited, the mu
sic appropriate, the dialogue very
rapid, and the gags good and not too
old, and the three leading players
J turn in sterling performances.
Wallace Beery's Chuck is a joy to
behold: it is frank, loud, and con
sistent interpretation. George Raft
I is an exceedingly dapper Steve Bro
clie, and manages to infuse that gen
tleman with a good deal of charm
and sincerity. Jackie Cooper's work
is cut off his usual pattern, but is
| good. But if you are expecting Fay
Wray to scream, you will be disap
pointed; this is her most sedate role
in some time.

| ANN VICKERS (Radio)
At the Varsity Theatre
The screen version of Ann Vick
ers, like most adaptations, sins
against the author as far as repro
[ duction of idea, but it is remarkably
[faithful to the disjointed plot. The
novel dangled several things from
a thin line of plot: argumentation
over "the job," social reform, and
the position of women. The motion
picture suffers from the episodic
material; it is connected only by the
central figure and her search for a
particular ideal, a qtiest which has
always troubled Mr. Lewis. Ann ex
presses her satisfaction in a plati
tudinous line: "escape from the
prison of ambition."
The films have been unusually
frank in their attempt to reproduce
the character of the social reformer;
neither her indiscretions of love nor
their consequences have been ex
purgated. Ann is impulsive, deter
mined, sincere; but her meaner
characteristics, which made her
fairly human, have been exorcised.
Unfortunately the director made the
Anns of 1917 and 1920 wear clothes
of a decade later, thereby suggesting
a woman strangely out of place in a
settlement-house to war ditties, or
entering upon prison reform.
Irene Dunne, too - uniformly
charming, reads her lines with grace
or wit more easily than one could
expect from Lewis' conversations.
The adapter, faithful to the text in
many speeches, eliminated the dia
tribes which are the chief concern
of Mi - . Lewis, although suggesting
some of them by contrasting shots.
Edna May Oliver has the best lines
in the supporting cast, and she de
livers them with her usual tang.
The rest of the players drift in and
out, delivering an occasional good
line, and trying desperately to cre
ate life.
The chief difficulties of the pic
ture must revert to Lewis—manipu
lated characters, attempted argu
ments, and lack of dramatic mate
rial. The injustice which causes the
author to froth is cut or minimized
so that the virtues of the novel are
merely suggested. Lewis can write
for the screen if so inclined, but his
full-grown novels are not suited to
the talking pictures. —Baker

: THE BOWERY (20th Century)
AC tiie Stanford Theatre
Yuu have to be in the mood for
this picture, but if you are feeling
gay and unrepressed and ready for
some good forthright ribaldry, you
will probably declare this the best
evening's entertainment in many a
| moon. "The Bowery" will be sus
ceptible to comparison with "She
Done Him Wrong," largely because
[ of the identity of the period treated
and the interpolated musical en
sembles. However, the only valid
point of similarity is in the utterly
I unrestrained manner of treatment of
different subjects—the bawdy ele
ment of the West picture having
given way to the rowdy of the pres
j ent opus.
As Wallace Beery remarks in the
opening sequences, "Dis is a man's
woild," and it is a woild in which
things happen rapidly on a large
j scale. The main note of the picture
jis the flamboyant rivalry between
Chuck Connors (Beery) and Steve
Brodie (George Raft,) which is man
ifest over such objects as fire-fight
| ing, gambling, a saloon, the beer
trade, Jackie Cooper, and Fay Wray.
The story is carried forward by a
series of highly interesting and oc
casionally moving incidents: Beery's
adoption of Fay Wray, young Coo
pers leaving home, the Wray-Raft
, love affair, Steve Brodie's famous
; leap from the Brooklyn bridge, the
Brodie-Connors fisticuffs, and the
ultimate and very humorous re
union between the two protagonists.
The direction is spirited, the mu
sic appropriate, the dialogue very
rapid, and the gags good and not too
old, and the three leading players
J turn in sterling performances.
Wallace Beery's Chuck is a joy to
behold: it is frank, loud, and con
sistent interpretation. George Raft
I is an exceedingly dapper Steve Bro
clie, and manages to infuse that gen
tleman with a good deal of charm
and sincerity. Jackie Cooper's work
is cut off his usual pattern, but is
| good. But if you are expecting Fay
Wray to scream, you will be disap
pointed; this is her most sedate role
in some time.
The bill also includes some ex
| cellent shots of the U.S.C. game for
I the stay-at-homes, as well as the
usual short-subject impedimenta.
