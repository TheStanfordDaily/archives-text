# Uneconomic NRA
## 
### 
From Oregon comes news of a suit
filed against NRA lumber code.
Claim: Willamette Valley Lumber
Co.'s plant operations will be so re
stricted as to be "uneconomic," de
prive company of property without
"due process of law." Officials are
careful to state that lumber asso
ciation interpretations—not NRA—
are being attacked.
Irate lumber company's complaint
adds that "primary purpose of NRA
is to increase employment—not to
put people out of work." Fact is that
some 300 will be unemployed if code
is enforced. Local chamber of com
merce has advised merchants to re
move their blue eagles if protest
fails.
