Charity begins at home—and usu

The annual Red Cross drive, on
j campus and off, must pull through
in the face of unnatural depression
and natural selfishness. It must re
tell the national tale of woe; it must
combat American Antipathy to 01-

Secure and smiling down on the
Farm, Stanford students find it dif
ficult to work themselves into a
I righteous frenzy over the "deplor
able condition of the masses." When
; Union prices remain at prosperity
I highs, a national need for bread and
butter seems most improbable. The

| market; life moves along as usual.
But if we are to believe' anyone,
distress is still with us. The rugged
American is still standing on his two
feet in the breadline. Milk is still
more needed than wines and beer.
The Palo Alto Shelter must still
continue its housing of the home
less and feeding of the famine

being the rosy one, recovery bally
hooers have painted it.
Another excuse, not a reason, for
refusing Ihe Red Cross —is the no
torious record of various graft
ridden charities. That funds directed
to the simple little hovel often find
their way to the sticky gravy bowl
is sadly true. Yet the Red Cross
claims a record of administrative
cleanliness, boasts of lives saved, of
I real service rendered. The mass of
the routine work is for gratis, not
gravy.
Four hundred dollars is the quota
assigned to Stanford. A mass of
dimes and a few dollars will fill the
i bill. The traditional appeal is "one
less candy bar, one more loaf of
bread"; Stanford, having won vic
tory with the pigskin, should now
be ready to pay for the bacon.
