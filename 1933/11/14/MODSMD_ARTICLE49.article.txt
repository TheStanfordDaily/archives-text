Stanford tackling with gusto and i
apparent sheer delight in bodily !
contact. . . . Especially this hulking
figure Muller, who out-Rosyed Ro
senberg in vicious tackling. . . . And !
Bob Hamilton playing the sweetest
game of defensive halfbacking ever j
seen by this writer. . . . Jim Mos- j
crip laying out on the old dead man
play and sucking right half McNeish i
way out of his territory. . . . Which
enabled Van Dellen to go right in
that uncovered position, take a pass
and go for a 19-yard gain.
And the second pass Van Dellen j
caught and fell down with. . . . He j
didn't stumble, he was forced out'
of position making the catch. . . '. |
Clark Gable getting the jovial bird
from the Stanford rooting section. [
. . . And the rooting section was the j
most ably handled in years, thanks
to Yell Leader A1 Peache and Chair- \
man Beaubaire. . . . Peache was pas- j
sionately determined that the root- j
ers be gentlemen, and the stunts 1
were okeh, those who could see J
them tell us.
