# BABE RUTH, HOOVER ON DECK
## 
### 
Babe Ruth getting more requests
for autographs than his neighbor,
Herbert Hoover. . . . Wonder how
the Babe felt in such distinguished
company? . . . And yet he may be
the smartest of the bunch. . . . Any
way, he wrangled a million dollars
out of a game as dull as baseball.
. . . And will Howie Moore be on
our trail for that last crack! . Alu
stiza's quick kicks just clearing the
players on the scrimmage line, and
how they sailed. . . . And his first
kick would have put S C. in the hole
in the first quarter, had not the refs
found a penalty. . . .
And if Stanford had lost the game,
7-0, what a talking point the belli
gerent San Francisco sports writers
would have had. . . . Referee Louttit
giving the ball to S.C. on the Stan
ford 43-yard line for alleged illegal
clipping of Trojans going down on
the punt. . . . And the next thing,
wham! Warburton off to the wars.
. . . Just our luck, we missed the
start of Warburton's touchdown just
as we missed it at California. . . .
Not to mention Condray's run in
the S.F.U.-Stanford game.
