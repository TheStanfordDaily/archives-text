# FRANK CARIDEO ALUSTIZA PUTS BEAGLE IN

### 
Corbus likes 10 have Alustiza
holding the ball for him. . . . But
the latter was not holding on the
first two that fell short, so he butted
into things and suggested that he
might have a try at holding as long
place kicks were getting common.
. . . He did hold the last pair that
were good. . . . Ford Palmer, the
great Trojan end, was not so tough
to get out of there. . . . Hamilton's \
reverse inside Palmer worked con
stantly. . . . We would have enjoyed
seeing Moscrip's end-around tried
more often. . . . That lad is a sweet !
ball carrier. . . . But he must take
an awful beating in a game the way
he leaps in on the punter. . . . He
doesn't block any punts but he cer
tainly hurries them. . . .
Van Dellen is going to be hard to
keep out of that starting line-up
from now on. . . . This long-striding
half made some nice returns and he
got good blocking of the ends com-'
ing down. . . . Norgard did some
beautiful piling up of the interfer
ence on occasions. . . . The Stanford
uniforms looked like hell with the
shirt tails flapping in the breeze.
. . . Hope "Tiny" doesn't get super
stitious and order them as regular
duds for the boys now. . . , None

other than Ernie Nevers gave the
fight talk before the game. ... It
was a q"uiet admonition to the line
telling them the ball game was won
if they outcharged their men. . . .
