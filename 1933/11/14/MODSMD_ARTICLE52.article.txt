# CALIFORNIA LOSS CLOSES MEDIOCRE YEARLING SEASON
## 
### 
By Charles Chappcll
Handicapped from the start by
inevitable comparison with the
I 1932 freshman "wonder" team,
Coach Jimmie Bradshaw's year
ling gridders wound up a disap
j pointing but not disastrous season
last Saturday with their 10-14 loss
to California.
Although four wins and four
| losses is not a record calculated to
j warm the cockles of a coach's heart,
the freshman squad proved itself
! virtually equal to both California
and Southern California, despite
i losses to both teams
Good Yardage
Statistically and otherwise, the In
j dian frosh showed up well against
their California rivals, being finally
worn down by the superior reserve
i strength of the Bears. CoacL Brad
shaw's charges can boast a wide
margin in the matter of yards gained
from scrimmage, the count being 199
for Stanford to 138 for California.
Gaining considerably on forward
passes, the Bears brought their total
yardage from both sources up to 197
against 207 for Stanford.
The first down edge also went to
the Indians by a 9-7 count. Most
disastrous for Stanford in the way of
statistics was the fumble record,
nine being charged to the Indians
against none for the Bears. Par
tially redeeming themselves, how
ever, the Stanford frosh recovered
six of their own fumbles.
Close Gaines
Enough of statistics, however.
Suffice it to say that the Stanford
Babes gave their traditional rivals
a busy afternoon of it, continuing
the custom of close and exciting
Little Big Games.
In their earlier game with the
Trobabes, the Indian frosh came
within the proverbial hair's breadth
of snatching a well-earned 3-0 de
cision from S.C. It took a last- ,
minute pass to send them down to a
6-3 defeat, undoing the substantial
advantage they had maintained,
throughout the afternoon.
Finished Last
Though resting squarely at the.
bottom of Little Big Three stand
ings as the result of their two losses,
the Stanford Babes were pretty well
on a par with their rivals in the j
matter of potential power, which
bodes well for future varsities, the i
ultimate gÂ®al of all freshman grid
activities.
Switching over to basketball togs
in the next few days, Carl Schott,
Walt Chouteau, Dale Beedle, Paul
Spennetta, Ralph Quails, and Ray
Williamson are expected to bolster
Coach Bradshaw's casaba prospects
considerably. Williamson looms as i
a potential three-letter man, having i
quite a reputation as a javelin
thrower in addition to his prowess
on the gridiron and court.
