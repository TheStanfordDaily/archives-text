# Sleepy "Stay-at-Homes" Stage Palo Alto Rally
## 
### 
Awakened by blaring whistles
and clanging bells, sleepy-eyed
Stanfordites poured from Row and
Hall down University avenue yes
terday morning, Paly-bound, to
welcome their returning brothers,
the horde that toppled Troy.
The red - and - green Paly High
band, a goodly swarm of smiling
rooters, and two decorated hay
racks greeted battered team mem
bers and hollow-eyed travelers.
Yell Leaders Peache, Triolo, and I
Cotton, balanced on hay wagons,
led yells, introduced tired Tiny
Thorn h i 11, whose words were
drowned out by neighboring switch
engine. After applause, rooters dis
persed, followed hay racks and
bandsmen to Quad and waiting
classes.
Arranged by former Rally Chief
Ed Boyles, the caravan and recep
tion committee was estimated by
some at over 1,000. Bewildered Palo 1
Alto police declined to venture a '
guess. I
