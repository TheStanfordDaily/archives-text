After much slicing, hooking, fan
ning of balls, and missing of putts,
the women's golf ladder has finally
been formed and is posted on the
bulletin board in the Women's Gym.
Next quarter those highest on the
ladder will take part in inter-Uni
versity tournaments. Beginning the
spring quarter the eight highest will
be chosen for the all-star women's
team, and awarded WA.A. points.
