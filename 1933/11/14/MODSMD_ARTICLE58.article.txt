# Frosh Water Poloists Face Mt. View, Sequoia
## 
### 
Frosh water poloists face a hard
week, playing Mountain View on
Wednesday and Sequoia alumni on
Thursday.
The second string will star against
the Mountain View squad which has
fallen- at the hands of the first line
freshmen once before.
Thursday's game with the Sequoia
alumni will be a less easy game and
first stringers look for another tough
game with these men whom they
also defeated previously.
The boys from the Class of '37
have won seven games and have
never come close to being defeated.

Suggestions that a "code" be
adopted for college students has
been made by President James Lu
kens McConaughy of Wesleyan Uni
versity.
