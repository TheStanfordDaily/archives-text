three important aspects of the re-
I covery program: 1. Can an adminis

Elaborate Program
The speaker will point out that it
: is a very elaborate and complicated
i program which the President is put
' ting into effect and, though sympa
! thetic with the demand for some
I substantial permanent reforms in
| our economic system, he is just now
absorbed in securing recovery from
' the depression.
Professor Dowrie explained that
! some of these recovery measures are
! laying the foundation for economic
i reforms which will take a genera
| tion to complete, "in fact a dynamic
' society like ours will always be in
i the making," said Dowrie.
