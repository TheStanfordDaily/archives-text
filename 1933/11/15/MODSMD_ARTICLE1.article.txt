## Bye-Bye Parliament 
### 
Italy's Maestro Mussolini polished
o(T Capitalism, Socialism, and Italian
Parliamentary Government in one
fell speech. High points: Capitalism
lacks the i,ense of humanity. Social
ism is fragmentary, uead. The Ital
ian state is a human state (implica
tion it stays human, growing).
Launching as dictators do into for
eign policy, the number one dicta
tor denounced the League, implied
it was passe, that leadership, co-op*
eration between nations could come
only through the Mussolini-written
Four (Big) Power Pact, which would
keep the little nations in their places,
keep the big ones honest, unselfish,
unaggressive.
Turning to the home front, Mus
solini announced ho had decided to
abolish the Italian Parliament, would
delegate legislative powers to a Su
preme Economic Council and the
Fascist Grand Council. Reason: the
legislature had grown "arrogant."
Obligingly the Grand Council voted
to abolish the Parliament.
