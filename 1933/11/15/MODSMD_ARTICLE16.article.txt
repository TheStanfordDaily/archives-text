# Boos, Catcalls, Indicate Good Taste of Campus

### 
When Stanford students let loose a !
torrent of boos at a western thriller!
or award the little Nell of a heavy !
"meler-drammer" a Bronx cheer, it
is just their good taste getting the
better of their vocal cords.
"Students have better taste and
are more critical than the average
movie audience,' says the manager of
a local theatre. "When they don't
like a film, they show it."
The particular cinematic prefer
ences of Stanford students greatly
influence the type of pictures chosen !
by Palo Alto showmen.
"A good comedy is always first
choice with the campus trade,* 1 said
the manager. "Next come musical
shows like "Gold Diggers of 1933"
and "Too Much Harmony." Both of
thc»;e were among the outstanding:

] hits this quarter.
"After that," he continued, "stu
dents most appreciate sophisticated
; drama that is well done."
What Stanfordites don't like, and
what they vehemently disapprove, is
i heavy melodrama, supposedly tragic
or sentimental, that is poorly acted.
The trouble with these films seems
to be stereotyped plots in which the
audience can predict every line and
| action.
Asked about collegiate vocal pro
-1 test against pictures, the manager
• said he thought students "Got a kick
I out of booing."
The main reason for removing
vaudeville as a weekly feature from
I local theatres was the student atti
tude toward it which was embar
rassing to the performers.
