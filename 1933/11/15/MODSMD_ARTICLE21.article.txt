# Campus Thief Prowls Again
## 
### 
The Stanford prowler has taken a
great step toward becoming a cam
pus institution. Two more crimes
were. unearthed yesterday to bring
the holiday total up to four, and in
creases the total loot over a hun
dred percent.
In the Botany Building, the prow
ler took a microscope from Dr. L. R.
Blinks valued at $100. The theft re
sembles the two previous ones of
the week-end and may be attributed
to the same party, though the loot
is considerably larger.
At the Deke house a prowler not
yet identified with the other three
robberies entered the house and
managed to make away with an
overcoat and a valuable watch be
longing to Harold Anderson. This
is the second time the Dekes have
been victimized this year, the pre
vious robbery netted the invader
some $127 in cash.
The two other robberies of the
same type as the Botany department
invasion were the somewhat mo
ronic pilferings in the offices of
Dr. Gardner in Memorial Church
and the English Department secre
tary, Miss Ruth Whitehead. Only
minor articles were taken. The Bo
any robbery clearly lifts the robber
from the oettv classification.
