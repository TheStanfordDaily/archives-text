# EX COMMITTEE APPROVES BOOK EXCHANGE PLAN
## Hables, Mellinkoff Named To Look Into Details Of Economy Move 
### 
Terse, brief, and unexciting was
Ex Committee's meeting last night
around its famous mahogany table.
Slowly, one by one, members fil
tered in until a quorum was seated.
Once begun, the meeting lasted ex
actly nine and a half minutes, with
President Trautman gliding through
parliamentary procedure with arstis
tic ease.
Discuss Book Mart
Principal business discussed con
cerned the "Stanford Daily" project,
tHat of a co-operative book ex
change. Ex Committee heartily fa
vored the idea on the grounds that
it would prove a valuable saving to
students.
If carried out, this exchange would
function at the beginning of each
quarter. Students desiring to sell
books would bring them to the old
Union and students willing to pur
chase, obtain them there at a usea
textbook price.
As a means of paying several stu
dents for carrying out the sales, a
sum of 10 cents would be levied on
each transaction.
Receives Okeh
Unofficially, Ex Committee passed
the bookshelf idea. Les Hables and
Abe MellinkofT were named to look
into details, and the school admin
istration will pais upon the idea be
fore it is made an official institution.
Looking at wrist watches, mumb
ling incoherently about a sorority
jolly-up, male majority of the com
mittee approved expense money for
the Rally Committee chairman for
his southern trip, granted following
dates: Harper's Group Formal, Nov.
29; Theta Xi Formal, Nov. 29; Ger
man Honorary Society, Dec. 9; and
Graduation Club jolly-up. Nov. 23.
Election returns for frosh offices
were approved, and a move to ad
journ .resulted in hasty dashes to
the door.
