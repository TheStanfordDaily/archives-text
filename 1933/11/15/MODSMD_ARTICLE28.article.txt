"The hardest part of my job
is to discourage those who don't
possess the flair for acting. One
must have an intangible some
thing to succeed in dramatics
—more than a pretty face."
So said Harold Ilclvcnston,
dramatic instructor at the Uni
versity during an interview last
evening over radio station
K(«0.
"In acting, there is one rule,
and that is that there are no
rules. One who is not self
conscious will have a natural
appeal to the audience.
"My classes are composed of
engineers, math majors, foot
hall and javelin throwers, as
well as of English majors.
"For every play produced,
there are plenty of volunteers.
Take, for example, our recent
production, 'Arms and the
Man'. There were more than 30
tryoutees for each part."
