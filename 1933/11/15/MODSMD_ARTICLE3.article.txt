The "after prohibition what?"
game is giving great fun to all the
California big wigs. In the mean
time liquor i.s flowing more freely
than water.
The troubles: There can be no
taxes on hard liquor until the legis
lature meets. Hotel men want to
serve cocktails with meals and won't
be able to without an amendment
to the constitution.
The state authorities do not seem
worried about the gasoline and al
cohol situation, however.
