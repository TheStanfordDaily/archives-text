# Girls in Gaieties Have Chances For Careers
## 
### Frances Ayres 
The Big Game Gaieties might be
! the stepping stone to a career as
1 professional dancer for some of its
| amateur chorines, providing they are
! ambitious enough. That is the opin
j ion of Adelaide Kelly, petite Stan
ford graduate who is directing the
; chorus.
' "Quite a few of the girls," said
! she, "have the looks and ihe abil
! ity, but need training and intensive
study if they want to succeed as
professionals."
Miss Kelly, who studied dancing
I in New York and went on the load
with the Paramount-Publix Com
pany after graduation, thinks col
lege women have a future in danc
j ing if they are willing to work hard
I and offset the competition from girls
I who have spent less time in eduea

! tion, but more in specialized train-|
ling.
Asked if coeds would find stage
or vaudeville life compatible, the vi- (
vacious dance director said:
"I found that with a few excep
tions, I did not associate with llie
kind of girl I was used to in col
lege. But enjoyment of the work i
and interest in the new experience
made up for (his.
"College women are adaptable, i
and I don't think they would find
it harder to get along with their
fellow workers than i1 is in any field
of business."
Miss Kelly thinks few college
women would be content as just
chorus girls, and superior intelli
gence would help them to realize
greater ambitions,
