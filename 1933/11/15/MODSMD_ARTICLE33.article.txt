# DOWRIE LAUDS DARING ACTION OF ROOSEVELT
## Finance Professor Gives Administration Policy's Main Features DISSECTS RECOVERY Return to Gold Standard Called Probable 
### Will Williams 
I Addressing a well filled Assembly
i Hal 1 audience Stanford's soft-spoken
George W. Dowrie, professor of fi
j nance in the Graduate School of
J Business, dissected the recovery
i policies of the Roosevelt administra
tion lust night.
"In the past," Dowrie said, ''the
1 tendency has been to leave recov
jery up to dear old Mother Nature,
jl should say cruel old Mother Na
! ture."
Dowrie pointed out that both do-
I mestic and international situation .
jmake it imperative that we do not
(leave things to this slow and costly
I method.
Assist Nature
"Although an administration can
not by itself restore prosperity, it
can assist nature in doing so. The
conservatives do not approve of thin
idea, and, seeing the difficulties of
i the past few weeks are saying 'I
j told you so.' "
Roosevelt has been daring. Hoo
j ver might have been; unfortunately,
| November 1932, came along. Dowrie
j likened the situalion to that of a
man in a burning house, forccd to
jump from a second-story window.
"In thus case, he's taking the chance
of a broken leg."
i Continuing his construction of
metaphors, Dowrie went on to say
that "Congress was in possession of
some very dangerous guns to shoot
old man depression. But papa Roo
sevelt came along and took the guns
away. And he's ""keeping them."
Recovery Plans
The main features of the recovery
program, according to Dowrie, are:
1. Coaxing existing money into cir
culation. 2. Making jobs either di
rectly with the government or
through subsidizing undertakings
all over the country. 3. Bolstering
up financial institutions directly and
,by aiding other institutions whose
J investments they hold. 4. Raising
j prices to a point where a comfor
; table profit can be realized. The
| latter interests us the most, and
; Professor Dowrie dwelt at great
i length on the means of raising
j prices.
I By altering the relationship of
i supply and demand, or by the in
jection of more currency into com
petition for the supply on hand,
prices can be raised, Dowrie ex
plained.
Inflation Tried
"The President has been reluctant
Ito tamper with our monetary sys
tem, but he has tried a distinctly
| inflationary measure: buying gold at
artificially high prices in terms of
|our present dollar. Also, by cheap
ening the dollar, he invites Euro-
I pean trade. The advantage, how
j ever, is temporary, inasmuch as costs
i tend to catch up with selling price
jand foreign retaliation will be re-
I sorted to in order to protect their
! markets."
Dowrie explained that the Presi
dent has been constantly revising
his program. "Roosevelt indicated
in his speech of October 22 that he
I will keep on trying various devices
I until prices are raised and that,
| eventually, when the level reached
|is satisfactory, he will give us a
I permanently stable dollar. This
would mean a return to the gold
j standard."

Assist Nature
"Although an administration can
not by itself restore prosperity, it
can assist nature in doing so. The
conservatives do not approve of thin
idea, and, seeing the difficulties of
i the past few weeks are saying 'I
j told you so.' "
Roosevelt has been daring. Hoo
j ver might have been; unfortunately,
| November 1932, came along. Dowrie
j likened the situalion to that of a
man in a burning house, forccd to
jump from a second-story window.
"In thus case, he's taking the chance
of a broken leg."
i Continuing his construction of
metaphors, Dowrie went on to say
that "Congress was in possession of
some very dangerous guns to shoot
old man depression. But papa Roo
sevelt came along and took the guns
away. And he's ""keeping them."
Recovery Plans
The main features of the recovery
program, according to Dowrie, are:
1. Coaxing existing money into cir
culation. 2. Making jobs either di
rectly with the government or
through subsidizing undertakings
all over the country. 3. Bolstering
up financial institutions directly and
,by aiding other institutions whose
J investments they hold. 4. Raising
j prices to a point where a comfor
; table profit can be realized. The
| latter interests us the most, and
; Professor Dowrie dwelt at great
i length on the means of raising
j prices.
I By altering the relationship of
i supply and demand, or by the in
jection of more currency into com
petition for the supply on hand,
prices can be raised, Dowrie ex
plained.
Inflation Tried
"The President has been reluctant
Ito tamper with our monetary sys
tem, but he has tried a distinctly
| inflationary measure: buying gold at
artificially high prices in terms of
|our present dollar. Also, by cheap
ening the dollar, he invites Euro-
I pean trade. The advantage, how
j ever, is temporary, inasmuch as costs
i tend to catch up with selling price
jand foreign retaliation will be re-
I sorted to in order to protect their
! markets."
Dowrie explained that the Presi
dent has been constantly revising
his program. "Roosevelt indicated
in his speech of October 22 that he
I will keep on trying various devices
I until prices are raised and that,
| eventually, when the level reached
|is satisfactory, he will give us a
I permanently stable dollar. This
would mean a return to the gold
j standard."

i Hal 1 audience Stanford's soft-spoken
George W. Dowrie, professor of fi
j nance in the Graduate School of
J Business, dissected the recovery
i policies of the Roosevelt administra
tion lust night.
