# Warring Pacifists
## 
### 
The world has advanced. Without being tied down to
specifics, that statement is prohably correct. War in the
abstract is now looked upon as something horrible. Only
Hie more flamboyant of the Nazis talk about purification
bv battle, the glory of (he sword, and other absurdities.
The idea that war is a horrid thought is generally ac
cepted; and so collegians too are acquainted with that
tenet and accept it not because the idea is wrong or right
but because we accept what is accepted. College editors
echo the acceptance and pour forth a perennial wave of
palaver on the horror, brutality, insanity of war. No one
disagrees with them; everyone agrees that they are noble
people, noble indeed.
Rut then these editors, noble men all, look about them
and see the R.O.T.C. That sets them oil'. War is horrible;
that is agreed. R.O.T.C. lias something to do with war.
The cranial contact is made. The editors are off to their
typewriters. From the streets of Troy to the plains of
Minnesota, pour forth the virulent invectives against those
war-breeding horrors, the R.O.T.C. units.
The campaign jumps from an accurate major premise
(war is wrong), through a ridiculous minor premise (R.O.
T.C. breeds war), to a preposterous conclusion- R.O.T.C.
be damned.
It is true that students in an R.O.T.C. unit learn a few
fundamentals of military activity. Rut it is very difficult
to say that, because a student knows into exactly how many
small bits a shell will blow him, he is just straining to get
out and start a war so that he can prove what he has
learned.
Actually, it has the reverse effect. It is the excited
volunteer that jumps up and down with glee on the depart
ing dock. A military student who has combed and brushed
;< brace of sweating army plugs realizes in a small way
at least that war is not so many gorgeous Y.W.C.A. attend
ants with lips very red and very puckered. Of course, it
sounds a bit humorous to mention veteran and R.O.T.C.
student in the same breath; but the point that the reported
glorv of war is somewhat deflated by a little military train
ing is true none the less.
Of course, to compel military training is a justifiable
complaint. To force people Jo drill is to make bellowing
complainers out of them. It ruins the spirit of an R.O.T.C.
unit and makes hopeless drudgery out of the war. The
more intelligent military men realize thai.
That these editors want to stop war is praiseworthy.
Rut to slop war, we must blast out the causes, not the mani
festations. You can cut parsley tops forever but the foots
are still there. Jingoism, misinformation, ridiculous trea
ties let these be spiked. Rut for editors, with pens
touched, to ride full blast at parsley tops like the R.O.T.C.
goes Don Quixote one better.

The world has advanced. Without being tied down to
specifics, that statement is prohably correct. War in the
abstract is now looked upon as something horrible. Only
Hie more flamboyant of the Nazis talk about purification
bv battle, the glory of (he sword, and other absurdities.
The idea that war is a horrid thought is generally ac
cepted; and so collegians too are acquainted with that
tenet and accept it not because the idea is wrong or right
but because we accept what is accepted. College editors
echo the acceptance and pour forth a perennial wave of
palaver on the horror, brutality, insanity of war. No one
disagrees with them; everyone agrees that they are noble
people, noble indeed.
Rut then these editors, noble men all, look about them
and see the R.O.T.C. That sets them oil'. War is horrible;
that is agreed. R.O.T.C. lias something to do with war.
The cranial contact is made. The editors are off to their
typewriters. From the streets of Troy to the plains of
Minnesota, pour forth the virulent invectives against those
war-breeding horrors, the R.O.T.C. units.
The campaign jumps from an accurate major premise
(war is wrong), through a ridiculous minor premise (R.O.
T.C. breeds war), to a preposterous conclusion- R.O.T.C.
be damned.
It is true that students in an R.O.T.C. unit learn a few
fundamentals of military activity. Rut it is very difficult
to say that, because a student knows into exactly how many
small bits a shell will blow him, he is just straining to get
out and start a war so that he can prove what he has
learned.
Actually, it has the reverse effect. It is the excited
volunteer that jumps up and down with glee on the depart
ing dock. A military student who has combed and brushed
;< brace of sweating army plugs realizes in a small way
at least that war is not so many gorgeous Y.W.C.A. attend
ants with lips very red and very puckered. Of course, it
sounds a bit humorous to mention veteran and R.O.T.C.
student in the same breath; but the point that the reported
glorv of war is somewhat deflated by a little military train
ing is true none the less.
Of course, to compel military training is a justifiable
complaint. To force people Jo drill is to make bellowing
complainers out of them. It ruins the spirit of an R.O.T.C.
unit and makes hopeless drudgery out of the war. The
more intelligent military men realize thai.
That these editors want to stop war is praiseworthy.
Rut to slop war, we must blast out the causes, not the mani
festations. You can cut parsley tops forever but the foots
are still there. Jingoism, misinformation, ridiculous trea
ties let these be spiked. Rut for editors, with pens
touched, to ride full blast at parsley tops like the R.O.T.C.
goes Don Quixote one better.
