# Saturation by Degrees

Whatever else may he said for or against prohibition
repeal, it must be admitted that the administration has
manipulated very cleverly the return of drinking freedom.
The expected thing was that one day the country would
slill he bone dry, and the next day suddenly swimming in
liquor. The resulting chaos for a short while would have
given the prohibitionists ample cause for justified "I told
you so's."
However, Roosevelt and his aides are wise enough to
let the public gradually get used to drinking openly. Ha til
er than let the gates down overnight, the process has been
to let the liquor trickle in slowly, increasing the volume
step bv step as the weeks go by.
First there was beer, then legalized wine, then one
drink of "tonic" to a person, then unlimited amounts of
litis medicine to each restaurant patron who declared he
was sick, then drugstore sale of whiskey without prescrip
tions. then grocery store and department store sale of whis
key, and now finally open, advertised sale of every kind
of liquor in any hotel, restaurant, or barroom.
On December there will be nothing left to celebrate
except the technical legalization of something already ex
istent.
