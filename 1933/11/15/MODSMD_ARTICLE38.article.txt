TRISTAN AND ISOLDE (Wagner)
, W»r Memorial Opera Hr.use
Wagner's fervid, exultant music
i for his greatest masterpiece brought
jrforth the most brilliant performance
: thus far of the opera season. The
' splendid singing of the experienced
cast and the sensitivity of the or
chestra under the persuasive au
thority of delighted Alfred Hertz
wove together a thrilling interpre
, tation of the score.
In "Tristan" Wagner united most
I successfully his theory of music and
| drama, but at the same time proved
himself a greater composer than
a dramatist. For it is the throbbing
i ecstasy of his music which gives
! spiritual integrity to the passion of
I the tragic lovers and not the fragile
j libretto or its customarily silly act
j ing. This glorious elevation of emo-
I tion is what makes the love duet and
i the final arias experiences far sur
-1 passing the merely titillating sensa
tionalism of most grand opera.
The evening was an impressive
debut for Gertrude Kappel. Her
voice had rich color, roundness, and
clarity, particularly in the poignant
high notes and only less so in the
lower phrases. Isolde's first act nar
rative, she gave fine feeling, and
brought delicate, sweeping exalta
tion to the Liebestod finale, where
unfortunately Hertz's excitement al
lowed the orchestra to thunder her
: down too much. Her characteriza
! tion was graceful although self-
I consciously statuesque.
- Paul Althouse made an intense—
-if rather undignified—Tristan. His
; tenor was strong and capable, and
!he gave emphatic conviction to the
; surging climaxes of the last act.
! But, like most Wagnerian tenors, his
I tones often have a thick looseness in
I legato measures.
Kathryn Meisle's powerful con
-1 tralto almost outdistanced the other
| singers with its volume and solidity,
| and her Brangane had less of the
extravagant harshness which marred
her Amneris.
Pinza tempered the full strength
of his magnificent bass to proper
j tragic dignity. Bonelli's impetuous
| Kurvenal was effectively dramatic
:in the third act, and his firm vi
brancy of tone expressed tender
j compassion to the dying Tristan. The
I piher singers, notably Gandolii, were
; uniformly excellent.

1 The orchestra deserves much
credit for its'capable, but somewhat
too noisy, rendition of the diificult
score. And Agnini's traditional set
tings were beautifully designed and
painted. —Broughton
FLUSH: A Biography. By Virginia
Woolf. llarcourt, Brace & Co.
193:5. $2.
Flush, that most famous pet of
: literary history, not content with
Katharine Cornell's efforts, has re
ceived yet further ,posthumous cele
! bration.
This time it is at the hands of that
perfect stylist, Virginia Woolf, whose
sly humor and civilized sentimental
ity weave a delightful and unusual
biography. The delicate overtone
texture of her writing is here more
, direct than in the metaphysical
l beauties of "The Waves" and the fu
gitive abstraction of "To the Light
house." Here there is still her pe
' culiar radiance, but it is no longer
elusive; life is touched directly, with
i rich and witty feeling in that touch.
It is Virginia Woolf on a holiday.
Mrs. Woolf lives through Flush's
life with him in retrospective imagi
| nation, and she is able to keep pace
with him because her canine psy
chology is accurate and unrestrained.
It would be 'simple to quote from
1 any of the incidents of the book—
Flush's first meeting with Miss Bar
rett, his kidnapping, his gay love af
fairs in Italy—but each is so excel
lent in itself that quotation would
be endiess, as is the case with any
Virginia Woolf book. The remark
able fact is that the scanty anec
dotes are spun into an always lively,
poetic and tender recreation of the
I lower aristocracy of a famous Vir
torian household.
Mrs. Woolf does not forget Eliza
beth Barrett. She is etched in
touchingly and amusingly, although
we are forced to believe that she
never understood Flush as well as
Mrs. Woolf does. She never real
ized what a languid little Victorian
' snob he was. Truly Miss Barrett's
poem, "To Flush, My Dog," does
not bear rereading after this biog
| raphy. It almost makes Flush the
pet of Mrs. Woolf, and Mrs. Brown
ing only a gushing stranger. But
doubtless it is just as 'well that peo
ple do not reread Mrs. Browning
I these days anyway. —Broughton
