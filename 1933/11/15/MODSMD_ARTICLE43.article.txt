# Purify Huey?
## 
### 
Cat calls, boos, bronx cheers and ;
near riots wore the features of the
Senate investigation of the Long po- {
litical machine in New Orleans yes
terday. Edwin Rightor, instigator of
the investigation, and the audience
both seemed to think that the in
i vestigation was being run crook -
jedly. Said Rightor: "This investiga-"
tion has degenerated into an effort
, to purify Huey Long and whitewash
this investigation."
