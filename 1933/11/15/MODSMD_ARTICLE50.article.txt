Despite all the mouth flapping
about the greatest team East of the
Mississippi, and the team which
ought to play the Rose Bowl game,
even a careless scrutiny of the sit
uation will reveal only one outstand
ing club, Michigan.
The Wolverines have gone un
defeated, we believe, for three years,
and under tlie leadership of youth
ful Harry Kipke have won or tied
for the Big Ten Conference during
that time. They should have been
asked last year, when they won the
national championship under the
Dickenson ratings, and if they clear
their last two scheduled games with
a good record, it will be nothing 1
short of a crime to deprive the West
of any opportunity of watching "the
punt, prayer, and pass" team.
Harry Kipke, who not so !
long back was hitting them on the
pick for Michigan himself, is right
pi'oud of his defense. He is not brag
ging, you must understand, but he (
would just like to see the team that '
could make yards over his guards, i
His ends and tackles, Kipke allows, i
are just the worst kind of poison
to rival off-tackle plays. It's simple, j
the Kipke system — the ends wait J
when the tackles charge or the j
tackles charge and the ends wait, ;
and there you have defense in a nut
shell.
Kipke has a few other things be- i
side his system. Last year he had j
Bill Newman, this year it's Bill Ren- ;
nerk, not to mention Bernard, the
demon on defense center, and others i
"too numerous to mention."
