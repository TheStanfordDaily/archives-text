# ROSE BOWL WAS BOWL OF CHERRIES, FOR S.C.
## 
### 
Last season U.S.C. and Michigan i
were the logical teams to play the
Rose Bowl game, with the nation's j
most potent running* attack pitted
against a great defensive team that
punted and waited for the breaks. >
This year whoever plays for the j
West, Michigan should get a bid, |
even if they do not successfully clear
Northwestern and Minnesota.
Army has been favorably men- ]
tinned., but Army has played no se- 1
l'ious schedule. Illinois was their
only Class A opponent, and Illinois ]
fell 6-0. Georgia in the South has a
nice looking record but their oppo- !
nents have been none too impres
sive, and as for Princetonâ€”a beauti- j
ful string of victories but not an
eligible schedule.
Princeton though, has some points j
in its favor. It would be an espe- |
cially good match for Stanford, in j
the event the Cards got lucky and I
received the Pasadena invitation, j
The Tiger, in common with the In- I
dian, has a great team of sophomores j
this season, and thoy have broken
wild all over a bunch of mediocre |
teams. Their closest games were |
won by one touchdown, over Wash- i
ington and Lee, and Dartmouth, who !
are not quite the real McCoy.
We have one suggestion, though.
However this present year turns out
for Stanford and Princeton, win, '
lose, or draw, it might be well to j
consider the possibilities of the game
for the Rose Bowl in 1935, when the
two sets of sophomores will be jun
iors, still ambitious and not yet sur- '
feited with the glories of the game.
