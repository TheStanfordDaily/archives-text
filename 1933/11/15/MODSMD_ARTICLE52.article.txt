At George Washington University
ihe four star backs suffered broken '
schnozzles, and they all wore masks
. . . which would have made a swell ;
picture for the Sunday rotogravures [
alongside the bathing beauties. . . .
Their nine touchdowns scored in five
games by Purdue averaged 41 yards
to the run. . . . Paul Johnson of
Army, and Irv Warburton of South
ern California are the .sport writers'
choices for the smartest signal cal- i
lers, . . . Gonzaga University has not
won a game this year.- . . . Stanford
has won and lost all their Confer
ence games this year through the '
medium of field goais, three by our
Bill Corbus . . . and two by Wash
ington's Bill Smith. . . . The once
king of football, Notre Dame, has
won only one game this year . . .
and scored only 12 points.
