# SOCCERMEN MEET S.F.U. IN CRUCIAL CONFERENCE TILT
## Chances for Championship At Slake; Dons Have One Game Lead 
### 
With the odds and the league
leading S.F.U. Dons piled up
against them, a desperately fight
ing Stanford soccer eleven is
either to be made or broken in
this afternoon's crucial Confer
ence tangle. A 2 to 1 defeat by
the Dons earlier in the season
makes it imperative that the In
dian soccerites boom from 3:30 un
til the final whistle shrills out this
| afternoon in order to have a
chance for the Conference cham
pionship.
It is in order to avoid the haz
ards and uncertainties of nocturnal
scrimmaging that the contest begins
at 3:30 o'clock or sooner. If the play
extends into darkness, as it is likely
ito do with the long hour and a half
jof soccer battling, the Reel team is
apt to be weakened by the loss of
two valuable men, goalie Jack King
\ and right halfback Rudy Gonzales,
on account of eyesight difficulty.

The Indians' only chance to win
will come from clicking right at the
start. If they can play as well as
they did in the California games
last quarter, when they outplayed
the powerful Bear team after three
quarters of defensive battle to win
by 1 to 0, the offensive scoring line
will keep the ball flying into the
goalzone. That is what will matter
principally as the Stanford varsity's
forward wall is somewhat weakened
by the inexperience of the recent ly
changed Doug Kennedy, right in. ide.
Offense Strong
But with such good shooters and
runners as Captain Carl Knecht,
Mike Gomez, Art Hearn, and Sven
Doddington in the forward to star
in their own field.s and to help Ken
nedy, the offensive should swish the
ball into S.F.U.'s goalnet several
times. They will if they get under
way.
Halfbacks and fullbacks will be
strong enough to sadly harrass even
the justly celebrated Dons' offen
sive. Johnnie Moore, center half
back, Waddy White, left half, and
Gonzales, right half, will be started
in the midfield positions. With Cy
Johnson and Dick Strouse, left and
right fullbacks, respectively, backed
by King in the goalmouth, Stan
ford's defense will be very strong.
Whether or not they'll be able to
stand up against the Dons, who have
for two seasons been able to score
through Cardinal defenses, will be
the acid test of their organization.
It was a different line-up which
laced the San Francisco ' players
early in the season.
Dons Undefeated
Since defeating Stanford the Dons
have beaten every Conference team
they have opposed, with the excep
tion of a tie with California this
last Saturday. Although compari
sons are invalid, the only promising
dope comes from this recent infor
mation. With beating Cal last Wed
nesday, and with Cal holding S.F.U.
last Saturday, a small chance can
be figured for the Slanfordites.

tion of a tie with California this
last Saturday. Although compari
sons are invalid, the only promising
dope comes from this recent infor
mation. With beating Cal last Wed
nesday, and with Cal holding S.F.U.
last Saturday, a small chance can
be figured for the Slanfordites.
With the odds and the league
leading S.F.U. Dons piled up
against them, a desperately fight
ing Stanford soccer eleven is
either to be made or broken in
this afternoon's crucial Confer
ence tangle. A 2 to 1 defeat by
the Dons earlier in the season
makes it imperative that the In
dian soccerites boom from 3:30 un
til the final whistle shrills out this
| afternoon in order to have a
chance for the Conference cham
pionship.
It is in order to avoid the haz
ards and uncertainties of nocturnal
scrimmaging that the contest begins
at 3:30 o'clock or sooner. If the play
extends into darkness, as it is likely
ito do with the long hour and a half
jof soccer battling, the Reel team is
apt to be weakened by the loss of
two valuable men, goalie Jack King
\ and right halfback Rudy Gonzales,
on account of eyesight difficulty.

The Indians' only chance to win
will come from clicking right at the
start. If they can play as well as
they did in the California games
last quarter, when they outplayed
the powerful Bear team after three
quarters of defensive battle to win
by 1 to 0, the offensive scoring line
will keep the ball flying into the
goalzone. That is what will matter
principally as the Stanford varsity's
forward wall is somewhat weakened
by the inexperience of the recent ly
changed Doug Kennedy, right in. ide.
Offense Strong
But with such good shooters and
runners as Captain Carl Knecht,
Mike Gomez, Art Hearn, and Sven
Doddington in the forward to star
in their own field.s and to help Ken
nedy, the offensive should swish the
ball into S.F.U.'s goalnet several
times. They will if they get under
way.
Halfbacks and fullbacks will be
strong enough to sadly harrass even
the justly celebrated Dons' offen
sive. Johnnie Moore, center half
back, Waddy White, left half, and
Gonzales, right half, will be started
in the midfield positions. With Cy
Johnson and Dick Strouse, left and
right fullbacks, respectively, backed
by King in the goalmouth, Stan
ford's defense will be very strong.
Whether or not they'll be able to
stand up against the Dons, who have
for two seasons been able to score
through Cardinal defenses, will be
the acid test of their organization.
It was a different line-up which
laced the San Francisco ' players
early in the season.
Dons Undefeated

have beaten every Conference team
they have opposed, with the excep
tion of a tie with California this
last Saturday. Although compari
