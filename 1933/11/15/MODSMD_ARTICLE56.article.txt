## 
### 
Regulation red and white rooters'
caps will be in order at Saturday's
Montana game, say Rally commit
tee members. The rooting section
will be formed, beginning at the
top of the grandstand, so . choice
seats will go to early arrivals.
The band will be at the game, also
Rally committeemen and yell lead
ers. Stanford songs and yells will
be used as a final practice for Big
Game stunts.
