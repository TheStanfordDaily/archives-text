# THORNHILL GROOMS TEAM FOR CALIFORNIA CONTEST
## 
### 
The football team that beat U.S.C.
tame back to cold realities yester
day and began to prepare for the
' hunting of the Golden Bear. Just
! as if they had never heard of the
Trojan downfall, Stanford's men
were back ( in their own back yard,
| throwing passes all over the place,
and running dummy scrimmage.
No Scrimmage
Coach "Tiny" Thornhill declared
that there would be no actual scrim
mage this week, which means there
will probably be none the rest of
the season. In dummy scrimmage
against a retreating defensive line,
Thornhill believes he obtains all the
experience that heavy workout
gives, without the incidental threat
of injuries.
Last night found Bobby Grayson
! legging it around the field, but not
in uniform. The rest of the team is
; in good shape, barring Frank Alu
; stiza's blackened optic. Ben Pala
! mountain was really cutting loose
for the first time in weeks. He will
i probably be in good condition for
j the Cal game, albeit he will have
hard slugging to push gentlemen
Bob Reynolds and Jack Drown out
I of his way.
Reisncr Shines
Johnny Reisner was booting some
| long punts that rivaled Alustiza's
for distance, and bettered them for
height.
Thornhill gave long attention to a
backfield which consisted of Bill
Sim, Chuck White, Jack Hillman,
and Alustiza. This may be favored

to start the Montana game, with
chances that all men will see service
before the final gun.
Thornhill Ueininisces
Coach Thornhill disclosed yester
day that last Friday was not the
fi:;>t sleepless night he had spent be
lore a lootball game. Way back in
1916, when he was playing a whale
ol a tackle for Pittsburgh along side
Jock Sutherland, present Pitt coach,
the Panthers traveled to Annapolis
to play Navy.
The train was wrecked at York,
Pennsylvania, and delayed several
hours. The team had no chance to
sleep and didn't get inlo Annapolis
until half an hour before game time.
With no food and no sleep they
started to play.
Pittsburgh Shaken
Pittsburgh was the class of the
East that year, but so shaken were
they, that Navy, starring a young
fella named Bill Ingram, got away
for three touchdowns in the first
three quarters. Then Thornhill and
his team-mates took a hitch in their
belts, broke three men loose on long
runs and won the game, 20-19.

fi:;>t sleepless night he had spent be
lore a lootball game. Way back in
1916, when he was playing a whale
ol a tackle for Pittsburgh along side
Jock Sutherland, present Pitt coach,
the Panthers traveled to Annapolis
to play Navy.
The train was wrecked at York,
Pennsylvania, and delayed several
hours. The team had no chance to
sleep and didn't get inlo Annapolis
until half an hour before game time.
With no food and no sleep they
started to play.
Pittsburgh Shaken
Pittsburgh was the class of the
East that year, but so shaken were
they, that Navy, starring a young
fella named Bill Ingram, got away
for three touchdowns in the first
three quarters. Then Thornhill and
his team-mates took a hitch in their
belts, broke three men loose on long
runs and won the game, 20-19.
The football team that beat U.S.C.
tame back to cold realities yester
day and began to prepare for the
' hunting of the Golden Bear. Just
! as if they had never heard of the
Trojan downfall, Stanford's men
were back ( in their own back yard,
| throwing passes all over the place,
and running dummy scrimmage.
No Scrimmage
Coach "Tiny" Thornhill declared
that there would be no actual scrim
mage this week, which means there
will probably be none the rest of
the season. In dummy scrimmage
against a retreating defensive line,
Thornhill believes he obtains all the
experience that heavy workout
gives, without the incidental threat
of injuries.
Last night found Bobby Grayson
! legging it around the field, but not
in uniform. The rest of the team is
; in good shape, barring Frank Alu
; stiza's blackened optic. Ben Pala
! mountain was really cutting loose
for the first time in weeks. He will
i probably be in good condition for
j the Cal game, albeit he will have
hard slugging to push gentlemen
Bob Reynolds and Jack Drown out
I of his way.
Reisncr Shines
Johnny Reisner was booting some
| long punts that rivaled Alustiza's
for distance, and bettered them for
height.
Thornhill gave long attention to a
backfield which consisted of Bill
Sim, Chuck White, Jack Hillman,
and Alustiza. This may be favored

to start the Montana game, with
chances that all men will see service
before the final gun.
