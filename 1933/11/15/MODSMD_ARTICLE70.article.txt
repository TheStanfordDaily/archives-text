Facing the world today, Ray Ly- |
man Wilbur, President of Stanford I
University and former Secretary of
the Interior, said, according to an
Associated Press dispatch, is "to
learn how to manage ourselvesâ€”to -
control our own lives."
Addressing the student body of
the California Institute of Tech
nology, the distinguished educator!
remarked that "history has shown
that civilizations founded like yours,
where the water you drink doesn't
come in the form of rain, tend to be J
the most fragile.
"Thus, we teachers in this part of j
the world must work for a perma
nent civilization that may be at
tained only through reasonably
harmonious understanding with each'

other and with other peoples. We
must encourage improved methods
of passing information about and
acting upon it."
Saying that "we must play sci
ence's game and we can't expect to
make the rules of the game for sci
ence," he illustrated by adding that
"a typhoid baccilus cannot be ex
pected to have any religion."
"The Jews are great because they
developed a code of living," he said.
"They didn't experiment in the con
scious manner by which modern sci
ence- advances but they learned
enough experience to forge ahead.
Our present economic plans are not
founded on scientific experiments
but are merely the result of trial
and error, or 'hit or miss'."
