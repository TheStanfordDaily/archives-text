The death of Bub Pelouse in a
plane crash Friday which detracted
so largely from Dink Templelon's
l enjoyment of Stanford's victory over

"great exaggeration."
While Templeton wrote moving
i words of elegy in hi.s sports column,
Pelouse lay, not in the morgue, but
in a Portland hospital. He was suf
fering from a fractured knee-cap
which he sustained in the plane ac
| cident which was reported to have
caused his death.
Pelouse, a former Stanford ath
lete, was instrumental,in interesting
Bob Grayson in coming to Stanford
University. He was enroute to see
his friend play against S.C. when
the plane in which he was traveling
crashed, killing four persons and in
juring five. His condition is not se
rious and he should be in a condi
! tion to leave the hospital in two
weeks, according to information re
