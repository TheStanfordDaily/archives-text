# CYNICAL DEBATE TEAMS TANGLE ON MILITARISM
## Forum Speaker to Have Taste of Official Combat STANFORD VERSUS U.C. Audience May Take Part In Floor Argument 
### Charles Chappell 
"My country, right or wrong!"
oft-quoted utterance of the heroic
Stephen Decatur, once upheld, now
I frequently challenged, will meet the
searching test of cynical collegiate
intellectuals tomorrow night when
debaters of Stanford and California
clash in the Little Theatre.
Forum Speakers Talk
Under the joint auspices of the
Debate Council and the newly
formed Stanford Forum, speakers of
I the two universities will discuss the
merits of the question, Resolved:
That University Students of America
Should Pledge Themselves not to
Participate in Future Wars.
Upholding the side long-cham
pioned by the American Legion, the
D.A.R., and other highly-articulate
patriotic organizations, David Mel
linkoff, Forest Mills, and James Mi
nor will present the negative case
for Stanford. The California visitors
will uphold the affirmative view,
1 agreeing with the idealistic princi
ples of the Socialist party and other
apostles of a non-military order.
Novel Plan
Novel and interest-stimulating is
the plan proposed for tomorrow
night's forensic tilt. Combining the
plan of the Stanford Forum and the
more traditional debating proce
dure, the audience will be given a
chance to take part in the evening's
verbal pyrotechnics.
Each of the six formal speakers
will be allowed only five minutes to
present his argument, with any
; member of the audience being priv
ileged to interrupt at any time with
: a question. Dropping the ordinary
rebuttal procedure, each team will
j have one member present a sum
mary of its opening arguments.
Floor to Talk
After the two summaries, the floor
will be thrown open to one and all
by Chairman Frank Fullen wider.
Speakers from the floor, like the de
baters, will be allowed but five min
utes each. After speeches, summa
ries, and general discussion of the
; question will be voted on by the au
dience. The vote will be taken, not
' on the argument put up by the op
posing teams, but on the audience's
individually-conceived opinions.
Besides being the first joint effort
of the Debate Council and the Stan
ford Forum, the discussion will mark
the last and most important campus
appearance of the Indian debaters
this year.

Novel and interest-stimulating is
the plan proposed for tomorrow
night's forensic tilt. Combining the
plan of the Stanford Forum and the
more traditional debating proce
dure, the audience will be given a
chance to take part in the evening's
verbal pyrotechnics.
Each of the six formal speakers
will be allowed only five minutes to
present his argument, with any
; member of the audience being priv
ileged to interrupt at any time with
: a question. Dropping the ordinary
rebuttal procedure, each team will
j have one member present a sum
mary of its opening arguments.
Floor to Talk
After the two summaries, the floor
will be thrown open to one and all
by Chairman Frank Fullen wider.
Speakers from the floor, like the de
baters, will be allowed but five min
utes each. After speeches, summa
ries, and general discussion of the
; question will be voted on by the au
dience. The vote will be taken, not
' on the argument put up by the op
posing teams, but on the audience's
individually-conceived opinions.
Besides being the first joint effort
of the Debate Council and the Stan
ford Forum, the discussion will mark
the last and most important campus
appearance of the Indian debaters
this year.
