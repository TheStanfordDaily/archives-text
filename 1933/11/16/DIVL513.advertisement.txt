A bird's -eye view
showed the way
Telephone engineers recently found the best
route for ;i new telephone line by taking a bird's
eye view of their difficulties.
The territory was heavily wooded, spotted
with swamps and peat beds, with roads far apart.
So a map was made by aerial photography. With
this map, the best route was readily plotted, field
work was facilitated.
Bell System ingenuity continues to extend the
telephone's reach —to speed up service —to make
it more convenient, more valuable to you.
