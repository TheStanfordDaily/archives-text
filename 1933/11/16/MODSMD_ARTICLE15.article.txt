looked around, got interested opin
ions on tonight's Forum-Debate
Council sponsored Public Fracas on
the question "Resolved, that stu
dents should pledge themselves not
to participate in future wars." Said
a local fire-eater:
"Any man who wouldn't fight for
the United States, especially in a
defensive war, is a son-of-a-gun,
entitled to neither respect nor honor.
These colleges pacifists who say they
won't fight to protect their country
will change their minds when a war
comes or have their minds changed
for them.
"In my home town during the
World War a group of professional
soldiers heard that a certain man
was against the war. They took him
down the main street and at each
corner of every intersection they
made him kneel and kiss the Ameri
can Flag while hundreds jeered."
Said Commander Bryant, local
internationally-minded naval offi
cer: "It would be far better if stu
dents would devote their efforts to
a timely prevention of war rather
than to a policy of doing nothing
until it is too late: that in the event
of war such a student movement
would confront the government with
internal as well as external enemies
and would bring about a situation
beyond the student's control."
Mrs. F. C. Schofield of the Palo
Alto "Caspar de Portola" Chapter
of D.A.R. contained her comment;
said only "I do not favor war, the
more aggressive of our members
stand for military preparedness. I
hope to attend the meeting."
Stanford's Dean Hoover, colonel
in the U.S. Reserves, and Colonel
Cubbison, R.O.T.C. head, wary, stra
tegic, refused comment.
