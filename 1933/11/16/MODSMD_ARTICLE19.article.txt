# Verbal War Guns Fired at Tonight's Forum Discussion
## Militarism in Spotlight As California, Stanford Debaters Clash 
### 
Many are the quiet nights that
students, profs, and Paly people
spend listening or snoozing in the
restful, if archaic, atmosphere of
Stanford's time-worn Little Theatre.
Tonight at 8 o'clock comes some
thing different, more eventful. Stu
dent Forum, Campus Discussion, and
Gripe group, sponsors a debate
where the speakers will not orate
for points, but, of all things, attempt
to convince their auditors.
The questions, wordy, weighty, all
too possible to cause Stanford men
gray hairs a little later on, is "Re
solved, that university students
should pledge not io participate in
future wars."
Cal Smoothies
Cal debaters, smooth - tongued,
able, will attempt the affirmative,
Stanford's loyal, nationalist sons,
Mills, Mellinkoff, and Minor, will
ring out the bells with "my coun
try right or wrong," that old gag of
Steve Decatur's. Decatur will be
remembered for good work in the
war of 1812.
Forum rules are the order of the
night. That means ANY PERSON
IN THE AUDIENCE may question
a speaker at any time, even in the
middle of a sentence; that any per
son on the floor may take up the
discussion when the men on the
platform left off, may have five min
utes of the valuable time to put
forward their view, attempt to bring
the audience to their way of think
ing.
Five Minule Talks
Debaters on the platform, Cal and
Stanford alike, will be held, so
promises Forum's chairman for the
night, Frank Fullcnwider, to five
minutes speaking time, no more, no
less. There will be no trifling with
rebuttals, points, but the last speaker
for each side will sum up as sharply,
briefly, pungently what his team
mates have put forward.
Fullenwider caught in a comprom
ising attitude on ihe Law steps late
yesterday said he feared fireworks;
that the local D.A.R. and American
Legion who often hound radical stu
dents, castigating them and Stan
ford's name, up and down the state,
would be on Forum's and debaters'
heels, and on the floor making loud
patriotic noises, interrupting pacifist
speakers, championing the war
wager's cause.
"At any rate," said Lee Chapin,
Forum's rules of fair and free speech
will be in force"; thai cardinal prin
ciple one—discussion shall continue
for no more than an hour and a
he'lf—would be enforced. This means,
we take it, the talk-torn audience
will vote on the question at 9:45
o'clock, and having decided whether,
in a future case, it favors billets
back of bars or billet with bullets,
it will retire to that well-known
cup of Union coffee, and to lock
outs and -ins.
