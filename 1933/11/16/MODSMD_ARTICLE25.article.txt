# Chappie Will Feature Football "Low-Down"
## 
### 
Traced to his clipping-plastered
room in the Press Building, the Old
Boy was found today drawing with
blue pencil on a large sheet of paper.
He admitted, on close questioning,
that it was to be Coach Tiny Thorn
hill himself, one of the chief deco
rations and objects of dedication in
next week's Stanford Axe edition
of the Chappie.
As an aid to spectators in imagin
ing what the players on the field
far below them at the Big Game
really look like, Oliver Johnston has
contributed unmistakable likenesses
of certain of the most famous of the
men. Other artistic and literary con
tributions will prove informative
also, on matters pertaining to the
Axe and the Big Game.
