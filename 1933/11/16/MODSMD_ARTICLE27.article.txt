# Allen Plays Spain Songs
## Romantic Music Features Chapel Program 
### 
Spain and the music that comes
from that romantic country will be
featured by Warren D. Allen in his
recital today at 4:15 o'clock in the
Memorial Chapel. The whole pro
gram is by Spanish composers.
"Fantasia" was composed by Jose
Maria Beobide, who is the organist
at Burgos Cathedral. From the six
teenth centuryâ€”"the Golden Age"
in Spain, to the present day, Spain
has boasted a long line of distin
guished organists only too little
known in this country.
The "Fisherman's Song" and
"Pantomine" from "El Amor Bru
jo," by Manuel de Falla, have been
transcribed from the orchestral score
by Maurice Besly.
"Communion" is by the chapel
master of Seville Cathedral, Edu
ardo Torres.
Eugene Gigout's Spanish Rhapsody
is based upon the Catalonian airs
and is dedicated to the city of Bar
celona.
"Diferencias (Variations) sobre el
Canto de Caballero," by Antonio de
Cabezon, will also be played.
Mr. Allen will repeat this same
program on Sunday, November 19,
at 4 o'clock.
