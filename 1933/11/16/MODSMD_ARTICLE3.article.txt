# Ruffled Blue Eagle
## 
### 
A tired and battle-worn NRA
trouper returned iiom a stormy
mid-western swing yesterday. Trou
bled General Johnson announced
that observance of codes and blue
eagle agreements was bad, needed
more watching, even more enforce
ment. Hoped-for solution; public
hearings on consumer complaints of
profiteering.
There is now no doubt but what
F.R.'s blue eagle is now a much
maligned bird, its tail feathers badly
ruffled by recent mid-western en
gagements. Besides, eager, gravy
seeking states are still waiting for
money to start ; public work, blame
Secretary, Ickes for the delay. Said
petulant, irked Senator Dill: "Hell
will pop when Congress convenes.
Roosevelt will lose Congress." G.O.P.
elephant is rumored scenting possi
ble spoils.
