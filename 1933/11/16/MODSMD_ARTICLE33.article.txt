# Sell-Out Seen for Big Game Gaieties Tickets
## 
### 
Although seats lor the Gaieties
do not go on sale until Monday on
the Engineering corner, the largest
number of requests for reservations
of dollar seats in Dramatic Council
history has been placed with Man
ager Ben Cave. Declining to boast
of a sell-out already, Cave does not
look exactly depressed over the good
news.
Lowest price for first class tickets
in Gaieties ever ollered, the dollar
seats are getting the big rush at
present, indicating a large amount
of money ready to flow Gaietie.s
ward for 75 and 50-cent tickets
later.
