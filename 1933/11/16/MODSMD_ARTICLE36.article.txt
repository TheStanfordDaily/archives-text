# Constructive—Of Course
## 
### 
Word has come lo our tingling cars that some people
have chastized the Daily, not lor any particular sin; hut
for sinning in general. The general sinning is our reputed
destructive attitude. We would do nothing about this nasty
hit of gossip except that the people who indulge in it take
such keen inner joy in pinning the destructive label on the
Daily. They swell within them at classifying themselves
constructive, classifying the Daily as destructive.
They assume that newspapers like cement mixers must
he constructive. They forget that only bv clearing away
the rot, can the beautiful be constructed. They forget that
there seems little point to singing hosannas when the air
recks with them. They forget that every criticism almost
automatically points a better path.
Hut the Daily does agree with many things, and today
would like lo praise them.
* * *
Wc think that the Men's Council is a splendid body;
performs without favor to all alike.
We look with favor on mothers not only because they
are a hoy's best friend, but because they are mothers.
We approve generally of the "800" because they obviate
running to Mills; and we disagree with running except in
track meets.
Students government is fundamentally more desirable
liiiui faculty control.
The I'nion is to be complimented on offering a cup of
coH'ee for five cents; also on their wisdom in culling the
price from ten cents and thus forever ending a perennial
editorial subject.
The Library is excellent because it has many books in
it; an«l books arc fine.
The Post Office is to be congratulated and in the same
breath encouraged because postal systems facilitate the
communication of letters and postcards; also small pack
ages.
The Administration is to be complimented for having
roads that span the campus for they aid travel and travel
is broadening.
The Y.W.C..A. is a worthwhile institution, does good
work, yet usually gets little praise for its effort.
The home is vital and valuable, protects the body tis
sues from the wild elements that tend to destroy it. The
Daily favors ihc protection of body tissues.
Yes, even the Student Manager is to be praised. We
don't know exactly why but the general spirit demands it.
The hearth too is commended because it is a swell place
lo dry one's feet. That is to say it is a swell place lo dry
one's feet if your feel are wet.

Hut the Daily goes further. We do not mean to infer
that organiazlions not mentioned do not have our sanction.
Only space prevents mentioning hundreds more that de
serve praise.
Hut this editorial will be used further to damn us for
our destructive spirit. The very organizations we praise
will say we are attacking them by innuendo. That will be
unfair.
N'othing is worse than to have our literal thoughts
treated subtly. That is, nothing is worse except lo have
:i subtle thought treated literally.
We praise ourselves for our constructive spirit. We
praise all who have read this editorial. We praise.

destructive attitude. We would do nothing about this nasty
hit of gossip except that the people who indulge in it take
such keen inner joy in pinning the destructive label on the
Daily. They swell within them at classifying themselves
constructive, classifying the Daily as destructive.
They assume that newspapers like cement mixers must
he constructive. They forget that only bv clearing away
the rot, can the beautiful be constructed. They forget that
there seems little point to singing hosannas when the air

Hut the Daily does agree with many things, and today
would like lo praise them.

The Post Office is to be congratulated and in the same
breath encouraged because postal systems facilitate the
communication of letters and postcards; also small pack
ages.
The Administration is to be complimented for having
roads that span the campus for they aid travel and travel
is broadening.
The Y.W.C..A. is a worthwhile institution, does good
work, yet usually gets little praise for its effort.
The home is vital and valuable, protects the body tis
sues from the wild elements that tend to destroy it. The
Daily favors ihc protection of body tissues.
Yes, even the Student Manager is to be praised. We
don't know exactly why but the general spirit demands it.
The hearth too is commended because it is a swell place
lo dry one's feet. That is to say it is a swell place lo dry
one's feet if your feel are wet.

Hut the Daily goes further. We do not mean to infer
that organiazlions not mentioned do not have our sanction.
Only space prevents mentioning hundreds more that de
serve praise.
Hut this editorial will be used further to damn us for
our destructive spirit. The very organizations we praise
will say we are attacking them by innuendo. That will be
unfair.

We praise ourselves for our constructive spirit. We
praise all who have read this editorial. We praise.
