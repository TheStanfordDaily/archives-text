# Professors and the President
## 
### 
A sure way lo keep an editorial from being read is to
start it with a statement about the NRA.
Well, then, in spite of the considerable resentment
against the NRA, there is little revolt against its ostensible
founder, President Roosevelt. The people have seen his
smile in the papers, and heard his voice over the radio,
and so the mass of the American public still firmly believes
in him.
The attacks on the NRA have not reflected upon the
wisdom of Roosevelt, but upon his "brain trust," the col
lege professors.
This is a very natural reaction. Americans have always
been somewhat suspicious of this breed. Movies, newspa
pers, and popular jokes have led the public to believe that
professors are absent-minded, impractical, and theorizing.
As a result, the layman has no faith in professorial ideas.
Roosevelt would do his personal reputation a lot of good
if he fired the whole lot of collegiate advisers, though he
might occasionally find himself at a loss for information,
imagination, and inspiration.
