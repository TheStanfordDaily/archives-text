# The 						Farm Isn't a Farm

Another overeoat was stolen from the Library.
That periodic announcement is usually just enough to
cause an editor to lament the passing of the honor spirit
among the students. For, as is well known, the honor spirit
extends hevond the classroom.
But very probably, these missing coats, missing wallets, ;
missing these and thoses are all due to other people who
Hit through this campus. It is very convenient to leave a
bit of personal properly just where we happen to be at the '
moment. Hut that little habit is apt to cause losseÂ®every I
now and then. This place isn't the little dairy-like nook it
once was. Droves of oullandcrs pour through; possibly,
some of them gain more than a peek at the Hoover Home !
and the Memorial Church during the stay.
Ol course, every now and then someone will lose a dry !
textbook, and then we know some classmate is the grafter, I
not the outsiders. Moral: Beware.
