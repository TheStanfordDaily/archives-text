### 
THE MASQUERADER
At the California Theatre
Superior adaptation, direction, and
acting have made this aged novel
and .stage play into a new and al
together absorbing film.
The story is so utterly impossible
as to have great romantic appeal:
John Chilcote, M.P. and drug ad
dict, employs John Loder, who ex
actly resembles him in every detail, 1
to assume his nam?, position, and .
responsibilities for a time. The at
tendant events are as impo<&ible as '
the original idea, and all carried out
in a pleasant manner. The denoue
ment is equally pleasant and im
possible.
Ronald Colman in the dual role
is far more successful than the usual ,
portrayer of a dual role. Aided by
intelligent photography, he manages
to avoid the ludicrous incongruity
generally accompanying such per
formances. Moreover, he manages
two genuinely differing interpreta- |
tions, and shades his work nicely
between the characters of the two
leading men, by skillful use of j
voice, gesture, makeup, and man- |
r.erisms.
One of the most impressive per- |
formances in the film—second only j
to the star's, I believe —is that of :
Halliwell Hobbes at the Chilcote '
butler. It is not an easy role, and '
it is handled with pleasing restraint
and dignity.
Elissa Landi makes an adequate
heroine, in a negligible role.
The accompanying program is i
ideal: news reel, Silly Symphony, 1
and Mickey Mouse —all excellent.

MANON (Massenet)
War Memorial Opera House
It is doubtless repetition to ob
serve that its Gallic gaiety and
naive good spirits make "Manon"
an opera always delightful to hear.
But it is these very qualities which
overbalance the insipidity of much
of its music and keep it from be
coming merely irrelevant.
Within the limitations of his tal
ent, Massenet achieved most com
pletely in "Manon'' what he set out
to do. He had less pretension than in
"Thais" and was content to gloss
his mise en scene with a pleasant
lyrical romanticism. If it lacks the
organic power and emotion of "Tra
viata"—a very similar opera in
theme—it is none the less charming.

I "Manon" requires about equal ef
! forts from both soprano and tenor,
and they must carry the entire op
era. The performance Tuesday was
fortunate in having a handsome, as
well as melodious, pair of lovers in
Lucreiza Bori and Dino Borgioli.
Their piquant singing and acting
i gave realistic conviction to the
creakings of the plot and admirably
' saved the evening from being a sac
i charine anticlimax to "Tristan.''
Eori made a demure and grace
ful French coquette. She used her
lovely, colorful voice with fine ac
cent and lucid phrasing. Her fortis
simo notes had firm, luscious tonal
pitch. Besides being a beautiful
woman, she has an ability for in
j telligent acting, whicn helped her to
get much humor out of the first
| scene and to make her passion in
ihe third act almost embarrassingly
! actual.
Tito Schipa's liquid singing has
, rather spoiled us for Des Grieux, but
Borgioli sang excellently after he
was well into the second act, where
; he executed some unusual variations
|on "Le Reve." His duets with Bori
were particularly good. The wobbly
kneed Gandolfi sang Lescaut with
j sharp but uneven gusto.
: The evening proceeded to the pla
| cid death scene with discreet melli
-1 fluence. Pelletier, too, kept the or
chestra well controlled.

THE MASQUERADER
At the California Theatre
Superior adaptation, direction, and
acting have made this aged novel
and .stage play into a new and al
together absorbing film.
The story is so utterly impossible
as to have great romantic appeal:
John Chilcote, M.P. and drug ad
dict, employs John Loder, who ex
actly resembles him in every detail, 1
to assume his nam?, position, and .
responsibilities for a time. The at
tendant events are as impo<&ible as '
the original idea, and all carried out
in a pleasant manner. The denoue
ment is equally pleasant and im
possible.
Ronald Colman in the dual role
is far more successful than the usual ,
portrayer of a dual role. Aided by
intelligent photography, he manages
to avoid the ludicrous incongruity
generally accompanying such per
formances. Moreover, he manages
two genuinely differing interpreta- |
tions, and shades his work nicely
between the characters of the two
leading men, by skillful use of j
voice, gesture, makeup, and man- |
r.erisms.
One of the most impressive per- |
formances in the film—second only j
to the star's, I believe —is that of :
Halliwell Hobbes at the Chilcote '
butler. It is not an easy role, and '
it is handled with pleasing restraint
and dignity.
Elissa Landi makes an adequate
heroine, in a negligible role.
The accompanying program is i
ideal: news reel, Silly Symphony, 1
and Mickey Mouse —all excellent.
