through the line; Oregon State has
"Red" Frai,iklin who they are hail
ing as the sweetest prospect the
Coast has developed for a good long
while.
And, of course, the Golden Bear
is proud of halfback Arleigh Wil
li;.ms, understudy lo Hank Shaldach

of the place now. Williams leads
the Coast Conference gridmen in
points scored, having edged out Bill
