# NEW YORK CAN COMPARE ACE BACKS
## 
### 
The New Yorkers will have full
opportunity to compare Oregon
State's blazing red-head Franklin,
with the ice-house boy from St.
Mary's when the Beavers meet
Fordham this Saturday. The Beav
ers are well remembered in New
York for the trip they made back to
humble a great New York Univer
sity team several years back. How
ard Maple was then doing the high
low down for the Webfeet, and he
showed the East everything a good
quarterback should have.
Southern California will be meet
ing two intersectional opponents of
distinction in successive weeks when
they play Notre Dams November 25,
and Georgia the following week. The
Kainblers of Notre Dame have had
their glory considerably dimmed of
late, but the game has built up a
certain traditional interest.
The Trojans may be tackling a
tartar in the shape of Georgia. The
soft-speaking boys are undefeated,
although they have Auburn and
Georgia Tech yet to conquer. The
rambling wrecks from Tech have
been upset twice, by Kentucky, 7-6,
and Tulane, 7-0. —Hamilton
