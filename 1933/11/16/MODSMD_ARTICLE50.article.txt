# GRIDDERS PREPARE TO MEET MONTANA WITH STIFF DRILL
## Tiny Fears Pass Attack Of Visiting Aggregation 
### Oliver Johnston, Jr 
The Southern, California victory
is now a thing of the past, and Tiny
Thornhill last night put his Indian
heroes through a stiff drill against
Montana's passing plays.
Thornhill is not taking this game
lightly. Montana is reputed to have
a strong passing attack, which is
proved by the fact that they took
to the air and defeated the power
ful Gonzaga outfit 13-7. They held
the strong Washington State team
to a one touchdown victory. By
comparative scores Montana is equal
to S.F.U.
Hilhnan Will Start
The starting line-up for Saturday,
which is subject to change, will be
the first string, with the exception
of Hillman, who will replace the in
jured Bobby Grayson. Grayson is
still on crutches and will probably
not see any action against Montana.
A large part of the session last
night was taken up with Hilhnan,
Alustiza, and Todd heaving passes.
Only one pass fell incomplete m
the Trojan game, and with this great
reputation to live up to a lot of work
is necessary.
Moscrip's Run Puzzles
Bones Hamilton and Monk Mos
crip were not out last night. Both
of them are suffering from bad colds.
A good many spectators, sports
writers, and coaches are still trying
to figure out how the play worked
on which Moscrip carried the ball
for 30 yards. Monk started at left
end and finished up running down
the left sideline, while the play
called for a wide sweep to the right.
Ben Palamountain, Stanford's long
lost tackle, may be in shape to play
a bit Saturday. He has not scrim
maged since his injury but has run
through signal drill for the past
week.
