# Chappie Fears Trinklebaaaaa
## 
### Tinkle Molehill 
When asked what f thought of the
Chappie pass defense, I remarked
that the Daily will concentrate on
battering thrusts over Thristlewitch
Algarstern, Old Boy's left tackle.
There is no reason why the Daily's
pony fullback, Johnny Drofnats, j
I can't thread the Old Boy ends for
(substantial field goals.
Willowy Threat
Trinklebaaaaa-no period Kellogg
bee, fifth string left halfback on the
Daily Goof squad, will assume a
period in time for the fray Saturday
afternoon, and if he does, he will be
1 a constant threat as. he flings his
willowy body against oval, swarthy
faced, red-haired, his ear stick out a
mile, bow-Lagged, knock-kneed, Svi
lich Zcuertzki (Thristleswitch II)
Algarstern, brother of Thristles
"witch Algarstern, the Chappie cap
tain.
Politics has ruined the Chappie
1 team. Candidates (or salesgirls po
sitions have threatened to quit the
squad, but the Daily, sportsmanlike
as ever, will make no alibi if Chap
pie loses.
Only Ficc Safeties
Only a 11-2 victory will satisfy
me: I am counting on Trinklebaaaa
no period Kellogg, etc., to throw
Thristleswitch I for five safeties. We
will get the other point when Thris
tleswitch Us ineligibility has been
revealed after the game.

Braves of Monterey commented to
me before practice that if Hetty
Bare Fedden came to the game he
would score at least twice; that if
J Flaine Brisk came, four touchdowns,
a safety, and a forfeit. The coaching
I staff will take Misses Fedden and
Brisk to Ihe game myself.
