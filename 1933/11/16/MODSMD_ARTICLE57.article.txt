## 
### 
By Gray Creveling
For 20 years Stanford and the
Olympic Club have ruled North
ern California water polo, and
when these two teams meet Fri
day night at the clubmen's pool
the most closely contested game
of the autumn round will result.
The winner of this game and the
similar contest to follow in Febru
i ary will probably be the champion
of Northern California's Water Polo
League.
Winged "O"' Slipping
History of this most traditional of
water polo contests reveals that the
Winged O's have had the upper
hand for a longer period than has
Stanford, which has only recently
| begun to outclass the Olympians.
I After 10 years without a defeat,
1 the Olympic Club fell only to Stan
! ford back in 1931 when the great
j Cardinal team began. In that year
Stanford defeated the clubmen twice
and tied once. Since then the teams
have had only two games a year,
and in 1932 the Indians won and
lost one. But last winter the Cards
came through to win both games,
also the newly formed N.C.W.P.
I League.
During their 10 undefeated years
of water polo playing, the Olympic
Clubmen won the senior National
A.A.U. honors three times.
Work Hard
Since 1931 Stanford has won over
the Olympians five times, has lost
once, tied once.
In preparing his men for this most
important game, Coach Nort Thorn
ton has made the boys scrimmage
each afternoon for 50 minutes of
stamina-testing play.
Stanford anxiously wonders if
Ted Wiget will play for the club
men. Signed with the Olympic Club,
but not yet having played with them,
Wiget and the possibility of his
playing against the Cards are two
, other worries for Stanford Coach
: Thornton.
