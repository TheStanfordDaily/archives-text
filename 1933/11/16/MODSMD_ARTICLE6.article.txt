# Tumbling Dollar
## 
### 
Louder and louder grew the noise
of the falling dollar yesterday. For
eign exchanges closed with the
pound at $s.4o—record high, dollars
worth 59 cents, a record day's drop.
R.F.C. gold price .stayed the same at
$33.56 —also an all-t'me high. Prob
able cause for all this: sound-money
men Woodin and Acheson leaving
the Treasury, panicky American in
vestors trying to get their money
into francs and pounds.
R.F.C. is trying to put the brakes
on the skidding dollar, is holding
gold price steady. But U.S. stocks
do not rise, remain sluggish. Mean
while. American tourists, expatriates
abroad, etc., watch their dwindling
money, ponder cruel fate.
