# STANFORD ACTORS TO BE IN CAST OF PALO ALTO DRAMA
## 
### 
Leslie and Chrysella Kiler, well
known Stanford graduates and for
mer art directors of the University
theatrical workshop here, have de
signed and supervised the construc
tion of the two stage sets for "Paris
Bound," a three-act sophisticated
American comedy by Philip Barry
to be presented at the new civic
theatre in Rinconada Park, Middle
field Road at Melville, Friday and
Saturday evenings at 8:15 o'clock.
Mrs. Kiler, who is costume mistress
for the Palo Alto Community Play
ers, also has had experience in stage
craft work at the Cape Cod summer
theatre.
The set for the first act is the up
stairs living-room of a country home
near New York City, and forms ihe
locale for the festivities of the wed
ding breakfast of Jim and Mary
Hutton, with which the play opens.
For the second and third acts, the
artists have designed an ultra-mod
ern music-room in a fashionable
New York town house, such as
might belong to a family of the up
per middle class. The very suavity
and beautiful smoothness of the
playwright's lines will be colored by
the sophistication of the cleverly
designed settings.
Other Stanfordites included in the
staff for the production are: Clif
ford Church, house manager; Ches
ter Wing Barker, box office assis
tant; and Elwyn Bugge, instructor
in Physical Education and Hygiene,
who is the director of the orchestra
for the Palo Alto Community Play
ers.
Reserved seats are 50 cents each at
the Community House (P.A. 21711).
