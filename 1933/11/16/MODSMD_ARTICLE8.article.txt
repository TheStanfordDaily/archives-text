### Dick Strouse 
Accomplishing what no collegiate
eleven has been able to do since
I early in the 1931 season, Stanford's
: Indians bit the dust yesterday after
jnoon, masticated it thoroughly, and
i then (horrid word) spit in the sur
prised face of the proud Don from
S.F.U. to register a brilliant 3 to 2
soccer win against the team that
boasts a goodly proportion of the
population of Scotland in its line-up.
The impressive, decisive victory
i followed three years of tearful ties
i with, or losses to, the proud Don,
| and was made possible by an ag
gressive overmade halfback named
Doug Kennedy who lent the hitherto

missing punch to what was yester
day a great forward line, and by a
lithe young 'Apollo named Waddie
White who covered most of the field
: and all of the visiting team in de
structive fashion. Guided by John
nie Moore, the smartest center-half
, in the League, these two and nine
other men who each did a bit more
than his share scored thrice on sheer
power before S.F.U.'s brilliant young
center broke away from the tough
Stanford defense for two second
| half tallies.
Perfection Is Rewarded
The first score came before the
i handsome Don realized that his
i pristine beauty was despoiled. Early
in the first quarter Captain Carl
Knecht looped a corner kick that
! twisted and burned its way through
; the hands of a capable S.F.U. goalie
1 on its own perfection.
Followed minutes of Cardinal
; colored play when White, Moore,
and smooth-passing Rudy Gonzalez
kept the ball in S.F.U. territory and
1 the eyes of Stanford's underworked
fullbacks on a carload of cheering
feminity. The carload upon investi
gation, divulged itself as Miss Reese's
| class in Soccer Technique for the
' hardier of the "800." Thought, the
girls: "My, what a rough game."
That Man Kennedy
Having gazed their full, the over
i signed passed to fullback Johnson
' who passed to wing Doddington who
i passed to center Hearn who, not
wanting the ball anyway, repassed
;to Doddington who, generous, too,
dropped a high one in front of the
i goal which the irrepressible Mr.
I Kennedy blithly kicked into the net.
Whereupon Mike Gomez, having
waited till the third quarter and
| having played up to his ability which
j is the height of something or other
darned good, took his turn to score.
With a 3 to 0 lead against the
"unbeatable" Dons, Gomez, Ken
