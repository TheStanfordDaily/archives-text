# CARDS' 3-2 WIN SHATTERS S.F.U. SOCCER RECORD
## Stanford Outplays League Leaders as Indians' Offense Clicks WHITE, KENNEDY, STAR Carl Knecht Starts 3-Goal Scoring Spree 
### Dick Strouse 
Accomplishing what no collegiate
eleven has been able to do since
I early in the 1931 season, Stanford's
: Indians bit the dust yesterday after
jnoon, masticated it thoroughly, and
i then (horrid word) spit in the sur
prised face of the proud Don from
S.F.U. to register a brilliant 3 to 2
soccer win against the team that
boasts a goodly proportion of the
population of Scotland in its line-up.
The impressive, decisive victory
i followed three years of tearful ties
i with, or losses to, the proud Don,
| and was made possible by an ag
gressive overmade halfback named
Doug Kennedy who lent the hitherto

missing punch to what was yester
day a great forward line, and by a
lithe young 'Apollo named Waddie
White who covered most of the field
: and all of the visiting team in de
structive fashion. Guided by John
nie Moore, the smartest center-half
, in the League, these two and nine
other men who each did a bit more
than his share scored thrice on sheer
power before S.F.U.'s brilliant young
center broke away from the tough
Stanford defense for two second
| half tallies.
Perfection Is Rewarded
The first score came before the
i handsome Don realized that his
i pristine beauty was despoiled. Early
in the first quarter Captain Carl
Knecht looped a corner kick that
! twisted and burned its way through
; the hands of a capable S.F.U. goalie
1 on its own perfection.
Followed minutes of Cardinal
; colored play when White, Moore,
and smooth-passing Rudy Gonzalez
kept the ball in S.F.U. territory and
1 the eyes of Stanford's underworked
fullbacks on a carload of cheering
feminity. The carload upon investi
gation, divulged itself as Miss Reese's
| class in Soccer Technique for the
' hardier of the "800." Thought, the
girls: "My, what a rough game."
That Man Kennedy
Having gazed their full, the over
i signed passed to fullback Johnson
' who passed to wing Doddington who
i passed to center Hearn who, not
wanting the ball anyway, repassed
;to Doddington who, generous, too,
dropped a high one in front of the
i goal which the irrepressible Mr.
I Kennedy blithly kicked into the net.
Whereupon Mike Gomez, having
waited till the third quarter and
| having played up to his ability which
j is the height of something or other
darned good, took his turn to score.
With a 3 to 0 lead against the
"unbeatable" Dons, Gomez, Ken
nedy, and a tow-headed demon on
defense named Sven Doddinf/on,
dropped back to lend their sk'jl to
harassed but happy Indian I jacks.
S.F.U. scored once when the Card
fulls were fooled by a Don forward,
again when a general melee i
in someone's lucky kick tl-j;it Jack
King could not see and therefore
could not stop.
The game was a person; Jf triumph
for Captain Knecht and a fighting
bundle of nerves named Art Hearn,
who have starred on Stanford soccer
teams for three years Ijrut till yes
terday never enjoyed the support
necessary to win over the Dons.
Yesterday a team that clicked and
their own skill and 'aggression al
lowed Knecht and FtCarn to laugh
last with the fainj memory of
horses of other colors a pleasant
echo in their ears. ,
Back by the cl jeering feminity
and the stark wKnte uprights, Cy
Johnson played in n fashion to bring
memories of tlu> great Buster
Holmes surging to the minds of soc
cer fans to whom. Holmes and full
back excellcnce are synonoinus.
King and Milt ."Newman (who re
placed Jack when shadows fell over
the field and the all-Conference
goalie's eyes couldn't stand the
strain of distinguishing between a
soccer ball and the dark horizon at

night) snuggled the few enemy
i shots to their tummies and calmly
flipped dangerous corner-kicks over
the goal
The game was clean, probably due
to the 'familiarity that, among fel
lows who play soccer because they
like the game, breeds respect rather
than familiarity. Even the rough
tough tactics of Johnnie Hitchcock,
the finest substitute halfback in col
legiate soccer, were performed in a
friendly and incidentally very capa
ble fashion.
The Don h.-js reigned. Yesterday it
rained Stanford - propelled soccer
1 balls and the Don fell. Kennedy
supplied the missing link; White was
told by Coach Harry Maloncy after
the game, ''I don't see how one man
could do it - '; Gomez found himself;
, the rest of us did our share. Cali
fornia, here we come!

S.F.U. scored once when the Card

The game was a person; Jf triumph
for Captain Knecht and a fighting
bundle of nerves named Art Hearn,
who have starred on Stanford soccer
teams for three years Ijrut till yes
terday never enjoyed the support
necessary to win over the Dons.
Yesterday a team that clicked and

lowed Knecht and FtCarn to laugh

King and Milt ."Newman (who re
placed Jack when shadows fell over
the field and the all-Conference
goalie's eyes couldn't stand the
strain of distinguishing between a
soccer ball and the dark horizon at

night) snuggled the few enemy
i shots to their tummies and calmly
flipped dangerous corner-kicks over
the goal
The game was clean, probably due
to the 'familiarity that, among fel
lows who play soccer because they
like the game, breeds respect rather
than familiarity. Even the rough
tough tactics of Johnnie Hitchcock,
the finest substitute halfback in col
legiate soccer, were performed in a
friendly and incidentally very capa
ble fashion.
The Don h.-js reigned. Yesterday it
rained Stanford - propelled soccer
1 balls and the Don fell. Kennedy
supplied the missing link; White was
told by Coach Harry Maloncy after
the game, ''I don't see how one man
could do it - '; Gomez found himself;
, the rest of us did our share. Cali
fornia, here we come!
Accomplishing what no collegiate
eleven has been able to do since
I early in the 1931 season, Stanford's
: Indians bit the dust yesterday after
jnoon, masticated it thoroughly, and
i then (horrid word) spit in the sur
prised face of the proud Don from
S.F.U. to register a brilliant 3 to 2
soccer win against the team that
boasts a goodly proportion of the
population of Scotland in its line-up.
The impressive, decisive victory
i followed three years of tearful ties
i with, or losses to, the proud Don,
| and was made possible by an ag
gressive overmade halfback named
Doug Kennedy who lent the hitherto

missing punch to what was yester
day a great forward line, and by a
lithe young 'Apollo named Waddie
White who covered most of the field
: and all of the visiting team in de
structive fashion. Guided by John
nie Moore, the smartest center-half
, in the League, these two and nine
other men who each did a bit more
than his share scored thrice on sheer
power before S.F.U.'s brilliant young
center broke away from the tough
Stanford defense for two second
| half tallies.
Perfection Is Rewarded
The first score came before the
i handsome Don realized that his
i pristine beauty was despoiled. Early
in the first quarter Captain Carl
Knecht looped a corner kick that
! twisted and burned its way through
; the hands of a capable S.F.U. goalie
1 on its own perfection.
Followed minutes of Cardinal
; colored play when White, Moore,
and smooth-passing Rudy Gonzalez
kept the ball in S.F.U. territory and
1 the eyes of Stanford's underworked
fullbacks on a carload of cheering
feminity. The carload upon investi
gation, divulged itself as Miss Reese's
| class in Soccer Technique for the
' hardier of the "800." Thought, the
girls: "My, what a rough game."
That Man Kennedy
Having gazed their full, the over
i signed passed to fullback Johnson
' who passed to wing Doddington who
i passed to center Hearn who, not
wanting the ball anyway, repassed
;to Doddington who, generous, too,
dropped a high one in front of the
i goal which the irrepressible Mr.
I Kennedy blithly kicked into the net.
Whereupon Mike Gomez, having
waited till the third quarter and
| having played up to his ability which
j is the height of something or other
darned good, took his turn to score.
With a 3 to 0 lead against the
"unbeatable" Dons, Gomez, Ken
nedy, and a tow-headed demon on
defense named Sven Doddinf/on,
dropped back to lend their sk'jl to
harassed but happy Indian I jacks.

, in the League, these two and nine
other men who each did a bit more
than his share scored thrice on sheer
power before S.F.U.'s brilliant young
center broke away from the tough
Stanford defense for two second
| half tallies.
Perfection Is Rewarded
The first score came before the
i handsome Don realized that his
i pristine beauty was despoiled. Early
in the first quarter Captain Carl
Knecht looped a corner kick that
! twisted and burned its way through
; the hands of a capable S.F.U. goalie
1 on its own perfection.
Followed minutes of Cardinal
; colored play when White, Moore,
and smooth-passing Rudy Gonzalez
kept the ball in S.F.U. territory and
1 the eyes of Stanford's underworked
fullbacks on a carload of cheering
feminity. The carload upon investi
gation, divulged itself as Miss Reese's
| class in Soccer Technique for the
' hardier of the "800." Thought, the
girls: "My, what a rough game."
That Man Kennedy
Having gazed their full, the over
i signed passed to fullback Johnson
' who passed to wing Doddington who
i passed to center Hearn who, not
wanting the ball anyway, repassed
;to Doddington who, generous, too,
dropped a high one in front of the
i goal which the irrepressible Mr.
I Kennedy blithly kicked into the net.
Whereupon Mike Gomez, having
waited till the third quarter and
| having played up to his ability which
j is the height of something or other
darned good, took his turn to score.
With a 3 to 0 lead against the
"unbeatable" Dons, Gomez, Ken
nedy, and a tow-headed demon on
defense named Sven Doddinf/on,
dropped back to lend their sk'jl to
harassed but happy Indian I jacks.
S.F.U. scored once when the Card
fulls were fooled by a Don forward,
again when a general melee i
in someone's lucky kick tl-j;it Jack
King could not see and therefore
could not stop.
The game was a person; Jf triumph
for Captain Knecht and a fighting
bundle of nerves named Art Hearn,
who have starred on Stanford soccer
teams for three years Ijrut till yes
terday never enjoyed the support
necessary to win over the Dons.
Yesterday a team that clicked and
their own skill and 'aggression al
lowed Knecht and FtCarn to laugh
last with the fainj memory of
horses of other colors a pleasant
echo in their ears. ,
Back by the cl jeering feminity
and the stark wKnte uprights, Cy
Johnson played in n fashion to bring
memories of tlu> great Buster
Holmes surging to the minds of soc
cer fans to whom. Holmes and full
back excellcnce are synonoinus.
King and Milt ."Newman (who re
placed Jack when shadows fell over
the field and the all-Conference
goalie's eyes couldn't stand the
strain of distinguishing between a
soccer ball and the dark horizon at

night) snuggled the few enemy
i shots to their tummies and calmly
flipped dangerous corner-kicks over
the goal
The game was clean, probably due
to the 'familiarity that, among fel
lows who play soccer because they
like the game, breeds respect rather
than familiarity. Even the rough
tough tactics of Johnnie Hitchcock,
the finest substitute halfback in col
legiate soccer, were performed in a
friendly and incidentally very capa
ble fashion.
The Don h.-js reigned. Yesterday it
rained Stanford - propelled soccer
1 balls and the Don fell. Kennedy
supplied the missing link; White was
told by Coach Harry Maloncy after
the game, ''I don't see how one man
could do it - '; Gomez found himself;
, the rest of us did our share. Cali
fornia, here we come!
Accomplishing what no collegiate
eleven has been able to do since
I early in the 1931 season, Stanford's
: Indians bit the dust yesterday after
jnoon, masticated it thoroughly, and
i then (horrid word) spit in the sur
prised face of the proud Don from
S.F.U. to register a brilliant 3 to 2
soccer win against the team that
boasts a goodly proportion of the
population of Scotland in its line-up.
The impressive, decisive victory
i followed three years of tearful ties
i with, or losses to, the proud Don,
| and was made possible by an ag
gressive overmade halfback named
Doug Kennedy who lent the hitherto

missing punch to what was yester
day a great forward line, and by a
lithe young 'Apollo named Waddie
White who covered most of the field
: and all of the visiting team in de
structive fashion. Guided by John
nie Moore, the smartest center-half
, in the League, these two and nine
other men who each did a bit more
than his share scored thrice on sheer
power before S.F.U.'s brilliant young
center broke away from the tough
Stanford defense for two second
| half tallies.
