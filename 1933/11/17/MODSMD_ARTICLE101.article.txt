# CARDS VS. AGILE OLYMPIC TANKMEN IN MEET TONIGHT
## 
### Gray Creveling 
The teams which Coach Nort ,
> Thornton calls "the two finest wa
ter polo squads in the league"— )
Stanford and the Olympic Club —
meet tonight in the clubmen's Post
Street pool at 8:30 o'clock.
With "If the Olympic Club gets
a three-goal lead. I hate to think
of the result," Stanford's Thornton
expresses his lack of faith in the
Cards' coming back against the
Winged "O's" if the clubmen get
an early lead.
The varsity poloists have proven '
• themselves a second - half "come- |
back" squad, but the Olympians are
| strong enough to stop any such ef
fort.
Coach Thornton is particularly
worried about his offense, severely
disapproving of the teams' "makin' j
up their own plays." Dullness has J
characterized play execution for the
last two days.
Stanford's scoring hopes rest with !
Vlad Taranik and Jimmy Triolo. 1
Taranik burns 'em in, and Triolo j
is famed for trick shots.
The Olympic Club's great threats
are- forwards Ginger Austin and
Wilkinson; Mitchell, one of the
guards, is a constant worry. His j
long shots from anywhere in the [
I tank fooled Rhodes scholar Burke 1
Knapp, Card goalie, time and again ,
in last year's game.
Clubmen's goalie, Elmer Collette, |
and Ginger Austin are former Stan- j
| ford men and members of the 1924 I
I U.S. Olympic team.
