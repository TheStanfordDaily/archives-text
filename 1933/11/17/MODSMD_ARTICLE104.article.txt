# TWO COAST GAMES WILL DECIDE CARD ROSE BOWL AIMS
## 
### 
Whether the West's representative
in the annual New Year's Day in
tersectional clash in the Pasadena
Rose Bowl will come from the
northwest or from California will
probably be decided in the Los An
geles Coliseum Saturday when Con
ference leading Oregon meets Uni
versity of Southern California, the
fallen king.
Oregon on Top
With three Conference victories
;ind no defeats, Oregon's record is
the best on the Pacific Coast and if
they can trounce Troy, they will
virtually be assured an invitation
from Pasadena, provided they can
clear the St. Mary's hurdle Novem
ber 30. If the Trojans come back,
the winner of the Big Game will
probably be selected.
An entire team of veterans fea
turing a strong baekfield, headed by
"Iron Mike" Mikulak, makes the
Webfeet a heavy threat. After the
shake-up instituted by Coach How
ard Jones following last Saturday's
game, the Trojans will be out to
prove that they cannot yet be
counted out of the picture.
Sunday brings one of the Coast's
outstanding annual battles to San
Francisco when St. Mary's and San
ta Clara clash at Kezar Stadium.
Odds favor the Gaels slightly at
present, but past performances don't
count for much in this game.
N.Y. Battle
Oregon State bears the banner of
the Pacific Coast into the East this
week-end when they meet Fordham
in New York in the Rams' second
encounter of the season with a
Western team. St. Mary's previously
whipped Fordham 13 to (i.
Stanford and California play
breather contests with Montana and
Idaho, respectively, but both may
find themselves in tougher games
than they had counted on. Wee
Willis Smith especially makes Idaho
a threat. Weighing but 150 pounds,
Smith has been a thorn in the side
of every team the Vandals have met
for two years, and Idaho followers
claim he is the best open field run
ner in the West.
U.C.L.A. travels north to meet
Washington in the remaining of the
week's Conference games. Having
tied California two weeks ago while
the Huskies lost a 33 to 0 decision
to the same team last week, U.C.L.A.
might be installed as overwhelming
favorites were it not for the fact
that both teams lost to Oregon 7 to
0 and that southern teams always
seem to experience tiouble in north
ern fields.
Washington State rests this week
in preparation for their big game
with the Huskies next Saturday.

Oregon State bears the banner of
the Pacific Coast into the East this
week-end when they meet Fordham
in New York in the Rams' second
encounter of the season with a
Western team. St. Mary's previously
whipped Fordham 13 to (i.
Stanford and California play
breather contests with Montana and
Idaho, respectively, but both may
find themselves in tougher games
than they had counted on. Wee
Willis Smith especially makes Idaho
a threat. Weighing but 150 pounds,
Smith has been a thorn in the side
of every team the Vandals have met
for two years, and Idaho followers
claim he is the best open field run
ner in the West.
U.C.L.A. travels north to meet
Washington in the remaining of the
week's Conference games. Having
tied California two weeks ago while
the Huskies lost a 33 to 0 decision
to the same team last week, U.C.L.A.
might be installed as overwhelming
favorites were it not for the fact
that both teams lost to Oregon 7 to
0 and that southern teams always
seem to experience tiouble in north
ern fields.
Washington State rests this week
in preparation for their big game
with the Huskies next Saturday.
Whether the West's representative
in the annual New Year's Day in
tersectional clash in the Pasadena
Rose Bowl will come from the
northwest or from California will
probably be decided in the Los An
geles Coliseum Saturday when Con
ference leading Oregon meets Uni
versity of Southern California, the
fallen king.
Oregon on Top
With three Conference victories
;ind no defeats, Oregon's record is
the best on the Pacific Coast and if
they can trounce Troy, they will
virtually be assured an invitation
from Pasadena, provided they can
clear the St. Mary's hurdle Novem
ber 30. If the Trojans come back,
the winner of the Big Game will
probably be selected.
An entire team of veterans fea
turing a strong baekfield, headed by
"Iron Mike" Mikulak, makes the
Webfeet a heavy threat. After the
shake-up instituted by Coach How
ard Jones following last Saturday's
game, the Trojans will be out to
prove that they cannot yet be
counted out of the picture.
Sunday brings one of the Coast's
outstanding annual battles to San
Francisco when St. Mary's and San
ta Clara clash at Kezar Stadium.
Odds favor the Gaels slightly at
present, but past performances don't
count for much in this game.
N.Y. Battle
