# DROFNATS BUM BACK Last Dope Almost Perfect PICKS MORE WINNERS
## 
### 
Smoking a 50-cent El Stencherino
Trojano, Slyvestre Drofnats arrived
home from Los Angeles yesterday,
, via the Southern Pacific freight and
Smokey Joe's grog house. Proud
was Syl of the almost perfect week
he enjoyed after correctly calling
10 games out of 12 attempted, miss
ing one, and getting one tie. The
Oregon State-Oregon game, where
he refused to run with the mob and
, call Oregon, was his only error.
Yesterday he was ready to put his
head in the lion's mouth again, and
declared Santa Clara will take St. 1
Mary's, thus hushing all poppycock
about a post-season game for Stan
-1 ford and St. Mary's.
Furthermore, says Sylvestre, SC.
will have trouble beating Oregon, j
land Oregon State will dump Ford
ham and keep the West's record i
clear.
