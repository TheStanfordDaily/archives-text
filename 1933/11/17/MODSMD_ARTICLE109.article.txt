Members of Loma Prieta Chapter j

their wind by climbing to the sum- ;

All residents of the campus whose j
legs crave an outing are invited to
meet in front of the Stanford Book

the group will drive to the end of
the Soda Springs Road, Los Gatos,
before striking for the summit, a
meager three milesâ€”straight up.
C. A. Davidson of Palo Alto and j
John Young of Los Gatos will lead
the party. Bring lunches, canteens, !
and if possible a car.
Previous hikes during the recent
quarter have included students j
from Stanford and San Jose State, j
Further details may be obtained
from John Springer of the Econom
ics Department.
The German "Big Bertha" long
range gun was named in honor of

ter of the famous "Iron Master."
