Coward-Like Skit
Patterned on Noel Coward's "Pri
vate Lives" and written by Katrina
Wallingford, one lead skit" in the
Gaieties of 1933 is hailed by direc-
I tors as px - omising. "Absolutely the
finest sketch ever written by a Stan
ford student," declared Director
Harold Helvenston, commenting on
Miss Wallingford's "Even More Pri
-1 vate."
Her recent triumph in the read-
I ing of Sword and Sandals' "Hay
Fever," also a Coward product, to
gether with her work at present in
! "Paris Bound," now playing at the
Palo Alto Community Playhouse,
lead observers to predict a sensa
tion when Miss Wallingford ap-
I pears in her own skit.
Male Lead Not Known
Repeated efforts by reporters to
discover the identity of the male
lead chosen to play opposite the au
thor have proved unsuccessful, al
though it is assured he is promi
nent in campus dramatic circles.
Another new melody accepted by
Gaieties directors is "Hour Old
Love," by Oliver Johnston. A1
Woodward will sing it in the Big
Game presentation.
Hcchc Contributes
Men's parts in the Gibson Girl
chorus are still open, says Director
Helvenston, who added that all
sketches go on review Saturday
morning between 10 and 12 o'clock.
) Gordon Heche, music director, has
contributed much to the melody
phase of the Gaieties both in ar
rangements and original composi-
I tions.
