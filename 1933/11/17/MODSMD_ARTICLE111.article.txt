With weather becoming more«
'wintry each week, today's Stanford
inter-squad track and field meet j
may produce the best times and dis- j
tances of the fall off-season pro
gram.
Climatic conditions during the
past four days of practice, pro
nounced ideal by Coach Dink Tem
pleton, have fired several Indian po
tential champions with the notion
of bettering their top marks for this
season this afternoon at Angell
Field.
Fresh Offer Competition
Freshman newcomers.who finished
with football last week may offer
varsity candidates some competition
in a few events. Coach Bill Elling
ton is anxious to see Fred Williams |
and Chuck Voigt, heralded sprinters,
in action. Williams may not com
pete in the dash events, however,
because of a slight injury sustained
during the gridiron season. He'
probably will press Johnny Mott
-lam in the javelin; Williams tossed
the speak- 189 feet in high school, j

Jim Reynolds has shown poten
tialities in the shot put, and he may
j sneak in for a second behind Johnny
| Lyman. The latter has hopes of bet
tering 50 feet; he has put the ball
within a few inches of this mark
m all three meets.
High Jump Honors
Lloyd Schween and Don Albert
son probably will capture honors in
the high jump, but Miguel Gon
zales, first-year man, has .sailed over
the bar when poised at 5 feet 10
inches several times Jlis season.
With practice for the cross-coun
try run keeping them in good con
dition, distance men bid fair to make
outstanding marks this afternoon.
Norm Bright, captain of the cross
j country squad but not eligible for
track next spring, ran the 2-mile in
9 minutes 43.1 seconds two weeks
ago, and he shows promise of ap
proaching or bettering this today.
Sprinters and middle distance
runners are still doubtful, and the
marks may fall below the average
i of the field in the short: r races.
