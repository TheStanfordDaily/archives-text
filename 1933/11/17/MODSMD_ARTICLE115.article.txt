# Pistol Shooters Asked To Report for Practice
## 
### 
Men interested in the Stanford
pistol team are to report to the rifle
and pistol range under the Admin
istration building on Monday and
Tuesday nights. The range will be
open on those nights from 7 to 8
o'clock and an army officer will be
in attendance to help coach begin
ners.
Since practice is even more im
portant in pistol work than in rifle
shooting, Major Williams points out
the necessity for a good deal of fir
ing to be conducted during the next
few weeks if Stanford is to make a
good showing in the matches to be
held next quarter.
The schedule is now being ar
ranged and will include postal
matches with other schools and
R.O.T.C. units and the posibility of
shoulder to shoulder matches with
nearby teams. Ammunition is avail
able at wholesale prices and pistols
are furnished by the Military De
partment.
