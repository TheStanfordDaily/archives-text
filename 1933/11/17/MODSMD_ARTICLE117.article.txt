# STANFORD HARRIERS TRAINING FOR MEET
## 
### 
With three months of asiduous
running a thing of the past, Coach
Brutus Hamilton's cross - country
team looks pretty good, good
enough, in fact, to extend Bright,
Nimmo, Ferric, Devlin, Azevedo, et
al. to the utmost across the rolling
greensward of the Stanford golf
links in the second annual meet,
slated for Big Game morning.
Dana Raymond, who gained his
endurance skiing up and ddwn Cal
ifornia snowslopes, is the best bet
at present for the four-mile grind,
closely followed by two former
members of the champion Piedmont
High team, Clay Harrold and Bob
Fowler, both promising sophomores.
Bob Raftery, husky and brick
topper, the best middle-distance man
on the team, finds the long race
pretty hard with his short legs and
short stride. Following along are
Woodrow Kitchell, fast miler, Lyle
Reynolds, track captain-elect and
1:57 880 man, and Henry Anderson,
an experienced distance man.
