# Press Club Searching For Member Prospects
## 
### 
In an effort to affiliate all stu
dents who are interested in journal
ism, members of Stanford Press
Club arc circulating about the Farm
in search of prospective members
for this dues-free organization.
At Wednesday's meeting, the club
decided that all round-table dis
cussions with outside speakers
henceforth will be limited only to
active members and guests. Last
year several meetings were so over
run with outsiders that all efforts
at round-table sessions were de
feated and the "conferences" turned
into what .approached formal lec
tures.
Only students majoring in jour
nalism or having connections with
campus publications are eligible for
membership, and only those can
vote. A program featuring promi
nent journalists of the Bay region
is being worked out for the balance
of the school year.
