# ROTHERT RETURNS FROM SERIES OF S.C. GAME RALLIES
## 
### 
Back from a humbled southland 1
with its stricken Trojan horse, '
Alumni Secretary Harlow Rothert
brings with him enthusiastic re
ports of Stanford meetings and ral
lies held before the S C. game.
The week started with a meeting
in San Jose with Dr. Wilbur, Deans
Yost and Culver, J. E. McDowel), i
and Tiny Thornhill as guests of
honor. Then followed gatherings at
Visalia, with Rothert as a speaker;
Glendale, with Dean Culver and J.
E. McDowell guests; Santa Bar
bara, with Dink Templeton and Ro
ihert in attendance; and Covina,
with Rothert again guest of honor.
L.A. Rallies
Climaxing the pre-game alumni
activities were rallies in Los An
geles Friday; 150 women met in
the Women's Athletic Club during
the afternoon with Almon Roth,
Carol Green Wilson, and Harlow
Rothert as speakers,. Nearly 400
men gathered at the Jonathan Club
in the evening, with Dr. Swain, Al
mon Roth, Dink Templeton, and
Rothert as guests.
"Particularly noticeable," said Ro
thert, "were the unusually large
numbers that turned out for these
meetings. During the week, and
particularly on the eve of the game
last week, a new spirit that has
shown itself among alumni all fall
seemed to reach a peak."
Graduate Interest
Graduates have shown great in
terest in moving pictures of the
team in action, that have been
shown at most of the meetings. They
have stood behind the new coaching
staff from the start, and needless to
say are for Tiny and his red ma
chine more than ever after last Sat
urday's triumph. I feel that this
spirit among graduates will mean a
deal to every phase of campus
life."
