# FORUM DEBATE ROUSES FLOOR TO DISCUSSION
## Listeners Reach High Pitch Of Argument, Debators Look Surprised 
### Hal Von Breton 
Is the majority of Stanford men
I (plus the "800") pacifist: or did the
I majority of Student Forumites at
i last night's Cal-Farm debate repre-
I sent only Forumites, not Student
! Opinion? Time and Campus Opin
ions will probably tell. But any
! rate, Forum knows its mind.
Questions before' the somewhat
stormy meting: Resolved, That Uni
versity Students should pledge not
ito participate in future wars, car-
I ried two to one. Boom. I shall not
1 fight.
Audience Silent
Cal debaters for the question,
j Stanford speakers against it, seem
| ingly proved more that they were
! debaters than pacifists or nation-
I defenders. The burden of argument
rested with the floor. At first ques
| tions out of the audience were
j missing.
Fullenwider brought a man to his
i feet during the third speech, and
j after this opening break the ques
! tions came thick and fast, speakers
| rocked uneasily upon their feet. Ful
! lon wider was forced to intervene in
| each case.
Speakers Stunned
Came the conclusion of the de
! bater's talk, with Jim Minor, last
I Stanford man, obviously in distress,
. the previous Cal man still mopping
j his surprised brow. The floor stirred
I uneasily, the mob moved to its feet-
Chairman Fullenwider turned
; hither and yon, sorting out, select
, ing eager, speech-willing applicants,
j The floor turned on the debaters
j first, grilling them where they stood
1 on the platform.
Ten at Once
A timely suggestion by a Forumite
deleted the questions, talks of four
Jor five minutes became the rage,
| ten voices rising in their convinced
I wrath. Fullenwider harder pressed
j than ever.
j Debate on the floor centered
around "preparedness until security
■ is attained," point of view of Com
| mander Bryant, compus Internation
| alist, and pure pacificism as ex
i pounded by an unknown student
i hero.
Vote for Pacificism
So back and forth till Controller
Fullenwider called time, presented
! Mellinkoff and Masterson, Stanford
I and Cal summarists, who with fire
I and bombast refuted rival points
1 capped their cases and sat down.
The vote, confined to registered stu
! dents, as an auditor emphasized,
jwas on the conviction of the voters,
j who may and may not have been
i swayed by talk. Two to one that we
j shall pledge, shall nol fight was the
| outcome, but who is to circulate the
pledge?

stormy meting: Resolved, That Uni
versity Students should pledge not
ito participate in future wars, car-
I ried two to one. Boom. I shall not
1 fight.
Audience Silent
Cal debaters for the question,
j Stanford speakers against it, seem
| ingly proved more that they were
! debaters than pacifists or nation-
I defenders. The burden of argument
rested with the floor. At first ques
| tions out of the audience were
j missing.
Fullenwider brought a man to his
i feet during the third speech, and
j after this opening break the ques
! tions came thick and fast, speakers
| rocked uneasily upon their feet. Ful
! lon wider was forced to intervene in
| each case.
Speakers Stunned
Came the conclusion of the de
! bater's talk, with Jim Minor, last
I Stanford man, obviously in distress,
. the previous Cal man still mopping
j his surprised brow. The floor stirred
I uneasily, the mob moved to its feet-
Chairman Fullenwider turned
; hither and yon, sorting out, select
, ing eager, speech-willing applicants,
j The floor turned on the debaters
j first, grilling them where they stood
1 on the platform.
Ten at Once
A timely suggestion by a Forumite
deleted the questions, talks of four
Jor five minutes became the rage,
| ten voices rising in their convinced
I wrath. Fullenwider harder pressed
j than ever.
j Debate on the floor centered
around "preparedness until security
■ is attained," point of view of Com
| mander Bryant, compus Internation
| alist, and pure pacificism as ex
i pounded by an unknown student
i hero.
Vote for Pacificism
So back and forth till Controller
Fullenwider called time, presented
! Mellinkoff and Masterson, Stanford
I and Cal summarists, who with fire
I and bombast refuted rival points
1 capped their cases and sat down.
The vote, confined to registered stu
! dents, as an auditor emphasized,
jwas on the conviction of the voters,
j who may and may not have been
i swayed by talk. Two to one that we
j shall pledge, shall nol fight was the
| outcome, but who is to circulate the
pledge?
Is the majority of Stanford men
I (plus the "800") pacifist: or did the
I majority of Student Forumites at
i last night's Cal-Farm debate repre-
I sent only Forumites, not Student
! Opinion? Time and Campus Opin
ions will probably tell. But any
! rate, Forum knows its mind.
Questions before' the somewhat
stormy meting: Resolved, That Uni
versity Students should pledge not
ito participate in future wars, car-
I ried two to one. Boom. I shall not
1 fight.
