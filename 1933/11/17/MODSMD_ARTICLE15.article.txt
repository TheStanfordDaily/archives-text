; The crucifix may be barred from
( German churches, says an Asso
! ciated Press dispatch from Berlin
' printed in Washington.
"Everything that sprang from an
; alien spirit must be removed from
j the German people's church, be it
! ever so old and apparently vener-
I able," declared Dr. Reinhold Krause,
! chief of the Berlin section of the
| Nazi German Christians.
i He also ordained that pious Ger
mans should not visit the Holy
| Land, but rather places of religious
memory in Germany itself. The Old
Testament will also be barred from
j use in the German church," he said.
