# 'DAILY' SUPERMEN TO TAKE CHAPPIES
## 
### Tinkle Molehill 
Coach, "Daily" Super-Team
(Exclusive to the "Daily")
While swirling rain clouds painted
a gloomy picture on the football
front, I sent my boys through their
final workout. Machine - gunned,
bearded, uniformed spies stood
watch outside the somber high wall
i which prevents the eyes of oppo
nents from discerning "Daily" for
| mations.
Secrecy Today
But secrecy has not been our
password until today. Hitherto the
] gates to the practice field have been
; thrown wide—we have wanted to
give the team back to the "Daily"
reporters, so we have held Tuesday
1 workout rallies. We want all try
j outees, and even copy editors, to get
acquainted with our fine set of boys.
The greatest factor in today's
game will be psychology. Our main
task is to work on the Chappie sub
' conscious; if we can make an im
pression on the depressed mental
areas of that quadruple - threat,
j Howard Thurston Witherspoon of
j Chaparral, we have little to fear
' from opponent's scoring, for our
massive, broad - shouldered, good
natured, excellent academic paragon
i Josh Winston is a genuinely veri
table DEMON ON DEFENSE.
Fear Reverse
We fear above all Chappie's fa
mous nine-man reverse: every man
carries the ball but the two tackles,
and they get a crack at it on other
plays. This play, "Ordway 6676,"
j is a traditional classic of the grid
iron sport; it stirs wild-eyed root-
I ers to cheering abandon when they
\ witness the play, while the blush
i ing shadows from the foothill creep
over the last goal line, just before
j the ring of the fourth-quarter gun
barks in the ears of the tired, be
draggled players.
One more factor must be consid
ered: the psychological advantage
I which a better organized Rally
Committee will give our team. If
! the boys yell, if the reporters get
acquainted with the team, if the
card stunts go, if the rooters don't
scalp their tickets, if . . .
Then, ladies and gentlemen, you
and you and you—the vast multi
-1 tude that makes this great gridiron
sport the soul-stirring thing it is—
i will not be disappointed. For I have
no hesitation in predicting that the
final score will be:
Daily 11
Chaparral 2
And new since only thirty hours
remain before game time, I must
go to bed, and get the psychological
advantage over the Chappie coach
of a long, long sleep.
The lineup:
Members of the Stanford Daily
Jackals will assemble for final prac
tice session today at 3 o'clock in
the Stadium. The probable lineup
will be:
Ends — B (No Period) Kellogg,
Slan (Rough and Rah) Beaubaire.
Tackles—Truman R. (Grind 'em
Up) Letts, Rolph (Up and Grind
'cm) Malloch.
Guards — Charles (Flapper - foot)
Chappell, Jack (Fireworks) New
man.
Center—Francis (White Flame of
Encina) Hamilton.
Quarterback — Jay (Sideburns)
Graves.
Halfbacks — Albert (Honey Boy)
Guerard and Millard (I'll Fox 'em)
Browne.
Fullback — Johnny (Can't Busi
'cm) Kline.
It is rumored that Abe (B.A.C.
"Kid") Mellinkoff may be able to
hobble out to practice. If so, the
Gloomy Warrior may enter the
line-up, replacing Graves at quar
ter. All other male members of the
"Daily" staff are asked to report to
the coach's bench at the stadium.

ered: the psychological advantage
I which a better organized Rally
Committee will give our team. If
! the boys yell, if the reporters get
acquainted with the team, if the
card stunts go, if the rooters don't
scalp their tickets, if . . .
Then, ladies and gentlemen, you
and you and you—the vast multi
-1 tude that makes this great gridiron
sport the soul-stirring thing it is—
i will not be disappointed. For I have
no hesitation in predicting that the
final score will be:
Daily 11
Chaparral 2
And new since only thirty hours
remain before game time, I must
go to bed, and get the psychological
advantage over the Chappie coach
of a long, long sleep.
The lineup:
Members of the Stanford Daily
Jackals will assemble for final prac
tice session today at 3 o'clock in
the Stadium. The probable lineup
will be:
Ends — B (No Period) Kellogg,
Slan (Rough and Rah) Beaubaire.
Tackles—Truman R. (Grind 'em
Up) Letts, Rolph (Up and Grind
'cm) Malloch.
Guards — Charles (Flapper - foot)
Chappell, Jack (Fireworks) New
man.
Center—Francis (White Flame of
Encina) Hamilton.
Quarterback — Jay (Sideburns)
Graves.
Halfbacks — Albert (Honey Boy)
Guerard and Millard (I'll Fox 'em)
Browne.
Fullback — Johnny (Can't Busi
'cm) Kline.
It is rumored that Abe (B.A.C.
"Kid") Mellinkoff may be able to
hobble out to practice. If so, the
Gloomy Warrior may enter the
line-up, replacing Graves at quar
ter. All other male members of the
"Daily" staff are asked to report to
the coach's bench at the stadium.

While swirling rain clouds painted
a gloomy picture on the football
front, I sent my boys through their
final workout. Machine - gunned,
bearded, uniformed spies stood
watch outside the somber high wall
i which prevents the eyes of oppo
nents from discerning "Daily" for
| mations.
Secrecy Today
But secrecy has not been our
password until today. Hitherto the
] gates to the practice field have been
; thrown wide—we have wanted to
give the team back to the "Daily"
reporters, so we have held Tuesday
1 workout rallies. We want all try
j outees, and even copy editors, to get
acquainted with our fine set of boys.
The greatest factor in today's
game will be psychology. Our main
task is to work on the Chappie sub
' conscious; if we can make an im
pression on the depressed mental
areas of that quadruple - threat,
j Howard Thurston Witherspoon of
j Chaparral, we have little to fear
' from opponent's scoring, for our
massive, broad - shouldered, good
natured, excellent academic paragon
i Josh Winston is a genuinely veri
table DEMON ON DEFENSE.
Fear Reverse
We fear above all Chappie's fa
mous nine-man reverse: every man
carries the ball but the two tackles,
and they get a crack at it on other
plays. This play, "Ordway 6676,"
j is a traditional classic of the grid
iron sport; it stirs wild-eyed root-
I ers to cheering abandon when they
\ witness the play, while the blush
i ing shadows from the foothill creep
over the last goal line, just before
j the ring of the fourth-quarter gun
barks in the ears of the tired, be
draggled players.
