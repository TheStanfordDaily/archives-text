# 'DAILY' SUPERMEN TO TAKE CHAPPIES
## 
### Tinkle Molehill 
Coach, "Daily" Super-Team
(Exclusive to the "Daily")
While swirling rain clouds painted
a gloomy picture on the football
front, I sent my boys through their
final workout. Machine - gunned,
bearded, uniformed spies stood
watch outside the somber high wall
i which prevents the eyes of oppo
nents from discerning "Daily" for

Secrecy Today
But secrecy has not been our
password until today. Hitherto the
] gates to the practice field have been
; thrown wide—we have wanted to
give the team back to the "Daily"

i ing shadows from the foothill creep
over the last goal line, just before
j the ring of the fourth-quarter gun
barks in the ears of the tired, be
draggled players.
One more factor must be consid
ered: the psychological advantage
I which a better organized Rally
Committee will give our team. If
! the boys yell, if the reporters get
acquainted with the team, if the
card stunts go, if the rooters don't
scalp their tickets, if . . .
Then, ladies and gentlemen, you
and you and you—the vast multi

sport the soul-stirring thing it is—
i will not be disappointed. For I have
