# CARD REGULARS TO START TILT WITH MONTANA
## Bob Grayson Only Casualty As Indians Prepare For Grizzlies 
### Spud Hamilton 
Twenty-seven Montana Grizzlies
will hustle into Palo Alto this morn
ing, fresh from the cold winds of ;
Missoula, and immediately get ac
j climated for their game with Stan- ,
lord here at 2 o'clock tomorrow.
From 2 until 3 o'clock today the
Montanans will be getting up a
sweat in the Stadium, behind closed
gates.
Coach Tiny Thornilill is taking
no chances with a possible upset,
after his brilliant raiding of the
Trojan stronghold, and will start |
his best available team. This
means Bob Maentz at left half,
Jack Hillman at fullback, Frank
â–  Alusti/a at quarter, and Boh
Hamilton at right half.
In the line, he will have his usual
arrangement, with Jim Moscrip and
A1 Norgard at ends; Bob Reynolds
and Cab Callaway at tackles; Bob |
0 Connor and Bill Corbus, guards;'
and Bill Bates, center.
Montana's Record
The team from Montana has none
too savory a record; it has beaten 1
Gonzaga 13-6, but Mike Pecaro- 1
vich s lads have the somewhat
doubtful honor of dropping every i
contest thus far. The Montana team
appears to be running Gonzaga a 1
tight race in this respcct. Here is !
their case history:
Montana 0, Oregon State 20
Montana 7, Washington State 13
Montana 32. Montana State 0
Montana 7. Idaho 12
Montana 13. Gonzaga 6
The figures make Montana look
j like a bunch of tramps, as far as
, footballing goes, but need we re
! mind you that figures often lie, es
| pecially in horse races and foot- j
i ball games?
Visitors Small
The Montana squad is small in j
j numbers and in size, with the larg
| est men being Leonard Kuka and
| Lin Reynolds, a pair of 200-pound !
j tackles; down to Ben Bergman, a
| back who tips the scales at 129
j (count 'em).
They have a couple of real threats, '
however, in Bob Stansberry, triple
threat left half, and Henry Blastic, a
fleet sophomore ace. The starting
hackfield will probably be Stans- |
berry and Bill Hileman at halfbacks,
Cal Emery at quarter, and Leland
| Story at fullback.
Stanford has undergone a rigorous
j signal drill all week, evidently pre
. pared to take the Montanans in
stride if such is possible. California
! 'ooms big, one week from tomorrow.
Mosrrip. Hamilton Ready
j Jim Moscrip and Bob Hamilton,
the sophomore pair that were in the
' hospital Wednesday, were both on
! deck yesterday and booming with
| plenty of speed. The real boomer,
! Bob Grayson, was still hors de com- :
bat, certain not to play tomorrow.
Some of the second and third'
| string line men who have been rust
ing quiescently on the benches are
| bound to swing into action. Ted
j Kite and Bruce Tarver. guards; Lyle
Smith, Alex Trompas, Keith Top
! ping and Dave Packard, ends; Jack
1 Drown and Hack Holwerda, tackles.
; Ben Palamountain has not played
j since his injury against Santa Clara,
j and is likely to do some work
I against the conference cellar resi
i dents.
