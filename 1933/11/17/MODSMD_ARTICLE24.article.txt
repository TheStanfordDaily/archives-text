# Farm Women Beautiful, Men Don't Count--Doherty
## 
### FRANCES AYRES 
Stanford women are beautiful! j
"So what and says who?" the j
other 2f)io members of the student
population will probably ask.
Responsible for the statement is
Quad photographer J. H. Doherty,
i who ought to lie quite an authority ■
I on the "800 V' pulchritude, having!
already met the majority of them !
| through the medium of his never
-1 lying camera.
Notices Change
Photographer Doherty hasn't, been
| at Stanford since 1928 when he last
look pictures for the Quad, and
i shows interest in the change in the
' women.
"Then," says he, "Stanford women ,
; were considered studious but not so
good looking. Now they arc very
beautiful and intelligent." He smiled,
} apparently favoring the improve-1
I mont.
Other results of the march of
I time during the past four years I

! am »ng Stanford women is loss snob
bishness, the omission of fancy
make-up, and a tendency toward
simplicity in dressing. All of which
meets with a photographer's ap
proval.
"Make-up is detrimental tn a good
, picture," said Doherty. "Five years
i ago there were more peroxide
! blondes at Stanford than there are
today. Most of the girls seem to let
i their hair stay the color it is natu-
I rally."
Men Not Noticeable
The Quad photographer couldn't
say whether or not Stanford men
have changed for better or worse,
because, said he. "They don't count.
, No one ever notices boys."
Men and women are equally vain
before the camera, Doherty be
lieves, although the former try to
hide it.
"It's a human trait," he philoso
phized. "We all want to look nice
1 in our pictures,"
