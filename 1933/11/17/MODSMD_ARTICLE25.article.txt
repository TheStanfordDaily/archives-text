# New Four- Unit Dorm Will House Women Entering Next Fall
## "We Are Experimenting Now, ' Says Dean Yost. "New Dormitory Will Not Affect Sorority Housing"; Campus Prepare for 1,000 Women UPPERCLASSMEN ONLY TO LIVE IN NEW HALL New Living Group to Be Built North of Roble; Will Centralize Women's Quarters in 1934 
### ELEANOR CARLETON 
With plans released last night for the construction of a new four-unit
dormitory to house 200 additional women, fall quarter, 1934, will find
Stanford prepared for an expected enrollment of approximately 1,000
women, which would bring the University's registration enrollment to
unprecedented total.
The new living group is to be built on ground south and west of the
womens gymnasium and north of Roble Hall. It will consist of four dis-

♦tinct units, each sheltering fifty
I women, and facing on a large central
court.
Two Dining Halls
; All resident of the units together
will use the (wo dining halls in the
group, but variety in treatment of
' decoration and furnishing will be
accentuated in order to make each
unit as individual as possible. Ar
thur Brown and John Bakewell, who
executed plans for the women's
gymnasium, are the architects.
That the approximately six-four
I ratio of men to women, declared in
order by the startling decision of the
i Board of Trustees last spring is
likely to be attained in the compara
tively near future seems indicated
| by the expected feminine influx next
year.

''With the increased enrollment of
women this fall, it js reasonable to
i expect." stated Dean Yost laSt night,
! "that there will be a decided in
crease next year. We are delighted
with the prospect of a new dormi
tory, and believe it will be an asset
to all women, not only to those who
I live in it."
''We arc genuinely experimenting
! this year," Dean Yost continued,
"with different types of living groups
than we have over hyd before. We
have variety in our social organiza
' tiort, and our plans for the future
j are not definitely crystallized as yet.

"As far as I can see, the new

housing, but it will make it possible
to give an increased number of
women the benefiits of residental
units, a plan which Stanford has
I found to have great educational
value."
In line with the University's policy
