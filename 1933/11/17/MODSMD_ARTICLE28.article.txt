# Stanford on the Air

### 
The fact lliiil Stanford's debate will) Cambridge Sat
urday is Hie first transcontinental, transoceanic debate is
stupendous. The stupendosity of the alTair has swept peo
ple into an expected state of awe. Everyone litters and
gasps at Hie voices of collegiate debaters being carried over
those tiny radio waves for thousands and thousands of
miles.
Hul the significance is infinitely greater than the geo
graphic span involved.
II is significant that Stanford was selected. It is soul
satisfying that out of the myriad of western colleges, the
Hritishers selected us. II is an orchid lo Stanford. II is
more than an orchid. II is a bed of orchids (i.e. if orchids
grow in beds).
Hul more than that, it is a tribute lo Stanford debating.
Stanford has not gone out after decisions; they have gone
out lo train speakers, thinkers too. They have deliberately
avoided the type of speaking that makes fine corn-plaster
salesmen and Chamber of Commerce pep-breeders.
Thev have trained gentlemen who can debate. They
have trained gentlemen who delight in cultured form as
well as intelligent substance.
The opportunity tomorrow is a reward. II must be a
satisfaction to Ihe men who have guided (not whipped into
shape) generations of Stanford public speakers.
