Sally Rand, I lie t»i rl "who took off her pants to win a
movie oo 111nic-twas accorded a genuine welcome on he
half of Sail Francisco by Mayor Angelo Rossi when she
set foot in the city Wednesday, we are told.
Now splendid of Mayor Rossi to welcome Miss Rand on
behalf of the city. How many free tickets did he get to
the theatre where she is to appear? Oh, no, please don't
get us wrong. The smiling successor to .limmie Rolph did
not sloop to free publicity for the theatre, Miss Rand, and
himself he merely went through his set routine of wel
coming a well-known person to San Francisco.
Miss Rand is well known, we grant. Rut so is Fddic Qui
noncs, San Francisco's Public Knemv No. i. Possibiv Miss
Rand, whose well-advertised thighs thrilled visitors to the
recently closed Chicago fair, is better known nationally.
Rut Quinoncs is a home-town boy, a resident of Sail Fran
cisco (at times). Wbv doesn't the Mayor greet him? May
be Kddie had better gel a new publicity agent or sign a
movie contract.
Of course, there is no implication that Sally (not of our
alley, unfortunately) is a criminal. Far from that, accord
ing to the pictures. Rut it does seem a queer commentary
on problem-ridden mayors who tind time from their com
plicated governmental issues to welcome Miss Rand.
Or, mavbo, Mavors too are human.
