### 
Last night tlie Palo Alto Times ottered its readers an
amusing little anecdote about a local patriot who was de
claiming ahout the Communist menace. The speaker advo
cated that adherents to that social philosophy he ridden
out of town on rails, and other things like that. Hut the
oratory was rudely and ruinously punctured when sud
denly a listener, thirsty for information, asked the speak
er, ".Just what is Communism, anyhow?" The Palo Alto
Times adds that the question was left unanswered.
We are practically shocked to find the Times adopt
such an unfriendly attitude toward patriots, and appear to
he so liberal as to think that political speakers should
know what they're talking ahout, even when they're attack
ing those awful bomb-throwers and babv-eaters, the Com
munists.
This is hardly the attitude we expected from the busi
ness-seeking Times. A few weeks ago it editorially im
plied that Stanford students are a bit "wild." A town which
considers beer-drinking immoral wouid naturally regard
that as a much better editorial than one which gives the
razzberrv to patriots.
The Times must be slipping.
