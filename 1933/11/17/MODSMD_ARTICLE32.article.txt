## THE
						MAYOR OF HELL (Warner's) 
### 
| At the Varsity Theatre

This one starts out as a problem
| picture, dealing with suggested re
i forms in reformatories. James Cag
' ney portrays his usual "tough" role,
but this time he "goes straight" be
fore the last reel. Madge Evans does
a convincing bit as the idealistic
minded nurse. Frankie Darro, the
juvenile lead, makes a great deal of
| a difficult role.
After the brave beginning, the pic
ture goes melodramatic. The tyran
! nies of one man are portrayed in
I such a manner as to make of him
I (he stereotyped screen villain. And
' yet, if one remembers the school
| master in Dickens "Nicholas Nic- -
lulby," he will see that this one, at
least, of Hollywood's many ill-con
, cealed plagiarisms has a reputable
literary origin.
