# TO A GOD UNKNOWN,
## 
### John Steinbeck 
Ballou,

This third novel by John Stanford
I (Stanford, ex-'23) has bothered the
| critics, who have called it "slight"
land "powerful," "vague" and "inex
jorable," "obscene" and "beautiful." i
! They have compared its style and
i content to Thornton Wilder, D. H.
j Lawrence, and Robinson Jeffers.
(Some have embraced it; some have
j muttered and crossed themselves.
The book is mystical and at the
|same time coldly realistic. Although
I Joseph Wayne lacks humanity, he is
I strangely Christlike. The urge for
j sacrifice is inherent in all religions,
i and the god whom Joseph serves is
I the earth, with its fecundity and its
' heedlessness of men. As its priest, |
' increasingly obsessed with the aus
! terity of the life force, with its sym
bolism and its morality, he propi
tiates the rains with his blood, when
drought has devastated the fertile
California valley of himself and his
three brothers.
Steinbeck depicts life on a central I
California ranch with pungency and
fidelity, and creates characters that
are unforgettable. His sureness of j
touch and high seriousness preclude j
! the charges of pornography which
| might otherwise be brought against
j the story.
j "To a God Unknown" is a book
j that its readers will not easily for
i get. â€”Sheffield
