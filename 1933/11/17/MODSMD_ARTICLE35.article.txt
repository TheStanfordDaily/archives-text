# Y.W.C.A. ONE-ACTS WOMEN'S CLUBHOUSE
## 
### 
Wednesday marked the initial
| presentation of Y.W.C.A. dramatic
: efforts, two one-act comedies. Both,
! although presented by novices after
| few rehearsals, emerged entertain-
I ing and mirth-provoking.
Both opuses were brief, but well
i chosen. First on the program was
1 "That Blond Person," portraying the
j trials and tribulations of a devoted
| wife. Mary Louise Riley, in a bit
r.s the long-suffering laundress wife .
I of an inebriate, was outstanding.
Louise Harlan's "Eleanor" was
noticeably well cast; Lorraine Mia
no, Elizabeth and Frances Ferry, and
Benita Calmenson deserve praise in ,
I meager roles.
A demonstration of what may be
j accomplished by two dozen earnest
| songsters in only four short prac- )
j ticcs was seen in the glee club's
i vocal interlude. Presenting two
j widely varied numbers, the group
; did credit to the ability of its mem
i bers and the capable direction of

1 Mrs. A. L. Trowbridge.
Listed as the second dramatic ef
fort of the evening, "The Burglar"
proved popular with the audience.
Five superlatively frightened fe
males alone in a house, with a bur
glar reputed to be at large, will
always prove mirth-provoking, with
last night no exception to the rule.
Gertrude Blanchard's courageous
"Freda" contrasted well with the
extreme timidity of Barbara Pat
ton, Caroline Houseman, Carlita
Yates, and Pat Steadman.
To the list of worth - while
glimpses I add that scene in which
the five prepare to await the emer
gence of the burglar, pistol poised
j quaveringly.
The plays as a whole, although
showing inexperience and insuffi
cient rehearsal, succeeded remark
ably well in their effort to provide
an interval of light comedy to the
spectators, and a bit of experience
to the participants.
