The Editor, Sir:
For the past three years that I
have been off and on the campus,
and, I would judge, since about 1926,
; our southern neighbors, known and
referred to by most of u.s as those
| so-and-so Trojans, have taken
] somewhat of a verbal beating at the
hands of Stanfordites, both young
and old.
Now that they have takon a
trouncing in another way, we shall
in all probability condescend to let
these implicating jibes retire into
the dark corner while we sing our
theme song, "We Did It." We are
satisfied and new are content to let
1 such taunts as "subsidy," "ten bucks
j a yard," etc., lie in discard until
some future lime when our moral
, courage may need bucking up oncc
' more.
I think, however, that it is high
time to throw an orchid, and it
should be headed south to out
neighbors at U.S.C. 1 do not mean
that it should be given as an offer
: irg of sympathy or condolence, nor
would I recommend it as a com
pensative token to their wounded
pride, but rather an acknowledg
ment of the fine spirit of sportsman
ship exhibited by their rooting sec
tion at the game last Saturday.
Many of us on the field could not
help but notice it; they were real

hosts. They can "take it" just as
well as they can give it. and after
it was all over they were stfll smil
ing. It would seem to me, when I
think back upon some of the per
formances of our rooting section,
that we Stanfordites might make a
mental note or two for future ref
erence, just in case we should need
it someday.
