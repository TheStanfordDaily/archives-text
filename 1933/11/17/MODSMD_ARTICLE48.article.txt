# 'CRITERIA' CHOSEN AS TITLE OF NEW LITERARY REVIEW
## 
### Albert Guerard, Jr 
Creaking brains of "Daily"
writers slowed to normal inac
tivity yesterday, after almost a
month of frenzied effort. Out of
the whirl of inspired ideas and
conser v a t i v e objections has
emerged the name of the literary
supplement to the "Daily," which
will appear December 6.
The name of the review will be
"Stanford Criteria." This name in
dicates the nature of its editorial
policy, which shall be to avoid the
adoption of any hard-and-fast criti
cal tenets. In furthering this policy,
"Stanford Criteria" will arrange for
symposia which will present all
.sides of controversial problems. The
magazine will be more interested in
the theories of the cultural factors
which it examines than in the.tabu
lation of facts and data.
Deadline Monday
At the same time that the an
nouncement of the supplement's title
was made yesterday, it was reite
rated that the deadline for material
for the first issue is next Monday,
November 20. Material received
after that time, however, will be
considered for subsequent issues of
the review.
"Stanford Criteria" particularly
regrets that there has been a dearth
of fiction submitted, and that most
of the material received has been
from experienced writers. The pur
pose of the review is not only to
publish the best that is being writ
ten, but to develop hitherto unpub
lished talent.
Since no acceptable short stories
have as yet been received, this phase
of work offers a fin-j chance for new
writers.
Impartially Stressed i
Any suspicion thai "Stanford Cri- '
teria" might show partiality to cer- |
tain groups, and thereby become a :
mouthpiece for literary cliques, will
be dispelled by perusal of the first
issue's table of contents. A wide di
versity of material, coming from all
sources, has been arranged for. ;
"Stanford Criteria" considers it of,
primary importance that criticism be
divorced from any personal equa
tions.
Material should be' mailed to the
Editor, "Stanford Criteria," care
"Stanford Daily," or dropped in the \
mail slot of Room 204 a, English!
Building. If authors wish to have j
their manuscripts returned, they
must enclose stamps to cover post- i
age.

Creaking brains of "Daily"
writers slowed to normal inac
tivity yesterday, after almost a
month of frenzied effort. Out of
the whirl of inspired ideas and
conser v a t i v e objections has
emerged the name of the literary
supplement to the "Daily," which
will appear December 6.
The name of the review will be
"Stanford Criteria." This name in
dicates the nature of its editorial
policy, which shall be to avoid the
adoption of any hard-and-fast criti
cal tenets. In furthering this policy,
"Stanford Criteria" will arrange for
symposia which will present all
.sides of controversial problems. The
magazine will be more interested in
the theories of the cultural factors
which it examines than in the.tabu
lation of facts and data.
Deadline Monday
At the same time that the an
nouncement of the supplement's title
was made yesterday, it was reite
rated that the deadline for material
for the first issue is next Monday,
November 20. Material received
after that time, however, will be
considered for subsequent issues of
the review.
"Stanford Criteria" particularly
regrets that there has been a dearth
of fiction submitted, and that most
of the material received has been
from experienced writers. The pur
pose of the review is not only to
publish the best that is being writ
ten, but to develop hitherto unpub
lished talent.
Since no acceptable short stories
have as yet been received, this phase
of work offers a fin-j chance for new
writers.
Impartially Stressed i
Any suspicion thai "Stanford Cri- '
teria" might show partiality to cer- |
tain groups, and thereby become a :
mouthpiece for literary cliques, will
be dispelled by perusal of the first
issue's table of contents. A wide di
versity of material, coming from all
sources, has been arranged for. ;
"Stanford Criteria" considers it of,
primary importance that criticism be
divorced from any personal equa
tions.
Material should be' mailed to the
Editor, "Stanford Criteria," care
"Stanford Daily," or dropped in the \
mail slot of Room 204 a, English!
Building. If authors wish to have j
their manuscripts returned, they
must enclose stamps to cover post- i
age.
