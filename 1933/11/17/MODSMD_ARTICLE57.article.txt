# DESTRUCTIVE ROUGHS OF OLD DAYS GET TONED DOWN; PRESENT MALES PEACEFUL
## 
### FRANCES AYRES 
Stanford roughs of today are just |
a bunch of softies compared to the
virulent male specie that flourished
some 13 years ago on the campus.
In those days bewhiskered gentle
men managed to reek damage in
their weekly crashing of dances that !
would put the inoffensive tagging-in '
of the modern rough to shame.
Many Casualties
For example, one Saturday night
of Row and Hall dances, on Febru
ary 28, 1920, produced the following I
casualties the morning after, accord
ing to the Daily Palo Alto:
Alpha Omicron Pi house—roughs
broke the lock on the back door,
pilfered the kitchen, taking a con
siderable quantity of food, and broke !
into the Chinaman's quarters.
Pi Beta Phi house—lnflux of un- ■
invited roughs resulted in broken
dining room furniture and the
smashing of a punch bowl.
Alpha Tau Omega suffered the loss
of several pillows and had their |

house filled with an obnoxious
chemical that was thrown on the
floor.
At Roble, ever a rendezvous for
dateless roughs, screens were cut,
several windows broken, and $10
worth of chickens stolen from the
refrigerator.
Food Desires
The desire for food seems to have
motivated many of these playful lit
tle raids. During another dance at
Roble, roughs crashed the kitchen
rather than the dance floor to steal
18 dozen eggs and bring home most
of the coeds' cherished bacon.
The conduct of roughs in this pe
riod caused a campus-wide cam
paign to correct their manners with
the result that an unattached male
at today's party is content with lis
tening to the music and getting an
occasional tag-in.
Heavy knit fabrics are the newest
note for formals. *
