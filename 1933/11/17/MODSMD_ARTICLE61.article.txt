# Tedious Labors Resumed By Constitution Revisers
## 
### 
Struggling through the articles, |
clauses, and complications of that
mass of printed matter in the Frosh I,
Bible known as the A.S.S.U. Consti
tution, the Constitution Revision J
Committee held another three-hour
secret session last night in the Ex
Committee chamber.
Bogged down somewhere in the |
middle of the overlapping powers,
multitudinous amendments, and am
biguous phraseology of the Consti
tution, the committee will continue
with its ground-clearing work in
another secret meeting Monday.
Open meetings for students of or- ,
ganizations anxious to conserve 1
their constitutional rights will be!
held in the near future, with Chair- j
man A1 Denny and committee mem
bers Walter Bogart, Crompton j
Bangs, President Jerry Trautman,
and Jeanne Millard wielding the
pruning shears over conflicting j
powers.
