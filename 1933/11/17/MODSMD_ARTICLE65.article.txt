tion concerning Stanford delegates

pense particulars. The address of j
the general secretary. Kenneth May i
of U.C., is 1321 Bay View Place, j
Berkeley, California.
Students in Control
Every phase of the Institutes work
is controlled by students. An at- 1
tempt is made to have an equal rep- !
resentation of American and foreign ,
students, and to secure a wide va
riety of types of character, inter- j
ests, thought, and knowledge. The i
Student Institute was conceived and ■
founded in 1926 by college men and i
women for the purpose of promoting
better understanding among peoples
of the Pacific area. Each succeeding
year students have met during the j
Thanksgiving holidays to consider I
the economic, racial, cultural, and!
political adjustments which will de- 1
termine the direction of the newer I
and greater Pacific civilization. •>
Exchange of Ideas
The Conference aims to encourage i
exchange of ideas under ideal con- !
ditions. There is no lecturing, i
Informality is the keynote of the
discussion groups and the "bull ses
sions' represent the combined con
tributions of the group. From the
first it has been recognized that the
primary significance of the Institute j
lies not in the "accomplishment" of
anything definite nor yet in the body
of facts presented, but, rather in the !
enormous personal values of frank
discussion and comradeship among i
earnest students of widely varying
environment.
Sponsoring organizations may send
one official delegate. These will be j
given preference. Applications are !
then taken from students at large
until the quota for each campus i.l
- The size of the Conference I
is limited, since too great numbers !
would reduce its personal values.

Students in Control
Every phase of the Institutes work
is controlled by students. An at- 1
tempt is made to have an equal rep- !
resentation of American and foreign ,
students, and to secure a wide va
riety of types of character, inter- j
ests, thought, and knowledge. The i
Student Institute was conceived and ■
founded in 1926 by college men and i
women for the purpose of promoting
better understanding among peoples
of the Pacific area. Each succeeding
year students have met during the j
Thanksgiving holidays to consider I
the economic, racial, cultural, and!
political adjustments which will de- 1
termine the direction of the newer I
and greater Pacific civilization. •>
Exchange of Ideas
The Conference aims to encourage i
exchange of ideas under ideal con- !
ditions. There is no lecturing, i
Informality is the keynote of the
discussion groups and the "bull ses
sions' represent the combined con
tributions of the group. From the
first it has been recognized that the
primary significance of the Institute j
lies not in the "accomplishment" of
anything definite nor yet in the body
of facts presented, but, rather in the !
enormous personal values of frank
discussion and comradeship among i
earnest students of widely varying
environment.
Sponsoring organizations may send
one official delegate. These will be j
given preference. Applications are !
then taken from students at large
until the quota for each campus i.l
- The size of the Conference I
is limited, since too great numbers !
would reduce its personal values.
Bull Sessions creeping far into the
winter nights, touching on the af
fairs of Pacific civilization, will be
the core of the Eighth Annual Stu
dent Institute of Pacific Relations, !
scheduled for November 30 in the j
Santa Cruz mountains. Following
Thanksgiving dinner at 6:30 o'clock,
at Prescott's Inn near Soquel, four j
miles south of Santa Cruz proper, i
delegates will convene for the first j
sessions. Stanford student Cromp
ton Bangs holds the post of vice
chairman of the Institute, and is the
local campus chairman. The coun
cil is to meet till Sunday morning,
December 3.
