# MICHIGAN FAVORED TO COP FOURTH BIG TEN TITLE; FACES MINNESOTA SATURDAY
## Sports Editor, The Daily Northwestern 
### LESTER PONDER 
With but two hurdles remaining
in Michigan's path, the Wolverines
stand out as the favorites to cop the
Big Ten title again for the fourth
consecutive year. Michigan con
quered lowa, 10 to 6, last Saturday
in a hard-fought game and now
only Minnesota and Northwestern
remain in the path of the boys from
Ann Arbor.
Two great interconference games
dominate the Big Ten card this
weekend. They bring together Mich
igan and Minnesota, always great
rivals, and Purdue and lowa, two
other closely matched teams. Michi
gan and Minnesota should make the
fur fly at Ann Arbor, because nei
ther team has lost a game this sea
son, although the Gophers have
been tied three times. The "Little
Brown Jug," emblem of Wolverine-
Gopher superiority, will be at stake
in this game.
Purdue-lowa
The Purdue - lowa tussle should
bring out some of the best football
of the day. Purdue is undefeated
this season, with only a 7-7 tie
marring the record of the Boiler
makers; their convincing 19-0 vic

lowa has a great team this season
with only one defeat charged against
their record, the loss to Minnesota.
In other conference games Satur
day Chicago will travel to Cham
paign to meet Illinois while Ohio
State will play Wisconsin at Madi
son. Illinois appears to be too strong'
for the Maroons, with the Illini ae- j
rial attack, engineered by Jack Bey- |
non, likely to be the deciding factor. |
Ohio State Favored
Ohio State should take the Badg- i
ers, although the Wisconsin victory
over West Virginia indicates that
Coach Spears has his boys back in
top shape. This game should be
quite a scrap, with one touch-down
as the margin of victory.
In other games involving confer
ence teams Northwestern will play j
host to Notre Dame and Indiana
will travel to Cincinnati to meet
Xavier University. The Wildcat- |
Irish encounter will bring together
two teams which have been disap
pointments to their supporters all
: season and the result is a tossup.

really powerful teams of the nation.
lowa has a great team this season
with only one defeat charged against
their record, the loss to Minnesota.
In other conference games Satur
day Chicago will travel to Cham
paign to meet Illinois while Ohio
State will play Wisconsin at Madi
son. Illinois appears to be too strong'
for the Maroons, with the Illini ae- j
rial attack, engineered by Jack Bey- |
non, likely to be the deciding factor. |

Ohio State should take the Badg- i
ers, although the Wisconsin victory
over West Virginia indicates that
Coach Spears has his boys back in
top shape. This game should be
quite a scrap, with one touch-down
as the margin of victory.
In other games involving confer
ence teams Northwestern will play j
host to Notre Dame and Indiana
will travel to Cincinnati to meet
Xavier University. The Wildcat- |
Irish encounter will bring together
two teams which have been disap
pointments to their supporters all
: season and the result is a tossup.
