The Stanford student branch of ;
A.1..E.E. were hosts last night to ;
members of the University of Cali- ,
fornia chapter at a demonstration in ;
the Harris J. Ryan Laboratory.
A 900,000-volt arc was effected be
tween gaps varying up to 12 feet. :
The value of the experiments lies
in determination of breakdown
characteristics of power transmis
sion insulators. On demonstration J
also were, various types of high- i
tension power transmission conduc
tors.
