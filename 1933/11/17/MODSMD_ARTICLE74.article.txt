# No More Class Roll Calls With New Semester at Cal
## 
### 
Compulsory class attendance is
being abolished at the University of
California with a new policy of
"more learning and less teaching."
Results of the new plan at Cal will
be reflected in the examination
papers, no provision, however, being
announced in case the system should
fail.
Both the Berkeley and Los An
geles Universities will be affected by
the ruling which will probably go
into effect with the new semester.
