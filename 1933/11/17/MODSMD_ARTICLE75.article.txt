# LOSTâ€”ONE FREAK RED-HAIRED LADY WITH FOUR LEGS
## 
### 
If anybody sees a lady with
long, reddish hair walking
around the campus on four
legs, you'll do Boh Jones and
his brethren of Delta Upsilon
a big favor by communicating
with them at once.
"Lady" is a red Irish Setter.
Ilis absence from familiar
haunts was noticed yesterday
noon. Some scout the theory
that "Lady" is despondent over
missing her master, Jones, who
lay ill in Palo Alto Hospital
yesterday with food poisoning.
Jones, who is a night editor
on the Daily, will recover, but
friends predict his return to
good health will be materially
speeded if the missing hound
is located.
