# BIG GAME BANQUET PLANS CARRIED ON BY ALUMNI GROUP
## Fairmont Hotel to Be Scene Of Dinner Dance 
### 
Stanford's Alumni Association, ov
erjoyed and proud of its "come
through" footballers, is busy plan
ning and providing for their dinner
dance Big Game night, to be held
atop Nob Hill in the swank Fair
mont hostelry in the big town up
north. Biggest drawing card at this
writing looks like the menu, con
ceived by some of the leaders in the
city chef industry. To wit:
Crab en Bellcvue Sauce Muscovite
Ripe Olives—Salted Nuts
Essence Madrilene, Parmesan
Cheese Straws
Filet of Halibut, Sauce Gourmets—
Rissolee Nauta
Boneless Chicken Strasbourgeoise
Garden Peas au Beurre
Potato Gaufrelte
Biscuit Glace Surprise
Pet its Fours —Demi-tasse —Mint
Wafers
In case this ominous - sounding
barrage does not come through to
the entire satisfaction of the hard
palate, the Alumni can still offer
their ace - in - the - hole attraction,
nothing less than the conquerors of
Troy themselves, the Big Red Ma
chine who are to be present at the
affair dining and dancing with the
herd. Acting as ex officio chape
rons will be the coaching staff, in
cluding Tiny Thornhill, Ernie Nev
ers, and Jim Lawson.
Providing the necessary rhythm
for the evening's dance will be a
unit under Anson Weeks' name, al
ways reliable, and featuring vocal
selections and medleys of the Coast
college songs.
Table reservations are selling fast,
and are being sold at the Stanford
alumni office in the Administration
Building—one and all may come, at
the rate of $5 per plate.
