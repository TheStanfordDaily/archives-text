# Red Cross Drive Nears $400 Total for Campus
## 
### 
Nearing the $400 goal, Chairman
Elinor Kahn of the Red Cross Drive
asks further contributions, member
ships, to realize the total before the
Thanksgiving deadline. Living
groups are being canvassed under
the direction of sub-chairmen, who
report donations forthcoming, but
small.
Claiming greater need, heads urge
larger and more frequent contribu
tions to the undoubtedly worthy
cause. Stanford, not directly affect
ed by the Ped Cross, is relieved of
other relief work through their an
nual subscription.
Since Saturday, initial day of the
drive, donations have almost reached
expected sums, but two-dollar mem
berships lag.
