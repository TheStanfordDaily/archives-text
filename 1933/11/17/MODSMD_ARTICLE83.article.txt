# Minnesota Like Stanford Travels to Imbibe Spirits
## 
### 
Minnesota University has a prob
lem vaguely familiar to that of
bone-dry Stanfordites. Because of
a clause in the state constitution,
students have to travel a mile for
hard liquor. University officials
declared that, with repeal no longer
a dream, it was uncertain whether
beer, formerly sold on the campus,
would come under the clasification
of intoxicating beverage and so be
prohibited. "Our experience with
advent of 3.2 indicates that drinking
of hard liquors has derceased
among the students," Dean Nichol
son said.

There is an industry called boot
legging in the United Statesâ€”George
Bernard Shaw.
