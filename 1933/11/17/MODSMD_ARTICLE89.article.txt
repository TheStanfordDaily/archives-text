# BRITISH BROADCASTING COMPANIES. N.B.C. SPONSOR EXPENSIVE COLLEGIATE DEBATE
## 
### ANNALEE WHITMORE 
As the principal figures in to- I
morrow's transoceanic radio debate
with Cambridge, Dick Van Wagencn
and Bill Rogers bear the responsi- <
bility of one of the most expensive
broadcasts possible to make, to- 1
gether with an audience in Europe
as well as throughout the United '
States.
Inhabitants of England and France
are well-informed about the two ,
students. The who, what, when,
why, and where of their college ex
istence has been disseminated in
these and other European countries.
Cost Is Great
Cost, unusually large, is footed by
NBC and British Broadcasting Cor
porations, reaching the impressive
total of $I,OCO for the half hour of
oceanic broadcast, wnh national net
work rates even higher.
Last-minme deiails and a final
brief microphone practice will be
gained in a visit to the nineteenth j
floor studio of a San Francisco
building immediately preceding the
program.
This verbal encounter is distin
guished by being but the third

transcontinental or transoceanic ra
dio debate in recent history, its fore
runners being a Harvard-Oxford
contest last year, with Stanford op
posing Harvard in 1931, Howard
Conn and John Huneke represent
ing the local institution.
Ambassador Gerard chairmaneii
the former, which included the pres
ident of the Oxfoi'd Union as well
as its librarian as representatives of
the British aggregation.
Tomorrow's debate differs radi
cally from its predescessors in that
it is to have no rebuttals, with the
result that each team's second
speaker, Van Wagenen for Stanford,
hold the responsibility of including
a rebuttal in their speech.
Difficult F6at
This difficult feat will be achieved,
says Van Wagenen, by antic ipating
possible arguments of the opposition
before the actual broadcast, and
| shuffling cards containing appro
priate retorts during the debate.
The broadcast must tie timed to
the fraction of a minute. Thirty sec
onds are required to throw the
switches every time a reversal of

speakers is made, necessitating a
pau.se during that interval.
Entire speeches tue to be printed
in the Debaters' Annual, as were
those of the previous meets.
Stanford representatives tomorrow
take part in the only really inter
national debate in history, as the fa
mous Harvard-Oxford match, al
though having three men on either
side of the ocean, was presented by
split team, members of each nation
011 each side of the Pacific.
