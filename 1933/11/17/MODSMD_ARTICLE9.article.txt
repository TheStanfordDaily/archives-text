# Dance Planned After Gaieties
## 
### 
Big Game Gaieties will not be !he
only entertainment on the campus
next Friday evening. Immediately
following the performance, a special
all-University dance will be held in
the Women's Gym, from 11 to 1 a.m.
Those who- plan to attend the 1
dance after seeing the Gaieties are
in line for a distinct surprise. Dra
matic and Rally Committee heads
have collaborated, with final deci- '
sion to admit playgoers who pre
sent ticket stubs into the dance at
much-reduced rate;;.
However, all students may attend
the dance, even if they have not
seen Helvenston's fun-fest at the
Assembly Hall last night. Tariff for
them, however, will be higher.
Plans include a 10-piece orches
tra chosen from campus groups,
lighting and decorations in accord
ance with Big Game plans, and a
public address system in the gym.
Members of the committee in
charge of the after-Gaiety dance
are Art Kehke, Miriam Kropp, Bar
bara Holmes, Thornton Hinman, Ed
Saunders, A1 Synder, Charlotte Gib
ner, Gene Brown, and King Harris.
Julius Jacobs will head the com
mittee.
