## BACK FIELD ACE FUST LIKE KELLY 
### 
J

Montana University, who will be
going through the motions in Stan
ford Stadium tomorrow, is boasting
a fcackfield ace this year who re
minds the old-timers of Wild Bill
Kelly in his palmiest days. r lhe boy
is Henry Blastic, from Chicago, and
he played an important part in the
13-7 battle the Grizzlies played with
Washington State.
The Washington men won the
game all right, but Montana had
the ball on the three-yard line
when the gun sounded, and they
were driving hard for a score, lie
sides Blastic, who does most of
the ball carrying, there is Robert
Stansberry from Nebraska, a triple
threat man They have one of (he
smallest men in football iti Bennie
Bergeson, a 129-pound quarter,
who fires passes from the port
side. He is not a starter, hut may
see action later in the game.
Oscar, the office iconoclast, fer
vently hopes that no loose monkey
wrenches, etc., are handy when the
Big Red Machine gets warmed up
tomorrow. After the brilliant show
ing made last week, he allows it
would be too awful tragic if the
game turned out 1o be one of those
things. There have been worse up
sets; St. Mary's thought Pacific
would be picking a grape, but con
siderable fur flew before the last
cat was out.
