# SPUD HARDER'S FAREWELL TO ARMS
## 
### 
That 10-0 game with St. Mary's
must certainly have been a classic.
Spud Harder incurred nothing but a
double fracture of the jaw, concus
sion of the brain, hemorrhage of the
nose; his hemorrhage continued un
til midnight, and he regained con
sciousness four hours after that.
Larry Bettencourt, Kasperowicz,
Merrick, and O'Gorman of the Gaels
were all carried off the field.
It's always a treat to browse
through the old volumes. In 1923,
just 10 years ago, we find Ernie Nev
ers starting his first Big Game at
fullback, and "Tiny" Thornhill was
in his second year at Stanford, with
Andy Kerr as head coach.
And a little bit further back, a
cocky 140-pound towhead named
Dink Templeton we: ready to go
against California .it left half. Jack
Patrick was fullback for the Cards.
That was in 1921, and Stanford lost
the game 38-0. â€”Hamilton
