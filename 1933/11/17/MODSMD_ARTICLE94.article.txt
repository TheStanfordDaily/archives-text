# Card Soccer Squad Invades Cal With Title Hopes
## INDIAN TEAM MUST TAKE BEAR SCALPS FOR CHAMPIONSHIP Stanford Soccermen Clash With U.C. on Berkeley Field Tomorrow 
### Joe Lanidrac 
Invading the Berkeley soccer do
mains to fight the strong Bear soc
cermen on their own sloping battle
ground, the lately successful Indian
varsity travels, with only seven sub
stitutes, to U.C. tomorrow morning
with high hopes of placing itself in
line for a last-hour chance at the
Conference championship.
With the S.F.U. scalp hanging
on its belt and having once
scalped the periwigged California
men, the aggressive Stanford In
dian is going to make an angry
effort to take the periwig. This
will put the Indian in first place
in the league, from which posi
tion he will have an opportunity
to ambush the bewigged Don,
snatching away the big golden
wig which has adorned his head
for two years.
The entire first-string which
played against the S.F.U. pack will
leave the 'Stanford hunting ground
at 8:45 o'clock and will follow the
younger Braves of '37, who leave at
7 o'clock in the morning, up to the
Blue and Gold hunting lands. With
a good chance of winning, the var
sity will nevertheless have to play
its best to defeat the Bear team,
which it vanquished last time only
by the lone goal of Art Hearn, with
a good amount of luck, and with
clicking only during the last quar
ter.
The team will put its scoring faith
in the rejuvenated forward line
which took on a new appearance in
the S.F.U. tussle when Dong Ken
nedy, former varsity half who now
plays right inside, scored one of the
goals and played well. With Captain
CarJ. Knecht, the all-Conference left
wing who started the scoring .spree
against the Dons by a perfect cor
ner kick, Hsarn, Kennedy, Mike
Gcmez, and Sven Doddington all in
the offensive line-up, the Redme*i
have a potential scoring organiza
tion which will demolish the Cali
fornia defense in the Cards.
Same Halves
The halfback line which played
well in the last two Conference con
tests will remain the same to harass
the California defense and aid the
Stanford offense. Johnnie Moore,
Rudy Gonza'les, and Waddy White
will be the starting midfield team.
In the last trenches of the full
back and goal area Cy Johnson and
the boot-powerful brunette Adonis,
Dick Strouse, will be the fullbacks.
They held the wonderful Don of
fensive in great style and look good
to all-Conference judges. Goalie
Jack King, the head royalty of Con
ference goalguards, will be back in
the goalmouth he has so ably cared
for so far this season. His perfor
mance, if up to par, will discourage
Cal forwards and send their rally
tries afoul.
Those substitutes who will make
the trip are: forwards, Bud Krebbs,
Chuck Emerick; hall's, John Hitch
cock, Dave Dunning; fullbacks, Rod
Lewis, Pete Peck; goalie, Milt New
man.

the offensive line-up, the Redme*i
have a potential scoring organiza
tion which will demolish the Cali
fornia defense in the Cards.
Same Halves
The halfback line which played
well in the last two Conference con
tests will remain the same to harass
the California defense and aid the
Stanford offense. Johnnie Moore,
Rudy Gonza'les, and Waddy White
will be the starting midfield team.
In the last trenches of the full
back and goal area Cy Johnson and
the boot-powerful brunette Adonis,
Dick Strouse, will be the fullbacks.
They held the wonderful Don of
fensive in great style and look good
to all-Conference judges. Goalie
Jack King, the head royalty of Con
ference goalguards, will be back in
the goalmouth he has so ably cared
for so far this season. His perfor
mance, if up to par, will discourage
Cal forwards and send their rally
tries afoul.
Those substitutes who will make
the trip are: forwards, Bud Krebbs,
Chuck Emerick; hall's, John Hitch
cock, Dave Dunning; fullbacks, Rod
Lewis, Pete Peck; goalie, Milt New
man.
Invading the Berkeley soccer do
mains to fight the strong Bear soc
cermen on their own sloping battle
ground, the lately successful Indian
varsity travels, with only seven sub
stitutes, to U.C. tomorrow morning
with high hopes of placing itself in
line for a last-hour chance at the
Conference championship.
With the S.F.U. scalp hanging
on its belt and having once
scalped the periwigged California
men, the aggressive Stanford In
dian is going to make an angry
effort to take the periwig. This
will put the Indian in first place
in the league, from which posi
tion he will have an opportunity
to ambush the bewigged Don,
snatching away the big golden
wig which has adorned his head
for two years.
The entire first-string which
played against the S.F.U. pack will
leave the 'Stanford hunting ground
at 8:45 o'clock and will follow the
younger Braves of '37, who leave at
7 o'clock in the morning, up to the
Blue and Gold hunting lands. With
a good chance of winning, the var
sity will nevertheless have to play
its best to defeat the Bear team,
which it vanquished last time only
by the lone goal of Art Hearn, with
a good amount of luck, and with
clicking only during the last quar
ter.
The team will put its scoring faith
in the rejuvenated forward line
which took on a new appearance in
the S.F.U. tussle when Dong Ken
nedy, former varsity half who now
plays right inside, scored one of the
goals and played well. With Captain
CarJ. Knecht, the all-Conference left
wing who started the scoring .spree
against the Dons by a perfect cor
ner kick, Hsarn, Kennedy, Mike
Gcmez, and Sven Doddington all in
the offensive line-up, the Redme*i
have a potential scoring organiza
tion which will demolish the Cali
fornia defense in the Cards.
