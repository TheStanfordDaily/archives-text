## 
### 
By virtu of a 1-0 win over Lowell
High of San Francisco which in ]
turn trimmed the Cal Frosh, Coach
Hairy Moloney's Babe soccer eleven
will enter its big game tomorrow
morning a slight favorite over the
U.C. yearlings. Saturday's encoun
i ter, scheduled for 9 o'clock on the
Berkeley field, is the first of a se
ries of two games, the second to
precede the Big Game a week later.
During a final polishing-off prac
tice this afternoon, probably con
sisting mainly of a scrimmage
against the varsity, the Babes will
elect a captain to lead them through |
the U.C. games. Two wins, a tie,
and a loss sum up the yearling prac
tice season, closed two weeks ago
with a 2-1 victory over South San
Francisco High.
Pete Knecht in the forward wall,
Hall at half, and Washburn, full, |
have prdVed the frosh mainstays in [
the previous games and are due to
lead the Babe attack tomorrow. A
tentative stai'ting line-up for the :
Cards includes: Haliby, Knecht, Ev
ersole, Rowe, and Nightingale, for
wards; Metcalfe, Enke, and Hall,
halves; Washburn and Bullis, fvffl
-1 backs; and McClelland, goalie.
