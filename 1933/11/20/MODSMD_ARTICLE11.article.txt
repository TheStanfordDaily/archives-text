# Water Threatens Encina Dance; Desk, Walls Burn
## By IRVIN JORGENSEN 
### 
When li) 0 pounds of frosh football
tackle, Dan Van Dellcn, ambled out
of his third-floor Encina loom at
i 8:30 o'clock Friday night on his way
to take a shower in preparation for
Encina's Informal, he heard the
l sound of tearing paper, saw smoke
pouring out of the transom of the
room next door to his. Said he to
his companions, "Daily" business
workers, Jack Tracy and Bob Me
serve: "They must be having a fire
; in the fireplace down stairs."
A few moments later, Van Dellen,
Meserve, and Tracy had sounded the
alarm, manned a fire hose. The
alarm brought the? nightwatchman
' up from the first floor in nothing fiat.
The sound of glass breaking in
fire extinguisher cases from the
basement to the fifth, floor, brought
dance-preparing frosh in a mad
rush.
Fire llosc Used
Through the confusion, Van Del
len on the business end of the hose
had entered the room, put out the
blazing desk of freshman golfer
George Berkey, rescued his Big
Game tickets, the books of room
mates George Prince and Pete Jew
ett, all away at the time. Sponsors
had rushed to th" scene with fire
extinguishers, could not stand the
smoke, left the fire extinguishers

drizzling on the floor.
Out of the smoke-and-water-filled
room walked singed, unperturbed
Van Dellcn, to meet the wails of
sponsors and janitors, who saw the
water on the floor, worried lest it
leak down on the dance below, won
dered why he hadn't used the fire
extinguishers located at the other
end of the building.
Damage Small
Cause of the fire not definitely
established, roommates Prince, Jcw
ett, and Berkey thought that a cig
arette thrown in a waste-basket by
one of the crowd of bridge players
who had left the room with the
roommates 15 minutes before, might
be the cause. Defective wiring,
though less plausible, was also in
tonated.
Though damage was limited to the
destruction of the desk, burning of
part of the floor and wall and part
of Berkey's Citizenship notes, Uni
versity officials had worried looks
on their faces today.
If the fire had started a half an
hour later, when all Encina and
half of Ruble was downstairs at
the Informal, possibility of a ma
jor conflagration would not have
been impossible.
A fire hazard at any time, cig
arettes in Encina waste-baskets
are doubly dangerous.

basement to the fifth, floor, brought
dance-preparing frosh in a mad
rush.
Fire llosc Used
Through the confusion, Van Del
len on the business end of the hose
had entered the room, put out the
blazing desk of freshman golfer
George Berkey, rescued his Big
Game tickets, the books of room
mates George Prince and Pete Jew
ett, all away at the time. Sponsors
had rushed to th" scene with fire
extinguishers, could not stand the
smoke, left the fire extinguishers

drizzling on the floor.
Out of the smoke-and-water-filled
room walked singed, unperturbed
Van Dellcn, to meet the wails of
sponsors and janitors, who saw the
water on the floor, worried lest it
leak down on the dance below, won
dered why he hadn't used the fire
extinguishers located at the other
end of the building.
Damage Small
Cause of the fire not definitely
established, roommates Prince, Jcw
ett, and Berkey thought that a cig
arette thrown in a waste-basket by
one of the crowd of bridge players
who had left the room with the
roommates 15 minutes before, might
be the cause. Defective wiring,
though less plausible, was also in
tonated.
Though damage was limited to the
destruction of the desk, burning of
part of the floor and wall and part
of Berkey's Citizenship notes, Uni
versity officials had worried looks
on their faces today.
If the fire had started a half an
hour later, when all Encina and
half of Ruble was downstairs at
the Informal, possibility of a ma
jor conflagration would not have
been impossible.
A fire hazard at any time, cig
arettes in Encina waste-baskets
are doubly dangerous.
When li) 0 pounds of frosh football
tackle, Dan Van Dellcn, ambled out
of his third-floor Encina loom at
i 8:30 o'clock Friday night on his way
to take a shower in preparation for
Encina's Informal, he heard the
l sound of tearing paper, saw smoke
pouring out of the transom of the
room next door to his. Said he to
his companions, "Daily" business
workers, Jack Tracy and Bob Me
serve: "They must be having a fire
; in the fireplace down stairs."
A few moments later, Van Dellen,
Meserve, and Tracy had sounded the
alarm, manned a fire hose. The
alarm brought the? nightwatchman
' up from the first floor in nothing fiat.
The sound of glass breaking in
fire extinguisher cases from the
basement to the fifth, floor, brought
dance-preparing frosh in a mad
rush.
