# WIN IN CANADA, RADIO DUEL AID DEBATE RECORD
## Card Orators Clash With Two British Empire Forensic Teams 
### 
While Dick Van Wagenen and Bill
Rogers were exchanging verbal sal
lies with Cambridge over the ether
waves Saturday, Rollin Woodbury
and Bob Gfantier, Stanford's north
ern touring debaters, wei'e capturing
a 3-0 decision from the University
of British Columbia, according to a
telegram received from the two
wayfarers yesterday.

j Over the international hook-up,
'the steely common sense and legal
j mindedness of Rogers and Van
j Wagenen formed a unique contrast
i with the philosophical allusions,
J witty repartee, and typical English
| suavity of their Cambridge op
i ponents.
Wilbur Is Chairman
| Chairman Ray Lyman Wilbur took
j particular care to eliminate any pos
j sible propaganda movements of mis
interpretation by stating that the
' debate in no way represented any
i differences of national opinion as
j sides of the question were chosen
by lot.
I .Smashing into thy question, Re
| solved, that the salvation of the
world lies in democracy rather than
!in dictatorship; from an amusing
I and entirely unexpected angle, H. B.
| R. Cooke, opening speaker for Cam
! bridge, flaunted the words, "De
j mocracy has never been given a
| chance."
Rogers Uses Humor
It took a frenzy of card shuf
| fling before Van Wagenen could up
l root sufficient hard-shelled pragma
| tism in his files to offset the sar
j donic attack of the Englishmen.
Rogers opened the Cardinal at
tack by showing the utter failure of
j Democracy to function in time of
| crisis. He used concrete modern ex
j amples to prove his points rather
| than soaring into metaphysical strat
! osphere, and found occasion to re
j fleet some of his father's humor
l along the way. "When the French
I franc needed stabilizing in 1925, how
i did the French people act?" Rogers
| asked, and then went on to answer,
| "The people had one premier for
j breakfast, another for lunch, and a
j third for dinner.
| "Suppose Roosevelt had turned
| bank crisis over to the senate, Boy!
! We would be in it yet."
With these facts and fictions of
I both teams the vast radio audience
I was left to decide for itself whether
Ito relegate Democracy to limbo
I hoop-skirts and prohibition or pre-
I serve it as a criterion of national
patriotism and ideals.
