### 
EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the first of a series of articles, tracing tin
history of the Stanford Axe.

Stanford yelled "Give 'em the
Axe" for three years before there
was any axe to givo 'em. Written
by Will Irwin, ex-'9B, now famous
author, the yell symbolized the Car
dinal's far from brotherly attitude
toward California until events in
189!) precipitated a crisis in Farm
spirit.
Dink Templeton, MS, describes
the colorful first chapter in the
blade's history in a thin red vol
ume called "The Stanford Axe."
The Cardinals, it seemed, had en
joyed three years of consistent win
ning in sports contests with the
larger and much older U.C. The
sudden death of Stanford's star
pitcher, George Beckett, threatened
the '99 baseball season, and when
the Bears won the first game of the
series, defeat seemed certain.
Fearing such a disaster, and hop
ing to boost the team's morale, stu
dent leaders procured from some
where, a huge 10-pound broadaxe

in keeping will) the spirit of Irwin s
yell. Its presentation was a specta
cle never forgotten by Standfordites
of that generation.
A cheering student body, gyrated
around one of the biggest bonfires
in Farm history. The axe, bright
with its red Block S, was sharpened
by Yell Leader Billy Erb, while
Frank English, orator for the eve
ning, turned the wheel of the grind
stone. Then the crowning ceremony
—Erb capitated a blue and gold
dummy with one fell blow of the
keen blade. i 'Give 'em lhe Axe
look on a new meaning—a great tra
dition was born.
Three days later these same yell
ing students would have just a.-
willingly tossed their new tradition
into the bay. The axe didn't bring
them the expected good luck. Al
though Erb paraded it constantly
before the rooting section, Stanford
lost lhe ball game, 9 to 7.
