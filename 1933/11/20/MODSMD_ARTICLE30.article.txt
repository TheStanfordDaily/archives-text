# Recognizing Russia
## 
### 
The I'liilcd Slates now recognizes I lint, politically, Rus
sia exists. That fact is not nearly as astounding as the fact
that tor 1(> years we held stubbornly to the belief that they
did not exist. We maintained that no society could endure
without the profit motive; and then proved our own con
tention by refusing to recognize Russia.
It was very flattering to our logic to so hold. The only
(rouble was that those "Reds" didn't believe lis; and went
on existing just as if we had never said that tliey couldn't.
If was perfectly amazing, yet true. The result is that today
they have a government that is older than practically every
one in Kurope. The laugh is that if there had been no
depression they might have gone on for KM) years or more
without official recognition from the land of the free and
the home of the brave. Hut in a depression, everybody's
money looks very welcome, even Rolshevik money; and
so we finally recognized them.
This action by Roosevelt will no doubt be looked upon
as sheer insanity by perpetual flag-wavers. These groups
confuse recognition with approval. Recognition of Russia
does not mean approval of their system; no more than
recognition of (iermany implies our approval of Nazism.
We recognize France without endorsing frogs' legs; and
Italy without sanctioning the entangling cross-alliances of
spaghetti and tomato sauce.
The Russians it is said have abolished (Jod by vote of
the central ehimnit tec; and some D.A.R. members assume
that our recognition aids in the destruction of the Deity.
Personally, we feel that the Omnipotent can withstand the
votes of the central committee. And secondly, recognition
has nothing to do with religion but rather with the sale of
cotton and copper.
Further, it has also been held that Russia has nation
alized her women, deprived mothers of their children, and
made the home a boarding house. We look with dis
favor on all these things though Plato may have favored
them, and (hough the Russians have adopted none of them.
We approve of women, children, and the home. Hut the
tinted Stales recognized Russia because they will purchase
Baldwin locomotives, not because thev have or have not
nationalized their women.
(iermany has done worse than nationalize her women
(a t nited States high-school myth about Russia during the
"twenties). Hitler has forced them to remove their make
up, revealing the long-suspected truth to all men. Yet for
that dastardly deed, we should not break off diplomatic
relations now or in the future.
Legion Commander Hayes has accepted with good
grace the recognition; but reiterates his light to stop the
dissemination of Communism. Our belief in American in
stitutions is stronger than his, for we feel tliey are strong
enough to withstand the wildest rantings of soap, prune
(or any oilier kind of) box orator.
We would allow communists along with vegetarians,
nudists, spiritualists, and others who feel they have the
panacea for the world's ills to speak lo their larynx's con
tent. Ry suppressing them, we let them make martyrs out
of themselves. Nothing is worse than a martyr. They are
completely self-satisfied. The Daily looks with suspicion
and horror on complete self-satisfaction.
