# BULL SESSION
## WHEN EARTH'S LAST PICTURE IS PAINTED 
### 
Brooke Hart is dead.
He was not murdered by maniacs;
he was simply murdered for money.
The crime was not performed in the
heat of passion or in a moment of
rage. It was calm, reasoned, de
liberate murder.
The sign of the cross, or any other
symbol of ethical doctrine that
Holmes and Thurmond might once
have known were forgotten. The
Sign of the Dollar was in the as
cendancy.
Justice, if there can be such a
thing in such a case, must now take
its course. In the same manner in
which the injustice was committed:
in calmness, with careful calculation,
the court must now function. Not
in a spirit of vengeance should these
men be punished—else the .so-called
upper-world compromises itself with
the under. The unreasoning cries
of "Lynch them" and the reasoning
cries of soupy sentimentality must
be equally disregarded. Both are
barbaric. A civilized government
must be the governor on the inter
nal-external, eternally combusting
human machine.
The insanity plea has not yet en
tered the Hart case. Doubtless it
will soon raise its false-face, its sci
entific alibi. Alienists, usually ready
with obliging testimony on either
side of any case, may tap the
Holmes-Thurmond patella, and pro
nounce both men "temporarily in
sane." The mockery is a common
one.

But what if the men were indeed
deranged? Should that also derange
the machinery of justice? If insan
ity is to be an excuse rather than an
accusation, we may do well to cul
tivate "sweet insanty" as a virtue.
And perhaps it is considered such.
Society decrees careful treatment
for the "insane"; thousands of dol
lars to give food and shelter to the
! "insane" — thousands of "s an e"
: homes contemplating approaching
i winter and sadness and actual want.
That is justice!
Bull Session does not cold blood
edly ask for the lives of the con
fessed slayers. They should be dis
patched in the most painless, the
quickest fashion. We do not believe
society will be served the better by
the gallows than the lethal gas
i chamber*. In a sense, Holmes arid
Thurmond must be pitied—that they
• live in a society where money, not
accomplishment is the reigning idol.
But though they are, perhaps, the
victims of society, society must con
tinue; Holmes and Thurmond must
go. Sane or insanse, they have be
■ come a menace.
When earth's last picture is
painted for these two men, society
must begin to think in terms of
| basic causes, not in terms of re
surgent emotions. Brooke Hart is
not the last to go. There will be
many Brooke Hart.?, just as there
have been Lindbergh babies. The
' hangman's noose, now almost a
i necessity, is not the ultimate solu
! tion. —Dave Mellinkoff

But though they are, perhaps, the
victims of society, society must con
tinue; Holmes and Thurmond must
go. Sane or insanse, they have be
■ come a menace.
When earth's last picture is
painted for these two men, society
must begin to think in terms of
| basic causes, not in terms of re
surgent emotions. Brooke Hart is
not the last to go. There will be
many Brooke Hart.?, just as there

Brooke Hart is dead.
He was not murdered by maniacs;
he was simply murdered for money.
The crime was not performed in the
heat of passion or in a moment of
rage. It was calm, reasoned, de
liberate murder.
The sign of the cross, or any other
symbol of ethical doctrine that
Holmes and Thurmond might once
have known were forgotten. The
Sign of the Dollar was in the as
cendancy.
Justice, if there can be such a
thing in such a case, must now take
its course. In the same manner in
which the injustice was committed:
in calmness, with careful calculation,
the court must now function. Not
in a spirit of vengeance should these
men be punished—else the .so-called
upper-world compromises itself with
the under. The unreasoning cries
of "Lynch them" and the reasoning
cries of soupy sentimentality must
be equally disregarded. Both are
barbaric. A civilized government
must be the governor on the inter
nal-external, eternally combusting
human machine.
The insanity plea has not yet en
tered the Hart case. Doubtless it
will soon raise its false-face, its sci
entific alibi. Alienists, usually ready
with obliging testimony on either
side of any case, may tap the
Holmes-Thurmond patella, and pro
nounce both men "temporarily in
sane." The mockery is a common
one.

But what if the men were indeed
deranged? Should that also derange
the machinery of justice? If insan
ity is to be an excuse rather than an
accusation, we may do well to cul
tivate "sweet insanty" as a virtue.
And perhaps it is considered such.
Society decrees careful treatment
for the "insane"; thousands of dol
lars to give food and shelter to the
! "insane" — thousands of "s an e"
: homes contemplating approaching
i winter and sadness and actual want.
That is justice!
Bull Session does not cold blood
edly ask for the lives of the con
fessed slayers. They should be dis
patched in the most painless, the
quickest fashion. We do not believe
society will be served the better by
the gallows than the lethal gas
i chamber*. In a sense, Holmes arid
Thurmond must be pitied—that they
