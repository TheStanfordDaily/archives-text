PAKIS BOUND (Philip Barry)
At the Palo Alto Community Theatre
In "Paris Bound," Philip Barry
! finds ample opportunity for that
I trick of play writing which he loves
i so well: the earnest setting forth of
an idea almost amounting to a mo
| ral, and adorning it with pleasant
| iuid interesting characters who speak
! pleasant and clever lines. Since this
! is one of his earlier plays, the idea
j is a little more predominant over
the characters and their dialog than
I in the later "Holiday" or '"Animal
j Kingdom."
The play deals very frankly with
j marriage as a job for two people
I who must actually work to make
! a go of it, and sets forth the idea
I that neither person must be per
j turbed by momentary "infidelities"
I of the other, but that the husband
! may genuinely love his wife while
j seeming to care for "the other
' woman." It all seems perfectly sim
ple to Mary Hutton until she finds
I her husband has been momentarily
| unfaithful to her; but her emotions
, are still further complicated by the
| sudden realization that she too has
! been unfaithful. And after the pre-
Lsentation of such an idea, it is a
j pleasure to witness the relative
I painlessness of the play's denoue
i ment.
Most of the theorizing of the play
I fell to the character of James Hut
ton, Sr., and thus it is to be de
plored that the present production
was weak in that department. Wal
| tor H. Brown brought a modicum
\ of the charm to the part, but seemed
ill at ease, not only in his constant
shuffling of feet and futile gestures,
'but in an actual hesitancy with lines.
I The difficult role of Mary Hutton,
the wife, was given a studiously
earnest interpretation by Eleanor
Clark, whose first act was perhaps
the most effective. Miss Clark
evinced a nice understanding of
Mary Hutton, but sacrificed much
of that character's charm in striv
ing for the "idea" of the play.
As "thai attractive Shippan girl,"

j Dorothy Tully walked off with the
; show, in the opinion of this column,
i Her's was a minor part—a well
written one, to be sure — but she
| managed a delightfully spirited
I characterization which drew far
more laughs than probably even its
author would have expected.
Barry's male characters — like
those of Rachel Crothers—are rarely
as good as his women, and Jim Hut
ton is a difficult part. Anthony
Morse made him charming and sin
cere through a fine and .steady per
formance. His telephone conserva
tion with his son was a splendid
moment.
More successful with the dilet
| tante type of character, Barry herein
created Richard Punish and Peter
Copes. William Pabst gave a subtle
interpretation of the former, while

Alan Robertson was wholly engag
ing as Peter.
Frilzi-Beth Bowman made a sig- 1
nal impression in her brief but ex
tremely effective appearance as Noel
Farley. She s haded her work ,
nicely between restrain and emo
tion and quenched- any suspicion
that she might have been miscast.
Katrina Wallingford's Nora Copes i
was wholly charming, and Helen ;
Howe and Mabel Clark were ef
fective in minor roles.
Peg Converse, in her direction,
I captured the "idea" and the gaiety
of the Barry play, and was particu- j
larly pleasing in the rapid tempo of
j the first act. —Chapin j

j marriage as a job for two people
I who must actually work to make

I that neither person must be per
j turbed by momentary "infidelities"
I of the other, but that the husband
! may genuinely love his wife while
j seeming to care for "the other
' woman." It all seems perfectly sim
ple to Mary Hutton until she finds
I her husband has been momentarily
| unfaithful to her; but her emotions
, are still further complicated by the
| sudden realization that she too has
! been unfaithful. And after the pre-
Lsentation of such an idea, it is a

I painlessness of the play's denoue

Most of the theorizing of the play
I fell to the character of James Hut

ill at ease, not only in his constant
shuffling of feet and futile gestures,

I The difficult role of Mary Hutton,
the wife, was given a studiously
earnest interpretation by Eleanor
Clark, whose first act was perhaps
the most effective. Miss Clark
evinced a nice understanding of
Mary Hutton, but sacrificed much
of that character's charm in striv
ing for the "idea" of the play.
