# Tinkle Lapses, Relapses; Daily Wins, 6-6
## 
### Tinkle Molehill 
(Exclusively to the Stanford Daily)
A stark drama was going on dur- j
ing the Daily-Chaparral annual
' football classic Saturday afternoon, ,
while 120,000 spectators looked on
, with unworried minds, not realizing
! that the yellow-sweatered team was
battling the Chappie Firemen to a
6-6 tie at the same time that its
much-loved, gentleman coach, I,
, "Tinkle" Molehill, was dying in the
Press box.
I Am Stricken
Molehill was stricken just before
! the game, and missed the moment
he had been waiting for all his life
—the brilliantly executed touch
down shift play in which triple
threat Brown Millard Witherspoon
I smashed his way to a touchdown,
although both arms and both legs,
his nose, and seven of his ribs were
broken as a result of the mixup
: which occurred in the opening play
jof the gi.rne—the kickoff where he
was accidentally tackled by a mem-

ber of his own team.
The irony of football's reward was
; exhibited when Molehill emerged'
from his coma just in time to see:
; Chappie score its only legal touch-I
i down of the game. This score came |
in spite of dogged battling on the j
j part of the famous "Daily" pyramid
goal-line defense which was found
wanting only when Gauze Thomas
caved in at the bottom of the pyra
mid.
Thomas Is Lynched
After the game, the "Daily" sup
• porters, not knowing that Thomas
was handicapped by two smashed
[thighs, branded the gallant lineman
i as a quitter, and mobbed the Presi
! dent's office after the game, asking
| the executive to expel Thomas from
' school. Enraged at his refusal to |
comply with their requests, the
crowd lynched Thomas after the
game. Whottagame!!
