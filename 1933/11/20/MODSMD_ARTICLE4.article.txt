# Unrecognized Cuba
## 
### 
F.R. doesn't seem to be able to get
away from business. Cuban Envoy
Welles, fat briefcase under arm,
brought troubles to Warm Springs,
chatted with President, had dinner,
is now on way back to strife-torn
island. Rumors of his resignation
are thus temporarily squelched.
What most would like to know—
what the two talked about—is a deep
secret.
Meanwhile, Cuba's unrecognized
quasi-government has failed to draw
even a nod from fatherly, but deeply
concerned U.S. Sporadic street
scrambles continue, tourists are still
jittery.
