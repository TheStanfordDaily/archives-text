# Cat and Dog Wake Delt House, Play Together
## 
### 
All is harmony m the brown Delta
Tttu Delta house on the hill. Even
a cut and # dog get along together in
this unmilitaristic atmosphere. The
brothers proudly point to ''Butch,"
their four months old bulldog, and
"Puffy," ilie two months old kitten,
who sleep, eat, and play together.
These phenomenal animals share
the same basket and do their part
in fraternity life through waking up
sleeping Delts by licking their faces.
In the quiet of these long winter
evenings, "Puffy" kibitzes from the
top of the bridge table, while
"Butch" sits on the couch and keeps
an eye on the boys.
