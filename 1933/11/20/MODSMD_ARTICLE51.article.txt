## 
### GRAY CREVELING 
Showing the finest team-work of
the year, Stanford's varsity water
poloists outclassed (he Olympic Club
splashers, 11-5, Friday night at the
clubmen's tank.
The Indians ran up a score of
9-0 during the first half, and it
was Jimmy Triolo who scored six
of these goals to he high-point
man for the evening.
Coming out of the tank at half
time, Triolo resembled a disillu
sioned tiger. His left eye was black,
partly closed, his chest and back
were covered with red stripes made
by ambitious fingernails. He rested
for the remainder ot the game, being
relieved by Jimmy Benet.
Triolo Scores First
Sprint Triolo made the first goal
inside of 30 seconds. Captain Gordy
Graves would not be outdone, scored
on a long throw. Bob Foster, for
ward, slipped the first of his three
goals by the cage tender, to make
the score 3-0 inside of the first few
minutes of play.
The team was clicking, was on its
way to score the most decisive vic
tory made by any team over the
Olympic Club.
Taranik Tallies
Vlad Taranik took a long py.ss,

but his try for the goal was stopped
by Goalie Collette. Taranik went on
in, tackled the goalie and the ball
bounced in to score.
On four successive throws Tri
olo scored four times. Jimmy's
trick shots counted every time he
tried them. Score at half time:
Cards, !); Olympians, 0.
It was Leo Cook at goalie that
kept the Winged Os from scoring,
as well as a tight defense put up by
Guards Wally Wiget and Gordy
Graves. The clubmen had the ball
in Stanford's end of the pool many
times, but it was these three men
that made scoring impossible during
the first half.
O.C. Better in Second Half
Olympic Clubmen tightened in the
second period to hold Stanford to
only two more goals, and making
five for themselves.
Kenny Livingston replaced Leo
Cook at goalie for Ihe Cards. Bob
Foster took a short throw from
Benet to tally the Indians' last
and his own third score. Final score,
Stanford, 11; Olympic Club, 5.
The junior varsity closed their
season without a defeat, defeating
club subs 7-6 in a thriller. High
point man Charlie Danford ac
counted for four points.
