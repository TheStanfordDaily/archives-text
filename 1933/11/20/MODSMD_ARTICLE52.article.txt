## 
### Joe Lanidrac 
The Bear's wig, that blue and gold
mop of false locks with which the
Bear adorned himself after a 1 to 0
scalping a week ago, was snatched
off his shiny sweating skull at Sat
urday's soccer baitle in Berkeley by
a 3 to 1 score. The addition of the
fine California peruke so enlarges
the collection hanging in the Indian
wigwam that it is about to equal
that of the Conference-leading S.F.
U. Dons.
Mike Gomez, dark-haired, stellar
inside right, crackcd the ball into
! the California goalnet twice during
the game, accounting for two of the
j scores alone. Leading the field, es
pecially after the half. Gomez some
, how found time from his exceptional
| forward-line defense play and from
j his great difficulty in penetrating
i the California resistance to kick a
! beautiful score in both the second
i and third quarters.
California Scores
j With both teams lagging in their
! action beneath a hot sun, which
scattered discarded coats over the
| Edwards Field green, the Blue and
Gold left wing put new fire in both
j squads by scoring on an untouched
| corner kick. With a possible tie in
; the offing both varsities spurted for
the remainder of the game, the ball
moving up and down the field, from
foot to foot and from head to head,
like an inspired popcorn.
In the midst of all this play
Sven Doddington managed to
lower U.C.'s hopes of a draw or
victory by soaring the score up to
1 3 to 1.

i which followed was marked with
wreckless and furious goal attempts
jby the California soccermen—when

j exhausted Redmen.

and goalie, Johnson, Dick Strouse,
and Jack King, respectively, were
playing in top form. Captain Carl
Knecht was playing a superhuman
game at left, wing, Johnnie Moore
and Waddy White were doing well
as halfbacks.
The line-up forwards,: Knecht,

The Bear's wig, that blue and gold
mop of false locks with which the
Bear adorned himself after a 1 to 0
scalping a week ago, was snatched
off his shiny sweating skull at Sat
urday's soccer baitle in Berkeley by
a 3 to 1 score. The addition of the
fine California peruke so enlarges
the collection hanging in the Indian
wigwam that it is about to equal
that of the Conference-leading S.F.
U. Dons.
Mike Gomez, dark-haired, stellar
inside right, crackcd the ball into
! the California goalnet twice during
the game, accounting for two of the
j scores alone. Leading the field, es
pecially after the half. Gomez some
, how found time from his exceptional
| forward-line defense play and from
j his great difficulty in penetrating
i the California resistance to kick a
! beautiful score in both the second
i and third quarters.
California Scores
j With both teams lagging in their
! action beneath a hot sun, which
scattered discarded coats over the
| Edwards Field green, the Blue and
Gold left wing put new fire in both
j squads by scoring on an untouched
| corner kick. With a possible tie in
; the offing both varsities spurted for
the remainder of the game, the ball
moving up and down the field, from
foot to foot and from head to head,
like an inspired popcorn.
In the midst of all this play
Sven Doddington managed to
lower U.C.'s hopes of a draw or
victory by soaring the score up to
1 3 to 1.
The terminal five minutes of play
i which followed was marked with
wreckless and furious goal attempts
jby the California soccermen—when
the ball could be taken from the
j exhausted Redmen.
Team Plays Well
The Warriors played without a
single substitution, a feat seldom ac
complished. The entire squad played
a fighting game with honorable
mentions enough for all 11 players.
According to Coach Harx-y Maloney's
halftime declarations the fullbacks
