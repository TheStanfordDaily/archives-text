# WARBURTON TOPPLES TOUTED WEBFEET

"Scooter" Warburton scooted all over the field against Oregon Saturday, but his big teammate, Homer
Griffith, failed to get the call from Coach Howard Jones. Warburton threw and caught passes, called brilliant
signals, and climbed one rung higher on the all-Amcri can ladder. Mikulak and Temple, Oregon backs, staged
a couple of drives on their own part, but the Trojan power was too much, and unbeaten Oregon fell, 2G-0.
