F.R. is about to ir.ee something of
the same kind of grief that Hoover
felt so bitterly when the 73d Cong
ress convenes in six weeks. Bi
partisan support will be lacking,
even some of the Bourbon ranks
arc mumbling.
Other problems faced by first
Congress after the lame duck
amendment, include St. Lawrence
waterways program, liquor control
legislation, recess "spoils system"
appointments.
