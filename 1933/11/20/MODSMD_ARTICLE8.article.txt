## Fullback Ray Todd Proves Powerful; Bronstein Scintillates CRUSH VISITORS 33-7 Grizzlies Make Lone Score In 96-Yard Run-Back 
### Spud Hamilton 
11l drubbing Montana 33-7, Stan
i ford's coaching staff gave a crowd
jof (3,000 the opportunity of viewing
some of the lesser lights of the team
|on parade, and impressive was the
! display. Kay Todd, a hulking full—
I back, was revealed as a powerhouse
;in ball carrying ability, and little
| Shelley Bronstein, after scoring one
j touchdown from the 12-yard line,
Rave a demonstration of tight-rope
| walking down the .sidelines for 45
yards.
But if the crowd took a shine to
j the youngsters, some of the old
hands took a shine to the NRA, and
' while they were effectually resting
i after scoring once, Bob Stansberry
j of the Grizzlies took a shine for the
| goal line. He romped 9G yards
through a supine team," to a touch
-1 down from the kiekoff after Stan
ford's first score.
Macntz Clipped Out
; It was a case of "let George do
it," and George, in the form of Bob
| Maentz, who had stayed back for
'safety, was neatly clipped by Emery,
j Montana quarter.
It was an afternoon of long runs,
j Stanford's first touchdown was
I from the Montana 49-yard line, on
a reverse by Kenny Afflerbaugh.
Then came Stansberry's !)G-yard
contribution. After that Bob
Macntz reversed for 28 yards to
give Stanford a 14 to 7 lead at
half time. Corbus and Rouble
: converted for the Cardinals.
Jack Hillman made Stanford's
i only score on a power play when
he rolled over from the 2-yard line
in the third quarter to make the
boards read 20-7 for Stanford. A 27-
yard run from a reverse by Van
! Dellen had placed the ball on the
Montana 17. Van Dellen and Hill—
i man carried it the rest of the way.
Fourth Quarter Drives
The offensive drives began to
work in the fourth quarter, with
. Van Dellen at left half, and Bill Sim
'at right, Hillman at full, and Earl
lloos engineering things. This com
bination took off from the Indian
37 line, and in seven plays they
broke Sim loose on a reverse from
the 10-yard stripe. He drove straight
between Crowley and Emery over
the line.
Stanford again got the ball on
(heir own 37 and repeated with an
other drive of the same duration.
Eleven plays it took Stanford this
j time, with Bronstein springing over
! from the 12-yard line on a reverse.
Stansberry at quarter, Reynolds
: at right guard, and Anderson at left
for the Montanans were brilliant
defensively, but they were unable
to cope with simple reverse plays.
All of Stanford's touchdowns, but
Hillman's, were made from reverses.
