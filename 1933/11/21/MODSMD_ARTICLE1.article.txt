## Red Peace Message 
### 
Titular head of the Soviet Union,
Michael Kali nin, spoke to the Amer
ican people via radio yesterday. His
message, bearing no trace of Com
munistic propaganda, emphasized
peace. Said he: "The most impor
tant condition for securing the tech
nical progress and well being of the
people is the preservation and
strengthening of peace between na
tions."
The Russian formula, recognition
then discussion, became a reality in
Washington yesterday. American
claims against Russia and a pro
posed consular treaty superceded
trade relations as subject for dis
cussion. Newly appointed Soviet
Ambassador Alexander A. Troy
anovsky will most likely conclude
negotiations for Soviet purchases.
Litvinoff spent considerable time
today conferring with State Depart
ment officials and William C. Bul
litt, first American ambassador to
Soviet Russia.
