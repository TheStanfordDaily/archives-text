# Quad Studios Close Friday
## Only Half of Seniors Have Had Pictures Taken 
### 
A pitiable sight will be afforded !
those who gaze upon the senior sec- i
tion of the 1934 Quad, stated Editor j
A1 Sadler last night, as only half of '
the class of '34 have had their pic
tures taken.
This calamity may be averted J
only by prompt action since the j
campus studio closes this Friday, j
leaving just a week in which the i
photographs may be taken.
"The book, put out chiefly for the ,
seniors, should receive whole
hearted support from that class,'' '
said Sadler emphatically. "Their
negligence in attending to the mat
ter of pictures for the Quad v is con- j
trary to the necessary spirit of co
operation which should prevail," he
added.
Appointments may be procured by
phoning the Quad office, 3308, be- i
tween 1 and 3 o'clock in the after
noon.
Local members of medical frater
nities are asked to call for appoint- ;
ments. Cap and Gown members and '
debaters will be pictured today.
