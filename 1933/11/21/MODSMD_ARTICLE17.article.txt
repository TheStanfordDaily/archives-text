# SEATS SELLFAST FOR "GAIETIES" FRIDAY EVENING
## Chorus in Chains, Heche Opus Are Specialty Numbers 
### 
While the beat, beat, beat of stage
hammers; thump, thump, thump (if
j syncopated rhythm on the piano,
i and the tap, tap, tap of dancing feet
I rang through the Assembly Hall
! yesterday; the clink, clink, clink of
j silver dollars that rang in the largest
seat sale opening for the Gaieties in
[ four years, sang tunes in dramatic
Manager Ben Cave's ears.
In a silvery rhyme, $250 poured
l into the dramatic coffers yesterday,
i The years before $58 had been the
j first day limit.
Scats to lie Had
Cave announces seats may be had
j every day this week at the Engifieer
i ing corner from 10 till 2 o'clock and
!at the A.S.S.U. office. Prompt ac
j tion will secure the many good seats
left as the new policy is "first come,
j first served."
Having the whole Stanford team
in attendance in a specially reserved
; section is attracting students as well
I as the exceptionally low prices of 50
I and 75 cents and $1, thinks Man
( ager Cave.
Emerging from the many rhythms
on the Assembly Hall stage, many
! new acts were being whipped into
| shape yesterday.
Chain Number
A big link in the musical sequence
I will be the Chorus in Chains, for
i which long, clanky Winstead Wea
| ver concocted the music. Much time
! and effort have besn used to advan
j tage in this chorus, which requires
, supreme unity and rhythm in order
' to be the effective, compelling num
: ber expected.
Again we have a Winstead Weaver
musical masterpiece: "So Much
' Time Wasted," to be sung by Har
! riet Hall and Phil Brown. And
"Women Are Like Duplex Apart
i mcnts," by Pete Peck and Richard
1 Sheretz, has curiosity on the ram
j Page.
Ileche Music
The powers behind the Gaieties
throne threaten to put on "Campus
Honeymoon"â€”an opus by Musical
Director Gordon Heche. And those
campus celebrities, "Howdie" Smith
; and Virginia Marvin, have written
and will sing (respectively) "Aw,
\'ou Went and Did It Again."
"Love Happened to Me" and "I'm
Positive That I Love You," with mu
sic by Eleanor Weinmann and ly
rics by Dorothy Bernhardt, will un
doubtedly be popular features of a
super production.
