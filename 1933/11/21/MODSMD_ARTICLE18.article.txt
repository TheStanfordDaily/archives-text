# 15,000 Tickets Remain On Sale for Big Game
## 
### 
About 15,000 tickets, some of them
spread among several agencies along
the peninsula and in East bay cities,
.are still on general sale for the Big
Game, A1 Masters, graduate man
ager of the Board of Athletic Con
trol, said last night.
Officials here have been rushed
ofT their feet by late comers desir
jing rooters' tickets. Masters said
! these have been entirely sold out,
and none could be returned.
Reports from Berkeley point to
the fact that the Stanford ticket al
lotment is going faster than is that
at California. However, the Bear
rooting section was reported a sell-
I out.
Stanford's practically inevitable
choice as a Rose Bowl contestant in
!the event the Indians win the Big
] Game is held responsible for the
fact that Farm boosters arc pur
chasing the pasteboards faster than
Cal backers.
