# Axe Raiders of Gay '90s Stole Blade From Hayden

### FRANCES AYRES 
Editor's Note: This is the second
: of a series of special articles, tracing
the history of the Stanford Axe.

Just as Norm Horner was the goat
in the Stanford 1930 capture of the
Axe, Carl Hayden was "picked" 34
years ago when California stole the
sacred blade.
Disgusted that the newly acquired
I mascot hadn't brought the Cardinals
| good luck in their baseball series,
Yell Leader Billy Erb told Hayden
to transport the Axe back to the
| Farm after ihe U.C. game which was
i played in San Francisco.
With two companions, Hayden
I carried the blade openly, no doubt
I thinking it a valueless tradition that
] would soon be discarded. Fate in
tervened at the gates where a Stan
ford tackle who had been taking
tickets reported he had wind of a
Cal plan to swipe the Axe.
Not caring particularly about the
Axe, but feeling Cal had gotten
I away with enough that day, the
four men took an Horatius-like
stand against a horde of Blue and
Gold mobsters. Unequal odds forced
them to lose their grip, and Custo
dian Hayden saw his charge being

! carried away by the fleet Bear foot
baller, Paul Castlehun.
A tricky relay offense kept the
stolen blade ahead of the howling
crowd that pursued its captors. As
each runner tired, hr lateraled the
10-pound hatchet to the nearest Cal
man who carried it on. Tradition
says a Stanford hurdler, named
Drumm. caught on to the system
and had the Axe hurled to him,
and would have gotten away with
it, had not a flying tackle brought
him down.
j After this hectic relay, Cal cap
tors took a stolon horse and wagon
1 and then to a street car in their
dash across San Francisco ,to the
waterfront. Hayden, feeling his re
sponsibility,'phoned the chief of po
lice.. who had all suspicious-looking
characters around the Ferry Build
ing arrested.
But the Axe was already on its
'way across the bay the next
31 years of its eventful life were to
be spent. The hatchet was smuggled
aboard the ferry by a long-skirted
Cal coed, who remains an unsung
and unidentified heroine of tradi
tion.
Tomorrow: Stanford's early at
tempts to regain tluÂ« Axe.
