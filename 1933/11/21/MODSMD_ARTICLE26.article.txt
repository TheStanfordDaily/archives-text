# Sir Norman Angell To Speak To-Night On Present Crisis
## Distinguished Englishman To Tell of Ways Out 
### Will Williams 
Sir Norman Angell, described as
a prophet whose prophecies have
come true, will address an Assembly
Hall audience this evening at
o'clock under the auspices of th<?
Committee on Public Exercises on a
subject pregnant with meaning: "The
Crisis in Democracy: Ways Out."
Tonight's speaker is unique in
this: he has secured for books deal
ing with politics and economics,
usually thought to be dry and ab
struse subjects, the sale of best sel
lers in fiction. His famous book,
"The Great Illusion," has sold well
over half a million copies and has
been translated into 25 languages.

"He must rank,'' says the London
Nation (which does not pass such
verdicts lightly), "among the great
est of our pamphleteers, perhaps
the greatest since Swift." An Amer
ican authority, Mr. Walter Lipp
mann, writing nearly 10 years later,
almost repeats the verdict in de
scribing an address of Mr. Norman
Angell: "It has never been put more
eloquently or more impressively. It
is done with a skill, and good hu
mour and damaging logic, un
equalled, I believe, by any advocate
in the English-speaking world."
His lecture experience has been
extensive. Having spent a part of
his youth in America on a Califor
nia ranch, been a frequent visitor
to this country, a constant contrib
utor to the American press, he is
able to grasp the American point of
view and render the treatment' of
the subjects with which he deals
interesting to an American audience.
Spoke Here Before
Sir Norman Angell was a speaker
at Stanford University a number of
years ago, and has been scheduled
to speak since, but prevented by his
health. His broad point of view
comes, of course, from his rather
unique background of English birth,
French education, American expe
rience, business association for many
years with men like the late Lord
Northcliffe, and the friendship of
men of letters and political leaders
of all parties in both France and
England.
Having expressed his ideal of a
lecture as '"a conversation with the
audience," Sir Norman has been
said to be almost abnormally calm
and reasonable, even though he is,
at the same time, in deadly earnest.
He is the type of man who instinct
ively braces his mind against the
emotional currents which in recent,
years have swept many more orig
inal thinkers than he claims to be
off their feet.

ing with politics and economics,
usually thought to be dry and ab
struse subjects, the sale of best sel
lers in fiction. His famous book,
"The Great Illusion," has sold well
over half a million copies and has
been translated into 25 languages.

"He must rank,'' says the London
Nation (which does not pass such
verdicts lightly), "among the great
est of our pamphleteers, perhaps
the greatest since Swift." An Amer
ican authority, Mr. Walter Lipp
mann, writing nearly 10 years later,
almost repeats the verdict in de
scribing an address of Mr. Norman
Angell: "It has never been put more
eloquently or more impressively. It
is done with a skill, and good hu
mour and damaging logic, un
equalled, I believe, by any advocate
in the English-speaking world."
His lecture experience has been
extensive. Having spent a part of
his youth in America on a Califor
nia ranch, been a frequent visitor
to this country, a constant contrib
utor to the American press, he is
able to grasp the American point of
view and render the treatment' of
the subjects with which he deals
interesting to an American audience.
Spoke Here Before
Sir Norman Angell was a speaker
at Stanford University a number of
years ago, and has been scheduled
to speak since, but prevented by his
health. His broad point of view
comes, of course, from his rather
unique background of English birth,
French education, American expe
rience, business association for many
years with men like the late Lord
Northcliffe, and the friendship of
men of letters and political leaders
of all parties in both France and
England.
Having expressed his ideal of a
lecture as '"a conversation with the
audience," Sir Norman has been
said to be almost abnormally calm
and reasonable, even though he is,
at the same time, in deadly earnest.
He is the type of man who instinct
ively braces his mind against the
emotional currents which in recent,
years have swept many more orig
inal thinkers than he claims to be
off their feet.
Sir Norman Angell, described as
a prophet whose prophecies have
come true, will address an Assembly
Hall audience this evening at
o'clock under the auspices of th<?
Committee on Public Exercises on a
subject pregnant with meaning: "The
Crisis in Democracy: Ways Out."
Tonight's speaker is unique in
this: he has secured for books deal
ing with politics and economics,
usually thought to be dry and ab
struse subjects, the sale of best sel
lers in fiction. His famous book,
"The Great Illusion," has sold well
over half a million copies and has
