# Politics Is a Horrid Word
## 
### 
Stanford students do learn certain tilings al Stanfordâ€”
vitriol-pulling cynics to the contrary. We learn that poli
tics are dirtv. We learn that politicians are a terrible lot.
And of course that Tammany combines the worst politi
cians and the worst politics.
At that point, however, the course in Citizenship comes
to a close; and the average student's education in govern
ment comes to an abrupt finish. Those tliat take some po
litical science learn more. They finally understand that
politics is very dirty. And politicians are very terrible.
Hut that is the end of ends. The idea that all these
tilings have timely application is unknown. The further
idea that these concepts have a campus significance is be
yond the realm of general comprehension. That would
be 100 amazing to contemplate.
Very few students, and less faculty, would admit that a
college education has no significance to the state. On the
contrary, the social value of colleges is prated up one side
of the continent and down the other.
Hut actually, the Administration does little to realize
these high and worthy ideals. A lecture every now and
then stressing the startling biological fact that the boys and
girls of today are the voters of tomorrow, and a few re
quired courses is all that the I Diversity does to insure a
grasp of political affairs by the students.
Everyone knows that the movement of four speedy
"backs" around left end is more interesting than the move
ment of gold on the international market. Yet everyone
feels that students should know the latter activity.
A recent dispatch from Spain declares that the uni
versities were closed on election day, presumably because
students were so active in political affairs that the mere
routine of the classroom could not compete. Would any
one ever think of disbanding our classes for such a reason ?
J!' they did, the only result would be more people at the
movies, golf-course, and the bills.
Even admitting that national politics are so remote and
so obscure that students should not be expected to partici
pate, what about the local scene?
The sweet-smelling platitudes about public service, line
loyalty, etc., of the classroom do not exist in the gyrations
of local leaders. Would-be bosses, patronage, bunk -all
exist here. Hut who is interested?
