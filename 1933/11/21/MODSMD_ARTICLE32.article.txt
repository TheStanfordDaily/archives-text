# Serpents and Success
## 
### 
Reports that a sea serpent ninety feet long is sporting
in Ihe Pacific oil Canada have been found to be based on
Ihe accounts ol people who were fooled by the appearance
of a school of dolphins. Similarly, the t'.S.C. myth has at
last been seen lor what il is. The Southern California fish
is no bigger than the rest of the fish in the ocean.
I> cry thing in life is pretty much Ihe'same. We have
found that going to college is not the terrific task we once
thought, (letting a place in Ihe sun after graduation will
not prove .as hard as il looks. Consider the men of the
older generation who have been able to rise to fame and
fortune. Achieving success cannot be as difficult as it seems
from a distance.
