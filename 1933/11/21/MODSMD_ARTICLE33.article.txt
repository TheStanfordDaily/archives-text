# Tokyo Happy Too

### 
Anxious official Tokyo rejoiced
yesterday in the appointment of Al
exander Troyanovsky as Russian
ambassador to Washington. The
American-bound diplomat, former
Ambassador to Japan, "is a good
friend of Japan," and will probably
promote better understanding be
tween the three nations, says an
official Japanese spokesman.
Niponese circles refused to admit
the possibility that Russia is send
ing Troyanovsky to Washington as
a specially-qualified pleader of the
Soviet's case to America.
