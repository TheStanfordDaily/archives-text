THE EMPEROR JONES
(Gruenberg)
War Memorial Opera House
Curiosity was the attendant at the
performance of ''Emperor Jones,"
and curiosity found it an American
opera perhaps better or perhaps
worse than it had expected.
Gruenberg has not really written
an opera at all. In one sense, how
ever, he has illustrated with con
siderable success an original pur
pose of opera—to make music the
chromatic emphasis of drama. But,
as a whole, "Emperor Jones" re
mains merely a play with inciden
tal music.
In setting theatrical tour
de force, Gruenberg has concocted
intermezzi of severe, tricky, yet sim
ple material and some excitably bar
baric choruses for the bush-niggers,
j who appear briefly between each
scene of Jones' flight through the
l jungle. For the rest, the main ac
i tion demands from the singers onfy
spoken speeches and a sort of re
• eitativo, which have an orchestral
i accompaniment of unobtrusive va
riations.
This impartial running comment
tends to make the opera unclimatic,
for Gruenberg has chosen not to give
full accent to the relentless tom
toms, which were used in the legiti
mate play with such effectiveness.
Instead their rhythm maintains a
static consistency which does not
give the impression that the bush
niggers are really closing in on
Jones. This, couplsd with fmpi-eci
sion and monotony, makes the last
scenes seem a decline from the co
ordinate tempo of the earlier Palace
scene with Smithers.
The staging was perhaps more at
fault than the music. The "Samson
et Dalila" pallid garden setting
i hardly suggested a West Indian
jungle, and the important visionary
figures were so realistic as to be
anarchronisms. The finale, too, of
the Witch Doctor's dance and the
triumph of the niggers was very in
adequately conceived.
The moments of truly emotional
intensity which "Emperor Jones"
1 had were due to the fine work of
| Lawrence Tibbett. There is surely
not another singer in America who
could have done Jones with equal
artistry, and Tibbett essayed his re
citation with grandiose vigor and
relish. His characterization had
earnestness and breadth, from the
humorous braggadocio to the skill
ful manipulation of wasting vitality.
His vivid baritone was not called
into song often, but did neat service
in the fragmentary chorus of a spir
itual and the infrequent recitatives.
The burden of the 'entire play rests
on Jones, and Tibbett gave him the
i proper lurches, rants, and yells.

| The eerie black chorus sang well,
and Pelletier conducted the orches- j
tra with discrimination through a |
, score considerably more intricate
' than its sounds.
