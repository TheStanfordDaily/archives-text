# League Relapse
## 
### 
A decidedly sick League of Na
tions had a serious relapse yester- !
day. Cause for the setback: re
ported, rumored Italian resignation.
Worried Secretary-General Avenol
left post-haste for Rome, will dis
cuss this and dying Arms Parley
with II Duce.
Further doses of the pulmotor
(recesses) were prescribed for the
bedridden patient by doctoring
statesmen. The end i.s expected soon.
U.S. opinion is sought as to advisa
bility of prolonging the agony.
