## COAST CONFERENCE AINT WHAT IT USED TO BE 
### 
The U.C.L.A. Bruins traveled
some thousand or oo miles last week,
all for the questionable pleasure of
playing Washington s Huskies in a
layer of fog that blotted out the
game for the spectators and for the
players themselves. It ended with
the Bruins clinging fast to the old
say that a southern team just doesn't
b''at a northern team on their home
field. The Uclans fiddled around in
the fog, and Bill Smith sneaked
over a victory for Washington.
Th e only reason the game was ever
played was respect to the Pacific
Coast Conference. There was no
traditional interest; nobody gave a
damn, and showed it by staying
away in large numbers. The U.C.
L.A. business department must have
been highly edified with the sprink
ling of fans who literally cooled their
heels in the stands, waiting for
.something to happen.
The Pacific Coast Conference has
no legitimate reason ' for existence,
in our opinion. If it has, can some
one kindly point it out? lt.s charac
teristic role consists in acting the
übiquitous Paul Pry for the benefit
of no one but the crusading clan
who would emasculate football un
til it was depressed to little Rollo
in-his-new - cowboy - uniform pro
portions.
There is no Conference cham
pionship. There is no fine engraved
loving cup, or lemonade pitcher with
set of silver mugs tc go to the so
called Conference winners each
year. That is all public opinion, and
the Conference standing that one
sees published occasionally are un
oflicial newspaper tabulations.
The Conference is no longer of
use to the big teams; they have out
grown its provincial limitations long
ago. It does help out the minor
teams, who would be hard pressed
for full schedules, il Conference ob
ligations did not ltquire that the
nationally known teams schedule
them for breathers. That is why we
have such listless occasions as last
Saturday in the stadium, with a
small crowd, a crew of visitors
going through the motions, and an
uninspired home team trying to
dodge possible injuries that would
keep them out of the Big Game
coming up.
These small teams play good foot
ball, considering their circumstances,
but they are simply reaching out of
their class. It's entertaining to see
a Polytechnic and Lowell scrap but
pit either team against a college
team, and a most boring afternoon
would ensue.
Brick Morse, for once, is right.
The Coast Conference has outgrown
its usefulness, and it's time to call
lor a new deck. Tradition, competi
tive fitness, sectional leadership—
ihese should decide football rivals
—not the obligations to a loosely
tied group of good, bad, and indif
ferent teams, scattered all over the
Pacific Coast and inland points.
