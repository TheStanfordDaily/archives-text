# Corbus, O'Connor, Hamilton Show Offense Power
## INDIANS MELT FOG IN SPIRITED DRILL ON B FORMATION 
### 
By Oliver Johnston. Jr.
A pea soup fog was melted away
last night by a fiery bunch of In
dians working late in the evening
under powerful searchlights.
Formation B from an unbalanced
punt formation, with a double hike
system took up most of the session.
The double hike mixed up with a
single hike will make it harder for
the defense to tell when the ball
will be snapped.
The Indians came out in their
peppermint suits and looked pretty
while photographers took pictures. (
It was the last time that the red
and white outfits will be worn. They
will appear in the lucky tan and
white outfits, worn in the Trojan
game, next Saturday.
First-String Line to Start
The first-string line of Moscrip J
and Norgard, ends; Calloway and i
Reynolds, tackles; Corbus and :
O'Connor, guards; and Muller, cen
ter, is certain to start against tht'
Bears.
Hamilton, Maentz, Grayson, and i
Alustiza are pretty sure to be the
starting backfield combination if '
they are all intact. Grayson did not |
seem bothered by his ankle last i
night, taking several speed jaunts !
up and down the field.
Bill Corbus polished off his shoe 1
with some placekicking. The angle
doesn't make any difference to Bill
anywhere inside the 25-yard line.
Two of Stanford's Conference games '
have been won by his educated toe,
and the odds are all in favor of his |
breaking into the scoring column
again next Saturday if he gets half
a chance.
Mythical Scrimmage
The dummy bags were set up to
represent the California backfield. j
Corbus, O'Connor, and Hamilton de
cided they didn't like the dummies I
and proceeded to tear them to !
pieces. They were coming out of the
line and backfield with so much
speed that it would have been tragic
to get in the way. When this trio ;
gets out in front of Grayson or any |
other fast back who can keep up !
with them he is officially away to a i
touchdown.
Moscrip took several more trys at I
his end around play. Dink Temple- '
ton says that Monk is -the fastest
man for the first 20 yards on the
squad. That is why Tiny has so
much faith in the play because there
isn't a chance of Moscrip being j
caught from behind.
