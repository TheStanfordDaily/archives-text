# Med Students May Meet In Grid Game Friday
## 
### 
Medical students will forsake their J
carving knives and study the human ,
anatomy on a football field Friday
afternoon, if the second-year medi
cal students accept the challenge of |
the first-year class to a game of ;
touch football.
Customary challengers, second- j
year students have forgotten their j
duty; first-year students have taken j
the matter into their own hands; j
ask their elders to answer the chal- i
lenge and make arrangements with !
Charles Bechtol. If arrangements are i
made, the game will be played at
4:30 o'clock on one of the intramural j
football fields."
Quotes an Arizona senior: The I
ideal girl is one who doesn't paint I
her fingernails and toenails red, and j
doesn't say "cute."
