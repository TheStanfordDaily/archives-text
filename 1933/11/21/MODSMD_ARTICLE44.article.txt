to San Francisco, trouncing all
challengers to its N.C.W.P. crown. ,

California's game this week with
the Olympic Club will cither make
or break the golden ones who can
win the league by taking this one
and whipping Stanford next Tues
day.
O.C. Favorites Over Bears
Clubmen, however, will be defi
nite favorites in this close tussle.
Their Ginger Austin was well bot
tled up by experienced Stanford
guards, but Cai will have a tougher
time with the sharpishooting veteran
for they have no guards to equal
Wally Wiget and team Captain
Goidy Graves.
Freshmen, allowed one off-campus

Water polomen, with no game on
their hands this week, face sessions
of long scrimmages to toughen
themselves up for the season's last
game.
The winter round of the Northern
California Water Polo League opens
in February during which Stanford
will play all of its games at home
in their own Encina pools.
