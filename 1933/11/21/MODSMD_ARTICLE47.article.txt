# POLOISTS BATTLE SAN MATEO FOUR FRIDAY AFTERNOON
## 
### 
( To give his polo quartet some
.stiff competition in preparation for
next week's Arizona trip, Captain
Gordan has tentatively scheduled a
game with the San Fdateo Polo Club
next Friday afternoon on the Stan
ford field.
With San Mateo capable of putting
a team of any desired strength on
the field, Gordan has requested the
clubmen to send down their strong-*
est representatives. Since the In
dians' two earlier games this season
have been fairly easy, at least one
good workout is considered neces
sary before the Wildcat series dur
ing the Thanksgiving holidays.
Luppe Luppen, hard-riding num- }
ber one man and veteran from last |
j season, was recently elected captain
;of this year's team. Teaming with
Luppen throughout the season have
I been Kemp Maer Et number two,
Woody Melone at three, and Bill
Rogers at back.
A second team line-up that Cap
tain Gordan rates as practically on
a par with his first-stringers in
j eludes Harold Anderson, at one;
I

Frank Burns, at two; Russell Ras
mussen, at three; and Bob Fuller
ton, at back.
