# HOLE IN ONE SUNK ON EIGHTH GREEN BY GENE BROWN
## 
### 
L I To his list of glowing nmshie
| accomplishments, Gene Brown, Pa-
I rifle coast intercollegiate golf cham-
I pion, has added another, a hole in
1 | one. The ace was scored on the
(eighth hole of the course during
| play with Don Edwards and Jack
Cox late yesterday afternoon.
The eighth hole is a par 3 of 125
yards. The tee is located high on a
hill which overlooks the green. How
ever, between the tee and the green
is a water hazard which traps not
a few short shots. On both sides of
! the green are deep, dangerous sand
traps. The hole in generally in the
1 center of the green which breaks
I sharply.
As far as could be ascertained
i there has only been one other hole
I in one scored on the Stanford course
I since its opening four years ago.
That one was made by Gordy White
!on the seventeenth hole. Playing
with Laddie Hellman, Dave May,
and Stewart Hawley, White scored
| the first ace on the course. That
! was three ago in 1931.
Brown's accomplishment is the
first ace known to the present group
t of Stanford golfers and the second
! known in the history of the course,
j Other Stanford men have hole-in
j one honors, but they have been won
ion other courses. Don Edwards,
i witness to Brown's hole in one won
i his ace honors on iiis home course in
' San Jose.
