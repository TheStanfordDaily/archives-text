# STUDENTS LACK IN WORLDLINESS

'"Stanford students haven't much
; of an idea of what's going on in the
world," said Kenneth Stewart, in
-1 structor in journalism, as he leaned
back in his office chair, and talked
genially of the East and the West.
I "This unawareness is due to their
isolation, I believe. After seeing two
or three breadlines on your way to
, school, as you do if you live in New
York City, you naturally begin to
wonder what it's all about," stated
Stewart, former Stanford student
and Columbia graduate.
Situated as Stanford is near non
industrial Palo Alto, students don't
! know what the slums are, can not
j really know what unemployment is,
! and consequently don't take much
i interest in world or national affairs,
j Stewart believes.
Another reason for the difference
.in outlook between Stanford and
Columbia students is the character
lof the student bodies. At Columbia,
| a scion of a wealthy New York fam
ily may sit next to a negro from
1 Harlem, a Chinese or a Japanese,
j There is a bigger cross section and a
i wider range of humanity at Colum
i bia.
At Slanford the students are
largely drawn from one strata of
I society. There are no striking dif
! ferences in social position, and, it
i follows, a less cosmopolitan outlook.
Freed from the crowded, noisy, pol
luted atmosphere of the big city,
Stanford students are apt to take
j advantage of the climatic and free
| air, and take it easy, concentrating
j largely on academic work, Stewart
I concluded.
