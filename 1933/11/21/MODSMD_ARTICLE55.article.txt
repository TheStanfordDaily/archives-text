# EXCLUSION OF JEWS IN NEXT OLYMPICS PROTESTED BY AMATEUR ATHLETIC UNION
## 
### Spud Hamilton 
The Amateur Athletic Union, |
meeting in Pittsburgh yesterday, j
rumbled a warning against German !
exclusion of Jews from the 1936 |
Olympiad, and threatened to with
draw U.S. participation, according to
the Associated Press. The committee
also adopted the report of the track |
and field committee urging reten
tion of the metric system.
Meanwhile Dink Templeton, Stan
ford track coach, rumbled his own ;
warning again st heavy-handed
methods in the proceedings of the
august sports ruling body. Pet aver
sion of Templeton in x'ecent years
has been AA.U.
A small group including A.C. Gil
bert, Gustavus Kirby. Henry Shulte
(Nebraska U. track coach) and,
George Bresnahan (lowa track
coach) are hogging A.A.U. direction,
says Templeton.
Moreover, the same crew will at
tempt to oversee the American
Olympic Association meeting set for j

Washington this Saturday. The 1
AA.U. band has effectively sched- j
ulcd the meeting at this time, be- J
lieves Templeton, in order to prevent |
any interference by the colleges, j
who are now busy with the high
spot of football season.
"All the coaches are against the
metric system," he said. "Last year
they voted on it before the ICAAAA
meeting in Philadelphia, and it was
beaten 28-2." Dear. Cromwell of j
Southern California was one of the
two dissenters, and it is understood
that he has since changed his views.
Coach Templeton reiterated his
contention that the National Colle
giate Athletic Association should
break away from the A.A.U., run
its own business.
