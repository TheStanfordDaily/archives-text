## 
### 
Springing out of a dark corner of i
the metallurgy lab of the State Col
lege of Washington, an apparently '
insane marauder one night last week
flashed a Colt .45 in the face of five
students who had been sent to cor
ner the intruder.
By means of clever co-operation
and a few jiu-jitsu tactics the
searchers managed to grab the gun ;
and collar the robber, who later I
stated that he had been sent by the
Governor "to find out where all the
taxpayers' money is going to."
