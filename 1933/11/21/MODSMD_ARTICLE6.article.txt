# Would Keep NRA

### 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce Prexy
Harriman .spoke calmly, critically, of
NRA and AAA. The time had come,
he thought, to give credit and con
structive criticism. The two recov
ery acts must nevor be abandoned
since an orderly economic life must
replace the chaos of the last five
years, hut the policy of compulsion
must be thrown out, a more or
derly, voluntary presentation of
codes adopted.
In the country, continued the
arch-tycoon, high NRA-made costs
do not jibe with lcw-price markets,
and small town manufacturers con
sequently find themselves backed to
the wall.
As to the hiring-fiiing angle: What
with compulsory recognition of
unions, minimum wages, et al., he
feels labor got a great break. Now
it would be "nicer" if labor leaders
restrained themselves in the calling
of strikes; too many have been "un
authorized and unwarranted."

The business man then took up
agriculture, felt fine about the two
billions more income J. Farmer
would be getting this year, but was
saddened that no aid was given cat
tle and beet sugar industries.
Rejoicing, the constructive critic,
the biggest C.-of-Cer, took another
glass of water, said something ought
to be done to quiet nation-wide
knocking of recovery, and, then just
like anybody else, he sat down.
