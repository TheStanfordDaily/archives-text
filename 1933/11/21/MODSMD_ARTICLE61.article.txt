# "Annie" Haunts Menlo Cemetery; Students Dance
## 
### 
What to do Sunday night was
nicely solvecj, by two Stanford
couples who went dancing at
the Valpariso avenue cemetery
in Menlo Park.
Eerie noises that broke the
Sabbath cahn of the evening
and probably set Menlo resi
dents to talking about haunted
graveyards, were only the
strains of "Annie Doesn't Live
Here Anymore," arriving via
the radio attached to the stu
dents' car.
To the music of hot-cha and
sophiscated orchestras for four
collegiates had what they con
siderate "a swell time" dancing
on the graves and over the
tombstones of the "dear de
parted."
