"Ati all-freshman hall perpetuates
Freshmanitus," said Miss Anastasia
Doyle, director ""'of Roble Hall, in
discussing the still unsettled prob
lem of housing new women at Stan
ford.
She explained the symptoms of
this contagious ailment as "thinking
it fun to evade rules and get away
from the big, bad policeman, and
staying up very late or all night to
study, then bragging about it." "Ir
regular and faddish eating, noise
caused by ganging together, and
eternal bull sessioning and pointless
talking in which men loom Targe,"
were also mentioned as noticeably
freshman characteristics.
Miss Doyle pointed out, however,
that there were distinct advantages
to the plan of housing the freshmen
women together, because the entire
orientation program can be central
ized in one dormitory. The group
can be reached mine easily and the

program put over more effectively.
"Then, too, the old ideas .are not
perpetuated; sometimes that is
good," .she added with a significant I
smile.
This year at Roble Hall there are j
70 old women.to 180 new women, all j
but 10 of whom are freshmen. Even
that small proportion of upper divi- J
sion women keeps the freshmanitus |
epidemic from being more severe, j
according to the dormitory director. !
"We now have a nucleus of old !
girls in each corridor to perpetuate
the established Stanford ideals," she
explained.
There is no noticeable change in i
the amount of dating or the number
of late leaves and lockouts since the j
invasion of the more socially-minded
new women, records show.
"I find them an exceedingly pleas
ant and self-respecting group with -
which to work. The general spiiit ,
of accepting necessary restrictions is j
fine, said Miss Doyi.\
