## Fiscal Adviser Out 
### 
Dr. O. M. W. Sprague, F.R.'s old
Harvard prof., former economics ad
viser to the Bank of England and
.stabilization fund director, resigned
yesterday as special adviser to the
U.S. Treasury. Sprague had worked
out a plan at World Economic Con
ference for international monetary
stabilization.
Suddenly F.R., in Washington,
turned thumbs down, stabilization
failed, the Econ. Conference went
out with it. Sprague returned to
Washington. A sound money man
(like Sec. Woodin on leave and Act
ing Sec. Acheson, forced to resign),
he has not gained audience with
F.R. since. Meanwhile F.R. has em
barked on newfangled gold-buying,
price-raising plan. •
* * *
Said Sprague: "We are faced with
unrestrained inflation, a total col
lapse of government credit (gov
ernment bonds are below par now)."
Two billions in excess of tax re
ceipts are needed this year. Bonds
must meet the deficit, yet investors,
knowing they will depreciate in pur
chasing power, will refuse to buy
them. Paper money will have to be
printed. Depreciation on foreign ex
change is easy; the only way short
of suicidal inflation to increase do
mestic price, is by raising con
sumer buying power. We may soon
have public distrust of currency
equal to pre-holiday fear of banks."
Concerning Sprague's resignation,
Acting Sec. Morganthau wise
cracked: "The sun will rise tomor
row and the next day the birds will
sine."
