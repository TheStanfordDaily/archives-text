# Cards Failed in Early Efforts to Regain Axe
## 
### FRANCES AYRES 
EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the third
of a series of special articles, tracing
the history of the Stanford Axe.
Harry Dutton came nearer to ac
tually recapturing the Axe than any
other Stanfordite until the triumph
of the "21." Dutton's attempts were
made in 1899 when Cal was gullible
and not exactly sure what to do with
the newly stolen blade.
Posing as a loyal son of California,
Dutton rode a prancing horse in the
first gigantic parade and rally that
celebrated the appropriation of the
Axe by U.C. lie obligingly offered to
hold the hatchet, and Custodian
Charlie Pringle passed it up to him.
Cal students cheered and led Dut
t< n's horse at the head of the pro
cession. But an inopportune turn
stile through which he could not
ride, forced him to give the Axe
back to its captors.
Will Irwin, author of the Axe yell,
concocted one of the most elaborate
(hemes to regain the trophy.

1 Strained relations between the two
I universities prompted an agreement
that thei'e would be no more Stan
ford raids for the purpose of get
" ting the Axe. Irwin, having been
expelled in 1808, conceived the idea
of stealing an important Cal trophy
that could be held as hostage un
til the Axe was returned.
On April 24, 1808, three wagon
loads of students journeyed to
Berkeley and succeeded in acquir
, ins* the Senior Fence. At 9:30 o'clock
the next morning they telegraphed
the news from Milpitas and were
met by half of the Stanford campus
at Alvi.so. No classes were held that
day, as impromptu rallies cele
brated.
| California, however, wouldn't play
the game and adopted a bored, in-
I different attitude, thanking the Car
dinals for relieving it of the Fence.
Thus another attempt to regain the
Axe was fruitless.
