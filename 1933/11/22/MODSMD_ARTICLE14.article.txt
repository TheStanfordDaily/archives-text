## Treasury Constitutionality Notes As Debt Tender To Be Discussed 
### Owen Ulph 
The New Deal! Is it constituti
onal? Those who attend the opening
session of moot court, in Room 12 of
the Law School at 8 o'clock tonight
will get some authentic dope, un
embellished by unqualified personal
opinion, when Ferd Fletcher and
Homer Kidwell will fight it out with
Robert Barbour and Lester McEl
wain in an actual courtroom combat.
Case Will Reveal Truth
Hot-headed tycoons, desk-pound
ing debaters who.se motives are
without exception to win an argu
ment rather than reveal the truth,
and a majority of the American
public, have wrangled over this
question ever since the National Re
covery Act was injected into eco
nomic society last spring. Tonight
the prospective bar men will pre
sent the case minus the meaningless
repartee and philosophical abstrac
tions that accompany most forums
that deal with such topics.
Is N.R.A. Legal?
Congress proclaims U.S. treasury
notes to be legal tender for the pay
ment of all debts —business men
have drawn up contracts which
specify that debts must be paid in
gold. Result: considerable friction
between government and public.
Who is right? President Roosevelt
issues an order to call in all gold.
Is this legal, according to U.S. law?
Are all aspects of the Roosevelt Na
tional Recovery Act legitimate in
relationship with human rights? All
these questions will come to the sur
face, be torn apart for inspection,
and presented before Arthur M.
Cathcart, professor in the Law
i School, who will act as judge for
tonight's legal hostilities.
The winning attorneys of to
night's fray will participate' in the
semi-final of moot court which will
come off in winter quarter. Spring
quarter will see the final court
battle.
Cathcart to Talk
At the conclusion of the case to
night, Mr. Cathcart will give a talk
on the written law of the case so
that the audience may understand
for themselves the actual stand
which the Constitution takes on the
i N.R.A. undertaking.
Exceptional public interest should
' surround the decision of Judge
Cathcart tonight, as in all probabil
; ity the case will come up in the Su-
I preme Court in the astonishingly
near future. The decision will serve
to show just how near Stanford cub
lawyers came to the actual facts of
the case.

' surround the decision of Judge

; ity the case will come up in the Su-
I preme Court in the astonishingly

The New Deal! Is it constituti
onal? Those who attend the opening
session of moot court, in Room 12 of
the Law School at 8 o'clock tonight
will get some authentic dope, un
embellished by unqualified personal
opinion, when Ferd Fletcher and
Homer Kidwell will fight it out with
Robert Barbour and Lester McEl
wain in an actual courtroom combat.

Hot-headed tycoons, desk-pound

without exception to win an argu
ment rather than reveal the truth,
and a majority of the American
public, have wrangled over this

covery Act was injected into eco
nomic society last spring. Tonight
the prospective bar men will pre
sent the case minus the meaningless
repartee and philosophical abstrac
tions that accompany most forums
that deal with such topics.
Is N.R.A. Legal?
Congress proclaims U.S. treasury
notes to be legal tender for the pay

have drawn up contracts which
specify that debts must be paid in
gold. Result: considerable friction
between government and public.
