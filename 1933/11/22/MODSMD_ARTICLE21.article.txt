# ANGELL FLAYS PRESENT PLANS FOR EDUCATION
## Assembly Hears British Writer Score Blind Democratic Faith 
### Will Williams 
I A packed Assembly Hall listened i
:to a short, dynamic little Britisher j
excoriate the deliberate blindness to i
facts of most members of democra- ;
cies, in the best Tuesday evening
lecture to date.
"The war to make the world safe J
for democracy has resulted in an
j epidemic of distatorships," he an- I
j nounced.
Forceful Speaker
| Though firmly convinced of the ;
'soundness of his beliefs, Sir Norman
iAngeil, the speaker, does not deliver
Ithem with the air of a fanatic. In
-1 deed, the gist of his arguments were
| that a belief or a truth is not in j
! itself a force.
j "We are mistaken when we be
i lieve that the voice of the people is i
| the voice of God. I ask you if it
j was the voice of God manifesting
j itself in the people of ten nations
I when the treaty of Versailles was
! drawn up?"
Attacks Education
| Describing our problem as prin
j cipally one of education, Sir Norman
] pointed out that opinions which al-
I ter facts remain uneducated, where
j as opinions which do not alter facts,
| such as those about the shape of the
| earth or the movement of the stars
Jin their courses, are severely cor-
I reeled. A dissemination among the
j laymen of elementary economic
I principles would do as much toward
I helping the situation as a dissemi
j nation of the elementary facts of
| medicine have done in improving
! public health. Opinions about eco
| nomics are dangerous if they are
| untrue.
In all, his was a ruthless attack
j upon modern education. He quoted
' William James as saying that the
j professors stand in the way of
knowledge.
"They feel it a reflection on their
dignity if their subject is so simple
! that any damned fool can under
stand what it is all about."
Amends Statement
Angell amended this statement,
j remarking that the professor's job
was to find truth, which is not al
j ways simple; but that there was no
i reason why the elementary facts
| should not be common property.
