# Economist Keller Sees New Legal Philosophy
## 
### FRANCIS HAMILTON 
j A completely new legal philosophy |
i is around the corner for the United
States, believes Phillip Keller, the
(young, dark-haired acting professor
i of economics who came here from j
| the College uf the City of New York. ,
"The Supreme Court has more re- j
gard for public welfare than for
I antiquated notions of constitutional
law, and there is a strong reason to
i believe they will uphold the consti
tutionality of National Recovery
legislation."
To Keller, the NRA has innumer
; able possibilities but it is impracti
cal; he thinks America may go on
j to state socialism or fascism.
These would not be such radical
| changes from the present situation
las we are inclined lo think; the dif
ference b(m11:' a mailer of business I

in government or government in
business.
The economist sees the NBA as an
attempt to revive prosperity, in the
confusion of which a number of
sociological changes slipped in that
a year ago seemed either due only
in the far, too distant, or perilously
close, future.
"There might have been an up
heaval," said he, "and then we know
not what the results would have
been. It might be another Russia or
even what prevails in Germany."
Keller sees an ironic situation ex
isting among strikers and farmers
protesting the NR/\ as inadequate
aid.
"They are violating the very same
criminal syndicalism law which
they, themselves, drew up 10 years
a<',o against militant labor leaders.'"
