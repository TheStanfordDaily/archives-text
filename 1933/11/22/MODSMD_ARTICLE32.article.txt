# What of the Drum?
## 
### 
Students who trek lo the A.S.S.I'. Ollicc in the Old
I nion see in the lohhv an old painted barrel with some
sagging leather strapped to each end. Many discover that
a peculiar dull noise can be made by heating the leather.
What many students do not realize is that this sorry
spectacle in the corner is the "Famous Stanford Drum,"
neither famous nor faintly attached to Stanford, and most
assuredly not a drum. What students do not see are the
stalwart Scalper members who once made a fuss about
guarding the drum. Who exactly wanted the drum was
never very clear.
We still have Scalpers. We still have the remains of
the drum. Nothing much can be done about the drum be
cause the splendid war chant that once went with it has
disappeared from popular use. The Scalpers are now left
.'in honor society without anything to do. That does not
distinguish them from many other honoraries. They are
distinguished for they do not have anything to even talk
about.
We sincerely suggest to the Kx Committee that they
buy something for the Scalpers to watch. Nothing is more
sorrowful than guardians with nothing to guard.
