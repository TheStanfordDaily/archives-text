### 
News came out of Chicago this week that a scourge of
amoebic dysentery has been prevalent in the city and dur
ing the duration of the Fair, 1(1 people succumbed and ill
others, mostly visitors, contracted the disease.
Ollicials of the town said that work had continued along
preventative lines while the "epidemic" was gaining foot
hold but that all publicity on the matter had been withheld
for tear attendance at A Century of Progress would drop.
So the exposition carried the moniker of A Century of
Progress. What was the matter, was it traveling incognito?
You can't tell us that it's taken a century for people to be
attracted by hootchy-kootcby dancers, sideshow freaks,
complicated machinery (of all kinds) and all of the other
drawing cards that proved P. T. Parnum's remark.
Probably, the cynics will say the Daily is trying to make
mountains out of molehills, but we retort that Chicago
public health authorities neariv put themselves on Ihc spot
with their nonsense.
