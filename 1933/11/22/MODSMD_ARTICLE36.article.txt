FOOTIJGHT PARADE (Warners)
At the Stanford Theatre
This illegitimate grandchild of
1 "Forty-Second Street" is indubitably
I one of the most amazing pictures
I ever filmed. It is amazing in con
ception and in execution. It shows
j what the movies can do if they
really set their minds to it. And
they have set their minds to it —
this drammer is the combined re
sult of all the supervisory minds,
all the stage effects, all the chorus
i girl figures, all the singers' voices,
and all the actors' acting in Holly
j wood. If you get what I mean.
The great surprise in the show is
I that about half-way through it de
velops—of all things—a plot; but it
is so weighty as to make up for
lost time: i.e., James Cagney, as a
revue director, must devise three
complete prologues in as many days,
if he is to get the contract from a
j gentleman by the name of Pluto or
j Appolinaris or Sarsaparilla or some
i thing. (N.8.: he gets it.)
i You would haidly believe that
j Ruby Keeler (the cutie!) could be
so clever and versatile as in this
film. She starts out as a steno (I
believe the term is) who is "all busi
( ness," and then "sick of looking like
! a school teacher," she undergoes a
that would be the
envy of many a skilled actress. She
shows here real versatility by ap
i pearing in rapid succession (a) as a

white kitten, (b) as a simpering
newlywed, (c) under all manner of
water, (d) with the slanting eyes of
Shanghai Lil, and (e) in the cytest
sailor outfit you ever saw. To boot,
she sings and dances. (Ye?, to boot.)
But La Keeler is not outdone by
M. Cagney, who sings, dances, cap
tivates the women, and creates
dances with his usual fine Italian
hand.
But it is a show like this that
brings out the inadequacies of a re
viewer's vocabulary; what can you
say about numbers like "By a
Waterfall" and "Shanghai Lil?"
Nothing.
The waterfall number, ostensibly
staged as a theatre prologue, gives
you a swimming pool the size of the
Grand Central Station, a waterfall
not unlike Coney Island, and fish
eye views of the chorus.
But the Shanghai Lil number (the
tune smelling badly of "Crying for
the Carolines") is the piece de re
sistance, what with the flag (Old
Glory, I suppose I should say),
President Roosevelt, and the Blue
Eagle—all tossed of! by the U.S.
Navy chorus.
Joan Blondell's heroism, Frank
McHugh's whines, and Dick Powell's
singing are all you would expect,
but Paul Porcasi should really be
ashamed of his belches: they simply
aren't in it with Lionel Barrymore
and Wallace Beery. —Chapin
