# BULL SESSION
## WHAT PRICE ART? 
### 
( Contrast is always stimulating. |
sometimes pleasing. Stanford is full
of it. Rough and Smoothie, Ford
j and Packard, Interested Profs and
Dull Students, Dull Profs and In-
I terested Students. Contrast, in its
j highest or lowest form, is found
I near the lower end of languid
i Lasuen.
| The English corner teems with all
manner of Stanford life—herbivores,
|
j carnivores, freshmen. And across
the road stands the Art Gallery—
I solemn, austere, deserted. By com
mon consent the Gallery is a thing
1 to be avoided: even the Class of '37
I has learned that. And it is not that
| they love the .Cit Library more, but
I that there is less compulsion to
' drive them through Ihe swinging
! doors of artistry.
I Some few do push into that mau
| soleum of pictures. They are re
warded: with color, with grace, with
i "Constance of Beverly." But today
I the occasional Stanfordian who de- ,
j serts the mob to feed the soul is
j disappointed. Art for art's sake is I
| contaminated.
In with the current collection of !
; etchings. Mammon has wriggled his
j oily way. The price list, commonly
reserved for vegetable market or
'speakeasy, stands triumphantly
i alongside Gene Kloss' drawings.
: "Penitents" are on sale for $8;
i "Apache Jim," who never worried
himself about cognizartce, let alone
I repentance, sits wearily on the auc
' tion block—ready to be wrapped up
I and taken home for $5.
Immediately, to the inexperienced
observer of art—which includes the
' mass of Stanford men and women,
I the "Santo Domingo Corn Dance" is
| three times as artistic as "Desert
| Clouds." The menu says so. And
| "Three Indians" are just as fine as
, the booming "Rhythm of Tom-tom."
j Market value not mental worth be
' comes the scale of "artistic" meas
i urement.
Important is the fact that the dis
: play of "art" descends to the same
level of the display of tripe and pigs
knuckles. Artists who protest that
man is too material, that he would
| rather eat a large portion of corned
beef and cabbage than drink in the
beauties of Nature, are undoubtedly
correct. Artists who insist that
j tickets be fastened on art objects

[are contributing to this regrettable
! weakness.
The practical person will say:
"Well, artists must eat"; and equally
practical, we reply that price tags
of pictures might well be kept in
the "office of the building." The
j price of beans is important. The
price of art is disgusting.
