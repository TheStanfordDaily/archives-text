Donning our horn-rimmed specs
and checkered overcoat, we rubber
soled it over to tho soccer field the
other day to give tiie boys the once
over. Much has been rumored about
a team that, starting .slowly, has be
come about the class of Northern
California and we figured that the
matter demanded investigation.
The first bit of dope that fell to
our straining ears was that if Stan
ford takes San Mateo tomorrow, ihe
boys will be tied with S.F.U. for
the Conference championship.
Harry Maloney, genial soccer
coach, hopes to arrange a playoff
(if the boys win tomorrow) and
since Stanford outplayed and out
scored the Dons in their most re
cent game, the title may return
to the Farm from where it was
stolen last year.
Our nose for news stiffened when
we saw workmen putting up new
bleachers around the soccer fit Id. A
bit of sniffing and we had it. Stan
ford is playing California on the
morning of the Big Game, and
alumni should swell the soccer
crowd to something goodly. It wili
be the last game of the California
series (Stanford having won the first
two, 1 to 0 and j to 1) and the In
dian squad will contain no man who
has ever played on a losing team
against the Bears.
The office pup jogged up just
then with the real dope on Stan
ford's evolution this season. At
the start of practice, Maloney was
faced with a dilemuu as had as
Thornhill's backfield one. The
soccer squad contained the two
best center halfbacks in the
league, two of the best center for
wards, three other bright young
halfs, no first-class fullbacks, and
two good goalies.
Whereupon Maloney set to work.
Johnny Moore installed at
center-half and his co-star, Doug
Kennedy, obligingly became ineli
gible. That left Rudy Gonzales,
Waddy White, and Johnny Hitch
cock for the other two halfback po
sitions. Gonzales, nothing a year ago
and one of the best right now,
earned the righ half berth and
White, a regular last year, retained
his job in spite of the Hitchcock
threat.
In the forward line, Art Hearn
and Cy Johnson were star centers
but neither could play any other
place in the line. A couple of
weeks of practice, and Maloney
suddenly made a fullback of John
son. The change was startling,
but gave Stanford a left fullback
who lias been the best in the
league this season.
Captain Carl Knecht, after unsuc

cessful attempts at becoming an in
side, was reinstated at outside left,
where he is playing his third year
of all-Conference soccer. With
Johnson moved back, Hearn was the
undisputed center.
But Maloijey's troubles had only
started, he needed two insides and
jan outside right. Sven Doddington,
Mike Gomez, Charlie Emerick, Win
nie Weaver, A1 Navarro (until it
was learned that he was an ineligi
ble transfer), Bud Krebs, Knecht—
all were used to fill these positions.
Maloney even switched Moore to
inside and White to center-half,
| White to outside, but no combina
tion clicked.
Meanwhile tho team had been
tying all its games. White was in
-1 jured and Hitchcock got his job;
Dick Strouse had won the right
fullback job from Rod Lewis, Hob
Smithcrs, and Pete Peck.
Then Kennedy returned, and Ma
loney shoved Moore up to the for
ward line again and Doug played
center-half. But the combination
: was rotten. During the half of the
i first California game, Moore and
Kennedy switched positions, and this
little change made the Stanford soc
cer team. Kennedy's aggression and
soccer smartness has made a for
ward line where none grew before.
Doddington won the outside
right position from Krebs, and Go
mez became inside left. There is
the line: built around Art Hearn
and including Knecht, Gomez,
Hearn, Kennedy, and Doddington.
j Moore and Gonzales and Hitchcock
I became Moore and Gonzales and
White when Hitchcock became
Moore and Gonzales and White
when Hitchock, in turn, was injured
and White.stepped in to regain 1932
i form and become one of the team's
brightest lights in recent games.
Hitchcock, incidentally, is a better
halfback than many a regular on
past Stanford and other Conference
i teams: it is his misfortune to play
on a good team whose greatest
strength is its fullback line.
Thus it is that Stanford started
slowly but has begun to roll. It was
not until the season was half over
that the combination was found. As
the sun sank and practice ended,
Oscar yelped and wc disguised our
selves. Result: on one knew us any
; way. -.-Hamilton

Maloney even switched Moore to
inside and White to center-half,
| White to outside, but no combina
tion clicked.
Meanwhile tho team had been
tying all its games. White was in
-1 jured and Hitchcock got his job;
Dick Strouse had won the right
fullback job from Rod Lewis, Hob
Smithcrs, and Pete Peck.
Then Kennedy returned, and Ma
loney shoved Moore up to the for
ward line again and Doug played
center-half. But the combination
: was rotten. During the half of the
i first California game, Moore and
Kennedy switched positions, and this
little change made the Stanford soc
cer team. Kennedy's aggression and
soccer smartness has made a for
ward line where none grew before.
Doddington won the outside
right position from Krebs, and Go
mez became inside left. There is
the line: built around Art Hearn
and including Knecht, Gomez,
Hearn, Kennedy, and Doddington.
j Moore and Gonzales and Hitchcock
I became Moore and Gonzales and
White when Hitchcock became
Moore and Gonzales and White
when Hitchock, in turn, was injured
and White.stepped in to regain 1932
i form and become one of the team's
brightest lights in recent games.
Hitchcock, incidentally, is a better
halfback than many a regular on
past Stanford and other Conference
i teams: it is his misfortune to play
on a good team whose greatest
strength is its fullback line.
Thus it is that Stanford started
slowly but has begun to roll. It was
not until the season was half over
that the combination was found. As
the sun sank and practice ended,
Oscar yelped and wc disguised our
selves. Result: on one knew us any
; way. -.-Hamilton
Donning our horn-rimmed specs
and checkered overcoat, we rubber
soled it over to tho soccer field the
other day to give tiie boys the once
over. Much has been rumored about
a team that, starting .slowly, has be
come about the class of Northern
California and we figured that the
matter demanded investigation.
The first bit of dope that fell to
our straining ears was that if Stan
ford takes San Mateo tomorrow, ihe
boys will be tied with S.F.U. for
the Conference championship.
Harry Maloney, genial soccer
coach, hopes to arrange a playoff
(if the boys win tomorrow) and
since Stanford outplayed and out
scored the Dons in their most re
cent game, the title may return
to the Farm from where it was
stolen last year.
Our nose for news stiffened when
we saw workmen putting up new
bleachers around the soccer fit Id. A
bit of sniffing and we had it. Stan
ford is playing California on the
morning of the Big Game, and
alumni should swell the soccer
crowd to something goodly. It wili
be the last game of the California
series (Stanford having won the first
two, 1 to 0 and j to 1) and the In
dian squad will contain no man who
has ever played on a losing team
against the Bears.
The office pup jogged up just
then with the real dope on Stan
ford's evolution this season. At
the start of practice, Maloney was
faced with a dilemuu as had as
Thornhill's backfield one. The
soccer squad contained the two
best center halfbacks in the
league, two of the best center for
wards, three other bright young
halfs, no first-class fullbacks, and
two good goalies.
Whereupon Maloney set to work.
Johnny Moore installed at
center-half and his co-star, Doug
Kennedy, obligingly became ineli
gible. That left Rudy Gonzales,
Waddy White, and Johnny Hitch
cock for the other two halfback po
sitions. Gonzales, nothing a year ago
and one of the best right now,
earned the righ half berth and
White, a regular last year, retained
his job in spite of the Hitchcock
threat.
In the forward line, Art Hearn
and Cy Johnson were star centers
but neither could play any other
place in the line. A couple of
weeks of practice, and Maloney
suddenly made a fullback of John
son. The change was startling,
but gave Stanford a left fullback
who lias been the best in the
league this season.
Captain Carl Knecht, after unsuc

cessful attempts at becoming an in
side, was reinstated at outside left,
where he is playing his third year
of all-Conference soccer. With
Johnson moved back, Hearn was the
undisputed center.
But Maloijey's troubles had only
started, he needed two insides and
jan outside right. Sven Doddington,
Mike Gomez, Charlie Emerick, Win
nie Weaver, A1 Navarro (until it
was learned that he was an ineligi
ble transfer), Bud Krebs, Knecht—
all were used to fill these positions.

then with the real dope on Stan
ford's evolution this season. At
the start of practice, Maloney was
faced with a dilemuu as had as
Thornhill's backfield one. The
soccer squad contained the two
best center halfbacks in the
league, two of the best center for
wards, three other bright young
halfs, no first-class fullbacks, and
two good goalies.
Whereupon Maloney set to work.
Johnny Moore installed at
center-half and his co-star, Doug
Kennedy, obligingly became ineli
gible. That left Rudy Gonzales,
Waddy White, and Johnny Hitch
cock for the other two halfback po
sitions. Gonzales, nothing a year ago
and one of the best right now,
earned the righ half berth and
White, a regular last year, retained
his job in spite of the Hitchcock
threat.
In the forward line, Art Hearn
and Cy Johnson were star centers
but neither could play any other
place in the line. A couple of
weeks of practice, and Maloney
suddenly made a fullback of John
son. The change was startling,
but gave Stanford a left fullback
who lias been the best in the
league this season.
Captain Carl Knecht, after unsuc

cessful attempts at becoming an in
side, was reinstated at outside left,
where he is playing his third year
of all-Conference soccer. With
Johnson moved back, Hearn was the
undisputed center.
But Maloijey's troubles had only
started, he needed two insides and
jan outside right. Sven Doddington,
Mike Gomez, Charlie Emerick, Win
nie Weaver, A1 Navarro (until it
was learned that he was an ineligi
ble transfer), Bud Krebs, Knecht—
all were used to fill these positions.
Maloney even switched Moore to
inside and White to center-half,
| White to outside, but no combina
tion clicked.
Meanwhile tho team had been
tying all its games. White was in
-1 jured and Hitchcock got his job;
Dick Strouse had won the right
fullback job from Rod Lewis, Hob
Smithcrs, and Pete Peck.
Then Kennedy returned, and Ma
loney shoved Moore up to the for
ward line again and Doug played
center-half. But the combination
: was rotten. During the half of the
i first California game, Moore and
Kennedy switched positions, and this
little change made the Stanford soc
cer team. Kennedy's aggression and
soccer smartness has made a for
ward line where none grew before.
Doddington won the outside
right position from Krebs, and Go
mez became inside left. There is
the line: built around Art Hearn
and including Knecht, Gomez,
Hearn, Kennedy, and Doddington.
j Moore and Gonzales and Hitchcock
I became Moore and Gonzales and
White when Hitchcock became
Moore and Gonzales and White
when Hitchock, in turn, was injured
and White.stepped in to regain 1932
i form and become one of the team's
brightest lights in recent games.
Hitchcock, incidentally, is a better
halfback than many a regular on
past Stanford and other Conference
i teams: it is his misfortune to play
on a good team whose greatest
strength is its fullback line.
Thus it is that Stanford started
slowly but has begun to roll. It was
not until the season was half over
that the combination was found. As
the sun sank and practice ended,
Oscar yelped and wc disguised our
selves. Result: on one knew us any
; way. -.-Hamilton
Donning our horn-rimmed specs
and checkered overcoat, we rubber
soled it over to tho soccer field the
other day to give tiie boys the once
over. Much has been rumored about
a team that, starting .slowly, has be
come about the class of Northern
California and we figured that the
matter demanded investigation.
The first bit of dope that fell to
our straining ears was that if Stan
ford takes San Mateo tomorrow, ihe
boys will be tied with S.F.U. for
the Conference championship.
Harry Maloney, genial soccer
coach, hopes to arrange a playoff
(if the boys win tomorrow) and
since Stanford outplayed and out
scored the Dons in their most re
cent game, the title may return
to the Farm from where it was
stolen last year.
Our nose for news stiffened when
we saw workmen putting up new
bleachers around the soccer fit Id. A
bit of sniffing and we had it. Stan
ford is playing California on the
morning of the Big Game, and
alumni should swell the soccer
crowd to something goodly. It wili
be the last game of the California
series (Stanford having won the first
two, 1 to 0 and j to 1) and the In
dian squad will contain no man who
has ever played on a losing team
against the Bears.
