j Over on hole-proof, walled Ed-
I wards Field, California's coach. Bill
Ingram, is doing big things with the
j varsity this week. No news corre- (
tspondents are admitted, but occa-
Jsional ::)ips of news are issued by
j the University's director of pub- I
j licity.
Yesterday's mite: Bill Ingram is
making a quarterback of Frank
Walker, hitherto a fullback substi
tute. The reason is that a husky
blocking back is needed to floor the
Stanford ends, A1 Norgard and Jim
1 Moscrip.
Work for Backs
That means harder work for the :
| left halfbacks, Arleigh Williams and 1
l Floyd Blower, who in addition to |
j ball carrying, kicking, and passing, i
1 must call signals as well. It adds
to the trend this season of signal
; calling ball carriers,
Bobby Grayson, Stanford's ball
! packer in the Trojan game,' calls ,
j the signals, as does Irv Warburton, i
; the demon Southern California j
J quarterback.
! The setup for the Bear backfield
'is Williams or Blower at left half;
| Ken Mueller, right half; Jim Keefer,
J fullback.
"Rolling Now"
I Besides making sudden changes,
I the Bear mentor added a few per
jsonal observations. "We're rolling?
now. We'll be at our best for the
Big Game. We'll be tough."
Of the Rose Bowl game he said:
"We want that game as badly as
Stanford wants it. And if we win J
the Big Game I believe we will have '
earned it. Let the Rose Bowl be the
Big Game side-stakes. That will
suit us fine."
