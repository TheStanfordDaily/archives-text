Here's a new one in football. It took the Oregon team, leaders in the
Pacific Coast conference, by surprise in their game with Oregon State
college. Photo shows Devine, Oregon State's big center, being hoisted
into the air by team mates to block Oregon's kick for the point after
touchdown. The ball struck Devine on the chest as he rocketed upward
to block the try. Oregon won, however, 13 to 3. (Associated Press Photo)
