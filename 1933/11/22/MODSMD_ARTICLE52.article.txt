# STANFORD VARSITY SOCCERMEN MEET SAN MATEO TODAY
## 
### Joe Lanidrac 
The last obstacle standing between
the Stanford soccer varsity and a
tie for Conference championship
will probably be swept away by 22
swinging" feet tomorrow afternoon
when the Indian soccermen, now in
second place in the league, face the
San Mateo Bulldogs, in fourth place,
in a playoff. Such a prospective vic
tory will land the Cardinal varsity ;
on the top rung of the Conference
ladder where now totters the pow
erful S.F.U. Don squad, which will
have to be knocked off in a cham
pionship battle if Stanford is to take
the first place laurels.
Follows Tie
The San Mateo contest follows a
1 to 1 tie game af .some weeks ago
when darkness so blanketed the
field that the game became a treas
ure hunt and was called prema
turely. Since then the Redmen have
clicked pretty well, twice defeating
the California Bears and once hu
miliating the Dons.
With the chance for the league
championship hanging iij balance
Coach Harry Maloney will start his
first-string line-up which played the
entire last California game unsub
stitufed and which damaged the
Dons so. The forward line, stretch
ing out on either side of the star
j center forward, Art Hearn, will be
relied upon to do more damage to
I San Mateo than before. Captain
Carl Knecht, who scored one of the
j two untouched corner kicks of the
! 1933 season, will.be relied upon to [
J lead the offense.
Defense Is Strong
Powerful is Stanlord's defense, the
| fear of San Mateo's offense getting
on a scoring spree is somewhat out,
J even with the practical certainty j
| that Milt Newman will be called in
: to replace Jack King at goal, and
that Johnny Hitchcock will take !
i Rudy Gonzales' position at right i
; half after sundown.
j The line-up is to be: forwards,
j Knecht, Gomez, Hearn, Kennedy,
iDoddington; halfbacks, White, Gon
l zales, Moore; fullbacks, Strouse and
j Johnson; goalie, King.
