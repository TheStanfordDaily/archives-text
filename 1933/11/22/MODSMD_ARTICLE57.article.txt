### 
j Candidly appreciative of demon
! strative, sizeable Stanford audiences,
Sir Norman Angell last night
j evinced Complete approval of the
"farm" in general and its viewpoint
j in particular.
A Cambridge group, he remarked,
would probably have been half as
I large, laughed less, and criticized
i more. "Stanford," said Angell dryly,
"is very enjoyable to address"—than
which his conservative British praise
j could go no further.
The fame of Angell—pronounced
i angel, not angle—as a speaker is
| probably only surpassed by his re
; nown as a writer. Remarks he: that
writing may educate the reader, but
! that speaking sometimes turns out
to be embarrassing! educational to
j the lecturer.
The Stanford audience, he consid
j ered, grasped points quickly; too
< quickly, in fact. Angell remarked
guilelessly at one place in his dis
course that far too often the wrong
traits in individuals are appreciated
notably those in public office, and
| illustrated with the statement that
I instead of desiring goodness, the
| modern maid had to be clever to
j remain good. Result: prompt, glee
ful, misinterpretation by audience —
, hearty and delighted guffaws.
Citizenship, that pitfall of all
freshmen, is to be lauded. He con
siders Americans, and persons
; everywhere, are far too apt to know
too much and think too little—that
; the ability to interpret problems
exceeds in importance knowledge of
the problems themselves.
