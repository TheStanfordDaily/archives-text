# CARDS IN FINE MENTAL SHAPE FOR BIG GAME
## Team Undismayed By Poor Showing in Contest With Montana INGRAM LAUDS BACKS "Beat Those Guys," Motto On Eve of Tilt 
### Spud Hamilton 
No mental set of over or under !
confidence is going to catch the j
Stanford Indian and throw him off '
his winning stride. Superior man
j power, the breaks of the game, or j
better football may decide the Big;
Game winner, but it will not be ,
1 psychology, at least from the Stan- j
ford end.
This has become increasingly ap- ;
parent, as the varsity steams into 1
its final week of the season, in bet- !
j ter mental condition than it has ever j
| been before a Big Game. Anyway, [
i that is the consensus of the old j
; grads and interested bugs who j
gather nightly in the varsity prac- !
| tice field's shroud of fog.
Montana Game Bad
Despite Coach Bill Ingi'am's glow- ;
j ing description of the Stanford team
in action last Saturday, which he j
repeated for the benefit of his squad
over in Berkeley, the Cardinals j
know they played sloppy ball against j
Montana. But they attribute that to )
relaxation after ihqjr brilliant de- |
feat of U.S.C., and are sure they ]
will do better under pressure next" j
Saturday.
They know California has a great j
squad of powerful men, playing a j
tricky offense, and ready to fight the '
j game out on the basis of defense. ;
They know they are ready to match
their stubborn defensive line against
| all the speed of ihe Stanford back- i
' field, and all the power of the Stan- i
ford line.
"Beat Those Guys"
But nevertheless, they quietly as-
I sume that they can "beat those \
I guys," and go on to play the Rose
I Bowl game unhampered. Every
1 night of practice brings out more
clearly their attitude, with Bobby
Grayson, Bob Hamilton, Jack Hill- !
man, et al., galloping around the
j ends and shouting to Bill Corbus,
Woody Adams, Frank Alustiza, et !
! al., to "smack those guys down!"
"cut in!" and "get the safety!"
Coach Thornhill appears to be
| definitely decided on Wes Muller as
his starting man nt center; the left
half position remains questionable,
with the chances that more experi
enced Bob Maentz will get the call
over Buck Van Deilen, who has been
a blaze of speed in the last three
games.
