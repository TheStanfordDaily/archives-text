Bank of America is as California!! as the sun
shine. It is of and by and for all California. It
especially favors no single community —is not
provincial in attitude—it plays no favorites,
rises above sectionalism and endeavors to
advance the general good of the entire state.
Bank of America appeals to its vast and
ever-increasing patronage because of this
democratic, broad-minded, all-California
viewpoint.
Your funds placed with this institution be
come immediately active in the development
of California as a whole.
