"WHEN A FELLER
MEEDS A FRIEND"
0 . . Briggs is the friend he needs!
A handsome half hack may steal your girl
friend . . . hut nothing can take away the
joy you get from mellow old BRIGGS.
You could pay twice as much for a
tobacco . . . and find it not half so good as
BRIGGS. Aged in the wood extra long
. . . BRIGGS is mellow, fragrant and
biteless.
* .
But BRfGGS won its great popularity by
talking in pipes . . . not print. Won't you
give it a trial and let it speak for itself?
BRIGGS Pipe Mixture is also sold in 1-pound and
!j-pound tins . . . and in 1-pound Humidor Kegs.
