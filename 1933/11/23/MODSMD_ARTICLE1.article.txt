## Sprague Rebound 
### 
Yesterday the sun rose and the
birds sang as Treasury Secretary
Morganthau had predicted, but U.S.
bonds sank, military rule entered
his department. Caustically, re
signing finance expert Sprague pre
dicted collapse of government credit
if inflation were pursued, therefore
impossibility of floating necessaiy
bonds to finance Nit A and PWA
expenditures.
Piqued by F.R.s inattention,
Sprague set off a bigger cannon
cracker than he had reckoned. First
result is announced U.S. policy of
buying its bonds to support sagging
market. Then treasury employees
have been gagged, can make no pub
lic statements save through their
chief; guards must "show respect
for official superiors," stand at at
tention when spoken to.

Reacting at oncc to the Sprague
Mast, G.O.P.'s and Dcms. orated,
took expected sides. Ailing Sec.
Woodin struck back, lambasted the
Professor, implied he was slightly
non compos, thus proved his loyalty
to F.R.
Yesterday's gold price stuck at
$33.76, world price soared to $34.41,
dollar zigzagged crazily* all day,
closed up a few points. Significant
point: brakes applied, to gaining
gaining dollar has slowed up, as per
F.R. schedule. Question: Can he
keep it up?
