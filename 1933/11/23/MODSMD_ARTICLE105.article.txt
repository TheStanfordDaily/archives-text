the stratosphere. He is shown (center) inside the tiny globular gondola which was loaded with supplies
ranging from bananas to cosmic ray meters and female fruit flies. His companion was Major Chester
Fordney (right) of the marine corps, who had never gone up in a balloon. At left is the inflated bag o#
