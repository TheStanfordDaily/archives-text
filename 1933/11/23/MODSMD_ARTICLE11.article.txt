(Julitor's Aolr. I his is the f'mirth and last of a scries of special articles
tracuii/ the luslory of the Stanford A.ve.)

In the solemn shadows of the Stan
ford Mausoleum the conspirators
met. It was 4:30 o'clock in the after
noon of Thursday, April 3, 1930, and
the 21 serious-faced students had a
quest to perform that was to make
this day famous in the history of
Stanford tradition. For 31 years Cal
ifornia had celebrated her Axe Rally,
and the band of Sequoians was de
termined that night's would be the
last.
The story of the capture of the Axe
by Stanford has been told and re
told. Even the senior of today who
was somewhere in high school when
it happened has heard of the cam
era ruse which publicity - hungry
California guards fell for.
"Give us a good shot at the Axe,"
begged intrepid Stanford roughs
from the rumble scat of the ear
where fake photographic equipment

| was rigged up. As unsuspecting Axe
| custodian Norm Horner climbed out
of the bullet-proof armored car, the
j California guards fell back for the
picture, and Stanfordite Howard
Avery dropped upon him from the
auto's roof.
It was all over in a moment, so
1 carefully were the strategic move
ments worked out by the "21." A
well-placed tear bomb, the blade
concealed under Bob Loofbourow's
. sweater on its way home in a speed
! ing car, and the cry of "Let's go to
the Campanile and organize a pur
| suit party!" yelled by Stanford men
. in a successful effort to throw the
crowd oft the scent.
News of the Axe's arrival spread
like wildfire. The campus staged a
celebration that turned every stu
dent inmate of Hall, Row, and Palo
Alto into a cheering fanatic.
