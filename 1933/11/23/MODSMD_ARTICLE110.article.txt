Plans for smoother, more efficient
handling of hungry, thirsty Big
Game crowds were presented to the
concession stand managers by Chief
O. H. Tucker and Assistants Bill
Morse and A1 Cronkite late last

Twenty-six stands, outside the
gates, just inside and on the rim,
will be ready for patrons no matter
how early they come. Each one will
be in the charge of a stand manager
trained to best serve the customers.
Assisted by approximately a hun
dred men, the managers will be
prepared to provide fast, efficient
service in dishing out soda pop, ice
cream, candy, cigars, cigarettes,
matches, information, and chewing
gum.
Since the weather man has pre
dicted a warm day, the quantities of
cold drinks and ice cream necessary
to feed 80 or 90 thousand football
fans will be enormous. One item in
particular, chocolate - coated ice
cream on sticks, a great favorite
with grid fans, runs up to 18,000 es
pecially made for Big Game con
sumption.
Says Chief Tucker that in spite of
a supposedly depressed financial
year more men are being employed
on the concession end of the game
than in several years past.
