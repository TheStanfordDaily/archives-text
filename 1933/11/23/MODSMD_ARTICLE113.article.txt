# Germany Unfitted for War, Observes Noted Authority
## 
### 
Germany, outwardly belligerent
and ready for a fight, will not de
clare war, says William Hard, jour
nalistic authority on international
affairs, in an interview in the Daily
Californian.
"The United States may enjoy its
nightly sleep for several months at
least," the commentator remarked,
adding "that arms limitations im
posed on Germany made her un
fitted to carry on a war at the pres
ent time."
He warned, however, of the "po
litical brain trust" of professors and
others involved in recovery projects,
stating that the N.R.A. program is
one of the greatest difficulties that
ever confronted the American
people.
