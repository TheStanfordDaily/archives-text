# Messimer Issues Calls For Concert Series Tryoutees
## 
### 
Bright young men who want to get
ahead in the coid, cruel world are
advised by Prentice Messimer, man- j
ager of the Concert Series, to drop
in at his office and offer their serv
ices to this growing business.
A good chance to work up to a
salaried position is offered to hard
working freshmen and sophomores.
Students desiring to tryout will
meet next Tuesday at 7:30 o'clock
in the Concert Series office in the
old Union. '
