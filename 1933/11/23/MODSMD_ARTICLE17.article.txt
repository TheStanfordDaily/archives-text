# Big Game "Pelican" Out At Univ. of California
## 
### 
Diffusing California spirit with ev
ery sweep of its broad wings, the
Big Game issue of the California
"Pelican" swoops over the Berkeley
campus this week. Managers of the
Polly are overexuberant about the
great market for the humor sheet,
as the first issue sold out by noon of
the first day.
