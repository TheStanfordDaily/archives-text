# Lynching Coming Up
## 
### 
Angry restless crowds surged
about San Jose's ancient bastille
yesterday. Many spoke of a possi
ble lynching. Cause for this lies in
announced intention of determined
Sheriff Emig to bring self-confessed
murderers Thurmond and Holmes to
the county jail from S.F.
Experienced observers feel that
Ibis latest move will turn into a
battle of wits between vigilantes and
.sheriff's aides. Meanwhile Federal
Grand Jury indicted Hart kidnap
pers on potent using-mails to de
fraud charge. U.S. Navy will assist
in dragging bay, Federal sleuths still
comb bay region, several more sus
pects are being trailed.
