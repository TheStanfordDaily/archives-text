Shrieking, whistling, stamping,
four thousand hysterical Indians

feet as it was brought in, newly
mounted, by two of the Commit

covered the trophy from Califor
nia.
The Axe Yell, most famous of
Stanford cheers, closed the rally in
a blaze of glory as men and women
rose to their feet and shrieked de
fiance at the Golden Bear.
Flares, bells, and auto horns
marked the war dance of hundreds
of automobiles down Row to the
Rally. Led by the band, the din
was accentuated by house bells and
banging exhausts.
"I was expected to give a pep
talk. That's like trying to shoot hop
in a high powered race horse—no
use in it, that's all," explained the
versatile Speegle.
A hilarious skit exposing campus
celebrities with an "angel broad
casting from a hanging chair" was
the hit of the evening as far as en
tertainment went. Speakers includ
ed Tiny Thornhill, A.S.S.U. Presi
dent Wakefield Taylor, and Trustee
