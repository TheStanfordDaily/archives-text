# Big Game Jolly-Up Rouses Spirit for Game
## 
### 
Eager, expectant of great things to
be done over the weekend, 1200
Stanford men and women thronged
the Pavilion yesterday afternoon in
the Rally Committee's annual pre-
Big Game jolly-up.
Gordon Heche's campus orchestra,
the first local group in years to be
used at the Big Game jolly-up,
furnished music, with incidental
solos and trios by members of the
orchestra. Gaieties stars also lent
their voices to the occasion as they
sang through the especially ar
ranged amplifiers.
Noticeable for its until-now rarity
at Stanford dances was a women's
stag line at the beginning of the
dance. Late - arriving roughs soon
took the situation in hand, however.
Eallyman Bill Waltman was in
charge of arrangements for the
dance, assisted by Leonore Azevedo,
Carter Meyer, B. Kellogg, and Iris
Forsyth.
