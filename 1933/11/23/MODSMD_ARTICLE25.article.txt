# Ten Cards to Face California Saturday For First Big Game
## Bill Corbus Only Man Who Has Faced Ingram's Gridders Before 
### Spud Hamilton 
Bob Maentz will start at left half,
and Wes Muller will start at center
against the Golden Bear Saturday,
Coach "Tiny" Thornhill announced
last night. This will be the same,
team that began the afternoon
against U.S.C. two weeks ago, and
it will send ten men, green in Big
Game experience, against Ingram's
men.
The only Stanford player on ihe
starting team who was in the fray
against the Bear last year is Bill
Corbus, right guard, who will prob
ably captain the team Saturday.
The varsity squad will retire to
the seclusion of tlie Lyndon Hotel
at Los Gatos Friday night, not to
appear on the campus until near
game time.
Coaches Polish
While the scalpers' price of Eig
Game tickets soared, both Coaches
Ingram and Thornhill were busy
polishing details of team play. Cali
fornia remained behind locked walls,
and Stanford right out in the open.
Ingram has announced that Cap
tain Ransome, the injured tackle,
will be in shape for the starting
assignment, and that his versatile
left half, Arleigh Williams, will be
in. Floyd Blower will remain avail
able for substitute duty.
Indians Run Plays
Stanford continued the ceaseless I
running of plays that has character
ized its scrimmage for the past two
weeks. There was no tenseness or
uneasiness in the Indian camp, but a
quiet undercurrent of confidence
prevailed.
Larry Rouble and Bill Corbus put
in long sessions at place - kicking,
and the strong possibility that the
game may be won by field goals
was current. California's Arleigh
Williams has a record of malyng
good eight conversions in eight at
tempts this season, and his place
kick against Troy put the Bears out
in front for three quarters.
Buck Van Dellen has been flash
ing this week in practice, just as
he flashed against Olympic Club,
U.S.C., and Montana. He will prob
ably get some opportunity to show \
in Saturday's game.
Thornhill's announced starting i
team disposes of three men who i
were regulars against California in 1
last year's scoreless tie. "Bashing" j
Jack Hillman is now a second string \
fullback, and Bill Sim, All-Coast j
left half of 1932, has been beaten j
from pillar to post until he has no
regular position left. Then there is |
Ted Kite, left guard who ran flashy
interference all last year, who has j
been shoved way down on the list.
On paper, the Stanford backfield
shapes up as the best, and the lines
are nearly even. Triple threat pos
sibilities at all four backfield posi
tions should give Thornhill ample
potentialities for deception and
power.
