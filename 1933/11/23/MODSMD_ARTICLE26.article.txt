### LILLIAN HURWITZ 
The swinging of (he sociological
pendulum from action to reaction
is responsible for the revival of in
terest in writers of the Victorian
era, believes English Professor Fran
ces Theresa Russell, whose latest
book, "Two Poets, a Dog, and a
Boy," is a charming tale on the
lives of the Brownings.
Speaking of the recent run of
books on the Brownings, among
which hers is prominent, she says,
"It is part of a more general Victo
rian revival. We arc getting away
from the supercilious patronizing
air of the past few years. We are
finding that the Victorians are not
so easily snubbed, and the result has
been a regular epidemic of works
on the nineteenth century."
Mrs. Russell sees no parallel in
present day reactionism in national
affairs and the Victorian literary re
turn, since nineteenth century ideas

were all of the "lai&sfcz-faire" rather
than (he Fascist variety, but she
does see the influence of modern
j economic conditions in shaping lit
erature along positive constructive
lines.
"There is a reconsideration of so
cial problems, but in a new direc
tion. Mencken passed in and out at
the appropriate moments. His task
is over."
Mrs. Russell has unplanned time
liness in her books. Last year she
had published "Touring Utopia," an
account of Utopia literature from
Plato to Aldous Huxley.
"It was purely Coincidence that it
fits in so well with the public minds
just at present. The depression has
forced people to think in public J
termsâ€”they never think at all un
less they are pushed into it by some
disaster. "Now wo are all inter
jested in a planned society."
