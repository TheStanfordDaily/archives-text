# LAWYERS PASS ON N.R.A. ACTS IN MOOT COURT
## Barbour, McElwain Given Decision Supporting Roosevelt Policy CATHCART IS JUDGE Speakers Evade Question In Involved Talks 
### Owen Ulph 
Casual spectators, inveigled inty
attending moot court last evening
by ihe thought of a prospective
bombshell bursting among ihe ranks
of goose-stepping supporters of the
N.R.A. were disappointed. Frozen
faced Judge Cathcart awarded the
decision to ihe respondents, Robert
Barbour and Letter McElwain, sup
porting the act of Congress which
made U.S. treasury notes legal ten
der for payment of all debts.
Gold Clause Argued
The ease was based on a demand
of the Equity Trust Company of
San Francisco tiiat the respondent,
Cyrus Bucklin, pay the business
$10,000 in gold coin, instead of the
treasury notes which he offered.
Robert Barbour, who closed the
case for the respondent, was out
standing, seemed to have an actual
grasp of his case, and proceeded
with force and clarity, qualities de
cidedly lacking in other barristers.
Kidwell open the case for the ap
pellant with a mouthful of over
used legal terminology which pioved
rather tedious to all those unfamiliar
with law and its formalities. With
his back to the audience and facing
the judge, Kidwell showed that the
value of gold as a medium of for
eign purchasing power was de
cidedly greater than treasury notes
and that by accepting these notes
as debt payment the company was
being chiseled.
Speakers Evasive
Colleague Fletcher followed with
the same logic-chopping, evasive
ambiguity as his predecessor. After
his timidity at the opening of his
speech, Fletcher grew more and
more emphatic and sincerely en
grossed in his case, drove across the
point that his legalization of treas
ury notes confiscated the Equity
contract without due process of law.
Lester McElwain became en
meshed in his own legal terms and
fumbled over an explanation of
"reasonable congressional action"
which had been a, stumbling block
with which Judge Cathcart had
tripped up both opponents, came out
of the spin right side up and de
nounced gold as a metal with any
intrinsic value as generally be
lieved. "A bushel of potatoes is of
more value to us than a bushel of
gold," he said, at which point every
one laughed, the first laugh of the
evening.
"While the power exercised was
extraordinary and has the effect of
depriving the creditor of valuable
right, it is within the powers ex
pressed and impliedly granted Con
gress by ihe Constitution," said
Cathcart, coming out from behind
his mystic frigid mask and standing
up for the respondents.

fumbled over an explanation of
"reasonable congressional action"
which had been a, stumbling block
with which Judge Cathcart had
tripped up both opponents, came out
of the spin right side up and de
nounced gold as a metal with any
intrinsic value as generally be
lieved. "A bushel of potatoes is of
more value to us than a bushel of
gold," he said, at which point every
one laughed, the first laugh of the
evening.
"While the power exercised was
extraordinary and has the effect of
depriving the creditor of valuable
right, it is within the powers ex
pressed and impliedly granted Con
gress by ihe Constitution," said
Cathcart, coming out from behind
his mystic frigid mask and standing
up for the respondents.
Casual spectators, inveigled inty
attending moot court last evening
by ihe thought of a prospective
bombshell bursting among ihe ranks
of goose-stepping supporters of the
N.R.A. were disappointed. Frozen
faced Judge Cathcart awarded the
decision to ihe respondents, Robert
Barbour and Letter McElwain, sup
porting the act of Congress which
made U.S. treasury notes legal ten
der for payment of all debts.
Gold Clause Argued
The ease was based on a demand
of the Equity Trust Company of
San Francisco tiiat the respondent,
Cyrus Bucklin, pay the business
$10,000 in gold coin, instead of the
treasury notes which he offered.
Robert Barbour, who closed the
case for the respondent, was out
standing, seemed to have an actual
grasp of his case, and proceeded
with force and clarity, qualities de
cidedly lacking in other barristers.
Kidwell open the case for the ap
pellant with a mouthful of over
used legal terminology which pioved
rather tedious to all those unfamiliar
with law and its formalities. With
his back to the audience and facing
the judge, Kidwell showed that the
value of gold as a medium of for
eign purchasing power was de
cidedly greater than treasury notes
and that by accepting these notes
as debt payment the company was
being chiseled.
Speakers Evasive
Colleague Fletcher followed with
the same logic-chopping, evasive
ambiguity as his predecessor. After
his timidity at the opening of his
speech, Fletcher grew more and
more emphatic and sincerely en
grossed in his case, drove across the
point that his legalization of treas
ury notes confiscated the Equity
contract without due process of law.
Lester McElwain became en
meshed in his own legal terms and
fumbled over an explanation of
