A (lampus Opinioner talks most harsltlv to the Daily
today lor printing a story about foilr Stanford students who
conceived (he unique sporl of fox-trotting in a local ceme
tery.
The Daily printed the storv with Ihc same purpose that
stories of initiates siiitÂ»'i 1144 011 My Shoulder" in a
cemetery are printed. That is to say there was no great
purpose at all.
The Daily does not look with special favor on graveyard
(Umcers. In fact, we look with disfavor on the practice. We
hope that the movement does not assume national propor
tions because the graveyard posies will he trampled. We
heartily approve of upright flowers and unmolested graves.
