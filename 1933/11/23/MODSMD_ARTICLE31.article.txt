						Raily Among Rallies

### 
The big fish in the Rolling Foothills and the liille fish
in the Hav must have heard it. It was probably the most
enthusiastic rally in years. More vigorous noise from man
and machine than ever before.
It was splendid. Three thousand students let loose their
enthusiasm. The Leaders had to keep spirit under
control; not encourage and foster it. That is as it should
be. The Student Body was genuinely excited and it ex
pressed its excitement.
The Big (lames with Cal is still the Big Game. That
statement should warm those mysterious things called the
cockles of the hearts of all the alumni.
Those who have claimed that Stanford Spirit is dead,
or even a bit decayed, were proved decidedly wrong.
It is hard to fire up with the mechanical precision of an
oil-burning steamer. Spirit is not that sort of a thing. It
jumps full grown out of the proper occasion. Last night
was a most proper occasion. Those that try to make the
student body grow spirited at call have thought the campus
dead; some said very dead.
Any intelligent campus will see the laugh in pouring
forth school spirit with the same facility as one pours cof
fee from a pot. Stanford has often laughed.
But last night was different. The spirit of the Big Game
was in the air. The old pot danced a gig, boiled over, then
blew up.
