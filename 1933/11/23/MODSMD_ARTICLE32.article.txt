Some enterprising Findcr-of-Facts has conic lo Ihe im
portant conclusion, after diligent research, that the types
o! hooks read by college students are not what they
should he.
Ihe dismaying results try to control, yourselves, fac
ulty are that college students do not enjoy reading seri
ous, lolly tomes in their spare time. The girls prefer light
liction and the hoys like to read detective stories.
The pedagogue who figured this out surely deserves a
master's, perhaps even a doctor's degree. He has opened
up a new field for moralizing propaganda. We may antici
pate a campaign hv the women's clubs, with a committee
lor every campus. I here will he pep talks by the president
ol the Anti-Vice League, and radio programs about the
reading ol worth-while hooks sponsored hy the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to College Students. Owners of
circulating libraries will be hanged in efligy, and every cam
pus will be cluttered with handbills screaming "Head Bet
ter Hooks."
For such is the nature of Homo Atnericanus: he tries to
relorm his neighbors before himself, he believes the Ten
Commandments should have a police force behind them,
and he thinks that th Italian in the ditch should he jailed
for spitting on his hands.
