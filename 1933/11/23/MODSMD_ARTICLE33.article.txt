\\ lint will you do when a gurgling grandchild climbs
upon your wcarv knee and says, "Granpa, what about Stan
ford.' What will you do when you are trapped with an
cnflnisiastie second cousin from Sioux City? What will
posterity think of you when they thumb through the Quad?
These poignant questions arc printed so that Stanford
Seniors can answer them. They are printed so that Stan
ford seniors wiil feci conscience - stricken, dread - appre
hending and speed to the Quad oflicc for their pictures.
Kvery year, three days after the Quad goes to press,
seniors rush to the Editor (this year Al Sadler), and an
nounce their willingness to pose for their pictures.
