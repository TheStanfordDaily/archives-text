Dear Sir:
I was very surprised to see that the ,
Daily published, as a good joke, the
fact that four Stanford students had
a "swell time" dancing in the Menlo
cemetery. I fail to see the humor in !
this lack of respect lor the dead and
for other people feelings.
Perhaps this disregard of a very 1

DESECRATED GRAVES

I old tradition is the way some inter
pret our motto: "Let winds of free
dom blow," but most of us are Chris
tians and the respect for the dead
is the logical result of our beliefs.
(Therefore, it merits some considera
tion.
I If such acts as the one I am dis
cussing cannot be censured, at least
we would expect our Campus Daily
not to cncourage them.
Yours,
Rosa L. Davila.
