Gentlemen:
Isn't it about time that the public
be well apprised of Stanford's cor
rect colors? When Stanford was
first established the colors were to
be red and gold—red from the tile
roofs of the building..; and the other
color for the nearest color that
would be obtainable to the stone.
In those days women folks at
tending the game wore dresses ac
cording to the side they were cheer
ing for. In other words, the women

Ifrom California wore yellow waists
and blue dresses; so the Stanford
girls would have had to wear yel
low waists and red dresses. This
they did not like and objected to.
and like good fellows the men soon
saw that they were right, and
adopted the straight red or cardinal,
ilt was only through misconception
when white sweaters were being
worn by the footb:>ll players that
many thought the colors red and
white, and now it is about time that
we all return to tho real, good old
days of the cardinal red—a danger
flag to California.
Very sincerely yours,
Sam I. Schwabaches, '07.
