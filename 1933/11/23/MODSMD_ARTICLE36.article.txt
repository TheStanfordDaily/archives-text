ALL MEN ARE ENEMIES
By Richard Aldington
Double-day, Doran, Inc., 193.*>
Richard Aldington has iong been
interested in portraying the devas
tating effects of the World War on
people who were caught in the
whirlpool of its horrors. "Death of a
Hero" told of a man killed in action.
"The Colonel's Daughter" consid
ered a girl of the same generation.
Now "All Men Are Enemies" re
lates the story of a man who sur
vived the conflict, and of his prob
lem in overcoming the spiritual
breakdown he brought home with
him.
This is most decidedly not just
another war book; in fact, the war
itself plays a very small part. It
goes farther than its predecessors
and delivers a scathing indictment
against the whole petty, common
place mode of living set up by Eng
land and Big Business and Society
after the peace treaty. Aldington,
an intense, romantic idealist, bit
terly condemns the mediocrity of his
times, the wholesale abandonment
of real beauty, the disregard of liv
ing as an end in itself. And at the
same time he creates a sublime love
story.
Tfcose with mid-Victorian lean
ings will probably find the author's
sincere frankness scandalous (as his
own countrymen have regarded
some of his earlier works—witness
the sprinkling of asterisks through
out the British edition of "Death of
a Hero"). The entirely realistic will
resent taking it on the chin, and so
will scoff: "Romantic, sentimental
bosh." But everyone who feels that
there is something missing in the
life of today, who hates its artifi
ciality and sham and repression, will
find this story of Tony and Katha
vital, stimulating, and movingly
beautiful. For such a person it will
bear the stamp of true greatness.
