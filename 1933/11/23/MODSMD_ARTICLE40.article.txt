# Grange

### 
National Grange, still meeting in
Idaho, demanded income tax in
creases in higher brackets, warned
against continuing present welfare
relief system.
They "insist" upon broadening tax
base, continue to assail tax evasion,
and generally repeat demands, ulti
matums, suggestions, and sublimated
wishes of past 20 years.
