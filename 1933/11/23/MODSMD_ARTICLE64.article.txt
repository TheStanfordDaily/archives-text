# Campaign to Raise Row Scholarship Under Way
## 
### 
In order to avoid possible failure
in scholarship, and to guard against
health troubles of the women, the
scholarship committee composed of
representative women from all the
campus living groups, headed by
Adrienne Hawkins, has started a
campaign.
The group has recently organized
to gather suggestions as to how the
women's scholarship and health may
benefit.
Plans have been made to have one
representative from each sorority
and several halls, to meet in small
groups for the purpose of discussing
any suggestions that may be made.
Representatives from the small
groups will later meet in an all
campus group.
