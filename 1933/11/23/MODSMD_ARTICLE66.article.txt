# Cross Country Men Point for U. C. Invasion
## 
### 
Stanford cross - country runners
are tapering off and ready for the
California invasion at the Indian golf
course Saturday morning.
The cross-country race, carried on
as a minor sport, will give Coach
Dink Templeton his first glimpse of
Bear track strength. The California
squad is expected to be much better
than that of last year.
Norm Bright, outstanding two
miler, but ineligible for track com
petition next spring, will lead the
Stanford contingent. Dave Devlin
and Art Azevedo, two - milers;
Chuck Njmmo, miler, and Sam East
man, graduate half-miler, are ex
pected to furnish the chief Card
threat.
A half-miler, Track Captain Lyle
Reynolds; a miler, Bob Raftery, and
a two - miler, Raymond, probably
will be among the first Blue and
Gold clad entries to finish the gruel
ling event.
The cross-country will be a four
mile race starting at'lo:3o Saturday
morning.
