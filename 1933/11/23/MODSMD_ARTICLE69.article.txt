## 
### 
Robert G. Sproul, president of
U.C., praised NRA results in a talk
delivered last week at Santa Bar
bara. Pointing out Ihat wages must
be equal to prices, he defined NRA
as neither extreme fascism nor ex
treme communism but a "venture
up the middle of Ihe road toward a
controlled scientific economy."
Sproul cited the vast amount of
agricultural literature available
through universities, and called on
California to co-operate in the ag
ricultural adjustment program.
