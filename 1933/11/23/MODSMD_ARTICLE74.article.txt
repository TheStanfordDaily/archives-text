# O. H. Blackman to Solve Troubles of Transfers
## 
### 
As an integral part of the Stan
ford campus, the organization under
O. H. Blackman to give counsel to
students on any problem whether
scholastic or extra-curricular has
done wide work on the Farm.
Mr. Blackman is prepared to solve
difficulties of all students, but espe
cially junior transfers and new stu
dents of all ranks. He maintains his
office in Room 173 of the Adminis
tration Building.
This service was organized as part
of the campus program to make a
place in student life for those stu
dents who enter above the rank of
freshman without the opportunity of
becoming acquainted with Stanford
tradition.
