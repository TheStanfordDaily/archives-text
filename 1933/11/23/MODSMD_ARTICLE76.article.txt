# Brigham Young College Increases Registration
## 
### 
Enrollments at the Brigham Young
University seem to flourish through
the depression with the administra
tion anticipating an increase of stu
dents over last year.
Last year's total reached 1,710,
with 377 signing up following open
ing of school and the holidays. If
the same rate of increase continues,
registration for this year will be
close to 2,000.
