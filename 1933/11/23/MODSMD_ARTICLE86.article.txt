—"LITTLE BIG GAME"—
SAME OLD STUFF
The annual shambles in Kezar
Stadium occurred last Sunday. We
refer to the St. Marv's-Santa Clara
football game, San Francisco's "Lit
tle Big Game," which year by year
breaks the monotony of the local
hospital* by its inilux of disabled
football players.
Two years ago it was "Diamond
Joe" Pagiia who felt the wrath of
the Marauding Moiagans; this year
lightning struck twice in the same
place, and for the second time Pag
iia enjoyed the honor of an ambu
lance escort from the field.
It was not quite enough blood to
satisfy the Morons who sat in the
stands; they had to descend to the
field, interrupt an unfinished game
(according to Dowd, the Santa Claw
captain) and engage in the festivi
ties themselves. That ought to be a
good argument against those who
declare football is overemphasized,
for when a whole crowd enters
heartily into the spirit of things,
how can it be over-emphasized?
After much cracking of skulls, the
mob decided the game was a suc
cess, and desisted from their antics
after encouragment by the police.
Yes, the spectators had a good time,
and over in the hospital lay Joe
Pagiia, helpless, l'hey put him in a
cast, and there he will remain for
at least three weeks, happy because
the injury is no worse.
Clipper Smith howled about the
officials who would not call rough
tactics; Slip Madigan remained in
dignantly aloof; a stranger sus
pected of "stealing signals" was
hustled rudely from the place; Pat
Frayne deplored poor St. Mary's,
who could not afford to beat the 1
big schools, because the latter would
not play them any more, and could
not cut loose against the small
schools, because the inequalities of
the two teams would be immedia
tely disclosed.
Well, gentlemen, Stanford will
break into the same higher level of
society next year. li. seems certain
that the Stanford-St. Mary's game
will be scheduled. Therefore, re
joice. —Hamilton
