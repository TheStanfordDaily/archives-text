# Appendicitis Eliminates Moser From Varsity Golf
## 
### 
Almost tragic is the elimination of
Jim Moser from the varsity golf
squad because of appendicitis. Start
ing the year in strong number seven
position, Moser had definitely set
himself to rise in (he ladder and
was playing fine golf.
In the past Moser played a shaky
number twelve on Ihe varsity but
through summer work had improved
his golf to the seven position. H;:
had a splendid tournament record
and brilliant futrne. It is possible
that he will be able vo return to thb
varsity squad by winter quarter.
