# Card, Soccer Men Favored in Conference Playoff
## STANFORD SQUAD TO OPPOSE FAST SAN MATEO TEAM 
### 
The soccer varsity meets San
Mateo's fool-light Bulldogs in an
early afternoon Conference play
off, beginning the match play at
(his afternoon to avoid the
hazards of nocturnal hattle, to
settle the question: Resolved, That
Stanford is at the top of the soc
cer league ladder, tied there with
S.F.U. The Indian squad is tak
ing the affirmative, in a very dis
tinct and aggressive manner.
The possibility of a victory lies in
the playing of the soccermen as
they have in the past three games,
wherein, they have defeated Cali
fornia twice and S.F.U. once, run- i
Idling up 7 points to their opponents' j
! total of 3. If the conquest does ma- 1
terialize it will signify that the War- )
riors are tied for the league chain- ]
pionship and have only to repeat
their win over S.F.U. to get the
first place laurels.
Ready for. Game?
That team which has managed to
win the past three games will start, ;
led by Captain Carl Knecht, left
wing. Although the players have
not shown up well in practice and
relied entirely upon yesterday's
jolly-up for their pre-game work- I
out, the recently scoring >
I habits of the forward line should
not be inhibited once they get
warmed up.
For the offense every one of the j
five first-string players have scored j,
in the past games, Mike Gomez top
ping the list. He nas three goals to
his credit, and would possibly have '
had more if he would have played
his offensive post more and not have
1 dropped back to aid in defense to as i
; great an extent. The other forwards >
each have one score apiece on their
lists.
Lighting Important
Fullbacks Dick St rouse and Cy
Johnson, who have both been play
ing pretty classical soccer in the past
two games, will oniy need to play
las they have against California to
j assure an uncrossed goalmouth dur
ing today's game. Goalie Jack King
will fill the vulnerable scoring area, ;
unless Milt Newman plays the en- '•
tire game. It depends pretty much [
upon the lighting arrangement the,. 1
gods provide. Newman is the better
guard when visibility is hampered;'
by darkness, King being best when
the light is good.
That same set-up may affect;
whether or not Rudy Gonzales will
be in his regular right half position.
When shadows fall the difficulty of
seeing may necessitate the substitu
tion of Johnny Hitchcock for Gon
zales. No matter, both are about
the best right halfbacks to be found
in the Conference. Johnnie Moore
and Waddy White will probably be
in at center half and left half, re
spectively.
The starting line-up for this vital
contest will be, then: forwards,
Knecht, Gomez, Hearn, Kennedy,
Doddington; halfbacks, White, Gon
zales, Moore; fullbacks, Strouse,
Johnson; goali€, King.

Fullbacks Dick St rouse and Cy
Johnson, who have both been play
ing pretty classical soccer in the past
two games, will oniy need to play
las they have against California to
j assure an uncrossed goalmouth dur
ing today's game. Goalie Jack King
will fill the vulnerable scoring area, ;
unless Milt Newman plays the en- '•
tire game. It depends pretty much [
upon the lighting arrangement the,. 1
gods provide. Newman is the better
guard when visibility is hampered;'
by darkness, King being best when
the light is good.
That same set-up may affect;
whether or not Rudy Gonzales will
be in his regular right half position.
When shadows fall the difficulty of
seeing may necessitate the substitu
tion of Johnny Hitchcock for Gon
zales. No matter, both are about
the best right halfbacks to be found
in the Conference. Johnnie Moore
and Waddy White will probably be
in at center half and left half, re
spectively.
The starting line-up for this vital
contest will be, then: forwards,
Knecht, Gomez, Hearn, Kennedy,
Doddington; halfbacks, White, Gon
zales, Moore; fullbacks, Strouse,
Johnson; goali€, King.
