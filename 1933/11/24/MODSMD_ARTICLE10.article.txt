## Moot Court Gives Decision For Injury in Accident 
### 
A verdict for $10,000 damages for
personal injury was sustained late
last night by the Supreme Moot
Court of the State of Utopia in favor
of Mrs. Amanda Fairweather. Her
attorneys, Stanley Madden and A. J.
Cathcart, won the verdict only be
cause the law was in their favor.
Presiding Judge Clarke Butler
Whittier gave his decision for the
defense attornies Nathan Finch and
A. P. Quirk for their superiority in
presentation ol arguments and an
swering questions.
Summer Injury
Action in the civil suit resulted
from an acident last summer. Mrs.
Fairweather, en route 1o the Chicago
World's Fair, was traveling on a
commercial bus that crashed
through a bridge. A piece of flying
glass ruptured an eyeball of Mrs.
Fairweather and caused permanent
blindness in one eye.
The plaintiff's attorneys main
tained that the transit company was
negligent in the operation of the
bus. The defendants based their ar
guments on the fact that Mrs. Fair
weather's husband was driver of the
bus, and since the common law is
settled that a wife can't sue her hus
band for personal injury, neither can
she sue the employer of her hus
band.

This was the second of a series of
moot court trials now being held by
the Stanford Law School. Victory of
Finch and Quirk placc them in the
semi-finals to run off in the winter
quarter.
Court decisions are based solejy
on the quality of the briefs and the
facility v/ith which questions from
the bench are answered.
