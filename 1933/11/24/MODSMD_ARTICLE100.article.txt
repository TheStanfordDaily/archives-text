### 
Stanford's "Hello" tradition went
hrough an acid test at the Univer- !
ity of Washington recently when a
•(.porter's curiosity led him on a
jampus tour to find out just how
nuch of "Hello Day" was merely
tradition and how much was an ac- |
ual practice. Results: First co-ed, j
coldly, "I don't believe I've met i
you." Trio of co-eds, no response.
Four hundred students pouring ;
nit of classes, flying wedge tactics
ha' shoved the still undaunted re
porter to the bottom of a flight of
steps. Three more tries; no more (
success. A fellow journalist, not a
glance in order that, as the reporter
later learned, the girl companion
would not know that journalist 2
knew journalist 1.
Finally, two cheery "hellos"—one
from a fraternity brother and the
other from the general chairman of
'Hello Day."
