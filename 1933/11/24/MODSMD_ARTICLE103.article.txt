Joe Verducci, the "Verdooch" of the California squad, is not scheduled to start the game tomorrow, but he
will gel later on. Only 5 feet 2 inches, Joe is handicapped by lack of height but he makes it up with fight.
Harry Jones will handle left end. Dave Meek is U.C.'s latest three-letter man, but he will be out with injuries
tomorrow. (Associated Press Photo)
