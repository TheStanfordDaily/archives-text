# SAN FRANCISCO FIELD SCENE OF BIG GAME NOW HELD ON INDIAN RESERVATION
## 
### ELEANOR CARLETON 
Bunting - draped, whistling and i
tooting' down the track, a special
train carried Stanford rooters to Big
Games in the old days.
There was then no stadium on the
Farm, so a general exodus to San I
Francisco and the Haight Street field
began the morning of the game. The
Big Red Machine, plus Dr. Jordan,
the Stanford band, excited {students,
and the entire faculty, boarded the
train at the steps of Sequoia, then j
the shelter of the "500."
Train Decorated
Decorating the train was as much
a part of Big Gu;ne ritual as the
Bonfire. The cars were trundled up
to Sequoia the day before the game,
where mobs of students hung them
with Stanford emblems find miles
of bunting. Then the rain usually
fell in torrents, leaving the bunting i

faded and dripping.
A lady was a lady in those days;
and no Stanlord lady made much
noise, even on Big Game day. They
sat in the rooting section and
shrieked gently. And after the game
was over most of them went straight
home on the train.
But the tougher element of the
Cardinal rooters, the bearded males
who gave the name "rough" to
Stanford gentlemen, stayed in the
big city for the celebration. It usu
ally took place in one of the thea
ters, a special section being roped
off for Indian supporters, and cam
pus talent appearing on the stage
along with the regular bill.
"Cheerio"
Particularly popular along about
1900 as after-Big Game entertainers
were Charles Field and Shirley Ba

| ker. Field kept up his reputation;
i for he is now known as "Cheerio"
over radio station WEAF. But Ba
ker fell by the wayside, being at
the present a prominent engineer.

Into the museum should go the
request of a doting Stanford en
trant's father who wrote to Dean
Culver requesting his son to be as
signed a room with a student who
did not drink, smoke, or dance. Also
to be assigned to the museum should
be the roommate.
