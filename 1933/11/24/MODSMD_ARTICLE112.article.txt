# THIRTY THOUSAND GARS WILL FLOOD PALO ALTO ROADS
## 
### 
When between twenty-five and
thirty thousand automobiles pour
into the Stanford campus tomorrow,
to see that they go into the right
parking places, leave by the light
roads, and do both efficiently, will
be the results of long planning by
traffic authorities.
At a series of conferences between
Stanford University authorities, as
well as those of the California State
Automobile Association, highway
patrol, and chiefs of police of the
various peninsula cities, minute de
tails of traffic enforcement were
agreed upon.
Highway Closeu
Before game time gun sounds, au
tomobiles will be pouring in upon
the stadium from north and south.
However, El Camino Real, 101, main
highway to the city and southward,
will be closed from 11 a.m. to (5 p.m.
at a point opposite the stadium.
Provisions for through traffic going
southward, include detouring these
automobiles around the campus,
while through going traffic north
bound will be detourcd over to the
Bayshore highway.
Traffic authorities have advised
through going traffic to take Bay
shore high.way as much as possible
tomorrow, for it will not only be to
their advantage, but will simplify
traffic which is stadium-bound.
Easy Traffic Flow
Motorists coming southward from
San Francisco toward the campus
will have two advantages, along the
popular 101 highway route. First,
all parking of cars along that road
through all the small towns will be
eliminated, so that football traffic
may go through with less interrup
tions. Secondly, all stop and go sig
nals en route w'll be operated by
hand, instead of the customary, and
equally slow fixed time interval.
Friday night sign posters will work
after dark, putting up over 700 spe
cial signs lor guidance of Big Game
traffic. Most of these wiil be in and
around Palo Alto, where thousands
of cars will converge within a few
hours.
Three Roads Available
There will be for the first time,
three direct roads from or bv way
of San Francisco to Stanford Sta
dium. This is because for the first
time Bayshore highway, probably
shortest of the three, will be in use
all the way. As Bayshore sports
less cross-traffic than any other
highway, it will probably be a popu
lar thoroughfare tomorrow.
Skyline and El Camino Real (101)
are the other two approaches to the
campus. With ample parking space
for thirty thousand cars, c.nd capa
ble policing of the roads, all reason
ably early game-goers will have no
traffic difficulties.

eliminated, so that football traffic
may go through with less interrup
tions. Secondly, all stop and go sig
nals en route w'll be operated by
hand, instead of the customary, and
equally slow fixed time interval.
Friday night sign posters will work
after dark, putting up over 700 spe
cial signs lor guidance of Big Game
traffic. Most of these wiil be in and
around Palo Alto, where thousands
of cars will converge within a few
hours.
Three Roads Available
There will be for the first time,
three direct roads from or bv way
of San Francisco to Stanford Sta
dium. This is because for the first
time Bayshore highway, probably
shortest of the three, will be in use
all the way. As Bayshore sports
less cross-traffic than any other
highway, it will probably be a popu
lar thoroughfare tomorrow.
Skyline and El Camino Real (101)
are the other two approaches to the
campus. With ample parking space
for thirty thousand cars, c.nd capa
ble policing of the roads, all reason
ably early game-goers will have no
traffic difficulties.
When between twenty-five and
thirty thousand automobiles pour
into the Stanford campus tomorrow,
to see that they go into the right
parking places, leave by the light
roads, and do both efficiently, will
be the results of long planning by
traffic authorities.
At a series of conferences between
Stanford University authorities, as
well as those of the California State
Automobile Association, highway
patrol, and chiefs of police of the
various peninsula cities, minute de
tails of traffic enforcement were
agreed upon.
Highway Closeu
Before game time gun sounds, au
tomobiles will be pouring in upon
the stadium from north and south.
However, El Camino Real, 101, main
highway to the city and southward,
will be closed from 11 a.m. to (5 p.m.
at a point opposite the stadium.
Provisions for through traffic going
southward, include detouring these
automobiles around the campus,
while through going traffic north
bound will be detourcd over to the
Bayshore highway.
Traffic authorities have advised
through going traffic to take Bay
shore high.way as much as possible
tomorrow, for it will not only be to
their advantage, but will simplify
traffic which is stadium-bound.
Easy Traffic Flow
Motorists coming southward from
San Francisco toward the campus
will have two advantages, along the
popular 101 highway route. First,
all parking of cars along that road
through all the small towns will be
eliminated, so that football traffic
may go through with less interrup
tions. Secondly, all stop and go sig
nals en route w'll be operated by
hand, instead of the customary, and
equally slow fixed time interval.
