## Victory Against SFU Dons Features Season 
### Joe Lanidrac 
A Wednesday night decision of
the Soccer Conference Board brush
ed away Stanford's championship
aspirations almost completely, and
delegated the Cards to a second
place league standing.
Unless the San Jose soccermen
upset San Francisco Dons, the
Redmen will have to he content
to play second fiddle to S.F.U.
Stanford's season opened up as if
the Red Machine were stalled from
the beginning. They were over
whelmed by the Dons, 2-0, and
things looked black. But, that was
the beginning and the end of a poor
season.
Since then, the Cards have won
every game, and the .000 rating re
sulting from that one and only de
feat did something to a combina
tion that didn't really click again
until midseason.
In their next game, the Cards
overwhelmed San Jose 4 to 1, and
followed up this game with three
tie games; two were 1-1 ties with
San Mateo, and one a 3-3 tie with
San Jose State. Some power allowed
the Indians to outplay, outfight and
terrorize their opponent's goal line,
but never to put over the winning
score.
With their last chance, Stanford
defeated California 1-0 in their first
series game. Here it was that the
Indian soccermen began to click. A
first string strong lineup resulted
from this game. It was: forwards,
Knecht, Gomez, Hearn, Kennedy,
Doddington; halfbacks, White,
Moore, Gonzales; fullbacks, Strouse,
Johnson; and goalie. King.
A week after this game, the In
dians took into camp the highly
touted S. F. U. Dons, completely
smothering them. Hearn, Kennedy,
and Knecht were inspired. The
score ended 3-2.
This was a notable coup, but even
more gratifying v/as the joy follow
ing the Warrior's invasion over at
Berkeley. They came back with a
3-1 win, the Cards in fine shape,
playing at the peak of their game.
Gomez and Doddington were the
scorers in this important game.
