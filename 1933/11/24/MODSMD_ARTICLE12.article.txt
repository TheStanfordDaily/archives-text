# New Diet for Card Squad Food Placed Upon New Scientific Budget Grid Stars Seek Variety
## 
### FRANCES AYRES 
Wliat arc football players made
of? As the v/ar was said to be won
through the stomachs of the soldiers,
the successful 19:i:j foot bull season
may be attributed to some extent to
the new, scientific training diet used
for the first time this year.
Working on the theory that foot
-1 ball players need the same basic
diet as ordinary people, except for
quantity, the Varsity training table
1 no longer features great quantities
of starchy foods that put on weight
but not muscle.
Diet Approved
j The basic diet that meets with the
hearty approval of the team because
it provides for greater variety of
food as well as keeping them in bet
ter physical shape, is as follows:
One quart of milk; two servings
of fruit; rye. corn, or whole wheat
bread twice daily; two vegetables,
one leafy and one root; potatoes;
three pats of butter; egg; meat or
I fish once daily; and whole "rain ce

I real.
This is the perfect diet for any i
person, the difference being a mat- '
1 ter of some 2000 more calories for
a football player than for the aver
-1 age student.
Travel Diets
Another diet feature of this sea
son is the careful planning of meals
( when the team made trips to Chi
i cago and Washington. Three weeks j
beforehand, complete, menus fori
each day were given to the railroad j
cooks who complied with them to i
the extent of buying new provisions j
i if necessary.
i In accordance with conference j
rules, only one meal can be served I
the team at a regular Varsity train- |
ing teblc. Since this is dinner, held I
nightly at the Union, breakfast and i
luncheon are gotten at fraternities I
and eating clubs where enthusiastic j
chefs are more than willing to carry
out the principles of the basic diets I
Cor the benefit of football heroes. '
