# Campus Prowler Proves Menace to Oregon Coeds
## 
### 
Stanford has its campus thief and
Oregon has its "girl-grabber-in-the
dark." As a lone co-ed walked to
ward her home on the Eugene cam
pus last Friday night, a stealthy
young man leapt at her from behind
a nearby bush.
The footpad succeeded in pulling
off the buttons from the dazed girl's
leather jacket as she was prostrate
on the ground, but a passing woman
pulled a Johnny-on-the-spot, ap
pearing on the scene greatly to the
consternation of the predatory male,
who quickly disappeared offering no
clue as to his identity.
Oregon's dean of women, on hear
ing of the affair, caused a sizeable
article to be published in the Daily,
warning young campus women in
the future not to stroll alone at
night for fear of a potential "Jack
the Grabber" behind every bush.
