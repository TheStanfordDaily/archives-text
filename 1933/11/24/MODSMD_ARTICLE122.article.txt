# ALUMNI RECOLLECT FOOTBALL HEROES OF MOTHBALL AGE
## Goal Kicking of Kennedy Still Remembered 
### 
"Our ends played horse with the
men of blue,
And our hacks took the pigskin
and carried it through.
And things looked hlack for the
Berkeley crew
When Kennedy kicked the goa4."
This, to the tunc of "When John
ny Comes Marching Home," and
written by Professor M. N. Sampson,
brings to old grads memories of a
6-6 Big Game in 1893, when "Ken
nedy kicked the goal" to win for
Stanford.
Kennedy Was Faincd
Martin Kennedy, '95, died this
month in Denver, after a varied and
succcssful life, in which his Stan
ford life, in which his Stanford con
nections played no minor part.
Fullback on the Walter Camp
teams of '92 and '93 and of the team
managed by Hoover in '94, Kennedy,
by his goal kicking, made himself
the hero of the song and was re
membered by many following col
lege generations.
During Hoover's administration he
was head of the legal section of the
U.S. Department of Commerce in
London.
Invited to White House
In 1931 he was present at the re
union of the '94 team, held at the
White House by invitation of Pres
ident Hoover. All the old-time he
roes were there, including Paul
Downing, first vice-president of the
Pacific Gas and Electric Company,
and Jackson Reynolds, president of
the First National Bank of the City
of New York.
Strangely enough, in tomorrow's
Big Game looms another Kennedy.
Who knows but what we may be
singing at its close:
"And things looked hlack for the
Berkeley crew.
When Corbus kicked the goal.''
"Our ends played horse with the
