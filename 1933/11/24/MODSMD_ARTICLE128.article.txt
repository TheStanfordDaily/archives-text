# Analysis Gives Bear Line, Card Backfield Edge
## Wealth of Sophomores Makes Stanford Speed Team With Golden Bears a Hard Tackling Outfit; Both Have Baffling Offenses 
### 
Stacking the Stanford and the California football teams up side by
side, and applying a microscope with some discretion, the two squads arc
seen as pretty well matched in reserves, speed, and impressivencss. If
the Golden Bear has an edge, it is POWER, and if the Stanford Indian

has an edge, it is SPEED.
Man for man, the starting teams*
of the two schools show the line to
be fairly even, with Stanford, be
cause of its diversified backs, enjoy
ing a slight advantage in the back
field.
Let's start at the flank positions
and run lightly over the team. (Sot
to voice from rear—"You run over
'em, they look too tough for me.")
The ends at Stanford have been a
particularly bright feature of Thorn
hill's team this year. They are
coached by the veteran Jim Law
son, a great Stanford end in his day,
and a great pro football man as well,
who has been polishing and work
ing hard with his men.
Moscrip Shines
The most conspicuous is Jim
"Monk" Moscrip, former Kiski prep
ace, who in his first varsity game
stepped into the limelight as one of
the Pacific Coast's leading ends.
Terrifically speedy (he is rated the
fastest man in football on the Coast),
he has been outstanding in every
game with his spectacular, daring
play.
Watch Moscrip tomorrow going in
on the kickers and you will see
what, a beating a man can take and
come up smiling for more. At Los
Angeles two weeks ago it was Mos
crip who was responsible for keep
ing little Irv Warburton, the Trojan
quarter, well in check on his punt
returns.

♦ At right end A1 Norgard attracts
I the sports writers' attention less,
I but he completes probably the best
end combination since the days of
Lawson and Ted Shipkey. Norgard
is an artist at piling up the oppos
ing interference in tight knots, and
he teams admirably with defensive
halfback Bob Hamilton in stopping
everything that comes to the right
j of the Stanford line.
; At ends for the Golden Bear are
a number of men, none of whom are
especially distinguished, but they
are ail good hardy boys. Jim Mc-
Cormick and Harry Jones have been
1 starting most games, but the Brit
i tingham brothers, Bob and Jack,
| who began the season on the Ram
i biers, have come to the fore with
,| a bang of late. They opened last
| week's fray with Idaho, and will
probably see some action tomorrow.
Tackles are plentiful at the Ber
| keley school. Johnny Ransome, who
, i was being boomed for All-Coast and
even All-American before the sea
; | son started, has been hurt most of
j the year, but his position has been
adequately filled by Lawrence Lutz,
I a 205 - pounder from last year's
I freshmen. Harnessed with him at
i right tackle is 210-pound Bill Boone,
: a veteran and a good one.
