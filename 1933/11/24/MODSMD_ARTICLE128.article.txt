# Analysis Gives Bear Line, Card Backfield Edge
## Wealth of Sophomores Makes Stanford Speed Team With Golden Bears a Hard Tackling Outfit; Both Have Baffling Offenses 
### 
Stacking the Stanford and the California football teams up side by
side, and applying a microscope with some discretion, the two squads arc
seen as pretty well matched in reserves, speed, and impressivencss. If
the Golden Bear has an edge, it is POWER, and if the Stanford Indian

has an edge, it is SPEED.
Man for man, the starting teams*
of the two schools show the line to
be fairly even, with Stanford, be
cause of its diversified backs, enjoy
ing a slight advantage in the back
field.
Let's start at the flank positions
and run lightly over the team. (Sot
to voice from rear—"You run over
'em, they look too tough for me.")
The ends at Stanford have been a
particularly bright feature of Thorn
hill's team this year. They are
coached by the veteran Jim Law
son, a great Stanford end in his day,
and a great pro football man as well,
who has been polishing and work
ing hard with his men.
Moscrip Shines
The most conspicuous is Jim
"Monk" Moscrip, former Kiski prep
ace, who in his first varsity game
stepped into the limelight as one of
the Pacific Coast's leading ends.
Terrifically speedy (he is rated the
fastest man in football on the Coast),
he has been outstanding in every
game with his spectacular, daring
play.
Watch Moscrip tomorrow going in
on the kickers and you will see
what, a beating a man can take and
come up smiling for more. At Los
Angeles two weeks ago it was Mos
crip who was responsible for keep
ing little Irv Warburton, the Trojan
quarter, well in check on his punt
returns.

♦ At right end A1 Norgard attracts
I the sports writers' attention less,
I but he completes probably the best
end combination since the days of
Lawson and Ted Shipkey. Norgard
is an artist at piling up the oppos
ing interference in tight knots, and
he teams admirably with defensive
halfback Bob Hamilton in stopping
everything that comes to the right
j of the Stanford line.
; At ends for the Golden Bear are
a number of men, none of whom are
especially distinguished, but they
are ail good hardy boys. Jim Mc-
Cormick and Harry Jones have been
1 starting most games, but the Brit
i tingham brothers, Bob and Jack,
| who began the season on the Ram
i biers, have come to the fore with
,| a bang of late. They opened last
| week's fray with Idaho, and will
probably see some action tomorrow.
Tackles are plentiful at the Ber
| keley school. Johnny Ransome, who
, i was being boomed for All-Coast and
even All-American before the sea
; | son started, has been hurt most of
j the year, but his position has been
adequately filled by Lawrence Lutz,
I a 205 - pounder from last year's
I freshmen. Harnessed with him at
i right tackle is 210-pound Bill Boone,
: a veteran and a good one.
U.C. Tackles
Lutz and Boone were outstanding
! against the Trojans, staving off the
power threats developed by Head
man Jones. It was not their fault
that the mighty mite Warburton
bioke loose for 59 yards and won
the game late in the third quarter.
Runsome has been hurt so much it
is doubtful if he will play at all
Saturday, but with Anderson, Jes
sen, and Carlson available, the Bears
pre not lacking for reenforcements
at these key positions.
Stanford has been fortunate in
uncovering two great sophomores
who stepped out and took tackle
berths away from veterans when
the latter faltered. Claude "Cab"
Callaway, 203 pounds, plays right
tackle, and Bob Reynolds, 227
pounds, is on the port side. •
They were all that tackles could
be in the U.S.C. game won by Stan
ford, and are likely, by the time
they are seniors, to become as great
a pair as the famed Ernie Smith and
Tay Brown of the 1932 Trojans. To
morrow California must give Stan
ford at least an even standoff in
tackles.
Palamountain Hurt
Jack Drown, a fighter playing his
first year of varsity ball, and Jack
Holwerda, a vetex-an, are also on
hand for duty. Ben Palamountain,
who began the season brilliantly at
left tackle, like Ransome, has been
out with injuries most of the year.
It is not expected that he will be of
use.
Moving in towards the guards, we
find the greatest Stanford strength
concentrated. Bill Corbus has given
full evidence that he will play mag
nificent football, when he feels the
occasion is worthy of his best ef
forts. Against S.C. two weeks ago
he played probably the best ball
game of his career, kicking two field
goals to cinch the game. All-Amer
ican from last year, he had not been
boosted to retain his place, until the
Los Angeles showing.
"5 and 10" Twins
Bob O'Connor is a newcomer who
has earned a place as running mate ,
for Cobrus. In second string are a
couple of sophomores, the so-called
"5 and 10" boys, Larry Rouble and
Woody Adams, both from San Fran
cisco.
They have sparked up the offense
on every occasion they could get in
the game, and some astute observers
went so far as to suggest that they
run interference better than do
either of the veterans. Behind them
in third string are Ted Kite and
Bruce Tarver, a couple who could
be playing regular in most colleges.
Kite and Tarver
Kite was regular starter last sea
son, and was in there at the open
ing of the Big Game in 1932. The
same astute observers noted above
have been holding bull sessions
since October 1. asking each other
why Ted Kite does not get into the
ball game. Bruce Tarver is a hard
working man who deserves a break
and has never got it.
Christie vs. Muller
At center, the Bears have the
great Red Christie, who pops out
with a world beating game every
once in a while. He knocked down
everything against S.C., and made
Rosy Rosenberg pale in comparison.
But he will find an able match in
Stanford's 217-pound Wes Muller,
who has only started one game, but
that was the recent Trojan fracas.
Muller, too, made Rosenberg look
mild, and it appeal's as if a battle of
centers comparable to the memo
rable duel of Walt Heineke and Roy
Riegels were on tap. Stanford has
Bill Bates, who may possibly start
the game because of his experience
and ability defending against passes,
and Muller and Bates ought to give
the Red a near stand-off. Alf Bran
din and Lee Blanchard will be avail
able for the Indians, and Russ Cal
kins will bolster the Bear center.
Now the Backs
Moving into the Card backlield
(where we hope those Bears WON'T
be moving tomorrow), we find the
array of backs almost dazzling.
There has been justification for the
declaration this year that Thornhill
has more backs than he knows what
to do with.
The situation is so complex that
Corcli Thornhill has had veteran
Bill Sim, last year's All-Coast left
half, playing every place but full
back. And bashing Jack Hiilman,
the veteran fullback, has to take a
second place this year.
The men who have bloomed this
year include Bob Hamilton, right
half, a natural defensive man, a
great blocker, and a hard driving,
smart ball carrier. He is another of
the Kiski crew who made the 1932
freshmen, great. Behind him are
Chuck White and Kenny Affler
baugh, both letter men, hard work
ers, and artistic performers.
Afflerbaugh is apt to break up the
game with a long run to touchdown
at any moment; White is less spec
tacular, but he is reliable, and
steady.
At left half the parade opens with
Bob Maentz, a triple threat man
who plays safety and shares most
of the ball toting with the fullback.
"Buck Van Dellen, by sheer bril
liance in the last three games, has
achieved a place that may blossom
into the starting i.ssignment against
the Golden Bear. Van Dellen is ac
counted the most artful safety on
the squad, and the two passes he
caught on the memorable (57-yard
drive to the touchdown against Troy
really set Stanford up for the score.
Johnny Reisner has been handi
capped with injuries of late, but he
can kick better than most people
think; he is a whirling dervish in
the open field, one of the type that
wins ball games .it any casual mo
ment.

Shelly Bronstein is the latest find 1
at this position, and his masterly
treading of the tight rope against 1
Montana last week was indeed i
beautiful to behold.
At quarterback is perhaps the 1
most colorful of the Stanford back
lield, chunky Frank Alustiza, "Little
Boom," "Poncho," "The Bounding
Basque of Stockton," "The Owl-
Eyed Terror," or what have you?
Frankie started this season as a j
fullback, and v/as gracing the bench
k;r too many games.
Someone had 'an inspiration and i
made a quarterback of him, and he
is to the manor born. His 190 pounds
of speed bowls over the opposing
ends with eclat, viz. Captain Ford
Palmer of U.S.C.
Quick Kick Artist
His real specialty, however, is
quick kicking, and he rates with the
best on the Coast. His kicks get
away in surprisingly short time,
barely clearing the backs of the
linemen, but they straighten out and
just sail along, a few feet off the
ground. His coffin-corner kicking
against Troy was a neat bit of work.
Besides, this youth can snag a
pass or throw one with the best of
them, and he is not at all slow in
the open field.
Of Bobby Grayson, ten miles of
newsprint has probably been writ
ten, and he deserves most of it.
Fast and daring, he must be the
spark plug of the Indian attack j
tomorrow. Around the ends, under i
the middle, slashing off tackle, pass
ing, he was great against Troy, and
he must be great to stampede Cali
fornia.
Hiilman and Hoos
Jack Hiilman, his substitute, is a j
veteran who has everything that j
Grayson has except his speed. Earl j
Hoos will do the subbing for Alus- I
tiza if the latter goes out of the '
game. Hoos is a sophomore, and he l
can call a daring game. No poor
blocker, he relishes intercepting a
pass.
California has a number of excel
lent backs, all good, but no stand
outs save Arleigh Williams, triple
threat left half who has inherited
Hank Shaldach's old job. Williams
is an expert place - kickex 1 , made
three points against S.C. that way, !
and has converted successfully on J
eight attempts this season.
He does the large share of ball I
carrying, and has a good yardage
average for the year.
Bcrtoli Injured
Floyd Blower is Williams' best
sub; he is from the 1932 freshmen,
but has been injured and may not
play. Chili Bertoli is another half of
whom great things were expected,
but injuries have prevented him
from coming through. Phil Klein
and Chuck Cotton are a pair of con
verted fullbacks who may make the
team spark.
At fullback, Jim Keefer has been
doing the best work of the year.
Small for a fullback. Keefer makes
up for it in speed and drive. He is
a hard tackier, and dependable. A1
Thorell and Frank Walker are called
on if necessary; both are sopho
mores and look like comers.
Right half must be a good block
ing back on an Ingram team; George
Relies or Ken Moeller divide the
bill. Relies is from Sacramento J.C.
where he played with Bill Sim of
Stanford and Tony Beard, now o£
S.C.
Moeller was a team-mate with
Arleigh Williams on the 1931 great
freshman eleven, but he has never
had a good chance to shine.
Cal Quarterbacks
Quarterbacks include Joe Ver
ducci and Chuck Stewart. The lat
ter started the U.S.C. game and
brought the stands to their feet
when he dashed right through the
Trojans to a near touchdown on
the kick-off. Verducci is a stumpy
little fellow who plays a slam bang
game when they let him. Milo
Quisling is a San Mateo J.C. trans
fer who can do good work and may
get in the game.
This completes the list of men
who can be counted on to start or
substitute in the game. On paper
it looks as if the lines were fairly
well balanced; and the backfields,
favorable to Stanford.
However, paper advantgaes mean
nothing, and not until the last
whistle sounds will the fan know
whether superior physical ability or
superior mental set won the- game.
Stacking the Stanford and the California football teams up side by
side, and applying a microscope with some discretion, the two squads arc
seen as pretty well matched in reserves, speed, and impressivencss. If
the Golden Bear has an edge, it is POWER, and if the Stanford Indian

"5 and 10" boys, Larry Rouble and
Woody Adams, both from San Fran
cisco.
They have sparked up the offense
on every occasion they could get in
the game, and some astute observers
went so far as to suggest that they
run interference better than do
either of the veterans. Behind them
in third string are Ted Kite and
Bruce Tarver, a couple who could
be playing regular in most colleges.
Kite and Tarver
Kite was regular starter last sea
son, and was in there at the open
ing of the Big Game in 1932. The
same astute observers noted above
have been holding bull sessions
since October 1. asking each other
why Ted Kite does not get into the
ball game. Bruce Tarver is a hard
working man who deserves a break
and has never got it.
Christie vs. Muller
At center, the Bears have the
great Red Christie, who pops out
with a world beating game every
once in a while. He knocked down
everything against S.C., and made
Rosy Rosenberg pale in comparison.
But he will find an able match in
Stanford's 217-pound Wes Muller,
who has only started one game, but
that was the recent Trojan fracas.
Muller, too, made Rosenberg look
mild, and it appeal's as if a battle of
centers comparable to the memo
rable duel of Walt Heineke and Roy
Riegels were on tap. Stanford has
Bill Bates, who may possibly start
the game because of his experience
and ability defending against passes,
and Muller and Bates ought to give
the Red a near stand-off. Alf Bran
din and Lee Blanchard will be avail
able for the Indians, and Russ Cal
kins will bolster the Bear center.
Now the Backs
Moving into the Card backlield
(where we hope those Bears WON'T
be moving tomorrow), we find the
array of backs almost dazzling.
There has been justification for the
declaration this year that Thornhill
has more backs than he knows what
to do with.
The situation is so complex that
Corcli Thornhill has had veteran
Bill Sim, last year's All-Coast left
half, playing every place but full
back. And bashing Jack Hiilman,
the veteran fullback, has to take a
second place this year.
The men who have bloomed this
year include Bob Hamilton, right
half, a natural defensive man, a
great blocker, and a hard driving,
smart ball carrier. He is another of
the Kiski crew who made the 1932
freshmen, great. Behind him are
Chuck White and Kenny Affler
baugh, both letter men, hard work
ers, and artistic performers.
Afflerbaugh is apt to break up the
game with a long run to touchdown
at any moment; White is less spec
tacular, but he is reliable, and
steady.
At left half the parade opens with
Bob Maentz, a triple threat man
who plays safety and shares most
of the ball toting with the fullback.
"Buck Van Dellen, by sheer bril
liance in the last three games, has
achieved a place that may blossom
into the starting i.ssignment against
the Golden Bear. Van Dellen is ac
counted the most artful safety on
the squad, and the two passes he
caught on the memorable (57-yard
drive to the touchdown against Troy
really set Stanford up for the score.
Johnny Reisner has been handi
capped with injuries of late, but he
can kick better than most people
think; he is a whirling dervish in
the open field, one of the type that
wins ball games .it any casual mo
ment.

Shelly Bronstein is the latest find 1
at this position, and his masterly
treading of the tight rope against 1
Montana last week was indeed i
beautiful to behold.
At quarterback is perhaps the 1
most colorful of the Stanford back
lield, chunky Frank Alustiza, "Little
Boom," "Poncho," "The Bounding
Basque of Stockton," "The Owl-
Eyed Terror," or what have you?
Frankie started this season as a j
fullback, and v/as gracing the bench
k;r too many games.
Someone had 'an inspiration and i
made a quarterback of him, and he
is to the manor born. His 190 pounds
of speed bowls over the opposing
ends with eclat, viz. Captain Ford
Palmer of U.S.C.
Quick Kick Artist
His real specialty, however, is
quick kicking, and he rates with the
best on the Coast. His kicks get
away in surprisingly short time,
barely clearing the backs of the
linemen, but they straighten out and
just sail along, a few feet off the
ground. His coffin-corner kicking
against Troy was a neat bit of work.
Besides, this youth can snag a
pass or throw one with the best of
them, and he is not at all slow in
the open field.
Of Bobby Grayson, ten miles of
newsprint has probably been writ
ten, and he deserves most of it.
Fast and daring, he must be the
spark plug of the Indian attack j
tomorrow. Around the ends, under i
the middle, slashing off tackle, pass
ing, he was great against Troy, and
he must be great to stampede Cali
fornia.
Hiilman and Hoos
Jack Hiilman, his substitute, is a j
veteran who has everything that j
Grayson has except his speed. Earl j
Hoos will do the subbing for Alus- I
tiza if the latter goes out of the '
game. Hoos is a sophomore, and he l
can call a daring game. No poor
blocker, he relishes intercepting a
pass.
California has a number of excel
lent backs, all good, but no stand
outs save Arleigh Williams, triple
threat left half who has inherited
Hank Shaldach's old job. Williams
is an expert place - kickex 1 , made
three points against S.C. that way, !
and has converted successfully on J
eight attempts this season.
He does the large share of ball I
carrying, and has a good yardage
average for the year.
Bcrtoli Injured
Floyd Blower is Williams' best
sub; he is from the 1932 freshmen,
but has been injured and may not
play. Chili Bertoli is another half of
whom great things were expected,
but injuries have prevented him
from coming through. Phil Klein
and Chuck Cotton are a pair of con
verted fullbacks who may make the
team spark.
At fullback, Jim Keefer has been
doing the best work of the year.
Small for a fullback. Keefer makes
up for it in speed and drive. He is
a hard tackier, and dependable. A1
Thorell and Frank Walker are called
on if necessary; both are sopho
mores and look like comers.
Right half must be a good block
ing back on an Ingram team; George
Relies or Ken Moeller divide the
bill. Relies is from Sacramento J.C.
where he played with Bill Sim of
Stanford and Tony Beard, now o£
S.C.
Moeller was a team-mate with
Arleigh Williams on the 1931 great
freshman eleven, but he has never
had a good chance to shine.
Cal Quarterbacks
Quarterbacks include Joe Ver
ducci and Chuck Stewart. The lat
ter started the U.S.C. game and
brought the stands to their feet
when he dashed right through the
Trojans to a near touchdown on
the kick-off. Verducci is a stumpy
little fellow who plays a slam bang
game when they let him. Milo
Quisling is a San Mateo J.C. trans
fer who can do good work and may
get in the game.
This completes the list of men
who can be counted on to start or
substitute in the game. On paper
it looks as if the lines were fairly
well balanced; and the backfields,
favorable to Stanford.
However, paper advantgaes mean
nothing, and not until the last
whistle sounds will the fan know
whether superior physical ability or
superior mental set won the- game.
Stacking the Stanford and the California football teams up side by
side, and applying a microscope with some discretion, the two squads arc
seen as pretty well matched in reserves, speed, and impressivencss. If
the Golden Bear has an edge, it is POWER, and if the Stanford Indian

has an edge, it is SPEED.
Man for man, the starting teams*
of the two schools show the line to
be fairly even, with Stanford, be
cause of its diversified backs, enjoy
ing a slight advantage in the back
field.
Let's start at the flank positions
and run lightly over the team. (Sot
to voice from rear—"You run over
'em, they look too tough for me.")
The ends at Stanford have been a
particularly bright feature of Thorn
hill's team this year. They are
coached by the veteran Jim Law
son, a great Stanford end in his day,
and a great pro football man as well,
who has been polishing and work
ing hard with his men.
Moscrip Shines
The most conspicuous is Jim
"Monk" Moscrip, former Kiski prep
ace, who in his first varsity game
stepped into the limelight as one of
the Pacific Coast's leading ends.
Terrifically speedy (he is rated the
fastest man in football on the Coast),
he has been outstanding in every
game with his spectacular, daring
play.
Watch Moscrip tomorrow going in
on the kickers and you will see
what, a beating a man can take and
come up smiling for more. At Los
Angeles two weeks ago it was Mos
crip who was responsible for keep
ing little Irv Warburton, the Trojan
quarter, well in check on his punt
returns.

♦ At right end A1 Norgard attracts
I the sports writers' attention less,
I but he completes probably the best
end combination since the days of
Lawson and Ted Shipkey. Norgard
is an artist at piling up the oppos
ing interference in tight knots, and
he teams admirably with defensive
halfback Bob Hamilton in stopping
everything that comes to the right
j of the Stanford line.
; At ends for the Golden Bear are
a number of men, none of whom are
especially distinguished, but they
are ail good hardy boys. Jim Mc-
Cormick and Harry Jones have been
1 starting most games, but the Brit
i tingham brothers, Bob and Jack,
| who began the season on the Ram
i biers, have come to the fore with
,| a bang of late. They opened last
| week's fray with Idaho, and will
probably see some action tomorrow.
Tackles are plentiful at the Ber
| keley school. Johnny Ransome, who
, i was being boomed for All-Coast and
even All-American before the sea
; | son started, has been hurt most of
j the year, but his position has been
adequately filled by Lawrence Lutz,
I a 205 - pounder from last year's
I freshmen. Harnessed with him at
i right tackle is 210-pound Bill Boone,
: a veteran and a good one.
U.C. Tackles
Lutz and Boone were outstanding
! against the Trojans, staving off the
power threats developed by Head
man Jones. It was not their fault
that the mighty mite Warburton
bioke loose for 59 yards and won
the game late in the third quarter.
Runsome has been hurt so much it
is doubtful if he will play at all
Saturday, but with Anderson, Jes
sen, and Carlson available, the Bears
pre not lacking for reenforcements
at these key positions.
Stanford has been fortunate in
uncovering two great sophomores
who stepped out and took tackle
berths away from veterans when
the latter faltered. Claude "Cab"
Callaway, 203 pounds, plays right
tackle, and Bob Reynolds, 227
pounds, is on the port side. •
They were all that tackles could
be in the U.S.C. game won by Stan
ford, and are likely, by the time
they are seniors, to become as great
a pair as the famed Ernie Smith and
Tay Brown of the 1932 Trojans. To
morrow California must give Stan
ford at least an even standoff in
tackles.
Palamountain Hurt
Jack Drown, a fighter playing his
first year of varsity ball, and Jack
Holwerda, a vetex-an, are also on
hand for duty. Ben Palamountain,
who began the season brilliantly at
left tackle, like Ransome, has been
out with injuries most of the year.
It is not expected that he will be of
use.
Moving in towards the guards, we
find the greatest Stanford strength
concentrated. Bill Corbus has given
full evidence that he will play mag
nificent football, when he feels the
occasion is worthy of his best ef
forts. Against S.C. two weeks ago
he played probably the best ball
game of his career, kicking two field
goals to cinch the game. All-Amer
ican from last year, he had not been
boosted to retain his place, until the
Los Angeles showing.
"5 and 10" Twins
Bob O'Connor is a newcomer who
has earned a place as running mate ,
for Cobrus. In second string are a
couple of sophomores, the so-called
"5 and 10" boys, Larry Rouble and
Woody Adams, both from San Fran
cisco.
They have sparked up the offense
on every occasion they could get in
the game, and some astute observers

Hiilman and Hoos
Jack Hiilman, his substitute, is a j
veteran who has everything that j
Grayson has except his speed. Earl j
Hoos will do the subbing for Alus- I
tiza if the latter goes out of the '
game. Hoos is a sophomore, and he l
can call a daring game. No poor
blocker, he relishes intercepting a
pass.
California has a number of excel
lent backs, all good, but no stand
outs save Arleigh Williams, triple
threat left half who has inherited
Hank Shaldach's old job. Williams
is an expert place - kickex 1 , made
three points against S.C. that way, !
and has converted successfully on J
eight attempts this season.
He does the large share of ball I
carrying, and has a good yardage
average for the year.
Bcrtoli Injured
Floyd Blower is Williams' best
sub; he is from the 1932 freshmen,
but has been injured and may not
play. Chili Bertoli is another half of
whom great things were expected,
but injuries have prevented him
from coming through. Phil Klein
and Chuck Cotton are a pair of con
verted fullbacks who may make the
team spark.
At fullback, Jim Keefer has been
doing the best work of the year.
Small for a fullback. Keefer makes
up for it in speed and drive. He is
a hard tackier, and dependable. A1
Thorell and Frank Walker are called
on if necessary; both are sopho
mores and look like comers.
Right half must be a good block
ing back on an Ingram team; George
Relies or Ken Moeller divide the
bill. Relies is from Sacramento J.C.
where he played with Bill Sim of
Stanford and Tony Beard, now o£
S.C.
Moeller was a team-mate with
Arleigh Williams on the 1931 great
freshman eleven, but he has never
had a good chance to shine.
Cal Quarterbacks
Quarterbacks include Joe Ver
ducci and Chuck Stewart. The lat
ter started the U.S.C. game and
brought the stands to their feet
when he dashed right through the
Trojans to a near touchdown on
the kick-off. Verducci is a stumpy
little fellow who plays a slam bang
game when they let him. Milo
Quisling is a San Mateo J.C. trans
fer who can do good work and may
get in the game.
This completes the list of men
who can be counted on to start or
substitute in the game. On paper
it looks as if the lines were fairly
well balanced; and the backfields,
favorable to Stanford.
However, paper advantgaes mean
nothing, and not until the last
whistle sounds will the fan know
whether superior physical ability or
superior mental set won the- game.
Stacking the Stanford and the California football teams up side by
side, and applying a microscope with some discretion, the two squads arc
seen as pretty well matched in reserves, speed, and impressivencss. If
the Golden Bear has an edge, it is POWER, and if the Stanford Indian

has an edge, it is SPEED.
Man for man, the starting teams*
of the two schools show the line to
be fairly even, with Stanford, be
cause of its diversified backs, enjoy
ing a slight advantage in the back
field.
Let's start at the flank positions
and run lightly over the team. (Sot
to voice from rear—"You run over
'em, they look too tough for me.")
The ends at Stanford have been a
particularly bright feature of Thorn
hill's team this year. They are
coached by the veteran Jim Law
son, a great Stanford end in his day,
and a great pro football man as well,
who has been polishing and work
ing hard with his men.
Moscrip Shines
The most conspicuous is Jim
"Monk" Moscrip, former Kiski prep
ace, who in his first varsity game
stepped into the limelight as one of
the Pacific Coast's leading ends.
Terrifically speedy (he is rated the
fastest man in football on the Coast),
he has been outstanding in every
game with his spectacular, daring
play.
Watch Moscrip tomorrow going in
on the kickers and you will see
what, a beating a man can take and
come up smiling for more. At Los
Angeles two weeks ago it was Mos
crip who was responsible for keep
ing little Irv Warburton, the Trojan
quarter, well in check on his punt
returns.

♦ At right end A1 Norgard attracts
I the sports writers' attention less,
I but he completes probably the best
end combination since the days of
Lawson and Ted Shipkey. Norgard
is an artist at piling up the oppos
ing interference in tight knots, and
he teams admirably with defensive
halfback Bob Hamilton in stopping
everything that comes to the right
j of the Stanford line.
; At ends for the Golden Bear are
a number of men, none of whom are
especially distinguished, but they
are ail good hardy boys. Jim Mc-
Cormick and Harry Jones have been
1 starting most games, but the Brit
i tingham brothers, Bob and Jack,
| who began the season on the Ram
i biers, have come to the fore with
,| a bang of late. They opened last
| week's fray with Idaho, and will
probably see some action tomorrow.
Tackles are plentiful at the Ber
| keley school. Johnny Ransome, who
, i was being boomed for All-Coast and
even All-American before the sea
; | son started, has been hurt most of
j the year, but his position has been
adequately filled by Lawrence Lutz,
I a 205 - pounder from last year's
I freshmen. Harnessed with him at
i right tackle is 210-pound Bill Boone,
: a veteran and a good one.
U.C. Tackles
Lutz and Boone were outstanding
! against the Trojans, staving off the
power threats developed by Head
man Jones. It was not their fault
that the mighty mite Warburton
bioke loose for 59 yards and won
the game late in the third quarter.
Runsome has been hurt so much it
is doubtful if he will play at all
Saturday, but with Anderson, Jes
sen, and Carlson available, the Bears
pre not lacking for reenforcements
at these key positions.
Stanford has been fortunate in
uncovering two great sophomores
who stepped out and took tackle
berths away from veterans when
the latter faltered. Claude "Cab"
Callaway, 203 pounds, plays right
tackle, and Bob Reynolds, 227
pounds, is on the port side. •
They were all that tackles could
be in the U.S.C. game won by Stan
ford, and are likely, by the time
they are seniors, to become as great
a pair as the famed Ernie Smith and
Tay Brown of the 1932 Trojans. To
morrow California must give Stan
ford at least an even standoff in
tackles.
Palamountain Hurt
Jack Drown, a fighter playing his
first year of varsity ball, and Jack
Holwerda, a vetex-an, are also on
hand for duty. Ben Palamountain,
who began the season brilliantly at
left tackle, like Ransome, has been
out with injuries most of the year.
It is not expected that he will be of
use.
Moving in towards the guards, we
find the greatest Stanford strength
concentrated. Bill Corbus has given
full evidence that he will play mag
nificent football, when he feels the
occasion is worthy of his best ef
forts. Against S.C. two weeks ago
he played probably the best ball
game of his career, kicking two field
goals to cinch the game. All-Amer
ican from last year, he had not been
boosted to retain his place, until the
Los Angeles showing.
"5 and 10" Twins
Bob O'Connor is a newcomer who
has earned a place as running mate ,
for Cobrus. In second string are a
couple of sophomores, the so-called
"5 and 10" boys, Larry Rouble and
Woody Adams, both from San Fran
cisco.
They have sparked up the offense
on every occasion they could get in
the game, and some astute observers
went so far as to suggest that they
run interference better than do
either of the veterans. Behind them
in third string are Ted Kite and
Bruce Tarver, a couple who could
be playing regular in most colleges.
Kite and Tarver
Kite was regular starter last sea
son, and was in there at the open
ing of the Big Game in 1932. The
same astute observers noted above
have been holding bull sessions
since October 1. asking each other
why Ted Kite does not get into the
ball game. Bruce Tarver is a hard
working man who deserves a break
and has never got it.
Christie vs. Muller
At center, the Bears have the
great Red Christie, who pops out
with a world beating game every
once in a while. He knocked down
everything against S.C., and made
Rosy Rosenberg pale in comparison.
But he will find an able match in
Stanford's 217-pound Wes Muller,
who has only started one game, but
that was the recent Trojan fracas.
Muller, too, made Rosenberg look
mild, and it appeal's as if a battle of
centers comparable to the memo
rable duel of Walt Heineke and Roy
Riegels were on tap. Stanford has
Bill Bates, who may possibly start
the game because of his experience
and ability defending against passes,
and Muller and Bates ought to give
the Red a near stand-off. Alf Bran
din and Lee Blanchard will be avail
able for the Indians, and Russ Cal
kins will bolster the Bear center.
Now the Backs
Moving into the Card backlield
(where we hope those Bears WON'T
be moving tomorrow), we find the
array of backs almost dazzling.
There has been justification for the
declaration this year that Thornhill
has more backs than he knows what
to do with.
The situation is so complex that
Corcli Thornhill has had veteran
Bill Sim, last year's All-Coast left
half, playing every place but full
back. And bashing Jack Hiilman,
the veteran fullback, has to take a
second place this year.
The men who have bloomed this
year include Bob Hamilton, right
half, a natural defensive man, a
great blocker, and a hard driving,
smart ball carrier. He is another of
the Kiski crew who made the 1932
freshmen, great. Behind him are
Chuck White and Kenny Affler
baugh, both letter men, hard work
ers, and artistic performers.
Afflerbaugh is apt to break up the
game with a long run to touchdown
at any moment; White is less spec
tacular, but he is reliable, and
steady.
At left half the parade opens with
Bob Maentz, a triple threat man
who plays safety and shares most
of the ball toting with the fullback.
"Buck Van Dellen, by sheer bril
liance in the last three games, has
achieved a place that may blossom
into the starting i.ssignment against
the Golden Bear. Van Dellen is ac
counted the most artful safety on
the squad, and the two passes he
caught on the memorable (57-yard
drive to the touchdown against Troy
really set Stanford up for the score.
Johnny Reisner has been handi
capped with injuries of late, but he
can kick better than most people
think; he is a whirling dervish in
the open field, one of the type that
wins ball games .it any casual mo
ment.

Shelly Bronstein is the latest find 1
at this position, and his masterly
treading of the tight rope against 1
Montana last week was indeed i
beautiful to behold.
At quarterback is perhaps the 1
most colorful of the Stanford back
lield, chunky Frank Alustiza, "Little
Boom," "Poncho," "The Bounding
Basque of Stockton," "The Owl-
Eyed Terror," or what have you?
Frankie started this season as a j
fullback, and v/as gracing the bench
k;r too many games.
Someone had 'an inspiration and i
made a quarterback of him, and he
is to the manor born. His 190 pounds
of speed bowls over the opposing
ends with eclat, viz. Captain Ford
Palmer of U.S.C.
Quick Kick Artist
His real specialty, however, is
quick kicking, and he rates with the
best on the Coast. His kicks get
away in surprisingly short time,
barely clearing the backs of the
linemen, but they straighten out and
just sail along, a few feet off the
ground. His coffin-corner kicking
against Troy was a neat bit of work.
Besides, this youth can snag a
pass or throw one with the best of
them, and he is not at all slow in
the open field.
Of Bobby Grayson, ten miles of
newsprint has probably been writ
ten, and he deserves most of it.
Fast and daring, he must be the
spark plug of the Indian attack j
tomorrow. Around the ends, under i
the middle, slashing off tackle, pass
ing, he was great against Troy, and
he must be great to stampede Cali
fornia.
Hiilman and Hoos
Jack Hiilman, his substitute, is a j
veteran who has everything that j
Grayson has except his speed. Earl j
Hoos will do the subbing for Alus- I
tiza if the latter goes out of the '
game. Hoos is a sophomore, and he l
can call a daring game. No poor

| week's fray with Idaho, and will
probably see some action tomorrow.
Tackles are plentiful at the Ber
| keley school. Johnny Ransome, who
, i was being boomed for All-Coast and
even All-American before the sea
; | son started, has been hurt most of
j the year, but his position has been
adequately filled by Lawrence Lutz,
I a 205 - pounder from last year's
I freshmen. Harnessed with him at
i right tackle is 210-pound Bill Boone,
: a veteran and a good one.
U.C. Tackles
Lutz and Boone were outstanding
! against the Trojans, staving off the
power threats developed by Head
man Jones. It was not their fault
that the mighty mite Warburton
bioke loose for 59 yards and won
the game late in the third quarter.
Runsome has been hurt so much it
is doubtful if he will play at all
Saturday, but with Anderson, Jes
sen, and Carlson available, the Bears
pre not lacking for reenforcements
at these key positions.
Stanford has been fortunate in
uncovering two great sophomores
who stepped out and took tackle
berths away from veterans when
the latter faltered. Claude "Cab"
Callaway, 203 pounds, plays right
tackle, and Bob Reynolds, 227
pounds, is on the port side. •
They were all that tackles could
be in the U.S.C. game won by Stan
ford, and are likely, by the time
they are seniors, to become as great
a pair as the famed Ernie Smith and
Tay Brown of the 1932 Trojans. To
morrow California must give Stan
ford at least an even standoff in
tackles.
Palamountain Hurt
Jack Drown, a fighter playing his
first year of varsity ball, and Jack
Holwerda, a vetex-an, are also on
hand for duty. Ben Palamountain,
who began the season brilliantly at
left tackle, like Ransome, has been
out with injuries most of the year.
It is not expected that he will be of
use.
Moving in towards the guards, we
find the greatest Stanford strength
concentrated. Bill Corbus has given
full evidence that he will play mag
nificent football, when he feels the
occasion is worthy of his best ef
forts. Against S.C. two weeks ago
he played probably the best ball
game of his career, kicking two field
goals to cinch the game. All-Amer
ican from last year, he had not been
boosted to retain his place, until the
Los Angeles showing.
"5 and 10" Twins
Bob O'Connor is a newcomer who
has earned a place as running mate ,
for Cobrus. In second string are a
couple of sophomores, the so-called
"5 and 10" boys, Larry Rouble and
Woody Adams, both from San Fran
cisco.
They have sparked up the offense
on every occasion they could get in
the game, and some astute observers
went so far as to suggest that they
run interference better than do
either of the veterans. Behind them
in third string are Ted Kite and
Bruce Tarver, a couple who could
be playing regular in most colleges.
Kite and Tarver
Kite was regular starter last sea
son, and was in there at the open
ing of the Big Game in 1932. The
same astute observers noted above
have been holding bull sessions
since October 1. asking each other
why Ted Kite does not get into the
ball game. Bruce Tarver is a hard
working man who deserves a break
and has never got it.
Christie vs. Muller
At center, the Bears have the
great Red Christie, who pops out
with a world beating game every
once in a while. He knocked down
everything against S.C., and made
Rosy Rosenberg pale in comparison.
But he will find an able match in
Stanford's 217-pound Wes Muller,
who has only started one game, but
that was the recent Trojan fracas.
Muller, too, made Rosenberg look
mild, and it appeal's as if a battle of
centers comparable to the memo
rable duel of Walt Heineke and Roy
Riegels were on tap. Stanford has
Bill Bates, who may possibly start
the game because of his experience
and ability defending against passes,
and Muller and Bates ought to give
the Red a near stand-off. Alf Bran
din and Lee Blanchard will be avail
able for the Indians, and Russ Cal
kins will bolster the Bear center.
Now the Backs
Moving into the Card backlield
(where we hope those Bears WON'T
be moving tomorrow), we find the
array of backs almost dazzling.
There has been justification for the
declaration this year that Thornhill
has more backs than he knows what
to do with.
The situation is so complex that
Corcli Thornhill has had veteran
Bill Sim, last year's All-Coast left
half, playing every place but full
back. And bashing Jack Hiilman,
the veteran fullback, has to take a
second place this year.
The men who have bloomed this
year include Bob Hamilton, right
half, a natural defensive man, a
great blocker, and a hard driving,
smart ball carrier. He is another of
the Kiski crew who made the 1932
freshmen, great. Behind him are
Chuck White and Kenny Affler
baugh, both letter men, hard work
ers, and artistic performers.
Afflerbaugh is apt to break up the
game with a long run to touchdown
at any moment; White is less spec
tacular, but he is reliable, and
steady.
At left half the parade opens with
Bob Maentz, a triple threat man
who plays safety and shares most
of the ball toting with the fullback.
"Buck Van Dellen, by sheer bril
liance in the last three games, has
achieved a place that may blossom
into the starting i.ssignment against
the Golden Bear. Van Dellen is ac
counted the most artful safety on
the squad, and the two passes he
caught on the memorable (57-yard
drive to the touchdown against Troy
really set Stanford up for the score.
Johnny Reisner has been handi
capped with injuries of late, but he
can kick better than most people
think; he is a whirling dervish in
the open field, one of the type that
wins ball games .it any casual mo
ment.

Shelly Bronstein is the latest find 1
at this position, and his masterly
treading of the tight rope against 1
Montana last week was indeed i
beautiful to behold.
At quarterback is perhaps the 1
most colorful of the Stanford back
lield, chunky Frank Alustiza, "Little
Boom," "Poncho," "The Bounding
Basque of Stockton," "The Owl-
Eyed Terror," or what have you?
Frankie started this season as a j
fullback, and v/as gracing the bench
k;r too many games.
Someone had 'an inspiration and i
made a quarterback of him, and he
is to the manor born. His 190 pounds
of speed bowls over the opposing
ends with eclat, viz. Captain Ford
Palmer of U.S.C.
Quick Kick Artist
His real specialty, however, is
quick kicking, and he rates with the
best on the Coast. His kicks get
away in surprisingly short time,
barely clearing the backs of the
linemen, but they straighten out and
just sail along, a few feet off the
ground. His coffin-corner kicking
against Troy was a neat bit of work.
Besides, this youth can snag a
pass or throw one with the best of
them, and he is not at all slow in
the open field.
Of Bobby Grayson, ten miles of
newsprint has probably been writ
ten, and he deserves most of it.
Fast and daring, he must be the
spark plug of the Indian attack j
tomorrow. Around the ends, under i
the middle, slashing off tackle, pass
ing, he was great against Troy, and
he must be great to stampede Cali
fornia.
Hiilman and Hoos
Jack Hiilman, his substitute, is a j
veteran who has everything that j
Grayson has except his speed. Earl j
Hoos will do the subbing for Alus- I
tiza if the latter goes out of the '
game. Hoos is a sophomore, and he l
can call a daring game. No poor
blocker, he relishes intercepting a
pass.
California has a number of excel
lent backs, all good, but no stand
outs save Arleigh Williams, triple
threat left half who has inherited
Hank Shaldach's old job. Williams
is an expert place - kickex 1 , made
three points against S.C. that way, !
and has converted successfully on J
eight attempts this season.
He does the large share of ball I
carrying, and has a good yardage
average for the year.
Bcrtoli Injured
Floyd Blower is Williams' best
sub; he is from the 1932 freshmen,
but has been injured and may not
play. Chili Bertoli is another half of
whom great things were expected,
but injuries have prevented him
from coming through. Phil Klein
and Chuck Cotton are a pair of con
verted fullbacks who may make the
team spark.
At fullback, Jim Keefer has been
doing the best work of the year.
Small for a fullback. Keefer makes
up for it in speed and drive. He is
a hard tackier, and dependable. A1
Thorell and Frank Walker are called
on if necessary; both are sopho
mores and look like comers.
Right half must be a good block
ing back on an Ingram team; George
Relies or Ken Moeller divide the
bill. Relies is from Sacramento J.C.
where he played with Bill Sim of
Stanford and Tony Beard, now o£
S.C.
Moeller was a team-mate with
Arleigh Williams on the 1931 great
freshman eleven, but he has never
had a good chance to shine.
Cal Quarterbacks
Quarterbacks include Joe Ver
ducci and Chuck Stewart. The lat
ter started the U.S.C. game and
brought the stands to their feet
when he dashed right through the
Trojans to a near touchdown on
the kick-off. Verducci is a stumpy
little fellow who plays a slam bang
game when they let him. Milo
Quisling is a San Mateo J.C. trans
fer who can do good work and may
get in the game.
This completes the list of men
who can be counted on to start or
substitute in the game. On paper
it looks as if the lines were fairly
well balanced; and the backfields,
favorable to Stanford.
However, paper advantgaes mean
nothing, and not until the last
whistle sounds will the fan know
whether superior physical ability or
superior mental set won the- game.
Stacking the Stanford and the California football teams up side by
side, and applying a microscope with some discretion, the two squads arc
seen as pretty well matched in reserves, speed, and impressivencss. If
the Golden Bear has an edge, it is POWER, and if the Stanford Indian

has an edge, it is SPEED.
Man for man, the starting teams*
of the two schools show the line to
be fairly even, with Stanford, be
cause of its diversified backs, enjoy
ing a slight advantage in the back
field.
Let's start at the flank positions
and run lightly over the team. (Sot
to voice from rear—"You run over
'em, they look too tough for me.")
The ends at Stanford have been a
particularly bright feature of Thorn
hill's team this year. They are
coached by the veteran Jim Law
son, a great Stanford end in his day,
and a great pro football man as well,
who has been polishing and work
ing hard with his men.
Moscrip Shines
The most conspicuous is Jim
"Monk" Moscrip, former Kiski prep
ace, who in his first varsity game
stepped into the limelight as one of
the Pacific Coast's leading ends.
Terrifically speedy (he is rated the
fastest man in football on the Coast),
he has been outstanding in every
game with his spectacular, daring
play.
Watch Moscrip tomorrow going in
on the kickers and you will see
what, a beating a man can take and
come up smiling for more. At Los
Angeles two weeks ago it was Mos
crip who was responsible for keep
ing little Irv Warburton, the Trojan
quarter, well in check on his punt
returns.

♦ At right end A1 Norgard attracts
I the sports writers' attention less,
I but he completes probably the best
end combination since the days of
Lawson and Ted Shipkey. Norgard
is an artist at piling up the oppos
ing interference in tight knots, and
he teams admirably with defensive
halfback Bob Hamilton in stopping
everything that comes to the right
j of the Stanford line.
; At ends for the Golden Bear are
a number of men, none of whom are
especially distinguished, but they
are ail good hardy boys. Jim Mc-
Cormick and Harry Jones have been
1 starting most games, but the Brit
i tingham brothers, Bob and Jack,
| who began the season on the Ram
i biers, have come to the fore with
,| a bang of late. They opened last

freshmen, great. Behind him are
Chuck White and Kenny Affler
baugh, both letter men, hard work
ers, and artistic performers.
Afflerbaugh is apt to break up the
game with a long run to touchdown
at any moment; White is less spec
tacular, but he is reliable, and
steady.
At left half the parade opens with
Bob Maentz, a triple threat man
who plays safety and shares most
of the ball toting with the fullback.
"Buck Van Dellen, by sheer bril
liance in the last three games, has
achieved a place that may blossom
into the starting i.ssignment against
the Golden Bear. Van Dellen is ac
counted the most artful safety on
the squad, and the two passes he
caught on the memorable (57-yard
drive to the touchdown against Troy
really set Stanford up for the score.
Johnny Reisner has been handi
capped with injuries of late, but he
can kick better than most people
think; he is a whirling dervish in
the open field, one of the type that
wins ball games .it any casual mo
ment.

Shelly Bronstein is the latest find 1
at this position, and his masterly
treading of the tight rope against 1
Montana last week was indeed i
beautiful to behold.
At quarterback is perhaps the 1
most colorful of the Stanford back
lield, chunky Frank Alustiza, "Little
Boom," "Poncho," "The Bounding
Basque of Stockton," "The Owl-
Eyed Terror," or what have you?
Frankie started this season as a j
fullback, and v/as gracing the bench
k;r too many games.
Someone had 'an inspiration and i
made a quarterback of him, and he
is to the manor born. His 190 pounds
of speed bowls over the opposing
ends with eclat, viz. Captain Ford
Palmer of U.S.C.
Quick Kick Artist
His real specialty, however, is
quick kicking, and he rates with the
best on the Coast. His kicks get
away in surprisingly short time,
barely clearing the backs of the
linemen, but they straighten out and
just sail along, a few feet off the
ground. His coffin-corner kicking
against Troy was a neat bit of work.
Besides, this youth can snag a
pass or throw one with the best of
them, and he is not at all slow in
the open field.
Of Bobby Grayson, ten miles of
newsprint has probably been writ
ten, and he deserves most of it.
Fast and daring, he must be the
spark plug of the Indian attack j
tomorrow. Around the ends, under i
the middle, slashing off tackle, pass
ing, he was great against Troy, and
he must be great to stampede Cali
fornia.
Hiilman and Hoos
Jack Hiilman, his substitute, is a j
veteran who has everything that j
Grayson has except his speed. Earl j
Hoos will do the subbing for Alus- I
tiza if the latter goes out of the '
game. Hoos is a sophomore, and he l
can call a daring game. No poor
blocker, he relishes intercepting a
pass.
California has a number of excel
lent backs, all good, but no stand
outs save Arleigh Williams, triple
threat left half who has inherited
Hank Shaldach's old job. Williams
is an expert place - kickex 1 , made
three points against S.C. that way, !
and has converted successfully on J
eight attempts this season.
He does the large share of ball I
carrying, and has a good yardage
average for the year.
Bcrtoli Injured
Floyd Blower is Williams' best
sub; he is from the 1932 freshmen,
but has been injured and may not
play. Chili Bertoli is another half of
whom great things were expected,
but injuries have prevented him
from coming through. Phil Klein
and Chuck Cotton are a pair of con
verted fullbacks who may make the
team spark.
At fullback, Jim Keefer has been
doing the best work of the year.
Small for a fullback. Keefer makes
up for it in speed and drive. He is
a hard tackier, and dependable. A1
Thorell and Frank Walker are called
on if necessary; both are sopho
mores and look like comers.
Right half must be a good block
ing back on an Ingram team; George
Relies or Ken Moeller divide the
bill. Relies is from Sacramento J.C.
where he played with Bill Sim of
Stanford and Tony Beard, now o£
S.C.
Moeller was a team-mate with
Arleigh Williams on the 1931 great
freshman eleven, but he has never
had a good chance to shine.
Cal Quarterbacks
Quarterbacks include Joe Ver
ducci and Chuck Stewart. The lat
ter started the U.S.C. game and
brought the stands to their feet
when he dashed right through the
Trojans to a near touchdown on
the kick-off. Verducci is a stumpy
little fellow who plays a slam bang
game when they let him. Milo
Quisling is a San Mateo J.C. trans
fer who can do good work and may
get in the game.
This completes the list of men
who can be counted on to start or
substitute in the game. On paper
it looks as if the lines were fairly
well balanced; and the backfields,
favorable to Stanford.
However, paper advantgaes mean
nothing, and not until the last
whistle sounds will the fan know
whether superior physical ability or
superior mental set won the- game.
Stacking the Stanford and the California football teams up side by
side, and applying a microscope with some discretion, the two squads arc
seen as pretty well matched in reserves, speed, and impressivencss. If
the Golden Bear has an edge, it is POWER, and if the Stanford Indian

has an edge, it is SPEED.
Man for man, the starting teams*
of the two schools show the line to
be fairly even, with Stanford, be
cause of its diversified backs, enjoy
ing a slight advantage in the back
field.
Let's start at the flank positions
and run lightly over the team. (Sot
to voice from rear—"You run over
'em, they look too tough for me.")
The ends at Stanford have been a
particularly bright feature of Thorn
hill's team this year. They are
coached by the veteran Jim Law
son, a great Stanford end in his day,
and a great pro football man as well,
who has been polishing and work
ing hard with his men.
Moscrip Shines
The most conspicuous is Jim
"Monk" Moscrip, former Kiski prep
ace, who in his first varsity game
stepped into the limelight as one of
the Pacific Coast's leading ends.
Terrifically speedy (he is rated the
fastest man in football on the Coast),
he has been outstanding in every
game with his spectacular, daring
play.
Watch Moscrip tomorrow going in
on the kickers and you will see
what, a beating a man can take and
come up smiling for more. At Los
Angeles two weeks ago it was Mos
crip who was responsible for keep
ing little Irv Warburton, the Trojan
quarter, well in check on his punt
returns.

♦ At right end A1 Norgard attracts
I the sports writers' attention less,
I but he completes probably the best
end combination since the days of
Lawson and Ted Shipkey. Norgard
is an artist at piling up the oppos
ing interference in tight knots, and
he teams admirably with defensive
halfback Bob Hamilton in stopping
everything that comes to the right
j of the Stanford line.
; At ends for the Golden Bear are
a number of men, none of whom are
especially distinguished, but they
are ail good hardy boys. Jim Mc-
Cormick and Harry Jones have been
1 starting most games, but the Brit
i tingham brothers, Bob and Jack,
| who began the season on the Ram
i biers, have come to the fore with
,| a bang of late. They opened last
| week's fray with Idaho, and will
probably see some action tomorrow.
Tackles are plentiful at the Ber
| keley school. Johnny Ransome, who
, i was being boomed for All-Coast and
even All-American before the sea
; | son started, has been hurt most of
j the year, but his position has been
adequately filled by Lawrence Lutz,
I a 205 - pounder from last year's
I freshmen. Harnessed with him at
i right tackle is 210-pound Bill Boone,
: a veteran and a good one.
U.C. Tackles
Lutz and Boone were outstanding
! against the Trojans, staving off the
power threats developed by Head
man Jones. It was not their fault
that the mighty mite Warburton
bioke loose for 59 yards and won
the game late in the third quarter.
Runsome has been hurt so much it
is doubtful if he will play at all
Saturday, but with Anderson, Jes
sen, and Carlson available, the Bears
pre not lacking for reenforcements
at these key positions.
Stanford has been fortunate in
uncovering two great sophomores
who stepped out and took tackle
berths away from veterans when
the latter faltered. Claude "Cab"
Callaway, 203 pounds, plays right
tackle, and Bob Reynolds, 227
pounds, is on the port side. •
They were all that tackles could
be in the U.S.C. game won by Stan
ford, and are likely, by the time
they are seniors, to become as great
a pair as the famed Ernie Smith and
Tay Brown of the 1932 Trojans. To
morrow California must give Stan
ford at least an even standoff in
tackles.
Palamountain Hurt
Jack Drown, a fighter playing his
first year of varsity ball, and Jack
Holwerda, a vetex-an, are also on
hand for duty. Ben Palamountain,
who began the season brilliantly at
left tackle, like Ransome, has been
out with injuries most of the year.
It is not expected that he will be of
use.
Moving in towards the guards, we
find the greatest Stanford strength
concentrated. Bill Corbus has given
full evidence that he will play mag
nificent football, when he feels the
occasion is worthy of his best ef
forts. Against S.C. two weeks ago
he played probably the best ball
game of his career, kicking two field
goals to cinch the game. All-Amer
ican from last year, he had not been
boosted to retain his place, until the
Los Angeles showing.
"5 and 10" Twins
Bob O'Connor is a newcomer who
has earned a place as running mate ,
for Cobrus. In second string are a
couple of sophomores, the so-called
"5 and 10" boys, Larry Rouble and
Woody Adams, both from San Fran
cisco.
They have sparked up the offense
on every occasion they could get in
the game, and some astute observers
went so far as to suggest that they
run interference better than do
either of the veterans. Behind them
in third string are Ted Kite and
Bruce Tarver, a couple who could
be playing regular in most colleges.
Kite and Tarver
Kite was regular starter last sea
son, and was in there at the open
ing of the Big Game in 1932. The
same astute observers noted above
have been holding bull sessions
since October 1. asking each other
why Ted Kite does not get into the
ball game. Bruce Tarver is a hard
working man who deserves a break
and has never got it.
Christie vs. Muller
At center, the Bears have the
great Red Christie, who pops out
with a world beating game every
once in a while. He knocked down
everything against S.C., and made
Rosy Rosenberg pale in comparison.
But he will find an able match in
Stanford's 217-pound Wes Muller,
who has only started one game, but
that was the recent Trojan fracas.
Muller, too, made Rosenberg look
mild, and it appeal's as if a battle of
centers comparable to the memo
rable duel of Walt Heineke and Roy
Riegels were on tap. Stanford has
Bill Bates, who may possibly start
the game because of his experience
and ability defending against passes,
and Muller and Bates ought to give
the Red a near stand-off. Alf Bran
din and Lee Blanchard will be avail
able for the Indians, and Russ Cal
kins will bolster the Bear center.
Now the Backs
Moving into the Card backlield
(where we hope those Bears WON'T
be moving tomorrow), we find the
array of backs almost dazzling.
There has been justification for the
declaration this year that Thornhill
has more backs than he knows what
to do with.
The situation is so complex that
Corcli Thornhill has had veteran
Bill Sim, last year's All-Coast left
half, playing every place but full
back. And bashing Jack Hiilman,
the veteran fullback, has to take a
second place this year.
The men who have bloomed this
year include Bob Hamilton, right
half, a natural defensive man, a
great blocker, and a hard driving,
smart ball carrier. He is another of
the Kiski crew who made the 1932
freshmen, great. Behind him are
Chuck White and Kenny Affler
baugh, both letter men, hard work
ers, and artistic performers.
Afflerbaugh is apt to break up the
game with a long run to touchdown
at any moment; White is less spec
tacular, but he is reliable, and

ground. His coffin-corner kicking
against Troy was a neat bit of work.
Besides, this youth can snag a
pass or throw one with the best of
them, and he is not at all slow in
the open field.
Of Bobby Grayson, ten miles of
newsprint has probably been writ
ten, and he deserves most of it.
Fast and daring, he must be the
spark plug of the Indian attack j
tomorrow. Around the ends, under i
the middle, slashing off tackle, pass
ing, he was great against Troy, and
he must be great to stampede Cali
fornia.
Hiilman and Hoos
Jack Hiilman, his substitute, is a j
veteran who has everything that j
Grayson has except his speed. Earl j
Hoos will do the subbing for Alus- I
tiza if the latter goes out of the '
game. Hoos is a sophomore, and he l
can call a daring game. No poor
blocker, he relishes intercepting a
pass.
California has a number of excel
lent backs, all good, but no stand
outs save Arleigh Williams, triple
threat left half who has inherited
Hank Shaldach's old job. Williams
is an expert place - kickex 1 , made
three points against S.C. that way, !
and has converted successfully on J
eight attempts this season.
He does the large share of ball I
carrying, and has a good yardage
average for the year.
Bcrtoli Injured
Floyd Blower is Williams' best
sub; he is from the 1932 freshmen,
but has been injured and may not
play. Chili Bertoli is another half of
whom great things were expected,
but injuries have prevented him
from coming through. Phil Klein
and Chuck Cotton are a pair of con
verted fullbacks who may make the
team spark.
At fullback, Jim Keefer has been
doing the best work of the year.
Small for a fullback. Keefer makes
up for it in speed and drive. He is
a hard tackier, and dependable. A1
Thorell and Frank Walker are called
on if necessary; both are sopho
mores and look like comers.
Right half must be a good block
ing back on an Ingram team; George
Relies or Ken Moeller divide the
bill. Relies is from Sacramento J.C.
where he played with Bill Sim of
Stanford and Tony Beard, now o£
S.C.
Moeller was a team-mate with
Arleigh Williams on the 1931 great
freshman eleven, but he has never
had a good chance to shine.
Cal Quarterbacks
Quarterbacks include Joe Ver
ducci and Chuck Stewart. The lat
ter started the U.S.C. game and
brought the stands to their feet
when he dashed right through the
Trojans to a near touchdown on
the kick-off. Verducci is a stumpy
little fellow who plays a slam bang
game when they let him. Milo
Quisling is a San Mateo J.C. trans
fer who can do good work and may
get in the game.
This completes the list of men
who can be counted on to start or
substitute in the game. On paper
it looks as if the lines were fairly
well balanced; and the backfields,
favorable to Stanford.
However, paper advantgaes mean
nothing, and not until the last
whistle sounds will the fan know
whether superior physical ability or
superior mental set won the- game.
power threats developed by Head
man Jones. It was not their fault
that the mighty mite Warburton
bioke loose for 59 yards and won
the game late in the third quarter.
Runsome has been hurt so much it
is doubtful if he will play at all
Saturday, but with Anderson, Jes
sen, and Carlson available, the Bears
pre not lacking for reenforcements
at these key positions.
Stanford has been fortunate in
uncovering two great sophomores
who stepped out and took tackle
berths away from veterans when
the latter faltered. Claude "Cab"
Callaway, 203 pounds, plays right
tackle, and Bob Reynolds, 227
pounds, is on the port side. •
They were all that tackles could
be in the U.S.C. game won by Stan
ford, and are likely, by the time
they are seniors, to become as great
a pair as the famed Ernie Smith and
Tay Brown of the 1932 Trojans. To
morrow California must give Stan
ford at least an even standoff in
tackles.
Palamountain Hurt
Jack Drown, a fighter playing his
first year of varsity ball, and Jack
Holwerda, a vetex-an, are also on
hand for duty. Ben Palamountain,
who began the season brilliantly at
left tackle, like Ransome, has been
out with injuries most of the year.
It is not expected that he will be of
use.
Moving in towards the guards, we
find the greatest Stanford strength
concentrated. Bill Corbus has given
full evidence that he will play mag
nificent football, when he feels the
occasion is worthy of his best ef
forts. Against S.C. two weeks ago
he played probably the best ball
game of his career, kicking two field
goals to cinch the game. All-Amer
ican from last year, he had not been
boosted to retain his place, until the
Los Angeles showing.
"5 and 10" Twins
Bob O'Connor is a newcomer who
has earned a place as running mate ,
for Cobrus. In second string are a
couple of sophomores, the so-called
"5 and 10" boys, Larry Rouble and
Woody Adams, both from San Fran
cisco.
They have sparked up the offense
on every occasion they could get in
the game, and some astute observers
went so far as to suggest that they
run interference better than do
either of the veterans. Behind them
in third string are Ted Kite and
Bruce Tarver, a couple who could
be playing regular in most colleges.
Kite and Tarver
Kite was regular starter last sea
son, and was in there at the open
ing of the Big Game in 1932. The
same astute observers noted above
have been holding bull sessions
since October 1. asking each other
why Ted Kite does not get into the
ball game. Bruce Tarver is a hard
working man who deserves a break
and has never got it.
Christie vs. Muller
At center, the Bears have the
great Red Christie, who pops out
with a world beating game every
once in a while. He knocked down
everything against S.C., and made
Rosy Rosenberg pale in comparison.
But he will find an able match in
Stanford's 217-pound Wes Muller,
who has only started one game, but
that was the recent Trojan fracas.
Muller, too, made Rosenberg look
mild, and it appeal's as if a battle of
centers comparable to the memo
rable duel of Walt Heineke and Roy
Riegels were on tap. Stanford has
Bill Bates, who may possibly start
the game because of his experience
and ability defending against passes,
and Muller and Bates ought to give
the Red a near stand-off. Alf Bran
din and Lee Blanchard will be avail
able for the Indians, and Russ Cal
kins will bolster the Bear center.
Now the Backs
Moving into the Card backlield
(where we hope those Bears WON'T
be moving tomorrow), we find the
array of backs almost dazzling.
There has been justification for the
declaration this year that Thornhill
has more backs than he knows what
to do with.
The situation is so complex that
Corcli Thornhill has had veteran
Bill Sim, last year's All-Coast left
half, playing every place but full
back. And bashing Jack Hiilman,
the veteran fullback, has to take a
second place this year.
The men who have bloomed this
year include Bob Hamilton, right
half, a natural defensive man, a
great blocker, and a hard driving,
smart ball carrier. He is another of
the Kiski crew who made the 1932
freshmen, great. Behind him are
Chuck White and Kenny Affler
baugh, both letter men, hard work
ers, and artistic performers.
Afflerbaugh is apt to break up the
game with a long run to touchdown
at any moment; White is less spec
tacular, but he is reliable, and
steady.
At left half the parade opens with
Bob Maentz, a triple threat man
who plays safety and shares most
of the ball toting with the fullback.
"Buck Van Dellen, by sheer bril
liance in the last three games, has
achieved a place that may blossom
into the starting i.ssignment against
the Golden Bear. Van Dellen is ac
counted the most artful safety on
the squad, and the two passes he
caught on the memorable (57-yard
drive to the touchdown against Troy
really set Stanford up for the score.
Johnny Reisner has been handi
capped with injuries of late, but he
can kick better than most people
think; he is a whirling dervish in
the open field, one of the type that
wins ball games .it any casual mo
ment.

Shelly Bronstein is the latest find 1
at this position, and his masterly
treading of the tight rope against 1
Montana last week was indeed i
beautiful to behold.
At quarterback is perhaps the 1
most colorful of the Stanford back
lield, chunky Frank Alustiza, "Little
Boom," "Poncho," "The Bounding
Basque of Stockton," "The Owl-
Eyed Terror," or what have you?
Frankie started this season as a j
fullback, and v/as gracing the bench
k;r too many games.
Someone had 'an inspiration and i
made a quarterback of him, and he
is to the manor born. His 190 pounds
of speed bowls over the opposing
ends with eclat, viz. Captain Ford
Palmer of U.S.C.
Quick Kick Artist
His real specialty, however, is
quick kicking, and he rates with the
best on the Coast. His kicks get
away in surprisingly short time,
barely clearing the backs of the
linemen, but they straighten out and
just sail along, a few feet off the
ground. His coffin-corner kicking
against Troy was a neat bit of work.
Besides, this youth can snag a
pass or throw one with the best of
them, and he is not at all slow in

Stacking the Stanford and the California football teams up side by
side, and applying a microscope with some discretion, the two squads arc
seen as pretty well matched in reserves, speed, and impressivencss. If
the Golden Bear has an edge, it is POWER, and if the Stanford Indian

has an edge, it is SPEED.
Man for man, the starting teams*
of the two schools show the line to
be fairly even, with Stanford, be
cause of its diversified backs, enjoy
ing a slight advantage in the back
field.
Let's start at the flank positions
and run lightly over the team. (Sot
to voice from rear—"You run over
'em, they look too tough for me.")
The ends at Stanford have been a
particularly bright feature of Thorn
hill's team this year. They are
coached by the veteran Jim Law
son, a great Stanford end in his day,
and a great pro football man as well,
who has been polishing and work
ing hard with his men.
Moscrip Shines
The most conspicuous is Jim
"Monk" Moscrip, former Kiski prep
ace, who in his first varsity game
stepped into the limelight as one of
the Pacific Coast's leading ends.
Terrifically speedy (he is rated the
fastest man in football on the Coast),
he has been outstanding in every
game with his spectacular, daring
play.
Watch Moscrip tomorrow going in
on the kickers and you will see
what, a beating a man can take and
come up smiling for more. At Los
Angeles two weeks ago it was Mos
crip who was responsible for keep
ing little Irv Warburton, the Trojan
quarter, well in check on his punt
returns.

♦ At right end A1 Norgard attracts
I the sports writers' attention less,
I but he completes probably the best
end combination since the days of
Lawson and Ted Shipkey. Norgard
is an artist at piling up the oppos
ing interference in tight knots, and
he teams admirably with defensive
halfback Bob Hamilton in stopping
everything that comes to the right
j of the Stanford line.
; At ends for the Golden Bear are
a number of men, none of whom are
especially distinguished, but they
are ail good hardy boys. Jim Mc-
Cormick and Harry Jones have been
1 starting most games, but the Brit
i tingham brothers, Bob and Jack,
| who began the season on the Ram
i biers, have come to the fore with
,| a bang of late. They opened last
| week's fray with Idaho, and will
probably see some action tomorrow.
Tackles are plentiful at the Ber
| keley school. Johnny Ransome, who
, i was being boomed for All-Coast and
even All-American before the sea
; | son started, has been hurt most of
j the year, but his position has been
adequately filled by Lawrence Lutz,
I a 205 - pounder from last year's
I freshmen. Harnessed with him at
i right tackle is 210-pound Bill Boone,
: a veteran and a good one.
U.C. Tackles
Lutz and Boone were outstanding
! against the Trojans, staving off the
power threats developed by Head
man Jones. It was not their fault
that the mighty mite Warburton
bioke loose for 59 yards and won
the game late in the third quarter.

Los Angeles showing.
"5 and 10" Twins
Bob O'Connor is a newcomer who
has earned a place as running mate ,
for Cobrus. In second string are a
couple of sophomores, the so-called
"5 and 10" boys, Larry Rouble and
Woody Adams, both from San Fran
cisco.
They have sparked up the offense
on every occasion they could get in
the game, and some astute observers
went so far as to suggest that they
run interference better than do
either of the veterans. Behind them
in third string are Ted Kite and
Bruce Tarver, a couple who could
be playing regular in most colleges.
Kite and Tarver
Kite was regular starter last sea
son, and was in there at the open
ing of the Big Game in 1932. The
same astute observers noted above
have been holding bull sessions
since October 1. asking each other
why Ted Kite does not get into the
ball game. Bruce Tarver is a hard
working man who deserves a break
and has never got it.
Christie vs. Muller
At center, the Bears have the
great Red Christie, who pops out
with a world beating game every
once in a while. He knocked down
everything against S.C., and made
Rosy Rosenberg pale in comparison.
But he will find an able match in
Stanford's 217-pound Wes Muller,
who has only started one game, but
that was the recent Trojan fracas.
Muller, too, made Rosenberg look
mild, and it appeal's as if a battle of
centers comparable to the memo
rable duel of Walt Heineke and Roy
Riegels were on tap. Stanford has
Bill Bates, who may possibly start
the game because of his experience
and ability defending against passes,
and Muller and Bates ought to give
the Red a near stand-off. Alf Bran
din and Lee Blanchard will be avail
able for the Indians, and Russ Cal
kins will bolster the Bear center.
Now the Backs
Moving into the Card backlield
(where we hope those Bears WON'T
be moving tomorrow), we find the
array of backs almost dazzling.
There has been justification for the
declaration this year that Thornhill
has more backs than he knows what
to do with.
The situation is so complex that
Corcli Thornhill has had veteran
Bill Sim, last year's All-Coast left
half, playing every place but full
back. And bashing Jack Hiilman,
the veteran fullback, has to take a
second place this year.
The men who have bloomed this
year include Bob Hamilton, right
half, a natural defensive man, a
great blocker, and a hard driving,
smart ball carrier. He is another of
the Kiski crew who made the 1932
freshmen, great. Behind him are
Chuck White and Kenny Affler
baugh, both letter men, hard work
ers, and artistic performers.
Afflerbaugh is apt to break up the
game with a long run to touchdown
at any moment; White is less spec
tacular, but he is reliable, and
steady.
At left half the parade opens with
Bob Maentz, a triple threat man
who plays safety and shares most
of the ball toting with the fullback.
"Buck Van Dellen, by sheer bril
liance in the last three games, has
achieved a place that may blossom
into the starting i.ssignment against
the Golden Bear. Van Dellen is ac
counted the most artful safety on
the squad, and the two passes he
caught on the memorable (57-yard
drive to the touchdown against Troy
really set Stanford up for the score.
Johnny Reisner has been handi
capped with injuries of late, but he
can kick better than most people
think; he is a whirling dervish in
the open field, one of the type that
wins ball games .it any casual mo
ment.

Shelly Bronstein is the latest find 1
at this position, and his masterly
treading of the tight rope against 1
Montana last week was indeed i
beautiful to behold.
At quarterback is perhaps the 1
most colorful of the Stanford back
lield, chunky Frank Alustiza, "Little
Boom," "Poncho," "The Bounding
Basque of Stockton," "The Owl-
Eyed Terror," or what have you?
Frankie started this season as a j
fullback, and v/as gracing the bench
k;r too many games.
Someone had 'an inspiration and i
made a quarterback of him, and he
is to the manor born. His 190 pounds
of speed bowls over the opposing
ends with eclat, viz. Captain Ford
Palmer of U.S.C.
Quick Kick Artist
His real specialty, however, is
quick kicking, and he rates with the
best on the Coast. His kicks get
away in surprisingly short time,
barely clearing the backs of the
linemen, but they straighten out and
just sail along, a few feet off the
ground. His coffin-corner kicking
against Troy was a neat bit of work.
Besides, this youth can snag a
pass or throw one with the best of
them, and he is not at all slow in
the open field.
Of Bobby Grayson, ten miles of
newsprint has probably been writ
ten, and he deserves most of it.
Fast and daring, he must be the
spark plug of the Indian attack j
tomorrow. Around the ends, under i
the middle, slashing off tackle, pass
ing, he was great against Troy, and
he must be great to stampede Cali
fornia.
Hiilman and Hoos
Jack Hiilman, his substitute, is a j
veteran who has everything that j
Grayson has except his speed. Earl j
Hoos will do the subbing for Alus- I
tiza if the latter goes out of the '
game. Hoos is a sophomore, and he l
can call a daring game. No poor
blocker, he relishes intercepting a
pass.
California has a number of excel
lent backs, all good, but no stand
outs save Arleigh Williams, triple
threat left half who has inherited
Hank Shaldach's old job. Williams
is an expert place - kickex 1 , made
three points against S.C. that way, !
and has converted successfully on J
eight attempts this season.
He does the large share of ball I
carrying, and has a good yardage
average for the year.
Bcrtoli Injured
Floyd Blower is Williams' best
sub; he is from the 1932 freshmen,
but has been injured and may not
play. Chili Bertoli is another half of
whom great things were expected,
but injuries have prevented him
from coming through. Phil Klein
and Chuck Cotton are a pair of con
verted fullbacks who may make the
team spark.
At fullback, Jim Keefer has been
doing the best work of the year.
Small for a fullback. Keefer makes
up for it in speed and drive. He is
a hard tackier, and dependable. A1
Thorell and Frank Walker are called
on if necessary; both are sopho
mores and look like comers.
Right half must be a good block
ing back on an Ingram team; George
Relies or Ken Moeller divide the
bill. Relies is from Sacramento J.C.
where he played with Bill Sim of
Stanford and Tony Beard, now o£
S.C.
Moeller was a team-mate with
Arleigh Williams on the 1931 great
freshman eleven, but he has never
had a good chance to shine.
Cal Quarterbacks
Quarterbacks include Joe Ver
ducci and Chuck Stewart. The lat
ter started the U.S.C. game and
brought the stands to their feet
when he dashed right through the
Trojans to a near touchdown on
the kick-off. Verducci is a stumpy
little fellow who plays a slam bang
game when they let him. Milo
Quisling is a San Mateo J.C. trans
fer who can do good work and may
get in the game.
This completes the list of men
who can be counted on to start or
substitute in the game. On paper
it looks as if the lines were fairly
well balanced; and the backfields,
favorable to Stanford.
However, paper advantgaes mean
nothing, and not until the last
whistle sounds will the fan know
whether superior physical ability or
superior mental set won the- game.
