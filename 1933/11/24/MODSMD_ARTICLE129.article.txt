# CAL'S PRACTICE ENDS, INGRAM LIKES INDIANS
## 
### Frank Orr 
Bill Ingram's Grizzlies went into
secret hibernation this week and
tapered off their practice sessions at
a light workout yesterday. Ingram,
former Annapolis star, is seeking to
find a line and backfield combina
tion to stop Tiny Thornhill's fleet
Cardinal backfield tomorrow and
win the biggest Big Game in years.
Bears Practice in Secret
Behind locked gates, watched only
by press representatives, the Bears
j went through their final workout
aided by information gained when
Ingram scouted the Stanford-Mon
; tana game, the first time in years
that the California coach has
watched the Indians' pre-Big Game
! showing.
The California coach came back
from his excursion to Stanford last
Saturday with spots before his eyes
—those spots being the speedy,
dashing backs of the Indian team.
"Man, what an array of talent,!"
the Bear coach ejaculated. "I've
never seen so many good backs
on one team in ali my life!" This
praise was esepcially significant in
that neither Grayson, Alustiza,
nor Hamilton played against Mon
tana.
The Stnaford line, ivavy Bill be
lieves, has been underrated albsea
son, or was as good as people said
they were Saturday evening after
the Stanford-U.S.C. game.
"Linemen of Ability"
"They certainly surprised me. I
hadn't expected to see quite as much
individual ability among the Stan
ford linemen as I saw in their Mon
tana game, even though I had had
reports all season," Ingram said.
"They have two sets of fine guards
in O'Connor and Coious, Rouble and
Adams, a quartet of strong tackles
|in Reynolds, Callaway, Holwerda,
' and Palamountain, and a pair of
! crack ends, Norgard and Moscrip.
The Stanford line compared most
favorably with Southern California's
forward wall, according to all re
| ports, but I frankly wasn't prepared
I to see quite as much as I saw at
Palo Alto last Saturday."
With these thoughts in mind, In
j gram put his squad through a stiff
workout Wednesday, and slacked
I down Thursday as the Bears
! reached the ultimate in preparation
! for Saturday's classic.
Hideout Today
This morning the squad had left
for their hideout, where they will
stay until almost game time Sat
urday, when they will pounce upon
the Indian camp, hoping to claw out
I a victory and stem the tide of the
| Cardinal Rose Bowl march.
Ingram, at California for the past
three years, has managed one win
! and one tie so far with Stanford.
. Usually noted for steadiness and
power rather than speed and shifti
ness, his 1933 backfieltl shows more
the deceptive tactics.
: The California backers will rely
more on line power and ability to
nail the Indian backs behind the
scrimmage marker tomorrow.
Undefeated, the Bears will seek to
1 preserve their clean slate for 1933
j and scalp the team that trounced
, U.S.C. A win for Stanford will vir
tually assure a bid to represent the
i West in the annual New Year's Rose
Bowl classic and serve to partially
i erase the memory of the mud bath

Bill Ingram's Grizzlies went into
secret hibernation this week and
tapered off their practice sessions at
a light workout yesterday. Ingram,
former Annapolis star, is seeking to
find a line and backfield combina
tion to stop Tiny Thornhill's fleet
Cardinal backfield tomorrow and
win the biggest Big Game in years.
Bears Practice in Secret
Behind locked gates, watched only
by press representatives, the Bears
j went through their final workout
aided by information gained when
Ingram scouted the Stanford-Mon
; tana game, the first time in years
that the California coach has
watched the Indians' pre-Big Game
! showing.
The California coach came back
from his excursion to Stanford last
Saturday with spots before his eyes
—those spots being the speedy,
dashing backs of the Indian team.
"Man, what an array of talent,!"
the Bear coach ejaculated. "I've
never seen so many good backs
on one team in ali my life!" This
praise was esepcially significant in
that neither Grayson, Alustiza,
nor Hamilton played against Mon
tana.
The Stnaford line, ivavy Bill be
lieves, has been underrated albsea
son, or was as good as people said
they were Saturday evening after
the Stanford-U.S.C. game.
"Linemen of Ability"
"They certainly surprised me. I
hadn't expected to see quite as much
individual ability among the Stan
ford linemen as I saw in their Mon
tana game, even though I had had
reports all season," Ingram said.
"They have two sets of fine guards
in O'Connor and Coious, Rouble and
Adams, a quartet of strong tackles
|in Reynolds, Callaway, Holwerda,
' and Palamountain, and a pair of
! crack ends, Norgard and Moscrip.
The Stanford line compared most
favorably with Southern California's
forward wall, according to all re
| ports, but I frankly wasn't prepared
I to see quite as much as I saw at
Palo Alto last Saturday."
With these thoughts in mind, In
j gram put his squad through a stiff
workout Wednesday, and slacked
I down Thursday as the Bears
! reached the ultimate in preparation
! for Saturday's classic.
Hideout Today
This morning the squad had left
for their hideout, where they will
stay until almost game time Sat
urday, when they will pounce upon
the Indian camp, hoping to claw out
