# WILBUR WARNS FARM AGAINST USE OF LIQUOR
## Circular Asks All Houses Comply to Rules 
### 
Drunkenness is considered suf
ficient grounds for expulsion from
the University.
The principal regulations of the
University are that no student
may bring liquor onto the campus j
or have it in his possession in his
living quarters.
The University assumes that the
act of registering as a student im
plies full acceptance of this policy.
Reminding students that these
statements will be fully upheld dur
ing Big Game week, University
leaders have sounded a warning to
all Stanfordites to observe local reg
ulations concerning alcohol.
In a genqral circular recently is- ;
sued, Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur asked
all students to be ' particularly care
ful to protect integrity as well as the
good name of their respective or
ganizations and of the University in
this important mattei*.
"The Big Game is a source of con
cern to those responsible for the j
good name of the University," the :
statement reads. "Members of the
student body participate in public
social gatherings in Los Angeles and
elsewhere.
Exciting Time
"Since it is a time of excitement
and enthusiasm which may easily j
lead to serious accidents and to acts,
careless or deliberate, on the part ,
of students which may affect not I
only the interests of the students
but also the good name of the Uni
versity, this word of caution is in !
order.''
