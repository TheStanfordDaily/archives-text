# Thornhill Grid Dynasty Looms
## 
### 
One California dynasty after an- j
j other has ruled Pacific Coast foot
ball, with occasional temporary in
i vasions from the north. "Smith,
Warner, Jones and Co." have lost
! the crown only to Washington and
: Washington State.
When intercollegiate battles rc
. turned after the war of 1914, the
California teams, under Andy
Smith, reached their greatest
heights, beating Stanford and ev
ery other opponent for five years ,
I straight.
With the advent of Glenn Scobey
j Warner at Stanford, a new era ;
dawned; after the smoke of the j
fiercest Big Game in years had
! rolled away the teams were dead
; locked in a 20 to 20 tie.
Price Takes Helm
The following year saw Andy
, Smith out of the picture, "Nibs"
Price at' the Bears' helm getting
scalped 27 to 14, and a horde of ;
Washington Huskies led by Wilson
and Tesreau and coached by Enoch
Bagshaw repelling the Indian sortie
jiinto the great north woods and get
| ting away with the title.
! "Pop" Warner then took cliarge
for the years 1926 and 1927, pro
ducing such stars as fullback Er- i
nie Ncvers, end Ted Shipkey, and
guards "Dynamite" Post and Don
Robesky, and beating the best the
East could offer. This little trick
of Warner's crops out often in
football annals.
Then came the long ascendancy of
the Thundering Herd of Trojan
horses, rounded up by Howard j
Jones. Tied for the pennant in 1927,
they ousted Stanford but had to
share one year with California. In
1930 only did they lose their iron
i grasp on the Conference leadership, '
when Washington State's Cougars
clawed them pretty badly.
Ingram Ends Losses
During this period of southern \
supremacy, Warner walloped Price
three times and tied once, winding i
up by setting an all-time record i
whitewash, 41-0, in 1930.
"Barnacle Bill" Ingram brought
relief to poor Cal in 1931 by turning
in a 6-0 victory in the Big Game at-j
Palo Alto, giving the Bears a chance
to work off long-held feeling by de
molishing goal posts. Next year the
' bouncing sailor boy "wrastled" a
scoreless tie out of one of the weak
est Indian teams in years. Warner j
sought greener pastures, disgusted j
by three losses and a tie.
Thornhill New Deal
Then came the revolution! A large
gentleman named Claude Thornhill
dug up some magic glue from some j
cache he had made during nine
years on the Farm and patched up j
the wobbly red machine with six ;
sophomores. U.S.C. was toppled
from its throne in decisive fashion,
with half Los Angeles watching.
A win over California will mark
the founding of a new dynasty, su- '
preme as long as the glue and the
sophomores hold out, and prospects
look pretty good for just that little I
thing to happen.
