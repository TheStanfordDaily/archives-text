to give it. The football squad dem
onstrates that a light afternoon's
practice is one of the best ways of
losing weight. Bill Corbus holds
the record, usually coming off the

when he went on. Bob Hamilton is
at the other end of the scale, as he
loses a mere pound of flesh a day to
the cause of football.
