# Triple Tie May Wind Up Coast Conference Race For Grid Title
## Oregon Leads Gridders With Four Wins, One Loss; Indians Close Behind With Three Wins, One Loss; Oregon Tie Eliminates Trojans 
### FRANK TREMAINE 
That the Pacific Coast Conference will wind up in a triple tic for the
mythical title seems a strong possibility with Stanford favored to take
California down the line tomorrow and U.S.C. expected to do likewise
with Washington in their game December f).
Today Oregon leads the parade with four games won and one lost,
while the Indians are close on their trail with three victories and one

♦defeat. The Trojans sport the same
I record with the addition of a tie
with Oregon State which would
: count them out of championship
| hopes if the title went on a percent
i age basis, but since it is decided by
public opinion, Troy must be con
sidered because of its victory over
j the previously undefeated Webfeet.
A victory for Stanford will lift the
Cards into a tie with Oregon, while
a defeat will dump them far down
the line into sixth place and leave
Oregon in the top position chal
lenged only by Southern California,
provided the former national cham
\ pions defeat the Huskies in Los An
geles next month. That seems high
ly probable considering the fact that
northern teams rarely do well in the
! southland.
Rose Bowl Chance
Tomorrow's feature attraction, of
j course, is the annual Stanford-Cali
j fornia battle and the football eyes
. of the nation will be focused on the
local stadium, for not only does the
Conference title hang in the balance
but in all probability a victoi'y for
the Indians will bring with it an in
vitation to represent the West in the
New Year's Day classic in the Rose
Bowl.
A Bear victory can do no more
; than lift California from fifth to
third position in the conference
standings, but it will almost cer
' tainly mean that the Pasadena in
vitation will go to some other team,
probably Oregon or U.S.C.
} Stanford's Conference record is
spoiled only by a muddy defeat at
the hands of Washington when Bill
! Smith kicked two field goals from a
sea of slime for six points on the
Husky side of the ledger. The In
dians hold Conference victories over
the mighty Trojan, the game which
was the highlight, of the season,
U.C.L.A., and Montana. In addition
Stanford tied Northwestern in an
I intersectional tiff, and defeated
U.S.F. and San Jose State.
Spotted Season
An in and out season has been the
lot of the California team which was
to be the most dangerous on the
; Coast and still can be considered
! such. Opening the season with a
disappointing 7 to 0 loss to Santa
, Clara, the Bears reversed their form
and overwhelmed California Aggies,
! eked out a 14 to 13 victory over St.
Mary's, trounced the Olympic Club,
tied Washington State G to 6, and
j then, after leading the Trojans for
three quarters, lost 6 to 3.
U.C.L.A. rose up in all its glory
j the following Saturday to hold its
I powerful big brother to a scoreless
' tie. Again reversing their form, the
Bears overwhelmed Washington 33
I to 0 and then barely squeezed out a
6 to 0 victory over Idaho last Sat
urday.
U.S.C.'s formerly mighty Trojans
j travel East to meet Notre Dame's
formerly mighty Ramblers today in
a battle for the "former great"
i championship of the country. Troy
' opened the season in its customary
i manner, bowling over its first four
opponents, Whitticr, Occidental,
Loyola, and Washington State in
easy fashion.
St. Mary's Falls
Then a powerful St. Mary's team
| fell at the walls of Troy 14 to 7, but
i on the following Saturday the whole
, football nation was shocked by the
' realization that U.S.C. had finally
been stopped when Oregon State,
j playing but eleven men throughout
i the game, held the Southern Cali
fornians to a scoreless tie. "Scooter"
1 Warburton staved off defeat against
j California with a brilliant 59-yard
1 run which brought a 6 to 3 victory,
, but Stanford's mighty sophomores
j finally ended the Trojan reign two
j weeks ago with a 13 to 7 defeat that
i is now history. Last Saturday U.S.C.
j started its comeback by trouncing
league-leading Oregon 26 to 0.
Another tradition - rich struggle
j features Coast football tomorrow
j when Washington and Washington
i State clash in the North. Heralded
! as one of the teams to beat at the
start of the season, the Staters have
t proved a disappointment, losing to
LJ.S.C. 33 to 0, Oregon State 2 to 0,
and tieing California 6 to 6. In their
other games the Cougars romped
over Puget Sound 56 to 0, squeezed
out 13 to 7 and 14 to 0 victories over
