# Cards, Bears Claim Seven All-Star Men
## 4 Indians May Be Named On Mythical Teams 
### Gray Creveling 
Between 'em, California and Stan- ;
ford can offer seven possible can
didates for the mythical All-Con
ference football team, and four to
the All-American squad.
California's Howard "Red" Chris
tie at center, Larry Lutz at left tac
kle, and Arleigh Williams at left j
halfback are three top-notchers who !
have shown up to greatest advan- j
tage in stiffest competition.
In the U.S.C. game it was these :
three golden ones who were indi- i
vidual stars for the Bears.
Red Christie's defensive play, rov- j
ing behind the line like S.C.'s Ro- |
senberg and Stanford's Wes Muller,
was called the best individual per
formance by Brick Morse, who be
lieved Christie even surpassed Sie- 1
mering of S.F.U.

Lutz Outstanding

Lutz, the tackle, who has been j
going into, each game soon after in
jured Captain Johnny Ransome has
seen to the coin tossing ceremony ;
and taken part in the kick-off play, :
reached his peak in that toughest j
of games for the Berkeley boys, i
Lutz, although he was one of the
men that had his hands momentarily ■
on Warburton when that tricky one l
scampered to the goal line, played a
steady game to open up holes and I
stop all other thrusts over his left |
side of the line.
Arleigh Williams, left halfback, ,
was the man who almost sewed up
the game for California when he j
booted the pigskin through the ;
white uprights game was two min
utes old. It was he who also took
out two men at a time when Chuck
Stewart was running the kickoff to
the Trojans' 20-yard line. Williams
was great offensively in this game
and all of California's other con
tests. Throughout the season he has
been among the first three top scor
ers on the Coast.
Williams, Christie Best
Williams and Christie are Califor
nia's two candidates for All-Ameri
can honors this year.
Over here on the "reservation"
we've got four of the boys who are
a cinch to make All-Coast Confer
ence.
Bobby Grayson, Bill Corbus, Monk
Moscrip, and Bones Hamilton have
played steadiest for the Indians.
Grayson's line plunging, signal
calling, passing, and wide end run
ning in every game he has played
have been nothing short of Ail-
American stuff, but if Bobby doesn't j
get on that team picked from men ;
throughout the nation, he'll be on
the All-Conference squad without a
doubt. Grayson played his best in
the S.C. game. Those Trojans just
bring out the best in a man.
Corbus a Cinch
Steady Bill Corbus, not always j
flashy but always consistent, was at
his best down south, too. No mat
ter where or what the play, Bill
was either on the bottom of the pile
or standing around to see that the
Trojan got no farther. Corbus is the
only man on the team on whom
All-American honors are a cinch to
fall.
Monk Moscrip, however, has
shown up to be the best end on the
Coast, and best on the Coast usu
ally means pretty good for we seem
to have the best teams in the U.S.
With no better right half on the
Coast than Bones Hamilton, Stan
ford will have one other of its boys
named on the Pacific Coast's star
team.
Grayson's All - American chances
are above those of any fullback with
the exception of Army's Buckler.
The Big Game will settle the issue
as far as Corbus and Grayson are
concerned, but if they don't make
one they'll make the other.

the game for California when he j
booted the pigskin through the ;
white uprights game was two min
utes old. It was he who also took
out two men at a time when Chuck
Stewart was running the kickoff to
the Trojans' 20-yard line. Williams
was great offensively in this game
and all of California's other con
tests. Throughout the season he has
been among the first three top scor
ers on the Coast.
Williams, Christie Best
Williams and Christie are Califor
nia's two candidates for All-Ameri
can honors this year.
Over here on the "reservation"
we've got four of the boys who are
a cinch to make All-Coast Confer
ence.
Bobby Grayson, Bill Corbus, Monk
Moscrip, and Bones Hamilton have
played steadiest for the Indians.
Grayson's line plunging, signal
calling, passing, and wide end run
ning in every game he has played
have been nothing short of Ail-
American stuff, but if Bobby doesn't j
get on that team picked from men ;
throughout the nation, he'll be on
the All-Conference squad without a
doubt. Grayson played his best in
the S.C. game. Those Trojans just
bring out the best in a man.
Corbus a Cinch
Steady Bill Corbus, not always j
flashy but always consistent, was at
his best down south, too. No mat
ter where or what the play, Bill
was either on the bottom of the pile
or standing around to see that the
Trojan got no farther. Corbus is the
only man on the team on whom
All-American honors are a cinch to
fall.
Monk Moscrip, however, has
shown up to be the best end on the
Coast, and best on the Coast usu
ally means pretty good for we seem
to have the best teams in the U.S.
With no better right half on the
Coast than Bones Hamilton, Stan
ford will have one other of its boys
named on the Pacific Coast's star
team.
Grayson's All - American chances
are above those of any fullback with
the exception of Army's Buckler.
The Big Game will settle the issue
as far as Corbus and Grayson are
concerned, but if they don't make
one they'll make the other.
Between 'em, California and Stan- ;
ford can offer seven possible can
didates for the mythical All-Con
ference football team, and four to
the All-American squad.
California's Howard "Red" Chris
tie at center, Larry Lutz at left tac
kle, and Arleigh Williams at left j
halfback are three top-notchers who !
have shown up to greatest advan- j
tage in stiffest competition.
In the U.S.C. game it was these :
three golden ones who were indi- i
vidual stars for the Bears.
Red Christie's defensive play, rov- j
ing behind the line like S.C.'s Ro- |
senberg and Stanford's Wes Muller,
was called the best individual per
formance by Brick Morse, who be
lieved Christie even surpassed Sie- 1
mering of S.F.U.

Lutz Outstanding

Lutz, the tackle, who has been j
going into, each game soon after in
jured Captain Johnny Ransome has
seen to the coin tossing ceremony ;
and taken part in the kick-off play, :
reached his peak in that toughest j
of games for the Berkeley boys, i
Lutz, although he was one of the
men that had his hands momentarily ■
on Warburton when that tricky one l
scampered to the goal line, played a
steady game to open up holes and I
stop all other thrusts over his left |
side of the line.
Arleigh Williams, left halfback, ,
was the man who almost sewed up
the game for California when he j
booted the pigskin through the ;

utes old. It was he who also took
