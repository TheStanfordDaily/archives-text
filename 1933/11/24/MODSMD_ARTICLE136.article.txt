# STANFORD AND BEARS FIGHTING FOR ROSE BOWL BID
## Indian Win May Get Invitation to New Year's Tilt No Undefeated, United Game Left on Coast to Play In Bowl Game; Army, Michigan, Princeton Rated Strongest Eastern Squad? 
### CHARLES CHAPPELL 
Football's fickle cycle having again swung through its coursc, Stan
ford's band of grid warriors once more arc in a favorable spot for the
coveted honor of representing the West in the annual Host; Bowl classic.
A victory over California will practically cinch (he choice in Stanford's
favor, while if the Golden Bears come through oir top the honor may

♦well go to Berkeley. For the first
time in years winning the Big Game
carries with it something more than
mere satisfaction at trouncing a tra
ditional rival.
Although an undefeated, untied
team is usually preferred for the
New Year's Day game, the topsy
turvy nature of the Pacific Coast
football season leaves not a single
major team in this part of the coun
try without a defeat chalked up
against it. The University of Oregon,
last Pacific Coast team with an un
blemished escutcheon, was trampled
26 to 0 last Saturday by the merci
less, sometimes Thundering Herd of
Southern California.
Northwest Out
Oregon's previous defeat of Ore
| gon State, who held S.C. to a 0-0
I deadlpck, and California's 33 to 0
i shellacking of Washington pretty
definitely eliminate the possibility
i of a Northwest team's being consid
! ered. Although Oregon still ranks
first in Conference standings, a
four-touchdown loss to S.C.'s de
feated eleven is too much of an
obstacle .to be blithely ignored. Be
sides, the Webfeet have yet to get
| by St. Mary's.
Coming back to Stanford's own
I fortunes, no one will be likely to
dispute the Indians' claim to being
j the best team in the West if they
take the Bears into camp tomorrow. ,
Stanford's loss to Washington and
tie with Northwestern just balances
S.C.'s single loss and tie. The fact
that the Trojans bowed 4d the In
dians, however, tips the scales heav- j
ily in Stanford's favor as far as
playing in the Rose Bowl is con
cerned.
Bears Redeemed
California's in and out season,
which includes defeats by S.C. and
Santa Clara and deadlocks with
Washington State and U.C.L.A.,
could easily be redeemed by a vic
tory tomorrow. The team that beat
the team that beat the Trojans 1
would have to be given serious con
sideration when the task of picking
the West's strongest squad is un
dertaken.
A tie, however, would still leave
the Indians in the most favorable
•pot with two ties and a defeat
against three ties and a defeat for
California. Nor would a deadlock
particularly favor S.C.'s chances, for
the 13 10 7 Stanford trouncing of
Troy will not soon be forgotten by
Coast grid fans. Also, with the Tro
jans having played the last two (
games, a little variety would prob- !
ably be appreciated by Rose Bowl 1
devotees.
Rumblings from the Eastern
gridiron front establish Army,
Princeton, and Michigan as the
strongest teams in that part of
the country. Michigan alone lias
a blot on her record in the shape
of a tie and near-defeat at the
hands of Minnesota. Despite this
blemished record, most critics rate
Michigan as easily the strongest |
team in that section, since the
Wolverines have faced far stiffcr
opposition than either Princeton
or Army.
Princeton, though untied and un
scored upon, has face'd no sterner a
test than that offered by Columbia,
Dartmouth, and Navy. Washington
and Lee gave the Tigers one of their
closest games, holding them to a 6-0
score. The Nassau Bengals have yet ;
to face Yale in one of those tradi- J
tional games that can easily result
in an upset. On the basis of. both
teams' games with Washington and
Lee, Yale boasts a one-touchdown
advantage.
Navy Looks Easy
Army has gotten by Illinois, Yale, \
and Harvard with Navy and Notre !
Dame yet to go. Navy should be |
easy for the soldiers, althotigh the ;
rejuvenated Notre Dame Ramblers
may very likely hand the Cadets an
upset. Army has the advantage of .
having trounced all their rivals by j
impressive scores, moving Eastern i
experts to rate them as about tv/o
touchdowns better than Princeton
although no direct basis of com
parison is available.
Michigan's famous "punt, pass,
and pray" team has the most im
pressive record of the three pos
sible choices, having marched
through Michigan State, Cornell,
Ohio State, Chicago, Illinois, and
lowa with the Minnesota tie halting
the advance for the first time in two •
years. Northwestern has yet to be ,
put out of the way, with the Wol
verines rated as quite capable of the :
job.
Post-Season Game Out
Obstacles immediately arise, hew
ever, when any one of the foregoing
trio is considered. The Army has a
rule against post-season contests, as
do the Big Three and the Big Ten. I
Such rules, however, must be taken '
with a large grain of salt, especially :
in these times when a lucrative Rose
Bowl contest would go far toward
filling any university's depleted cof
fers.
Just four years ago Army made a
late-December trip to the Coast to
take on Stanford without any very
Astringent objections being offered.
Harvard once played in the Rose
Bowl even though the aforemen
tioned Big Three ruling was in ef
fect at that time. Michigan could
probably get permission to play, i
having nearly secured it last year
only to have S.C. pull a coup d'etat
and invite Pittsburgh.
Duke Undefeated
Something must be said about
Duke, the South's only undefeated
team. A new university, just com
ing to the front in a football way,
Duke would not be very likely to
get Ihe bid, even though some East
ern sports writers have been boom- ,

I ing the Blue Devils for the nomi
nation. Most interesting fact about
Duke is that it is coached by Wallace
Wade, whose Alabama teams ran up
two wins and a tie in Rose Bowl
competition. Stanford was held to a
tie by the Crimson Tide in 1927 and
might like to get another crack at
a Wade-coached team.
Any of the possible choices, how
ever, would probably attract a great
deal of interest. Army would be a
colorful choice since glamour always
attaches to a service team. Prince
ton would be a popular choice since
the prestige once connected with a
Big Three eleven still clings. The
real gridiron classic of the year,
however, would probably occur if
Michigan were invited, since the
Wolverines are undoubtedly one of
the best teams in the nation.
Long years ago when the Tourna
ment of Roses and Stanford football
were just getting under way, Stan
ford met a Yost-coached Michigan
team and went down to a decisive
defeat, the great Willie Heston run
ning wild at the expense of the Car
dinal. A revival of this early ri
valry, considering the present-day
1 status of the two teams, would prob
! ably pack in the cash customers in
; the Rose Bowl.

the 13 10 7 Stanford trouncing of
Troy will not soon be forgotten by
Coast grid fans. Also, with the Tro
jans having played the last two (
games, a little variety would prob- !
ably be appreciated by Rose Bowl 1
devotees.
Rumblings from the Eastern
gridiron front establish Army,
Princeton, and Michigan as the
strongest teams in that part of
the country. Michigan alone lias
a blot on her record in the shape
of a tie and near-defeat at the
hands of Minnesota. Despite this
blemished record, most critics rate
Michigan as easily the strongest |
team in that section, since the
Wolverines have faced far stiffcr
opposition than either Princeton
or Army.
Princeton, though untied and un
scored upon, has face'd no sterner a
test than that offered by Columbia,
Dartmouth, and Navy. Washington
and Lee gave the Tigers one of their
closest games, holding them to a 6-0
score. The Nassau Bengals have yet ;
to face Yale in one of those tradi- J
tional games that can easily result
in an upset. On the basis of. both
teams' games with Washington and
Lee, Yale boasts a one-touchdown
advantage.
Navy Looks Easy
Army has gotten by Illinois, Yale, \
and Harvard with Navy and Notre !
Dame yet to go. Navy should be |
easy for the soldiers, althotigh the ;
rejuvenated Notre Dame Ramblers
may very likely hand the Cadets an
upset. Army has the advantage of .
having trounced all their rivals by j
impressive scores, moving Eastern i
experts to rate them as about tv/o
touchdowns better than Princeton
although no direct basis of com
parison is available.
Michigan's famous "punt, pass,
and pray" team has the most im
pressive record of the three pos
sible choices, having marched
through Michigan State, Cornell,
Ohio State, Chicago, Illinois, and
lowa with the Minnesota tie halting
the advance for the first time in two •
years. Northwestern has yet to be ,
put out of the way, with the Wol
verines rated as quite capable of the :
job.
Post-Season Game Out
Obstacles immediately arise, hew
ever, when any one of the foregoing
trio is considered. The Army has a
rule against post-season contests, as
do the Big Three and the Big Ten. I
Such rules, however, must be taken '
with a large grain of salt, especially :
in these times when a lucrative Rose
Bowl contest would go far toward
filling any university's depleted cof
fers.
Just four years ago Army made a
late-December trip to the Coast to
take on Stanford without any very
Astringent objections being offered.
Harvard once played in the Rose
Bowl even though the aforemen
tioned Big Three ruling was in ef
fect at that time. Michigan could
probably get permission to play, i
having nearly secured it last year
only to have S.C. pull a coup d'etat
and invite Pittsburgh.
Duke Undefeated
Something must be said about
Duke, the South's only undefeated
team. A new university, just com
ing to the front in a football way,
Duke would not be very likely to
get Ihe bid, even though some East
ern sports writers have been boom- ,

I ing the Blue Devils for the nomi
nation. Most interesting fact about
Duke is that it is coached by Wallace
Wade, whose Alabama teams ran up
two wins and a tie in Rose Bowl
competition. Stanford was held to a
tie by the Crimson Tide in 1927 and
might like to get another crack at
a Wade-coached team.
Any of the possible choices, how
ever, would probably attract a great
deal of interest. Army would be a
colorful choice since glamour always
attaches to a service team. Prince
ton would be a popular choice since
the prestige once connected with a
Big Three eleven still clings. The
real gridiron classic of the year,
however, would probably occur if
Michigan were invited, since the
Wolverines are undoubtedly one of
the best teams in the nation.
Long years ago when the Tourna
ment of Roses and Stanford football
were just getting under way, Stan
ford met a Yost-coached Michigan
team and went down to a decisive
defeat, the great Willie Heston run
ning wild at the expense of the Car
dinal. A revival of this early ri
valry, considering the present-day
1 status of the two teams, would prob
! ably pack in the cash customers in
; the Rose Bowl.
Football's fickle cycle having again swung through its coursc, Stan
ford's band of grid warriors once more arc in a favorable spot for the
coveted honor of representing the West in the annual Host; Bowl classic.
A victory over California will practically cinch (he choice in Stanford's
favor, while if the Golden Bears come through oir top the honor may

♦well go to Berkeley. For the first
time in years winning the Big Game
carries with it something more than
mere satisfaction at trouncing a tra
ditional rival.
Although an undefeated, untied
team is usually preferred for the
New Year's Day game, the topsy
turvy nature of the Pacific Coast
football season leaves not a single
major team in this part of the coun
try without a defeat chalked up
against it. The University of Oregon,
last Pacific Coast team with an un
blemished escutcheon, was trampled
26 to 0 last Saturday by the merci
less, sometimes Thundering Herd of
Southern California.
Northwest Out
Oregon's previous defeat of Ore
| gon State, who held S.C. to a 0-0
I deadlpck, and California's 33 to 0
i shellacking of Washington pretty
definitely eliminate the possibility
i of a Northwest team's being consid
! ered. Although Oregon still ranks
first in Conference standings, a
four-touchdown loss to S.C.'s de
feated eleven is too much of an
obstacle .to be blithely ignored. Be
sides, the Webfeet have yet to get
| by St. Mary's.
Coming back to Stanford's own
I fortunes, no one will be likely to
dispute the Indians' claim to being
j the best team in the West if they
take the Bears into camp tomorrow. ,
Stanford's loss to Washington and
tie with Northwestern just balances
S.C.'s single loss and tie. The fact
that the Trojans bowed 4d the In
dians, however, tips the scales heav- j
ily in Stanford's favor as far as
playing in the Rose Bowl is con
cerned.
Bears Redeemed
California's in and out season,
which includes defeats by S.C. and
Santa Clara and deadlocks with
Washington State and U.C.L.A.,
could easily be redeemed by a vic
tory tomorrow. The team that beat
the team that beat the Trojans 1
would have to be given serious con
sideration when the task of picking
the West's strongest squad is un
dertaken.
A tie, however, would still leave
the Indians in the most favorable
•pot with two ties and a defeat
against three ties and a defeat for
California. Nor would a deadlock
particularly favor S.C.'s chances, for

probably get permission to play, i
having nearly secured it last year
only to have S.C. pull a coup d'etat
and invite Pittsburgh.
Duke Undefeated
Something must be said about
Duke, the South's only undefeated
team. A new university, just com
ing to the front in a football way,
Duke would not be very likely to
get Ihe bid, even though some East
ern sports writers have been boom- ,

I ing the Blue Devils for the nomi
nation. Most interesting fact about
Duke is that it is coached by Wallace
Wade, whose Alabama teams ran up
two wins and a tie in Rose Bowl
competition. Stanford was held to a
tie by the Crimson Tide in 1927 and
might like to get another crack at
a Wade-coached team.
Any of the possible choices, how
ever, would probably attract a great
deal of interest. Army would be a
colorful choice since glamour always
attaches to a service team. Prince
ton would be a popular choice since
the prestige once connected with a
Big Three eleven still clings. The
real gridiron classic of the year,
however, would probably occur if
Michigan were invited, since the
Wolverines are undoubtedly one of
the best teams in the nation.
Long years ago when the Tourna
ment of Roses and Stanford football
were just getting under way, Stan
ford met a Yost-coached Michigan
team and went down to a decisive
defeat, the great Willie Heston run
ning wild at the expense of the Car
dinal. A revival of this early ri
valry, considering the present-day
1 status of the two teams, would prob
! ably pack in the cash customers in
; the Rose Bowl.
Football's fickle cycle having again swung through its coursc, Stan
ford's band of grid warriors once more arc in a favorable spot for the
coveted honor of representing the West in the annual Host; Bowl classic.
A victory over California will practically cinch (he choice in Stanford's
favor, while if the Golden Bears come through oir top the honor may

♦well go to Berkeley. For the first
time in years winning the Big Game
carries with it something more than
mere satisfaction at trouncing a tra
ditional rival.
Although an undefeated, untied
team is usually preferred for the
New Year's Day game, the topsy
turvy nature of the Pacific Coast
football season leaves not a single
major team in this part of the coun
try without a defeat chalked up
against it. The University of Oregon,
last Pacific Coast team with an un
blemished escutcheon, was trampled
26 to 0 last Saturday by the merci
less, sometimes Thundering Herd of
Southern California.
Northwest Out
Oregon's previous defeat of Ore
| gon State, who held S.C. to a 0-0
I deadlpck, and California's 33 to 0
i shellacking of Washington pretty
definitely eliminate the possibility
i of a Northwest team's being consid
! ered. Although Oregon still ranks
first in Conference standings, a
four-touchdown loss to S.C.'s de
feated eleven is too much of an
obstacle .to be blithely ignored. Be
sides, the Webfeet have yet to get
| by St. Mary's.
Coming back to Stanford's own
I fortunes, no one will be likely to
dispute the Indians' claim to being
j the best team in the West if they
take the Bears into camp tomorrow. ,
Stanford's loss to Washington and
tie with Northwestern just balances
S.C.'s single loss and tie. The fact
that the Trojans bowed 4d the In
dians, however, tips the scales heav- j
ily in Stanford's favor as far as
playing in the Rose Bowl is con
cerned.
Bears Redeemed
California's in and out season,
which includes defeats by S.C. and
Santa Clara and deadlocks with
Washington State and U.C.L.A.,
could easily be redeemed by a vic
tory tomorrow. The team that beat
the team that beat the Trojans 1
would have to be given serious con
sideration when the task of picking
the West's strongest squad is un
dertaken.
A tie, however, would still leave
the Indians in the most favorable
•pot with two ties and a defeat
against three ties and a defeat for
California. Nor would a deadlock
particularly favor S.C.'s chances, for
the 13 10 7 Stanford trouncing of
Troy will not soon be forgotten by
Coast grid fans. Also, with the Tro
jans having played the last two (
games, a little variety would prob- !
ably be appreciated by Rose Bowl 1
devotees.
Rumblings from the Eastern
gridiron front establish Army,
Princeton, and Michigan as the
strongest teams in that part of
the country. Michigan alone lias
a blot on her record in the shape
of a tie and near-defeat at the
hands of Minnesota. Despite this
blemished record, most critics rate
Michigan as easily the strongest |
team in that section, since the
Wolverines have faced far stiffcr
opposition than either Princeton
or Army.
Princeton, though untied and un
scored upon, has face'd no sterner a
test than that offered by Columbia,
Dartmouth, and Navy. Washington
and Lee gave the Tigers one of their
closest games, holding them to a 6-0
score. The Nassau Bengals have yet ;
to face Yale in one of those tradi- J
tional games that can easily result
in an upset. On the basis of. both
teams' games with Washington and
Lee, Yale boasts a one-touchdown
advantage.
Navy Looks Easy
Army has gotten by Illinois, Yale, \
and Harvard with Navy and Notre !
Dame yet to go. Navy should be |
easy for the soldiers, althotigh the ;
rejuvenated Notre Dame Ramblers
may very likely hand the Cadets an
upset. Army has the advantage of .
having trounced all their rivals by j
impressive scores, moving Eastern i
experts to rate them as about tv/o
touchdowns better than Princeton
although no direct basis of com
parison is available.
Michigan's famous "punt, pass,
and pray" team has the most im
pressive record of the three pos
sible choices, having marched
through Michigan State, Cornell,
Ohio State, Chicago, Illinois, and
lowa with the Minnesota tie halting
the advance for the first time in two •
years. Northwestern has yet to be ,
put out of the way, with the Wol
verines rated as quite capable of the :
job.
Post-Season Game Out
Obstacles immediately arise, hew
ever, when any one of the foregoing
trio is considered. The Army has a
rule against post-season contests, as
do the Big Three and the Big Ten. I
Such rules, however, must be taken '
with a large grain of salt, especially :
in these times when a lucrative Rose
Bowl contest would go far toward
filling any university's depleted cof
fers.
Just four years ago Army made a
late-December trip to the Coast to
take on Stanford without any very
Astringent objections being offered.
Harvard once played in the Rose
Bowl even though the aforemen
tioned Big Three ruling was in ef
fect at that time. Michigan could
probably get permission to play, i
having nearly secured it last year
only to have S.C. pull a coup d'etat

i of a Northwest team's being consid
! ered. Although Oregon still ranks
first in Conference standings, a
four-touchdown loss to S.C.'s de
feated eleven is too much of an
obstacle .to be blithely ignored. Be
sides, the Webfeet have yet to get
| by St. Mary's.
Coming back to Stanford's own
I fortunes, no one will be likely to
dispute the Indians' claim to being
j the best team in the West if they
take the Bears into camp tomorrow. ,
Stanford's loss to Washington and
tie with Northwestern just balances
S.C.'s single loss and tie. The fact
that the Trojans bowed 4d the In
dians, however, tips the scales heav- j
ily in Stanford's favor as far as
playing in the Rose Bowl is con
cerned.
Bears Redeemed
California's in and out season,
which includes defeats by S.C. and
Santa Clara and deadlocks with
Washington State and U.C.L.A.,
could easily be redeemed by a vic
tory tomorrow. The team that beat
the team that beat the Trojans 1
would have to be given serious con
sideration when the task of picking
the West's strongest squad is un
dertaken.
A tie, however, would still leave
the Indians in the most favorable
•pot with two ties and a defeat
against three ties and a defeat for
California. Nor would a deadlock
particularly favor S.C.'s chances, for
the 13 10 7 Stanford trouncing of
Troy will not soon be forgotten by
Coast grid fans. Also, with the Tro
jans having played the last two (
games, a little variety would prob- !
ably be appreciated by Rose Bowl 1
devotees.
Rumblings from the Eastern
gridiron front establish Army,
Princeton, and Michigan as the
strongest teams in that part of
the country. Michigan alone lias
a blot on her record in the shape
of a tie and near-defeat at the
hands of Minnesota. Despite this
blemished record, most critics rate
Michigan as easily the strongest |
team in that section, since the
Wolverines have faced far stiffcr
opposition than either Princeton
or Army.
Princeton, though untied and un
scored upon, has face'd no sterner a
test than that offered by Columbia,
Dartmouth, and Navy. Washington
and Lee gave the Tigers one of their
closest games, holding them to a 6-0
score. The Nassau Bengals have yet ;
to face Yale in one of those tradi- J
tional games that can easily result
in an upset. On the basis of. both
teams' games with Washington and
Lee, Yale boasts a one-touchdown
advantage.
Navy Looks Easy
Army has gotten by Illinois, Yale, \
and Harvard with Navy and Notre !
Dame yet to go. Navy should be |
easy for the soldiers, althotigh the ;
rejuvenated Notre Dame Ramblers
may very likely hand the Cadets an
upset. Army has the advantage of .
having trounced all their rivals by j
impressive scores, moving Eastern i
experts to rate them as about tv/o
touchdowns better than Princeton
although no direct basis of com
parison is available.
Michigan's famous "punt, pass,
and pray" team has the most im
pressive record of the three pos
sible choices, having marched
through Michigan State, Cornell,
Ohio State, Chicago, Illinois, and
lowa with the Minnesota tie halting
the advance for the first time in two •
years. Northwestern has yet to be ,
put out of the way, with the Wol
verines rated as quite capable of the :
job.
Post-Season Game Out
Obstacles immediately arise, hew
ever, when any one of the foregoing
trio is considered. The Army has a
rule against post-season contests, as
do the Big Three and the Big Ten. I
Such rules, however, must be taken '
with a large grain of salt, especially :
in these times when a lucrative Rose
Bowl contest would go far toward
filling any university's depleted cof
fers.
Just four years ago Army made a
late-December trip to the Coast to
take on Stanford without any very
Astringent objections being offered.
Harvard once played in the Rose
Bowl even though the aforemen
tioned Big Three ruling was in ef
fect at that time. Michigan could
probably get permission to play, i
having nearly secured it last year
only to have S.C. pull a coup d'etat
and invite Pittsburgh.
Duke Undefeated
Something must be said about
Duke, the South's only undefeated
team. A new university, just com
ing to the front in a football way,
Duke would not be very likely to
get Ihe bid, even though some East
ern sports writers have been boom- ,

I ing the Blue Devils for the nomi
nation. Most interesting fact about
Duke is that it is coached by Wallace
Wade, whose Alabama teams ran up
two wins and a tie in Rose Bowl
competition. Stanford was held to a
tie by the Crimson Tide in 1927 and
might like to get another crack at
a Wade-coached team.
Any of the possible choices, how
ever, would probably attract a great
deal of interest. Army would be a
colorful choice since glamour always
attaches to a service team. Prince
ton would be a popular choice since
the prestige once connected with a
Big Three eleven still clings. The
real gridiron classic of the year,
however, would probably occur if
Michigan were invited, since the
Wolverines are undoubtedly one of
the best teams in the nation.
Long years ago when the Tourna
ment of Roses and Stanford football
were just getting under way, Stan
ford met a Yost-coached Michigan
team and went down to a decisive
defeat, the great Willie Heston run
ning wild at the expense of the Car
dinal. A revival of this early ri
valry, considering the present-day
1 status of the two teams, would prob
! ably pack in the cash customers in
; the Rose Bowl.
Football's fickle cycle having again swung through its coursc, Stan
ford's band of grid warriors once more arc in a favorable spot for the
coveted honor of representing the West in the annual Host; Bowl classic.
A victory over California will practically cinch (he choice in Stanford's
favor, while if the Golden Bears come through oir top the honor may

♦well go to Berkeley. For the first
time in years winning the Big Game
carries with it something more than
mere satisfaction at trouncing a tra
ditional rival.
Although an undefeated, untied
team is usually preferred for the
New Year's Day game, the topsy
turvy nature of the Pacific Coast
football season leaves not a single
major team in this part of the coun
try without a defeat chalked up
against it. The University of Oregon,
last Pacific Coast team with an un
blemished escutcheon, was trampled
26 to 0 last Saturday by the merci
less, sometimes Thundering Herd of
Southern California.
Northwest Out
Oregon's previous defeat of Ore
| gon State, who held S.C. to a 0-0
I deadlpck, and California's 33 to 0
i shellacking of Washington pretty
definitely eliminate the possibility
i of a Northwest team's being consid
! ered. Although Oregon still ranks
first in Conference standings, a
four-touchdown loss to S.C.'s de
feated eleven is too much of an
