# Fighters Lose Four Veterans
## Entries Sign for University Boxing Tournament 
### 
With only four returning letter
men, Coach Myron Schall is faced
1 this year with the problem of turn
ing out a boxing team from compar
atively green material. However,
there has been a large turnout of
promising beginners and as the first
team competition does not take place
until winter quarter there is ample
time to build a squad of boxers.
Stu Stevens, lightweight; Waldo
Munday, junior middleweight; John
Fowier, middleweight, and Ben
Cave, welterweight, are the letter
men who are expected to turn out
this season. Keith Topping, another
last year's letterman, is not expected
to report because he will be enrolled
j in the basketball department.
Veterans Graduate
Graduation robbed Stanford of
several first-class boxers when Glo
ver, Feeling, Baer, Imai, Johnson,
Ridley, and Johnston were given
j their diplomas last spring. Bob
I Quinn was lost to the Stanford team
when he transferred to McGill this
year. Loss of these exeprienced
boxers has left the Card leather
pushers greatly weakened.
Physical condition is being
sti'essed in the daily workouts of
those planning to enter the All-
University Boxing Tournament to
be held December 5 and which is
the big event of the autumn quar
ter. Thirty-two beginners have al
: ready signed for this annual tour
nament.
