# Number '1' Reserved For Ail-American Nevers
## 
### 
Cardinal rooters never see the
number "1" on the jersey of one of j
the Stanford football players. Rea
son: Ernie Nevers, the Farms'great- '
est All-American. Nevers always
wore the numeral and when he
graduated it was decreed that no
other player was ever to be allowed
to wear it.
The case is similar to that of Illi
nois' famous "Galloping Ghost," Red !
Grange, and tho number "77" he
always wore.
