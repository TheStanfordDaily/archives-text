# Blazin' Ben To Run for O.A.C. In 1934 Season
## 
### 
Two post-graduate heroes of the
Stanford track definitely will not
compete; and one alumnus, possibly
best known of the trio, will wear
club colors during the 1934 on
slaught on world's records.
Blazin' Ben Eastman, iron man of
many a meet, and recognized world
record holder in the quarter- and
half-mile runs, announced yester
day that he will stretch his career
through at least one more season.
Les Hables, Hard Luck Abe of
two years ago, but Good Luck Abe
of last year, joined with Bill Miller
in announcing a definite decision to
discontinue competitive track. Mil
ler's announcement came as a com
parative surprise three weeks ago.
Eastman reached the peak of his
career in the middle of the 1932
season, when he ran the 440-yard
dash in 46.4 seconds to chop an en
tire second from a time-worn world
speed mark. He came back several
weeks later to complete the half
mile in 1:50.9 for another world's
record.
From that time on, Eastman was
bothered with illness and injuries.
He successfully defended his title
in the I.C.A.A.A.A. half mile, but
lost to Bill Carr, destined to be
listed among Pennsylvania track
immortals, in a gruelling one-lap
event. Carr again defeated Big Ben
in the Olympic trials and in the
finals.
A leg injury early last year forced
Eastman into the background, but
he now believes the limb to be get
ting back into shape. He will en
deavor to re-smash both middle
distance records, competing under
Olympic Club colors.
Eastman has been working out
regularly on Angell Field, running
the dashes in inter-squad meets for
the purpose of building up his fin
ish.
Hables said, "I definitely will not
compete under any club colors this
year." The sprinting star remarked
that he plans to work out occa
sionally, "helping the younger fel
lows when I can." The A.S.S.U. stu
dent manager is especially interested
in the work of Carlton Thorns, jun
ior college transfer who has shown
exceptional speed in the short races.
Like Eastman, Hables also was
hampered by injuries and illness
during a great part of his career.
He recovered sufficiently last year,
however, to play hero by capturing
both dashes in the grst U.S.C. dual
meet.
Miller, Olympic champion pole
vaulter, formally decided to quit
competitive track early this month.
He plans to work out occasionally,
and he is expected to press Bud
Deacon to teh limit in a few Friday
meets.
