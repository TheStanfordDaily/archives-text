# Pre-Seasonal Basketballers Show Up Well
## 
### 
If pre-season showings of an in
experienced squad are at all re
liable, Stanford during the coming
year will continue its three-year
struggle to regain a top position on
the Coast Intercollegiate basketball
ladder and will close the 1934 sea
son a few notches higher than 1933
left them; but whether Coach John
Bunn during the few months be
tween now and February can mould
' together a smooth-working quintet
from J.C. transfers, two or three
returning veterans, and last year's
subs that can overcome the return
! ing power of U.S.C., U.C.L.A., or Cal
appears far from certain.
First String Combination
During the past week Bunn has
i spent considerable time with a first
string combination consisting of
Cowing and Anderson, Moran and
Menlo transfers, as forwards; Jen
kins, another Menloite, at center;
and Cosgrove and Farber, up from
the frosh, at the guard posts. Cap
tain-elect Harold Edelen, his bad
knee once again on the mend, is due
to take over the center job once he
gets into condition. At present still
out for football, Keith Topping,
Stanford's scoring threat of last
year, is scheduled to use his lanky
reach to jump center, then move
to forward where his reliable eye
should once again give opposing
guards plenty of trouble.
The loss through ineligibility of
A1 Norgard, who was elected captain
of the '32 varsity only to leave
school, sent Card hopes to a new
low, but the chance that Frenchy La
Combe, a flashy guard of three years
ago, may register again will in a
large measure make up for the loss
of Norgard. What a combination if
both were back!
Bunn is fairly well set with re
serves, with Paige and Malatratt,
guards, and Shreve and Fuller, for
wards, on hand.
In comparison, the Trojans, 1932
winners, are not only fixed with re
turning veterans, have lost only
tricky Jerry Nemer, are also bol
j stored by considerable new mate
rial. The first five will be sorely fa
miliar as a high-scoring, hard-play
ing outfit to other conference teams:
Elliott and Browning, forwards;
Cuttero, center; and Bescoes and
Kelley, guards. U.C.L.A., too, can
hardly be weaker than their last
season five, with Piper, Johns,
Lempke, and Brotemarkle all re
turning.
Cal's hopes are teetering precari
ously in the balance with big Dave
Meek, ace center, still handicapped
by a badly injured leg. Hal Eiffert.

If pre-season showings of an in
experienced squad are at all re
liable, Stanford during the coming
year will continue its three-year
struggle to regain a top position on
the Coast Intercollegiate basketball
ladder and will close the 1934 sea

left them; but whether Coach John
Bunn during the few months be

from J.C. transfers, two or three
returning veterans, and last year's
subs that can overcome the return

appears far from certain.
First String Combination
During the past week Bunn has
i spent considerable time with a first
string combination consisting of
Cowing and Anderson, Moran and
Menlo transfers, as forwards; Jen
kins, another Menloite, at center;
and Cosgrove and Farber, up from
the frosh, at the guard posts. Cap
tain-elect Harold Edelen, his bad
knee once again on the mend, is due
to take over the center job once he
gets into condition. At present still
out for football, Keith Topping,
Stanford's scoring threat of last
year, is scheduled to use his lanky
reach to jump center, then move
to forward where his reliable eye
should once again give opposing
guards plenty of trouble.
The loss through ineligibility of
A1 Norgard, who was elected captain
of the '32 varsity only to leave
school, sent Card hopes to a new
low, but the chance that Frenchy La
Combe, a flashy guard of three years
ago, may register again will in a
large measure make up for the loss
of Norgard. What a combination if
both were back!
Bunn is fairly well set with re
serves, with Paige and Malatratt,
guards, and Shreve and Fuller, for
wards, on hand.
In comparison, the Trojans, 1932
winners, are not only fixed with re
turning veterans, have lost only
tricky Jerry Nemer, are also bol
j stored by considerable new mate
rial. The first five will be sorely fa
miliar as a high-scoring, hard-play
ing outfit to other conference teams:
Elliott and Browning, forwards;
Cuttero, center; and Bescoes and
Kelley, guards. U.C.L.A., too, can
hardly be weaker than their last
season five, with Piper, Johns,
Lempke, and Brotemarkle all re
turning.
Cal's hopes are teetering precari
ously in the balance with big Dave
Meek, ace center, still handicapped
by a badly injured leg. Hal Eiffert.
