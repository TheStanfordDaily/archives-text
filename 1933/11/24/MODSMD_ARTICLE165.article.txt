# "33 GOLF TEAM BETTER BALANCED"-COACH TWIGGS
## 
### M. JACK NEWMAN 
Loudly berating the lack of interest in golf during the fall quarter,
dapper golf coach Eddie Twiggs yesterday forecast a brilliant season for
the* team if they do not allow themselves to decay during the fall quar
ter's inactivity.
Of lite team, coach Twiggs said. "This year's team is not as brilliant
us last It ut much better balanced."
In the number one position is Lawson Little, ace of all Coast golf and
semi-finalist in the National Amateur Championship, winner of Colorado
Open and Amateur. Little is by far the outstanding West Coast golfer at
the present time. ,
In the number two position is Don Edwards, no longer an unproven
enthusiastic freshman but a steady, hard-hitting, competition-proven goif
er of the first rank. Edwards during the summer annexed the Claremont
Invitational, and has in (lie last few weeks won the San Jose champion
ship from a field that included Charlie Ferrera, two-time National Public
Links champion.

Edwards was one of the players
in the National Amateur and won
considerable recognition by tying for
third qualifying position with Open
Champion Johnny Goodman on the
first day of the play.
Iloerner Third on Ladder
In the third position is Jack Hoer
ner, big, long driving, and expe
rienced. Early this season, Coach
Twiggs thought Jack was hitting his
shot far above the team average.
This summer Jack played in the Na
tional Amateur, the Midwest Open,
and the Nebraska State Open tour
nament.
The fourth position is filled by the
less experienced but nevertheless
capable Dick Giddings. This is
Dick's final year of varsity golf. Last
year he played the number five po
sition.
(Jeer Loses to Giddings, Fifth
Behind Giddings is Jack Geer who
fell into that position by losing a
recent ladder match to Giddings.
Gcer is a good, steady, all-round
golfer who seems to be just coming
into his own.
Morse Erskine, who despite the
fact that he always has something
"fundamentally wrong" with his
swing, makes the sixth position look
like a fort. A former frosh football
star, Erskine can match mashies
with any of the others on the team.
Thompson Shoots 70
Bob Thompson, demure San Fran
ciscan, holds the next berth and woe
be it to the Cal man who meets him
on his hot day. During this last
week Thompson, who owing to his
progi am of studies has been playing
little, carded a magnificent 70, one
under perfect figures for the Farm
course.
Pacific Coast Intercollegiate cham
pion Gene Brown is playing the
eighth position this year and looks
as though he will rise considerably
on the ladder before the competi
tive season begins. Brown recently
recorded ihe second hole in one iri
the history of the Stanford links.
Long Driver Hoelle Improves
Bill Hoelle, stout and long driving,
is in the next position. Bill seems
to have been off his game in the
early season but has returned to his
old perfection. Bill made a blaze of
glory for himself this summer at the
State Amateur championship at Del
Monte.
Wilshire Country Club's contribu
tion to Stanford golf. Bill Shepherd,
has slipped on the golf ladder mis
erably since a strong start at the
beginning of the season which
placed him in a tv/o-way tie with
Brown in the qualifying. A badly
strained wrist seems responsible for
the relapse.
Dwyer, Moser Complete List
Tom Dwyer and Dan Moser finish
the formidable balanced list of the
varsity men. Both have had con
siderable experience. Tom was med
alist in the Pacific Coast Intercol
legiate last winter. Dan is a trans
fer from Williams Junior College,
has a marvelous future. He recently
scored a 68 on his home course,
Orinda, which is no snap.
Previously unmentioned and in
eligible for the Stanford team this
year is Spec Stewart, potentially
one of the greatest junior golfers of
the country. Present holder of the
Southwestern Championship, Stew
art is truly great. During his short
time in this part of the country,
Spec has made a name for himself
by defeating "Auld Hohn" Black,
dean of all Bay region golf profes
sionals, in the recently played
Northern California Open Cham
pionship.
Stewart Also Tennis Star
