# Indian Bowl Holds 87,400
## 
### 
Close to 87,500 grid enthusiasts
will see the Pacific Coast's blue rib
bon classic tomorrow, if the Stan
ford Stadium is filled to capacity, 1
as late pre-game ticket reports in
dicate it will.
Stamping grounds of the Indians
where Coach Thornhill's varsity
rules supreme will hold 7,500 more !
spectators than will the classic bowl
of the Blue and Gold gridders.
Cal Added Seats to Its Bowl
Back in pi;e-depression days the
California powers bemoaned the
lack of seats and added a few thou- '
sand bleachers around the rim. At- I
tendance on Tightwad Hill fell off j
but so did the attendance inside the I
bowl. Days of the big football J
crowds were past.
A few years back Stanford was!
faced with the need for an increased I
seating capacity in her semi-horse
shoe shaped stadium. The problem
was solved by installing new seats
and increasing the original number
in the process.
Stanford Has Own Public Address
Stanford's loudspeaker announc- j
ing system, manned by publicity j
man Don Liebendorfer, is one of j
two operated by major California j
universities in connection with their ,
playing stadium. The Memorial
Coliseum in Los Angeles has a
speaker system in conjunction with |
stadium facilities though at Califor- !
nia athletic heads have to depend on
the equipment of amplifying com
panies or other large Coast com
panies. Kezar Stadium in San Fran- 1
cisco is also forced to depend on the |
facilities of independent business
organizations.
