# BASEBALLERS SET TO END CALIFORNIA RULE OF DIAMOND
## 
### Frank Tremaine 
Determined to end California's su
premacy over California intercol
legiate baseball, Stanford diamond
men are already working out in
preparation for the season which
starts in the middle of winter quar
ter.
Nine lettermen head the squad of
forty-odd players practicing three
days a week under Coach Harry
Wolter. In addition there are a
number of valuable reserve men
from last year's squad and some
promising sophomores.
Seven Possible Ilurlers
With six pitchers available Stan
ford should be strong in the box
next season. Stan Anderson, who
was unable to play last season, looks
as though he would regain the form
that made him so dangerous two
years ago. Fred Heringer, one of the
leading hurlers on the second place
1933 Indian team, is back for his
second year. "Lefty" Campbell and
A1 Semmelroth are also back while
Eliot "Tough" Blanchard, one of last
year's frosh twirlers, shows promise.
Jim Massey will probably take
care of the other end of the bat
tery assignment, backed up by Oct
Morgan, sophomore.
Two lettermen will fight it out for
first base with the possibility that
I sophomore Bob Grayson or a junior
transfer may sneak in ahead of
them. Gordy Mallatratt and Art
Hearn are the block men who ai'e
back, although neither are out yet,
and Bud Wilson and Bob Harvey
are the transfers.
Woolley at Second
At second base Jim Wooiley, re
turning letterman, has the inside
! track with Ted Leidig, a brilliant
1 fielder, furnishing most of the com
, petition. Student body president
Jerry Trautman will probably hold
down third base for his third season,
backed up by Ray Forsythe, another
letterman, although the latter may
i see service in the outfield also.
Burt Delmas' old job at short will
be taken care of by one of three
sophomores, Ed Clark or Ed Gal-
I braith from last year's frosh or
"Hank" Edwards, a transfer from
San Jose.
Captain Dick Miles heads the list
I of outfielders with Fred Maggiora
1 as the only other letter winner re
turning for outpost duty. However,
several of last season's reserves are
available in the persons of Lowell
Nutting and Jim Neuman, and
i"Bones" Hamilton and Jim Moscrip,
the big punch in the frosh line-up
last season, will be out as soon as
they shelve their football suits.
Hard Hitting Club
The Indians should take the field
with a hard hitting club with the
big bats of Miles, Woolley, Malla
tratt, Massey, Hamilton, and Mos
crip booming basehits. The biggest
loss to the squad is the graduation
of Burt Delmas who set a new Cali
fornia intercollegiate batting mark
last season before he went to Brook
lyn in the National League at the
! close of school.
