# CARDS WIN FIRST CALIFORNIA GAME WITH 14-10 SCORE
## 
### 
Less biy but not less exciting than
tomorrow's game, was the first Big
Game on March 19, 1892, when Stan
ford played her first inter-collegiate
football contest defeating the Uni
! versity of California 14 to 10.
Excited, elated. J. F. Wilson wrote
1 in the campus publication, Sequoia:
j "At the grounds was a sight long to
(be remembered. Fully 5,000 people
saw the game. The adherents of the
two Universities kept together in
j separated bodies. . . .
Forgotten Football
"Considerable delay was caused
I through the neglect of bringing a
! football to the field, but the crowd
waited good naturedly. The team
lined up in their respective posi
tions at 4:15." He did not mention
the announced starting time.
The game was played on the
! Haight'Street Grounds in San Fran
| cisco.
Instead of the plather given to
j the press today by coaches striving
j to create a favorable "psychology"
! for their teams, statements were
| honest and straight from the shoul
i der. Stanford's captain, J. K. Whit-
I temore, commented:
Boys too Green
"I'm afraid our boys are too green
i for the U.C.'s. They have never
I played an intercollegiate game, and
I don't know how they will play."
i "Quite in contrast was the over
| weening confidence of the Califor
| nia captain," as the student chron
icler phrased it. "The Stanford team
j are kids. They play fair football but
i they can't do anything against us."
However, after the defeat of Cal,
! the Stanford writers had the gratifi
cation of replying, in effect, "ha, ha,
' Mr. Smarty" or whatever they said
in the nineties. Another writer, not
Wilson, gleefully penned: "We real
j ize that it must be extremely hu
| miliating to the oldar institution to
| be defeated by a college of freshmen
! (Stanford was that in 1892) and to
: lose the opportunity to sing all those
| funny songs and to give that funny
| yell."
Explains Why
Sports writers in the early days
• of Stanford journalism, made not
J only an effort to describe what hap
| pened but also to explain why "it
S happened. In "Sequoia" S. O. Briggs
j was praised for his work at left
! guard. And the reason for his suc
; cess was summarized—"lt is said
i that during the last five weeks he
j read Walter Camp's 'American Foot
| ball' five times and took notes."
A sporting event, the Big Game
j was not in origin, the social func
! tion that it has become today. The
i "girls" at Berkeley, it was reported
in California' "Occident," had a dif—
i ficult time deciding whether it was
j good form to go to foot ball (they
wrote it two words) game. Stanford
! women, however, attended in suffi
j cient numbers to be noticed and
i commended for their enthusiasm.
