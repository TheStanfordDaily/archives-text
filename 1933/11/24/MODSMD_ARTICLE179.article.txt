# BATES GOT CAUGHT
## 
### 
Fate was unkind to Bill Bates one
time when he was a frosh. Throw
ing eggs at a sponsors' meeting,
small Bill lit out when the elders
gave chase. But one of the finest
quarter milers Stanford has ever
had, track captain Johnny Morrison,
was then a sponsor, followed Sates,
hours resulting.
