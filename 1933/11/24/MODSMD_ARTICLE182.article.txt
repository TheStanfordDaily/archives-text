# FROSH GRIDDERS TURN IN AVERAGE SEASON RECORD
## 
### 
Starting oil with a bang and finishing up with more or less of a dull
lliud, Stanford's 1933 freshman football season in no way equaled last
year's highly successful one. To he entirely fair about the matter, how
ever, few yearling teams, even in the memory of the oldest inhabitant,
have measured up to last season's stellar aggregation.

Aside from this inevitable and un-<
fortunate comparison, the class of
'37 had a grid season no worse, per
haps a little better, than many oth
ers in freshman history. Four wins
and four losses, with two of the
latter four being near - victories,
sums up the net record of Coach
Jiinmie Bradshaw's charges.
Average Material
With only an average array of
material at the start of the season,
the 1933 yearlings will send no such
galaxy of stars up to the varsity as
moved up this year. Dale Beedle,
giant tackle and captain of the team,
looms as one of the most outstand
ing of the newcomers. A number of
other beefy young men who may
work their way to the top are Louis
Tsoutsouvas, Jack Walton, Mel Hur
ley, and Ray Williamson, all of
whom equal or approach the desir
able 200-pound mark. George Bcrg
man and Ralph Quails, though rath
er light, were a capable pair of cen
ters.
Lighter men on the squad will
probably be handicapped consider
ably when they are forced to com
pete with the husky lads already
holding down places on the varsity.
Walt Chouteau and Carl Schott,
both of whom weigh around 175,
formed a capable end combination
this year and may work into faster
company later,
Few Good Backs
Good backs, plentiful last year
to the point of plethora, were few
and fai' between on the present sea
son's squad. Biggest and most con
sistent ground - gainer was Chuck
Lcdbctter, 190-pound fullback, who
bowled over his opponents in no
uncertain fashion. A little polishing
up is thought to be about all this
line-plunger needs
Fred Williams, Colorado's triple
threat contribution to Stanford foot
ball, was one of the speediest men
on the squad, being particularly
good at skirting the ends and always
dangerous in an open jield. His 175
pounds of weight put him well out
of the pony-back class. Kicking
field goals was Williams' specialty,
his touchdown conversions being the
slender margin of victory in the first
two games of the season.
Turrctto Long Punter
Grigo Turretto was easily the best
punter on the squad, his spirals
soaring out around 50 or 55 yards
quite consistently. Joe Vigna and
Al Brent were a speedy pair of ball
carriers, but both are handicapped
by lack of brawn, a necessary ad
junct to varsity play.
Beginning the season in an im
pressive fashion, the yearlings nosed
out the powerful San Mateo Junior
College team by a 7-G scoi'e for an
unexpected victory. The following
week's game found Coach Brad
shaw's boys again scoring a 7-G win,
this time at the expense of Modesto
Jaysee.
Armstrong Smeared
An easy breather with Armstrong
Business College gave the freshmen
a chance to run riot to the tune of
56 points against none for the visi
tors. After taking 1 Armstrong in
stride, the Babes journeyed down
to Los Angeles where they played
one of the best games of the season
against the S.C. Trojans, only to lose
6-3 as the result of a lucky last
minute pass.
Decisively out-gaining the Tro
babes, the Indians clearly had the
upper hand throughout the game.
Fred Williams, besides piling up a
large part of his team's yardage,
kicked the field goal that seemed
enough to win until the afore-men
tioned last-minute pass upset things".
Letting down the following week,
the frosh dropped a sloppily played
game to Menlo J.C. by a 12-8 count.
Underrating Menlo's strength and
poor pass defense combined to spell
defeat for the Babes.
A powerful, big and speedy Santa
Clara freshman outfit put on a sc
ries of consistent drives the next
Saturday to steamroller the Cards
27 to 0. Although rolling up an im
pressive yardage total themselves,
the Indians could not convert it into
game-winning touchdowns.
Taking it easy in a pre-Little Big
Game breather with San Jose, the
Babes contented themselves with
winning by a 14-6 score.
U.C. Game Close
Facing a much-improved Califor
nia yearling team in the annual Lit
tle Big Game, Stanford went down
1o a 19-14 defeat after giving the
Cubs a stiff battle all the way. Elder
fell on a blocked punt to score one
touchdown lor Stanford while Joe
Vigna returned a California kick
off for a sensational touchdown run
from behind his own goal-line. Led
better broke loose in the last few
seconds of play for a 40-yard gain
and a near-touchdown only to be
overhauled just as the final gun
sounded.
