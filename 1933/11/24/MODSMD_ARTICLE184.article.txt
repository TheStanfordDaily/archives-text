# Cross-Country Run Scheduled
## 
### 
A genuine treat is in store fo.r
anyone and everyone who happens
to be in the country adjacent to
the Stanford golf course Saturday
morning when some of the best dis
tance men on the coast, representing
the Universities of Stanford and
California, meet to decide both in
dividual and team supremacy in
first official cross-country meet be
tween the two schools.
Stanford has Norman Bright and
Chuck Nimmo, transfer and sopho
more respectively, to carry the chief
burden of Indian duties in the long
grind. Bright, winner of the unoffi
cial distance race last year, has run
the two-mile in 9:43 and the one
mile in under 4:30, while Nimmo has
toured the four-lap jaunt in 4:29.
The latter's two-mile mark, how
ever, stamps him as the man to
beat Saturday. «
Golden Bear Entries
Leading light for the Bear har
riers is Dana Raymond, a two-miler
who came up with a rush at the
end of last track season to be the
best eight-lap ma/i Brutus Ham
ilton could produce. In the track
meet at Berkeley last Friday, Ray
mond broke ten minutes, the first
time a U.C. man has done it in some
years. Running 9:54, he more than
satisfied the hopes of both Coach
Hamilton and Brick Morse.
Finishing close to Raymond was
Bob Ral'tery, the hard-working Ber
keley boy, who had previously in
the afternoon run off with the mile
in 4:32, a neat accomplishment for
any man. Ral'tery is at his best in
three-lap races. The golf course is
nearer four miles, so he'll be at a
decided disadvantage.
Two More Runners
Pat Harrolcl and Bob Fowler, a
couple of sophomores with a cross
country legacy from Piedmont High
School, arc right in the money be
hind their more experienced rivals.
Both have long strides, which should
be helpful on the long course. Fow
ler came in behind Raftery in the
two-mile fiat race, and aided by the
rolling hills and the more extensive
mileage, should be abie to beat the
i husky redhead. Harrold, a made
over 440 man, was the second Cal
entrant to finish in the cross coun
try against U.C.L.A., but is not in
the best of shape at the moment.
Coaches Tempieton and Ellington
have four more fine two-milers in
Art Azevedo, 01 lie Amdahl, David
Devlin, and Jim Ferrie. Azevedo,
' with five or six years of high school
and college running behind him, is
always reliable in the longer tests.
Amdahl reached his peak in track
season two years ago and was one
of the Coast's best at that time, but
a leg injury last spring put him out
of competition. He has been work
ing out in the early afternoons this
quarter, and has reached top con
dition.
Revamped 881) Man
Devlin, revamped from the 880
last year, has acquired a nice "lean"
and possesses enough stamina and
endurance for the race. Ferrie, who
did the unusual by running the 880,
mile, and two-mile last Friday, will
renew his old rivalry with Raftery
and looks like he's in pretty fair
shape.
Three more Cal runners are Hen
ry Anderson, Woody Kitchell, and
track captain-elect Lyle Reynolds.
Anderson is reported as coming up
strong the past few weeks, and is
now running a pretty fast two-mile.
Kitchell, who turned in a 4:29 mile
last spring, finished second to Raf
tery in last week's mile, but is not
used to the four-mile trot. Captain
Reynolds rambled through his half
mile in 1:59, but, like Kitchell, is
no champion at the long trek.

the two-mile in 9:43 and the one
mile in under 4:30, while Nimmo has
toured the four-lap jaunt in 4:29.
The latter's two-mile mark, how
ever, stamps him as the man to
beat Saturday. «

Leading light for the Bear har
riers is Dana Raymond, a two-miler
who came up with a rush at the
end of last track season to be the
best eight-lap ma/i Brutus Ham
ilton could produce. In the track
meet at Berkeley last Friday, Ray
mond broke ten minutes, the first
time a U.C. man has done it in some
years. Running 9:54, he more than
satisfied the hopes of both Coach
Hamilton and Brick Morse.
Finishing close to Raymond was
Bob Ral'tery, the hard-working Ber
keley boy, who had previously in
the afternoon run off with the mile
in 4:32, a neat accomplishment for
any man. Ral'tery is at his best in
three-lap races. The golf course is
nearer four miles, so he'll be at a
decided disadvantage.
Two More Runners
Pat Harrolcl and Bob Fowler, a
couple of sophomores with a cross
country legacy from Piedmont High
School, arc right in the money be
hind their more experienced rivals.
Both have long strides, which should
be helpful on the long course. Fow
ler came in behind Raftery in the
two-mile fiat race, and aided by the
rolling hills and the more extensive
mileage, should be abie to beat the
i husky redhead. Harrold, a made
over 440 man, was the second Cal
entrant to finish in the cross coun
try against U.C.L.A., but is not in
the best of shape at the moment.
Coaches Tempieton and Ellington
have four more fine two-milers in
Art Azevedo, 01 lie Amdahl, David
Devlin, and Jim Ferrie. Azevedo,
' with five or six years of high school
and college running behind him, is
always reliable in the longer tests.
Amdahl reached his peak in track
season two years ago and was one
of the Coast's best at that time, but
a leg injury last spring put him out
of competition. He has been work
ing out in the early afternoons this
quarter, and has reached top con
dition.
Revamped 881) Man
Devlin, revamped from the 880
last year, has acquired a nice "lean"
and possesses enough stamina and
endurance for the race. Ferrie, who
did the unusual by running the 880,
mile, and two-mile last Friday, will
renew his old rivalry with Raftery
and looks like he's in pretty fair
shape.
Three more Cal runners are Hen
ry Anderson, Woody Kitchell, and
track captain-elect Lyle Reynolds.
Anderson is reported as coming up
strong the past few weeks, and is
now running a pretty fast two-mile.
Kitchell, who turned in a 4:29 mile
last spring, finished second to Raf
tery in last week's mile, but is not
used to the four-mile trot. Captain
Reynolds rambled through his half
mile in 1:59, but, like Kitchell, is
no champion at the long trek.
A genuine treat is in store fo.r
anyone and everyone who happens
to be in the country adjacent to
the Stanford golf course Saturday
morning when some of the best dis
tance men on the coast, representing
the Universities of Stanford and
California, meet to decide both in
dividual and team supremacy in
first official cross-country meet be
tween the two schools.
Stanford has Norman Bright and
Chuck Nimmo, transfer and sopho
more respectively, to carry the chief
burden of Indian duties in the long
grind. Bright, winner of the unoffi
cial distance race last year, has run
the two-mile in 9:43 and the one
mile in under 4:30, while Nimmo has
toured the four-lap jaunt in 4:29.
