# Chris Freeman, Logger, Did Strong Man Act
## 
### 
Back in 1927 one of Stanford's
toughest tackles, Chris Freeman,
went for a walk with a couple of
pals on a sunny afternoon. In good
humor and high spirits, they sat
down on a large log to rest, an ar
gument began.
It ended with Freeman betting he
could carry the log on his back
down to Encina. And this he did,
taking it up t othe fifth floor, leav
ing it in the corridor. Next morning
it took four husky frosh to lift and
carry the thing out.
Books valued at over $. r >o are kept
