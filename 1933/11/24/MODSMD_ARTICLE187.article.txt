On the left is Boh Hamilton, sophomore sensational right half; good at
blocking, running, and defensive play he promises to become one of the
Pacific Coast's greatest all-around hacks. Bill Sim, on the right, was
named a half on last year's all-Coast teams, and "Pop" Warner picked
him as one of his best men of all time. Sim lias been out of the running
due to injuries lately. (Associated Press Photo)
