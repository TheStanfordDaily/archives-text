# Outlook for Track Good
## 
### 
California will be stronger this
year. U.S.C. will be somewhat
weaker than in 1932. Stanford will
remain nearly constant.
That seems to be the present quo
tation on California's big three of
the cinder, path, with fall track and
field practice well under way.
That is not a hard and fast gen
eralization, since eprsonalities and
reputations form the only basis for J
the prediction at this early date.
Two Gridmen Expected
Coach Dink Tempieton is now
drilling nine letter men, and he will
add two more to his roll book when
football season is completed. Many :
members of the 1933 freshman squad
are working out daily, and several
of these give every indication of
becoming lettermen this year.
Led by Captain Gus Meier, rated
as the outstanding hurdler on the
Coast, the following lettermen have
checked out suits: Olaf Amdahl and
Art Azevedo, two-mile; Bud Dea
con, 14-foot pole vaulter; Al Black
man, quarter miler and javelin
thrower; Phil Williams, broad jump
er; Johnny Mottram, greatly im
proving javelin tosser; Lloyd
Schween, winner of the first Trojan >
meet last spring in the high jump, ;
and Johnny Lyman, University !
record holder in the shot put
Many Sophomores
Slinger Dunn, weight man, and
Paul Zaches, broad jumping veteran,
both are members of the Cardinal
gridiron squad.
Sophomore contenders will fill in
some of the questionable depart
ments and help to round out the
Indian squad. Chuck Nimmo, mile
sensation, and Sam Klopstock and
Hunt Kingsbury, hurdlers, show po
tentialities galore. Other second
year men are Don Albertson, high
jumper; Charles Jonas and Van
Ginn, pole vauliers, and Tom Hud
son and Gib Holloway, weight toss
ers.
The much - publicized Stanford
sophomore football team will con
tribute Claude Galloway, Bob Rey
nolds, and George Leedy at the close
of its s'chedule. All three are weight
men. Tempieton has hopes of en- |
couraging Bobby Grayson, Jim
"Monk" Moscrip, and Johnny Reis
ner, springing stars, to replace the
pigskin with spikes during the :
spring season.
Carlton Thorns leads the junior ,
college transfer contingent, and he i
already is counted on for several
victories in the dashes.
With a strong group of juniors 1
and several prominent sophomores
to fill in at much-needed events,
California will offer considerably
more opposition next year than in
past seasons.
Stanford's schedule will be made
out in December, and it will include
the Big Meet, probably the third
week in April, and dual meets with
U.S.C. and the Olympic Club.
