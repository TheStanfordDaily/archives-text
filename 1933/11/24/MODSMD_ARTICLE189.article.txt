# Fewer Stanford Rooters This Year Than in 1932
## 
### 
More rooter tickets were sold to
Stanford grid fans for the 1932 Big
Game in Berkeley than the 1933
classic tomorrow in the Indian sta
dium. Last year approximately 2,177
ducats were sold, tomorrow the sec
tion will be composed of about 2,000
enthusiasts.
Reason back of this seeming phe
nomenon is simply that close to 1,000
students are employed to control
traffic, handle seating arrangements
in the stadium, operate concession
booths, sell programs. More stu
dents will see the battle tomorrow
than did last year, but they won't
be in the rooting section.
