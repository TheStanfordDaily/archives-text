# THORNHILL CLIMBS FROM OBSCURITY
## All-American Named 'Tiny' After Clipping Official 
### Frank Tremaine 
As assistant to "Pop" Warner,
generally accepted as one of the
football master-minds of the times,
i "Tiny" Thornhill was just, another
j line coach and occupied that ob
scure position for 11 years at Stan
ford. Then he was suddenly ele
vated to fill the job of head coach
, and in his first year at the helm of
the Big Red Machine, Thornhill has
astonished grid critics the country
over with his success.
Perhaps Thornnill has never re
ceived the credit due him as a coach.
Before he came to Stanford: he
i coached the linemen at Centre Gol
| lege whefi the Praying Colonels
were the toast of football.
Charley Moran, the National
League umpire, was officially head
' coach at the Kentucky school at that
time but his baseball duties kept
him occupied during the early part
of the grid season and it was Thorn
hill who laid the foundation for the
great Centre teams and piloted them
through their early season games.
Although he never got much credit
for it, his success can be seen by the
great record established by the Col
onels during those years.
All-American "Tiny"
If he is just coming into his own
as a coach, "Tiny" never had much
trouble gaining recognition as a
player for he was selected as All—
j American tackle in from Pitts
! burg where he played under War
-1 ner on what is often called the
greatest team "Pop" ever put. out
and is considered one of the great
j teams of all time.
It was while he was playing at
Pitt that Thornhill picked up the
name of "Tiny" which has followed
| him so closely since that few people
| know he was christened Claude.
Earns Nickname
The Panthers were playing Syra
cuse at the time and Thornhill, at
tackle, often pulled out of the line
on offense to go after the opposing
fulback. "Tiny" Maxwell, a huge
man, was officiating the game and
always seemed to be in Thornhill's
way as he tried to block the full.
Thornhill finally warned Maxwell
