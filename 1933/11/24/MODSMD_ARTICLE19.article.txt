# THORNHILL CLIMBS FROM OBSCURITY
## All-American Named 'Tiny' After Clipping Official 
### Frank Tremaine 
As assistant to "Pop" Warner,
generally accepted as one of the
football master-minds of the times,
i "Tiny" Thornhill was just, another
j line coach and occupied that ob
scure position for 11 years at Stan
ford. Then he was suddenly ele
vated to fill the job of head coach
, and in his first year at the helm of
the Big Red Machine, Thornhill has
astonished grid critics the country
over with his success.
Perhaps Thornnill has never re
ceived the credit due him as a coach.
Before he came to Stanford: he
i coached the linemen at Centre Gol
| lege whefi the Praying Colonels
were the toast of football.
Charley Moran, the National
League umpire, was officially head
' coach at the Kentucky school at that
time but his baseball duties kept
him occupied during the early part
of the grid season and it was Thorn
hill who laid the foundation for the
great Centre teams and piloted them
through their early season games.
Although he never got much credit
for it, his success can be seen by the
great record established by the Col
onels during those years.
All-American "Tiny"
If he is just coming into his own
as a coach, "Tiny" never had much
trouble gaining recognition as a
player for he was selected as All—
j American tackle in from Pitts
! burg where he played under War
-1 ner on what is often called the
greatest team "Pop" ever put. out
and is considered one of the great
j teams of all time.
It was while he was playing at
Pitt that Thornhill picked up the
name of "Tiny" which has followed
| him so closely since that few people
| know he was christened Claude.
Earns Nickname
The Panthers were playing Syra
cuse at the time and Thornhill, at
tackle, often pulled out of the line
on offense to go after the opposing
fulback. "Tiny" Maxwell, a huge
man, was officiating the game and
always seemed to be in Thornhill's
way as he tried to block the full.
Thornhill finally warned Maxwell
<u..i it 1... .liJ-.'t „r k;..
he would clip him.
A few plays later there was Max
well in Thornhill's path so the giant
tackle upset the rel'eere in as beau
tiful a clip as any coach could ask
for. But Maxwell managed to fall
on Thornhill. "Get off me, you ele
phant," shouted the player. "You're
not so tiny yourself." The players
picked up the name and Thornhill
hasn't been able to shake it since.
High School Athlete
"Tiny" first made a name for him
self as an athlete in high school. Al
the age of 11 he was stricken with
paralysis of both legs after an at
tack of scarlet fever, and as he
| started to recover, doctors pre
scribed exercise. He took up base
ball, basketball, hockey, track, la
crosse, tennis, and football. And
when he moved to Beaver, Penn., he
became outstanding on the cinder
path, turning the 410 in 51 seconds
and the 880 in 2:02.
However, it was in football that
he made a name for himself as a
fullback and many colleges were
after him. Hube Wagner, Panther
captain, finally persuaded Thornhill
that Pittsburg was the place for
him, and although his parents said
he wasn't to play football, the next
year found "Tiny" at fullback on
the Pitt team coached by Joe Duff,
former Princeton Ail-American.
Plays for Warner
It was under Warner, who took
| over the reins at Pittsburg shortly
after, that "Tiny" gained his great
est fame as a player after shifting to
tackle. After his selection as an All-
American in 1916, he assisted War
ner the following season but quit in
the middle of the year to play pro
fessional football at, Massilon, Ohio.
He went from Massilon to Cleve
land as player-manager where he
played with Knute Rockne, and la
ter against him when the latter went
to Detroit. It was at this time that
he developed his "butterfly" defense
against the Rockne system which
was used by Stanford this year
against Santa Clara and in 1925
against the Ramblers in the Rose
Bowl.
Thornhill decided that since the
success of the Rockne offense de
pended in a great measure on the
end's ability to handle the defensive
tackle alone, he would play a couple
i of yards back of the line where the
end couldn't get at him and then
rush in to break up the play.
West to Stanford
After coaching at Centre the next
few years, Thornhill was offered
Warner's job at Pittsburg, but. he
elected to come west to Stanford as
co-coach with Andy Kerr in 1922 to
| break the ground for "Pop" when
the latter arrived in 1924. "Tiny"
: was considered for the position of
head coach here at that time, but
President Wilbur decided he was
too young so he divided the duties
I with Kerr.
As Warner's assistant at Stan
| ford, Thornhill never got much pub
! licity except when the Cardinal line
1 cracked to allow opposing teams to
I score. However, during his stay on
I the Coast he has been tendered the
head coaching jobs 'at Oregon and
i Washington.
Now in his first year with full
control, "Tiny" has electrified the
I nation with his success which was
climaxed with the defeat of U.S.C.
, two weeks ago, the first handed the
Trojans in 27 games.

fullback and many colleges were
after him. Hube Wagner, Panther
captain, finally persuaded Thornhill
that Pittsburg was the place for
him, and although his parents said
he wasn't to play football, the next
year found "Tiny" at fullback on
the Pitt team coached by Joe Duff,
former Princeton Ail-American.
Plays for Warner
It was under Warner, who took
| over the reins at Pittsburg shortly
after, that "Tiny" gained his great
est fame as a player after shifting to
tackle. After his selection as an All-
American in 1916, he assisted War
ner the following season but quit in
the middle of the year to play pro
fessional football at, Massilon, Ohio.
He went from Massilon to Cleve
land as player-manager where he
played with Knute Rockne, and la
ter against him when the latter went
to Detroit. It was at this time that
he developed his "butterfly" defense
against the Rockne system which
was used by Stanford this year
against Santa Clara and in 1925
against the Ramblers in the Rose
Bowl.
Thornhill decided that since the
success of the Rockne offense de
pended in a great measure on the
end's ability to handle the defensive
tackle alone, he would play a couple
i of yards back of the line where the
end couldn't get at him and then
rush in to break up the play.
West to Stanford
After coaching at Centre the next
few years, Thornhill was offered
Warner's job at Pittsburg, but. he
elected to come west to Stanford as
co-coach with Andy Kerr in 1922 to
| break the ground for "Pop" when
the latter arrived in 1924. "Tiny"
: was considered for the position of
head coach here at that time, but
President Wilbur decided he was
too young so he divided the duties
I with Kerr.
As Warner's assistant at Stan
| ford, Thornhill never got much pub
! licity except when the Cardinal line
1 cracked to allow opposing teams to
I score. However, during his stay on
I the Coast he has been tendered the
head coaching jobs 'at Oregon and
i Washington.
Now in his first year with full
control, "Tiny" has electrified the
I nation with his success which was
climaxed with the defeat of U.S.C.
, two weeks ago, the first handed the
Trojans in 27 games.
As assistant to "Pop" Warner,
generally accepted as one of the
football master-minds of the times,
i "Tiny" Thornhill was just, another
j line coach and occupied that ob
scure position for 11 years at Stan
ford. Then he was suddenly ele
vated to fill the job of head coach
, and in his first year at the helm of
the Big Red Machine, Thornhill has
astonished grid critics the country
over with his success.
Perhaps Thornnill has never re
ceived the credit due him as a coach.
Before he came to Stanford: he
i coached the linemen at Centre Gol
| lege whefi the Praying Colonels
were the toast of football.
Charley Moran, the National
League umpire, was officially head
' coach at the Kentucky school at that
time but his baseball duties kept
him occupied during the early part
of the grid season and it was Thorn
hill who laid the foundation for the
great Centre teams and piloted them
through their early season games.
Although he never got much credit
for it, his success can be seen by the
great record established by the Col
onels during those years.
All-American "Tiny"
If he is just coming into his own
as a coach, "Tiny" never had much
trouble gaining recognition as a
player for he was selected as All—
j American tackle in from Pitts
! burg where he played under War
-1 ner on what is often called the
greatest team "Pop" ever put. out
and is considered one of the great
j teams of all time.
It was while he was playing at
Pitt that Thornhill picked up the
name of "Tiny" which has followed
| him so closely since that few people
| know he was christened Claude.
Earns Nickname
The Panthers were playing Syra
cuse at the time and Thornhill, at
tackle, often pulled out of the line
on offense to go after the opposing
fulback. "Tiny" Maxwell, a huge
man, was officiating the game and
always seemed to be in Thornhill's
way as he tried to block the full.
Thornhill finally warned Maxwell
<u..i it 1... .liJ-.'t „r k;..
he would clip him.
A few plays later there was Max
well in Thornhill's path so the giant
tackle upset the rel'eere in as beau
tiful a clip as any coach could ask
for. But Maxwell managed to fall
on Thornhill. "Get off me, you ele
phant," shouted the player. "You're
not so tiny yourself." The players
picked up the name and Thornhill
hasn't been able to shake it since.
High School Athlete
"Tiny" first made a name for him
self as an athlete in high school. Al
the age of 11 he was stricken with
paralysis of both legs after an at
tack of scarlet fever, and as he
| started to recover, doctors pre
scribed exercise. He took up base
ball, basketball, hockey, track, la
crosse, tennis, and football. And
when he moved to Beaver, Penn., he
became outstanding on the cinder
path, turning the 410 in 51 seconds
and the 880 in 2:02.

great Centre teams and piloted them
through their early season games.
Although he never got much credit
for it, his success can be seen by the
great record established by the Col
onels during those years.
All-American "Tiny"
If he is just coming into his own
as a coach, "Tiny" never had much
trouble gaining recognition as a
player for he was selected as All—
j American tackle in from Pitts
! burg where he played under War
-1 ner on what is often called the
greatest team "Pop" ever put. out
and is considered one of the great
j teams of all time.
It was while he was playing at
Pitt that Thornhill picked up the
name of "Tiny" which has followed
| him so closely since that few people
| know he was christened Claude.
Earns Nickname
The Panthers were playing Syra
cuse at the time and Thornhill, at
tackle, often pulled out of the line
on offense to go after the opposing
fulback. "Tiny" Maxwell, a huge
man, was officiating the game and
always seemed to be in Thornhill's
way as he tried to block the full.
Thornhill finally warned Maxwell

As assistant to "Pop" Warner,
generally accepted as one of the
football master-minds of the times,
i "Tiny" Thornhill was just, another
j line coach and occupied that ob
scure position for 11 years at Stan
ford. Then he was suddenly ele
vated to fill the job of head coach
, and in his first year at the helm of
the Big Red Machine, Thornhill has
astonished grid critics the country
over with his success.
Perhaps Thornnill has never re
ceived the credit due him as a coach.
Before he came to Stanford: he

were the toast of football.
Charley Moran, the National
League umpire, was officially head
' coach at the Kentucky school at that
time but his baseball duties kept
him occupied during the early part
of the grid season and it was Thorn

<u..i it 1... .liJ-.'t „r k;..
he would clip him.
A few plays later there was Max
well in Thornhill's path so the giant
tackle upset the rel'eere in as beau
tiful a clip as any coach could ask
for. But Maxwell managed to fall
on Thornhill. "Get off me, you ele
phant," shouted the player. "You're
not so tiny yourself." The players
picked up the name and Thornhill
hasn't been able to shake it since.
High School Athlete
"Tiny" first made a name for him
self as an athlete in high school. Al
the age of 11 he was stricken with
paralysis of both legs after an at
tack of scarlet fever, and as he
| started to recover, doctors pre
scribed exercise. He took up base
ball, basketball, hockey, track, la
crosse, tennis, and football. And
when he moved to Beaver, Penn., he
became outstanding on the cinder
path, turning the 410 in 51 seconds
and the 880 in 2:02.
However, it was in football that
he made a name for himself as a
fullback and many colleges were
after him. Hube Wagner, Panther
captain, finally persuaded Thornhill
that Pittsburg was the place for
him, and although his parents said
he wasn't to play football, the next
year found "Tiny" at fullback on
the Pitt team coached by Joe Duff,
former Princeton Ail-American.
Plays for Warner
It was under Warner, who took
| over the reins at Pittsburg shortly
after, that "Tiny" gained his great
est fame as a player after shifting to
tackle. After his selection as an All-
American in 1916, he assisted War
ner the following season but quit in
the middle of the year to play pro
fessional football at, Massilon, Ohio.
He went from Massilon to Cleve
land as player-manager where he
played with Knute Rockne, and la
ter against him when the latter went
to Detroit. It was at this time that
he developed his "butterfly" defense
against the Rockne system which
was used by Stanford this year
against Santa Clara and in 1925
against the Ramblers in the Rose
Bowl.
Thornhill decided that since the
success of the Rockne offense de
pended in a great measure on the
end's ability to handle the defensive
tackle alone, he would play a couple
i of yards back of the line where the
end couldn't get at him and then
rush in to break up the play.
West to Stanford
After coaching at Centre the next
few years, Thornhill was offered
Warner's job at Pittsburg, but. he
elected to come west to Stanford as
co-coach with Andy Kerr in 1922 to
| break the ground for "Pop" when
the latter arrived in 1924. "Tiny"
: was considered for the position of
head coach here at that time, but
President Wilbur decided he was
too young so he divided the duties
I with Kerr.
As Warner's assistant at Stan
