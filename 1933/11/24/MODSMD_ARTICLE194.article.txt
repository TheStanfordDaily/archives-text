# RAMPANT HYSTERIA REIGNS AS DROFNATS SINGS SWAN SONG; ENCINA HARRY HELPS
## 
### 
Big Game excitement surging
through the Stanford campus today
finds Indian cohorts happy, confi
dent of victory.
Because of Stanford's sending
the Trojan horse to pasture, odds
stood 10-8 in their favor, and
Farm game pickers unanimously
chose Stanford to win.
At California, Brick Morse, evad
ing a treasurer who wanted him to
! pay his freshman class dues, went
into hibernation, mumbled some
thing about this year's track team,
a strong line, a weak backfield.
Templeton Aids Morale
j Dink Templeton, who startled the
world two weeks ago by seriously
announcing Stanford would take
Troy, gave an official air to Stan
ford confidence, predicted a win by
I 16-6. Two touchdowns, one con
, version, one field goal, will be Stan
ford's means of scoring, thinks Dink.
J. Sylvestre Pantsdown Drofnats,
1 puts on his flowing robes, takes out
the crystal ball on a short pass from
center and throws an elevator pass,
which entitles him to free rides at
! the Mark on Big Game night. His
, foresight and vision somewhat im
' paired due to the fact that he has
been standing on his head in a
wastebasket ever since he predicted
U.C.L.A. to take Washington, Drof
nats with force and a grape nuts
| nerve crucifiies himself in his last
1 prediction of the year to say he has

figured out the score on the under- j
side of the one table in Fiditch's
German Bee Garden (new location)
and adding up crossways and up
side-down it is a cinch that Stanford
will take California 20-14. With
tears in his eyes, Drofnats throws t
away his onion, gasps, "I know it's (
crazy, but I love it."
Harry to the Rescue i
Not to be outdone by any conser
vative speculation, Harry, Encina's
great janitor, pops through with a
prediction that Stanford will prob- '
ably win by about 50-0. '
Encina's Chef Dobbins, after sue- i
cessful years of Big Game picking, I
I pauses to state he feels sorry for ]
California, that they are very fine i
boys and they try hard, but that i
they won't have enough to stop
Stanford from winning 26-0. Chef'
Dobbins predicts a win by two hits, j
Stanford will hit California and Cal
ifornia will hit the ground, cracks
Chef Dobbins.
A general feeling of other Farm
enthusiasts favors Stanford. Most
are not as positive as Drofnate and
Harry. A fear of California's great 1
line, and the results of California's
underbear psychology keep over-!
j confidence from gaining headway. j
Frosty Peters drop-kickcd 17 field
goals in one game. He was playing
for the Montana freshmen against
Billings Poly in 1924. '
