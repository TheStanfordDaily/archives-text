# Damning Finger
## 
### 
More damning evidence piled up i
against confessed kidnap-murderers j
of Brooke Hart as a story-book style i
post - mortem indictment assailed |
them.
Searchers yesterday found bar- j
nacles clawed from one of the pilings |
under the San Mateo bridge—where'
Hart, for over an hour, waged a |
losing battle of youth against a kil- j
ler's bullets. • \
Meanwhile, San Jose vigilantes j'
grow restless, morose as crowds of
several hundreds move ceaselessly '•
before jail where Thurmond and ,
Holmes are kept. Action, as in days
of Murietta, may yet be forthcom- j
ing.
