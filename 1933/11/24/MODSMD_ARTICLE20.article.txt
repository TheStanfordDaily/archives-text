## Stunts, Yells Must Be Timed To Be Successful 
### Frank Orr 
"Rooters' stunts and yells, to be
effective, must bo timed together
and instructions followed closely,"
said Rally Committee Chairman
Stan Beaubaire in giving final in
structions to rooters at tomorrow's
game.
Men. in the rooting section must
have rooters' caps, which may be
purchased at Wideman's in Palo
Alto for 65 cents, and women must
carry pom-poms, on sale at the
A.S.S.U. office for 25 ccnts. Only a
few pom-poms are left at this spe
cial price.
Women in White
Women must wear white dresses
of coats and men white shirts if
stunts are to be effective and the
section is to look uniform.
The game is scheduled to start at
2 o'clock, but because the Stan
ford rooting section •.-> on the east or
far side of the stadium and because
there will be great numbers of auto
mobiles and spectators, rooters are
asked to be there by 1 o'clock so
that a hat stunt can be arranged.
"First come, first served" is the rule
for seating in the section. Band men
and members of the Glee Club will
sit in reserved sections at the bot
tom.
Songs to Be Used
Instructions of the Rally Commit
tee should be followed closely. They
are there to insure uniformity in
seating and to arrange stunts. The
following songs will be used and
should be learned by everyone:
"Come, Join the Band," "Sons of the
Stanford Red.'' "Back to Ihe Farm,"
and the Hymn.
Instructions for yells are as fol
lows:
1. Know the yells thoroughly.
2. All start on the first syllable,
and watch the yell leaders.
3. Keep together, snap it out at
the correct time by following the
motions, and force the syllables out
—don't drag them.
4. Save your voice by pitching it
up and forcing the sound against
your teeth.
5. Please allow the well leader to
do the talking. There's plenty of
time to yell, so save your breath.
(i. Don't boo, or shout cat calls at
ANYBODY.
