Women in White

of coats and men white shirts if
stunts are to be effective and the
section is to look uniform.
The game is scheduled to start at
2 o'clock, but because the Stan

asked to be there by 1 o'clock so
that a hat stunt can be arranged.
"First come, first served" is the rule
for seating in the section. Band men

Stanford Red.'' "Back to Ihe Farm,"
and the Hymn.
Instructions for yells are as fol
lows:
1. Know the yells thoroughly.
2. All start on the first syllable,
and watch the yell leaders.
3. Keep together, snap it out at
the correct time by following the
motions, and force the syllables out
—don't drag them.
4. Save your voice by pitching it
up and forcing the sound against
your teeth.
5. Please allow the well leader to
do the talking. There's plenty of
time to yell, so save your breath.
(i. Don't boo, or shout cat calls at
ANYBODY.
7. Sit well lined up in straight
! raws, The effect is much better.
8. If you want anything, ask the
man in the Red Cap.
Final Instruction
Don't argue with the Rally Com
mittee. They are at the game to
i help you, not to act as a debating
i squad.
!>. KNOW THE HYMN! It will
be sung after the game, and every
i rooter is expected to stay in his
i place until alter the Hymn has
| been sung.

2. All start on the first syllable,
and watch the yell leaders.
3. Keep together, snap it out at
the correct time by following the
motions, and force the syllables out
