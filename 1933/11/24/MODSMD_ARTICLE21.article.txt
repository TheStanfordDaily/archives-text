# BEARS, STANFORD PLAY 39th BIG GAME
## SPEEDY BACKS TO CHALLENGE POWERFUL LINE Thornhill's First Big Game Squad Enters Tilt On Long End of Odds 
### Spud Hamilton 
If not the "Bailie of the Century"
it looks at least like the battle of a
decade when the heavy, hardhoiled
Golden Bear and the heavy light
ning fast Stanford Indian meet in
Stanford Stadium tomorrow. At 2
o'clock the kick-off occurs and a
terrific struggle will begin, unless
the dope proves to be very dopey.
It will be the 39th k meeting of the
two teams.
I('s whiplash-voiced Bill In
gram against genial and jovial
"Tiny" Thornhill tomorrow. It's
power versus speed; it's a burly
enraged Golden Bear at bay
against a cool and determined In
dian. It's the shift against War
ner football stripped of its ornate
decorations. It's secret practice
against wide open, strangers wel
come practicc.
Best Kickers
Coach Thornhill is laying every
thing on the table. He will start his
familiar team of sophomores and
new men—the same team that
started against the Trojan herd. He
will seek to break his tremendous
speedy backs loose around the ends,
or inside the ends, or slap bang
through the middle. He has good
passers and good pass receivers; he
has the best kicking team on the
Pacific Coast. He has a young line,
green, but stubborn on defense.
California has a team that has its
moments, as they had them against
U.S.C. and Washington and St.
Mary's. They also have some weak
days—the days they had against
Washington State and Santa Clara.
Most of all California has the
Golden Bear fight; depend on Bill
Ingram to send eleven men out to
start the game that are men, full of:
fight and ready to go. But more than
that they have a tricky, shifting of
fense, the most baffling attack since
Ingram h&s been in the coach's
berth at Berkeley.
Both teams will be battling fort
shot at the Rose Bowl; both have
played the Pasadena game three;
times and have each won, lost, and
tied once.

Stanford opens with the same
line-up that went against U.S.C.;
California opens with the same line
up that they sent against U.S.C., ex
cept for Williams at left half, and he
went into the game after two min
utes and played the whole after
noon.
The odds have been quoted as 10
to 8 in Stanford's favor, but any
man who \\«>uld give odds on a Bit;
Game is just "plumb utterly fool
ish."
Goal Uncrossed
Since Ingram has been coaching
California, no man has crossed the
Bear goal line, and only one man,
Hankus Schaldach, has crossed the
Stanford goal line. Maybe the jinx
that favois new coaches will give
Thornhill a break tomorrow and
present him with a victory. "Pop"
Warner in his first year at Stanford
stopped a parade of California vic
tories with the famous 20-20 tie of
]<)24.
Bill Ingram in 1031 ended a seven
ye ir Stanford reign of undefeated
t' ams with a G-0 California win.

It will be the 39th k meeting of the
two teams.
I('s whiplash-voiced Bill In
gram against genial and jovial
"Tiny" Thornhill tomorrow. It's
power versus speed; it's a burly
enraged Golden Bear at bay
against a cool and determined In
dian. It's the shift against War
ner football stripped of its ornate
decorations. It's secret practice
against wide open, strangers wel
come practicc.
Best Kickers
Coach Thornhill is laying every
thing on the table. He will start his
familiar team of sophomores and
new men—the same team that
started against the Trojan herd. He
will seek to break his tremendous
speedy backs loose around the ends,
or inside the ends, or slap bang
through the middle. He has good
passers and good pass receivers; he
has the best kicking team on the
Pacific Coast. He has a young line,
green, but stubborn on defense.
California has a team that has its
moments, as they had them against
U.S.C. and Washington and St.
Mary's. They also have some weak
days—the days they had against
Washington State and Santa Clara.
Most of all California has the
Golden Bear fight; depend on Bill
Ingram to send eleven men out to
start the game that are men, full of:
fight and ready to go. But more than
that they have a tricky, shifting of
fense, the most baffling attack since
Ingram h&s been in the coach's
berth at Berkeley.
Both teams will be battling fort
shot at the Rose Bowl; both have
played the Pasadena game three;
times and have each won, lost, and
tied once.

Stanford opens with the same
line-up that went against U.S.C.;
California opens with the same line
up that they sent against U.S.C., ex
cept for Williams at left half, and he
went into the game after two min
utes and played the whole after
noon.
The odds have been quoted as 10
to 8 in Stanford's favor, but any
man who \\«>uld give odds on a Bit;
Game is just "plumb utterly fool
ish."
Goal Uncrossed
Since Ingram has been coaching
California, no man has crossed the
Bear goal line, and only one man,
Hankus Schaldach, has crossed the
Stanford goal line. Maybe the jinx
that favois new coaches will give
Thornhill a break tomorrow and
present him with a victory. "Pop"
Warner in his first year at Stanford
stopped a parade of California vic
tories with the famous 20-20 tie of
]<)24.
Bill Ingram in 1031 ended a seven
ye ir Stanford reign of undefeated
t' ams with a G-0 California win.
If not the "Bailie of the Century"
it looks at least like the battle of a
decade when the heavy, hardhoiled
Golden Bear and the heavy light
ning fast Stanford Indian meet in
Stanford Stadium tomorrow. At 2
o'clock the kick-off occurs and a
terrific struggle will begin, unless
the dope proves to be very dopey.
