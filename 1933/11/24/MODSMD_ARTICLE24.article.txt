## What a Game, People, What a Game! 
### 
Scientifically, there is absolutely no reason to get ex
cited. Two universities, namely: Stanford and California,
located on opposite sides of the San Francisco Bay, will
meet in a football encounter. They have met thirty-eight
times before. There is decidedly no cause for alarm for
they will meet for the thirty-ninth time tomorrow. And
barring that promised technocrat collapse, now some
months overdue, they will meet thirty-eight times again.
That is the whole story- obviously.
The experts have analyzed the game from all possible
angles. They have not only told us the score but who will
score, how they will score, why they will score, and the
quantity of water to be consumed by each player. It seems
a waste of effort to go on with the game. Why not fill the
stadium with the experts, let them fight it out, and the
winner who emerges can tell us exactly what would have
happened had Stanford played California. That would
save wear and tear on the footballs at least; and what with
the Roosevelt-AAA plan for birth control for pigs, that
would be no small saving.
After all, the Big Came is most similar to other football
games. There will undoubtedly be 22 contestants, 1 foot
ball. 1 officials, and 2 stray dogs. Of course each side will
have a coach who sits on the bench and does the worry
ing for the players, also smokiin up the cigarettes that
training rules have denied them all year.
If this is all true, why all this fuss and excitement?
Why will <SB.OOO people jam the Farm, jam the stadium,
jam San Francisco (in that order) raise what is loosely
termed hell in all three places? Simply because all the
above is coldly intellectual. And Big Came is more than
that.
There is that nebulous thing termed spirit. What is it?
Pleasant memories, much noise, accompanied by rising
of the blood pressure, would say the psychologist if you
could confine him to that few words.
But regardless of cause, or even consequence (a Mon
day morning headache), spirit is a grand sensation. It is
not logical but the illogical things are sometimes the best.
Kvervone will be straining the vocal chords beyond the
point decreed safe. Kvervone will forget everything for
two and one-half hours. Cold can go up or go down as it
pleases. Cermany can arm or disarm as they choose. In
tlation can come or go. The big thing is what effect will
it have on advancing the ball along the green grass.
The Big Came comes only once a year!

That is the whole story- obviously.
The experts have analyzed the game from all possible
angles. They have not only told us the score but who will
score, how they will score, why they will score, and the
quantity of water to be consumed by each player. It seems
a waste of effort to go on with the game. Why not fill the
stadium with the experts, let them fight it out, and the
winner who emerges can tell us exactly what would have
happened had Stanford played California. That would
save wear and tear on the footballs at least; and what with
the Roosevelt-AAA plan for birth control for pigs, that
would be no small saving.
After all, the Big Came is most similar to other football
games. There will undoubtedly be 22 contestants, 1 foot
ball. 1 officials, and 2 stray dogs. Of course each side will
have a coach who sits on the bench and does the worry
ing for the players, also smokiin up the cigarettes that
training rules have denied them all year.
If this is all true, why all this fuss and excitement?
Why will <SB.OOO people jam the Farm, jam the stadium,
jam San Francisco (in that order) raise what is loosely
termed hell in all three places? Simply because all the
above is coldly intellectual. And Big Came is more than
that.
There is that nebulous thing termed spirit. What is it?
Pleasant memories, much noise, accompanied by rising
of the blood pressure, would say the psychologist if you
could confine him to that few words.
But regardless of cause, or even consequence (a Mon
day morning headache), spirit is a grand sensation. It is
not logical but the illogical things are sometimes the best.
Kvervone will be straining the vocal chords beyond the
point decreed safe. Kvervone will forget everything for
two and one-half hours. Cold can go up or go down as it
pleases. Cermany can arm or disarm as they choose. In
tlation can come or go. The big thing is what effect will
it have on advancing the ball along the green grass.
The Big Came comes only once a year!
Scientifically, there is absolutely no reason to get ex
cited. Two universities, namely: Stanford and California,
located on opposite sides of the San Francisco Bay, will
meet in a football encounter. They have met thirty-eight
times before. There is decidedly no cause for alarm for
they will meet for the thirty-ninth time tomorrow. And
barring that promised technocrat collapse, now some
months overdue, they will meet thirty-eight times again.
