# STANFORD CONCERT LED BRILLIANTLY BY W. A. FUHRMANN
## 
### 
Under the baton of William A.
Fuhrmann, the Stanford Symphony
Orchestra gave its first concert of
(he year in the Palo Alto Community
Theatre with admirable .skill in spite |
of immaturity and new leadership.
A sparse audience acclaimed the or
chestra's rendition of Wagner's
"Overture to Rienzi," which was fol
lowed by Boccherini's "Minuet,"
played with delicacy and charm.
"Serenade Venitienne," Fuhr
mann's first composition, lilting, mel
odic, is based on an old Italian air.
"Je Veux Vivre Dans le Reve" from
Gounod's "Romeo and Juliet" was 1
the next nnmber on the program.
The guest artist was Emily Hardy,
San Francisco Opera soloist, whose
singing of the aria was entirely sym
pathetic with the sentimental nature
of the opera from which it was
taken. She graciously granted the
enthusiastic audience an encore,
"Song of the Nightingale," by Saint-
Saens.
The climax of the program was a
powerful interpretation of Bee- ;
thoven's "Fifth Symphony," despite
slight flaws in the wind instruments,
creating a symphonic lag. as it were.
Stanfordians and Palo Altans look
forward with great interest to more I
concerts of this group of talented
musicians.
