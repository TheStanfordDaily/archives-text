## 
### M. Jack Newman 
Twenty-two years or active par- I
ticipation in football both as a play- J
cr and a coach will be held by Bill j
Ingram, head coach at the Univer- ;
sity ol' California, when he leads lii& j
Bears into battle against the Stan- j
ford Indians tomorrow.
Just "Navy Bill"
Known throughout the sports j
world as a player and a coach extra- |
ordinary, "Navy Bill" started his j
football as halfback on the Jeffer
son, Indiana, high school team in
1811. After playing another year of
high school ball on the Indiana team
Ingram went to Louisville, Kentuc- j
ky, Men's High School where ho j
played a halfback position on the |
football team and dabbled in base- j
ball and basketball.
Appointed to the U.S. Naval j
Academy on his graduation from j
high school, Ingram went to An- I
napolis with the tradition of the |
family name to carry on.
During his undergraduate years at j
the Academy, Ingram won national j
fame as a halfback and quarter
back. He was captain of the team i
in his senior year and was chosen j
by Walter Camp as his second string, |
halfback in the All-American selec- i
tions of that year.
Versatile Athlete
Football did not take up all the I
leisure time of Ingram's Navy life. I
In between football seasons he j
played lacrosse, and stroked the j
Navy crew. During the years 1917 I
and '18 he rowed stroke position in j
every Navy race.
Through the years from 1919 to '
1921, he did active work in the i
Navy. He was recalled to the acad- ;
emy once to leach, acting as assist- !
ant coach to Gil Dobio. In 1921 he j
organized and played on a Pacific
Coast Fleet team. He resigned from I
the Navy in March 1922 to enter
business.
Coach in 192.'}
His coaching started in 1923 when '
he accepted a position at William !
and Mary. While there he received i
an offer to take charge of the In- |
diana Hoosiers.
In 1926 Ingram left Indiana to re- j
turn to the Naval Academy, this '
time as head coach. He stayed there j
until 1930. During this time teams
shone brilliantly among all compe
tition. In his first year the Navy
team was awarded the mythical na
tional championship.
Lost Few Games
While at the Navy helm, Ingram I
lost only eight games—four to Notre j
Dame, two to the Army, and one ;
each to Pennsylvania and Michigan. 5
At California since 1931, Ingram i
boasts of never having lost a Big ■
Game though his record has been j
much smirched otherwise. A strict '
disciplinarian and unyielding coach, J
Ingram drives his teams into obe- j
dience if he cannot secure what he 1
wants otherwise. Witness: his j
walking out on the team during pre-
Washington game practice tnd the i
results he secured.
