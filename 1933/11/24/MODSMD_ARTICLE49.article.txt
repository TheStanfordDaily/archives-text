During the P.A.L. water polo title |
game yesterday afternoon in the En- ,
cina pools, a middle-aged woman
came in to view the proceedings. !
Quietly escorted by a man of like !
age, she managed to reach the sev- | ;
enth row of the bleachers and sit :
for some time unnoticed.
Suddenly an unclad spectator i
standing near the diving tower spied :
her, bawled out "Hey, Nort (referee i
Thornton), there's a woman in the
place," and pointed anxiously to the ;
spot, while he and one other chap
formed a column behind a boy who i
had on swimming trunks to hide
themselves.
The game was stopped for two j
minutes, Thornton told the woman, |j
"These games are not open to la- j
dies," bewildered nudes scattered, i
jumping into the water, and the ,
flushed spectator left as quietly as
she had come. i
