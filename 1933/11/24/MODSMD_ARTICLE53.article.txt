# STANFORD RIDERS FACE SAN MATEO POLO CLUB TODAY
## 
### Chuck Chappell 
With one eye cocked in the direc
tion of next week's University of |
Arizona trip, Stanford's poloists will I
meet a team from the San Mateo
Polo Club thi* afternoon in a game
that promises to he one of the best ,
of the year. The contest will begin |
at 3 o'clock on the Highway field. j
Calling themselves the Castro
Valley team, the San Mateans
carry a 12 - goal handicap that
stamps them as tlie classiest quar
tet that the Indians have met or
will meet this season.
Experienced, polished, and beauti- j
fully . mounted, the visitors are j
expected to give Captain Gordan s |
mallct-wielders their first real test
of ihe season.
Four-goal Hating
Though not officially rated, Stan
ford will probably carry a four-goal j
handicap. Whether the Indians will 1
take advantage of the handicap dis
parity or play the game on even \
terms has not been decided yet.
Playing on an even basis would
mean pretty certain defeat for Stan- j
ford unless the Redshirts play an i
inspired brand of polo. A good still
workout in preparation for the Ari
zona series is what Captain Gordan
wants, however.
Stanford Line-up
Starting for Stanford will be the
experienced combination of Captain
Luppc Luppen at number one, j
Kemp Maer at two, Woody Melone
at three, and Bill Rogers at back, i
Maer has been staging a spirited !
battle with Frank Burns for the
number two position but finally
seems to have gained the edge over
his rival.
Though handicapped by the loss !
of two of their best ponies, the Stan- j
ford riders are capable of giving the
visitors a busy afternoon of it. With
more than 30 experienced men turn
ing out at the beginning of the sea
son, Captain Gordan expects to de- 1
vclop a team that will surpass last
year's strong quartet.
Luppen and Melone were both ;
regulars on last year's team, al- 1
though the latter will graduate at
the end of autumn quarter. Maer, 1
although a substitute last year, saw j
plenty of action, while Bill Rogers i
is a horseman and poloist of con
siderable experience.
Good Second String
A second team that Gordan rates
as practically on a par with his
first string includes Harold Ander
son at one, Frank Burns at two,
Russell Rasmussen at three, and Bob
Fullerton at back. Ineligible until
next year because of the freshman
rule, Rasmussen and Fuller, Culver
graduates, are two of the best pros
pects to enter Stanford in some time.
Next Tuesday the Stanford riders :
will leave for their Thanksgiving se- 1
lies with the University of Arizona
at Tucson. With the Wildcats con
sistently turning out one of the out- â€¢
standing collegiate polo teams of the
nation, this semi - annual set of
games is rapidly becoming one of
the classics of Western polo.
