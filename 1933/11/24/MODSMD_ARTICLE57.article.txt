# "POP" WARNER AT NEW POST IN EAST; LOSES BUT TWO GAMES SO FAR THIS YEAR
## 
### 
"Pop" Warner, new coach at Tem
i pie University, has turned out a
{well rounded, colorful team in
j first year at the sprouting Pennsyl
j vania institution. He has lost two
games, one to Bucknell, 20-7, and
i one to Carnegie Tech, 23-0.
Mystery Plays
For the most part, the Warner re
l verses and retreating quarterback
plays are mystifying the Eastern
S teams. Temple opened the season
with South Carolina, which fell 26-f>.
| and was then dumped by Carnegie's
I Skibos, whose spectacular passing
'game was developed by the youth
; ful Howard Harpster.
Temple returned to the winning
columns next week by defeating
I Haskell Indians, Warner's old team,
31-0.
West Virginia fell next before the
i Warner reverses by a 13 to 7 score,
j and then the Temple Owls oxperi-
I meed their second defeat, 20-7, by
j Bucknell. The following week Tcm
i pie downed Drake and then was
impressive in winning from Wash
ington and Jefferson, 13-0.
Tomorrow, Temple will be battling
i Villanova, their traditional rivals.

Last year Villanova won 7-0. It will
he Warner's second experience with
Harry Stuldreher, the Villanova
coach, who played on the Notre
Dame team of 1924 that boat Stan
ford 27-10 in one of the greatest of
Rose Bowl battles.
Stuldreher was quarterback and
,i member of the legendary Four
Horsemen that included Miller, Lay
den, and Crowley.
