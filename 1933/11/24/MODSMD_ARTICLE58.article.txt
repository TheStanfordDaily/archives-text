forded the scoring opportunity.
The teams were evenly matched
in offensive and defensive play, both
losing the ball on downs, both utiliz
ing well-executed lateral and run
ning plays.

occasions Howe kicked to the Se
quoia 5-yard line and Ladue booted j
back to safety Many passes were
intercepted by both teams, Ladue i
making the only good return.

ute left to play in the first half when j
John Slusser passed 30 yards to
Ward Vincent v/ho ran 40 yards
where he was overtaken on the 9-
yard line by Ladue. The half ended
With the futile attempt of Bill Hoelle
to kick a field goal.
