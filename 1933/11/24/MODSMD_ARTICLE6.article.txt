# Disarmament
## 
### 
II Duce and the Italian govern
ment remained incontrovertably op
timistic as disarmament continued
its toboggan along with the dollar.
An official communique "is hopeful
for collaborat ion between big pow
ers to produce world disarmament
agreement."
Simultaneously, even as stewing
committee of the practically buried
confab "adjourned" until mid-Jan
uary, a frantic secretary of a wob
bly League of Nations worked fever
ishly to forestall Italy's threatened
withdrawal.
