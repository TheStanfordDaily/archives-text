# CARD SOCCERMEN OUT TO BEAT CAL AFTER TWO WINS
## 
### Joe Lanidrac 
Victories in both the first two
games of the annual three - game
j soccer series against the University : |
, of California gives the Stanford var- i 1
! sity a 1.000 series standing to de
j fend when it faces the Blue and
; Gold's vengeful eleven booters to- ,
j morrow morning.
Having missed a complete triplc
| victory series against the Bears last
| year only by a 0 to 0 tie in the
j second game, the Redmen have an
! opportunity to repeat their 1931 per
! formance of three consecutive wins
j by taking this last 1933 season con
| test. Two veterans of the team of
! three years ago, Captain Carl
Knecht and Art Hearn, both for
; wards of note, lead the present Car
j dinal soccermen into the fray from
i which they hope to emerge with the
! third California defeat.
Four Subs Start
That team which, absolutely un
substituted in the second soccer Big
i Game of a week ago, humiliated the j
j Bears twice will not start intact. |
| Four first-string subs will replace I
that number of the original Bear- j
! baiting group in an attempt to try
i a new combination which Coach
Harry Maloney believes may have
! even more strength and scoring
! power than another combine.
In the halfback line two of these
players will line up, one on each
side of the veteran center half. John
Moore. At left half the classical ball
; and body smasher, Johnny Hitch
! cock, will take Waddy White's posi
| tion. While at right half, taking
| over the berth owned in the past
! games by Rudy Gonzales, Dave
; Dunning will take the responsibility.
Bud Krebs will displace Sven Dod
i dington at right wyig in the Cardi
| nal offense and Rod Lewis will take
Dick Strouse's left fullback post to
j team up with the recently developed
i defense star, Cy Johnson.
Old Guard to Finish
If the new combination does not j
j click by the end of the first half, j
I or if it has run up a fine lead even, i
! Maloney will probably throw back j
j the old guard to finish their last J
game of the season.
For nine of the starting line-up
! the Cal battle will be their last game i
, playing for Stanford. Only two of j
that initial organization will be back !
next year, these being the two stel
i lar inside forwards, Doug Kennedy
! and Mike Gomez, unless it is pos-
J sible that the valuable Cy Johnson
j may return next autumn quarter
for a last-quarter season. Kennedy
and Gomez are bright spots of the
Stanford offense and have shown up
I well against Cal, Gomez having two
j tallies and Kennedy one tally on
| their respective lists.
Chico Marx once held the job of
- combination wrestler and pianist.
