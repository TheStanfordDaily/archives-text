The accurate, place-kicking toe of
Bill Cor bus may very easily be the
deciding feature of tomorrow's clash, j
if Harlow Rotherl':; predictions come '
t rue.
Rothert, former varsity halfback ;
and present executive alumni sec- j
retary, has been watching "Tiny's"
men closely this year, and in an in
terview yesterday gave his views on I
the outcome of tlie game.
"The possibility of the Bears not
scoring appears lo be good," he j
said, "since their offense has not
lit en outstanding so far this year.
On the other hand, their line, con
sidered stronger than S.C.'s, may
prove a lough barrier for Indian
backs to break down. If it proves
unsurmounfable, it may be up to j
Corbus to save the day.
"The fast, hard charge of the Cali- |
fornia line should not bother our j
players, inasmuch as Thornhill's j
plays are designed to lake advantage |
of just such a defense.
"With their enviable record in the i
.passing department made in the S.C.
game, to keep up, the team has spent
much time during these last few
weeks perfecting their aerial attack,"
said Rotherl, "and it should, from
present indications, prove very ef- |
fective tomorrow.
"This year'.; Big Game will be
even closer, and harder fought than
current opinion seems to indicate,"
he said, "although the superior speed i
;'iid all-around ability of Stanford I
backs should provide enough mar- ;
gin for an Indian win.
Good Condition
"From what 1 have been able to '
gather from personal contact with I
the men," lie concluded, "members
of the team are in better condition, |
physically and mentally, than ever i
before. With the Conference cham- )
pion.-hip at stake, and the very good i
prospect of the Rose Bowl game in j
sight, I am confident that tomorrow I
afternoon will find Stanford on the j
long end of the score."
