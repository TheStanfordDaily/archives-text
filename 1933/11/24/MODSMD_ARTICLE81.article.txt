## GOLDEN BEARS HAD FUN WITH THE REFEREES 
### 
There was outburst of injured in
nocence in the camp of the Golden
Bear a short while ago, when Cali
fornia went to Los Angeles and
foundered in a scoreless tie with the
kid brother, U.C.L.A. It seems that
those awful Southern California ref
erees had caught the Bear backs
busting in and out of their shift with
two much speed, and, consequently,
they slapped a couple of penalties
on the bears.
Now, anyone who has seen the
Cal team in action this year, or at
least seen the California-U.S.C.
game at Berkeley, would be very
much surprised that Ingram and the
California team should resent being
called for an occassional penalty, es
pecially since they insist on tread
ing the narrow edge of the rule
book in the matter of stopping one
full second between the end of the
shift and the start of the play.
