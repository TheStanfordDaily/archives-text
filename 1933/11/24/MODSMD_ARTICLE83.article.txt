# JONES DIDN'T COMPLAIN; LIKES THE SHIFT, WILL KEEP IT
## 
### 
Of course, Howard Jones neither
! said or intimated that anything was
wrong with the officiating. In the
first place, Jones is a complete
sportsman; in the second, he is foot
ball's greatest expounder of the
shift, and he will utter nothing that
might be construed as derogatory
to it.
Referee Tom Louttit worked a
competently called game at Los An
geles in the Trojan-Stanford game; |
we hope he does as well tomorrow.
If the rules call for a one second
halt, let California halt, and let Ref
eree Louttit call them if the Golden
Bear fudges.
