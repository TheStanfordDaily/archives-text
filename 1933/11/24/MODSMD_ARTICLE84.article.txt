# TOMORROW IS DAY OF "BIG GAME" EVERYWHERE
## 
### 
More teams than Stanford and
California will be fighting their big
game tomorrow. The much brow
beaten Notre Dame will be clashing
with U.S.C. and it looks all Trojan
ihis year, although there is always
•.he upset possibility.
Yale and Harvard engage in their .
.;nnual dog-fight, and it really looks
like a dog-fight this year with both
teams well matched.
Army and Navy resume their an- ,
nual tussle; it looks like Army
again. —Hamilton
