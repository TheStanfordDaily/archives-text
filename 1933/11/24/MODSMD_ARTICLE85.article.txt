## 
### GRAY CREVELING 
Water polo's Big Game, Tuesday l
j at Berkeley, promises to be the de
i ciding factor as to the title winner j
! of the Northern California Water
1 Polo League title.
I Stanford has gone through its au
i tumn round of contests undefeated.
< In the first game, the Cards nosed
' out the Athens Club, who were at
j that time the favorites to win the
| league. Score: 7-G. Fast improving
i varsity water poloists downed league
i weak - sister Lakeside Swimming
I Club in the following tussle 7-2,
I showing better team work and
shooting with better aim than that
with which they managed to beat
Athens.
Beat Olympians
I The last game to date was the
| most convincing victory for Nort
; Thornton's proteges. Highly touted
j Olympic Club water polomen fell
'11-5. In this game Jimmy Triolo
rang up six goals in the first half
| to account tor two-thirds of the nine
! goals that Stanford got through.
The clubmen didn't score once in
the first period, but came back de
termined in the second to ring up
! five outplaying the Indians who
scored only two more.
The Golden Bears are stil unde
| feated, but they face the Olympic
Club tonight, and may taste defeat
at the hands of favored San Fran
t ciscans.
Fast-Breaking Team
Most characteristic feature of tlie
| Stanford swimmers is the way in
which they handle the ball and baf
fle opposition with fast - breaking
plays.
I Thornton's plays on offense are
criss-crosses, forwards to right or
â– 

left, and some unconventional trick I
move:-, of his own. Opposing coaches
laud his teams wherever they go,
but especially commend his plays.
Thornton Enthusiastic
Coach Thornton was never so en
thused this year as he was after ;
the Olympic Club game. "That of
fense that Stanford Hashed in the
first half was the prettiest I've ever
seen in America. The Hungarians in
the 1932 Olympic Games were as j
good, but no better than the boys
last. Friday night."
