# CALIFORNIA BEARS DETERMINED, NOT OVERLY CONFIDENT
## 
### Art Israel 
(Sports Editor, The California!!)
Determined, but not over-confi
dent, the 1933 edition of the Cali
fornia Varsity will invade the Stan
ford campus tomorrow for the 39th J
annual Big Game.
Coach Bill Ingrain is not con
ceeding the Indians a thing this
year despite the upset they
handed IJ.S.C. two weeks ago at
Los Angeles. The California men- I
tor figures the contest will be an
even-stephen affair with a slight
Bear advantage in the line and a i
Cardinal edge in the bacldield due
to speed.
Tomorrow's game might be culled
a preliminary to the Tournament of
Roses game as it is almost a eer- i
tainty that the winner will get the j
Western bid to meet the price of the ;
East. California wants that game
equally as much as Stanford, so to- j
morrow's contest should raise the .
two teams even higher than the av
erage Big Game pitch.
While the Stanford practice field i
has been thrown open to the pub- I
lie, Ingram has been drilling the 1
Bears behind barred gales. Opinion
differs in regard to what the Bears
are doing but Ingram promises sev
eral surprises when the Bears come
on the stadium turf tomorrow.
Change Made
The only change we know of at
present is the shifting of Frank
Walker, formerly a fullback, to No. ■
2 position. Under Ingram's system
the No. 2 back is the quarterback, j
but Walker will not be either a sig
nal caller or a safety man. His en
trance in the second team line-up
in place of little Monty Reedy adds
a heavy blocker to the Bear sec
ondary to open holes for Arleigh
Williams and Floyd Blower, No. 4
backs, who will call the plays and .
fill in the safety position on defense.
Ingram scouted the Stanford-
Montana contest last Saturday and
was amazed at the power of the In- |
dian forward wall. Although it is
composed lai'gely of sophomores, I
Ingram feels the Indian line will
cause more trouble than its backs.
Veterans Will Start
The Bear coach will start all vet
erans in the line and expects them j
to open holes in the less experienced 1
Stanford forward wall. Howard
Christie, probably the best center on i
the Coast, received the call over
Russ Calkins and Bill Stone. A pair
of seniors, Howard Morris and Art
Carlson, will fill the guard posts,
1 with Captain Johnny Ransome and
Bill Boone at tackles. Jim McCor
mick and Harry Jones will start at
the end positions.
"Chuck" Stewart will get the
opening call at the No. 2 position
with Frank Walker in reserve. Ken
Moeller was named to fill the block
ing post of No. 1 back and Jim Kee
! fer will probably start at No. 3
which corresponds to the fullback.
Should California kick off, either
Williams or Blower will start at No.
4, but should she recsive, one of
the "shock" backs, Phil Klein or
"Chuck" Cotton, will get the ball.
Field Goal
There is a fair possibility that a
field goal may decide tomorrow's
game. Bill Corbus of Stanford has
won two games by place kicks al
j ready this season, while Williams
i scored one against the Trojans for
California. Besides this field goal,
I the Bear back has successfully con
: verted eight out of eight tries for
; point after touchdown.
Augmented by the return of Chili
Bertoli, Capt. Ransome, and Blower
to practice this week, the Bears will
i be in perfect physical condition for
I the contest. Dave Meek, lanky wing
man, who received a wrenched knee
in the Santa Clara game, is the only
member of the California squad who
!will not be in a uniform.
Public opinion after the Stanford-
Trojan game has forced the Bears
; in the underdog position as far as
betting odcLs go, but to the Bear
; coaches the affair will be a toss-up
with the "hottest" team coming out
on top.

(Sports Editor, The California!!)
Determined, but not over-confi
dent, the 1933 edition of the Cali
fornia Varsity will invade the Stan
ford campus tomorrow for the 39th J
annual Big Game.
Coach Bill Ingrain is not con
ceeding the Indians a thing this
year despite the upset they
handed IJ.S.C. two weeks ago at
Los Angeles. The California men- I
tor figures the contest will be an
even-stephen affair with a slight
Bear advantage in the line and a i
Cardinal edge in the bacldield due
to speed.
Tomorrow's game might be culled
a preliminary to the Tournament of
Roses game as it is almost a eer- i
tainty that the winner will get the j
Western bid to meet the price of the ;
East. California wants that game
equally as much as Stanford, so to- j
morrow's contest should raise the .
two teams even higher than the av
erage Big Game pitch.
While the Stanford practice field i
has been thrown open to the pub- I
lie, Ingram has been drilling the 1
Bears behind barred gales. Opinion
differs in regard to what the Bears
are doing but Ingram promises sev
eral surprises when the Bears come
on the stadium turf tomorrow.
Change Made
The only change we know of at
present is the shifting of Frank
Walker, formerly a fullback, to No. ■
2 position. Under Ingram's system
the No. 2 back is the quarterback, j
but Walker will not be either a sig
nal caller or a safety man. His en
trance in the second team line-up
in place of little Monty Reedy adds
a heavy blocker to the Bear sec
ondary to open holes for Arleigh
Williams and Floyd Blower, No. 4
backs, who will call the plays and .
fill in the safety position on defense.
Ingram scouted the Stanford-
Montana contest last Saturday and
was amazed at the power of the In- |
dian forward wall. Although it is
composed lai'gely of sophomores, I
Ingram feels the Indian line will
cause more trouble than its backs.
Veterans Will Start
The Bear coach will start all vet
erans in the line and expects them j
to open holes in the less experienced 1
Stanford forward wall. Howard
Christie, probably the best center on i
the Coast, received the call over
Russ Calkins and Bill Stone. A pair
of seniors, Howard Morris and Art
Carlson, will fill the guard posts,
1 with Captain Johnny Ransome and
Bill Boone at tackles. Jim McCor
mick and Harry Jones will start at
the end positions.
"Chuck" Stewart will get the
opening call at the No. 2 position
with Frank Walker in reserve. Ken
Moeller was named to fill the block
ing post of No. 1 back and Jim Kee
! fer will probably start at No. 3
which corresponds to the fullback.
Should California kick off, either
Williams or Blower will start at No.
4, but should she recsive, one of
the "shock" backs, Phil Klein or
"Chuck" Cotton, will get the ball.
Field Goal
There is a fair possibility that a
field goal may decide tomorrow's
game. Bill Corbus of Stanford has
won two games by place kicks al
j ready this season, while Williams
i scored one against the Trojans for
California. Besides this field goal,
I the Bear back has successfully con
: verted eight out of eight tries for
; point after touchdown.
