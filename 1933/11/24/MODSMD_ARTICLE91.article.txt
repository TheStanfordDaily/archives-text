# Jolly-Up At Toyon To Follow Game Tomorrow
## 
### 
Stanfordites and guests may begin
celebrating early, if they attend
1 Toyon's annual Big Game jolly-up,
to be held Saturday afternoon, just
130 minutes after the final gun.
Gordon Heche and his orchestra
will provide the music; the campus
the dancers.
