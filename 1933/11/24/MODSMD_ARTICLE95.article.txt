# Tebbetts Consoled Squad After Northwestern Game
## 
### 
When the Stanford gridmen am
; bled dejectedly out of their dressing
room in Evanston after the North
: western game, they were surprised
j and pleased to find former swim
: ming Captain Fred Tebbetts await
! ing them with his unconquerable
| smile, in spite of the tears of salty
i consolation in his eyes.
j Tebbetts, having graduated and
| immediately taken off for South
1 America, was not even known to bo
' present on this continent. He had
reached Chicago just in time for the
game, had cheered, weeped slightly,
and departed for places unknown.
