Back in mid-summer Blue and
Gold ticket moguls began to worry
about the sale of Big Game tickets.
They looked forward to no shortage
of tickets for the all-star grid per
formance of the Coast and let down
bars that once kept out thousands
of prospective ticket-buyers.
They ruled that extension division
scholars were entitled to buy ducats
if they had the necessary $4. No
longer was it necessary to go
through four hard years of toil to
create an alumnus, a couple of
months of Fridays would do the
work.
It came about because the Cali
fornia Alumni Association Monthly
wasn't doing so well; the subscrip
tion list was falling off. Extension
division subscribers, as the new
group of lumni was called, were
given two privileges: 1. Right to ap
ply for 1933 Big Game tickets only;
2, listed as subscribers to the Cali
fornia Monthly.
