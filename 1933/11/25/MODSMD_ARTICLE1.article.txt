# GAME COLOR
## 
### 
1 p.m.—What a day for the Big
Game! Perfect football weather.
And what a crowd. The stadium
half filled already. Almost eighty
thousand people will be here today,
from all parts of the West. Hotels
overflowing everywhere on the Pen
insula. Dinner accommodations at a
premium. The New Deal has done
things for even the Big Game.
1:1/0 p.m.—Now the stands are
as crowded as a sophomore's
coupe. Anxious alumni still mill
ing around the gales, afraid they're
late. Last night they were at
alumni banquets, where some
made speeches and the rest had to
drink coco-coal to stand them.
Frenzied drivers still looking for
parking spaces. "lie who hesi
tates is honked."
1:45 p.m.—This is not the time or
place to study the art of conversa
tion. Only one topic (you have three
guesses). "Dope" talk everywhere,
scores compared, a few bets made,
everyone chatting animatedly and
expectantly. Eighty thousand people
with a single thought.
1:55 p.m.—The practice has
stirred the crowd to fever heat.
They can't wait. Neither can we.
Hardly an empty scat left. The
good scats must have been as ex
pensive as a judgship. What a
beautiful sight: thousands of
smartly dressed women, the Stan
ford rooters with white chrysan
themums and a Cardinal S, Cali
fornia supporters adorned with
yellow flowers and a blue C.
2 p.m.—The kick-off. The crowd
is on its feet. The contest has
started! Stanford's speedy backs
again.st Cal's powerful line. And
Thornhill has said that the game will
depend on the air attacks. It's going
to be a great game.
2:15 p.m.—How this crowd loves
its football. Here are all the in
veterate fans, who coinc Saturday
after Saturday. Here too arc the
thousands who go to only one
game a year. To them, football is
the Big Game. This is their big
day: they are letting themselves
go. Staid banker standing on a
wooden bench, shouting hoarsely,
"Kill them, smash them." (He has
bet SlO that the "them" will be
beaten.) Matronly housewives
thumbing through programs, hur
riedly trying to find out what it's
all about, then giving up and
shouting anyway. Debutantes and
coeds, screaming constantly, no
nvMcr hyt happens, it it's a
touchdown, or time out to take a
player's torn pants.
2:30 p.m.—This is not so much a
stadium full of football fans, as ex
citement fans. The ardent football
followers, the grandstand quarter
backs, who make a science of the
game, are outnumbered today by the
people who simply want a thrill. No
trick concealed plays for them. They
want lots of passes and thrilling
open-field running. They came for
a kick. They like the noise, the
crowds, and especially the clothes.
The Big Game clothes, compared to
those at most games, is like Ihe
Opera contrasted with a department
store basement.
2:15 p.m.—Here and there a few
of the society people arc begin
ning to look a little bored. By the
fourth quarter they will be as fas
cinated in the game as they would
be in playing crihhagc at a morti
cian's while waiting for a call.
But they'll be back again next
year. It's tough, but it's socially
necessary. Everyone who is any
one goes to the Big Game.
o
3 ..p.m.—They're telling the story
about the absent-minded professor
who was delayed. Just as he was
about to leave home he filled his
wife with gasoline, kissed his tickets
goodbye, and tried to shove his auto
mobile into his pocket.
3:15 p.m.—The rooting sections
are getting ready for the half-time
stunts. People craning to sec
what's going on. Practically all
Stanford and Cal students in their
organized sections, except a few
romantic young men who arc
girling.
3:30 p.m.—Half time. Everything
in the world for sale except perhaps
fur coats and submarines. A few
optimists still making bets.
o
3:45 p.m.—People are settling
down to a tense, analyzing watch
fulness. Lots of talk about rules.
They have been revised again this
year. Not that it makes any dif
ference, since nobody knew even
the old rules except the officials
who wrote them. And they only
knew what they were, not what
they meant.
4 p.m.—The players still playing
bang-up football, but a little tired.
Once in a while a kick almost as
weak as the wise-crack of a col
umnist. Corbus made some beautiful
kicks, as straight as a Scotchman's
course in a rented car.
o
4:15 p.m.—A few people starting
to leave to avoid the after-game
crowds. If you get gas, don't get
fresh with the fellow who wipes
off your windshield. He's prob
ably an ex-All-American football
player. —Rolph Malloch

umnist. Corbus made some beautiful
kicks, as straight as a Scotchman's

o
4:15 p.m.—A few people starting
to leave to avoid the after-game
crowds. If you get gas, don't get
fresh with the fellow who wipes
off your windshield. He's prob
ably an ex-All-American football
player. —Rolph Malloch
1 p.m.—What a day for the Big
Game! Perfect football weather.
And what a crowd. The stadium
half filled already. Almost eighty
thousand people will be here today,
from all parts of the West. Hotels
overflowing everywhere on the Pen
insula. Dinner accommodations at a
premium. The New Deal has done
things for even the Big Game.
1:1/0 p.m.—Now the stands are
as crowded as a sophomore's
coupe. Anxious alumni still mill
ing around the gales, afraid they're
late. Last night they were at
alumni banquets, where some
made speeches and the rest had to
drink coco-coal to stand them.
Frenzied drivers still looking for
parking spaces. "lie who hesi
tates is honked."
1:45 p.m.—This is not the time or
place to study the art of conversa
tion. Only one topic (you have three
guesses). "Dope" talk everywhere,
scores compared, a few bets made,
everyone chatting animatedly and
expectantly. Eighty thousand people
with a single thought.
1:55 p.m.—The practice has
stirred the crowd to fever heat.
They can't wait. Neither can we.
Hardly an empty scat left. The
good scats must have been as ex
pensive as a judgship. What a
beautiful sight: thousands of
smartly dressed women, the Stan
ford rooters with white chrysan
themums and a Cardinal S, Cali
fornia supporters adorned with
yellow flowers and a blue C.
2 p.m.—The kick-off. The crowd
is on its feet. The contest has
started! Stanford's speedy backs
again.st Cal's powerful line. And
Thornhill has said that the game will
depend on the air attacks. It's going
to be a great game.
2:15 p.m.—How this crowd loves
its football. Here are all the in
veterate fans, who coinc Saturday
after Saturday. Here too arc the
thousands who go to only one
game a year. To them, football is
the Big Game. This is their big
day: they are letting themselves
go. Staid banker standing on a
wooden bench, shouting hoarsely,
"Kill them, smash them." (He has
bet SlO that the "them" will be
beaten.) Matronly housewives
thumbing through programs, hur
riedly trying to find out what it's
all about, then giving up and
shouting anyway. Debutantes and
coeds, screaming constantly, no
nvMcr hyt happens, it it's a
touchdown, or time out to take a
player's torn pants.
2:30 p.m.—This is not so much a
stadium full of football fans, as ex
citement fans. The ardent football
followers, the grandstand quarter
backs, who make a science of the
game, are outnumbered today by the
people who simply want a thrill. No
trick concealed plays for them. They
want lots of passes and thrilling
open-field running. They came for
a kick. They like the noise, the
crowds, and especially the clothes.
The Big Game clothes, compared to
those at most games, is like Ihe
Opera contrasted with a department
store basement.
2:15 p.m.—Here and there a few
of the society people arc begin
ning to look a little bored. By the
fourth quarter they will be as fas
cinated in the game as they would
be in playing crihhagc at a morti
cian's while waiting for a call.
But they'll be back again next
year. It's tough, but it's socially
necessary. Everyone who is any
one goes to the Big Game.
o
3 ..p.m.—They're telling the story
about the absent-minded professor
who was delayed. Just as he was
about to leave home he filled his
wife with gasoline, kissed his tickets
goodbye, and tried to shove his auto
mobile into his pocket.
3:15 p.m.—The rooting sections
are getting ready for the half-time
stunts. People craning to sec
what's going on. Practically all
Stanford and Cal students in their
organized sections, except a few
romantic young men who arc
girling.
3:30 p.m.—Half time. Everything
in the world for sale except perhaps
fur coats and submarines. A few
optimists still making bets.
o
3:45 p.m.—People are settling
down to a tense, analyzing watch
fulness. Lots of talk about rules.
They have been revised again this
year. Not that it makes any dif
ference, since nobody knew even
the old rules except the officials
who wrote them. And they only
knew what they were, not what
they meant.
4 p.m.—The players still playing
bang-up football, but a little tired.

fulness. Lots of talk about rules.
They have been revised again this
year. Not that it makes any dif
ference, since nobody knew even
the old rules except the officials
who wrote them. And they only
knew what they were, not what
they meant.
4 p.m.—The players still playing
bang-up football, but a little tired.
Once in a while a kick almost as
weak as the wise-crack of a col
umnist. Corbus made some beautiful
kicks, as straight as a Scotchman's
course in a rented car.
o
4:15 p.m.—A few people starting
to leave to avoid the after-game
crowds. If you get gas, don't get
fresh with the fellow who wipes
off your windshield. He's prob
ably an ex-All-American football
player. —Rolph Malloch
1 p.m.—What a day for the Big
Game! Perfect football weather.
And what a crowd. The stadium
half filled already. Almost eighty
thousand people will be here today,
from all parts of the West. Hotels
overflowing everywhere on the Pen
insula. Dinner accommodations at a
premium. The New Deal has done
things for even the Big Game.
1:1/0 p.m.—Now the stands are
as crowded as a sophomore's
coupe. Anxious alumni still mill
ing around the gales, afraid they're
late. Last night they were at
alumni banquets, where some
made speeches and the rest had to
drink coco-coal to stand them.
Frenzied drivers still looking for
parking spaces. "lie who hesi
tates is honked."
1:45 p.m.—This is not the time or
place to study the art of conversa
tion. Only one topic (you have three
guesses). "Dope" talk everywhere,
scores compared, a few bets made,
everyone chatting animatedly and
expectantly. Eighty thousand people
with a single thought.
1:55 p.m.—The practice has
stirred the crowd to fever heat.
They can't wait. Neither can we.
Hardly an empty scat left. The
good scats must have been as ex
pensive as a judgship. What a
beautiful sight: thousands of
smartly dressed women, the Stan
ford rooters with white chrysan
themums and a Cardinal S, Cali
fornia supporters adorned with
yellow flowers and a blue C.
2 p.m.—The kick-off. The crowd
is on its feet. The contest has
started! Stanford's speedy backs
again.st Cal's powerful line. And
Thornhill has said that the game will
depend on the air attacks. It's going
to be a great game.
2:15 p.m.—How this crowd loves
its football. Here are all the in
veterate fans, who coinc Saturday
after Saturday. Here too arc the
thousands who go to only one
game a year. To them, football is
the Big Game. This is their big
day: they are letting themselves
go. Staid banker standing on a
wooden bench, shouting hoarsely,
"Kill them, smash them." (He has
bet SlO that the "them" will be
beaten.) Matronly housewives
thumbing through programs, hur
riedly trying to find out what it's
all about, then giving up and
shouting anyway. Debutantes and
coeds, screaming constantly, no
nvMcr hyt happens, it it's a
touchdown, or time out to take a
player's torn pants.
2:30 p.m.—This is not so much a
stadium full of football fans, as ex
citement fans. The ardent football
followers, the grandstand quarter
backs, who make a science of the
game, are outnumbered today by the
people who simply want a thrill. No
trick concealed plays for them. They
want lots of passes and thrilling
open-field running. They came for
a kick. They like the noise, the
crowds, and especially the clothes.
The Big Game clothes, compared to
those at most games, is like Ihe
Opera contrasted with a department
store basement.
2:15 p.m.—Here and there a few
of the society people arc begin
ning to look a little bored. By the
fourth quarter they will be as fas
cinated in the game as they would
be in playing crihhagc at a morti
cian's while waiting for a call.
But they'll be back again next
year. It's tough, but it's socially
necessary. Everyone who is any
one goes to the Big Game.
o
3 ..p.m.—They're telling the story
about the absent-minded professor
who was delayed. Just as he was
about to leave home he filled his
wife with gasoline, kissed his tickets
goodbye, and tried to shove his auto
mobile into his pocket.
3:15 p.m.—The rooting sections
are getting ready for the half-time
stunts. People craning to sec
what's going on. Practically all
Stanford and Cal students in their
organized sections, except a few
romantic young men who arc
girling.
3:30 p.m.—Half time. Everything
in the world for sale except perhaps
fur coats and submarines. A few
optimists still making bets.
