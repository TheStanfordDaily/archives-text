# The 						Big Fun
## 
### 
There are certain tilings intimately associated wilh the
Big Game. There is the stadium, for instance. There is
the football team. II .is hard to consider the Bit* (lame
[without these factors. But just as hard is it to think about
the Big (lame without remembering the "Big (lame (Â«ai
eties."
The fun is wild and abandoned. That is the nicest way
to describe the hilarity. Campus humorists, dancers, mu
sicians strain to produce it. And for those that can still
gel a ticket, it is a tremendous production to witness. It is
stupendous, even in rehearsal. There is nothing like it
during the year. Nothing could be like it.
The Big (lame comes only once a year!
