# MISTAKES HAPPEN

### 
The Editor. Sir:
Over the telephone this morning,
a friend called my attention to the
article in today's Daily leaded, '"O.
H. Blackmail to solve troubles of
transfers."
I read the article with a mixture
of shock and amusement. Then I
realized that some writer being
short of copy must have dug up a
letter sent out during the summer
to all new transfers and signed
jointly by the Interfraternity Coun
cil, the Interclub Council, and the
Student Committee.
This letter stated lhat a central
office had been provided where new
transfers could get information re
garding fraternities and eating
clubs. Room 173 was temporarily
loaned for this service and I was on
duty there for this service. But the
time was specifically limited to Reg
istration Day and the afternoons of
October 4, 5, and 6..
From this slender base the writer
in the Daily seems to have conjured
up a permanent organization to cov
er other campus activities, which
include the sweeping statement that
"Mr. Blackman is prepared to solve
the difficulties of all students, but
especially junior transfers and new
students of all ranks."
Well, as Will Rogers so often
says, "All I know is what I read
in the papers," but for the sake of
some students who might take this
article too seriously, let me say that
I am 110 longer included in the fac
ulty list and have no connection
with the Universityâ€”either officially
or unofficially.
In order to prevent embarrass
ment of any kind, will you print this
letter in tomorrow's Daily?
I am sure this is just a journalistic
error and that you will gladly print
the facts.
Sincerely yours,
O. H. Blackman
