RAOUL PAUSE with
BALLET MODERNE
Palo Alto Community Theatre
Raoul Pause, almost self-consci
ously serious, possesses a dramatic
intensity which makes the energy of
1 the Fire God and the &gony of A
, Martyr alive and veal. Hut his lighter
dances were unimaginative, and the
sameness of gesture in the Tempta
tions of St. Anthony was downright
I monotonous.
Harry Hamilton, possessing the
humor Pause lacks, is also the bet
ter dancer; his calm precision and
easy grace made Temple Song and
Ritual beautiful studies in form and
pattern. His Waterfront Sketch was
flippant, brash, and thoroughly en
gaging. Luva Stratton imitates grace
by bending in segments; her Sa
lome, a calculated attempt at sen
suousness, was so mechanical as to
leave the audience unblushing.
, The choreography, sometimes pos
sessing great origirfality, suffered
; from lack of precision, especially in
the lamentable St. Anthony episode.
The company of ten females waved
| perpetual arms never in exact uni
; son. The old trick of scarves was
j again effective, aided by excellent
lighting.
Great imagination was evident in
the conception of Valse Triste, and
A Queen is Loved by A Jester; and
Pause's portrayal of the crucifixion
was ingenious, sincerely dignified,
and realistically horrible. Nice ar
rangement of figures in static groups
may be credited to Pause, but the
moderne quality of the ballet was
too often imitative of Wigman and
Kreutzberg.
In toto v u very uneven program—
with honors to Hamilton, Pause's
vigor, lighting, costumes, and ex
pressirve masks, and several good
embryonic ideas. — Brauns

RICHARD OF BORDEAUX. A

i play in two acts and twelve scenes.
By Gordon Daviot. Little, Brown,
' and Company, Boston, 1933. (At
the Stanford Bookstore Circulat
ing Library.)
Gordon Daviot has made of the
reign of England's Richard II a sen
sitive and fine drama. He has over
come the problems attendant upon
the composition of any historical
play, particularly upon one bound
to a particular historical figure.
He has not fallen into the pitfalls
' of rhetorical prose nor has he writ
ten from the point of view, of the
debunking mouernist who depends
for his comic effect upon the device
of an historically misplaced wise
c.rask.
The play is in simple, natural
' prose and only once does it seem
insufficiently brilliant. To frompare
'his with the Shakespearian treat
ment of the quarrel between Boling
broke and Mowbray is palpably
unfair, but inevitable. Here Daviot's
prose seems, for the moment, too
flatly colloquial. But it is probable
that in actual production, to the on
looker fully in the spirit of the play
and not having a copy of Richard II
befoi-e him, the scene's unquestion
able power would be manifest.
Daviot's Richard is a young man,
fully aware of the reason for his
relatives' opposition to his pacific
ideals, but determined to thwart it.
His first outspoken, direct attempts
failing, he resorts to strategy, plays

one off against the other. But, be*
reft of a wife beloved, and ex
hausted by the struggle, lie falls
himself—but not before he has
known himself to be justified.
He is a brilliant, quick-tempered,
extraordinarily sensitive man, forced
by a keen sense of honor to dismiss
his dear friend, Robert de Vere, be -
cause that friend has proven him
self a coward. But it is to the exiled
but still loved Robert that he ad
dresses his last, satiric words before
he is taken to a Pomfret Castle dun
geon and inevitable extinction.
Shakespeare, careless, too much
dependent upon his audience's
knowledge of English history, has
failed to detail in a great deal of
the motivation for his characters'
actions. Daviot does not.
The play begins with the 19-year
old Richard, storming furiously out
of a council of scheming relatives
who are determined to exert their
physical powers if their rhetoric is
insufficient to convert Richard to a
policy of constant war with France.
It ends with the captive but un
broken king's abdication.
Thus it covers a far wider period,
in sharply selected episodes, only
one of which (concerned with Bol
ingbroke's move to return .to Eng
land) is not focused upon Richard.
But Daviot has not built up his
protagonist to the deprecation of
other characters. All of them are
sharply pictured, from the life-lov
ing Earl of Oxford, Robert de Vere,
to the dull, imaginative but power
ful Henry Bolingbroke.
The play is not unrelievedly sol
emn in tone; its comic moments are
many—all of them satiric, none of
them irrelevant. It is a fine achieve
ment, this "Richard of Bordeaux"
and when it reaches this country it
should enjoy as great success as it
has in England, where Mr. John
Gielgud's portrait of Richard seems
to have done justice to Mr. Daviot's
script. I think it may not be exag
geration to place the play along with
the finest modem dramas of its type.
