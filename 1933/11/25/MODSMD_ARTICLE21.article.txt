# Sophomore Bids for Fame By Library Stunt Antics
## 
### 
Prompted by a $5 stake, a member
of Stanford's famed sophomore class,
with the agility of a cat, sprang lip
i on top of the book shelves in the
Library's main reading room at sec
tion 61 last night, walked ntmcha- '
lantly along the wall until he !
reached the section numbered 102,
and jumped down, collecting his bet.
Astounded seven - o'clock grinds ,
clapped, cheered upon the l'eat's
completion. Reading room custo
dians merely watched , proceedings,
and allowed the acrobat and his
I prompters to walk unmolested from
the building.

"On to the Rose Bowl" was also
the Oregon cry as their team pre
pared for last week's game with
u.s.c.
