# Former Swiss Soccer Star Ineligible in 1933
## 
### 
A1 Navarro, tricky little inside on
Harry Maloney's soccer squad, is in
eligible because he attended the
University of Lausanne in Switzer
land last year.
Speaking of his former alma ma
ter, Navarro holds, "the Swiss study
so hard that students are prohibited
from participating in athletics of
any kind. A bunch of us would
sneak out on Saturday afternoons
with a soccer ball for some surrep
titious exercise. But the authorities
thought that all work and no play
made Jack a smart boy."
