# CARDS, U.C. HOLD SAME RECORDS IN ROSE BOWL TILTS
## Whoever Secures Bid Plays Four Bowl Games 
### 
If the Stanford Cardinal should
get a bid to represent the West in
this year's Rose Bowl contest, it
will be the fourth game in the Pasa
dena stadium for that team. If Cali
fornia plays, it will likewise be the j
fourth game for the Bears. Both
have similar records —one loss, one
win, and one tie each.
Notre Dame Fray
The most memorable game from [
the Stanford standpoint was the ;
1925 game against Notre Dame. Aid- 1
ed by Ernie Nevers, the Redskins
rolled up 17 first downs ugainst the .
Ramblers, and yet lost the game
27-10. In 1927 Stanford and Ala- j
bama tied 7-7, and in 1928 Stanford
beat Pittsburg, 7-6.
The Golden Bear's first appear- ,
arice was an auspicious victory over
Ohio State, when Andy Smith's 1920
Wonder Team won 28-0. • That was
the game of the famous 70-yard
pats, "Brick" Muller to Brodie Ste
phens.
In 1922 another Wonder Team bat
tled to a scoreless tie with Washing
to nand Jefferson. In 1929, Georgia
Tech edged California out, 8-7, scor
ing a safety after Roy Reigels had
run the wrong way.
S.C. Has Record
Southern California has probably
the best Rose Bowl record; the 1
Thundering Herd has played four
and won four contests. In 1923 S.C.
beat Penn State, 14-3, and then
there was a seven-year holiday for
Troy.
In 1930 S.C. rolled up the record
score of the East-West classic, 47
points against Pitsburg's 14. In 1932
they downed Tulane, 21-12, in one
of the game's hardest fought battles,
with Dalyrimple, Shaver, and Pin
chevt starring.
Last season Southern California
again appeared against Pittsburg,
trouncing the Panthers 35-0.
