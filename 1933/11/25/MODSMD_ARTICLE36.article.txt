# Stanford "Hello" Slogan Fails at Washington U.
## 
### 
Stanford's "Hello" tradition went
through an acid test at the Univer
sity of Washington recently when a
reporter's curiosity led him on a
campus tour to find out just how
much of "Hello Day" was merely
tradition and how much was an ac
tual practice. Results: First co-ed,
coldly, "I don't believe I've met
you." Trio of co-eds, no response.
Four hundred students pouring
out of classes, flying wedge tactics
that shoved the still undaunted re
porter to the bottom of a flight of
steps. Three more tries; no more
success. A fellow journalist, not a
glance in order that, as the reporter
later learned, the girl companion
would not know that journalist 2
knew journalist 1.
Finally, two cheery "hellos"â€”one
from a fraternity brother and the
other from the general chairman of
"Hello Day."
