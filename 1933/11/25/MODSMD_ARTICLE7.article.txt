i What are football players made
i of? As the war was said to be won
! through the stomachs of the soldiers,
j the successful 1933 football season
may be attributed to some extent to
the new, scientific training diet used
for the first time this year.
Working on the theory that foot-
I ball players need the same basic
{ d'et as ordinary people, except for
quantity, the Varsity training table
I no longer features great quantities
of starchy foods that put on weight
but not muscle.
Diet Approved
The basic diet, that meets with the
hearty approval of the team because
it provides for greater variety of
' food as well as keeping them in bet
; ter physical shape, is as follows:
One quart of milk; two servings
' of fruit; rye, corn, or whole wheat
bread twice daily; two vegetables,
one leafy and one root; potatoes;
three pats of butter; egg; meat or

] fish oncc daily; and whole grain cc-
J real.
I This is the perfect diet for any
j person, the difference being a mat
! ter of some 2000 more calorics for
|a football player than for the aver
j age student.
Travel Diets
Another diet feature of this sea
j son is the careful planning of meals
I when the team made trips to Chi
cago and Washington. Three weeks
j beforehand, complete menus for
j each day were given to the railroad
j cooks who complied with them to
the extent of buying new provisions
j if necessary.
In accordance with conference
1 rules, only one meal can be served
! the team at a regular Varsity train
; ing table. Since this is dinner, held
nightly at the Union, breakfast, and
luncheon are gotten at fraternities
and eating clubs where enthusiastic
chefs are more than willing to carry ,
out the principles of the basic diets
for the benefit <>f font hall heroes. [
