# STANFORD BEATS CAL
## Williams Scores For California Early In Game Boby Grayson, Van Dellen, and Hamilton Lead Indian Attack on Strong California Team; Stanford Intercepts Pass in Third Quarter FINAL SCORE 7 TO 3 STANFORD SCORED AT THE LAST MINUTE 
### 
Stanford was a scoring threat surging most of the fourth
quarter, but after several heart-breaking attempts within 10
yards of a touchdown, California regained the ball.

Before the game started this afternoon, Stanford was in
line for the coveted honor of representing the West in the
annual Rose Bowl classic. This afternoon's game did not
cinch the choice for any team. For the first time in years,
however, the result of the Big Game practically decides the
Rose Bowl team, and thus carries with it more than the mere
satisfaction at trouncing a traditional rival.
Although the game today virtually settles the choicc, a
Rose Bowl competitor will not be officially selected until
sometime next month. Hal Reynolds, chairman of the Rose
Bowl football committee, said yesterday, "Stanford, Califor
nia, and Southern California are the outstanding contestants.
If Stanford beats California tomorrow, the Indians probably
will be called. While opinion prevails that it would be best
that the Trojans did not get the bid the third straight year,
defeat of Stanford by California along with the U.S.C. vic
tories over Notre Dame. Georgia, and Washington probably
force the Trojans into the picture."

The first quarter showed the two teams fairly equal, with
the Cardinal players appearing to be a little stronger. Thorn
hill's men gained more yards, but ileit+ier team came very near
to scoring except for All-American Corbus' attempt at a field
goal, which missed by only a few yards.
Near the end of the second quarter Williams made three
points for California by a place kick from the 25-yard line.
Williams figured prominently in many of the U.C. plays, car
rying the ball for gains time after time. Stanford came back
strong, stopping U.C. in a touchdown attempt and gaining
the ball.
The spectators were on their feet most of the second quar
, ter, Grayson and Van Dellen carrying the ball for Stanford
for substantial gains, but prevented from scoring by the Uni
versity of California's strong line.
Near the end of the half, Stanford put in several substi
tutes after taking time out, but the gun ended the period
while the ball was still near mid-field.
Williams kicking gave Cal a lead, through the recovery
of a fumble. Williams' passing led to the opportunity to kick.
Stanford showed a shade better offensive power during the
first half, but was stopped on the California 20-yard line in a
scoring attempt.
Between the halves a spectacular show was offered the
crowd. The Cal section spelled Hello Cards and various other
slogans and gestures. The Cardinal rooting section made a
beautiful Indian head with their colored cards, and then made
the Indian doff his hat.
Stunts on the field amused the spectators, Bill Ingram and
an Indian princess being the most popular figures dcpictcd.
o
Today the Stanford Axe entered upon its new career as a
Big Game trophy. No longer a cause for personal conflict be
tween Stanford and California students, the Axe was in the
Stanford rooting section all during the game. After the game,
the chromium-painted trophy left in the hands of the Student
Body president of the winning university.
