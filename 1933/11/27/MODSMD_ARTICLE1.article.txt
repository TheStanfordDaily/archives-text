Scarcely had word of the discov
ery filtered through San Jose than
angry revengeful crowds of vigi
lantes gathered about the delapi
dated jail, milled about muttering
threats of lynching. Soon official
notice of their intention was served
on worried Sheriff Emig. Emissaries
of underground vigilante committee
told him efforts at defense of mur
derers Holmes and Thurmond would
he useless, advised him not to let his
deputies get hurt.

Meanwhile culprits paced their in
secure (from the outside) cells, well
aware that chances were very slim
indeed. They may be tried for mur
der and kidnapping, both punishable
by death, as well as for federal
charges carrying 122 years all told.
Chances that Judge Lynch will beat
state and U.S. to the draw.
