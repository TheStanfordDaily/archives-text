# Safe from U.C. Capture, Axe Remains on Farm
## 
### FRANK ORR 
Stanford's famous Axe, endeared
to hearts of generations of students
through raids and captures, re
mained at the Farm today, safe from
California custody for another year
at least.
Adopted by Stanford in 185)9,
swiped by Cal almost immediately,
and recaptured by the "21" in 1930,
the emblem was a constant source
of rivalry between the two univer
sities until the Daily's editorial de
mand that it be made a Big Game
trophy was heeded last year.
In custody of Jerry Trautman,
A.S.S.U. president, the 10-pound
trophy was taken to a San Francisco
firm to be mounted and engraved.
Shorn of its age-old rust, the handle
shortened, and its edge highly pol
ished, the Axe was mounted on a
two-fool board with space for the
name of the winning university and

' the score.
Its appearance at Wednesday eve- I
rung's rally, carried by two of the
famous Committee of 21, was the [
signal for general bedlam as men i
and women rose to their feet and
yelled a greeting to the almost
mythical trophy.
Its appearance at the rally and at
Saturday's game caused no concern
for its safety, an agreement between
California and Stanford student
(body officers having guaranteed the
I safety of the Axe as a Big Game
trophy.
A presentation ceremony was ar
ranged, to be used in case California
won the game, by which the emblem
would be officially transferred acros.s
the bay for the next year. -The Axe
itself was there, ready for the pre
sentation, in case
