# FRENZIED MOB LYNCHES KILLERS OF BROOKE HART
## Mutilated Bodies Hanged in Park 
### 
John Holmes and Thomas Thurmond, slayers of Brooke
Hart, were lynched at 11:25 o'clock last night by an out
raged mob of 20,000 San Jose citizens thought led by students
of the University of Santa Clara and friends of the mur
dered boy.
With the aid of an iron crow bar, ringleaders smashed in
the door of the Santa Clara County jail.
They tore Holmes and Thurmond out of the hands of
police, dragged them half naked across the street to St. James
Park, and hung the two killers from a tree.
Battered and beaten by the angry mob, Thurmond was un
conscious when the lynching occurred. Holmes resisted the
lynchers, slipped out of the noose twice, but then was jerked
to his doom.
Police, who previously had kept off the crowds which
beseiged the jail with tear gas bombs, offered no resistance
when the men were finally dragged from the jail.
The bodies, that of Holmes stark naked, were left hanging
in the Park. Sadistic hordes yelled, screamed with glee as
the corpses swung in a gentle breeze.
The door to the cell where Thurmond and Holmes had
been held under heavy guard had been partially battered
down before the men were actually 'taken. Suddenly, as the
rioters rushed the door for another attack, police exhausted
their supply of tear gas bombs, their gun jammed, and the
two cringing men were left to the mercy of the mob.
The thousands began gathering around the jail earlier in
the afternoon following the discovery of the mutilated body
of Brooke Hart in the waters of San Francisco Bay.
Police, fearing a lynching party, had taken Holmes and
Thurmond to safety in San Francisco shortly after they were
captured. The confessed killers were removed to the San
Jose jail but a short while ago, when it was thought that pop
ular resentment had partially subsided.
The St. James Park, bathed in the white light of a half
moon, offered a ghastly spectacle. As the bodies continued
to dangle from their respective JreeÂ§, a sepulchural silence
settled over the place.
Suddenly, wild shrieks burst out. Someone set a torch
to Thurmond's clothes. But police rescued both bodies be
fore anything more could be done.
The lynching came as the brutal climax to one of the most
brutal and cold-blooded murders in local crime annals. It
came following the refusal of Governor Rolph earlier in the
day to call out National Guardsmen to protect the murderers.
