# 1933 GAIETIES LAUDED, BOOED BY BIG HOUSE
## Helvenston's Work, Heche Music, Boone and Kelly Dances Praised 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
The first thing lhat could be said
about Friday night's Gaieties audi- i
ence is that it filled the house, which j
should warm the cockles of the Dra- i
matic Council's heart.
The last thing that could be said |
about the spectators would be that
they were reticent in expressing
their emotions. On the contrary,
they reacted with an alacrity that
was amazing and left little doubt
as to their opinions, good and bad.
It was a show which would have
been vastly improved by the gentle j
process of selection and organiza
tion. Many of the acts were not j
funny, some were old, and all too
many were puns of the worst order ,
(and here's whei'e the audience j
came in). But beside these were
many numbers which would have !
done credit to any show, and which |
in themselves would have made a I
winning production.
Heckscher Outstanding
Popular opinion awarded the eve- j
ning's laurel wreath to Ernest Heck- j
scher, who appeared armed only .
with his banjo, and who departed i
with the greatest ovation of the eve- j
ning—and a well-earned one it was, I
too.
Now, Winstead Weaver is one of j
the funniest and cleverest comedians !
I have ever seen; his songs are good, j
some of his sketches excellent, and j
his clowning delightful, but he j
should not be wasted on feeble j
blackouts and front-curtain* num- I
bers. "I Don't Fool Around," sung
by him in Act I, was swell.
Out of the nowhere into the here ;
came an amazing, insane comic
named Jim Copp, whose "Soliloquy"
was one of the highlights of the eve- |
ning. Why not a good sparring act I
between Copp and Weaver? —it
would out-Marx the Marxes. j
Brash Number Good
Musically, the cleverest conception
lof the evening was John Brash's
I "Dark Journey," a fine idea backed
i up with fine music, and the very
! intelligent dancing of Mary Anita
: Loos and George Wilson. It suffered
from sketchy treatment and orches
! tration, and would have been a
i knockout if expanded. The vocaT
i chorus, ably led by Bob Stoddard,
j was almost professional in this se
! quence.
The dancing choruses were ex
| ceptionally effective in the stilts
I number and the chain gang se
i quence—good ideas well done.
Of the sketches, the Pi Phi's prize
[ winning effort was easily outstand
ing. Barbara Balfour and Katrina
I Wallingford heie made a highly
J amusing sketch around the well-
J worn "800" gag, augmenting it with
j tricky musical parodies. Miss Wal
lingford was also responsible for the
j Cowardesque "Even More Private,"
| cleverly enacted by herself and the
j redoubtable Paul Speegle.
Microphone Hampers
j The singers—of which there was
J both quality and quantity—were im
j measurably hampered by the micro
! phone raising and lowering, which
! was done with such deftness that
j the mike generally managed, after
| much manipulation, to be precisely
!in front of the singer's face, thus
I hiding it completely.
j The quality element was chiefly
} represented by Pete Peck, whose
! very pleasing voice added materially
j to every song he rendered. Virginia
1 Marvin has both voice and stag®
! presence;, and she made an excellent
impression in her number. Doro
thy Bernhardt's catchy tunes were
pleasantly handled by Mary Louise
Stewart and Bud Bernhardt, and A1
Woodward proved an able songster
in his numbers. Mark Joy's indif
: ferent singing, however, failed to
justify the elaborate staging she re
ceived.
| All in all, a good show, with credit
to Heche's musical ability, the
Boone-Kelly dance direction, and to
' the general direction of Harold Hel
: venston.

| All in all, a good show, with credit
to Heche's musical ability, the
Boone-Kelly dance direction, and to
' the general direction of Harold Hel
: venston.
The first thing lhat could be said
about Friday night's Gaieties audi- i
ence is that it filled the house, which j
should warm the cockles of the Dra- i
matic Council's heart.
The last thing that could be said |
about the spectators would be that
they were reticent in expressing
their emotions. On the contrary,
they reacted with an alacrity that
was amazing and left little doubt
as to their opinions, good and bad.
It was a show which would have
been vastly improved by the gentle j
process of selection and organiza
tion. Many of the acts were not j
funny, some were old, and all too
many were puns of the worst order ,
(and here's whei'e the audience j
came in). But beside these were
many numbers which would have !
done credit to any show, and which |
in themselves would have made a I
winning production.
Heckscher Outstanding
Popular opinion awarded the eve- j
ning's laurel wreath to Ernest Heck- j
scher, who appeared armed only .
with his banjo, and who departed i
with the greatest ovation of the eve- j
ning—and a well-earned one it was, I
too.
Now, Winstead Weaver is one of j
the funniest and cleverest comedians !
I have ever seen; his songs are good, j
some of his sketches excellent, and j
his clowning delightful, but he j
should not be wasted on feeble j
blackouts and front-curtain* num- I
bers. "I Don't Fool Around," sung
by him in Act I, was swell.
Out of the nowhere into the here ;
came an amazing, insane comic
named Jim Copp, whose "Soliloquy"
was one of the highlights of the eve- |
ning. Why not a good sparring act I
between Copp and Weaver? —it
would out-Marx the Marxes. j
Brash Number Good
Musically, the cleverest conception
lof the evening was John Brash's
I "Dark Journey," a fine idea backed
i up with fine music, and the very
! intelligent dancing of Mary Anita
: Loos and George Wilson. It suffered
from sketchy treatment and orches
! tration, and would have been a
i knockout if expanded. The vocaT
i chorus, ably led by Bob Stoddard,
j was almost professional in this se
! quence.
The dancing choruses were ex
| ceptionally effective in the stilts
I number and the chain gang se
i quence—good ideas well done.
Of the sketches, the Pi Phi's prize
[ winning effort was easily outstand
ing. Barbara Balfour and Katrina
I Wallingford heie made a highly
J amusing sketch around the well-
J worn "800" gag, augmenting it with
j tricky musical parodies. Miss Wal
lingford was also responsible for the
j Cowardesque "Even More Private,"
| cleverly enacted by herself and the
j redoubtable Paul Speegle.
Microphone Hampers
j The singers—of which there was
J both quality and quantity—were im
j measurably hampered by the micro
! phone raising and lowering, which
! was done with such deftness that
j the mike generally managed, after
| much manipulation, to be precisely
!in front of the singer's face, thus
I hiding it completely.
j The quality element was chiefly
} represented by Pete Peck, whose
! very pleasing voice added materially
j to every song he rendered. Virginia
