# Happy Fans Fight, Enjoy Post Mortems on Game
## 
### JAY GRAVES 
"Seven to three, pal—jus' seven
to three. Boy, oh boy, can we hand I
it out! Did we take you mugs? !
Geez, wot a game, wot a team!"
"Aw, you guys were plain lucky. ;
How about that fourth quarter I
drive. Firs' down and four left— |
whew, wotta break! Jus' lucky you
held us. 'Ats all."
The Big Game was fought over
again something like 1,492 times as;
elated students and self-important i
alumni rubbed it in to a Berkeley I
bunch that had plenty of argument, j
Then when the matter was set- j
tied, or unsettled, once again, sons
and ex-sons of the Red and the Blue
and Gold put their arms around
over each other's shoulders and had |
"c'mon, jus' one more, li'l one" i
("make it stiff, pal")—then sang de- j
risive songs about U.S.C.
Hotels were crowded — students
and San Franciscans were hilarious.
Paper "silk topper" favors looked
like accordions. Groups and pairs

migrated from one hotel to another.
Then to Joe's or Ernie's when re
freshments ran low.
"H'ray, 'at's fine—don't need a
eard any more. Boy, repeal is sure
a fine thing. Wide open from now
on, huh?"
'"Say lissen, you, if you think I'm
going to lay out a stone for a bottle (
of ginger ale or White Rock, you're ;
crazy. . . . Huh? Sure I'll tell the
manager."
Alumni were "back." Were in
vited "up to the room an' have one
on u.s." Pairs and parties went from
one free drink to the next -Stanford
and St. Mary's, St. Mary's and Cal
—a big beef. Then everybody paci
fied, everybody pals.
Around 4 a.m.—"Say, buddy, how
about a ride back to Paly?"
Sunday morning at the Cellar.
"How'd the date turn out?" "Aw,
shut up." "Wotta night, wotta hang -
over." "Hey, whatsa matter with
this food? It all tastes the same."
