# Mob Murder in San Jose?
## 
### 
The mo]> is milling in San Jose. They are milling and
calling lor action. They arc crying for the blood of the two
kidnappers of Brooke Hart.
The sheriff has promised speedy trial and speedy con
viction is a foregone result. But that is not enough. The
mob, the brutal savage beneath a coaling of mechanical
progress and a little imposed restraint from above, wants
the satisfaction of a more immediate and more personal
killing than that provided for by the law.
The men are guilty; they have perpetrated a vile crime.
"Why wait for a trial?" cry the howling mob that Surges
before the jail in San Jose.
The difference in value between the lives of the two
murderers and of Brooke Hart is not the question involved.
The value of law and order is at stake. If a mob can hang
John Holmes and Thomas Thurmond, our advance over
medieval justice is slight. 11' a mob can hang these two, it
can hang anyone else that it dislikes sufficiently. The sanc
tity of the individual is gone. The progress of society from
cave and forest is lost.
Sheriff Emig realized the situation which led inevitably
to this killing by a wild mob. It behooves him to act before
this outrage to decent society was allowed. If it was neces
sary to remove the prisoners to some other city, he should
have removed them. If it was necessary to have procured
additional armed protection, that precaution should have
been taken.
The mob has wrested two men from the hands of the
law. The mob has killed these men. Their blood is on
Sheriff Emig's hands. But more than the blood of these
two men is on the sheriff's conscience: the pitiful spectacle
of a powerless law overcome by mob-lawlessness is also
on Emig's conscience.
In the San Jose St. James* Park hang the bodies of two
naked men. They bear the marks of mob violence. They
hang by their necks. They are dead.
Their waving bodies hang as an insult to modern so
ciety, a disgrace to the County of Santa Clara for permit
ting this outrage, and a damning condemnation of the
people who participated in the crime.
