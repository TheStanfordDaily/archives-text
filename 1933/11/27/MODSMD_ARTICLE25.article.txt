# This Unfortunate Accident
## 
### 
Two Stanford students who were alive Saturday are
dead today. A third is seriously injured. That is tlie local
conclusion to an unfortunate collision Sunday morning.
To the campus, the deaths are horrifyingly unreal. It is
almost impossible to realize that two of our classmates
live no more.
Hut to the outside world the accident has different
meaning. To them, it is just another blaring story of reck
less college youth on a wild spree. To them it indicates
that liquor is horrible, that automobiles arc a vice, that
collegians are half-mad. And of course, that the combina
tion of the three is a national calamity. The fact that the
driver was completely sober; the fact that accidents hap
pen just us frequently with non-collegians has no bearing
on their deductions, more properly, their prejudices.
if John Doe collides with Tom Smith, that is an acci
dent. If Stanford students smash up, that is not only sensa
tional news but a great illustration of national trends. Fur
ther, it is taken as a direct indictment of the University.
It is treated as if Doctor Wilbur were at the wheel of every
campus automobile; or failing that, he personally sanc
tioned accidents.
It is unfortunate that Donn Tatum will be the target
for 11 m mud of old maids of both sexes who fondly cherish
such primitive motions. His innocence will be no shield
against this abuse.
* * *
The campus will sympathize with Tatum but it also
sympathizes with the parents of the dead. The agony of
building and hoping and then having that creation and
those hopes crushed is immense. It is the greatest sorrow
that parents know. Xo misery can compare with it.
We, the youth, have everything. Yet having everything,
we care less about death than those who have little remain
ing. That is the paradox. That is the unfathomable to our
elders. Hut life to them is a serious business. It is still an
adventurous sport to us. That is why we can play it with
out fear.
Hut last night's accident will have its effect on the whole
campus for months to come. That sudden smash on the
Hayshore highway will ring in our ears. The tragedy of
the uncompleted lives just reaching full stride will sear
our comprehensions. It cannot help hilt alter our realiza
tion of things for time to come.

1 11c Daily Staff will meet today as is their custom at
1: 1.") o'clock. The Big Game comes only once a year—but
it is over. Headaches, internal disturbances, or "just hack
Irom the city" will not he appropriate excuses.

dead today. A third is seriously injured. That is tlie local
conclusion to an unfortunate collision Sunday morning.
To the campus, the deaths are horrifyingly unreal. It is
almost impossible to realize that two of our classmates
live no more.
Hut to the outside world the accident has different
meaning. To them, it is just another blaring story of reck
less college youth on a wild spree. To them it indicates
that liquor is horrible, that automobiles arc a vice, that
collegians are half-mad. And of course, that the combina
tion of the three is a national calamity. The fact that the
driver was completely sober; the fact that accidents hap
pen just us frequently with non-collegians has no bearing
on their deductions, more properly, their prejudices.
if John Doe collides with Tom Smith, that is an acci
dent. If Stanford students smash up, that is not only sensa
tional news but a great illustration of national trends. Fur
ther, it is taken as a direct indictment of the University.
It is treated as if Doctor Wilbur were at the wheel of every
campus automobile; or failing that, he personally sanc
tioned accidents.
It is unfortunate that Donn Tatum will be the target
for 11 m mud of old maids of both sexes who fondly cherish
such primitive motions. His innocence will be no shield
against this abuse.
* * *
The campus will sympathize with Tatum but it also
sympathizes with the parents of the dead. The agony of
building and hoping and then having that creation and
those hopes crushed is immense. It is the greatest sorrow
that parents know. Xo misery can compare with it.
We, the youth, have everything. Yet having everything,
we care less about death than those who have little remain
ing. That is the paradox. That is the unfathomable to our
elders. Hut life to them is a serious business. It is still an
adventurous sport to us. That is why we can play it with
out fear.
Hut last night's accident will have its effect on the whole
campus for months to come. That sudden smash on the
Hayshore highway will ring in our ears. The tragedy of
the uncompleted lives just reaching full stride will sear
our comprehensions. It cannot help hilt alter our realiza
tion of things for time to come.

1 11c Daily Staff will meet today as is their custom at
1: 1.") o'clock. The Big Game comes only once a year—but
it is over. Headaches, internal disturbances, or "just hack
Irom the city" will not he appropriate excuses.
