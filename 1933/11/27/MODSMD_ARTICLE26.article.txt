I I'M NO ANGEL (Paramount)
■ At the Stanford Theatre
This is*one of those pictures which
a reviewer can discuss with the
comforting knowledge that nothing
J she says will make one whit of dif
ference. Mae West, like the depres
sion, is a national institution, and
has come to have all the attention
commonly accorded the same.
"I'm No Angel" suffers the lot of
all sequels—not that it is in any way
connected with "She Done Him
Wrong," but it will forever be com
pared with that first phenomenon.
If it had appeared first it would
probably have been the bomshell
that the other one was, but as it is,
people will probably be disappointed
in "I'm No Angel," largely because
they are determined to be.
I expected to be disappointed, and !
i my only disappointment was that I i
j was not disappointed. West is still i
West, and "I'm No Angel" is super- i
lative entertainment.
The story of Tira, the circus,
dancer and tamer of men and lions, j
is told with a maximum of gusto j
and the snappy, sharp, and slightly ;
racy dialog which only Mae West !
can write. It is to be regretted that
the theatre advertisements have so !
completely appropriated the best and
most characteristic lines, thereby;
taking away some of their tang. But
people will probably become just as
addicted to some of these lines as to
some (not mentioning any names) j
of the former opus.
As usual, and also as might be ex
pected, the star is the whole show,
and if her characterization is any j
less frank and less thorough, it is
J probably because the Gay Nineties
seems to distinctly her metier, and
the present film is in a modern set
ting. But she makes a clearly de
fined and thoroughly consistent in- j
dividual of Tira, and what more
could one ask?
The songs of the show are some- ;
what furtively interpolated, toyed
with for a moment, and then they \
disappear—which will disappoint;
some. And some will be bothered 1
by having the star announced with i
fanfares of trumpets and gilded cur
tains and other impediments, and j
also by having her surrounded with
an army of negro maids who serve I
as "feeders" for some of the lines— j
a fairly simple device.
Mae is still a fast-moving girl who I
likes 'em slow, and Cary Grant is
charming as the hero, a role of
which he makes the most. The oth
ers in the cast were amazingly ob
scure, through no fault of their own.
