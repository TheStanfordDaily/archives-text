# REINHARDT REVISES VON UNRUH'S PLAY 'LOUIS FERDINAND'
## Cardinal Savant Simplifies Classic Drama 
### Helene Ottenheimer 
An excellent edition has just been
published by Dr. Kurt F. Rcinhardt,
learned associate professor of Ger
man at Stanford, of Fritz von Un
ruh's "Prinz Louis Ferdinand," one
of the finest creations of expres
sionistic drama.
The play was first published in
1913, but this edition is a superb
one, since Dr. Reinhardt understands
that the German student must con
quer great obstacles in unconven
tional exuberance of the work.
Reinhardt Alters Original
Simplifying the original text by
means of a few alterations and
omissions, he has facilitated transla
tion; his annotations avoid any
' rigid and dogmatic adherence to
either the direct or indirect method
of language teaching."
In the introduction, the keen an
alysis of German expression, and the
career and dramatic productions of
Unruh acquaint the reader with the
fascinating historical and literary
background of "Louis Ferdinand,"
and with some of the prominent
traits of German character.
Deviates from History
The environment and character of
Prinz Friedrich Ludwig's Christian
is a good background in the drama
matic account of the playwright's
own inner struggle between author
ity and freedom. The general uot
line of the drama deviates little from
the historical sources which show
Louis Ferdinand to be a fascinating
combination of artist and warrior,
although brave in war and peace, of
an unstable character.
The gigantic figure of Napoleon,
Prussia's arch-enemy, inspires Louis
Ferdinand to put personal initiative
and self-determination against pas
sive obedience to dull authority.
Although done for the sake of the
living ideal of Prussia, because he
acts autonomously, the prince be
comes guilty of the betrayal and
violation of the very same idea that
he wished to uphold. Since the law
of duty commands complete subor
dination of the individual, Louis
Ferdinand must pay the price of his
life to atone for his tragic guilt.
