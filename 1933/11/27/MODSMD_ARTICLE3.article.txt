# More French Cabinets
## 
### 
Over the week-end wine-loving
French Premier Sarraut's cabinet,
teetered, finally fell, French politics,,
in ferment all this year, have defi
nitely arrived at a crisis. To cope
with this crisis, President Lebrun
designated veteran Minister Camille
Chautemps as premier, placed for
midable task of forming cabinet in
his ample lap.
Last night proposed cabinet took
definite shape, will try to stand on
old reliable French policies of pro
tecting franc, fighting inflation,
guarding French security. Usually
such would be safe, but this is an
unusual situation, probably needs
unusual remedies (lower costs,
higher taxes, some inflation) all
anathema to French. Odds are
against long life for this one.
