lost its season ender to the Califor

Boars Lead 2-0 at Half
California piled up a 2 to 0 lead
at half time, as the Cardinal squad
failed to work together. The Golden
ones scored again early in the sec
ond half.
Regulars Dick Strouse, Rudy Gon
zales, and Sven Doddington gave
their place in the starting line-up
to a trio of substitutes for the first
few minutes of play, and the com
bination, which had clicked all sea
son, was broken up and failed to
function smoothly until late in the
game.
In spite of the loss, Stanford
won the Bear-Card series; Indian
soccermen won the other two con
tests, 1-0 and 3-1, respectively.
Saturday's tilt was not a confer
ence game.
Coach Harry Maloney started a
line-up consisting of Jack King,
goal keeper; Cyril Johnson, left
full; Rod Lewis, right full; Dave
Dunning, right half; John Moore,
center half; Waddy White, left half;
Captain Carl Knecht, outside left;
Mike Gomez, inside left; Doug Ken
nedy, inside right; Bud Ki'ebs, out
side right, and Art Hearn, center.
Substitutions Early
At the end of the half Strouse
went in at center half, Moore was
shifted to center forward, and Hearn
moved to inside right with Kennedy
leaving the game. Gonzales and
Doddington substituted for Dunning
and Krebs, respectively.
The playing of Strouse, Johnson,
King, and Knecht was good for Stan
ford. Rod Lewis, playing his first
game, looked fairly good. Maloney
characterized play of other team
members as "just mediocre."

fornia, San Francisco University
captured the conference title by de
feating San Jose State Teachers Col
lege, 2 to 0., Stanford ended the sea
