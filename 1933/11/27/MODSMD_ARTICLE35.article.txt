# Babes Fight To Scoreless Stalemate
## 
### 
Playing a ragged game, Stanford's
freshman soccer squad drew a 0-0
tic with the University of California
babes in the final engagement of the
season here Saturday morning.
The Cardinal first-year men con
tinually pounded the California goal,
and most of the game was played in
Bear terrtiory.
Coach Harry Maloney used a large
squad in order to give the substi
tutes a chance to earn their letters,
and regulars played only about half
of the game.
