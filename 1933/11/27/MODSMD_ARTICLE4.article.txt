### 
Staff Chief General Mac-Arthur
put on his most solemn expression,
warned U.S. that the Army's
strength was below the danger line,
hoped that this would be rectified
at once. Occasion for statement was
his annual report to War Secretary
Dorr. Recommendations are: up
ping of strength from 120,000 to 160,-
000, removal of 15 per cent pay cut,
two hundred million to be spent on
motorization, new planes, new guns.
Observers felt most of these to be
long overdue, badly needed, looked
across the big pond at militaristic
Europe, the other way at equally
nationalistic Japan.
