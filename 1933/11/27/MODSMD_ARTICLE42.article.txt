Scoring the winning goal in the
last minute of play, Stanford's polo
team defeated the powerful Castro
Valley quartet from San Mateo 11 to
10 -last Friday afternoon. Woody
Melone, veteran number three man,
tapped the final tally between the
posts, giving the Indians a victory
over their more experienced rivals. ;
Playing for Stanford were Captain
Luppe Luppen at number one,
Kemp Maer at two, Woody Melone
at three, and Bill Rogers at back.
Frank Burns also played a part of
the game at number two.
Castro 12-goal Team
The visiting quartet, older and
more experienced, carried an official
twelve - goal rating, while Captain
Gordan's charges were unofficially
rated at four goals. Partially com- i
pensating for this difference, a four- ]
goal starting advantage was given to
the Redshirts who found it just
enough for victory.
Well-mounted and smoothly play- !
ing, the San Mateo four consisted of
Bill Gilmore at one, Jack Bradley at
two, Will Tevis at three, and Frank
Fuller at back. Easily the best team
that Stanford has met this season, I
the visitors lived up to their ad
vance publicity by extending the
Redshirts to the limit.

The excellent showing made by
Stanford strengthens chances for a '
victory against Arizona Thursday
and Saturday of this week, since the (
Indians had had little opportunity |
to show what they could do until ;
last Friday's game.
Previous contests had resulted in
fairly easy victories for Stanford
over the Menlo Circus Club and the
Del Monte Polo Club.
Game to lougr<en Squad
Principal purpose of the San Ma
teo game was to give the Redshirts
a little stiff competition in prepara
tion for the University of Arizona
series at Tucson.
The team will leave tomorrow
night for the Wildcat games, one of
which will be played on Thanksgiv
ing Day and one on Saturday.
