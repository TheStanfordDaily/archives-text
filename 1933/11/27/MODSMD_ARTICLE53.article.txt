What happens when Stanford
rough meets hotcha celebrity? An
swer: A good time is had by all.
It seems that fan-waving Miss
Sally Rand, late of Chicago, visited
the campus last evening to witness
Gaieties, Loos' semi-fan dance, and
the Gaieties dance.
At 1:30 a.m. Sally and cohorts got
hamburger-starved and wandered
into Mac's Alley, all-night eat
"joint" in Palo Alto. Some 15 or so
roughs had similar ideas.
Good-naturedly Sally took the
razzing of the roughs, trading parry
for thrust: "Gome up and see me
some time." Don't worry, we will.
So you're 'Sally of our Alley'." "How
are the fans, Sally?" "If I never
have to wave another, it'll be too
soon."

On leaving, Sally autographed
everything from cuffs to handker
; chiefs, programs to napkins. "This
reminds me of the time I auto
graphed a ricksha boy's shorts at
the Fair."
"How'd you like our campus?"
1 "Oh, I loved it .... I had a mar
| velous time."
Left behind was the name "Sally
Rand" carefully carved on Mac's
1 much-mutilated wall.
Kiss-blowing and smiling, Sally
, was off to San Srancisco, with Mr.
and Mrs. Crompton Bangs, and her
j campus guides of the evening, her
two managers, behomothic Jim Hay,
her campus "date"â€”and a promise
j to root for Stanford in the Big Game
i on the morrow.
