Intramural football semi - finals
will be played this afternoon with
the four teams who won their games
last week in the playoffs, taking the
field.
Eight teams won their respective
leagues to participate in the play
offs which began Wednesday.
A.T.O. defeated El Campo by a
close 7 to G game; Ernie Arbuckle,
all-Stanford back field man, starred
in the game, recovering a fumbled
kick-off which finally resulted in a
touchdown and the winning con
version.
Sequoia I, who opposes A.T.O. to
morrow, reached the semi-finals
when Bill Ladue intercepted and
ran 60 yards for a touchdown against
Theta Chi. Ladue's sprints and kick
ing, accompanied by excellent block
ing on the part of the Sequoia
roughs, brought the team to its pres
ent place in competition.
Sigma Nu, which plays El Toro
tomorrow, has played a superior
j class of football during the season,
i and decisively defeated her play
! off contestant, Breakers, by a 21 to
j 6 score. Ted Leidig played an out
| standing game for Sigma Nu against
! the Breakers, as did James Mullen,
j Howard Buller, and Bud Shreve.
They are expected to furnish plenty
of trouble for the Toros in today's
game.
