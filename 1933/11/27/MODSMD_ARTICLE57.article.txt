came Southern Conference cham
pions, expressed hope of invitation
to come out to Pasadena.
Big Ten Leader
Northwestern fell before Michi
gan, 13-0, as the Wolverine jugger
naut clinched its four consecutive
Big Ten title. One tie mars this
candidate's season, and there is still
the Big Ten anti-post season inter
sect ional game ruling.
Ail-American Bill Corbus, acting
captain for the Big Game, attempted
to use his Trojan-beating toe in a
first quarter try for a field goal from
the 27-yard line, but the ball flew
wide.
Williams Place Kicks
The next quarter saw a long pass
gain put the Bears in place for a
similar scoring play, with Arleigh
Williams successfully splitting the
goal posts.
This put the superior ground
gaining Indians behind. Despite a
nice 25-yard run by Grayson to the
California 11, and a subsequent
goal-line pass to Hamilton, which
failed as an earlier one to Moscrip
had failed, it was nearly the middle
of the last quarter when the many
Stanford offensives culminated in a
touchdown.
Norgard Scores
At this time came the 55-yard
playâ€”a touchdown Alustiza-to-Nor
gard pass, and attendant run came
in. Directly following Corbus' con
version and kick-off, a determined
Bear team started going places.
With first down on Stanford 4-
yard stripe, the Blue and Gold was
thrice thwarted. On the last trial, a
pass intended for Stewart was speed
ily, and seemingly miraculously,
intercepted by Sophomore Hamilton,
who scampercd GO yards from the
goal to the Bear's 40.
The final gun followed soon, end
ing a spectacular Big Game with the
Indians on the top of the heap, and
clamoring for the Rose Bowl tussle.
