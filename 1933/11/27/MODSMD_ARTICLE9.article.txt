Poetry Writer Since Boyhood
Acclaimed by many as America's I
greatest living poet, Edv/in Mark- j
ham has written poetry since his j
; early boyhood, when he worked at j
i farming, blacksmithing, and herding
;in California. For 32 years he has
practiced poetry as an art and pro- j
fession, and in .recent years has giver* I.
addresses and readings of his works, i
! throughout America.
Of Mr. Markham's "Man With the
Hoe," "Who's Who in America"
says, "It is held by many as the bat
! tie cry of the next thousand years." |
He has been described by John j
Galsworthy as "a poet with a world I
vision—one who can live with j
Beauty, grieve with Sorrow, and
blow the bugle calls of Truth." To i
this John Haynes Holmes has added]
; the somewhat sweeping statement
that "Markham, standing on the;
summit of his 80 years, has the in- j
effable experience of looking toward !
a horizon already aglow with the'
light of his immortality."
