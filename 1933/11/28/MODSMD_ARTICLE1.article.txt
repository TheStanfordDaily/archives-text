## Stabilization

W.jII Street seems to have par
iially recovered from its care of in
flexion jitters, again looks at the
bright side. Developments of the
week serve to confirm the belief that
I'.R. s administration is keeping its
ears to the ground. Gold price held
(at $3.3.7(5) for a whole week, first
time* during gold buying, price-up
ping campaign.
Youngish, conservative Budget-
Director Douglas' speech in Boston
last week is supposed to have re
flected Government views, vastly
relieved worried financiers, bankers,
people generally. Reacting to this
news, dollar bounded upward on
foreign exchange, pound fell to
$5.06. Most encouraging sign was
substantial recovery of U.S. Govern
ment bonds. Reason: banks, insur
ance companies, trusts are buying
again—they sold last week.

F.R. still keeps an attentive eye
toward turbulent midwest, home of
strongest administration critics, tax
troubles, farm. Yesterday he heai-d
verbose, two-fisted radio-priester
Coughlin predict gold prices would
soar over $40 soon; his erstwhile
pal, A1 Smith, got a sound lambast
ing for denouncing gold program.
Inflation advocates have been
strangely quiet all week, will prob
ably open up soon. Wheat, cotton,
hogs failed to rise.
