# SORORITIES SEND TEA INVITATIONS
## 1933 Women's Rushing To Open December 6 
### 
Marking the opening of 1933
women's rushing, invitations were
early this morning distributed in all
new * women's living groups. The
teas are slated to begin on Wednes
day, December 6, continuing through
Sunday, December 10. Hours are
from 3 until 6 o'clock.
The influx of new women has
necessitated a departure from pre
cedent in the procedure of the fall
teas with which Stanford's nine so
rorities customarily begin rushing
hostilities.
Heretofore the invitations have
been t extended to all entering
women, but this year individual in
vitations are being sent out. Also,
unlike the practice of former years,
rushees are required to mail to the
sorority groups their definite ac
ceptance of specific dates for the
convenieme of entertaining Greek
houses.
Re-emphasizing the simplicity and
economy rnotif of this year's rush
ing seaso i, Mary Rath, Pan-Hellenic
head, last night reminded the Row

coffee oj tea is to be served at the
