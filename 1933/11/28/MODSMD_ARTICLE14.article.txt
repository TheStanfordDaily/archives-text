# MARKHAM WILL DISCUSS POEMS IN TALK TODAY
## Picturesque Old Poet To Read Poetry, Give Varied Talk 
### Will Williams 
Edwin Markham, one of the most
interesting personalities in Ameri
can literature, has announced for
his subject "Readings from My Own
Poems, with Glints of Gravity and
Gayety." Tonight's audience, which
will assemble in the Assembly Hall
at 7:30 o'clock, will listen to a man
whose vitality, enthusiasm, and great
humanity combine to make a plat
form presence that an audience
never forgets.
Displays Humor
This reporter was present at one
of Edwin Markham',s lectures two
years ago. The frock-coated, be
whiskered old poet, beloved by his
people, displayed a wit and humor
which kept his listeners laughing
throughout. In Markham's lectures
there is more gayety than gravity,
even though this one is to be glints
of both.
In the recital of his poems he is
dramatic and lyrical. His knowl
edge of literature is deep and his
lectures are brilliant. The world
knows him as the author of "The
Man With the Hoe," and of "Lin
coln, the Man of the People."
"Greatest Poet"
H. L. Mencken says that "The Man
With the Hoe" is the greatest poem
ever written in America.
Dr. Henry van Dyke said of "Lin
coln": "It is the greatest poem ever
written on the immortal martyr, and
the greatest that ever will be writ
ten."
Markham's long career as a poet
and a lecturer has seen him doing
many things since the day when he
was an obscure principal of public
schools thrust into prominence and
greatness with the publication of
"The Man With the Hoe" in 1899.
He was engaged for 12 years in se
lecting and editing "Remarkable
Pages from Thomas Lake Harris."
He whs the editor of "Foundation
Stones of Success," and he has writ
ten many books of criticism and
comment, including "The Hoe-Man
in the Making," a series of articles
on child-labor.
Gives Berkeley Lectures
A member of the American Acad
emy of Arts and Letters, and the
honorary president of the Poetry So
ciety of America, Markham is giving
a four-week series of lectures at
the Williams Institute of Berkeley,
through whose courtesy the pic
turesque, 81-year-old poet is to
speak to a Stanford audience.
He was raised in the Suisun Val
ley, and as a young man taught in
the Oakland and San Jose schools.
He has not been in California since
1926, his home being in New York.
Immediately after the lecture, an
informal reception will be held for
him in the Women's Clubhouse,
through the efforts of the Hospital
ity Committee of the Associated
Women Students. Students and fac
ulty are invited.
