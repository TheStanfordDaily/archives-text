## Rolph, Wilbur, Faculty, Give Varied Views 
### Charlotte Burridge 
While telegrams lauding his stand
I on the San Jose mob action were
j being received by Governor Rolph,
I bitter denouncement and firm up
j holding of the hanging clashed in
) campus opinions. The statements
j follow:
Governor James Rolph: "Why
I should I call out the troops to pro
j tect those fellows? This is the best
I lesson that California has ever given
, the country. We must show the
! country that the State is not going
jto tolerate kidnaping. They'll learn
| thev can't kidnap in this state,
j "They'll find out that they're not
safe even in our penitentiaries. I
am checking San Quentin and Fol
some prisons to find out what kid
napers they have. I am thinking of
paroling them to those fine patriotic
citizens of San Jose who know how
to handle such a situation. Their
I method is the best way to get rid of
| kidnapers."
i Dr. Kay Lyman Wilbur: "The mob
|is never right. Its actions come up
| out of the depths of savagery. It is
! the curse and shame of organized
! government that a civilized commu
j nity can have its name blackened
' by those who in the name of justice
brush aside the courts and kill."
"The lesson of the terrible murder
of Mr. Hart is plain, but to how
j many will it mean that just as honey
| brings in the flies, so do gambling,
j prostitution, and liquor bring in the
j criminals. Why not make this the
| occasion to clean up the general law
■ lessness of Santa Clara County?"
Romanic Languages Instructor Ida
Stauf: "I was delighted. I was never
so pleased in my life. I am very
1 strongly in favor of the lynching. I
don't think that destruction of the
legal system matters. After all there
is some justice." (Miss Stauf had her
students clap for one minute yester
day morning in honor of the "due
j justice rendered.") , w

Professor of History P. A. Martin:
I "It was utterly detestable and in
i every respect deplorable. I regard
| Governor Rolph's alleged statement
las extraordinarily unfortunate,
j There was no justification whatso
j ever."
—o —
Professor of History E. M. Hulme:
| "Theoretically I am against all
j lynching, but in this case I Ihink it
was justified. The less money spent
I on those cruel murderers the better,
j Moreover, I think that something
t like that was necessary to intimi
date other criminals who may be
] contemplating kidnaping."

Assistant Professor of Sociology
1 Richard LaPicre: "II is an indite-
I mcnt of our antiquated legal sys
: tcm."
Professor of Criminal Law C. G.
| Vernier: "I am absolutely opposed
ito lynching. There was no excuse
for it at ajl in this case. The men
! were arrested, apparently were to
j be tried fairly promptly, and a con
j vicfion seemed positive. It is simply
ja reversion to primitive maneuvers
i of taking the law in our hands."

Citizenship Instructor D. M. Bar
bour: "I don't think one can have
a great deal of sympathy for the vic
tims of the lynching. I do think it
somewhat of an inditement of Amer
ican court procedure. The important
part is that people don't have confi
dence in courts; confidence that they
will do justice."
