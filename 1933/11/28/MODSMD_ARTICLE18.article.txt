Enraged citizens' lives against the worthless existence of two confessed
cold-blooded murders!
i Sheriff William Emig and his deputies fought for a while to preserve
! the letter of law and order in San Jose Sunday night. Then, because
further resistance meant the lives of citizens, because (he odds were
finally overwhelmingly against him and his handful of deputies—because
; the defenders themselves were human, were descendants of early Califor
nia vigilantes, personally interested in swift justice—Emig and his dep
uties gave up their unwanted prisoners, were secretly glad that mob
violence had occurred.

j matters were getting out of hand.
Alarmed San Jose police sent out
| riot calls for help from gendarmes
I from neighboring cities.
Officers by Carloads
| San Francisco, Berkeley, Oakland,
I and Palo Alto responded. Officers
| poured into San Jose by the car
j loads. But it was too late. Emig
! and his deputies had waited too long
j and vigilante violence had already
i finished its main work.
From 9 until 11 o'clock tear gas
j kept the attackers at bay. Then the
j tear gas ran out. Meanwhile the
I county jail was wrecked. All the
| windows on the alley side of the
; courthouse were broken.
A deputy stuck his head out a
window—and said: "You can have
them in a minute, boys." An officer
we talked to said it was impossible
to get. near the men who actually
handled the ram which battered in
i the jail.
Deputy Broken Up
One deputy sheriff was consider
, ably broken up. "Aren't you human
' —you've killed them—" The crowd
growled, "THEY weren't human."
I "Well, you've done it now, go to
j your homes" —but spectators and
i those partaking passed him by.
i The bodies of the men were beaten
I a dull red. Cries of "burn him"
! went up as police cut down Holmes'
body—the staring white face was a
| frozen mask. The crowd milled with
| sadistic delight. It drew back for
: the hearse. "Make way for the rat's
body." Police were two deep around
I the car.
Everyone was certain it was a
good thing—would be a deterrent to
kidnaping in the future. Traffic
was halted for three blocks in all
directions. At 12:30 o'clock, the po
lice began to withdraw. Throughout
j they had been genial, saving their
| faces. No night sticks, all holsters
i buttoned.
Tear Gas Strong
We went down the alley to the
j jail. The tear gas was too strong to
permit staying there and we had to
j withdraw. Later on it was practically
impossible to find a telephone not
| in use.
I This was the first California lynch -
| ing of a white man since 1020, when
j three members of the Howard gang
were "strung up to a sour apple
! tree" in Santa Rosa. In San Jose,
iso far, no one is held for legal blame.
No action is being taken—probabil
ity is that none will be. People in
j general don't want to see anyone
blamed.
j Sheriff Emig and Jailer Howard
Buffiington are in the hospital to
' day with concussions suffered when
they resisted the mob. No other in
; juries were reported. No one in the
crowd was seriously hurt.
I Yesterday large crowds milled
j around the wreck of a jail. Most of
j them were curious. Many were
| souvenir hunters. Feeling is quiet
| ing down. The job is done, the mob
: has spent its strength. Eventually
| the crowds will dissipate.

Police Negligent *
Law and order were not preserved, j
The police were negligent. They
knew mob violence would again slur j
the records of justice in California '
if no preparations were made to i
prevent a lynching.
Yet no barricades were thrown up. j
The sheriff made no bold warning, j
he did not remove the prisoners'
when danger threatened. Only two
fire-hoses were in evidence. The of- i
ficers were genial, laughed and joked 1

! with members of the lynching party
j —many were openly sympathetic
j with the proceedings.
Judge Lynch beat John Law to the
! draw. A compai'atively cool and
calculating, if growling mob of 20,000
i fought through an alley flooded with
| tear gas. Four hours the milling
crowd stoned the antiquated jail
| with boulders ranging from one to
| six inches in diameter.
Readied Head at 11
Action culminated at 11 o'clock
j when a handful of Santa Clara stu
; dents, room-mates, buddies of mur
-1 dered Brooke Hart manned 15 foot,
| 8-inch pipes—used these as batter -
i ing rams, smashed the doors, broke
down the bars and gained entry to
i the old red brick bastile.
Holmes and Thurmond were then
dragged from their cells, beaten up
j incidentally along the way. Both
pleaded for mercy. The mob, at
| fever-pitch, dragged them out the
debris-strewn alley, across the street
into St. James Park with ropes al
ready around their necks. Limbs of
two spreading acacia trees were Ihe
j setting. "Cocky Jack" Holmes and
whining Thomas Thurmond swiftly,
cringingly, paid their debt to the
I mob.
Become Bestial
The motley crowd, until now well
under control, considering their pur
pose, suddenly became bestial—
both men were denuded except for
short sweaters, and left to swing
Ighastily beneath the distant, eerie
Ipark lights, the target of nothing
more serious than flash-bulbs of
J energetic photographers.
At 1 o'clock Sunday afternoon,
| two hours after the finding of Hart's
body, muttering threats began rising
from the rapidly growing crowd.
San Jose's meagre force of 50 offi
cers held them off until around 4
o'clock. The crowd subsided for a
time.
Things were relatively quiet un
til 7 o'clock when feeling began
running high again. By 9 o'clock

Enraged citizens' lives against the worthless existence of two confessed
cold-blooded murders!
i Sheriff William Emig and his deputies fought for a while to preserve
! the letter of law and order in San Jose Sunday night. Then, because
further resistance meant the lives of citizens, because (he odds were
finally overwhelmingly against him and his handful of deputies—because
; the defenders themselves were human, were descendants of early Califor
nia vigilantes, personally interested in swift justice—Emig and his dep
uties gave up their unwanted prisoners, were secretly glad that mob
violence had occurred.

j matters were getting out of hand.
Alarmed San Jose police sent out
| riot calls for help from gendarmes
I from neighboring cities.
Officers by Carloads
| San Francisco, Berkeley, Oakland,
I and Palo Alto responded. Officers
| poured into San Jose by the car
j loads. But it was too late. Emig
! and his deputies had waited too long
j and vigilante violence had already
i finished its main work.
From 9 until 11 o'clock tear gas
j kept the attackers at bay. Then the
j tear gas ran out. Meanwhile the
I county jail was wrecked. All the
| windows on the alley side of the
; courthouse were broken.
A deputy stuck his head out a
window—and said: "You can have
them in a minute, boys." An officer
we talked to said it was impossible
to get. near the men who actually
handled the ram which battered in
i the jail.
Deputy Broken Up
One deputy sheriff was consider
, ably broken up. "Aren't you human
' —you've killed them—" The crowd
growled, "THEY weren't human."
I "Well, you've done it now, go to
j your homes" —but spectators and
i those partaking passed him by.
i The bodies of the men were beaten
I a dull red. Cries of "burn him"
! went up as police cut down Holmes'
body—the staring white face was a
| frozen mask. The crowd milled with
| sadistic delight. It drew back for
: the hearse. "Make way for the rat's
body." Police were two deep around
I the car.
Everyone was certain it was a
good thing—would be a deterrent to
kidnaping in the future. Traffic
was halted for three blocks in all
directions. At 12:30 o'clock, the po
lice began to withdraw. Throughout
j they had been genial, saving their
| faces. No night sticks, all holsters
i buttoned.
Tear Gas Strong
We went down the alley to the
j jail. The tear gas was too strong to
permit staying there and we had to
j withdraw. Later on it was practically
impossible to find a telephone not
| in use.
I This was the first California lynch -
| ing of a white man since 1020, when
j three members of the Howard gang
were "strung up to a sour apple
! tree" in Santa Rosa. In San Jose,
iso far, no one is held for legal blame.
No action is being taken—probabil
ity is that none will be. People in
j general don't want to see anyone
blamed.
j Sheriff Emig and Jailer Howard
Buffiington are in the hospital to
' day with concussions suffered when
they resisted the mob. No other in
; juries were reported. No one in the
crowd was seriously hurt.
I Yesterday large crowds milled
j around the wreck of a jail. Most of
j them were curious. Many were
| souvenir hunters. Feeling is quiet
| ing down. The job is done, the mob
: has spent its strength. Eventually
| the crowds will dissipate.

Police Negligent *
Law and order were not preserved, j
The police were negligent. They
knew mob violence would again slur j
the records of justice in California '
if no preparations were made to i
prevent a lynching.
Yet no barricades were thrown up. j
The sheriff made no bold warning, j
he did not remove the prisoners'
when danger threatened. Only two
fire-hoses were in evidence. The of- i
ficers were genial, laughed and joked 1

! with members of the lynching party
j —many were openly sympathetic
j with the proceedings.
Judge Lynch beat John Law to the
! draw. A compai'atively cool and
calculating, if growling mob of 20,000
i fought through an alley flooded with
| tear gas. Four hours the milling
crowd stoned the antiquated jail
| with boulders ranging from one to
| six inches in diameter.
Readied Head at 11
Action culminated at 11 o'clock
j when a handful of Santa Clara stu
; dents, room-mates, buddies of mur
-1 dered Brooke Hart manned 15 foot,
| 8-inch pipes—used these as batter -
i ing rams, smashed the doors, broke
down the bars and gained entry to
i the old red brick bastile.
Holmes and Thurmond were then
dragged from their cells, beaten up
j incidentally along the way. Both
pleaded for mercy. The mob, at
| fever-pitch, dragged them out the
debris-strewn alley, across the street
into St. James Park with ropes al
ready around their necks. Limbs of
two spreading acacia trees were Ihe
j setting. "Cocky Jack" Holmes and
whining Thomas Thurmond swiftly,
cringingly, paid their debt to the
I mob.
Become Bestial
The motley crowd, until now well
under control, considering their pur
pose, suddenly became bestial—
both men were denuded except for
short sweaters, and left to swing
Ighastily beneath the distant, eerie
Ipark lights, the target of nothing

Enraged citizens' lives against the worthless existence of two confessed

i Sheriff William Emig and his deputies fought for a while to preserve
! the letter of law and order in San Jose Sunday night. Then, because
further resistance meant the lives of citizens, because (he odds were
finally overwhelmingly against him and his handful of deputies—because
; the defenders themselves were human, were descendants of early Califor
nia vigilantes, personally interested in swift justice—Emig and his dep
uties gave up their unwanted prisoners, were secretly glad that mob
violence had occurred.

j matters were getting out of hand.
Alarmed San Jose police sent out
| riot calls for help from gendarmes
I from neighboring cities.
Officers by Carloads
| San Francisco, Berkeley, Oakland,
I and Palo Alto responded. Officers
| poured into San Jose by the car
j loads. But it was too late. Emig
! and his deputies had waited too long
j and vigilante violence had already
i finished its main work.
From 9 until 11 o'clock tear gas
j kept the attackers at bay. Then the
j tear gas ran out. Meanwhile the
I county jail was wrecked. All the
| windows on the alley side of the
; courthouse were broken.
A deputy stuck his head out a
window—and said: "You can have
them in a minute, boys." An officer
we talked to said it was impossible
to get. near the men who actually
handled the ram which battered in
i the jail.
Deputy Broken Up
One deputy sheriff was consider
, ably broken up. "Aren't you human
' —you've killed them—" The crowd
growled, "THEY weren't human."
I "Well, you've done it now, go to
j your homes" —but spectators and
i those partaking passed him by.
i The bodies of the men were beaten
I a dull red. Cries of "burn him"
! went up as police cut down Holmes'
body—the staring white face was a
| frozen mask. The crowd milled with
| sadistic delight. It drew back for
: the hearse. "Make way for the rat's
body." Police were two deep around
I the car.
Everyone was certain it was a
good thing—would be a deterrent to
kidnaping in the future. Traffic
was halted for three blocks in all
directions. At 12:30 o'clock, the po
lice began to withdraw. Throughout
j they had been genial, saving their
| faces. No night sticks, all holsters
i buttoned.
Tear Gas Strong
We went down the alley to the
j jail. The tear gas was too strong to
permit staying there and we had to
j withdraw. Later on it was practically
impossible to find a telephone not
| in use.
I This was the first California lynch -
| ing of a white man since 1020, when
j three members of the Howard gang
were "strung up to a sour apple
! tree" in Santa Rosa. In San Jose,
iso far, no one is held for legal blame.
No action is being taken—probabil
ity is that none will be. People in
j general don't want to see anyone
blamed.
j Sheriff Emig and Jailer Howard

' day with concussions suffered when
they resisted the mob. No other in

crowd was seriously hurt.
I Yesterday large crowds milled
j around the wreck of a jail. Most of

down the bars and gained entry to

Holmes and Thurmond were then

pleaded for mercy. The mob, at
