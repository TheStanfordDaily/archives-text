# Princeton Awaits Formal Bowl Invitation
## 
### 
Princeton University will not con
sider meeting Stanford in the Los
Angeles coliseum for the annual
Rose Bowl classic on New Year's
Day until the Coast champs extend
a formal invitation to the unbeaten
Tigers, stated Asa Bushnell, Prince
ton's graduate manager of athletic
today.
On the face of it the announce
ment is to show Princeton's uncon
cern over the opportunity of meet
ing the Indians, but actually it
indicates that the Eastern school is
leaving the matter open for Stan
ford initiative.
