# Can Rolph Be Our Governor?

### 
Those llial have lon# looked upon Governor .Tames
H<> 11>11 Jr. as an innocent joke, now are convinced that lie
is,definitely impossible, an insulting excuse for a Governor
of Hie Slate of California.
The Governor has nol only sanctioned a crime, hut lie.
encourages more of them. His brazen barbarism does not
even stop here. He floats over the fact that bv postponing
his trip lo Idaho, he prevented the sending of troops that
could have slopped the mob-killing. And Ihen he caps hi?;
almost unbelievable altitude with a chuckling thought that
now kidnappers will realize that they are not safe even in
penitentiaries. His Honor even regrets that he cannot
turn over other kidnappers to the San .lose mob for brutal
killing.
To have such opinions aired by ignorant bums on street
corners is revolting enough; but to have them come from
(he Chief Executive of our State is nothing short of unbe
lievable. That Rolph is just playing up to what he thinks
is the majority is almost 100 obvious to mention. Hut even
the crudities of modern politics have their limits.
We have stomached Rolph in his eternal kissing of
County Fair Queens, his milking of cows, and his airplane
excursions from one center of votes to the next. It was
even something of a gav picture: the government rolling
along in much the same irregular fashion whether its nom
inal head was lumbering up and down the Capitol corri
dor's or whether he was not.
Rut these statements on the San .lose killings are be
yond the realm of possible humor unless one can laugh at
the pitiful. There is our chosen leader who has sworn to
uphold law and order. There he sils in Sacramento not
only failing to uphold law and order by sending guards
men to the rioting, but definitely placing himself before
the people as in favor of mob violence.
There will be lynchings in the future. There may be
innocent men killed. Governor Rolph can praise himself
for having aided in the backward march to frontier society.
The brutal mob is at best only barely held in check.
Law must wage a continuous battle to win over lawless
ness. What power can the law have when the biggest offi
cer in the state openly takes the side of lawlessness and
against law enforcement?
The bestiality of the mob was shocking. Their bestial
ity is exceeded by the Governor. They acted in mob rage,
lie acted in private meditation. The mob has no responsi
bility. The Governor has the responsibility of the whole
state.
Xow, the deep disgrace U> California is made indelible.
