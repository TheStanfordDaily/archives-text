Although many faculty members arc likely to object,
the administration could make a big hit with students if
it would extend the Christmas vacation two days, or a!
least raise the bars for that long on late registration fines,
in order to permit rooters at the Pasadena Rose Howl game
to enjoy their visit and return to the campus in a refresh
ened condition.
The strain of watchiijg an intersectional clash of such
prominence, coupled with the need of driving all night in
order to arrive at the Farm on schedule, would leave the
students in poor physical condition to open the winter
quarter. At any rale, classes will lie disrupted for those
two days.
The boon may seem slight, but nevertheless facts are
