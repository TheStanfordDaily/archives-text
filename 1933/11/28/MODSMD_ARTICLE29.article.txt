# Practical vs. Picturesque

Tll e only thing we don't like about the Lindbergh fam
ily is thai all this flying to every part of (he world is taking
;i good deal of the romance away from foreign spots.
Lindy, alone or with his wife, has flown casually, easily,
and quickly to almost every continent and to most of the
countries of the world. Europe, Asia, Central and South
America, and soon Africa will have felt the shadow of his
competent wings.
This may be all very well as far as air navigation goes,
and it may prove that Lindbergh and the airplane are both
wonderful, but we still can't help feeling a little irritated
to find that his conquests have made heretofore intriguing
places seem much less interesting.
Iceland is no longer a mysteriously distant place now
that Lindbergh has flown there in a few hours. Shanghai
is much less alluring since* he flew over it and landed his
plane in the formerly exciting Whangpoo River. Portugal
is no longer worth going to as a quaint little kingdom now
that its inhabitants have given Lindbergh a New Yorker
ish confetti-throwing reception. Soon he will have flown
over, and for travel purposes practically spoiled, the mys
terious plains of central Morocco and the exciting African
Cold Coast.
About all we have left are Tibet and Borneo. If he goes
there, we are liable to have a spiteful daydream in which
we sec him being chased by either the devil-worshippers
or the head-hunters.
