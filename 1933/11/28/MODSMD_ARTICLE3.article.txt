It is a possibility that Handsime
Adoli has bitten off a bit more pan
his pre-molars can manage. Rev.
Friedrich von Bodelschwingk, a
tower of strength in the Protestant
Church, resists the idea of the "Ger
man Christians" in basing religion
on force and not love.
He wrote Reichbishop Ludwig
Mueller protesting against the idea
that 75 per ccnt of all offices in the
el.arch be allotted lo German Chris
tians. Four thousand young clery-
have organized in protect
against antisemiticism as against
against the teachings of Christ.
All these men voted "Ja" in rec
ognition of the government's delving
into every other phase of controll
ing human actions but they balk
here.
