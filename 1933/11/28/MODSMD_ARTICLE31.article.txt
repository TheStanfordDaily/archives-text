ON SONG PLUGGING
Tin Pan Alley has been bemoan
ing loudly and vehemently of late
the fact that it is slowly strangling
to death, that its denizens are no '
longer, able to make a small fortune
by giving birth to 32 bars of sac
charine but humable music.
Undoubtedly there is much truth
in this complaint. Where, in the !
fabulous twenties, a No. 1 hit would
sell over a million copies in sheet
music and several hundred thousand
phonograph records, today its popu
larity is chiefly spent upon that new
bugbear, the radio, which, in com
parison, nets the composer a mere
pittance for his efforts.
The Alley makes its mistake, how
ever, in sitting back and blaming
the irresistible trend toward bigger
and better broadcasting, without
looking around to see if it can do
anything about the situation. If it
ever did chance to look beyond its
own pocketbook it might discover
the interesting fact that today's pop
ular song is worked so hard in such
a short time that it hasn't a chance
to gain any semblance of lasting i
success.
Variety is a necessary element in 1
recreation. Any psychologist will 1
tell you that no matter how good
an artistic expeiience is, if you have
to undergo it 20 times a day you
will soon tire of it. Not even the
best of Beethoven can pass a test
like that. Yet if a song happens to
strike the public fancy it is seized
with avidity by every crooner, or
chestra leader, radio producer, pho- !
nograph company, et al., in the land,'
and we, the poor victims, are bom- i
barded with it from all sides until
we cry for mercy. Of course no song
can stand up under such treatment.
A recent case in point is "The Last
Roundup." There is a song far above
the average, with much of the;
warmth and human feeling that is \
making "Old Man River" an Amer
ican classic. But now, a scant three
months after Joe Morrison first made
a hit singing it, masters of cere
monies are jokingly saying: "Ladies,
and gentlemen, as a special treat :
Fred Blatt and his orchestra will not
play "The Last Roundup." A great i
pity.
If composers would only mix a
little common sense with courage
and refuse to allow their brain chil
dren to be so woefully mishandled,
they would get greater returns in
the long run through more lasting
popularity, and many a meritorious J
song would be saved from a pre- j
mature grave. â€”Dahl ]
