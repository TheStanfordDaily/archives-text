# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
In a mad swirl of giddy human
emotions and frail human conven
tions, Santa Clara County has been
dragged through the muddiest depths
of earthly activity.
Still somewhat dazed and pale as
a result of the kidnap-murder of
young Brooke Hart, the gasping
community is served up with a
double-header. Yet strangely, every
one is not shocked at this dual mur
der; there have actually been cheers
for the murderers.
For years, we, north of the Mason
and Dixon line, have passed hur
riedly over press notices of negro
lynchings in the South. Down South,
so the popular attitude went, they
were ignorant, uneducated, were
faced with "their own peculiar prob
lem." Whatever excuse there ever
existed for indifference, it is now
gone. The malignancy is spreading,
has already crossed lines of longi
tude and color.
No one there is who- does not
sympathize with the family of the
slain boy. The Holmes-Thurmond
brutality was a crime against "pub
lic morals," but more so it was a
personal assault on the Hart family.
And so we are sorry.
But what of the lynchers? They
have committed a crime against civ
ilization. They have established

MILLIONS FOR MURDER

| adrenalin as the life blood of so
j ciety. They have suddenly denied
that the tribunal of reason is to be
the guide of the world. As long as
1 lynchers ..ire allowed to escape trial,
to escape punishment, the whole
! performance of government becomes
! a hopeless farce.
And what of our public officials?
'In the narrow view they have been
1 false to the "sacred" duty of their
offices. With eyes on the ballot box
and ears to the ground, they have
blandly seen crime committed, heard
appeals for justice, been stubbornly
' deaf to those cries.
j In the larger sense they have
| proved traitors to the en
tire social structure. If "your peo
ple is a beast," officialdom has shown
itself to be one of the worst working
parts of that monster. What can one
j think of official intellect when the
"humane" governor of the state ex
claims that he would gladly pardon
the lynching party, and earlier re
fused to send the troops which could
'have prevented the St. James Park
| massacre?
j If lynching is condoned, then kid
] napping must be condoned. Both
are manifestations of lawlessness—
! one on the part of a mob, the other
jon the part of the few. One is as
j horrible as the other.

In this whole bloody business the
j great tragedy is not the death of
Brooke Hart (though that is ter
rible), nor the murder of Holmes
, and Thurmond (though that is an
international disgrace). The great
tragedy is the American tragedy:
the complacency of the people in
refusing to resist organized law
lessness. —Dave Mellinkoff

In a mad swirl of giddy human
emotions and frail human conven
tions, Santa Clara County has been
dragged through the muddiest depths
of earthly activity.
Still somewhat dazed and pale as
a result of the kidnap-murder of
young Brooke Hart, the gasping
community is served up with a
double-header. Yet strangely, every
one is not shocked at this dual mur
der; there have actually been cheers
for the murderers.
For years, we, north of the Mason

lynchings in the South. Down South,

were ignorant, uneducated, were
faced with "their own peculiar prob
lem." Whatever excuse there ever
existed for indifference, it is now
gone. The malignancy is spreading,
has already crossed lines of longi
tude and color.
No one there is who- does not
sympathize with the family of the
slain boy. The Holmes-Thurmond
brutality was a crime against "pub
lic morals," but more so it was a
personal assault on the Hart family.
And so we are sorry.
