Columbia presents a program to
night at 6 o'clock over KFRC which
begins a new era in the world of
radio entertainment. The airing
brings the Philadelphia Symphony
to the lovers of classical music for
a nightly 15-minute period, this
being the first time a symphony or
chestra has ever attempted to give
the radio public a short, regularly
scheduled program. The presenta
tion will consist of excerpts from
"Parsifal" by Wagner. Another new
program is presented by CBS for
the lovers of jazz when Glen Gray
and his Casa Loma orchestra begin
a new commercial program. The
Casa Loma organization is the only
orchestra of the day which is a real
corporation, with a president and
secretary. Gray is not actually the
leader of the orchestra but is the
president of the Casa Loma Cor
poration and thus receives all of the
publicity. One of the miracles of
the radio world in recent years i.s
the rise of this organization from
obscurity to the distinction of
one of the finest dance bands in the
world.
Lacking paper, Victor Herbert
many times had to write his music
