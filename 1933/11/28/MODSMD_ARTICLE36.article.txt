## INDIAN PUZZLED OVER ROSE BOWL TEAMS 
### 
The Stanford Cardinals have cli
maxed a brilliant season'with a bid
to the Pasadena Rose Bowl game,
and now a new season begins for
Stanfordâ€”the season for picking a
suitable opponent to represent the
East. It promises to be fully as
studded with deadfalls and damna
tion as the season just completed.
Stanford has sole rights regarding
Ihe choice of their Eastern guest,
and the choice resolves itself into
considerable of a problem. Remem
ber what condemnation U.S.C. re
ceived last year for not inviting
Michigan? And Andy Kerr's famous
quotation concerning Colgate: "Un
beaten, untied, unseored on, and
uninvited!"
Regardless of what team eventu
ally gets the game, Stanford authori
ties will undergo a gauntlet of
criticism.
