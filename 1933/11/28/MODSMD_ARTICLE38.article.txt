# MICHIGAN PLAYS HARD SCHEDULE
## 
### 
Where Princeton and Army have
played at most one or two grade
teams, Michigan has taken on at
lsast five, and escaped unscathed,
except for a tie with Minnesota.
There are bars against all three
teams obtaining permission to make
the trip, although in view of the
good gate receipts and the accruing
prestige, all three could arrange it,
if invited.
Without a doubt, youthful Harry
Kipke's Michigan crew would play
the best brand of football, and would
have the best chance of winning.
They have a great line, with Willis
Ward, the negro trackman, and Pe
tosky, all-American from last year,
at ends. Their center, Bernard, will
probably be ail-American this year.
Bill Reiiner and Captain Fay are
nlfghly sweet backs. In fact, Michi
gan may be even a bit too good for
Stanford.
Army is an unknown quantity;
Princeton is reputed to be eager to
come. Whichever of the three makes
the trip, it is certain to be a great
l amo, loaded with interest and color.
