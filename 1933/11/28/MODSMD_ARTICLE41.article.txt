j orations, will be lost, as will Ernie
; Caddel, who alone scored 16 of i
Stanford's 25 points against the
! Southern California All-Stars last
| year.
A number of promising men from
j other sports turned out. They in
cluded Oscar Baer, slugging middle
weight from the boxing , team; Joe
' Vigna and Jack Walton from the'
freshman football team; Carl Knecht,
Rod Lewis, Dipk Strouse, Waddy j

nedy, Johnny Hitchcock, and Ber-,
nie Kaufman from the soccer squad;
Milt Keller and Ray Lewis from the i

Jim Wylie Coaches j
With Jim Wylie, one-time Aus- '
tralian All-Black star, coaching the
scrum and Dink Templeton, former
Stanford and American Olympic
ace, tutoring the backs, practice
went ahead rapidly and the after
noon was topped by a scrimmage.
The Stanford team will meet with
California sometime in December as
a tryout preliminary to picking a
squad to make the Canadian tour.

Of the Big Game, Brick Morse
writes, "It was the best played game
the Coast has seen this year. Without
Norgard in there for Stanford ....
the score .... 10-0 for California." i
