# LEATHER PUSHERS MEET TOMORROW IN PRELIMINARIES
## 
### 
Twenty - eight determined ama
teur boxers will fight this afternoon
at 4:15 o'clock in the Enema gym
nasium for the privilege of entering
the final rounds of the all-Univer
sity Tournament which will be held
December 5 under the auspices of
the Circle S Society. Competition
will take place in the featherweight,
lightweight, welterweight, and jun
ior-middleweight divisions. There
will be no preliminaries in the other
three classes as there are not enough
fighters signed up.
Today's competition will eliminate
all but four men in each class in
order that next week's program can
be limited to three bouts in each
division. Unless there is another
entrant in the bantamweight class
there will be no contest in this
weight as only one 118-pounder has
signed at this time.
This year's amateurs are more
evenly matched than usual and to
day's preliminaries should be hard
fought, according to boxing Coach
Myron Schall. The stiffest compe
tition is expected in the lightweight
and welterweight divisions where
several promising new leather push
ers are contending for a place in
the finals.
Stennet Sheppard and Ralph ,
Purdy are both given a good chance ,
to take the featherweight title but
they will find plenty of competition
in this class. Cabby Caballero is a
hard-driving fighter and John Sea-
man, a cross-country man, should
have a good chance. Other fighters
who are likely to surprise in this
weight are Don Brown and Paul
Cain.
In the lightweight class, Frank
Bowles and Walt Breed are perhaps
the outstanding contenders. Tom
Boothe, Ham Lawrence, Leroy Don
ahue, and Harold Fowler will fur
nish these boys with tough oppo
sition.
Bill Sullivan, a hard-hitting boxer
with some previous experience, is
the outstanding welterweight con
tender. Randy Hill and Joe Rea are
also given a good chance. Other
welterweights are: Ralph Frates, Al
Favour, Marion Stekoll, Dick Stark,

Bill Nickinovich, and David Whar
ton.
Colin McCorriston is favored to
give the junior-heavyweight con
tenders a hard fight for the title.
Pierce McDowell and Dick Van
Wagenen are also showing well in
this division. Torn Morrow, Rod
McLin, Jess Ray, and Cedric Thorn
ton complete the list of entries in
this weight.
