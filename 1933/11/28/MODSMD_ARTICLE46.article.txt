# POLO UPSET SEEN AS INDIANS LEAVE TO MEET ARIZONA
## 
### 
With the best chance in years to
upset one of the University of Ari
zona's great quartets, Stanford's
poloists will leave tonight for Tuscon
where they will take on the Wildcat
riders in a two-game Thanksgiving
series.
Arizona annually produces a polo
team that ranks with the best col
legiate quartets in the nation and
that has consistently trounced all its
Western rivals. This year, however,
although the Wildcats are practi
cally as strong as usual, an im
proved Indian team is rated as quite
capable of winning the series.
In the second oi' last year's two
series, Stanford succeeded in tying
the Arizonans in one game, although
the Wildcats took the second by a
decisive margin. In the earlier of
last year's series, the Indians won
one game with the aid of a handi
cap. Thursday's and Saturday's
contests will be played on an even
basis, however.
Men who will make the trip are
Captain Luppe Luppen, Woody Me
lone, Frank Burns, Kemp Maer, and
Bill Rogers. With the polo squad's
athletic appropriation dropped this
year, Captain Gordan, popular Red
shirt coach, will not make the trip,
trusting that his smooth-playing
charges can work out their own sal
vation.
