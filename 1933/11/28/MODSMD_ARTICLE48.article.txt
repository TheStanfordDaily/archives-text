### 
A large collection of oil paintings
by the "Women Painters of the
West," an association with head
quarters in Los Angeles, is now on
exhibition at the Stanford Art Gal
lery.
The interest that the exhibition
holds is augmented by the variety
of individual expression shown by
30 of the members of the associa
tion.
There are 35 paintings including
landscapes, marines, portraits, and
still life. Among the subjects are,
"Logger's Retreat," "Evening on the
Desert," "At Anchor," "Chinese
Girl," and "Sunflower."
The exhibition will continue un
til December 15th. The Gallery is
open free to the public from 10 a.m.
until 5 p.m.
