YESTERDAY'S RESULTS
A.T.0., 7; Sequoia I, 0.
Sigma Nu, fi; EI Toro, 0.
A pass snatched from the hands of
Sequoia's Bill Ladue by Ernie Ar
buckle of A.T.O. afforded the latter
their chance .to score in the semi
final intramural football game yes
terday afternoon.
Arbuckle received the pass on the
45-yard line by leaping high into
the air, with Ladue trying futilely to
knock it down. On the following
play Arbuckle took the ball, reÂ«-
versed it to Raymond Forsythe who
then threw it to Louis Phelps, run
ning'for the touchdown. Extra point
was scored with a pass from For
sythe to Arbuckle.
Sigma Nu degeated El Toro on
the freshman football field yester
day with one touchdown. The first
half was scoreless with Toro putting
her opponents well back in their
territory by receiving and kicking
back over the defenders' heads. Sig
ma Nu pushed down the field with
strong line plunges and passes but
was repulsed on the 10-yard line,
Bill Morse and Will Eisner doing
the best defensive work.
The winning six points were made
following another power drive by
Sigma Nu with a short pass from
Bud Shreve to Ted Leidig. Kick for
the conversion went wide.
A last minute comeback by Toro
gained 50 yards, but failed to score.
Final play between Sigma Nu and
A.T.O. will be held next Wednesday.
