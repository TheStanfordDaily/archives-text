Assistant Registrar C. G. Wrenn,
who is local vocational guidance di
rector, will be absent from his du
ties until December 11, taking a two
weeks' vacation because of poor
health.
Dr. Wrenn, who spoke yesterday
before the Sonoma county institute
at Santa Rosa, will probably take a
short trip before returning to the
campus and his- work on Decem
ber 11.

Dormitories at Lawrence College,
Appleton, Wis., are providing diet
tables for plump coeds. First they
.swallow little brown pills issued at
the infirmary and then sit down to
what they term a "blind" diet.
