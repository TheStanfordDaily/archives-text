# VON KUHLMANN AIRS VIEWS ON NAZI-GERMANY
## Teuton Diplomat Sees Hope For German Recovery Under Hitler 
### 
Stanford's drafty Assembly Hall, j
quite recovered from its dose of Big j
Game Gaieties, was filled again yes- j
terday to hear Dr. Richard von j
Kuhlmann, former German Foreign i
Minister, declaim solemnly, artfully
on the present world position of
Nazi Germany.
In distinct and distinctive English,
the veteran diplomat repainted the
picture of the Franco-German feud,
satirized over-fortified France, mini
mized actual difficulties between the
two nations.
Ridicule French
Heavy fingers clutching at the air,
von Kuhlman ridiculed the French
demand for "security." He declared
that it has always been France's
policy to see a weak, disunited Ger
many; his analysis here was objec
tive; he realized the basis of French
reasoning: Germany represents the
only possible war-threat to an other
wise geographically isolated unit.
Admittedly not a Nazi, von Kuhl
mann praised the manner in which
Adolf Hitler is managing German
foreign affairs. He took time out to
mention that the Chancellor had
come into power in the most parlia
mentary manner, neglected to say
whether or not he had continued in
office in this same parliamentary
vein.
Sees Hope in Present
The present situation, as von
Kuhlmann saw it, is hopeful. His
bases for this opinion: (I) the fact
j that Belgium had reopened seaport
I of Antwerp to German river traffic;
(2) the fact that cultural exchange
between France and Germany has
been reinstated, and (3) the fact
that dispatches indicate Hitler will
j now deal personally with represen
' tatives of t}ie French Republic.
