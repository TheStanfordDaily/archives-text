# Bob Cathcart Gets Decision In Moot Trial
## Right of Highest Bidder Argued at Court 
### Jay Graves 
Because he drove his points across I
forcefully, because he answered the j
questions put by the court with l
greater ingenuity than his opponent, i
Bob Cathcart won his case last night i
in the Stanford School of Law mootj
court.
He nosed out Gil Carr in a case j
involving the right of a highest bid- i
der at an action. Ho successfully I
showed, so far as his personal win
ning of moot court honors was con- '
coined, that an advertisement to .sell I
at auction implies that the sale is j
"without reserve." This means that j
goods once placed for sale cannot be '
withdrawn by the auctioneer.
Law Different
Cathcart won notwithstanding the
fact that Judge Harry Rathbun's,
decision on the law of the case was
for the other side. Rathbun, Stan
ford law professor, ruled on the
basis of precedent that in order for
that meaning to hold, the specific
words must be included.
Cathcart now advances to the sec
ond round of moot court. His next
case will be argued sometime during
winter quarter.
Postpone Other Trial
The other moot court case an
] nounced for last night was post
| poned until next week, pending the
[recovery of Judge Starley Morrison,
| who is ill at present.
It will be argued by Wally Craig
| and Hal Riede against Ray brothers,
! Phil and Will. The case is on a
J question involving municipal corpo-
I rations.
