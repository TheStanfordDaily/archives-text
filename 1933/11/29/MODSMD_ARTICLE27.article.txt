# Princeton Will Not Play in Rose Bowl; Yale Contract Cited
## Tiger Withdrawal Leaves Michigan, Duke, And Army Favored 
### 
Upsetting all unofficial conjec
tures to the eastern Rose Bowl rep
resentative, the Princeton Board of
Control definitely announced yes
terday that the undefeated Tigers
would not be available for the New
Year's Day game with Stanford.
Cited by the Board as the reason
for its action was the clause of the
Yale-Princeton football agreement
of 3927, which forbids the playing
of post-season games by either of
the contracting universities. Since
Princeton authorities had intimated
Monday that they would consider an
invitation to play, yesterday's an
nouncement threw a doubly-unex
pected bombshell into the much
publicized Rose Bowl situation.
Board Reaffirms Policy
Reaffirming its already - existing
policy, the Princeton Board stated
that "A prolongation of the Prince
ton football season beyond its nor
mal limits would not be for the best
interests of the players or the sport
at Princeton."
Elimination of Princeton from con
sideration narrows the field down to
Army, Michigan, and Duke as most
probable choices for the eastern
Rose Bowl representative. Michi
gan's season was completed last Sat
urday with a 13 to 0 victory over
Northwestern, giving the Wolverines
their fourth consecutive Big Ten
championship.
Army Meets Ramblers
Army has yet to get past the
much-defeated Notre Dame Ram
blers and it is not at all impossible
that the South Bend men will ap
proach their former great heights
j and down the unbeaten Cadets.
Duke has yet to face Georgia Tech,
j a potentially strong team that may
.spring an upset. The Blue Devils of
Duke are coached by Wallace Wade
1 whose Alabama team ran up an im
pressive Rose Bowl record that in
-1 eluded victories over Washington
j and Washington State and a 7-7 tie
with Stanford.
With A1 Masters in Pasadena ar
ranging details of the New Year's
i game, final decision as to the eastern
' opponent will in all probability
! be withheld until after next Satur
i day.
