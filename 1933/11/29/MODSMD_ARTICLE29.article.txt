# PERSONALITY OF POET MARKHAM WINS AUDIENCE
## Reminiscences of Colorful Writer Delight Large Group of Listeners RECITES MAN WITH HOE Speaker Sells Autographed Books of Poems 
### Will Williams 
Pausing dramatically for 10 sec
onds before opening his lecture, Ed
win Markham, America's greatest
living poet, chewed his beard and
announced, "I learned that dramatic
pause from a little girl in a gram
mar school when I used to teach."
The audience which he was ad
dressing in the Assembly Hall then
listened to Markham's exposition of
poetry. "What is poetry?" Markham
demanded of the welkin. "Nu one
knows what poetry is, therefore I
can talk on it at great length and in
great detail and say anything I
want to."
Poets Need Emotion
Markham affirmed that the pout
must be capable of surprise and
wonder, great emotion and the abil
ity to see the significance behind
material things.
Describing his experiences with
young poets, Markham told of a
young friend of his who had an ob
| session. "He thought he was a poet,
! and he sent me a poem entitled
, 'Why Am I Alive?'." Markham dc
i clared his interest in the poem, hav
! ing long wondered why this particu
! lar individual was alive. "Indeed,"
j.said Markham, "the only reason that.
' young gentleman is alive is because
| he did not present his poem to me
in person."
The aged and picturesque poet
appeared in his invariable wrinkled
tuxedo uad followed his delightfully
j mad lecture with readings "from the
1 ieast objectionable of my poems."
Recites Poems
He recited many of his more Jyriâ€”
j cal pieces and the long, rhetorical
j "Lincoln, the Man of the People."
iAt the insistence of the audience,
! Markham read his immortal "Man
With the Hoe," prefixing it with a
I long didactical description of the
j circumstances surrounding the com
| position of the poem, its reception
i by the public, and its deeper inner
meaning.
Following the lecture the poet
.searched for h' s satchel, hawked
! copies of "Lincoln" and the "Man
' With the Hoe," and some of his
I books, charging a dollar apiece for
! his signature. The money from this
I sale goes to charity, chiefly for the
| relief of the children of coal miners,
j So absorbed in this work was the
I weary poet, that he forgot entirely
{about the reception planned for him
{in the Women's Clubhouse. A truly
(colorful character, his audience
! seemed by its laughter to be well
I entertained.
