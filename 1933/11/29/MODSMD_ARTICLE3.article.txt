# Franco-German Arms
## 
### 
The Franco - German deadlock
over "arms equality" may be solved
by direct negotiations between the
two nations. French Foreign Office
indicated that France was ready -to
talk directly with Chancellor Hitler
1 hough any decisions would neces
sarily be made in consultation with
other war-time allies.
Foreign Minister Joseph Paul-
Boncour in a speech before the
Chamber invited Hitler to make his
armament demands more definite.
French press opinion remains very
cool to Hitler's bid for face-to-face
talks with France.
