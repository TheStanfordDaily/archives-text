# "Hate Stanford" Again
## 
### 
On the eve of California's Big (lame Rally (less than a
week ago; but now ancient history), the Daily Californian
printed another "Hate Stanford" editorial, excerpts of
which follow:
"Lot us lmte gloriously. Let lis breathe hate, smell hate,
speak hale, live hsile. Lei us hate so deeply and with such
feeling that the very heavens in Palo Alio will shrivel and
turn black. . . . Whv should we hate Stanford? Ask not
the reason why! Hate hut to do and die. In the rally to
liight Hate! In the classrooms tomorrow —Hate! On the
train, in the town, in the stadium Hate Stanford! . . .
Cleanse your souls of everything, brother, in good, clean,
fiery hate."
To assume that the editor wrote these immortal, war
stirring words with even a shadow of seriousness is to gasp,
then double over and guffaw without restraint. Rut we do
know that once, a California editor was serious in a Hate
Stanford manifesto, ft was 1930, the night of the Cal rally,
the night the Axe was removed from Berkeley by the "21."
The Axe was gone. The editor, still over-heated from
the Cal Bonfire, rushed to his typewriter and blared out
his fire-breathing Hate Stanford editorial. No one took it
very seriously, except the extreme rah rah boys at Cal.
Everyone at Stanford assumed, with kindness, that the
poor editor had wandered too close to the fire, and the
heat had not radiated sufficiently before the writing.
Perhaps, this editor too has been wandering too near
bonfires. Or maybe, he is laughing at the do-or-die sopho
mores with which his and all campuses abound.
There is a third possibility: the editor is attempting to
work up enthusiasm for the Big (lame. But if the Califor
nia student body can be agitated to football fervor with
such stuff, then, indeed, "Poor Cal" is a most proper root
ing section cry.
The fourth interpretation of this soul-stirring, heart
fluttering call to hate that it is seriuosly to be taken to
mean what it says is too tremendous to grasp in (Hie edi
torial.
Our reactions become slow, our words fail. We finally
gurgle:-"Strike us pink!"
