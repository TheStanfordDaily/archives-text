# New Fields to Conquer
## 
### 
Indications that everybody on the Farm is turning fa
vorably toward the ideals of what Stanford should be were
more thoroughly than ever revealed last night by members
of the Women's and Men's Councils. There has not been
a single violation so far this year of the honor code.
Considering that two-thirds of the present members of
the student body never paid their $11-1 before this quarter,
the record is more impressive than ever.
Hut the toughest part is yet to come. Finals are just
around the corner. Temptations will increase. The Coun
cils are doing their share by holding weekly meetings with
different groups of freshmen and explaining to them the
purposes of the code.
All that remains now is to have a perfect record at the
end of the quarter. Certainly it is worth striving for.
