Custom, habit, form, tradition—
that quaint quadrumvirate rules the
world.
Children, professors, students, and
statesmen daily avoid solution of
pressing problems by simply doing
the habitual, the customary thing.
Problem solving is not a matter of
"What can I do?" so much as "What
have I done before?"
And this is a good thing. For if
we were required to do original
thinking every time we took an ex
amination or ate spaghetti—this
would soon be a much crazier world,
not to mention a dizzy campus.
But things also become somewhat
berserk when habit runs hog wild.
When every unusual situation is met
in the usual way—the result is mis
management. Custom is fine as long
as it breathes, but when it must be
resuscitated by pulmotor squads and
medical corps, it were better let to
suffocate.
Stanford's administration has won
the spontaneous applause of the stu
dent body with its pronouncement
extending the Christmas recess.
Farm officials have demonstrated
their humaneness, their saneness,
their adjustability. For years we
have turned campusward on Janu
ary third; the mental path has been
deeply worn. The path now jogs to
the left; and the relief is refreshing.
We have come to expect dull
monotony and monotonous dullness
from the world-at-large. The busi
ness drudge — blue - denimed or
white collared—is sandwiched in be
tween a thousand roweling regula
tions. The unoriginalitv and stub
born opposition to the slightest

WHAT TO BE THANKFUL FOR?

change from routine of John-on-the
Street is notorious.
As a temporary respite before en
tering upon this iife of savage ac
tivity and mental atrophy, college
days should be distinct and apart.
The rah-rah boys are trying to
make it so—in one way. The ad
ministration should make it so in
another.
If the University can be alive to
change, awake to new ideas, and
the stimulating Alps while the mass
rolls on in its sub sea level Death
Valley—it becomes a revitalizing
element in the life of a nation.
