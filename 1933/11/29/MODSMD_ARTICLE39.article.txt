The Editor, Sir:
There is a many-headed Hydra
which hirks upon a round globe in
the heavens. It is a very large or
ganism, a powerful, brainless crea
ture capable of destroying all life.
This Hydra, far more dangerous
than the nine-headed monster which
Hercules slew, has risen, from its
dark abode this last week-end and
made its presence felt.
Friday' night the Hydra was a
quiet, enjoyable creature of 2,000
heads, which filled the Assembly
Hall with laughter and applause.
Saturday afternoon it grew to
huge dimensions, and roared its high
pitched feelings over the football
field.
Saturday night it tried to drown
its sorrows in drunken celebration,
but it succeeded only in miserable
failure.
And Sunday night the Hydra, In
its most ferocious form, broke loose
in San Jose, madly striving to ac
complish something about which it
knew nothing.

THE DRAGON

! This many headed organism is our
social structure, our population en
masse. Inasmuch as it is a living,
I acting organism, it must be treated
( as one, and must be punished for
its misdeeds.
But how is one going to tell a
Monster of 15,000 heads what is
wrong and what is right?
It's a cinch I'm not going to even
I try. â€”Winstead Weaver, '35.
