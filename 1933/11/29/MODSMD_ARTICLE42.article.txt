# A 						PLEA TO THOSE GOING SOUTH
## 
### 
I am not one to continually open my mouth,
But I must say a word to those driving South:
We Northerners, students and people, the lot,
By the Southern mass have been put on the spot.
By the rest of the state we are placed on probation
So let us be earelul while home this vacation.
Let us keep clear of the cops and their pinching,
And let us not brag of this San Jose lynching.
For after all, as college students,
We must show "Jtlrselves quite prudent,
And not and scream and wave our arms
And make- Southerners think that up here on the Farms
We're just a bunch of football fans
Who like to tear around and dans,
/tnd when there's nothing else to>do
Go out and lynch a guy or two.
That's my suggestion, and that's that.
Let's keep the whole damn mess right under our hat.
