## "HATE STANFORD," WITH SOME REACTIONS 
### 
After glancing over the Daily Cal
ifornian, student newspaper of U.C.,
issued the day before the Big Game,
one wonders what a sadly depraved
lot* of the nation's youths finds its
way into the doors "of the Berkeley
institution. Our reactions all revolve
around the so-called Blue and Gold
"Hate Stanford!" philosophy as
promulgated by one William "Fight -
in' Bill" Hudson sometime in the
spring of 1930 and cherished as a
notable California tradition since.
The Daily Californian was well
manured by this hate motif; it crept
into reports of the'men's pep rally;
it appeared ominously as a legend
over the starting line-ups; it was
blasted most banally on / the editorial
page.
This particular column may be a
questionable place to raise the ques
tion of student hymns of hate or
whatever one might call them, but
the fact that this California hate
does impinge on, and is connected
with, sport, qualifies it for discus
sion, we believe.
In the first place it is contrary to
our personal ideals of football as an
art, as expressed in this column be
fore; again, it is contrary to all ideals
of sportsmanlike conduct wherever
such exists; further, its approval by
the school's coach smacks of a hys
terical conception of football coach
ing methods.
Regarding the last clause: If Wil
liam "Fightin' Bill" Ingram believes
that he can win football games with
"Hate Stanford," "Hate U.5.C.,"
"Hate Santa Clara" or hate anyone
slogans, he will continue to turn
out just such kind of a football team
as he had this year, when, accord
ing to his own contention, with the
best football team on the Coast, he
lost three games and tied two.
Can you imagine Howard Jones
getting up before a congregation of
presumably intelligent young men
shouting, a la Hughey Long, that
"Stanford can't score on us. They
haven't done it for two years and
it's too G— d— late to start now!"
You may breed a tough bunch of
men with those beetle - browed
mouthings, but you will not make
a winning team without some meas
ure of scientific football, and after
three years of growling in the dark,
the Sailor man should get wise.
And in as revolting a bit of deca
dent literature as it has been our
disgust to read in a long while, the
Daily Californian exhorts sons of
the Blue and Gold to " . . . hate
gloriously .... breathe hate, smell
hate, speak hate, live hate. . . . that
the very heavens in Palo Alto will
turn black Would you like
your sister to be married to a Stan
ford man?"
There are many short comings to
Stanford University, its athletic
teams, its administration, its student
publications. But let us congratulate
ourselves that there are no "Fightin'
Bills" on the premises.—Hamilton

the Blue and Gold to " . . . hate
gloriously .... breathe hate, smell
hate, speak hate, live hate. . . . that
the very heavens in Palo Alto will
turn black Would you like
your sister to be married to a Stan
ford man?"
There are many short comings to
Stanford University, its athletic
teams, its administration, its student
publications. But let us congratulate
ourselves that there are no "Fightin'
Bills" on the premises.—Hamilton
After glancing over the Daily Cal
ifornian, student newspaper of U.C.,
issued the day before the Big Game,
one wonders what a sadly depraved
lot* of the nation's youths finds its
way into the doors "of the Berkeley
institution. Our reactions all revolve
around the so-called Blue and Gold
"Hate Stanford!" philosophy as
promulgated by one William "Fight -
in' Bill" Hudson sometime in the
spring of 1930 and cherished as a
notable California tradition since.
The Daily Californian was well
manured by this hate motif; it crept
into reports of the'men's pep rally;
it appeared ominously as a legend
over the starting line-ups; it was
blasted most banally on / the editorial
page.
This particular column may be a
questionable place to raise the ques
tion of student hymns of hate or
whatever one might call them, but
the fact that this California hate
does impinge on, and is connected
with, sport, qualifies it for discus
sion, we believe.
In the first place it is contrary to
our personal ideals of football as an
art, as expressed in this column be
fore; again, it is contrary to all ideals
of sportsmanlike conduct wherever
such exists; further, its approval by
the school's coach smacks of a hys
terical conception of football coach
ing methods.
Regarding the last clause: If Wil
liam "Fightin' Bill" Ingram believes
that he can win football games with
"Hate Stanford," "Hate U.5.C.,"
"Hate Santa Clara" or hate anyone
slogans, he will continue to turn
out just such kind of a football team
as he had this year, when, accord
ing to his own contention, with the
best football team on the Coast, he
lost three games and tied two.
Can you imagine Howard Jones
getting up before a congregation of
presumably intelligent young men
shouting, a la Hughey Long, that
"Stanford can't score on us. They
haven't done it for two years and
it's too G— d— late to start now!"
You may breed a tough bunch of
men with those beetle - browed
mouthings, but you will not make
a winning team without some meas
ure of scientific football, and after
three years of growling in the dark,
the Sailor man should get wise.
And in as revolting a bit of deca
dent literature as it has been our
disgust to read in a long while, the
Daily Californian exhorts sons of
the Blue and Gold to " . . . hate
gloriously .... breathe hate, smell
hate, speak hate, live hate. . . . that
the very heavens in Palo Alto will
turn black Would you like
