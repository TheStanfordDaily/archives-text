Nine hard - fought preliminary

number of entrants in the novice
boxing tournament to four in each
weight division. Those who won
their fights as well as those wlio re
ceived byes will fight it out Decem
ber ii in -the Pavilion for the all-

Three of yesterday's bouts were
stopped before their regular time of
three one and one-half minute
rounds, and the decision given on
technical knockouts. One real K.O.
was registered and the other fights
decided by judges' or referee's de
cisions.
Bill Sullivan, scrappy welter
weight, was the only fighter to take
part in two bouts yesterday. After
winning a close decision from Dick
Stark in the first round competition,
he came back to land a hard one in
Stekoll's solar plexus and win his
second round contest.
Frank Bowles looked impressive
in a second round technical K.O.
from Harold Fowler. Bowles is an
aggressive fighter with plenty of
power Tom Morrow and Dick Van
Wagmen showed a good brand of
boxing to win their junior-middle
weight bouts.
