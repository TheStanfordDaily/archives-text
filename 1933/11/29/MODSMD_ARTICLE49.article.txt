# ALUMNI, VARSITY HOOPSTERS MEET
## 
### 
In a game which was far from
brilliant basketball, but which gave
several fast-improving varsity can- J
didates a chance to show early sea- :
son form, Coach John Bunn's '34 !
hoopsters yesterday took on a five
who had gained names in past years j
as Card casaba aces—Cordry, '33, j
captain; Rothert, Glasgow, and La- |
Combe. Although no official score |
count was kept, estimations range
from a 2-1 win for the varsity to a
slim victory for the alumni.
Notable was the first, and perhaps
the last, appearance of Frenchy La-
Combe, who played a flashy guard
post on the varsity two years ago
and whose return 'to school is still
very doubtful. i
For the varsity, Gordy Mallatratt |.
showed an abundance of fight and an j
improving floor game at guard,
while Cosgrove looked strong on the
other side of the back court. Cap
tain Harold Edelen, though handi- j.
capped by only a meager amount of ,
practice, appeared to be bothered
but little by a knee still recovering
from a recent injury. Biff Jenkins
made the most of his tall bony j
frame under the bucket and potted
several set-ups.
The starting line-ups: Varsity— ,
Edelen and Anderson, forwards;
Jenkins, center; Mallatratt and Far
her, guards. Alumni—Cordry and j
Q'uade, '37, forwards; LaCombe,
center; Glasgow and Rothert, guards.
