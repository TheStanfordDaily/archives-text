# STANFORD POLO QUARTET PLAYS ARIZONA TOMORROW
## 
### 
In the first of the semi-annual
series that virtually settles western
I collegiate polo supremacy, a strong
, Stanford quartet will meet the con
j sistently-good University of Arizona
| riders tomorrow and Saturday in
Tuscon.
Though leaving Palo Alto last
night the Stanford poloists will not
arrive in Tuscon until an hour or
' two before game time because of a
1 stopover in Los Angeles today as
the guest of Will Rogers. Will Rog
;ers, Jr., coming by his polo propen
sities naturally, holds down the back
j position on the Stanford team.
Although the Arizona Wildcats
have a team that is rated on a par
! with their previous outstanding
quartets, the Stanford riders have
| one of the best opportunities in years
of upsetting the highly-touted
Southwesterners.
Under the capable tutelage of Cap
' tain Richard Gordan, Indian polo
; squads have steadily improved to
such an extent that Gordan consid
ers this year's team as the strongest
he has coached at Stanford.
Two veterans from last year, Cap-
I tain Luppe Luppen and Woody Me
i lone, hold down the number one
and tv/o positions in tomorrow's
starting line-up. Frank Burns,
i members of last year's squad, will
start at number Three while Bill
Rogers, poloist of several years' ex
| perience, stepped into the back po
| sit ion at the beginning of the season
; and has held it ever since.
Kemp Maer, fifth man making the
trip, will undoubtedly see action in
; both games. Maer, a substitute last

i with Burns for the regular number
j three position. Burns' rapid im
provement, however, has earned him
the first-string job.
A probable Arizona line-up would
include Captain Ducky Clark at one,
Lassiter at two, Budlong at three,
and Hargreaves at back. Clark and
Budlong were regulars on last year's
strong Wildcat team, while Har
greaves saw considerable action as
a substitute. Most serious loss to the
Arizonanians is Lewis Brown, star
i member of last year's quartet.
