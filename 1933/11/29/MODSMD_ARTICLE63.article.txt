INITIATIVE AND THE LITTLE THEATRE. A brief consideration of a
painfully predominant attitude.

At a recent meeting of various
little theatre groups for the purpose
of discussing a proposed association,
the three problems faced by each
of these- groups which found parti
cular stress were: the unduly high
royalty on older plays, the slow re
lease of new ones, and the possible
alleviation of these difficulties by a
stern co-operative bargaining with
play agents.
These problems may be consid
ered as the source of a majority of
the moaning which seems ever to
emanate from such groups. And they
are, it seems, indicative of a lack of
initiative and imagination upon the
part of these organizations.
In looking over the annual pro
duction record of almost any little
theatre group a heavy and undue
emphasis may be seen to be laid
upon such plays as have been rec
ognized on Broadway as financial
or "artistic" successes. The former
consist largely of the pseudo-prob
lem play which poses as comedy,
the drama which has arisen from
some journalistic, crisis (and which
is, too frequently, hastily slapped
together to catch audiences still
panting from the most sensational
headlines), and the whimsical sort
of thing which has inexplicably es
caped the polite damnation of the
"artistic success." To name three
plays fairly representative of each
genre: "The Animal Kingdom,"
"The Criminal Code," and "Mrs.
Moonlight."
Instead of worrying about the un
necessarily high royalties upon such
perhaps momentarily amusing but
obviously restricted and topical
plays; instead of attempting to
wrench the very latest thing off
Broadway (but not before a film
version has been generally circu

lated); and instead of seeking to
force the broker to accede to such
demands, would it not be somewhat
more aesthetically profitable and fi
nancially less demanding to consider
the virtues of such older plays as
have received a universal recogni
tion for lasting worth?
Audiences are once more able to
see through the alleged muck of Re
storation comedy, perceive the su
perlative wit of such of its master
pieces as "The Way of the World"
and the lesser if by no means du
bious comedy of "The Relapse."
Shakespeare's more romantic come
dies are regarded with the falsely
pedantic reserve which surrounds
"The Bard," and only considered as
climaxes to a year's production of
"less heavy" modern plays.
To name but a few of hundreds of
worthy and amusing plays, disre
garding altogether the more serious
dramas, would occupy more space
than is at my disposal. But a little
search on shelves other than that
occupied by the sacred anthologies
of His Serene Holiness Burns Man
tle, would bring to light plays which,
only because of their age, are re
garded by the average committee
on play selection as i mpossible.
With a little more regard to their
intrinsic worth and a little less de
pendence upon the sadly limited
view of such committees there would
probably result a season of more
genuine amusement and far greater
worth.
This is not to argue that the mod
ern play should be eschewed, rele
gated to a limbo comparable to that
in which Goldsmith and Marlowe—
insofar as the stage itself is con
cerned—linger, but merely that the
merits of these fine older plays
plays should at least be considered.
For any intelligent consideration
must necessarily result in an appre
ciation which is comparable to the
current awe surrounding them, than
to a restoration of at least a few of
them to the stage which is, after all,
their rightful place. —Sandoe
