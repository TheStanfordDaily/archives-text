# Women Must Pay Room Deposits by December 6
## 
### 
Room deposits of $5 for all under
graduate women students living in
University operated and supervised
living groups and returning for the
winter quarter must be made at the
i Dean of Women's office December
4 or 5 during office hours, 9-12 and
2-5 o'clock. If no deposit is made,
it is assumed that the student is not
returning and her place may be
filled. Checks should be made pay
able to Stanford University. If a
change of residence is desired, blank
forms may be filled out at the time
of making the deposit, and requests
will be granted when possible.
Since all University supervised
and operated living groups close 24
hours after the last examination, all
moving must be completed within
I that time or the privilege of chang
ing residence will be forfeited.
