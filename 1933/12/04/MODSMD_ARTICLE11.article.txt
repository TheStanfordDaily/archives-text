# Slang History Revealed By Stanford Professor
## 
### FRANCES AYRES 
Some of our modern figures of,
speech that sound up to the minute I
in sophisticated conversation go back
to the days of the caveman. This
was revealed by English Professor
William Hawley Davis, who has
made a study of tracking popular
phrases to their origin.
Speaking before the Philological
Association of the Pacific Coast at
a Los Angeles meeting this week
end, Professor Davis attributed some
of our figures of speech to the fol
lowing sources:
Age of Chivalry: buckle on your
armor, couch your spear, back on
your haunches.
Caveman Civilization: back
scratching, pits of their own dig
ging, cut-throat competition.
Pioneer Life: Stump the state, in
(he clear, have him over a barrel,

bring home the bacon, the wolf at
the door.
Farm Life: Sow and reap, lame
duck, cock of the walk, sheepish,
eggs in one basket, upsetting the
applecart.
Professor Davis has collected over
one thousand figures of speech, clas
sifying them into the period in which
they stood for some specific phase
of life.
"The history of civilization can be
traced in the words and expressions
we use in our every-day life," he
said.
Modern expressions .such as con
tact, basic metabolism, stream line,
and vitamin, purely the result of the
present culture, are already being
Used in connection with other things
than the ones they originated, he
pointed out.
