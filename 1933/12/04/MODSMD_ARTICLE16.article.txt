# German Play To Be Dec. 6
## Christmas Drama Will Have Austrian Atmosphere 
### Helene Ottenheimer 
The atmosphere of the Austrian
landscape and the psychology of the
Austrian people are skillfully por
trayed in the drama of Max Mell,
"Das Apostelspiel," which will be
presented Wednesday, December G,
at 7:30 o'clock in the Little Theatre !
by the German Players of Stanford !
University.
The playwright attended the Uni- j
versity of Vienna, the ancient city of !
the German rulers of the Holy Ro
man Empire. Here, in Vienna", the
crossing-point of the arteries of Oc- |
cidental history, he could listen to j
the heart-beat of world history in
the making. To him who studied |
among the traces of Roman rule, I
Byzantuim, and Jerusalem, of the j
Crusaders and the wars against the i
Turks, of the Lay of the Nibelungs !
and the Great Migrations, the name i
of the glorious House of Hapsburg j
will forever be dear.
Into his works, Mell has injected
the spirit of his native land; he
writes about things and events that
he has seen with his own eyes and
experienced with his own soul. The
keynote of Mell's works is an in- j
spired and ennobled patriotism and j
a deeply religious spirit, but his'
piety is universal in its nature; it is j
vehemently opposed to narrowness
and bigotry. It is for this reason
that audiences of the most diver- |
gent creeds, and particularly the j
youth, have acclaimed his plays so j
widely.
As to the "Apostelspiel," it has |
been spoken of as the sweet and I
ripe fruit of Mell's life. The plot j
reflects plainly the struggle between j
the forces that tear our modern civi- j
lization asunder. The questions of
the perennial value of Christian
principles as against the boLschevis
tic gospel of the earthly paradise is
put to test; and the answer hinges
upon the power of truth and love,
which is only dormant in the char
acters of the two criminals, but is !
called to life through the simple I
faith of a small and frail peasant !
girl.
The gripping power and strength j
of the play lies in its perfect sim- â– 
plicity. The author's fine social in- j
stinct, his profound sense of justice, i
permeates the whole.
