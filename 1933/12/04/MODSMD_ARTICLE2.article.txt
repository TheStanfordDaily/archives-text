# Japan Disagrees

### 
Japan does not agree in the least
little bit with Secretary Swanson's
statements that the present 5-5-3
navy ratio is pretty good. Says Jap
spokesman, "In a changing world,
nations cannot remain bound for
ever by old agreements. The Wash
ington Treaty is 12 years old and
totally inadequate from Japan's
standpoint."
