# ORATORS HOME AFTER DEBATES IN NORTHWEST
## Grander, Woodbury Meet New Canadian Premier, Education Heads 
### 
Flushed with victory and the I
pompous reception accorded them
by Canadian notables, Rollin Wood
bury and Bob Grander returned late
last week, 'culminating a two and a ;
half weeks' debate tour of British j
Columbia and Oregon.
Both debaters were enthusiastic ;
over the lavish and respectful at- :
tentions which were heaped upon J
them during their three-days' so- |
journ in America's northern neigh- |
j bor. "We were treated like ambas- j
sadors," they said.
Interview Premier
Interviews with the newly-elected i
Premier T. D. Pattulle, Minister of j
Education George Weir, and the \
I president of British Columbia Uni- i
j versity were only part of the ex- j
i tensive program which was accorded j
j them. Dining with some of Can- '
j ada's most prominent characters; j
j receptions, dances in their honor; a j
j car constantly at their service were J
j other features of the trip.
In spite of the fact that admission j
jto the debate required a monetary ;
j payment, there were 360 people'
present for the debate which took
place at the Hotel Vancouver on
November 17. Impressive in their |
academic robes, regulation apparel j
for debaters, the Stanford represen- j
tatives were received by the plaud
its of the audience.
"God Save the King"
Following the debate, the Card:
orators winning a 3-0 decision up- j
holding the affirmative of the ques- ;
tion, Resolved: That the U.S.' is !
largely to blame for the present
crisis in world affairs, they were
ushered out of the audience to the j
strins of "God Save the King," j
national English anthem. Inciden- '
tally, all public functions in British I
Columbia close with the playing ofj
the anthem, said Woodbury.
Commenting on the tour, Grantier J
said: "Debating is a major sport at |
the University of British Columbia j'
on a par with their most important i
football games. We were accorded
consummate hospitality during our 1
stay there and wo can honestly say
that we have never met more worthy j 1
opponents or a more inspiring audi- i
ence."
"Perfect Hosts"
Woodbury's impressions were ex- j
pressed as follows: "Dining in the ,
fine old English homes, eating skons j
and nut sandwiches, accepting the j
gracious and unbeatable hospitality !
of our perfect hosts, being treated i
like persons of real importance were j .
new experiences to us and were j ,
most enjoyable ones. The trip was \ ,
one of the greatest things of our':
lives. If there were a degree greater j
than the superlative, I might de- i (
scribe the time we had."
Leaving British Columbia on No- ,
vember 19, the Stanford forensic
warriors engaged in a series of five
non-decision debates with various! â– 
Oregon colleges, including Pacific j
University, Linfield University, Wil- .
lamette University, Albany, and 1
Oregon State College.
