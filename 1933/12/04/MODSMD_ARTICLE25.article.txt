# Silence Reigns Regarding Bid To East Team
## Al Masters South Again; Meets With Officials 
### Charles Chappell 
With the scattered pieces of the
Rose Bowl jig-saw puzzle scrambled
even further by week-end upsets
among Eastern grid teams, Stanford
officials were still silent last night
over the much-debated question of
who would represent the East in the
New Year's Day classic.
Beyond the fact that A1 Masters
has gorie South once more to confer
with Rose Bowl officials and that
negotiations were still being con
ducted, nothing definite could be
learned.
A rumor emanating from the East
to the effect that Columbia had been
chosen was promptly squelched last
night, although the fact that it could
arise only served to emphasize the
\yide-open nature of the field of pos
sibilities.
Army, Duke Beaten
Army and Duke, two of the chief
candidates for the Tournament of
Roses game, were both toppled from
their unbeaten pedestal in last Sat
urday's contests. Piling up a com
manding two-touchdown lead over
Notre Dame, the Cadets seemed cer
tain of victory only to have a fight
ing South Bend eleven stage a last
quarter -rally and pull a 13 to 12
win out of the carnage.
Duke, mentioned as virtually cer
tain of the invitation if it got by
last Saturday's hurdle, bowed to a
resolute and inspired Georgia Tech
eleven by a 6 to 0 score. The En
gineers out-rushed Wallace Wade*!*
men to the tune of 87 yards to two
in the opening periods of play.
Princeton Out
Princeton, only major team with
an unblemished record, eliminated
itself last week with an official
statement that the Tigers would be
unavailable for the Rose Bowl due
to a previous post-season agreement
with Yale. The Bengals' decisive 27
to 2 defeat of Yale last Saturday,
however, further established them
as the outstanding team of the East
and the most logical choice for the
New Year's game. Diehards were
still hoping that some way could be
found around the existing agree
ment with Yale which apparently
blocks all hopes of the Tigers' ac
ceptance.
Michigan, undefeated and tied but
once, has the next most impressive
record with most experts agreeing
that the Wolverines have one of the
most powerful squads of any college
in the nation. Finishing up its sea
son a week ago with a win over
Northwestern, Michigan carried off
the Big Ten championship for the
fourth successive time. Only a 0-0
tie with Minnesota mars its other- j
wise perfect record.
Michigan Slim Chance
Possibility of Michigan's accepting
the Rose Bowl inviation seemed re
mote, however, in view of a Big Ten
ruling against post-season games
that has kept representatives of that
conference out of the New Year's
Day contest for more than 10 years.
Opinion seems unanimous that tho
Wolverines, if they were to play,
would prove a colorful and popular
choice.
Since the topsy-turvy nature of
1933 football makes a once-defeated
team still a possibility for the invi
tation, it is quite probable that Army
is still in the running despite its
hair-breadth loss to Notre Dame.
