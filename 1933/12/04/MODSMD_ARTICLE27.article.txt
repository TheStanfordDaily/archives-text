# Canadian Publisher Airs Views on Soviet Russia
## 
### FRANCIS ROBINSON 
"Russia is swinging toward a mod
erate capitalism just as the United
States is beginning to display social
istic tendencies. The people of the
two countries are the same. They
have the same interests, emotions,
and desires. The only difference is
in standards of living."
Thus, Robert Cromie, Vancouver
publisher and world traveler, re
cently returned from Russia, voiced
his reaction to that country during
a visit to the Stanford campus.
All Russian workers do not re
ceive ihe same wages, he said. Those
who are able to save are permitted
to place the surplus in a private
bank account at 7 per cent interest.
The money is invested by the gov
ernment, however, and not used for
private enterprise. The accumula
tion of wealth is looked upon with

| disfavor but there is a tendency for
the individual to improve his own
; conditions as much as possible so
long as the gain is not through ex
portation or at the expense of others,
Cromie asserted.
"Call it communism, or what, you
will, the struggle for equality and
betterment of the common man has
become the religion of the Soviet
peoples. They have a definite ob
jective, an end to which they can
point. They have a plan for achiev
ing that end. In this they are more
fortunate than other Europeans and
I Americans."
The Vancouver newspaperman's
observations were not those of a
propagandist. They were merely the
simple reaction of an open-minded
visitor, "one with a world perspec
tive," as he called himself.
