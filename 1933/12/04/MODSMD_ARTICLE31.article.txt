# The 						Bawl-Out Must Go
## 
### 
Slanford heralds each now quarter not with orgiastic
dances in the Inner Quad, not with gay Bacchanalian rev
els in the Memorial Court but with the printing of a drab
enough appearing little booklet officially entitled "Direc
lory of Officers and Students." "We refer to nothing else
but the "Bawl-Out."
II contains much valuable information. It starts out
with a sure-fire reader's punch a calendar. The Daily
stands squarely behind calendars. Then a list of trustees
with their addresses. The Daily stands behind (far be
hind) the trustees. The book ends with pertinent infor
mation about lire whistles. Thus we learn that fire zone (»f>
is Shinkle's Ranch, It) finds us in the Kast Arboretum, while

Perhaps, a strange combination.
All Ibis is splendid. The Daily agrees with il, .thrills

Hul the most-road part of the Bawl-Out, as everyone
knows, are the grade-point averages of each student. It
is from this plus and minus numerology that the name
"Bawl-Out" is derived. And ii is this numerology that con
demns the Bawl-Out. II is this grade rating that marks this
viper in the educational grasses for certain death.
Why I his public airing of one's gades? Everything must
have a justification —especially something like this which
is a burden on the Registrar's Office.
Of course people's curiosity is satisfied by this grade
rating. But curiosity could just as well be satisfied bv
printing the student's weight, color of his hair, or whether
he favors cold showers in the morning.
* * *
The Bawl-Out does more than satisfy curiosity, how
ever. II gives peanut-minded readers opportunity to grade
papers on a student's Bawl-Out rating rather than his pro
ficiency in the examination at hand. A fancy average will
carry the student through many a blurbing blue-book;
while the poor student is immediately nabbed. His flowery
nothings are branded for what they are—flowery nothings.
Rank injustice, but inevitable with a Bawl-Out and with
readers.
Professors too are often prone to judge the student be
fore him not on what he does, but on what he is—in the
Bawl Out. A student carries his scarlet letter of scholastic
sin before him wherever he goes. Never is he allowed to
reform and lead a noble life again. Sinning he must go,
now and forever.
But the principal "advantage" of this little instrument
of grade exposal is its incentive to bigger things. The Ad
ministration probably feels that "shamed" students (who
never feel the shame) will study hard to rid themselves of
a poor showing. That is probably academic theory—at its
purest. But granting il were true, then the "Bawl-Out" is
doubly damned.
For anyone who works for grades is losing his college
opportunity just as surely as the person who/becomes
overly immersed in journalism or football. The person
who digs for grades is as pitiful as a Pennsylvania coal
miner. Dig, dig, scratch, dig with no more understanding
of why or wherefore than a drunken chicken after worms.
Study is fine; education is fine; but grades? That system
of digits that provides registrars with something to do;
that necessary evil in an era of degrees and such rot! Why
Haunt grades? Why pretend they mean anything?
The Bawl-Out must go. ICducators, many administra
tors, the Bull Session have already pointed the disapprov
ing digit.

Hul the most-road part of the Bawl-Out, as everyone
knows, are the grade-point averages of each student. It

"Bawl-Out" is derived. And ii is this numerology that con
demns the Bawl-Out. II is this grade rating that marks this
viper in the educational grasses for certain death.
Why I his public airing of one's gades? Everything must
have a justification —especially something like this which
is a burden on the Registrar's Office.
Of course people's curiosity is satisfied by this grade

The Bawl-Out does more than satisfy curiosity, how
ever. II gives peanut-minded readers opportunity to grade
papers on a student's Bawl-Out rating rather than his pro
ficiency in the examination at hand. A fancy average will
carry the student through many a blurbing blue-book;
while the poor student is immediately nabbed. His flowery
nothings are branded for what they are—flowery nothings.
Rank injustice, but inevitable with a Bawl-Out and with
readers.
Professors too are often prone to judge the student be
fore him not on what he does, but on what he is—in the
Bawl Out. A student carries his scarlet letter of scholastic
sin before him wherever he goes. Never is he allowed to
reform and lead a noble life again. Sinning he must go,
now and forever.
But the principal "advantage" of this little instrument
of grade exposal is its incentive to bigger things. The Ad
ministration probably feels that "shamed" students (who
never feel the shame) will study hard to rid themselves of
a poor showing. That is probably academic theory—at its
purest. But granting il were true, then the "Bawl-Out" is
doubly damned.
For anyone who works for grades is losing his college
opportunity just as surely as the person who/becomes
overly immersed in journalism or football. The person
who digs for grades is as pitiful as a Pennsylvania coal
miner. Dig, dig, scratch, dig with no more understanding
of why or wherefore than a drunken chicken after worms.
Study is fine; education is fine; but grades? That system
of digits that provides registrars with something to do;
that necessary evil in an era of degrees and such rot! Why
Haunt grades? Why pretend they mean anything?
The Bawl-Out must go. ICducators, many administra
