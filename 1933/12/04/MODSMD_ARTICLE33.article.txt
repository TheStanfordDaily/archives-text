# What About Some Light?

The Administration, co-operating as it does, has agreed
lei the proposal to add an extra day to the holiday vaca
tion in order that students attending the Rose Howl game
January 1 may have time to drive home at other than a
breakneck-speed.
The Administration, co-operating as it can, might do
a good turn once again by installing two or three strong
lights which will enable hall residents to walk through the
Meld south of the library safely. There is no need for light
poles. Thev already are there. The corner of the library
would serve nicely at the other end, and the rocks and
rills which give us thrills could be eliminated.
Costs? They would he small. As the Daily pointed out
in an earlier editorial on this same subject, power costs
would be almost nil. Inasmuch as the University already
has an electric plant working, the few additional watts
would never be missed. What say?

The Daily Staff meets today at 1:15 o'clock. This is a
custom, not a tradition (outworn custom).
