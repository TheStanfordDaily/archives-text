"Four walls do not a prison make,"
tra la, tra la, tra la. Those are not
the words of a jailbird. For if walls
do not make a prison, they do make
it painfully realistic.
Dull lectures, dismal texts, and
detailed exes do not make life com
pletely horrible, but they do make
for boredom. And though the smells,
chills, and bugs which infest Stan
ford buildings do not make one go
completely nuts, they do make one
teel creepy, cold, and caustic.
"Drafts" (or if you are highbrow,
"draughts") are horrid things, but
they're decidedly worse in the As
sembly Hall. Rushing in at the.
doors, crawling through a thousand
cracks, wriggling their way through
the very walls—"drafts" have ruined
more than one Stanford lecture. It
is difficult to take in the wisdom
assailing the ears, when chills are
waging a concentrated attack on
each of the five lumbar vetebrae.
"Smells"—no less than their chilly
comrade-fiends —help to dull the
Farm's finer sensibilities. In a mod
ern University, where the torch of
learning is supposed to have burned
out the crudities of life, it is shame
ful, not to say, disgusting, to find
the campus saddled with Nasal Nau-

SMELLS, CHILLS, AND BUGS!

'sea. From a hundred whitewashed
or tiled cubicles rise these unhealthy
stenches. Throughout the day—and
! on into the night—these hideous va
pors make life uncomfortable.
| "Bugs," represented chiefly by
black ants, but not unrepresented
by moths, and other insectae, do
their little bit toward making the
campus squirm. Served up in cooked
food, they are not bad, but in wash
basins and other receptacles, in cere
als and cakes, they are unbearable.
What to do?
The costs of warmth and cleanli
ness are slight. Weatherstrips and,
in some case, merely locks would

I draft total. These are little devices
I which long ago found their place in
'the "outside" world, and'should not
be unknown at Stanford.
Scientific deodornts nd insecti?

plied, would rid living quarters of
1 smells and bugs. Here, again, the
I costs should not be prohibitive.
Even if it is necessary to sacrifice
lon some items, it is vitally neces
