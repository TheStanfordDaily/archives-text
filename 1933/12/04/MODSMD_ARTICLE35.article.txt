The Editor, Sir:
Some time ago, the Daily pub
lished the results of a question
naire anent sororities and a check
up revealed that approximately GO
per cent of the present crop of
women wishing to pledge to the nine
campus sororities will be sadly dis
appointed when pledge night rolls
around this year.
A quiet investigation on the side
conducted among sorority women
and sponsors brings the added reve
lation that most of them are rather
irked at the Daily's questionnaire
and at the publication of its results.
The Ruble sponsors in particular are
loud in denunciation alleging, that
as a result, the freshmen are very
jittery, beleaguer them with ques
tions, and, in general, work them
selves into a froth worrying over
whether they will be able to make
the grade.
One could say that this early
scare has played itself out, and the
freshmen have eased back into the
humdrum of Cit. lectures and have
forgotten this whole business. But
the advent of sorority teas, starting
Wednesday, has created a new
panic.
And in one way, the Daily's de
noucement is not as black as the
sponsors would paint it. It has put
the fear of the Greek gods into their
hearts in advance; definitely they
know the inevitable; they have
many weeks to rake up a bevy of
good answers when someone asks
them which sorority is theirs.
If all the freshmen could sit in on
one of two Monday night house
meetings, they might realize what
they're letting themselves in for. If
they could listen in on a good post
mortem following a rushing party,
legal or illegal, to see the sisters fly
at each other's pet proteges, to hear
veiled slurs and slams until a climax
of personal diatribes and hysteria
throws the house into catty cliques
and a battleground of feminine psy
chology at its worst, perhaps that
60 per cent would diminish.
They should know how many
more fights and brawls there are
over trivialities that only women
can bicker; political intrigues before

They should know the pitiful
plight of the girl who pledges and
doesn't get along—worse, the one
that's initiated and doesn't get along.
They must realize that their friend
ships made in Roble will be broken
when they take the brass and leave
the "unfortunates" in the hall. They
must realize that they are now
Greeks, they're better than the
others, they have more social pres
tige, they have more dates, they are
beyond reproach.
And after all this, they can con

shows, and football games, auks

Some time ago, the Daily pub
lished the results of a question
naire anent sororities and a check
up revealed that approximately GO
per cent of the present crop of
women wishing to pledge to the nine
campus sororities will be sadly dis
appointed when pledge night rolls
around this year.
A quiet investigation on the side
conducted among sorority women
and sponsors brings the added reve
lation that most of them are rather
irked at the Daily's questionnaire
and at the publication of its results.
The Ruble sponsors in particular are
loud in denunciation alleging, that
as a result, the freshmen are very
jittery, beleaguer them with ques
tions, and, in general, work them
selves into a froth worrying over
whether they will be able to make
the grade.
One could say that this early
scare has played itself out, and the
freshmen have eased back into the
humdrum of Cit. lectures and have
forgotten this whole business. But
the advent of sorority teas, starting
Wednesday, has created a new
panic.
And in one way, the Daily's de
noucement is not as black as the
sponsors would paint it. It has put
the fear of the Greek gods into their
hearts in advance; definitely they
know the inevitable; they have
many weeks to rake up a bevy of
good answers when someone asks
them which sorority is theirs.
If all the freshmen could sit in on

meetings, they might realize what
they're letting themselves in for. If

at each other's pet proteges, to hear
