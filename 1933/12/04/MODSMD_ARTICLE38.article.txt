# Picket Church
## 
### 
Because Pastor Darlington of the j
Protestant Episcopal Church of the
Heavenly Rest indorsed Governor j
Rolph's "two murders for one" j
stand, New York theological students i
yesterday picketed his Fifth Avenue â– 
Church. Result: three arrests.
The pastor later recanted his in
dorsement "upon further considera
tion of the facts."
