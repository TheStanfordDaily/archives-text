CHRISTOPHER BEAN (MGM)
At the Stanford Theatre
In addition to razors, rivers. I
acids, drugs, nooses,'gas, and guns—J
Dorothy Parker's seven good means j
' and true—there is yet another
; method of suicide, less common, but ,
j just as certain: criticize a Marie j
Dressier picture. But, anyhow—
j "Christopher Bean" is founded on
la good and painfully true idea; it j
treats of how men are not appro- j
ciated until after their deaths. In j
this instance it is the name charac
ter, a poor painter, whose works j
acquire a tremendous value several j
years after his demise. During his j
! lifetime he has been appreciated |
only by Abby, servant to the grasp-
I ing Haggett family.
But beyond the initial idea, the
picture fails miserably. The story
i has been distorted to give focus to
the antics of the star, which are car- j
l ied to such an extreme that the i
high point of the picture—the "big j
laugh"—is Dressier at the wheel of J
a runaway flivver. Ho hum.
Roughly half of the picture is de- ,
voted to the efforts of the omnivo- i
I rous liaggetts to get Bean's master
piece away from their faithful Abby.
If the director's aim was to create
suspense, he has done it with a
! vengeance, but he simply didn't real
ize that there was a point beyond
j which. .... And during this process
I characters are ushered in and out of
! the action with less motivation than
i the waves of the sea.
Miss Dressler's performance is the
usual mingling of pathos, comedy,
facial grimaces, and slightly off
color incidents, and as such will be
treasured by all Dresslerites.
Lionel Barrymore had the odds
I against him, and his perfoi-mance is
the least convincing thing he has
ever done. Beulah Bondi is able in
her usual type-role. —Chapin

**ONLY YESTERDAY (Universal)
At the California Theatre

Here is a fine picture: a sincerely
moving story told by Director John
M. Stahl with the same fidelity and
artistry that characterized his pro
duction of "Back Street," which the
current film resembles only in that
it too treats of a great love story.
Told in the flash-back method, the
love story is brought to the screen
by Margaret Sullivan and John
Boles, whose strikingly genuine
performances make the film the
great thing that it is. It is a story
which uses the War as its initial
complication but which outgrows
any of the conventionality of that
type of story. Boles is Jim Emer
son, who is called to war before he
is able to marry Mary Lane (Miss
Sullivan), and who, on his return,
has forgotten her. The successive
events and the denouement are
original in their conception and
execution, which latter is accom
plished with the aid of the skilled
cast.
Margaret Sullivan, not often beau
tiful in the conventional sense, is
always sincere and convincing in
her role of the mother. She ages ef
fectively both in looks and manner,
and in every scene manages to cap
ture wholly the tragedy of the film.
Boles, who by now should be used
to this type of part (e.g., "Seed,"
"Back Street," etc.) seems to gi-ow
histrionically with each characteri
zation. His delineation of Emerson
is a perfect complement to the
splendid performance of Miss Sulla
van.

Second only to the two leads is
Billie Burke, who gives a charming
performance, filled with poise, fresh
ness, and the delicate humor which i
| only she can achieve. As her hus
: band, Reginald Denny is surpris

ingly good, and the rest of ihe cast
—which is large and well-chosen—
are uniformly capable. —Chapin
