The screwy paradox involved in
the above caption resembles the
post-repeal mouihings of an escaped
alcoholic in the bizarre delight of
delerium tremens. It is not. Rather,

Always popular, this year's tour
ney promises greater fisticuffs than
heretofore since the grand total of
38 men signed up, of which 27 bat

vilion. The 27 will meet in 1!) bouts, ;
all of which may be attended by
Stanford men and women who pre
sent their student body cards and
25 cents at the gate.
Enough of statistics, They bore
me as much as you. The dope bucket
spilled the news that the feather- j
weights boast four fine lads who j
promise active action in the semi

dynamite; transfer Cabby Caballero; \
sophomore Ralph Purdy; and fresh- i
man Paul Cain are the four mighty j
atoms.

four heavyweights have entered. ,
Fistically speaking, they Are all un
known. Basketball ically speaking, 1
AI Hershey, one of the fighters, is a
name already as he is a center of j
repute. Hershey's' opponents-to-be
include John Miller, Jim Kellogg I
from the distant province of Win

from the equidistant province of El
Paso.
