# CIRCLE "S" GETS PHILANTHROPIC
## 
### 
In the well-stacked Stanford tro- j
phy room sit a couple of trophy cases
which display the winnings of Card I
stars and teams. These cases, use- !
ful and ornamental, were placed in ,
the trophy room due to the popular
ity of previous novice boxing tour- 1
naments.
The story: the fisticuffs are put on ;
each year by Circle "S," honorary \
society whose membership is chosen ;
from the award-winners in minor!
sports. When the tournament makes |
money (as it always has) Circle
"S" swells its scanty funds. When
the funds accumulate, Circle "S" j
spends them on something useful. !
Hence the trophy cases.
And hence also the future of your
two-bits in case you attend tomor- i
row's fights.
