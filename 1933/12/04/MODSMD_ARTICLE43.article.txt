The following all-star team was !
actually chosen, and not by the
Stanford squad.
LE —Moscrip.
LT—Reynolds.
LG—Corbus.
C—Muller
RG—Corbus
RT—Reynolds.
RE—Moscrip.
Q —Grayson.
LH—Grayson.
RH— Grayson or Hamilton.
FB—Grayson.
It was this way. The Southern
California team was asked to choose'
an all-opponent and, forgetful of
position, the Trojans named one to |
four men for each of the eleven jobs, |
including the above nominees. That
is. Reynolds (Stanford's left tackle)
was Troy's first- choice for right
tackle, Troy's second choice for left i
tackle. Corbus was first choice at
both guards; Wes Muller, second
choice center, was third-choice left
tackle; Hamilton tied for second- j
string right half with Grayson and
Franklin.
But the wierdest part the whole
business was the naming of Bobby !
Grayson at each and every one of
the backfield positions. First-string
fullback, second-string quarterback, i
first-string left half, and second- j
string hight half—this man Grayson
seems versatile.
Monk Moscrip was Troy's only;
unanimous choice. Strangely enough,
he was actually named as the all- '
opponent squad's right end, being a i
nice second-string left flankman.

And then there was the one about
the lady whose stockings ran when
ever she walked.
