### Charles Chappell 
Finally achieving a long-sought
victory over the powerful University
of Arizona polo quartet, the Stan
ford riders took the first game of
their Thanksgiving vacation series
with the Wildcats in Tuscon by an
11 to 7 score, only to drop the sec
ond 12-8.
The first game, played last Fri
day instead of Thanksgiving Day as
planned, saw the Indian malletmen
get off to a flying start, piling up a
commanding 9 to 12 lead at the end
of the half. Although an Arizona
rally in the final chukker netted
three goals, the Stanford lead was
never threatened after the first few
minutes of play.
Brown Scores First
Brown of Arizona started the first
period scoring spree, but Frank
Burns quickly countered for Stan
ford with two goals in rapid succes
sion while Rogers and Luppen ac
counted for two more after perfectly
executed plays had put them in
scoring position.
Bill Rogers at back led the Stan
ford scoring attack, scoring four
goals, while Burns accounted for
three and Luppen and Melone for
two each. Smooth-functioning team
work, however, was the main factor
in the Stanford victory.
The second game was a repetition
of the first, with the advantage
going in favor of Arizona this time.
The Wildcats did practically all their
scoring in the first three chukkers,
running up an 11 to 1 advantage at
the end of the half.
Indians Rally
Though only scoring one goal in
the first half, the Stanford riders
came back strong in the last three
periods, rolling up seven counters
while holding Arizona to one. De
spite this concluding rally that net
ted four goals in the last chukker,
the initial Arizona lead was too
much for the Indians, the game end
ing with the Cards on the short end
of the 12 to 8 score.
Stanford's line-up for both games
consisted of Captain Luppe Luppen
at number one, Woody Melone at
two, Frank Burns at three, and Bill
Rogers at back. Kemp Maer was
the fifth member of the Stanford
squad.
