# BEAR WATER POLO SQUAD GAINS HIGH COAST RATING
## 
### GRAY CREVELING 
California's water poloisLs gave
Stanford a real bailie last Tuesday
at Berkeley and it, was all the Card
splashers could do to'win the game
1 in the last 10 seconds of play, 5-4.
The Bears have come up from ob
scurity in the water polo world to
a place where their team ranks with
the best in Northern California.
In the last minutes of the game,
Jimmy Triolo scored a goal to even
things up with the golden ones who
had led up to this point 4-3. It
looked like the game would have to
go into an extra period before Vlad
Taranik lobbed one in over the
j goalie's head just before the gun
ended the game.
The Indians were pretty well bot
tled up by the Bear's defense, and
California did I heir scoring by
shooting the ball by long passes to
the man in the hole who either
tipped them in or broke away from
Stanford's guard to get a clean shot
at the goal.
j High point man Taranik, who
scored three goals, put one into the
! cage in the early part of the strug
[ gle. Captain Gordy Graves then
! tallied another for Stanford, and the
! team seemed to be off to the races.
Bear Ed Davis broke into the score
column by tipping a shot into the
goal. He was the first to score for
California, and like the Cards' ini
tial tallier went on to be high point
man for his team, scoring three.
Wally Wiget was taken from the
game for fouling, but in spite of the
handicap Stanford went on to score
i once more. Taranik tobk a pass from
Triolo and whizzed it past Califor
nia's goalie. Davis of the Bears tal
' lied his second as the half ended.
Stanford 3; California 2.
"This is a helluva half time score
for a Cal water polo game," team
members commented, and the I

splashers went back into the game
determined to run up a tremendous
score against the Gold and Blue.
Equally - determined Californians
stood off a renewed Card offense.
Smith flipped the ball in to tie things
up as Leo Cook was taken from the
game for a deliberate foul, leaving
the goal unprotected. Ed Davis
scored again for the Berkeley boys,
and ii looked like Stanford's mighty
undefeated varsity was going down
to inglorious defeat.
But a Cal man fouled by drifting
inside of the two-yard line and was
taken from the game. With Triolo
free, the Cards tallied as the little
sprint drifted unmolested in front of
the goal and got the ball in.
As the game neared its close, it
appeared that it would have to go
into an extra period to break the
l deadlock, but Taranik from the side
of the pool tossed one over the
goalie's head. The game ended just
after another play. Stanford water
polomen were never quite as glad
j to have a game finished, came out of
the pool winners by a scant one
goal margin, 5-4.
A1 Dowden, the California coach,
has made a real water polo team
out of his old prep-school stars who
followed him from Santa Ana High
! and the next watery Big Game will
be an even closer struggle as the
i Bear will improve. Possibly the
only thing that this team lacks is
experience and they will have suf
ficient by the time they clash again
with Stanford.

the goal unprotected. Ed Davis
scored again for the Berkeley boys,

undefeated varsity was going down
to inglorious defeat.

The Indians were pretty well bot
