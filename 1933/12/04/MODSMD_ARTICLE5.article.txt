# Irish Independence
## 
### 
England and Ireland are both I
pretty much in a state of excitement i
but aren't sure what they are ex
cited about. The trouble: Ireland's j
President de Valera has sent to J. H. J
Thomas, His Majesty's Secretary for :
Domininions, a communication "of j
the gravest imperial importance."
The fear is that Ireland is about to i
declare its complete independence.:
No one in either England or Ireland |
can be found who will make a
statement on the letter.
