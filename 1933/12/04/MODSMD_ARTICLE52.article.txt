-1 nament.
j Plenty of action is guaranteed for
i the entertainment of all comers as
| these determined fighters battle for
the gold boxing gloves that sym
bolize all-University supremacy in
the art of self-defense.
Interest in Heavyweights
| With a full card of close contests
! scheduled, interest is centered
! around the heavyweight class which
j has attracted more promising leath
i er-pushers than it has for several
i years. Lightweight and feather
! weight divisions should provide the
! closest competition of the evening.
The present schedule calls for an
j exhibition match in the bantam-
I weight class between Monroe Allen,
j who is the only entrant in this
| weight, and Don Brown, who weighs
iin at 128 pounds. Coach Schall is
| still hopeful of securing another
j bantamweight to compete with Al
! len.
Featherweights Named
Stennet Sheppard and "Cabby"
j Caballero are given a slight edge
over their other featherweight com-
I petitors, Paul Cain and Ralph Pur
j day, however, all of these fighters
j show plenty of class and decisions
| should be close.
According to the pre-fight dope,
; Frank Bowler and Lyman Breed
j should prove the class of the light
j weight contenders.
Sullivan is probably the outstand
j ing welterweight, followed closely
by Joe Rea and Randy Hill, while
j Tom Morrow and Dick Van Wage
i nen have showed up well in the
! junior-middleweight class.
Collins Given Edge
There will be only two bouts in
! the middleweight class because only
j three have signed in this division.
: The fights should be close with Tom
Collins having a very slight edge.
! The light-heavyweight fight between
| Frank Ingersoll and Ed Fisher
should be a toss-up.
The heavyweight contests will be
! hard to call. A1 Hershey has shown
lup well in previous work but he
! meets tough opposition from John
; Miller, Ralph Mac Michael, and Jim
j Kellogg.

Interest in Heavyweights
| With a full card of close contests
! scheduled, interest is centered
! around the heavyweight class which
j has attracted more promising leath
i er-pushers than it has for several
i years. Lightweight and feather
! weight divisions should provide the
! closest competition of the evening.
The present schedule calls for an
j exhibition match in the bantam-
I weight class between Monroe Allen,
j who is the only entrant in this
| weight, and Don Brown, who weighs
iin at 128 pounds. Coach Schall is
| still hopeful of securing another
j bantamweight to compete with Al
! len.
Featherweights Named
Stennet Sheppard and "Cabby"
j Caballero are given a slight edge
over their other featherweight com-
I petitors, Paul Cain and Ralph Pur
j day, however, all of these fighters
j show plenty of class and decisions
| should be close.
According to the pre-fight dope,
; Frank Bowler and Lyman Breed
j should prove the class of the light
j weight contenders.
Sullivan is probably the outstand
j ing welterweight, followed closely
by Joe Rea and Randy Hill, while
j Tom Morrow and Dick Van Wage
i nen have showed up well in the
! junior-middleweight class.
Collins Given Edge
There will be only two bouts in
! the middleweight class because only
j three have signed in this division.
: The fights should be close with Tom
Collins having a very slight edge.
! The light-heavyweight fight between
| Frank Ingersoll and Ed Fisher
should be a toss-up.
The heavyweight contests will be
! hard to call. A1 Hershey has shown
lup well in previous work but he
! meets tough opposition from John
; Miller, Ralph Mac Michael, and Jim
j Kellogg.
