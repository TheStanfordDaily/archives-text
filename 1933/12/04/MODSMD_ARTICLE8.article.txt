As usual, the French cabinet is on
the verge of collapse. The treasury j
is emptying fast, gold is leaving the j
country, general strike is threat
ened, and farmers are screaming j
about the high wages of government |
employees. The biggest trouble: the
budget won't balance and all the
politicians refuse to help lower the
costs of government. Government I
functionaries will strike if pay is
cut, if not, farmers will strike.
