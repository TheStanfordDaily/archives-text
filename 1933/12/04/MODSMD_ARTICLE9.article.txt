# "RICHARD II" IS SCHEDULED FOR NEXT THURSDAY
## Sword and Sandals to Give Final Autumn Quarter Play Reading LARGE CAST CHOSEN Many Excellent Actors Will Interpret Parts 
### Ann Hemingway 
Little known to the stage and
ifar worthier of representation than
many more familiar dramas is
Shakespeare's early historical play,
i "Richard II," which Sword and San
; dais has selected as its second read
, ing for the fall quarter.
The play will be read next Thurs
| day evening in the Little Theatre.
The curtain is scheduled for 7:30
I o'clock, and will rise promptly. A
) cast of 20 readers, the largest thus
; far used by Sword and Sandals in a
: play reading, has been selected and
i is rehearsing.
Play Is "Cut"
It has been found necessary and
Judicious to eliminate various scenes
from the play to facilitate a reading
; within the space of the usual read
ing time. This has served, as well,
to fix the attention upon the central
! figure more sharply than the some
! what sprawling play permits in its
| totality.
I The play concerns Richard of Bor
j deaux, King of England at the end
: of the 14th century, and his deposi
j tion by the rebellious Henry Boling
broke whose methods are less meek
i than his ineffective disguise of hu
j mility before the powerless king.
Why this play (like the even
greater "Coriolanus" and "Anthony
I and Cleopatra") is so infrequently
staged must remain a matter for
conjecture. It is far more pro
! foundly moving than the sensational
I "Richard III" and as an early com
position it has not greater technical
faults tHan the ever-popular "Ro
meo and Juliet," an even earlier
I Play-
Stratford Performance
But one performance of the play
: has come to the notice of Sword and
Sandals. The Stratford Company
' presented it in San Francisco during
j its tour four or five years ago. At
; that time George Hayes played the
I leading role.
The cast, which will include
novices as well as more experienced
campus actors, is predominantly
| male. There are only two female
roles; these will be read by Myna
Hughes and Henrietta Jones. A
complete cast will appear in the
near future.
This is Sword and Sandals' first
attempt to read a play by this great
est of playwrights and it is to be
hoped that the difficulties which the
reading of blank verse present to
eyes accustomed to prose as well as
the horrors of rhetorical declama
tion may be avoided. The cast is
striving, at least, to overcome the
first and escape the second pitfall.

Hughes and Henrietta Jones. A
complete cast will appear in the
near future.
This is Sword and Sandals' first
attempt to read a play by this great
est of playwrights and it is to be
hoped that the difficulties which the
reading of blank verse present to
eyes accustomed to prose as well as
the horrors of rhetorical declama
tion may be avoided. The cast is
striving, at least, to overcome the
first and escape the second pitfall.
Little known to the stage and
ifar worthier of representation than
many more familiar dramas is
Shakespeare's early historical play,
i "Richard II," which Sword and San
; dais has selected as its second read
, ing for the fall quarter.
The play will be read next Thurs
| day evening in the Little Theatre.
The curtain is scheduled for 7:30
I o'clock, and will rise promptly. A
) cast of 20 readers, the largest thus
; far used by Sword and Sandals in a
: play reading, has been selected and
i is rehearsing.
Play Is "Cut"
It has been found necessary and
Judicious to eliminate various scenes
from the play to facilitate a reading
; within the space of the usual read
ing time. This has served, as well,
to fix the attention upon the central
! figure more sharply than the some
! what sprawling play permits in its
| totality.
I The play concerns Richard of Bor
j deaux, King of England at the end
: of the 14th century, and his deposi
j tion by the rebellious Henry Boling
broke whose methods are less meek
i than his ineffective disguise of hu
j mility before the powerless king.
Why this play (like the even
greater "Coriolanus" and "Anthony
I and Cleopatra") is so infrequently
staged must remain a matter for
conjecture. It is far more pro
! foundly moving than the sensational
I "Richard III" and as an early com
position it has not greater technical
faults tHan the ever-popular "Ro
meo and Juliet," an even earlier
I Play-
Stratford Performance
But one performance of the play
: has come to the notice of Sword and
Sandals. The Stratford Company
' presented it in San Francisco during
j its tour four or five years ago. At
; that time George Hayes played the
I leading role.
The cast, which will include
novices as well as more experienced
campus actors, is predominantly
| male. There are only two female
roles; these will be read by Myna
Hughes and Henrietta Jones. A
complete cast will appear in the
near future.
