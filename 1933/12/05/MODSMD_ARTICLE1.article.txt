## Repeal Finale 
### 
Pennsylvania and Ohio will vote
in today on repeal and it will be
left to Utah to finish the job. Con
vention there will start at noon
(M.S.T.) but roll call of the 21 dele
gates will carry proceedings well
into the afternoon.
Taxes expected to total $200,000,-
000 are to replace special levies that
end with repeal. Administrator
Choate said that his activities to
control the situation will start im
mediately, but much organizing
work remains undone. Negotiations
are being planned with foreign coun
tries to exchange our wheat surplus
for wines and spirits.

California: State and local offi
cials will co-operate in issuance of
Jicenses. State tax: wine and beer
at 2 cents per gallon. Back-room
bars will not be permitted. En
forcement of state lav/ will be in
hands of state and local officials.
Hotel and cafe men want liberaliza
tion of state liquor control, letting
them in on the gravy train. Rumors
have spread that Board of Equaliza
tion would not co-operate with local
authorities in administration of the
new state liquor law. Fred E. Ste
wart of the Board spiked this rumor
yesterday: Every peace officer will
be empowered to enforce the law,
pi'osecute in local courts.

Disputes as to how much Presi
dent Roosevelt and Postmaster Gen
eral Farley had to do with repeal
were settled today: When running'
for governor in New York the Pres
ident stated that he was for repeal.
As candidate for President he reit
erated his stand. After inauguration
Farley has been busy writing let
ters, making speeches for repeal.
The idea that the administration
straddled the issue is smashed.
