best novice leather pushers face
each other on the canvas covered
arena of the Pavilion at 8 o'clock.
Admission to this annual novice
tournament, sponsored by the Cir

card, of 50 cents for off-campus
spectators.
Eleven semi-final, one exhibition,
and seven final bouts are on to

all the other classes with the excep
tion of the light-heavyweight.

consist of three one and one-half
