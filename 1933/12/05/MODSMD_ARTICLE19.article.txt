# ALUMNAE STOP TRY TO CHANGE CAP AND GOWN
## Membership Question Left Open; Dear, Millard Lead Movement 
### 
Pressure from alumnae and a few
| active members resulted last night
in stopping action to make member- j
ship in Cap and Gown automatic
rather than elective.
An amendment passed last week j
would make leaders in certain cam
pus activities automatic members, :
1 revising the system whereby the ba- \
I sis of selection was, theoretically,
achievement, scholarship, and atti
tude. Opposition from . alumnae i
caused the amendment to be held
over for further consideration.
Leaders in Move
Leaders of the movement, Babe j
Dear, Jeanne Millard, Barbara Binns,
and Mary-Katherine Morris felt that j
the petty politics resorted to in elec
| tion of members and the lack of
| action of the organization and the j
jfalse ideals of personal distinction ,
; were undesirable in a senior,
I women's honorary body.
Instead, the proposed to substi
! tute art organization of accepted j
campus leaders who could poin in
discussion of common campus prob
lems.
Membership List
Membership would be drawn from
a tentative list composed of the
presidencies of A.W.S., W.A.A., Pan-
Hellenic, Y.W.C.A.. Women's editor
of the Daily and Quad, head spon-
I sor, and presidents of Roble and the
j Union unit.
Those opposed to this movement
j feel that Cap and Gown is an es
! tablished tradition on the campus,
j the purpose of which is social con
! tact between selected present and
former leaders.
Definite action will be taken with
in the next few days.
