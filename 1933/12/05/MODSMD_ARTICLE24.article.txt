# Cast Set for German Play
## 
### 
' In the Little Theatre, tomorrow
! night, the German Players of Stan
! ford University will present "Das
Apostelspiel," by the renowned Aus
trian dramatist and historian, Max
Mell. Members of the cast are:
Llewellyn McKay, Henry C. Lind
gren, Adolph Zech, and Isabel R.
Howell, and their director is artful
Kurt F. Reinhardt, associate profes
sor of German at Stanford.
The drama, set in the frame of a
starry winter night high up in the
; Alpine ravines of Steiermark, has
I often been compared with a fairy
j tale. The play is in a way foreign
to the world and yet, at the same
time it is closest to reality.
It is a tale of a child who lives
â€¢ with her grandfather high up in the
Austrian Alps. One day in a snow
storm, two strangers appear who
i bear the names, Peter and John. The
child, thinking them the Apostles,
! asks them about everything in their
jlife at the time of Christ.
I The end of the drama reveals the
winner in the conflict between the
faith of a simple child and the so
cialist gospel of the two agitators.
