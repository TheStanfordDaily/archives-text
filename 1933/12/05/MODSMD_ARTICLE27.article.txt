# Columbia Will Meet Stanford in Annual Rose Bowl Contest
## Ten Days of Doubt Ended as Masters Phones News Of Acceptance from Pasadena; Only Blot on Lions' Record Is Tigers' Early Season Win 
### 
Ending ten days of frenzied conjecture by press and public alike,
Columbia University, touted as one of the strongest football teams in the
East, yesterday accepted Stanford's invitation to play in the Pasadena Rose-
Bowl on New Year's Day.
Inciting mixed emotions of surprise and satisfaction, the announcement
was telephoned to Stanford by Al Masters, who received the acceptance in
Pasadena. Interest in the possibility of acceptancc by Michigan, Army, or
Princeton, had obscured the candidacy of Columbia, although recent ru
mors had prepared many fans for the choice.

► Suffering an early-season 20 to 0
.setback at the hand.s of Princeton's
great sophomore eleven, Columbia
staged a whirlwind comeback that
has netted a season's record of .seven
wins and one defeat and which
places the Lions on a par with Army
and Princeton in the opinion of most
Eastern sports experts.
Princeton Upset
After the Princeton upset, Coach
Lou Little's men swept through all
opposition, gaining successive vic
tories at the expense of Penn State,
Cornell, Navy, Lafayette, and Syra
cuse. Perhaps most impressive was
i Columbia's 15 to 7 victory over Navy,
j in which the Lions rolled up 15 first
! downs and 317 yards to three first
downs and 91 yards for the Midship-
I men.
Navy's lone touchdown came while
the Columbia reserves were in the
game. Close and hardfought con
tests with Army and Princeton
stamp Navy as a powerful team, giv
! ing some idea of the class of the
New Yorkers who defeated the
Academy so decisively.
Columbia Improved
With Lou Little taking over the
' coaching reins four years ago, Co
lumbia has improved rapidly, soar
ing toward the pinnacle it once oc
cupied in the Eastern football world.
I Since 1930, the Lions have won 2G
games, lost seven, and tied two. One;
defeat by Cornell in 1931, one by
i Brown in 1932, and the one by
Princeton this year are the only set
backs the Blue and White have had
since Little's first season.
Chief star for Columbia is Cap
tain ClifT Montgomery, 165-pound
i all-Eastern quarterback. Montgom
ery received his prep training at
Kiski, alma mater of Jim Moscrip
' and Bob Hamilton, as well as many
| other nation-wide collegiate stars.

great sophomore eleven, Columbia
staged a whirlwind comeback that
has netted a season's record of .seven
wins and one defeat and which
places the Lions on a par with Army
and Princeton in the opinion of most
Eastern sports experts.
Princeton Upset
After the Princeton upset, Coach
Lou Little's men swept through all
opposition, gaining successive vic
tories at the expense of Penn State,
Cornell, Navy, Lafayette, and Syra
cuse. Perhaps most impressive was
i Columbia's 15 to 7 victory over Navy,
j in which the Lions rolled up 15 first
! downs and 317 yards to three first
downs and 91 yards for the Midship-
I men.
Navy's lone touchdown came while
the Columbia reserves were in the
game. Close and hardfought con
tests with Army and Princeton
stamp Navy as a powerful team, giv
! ing some idea of the class of the
New Yorkers who defeated the
Academy so decisively.
Columbia Improved
With Lou Little taking over the
' coaching reins four years ago, Co
lumbia has improved rapidly, soar
ing toward the pinnacle it once oc
cupied in the Eastern football world.
I Since 1930, the Lions have won 2G
games, lost seven, and tied two. One;
defeat by Cornell in 1931, one by
i Brown in 1932, and the one by
Princeton this year are the only set
backs the Blue and White have had
since Little's first season.
Chief star for Columbia is Cap
tain ClifT Montgomery, 165-pound
i all-Eastern quarterback. Montgom
ery received his prep training at
Kiski, alma mater of Jim Moscrip
' and Bob Hamilton, as well as many
| other nation-wide collegiate stars.
Ending ten days of frenzied conjecture by press and public alike,
Columbia University, touted as one of the strongest football teams in the
East, yesterday accepted Stanford's invitation to play in the Pasadena Rose-
Bowl on New Year's Day.
Inciting mixed emotions of surprise and satisfaction, the announcement
was telephoned to Stanford by Al Masters, who received the acceptance in
Pasadena. Interest in the possibility of acceptancc by Michigan, Army, or
Princeton, had obscured the candidacy of Columbia, although recent ru
mors had prepared many fans for the choice.
