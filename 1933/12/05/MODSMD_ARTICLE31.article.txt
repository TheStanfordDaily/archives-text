# This Bawl-Out- Thing
## 
### 
'I lie biggest argument in favor of the Bawl-Out is that
we have had one for Ki years. And obviously, that is no
argument at all but rather a statement of historical fact.
It is also mentioned that records are kept clear by the
Bawl-Out, hut let it be clarified that in abolishing the Bawl-
Out, the Daily does not advocate tearing up the files in
the Registrar's Office. We would let them have their files.
Auv student who began worrying whether he was being
wronged by the keepers of the grades could inquire, be
answered; the records could be clarified.
The big thing, however, is that the student interested
would clear the problem, not all his friends and neighbors.
When the Daily advocates that a determined boot be
applied to the posterior of the Bawl-Out, we refer only to
that column dealing with grades." All other information,
including, and in fact especially, sorority phone numbers
can appear. Whether freshmen are masquerading as soph
omores can be revcacld. (But why they would want to, is
not very clear.)
The only nefarious element between those innocent
brown covers, as we attempted to show yesterday, is the
grade column. The calendar, the phone numbers, the ad
dresses of the trustees, the lire whistles- all are excellent.
Only the practice of printing grades is annoying.
If the students demand the abolition, the Administra
tion will probably listen. It behooves the students to de
mand. It is for their protection and comfort that the Daily
advocates abolition—or is repeal a more modern expres
sion intimating immediate and absolute death?
Professors and readers who lack the ability or courage
to judge students independently favor this Bawl-Out thing.
Positive arguments in its favor are lacking.
The Bawl-Out must go.
