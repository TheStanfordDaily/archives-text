# Boxing as It Should Be
## 
### 
The boxing tournament this evening is sport as it should
be. II is exciting but clean. It is clean because Coach
Harry Maloney keeps it clean. He sets a high plane for the
sport and tries to keep tlie contestants and the spectators
on that level. Of course, il is more difficult to attain the
latter than the former.
Oldsters look forward to these encounters. Newcomers
have a treat in store.
