What kind of burial is in store for prohibition? Today
il breathes its last, and tomorrow begins a period of per
haps greater drinking chaos than under the lXlli amend
ment.
For the last few years America at least knew where il
stood. (Often, at a speak-easv bar.) Now the confusing
and contradictory laws of slate and nation will make it
practically necessary to take a lawyer along every time
you want a drink. Now that college youth has learned how
to act under prohibition, we must start all over and learn
how lo act under supervised'liberty.
The difference seems to be that we have to learn to
drink less like college students and more like gentlemen,
and that liquor will be more expensive, and more danger
ous to drink in public. The curious result of prohibition
repeal in California is that il will be harder to buy a drink
than before.
We do not agree with the wets that repeal will solve
all the problems of the country. Nor do we agree with the
drys that the country has gone to the devil. Hut we do
think that tin* present situation is typically American:
wishy-washy, contradictory, and bound with legal red tape.
