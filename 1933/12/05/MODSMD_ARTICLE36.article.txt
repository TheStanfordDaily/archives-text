## LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF GRADES 
### 
Now that the repeal of Bawl-Out
averages seems well along the way,
we may juggle with that now fa
mous query: "After Repeal, What?"
Doubtless it will be wonderful to
thumb our mental noses at Ihe
hordes of stooges who grade papers.
Doubtless it will give the campus a
new feeling of exhilaration when it
becomes the rule, that a man's
grades, like his halitosis, should be
kept to himself. But why let that
new-born thrill confine itself to
gloating over the* demise of the
"plus hundreds" and the "minus
tens?" Why not make the feeling
one of real exalted ecstacy? ABOL
ISH GRADES ENTIRELY.
The story of grades is that the
student should have something to
show lor his scholastic gymnastics
—besides an education. The good:
they are rewarded, and the bad:
they are punished. The diligent, not
necessarily the intelligent, must have
a certificate of noble work accom
plished. The indolent, not neces
sarily the stupid, must forever be
branded with the searing, tell-tale
"D's" and worse.
The system is based on three very
shallow propositions: (1) Everyone
must be educated; (2) the University
is the guardian of the student, must
drive him into study; (3) grades are
a goal.
The ridiculous notion that every
man must have—besides life and lib
erty—an education is an American
one. It springs from the mechanical
womb of the machine age and the
misguided soul of democracy. Mass
production is a good thing in the
factory; therefore mass production
must be a good thing in the school.
Everyone can breathe; therefore
everyone can be educated. Everyone
must have a Ford; everyone must
have a sheepskin.
But some people are obviously un
fit for higher learning, just as some
people are unfit for artistry or car
pentry. For many the hammer and
tongs are much more suitable than
the pen and pencil. To demand di-

! plomas of potential mechanics is lit
tle short of criminal.
From this mass-education obses
sion has followed another factory
ideal: absolute watchfulness over
the progress of the product. The
factory foreman is responsible for
every auto having its coat of paint;
so the University president is held
up to censure if every one of his
charges does not have his coating of
education. Consequently, professors
, and administrators must .stand Si
mon Legree-like, glowering down
on the slaves of the educational
1 mills. They must deliver grade
lathings to those who fall behind;
they must hold the grade-goal be
fore the eyes of their sweating
' charges.
The fallacy of the whole system,
the point at where the process of
education departs from the factory
analogy, is that educated beings—
unlike Fords and Packards—are liv
ing things; and education—unlike
the manufacturing process—should
be a subjective thing. If the indi
vidual wants an education, let him
get one; but do not interpose false
goads or obstacles between him and
his goal.
j do not make people learn
| —which is the ultimate object; they
make him study—which is momen
tary, mechanical procedure. The
"education" which grades cram
; down the academic throat is not the
education that brings progress.
