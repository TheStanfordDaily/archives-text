## DEMOCRACY DEMANDED SAN JOSE MOB MURDER? 
### 
The Edilor, Sir:
i This is not a defense of Jimmy
Rolph!
j It is a defense of the rights of the
American people and an attempt to
, show that there is another side.
We hate to do it but we are going
| to drag out the old much-satirized,
! seemingly ludicrous, laughable, bro
i midic gag, "Of the people, by the
' people, and for the people."
Snicker and sneer all you like, it
| is still the basic element in our safe
and sound democratic nation.
The Law, contrary to the use and
' procedure it has assumed during the
i past few years, is not a hammer to
| be held by the select few with which
| to drive discriminatory nails that
will bring votes. Nor is if a Great
' God Jehovah to whom the people
I must humbly bow, revere and never
i criticize. It is not a loud mouth thai
i demands "What is the Law?" to
' which the people respond in unison,
"Spill no Blood."
The Law is the will of the people.
The people are the ones who de
j termine what is in accordance with
: social routine —not a proletariat of
; elected and appointed group of self
; made, everyday, god-fearing numb
-1 skulls who happen to have had their
ego inflated by a little authority.
The lynch mob demonstration was
a definite move of the people, not
"to take the law into its own hands,"
| but to bring it back to its rightful
heritage.
Too long has the legal faction
! shillyshallied through bribe, cow
ardice, and stupidity. Justice has
j been prostituted by blundering in
effectual judges and juries, and art
ful lawyers.
. Ten thousand people and the
greater majority of San Jose wanted
• swift justice. They go it. That was
the law.
The interference of Governor
Rolph would have done either of
J two things. It would have massa-
I cred a number of innocent people
and forced them to permit the exe-
I cution of something with which
. j they did not agree (also wrong).
■ ! The lynching at San Jose was not
I ( a bestial, primitive display, a throw
; , back on civilization. It was quite
isane. Quite rational. The people

waited until the discovery of Brooke
Hart's body confirmed unquestion
ably, the guilt of two ghastly cow
ards. San Jose is again a quiet, j
peaceful town of American citizens, 1
not a mob of barbarians run amuck. 1
The statements of Hart's father in
not wishing to sanction a lynching
proves nothing. For a man of his !
position to openly voice any other
opinions would be absurd.
Those who demand Rolph's res
ignation on this point had better '
turn to Sunday School teaching, j
Some of them are using his attitude
on lynching as a means of attacking ;
him for other political actions which i
is\ unfair.
Rolph is to be admired for having
the courage to stand up for his be
liefs, a quality decidedly lacking in j
many of his well-known fence- j
straddling critics.
Human life is evidently very tri
vial. The affair is finished. We sug
gest it be dropped.
If the people had not distrusted ■
the weary, long drawn out, yellow- j
taped procedure of the courts, thi.s j
thing would never have happened, i
