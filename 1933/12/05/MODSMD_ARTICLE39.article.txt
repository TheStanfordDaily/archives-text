The Editor, Sir:
! Allow me to censure you in your j
! thoughtlessness in not giving to our
returning dehators, Messrs. Wood- j
bury and Grantier, a burst of praise
in your editorial columns.
Their feat was certainly praise- j
worthyâ€”selling the U.S. short in
that dear old U.S.A. is the cause of j
the World's Economic and Political ;
ills, and imagine securing from those
skeptical Canadian judges a unani
i nous decision as to the veracity of
i their position.
The breath taking enormity of
foisting such a concept upon an un
i willing world is certainly a Gargan
: tuan task for any patriot of the land
| of freedom to essay.
i I hope, Abe, you will cringe and
i hide your shame in sackcloth and |
j ashes for months to come as the
only fitting penance for your horri
ble oversight.
God Save the King,
I Ed Boyles.

Deau Mary Yost will nol be "at
home" on Wednesday afternoon of
