Of all the aspects of football, the
most fertile field for the carping
critics is the annual naming of all-
American or all-Coast or a 11-Pea
nut Avenue teams. This column is
utterly opposed to the business,
principally because of the common
practice of bartering a tackle in the
Northwest for a halfback from the
Big Ten, or the swapping by Coach
Ppffft of his demon defensive cen
ter for Coach Jarbrain's wobble
kneed right end. This log-rolling
sort of thing certainly does not lead
to the selection of a representative
team.
We strongly suspect, anyway, that
there are few observers who can sit
down, scrutinize the play of two
guards, and immediately tell you
that one man is much better than
the other. When the subjects under
survey are men already somewhat
distinguished for their ability, the
problem becomes doubly hard.
Further, no one nominating candi
dates for "All" teams has the ad
vantage of seeing all the men in ac
tion; one relies on the testimony of
others, and the whole px'ocess of se
lection arrives at a hap-hazard state
of guesswork.
We all enjoy scribbling on blank
scraps of paper at odd moments,
however, putting down our choice
of a mythical wonder team. It is
an indoor pastime that has achieved
importance comparable to the cross
word puzzle and other doings of that
ilk. The Daily sports reporters en
joy such antics as much as anyone;
moreover, they have the dubious ad
vantage of publishing their opinions
and thus Inflicting them on others.
So with this lengthy introduction
we give you the Stanford Daily's
football squad. It is not all-Coast,
or all-Conference, but just a squad
of 22. To nominate a man for it,
the writer must have observed him
in action. He might have been play
ing on a high school 110-pound team,
or the Green Bay Packers, but he
must have been seen, playing foot
ball sometime this season.
Naturally, because we have seen
more Stanford games, Stanford play
ers get advantage in the choices.
This is the weak spot in our method
of selection.

football squad. It is not all-Coast,
or all-Conference, but just a squad
of 22. To nominate a man for it,
the writer must have observed him
in action. He might have been play
ing on a high school 110-pound team,
or the Green Bay Packers, but he
must have been seen, playing foot
ball sometime this season.
Naturally, because we have seen
more Stanford games, Stanford play
ers get advantage in the choices.
This is the weak spot in our method
of selection.
