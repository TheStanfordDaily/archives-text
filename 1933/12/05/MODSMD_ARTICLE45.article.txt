# MURAL GRID FINALS PLAYED OFF TODAY
## 
### 
I In a last mad scramble for the
i intramural football championship,
! Sigma Nu and A.T.O. meet this af
' ternoon at 3:15 o'clock to decide
| which is the better team.
j Both have come through their rc
j spective leagues, and in addition
; have eliminated two opponents in
j the play-offs.
A.T.O. is depending on the com
j bination of Ray Forsythe and Ernie
I Arbuckle to furnish the points nec
essary for a victoi-y. Forsythe's
] passes to Arbuckle have been out
i standing during the season. Louis
| Fhelps is the main cog in the de
i fense. Others who will probably go
into action for A.T.O. tomorrow are:
Frank Springer, Charles Parker, and
j Henry Dahleen.
j Sigma Nu success has been due to
I good team work and co-operation
! among the players. Bud Shreve, Ted
j Leidig, Jim Mullen, and Howard
Buller have played outstanding foot
ball in various games, and with them
today will start Dick Linden, Louis
j Bansback, and Dick Head.
