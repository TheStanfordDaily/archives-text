Coach John Bunn has been busy
rounding off fall *basketball practice
i in preparation for the fast-approach
ing casuba season. Short on expe
rienced veterans but with plenty of
material, Bunn has hopes of turning
' out a polished quintet by the time
the first practice games roll around
j the last of this month.
Captain Hal Edelen is the only
letterman out for practice at pres
ent since Keith Topping, ace for
ward from last year, will be busy
with football until after the New
i Year's Day game. Other members
from last year's squad include Char
ley Rogers and A1 Page.

varsity two years ago, has returned
to school as has Herb Jenkins, for
| mer members of the squad. Gordy
Mallatratt, stellar guard on the frosh
j quintet two years ago, has shown
lup well in practice, holding down
j a first-string berth at present,
i From last year's freshman team
1 comes Ken Nobs, lanky center, to
j help out at the pivot job. Don
i Greenlee, first-string center on last
(year's frosh, will not be eligible for
the 1934 season, not having been in
; school for sufficient quarters. Dave
Farber, team-mate of Greenlee and
lan outstanding guard, is also out for
the varsity.
