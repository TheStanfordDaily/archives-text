In order to discover material for 1
his freshman swimming team, Coach ;
Nort Thornton put up a cup at the
beginning of the year to be awarded !
to the man who individually made
the most points in regulation fresh- I
man tank races.
Won by Don Peterson, the cup
competition revealed to crafty j
Thornton four finds—Jack Scharlin i
in the breast stroke, Ben Voss in |
the backstroke, and Bob Hoover, I
Aleck McKenzie in the crawl.
Urging all frosh to take part in
each event, Thornton discovered that '
Voss, who thought he was a dis- i
tance ace, is the best backstroke I
prospect in years. Ben's easy stroke ;
and steady speed in this event spot- I
ted him as a comer.
Bob Hoover was convinced that
ho was a sprint man, but in the ;
trials he proved to be an expert long j
distance swimmer.
Aleck McKenzie believed himself
to be a distance man, but he turned |
out to be a promising tandidate for j
a sprint berth in the crawl event.
Jack Scharlin, erstwhile freshman !
goalie on the water polo team, had i
no idea what he did best, and came >
home with a mark of 1:22 in the j
100-yard breaststroke race.
The star-producing cup was given

by an anonymous donor. The point
totals in the competition were Pe
terson, 18; Martin Scatena, 0; Bob
Hoover, 7; and Aleek McKenzie; 6.
Cup-winner Peterson proved to be
an all-around paddler, winning the
220, 440; placed second in the 100,
third in the 50—all crawl events—
and third in the backstroke.

have been tacked on trees at the
University of Oregon. '"Scoliosis to
