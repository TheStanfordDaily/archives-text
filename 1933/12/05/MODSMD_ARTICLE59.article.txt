# Town Celebrates Wine Shipment
## 
### 

The entire tiny town of Asti, Cul., location of one of the world's largest
wineries, turned out en masse the other day when the first large ship
ment of wine in 10, these many years, rolled eastward to quench the
thirst of palates after Dee. 5. Pictured above is the scene at the rail
road station where the vintage flowed freely.
