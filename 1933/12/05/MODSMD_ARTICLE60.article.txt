# MALONEY INVITES NEW WOMEN TO BOXING TOURNAMENT; 500 ALWAYS ADDED FLAVOR
## 
### 
Nice girls and boxing matches?
Emily Post may not endorse it us
the thing to do, but Stanford coeds
have made it traditional to drop
their demureness and turn out in
large numbers to see Farm pugilists
in action.
The women hail boxing as "thril
ling, stimulating, and different," and
their enthusiasm indicates that it is
destined to take second place to
football in popularity.
Minor sports coach, Harry Ma
loney, extends a genial invitation to
the annual novice boxing tourna
ment being staged tonight at the Pa
vilion by the Circle S Society.
"We want all the girls to come,"
said he. "It's just a family affair,
and we guarantee that there will
be plenty of excitement and clean
sportsmanship."
Maloney likes to see feminine
spectators at the matches, and says
they are nof too noisy and seem
genuinely interested in the sport.
He reveals that about 35 per cent
of the audience in the past has been
made up of Stanford women, and
hopes that the new "800" will be
equally "boxing conscious" and flock
to the battles of beef and brawn.
The popularity of the sport among
women has been attributed to the
historical desire of the fair sex to
see their men in display of strength

and courage. The modern girl, in
going to a boxing match, is not doing
anything new, sociologists point out,
but is merely reacting to the same
desire that prompted the medieval
maid to witness tournaments be
tween gallant knights.
