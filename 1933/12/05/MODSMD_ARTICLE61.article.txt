LITTLE WOMEN (RKO)
At the Golden Gate Theatre
There is a good deal of unvar
nished homeliness and straightfor
ward emotion in this adaptation of
the Alcott classic which might pro
vide mirth for the pseudo-sophisti
cate, and thus it is earnestly hoped
that such individuals will remain at
home with their "Ballyhoo," and
leave the film for those who will ap
preciate its mood.
The film is so superbly exeouted
in every particular that it is diffi
cult to single out any department
for special praise. With G. B.
Stern's astonishingly faithful scena
rio as a basis, Director George Cu
kor has handled the piece with rare
skill and understanding. Radiantly
beautiful as a whole, the picture is
notably splendid in the more inti
mate scenes dealing with the March
family life.
I have never seen a picture so per
fectly cast. The characters of the
story, so far removed from present
day life, are consistently real and
strikingly vivid, at no time appear
ing laughably old-fashioned. Almost
every one of the Alcott characters
is interpreted by a performer of es
tablished reputation and personality,
and it is a tribute to the sincerity of
the film that in every instance they
thoroughly submerge themselves in
their characters.
The amazing Katharine Hepburn
does the most brilliant work of her
career in the role of Jo. This is the
first filial in which she has not com
pletely unbalanced the story in her
favor, and it is a tribute to her ar
tistry that she plays Jo with such
restraint as not to distort the con
sumate effect. That is not to be
little her work in any way: for it is
a magnificiently real. Here is an ac
tress who creates character, vital,
sincere, and infinitely touching.
Joan Bennett is especially excel
lent in her earlier sequences as
Amy; she is charming and natural;
but after she gets her man, she seems
to recall she is a Bennett. Frances
Dee and Jean Parker as the other
two sisters are superb, the former
in restraint and the latter in pathos.
Edna May Oliver's Aunt March
is her best performance to date, and
the same may be said of Henry Ste
phenson's Mr. Lawrence. Douglass
Montgomery makes a sincere and in
genous Laurie, and Seth Byington
is splendid as Mrs. March.
Paul Lukas, at last rescued from

the limbo of spineless heroes, turns
in an admirable performance as the

professor. One would like to see him I
in the Franz Schubert role of "Bios- |
som Time." ' â€”Chapin |
