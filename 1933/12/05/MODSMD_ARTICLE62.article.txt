# GRID CONNECTIONS SEVERED BETWEEN BRONCS AND GAELS
## 
### SPUD HAMILTON 
Severance of all athletic relations
between S # . Mary's and Santa Clara
became a fact yesterday with the
announcement coming from Rev.
James J. Lyons, S.J., president of
the University of Santa Clara. The
break occurred following statements
asserted to have been made by
"Clipper" Smith, Santa Clara coach,
after the St. Mary's Sunla Clara
game this year.
Thus the Broncos were added to
the growing list of schools shying
from gridiron competition with the
Marauding Moragans of St. Mary's,
coachcd by "Slip" Madigan. South
ern California soon after their 14-
7 triumph over the Gaels declared
their intention of scheduling no
games next year.
Last week the rumor was preva
lent that Stanford authorities had
reversed an earlier decision to play
St. Mary's next year. Based on a
story written by William Leiser, San
Francisco sports writer who usually
keeps a close ear to the Stanford
Board of Athletic Control, the ru
mor appeared to be tacitly accepted
as true by all concerned.
St. Mary's authorities maintain a
poker face and declare that they
have no worries over the athletic
wolf at the door. They intimated
that they have a number of promi
nent Eastern universities bidding
for an engagement with the Gal
loping Gaels, "the Coast's biggest
and best," and that next year's
schedule looks very rosy.
Despite this, Coach Madigan and
Graduate Manager Louis Lefevre
made a hurried trip to Los Angeles
last week with the ostensible motive
of obtaining a game with the Tro
jans. Willis Hunter, director of ath
letics at S.C., quashed any Gael
hopes in that quarter.
