# Registrar Justifies Use of Grade Points With Farm Bawlout
## Directory Is Convenience To Administration And Faculty DAILY PROBES FACULTY Continuation of System Up To Studentsâ€”Yost 
### Frank Moore 
| Publication of grade point aver-
I ages in the Bawlout is justified be
cause it keeps the records straight,
in the opinion of Registrar J. P.
Mitchell. It is not justified if a suf
ficient number of students object to
the practice, in the opinion of Dean
of Women Mary Yost. Both com
ments were solicited yesterday after
the Daily editorial condemning
grade points had appeared.
Placing personal feelings before
administrative convenience, Dean
Yost said, "The directory as pub
[ lished now may be and often is a
convenience to administrative offi
cers and the faculty, but I think
that if a sufficient number of stu
dents do not want their grade points
published, the directory should not
include the information.
Whose Business?
"His grade point average is the
individual student's business and
not that of his fellow students."
Registrar Mitchell took the view
point which is necessary in his of
fice, namely, that the record is kept
! clear and straight not only for the
! convenience of Stanford offices, but
| for the convenience of the individ-
I ual students as well.
[ Although not wishing to make a
[direct statement for quotation, Reg
istrar Mitchell indicated that his at
| titude toward the student directory
dates back to his undergraduate days
in 1901 when for the first time, the
number of hours each student had
gained was published. Many stu
dents were parading as seniors or
juniors whereas they were only
lower division students.
A Regular "Bawlout"
The directory literally "bawled
out" those claiming grade ratings
! under false pretenses and generally
! clarified local questions of "who
| stands where?" Today, it gives sim
[ ilar information to fraternities and
i honor societies which must know the
) grade point standing of certain un-
I dergraduates.
Dean Yost agreed that addresses
and the number of hours each stu
dent has gained should be published.
Both administrators were inclined
to discount the Daily editorial charge
that readers and professors are sub
stantially influenced in grading by
the past performance of students as
| shown in the Student Directory.
As to the effect on the scholastic
j morale created by publishing grade
points, the registrar said he was un
certain but felt the effect was not
great. Dean Yost did not comment
on this point.
Started in 1920
The practice of publishing grade
[ points was started in 1920, 19 years
| after the hours gained were first
j published. Thirteen years has not
| established the custom with such
| solidity that an earthquake is nec
; essary to shake it down, the dean
j remarked.

dates back to his undergraduate days
in 1901 when for the first time, the
number of hours each student had
gained was published. Many stu

A Regular "Bawlout"

i honor societies which must know the

I dergraduates.
Dean Yost agreed that addresses
and the number of hours each stu
dent has gained should be published.
Both administrators were inclined
to discount the Daily editorial charge
that readers and professors are sub
stantially influenced in grading by
the past performance of students as

As to the effect on the scholastic
j morale created by publishing grade
points, the registrar said he was un
certain but felt the effect was not
great. Dean Yost did not comment
on this point.

I ages in the Bawlout is justified be

Mitchell. It is not justified if a suf
ficient number of students object to
the practice, in the opinion of Dean
of Women Mary Yost. Both com
ments were solicited yesterday after
the Daily editorial condemning
grade points had appeared.
Placing personal feelings before
administrative convenience, Dean
Yost said, "The directory as pub
[ lished now may be and often is a
convenience to administrative offi
cers and the faculty, but I think
that if a sufficient number of stu
dents do not want their grade points
published, the directory should not
include the information.
Whose Business?
"His grade point average is the
individual student's business and
not that of his fellow students."

point which is necessary in his of
