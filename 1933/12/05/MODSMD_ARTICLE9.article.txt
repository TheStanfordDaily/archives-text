# Rebates Not To Be Given To Students
## Balance Sheet Reveals Bookstore Losses 
### 
Patronisers of the Stanford Book
store last year will receive no re
bates, a statement issued yesterday
by the board of directors disclosed.
A survey of the store's balance
sheet for the 1932-33 term showed a
net loss of more than $6,000. Sales
last year suffered a 26 per cent re
duction. Officials said the cut in vol
ume was due to the reduction in the
number of students registered in the
University and the smaller purchas
ing power of both students and in
structors.
Rebates Have Been Paid
Rebates totaling as high as 10 per
cent have been paid during pros
perous years, it was pointed out in
the report.
The report, submitted by E. P.
Lesley, president of the stockholders,
stated total sales for the year ending
August 31, 1933, amounted to $107,-
349.78, compared to 1932 intake of
3145,235.64 and 1931 sales of $170,-
359.03.
Loss of $1,821.86
The directors' report said various
economies, including salary slashes,
failed to compensate for the drastic
drop in sales. The total loss for last
year was 36,211.31; 1932 loss was
$1,821.86.
The sales volume for September
and October of this year are ap
proximately the same as for the cor
responding months last year. The
directors indicated a rebate for this
year was improbable unless sales in
crease materially.
