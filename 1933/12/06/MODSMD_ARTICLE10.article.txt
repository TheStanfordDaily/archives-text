Tough Competition
The toughest competition in the j
semi-final round came in the light- ;
weight, welterweight, and junior- ,
middleweight divisions. Probably
the closest decision of the evening
gave Bill Sullivan a win over Randy J
Hill in the welterweight class. Dick
Van Wagenen came back from a
knock-down to win from Peirce Mc-
Dowell in the most spectacular j
semi-final match.
Cabby Caballero came through in j
a hard-fought final match against j
Ralph Purdy that was stopped by,
the referee in the third round. Frank
Ingersoll showed plenty of power j
when he cut his final light-heavy- '
weight bout with Fd Fisher short j
with the only knockout of the eve- ]
ning.
Frank Bowles showed a good ;
brand of boxing to win a close de
cision from his lightweight opponent !
Lyman Breed. The fight was a tough
one with Bowles on the aggressive ,
most of the time.
Joe Rea and Randy Hill furnished
the new champion, Bill Sullivan,
with plenty of opposition in the wel
terweight division. In the final bout
Sullivan charged in to break through
Rea's defense for a decision.
Dick Van Wagenen after getting
off to a slow start in his first bout ;
came through in good shape to de- j
feat Colin McCorriston. Bob Moore,
a newcomer on the Farm, showed a
lot of strength to win from Tom
Collins. Ralph Mac Michael took the
heavyweight title in a decisive win
over Jim Kellogg.
