# Cap and Gowners Faced By Three Resignations
## 
### Annalee Whitmore 
Tending resignations which Cap j
and Gown refused to accept, three j
erstwhile members last night found
themselves in the predicament of
belonging to a society whose prin
ciples they did not endorse, and !
whose foundation they considered i
unsound.
Babe Dear, W.A.A. president;
Jeanne Millard, head of A.W.S., and,
Mary-K. Morris, former A.W.S.
president, backed a proposal, sub- i
mitted last week, of automatic mem- J
bership, which was incorporated in j
the constitution of the society.
Grads Protest
Aroused alumnae protested. They 1
upheld the tradition of 25 years, i
policies of past and gone days. Ac
tive members grew dubious.
Result: Reconsideration at last
night's meeting, with results as
stated above.
Ten Cap and Gowners, anxious to
conciliate both factions but with no I
clear-cut policy, suggested (hat the j
constitution bo waived for a period j
of one year, during which the in- J
novation of automatic membership ;
would be tried. Neither group con
sidered the move a definite solution 1
of the difficulty.
Outline Status Quo
The situation at present, compli- ;
cated by the adoption of the amend- '
ment: Amendment in constitution, |
but opposed by Cap and Gown; 1
three conscientious objectors, op
posed to the entire formation of the j
society, withdrawing; and their res
ignations, not accepted, yet to be!
considered.
The plan as advanced last week |
altered entrance requirements of the
society, making holders of specified
offices automatically members, and
eliminating the personality of voting i
as conducted at present. Their goal:
to make of the group a forum of in- j
terested alumni and student leaders. I
Dear Comments
"In all fairness to ourselves and,
the organization, we feel that we
cannot retain membership in a so
ciety so vitally opposed to our prin
cilpcs—a society which has only a ;
social and emotional purpose," says |
Babe Dear, last week president of i
the society.
Jeanne Millard, agreeing, states: j
"The purpose of Cap and Gown is '
to further the ideals of Stanford j
women. Actually, the aim has been j
the preservation alter college of the j
aura of superiority surrounding stu- j
dent leaders. This aim, gowned in
sentimentality and capped with in- j
tangible ideals, I consider unwhole- j
rome."
Anna Louise Aynesworth and
Louise Hudson, representing the op
position yet retaining membership,
refused to comment. "It is a matter
for group action. We as individuals
have no right to make any state
| ment upon the matter."

the organization, we feel that we
cannot retain membership in a so
ciety so vitally opposed to our prin
cilpcs—a society which has only a ;
social and emotional purpose," says |
Babe Dear, last week president of i
the society.
Jeanne Millard, agreeing, states: j
"The purpose of Cap and Gown is '
to further the ideals of Stanford j
women. Actually, the aim has been j
the preservation alter college of the j
aura of superiority surrounding stu- j
dent leaders. This aim, gowned in
sentimentality and capped with in- j
tangible ideals, I consider unwhole- j
rome."
Anna Louise Aynesworth and
Louise Hudson, representing the op
position yet retaining membership,
refused to comment. "It is a matter
for group action. We as individuals
have no right to make any state
| ment upon the matter."
Tending resignations which Cap j
and Gown refused to accept, three j
erstwhile members last night found
themselves in the predicament of
belonging to a society whose prin
ciples they did not endorse, and !
whose foundation they considered i
unsound.
Babe Dear, W.A.A. president;
Jeanne Millard, head of A.W.S., and,
Mary-K. Morris, former A.W.S.
president, backed a proposal, sub- i
mitted last week, of automatic mem- J
bership, which was incorporated in j
the constitution of the society.
Grads Protest
Aroused alumnae protested. They 1
upheld the tradition of 25 years, i
policies of past and gone days. Ac
tive members grew dubious.
Result: Reconsideration at last
night's meeting, with results as
stated above.
Ten Cap and Gowners, anxious to
conciliate both factions but with no I
clear-cut policy, suggested (hat the j
constitution bo waived for a period j
of one year, during which the in- J
novation of automatic membership ;
would be tried. Neither group con
sidered the move a definite solution 1
of the difficulty.
Outline Status Quo
The situation at present, compli- ;
cated by the adoption of the amend- '
ment: Amendment in constitution, |
but opposed by Cap and Gown; 1
three conscientious objectors, op
posed to the entire formation of the j
society, withdrawing; and their res
ignations, not accepted, yet to be!
considered.
The plan as advanced last week |
altered entrance requirements of the
society, making holders of specified
offices automatically members, and
eliminating the personality of voting i
as conducted at present. Their goal:
to make of the group a forum of in- j
terested alumni and student leaders. I
