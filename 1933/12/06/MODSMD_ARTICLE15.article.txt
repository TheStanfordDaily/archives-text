# Plan Columbia Radio Debate
## Yale Forensic Squad Also Seeks Stanford Meet 
### 
Stanford meets Columbia in foot
ball, then debating. Impossible yes
terday, now feasible, this pipedream
today became actuality when Stan
ford debaters, represented by War
ded Duggan, debate manager, re
ceived letters yesterday from Yale
and Columbia Universities request
ing a radio meet next spring.
May Accept Both
Although no decision has been
reached by the Debate Council, ru
mor has it that at least one, and
probably both, offers will be ac
cepted. Columbia at present is more
favored and it is virtually certain
that they, at least, will meet the In
dians via the air sometime in April.
Yale has already made tentative
plans with the National Broad- .
casting Company for the use of
its facilities in March and it is
entirely possible that their offer
too may be accepted.
Several letters have been received
from various sources asking for
copies of the speeches delivered by
Van Wagenen and Rogers in the
Cambridge meet. These include a
request from Noble and Noble, pub
lishers of the Yearbook of College
Debating, for a copy to be included
in their new issue.
To Buy Radio
Professor Lee Emerson Bassett,
Stanford faculty member and presi
dent of the National Association of
Teachers of Speech, recently left for
New York where he is endeavoring
to get a radio set which can be used
for practice in preparing speeches.
