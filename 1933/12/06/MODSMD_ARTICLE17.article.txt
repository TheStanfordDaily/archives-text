# FACULTY LACKS REAL APPROVAL OF "BAWL-OUT"
## Many Hit Printing of Grade Records as Violating Students' Privacy 
### 
No decided approval of the pres
j ent system of printing grade point j
; records in the student directory was
i revealed by a canvas of professional:
opinion yesterday.
Student opposition strengthened J
by published opinions of Registrar)
Mitchell and Dean of Women Mary i
Yost has occasioned the following |
! statements from leading faculty j
members:
Professor of History E. E. Rob
inson: "I have never liked it and I
would be glad to see it eliminated.
It has never seemed to be properly
| a matter of public interest. I think
! it has a bad psychological influ
ence on the student."
Professor of Political Science E. A.
Cottrell: "I've be?n advocating the
i abolition of the grade points in the j
Bawl-out for years. I believe there
would be more students doing inde- !
pendent study work. A number of,
students would like to do independ- j
I ent study but don't want their record
published without the grade points
from independent work. I don't
think printing the grades is neces- !
j sary from any angle whatsoever.
"I think there is a good deal of 1
I comparison with Ihe Bawl-out by,
professors, especially when in doubt
of what kind of work a student is
doing. This is particularly true of !
younger men who are just beginning
jto give out grades. It is a crutch
i upon which they lean if in doubt, j
j Grades are nobody's business but the
student's own and the administra-
I tion's. The registrar's office can
i check to see if a student is eligible :
| for an office."
Professor of English W. D. Brigg.s: 1
I "I see no reason why there should |
be any change made in the Bawl- j
j out. I see no harm in keeping it the l
way it is."

j i 2 i ofessor ot Political Science Gra- \
| ham Stuart: "I am in favor of chang- j
: ing the Bawl-out and taking out j
j grade points. I think that the sys- l
j tern is convenient in many ways, 1
but it would be just a§ easy for the '
i registrar's office to furnish facts to
those who wish them, and the ex- I
pense would be no more than that of j
setting up and publishing the book. \
"In that way Ihe desirable fea- i
j tures can be accomplished without j
I destroying the student's privacy by i
! printing information for gossipers to j
j glean. I am inclined to be highly in ;
favor of changing the system omit- 1
; ing the grade points."
Professor of Biology C. V. Taylor:
;"I have discussed the matter with
| faculty men and haven't found any I
! definite reason why grades should
not be published. It would not be ,
j advisable to discontinue the prac- j
lice without further investigations <
; and good reasons.
"Printing grades in the Bawl
out has the same sort of c(Tect that
I giving grades has. I am opposed
! to grades in any form but we can't
do without them at the present
j lime. Our entire system is based
| oil thorn."
Associate Professor of Economics 1
E. D. Fagan: "I pay no attention in !
making out my grades as to what
j students have done in other courses.!
J The Bawl-out grades haven't in any
ica.se influenced the grades I have
| given in my classes. I have used
'them only in determining desirable!
independent study students. Whether !
or not it is desirable to have grades
I printed for other reasons I don't j
: know."
| Dean G. N. Kefauver, of the
School of Education: "I don't know
! whether the printing of grade points
! has any effect on what people do or
not. It is supposed to stimulate peo

where they stand.
"As a basis to select students of
i confidence for student leadership'
ilhero is no doubt in my mind as to'
(the desirability of informing people
jof their academic stat us. I'm not so

Omit Oracle Points
j i 2 i ofessor ot Political Science Gra- \
| ham Stuart: "I am in favor of chang- j
: ing the Bawl-out and taking out j
j grade points. I think that the sys- l
j tern is convenient in many ways, 1
but it would be just a§ easy for the '
i registrar's office to furnish facts to
those who wish them, and the ex- I
pense would be no more than that of j
setting up and publishing the book. \
"In that way Ihe desirable fea- i
j tures can be accomplished without j
I destroying the student's privacy by i
! printing information for gossipers to j
j glean. I am inclined to be highly in ;
favor of changing the system omit- 1
; ing the grade points."
Professor of Biology C. V. Taylor:
;"I have discussed the matter with
| faculty men and haven't found any I
! definite reason why grades should
not be published. It would not be ,
j advisable to discontinue the prac- j
lice without further investigations <
; and good reasons.
"Printing grades in the Bawl
out has the same sort of c(Tect that
I giving grades has. I am opposed
! to grades in any form but we can't
do without them at the present
j lime. Our entire system is based
| oil thorn."
Associate Professor of Economics 1
E. D. Fagan: "I pay no attention in !
making out my grades as to what
j students have done in other courses.!
J The Bawl-out grades haven't in any
ica.se influenced the grades I have
| given in my classes. I have used
'them only in determining desirable!
independent study students. Whether !
or not it is desirable to have grades
I printed for other reasons I don't j
: know."
| Dean G. N. Kefauver, of the
School of Education: "I don't know
! whether the printing of grade points
! has any effect on what people do or
not. It is supposed to stimulate peo
| pie to better work and inform them
where they stand.
"As a basis to select students of
i confidence for student leadership'
ilhero is no doubt in my mind as to'
(the desirability of informing people
jof their academic stat us. I'm not so
sure that it represents a desirable!
form of motivation. I have seen no ,
suggestion thaL professors' grading is
influenced by the Bawl-out. I have!
! not observed it if it exists."
