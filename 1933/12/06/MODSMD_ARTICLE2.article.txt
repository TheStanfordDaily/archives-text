Retiring Japanese Ambassador to
Ihe United States, Katsuji Debuchi,
yesterday referred to Hawaii as "the
first line" of Japanese-American re
lationships; said he was "thoroughly
convinced" of America's friendly at
titude toward Japan; branded as
"ridiculous" any notion that Amer
ica's recognition of Russia was ac
tuated by plans antagonistic to his
country.
