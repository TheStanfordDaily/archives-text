Approximately 2,250 invitations j
I have been sent out to entering 1
; women, Pan-Hellenic figures indi- j
; cate. Each house ihus delivered an '
I average of 250 invitations, with each I
new woman receiving an average of
j 5Vi of the "coveted" white paste-
I boards.
The teas, beginning today, will j
continue through , Sunday, hours
being from 3 until 6 o'clock daily, j
I Quad clothes arc in order for both
Greek women and ruslices, except
on Saturday and Sunday after
noons, when simple afternoon

"We are looking forward to a
! smooth running rushing season un
der the new rules," stated Pan-Hel
lenic President Mary Rath last night,
j "Stanford sororities have never had
rushing complicated by such a large

this year's program will work out
successfully for everyone con
