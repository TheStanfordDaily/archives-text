Tiles from Madrid, old windows !
from famous churches in Spain,
carefully selected stones from Car
mel, and columns from the Stanford ,
Quad, which were designed by Ve- I
netians, brought over by the Senator
and his wife, only to fall in the 190(1
earthquakeâ€”
All of these are going into the
home of their collector, Pedro de
Lemos, famous California artist, and
director of the Stanford Museum and
Art Gallery.
"It's a copy of my father's house [
in old Spain," explained the hand
some, silver-haired artist, 6f his
Palo Alto home, which nears com
pletion after four years of loving
labor on the part of its builder.
Designer of the Allied Arts in
Menlo Park, de Lemos has put into I
the building of this house all hi.,
love for authentic Spanish architec- |

[turc, supervising its construction!
with care for completeness of detail j
and a realistic interpretation of the |
j old Romanic style.
When finished the house promises
j to be the most extraordinary one of j
its type in this country. Built in Ihv
form of a quadrangle, its open court
J is paved with a stone mosaic, de- J
J signed and executed by Mrs. dn j
Lemos. The court also contains a
Roman entrance and a copy of a
Moorish granary, both typical of Iho i
' foreign influences to be found in
[ Spain.
De Lemos explains that the house
is being built around several old
chests which were brought to Palo
Alto from his father's home in Spain.
All of them are rare, and over a
i hundred years old. Outstanding is a
Moorish chest made in 1520 and in-
I laid with mother-of-pearl and ivory.
