# REPEAL BRINGS BEER AND WINE FOR PALO ALTO
## 3.2 Beverages Can Now Be Sold in Local Hotels And Restaurants ENFORCE 1.5 MILE LAW Union Still Sells Near Beer As Campus Stays Dry 
### Jay Graves 
Today the nation has hard liquor
| and Palo Alto has beer and wine!
! It's just 3.2, of course, but it's more
th;in thirsty Stanfordites have been
able to buy heretofore (in Palo
Alto).
Hard liquor, from Manhattan
cocktails and "demon rum" to "in
toxicating" beer is out, according to
City Attorney Arnold Rumwell, in
an opinion last night.
Limit Still Holds
"The one and a half mile clause
[still holds," he .says—at least insofar
| ;is the stiffer drinks are concerned,
jlt has been amended to exclude
j light wines and beers.
Another "disconcerting" factor i.s
j that the distance is measured from
the edge of the campus—that is, the
highway. So a mile and a half in
cludes all of Palo Alto's business dis
tricts, and part of Menlo.
University Undecided
| The only possibility that Roose
| velt beer may be tossed out of Palo
j Alto i.s for the University to invoke
I the revert clause in the original
| property deeds. Comptroller Roth
; was non-committal last night about
| what course of action would be
taken by the Trustees, if any.
The reversion clauses read that
"intoxicating liquors" cannot be sold.
Since 3.2 has been defined as non
i intoxicating, there is little chance
I that the clauses can be invoked.
| Rumwell also pointed out that there
j are three California cases recently
] holding that 3.2 is not intoxicating.
"Battle Over"
Adron Beene, Palo Alto attorney
' who last spring led the fight for
j beer, felt that the battle was over.
' Palo Alto has light wines and beer,
j The mile and a half state restriction
] prevents harder drinks. That's that.
Police Chief Zink stood ready to
j arrest any venders of hai"d liquor in
I Palo Alto. As to Menlo Park, no
| authorities could be reached last
I night, but the general feeling was
that "technical" enforcement of the
distance ruling would be left to
county authorities, if at all.
So far Stanfordites can get beer
in Paly and by going a little far
ther to Menlo—anything wanted.
Hotels and cafes are on the out
side looking in, according to the
latest ruling from State Attorney
General Wobb. No hard drinks, set
| ups, cocktails and such will be
i served with meals. California will
| go in for buying its intoxicants in
j drug store quantities. There will be
ino drink by drink buying across
| bars.
j The Stanford Union will continue
j to serve near beer (if any more is
! made). The University will continue
i to frown on the spirits of Bacchus
i and Barleycorn. Stanfordites will
j journey to Palo Alto as merchants
: hang out beer signs today. Still
: thirsty, they may go on to Menlo.
