# The 						Death March Begins

### 
The snoopy system of Bawl-Out averages is on its way
out. Like stock market quotations, plus and minus grades
have for years classified Stanford men and women. And as
the ticker in the registrar's ofiice clicked along its merry
way, Stanford chagrin and hauteur rase and fell, often
crashed.
Bawl-Out quotations have never been of great intellec
tual significance. They have never fitted into the academic
pattern of the L'niversity, hut rather like a cancerous ap
pendage have attached themselves to the real constructive
body of the educational system.
II lias been mildly amusing to follow the grade curves
of our friends and neighbors. The practice is one that has
contributed very little to raising the moral or mental tone
of the campus. When the Bawl-Out goes, the Goddess of
(iossip (if there be such a woman) will suffer a serious,
necessary set-back.
With the omission of grade averages in the little buff
pamphlet, il is suggested that long missing, long needed
telephone numbers be substituted. Such a change would
make the dear little book much more interesting, much
more valuable. The Palv-dwelling grad, and the studious
hermits who Jive a life of seclusion in the more remote
reaches of the Farm will at last gain communication with
the rest of the student body.
The Bawl-(hit must go!
