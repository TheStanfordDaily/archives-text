We always feel sad and a bit sheepish when thai in
which our youthful faith has been placed proves to he
nothing hul an imposter. Cap and Gown having fitted itself
into that category, we pause to bemoan not the passing of
one of our ideals hut rather our own foolishness for having
clung to it for so long.
It has always been suggested that elections to Cap and
Gown were not conducted on the highest ethical plane, that
ils purpose is almost purely social. We hated to believe it.
Campus leaders, we hoped, would not stoop to political
intrigues in recognizing, officially, other campus leaders.
We were disillusioned.
So were the three members who resigned. They had
worked for Cap and Gown election as the highest achieve
ment in activities offered to a Stanford woman, only to
find that in it or out of it, the reason for their status was
sure to be allied with some sort of shady politics.
Hoping to prevent a continuation of this, they proposed
â– what they felt to be the only solution a change in mem
bership requirements and the adoption of a new purpose.
Sentimental alumnae blocked their move. Weak actives
fluctuated between the Iwo factions, hoping for some sort
of conciliation, they knew not what. In view of the funda
mental differences of opinion, it was fell bv the three that
their purpose could not be achieved; therefore the resig
nations.
Cap and Gown lias an amendment on its records pro
viding for automatic membership on basis of campus posi
tions only. It may choose to ignore it, as it may also choose
to ignore the new purpose proposed. Those who are left
may profit by the sacrifice of these three members and
work to make Cap and Gown an organization respected
and revered on the campus, as well it should he. Or they
may continue the devious methods of election and the
meandering actions of the past.
