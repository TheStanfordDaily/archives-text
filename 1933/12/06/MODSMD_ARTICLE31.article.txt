## BAWL-OUT IS CRUEL MASTER OVER GRADE SLAVES 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
To the Daily editors on Tuesday
go congratulations, an orchid, and a
sound slap on the back. The defi
nite stand taken on grades and the
Bawl-out was laudable enough to
make up for all such pernicious at
tacks on football and the struggling
rally committee and at the same
time warmed the hearts of many of
the righteous who resent grade sys
tems.
The Class of '37 looked with glee
at the low marks of football players
in the fall Bawl-out but it sud
denly realized that its first attempts

, at conquering college grades would !
soon be blaring before the eyes of
the world. New importance was at
tached to the necessity for making i
• grades, so that as a result the ma
jority of the Class of '37 are sweat- j
ing in the cit library and tenaciously
attacking their frogs in the biology
lab with just one purpose in mind—
to get C's or B's or maybe an A.
Learning to them is secondary.
Grades are first. Almighty grades, j
The bane of modern education.
The Bawl-out may not go but it
should.
—John McClelland, '37
