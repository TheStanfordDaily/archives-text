# EVEN PSYCHOLOGY DAMNS THE BAWL-OUT!
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The very idea of an old Phi Bete
like you screaming about grade
points in the Bawl-out. You ought
to be proud to have all those num
bers after your name, but as for me,
it is a different matter.
I'm 155-13. Just try and imagine 1
my humiliation and chagrin. In this
case, the sins of the children are
visited on the parents. Just think
of the mental suffering of hundreds
of parents whose wayward offspring
are a blot on a good name.
And worst of all, Abe, it's no
body's damn business how dumb
these kids are. Let's keep the fam
ily skeleton in the closet as long as

possible.
And as to the Profs., let 'em look
up our records if they wish, but j
don't make it so darned easy for!
them. Let 'em call up the registrar's '
office to find out.
Grade points, or lack of them, ;
can't down me, but just think of all ;
our psychopathic Stanford students j
who develop serious cases of in- ;
feriority complex as a result of that j
old ogre, J. P. Mitchell and his pol
icy of defamation.
Hurrah for Dean Mary, and we.
may get the New Deal yet!
Trusting that I have insulted no {
one, I remain,
W. A. Roberts
