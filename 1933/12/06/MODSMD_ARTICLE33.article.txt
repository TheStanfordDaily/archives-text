# CAP AND GOWN—REFORM VS. TRADITION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
To some it may seem strange that
I, who am not a member of Cap
and Gown, should discuss that or
ganization, particularly, should crit
icize it. Perhaps I can explain my
position so that what follows will
not be discredited as the words of
a disappointed office—or rather, 1
honor-seeker.
I have, during the past three and
a half years, been interested in ob
serving the position held by Cap and
Gown on the campus, and in what
it has represented in the minds ol' !
both those in the organization and
those, who like myself, are on the
outside. I did not start my observa
tions with any preconceived prej
udices; far from it, I too, with all j
the new women of my year, looked
with admiration at those who wore
the Cap and Gown pin—insignia of
divine recognition. But what 1 have '
seen has shattered my earlier illu
sions.
Such a statement cannot be i
made without facts. The situation i
has been this. The organization
has been wholly lacking in any
purpose except (hat of honoring
already recognized so-called wo
men leaders. And what deter
mined a leader according to Cap
and Gown standards? Personal
dislikes, disagreeable personality
(raits, sorority affiliations.
Realizing this situation, seven
members of Cap and Gown felt that
reality must be faced, that a new
purpose—other than merely that of
satisfying every man's " pleasure at
receiving orchids—should be deter
mined upon, that a new election sys
tem be instituted.
This group comprised Alice Ih
graham, former women's editor of
the Daily, sponsor, and member of
A.W.S. Council; Benetta Merner,
former A.W.S. president; Mary
Katherine Morris, former A.W.S.
president; Barbara Binns, present
A.W.S. vice-president; Babe Dear,
present W.A.A. px-esident; and
Jeanne Millard, present A.W.S. pres
ident.
Their stand was clearly that they
opposed the present election system
and, further, that they opposed an
organization that was merely an
honorary association — such an in
tention never having had any part
in the original constitution.
When this controversy first i
opened. Miss Yost, before a group
of both active and alumni mem
bers, expressed her opinion. She
said that it should be realized that
the organization was not its orig
inal purpose and that a new pur
pose should be set up. Further,
that beyond the inadequacies in
the present system, the increasing
number of women should prohibit
(he satisfactory use of the elec
tion system, and she suggested
(hat membership be automatic
with certain designated offices.
This was the plan that had been
accepted by the active group and
was being carried forward when the
alumnae met and refused their co
operation, a necessary part of the
new plan. They said the active
members—the only ones possessing
a vote—had no right* to overthrow
the traditions of the past 25 years.
They had to admit that these mem

1 bers alone had the constitutional
right to make changes—but they an
swered to their own satisfaction that
they did not have the moral right.
Is it immoral to make changes as an
endeavor toward reform and better
ment? A strange doctrine.
Plans could not go on, nothing
but the old system was possible.
"The Revolutionists" had failed.
So today most of the active mem
bers of the original group of seven
resigned, leaving in Cap and Gown
only four undergraduate and three
graduate active members—and the
traditions of 25 years.
What does this resignation mean?
It is the request by those resigning
, that their .stand, their convictions be
considered by all those eligible to
this quarter's election of Cap and
Gown. It is a plea that their best
judgment and opinions be consid
ered, that example be taken by their
resignations, which show that re
forms can not be made from the
•inside. Finally it is a plea to all Ye
i Worthy Ones, that you by refrain
-1 ing from joining will assist in a
movement of passive resistance to
demand -that a reform be made.

president; Barbara Binns, present
A.W.S. vice-president; Babe Dear,
present W.A.A. px-esident; and
Jeanne Millard, present A.W.S. pres
ident.
Their stand was clearly that they
opposed the present election system
and, further, that they opposed an
organization that was merely an
honorary association — such an in
tention never having had any part
in the original constitution.
When this controversy first i
opened. Miss Yost, before a group
of both active and alumni mem
bers, expressed her opinion. She
said that it should be realized that
the organization was not its orig
inal purpose and that a new pur
pose should be set up. Further,
that beyond the inadequacies in
the present system, the increasing
number of women should prohibit
(he satisfactory use of the elec
tion system, and she suggested
(hat membership be automatic
with certain designated offices.
This was the plan that had been
accepted by the active group and
was being carried forward when the
alumnae met and refused their co
operation, a necessary part of the
new plan. They said the active
members—the only ones possessing
a vote—had no right* to overthrow
the traditions of the past 25 years.
They had to admit that these mem

1 bers alone had the constitutional
right to make changes—but they an
swered to their own satisfaction that
they did not have the moral right.
Is it immoral to make changes as an
endeavor toward reform and better
ment? A strange doctrine.
Plans could not go on, nothing
but the old system was possible.
"The Revolutionists" had failed.
So today most of the active mem
bers of the original group of seven
resigned, leaving in Cap and Gown
only four undergraduate and three
graduate active members—and the
traditions of 25 years.
What does this resignation mean?
It is the request by those resigning
, that their .stand, their convictions be
considered by all those eligible to
this quarter's election of Cap and
Gown. It is a plea that their best
judgment and opinions be consid
ered, that example be taken by their
resignations, which show that re
forms can not be made from the
•inside. Finally it is a plea to all Ye
i Worthy Ones, that you by refrain
-1 ing from joining will assist in a
movement of passive resistance to
demand -that a reform be made.

The Editor, Sir:
To some it may seem strange that
I, who am not a member of Cap
and Gown, should discuss that or
ganization, particularly, should crit
icize it. Perhaps I can explain my
position so that what follows will
not be discredited as the words of
a disappointed office—or rather, 1
honor-seeker.
I have, during the past three and
a half years, been interested in ob
serving the position held by Cap and
Gown on the campus, and in what
it has represented in the minds ol' !
both those in the organization and
those, who like myself, are on the
outside. I did not start my observa
tions with any preconceived prej
udices; far from it, I too, with all j
the new women of my year, looked
with admiration at those who wore
the Cap and Gown pin—insignia of
divine recognition. But what 1 have '
seen has shattered my earlier illu
sions.
Such a statement cannot be i
made without facts. The situation i
has been this. The organization
has been wholly lacking in any
purpose except (hat of honoring
already recognized so-called wo
men leaders. And what deter
mined a leader according to Cap
and Gown standards? Personal
dislikes, disagreeable personality
(raits, sorority affiliations.
Realizing this situation, seven
members of Cap and Gown felt that
reality must be faced, that a new
purpose—other than merely that of
satisfying every man's " pleasure at
receiving orchids—should be deter
mined upon, that a new election sys
tem be instituted.
This group comprised Alice Ih
graham, former women's editor of
the Daily, sponsor, and member of
A.W.S. Council; Benetta Merner,
former A.W.S. president; Mary
Katherine Morris, former A.W.S.
president; Barbara Binns, present
A.W.S. vice-president; Babe Dear,

this quarter's election of Cap and
Gown. It is a plea that their best
judgment and opinions be consid

movement of passive resistance to
demand -that a reform be made.
