At progressive Stanford, it is
amusing every now and then to find
evidences of "throw-backs"—in pro
fessors, students, or opinions. Dur
ing recent weeks and days, the cam
pus has been treated to tidbits of
all three.
The St. James Park massacre be
came a yawning pit into which
faculty members and, more recently,
a student have put their blundering
feet. The attitude of certain profes
sors and students on this ghastly af
fair proves one very striking thing:
Professors do not believe everything
they talk about, and students pay
little attention to what they hear
talked about. This is no new or
startling discovery since everyone is
familiar with the classroom coma
that so often grips both lecturer and
leeturee.

Further evidence that "our con
temporary ancestors" are not con
fined to the hill country comes with
the expressed attitude of a Campus
Opinioner concerning neglected "pa
triotism." Stanford has always felt
it could sneer at those whom His
tory's Bailey refers to as "tub
thumpers and rabble-raisers." Stan
ford has viewed with unmitigated
disgust the jingoism of the yellow
press and the "patriotic" burblings
of the political hog-callers.
But apparently, obviously, every
one has not been able to screw his
face into an enlightened sneer. There
are some who through mulishneis
or myopia have failed to grasp the
higher purposes of an institution oi
higher learning.
If a college becomes merely a j
place to acquire a little varnish with !
which to reburnish pet prejudices 1
and putrified dogmas, the justigca- '
tion for such an academic system
becomes vague and obtuse. It is
the professed purpose of most uni
versities to push ahead into those
fields where the high school and the
small mind fear to tread. They grow
sluggish in this purpose. Stanford,
Cal, Yale, and all the rest deserve

WHAT WOULD DR. JORDAN THINK?

i the same fate meted out to the lame
ducks of the congressional system.
Through the darkness of bigotry,
stupidity, and that ultra-ultra con
; servatism which is labeled reac- j
tionism, Stanford has before it the
i shining light kindled by the late Dr. i
David Starr Jordan. He proclaimed
! his views on the "higher patriot- |
! ism," on intellectual freedom in
i general, and was promptly black
listed by the Better American Fed
eration, along with Jane Addams,
Clarcnce Darrow, and other lumi-
J naries.
Stanford has seen the light. It j
must be kept burning.
