## THE 						LAST WORD ON ST. MARY'S 
### 
Within a few short weeks the es
timable Mr..Slip Madigan and his
football horde have .seen three big
games go a-glimmering over the
horizon, lugging with them some
two hundred thousand potential pay
ing customers. The strong undercur
rent of feeling that Mr. Madigan and
his Galloping Gaels resorted to
stunts that were considered not
quite cricket in the course of their
respective careers, suddenly broke
into the light.
Deservedly or not, St. Mary's has
developed an ill foot bull reputation.
It behooves Mr. Madigan and his as
sociates, to give an eye, or rather an
oar, to the insinuations that are
ma'de, whether discreetly or bluntly,
by their peers. It will require a
long, hard pull to erase that sooty
reputation, and the St. Mary's gen-
Iry may well mind their P's and Q's
with more lhan customary circum
spection henceforth.
