# GAME IMPORTANT FOR THE BRONCS
## 
### 
It hurts Santa Clara to turn down
a sure (>O,OOO gate, because their
schedule is replete with blank spaces
already, and they will be obliged to
hustle to adequately fill St. Mary's
place. If a few more of the colleges
displayed such courage the dirty
football bugaboo would soon be
eliminated.
Most of the piofessional sports
writers, notably Mr. Curley Grieve,
shed crocodile tears because that
magnificent spectacle, the "Little
Big Game," will be no more, and he
is much disturbed over differences
which separate two great schools,
and says that it can lead to no good
end. We hardly think that friend
ship between two schools leads to
any great end if it leaves two of the
boys in the condition that Al Tassi
and Joe Paglia are today.
