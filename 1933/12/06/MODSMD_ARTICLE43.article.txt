# STATISTICS PROVE COLUMBIA STRONG ROSE BOWL TEAM
## 
### Charles Chappell 
When the Columbia Lions and the
Stanford Indians tangle in their
much-publicized fracas on New
Year's Day, two teams with one de
feat each, will be upholding the
honor of their respective sections.
Though undefeated and untied
elevens are usually picked for the
Rose Bowl classic, the numerous up
sets in 1933 football make an un
beaten team one of those curious
anomalies that is conspicuous by its
absence.
Doubting Thomases who point
with horror to Columbia's early
season defeat by Princeton evidently
overlook the muddy defeat that
Stanford suffered at the hand of
Washington. Just as Stanford staged
a comeback that carried it through
a decidedly successful season, so Co
lumbia's rejuvenated Lions returned
with a vengeance and swept ihrough
all opposition in convincing fashion.
Columbia's Strength
An idea of Columbia's real
strength can be gained from the fol
lowing yardage and score record for
the season:
Columbia 39, 13 first downs, 321
yards; Lehigh 0, two first downs,
three yards.
Columbia 15, eight first downs,
279 yards; Virginia 9, nine first
down's, 50 yards.
Columbia 0, nine first downs, 97
yards; Princeton 20, ten first downs,
179 yards.
Columbia 33, 22 first downs, 381
yards; Penn State 0, four first downs,
50 yards.
Columbia 9, 13 first downs; 91
yards; Cornell G, four first downs,
42' yards.
Columbia 14, 15 first downs, 317
yard.s; Navy 7, three first downs, 91
yards.
Columbia 46, 12 first downs, 301
yards; Lafayette 0, six first downs,
102 yards.
Columbia 16, 14 first downs, 228
yards; Syracuse 0, two first downs,
11 yards.
Deceptive Attack
A speedy deceptive attack that has
enabled the Lions to run up 172
points to 45 for their opposition will
be pitted against Stanford's none
too slow offense when the two teams
meet. Captain Cliff Montgomery at
quarterback is the spark-plug of the
Columbia offense.
Coach Lou Little will probably
bring his charges West on the 19th
when Columbia's Christmas holidays
begin. Qualms of conscience over
missed classes will not trouble the
Lions because their vacation ex
tends until January 3. Stanford will
probably entrain for the scene of
action at Pasadena soon after the
quarter's finals are over.
