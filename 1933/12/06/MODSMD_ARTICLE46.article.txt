# CARDINAL POLO TEAM MEETS U.C. FRIDAY IN SECOND ANNUAL CLASH
## 
### 
Stanford's Arizona-jaunting polo
ists will be seen in action again on
' the Farm this Friday when they
| meet California's recently - formed
quartet. Although the Bear's team,
just organized last year, is probably
not strong enough yet to give the
Indians much of a battle, the Cali
fornia-Stanford clash gives promise
of developing into the Big Game of
Bay region polo.
Captain Gordan expects to start
the line-up that trounced Arizona
in Tucson last Friday. This will

I find Captain Luppe Luppcn at
number one, Woody Melone at
two, Frank Burns at three, and
Bill Rogers at back.
The Indian reserves will be given
a chance to show what they can do.
1 The second-string line-up consists
of Carl Emeis, Kemp Maer, Bill
Enemark, and Jim Henderson. Since
a great many capable players turned
out for the team this year, the re
serves are rated as capable of put
ting up an excellent battle against
the Bears.
