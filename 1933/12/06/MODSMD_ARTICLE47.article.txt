### 
Latest reports from the Associated
Press reveal Columbia's attitude on
the Rose Bowl game has gone sour
grapes. An editorial appearing in
the Columbia Spectator, student
I daily, sadly deplored the action of
I the Board of Athletic Control in
accepting the bid on the grounds of
Columbia going "circussy."
"Columbia University had its
chance yesterday to show conclu
sively thfit inter-collegiate football
is not a public spectacle for profit,''
the Spectator said. "It had its chance
to stand out above any institution
!in the United States as pre-emi
nently a university devoted to the
advancement of learning and re
search. By permitting the football
team to strike out for Pasadena it
i has repudiated its own standards."
