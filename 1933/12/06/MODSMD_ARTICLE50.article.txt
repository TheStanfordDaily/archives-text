Strong A.T.O. Drive
In the iiist half of the game A.T.O.
displayed strong offensive drive
which threatened to run rampant
over Sigma Nu. Shortly after the
kick-off, Sigma Nu failing to make
yardage, Ted Leidig kicked to Ernie
Arbuckle on hi.s 36-yard line.
Immediately Ray Forsythe began
shooting passes, first to Arbuckle,
then to Stewart. In .six plays they
were near the Sigma Nu goal, but
failed to score when Leidig and
Bansbaeh knocked down a pass io
Frank Springer over the goal line.
A fumble cost Sigma Nu 10 yards.
A kick was blocked when a Sigma
Nu man backed into hi.s own punter,
and recovered by A.T.O.
Bansbaeh momentarily saved the
day by intercepting Forsythe's pass
to Goss on the 3-yard line, but when
Leidig attempted to kick out, Hank
Dahleen broke through and par
tially blocked it. On the fourth at
tempt of A.T.O. to push over a
score, Forsythe passed 30 yards to
Arbuckle who made a beautiful
catch over the opposing half-back's
head for a touchdown. Conversion
failed when a pass was knocked
away from Dahleen.
Sigma Nu Attack
Interception of a short A.T.O.
shovel pass, Forsythe to Arbuckle,
then took place on the A.T.O. 35-
yard line, as the second half got un
der way and Sigma Nu began to
click. A pass from Bud Shreve to
Leidig put the ball on the A.T.O.
20-yard marker. The first of two
15-yard penalties was then inflicted,
Ihe second coming after Shreve,
Mullen, and Leidig had worked the
ball back to the 8-yard line. For
sythe then intercepted and kicked
out on his own IG.
Second Score
A.T.O* took the ball after a pass
over the goal, and Leidig intercep
ted on their 35-yard line, running
to the 18. Howard Buller made an
impossible catch of Shreve's pass a
yard from the goal, and two plays
later Mullen scored on a flat pass
from Shreve. A fake kick, developed
into a J.HSS from Buller to Lyndon,

v/as knocked down by Frank Ste
wart.
