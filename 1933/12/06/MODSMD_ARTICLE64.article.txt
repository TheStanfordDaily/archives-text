LA FORZA DEL DESTINO (Verdi)
War Memorial Opera House
Verdi ever had difficulty in finding
amenable stories through which to
trace his persuasive melodic line,
and "Forza Del Destino" was far
from the best of them. Its tragic
horrors are disconnected and ludi
crous; one whole scene and parts of
others were cut in the San Francisco
revival, and it made no difference.
As befits Latin operatics the music
was the real story, and it is spirited,
ingenuous Latin music, more civi
lized than "II Trovatore," foreshad
owing the more complex richness of
"Aida." Verdi used his story only
to divide it into proportionate solo
scenes for everybody; and he was
successful without being blatant.
Tlie singing admirably main
tained the level of Verdi's enthu
siasm, where the staging and
histrionics did not. Pinza and
Bonclii were the stars of the eve
ning, with Mu/.io and Martinelli
running close behind them.
Both lyrically and pictorially the
second act was the high spot. There
in Pinza won due recognition for his
superb singing, consistently true and
sonorous. He is one bass who can
sing a tune instead of merely thump
ing a tremolo.

Bonelli's Don Carlo was blithe but
jof discreet authority; he gave the
j third act a fine emotional climax.!
| Martinelli, straining less than usual, |
i cut such an absurdly childish figure i
in his pirouettes and finger-bitings
that he almost destroyed the im
pression of his frequent good, though
breathless, vocal quality; his tenor,
however, showed its age and its in- !
nate inflexibility.
i Muzio, a lovely Leonora, sang
j beautiful piano passages, but often ;
leaped into high voice without di- j
rection and missed pitch. Incidental
arias were done with good humor
by Myrtle Leonard and Gandolfi.
"Forza Del Destino" closed one of
the finest opera seasons San Fran
cisco has had with intense spirit, ,
emotional display, and fitting cli—
