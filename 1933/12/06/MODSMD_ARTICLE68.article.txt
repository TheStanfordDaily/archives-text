# IRVING BABBITT
## Some Recollections I 
### Frederick Anderson 
Viewed from a distance of twenty years, the position which
Irving Babbitt occupied in the academic world is singularly
clear. The students who attended his courses were largely
graduate students who had come to Harvard from every part
of America. We had expected great things and were much
disappointed by the teutonic 'literary science' which was
droned out to us (mayna cum bibliofjruphia) under the guise
of humane letters. Most of our professors were sustained in
their dismal pursuits by mere love of learning, a passion
which seemed to us unaccountable and probably depraved. In
such an atmosphere Babbitt was the bearer of a new gospel:
we lloeked to hear him as the Welsh miners, weary of soul
less orthodoxy, lloeked to hear Wesley. For Babbitt promised
to make the study of the humanities a living force in our lives
and perhaps in the life of humanity at large. Even the free
play of the mind about speculative subjects, as one finds it in
the later works of Kenan, he denounced as "high-class intel
lectual vaudeville." Not only must criticism deal with 'ideas,'
but those ideas must be set to work. As I understood it then,
his message amounted to about this: in both art and morals
(which Babbitt constantly confused) there is a kind of central
eminence which the greatest men have more or less uncon
sciously succeeded in reaching, and it is by diligent study of
these 'centripetal' writers that we moderns must seek moral
and aesthetic salvation. As is the ease with most Protestant
creeds, our salvation is never sure: we must be sober and keep
vigil, perpetually exercising the 'inner check' over our unrc
generate impulses or we will slip from the summit of grace
and slide with frightful speed into total depravity.
The metaphor is not unfairly chosen, for Babbitt spoke
and wrote with an air of religious conviction. He would come
into the class-room bearing a fat bundle of notes —a kind of
humanistic Bible- and licking his middle linger copiously to
aid him in the rapid search for texts, he would begin his task
(if lambasting the Scarlet Woman of Bousseauism, damning
heretical authors with words taken from their very mouths,
warning us against the deadly sin of excentricity. Indeed, it
was precisely Ibis earnestness, this fierce conviction that criti
cal controversy really mattered, this awful sense that the fate
of future generations depended upon ridding our culture of
all Rousseauistic taint, that attracted us. We were ripe for
conversion and most of us actually 'got humanism.' It was
generally believed that Babbitt himself did not stand well with
the authorities and that we ourselves would probably miss the
highest rewards if we insisted on following the humanistic
line; yet several men told me privately that they were ready
to accept this mild martyrdom.

I must confess that 1 find 'Babbitt revisited' a little dis
appointing. His style is admirably clear and trenchant, but I
suspect those qualities arc partly due to want of philosophic
discipline. He takes it for granted that truth is revealed in
tradition without suspecting the presence of unreconcilablc
contradictions or the possibility that in certain respects our
whole Western culture may suffer from bias. He treats tra
dition with the exaggerated respect which Burke showed for
vested interests. He says, for example, in one of the lectures
delivered at Stanford (later published under the title of De
mocracy and Leadership): "It is possible to show that the
pacifist is not only a materialist, but a very objectionable type
of materialist. In the name of the fairest virtues, he is actu
ally engaged in breaking down ethical standards. It is a mat
ter of common sense and everyday experience that there can
be no peace with the unrighteous and the unrighteous always
have been and are extremely numerous." Surely this is carry
ing logic too far. Old as it is and hallowed by the most sacred
biblical and literary traditions, this custom of identifying
'one's enemies with 'the unrighteous' and feeling il your sacred
duty to pitch into them is a bad custom —a ease of pervasive
bias.
In looking into Rousseau and Romanticism recently I was
further struck by a thing which I never noticed before: the
plain fact that Babbitt did not really like literature. He is dis
gusted by Browning's enthusiasm for kissing; Wordsworth's
poetical tribute to the ennobling influence of nature seems to
him a deliberate Holding of common sense; nowhere, so far
as I can remember, does he show any genuine appreciation of
art per sc. He would presumably agree with Plato that the
works of the poets ought to be carefully revised by a middle
aged archangel.

The rapid transformation of ideals after the World War
has probably brought doubt into the minds of many ancient
'humanists' beside myself. Yet we must always be grateful
for the inlluence of a singularly lucid and distinguished mind
during the impressionable years when we were seeking a
Weltanschauung/. The clash with Babbitt's dogmatism shat
tered our own, and I dare say that if a group of Babbitt's for
mer students could be got together they would bear witness
to the eflieacy (directly or indirectly) of his teaching. Most
of them have continued to protest against the tendency to
regard the study of literature as a blameless refinement, like
French and dancing in a young ladies' boarding school, or as
;i subject for merely 'scientific' study; and most of them have
continued to see in the study of literary tradition a powerful
auxiliary in the search for truth. That bis disciples should
depart so widely from his teaching in other matters was prob
ably a disappointment to him while he was alive; but from
the Elvsian Fields these matters look quite differently. He
must know now that he was a very successful teacher.
