# U.S. Refinancing
## 
### 
In the middle of December the
government must pay out $727,000,-
000. It will be easy because plans
are all completed for borrowing the
money at 2 per cent. Critics of the
gold policy say the new notes won't
sell. Treasury men say it will be a
cinch in spite of the depreciated
dollar, which again declined mod
erately in world markets yesterday.
