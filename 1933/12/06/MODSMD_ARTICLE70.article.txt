# The 						Spinner
## (Inspired by the French of Paul Valéry)

The (jarden rocks in a melodious swell.
Beside the open sash a woman spins
And (/rows bewildered by her snoring wheel.
Her small head falling forward, she begins
To dream, weary of guiding the wheedling hair
That runs, evasive, through her hand which spins.
By falling flowers formed in the pure air,
. I living source, suspended to the day.
Waters her garden lAiile she idles there. 1
A stem the restless wind lingers to sway
Inclines a vain salute of starry grace—
Us rose before the ancient wheel to lay.
'The sleeper spins a single thread. The lace
Of fragile shadow strangely interweaves.
Spun with thread her sleeping fingers trace.
The gentle spindle endlessly receives
'J he lazy-winding dream with a caress
That stirs the credulous skein which it relieves.
Beyond so many flowers the blue is less
Than blue, spinner bound by leaves and light:
The last tree burns. The green sky perishes.
The rose, your sister, where a saint delights,
Perfumes your brow with breath unknown of sin;
)'ou languish . . . you are an extinguished light
. It the blue windozv, where you sit and spin.
The (jarden rocks in a melodious swell.
