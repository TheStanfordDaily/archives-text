I. THIS IS NOW
Airplane Crash
There were blue mountain lilacs blooming in the sage
brush all over the hills that day. It was springtime and rain
ing.
Newspaper reporters and photographers and policemen
and a crowd of Mexican ranch hands straggled up the muddy
roads in their automobiles and on horseback to the place
where the airplane had fallen 011 the hill-side right in a big
clump of lilacs.
When the Mexicans chopped down the bushes that were in
their way, broken flowers scattered over the silver wings.
After they had taken the papers from the pockets of the
three dead men, they put the bodies in rubber sacks and car
ried them to tlu 1 coroner's car.
"Christ, but that one was heavy," said the coroner's assist
ant. "I near to break my back carrying that one."
One of the policemen who had helped wiped the blood
from his hands. The Mexicans got some horses and dragged
the wreckage away. Gradually the crowd drifted down the hill
again until everyone was gone and there was nothing left at
all but a picec of silver cloth or two and the bent stems of
the broken lilac bushes raising themselves again in the rain.
No one ever did find out how it had happened.
Murder
Beside her on the bed lay the nude body of her dead lover.
She was like painted wax with her purple-stained fingernails
and her purplc-llushcd checks. There was a blue gun and
only a little blood.
It was like all cheap murders.
She had fired a bullet through the back of his head, and
then she had missed herself, but the third time she had put
the muzzle into her mouth and pulled the trigger.
Reporters milled around the small room until they had
torn all the photographs of her from their frames and had
telephoned her suicide note to their offices.
The coroner exploded his flashlight powder for some pic
tures before carrying the bodies away.
He locked the door, and all was empty and silent, with
some discarded photographs scattered over the lloor and the
white bed standing there marked with two dark splotches at
its head.
Later, paragraphs on the back pages of newspapers said
that Louise Hudson, 22, a waitress of 9307 Eighty-first Street,
had first shot Frederick Allen, 2(>, a mechanic of 4427 North
Irving Avenue, through the head and then had lired a bullet
into her own head because of love.
Attempted Suicide
All that you could hear in the bright white and nickel room
was the sound of !hc Japanese woman trying to breathe after
she had cut her throat.
They had strapped her hands and feet to the operating
table, but she whipped her head from side to side and made a
hoarse hissing.
Her face was a mask, smooth and brown with black hair
and a gaping, grinning mouth.
No one paid much attention to her, or hurried, because
such people were so common there at the receiving hospital.
The doctor said she might live.
She had tried to kill herself with a paring knife in her
small vegetable market because she owed a bill of nearly
ninety dollars which she could not pay.
11. WITCH
It was a strange land, and a strange sea. Black sand lay
on the shore like a sheet, tattered on one side by irregular
rocks piling upward into tall mountains of gleaming jet, and
cut oil" evenly on the other by the straight, sharp rim of the
amethyst ocean. Not a creature stirred on the sombre expanse
of a land whose unending darkness varied only in different
shades of black. Lone trees lifted motionless gVay arms; not
the slightest breath of a wind blew, and no sound was any
where.
The steaming ocean lay still against the sand. It was like
a stagnant purple pond expanded to fill half the universe.
From beach to horizon there was not a ripple nor a wave.
Where it met the shore, slow clouds of violet fog rose to hang
unmoving in the damp air. The red sun glowered over the
water like a round cannonhall of heated iron suddenly ar
rested in (light. Green light flickered across the sky from a
belt of lire circling the world below the horizon.
Swimming always from the north came that pallid girl.
The rhythmic stroke of her unearthly arms was almost all
that was left of time in that nearly timeless world. Invisibly,
without a bubble or an undulation, the amethyst water parted
in front of her and closed again behind. Her long silver hair
streamed through the sea like a serpent. She looked nowhere,
but when her head turned with the stroke, she showed her
little pointed ears, and her eyes glittered like green glass in
the rays of the crimson sun.
Above her Happed seven long-billed birds of gold. They
moved their wings in unison, one —two —Ihrce —four. One of
them voiced a forlorn and desolate wail. They sailed on.
Their thin black legs were drawn up close to their bodies.
They had red eyes. They turned never.
Always toward the south, past the strange coast, through
the hot sea, the witch swam on, until only the seven birds
could be seen, floating like seven minute Hakes of gold in the
quiescent air.
111. SEA DEATH
The sea that afternoon was like a plain of crushed green
glass. From the height of a hill, its semi-circle of crinkled
surface looked hard as the roughened face of an immense
jewel set in white foam, and cut oil' on one side by the sharp
edge of the sky. Upon it struck the strong beams of the sun
light, to be shattered into half a universe-full of fragments
that lay on the liquid lloor of the world like a veil of quivering
lire.
Near the base of the hill, where the black rocks were
harder than the sea, a girl was drowning. It was very simple.
She was only half a hundred feet from shore, with the sunlight
all around her, and her face still in the warm air. A little
strength, a length of rope, a bit of wood, or another one of
her own kind, and she would have been safe. But she was
very tired, and there was no one near, only the sea gulls living

by, staring at her with incurious bright eyes, and Ihc crabs
among the rocks, and the silence of all but the sea.
She had been swimming for a long time. There was not
any power It'll in her arms and legs. They had a weight, now,
so that her whole body rested low in the water, with her head
just above the level that divided life from the unknown, and
the little ripples splashing into her eyes and mouth. She was
too exhausted to light much, but every few seconds she made
a feeble splashing, and every few seconds she swallowed an
infinitesimal part of the lovely glittering sea. She was like a
bug caught in a pan of water, but the pan was larger, with
one side the unyielding el ill' that spoke to her only when she
screamed, and the other the steep bank of the sky.
Once she looked back, and there was nothing but a limit
less waste of water, dancing out to meet the horizon. There
was only the ocean, with a mighty pull she could not resist.
For almost a minute after that, she stared at the nearest
rock and with all herself begged someone to give her life back
whole again. She thought of light—one afternoon when she
had sat listening to music, with the heavy sunlight dripping
like warm honey to form a pool all around her. There had
been a night when she had seen a street lamp beating like a
yellow heart that spilled its blood on the soiled sidewalk.
There was always light.
These three or four minutes, the waves had been rolling in
just as they had all the years that the girl had been a child
learning to speak, and growing up, and going to school, and
falling in love, only now they were smaller than usual, because
it was such a c|nict afternoon. One rolled up from the sea
close to shore and formed while fingers that pulled it toward
the rocks. They folded the blanket of the ocean over the
girl's head and went on to clutch at the land, and then they
crumpled.
Nothing had happened, really. The waves went on, and
the gulls Hew by. The hill was there, and the sea still glittered,
and the sun was only a little lower in the sky. The world had
not changed. The bit of matter that had been on the land
was now in a denser and more fluid sphere, but il was all
there. Not a bit of the vital and precious elements had been
lost. The electrons and protons would come forth slowly to
renew the green waves and the sand and the kelp. They could
not be destroyed. All that was gone was a movement and a
thought and a feeling; a line of beauty past belief, and a voice
of incredible loveliness that never would sound again.
