# The 						Critics Draw a Moral
## 
### James Sandoe 
It is the habit of some modern critics to damn a play as
"inconsequential" simply because it does not contain a "mes
sage" or a problem. Thus there may be observed the amusing
sight of-critics vainly seeking to justify an evening of sheer,
unadulterated amusement in the theatre by attempting to
extract a moral from every play which they encounter.
I am convinced that this foolish practice is the basic ex
planation for such a violent attack as that recently aimed at
Noel Coward's witty "Design for Living" by Vanity Fair's
theatre commentator, Mr. George Jean Nathan.
Nathan has done the American theatre a great service in
exposing shallow frauds unmercifully and disposing of them
in a few biting lines. But here he allowed his love of debunk
ing to carry him too far. Some critic had unjustiliedly sought
to credit Coward with a profound philosophic basis for his
play. And Nathan's attack was misdirected —at the play
(which is an absurd and amusing melee, perhaps not the besL
of Coward's work but free, at least, from the pretensions
which marked such an early work as " I he Vortex ) rather
than at the moral gentleman-philosopher.
How much better is this frankly shallow but intensely
amusing play than that all too frequently encountered drama
which, masking as comedy, presents some absurd problem
an< l —completely forgetting its original claim—works it out
solemnly to the finish.
I refer particularly to the writings of the American play
wright Philip Barry, whose pseudo-problem comedies seem to
satisfy not only the cravings of the maxim-hunters but, as
well, the usually keen-eyed Nathan.
Insofar as his plays are comedies they follow a fixed pat
tern. Consider what is perhaps his most widely known work,
a play which may be said to represent fairly his comic writing
as a whole —"Holiday."
The play presents, with undue seriousness, the plan of
Johnny Case to save some of his youth for pleasure by retiring
from business as frequently as he has a comfortable sum,
and returning only when that is gone. The idea itself is, it
must be confessed, comic; but comic innocently rather than
intentionally.
It is scarcely necessary to point out not only the imprac
ticability of the scheme (and it should be noted that Barry
himself feels serious about the matter) but, as well and more
importantly, its lack of justification either as a problem or as
comedy.
What comedy the play contains is found not in the work
ings of the plot itself, but —largely—in two interludes: a con
versation in the first act between Linda Seton and Johnny,
and a vaudeville monologue plus some eccentric jumping by
Barry's "sympathetic" characters in the second.
Compare with this the consistent and pure comedy of
"Private Lives" or of "Design for Living" or of "Hay Fever."
In the lirsl there may he found two brief, romantic scenes
(but even these are free from moral —in the broader sense—
and maintain their comic tones by an incisive use of sudden
bathetic descent); in the others there is no suggestion even
of tills.
Here there is no playing for comedy upon the pathetic
(for this use of whimsy is Harry's only other comic device),
but rapid, consistently high comedy of the purest sort.
Further, Barry, in an effort to prove his characters excep
tionally charming, resorts to methods which leave an unfor
tunate air of vulgarity about them: the witty Linda Seton,
supported in her actions only by her own word, insults two
relatives out of her little playhouse kingdom.
Coward builds no such pretentious defense for his char
acters; when Klyot Chase unceremoniously cuts oil' a tele
phone conversation it is not vindictively, with an eye to his
own eminent worth, but gleefully, because he has got himselt
out of an absurd scrape by an absurd means.
All of this is not to say that Coward's plays are works of
art inestimable in their value. To the contrary they are, by
their very nature, extremely perishable. Topical, colloquial,
they will have lost their gleam in annotations and footnotes
before many years have passed. "Hay Fever" alone possesses
that universality in its satire and the object ot that satire
which seems likely to persist.
But their very lack of pretension as against the palpably
devised problems of the Barry plays, together with their easy
and unfailing comic tone, make them fresher and more truly
amusing than the at most—sporadically wise-cracking plays
of Barry.
That is why both the habit of damning a play as of no
value because it is without a pointed moral, and the habit of
grubbing unjustifiably and defensively about to to find one
seem eminently foolish. It should be sufficient that a play,
calling itself a comedy, offers an evening of amusement. There
is no reason to praise or damn it on any other grounds once
that limitation is recognized.

amusing than the at most—sporadically wise-cracking plays
of Barry.
That is why both the habit of damning a play as of no
value because it is without a pointed moral, and the habit of
grubbing unjustifiably and defensively about to to find one
seem eminently foolish. It should be sufficient that a play,
calling itself a comedy, offers an evening of amusement. There
is no reason to praise or damn it on any other grounds once
that limitation is recognized.
It is the habit of some modern critics to damn a play as
"inconsequential" simply because it does not contain a "mes
sage" or a problem. Thus there may be observed the amusing
sight of-critics vainly seeking to justify an evening of sheer,
unadulterated amusement in the theatre by attempting to
extract a moral from every play which they encounter.
I am convinced that this foolish practice is the basic ex
planation for such a violent attack as that recently aimed at
Noel Coward's witty "Design for Living" by Vanity Fair's
theatre commentator, Mr. George Jean Nathan.
Nathan has done the American theatre a great service in
exposing shallow frauds unmercifully and disposing of them
in a few biting lines. But here he allowed his love of debunk
ing to carry him too far. Some critic had unjustiliedly sought
to credit Coward with a profound philosophic basis for his
play. And Nathan's attack was misdirected —at the play
(which is an absurd and amusing melee, perhaps not the besL
of Coward's work but free, at least, from the pretensions
which marked such an early work as " I he Vortex ) rather
than at the moral gentleman-philosopher.
How much better is this frankly shallow but intensely
amusing play than that all too frequently encountered drama
which, masking as comedy, presents some absurd problem
an< l —completely forgetting its original claim—works it out
solemnly to the finish.
I refer particularly to the writings of the American play
wright Philip Barry, whose pseudo-problem comedies seem to
satisfy not only the cravings of the maxim-hunters but, as
well, the usually keen-eyed Nathan.
Insofar as his plays are comedies they follow a fixed pat
tern. Consider what is perhaps his most widely known work,
a play which may be said to represent fairly his comic writing
as a whole —"Holiday."
The play presents, with undue seriousness, the plan of
Johnny Case to save some of his youth for pleasure by retiring
from business as frequently as he has a comfortable sum,
and returning only when that is gone. The idea itself is, it
must be confessed, comic; but comic innocently rather than
intentionally.
It is scarcely necessary to point out not only the imprac
ticability of the scheme (and it should be noted that Barry
himself feels serious about the matter) but, as well and more
importantly, its lack of justification either as a problem or as
comedy.
What comedy the play contains is found not in the work
ings of the plot itself, but —largely—in two interludes: a con
versation in the first act between Linda Seton and Johnny,
and a vaudeville monologue plus some eccentric jumping by
Barry's "sympathetic" characters in the second.
Compare with this the consistent and pure comedy of
"Private Lives" or of "Design for Living" or of "Hay Fever."
In the lirsl there may he found two brief, romantic scenes
(but even these are free from moral —in the broader sense—
and maintain their comic tones by an incisive use of sudden
bathetic descent); in the others there is no suggestion even
of tills.
Here there is no playing for comedy upon the pathetic
(for this use of whimsy is Harry's only other comic device),
but rapid, consistently high comedy of the purest sort.
Further, Barry, in an effort to prove his characters excep
tionally charming, resorts to methods which leave an unfor
tunate air of vulgarity about them: the witty Linda Seton,
supported in her actions only by her own word, insults two
relatives out of her little playhouse kingdom.
Coward builds no such pretentious defense for his char
acters; when Klyot Chase unceremoniously cuts oil' a tele
phone conversation it is not vindictively, with an eye to his
own eminent worth, but gleefully, because he has got himselt
out of an absurd scrape by an absurd means.
All of this is not to say that Coward's plays are works of
art inestimable in their value. To the contrary they are, by
their very nature, extremely perishable. Topical, colloquial,
they will have lost their gleam in annotations and footnotes
before many years have passed. "Hay Fever" alone possesses
that universality in its satire and the object ot that satire
which seems likely to persist.
But their very lack of pretension as against the palpably
devised problems of the Barry plays, together with their easy
and unfailing comic tone, make them fresher and more truly
amusing than the at most—sporadically wise-cracking plays

art inestimable in their value. To the contrary they are, by
their very nature, extremely perishable. Topical, colloquial,
they will have lost their gleam in annotations and footnotes
before many years have passed. "Hay Fever" alone possesses
that universality in its satire and the object ot that satire
which seems likely to persist.
But their very lack of pretension as against the palpably
devised problems of the Barry plays, together with their easy
and unfailing comic tone, make them fresher and more truly
amusing than the at most—sporadically wise-cracking plays
of Barry.
That is why both the habit of damning a play as of no
value because it is without a pointed moral, and the habit of
grubbing unjustifiably and defensively about to to find one
seem eminently foolish. It should be sufficient that a play,
calling itself a comedy, offers an evening of amusement. There
is no reason to praise or damn it on any other grounds once
that limitation is recognized.
It is the habit of some modern critics to damn a play as
"inconsequential" simply because it does not contain a "mes
sage" or a problem. Thus there may be observed the amusing
sight of-critics vainly seeking to justify an evening of sheer,
unadulterated amusement in the theatre by attempting to
extract a moral from every play which they encounter.
I am convinced that this foolish practice is the basic ex
planation for such a violent attack as that recently aimed at
Noel Coward's witty "Design for Living" by Vanity Fair's
theatre commentator, Mr. George Jean Nathan.
Nathan has done the American theatre a great service in
exposing shallow frauds unmercifully and disposing of them
in a few biting lines. But here he allowed his love of debunk
ing to carry him too far. Some critic had unjustiliedly sought
to credit Coward with a profound philosophic basis for his
play. And Nathan's attack was misdirected —at the play
(which is an absurd and amusing melee, perhaps not the besL
of Coward's work but free, at least, from the pretensions
which marked such an early work as " I he Vortex ) rather
than at the moral gentleman-philosopher.
How much better is this frankly shallow but intensely
amusing play than that all too frequently encountered drama
which, masking as comedy, presents some absurd problem
an< l —completely forgetting its original claim—works it out
solemnly to the finish.
I refer particularly to the writings of the American play
wright Philip Barry, whose pseudo-problem comedies seem to
satisfy not only the cravings of the maxim-hunters but, as
well, the usually keen-eyed Nathan.
Insofar as his plays are comedies they follow a fixed pat
tern. Consider what is perhaps his most widely known work,
a play which may be said to represent fairly his comic writing
as a whole —"Holiday."
The play presents, with undue seriousness, the plan of
Johnny Case to save some of his youth for pleasure by retiring
from business as frequently as he has a comfortable sum,
and returning only when that is gone. The idea itself is, it
must be confessed, comic; but comic innocently rather than
intentionally.
It is scarcely necessary to point out not only the imprac
ticability of the scheme (and it should be noted that Barry
himself feels serious about the matter) but, as well and more
importantly, its lack of justification either as a problem or as
comedy.
What comedy the play contains is found not in the work
ings of the plot itself, but —largely—in two interludes: a con
versation in the first act between Linda Seton and Johnny,
and a vaudeville monologue plus some eccentric jumping by
Barry's "sympathetic" characters in the second.
Compare with this the consistent and pure comedy of
"Private Lives" or of "Design for Living" or of "Hay Fever."
In the lirsl there may he found two brief, romantic scenes
(but even these are free from moral —in the broader sense—
and maintain their comic tones by an incisive use of sudden
bathetic descent); in the others there is no suggestion even
of tills.
Here there is no playing for comedy upon the pathetic
(for this use of whimsy is Harry's only other comic device),
but rapid, consistently high comedy of the purest sort.
Further, Barry, in an effort to prove his characters excep
tionally charming, resorts to methods which leave an unfor
tunate air of vulgarity about them: the witty Linda Seton,
supported in her actions only by her own word, insults two
relatives out of her little playhouse kingdom.
Coward builds no such pretentious defense for his char
acters; when Klyot Chase unceremoniously cuts oil' a tele
phone conversation it is not vindictively, with an eye to his
own eminent worth, but gleefully, because he has got himselt
out of an absurd scrape by an absurd means.
All of this is not to say that Coward's plays are works of
art inestimable in their value. To the contrary they are, by
their very nature, extremely perishable. Topical, colloquial,
they will have lost their gleam in annotations and footnotes
before many years have passed. "Hay Fever" alone possesses
that universality in its satire and the object ot that satire
which seems likely to persist.
But their very lack of pretension as against the palpably
devised problems of the Barry plays, together with their easy
and unfailing comic tone, make them fresher and more truly
