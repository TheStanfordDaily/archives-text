It lias been maintained by the editors of periodicals which
enjoy astonishing circulation records that each new "little
magazine" is as .superfluous to the American scene as an advo
cate of the Republican platform in South Carolina. A super
ficial examination of the field of the small reviews devoted to
comment on literature tends to convince the unbiased critic
that this cynical judgment is in many respects justified.
The most frequent argument presented is that the "little
magazine" are cliquish. In certain instances, it is true, the
pages of publications owned or controlled by cliques are filled
with self-praise and desultory imitation rather than creative
writing and criticism of positive worth. But there is another
side to the question. Would not literature be the poorer with
out such cliques as the Pre-Raphaelites, Ronsard's Pleiad, the
Encyclopedists, the Parnassians, and, to employ a more mod
ern example—those fervent artists who termed their move
ment the Irish Renaissance? Even the friends of Augustus
and Pericles could be said to have formed literary cliques. In
early American literature, there is the Transcendental group
which centered about Emerson.
The English coll'ee houses, the sixteenth and seventeenth
century royal courts, and the salons of the eighteenth cen
tury, were certainly forms of literary cliques. But their es
sential spirit was argument rather than conformity. If there
was a central figure, it did not follow that the members of the
group would bow down to him, or religiously echo his critical
views.
This is the type of literary clique which should be en
couraged—a type conspicuous by its absence from American
letters. There is the commercial literary magazine, of course,
but although it is willing to present both sides of controversial
problems, it demands that the arguments adhere in style and
content to the reading tastes of a homogeneous and frequently
only slightly literate public.
Stam'ohd Crfifria, in presenting its first issue, is anxious
to point out that material accepted is not published with the
intention of satisfying the tastes of a definite public or the
interests of a literary clique in the narrower sense of that
term.
Wishing to make itself a meeting place for ideas, and an
outlet for significant creative writing, Stanford Criteria
hopes eventually to assume the function of an eighteenth
century codec house or salon, where actively congenial minds
may meet in friendly disagreement. In taking this stand,
Stanford Criteria wishes to remind possible contributors
that ils columns are open to all. While the bulk of material
accepted will be from the pens (and the typewriters, we
hope!) of Stanford students, faculty members, and alumni
criticism, fiction, and poetry coining from any source will be
considered. While ils primary concern is to encourage cam
pus writing, Stanford Criteria refuses to ignore the fact that
the slate of American letters is a matter of concern for Cali
fornia as well as for New York, and that for Stanford to iso
late itself from the rest of the literary world is a grievous,
self-destructive mistake. There is no place in our intellectual
life for a Monroe Doctrine of literature. Contributions from
thinking men and women not connected with Stanford t'ni
versitv will be welcomed.
Stanford Criteria is forced to remind authors of one sty
listic requirement: In their articles, stories, and poems, con
tributors should not talk to themselves. While unwilling to
consider the lucid simplicity of the moron, Stanford Criteria
is even more fearful of the intellectual fan-dancing of those
who cultivate uninlelligibilitv for its own sake.
This first issue is not, perhaps, an exact indication of the
issues to follow. Contributions to this number have been lim
ited primarily to examination of the literary cosmos. Such a
limitation will not be applied in the future. Stanford Criteria
will continue to publish the best fiction, criticism, and verse
that can be secured, as well as to interest itself in the most
important problems of contemporary civilization. Discussions
of the theory of polities, art, and religion are invited, but
caution must be observed in the treatment of these subjects,
for articles should consist of intellectual analysis rather than
the declaration of emotional conviction about specific cases.
If by this time prospective readers are beginning to fear j
that the real concern of Stanford Criteria is to maintain an
austere solemnity, let them see the error of their ways. There
is no quality quite so necessary to the thinking man today as
a sense of humor. Without it he would soon be driven to j
insanity by the frequent horrors—and the intervening tedium
—which make up a great part of contemporarv America.
"The Books I Enjoyed Most"
Leading faculty members, representative of Stanford's
"expert opinion," contributed to the symposium printed in
other columns of this issue: "The Books I Enjoyed Most Dur- j
iug 19,11 is surprising to note how little agreement there!
is iu the selections. The result of this symposium once again ,
demonstrates the great diversity which exists between the j
opinions of reputable critics. The symposia conducted by the
New York Herald-Tribune during the past few years have j
resulted in similar confusions of answers.
Why is it, then, that literary critics often come to a :
unanimity of praise or condemnation in their reviews of in
dividual books? The paradox a fiords the key, perhaps, to one
of the serious llaws in American criticism—that of imitation, i
conscious or unconscious. Literary criticism in the United j
States may be divided according to frequency of publication:!
First, there are the book reviews and columns written for the
large metropolitan dailies; second, there are the comments!
printed in weekly periodicals, such as the Sunday literary 1
supplements to newspapers, and the Saturday Review of Lit-'
eraturc. The third critcial outlet is the field of monthly liter-!
ary magazines. The literary quarterlies, which are able to
survey books and trends with the detachment which a few
months' reflection allows, form a distinct group. The fifth j
division is made up of books on the wider aspects of literary
criticism.
II is almost impossible for the weekly reviewers to ignore
the reactions of the popular, though often incapable, daily)
newspaper reviewers. The monthly magazines of large na
tional circulation are often frankly imitative; their only use
is to correlate and disseminate the ideas of the weekly reviews, j
And the reviewers for quarterly periodicals, though they usu
ally ignore the observations of other critics, are frequently so
embroiled in literary politics that they have little opportunity i
to do much thinking for themselves.
It is apparent, then, that much of the book-reviewing
which is being done at the present time is imitative and irre
sponsible. This may account, in part, for the fact that when |
critics have a chance to read each other's reviews, they either
agree tacitly, or disagree violently, according to the position
in literary politics which they have adopted. In symposia,!
however, where opinions are expressed without knowledge I
of what others are going to say, an honest evaluation is j
reached. One may conclude that "best-sellers" and reviewers'
notwithstanding, there is no such tiling among responsible
peOple as the most popular book: certainly no such thing as i
the 1 best book. A. J. (i.
