# MISS WEBB—A Short Story
## 
### JAMES BROUGHTON 
I think we both felt a ripple of gratitude when Janet told
us she had a letter of introduction to Miss Webb. Not that we
were aware of a particular Miss Webb charm, but Hazel
(ireene and I would have appreciated having a letter to any
American who might actually be living here in the middle
ol Japan. Kinship toward one's countrymen grows strangely
omnivorous abroad.
.Janet, of course, was somewhat shy about introducing
j herself to Miss Webb, in spite of our enthusiasm. Janet was
a school teacher and inclined to be shy. She had apprehen
sively dropped all her Chinese letters of introduction out of
i the porthole before the ship docked at Hong Kong. But in
Kyoto she was more resigned to the inevitable, principally, I 1
j suppose, because she could not help herself. This Miss Webb
J lived at our hotel.
Janet finally persuaded herself to breakfast with Miss
Webb the next morning and get the business over. She met
us afterward with the compliments of Miss Webb in her hand
j—a day's itinerary of sight-seeing.
"You haven't told me yet what she was like. She's from j
I Philadelphia, but what else?" asked Hazel, the fat and jovial, j
as we drove to the Imperial Palaces. Hazel could never
smother her curiosity about new people, in spite of being a ,
school teacher.
"Oh, she's rather nice," said Janet, "but rather funny."
"Well, how old is she?" Hazel persisted.
"Oh, around thirty-five, I guess," said Janet, and if she
concealed further illuminating details, she was not going to:
reveal them. Hazel was forced to satisfy herself with Japa
nese art.
When we returned to the hotel for luncheon, drenched in
July humidity, Miss Webb appeared at our table after we had j
long been sealed. I noticed Janet gulping down her nervous
surprise, and Hazel's eyebrows leaping with anticipation. I
barely had lime to rise from mv chair before Miss Webb had (
slipped quickly into the vacant fourth chair without looking
at us, half-whispering toward Janet, "I thought you wouldn't !
mind—if I joined you." But I had seen her tall, droop-shoul
dered, formless figure, which seemed to hang together only :
precariously. j
"Oh, not at all," said .Janet, and she introduced us. Miss
Webb's eyes jumped back to the tablecloth as soon as they 1
had met ours. Their firm gravness, however, gave the only
accent to her pallid, bitten face.
"Well—" she began quickly, and her voice broke into a
harsh staccato giggle. An embarrassed silence skirted the
table. Janet could think of nothing to say; she was too busy
winding her napkin around her fingers. And Hazel was too
busy scrutinizing the unexpected guest. "Well " Miss Webb
tried again. Fortunately the Japanese girl came up to take
her order.
"I'll have — a chicken salad — and some tea," said Miss,
Webb, taking hold of the girl's kimono-sleeved arm as she (
spoke.
Hazel looked down around herself helplessly for a mo
ment, contemplating her plump contours and the dish of roast
chicken and baked bamboo shoots in which her fork rested.
Then she asked with concern and amazement, "Is that all
you're going to eat? Just a chicken salad?"
"Yes," said Miss Webb, pulling her shapeless panama
straight on her head with machine-gun fingers. "Isn't that
enough?"
"We're very grateful to you," said Janet anxiously, "for,
telling us where to go today. We wouldn't have known how 1
to go about seeing Kyoto at all." Hazel was staring at Miss
Webb again, oblivious to Janet's little facial signals of rebuke.
Miss Welib tried folding her hands on the tablecloth. "You i
must take rikishas—this afternoon —and see—Chion-in and;!
Heian-Jingu." When she raised the gray eyes to speak, they |
fluttered like the staccato giggles with which she ended every .
sentence. '
"We will," said Janet obediently and caught up her napkin
again.
"Are any one of you married?" Miss Webb demanded Avith
a sudden sharpness, almost catching back her giggles.
"No," said Janet hurriedly.
"That's good," said Miss Webb and folded her hands
again with evident relief.
"I'm not, but I certainly hope I gel a husband on this trip," ;
said Hazel, laughing out her punctuation marks. "That's one
of the reasons I came on a boat Ibis summer. We girls can't
go on like thin forever, you know. Somehow we don't seem to i
meet the right men in grammar schools, do we, Janet?"
Miss Webb tossed brief, thick disgust out of her gray eyes,
and Janet had difficulty in retrieving her smile.
"How long have you lived in Japan, Miss Webb?" I asked
gently.
"Since last October. Ten months." Her eves had difficulty-:
in focusing upon me. She seemed to prefer looking at her !
knuckles.
"Do you like it?" said Hazel, her amiability still running
high.
"I love it," said Miss Webb,
"You were in Hawaii before you came to Japan, weren't
you, Miss Webb?" asked Janet. "The girls who gave me the
letter to you said you lived there. How did von ever come to
leave it? It's so beautiful."
"Oh—Hawaii is so American. It's getting more American
all the time —too. And Japan's—further into the East—the
Far East."
The girl brought the chicken salad, and two other girls
brought bread and the tea. Miss Webb watched them, then
picked lip her fork and clung to it.
"Don't you think—the Japanese maidens are beautiful?"
she said to Janet. "They have such beautiful—skin and such
lovely—delicate features. I love to watch them. I do —often."
The air was pierced with staccato notes as though pellets were
being tossed against a window pane.
"You mean the waitresses?" asked Hazel.
"They are called maidens in Japan," said Miss Webb
severely.
"Oh, yes," said Janet, who had been thinking of Hawaiian
flowers as she ate her string beans and bamboo shoots. "You
did newspaper.work in Hawaii, didn't you?"
"Yes," said Miss Webb, very busy with her fork.
"And what do you do here?" asked Hazel, still staring at
Miss Webb.
"Oh —newspaper work —too," said Miss Webb. "1 write
correspondence—and book reviews—for the English paper."!
"Don't you ever get terribly lonely here?" Hazel went on. j
"I'm sure I would, with no parties or American movies or good
dance orchestras. Are there many Americans and British here
that you can have a good time with?"
A pale blush crossed Miss Webb's pinched face. "I don't
know any," she said.
"Well, what do you do for amusement? (Josh, I'd (lie* here
iu no lime without any American friends! You don't work
all Ihe lime, do you ?"

"Oh —no," said Miss Webb, stirring her tea into a liltlc*
whirlpool. "Oh —no. My work takes—very little time—really.
Well, frankly—" Her voice cracked for a moment, and tiny
bits of frightened, mirthless laughter broke around it. "Well,
frankly—l suppose you'd say—l live rather the life—of a
nun."
Hazel's brows formed a deep furrow, and she looked down
at her neglected roast chicken and bamboo shoots. Sympathy
surged within her.
"Hut don't you ever get homesick for New York or Phila
delphia?" she asked incredulously. ".Janet says you lived in
Philadelphia. Don't you ever want to go back there to buy
' some real American things once in a while, or go to some real
parties with real people?"
"No," said Miss Webb crisply, ber gray eyes Muttering over
the teacup. "No. I don't ever want —to go back. Only some
times—when I want to buy a pair of shoes—l think of it. No.
Japan is much —nicer. I have the religious—festivals to at
| lend. And then in April—there is the beautiful Cherry Dance
j when all—the maidens dance. It lasts a month. It is beautiful
I -—very beautiful."
Hazel started to speak, but Miss Webb was only caught
between staccato notes. "I want to go to —Peking—though,"
! she continued. "Perhaps—in a few years—l can go there to
: live." And she brought her voice down from the tight-rope
I wire.
Hazel opened her mouth to speak, but closed it again, and
: sat back in her chair, gazing at the tablecloth. Silence fell over
the table now. .Janet was Jinishing her string beans, and her
I quivering lingers made it a difficult achievement. It was my
; turn now.
"Miss Webb," I said, "1 wonder if you know a friend of
i my aunt's, who lived in Hawaii for some time. I met her only
I once, but you remind me of her. Lilian Greever. I believe
she's living- in Korea now."
"Lilian Greever? Oh yes—l know her." Miss Webb's voice
' was steadier and she almost managed a smile. "1 lived with
| ber at Punahou—for six months. I had a letter from her this
morning. She lives in India now."
She finished her chicken salad and caught her lingers to
i gethcr in a knot. "Well—" Her voice broke, and she wailed
a moment. Hazel had returned, after her dreamy interlude,
to the disposal of the roast chicken. .Janet had her napkin
around a finger once more. "Well—".said Miss Webb again,
passing her hands over her face quickly and placing them
against the edge of the table. "I must leave you."
"Are you going?" asked Janet.
I stood up hastily.
"This is Saturday. You don't have to work on Saturday
afternoon, do you?" said Hazel. "What are you going to do
this afternoon?"
Miss Webb was standing behind her chair now, pulling at
i her dress and fidgeting with her bag. "Oh," she said. "I'm
i going—up to my room. 1 may see you—about tea time." And
she walked swiftly, angularly, across the dining room and
disappeared.
"Can you imagine that?" asked Hazel. "I think she's very
funny."
"Oh, she's rather nice," said Janet.

as we drove to the Imperial Palaces. Hazel could never
smother her curiosity about new people, in spite of being a ,
school teacher.
"Oh, she's rather nice," said Janet, "but rather funny."
"Well, how old is she?" Hazel persisted.
"Oh, around thirty-five, I guess," said Janet, and if she
concealed further illuminating details, she was not going to:
reveal them. Hazel was forced to satisfy herself with Japa
nese art.
When we returned to the hotel for luncheon, drenched in
July humidity, Miss Webb appeared at our table after we had j
long been sealed. I noticed Janet gulping down her nervous
surprise, and Hazel's eyebrows leaping with anticipation. I
barely had lime to rise from mv chair before Miss Webb had (
slipped quickly into the vacant fourth chair without looking
at us, half-whispering toward Janet, "I thought you wouldn't !
mind—if I joined you." But I had seen her tall, droop-shoul
dered, formless figure, which seemed to hang together only :
precariously. j
"Oh, not at all," said .Janet, and she introduced us. Miss
Webb's eyes jumped back to the tablecloth as soon as they 1
had met ours. Their firm gravness, however, gave the only
accent to her pallid, bitten face.
"Well—" she began quickly, and her voice broke into a
harsh staccato giggle. An embarrassed silence skirted the
table. Janet could think of nothing to say; she was too busy
winding her napkin around her fingers. And Hazel was too
busy scrutinizing the unexpected guest. "Well " Miss Webb
tried again. Fortunately the Japanese girl came up to take
her order.
"I'll have — a chicken salad — and some tea," said Miss,
Webb, taking hold of the girl's kimono-sleeved arm as she (
spoke.
Hazel looked down around herself helplessly for a mo
ment, contemplating her plump contours and the dish of roast
chicken and baked bamboo shoots in which her fork rested.
Then she asked with concern and amazement, "Is that all
you're going to eat? Just a chicken salad?"
"Yes," said Miss Webb, pulling her shapeless panama
straight on her head with machine-gun fingers. "Isn't that
enough?"
"We're very grateful to you," said Janet anxiously, "for,
telling us where to go today. We wouldn't have known how 1
to go about seeing Kyoto at all." Hazel was staring at Miss
Webb again, oblivious to Janet's little facial signals of rebuke.
Miss Welib tried folding her hands on the tablecloth. "You i
must take rikishas—this afternoon —and see—Chion-in and;!
Heian-Jingu." When she raised the gray eyes to speak, they |
fluttered like the staccato giggles with which she ended every .
sentence. '
"We will," said Janet obediently and caught up her napkin
again.
"Are any one of you married?" Miss Webb demanded Avith
a sudden sharpness, almost catching back her giggles.
"No," said Janet hurriedly.
"That's good," said Miss Webb and folded her hands
again with evident relief.
"I'm not, but I certainly hope I gel a husband on this trip," ;
said Hazel, laughing out her punctuation marks. "That's one
of the reasons I came on a boat Ibis summer. We girls can't
go on like thin forever, you know. Somehow we don't seem to i
meet the right men in grammar schools, do we, Janet?"
Miss Webb tossed brief, thick disgust out of her gray eyes,
and Janet had difficulty in retrieving her smile.
"How long have you lived in Japan, Miss Webb?" I asked
gently.
"Since last October. Ten months." Her eves had difficulty-:
in focusing upon me. She seemed to prefer looking at her !
knuckles.
"Do you like it?" said Hazel, her amiability still running
high.
"I love it," said Miss Webb,
"You were in Hawaii before you came to Japan, weren't
you, Miss Webb?" asked Janet. "The girls who gave me the
letter to you said you lived there. How did von ever come to
leave it? It's so beautiful."
"Oh—Hawaii is so American. It's getting more American
all the time —too. And Japan's—further into the East—the
Far East."
The girl brought the chicken salad, and two other girls
brought bread and the tea. Miss Webb watched them, then
picked lip her fork and clung to it.
"Don't you think—the Japanese maidens are beautiful?"
she said to Janet. "They have such beautiful—skin and such
lovely—delicate features. I love to watch them. I do —often."
The air was pierced with staccato notes as though pellets were
being tossed against a window pane.
"You mean the waitresses?" asked Hazel.
"They are called maidens in Japan," said Miss Webb
severely.
"Oh, yes," said Janet, who had been thinking of Hawaiian
flowers as she ate her string beans and bamboo shoots. "You
did newspaper.work in Hawaii, didn't you?"
"Yes," said Miss Webb, very busy with her fork.
"And what do you do here?" asked Hazel, still staring at
Miss Webb.
"Oh —newspaper work —too," said Miss Webb. "1 write
correspondence—and book reviews—for the English paper."!
"Don't you ever get terribly lonely here?" Hazel went on. j
"I'm sure I would, with no parties or American movies or good
dance orchestras. Are there many Americans and British here
that you can have a good time with?"
A pale blush crossed Miss Webb's pinched face. "I don't
know any," she said.
"Well, what do you do for amusement? (Josh, I'd (lie* here
iu no lime without any American friends! You don't work
all Ihe lime, do you ?"

"Oh —no," said Miss Webb, stirring her tea into a liltlc*
whirlpool. "Oh —no. My work takes—very little time—really.
Well, frankly—" Her voice cracked for a moment, and tiny
bits of frightened, mirthless laughter broke around it. "Well,
frankly—l suppose you'd say—l live rather the life—of a
nun."
Hazel's brows formed a deep furrow, and she looked down
at her neglected roast chicken and bamboo shoots. Sympathy
surged within her.
"Hut don't you ever get homesick for New York or Phila
delphia?" she asked incredulously. ".Janet says you lived in
Philadelphia. Don't you ever want to go back there to buy
' some real American things once in a while, or go to some real
parties with real people?"
"No," said Miss Webb crisply, ber gray eyes Muttering over
the teacup. "No. I don't ever want —to go back. Only some
times—when I want to buy a pair of shoes—l think of it. No.
Japan is much —nicer. I have the religious—festivals to at
| lend. And then in April—there is the beautiful Cherry Dance
j when all—the maidens dance. It lasts a month. It is beautiful
I -—very beautiful."
Hazel started to speak, but Miss Webb was only caught
between staccato notes. "I want to go to —Peking—though,"
! she continued. "Perhaps—in a few years—l can go there to
: live." And she brought her voice down from the tight-rope
I wire.
Hazel opened her mouth to speak, but closed it again, and
: sat back in her chair, gazing at the tablecloth. Silence fell over
the table now. .Janet was Jinishing her string beans, and her
I quivering lingers made it a difficult achievement. It was my
; turn now.
"Miss Webb," I said, "1 wonder if you know a friend of
i my aunt's, who lived in Hawaii for some time. I met her only
I once, but you remind me of her. Lilian Greever. I believe
she's living- in Korea now."
"Lilian Greever? Oh yes—l know her." Miss Webb's voice
' was steadier and she almost managed a smile. "1 lived with
| ber at Punahou—for six months. I had a letter from her this
morning. She lives in India now."
She finished her chicken salad and caught her lingers to
i gethcr in a knot. "Well—" Her voice broke, and she wailed
a moment. Hazel had returned, after her dreamy interlude,
to the disposal of the roast chicken. .Janet had her napkin
around a finger once more. "Well—".said Miss Webb again,
passing her hands over her face quickly and placing them
against the edge of the table. "I must leave you."
"Are you going?" asked Janet.
I stood up hastily.
"This is Saturday. You don't have to work on Saturday
afternoon, do you?" said Hazel. "What are you going to do
this afternoon?"
Miss Webb was standing behind her chair now, pulling at
i her dress and fidgeting with her bag. "Oh," she said. "I'm
i going—up to my room. 1 may see you—about tea time." And
she walked swiftly, angularly, across the dining room and
disappeared.
"Can you imagine that?" asked Hazel. "I think she's very
funny."
"Oh, she's rather nice," said Janet.
,i t *
I think we both felt a ripple of gratitude when Janet told
us she had a letter of introduction to Miss Webb. Not that we
were aware of a particular Miss Webb charm, but Hazel
(ireene and I would have appreciated having a letter to any
American who might actually be living here in the middle
ol Japan. Kinship toward one's countrymen grows strangely
omnivorous abroad.
.Janet, of course, was somewhat shy about introducing
j herself to Miss Webb, in spite of our enthusiasm. Janet was
a school teacher and inclined to be shy. She had apprehen
sively dropped all her Chinese letters of introduction out of
i the porthole before the ship docked at Hong Kong. But in
Kyoto she was more resigned to the inevitable, principally, I 1
j suppose, because she could not help herself. This Miss Webb
J lived at our hotel.
Janet finally persuaded herself to breakfast with Miss
Webb the next morning and get the business over. She met
us afterward with the compliments of Miss Webb in her hand
j—a day's itinerary of sight-seeing.
"You haven't told me yet what she was like. She's from j
I Philadelphia, but what else?" asked Hazel, the fat and jovial, j
as we drove to the Imperial Palaces. Hazel could never

"Oh, not at all," said .Janet, and she introduced us. Miss
Webb's eyes jumped back to the tablecloth as soon as they 1
had met ours. Their firm gravness, however, gave the only
accent to her pallid, bitten face.
"Well—" she began quickly, and her voice broke into a
harsh staccato giggle. An embarrassed silence skirted the
table. Janet could think of nothing to say; she was too busy
winding her napkin around her fingers. And Hazel was too
busy scrutinizing the unexpected guest. "Well " Miss Webb
tried again. Fortunately the Japanese girl came up to take
her order.
"I'll have — a chicken salad — and some tea," said Miss,
Webb, taking hold of the girl's kimono-sleeved arm as she (
spoke.
Hazel looked down around herself helplessly for a mo
ment, contemplating her plump contours and the dish of roast
chicken and baked bamboo shoots in which her fork rested.
Then she asked with concern and amazement, "Is that all
you're going to eat? Just a chicken salad?"
"Yes," said Miss Webb, pulling her shapeless panama
straight on her head with machine-gun fingers. "Isn't that
enough?"
"We're very grateful to you," said Janet anxiously, "for,
telling us where to go today. We wouldn't have known how 1
to go about seeing Kyoto at all." Hazel was staring at Miss
Webb again, oblivious to Janet's little facial signals of rebuke.
Miss Welib tried folding her hands on the tablecloth. "You i
must take rikishas—this afternoon —and see—Chion-in and;!
Heian-Jingu." When she raised the gray eyes to speak, they |
fluttered like the staccato giggles with which she ended every .
sentence. '
"We will," said Janet obediently and caught up her napkin
again.
"Are any one of you married?" Miss Webb demanded Avith
a sudden sharpness, almost catching back her giggles.
"No," said Janet hurriedly.
"That's good," said Miss Webb and folded her hands
again with evident relief.
"I'm not, but I certainly hope I gel a husband on this trip," ;
said Hazel, laughing out her punctuation marks. "That's one
of the reasons I came on a boat Ibis summer. We girls can't
go on like thin forever, you know. Somehow we don't seem to i
meet the right men in grammar schools, do we, Janet?"
Miss Webb tossed brief, thick disgust out of her gray eyes,
and Janet had difficulty in retrieving her smile.
"How long have you lived in Japan, Miss Webb?" I asked
gently.
"Since last October. Ten months." Her eves had difficulty-:
in focusing upon me. She seemed to prefer looking at her !
knuckles.
"Do you like it?" said Hazel, her amiability still running
high.
"I love it," said Miss Webb,
"You were in Hawaii before you came to Japan, weren't
you, Miss Webb?" asked Janet. "The girls who gave me the
letter to you said you lived there. How did von ever come to
leave it? It's so beautiful."
"Oh—Hawaii is so American. It's getting more American
all the time —too. And Japan's—further into the East—the
Far East."
The girl brought the chicken salad, and two other girls
brought bread and the tea. Miss Webb watched them, then
picked lip her fork and clung to it.
"Don't you think—the Japanese maidens are beautiful?"
she said to Janet. "They have such beautiful—skin and such
lovely—delicate features. I love to watch them. I do —often."
The air was pierced with staccato notes as though pellets were
being tossed against a window pane.
"You mean the waitresses?" asked Hazel.
"They are called maidens in Japan," said Miss Webb
severely.
"Oh, yes," said Janet, who had been thinking of Hawaiian
flowers as she ate her string beans and bamboo shoots. "You
did newspaper.work in Hawaii, didn't you?"
"Yes," said Miss Webb, very busy with her fork.
"And what do you do here?" asked Hazel, still staring at
Miss Webb.
"Oh —newspaper work —too," said Miss Webb. "1 write
correspondence—and book reviews—for the English paper."!
"Don't you ever get terribly lonely here?" Hazel went on. j
"I'm sure I would, with no parties or American movies or good
dance orchestras. Are there many Americans and British here
that you can have a good time with?"
A pale blush crossed Miss Webb's pinched face. "I don't
know any," she said.
"Well, what do you do for amusement? (Josh, I'd (lie* here
iu no lime without any American friends! You don't work
all Ihe lime, do you ?"

"Oh —no," said Miss Webb, stirring her tea into a liltlc*
whirlpool. "Oh —no. My work takes—very little time—really.
Well, frankly—" Her voice cracked for a moment, and tiny
bits of frightened, mirthless laughter broke around it. "Well,
frankly—l suppose you'd say—l live rather the life—of a
nun."
Hazel's brows formed a deep furrow, and she looked down
at her neglected roast chicken and bamboo shoots. Sympathy
surged within her.
"Hut don't you ever get homesick for New York or Phila
delphia?" she asked incredulously. ".Janet says you lived in
Philadelphia. Don't you ever want to go back there to buy
' some real American things once in a while, or go to some real
parties with real people?"
"No," said Miss Webb crisply, ber gray eyes Muttering over
the teacup. "No. I don't ever want —to go back. Only some
times—when I want to buy a pair of shoes—l think of it. No.
Japan is much —nicer. I have the religious—festivals to at
| lend. And then in April—there is the beautiful Cherry Dance
j when all—the maidens dance. It lasts a month. It is beautiful
I -—very beautiful."
Hazel started to speak, but Miss Webb was only caught
between staccato notes. "I want to go to —Peking—though,"
! she continued. "Perhaps—in a few years—l can go there to
: live." And she brought her voice down from the tight-rope
I wire.
Hazel opened her mouth to speak, but closed it again, and
: sat back in her chair, gazing at the tablecloth. Silence fell over
the table now. .Janet was Jinishing her string beans, and her
I quivering lingers made it a difficult achievement. It was my
; turn now.
"Miss Webb," I said, "1 wonder if you know a friend of
i my aunt's, who lived in Hawaii for some time. I met her only
I once, but you remind me of her. Lilian Greever. I believe
she's living- in Korea now."
"Lilian Greever? Oh yes—l know her." Miss Webb's voice
' was steadier and she almost managed a smile. "1 lived with
| ber at Punahou—for six months. I had a letter from her this
morning. She lives in India now."
She finished her chicken salad and caught her lingers to
i gethcr in a knot. "Well—" Her voice broke, and she wailed
a moment. Hazel had returned, after her dreamy interlude,
to the disposal of the roast chicken. .Janet had her napkin
around a finger once more. "Well—".said Miss Webb again,
passing her hands over her face quickly and placing them
against the edge of the table. "I must leave you."
"Are you going?" asked Janet.
I stood up hastily.
"This is Saturday. You don't have to work on Saturday
afternoon, do you?" said Hazel. "What are you going to do
this afternoon?"
Miss Webb was standing behind her chair now, pulling at
i her dress and fidgeting with her bag. "Oh," she said. "I'm
i going—up to my room. 1 may see you—about tea time." And
she walked swiftly, angularly, across the dining room and
disappeared.
"Can you imagine that?" asked Hazel. "I think she's very
funny."
"Oh, she's rather nice," said Janet.
,i t *
I think we both felt a ripple of gratitude when Janet told
us she had a letter of introduction to Miss Webb. Not that we
were aware of a particular Miss Webb charm, but Hazel
(ireene and I would have appreciated having a letter to any
American who might actually be living here in the middle
ol Japan. Kinship toward one's countrymen grows strangely
omnivorous abroad.
.Janet, of course, was somewhat shy about introducing
j herself to Miss Webb, in spite of our enthusiasm. Janet was
a school teacher and inclined to be shy. She had apprehen
sively dropped all her Chinese letters of introduction out of
i the porthole before the ship docked at Hong Kong. But in
Kyoto she was more resigned to the inevitable, principally, I 1
j suppose, because she could not help herself. This Miss Webb
J lived at our hotel.
Janet finally persuaded herself to breakfast with Miss
Webb the next morning and get the business over. She met
us afterward with the compliments of Miss Webb in her hand
j—a day's itinerary of sight-seeing.
"You haven't told me yet what she was like. She's from j
I Philadelphia, but what else?" asked Hazel, the fat and jovial, j
as we drove to the Imperial Palaces. Hazel could never
smother her curiosity about new people, in spite of being a ,
school teacher.
"Oh, she's rather nice," said Janet, "but rather funny."
"Well, how old is she?" Hazel persisted.
"Oh, around thirty-five, I guess," said Janet, and if she
concealed further illuminating details, she was not going to:
reveal them. Hazel was forced to satisfy herself with Japa
nese art.
When we returned to the hotel for luncheon, drenched in
July humidity, Miss Webb appeared at our table after we had j
long been sealed. I noticed Janet gulping down her nervous
surprise, and Hazel's eyebrows leaping with anticipation. I
barely had lime to rise from mv chair before Miss Webb had (
slipped quickly into the vacant fourth chair without looking
at us, half-whispering toward Janet, "I thought you wouldn't !
mind—if I joined you." But I had seen her tall, droop-shoul
dered, formless figure, which seemed to hang together only :
precariously. j
"Oh, not at all," said .Janet, and she introduced us. Miss
Webb's eyes jumped back to the tablecloth as soon as they 1

enough?"
"We're very grateful to you," said Janet anxiously, "for,
telling us where to go today. We wouldn't have known how 1
to go about seeing Kyoto at all." Hazel was staring at Miss
Webb again, oblivious to Janet's little facial signals of rebuke.
Miss Welib tried folding her hands on the tablecloth. "You i
must take rikishas—this afternoon —and see—Chion-in and;!
Heian-Jingu." When she raised the gray eyes to speak, they |
fluttered like the staccato giggles with which she ended every .
sentence. '
"We will," said Janet obediently and caught up her napkin
again.
"Are any one of you married?" Miss Webb demanded Avith
a sudden sharpness, almost catching back her giggles.
"No," said Janet hurriedly.
"That's good," said Miss Webb and folded her hands
again with evident relief.
"I'm not, but I certainly hope I gel a husband on this trip," ;
said Hazel, laughing out her punctuation marks. "That's one
of the reasons I came on a boat Ibis summer. We girls can't
go on like thin forever, you know. Somehow we don't seem to i
meet the right men in grammar schools, do we, Janet?"
Miss Webb tossed brief, thick disgust out of her gray eyes,
and Janet had difficulty in retrieving her smile.
"How long have you lived in Japan, Miss Webb?" I asked
gently.
"Since last October. Ten months." Her eves had difficulty-:
in focusing upon me. She seemed to prefer looking at her !
knuckles.
"Do you like it?" said Hazel, her amiability still running
high.
"I love it," said Miss Webb,
"You were in Hawaii before you came to Japan, weren't
you, Miss Webb?" asked Janet. "The girls who gave me the
letter to you said you lived there. How did von ever come to
leave it? It's so beautiful."
"Oh—Hawaii is so American. It's getting more American
all the time —too. And Japan's—further into the East—the
Far East."
The girl brought the chicken salad, and two other girls
brought bread and the tea. Miss Webb watched them, then
picked lip her fork and clung to it.
"Don't you think—the Japanese maidens are beautiful?"
she said to Janet. "They have such beautiful—skin and such
lovely—delicate features. I love to watch them. I do —often."
The air was pierced with staccato notes as though pellets were
being tossed against a window pane.
"You mean the waitresses?" asked Hazel.
"They are called maidens in Japan," said Miss Webb
severely.
"Oh, yes," said Janet, who had been thinking of Hawaiian
flowers as she ate her string beans and bamboo shoots. "You
did newspaper.work in Hawaii, didn't you?"
"Yes," said Miss Webb, very busy with her fork.
"And what do you do here?" asked Hazel, still staring at
Miss Webb.
"Oh —newspaper work —too," said Miss Webb. "1 write
correspondence—and book reviews—for the English paper."!
"Don't you ever get terribly lonely here?" Hazel went on. j
"I'm sure I would, with no parties or American movies or good
dance orchestras. Are there many Americans and British here
that you can have a good time with?"
A pale blush crossed Miss Webb's pinched face. "I don't
know any," she said.
"Well, what do you do for amusement? (Josh, I'd (lie* here
iu no lime without any American friends! You don't work
all Ihe lime, do you ?"

"Oh —no," said Miss Webb, stirring her tea into a liltlc*
whirlpool. "Oh —no. My work takes—very little time—really.
Well, frankly—" Her voice cracked for a moment, and tiny
bits of frightened, mirthless laughter broke around it. "Well,
frankly—l suppose you'd say—l live rather the life—of a
nun."
Hazel's brows formed a deep furrow, and she looked down
at her neglected roast chicken and bamboo shoots. Sympathy
surged within her.
"Hut don't you ever get homesick for New York or Phila
delphia?" she asked incredulously. ".Janet says you lived in
Philadelphia. Don't you ever want to go back there to buy
' some real American things once in a while, or go to some real
parties with real people?"
"No," said Miss Webb crisply, ber gray eyes Muttering over
the teacup. "No. I don't ever want —to go back. Only some
times—when I want to buy a pair of shoes—l think of it. No.
Japan is much —nicer. I have the religious—festivals to at
| lend. And then in April—there is the beautiful Cherry Dance
j when all—the maidens dance. It lasts a month. It is beautiful
I -—very beautiful."
Hazel started to speak, but Miss Webb was only caught
between staccato notes. "I want to go to —Peking—though,"
! she continued. "Perhaps—in a few years—l can go there to
: live." And she brought her voice down from the tight-rope
I wire.
Hazel opened her mouth to speak, but closed it again, and
: sat back in her chair, gazing at the tablecloth. Silence fell over
the table now. .Janet was Jinishing her string beans, and her
I quivering lingers made it a difficult achievement. It was my
; turn now.
"Miss Webb," I said, "1 wonder if you know a friend of
i my aunt's, who lived in Hawaii for some time. I met her only
I once, but you remind me of her. Lilian Greever. I believe
she's living- in Korea now."
"Lilian Greever? Oh yes—l know her." Miss Webb's voice
' was steadier and she almost managed a smile. "1 lived with
| ber at Punahou—for six months. I had a letter from her this
morning. She lives in India now."
She finished her chicken salad and caught her lingers to
i gethcr in a knot. "Well—" Her voice broke, and she wailed
a moment. Hazel had returned, after her dreamy interlude,
to the disposal of the roast chicken. .Janet had her napkin
around a finger once more. "Well—".said Miss Webb again,
passing her hands over her face quickly and placing them
against the edge of the table. "I must leave you."
"Are you going?" asked Janet.
I stood up hastily.
"This is Saturday. You don't have to work on Saturday
afternoon, do you?" said Hazel. "What are you going to do
this afternoon?"
Miss Webb was standing behind her chair now, pulling at
i her dress and fidgeting with her bag. "Oh," she said. "I'm
i going—up to my room. 1 may see you—about tea time." And
she walked swiftly, angularly, across the dining room and
disappeared.
"Can you imagine that?" asked Hazel. "I think she's very
funny."
"Oh, she's rather nice," said Janet.
,i t *
I think we both felt a ripple of gratitude when Janet told
us she had a letter of introduction to Miss Webb. Not that we
were aware of a particular Miss Webb charm, but Hazel
(ireene and I would have appreciated having a letter to any
American who might actually be living here in the middle
ol Japan. Kinship toward one's countrymen grows strangely
omnivorous abroad.
.Janet, of course, was somewhat shy about introducing
j herself to Miss Webb, in spite of our enthusiasm. Janet was
a school teacher and inclined to be shy. She had apprehen
sively dropped all her Chinese letters of introduction out of
i the porthole before the ship docked at Hong Kong. But in
Kyoto she was more resigned to the inevitable, principally, I 1
j suppose, because she could not help herself. This Miss Webb
J lived at our hotel.
Janet finally persuaded herself to breakfast with Miss
Webb the next morning and get the business over. She met
us afterward with the compliments of Miss Webb in her hand
j—a day's itinerary of sight-seeing.
"You haven't told me yet what she was like. She's from j
I Philadelphia, but what else?" asked Hazel, the fat and jovial, j
as we drove to the Imperial Palaces. Hazel could never
smother her curiosity about new people, in spite of being a ,
school teacher.
"Oh, she's rather nice," said Janet, "but rather funny."
"Well, how old is she?" Hazel persisted.
"Oh, around thirty-five, I guess," said Janet, and if she
concealed further illuminating details, she was not going to:
reveal them. Hazel was forced to satisfy herself with Japa
nese art.
When we returned to the hotel for luncheon, drenched in
July humidity, Miss Webb appeared at our table after we had j
long been sealed. I noticed Janet gulping down her nervous
surprise, and Hazel's eyebrows leaping with anticipation. I
barely had lime to rise from mv chair before Miss Webb had (
slipped quickly into the vacant fourth chair without looking
at us, half-whispering toward Janet, "I thought you wouldn't !
mind—if I joined you." But I had seen her tall, droop-shoul
dered, formless figure, which seemed to hang together only :
precariously. j
"Oh, not at all," said .Janet, and she introduced us. Miss
Webb's eyes jumped back to the tablecloth as soon as they 1
had met ours. Their firm gravness, however, gave the only
accent to her pallid, bitten face.
"Well—" she began quickly, and her voice broke into a
harsh staccato giggle. An embarrassed silence skirted the
table. Janet could think of nothing to say; she was too busy
winding her napkin around her fingers. And Hazel was too
busy scrutinizing the unexpected guest. "Well " Miss Webb
tried again. Fortunately the Japanese girl came up to take
her order.
"I'll have — a chicken salad — and some tea," said Miss,
Webb, taking hold of the girl's kimono-sleeved arm as she (
spoke.
Hazel looked down around herself helplessly for a mo
ment, contemplating her plump contours and the dish of roast
chicken and baked bamboo shoots in which her fork rested.
Then she asked with concern and amazement, "Is that all
you're going to eat? Just a chicken salad?"
"Yes," said Miss Webb, pulling her shapeless panama
straight on her head with machine-gun fingers. "Isn't that
enough?"
"We're very grateful to you," said Janet anxiously, "for,

go on like thin forever, you know. Somehow we don't seem to i
meet the right men in grammar schools, do we, Janet?"
Miss Webb tossed brief, thick disgust out of her gray eyes,
and Janet had difficulty in retrieving her smile.
"How long have you lived in Japan, Miss Webb?" I asked
gently.
"Since last October. Ten months." Her eves had difficulty-:
in focusing upon me. She seemed to prefer looking at her !
knuckles.
"Do you like it?" said Hazel, her amiability still running
high.
"I love it," said Miss Webb,
"You were in Hawaii before you came to Japan, weren't
you, Miss Webb?" asked Janet. "The girls who gave me the
letter to you said you lived there. How did von ever come to
leave it? It's so beautiful."
"Oh—Hawaii is so American. It's getting more American
all the time —too. And Japan's—further into the East—the
Far East."
The girl brought the chicken salad, and two other girls
brought bread and the tea. Miss Webb watched them, then
picked lip her fork and clung to it.
"Don't you think—the Japanese maidens are beautiful?"
she said to Janet. "They have such beautiful—skin and such
lovely—delicate features. I love to watch them. I do —often."
The air was pierced with staccato notes as though pellets were
being tossed against a window pane.
"You mean the waitresses?" asked Hazel.
"They are called maidens in Japan," said Miss Webb
severely.
"Oh, yes," said Janet, who had been thinking of Hawaiian
flowers as she ate her string beans and bamboo shoots. "You
did newspaper.work in Hawaii, didn't you?"
"Yes," said Miss Webb, very busy with her fork.
"And what do you do here?" asked Hazel, still staring at
Miss Webb.
"Oh —newspaper work —too," said Miss Webb. "1 write
correspondence—and book reviews—for the English paper."!
"Don't you ever get terribly lonely here?" Hazel went on. j
"I'm sure I would, with no parties or American movies or good
dance orchestras. Are there many Americans and British here
that you can have a good time with?"
A pale blush crossed Miss Webb's pinched face. "I don't
know any," she said.
"Well, what do you do for amusement? (Josh, I'd (lie* here
iu no lime without any American friends! You don't work
all Ihe lime, do you ?"

"Oh —no," said Miss Webb, stirring her tea into a liltlc*
whirlpool. "Oh —no. My work takes—very little time—really.
Well, frankly—" Her voice cracked for a moment, and tiny
bits of frightened, mirthless laughter broke around it. "Well,
frankly—l suppose you'd say—l live rather the life—of a
nun."
Hazel's brows formed a deep furrow, and she looked down
at her neglected roast chicken and bamboo shoots. Sympathy
surged within her.
"Hut don't you ever get homesick for New York or Phila
delphia?" she asked incredulously. ".Janet says you lived in
Philadelphia. Don't you ever want to go back there to buy
' some real American things once in a while, or go to some real
parties with real people?"
"No," said Miss Webb crisply, ber gray eyes Muttering over
the teacup. "No. I don't ever want —to go back. Only some
times—when I want to buy a pair of shoes—l think of it. No.
Japan is much —nicer. I have the religious—festivals to at
| lend. And then in April—there is the beautiful Cherry Dance
j when all—the maidens dance. It lasts a month. It is beautiful
I -—very beautiful."
Hazel started to speak, but Miss Webb was only caught
between staccato notes. "I want to go to —Peking—though,"
! she continued. "Perhaps—in a few years—l can go there to
: live." And she brought her voice down from the tight-rope
I wire.
Hazel opened her mouth to speak, but closed it again, and
: sat back in her chair, gazing at the tablecloth. Silence fell over
the table now. .Janet was Jinishing her string beans, and her
I quivering lingers made it a difficult achievement. It was my
; turn now.
"Miss Webb," I said, "1 wonder if you know a friend of
i my aunt's, who lived in Hawaii for some time. I met her only
I once, but you remind me of her. Lilian Greever. I believe
she's living- in Korea now."
"Lilian Greever? Oh yes—l know her." Miss Webb's voice
' was steadier and she almost managed a smile. "1 lived with
| ber at Punahou—for six months. I had a letter from her this
morning. She lives in India now."
She finished her chicken salad and caught her lingers to
i gethcr in a knot. "Well—" Her voice broke, and she wailed
a moment. Hazel had returned, after her dreamy interlude,
to the disposal of the roast chicken. .Janet had her napkin
around a finger once more. "Well—".said Miss Webb again,
passing her hands over her face quickly and placing them
against the edge of the table. "I must leave you."
"Are you going?" asked Janet.
I stood up hastily.
"This is Saturday. You don't have to work on Saturday
afternoon, do you?" said Hazel. "What are you going to do
this afternoon?"
Miss Webb was standing behind her chair now, pulling at
i her dress and fidgeting with her bag. "Oh," she said. "I'm
i going—up to my room. 1 may see you—about tea time." And
she walked swiftly, angularly, across the dining room and
disappeared.
"Can you imagine that?" asked Hazel. "I think she's very
funny."
"Oh, she's rather nice," said Janet.
,i t *
I think we both felt a ripple of gratitude when Janet told
us she had a letter of introduction to Miss Webb. Not that we
were aware of a particular Miss Webb charm, but Hazel
(ireene and I would have appreciated having a letter to any
American who might actually be living here in the middle
ol Japan. Kinship toward one's countrymen grows strangely
omnivorous abroad.
.Janet, of course, was somewhat shy about introducing
j herself to Miss Webb, in spite of our enthusiasm. Janet was
a school teacher and inclined to be shy. She had apprehen
sively dropped all her Chinese letters of introduction out of
i the porthole before the ship docked at Hong Kong. But in
Kyoto she was more resigned to the inevitable, principally, I 1
j suppose, because she could not help herself. This Miss Webb
J lived at our hotel.
Janet finally persuaded herself to breakfast with Miss
Webb the next morning and get the business over. She met
us afterward with the compliments of Miss Webb in her hand
j—a day's itinerary of sight-seeing.
"You haven't told me yet what she was like. She's from j
I Philadelphia, but what else?" asked Hazel, the fat and jovial, j
as we drove to the Imperial Palaces. Hazel could never
smother her curiosity about new people, in spite of being a ,
school teacher.
"Oh, she's rather nice," said Janet, "but rather funny."
"Well, how old is she?" Hazel persisted.
"Oh, around thirty-five, I guess," said Janet, and if she
concealed further illuminating details, she was not going to:
reveal them. Hazel was forced to satisfy herself with Japa
nese art.
When we returned to the hotel for luncheon, drenched in
July humidity, Miss Webb appeared at our table after we had j
long been sealed. I noticed Janet gulping down her nervous
surprise, and Hazel's eyebrows leaping with anticipation. I
barely had lime to rise from mv chair before Miss Webb had (
slipped quickly into the vacant fourth chair without looking
at us, half-whispering toward Janet, "I thought you wouldn't !
mind—if I joined you." But I had seen her tall, droop-shoul
dered, formless figure, which seemed to hang together only :
precariously. j
"Oh, not at all," said .Janet, and she introduced us. Miss
Webb's eyes jumped back to the tablecloth as soon as they 1
had met ours. Their firm gravness, however, gave the only
accent to her pallid, bitten face.
"Well—" she began quickly, and her voice broke into a
harsh staccato giggle. An embarrassed silence skirted the
table. Janet could think of nothing to say; she was too busy
winding her napkin around her fingers. And Hazel was too
busy scrutinizing the unexpected guest. "Well " Miss Webb
tried again. Fortunately the Japanese girl came up to take
her order.
"I'll have — a chicken salad — and some tea," said Miss,
Webb, taking hold of the girl's kimono-sleeved arm as she (
spoke.
Hazel looked down around herself helplessly for a mo
ment, contemplating her plump contours and the dish of roast
chicken and baked bamboo shoots in which her fork rested.
Then she asked with concern and amazement, "Is that all
you're going to eat? Just a chicken salad?"
"Yes," said Miss Webb, pulling her shapeless panama
straight on her head with machine-gun fingers. "Isn't that
enough?"
"We're very grateful to you," said Janet anxiously, "for,
telling us where to go today. We wouldn't have known how 1
to go about seeing Kyoto at all." Hazel was staring at Miss
Webb again, oblivious to Janet's little facial signals of rebuke.
Miss Welib tried folding her hands on the tablecloth. "You i
must take rikishas—this afternoon —and see—Chion-in and;!
Heian-Jingu." When she raised the gray eyes to speak, they |
fluttered like the staccato giggles with which she ended every .
sentence. '
"We will," said Janet obediently and caught up her napkin
again.
"Are any one of you married?" Miss Webb demanded Avith
a sudden sharpness, almost catching back her giggles.
"No," said Janet hurriedly.
"That's good," said Miss Webb and folded her hands
again with evident relief.
"I'm not, but I certainly hope I gel a husband on this trip," ;
said Hazel, laughing out her punctuation marks. "That's one
of the reasons I came on a boat Ibis summer. We girls can't
go on like thin forever, you know. Somehow we don't seem to i
meet the right men in grammar schools, do we, Janet?"
