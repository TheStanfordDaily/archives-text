(J. B. Lippincott). 1933. *2.
The delightful, informal narrative of Robert and Elizabeth
along willl selected poems from the two Brownings, annotated
by pertinent comments, make this new book by Stanford's
Mrs. Russell especially appealing as an introduction to these
two great Victorian poets. Intended especially for children in
their approach to the Drownings, "Two Poets, a Dog and a
Hoy" is significant because of its simple, charming style and
accurate though unpcdantic presentation of the poets, and
about forty of their poems.
It is significant that Mrs. Russell, a noted authority on the
Brownings, has written a book primarily to help young people,
appreciate these mature poets and understand the subtleties
and obscurities in some of Robert Browning's poems. Her se
lection of the poems from both poets is intelligent and ju
dicious, and the brief, direct notes and interpretations pre
ceding each poem are invaluable to adults as well as younger
readers. These poems, according to Mrs. Russell, furnish the
best kind of poetry for the young because they were not com
posed especially for them, but were the natural expression of
the feelings of two great poets.
The sympathetic story of Elizabeth Barrett's childhood,
her later confining illness, the devotion between her and her
dog Flush, along with the story of Robert Browning's youth,
his romantic entrance into her life, their marriage and happy
years in Italy where their son, Penini, was born, reads like an
absorbing novel that one cannot put aside until finished. Any
one starting the stimulating, colorful prose of the tirst para
graph will feel the fascination, and read on with increasing
pleasure until the end of those two complete ami harmonious
lives is reached.
Because Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett comple
ment one another in many of their traits, interests, and in
their types of poetry, it is especially valuable to find selections
from both and the life of each intelligently presented and in
terpreted in one attractive volume.
A Stanford graduate, Gary Odell, adds to the charm of the
book with his five lull-page illustrations of scenes from the
life of the Brownings.
"Two Poets, a Dog and a Boy" would be an ideal and val
uable Ghristmas gift for any young person.

Poor Splendid Wings, by Fhanci:s Wiwvak. (Boston: Little,
Brown & Go.) 1933. $3.50.
The meager medievalism of the now much-maligned Pre-
Raphaelite movement in art had as its protagonists a nucleus
of unusual, pathetic, diverse artists. Their significance to
painting was of a mere groping transition toward the freedom
of modern art. To a modern world, interest focuses upon
their lives and their writings.
Valiant Bohcmianism in conflict with the strict morality
of Victorian England produced the pathological eroticism of
Gabriel Rossetti, the grotesque perversities of Swinburne, the
inhibited loves of Ghristina Rossetti, the tortuous neurosis of
Raskin. Miss Winwar avoids a discussion of the value of the
movement and concentrates upon weaving a contiguous pat
tern of the comedies and tragedies, enthusiasms and frustra
tions, of her individual personalities. And she makes their
biographies read like an exciting novel.
The pitying title of the book expresses Miss Win war's
sympathetic admiration for Gabriel Rossetti, upon whom she
centers her attention, although Morris and Burne-.lones were
doubtless more directly responsible for the development of
the movement. In her lender portrayal of Rossetti, Miss Win
war takes variance from Evelyn Waugh and makes a near
tragic figure of him. However, the tragic stories of the two
women, Ghristina Rossetti and Lizzie Siddall, remain the most
poignantly haunting of all the lives in this tangle of frenzied
saints and sinners.
On the whole Miss Winwar keeps her threads well-knit,
although there must inevitably be abrupt gaps where her
colorful dramatis personae—which also includes Millais, Ford
Madox Brown, Meredith, and Whistler —pursued divergent
paths. She has given us a vivid picture of the Pre-Raphaelites
in their unique dramas, and though her style is often too
flowery, her scholarship is sound and delightfully human.

of modern art. To a modern world, interest focuses upon
their lives and their writings.
Valiant Bohcmianism in conflict with the strict morality
of Victorian England produced the pathological eroticism of
Gabriel Rossetti, the grotesque perversities of Swinburne, the
inhibited loves of Ghristina Rossetti, the tortuous neurosis of
Raskin. Miss Winwar avoids a discussion of the value of the
movement and concentrates upon weaving a contiguous pat
tern of the comedies and tragedies, enthusiasms and frustra
tions, of her individual personalities. And she makes their
biographies read like an exciting novel.
The pitying title of the book expresses Miss Win war's
sympathetic admiration for Gabriel Rossetti, upon whom she
centers her attention, although Morris and Burne-.lones were
doubtless more directly responsible for the development of
the movement. In her lender portrayal of Rossetti, Miss Win
war takes variance from Evelyn Waugh and makes a near
tragic figure of him. However, the tragic stories of the two
women, Ghristina Rossetti and Lizzie Siddall, remain the most
poignantly haunting of all the lives in this tangle of frenzied
saints and sinners.
On the whole Miss Winwar keeps her threads well-knit,
although there must inevitably be abrupt gaps where her
colorful dramatis personae—which also includes Millais, Ford
Madox Brown, Meredith, and Whistler —pursued divergent
paths. She has given us a vivid picture of the Pre-Raphaelites
in their unique dramas, and though her style is often too
flowery, her scholarship is sound and delightfully human.

The delightful, informal narrative of Robert and Elizabeth
along willl selected poems from the two Brownings, annotated
by pertinent comments, make this new book by Stanford's
Mrs. Russell especially appealing as an introduction to these
two great Victorian poets. Intended especially for children in
their approach to the Drownings, "Two Poets, a Dog and a
Hoy" is significant because of its simple, charming style and
accurate though unpcdantic presentation of the poets, and
about forty of their poems.
It is significant that Mrs. Russell, a noted authority on the
Brownings, has written a book primarily to help young people,
appreciate these mature poets and understand the subtleties
and obscurities in some of Robert Browning's poems. Her se
lection of the poems from both poets is intelligent and ju
dicious, and the brief, direct notes and interpretations pre
ceding each poem are invaluable to adults as well as younger
readers. These poems, according to Mrs. Russell, furnish the
best kind of poetry for the young because they were not com
posed especially for them, but were the natural expression of
the feelings of two great poets.
The sympathetic story of Elizabeth Barrett's childhood,
her later confining illness, the devotion between her and her
dog Flush, along with the story of Robert Browning's youth,
his romantic entrance into her life, their marriage and happy
years in Italy where their son, Penini, was born, reads like an
absorbing novel that one cannot put aside until finished. Any
one starting the stimulating, colorful prose of the tirst para
graph will feel the fascination, and read on with increasing
pleasure until the end of those two complete ami harmonious
lives is reached.
Because Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett comple
ment one another in many of their traits, interests, and in
their types of poetry, it is especially valuable to find selections
from both and the life of each intelligently presented and in
terpreted in one attractive volume.
A Stanford graduate, Gary Odell, adds to the charm of the
book with his five lull-page illustrations of scenes from the
life of the Brownings.
