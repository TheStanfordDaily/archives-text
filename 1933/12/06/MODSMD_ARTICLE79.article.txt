# BELLS AND LILIES
## 
### GRAHAM MUNRO 
It would be fascinating and often sad to follow through
life the heroes and heroines of romance. Charlotte, for whom
voting Werther wished to commit suicide, arouses no thrill
in Goethe when, as a stout commonplace matron, she appears
before the high court official, the clean of European letters,
the Olympian.
What has become, we ask, of the charming young English
poetess and "aesthete," Vivian Bell, whom Anatole France
pictures rather ironically in Le Lijs Ruiuje? 1 can tell you, for
1 have seen her in the intimate atmosphere of her own home.
More than forty years have passed since Therese and
Dechartrc, looking out over Florence from the rose-covered
terrace of Vivian Hell's home in Fiesole, felt the pitiless call
of passion. The "red lilies" have blossomed and faded many,
many summers in that exquisite garden in Tuscany. Hut in
May, in Paris, on a window sill overlooking the garden of the
former Convent ties Oiscaux, behind which rises the tarnished
dome of the Invalides, can be seen a pot of the loveliest, most
delicate Lilies of the Valley, and above them, inhaling their
fragrance, bends the delicate head of Vivian Hell. We regret
that the great master is not here to picture her to the world
as she now is, and to atone for the dash of mockery in his
affectionate portrait of the poetess.
Vivian Hell, then Mary Robinson, now Madame Duclaux,
although seventy-four years old, cannot be called an old lady.
She is the eternally young woman, still "the girl with the
wonderful eyes."
Life and love have both come by. Therese, you remember,
exclaimed, when silting one evening with Vivian by the cosy
boudoir fire: "Cherie, there is no man in the world exquisite
and 'delicate' enough for you." Hut two very distinguished
savants wooed and won her. The Orientalist, James Dunnes*
letlcr, in far-away India, recognized in the poetess a kindred
spirit. He came to pay homage to the artist, and found a
woman to whom he olTered his love. After only a few years
of life together, death took the great scholar. . . . Quite a
few years later, she married Emilc Duclaux, the scientist, suc
cessor to Pasteur. Perhaps it was through her close associa
tion with these two painstaking men that the author of poems
called A Handful of Honeysuckle acquired those habits of
patient investigation which enabled her to write, not only a
delightful History of France, but to interpret in sympathetic
biographies the lives of several of France's greatest men, Ke
nan, Victor Hugo, Racine, Pascal.
"If some one loves you, and you love him, do what you
believe you must do: but do not mix up with love the interests
and material arrangements that have nothing to do with sen
timent." When she received Ibis piece of advice from Therese,
Vivian Hell blushed deeply: she was shocked. This same girl,
as Madame Duclaux, could relate with delicate sympathy the
lifty-year-long attachment of Victor Hugo and Juliette Drouet.
But it is as a charming woman, not as a writer, I like best
to remember her. Surrounding her in her salon are the sou
venirs of a lifetime, paintings from Florence, bells from Assisi,
portraits of dear and near ones. The light shining through
golden curtains falls on a low table covered with copies of the
latest books dedicated to her, Clinuits, by Maurois, Michelet,
by Daniel Halevy . . . Sunday afternoons, her little salon is
thronged with a group of young writers who come, not to wor
ship, but to tell their hopes and their ambitious to this elder
sister of French letters.
Quite young people are there too. How I wish I could pic
ture her to you as she pours out tea to me and my children:
the bird-like poise of, the little head; the waving while hair
conlincd by a coquettish black velvet band; the soft grey satin
ribbon clasped with a pearl around the delicate throat; the
linely embroidered while vest disappearing beneath the folds
which cover the still girlish bust. Yes: perhaps there is still
in all this the trace of the conscious artist, Vivian Hell. Hut
it is not the aesthete, it is the woman taught by love, who
enters so sympathetically into all the small problems of our
lives. She has not even forgotten that American boys like
plumcake. Giving tea and toast to five or six people is at best
a distracting task; but this hostess, whilst holding the richly
carved teapot far too heavy for the little wrist, continues in
silver tones to discuss with easy mastery the varied problems
of art and literature. I see my boy's eyes taking on a far-oil'
expression. Perhaps, alter all, it might be more wonderful to
write a book which would thrill than to be the Cotton King he
had always dreamed to be. Just there is the greatest contribu
tion of Mary Robinson, the poet, and of Madame Duclaux, the
historian and biographer: she is a wonderful inspircr of
youth. She points out the better way. She shows that art
must be the center of life. She ushers into the realm of the
spirit.
Life is gayer in this little salon of the Rue de Varenne than
in the palace of Ihe Champs-Elysees. It is a joy to have seen
this exquisite white lily, so different from the llaming red
one which bled over Therese's heart. Life has its revenge:
where is Therese?

terrace of Vivian Hell's home in Fiesole, felt the pitiless call
of passion. The "red lilies" have blossomed and faded many,
many summers in that exquisite garden in Tuscany. Hut in
May, in Paris, on a window sill overlooking the garden of the
former Convent ties Oiscaux, behind which rises the tarnished
dome of the Invalides, can be seen a pot of the loveliest, most
delicate Lilies of the Valley, and above them, inhaling their
fragrance, bends the delicate head of Vivian Hell. We regret
that the great master is not here to picture her to the world
as she now is, and to atone for the dash of mockery in his
affectionate portrait of the poetess.
Vivian Hell, then Mary Robinson, now Madame Duclaux,
although seventy-four years old, cannot be called an old lady.
She is the eternally young woman, still "the girl with the
wonderful eyes."
Life and love have both come by. Therese, you remember,
exclaimed, when silting one evening with Vivian by the cosy
boudoir fire: "Cherie, there is no man in the world exquisite
and 'delicate' enough for you." Hut two very distinguished
savants wooed and won her. The Orientalist, James Dunnes*
letlcr, in far-away India, recognized in the poetess a kindred
spirit. He came to pay homage to the artist, and found a
woman to whom he olTered his love. After only a few years
of life together, death took the great scholar. . . . Quite a
few years later, she married Emilc Duclaux, the scientist, suc
cessor to Pasteur. Perhaps it was through her close associa
tion with these two painstaking men that the author of poems
called A Handful of Honeysuckle acquired those habits of
patient investigation which enabled her to write, not only a
delightful History of France, but to interpret in sympathetic
biographies the lives of several of France's greatest men, Ke
nan, Victor Hugo, Racine, Pascal.
"If some one loves you, and you love him, do what you
believe you must do: but do not mix up with love the interests
and material arrangements that have nothing to do with sen
timent." When she received Ibis piece of advice from Therese,
Vivian Hell blushed deeply: she was shocked. This same girl,
as Madame Duclaux, could relate with delicate sympathy the
lifty-year-long attachment of Victor Hugo and Juliette Drouet.
But it is as a charming woman, not as a writer, I like best
to remember her. Surrounding her in her salon are the sou
venirs of a lifetime, paintings from Florence, bells from Assisi,
portraits of dear and near ones. The light shining through
golden curtains falls on a low table covered with copies of the
latest books dedicated to her, Clinuits, by Maurois, Michelet,
by Daniel Halevy . . . Sunday afternoons, her little salon is
thronged with a group of young writers who come, not to wor
ship, but to tell their hopes and their ambitious to this elder
sister of French letters.
Quite young people are there too. How I wish I could pic
ture her to you as she pours out tea to me and my children:
the bird-like poise of, the little head; the waving while hair
conlincd by a coquettish black velvet band; the soft grey satin
ribbon clasped with a pearl around the delicate throat; the
linely embroidered while vest disappearing beneath the folds
which cover the still girlish bust. Yes: perhaps there is still
in all this the trace of the conscious artist, Vivian Hell. Hut
it is not the aesthete, it is the woman taught by love, who
enters so sympathetically into all the small problems of our
lives. She has not even forgotten that American boys like
plumcake. Giving tea and toast to five or six people is at best
a distracting task; but this hostess, whilst holding the richly
carved teapot far too heavy for the little wrist, continues in
silver tones to discuss with easy mastery the varied problems
of art and literature. I see my boy's eyes taking on a far-oil'
expression. Perhaps, alter all, it might be more wonderful to
write a book which would thrill than to be the Cotton King he
had always dreamed to be. Just there is the greatest contribu
tion of Mary Robinson, the poet, and of Madame Duclaux, the
historian and biographer: she is a wonderful inspircr of
youth. She points out the better way. She shows that art
must be the center of life. She ushers into the realm of the
spirit.
Life is gayer in this little salon of the Rue de Varenne than
in the palace of Ihe Champs-Elysees. It is a joy to have seen
this exquisite white lily, so different from the llaming red
one which bled over Therese's heart. Life has its revenge:
where is Therese?
It would be fascinating and often sad to follow through
life the heroes and heroines of romance. Charlotte, for whom
voting Werther wished to commit suicide, arouses no thrill
in Goethe when, as a stout commonplace matron, she appears
before the high court official, the clean of European letters,
the Olympian.
What has become, we ask, of the charming young English
poetess and "aesthete," Vivian Bell, whom Anatole France
pictures rather ironically in Le Lijs Ruiuje? 1 can tell you, for
1 have seen her in the intimate atmosphere of her own home.

affectionate portrait of the poetess.
Vivian Hell, then Mary Robinson, now Madame Duclaux,
although seventy-four years old, cannot be called an old lady.
She is the eternally young woman, still "the girl with the
wonderful eyes."
Life and love have both come by. Therese, you remember,
exclaimed, when silting one evening with Vivian by the cosy
boudoir fire: "Cherie, there is no man in the world exquisite
and 'delicate' enough for you." Hut two very distinguished
savants wooed and won her. The Orientalist, James Dunnes*
letlcr, in far-away India, recognized in the poetess a kindred
spirit. He came to pay homage to the artist, and found a
woman to whom he olTered his love. After only a few years
of life together, death took the great scholar. . . . Quite a
few years later, she married Emilc Duclaux, the scientist, suc
cessor to Pasteur. Perhaps it was through her close associa
tion with these two painstaking men that the author of poems
called A Handful of Honeysuckle acquired those habits of
patient investigation which enabled her to write, not only a
delightful History of France, but to interpret in sympathetic
biographies the lives of several of France's greatest men, Ke
nan, Victor Hugo, Racine, Pascal.
"If some one loves you, and you love him, do what you
believe you must do: but do not mix up with love the interests
and material arrangements that have nothing to do with sen
timent." When she received Ibis piece of advice from Therese,
Vivian Hell blushed deeply: she was shocked. This same girl,
as Madame Duclaux, could relate with delicate sympathy the
lifty-year-long attachment of Victor Hugo and Juliette Drouet.
But it is as a charming woman, not as a writer, I like best
to remember her. Surrounding her in her salon are the sou
venirs of a lifetime, paintings from Florence, bells from Assisi,
portraits of dear and near ones. The light shining through
golden curtains falls on a low table covered with copies of the
latest books dedicated to her, Clinuits, by Maurois, Michelet,
by Daniel Halevy . . . Sunday afternoons, her little salon is
thronged with a group of young writers who come, not to wor
ship, but to tell their hopes and their ambitious to this elder
sister of French letters.
Quite young people are there too. How I wish I could pic
ture her to you as she pours out tea to me and my children:
the bird-like poise of, the little head; the waving while hair
conlincd by a coquettish black velvet band; the soft grey satin
ribbon clasped with a pearl around the delicate throat; the
linely embroidered while vest disappearing beneath the folds
which cover the still girlish bust. Yes: perhaps there is still
in all this the trace of the conscious artist, Vivian Hell. Hut
it is not the aesthete, it is the woman taught by love, who
enters so sympathetically into all the small problems of our
lives. She has not even forgotten that American boys like
plumcake. Giving tea and toast to five or six people is at best
a distracting task; but this hostess, whilst holding the richly
carved teapot far too heavy for the little wrist, continues in
silver tones to discuss with easy mastery the varied problems
of art and literature. I see my boy's eyes taking on a far-oil'
expression. Perhaps, alter all, it might be more wonderful to
write a book which would thrill than to be the Cotton King he
had always dreamed to be. Just there is the greatest contribu
tion of Mary Robinson, the poet, and of Madame Duclaux, the
historian and biographer: she is a wonderful inspircr of
youth. She points out the better way. She shows that art
must be the center of life. She ushers into the realm of the
spirit.
Life is gayer in this little salon of the Rue de Varenne than
in the palace of Ihe Champs-Elysees. It is a joy to have seen
this exquisite white lily, so different from the llaming red
one which bled over Therese's heart. Life has its revenge:
where is Therese?
It would be fascinating and often sad to follow through
life the heroes and heroines of romance. Charlotte, for whom
voting Werther wished to commit suicide, arouses no thrill
in Goethe when, as a stout commonplace matron, she appears
before the high court official, the clean of European letters,
the Olympian.
What has become, we ask, of the charming young English
poetess and "aesthete," Vivian Bell, whom Anatole France
pictures rather ironically in Le Lijs Ruiuje? 1 can tell you, for
1 have seen her in the intimate atmosphere of her own home.
More than forty years have passed since Therese and
Dechartrc, looking out over Florence from the rose-covered
terrace of Vivian Hell's home in Fiesole, felt the pitiless call
of passion. The "red lilies" have blossomed and faded many,
many summers in that exquisite garden in Tuscany. Hut in
May, in Paris, on a window sill overlooking the garden of the
former Convent ties Oiscaux, behind which rises the tarnished
dome of the Invalides, can be seen a pot of the loveliest, most
delicate Lilies of the Valley, and above them, inhaling their
fragrance, bends the delicate head of Vivian Hell. We regret
that the great master is not here to picture her to the world
as she now is, and to atone for the dash of mockery in his
affectionate portrait of the poetess.
