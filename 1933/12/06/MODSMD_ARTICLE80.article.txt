### 
The Snows of Helicon, by H. H. Tomlinson. (Harper and
Brothers.) 1933.
A work of shy disconcerting beauty, luminous through a
triple veil. John Travel's, the hero, is a modern Quixote: an
architect who breaks away from materialistic civilization and
dies a martyr to his dream. In the words of his faithful squire,
his Sancho Bau/.a, Bert Bylcs, the bos'un, he might seem
"potty" and "blotto." Vet, with Byles, the practical man hum
bled in presence of an incomprehensible faith, we dimly ((lies
lion whether it is not our whole business world that is "blotto"
and "potly."
As a running base to tiiis spiritual epic, there is a simpler
drama: the ageing husband, the much younger wife, the Boy.
Would Travers have started on his hopeless crusade if he had
been safely anchored in his private happiness?
The drops back of the stage are masterly iu their elusivc
ncss: as accurate as an engineer's report, shimmering like a
dream: Liverpool, New Vork, South America, the Mediter
ranean. Nothing in Conrad conveys the shudder of tropical
mystery better than the pages on the Paraungual) jungle. The
wreck of the train by the insurgents is described with photo
graphic delinitencss, yet with a touch of strangeness. The
scene comes to us through an observer whose senses and rea
soning powers are unimpaired, but whose soul is perturbed.
Tomlinson is like his hero, and England is like Tomlinson.
Kngland, home of the industrial revolution, has never fully
accepted it. Her t'topia has ever been the green fields or the
seven seas, not the counting house, and least of all the factory.
The protest of Carlyle, Buskin, Morris, Hudson, Chesterton,
Inge, Aldington names quoted almost at random is not the
feeble wail or whine ol a defeated past : it is the assertion of
a soul which the machine has wounded, but not subdued.
