(Inspired by the French of Paul I'ulery)
Thy footsteps, children of my silence,
Slozc ami sacrcil, take their zcay
Toward my bed of vigilance,
Moving mutely, cold as clay.
Thou pure being, shade divine,
Thy chastened footsteps arc so szeect!
.11l the gifts which J divine
Come to nic on those bare feet!
If with lips advanced thou come,
Preparing from thy store of bliss
To nourish the expectant one
With the abundance of a kiss,
Hasten not thine act for me,
Thy fragrance of suspension fleet
Tor I have lived to wait for thee.
My heart was nothing but thy feet.
