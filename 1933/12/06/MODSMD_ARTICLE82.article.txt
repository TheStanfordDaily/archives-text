We wont to a parly at Hear Lake that night. We swam
! in the moonlight and daneed to the inusie of a portable pliono
! graph. Joan was quiet as we drove home along the river road.
! She sat staring out of the ear while her hair blew in the wind.
"What's the matter —got a hcadache?" I asked.
"There's something I've got to talk to you about, Don/' She
| spoke slowly. "It's about you and me. We started going to
i gether about three years ago, didn't we?"
| "Yes," I answered vacantly.
"Well, things are different now—since we graduated from
high school. You are going away to college—there will be
j other girls and I thought—l don't know just how to say it
but —maybe it would be best if we slopped going together now
| instead of waiting until you go away—?" She broke off.
I watched the road and gripped the wheel until mv lingers
! hurl. It was quiet. I had thought of this before but somehow
! it hadn't seemed possible. We had always gone together—it
was so natural. Now it was over and I had to say something.
"I guess you're right, Joan. We're 100 young to take this
j sort of thing seriously." I tried to laugh but my throat was
j dry.
"Puppy love—my folks call it. Dad says 1 ought to forget
it." She was talking fast now and looking the other way.
"I'm going to study law," I said. "It will be years before
j I graduate." I heard myself say Ibis but I was thinking of
I other things. I wanted to tell her it was all wrong. Every
thing was wrong—that we were old enough to take things
seriously. I remembered that night at the beach when I had
first kissed her —tile desert party—graduation night and Hie
senior play. It would be so easy to convince her. We were
sitting close together now and I was afraid to touch her. I
turned corners without seeing them. We slopped in front of
her house.
"I guess I'd better go in," she said. I didn't look at her as
! I opened the door. We walked up the path together and
| stopped at the gate. "Do you think it's the best way, Don?"
she asked.
"Sure," I answered. I watched her white shoes as they
moved up the stairs and disappeared in the darkness.
I sat in my car staring at the big house for several minutes.
I There was a light burning in Joan's room. When the light
I went out I drove away, staring blindly while I thought of what
| had happened. I thought of things I should have said. Why
! hadn't I told her it was all wrong? I had been too proud. We
! were both proud. I had never felt this way before—dull and
j empty. We had always been together—planned together—-
i now everything I thought of seemed useless. Suddenly I was
; tired and sleepy. I drove home and went to bed.
I
n
I went out with several girls during the next two weeks.
They were attractive and I usually had a good time but when
! I got home there was the same dull feeling. I told myself that
, it was foolish—that there Were hundreds of girls just as bcau
i tifill, just as clever—then I went to sleep and dreamt about
; Joan.
I saw her as soon as I walked into Charlie's Saturday night.
She was dancing wilh Clarence. 1 turned quickly and walked
to the counter because I wanted time to think,
They danced by without seeing inc. Joan was laughing.
[ Why did she have to dance with Clarence? I never had liked
; him. He was a good dancer and she followed him perfectly.
I 1 imagined what he was telling her—. Of course it was foolish
Ito be jealous—it was all over between lis. I wanted to hit
I Clarence.
When the music stopped the dancers moved oil' the lloor
i and gathered in little groups on the balcony. I finished mv
I drink and stood for a moment planning what to do. Joe
! winked at me as I paid him and started toward the others,
j He never missed anything. They were standing by the window
| when I found them.
"Hello, Clarence," I said. "Who's your friend?"
"Pardon me," he answered, smiling. "1 thought you had
met."
She thought a minute. "Well, I have the next three," she
| answered. "I suppose after that ."
Just then Ruth walked up. I asked her for the dance and
we walked oil' together. "Sec you later," I said as we started
toward the dance lloor.
I watched her all evening while I danced with other girls.
Twice I caught her looking my way. She turned quickly and
started talking to Clarence.
II was almost dosing lime when I saw my chance. Clar
ence was going to ask Joan for the next dance. I waited until
he had almost reached her before I started in her direction.
When I came ii|> to them he had jusl asked for the dance.
"You're a little late," he said as they walked away. I didn't
say anything jusl stood there looking discouraged for si min-
I ulc and then walked slowly to the front door. I was watching
.loan in the mirror.
I had almost reached my car before I heard (lie sound of
her higli-hceled shoes on the sidewalk. She was running. I
climbed into my car without looking back.
"Don," she s:iid. "I didn't mean to be
"I .el's g<> for a ride," I said.

Twice I caught her looking my way. She turned quickly and
started talking to Clarence.
II was almost dosing lime when I saw my chance. Clar
ence was going to ask Joan for the next dance. I waited until
he had almost reached her before I started in her direction.
When I came ii|> to them he had jusl asked for the dance.
"You're a little late," he said as they walked away. I didn't
say anything jusl stood there looking discouraged for si min-
I ulc and then walked slowly to the front door. I was watching
.loan in the mirror.
I had almost reached my car before I heard (lie sound of
her higli-hceled shoes on the sidewalk. She was running. I
climbed into my car without looking back.
"Don," she s:iid. "I didn't mean to be
"I .el's g<> for a ride," I said.
We wont to a parly at Hear Lake that night. We swam
! in the moonlight and daneed to the inusie of a portable pliono
! graph. Joan was quiet as we drove home along the river road.
! She sat staring out of the ear while her hair blew in the wind.
"What's the matter —got a hcadache?" I asked.
"There's something I've got to talk to you about, Don/' She
| spoke slowly. "It's about you and me. We started going to
i gether about three years ago, didn't we?"
| "Yes," I answered vacantly.
"Well, things are different now—since we graduated from
high school. You are going away to college—there will be
j other girls and I thought—l don't know just how to say it
but —maybe it would be best if we slopped going together now
| instead of waiting until you go away—?" She broke off.
I watched the road and gripped the wheel until mv lingers
! hurl. It was quiet. I had thought of this before but somehow
! it hadn't seemed possible. We had always gone together—it
was so natural. Now it was over and I had to say something.
"I guess you're right, Joan. We're 100 young to take this
j sort of thing seriously." I tried to laugh but my throat was
j dry.
"Puppy love—my folks call it. Dad says 1 ought to forget
it." She was talking fast now and looking the other way.
"I'm going to study law," I said. "It will be years before
j I graduate." I heard myself say Ibis but I was thinking of
I other things. I wanted to tell her it was all wrong. Every
thing was wrong—that we were old enough to take things
seriously. I remembered that night at the beach when I had
first kissed her —tile desert party—graduation night and Hie
senior play. It would be so easy to convince her. We were
sitting close together now and I was afraid to touch her. I
turned corners without seeing them. We slopped in front of
her house.
"I guess I'd better go in," she said. I didn't look at her as
! I opened the door. We walked up the path together and
| stopped at the gate. "Do you think it's the best way, Don?"
she asked.
"Sure," I answered. I watched her white shoes as they
moved up the stairs and disappeared in the darkness.
I sat in my car staring at the big house for several minutes.
I There was a light burning in Joan's room. When the light
I went out I drove away, staring blindly while I thought of what
| had happened. I thought of things I should have said. Why
! hadn't I told her it was all wrong? I had been too proud. We
! were both proud. I had never felt this way before—dull and
j empty. We had always been together—planned together—-
i now everything I thought of seemed useless. Suddenly I was
; tired and sleepy. I drove home and went to bed.
I
n
I went out with several girls during the next two weeks.
They were attractive and I usually had a good time but when
! I got home there was the same dull feeling. I told myself that
, it was foolish—that there Were hundreds of girls just as bcau
i tifill, just as clever—then I went to sleep and dreamt about
; Joan.
I saw her as soon as I walked into Charlie's Saturday night.
She was dancing wilh Clarence. 1 turned quickly and walked
to the counter because I wanted time to think,
They danced by without seeing inc. Joan was laughing.
[ Why did she have to dance with Clarence? I never had liked
; him. He was a good dancer and she followed him perfectly.
I 1 imagined what he was telling her—. Of course it was foolish
Ito be jealous—it was all over between lis. I wanted to hit
I Clarence.
When the music stopped the dancers moved oil' the lloor
i and gathered in little groups on the balcony. I finished mv
I drink and stood for a moment planning what to do. Joe
! winked at me as I paid him and started toward the others,
j He never missed anything. They were standing by the window
| when I found them.
"Hello, Clarence," I said. "Who's your friend?"
"Pardon me," he answered, smiling. "1 thought you had
met."
She thought a minute. "Well, I have the next three," she
| answered. "I suppose after that ."
Just then Ruth walked up. I asked her for the dance and
we walked oil' together. "Sec you later," I said as we started
toward the dance lloor.

I 1 imagined what he was telling her—. Of course it was foolish
Ito be jealous—it was all over between lis. I wanted to hit
I Clarence.
When the music stopped the dancers moved oil' the lloor
i and gathered in little groups on the balcony. I finished mv
I drink and stood for a moment planning what to do. Joe
! winked at me as I paid him and started toward the others,
j He never missed anything. They were standing by the window

"Hello, Clarence," I said. "Who's your friend?"
"Pardon me," he answered, smiling. "1 thought you had
met."
She thought a minute. "Well, I have the next three," she
| answered. "I suppose after that ."
Just then Ruth walked up. I asked her for the dance and
we walked oil' together. "Sec you later," I said as we started
toward the dance lloor.
I watched her all evening while I danced with other girls.
Twice I caught her looking my way. She turned quickly and
started talking to Clarence.
II was almost dosing lime when I saw my chance. Clar
ence was going to ask Joan for the next dance. I waited until
he had almost reached her before I started in her direction.
When I came ii|> to them he had jusl asked for the dance.
"You're a little late," he said as they walked away. I didn't
say anything jusl stood there looking discouraged for si min-
I ulc and then walked slowly to the front door. I was watching
.loan in the mirror.
I had almost reached my car before I heard (lie sound of
her higli-hceled shoes on the sidewalk. She was running. I
climbed into my car without looking back.
"Don," she s:iid. "I didn't mean to be

We wont to a parly at Hear Lake that night. We swam
! in the moonlight and daneed to the inusie of a portable pliono
! graph. Joan was quiet as we drove home along the river road.
! She sat staring out of the ear while her hair blew in the wind.
"What's the matter —got a hcadache?" I asked.
"There's something I've got to talk to you about, Don/' She
| spoke slowly. "It's about you and me. We started going to
i gether about three years ago, didn't we?"
| "Yes," I answered vacantly.
"Well, things are different now—since we graduated from
high school. You are going away to college—there will be
j other girls and I thought—l don't know just how to say it
but —maybe it would be best if we slopped going together now
| instead of waiting until you go away—?" She broke off.
I watched the road and gripped the wheel until mv lingers
! hurl. It was quiet. I had thought of this before but somehow
! it hadn't seemed possible. We had always gone together—it
was so natural. Now it was over and I had to say something.
"I guess you're right, Joan. We're 100 young to take this
j sort of thing seriously." I tried to laugh but my throat was
j dry.
"Puppy love—my folks call it. Dad says 1 ought to forget
it." She was talking fast now and looking the other way.
"I'm going to study law," I said. "It will be years before
j I graduate." I heard myself say Ibis but I was thinking of
I other things. I wanted to tell her it was all wrong. Every
thing was wrong—that we were old enough to take things
seriously. I remembered that night at the beach when I had
first kissed her —tile desert party—graduation night and Hie
senior play. It would be so easy to convince her. We were
sitting close together now and I was afraid to touch her. I
turned corners without seeing them. We slopped in front of
her house.
"I guess I'd better go in," she said. I didn't look at her as
! I opened the door. We walked up the path together and
| stopped at the gate. "Do you think it's the best way, Don?"
she asked.
"Sure," I answered. I watched her white shoes as they
moved up the stairs and disappeared in the darkness.
I sat in my car staring at the big house for several minutes.
I There was a light burning in Joan's room. When the light
I went out I drove away, staring blindly while I thought of what
| had happened. I thought of things I should have said. Why
! hadn't I told her it was all wrong? I had been too proud. We
! were both proud. I had never felt this way before—dull and
j empty. We had always been together—planned together—-
i now everything I thought of seemed useless. Suddenly I was
; tired and sleepy. I drove home and went to bed.

I went out with several girls during the next two weeks.
They were attractive and I usually had a good time but when

, it was foolish—that there Were hundreds of girls just as bcau
i tifill, just as clever—then I went to sleep and dreamt about
