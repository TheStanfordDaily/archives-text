# THE 						HOPE THAT MUST FAIL

### GARET RICHARDS 
Americans in general and my Uncle Henry in particular
I are always linding self-salisl'ying justifications for things,
i Thus, America went into the War —not because we found our
| selves in it—but rather "to make the world safe for denioc
; racy." Uncle Henry subscribes to that slogan with vehemence
though, when pressed, he admits that he voted for Hughes in
191(). Uncle Henry was lirni in believing that 1929 prosperity
was sounding the death-knell for national poverty and an ex
ample to foreigners as well. Hut in 1933, Uncle is just as cer
tain that the depression is the greatest thing for the re-estab
lishment of saner values for the people generally. If asked
about education, lienry thinks it is the greatest thing for
democracy; and believes of course that higher education trains
the leaders of tomorrow.
That last pious belief is not a personal idea with my Uncle.
It is repeated at every college commencement; and at about
70 per cent of the high 'school graduations. So long has this
song been repeated, that we all know the words by heart. And
anything we know by heart we believe, for the simple reason
that it is so hard to unlearn something and then learn soine
! tiling new to lill its place.
Higher education stands in a unique position today. It is
j practically the only institution that does not have a society
! seeking its abolition. A few daring souls suggest that it be
modified. But none suggest that it be eliminated or curtailed.
College trains leaders. Democracy needs leaders. Any fresh
man logic student can complete the syllogism. And every
Fourth of July orator can scream that education is the founda
tion of democratic government.
Pious Republicans in the Far West point with conviction
at the uneducated Tammany district leaders as final proof
that lack of college training breeds corruption and bad gov
ernment generally. It is so clear to a Western Republican that
Tammany is not only the raison d'etre of governmental cor
ruption in New York but is as well the chief inspircr of cor
rupt government everywhere. They forget Hoisc Penrose, Har
vard honor student, and his Pennsylvania organization. And
still further West is Abe Ruef who milked San Francisco
without the aid of a vast permanent organization. Ruef is a
University of California graduate; and a brilliant student in
his time.
They also forget that the most flagrant and notorious case
of corruption in the last decade was engineered by college
men. Henry Micajah Daugherty and Edwin Dcnby are both
University of Michigan boys who made good at Washington.
Of course it'must be admitted that Albert Fall who "took the
rap" did not have a university diploma. Which must prove
something—probably, go to college and slay out of jail. Also,
Warren Gamaliel Harding, who is still hovering between re
spectability and political harlotry, was a college man.
Rut examples of political corruption can be found among
those who go to college and among those who missed that op
portunity—which proves nothing at all; but clearly refutes
the contention that if somehow every office-holder were im
mersed into the waters of learning, he would come up sput
tering honesty and public service.
After all, integrity is something picked up at your mother's
knee and so college cannot be blamed for the shortcomings of
the mother's knee. Rut intelligent leadership, that we can
surely find in college-trained men. Rut then there is ex-Sena
tor "Tom-Tom" Hellin, who, if he did not originate, probably
believed, the "Sub - Mediterranean, Trans - Atlantic Tunnel"
from the Vatican to Washington D.C. plan when and if the
1928 Rrown Derby were hung on the Capitol Dome. No, Hellin
isn't a "fireside self-larncd" boy from the wilds. He is a col
lege product. And those who may sigh with gratification that
the "voters finally turned him out" are stopped by that other
college-bred monstrosity, the Honorable Hucy P. Long. Yes,
this thinly veiled excuse for a statesman attended two uni
versities.
And those who detect a Republican predilection in these
two examples, may turn to Thomas K. Watson, till quite re
cently a Senator from Indiana. Up until the time he was de
feated, he was repeating his tariff" speech held over from the
nineteenth century. Rut after all, Watson only attended Mer
cer College for two years. That may explain him away. Rut
Iwo-ycar attendance cannot account for Simeon I). Fess—a
graduate of Ohio Northern. Fess was not only a Senator but
he was a majority leader. Those who look to college for in
telligent leadership cannot help but squint with horror when
they see Fess looming over the educational horizon.

Yet these are only individual cases. That is obvious. They
can be matched by brilliant statesmen whom the universities
claim to have produced because these men may have spent
four years within the walls. It is by universal college educa
tion, however, that they claim the citizenry is to be elevated;
not by a rare star every now and then.
In 1890, there were only 68,000 college students. Rut to
day, there are about one million. The tidal wave of education
is every day drenching more and more. You can hardly turn
around nowadays without bumping into a college president.
Graduates can be found almost anywhere—including places
you never would expect to find them such as bread lines, gaso
line stations, and labor gangs.
In 190"), just one year after the voters had repudiated the
Democratic sacrificial lamb for the virulent Teddy Roosevelt,
there were 2 1 /2 college graduates for every 1,000 persons. It
was obvious how little the college graduates could do to better
the weave of the political fabric at that time. Rut now, when
we count noses, we will find 23 educated ones in every 1,000.
That is almost ten limes as many as there were in 1905.
II college trains leaders for our democracy, and that is
always assumed, we ponder to query, "What are they doing?"
Of course, we can always ask when is a leader a leader? A
man who dictates to his wife how she will vote is a leader of
two voles —his and his wife's. Rut that is small-time leader
ship indeed. We must expect greater things from our gradu
ates. II each of these college graduates were only to lead (on
an average) 45 persons, the entire population would be college
led, which according to many is the next best thing to being
college-bred.
But with all lliis reputed leadership, can we say that gov
ernment is any heller today than it was in 1900? Then, if this
question is answered in the affirmative, we must next ask is
our present governmental set-up ten times better? And though
this too were to receive our nod, we would still have to prove
that the improvement is due to the graduates. The proof of
either affirmation is not only tremendous; it is impossible,
i Some cynics even go so far as to say that conditions are get
ting worse and worse not better. And even the more level
, headed optimists admit that practically the only material
( improvements in tlie last two decades have been structural
1 rather than functional. That is: we have developed a direct
i primary, ;m Australian ballot, a budget, and many other gov
ernmental gadgets. Rut the machine still sputters along leak
i ing as much as ever.

Now, education is a very noble tiling and also very nebu
lous. It produces a most convenient cure-all lor all our gov
ernmental ills. Educate the citizenry, and Hie citi/enrv shall
liberate themselves from corruption. Education alone distin
guishes man from the savage. The logic is hoary with age and
almost indelible by constant repetition. The more acres we
cover with manure, the more we produce. The same concep
tion is applied to the nation. The more people we educate, the
more good citizens we produce. The parallel is not parallel
at its inception. You can manure the Sahara wastes for years,
but you can't grow sweet-peas there. Education (college edu
cation) on most people is like manure on the Sahara—impo
tent. Further, while we know that nitrogen from the manure
will aid growing sweet-pea plants, we only assume by un
substantiated theory that college education will produce bel
ter citizens even among those who are physically capable of
absorbing it.

Listening to the average educator at a commencement, you
might imagine that every college graduate is straining at the
college ties to dash oil' and be a "good" citizen. You might
imagine thai he is brimming over with vital "facts" about
"his" government. You might imagine that he is just dizzy
with anxiety to be oil' on a reforming spree to remove the
"bosses," etc. If you have ever imagined such things, it must
be made perfectly clear that you have only imagined them.
But it just isn't the writer's word against that of the coiu
inencement orator. In their local student-body government,
the collegians show themselves even more apathetic and unin
formed than the citizenry as a whole. This, despite the fact
that everything is taking place right beneath their noses. Then
too, the candidates know the students more intimately than
any other type of office-seeker, although it is said that Borah
(in his younger days) could call 50 per cent of the citizens and
25 per cent of the sheep in Idaho by their lirst name. If a
student is too uninterested to walk across the campus to vote,
where do they get the idea that the college student is socially
minded?
And are campus elections conducted on the high plane to
which college graduates are supposed to elevate government,
once they become of age? They are not only just as ignorantly
pitched, but their odor is as fetid. True they do not speak of
a tariff" which will protect the local market and yet maintain
foreign trade at the same time. But many is the campus can
didate who pledges drastic economy in his expenditures if
elected yet without any curtailment of campus activities. And
the number who get elected without pledging anything is ap
palling. Yet few students object. Campus platforms contain
the inanities that have long made the national platforms such
parlor jokes. The similarity of attitude is startling.
And as to shady tricks—some of the regulars might pick
up some tips at any major campus. Of course, there is no
actual gangsterism. No one is actually shot. Sometimes, how
ever, a campaign manager is kidnapped. Or a candidate will
hide himself, and his supporters will maintain that the oppo
sition has kidnapped him. Ballot boxes are stuffed. Caucuses
arc packed. Sounds like Philadelphia or New York.
Then, there was the time when the Doe faction conspicu
ously marked 100 ballots for Hoe and stuffed them into the
box, expecting the pseudo-fraud to be detected and blamed on
Roe. They were not disappointed. Then once, Catholic .Jones
spread the rumor that Protestant Brown was persecuting him
because of his religion—which was untrue. Jones captured
the Catholics solid and enough fair-minded Protestants who
objected to the "persecution" to win the election without much
difficulty.
College students are not more corrupt than adults; but they
are not much better! To expect that from college we will get
a race of leaders immune to graft is preposterous. True, col
lege students are more careful about indulging in graft; but
why? Not because they object to il on ethical grounds. Rather
they fear college presidents who mete out sure and speedy
"justice" (or at least punishment) without benefit of legal
technicalities or shyster lawyers.
Of course, it is impossible to deny thai education does
impart facts to the student. In grammar school, he learns that
2 X -= 4. In high school, he learns that the square root of
4 is 2. And in college, he learns the historical, philosophical,
and psychological basis of numbers. But thai does not breed
a mass of leaders dedicated to lead lite people to higher things
in government.
