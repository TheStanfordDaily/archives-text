# VOLUME ONE

### A. GROVE DAY 
I

They s;iy I lie human body changes and renews itsell in all
ils ]>:irts every seven years. 11' that he true, a {{roup ol Stan
lord alumni now scattered over these t'nited States are no
longer the men they were when, in the autumn ol 192"), thev
husilv confabulated upon an exciting endeavor. They were
occupied in the most heart-stirring task known to civilized
humanity. They were getting out Volume One, Number One
of a new magazine a monthly literary and critical review
casually criticized the Stanford J.it.
They were a light-hearted bunch, not particularly im
pressed by the inomentousness of the occasion. Quaintly
enough, the first editorial commenced with an epitaph:
"Of all our literarg .scenes
Saddest this sight to me:
The graves of little magazines
That died to make verse free."
The Press Building in which these cheery fellows had their
editorial cubbyhole was redolent with a musty smell partly
emanating, they knew, from the embalmed corpses ol other
Stanford magazines the lamented Sequoia, the late Cardinal,
the departed Pictorial, and the Spectator, deceased- —and they
must have suspected that these victims of malnutrition and
premature senility had been sent out into the world by their
eager creators with no less faith and enthusiasm than their
successors were now lavishing on Volume One, Number One.
They didn't worry about it. They were having fun.
This was the nearest they came to a nianil'esto: "If our
verses were published in limp leather editions by Brentano,
our essays by Mr. Knopf, and our stories by K. P. Dutton, we
would not be writing for a college magazine," ran the words
of Editor Everett R. Smith. "If your taste demanded the
lu logncs of Virgil, the Critique of Pure Reason, or the stories
of Joseph Conrad, you would not be reading a college maga
zine."

II

So they went ahead, there jovial undergraduates, drinking
bad beer and writing good prose, and month after month pub
lishing that prose along with the writings of any friends, ac
quaintances, or enemies who could be pushed into a corner
and cajoled or threatened into promising something good for
the next issue.
Not that there was ever any lack of manuscripts in the
cubbyhole. The rickety table was usually slacked with essays
(plainly corrected in red ink in the hand of the English 137
instructor), and stories beginning either: "It is a far cry from
Piccadilly Circus to the island of Bogo-bogo in the Seas of the
South, but Langdon Winchelsea . . ~" or else: "Across the
street at the Sigma Sigma house, someone was rattling out the
tinny chorus of Who's lloney-Mama Arc You? Evelyn Up
pingham sighed, leaned on the window-sill, and stared at the
bullions moon." Perhaps with a rare dash of originality, the
story would begin: "It is a tale told in old Yarnec, how on a
night of storm Udric, called The Towheaded, passed into the
dubious Wood of El very and thus, in the arms of a witch
woman, came like all others before him to bis allotted doom"
- for in those days the involuted quiddities of King .lames
were absolute law. Few of the stories that came in lacked a
dead person somewhere; at least one corpse, perhaps more,
was the rule. This was not, 1 imagine, because the mind of the
undergraduate writer was morbidly preoccupied with fore
bodings of mortality: but merely that any less figure than
hell's grim tyrant was trivial and unworthy of the talents to
be expended. And a good murder, suicide, or fatal mishap
could always be depended upon to run very nicely to a couple
thousand words or so.
Oh, yes—we were always specifically warned that if we
dared to wield our blue pencil even upon a comma, well—!
And poetry! It is to those impressionable days that I trace
the beginnings of the phobia that causes a scream to well in
niv throat whenever my eye falls upon anything printed in
stanzas instead of paragraphs. The lloor of the cubbyhole was
always knee-deep in a rubble of imperishable (though un
published) verse. You could not push your way in without
stubbing your toe on a sonnet-cycle to somebody, or get to the
desk without barking your shin on the first canto of a modern
epic. Then, about that time, the word somehow got around
that Rhyme and Rhythm had made their last stand, and there
after we were deluged with little things dashed oil' in odd
moments, usually in purple ink on cream-colored notepapcr.
People you would never suspect of lyricism would just sit
down and tell the world exactly how they fell; and if they
were careful about breaking up the lines at the right places
and scattering Three Dots here and there throughout, the re
sult was ;it a distance practically indistinguishable from some
thing by Maxwell Rodcnhcim or e. e. cuminings. . . . We did
print some of this liberated verse, but it invariably led to
arguments with linolvpcrs.

III

There were fretful (lays and days of hustle, and evenings
of jul>il;ition, and nights with a typewriter or proof-sheets, and
somehow eaeh successive issue came out almost on time. And
the upshot wasn't had at all. Thumbing mv bound copy of
Volume One, I find nothing therein that is absolutely blush
ful; and when I happen upon a story by Margaret Olsen or
Hud Spencer, or an article on jazz by Herb Klein, or one of
Toby Street's plays, why, then I recapture the old thrill of the
literary Columbus that each of us is at heart, and mutter:
"Good damn good!"
Ves, it was good fun, Volume One. And all of us, I think,
were :is surprised as pleased to discover at the end of spring
term that the Lit had won the interest and respect of faculty
and students, had grown to a 48-page affair with frontispiece
and decorations, had published the work of no less than sixty
four campus contributors, had through the almost fiendish
skill of its business manager filled the coffers with enough
moneys to see it through another year of bills and expenses—
had, in short, become a Stanford "tradition." Few us grieved
when, the following autumn, the magazine dolled its cordu
roys and became a dignified something called the Stanford
Literal'!/ Magazine; just as few of us were startled when, in
19.'10, the Stanford Literal'!/ Magazine stumbled into the old
pit and became at one with Sequoia, ('.ordinal, and the rest,
leaving no periodical on the campus whose pleasure it was to
encourage student writing and to present the fruits to a not
unappreciative group of student readers. We felt, I think,
that sooner or later, when the time came, a bunch of not-too
solenin undergraduates would get together in the old way,
pull out pencils and odd envelopes, and embark once more
en that delectable task of getting out Volume One, Number
()nc.
Ves, I suspect that those chaps who departed from their
editorial cubbyhole seven years ago still retain unchanged
some of the wisdom that may he found in the yellowing pages
of Volume One. They would know, those fellows, how to
phrase a salute to the new-born Stanford Criteria. For they
knew that a college campus always has the literary magazine
I hat it deserves and sometimes a belter one.

could always be depended upon to run very nicely to a couple

Oh, yes—we were always specifically warned that if we
dared to wield our blue pencil even upon a comma, well—!
And poetry! It is to those impressionable days that I trace
the beginnings of the phobia that causes a scream to well in
niv throat whenever my eye falls upon anything printed in
stanzas instead of paragraphs. The lloor of the cubbyhole was
always knee-deep in a rubble of imperishable (though un
published) verse. You could not push your way in without
stubbing your toe on a sonnet-cycle to somebody, or get to the
desk without barking your shin on the first canto of a modern
epic. Then, about that time, the word somehow got around
that Rhyme and Rhythm had made their last stand, and there
after we were deluged with little things dashed oil' in odd
moments, usually in purple ink on cream-colored notepapcr.
People you would never suspect of lyricism would just sit

thing by Maxwell Rodcnhcim or e. e. cuminings. . . . We did
print some of this liberated verse, but it invariably led to
arguments with linolvpcrs.

There were fretful (lays and days of hustle, and evenings
of jul>il;ition, and nights with a typewriter or proof-sheets, and
somehow eaeh successive issue came out almost on time. And
the upshot wasn't had at all. Thumbing mv bound copy of
Volume One, I find nothing therein that is absolutely blush
ful; and when I happen upon a story by Margaret Olsen or
Hud Spencer, or an article on jazz by Herb Klein, or one of
Toby Street's plays, why, then I recapture the old thrill of the
literary Columbus that each of us is at heart, and mutter:
"Good damn good!"
Ves, it was good fun, Volume One. And all of us, I think,
were :is surprised as pleased to discover at the end of spring
term that the Lit had won the interest and respect of faculty
and students, had grown to a 48-page affair with frontispiece
and decorations, had published the work of no less than sixty
four campus contributors, had through the almost fiendish
skill of its business manager filled the coffers with enough
moneys to see it through another year of bills and expenses—
had, in short, become a Stanford "tradition." Few us grieved
when, the following autumn, the magazine dolled its cordu
roys and became a dignified something called the Stanford
Literal'!/ Magazine; just as few of us were startled when, in
19.'10, the Stanford Literal'!/ Magazine stumbled into the old
pit and became at one with Sequoia, ('.ordinal, and the rest,
leaving no periodical on the campus whose pleasure it was to
encourage student writing and to present the fruits to a not
unappreciative group of student readers. We felt, I think,
that sooner or later, when the time came, a bunch of not-too
solenin undergraduates would get together in the old way,
pull out pencils and odd envelopes, and embark once more
en that delectable task of getting out Volume One, Number
()nc.
Ves, I suspect that those chaps who departed from their
editorial cubbyhole seven years ago still retain unchanged
some of the wisdom that may he found in the yellowing pages
of Volume One. They would know, those fellows, how to
phrase a salute to the new-born Stanford Criteria. For they
knew that a college campus always has the literary magazine
I hat it deserves and sometimes a belter one.
I

They s;iy I lie human body changes and renews itsell in all
ils ]>:irts every seven years. 11' that he true, a {{roup ol Stan
lord alumni now scattered over these t'nited States are no
longer the men they were when, in the autumn ol 192"), thev
husilv confabulated upon an exciting endeavor. They were
occupied in the most heart-stirring task known to civilized
humanity. They were getting out Volume One, Number One
of a new magazine a monthly literary and critical review
casually criticized the Stanford J.it.
They were a light-hearted bunch, not particularly im
pressed by the inomentousness of the occasion. Quaintly
enough, the first editorial commenced with an epitaph:
"Of all our literarg .scenes
Saddest this sight to me:
The graves of little magazines
That died to make verse free."
The Press Building in which these cheery fellows had their
editorial cubbyhole was redolent with a musty smell partly
emanating, they knew, from the embalmed corpses ol other
Stanford magazines the lamented Sequoia, the late Cardinal,
the departed Pictorial, and the Spectator, deceased- —and they
must have suspected that these victims of malnutrition and
premature senility had been sent out into the world by their
eager creators with no less faith and enthusiasm than their
successors were now lavishing on Volume One, Number One.
They didn't worry about it. They were having fun.
This was the nearest they came to a nianil'esto: "If our
verses were published in limp leather editions by Brentano,
our essays by Mr. Knopf, and our stories by K. P. Dutton, we
would not be writing for a college magazine," ran the words
of Editor Everett R. Smith. "If your taste demanded the
lu logncs of Virgil, the Critique of Pure Reason, or the stories
of Joseph Conrad, you would not be reading a college maga
zine."

II

So they went ahead, there jovial undergraduates, drinking
bad beer and writing good prose, and month after month pub
lishing that prose along with the writings of any friends, ac
quaintances, or enemies who could be pushed into a corner
and cajoled or threatened into promising something good for
the next issue.
Not that there was ever any lack of manuscripts in the
cubbyhole. The rickety table was usually slacked with essays
(plainly corrected in red ink in the hand of the English 137
instructor), and stories beginning either: "It is a far cry from
Piccadilly Circus to the island of Bogo-bogo in the Seas of the
South, but Langdon Winchelsea . . ~" or else: "Across the
street at the Sigma Sigma house, someone was rattling out the
tinny chorus of Who's lloney-Mama Arc You? Evelyn Up
pingham sighed, leaned on the window-sill, and stared at the
bullions moon." Perhaps with a rare dash of originality, the
story would begin: "It is a tale told in old Yarnec, how on a
night of storm Udric, called The Towheaded, passed into the
dubious Wood of El very and thus, in the arms of a witch
woman, came like all others before him to bis allotted doom"
- for in those days the involuted quiddities of King .lames
were absolute law. Few of the stories that came in lacked a
dead person somewhere; at least one corpse, perhaps more,
was the rule. This was not, 1 imagine, because the mind of the
undergraduate writer was morbidly preoccupied with fore
bodings of mortality: but merely that any less figure than
hell's grim tyrant was trivial and unworthy of the talents to
be expended. And a good murder, suicide, or fatal mishap
could always be depended upon to run very nicely to a couple
thousand words or so.

knew that a college campus always has the literary magazine
I hat it deserves and sometimes a belter one.

They s;iy I lie human body changes and renews itsell in all
ils ]>:irts every seven years. 11' that he true, a {{roup ol Stan
lord alumni now scattered over these t'nited States are no
longer the men they were when, in the autumn ol 192"), thev
husilv confabulated upon an exciting endeavor. They were
occupied in the most heart-stirring task known to civilized
humanity. They were getting out Volume One, Number One
of a new magazine a monthly literary and critical review
casually criticized the Stanford J.it.
They were a light-hearted bunch, not particularly im
pressed by the inomentousness of the occasion. Quaintly
enough, the first editorial commenced with an epitaph:
"Of all our literarg .scenes
Saddest this sight to me:
The graves of little magazines
That died to make verse free."
The Press Building in which these cheery fellows had their
editorial cubbyhole was redolent with a musty smell partly
emanating, they knew, from the embalmed corpses ol other
Stanford magazines the lamented Sequoia, the late Cardinal,
the departed Pictorial, and the Spectator, deceased- —and they
must have suspected that these victims of malnutrition and
premature senility had been sent out into the world by their
eager creators with no less faith and enthusiasm than their
successors were now lavishing on Volume One, Number One.
They didn't worry about it. They were having fun.
This was the nearest they came to a nianil'esto: "If our
verses were published in limp leather editions by Brentano,
our essays by Mr. Knopf, and our stories by K. P. Dutton, we
would not be writing for a college magazine," ran the words
of Editor Everett R. Smith. "If your taste demanded the
lu logncs of Virgil, the Critique of Pure Reason, or the stories
of Joseph Conrad, you would not be reading a college maga
zine."

II

So they went ahead, there jovial undergraduates, drinking
bad beer and writing good prose, and month after month pub
lishing that prose along with the writings of any friends, ac
quaintances, or enemies who could be pushed into a corner
and cajoled or threatened into promising something good for
the next issue.
Not that there was ever any lack of manuscripts in the
cubbyhole. The rickety table was usually slacked with essays
(plainly corrected in red ink in the hand of the English 137
instructor), and stories beginning either: "It is a far cry from
Piccadilly Circus to the island of Bogo-bogo in the Seas of the
South, but Langdon Winchelsea . . ~" or else: "Across the
street at the Sigma Sigma house, someone was rattling out the
tinny chorus of Who's lloney-Mama Arc You? Evelyn Up
pingham sighed, leaned on the window-sill, and stared at the
bullions moon." Perhaps with a rare dash of originality, the
story would begin: "It is a tale told in old Yarnec, how on a
night of storm Udric, called The Towheaded, passed into the
dubious Wood of El very and thus, in the arms of a witch
woman, came like all others before him to bis allotted doom"
- for in those days the involuted quiddities of King .lames
were absolute law. Few of the stories that came in lacked a
dead person somewhere; at least one corpse, perhaps more,
was the rule. This was not, 1 imagine, because the mind of the
undergraduate writer was morbidly preoccupied with fore
bodings of mortality: but merely that any less figure than
hell's grim tyrant was trivial and unworthy of the talents to
be expended. And a good murder, suicide, or fatal mishap
could always be depended upon to run very nicely to a couple
thousand words or so.
Oh, yes—we were always specifically warned that if we
dared to wield our blue pencil even upon a comma, well—!
And poetry! It is to those impressionable days that I trace
the beginnings of the phobia that causes a scream to well in
niv throat whenever my eye falls upon anything printed in
stanzas instead of paragraphs. The lloor of the cubbyhole was
always knee-deep in a rubble of imperishable (though un
published) verse. You could not push your way in without
stubbing your toe on a sonnet-cycle to somebody, or get to the
desk without barking your shin on the first canto of a modern
epic. Then, about that time, the word somehow got around
that Rhyme and Rhythm had made their last stand, and there
after we were deluged with little things dashed oil' in odd
moments, usually in purple ink on cream-colored notepapcr.
People you would never suspect of lyricism would just sit
down and tell the world exactly how they fell; and if they
were careful about breaking up the lines at the right places
and scattering Three Dots here and there throughout, the re
sult was ;it a distance practically indistinguishable from some
thing by Maxwell Rodcnhcim or e. e. cuminings. . . . We did
print some of this liberated verse, but it invariably led to
arguments with linolvpcrs.

III

There were fretful (lays and days of hustle, and evenings
of jul>il;ition, and nights with a typewriter or proof-sheets, and
somehow eaeh successive issue came out almost on time. And
the upshot wasn't had at all. Thumbing mv bound copy of
Volume One, I find nothing therein that is absolutely blush
ful; and when I happen upon a story by Margaret Olsen or
Hud Spencer, or an article on jazz by Herb Klein, or one of
Toby Street's plays, why, then I recapture the old thrill of the
literary Columbus that each of us is at heart, and mutter:
"Good damn good!"
Ves, it was good fun, Volume One. And all of us, I think,
were :is surprised as pleased to discover at the end of spring
term that the Lit had won the interest and respect of faculty
and students, had grown to a 48-page affair with frontispiece
and decorations, had published the work of no less than sixty
four campus contributors, had through the almost fiendish
skill of its business manager filled the coffers with enough
moneys to see it through another year of bills and expenses—
had, in short, become a Stanford "tradition." Few us grieved
when, the following autumn, the magazine dolled its cordu
roys and became a dignified something called the Stanford
Literal'!/ Magazine; just as few of us were startled when, in
19.'10, the Stanford Literal'!/ Magazine stumbled into the old
pit and became at one with Sequoia, ('.ordinal, and the rest,
leaving no periodical on the campus whose pleasure it was to
encourage student writing and to present the fruits to a not
unappreciative group of student readers. We felt, I think,
that sooner or later, when the time came, a bunch of not-too
solenin undergraduates would get together in the old way,
pull out pencils and odd envelopes, and embark once more
en that delectable task of getting out Volume One, Number
()nc.
Ves, I suspect that those chaps who departed from their
editorial cubbyhole seven years ago still retain unchanged
some of the wisdom that may he found in the yellowing pages
of Volume One. They would know, those fellows, how to

hell's grim tyrant was trivial and unworthy of the talents to

could always be depended upon to run very nicely to a couple
thousand words or so.
Oh, yes—we were always specifically warned that if we
dared to wield our blue pencil even upon a comma, well—!
And poetry! It is to those impressionable days that I trace
the beginnings of the phobia that causes a scream to well in

stanzas instead of paragraphs. The lloor of the cubbyhole was
always knee-deep in a rubble of imperishable (though un
published) verse. You could not push your way in without
stubbing your toe on a sonnet-cycle to somebody, or get to the
desk without barking your shin on the first canto of a modern
epic. Then, about that time, the word somehow got around
that Rhyme and Rhythm had made their last stand, and there
after we were deluged with little things dashed oil' in odd
moments, usually in purple ink on cream-colored notepapcr.
People you would never suspect of lyricism would just sit

thing by Maxwell Rodcnhcim or e. e. cuminings. . . . We did
print some of this liberated verse, but it invariably led to
arguments with linolvpcrs.

There were fretful (lays and days of hustle, and evenings

somehow eaeh successive issue came out almost on time. And
the upshot wasn't had at all. Thumbing mv bound copy of
Volume One, I find nothing therein that is absolutely blush
ful; and when I happen upon a story by Margaret Olsen or
Hud Spencer, or an article on jazz by Herb Klein, or one of
Toby Street's plays, why, then I recapture the old thrill of the
literary Columbus that each of us is at heart, and mutter:
"Good damn good!"
Ves, it was good fun, Volume One. And all of us, I think,
were :is surprised as pleased to discover at the end of spring
term that the Lit had won the interest and respect of faculty
and students, had grown to a 48-page affair with frontispiece
and decorations, had published the work of no less than sixty
four campus contributors, had through the almost fiendish
skill of its business manager filled the coffers with enough
moneys to see it through another year of bills and expenses—
had, in short, become a Stanford "tradition." Few us grieved
when, the following autumn, the magazine dolled its cordu
roys and became a dignified something called the Stanford
Literal'!/ Magazine; just as few of us were startled when, in
19.'10, the Stanford Literal'!/ Magazine stumbled into the old
pit and became at one with Sequoia, ('.ordinal, and the rest,
leaving no periodical on the campus whose pleasure it was to
encourage student writing and to present the fruits to a not
unappreciative group of student readers. We felt, I think,
that sooner or later, when the time came, a bunch of not-too
solenin undergraduates would get together in the old way,
pull out pencils and odd envelopes, and embark once more
en that delectable task of getting out Volume One, Number
()nc.
Ves, I suspect that those chaps who departed from their
editorial cubbyhole seven years ago still retain unchanged
some of the wisdom that may he found in the yellowing pages
of Volume One. They would know, those fellows, how to
phrase a salute to the new-born Stanford Criteria. For they
knew that a college campus always has the literary magazine
I hat it deserves and sometimes a belter one.

They s;iy I lie human body changes and renews itsell in all
ils ]>:irts every seven years. 11' that he true, a {{roup ol Stan
lord alumni now scattered over these t'nited States are no
longer the men they were when, in the autumn ol 192"), thev
husilv confabulated upon an exciting endeavor. They were
occupied in the most heart-stirring task known to civilized
humanity. They were getting out Volume One, Number One
of a new magazine a monthly literary and critical review
casually criticized the Stanford J.it.
They were a light-hearted bunch, not particularly im
pressed by the inomentousness of the occasion. Quaintly
enough, the first editorial commenced with an epitaph:
"Of all our literarg .scenes
Saddest this sight to me:
The graves of little magazines
That died to make verse free."
The Press Building in which these cheery fellows had their
editorial cubbyhole was redolent with a musty smell partly
emanating, they knew, from the embalmed corpses ol other
Stanford magazines the lamented Sequoia, the late Cardinal,
the departed Pictorial, and the Spectator, deceased- —and they
must have suspected that these victims of malnutrition and
premature senility had been sent out into the world by their
eager creators with no less faith and enthusiasm than their
successors were now lavishing on Volume One, Number One.
They didn't worry about it. They were having fun.
This was the nearest they came to a nianil'esto: "If our
verses were published in limp leather editions by Brentano,
our essays by Mr. Knopf, and our stories by K. P. Dutton, we
would not be writing for a college magazine," ran the words
of Editor Everett R. Smith. "If your taste demanded the
lu logncs of Virgil, the Critique of Pure Reason, or the stories
of Joseph Conrad, you would not be reading a college maga
zine."

So they went ahead, there jovial undergraduates, drinking
bad beer and writing good prose, and month after month pub
lishing that prose along with the writings of any friends, ac
quaintances, or enemies who could be pushed into a corner
and cajoled or threatened into promising something good for
the next issue.
Not that there was ever any lack of manuscripts in the
cubbyhole. The rickety table was usually slacked with essays
(plainly corrected in red ink in the hand of the English 137
instructor), and stories beginning either: "It is a far cry from
Piccadilly Circus to the island of Bogo-bogo in the Seas of the
South, but Langdon Winchelsea . . ~" or else: "Across the
street at the Sigma Sigma house, someone was rattling out the
tinny chorus of Who's lloney-Mama Arc You? Evelyn Up
pingham sighed, leaned on the window-sill, and stared at the
bullions moon." Perhaps with a rare dash of originality, the
story would begin: "It is a tale told in old Yarnec, how on a
night of storm Udric, called The Towheaded, passed into the
dubious Wood of El very and thus, in the arms of a witch
woman, came like all others before him to bis allotted doom"
- for in those days the involuted quiddities of King .lames
were absolute law. Few of the stories that came in lacked a
dead person somewhere; at least one corpse, perhaps more,
was the rule. This was not, 1 imagine, because the mind of the
undergraduate writer was morbidly preoccupied with fore
bodings of mortality: but merely that any less figure than
hell's grim tyrant was trivial and unworthy of the talents to
be expended. And a good murder, suicide, or fatal mishap
could always be depended upon to run very nicely to a couple
thousand words or so.
