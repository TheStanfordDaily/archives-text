# FOUR STANFORD POETS
## "FATAL INTERVIEW" 
### 
While drowsy bees sought out the daisies' bed.
Two breezes vied in laughing raee to hear
Aloft a leaf descending unaware;
The sun was pasturing truant clouds o'er head,
flcnignly on the trudging world he spread
His golden smile with absent kindly care;
/u moonlit notes upon the tranquil air
. I thrush with too-full heart her glory shed.
Jilit all at once all nature grew too still;
I felt an icy presence passing nigh,
J lid as it passed with fingers burning chill
It touched my brow and with no mortal eye
Looked deep within my soul until
/ felt its power; and then it passed mc by.
