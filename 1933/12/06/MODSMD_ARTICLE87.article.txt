# TWO POEMS

The Fourth Crow
Trinity winged of raven
faded in azure time,
Wisdom with Solomon's even,
(iarbed a funereal mime,
Stepped mossed rock greenly grave,
Cawing a querulous cry,
Querying the sea and the sky,
Querying the sullen wave.
Query
That day you lost the world, a furtive pebble
Illusive to the strongest clutch, that slipped
So swiftly from your fragile fingers do-wn
Tinkling in the well of blue eternity.
Knew you then the answer/ Heard you then
The laughter? Found you then a home?
