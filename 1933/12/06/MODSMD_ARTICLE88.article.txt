# WHETHER YOU LIKE OR NOT

### 
Does it offend you if a nuui be frank
. kin! fulsome in protesting of his love.'
Or would you ml her flint his speech be blank
Of tenderness, in seeking you to more.'
11 hoi favor finds a facile, mocking tongue
Twist lips you know ore all at hirst for yours/
Docs that, or honeyed passion, raptly sunt/
To melting music best beguile your hours/
Likely the last, you'll say, to ripe romance
(iranlini/ the gage, above a love that mocks;
)'ct, knowing you, I'll lake a mocker's chanceâ€”
j Wit knows no age, whilst romance wears with clocks.
