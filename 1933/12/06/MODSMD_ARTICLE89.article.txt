Alone beside his bronze this ancient man.
Ilead bowed, submissive to the sledge of time,
Broods on while sullen age with frosty rime
Turns raven hair to silver, and the span
Of life thai once auspiciously began
With golden dreams thai youth may but define
(iives warning and a sure, relentless sign
Of parting from the fragile house of man.
The dreamer lifts his head to see the glow
Of winged Hermes, dad for instant flight.
The weary sloop of workman with his hoe.
The discus-thrower bending all his might
Jitcrnally. lie rises to his part
In unremitting toil thai fashions art.
