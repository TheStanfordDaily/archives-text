### KING GALBRAITH 
She was a tall, thin woman with an equine face and star
tled eyes. A deprecating smile quivered on her long upper lip.
She wavered into the small llowcr shop timorously, like a leaf
in an uncertain breeze.
About her angular body, inappropriate chifl'on vaguely
floated. She somehow resembled the aimless philodendron
drooped in the llorist's window. Her hands 11 uttered placat
inglv, half raised in defense as she answered the brisk shop
girl.
"I want to buy—l think I want to buy—some flowers —"
Her voice trailed into silence. To such situations the sales
girl was more than equal.
"We have lovely chrysanthemums today. The carnations
arc beautiful too. Of course, I personally always prefer vio
lets. Are they for a friend?"
"Yes," breathed her relieved patron.
"For a gentleman or a lady?"
The flowered chill'on fluttered desperately, retreated a step
or two, then gathered resolution.
"For a gentleman," she panted, and then gulped at her own
temerity.
"Then you want chrysanthemums, the small ones. Always
get bright colors for men."
"Chrysanthemums," agreed her client gratefully. And
then, with unexpected hardihood, "Pretty yellow ones. About
two dollars' worth—or, do you think—"
"Here," said the sales girl, "is a card, And there is a pen.
Write your message while I pick out the Mowers."
The chill'on drifted obediently to the spindly writing desk
between potted palm and fern. In due course the chrysan
themums were gathered together and presented for inspec
tion.
"To whom do you want them sent?"
"To Mr. Charles —," began the chill'on boldly, but, shocked
by the sound of her own voice, finished almost in a whisper,
"—Smith!"
She mumbled the address and then gathered herself for
a supreme effort.
"I haven't finished the card," she quavered. "May I write
for another minute or two?"
The chrysanthemums in a leisurely way were rolled in
waxed paper, then in wrapping paper, a tag affixed. The sales
girl returned to the desk.
The card was blank. Her customer was bent over it, her
head on one side, shivering in her anxiety like a poplar in a
high wind. Her hand held the pen awkwardly, now and again
making brief slabs at the card as if, each time, she were about
to write furiously. Rut each lime she snatched it back and
resumed her tremulous consideration.
"Why don't you just savt 'With love,' or 'Love and kisses',"
suggested the girl.
The object of her advice turned a harassed face.
"This lias to be a special, a very special, message," she
explained apologetically.
"Take your time. The dowers won't be sent out till two,
anyway."
"No, no. I must do it at once, or I shan't have courage—"
Frantically the pen scribbled. The card was thrust into
an envelope, the envelope carefully sealed and presented with
two humid paper dollars.
"You'll see that it's delivered —to him—personally?"
"Surely."
"Thank you. Good-bye."
The chiffon departed like a dismayed whirlwind, leaving
the shop much stiller. The morning passed.
At one o'clock the telephone jangled. The sales girl choked
down her last bit of cheese sandwich and answered il. The
voice of her erstwhile customer sounded faintly.
"Have you sent—are chrysanthemums gone to Mr. Smith
yet ?"
"Not yet."
"Well, I hate lo trouble you, but would it be too much—
would you mind taking oil' the card and—and tearing it up?"
"Not at all."
"I wouldn't bother you, but it really is important that he
shouldn't receive that —message. I thai is, you know how
one sometimes regrets things- "
"I'll destroy it right away."
"Thank you so very, very much!"
The sales girl pulled the small square white envelope from
the bundle of Mowers. With an avid smile she ripped it
open. In ragged, rectangular handwriting, the card bore a
single word:
"Perhaps!"
She was a tall, thin woman with an equine face and star
tled eyes. A deprecating smile quivered on her long upper lip.

"Thank you. Good-bye."
The chiffon departed like a dismayed whirlwind, leaving
the shop much stiller. The morning passed.
At one o'clock the telephone jangled. The sales girl choked
down her last bit of cheese sandwich and answered il. The
voice of her erstwhile customer sounded faintly.
"Have you sent—are chrysanthemums gone to Mr. Smith
yet ?"
"Not yet."
"Well, I hate lo trouble you, but would it be too much—
would you mind taking oil' the card and—and tearing it up?"
"Not at all."
"I wouldn't bother you, but it really is important that he
shouldn't receive that —message. I thai is, you know how
one sometimes regrets things- "
"I'll destroy it right away."
"Thank you so very, very much!"
The sales girl pulled the small square white envelope from
the bundle of Mowers. With an avid smile she ripped it
open. In ragged, rectangular handwriting, the card bore a
single word:
"Perhaps!"
She was a tall, thin woman with an equine face and star
tled eyes. A deprecating smile quivered on her long upper lip.
She wavered into the small llowcr shop timorously, like a leaf
in an uncertain breeze.
About her angular body, inappropriate chifl'on vaguely
floated. She somehow resembled the aimless philodendron
drooped in the llorist's window. Her hands 11 uttered placat
inglv, half raised in defense as she answered the brisk shop
girl.
"I want to buy—l think I want to buy—some flowers —"
Her voice trailed into silence. To such situations the sales
girl was more than equal.
"We have lovely chrysanthemums today. The carnations
arc beautiful too. Of course, I personally always prefer vio
lets. Are they for a friend?"
"Yes," breathed her relieved patron.
"For a gentleman or a lady?"
The flowered chill'on fluttered desperately, retreated a step
or two, then gathered resolution.
"For a gentleman," she panted, and then gulped at her own
temerity.
"Then you want chrysanthemums, the small ones. Always
get bright colors for men."
"Chrysanthemums," agreed her client gratefully. And
then, with unexpected hardihood, "Pretty yellow ones. About
two dollars' worth—or, do you think—"
"Here," said the sales girl, "is a card, And there is a pen.
Write your message while I pick out the Mowers."
The chill'on drifted obediently to the spindly writing desk
between potted palm and fern. In due course the chrysan
themums were gathered together and presented for inspec
tion.
"To whom do you want them sent?"
"To Mr. Charles —," began the chill'on boldly, but, shocked
by the sound of her own voice, finished almost in a whisper,
"—Smith!"
She mumbled the address and then gathered herself for
a supreme effort.
"I haven't finished the card," she quavered. "May I write
for another minute or two?"
The chrysanthemums in a leisurely way were rolled in
waxed paper, then in wrapping paper, a tag affixed. The sales
girl returned to the desk.
The card was blank. Her customer was bent over it, her
head on one side, shivering in her anxiety like a poplar in a
high wind. Her hand held the pen awkwardly, now and again
making brief slabs at the card as if, each time, she were about
to write furiously. Rut each lime she snatched it back and
resumed her tremulous consideration.
"Why don't you just savt 'With love,' or 'Love and kisses',"
suggested the girl.
The object of her advice turned a harassed face.
"This lias to be a special, a very special, message," she
explained apologetically.
"Take your time. The dowers won't be sent out till two,
anyway."
"No, no. I must do it at once, or I shan't have courage—"
Frantically the pen scribbled. The card was thrust into
an envelope, the envelope carefully sealed and presented with
two humid paper dollars.
"You'll see that it's delivered —to him—personally?"
"Surely."
"Thank you. Good-bye."
The chiffon departed like a dismayed whirlwind, leaving
