Jonathan Bishop, by Hkiuikht (lomman. (Farrar and Rine
harl.) $2.50
Herbert (lonnan's slory of the Commune an<l of the Siege
of Paris is one of tlie most entertaining hooks in recent
months. Whether or not Mr. (lonnan's principal concern is
to compare Paris of the siege and Paris ot today, harassed as
it is by many troubles, Jonathan Bishop's principal contribu
tion is an artistic one. To he sure, the intelligent reader can
not linish tiiis work without pursuing disturbing, serious by
thought, but he likewise cannot fail to realize that the novel's
essential merit is literary.
Jonathan Bishop is a young New Englander who goes to
Paris, is picked up by ;i female spy, Madame Zinh, and llntfs
his entire mental altitude toward the war, and toward basic
emotional manifestations, inlluenced by her actions.
