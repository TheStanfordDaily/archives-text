Tin- llcsl Plays of 1 Mi? HK'I.'I, and llie Yearbook of Ihe Drama

1933.

The selection of the "best" plays of any one theatrical
season is, to some decree, an arbitrary business and one in
evitably leading to charges of undue presumption on the part
of the elector.
Hut, besides being a I'utile and on the whole quite thank
less task, it is one which leads easily to misconception. In
retrospection il may be seen I hat collections of this sort -
even were they injure fairly a representation of "the Theatre
in America" than this one is, despite its titular pretensions -
tend to be representative less of merit than of a momentary
frame of mind.
A glance through Mr. Mantle's increasing series of volumes
reveals omissions inexplicable at the lime of publication and
definitely unjustifiable as succeeding years permit a more
coolly critical perspective of past seasons.
For example, the season <<f 1919 1920 saw Ihe inclusion in
Ihc anthology of such swillly aging Irilies as "Adam and Eva"
and "Wedding Hells," all but ignored the production of Gorki's
"The Lower Depths." The anthology of 1925-192(> included
"The Green Hal" and "The Huller and Kgg Man"; relegated
"Hay Fever," Rostand's "The Last Night of Don Juan, I'lic
Man with a Loaf of Mischief" lo casual mention.
No play of George Hernard Shaw lias been given recog
nition as among the "best" and the realization that Shaw's
more important plays seem to ha\y been written some time
since cannot explain away thf failure of Mantle to include
either "Saint .loan" or "Caesar and Cleopatra."

Occasionally Mantle attempts lo make up a deficiency 100
late realized. Hut such attempts are usually unsatisfactory:
note the inclusion in this latest volume of Coward's "Design
for Living," scarcely bis best work and but a sad reciprocity
for the omission in the previous volumes of either "Private
Lives" (while the shoddy "Grand Hotel" and "Tomorrow and
Tomorrow" found places) or of the previously mentioned
"Hay Fever," perhaps the best of Coward's work to dale.
Bui in addition to these obvious problems, Mr. Mantle's
anthologies reveal a deeper deficit. His selection is limited not
lo the American theatre as bis title* implies, but to the Broad
way season in particular. He takes no cognizance of the fre
quently important experimentation in Little Theatres and
expands bis view of the American theatre only to include
hasty, ill-organized, and incomplete views of the seasons in
Chicago, San Francisco, and Southern California.
Such scant recognition as Little Theatres in these terri
tories receive is typified by such a summary as this one:
"Harold Helvenston, head of dramatics at Stanford University,
gave one of the few productions of Saki's "The Mistress of
Briony." While recognizing, however imperfectly, Ihe cour
age of such a project, the writer's view is so far from complete
as to be ludicrously misleading.
Of experimental groups, amateur or semi-professional, in
other parts of the nation —particularly in the South—no no
tice whatever is taken. This heterogeneous mixture is dis
tressingly muddled.
ill
Of Mantle's personal peculiarities it is not my design lo
take much note. He is unduly devoted to "folk" dramas and
pseudo-artistic or problem dramas—often of a distressingly
whimsical nature: "Green Grow the Lilacs," "Michael and
Mary," "Paris Hound." He is, as well, taken in by purely
topical plays which have sprung out of newspaper headlines,
ill-formed and shallow: "The Criminal Code," "Dancing Moth
ers."
His aim is not defined with suflicient clarity. In limiting
himself to the New York theatre it might be supposed that he
limits himsell as well t«> commercial successes. This is ob
viously no explanation, however, for the inclusion of such
plays as "Wild Birds," "Gypsy," "Alison's House," and "Over
ture"— none of them financially successes.
This uncertainly and distribution of purpose presents an
other fault of the work which, in addition to its unfulfilled
presumption, its frequently weird eccentricity in selection, its
necessarily limited perspective of any season as a whole, seems
to argue for the discontinuance of his practice, which gives no
indication in this latest volume of improvement.
There is no space here to discuss the more immediate and
material problems of Ihe anthologies, the wisdom and nature
of his condensations, bis curiously wavering viewpoint from
the critical lo the impersonal.
All of these matters hamper the book's statistical virtues,
and because this sort of anthology seems, in the final analysis,
valuable only as a summary of the theatre, il points to the
greater value of such a completely impersonal, uncritical list
ing as "Billboard" publishes annually. This yearly Mantle
hash is unsatisfactory because it fails in this essential respect,
atlcmpls without a linn critical basis, lo go farther.
