## Tax Dodgers Beware 
### 
Getting under way early, in Wash
ington House Ways and Means Com
mittee is busy thinking up ways to
close door against tax evaders.
Outcome of Pecora's muck-raking
has not been in convictions for
wrongdoing, but widespread belief
that tax Jaws need patching up.
Committee's recommendations will
make clever tax experts, lawyers,
think even harder trying to find
ways to dodge taxes. Changes are
aimed mostly at large stockholders
and gamblers, who deduct losses,
forget all about profits.
Uncle Sam is expected to be
$270,000,000 richer next year if pro
posed changes are made. What with
repeal money and prosperity looking
around the corner, it looks as though
the big, bad wolf will be kept at a
safe distance from the door of the
Treasuryâ€”if Congress doesn't feel
too generous.
