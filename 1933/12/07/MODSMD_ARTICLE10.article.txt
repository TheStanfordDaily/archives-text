# Women Leading Men As Speeding in Paly Rises
## 
### 
The women are catching up with
the menâ€”in fact they're ahead of
them at present as far as fast driv
ing is concerned.
Figures released by Police Judge
John E. Springer from an analysis
of speeding citations in Palo Alto
during this quarter show that the
men started out driving faster but
i have slowed down considerably
since then.
During October, 111 Stanford men
students were given tickets by the
ever- (in fact too) alert traffic of
ficers for speeding at an average of
34.(5 miles per hour. During this
time 31 coeds were arrested for driv
ing a mere 33.8.
The next period analyzed, the
first part of November, showed thai
j (he women were catchinf* up with

[ the masculine speeders. Forty-two
were caught doing 34.6 miles an hour
in Paly's quiet streets while the nine j
women apprehended were averaging
34.2.
The denoument came during the i
last half of November when four
Stanford women, inspired by the
Big Game spirit or something,
tramped on the accelerator for an
average of 35.6, leaving 31 campus i
males far behind them with only
t 32.8 miles an hour to show for them- j
selves.
Stanford students as a whole, it
was reported, observe the traffic
regulations as carefully as other res
idents. The statistics demonstrate
that during the past two months,
non-residents were guilty of the
fastest driving. |
