## 
### 
chalked up on the Stanford Union
Barber Shop chart and dope .sheet
yesterday morning before a sour
faced pessimist had the crust to
blot the sheet by marking down a
7-0 victory for Columbia. Sixty-two
of the other 64 predicted wins for
Stanford, while the remaining two
predicted 0-0 and 7-7 ties.
