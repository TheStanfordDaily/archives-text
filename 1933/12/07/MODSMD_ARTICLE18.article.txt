# CLUB PRESENTS GERMAN DRAMA
## 
### 
Giving an admirable production,
the German players of Stanford
University last night produced Max
Mell's "Das Apostelspiel." A sym
pathetic portrayal of the sincerity
and depth of the characters was
given, despite the fact that the play
was presented in a foreign language.
Kurt Frank Reinhardt, art direc
tor, deserves credit for his work,
while excellent lighting effects were
achieved by Hans H. Lesche.
Adclph Zech was outstanding in
his interpretation of the bolshcvist.
He, with a compatriot, Peter, char
acterized in striking manner by
Llewellyn McKay, comes to the cot
tage of an old man, .sympathetically
interpreted by Henry C. Lindgren.
His little granddaughter, Magdelan,
was played by Isabel Stowell, who
appealingly portrayed deeply reli
gious character of Magdelan.
| The story concerns the visit of
the bolshevists, who are mistaken
by Magdelan to be the Apostles, and
who questions them concerning
(Jesus and their relations with Him.
i Thinking it a humorous situation,
they take up their fictitious roles,
I but enter more seriously into them,
with the conception of themselves as
; spreaders of a new socialistic doc

! nes to read her a passage of his
work, he is overwhelmed with re
morse, and leaves the hut with
; Peter, humilated at his attempt to
delude the child.
Thus was the question of the per-
Jennial value of Christmas principles
put to the test, against the bolshevis
tic gospel of today; and the answer,
hinging on the all-pervading power
I of truth and love, was revealed in
| a performance almost flawless, <
