# U.C. Medico Advocates Early Football Practice
## 
### 
Because most injuries incurred by
football players occur in the first
part of every season, Dr. W. G. Don
ald, varsity football squad physician
at the University of California, ad
vises early fall practices.
The doctor pointed out that men
go into major contests in the early
part of every season not in proper
condition which results in many in
juries. If practice were held three
weeks before the first games, how
ever, he believes that injuries would
be greatly reduced.
