# No "Beer" Signs in Paly As Campus Speaks Fold
## 
### 
With the chaste thoroughfares of
j Palo Alto lacking even a "Beer on
' Draught" sign, Stanford students
J add to their repeal troubles the pass
| ing of a great race — the campus
I bootlegger. He is gone—never to re
turn, unless the Anti-Saloon League
stages a come-back.
Frightened by the threats of real
enforcement, under the new era, the
majority of the bootleggers have
heeded the call of the great god,
Legality, and have turned to more
jlawlul means of earning a living
than selling liquor to thirsty Stan
fordites.
Bargain sales, where the last of
the synthetic gin and "rot-gut"
whiskey were marked down to half
price, were a feature of this week's

| pro-repeal excitement. Now the
1 "jernts" are locked, boarded lip, si-J
i lent reminders to future generation]
of "where college boys used to spend i
their evenings back in 1920-\'}3."
The campus bootlegger who occu
' pies a unique place in the stormy
history of Prohibition went without
regrets, grumbling that student trade
has always been unreliable and j
likely to got the owner of the speak
i easy into trouble.
With repeal, many of them plan
Ito sell out altogether and go into i
the wholesale liquor business. Others
intend to take out licenses, provid
ing their place is outside the one
and one-half mile limit, A few j
hardies will continue to sell their
illegal brews, hoping to offset the
| legal competition by lower prices. |
