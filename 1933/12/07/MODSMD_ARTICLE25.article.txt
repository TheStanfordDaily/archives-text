Drew's Statement
President of the Class of '36 Bill
Drew made the following statement:
"The sophomore class has been
looking forward to bringing the Uni
versity together at the first all-cam
pus formal of this year.
"Realizing that it was toward the
■ end of the quarter when everybody
has few dollars, the committee, with
, the aid of Les Hables and General
Hugh Johnson, has been able to cut
1 the price on the dance to a new
J low of $2.50. Furthermore, many
1 new features are included in the
! price.
"The class hopes to see all of the
i new and different 800 on Friday at
9 o'clock."

j "I have watched this dance
| emerge from infancy until no# on
] the eve of the formal, I feci confi
dent that this year's cotillion will
rank among the immortal proms
that have been given at Stanford.
"Members of the committee de
j serve much praise for the excep
tional way in which they have
1 brought this dance along. Only a
limited number of bids will be sold,
