# RUMWELL EDICT REVERSED; BEER GETS BOOT TOE
## Decision to Change Former Stand Results From Study of Law ROTH EXPLAINS MOVE Legal Technology Provides Loophole for Drys 
### Jay Graves 
Executing a distinct and abrupt
about face from his position out
lined to Daily representatives yes
terday, City Attorney Arnold Rum
well in an opinion issued late last
night ruled against the sale of 3.2
beer and winos in Palo Alto.
The move came as a surprise after
an earlier announcement carried by
the Daily yesterday to the effect
that such sales would be permitted.
Constitution Amendment
Later last evening, Rumwell could
not be reached, but University
Comptroller ALmon E. Roth ex
pressed the opinion that Rumwell's
reversal of stand was the result of
further study of the recent amend
ment of the California constitution.
According to the latest construc
tion placed upon the recent provi
sions governing the distribution of
intoxicating liquors in California,
local ordinance restrictions are re
moved only insofar sis "intoxicating
liquors" are concerned.
If Roosevelt beer is intoxicating,
then the deed restrictions held by
the University hold. If it is not in
toxicating by definition, and the
court decisions so far have held this,
then the California amendment does
not affect its distribution and the
local ordinance against the sale of
"alcoholic" beverages still holds.
Police Chief Non-Committal
Rumwell reached this decision
based on the logic of the situation
at about noon yesterday, according
to Roth, who was one of the first to
know of the ruling regarding such
sales in Palo Alto.
Police Chief Zink last night was
non-committal regarding the stand
ho would take. He awaited further
clarification of the situation; consis
tency of stand regarding what may
legally be sold and what may not
be sold.
Rumwell's move yesterday, it was
learned on good authority, was ac
tuated by continued calling of Palo
Alto merchants and potential beer
dispensers to determine whether or
not they would be within the law.
Further study than he had previ
ously given to the situation revealed
the one loop-hole in the law by
which Palo Alto may remain dry.
This morning finds thirsty Stan
ford students in a perplexing di
lemna. Just where beer and inci
dentally, "harder stuff" can be
bought still remains a question. So
far, Menlo is the only reliable
stronghold.

"alcoholic" beverages still holds.
Police Chief Non-Committal
Rumwell reached this decision
based on the logic of the situation
at about noon yesterday, according
to Roth, who was one of the first to
know of the ruling regarding such
sales in Palo Alto.
Police Chief Zink last night was
non-committal regarding the stand
ho would take. He awaited further
clarification of the situation; consis
tency of stand regarding what may
legally be sold and what may not
be sold.
Rumwell's move yesterday, it was
learned on good authority, was ac
tuated by continued calling of Palo
Alto merchants and potential beer
dispensers to determine whether or
not they would be within the law.
Further study than he had previ
ously given to the situation revealed
the one loop-hole in the law by
which Palo Alto may remain dry.
This morning finds thirsty Stan
ford students in a perplexing di
lemna. Just where beer and inci
dentally, "harder stuff" can be
bought still remains a question. So
far, Menlo is the only reliable
stronghold.
