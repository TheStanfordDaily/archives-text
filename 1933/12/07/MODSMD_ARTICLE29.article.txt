Arguments against the Bawl-Out have been advanced.
Sonic of these arguments have been partially refilled. Oth
ers have gone unanswered. Hut that is neither there nor
here.
The startling fact is that no great constructive idea in
favor of this little imp has been advanced.
The biggest argument that now holds the Bawl-Out
where il is, is gravity. It is there. Therefore, it is there.
Therefore, conclusively, and beyond a shadow of a doubt,
il is there. With gravity, there is no argument. With the
Hawl-Oul, there is plenty of argument indicating the star
llingly useless character of the (IHADK-POINT column in
this booklet.
The Hawl-Oul must go.
