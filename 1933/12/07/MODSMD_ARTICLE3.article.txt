# The
						Morning After

### 
The U.S. woke up after its repeal
celebration without a hangover. Pro
hibition was buried in 19 .states
without ceremony. Reason: things
have been wide open for some time
so there is little to celebrate; hastily
passed laws bawling things up in
several places.
F.R. warned states to prevent re
turn to saloon, urged national edu
cation temperance program.
Meanwhile Washington liquor con
trol chief mapped a program which
will eventually yield cheap liquor—
tentative price for the next few
weeks or months set at $1.50 quart.
That's figuring the tax at $1.10 a
gallon. Reason for cheap drunks,
not altruism, but an additional
means of getting lid of the boot
legger.
