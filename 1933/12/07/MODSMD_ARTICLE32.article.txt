The re was a lime when il was considered (juile the thing
to paint Cat's "C" red. They in turn considered il the best
of form to attempt a premature burning of our bonfire.
That may have been all rigid; hut it didn't stop there.
Nothing ever is kept on a simple plane. Several years
ago what were rumored to be California students came
trouping to the campus in the dead of night, and smeared
blue and gold paint all over the Quad, euphemistically
speaking. Fortunately for us, thev spared the Church. The
mosaics went unscathed.
That same year, it was very fortunate that Cal did not
raid the bonfire, for casualties would have resulted. The
frosh were ready, eager for battle. Armed with clubs, and
surrounded by bonfire entanglements, they wanted some
Cal skulls to bash in, seemed disappointed when none pre
sented themselves.
This year, we burned "S" on their grass, tliev branded
our greensward with "C."
If nothing is done, very probably next year the v will
invade the President's oflice, and carve "C"s on Wilbur's
desk. We will not be outdone; will stamp k 'S"s on Sproul's
vest. Possibilities .abound.
The Kxecutive Committee has taken action. That action
is backed bv the Administration. It is only a reasonable
manifestation of the instinct of self-preservation for stu
dents to listen. Those who swoop down on the Cal cam
pus will be exterminated, academically speaking.
Now, Stanford is a nice place. If you desire to slick
around continuously, stifle nit marauding instincts.
