## CHANGE GRID SCHEDULE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Does the Board of Athletic Con
trol wish to increase its revenues
and incidentally give greater foot
ball enjoyment to bay-region fans?
Here are some suggestions:
Variety is the spice of football, as
it is of life in general. Why do Stan
ford teams face the same opponents
year after year, when other and
just as worthy ones are at hand?
Surely the coaching stafl is not
afraid of a more varied schedule.
And would not greater mixture in
the team's football diet from season
to season mean added strength for
Rose Bowl competition?
Specifically, why the neglect of
Washington State and the University
of Oregon? Each this year defeated
its state rival which usually graces
our schedule.
How about our playing the Uni
versity of Washington and Oregon
State one season, and Washington
State followed by the University ol
Oregon the next, or any other alter
nate arrangement? Such a schedule
should go fur in keeping fan-interest
alive. In two years' time a team
passes through greater changes and
is thus more problematical as to
strength than is usually the case
from one year to the next. A similar
arrangement might be made with the
Universities of Montana and Idaho,
as well as with Santa Clara and St.
Mary's.
And now about ticket prices: It is
appreciated that some reductions
have been made since the oaslaught
of the depression. Suffice it to say,
however, that said reductions have
not, in many cases, followed the de
pression trend all the way. The
writer would be interested to know
just how many customers at $1 a
head the Board of Athletic Control
expected for the Montana game
when everyone knew that the draw
ing "Cards" probably would be
warming the bench and saving their
tomahawks for the Bears.
Surely this game, at such a time,
is hardly worth the price asked, and
the fans knew it. Either admission
charges for this and similar games
should be reduced, or attractions
should be added to insure value for
value exchange.
For instance, why the secrecy
about the game between the Stan
ford Greys and the California Ram
blers? These reserve squads play
better football on the average than
do the freshman teams, and the an
nual presentation of their battle in
the stadium should do much to bol
ster up otherwise uninviting pro
grams.
Yours for better business in the
B.A.C.
