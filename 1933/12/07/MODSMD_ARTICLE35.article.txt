# CAP AND GOWN PUT ON A VERY WARM SPOT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
One of the hotbeds of feminine
strife and sour grapes on this cam- I
pus has again reared its ugly head
—the elections to Cap and Gown,
senior women's honorary society.
Just what is the honor has long j

been in doubt. Just what good the
body does has longer been in doubt.
At all events, present members
have indicated a desire to make
membership an automatic affair
composed of presidents of various
campus units and women editors.
Now if the majority of active mem
bers want this rule, why don't they
go ahead with it? Alumnae are
continually inserting the beagle un
til they look like a bunch of peren
nial freshmen-with a corresponding
amount of intelligence. Present-day
exigencies, if they exist, should
rule; not the problems and tradi
tions of last year or ten years ago.
Women here are too prone to col
lapse at first argument; the action
of Women's Council after the U.S.C.
game two years ago concerning "a
certain student " was an admirable
blotch showing their sheep-like ten
dencies.
Three members have gone so far
as to resign. That shows commend
able spirit for the others to follow.
The amendment is in the constitu
tion; only active members can vote.
It is a gretjt opportunity for women
students of this campus to finally
show that I hey possess souls of their
own.
On the other hand, why give auto
matic membership to a group of
women presidents? Certainly the
winner of the annual Pan-Hell fiasco
is meaningless depending solely
upon which house can first get. three
other tongs to vote for their woman
in exchange for Lord knows what.
The presidency of A.W.S. may come
via another clique on the row with
the W.A.A. presidency part of the
same deal. That's happening only
too often. And, in the future, it
looks as though both jobs will go tb
Roble and Union women with mo
notonous regularity.
Women editors at least work four
years to get their positions, with
slightly less wire-pulling and tong
warfare. But why leave out the
Quad and Chaparral women man
agers? Judging from past perform
ances, they do more actual work
than either the Quad or Daily wo
men editors.
Under this new system, persons of
ability and actual leadership, but
holding inferior offices, may easily
be left out. Thougfc they all may or
may not have been members of the
organization, such persons as Max
ine Cushing, Miriam Strout, Marian
Hewlett, Collier Council, Maxine
Yaple, Helen Uullmann, Mary Anita.
Loos, Helen Eisner, Barbara Collins,
Lucille Morgan, Hildur Richardson,
and Katherine Keho might be left
without the brass of Cap and Gown.
The neW rule will cause women to
seek stereotyped positions rather
than to promote general welfare. It
seems that the older, more flexible
standard of election is to be pre
ferred. After all, what if "petty pol
itics" may be used in choosing mem
bers; surely it is no worse than the
politics used in placing women in
positions wherefrom they may be
chosen.
Which reverts us to the question
—what good does Cap and Gown do
and what honor is involved? Appar
ently it is "social contact between
selected present and former lead
ers"; a society of "social and emo
tional purpose" based upon "per
sonal dislikes, disagreeable person
ality traits and sorority affiliations."
Sickening, isn't it? Abolition seems
singularly appropriate unless a new
purpose is conceived or the "hon
orary" is dropped.

Under this new system, persons of
ability and actual leadership, but
holding inferior offices, may easily
be left out. Thougfc they all may or
may not have been members of the
organization, such persons as Max
ine Cushing, Miriam Strout, Marian
Hewlett, Collier Council, Maxine
Yaple, Helen Uullmann, Mary Anita.
Loos, Helen Eisner, Barbara Collins,
Lucille Morgan, Hildur Richardson,
and Katherine Keho might be left
without the brass of Cap and Gown.
The neW rule will cause women to
seek stereotyped positions rather
than to promote general welfare. It
seems that the older, more flexible
standard of election is to be pre
ferred. After all, what if "petty pol
itics" may be used in choosing mem
bers; surely it is no worse than the
politics used in placing women in
positions wherefrom they may be
chosen.
Which reverts us to the question
—what good does Cap and Gown do
and what honor is involved? Appar
ently it is "social contact between
selected present and former lead
ers"; a society of "social and emo
tional purpose" based upon "per
sonal dislikes, disagreeable person
ality traits and sorority affiliations."
Sickening, isn't it? Abolition seems
singularly appropriate unless a new
purpose is conceived or the "hon
orary" is dropped.

The Editor, Sir:
One of the hotbeds of feminine
strife and sour grapes on this cam- I
pus has again reared its ugly head
—the elections to Cap and Gown,
senior women's honorary society.
Just what is the honor has long j

been in doubt. Just what good the
body does has longer been in doubt.
At all events, present members
have indicated a desire to make
membership an automatic affair
composed of presidents of various
campus units and women editors.
Now if the majority of active mem
bers want this rule, why don't they
go ahead with it? Alumnae are
continually inserting the beagle un
til they look like a bunch of peren
nial freshmen-with a corresponding
amount of intelligence. Present-day
exigencies, if they exist, should
rule; not the problems and tradi
tions of last year or ten years ago.
Women here are too prone to col
lapse at first argument; the action
of Women's Council after the U.S.C.
game two years ago concerning "a
certain student " was an admirable
blotch showing their sheep-like ten
dencies.
Three members have gone so far
as to resign. That shows commend
able spirit for the others to follow.
The amendment is in the constitu
tion; only active members can vote.
It is a gretjt opportunity for women
students of this campus to finally
show that I hey possess souls of their
own.
On the other hand, why give auto
matic membership to a group of
women presidents? Certainly the
winner of the annual Pan-Hell fiasco
is meaningless depending solely
upon which house can first get. three
other tongs to vote for their woman
in exchange for Lord knows what.
The presidency of A.W.S. may come
via another clique on the row with
the W.A.A. presidency part of the
same deal. That's happening only
too often. And, in the future, it
looks as though both jobs will go tb
Roble and Union women with mo
notonous regularity.
Women editors at least work four
years to get their positions, with
slightly less wire-pulling and tong
warfare. But why leave out the
Quad and Chaparral women man
agers? Judging from past perform
ances, they do more actual work
than either the Quad or Daily wo
men editors.
