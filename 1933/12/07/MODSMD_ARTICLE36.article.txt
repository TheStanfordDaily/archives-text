# Dean Hits Bawl-Out In Statement to Daily
## 
### 
Editor's Note: The Daily contacted Dean of Men George Bliss Culver,
requested his opinion on the much-discussed Bawl-out. The Dean's opin
ion, hacked by long experience at Stanford, follows:

With the single exception of its'
publication of individual plus or
minu? totals I feel that the Directory
of Officers and Students, or so-called
Bawl-out is an exceedingly useful
and worth-while publication.
However, I have always felt that
the grade point publication is
highly undesirable because in
many instances it gives a totally j
unfair presentation of the most
personal aspect of a student's
academic life.
I might feel differently about this
matter if along with such publica
tions there should be the informa
tion that so and so has these grades
possibly or probably because he has
a chronic sinus infection or that he
was in the hospital for three or four
weeks, or that he is carrying the
burden of an impending separation
in his family, or because his work
ing all night in some electric sub
station, or has for years been wash
ing dishes in some cafe or restaurant.
If along with the publication there
could be some picture of his prepa
ratory school background, of the
hundred and one things that influ
ence his grades—laziness, love, in
fatuation, discouragement, but why
attempt to enumerate them?
The Scholastic Committee in its
review of individual cases considers
these matters very carefully and 1
very generously. Frequently it tries
to evaluate them mathematically.
Some one may attempt to answer
my argument by calling attention
to the fact that the Committee does
allow in many instances grade 1
points because of them. I am glad
that it does, but nothing is pub
lished. There are many instances in j
which the sufferer never presents his '
case.
I am not opposed to the grade
point system, hut simply to its
public broadcast. Why is it that
the University never publishes in
dividual aptitude test scorcs? Why
is it that it never gives out even
to the individual his exact rating,
except as to his group standing?
It learned from experienced that
it is best not to publish such rat- \
ings. ;
Personally I can see little differ
ence between publishing aptitude |
test ratings and grade point ratings.
II the publication of tine might de- I
velop a feeling of inferiority in the j
individual why would not the pub- i
lication of the other have the same i
effect? I know that it very fre
quently does and along with it there
is very often a spirit of helpless
resentment that his fellow students I

and even his home town community
should know all about it.
To me these elements coming
into one's educational career are
not helpful. The individual stu
dent in such cases feels that it
should be purely a matter between
himself and the Registrar's office
as to his grade points. lie knows
that he must secure a certain
number of points if he is to re
main in the school or to graduate.
Personally I have a great pride in
my University. I want others to
have that same feeling, but when I
go into other communities, say Los
Angeles, and some family waves a
Bawl-out in my lace and demands
that I explain how students with
such grades as these remain in col
lege—(l take the figures from the
current Bawl-out) —13-36, 24-33, 64-
44, 144-51, 58-33 —well, it is difficult
to explain about "incompletes," the
scholastic standing as maintained or
recorded by the Scholarship Com
mittee and the Registrar's office,
etc., etc. The whole thing looks to
the outsider like a very lax regu
lation or condition as to scholarship.
The argument that the publication
of grade points is an incentive to
better scholarship is sometimes ad
vanced. I very much doubt that it
really has this effect. In this con
nection it may be pertinent to point
out that students usually selected
for their great scholastic ability—
under the Independent Study Plan
—have no grade points published.
The best incentives to scholar
ship, aside from the love and de
sire for learning which students
have and should have aside from
published emoluments, come from
the possibility of being elected to
Phi Beta Kappa—a real distinc
tion—and the awards of Lower
Division and Graduate honors.
There might have been a time
long ago when the publication of
individual grade point attainments
was worth while in letting the stu
dent know just where he stood in
reference to all his University work.
However, with the very comprehen
sive and inclusive University record
that is now presented to each stu
dent at the close of each quarter by
th Registrar, he has the complete
record, a photostatic copy of his rec
ord as it exists in the Registrar's
office.
George Bliss Culver,
Dean of Men.
