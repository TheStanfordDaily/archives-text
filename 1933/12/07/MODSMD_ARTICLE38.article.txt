Still inseparable her nose and
thumb, Dorothy Parker in her sec
ond book of prose demonstrates her
amazingly keen ability to analyze
her fellow man and (more especi
ally) woman. And she matches her
analytical ability wiih a literary
style and a trenchant wit that make
"Alter Such Pleasures" even more
memorable than her delightful verse.
Mrs. Parker's attitude is expressed
throughout the book in a variety of
disguises, but one constantly senses
her rebellion against the stupidity
and futility of the lives of many
wedded . couples, her bitterness at
the addle-pated debutantes with
which the world is cursed, and her
disdain for synthetic emotions.
Two of the sketches are less col
ored with this bitterness, and the re
sults are screamingly funny. "The
Waltz," which relates the thoughts
of a young lady while dancing, is
the cleverest prose sketch Mrs. Par
ker has ever written. The lines are
delightfully quotable:
"How do you do, Mr. Jukes?
And how is that dear little brother
of yours, with the two heads?
.... Oh, yes, do let's dance to
gether—it's so nice to meet a man
who isn't a scaredy-cat about
catching my beri-beri."
"The Little Hours" is almost as
funny, telling the ruminations of a
young lady who has made the great
mistake of going to bed early and
who is unable to get to sleep, and
who, among other things, refuses to
count sheep:
"They needn't think I'm going to
lie here in the dark and count
their unpleasant little faces for
them; I wouldn't do it if I didn't
fall asleep until the middle of next
August."
Of quite a different mould are
"Too Bad" and "Here We Are,"
which show in a savagely bitter
manner the utter stupidity and
emptiness of wedded bliss.
The stupidest possible females are
revealed with biting realism in "The

AFTER SUCH PLEASURES. By Dorothy Parker
(New York. The Viking Press, 1933)

Diary of a Lady," "Lady with a
' Lamp," and "A Young Woman in
Green Lace"—all three of them
singularly alike in the triviality of
thought and speech of the charac
ters.
A genuinely pathetic picture of a
young woman over-in-love with a
worthless Lothario is presented in
"Dusk Before Fireworks," and there
is pathos too in "Horsie."
In short, it is a delightful vol
ume, at the end of which one might
well quote John Donne, the source
' of the title;
"Ah. cannot we,
As well as cocks and lions jocund
he,
After such pleasures?"
