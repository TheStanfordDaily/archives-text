# Summer Practice Planned For Student Barristers
## 
### 
Plans by which law students may
spend the summer working in the
' offices of California lawyers are be
ing formulated by the local law de
partment in conjunction with the
Northern and Southern California
Stanford Law societies, composed of
' graduates of the local school.
The idea, which will be experi-
I mental in nature here, will provide
first and second-year law men with
an opportunity to gain practical ex
perience in their work, and to make
! connections in the cities in which
j they intend to practice. Although
! the number to take advantage of
this schedule will necessarily be
i limited by the places available, it is
expected that about 20 will be
I placed.
