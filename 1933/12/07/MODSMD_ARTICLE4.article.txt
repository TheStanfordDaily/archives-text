# FTC Joins NRA
## 
### 
New thunderbolt was today to be
found in NRA Eagle's clawâ€”the
Federal Trade Commission. This
venerable body was aiding in new
disciplinary steps in codified indus
try. Investigation and correction is
expected from FTC (more initials)
in Ihe future.
N.Y.'s retail cleaning stores and
Outlet Association comes up on
NRA's carpet Monday. Charge: en
couragement of minimum price vio
lations.
FTC's first stroke for the Recov
ery program was in San Antonio,
Texas, where it reported having ob
tained compliance from an ice man
ufacturer that he would cease en
gaging in forbidden trade practices.
