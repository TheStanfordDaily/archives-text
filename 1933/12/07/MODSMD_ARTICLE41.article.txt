# TAOS PLAY WORK OF STANFORDITE
## 
### 
Maxwell Anderson, author of
"Niyht Over Taos," scheduled for
production at the new civic theatre
oil Middlefield Road and Melville
Avenue, on Friday and Saturday,
December 15-16, was a graduate stu
dent taught English composition at
Stanford in 1913-14. He was regis
tered from Minnewaukan, North
Dakota. After receiving his Master
of Arts degree from the University,
Anderson taught English at Whittier
College, and subsequently, drifted
into newspaper work on the San
Francisco Call-Bulletin and the San
Francisco Chronicle.
It is said that one of the San Fran
cisco papers dismissed the now-fa
mous playwright for his outspoken
attitude, but not easily discouraged,
he kept doggedly at his writing of
poems and plays, until this year his
efforts have been rewarded by the
winning of the annual Pulitzer
prize with "Both Your Houses." An
derson likes to write his dramas in
verse because lie believes that all
great plays were written in verse.
"Night Over Taos," like "Elizabeth,
the Queen," is composed in poetic
dialogue.
Reserved seats for both perform
ances may be secured at the Palo
Alio Community House on the high
way and University Avenue, or by
telephoning P.A. 21711. All tickets
are 50c each.
The University of Minnesota has
recently devised a plan to pay needy
students $15 a month to help defray
the expenses of board and room.
