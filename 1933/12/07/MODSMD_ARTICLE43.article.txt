# GEOLOGY PROFESSOR TO ISSUE TEXTBOOK
## C. F. Tolman Tells Problem Of Water Supply 
### 
Writing the first textbook in Eng
lish upon the subject of ground
water is the work which has been
occupying the attention of geology
Professor C. F. Tolman for the past
six years, and will probably be added
to the list of Stanford publications
in the near future.
Smiling, white-haired Professor
Tolman tells the importance of
ground water to California, states
that the reason his work is the first
survey to be made on the subject
is that the West is fundamentally
interested in the situation of water.
Here, not only geologists, but law
yers and engineers come in contact
with the problem, the case of the
Los Angeles interest in the water
supply of the Owens' Valley serving
as illustration.
Professor Tolman has, naturally,
been particularly interested in the
region around here, and the sinknig
of the ground around San Jose has
come in for detailed mention in the
volume.
At present a first mimeographed
edition has been issued for the bene
fits of the stone-observant students,
and is now in use.
