## 
### Janet Hartmenshen 
When the Apache opens its doors
Saturday night in the heart of the
Barbary Coast, its hostess will be
Collier Connell, Stanford '33.

Miss Connell while sheltered in
the cloistered atmosphere of the
Farm was well known for her work
on the Daily and Quad staffs. She
was feature editor of the Daily, later
I night editor, and assistant managing
editor during 1932.
As for night-club-hostessing, she
has not had a great deal of experi
ence but is relying rather on her
; tact, typical of all Stanford's women,
j to pull her through any tight spots
which she might encounter.
Leaving in June of 1933, Miss
i Connell cast about for a suitable
I means of self - expression. That

means she has at last found in the
re-creation of a typical Barbary
Coast hostelry. As Collier says,
"Most of these new places are so
tame that they are insipid. There is
no use trying to start a place on the
Coast unless it lives up to the glo
rious past of the district. As nearly
as possible, The Apache will be the
old Barbary Coast."
The club will be housed in a long
abandoned sausage factory, and
•nany vestiges of the manufacturing
Uill remain although the walls have
been considerably brightened by
murals, the work of ArnautofT, a
3upil of Diego Rivera. His paintings
:over a tremendous range: from the
struggles of the early sausage mak
ers to the vicissitudes of modern
Irinking.
