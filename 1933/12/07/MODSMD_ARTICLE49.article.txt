## 
### 
Following last week's announce
| ment by the B.A.C. that the Band
would be sent south for the Rose
; Bowl games, the group of red-coated
musicians have started once more
to prepare a routine of elaborate
! formations to add to the New Year's
Day spectacle.
Under the direction of the veteran
Bill Okker, six-foot-eight drum
major, the band worked out a pro
gram for the S.C. game, and ex
tended it for the Big Game. Much
favorable comment has been re
i ceived as to the snappy appearance
of the band on the field before the
Cal game.
The routine for the Rose Bowl
; game will be somewhat the same as
that used in the Big Game, and will
in addition feature the spelling of
the entire names of Columbia and
Stanford on the field, something sel
dom done by college bands on the
Coast.
Present plans indicate that the
i*roup will represent Stanford in the
Tournament of Roses parade that
will precede the game on New
Year's Day.
Working until too dark to see each
other down in the shade of the sta
dium on these winter afternoons,
the bandsmen hope to present to the
Rose Bowl audience on January 1
the snappiest performance in its line
' seen for many years.
