# CONSIDER THE LOWLY GOOF
## SIDELINE SLANTS 
### 
The goof, or as we style him here
at Stanford, the Gray, is a sad sub
ject. His afternoons, throughout the
football season, are spent in the
guise of a human punching bag. He
learns to take it, with gusto, and
rarely gets a chance to deal it out.
In time, the goof, or Gray, begins to
appreciate his position in the world;
he grows accustomed to it, he sees
his value, and with experience
gained he acquires a fierce pride in
hi.s profession, an actual joy in being
allowed to occupy a portion of the
field sacred to the varsity, and he
resents any interference with his
duties.
Here at Stanford, the coaching
stall' used to be very solicitious over
the goof. They re-christened him
"Gray," and they gave him a pri
vate field with an abundance of
coaches at his service. He was ac
counted an important cog in the
football system, and rare indeed, was
the varsity star who had not served
his time with the Grays.
This year the Gray has become a
nonentity. He still has a large
coaching staff (three men who sup
posedly do nothing else during the
week-day afternoons but cater to hi.s
needs) ho still has his private field
(never utilized of late), and he still
is mythically, a "Gray." But the
Grays, as a team, are no more.
