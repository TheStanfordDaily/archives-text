# U.C. RAMBLERS BROKE UP PARTY
## 
### 
With the foimation of the Califor
nia Ramblers, the old California goof
team was broken up, and the Grays
lost their annual big game. Coach
Thornhill and his .staff concentrated
on developing the crop of new men;
I hey had no time to trifle with the
reserves. The Grays came out for a
while, and hung around in the cor
ner of the field, a sheepish lot, and
the squad began dwindling, until
there were hardly enough to pro
vide dummy scrimmage for the var
sity, and when they were working
the Trojan plays, Coach Walt Hei
neke had to fill in at center.
Now it is our contention that the
Gray should be given some consid
eration. He is generally a fellow
that is crazy to play football, other
wise he wouldn't be out there. Prop
erly treated, Grays are fruitful
sources for new material. Men get
experience there, and coaches are
enabled to see what an untried
player does under fire. And in the
long run, the more men that are

kept interested in football, and that
continue to come out for football,
and that never give up trying to
I make the team, the better will the
varsity be.
