# GRAYS DESERVE A NEW DEAL
## 
### 
We suggest to Coach Thornhill
and his associates, that next year
the goof be given a break. He'll ap
preciate it. The coaches, the equip
i ment, and the space are available;
it won't cost much to put them to
I use. A game or two ought to be
scheduled, with ihe San Jose re
! serves, or the S.F.U. reserves, or
someone. St. Mary's may even have
a lot of seventh-string men handy
whom they would consent to send
! down.
Even better, of course, would be
the formation of a Ramblers team,
such as now exists at California.
Those players lose a year of com
, petition, it is true, but they learn
; much more football in a year on
such a team than in a season spent
j moping in the corner.
We have been told that the Ram
blers are too expensive. Perhaps,
but if they can schedule games with
state college teams, C.0.P., the Ma-
J fines, etc., we see no reason why
they cannot be made a self-sustain
ing squad. People certainly paid
good money to see the U.C. Ramblers
perform this past year, and there is
no reason why they should not shell
out to see the Cards.
1 It has also been declared that there
] is not enough material to furnish a
Rambler squad. Well, there used to
| be a good number out for the Grays,
1 and we suspect that with promise of
j a regular schedule, enemy football
loving students that now languish in
| the libe of an afternoon would bQ
out trying to make the team.
