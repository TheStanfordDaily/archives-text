# CARDS PREPARING FOR TOUGH BATTLE WITH EASTERNERS
## 
### 
Doffing their uniforms and don
ning gray sweat suits, three teams
of varsity gridmen dashed gaily
through signal drill last night in
their second practice session since
the California game. With Ernie
Nevers and Jim Lawson in charge
until Tiny Thornhill returns, the
squad will practice three times a
week until time to leave for Pasa
dena after finals are over.
Bob Reynolds' leg injury was
healed enough for him to be back
on the job, although Wes Muller
and Bob Maentz were laid up with
a sprained ankle and a bad cold, re
spectively. With Muller away, Bill
Bates, veteran pivot man, moved
back into his old job at center.
Columbia Strong
Meanwhile reverberations from
the East seemed ominous enough to
squelch any possibility of overcon
fidence on the part of the Indians.
"Rip" Miller, Navy coach, whose
team played Army, Columbia, and
Princeton and who is therefore con
sidered somewhat of an authority
011 the subject, rates Columbia as
the strongest eleven of the trio.
"Columbia would beat Princeton
now, I think," stated Miller, after
referring to the Lions as a "smooth,
snappy, beautifully drilled combina
tion." Princeton beat the Midship
men by one touchdown after a hard
fought game, while Columbia won
14 to 7, piling up 15 first downs in
the bargain to three for the Navy.
Lack Reserves
Principal weakness of the Lions
seems to be an absence of good re
serve material, although their first
eleven is touted as one of the
smoothest-working aggregations in
the East. Ineligibility has taken Joe
Ferrera, veteran tackle, although
this loss is balanced by the restora
tion to eligibility of Joe Richavich,
another tackle. Ferrara, who is co
captain-elect of next year's team,
received his prep training at Kiski
along with Captain Cliff Montgom
ery, star quarterback of the Colum
bia team.
Stanford's last appearance in the
Rose Bowl found the Indians play
ing another Atlantic Seaboard team
when they faced Pittsburgh on New
Year's Day 1928. After a close con
test, Warner's team nosed out the
Panthers 7 to 6. The year before
Stanford had fought to a 7-7 tie
with Alabama. The Indians' other
appearance in the Rose Bowl was
against Notre Dame in 1925 when
the Ramblers won 27 to 10 despite
heroic work by Ernie Nevers.

when they faced Pittsburgh on New
Year's Day 1928. After a close con
test, Warner's team nosed out the
Panthers 7 to 6. The year before
Stanford had fought to a 7-7 tie
with Alabama. The Indians' other
appearance in the Rose Bowl was
against Notre Dame in 1925 when
the Ramblers won 27 to 10 despite
heroic work by Ernie Nevers.
Doffing their uniforms and don
ning gray sweat suits, three teams
of varsity gridmen dashed gaily
through signal drill last night in
their second practice session since
the California game. With Ernie
Nevers and Jim Lawson in charge
until Tiny Thornhill returns, the
squad will practice three times a
week until time to leave for Pasa
dena after finals are over.
Bob Reynolds' leg injury was
healed enough for him to be back
on the job, although Wes Muller
and Bob Maentz were laid up with
a sprained ankle and a bad cold, re
spectively. With Muller away, Bill
Bates, veteran pivot man, moved
back into his old job at center.
Columbia Strong
Meanwhile reverberations from
the East seemed ominous enough to
squelch any possibility of overcon
fidence on the part of the Indians.
"Rip" Miller, Navy coach, whose
team played Army, Columbia, and
Princeton and who is therefore con
sidered somewhat of an authority
011 the subject, rates Columbia as
the strongest eleven of the trio.
"Columbia would beat Princeton
now, I think," stated Miller, after
referring to the Lions as a "smooth,
snappy, beautifully drilled combina
tion." Princeton beat the Midship
men by one touchdown after a hard
fought game, while Columbia won
14 to 7, piling up 15 first downs in
the bargain to three for the Navy.
Lack Reserves
Principal weakness of the Lions
seems to be an absence of good re
serve material, although their first
eleven is touted as one of the
smoothest-working aggregations in
the East. Ineligibility has taken Joe
Ferrera, veteran tackle, although
this loss is balanced by the restora
tion to eligibility of Joe Richavich,
another tackle. Ferrara, who is co
captain-elect of next year's team,
received his prep training at Kiski
along with Captain Cliff Montgom
ery, star quarterback of the Colum
bia team.
