With the Stanford rugby men i
looking improved each night out, â– 
prospects for a warm tussle between |
the Cardinals and California in their
Canadian tour tryout December 1(5,
are constantly increasing.
The Stanford coaching staff has
divided the leading 30 candidates j
into two teams, the Red and the |
White, and last night the Reds ran |
away with the practice, displaying 1
the better backfield work.
The Red team now stands, after 1
several backfield alterations, with
Johnny Hitchcock, George Wyman,
and Gill in the front rank. Roger
Hager, Milt Keller, Bob Dondries, ;
Jack Walton in the second rank,
with Oscar Baer playing wing for
ward.
The backfield includes George
Fuller at halfback, Ray Lewis, first |
five; Bill Warren, second five; Waddy
White, center three-quarters; Lee
Irelan and Joe Vigna, wings; John
Mack, fullback.
The combination worked smoothly
and ran several touchdowns over!
the Whites.
With men now out for the game
increased to 54, the squad will play 1
an intra-squad game Saturday af
ternoon, admission free.
