# Council Adds Penalties To Tardy Traffic Violations
## 
### 
Presence of six traffic tags and the
absence of the respective violators
featured the weekly Men's Council
meeting held Tuesday in the ex
committee rooms in the old Union.
A bit stern, Chairman Arbuckle
said that he guessed the violators
knew that, no matter what their
fine was, the fact that they were not
present at this last meeting will in
crease the fines at the rate of a dol
lar a week as long as they are ab
sent from the meeting when sum
moned.
