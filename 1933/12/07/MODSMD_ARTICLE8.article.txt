# CULVER SCORES PUBLICATION OF GRADE RECORDS
## Printing Points Not Needed As Registrar Gives Full Report GIVES UNFAIR PICTURE Not Scholarship Incentive, Declares Dean 
### 
Condemning the traditional prac
tice of printing grade point records
in the Student and Faculty Direc
tory, as presenting an unfair picture
of the student and as a misconcep
tion of Stanford's scholastic stand
ing, Dean of Men George Culver
yesterday added his factually based
I statements to those of other admin
istrative leaders favoring the aboli
tion of published grade standings.
"I have always felt that the grade
| point publication is highly undesir
! able because in many instances it
! gives a totally unfair presentation
I of the most personal aspect of a stu-
I dent's academic life," he said.
Give False Impression
Mr. Culver explained that he
i might feel differently about the mat
ter if along with the grades could
' be printed the varied reasons back
j of the scholastic rating such as ill
ness, family troubles, or long work-
J ing hours.
! The grade point records as printed
I in the directory give a false im
| pression to outsiders of Stanford
students' scholastic ability and look
j like a very lax regulation or condi
tion as to scholarship.
"Personally I have a great pride
|in my University. I want others to
I have that same feeling, but when I
! go into other communities, say Los
Angeles, and some family waves a
Bawl-out in my face and demands
that I explain how students with
j such grades as these remain in col
i lege—well it's difficult to explain,"
| the Dean admitted.
Not Aid Grades
Claim that the publication of grade
j points is an incentive to better
| scholarship is doubted by the ad
ministrator. On this subject he
pointed out that students selected (
for independent study because of |
their superior ability have no grade)
points published. The greatest irt- i
i centives to scholarship, aside from
' the love and desire for learning,
j come from the possibility of being ;
I elected to Phi Beta Kappa and the
awards of Lower Division and
Graduate honors, according to the
veteran educator.
Not only does Mr. Culver consider
i the grade point publication unde- i
sirable, but also believes it to be I
entirely unnecessary with Ihe com
prehensive and inclusive University
record furnished to the student by ;
the Registrar at the close of each
| quarter.

Not Aid Grades

ministrator. On this subject he
pointed out that students selected (
for independent study because of |
their superior ability have no grade)
points published. The greatest irt- i
i centives to scholarship, aside from

awards of Lower Division and
Graduate honors, according to the
veteran educator.
Not only does Mr. Culver consider

entirely unnecessary with Ihe com

Condemning the traditional prac
tice of printing grade point records
in the Student and Faculty Direc
tory, as presenting an unfair picture
of the student and as a misconcep
tion of Stanford's scholastic stand
ing, Dean of Men George Culver
yesterday added his factually based
I statements to those of other admin
istrative leaders favoring the aboli
tion of published grade standings.
"I have always felt that the grade
| point publication is highly undesir
! able because in many instances it
! gives a totally unfair presentation
I of the most personal aspect of a stu-
I dent's academic life," he said.
Give False Impression
Mr. Culver explained that he
i might feel differently about the mat
ter if along with the grades could
' be printed the varied reasons back
j of the scholastic rating such as ill
ness, family troubles, or long work-
J ing hours.
! The grade point records as printed
I in the directory give a false im
| pression to outsiders of Stanford
students' scholastic ability and look
j like a very lax regulation or condi
tion as to scholarship.
"Personally I have a great pride
|in my University. I want others to
I have that same feeling, but when I
! go into other communities, say Los
Angeles, and some family waves a
Bawl-out in my face and demands
that I explain how students with
j such grades as these remain in col
i lege—well it's difficult to explain,"
