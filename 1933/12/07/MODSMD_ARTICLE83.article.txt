## 
### George Wilson 
Alumni, who met, rallied, and
helped students cheer Thornhill's
Indian Warriors to their victories
over S.C. and Cal, are now preparing
once more to give vent to their en
thusiasm as plans for the Rose Bowl
game become more definite, reports
Alumni Secretary Harlow Rotiiert.
"Graduate interest in the Colum
bia game should be practically as
great as that shown before the Big
Game this year, when reunions were
held as far away as Berlin," he

stated, and added: "An interesting
i sidelight on the Berlin meeting was
the broadcast of the group's singing
'Come Join the Band,' which was
picked up over the air by the Chi
cago club in their meeting."

Turning to the current subject of
discussion, Rothert was optimistic in
! his comments on the probable out
| come of the Rose Bowl game. "Nev
j er have chances for a Stanford Rose
| Bowl victory been quite as good as
this year," he said.
"Columbia, however, should not be
underrated," he continued. "Their
' one defeat at the hands of Princeton
1 should not be taken too seriously,
particularly when it is recalled that
the Indians suffered the same mis
fortune this season.
Cards Met Tougher Teams
"The margin should be Stan
ford's," he said, "when the caliber of j
each team's opponents is taken into I
consideration. The teams Tiny's men j
I have conquered this year have been
' generally better football teams than
those Columbia has met.
"The team that goes down from l
here for the New Year's game i
' should not suffer any let-down,
| since this will be the first Rose Bowl
! game for every one of them," he
concluded; "and they should play
. as well as or better than they did
| against either S.C. or Cal. The game
' should be close, and as colorful as
; any played on the Coast this year."
Students of the lower division
who are interested in Law as a ca
. reer were addressed last night by
Law School Dean M. R. Kirkwood
and Dr. H. J. Rathbun, associate
J professor of law, in Room 12.
