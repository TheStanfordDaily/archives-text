# PATTERN FOR WELL DRESSED STANFORD MIND RIGGED TO "WINDS OF FREEDOM"
## 
### JOYCE SMART 
With the New Year approaching, [
the alert Stanfordite would do well
to find which way the "winds of
freedom are blowing," in order that !
he may trim his mental sails ac
cordingly. Therefore the following
summary of what the well-dressed
Stanford mind wiil think in 1934: j
General Philosophy: One should
be light-heartedly skeptical of j
everything, and complacently cyni
cal, never, however, taking one's j
own cynicism seriously.
Politics: The only positive way to
keep well versed on political ques
tions is to carefully watch the i
Hearst newspapers, and take the op
posite stand on all issues.
Campus Topics: The Rally Com
mittee is rapidly replacing Pan-
Hellenic as the favorite object of
argument. Professors are being (

treated with good-natured tolerance.
The new women are no longer new
or news, but are looked upon with
approval.
Miscellaneous: As to general be
havior, good table manners are no
longer in vogue—one should ap
proach his food with childlike sim
plicity. Profanity is approved, but
gutter slang such as "Jeez," "nuts/
'lousy" is preferred. In the movies,
Mickey Mouse, Dietrich, and Kath
arine Hepburn are admired, but Ja
net Gaynor, Marion Davies, Wheeler
and Woolsey, and Constance Bennett
are not. All the rest are regarded
with indifference or toleration, but
never with enthusiasm. One no
longer jokes or moans about the
depression. One accepts it with stoic
calmness, and "undepressed" people
lay themselves open to a charge of
Philistinism.
