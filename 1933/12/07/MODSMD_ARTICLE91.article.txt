# League Reform
## 
### 
Italy launched a new program
yesterday in the hopes of inviegling
the Big Bad Four, U.S., Russia, Ja
pan, and Germany back into the fold
of the League of Nations, making ihc
latter really count for something.
No definite proposals from Rome
have yet been forthcoming, but it
is understood they will include era- i
sure of League articles binding sig
natories to use military and eco
nomic forces to preserve boundaries!
created by Versailles Treaty, prin
ciple obstacle to U.S. membership.
Three spheres ox influence, domi
nated by large nations, "league with
in a league" for recalcitrants, were
possibilities.
