We predict that the outstanding topcoat
of 1934 will be this
What a coat! The classic, English sort of thing that California women
take to their hearts and practically live in the year round. Casual in
its swagger, masculine lines (we styled it after the popular "Wrap
around" in out men's overcoat shop) with width a-plenty to hug youT
knees at a football game or snuggle into for a
long motor drive. Tailored of soft wool and silky
camel's hair. A perfect coat!

And the DOBBS "500" to wear with it...as classic and swagger
and smart as the "Wrap-around." In colors to matrh the
coat...or bright Stadium shades for contrast f . t • . #
