# MINNESOTA STUDENT REFUSES TO TAKE MILITARY TRAINING
## 
### 
The first authorized exemption
from compulsory military training
to a conscientious objector occurred
a few days ago at the University of
Minnesota.
Ray W. Ohlson, a liberal arts stu
dent and the son of a minister, was
forced to take the military course
along with all the other male stu
dents v.'ho enrolled at Minnesota.
After two weeks of wearing the uni
form, he fiatly refused to participate
further, saying that he did not want
to "give an outward show of ap
proval to a militaristic program."
He was immediately threatened
with expulsion, but wrote out his
case, submitted it to the college au
thorities, and was backed in his
opinion by many of thse members
of the faculty. The result was that
he was allowed to continue with his
education and not take the military
course.
His statement is as follows. "I can
go on with my education now. I
want some day to teach others how
to live—not how to kill. I believe
humanity's problems will never be
solved by treaties and disarmament
agreements, although they will.
"In the final analysis, the solution
is a simple one—absolute refusal of
all people to fight. If the youth of
the world would take this stand,
wars would be impossible because
the older warm-making men would
not' fight their own battles."
