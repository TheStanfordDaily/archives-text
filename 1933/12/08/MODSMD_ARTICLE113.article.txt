# YE EDIT AIRS A FEW PREJUDICES
## 
### 
It is our sincere opinion: that foot
ball coaches ought all to strictly
prohibit the reading of sports sec
tions by the players. And the same
holds true for all sports. Sports
writers write for the layman, not
for the edification or self-esteem of
Ihe athlete.
That all critics of Pop Warner
who enjoy stomping on a man's
face when be is down, ought to
go 'way back into the woods. The
"Old Man" knew bis business, and
bis worse fault may have been an
occasional burst of dour, honest
opinion.
If one can call the material thai
galloped around the varsity field in
1830, '31, and '32, the equal of what
we have out there now—well, that
one is no judge of football ability.
As if the .six sophomores starting
the game, and the four veterans of
1932 sitting on the bench in the Big
Game do not prove differently.
By choosing Columbia for the
Rose Bowl, the B.A.C. effectually
stopped this column's jeers. High
scholastic standing was announced
as one of the deciding factors, and
haven't we always advocated elim
inating thick sculls and thugs from
reputable school's schedules?
But nevertheless, we feel faint
upon reading: Columbia !>, Cor
nell 6; Michigan 40, Cornell 0;
Columbia 13, Virginia 7: Ohio
State 75. Virginia 0.
That the habit of elevating foot
ball coaches to heroism for winning
a couple of games, and deriding
ihem as bums for losing a couple,
is most deplorable, irrational, and
unsporting. "Scooter" Warburton
may have well slashed through for
another 43-yard touchdown in the
Trojan game; "Bones" Hamilton
might have been a split-second slow
in going after that now-famous pass.
And if so, where would jovial Coach
"Tiny" Thornhill be today? You
said it, brother. On the spot!
That our collegue, the estimable
Sylvestre Drofnats, may not be so
wrong after all. "Columbia in the
Rose Bowl! 'Tis a miscarriage of
justice," he proclaims. "I still
hold for Bluefield Teachers."
That the guys who figure out the
national football championships each
year must be tearing their hair at
this stage of the game. From the
Jon.'? distance it appears that Michi
gan will repeat.
That the football writers who
lounge in New York and feign a
critical knowledge of Pacific Coast
players when they pick their all-
Americans, are equalled for du
plicity only by the football
coaches on the Pacific Coast who
feign a complete ignorance about
their own teams—and earn good
money for publishing their "ba
loney."
That those who can spare a couple
of hours from disturbing term
papers might do well to saunter out
to the water polo tanks or the var
sity practice field now held down
by the rugby men, tomorrow after
noon. Interclass water polo and in-
Ira-squad rugby will be under way;
everything is free and the gals are
invited. —Hamilton

galloped around the varsity field in
1830, '31, and '32, the equal of what
we have out there now—well, that
one is no judge of football ability.
As if the .six sophomores starting
the game, and the four veterans of
1932 sitting on the bench in the Big
Game do not prove differently.
By choosing Columbia for the
Rose Bowl, the B.A.C. effectually
stopped this column's jeers. High
scholastic standing was announced
as one of the deciding factors, and
haven't we always advocated elim

reputable school's schedules?
But nevertheless, we feel faint
upon reading: Columbia !>, Cor

That the habit of elevating foot
ball coaches to heroism for winning
a couple of games, and deriding
ihem as bums for losing a couple,
is most deplorable, irrational, and
unsporting. "Scooter" Warburton
may have well slashed through for
another 43-yard touchdown in the
Trojan game; "Bones" Hamilton
might have been a split-second slow
in going after that now-famous pass.
And if so, where would jovial Coach
"Tiny" Thornhill be today? You
said it, brother. On the spot!
That our collegue, the estimable
Sylvestre Drofnats, may not be so
wrong after all. "Columbia in the
Rose Bowl! 'Tis a miscarriage of
justice," he proclaims. "I still
hold for Bluefield Teachers."
That the guys who figure out the
national football championships each
year must be tearing their hair at
this stage of the game. From the
Jon.'? distance it appears that Michi
gan will repeat.
That the football writers who
lounge in New York and feign a
critical knowledge of Pacific Coast
players when they pick their all-
Americans, are equalled for du
plicity only by the football
coaches on the Pacific Coast who
feign a complete ignorance about
their own teams—and earn good
money for publishing their "ba
loney."
That those who can spare a couple
of hours from disturbing term
papers might do well to saunter out
to the water polo tanks or the var
sity practice field now held down
by the rugby men, tomorrow after
noon. Interclass water polo and in-
Ira-squad rugby will be under way;
everything is free and the gals are
invited. —Hamilton
It is our sincere opinion: that foot
ball coaches ought all to strictly
prohibit the reading of sports sec
tions by the players. And the same
holds true for all sports. Sports
writers write for the layman, not
for the edification or self-esteem of
Ihe athlete.
That all critics of Pop Warner
who enjoy stomping on a man's
face when be is down, ought to
go 'way back into the woods. The
"Old Man" knew bis business, and
bis worse fault may have been an
occasional burst of dour, honest
opinion.
