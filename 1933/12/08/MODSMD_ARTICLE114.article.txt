# COLUMBIA SEEN AS FORMIDABLE GRIDIRON FOES
## 
### Charles Chappell 
With Conch Tinv Thornhill re
turning yesterday after a ten days'
vacation in Southern California,
one more voice was added to the
chorus of coaches who know and re
spect Lou Little, mentor of Colum
bia, and have high regard for his
ability to turn out capable football
teams.
When Thornhill was starring for
Pittsburgh back in 1910, Kittle was
playing considerable football for
the University of Pennsylvania so
that the two coaches' knowledge of
each other dates from lhat time.
After leaving Pennsylvania, Little
coached for several years at (Jcorge
town, l'rin where he went to Colum
bia.
1930 Saw Change
Columbia's modern football ren
naissauce began when Lou Little
took oyer the reigns in 1930. Since
then hte Lions have run up a record
of 2(> victories, seven defeats and
two ties. In 1931 Cornell handed
them their only defeat, the follow
ign year they lost only one game, to
Brown this time, and this season the
early-season defeat al the hands of
Princeton is the only blot on their
record.
Though somewhat shy on reserve
material Columbia boasts a fast, de
ceptive, smooth and well-drilled
outfit that eastern experts rate as
one of the strongest in that section
on the basis of its mid-season come
back and whirlwind finish. Captain
CI id" Montgomery, all-Eastern quar
terback, is the spark-plug of Ihc
Lion attack while Matal, at end, is
rated as one of the best Hank men
in the Last.
Stanford Favored
Despite whatever may be said, in
favor of Columbia, however, few
western grid fans will concede L9ll
Little's men much chance when
Stanford's big, powerful, and speedy
Indians swing into action 011 New
Year's Day. Plenty of justification
can be found for this belief, of
course. In the first place Columbia
has probably faced 110 such opposi
tion as the Trojans, Bears, Broncos,
and Bruins, all victims of the Stan
ford steamroller.
In the second place, few teams in
the country arc equipped with the
manpower that Coach Tiny Thorn
hill's squad includes. With a speedy
and beefy set of reserve backs and
linemen, Stanford will undoubtedly
have the advantage when the going
begins to get rough. The very fact
that Columbia will be the under
dog, however, will probably give the
Lions considerable of an incentive.
An overconfident Stanford team
might easily fall victim to a tired
lip Columbia outfit, determined to
beat the team that experts rate as
one of the most powerful in the
nation.
Stay in Pasadena
Practicing three times a week un
til the end of finals, the Indians
are scheduled to entrain for Pasa
dena 011 December 23. While in the
Tournament of Boscs city, they will
.stay at the Hotel Huntington and
work out in the Old Tournament
Park. Flitting back and forth be
tween Pasadena and Stanford, Al
Masters is expected back on the
campus again Saturday after being
away since Sunday.
Don Liebendorfer, director of pub
licity, left for the South last night
and will probably remain there un
til after the game.
So as to avoid any confusion,
Northwestern students must turn
in their photographs with their
work.
