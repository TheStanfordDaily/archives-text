# BABE HOOPSTERS VS. GOLDEN GATE J.C. SQUAD TODAY IN CARD SEASON OPENER
## 
### 
With an unknown five represent
ing the Golden Gate Junior College
of San Francisco for opposition,
Jimmy Bradshaw's frosh basketball
i team make their initial appearance
this afternoon at 5:30 o'clock in the
Encina gym. Although the game
promises only the usual quality of
an early season contest, basketball
| fans will be on hand to see how "the
finest material in years" acts under
| fire.
Two lanky forwards, each easily
six feet two inches, not only smooth

j floor men but also much more ver
satile in shooting than the average
| first year candidates, will come in
| for a good share of watching. Bill
i Quade and Howell Turner should
! give the Gaters' defense a busy af
i ternoon, if previous scrimmages
1 against the varsity are any criterion.
Centers Numerous
Ray Williamson and Dale Beedle,
from the forward wall of the '37 grid
j team, are due to share the pivot
1 post, with Williamson getting the
first call. Both are tall enough to
! give any opposing center a scrap for
. the tip-off, are bulky enough to
stand the knocks of the center court,
I but probably have not had football
; cleats off long enough to fit into the
I machine without friction.
Bradshaw's find is a midget guard,
Archie Zamloch, who earns a chuc
; kle every time he regularly bests
three or four taller opponents and
comes out of a scramble with the
leather which he dribbles so low
that opposing guards have a hard
time stopping his style of play.
Alongside Zamloch will be Dinty
, Moore, the fourth six-footer of the
five, who has enough shooting abil
i ity to make him valuable not only
in Stanford territory but also near
I the opposing bucket.
| In reserve will be Erlenheim,

1 Schott, and Randall, guards, while
Duncan and Huff should see service
■as forwards.
Although the official schedule has
1 not as yet received faculty approval,
the Stanford varsity has scheduled
; the following practice games for the
1933 season:
December 29 — San Jose State
Teachers College at San Jose.
December 30 —College of the Pa
cific at Stockton.
January 2—St. Mary's at Stanford,
t January s—Utah Aggies in San

Two lanky forwards, each easily
six feet two inches, not only smooth

j floor men but also much more ver

Centers Numerous
Ray Williamson and Dale Beedle,
from the forward wall of the '37 grid
j team, are due to share the pivot
1 post, with Williamson getting the
first call. Both are tall enough to
! give any opposing center a scrap for
. the tip-off, are bulky enough to
stand the knocks of the center court,
I but probably have not had football
; cleats off long enough to fit into the
I machine without friction.
Bradshaw's find is a midget guard,
Archie Zamloch, who earns a chuc
; kle every time he regularly bests
three or four taller opponents and
comes out of a scramble with the
leather which he dribbles so low
that opposing guards have a hard
time stopping his style of play.
Alongside Zamloch will be Dinty
, Moore, the fourth six-footer of the
five, who has enough shooting abil
i ity to make him valuable not only
in Stanford territory but also near
I the opposing bucket.
| In reserve will be Erlenheim,

1 Schott, and Randall, guards, while
Duncan and Huff should see service
■as forwards.
Although the official schedule has
1 not as yet received faculty approval,
the Stanford varsity has scheduled
; the following practice games for the

Teachers College at San Jose.
December 30 —College of the Pa

With an unknown five represent
ing the Golden Gate Junior College
of San Francisco for opposition,
Jimmy Bradshaw's frosh basketball
i team make their initial appearance
this afternoon at 5:30 o'clock in the
Encina gym. Although the game
promises only the usual quality of
an early season contest, basketball
| fans will be on hand to see how "the
finest material in years" acts under
| fire.
