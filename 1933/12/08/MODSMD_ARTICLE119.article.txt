# CARD POLO TEAM READY FOR BEARS ON HIGHWAY FIELD
## 
### Chuck Chappell 
Winding up their autumn' quarter
schedule, the Stanford poloists will
meet California's quartet of riders
this afternoon at 3 o'clock on the
Highway field in the second polo
game ever played between the two
universities.
Though polo has flourished for
some time at Stanford under the
auspices of the R.0.T.C., California,
not having a mounted reserve train
ing corps, was not able to muster
up a team until last year. Handi
capped by lack of mounts and in
experience, the Bear quartet was an
easy 10 to 2 victim of the Indians
last spring.'
Bears More Practiced
Aided by several months of ad
ditional practice and playing expe
rience, however, the Berkeley riders
are expected to be considerably im
proved. Though little information
is available about them, the Bears
are known to have beaten Santa
Cruz 7 to 0 in an earlier season
game.
Stanford's starting lineup will
consist of Captain Luppe Luppen at
number one, Bill Enemark at two,
Frank Burns at three, and Bill Rog
ers at back. Since the second string
team will probably see considerable
action, Woody Melone has been
shifted to it in order to balance up
the two quartets and to add a little
experience to the comparatively
green reserve four.
Enemark to Start
With Enemark moving to the
starting team, the second quartet
will include Cal Emeis, Kemp Maer,
Woody Melone, and Jim Henderson.
Unless California proves unexpect
edly strong these four will go in
shortly after the opening minutes.
Earlier games this quarter have
found Captain Gordan's charges
chalking up victories at the expense
of the Menlo Circus Club, the Del
Monte Polo Club, and the Castro
Valley team of the San Mateo Club.
Last week's tour to Tuscon resulted
in an 11 to 7 victory and a 12 to 8
loss out of two games with the Uni
versity of Arizona team.
Arizona to Come
With Captain Gordan well-satis
fied with the work of the team thus
far, games next quarter and in the
spring are expected to furnish fur
ther stiff tests for the Indians. Ari
zona will journey to the Fai-rn for
the second of the semi-annual se
ries between the two universities
sometime in February. Los Angeles
polo enthusiasts are also trying to
arrange an Arizona-Stanford series
in the southern city. If they succeed
the games will probably be played
sometime in January.
