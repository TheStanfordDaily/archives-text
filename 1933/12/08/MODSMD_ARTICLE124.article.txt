# Friend of Hart Flays Lynching in Editorial
## 
### 
Three days before the San Jose i
moJ> dealt out its retribution, an
editorial published in the weekly i
newspaper of the University of
Santa Clara, of which Hrooke Hart i
was an alumnus, pleaded that the |
law be permitted to take its course. |
The editorial, written by Rrongh
am J. Morris, editor of the student :
paper and friend of young Hart, ar- j
gued that it would he "a gross mis- i
â€¢carriage of justice to permit or par
ticipate in a lynching."
In the system of scholastic phi
losophy taught at the University of
Santa Clara, there is 110 justification j
ever for lynching.
