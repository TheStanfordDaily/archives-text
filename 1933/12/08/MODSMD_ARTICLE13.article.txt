I many different programs of Saveli
I Walevitch has brought him before
j audiences of all types and ages
; throughout the United States and
Europe.
Russian Folk Songs
The ancient folk songs of Russia
| are of great significance in that they
j represent the life and customs of the
j people and are spontaneous, authen
i tic creations in artistic form.
! The extent of the influence of the
| folk song on modern Russian music
j is perceptible as far back as the
j 1860's, when that highly gifted cir-
I cle of musicians known as the
"Mighty Five" was formed. This
; brilliant group included Balakureff,
j Cui, Moussorgsky, Borodin, and
! Rimsky-Korsakoff.
Many Appearances
Saveli Walevitch figures first
fsmong the Russians who have intro
duced to America these old Russian
I folk songs and Gypsy Ballads. With
him it is a work of devotion, in
j order to preserve this primitive art,
j which, with the growth of western
culture is rapidly vanishing, even in
| Russia itself.
Among his many appearances are:
1 Twice at the Sorbonne, introduced
Iby Anatole France and again by
! Alfred Corot — with Jean Jacques
j Copeau at the Theatre du Vieux
j Columbier in Paris and New York—
! Lausanne 1931 Anglo-American Mu-
I sic Education Conference—Theatre
! Guild's '"Power of Darkness"—many
! clubs, concert series in universities
j and colleges, including Vassar,
Smith, Barnard, Wells, Columbia,
j Boston, Chicago, and many private
! schools.
j This will be the concluding pro
j gram of the Tuesday Evening Series
j for this quainter.
