# TEMPLETON, ELLINGTON TO WATCH ROW, CLUBS COMPETE FOR TRACK, FIELD HONORS
## 
### MILLARD BROWNE 
Breakers, El Toro, and Dekes will
continue their attempt to settle in
tramural track supremacy, and nu
merous other eating clubs, fraterni
ties will try to break into the front
line as the cinder path and field
branch of mural athletics gets under
way this afternoon at 3:30 o'clock.
Breakers Won in 1932
Last year's meet was won by the
Breakers, many of which now boast
track letters. Toro and D.K.E. bat
tled for second position, and either,
or neither, may beat the defenders
today.
Marvie Kahn, intramural man
ager, said eligibility rules will be
the same as for other inter-organi
zation athletics. All track letter
men will be barred.
All regular track events, from
sprints to two-mile, and the full
program of field events will be run
off.

For varsity, freshman track can
didates, the intra-mural contest will
take the place of the regular Fri
day meet. Unaffiliated frosh will
compete for their respective Encina
floors.
Look for Stars
..Coaches Dink Templeton and Bill
Ellington will watch performances
of regular team members; the men
tors also will have their eyes open
for possible stars. History says large
numbers of these, too bashful to
contend for varsity positions, report
annually for the honor of their house
01 hall.
Winners of each event will collect
the customary five points, with the
other four places counting 4, 3, 2,
and 1 points, respectively.
Trial heats may be held in over
crowded events. If the meet is not
completed today, it will be finished
Monday, Kahn said.
