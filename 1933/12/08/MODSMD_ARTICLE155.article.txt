CRADLE SONG (Paramount)
At the Columbia Theatre
Paramount chose an excellent ve- j
hide for the American debut of i
Dorothea Wieck, following her phe- I
nomenal success in the German- i
language film, "Maedchen in Uni
form."
This Mark Connolly adaptation of j
the Martinez Serra play tells a j
strikingly simple story: a young girl,
1 despite a great desire for mother
hood, enters a convent, where chance
permits her to care for a foundling j
whom the sisters name Theresa. The
girl grows to womanhood under the
loving care of Sister Joanna, and I
reaches the point where she is ready |
for sisterhood or marriage. And it j
is at this point that the film reaches I
| its most compelling heights—when
Sister Joanna realizes that this child
for whom she has cared so long is
to leave her.
The story is given a beautiful set- i
ting, the photography is splendid, !
; and the musical score is the best j
j since "Song of Songs."
Yet with all its assets —and they j
are many—the film fails to move j
one as it should. This, I believe, is j
, largely the fault of the director, j
Mitchell Leisen, who failed at the i
outset to establish sufficiently the |
sympathetic nature of the leading
i character, rather smothering her first
amidst countless people, and later
among hooded nuns, endless clois
ters, and numerous Ave Marias.
Dorothea Wieck is distinctly im- j
1 pressive in the role of Joanna, and j
it is evident lhat she will go far in I
American pictures if given careful!
direction and intelligent stories. I
She infuses her characterization j
with all the ethereal beauty and I
tender charm that one expects of j
her, and captures much of the tragic :
depth of the story. She ages with i
infinite skill—not with lines and
tricks of make-up, but with voice,
I gesture, and creation of mood.
Louise Dresser is excellent as the j
Prioress, playing the role with J
charm and restraint. Sir Guy Stand- I
ing is charming in the rather su- j
perfluous part of Don Jose, and j
Evelyn Venable is an adequate |
Theresa. —Chapin I
