# Liquor Stand Explained by City Attorney
## Officials Not Concerned With Ethical Issue 
### Jay Graves 
Following his recent reversal of
stand regarding the legality of
sale of 3.2 beer and wine in Palo
Alto, City Attorney Arnold Runi
well last night clarified his posi
tion in a special interview granted
the Daily. Rumwell. although ill
in bed, made the following ex
planation.
"Many people have misconstrued
the position taken by Palo Alto city
officials," he declared. "They seem
to feel that those of us who are
seeking the truth of the tangle re
garding the sale of beer are delib
erately trying to keep beer out of
Palo Alto.
Ethical Issue
"This is not the case. We are not
concerned with the ethical issue one
way or the other. I am only inter
ested in determining what the ex
isting laws of the situation are and
following them. If the matter is fi
nally clarified, then nobody will
have any complaints."
Runjwell pointed out that this was
the reason back of the test case in
stituted yesterday by Police Chief
H. A. Zink against Al Mesa, opera
tor of a smoke shop in Mayfield.
Police in Quandary
According to Zink, Mesa has al
legedly been selling beer for quite
some time, and the Palo Alto police,
in more or less of a quandary up to
the present, have decided to act and,
if possible, determine where they
stand.
Mesa pleaded "not guilty" to vio
lation of the Palo Alto city ordi
nance prohibiting the sale of alco
holic drinks. Rumwell said that the
esse would come up for hearing in
Police Court next Monday.
He pointed out that in all prob
ability it would not be settled
there, but that the decision would
be appealed to the Superior Court.
Summing up the question he ex
plained: "It is a question of fact
whether or not this beer is intoxi
cating. If it is not intoxicating, the
Palo Alto ordinance does not operate
and the deed clause regarding re
version of property to the Univer
sity is the only factor barring the
sale of beer."
He added that it was possible
that the Palo Alto ordinance
might be wiped out in court de
cision anyway.
"This unique tangle between the
words 'intoxicating' and 'alcoholic'
has always existed. It leaves a loop
hole in the state law inasmuch as
it says nothing concerning the con
trol of non-intoxicating, - alcoholic
beverage. While studying the situ
ation further, I discovered it and the
logic of the case seems to indicate
that beer cannot be sold.
"I think the best thing is to go
through the test cases and to thrash
the thing out in the courts. Then
we will see whether the ordinance
holds."

has always existed. It leaves a loop
hole in the state law inasmuch as
it says nothing concerning the con
trol of non-intoxicating, - alcoholic
beverage. While studying the situ
ation further, I discovered it and the
logic of the case seems to indicate
that beer cannot be sold.
"I think the best thing is to go
through the test cases and to thrash
the thing out in the courts. Then
we will see whether the ordinance
holds."
Following his recent reversal of
stand regarding the legality of
sale of 3.2 beer and wine in Palo
Alto, City Attorney Arnold Runi
well last night clarified his posi
tion in a special interview granted
the Daily. Rumwell. although ill
in bed, made the following ex
planation.
"Many people have misconstrued
the position taken by Palo Alto city
officials," he declared. "They seem
to feel that those of us who are
seeking the truth of the tangle re
garding the sale of beer are delib
erately trying to keep beer out of
Palo Alto.
Ethical Issue
"This is not the case. We are not
concerned with the ethical issue one
way or the other. I am only inter
ested in determining what the ex
isting laws of the situation are and
following them. If the matter is fi
nally clarified, then nobody will
have any complaints."
Runjwell pointed out that this was
the reason back of the test case in
stituted yesterday by Police Chief
H. A. Zink against Al Mesa, opera
tor of a smoke shop in Mayfield.
Police in Quandary
According to Zink, Mesa has al
legedly been selling beer for quite
some time, and the Palo Alto police,
in more or less of a quandary up to
the present, have decided to act and,
if possible, determine where they
stand.
Mesa pleaded "not guilty" to vio
lation of the Palo Alto city ordi
nance prohibiting the sale of alco
holic drinks. Rumwell said that the
esse would come up for hearing in
Police Court next Monday.
He pointed out that in all prob
ability it would not be settled
there, but that the decision would
be appealed to the Superior Court.
Summing up the question he ex
plained: "It is a question of fact
whether or not this beer is intoxi
cating. If it is not intoxicating, the
Palo Alto ordinance does not operate
and the deed clause regarding re
version of property to the Univer
sity is the only factor barring the
sale of beer."
He added that it was possible
that the Palo Alto ordinance
might be wiped out in court de
cision anyway.
"This unique tangle between the
words 'intoxicating' and 'alcoholic'
has always existed. It leaves a loop
hole in the state law inasmuch as
it says nothing concerning the con
trol of non-intoxicating, - alcoholic
beverage. While studying the situ
ation further, I discovered it and the
