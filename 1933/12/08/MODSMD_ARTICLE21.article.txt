# Wisconsin Senior Hangs On Second-Story Ledge
## 
### 
A University of Wisconsin senior
hung perilously by his hands the
other day from the second-story
ledge of the University co-op house.
A $1.50 bet had tempted him to try
walking the ledge, but halfway
across he slipped and dangled in the
air.
Residents of the house came home
and found him hanging from the
high ledge unable to move either
up or down. His screams attracted
scores of people who ofTered him
much advice but no assistance. The
fire department's hook and ladder
contingent finally saved the day and
pulled the pale youth down.
