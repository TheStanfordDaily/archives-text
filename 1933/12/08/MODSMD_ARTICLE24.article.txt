# DRAMA READING STARS SANDOE
## Richard II Ends Season For Sword and Sandals 
### Grant Hopewell 
The reading of Shakespeare's
Richard II has been Sword and San
dals' most ambitious production, and
its success leads us to hope that its
plan to produce older, less popular
plays will continue. If any word of
advice is to be given, it is that the
reading of a verse play, in language
not too familiar, takes a good deal
of rehearsal.
Most of the principals knew how
to read verse, but the unfamiliarity
of the material caused many un
steady, jerky bits. James Sandoe,
in the role of Richard, was not seri
ously hampered by this, and gave
one of his buest characterizations
thus far.
Sandoe Impressive
His interpretation of the role was
decidedly lyrical, and he showed a
tendency to exalt the character in
the earlier acts to a greater extent
than the lines called for. But the
important scenes for Richard tome
in the last three acts, and here San
doe, having overcome his hesitancy,
played the part to its full poten
tialities. Especially good were his
third act scenes, with their frequent
changes of mood and high lyric
heights.
The rest of the cast did not quite
reach Sandoe's level, but then had
parts that did not admit of nearly
as much development. William
Gwinn as Bolingbroke played ir
regularly, occasionally failing to
grasp the full possibility of his
lines. Paul Crary as the Duke of
York might have done more with
this unimportant but difficult part.
Knapp, Brauns Good
William Knapp as Northumber
land and Robert Brauns as Mowbray
did excellent work, and seemed
more sure of themselves than the
rest of the cast. James Broughton
as John of Gaunt had only one im
portant scene, in which he had some
difficulty in reconciling his charac
ter to the poetic quality of his lines.
Myna Hughes, George Leavens,
Robert Dwan, and Robert Balzer
might be singled out for special
mention among the minor charac
ters.
James Sandoe's direction gave the
play a slow tempo that might have
been varied to advantage occasion
ally. The mood of the play is minor
throughout, but there are subtle
variations that could have been ob
tained. But after all, the play is
almost entirely in the character of
Richard, and Sandoe's work here
assured the excellence of the play.

rest of the cast. James Broughton
as John of Gaunt had only one im
portant scene, in which he had some
difficulty in reconciling his charac
ter to the poetic quality of his lines.
Myna Hughes, George Leavens,
Robert Dwan, and Robert Balzer
might be singled out for special
mention among the minor charac
ters.
James Sandoe's direction gave the
play a slow tempo that might have
been varied to advantage occasion
ally. The mood of the play is minor
throughout, but there are subtle
variations that could have been ob
tained. But after all, the play is
almost entirely in the character of
Richard, and Sandoe's work here
assured the excellence of the play.
The reading of Shakespeare's
Richard II has been Sword and San
dals' most ambitious production, and
its success leads us to hope that its
plan to produce older, less popular
plays will continue. If any word of
advice is to be given, it is that the
reading of a verse play, in language
not too familiar, takes a good deal
of rehearsal.
Most of the principals knew how
to read verse, but the unfamiliarity
of the material caused many un
steady, jerky bits. James Sandoe,
in the role of Richard, was not seri
ously hampered by this, and gave
one of his buest characterizations
thus far.
Sandoe Impressive
His interpretation of the role was
decidedly lyrical, and he showed a
tendency to exalt the character in
the earlier acts to a greater extent
than the lines called for. But the
important scenes for Richard tome
in the last three acts, and here San
doe, having overcome his hesitancy,
played the part to its full poten
tialities. Especially good were his
third act scenes, with their frequent
changes of mood and high lyric
heights.
The rest of the cast did not quite
reach Sandoe's level, but then had
parts that did not admit of nearly
as much development. William
Gwinn as Bolingbroke played ir
regularly, occasionally failing to
grasp the full possibility of his
lines. Paul Crary as the Duke of
York might have done more with
this unimportant but difficult part.
Knapp, Brauns Good
William Knapp as Northumber
land and Robert Brauns as Mowbray
did excellent work, and seemed
more sure of themselves than the
rest of the cast. James Broughton
as John of Gaunt had only one im
portant scene, in which he had some
difficulty in reconciling his charac
ter to the poetic quality of his lines.
Myna Hughes, George Leavens,
