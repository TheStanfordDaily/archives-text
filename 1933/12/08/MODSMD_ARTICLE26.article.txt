# Bawl-Out May Go; Registrar Still Thinking
## Mitchell Says Change Next Quarter Is Unlikely 
### 
By Annalec Whitinore
The Bawl-out may, perhaps, go,
iin the opinion advanced last night
by Registrar J. P. Mitchell. "The
1 matter has not as yet been given
j serious consideration. No personal
| word has come to me regarding the
revision"—which is not contemplated
; for the coming quarter at least, if
| his comments are a final criterion.
"The question, I think, has been
] exaggerated," he accuses. "It is not,
at any rate, a matter for majority
1 vote."
Approves Publication
i Admitting that he had glanced at
; yesterday's statements by Dean Cul
! ver refuting Bawl-out value, Mitcli
! ell agrees in that he does not con
sider publication of grade points an
appreciable incentive to scholarship.
He believes, however, that argu
! ments in favor of the volume out
! weigh criticism advanced by its op-
I ponents.
Would elimination of the much
publicized column increase the num
ber of students on independent
.study? "No," he decided. "It prob
j ably would not affect it in the least."
News from the East, where Presi
| dent Wilbur travels at present, re
| mains unreceived. His arrival may
advance an entirely different view
' point.
Grades Not Affected
"I do not credit the claim that
professors rely on the Bawl-out rat
-1 ings when grading," the Registrar
stated firmly. "I think the state- j
; ment unfounded."
As to what might bo substituted.;
Jin place of the offending grade
status, Mitchell inferred that no se
rious consideration had been given
; the matter. Phone numbers, he
; thinks, would perhaps be a good
idea—if grade points were not listed.
Replying to the Daily-advanced
'suggestion that phone numbers or
| addresses replace grades for one
i quarter, as a trial period, he refused
Ito comment. "It would be a subject
for serious thought, which I have
! not as yet given."
Cites Advantage
The principal advantage of the
1 Bawl-out as it now exists, he be
lieved, is the readiness with which
sororities, fraternities, and other or
ganizations may discover the schol
,astic status of an individual. What
system might be substituted with
with elimination of the present
method, he does not know. It would
require initiation of an entire new
system of records.
"I don't remember any previous
serious discussion of eliminating the
ratings," said he, after considera-"
tion. He intimated, however, that if
sufficient pressure were applied,
Bawl-out revision would be entirely
possible.
