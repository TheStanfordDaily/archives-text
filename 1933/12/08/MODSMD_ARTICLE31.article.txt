# Gaels Favored to Beat Small S.M.U. Squad
## 
### 
Outweighing their opponents by
I 20 pounds to the man and boasting
lof a record much superior, St.
; Mary's College is expected to walk
over Southern Methodist University
when the teams stage their second
intersections! football game tomor
j row afternoon in San Francisco.
Slip Madigan's Gaels, who recent
i ly were removed from the Santa
; Clara schedule, barely a week after
similar action supposedly was taken
by Stanford authorities, have suf
fered setbacks this year at the hands
of California, Southern California,
and Oregon. The Texas team has
copepd but one game this season.
Despite the poor showing that the
Mustangs have made, they are hop
ing to uncork a passing attack which
will score them a victory and bring
j some cheers in their last game of
I the year.
