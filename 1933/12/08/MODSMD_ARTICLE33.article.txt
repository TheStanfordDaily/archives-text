# J. P. Mitchell Will Think It Over
## 
### 
The Registrar has not yet fully considered the liawl-
Oul question. We I rust he will give it serious consideration
during the happy Christmas days that arc coming.*
Maybe, he will have thought the matter out when we
re I urn. We hope so.
Merry Christmas, Registrar. Perhaps you will grant a
happier New Year for the student body by dragging out
the Bawl-Out.
