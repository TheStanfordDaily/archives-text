# BULL SESSION
## WAKE UP OR DIE RIGHT NOW 
### 
| The campus is just beginning to
i realize that there is such an organi
| zation as Cap and Gown. In the
■ smug comfort of their satorial title,
| the sisters have slumbered despite
j the heavy rumbling of campus prob
: lems. These problems the tidy or
! ganization made no real attempt to
j solve, so at last Cap and Gowners
I have added to the general melee by
I themselves becoming a problem.
1
The noble triumvirate who had
j the courage to withdraw from their
1 rapidly atrophying lodge should be
j honored for two very definite rea
j sons.
I First, they have displayed a rarity
j in life, on campus and off, VISCE
| RAL DYNAMICS, more picture::-
1 quely and prosaically referred to as
! guts. In the face of tears, moans,
I and shouts, they walked out on
I what to most of Ihe "800" (and to
j the. "500'ers" who have passed on to
I the limbo of graduation) appears as
i the crowning glory of a collegiate
! career. They did this not with child
i ish impulsiveness. Only when sound
J argument fell before the onslaught
i of burblings from the beyond, only
'when the voice of tradition-ridden
! alumnae had refused to respond to
reason—did the evacuation occur.
That is to be commended.
I Equally significant is, or should be,
I the fundamental cause of the deser
• tion. Millard, Dear, and Morris got
! out because to remain longer in
arthritis-stricken Cap and Gown was
to stand in the House of Death—a
repellent dwelling to any mentally
alive individual. By showing their
! disgust for mere "honor," the trio of
! Stanford women have pointed the
' condemning finger at every honorary
j society on the campus that has
(ceased to function in honorary fash
! ion—if indeed it functions at all'.
Regardless of whether or not the
"automatic" system of Cap and
! Gown election is a feasible plan, the
i basic thesis remains that an hon
j orary society should be an activity
1 and not a morgue. Napoleon rec
! ognized that men would do anything

for a bit of ribbon. The cattish
councils of women "leaders" have
done almost anything to secure
membership in Cap and Gown. But
strangely the feverish activity which
has gone into the grabbing off of
memberships in the mortar board
sanctorum has ceased with the ac
quisition of the society's plan. This,
however, is not a phenomenon lim
ited to the Senior Women's hon
orary.
Merely to heap honorary titles on
the heads of women already hon
ored by office and the like, seems
somewhat of a redundancy. Unless
election into an honorary serves
some worthy purpose, the formality
is not justified. An honorary so
ciety without a purpose is like a
man in a penitentiary: no place to
go, nothing to do.
If conditions remain as they are,
it is quite apparent that the exit
trek started by Millard, Dear, and
Morris should become a grand
march. Honoraries must wake up
and do something, or content them
selves with extinction.
