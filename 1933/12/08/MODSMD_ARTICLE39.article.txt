# WHO ARE YOU TRYING TO BAWL-OUT, FATHER?
## 
### 
The relations between me and my family are all out
Because unfortunately they got hold of a Bawl-out.
Now, up to this time we got along line—
And while I was gone my father would mail me letters
Sending me money to pay all my debtors;
And when I came home for vacation
There was a general celebration.
And it was firmly embedded in, my dome
That I was very welcome at home.
BUT NOW
I am only a poor cast out
All on account of the Bawl-out.
When I conu> home to celebrate
And I'm treated like a renegade,
And in place of the welcome cry
I'm greeted with an evil eye.
At the dinner table I only hear growls
And the only looks I recover are scowls.
YET
For two years ine and my family were the best of friends
And apparently our relations would never ends,
But since the day my father read the Ball-ouse
I have been deep in the dog-house.
And I don't mind letting you know
That either I, oil the BALL-OUT MUST GO!
