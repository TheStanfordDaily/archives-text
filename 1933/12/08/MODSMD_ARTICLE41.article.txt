# Red Snubs Nazis

### 
Astute, rotund Soviet LitvinofT
spent a whole day in Berlin, stu
| diously avoided contacting anti
j Red, Nazi government. All this in
! spite of much wooing by servile
j German press. Some thought diplo
i mat's visit to Rome augured well
| lor Russo-German rapprochement
| via Mussolini. They were wrong.
I Even Nazi Rosenberg (not Jewish,
j but 99.44 per cent Aryan) urged that
I by-gones be by-gones. LitvinofT left
i for Moscow, turning the t:old shoul
j der.
