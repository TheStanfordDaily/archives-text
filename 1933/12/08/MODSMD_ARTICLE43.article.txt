Senator Reed yesterday in a talk
I in Philadelphia told how he stands.
Money: he's in favor of a stabilized
dollar; is afraid that Congress on a
vote would favor inflation but hopes
the President will resist this move
ment.
NRA: he thinks that the function
of this Act has served its purpose,
that the south will be "devastated"
iby its continuance; that this Act
! was at the expense of "small busi
nessmen" causing them to run at a
I loss.
