## COUNTER REACTION, COUNTER REACTION. 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Now that Prohibition has been
both passed (1919), and repealed
(1933), there will come the counter
reaction; another A1 Capone, an or
ganized racketeering body, unknown
terrors, and a new kind of a com
bination speakeasy-saloon.
The same people who yelled their
lungs out for prohibition in 1919,
and then talked it down in 1930,
will yell their lungs out for it again
in 1940.
This will be the Counter-Reac

'tion, and of cource all the counter
counter - reaction - reformers will
; scream and say that prohibition will
save the country and put it back on
its feet.
And then will come the counter
counter-reaction and only repeal
will save the country, etc., etc., etc.,
.so, with all these reactions and re
peals and historical repeatings, let
us not place too much importance on
[ the 1933 reaction.
There are plenty more to follow.
