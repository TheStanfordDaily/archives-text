# PRAISES WITH FAINT DAMNING

, The Editor, Sir:
Enough of this simple Bawl-Out
Business. Why step on a worm?
One must, of course, admit that
publishing the grade-point standings
, of Students is useless, irrelevant,
j and concerns no one save the par
ticular student and the administra
tion. But Mr. Editor, what of it?
j The only logical reform is to scrap
the grade system,' that useless, un
(intelligent Business which causes us
I merely to cram, lose sleep. This
"liberal" University is again in the

, back ranks whereas Cal, Chicago,
and other universities which stress
learning rather than listening, bon
ing, have begun to swing into line
behind the European Institutions
where grade-point follies are un
known, where we hear Students ac
tually become interested in what is
going on, can talk intelligently, act
in the same manner without being
compelled to attend lectures, or be
ing marked on their relative com
placency.
Ah well, it's a blight world.
