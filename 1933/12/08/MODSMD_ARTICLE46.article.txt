# HO HUM—ANOTHER LETTER
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Is no one enough interested in
your "Bawl-Out "controversy" even
to bother arguing with you?
i
Why all the fuss about to publish
,or not to publish? Good or not,
grades ARE, and it is my opinion
i that the publicizing of them is not
i so misleading or so expository or so
| morbidly interesting as you would

have us believe.
Like the Daily, I am in favor of
reform, even of agitation, when the
end justifies the fuss. But. I—and
many are of the same mind—fail to
see the GREAT BENEFIT in your
proposed amendment.
I shall omit the reasons for my be
lief. They would be no more inter
| esting than your campaign. Ho hum.
