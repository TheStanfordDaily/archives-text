Following in F.R.'s wake, Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union caught up
with nationally infamous San Jose
lynching. Bombastic mouthpiece
Wirin is going to do something
about it, he says. How: has names
of culprits, demands red-baiting
district attorney act; if he fails, Wi
rin will put it up to the state; fail
ing here, to U.S. Attorney-General
Cummings. F.R. started something.
