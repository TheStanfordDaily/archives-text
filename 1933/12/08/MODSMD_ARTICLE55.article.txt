# Student Body Will Not Back Book Exchange
## 
### 
The proposal for the establish
i inent of a text-book exchange by
the A.S.S.U. was turned down by
I the Ex. Committee in their last
j meeting.
Measons given by Ex-coinmittee
j men were: they don't feel it would
I bring enough return to students
I (who would manage it) to pay them
1 for the labor; it would cause the
! A.S.S.U. to subsidize an activity, the
money for which could be better
used elsewhere; and the book-mart
j would conflict with existing facili
j ties for book-exchange.
