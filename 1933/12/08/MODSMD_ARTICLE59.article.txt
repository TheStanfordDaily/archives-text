Said he, a college gentleman, to
she, a co-ed: "What say we pour
honey?"
Said she to he: "And what makes
you think I want to snoogle with
you, you dope? Are you wooky. or
have you tied one on?"
"Yeah, if I was Oscar Glutch ev
erything would be oke, wouldn't it?
But if that's the way it is I'll scram
as I don't want to cop a phinney."
Hot Palter
And so on far into the night could
go this sample of college education
across the United States. This and
much more of the hottest collegiate
patter has been collected in nation
wide survey among 100 university
now being brought to a close by
Wilfred J. Funk, publisher and poet.
"More slang is being coined on
college campuses now than ever be
fore," Funk said. "Collegians exist
on vocabularies pi 125 or 200 words

I and have reduced life to a few brief,
but potent mutterings."
Stanford's main contribution to
the mutterings that Funk has col
lected is "ding," which he defines as
meaning a blackball or in the verbal
form, to blackball.
Read 'em
Pour honey? It means make love;
j snoogle is petting; wooky, mentally
unbalanced; tied one on, slightly in
toxicated; to cop a phinney, to steal
1 another* man's girl. Or at least this
j is the way publisher Funk explains
| the chatter of Eastern collegians.
At Cornell, a doose is a very fast
driver, or a very fast anything. A
! smoutch is a cavalier to the ladies
at Amherst, while at Temple Uni
j versity a 22 is a low caliber date,
and an ostrich is a dollar bill. And
a lily,' at Purdue, is a great fellow
with the women or the same as a
I Stanford smoothie.
