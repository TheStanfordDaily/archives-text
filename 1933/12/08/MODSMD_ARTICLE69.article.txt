# AUTUMN FINALS TO TEST VALUE OF HONOR CODE
## Stanford System on Trial Because of Increase In Enrollment 
### 
One of the few universities which
has successfully maintained an
Honor Code, Stanford puts it Honor .
Code record to its first big trial of
(his year with the approaching au
tumn quarter finals.
Trying to acquaint new student.® ,
with the workings of the Code, Ernie
Arbuckle, chairman of Men's Coun- j
eil, and Barbara Binns, acting chair- !
man of Women's Council, urge stu- j
dent co-operation and adherence to j
the Code necessary for its continu- j
a nee.
Avoid Suspicion
As an aid to enforcing the Code |
i! is suggested to the students by ;
Honor Code supporters that they!
conduct themselves in a manner j
which will avert all suspicion. Tak- i
ing books into the examination, j
taking blue books from the room, j
loitering in groups outside the room
during the examination, are all ac
tions which might encourage non
violators to become violators for the j
reason that other students might J
think they are being taken advan- \
tage of.
Arbuckle says: '"You,.the students,)
must enforce your own Honor Code.
The councils do not try to police it.
You can maintain your Code by
calling attention to violators during j
the examination, by speaking to;
them when you see them overstep- '
ping the bounds; or if you think the j
cheating is flagrant throughout the j
class, it is your duty to speak to the j
professor, who can immediately I
check it."
Penalty for Violation
Chairman Barbara Binns believes I
in the Code. She says: "The Honor
Code is a success. If, because of |
your experiences in examinations,
you feel it is not, you are partially
to blame for what you deem its
failure. You, as an individual stu
dent, must assume a certain respon
sibility for its enforcement."
Pointing out the influence of older
students upon the new, both chair
men urge adherence and co-opera-j
tion of old sons of the Stanford Red.
As an added attraction for obeying
(he Code, violation results in sus
pensions for the University; failure
1o report a violation subjects a stu
dent to honorary probation. Students
should acquaint themselves with the
provisions of the Honor Code, since
ignorance will be no excuse for vio
lators.

One of the few universities which
has successfully maintained an
Honor Code, Stanford puts it Honor .
Code record to its first big trial of
(his year with the approaching au
tumn quarter finals.
Trying to acquaint new student.® ,
with the workings of the Code, Ernie
Arbuckle, chairman of Men's Coun- j
eil, and Barbara Binns, acting chair- !
man of Women's Council, urge stu- j
dent co-operation and adherence to j
the Code necessary for its continu- j
a nee.
Avoid Suspicion
As an aid to enforcing the Code |
i! is suggested to the students by ;
Honor Code supporters that they!
conduct themselves in a manner j
which will avert all suspicion. Tak- i
ing books into the examination, j
taking blue books from the room, j
loitering in groups outside the room
during the examination, are all ac
tions which might encourage non
violators to become violators for the j
reason that other students might J
think they are being taken advan- \
tage of.
Arbuckle says: '"You,.the students,)
must enforce your own Honor Code.
The councils do not try to police it.
You can maintain your Code by
calling attention to violators during j
the examination, by speaking to;
them when you see them overstep- '
ping the bounds; or if you think the j
cheating is flagrant throughout the j
class, it is your duty to speak to the j
professor, who can immediately I
check it."
Penalty for Violation
Chairman Barbara Binns believes I
in the Code. She says: "The Honor
Code is a success. If, because of |
your experiences in examinations,
you feel it is not, you are partially
to blame for what you deem its
failure. You, as an individual stu
dent, must assume a certain respon
sibility for its enforcement."
Pointing out the influence of older
students upon the new, both chair
men urge adherence and co-opera-j
tion of old sons of the Stanford Red.
As an added attraction for obeying
(he Code, violation results in sus
pensions for the University; failure
1o report a violation subjects a stu
dent to honorary probation. Students
should acquaint themselves with the
provisions of the Honor Code, since
ignorance will be no excuse for vio
lators.
