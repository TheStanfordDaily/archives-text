# 5125 GALLONS MAKE HUGE RIVER OF MILK WHICH FLOWS THROUGH ENCINA COMMONS

No NRA code for students —45
hours a week, plus jobs—where do
they get the energy?
Some inklings of an answer to the
problem may be gleaned from a
perusal of the records of food con
sumed at the Encina Commons.
The most striking item is the
river of milk that flows —well, where
it does the most good. In the two
months of October and November,
5,125 gallons went down the hatch
—that much gasoline would drive a
ten-ton truck six times around the
world. To oil up the motor, there
were (>O2 gallons of cream; and to
grease the axles, 559 gallons of ice
cream. The Motor Boys at Stan
ford!
What a whale of a time the En
cina roughs (and sponsors) would
have if they got hold of 2,760 dozen

( eggs at once, rather than over a
protracted period of two months.
But the clean-and-press boys would
win in the end.
Bread is still the staff of life —
the Commons has disposed of some
12,000 dozen rolls and an equally
astounding total of loaves of bread,
topped off with 4,234 pounds of but
ter, 138 gallons of jam, and 20 gal
lons of honey.
Balanced diet calls for use of 372
dozen heads of lettuce—a salad fit
for a King—Kong.
But with all this capacity, the old
days of a gulp, a crunch, and a dash
are over; Encina roughs take their
time with their food, and it appears
that the old record of 15 minutes
between the first arrival and the last
departure will not even be threat
ened. And that's how energetic
j denizens of Encina get that way.
