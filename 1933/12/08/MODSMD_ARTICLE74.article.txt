# Abolition of Referendum Indicated by U.C. Council
## 
### 
Indications that the referendum
may be abolished rather than limited
in the new A.S.U.C. constitution,
now in process of formation at the
University of California, have arisen
following conferences among mem
bers of the welfare council, in
charge of the constitutional revi
sion.
Members of the council agreed
that only A.S.U.C. card-holders will
be allowed to participate in the
election of student body and class
officers, inasmuch as the financial
activity of the A.S.U.C. is dependent
upon the opinions of these officials.
