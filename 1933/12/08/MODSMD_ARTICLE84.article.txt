# 'MERRY CHRISTMAS' ONLY NAME TO MANY NEEDY FAMILIES IN STANFORD'S VICINITY
## 
### FRANCES AYRES 
There are nine children in the
family. Nine, thin, undernourished
little mites who judge happiness in
the uncertain terms of getting
enough to eat. Their father has been
unemployed since the rock quarry
closed, their mother, despite fast
failing health, works two days a
week at a laundry. The county pays
them $11 a week. They exist —il
really isn't living — in a shack
scarcely a mile from the campus,
A Merry Christmas—the children
of this family and of dozens like U
scarcely know what the words mean.
If they had a Christmas tree they
would probably burn it to keep
warm. Mention Christmas presents
to them and they say, "Well, per
haps Mother will make us some
cookies."
Imagine having five little children,
a discouraged, sick husband and
only the money you could earn at

the Palo Alto Service League to
support them all. That is the Christ
mas one Mayfield woman faces. A
worse prospect is in store for the
harassed father of four motherless
babies who can scarcely earn enough
to feed them, let alone buy them
Christmas presents.
These families are not exceptions,
but merely typical of the human
want and suffering that is found in
the neighborhood of Stanford.
So very little would help to make
this a Merry Christmas for some of
the unfortunate children and their
pitifully brave mothers and fathers.
The Palo Alto Service League, the
Shelter, and the Community House
know how to reach those that need
assistance. They know of the pov
i erty that is bare, not concealed in
houses that lie close to Stanford,
and urge that students do their part
i in helping.
