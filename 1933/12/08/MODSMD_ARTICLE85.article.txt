# VARIETY OF CONGRATULATORY MESSAGES RECEIVED BY STANFORD RADIO DEBATERS
## 
### Helen Ottenheimer 
Copious, congratulatory, have
I been the messages received by radio
1 forensic stars Dick von Wagenen
and Bill Rogers on their convincing
presentation of the negative stand
in the November 18th debate with
Cambridge on "Resolved: that Dem
ocracy rather than a Dictatorship is
the way out of our present dilem
ma."
From people of both side - of the
I big pond are coming missives prais
j ing the dircct and practical approach
| of the'two Americans, an approach
| striking in contrast to the philosopji
| ic one of the Britishers.
Speakers Praised
Especially interesting is a letter
I received from a London school
! master:
j Gentlemen: Five minutes ago I
j switched off my wireless set with a
i feeling of profound disgust. Disgust
! with my own (or rather our own)
I University Debaters' poor show;
! and I felt in honor bound, as an
! Englishman to write to you in order
j to express what 80 per cent of us
i Britishers must also feel.
"Firstly, then, may I thank your
' kindly courtesy in saying how glad
j you were to hear an English voice
; and also that you hoped to meet
I your opponents on some future oc-

casions. Personally, I hope for
Britain's sake you never do. And
I may I apologize in their behalf, for
their utter discourtesy in failing to
reciprocate your kindliness.
Lauds Attack
"Secondly, I admired the practical
way in which you tackled your
viewpoint instead of Hogging that
dead horse of philosophical politics
: socialism vs. capitalism. As you most
truly said, 'If you're starving, it's
bread you need, not freedom of
1 speech.'
". . . Finally, I never through that
I should ever write and congratulate
I an American on anything. Speaking
quite frankly, your people jar my
nerves in many ways, a kind of an
tipathy difficult to explain. However,
I have had the pleasure of meeting
your men in France during the War
and since hearing your speeches
i some of the post-war antipathies
will fade away."
From Troy and Gloversville, New
1 York, from St. Paul, Minnesota, and
Alliance, Ohio, came greetings, but
| the debaters' cherished is a wire
from Joe Wolfe, '32, Harvard law
student, former varsity debater for
Stanford: "Grand Dick heartiest
congratulations to you Rogers and
bravo Lee. Joe Wolfe."
