# JAPANESE STUDENTS CAN EXPEL PROFS, SAYS LORY, FARM POLITICAL SCIENCE MAN

Students who think education at
Stanford is too dry—both as to pro
fessors and as to drinking—would
prefer a Japanese university.
In Japan the students may drink
openly, and when they don't like a
professor he has to resign. This joy
ful news of a student Utopia comes
from Hillis Lory, instructor in po
litical science, who came to Stanford
this fall after lecturing for several
years at the Hakkaido Imperial Uni
versity in northern Japan.
Lory pointed out that there is
drinking in Japan even at university
gatherings, and that one university
president who : aid the students
couldn't drink beer at the annual
college picnic was forced to resign
when the students demanded that
he do so.
"Japanese students have consid
erable authority regarding the poli
cies of the universities they attend,"
Lory explained. "If the students as
a whole dislike u professor, he usu
ally has to leave. The student body
even dictates policies regarding text
books. The classes appoint leaders

I to tell the administration what they
want. If they don't Ret what they
want, they go on strike."
Lory cited the ciise of a student
who was expelled for radical ideas.
The whole student body immedia
tely walked out. The efforts of the
faculty could not bring them back,
and even the pleadings of the Min
ister of Education did not placate
the students. They finally went back
to classes when the Emperor made
an appeal for closer harmony be
tween teachers and pupils through
- out the nation.
There is a completely democratic j
spirit in the Japanese colleges, Lory i
said. The students all dress alike, !
and there are no cliques of frater- I
nal orders to create social differ- j
ences.
He explained that while there are j
no restrictions on drinking, as in ;
Japan it is not a moral question,
that there is no apparent drunken
ness. Drink is made a question ol ;
morality only to Japanese Chris
tians who think that drinking and
i even smoking is unchristian.
