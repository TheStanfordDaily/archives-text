# WASHINGTON GREEKS PLAN NOVEL STUDY
## 
### 
Working toward educating all so-'
rority members about other national
sorority activities, I'anhellenic at
the I'niversity of Washington voted
to distribute a questionnaire con
eernnig national chapter business
to Washington's 24 sororities and
to compile the resulting informa
tion in a reference pamphlet.
"In the discussion at our lirst
dinner meeting last evening, we dis
covered that sorority members, as
well as pledges, are comparatively
ignorant of other natinal sororities
work," said the l'anhcllenic presi
dent. "In an effort to remedy this,
we are preparing this reference
pamphlet, and will attach it to the
latest chapter magazine of each so
rority to he studied at all chapter
meetings. Sororities will have read
information on all 2i of our na
tional organizations in the course
of the year by this method."
In order to further acquaint
pledges of different sororities, I'an
hellcnic members at the meeting
approved a program of pledge des
sert-exchanges last night.
