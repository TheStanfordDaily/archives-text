# TOYONITES' ATTACK TOO MUCH FOR CAT
## 
### 
The scream of heavy objects hur
tles through the air, shrapnel ricco
chcts in all directions, a form leans
' out a third-story window, swears
hysterically, cries, "It ain't a fit night
out for man nor beast." It is night
,at Toyon, and there is a cat, and
there are men, and there are hurt
ling objects.
'! In a tender, delicate rhythm the
! cat keeps up a musical accompani
! ment to the proceedings. Inside,
j human flesh and blood can stand no
more. Out from Toyon, issue silent,
thinking men. They capture the cat,
and place him in a laundry can,
doubtless musing on the rare, old
saying of "Can the chatter."
The cat subsides into the darkness,
but only for an instant. There is
savage blood in this cat. Years ago
its ancestors stalked the forest in a
; grim struggle to survive. Then Dar
win came along, and he gave evolu
tion to the world. And the lions and
tigers became laundry-can cats.
I All the savage blood beats and
pulses through its veins. One last
struggle will this cat make. Fur
rows mark its brows. With a mighty
leap and a wild spring for life this
cat came back.
Never more is heard from this
savage descendant of a savage for
bear. All is still at Toyon now.
Darkness envelops the fleeing cat.
Back in bed Toyonites in Toyon
nighties can not stand the stillness.
Suspense lingers in the air. Trying
to get sleep, they forsake counting
1 sheep, count cats.
