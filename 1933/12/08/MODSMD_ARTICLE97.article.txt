# ZOOLOGY STUDENTS WATCH COMRADE SWALLOW CATFISH
## 
### 
A catfish is a line thing in its
I place, 1 >111 its place is not in the
i gullet unless it's been first in the
j skillet. At least that is the opinion
I of William Chester Rockwell, who
j astonished zoology students early
j this week hy swallowing a live phy
i sostomous teleost fish, family Silu
j ridae, with several smaller allied
j families, the order Nematognathi.
According to reports of interested
bystanders, it all happened when
Rockwell was endeavoring to it
| move a youthful three-inch cattish
j from a glass container for the ex-
J press purpose of examining it. The
j young ichthyologist opened his
j mouth in amazement at the antics
I of his tinny friend, and said friend
| leapt up and into.
! Humane friends administered
!
i mcdicinals judiciously. â€¢
