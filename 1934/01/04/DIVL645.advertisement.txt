RED CAP does a rushing business
RED CAP will solve your problem
I of "what to serve" at that rush
party or bridge. Serve them sliced
. . . convenient, delicious and al
ways appreciated. There's a real
treat in the creamy fudge center,
crispy nut and milk
chocolate covering. A'
RED CAP dessert is
i u economical, too.
