## F.R. Pep Talk 
### 
As freely predicted, Congress met
in a docile mood yesterday. Some
months ago, firebrand Senator Dill
said, "Hell would pop"; it didn't;
after three minutes of cheering, F.R.,
attired in morning suit, delivered his
pep talk.
Talking for exactly 21 minutes,
IHo President said nothing especially
startling, confined himself princi
pally to reviewing progress made to
date. Important feature was the
tone of the speech, decidedly an
appeal for real social, economic, po
litical reform rather than for just
plain recovery. Optimism stood out
throughout, save in foreign affairs.
Here outlook is very sad; higher
tariffs, war imminent.
# * -n .
Taking notice of opposition, F.R.
pointed (<» sharp and clear division
between recovery by return to the
old order, and recovery by reform
ol old methods. Highlight: "It is our
task to perfect, to improve, to alter
when necessary, but in all cases to
>jo forward."

Congressional comment varied:
Said Speaker Rainey: ". . . . an in
spiring document." Echoed House
Leader Byrns: ". . . . brief but com- J
prehensive." Senate G.O.P. leader
chimed in: "Exhilirating .... I shall:
make every sacrifice a Republican
can made." Die-hard lowan Dick- !
inson snorted: "full of platitudes." i
The Kingfish of washroom fame \
thought/ it was not very specific, i
Press comment generally favor- j
able; but conservative news organs I
are expected to see the Socialistic |
bogeyman anytime now.
