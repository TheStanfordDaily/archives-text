# WILBUR DENIES THAT BAWLOUT HARMS CAMPUS
## President Upholds Present Status; Stresses Need Of Facing Reality 
### Charlotte Burridge 
Scorning the idea that publication
of grade points in the Bawl-out is
unfair, Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur yes
terday stressed the necessity of fac
ing reality and truth. In response
|to the accusations of some faculty
members, the president denied any
j unfairness of the present method.
"Isn't it fair to give recognition
|to those who attain success?" he
I asks. "Just because it's a little hard
I on the people at the bottom is no
j reason for doing away with it. We
j have to be able to meet competi
; tion. It's just part of life," Dr. Wil
| bur explained.
The veteran educator considers
the reason for objection to grade
records to be the painfulness of
i making distinctions, not the un
' fairness to the handicapped stu
i dents. In an institution of stand
j ards like Stanford, it is more
I necessary to protect the strong
than to sympathize with the weak,
Dr. Wilbur believes. He explained
j that a person can't just get by in
i the University any more than in
the business world. He has to be
| able to meet competition.
"Grades are a person's standing in
! relation to his fellow students. It's
j life's reality, why not lace the facts?
I We can't go around with a bunch of
I excuses. That's the trouble with a
! lot of people," he says.
Dr. Wilbur considers the record
lof a student's accomplishments a
fair picture of his character. The
impressions formed from Bawl-out
ratings, the president explained, are
invaluable when appointments are
I made and also in gaining a true
! opinion of a fellow student's worth,
i because it eliminates all bluffing.
"Acts as Incentive"
If publication of scholastic records
I i.s discontinued, the paper ought to
j stop printing game scores, names of
j those who made fumbles, those
j eliminated from Daily staff positions,
; and all other results of competi
! tion, the administrator maintains.
He believes success to be the in
centive for work, and thus considers
| grade point publishing a stimulus
1 for study. "Some people want to
â–  abolish all grades, abolish admission
|to shows, and sit under a bread
j fruit tree and wait for the bread
! fruit to drop," he said.
