# Year's Quad Sales Slump
## 
### 
Although Quad sales to under
classmen exceed those at this time
last year, seniors are postponing
their purchasing, and sales are con
siderably behind last year's schedule.
Business Manager Hal Whit
field was disappointed with the
] sale in front of the administra
i building during registration yes
i terday. He said the sale was very
i poor. A spccial sale on the Engi
i ncering Corner will take place to
morrow morning.
Last year seniors who desired to
have pictures printed were required
to pay a $2 deposit on their year
books, whether they intended to
purchase the book or not. Whitfield
pointed out that no deposit is re
quired this year. He blames the
let-down in sales to this fact. In
a statement last night, the manager
I urged co-operation of the senior
I class in signing early.
The 1933 Quad was a sell-out.
| Whitfield said the number of books
I to be published is limited, and many
j who fail to sign soon may be disap
i pointed. The Quad sells for $5.65
I this year.
