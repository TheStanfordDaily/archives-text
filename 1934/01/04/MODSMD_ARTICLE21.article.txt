# University 'Lowers' Entrance Standards In New Policy Move
## Work in Last Three Prep Years to Be Stressed Under New Plan 
### Stan Beaubaire 
Drastic revamping of Stanford's
admission requirements as revealed
recently will permit preparatory
school graduates to enter the Uni
j versity under new lenient regula
. tions which "overlook" poor scholas
| tic work done during the first of the
four high school years.
New students may hereafter be
admitted with first year standing
j with as low as nine recommending
units earned during their last three
years of preparatory school, pro
vided certain conditions are met, ac
cording to an Academic Council
| ruling.
Immediate Effects Seen
Immediate effects of the new dic
tum, as seen by informed observers
on the campus, indicate:
1. A large number of new fresh
men who heretofore have been
unable to apply for admission to
the University because of academic
difficulties early in their prep
school work may now enroll at
1 Stanford.
2. VVitli the new conditions pre
vailing, ail freshmen quotas may
be up to the maximum by next
fall.
3. Applicants for admission may
excel! in preparatory school work
during their last two and a half
years and still enter the Univer
sity, even having done inferior
work previously.
According to the Registrar's office,
there has been no reduction in ad
mission requirements, but instead
there has been a "change in em
phasis."
"Experience has shown," says an
official statement, "that many stu
dents do not find themselves in the
first part of the preparatory school
course, or in the junior high school.
The new Stanford plan selects stu
dents for what they have done just
before admission to the University
rather than in the first part of the
preparatory course."

Immediate Effects Seen
Immediate effects of the new dic
tum, as seen by informed observers
on the campus, indicate:
1. A large number of new fresh
men who heretofore have been
unable to apply for admission to
the University because of academic
difficulties early in their prep
school work may now enroll at
1 Stanford.
2. VVitli the new conditions pre
vailing, ail freshmen quotas may
be up to the maximum by next
fall.
3. Applicants for admission may
excel! in preparatory school work
during their last two and a half
years and still enter the Univer
sity, even having done inferior
work previously.
According to the Registrar's office,
there has been no reduction in ad
mission requirements, but instead
there has been a "change in em

"Experience has shown," says an
official statement, "that many stu

first part of the preparatory school
course, or in the junior high school.
The new Stanford plan selects stu
dents for what they have done just
before admission to the University
rather than in the first part of the
preparatory course."
