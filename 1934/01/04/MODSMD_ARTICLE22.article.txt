# Not Football, But Water Polo Seen At Rose Bowl
## 
### GEORGE WILSON 
Noticed during the week-end of
the water polo tilt in the Pasadena
Rose Bowl:
New Year's eve revellers wading
barefoot through 12 inches of water
in down-town Los Angeles .... The
45th annual Tournament: of Roses
having for its theme, "The Talc of
the Seven Seas," with most floats in
the form of boats .... a sleepy
Stanford band arriving on the line
of march at 8:30 in the morning, re
treating into their buses when the
parade started in the rain.
Surprisingly large number of
spectators braving the elements to
watch the parade .... a Stanford
banner, Hanked by two posters say
ing "Twenty Thousand Leagues un
der the Sea" .... someone calling
"when does the tide go out."
The Rose Bowl reservoir pumped
out enough for spectators to wade
through the mud (o their seals , . . .

Columbia's Montgomery getting his ;
share of the mud when a tackier j
threw him past the sidelines into j
the track .... the tuba player in |
the band having trouble playing. !
finding the difficulty to be several j
buckets of rainwater inside the bell \
of his horn.
Fifteen thousand umbrellas ap- '
pearing and disappearing as showers ;
crossed the stadium .... Hoover, !
Will Rogers, and the two-minute ap
pearance of the sun getting the big
gest cheers of the day .... Beau
baire's water card stunts being ex
plained to the crowd rather than
actually attempted.
The trek out through the mud to
the cars .... Frexy Wilbur mired
in the mud, whistling while waiting
for his car .... the "tide" finally
going out, and the return to Paly,
where it never rains, but only
showers.
