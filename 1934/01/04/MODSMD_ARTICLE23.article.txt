# ODDS AND DOPE UPSET BY LION ROSE BOWL WIN
## Underrated Columbia Team Proves, Well-Drilled, Smooth Outfit GRAYSON OUTSTANDING Fumbles, Penalties Prevent Stanford Scores 
### Charles Chapped 
While the football "experts" and
the four-to-one betting gentlemen
looked on with jaws agape, Stan
ford's Indians had the doubtful dis
tinction last Monday of being on the
wrong end of the first and possibly
the greatest sports upset of 1934 at
the hands of a greatly underrated
Columbia football machine.
Stanford showed flashes of the
power and speed that swept through
to victory over Southern California
and California and that terrified the
East into believing their Lions would
be slaughtered by the big, bad Red
skins. These flashes occurred fre
quently but never lasted long
enough to result in any much
needed touchdowns.
Columbia Well-Drilled
Time after time Bobby Grayson
and his cohorts swept down within
striking distance of the goal line.
And time after time something hap
pened—a fumble, a penalty, an in
spired Columbia defense—while the
sympathetic Southern California
skies broke down and wept at the
heartbreaking sight.
A number of alibis could be of
fered to explain away Stanford's
7 to 0 setback but one of the best
is probably the fact that in the per
sons of the Columbia Lions the In
dians met one of the smoothest,
Speediest, and best-drilled aggrega
tions that they encountered all sea
son.
Barabas Scores
The only score of the game camc
in the second quarter after a well
executed pt.ss from Cliff Montgom
ery, Columbia's great triple-threat
quarterback, to Tony Matal, who
was tackled near Stanford's 16-yard
line. Barabas lost a yard on the
following play only to take the ball
on the next try and circle Stanford's
right end for 17 yards and a touch
down. Effective as it was unexpected,
the scoring play was a beautiful
piece of work that fooled the Indian
defense and accomplished what few
of the near 40,000 spectators thought
could possibly happen. Wilder con
verted for the Lions.
Coming back fighting, Stanford
finished the second quarter with a
drive that promised great things for
the last half. The Indians lost little
time in getting started in the second
half. As soon as they got possession
of the ball Grayson broke loose for
a 25-yard gain to his own 45. Engi
neered by Grayson and Hamilton the
drive ended inside Columbia's 20-
yard line where a holding penalty
set Stanford back to the 32.
Two Touchdown Drives
Two more potential touchdown
drives in the same quarter ended on
'flie Columbia 13 and 4-yard lines
wh'.-n the slimy pigskin slipped out
of Grayson's grasp and was recov
ered by alert Columbians in both
cases. On the last of these drives
Grayson broke loose near the side
lines and might have gotten away
but for an official who happened to
be standing in the wrong place at the
wrong time and couldn't get out of
the way fast enough for Stanford's
fleet footed fullback.
A stonewall defense and a couple
of fumbles wrote finis to this scoring
effort despite the fact that the ball
had been carried to the Columbia
4-yard line for a first down.
One more drive in the fourth
quarter resulted in a Stanford first
down on the Columbia 14 but again
the Lions tightened up their defense
and threw back the Indians' last
scoring effort. A few desperate last
minute passes failed to connect and
the game ended shortly after Co
lumbia had taken the ball on downs
on Stanford's 6-yard line.
Statistics could be quoted giving
Stanford a great advantage in the
matter of yards gained but the score
book still reads 7 to 0 in favor of
Columbia and that, it seems, is the
deciding factor. Grayson, playing a
brilliant game that was marred only
by a -few costly fumbles, alone
gained 160 yards to 138 from passes
and scrimmage for the entire Colum
bia team.
Stanford's total yardage from
scrimmage and passes came to 295
along with 13 first downs to five
for the easterners. A dry field,
fewer fumbles, fewer penalties, any
of these might have made a differ
ence bu( it just didn't happen that
way.
