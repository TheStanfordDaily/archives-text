# The 						Good Old Days
## 
### 
I he past lias an interest for all of us. For some, it has
extra fascination, a hypnotic pull, that forces the indivi
dual to jump up and scream out: "The older the better;
give me the good old days." What is good about the old
days is never very clear.
This phobia is most acute among college alumni. At
every reunion, you can see the old fellows tottering
around the lobby, muttering about the Stanford that used
to be. Sometimes they are right; but more often, they are
just suffering from acute histomania, worship of the past.
In one regard at least, Stanford has advanced so far
that one looks back at the old days and wonders if the
"Farm" not only applied to the physical locale, but the in
tellectual vision of the University leaders.
Last quarter, XormamThomas and Upton Sinclair both
spoke 011 the Campus. Mr. Thomas is American socialism
made articulate. And Mr. Sinclair was a socialist, and is
now a socialist running for the gubernatorial nomination
on the Democratic ticket. This would have been consid
ered sure indication of inveterate insanity in the past.
Today il is accepted.
Part of the change is due to the change in the times.
We lind respectable people openly advocating socialism
on the one hand, and too, the concept of freedom of
thought is growing. Witch-burning is in'marked decline
and only in Germany does the government go out of its
way to prat about the greatness of intolerance.
Yel while this generation accepts that brace of speak
ing socialists, there was a lime when a debate on water
bonds was ruled off the campus and forced into that hot
bed of radicalism, Palo Alto.
And while we are speaking of the great liberalism of
(be old Stanford, we recall that the old Stanford seals
were afraid to bear the University motto, "The Wind of
Freedom Is Blowing." For all we know, the Official Uni
versity Seal still shvs from these liberal sounding words.
