Now that "feeble, anemic" Columbia lias beaten
"strong, invincible" Stanford (see Southern California
sports scribes) we may almost expect almost anything in
the way of upsets.
Perhaps the W.C.T.U. will announce that "drinking
lias great cultural advantages." Dr. Mitchell will say,
"We\e not only going to give up the Bawl-Out, but the
whole grading system; figuring out the averages gets us
down." The American Legion will pass a resolution recog
nizing Russia, and the D.A.R. will announce, "We're really
thinking of making Stalin an honorary member."
A greater wonder has happened: An American univer
sity sells beer on the campus. The t nion of the University
of Wisconsin now sells beer at five cents a stein. Free
pretzels, too. (What, no peanuts?) The only catch is that
co-eds are eligible only on Friday and Saturday nights,
while men can satisfy their beer lusts every night.
