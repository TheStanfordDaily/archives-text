Tliou,<<li the editorial l'cct arc slill a bit damp, the
(lame which caused that dampness is over. It is over for
;iil 1 >111 sports maniacs (sports writers who get paid by the
word); this one elass will he talking and making excuses
for some time, even after our feet are completely dry.
That may seem inconceivable; hut it is essentially true.
There is practically nothing to say about the (lame,
and the logical assumption would be to say nothing. Hut
logic is a very artificial science, and hence quite baffling
to many, including ourselves, and the readers, too, no
doubt.
Hut this can be said about the team. They are just as
good its they were before this upset. Thev are entitled to
no damning by bleacher coaches, and other experts. The
fact that the score was what it was should have no effect
on anything, anything including those men who wallowed
in Pasadena mud, Coach Tliornhill, and of course the
I nivcrsitv.
The Daily staff will convene in extra session TODAY
at I; 15 o'clock. Neither President nor Mrs. Roosevelt will
address the meeting but all are required l ( > be present
nonetheless.
