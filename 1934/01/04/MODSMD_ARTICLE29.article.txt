# BULL SESSION
## AGAIN THE LITTLE THEATRE 
### 
It is to be regretted that the ad
mittedly zealous but unimaginative
committees which select the season's
program for the average little thea
tre, tread the familiar path already
pioneered by the commercial theatre
and popularized by the cinema as
well as the little theatres them
selves.
I select as an example of this
sheeplike procedure, the Palo Alto
Community Players, not at all be
cause they are unique, but because
they afford an example at once clear
and immediate.
Listed as under consideration for
the new season, are "Secret Serv
ice," "Bulldog Drummond," "Tea for
Three," "Caprice," "Topaze," "When
Ladies Meet," "Old English," and
"possible new releases."
It is not my purpose to cavil at
these plays, some of which have a
deeper merit than the amusement
which characterizes the selection as
a whole. I seek rather to demon
strate that, the virtues —however
thin—of this list granted, the list
itself indicates a frenzied desire to
attain the trivial honor of repeating
the already sufficiently echoed.
The purpose of the little theatre
i.s, I take it, essentially to entertain.
But I doubt the value, as entertain
ment of such procedure. Further,
thex - e is little or no stimulation to
the sincere worker in the theatre,
in toying about with the trivialities

| obvious in any such selection as the
one presented.
This is more important than may
be immediately apparent, for the
worker thrives upon problems which
offer some serious opposition, some
1 intelligence in solution. It is enter
taining to play about in a "Private
Lives" as it is amusing to watch it
from the audience. But such amuse
ment cloys eventually and the in
telligent actor and director seek
some more substantial test of their
j abilities. To be satisfied earlier is
' an admission of mediocrity.
This is not to suggest that the
Players—or any other Little Theatre
group—should immediately leap into
production of Shakespearean tragedy
to the exclusion of anything less dif
ificult or demanding. But there are
I other fields, at once of equal satis
faction to the audience and of far
greater merit in the larger field of
the drama, which are far too care
lessly overlooked in the scramble to
: obtain rights upon a new play—if
only after the cinema version of it
has been generously circulated.
I hope shortly to print a list of
I such plays. Meanwhile it may be
'sufficient to mention eighteenth cen
tury comedy and such a frequently
mentioned but infrequently seen ex
ample as "She Stoops to Conquer,"
| and the problem of plays of the late
nineteenth century represented by a
i wise selection from the works of
i Ibsen. —James Sandoe.
