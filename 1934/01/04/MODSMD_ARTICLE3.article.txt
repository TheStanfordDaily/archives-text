Still taking stock of damage after
its greatest flood and cloudburst, Los
Angeles was threatened by typhoid,
county health officials took precau

Debris were still being cleaned
away, but streets are in a bad way;
lots of real estate has moved hither
and thither. Tragic side of record
rainfall of 0 inches in 24 hours be
comes steadily more apparent.
Known dead are 40; unnumbered
bodies were probably carried out to
sea by raging Los Angeles river,
usually a dry gulch.
