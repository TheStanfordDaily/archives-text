## STEAM SCALDS SORORITIES 
### 
Much water has run under the
bridge since the Daily came forth
with the dreary prognostication that
60 per cent of you sorority-minded
freshmen would be sadly disap
pointed on pledge day this year.
You have been to sorority teas.
You have been lied to and lied
about, gushed to and gushed about,
cussed and discussed. You have
told some 200 simpering sisters that
you come from Portland, Omaha,
Monrovia, and Timbuctoo and no,
you're awfully sorry but you just
don't happen to know the Joe
B'inkes of Long Beach, Phoenix,
and Trinity Center.
You know or will know that
you've been dinged because you in
advertently held your teacup with
your wrong hand, your nose was
shiny, your awful green hat was
unbecoming and you used the word
"swell."
You know, judging from the num
ber of illegal contacts you must

know, that you will be accorded the
honor of another invitation because
you have a nice wave, cute dimple,
good-looking brother, use the word
"lousy" and because you're a le
gacy and just can't be helped.
The annual fiasco of petty politics
involved in picking the honored
pledges has blossomed forth prema
turely by much foaming at the ears
from four resigned members of Cap
and Gown hitting ingeniously upon
a plan to preserve membership in
the society to a three-house combi
nation by virtue of automatic mem
bership for all women in "high"
campus offices.
Three to six dollar fines to soror
ity women failing to show up for a
tea on any given day. Gawd help
'em if they don't attend the house
meeting afterward. Gawd help 'em
if they do.
Is this worth three years? And
300 freshmen still say yes—damn it.
