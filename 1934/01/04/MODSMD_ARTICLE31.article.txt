LITTLE WOMEN (RKO)
At the Stanford Theatre
This picturization of the Alcott
classic is already established as one
of the outstanding film achievements
of the talking era, and so most criti
cal comments one could make would
be highly inadequate and distinctly
superfluous.
One interesting aspect of the really
splendid production of this time
honored story remains to be seen.
However, it is safe to say that the
future will see a tremendous influx
of "homely" stories, not too subtly
patterned after-the current Hepburn
success.
Just as "Cavalcade" was followed
with a flood of "monumental" epics,
and "Forty-Second Street" with a
collossal line of musicals, "Little
Caesar" with a succession of gang
ster yarns, so Hollywood will un
doubtedly run true to type and de
cline to let well enough alone.
"Little Women" is a masterpiece
of adaptation, direction, casting,
and acting—thai, I think, will oc
cur to almost all who view it.
The successors will probably be
generally badly done, and will be
largely pervaded with a nauseating
saccharine quality and an offensive
sentimentality. Of course, there is

the possibility — exceedingly remote
in this instance—that there will ap
pear from somewhere a successor
j which will top the original product,
just as "Scarface" surpassed "Lit
tle Caesar."
Probably along with the fond
ness for sentimental and homely
stories will come an increased
consciousness of the fact that a
| good many classics which have
I been sneered at for some time
i may provide good film material.
Perhaps we may even expect a
serious and workmanlike "picturiza
tion of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" with
i Jean Harlow as Little Eva and Joan
j Crawford as Topsy. Who knows?
Meanwhile, "Little Women" stands
!as a splendid and sincere picture,
| well-rounded in every particular,
I and greatly enhanced by the superb
i performance of the dynamic Kath
j arine Hepburn. —Chapin
