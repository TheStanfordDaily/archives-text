# Now Sacramento

### 
While Southern Calii'ornia sput
tered and toiled and tried to get the i
mud and sand out of its collective !
face, Yolo County ranchers re- j
ceived Sacramento river flood warn
ings last night.
The Feather river is rising, conse
quently, the Sacramento swells.
Height measured at Knight's Land
ing, 29 , Â£ feet. At that point the val
ley floor will go under at 30 feet.
Ranchers in the district are not j
particularly worried. They have had |
I several warnings, have moved all
valuables from cellar to attic and 1
are stoically awaiting a flood that \
( may never come.
