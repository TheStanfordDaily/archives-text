# Thirty New Women Added To '800' for This Quarter
## 
### 
About 30 new women were added
to the enlarging "800"' by this quar
ter's registration. A remarkably
small number of old women did not
return, according to Miss Alice In
gram, secretary to the Dean of
Women.
Thirteen freshmen living at Roble
made up the largest group of those
entering for the winter quarter. Only
one of the eight moving to the Union
dormitory is a new woman. Castil
leja is housing six, Madrona one,
and Harker's two, of the entering 30.
Some graduate women and some off
campus students are also included.
