# Babe Ruth Begins Work To Get in Shape for 1934
## 
### 
Babe Ruth has begun his 3 934
workouts to get in shape for an
other creditable season, probably his
last.
On February 7 the Babe will cele
brate his fortieth birthday and it is
feared that the slumps which he
took last year in batting will con
tinue this year. Ho was benched for
the first time in his career last sea
son for poor batting. In 1935 he
will probably become manager of
the New York Yankees.
