# GOLDSMITH PLAY FIRST READING ON WINTER SCHEDULE
## 
### 
"She Stoops to Conquer," Oliver
Goldsmith's brilliant comedy, has
been selected as the first reading of
three to be sponsored by Sword and
Sandals, men's honorary dramatic
organization, during the winter
quarter.
This play, inevitably mentioned
with Sheridan's "The Rivals," and
his "The School for Scandal" as rep
resentative of eighteenth century
comedy at its height, is produced
according to critics, with ludicrous
infrequency, despite the touting of
its obvious and considerable merits.
Zimansky Selecting Cast
Curt Zimansky will direct and is
selecting a cast, to be announced
shortly, which gives promise of a
highly amusing evening. The play
v/ill be read on Thursday evening,
January 11, in the Little Theatre.
Sword and Sandals has several in
teresting plays under consideration
for the other readings of the quarter.
Among them are Tom Taylor's dra
matization of "A Tale of Two Cities,"
first produced in 1860 under the su
pervision of Mr. Charles Dickens,
"Oedipus Rex," "The Taming of the
Shrew," "The Beaux's Stratagem,"
and several modern plays, including
"Let 'Em Eat Cake," in the event
that reading rights may be obtained
from the authors, who previously
granted the right to read "Of Thee
I Sing" to the organization.
Tryouts Open to All
While the early presentation date
of "She Stoops to Conquer" has nec
essitated an arbitrary casting of the
play, tryouts for other readings will
be open to all those interested in
