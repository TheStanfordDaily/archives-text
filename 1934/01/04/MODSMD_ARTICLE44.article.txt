# RAIN PUTS DAMPER ON ROOTERS' STUNTS
## 
### 
Back at Stanford after a pleasant i
journey to Pasadena for New Year's I
were 6,000 rooters' cards, many pom
poms. Bright and fresh the cards
were and ready for future use for
rooting stunts, since the heavy ,
Southern California dew operating
during the halves of the Stanford-
Columbia Rose Bowl game made
rooters' stunts impossible.
Elaborate stunts had been planned
by Stanford's Rally Committee.
Rushing out from the depot with |
the ton of cards on the morning of
the game, the committee tacked en
velopes of cards to the seats during i
one of the passing downpours; but |
the cards remained snug and warm
underneath Stanford Cards during
the halves.
Among the stunts planned were
ones saying: "Roar, Lion, Roar,"
"Hello Lou," "Hail Rose Bowl,"
"Happy New Year," and showing
the Stanford tree, the axe on dif- j
ferent modernistic and checkered |
fields.
