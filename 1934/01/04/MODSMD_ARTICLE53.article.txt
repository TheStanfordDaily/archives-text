Through the slush driving home
from Pasadena's Duel: Ponu, for
merly known as the Rose Bowl,
in never-again-to-be-called-Sunny
Southern California, the many waits
at puddle-crossings afforded conve
nient times for cogitations.
Somehow it was hard to do so,
though. Particularly if one still
considered oneself a loyal Son of
the Stanford Red. The wet feet
would have been much less both
ersome, one felt, if only that mis
erable scoreboard hadn't shown
those doughty Lions 7 points the
superior of Big Red swimming
foot ha Hers.
With the memory still fresh of the
once underrate d, soon-to-be-ovc-r
-rated Morningside Heights men
mudding through better than the
ground - gaining, points-not-gained
Indians, similar incidents aided not
a bit in destroying that gloomy feel
ing.
As in the days of the Old Fox, the
empty yardage victory was all Stan
ford's, by a margin of about 2 ] /a
times to be explicit. So was it last
year against the Trojans. So was it
in the Rose Bowl against Alabama
the year of the 7-7 tie. So it was
hoped it would never be again after
the advent of the New Football Deal.
So will it never be againâ€”we hope.
