# JUST ONE OF THOSE ANSWERLESS QUERIES
## 
### 
'"What was the matter with Stan
ford?" its supporters asked and
were asked. Many possible answers
were suggested. None of them rung
true. The wetness was too feeble,
too obvious. The fumbles — only
seven with a sopping ball — that
could have been worse. The officials
—an age-old gripe, and in the case
fairly a just one—could scarcely be
blamed for the loss of the game.
The victor Lions must be given
credit for a whale of a defensive
game and a lot of quick action in
garnering in the "breaks." Yet it
seemed hard to realize, harder to
stomach the cold fact that a team
which made more yards in one
quarter (the third) than their op
ponents did in the whole game
could possibly lose. But it did.
Nothing very radical seemed to be
wrong with Stanford. An undaunted
team, on six separate occasions it
drove from the shadow of its own
goal deep into enemy scoring terri
tory, only to be set back by penal
ties, fumbles, and a fighting oppo
nent.
