# FOOTBALL NEVER WAS EASY TO FIGURE

### 
The more football games we see—
the more we think you just can't
"figger 'em." Once we thought it
was all so simple, that the best team
on paper before the game was a
cinch to have the biggest numbers
on its side of the ledger after the
game. But it isn't that way—maybe
that's why football is so darn in
teresting.
After it's all said and done "most
big college games see eleven fairly
good men on both sides. Some are
better, some not so good—yes. But
there are a lot of variables. It's a
good-sized field with only one foot
ball for them all to fight for. A
number of things can happen. Many
of them do.
Of course wild rooters felt pretty
badly because Grayson's seeming
touchdown race was ended by an
in-the-way official. But maybe if
he'd scored it the Lions might have
gotten blood-thirsty and scored some
more themselves. As "Tiny," ever a
good sport, remarked, "those things
happen." When it was all over there
was still only one touchdown scored.
Unfortunately "close" never counted
except in horseshoe games.
