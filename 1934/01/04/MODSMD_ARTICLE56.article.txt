# STRONG FEELINGS OF A MARINE
## 
### 
A consoling thought in our mud
puddle ruminations recalled a tight
lipped, stern-faced member of Uncle
Samuel's famous leathernecks. There
he sat, hands clenched, aching to
swing on somebocfy. He had never
heard of Grayson. He had a vague
idea that Columbia was playing
Stanford, which was all his definite
information on the subject.
What he saw was one scrapping
team, several times thwarted by
penalties, their own fumbles, and
"bum luck." He thought they de
served to win. That they didn't do
so ran crosswise to his streak of
fair play. Somehow he made us a

bit less miserable. Maybe we had a
similar feeling.
With dry feet again set on the
Farm, the world seems a bit less dis
mal, footballically speaking. Stan
ford still has a great, fighting foot
ball team, which has what it takes
—ability and intestinal fortitude—
and there still are some Stanford
followers who are itching to see
them in action.—Kline.
