# INDIAN CAGE MEN SHOW PROMISE IN PRE-SEASON TILTS
## 
### Roger Kimball 
Getting ofT to a better start than
past Stanford outfits, Coach John
Bunn's varsity basketball team has
won two of its first three practice
games. In a trio of close struggles,
the Card quintet has defeated San
Jose State, 35 to 28, lost to College
of the Pacific, 22 to 21, and nosed out
St. Mary's by a narrow 34 to 32 mar
gin.
The game with the Gaels Tuesday
night in the Pavilion was the most
satisfying from the point of view of
a Stanford supporter, as the Indians
showed steady improvement .and
flashes of good teamwork.
Beat San Jose
The 1934 Cardinal cage team
started a short barnstorming tour
with a spotty game at San Jcse
with the State Teachers on Decem
ber 29. After a hardwood fight fea
tured largely by football tactics,
Stanford emerged on top of the heap
by a seven-point margin. Every one
of the twelve Card players used in
this game scored at least one point,
with no single man netting more
than five. Downs of San Jose was
high point man of the game with ten
digits to his credit. In this contest,
Arne Anderson and "Biff" Jenkins,
forwards, and Chuck Rogers, a
guard, showed the ability which
lined them up as early season regu
lars.
Traveling to Stockton, Coach
Bunn's aggi'egation showed slightly
more polish, though taking a one
point licking from the Pacific Tigers.
Stanford's floorwork tvas fairly good
for an early-season game, but the
Indians missed countless set-ups due
to faulty shooting. This was another
hard-fought game, with the defense
predominating more than at San
Jose.
Page, Cosgrove Good
In spite of the setback, the Cards
had improved over their exhibition
of the previous night, since Pacific's
Wilson, Hamilton, O'Dell, Stro
bridge, and other football stars are
fully as expert on the court as on
the gridiron, and afforded stiffer
competition than San Jose. A1 Page,
a junior who plays either forward
or guard, and Jack Cosgrove, vet
eran guard, looked good for Stanford
against the Stockton Tigers.
When the improved Redskins re
turned to the Farm for the tilt with
St. Mary's Tuesday evening. Ander
son and Jenkins had established
themselves as first-string forwards,
with consistent Captain Hal Edelen
at center, and Rogers and Cosgrove
as the regular guards. This line-up
played reckless, in-and-out basket
ball at the start against the danger
ous Moragans, committing about
twice the normal number of fouls.
The sharpshooting Gaels made good
on all their early free throws, gain
ing the upper hand in spite of their
failure to sink any baskets until the
first half was nearly over.
Cards Lead at Half
Many a Stanford shot was missing
the mark at the same time, however,
and the Cardinals didn't have St.
Mary's ability to score on gift shots.
As a result, St. Mary's overcame a
very early Stanford lead to hold a
9 to 5 advantage midway in the first
1 half. Arne Anderson, clever Mcnlo
j transfer, then cut loose from his left
forward position with four nice bas
â–  kets in a row to put the Indians
j ahead again, in spite of the Gallop
ing Gaels' foul conversions.
! Jack Cosgrove's pair of long shots
and another short one by Anderson
gave Stanford the upper hand by a
j 17-14 margin at half time, as Rock
well and Meade had been so well
bottled up that St. Mary's had made
only two baskets during the first
; half.
Gael Gainc Close
Although the Gaels checked An
derson and finally got him out of
the game on fouls, Page and Edelen
led a second-half assault which shot
Bunn's Redskins into a lead of 26 to
i 1(J. This advantage was short-lived,
1 however, as Hanna and Lange sank
I four baskets for the Gaels and Rock
j well scored a point or two every few
j minutes. Before Stanford knew it,
St. Mary's was right on her heels
and threatening to win in a wild
j orgy of fast, play and hurried shots.
At one time, the score was 30 to
! 29, with the crowd in an uproar.
! Herb Jenkins and Bud Cowhig i~e
| moved the tension just in time, with
a basket 'and a brace of free throws,
! helping their teammates stave off
[ this desperate last-minute rally of
I Coach Vince O'Donnell's Marauding
| Moragans, Stanford barely winning
; by a 34-32 margin. Anderson scored
' fifteen markers for high-point hon
ors.
The next games for the Card five
are tomorrow and Saturday nights
I in San Francisco's Civic Auditorium
against the University of Utah and
| the Utah Aggies. Both of these quin
( tets are of dangerous strength, par
ticularly the state university hoop
sters from Salt Lake. Stanford will
probably be a slight underdog, in
spite of her better-than-average be
i ginning and the presence of several
of Tiny Thornhill's football proteges
| on the court.
