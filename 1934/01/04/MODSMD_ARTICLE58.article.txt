After all the ballyhoo accorded Stanford and the top-heavy betting odds quoted on the coast's pride, little
Columbia University of New York came out of the east to administer a 7-0 beating in the Rose IJowl New
Year's Day classic. Above bit of action from the game shows Bobby Grayson, Stanford fullback, on one
uf his long gains which never were capitalized into a touchdown. Montgomery, Columbia, is ready to tackle.
