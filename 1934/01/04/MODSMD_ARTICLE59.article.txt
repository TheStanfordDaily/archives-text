Playing before packed houses in
j California's inland cities, Jimmy
I Bradshaw's frosh basketball five
hooped their way through two suc
cessful junkets during the Christmas
holidays, winning each of their
j games by comfortable margins.
Bfick at the Farm with a clean
! slate, with victories over high school,
! junior college, and municipal forces,
i the Babes are now preparing for
coming tilts with Balboa and Galileo
High Schools of San Francisco.
Bakersfield Smothered
Bakersfield was first to be smoth
ered by a barrage of field goals. The
last day of the autumn quarter the
Babes met the local high school, and
j even though the long drive from
| Palo Alto and finals were completed
[ only a short hour before the start
I of the fray, the frosh succeeded in
1 turning back the Oilers by a 33-19
j score.
Next night the Bakersfield Jay
j sees provided the competition but
the frosh found the bucket with
greater ease, and tallied 53 to their
opponents' 33. Bill Quade, right for
ward, led the Babes in scoring, tank-
I ing 9 field goals and four free throws.
Packers Take Papooses
After Christmas Bradshaw took
j his squad to Watsonville where the
j city team, which included Phil Ba
ker of last year's varsity and Greg
! orson, a guard with California var
sity experience, met the Papooses,
1 The Packers, in spite of decided ad
' vantages in both size and experience,
I could not throttle the Indian for-
I wards, both Turner and Quade ac
: counting for 17 digits, so lost by a
45-30 margin.
Previous to the holidays the frosh
scrimmaged with Golden Gate Jun
ior College of San Francisco and
' Marin Junior College, and although
no official count was made the
' Babes won by comfortable margins.
The Marin quintet, last year's Cali
-1 fomia's Jaysee champs, showed
j some high class individual stars but
| lacked teamwork, while poor guard
ing allowed the frosh to score re
peatedly on set ups.

I could not throttle the Indian for-
I wards, both Turner and Quade ac
: counting for 17 digits, so lost by a
45-30 margin.
Previous to the holidays the frosh
scrimmaged with Golden Gate Jun
ior College of San Francisco and
' Marin Junior College, and although
no official count was made the
' Babes won by comfortable margins.
The Marin quintet, last year's Cali
-1 fomia's Jaysee champs, showed
j some high class individual stars but
| lacked teamwork, while poor guard
ing allowed the frosh to score re
peatedly on set ups.
