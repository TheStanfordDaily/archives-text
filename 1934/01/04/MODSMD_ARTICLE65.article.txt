# Men's Council Suspends Violator of Honor Code
## 
### 
Suspension from Stanford for
Ihree months and a Hunk in an Eng
lish course are the penalties inflicted
upon a student who was caught
breaking the honor code the last
week of the autumn quarter.
An English composition handed in
as original, was found to have been
copied from a popular current mag
azine.
With the suspension of the stu
dent whose breach of the code was
the only case of the fall quarter, the
Men's Council calls attention of the
students to the fact that work done
in the privacy and handed in as
original is subject to the code of
honor just as is work done in the
class rooms.
