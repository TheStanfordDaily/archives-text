# Fire Wrecks Engineering Lab, Damages Chemicals
## 
### 
Mechanical engineers experienced
a warm beginning of the Yuletide
vacation when a fire started in the
laboratory a day or two prior to
the end of the autumn quarter. The
lab caught fire when an oil bath
being prepared for some experi
mental work boiled over, did several
hundred dollars worth of damage,
and was finally extinguished by the
fire department.
Included in the damage was about
fifty dollars worth of chemicals, as
well as the wrecking of the lab
oratory, which was covered by in
surance.
