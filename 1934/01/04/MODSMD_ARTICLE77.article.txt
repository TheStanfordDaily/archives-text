# JERRY TRAUTMAN RETURNING FROM STUDENT MEETING
## 
### 
Student Body President Jerry
Trautman is expected back from
Washington, D.C., next Monday, in
time for Tuesday night's Ex Com
mittee meeting.
He has been attending the con
vention of the National Student Fed
eration of America, nation-wide or
ganization composed of delegates
from approximately 250 universities.
The Federation acts as a "clear
ing house of campus problems." To
facilitate the discussion of the prob
lems, the organization is divided into
a number of groups, each of which
discusses .such problems as athletics,
honor systems, publications, frater
nity, and non-fraternity problems.
In attending the 1933 convention
Trautman continued the custom
which Stanford Student Body Presi
dents have set for the past seven or
eight years.
It was at last year's convention of
this group that Bill Corbus, Stan
ford's ail-American star and Stu
dent Body President, startled the
delegates with his much-quoted
plan to pay football players outright
in place of the present widely-prac
lieed subterfuge of subsidies, and
scholarships.
