# Toro vs. Dekes For Intramural Track Honors
## 
### 
Pinning all hopes on four remain
ing events, challenging Dekes plan
an attack on a six-point El Toro
lead in the intramural track and
field meet, begun early in Decem
ber and scheduled to be completed
next Monday afternoon.
The annual Hall-Row fight has
virtually narrowed down to a duel
between these two.
Toro Leads
The score now stands: El Toro,
26; D.K.E., 20. Other teams, headed
by Roble Hashers and Breakers,
range below 20, and it seems highly
improbable that any of these can
catch the leaders in the only re
maining events.
Broad jump, discus throw, and
220-yard low hurdles finals remain
to be run off, and the relay will
complete the program. Qualifying
heats were held last month in the
low barrier race, and finalists were
chosen in the two field events.
Deke Rclayers Strong
Deke's big chance of capturing
honoi\s in the meet is in the relay.
With three members of the 1932-33
record setting team back—Murphy,
de Brettevillc, and Cotton—teaming
with Kelly, the fraternals are al
most assured of a five-point boost
in their score. Kelly also is entered
in the broad jump.
El Toro will have Stalling and
Marvie Kahn in the low hurdles, be
sides a relay team which shows pos
sibilities of placing well.
Among the outstanding perform
ances in the first installment of the
mural contest was Carlton Thorns'
9.8 seconds completion of the 100-
yard dash to set a new record. The
sprint "find" is an EI Tigre member.
Golfer Sets Mark
Jack Greer, golfing Beta, boosted
himself well over 12 feet to in
stall a new pole vault mark; Jim
Reynolds, competing for Encina IV,
approached Johnny Lyman's shot
put record; and Dave Devlin, Roble
Hashers, splashed through a wet
two-mile in close to 10 minutes 20
seconds, nosing out Rusty March of
El Toro. March, incidentally, con
tributed two seconds and a victory
to the leaders' score, running ail the
distance races.
Hayden Henderson, Kappa Sigma,
looks like a possibility for a triple
win; he is among the leaders in the
low hurdles and broad jump, and
he already claims a high hurdle first
place.
Delta Upsilon's John Beatty added
to the list of outstanding marks
with a javelin heave of 181 feet.
