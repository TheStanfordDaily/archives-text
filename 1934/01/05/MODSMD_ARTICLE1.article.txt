F.R.'s first annual budget message
carried a mighty surprise in the
shape of a seven billion dollar defi
cit-cost so far of financing the "New
Deal." To balance Uncle Sam's
books, 10 billion must be borrowed
by July 1. All this red ink grows
out of so-called "extraordinary" ex
penditures; regular government ex
penses have been met and will con
tinue to be met by incoming
revenue.
Of the colossal sum asked, > six
billion will be shoveled out in an
effort to pull prosperity around the
corner by spending to create work,
jobs, profits; the rest will go to take
care of maturing debts. When and
if the money is raised, U.S. public
debt will be 31 billion—largest ever.
Then F.R. promises to have govern
ment return to normal size, live
within its means.
Increased revenue will supposedly
come from: retention of 3c postage,
escape-proof income tax laws; $2 a
gallon liquor tax.
