# LEVIS TO BEGIN TUESDAY SERIES
## Speaker Authority in Field Of Oriental Music 
### 
"The Music of China" will be the
first program offered by the Com
mittee on Public Exercises in the
' Tuesday Evening Series, for the cur
rent quarter. The speaker will be
music authority John Hazedel Levis,
j whose fascinating lecture - recitals
have gained wide recognition.
This program, to be given, as
| usual, at 7:30 o'clock, Tuesday eve
ning in the Assembly Hall, is similar
to that presented by the Russian
singer, Saveli Walevitch. last quar
ter, and will not only include an ex
planation of the elaborate melodic
science of Chinese music, but will
reveal it through the medium of Mr.
Levis' own singing, and through
such instruments as the Ti-Tze, or
Chinese flute, the Yang Chin, or
Chinese Dulcimer, the So-Na, or
Chinese Oboe, the celebrated Hu-
Chin, or Chinese violin and other
esoteric instruments, unfamiliar to
American audiences.
Mr. Levis' recital is expected to
be more stimulating to the imagi
| nation than technically complete. He
I is said to have the rare merit of
making interesting a subject remote
and abstruse to most of his audi
ences. His task is a difficult oneâ€”to
explain something of the system
whereon the "classic" music of the
Sung and Ming dynasties was de-
I vcloped; to expound the living popu
lar Chinese music of today, and to
1 illustrate them both by song and in
struments.
Born in Shanghai
A British citizen, Mr. Levis' back
ground is partly Russian, party
Arab. He lived in China all his life,
making short excursion trips occa
sionally, to Japan. It was only a
few years ago that he left the shores
; of the Orient for the first time.
