# Beware of Car Thieves, Advise Campus Police
## 
### 
Campus police last night issued a j
warning to campus automobile i
owners to be careful about locking
their cars.
Two cars were stolen yesterday in
Palo Alto and the police fear that
the the thieves may extend their
activities to the campus. Students!
are liable to be neglectful about
locking their cars when parking
around the Quad and they are re
minded to use their keys and thus
prevent possible thefts.
