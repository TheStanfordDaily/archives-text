### 
With A1 Masters slill in Pasadena !
winding up Rose Bowl financial af
fairs, no definite figures could be
secured yesterday on the net profits
resulting from the New Year's game.
Estimates, however, placed Stan- ,
ford's net gain at around $13,000. |
Since only 30-odd thousand fans
braved the elements to attend, total
gate receipts are believed to have
come to about $60,000. Receipts j
were split among Stanford, Colum- ;
bia, and the Tournament of Roses,
with Stanford's expenses amounting
to approximately $7,000.
Unofficial estimates placed Colum
bia's expenses at $25,000, giving the
Lions a net loss of $5,000 for their j
trip West.
