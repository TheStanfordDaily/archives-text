# Needy Students Receive Help from 26 Sources
## 
### CHARLOTTE BURRIDGE 
Students in need of help to con- '
tinue their University work mayi
receive money from 26 different :
sources, it was revealed by a check
of the loan funds apportioned by
Dean of Women Mary Yost and
Dean of Men George B. Culver.
Clothing is also furnished needy i
men students. Through the activity
of the Stanford Mothers' Club, a
complete stock of school clothes is
maintained in the office of the Dean i
of Men. Besides obtaining topcoats,
suits, cords, shoes, stockings, sweat
ers, and underwear for the men, the
Mothers' Club provides for their al
teration and repair.
Help for Women
No similar wardrobe is supplied
for women students, because of lack
of demand for that kind of help.
"If we find a girl in need of
clothing we help her out individu
ally without it seeming quite so
open," explained Dean Yost.

Applicants for men's loan funds
must have been in the University
one quarter prior to their request
for aid, and students staying out of
school for a time must wait one
quarter after returning to the Uni
versity, to meet with the Dean of
Men's approval. A "C" average is
also demanded of the "roughs." No
set set requirements and are main
tained by the Dean of Women's
office. The loans are all given upon
individual merit.
Sonic Exceptions
"Sometimes there are conditions
which make it wise to loan money
the first quarter, and at times when
the student does not have a '"C"
grade average," Miss Yost said.
Cash loans during an academic
year involve the University to the
amount of approximately $16,000.
"No security is demanded for
these loans," stressed Dean Cul
ver. "It is asumeil that the stu
dents are honest until it is proved
otherwise."
j . An emergency fund created last
! year by donations of faculty mem
j bers and friends of the University
, meets the need for immediate short
run loans. Added to the list of
women's loan funds recently are
those of the Roble Club and San
| Francisco Pan-Hellenic Association.
