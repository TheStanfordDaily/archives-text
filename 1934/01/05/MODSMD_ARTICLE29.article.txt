who played a lot of good ball in
Canada, will be unable to play to

Lewis, Bill Warren, and George
Fuller, will make the Redshirt com
bination a constant threat.

important game of their northern
series against the University of
British Columbia, for the "World
Trophy," symbol of the coast col

important game of their northern

that game 10-8 after spotting the
B.C.'s eight points in the first five

Vancouver Rout
Against the Vancouver All-Blacks,
a sort of U.S.C. of rugby that has
not been beaten in twelve games
this season, the Americans took a
22-0 trouncing on a mud field. The
Vancouver Reps, an all-star group
composed of eight All-Blacks and
other, local stars, beat Stanford in
an even-stcvcn game, 9-3. This was
the best game of the series.
Playing Victoria Reps in the last
struggle, the Americans found
themselves fagged out and struck by
injuries. They held Victoria 3-3 in
the first half, and crumpled up later
to lose 17-6.

Minnesota public school children

September.

lineup.
Cards Play in S.F.
Tomorrow the Cardinals will field
two teams in Seals' Stadium, the

Blues. The new men Wylie wants
to place for these games include
Johnny Reisner, Ben Palamountain,
and Chuck White from Tiny Thom
hill's football squad.

Palamountain is an experienced
scrum man who established a repu
tation as a speedy, big and rough
player last year. Coupled with the:
internationalist team forwards of
Roger Hager, George Wyman, Primo
Pinotti, Lee Irelan, Oscar Baer, Pal
amountain will provide the nucleus
for a driving scrum. Jack Walton,
who played a lot of good ball in
Canada, will be unable to play to
morrow because of injuries. '
New Additions
Reisner and White are experi
enced backs, cool and dangerous.
