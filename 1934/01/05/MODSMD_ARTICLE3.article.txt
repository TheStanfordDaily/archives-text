For years bearded, publicity-seek
ing Antartic explorers have sped
merrily over the frozen wastes on
sleds, on planes, never on camels, so
doing they reported hundreds of
thousands of miles of new territory
which they dutifully hopefully
named and claimed for king and
country. Usually they netted titles,
medals for the same.
Yesterday and last week Richard
E. Byrd, ace of U.S. explorers (he
made rear-admiral on the racket),
flew over 200,000 square miles of
iceland staked out by his predeces
sors, discovered it is not land, just
frozen water. Result: Half a dofeen
crowned heads exit from the maps.
