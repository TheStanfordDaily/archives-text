# Us Called Youth
## 
### 
Between the self-consciousness of sixteen and the wi
dening waistline of thirty is a period designated as your
youth. Those that are between Ihese ages represent the
youth of the land to sum up the matter with Brisbanian
clarity.
II is to this group that Secretary Henry Wallace ap
peals to form a youth movement in America. For he real
izes that if a person is not saved at iiO, he is doomed for
eternity. To be doomed for eternity is not pleasant. The
logical assumption is that voting America should save it
self.
Other countries have youth movements. In Germany,
they are a potent factor—standing in the rain yelling sup
port to ideas that were old and discarded even before they
were born. In Italy, they also yell support I —to a slightly
superior cause. In Russia they veil for the support of the
government while in Cuba and points south they yell for
the downfall of the government—any government that is
si an ding.
Obviously, Wallace does not contemplate youth move
ments of Ihese varieties. So that immediately slops all wits
/ who would derive great joy at suggesting pink shirts and
green shorts for America's youth movement.
America too has had youth movements. They usually
move from the sticks to a central convention in New York
and Chicago, pass a resolution condemning war, and then
move right into thick oblivion. That round trip usually is
the extent of their movement.
Obviously, that too is not the kind of youth movement
that Wallace intended.
What Wallace and other liberals hope is that youth
will lake an active and intelligent interest in government.
Whether that activity is manifested in a separate party or
through the present worn channels is immaterial. That
there shall be activity is essential.
When America's chief problem was business, it mat
tered little that politics was left to worn-out lawyers and
penny politicians who lived their lives with but one idea
to lean'on, "(live and get given to." But rugged individual
ism seems clearly in the discard.
The new order is socialized if not socialism. The sphere
of government is all spheres. The importance of govern
ment is on the increase. If it is lo be anything but the over
grown Frankenstein that il now is, it must become intelli
gent. That is fundamental.
II may be presumptive to hope that we the youth can
bring intelligence to government; but at least it is a pos
sibility. And when government is al ils present low intel
lectual ebb (Rolpli, Long, Fish, O'Brien, Caraway, Brook
hart, etc., and those conspicuuos by their very absence)
al the present level, any possibility should be utilized.

grown Frankenstein that il now is, it must become intelli
gent. That is fundamental.
II may be presumptive to hope that we the youth can
bring intelligence to government; but at least it is a pos
sibility. And when government is al ils present low intel
lectual ebb (Rolpli, Long, Fish, O'Brien, Caraway, Brook
hart, etc., and those conspicuuos by their very absence)
al the present level, any possibility should be utilized.
Between the self-consciousness of sixteen and the wi
dening waistline of thirty is a period designated as your
youth. Those that are between Ihese ages represent the
youth of the land to sum up the matter with Brisbanian
clarity.
II is to this group that Secretary Henry Wallace ap
peals to form a youth movement in America. For he real
izes that if a person is not saved at iiO, he is doomed for
eternity. To be doomed for eternity is not pleasant. The
logical assumption is that voting America should save it
self.
Other countries have youth movements. In Germany,
they are a potent factor—standing in the rain yelling sup
port to ideas that were old and discarded even before they
were born. In Italy, they also yell support I —to a slightly
superior cause. In Russia they veil for the support of the
government while in Cuba and points south they yell for
the downfall of the government—any government that is
si an ding.
Obviously, Wallace does not contemplate youth move
ments of Ihese varieties. So that immediately slops all wits
/ who would derive great joy at suggesting pink shirts and
green shorts for America's youth movement.
America too has had youth movements. They usually
move from the sticks to a central convention in New York
and Chicago, pass a resolution condemning war, and then
move right into thick oblivion. That round trip usually is
the extent of their movement.
Obviously, that too is not the kind of youth movement
that Wallace intended.
What Wallace and other liberals hope is that youth
will lake an active and intelligent interest in government.
Whether that activity is manifested in a separate party or
through the present worn channels is immaterial. That
there shall be activity is essential.
When America's chief problem was business, it mat
tered little that politics was left to worn-out lawyers and
penny politicians who lived their lives with but one idea
to lean'on, "(live and get given to." But rugged individual
ism seems clearly in the discard.
The new order is socialized if not socialism. The sphere
of government is all spheres. The importance of govern
ment is on the increase. If it is lo be anything but the over
grown Frankenstein that il now is, it must become intelli
gent. That is fundamental.
