TIIE KENNEL MURDER CASE
(Warner Bros.) At the Varsity
Philo Vance, criminal psychologist
extraordinary, reappears to solve a
murder mystery which involves two
dead men and three assorted dogs.
The plot, taken from the Van Dine
novel, is purely one of scientific
analysis unencumbered by heavy
love interest or weird and horrify
ing atmosphere, but cinema distor
tion cf the plot permits the same
chain of reasoning, which in the
book itself leads to the murderer, to
here lead to a new criminal. Wil
liam Powell, long associated with
the Vance character, adequately
provides the focal point about which
the picture revolves with the rest
of the actors merely playing bits.
Able direction, good sets, clever use
of old but effective tricks, and re
liable performances of Powell, Helen
Vinson, and Eugene Pallatte make
this picture one of the best of the
Van Dine series.
Moonlight and Pretzels is a third
rate musical, patterned after Forty-
Second Street and released shortly
afterwards. It runs approximately
one hour. As usual there are short
subjects. —Place
MR SKITCH (Fox)
At the Stanford Theatre
Mr. Skitch makes up for all of the
Will Rogers' pictures of the last
three years! Practically without a
plot, it is built wholly for laughs,

1 from slap-stick to Rogers' epigrams
i (even to the romantic leads), so that
|it is the most consistently funny
i picture since She Done Him Wrong.
The picture features two new j
discoveries — Florence Desmond and
a clever Rochelle Hudson. Miss Des- 1
: mond, heard before on phonograph
records and recently on the yeast ,
radio program, amazes with her bril- 1
liant impersonations, out-Hepburn- i
! irg Hepburn, mimicing and mock
ing Bankhead, Velez, Pitts, Garbo,
' and Harlow, and moreover being
| teitfificly comic in her straight char
i acterization. Rochelle Hudson, for
merly a sad-eyed beauty of the high
school age, surprises in making some ;
i very funny love scenes.
The story is brief—a family goes
| broke in Missouri, heads for Cali
fornia, and ultimately, through the
; marriage of the daughter to a rich
cadet, emerges rich again in the old
i home town.
; The gags therefore are laid against
the backgrounds of Yellowstone, the j
- Grand Canyon, and Calneva, making
1 the totality a travelog with laughs.
Rogers, using most of his old tricks
' again, is strangely funny, but I think
' cne of the principal things which 1
' makes this picture good is that he is
not so strongly featured as hither- !
tofore. Zazu Pitts is the poorest of
the characters.
There are also a travelog of Scot
land, and non -humorous comedy.
