# Campus Opinion
## UNDER SPREADING BREAD-FRUIT TREE

i Editor's Note: It is when decided
. • *
i campus opinions of the following
variety appear that the Daily takes
special pains to point out that ar-
I tides in this department do not
necessarily reflect editorial opin
ion. After all, we live here too.
The Editor, Sir:
Pardon my steaming off again, but
I just can't resist boobing some of
those statements made by Dr. Wil
bur in yesterday's Daily anent the
Bawl-out.
The reporter initimates that Wil
bur said, "It is more necessary to
i protect the strong than to sympa
thize with the weak.'' That is a
beautiful sentiment, but does Dr.
Wilbur and staff intend to live up
to it? How can one reconcile low
ering our entrance requirements to
nine recommending units and advo
cate a radio publicity campaign and
still be consistent with the above
mentioned platitude? If these new
policies won't lower the University
standards and tend to protect and
sympathize with the weak, pray tell,
v.'hat will it do?
They say the radio broadcasts are
to be for educational purposes. Ed
ucation? What the administration
wants is free publicity with the
hopes that more students will be
lured into an institution that "pro
tects the strong."
This tirade makes me out to be
j an opponent to these new Univer-
I sity policies. Such is not the case,
j Any student, even those with a low
[ Bawl-out rating, can see that the
University is making a desperate
effort to survive through hard times
and that these methods are most
likely to succeed. What I object to
is the two-faced, smugly complacent
attitude of our peers. They won't be
honest with themselves and call a
spade a spade. Honestly, folks, it is
just like a Republican Administra
tion!
I have just suggested that we call
a spade a spade. I too believe we
should learn to face reality. But, I
raise this question: Do grade points
represent "life's realities?" Perhaps
they do for a person proposing to
be a professor. But for the average
college graduate, it. is very doubtful
if the co-relation between grades in
college and success in later life is
sufficiently great to warrant expos
ing one's grade point record to the

general public.
Dean Culver gave us a very keen
analysis of some of the false con
clusions the Bawl-out will lead one
to. Just as soon as Dr. Wilbur
matches the Dean's wits and gives
us an intelligent opinion devoid of
| platitudes will we be willing to lis
j ten to reason.
Sinccrely,
W. A. Roberts.

I sity policies. Such is not the case,
j Any student, even those with a low
[ Bawl-out rating, can see that the
University is making a desperate
effort to survive through hard times
and that these methods are most
likely to succeed. What I object to
is the two-faced, smugly complacent
attitude of our peers. They won't be
honest with themselves and call a
spade a spade. Honestly, folks, it is
just like a Republican Administra
tion!
I have just suggested that we call
a spade a spade. I too believe we
should learn to face reality. But, I
raise this question: Do grade points
represent "life's realities?" Perhaps
they do for a person proposing to
be a professor. But for the average
college graduate, it. is very doubtful
if the co-relation between grades in
college and success in later life is
sufficiently great to warrant expos
ing one's grade point record to the

general public.
Dean Culver gave us a very keen
analysis of some of the false con
clusions the Bawl-out will lead one
to. Just as soon as Dr. Wilbur
matches the Dean's wits and gives
us an intelligent opinion devoid of
| platitudes will we be willing to lis
j ten to reason.

i campus opinions of the following
variety appear that the Daily takes
special pains to point out that ar-

The Editor, Sir:
Pardon my steaming off again, but
I just can't resist boobing some of
those statements made by Dr. Wil
bur in yesterday's Daily anent the
Bawl-out.
The reporter initimates that Wil
bur said, "It is more necessary to
i protect the strong than to sympa
thize with the weak.'' That is a
beautiful sentiment, but does Dr.
Wilbur and staff intend to live up
to it? How can one reconcile low
ering our entrance requirements to
nine recommending units and advo
cate a radio publicity campaign and
still be consistent with the above
mentioned platitude? If these new
policies won't lower the University
standards and tend to protect and
sympathize with the weak, pray tell,
v.'hat will it do?
They say the radio broadcasts are
to be for educational purposes. Ed
ucation? What the administration
wants is free publicity with the
hopes that more students will be
lured into an institution that "pro
tects the strong."
This tirade makes me out to be
j an opponent to these new Univer-
I sity policies. Such is not the case,
