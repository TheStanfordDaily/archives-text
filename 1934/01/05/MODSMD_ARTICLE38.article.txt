# BULL SESSION
## THE 						PLAY'S THE THING 
### 
Yesterday I suggested that the av
erage play selection committee for
the little theatre could, with profit,
exert its energies in a more catho
lic manner. It is my purpose now to
suggest very briefly a few of the
more obvious dramas of established
' merit which seem appropriate and
j suitable for the local scene.
Some of these plays do, to be
sure, demand complex settings and a
considerable wardrobe. But the ex
ertion of some ingenuity in the pre
paration of a unit set togpther with
; a wise use of a well-lighted cyclo
! Rama would overcome the first prob
lem. And because a wardrobe, al
though built slowly, is an inval
uable asset to any acting and pro
ducing group, it seems necessary
only to suggest that this problem
should and could be met by a view
i of the possibilities of modern dress
production, or better, by a consider
ation of the possibility of simplicity
in costuming.
Many of the plays need cutting;
but this demands only a clear and
critical view of the play which is
more than the director's essential
requirement.
To proceed, without further com
ment, to the list, which is amanged
1 chronologically: Shakespeare: "A
Comedy of Errors," "Twelfth Night,"
! "Much Ado About Nothing," "The
Taming of the Shrew," "The Merry
I Wives of Windsor"; Marlowe: "Dr.
Eaustus"; Jonson: "Volpone" or
"The Alchemist"; Massinger: "A
New Way to Pay Old Debts"; Mo
liere: "Les Precieuses Ridicules,"
j "L'Avarp," "Le Medecin Malgre
Lui," "Tartuffe"; Congreve, "Love

for Love"; Farquhar, "The Beaux's
Stratagem"; Shadwell's "Bury Fair"
or "The Squire of Alsatia"; Gay's
"The Beggar's Opera"; Steele: "The
Tender Husband," and "The Lying
Lover"; Lillo's "The London Mer
chant"; Goldsmith's "She Stoops to
Conquer."
In the 19th century the dramatiza -
tions of Dickens' novels might be
contemplated for what merits they
possess, particularly the stage ver
sions of "A Tale of Two Cities."
Similarly, a good adaptation of "The
Three Musketeers" offers a rousing
evening. Late in the century Ibsen
offers "The Lady fiom the S«-'a,"
"Ghosts," and Hedda Gabler." A
| good translation of "Le Voyage de
Monsieur Perriehon" is excellent
simple-minded fun.
Of the modern plays—demanding
royalty—consider: Shaw's "The Dev
il's Disciple," "Captain Brassbound's
Conversion,", "You Never Can Tell."
Galsworthy wrote a good many
plays, few of which have been seen
in the West: "The Foundations" and
, "The Pigeon" are not fine drama
! but do possess considerable merit
while they escape Galsworthy's te
dious and melodramatic social pro
bing. O'Neill's "SS Glencairn" group
might be considered as well.
A final note: The fear any any
thing but the simple in the physical
! staging of a play is indicative of
indolence or lack of invention. The
Palo Alto Community Players have
proved themselves victims of neither
in the matter of settings.. Let them
now contemplate the even more im
portant matter of the selection of
I the plays themselves.
