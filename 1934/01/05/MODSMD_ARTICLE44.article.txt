# CONCERTS BOAST FINANCIAL GAIN, THOMAS IS NEXT
## 
### 
Taking in $337 at the seat sale
of the Teresina performance, the
Concert Series' income up to date
are estimated at $6,333, as compared
to the $4,143 taken in during the
autumn quarter last year. This fig
ure, encouraging though it is, is far
below the necessary $7,200 of the
budget, the cost of the artists being
a $6,000 item, office expenses $1,200.
It is hoped that this figure will be
reached by the end of the season.
John Charles Thomas, famous
baritone who is scheduled as the
next artist on the Concert Series
program, will appear at the Pavi
lion January IS.
Following Thomas' performance,
Walter Gieseking, pianist, and Rosa
Ponselle, soprano, will be presented
by the Concert Series.
Thomas, ranked as one of the out
standing American baritones of the
present day, has been heard fre
quently throughout the United
States for the past several seasons
in concert, opera, and on radio pro
grams. As a guest artist with the
Chicago Civic, Philadelphia, and Los
Angeles Opera Companies, he
achieved notable triumphs, and his
debut at the Metropolitan Opera in
1934 has already been announced.
Second Farm Concert
The coming performance will not
be Thomas' first appearance on the
Stanford campus. In 1932 the Con
cert Scries presented him as guest
artist, and he was very favorably
received. His concert this year is
the only one scheduled for the Bay
region, besides his performance at
the Memorial Opera House in San
Francisco, January 23.
Tickets for this concert will be
put on sale in the near future, and
students are urged to obtain them
early as a quick sell-out is antici
pated.
