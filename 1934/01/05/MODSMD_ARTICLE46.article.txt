# "What We Needâ€”"

Two members of the house, one |
an ex-convict, the other a former i
bartender, yesterday joined to- j
gether to crusade for nickel beer, I
and two-bit a quart whiskey (may j
the good Lord bless 'cm).
Moral aspects were their battle
cry, tho' the house was simultane- j
ously debating the sordid question of
how heavily to tax liquor. Minne- ;
sola's Farmer-Labor man, Shoe- I
maker, with seven months in Lea- ;
venworth to his credit, was battling !
for American womanhood. Mary
-1
land's Palmisano, who dished 'em up !
in a Baltimore saloon at one time, |
was strong for the working man.
Interesting proposition put forth
by Shoemaker: Make whiskey cheap
enough and young girls will lose
their zest for it. All femmes to him
