# PWA Gravy
## 
### 
Yesterday slow, determined Sec.
Ickes dipped into his ample pockets,
came up with 38 million for PWA
projects in most every state. As
usual California came off with the
lion's share; San Francisco got the
most- 12 million for water works,
two million for a sewer system.
Other towns in the state got lesser
sums.
Above allotments are expected to
put 45,000 to work, speed recovery
on its way. S.F.'s money was not all
a gift; U.S. gives 30 per cent, uses
Ihe rest to buy NRA-city bonds,
authorized by citizens at last elec
tion. At any rate, lots of towns arc
happier, more people are working.
