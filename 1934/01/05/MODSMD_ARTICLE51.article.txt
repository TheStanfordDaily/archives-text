# ROTH TELLS PLANS FOR NEW WOMEN'S CENTRALIZED DORM
## Building Allows All Women To Live on Campus 
### 
The plans for the new women's
dormitory are still being completed,
and little but the location and gen
eral plan of the building have been
| finished, Comptroller Almon E. Roth
I said yesterday. The idea in build
j ing the unit is to make it possible
j for all women to live on the cam
pus.
Dorm North of Kohlc
The new dormitory is to be lo-
I cated south and west of the Roble
Gymnasium and north of Roble in
the field that has in the past been
used for hay. It will be built in
four wings, each facing on an inner
j court or patio.
The patio will be twice as large
as that of the Union, and each wing
will house 50 women, making the
whole dormitory a unit of 200. There
will be two centrally located din
ing halls. This, together with four
j small wings, will combine the ad-
I vantages of both a large and a small
I living group.
