# Encina Numbers Swell, New Toasters Installed
## 
### 
Late arrivals are gradually swell
ing the total which three times
: daily graces 'the festive board at
| Encina Commons, favorably com
i paring with last year's seasonal fig
ure but still far below the usual
| winter quarter number.
An added attraction is found in
! dining room seven, where the man-
I agement has installed several toast-
I ers so that the boys can make toast
! for breakfast. The first day of their
[ use, the toasters were very popular,
1 almost causing a stampede for the
favored tables. So far no toast has
been burned, and the scheme will
be continued and expanded if its
| existing popularity and success in
i dining room seven continues.
