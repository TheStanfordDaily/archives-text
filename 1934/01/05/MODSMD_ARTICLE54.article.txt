# SIDELINE SLANTS..
## JUST ONE MORE POST-MORTEM 
### 
Post - mortems on any football j
game, no matter how important it
may have been, probably get some- ,
what tiresome after so long a time. '■
Nevertheless we feel called upon to |
add our it to the reams of copy j
lhat have already found their way ■
off the presses about the New Year's j
game. It's hard to forget in four j
days something that has been bally
hooed by every sports page in the .
country for a solid month.
In the first place we find it difli- j
cult to agree with those who are j
inclined to view the game as an j
utter washout (take it any way you
like) merely because Stanford was
on the wrong end of the score. Con
sidering the much-publicized muck i
lhat coated the floor of the Rose
Bowl, the two teams put on a first
class game of football.
Most critics are agreed that Co
lumbia and Stanford played the
most interesting game seen in the
Rose Bowl since Roy Riegels ran
the wrong way five years ago to j
give Georgia Tech an 8-7 victory !
over California. From the spec- j
tator's point of view it was far !
better than some of the massacres
that S.C. has staged in recent
years.
The honor of the West will prob- j
ably survive despite the fact that i
the Easterners slipped one over for !
a change. And where are those j
gentlemen who criticized Stanford
for picking a soft touch for a pleas
ant New Yeor's afternoon slaughter?
Before they slip into the limbo
(hat shelters all of Stanford's ex- j
gridiron greats, let's have a word |
for the seniors who were forced to
spend most of their time this year
decorating the bench. It must have
been pretty hard for the stars of
1932 like Bill Sim, Jack Hillman,
Bill Bates, Ted Kite, and Kenny Af
flerbaugh to look on from the side- |
lines while Stanford played its first
Rose Bowl game in six years. There ;
haven't been any loud sounds of ;
wailing and gnashing of teeth, how
ever, so we'll have to conclude that )
football teaches a little more than
merely how to smear the opposition
and roll up touchdowns.

j mas vacation and demonstrated that
I they are at least equal to, if not
i better than, last year's exceptionally
I good yearling quintet.—Chappell
