Well, that about takes care of an
overly-long but highly successful
football season, successful despite
whatever gripes there may be about
the New Year's Day loss. It seems
that while the sports scribes were
grinding out yard after yard about
Stanford's football team, Coach John
Blnn and his basketball men were
going quietly about the business of
building a capable quintet for the
rapidly approaching hoop season.
Vacation practice games netted
Stanford a couple of victories at the

the third of the contests played.
Most important, however, is the fact

gregations but they'll be able to
provide the Bears and Trojans with
something more than a mild eve
ning's workout, by the time the sea
son begins.
