# 1934 TRACKMEN BEGIN PRACTICE
## 
### 
With the first of the series of reg
ular Friday intra-squad practice
meets scheduled for this afternoon,
the 1934 Cardinal track aspirants
will start a long preliminary season.
Prospects for the new season are
only fairly good for an Indian team,
as the Cards are considerably weak
ened by the loss of many of last
year's stars, notably Captain Ben
Eastman and Les Hables.
Track fans who have hoped to see
football stars Bob Grayson,. Johnnie
Reisner, Sim Moscrip, and "Bones"
Hamilton flash their speed on the
cinder path will probably be disap
pointed, with these grid aces saving
their legs for rugby and baseball.
However, Carlton Thorns and Mar
tin Baskin, two sophomore transfers
who have covered the hundred in
the 9:7 and 9:8 in the past year or
two brighten the outlook consider
ably.
A1 Blackman leads the candidates
'for the 440 and relay and may also
help out in the 220. Barris, junior
transfer, will probably be within a
couple of strides of Blackman and
may be good for a 48:5 relap lap.
If Reisner goes out for track, the
quarter-mile situation will be
strengthened by his presence. Del
linger and Davis of the 1933 frosh
are other candidates, and Art Rice
! may return to school. Davis, how
i ever, will probably be the best Stan
| ford bet in the 880, having run the
â–  half in very close to two minutes.
| That is, in case Chuck Nimmo, last
| year's sensational frosh, runs only
i the mile. His record of 4:22 in the
! Little Big meet will not soon be
forgotten.
Ollie Amdahl and Art Azevedo
j can be expected to take care of the
| two-mile, even without the help of
j Phil Morentin in the long grind. It
| is doubtful if Morentin will return
1 to school this quarter. Azevedo may
| run the mile also, especially if Nim
imo needs help or Morentin appear?
'in the two-mile. Amdahl and Aze-
I vedo both have prospects of getting
i down around 9:40 in the eight-lap
i run.
Captain Gus Meier, Sam Klop
stick, and Hunt Kingsbury shape up
| as a great trio of hurdlers.
Johnny Lyman and "Slinger"
i Dunn ought to be a world-beating
i pair of weight men this year. Ly
; man has put the shot for the great
; 1.C.4-A. record of 528V2, with Dunn
J holding a mark of 51:11. The "Slin
j ger" got off several throws of from
1 158 to IGO feet last year with the

discus. Lyman is only average in
this event, but Gib Holloway and
George Leedy of last year's frosh
may sail the platter out in the 140's
to collect scattered seconds and
thirds. "Cab" Callaway and Bob
Reynolds, the combination tackles
and weight men, are other prospects.
Callaway will probably toss the ja
velin also, assisting 209-foot Johnny
Mottram, Ernie Arbuckle, and John
Beatty.
Lloyd Schween, who helped raze
(he walls of Troy will be ably as
sisted by Howard "Birdlegs" Arthur
and Don Albertsen in the high
jump. Phil Williams and Paul
Saches have both jumped close to
24 feet in the broad jump. Bud
Deacon will be the main Indian hope
in the pole-vault, supported by
Chuck Jones and Van Ginn. Dea
con rivalled Olympic champion Bill
Miller at 14 feet in 1932, but was
laid up with injuries most of last
season.
