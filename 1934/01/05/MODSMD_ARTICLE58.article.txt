# BILL CORBUS UNKNOWINGLY TURNS INTO MAGAZINE DONOR FOR PRINCETON GRIDMEN
## 
### FRANCES AYRES 
When 22 members of Princeton's
undefeated and untied freshman
football team and their coach, John
Gorman, each receive a year's sub
scription to Time, weekly news
magazine, they can thank Stanford's ;
drop-kicking guard, Bill Corbus.
Indirectly Corbus is responsible
for the unexpected gift which grew
out of a wager between Time and 1
one of its readers, Dean Hill. Think
ing he had caught the ever-accurate
magazine in a mistake, reader Hill
claimed its statement calling Bill
Corbus a' member of Grantland
Rice's 1932 all-American team was
incorrect.
In a letter, saying "smug, red
faced Time is wrong," he confi-

dentaly bet a year's subscription to \
be awarded to members of the
Princeton squad.
Time rose to the occasion with
enthusiasm. Its editors promptly
phoned Grantland Rice, himself,
who confirmed the magazine's state
ment that Corbus had been chosen
as right guard on the all-American j
team of 1932. Result: a $86.25 bill on
reader Hill for 23 subscriptions j
which were received by surprised
Princetonians.
Hill refused to admit defeat in the j
face of Time's proof. In wat ap
peared to be a rather weak excuse,
he replied that the point to his con
troversy was merely technical and
Rice's team was all-America, not
all-American, as Time had put it.
