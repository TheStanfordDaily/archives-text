# FROSH HOOP TEAM TO PLAY TWO S.F. SQUADS THIS WEEK
## Meets Balboa, Galileo Highs Tonight, Tomorrow 
### 
Undefeated, untied, and unap
proached, Habit Eradshaw's frosh
basketball team rolls up the penin
sula tonight and tomorrow night to
meet two of the strongest San Fran
cisco high school quints, Balboa and
Galileo, respectively-
The boys get under way at 6
o'clock, raising the curtain for the
big two - night double - header in
which Stanford and California tangle
with the speed from Utah U. and
the Utah Aggies-
Starting Line-up
The frosh, emerging from the au
tumn finals with no major casualties
li.sted, present a starting line-up of
Howell Turner and Bill Quade at
forwards, Ray Williamson at center,
and Dinty Moore and Artie Zam
lcoh at guards. All five have gone
through at least three years of prep
or industrial competition previously,
all five crave action, and all five
have learned to work together as a
single unit.
In addition, the reserves are all
ex - high school stars themselves,
giving Bradshaw at least fifteen ca
pable men to exert the regulars to
their peak.
Forwards Tall
Quade and Turner, both well over
six feet, are a sweet pair of for
wards, averaging around fifteen
points a game, as well as being able
to handle the ball smoothly. Ray
Williamson and Dale Beedle, a
couple of huge frosh tackles, take
care of the tip-off duties at center,
their size making up for any lack

of the gracefulness of the forwards.
At one guard Dinty Moore is an
ever-potent threat, with his un
canny hook-passing, his work under
the backboard, and his shooting.
Little Zamloch reminds one of ex
varsity captain Tom Cordry with
his snappy fighting tactics and ag
gressive play.
Lost Four Regulars
Galileo, city champion last year,
lost four regulars via the diploma
route, but still retains the services
of Hank Luisetti, the rangy, evrs;i

lili* athlete, one of the best hoop
sters to attend a local prep school
for some years. Bradshaw is build
ing his defense around this boy. but
will also have to contend with a
supporting bunch of rather small
but fast men, graduates of last
year's 130's.
Balboa, an up-and-coming team,
is tonight's opponent, is capable of
giving the yearlings a thorough
workout, as they have lost but one
game so far on their schedule. Gali
leo is as yet undefeated.
