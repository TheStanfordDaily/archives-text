# STANFORD QUINTET PLAYS UTAH FIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO
## Doubleheader to Give Clue Into Strength of 1934 California Team 
### Chuck d'Evelyn 
America's most spectacular style
of basketball, the fast - breaking,
high - scoring play of the Rocky
Mountains, provides the feature of
the week-end sport program when
the Utah Aggies and Utah Univer
sity meet (he Stanford and Cali
fornia varsities in two double-head
ers at (he San Francisco civic audi
torium.
Aside from being the cream of
pre - season competition, the two
games will mark the only appear
ance of the '34 Card five in San
Francisco and will offer fans an op
portunity to pick the winner of the
traditional Bear-Indian League bat
tles of next February, although the
two teams not actually fully
oppose each other.
Card Open Bill
Starting the series, Stanford will
meet the Aggies at 7:30 tonight, and
will immediately precede the Cali
fornia-Utah U. game. On Saturday
night Cal will play play the first, at
same hour, with the Aggies as com
petition, while Stanford will face
Utah U. in the night-cap.
With the close of foofball activi
ties and the eligibility of transfers
finally established, Coach John Bunn
will start a revamped line-up to
night, a combination which he plans
to weld together for the coming
League play. Gorter and Anderson,
forwards; Topping center; Edelen
and Cosgrove, guards, compose the
quintet.
A1 Page will be shoved up in
Cosgrove's place, if the latter does
not succeed in straightening out
scholastic difficulties. Pairing off
with Arne Anderson at forward,
whom Bunn expects to continue the
scoring spree started in the S(.
Mar's win, will be Gorter, Marin
Junior College's all-conference cen
ter of the last season. Aided by
generous height and unusual spring
in his legs, Gorter should prove
valuable under the bucket.
Edelen Shifted
The other major change is the
shift of Captain Hal Edelen to guard,
the post he played during the 1932
season and occasionally last year.
According to Bunn, Edelen shoots
best from the guard position, and
with Topping, third high scorer in
the League last year, in the center
of the court, the Cards should be
ablt> to push the visitox-s in high
scoring, although Utah U. has al
ready run up 76 points in a pre
vious encounter.
Stanford, aided by the experience
of two games last year against Utah
University, v/ill be somewhat fa
miliar with Rocky Mountain style.
During last year's barnstorming
trip to the Mid-west, the Indians
lost the first game 38 - 30, but
matched the furious pace of the
Utah five the second night, followed
the Rocky Mountain schools in
dropping all efforts to maintain a
defense, and squeaked through with
a 41-37 win.
U.C. Flashy
As for Nibs Price's 1934 edition
of the Golden Bear varsity, Stan
lord rooters will do well to watch
the Meek-Eifert combination, which
has flashed in practice games.
''Big Dave," Cal's three-sport man,
has sufficiently i-ecovered from a
knee injury incurred early in the
football season, to take over the
center post. Meek has not only
clicked on offense, both from the
tip-off job and under (he buckc(,
but has also proved a mainstay on
defense.
