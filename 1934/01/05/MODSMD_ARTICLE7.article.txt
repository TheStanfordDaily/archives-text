Good old L.A., largest city in the
universe, was still pulling flood vic-
Tims out of the mud yesterday.
Number one for luck was Hbward
Keogh. an eight-year old Tujungan,
who was found neck deep in mud,
pretty obviously dead. The local
health officer spurted adrenalin in
the lad's heart, up he woke. One
more tally in the census.
Up the lone mountain valleys, well
in city limits, workers still searched
for bodies. Known dead are 42
while 61 are still missing. Political
note: Governor Rolph, famed San
Jose patron, is touring the dis
tressed areas.
