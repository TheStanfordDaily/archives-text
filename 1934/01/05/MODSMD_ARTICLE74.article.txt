# Illinois Students Expelled For Looting Sororities
## 
### 
Even after repeal college students
can't get drunkâ€”well, anyhow, they
can't go around looting sorority
houses and get thrown into local
college town jails.
That is what the Student Disci
pline Committee of the University of
Illinois thought recently, anyway,
when they dismissed three students,
guilty of the above charges. Names
were not disclosed.
