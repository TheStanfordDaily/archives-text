With a 15-game league schedule
I facing them plus a series of practice
; games, the first of which is due
sometime this month, Stanford's dia
mond stars settle down to serious
work Monday.
Small Conference
As was the case last season, the
i conference will be limited to four
; teams, Stanford, U.S.C., California,
and St. Mary's, because of financial
! difficulties facing U.C.L.A., Santa i
! Clara, and San Francisco U, for
j mer members of the league. Five
j games will be played with each con- :
ferenee member rather than three, i
; as was the rule last season, Stan- ;
: tord opening its schedule against
j St. Mary's March 10.
A large group of veterans will ,
greet Coach Harry Wolter Monday j
j afternoon. With the exception of
! shortstop, every position can be
filled by a veteran although such j
I frosh stars as Hamilton, Moscrip,
I and Grayson may break into the
j line-up. Ed Clark, "Hank" Edwards, 1
! or Ed Galbraith will probably fill
i the hole at short left by the gradu- j
j ation of Burt Delmas.
Anderson Back
Fred Heringer and "Lefty" Camp- I
j bell from last year's squad will j
| probably share the starting assign- j
i ments on the mound with Stan An- ;
| derson who was a starter two years i
I ago. Jim Massey will probably open
i at the other end of the battery.
In the infield, Mallatratt and
! Hearn as well as Grayson are avail- I
' able for first, Woolley returns for
j his second year at second base while j
i Trautman, in his third year, has the
I edge over Forsythe. Captain Dick
: Miles heads a large group of out
i fielders made up of Nutting, Mag
i giorra, Nueman, and Walline as well
as Hamilton and Moscrip.
