# DISTANT DRUMS WILL OPEN 1934 CAMPUS SEASON
## Helvenston Calls Tryouts At 7:30 O'clock Tonight In Assembly Hall PLAY OFFERS 17 PARTS Playwright Toteroh Shows Sympathy for West 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
Featuring a new type of campus
production, an unusually large cast,
and a wide variety of parts, Dan
Toteroh's "Distant Drums" has been
chosen as the winter presentation
of the Dramatic Council.
The play is in the nature of a
folk drama, telling the dramatic tale
of a group of pioneers bound for the
unknown Oregon of 1848. In this,
Toteroh, a native Californian, dis
plays his peculiarly keen under
standing of his own West. The play
was given a successful New York
presentation in 1932 by Guthrie Mc-
Clintic, husband of and producer
for Katherine Cornell.
Director Harold Helvenston will
hold first tryouts in the Assembly
Hall tonight, beginning at 7:30
o'clock. As usual, all interested
arc urged to appear, particularly
those with an understanding of
the dialects of the South and Mid
dle West.
Seventeen characters interpret the
drama, ten men and seven women —
all parts which offer excellent op
portunities to their interpreters.
The leading role of Eunice Wolf
hill was enacted in the New York
production by Pauline Lord, holder
of an impressive theatrical record.
The character is that of a sincei—
and sensitive woman who, according
to the author, "had a drop of witch
craft in her."
The other feminine roles are
widely varied, ranging from an
aged grandmother—a fine charac
ter part—to two talkative mem
bers of the expedition—roles which
offer comic possibilities.
Harris Wolfhill is the middle-aged
husband of Eunice, and the leader
of the western-bound pioneers. An
other important character is that c»
Jason Allenby, rebel member of the
group. There are seven other men's
parts, as well as one for a youth of
15 years.
Asks Attendance
Helvenston urges that all may at
tend tonight's tryouts, even though
they may be garbed for subsequent
engagements. He also plans the in
clusion of folksongs for the play's
musical background, and requests
that all interested communicate with
him.
After tonight's session, secondary
tryouts will be held in the Assembly
Hall from 9:30 to 12 o'clock tomor
row morning.
