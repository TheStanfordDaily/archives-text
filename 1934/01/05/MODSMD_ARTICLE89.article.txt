# LOUISE HAHN OPENS EXHIBIT IN GALLERY
## Faculty Wife Holds Show Of Paintings Monday 
### 
An exhibition of portraits by Miss
Louise Hahn was opened yesterday
in the Stanford Art Gallery to the
general public. A reception for in
vited, guests, many of whom were
subjects for her paintings, preceded
the opening.
One of the best of Ihe paintings
is that of Miss Hahn's gardener and
general helper. "Tony" is done in
vivid colors, the most striking thing
about him being his eyes, berserk
in their expression.
Others, perhaps better known than
"Tony" but not better done are those
of Timothy Hopkins, Misses Ena and
Florence Douglass, and Miss Laura
Nelson. The three children of Dr.
and Mrs. Blake C. Wilbur were
beautifully done in pastels.
Frances Brown, wife of Professor
Chapman Brown of the Philosophy
Department, is opening an exhibit
Monday in the Stanford Art Gallery.
Among the paintings is a study of
Stanford's Russian professor, Henry
Lanz, and his wife. Other paintings
numbering 34 complete her display.
