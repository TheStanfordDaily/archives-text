Because Mary Louise Stewart,
member of Executive Committee,
and Walter Bogart, of the Consti
tution Revision Committee, did not
return to school this quarter, Ex
Committee will have to appoint a
new member for each of these two
groups in tomorrow night's meeting.
The successor to Miss Stewart will
serve until the student, body elec
tions in February. Bogart's suc
cessor will serve as a member for
the life of the Revision Committee,
since this group was originally ap
pointed by Executive Committee.
With the appointment of the new
member, the Revision Committee
will start on its official work. Its
labor during autumn quarter was
entirely unofficial and in prepara
tion for official work this quarter,
since the constitution provides for
a revision committee to be ap
pointed only in winter quarter.
Secret meetings will probably con
tinue for a few weeks, however,
since the necessary preliminary
work is yet to be done. The meet
ings will then be thrown open to
students and especially to those be
longing to groups affected by con
stitutional revision.
