# LEVIS TO PLAY CHINESE MUSIC DURING SPEECH
## Lecture Tomorrow Night To Feature Speaker's Own Transcription 
### Will Williams 
When John Hazedel Levis gives ]
his lecture-recital on the "Music of j
China" tomorrow evening at 7:30 j
o'clock in the Assembly Hall, he!
will play his own transcription of j
the earliest music he remembers, a
lullably which his "amah" or Chi- j
nese nurse used to sing him to sleep
with in a Shanghai nursery.
"Bye-oh bebe shi li pu," which
simply means "go to sleep, you
darling," she murmured, and he re
members that her voice was sweet.
She was about 25 then and Mr. Le
vis says that it was the choice of
his amah lhat introduced him to
Chinese music, and it may be that
she is primarily responsible for the
fact that this man, not Chinese at all,
has become possibly the twentieth
century's principal advocate of the
ancient music of China.
System Rediscovered
The ancient music of China dif
fers greatly from the cacaphonous
sounds usually heard, which corre
spond vaguely to modern jazz.
The Chinese system of melody
writing was known as the "P'ing
Tse," according to Mr. Levis, under
which were used, in the main, four
symbols indicating various types of
basic melodic movement, the com
binations of which determine the
structure of the melody. However
incredible it may seem, Ihe entire
first movement (allegro) of the Bee
thoven Symphon No. 5 can be com
pletely rendered in terms of nine
fundamental tone-type combina
tions.
Mr. Levis' lectures explain and
give examples of this classical mu
sic, as well as folk music, using a
! variety of instruments. According
|to reviews by leading Chinese crit
j ics, he is among the first success
| fully to interpret the classic music
of China to the West, and the first
to rediscover the system of govern
ing its structures. This research he
has incorporated in his book, "Fun
damentals of Chinese Melody, Rhy-
I thm and Form as Seen Through
Music. Poems of Ancient China," to
which the distinguished Dr. Lu Liu,
professor of Experimental Phonctics
of the National University of Pe
king, wrote the introduction.
Ming Bell Used
Songs to the accompaniment of
drums and bells of ancient China
are in Mr. Levis' repertoire. An
authentic Ming bronze bell, over 500
years old, is used to accompany a
I song of the same period. There is
i also the Chin, said to be a more
highly developed musical instrument
; than the piano, and a more com
plete medium of musical expres
sion. The court musician, Konei.
j says, "When ye make to resound the
stone melodious, when ye touch the
j lyre that is called Chin, then do
i the ghosts of the ancestors come to
' hear."
