When the mice a r c away, the cats j
will play—contrary to tradition.
While Stanford students frolickcd
through the holidays, the campus
re-echoed with sayings of their
talkative professors who spent vaca
tion propounding pt 1 theories in far
flung lecture halls and before con
ventions being held throughout the
nation.
"Sexuality has become an obses
sion with college women of today,"
said Stanford hygiene consultant Dr.
Elizabeth Whitney before the Amer
ican Student Health Association in
Chicago. At Ihe seme time in St.
Louis, English Professor Margery
Bailey was reading a paper on "The
Life of Johnson by Sir Joshua Rey
nolds" to the Modern Language As
sociation.
And while Historian Ralph H.
Lutz was telling thj American His
torical Association that "dictator
ships are ephemeral in character, I
would forecast the return to other
forms of government"; another
Stanford man, J. S. Davis, on leave
from his duties as director of the
Food Research Institute, was in

Washington expressing strong doubts
as to whether the present agricul
tural program under the A.A.A. will
bring about the necessary parity be
tween agriculture and industry.
Also in St. Louis for the Modern
Language Association conference
were Merrel D. Clubb, English pro
fessor and F. W. Strothmann of the
German Department. Before the Po
etic Form and Esthetics section of
the group, Clubb read a paper on
"Wanted: A Foundling Hospital for
Wit." while Strothmann discussed
"Patristic and Scholastic Tradition
in Lukas Mai's Play, 'Ein Schoen
und neuve Coined ie," before the
Early New High German section.
President Roosevelt came in for
his share of attention from Stanford
professors—in the form of a brick
bat and bouquet. While Lee Emer
son Bassett of the Public Speaking
Department praise d Roosevelt's
speech as being the best example
of the "American" language, finan
cier-Professor George W. Dowry of
the Graduate School of Business
sinned a manifesto in disapproval of
inflation.
