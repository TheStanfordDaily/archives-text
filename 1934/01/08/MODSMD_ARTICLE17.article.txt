# Stanford Sororities Plan Final Rushing Schedules
## 
### 
With two days of the final period
gone by the boards, women's rush
ing continues to distract minds of
both rushees and rushers.
Luncheon and dinner dates will
fill this week, climaxing with pref
erence dinner Thursday night. Fri
day, as is customary, will be ob
served as the period of silence, no
rush affairs being held, and no con
tact between Row and new women
being permitted.
Pledging is to occur Friday night.
New women will receive their bids
from the fraternity lawyer, and be
taken to the houses of their choice.
Sororities will hold open house
after bidding Friday in order to in
troduce their pledges to the campus.
