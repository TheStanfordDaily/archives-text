# Marrying Mdivani
## 
### 
Much - married, money - hound
Prince Alexis Mdivani slunk off a
Frisco-hound train at Reno yester
day, process servers in hot pursuit.
It seems the law is curious about
certain dubious oil ventures of the
brothers Mdivani in sunny Southern
California. Total haul was $.'{4,000.
