# BENET ASSIGNED MAIN ROLE IN DISTANT DRUMS
## Sherman McFedries Will Play Harris Wolfhill, Pioneer Leader FEMININE LEAD UNCAST Tryouts for Completion Of Cast to Be Tonight 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
Following a week-end of intensive
tryouts for all parts, Harold Hel
venston last night announced a par
tial cast for the forthcoming "Dis
tant Drums," Dan Totheroh's drama
of the far West.
James Benet, one of the best
known local thespians, has been
awarded the romantic lead, the role
of Jason Allenby, who not only op
poses the tactics of the leaders of
the Oregon-bound pioneers, but
managers to fall in love with his
wife as well.
Benet's last Assembly Hall ap
pearance was his charming Johnny
Case in last winter's "Holiday," be
fore which lie appeared in "Death
Takes a Holiday." Subsequently, he
has been seen in several Sword and
Sandals readings, notably "The
Critic," "The Play's the Tiling,"
"Richard II," and "Hay Fever," for
which latter he performed the dual
fund ion of actor-director.
Harris Wolfhill, captain of the
trail-blazers, will be played by
Sherman McFedries, new to cam
pus dramatics. A transfer from San
Jose, McFedries made an excellent
impression as the testy David Bliss
in the "Hay Fever" reading. The
role of Wolfhill offers splendid dra
matic possibilities, of which Mc-
Fedries should make a great deai,
if his work at tryouts is an indica
tion.
Dr. Tracy, one of the older and
wiser members of the pioneering ex
peditions, will be played by John
McFarland, while William Drew
will play the character part of the
Reverend Williams. Nathan Pike,
the youngest member of the emi
grant train, will be played by Joe
Chamberlain.
Already cast, though not defi
nitely assigned to roles, are Mary
Louise Dow and Rachael Mayhew.
The remainder of the characters,
including the leading feminine role
of Eunice Wolfhill. will be assigned
tomorrow, says Helvenston, who will
conduct further tryouts tonight in
â™¦he Assembly Hall at 7:15 o'clock at
which the following are asked to
appear:
Jean Adams, Katherine Arthur,
June Birchard, Mina Breaux. Fran
ces Burks, Mary Ellen Eichelberger,
Dot Anne Jackson, Virginia Mar
vin, Shelley Smith, Anne Van Wa
genen, Marian Wctmore, and Mary
Ann Wheeler.
Henry Brill, James Copp, Bill
Gwynn, Frank Hatch, Ronald Kay,
Joe Lav/ry, and Winstead Weaver.
