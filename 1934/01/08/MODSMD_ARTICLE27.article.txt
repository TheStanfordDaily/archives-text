# WHICH REALITY, DOCTOR WILBUR?
## 
### 
Doctor Wilbur is corrccl when he slates tlia.l we must
face reality. For il' we do not face reality, we soon tint I
ourselves riding nightmares al hil>i 1 noon; and that looks
extremely funny.
Hut when Dr. Wilbur faces reality and then says, "llow
do you do, Mr. Bawlout," the Daily is inclined to chalk it
tip to another case of mistaken identity. It is true that the
Bawloul reflects the realily of grades; but that is far dif
ferent from reflecting reality. It is a horse of a different
color; it is a different horse; in fact, it's two different ani
mals.
The Bawlout records how you impress your readers,
how many factual gadgets you can muster in ink during
one hour. Reality would be the education you are acquir
ing. That is assuming that you come here for an educa
tion, and assuming that Stanford is an educational insti
tution. Clearly, the liawlout then cannot register reality.
With President Wilbur's generality that success should
be rewarded, the Daily also agrees. Hut what shall that
reward be? 111 football, the purpose is to win; therefore,
we print scores to fulfill a purpose. People compete on the
Daily to seek positions; we print the results to fulfill the
purpose. Hut surely no one should seek education for
grades.
If grades are handed out as "prize" money after the
fight is over, and if they bear the same relationship to
study as the "purse" does to-a boxing match, then, per
haps, the Bawlout is OK. Hut we always thought that the
re wards of successful study were the fine nuances, that
inner spiritual glow that belong only to the educated man.
And probably to the educated woman too for that matter.
II is the "defect" of education, as of goodness, holiness,
and virtue generally, that its rewards cannot be worn on
one's chest like a block "S." For the Bawlout to attempt
this impossibility is only to make grades the academic god
.-Mid lower education to the level of. the Daily and football.
It is not out of a milk-like sympathy for the "C" sliders
that the Daily advocates abolition of the grade-point col
umn of the Bawloul. That they may gain is only incidental.
We wish only to protect the superior students against their
own ability. The Bawlout acts as an incentive, admitted.
But il acts as a lure on the wrong path, toward grades
primarily; and not toward grades only as they may or may
not result from increased study.
The machine age worships activity and speed hut surely
nol to such an extent that it would favor frenzied move
ment in the wrong direction just because it was frenzied
movement.
And so we must ask ourselves, "Which realily shall we
follow?" Publishing the number of dates, how many dishes
of spinach, and how many bromoseltzers a student has
during a quarter all would reflect a reality of a sort. So
does the publication of grades. The question resolves itself
to: "Which reality should the I'niversitv encourage, Doc
tor Wilbur?"
