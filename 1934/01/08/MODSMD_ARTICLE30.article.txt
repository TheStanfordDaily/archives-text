## IRATE MEETS IRATE; RESULT: IRATE 
### 
Dear "Irate Grad":
Much water has indeed run under
the bridge since the Daily made its
prognostications concerning "soror- '
ity-minded freshmen," and it is evi
dent that some of the v/ater has
splashed upon you. Is it merely
because you are a 'grad" that you
are so bitter? Perhaps we might
explain for your benefit that we are
also a grad, and a lady grad who is
non-sorority, who has not been
rushed and who holds neither ex- j
pectations of, nor desires for such j
privileges.
And yet we have lead your lem- l
on-green vitriolics in amazement. |
We do not wish to wave banners
for sororities, yet we cannot listen
to profane and unprofound pyro
technics in continued silence. Your j
objections to the august Grecians
seem to boil down to their concen- i
tration on personalities, their "petty 1
politics," and their feminine insis- :
tence upon hysterics. We judge that !
you are of the strong (if not silent) 1
sex, by your assumption that a |
shiny nose or an unbecoming hat.
is an unimportant trifle. Dear Grad, 1
you should at your age and re- I
spected status, learn the error of!
your intolerant ways.
To be more serious, will you not
at least grant that sororities have
their place. Could you visualize the !
confusion on the campus if the, what j
is it, one hundred and eighty or so i
sisters were abruptly released from
their fraternal bonds upon an un
protected student body. Could you j
not realize that petty politics and j

[ even hysterics play their part in
! keeping the nervous energy of those
one hundred and eighty girls out of
the much more serious world of
real, masculine campus activities.
Should you care to see the campus
entirely at the mercy of those of
us who are divinely (or something)
inspired to organize, regulate, pro
{mulgate and direct? Your knowl
edge of human nature is weak when
you imply that all deliberate ex
pending of energy must be mis
i placed if it is turned to the business
' of guiding a club of a "sacred bond."
Grant that these sororities cause
[many heart-aches. Grant that they
cause many tears and hair-pullings.
Grant that they disrupt Cap and
Gown, and law school and even
j "high" campus offices. And grant,
by all means, that freshmen and
I others should think twice before
j entering the race.
But remember that the security
[of position, the excitement of lead
ership, the general mill-race of petty
! competition and, above all, the |
depths of disappointment are not to j
be avoided after college. So why 1
I condemn entirely these days of
! training and practice; even "damn 1
it" although that training and prac- j
tice may cause days and months of j
temporary unhappiness. In short, i
' let the Greekesses have their fun
i and let the non-Greekesses consider
the pros and cons without the as
sistance of far too-biased pen and
typewriter pushers. Of which I
j may be one.

Dear "Irate Grad":
Much water has indeed run under
the bridge since the Daily made its
prognostications concerning "soror- '
ity-minded freshmen," and it is evi
dent that some of the v/ater has
splashed upon you. Is it merely
because you are a 'grad" that you
are so bitter? Perhaps we might
explain for your benefit that we are
also a grad, and a lady grad who is
non-sorority, who has not been
rushed and who holds neither ex- j
pectations of, nor desires for such j
privileges.
And yet we have lead your lem- l
on-green vitriolics in amazement. |
We do not wish to wave banners
for sororities, yet we cannot listen
to profane and unprofound pyro
technics in continued silence. Your j
objections to the august Grecians
seem to boil down to their concen- i
tration on personalities, their "petty 1
politics," and their feminine insis- :
tence upon hysterics. We judge that !
you are of the strong (if not silent) 1
sex, by your assumption that a |
shiny nose or an unbecoming hat.
is an unimportant trifle. Dear Grad, 1
you should at your age and re- I
spected status, learn the error of!
your intolerant ways.
To be more serious, will you not
at least grant that sororities have
their place. Could you visualize the !
confusion on the campus if the, what j
is it, one hundred and eighty or so i
sisters were abruptly released from
their fraternal bonds upon an un
protected student body. Could you j
not realize that petty politics and j

[ even hysterics play their part in
! keeping the nervous energy of those
one hundred and eighty girls out of
the much more serious world of
real, masculine campus activities.
Should you care to see the campus
entirely at the mercy of those of
us who are divinely (or something)
inspired to organize, regulate, pro
{mulgate and direct? Your knowl
edge of human nature is weak when
you imply that all deliberate ex
pending of energy must be mis
i placed if it is turned to the business
' of guiding a club of a "sacred bond."
Grant that these sororities cause
[many heart-aches. Grant that they
cause many tears and hair-pullings.
Grant that they disrupt Cap and
Gown, and law school and even
j "high" campus offices. And grant,
by all means, that freshmen and
I others should think twice before
j entering the race.
But remember that the security
[of position, the excitement of lead
ership, the general mill-race of petty
! competition and, above all, the |
depths of disappointment are not to j
be avoided after college. So why 1
I condemn entirely these days of
! training and practice; even "damn 1
it" although that training and prac- j
tice may cause days and months of j
temporary unhappiness. In short, i
' let the Greekesses have their fun
i and let the non-Greekesses consider
the pros and cons without the as
sistance of far too-biased pen and
typewriter pushers. Of which I
j may be one.
