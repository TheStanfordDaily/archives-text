The Editor, Sir:
Dr. Wilbur's opinions concerning
the publication of grade points in
the Bawl-out as reported in this
morning's Daily are very interesting
to me—particularly so, perhaps, be
cause my opinions do not happen to
be in agreement.
In the first place, anyone who has
gone through the mill here at Stan
ford realizes that grade-point aver
ages are no very accurate measure
ment of intellectual achievement,
especially considering the fact that
most of the grading is done by
readers or correctors, who, however
conscientious they may be, are not
comparable to experienced profes
sors or instructors in the validity of
their grading. And, what is more,
experiments conducted here at Stan
ford in which several experienced
men graded the same set of papers
gave such widely divergent results
that one is given good reason to
wonder just what, if anything,
grades represent.
It sounds very nice and it may be
true to say that it is more necessary
to protect the strong than to sym
pathize with the weak, but it would
take a great deal of argument to
convince some of us that publica
tion of grade points in any way pro
tects the strong. It may be true thai
too-numerous, obnoxious, and vain
glorious breed, the grade-hunters,
is afforded some protection by the
publication of grade points, but cer
tainly Dr. Wilbur would not refer
to that weak-mifided bunch as the
"strong." The student who is legi
timately interested in some field of
study does not need to have his
knowledge of his own achievement
bolstered up artificially by the pub
lication of grade points.
True enough, publication of grade
points may act as an external in
centive or stimulus to more study,
but what is study secured by such
means worth? A so-called educa
tional institution that has to rely on
external pressure—the stuffed-club
method—to secure and maintain an
active interest in intellectual work
is not worthy of the name "educa
tional."
To me the only valuable result of
success is the inner satisfaction that
comes from that success. It seems
pretty shallow to use a measuring
stick of grade-point rverages to in
dicate intellectual success. It would
be unfair to imply that most of the
good grades received at Stanford are
the result of grade hunting, but it
is common knowledge that many
are. (One does not expect it to be
otherwise under the grade system.)
It is also common knowledge that
good grades may be—and many are
—secured by the method of rote

memory and last-minute cramming.
High grades received by this method
can hardly be thought to represent
more of lasting value than what is
represented by the slightly lower
grades received by those who have
studied right along during the quar
ter.
Much might be %>aid for abolish
ing all grades, even though Dr. Wil
bur scoffs at that. This, however, is
hardly the place to go into that. And
as long as the grade system is not
abolished, the grade record of each
individual would still be carefully
filed in the Registrar's office in case
of making appointments and so on.
Personally if I were to rely chiefly
on such things as grade-point rat
ings in gaining a true picture of my
fellow students, I would expect to
be badly deceived in many instances.
Grade points do not give much in
dication of whether individual stu
dents have or have not many other
valuable characteristics besides stu
diousness, and their value even in
the last named case is doubtful.
Certainly we should all face facts.
That is an excellent axiom. But
facing facts in no way proves that
those facts are unalterable. One de
sirable result of facing some facts
is to change them in the right di
rection. Certainly publication of
grade points is a stark and unlovely
fact staring us in the face at the
present time, but that does not mean
it must always remain such.

ford realizes that grade-point aver
ages are no very accurate measure
ment of intellectual achievement,
especially considering the fact that
most of the grading is done by
readers or correctors, who, however
conscientious they may be, are not
comparable to experienced profes
sors or instructors in the validity of
their grading. And, what is more,
experiments conducted here at Stan
ford in which several experienced
men graded the same set of papers
gave such widely divergent results
that one is given good reason to
wonder just what, if anything,
grades represent.
It sounds very nice and it may be
true to say that it is more necessary
to protect the strong than to sym
pathize with the weak, but it would
take a great deal of argument to
convince some of us that publica
tion of grade points in any way pro
tects the strong. It may be true thai
too-numerous, obnoxious, and vain
glorious breed, the grade-hunters,
is afforded some protection by the
publication of grade points, but cer
tainly Dr. Wilbur would not refer
to that weak-mifided bunch as the
"strong." The student who is legi
timately interested in some field of
study does not need to have his
knowledge of his own achievement
bolstered up artificially by the pub
lication of grade points.
True enough, publication of grade
points may act as an external in
centive or stimulus to more study,
but what is study secured by such
means worth? A so-called educa

external pressure—the stuffed-club
method—to secure and maintain an
active interest in intellectual work
is not worthy of the name "educa

To me the only valuable result of
success is the inner satisfaction that
comes from that success. It seems
pretty shallow to use a measuring
stick of grade-point rverages to in
dicate intellectual success. It would
be unfair to imply that most of the
good grades received at Stanford are
the result of grade hunting, but it
is common knowledge that many
are. (One does not expect it to be
otherwise under the grade system.)
It is also common knowledge that
good grades may be—and many are
—secured by the method of rote

memory and last-minute cramming.
High grades received by this method
can hardly be thought to represent
more of lasting value than what is
represented by the slightly lower
grades received by those who have
studied right along during the quar
ter.
Much might be %>aid for abolish
ing all grades, even though Dr. Wil
bur scoffs at that. This, however, is
hardly the place to go into that. And
as long as the grade system is not
abolished, the grade record of each
individual would still be carefully
filed in the Registrar's office in case
of making appointments and so on.
Personally if I were to rely chiefly
on such things as grade-point rat
ings in gaining a true picture of my
fellow students, I would expect to
be badly deceived in many instances.
Grade points do not give much in
dication of whether individual stu
dents have or have not many other
valuable characteristics besides stu
diousness, and their value even in
the last named case is doubtful.
Certainly we should all face facts.
That is an excellent axiom. But
facing facts in no way proves that
those facts are unalterable. One de
sirable result of facing some facts
is to change them in the right di
rection. Certainly publication of
grade points is a stark and unlovely
