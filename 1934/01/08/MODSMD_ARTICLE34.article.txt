DESIGN FOR LIVING (Paramount) |
At (lie Stanford Theatre
This is at once a very interesting j
and a very confusing affair. It will
prove especially confusing to those i
who have read the Noel Coward
play from which it was presumably ;
adapted. To those same people it
may prove interesting as a sort of I
curio, as tiie ne plus ultra of what |
the movies can do to a perfectly 1
good stage play.
Those to whom the whole busi
ness is new will find it a highly
entertaining comedy of the type that |
most people please lo call "uncon
ventional." They will find it mainly
well-cast, well-written around sev
eral good situations, and directed
with what have come to be known
as Ernst Lubitsch "touches."
Ben Hecht has done an admirable
job of rewriting the play, but he
slipped up in two or three places.
In the first instance, he left in one
of the lines of the original: "It's
good for our immortal souls." He
also retained the name of the femi
nine lead, Gilda. If Paramount had
wanted to be really shrewd, it could
have filmed the Coward play in the j
original, and then they might have
gone ahead with the present opus j
and called it "Traces of a Design |
for Living" or something like that—
two films from one play.
The situation of three people who
love each other very much is han- ;

died very well indeed by Miriam
Hopkins and the Messrs. March and
Cooper. Miss Hopkins makes Gilda
more human than she appeared in
the Coward script, and hers is a
charming and generally consistent
characterization.
Cooper does well where he is ob
viously miscast, and his taciturn
charm shows up to distinct advan
tage, especially in the earlier se
quences.
March, as the playwright, should
be in his element, but he evinces
less charm and less animation than
is his custom and somewhat less
than the role deserves. His facility
with lines, however, is still remark
able.
Edward Everett Horton is the sur
prise of the show, in a role that has
been much enlarged and of which
he, characteristically, makes a great
deal. One of the highlights is his
scene with Miss Hopkins in which
they discuss "Strump and Eagle
bauer," two of his clients.
In short, one might say of the pic
ture: yes, and no. —Chapin
