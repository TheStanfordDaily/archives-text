# Explode Rumor Eastman Will Go East For Meets
## 
### 
Rumors that Ben Eastman would
journey East to participate in a
number of indoor tsack meets were
last night denied by Ben's former
coach, Dink Templeton. The Stan
ford track mentor said that the
Card's famed middle distance run
ner has not been training for the
alleged invasion of eastern indoor
meets and that these rumors, orig
inating there, were groundless.
Eastman is now enrolled in the
Graduate School of Business, and it
is felt that a discontinuance of his
work there wouid be both imprac
tical and undesirable.
With the warmer weather and the
completion of registration it is ex
pected that today a full squad will
turn out to prepare for the forth
coming season meets. Although no
definite date has been set for the

opening meet of the season, it will
probably take place in three or four
weeks, thus giving the tracksters
plenty of time to get into shape after
vacation lay-offs.
