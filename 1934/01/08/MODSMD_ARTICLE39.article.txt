## 
### 
Stanford's rugby 15 successfully
opened their second season of play
Saturday, knocking over their first
league opponent, the Barbarians,
28-11. Tlie Stanford seconds, abetted
with occasional help from the first-,
string men took the S.F. Blues in
the preliminary by one try, 3-0.
The feature game was more
closely contested than the score in
dicates, with a fleet Stanford back
field and the excellent kicking toe
of Ray Lewis accounting for the Red
margin. Chuck White scored first
after dummy passing to elude his
defense from 25 yards out. Johnny
Reisner had previously carried the
ball into the scoring zone by racing
to the Barb five-yard line where
he was run out of bounds.
Lewis, Wyman Score
Ray Lewis took the conversion
from a difficult line nid made good
to give Stanford five points for the
completed goal. George Wyman,
front ranker, boomed over with a
second try which Lewis again con
verted.
Reisner made the next score oh
the game's most spectacular run.
Playing right wing three quarters,
he came in to take a pass from Cot
ton, cutting back through the en
tire Barbarian pack to the opposiie
side of the field, reversing* across
field again, and then going over for
the score from about midfield. With
another conversion by Lewis, the
score was 15-0 at the half. '
Barbs' Rush Tallies
The Barbs came back in the sec
ond period with a dribbling rush by
Layne and Boike that ended with
the latter scoring a try.
To complete the score Stanford
backs Jack Hillman, Aylett Cotton,
and George Fuller each went over
for a try, with Lewis converting all
but the last, a comparatively easy
kick, and thus gaining high score
honors for the game with 10 points.
The preliminary was pleasing for
Stanford coaches Harry Maloney
and Jim Wylie, who found their
second team holding the S.F. Blues,
reckoned one of the league's stronger
teams, to a standstill in an even
battle. Abbott broke over from a
five-yard scrum near the end of the
first period for the enly try.

field again, and then going over for
the score from about midfield. With
another conversion by Lewis, the
score was 15-0 at the half. '
Barbs' Rush Tallies
The Barbs came back in the sec
ond period with a dribbling rush by
Layne and Boike that ended with
the latter scoring a try.
To complete the score Stanford
backs Jack Hillman, Aylett Cotton,
and George Fuller each went over
for a try, with Lewis converting all
but the last, a comparatively easy
kick, and thus gaining high score
honors for the game with 10 points.
The preliminary was pleasing for
Stanford coaches Harry Maloney
and Jim Wylie, who found their
second team holding the S.F. Blues,
reckoned one of the league's stronger
teams, to a standstill in an even
battle. Abbott broke over from a
five-yard scrum near the end of the
first period for the enly try.
