# LAWSON LITTLE IS NAMED ON WALKER CUP GOLF TEAM
## 
### 
Lawson Little, number one man
of the 1933 Stanford varsity gob" ;
team, has been named on the Walk
er Cup Team which invades Eng
land early in May.
This is the first time that Little
has been named to the team,
which includes America's best
amateur golfers. With Little were
named Johnnie Goodman, open
champion of the United States;
and Johnnie Fisher, prominent
Cincinnati amateur. These were
named the first time by the
United States Golf Association.
Veterans of the team which in
clude Francis Ouimet, Boston;
George Dunlap, Gus Morelan, Jack
West land, and Max Marston of Phil
adelphia.
Little has been prominent in Na
tional for the past several years but
did not reach Walker Cup class un
til this last year when he mashied
his way to the semi-finals of the

National Amateur golf tournament.
This feat along with a great record
in last summer's mid-west tourna
ments, probably earned the team
position for Little more than any
thing else.
The present number one man on
the varsity squad came into the Na
tional limelight at an early age when
he eliminated Johnnie Goodman
from the National Amateur at Peb
ble Beach the year that he elimi
nated Bobby Jones in an 18-hole
match.

Correcting an error of Friday's
paper, the gym class for town and
faculty women will be given Tues
day and Thursday at 10 o'clock, and
the class for children Saturday at
10 o'clock. They are given by Mrs.
Miriam Lewis Reiss.
