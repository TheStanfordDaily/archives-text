## BASKETBALL IMPRESSIONS

Tile Saturday, night basketball
matches at the Civic Auditorium
were offered reiteration to a per
sonal belief that while a close bas
ketball game brings crowd tension
to its highest peak, nothing can be
more dull than an uneven match.
Stanford was as far below Utah
State's class as California was above
Utah University's, and the result
was distinct boredom for at least
one spectator.
Several things were at once ap
parent from the display made by
the Bears and the Cardinals in the
four-game series: California, noted
lor producing big, rough, able teams,
has another such combination this
year, with a great captain in Hal
Eifert and a good mate at forward
with him in Englehard.
Stanford, usually to be counted
on to produce a scrapping team,
lacking in finesse but enjoying rough
going and able to give any of the
Coast Conference teams a trouble
some evening, will be lacking in all
the above qualities except the one
concerning finesse. If Stanford is to
be judged on the basis of its appear
ance in the first 10 minutes of its
play against Utah State (after which
time this observer left the audito
rium for happier pursuits), then
Stanford will not win a single con
ference game this season.
