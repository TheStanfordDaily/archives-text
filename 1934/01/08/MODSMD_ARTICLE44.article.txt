# STANFORD AND THE I.C.A.A.A.A.
## 
### 
A Bay City sport writer has al
ready brought up the question of
Stanford's sending a team to the
I.C.AA.A.A. meet this year, inti
mating that the Rose Bowl fiasco
peremptorily put thumbs down on
the trip. That is new to A1 Masters
and Dink Teinpleton, who declare
that it is much too early in the
season to be deciding on the ad
visability of entering the meet. If
seasonal developments give the B.
A.C. reason to believe Stanford
would stand good chances of win
ning, then probably they will send
a representative squad.
And according to Templeton he
expects to have a small squad of
exceptional men that would prove
an important factor in any meet.
Because the N.C.A.A. competition
will be held in Los Angeles this
year Stanford will undoubtedly be
represented there, but Templeton's
often expressed contempt for the
A.A.U. and its ruling heads will not
prevent him from trying to win
their meet, whether meters, yards,
or axehandles be used as units of
measure.
