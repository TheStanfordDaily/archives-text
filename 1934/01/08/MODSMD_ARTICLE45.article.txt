# RUGBY MEN ENJOY THE GAME
## 
### 
This game of rugby is certainly
gaining a strong foothold in North
ern California and especially right
here at Stanford, where Harry Ma
loney's long labors are finally bear
ing fruits. Saturday Stanford played
two games and v/on them both,
using every man out for the sport.
Contrast this with the long line of
men lingering on the bench at a
Saturday football game. Some of
them spend four years of high
school training, play a little their
freshman year pf college, and then
adorn the bench for the rest of their
athletic life.
Ruggers with a little natural abil
ity learn the fundamentals in a
couple of weeks, spend the rest of
their competition playing and ac
quiring polish. Tommy Roxborough,
the best known rugger in Vancou
ver, who played center three for
the undefeated All-Blacks, was in
his early thirties with 20 years' ex
perience and enjoyment of the game
behind him and getting' better all
the time.
Figure it out, an American foot
ball player if he played every min
ute of every game has less than 30
hours of varsity competition allotted
to him, for which he spends in high
school and college between six and
seven hundred hours of the hardest
kind of work in preparation.
