# Babe Capers Win, Lose in Preliminaries
## 
### 
Showing a lack of their ordinarily
taken - for - granted smooth team
work, passing, and pep, frosh bas
ketballers went down to inglorious
defeat at the hands of Galileo Sat
urday night 34-30, after a ragged
display Friday night, in which the
frosh won over Balboa High, 24-12.
The two games were played at din
ner time, previous to the Cal-Stan
ford-Utah-Utah Aggies battles.
Luisetti Leads
Galileo, ajmed with long Hank
Luisetti, took advantage of all their
opportunities, showed a nice defense,
and sunk all but one of their free
throws, while Bradshaw's men were
trying to form their passing offense.
The first half was fairly even play,
ending in favor of the redshirt babes,
17-14. Then Luisetti began to click,
end in nine minutes had the lead,
29-23.
The final period saw a repetition
of the previous play, with Luisetti
controlling the all-important tip
off, and the babes trying too hard,
often passing too heavily and over
shooting.
11 Points for Turner
Acting Captain Howell Turner, al
though hampered by a bad ankle,
played his usual stellar game and
copped Stanford point honors with
11 tallies Ray Williamson bagged
eight and Bill Quade six.
Bradshaw's charges looked a lit
tle better Friday night, and held the
upper hand throughout. Balboa was
not quite strong enough for the
babes, although the game was fea
tured by defensive play throughout.
Turner was again high point man
with 11 digits, and Moore broke
through with eight.

Alonzo Stagg celebrated his foot
ball debut on the Pacific Coast last
season by recording five victories
and five defeats.
