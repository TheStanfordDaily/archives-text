# FROSH TRACKMEN GOOD IN WEIGHTS, DISTANCE EVENTS
## 
### 
In distances and weights Stanford
will in the future be strong, if pres
ent indications freshman track con
tenders are giving hold true.
Practice for the past month has
been at a standstill, with only one
significant addition being made. Mc-
Curdy, winner of last year's N.C.S.
high school half mile, in 1 minute
58.9 seconds, is that addition, and he
not only will eliminate some wor
ries in the two-lap grind, but he
will make a power-house mile pos
sible.
McCurdy in Relay
Rusty March, Seattle distance and
middle distance trotter, could hold
down a successful position in any of
the longer distances, and McCurdy*;;
presence automatically will . shift
March to the mile, and possibly two
mile. McCurdy may also aid Coach
Eill Ellington's relay team.
The frosh schedule is under con
sideration and probably will be an
nounced within two weeks. The
opening meet will be late in Feb
ruary, Ellington said.
Approached Lyman
Jim Reynolds, who approached
Johnny Lyman's shot-put record in
the intramural meet last month,
gives evidence of making a strong
shot and discus division. He will
be backed up by several other bet
ter-than-average ex-high school
stars.
Heading the other division of the
weight department is Fred Williams
of Olathe, Colo., who has approached
200 feet in the javelin throw.
