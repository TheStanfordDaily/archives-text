# Vlastos Tells Needs Of "Sophisticates"
## 
### 
Dr. Gregory Vlastos addressed a
good-sized audience at 3:30 o'clock
Sunday afternoon in the Stanford
Women's Clubhouse on the subject,
"Religion and the Sophisticate."
He stressed first of all the need
of commitment to God of personal
problems. "The sophisticate," Dr.
Vlostos stated, "is a merging of sev
eral natures in one —religious, pleas
ure-seeking, altruistic, and a multi
tude of other motives constantly
strive for mastery." The sophisticate
tends to respond to a situation by
calling up the particular self which
is the psychological reflex to a given
series of stimuli. Such a tendency
will ultimately result in individ
ualistic disintegration if the person

does not counterbalance it with a '
continuity of uninterrupted relation- |
ship with the Divine.
Dr. Vlastos further stressed the j
need of comradeship, love, and faith '
both toward God and one's fellows, j
and a basic relief in man's capabil- j
ity of being reclaimed by the forces j
of good. He defined faith as the'
belief that the ideals that one served:
would eventually triumph — "faith, I
in short, is living in the future."
The speaker took the position that |
present racial prejudices, suspicions, j
and even economic and social strati- i
fication must one day give way to
the nobler concepts of the universal
brotherhood of man if civilization J
itself were to survive.
