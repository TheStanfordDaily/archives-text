# JERRY TRAUTMAN BACK FROM FIERY STUDENT MEETING
## 
### 
Back to the Farm after attend
ing the convention of the National
Student Federation of America in
which, among other business, a mo
tion for the rejection of the freedom
of the college press was voted down
almost unanimously, Student Body
President Jerry Trautman is ready
to resume student business. The
convention was held in Washington,
D.C., from December 27 to 31.
President Trautman reports that
the Federation transacted much
business, discussed many student
problems, did little of the playing
ordinarily associated with conven
tions.
Trautman Busy
Membership on the executive
committee and leadership of a round
table on "Student Government"
kept Trautman busy, did not give
him time to skate on the ice formed
in the pool between Lincoln Memo
rial and the Washington Monument
by the exceedingly cold weather in
Washington.
Inside, while gay, fun-loving
youth frolicked outside in the snow,
America's student body presidents
discussed such serious problems as
publications, athletics, student self
help in college.
Among the interesting business
discussed was the Negro situation.
A delegation of students from
Howard College made the Negro
problem pertinent to the convention.
Students from the Southern states
objected to the Negro representa
tion. However, the Negroes were in
vited to the grand ball by a large
majority vote of the convention, the
southern delegation leaving the ball
for downtown night clubs.
When a motion was made by
Editor Arnold Beichman of the
Columbia Spectator for a free
college press, a number of the
representatives immediately came
to defense of colleges right to con
trol publications through censor
ship.
The convention also opened way
for students to get substantial re
ductions in traveling costs while
abroad next summer.
Student Matters Only
The threat of involving the con
vention in a discussion of foreign
affairs was averted by the action of
President Trautman, who declared
that Stanford would withdraw from
the convention if the convention did
not confine itself to student prob
lems. President Trautman was sup
ported in his action by a majority
vote for keeping out of foreign en
tanglements.
Among the interesting speakers
who talked to the students were
Speaker of the House H. T. Rainey,
G. F. Zook, U.S. Commissioner of
Education, and Senator Elmer
Thomas of Oklahoma, who spoke on
"Inflation."
While in Washington, the college
presidents visited the White House,
met President F. D Roosevelt.
