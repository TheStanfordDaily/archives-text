# NEWS DIGEST from The United Press
## Green Light 
### 
Supreme Court, acting as switch
man, turned on the green light for
F.R.'s newdealing recovery legis
lation. Curious note, which the au
gust body never loses, came with
intimation that any phase of the
emergency program that stretched
the constitution would be "thumbs
downed."
Actual case was a five-four line
up upholding Minn, mortgage fore
closure moratorium, favoring prin
ciple of emergency treatment for
emergency situations. Chief Justice
Hughes said they "do not create
powers not otherwise contained in
the constitution."
Supreme Court thus carried away
day's Capitol news honors with in
timation that each piece of recovery
legislation will have to stand on its
own feet.
