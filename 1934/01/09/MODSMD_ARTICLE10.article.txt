notably in that of "The Critic."
Virginif Marvin, a newcomer at
the beginning of the year, has been
seen ir only two productions thus

roine's mother in "Arms and the
M?n" and displayed her voice to
effect in the last edition of the
"Gaieties."
Although Wifiiutr Knapp has
thus far made no appearance ■"
any production of the Dramatic
Council, he is well known for his
various characterizations in these
readings. He has been seen in
"An Ideal Husband," "Major Bar
bara," and "Richard II" and played
in a scene from Schnitzler's "Ana
tol" with the Palo Alto Commu
nity Players some time ago.

James Bonet was largely respon
sible for the excellent reading of
"Hay Fever" last quarter, which he
directed and in which he read. He
played the male lead in "Holiday"
and was seen briefly in the earlier
"Death Takes a Holiday."
Henry Brill acted in the Players'
production of "The Critic" as well
