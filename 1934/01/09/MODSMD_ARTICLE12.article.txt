# Sequoia Man Sacrifices Self: Shaves Mustache
## 
### 
Amid lusty cheers and a few sub
dued boos from Sequoia roughs at
the noon meal yesterday the grand
certificate of award for Meritorious
Courage was granted to one of the
club's members.
This presentation for "Colossal
Guts" or the Degree of Chevrolet of
the Academy of Moustache Raisers
and the Shining Moon of the Order
of Sissy-Kissers, First Class, was
made to Robert Everett Moore and
was signed by over 50 of the most
notorious roughs of the clan.
Signers included "Engine Wiper"
Marks, "Rosy Cheeks" Minor, "Gold
(brick" Snares, and "Sludge" Jagow.

The occasions which prompted
this maximum award which was
honestly earned by member Moore
were first, the forcible shaving of
the left side of his "hard grown"
moustache. The forfeiting of this
emblem of masculinity was deemed
an act of high courage.
Secondly, Moore appeared at din
ner the evening of the Roble formal
adorned in a tuxedo and accom
panied by his esteemed girl friend.
Following these unprecedented
breaches of etiquette, the diploma of
award was circulated among a ma
jority of the members of Sequoia
Eating Club for their signatures.
