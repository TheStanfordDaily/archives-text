## Suspension Period Will Be Shortened By Ruling

Farm against students with defi

The idea that a Stanford student
is now allowed to remain school]
although his average has gone be- j
low what was once the "finale" j
mark has been stimulated by the;
revision of the reinstatement rule, j
according to Registrar J. P. Mitchell
yesterday.
Before last spring quarter the i
rule read, "Reinstatement is not
granted until the end of one aca
demic year (three quarters) after
disqualification."
Revision of this rule last spring
provided that a student could be
reinstated the quarter following
disqualification by signing a peti
tion to the Committee on Scholar
ship, announcing that he could
not find useful occupation for the
usual period of disqualification
and that he understood that a
second disqualification would
mean permanent withdrawal from
the University.
The administration, said Registrar
Mitchell, has found that a student
more often than not succeeds after
a three-quarter suspension, and
that this course is the best one for
the student to follow. Scarcity of
"gainful occupations" during the
recent depression, however, im
posed a disadvantage upon the sus
pended student, and rather than let
the studetit waste his time the revi
sion rf the reinstatement was made
ara the second attempt made avail
able to the student immediately
following suspension.
