# Wilbur Explains Value Of New Requirements
## 
### 
Changed entrance requirements,
bemoaned Ihe first of the week by
those who complained that stand
ards were being "lowered," place
emphasis on ihe more important
high school years and amount to the
same standard, says President Pay
Lyman Wilbur.
"We want men who can succeed,"
Dr. Wilbur explained. "And we
judge our success as much by the
number who fail as those who slay
in." He added that the purpose of
the new requirements is to enable
the Registrar's office to judge on
the later years of high school, al a
time when the student is ready for
college.
The development of the junior
high school in California tends to

! make the three senior high school
years the only important ones to be
used in judging university eligibil
ity, Dr. Wilbur explained.
By using only the three last years
of high school work, a closer check
will be kept on those who in former
years allowed their work to slid"
during the senior year and still had
grades sufficienf to admit them to
Stanford, authorities believe. The
intention is to examine the record
when the student is ready to enter
college and not four years before.
New rules require 11 units of rec
ommended work during the last
three years, except when the Apti
tude Test score is above Ihe Stan
ford median, when nine units suf
[ fiit'.
