# Universities Vital in Society, Says Wilbur On Radio Broadcast
## Research Work in Agricultural and Industrial Fields Has Gained Prestige for the Universities In the Economic World of Today 
### 
PRESIDENT RAY LYMAN WILBUR told a Pacific Coast Radio audience
last evening that a university is a vital force in society today when he
inaugurated the weekly Stanford University Hour in a speech delivered
in the San Francisco studio of station KPO.
With the development of the radio, talking picture, high speed presses
and other means of conveying quantities of information to the general

â–º public, Dr. Wilbur pointed out that
| it has become an important function
i of the university to sift out the false
information from that which is true,
to point out that which is significant
| and to act as a guide to those who
want to know the facts.
Research Work
Another factor that has brought
i the welfare of the whole people
I close to the universities has been
the development in agriculture and
I industry in which the universities
; have been instrumental in carrying
' on research and supplying trained
men to carry on the resulting or
j ganization.
Dr. Wilbur made a veiled illu
: sion to the high cost of research,
perhaps for the benefit of radio
| listening philanthropists.
In a more philosophical tone, the
President said, "Primarily the uni
versity is a student-teacher relation
ship. It is the men of experience
j and wisdom guiding the beginner,
' Throughout the history of America
i the principal problem of the uni-
I versity has been the training of stu
dents in basic and liberal thinking
j with a large historical background.
Summarizing his talk in general
terms Dr. Wilbur concluded, "The;
university must not be looked
upon as something on a distant
, hill remote from the practical
problems of the day. As a matter
of fact, it is the most important
safeguard against ignorance, which
is man's worst enemy."
Dr. Wilbur's talk was noticeably
! lacking in the humorous anecdotes
which customarily punctuate his
i talks to Stanford audiences.
Stanford Hour
The program was opened by a
voice which in best radio form an
' nounced, '"This the Stanford Uni
| yersity Hour." Actual duration of
the program is 15 minutes.
Professor Emeritus Bailey Willis
i will speak on "Safety from Earth
quakes" in the second program of
, the series next Monday night at 7:45
! o'clock.
