# ARE YOU TOO DARNED DOCILE?

The bilges I things that seem lo have come out of the
National Student Federation meeting at Washington were
the things that were told TO the delegates, not the things
the delegates did. That is natural.
One of the most interesting things told the students
assembled was that they were "too darned docile"; too
damned docile would have been a better expression except
fhal Federal Commissioner of Education Zook made the
statement and one expects scholarly reserve trom educa
tion comissioners.
Stanford students are docile? easily managed.
Many mistake lethargy for sophistication, impotence
for unconcern, and therefore are docile. It is this class
11 nit frowns on any student who, in the vernacular of these
self-stained blue-bloods, sticks out his "beagle." I hat is
the crowning horror of their lives. In their estimation, it
ranks with mayhem, robbery, and at least second degree
murder.
Many too are docile out of fear, fear of something that
usually does not exist; and if it does exist, is usually too
petty lo consider.
Many more are docile who through congenital inca
pacity, or inveterate laziness, never see any reason to be
anything but docile.
And these arc the leaders that will wrestle with the
problems of tomorrow, get a head-lock on the grafters, and
pin mismanaged society to the canvas. It is to laugh. Or it
is to weep, depending on how hot your morning's coffee is.
Docility is the surest path to success. Look at the cow.
She never causes any trouble, and as a result is fed amply,
housed in winter from the cold, and for all this suffers
nothing but a daily milkingâ€”which if correctly performed
is said to be a relief and not' a hardship at all.
Docility is indeed a virtue in cows. Those that persist
in kicking over milk-pails or smacking milk-maids with
their tails soon find themselves in a Chicago slaughter
house.
Hut collegians .are supposed lo be built of sterner stuff.
We tear into goal-posts with fanatical zeal and undaunted
fui v. Hut vested power, vested practices, and vested ideas
iind us, in the words of Zook, "too darned docile."
