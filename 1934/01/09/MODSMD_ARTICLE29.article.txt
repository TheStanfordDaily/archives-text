# Thin Dimes Cut Utility's Throat

Thumbsore Stanford students, frequently high hatted
by drivers of empty, eampus-bound automobiles at tlie
Paly station, sometimes as a last resort shell out a djme
for bus ride in order to make their classes on schedule.
They thereby ask for an unmerciful gouging of ten cents
one-tenth of a still only slightly inflated dollar.
From the campus postoffiee to the Palo Alto depot is
almost exactly two miles. The hapless passengers are
mulcted at a rale equivalent to five cents a mile, assuming
lhat the average ride is two miles long.
About two college generations ago, when the rough was
still something besides a myth, students used to pay a
nickel a ride. Then the transit company tacked on an extra
cent. Finally it went up to a dime, and there it has re
maincd.
Palo Alto officials have no excuses for leaving the price
at ten cents. With a reduction to a nickel and a little
effective advertising, they could develop the traffic to a
point where it would be a popular habit to use the bus and
eliminate the difficulties of finding parking places—or ac
quiring one of those famous Palo Alto traffic tags.
The transit company does have a book which you can
buy and procure rides for five cents each. But who wants
to be bothered with a commute book for a two-mile ride?
Many of the aforementioned thumbsore populace have
remarked that they would rather be a few minutes late
to a class than have to contribute a dime for I lie ride. How
about getting things down where tliev belong, Mr. Transit
