Large landholder in San Joaquin
Valley, Miller and Lux, Inc., yester
day protested against construction of
votcd-endorsed Central Valley Wa
ter project. Program would seriously
jeopardize their rights, the firm held
in a letter to the state water au
thority.
Letter cited court decisions up
holding certain riparian rights of
200,000 acres along the river. Con
tention was that no surplus water
flows in the San Joaquin, and said
program would destroy property
rights.
Probability is that Miller and Lux
are in the right. Gripe sounds pretty
legitimate.
