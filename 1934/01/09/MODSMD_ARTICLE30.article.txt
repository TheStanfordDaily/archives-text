Wo would like fo have a reporter who unseen and un
heard could llil from counter lo counter of Hie five and ten
((Mil store for I lie next few days.
For we would like 1 an account of the gossip that the
girls behind the counter are indulging in these days. We
think their current reactions would teach more about hu
man nature than a couple of courses in sociology and psy
chology. What do they think about the Woolworth heir
ess, now married to a Prince, whom Ihev work for? (Of
course the Princess doesn't personally soil herself with the
management, but one of her distant relations by marriage
once owned the business, so she gets the profits).
The Princess was met by San Francisco's society leaders
when her private ear arrived in Oakland, and will he
fawned over until Thursday when she s;iils in her IH-room
suite for gay Peiping. When she tires of that, she and the
Prince will go lo one of their homes in Paris, Cairo, or
New York.
We do wish we knew what the girls behind the coun
ter are saying. It would help us decide if a certain pro
fessor is right in predicting a social revolution within a
year.
He probably is wrongs The girls are probably wonder
ing if ('lark Gable will divorce by spring.
