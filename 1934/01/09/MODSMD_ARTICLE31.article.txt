i THE GIRL WITHOUT A ROOM
(Paramount)
1 At the Varsity Theatre
This madcap farce, which inci
dentally has only the slightest con
nection with the title, is a natural
for the inane antics of Charlie Rug
gles and that particular manner of
acting that Charles Farrell does so
nicely (even though you may not
like it).
i The whole thing started when Tom
! Duncan (Farrell), a simple home
boy from Tenn., won an art scholar
ship to Paris with a picture of a
nude girl drawn from imagination.
In Paris he finds his way to the Left
Bank where he is gathered in by a
group or erratic Bohemians who
proceed to relieve him of his schol
arship money. Among the artists is
pretty Marguerite Churchill, who is
a little saner than the rest, and Rug
gles, who is the chief grafter and
laugh producer. Into the plot is in
jected Nada, the super vampire, and
from then on it revolves around
frustrated love of two pairs and ir
resistable Ruggles humor.
Even though The Girl Without a
Room has to scurry around at the
finish to gather in loose ends it is
good fun for all the way through
with, plenty of incidental music and
an occassional spree of rhyming
lines. The highlight of the Ruggles
cavorting is reached when he and
Nada hold a catch-as-catch can
wrestling match in the latter's bed
chamber.
Secorjd picture of the double bill
program is Ruth Chattc-rton in Fe
male, a First National film, a picture
of Miss Drake who by day is the
tix-eless motor magnate and by night
just a woman looking for true love.
The plot is not too new but Miss
Chatterton makes it seem more real
than many others in the past. George
Brent is good as the he-man who
doesn't fall immediately for the
Drake charms. —B Kellogg
