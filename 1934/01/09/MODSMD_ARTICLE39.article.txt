# EIVE VETERANS RETURN TO VARSITY TENNIS TEAM
## Captain Chuck Otis, Law, Lee, Schwayder Net Stars Returning 
### 
Dnmc fortune seems to hover over
tho varsity tennis courts thus far
in the quarter. With five veterans
from last year's tying conference
squad back in schools, prospects for
the '34 season seem bright.
Despite the loss of Joe Coughlin,
not captain and intercollegiate dou
bles champion from last year, as
well a.s Howard Blethen, Jack Cos
grove, and Hugh Butler, there are
left four outstanding net players,
who should go far toward another
Cardinal sweep of the conference
series.
Otis Is Captain
Headed by Chuck Otis, tennis cap
tain for 1934, and with Sammy Lee,
Glen Reed, John Law, and Monty
Schwayder back for varsity play,
there is the nucleus for a smooth
playing outfit.
Some of the individual strength in
ihe number five and six positions
will be gone this year, but smooth
doubles combinations and enough
power to capture the first three
singles encounters against all col
lege competition may be sufficient
to bring the conference crown to
the Farm.
No Coach
Something unusual in the way of
major sports will be the experiment
this season when the Stanford var
sity will have no tennis coach. In
stead of Elwyn Bugge, Chuck Otis
will take charge of the tennis squad,
whip it into shape, and prepare it
for a season of arduous matches
both here and In the south during
the Easter vacation.
An ambitious program of practice
season matches has been planned.
The varsity will meet such teams
as California Tennis Club, Burlin
game Tennis Club, Golden Gate
Park Tennis Club of San Francisco,
and other outstanding net aggrega
tions, in the attempt to develop the
standard of play, and give the Card
netmen enough practice to compete
and win against Southern California
and the Uclans.
S.C. Is Strong
Chief competition this season will
come from the southern section of
the state, where many ranking jun
ior players, and veteran college play
ers will be representing the two
colleges.
Southern California steps into the
favorite spot as likely conference
winner this early in the season, with
Stanford only an outside chance to
grab the title. With Gene Mako,
Jess Millman, Art Castlin in the first
three positions, they ?how strength.
U.C.L.A. Has Tidball
For U.C.L.A., Jack Tidball, na
tionally ranked tennis player, will
be playing his last year, and having
defeated Coughlin last year, will be
strongly favored to win all the num
ber one matches. University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley will have only a
mediocre team, with their outstand
ing men gone by graduation.
In the number one spot for Stan
ford will probably be Chuck Otis,
with Sam Lee in the second singles
position. Johnny Law, sensation
from last year's irosh, may step into
the third spot, with veteran Glen
Reed playing number four. There
will be a scramble for fifth and
sixth places, with Monty Shwayder,
Kelson Davis, and Ray Jadarola as
likely candidates to win out from
the second varsity.
Incidentally, all second varsity
men will be given some opportu
nity to compete in practice matches
this year against, teams from such
colleges as Santa Clara and St.
Mary's.
