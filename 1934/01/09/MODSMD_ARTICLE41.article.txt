# CAGERS COMMENCE FINAL DRILLS FOR CONFERENCE DEBUT
## U.C.L.A. to Be First Game Friday Night 
### 
With a none too impressive set of
practice games completed, Coach
John Bunn's basketball men swing
| into .the strenuous task thi.s>#reek of
: putting on the final touches for their
Pacific Coast Conference debut Fri
day night against U.C.L.A. at Los
Angeles.
Bunn's biggest job will he to se
lect a smooth-working combina
tion that will make the best use
of the new material at his dis
posal. Emil Cowing, a junior col
lege transfer, and Keith Topping,
busy with football until this quar
ter, have only been working out
with the cage team during the
past week hut will probably see
considerable action against the
Bruins.
Cowing showed up well at for
ward against the two Utah teams
while Topping will probably be used
at center. Ernie Anderson and Wytze
Gorter are two more forwards who
are expected to be pretty much in
the limelight from now on. Guard
positions find Captain Hal Edelen,
Jack Cosgrove, A1 Page, and Charley
Rogers battling it out.
Getting off to an early start in
the first few days of December,
U.C.L.A.'s Bruins have quite an
edge over Stanford in the matter of
early season playing experience.
The Southerners made a fairly suc
cessful barnstorming trip into the
Bay region during the latter part of
December, gaining a 55 to 45 victory
over St. Mary's and defeating the
Athen.s Club 33 to 27.
A strong Olympic Club team beat
the Bruins 35-30. Captain Don Pi
per, U.C.L.A.'s sharp-shooting for
ward, was largely responsible for
his team's victory over the Gaels,
whom Stanford beat 34 to 32.

With a none too impressive set of
practice games completed, Coach
John Bunn's basketball men swing
| into .the strenuous task thi.s>#reek of
: putting on the final touches for their
Pacific Coast Conference debut Fri
day night against U.C.L.A. at Los
Angeles.
Bunn's biggest job will he to se
lect a smooth-working combina
tion that will make the best use
of the new material at his dis
posal. Emil Cowing, a junior col
lege transfer, and Keith Topping,
busy with football until this quar
ter, have only been working out
with the cage team during the
past week hut will probably see
considerable action against the
Bruins.
Cowing showed up well at for
ward against the two Utah teams
while Topping will probably be used
at center. Ernie Anderson and Wytze
Gorter are two more forwards who
are expected to be pretty much in
the limelight from now on. Guard
positions find Captain Hal Edelen,
Jack Cosgrove, A1 Page, and Charley
Rogers battling it out.
Getting off to an early start in
the first few days of December,
U.C.L.A.'s Bruins have quite an
edge over Stanford in the matter of
early season playing experience.
The Southerners made a fairly suc
cessful barnstorming trip into the
Bay region during the latter part of
December, gaining a 55 to 45 victory
over St. Mary's and defeating the
Athen.s Club 33 to 27.
A strong Olympic Club team beat
the Bruins 35-30. Captain Don Pi
per, U.C.L.A.'s sharp-shooting for
ward, was largely responsible for
his team's victory over the Gaels,
whom Stanford beat 34 to 32.
