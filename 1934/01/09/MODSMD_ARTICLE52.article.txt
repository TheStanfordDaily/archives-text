# C.W.A. GIVES JOBS TO POTATO STATE STUDENT WORKERS
## 
### 
University of Idaho students came
in for their share of state relief
shortly before Christmas when Gov
ernor Ben Ross announced that
$17,000 of the state's Civil Works
Administration money was to be
spent for student labor on the cam
pus.
The university's quota was set
at .'{.ooo man hours of labor a week
until February 15 at the standard
scale of 55 cents an hour. This
would amount to full time work
for 100 men, four foremen, and
three timekeepers.
News of the $17,000 Christmas
present from Uncle Sam set the
campus in an uproar. Five hundred
men stood in line for hours outside
the employment office to fill out ap
plications when University officials
decided to pro-rate ihe work on an
hour basis among students able to
prove they needed financial as
sistance. A faculty committee cer
tified 356 men as deserving of ap
pointment.
Truckloads of picks, shovels, and
other took went into the work for
the 300 men who passed up Christ
mas at home for the $33 two weeks'
wages. Landscaping of the campus,
repair of roads, and planting of
lawns occupied the time of the
CWA workers.
