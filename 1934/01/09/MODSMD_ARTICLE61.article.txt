# Hit Predicted For Baritone
## 
### 
Expressing the opinion that Uni- !
versity audiences prefer singers
who are "regular fellows," Charles
Wagner, eastern manager of the â– 
artists being presented by this |
year's Concert Series, predicts a
great success for John Charles j
Thomas when he appears at the j
Stanford Pavilion January 18.
Mr. Wagner, who visited the
campus Sunday, said that Thomas
was very responsive to an enthu- |
siastic reception and would prob- )
ably give as many encores as are
called for.
Thomas is not in the least the
"temperamental artist." He makes i
his audiences feel that he is going
to give them a good time, and does
not sing "down" to his public. It is
this quality of good-fellowship that
has made Thomas such a popular
concert artist, as well as his marve- j
lous tone and volume. This is for
tunate, Mr. Wagner feels, as a j
pleasing personality is even more i
essential on the concert stage than J
in opera, where costumes and char- !
acterization help hide a singer's de- !
fets.
Tikets are now on sale for the!
Thomas concert at the Concert Series j
office and at Keeble's in Palo Alto. |

Hazing, discarded at Stanford, is
still a controversial point at the
University of California at Berkeley.
