# Levis, Recitalist on Oriental Melodies, Lectures Tonight
## Tuesday Evening Address To Feature Chinese Music, Harmony 
### Will Williams 
Mr. John Hazedel Levis, lecturer
recitalist, who is to give some ren
derings and explanations of Chinese
music at 7:30 o'clock this evening in
the Assembly Hall, has recently
completed a book on the "Funda
mentals of Chinese Melody, Rhythm
and Form, as seen through the mu
sic poems of Ancient China," which
is published by Henri Vetch at the
French Bookstore, Peiping, China.
Lived in China
Mr. Levis was himself born in
Shanghai. A British citizen, his
background is partly Russian, partly
British, partly Arab. He lived in
China all his life, making short ex
cursion trips occasionally to Japan.
It was only a few years ago that he
left the shores of the Orient for the
first time. He received a Cambridge
degree through tutors and the sys
tem of examinations for British
colonials. From his earliest infancy
he showed a natural interest in and
a gift for music, and his first musi
cal experience was the Chinese
lullaby sung by his amah.
In his contacts in this icountry so
far, he has been shocked and grieved
to find that the few Americans who
have heard any Chinese music
usually consider it abominable. But
he does not blame them for this. It
is his contention that almost all of
the so-called Chinese music which
is heard nowadays, both in China
and elsewhere, corresponds in a
vague way with our jazz.
Dignified Music
The period of this great, dignified
Chinese music, he says, was from
960 to 1280 A.D. In his research, Mr.
Levis found that the composers left
not only the usual musical nota
tions but elaborate instructions for
the performance of their work. He
says that it is futile to try to com
pare it with Occidental music. It is
a subtle music, yet poignantly mov
ing.
If the music of Wagner had been
written 700 years ago, almost for
gotten, and the symbols of its no
tation largely lost; if a scholarly
European musician undertook to ex
plain to Chinese who had never
heard of it what that music had been
in all its glory, and if he could only
do so by quoting a few themes fi'om
Die Walkure, or the rhythmic pat
tern of Liebestod, research
had uncovered nothing else, his task
would be roughly equivalent to Mr.
Levis'.
