# Campus Postoffice Asks Return of Pilfered Flag
## 
### 
Governments balk at con-confor
mance to tradition, but their resent
ment toward correction of their own
misdemeanors is even more bitter.
Startling in the chronicles of the
Farm, was the failure of the Stan
ford University postoffice to take
down the Star-Spangled Banner at
twilight, Friday. Irked by the un
patriotic neglect of federal agents,
some ardent Stanfordite shouldered
the responsibility of removing the
flag; but too completelyâ€”the post
master is still searching for the Stars
and Stripes, and requests that the
Fervent Yankee replace them on the
heights, at dawn, tomorrow.
