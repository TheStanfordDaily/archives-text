## Soviet Market 
### 
Maybe happy clays without infla
tion. Russia looms larger as U.S.'s
big, potential market. Reason: the
new five year, an economic push
that puts F.R.'s recovery to shame,
is on its way; contemplated are tre
mendous expenditures in every
line; necessary will be colossal pur
chases abroad.
U.S. as the biggest manufacturing
nation, Russia's new friend, should
come in for a lion's share if (catch)
she will provide long term credits.
Soviet Ambassador Trovanovsky
showed his papers to Roosevelt yes
terday, will probably start borrow
ing, higgling shortly. New high will
be reached if ultra-conservative
Orge-man Morgan finances the deal.
