The concert of John Charles
I Thomas, scheduled for January 18
at the Pavilion, -has been eagerly
: anticipated by music lovers of the
campus. Thomas, whose perform
unce here two years ago was a high
spot in that year's Concert Series,
has not confined his success to the
United States. He has received tre
j mendous ovations in practically all
of the music centers of Europe.
In the United States he lias sun<j
| with the Chicago, San Francisco
I Los Angeles, and Philadelphia Open

Companies, ond will make his debut |
at the Metropolitan this winter.
Thomas was born in a small town j
in Pennsylvania, the son of a Meth- i
odist minister. When he uncxpcct- :
cdly received a seholuiship at the,
Peabody Conservatory of Music he (
flipped a coin to decide between
music and medicine. Luckily for!
the world-the coin said "music."
Accordingly he pursued this course
and after spending some time in
light opera he advanced to his pres
ent position in the field of grand
opera and concert.
The Thomas concert will be fol- ,
lowed by those of Walter Gciseking,
pianist, and Rosa Ponsclle, soprano.
Tickets for the Thomas performance
are now selling for $1 and $2, and
may be obtained at the Concert Se
ries' office.
