# LEVIS EXPLAINS LIVING POPULAR CHINESE MUSIC
## Relates System Which Gave Rise to Classics Of Ancient Dynasty 
### 
John Hazedel Levis, recital and
discussion of Chinese music, which
took place last night at the Audi
torium, under the auspices of the
Committee on Public Exercises, had
the rare merit of making interesting
a subject remote and obstruse to
most of his audience. His task was
to explain something of the system
whereon the "Classic" music of the
Sung and Ming dynasties was de
veloped; to expound the living pop
ular Chinese music of today afid to
illustrate both by songs and instru
ments.
Strange Music
Selecting compositions which he
had, for the most part, arranged
himself, Levis played on the vari
ous strange-looking, stranger sound
ing instruments arrayed on a table
draped with Chinese tapestries. It
was a muted, poignant, mostly im
plied music which Levis was ex
plaining and, faced with the task of
imparting an idea of a subject truly
encyclopaedic, he showed great dis
crimination in selecting pieces which
stimulated the imagination and
aroused interest, rather than at
tempting to explain the whole of
Chinese music.
Novel Arrangement
Particularly interesting were his
transpositions of the song-cries of>
the Chinese street vendors. A plain
tive series of sliding notes and- shrill
contrasting exclamations, they were
an interesting novelty.
Levis holds the music of the Ori
ent to be move highly developed
than that of the West. But he also
thinks that the ideologies of the two
can be, combined, a belief which he
illustrated with some of his own
compositions. Asked for two cur
tain calls, unusual for Stanford au
diences, he was well received.
