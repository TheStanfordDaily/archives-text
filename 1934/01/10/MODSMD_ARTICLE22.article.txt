# '800' Pledging Will Be Late
## 
### 
With (he largest group on record
at Stanford to be canvassed for bid
ding Friday night, sorority houses
will probably be unable to throw
open their doors for the usual
pledge night inspection before 11
o'clock.
Fraternity lawyer H. G. Hul is to
interview freshmen women and is
sue bids at Roble from 7 until 9
o'clock, after which he will perform
the same duties for the women of
the Union unit.
Since the Union group includes
Mariposa, Elm Cottage, Madrono,
Harker's, Castilleja, Swain's Emer
son's, and the Union proper, it is ex
pected that approximately two hours
will be necessary to conclude bid
ding for this group.
There remain six rushing dates in
the final period, which ends Thurs
day night. Thursday evening's din
ner is not necessarily preference
dinner, either for houses or rushees.
