# Kappas to Build Extension, Says Current Rumor
## 
### 
Will the Kappas build an ex
tension to their house? More
than a rumor, this concession
to the invasion of Stanford's
new women appears to hinge on
the successful negotiation of a
loan through the Board of Trus
tees.
Although members of the so
rority refused to commit them
selves, their alumnae represen
tative, Mrs. A. C. Whitakcr,
said, "We have been consider
ing it," and Assistant Comp
troller Ernest S. Irwin ex
pressed belief that definite
action on the loan would be
taken this week.
