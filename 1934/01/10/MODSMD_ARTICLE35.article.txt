# Fagan Expresses Views On Price Stabilization
## 
### FRANK ORR 
Maintenance of a stable price level i
by one means or another is desir
able, believes Elmer Fagan, alert
Econ department professor, but de
termination of the best method is
difficult due to the many theories i
advanced.
"There are various ways of off- j
.setting fluctuations in the price J
level,"' he explained. "Changing the I
volume of credit, controlling the
amount of money in circulation, and j
varying ihe gold content of the dol- â– 
lar are a few."
Professor Fagan hesitated to ex
press an opinion on the matter,
explaining that Ihe theory of man

aging a price level is one of the
most complex of economics. Each
economist, he commented, has his
own idea of how the work should
be done.
"President Roosevelt's idea is to
get the price level back to about the
192t> point and then peg it there.
This may be done by various
methods.
"The price level will not remain
the same of its own accord," he ex
plained in answer to a question,
"but the purpose is to get the dol
lar back to normal purchasing
power. The prices of certain com
modities will still fluctuate, but the
index will remain the same."
