# THIS GAME CALLED TELEPHONING
## 
### 
Buzz, buzz—who can get the campus operator? And
alter nailing that precious individual, have you heard that
dating dirge, "no trunks open"?
The operator (one regular and many substitutes) is
not to blame. He has nothing to do with it. When you
have the. hardest time getting him, he is working the hard
est to get you. The enigma is complete. The cause of the
diflicultv is that the exchange hoard is not large enough to
handle the volume of calls.
For years, it was large enough. But came the 800, now
soon to be 1,200 —perhaps. Now, we should all be old
enough to face the facts of life, lurid as they may be.
More co-eds mean more dating by the men of the
women. That is fundamental and if is useless to toy with
fundamentals.
More dating means more telephoning. Xow\ nothing is
more tortuously long than a telephone call for a date.
It is this practice of dating, multiplied by the influx of
women, that causes the jam on the switch board every time
you wish to call a .person. The situation is made even
worse, if that were possible, due to the fact that the Toyon
exchange (3121) is also taking care of the "buzzing" of
girls living in the I'nion. The ordinary complexity is made
extraordinarily complicated.
There are several possible remedies: first, abolish wo
men; second, abolish dating; third, enlarge the exchange.
Abolishing women is unnecessary cruelty to women.
Abolishing dating is unnecessary cruelty to both men and
women. The finger of kindness as well as of necessity
points toward an enlarged exchange.
What is the possibility, administration?
