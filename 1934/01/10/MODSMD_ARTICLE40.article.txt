# Campus Calendar & LIN-O-TRYPE
## 
### 
Thofe are two new features in the Daily, which is the
journalistic way of savin#:* "The Daily is pleased to an
nounce ;i brace of blessed events."
The "Campus Calendar" is obvious, and probably fills
;i campus need. Students who wish the time and place of
their meeting published in this column are urged, perhaps
iequested, to have the material ;it the Daily oftice by \
o'clock.
Winstead Weaver's "LIX-O-TRYPE," his armies of hit
ler enemies will say, is also obvious, and fills 110 campus
need. Maybe, they are right; we don't think so at least
not at this date.
At any rate, here the youngsters are, and we wail with
buted breath vour reaction to both of them.
