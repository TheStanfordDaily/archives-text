To (lie Kx (Committee, Sweetest Flowers.
Those who have criticized the Kx Committee in the past
for failing to watch over the students' more intellectual
pursuits, received an answer last night when that body
voted #;">() to make possible another issue of "Stanford Cri
teria," magazine supplement to the Stanford Daily.
The Daily had financed the tirst issue in its entirety but
could not put over another issue financially. There will
be those of course who will say that they slill can't put it
over.
That may or may not he; hut llie Ex Committee has at
least made it possible monetarily speaking. They are to
be congratulated. To them, sweetest flowers.
