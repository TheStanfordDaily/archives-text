# A 						Great Idea, But

A very realistic individual sauntered into the oflicc and
made the very keen proposal that four Roble maidens
might pool their resources and rent a Packard (advt.) for
rushing week. The impression on the sisters as the twelve
cylinders roared into the driveway ;it noontime would be
I remendous.
We bettered his idea, suggested a Hispano-Suisa (advt.).
lie agreed with great enthusiasm. Our friend then lipped
ns with a "Silver Arrow" (advt.).
We might have been going still, except that together,
in a flash of unparalleled brilliance, we remembered that
what was the use of worrying about sororities anyway.
We slopped thinking of automobiles.
