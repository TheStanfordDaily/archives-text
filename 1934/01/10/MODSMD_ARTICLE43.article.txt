The critics continue to insist upon
> finding in the vax-ious plays of Noel
! Coward some moral lesson. Mime
i philosophy, some "motive." This
' latter word is the most frequently
I observed in comment upon Coward.
! Its precise meaning must remain, by
j the modest brevity of the critics,
j obscure. But its implication is
i fairly clear.
What they seek in Coward is what
i they find, as I have already ob
| served, in Barry, Howard, Maugham,
I Galsworthy, Stewait and their co-
I horts. Namely, a problem, plainly
stated and ruthlessly worked out in
the course of the drama.
But we do not search for motives
jin the comedies o r Congreve; the
j important thing there is the wit of
! Mirabell, Valentine, and the rest,
I and the viewpoint from which this
wit Ls expressed; in short, they pre
sent Congreve's attitude. Similarly
(and without any attempt to indi
cate the relative merits of the two
men, which are obviously far from
equal) Amanda and Elyot, Janet
Ebony, and Larita Whittaker are
reflections of Coward's viewpoint.
Both Congreve and Coward have
this, at least, in common: both are
men of the world and both view it
as a spectacle in which intelligence
is invariably surrounded by absurd
persons who represent crassly ma
terial concepts of morality.
In "Easy Virtue," Larita Whittaker
is an intelligent woman faced by a
number of acquired relatives whose
sense of the proprieties is as mate
rial as that of Fondlewife and Gripe.
Coward does not seek to impress
upon his audience any more than
Congreve does, the wisdom of his
heroine's view and the stupidity of
that which the others hold, by
scenes of direct debate or by ser
mons from the characters in the
manner of Sidney Howard. Rather
he employs the infinitely more sub
tle and dramatically more satisfac
tory method of implying all this.
This is not to say that because
Coward does not seek to hammer
home a set point of virtue that his
plays are either immoral or indif
ferent to standards. His viewpoint
is that of a man with very distinct
standards—but standards of intel
ligence and flexible dealing with
life as one finds it.
Thus far is a philsophy of life
and a standard of conduct to be ob
served in his plays. But modern
critics, used to the pointed and in
sistent sermonizing which has pat
tered in the deeper footsteps of Ib
sen, respond to his work in one of
two ways—both wrong: seeking a
heavy point and failing to find it,
they announce that the man is
thaughtless or trivial; or, creating a
point which he does not in the
slightest intend, they announce that
the man is morbid, decadent.

I and the viewpoint from which this
wit Ls expressed; in short, they pre
sent Congreve's attitude. Similarly
(and without any attempt to indi
cate the relative merits of the two
men, which are obviously far from
equal) Amanda and Elyot, Janet
Ebony, and Larita Whittaker are
reflections of Coward's viewpoint.
Both Congreve and Coward have
this, at least, in common: both are
men of the world and both view it
as a spectacle in which intelligence
is invariably surrounded by absurd
persons who represent crassly ma
terial concepts of morality.
In "Easy Virtue," Larita Whittaker
is an intelligent woman faced by a
number of acquired relatives whose
sense of the proprieties is as mate
rial as that of Fondlewife and Gripe.
Coward does not seek to impress
upon his audience any more than
Congreve does, the wisdom of his
heroine's view and the stupidity of
that which the others hold, by
scenes of direct debate or by ser
mons from the characters in the
manner of Sidney Howard. Rather
he employs the infinitely more sub
tle and dramatically more satisfac
tory method of implying all this.
This is not to say that because
Coward does not seek to hammer
home a set point of virtue that his
plays are either immoral or indif
ferent to standards. His viewpoint
is that of a man with very distinct
standards—but standards of intel
ligence and flexible dealing with
life as one finds it.
Thus far is a philsophy of life
and a standard of conduct to be ob
served in his plays. But modern
critics, used to the pointed and in
sistent sermonizing which has pat
tered in the deeper footsteps of Ib
sen, respond to his work in one of
two ways—both wrong: seeking a
heavy point and failing to find it,
they announce that the man is
thaughtless or trivial; or, creating a
point which he does not in the
slightest intend, they announce that
the man is morbid, decadent.
