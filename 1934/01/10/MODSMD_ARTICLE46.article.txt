Can you IMAGINE? MY DEAR,
Women's rushing is here again, and
I am SO excited. I really just
CAN'T BEAR it.
—o —
And they have the nerve to call
the last days after rushing the "Pe
riod of Silence"! •
—o—
Oh boy, I'll bet the "Period of
Silence" would make the noise of
the World War turn green with
envy.
—o—
At least a little pale.
—o —
Living on the Row is something
like playing strip poker—only you
don't get jour clothes hack.
—o—
Don't let the dazzling displays of
the houses fuel you, damsels. Pull
a Faust one on them. Ask to see the
upstairs sometime.
—o—
Now I'm not saying I've seen
such.
—o—
Remember, if the scarlet letter
were reserved for those who tell
falsehoods, the Row would look
like a bowl of alphabet soup.
—o —
Which reminds me, I must have
some lunch.
