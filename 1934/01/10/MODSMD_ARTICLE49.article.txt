' The Editor, Sir:
In a recent Bull Session, Mr. D.
Mellinkoff has condemned the grade
system. I believe something should
; be said in its behalf, and that it
: SHOULD NOT BE ABOLISHED.
Fundamentally, grades are a
! measure of ability. Or why is it that
! the best students, the most intelli
! gent, seem to get the best marks?
, This idea that there is a distinction
l between "pure memorizing" and
i "actual learning"; that a student can
i memorize the facts of a course!
I achieve an A, and still not know
I any more about the course than
I when he started, is the bunk. Blue
! books aren't all filled with such data
| as, "Regina is the capital of Saskat
j chewan," etc. Practically all econ
J exams require extensive brainwork.
Mellinkoff's first "con" argument
; stating the fact that everyone must
jbe educated nowadays, just as
leveryone must have a Ford, is
| wrong, will I believe, find little op
j position. " But what does this have
! to do with the grade system? Here
accepting the fact that grades are a
measure of ability, Mr. Mellinkoff's
own point then, is proved by the
' grade system. A D given an engi
neer in a certain course will show
] that he is unfit in this line.
The second contention, "the Uni-
I versity must drive the student to
I study," is stated wrong. It should
be: the University shall report on
the measurement of learning accom
plishment by the student. Stanford
is not the governess, nor the guard
ian. It is merely the informant. The
disciplinary measures take shape in
the home of one student. With an
i other, his conscience and will-power
i do the work.
The third point, "Grades become
| a goal," might be the only excuse

for abolishing the system. Granted,
that a skillful .student may be judged
smart simply because he has
crammed, and that there are other
subtle and more artful methof
obtaining A's with a minimum of
learning. However, if the individual
is really earnest in obtaining an ed
ucation, grades won't mean a par
ticle to him. He would, 10 to 1, get
at least a B in his course anyway,
because he knows it thoroughly.
Were the system abolished, we
would have no exams whatsoever,
no papers to write, and no assign
ments to cover. Paradise to many,
but only on paper. Study and at
tendance would be optional, and the
amount learned from reading would
be entirely up to the individual.
Which leads to: Why not learn and
study the encyclopedia from 1 to in
dex? If so, one could have one of
the best minds in the country. But
this method seems a bit arid.
In various institutions the purpose
of the grade system vary. Its put
poses at Stanford are not widely
known. But the fact .should be self
evident, tljat as an incentive to
learning, it is supreme.

smart simply because he has
crammed, and that there are other
subtle and more artful methof
obtaining A's with a minimum of
learning. However, if the individual
is really earnest in obtaining an ed
ucation, grades won't mean a par
ticle to him. He would, 10 to 1, get
at least a B in his course anyway,
because he knows it thoroughly.
Were the system abolished, we
would have no exams whatsoever,
no papers to write, and no assign
ments to cover. Paradise to many,
but only on paper. Study and at
tendance would be optional, and the
amount learned from reading would
be entirely up to the individual.
Which leads to: Why not learn and
study the encyclopedia from 1 to in
dex? If so, one could have one of
the best minds in the country. But
this method seems a bit arid.
In various institutions the purpose
of the grade system vary. Its put
poses at Stanford are not widely

evident, tljat as an incentive to
learning, it is supreme.
