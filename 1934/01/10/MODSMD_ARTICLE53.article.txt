# FROM FOOTBALL, THEY TURN TO RUGBY
## 
### 
Not so many days back these
unctuous gentlemen of the sourball
variety (this is not directed at any
personality, but the system of stric
tures as a whole) got up from their
haunches and told a voung man who
was desperately trying to find a lit
tle enjoyment in life, and in spite
of all the gew-gaws attendant to
playing football in a university tearp,
was playing football, that he might
turn in his suit and forget that he
ever wanted to smash an off-tackle
drive.
And now by the same token, this
brand of spoil sport is investigating
the realm of rugby football, drawn
on, no doubt, by the reports current
that rugby players have more pure
enjoyment and sport than any other
of our present types of athletes.
Last year, when rugby football
was an unstable infant on the Farm,
anybody and everybody was wel
come to play. Now, after some pub
licity, and interest on the part of
the general public, the authorities
step forward and tell the luggers
that they must perform according to
the established formula—and that
freshmen must not be sullied by
and graduates must not sully, the
sophomores, juniors, and seniors of
Stanford University by appearing
with them on the rugby field.
Ah, it won't be long now, until
the authorities will have rugger well
clamped down to the old conven
tions, with participation a patriotic
duty rather than an irregular pleas
ure.
