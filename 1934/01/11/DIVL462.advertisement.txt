The manly art
of self-defense
. . . novo applied to telephone cable
Western Electric, manufacturing unit of the
Bell System, now makes a tape armored telephone
cable ready to meet all comers. When laid directly
in the ground, this cable defends itself against
moisture, grit, corrosion and other enemies.
Besides the usual lead sheath, the tiny copper
wires in the cable are guarded by seven layers of
paper, jute and steel tape â€”all saturated or covered
with asphalt compound.
In pioneering and producing improved appa
ratus, Western Electric contributes to the year
'round reliability of your Bell Telephone.
