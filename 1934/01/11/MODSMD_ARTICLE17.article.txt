that no campus organization may
bold an off-campus dance more
often than once every tw> years,
and in any case must have ap
proval from the proper officcs. If
this rule is to be applied, then the
customary festivities ill San Fran

reserved until tonight's council
meeting, after house presidents
have conferred with their groups.
"All the fraternities are willing
and only too glad to comply with
any University rule," said Chair
man Donn Tatum last night, "and
tomorrow night's meeting will be
for the purpose of working this
thing out in a fair manner."
Often Dodged
The no-party regulation is often
evaded by groups by giving parties
