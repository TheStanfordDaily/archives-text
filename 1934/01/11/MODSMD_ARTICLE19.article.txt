"The play really only ran three
end a half weeks in New York," ex
plains Joan, "and I left after the
second week. II was work, but I
loved it." Charlotte Henry, much

study, replaced her for the re
mainder o," the engagement.
Reviews were for the great ma
jority highly enthusiastic. One of
the prized clippings in one of the

Too Much to Learn

si ills, and hair tests that first week,
that I thought I'd never finish!" ex
claims Jean. "Then I had to learn
swimming, and diving under Mar

from the picture."
