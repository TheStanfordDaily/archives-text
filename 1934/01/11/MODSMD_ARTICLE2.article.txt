# Milk off Streets
## 
### 
Washington's AAA butted into
Chicago milk strike yesterday,
threatened to put milk dealers un
der a system of licensing. Truce
was arrived at in mayor's office.
Milk is once more pouring down
thirsty throats rather than the Chi
cago river and road-side ditches.
Matter of producers' price, which
started the whole rumpus, will be
settled by arbitration between deal
ers and farmers.
