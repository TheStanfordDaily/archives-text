# CAMPUS PHONE SERVICE STIRS WIDE COMMENT
## Women Housed in Union Cause Complications On Switchboard ERWIN GIVES OPINION Rush Hours Come At Lunch And Dinner Times 
### 
Reviving the Stanford telephone
controversy, yesterday morning':;
Daily opened up the switch board
problem originated last quarter with
ihe moving of approximately eighty
women ini o the Union.
The Toyon switchboard with only
ten trunk lines was originally in
tended for only Branner and Toyon.
Encina was next wired into the sys
tem, and finally the Union. The real
difficulty, however, did not become
apparent until the influx of "300"
complicated rooming situations.
Union Line Busy
More calls go to the Union now
than to the other three halls com
bined, according to Biil Morse,
switchboard worker. The present,
telephone hookup, apparently satis
factory. duvjng most of the hours of
ihe day, is incapable of handling the
great number of calls which arc
made during the lunch and dinner
hours. From 12 to 1 o'clock at noon
and from G to 8 o'clock in the eve
ning students find there is much
eeiay in getting calls through.
Asked about the situation, As
sistant Comptroller Ernest E. Er
win said he; believed the service
could be improved without the
addition of more trunk lines which
would cause a large expense. A
study is now being tarried on by
the telephone company to deter
mine thÂ«' best method of better
ing the phoning conditions, he ex
plained.
Refusing to make any definite
statement as to the exact need of a
new systen or the probability of
such a project, until looking into
the matter more carefully, Erwin
said, "I believe the things will level
off and '"miction properly."
Complicated System
Much of the present trouble he
indicated is coming from the fact,
that in order for Union women to be
summoned to the lobby of the Union,
it i 1 ; necessary for the operator there
to call the Toyon exchange board
te have ihe particular room notified
bj means of the buzzer system.
Erwin further said that it. would
be impossible to have enough trunk
lines in the switchboard to take care
ni all of (he calls which come in
during the rush hours. He, how
ever, promised to give special study
to this telephone problem, and re
port what could be done in way of
improvement.
