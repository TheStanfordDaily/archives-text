# REPUBLICANS FACE THE FUTURE
## 
### 
Only the most wild-evcd Now Dealers would deny to
liic Republicans the hare right of existence as a national
political party. J>nt though Hiey have the right to exist, the
(1.0.1', is not exercising its right.
The Republicans are not completely dead; they are
merely hibernating waiting a radical change in the public
sentiment. And if the New Deal wins, they may have a
nice long sleep.
There are two classes of live Republicans today: those
Unit arc waiting for the "call" from the people, and those
who are filling the air with meaningless bellowing against
the Democrats. These old time politicians are throwing
themselves against the heavy guns of the foe with the reck
less abandon of "The Light Brigade" with about that
much result, and without a Tennyson to immortalize them.
Needless to say, the roaring waves of the New Deal swal
low them up like miserable little hard-shelled crabs at the
seashore.

If the Republicans had an idea, their position wouldn't
be so pitiful; but they haven't. They have not one principle
that they can otter the people.
They would attack Roosevelt's expenditures, but that
would be suicide with the folks at home who are ever
eager to keep theb' mouths open and poised high to catch
the money that rains out of Washington like the manna
of old.
They could attack Roosevelt's liquor policy, but all the
drys have put on skirts and joined the W.C.T.I 1 .
They could attack inflation, but the Republicans, like
everyone else, don't know what it is all about; and some
of the loudest inflationists are in their own party.
They could attack the codification of industry, but they
don't know whether it will work or not; and as a result
they cannot make up their minds as to whether codes are
"bolshevistic" or "American" until their success or failure
is determined.
S(C * *
In short, the Republicans are an oposition party only
in name. They are what the Democrats were during the
last two years of the Hoover presidency. They can hope to
obstruct; but they can do that only if they carry Congress.
Meanwhile, suspended animation.
They have no principles upon which they can launch
an effective attack. They can only be opportunists; and
that is an unpleasant fate at present.
For they face an administration which is political and
intelligent. By their intelligence, they arc drawing liberal
support. By their politics, and there are jobs for all, they
are drawing such strength that intelligence could not touch.
After all, what do "deserving" postmasters know or care
about "a planned economy"? They can't define the terms.
The Republican future is dreary; so dreary that the
arch-Republican Saturday Evening Post has advocated the
abolition of the Republican party in a last endeavor to
forge some better anti-Roosevelt weapon.

They could attack inflation, but the Republicans, like
everyone else, don't know what it is all about; and some

They could attack the codification of industry, but they
don't know whether it will work or not; and as a result

In short, the Republicans are an oposition party only
in name. They are what the Democrats were during the
last two years of the Hoover presidency. They can hope to
obstruct; but they can do that only if they carry Congress.
Meanwhile, suspended animation.
They have no principles upon which they can launch
an effective attack. They can only be opportunists; and
that is an unpleasant fate at present.
For they face an administration which is political and
intelligent. By their intelligence, they arc drawing liberal
support. By their politics, and there are jobs for all, they
are drawing such strength that intelligence could not touch.
After all, what do "deserving" postmasters know or care
about "a planned economy"? They can't define the terms.
The Republican future is dreary; so dreary that the
arch-Republican Saturday Evening Post has advocated the
abolition of the Republican party in a last endeavor to
forge some better anti-Roosevelt weapon.
Only the most wild-evcd Now Dealers would deny to
liic Republicans the hare right of existence as a national
political party. J>nt though Hiey have the right to exist, the
(1.0.1', is not exercising its right.
The Republicans are not completely dead; they are
merely hibernating waiting a radical change in the public
sentiment. And if the New Deal wins, they may have a
nice long sleep.
There are two classes of live Republicans today: those
Unit arc waiting for the "call" from the people, and those
who are filling the air with meaningless bellowing against
the Democrats. These old time politicians are throwing
themselves against the heavy guns of the foe with the reck
less abandon of "The Light Brigade" with about that
much result, and without a Tennyson to immortalize them.
Needless to say, the roaring waves of the New Deal swal
low them up like miserable little hard-shelled crabs at the
seashore.

If the Republicans had an idea, their position wouldn't
be so pitiful; but they haven't. They have not one principle
that they can otter the people.
They would attack Roosevelt's expenditures, but that
would be suicide with the folks at home who are ever
eager to keep theb' mouths open and poised high to catch
the money that rains out of Washington like the manna
of old.
They could attack Roosevelt's liquor policy, but all the
drys have put on skirts and joined the W.C.T.I 1 .
They could attack inflation, but the Republicans, like
everyone else, don't know what it is all about; and some
of the loudest inflationists are in their own party.
