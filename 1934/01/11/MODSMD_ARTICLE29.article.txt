Some lime today, barring mishaps, the six huge United
Stales Navy seaplanes which left San Francisco yesterday
afternoon will drone over Honolulu, circle the city, and
gracefully alight on Hawaiian waters lo complete the
"transfer of the squadron to its new base."
Probably tomorrow morning the Hearst papers will
break forth with the information that "If our planes can
go lo Honolulu in one jump, Japan's airships can flv here
in the same time. Let us arm ourselves against the Yellow
Menace."

of the Seer of San Simeon, probably Japan's press will
contain statements similar to those which are likely to
appear in the American chain.

inusl be. Hut why, Mr. Hearst, should you repeatedly make
mention of war with Japan? Could you be reverting lo
your tactics of IK9B, when you sent a message to your spe
cially delegated artist in Cuba which syid, "You furnish
llie pictures, and I'll furnish the war"?
