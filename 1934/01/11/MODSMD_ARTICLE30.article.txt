The second issue of the Stanfohd Gbiteria will make
its appearance toward the end of this month.
Articles are in demand. The supplement is more than
an attempted erudite exposition of minor literary points.
Fiction, poetry are of course in demand.
Hut further than that, articles on current subjects deal
ing with economics, politics, history in fact practically
anything but sex in its more brutal aspects- are welcome.

(ireat changes are coining and going so fast that only the
more startling earn more than passing notice. Articles on
both sides of these questions are acceptable articles on
all three sides of any question are acceptable. Write now.
