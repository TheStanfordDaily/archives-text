# BULL SESSION
## IN BRAINS WE TRUST 
### 
It is now about ten months since
the American electorate, faced with
crashing market and diminishing
employment, voted its disapproval of
the wild waves rocking the Ship of
State.
The vote was not definitely for
"the conservation expert" from the
slate of New York, nor against "the
great engineer" from the alfalfa and
Ccts of the Stanford Farm. The voice
of the people was the sickened groan
of a bilious patient.
Now as the miasma begins to clear
away, some are beginning to ask:
What have we done?
It is clear that 1932 was no ordi
r:ai-y election year. After the froth
of repeal and campaign oratoi-y, the
country is beginning to realize that
in that—as in all elections—it was
fooled. Voters had pawned off on
them a lump of pure metal—instead
of the gold bricks to which they had
been accustomed. The Roosevelt
landslide brought into Washington
not only the packs of good Demo
cratic wolves which everyone had
expected, but a philosophy—such as
never before had graced the capital
city.
It is also clear that this claret phi- i
losophy is not just a blues chaser,
but the preferred vintage of the new
administration.
To many this is satisfactory. A
survey of the wants which the New j
Deal has thus far satisfied would i
rf.ad, from left to right: Communists ;
have bombed and soapboxed for i
recognition—and they have it. So- |
cialists have screamed for govern- j
mental regulation of industry—and
they have got it. Professor have ha- <
rangucd for more theory in govern
ment —and we have it. Wets sue- !
ceeded in substituting "How Dry I j
Am" for the national anthem—and j
now they are happy. Such is the j
rew deal.
With nearly all major American j
traditions doing flip-flops around 1
+ he Washington monument, no one j
can help but become at least faintly j
interested. The period is one of in- !
terest in the government—which
is perhaps a good thing. Everyone ■
has an interpretation, and no two'

I groups can agree on the results and
i benefits or evils of the tide of events.

It is now about ten months since
the American electorate, faced with
crashing market and diminishing
employment, voted its disapproval of
the wild waves rocking the Ship of
State.
The vote was not definitely for
"the conservation expert" from the
slate of New York, nor against "the
great engineer" from the alfalfa and
Ccts of the Stanford Farm. The voice
of the people was the sickened groan
of a bilious patient.
Now as the miasma begins to clear
away, some are beginning to ask:
What have we done?
It is clear that 1932 was no ordi
r:ai-y election year. After the froth
of repeal and campaign oratoi-y, the
country is beginning to realize that
in that—as in all elections—it was
fooled. Voters had pawned off on
them a lump of pure metal—instead
of the gold bricks to which they had
been accustomed. The Roosevelt
landslide brought into Washington
not only the packs of good Demo
cratic wolves which everyone had
expected, but a philosophy—such as
never before had graced the capital
city.
It is also clear that this claret phi- i
losophy is not just a blues chaser,
but the preferred vintage of the new
administration.
To many this is satisfactory. A
survey of the wants which the New j
Deal has thus far satisfied would i
rf.ad, from left to right: Communists ;
have bombed and soapboxed for i
recognition—and they have it. So- |
cialists have screamed for govern- j
mental regulation of industry—and
they have got it. Professor have ha- <
rangucd for more theory in govern
ment —and we have it. Wets sue- !
ceeded in substituting "How Dry I j
Am" for the national anthem—and j
now they are happy. Such is the j
rew deal.
With nearly all major American j
traditions doing flip-flops around 1
+ he Washington monument, no one j
can help but become at least faintly j
interested. The period is one of in- !
terest in the government—which
is perhaps a good thing. Everyone ■
