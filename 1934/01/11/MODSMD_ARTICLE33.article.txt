# FRESHMAN QUINTET SHOWS FINE FORM, SWITCHES LINE-UP
## 
### 
Hitting the bucket from all sides
of the court, Bill Quade, lanky for
ward, found his eye last night and
ltd a slightly revamped fresh five
through a scrimmage which looked
as though the yearlings have finally
shaken off the slump which has
marked their play the past two
weeks.
With the experience of a trim
ming at the hand of San Fran
cisco's prep champs, Galileo High,
behind, the Frosh are planning
for a tussle with Lowell High of
the city, last night moved up
from Friday to Saturday night of
the coming week-end.
Chuck Glascow, coaching in the
absence of Rabbit Bradshaw, has
made a change in the frosh line-up
on defense which should result in
less set-ups being scored against the
Babes. Turner, 6-foot 2-inch for
ward, has shifted places with Ar
chie Zamloch, midget guard, giving
the Frosh three heavy six-footers
under the bucket.
The other change in the line-up
was at the center post now held by
Dale Beedle, Roy Williamson being
shifted to the second five.
Thirty-three nationalities may be
seen daily on Shanghai streets.
