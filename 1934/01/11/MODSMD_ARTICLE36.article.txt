# CAMPUS OPINION
## "HOW TO TELEPHONE AT STANFORD" IS REVEALED 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Concerning your defense of the
Tcyon Exchange, in yesterday's
''Dippy," many thanks. The much
maligned ( perators can now grace
fully crawl cut of their secret hid
ing place and reveal their identity
to the campus.
We appreciate your explanation,
Abe, but let me add a little more
information for the Unionites and
Encina Boarders to think about as
they jiggle the receiver hook (and
it doesn't do a bit of good) and
swear into the mouthpiece tonight.
The Toyon Exchange, with its ten
outside trunks and its two inter-hall
tvunks, was originally intended for
Toyon and Branner Halls. At the
present time there are over nine
hundred students using the ex
change, intended for less thai) five
hundred. Il might be interesting to
note that the Union receives at least
half of the calls on the exchange
ai.d it has only about eighty resi
dents.
It is not at all improbable that ten
people would decide to use the
phone service at one time. In fact
that is the general condition of the
exchange. When the trunks are full
the operators are powerless to give
further service, and when the in
tcr-hall trunks are also full the op
ciator can not even repeat the hated
"cage," the "trunks are all full."
The switchboard must also handle
all long distance calls, take mes
sages, call the Unionites for their
callers, appease irate long distance
operators, look up the rooms of the
students, and in genera! act as an
information bureau for the campus.
It requires valuable seconds to give

out this information, and yet cour
tcsy necessitates our bothering with
difficulty.
Here are a few suggestions thai
v, ill assist the operators in speeding
the phone service to a considerable
extent.
1. Don't give a detailed explana
tion of the number to the operator.
We take it for granted you're phon
ing someone and not giving out a
calculus formula.
2. Answer your buzzer immedia
tely, and then get to the phor.e booth
as soon as possible.
8. Always answer the phone with
your room number; the operators
are not mind readers.
4. Don't chat with the operator;
he isn't interested in your difficul
t'es.
5. Take the operator's word for it
when he srys the line is busy, he
knows.
6. Answer only your own buzzer.
Don't bother to ask if that buzzer
on the third floor, back of the Union
is for you, when you live on the
second floor front, because it isiv't.
7. Have parties calling you know
jour room number. (Union resi
dents exempted from this by Uni
versity ruling. They are always re
ferred to as "Miss," at least over th>
phone.)
Until the University sees fit to
expend the sum necessary for a
larger system, the present one must
l.c accepted. The operators are try
ing to give you decent service de
spite the handicap; so they deserve
to be treated just as decently.
Sincerely,
BILL MORSE,
Head Operator, Toyon Ex.

The Editor, Sir:
Concerning your defense of the
Tcyon Exchange, in yesterday's
''Dippy," many thanks. The much
maligned ( perators can now grace
fully crawl cut of their secret hid
ing place and reveal their identity
to the campus.
We appreciate your explanation,
Abe, but let me add a little more
information for the Unionites and
Encina Boarders to think about as
they jiggle the receiver hook (and
it doesn't do a bit of good) and
swear into the mouthpiece tonight.
The Toyon Exchange, with its ten
outside trunks and its two inter-hall
tvunks, was originally intended for
Toyon and Branner Halls. At the
present time there are over nine
hundred students using the ex
change, intended for less thai) five
hundred. Il might be interesting to
note that the Union receives at least
half of the calls on the exchange
ai.d it has only about eighty resi
dents.
It is not at all improbable that ten
people would decide to use the
phone service at one time. In fact
that is the general condition of the
exchange. When the trunks are full
the operators are powerless to give
further service, and when the in
tcr-hall trunks are also full the op
ciator can not even repeat the hated
"cage," the "trunks are all full."
The switchboard must also handle
all long distance calls, take mes
sages, call the Unionites for their
callers, appease irate long distance
operators, look up the rooms of the
students, and in genera! act as an
information bureau for the campus.
It requires valuable seconds to give

out this information, and yet cour
tcsy necessitates our bothering with
difficulty.
Here are a few suggestions thai
v, ill assist the operators in speeding
the phone service to a considerable
extent.
1. Don't give a detailed explana
tion of the number to the operator.
We take it for granted you're phon
ing someone and not giving out a
calculus formula.
2. Answer your buzzer immedia
tely, and then get to the phor.e booth
as soon as possible.
8. Always answer the phone with
your room number; the operators
are not mind readers.
4. Don't chat with the operator;
he isn't interested in your difficul
t'es.
5. Take the operator's word for it
when he srys the line is busy, he
knows.
6. Answer only your own buzzer.
Don't bother to ask if that buzzer
on the third floor, back of the Union
is for you, when you live on the
second floor front, because it isiv't.
7. Have parties calling you know
jour room number. (Union resi
dents exempted from this by Uni
versity ruling. They are always re
ferred to as "Miss," at least over th>
phone.)
Until the University sees fit to
expend the sum necessary for a
larger system, the present one must
l.c accepted. The operators are try
ing to give you decent service de
spite the handicap; so they deserve
to be treated just as decently.
Sincerely,
BILL MORSE,
