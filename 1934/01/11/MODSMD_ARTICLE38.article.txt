# RIPS RIPARIANISM AND NEWS DIGESTERS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In the News Digest yesterday ap
peared the story of Miller and Lux's
attempting to stop the construction
of the Central Valley Water Project
on the grounds that it would jeopar
dize riparian water rights.
I'd like to know why your News
Digesters think that the Miller and
Lux "gripe" is pretty legitimate.
For I have always thought that
any fair-minded person would read
i ily admit (1) that the doctrine of
I riparian ism would not have been
' applied in an arid state like Califor
nia in the first place, and (2) that
Ihc decisions upon water law handed
, down by our state courts in the past
j are an indictment against our hon
! csty as well as our intelligence. (Of
course M. and L. will base their
j "gripe" upon these decisions.)
What I am trying to say is that
I riparianism was foisted upon the un
! suspecting citizenry of California a

1 long time ago and that it performs
no useful purpose whatsoever today. ,
Riparianism is only a tool with !
which agricultural indigents who I
happen to own land along rivers can '
chisel the poor state.
So now maybe you can see my
difficulty in understanding why ;
your News Digesters woulcf label
liparian squawks "legitimate.''
