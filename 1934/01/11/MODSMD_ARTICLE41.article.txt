Mildly rebuking this column for
it.i attitude on the Stanford-Califor
nia-Idaho basketball series, John
Bunn, Stanford's aftable director of
basketball, buttonholed us the other
day and proceeded to lay down a
herrage of convincing reasons
against calling the games "boring."
In the first place, Bunn considers
Ihe cage play of the Rocky Mountain
area the purest example of the game
in the United States.
''Why, anyone who appreciates
basketball at all," he said, "could
get more enjoyment from watching
the finesse and polish of these
Idaho boys than from a whole sea
son «f the rough and tumble
quasi -football that exists in our
own Coast Conference. Particu
larly was the work of Watts and
Conley a pleasure; they depended
on skill and knowledge of the
game rather than mere strength
of physique."
Bunn considers his old conference,
the Big Six, next behind the moun
taineers for basketball polish, while
iho Western Conference, or Big Ten,
a«cl the Coast are about on a par,
trending to big, smashing teams
such as California lias this year.
He would like to foster the open,
clever style in this vicinity and to
tl»is end has worked diligently in
aiding to arrange the Utah Uni
versity, Utah Aggie series. Next
year he hopes to repeat the per
formance, until possibly a demand
lor that type of piay is created
among fans of the Pacific Coast.
At present Bunn's yearning for the
pure game must be repressed while
he conforms with the old saw of
wearing togas in Rome. Our confer
ence is essentially part of the old
push and grapple school, with some
I'ouLs called and a good many more
not called, and the man with the
strongest underpinnings has the best
chance of scoring points.
Indeed, aside from this bumpti
ous critic's displeasure, which was
directed at our dismal conference
standing outlook, reaction to the
Idaho boys was completely favor
able. Attendance was high; and
the same teams will likely draw
even better when they play a re
turn booking.
A further basketball side attrac
tion which Coach Bunn is eager to
sponsor, is a high school tournament
ot league winning teams to be played
here at the close of their regular
seasons. The plan is in a completely j

Mildly rebuking this column for
it.i attitude on the Stanford-Califor
nia-Idaho basketball series, John
Bunn, Stanford's aftable director of
basketball, buttonholed us the other
day and proceeded to lay down a
herrage of convincing reasons
against calling the games "boring."
In the first place, Bunn considers
Ihe cage play of the Rocky Mountain
area the purest example of the game
in the United States.
''Why, anyone who appreciates
basketball at all," he said, "could
get more enjoyment from watching
the finesse and polish of these
Idaho boys than from a whole sea
son «f the rough and tumble
quasi -football that exists in our
own Coast Conference. Particu
larly was the work of Watts and
Conley a pleasure; they depended
on skill and knowledge of the
game rather than mere strength
of physique."
Bunn considers his old conference,
the Big Six, next behind the moun
taineers for basketball polish, while
iho Western Conference, or Big Ten,
a«cl the Coast are about on a par,
trending to big, smashing teams
such as California lias this year.
He would like to foster the open,
clever style in this vicinity and to
tl»is end has worked diligently in
aiding to arrange the Utah Uni
versity, Utah Aggie series. Next
year he hopes to repeat the per
formance, until possibly a demand
lor that type of piay is created
among fans of the Pacific Coast.
At present Bunn's yearning for the
pure game must be repressed while
he conforms with the old saw of
wearing togas in Rome. Our confer
ence is essentially part of the old
push and grapple school, with some
I'ouLs called and a good many more
