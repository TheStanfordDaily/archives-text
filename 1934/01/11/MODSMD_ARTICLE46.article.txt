# CARDS LEAVE FOR SOUTH TONIGHT IN BASKETBALL TOUR
## 
### 
Leaving tonight for their first con
ference games set for tomonow and
Saturday nights with U.C.L.A. at
Los Angsles, Stanford's basket bai
lers expect to serve notice while in
Southern California as to just what
their intentions are in the way of
hoop conquests, if any, for 1934.
Pre-season dope places both Stan
ford and U.C.L.A. well below Calif
ornia and U.S.C. as far as potential
. iic-ngth i.s concerned. If Stanford's
quintet can prove itself definitely
superior to the Bruins, the eonfer
{-ice outlook may be changed con
siderably. Whether the U.C.L.A.
series proves anything or not, how
ever, it will at least ring up the cur
tain on the current conference sea
son, which always furnishes its
share of thrills no matter who car
ries off the laurels.
Injuries have already struck at
Coach John Bunn's players in the
shape of a dislocated shoulder for
Al Page which will keep him from
making die trip South. Keith Top
ping is stil I handicapped by a
broken finger which re received
before the basketball season
started, while Jack Cosgrove, al
though making the trip, may not
see action because of an injury.
Men making the trip to Los Ange
les are: forwards, Anderson, Gort
nor, Cowing, Shreve, and Jenkins
centers, Edelen, Topping and Grun
sky; guareis, Cosgrove, Rogers, anc
Mallatratt. Conference agreement
limits the number of men making a
t.ip to twelve, v/ith the home tean
also limited to the same number o(
players. Topping, though usually
playing center, has been working
out at forward and may see action
;it that post.
