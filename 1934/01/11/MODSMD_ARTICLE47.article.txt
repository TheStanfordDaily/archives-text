# CHUCK WINTERBURN RETURNS TO FARM AS GRAD STUDENT
## 
### 
; Charles Winterbum, former Stan
ford coach under "Pop" Warner, is
back again at Stanford this year,
tt.king courses on the campus.
Winterburn, who coached both
fiosh and varsity teams on the Stan
ford campus, as well as having ini-
Itial charge of the careers of the Car
! dinal sophomore team, who played
i their fro.sh year under him in 1932,
had many interesting comments to
! make.
As a graduate student in Physical
! Education, Winterburn is enrolled in
the school, taking courses necessary

for professional requirements. lie is
specializing in both hygiene and
physical education studies.
Interesting is the fact that because
of spring practice back East at Tetri
ple, where Winterburn i.s varsity
bi-ckfield ccach under Warner, he
will leave school within a few
mcnths. Because the school requires
t minimum residence period, it v/ill
be impossible for him to obtain his
final degree because of his jour
neys to and from the East, unless
he stays for a longer period of time.
When risked his reactions to the
Stanford team, Winterburn re
plied, "All season we were ex
ceedingly interested in the prog
ress of the Cardinal team, and
were very well pleased when 1 they
defeated the 'terrible Trojans.' I

was particularly interested in the
number* ol my former frosh who
U«»t regular berths on the varsitx
team in their first year of varsity
play."
As for Temple, Winterbuvn said
that the prospects are excellent, a
fine representative schedule has
hten arranged, with players coming
uj. from freshman ranks lu fill in
weak positions.
