With Gorman newspaper reports
thiottled tf> a mere announcement,
Marinus van dor Lubbe, moronic
Dutch mason, walked up Leipzig
scaffold steps dumbly, head still
drooping, was guillotined shortly
ill tor daybreak yesterday tor par
taking in Communist plot to burn
the Reichstag.
Van d?r Lubbe, who broke weeks
of silence during his trial by sud
denly demanding the death penalty,
went to the block despite a last
minute commutation plea by Queen
Wilhelmini of Holland but was
granted death by the knife rather
than hanging, which Nazis consider
less honorable.
