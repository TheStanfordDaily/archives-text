COUNSELOR-AT-LAW (Universal)
At the California Theatre
A fine play by Elmer Rice, an ex
cellent performance by John Barry
more, and splendid direction com
bine to make this film extremely
enjoyable. The original play has
been followed very closely, despite
the difficulty of compressing a stage
version, playing more than two
hours, into the feature picture
length of little more than one.
It is this difficulty which produces
one of the few defects in the pic
ture. Due to the rapid cutting of
scenes, the effect of some lines, very
impressive on the stage, is dimin
ished considerably. But they are not
many, and otherwise the shortening
is well done.
The entertainment value of the
picture rests largely on the shoul
ders of John Barrymore, as the title
indicates, nnd he does very well in
deed with the role of the self-made
lawyer who does what we laugh
ingly call "running the gamut of
the- emotions." By the time we left
the theatre we felt as if we'd been
doing a little running ourselves. It
is no kind of a show for people with
weak hearts. What that poor man
goes through, you wouldn't believe
it;
Bebe Daniels does a good job in
the main supporting role, and the
rest of the cast are very much up
to their work. Only Mrs. Simon, the
lawyer' wife, was pretty stereo
typed. The idea that anyone was a
complete nasty went out with the
moustache-twirling villains, or so
we had hoped. No man who had as
much insight and intelligence 3s this
lawyer would be taken in by that
particular kind of smug egotism.

However, vhe picture is well worth
seeing. There are plenty of tight
spots and more than a few laughs,
especially that giddy telephone op
erator who can say, "A as in Adam,
N as in Norman," and so on, faster
than you can say the alphabet.
The shorts are—must I tell you?
Why do they try to imitate Disney?

AS HUSBANDS GO (Fox)
At the Stanford Theatre
With Rachel Crothers' intelligent
play intelligently adapted and in
telligently acted, "As Husbands Go"
cannot but be good entertainment.
The story is that of Lucille Lin
gard, who falls in love with a young
writer, while traveling abroad. After
her return to faithful husband, the
writer appears, and promptly be
comes a fast friend of the husband,
j-ees the error of his transgression,
and departs—to the ultimate satis
tion of all.
The honors of the film are fairly
evenly divided, though Warner Bax
ter is featured as the husband. In
this instance, the role is made
slightly too sugary, demonstrating
again the fact that Miss Crothers'
male characters are not as well
drawn as her women. Baxter, how
ever, makes the most of the role he
was given.
Helen Vinson is charming as the
wife, though the part calls for lit
tle acting, beyond occasional exhi
bitions of perturbation. Catherine
Doucet in the role of the fluttery
Emmie Sykcs is delightful, creating
character by means of voice, gesture,
and a fine sense of humor.
There is a Laurel and Hardy
short—for them as likes 'em.
