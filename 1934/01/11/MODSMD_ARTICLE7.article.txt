# KREPS, NOTED SAVANT, GIVES MONEY VIEWS
## Professor of Economics Is In Favor of Inflation, If Applied Well MONEY INCONSISTENT Economist Says There Is No Fear of Non-Control 
### Irwin Jorgensen 
'"A sound dollar is necessary,"
[said Dr. Theodore J. Kreps, profes
i sor of economics* in an interview on
| inflation today, but that does not
j mean that Dr. Kreps is not in favor
I ol inflation.
It means Dr. Kreps is veiy much
in favor 01 inflation. Where many
I people have made mistakes in many
(long-winded inflation harangues, is
!in confusing a sound dollar with
j the present unsound dollar, and in
j trying to cover all the aspects of this
complicated problem in Ihe short
space of a newspaper interview such
this.
Unstable Dollar
j However, some of Dr. Kreps per
i tinent ideas on the subject can be
given. He says, "The dollar of the
hast four years has been an un-
I stable, unsound, unjust dollar, ft
has almost led us to universal bank
i ruptcy. For, though its value in
jteims of gold was constant, its value
| in terms of other things was any
thing but constant.
: "If all prices went up and down
together there would still be hard
ship, but only a little injustice, pro
| vided, however, that the whole price
structure was in balance before the
j price dfelme began."
He states that whereas the prices
of farm commodities, raw materials,
r.nd the earnings of 1 abor went
down, public utility rates, insurance
premiums, and other contract-fixed
| prices of the 1926 level hive re
mained the same. Taxes and pay
ments of interest and dividends have
even gone up.
Money Not Consistent
The evil has been that the dollar
has not been consistent in affecting
all prices. "The only sound and
honest dollar, let it be repeated em
phatically, is one which is stable in
value in terms of all commodities.
This is bound to mean a dollar
whose value in any' one item such
as gold will be allowed to vary in
the same way that its value varies
in potatoes or cotton. -
"By inflation I mean simply a rise
in prices," he says. "There are
many ways of causing it. One is to
si art the printing presses, making
more money, causing the value of
money to go down, and prices to
rise.
Velocity of Money
"Another way is to increase the
velocity of money, or the speed in
which money changes.
"One of the ways in which infla
tion is likely to come is that of cre
ating by presidential proclamation
a relative abundance of gold, the
simple process being that of de
valuating the gold dollar, making i(
worth, say, only 12 or 14 grains of
gold, the price of gold being estab
lished at, say $5 or $40 an ounce.
"But the real way in which in
flation has already begun and will
continue to operate is that of in
jecting government credit into
circulation." Along this line is the
jtublic works administration, which
has been authorized to spend over |
three billion dollars, and the bil
lions of dollars lent for farm and ;
urban mortgages; and by the lie
construction Finance Corporation.
"The end is not yet in sight, for
not only has the President repeat- j
cdly emphasized that he was com- 1
mitled to the policy of inflation, but I
he still has a considerable number j
of powers left whereby to achieve it.
Congress has authorized him to de- I
valuate the dollar by 50 per cent;|
to issue three billions in paper cur
rency; to require Federal Reserve
banks to buy three billions in gov- |
ernment bonds; and to initiate th: |
free and unlimited coinage of sil- ;
ver."
Controlled Inflation
About controlling inflation, Dr. ;
Kieps has little fear. "We had in
flation during the Civil War and
controlled it. England had inflation |
during the Napoleonic Wars and
during the World War and eon
trolled it." t i

'"A sound dollar is necessary,"
[said Dr. Theodore J. Kreps, profes
i sor of economics* in an interview on
| inflation today, but that does not
j mean that Dr. Kreps is not in favor
I ol inflation.
It means Dr. Kreps is veiy much
in favor 01 inflation. Where many
I people have made mistakes in many
(long-winded inflation harangues, is
!in confusing a sound dollar with
j the present unsound dollar, and in
j trying to cover all the aspects of this
complicated problem in Ihe short
space of a newspaper interview such
this.
Unstable Dollar
j However, some of Dr. Kreps per
i tinent ideas on the subject can be
given. He says, "The dollar of the
hast four years has been an un-
I stable, unsound, unjust dollar, ft
has almost led us to universal bank
i ruptcy. For, though its value in
jteims of gold was constant, its value
| in terms of other things was any
thing but constant.
: "If all prices went up and down
together there would still be hard
ship, but only a little injustice, pro
| vided, however, that the whole price
structure was in balance before the
j price dfelme began."
He states that whereas the prices
of farm commodities, raw materials,
r.nd the earnings of 1 abor went
down, public utility rates, insurance
premiums, and other contract-fixed
| prices of the 1926 level hive re
mained the same. Taxes and pay
ments of interest and dividends have
even gone up.
Money Not Consistent
The evil has been that the dollar
has not been consistent in affecting
all prices. "The only sound and
honest dollar, let it be repeated em
phatically, is one which is stable in
value in terms of all commodities.
This is bound to mean a dollar
whose value in any' one item such
as gold will be allowed to vary in
the same way that its value varies
in potatoes or cotton. -
"By inflation I mean simply a rise
in prices," he says. "There are
many ways of causing it. One is to
si art the printing presses, making
more money, causing the value of
money to go down, and prices to
rise.
Velocity of Money
"Another way is to increase the
velocity of money, or the speed in
which money changes.
"One of the ways in which infla
tion is likely to come is that of cre
ating by presidential proclamation
a relative abundance of gold, the
simple process being that of de
valuating the gold dollar, making i(
worth, say, only 12 or 14 grains of
gold, the price of gold being estab
lished at, say $5 or $40 an ounce.
"But the real way in which in
flation has already begun and will
continue to operate is that of in
jecting government credit into
circulation." Along this line is the
jtublic works administration, which
has been authorized to spend over |
three billion dollars, and the bil
lions of dollars lent for farm and ;
urban mortgages; and by the lie
construction Finance Corporation.
"The end is not yet in sight, for
not only has the President repeat- j
cdly emphasized that he was com- 1
mitled to the policy of inflation, but I
he still has a considerable number j
of powers left whereby to achieve it.
Congress has authorized him to de- I
valuate the dollar by 50 per cent;|
to issue three billions in paper cur
rency; to require Federal Reserve
banks to buy three billions in gov- |
ernment bonds; and to initiate th: |
free and unlimited coinage of sil- ;
ver."
