# Play Reading Draws Crowd
## Dr. Bailey Stands Out In Mrs. Hardcastle's Part 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
With a minimum of stooping, last
night's Sword and Sandals readers
rchieved one of their usual con
quests—this time with the reading i
of Oliver Goldsmith's comedy of
confusion, "She Stoops to Con-;
quer."
The star of evening—it now
happens so often as to seem repe
titious—was Dr. Margery Bailey,
who gave a delightful characteri
zation of Mrs. Hardcastle. Clever j
iit all her scenes, Dr. Bailey
achieved the high point of the
reading in the fifth act, in which
she was applauded for her con
summate handling of a single line. ,
The remainder of the players were j
uniformly excellent, some catching 1
the spirit o f the eighteenth century :
better than others. Paul Crary's j
Tony Lumpkin was a very clever |
piece of work, notably in his more j
thunderous moments.
James Benet had a difficult job i
as young Marlow, and he filled the .
assignment extremely well, particu- j
larly in his introduction to Miss j
Hardcastle, which was splendidly i
timed.
Virginia Marvin's Miss Neville j
was excellent, and she pointed every '
line, garnering many more laughs]
th;.n the part deserved. Miss Mar- j
vin should prove an asset to future 1
readings.
Dr. Merrill Clubb as Mr. Hard
castle was especially fine in the last j
two acts, where he got a maximum
of comedy out of his lines. Marian
Jones was charming in the some-.'
v,hat lesser role of Miss Hardcastle, |
while William Knapp, Robt. Brauns, j
Robert Dwan, and Professor Percy I
Martin were more than adequate in
the other parts.

California as well as Stanford stu
dents who have the yen to mark
lawns will be subject to expulsion
in the future.
