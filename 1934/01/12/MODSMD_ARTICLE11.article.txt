# Campus Experts Differ On Russo-Jap Question
## 
### 
Flagrant differences of opinion as ]
; to the danger of a Russo-Japanese
; war are noticeable between state-
I ir.ents of campus history professors
J and current press reports.
Newspaper propaganda playing up
war histeria in the Russo-Japanese
relations received a blow from Lec
turer Harold Fisher, Russian his
jtory authority, who denied any im
mediate danger of war between the
two countries.
\ "I do not think there is danger of
I wa: over China's railroad regardless
of the outcome of present negotia
tions," he said.
"Control will pass to Manchuria
with smaller compensation than
I Soviet Russia believes she deserves,
1 but I don't think she will fight,"
Mr. Fisher said.
As reason for his belief against
militaristic entanglements of the
I two countries, the history lecturer
explained that Soviet Russia is now
engaged in her second five-year plan
land that it is more important for

the country to maintain peace than j
to obtain the Chinese railroad.
"Russia will make any concession j
for peace except cession of terri- j
levy," Mr. Fisher believes.
The lecturer docs not believe that j
United States wili become involved ,
mi Russo-Japanese affairs because I
the mutual interests of the two na
tions are not of sufficient impor- j
tance.
"I think that we ought to be ready i
to act as mediator in case we are I
asked," Mr. Fisher said in speaking j
oi this nation's part in the problem. J
Professor Graham Stuart, who ad
mils that his opinion is based on I
newspaper reports, believes that I
there is a possibility of war.
"The recognition of Russia by the
United States has probably aided,
somewhat in lessening the danger," i
he said, and the large building pro
gram of our navy may also help to j
avoid it.
As to United States' possible en
tanglement in the JTar East situation
Mr. Stuart replied, "I feel that
United States has had enough of
war for some time to come, and that
we would be dragged into the war
only through some issue that would
arouse the people greatly."
Professor Stuart does not believe
that thex-e will be any kind of a
war for some time yet, but because
of continued press reports of the
danger, he is of the opinion that a
Russo-Japanese war is entirely
probable,
"All that I know is what I read
lin the paper. I don't see how any
| ene could tell," he added.
Professor R. H. Lutz holds the
I press responsible for the war propa
| ganda. "Ever since negotiations for
the purchase of Manchuria of the
I Chinese Eastern Railroad from the
• Soviet government, certain European
and even American newspaper cor
respondents have been developing
another Russo-Japanese war scare,"
he accused.
"Although the sources of this news
i are not simple to analyze, some of
them have already been proved by
j our informed scholars at Stanford to
be very questionable," Mr. Lutz
continued.
Professor Lutz estimates that the
armchair strategists are wrong. He
places little faith in the press re
ports and stands firm with his own
belief that there is no immediate
danger of war.

"Although the sources of this news

Professor Lutz estimates that the

Flagrant differences of opinion as ]
; to the danger of a Russo-Japanese
; war are noticeable between state-
I ir.ents of campus history professors
J and current press reports.
Newspaper propaganda playing up
war histeria in the Russo-Japanese
relations received a blow from Lec
turer Harold Fisher, Russian his
jtory authority, who denied any im
mediate danger of war between the
two countries.
\ "I do not think there is danger of
I wa: over China's railroad regardless
of the outcome of present negotia
tions," he said.
"Control will pass to Manchuria
with smaller compensation than
I Soviet Russia believes she deserves,
1 but I don't think she will fight,"
Mr. Fisher said.
As reason for his belief against
militaristic entanglements of the
I two countries, the history lecturer
explained that Soviet Russia is now
engaged in her second five-year plan
land that it is more important for

the country to maintain peace than j
to obtain the Chinese railroad.
"Russia will make any concession j
for peace except cession of terri- j
levy," Mr. Fisher believes.
The lecturer docs not believe that j
United States wili become involved ,
mi Russo-Japanese affairs because I
the mutual interests of the two na
tions are not of sufficient impor- j
tance.
"I think that we ought to be ready i
to act as mediator in case we are I
asked," Mr. Fisher said in speaking j
oi this nation's part in the problem. J
Professor Graham Stuart, who ad
mils that his opinion is based on I
newspaper reports, believes that I
there is a possibility of war.
"The recognition of Russia by the
United States has probably aided,
somewhat in lessening the danger," i
he said, and the large building pro
gram of our navy may also help to j
avoid it.
As to United States' possible en
tanglement in the JTar East situation
Mr. Stuart replied, "I feel that
United States has had enough of
war for some time to come, and that
we would be dragged into the war
only through some issue that would
arouse the people greatly."
Professor Stuart does not believe
that thex-e will be any kind of a
war for some time yet, but because
of continued press reports of the
danger, he is of the opinion that a
Russo-Japanese war is entirely
probable,
"All that I know is what I read
lin the paper. I don't see how any
