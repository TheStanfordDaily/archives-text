# Need Material For "Criteria"
## Lack of Poetry and Prose As Deadline Near 
### 
Pointing out that an unusual
opportunity for new writers to
publish their manuscripts is of
fered by the sccond number of
"Stanford Criteria," Albert Gucr
ard, Jr., editor of the supplement,
issued another appeal last night
for articles, stories, and poems.
An abundance of contributions to
the first issue necessitated numer
ous rejections at that time, but the
dearth of material sent in for the
February 1 number indicates that
competition will be less severe. The
c?rly publication date necessitates
a very early deadline; rushing and
ether activities regardless, contribu
tions for the second number of the
literary supplement should ariive at
the Daily office, or be'dropped in
the slot at Room 204 a, English
Building, before next Wednesday.
Unsuitable manuscripts will not be
returned unless accompanied by
stamped, self-addressed envelope.
It has been repeatedly empha
sized by the editors of '"Stanford
Criteria" that manuscripts coming
from any source will be consid
ered. Plans arc now maturing to
present two short articles in the
next issue by authors of national
prominence. But the bulk of
"Stanford Criteria" will be student
written, with a scattering of
alumni and faculty writers.
In its articles outside th? field ol
literary criticism, "Stanford Crite
ria" is interested in intellectual
rather than emotional, examinations
o f the wider aspects of the subjects
considered. The editors are not con
cerned with the more limited inves
tigation of controversial subjects.
"Stanford Criteria" is more inter
ested, for instance, in the theory ol
economic distatorship, than in Ihe
various phases of a specific move
ment, such as the N.R.A.
