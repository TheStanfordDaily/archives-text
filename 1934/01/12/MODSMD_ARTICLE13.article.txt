# Crash Victim Recuperating
## 
### 
Bob Jones, well known campus
sludent, and night editor on the
Stanford Daily, was pronounced
much improved last night by au
thorities of the Hayward Hospital.
Jones, rallied yesterday after al
most 48 hours of complete uncon
sciousness, and regained a state
where he was semi-conscious. How
ever, he was in no condition to
speak or to appear cognizant of hi.s
surroundings.
For this reason, it will impossible
to find out the reason for hi.s terrific
accident Tuesday night, one which
completely overturned his car and
wrecked it, pinning Jones in the
wreckage.
Today Jones' parents are arrang
ing to have him transferred to the
Peralta Hospital in Oakland.
