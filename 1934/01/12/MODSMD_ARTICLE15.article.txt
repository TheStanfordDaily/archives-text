# DR. THOMPSON AIRS VIEWS ON LEGAL LIQUOR
## Suggests Revision of Status Since Present Situation Must Not Endure 
### John McClelland 
Legal liquor—and the liner phases
voiced only in whispers in the realm
of Stanford—was expostulated on
today by Associate Professor Walter
Thompson of the Political Science ■
Department in an interview in j
which he expressed himself as I
' wholly discouraged with the entire
situation."
Stupidly the Rooseveltian admin- ;
istration has turned on the flow of
"spirits" full force without consid- j
eiing any of the problems that are
caused by dispensing, taxing, tar
iffs, and temperance, thinks Pro
fessor Thompson.
Bootleg Possibility
Now that the first bursts of glee
at completing a mainstay promise in
the Democratic platform are over,
state and federal officials are faced
with the possibility of the bootleg
era continuing in counter action of
the public's aversion to paying too
ikarly for their liquid cheer. This
situation together with that of edu
cating the American people to a
! sane drinking attitude, stated John
j yon, must of necessity be ironed out
in the near future.
"Although 1 was in favor of re-
I peal 1 can't deny that I consider the
j present situation far worse than in
j the prohibition days," the professor
j earnestly declared. "As long as the
; profit motive is present where any
i retail dealer can sell liquor any
where there will be considerable
I chaos wilh the whole situation."
Government Control
Professor Johnson believes that
j governments of Canada and Norway
have very successfully dealt with
| their liquor problems by govern
] ment dispensing and taxing to a
i moderate degree. The United States
I should adopt some similar plan. Bc
| fore the eighteenth amendment was
j passed this nation was one nf beer
i drinkers. People knew who made
j their liquor paid moderate prices
i for it.
But now the days of "getting
| drunk like a gentleman" are over,
jlne peddling of bulky beer gave
! way to the more easy dispensing of
| the more potent "spirits" and as yet
| the public has not become educated
I to social drinking in moderation.
"My idea of liquor control would
jbe this," said Johnson. "To grant a
charter to some public service com
j pany to control the importing and
I selling of all liquor. In this way not
I only the taxes would go back into
|the government coffers but the prof
! its also."
Tax Opinion
When asked about the bill re
' cently passed by the Senate fixing
la high tariff on all liquor imports to
' pay off the war debts the genial
i professor laughed heartily. "I would
rot be at all surprised if the bill
.went through but it would only be
(taking spite out on foreign countries
rather than trying to collect debts."
Johnson believes that all drinking
should be discouraged and that
| eventually when less emphasis is
hid on the consumption of alcoholic
I beverages America will be consid
ered as temperate a nation as
I France, Britain, or Germany. Pro
hibition will never be tried again.

Tax Opinion
When asked about the bill re

Legal liquor—and the liner phases
voiced only in whispers in the realm
of Stanford—was expostulated on
today by Associate Professor Walter
Thompson of the Political Science ■
Department in an interview in j
which he expressed himself as I
' wholly discouraged with the entire
situation."
Stupidly the Rooseveltian admin- ;
istration has turned on the flow of
"spirits" full force without consid- j
eiing any of the problems that are
caused by dispensing, taxing, tar
iffs, and temperance, thinks Pro
fessor Thompson.
Bootleg Possibility
Now that the first bursts of glee
at completing a mainstay promise in
the Democratic platform are over,
state and federal officials are faced
with the possibility of the bootleg
era continuing in counter action of
the public's aversion to paying too
ikarly for their liquid cheer. This
situation together with that of edu
cating the American people to a
! sane drinking attitude, stated John
j yon, must of necessity be ironed out
in the near future.
"Although 1 was in favor of re-
I peal 1 can't deny that I consider the
j present situation far worse than in
j the prohibition days," the professor
j earnestly declared. "As long as the
; profit motive is present where any
i retail dealer can sell liquor any
where there will be considerable
I chaos wilh the whole situation."
Government Control
Professor Johnson believes that
j governments of Canada and Norway
have very successfully dealt with
| their liquor problems by govern
] ment dispensing and taxing to a
i moderate degree. The United States
I should adopt some similar plan. Bc
| fore the eighteenth amendment was
j passed this nation was one nf beer
i drinkers. People knew who made
j their liquor paid moderate prices
i for it.
But now the days of "getting
| drunk like a gentleman" are over,
jlne peddling of bulky beer gave
! way to the more easy dispensing of
| the more potent "spirits" and as yet
| the public has not become educated
I to social drinking in moderation.
"My idea of liquor control would
jbe this," said Johnson. "To grant a
charter to some public service com
j pany to control the importing and
I selling of all liquor. In this way not
I only the taxes would go back into
|the government coffers but the prof
! its also."
