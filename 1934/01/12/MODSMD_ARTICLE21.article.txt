# WOMEN CLOSE RUSHING WITH BIDS TONIGHT
## Open Houses Tonight Will Begin Later Than In Past Years 
### 
Women's rushing season for
1933-34 ends officially with the j
bidding tonight of what will un
doubtedly be one of the largest
group of pledges ever taken by
Stanford sororities.
Bids will be issued at Roble from
7 until 9 o'clock by H. G. Hill, of
San Jose, official fraternity lawyer.
Freshmen will be interviewed al
phabetically and chauffeured up
Lasuen by Cap and Gown members.
Lawyer at Union
From Roble, Lawyer Hill will
journey to the Union where the
bidding of women living in those
houses comprising the Union unit
will take place.
Since there are eight houses in
cluded in this classification, all new
pledges will probably not reach
their respective houses before 11
o'clock. Consequently the pledge
night open houses through which
sororities introduce their new mem
bers to the campus cannot take place
until a much later hour than usual.
Period of Silence
Luncheon yesterday noon and
dinner last night concluded rushing
festivities, with today Ihe period of
silence before bidding takes place.
Those girls who go "undecided"
may not be contacted or pledged by
sorority members until late tomor
row night or early Sunday morning.
Dancing Tonight
Sorority houses will have the open
house and dancing customary with
women's pledge night on the Row
tonight, but due to the length of
time necessary to handle the large
number of sorority-bound women
this year, the hour that sorority
house doors will be thrown open
will necessarily be later than usual.
Although the time open house will
â€¢ start is optional with the individual
| houses, most houses do not expect
Ito be ready to welcome Stanford
| gentlemen callers until 10 or 10:30
i o'clock. Dancing will probably last
! until 11:30 o'clock.
Sorority open house on pledge
i night is one of Stanford's traditions.
'For years and years have men come
i or> this night to ogle at and dance
i with the women the different houses
I have pledged.
