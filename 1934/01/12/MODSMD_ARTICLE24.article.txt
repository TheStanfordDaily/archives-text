# Greek Council Postpones Pledge Night Dance Plans
## Council Names Committee To Decide About S.F. Party TO CONSULT WILBUR Action By Group Expected Early Next Week 
### Stan Beaubaire 
There will positively be no cam
pus celebration on the night of men's
pledging.
Unanimous action on the part of
the Interfraternity Council at a late
hour last night left the 24 Stanford
Greek letter houses failing to take
the suggestion of Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur that annual pledge night
parties be limited exclusively to the
campus.
Net results of last night's ses
sion were centered in the delega
tion of a five-man committee to
confer with Dr. Wilbur in his of
fice today to determine if any pos
sible conditions will permit him to
sanction the customary San Fran
cisco celebrations on January 1!>.
Further discussion lormulated un
animous decision to leave definite
action on the matter up to the in
dividual houses, if today's confab
does not bear fruit.
A.S.S.U. President Jerry Traut
man, loyal Constitutionalist, re
mained staunch in his official posi
tion calling for Administration sup
port.
"The A.S.S.U. Constitution will
be enforced. There is no alterna
tive," he declared. "Any reported
violation by a fraternity will be
submitted to the Men's Council
and University Administration for
proper action thereon. The entire
responsibility rests upon the fra
ternities."
Several houses have already
openly announced their intentions to
continue their usual plans for Bay
legion celebrations on pledge night.
This would indicate a definite test
of student governmental policy, ac
cording to observers.
Interfraternity Chief Donn Tatum,
pointing out his unified desire of
fraternity men to gather off the
S campus and the fact that plans for
well-established tradition have i n
1 most cases already been made, ox
i pressed his belief that "a complete
I leversal of plans at this late date
| will be very difficult."
"The fraternities, not realizing
that this night falls under the
A.S.S.U. jurisdiction 011 off-cam
pus parties," he continued, "look
i upon it much the same as Big
Game night. Naturally, however,
we intend lo submit to any proper
University or student ruling."
A special meeting of the Council,
jto consider these conclusions, has
l i.en called for the Chi Psi house al.
'/ o'clock Sunday night.
The A.S.S.U. Constitution reads:
"N<> organization may hold more
than one off-campus dance in two
I years. The approval of the appro
priate dean must accompany the re
j quest for a dale for any off-campus
I dance."

Pennsylvania highway patrolmen

"The fraternities, not realizing
that this night falls under the
A.S.S.U. jurisdiction 011 off-cam
pus parties," he continued, "look

Game night. Naturally, however,
we intend lo submit to any proper
University or student ruling."
A special meeting of the Council,

'/ o'clock Sunday night.
The A.S.S.U. Constitution reads:
"N<> organization may hold more
than one off-campus dance in two
I years. The approval of the appro
priate dean must accompany the re
j quest for a dale for any off-campus
I dance."

Pennsylvania highway patrolmen
recently confiscated the cars of 25
Lehigh University students, classing
them "as it lies unfit, to operate in
public."
There will positively be no cam
pus celebration on the night of men's
pledging.
Unanimous action on the part of
the Interfraternity Council at a late
hour last night left the 24 Stanford
Greek letter houses failing to take
the suggestion of Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur that annual pledge night
parties be limited exclusively to the
campus.
Net results of last night's ses
sion were centered in the delega
tion of a five-man committee to
confer with Dr. Wilbur in his of
fice today to determine if any pos
sible conditions will permit him to
sanction the customary San Fran
cisco celebrations on January 1!>.
Further discussion lormulated un
animous decision to leave definite
action on the matter up to the in
dividual houses, if today's confab
does not bear fruit.
A.S.S.U. President Jerry Traut
man, loyal Constitutionalist, re
mained staunch in his official posi
tion calling for Administration sup
port.
"The A.S.S.U. Constitution will
be enforced. There is no alterna
tive," he declared. "Any reported
violation by a fraternity will be
submitted to the Men's Council
and University Administration for
proper action thereon. The entire
responsibility rests upon the fra
ternities."
Several houses have already
openly announced their intentions to
continue their usual plans for Bay
legion celebrations on pledge night.
This would indicate a definite test
of student governmental policy, ac
cording to observers.
Interfraternity Chief Donn Tatum,
pointing out his unified desire of
fraternity men to gather off the
S campus and the fact that plans for
well-established tradition have i n
1 most cases already been made, ox
i pressed his belief that "a complete
I leversal of plans at this late date
| will be very difficult."
