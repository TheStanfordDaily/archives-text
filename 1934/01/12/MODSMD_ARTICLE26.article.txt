# THE 						LAMBS HAVE BEEN SHEARED
## 
### 
Toni«{lil Hie lambs >vill have been separated irom the
goals, and the lambs will have been branded, and sent their
merry way to their respective corrals on Lasuen.
The goats will wonder why they are goats. They will
wander along the silent halls of Roble, wondering why
they were left, why others were taken. The hectic days of
rushing are over. The mad wave of sorority activity has
passed on. The derelicts are left in Roble. They drill up
and down the lifeless corridors.
Xo one has yet been able to tell what is a goat and
what is a lamb according to the sorority standards —that
is, no one but the sororities. And judging from the cat and
cat lights that they stage at their rushing meetings they
are not quite sure themselves.
Hut just as long as some sort of selection goes on, just
as long as some are asked and some are not, weak-willed
females will feel the sting if they are not asked. That is
foolish; but that is the situation, pitiful as it is.
This year the situation is worse than usual; and usu
ally it is a thing horrible to contemplate.
I'sually; the women who are left turn Roble into a vale
of tears, a garden of broken hearts. The pleasantness of
I heir freshman dormitory is at an end. for their friend
ships are at an end. All of them have tried to impress the
sororities that they are qualified to join. All of them at
tempted to prove their superiority and many have failed.
This year the situation is worse because there are more
women. There are not more sororities. There will be more
goats more in the empty halls of Roble.
The Administration has moved to take care of the extra
women. They are building dormitories for them that far
exceed anything the Row can offer.
That should satisfy the women if they were logical.
Hut they are not. The frantic intensity that has pervaded
Roble for the last two weeks indicates that the frosh wo
men are not treating the matter logically.
As more women are admitted to Stanford, Ihe compe
tition to join a sorority will increase. Something should
be done.
The Administration cannot change the human nature
of the women frail as that human nature is. They can
alter the situation thai strikes a mean blow al so many
women.
Thev can abolish sororities.

passed on. The derelicts are left in Roble. They drill up
and down the lifeless corridors.
Xo one has yet been able to tell what is a goat and
what is a lamb according to the sorority standards —that
is, no one but the sororities. And judging from the cat and
cat lights that they stage at their rushing meetings they
are not quite sure themselves.
Hut just as long as some sort of selection goes on, just
as long as some are asked and some are not, weak-willed
females will feel the sting if they are not asked. That is
foolish; but that is the situation, pitiful as it is.
This year the situation is worse than usual; and usu
ally it is a thing horrible to contemplate.
I'sually; the women who are left turn Roble into a vale
of tears, a garden of broken hearts. The pleasantness of
I heir freshman dormitory is at an end. for their friend
ships are at an end. All of them have tried to impress the
sororities that they are qualified to join. All of them at
tempted to prove their superiority and many have failed.
This year the situation is worse because there are more
women. There are not more sororities. There will be more
goats more in the empty halls of Roble.
The Administration has moved to take care of the extra
women. They are building dormitories for them that far
exceed anything the Row can offer.
That should satisfy the women if they were logical.
Hut they are not. The frantic intensity that has pervaded
Roble for the last two weeks indicates that the frosh wo
men are not treating the matter logically.
As more women are admitted to Stanford, Ihe compe
tition to join a sorority will increase. Something should
be done.
The Administration cannot change the human nature
of the women frail as that human nature is. They can
alter the situation thai strikes a mean blow al so many
women.
Thev can abolish sororities.
