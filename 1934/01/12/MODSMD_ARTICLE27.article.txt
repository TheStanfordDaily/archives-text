# The 						Fraternities Stand Firm
## 
### 
That according to llic loiter of the law, tlio fraternity
pledge night parties in San Francisco arc illegal admits ot
no question. That the fraternities have been illegally hold
ing these parties also admits of no question.
It is the hope of the Administration to transfer this
celebration from San Francisco to the campus. Under the
present conditions on the campus, the fraternities have
refused to meet that request. The reason is obvious and
can be stated very simply. Pledge night is a night that
fraternity men desire to drink intoxicating liquors. They
cannot drink them at a campus affair with any measure ot
academic safety.
They realize that fact and therefore they desire to go
to the citv and drink in peace.
The Administration also realizes that factâ€”only too
well. They care not if any individual develops cirrhosis ot
the liver, fattening tissue around the heart or any other
<>!' the reported evils of liquor. Thev do care to preserve
tlie good name of the I niversily. Obviously, a Stanford
party anywhere that is characterized by the excessive con
sumption of alcohol reflects upon the I niversily.
What can be done?
A campus affair is out of the question. It would be
the logical answer if liquor were allowed on the campus.
Liquor should be allowed on the campus. Then its use
< ould be regulated; and the dangers of mass intoxication
avoided.
I'ndcr the present legally arid campus, the fraternity
men will go to San Francisco. If they are denied the right
to go openly, they will go secretly. That which has been
openly illegal will become secretly illegal. That is worse,
it possible. Surely it is no better.
The answer to the problem is to permit the fraternities
to hold their San Francisco party legally but only on the
condition that it is properly conducted. They should real
ize that if anything is done that would harm the Univer
sity's name, their rights will be taken away in the future.
And if Wilbur wishes to exercise his power, the fraterni
ties will fall like so many houses of straw in the story of
the three little pigs.
Doctor Wilbur should realize that the fraternities want
their liquor and the fraternities should realize that any
thing they do in San Francisco reflects upon the University.
