"SITTING PRETTY" (Paramount)
Al the Varsity Theatre
This adaptation of a popular New
York production is about as original
as "42nd Street," not so extrava
gantly overdone as "Footlight Pa
rade," and not quite as star-clustered
as "Dancing Lady." The Jacks, Oa
kie and Hale, cavort inanely through
their scenes, while Ginger Rogers
renders a spicy version of "Did You
Ever See a Dream Walking?" "The
Stairway of Dreams" number is en
ticing, to say the least. All in all,
if you can sit through "Sitting Pret
ty" you'll discover that it's an about
par addition to the current cycle of
musicales.
