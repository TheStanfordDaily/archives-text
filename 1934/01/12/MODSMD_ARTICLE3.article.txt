# Congress Bows
## 
### 
Congress bowed prettily for Mis
ter Roosevelt yesterday. The House
won't let anyone but members of
ihe appropriation committee make
amendments to the economy sec
tions of money bilLs. Hoepple, Dem.,
Calif., screamed that his own lead
era were trying to "Hitlerize" Con
gress, at which point Republicans
all cheered loudly.
The Senate dinged (after passing
day before) liquor bill amendment
putting an embargo on liquor from
debt-defaulting nations. Liquor
deals are Roosevelt's ace in the hole
in reciprocal trade agreements. F.R.'s
missionaries managed to leverse the
Senate stand.
