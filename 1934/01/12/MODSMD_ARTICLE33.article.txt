# CAMPUS OPINION
## PEACE AT ANY PRICE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
May I remind you, sir, that the
; ttitlide of the Administration with
regard to the Bawl-out is evidently
adamant, and that your intention to
overcome it by sheer journalistic
attrition can only result in ihe de
struction of the more friable peace
and enjoyment of the rest of us?
Furthermore grade publicity is at
least a merely superficial aspect of
a laiger problem and does not merit
ot itself such valiant effort.
The real problem is that of com
petition in education, particularly
its aspect of examinations and
grades. While the grade system em
phasizes competition too much and
represents • too often a misleading
estimate of student accomplishment,
because its means of measurement
(examinations) too often stresses
what is edueatively of little conse
quence, we must remember that the
system with all its faults, is by no
means of little worth. As an index
of a student's general standing in
the university relative to that of his
fellows it is a fairly reliable instru
ment. Within the limits of the sys
tem the Bawl-out. averages serve
a useful purpose. The discarding of
the grade system means a revolution
in educational philosophy on the
pari of both educators and students
as to the l'eal purpose of education.
This is coming; but f do not believe
I hat the present protest against the
Bawl-out springs from such a philo
sophic change on the part of the ob
jectors, but rather from a dislike, to
such grade publicity because it
makes apparent to all, intellectual
apathy or lethargy. This is an opin
ion too baldiy stated to be accepted
without an explanation, but I do
r.ot feel that I can explain except at
seme length. I may, however, sug
gest that the poem of the illustrious
Mr. Alfred Greep, in the issue of
December Bth, reflects an attitude
which rather well substantiates my
conclusions, although I arrived at it
on other grounds.
Let us "Drag Out the Bawl-out"
