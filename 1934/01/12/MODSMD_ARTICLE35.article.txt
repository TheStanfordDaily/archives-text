# NICE BAWL-OUT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I think that the Bawl-out is the i
most magnificent of all stupendous
ly, ess. I got three B's and the Bawl- ;
out has me down as plus 9. I think
the Bawl-out .should go on indefi
nitely. I think all people who go
more than plus 8 .should have a red j
star after their names.
Sincerely,
Owen Ulph
