# FRATERNITIES DOCILE?
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The process of squeezing down on
Stanford fraternities goes on. The
cdiet which forbids the fraternity
pledge night celebrations in the city
next Friday has, perhaps, a legal
basis. However, the Administration
definitely condoned pledge night for
i's long as we have been in school,
and, we understand, for a good
while before. The University has
known about it, said nothing—
which denotes approval.
The Alumni Association, with spe
cial University sanction, sponsors
a Big Gome celebration which ex
poses the Student Body to half the
population of drunken San Fran
cisco. Pledge night is a quiet tea
party compared to Big Game night
ii it is the orgy angle that bothers
the Administration.
A few weeks ago a rumor started
that halls and fraternities were
I going to be raided for liquor. The
whole campus jittered and poured
i good post-repeal liquor down drains
1 and into flower beds. Once again
vague threats are in the air. Now
J the question is, will the fraternities
j knuckle under again or will they
hang together and go to the city as
I was planned?
Federal Commissioner of Educa
tion Zook, a Democrat, says that
students are "too darned docile."
We agree.
