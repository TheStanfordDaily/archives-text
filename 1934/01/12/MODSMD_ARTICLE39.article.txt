## NEED A CHEER , I OK STANFORD RED 
### 
Stanford's cardinal-panted basket
eers v/ill be in Los Angeles tonight,
bravely trying to win a g;<me from
U.C.L.A. The two will share, ac
cording to all pre-seasonal calcula
t ons, the honor of furnishing door
nuts for unquenchable California
i-nd Southern California, their broth
ers in southern division of the Coast
Conference.
Well, give the boys a hand.
They're all nice chaps, though
slightly callow to be appearing in
this rough and tumble game of
university competition on the
hardcourts. Hut basketball has
many an odd screw along its
bumpy road, and this Indian
quintet may surprise by winning
more games than it loses.
The two teams that are mixing it
tonight have each appeared in five
] ire-Season contests. U.C.L.A. has
much the better of the argument,
Winning two games from Chico
Stole, an unknown quantity, taking
Si Mary's 55-45, Athens Club 33-27,
â€¢''.rid losing to the supr-r-strong
Olympic Club 35-30.
And that Olympian outfit must
be about the pick of the coast this
year, after beating Santa Clara
some 71 points to 35. The Broncos !
are no round-heeled aggregation,
an they proved by dumping Cali- j
fornia and U.S.C., on occasion, yet j
they had no chance against the j
towering club men.
Oh, well, who couldn't win games I
with Corbin, Davis, Vendt, Kintana |
of California; Dick Lintchicum and |
Frank Lubin, once of U.C.L.A. Sla- i
vich and Leahy of Santa Ciara, La- j
com be of Stanford.
Last year Stanford won three 1
close ones from the Bruins, after I
dropping the first match. Piper, their |
captain, is the man to stop.
