# Lindy on Stand?
## 
### 
U.S. No. 1 hero, Charles A. Lind
bergh, may be called before one of
those nasty Senate investigations.
Reason: the Col. received $250,000
vcrth of stock in Trans. Air Trans,
in 1928. The Senate thinks that
sounds furfny. TAT is now on the
carpet in connection with phony air
mail bidding.
