# BRUIN TRACKMEN DON'T FOOL AROUND
## 
### 
A most ambitious program is re- j
vealecl by the U.C.L.A. track
schedule for the current year, as
just announced. The Bruins, with |
their lip and coining crew built j
around Luvallc, the great quarter- |
rniler, are chewing off just about
the most intensive season of track j
competition that we have seen.
A track team used to be on view
formally but three or four times a
year, but these guys from the south
are entering no less than 12 meets.
Opening March 3, with a dual* en
counter with Pomona College, they j
skip through Riverside J.C., Fresno (
St;.to, University of California, San j
Jose State, Stanford, Southern Call
fornia, and Occidental College in J
dual meets.
Then they intend to take in the
West Coast Relays at Fresno, the i
California Intercollegiates, winding !
up with the I.C.A.A.A.A. at Phila
delphia and the N.C.A.A. at Los
Angeles.
Can you tic that one, Mr. Tem
pleton? â€”Hamilton
