Whether they will be the con
ference doormat over which sun
dry Bruins, Trojans, and Bears
will romp merrily to victory this
| year or weather they will give the
favored quintets a run for their
i money is a matter that Coach
J John Bonn's basketball men ex
i pect to shed some light on to
| night, when they meet U.C.L.A.
: at Los Angeles.
With few veterans returning, U.C.
! L.A.'s 1934 quintet is supposed to be
| of the comparatively small but ex-
I tremely speedy variety. First and
| foremost among the Bruins' threats
is Captain Don Piper, who has a
distressing habit of going hog wild
on a basketball floor and sinking
vast numbers of tallies. Against St.
Mary's, whom Stanford beat 34 to
32, Piper sank four consecutive field
goals in the last few minutes of
I play to nose out the Gaels single
' handed.
With Rod Bost taking the place of
Bob Grunsky, the Indian squad left
for Los Angeles last night minus
the services of A! Page, stellar
guard, who is out with a dislocated
shoulder. Tonight's starting line-up
wiil probably find Captain Hal Ede
len at center, Wetz Corter and Emil
Cowing or Keith Topping at for
wards, and Gordy Mallatratt and
Charlie Rogers at guards.
Gorter and Cowing are both jun
ior college transfers who have shown
considerable promise in pre-season
games. Topping will undoubtedly
see a good deal of action although
i.-111 j handicapped by a broken finger.
