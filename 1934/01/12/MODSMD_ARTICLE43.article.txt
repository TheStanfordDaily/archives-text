# Trackmen in Condition As First Meet Nears
## 
### 
With the probability that the first
weekly track competition will be
held two weeks from today, track
and field men are arriving at some
semblance of the "pink of condition,"
after the December layoff. Time
trials will be rare till the initial
meet, and field men will be merely
"getting their step." The coaches >
are trying to steer clcar of the
greatly bemoaned torn ligaments
tnd pulled tendons, and Bill Elling
ton puts his men through a stiff
session of calisthenics before getting
to work.
