## 
### 
With a newly aligned backfield
that ought to be dynamite once it
gets under way, and a scrum wall
packed with power, Stanford's rugby
15 play San Jose here tomorrow at
2:15 o'clock in the Stadium, admis
sion free.
The San Jose men are noted for
playing a rough game, and lost out
to the Olympic; Club, supposedly the
strongest in the league, by a nar
row margin last week.
Coach Jim Wylie of the Cardinals
hi;.s announced he will put the fol
lowing team on the field:
Fullback, Lee Ireland; left three
quarters, Joe Vigna; .center three
quarters, Bill Sim; right three-quar
ters, Johnny Reisner.
Second five-eights, Chuck White;
first five-eighths, Ray Lewis; half
back, George Fuller.
Wing forward, Rod Lewis.
Front rank, George Wyman, John
Hitchcock, Bob Gil!; second rank,
Jack Hillman, Milt Keller; rear
rank, Ben Palamountain, Roger
Hager.
The Stanford three-quarters line
will have ample speed, with Vigna,
frosh quarter, and elusive Johnny
Rei.sner on the wings, and Bill Sim
in the center.
