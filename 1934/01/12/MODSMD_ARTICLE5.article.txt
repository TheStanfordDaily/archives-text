# French Riots
## 
### 
While Premier Chautemps fought
to save his government from col
lapse, a rioting mob of royalists, op
ponents of the government of all
sorts, made a shambles of all the
districts within a mile of the Cham
ber of Deputies. Scores were beaten
and trampled, a newspaper editor
lost an eye, blank torpedos ex
ploded, small trees were uprooted, a
vegetable market was torn up and
mostly thrown, and hundreds ar
rested. God alone knows how many
were killed or arrested.
