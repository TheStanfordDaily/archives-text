# BASEBALL SQUAD BEGINS PRACTICE FOB 1934 SEASON
## 
### 
Sore arms and like early season
1 ills are steadily being eliminated as
the varsity baseball squad, working
out daily in the Sunken diamond,
rounds into shape for an intensive
i campaign which gels under way in
a few short weeks. The combina
i tion of sunny skies and liberal doses
of liniment to ailing flippers is
i speeding up the process.
Coach Harry Wolter Â«eems to be
! well satisfied with the material
I available and is now concerned
with molding an effective combina
tion to carry the Indians through a
successful season. Plenty of talent is
available for the outfield posts,
where the toughtest battle for start
ing posts is being waged. At least
six men, including Captain Dick
Miies, are outstanding in the race.
Maggiora, center fielder and lead-off
| man on the varsity last year, and
Hamilton and Moscvip, who have
j graduated from the frosh, will make
'itrong bids for the two remaining
! jebs, while Nutting and Neuman,
i who also saw some service, will be
: nipping at their heels.
The knottiest problem Wolters
I faces continues to center around the
i shortstop post. The three candidates
I for the job, Clark, Galbraith, and
j Edwards, are practically on a par
las far as fielding is concerned., and
!final selection will probably hinge
on their respective hitting abilities.
Eobby Grayson last night made
his belated appearance on the cam
put after visiting in Portland and it
is expected that he will report for
practice Monday. Unless he is
I shifted to another position he will
j compete with Hearn for the first
1 base job.
Teresina's recent success at Stan
ford has insured the idea of pre- , |
senting a dance recital yearly un
der the Concert Series banner.
