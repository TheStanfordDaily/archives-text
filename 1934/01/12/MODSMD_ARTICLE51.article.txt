A> guest preacher Reverend Roy j
L. Smith, of the First Methodist j
Church, Los Angeles, will deliver i
the sermon at the Memorial Church
, on Sunday, January 14, at 11 o'clock, j
Dr. Smith, as well as being a min- j
ister, is an author of some role. He j
has several books to his credit on j
| the subject of church methods, as 1
well as books of essays and epi
grams. Some of the better known I
ore "Spare Tires" and "Some Wild |
Notions I have Known."
He is well fitted for his position,
having obtained degrees from five 1
colleges and universities. He has
i also worked as a social worker,
1 newspaper Correspondent, editorial i
! writer, and business executive. He j
has broadened his life experiences \
Iby membership on crime commis- j
! sions, industrial committees, and j
, grand juries.
Edwin Markham, when writing j
of I)r. Smith as a speaker, says: j
"Roy Smith is dynamic and debo- |
nair; his addresses are not old- !
style sermons, pompous and prosy. |
They leap, they live, they soar, j
they sing. They do not deal with j
a dead past. He does not offer us i
a chain of extinct volcanoes. In- <
stead, lie offers us a gospel that 1
will help men in their daily strug- i
gics. He comes to rebuild broken !
walls, to relight extinguished j
lamps. He moves the brittle edge I
of the moment."
; Mr. Allen and the choir will fur- j
r.ish the music. Mr. Allen will also |
repeat the organ program he played \
, last Thursday at four o'clock.
