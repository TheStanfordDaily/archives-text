# WILBUR, GROUP DISCUSS PLANS FOR TRANSFERS
## Leaders Hope to Orient Junior Students On Arrival 
### 
No more transfers, junior and
otherwise, floating around unat
tached to any group and generally
unoriented to University life is the
torch leading of the group which
assembled last night at President
Wilbur's home to found a complete
aid department.
For those men who feel that their
interest lies in a social organization
a smoker for the transfers at which
at least one representative from
each fraternity and eating club will
circulate was suggested.
Hitch Chairman
Tom Hitch, member of Interfra
ternity Council, was appointed by
Dr. Wilbur as the chairman of a
committee which will prepare to 1
welcome future crops of transfers, j
He will be assisted by Bill Morse j
[.nd a committee yet to be chosen in 1
preparing lists of prospective trans
its and informing them, sometime I
before they appear on the campus,
ai reception facilities and of a skele- I
ton outline of facts which will aid j
in making the transfer feel at home. |
The letter the transfer receives!
before he registers will inform him j
of a desk to be maintained in the j
Administration Building on Regis- j
(ration Day equipped to deal with j
the particular problems confronting !
the man who comes from a junior j
college or another university. The j
men who will serve in this capacity j
will be chosen for their ability to
tek'e a broad viewpoint on the prob- ;
lems of the transfer.
Live on Campus
The desirability of the transfers j
living on the campus was stressed.,
preferably in a group of undergrad- \
uates. However, certain advantages
of living in Encina were brought
out, especially for the transfer seek- i
ing a background from which to j
launch himself into student politics, j
Disadvantages and advantages to 1
the transfer's position were the cen
ter of a short discussion. Hitch,
a transfer last year, said that he
found abrupt break in his academic
career distinctly useful.
"Political Savvy"
A.S.S.U. Vice-President John Ly
man felt that the innate qualities'
of the transfer himself, termed by
Dr. Wilbur "political savvy," would
determine his success in making a
place for himself in student life in
the two years before his graduation.
He said, though, that a movement
such as this would do much in
bringing out latent talents which
would help the transfer make a se
turc place for himself in Stanford
life.
The student, committee which has
been planned will in turn be in close
alliance with the Dean of Men
George Culver, Registrar John P.
Mitchell, Vocational Guider C. G.
Wrenn, and heads of the depart
ments in order to set the transfer
on the truest path scholastically and
avoid mix-ups which can do a lot
toward tying the transfer down and
making a thorough Stanford student
instead of a mere looker-on.

Live on Campus
The desirability of the transfers j
living on the campus was stressed.,
preferably in a group of undergrad- \
uates. However, certain advantages
of living in Encina were brought
out, especially for the transfer seek- i
ing a background from which to j
launch himself into student politics, j
Disadvantages and advantages to 1
the transfer's position were the cen
ter of a short discussion. Hitch,
a transfer last year, said that he
found abrupt break in his academic
career distinctly useful.
"Political Savvy"
A.S.S.U. Vice-President John Ly
man felt that the innate qualities'
of the transfer himself, termed by
Dr. Wilbur "political savvy," would
determine his success in making a
place for himself in student life in
the two years before his graduation.
He said, though, that a movement
such as this would do much in
bringing out latent talents which
would help the transfer make a se
turc place for himself in Stanford
life.
The student, committee which has
been planned will in turn be in close
alliance with the Dean of Men
George Culver, Registrar John P.
Mitchell, Vocational Guider C. G.
Wrenn, and heads of the depart
ments in order to set the transfer
on the truest path scholastically and
avoid mix-ups which can do a lot
toward tying the transfer down and
making a thorough Stanford student
instead of a mere looker-on.
No more transfers, junior and
otherwise, floating around unat
tached to any group and generally
unoriented to University life is the
torch leading of the group which
assembled last night at President
Wilbur's home to found a complete
aid department.
For those men who feel that their
interest lies in a social organization
a smoker for the transfers at which
at least one representative from
each fraternity and eating club will
circulate was suggested.
Hitch Chairman
Tom Hitch, member of Interfra
ternity Council, was appointed by
Dr. Wilbur as the chairman of a
committee which will prepare to 1
welcome future crops of transfers, j
He will be assisted by Bill Morse j
[.nd a committee yet to be chosen in 1
preparing lists of prospective trans
its and informing them, sometime I
before they appear on the campus,
ai reception facilities and of a skele- I
ton outline of facts which will aid j
in making the transfer feel at home. |
