# NEWS DIGEST from The United Press
## The 						$ Is Now 50 Cents 
### 
Apparently yielding to pressure
from all sides, F.R. has finally taken
a definite stand on what interests
everybody most —money. This morn
ing hi: will go before Congress, ask
for revaluation of the dollar in terms
of gold—which means the $ will
henceforth be 50 cents —not 100. He
will also ask for title to all mone
tary gold in U.S., most of which is
held by Federal Reserve Banks.
Court battles are expected over this.
Decision to take these drastic
steps came after a heated two-hour
conference attended by F.R., Mor
ganthau, Congressional fiscal ex
perts. Probable result will be sharp
upping of the price of gold to some
where around $40 an ounce, rising
prices, booming stocks, therefore in
flation—or what is left of it.
Thus sitting in a poker game, F.R.
staked everything on his last card.
If he wins, result will be prosperity.
If not —well, never mind.
