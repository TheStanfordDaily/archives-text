# Union Maids Unruffled By Sorority Snubbings
## 
### 
Alas! it's all over, but how disap
pointing! No excitement, no crying,
no all-night bull sessioning. Only
junior dignity and calm decisions
apparent.
Oh, yes, there was a bit of flttting
about during rushing week, and lots
of flutter about dressing, for "pref
erence" night, and the usual line of
advice:
"Now, Mamie, do you think they'd
like this dress better than the blue
one, or do you think the black one
looks more expensive," and "really,
Ruthie, I think you do appear much
more sophisticated with your hair
done up and that little rhinestone
ornament of Gertrude's in it."
Then with the parading all over
and the judges about to award the
"blue ribbons," more gush from the

i rushees:
" What house are you going 1o join?
I've got bids to two already, have
you? Wish I knew who el.se is
! gonna go."
"Gee, we'll get a lot of dates when
wo get on ihe Row.''
Rut the tune changed some Sat
urday morning, and the former bab
ble revolved itself into.
"Well, I know that house doesn't
i rate so hot on campus but it's better
than nothing."
"I think the girls in the one I
joined arc kind of dumb, but I just
couldn't face the folks back home
if I didn't go a sorority."
Meanwhile, Ihe majority of Union
residents earned on their usual pro
grams, glad that they had reacted
immune when exposed to the disease
of sororititus."
