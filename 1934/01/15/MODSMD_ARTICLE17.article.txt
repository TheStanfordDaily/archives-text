# Bailey Willis Makes Next Air Lecture
## Quake Expert Talks Over KPO Tomorrow 
### 
j Americans can be safe during
earthquakes and it is up Lo Cali
fornians to show them how, in the
opinion of Dr. Bailey Willis, pro
fessor emeritus of geology, who
gives the second of the Stanford
series of educational talks at 7:45
o'clock tomorrow night over KPO.
Five-year president of the Seis
mological Society of America and a
recognized authority on earthquake
: conditions, Dr. Willis maintains that
| every community, and especially the
! officers charged with public admin
! istration, have a moral responsi
; bility to safeguard the public. Rigid
inspection of buildings would pass
j such responsibility to individual
! owners, these owners becoming both
morally and financially responsible
for any death or injury.
Theme for Talk
Dr. Willis will take for his theme
I "The business aspect and cost of
earthquake security in contrast to
| the certain disaster and cost of a
I laissez-faire policy."
Careless construction without
l ihought of the future has resulted
in conditions in many of the larger
cities which would produce an ap
| palling loss of life in the event of
! a shake, a thing bound to occur
j sometime during the future life of
buildings constructed in the last 20
! years, Willis holds.
Reconstruction and strengthening
j of these buildings could be done at
1 a cost of from one to 20 per cent of
I the original cost, according to Dr.
! Willis; and Californians cannot af
■ ford to wait for disaster before put
j ting into effect their present knowl-
I edge of earthquakes and earthquake
I resistance.
Papers Published
Dr. Willis is the author of many
papers on this subject, including
i "Earthquake Risks ,in California,"
| published in the Bulletin of the
' Seismological Society of America;
j "La Casa Barata," a South Ameri
j can builders' handbook; and "Liv
; ing Africa," an account of his ex
i plorations in the dark continent.
Next week's offering on the se
i ries of educational talks will find
J Professor Theodore Kreps, associate
; professor of statistics in the Gradu-
I ate School of Business, before the
1 microphone. His topic will be "In
! dusty and the Problem of Unem
| ployment."

gives the second of the Stanford
series of educational talks at 7:45
o'clock tomorrow night over KPO.
Five-year president of the Seis
mological Society of America and a
recognized authority on earthquake
: conditions, Dr. Willis maintains that
| every community, and especially the
! officers charged with public admin
! istration, have a moral responsi
; bility to safeguard the public. Rigid
inspection of buildings would pass
j such responsibility to individual
! owners, these owners becoming both
morally and financially responsible
for any death or injury.
Theme for Talk
Dr. Willis will take for his theme
I "The business aspect and cost of
earthquake security in contrast to
| the certain disaster and cost of a
I laissez-faire policy."
Careless construction without
l ihought of the future has resulted
in conditions in many of the larger
cities which would produce an ap
| palling loss of life in the event of
! a shake, a thing bound to occur
j sometime during the future life of
buildings constructed in the last 20
! years, Willis holds.
Reconstruction and strengthening
j of these buildings could be done at
1 a cost of from one to 20 per cent of
I the original cost, according to Dr.
! Willis; and Californians cannot af
■ ford to wait for disaster before put
j ting into effect their present knowl-
I edge of earthquakes and earthquake
I resistance.
Papers Published
Dr. Willis is the author of many
papers on this subject, including
i "Earthquake Risks ,in California,"
| published in the Bulletin of the
' Seismological Society of America;
j "La Casa Barata," a South Ameri
j can builders' handbook; and "Liv
; ing Africa," an account of his ex
i plorations in the dark continent.
Next week's offering on the se
i ries of educational talks will find
J Professor Theodore Kreps, associate
; professor of statistics in the Gradu-
I ate School of Business, before the
1 microphone. His topic will be "In
! dusty and the Problem of Unem
| ployment."
