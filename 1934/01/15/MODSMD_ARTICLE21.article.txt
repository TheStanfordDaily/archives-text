# RECORDS FALL AS 138 PLEDGE TO SORORITIES
## Alpha Phi's Head List With Total of 24; D.G.'s Get Runnerup Honors 
### 
In a storm of wild kissing and
cheering, ihe largest parcel of
women in the history of the Farm
were pledged up the Row Friday
night.
Alpha Phis, fourth place runner
up in last year's embroglio, emerged
on the top of the 1934 list, boasting
24 captures out of a swarm totaling
138.
Other houses boasted less loudly
of "quality over quantity." Common
cry on the Row: "We got our class!"
The Daily found that at least one
house had not pledged all bid
women indexed on rushing lists.
D.G.'s Take Second
D.G.'s took second place in the
numerical count with IS new sis
ters; Kappas were third with 18;
Chi O's, Thetas, and Pi Phis were
in a 17-17-17 tie for fourlh; Gamma
Phis had 10 little achievements; Al
pha O's and Tri Delts were tied in
the cellar position with eight apiece.
Charging up Lasuen for their an
nual Rush Night Soiree, Stanford
roughs found easy pickings in all
houses. Last year there had been
only 76 additions to the Row colony.
Men who arrived early saw eager
sisters peeking through parlor cur
tains in expectation of pledge ar
rivals, saw the flood of promiscuous
osculating and embracing which
greeted any and all pledges.
Food and refreshments were no
ticeably lacking at most houses.
Water was present in abundance.
Consolation Party
Houses locked up around 11:30
o'clock, prepared for the real fire
works. Previously, mattresses had
been imported from Palo Alto;
couches, bay windows, floors had
been commandeered for old sisters
who graciously gave up downy beds
to the first nighters. Phone and tele
gif.ph had informed patents of the
results. Meanwhile, 40 Roble maid
ens took the long trail to San Fran
cisco for the Roble Roundup, an
nual Consolation Party. There the
group split to attend "Rorrfcin Scan
dals" and "Eight Girls in a Boat."
Saturday morning, 17 girls re
ported for breakfast in the spacious
Rcble dining hall. By Sunday, con
ditions were almost normal.

not receive copies of the Daily's
rush extra, distributed early Satur

lists up to dale, complete results of
