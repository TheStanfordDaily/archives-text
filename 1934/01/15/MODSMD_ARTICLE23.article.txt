# "Criteria" Near Deadline; Face Copy Shortage
## Editors Ask Local Authors To Submit Material 
### 
Buried yards deep under sonnet
sequences, ballads, rondels, and
samples of free verse, but gasping
for a few breathing spells of articles
and stories, the editors of "Stanford
Criteria' issued another wail last
night for manuscripts from campus
authors.
"The deadline is Wednesday,"
gasped a struggling copy-reader
last night, as he chewed nervous
ly on a translation from Swedish
free verse. A hired slave, buried
under a mass of heroic odes, mur
mured his perplexity at not hav
ing any prose to digest. "And I
expected so many fine articles on
economics, philosophy, and his
tory, and all I get to read is
poetry!"
The editors expressed their hope
last night that the end of women's
rushing would mean the beginning
of women's efforts on behalf of the
"Daily's struggling magazine sup
plement, which is to make its ap
pearance early next month.
"There will be a division of prof
its—verbal profits, of course—to all
who fill in the breach with manu
scripts covered with neatly type
written prose."
A vast din surrounding the region
of the Daily office last night indi
cated that there would be some
changes made in this second num
ber of "Criteria." No articles on
music and art, for instance, ap
peared in the first issue, but these
are expected for the second num
ber.
The editors once again reiterated
that the deadline was Wednesday,
that manuscripts should be accom
panied by self-addressed, stamped
envelopes, and that they should be
left at the Daily office, or dropped
in the slot of Room 204 a, English
Building.
