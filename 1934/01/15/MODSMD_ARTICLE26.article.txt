# Streamlining Reaches New High In 1934 Automobiles
## 
### 
Auto streamlining reaches a new I
hitfh as the big executives of the
industry bring out their latest brain
children. University Professors E.
P. Lesley, mechanical engineering,
and E. G. Reid, aerodynamics, mu
tually agree that the innovations
are but a small step to what is pos
sible.
The 1934 models are put out
merely as "feelers" to determine the
extent of public approvalâ€”further
moves in exploiting the principles
of aerodynamics in automobiles in
creasing in a gradual evolution as
their advantages arc appreciated by
motorist and engineer. Further, Pro
fessor Reid believes that with the
present knowledge of these prin

ciples, it would be possible to build
a 05 - horsepower car capable of
cruising at 100 m.p.h.
The universality of cars employ
ing streamlining heralds a new peak
of success in the conflict to force
down atmospheric resistance to a
minimum, resulting in greater speed,
economy, comfort, and appearance.
Dr. H. C. Dickinson, president of
the American Automotive Engineer
ing Society, Walter P. Chrysler, and
newspaper auto editors everywhere
acclaim the tapering lines and grace
ful curves and look for more and
more of it in the future.
