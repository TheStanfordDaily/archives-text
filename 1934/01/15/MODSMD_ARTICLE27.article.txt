# Inter-Fraternity Council Names Pledge Prom For Friday Night On Campus
## Dance Will Last From Ten Until Tree-Thirty If Lockouts Okehed DECISION UNANIMOUS Women's Group Members Favor Action Taken 
### George Wilson 
A "Pledge Prom" will be held this
Friday on the campus, starting at 10
o'clock and lasting through break
fast, if 3:30 o'clock lockouts for
campus worn n can be arranged for.
This action, taken last night at
a meeting of the Interfraternity
Council, reversed the decision
reached at last Friday's meeting
of the same group, and ends all
talk of a city celebration follow
ing the pledging of the men of '37.
At the meeting last Friday, a com
mittee consisting of John Bacon,
Jack Freeman, Bill Stark, Duncan
Mcßryde, and Chairman Dave Pack
ard was appointed to confer with
Dr Wilbur on plans for the pledge
night celebration, which were any
thing but definite at that time.
Unanimous Okeh
The report of the committee was
read at last night's meeting, and the
motion 1o hold an on-campus cele
bration followed immediately. The
action' was approved unanimously
by the council.
Outstanding among the details
that have come up in arranging for
as large an affair as this Friday's
include financing, arranging for late
leaves, and officially granting the
date. The combined facilities of the
Women's Gym and Dance Studio
have been obtained for the dance,
assuring room enough for everyone.
It was decided to assess each house
according to its size iu order to pay
for the dance, which will be infor
mal. An estimate was submitted by
which each house was to pay less
than half of what it probably would
have cost to go to the city.
Late Leave Problem
The solution of the problem of
iMe leaves, lies largely in the hands
of the Women's Coyncil. Members
of that body late last night voiced
their approval, indicating favorable
action probably will be taken.
A.S.S.U. Piesident, Jerry Traut
man staled that the Ex Committee
was practically certain 1o grant the
dale.
Jeanne Millard, A.W.S. president,
was decidedly in favor of the cam
pus dance. When questioned last
night, she voiced her < pinion: "I'm
sure the Council acted wisely when
they decided on a campus dance. I
no reason why 3.30 late leaves
cannot be arranged."
Sets Precedent
Dave Packard, speaking for the
Council, explained last night's ac
tion, which sets a precedent in
pledge nigh' activities.
"In this action," said Packard, "we
are trying to remedy the difficulties
of former pledge-night parties, and
al the same time to give the fra
ternity men as good oi better a time
than they would have had in the
city.
"In view of the fact that this is a
difficult problem for fraternities to
meet," lie continued, "and in view
of the shortness of the time before
the dance, it is imperative that all
the houses give their loyal support."

of the shortness of the time before
the dance, it is imperative that all
the houses give their loyal support."
A "Pledge Prom" will be held this
Friday on the campus, starting at 10
o'clock and lasting through break
fast, if 3:30 o'clock lockouts for
campus worn n can be arranged for.
This action, taken last night at
a meeting of the Interfraternity
Council, reversed the decision
reached at last Friday's meeting
of the same group, and ends all
talk of a city celebration follow
ing the pledging of the men of '37.
At the meeting last Friday, a com
mittee consisting of John Bacon,
Jack Freeman, Bill Stark, Duncan
Mcßryde, and Chairman Dave Pack
ard was appointed to confer with
Dr Wilbur on plans for the pledge
night celebration, which were any
thing but definite at that time.
Unanimous Okeh
The report of the committee was
read at last night's meeting, and the
motion 1o hold an on-campus cele
bration followed immediately. The
action' was approved unanimously
by the council.
Outstanding among the details
that have come up in arranging for
as large an affair as this Friday's
include financing, arranging for late
leaves, and officially granting the
date. The combined facilities of the
Women's Gym and Dance Studio
have been obtained for the dance,
assuring room enough for everyone.
It was decided to assess each house
according to its size iu order to pay
for the dance, which will be infor
mal. An estimate was submitted by
which each house was to pay less
than half of what it probably would
have cost to go to the city.
Late Leave Problem
The solution of the problem of
iMe leaves, lies largely in the hands
of the Women's Coyncil. Members
of that body late last night voiced
their approval, indicating favorable
action probably will be taken.
A.S.S.U. Piesident, Jerry Traut
man staled that the Ex Committee
was practically certain 1o grant the
dale.
Jeanne Millard, A.W.S. president,
was decidedly in favor of the cam
pus dance. When questioned last
night, she voiced her < pinion: "I'm
sure the Council acted wisely when
they decided on a campus dance. I
no reason why 3.30 late leaves
cannot be arranged."
Sets Precedent
Dave Packard, speaking for the
Council, explained last night's ac
tion, which sets a precedent in
pledge nigh' activities.
"In this action," said Packard, "we
are trying to remedy the difficulties
of former pledge-night parties, and
al the same time to give the fra
ternity men as good oi better a time
than they would have had in the
city.
"In view of the fact that this is a
difficult problem for fraternities to
meet," lie continued, "and in view
of the shortness of the time before
the dance, it is imperative that all
the houses give their loyal support."
