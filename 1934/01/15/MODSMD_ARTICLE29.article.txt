# FRATERNITIES MEET THEIR PROBLEM
## 
### 
Friday, there was an impasse and the impasse has van
ished. A diplomatic coup of the first water lias been real
ized. Doctor Wilbur will probably be satisfied and the
Interfralernity Council is satisfied. Everything is Jovey
dovev.
The Interfralernity Council, at first a bit stunned by
the desire of the Administration to cancel their party, have
seen the light. Now, they have reached out and made the
light their own.
Thev are providing their members with a campus func
tion. They are providing their members with a dance that
cuts the city pledge night bill in half and as a result will
no doubt keep practically all their members on the campus
Friday.
If the fraternities put their plan over, and all indica
tions point toward success, they will rise in University
estimation immensely. Putting over their affair entails two
things: First, the great bulk of fraternity men must attend;
second, "city" conduct must be squelched most emphati
cally.
r>v solving this problem, the fraternities have helped
tin 1 President over a tough spot. Conduct in the San Fran
cisco hotels was always a bitter problem. The Creeks have
solved this. Dr. Wilbur, always erroneously classified as
an "enemy" of fraternities, will now more than ever aid
them. . •
The problem has become so simple because the Daily
saw more to the situation than existed. We thought that
tiie fraternities wished to move city-ward in the desire to
imbibe. Obviously that couldn't be done on the campus.
Obviously, a problem. Now, we are officially informed that
the fraternities do not go to the city to drink, that the
majority desire this affair to display the season's fresh
man catch.
The problem vanishes into thin air. The display can
take place in the Dance Studio and Gym as easily as it can
;il the city hotels, and at less expense.
The Daily deeply apologizes to the fraternities for
branding them as inveterate drinkers, wishes them success
in their Pledge Prom.
