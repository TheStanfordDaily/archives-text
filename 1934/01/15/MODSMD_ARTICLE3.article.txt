# Hard Coal Dog Fight
## 
### 
Strike-weary Pennsylvania was at
il again yesterday. This time there
is plenty of trouble in the famed
Wyoming Valley, anthracite mining
center. All available slate troopers
and police moved in, prepared for a
long stay.
It started when insurgent non-
AFL miners union organized 45,000
men, thumbed its nose at potent
United Mine Workers as well as
NRA; yesterday the fight to a finish
began, general strike was called.
Somewhat bewildered, mine op
erators don't know what to do, will
let warring miners do the dirty
work first. Well-armed state police
will protect all who want to work.
