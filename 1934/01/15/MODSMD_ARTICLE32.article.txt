Once again it five's the Daily pleasure to thank Hie
I niversitv administration for acting on .behalf of the stu
dents. The latest kindness was the action to enlarge the
telephone system to accommodate a great influx in calls
since the arrival of three hundred additional coeds on the
Farm.'
The increase of women on the campus is, in itself, no
minor tiling. Hut when their coming necessitates such rad
ical innovations as higger and better telephone service,
then we come to the realization that Stanford "ain't what
if used to he."
This incidental thing is only one indication that the
lifting of the ban on the .">OO is due to cause many a wild
thought to wander through the minds of grads returning
for a visit here.

The Daii.y Stair will meet today at 1:1.") o'clock. The
Kditorial Hoard has two big surprises. Satisfy that longing
with a nice cool meeting no harsh irritants: not many,
that is.
