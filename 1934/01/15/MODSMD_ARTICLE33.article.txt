# CAMPUS OPINION
## CIVIL WAR IN THE ROBLE BASTILLE! 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
II has been born—the split and
schism that will widen into an in
evitable chasm. The women of the
campus have tottered to the brink,
poised on the edge, and plunged
into an annual disaster —a disaster |
which from now on will assume j
greater proportions.
Friday was pledge night—the cul
mination of three or four months of
anxious planning and scheming and
one week of frenzied engagements 1
and hectic mental gymnastics. It is
not that that is undesirable. The
objectionable feature is yet to come. '
Just six years ago, lacking two
days, there was printed in the Daily i
a strong article setting forth this oh- ;
jectionable feature and advocating !
it:> abolition. The article was writ- \
ten by Winston Norman. No doubt \
most of the student body has heard 1
oi" it; probably few have read it. j
It was a big problem in those days j
and with the increase of women, de- 1
spite plans for a new women's dor- j
mitory, it has become greater.
Even Weenie Norman suggested 1
small living groups for all the
women "with the Greek letters !
rubbed off the doorsteps," but that '
would barely lessen the difficulty, i
Nothing short of dormitory life, with
clubs such as the men's eating dubs !
within the halls, will eradicate the
cvjl. And with plans afoot for re
modeling and enlarging sorority !
houses, the problem is acute.
It is useless to attempt to para
phrase Weenie Norman. I can only
ouote excerpts from his famous
Bull Session of January 17, 1929,
"The Caste System," written the day
after pledging ....
"This is a day of broken hearts, j

Hoble Hall is full of them.
"The last returns are in, and yes
tciday numerous young ladies wept
tears of joy as, entering their future
Stanford homes amidst general oscu
lation, they were greeted as pledges
by the Sisterhoods.
"But many another young lady, in
the darkness of her room at Roble,
wept tears of bitterness last night,
knowing at last that her dream of
many years was shattered, that she
would neve.- wear the cherished Pin,
that the Roble Bastille would be her
home throughout her Stanford days.
"A few, a very few, stay in Roble
because they want to. Some stay
because they would have only one
Fir»and no other, and it was not of
fered them. Others stay—just be
cause.
"Next year some of them will not
come back. They will take their
broken hearts somewhere else. The
rest will return, philosophical, apa
thetic or defiant.
"This morning, between the room
n.ate who pledged and the room
mate who did not, the relationship
is somewhat different; and as weeks
pass the gulf will widen. The new
sister-to-be will be dropping up to
the House for lunch, and there will
be the flurry of affairs, and finally,
initiation. Their college worlds will
be different.
"Stanford is supposedly famous
for its democracy. Among the men
this is true. But it is absolutely im
possible for Stanford women to be
democratic, even though they may
wish to be, under the present Roble
—or—Row situation.
"In othrr words, sororities at
Stanford should be abolished."
