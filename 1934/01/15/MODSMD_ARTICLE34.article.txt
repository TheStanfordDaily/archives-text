# CRIMINAL ASSAULT ON AN OLD CONSTITUTION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
There is a third class of Republi
cans which you have overlooked in
your smug classification, namely the
Republicans who realize that it is
constitutional suicide to sit back and
Wf.it for the courts to protect the
rights of the individual and whose
foresight has found expression in
criticism of the dangerous trend of
the Administration.
The constitution is still a workable
instrument, as proved by the enact
ment and repeal of the eighteenth
amendment; therefore there is no
i.eed for any President to govern

unconstitutionally, or intimidate the
courts.
The fundamental purpose of the
founders of the constitution was to
otect the people from the exercise
of arbitrary powers and temporary
whims of the government holding
office. The founders knew from the
history of the seventeenth century
that despots rose to power thrdugh
the plea of meeting an emergency.
The recent victory of constitutional
government shows that there is no
need, no excuse, for the adoption of
unconstitutional measures under the
pica of an emergency.
â€”Sallie Taber, '37
