# SACRED ARE THE RIGHTS OF RIPARIANISM
## 
### 
Editor's Note: The present Campus
Opinion war in re riparianism leaves
many cold. A light, perhaps, is Mr.
N. Webster's view: Riparian rights
involve the right of an individual
owning property along a stream to
take water from the stream. Gripe:
those in the mountains dam streams;
lower owners get less water.

The Editor, Sir:
Regarding Riparian Rights: Miller
and Lux are standing upon rights
as valid as owning a stand of tim
-1 ier or a gold mine, and to challenge
them is to challenge the institution
of private property. To deprive Mil
ler and Lux of these, rights would
probably end in the states owning
cne of its most extensive properties
and therefore losing much in taxes,
because the water, as valuable to
M. & L. as the arid iands, is abso
lutely needed, free, if these lands
can make bare expenses. To force
M. & L. to lug water would be like
owning a home paying taxes, and
being forced to pay rent.
The whole Central Valley Water
Project is the greatest farce ever
slipped over upon the stupid people.
The farmers may need the water,
even if they do plow up cotton all
through the San Joaquin area, but
the whole scheme has been based

'upon absolute lies from politicians.
Almost every point they brought up
in their argument may "be proven to
Ibe untrue. Following the inspiring
J lead of Harry Chandler and Willie
Hearst, and countless scheming radio
, talkers, the people put the rope
! around their neck and jumped.
Anyone endorsing the C. V. W. # P.
will give one or more of these claims
which have been heard by every
body; first, that the project will be
| self-paying; secondly, that it will
distribute power cheaply through
. the municipal companies, thus
j breaking down that out-worn boo
|gey, the so-called "Power Trust";
I thirdly, it was claimed to put 25,000
I unemployed to work, and, of course,
;to furnish water for anhydrous
i farmers. Those were the claims,
i Now some simple information
I which anyone interested may ob
itt:n. In California there are 34 large
water districts from the Kern to the
Si cramento. All of these are pub
licly owned, all were similar in gen
eral structure to the state project,
and in every case similar claims
; were made when these 34 districts
v.ere formed. It is enlightening to
I know that of all these 34, exactly
seven arc solvent today. Also, these
seven, of all the 34 were the ones
which let their power contracts orig

inally to private companies. The
ethers distributed municipally, and
where are they? In many counties,
the land is almost one-fourth owned
by irrigation districts, notably Mer
ced County, because of delinquent
taxes.
Again, in regard to unemployed.
The great Boulder Dam, costing
10,000,000 only employs about 7,000
men, and still our own 17,000,000
C. V. W. P. will provide employ
ment for 23,000 men. Isn't it won
derful?
Also it is a self-paying project—
no doubt that is why anyone who
cares to read the law can see that
money for the interest and sinking
fund, comes from general state
funds, first; the school tax and from

the gasoline tax if needed. Just
read it yourself!
And, finally, when Los Angeles
formed the 240,000,000 Metropolitan
Water District to bring water from
the Boulder Dam, a bigger project
than the state's, they were consid
erate enough not to bond the Palo
Alto railroad station and the Hum- j
boldt Co. court house. They had '
the consideration to only bond the
counties getting the benefits of the I
Woter, while the state will tax
everywhere, including 40 per cent of
the population which lives south of
the Tehachapis won't even feel a
tcol breeze.
This is the most unjust part of
all, if San Joaquin Valley wants
dams, let them pay for their dams.
Enough. — H. C. Eonsall, Jr.
