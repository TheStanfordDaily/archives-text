# AFTER THE FRIDAY KILLINGS—"THE CORONER'S JURY"
## 
### 
The time has come, the Kappa said,
To think of many things—
Of paint and guff and nice new
frocks,
And freshmen dopes and things.
What now, what now, the D. G.
moaned—
We'll want a larger class;
And now our neighbors up the Row
Are building new rooms fast.
And if they build, and we do not,
We're in an awful fix—
We'll have a class that's not so hot,
They'll leave us in the sticks.
So the time is nigh, the Chi O tells,
To wear your Sunday best—
To rush and pledge and ring Ihe
bells, '
For now we meet the test.
The time is here, the Theta cried,
To think of many dings—
To ramp and rant and tear your
hair,
And say the vilest things.
Eut why, oh wliy, the Tri Delt asks,
Should freshmen worry much?
Who cares, who cares for brand new
baths,
Or annexes and such?
The happy days are near again,
An Alpha Phi declared
' We saw her at the five and ten —
If only we had dared—"

We wonder what we may have
missed,
The Pi Phi gals did say.
When rushing comes, we can't resist
To rush the live-long day!
Why all this secret pledging,
Recalled a Gamma Phi:
"What a charming situation—
We think we're gonna cry!"
'Tie; done, 'tis done, shout Alpha O's,
And judgment day is nigh—
We've won, we've won, we're in the
dough,
The ordeal now gone by.
Back now, we go, to Roble bower,
The campus guide advised.
Our women sit there, hour by hour,
And tears are in their eyes.
And so, last week, the Lawyer
came—
And did his heartless work.
He moweel 'em down, juft name by
name,
And few brave hearts could perk.
The hell, the hell! the campus cries!
We'll celebrate this night.
So come, come one, anel realize—
We're gonna see that light.
It matters little what you be,
But what you are and do;
So come along, rejoice—you're free!!
This means you—and you and
you!

bells, '
For now we meet the test.
The time is here, the Theta cried,
To think of many dings—
To ramp and rant and tear your
hair,
And say the vilest things.
Eut why, oh wliy, the Tri Delt asks,
Should freshmen worry much?
Who cares, who cares for brand new
baths,
Or annexes and such?
The happy days are near again,
An Alpha Phi declared
' We saw her at the five and ten —
If only we had dared—"

We wonder what we may have
missed,
The Pi Phi gals did say.
When rushing comes, we can't resist
To rush the live-long day!
Why all this secret pledging,
Recalled a Gamma Phi:
"What a charming situation—
We think we're gonna cry!"
'Tie; done, 'tis done, shout Alpha O's,
And judgment day is nigh—
We've won, we've won, we're in the
dough,
The ordeal now gone by.
Back now, we go, to Roble bower,
The campus guide advised.
Our women sit there, hour by hour,
And tears are in their eyes.
And so, last week, the Lawyer
came—
And did his heartless work.
He moweel 'em down, juft name by
name,
And few brave hearts could perk.
The hell, the hell! the campus cries!
We'll celebrate this night.
So come, come one, anel realize—
We're gonna see that light.
It matters little what you be,
But what you are and do;
So come along, rejoice—you're free!!
This means you—and you and
you!
—The "Looking Glass"
The time has come, the Kappa said,
To think of many things—
Of paint and guff and nice new
frocks,
And freshmen dopes and things.
What now, what now, the D. G.
moaned—
We'll want a larger class;
And now our neighbors up the Row
Are building new rooms fast.
And if they build, and we do not,
We're in an awful fix—
We'll have a class that's not so hot,
They'll leave us in the sticks.
So the time is nigh, the Chi O tells,
To wear your Sunday best—
To rush and pledge and ring Ihe
bells, '
For now we meet the test.
The time is here, the Theta cried,
To think of many dings—
To ramp and rant and tear your
hair,
And say the vilest things.
