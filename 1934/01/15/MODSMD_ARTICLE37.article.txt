# BULL SESSION
## THE 						TIME HAS COME 
### 
Sorority rushing has added "the
138" to the growing list of Stanford's
r.vmerological classifications. Like
the "500,'' and more especially the
"800," the new group has brought ,
with it a wardrobe trunk of pressing
problems.
Such worries as the Bawl-out, ad
mission requirements, and San Fran
cisco parties have undoubtedly
caused some to suffer intellectual
embarrassment. But the "136" has
caused something more real and
more pitiful: bitter, crushingly femi
nine tears.
Outwardly, at least, the Farm's
administration has done nothing
which will actually ease the salty ;
sling of the Roble maiden's tears.
Each of those biting droplets must
.soar the conscience of Stanford of- :
ficialdom.
To us it appears that the editorial
solution: to abolish all sororities—is
caually blind.
Abolitionists unnecessarily assume
that sorority life and snobbery are
inseparable bedfellows. That is cy
nical rather than factual. The de
sire for intimate assocation can be
satisfied without the present defect.
There appears but one course left:
AI.LOW MORE SORORITIES ON

THE FARM. It is ridiculous to as
sume that the Nine Sorority System
— bad enough with only the "500"—
can efficiently cope with "800"
women, and God only knows how
many more. An administration
which reasons that sororities in gen
eral are bad—and therefore the
fewer the better, is not facing the
facts squarely. For if sororities are
bad, the smaller the number of
houses in proportion to the number
of women, the more unbearable the
situation becomes.
At U.C.L.A., where Hilgarde Ave
nue is literally thick with sororities,
snobbery is on the wane. It is so
cially approved not to join a soror
ity.
It may be asked: Why all the anx
iety to join a house? The nature of
the female must answer that. That,
nature, however, will not change by
disregarding the whole problem.
If Stanford women desire this
type of intimate association, why
not let them have it? It seems un
i necessarily cruel to satisfy this gre
garious urge of the few—and leave
the many with a moaning suppres
sion. The larger A.W.S. grows, the
more cruel the situation becomes.
With enough sororities to go
round, it will become a matter of
intellectual decision whether the
, Stanford woman chooses lo have her
dresses borrowed by Row or Hall
: sillers.
i Stanford should not feel too
i proud to emulate the Westwood so
| lution. —Dave Mellinkoff

the female must answer that. That,
nature, however, will not change by
disregarding the whole problem.
If Stanford women desire this
type of intimate association, why
not let them have it? It seems un

garious urge of the few—and leave
the many with a moaning suppres

more cruel the situation becomes.

Sorority rushing has added "the
138" to the growing list of Stanford's
r.vmerological classifications. Like
the "500,'' and more especially the
"800," the new group has brought ,
with it a wardrobe trunk of pressing
problems.
Such worries as the Bawl-out, ad
mission requirements, and San Fran
cisco parties have undoubtedly
caused some to suffer intellectual
embarrassment. But the "136" has
caused something more real and
more pitiful: bitter, crushingly femi
nine tears.
Outwardly, at least, the Farm's
administration has done nothing
which will actually ease the salty ;
sling of the Roble maiden's tears.
Each of those biting droplets must
.soar the conscience of Stanford of- :
ficialdom.
To us it appears that the editorial
solution: to abolish all sororities—is
caually blind.
Abolitionists unnecessarily assume
that sorority life and snobbery are
inseparable bedfellows. That is cy
nical rather than factual. The de
sire for intimate assocation can be
satisfied without the present defect.
There appears but one course left:
AI.LOW MORE SORORITIES ON

THE FARM. It is ridiculous to as
sume that the Nine Sorority System
— bad enough with only the "500"—
can efficiently cope with "800"
women, and God only knows how
many more. An administration
which reasons that sororities in gen
eral are bad—and therefore the
fewer the better, is not facing the
facts squarely. For if sororities are
bad, the smaller the number of
houses in proportion to the number
of women, the more unbearable the
situation becomes.
At U.C.L.A., where Hilgarde Ave
nue is literally thick with sororities,
snobbery is on the wane. It is so
cially approved not to join a soror
ity.
It may be asked: Why all the anx
iety to join a house? The nature of
the female must answer that. That,
nature, however, will not change by
disregarding the whole problem.
