Stanford basketball team, Coacl
John Bunn's cagers slaughtered the
U.C.L.A. Bruins 45 to 26 Fridaj
night only to be nosed out 32 to 3]
on Saturday in a surprising Blue
and Gold comeback.
In Friday's game Topping slippec
through seven field goals and foui
foul shots for a personal total of 1£
points. The following evening, how
ever', Stanford's rangy forward wai
held to a scant six points, which
plus a last minute U.C.L.A. rally
.' pelled defeat for the Indians.
Rough and Tumble
Saturday's encounter was of the
rough and tumble variety with
Stanford holding the advantage un
til the last few minutes of play
Both Topping and Charlie Rogers
guard, went out of the game or
fouls, weakening the Indians in the
decisive, last-half finale when the
Bruins rej.se up in wrath and turned
the tables on the Stanfordites.
With about five minutes to go,
while Stanford held an apparently
sail,- 31 to 24 lead, Captain Don Piper
of the Bruins v/as sent out of the;
game with four personal fouls. Ap
parently taking this as a personal
affront, U.C.L.A.'s lively bunch of
sophomores revenged themselves to
lh< extent of scoring eight points to
win, while holding the Indians
scoreless.
Last Minute Win
Wilbur Johns, sophomore for
ward, shot the Bruins' winning
basket in the last 30 seconds of play
and likewise garnered high point
honors for his team with nine digits,
Emil Cowing, recent junior college
transfer, lived up to pre-season
promise, scoring 11 points for Stan
ford and carrying off high point
honors for the evening. Topping
with six points, Captain Hal Edelen
with five, Mallatratt with seven, and
Cosgrove with two were responsible
for the rest of Stanford's points.
Much more satisfying from the
Stanford perspective was Friday
rught's game in which the Indians
ran wild to outdistance the helpless
Bruins by almost 20 points. Side
line cynics who had peremptorily
consigned the Indians to the un
enviable cellar position in the con
ference race looked on in surprise
while Coach Bunn's quintet pro
ceeded to prove itself so clearly su
perior to the Bruins.
L'O to 9 Lead
Getting off to an early six to noth
ing leael the Indians ran it up to a 20
to 9 advantage at the half. Easing
up on the defense somewhat while
putting on the pressure offensively
in the second half; Stanford finished
up the game on the long end of a
45 to 26 score.

lh< extent of scoring eight points to
win, while holding the Indians
scoreless.
Last Minute Win
Wilbur Johns, sophomore for
ward, shot the Bruins' winning
basket in the last 30 seconds of play
and likewise garnered high point
honors for his team with nine digits,
Emil Cowing, recent junior college
transfer, lived up to pre-season
promise, scoring 11 points for Stan
ford and carrying off high point
honors for the evening. Topping
with six points, Captain Hal Edelen
with five, Mallatratt with seven, and
Cosgrove with two were responsible
for the rest of Stanford's points.
Much more satisfying from the
Stanford perspective was Friday
rught's game in which the Indians
ran wild to outdistance the helpless
Bruins by almost 20 points. Side
line cynics who had peremptorily
consigned the Indians to the un
enviable cellar position in the con
ference race looked on in surprise
while Coach Bunn's quintet pro
ceeded to prove itself so clearly su
perior to the Bruins.
L'O to 9 Lead
Getting off to an early six to noth
ing leael the Indians ran it up to a 20
to 9 advantage at the half. Easing
up on the defense somewhat while
putting on the pressure offensively
in the second half; Stanford finished
up the game on the long end of a
45 to 26 score.

Indicating lhat as Keith Tapping
r.oes so goes the 1934 edition of the
Stanford basketball team, Coacl
John Bunn's cagers slaughtered the
U.C.L.A. Bruins 45 to 26 Fridaj
night only to be nosed out 32 to 3]
on Saturday in a surprising Blue
and Gold comeback.
In Friday's game Topping slippec
through seven field goals and foui
foul shots for a personal total of 1£
points. The following evening, how
ever', Stanford's rangy forward wai
held to a scant six points, which
plus a last minute U.C.L.A. rally
.' pelled defeat for the Indians.
Rough and Tumble
Saturday's encounter was of the
rough and tumble variety with
Stanford holding the advantage un
til the last few minutes of play
Both Topping and Charlie Rogers
guard, went out of the game or
fouls, weakening the Indians in the
decisive, last-half finale when the
Bruins rej.se up in wrath and turned
the tables on the Stanfordites.
With about five minutes to go,
while Stanford held an apparently
sail,- 31 to 24 lead, Captain Don Piper
of the Bruins v/as sent out of the;
game with four personal fouls. Ap
parently taking this as a personal
affront, U.C.L.A.'s lively bunch of
sophomores revenged themselves to
lh< extent of scoring eight points to
win, while holding the Indians
scoreless.
Last Minute Win
Wilbur Johns, sophomore for
ward, shot the Bruins' winning
basket in the last 30 seconds of play
and likewise garnered high point
honors for his team with nine digits,
Emil Cowing, recent junior college
transfer, lived up to pre-season
promise, scoring 11 points for Stan
ford and carrying off high point
honors for the evening. Topping
with six points, Captain Hal Edelen
with five, Mallatratt with seven, and
Cosgrove with two were responsible
for the rest of Stanford's points.
Much more satisfying from the
Stanford perspective was Friday
rught's game in which the Indians
ran wild to outdistance the helpless
Bruins by almost 20 points. Side
line cynics who had peremptorily
consigned the Indians to the un
enviable cellar position in the con
ference race looked on in surprise
while Coach Bunn's quintet pro
ceeded to prove itself so clearly su
perior to the Bruins.
L'O to 9 Lead
Getting off to an early six to noth
ing leael the Indians ran it up to a 20
to 9 advantage at the half. Easing
up on the defense somewhat while
putting on the pressure offensively
in the second half; Stanford finished
up the game on the long end of a
45 to 26 score.
