# Babe Cagers Beat Lowell
## Quade High Point Scorer In 40-15 Victory 
### 
Challenged by a scorching 26-17
defeat handed to the California
frosh by Lowell High of San Fran
eisco just the night before, Stan
ford frosh met the victor last Satur
day night and turned them back by
an impressive 40-15 margin.
Mixing in some fancy shooting
with steady, first class basketball,
acting-Captain Bill Quade rang up
nine field goals and three free
j throws totaling 21 digits, to lead his
team mates in scaring. Turner,
playing the other forward post, fed
Quade some neat passes and ac
counted for seven points himself.
Frosh Control Tip
1 The Card margin of victory was
due to the ability of the Babes to
control the tip-off. Both Beedle anel
I Williamson out-jumped the oppos
| ing center and Quade consistently
j cracked through to tap the ball out
to Zamloch at guard.
Coach Chuck Glascow's innova
j tion, Turner and Zamloch trading
positions on defense, to give the
frosh three tall men under the bas
; ket, was 100 per cent effective
; against, the Lowell cagers. In the
end the Cardinals had to be satis
fied with their shots from the middle
; court, and Turner made their
i chances for follow-up shots negligi
ble by picking the sphere neatly off
*he back-board time after time.
Lowell Uninspired
For Lowell, Johnson, Meyers, and
Troppman played consistent ball,
jhut two hard games in two nights
1 showeel up in the desultory play of
the Cardinals during the final frame.
With the ball game safely in the
1 bag, Glasgow turned the fourth
I quarter over to the reserves, and
all members of the Indian squad
saw service. Randall showed keen
; handling of the ball and Erlenheim
an aggressive spirit that should al
low these two guards to see plenty
of action in the coming games.
Tomorrow night the Babes meet
the Santa Clara frosh in the pre
liminary to the Card-Bronco varsity
clash.
