# STANFORD, SAN JOSE RUGBY TEAMS BATTLE TO SCORELESS DEADLOCK
## 
### 
The local rugby season got awfiy
to a bad start from both team and
spectators' viewpoint when San Jose
held the Stanford club to a score-
U.es tie here Saturday. The visitors
; ure an ambitious and willing lot,
but they have attained about the
| same stage of technical develop
j mtnt that Stanford possessed at this
| time l«ist year.
The result was a slow game, not
at all representative of good rugger,
with frequent interruptions by the
referee, and little or none of the
spectacular element. Hard play and
i aggressiveness was established by
San Jose from the very first play,
and the Indians us well fell to with
I a readiness.
Backs Bottled Up
i Offside play by both teams hin
dered the proper recovery of the
ball from the scrum, the brilliant
Slanford backfield was practically
shackeled at the ankles, never ob
taining the ball on a clean break
that would have allowed them to
I scamper down field on a co-ordi
nated passing rush. Fleet Johnny
Reisner,' playing right wing for
Stanford, hardly took the ball on a
pass at all during the first half.
The encounter resolved itself into
a struggle of the forwards, with an
occasional kicking sortie by the
i backfield. The expert work in this
latter department of Lee Irelan, f all -
; back, and Ray Lewis, first five for
Stanford, bottled up San Jose in
i their own defensive territory.
Lewis Attempts Kick
On one occasion Ray Lewis at
tempted a drop kick from play out
| about mid-field, and came near
driving it square and true. Johnny
Hitchcock fell on the ball over the
goal line for an apparent try, but
l the ball had grazed the goal post
j and was ruled dead by the referee.
If Lewis had made good that kick,
1 it would be something to talk about,
being similar to the one Dink Tem
pleton put over on France when
playing on the American Olympic
j self in the east end of the stadium
i and proceeded to watch some of his
j former players star. Ben Pala
j mountain and Jack Hillman showed

lup well in the Stanford scrum,
'while Jay Tod was holding down
ccnter three for San Jose.

The local rugby season got awfiy
to a bad start from both team and
spectators' viewpoint when San Jose
held the Stanford club to a score-
U.es tie here Saturday. The visitors
; ure an ambitious and willing lot,
but they have attained about the
| same stage of technical develop
j mtnt that Stanford possessed at this
| time l«ist year.
The result was a slow game, not
at all representative of good rugger,
with frequent interruptions by the
referee, and little or none of the
spectacular element. Hard play and
i aggressiveness was established by
San Jose from the very first play,
and the Indians us well fell to with
I a readiness.
Backs Bottled Up
i Offside play by both teams hin
dered the proper recovery of the
ball from the scrum, the brilliant
Slanford backfield was practically
shackeled at the ankles, never ob
taining the ball on a clean break
that would have allowed them to
I scamper down field on a co-ordi
nated passing rush. Fleet Johnny
Reisner,' playing right wing for
Stanford, hardly took the ball on a
pass at all during the first half.
The encounter resolved itself into
a struggle of the forwards, with an
occasional kicking sortie by the
i backfield. The expert work in this
latter department of Lee Irelan, f all -
; back, and Ray Lewis, first five for
Stanford, bottled up San Jose in
i their own defensive territory.
Lewis Attempts Kick
On one occasion Ray Lewis at
tempted a drop kick from play out
| about mid-field, and came near
driving it square and true. Johnny
Hitchcock fell on the ball over the
goal line for an apparent try, but
l the ball had grazed the goal post
j and was ruled dead by the referee.
If Lewis had made good that kick,
1 it would be something to talk about,
being similar to the one Dink Tem
pleton put over on France when
playing on the American Olympic
j self in the east end of the stadium
i and proceeded to watch some of his
j former players star. Ben Pala
