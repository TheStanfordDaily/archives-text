NIGHT FLIGHT (MGM)
At the California Theatre
This film is unique in several re
spects, its principal distinction lying
in the fact that it is the only one of
the long series of all-star films in
which "galaxy" (as the press agents
would have it) of stars is not pre
dominant over the narrative interest.
This story of the South American
night mail plane service has the mail
rervice as its hero and the elements
as the villain; the players are subor
dinate, and yet they are just notice
able enough to make it patent that,
with a cast of unknown players,
"Night Flight" might have been epic.
The story is an unusual one, deal
ing with the beginnings of night mail
i service, and it is told simply and

! earnestly, with excellent effect. It
; is episodic in the extreme, and yet
! it seems naturally so. There are
many good sequences, notably the
climax in which Clark Gable suc
cessfully flies through stormy
weather into a peaceful sky, only to
| t rash when his gas gives out.
The photography is, as can be im
agined, excellent, and serves ma
terially to enhance the narrative.
Among the players, Helen Hayes
I is perhaps outstanding, though her
j performance is obviously cut off the
i same mold as many of her previous

efforts. Clark Gable, though seated
in the cockpit of the plane through
out the film, makes his best impres
sion in some time; his is a genuine
piece of work.
The brothers Barrymore appear to
less advantage, particularly Lionel,
who seems somewhat miscast, and
who fidgets vaguely through a fool
ish role. John, on the other hand,
thunders through his with little of
the subtlety that one might rightly
hope for. Robert Montgomery, Myr
na Loy, and William Gargan appear
J briefly, but convincingly. â€”ChapiTi
