# Bears Beaten By SC In 42 to 19 Surprise Win
## 
### 
Holding the Bears scoreless for 19
and a half minutes, S.C.'s basketball
five smothered the California cage
team 42 to 19 in a surprising come
back Saturday night after having I
lost to the Blue and Gold men on
Friday, 36 to 30. Airtight defensive
work by Kelly and Bescos plus 20*
points scored by brilliant Lee Gut
tero proved too much for the Bears
on Saturday.
