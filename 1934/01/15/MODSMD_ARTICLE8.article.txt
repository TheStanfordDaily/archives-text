# ADDED TRUNKS TO AID CAMPUS PHONE SYSTEM
## Two New Lines to Be Added To Toyon Switchboard, Announces Irwin SURVEY BEING MADE Union Problem Not Solved, Says Miss Price 
### Russell Paine 
Two new trunk lines and two
inter-hall phones are being added to
the Toyon telephone switchboard
I system and will probably be in
stalled Monday morning, announces
Assistant Comptroller Ernest Ste
phen Erwin.
The increased facilities were ne
cessitated because of the problem
caused by the 80 new women in the
Union dormitory. Originated by the
Daily, the discussion of telephone
troubles caused much interest oil the
campus last week. During rush
hours, from 5:30 to 8 o'clock in the
evening, the Toyon board had been
incapable of handling all the incom
ing calls, and as a result service
was poor.
Temporary Measure
With the increased lines there will
be four trunks for outgoing calls
only, eight for outgoing and incom
ing calls, and three inter-hall com
munication lines. Also there will be
a plain house telephone put in from
the Union to the switchboard to aid
in summoning Union women to the
lobby of the Union.
These added trunks are only a
temporary measure, emphasized As
sistant Comptroller Erwin. A survey
is now being started by the tele
phone company to determine the
actual needs on the campus; and
suggestions will be made to the Uni
versity's administration.
Asked what she thought of the
additions, Miss Louise Price, direc
tor of the Union Unit, said, "I think
this will help, but it does not solve
the entire problem for the Union."
Messengers Needed
There is no one in the Union to
take packages, messages, or any
communications in the Union except
the women themselves who volun
tarily serve in this capacity part
time. If there were a telephone
switchboard in the Union, Miss
Price said, the employees of the
board could take car'j of all mes
sages and callers as is done at Pioble.
The question is, she explained,
"whether it is more advantageous to
have a centralized or a decentral
ized telephone system." She ex
pressed herself in favor of the sur
vey to find out the exact needs of
the halls.
Said Sam Freeman, switchboard
operator: "I think the new lines will
ease up the telephone system."
