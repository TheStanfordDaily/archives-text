"If you want to earn extra money, or
your tuition, I recommend tennis rack
et restringiag as the business for you.
"I got my start with TOMGUT
'Court-Tested' Tennis Strings. I sent
80c for TOMGUT silk string, enough
to string my racket—liked it so well
that I started stringing other fellows'
rackets with it—then I was in the
rcstringing business."
Just send 80c to the THOMPSON
MFG. CO., 45th Place and Packers
Ave., Chicago, and one 37-ft. coil
(enough for one racket) of TOMGUT
"Court - Tested" Tennis String in
white, orange, green or Spirals (red
and white or blue and white), will be
sent you postpaid, with a TOMGUT
tennis string price-list. Try TOM
GUT in your racket—see for yourself
what a real value it is. First thing
you know you'll be stringing other
fellows' rackets for profit. Right now
is a great time to get started!
