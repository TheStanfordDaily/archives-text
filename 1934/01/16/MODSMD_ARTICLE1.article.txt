Professor of New Deal Economics,
F.R., took pointer in hand yester
day, and special messaged boys and

ation of the dollar to between 50 and
GO cents.
Almost immediately the national
treasury fixed gold at $34.45, actually
setting the doddering dollar at the
GO-cent figure.
Democrats were characteristically
gleeful at receipt of the message;
.Republicans scurried to a hasty
pow-wow to decide whether or not
they liked the Idea.
F.R.'s "request" took the form of
a class lesson in advanced econ, ex
plained that free circulation of gold
was unnecessary, except for pay
ment of international trade bal
ances. In his own words, the move
was to "maintain the credit of the
government," "provide a sound me
dium of exchange."

Britishers were flabbergasted by
the Roosevelt pronouncement. Jour
nals headlined: "Washington Gold
Grabbers"; cabinet feared dumping

marked that this was but the public
notice of F.D.'s constant policy.
