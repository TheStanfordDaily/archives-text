# Wide Acclaim Is Predicted For Baritone
## Thomas Returns to Series After 1932 Triumph 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
A full evening's program of selec
tions so varied in nature that none
will fail to regard the offering as
entertainment and artistry of the
highest orderâ€”that is the forecast
for Thursday's Concert Series, in
which John Charles Thomas will
return to the Stanford Pavilion,
where he secured so pronounced a
triumph in the spring of 1932.
At that time, according to re
views,
"Unending clapping and stamp
ing by a practically full house,
reluctant to leave, was ample evi
dence of the esteem and apprecia
tion granted the famous singer."
Tibbett Rival
Thomas contests only with the
more - widely - publicized Lawrence
Tibbett for the position of foremost
American baritone, and the two
naturally have frequently appeared
in similar operatic Unlike Tib
bett, Thomas has never appeared on
the screen, but has rather divided his
activities between comic opera,
grand opera, and concert singing.
The latter field seems to appeal to
the singer more, as offering a great
variety of moods in a single hearing.
Versatility has been the key
note of Thomas' life, and is like
wise the keynote of his Stanford
concert. Choir singing, medical
study, and college athletics oc
cupied Thomas in his prc-opera
days, and provided him with a rich
background of practical experi
ence. In his concerts, the baritone
frequently includes selections in
four languages: English, French,
Italian, and German.
"Traviata" Debut
With current interest in the Met
ropolitan Opera Company intensi
fied by the transcontinental broad
cast, it is interesting to note that
Thomas, following his Stanford and
San Francisco engagements, will go
directly to the Metropolitan, there
to make his New York debut in
Verdi's "La Traviata." This comes
as a climax to numerous operatic
engagements in Chicago, Philadel
phia, London, Brussels, Los Ange
les, and various other metropolitan
cities.
