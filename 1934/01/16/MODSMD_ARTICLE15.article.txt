# INDIAN CAGERS BATTLE BRONC SQUAD TONIGHT
## Santa Clarans Handicapped By Size; Returning Grid Stars Bolster Roster 
### 
Offering a review to Indian hopp
fans before the first California game
Saturday, Stanford's surprising bas
ketball squad makes its first Farm
appearance tonight when they meet
Santa Clara in a non-conference
game.
After their performance in Los
Angeles last week-end, the Indians
;can only be called surprising. North
jern critics were already relegating
Stanford to the cellar position on the |
[strength of a mediocre pre-season j
record when they trounced U.C.L.A. j
45 to 27 in their first game.
World Beater Cards
Hailed as world beaters by south- ,
cm papers, Stanford about faced
and dropped the second game by a
one-point margin after holding a
seven-point lead two minutes before
the final gun.
The Indians showed great poten
tialities in both games, but inexpe
rience and the excitement of the
closing minutes of the second U.C.
L.A. battle caused them to forget
safe play and the Bruins were able
to take advantage of the breaks af-
I forded them by the Stanford at
tempts to increase their lead.
The Broncos have been handi-
I capped by lack of size but this may
Ibe remedied tonight by the return
j to the squad of three football play-
I ers, just back from Hawaii with the
j grid squad. The three, Sobrero, Sa
| latino, and Arnerich, were regulars
i last season and may oust some of
I the inexperienced sophomores in to
i night's starting line-up.
Same Lineup
Coach John Bunn will probably
j start the same five for Stanford that
opened the U.C.L.A. games. This
I team was made up of Topping and
' Cowing, forwards; Captain Edelen,
[ center; and Mallatratt and Rogers,
I guards. Gorter will also see plenty
of action in one of the forward po
sitions.
Both A1 Page and Jack Cosgrove,
incapacitated guards, will be ready
for action, but will not start. Gordy
Mallatratt, who filled in for Page in
the southern games, was said to be
ione of the outstanding men on the
floor, and next to Topping's sensa
tional shooting in the first game, his
play was the most talked of by Los
Angeles fans.
A1 Hershcy, lanky center, whose
bad shoulder is finally responding to
treatment, may make his debut to
night. His height would add weapon
to the Indian team.

Both A1 Page and Jack Cosgrove,
incapacitated guards, will be ready
for action, but will not start. Gordy
Mallatratt, who filled in for Page in
the southern games, was said to be
ione of the outstanding men on the
floor, and next to Topping's sensa
tional shooting in the first game, his
play was the most talked of by Los
Angeles fans.
A1 Hershcy, lanky center, whose
bad shoulder is finally responding to
treatment, may make his debut to
night. His height would add weapon
to the Indian team.
Offering a review to Indian hopp
fans before the first California game
Saturday, Stanford's surprising bas
ketball squad makes its first Farm
appearance tonight when they meet
Santa Clara in a non-conference
game.
After their performance in Los
Angeles last week-end, the Indians
;can only be called surprising. North
jern critics were already relegating
Stanford to the cellar position on the |
[strength of a mediocre pre-season j
record when they trounced U.C.L.A. j
45 to 27 in their first game.
World Beater Cards
Hailed as world beaters by south- ,
cm papers, Stanford about faced
and dropped the second game by a
one-point margin after holding a
seven-point lead two minutes before
the final gun.
The Indians showed great poten
tialities in both games, but inexpe
rience and the excitement of the
closing minutes of the second U.C.
L.A. battle caused them to forget
safe play and the Bruins were able
to take advantage of the breaks af-
I forded them by the Stanford at
tempts to increase their lead.
The Broncos have been handi-
I capped by lack of size but this may
Ibe remedied tonight by the return
j to the squad of three football play-
I ers, just back from Hawaii with the
j grid squad. The three, Sobrero, Sa
| latino, and Arnerich, were regulars
i last season and may oust some of
I the inexperienced sophomores in to
i night's starting line-up.
Same Lineup
Coach John Bunn will probably
j start the same five for Stanford that
opened the U.C.L.A. games. This
I team was made up of Topping and
' Cowing, forwards; Captain Edelen,
[ center; and Mallatratt and Rogers,
I guards. Gorter will also see plenty
of action in one of the forward po
sitions.
