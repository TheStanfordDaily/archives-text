# Campus Fireman Saves Troubled Theta Pledge
## 
### 
"Fireman, .<-ave our child,' begged
j Kappa Alpha Thetas over the phone
i at the cold hour of 3:30 o'clock Sat
urday morning—just a few hours
after Hfill had gone Row and all
I was supposedly quiet, on the soror
j ity front.
But the Thetas weren't quiet.
I "Come up right away," they urged
| the smoke-eater on guard at the
| campus firehousc. "You'd better
| bring a crow-bar. One of our pledges
j is in difficulty."
The fireman, agog at the myste
i lious nature of the call, dashed up
I the How equipped with an axe, a
j crow-bar, and a fellow fireman—
just for safety.
The rescuers were escorted by ex
cited, pajama-clad sisters to the fire

escape off the sleeping porch where
a newly pledged freshman was
stuck, one foot and leg firmly caught
in the iron grating. Prying the bars
apart was not much of a job for the
firemen, who, when not fighting
blazes, would just as soon be res
cuing Thetas.
How the pledge got on the fire
escape has not been fully explained.
Maybe she was trying to get back
to Roble, maybe, as the sisters
hinted, it was the unfortunate out
come of a pledge stunt.
"There was something funny about
it," said the knight-errant fireman
when interviewed yesterday. "There
was the girl stuck in the grating,
and next to her on the fire escape
were a desk lamp, a bowl of water,
and four other girls."
