# One Down

### 
Chicago's drive against gangsters
lost another round yesterday as a
band of machine gun bandits calmly
looted the First National Bank in
spite of the screamings of the bur
glar alarm, opened fire on a squad
of police officers when their work
was interrupted, drilled one patrol
man dead, broke through the ring
representing the law, fled in a flurry
of bullets with $25,000.
