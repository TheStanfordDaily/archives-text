# 'Pledge Prom' Late Lockouts Given O.K. By Women's Council
## Administrators Pleased As Houses Are Reconciled To Campus Dance 
### 
With :i::30 o'clock lockouts granted
yesterday by the Women's Council,
plans rapidly drawn into shape give,
promise of a record-breaking pre
cedent-setting "Pledge Prom" in the
Women's Gym and Dance Studio
Friday night.
"The special late leaves have been
granted in order to give every op
portunity to make the affair a suc
cess," explained Marion Storey,
speaking for the Council. "It should
be understood that they apply only
for this dance, and that women going
to the city that night must comply
with the regular 2:uo o'clock lock
out."
Dance Informal
The dance, planned at present, will
be informal, will start at 10 o'clock
and end with breakfast served
shortly before the 3:30 o'clock dead
line.
Administrative heads of the Uni
versity have all expressed favorable
views, both as to the Interfraternity
Council's action in voting to hold a
campus dance, and to the plans sub
mitted by them for the dance.
President Kay Lyman Wilbur, con
tacted yesterday, wholeheartedly
approved of the action taken by the
Council. "The fraternities have done
well in meeting the situation facing
them this year," he stated, "and the
plans they have shown me are first
rate."
Dean Yost Approves
Dean of Women Mary Yost said
last night: "The plans for the dance
are fine. I am delighted that the men
have showed such a co-operative
spirit in their action. We are willing
to do anything in our power to make
the pledge celebration a success."
George Bliss Culver, dean of men,
seemed equally pleased. "It's the
best thing that has happened on the
campus in some time," he said. "The
plan as outlined to me seems en
tirely satisfactory. I am particu
larly pleased that the Council has
shown its responsibility in taking the
wise action they have."
Final plans for the dance will be
completed at an eariy date this
week. Admittance to the affair will
be limited, of course, to fraternity
men, pledges, and dates.
