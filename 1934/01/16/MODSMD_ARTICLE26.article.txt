# Willis Gives Quake Facts In KPO Talk
## Tremors Likely to Occur In Five Localities 
### 
A plea of ignorance is no longer '
a valid excuse for not building for
security from earthquakes, in the
opinion of Dr. Bailey Willis, who
last night gave the second in the |
series of educational radio talks
sponsored by the University over
radio station KPO.
Earthquake Regions
Dr. Willis outlined the principal
sections of California in which
earthquakes are likely to occur,
these sections being five in number:
first, Northern California, including
Humboldt and Mendocino Counties; J
second, the territory extending from ,
the Bay region south to Santa Cruz; 1
third, the country from San Juanj
Bautista to San Luis Obispo; fourth, j
the region from Santa Barbara to
the southern border of the state; j
and fifth, the Sierra Nevada region, j
comprising the whole of the moun
tain range.
Dr. Willis termed these districts
"earthquake machines," and stressed
the fact that shakes are liable to j
occur here at almost any time.
Frame Buildings Safe
During the course of his talk, Dr.
Willis said that the safest buildings
at the present time are small frame i
and stucco houses and the great of- j
fice buildings, while the greatest j
danger to life is in the cheaply-built!
offices and apartment houses. There!
are at present about 500 buildings j
of this class in San Francisco while
| Los Angeles has approximately 2,000 j
of them. Dr. Willis expressed the 1
belief that Palo Alto is better pre
pared in the event of an earthquake j
than any other city in the state.
Dr. Willis made the statement that i
about 70 per cent of buildings in
the state are unsafe, that it is up to |
public officials to pass laws requir- j
ing stringent inspection, and to see j
that the people are educated to the
best methods of combating the i
I quakes.
