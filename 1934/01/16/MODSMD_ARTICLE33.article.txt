# THE 						TIMES VS. THE REDS
## 
### 
There arc several subjects about which we don't know
everything. This is line, as it leaves lis something to do
for next week. One of these subjects is communism, which
we understand is an experiment to try to make the com
mon people as good as their superiors, or lower the supe
rior people down to the level of the lower classes, or some
thing of that sort.
Anyhow, we don't know much about it. The liberal
weeklies think it's a line thing, the conservative journals
point with alarm. l>ut what with trying to institute various
local reforms, such as eliminating the mud puddles in the
liath to Encina, we haven't had time to decide which is
/ight.
However, we did work up an opinion regarding one
aspect of this subject. Various conservative papers such
as the Palo Alto Times, which draw their business from
conservative people, stoop pretty low when they attempt
to blame everything that goes wrong on nebulous bands
of "Reds."
When the unemployed men in a soup line objected to
the dish-watery soup given them the other night the Times
immediately referred to them as "Reds." Similarly, any
protest of poor, unemployed, or liberal groups against the
ruling classes is always referred to in the Times as a "Red"
uprising. We may not know very much about communism,
but we know enough about a certain type of journalist to
suspect that their anxiety about the communist menace is
due to the knowledge that most of their readers have
closed minds and full pocketbooks.
