# Fearless journalism a la Trojan
## 
### 
Xo longer can il he said lhal college youth is afraid to
grapple with the stirring realities of this game called Life
with a capital "L." Into the thick of the fray jumps the
Southern California Trojan head high, lists flying, heart
high, nostrils wide, temples throbbing. The perfect ex
ample of adrenalin on the rampage.
Says the Trojan: "Sunsets are among the most beauti
ful sights in the world. . . . As the sun sinks into the grey
wall of clouds . . ." And then the Herculean punch: "Sun
sets are the same today as they were in Caesar's time.
They arc wonders of the world that were gazed upon by
ancients in practically the same form as we see them today.
There is nothing so beautiful as a sunset."
The future of the world is assured. Hail America!
Hail Youth! Hail Trojan! Hail . . .
