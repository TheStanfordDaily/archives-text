There are some things that we have so customarily that
we are prone to Jake them for granted. Bromide.
For example there is the question of sunsets that we
have never fully appreciated till expounded by I lie Trojan
in the editorial quoted above.
Similarly, we have the semi-weekly organ recitals by
Warren 1). Allen in the Memorial Church. They are just
as good as the sunsets, even better after reading the I.S.C.
exposition on sunsets.
Students will do well to drop into the Church today at
1:1.") o'clock and enjoy a pleasant program.
