## TAKE THE "FIRST PAGE" OUT OF "CRITERIA" 
### 
: The Editor, Sir:
Again there are only two days left
before the deadline for acceptance
I of material for "Criteria" and again
j the editor cries for copy. I hope that
this doesn't become a habit with the
I editorial staff of our new literary
j publication for such "newspaper"
| tactics will be the sure death of any
i publication pretending to be literary.
I I would remind the editor of "Cri
| tei'ia" that genius must have time in
I order to ripen its ideas and to put
! them in acceptable form for what is
| hoped will be a literary publication
I and not just another newspaper. Any
j literary editor who stays at home
j and writes sonnets for a whole quar
i ter and then suddenly bursts forth
' three days or a week before his in
! sane deadline with a few wild cries
; for copy will not find anything really

: fit for publication unless it is his
i own material.
A really live literary editor should
set his deadline at least a month, if
not two months, ahead. Then he
must carry on a constructive and
consistant campaign for material
during the whole period. Few ama
teur writers keep a file of publish
able material which they can re
vamp for a literary journal on short
notice. And 1 am afraid that there
are a very few of those geni on the
Stanford campus who can produce
reams of really literary material on
short notice.
Stanford needs a respectable lit
erary journal. I hope that "Crite
ria" will begin to follow a dignified,
long-time editorial policy which will
give it a greater fighting chance of
becoming both respectable and lit—
