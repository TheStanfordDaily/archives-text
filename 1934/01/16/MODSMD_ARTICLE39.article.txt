DANCING LADY (MGM)
At the Stanford Theatre
Big-mouthed, pop-eyed, broad
i shouldered Joan Crawford can act,
; can dance, and looks as though she
I enjoyed doing it. It is largely her
' vitality and sincerity which make
I the picture worth seeing. Graduated
i from the Oh - God - the - pain - of-it
| school, she plays comedy with great
; joy—not with conscious cuteness
like Miriam Hopkins, nor with naive
; sweetness like Ruby Keeler, but with
| deep vigor and a vital zest all her
own. Her acting is swift—a mere
flicker from a large eye, a quick
| movement of her hand—and you be
lieve her. A fine actress is supposed
jto "lose herself" in her role. Craw
! ford and Janie*Barlow seem to have
| the same identity; I don't know
I which was lost in which.
On the other hand, Clark Gable,
I an anti-climax to 42nd Street's War-
J ner Baxter, is too conscious of his
! role as dance director and does not
[successfully ignore the fact that
some of his lines are silly. Franchot
; Tone's ingratiating smile makes him
jan effective villain in an impossible
i and thoroughly routine plot, but his
| offer of marriage destroys villainous
: potentiality.
The tempo of the picture is fast,
: and the atmosphere, enhanced by
j the characteristic MGM accessories
i of flashy nickel-plated sets and well
j groomed clothes, is sparkling and
| pleasant. The script is usually
clever, using the "Trouble in Para-
J dise" trick of leading a scene to
| ward conventional sentimentality
| and then twisting the situation with
; a bright quip until the scene almost
i laughs at itself. Direction is subtle
jin Crawford's scenes, bringing out
I realistic details which are as strik
; ing as Elmer Rice at his best. In
! rehearsal scenes, too much exag
| geration spoils any possible convinc
| ing effect. A usual quorum of stage
j spectacle at the end looks lavish and
! a great deal like other spectacles.
Added attractions: Ted Healy and
' his stooges, several good new tunes,
I a tricky dance routine by Crawford
Jand Fred Astaire, Winnie Lightner
i (not as funny as she once was). May
j Robeson and Robert Benchley .sadly
' wasted in bits.
j See the picture, if only for Craw
ford's performance. —Brauns

I enjoyed doing it. It is largely her
' vitality and sincerity which make
I the picture worth seeing. Graduated
i from the Oh - God - the - pain - of-it
| school, she plays comedy with great
; joy—not with conscious cuteness
like Miriam Hopkins, nor with naive
; sweetness like Ruby Keeler, but with
| deep vigor and a vital zest all her
own. Her acting is swift—a mere
flicker from a large eye, a quick
| movement of her hand—and you be
lieve her. A fine actress is supposed
jto "lose herself" in her role. Craw

| the same identity; I don't know

On the other hand, Clark Gable,
I an anti-climax to 42nd Street's War-

! role as dance director and does not
[successfully ignore the fact that
some of his lines are silly. Franchot

jan effective villain in an impossible
i and thoroughly routine plot, but his

: potentiality.
The tempo of the picture is fast,
