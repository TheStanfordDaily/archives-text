# BULL SESSION
## AN ACADEMIC ANTIDOTE 
### 
The spirit of argument, if not its
' form, is essential to the class-room.
By argument 1 do not mean unrea
soning opposition, but rather a will
| ingness to admit into the confines of
| the classroom a spirit of challenge
! and resistance to conformity. In
many • university courses, controver
sial subjects are studied in which
j there is very distinctly "more than
| one side to the question." In these
i studies, however, there is a tendency
for the student to observe and abide
by the opinion of the professor,
: without even knowing that a differ
ent interpretation is possible.
—;
Frequently the oratorical ability of
the professor is of such convincing
| execution and volume, that sound
' alone, trumpeting against the bat
-1 tered class-room walls, suffice to
I drown out student thought. Con
| vincing rhetoric and oratory are vir
' tues to be admired, certainly not
'discouraged. Bat they should not
'go unanswered. An academic anti-
I dote is needed; if a professor thun
i ders impressively that King So-and
!so was a blackguard, there should
! be a protesting voice which would
j meekly insert that at least some his
i torians have thought the same King
; to be "the greatest in the history of
the century."

The fear of displeasing the profes
sor makes it very nearly impossible
for this .spirit of argument to ema
nate from the students themselves.
The solution, I think, lies in the
dual-professor idea, which, in vari
ous forms, has already made its ap
pearance on the American educa
tional scene. This plan calls for the
conduct of a class by two professors
—each presenting one side of con
troversial subjects. This system, I
think, would often occasion debates
as amusing as they would be in
structive.
The suggestion is not so radical as
it may sound. It is not very diffefent
i from the preceptorial system which
!is used here in certain elementary
| courses in the School of Social Sci
ences. To be sure, there are a great
many courses in which the plan
I would be impracticable. It would
| serve little usefulness in elementary
language courses, for instance, but
it would be of enormous benefit in
courses which are essentially criti
cal, philosophical, or interpretative.
lln certain classrooms, at least, stu
j dents would learn that there are
Truths and Truths, and that very
| few of these Truths come direct from
the lips of God.
