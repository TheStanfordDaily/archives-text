# Prices Upped
## 
### 
Prices soared, new highs were hit,
trading volume was highest in
months yesterday as the effects of
President Roosevelt's monetary mes
sage to Congress plus recent action
of the Reconstruction Finance Cor
poration to increase the domestic
gold price brought on the greatest
wave of stock and market trading
since midsummer. Notable was the
highest trading peak of the bond
market since early 1930, the sharp
change trading.
