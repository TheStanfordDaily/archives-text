A word in contradiction of th(
current declaration that professiona
gridders have it all over the non
pros in point of interest, perfectior
of style, and precision of team work
may be in order at the present, es
pecially as there is a professiona:
football game coming off in San
Francisco this week, ;.nd some of us
"will have an opportunity to compare
the pro game with our past ama
teur, or as some would have it, semi
pro, season here in the Coast Con
ference.
Now this writer has seen only one
pro football game; but that was.
i veryone assured him, a perfectly
legitimate example of its type and
Iherefore should have been suitable
for comparison. On the basis of that
game we admit that pro football is
enjoyable, entertaining; in fact, al
together okch, but not a whit more
so than our Stanford brand that is
on view every Saturday and Sun
day p.m. of the autumn. They said
pro ball was particularly precise;
team work was smooth and so on.
Well, the first time the Green Bay
Packers shifted and set a halfback
raid the quarter into right forma
tion, while Red Grange and the full
back went into left, we promptly
stuck thumbs down on that preci
sion baloney.
And they said pro players were so
experienced, so well conditioned
that they were on a plane above
the college man. Well, the best man
on the field in that game was Angel
Brovelli, fresh then from St. Mary's.
He was the fastest, most elusive,
highest knee-actioned back we saw;
and he had more individual "color"
than the rest of the two teams put
logether, excepting Ernie Nevers,
who was playing what might be
called his farewell performance and
doing a beautiful job of it.
There was much talk of the
Packer fullback, Hinkle by name,
ballyhooed at the best passer in the
game (Benny Friedman was fading
then, and Harry Newman had yet to
strut his stuff). Well, this gentle
man delivered the first two tosses
he tried smack into the arms of
Nevers, who had hardly to step out
of his track for interception. And
so we stuck thumbs down on the
player baloney.
And they like to point out how
the pro's have made frequent scor
ing possible and how much that
speeds up the game. Baloney. You
can take any game and make a fas
ter, but essentially different one of
it simply by changing the rules. It
all reminds me of the big league
b*d: men who hot-shot the baseball
until on the least provocation it (a)
flow to hell and gone out of the park
o.' (b) bullctted right for the pitcher
until those maligned fellows got to
throwing it up there and ducking at
the same time.
And as for exciting, tight foot
ball games, the two best this critic
has ever seen were played to the
tunc of 6-0, and G-3; being, of
course, U.S.C. vs. California, 1931
tjfid 1933. Both games featured well
drilled, nigh perfect ball playing
teams, scrapping plenty, and gen
cralled by cool heads, and if the
score had been 97 to 96 or 1 to 0, no
one, we are sure, could have been
more entertained. • —Hamilton
