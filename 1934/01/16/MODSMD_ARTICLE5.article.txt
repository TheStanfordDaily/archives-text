# Endurance Record
## 
### 
Attempt at a now endurance rec
ord started yesterday in Cuba, that
is the hot-headed little nation no'w
has a new president. Youthful ex-
Secretary of Agriculture Carlos He
via is the unlucky man.
Student supporters of Dr. Grau
had stormed the palace, demanding
for 24 hours that he remain in office.
Colonel Batista, army head, who put
Grau San Martin in office last Sep
tember, is now the man behind He
via.
Cynics favor abolishing horse-rac
ing and setting up pari mutucls to
bet on the hour each Cuban presi
dent will fall.
