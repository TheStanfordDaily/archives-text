The balance of the pre-eonference

i released this coming week-end. Six
i dates in all are open for practice
games before the conference sched
ule is slated to get under way.
Seal Game
Two tentative dates have been ar
-1 ranged with the Kenealy Seals of
San Francisco but final acceptance
of the dates offered has yet to be
received. The Seals have offered
i lively competition for Card nines
I of the past, the team being made up
of major and Coast League stars.
In the meantime the varsity con
-1 tinues its daily workouts in the
i Sunken diamond. Yesterday Coach
Wolters directed a lengthy batting
j session in which individual wcak-
I nesses were ironed out.
Hamilton Good
Wolters was especially pleased
! with the work of Bob Hamilton, out
' field candidate and star on last year's
j frosh team. Hamilton, a right
handed batter, showed unusual skill
in placing hits along the right field
foul line, a difficult trick which re
! quires perfect timing.
