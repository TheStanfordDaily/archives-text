# Tomorrow Deadline For All Study-List Changes
## 
### 
Tomorrow is the last day students
may change their study lists for this
quarter without fine. Contrary to
previous announcement, the dead
line has been extended one day to
conform with the late registration
this quarter.
After tomorrow all program revi
sions must be made by petition to
the Registration Committee, subject
to the following fines: $2 for each
course added or dropped, or $3
where one course is substituted for
another.
All program changes made since
registration should be filed at the
Registrar's Office on the regular re
vised study-list cards.
