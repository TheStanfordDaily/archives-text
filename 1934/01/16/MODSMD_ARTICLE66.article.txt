## 
### 
Tree surgery is one of the im
portant duties of the University un
der the Grounds Department of the
B.A.C. The many old live oak trees
about the campus are continually
rotting out where limbs have been
cut or broken off. One of the mas
sive live oaks northwest of the Li
brary is being worked on now.
The dry rot and damp material are
first chiseled out of the decayed part
of the tree, and the cavities are then
filled up with concrete. Eventually
the bark of the tree grows over the
concrete, and the tree is as good as
ever. If the trunks of the trees are
kept painted when limbs are sawed
off, no moisture can get in, and the
trees do not rot out.
Asked the age of the huge live
oak now being worked on, the tree
surgeon replied, "Well, this one was
a pretty good sized bunch when
Columbus came over."
