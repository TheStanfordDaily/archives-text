Tentatively suggesting an un
known morning of the week after
next, A.S.S.U. Prexy Jerry Traut
man determined late last night to
ask the Ex Committee to sanction
;t dale for an all-University assem
bly to be devoted to the awarding
| of valuable gold and silver trinkets
1 to the Stanford Football Wonders of
I the past season.
Although the exact date of the
assembly is unknown and will he
announced in a future issue of the
Daily, present plans .include the
donation of gold footballs to all
lettermen of the gridiron, and the
1 presentation to Bill Corbus of a
t handsome if empty loving cup
symbolic of his election to the
j captaincy of the 1!>33 all-Ameri
can team chosen by the Christy

Walsh syndicate.
Corbus' election as their captain
by the other ten all-Americans
chosen by this illustrious group
constitutes perhaps the highest
honor available to any football
player.
It is probable that Howard Jones,
potent coach of the once potent Tro
jans, will award Corbus the cup
significant of his captaincy.
Honors Deserved
Both honors are not only bene
ficial to the football boys but also
deserved by them. Corbus' magnifi
cent outplaying of S.C.'s "Running
Rosy" Rosenberg, as well as his two
field goals, was instrumental in No
vember's momentous defeat of the
unbeatable, incomparable, invinci
ble, and Terrible Trojans.
Stanford's victory over a Bear 11
that had beaten 33 to 0 the same
Washington team that had smoth
ered Stanford in mud two weeks
earlier, was equally noteworthy and
deserving of reward—gold footballs.
