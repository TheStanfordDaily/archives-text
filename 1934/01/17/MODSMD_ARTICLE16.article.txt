# Greeks Back Pledge Prom
## Final Sanction Given Pledge Dance by Committee 
### 
With a committee of the Interfra
ternity Council drawing up final
plans, with Stanford Greeks backing
the affair wholeheartedly, and with
the Administration lending its hand
in every way possible, indications
are that Friday's "Pledge Prom"
will be the biggest and most suc
cessful campus social event in some
time.
Legal Obstacles Removed
Ex Committee action last night,
coming almost as a matter of course,
removed the last legal obstacle when
the date was granted.
The dance, which will last from
10 o'clock until breakfast served just
before 3:30 lockout time, will be
unique in many features, at least as
far as recent Stanford generations
are concerned.
Limited to Fraternities
It will mark the first time all the
fraternities have joined together in
an on-campus social function. It
will be the only campus dance in
which both the Women's Gym and
Dance Studio have been used at one
time. And it will be the only dance
held here during the quarter in
which 3:30 lockouts have been
granted.
The dance will be informal, and
will be limited to fraternity men and
their dates, due to the fact that the
dance floor cannot possibly hold
more than the 800 or 900 couples
| expected who fall under the above
classification.
