# Fuse Supply on Campus Dispels Dark 4000 Times
## 
### M. JACK NEWMAN 
Stanford is not fuse-proof, accord
ing to figures released yesterday by
1 the campus electrical department.
I Within the past year darkness has
j come as a result of blown out. fuses
I some four thousand times.
The consumption of the Univer
sity, excluding the halls, comes to
| about three thousand fuses; the halls
use some one thousand replaceable
Minks a year.
i The electrical department carries
[an emergency stock of one hundred,
of each of the smaller sizes of fuses,
land from fifty to five of the fuses
| of higher wattage. From their stock,
most arc used of the types which
fit the 125 and 250-volt plugs. The
| least are used on the high voltage

lines which carry the six and Ihe
j 23-hundred volts. There are about
six replacements a year in the for
mer and about 25 in the latter. The
2500-volt plugs are used on all pri
mary lines on the campus.
The halls use the renewable
cartridge fuses to avoid the pur
chase of a new fuse every time one
blows out. Of these links one thou-
Isand had been blown out during the
past year. Encina, home of the
frosh, used 1500 alone. Sequoia, Bran
ner, and Toyon used the other half.
Technically speaking ihc 3,000
used are divided into some 28
classes, ranging from six amperes lo
400. The ones used on the hall lines
are of the 12 and 15 ampere type.
