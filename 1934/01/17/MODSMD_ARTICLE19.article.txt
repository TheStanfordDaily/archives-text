# Seat Sale For Concert Here Moves Slowly
## Assistant Series Manager Installs Electric Signs In Concert Office 
### 
Seat sales for the John Charles j
Thomas concert tomorrow, only nor- |
j mal to date, are expected to take a
! leap ahead today, following the in
j.stallation of a huge Neon sign in j
the front window of the Concert j
Series office.
The sign, which blinks the name
"Thomas" in large red letters, is the
creation of Norman Barnes, assist
ant manager of the Series. A smal
ler advertisement, a picture of
Thomas surrounded by a red Neon
border, has been glowing in the in
ner window of the office for several
days.
Sale Disappointing
The use of the two signs, the only
ones of their kind ever employed in
j campus advertising, will be discon-
I tinued if the 25,000 volts on which
J they operate cause any interference
! to Union radios.
Prentice Messimer, Concert Series'
j manager, slated that the seat sale, so
j far, has been disappointing because
the majority of sales have been made
in the $1 section. He, also, expressed
regret that the quantity of sales, j
j though normal, has not lived up to |
! the high estimate for the Thomasj
1 r
concert.
As usual, the eminent American
baritone is expected to include in
his offering a wide range of songs
of various types and in several lan- |
j guages. His selections will be drawn j
from opera, light opera, and well- |
known popular numbers, and there j
is definite assurance that the sing- !
er's encores will be of a frankly j
popular nature.
Varied Selections
j
It is likely that he will include j
i such famous baritone selections as
1 4t Or Man River," "Home on the |
' Range," "Toreador Song," and the j
: Prologue from Leoncavallo's "I Pag- j
j giiacci."
The program for Thomas' recital,
which will begin promptly at 8:30
o'clock in the Pavilion, will be
printed Thursday.
Ushers' passes are now available
at the Concert Series' office from 9
to 4 o'clock. No usher will be ad
mitted without a pass.
