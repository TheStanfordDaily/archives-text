Ethan's basket for a few seconds
until Topping made a beautiful play
to tip in a rebound for Stanford.
Double Foul
Both teams scored a point on a
double foul. A basket from the cen
ter of the floor by Ottcii put the
Broncos into a lead which they
never relinquished. Santa Clara
scored 10 points before Stanford
counted again and their lead was
never threatened.
Topping, responsible for eight of
Stanford's 11 points in the second
half, was the only man the Broncos
were unable to stop. He captured
high point honors for the evening
with 13. Poor passing on the part
of the Indians and Santa Clara's ag
gressive defense were the biggest
factors in Stanford's downfall.
