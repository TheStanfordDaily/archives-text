# Martin Praises Art of Mexico, Labor Changes
## "Six-Year Plan" Attempted By Revolutionist Obregon 
### Will Williams 
Speaking with brisk clarity, Pro
fessor Percy A. Martin, of the Stan- '
ford History Department, told of his
observations in Mexico which he re
visited last year to a well-filled
Assembly Hall.
Explaining something of Mexico's :
involved political history, and de- j
scribing the various political par- 1
ties, he rapidly sketched the careers i
of some of the more important fig- !
ures, including Obregon and Calles. [
According to Professor Martin, the |
Revolutionary party has been in I
complete possession of the reins of j
government since 1928.
Obregon's Six-Year Plan
When Obregon took office he de- j
clared the necessity of organization. !
His suggestion took the form of a 1
"Six-Year Plan," which, unlike its)
Russian cousin, was no experiment.!
Indeed Obregon declared that "po- j
litical experiment at the suffering i
of the masses is a crime."
With the remark that Mexico was j
politically upset because its citizens '
were uninformed, were not in pos
session of enough basic, statistical j
information, adequately to govern I
themselves, Professor Martin ex
plained that Mexican administration
does not and has not ever taken the
form of a democracy.
Education Improved i
Veering from politics, Professor'
great st°ps that j
have been taken in the improvement
of Mexican transportation, the new i
highways and bus systems, the ■
elimination of the slightly ridiculous i
old railroad trunk-lines.
In education, the Mexicans have
come far. They have many good
universities, though no great ones;
libraries are to be found everywhere
in the country. In art, Diego Rivera
has come closest to the expression
of a people struggling to throw off j
the effects of the Spanish conquest i
and rediscover their own latent cul- I
tural heritage.
No "White Man's Country"
"Mexico is, if you please, not a
white man's country," declared Pro
fessor Martin. It is seeking to find j
itself. One of the chief aims of the
revolution was to give Mexico back
to her people.
"In justice to labor and the re
apportioning of arable land, once in
the possession of about 2 per cent of
the population," concluded Professor
Martin, "Mexico can be said to be
coming into her own."
