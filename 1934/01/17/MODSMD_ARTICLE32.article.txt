# THIS MAD ARMAMENT RACE

The steel mills will soon be humming again. Dividends
will begin rolling in and everybody will be happy cxeept
the people lb;il have to pay the bill, and thev are not born
vel. Obviously, they cannot complain. Everybody is happy.
We refer to the mad race in naval armaments in which
we are engaging with ourselves and anybody else that has
the money to race with us. No less than 101 new boats will
be built bv the I'nited States within a few years.
To aid in this mad building, we hear stories all the
lime of ljted Menaces, Yellow Menaces, Brown Menaces in
(ierniany, Mack Menaces in Italy. Menaces have become
the order of the day and the spectrum lias been broken up
and scattered over the international map.
The Japs are ready to sweep over China, are building
tunnels to the Hawaiian Islands, and will pounce on Rus
sia anv moment now. The Russians are planning to do
likewise, only their tunnel leads from Moscow to Yoko
hama. The tunneling fields of the other menaces have also
been blue-printed and will appear in the public prints in
the next Sunday supplements if not sooner.
All the tunnels eventually end up under the Lincoln
Memorial in Washington, D.C. Therefore, we must build
navies. And building them we are.
The theory of our navy has always been for protection
principally because we are surrounded by weak neigh
bors and have more land at present than we can profitably
use. That is also the theory of all naviesâ€”to protect.
Yet though all the nations want only protection, they
all build like mad furies. Though all the nations are strain
ing to balance budgets, they spend millions on navies.
Disarmament conferences have become old jokes. They
range from Will Rogers' summary: "They only discard the
things they don't want anyway"; to the revelation that steel
lobbyist Shearer was one of the consulting experts at a
recent conference for naval disarmament.
Roosevelt is making or at least trying to make rapid
towards national recovery. Rut recovery has outgrown the
nation. He should turn his attention to international af
fairs; and tirst of all, toward disarmament.
Complete disarmament is a dream. We don't dream
well and so are against dreams. Rut a reasonable slashing
of new building programs, at least, would be welcome.
