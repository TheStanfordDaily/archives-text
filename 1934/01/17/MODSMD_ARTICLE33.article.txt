lie fore Hie quarter gets too far along, we wish to offer
a hi I of advice to new students regarding term papers. It
conies from the heart, and is the result of hitter experience.
It appears that 111 the opinion of most professors and
their correctors, a good term papers must consist of many,
many typewritten pages. A paper typed neatly by a ste
nographer at ten cents a page will probably get a better
mark than an equally good paper poorly typed by the stu
dent. Next, the paper which is to win professorial favor
must have a bokoish if inconsequential introduction, or
better yet, both an introduction and a preface. If a fore
word is added, so much the better, even if the foreword
says nothing.
The bibliography is an important factor. Xo one be
lieves the students read or even look at more than a
few of the numerous books and documents listed as
sources, but woe to the student who tries to get away with
an honest and short bibliography. The successful term
paper must contain several pages of lies as a climax.
Touches such as lots of scholarly-looking footnotes, a
dedication, and an impressive list of chapter titles will do
wonders. An almost sure gag is to let the professor think
that you used the U.C. library, as well as the local one, to
study your subject. All this, of course, presupposes that
the professor or his corrector neglects to really read the
term papers. We suspect from observation, experience,
and inquiry that this is often the case.
We are not complaining about this system, but merely
explaining it for the benefit of the uninformed. Life is
always like this pretense and a good front count as much
as real worth. In the real world, if you have a shave and
a haircut, a good suit, a Cadillac, a nice home, and mem
bership in a good club, 110 one inquires about your soul.
