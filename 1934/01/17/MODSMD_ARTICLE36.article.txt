A second visit—after two years—
to this play and Katharine Cornell's
brilliant performance leaves one very
nearly as satisfied as the first did.
The curious construction of the play
which leaves the chief character out
of a considerable portion of its phy
sical action becomes faintly disturb
ing.
In such scenes as that between
Edward Barrett and his lisping niece
and that between the elder Barrett
and Henrietta in the third act, Eliza
beth must stand to one side, observe.
These moments, intensely important
in Elizabeth's final decision, never
theless omit her from the central
focus of the action during these long
spaces.
However, if this becomes thus ap
parent upon, a second visit, the au
ditor is able to watch the reactions
of Elizabeth more closely, letting the
other action move on with a modi
cum of attention.
By this means it is possible to
observe her agonized attention to the
scene, her reactions, and the manner
in which they build into outbursts
of emotion which may otherwise
seem a little sudden in their appear
ance.
Miss Cornell's performance in
these ordinarily unnoticed scenes is
as good as that in her chief scenes.
It. is intelligent but never cold,
studied but never apparently so. In
illustration of this: a swift-intaking
of breath as she drinks the porter,
a universal gasp as she achieves the
window at the end of the first act.
Her supporting company is com
petent and in several cases better
than that which she brought two
years ago. The Captain Surtees-
Cook modifies his artificial stiffness
with sufficient awkward embarass
ment to make him a person rather
than a caricature. The dandy and
the lisping neice are similarly acted
with less emphasis.
Charles Waldron suffers from a
stylization of approach to the role
of Edward Barrett. His inspissated
staccato loses in emotional force as
it increases in vocal force. He gives
a sincere performance, but in his
determination to make the man as
hateful as he should be, oversteps a
little into the realm of burlesque.
The heavy fatuousness of a good
many of his lines does not aid him.

Orson Welles is an excellent Oc
tavius; the role is largely one of si
lent reaction to a situation; but
without straining his character a jot
from its relatively subordinate posi

audience's attention to his state of
mind by quiet but highly delectable
facial expressions. —Sandoe

with less emphasis.
Charles Waldron suffers from a
stylization of approach to the role
of Edward Barrett. His inspissated
staccato loses in emotional force as
it increases in vocal force. He gives
a sincere performance, but in his
determination to make the man as
hateful as he should be, oversteps a
little into the realm of burlesque.
The heavy fatuousness of a good
many of his lines does not aid him.

Orson Welles is an excellent Oc
tavius; the role is largely one of si
lent reaction to a situation; but
without straining his character a jot
from its relatively subordinate posi
tion, Welles frequently draws the
audience's attention to his state of
mind by quiet but highly delectable
facial expressions. —Sandoe
A second visit—after two years—
to this play and Katharine Cornell's
brilliant performance leaves one very
nearly as satisfied as the first did.
The curious construction of the play
which leaves the chief character out
of a considerable portion of its phy
sical action becomes faintly disturb
ing.
In such scenes as that between
Edward Barrett and his lisping niece
and that between the elder Barrett
and Henrietta in the third act, Eliza
beth must stand to one side, observe.
These moments, intensely important
in Elizabeth's final decision, never
theless omit her from the central
focus of the action during these long
spaces.
However, if this becomes thus ap
parent upon, a second visit, the au
ditor is able to watch the reactions
of Elizabeth more closely, letting the
other action move on with a modi
cum of attention.
By this means it is possible to
observe her agonized attention to the
scene, her reactions, and the manner
in which they build into outbursts
of emotion which may otherwise
seem a little sudden in their appear
ance.
Miss Cornell's performance in
these ordinarily unnoticed scenes is
as good as that in her chief scenes.
It. is intelligent but never cold,
studied but never apparently so. In
illustration of this: a swift-intaking
of breath as she drinks the porter,
a universal gasp as she achieves the
window at the end of the first act.
Her supporting company is com
petent and in several cases better
than that which she brought two
years ago. The Captain Surtees-
Cook modifies his artificial stiffness
with sufficient awkward embarass
ment to make him a person rather
than a caricature. The dandy and
the lisping neice are similarly acted
with less emphasis.
