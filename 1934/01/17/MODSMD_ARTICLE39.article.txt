# CAMPUS OPINION
## NOT "GET ALONG LITTLE DOGIE" PLEASE 
### 
The Editor, Sir: I
May I cut into the territory appar
ently reserved for arguments about
the Bawl-out and riparianism ;
(whatever that may be) to say a bit •
! about John Charles Thomas.
One of the questions arising is,
i just how does Thomas rate with
j Lawrence Tibbett. Unquestionably,)
.Tibbett, through his work in the
i movies and in "Emperor Jones," has
a more popular name; but is jt safe
j to say that of all the people who
have heard both these singers in
j opera, concert, and radio, more than
: half of them feel that Thomas is the
better.
1 Thomas is a most unusual concert
, personality. In the first place, he j
always seems to feel the urge to give i

a speech during the concert at one
time or another. Then, too, he al
ways gives a program to suit every I
type of listener. He chooses his en
cores from such songs as "Old Man
River," "Home 011 the Range" (and
we can guarantee he'll sing that
one), "The Toreador Song," and
"The Prologue from Pagliacci."
Thomas is a real champion in his
field, and I hope the campus will
"take a moment off" from the wor
ries of rushing to hear him.
Sincerely,
Prentiss Messimer I
P.S.—Never let it be said that
people have to dress up to attend
these concerts. It is generally ad
mitted that you don't have to be
dressed up to enjoy a real show put
on by a real singer.
