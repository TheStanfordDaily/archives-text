# Gold, Stocks
## 
### 
Roosevelt's new gold legislation
encountered a little delay in the
House yesterday. The trouble: both
the banking and the coinage com
mittees want the honor of tinkering
with the bill. Speedy action is
promised though.
Following the gold announcement
stocks closed much higher in almost
every field, grains down a little. On
foreign market, dollar weak.
