# GREEK FLIES IRK GRAD
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I rise to point out a possible fly
i in the inkwell. Not only is it rather
| inane to continue a campus brawl
i until 3:30, but also it will mean strife
jfrom other quarters later on. The
Military Ball, (he Masque Ball, Toy
on, Branner, the Soph Cotillion, the

, Junior Prom, the fraternities, the j
sororities and Ro'ole (we hope) and ,
j maybe even Sequoia will scream for
an extension of lockouts.
In spring quarter, we just won't
get any sleep on Friday nights, that's
all. And, damn it, I have Saturday
; classes. â€”A grad
