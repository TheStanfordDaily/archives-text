The Columbia Spectator crowd
who are still lampooning football in
general r.nd the Columbia-Stanford
Rose Bowl game in particular, are
playing an off-key solo, in this
writer's opinion. After all, they
really have no profits to object to,
and the whole argument, as we have
always heard it, was to take the
profits out of football and thereby
de-emphasize it. The team won
honor of u ceitain sort, which, if not
to be glorified, is certainly not to be
sneered at; they had a heck of a
good vacation, with the opportunity
to see and hear something new.
The educational advantages of a
transcontinental (our are some
thing to work for; and if more of
the stall' of the Spectator had sim
ilar experiences, the rough edges
of their provincialism, or metro
politanism, if you must, would not
be so obvious.
We have always looked on foot
ball the same as rochefort cheese,
zipper fasteners, or Guy Lombardo's
dance band, as useful or interme
diate things, to be taken or left alone,
according to the individual's discre
tion. They are not colossal subjects,
universal importance, and may as
well be left to those people most
interested.
And events have so transpired
that not only the editors of the
Columbia Spectator have insisted
on making a vital issue of a minor
subject, but even that bumptious
sounding aggregation, the League
for Industrial Democracy, has
shoved its beagle into the fray.
What in the hell, may we ask, has
the L.I.D. got to do with collegiate
football. None, we are answered,
except that in the same category
with collegiate editors, they have
a fondness for the protruding
schnozzle, and therefore, football
like most everything else, becomes
their oyster.
If we were members of the L.1.D.,
and were paying dues to that organ
ization, and presumably members
pay dues, as we have yet to see the
organization that does not exist prin
cipally for the purpose of collecting
dues, we would squall to high
heaven if we saw the organization's
funds being dispersed on such trivi
alities as football relations between
Stanford and Columbia Universities.
We would consider that there are
problems in Industrial Democracy of
much more cogent and pressing
worth than football, and when the
kitty began checking out the shekels i,
for transcontinental telegrams, wej
would get up and go away from j
there, and when the treasurer came i
around for the next month's dues we j
would courteously inform him what
he could do with his bill.
The local head of the L.I.D.
showed half a grain of mental
acumen when he answered the
Columbia yelpers. lie said, "Foof
ball will not solve problems of
universe (ah, excellent, Dr. Wat
son) but free press will .... Fire
away with our moral support. Tell
Spectator we have no money."
Now there is an utterance of no
little genius. Keep an eye on that
lad, he should go far. And as for
freedom of the press—it is one of
the most splendid things on earth.
The only objection any wild ass may
foment trivialities into momentous
questions, given enough printers'
ink, paper stock, and front page
space. —Hamilton

We would consider that there are

The Columbia Spectator crowd
who are still lampooning football in
general r.nd the Columbia-Stanford
Rose Bowl game in particular, are
playing an off-key solo, in this
writer's opinion. After all, they
really have no profits to object to,
and the whole argument, as we have
always heard it, was to take the
profits out of football and thereby
de-emphasize it. The team won
honor of u ceitain sort, which, if not
to be glorified, is certainly not to be
sneered at; they had a heck of a
good vacation, with the opportunity
to see and hear something new.
The educational advantages of a
transcontinental (our are some
thing to work for; and if more of
the stall' of the Spectator had sim
ilar experiences, the rough edges
of their provincialism, or metro
politanism, if you must, would not
be so obvious.
We have always looked on foot
ball the same as rochefort cheese,
zipper fasteners, or Guy Lombardo's
dance band, as useful or interme
diate things, to be taken or left alone,
according to the individual's discre
tion. They are not colossal subjects,
universal importance, and may as
well be left to those people most
interested.
And events have so transpired
that not only the editors of the
Columbia Spectator have insisted
on making a vital issue of a minor
subject, but even that bumptious
sounding aggregation, the League
for Industrial Democracy, has
shoved its beagle into the fray.
What in the hell, may we ask, has
the L.I.D. got to do with collegiate
football. None, we are answered,
except that in the same category
with collegiate editors, they have
a fondness for the protruding
schnozzle, and therefore, football
like most everything else, becomes
their oyster.
If we were members of the L.1.D.,
and were paying dues to that organ
ization, and presumably members
