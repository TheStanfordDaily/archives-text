# POWERFUL BRONCO FRESHMEN DEFEAT CARDS BY 1 POINT
## 
### 
j Smashing grid basketball took the
j count over finesse play last night as
Santa Clara's yearlings sneaked over
a 29-28 decision over the Card
j Babes in one of the roughest, nip
j and-tuck games in Northern Cali
fornia this year, the referee leaving
the court after the mad fray with
the mutual jeers of both Stanford
and Santa Clara fans.
1 The Broncos were off to an early
8-1 lead when Dale Beedle took
! over the center post for the Cards.
( Then the Babes began getting the
I tip-off, made good on their free
j throws, and left the floor at half-
I time with a 15-11 lead.
Second Half Close
The second half was a hair-raiser,
j Santa Clara crept up even at the
(start and during the rest of the game
I neither team got more than a three
! point lead. McCusker of the Broncs
j proved too powerful and tricky for
I the Babe guards and made good on
(several shots under the bucket.
! By this time Archie Zamloch and
j Bill Quade had been severely handi
j capped by the bruising tactics of
their opponents, the former leaving
I the game with a badly strained leg
i and Quade trying to keep up the
! furious pace with an injured knee.
Cards Lead
With the score 28-26 the Stanford
I boys became over-anxious, fought
j back at the Broncos, and the referee
j started calling fouls. The first three
| free throws the Broncos missed.
! Kash swished a long one to even up
! the count, with one minute to go.
; Thomas made good on a free shot,
| called for overguarding, and a few
seconds later the final gun ended
| the game.
J Despite the defeat the Card frosh
I piayed their steadiest game of the
j season, with Dale Beedle showing
exceptional improvement. Beedle
not only allowed the yearlings to
grab the tip-off, with Quade crash
| ing through to tip the ball out to a
| guard, but was the only Redshirt
j who was heavy, enough to be valu
jable under the Bronco bucket.
Bronc Defense Tight
Santa Clara's tight defense made
slim pickings for the Card forwards,
the two having to be content with
Quade's one field goal. Tallying 11
during the contest, the frosh played
heads-up ball by sinking their free
throws. Dinty Moore, playing at
guard, took over the Card offense
(when the forwards were throttled,
swished two neat one-hand shots at
crucial moments, and was high point
man of the evenirrg with 11.
Kash tallied 10 to lead the Broncos
I in scoring, but it was the husky Mc
i Cusker who gave the Papooses the
j most trouble, being the bulwark of
; the Santa Clara offense from the
j center area.
