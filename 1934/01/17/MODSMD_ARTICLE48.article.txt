# FROSH TRACK SCHEDULE INCLUDES TOUGH LIST OF OPPONENTS; SAN MATEO FEARED
## 
### 
I With seven meets to try out their
| skill in competition, frosh track-
J sters this year will run up against
three of the leading junior colleges
j in the region, two crackerjack high
'school combinations, and the very
i promising California frosh, espe
| cially promising on paper.
Coach Bill Ellington fears the first
; opponent, San Mateo J.C., as the
| hardest meet of the season, as the

boys up the highway always pre
sent a formidable list of performers.
Sacramento J.C. also is usually well
up in the money, and should give
the yearlings a tough time.
The remainder of the schedule:
February 24—San Mateo J.C.
March 3—U.S.F. frosh.
March 10—A.C.A.L. All-Stars.
March 24 —Menlo J.C.
April 7—Sacramento J.C.
