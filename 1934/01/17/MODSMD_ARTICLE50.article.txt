Coach Nort Thornton is concen
trating on his water polo charges
and his 400-yard varsity relay team
this week with both squads getting
ready to open their 1934 schedules
next week.
Stanford's relay squad will enter
the Senior Pacific Association 400-
yard relay at the Olympic Club in
San Francisco Friday, January 20.
Thornton plans to use a combination
of Gordon Graves, Walt Doyle, John
Gardner, and Henry Guardman in
the race. Jimmy Triolo, ace swim
mer and water polo contestant, is
hampered by poison oak, and his
services will be lost in the San Fran
cisco event.
On the following day, the Athens
Club water poloists will meet the In
dians in the Cardinal pool.
