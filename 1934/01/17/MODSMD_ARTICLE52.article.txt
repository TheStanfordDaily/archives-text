# Sales Slow For Cal Tilt
## 
### 
Unless students rush the A.S.S.U.
office with orders for tickets to Sat
urday's California-Stanford basket
ball game today, the usually color
ful dogfight in the Encina Pavilion
will be carried on without the moral
support of the noisy, rowdy Stanford
rooting section. Though tickets have
i been on sale Monday and Tuesday
of this week, only a few have been
purchased to date. Today is the last
! day rooters' tickets will be sold.
Saturday night's game in the Pa
ivilion is the first contest of the tra
ditional Indian-Bear scries. Due to
Stanford's one-game tie with U.C.
L.A. and the Bear's one-game tie
with U.S.C., the Bears are not rated
quite the favorites they originally
'were. Stanford's underdog position
it- certain to make the game a hard
hitting fight
