# MASQUERS WILL RENEW ACTIVITY

### Mary Mayer 
The history of the Masquers is the
history of dramatic endeavor on the
campus.
Before there were any directors
on the campus, Sword and Sandals
and Masquers jointly put on plays
with the aid of the English Club.
Directors were hired.
When a regular director was fi
nally procured, the two dramatic
organizations became purely hon
orary. As plays became less fre
quent, fewer people were eligible,
and Masquers became merely nomi
nal.
Sword and Sandals, however, re
newed activity by holding readings.
Some of the faculty, including Dr.
Bailey, suggested a similar revival
of Masquers. Hence Marian Jones,
the only extant member of the or
ganization, is attempting, with the
assistance of Dr. Bailey, to organize
Masquers for women interested in
dramatics.
Women eligible for membership
must have had a major part in a
play or have taken part in two of
t lie following: a reading, a play, or
the Gaieties. Also eligible are per
sons who have worked behind sccnes
or who are clever in writing skits.
Sword and Sandals is co-operating
in this reorganization plan. Mas
quers will help them stage their
readings and will have entire charge
of the third reading this quarter.
Masquers will initiate the new
members in two weeks and will hold
another election after the first play.
