# Three Radio Stations To Handle Trojan Programs
## 
### 
A recent acquisition of KRKD on
the S.C. broadcasting schedule makes
the third station to be handled by a
student staff. KFAC and KNX
broadcast university presentations
under this staff. University pro
grams are also broadcasted over
KHJ and KFI, although not with
student supervision.
