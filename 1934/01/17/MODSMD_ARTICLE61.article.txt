# PALY COPS KNOW ALL THE ANSWERS
## 
### 
''Things we know without being
told:
1. You were not going that fast.
2. You are a careful driver.
3. The cop did not pace you.
4. The fast ones got away.
5. You favor law enforcement—
but!
WE LOVE IT."
This placard is the greeting await
ing traffic violators in the office of
rotund, sarcastic Judge Springer of
Palo Alto. It is a recent addition to
the strict enforcement drive under
way in Paly since last February.
The campus town henceforth
proudly submits to being called
''Strict, Safe Palo Alto," and claims
a record of no deaths due to traffic
accidents during 1933.
But two motorists were hurt se
riously, 19 were bruised—that's the
total list of mishaps since the safety
drive was inaugurated.
How so? "Stringent enforcement,"
answers Police Chief Zink, who said
that despite the fact that his officers
were the toughest in the state be
fore the drive, arrests since then
have become 10 times more fre
quent.
