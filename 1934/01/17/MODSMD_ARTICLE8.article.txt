Provisional President Carlos He
via, Annapolis grad, is doing his best
to organize a form of government
while the real country leaders, army
man Batista and politico Guiteras,
bite each other in the back and pre
pare for civil war. Batista and Gui
teras forced Grau to fold and pushed
Hevia into the chair. Now the two
fight and poor Hevia is in the mid
dle. Guitcra, a radical, is now fight
ing to get the army sore at Batista.
All Cuba is prepared for more war.
