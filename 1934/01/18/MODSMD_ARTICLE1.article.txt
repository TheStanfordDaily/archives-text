## CWA Marches On 
### 
Although Congress is beginning to
.sit up on its back legs and holler,
F.R. is going to send them another
"communication," (i.e., order). This
time it is about the CWA (Civil
Works Authority in the Washington
alphabet soup). To carry on until
July, another billion is needed. Well
aware that such widespread relief
makes happy voters. Congress will
probably appropriate the money.
F.R. hopes that by July his New
Deal from the bottom of the deck
will have yanked prosperity around
the corner, need for CWA relief
work will vanishâ€”maybe for good.
