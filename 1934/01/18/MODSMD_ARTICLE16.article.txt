The "Yearbook of Stanford Writ- j
ing," published annually by the j
English Club of Stanford Univer- |
sity, for which plans are now being
carried out, has had a particularly
stellar and diversified history. In
its pages have appeared the early j
work of many undergraduates who j
have since done notable work in the j
field of writing, and many who are j
still in the university but publish |
their work in national magazines.
Included in this group are such j
widely known writers as Achilles f
Holt, who has published in many |
magazuies, particularly "Hound and
Horn," the "Gyroscope," and "This
Quarter." He was editor of Volume
II of the English Club "Yearbook."
Other well known and able young j
writers are J. V. Cunningham and !
Albert Guerard, Jr., both under- j
graduates, who won the poetry and |
prose prizes of the "Hound and ]
Horn" last year. Mr. Cunningham j
has published his excellent verse in j
"Pagany," "Pottery," "New Repub
lic," "Commonweal," and many
others. He won the $25 Yearbook
Seward Memorial Prize last year.
Guerard has also published in
"Scribner's Magazine," and the re- !
cently begun "The Magazine."
Manuscripts are acceptable now
and may be dropped in the box
marked "English Club" just inside
Room 207, given to this year's editor,
James R. Broughton, or left with Dr.
Margery Bailey.
