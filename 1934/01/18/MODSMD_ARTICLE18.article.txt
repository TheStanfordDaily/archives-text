# Law Student Wins Race For Long Distance Call
## 
### 
Stanford scored more publicity
over the air when Dave Craik, law
'student, won a transcontinental tele-
J phone race in response to a request
| from a West Virginia radio station
j for a California call.
! The southern station mysteriously
j drifted in over the radio shortly be
fore midnight, the announcer iden
tifying himself as WWBA in Wheel
ing, West Virginia.
"We'll accept a reversed charge
on the first California phone call
received, and broadcast the con
servation," he said. "California
listeners, call Wheeling 38511."
Craik jumped to the phone, gave
the West 'Virginia number to the
local exchange, and awaited results.
A few seconds later the radio an-
Inounced that, a Palo Alto call had
| nosed out one from Long Beach for
t first place.
) While Craik was at the phone in

the next room, his companions lis
tened to the broadcast of the follow
ing conversation:
"This is David Craik of Stanford
University. I'm a law student and
belong to Phi Gamma Delta frater
nity. Say 'hello' to all the Fijis."
"He's saying 'hello' to all the Phi
Gamma Deltas," repeated the an
nouncer. "How's the reception?" he
added.
"Faint but clear," came the reply
from across the continent.
"What time is it out there on the
Coast?"
"Five minutes to 12."
"It's 3 o'clock here. Well, thanks
for calling, IVIr. Craik."
"llow about having the boys
sing 'California, Here 1 Come'?"
was the Stanforditc's last request.
A gang of West Virginia radio
cowboys whooped it up, and WWBA
suddenly faded out as mysteriously
as it had come,
