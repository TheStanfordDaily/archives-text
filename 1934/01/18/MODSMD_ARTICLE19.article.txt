## Denny Announces Meetings With Councils to Be Open to Students 
### 
Work on revising the Constitution
may be finished and the Constitu
tional changes ready to be voted on
by the end of this quarter, hopes
A! Denny, chairman of the Consti
tution Revision Committee.
Denny reports that the private,
preliminary work on the Constitu
tion, which the committee has been
doing since its appointment last
autumn quarter, is all finished ex
cept for some work on the by-laws.
Plan Group Parleys
A meeting with President Wilbur,
and hearings with Men's, Women's,
Publication, and Dramatic Councils
probably will be the future business
of the committee. These hearings
will not be round-table discussions
but will be for the purpose of get
ting evidence and information from
these groups.
These hearings will be open to
students. The work left to do on
the by-laws will be transacted in
private meetings, since much of the
work is detailed and the committee
will require privacy to get it all
done.
Suggestions Discussed
Tuesday night's meeting with the
Executive Committee was the Con
stitutional Committee's first meeting
with another group. Among the
suggestions discussed with the Ex
ecutive Committee were: selection
of Ex Committee members from
classes or from student body as a
whole, method of voting by prefer
ential ballot or by primary system,
one or two elections per year, and
the proposal to abolish all class of
ficers, except for those of the senior
class.
The next meeting of the Revision
Committee will be a secret one, for
work on the by-laws. It will pxob
ably be held Monday.
