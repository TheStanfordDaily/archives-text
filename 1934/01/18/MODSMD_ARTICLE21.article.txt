# Couples Dine, Dance At Sequoia-Union Dinner
## 
### 
With 50 couples attending, the
Sequoia-Union exchange dinner
dance was held last night, half din
ing at Sequoia and half at the Union.
Following the dinner, dancing was
in order in the Women's Clubhouse
where Al Rushton's Royal Cardi
nals, five-piece dance orchestra,
furnished rhythm for the roughs
and their dates.
The idea of the Sequoia "ex
change" was originated several years
ago with Roble in order that the men
and women of the respective halls
might become better acquainted.
In charge of last night's affair
were Al Rushton, Eliot Stoner,
Nancy Webster, and Miss Louise
Price, director of the Union unit.
