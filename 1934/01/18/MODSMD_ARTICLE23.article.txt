## Baritone's Songs to Range From Early Opera To Modern Pieces 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
Onto the stage of the Pavilion at
8:20 o'clock tonight will stop John
Charles Thomas, premier American
baritone, as guest artist of the cur
rent Concert Series, under whose
auspices he scored such a distinct
success in his campus engagement
| of 1932.
Equipped with a rich musical
background, a varied and interest
j ing career, and press superlatives
; from two continents, Thomas is pe-
I culiarly well-fitted to furnish the
delightful entertainment which to
night's concert promises.
Internationally Praised
The baritone made his most recent
I Coast appearance as first guest so
loist of the season at the Hollywood
Bowl last summer, when reviewers
commented that "Only a few times
| in a generation does one hear a voice

of such beautiful quality supported
by such unlimited power." Prior to
his Bowl appearance, Thomas was
heard by Brussels, London, Berlin,
Vienna, Chicago, New York, and San
Francisco.
Accompanied by Carroll Hoi lister,
who will himself present several in- j
teresting piano solos, Thomas will
tonight offer a program of wide va
riety and appeal. His selections {

teenth century founders of Italian
J i
opera, to the composers of the mod
ern English selections included in
