# NEW RULE AIDS A.W.S. OFFICIALS:
## 
### 
Lockout chairmen must deliver
all the previous week's late leave
and lockout slips to the A.W.S. mail
box in the Old Union by Wednes
day noon of the following week,
Mary Katherine Morris told repre
sentatives of the eighteen Stanford
women's living groups yesterday.
This deadline has been set in order
to assist A.W.S. officials, whose
work has been greatly complicated
by the increase in women's enroll
ment. A.W.S. Council meets regu
larly on Thursday; so compliance
with the deadline request is neces
sary if Council appointment notices
are to be mailed in time.
Regulation rules for handling the
slips were also made clear in yes
terday's conclave. Late leave slips
are to be alphabetized and ordinary
lockout slips separated from 2:30
lockouts, making three distinct pack
ages fastened together and labeled
as to living group and dates in
cluded.
In addition, Miss Yost's office re
quests that lockout chairmen add a
typewritten report of all action taken
'by living groups on lockouts and
discrepancies.
