# Young Father's Troubles Theme of 'Distant Drums'
## 
### 
Trials and tribulations of a young
father, and the gossip of (wo elderly
women, providing a unique brand
of homely humor, combine with a
true epic quality to form "Distant
Drums," which has its Stanford
debut on the evening of February 2.
The play portrays an intensely
gripping and dramatic cross-sec
tion of life among the pioneers.
lioth the grim struggle for exis
tence and (lie lighter enjoyments
of that day are faithfully pre
sented.
Dan Toteroh, himself a native Cal
ifornian, has caught the very spirit
of the westward movement, with
the result that "Distant Drums" has
a great deal of that which was found
in the epic "Covered Wagon" and
Edna Ferber's "Cimarron."
Comedy finds its expression
mainly in the characters of two gos
siping women, prying inquisitively
into the affairs of all and sundry
with insatiable curiosity. Mary Ann
Wheeler and Mary Louise Dow, both
capable and experienced thespians,

promise finished performances.
Nathan Pike, a young lad over
serious to the point of comicality, is
to be portrayed by George Cham
berlain. Much basic comedy, which
very nearly approaches poignant
pathos, emerges from this role.
For those who claim acquaintance
with the trials of a young father,
special interest will center about
the interpretation of Ronald Kay.
A highly emotional young harassed
husband, beset by the innumerable
worries of a new head of a house
hold, will never fail to provide
heartfelt mirth, as do many epi
sodes of "Distant Drums.'
"Distinctly different—runs the ga
mut of human emotion," declares
Director Harold Hclvcnston. Seven
teen characters, each an entity, with
personalities calling for cleancut
performances, will be filled by 17
experienced and capable Stanford
students; provided with the color
and human interest of "Distant
Drums," they guarantee a produc
tion of unusual merit.
