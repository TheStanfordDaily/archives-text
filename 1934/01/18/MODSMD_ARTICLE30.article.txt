### 
Alpha Delta Phi, Sigma Nu, and
Breakers Club were victorious last
night in the first games of the in
tramural basketball season, which
were marked by loose playing, poor
teamwork, and many fouls.
Sigma Chi lost to the Alphn Dolts
in the Pavilion 215 to 13, with P. Ful
ler scoring 14 points for the winners
in a colorful display of shooting.
Half time scorc was 12 to 3.
Game Postponed
The Phi Psi-Sequoia I game
.scheduled to be played in the Pa
vilion at 8 o'clock was postponed
until Saturday morning because of
the Union-Sequoia exchange dinner
last night.
Outclassed from the opening
whistle by Breakers, A.K.L. went
down fighting with 4 points scored
against 33.
Letts Stars for Breakers
Bob Letts' was the outstanding
player on the floor, both on offense
and defense. He scored 12 points,
high point man for the game. Lloyd
Phillips won the biggest hand of
the evening with a difficult shot
from under the goal.
Most evenly matched were Sigma
Nu and Delta Chi, with final score
11 to 9. No one player was respon
sible for the scores of either team,
all figuring at one time or another
in scoring plays.
Both teams played a close zone
defense making scoring difficult.
Delta Chi showed good teamwork,
not much experience. In contrast,
Sigma Nu players, apparently ex
perienced, worked poorly together.

Alpha Delta Phi, Sigma Nu, and
Breakers Club were victorious last
night in the first games of the in
tramural basketball season, which
were marked by loose playing, poor
teamwork, and many fouls.
Sigma Chi lost to the Alphn Dolts
in the Pavilion 215 to 13, with P. Ful
ler scoring 14 points for the winners
in a colorful display of shooting.
Half time scorc was 12 to 3.
Game Postponed
The Phi Psi-Sequoia I game
.scheduled to be played in the Pa
vilion at 8 o'clock was postponed
until Saturday morning because of
the Union-Sequoia exchange dinner
last night.
Outclassed from the opening
whistle by Breakers, A.K.L. went
down fighting with 4 points scored
against 33.
Letts Stars for Breakers
Bob Letts' was the outstanding
player on the floor, both on offense
and defense. He scored 12 points,
high point man for the game. Lloyd
Phillips won the biggest hand of
the evening with a difficult shot
from under the goal.
Most evenly matched were Sigma
Nu and Delta Chi, with final score
11 to 9. No one player was respon
sible for the scores of either team,
all figuring at one time or another
in scoring plays.
Both teams played a close zone
defense making scoring difficult.
Delta Chi showed good teamwork,
not much experience. In contrast,
Sigma Nu players, apparently ex
perienced, worked poorly together.

Alpha Delta Phi, Sigma Nu, and
Breakers Club were victorious last
night in the first games of the in
tramural basketball season, which
were marked by loose playing, poor
teamwork, and many fouls.
Sigma Chi lost to the Alphn Dolts
in the Pavilion 215 to 13, with P. Ful
ler scoring 14 points for the winners
in a colorful display of shooting.
Half time scorc was 12 to 3.
Game Postponed
The Phi Psi-Sequoia I game
.scheduled to be played in the Pa
vilion at 8 o'clock was postponed
until Saturday morning because of
the Union-Sequoia exchange dinner
last night.
Outclassed from the opening
whistle by Breakers, A.K.L. went
down fighting with 4 points scored
against 33.
Letts Stars for Breakers
Bob Letts' was the outstanding
player on the floor, both on offense
and defense. He scored 12 points,
high point man for the game. Lloyd
Phillips won the biggest hand of
the evening with a difficult shot
from under the goal.
Most evenly matched were Sigma
Nu and Delta Chi, with final score
11 to 9. No one player was respon
sible for the scores of either team,
all figuring at one time or another
in scoring plays.
Both teams played a close zone
defense making scoring difficult.
Delta Chi showed good teamwork,
not much experience. In contrast,
Sigma Nu players, apparently ex
perienced, worked poorly together.
