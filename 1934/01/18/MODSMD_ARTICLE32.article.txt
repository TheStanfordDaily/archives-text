# RED ROSES AND HOT ROCKS
## 
### 
Thai all clments of the Administration and of student
government co-operated to make possible (he "Pledge
Prom" is not only of historical moment but of great satis
faction to all or practically all.
The President suggested the idea. Ihe Deans' Offices
approved it. The Comptroller's Office secured I lie Dance
Studio. The Women's Council granted the late leaves. And
(he Executive Committee approved the date. 1 his solid
{'ton I made possible the solving of the problem that was
lacing the InterfraterUity Council.
All is a bed of roses. All is a bed of roses without
thorns, lint beneath the velvet red petals lie some hot
rocks rocks whose acute heat will not be felt for some
lime.
Some would prefer to let buried rocks lie buried; but
the danger to human feet should some stumble on the hot
rocks in Eden-like innocence demands a labeling ol the
hidden heat.
First hot rock: For years the Dance Studio, over which
Dr. Dyincnt has reigned supreme, litis been limited to for
mal dances. That precedent is now broken. Ihe "Pledge
Prom" is an informal dance. What is goose for the fra
ternities should be duck soup for anyone else. I hat most
beautiful locale for campus affairs, the Dance Studio, is
now available for till who can meet the financial burden.
Second hot rock: All campus dances, with the excep
tion of the Senior Ball, have been officially terminated by
I : 30 late leaves. The "Pledge Prony ups the limit by two
hours. If women can ruin their health, scholastic stand
ing, or propriety on this night, they should be allowed to
ruin these virtues on other nights.
To the answer that the fraternity problem is different
in that there hail been illegal parties in the city for some
years, we point to other illegal parties. If illegality is to
be made sole grounds for granting new rights, a wave of
< riminality is due to break out any minute now. Aside
fiom its lurid past, constitutionally speaking, the frater
nilv situation is no different from any other situation.
We are looking forward to these new 3: liO dances; not
because we want to go, for we don't, being afflicted with
eight o'clock Saturday classes. We will just be interested
in the effects, if any, on campus social life. Our interest is
purely sociological.
The fraternities have given us 3: 30 dances in the Dance
Studio They are to be thanked. They will no doubt aid
in the "Hack to the Farm" movement. Whoopee!
