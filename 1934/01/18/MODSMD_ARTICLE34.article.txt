# Roosevelt Is a Nice Man

### 
Franklin Roosevelt is a nice man. We like him per-1
sonallv and admire his ability, hut this idea of holding
birthday parlies for him in .">,OOO American towns, cities,
and villages is distinctly annoying.
II probably annoys Roosevelt more than anyone else;
bill he can't do anything about it. Neither can we. Rut we
can express disapproval and that is more than he can do.
The chief obstacle to recovery via Roosevelt is the
dread, expressed and silent, that Roosevelt is becoming
dictator; or among some, that he is a dictator. This group,
which will increase as the President jumps on more toes, |
also fears such words as socialism and bolshevism. 'I hey
attack some of the hands in the New Deal, not on principle
Iml on imaginative nomenclature.
This feeling will grow as the semblance of opposition
lades. Roosevelt, to be fully effective, must have an oppo
sition. And the surest way for opposition to fade entirely
i lo begin deifying the man. The move to make his birth- ;
day a national holiday has faded, or at least lapsed for j
the present. Rut these gargantuan birthday celebrations j
are almost as bad.
After all, it's pretty hard lo attack Roosevcll for birth-j
control on pigs with millions screaming for bam and eggs,
n(!er eating cake at his birthday party.
