# BULL SESSION
## COP AND ROBBER 
### 
The institution of robbery is as
hoary as it is disgusting, the earliest
petty theft (and to some the most 1
disgusting! being the stealing of one -
floating rib to make one curious
woman. Like the poor, thieves are
always with us. But Insull, Bess
meyer, and others have proved that!
there is no casual connection.
As a topic for philosophic discus
sion or newspaper headlines, rob
bery can be a matter of considerable I
enjoyment. But when Stanford stu
dents continue to "dish it out," .and i
someone else does all the "taking" I
—philosophy takes a back seat; i
money talks and screams for pro- )
I
tection.

To a number of students on the j
Farm —the thing is no longer even '
mildly amusing. There is nothing j
like a good, healthy robbery to kill i
a sense of humor. Whether the ;
thieves have made entries through |
doors, over doors, under doors, or
around doors—a situation exists ■
which must and can be cured.
It is too much to expect that Stan
ford's police force can adequately i
patrol a 9,000-acre campus—even j
though both men are strong, healthy,
and as far as we know—good Amer- |
ican citizens. It is also too naive to j
believe that when valuables lie un- :
protected, the more industrious and
less custom-bound members of the
community will refrain from "seek- |
ing and finding." The reasons for j
robberies, however, do not prevent
robberies.
Being neither criminologist nor
cop, we hesitated to even suggest a
possible solution. But the anguished
cries of our suffering comrades has
overcome our natural temerity. We
burst forth with a two-point pro
gram for crime-prevention.
(1) It is well known to readers of
the Ever-ready (adv.) battery dis
plays in the Saturday Evening Post
! (adv.), that "Crime loves dark
ness." Though we can probably not
control this "love," we can control
| the "darkness." Let us banish dark
i ness in those sectors subject to pil
| lage. On the bleak wastes near
Branner and Toyon; in the environs
|of Encina, Sequoia, and other dan
! ger zones—a very few light stand
\ ards would send sneak-thieves scur
rying back to their dens of iniquity.
Further, if room lights were left
| burning during the deadly hour of
j 6-7, the hazard would be materially
reduced. At present, Officer Gordy |
Davis may cruise right past the halls
while shorts, garters, and overcoats
are rapidly changing ownership.
(2) Since police tell us that nearly
all the robberies occur during that
one hour, why not hire a few Stan
ford behemoths to serve as senti
nels along the firing line during the
J supper period? Football men would
j probably not object to picking up an
j additional 50 cents per day.

Unfortunately, this plan does not
carry a money-back, guarantee. But
neither does the present system—
and it is far more expensive.
