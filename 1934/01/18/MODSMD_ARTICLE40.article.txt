## ROMEO AND JULIET At the Columbia Theatre 
### 
Katharine Cornell's interpretation I
of Juliet is too rich, and wcil- '
rounded to bo easily described by
the usual critical adjectives. Her,
acting is not the usual one-sided
presentation that it is so easy to
classify. Instead, she realizes Ihe
part to the utmost, developing every
possibility as far as is compatible
with consistent characterization.
Her Juliet was more mature than
Shakespeare had planned her, but
Miss Cornell's judgment in playing 1
the part in this way cannot be ques- I
tioned. Her rich voice gave amazing ;
depth to almost every line, and :;he
alone of the cast v/as perfectly able j
to reconcile both the lyrical and the
dramatic quality of the play. Her
changes of ir.ood were so subtle that
they never interfered with the unity
of impression; she realized the hu
mor of the play without ever losing
the emotional quality underlying it.
Basil Rathbone's Romeo was sur
prisingly good, but only in the
j scenes with Friar Lawrence was he
completely at ease. His Romeo was
not "intellectualized," but much of
the emotional quality seemed too
studied and just a bit rigid, espe
cially in the earlier scenes. His em
phasis on the dramatic parts of the
play caused him to lose much of the
poetry. And in some scenes there
was a tendency to exaggerate.
The Mercutio of Orson Welles was
interesting and .skilfully done. But
he tried to make Mercutio the hard
ened cynic throughout, even in the
Queen Mab speech. That he almost
succeeded is a tribute to his acting
ability if not to his judgment. His
part especially suffered from inju-
I dicious cutting.
| Katharine Cornell's productions
have one advantage over most star
plays in that the supporting cast is
usually excellent. This one is no ex
ception; even the most minor char
, acters knew what they were t doing,
read verse well, and instilled life
• into the numerous dull speeches.
Charles Waldron as Friar Lawrence,
Alice John as the Nurse, and Rey
nolds Evans as Escalus might be
singled out for special mention.
Guthrie McClintic's direction was
weak in several respects. Aside from
several technical blunders, he can
be criticized by failing to develop
the pictorial quality which the play
might well have. In some placej

(notably in Mercutio's death scene)
he did not seem to grasp perfectly
the significance of a scene. He was
further hampered by a script which
was not cut as judiciously as it
might have been.
