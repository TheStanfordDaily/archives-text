# BEN LEADS LARGE ELIGIBLE FIELD IN TIME TRIAL LAPS
## 
### 
Showing apparently complete re
cuperation from the injuries that
blighted his showing to some extent
last year, Ben Eastman, the blazing
"Bangs" of 1922 and at present a
graduate student in the Business
School, led more eligible if less
capable Stanford track men in yes
terday's series of time trials. East
man strode through a 440 in the
fast January time of 49.4, thus prov
ing that the old legs are again as
good as new.
Coach Dink Templeton, hale and
hearty on the judge's stand, raced
his distance and middle distance
men through quarter-miles, most of
the boys proving to better at their
customary races. Fastest 440 of the
day was recorded by Chuck Voight,
a freshman sprinter who toured the
old Angell Field track in 53 sec
onds in his first attempt at the
quarter-mile.
Ninuno Records 2:08
The three men who constitute In
dian strength in the distances all
worked out, Chuck Nimmo record
ing 2:08 in a practice 880 and Art
Azevedo making an unmentionable
time in the quarter. Ollie Amdahl,
third of the t;io and one of the
Coast's ace two-milers until handi
capped by injuries, took his prac
tice early and did no work for time.
S:anford'.s hurdling trio and Stan
ford's frosh hurdle sensation ran
time trials in the highs, with Sopho
more Klopstock recording the fast
est time when he hit the finish line
in 15.4.
Sprinters Miss Even Time
Captain Gus Meier, who at the
finish of the 1C33 season was right
on top of the heap of United States'
hurdles, ran 15.6, apparently again
faced with his old bugaboo of a
dragging left leg. Hunt Kingsbury's
time was not announced, but Ernie
Evans, afore-mentioned frosh sen
sation, was clocked in 15.8.
The sprints found Carlton Thorns,
Card hope to replace Les Hables,
running his century in 10.1 and A1
Blaekman recording 10.2. Black
man, both a sprinter and quarter
mi ler of note, may be used in the
100, the 220, the 440, the relay, or
all of them this year.
Lyman Out Temporarily
Johnny Lyman has not been out
this week because of a sprained an
kle: outstanding weight perform
ances were therefore not forthcom
ing yesterday. Johnny Mottram,
with a 207-foot javelin toss to his
credit already this quarter, also did
not appear yesterday.
Eastman fans, incidentally, will be
interested in the 1933 captain's fin
ish of his 440. After running easily
around the turn, he finished in per
fect. form, head forward, knees up,
and waiting for no man.
