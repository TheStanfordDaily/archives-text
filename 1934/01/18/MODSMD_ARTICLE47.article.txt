## A 						HITCH OR TWO AMONG THE RUGGERS 
### 
Rugby football is a king among
sports, and in the near future a
great many people feci that it is
destined for a much higher ranking
in California than it now obtains.
All the colleges are flocking to it
enthusiastically; British Columbia is
sending a "Rep," or all-star team
down in March, Harvard is think
ing about a California tour; Califor
nians are thinking about a Japanese
or an Australian tour. But there are
a few difficulties which must be
ironed out before the sport will com
mand a l'eal hearty following among
the younger generation to whom it is
something strange and foreign.
First of all, if we are to be rugger
fans and watch games, \vc must
develop some appreciation of the
rules of the game, and this goes
for players as well. There is a cer
tain way to play rugby, the rules
have been designed to further that
end, and to protect the players
from injury.
Rugby referees are generally old
players who know the tricks and
who are not working for money, but
for the pleasure of being in some
way connected with the sport. In
our experience, they are absolutely
impartial. Indeed, the very spirit of
rugby breeds no desire of extending
oneself to questionable tactics in
order to win, and the foul smelling
messes which have been turned up
at football and track in this vicinity
during the past few years, are ab
solutely foreign to rugger. So no one
argues with the officials. It simply
isn't done.
