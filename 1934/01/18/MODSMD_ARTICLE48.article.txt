# THEY HOWLED AT THE WHISTLES
## 
### 
The referee at last week's San
Jose-Stanford game was the recipi
ent of considerable derision because,
most spectators held, he slowed the
game down, with frequent whistlings.
Well, after all, they do have rules in
rugby, mad as the game may look
to the uninitiaed, and if a referee
doesn't call at least some of them
the contest deteriorates into most
anything but rugby.

I Last week's referee realized that
he was dealing with newcomers to
the game, one set of them bein.ij
particularly green, and he made
no attempt to call half what he
might if inclined to be stringent,
j Properly played, rugby is clean
i and interesting, and no apologies for
an unpalatable match are necessary.
I The Stanford and California men
who made the British Columbia trip
learned some of the niceties of play,
! but the information helps not a bit
' against strong and powerful men
whose idea is to get in and mix it up.
I That's fun for the players, it's true,
but not for the on-lookers.
