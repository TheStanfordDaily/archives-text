# Good Cleaners' Fun
## 
### 
In S.F. racket-ridden cleaners and
dyers were having lot of labor trou
bles yesterday, a thousand union
workers out on strike; more were
threatening to join. Pickets were
tearing around in cars, drumming
up business.
Workers' gripe: NRA has brought
them worse conditions, longer hours,
layoffs. Owners' complaint: NRA's
higher prices have spoiled business,
increased competition, already pret
ty cut-throatish.
Last night,* bearded old George
Creel, NRA mediator, stepped in,
threatened to use big stick, can the
local union, if they refused to go
back to work while arbitration pro
ceeded. They went.
