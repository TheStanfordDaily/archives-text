# FROSH CAGERS 10 BATTLE U.C. WITH IMPROVED PASSING
## 
### Mort D'Evelyn 
Slightly bruised after ihe grueling
and disappointing Bronco defeat,
Stanford's yearling basketball team
spent last night's practice session
filling the gap caused by the loss of
Archie Zamloch, first-string guard,
and polishing up on their passing
offense for their four big games with
the Cal cubs. The first is set for
Saturday night as a preliminary to
the varsity clash.
Zamloch. in the hospital with a
fractured ankle bone, gained the
reputation during the past practice
games of being one of the scrappiest
and most spectacular players of the
frosh squad. His hard-hitting game
will be missed during his three
weeks of recuperation.
Scholt Moved Up
Coach Rabbit Bradshaw, who took
over the reins again after a short
trip to the Midwest, has temporarily
moved husky Carl Schott up from
the third string to fill Zamloch's
shoes.
Larry Randall and Howard Erl
enheim are two other experienced
guards who may be moved into the
vacant post. Randall handles the
ball as well as any one on the squad,
and Erlenheim is solidly built,
makes up in fight what he lacks in
height, and plays the type of game
that a guard must in order to keep
on even terms with a U.C. five.
Quade at Forward *
Bill Quade, slightly misused Tues
day night, is holding down his for
ward post again, with Turner and
Moore playing their regular posi
tions.
Dale Beedle, who showed a vastly
improved game against the Broncos,
has won the first call for the center
job and probably will start against
Cal.
