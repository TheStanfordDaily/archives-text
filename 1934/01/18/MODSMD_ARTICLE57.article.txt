# COACH ANNOUNCES LAWSON LITTLE AS TOP RANK GOLFER
## 
### 
Lawson Little, Walktr Gup team
| member and veteran golfer, has been
I seeded number one on the Stanford ,
club-swinging squad for the coming
season of competition, announced
Coach Eddie Twiggs iast evening.
An infected hand forced Little,
! who was also ranked first last year,
;to abandon his planned attempt to
| establish his place without being
| seeded. The same infection forced
| him from competition in the recent
National Match Play open tourna- |
jnient in San Francisco.
Little's position is the only one on )
i the varsity ladder to be announced
thus far. However, a complete team
lineup will have been arranged by
! Friday night. It is necessary that
; all team members who wish to be ,
ranked qualify by tomorrow.
Scores to date of qualifying rounds
have been unexpectedly high.
Twiggs attributes the lack of low
' scores to the constant fog and mois
ture that have made the greens
soggy and the fairways muddy on
the Stanford course.
The appointment of Little to first- j
ranked star leaves a large field to
strive for the second position. Tom
Dwyer apparently has a slight edge
! because of his remarkable showing ;
iin the San Francisco Open. Don
Edwards and Jack Hoerner furnish ,
Dwyer's most potent threats. Ed- i
| wards was second man last year and
! Hoerner, although apparently slight
] ly off his game at present, is almost
'unbeatable when in top form.
Transfers Spec Stewart and Irving
1 Sloto should be high up on the lad

last try for the team and may suc
