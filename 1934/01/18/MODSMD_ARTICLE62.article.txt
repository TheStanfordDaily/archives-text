# Student Launches Jug For Ocean Current Data
## 
### 
A gallon jug may â€¢ help Marion
Ford get her diploma at Golden
Gate Junior College.
Her graduation thesis will be on
the Japanese current. To obtain
data she prevailed upon a trans
pacific ship captain to throw the jug
overboard when he reaches 30 de
grees north of 140 degrees west en
route to Honolulu.

A note within it, in English, Chi
nese, Japanese, and Polynesian, asks
the finder to report date and posi
tion of the jug upon recovery.
She will then know facts about
the current which she needs to know
for her graduation paper, a year
and a half hence.
Men get the breaks at Detroit
University. Its enrollment this year
consisted of 77 men and 3,543 women.
