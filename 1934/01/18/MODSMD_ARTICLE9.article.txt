# CARD CAGEMEN DRILL OFFENSE FOR U.C. GAME
## Topping, Mallatratt, Edelen Seem Certain Starters In Saturday Tilt HOPE TO UPSET BEARS Right Forward Position Is Hotly Contested 
### Charles Chappell 
Intent on bringing Stanford's bas
ketball team up to the point re
quired for any quintet that , has
hopes of upsetting the powerful
California squad, Coach John Bunn
drilled his charges last night in the
intricacies of a fast-breaking, point
scoring offense, something that will
be sorely needed against the Bears
Saturday night.
Just who will perform on the first
team in the initial contest with the
cohorts of the Blue and Gold is still
pretty much of a moot question.
Topping Sure to Play
Keith Topping, high-scoring, vet
eran forward, is undoubtedly a fix
ture on the first-string, while Gordy
Mallatratt seems to have earned
himself a regular berth at guard
with his smooth play against U.C.
L.A. and Santa Clara.
Captain Hal Edelen, though never
spectacular, will probably hold on
to the center job through his con
sistently steady performances. Char
lie Rogers held down the other
guard position in practice last night
though A1 Page and Jack Cosgrove,
both recently recovered from inju
ries, may move in opposite Malla
tratt at any time.
Forward Prospects
Still open, however, is the right
forward spot which may be occu
pied by any one of four men. Gorter,
Shreve, Cowing, and Anderson all
paired off with Topping against San
ta Clara, with apparently little ad
vantage for any one of the four.
Cowing, high-point man in the sec
ond U.C.L.A. game, looks to be
about the best of the group, al
though his lack of height would
probably be a serious handicap
against California.
Arnic Anderson, if he regains the
pace he set in earlier practice games,
may see a good deal of action Sat
urday night.
U.C. Trio Powerful
Whether Stanford's forward trio
can match California's Captain Hal
Eifei-t, Greg Engelhard, and Dave
Meek is a question around which
the battle will probably rage when
the Indians and Bears tangle. Ei
fert, Englehard, and Meek were re
sponsible for 74 points in Califor
nia's series with the two Utah teams.
