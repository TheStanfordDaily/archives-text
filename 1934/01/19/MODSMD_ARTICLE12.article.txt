# Following Coast Success U.S.C. Takes Up Rugby
## 
### 
Rugby, already an important part
of athletics in the north, is now on
its way toward becoming a recog
nized intercollegiate sport at U.S.C.
Coach "Tiny" Peterson has been
drilling the rugger men in funda
mentals and expects to have a game
between his first and second teams
tomorrow.
Progress has been such that
Coach Peterson predicts that his
men will be ready for games with
northern teams within a month. A
northern tour with a Stanford game
as a certainty and a possible op
ponent in either California or San
Jose State may be arranged.
