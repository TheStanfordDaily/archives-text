activities to presage the Class of

ation from Stanford, dance chair
man Dick Gould announced last
night that the date of the senior
jolly-up lias been definitely set for

Senior leaders, including Class
President Bill Morse, are instituting
a number of social get-togethers to
furnish seniors the opportunity of
renewing friendships and class spirit
formulated four years ago in En
cina and Roble. Thursday's dance
will be held in the Women's Club
house from 7 to 8 o'clock.
All seniors of either sex and all
women of any connection escorted
by senior men will be eligible for
entrance to the Clubhouse, the pro
vision concerning outside women
having been found necessary to
supply sufficient dancing partners
for the men of '34 because of the
dearth of women of '34.
Manifold debate resulted in the
selection of Bob Clancy's 5-piece
orchestra to furnish the music.
