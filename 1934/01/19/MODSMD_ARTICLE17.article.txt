# WOMEN'S 3:30 LOCKOUTS ARE SPECIAL GRANT
## Concession Tonight Sets No Precedent for Future Dances—Millard 
### Frances Ayres 
Stanford women had better gather
three-thirty late leaves while they j
may—it looks as if tonight's con
cession to the "800's" night life will
be the last.
Allowing the Pledge From to
extend two hours longer than the
usual campus dance is a special j
concession on the part of the ad
ministration, and the late - leave
granted to Greek - dating coeds ;
was not given with the idea that
it would be repeated for other
functions.
This is the attitude expressed yes
terday while managers of future
dances such as the Military Ball in
dicated that they would be inter
ested in obtaining 3:30 lock-outs il
it were possible.
Prom Unusual
The granting of the leaves for the
Prom was done with the intention
of allaying fraternity tears shed
over the prohibition of the usual
pledge night party given in San
Francisco, and to promote interest
in a campus dance.
"The Women's Council," said
A. W. S. President Jeanne Millard,
"did not give this permission with
the idea of setting a precedent, but
because the Interfraternity Council
made their decision at the last min
ute and the dance needed a special
impetus to insure its success."
Lockouts Serious
The theory of late leaves, she ex
plained, is to allow Stanford women
to go somewhere until 1 o'clock.
The time from then to their lock
out hour is spent m transportation.
Thus the three-thirty privilege to
night gives the coeds two more
hours of dancing than they have
ever had before except at the Senior
Ball.
"Since an abuse of this privilege
would be considered serious," she
added, "I would advise all the wo
men to leave the dance before its
final closing, as the probable traffic
jam might delay their return."
Rules Unchanged
Miss Anastasia Doyle, Roble di
rector, also indicated that the 3:30
leaves would not set a precedent
and that they were granted only for
a very special situation.
Further indication that fraternity
met are getting their Prom as a con
solation gift from the administration
came from Dr. Bertha Dyment's of
fice, where it was said that the dance
studio will not ordinarily be opened
for any dance but a formal.
New Tradition
"The unusual circumstances of
the Pledge Prom, which include the
administration's interest in it and
the large crowd that is expected, are
responsible for the Interfraternity
Council's obtaining the dance stu
dio," was the word received.
Donn Tatum, chairman of the
Greek Council, was unable to say
whether or not the Prom would be
come the traditional way of cele
brating pledge night. He indicated
that its future would depend upon
the success of tonight's dance, but
admitted that the former city part
would probably never meet with
administration approval.
Other Requests
That the 3:30 leave for the Prom
has put never - before - conceived
ideas into the heads of campus
dance chairmen was evidenced. Al
ready the Encina manager has re
quested that the freshman dance
be allowed to extend after 1 o'clock.
Nat Kendall, chairman of the
Military Ball, said, "I'd like to get
permission to have the dance last
longer if it is possible." Stan Beau
baire, chairman of the Rally Com
mittee, which puts on the annual
spring quarter Masque Ball indi
cated that plans for the lateness of
the Ball would depend upon fu
ture developments, stating that he
believed 1 o'clock is late enough for
the affair.
