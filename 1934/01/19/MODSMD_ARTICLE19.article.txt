Gym, all will be found in readiness '
for what promises to be the biggest, .
precedent - setting Interfraternity I
Dance the campus has seen.
All the superlatives have been
made possible by the work of a !
committee of the Interfraternity
Council, who have i,n the short;
space of four days made all arrange
ments for tonight's affair. Chair- ;
maned by Dave Packard, the com- j
mittee includes John Bacon, Bill
Stark, Duncan Mcßryde, and Jack
! Freeman.
Two Orchestras
Two orchestras will supply music
1 from 10 to 3 o'clock. A1 Rushton's <
Royal Cardinals will be found in |
the gymnasium side of the build
| ing, while Bob Clancy's Band, for
' merly under the direction of Gor
i don Heche, will play in the Dance
; Studio.
I Both of the halls will be draped
and artistically decorated, with par
| ticular attention paid to the sound
| effects. To make sure that everyone
I of the 800 or 900 couples expected
j can hear the music, special broad
j casting units will be installed in
| each hall.
Breakfast Served
j When the dance is at its height, at I
about 1:30 or 2 o'clock, breakfast
will be served, planned to satisfy
[ even those with the most bear-like
appetites. "In order that things may
run smoothly," announced Packard,
'colored cards will be issued to each
couple. The color will indicate at
which serving the couple can ob
tain their food. The order will be 1
announced at the dance."
Also to avoid confusion the com
mittee has asked that cars be parked
on the far side of the women's gym,
where a large area across from the
tennis courts and the swimming
pool has been set aside for addi
i tional parking space. This will en
able cars to leave the dance with
little confusion and will help in
getting the girls home in time for
3:30 lockouts.
Admission by Card
Admission to the dance will be
by card only. These will be passed
I out to each house this afternoon.
Each house president must ascer
tain the number of cards needed be
j fore the committee brings them.

| last night had accepted the invita
| tion offered them included Dean
j Mary Yost, Mr. and Mrs. Bill Elling
j ton, Mr. and Mrs. Harlow Rothert,
! and Mr. and Mrs. Phillip H. Taylor,
j Inasmuch as tonight's affair rep
resents a new form of pledge cele
bration, and that the administra-
I tion has granted many concessions
[ in order to make the dance a suc
| cess, Interfraternity head Donn Ta-
I turn last night made the following
j statement:
"We arc looking forward to a
most successful party, despite the
j short time of five days given over
to planning for it. The whole
i hearted co-operation that has been
; shown by the fraternities in sup
porting this plan would seem to in
dicate their readiness to aid in any
movement having as its purpose the
bringing back of all social activities
to (he campus.
"Too much credit cannot be given
J to (he committee responsible for or- j
; ganizing the Prom. The University
authorities have been very kind, i
not only in their enthusiastic ap
proval of and willingness to grant
i special concessions to the plans of
; the Interfraternity Council but in
] the great help given by them in
j working the plans out to comple
i tion."
