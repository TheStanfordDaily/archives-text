## 
### MARY MAYER 
Winter quarter Bawl-outs went
on sale this week. The directory
shows a net gain of 192 students on
the Farm, while Cal reports a loss
of approximately 400. Grades range
from a low of 0 -54 to a high of
i 15+30.
Looking into the book, it seems
there are few Chits left; most Par
sons Parker round or Waite and
Walker round. Everyone looks Skin
ner and more Work than before. The
whole Collonge looks pretty Sauer
j this Tinim. The Rhodes are full of
i Stones and Bugges. Oh, Dear, these
| Gross Wales. '.
Isn't This Cute?
The Howe is Fowler than the
| Halls. The Frates haven't even the
I Price of a Copp of Teague. Nobody
is Flippen anymore, all Sadler and
some even sort of Snively. Nutting
Moore about that.
While some .students profess to

being Reich, there are others who
csrry on for the King, the Pope, and
the Prince —in addition to the Kai
ser. Mercy! This place is Fuller
rivals!
The Chase continues Daily! Ladds
Parker in Lanes at Knight at Cor
nell and make an! attempt Atkisson.
But she is Real Wise and gets Mad
den a March Hare —the same Auld
Storey.
Bacon on the Beach
In addition there are lots of Ba
con, several Barnes, Beach, a John
Alden, and a Mark Anthony. A
Barr defies the Palo Alto Liquor
Law. A Barron represents the No
ble. A Green Peache is either Sweet
Orr Pleasant. Shoor!
'Tis Knight, the Flockes on the
Hill are Scapey. This is all a bunch
of Yoakum.
The Bawl-out is on sale at the
' Registration Office for U5 cents.
