# INDIANS EAGER FOR WIN OVER BERKELEY FIVE
## Last Win Over California Basketball Team Was Scored in 1931 CALIFORNIA FAVORED Card Win Over St. Mary's Good Indication 
### Charles Chappell 
Having had one jinx broken at
their expense when the Santa Clara
Br ones slipped one over last Tues
day for the first time in several
years, the Stanford cagers will be
all set tomorrow night to break a
jinx themselves, this time at the ex
pense of California Bears.
Not since 1931 have the Indians
beaten the Bears on the basketball
court and no such unpleasant sit
uation is expected to endure in
definitely. Three years ago Stan
ford defeated the Blue and Gold
• cagers 37 to 32 at the Oakland
Auditorium and since then the
balance has been all in favor of
the Berkeley quintet.
Though few people would prob
ably cafe to wager much money
against the big, powerful California
team, neither would many be in
clined to look on Stanford's chances
as utterly hopeless. Judging by
comparative scores in the twin se
ries that the two teams played
against the Utah universities, Cali
fornia has a decisive advantage. The
Bears defeated Utah State 49 to 31
and the University of Utah 43 to
32, while Stanford bowed to the two
teams 46 to 35, and 48 to 24.
Win Over Moraga
On.the other hand, California won
from St. Mary's by little more of a
margin than did Stanford. The
scores of the Bear-Gael games were
35 to 30 and 34 to 27, while Stan
ford's margin ovef the Moragans
was 34 to 32. Greater familiarity
with the Stanford Pavilion is ex
pected to aid the Indians somewhat.
Though Coach Bunn had not defi
nitely decided upon his starting
lineup yesterday only one position
seems to be at all doubtful. That
is the righl forward post which has
been occupied at various times by
Ainie Anderson, Wetz Gorier, Emil
Cowing, and Bill Shreve, a quartet
of junior transfers, three of whom
are in their first year at Stanford.
Anderson in Form
Gorter has been in a slump lately
while Anderson has recently re
gained (lie form he showed in early
games and will very likely get the
cal! Saturday night. An accurate
shooter, Anderson at his best will
probably cause the Bears a good
deal of trouble. Cowing, though
handicapped somewhat by lack of
height, will probably see consider
able action.
Topping and Captain Hal Edelen
at left forward and center, respec
tively, both veterans, arc fixtures at
|their positions. Edelen's defensive
jwoik makes him particularly valu
able. Gordy Mallalratt and Charlie
j Ro:;ers will start at guards. Though
i not very tall, Mallatratt goes high
in the air after the ball and hi>
husky build fits him for roughing it
'up with the best of them.
California's starting lineup will
probably consist of Captain Hal
Eifcrt and Greg Engelhard at for
wards: Dave Meek at center; and
Steve McCJ«ffey and Milt Stan
sky at guards. All live of these
boys arc adept at playing a crash
ing brand of basketball and will
probably give the Indians a stren
uous evening of it.
The conference setup linds fill
four teams tied for first place Ihis
week-end with tonight's and to
morrow's games having a decisive
bearing on the final result. If South
ern California can upet the U.C.L.A.
Bruins twice, they will be off to a
commanding lead in the race.
