### 
The rising wave of cynicism has robbed us of many of
llic lilllc gods llial we trsed io worship. It was much fun
lo worship; and an ugly taste resulted when Hie gods crum
bled and became dusl dusl (licit stuck in the throat and
made one spit vigorously.
Hut though the intellectual house-cleaninghas gone on
unabated for these many years, on a nice while pedestal in
a line marble room, stands David Starr Jordan. Me is tall
and strong and his hair is white.
Doctor Jordan "was Stanford's lirsl president. lie was
Ihe spiritual father of the University even as the Senator
was its material father. Each gave bis all toward the crea
tion of this school. Stanford poured forth his millions, but
only bv the faith and strength of Jordan did they take
form. Stanford built the Quad but Jordan breathed life
into the dead walls.
It was he who gathered the professors, who placed his
mark on the students, and who sel the University in the
proper direction. It was his idealism that guided all.
It was he who lirst selected the motto: "The Wind of
Freedom Is Mowing." It was that spirit that marked the
birth of the University and its growth from that time. It
is that spirit that students should feel and nurture as their
own. If ever that perishes, then Jordan will be dead.
Now he is alive.
Doctor Jordan was a man of courage. Me felt it a man's
duly to select high ideals and follow them. He never wa
vered from his concept of right and his concept of right
was high. He felt that was a student's life. His students
believed him. If ever they stop, then Jordan will be dead.
Now he is alive.
lie would have been years old today. But three years
ago he went to sleep. Me was tired, but he was peaceful.
