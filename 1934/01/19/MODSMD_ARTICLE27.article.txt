Ever since Aesop was illustrated, his pert truths have
circulated like hot water in a small kettle. The story about
the fox who couldn't reach the grapes is of phenomenal
popularity. So popular that every criticism is immediately
packaged and labeled "sour grapes."
Thus, should the Daily criticize a bigger navy, it is
simply because our feel aren't big enough to get in the
navy. Should we criticize Rolph, it is simply because we
can't milk cows with the left hand and lay cornerstones
with the right.
When it came to sororities, we felt absolutely free. Be
ing from birth, sentenced to pants and stiff evening shirts,
no one could ever say that our fun with sororities was
prompted by uuripened grapes. After all, bjology is biology.
Hut some people whose ears overlap in the back of
their narrow minds feel that our comment on fraternities
is prompted by the now famous grapes. That must be.
Let it be.
It must be slated that the reason fewer are peeved with
fraternities than sororities is thai so many male Greeks
treat the matter sensibly. They may hire a hotel room to
keep live pledges in safe cold storage till pledge morning
but aside from a little playfulness like this, they never gel
excited. Of course, there are dim perennial sophomores on
the How that gel excited; but their own brothers laugh at
them so that lakes care of the situation.
lin I the freshmen sometimes are cxciled excited be
cause of the mystery of il all. Personally, we don't care
if you do or you don't. Hut the important thing, frosh, is
not to let anyone make you think you are on the brink of
anything thai will make or unmake you.
There are at least 7)7 varieties of things that are more
important than joining or not joining a fraternity. Tell
(hat to them when you gel a bit sweaty in the "hot box."
