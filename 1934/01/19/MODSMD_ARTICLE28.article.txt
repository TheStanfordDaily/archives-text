# Gravel for Grovelers

### 
The Administration wo have already thanked for grav
eling the pathway to the rear of the Library for the benefit
of hall residents in the southern part of the campus.
Once again we appeal to the powers that be on behalf
of those who must tread the mud-bound route from the
Knglish corner to the Hoard of Athletic Control building
or the men's gymnasium. Why we overlooked this in the
first place is beyond us (but perhaps not you, dear reader),
for that walk should win honors for being the slipperiest
place on the Farm in wet weather.
Not only does it have those famous chuekholes. It even
goes into the unusual, just like our weather, by gathering
water across from the B.A.C. in such large quantities that
a mudhen once mistook it for its long lost home.
While our tight on behalf of the gravel trust is an open
admission of our afliliations with that august group, we
nevertheless must tight on, on behalf of the student body,
etc., that Stanford may become a liner and cleaner place
where fond parents may send their little ones.
