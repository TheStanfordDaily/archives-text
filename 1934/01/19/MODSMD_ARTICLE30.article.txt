THE CRITICAL CLICHE: lII—
Vocabulary
Another method of evasive eu
phemism employed by many critics
is that of using words which have
become meaningless either through
consistent misuse or insistent over
use.
Words and phrases are In them
selves insufficient wilhout some in
dication not only of their meaning
but of the basis for their use. And
criticism which poses as such while
labelling a play "'sophisticated" or a
personality "exotic" without ex
plaining those haokneyed words by
showing the reason for their selec
tion, is a lamentable —if almost uni
versally encountered—failure.
One frequently meets such words
as "colorful," "charming," "naive,"
"glamorous," "daring," "adequate,"
'"n i c e," "brilliant," "intelligent,''
"outstanding." But seldom has ihe
critics sought to follow up such
terms (particularly insofar as the
frequency of their appearance makes
all of them equally blank) with any
apology for them.
There are several customary but
shallow defenses for such misty and
inconclusive terminology. There is,
for instance, seldom sufficient space
at the critic's disposal to treat a play
and all the members of a worthy
cast justly. But this merely argues

I for a greater concentration of at
tention. Too, it is frequently neces
; sary to write newspaper comment
j with considerable dispatch. But this
! simply argues for a change of pol-
J icy which will permit sufficient time
for calmer deliberation.
But all too frequently such words
! as I have mentioned act merely as
,an ill-fitting mask of incompetence
1 inasmuch as they are at once the
j stock of any dullard hack and them
selves ludicrously interchangeable
i without further complication of the
j alleged critique.
The intelligent critic will seek to
avoid as far as possible the cant of
j the press-agent whose only achieve-
I ment has been the sterilization of a
| great stock of adjectives, or, at least,
j will endeavor to support and define
those which he must use.
