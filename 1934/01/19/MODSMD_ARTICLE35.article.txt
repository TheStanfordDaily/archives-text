## WHAT OF THE L.I.D., FATHER?

The Editor, Sir:
Apart from the fact that the L.I.D.
; does appear and sound ridiculous, i*
I strikes the laymen among such
things as being a somewhat unnec
essary emphasis laid upon the gro
tesque aspects of the L.l.D.'s posi

out purely for the sake of objecting
to something. It strikes the lay
man among such things as ostenta

Not being possessed of a particu

freely prints his activities and

Perhaps he would prefer to keep
his subversive activity subterra

publicity might blight the growth
of sympathy for the pitiful Mj\

under the impression that Mr.
Beichman is a martyr to the cause
of free press, am given to wonder
at Mr. Evans' objection to the use
of free press for the defense of free
press.
But then, of course, Mr. Evans
paid for the telegram himself.
Doubless he found it gave him a
glow of the sort not to be derived
from the writing of sports comment.
