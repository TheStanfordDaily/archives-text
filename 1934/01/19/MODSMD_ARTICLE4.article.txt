### 
.Following a conference between
F.R. and Postmaster General Far
ley, Washington predicted radical
changes in party office holders. F.R.
has frowned upon the practice of
having national committeemen prac
tice law.
Result so far: Robert Jackson, sec
retary and committeeman from New

urer, have resigned. Expectancy:
No lÂ»ig party man in law practice if
administration can help it.
