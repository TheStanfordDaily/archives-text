# DR. E. G. MEARS DESCRIBES PLANS FOR COURSES, RECREATION IN SUMMER QUARTER
## 
### 
Courses in art and music are to
be offered for the lirst time in Stan
ford's summer quarter curriculum,
according to the director, Dr. Elliot
â€¢ G. Mears, who returned to the cam
! pus this week after an extended
j eastern trip.
A rare treat awaits music lovers
who are at the University this sum
mer in the concert series of Bee
thoven Quartets by the famous Pro
1 Arte Quartet of Belgium, a gift of
I Mrs. Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge, of
Boston, to the summer quarter.
Renews Acquaintances
While Dr. Mears was in the East,
he renewed acquaintances with sev
eral former members of Stanford's
summer faculties. He also met two
1 of the men who are to be here this
J summer, Professor W. L. Crum of
| Harvard, who is head of the Har
vard Economic Service, and Dr. R.
D. McKenzie, head of the Depart
ment of Sociology at the University
of Minnesota, a man internationa'ly
known for his work in the Insti
tute of Pacific Relations.
"I have the impression,' Dr.
Mears says, "that our attendance

' this summer will be certainly larger
than was the case last year because
of the widespread demand by stu
dents for serious study than cha
tauquas for the expenditure of their
time and money.
"Education ii the real sense was
never so much at a premium, and,
of course, at Stanford our opportu
nities are unique, due to the attrac
tive course of study offered for full
University credit."
He's Been Around
Professor Mears attended the ses
sions of the American Economic
Association in Philadelphia and
later spend a week in Washington
where he talked with many of his j
former associates fn government
service as well as with some of the
newcomers in the present adminis- j
tration. The main topic of conver
sation among college men in the 1
Erst was the Rose Bowl game.
While Dr. Mears records his pcr
-1 sonal disappointment over the score,
he .says that he is convinced that
Stanford's prestige rose greatly, be
cause of the fairness and good
sportsmanship displayed.
