# New Method of Practice Debating Proves Success
## 
### 
A new method of practice debat
ing was tried at the meeting of the
Stanford debaters yesterday after
noon, which proved quite success
ful. The question discussed was:
"Resolved, that the powers of the
President should be substantially
increased as a settled policy," of
which, in speeches of five minutes
each, Herschel Champlin and Jo
seph Fessio upheld the affirmative
end Henry Lowenstein and David
MellinkofC the negative.
After this, instead of the usual
rebuttal and decision, those present
who desired to speak took the plat
form, presenting additional argu
ments, refuting points adduced, or
otherwise strengthening the case of
either side. The experiment ap
parently proved to be successful,
for nearly everyone had a chance
to speak.

handball tournaments are favored.
