# Blue Eagle Plume
## 
### 
Fan dancers waved at the blue
eagle today. Right behind them were
clowns, shills, wheelmen, freaksâ€”in
fact the whole carnival industry is
pleading for a code before the Little
Egypts put on their first ostrich
feathers this .spring.
Long-time burlesquers, honky
tonkers, or what have you, are now
full-fledged fan-wavers, and ask for
codified salaries and fan sizes, which
two items are directly related.
