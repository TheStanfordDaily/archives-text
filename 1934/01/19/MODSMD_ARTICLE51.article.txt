# Babe Basketball Five Play U. C. Yearlings Tomorrow
## FAVOR CARDS FOR FIRST FROSH HOOP BATTLE WITH CAL Game Expected to Develop Into Rough Contest If Gridders Play 
### Mort d'Evelyn 
In what will probably result in
a struggle of grid tactics to over
come finesse play, the roughness
proportional to the efficiency of the
referee's vision, actual or feigned,
Stanford's smooth Frosh basketball
five will meet the Husky California
Frosh in the preliminary to tomor
row night's varsity game, at 6:30
p.m.
Callaghan Star
Filled out with beef from the
football eleven, the Blue and Gold
yearlings boast a quintet which will
make up in aggressiveness what
they lack in smoothness and team
work. Hefty Jud Callaghan slipped
out of a tackle job on the football
field into the center post on the
floor ,and his height will force the
Red guards to cover up the hole
under the bucket that has marred
their edfensive play during the past
week.
Ed Sparks has done most of the
scoring for the Cal five, while Bob
Herwig, the other forward, has
come up fast during the past two
weeks and may give the Indians
trouble. In last Tuesday's game
with the S.F.U. Frosh, Lou Eaton,
another football man, stood out
with steady defensive play at guard.
Club Not at Peak
Cal's short practice season, how
ever has not allowed the Cubs to
be in top form for tomorrow night.
With five wins and two defeats be
hind, Coach Bill Higgins' Berkeley
five will not be set to display their
grapevine or weaving passing of
fense with the same smoothness that
will characterize their play later in
the season. Their most impressive
play this year was a 35-24 win over
Sacramento High, a strong come
back after a decisive defeat at the
hands of Lowell High of San Fran
cisco, which the Card Babes licked
the following night.
If Rabbit Bradshaw's men can
meet the rough tactics that Cal
teams always display with some ag
gressiveness of their own, they
should walk off the floor when the
final gun sounds with the ball game
in the bag.
Boodle at Center
With Dale Bcedle controlling the
tip-off, as he should, the Caid for
wards will have to bust through in
grid style to tap the ball to the
guards if they expect to stay in the
game. The yearlings depend on two
fancy shooting forwards to ring the
bucket with the winning tallies, but
as the Galileo game showed, they
must get the tip-off to make any
kind of a showing.
Carl Schott apparently has won
the post vacation by the crippling
ol Zamloch, but Bradshaw has
a capable and reliant guard in How
ard Erlenheim who should get in
the game if the going gets rough,
for this San Francisco boy has
showed that he can hold up his own
under the backboard with the big
gest of opponents. Laßue Smith,
who has played with the reserves
all season, finally got his chance
this week and showed a strong de
fensive game; his additional height
may be useful tomorrow night.
The starting lineups: Stanford
Frosh — Turner and Quade, for
wards; Beedle or Williamson, cen
ter; Moore and Schott, guards. Cali
fornia Frosh—Sparks and Young or
Herwig, forwards; Callaghan, cen
ter; Eaton and Greenwood or
Knight, guards.

must get the tip-off to make any
kind of a showing.
Carl Schott apparently has won
the post vacation by the crippling
ol Zamloch, but Bradshaw has
a capable and reliant guard in How
ard Erlenheim who should get in
the game if the going gets rough,
for this San Francisco boy has
showed that he can hold up his own
under the backboard with the big
gest of opponents. Laßue Smith,
who has played with the reserves
all season, finally got his chance
this week and showed a strong de
fensive game; his additional height
may be useful tomorrow night.
The starting lineups: Stanford
Frosh — Turner and Quade, for
wards; Beedle or Williamson, cen
ter; Moore and Schott, guards. Cali
fornia Frosh—Sparks and Young or
Herwig, forwards; Callaghan, cen
ter; Eaton and Greenwood or
Knight, guards.
In what will probably result in
a struggle of grid tactics to over
come finesse play, the roughness
proportional to the efficiency of the
referee's vision, actual or feigned,
Stanford's smooth Frosh basketball
five will meet the Husky California
Frosh in the preliminary to tomor
row night's varsity game, at 6:30
p.m.
Callaghan Star
Filled out with beef from the
football eleven, the Blue and Gold
yearlings boast a quintet which will
make up in aggressiveness what
they lack in smoothness and team
work. Hefty Jud Callaghan slipped
out of a tackle job on the football
field into the center post on the
floor ,and his height will force the
Red guards to cover up the hole
under the bucket that has marred
their edfensive play during the past
week.
Ed Sparks has done most of the
scoring for the Cal five, while Bob
Herwig, the other forward, has
come up fast during the past two
weeks and may give the Indians
trouble. In last Tuesday's game
with the S.F.U. Frosh, Lou Eaton,
another football man, stood out
with steady defensive play at guard.
Club Not at Peak
Cal's short practice season, how
ever has not allowed the Cubs to
be in top form for tomorrow night.
With five wins and two defeats be
hind, Coach Bill Higgins' Berkeley
five will not be set to display their
grapevine or weaving passing of
fense with the same smoothness that
will characterize their play later in
the season. Their most impressive
play this year was a 35-24 win over
Sacramento High, a strong come
back after a decisive defeat at the
hands of Lowell High of San Fran
cisco, which the Card Babes licked
the following night.
If Rabbit Bradshaw's men can
meet the rough tactics that Cal
teams always display with some ag
gressiveness of their own, they
should walk off the floor when the
final gun sounds with the ball game
in the bag.
Boodle at Center
With Dale Bcedle controlling the
tip-off, as he should, the Caid for
wards will have to bust through in
grid style to tap the ball to the
guards if they expect to stay in the
game. The yearlings depend on two
fancy shooting forwards to ring the
bucket with the winning tallies, but
as the Galileo game showed, they
must get the tip-off to make any
kind of a showing.
