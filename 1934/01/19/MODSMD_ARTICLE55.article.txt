## 
### DOROTHY SWEET 
A little more than two* years
have elapsed smce the death of
David Starr Jordan, Stanford's first
president and the one man more
than any other responsible for the
building up of the University. To
day those who knew him personally
and even those who are acquainted
with him only as a great man will
pause to pay tribute to him be
cause it is the anniversary of his
birth.
From 1891 until his death in 1931
Dr. Jordan was an integral part of
the University, as president until
1913 when he became chancellor.
The last few years of his life he was
an invalid, but he never lost his
intimate connection with life on
the campus. During his lifetime it
was the custom of the students and
faculty to pay their respects to Dr.
Jordan on his birthday.
Long Experience
His connection with university
and college life started in March,
18G9, when he entered Cornell Uni
versity as a freshman. In three
years he completed four years of
undergraduate work and two years
of graduate. From Cornell Dr. Jor
dan went to Indiana Medical Col
lege and from there to Butler Uni
versity, returning then to instruct
in botany at his alma mater.
He was professor of natural his

| Tory at Lombard University, and
then professor of biology at Butler
j University, where he had studied.
The next step in his career was to
become the youngest college presi
endt in the United States at Indiana
, University.
When Senator Stanford conceived
the idea of founding a university in
memory of his son, he sought a
president who was young enough
to grow up with the University
and yet a man already showing
outstanding ability. David Starr
i Jordan was the man.
Steady Leader
Dr. Jordan saw the University
through the lean years at the be
| ginning and then brought it safely
through the crisis of the 190G earth
quake. Besides being the builder of
a great University, he was one of
the foremost leaders toward world
; peace and in 1924 his peace plan
won a first prize of $25,000 offered
; by Raphael Herman. He was dec
orated for his peace work by the
Emperor of Japan.
Herbert Hoover epitomized the
work of Dr. Jordan, when he said
at his death: "Dr. Jordan's death
will be felt by many thousands of
students who came to him in fifty
years of active leadership. Few in
his calling have won such universal
I affection."

have elapsed smce the death of
David Starr Jordan, Stanford's first

the idea of founding a university in
