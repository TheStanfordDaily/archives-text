| game this season, have been in ac
| tion and will play tomorrow. John
ny Reisner, Ray Lewis, and all the
i rest of the back field aces are on

! by a tie with San Jose, they must
complete the remainder of the sea
!son with no defeats and beat the
Olympic Club, present league lead
! ers, to win the Northern California
'Flugby Union title.
