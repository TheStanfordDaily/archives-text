## [illegible]IAN FIVE DISPUTES [illegible]GNOSTICATIONS

"â– lis commentator, for one, was
va.'jcly amazed at the improvement
milie by the varsity basketball team
within a short space of ten days.
The outfit that we once publicly
prophesied (with reservations)
would not win a conference game,
actyally won their very first, at
tempt, and had the second in the
bagi but forgot to draw the string
and' lost the critter.
Then came back to their home
court and gave what should have
been a better team a scorching ses
sion. Except for a few minutes after
half time when the Broncos seem
ingly could not miss the basket, and
were dumping in all manner of
shots, the Indians stayed right with
their opponents.
Stanford had plenty of shots but
tould just not make the ball go
true; Coach Eunn reports his men
sunk only 15 per cent of their at
tempted shots, which is no respec
table average at all.
At any rate the Cardinals are
looking up, and we are sure they
will not be the pushover for Cali
fornia's great team that they once
looked. It promises to be a decent
game in the Pavilion here tomor
rom night.
