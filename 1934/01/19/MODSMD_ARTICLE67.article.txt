# RUGBY GAME ON TAP TOMORROW
## 
### 
And as for rugby, those peculiar
cusses ought to put on a better show
tomorrow in Seal's Stadium than
was the case here last week. The
S.F. Blues had a reputation of being
second only to the Olympic Club
among the club teams, despite the
fact that the Stanford seconds
knocked them over 3-0, two weeks
ago.
Anyway, they sound like old
hands at the game, if one is to judge
by the accent of the players. And
we believe this Stanford team will
show any rugby side a sporting af
ternoon, notwithstanding their dis
mal showing against the San Jose
maulers who had their own version
of the game, and stuck to it.
