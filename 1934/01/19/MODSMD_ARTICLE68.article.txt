# TRACK BUG'S SEASON NOW OPEN
## 
### 
It feels mighty good to be able to
stroll out to Angel? Field and lounge
around in the sun of an afternoon,
now. The inimitable Dink Temple
ton's stentorian voice has lost none
of its qualities; Eddie Haman, the
walking sports encyclopedia, is on
deck, and there are always some
excellent prospects blooming over
the horizon. •
At present the hurdles situation
looks very comfortable, with Cap
tain Gus Meier, Sam Klopstock, and
Hunt Kingsbury. Then there is a
big limbed freshman, Evans, repu
ted to be new at the art of clipping
the sticks, who looks as if he may
be guod, too, one o' these days.
