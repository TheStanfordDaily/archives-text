### Barbara Sweet 
Thrilling the audience by his mel
lowness of tone and resonance of
voice, John Charles Thomas last
night equaled his Stanford success
of two years ago in what promises
to be one of the outstanding per
formances of the season.
Singing before a capacity house,
Thomas' varied and popular pro
gram was greeted with enthusiasm
by the appreciative crowd that filled
the Pavilion. His rendition of Schu
bert's "Erlkonig," and the subse
quent encore, the Prologue from "I
Paggliacci," a request, were high
spots of the evening.
Impromptu Speech
True to form, Thomas introduced
the second part of his program with
an impromptu speech. It is his habit
to thus informally acquaint his au
dience with the story of one of his
songs in the French group.
"I am very fond of the next song,
myself," he said, in preference to
Pessard's "Requiem du Coeur," "for
two reasons. In the first place it is
a very agreeable song, and secondly
because it gives me a chance to
make a speech."
"Trouble," a song by Robert Mac-
Gimsey, which Mr. Thomas sang in
his concluding group, was first in
troduced when Mr. Thomas gave it
in one of his Town Hall concerts in
New York last fall. The composer
was in the aq.dierj.qe at the time..
William Lindsay's "Limited Service "
is also a new song this season.
Many Encores
Not to disappoint his eager au
dience:, Thomas responded to their
thunderous applause with an almost
unheard of number of encores, only
ceasing after he had sung seven se
lections. In this group were in
cluded favorites as "Annie Laurie"
and the promised" Home on the
Range."
Carroll Hoi lister proved an excel
lent pianist as well as a competent
accompanist. His three solo selec
tions .were well received by the
j audience, whose applause elicited an
encore. His rendition of De√üussey's
"Clair de Lune" was especially no
table.
After completing his Berkeley and
San Francisco engagements, Mr.
Thomas will leave immediately for
New York, where he will make his
debut with the Metropolitan Opera
Company in Verdi's "La Travrata."
The performance, scheduled for
February 2, is being-sponsored by
Vassal - College.
Financially the Thomas concert
was a success, the scat sale net
ting $425. more than any previous
concert of the season.
