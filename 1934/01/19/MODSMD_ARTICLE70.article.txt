# TENNIS SCHEDULE FOR 1934 SEASON NEAR COMPLETION
## 
### Julius Jacobs 
Long delayed, the schedule for
Stanford's net team in 1934, was an
nounced yesterday.
As in former years, the Cardinal
netmen will travel south during the
end quarter vacation, between
March 30 and Apirl 3.
Card Netmen from L.A.
Owing to the fact that most of
the Stanford netmen hail from the
Los Angeles region, most of them
are playing on familiar ground,
when they meet teams from U.S.C.
and U.C.L.A.
In fact, many of the squad played
prep school tennis, in many cases
paired with present college players
from the two southern schools. Only
two or three players not from south
ern California, will make the trip.
The remainder will be home for,
Easter vacations.
U.C. Match March 1
The complete schedule calls for a
first series tennis match against
California on March 1. This initial
match will be played at Berkeley,
whose courts are inferior to the
Cardinal varsity courts.
Following this, on March 30, Stan
ford meets its first tough opponent
in U.S.C., and one day later, U.C.
L.A., also at Los Angeles.
U.S.C. Match
On April 7, the Trojans will make
the trip north, meeting Stanford on
the campus, while the next week
end, April 14, the Uclans return the
southern visit in an attempt to win
the title
Following these matches, the final
collegiate contest of the season will
be held again on the Farm, when
California plays its last match
against Stanford, April 14.
Practice Matchcs
Prior, however, to all these
matches for the coast conference
crown, the Card netmen will en
gage in an extensive series of home
and home practice matches, all for
the purpose of working up a smooth
singles and doubles squad.
First will be the California Ten
nis Club of San Francisco, to be
played on January 27, in San
Francisco. IJere will be met prob
ably the hardest tennis compe
tition of the year, with Gerry
Stratford, Phil Neer, Sherman
Lockwood, and other outstanding
California netmen meeting the
varsity.
Providing that Captain Chuck Otis
regains the use of an injured ankle,
there is a possibility of winning
this match.
