## 
### Will Williams 
The second issue of "Stanford
Criteria" magazine, supplement of
the Daily, which is to appear on
February 1, will present a wide
variety of stories, articles, and
poems. Confronted with the prob
lem <.f selecting from the large
quantity of poems submitted this
quarter, as well as stories, sketches
and criticism, the editors are kept
busy; but (hey declare that this
number ol' "Criteria" will reach
higher standards than the I'l'st is
sue.
Quality High
Although regretting that the end
of the current volume of the Stan
fold Daiiy near the end of the quar
ter Las necessitated an early dead
line and a concentration of edi
torial effort, there v/xll be no letdown
in quality, and the editors have ex
pressed pleasure at the large amount
of excellent non-fiction and poetry
which has been contributed. Short
prose fiction will, however, be min
imized for the present, though by
no means neglected.
Although no official announce
ment of material accepted has yet
been made, it is tentatively revealed
that one of the articles will be a
discussion of recent tendencies in
the economic interpretation of his
tory.
Many Sourccs
It has been repeatedly empha
sized by the editors of "Stanford
Criteria" that, unlike the "Year
book of Stanford Writing" manu
scripts from all sources wiil be in
cluded, the sole "criteria" being
that of merit. It will be remem
bered that Professor Anderson's
commentary on Irving Babbitt was
one of the features of the first issue.
And A. Grove Day's history of the
Stanford Little Magazines also lent
great interest. As a result of this
width of field from which to select,
plans are now maturing for the pub
lication in the present issue of two
short articles by writers of national
prominence. But the bulk of the
material will be student-written,
with a scattering of alumni and fac
ulty writers.
As previously announced, there
will be included work by the editor

of the "Yearbook of Stanford Writ
ing" for 1934, James R. Broughton,
who has contributed articles on Ra
vel and the recently issued collected
prose of Elinor Wylie.
Basketball was invented only 49
years ago.

proval of Stanford's Keith Top
ping: "This Topping was the
smoothest player on the court in
the Westwood-Palo Alto series. The
big center is always cool. He's fast
and aggressive and is forever sink
ing unexpected shots.
