Repeated waving of handker
chiefs, sneezing, sniffling, and
coughing in classes, has shown that
the usual mid - winter season of
, colds has descended upon the cam
i pus. A few cases of influenza have
been reported, and students have
been sent to the hospital by the
doctors.
An interview with Dr. A. Storey,
general director of the School of
Hygiene and Physical Education, re
veals the efforts the health services

, spread of diseases over the campus.

In regard to the sniffles attendant
I with colds, Dr. Storey urges all
| students to report to the health
ices as soon as they feel signs of
contracting any illness, for co-oper
ation is necessary to stamp out epi
! demies. He points out that not a
great deal can be uone with colds
i in advanced stages, though wilhin
' a short time the health services will
experiment with method of control
tried by Dr. Harold Diehl at the
health center of the University of
Minnesota with very good results.
The health services receive week
ly reports from the State Depart
ment of Health, the U.S. Public
Health Service, and from several
outstanding state and municipal
health departments, in order to get
the earliest possible news of ap
proaching epidemics and to find out
what to look for.
' Isolatiqp of cases with communi

! cable disease is one of the best
methods of control of epidemics,
according to Dr. Storey. Ha says:
j "If a student with a communicable
, disease is found, he is immediately
isolated in the Palo Alto Hospital
under modern scientific control."
"Dr. C. E. Shepard of the Men
i Students' Health Service is contin
ually on the lookout for cases of
communicable disease that might
arise among men of the University.
The same careful alertness is shown
by Dr. Bertha Dyment of the health
service for women."
