# INFLATION EFFECT IS SLIGHT SO FAR, COMMENTS HALEY

### Charlotte Burridge 
Generalization about inflation is
difficult because of (he different
senses in which the word may be
used, but, regardless of which of
the three current definitions is em
ployed, the effect of inflation has
been thus far very slight, according
to B. F. Haley, Associate Professor
of Economics.
Professor Haley explained that in
using the term "inflation" some per
sons mean simply the issue by the
government of a large quantity of
unredeemable paper currency, while
others mean an increase in quan
tity of currency and credit. A third
group interpret the word as an in
crease of the general level of prices.

The direct effect upon the individ
ual of a rise in prices depends en
tirely on his source of income, he
stressed.
"Those whose incomes come from
fixed salaries and interest are, in
part, adversely affected. The wage
earner's income does not rise as fast
as prices, but he will have more
employment and in the end will be
better off," Professor Haley ex
plained.
Business profits are likely to in
crease more rapidly even than
price. Therefore the employer is
likely to be still more favorably af
fected.
"As to the prospects of inflation,"
the economist said, "revaluation of
the dollar with a smaller gold con
tent may increase the quantity (in
terms of the dollar) of gold in bank
reserves which would make possi
ble an increase of bank deposits
through bank loans, but this is nol
necessarily so."

"Bank reserves have been ample ;
for such expansion previously, but
such expansion has been slow to
take place. Prices will not auto
matically rise, but only as there
takes place an expansion of bank
loans and credit," Professor Haley (
stated.
The ending of uncertainty with
regard to what is going to be done j
by the administration with the dol
lar, may have the effect of increas
ing business confidence and allaying
distrust, he believes.
