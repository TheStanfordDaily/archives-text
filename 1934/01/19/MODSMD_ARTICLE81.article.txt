# NRA Under Fire
## 
### 
U.S. Senate bigwigs trained then
oratorical guns on the NRA yester
day. Blasts ranged all the way from
friendly demands for changes to out
right charges of dictatorship. Chief
blaster was Idaho's perennial insui
gent Borah. His complaint: NRA has
strengthened hand of trusts and
combines, who are llcecing the con
sumer. He will plump squarely for
bigger and better anti-trust laws
unless something i.s done.
Professional snooper Nye from
windy North Dakota also hov/led
about monopoly, threatened another
"investigation." Indiana's Republi
can Robinson, professional bonus
seekers' friend, was positive he ,saw
the shadow of the Stalin or Musso
lini bogeyman lurking behind the
Blue Eagle.
Virginia's peppery little Carter
Glass fired away, said the little fel
low was being forced to the wall by
scowling General Johnson's NRA.
What was more, the crusty officer
was glad of it. The Senator thought
something out to be done, went to
see F.R.
