# Pledge Prom Wins Praise
## Phi Delts Lead as Record Class Is Pledged 
### 
Friday night's "Pledge Prom"
celebration, voied successful in
every aspect by all in attendance,
marked the pledging of 267 by 24
fraternities on the campus, by far
the largest number ever to "go
Row." Last year's total was 196.
As cannons ceased firing, bells
and drums quieted, and the smoke
of battle cleared away, Phi Delta
Theta emerged at the head of the
list, with a pledge class of 20
freshmen and transfers. Sigma
Alpha Epsilon followed closely
with 19, while the majority of the
others drew from 12 to 15.
Wild excitement,, perhaps not
quite the same as that of sorority
pledging 10 days ago, held sway on
the Row until well into the evening,
when the scene of celebration
shifted to the Women's Gym for
the prom.
The dance, which found 1,600 or
more people dancing to the music
of A1 Rushton's Royal Cardinals and
Bob Clancy's band until 3 o'clock,
was praised by everyone present as
being the most completely success
ful affair to be staged on the cam
pus in some time.
Deans Mary Yost and George Cul
ver yesterday added their compli
ments to those already heaped on
the committee who arranged the
dance, on the celebrators and their
conduct, and on the prom as a
whole.
The entire list of pledges, printed
in Friday night's Daily extra, has
been reprinted in this issue and
will be found on page two.
