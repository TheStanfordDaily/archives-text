I sole charge of seeing that some 1,700
dancers at the Pledge Prom were
i fed enough breakfast to keep up
their stamina until 3:30 o'clock in
the morning.

"I worked four days steady on it,"
he said.
His helpers were 13 experienced
fraternity cooks, who volunteered
their services. The tremendous
amount of food was cooked in the
Union kitchen in huge utensils such
as yard-wide frying pans and five
gallon coffee pots.
"We kept only two men scram
bling eggs, but it took many more
than that to break them," said Free
man.

with the breakfast was kept on the
campus. The raw materials were

Mention scrambled eggs and sau
jsage to Jack Freeman and he will
probably groan. The Sigma Nu In
i terfraternity Council member had
I sole charge of seeing that some 1,700
dancers at the Pledge Prom were
i fed enough breakfast to keep up
their stamina until 3:30 o'clock in
the morning.
| Freeman, waxing mathematical,
; figures that 3,240 egg.s were scram
! bied, 3,200 sausages fried, 1,700 rolls
baked, and 24 pounds of coffee
j boiled for (he hungry mob which
i breakfasted very early Saturday
'morning in the Women's Gym.
Union Kitchen Used
"I worked four days steady on it,"
he said.
His helpers were 13 experienced
fraternity cooks, who volunteered
their services. The tremendous
amount of food was cooked in the
Union kitchen in huge utensils such
as yard-wide frying pans and five
gallon coffee pots.
"We kept only two men scram
bling eggs, but it took many more
than that to break them," said Free
man.
Miss Christine Kicker, director of j

! campus dining halls and experienced
in feeding students en masse, was an
j invaluable help to Freeman. With
jout the co-operation of the Union,
he indicated it would have been
necessary to hire a caterer. As it
! was, all of the business connected
with the breakfast was kept on the
campus. The raw materials were
bought from the Co-op.
Truck Delivers Food
j Cooking the food in sufficient
i quantities was only one of Free
man's problems. The Union kitchen
is a long way from the Women's
Gym, and a plate of scrambled eggs
ana sausage is not the handiest
thing to carry aiound in the cold
night air.
A fast, efficient corporation yard
truck equipped with a driver who
fully realized the importance of his
task made the dash between pro
ducer and consumer. The food, hot
( fT the stove, was rushed in mam
moth containers to two serving sta
t'ons in the Gym where electric
plates kept it hot.
" Any food left?" "No," says
Fieeman, who suspects that many
Greeks and their dates had firsts,
seconds, and even thirds.
