# FARM STRIKE JUSTIFIED BY INVESTIGATION
## National Committee States That Cotton Agitators Were Abused 
### 
Aftermath of California's agricul
tural stnkes was reached yesterday
with the findings of the National
Committee for the Defense of Po
litical Prisoners. Their net findings:
strikers were right, were abused.
Fiist came .the strikes in Tulare
cotton fields (reported specially in
the Daily last October), then came
strikes in other parts of California's
agricultural belt (apples, peaches,
etc.), violence generally, killings not
isolated.
StefTens Enters Lists
To the economic battle scene
lushed intellectuals, some pinkish,
some red. Local big names: Lincoln
Steffens, Ella Winter, Langston
Hughes, Marie Short, Sara Reamer.
The local committee found: vio
lence by sheriffs in the face of
peaceful, though horribly underpaid,
workers, five-year-old kids picking
cotton, wholesale infringement on
civil rights.
In the face of these conditions,
committee mustered resolutions:
suspension' of gun permits during
strike turmoils, bringing to immedi
ate justice of the violence-inciters
(none have been as yet). Further,
police should slop protecting strik
ers from gun-toting farmers, should
not enter the fight to break strikes,
but only to maintain order.
Local Methods
Well-known to all is the practice
of some local police to break strikes
by jailing workers on grounds of
using obscene language, vagrancy,
and other phoney charges. (Cussing
police not unknown, declare many
familiar with guardians of the law.)
' Further protested was the practice
of some judges to defeat strikes by
exhorbitani bails, delayed trials, etc.
Then clamoring for labor funda
mentals the committee demanded
living wages for workers and aboli
tion of the strike injunction.
Remembering that Roosevelt was
President, the committee demanded
abolition of child labor (presidential
hobby), and adherence to the col
lective bargaining provisions of the
codes.

to strike, appears on page two.)
