# "World Turning to God," Maintains Fresno Cleric
## 
### 
The modern world is turning back
to God, despite the fact that there
has been an eclipse in religion. This
was the central idea of the sermon
yesterday morning which was de
livered by Dr. Henderson of the
Fresno Congregational Church.
Dr. Henderson further stated that
even the great men of science be
lieved in religion, using Thomas
Iluxley as an example of one who
said that science' and religion each
had a place in a man's life and that
he could not get along without
either.
Religion, he concluded, was not
something that, could' be turned on
and ofT like a pump, but should be
with one all the lime.
