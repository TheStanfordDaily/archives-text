## Statistics Expert to Give Third Lecture In Air Series 
### 
Third in the series of Stanford
educational talks, Professor Theo
dore J. Kreps of the Graduate
School of Business over radio sta
tion KPO at 7:45 o'clock tonight.
Recently returned from a meeting
of the American Economic Associa- !
tion in Philadelphia, he will take I
for his theme the unemployment [
problem in the United States today !
and the best means of combatting it. |
Shows Unemployment Trend
Dr. Kreps actively participated in 1
the round table discussions of the :
American Statistical Association.!
7 I
which met at the same time. Ac- I
cording to the departmental report j
issued by him on his return "a j
scrutiny of the facts seems to indi- i
cate that the increase in unem- j
ployment in March, 1933, over the !
average amount in 1929. was about !
10,500,000, and over the present I
about 7,500,000."
We run the risk of having even
more overproduction than we had in
1929, according to Dr. Kreps, if in
dustrial output recovers to a suffi
cient extent to absorb the total num- !
ber of trained workers in the pro- |
duction of material things. On the',
other hand, we have at present a !
real opportunity to develop our civi
lization, but this will of course de 7 i
pend upon the development of an
active culture conscience among all j
peoples.
Relief vs. Culture
"The real competition for the tax
payers' dollars is that between re
lief funds and the desire for fur
therance of the civic cultural inter
ests," states Professor Kreps, and it j
is expected that this interesting an- ;
gle of the present day economic !
problem will occupy a good portion j
of his allotted time on the air.
The radio series, inaugurated two :
weeks ago by Dr. Ray Lyman Wil
bur, presents to radio audiences!
many of the foremost educators in
the various departments of the uni
versity. These men will discuss and
try to explain the man social prob
lems of the day.
