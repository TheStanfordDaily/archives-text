# Darkness Halts Campus Dining; Roble Girls Sing
## 
### DICK STROUSE 
"What were you doing when the
lights went out?"
Such did the campus ask Satur
day morning, and the answer was
not "Waiting for a street car."
For from 6:31 to 6:37 o'clock Fri
day night, Stanford and Palo Alto
were plunged into the shivering,
dismal darkness of ancient Neo
lithic times. The world went on,
but it did so without that most use
full of modern inventions named
electricity.
Stanford at Dinner
Stanford was at dinner, and Stan
ford learned that the location of
Stanford's several mouths is diffi
cult of ascertainment when the j
lighls arc out. Particularly at night j
time. Dripping spoonfuls of deli
cious stewed prunes and forks
twined about with luscious spinach
paused in their short, trips from
plate to esophagus when the omni
potent electric juice from the main j
line to the Palo Alto district tem
porarily ceased humming through
the wires.
At Roble, a gentle or Stanford j
woman type of pandemonium broke j
loose. With husky bus-boy and
handsome little male hashers lin- j
ing the walls, that goodly proportion
of the "800" that decorates the Bas
tille tittered and screamed, giggled
and felt uncomfortable. Then some
one lapped on her glass with her j

knife—the traditional Ruble method j
of obtaining attention.
The tinkle silenced the cringing
horde. And suddenly there burst J
forth, even as did the "Marseillaise" j
in 1789, the soprano strains of "Come
Join the Band."' Everyone came and
joined. Roble maidens were sing- ;
ing to keep up their courage.
Sequoia Blackness
Over at Sequoia the rat-race of
eating became the rat-race of howl
ing as blackness hid the hall's beau
tifully decorated walls. Someone >
threw a date; someone retaliated by
thrawing the seed back at the first j
someone. The dining-room was half '
empty; those who remained used the
blackness as an unexpected excuse
to raise hell.
The Delta Chis, San Francisco
bound, were not aware of the catas
trophe until they returned and j
learned that their electric clock was j
six never-to-bc-regained minutes
behind time. The Breakers' usual
composure remained the Breakers'
usual composure with or without
lights. The notorious Gruesome
Grotto took on an enhanced grue
someness; and the D.G.'s Edward
ran hither and also yon lustily ;
shouting "Sac-reni-men-to. Sacr
rem-men-to."
And then all was quiet. Over
Stanford, even as over Abraham
Lincoln's study table, wavered the
■ioft flicker of candle-light.
