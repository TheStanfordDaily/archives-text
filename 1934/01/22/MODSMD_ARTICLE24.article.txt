# INDIAN CAGERS SHOW UP WELL IN U.C. DEFEAT
## Hal Eifert Responsible For Victory as California Wins 43-34 MANY FOULS CALLED Keith Topping Stars For Stanford Team 
### Charles Chappell 
Showing a considerably improved
jbrand of basketball although losing
1 43 to 34, Stanford's cagers surprised
a non-capacity crowd at the Stan
ford Pavilion Saturday night by
! keeping pa c e wil h California
through most of the route in the
| first game of the series, only losing
I because of the super-shooting abil -
! ity of Captain Hal Eifert of the
Bears.
Eifert alone can be credited with
'the downfall of the Indians. With
lan ordinary forward taking the
I place of the star CalifoVnian, Stan
ford might easily have* won, for
I even the best of lesser men are usu
ally satisfied with some 10 points
fewer than Eifert's total of 21. But
Hal Eifert is no ordinary forward,
as sundry opponents of the Bears
can testify, and thereby hangs the
reason for California's 9-point mar
j gin over Stanford.
Topping Stands Out
Keith Topping, as usual, was out
| standing for the Indians with 11
J points to hi.s credit, despite the fact
I that he was closely guarded
I throughout the evening. Arnie An
' derson paired with Topping at the
i other forward post in capable style,
[scoring eight points and showing
J the early season form that earned
him a first-string job.
Captain Hal Edelen at center and
Charlie Rogers at guard turned in
good games, while Gordy Malla
tratt at the other guard made up
for his lack of height by playing a
scrappy, aggressive game. A1 Page
; also showed up well at guard, ful
| filling his reputation for being one
I of the fastest men on the team.
Fouls Mar Game
Numerous fouls, 33 altogether,
j marred the contest although both
; teams profited about the same in the
i matter of successful free throws,
Stanford making good pn 10, Cali-
I fornia on 9.
Bones Coughlin celebrated his re
turn to the California lineup by
i carrying off foul honors, going out
1 of tho game with four personals and
! also being credited with two tech
; nical fouls for not seeing things just
■■ as the referee saw them.
Although Coach Bunn's men
j kept pacc with the Bears until
near the end of the first half, the
Blue and Gold lead was never
headed after the first minute vr
so of play when Topping gave
Stanford a brief 3 to 1 advantage.
Toward the end of the half Ei
fert and Englchard started tossing
the hall through the net to in-
I crease California's lead from 14-13
; to 26-17 by the time the period
ended.
Topping started off the second
half by caging a setup and a few
| minutes later Rogers dribbled
| through the whole California team
for the most spectacular goal of the
' game. Page then followed with an
| other setup to bring Stanford to
