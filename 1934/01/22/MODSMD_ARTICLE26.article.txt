# RIGHT TO STRIKE
## 
### 
We lionr Inlk about how the brain-trusters are socializ
ing America; and men like Mark Sullivan actually get wor
ried over the question, hut fundamentally the creed, "rug
ged individualism," still riegns supreme, though a hit rag
ged in spots.
ruder rugged individualism, the right of men to fire
their employees is recognized hy all capitalists. Hut what
few realize is that a right to lire carries with it the corol
lary, the right to strike. In short, either side can plav
"freeze-out" in the economic warfare.
Hut while no one would think to treat a boss who fired
some corn-husker as some special sort of horrid person,
everyone begins to class strikers with communists, and
oilier objects of public fear and horror.
Being neither capitalist nor worker, the whole problem
is academic, free of emotion, and therefore easy to solve.
We neither froth when one is fired nor when one strikes.
Hut as people generally treat strikers as criminals or
near criminals, we have some nasty situations arising. Our
legal protections are often discarded when dealing with
strikers, especially where the strikers are transients and
therefore do not vole for sheriff. If the mob attacks strikers,
the attack is condoned, even praised. People who "break"
strikes by force are looked upon as something akin to heroes
especially if thev carry flags or advertise in the local
paper. .
The policy of condoning mob force, for any purpose, has
been growing during the present excitement over the N.R.A.
A war-like hysteria has been developing and anyone who
can justify his actions under the Blue Eagle, swells with
patriotism and then proceeds merrily to beat up a striker
or two.
Of course, some of the strikers are tough babies, no
doubt; but still the courts are available, and should be used
in preference to shotguns.
In a socialized stale like Italy, no one strikes and no
one tires; but until that day, when and if, the right to strike
should be recognized and protected as one of the merry
incidents of the right to tire.
