Those who arc inclined to laugh at higher education,
break down and guffaw when they see students making out
a program. The entire conversation revolves around hours
and units, never about subjects. "1 need a nine o'clock; 1
need 5 units; 1 need units in Zoological Sciences." Never,
"I want some American History; I need some English Liter
ature," etc., etc.
The whole thing is placed on a business basis: much
akin to a butcher weighing hamburger, and yet with none
of his finesse and good humor.
This hamburger-like method of,education is only natu
ral because the average student doesn't know as much about
his courses as the butcher does about his meat.
To rectify this situation if possible, Dr. Wrenn of Voca
tional Guidance has planned a series of lectures to explain
to new students the various University departments. One
representative from each division will address students on
bis particular branch of higher education.
It is a sound plan because the abysmal ignorance of the
average student in choosing his major subject is a thing of
pity. The average student thinks of history as nothing but
the memorization of dates; English is grammar; political
science is either an unknown quantity or civics. Economics
is thought of as the study of how to skyrocket yourself into
tin* big money; it is very popular on this misguided notion.
If the professors selected attempt to give the straight
storv and do not attempt to "sell" their department, all will
be well. We hope all will be well.
