# Rolphing and Lynching
## 
### 
The word Rolphing lias not spread, I>lll the word lynch
ing lias. Al a recent radical meeting in San Jose, we heard
of 110 less than five varieties of lynching.
There is legal lynching, extra-legal lynching, moral
lynching, intellectual lynching, and just plain lynching.
The lirst (legal lynching) refers to the hanging of those
we feel should not he hanged. The second (extra-legal)
refers lo the typical mob-killing those gay lillle Rolph
parties. Moral and intellectual lynching are not quite as
painful nor as permanent as the rope kind hut are perni
cious in their way. Thcv refer to the way minorities are
oppressed.
And of course the category lynching covers evil gen
â€¢ erallv. Thus spinach would he dietary lynching. The
Bawl-Out is academic lynching. And to please campus
cynics, we suppose that the Daily is journalistic lynching.
While on the subject of lynching, it might be well to note
that the man who admits he instigated the San .lose affair
i<as not been tried; and that Rolph is still governor.
There is high hope, however, of rectifying the latter.
