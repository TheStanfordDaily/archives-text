The "great adventure" for three southern California youths has begun
â€”a trip from Los Angeles to Honolulu in a 34-foot craft built in a
garage by a young boatbuilder who had never sailed before. Dair N.
Long, 19, son of John B. Long, secretary and general manager of the
California Newspaper Publishers' Association, and Mrs. Long, is the
builder-skipper of the craft. Two high school chums, Arthur R. Hoff
man jr, and Burton Aborn, all pictured above on their craft, are
making the voyage.
