At the Stanford Theatre
It is such a treat not to be greeted
in a musical by the puss-faced Ruby
Keeler and the cipher-faced Dick
Powell that one can forgive this
opus almost anything. For as a mu-
I sical it is above the average, and
i even departs .slightly from the aver
! age—ii' only in the fact that thV>
! backstage setting is missing.
This is a pleasantly innocuous tale
I of Dolores Del Rio, engaged to Raoul
Roulein and in love with Gene Ray
mond—with incidental complications
over the opening of her father's hos
telry in Rio de Janeiro. As usual,
| the film's makers are not greatly
i hampered* by the plot, or by the
I mere physical limitations of space I
but manage to do just about the
possibilities on land, this film takes
'to the air, with results neither bet
i ter nor worse than on land. Vin- i
j cent Youmans' music is good, par- !
j ticularly "Orchids in the Moon
j light." The "Carioca" number is :
! definitely overdone, and becomes
, distinctly tiresome after the first 1
I half hour or so.
j Fred Astaire, in case any should
] inquire, does a very adroit job of
I stealing the show; not only does he,
contribute a fine exhibition of danc
i ing, of which he is a master, but
j .shows himself also a comedian of
i distinct talent and charm. He ft |
supported by Ginger Rogers, who
| provides a modicum of comedy, !
dancing, and song.
Raymond and Miss Del Rio are a
; very attractive pair of leads, and
i provide a charming romantic back
ground. —Chapin
