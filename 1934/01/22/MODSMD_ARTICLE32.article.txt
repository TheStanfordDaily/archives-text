misses rather badly (as such films j
j are wont to do), by reason of wan- |
| dering script and sloppy direction.

And this, despite the fact that there
are several good dramatic moments,
and a few good performances.
The taTe of the Boy and Girl in
Trouble is this time laid in a girls'
camp, of which the girl is a mem
ber; the boy is a struggling medical
student at a nearby school. The pic
ture works itself into quite a lather
over the fact that the two are too
poor to marry, and finally solves
itself with their marraige—which is
not strictly fair.
One, of the incidental characters
is the young woman who is head
of the camp, admirably played by
Kay Johnson. Miss Johnson achieves
a maturity of interpretation which
is hard on the less experienced
members of the cast, and which in
cidentally makes one wonder why
she is seen so infrequently on the
screen.
Dorothy Wilson's performance as
the heroine is not too consistent,
while being at times very convinc
ing. In the character, as well as in
her interpretation of it, one is re
minded of the far more moving
"Maedchen in Uniform."
Douglass Montgomery's hero is an
earnest piece of work, and yet the
character by no means clearly de
fined. —Chapin
