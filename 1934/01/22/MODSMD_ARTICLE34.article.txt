## CAGE CROWDS UNGENTLEMANLY LOT 
### 
We don't know why it is, but bas
ketball crowds never fail to strike
us as being Lhe most unpleasant in
the sporting world. Catcalls, bronx
cheers, boos, hisses, and the high
pitched scream of the juvenile ele
ment always abound in disagree
able quantities, and the nearness of
the crowd to the players and offi
cials must annoy those gentlemen
no end.
Still, if the fan has contributed
his four-bits or so to the kitty,
he must conclude that the act au
tomatically gives him the oppor
tunity to exercise his constitu
tional rights to the utmost. And
he never fails to do so.
Thus basketball, with baseball,
seems to act on the human machine
in such a way as to bring out all of
Ihe loathsome qualities. The differ
ence between the cage and the dia
mond sport being, that the specta
tor comprehends more of the latter,
knows the rules and has less oppor
tunity to yell out of turn.
