# SOMEONE DIZZYOFFICIALS OR CROWD?
## 
### 
In basketball, c-ither the officials
or the crowds must be vastly ig
norant. of the finer points to be j
found in Spaulding's Guide. We are
inclined to believe it is the crowd,
and would offer up the hope that
they consult the book before show
ering disapprobation on the heads of
the sweating officials.
Perhaps it is all the fault of our
referees, but we would like to
ask, "Who has ever seen a good
official, for comparison?"
The best crowds for sportsman
ship in this vicinity are football and
track, with the edge going to track
by a good margin. The football
crowd has been declared to be the
most learned in the sport; if any
thing, they know too much, being
always ready generously to aid the
misfortunate dull wit beside them on
the finer points of play and the ig
norance of the Umtywalla coach.
