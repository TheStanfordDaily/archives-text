# ANNOUNCING GUY WAS IN THEIR HAIR
## 
### 
And, speaking of spectators, a
wise gentleman by the name of Jack
Patrick, an old Stanford football
captain, and crony of Dink Temple
ton, had the Stanford team infu
riated in their rugby match at Seals
Stadium Saturday.
The estimable Mr. Patrick, an
nouncing the game over the loud
speaker, never failed to comment
adversely on the ethical and moral
aspects of a Stanford pJay, giving a
round ribbing to Captain Chuck
White, and Johnny Pieisner, among
others. On one occasion, Patrick
went so far as to arouse the ire of
Mr. Pete Redding, the referee.
Patrick sung out "Offside," on a
play which the referee ruled on
side, and perfectly legal, which it
was, from our viewpoint. Redding
stopped the game, and addressing
the bank of loudspeakers in the
far corner of the lield. said: "The
announcer will please tend to his
announcing, and allow me to
make the decisions in this game."
Which must have injured Pat
rick's feelings, for that worthy ven
tured no more remarks for the du
ration of the game. â€”Hamilton
