# Office Records Reveal 43 "Rolled" Last Quarter
## 
### 
Registrar's office figures show that
43 unfortunates were disqualified
from the University last quarter, or,
as the Stanford rough would have
it, this number "rolled" at the close
of the fall period.
Out of this number, nine wore
second and final disqualifications,
while the remaining 34 were first
flunkouts. Early reinstatements
were asked for by 23 of these. In
addition to this number, the border
line was reached by 197, who found
themselves on probation when they
returned to school after the holi
days.
