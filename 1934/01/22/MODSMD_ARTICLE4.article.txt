# Another Shake-up?

### 
Japan's 68-year-old minister of ;
war, Sahaido Araki, idol of the army I
and navy, and incidentally about'
70,000,000 military minded Japanese !
subjects, resigned his post today.
Reputed reason: illness, more prob- j
to save his own neck.
Representing the par excellence of
Nipponese militarism, big navy and
army a-la-Hearst for Japan, he has !
been practical dictator of the island
empire for the past six months. Now ;
who are the remaining powers- J
that-be going to appoint in his !
place? i
