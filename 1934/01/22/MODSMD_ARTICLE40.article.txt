## 
### Jack Newman 
Winter quarter's qualifying rounds
came to an end this week-end with
Jack Hoerner winning the coveted
number two position; Lawson Little
is seeded into the first place. Hoer
ner was tied for the second posi
tion last fall, but lost to Don Ed
wards in the play off. His scores
were 77-73.
Two strokes behind him were
Dick Gicldings and Don Edwards,
deadlocked with 152's. Edwards
scraped into his with an erratic
74-78.
Thompson Fifth
Safe in the fifth position was Bob
Thompson, who has been coming
right up lately. He played a posi
tion seven last quarter. His score
was 75-78-153. Bill Hoelle at num
ber six with a 79-75 is closer to the
top this time than he has been in
his several years on the team. He
was in eleventh berth last fall.
Close on Hoelle's heels was Dan
Moser who has improved more
than any of the others on the squad.
He came from somewhere far down
the list last quarter to make him
self the seventh man on the team.

His score was a 76-80-15C5.
Early season favorite to take the
second place, Tom Dwyer went to
pieces on his second round and had
a hard time coming through for the
eighth berth. It took him 83 for the :
second, which paired with his first
round medal 74, gave him a total
157.
Though now in the hospital,
Morse Erskine dropped from his last j
quarter's seventh place to a tie for j
ninth berth. A newcomer but a
very hard worker, "Sten" Sheppard,
broke into the team from some- ;
where, putting Erskine's grasp on j
the number nine in jeopardy with
his 78-80-158. He is from Sacra- !
mento Junior College and is a for- .
mer teammate of Tom Dwyer and
Ray Gehan.
After giving up golf for tennis for j
a quarter, Hugh Mellon made the i
eleventh place in his first try for 1
varsity laurels, BZ-77-159. In the i
| last place three men are tied, Gene
Brown, minor sports carnival chain- I

Winter quarter's qualifying rounds
came to an end this week-end with
Jack Hoerner winning the coveted
number two position; Lawson Little
is seeded into the first place. Hoer
ner was tied for the second posi
tion last fall, but lost to Don Ed
wards in the play off. His scores
were 77-73.
Two strokes behind him were
Dick Gicldings and Don Edwards,
deadlocked with 152's. Edwards
scraped into his with an erratic
74-78.
Thompson Fifth
Safe in the fifth position was Bob
Thompson, who has been coming
right up lately. He played a posi
tion seven last quarter. His score
was 75-78-153. Bill Hoelle at num
ber six with a 79-75 is closer to the
top this time than he has been in
his several years on the team. He
was in eleventh berth last fall.
Close on Hoelle's heels was Dan
Moser who has improved more
than any of the others on the squad.
He came from somewhere far down
the list last quarter to make him
self the seventh man on the team.

His score was a 76-80-15C5.
Early season favorite to take the
second place, Tom Dwyer went to
pieces on his second round and had
a hard time coming through for the
eighth berth. It took him 83 for the :
second, which paired with his first
round medal 74, gave him a total
157.
Though now in the hospital,
Morse Erskine dropped from his last j
quarter's seventh place to a tie for j
ninth berth. A newcomer but a
very hard worker, "Sten" Sheppard,
broke into the team from some- ;
where, putting Erskine's grasp on j
the number nine in jeopardy with
his 78-80-158. He is from Sacra- !
mento Junior College and is a for- .
mer teammate of Tom Dwyer and
Ray Gehan.
After giving up golf for tennis for j
a quarter, Hugh Mellon made the i
eleventh place in his first try for 1
