# SMOOTH FRESHMAN CAGE TEAM SWAMPS U.C. 47-17
## 
### MORT D'EVELYN 
Three Red teams presenting
equally smooth passing attacks, plus
a guard and a forward playing hot
basketball, gave Jimmy Bradshaw's
frosh quintet a one-sided 47-17 win
over the California frosh Saturday
night as a preliminary to the var
sity game.
California was out-classed not
only because their practice sessions
and previous games have been few
and far between but because three
of their most promising players
have been lost during the past two
weeks through scholastic ineligibil
ity. However, Saturday night's play
showed that Bill Higgin's has the
nucleus to a powerful quintet in
Sparks, Herwig, and Young, that the
Blue and Gold yearlings will be able
to press any frosh five later in the
season.
Stanford Takes Lead
Stanford was always far •in the
lead, after Sparks of the Cubs
swished the opening bucket' of the
game in the first minute, because
forward Bill Quade was ringing the
bucket as he was not last Tuesday
night against the Bronco frosh.
Quade, who tanks nine field goals
one game and one the next, put the
frosh into an early lead and then
Carl Schott. joined him in a scoring
spree which left the frosh leading
30-7 at half time.
During !he Babes' eight past
games Schott has seldom been on
the floor, never tallied, but came
through the Cal frosh game as a
scoring threat. The stocky guard,
who was playing third-string last
Tuesday, has a peculiar shooting
style which looks terrible, because
unorthodox, when he misses but
which is spectacular with its deadly
accuracy when he's hot. Using no
arch and shooting for the rim,
Schott rifled several long shots that

pion; Bill Shepherd, and Ed Beuler
with IGO.

hit the far rim with a smaclc,
dropped straight down like a bul
let. At other times Schott showed
that he was playing no fluke game
by skilfully dribbling through the ,
Cub defense to lay in a set-up,
tallying another time on a follow-up
shot.
Turner, Moore Good
The frosh outsmarted the Berk
eley boys besides outplaying them,
Howell Turner slipping away from
the Cal guards several times to
score on push-ins. Moore played
steady at guard, dropped in six out
of seven free throws, while Erlen
heim, Huff, Smith, and Proctor
looked good for the reserves.
The Babe victory was tempered
by the loss of Howard Erlenheim,
who was sent to the hospital v/ith a
dislocated knee, necessitating a mi
nor operation early last night. Erl
enheim finally got his chance after
playing good, hard-fighting basket
ball -for weeks, swished a field goal
from the center of the court the
first time he got his hands on the
ball, then had to leave the game
when his knee gave way.
Three games will fill the frosh
schedule during the coming week.
Commerce tomorrow night, the for
midable St. Mary's frosh on Friday,
and Stockton High Saturday night
Will give the yearlings a chance to
remedy a sometimes inefficient de
fense.

Three Red teams presenting

a guard and a forward playing hot
basketball, gave Jimmy Bradshaw's
frosh quintet a one-sided 47-17 win
over the California frosh Saturday
night as a preliminary to the var

California was out-classed not
only because their practice sessions
and previous games have been few
and far between but because three
of their most promising players
have been lost during the past two
weeks through scholastic ineligibil
ity. However, Saturday night's play
showed that Bill Higgin's has the

Sparks, Herwig, and Young, that the

Stanford was always far •in the

During !he Babes' eight past

through the Cal frosh game as a
scoring threat. The stocky guard,
who was playing third-string last

style which looks terrible, because
unorthodox, when he misses but
which is spectacular with its deadly
accuracy when he's hot. Using no

shot.
Turner, Moore Good
The frosh outsmarted the Berk
