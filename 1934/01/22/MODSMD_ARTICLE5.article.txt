# Trouble in Spain
## 
### 
More trouble bobbed up in'turbu
lent Spain yesterday. This time it
is the case of the four Americans
who supposedly attacked a civil
guard on Mallorca, spent some time
in jail, caused international diplo
matic tempest.
Efforts of U.S. Ambassador Bow
ers had all but pried them loose,
when news came of their re-jailing.
Reason: rumor that they had at
tempted to escape. Irked, U.S. envoy
protested; Spanish foreign minister
said he would investigate. Chancer
are that no "incident" will occur,
whole thing will blow over.
