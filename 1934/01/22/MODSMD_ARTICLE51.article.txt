After holding down the second
place on last year's freshman team
for all fall quarter, George Kuklin
ski came back to Stanford to take
the first place on this year's fresh
man squad with a 70-79.
Biggest surprise and upset in the
season's golf is the winning of the
second frosh berth by George Ber
key, small, unassuming Chicago
boy. Far down the ladder during
autumn quarter chiefly because his
shots were not long enough for the
course, he made an 83-79-162 to put
his position on ice.
Still rather a disappointment, the
much-heralded San Francisco high
school champ Dalton Henderson
came back from an 85 to take the
third position with his second round
of 78. Stoddard took fourth with
a 164.
Showing that he can play golf,
Welch came through with a second
round after his first 87. His total is
165 and fifth place.
The final three places on the
squad were taken by Chable, a
newcomer; King Brown, and How
ard Clark. The last two tied for
the seventh place.
