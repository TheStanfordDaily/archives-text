# PUBLIC FORUM 10 FEATURE DEBATER AND L.I.D. LEADER
## 
### 
Public Forum, draughty vehicle
for the Stanford wind of freedom, j
pushes off into the campus eye |
Wednesday night at 8:15 o'clock in
Room 202, English corner, • an- ;
nounces Hal von Breton.
Chief contestants for this week's |
Forum are Matthew Evans, of the j
local L.I.D. chapter, and Austin
Fife, varsity debater. The subject, i
postponed from last quarter, reads'
academically for the benefit of the |
debaters, but as far as the audience !
is concerned, says lhat the two will
argue the question of whether or ]
not we can permanently recover
without a more equitable distribu- 1
tion of wealth.
In actuality the discussion will
amount to but one thing: a radical '
versus a conservative. Evans was
picked purposedly for his radical i
views, and Fife for his willingness !
to defend a patched-up "status
quo." The two main speakers will 1
bombast each other for 10 minutes |
apiece, after which they will sub- j
mit to questioning from the audi- '
ence for a period of time as yet un
determined. After this" gruelling j
test the meeting will be turned !
over to the listeners on the floor, |
with the usual five-minute time
limit attached to individual speeches. 1
Following probably an hour and j
a half of arguing one way and the I
other, a vote will be taken to indi- j
cate the opinion of the registered j
students and faculty members pres
ent only. Outsiders may take liberal ,
part in the discussions, but may not !
vote.
Selection of a chairman has not .
yet been made, but will be an- 1
nounced later.
