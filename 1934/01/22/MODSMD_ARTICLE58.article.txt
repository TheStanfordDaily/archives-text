# VIENNA BOY CHOIR SINGS THIS WEEK IN SAN FRANCISCO
## 
### 
Boys of 8 to 15 years from the
j most famous ecclesiastical choir in
I Europe, will be heard in San Fran
cisco this week.
Because women are not permitted
by the church to sing sacred mu
sic, the Wiener Saengerknaben, like
â–  the Sistine Choir, was formed as an
1 adjunct to the Imperial Chapel some
four centuries ago. Then it disap
i peared with the Hapsburg monarchy
j at the close of the World War.
But Father Schnitt out of his pri
j vate funds re-established the choir
i six years later, feeding and educat
! ing the boys. In an effort to support 1
I itself the choir turned to secular 1
i music, to the light operas of Mo
! zart, Haydn, Humperdinck which
i now find a place on every one of
! their programs. "I have been told," )
I said Father Schnitt, "that after
! hearing the boys, people don't want
i to hear Mozart by anyone else."
For their two San Francisco ap-
I pearances at the Opera House this |
I year, the Singing Boys of Vienna i
have prepared comic operas new to
their repertoire, Offenbach's "Wed
ding by Lanternlight" for Wednes
! day evening and Lortzing's "The
Opera Rehearsal" for Sunday after
! noon.
