# ABOLITION OF CARD STUNTS IS CONSIDERED
## Rally Committee Suggests That B.A.C. Help Financially 
### Frank Orr 
No more rooters' stunts?
That is the possibility unless the
| 8.A.C., game - controlling, profit
! collecting body, appropriate funds
to help pay expenses for card stunts
used at football games.
Rally committee members, meet
ing last night, mentioned criticisms
of traditional between-halves card
pictures, suggested that money be
appropriated by the B.A.C. to help
out if that body considers the stunts
i a drawing card for game sale tickets.
Fans Want Stunts
Suggesting that spectators con
| sider stunts as much a part of the
i game as the actual play and that the
Board of Athletic Control collects
profits from ticket sales, some mem
bers insisted it was only logical that
the Board help pay for cards and
labels used.
Criticism by several sports writers
was cited as evidence against con
tinuance of the stunts, but the con
sensus was that spectators, students,
and most writers would object to
their discontinuance.
Committee Appointed
A1 Eushton, B Kellogg, Miriam
Kropp, and A1 Peache were ap
pointed by Chairman Stan Beaubaire
a committee to confer with B.A.C.
officials to discuss plans for card
j appropriations.
The annual Masque Ball and va
| riations of the usual King and Queen
j contest were discussed, possibilities
! ranging from abolition of the rev
] enue-raising contests to a suggestion
|to auction off the privilege of es
! corting the Queer.. Probable date,
j not yet approved by the Ex Com
| mittee: April 27.
