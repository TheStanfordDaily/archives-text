# F.R.'s New Deal Day
## 
### 
F.R. set .some more wheels rolling
again today to protect his CWA and
PWA from graft. He figures that if {
there are going to be scandals, the I
donkeys or jack-asses as the case
may be had better uncover them
before the G.O.P. does. "Irregulari
ties" are cropping out in Pennsyl
vania, California.
More ding; are being passed out
for congressmen, national commit
tee members who are practicing law '
in Washington. Meanwhile the Sen- !
ate passed the two billion farm j
mortgage bill, is getting ready to
ding the St. Lawrence Waterway |
Treaty.
As Roosevelt talked gold with
"mystery man" Warren, money and
banking with Morgenthau, NRA'
with Johnson, and Cuba with vari- |
ous ambassadors, the market re-1
mained uncertain, was awaiting de
velopments not yet forthcoming.
