# Quad Cameramen Reveal Roble Balcony Adventure
## 
### FRANCES AYRES 
There's never a dull moment in
the life of a Quad photographerâ€”
ask Ernie Hartmann and Don Han
son, who have been toting a camera
all year through rain and cold, into
sorority houses ahd women's dor
mitories, for the sake of pictures.
These intrepid cameramen will
go anywhere. They had the dis
tinction this year of being the first
men to take pictures above the
first floor of Ruble when they got
snapshots of the Pajatnarino from
the vantage point of the balcony
oIT a sponsor's room.
Embarrassing experiences a r c
often their lot. For instance, the
time the camera slipped and fell
downstairs .it a crucial point in a
Chi Omega fashion show-tea. Or
the time tho flash failed to click
when a crowd of celebrities was
nicely posed, just before the special
train took off for the U.S.C. game.
Booing means nothing to Quad

cameramen. They dared the derision
of the crowd at football rallies last
quarter, and Friday night were the
only photographers allowed in the
Pavilion fpr the California basket
ball game. For this privilege they
received more than their share of
enthusiastic razzberries from Stan
lord's customary basketball supply.
The latest invasions of photog
raphers Hartmann and Hanson were
into sorority houses, during Prefer
ence and Pledge nights.
Snaps of the former, calculated
to move the rough to laughter,
show Stanford's fairest, dancing
with each other and beaming
smiles of politeness.
Pledge night pictures portray fur
coated freshmen, suitcases in hand,
stepping into open doorways where
the sorority sisters, aglow with girl
ish triumph and smiles await them.
All of which makes the life of a
Quad cameraman- if a hard one
worth living.
