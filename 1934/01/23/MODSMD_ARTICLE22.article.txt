## First Session of Quarter To Be Tomorrow 
### 
With definite selection of a chair
man the only preparation as yet un
completed, Stanford's latest edition
of Public Forum, will open at 8:15
o'clock tomorrow night in Room 202,
English corner, following President.
Wilbur's talk in the Assembly Hall.
Campus L.I.D. chief Matthew
Evans and varsity debater Austin
Fife are the headliners, will deliver
introductory speeches of 10 minutes'
length. Question: in essence, the
problem of whether or not we can
permanently recover from the pres
ent depression without a more equi
table distribution of wealth.
Radical Evans will advocate a re
distribution, debater Fife will de
fend the "status quo" with reserva
tions. Following these introductory
presentations of the question, a pe
riod of time will be set aside during
which the audience will attempt to
stick verbal barbs into the contes
tants. Finally, the meeting will be
thrown open to all who feel the
urge to take the floor either in fa
vor of or against the motion, with a
five-minute time limit on speeches.
At the end of the hour-and-a-half
session, a vote will be taken, regr
istered students and faculty mem
bers only being eligible.
