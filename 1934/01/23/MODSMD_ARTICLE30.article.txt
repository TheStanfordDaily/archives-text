There tire fifteen organizations that are no longer on
(his campus. They were here, cluttering up things, and
getting in Hie hair of 1 lie student hodv hut a courageous
Student Hotly President and a constructive Ex Committee
applied the hoot to these groups.
The procedure was simple, so simple it hurl. Each
campus organization was invited to the Ex Committee to
justify its existence. Those that couldn't were painlessly
exterminated.
During the mad days of the last mad years, it is feared
some of these organizations have crept hack into the fold,
and what is positive is that many other organizations have
attached themselves to the body-student like so many bar
nacles.
** * *
Now colorful barnacles, or attractive barnacles, or hu
morous barnacles, or singing barnacles we can tolerate.
Hut just plain gray, ugly, dead, dumb barnacles? No one
can tolerate them except a mollusk-maniac. And we don't
< veil like clam chowder.
And that is just what these organizations are! They are
here. That is about all you can say about them. Let them
come to the Ex Committee and explain why they are here.
That is not asking 100 much. We will not ask that they
have plans for reforming the World, or even Stanford. All
that would be necessary is that they do something. Or even
if they did nothing, but stood for something high and noble,
we might consider them. Hut those that just were there—
I .'a re and naked without a loin-cloth of an excuse should
be turned over to the fire. Death at sunrise!
* * *
Furthermore, even though nothing resulted it would be
a lot of fun. Ever since the demise of the Junior Opera,
the need of humor on the campus has been felt generally.
Nothing would be finer and funnier than a bunch of
Scalpers attempting to openly explain what they are. Other
groups might be funnier but we can't think of them at this
time. Especially since the Scalpers are sophomores and
sophomores are often very serious, i.e. funny.
His up to the Executive Committee and President
Trautman to act. The invitations should be sent at once.
The acceptances should be prompt. The fun will be high.
The results may be worth while. The cost is slight.
