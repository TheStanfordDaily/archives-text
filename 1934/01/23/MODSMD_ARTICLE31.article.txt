The Stanford Stadium is a big place. II is a nice place.
II has many seats in it. Bill il has no roof. These things
are very well known.
Bill what to do abouj il? That is I lie question before
I lie house. Poor house.
During autumn Saturday afternoons we have football
games in the Stadium. Occasionally, a spring quarter track
meet is staged within the oval walls. Hut generally, it
stands vacant, deserted. Poor stadium.
Of course on moonlight nights, a romantic couple with
;i poetic urge will sil in Section QQ and wonder what the
other X<X,!)!)8 of the Hig (lame crowd arc doing. Hut that is
hardly a substantial use.
Of course, the Hoard of Athletic Control doesn't know
what to do with the Stadium. Poor H.A.C.
The Kditor isn't exactly sure what to do with il. Poor
Editor.
Does the Campus know? The Daily will forward any
and all suggestions to the H.A.C., President Wilbur, or the
Trustees. Send them in; or we will be forced lo say, "Poor
sludcnls."
