# Goodbye Hello
## 
### 
There was ;i time when busies were Hie wheeled death
engines, when hnslles were no jokes; then every Stanford
student :is he passed another Stanford student, showed his
teeth and said, "Hello."
The Daily eommenled lillle on the siluaiton.
Then came the era when the Daily bragged of this
grand tradition. That was a sure sign that il was weak
ening.
This stage was followed bv the period of slow death.
During this stage of the devolution of the "Hello" Spirit,
Kditors shrieked, clamored for the return to early Stan
lord democracy. That period ended some two years ago
in bitter disappointment. Time refused to about-face for
Ihe Daily and the "Hello" Spirit passed from mortal view.
Xow, the thing hangs on, mortal form gone, but still il
hangs on. The awful thing has become a ghost, wandering
in the Hast Arboretum, and past the Museum.
It just dawned on us that the thing should be given a
decent burial to stop ils nightly stalks through the campus.
So, goodbye "Hello" Spirit. Tears, lump in throat, swal
low . . . Blackout.
