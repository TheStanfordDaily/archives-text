IS ZAT SO (Gleason-Taber)
At the Community Theatre
Following the Community Thea
tre's splendid production of Night
Over Taos, Is Zal So was like a dash
of cold water. There was none of
the former's vivid pictorial quality,
none of the rhythm and color, none
of the really fine direction. Nor did
the play, chosen perhaps for the
sake of the season's variety, even
offer any opportunity for witty dia
logue or clever complications of
farce. The play is- a curio of the
early twenties, a symposium of
chestnuts, the granddaddy of the
piay in which at the end the Eng
lishman is saying "t'ink" and the
tough is saying "righto." Unfortu
nately, too, I have a quite personal
prejudice against the "Sez you—
yeh sez me" type of comedy ad in
finitum.
With so little to work with, the di
rector and actors did the best they
could. They kept up a fast pace (it
had to be fast to skim over the weak
jokes) with the exception of a slow
and irksome drunk in the first act.
Without Pat Gleason and Don Has
call, for whom the rest of the cast
acted as stooges, the play would
have been unbearable. Gleason, be
sides staging a convincing bout with
Darwin Peavy in the second act, de
fied the script by making the prize
fighter seem real and likeable. Play
ing in a broad bashful manner, he
enhanced his part immeasurably by
trick steps, motions, and added busi
ness of his own.
Hascall, who sometimes exagger
ated even beyond the bounds of
farce, was best in his proposal to
Miss Mestretti, played with charm
and self-possession by Gretchen
Rounds. Alice Hind, George Lea
vens, and John Lawry were success
fully sweet, polished, and cute, re
spectively.
Waldegrave's set was substantial
and roomy, a worthy—though con
trasting—successor to the beautiful
Taos set, with all its technical per
fection. To the play selection com
mittee, a large load of bricks for
wasting the theatre's talented ener
gies in such a trite outmoded un
funny play. It seems really wicked
1o handicap with such poor sterile
material a director capable of pro
ducing the striking mas.s movement
of Taos, many actors who possess
either great personal charm or act
ing ability, and the proved scenic
excellence of the theatre's stage de
signers. —Brauns

Darwin Peavy in the second act, de
fied the script by making the prize
fighter seem real and likeable. Play
ing in a broad bashful manner, he
enhanced his part immeasurably by
trick steps, motions, and added busi
ness of his own.
Hascall, who sometimes exagger
ated even beyond the bounds of
farce, was best in his proposal to
Miss Mestretti, played with charm
and self-possession by Gretchen
Rounds. Alice Hind, George Lea
vens, and John Lawry were success
fully sweet, polished, and cute, re
spectively.
Waldegrave's set was substantial
and roomy, a worthy—though con
trasting—successor to the beautiful
Taos set, with all its technical per
fection. To the play selection com
mittee, a large load of bricks for
wasting the theatre's talented ener
gies in such a trite outmoded un
funny play. It seems really wicked
1o handicap with such poor sterile
material a director capable of pro
ducing the striking mas.s movement
of Taos, many actors who possess
either great personal charm or act
ing ability, and the proved scenic
excellence of the theatre's stage de
signers. —Brauns
IS ZAT SO (Gleason-Taber)
At the Community Theatre
Following the Community Thea
tre's splendid production of Night
Over Taos, Is Zal So was like a dash
of cold water. There was none of
the former's vivid pictorial quality,
none of the rhythm and color, none
of the really fine direction. Nor did
the play, chosen perhaps for the
sake of the season's variety, even
offer any opportunity for witty dia
logue or clever complications of
farce. The play is- a curio of the
early twenties, a symposium of
chestnuts, the granddaddy of the
piay in which at the end the Eng
lishman is saying "t'ink" and the
tough is saying "righto." Unfortu
nately, too, I have a quite personal
prejudice against the "Sez you—
yeh sez me" type of comedy ad in
finitum.
With so little to work with, the di
rector and actors did the best they
could. They kept up a fast pace (it
had to be fast to skim over the weak
jokes) with the exception of a slow
and irksome drunk in the first act.
Without Pat Gleason and Don Has
call, for whom the rest of the cast
acted as stooges, the play would
have been unbearable. Gleason, be
sides staging a convincing bout with
Darwin Peavy in the second act, de
fied the script by making the prize
fighter seem real and likeable. Play
ing in a broad bashful manner, he
enhanced his part immeasurably by
trick steps, motions, and added busi
ness of his own.
