# BULL SESSION
## HONOR THY BLUE BOOK 
### 
i -No one takes very literally the as- j
I sertftn that Stanford men are gen
j tlemen. The statement is at least
I half wrong. To substitute "rough"
, for "gentleman" is to do a grave
injustice to Noah Webster, Emily
i Post, and the Stanford rough.
|
Perhaps it is the recognition of
i this which has brought to the cam
pus the optimistically-termed "hon
or" pledge—that paradoxical imp
I which inhabits the front cover of
. every blue book. It is one of life's
! mysteries where the pledge derived
! its name. Some have decided it was
i devised merely to fill the bluey
! blankness of page, the first. Others
| have traced it to that moral hysteria
' which confuses ends with means.
I More baffling, and inexplicable is
| the question: WHAT IS HONOR
-1 ABLE ABOUT TIIE "HONOR"
' PLEDGE?
|
i Obviously, if Stanford men were |
! gentlemen, the pledge would be a j
i,redundancy; for a gentleman with- !
lout "honor" is, like an Encina mat
! tress, a contradiction in terms.
| YES, BUT —comes the ready an
i swer —in a courtroom even the most
honorable of a men must lake the
! oath. But in a courtroom, everyone
is taken to be a liar and a swindler
: —until proved otherwise. Tradition
! demands an oath; there is nothing
! of logic in its application.
j So we must conclude that the
| powers have recognized the sad
j truth that Stanford men are no uif- j

ferent than the mobs of creatures
who inhabit the outer world.
Granted.
If the rough, whose bristling beard
and rugged face, we have come to
trust —is not adverse to cheating on
exes, of what practical value is the
pledge? The setting out in pen and
ink of a resolution inwardly lack
ing, will not deter the craning neck,
the cocked ear, and the eagle eye.
If the rough, or Indian maid, de
cides to cheat to get grades, noth
ing will stop that urge except aboli
tion of grades.
If we are to call a spade by its
proper name—and a cheat by his—
why not recognize that cheating
does exist, and proceed from there
to the solution. No honest individ
ual has cause to object to a profes
sor in the examination room. Ex
when a professor can be a real con
ami nation time is one of the times
venience.
Regardless of suggested remedies,
it is evident that the "honor" pledge
is s'teriJe. If Stanford men and
women do not cheat, it is because
they do not care to. If they do de
cide to go the way of most flesh,
the pledge does not restrain them.
If it is granted that the pledge
does not encourage fair play, it is
reduced to an absurdity. It becomes
simply a nuisance.
The pledge, unlike man's appen
dix, never had a real purpose.
