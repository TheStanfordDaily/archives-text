# Let 'Em Eat Bread
## 
### 
Hunger strike yesterday broke
loose in Santa Clara's lyiuh-bat
tered county jail. Hooscgow leaders
yammered that two slices of toast for
breakfast and two pieces of bread
for dinner was not satisfying. Other
meals were "okay." All but six in
mates balked at prison breakfast.
