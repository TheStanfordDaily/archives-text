"Fit f EDO VI OFFENSE"
BEWfHSKERED RELIC
Credit Ruisell Ulrich of the Stan
lord Daily staff for a clipping from
R'jyal Brougham's "The Morning
A fter" column in a Seattle sports
sheet concerning Coach John Bunn
;nd"the new so-called (by the B.A.
publicity department) "freedom
Oilen.se."
Quoting:
''In a friendly contradiction I
protest your statement that John
ny Bunn of Stanford has invented
something new in basketball. The
old Skipper Edmundson has been
using what Bunn chooses to call a
'freedom offense' before said Bunn
discarded the ruhber-topped bot
tle.
"The only difference in the play
of Stanford and Washington is
that the Huskies have mastered
each situation more frequently
than the Cards. 'Hec' has been
drilling his teams thoroughly in
fundamentals for years, and does
not depend on plays. The fast
breaking, fast passing, blocking,
etc., are all fundamentals.
"That's all, except to add that
front Stanford's status in the bas
ketball league during the past few
years, there are a few very im
portant fundamentals they have
not mastered as well as their
neighbors, the Bears. That is
tackling, blocking, and running
interference. A! Schuss."
That crack in the last paragraph
is appealing, at any rate.
We have never questioned Coach
Bunn on the invention of the "free
dom offense," but we doubt that he
would claim honors for its concep
tion. Coach Bunn probably feels
that there are very few things new
in any sport, and that the nearest
approach to invention is the use of
old tricks, in adaption to new situa
tions. Which is a bit of genius in
itself.
Bunn has been merely attempting
to adapt mid-western basketball
style to his team, or that's the way
we understand it, at least. And if
Bunn's influence can do nothing
more than inculcate a demand for a
more open game it's worth the ef
fort. â€”Hamilton
