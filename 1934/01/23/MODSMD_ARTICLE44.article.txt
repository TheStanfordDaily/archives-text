# INDIAN RESERVES FACE STRONG O.C. QUINTET TONIGHT
## 
### 
One of the few unbeaten basket
ball teams remaining in the country,
the Olympic Club quintet appears
tonight at the Stanford Pavilion to
show the Indian hoop squad and
Farm fans the five that is reputed
to be the best the Coast has seen in
a number of years.
Not because he is taking the Club
game lightly, but rather because he
wishes to concentrate on the com
ing conference games with U.S.C. in
Los Angeles this week-end, Coach
John Bunn will hold his first-string
out of the game. In fact they will
not even put on suits tonight, but
will work out this afternoon prac
ticing a defense and offense to be
used against the Trojans Friday
and Saturday.
Former College Greats
The Club squad features a group
of players who have all won their
spurs in collegiate competition and
most of whom have had several
years' experience in fast company
since leaving college. Most of the
men on the squad are well over si>?
feet and the Olympics have used
their height to great advantage in
running up big scores.
"Frenchy" Lacombe, former Stan
ford star, will probably see con
siderable action at forward, and it
is reported that A1 Norgard, Indian
grid star who was with the Club
team last season, has returned to
claim his old guard post.
Card Starters Tall
Three former California stars,
Corbin, Kinlana, and Vendt, have
had much to do with the Club suc
cess, while Knowles and Lubin,
giant guard who used to bring
many laughs from Coast Conference
audiences when he was at U.C.L.A.,
will also play. Both of the latter
have played with the Pasadena Ma
jors for the past two seasons.
Bunn will probably start tonight's
game with Hershey at center; Bost
and Nobs, forwards; and Lindsey
and Farber at guards. With the ex
ception of Bost, this is a team of
six-footers or better which should
aid in battling the tall Clubmen.
Tonight's game will give Coach
Bunn a better line on his reserve
strength and those who will make
the trip south this week-end will be
partially selected on tonight's show

1 ing. Hershey's return to playing
form will give the Indians another
I scoring weapon as he is tall enough
to control the tip-off against any of
the Conference centers.
