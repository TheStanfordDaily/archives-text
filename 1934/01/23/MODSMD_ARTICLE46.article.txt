# STRONG UCLA TRACKSTERS TO INVADE FARM IN APRIL
## 
### Warren Breed 
With a powerful array in their
track events, led by Jimmy Lu-
Valle, flashy sepia quarter-miler
and 1.C.4A. 400-meter titleholder,
U.C.L.A.'s "most promising track
team to date" should give Dink
Templeton more than one uncertain
moment when the Bruins invade the
stadium April 14.
Harry Trotter, Brum mentor, has
great reason to care for the colorful
LuValle. His LC.4A. mark 0f"46.9
seconds was the best registered in
the country, or the world, last year
and inferior only to those of Bill
Carr and Ben Eastman in '32.
He is also no slouch in his
scholastic endeavors, boasting a
powerhouse mark of 2.573, just
under the pcrfcct 3.00 ft. Teaming
with him in the relay are Sinclair
Lott, speedy football end; Vejar
and James Miller, two veterans, or
Murphy and Donlon.
The two co-captains, James Mil-

| ler and Bob McLean, have plenty of
capable competition in the hurdles
and sprints, respectively. There is
Fred Anderson, reputedly defeated
but once in freshman and high
i school circles, and Bernie Miller, one
of the Coast's best barrier men two
| seasons ago. All three give indica
tion of running consistently under
15 in the highs and 24 in the lows
all season.
To match KieseT, Abbot and
Thorns, Trotter has McLean, Blath
erwick, and Cheshire, a trio of vet
, erans, and a new face, Fred Brad
ley. Three members of the champion
cross-country team will toil in the
distances — Jackson, Sticher, and
Keim, while a couple of sophs,
, Henry and Murphy, can clip under
j two minutes for two laps.
Heading the field events is the
javelin, with men whipping it 195,
185, and 180 feet. For the jumps,
Westwood has a trio of six-foot
, clearers and a 23-foot man.
