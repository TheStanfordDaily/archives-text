# Cuban Recognition
## 
### 
Mendieta, white hope of Cuba,
was "informally notified" of U.S.
plans to recognize his regime soon
by Caffery, F.R.'s man-on-the-spot,
in absence of formal diplomatic rep
resentative.
Havana, long awaiting this move,
felt better. Dr. Grau had gone out
principally because he could not se
cure the coveted recognition.
Object of speculation: Did Caf
fery get his dope from Hull in Key
West last week, or more recently
since Hull conferred with F.R., thus
signifying latter's approval.
