# Anderson Returns to Old Form on Diamond
## 
### 
Fast balls nicking the corners,
sharp breaking curves, and fine con
trol yesterday gave notice that Stan
Anderson, ace Card hurler two years
back, is fit and ready for another
successful year on the mound as he
opened up for the first time yester
day in a practice game between
members of the Stanford varsity
baseball squad.
Anderson, who was ineligible last
season; worked three innings witli*-
out allowing a hit. Hs is faster than
in 1932. His control is better and he
pitchod with a confidence which
was previously lacking.
Fred Herringer, veteran right
hander, who will probably share Ihe
brunt of the mound work with An

i derson this year, looked even faster
than last season and has developed
a neat change of pace which will
i.dd to his effectiveness.
Eliot Blanchard, who chucked y
few games for the frosh a year ago,
also displayed his wares in the
workout and proved that he too can
' bear future watching. His sweeping,
| side arm curve had some of the
older heads baffled.
Royal Ivory, , t southpaw transfer
from San Mateo J.C., looked prom
ising, and Lefty Campbell, who
worked some games for the varsity
last season, showed more skill, those
two round out a pitching staff the
strength of which has not been seen
I for years on the Indian campus.
