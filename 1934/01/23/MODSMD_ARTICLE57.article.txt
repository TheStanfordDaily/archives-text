# NEW AIR DEFENSE TO BE SUBJECT OF TALK TOMORROW
## 
### 
The Science Association is pre
senting Captain I. A. Luke in a talk
on "Anti - Aircraft Development
Since the World War" tomorrow
evening aL 8 o'clock. This program
promises to be of great interest not
only because the topic is one of
wide discussion, but ?lso because
there are to be four motion pictures
following th? speech which will
show a complete anti-aircraft regi
ment in action.
That all civilization is doomed if
another war takes place is ridicu
lous, Captain Luke claims. He added
that this prevalent notion is just one
more proof that the general run of
people delight in frightening them
selves over something they know
nothing about.
Much Improvement
Since the World War, our means
of defense against airplane warfare
have been improved tremendously
There has been great development
in the power and maneuvering abil
ity of anti-aircraft guns, particu
larly as to methods of handling. It
is a very rare happening today
when such a gun misses its mark
And when one learns that the gun
must be aimed at a plane moving in
three dimensions and at a speed of
'one hundred and fifty to two hun
! dred miles per hour this accuracy
j is almost unbelievable.
Much improvement has taken
place in the mechanical aids; there
is one highly complicated machine
; a mechanical computer, which sup
-1 plies all the necessary speed and
accuracy of direction required.
Luke Reassures
In winding up his statement, Cap
tain Luke was most reassuring as tc
the future of mankind, at least as
far as methods of warfare are con
cerned; the stress placed upon the
place of poison gas in the next wai
is absurd. Not only is it almost im
possible for a plane to carry a suf
| ficient amount of gas to do mud
or any damage, but the recently
' developed methods of anti-aircrafi
will make it very difficult for any
gas-laden plane to carry out it;
purpose.
Captain Lake will speak at tht
i faculty clubhouse.
