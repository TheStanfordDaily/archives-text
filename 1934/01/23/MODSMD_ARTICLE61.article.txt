to aid in solving the campus phone
problem. Yet to be completed is the
one new inter-hall trunk which will
be finished in the next day or two.

going trunks there are now eight
lines for in-coming and out-going
calls, four for out-going calls only,
and two inter-hall trunks. When

help «ut considerably," remarked

operator. "But I suggest that
people know the room number of
the student they arc calling," he
said, "as that is the chief trouble
with telephone service."
Now that the Bawl-outs are avail
able callers can .find out the room
numbers of students living in the
