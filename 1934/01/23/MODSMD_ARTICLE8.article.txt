# THIRD OF RADIO TALKS IS GIVEN BY DR. T. KREPS
## Employment Surveys Offer No Accurate Figures, Says Professor RAPS N.R.A. HOUR-CUT Present Opportunity For Culture, He Holds 
### Al Honan 
The world must come to a better
appreciation of the possibilities of
cultural development if it is to se
cure relief from the present unem
ployment situation, according to Dr.
Theodore J. Kreps of the Graduate
School of Business, who last night
?,ave the thud talk in the Stanford
series of educational addresses over
radio station KPO.
Professor Kreps stressed the fact
that no really authoritative figures
are availably regarding the aclual
amount of unemployment as the
government makes no check and
any figures given in magazine ar
ticles and newspapers carry a great
deal of personal element. However,
he did state lhat statistics released
by the American Federation of La
bor quoted these amounts: January,
1930, three million; 1931, seven mil
lion; 1932, thirteen million; 1933,
thirteen million; and at present 1 his
figure has dropped to about seven
and a half million unemployed.
Jobless Still Need Jobs
Present prospects for the jobless
are not so good, said Dr. Kreps, be
cause even in the 1929 peak of pro
duction would have to be exceeded
in order to give 40 hours a week to
all men ready and willing to work.
Cutting ihe hours of work seems
to be a good idea at first glance, but
closer examination shows that un
employment would not disappear
then as the increased costs of busi
ness caused by cutting working
hours beyond a certain point would
| tend to make business stagnant. It
is a question whether the hour
cutting done by the N.R.A. already
will not have a harmful effect.
Need New Opportunity
Dr. Kreps added that this situa
tion might be expected to continue
indefinitely unless a' new opportu
nity, such as was given by the ad
vent of the motor car, presents itself,
and this opportunity may come in
the field of artistic pursuits.
The present situation is proving
a challenge and there was never a
better time for great cultural de
velopment, said Dr. Kreps. The im
provement of civic beauty and the
building of educational institutions
would ofTer a golden chance for
more employment.
Next week's .talk, fourth in the
series, will present Dr. Carl L. Als
berg, director of the Food Research
Institute. His topic will be "Pend
ing Food and Drug Legislation in
Congress."
