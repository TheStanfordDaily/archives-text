## Hamlin Garland Sincerely Supports Americanism 
### 
Himself a "Maker of American
Literature," Hamlin Garland spoke
yesterday evening in the Stanford
Assembly Hall about men who "if
not the only makers of American
literature" were at least those whom
he had grown to know and love.
A calm, quiet old man, speaking
with sincerity and great earnestness,
Mr. Garland described his meetings
with such men as William Dean
Howells, James Whitcomb Riley,
Rudyard Kipling, Joaquin Miller,
Walt Whitman, Henry James, and
Francis Bret Harte.
Garland concluded his characteri
zations of the famous with a quiet
sadness: "I stand as their represen
tative—they are old-fashioned, out
of date, but they deserve to be re
membered, once in a while—these
fine old makers of American litera
ture."
Touched, sentimental Stanford
ites stood and clapped until he dis
appeared behind the Hall
curtains. Confronted with a horde
of autograph seekers, Garland hesi
tated. Considerate Mrs. Herbert
Hoover volunteered to lake the
names of those who desired auto
graphs and bore him off to a private
reception.
