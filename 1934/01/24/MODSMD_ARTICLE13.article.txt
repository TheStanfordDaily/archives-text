## Hotel Style Will Feature First Hall Formal 
### 
Setting a standard for following
j years, the initial Union formal
dance will be given in elaborate
style Friday evening, January 26, at
; 9 o'clock. Ideas gleaned from the
| experience of the women transfers
'from other campi have been com
â–  bined to make the affair an out
standing campus function.

Since the dance will be carried
out in hotel style with tables for
couples and groups, both the main
lobby and dining room will be com
bined to provide adequate space.
Garden benches and fountains
among potted cypress and eucalyp
; tus trees will form an artistic back
ground for the formal affair.
A1 Rushton's orchestra playing in
the fire-place end of the lobby will
be assisted by special numbers from
Union Club women. A public ad
dress system will be used to make
1 dancing in both rooms possible.
Committees Announced
Jane Hillebrand, general chairman
;for the affair, is being assisted by a
committee including Nancy Webster,
reservations; Betty Church, finance
and bids; Betty Reynolds, decora
tions; Harriet Hall, refreshments;
Tony Westerman, reception; and
Charlotte Burridge, publicity.
A checkroom under the direction
of Alice and Christine Robinson
will be run by Union women Babe
Dear, Amelia Baei*, and Faith Car
