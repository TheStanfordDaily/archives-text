# FLYING O'S WIN FROM CARDINAL RESERVES 46-23
## Lanky Clubmen Display Fast Brand of Ball In Easy Win 
### Frank Tremaine 
Amidst boos, catcalls, yells, cheers,
and laughter, the Winged "O" cir
cus, better known as the Olympic
Club basketball team, came to the
Farm last night to administer a
sound whipping to Stanford's sec
ond and third-string hoopsters, 46
to 23.
Despite the seeming levity with
which Stanford rooters received
their efforts, the Olympic Club, one
of the country's few unbeaten quin
! tets, put on as smooth an exhibition
of basketball as the Farm has seen
in many a day. Stanford's reserves
i were powerless to stem the tide of
| scores the lanky Clubmen poured
into the bucket.
Reserves Show Talent
Although badly beaten, the sec
j ond stringers showed spots of good
; basketball which must have raised
! Coach John Bunn's hopes for con
ference success several degrees. A1
j Ilershey at center managed to get
I the tip a fair amount of the time,
j even against Lubin, 6-foot 7-inch
j Club center, while Bob Bost and
j Bob Lindsey showed flashes of bril
i liancy.
The Club team was off to a 4-
l point lead before Stanford could
â€¢score when Kintana and Lubin
| dropped in one hand shots. Farber
| put the Indians in the scoring col
umn with a free throw and after
iJKintana and Lubin had counted
j again, Bost rang the bell for Stan
j ford's first field goal.
Lubin, Kintana Star
With Lubin, Kintana, and Knowles
Unking most of the shots, the Olym
! pics piled up 27 points in the first
I half against ihe Cards' 10.
j Lindsey opened the second half
with a one-hand field goal and Her
shey added one point on a free
throw before the Olympics could
j get their attack under way again,
j but once started, they piled up 21
j more points against the Indians' 13.
| Lubin was high point man with 15.
Not as serious minded as most
j Stanford basketball audiences, the
I crowd evidently came to the game
jwith the intention of fully enjoying
Utself. Yells, cheers, and boos
J greeted every attempted shot and
pass while giant Frank Lubin, Club
j center, caused loud laughs as he
! held the ball out of reach of some
| -comparatively diminutive Stanford
| guard. At one time Lubin, Knowles,
land Kintana had the crowd in an
( uproar thny played catch across
| the Stanford basket over the heads
I of most of the Cardinal team.
