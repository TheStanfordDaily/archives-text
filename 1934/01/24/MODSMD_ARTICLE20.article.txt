# Seniors Only Attend Dance
## 
### 
With the announcement of Dance
Chairman Dick Gould last night
that four intrepid and muscular
senior men would be stationed at
the door to recognize their class
mates, the possibility that non
seniors would crash the Class of '34's
,jolly-up tomorrow night was defi
nitely eliminated:
There will be but one exception
to the unavoidable rule that only
senior men and women will be per
mitted to attend the dance. Women
of any class, if escorted by a senior
man, will be allowed entrance.
A contemporaneous prevalent
opinion to the effect that the jolly
up will cost money was smashed
and branded as fallacious by Gould.
"It's free," he said, and then added,
"to seniors."
In order to obtain a sufficiency of
women to alleviate the deplorable
necessity of man dancing with each
other, transportation will be pro
vided for all senior feminine mem
bers of the "800" whose inclination
prefers the company of other women
to an orthodox date.
To be held in the Women's Club
house, the jolly-up will last from 7
to 8 o'clock.

Roble Club women who have
birthdays in January will celebrate
at the dormitory Friday nigh!. The
winter sports >motif will be carried
out.
