# Abolition of Card Stunts Considered
## Committee Seeks Campus Opinion in Discussion 
### Frank Orr 
Question as to the effectiveness of
card stunts as used by Stanford foot
ball rooting sections was raised yes
terday as a group of Rally Commit
tee members prepared to investigate
the prospects of continuing the
stunts next season:
"There is some doubt as to the
attraction that cards is a small root
ing section such as ours give to a
game," said Head Rallyman Stan
Beaubaire yesterday. "Some people
believe that they should be abol
ished entirely, with field stunts and
more yells and songs substituted.
The only trouble with a gr<}up the
size of ours is that there is mote
chance for one or two mistakes to
spoil the effect entirely."
Opinion Asked
"Rally Committee discussion of
the present situation is merly to de
termine the opinion of the campus 1
in general. We believe that card
stunts are an interesting and color
ful part of the spectacle of a large
football game, if they can be car
ried out successfully. Our problem'j
today is to make them more satis- !
factory, if we are to keep them, or
find a better, more entertaining, as
well as effective substitute if they
are to go.
"The Rally Committee is open to
suggestions from the entire campus,
and will be glad to receive them
through the mail or in writing at
the A.S.S.U. offices."
Stunts Criticized
Sections last season approximated
30 by 40 cards in size, Beaubaire ex
plained, and several sports writers 1
have criticized card stunts in gen- !
; oral, urging the adoption of humor
ous field stunts and band antics for
between - the - halves entertainment,
unless rooting section conditions are
| improved.
"We wish to get an expression of
opinion from the students now, while
the football season is still fresh in
1 our minds," Beaubaire said, "and
! determine just what we will do
about it next year."
Trautman Speaks
Student opinion will govern
whether or not the pard stunts are
to be retained, Ihc Rally Committee
decided. A1 Peache, Miriam Kropp,
; A1 Rushton, and B Kellogg compose
, the committee appointed to confer
with B.A.C. officials and ascertain
the-wishes of students as to the sit
uation.
"The only trouble is getting
enough students in the rooting sec
tion," said A.S.S.U. President Jetry
Trautman last night. "If the section
is big enough the cards are much
better than field stunts. I believe
that they are a drawing card for
outside spectators because they add
color to the game. That is one thing
that distinguished intercollegiate
j from professional football."

tion," said A.S.S.U. President Jetry
Trautman last night. "If the section
is big enough the cards are much
better than field stunts. I believe
that they are a drawing card for
outside spectators because they add
color to the game. That is one thing
that distinguished intercollegiate
j from professional football."
Question as to the effectiveness of
card stunts as used by Stanford foot
ball rooting sections was raised yes
terday as a group of Rally Commit
tee members prepared to investigate
the prospects of continuing the
stunts next season:
"There is some doubt as to the
attraction that cards is a small root
ing section such as ours give to a
game," said Head Rallyman Stan
Beaubaire yesterday. "Some people
believe that they should be abol
ished entirely, with field stunts and
more yells and songs substituted.
The only trouble with a gr<}up the
size of ours is that there is mote
chance for one or two mistakes to
spoil the effect entirely."
Opinion Asked
"Rally Committee discussion of
the present situation is merly to de
termine the opinion of the campus 1
in general. We believe that card
stunts are an interesting and color
ful part of the spectacle of a large
football game, if they can be car
ried out successfully. Our problem'j
today is to make them more satis- !
factory, if we are to keep them, or
find a better, more entertaining, as
well as effective substitute if they
are to go.
"The Rally Committee is open to
suggestions from the entire campus,
and will be glad to receive them
through the mail or in writing at
the A.S.S.U. offices."
Stunts Criticized
Sections last season approximated
30 by 40 cards in size, Beaubaire ex
plained, and several sports writers 1
have criticized card stunts in gen- !
; oral, urging the adoption of humor
ous field stunts and band antics for
between - the - halves entertainment,
unless rooting section conditions are
| improved.
"We wish to get an expression of
opinion from the students now, while
the football season is still fresh in
1 our minds," Beaubaire said, "and
! determine just what we will do
about it next year."
Trautman Speaks
Student opinion will govern
whether or not the pard stunts are
to be retained, Ihc Rally Committee
decided. A1 Peache, Miriam Kropp,
; A1 Rushton, and B Kellogg compose
, the committee appointed to confer
with B.A.C. officials and ascertain
the-wishes of students as to the sit
uation.
"The only trouble is getting
enough students in the rooting sec
tion," said A.S.S.U. President Jetry
Trautman last night. "If the section
is big enough the cards are much
better than field stunts. I believe
that they are a drawing card for
outside spectators because they add
