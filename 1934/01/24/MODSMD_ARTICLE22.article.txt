# Two Stanfordites Tell Of Cinema World Life
## 
### FRANCES AYRES 
"Going Hollywood" may be ac
complished by acting, crooning, or
winning a home town beauty con
test, but two Stanford coeds, Alice
Klauber and Carrie Richter, owe
their break in the cinematic world
to their ability to row. Proficiency
in this sport, gained perhaps, on the
murky waters of Lagunita, won
them exciting jobs as extras in
"Eight Girls in a Boat," recent at
traction at a local theatre.
They were two of eleven girls,
chosen this summer from a San Di
ego rowing club, to double for the
young heroines of the picture who
did not number rowing among their
accomplishments.
It was exciting work—two weeks
at Lake Arrowhead where the film
was on location—glimpses behind
the scenes of glamourous Hollywood
at the Paramount studios —and first
hand knowledge of what movie life
is really like.
But it is also hard work. "We
usually started at 5:30 o'clock in (he

I morning and worked until dinner
time. Re-takes? Why, sometimes
! we worked all day on just one scene
and then had to do it again the next
morning because the lighting was
i „
I wrong.
The Stanford girls were impressed
with the lavishness of movie life.
"It seemed as if there was a great
deal of waste. It cost the company
$5,000 a week to keep the cast at
Lake Arrowhead, yet half of them
had nothing to do most of the time.
Carpenters, stenographers, and tech
nical workmen got wages far out of
proportion to anything they would
receive in any other business."
While Alice and Carrie were vis
iting the Paramount studios in Hol
lywood they had a make-up test at
the same time Jean Rouverol, who
j entered Stanford this quarter, was
having one. Jean was cast for the
lead in "Eight Girls in a Boat but
left to appear in her mother's play,
1 "Growing Pains." which opened on
Broadway last fall
