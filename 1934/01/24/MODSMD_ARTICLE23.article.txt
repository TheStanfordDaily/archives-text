# Discrepancy Cause Of Delay in Grid Manager Selection
## Irregularities in Ratings Of Junior Managers Cause Comment SMITH, HAMPTON LEAD Committee to Have Public Address System Built 
### 
Apparent discrepancies in reports
used in rating men for the senior
managership caused the recom
mended appointment of Jess Smilh
as football manager to be again laid
on the table at last night's Exec
utive Committee meeting.
Reports that some junior man
agers, now in line for the senior job,
were given ratings for days when
they did not attend practice, occa
sioned comment, resulted in the rec
ommendation that sophomore, jun
ior, and senior managers be sum
moned and records submitted at
next week's meeting. The appoint
ment was tabled during the execu
tive session last week.

Smith, who with Gordon Hamp
ton leads the field of six junior
managers in the race for next year's
senior position, was recommended
for the post by the committee for
that purpose, including Coach Tiny
Thornhill and Manager Bob Saxe.
Definite action on the appointment
will be taken after the Ex Com
mittee has seen evidence and heard
cases pertaining to 'the records by
which Saxe and an office manager
rated the work of junior managers.
Public Address System
Plans for a public address system
to be financed from the A.S.S.U.
surplus and built in Stanford's elec
trical engineering laboratories were
submitted and passed. A trophy
case, possibly to be installed in the
Union cellar, is also being consid
ered as a plan to be financed.
Five minutes under way, the
meeting was halted by the familiar
! sound of rending metal us two ears
outside smashed fenders. Proceed
i ings were resumed after Committee
1 members had crowded windows to
i watch discussion following.
Wire Indian
A wire frame in the shape of an
Indian, once covered with flowers
and used in the New Year's Rose
iParade in Pasadena, will be shipped
here for cost of transportation, a
[ letter to tho committee said. The
â€¢recommendation was passed that the
figure be sent to Stanford, possibly
' for use in rally programs.
"Pop" Warner's suggestion, voiced
in a letter, that Bob O'Connor br
awarded an exception award for
i football during the 1932 season, wa;;
| voted down.
Quarterly financial reports from
j student managers of activities were
read in part by Manager Habies,
with most enterprises and publica
tions in favorable condition as com
puted with last year's figures.
