# IT'S THE GRAPHS AGAIN

There was a lime vvlicn everybody was printing graphs.
1 hose were the big boom (lavs of colored bath-tubs. After
the "(it) days" Hull Market hangover had developed into a
depression of "world-wide" proportions, few had the cour
age to print graphs and fewer the stamina to read them.
Hut now that hope is in the air, and the graphs have
turned their pretty heads upward across the squared page,
thev are out again. The Daily has just received a very
pretty one from a business house that was noted during
the deepest days of depression for attempting to mcta
morphize "Keep Smiling" into an economic panacea.
We expected the best from their graph, and maybe we
got the best; but what a shock.
Things are getting better. That seems clear; but clear
tilings are not always very uplifting. Take distilled water
for an example!
Thus economically we are I per cent over last year at
this time but still .'{() per cent below normal —which no one
used to think was very, exciting. And we arc a full 50 per
cent below the gay peak of 1!)28.
Then there is the New Deal; we have spent; we have
inflated; we have codified; we have had war scares —
everything and the gain since last Mareli is no more than
It per cent. Of course, that is fine. Eleven is better than
nothing; but nothing isn't very good. Eleven per cent gain
is better than a loss; but a loss is even worse than nothing.
So it is very clear, that things are not what they used to be.
Figures are a bit baffling, and never very accurate. Hut
one thing seems evident. Either we will get used to some
thing much less than what we used to think was normal;
or something is going to happen.
What is going to happen is a matter of speculation.
That something must happen is certain. The intelligent
thing is to choose what is going to happen. The natural
thing is to wait and see what will happen.
We are waiting. We hope that Roosevelt is selecting.
