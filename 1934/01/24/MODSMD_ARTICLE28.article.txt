Palo Alto traffic. regulations being what (hoy are, there
is nothing to <lo about it.
We have learned, however, that there are two zones
that are particularly obnoxious (i.e., frequented by guard
ians of the law practically "without end: first, University
Avenue past Middlelield Road; second, Stanford Avenue
just behind liranner. This is advice. Half of it we learned
:il a bitter price. May it case someone's path.
And while on the tratlic question, another zone of
(rouble growing more acute as the days go by is the Hav
shore Highway. After killing about 150 men a year on this
road, people woke up to Hie fact that the highway was
beginning to look like the second half of the first Marne
offensive.
Reinforcements were rushed in, and speeding and
third-lane driving have not only their natural hazards but
tlie additional ones of a police force embittered toward
"these crazy college drivers," and anyone from a campus
is immediately a crazy driver.
The moral aspects of speeding are the student's own
business and to lecture on the evils of fast driving: gray
hairs, weak heart, and burned out brakes in (JO days, is
not our concern.
Our message is simply one of self-preservation. The
anti-speeding campaign is closing in around us, Palo Alto
from the south and the Ravshorc from points north. We
can stand firm and pay fines. We can slow np and pay no
fines.
It's an individual funeral as far as we are concerned,
but a sad one nevertheless.
