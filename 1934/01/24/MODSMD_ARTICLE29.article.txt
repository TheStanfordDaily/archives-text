# War Clouds Fill the Sky
## 
### 
We sec by the newspapers that war is ])raelicallv a
sure thiPublications all over the country are filled with
articles (Hearst's San Francisco Examiner had eight in
one issue) which by their tone accept war with Japan as
a certainty.
There are several possible explanations for (his sudden
epidemic of war rumors. One is that President Roosevelt
has secretly started them, under the theory that a war is
the only thing that will bring America out of the depres
sion. There is no proof of this. Another possibility is that
a scarcity of news has caused the newspapers to fabricate
the whole thing as a means of filling their front pages.
Considering the crowded events of the past weeks, this
Iheory hardly seems likely.
The true source of the war-inciting articles, we believe,
is the armament manufacturers. Through the bribery of
government officials, the control of news sources, and the
spreading of false reports regarding the war aims of vari
ous countries, the armament manufacturers expect to
arouse the fears of the patriots and the hopes of the mili
larists. The result is at least preparation for war if not
war itself either way it is highly profitable to the dealers
in destruction.
