TIIE EMPEROR JONES (Krimsky-Cochran; United Artists release)

Nov/ that the original script of this !
O'Neill play has undergone revision
for grand opera as well as for the
cinema, the only hope which re
mains for the estimation of its true i
vigor and power seems to lie in a
possible revival of the aforemen- j
tioned original script.
The opera, disregarding its quali
ties as an experiment and its musi
cal virtues (which remain the sub- j
ject of considerable debate of which
I confess myself incapable of re
butting) loses the tremendous ani- .
mal force of the play by its slow
ness of pace as well as by the lack
of imagination and unwillingness to
betray fixed convention which char
acterize the staging of opera in gen
eral.
Further, the difficulty to an audi
ence of accustoming itself to so rad
ically modified a type of opera- ham
pers immediate appreciation of it as (
opera as much as the methods of j
opera hamper the script itself. The j
difficulty here is almost too great j
for any reconciliation.
As to ihe picture: it would seem |
that by its nature the cinema, elim- j
mating even the brief intermissions j
which a stage production demands,
would be capable of building greater
force and making its climax even
more terrifying than that of the play 1
on the stage.
Eut the picture failed to do either
of these things although the horrid !
terror of the emperor as he fled j
through the jungle, possessed the !
greatest—if the only—power to be !
found in the film. There are, it i
seems, two explanations for this. In j
the first place, the play itself al
most demands the view of an ac- j
tual, terrorized suffering human
being. This the films can only stim- 1
ulate. The actuality of flesh and
blood cannot, in this ease at least, I
be equalled by the best that pho- j
tography can offer.
Further, such a play demands i
great skill in staging; and the mod- !
ification of the play which stressed
rather than implied Jones' earlier ;
life and included such a tasteless I
comedy scene as that of the over- |
splendid court in obeisance before j
the Emperor, lacked that skill.
This same scene may serve as an
illustration of the film's shortcom
ings. It destroyed the highly im- j
portant matter of the barbarity of
these people and hence made their 1

retreat to the hills a strain to an
imagination which had seen them
bowing in all their finery before the
splendid throne. It introduced lov?
comedy where the only comedy
O'Neill himself inserted was a faint,
ironic glimmer.
What the film might have gained
by better treatment we may only
guess; as it stands, the film is an at
tempt to produce a fine—however
limited—play, which fails through
lack of wise adherence to the script
in letter as well as spirit. —Sandoe
