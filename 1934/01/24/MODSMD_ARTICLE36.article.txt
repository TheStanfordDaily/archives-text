# PROMINENT GERMAN REFUGEE ADDED TO STANFORD FACULTY
## 
### 
i Stanford is to share in the Hitler
j imposed scattering of G e r m a n
[scholars. On April 1 Felix Bloch, a
J "Hitler - refugee" of first rank,
I known in the world of science as
one of the best of the younger phy
! sicists in Germany, is to join the i
' University faculty as acting asso
j ciate professor of physics. His ap
pointment for a period of two years
I is made possible by the Rockefeller
Foundation and the Emergency
I Committee in Aid of Displaced Ger
man Scholars.
President Wilbur yesterday re-
I ceived Professor Bloch's acceptance
| of his appointment from Rome,
j where he is at present a Fellow of
j the Rockefeller Foundation in the
! Institute di Fisica dell'Universita.
Ph.D. in 1928
| After receiving his Ph.D. degree
i at Leipzig in 1928, Bloch was as
j sistant in theoretic physics at Zu
rich for a year, then Fellow of the
Lorentz Foundation in Utrecht from
1929 to 1930. He returned to Leip
zig in 1930 for a year as assistant
j in theoretic physics, spent the next
year as a fellow of the Orsted Foun
j dation in Copenhagen, and was
| again in Leipzig at the time when
; the Hitler order drove him to Rome,
i Professor David Locke Webster,
head of Stanford's Physics Depart
ment, expressed great satisfaction
I over Bloch's coming. "His specialty
is the mathematical aspects of mod
: em physics. With him on our staff
; it will be possible for the depart
j ment to expand courses offered to
: students of advanced theoretical
I physics."
To Help Advanced Students
"Physics being a basic require
ment for all who are preparing for
the many professions including en
gineering and medicine," continued
Webster, "we have had to concen
-1 trate our efforts on the mox-e ele
' mentary courses, allowing the In
! dependent Study Plan to take care
' of a large part " of the advanced
work. Thus a good opportunity to
j expand the advanced courses, with
j out robbing the elementary, is most
, welcome."'
j Professor Bloch will also teach ?n

summer quarter this year, giving an
added inducement to graduate stu
dents in this field to take advantage
of his presence in the United States.
