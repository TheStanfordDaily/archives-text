# CARD RUGGERS MAY PLAY CAMBRIDGE AT NEW YORK
## 
### 
A transcontinental trip to New
York with an international rugby
match with Cambridge University
as the incentive, became a possibil
ity for the Stanford club yesterday.
Harry Maloney, president of the
Northern California Union, has re
ceived a letter from New York rug
ger backers proposing the game and
explaining plans.
The only hitch to the program is
the fact that the game would neces
sarily take place in April, and would
require the Stanford men to be ab
sent from school for a period of ten
days or more.
With the proposal of a Cambridge
game in their hands, the Stanford
team now has lour tentative trips
to consider. They are (a) series of
games in Australia to be played
this summer; (b) series in New Zea
land for this summer; (c) journey
to Japan for a series there which
would also take place this summer;
(d) New York trip to meet Cam
bridge in April.
On top of this Stanford is almost
a certainty to travel to Los Angeles
this spring for rugger matches in
that vicinity. British Columbia is
sending a representative team here
in March and Harvard is talking of
sending a team here in the near fu
ture. So the Indians' chances of
edging in on a good trip somewhere
soon are exceptionally good.
The invitation to compete with
Cambridge in New York|has evolved
from the series of international
matches which are to be played
there this spring. Cambridge has al
ready signed to appear in the East

' for a ten-day tour and series of
jkaines.
The famous "Light Blues," con
querors of Oxford this year, will
play Harvard April 7 in either New
York or Boston, and will follow up
with Yale at New Haven, Princeton
; at Princeton and a combined East
ern team in New York April 14.
The trip would be a self-paying
one, if undertaken, as the New
i Yorkers have assured enough games
Ito cover any deficit if one should
remain after the Cambridge series
was over. A Cambridge-Harvard,
;or Stanford-Cambridge would have
i a tremendous drawing power in the
metropolitan area.
For the present, the Stanford team
lis resolutely attending to business,
; with an eye to San Francisco Uni
' versity, who will be playing here
this Saturday.
The Dons feature several of their
American football stars, particularly
I Don McStoclcer, who worked in
their backfield last week. S.F.U.
played the Barbarians to a stand
| still for three-fourths of the game
until in the last few minutes the
Barbs shoved over two lucky trys
j and converted to win, 10-0.
i Stanford will be without Bill Sim,
whose slashing play was a big J'ac
! tor in their 21-0 victory last week;
Sim has an injured ankle sustained
on one of his scoring rambles against
, the Blues.
The remainder of the first-string
! fifteen is intact, however, and Donn
, Tatum, an experienced and heavy
! scrum man, has reported for duty
i this week and will be available if
I needed in the second rank Saturday.
