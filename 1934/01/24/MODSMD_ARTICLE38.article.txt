## 
### 
The answer to the question, "What
do football men do after the season
is over?" is seen in the list of en
tries for the all-University Boxing
Tournament, to be held late this
month. Wes Muller, star center, has
already registered for the glove
slinging contest, while Bill Sim,
Monk Moscrip, and others are ex
pected to turn in their names within
the next few days, giving the fans
a chance to see them in an entirely
different role.
Dates for the tournament have
been announced as January 29 for
the preliminaries and February 1
for the finals, held in conjunction
with finals of the wrestling tourna
ment. Coach Harry Maloney hopes
that the tournament will uncover
some new material 'for the team,
which is to meet California in two
matches in addition to several other
prospective meets which are as yet
not scheduled.
The first California match is to be
held February 16 at Cal and the
second is to be held on the Farm
March 2. Coach Maloney is trying
to arrange two matches with U.C.
L.A. and the California Aggies to
add to the schedule.
Some of the men already signed
up for the tournament are Muller
and Mitchell, heavyweights; John
Fowler, light - heavyweight; Bob
Moore, junior light - heavy weight;
Waldo Munday, middleweight; Bill
Sullivan and Ben Cave, welter
weight; John Huston and Cabby Ca
beilero, featherweight. Popular
opinion nominates the battle be
tween Sullivan and Cave as the best
fight of the tournament.
All men interested in boxing are
invited to register for the matches,
according to Coaches Harry Ma
loney and Myron Schall, as the box
ing team is short of material, and
many of the men showing promise
in the tournament will be given a
chance to make the team.
