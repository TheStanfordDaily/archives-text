Tiny Mable Stark, probably the world's foremost feminine animal
trainer, announces each year at the end of a strenuous season
her days as a trainer are over. But when spring; rolls around and the
circus prepares to hit the sawdust trail, Mable is buck again with her
snarling, fighting troupe of lions and tigers. Pictured here is Mable
with her favorite, Rajah, 250-pound Bengal tiger, still game lor
\ another season.
