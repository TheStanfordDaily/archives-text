# AIR SQUADRON DROPS ON FARM FOR NIGHT
## 
### 
Paying a visit to the campus for
their monthly overnight "march," 14
officers and 12 enlisted men of the
91st observation squadron, stationed
at Crissy Feld, San Francisco, last
night encamped around a roaring
bonfire near the highway polo field.
Major D. P. Mews, in command of
the squadron, explained thatrin time
of war part of his command would
operate out of Palo Alto in view of
the probability thai, regular army
fields would be heavily bombed. The
rest of the squadron would operate
from other dispersed air fields.
The detachment now encamped
were brought down yesterday from
San Francisco in seven planes, six
of which made two trips, and they
will return today. Supplies were
trucked down hince Crissy Field
was too wet to permit a transport
plane to take off in safety.
