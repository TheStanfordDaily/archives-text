# FROSH HOOP MEN DOWN COMMERCE HIGH TEAM, 38-18
## 
### 
Good if somewhat inconsistent
basketball by Jimmy Bradshaw's
hoop machine earned the Stanford
frosh a 38 to 13 win over Commerce
High of San Francisco last night
preliminary 10 the game in
the Pavilion.
The Babes gained an overwhelm
ing point victory not because their
forward line was playing good bas
ketball, although tallied on a good
percentage of their long shots, but
because they played smarter, faster
basketball. Ten of the Indians' 17
field goals were made on- push-in
or set-up shots which found the
Commerce defense out of the play.
Quade Stores Iligu
Bill Quade led the frosh in scor
ing with 14 points, closely followed
by Howell Turner who accounted
for 11 digits on the other side of
the board. Angelo made 7 of Com
merce's points to lead the city Learn.
After finding that the Commerce
quintet was out to win, having
grabbed a 4-1 lead in the opening
minutes, the Stanford frosh stalled
clicking. Quade, Turner, and Moore
found the guards a weak spot in
the Commerce defense and began
racing rn set-ups. At half time 'he
Cards left the floor with a 14-4 lead.
The last two periods were a repe
tition of the first, with Stanford
steadily drawing away. Beedle broke
into the scoring column by tallying
twice under the bucket and swish
ing a third from the horn.
Moore Flashy
Moore continued playing one of
the flashiest offensive games at guard
seen in the Pavilion this season.
Three times he raced through Com
merce defense at top speed to put
the ball .through the hoop.
While scoring 24 points in the sec
ond half the Babes sparkled at one
moment and looked dull the next.
Their passing was generally hap
hazard, sometimes connecting but
often rolling out or going to Com
merce. Defense work under the
bucket was feeble at times, for the
high school boys regularly grabbed
the ball off the backboard in spite
of their .smaller size.
Reserves Play
With the ball game already sewed
up, "Bradshaw turned most of the
final period over to the reserves.
Williamson, Huff, Proctor, Smith,
Dillon, Howard, and Duncan saw
action.
Frosh practice now points to Fri
day night's tussle with the St.
Mary's frosh, which promises to be
one of the closest, games the frosh
will enter during the 1934 season.
The Moraga Valley boys will come
to the Farm with a high-scoring
reputation, but their 43 to 17 win
over the California frosh Monday
night leaves the Papooses with a
4-point margin by compartive scores.

Their passing was generally hap
hazard, sometimes connecting but
often rolling out or going to Com

Reserves Play
With the ball game already sewed
up, "Bradshaw turned most of the
final period over to the reserves.
Williamson, Huff, Proctor, Smith,
Dillon, Howard, and Duncan saw
action.
Frosh practice now points to Fri
day night's tussle with the St.
Mary's frosh, which promises to be
one of the closest, games the frosh
will enter during the 1934 season.
The Moraga Valley boys will come
to the Farm with a high-scoring
reputation, but their 43 to 17 win
over the California frosh Monday
night leaves the Papooses with a
4-point margin by compartive scores.
Good if somewhat inconsistent
basketball by Jimmy Bradshaw's
hoop machine earned the Stanford
frosh a 38 to 13 win over Commerce
High of San Francisco last night
preliminary 10 the game in
the Pavilion.
The Babes gained an overwhelm
ing point victory not because their
forward line was playing good bas
ketball, although tallied on a good
percentage of their long shots, but
because they played smarter, faster
basketball. Ten of the Indians' 17
field goals were made on- push-in
or set-up shots which found the
Commerce defense out of the play.
Quade Stores Iligu
Bill Quade led the frosh in scor
ing with 14 points, closely followed
by Howell Turner who accounted
for 11 digits on the other side of
the board. Angelo made 7 of Com
merce's points to lead the city Learn.
After finding that the Commerce
quintet was out to win, having
grabbed a 4-1 lead in the opening
minutes, the Stanford frosh stalled
clicking. Quade, Turner, and Moore
found the guards a weak spot in
the Commerce defense and began
racing rn set-ups. At half time 'he
Cards left the floor with a 14-4 lead.
The last two periods were a repe
tition of the first, with Stanford
steadily drawing away. Beedle broke
into the scoring column by tallying
twice under the bucket and swish
ing a third from the horn.
Moore Flashy
Moore continued playing one of
the flashiest offensive games at guard
seen in the Pavilion this season.
Three times he raced through Com
merce defense at top speed to put
the ball .through the hoop.
While scoring 24 points in the sec
ond half the Babes sparkled at one
