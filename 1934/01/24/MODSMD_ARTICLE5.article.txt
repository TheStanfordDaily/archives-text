# Alphabetical Graft
## 
### 
F.R. is now preparing to caiTy the
fight into the enemy camp, yester
day invested PWA Ickes with blan
ket authority to eliminate graft (or
try to). Johnson of the NRA ex
pressed "surprise" that he had not
already been asked to explain his
part of the alphabetical soup to a
congressional committee. (Yester
day Senator Nye branded NRA as
"crucifying" the small business
man.)
Meanwhile Roosevelt figured that
CWA workers could quit by May 1,
then enter private work. This, just
us CWA graft complaints turned
over to justice department.
