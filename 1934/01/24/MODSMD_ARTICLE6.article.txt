# Not so Militant
## 
### 
Following many statements by
Japanese cabinet members to the
Imperial Diet, foreign correspond
ents were able to cable home that
an anti-militaristic swing is in
progress.
Foreign Minister Hiorta pled for
peace and understanding. Count
Futiara, House of Peers member,
scored government for permitting
publication of inflammatory articles.
Quoth he: "True Samurai spirit
seeks to prevail without fighting."
