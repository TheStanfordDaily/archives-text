# Farm Heads To Promote Aid Project
## Funds from Rugby Games Will Help Students 
### 
With the appointment of North j
Baker as the' chairman of the Stu- '
dent Relief Committee by A.S.S.U. j
President Gerald Trautman, Stan- j
ford's winter campaign to help stu- j
dents in need of financial assistance !
gets under way.
In one day the committee has |
been in existence, it has sue- j
cccded in securing permission to j
charge 25 cents for Saturday's
rugby gamy with S.F.U., the pro- |
ceeds to be devoted to the student
aid fund.
Campus dances for student relief, j
and future rugby contests may be j
used to raise needed funds.
Methods of administering funds J
will probably be carried on along
the same plan as last year, when
Comptroller Almon E. Roth was
chairman of a committee composed
of A. L. Trowbridge, Mrs. T. A.
Storey, O. H. Blackman, campus
residents appointed by President
Wilbur, who handled the funds as a
community affair.
Money collected was loaned out
to students who needed emer- j
gency financial assistance on a ;
non-interest-bearing basis, until j
maturity of the notes.
Roth points out that winter is the
season when most students need aid,
since they are able to get through
autumn quarter, but their money
supply runs out after Christmas. He
states: "There is a great need for
aid. There is nothing for fellows to
do when they get out of collage;
so it is best for them to stay in
school now when they can.
