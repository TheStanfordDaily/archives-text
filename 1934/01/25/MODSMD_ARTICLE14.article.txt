### FRANCES AYRES 
Fate, not vocational guidance
tests, holds I lie sccret of the future
for college students, believes Dasha,
Gypsy mystic, now telling fortunes
on the campus.
One's career, marriage, and char
acter arc in the story that is writ
ten in the lines of the palm, the
seer claims. She is especially inter
ested in telling the fortunes of
young people of college age, and
comes here after visiting tho Uni
versity of California, U.C.L.A., and
U.S.C., in the south.
"Older people," said she, "are only
interested in making money and de
sire to know most of all how to
make safe investments. Young
people, both boys and girls, are ro
mantic. Their whole lives lie before
them, and foreseeing how love and
business success will come to them
is fascinating."
Slim, smartly dressed, and mod
ern, Dasho's only suggestions of her
Gypsy ancestors are in her dark

coloring and her wanderlust. She
was born in Georgia, that tiny Eu
ropean country whose principal re
cent product has been the Brothers
MdiVani, and has traveled exten
sively in Europe and Asia.
From her recent visits to various
college campi, Dasha has collected
an autograph book of the signatures
of sorority house presidents. There
is a sole male contribution from a
U.C. Delta Chi which reads:
"Well. I found out I wouldn't be
come President. She sure hit the
nail on the head."
Dasha doesn't usually hold read
ings in fraternities, as !ihe finds the
boys a "bit overwhelming," but she
considers college men as interested
in fortune telling as the coeds.
Her creed is never to tell of any
terrible catastrophe or misfortune
that the* palms or cards may reveal
Her philosophy is, "Most people
want their fortunes tolel in order tc
have something confirmed that ihej
already believe."
