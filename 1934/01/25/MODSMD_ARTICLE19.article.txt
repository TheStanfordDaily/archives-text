## Chairman Forced to Cut Speeches from Floor 
### 
Meandering, philosophical Mat
i thew Evans encountered sharp, in
eisive Austin Fife last night at
Public Forum's first session of the
quarter. Following the speeches of
the L.I.D. leader and debater, 20
minutes of heated discussion on and
| off the point at issue were allowed
by a vigilant chairman, who was j
i forced to cut floor speeches short j
(despite.the clamor to be heard.
. Throughout both radical Evans's I
i and conservative Fife's speeches up
holding aftd condemning commu- j
i nism and capitalism, the audience
' continually interrupted to "call" the
speakers on embarrassing points.
Poor, helpless orators had to
appeal to the chairman to rescue
them from sabotage by the au
! dience in order'that they might
stick to the point and finish their
j speeches.
! True to the Daily's predictions,
| the question took the form of com
munism versus capitalism, though it
was stated in terms of redistribution
'of wealth. This took a few mem
' bers of the audience by surprise,
with the result that both questions
were discussed by the audience and
a vote at the end of the session was
considered inexperienced and mean
ingless.
Not a few communists from Palo
Alto lent, their presence and con
tributed ideas to the discussion, as
well as debaters (chiefly cham
pioned by law student Frank Full
enwider) and campus citizenry in
general.
