# Ground Defense Against Bombers Improved, Luke
## 
### 
Speaking before the Science Club
in the Faculty Clubhouse last night,
Captain I. A. Luke of the Military
Science Department outlined to an
interested audience Ihe develop
ments in anti-aircraft defense since
ihe world war.
Illustrating his lecture with slides
,*nd four reels of motion pictures,
Captain Luke told of Ihe research
in mechanical computers for auto
matically aiming the guns which has
made possible a much greater per
cent age of hits, than was possible
in the last war and in his opinion
the ground defense has the odds in
its favor in case of an attack by
bombers from the air.
U.S.C. has had more men on all-
American board teams than any
other college.
