# Wilbur Speaks On Choice of Major Subject
## Advises Students Against Studying Medicine 
### 
Talking before approximately 150
lower division students, Dr. Ray Ly
man Wilbur spoke in the Assembly
Hall last night on the dual subject
of "Factors to Consider in Choosing
a Major, and Illustrations from the
School of Medicine."
With his ever-present humor,
combined with the seasoned ex
perience of 25 years in university
work, Dr. Wilbur presented his
views of training for a vocation.
"We must all learn to maintain
ourselves. We must think of having
something io offer that society will
pay for," Dr. Wilbur stressed as he
explained ihat the general problem
was for the student to find some
thing that he can do and likes to do.
In speaking of the profession of
medicine he advised that the stu
dent not go into that field unless he
really likes it.
Many Activities
Medicine offers a large range of
activities after the course of study
is finished, Dr. Wilbur said, in con
sidering the possible specialization
in the field. He gave examples rang
ing from Ihe general practitioner to
the neurologist and specialist in
public health.
Tine student should have a rea
sonably good mind in order to get
through the medical course where'
so much memorizing is necessary, he
said, but answering a question from
the floor explained that there are
today a number of successful doc
tors who did not have a high schol
astic standing.
