# Blueprint Drawing Of New Dormitory Almost Completed
## Actual Construction Work Under Supervision Of Bakewell, Brown MONOTONY IS AVOIDED Architectural Scheme Will Follow Modern Form 
### 
Blueprint., for ihe new dormitory,
which will -boost housing accommo
dations for Stanford women to the
1,000 mark, are receiving finishing
touches at the hands of architects
Bakewell end Brown, Dean Mary
Yost revealed yesterday. Actual
work on ihe structure will begin
when construction details are com
pleted.
With architectural monotony era
dicated through the use of broken
lines, outside staircases, porches,
terraces, and arcades, the dormitory
promises no resemblance to the old
type institutional building. It will
be similar to Toyon Hall and the
Women's Gymnasium.
Extending to the edge of tlic
Lagunita on the south, almost to
Governor's Lane on the west, and
to a point in line with the eastern
side of tlie Women's Gymnasium,
the building's main entrance will
face on Santa Teresa.
Four connected yet distinct units,
each opening on the large, T-shaped
courtyard, comprise the. general
plan. The front of the building, also
opening on the court and joined to
the dormitory units by corridors,
will contain the central lobby, of
fices, and package rooms.
Two Dining Rooms
Extending over half the length of
the court, on either side will be the
two front dormitory units. Con
nected to them by corridors will be
the two end units. These are planned
in an L-shape, continuing onto the
west side of the court, where they
will open into the two dining rooms.
Kitchens are placed to the rear of
the dining quarters.
In order to carry out the plan of
the small living group within the
large, the four units are being made
as separate and distinct as possible.
Buildings Connected
Arcades end corridors will con
nect them, but each will have its
own reception hall, a separate, one
and one-half story building attached
to the living unit by a corridor and
opening on the court. The recep
tion halls lor the two front units
will be alike in structure, each in
eluding a spacious living room,
smaller reception room, smoking
room, kitchenette, book room, and
glassed-in porch.
Each of the reception halls for the
use of the two end units will have
a part of the main living room raised
a few step.s above the floor level so
that it may be utilized as a stage.
Porches v/ill adjoin all four of the
reception halls.
In addition to the living rooms
of the four units, the central
lobby and the dining rooms will
he used tor social activities. The
dining rooms can he transformed
into one large room for meetings
and dances. Its terraccs facing the
court make it especially attractive
for the latter purpose.
Sophomore, junior, and senior
women will occupy the dormitory
when it opens next October. Pref
erence will be given old women,
with some rooms reserved for en
tering college transfers. Hoble will
I remain the freshman stronghold.
