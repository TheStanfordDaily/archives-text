# AROUND THE CORNER . . . ?

### 
Aii Assistant Secretary of War talked about "economic
storm troops"; he mentioned the Veterans, the Army, the
( and relief workers in one breath. Some'professors,
including Stanford's Mnline, became irate.
I hev wrote the President about unveiled hints at Nazi
dictatorship. Some simple souls will laugh at those pro
fessors; but their laugh will very likely he drowned by the
blare of drums and the billowing of Fascist banners.
Mefore the Depression had graduated from the vaude
ville stage, Lincoln SteH'ens spoke of the certainty of Fas
cism in America. We all laughed. Xow, the situation has
so advanced, that some who speak of constitutional rights
as things as unchanging as the stars, feel that StefTens'
prophecy has already arrived. That is probably not true
the blubberings of some Republicans to the contrary not
withstanding.
* * :|t
Hut that Fascism will come seems fairly certain. It all
depends on whether the Xew Deal can add about T>o pie
lure cards to the deck and hand out grand slam hands to
capital, labor, consumer, and government job-holders as
well. Some feel that is impossible. Some feel that no one
will be holding anything but deuces before the night is
over.
Should America suddenly discover that it's deuces for
all, we probably will see Fascism in the land of the free
and the home of the Constitutional fathers.
Of course, it won't be called Fascism. That smells like
a foreigner washing down a plate of spaghetti with a glass
of beer. We will very likely call it "Americanism." True
Americanism, perhaps. "J"he very fact that we name it
Americanism rather than Fascism makes its possibility
seem that much nearer. Renaming roses does change their
odor.
Whether Roosevelt will be the one to lead this change
is not so clear. He is probably 100 closely wedded to the.
democratic jargon to break loose into an outspoken and
frank dictatorship.
"What about Our historical rights?" will murmur some.
Hut they will only murmur. Liberty will exist, of course,
but we will be told that liberty must be directed toward
tiie good of America. Those whose liberty does not ex
press itself as the Dictator desires, will either be silent,
dead, or change their concept of liberty.
Who worried about liberty during the War? The ma
jority felt no restraint imposed upon them during that
period. The same is the case in Fascism*. No one is op
pressed but the minority and they simply don't count. The
Storm Troopers in (iermany do not feel any restraint on
their liberty; neither do the Rlack Shirts in Italy. Neither
will the majority in America.
Tiie beat-the-drum and wave-lhe-flag elements in our
country today will lead this move toward Fascism. It is a
bit difficult to forecast the color of our shirts, even harder
the color of our shorts under this new system. Hut that it
is coming seems certain.

I hev wrote the President about unveiled hints at Nazi
dictatorship. Some simple souls will laugh at those pro
fessors; but their laugh will very likely he drowned by the
blare of drums and the billowing of Fascist banners.
Mefore the Depression had graduated from the vaude
ville stage, Lincoln SteH'ens spoke of the certainty of Fas
cism in America. We all laughed. Xow, the situation has
so advanced, that some who speak of constitutional rights
as things as unchanging as the stars, feel that StefTens'
prophecy has already arrived. That is probably not true
the blubberings of some Republicans to the contrary not
withstanding.

Hut that Fascism will come seems fairly certain. It all
depends on whether the Xew Deal can add about T>o pie
lure cards to the deck and hand out grand slam hands to
capital, labor, consumer, and government job-holders as
well. Some feel that is impossible. Some feel that no one
will be holding anything but deuces before the night is
over.
Should America suddenly discover that it's deuces for
all, we probably will see Fascism in the land of the free
and the home of the Constitutional fathers.
Of course, it won't be called Fascism. That smells like
a foreigner washing down a plate of spaghetti with a glass
of beer. We will very likely call it "Americanism." True
Americanism, perhaps. "J"he very fact that we name it
Americanism rather than Fascism makes its possibility
seem that much nearer. Renaming roses does change their
odor.
Whether Roosevelt will be the one to lead this change
is not so clear. He is probably 100 closely wedded to the.
democratic jargon to break loose into an outspoken and
frank dictatorship.
"What about Our historical rights?" will murmur some.
Hut they will only murmur. Liberty will exist, of course,
but we will be told that liberty must be directed toward
tiie good of America. Those whose liberty does not ex
press itself as the Dictator desires, will either be silent,
dead, or change their concept of liberty.
Who worried about liberty during the War? The ma
jority felt no restraint imposed upon them during that
period. The same is the case in Fascism*. No one is op
pressed but the minority and they simply don't count. The
Storm Troopers in (iermany do not feel any restraint on
their liberty; neither do the Rlack Shirts in Italy. Neither
will the majority in America.
Tiie beat-the-drum and wave-lhe-flag elements in our
country today will lead this move toward Fascism. It is a
bit difficult to forecast the color of our shirts, even harder
the color of our shorts under this new system. Hut that it
is coming seems certain.
