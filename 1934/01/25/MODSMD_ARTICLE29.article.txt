# Does the Campus Think?
## 
### 
The Rally Committee is a very active body. Tliev run
rallied, rooting sections, ticket sales, dances, and them
selves. The other day they slopped running, started think
-1 f 1â€¢
They began thinking about card stunts. They no doubt
considered the fact that card stunts have been aceptcd for
many years, and that some people will object to them on
that ground. Jin t many things have been here for many
years and were finally disposed of see well mashed bon
fire, hazing graves, and others.
The Rally Committeemen who enjoy the somewhat du
bious pleasure of observing our card stunts, seem to feel
that the stunts are not attractive. Of course from the
standpoint of one who has calluses on his chin from hold
ing" those cards, who breaks into a nervous sweat at the
height of every stunt for fear he has turned black when
green was required, etc., the stunts wouldn't be attractive
even if the Rally Committee thought they were.
The Rally Committee thought that they would like to
know what the students thought about the card stunts.
Does the campus think about the question, or will they just
sil back and gripe whether the stunts remain or whether
thev go?
