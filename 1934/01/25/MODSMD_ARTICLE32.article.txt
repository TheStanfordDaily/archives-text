# MESSIMER FORESEES SLIGHT SERIES LOSS
## 
### 
According to the latest budget
drawn up by the Concert Series of
fice, the Series is expected to incur
a loss of $20.79 by the end of th % e
current season, Prentice Messimer,
student manager, said yesterday.
This deficit, based on a conserva
tive estimate for the profits of the
two concerts yet to come, is insig
nificant when compared to the $423
loss of last year, the $1,300 one of
the year before.
The probable deficit is the result
of unforseen expenses not included
ih earlier budgets.
The Concert Series presents Wal
ter Geiseking, pianist, in recital at
the Pavilion February 6. Tickets for
this concert, as well as for the suc
ceeding Rosa Ponselle presentation,
are now on sale at the Concert Se
ries' office and at Keeble's in Palo
Alto.
