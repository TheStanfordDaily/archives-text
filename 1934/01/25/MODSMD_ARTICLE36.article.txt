CRADLE SONG (Paramount)
At the Stanford Theatre
Beautiful pictorial and musical ef
fects, and a "fine performance by
Dorothea Wieck are the outstanding
features of this adaptation of the
Martinez Serra play.
Miss Wieck is distinctly impres
sive in her role of Sister Joanna,
who cares for a foundling girl, un
til the girl falls in love and leaves
the convent. And it is at this point
that the film reaches its most com
pelling heights—when Joanna real
izes that this child for whom she
has cared So long is to leave her.
The star infuses her characteriza
tion with all the ethereal beauty and
tender charm which "Maedchen" led
one to expect, and captures much of
the tragic depth of the story. She
ages with infinite skill — not with
lines and tricks of make-up, but by
creating the feeling of age, through
voice, gesture, and mood.
Yet, with all its many assets, the
film fails to move one as it should.
This, 1 believe, is largely the fault
of the director, who failed to es
tablish sufficiently the sympathetic
nature of the leading character. The
result is that one views the earlier
sequences with detachment, rather
than being a part of their mood.
Louise Dresser plays the Prioress
with charm and restraint, and leaves
a fine impression. Sir Guy Standing
is delightful in the rather superflu
ous role of Don Jose, and Evelyn
Venable is attractive as the young
girl. —Chapin
