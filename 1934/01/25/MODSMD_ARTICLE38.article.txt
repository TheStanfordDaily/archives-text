# Paramoecia Find Love After Long Battles With Fate
## 
### 
Before the abashed gaze of
fifty eager frosh in Room 439,
Biology Building, the romance
of two little paramoecia came
to a happy conclusion at 3
o'clock yesterday afternoon
Trapped in the fibers of lens
paper, the lovers were seem
ingly hopelessly caught in the
web of adverse fate. Their suc
cess should serve as an inspira
tion to Sequoia boys shattered
by one sorority sneer.
The romantic leads were
Evangeline, a pretty little piece
of protoplasm, and Poncho
Protozoa, 111. a membrance of
society. It was love at first
cytoplasm, and undismayed by
odds ar.d ends of fiber against
them, they viscuously strug
gled to love and happiness.
"Love me?" he quivered.
"Don't be cilia," she said, coyly
shaking her chlorophyll.
Where there were two, now
are three. In other words, there
was a cell out. Well. I guess
that enzym.
