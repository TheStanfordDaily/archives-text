# CAMPUS OPINION
## DISTANT DRUMS BRING YOUTH ON RUN 
### 
Editor, Stanford Daily,
Dear Sir:
With a host of L ate Grads damn
ing this and denouncing that, it be
hooves someone on the campus to
reveal the optimism ol youth and
sound a congratulatory note.
The bouquet goes to the drama
! tic manager's office for some unique
j and effective advertising of "Distant
| Drums." Lord knows some fine
j campus productions of the past have
lacked the student support they de

served because of apathetic or
sloppy advertising; half the Univer
sity didn't seem to know the date of
the play.
The present business staff has evi
dently discovered that it takes some
thing out of the ordinary to attract
student notice.
Ingenuity is certainly displayed in
Philippi's posters, and the clever ap
peal in the Daily classified ad sec
tion. Sincerely,
An Undergraduate
