A good fight has broken out in the
Senate over F.R.'s dollar devalua
tion bill. Several of the senators
are trying to tie the administration
of the act to a committee of five.
The White House thinks this idea
"obnoxious and impracticable.'' In
Congress, said McFadden of Pa.:
"It's a fiscal fraud—one of the great
est crimes ever perpetrated against
Ihe people." On the other. hand,
Borah didn't think the bill would
give enough inflation.'
