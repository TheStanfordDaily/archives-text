# Card Nine Trounces San Jose by 12 to 3
## 
### 
Coach Harry Woller's hopes for a conference championship were raised
a few pegs yesterday when the Card baseball team scored an impressive
12-3 win over San Jose State in the first game of the season, an informal
practice affair, played on the Sunken diamond. Behind the spasmodic
flashes of brilliancy of four Stanford pitchers, the Indians pounded out
ten hits and committed three errors to hold the visitors well in check In i
spite of their collection of seven safe bingles.

After both teams had counted '
one tally apiece in the opening in
ning, the scoring column remained
hare until the fifth frame when
tlie Cardinals went on a batting
rampage, pounding four bits to
bring in five runs and put the
game on ice.
Stan Anderson opened the game
on the mound for the Cards and
after a shaky first inning settled
down to allow only one hit and no
runs unlil the fifth when he was
relieved by Campbell. In the second
Anderson threw two balls and nine
strikes to retire the side on three
straight stl'ike-outs which was in
creased to five straight in tho third
when two more victims whili'ed.
Campbell Pitches
Campbell, a left-hander, took
over the pitching duties from An
derson in the fifth and during the
two innings that he worked he held
San Jose with 110 hits and no runs.
Eliot Blanchard relieved Camp
hell in the seventh, allowing four
safe blows and two runs before he
was spelled by Herringer, who
pitched the closing frame without a
hit to sully his record.
Batting Honors
Captain Dick Miles and Hamilton
shared batting honors for the day,
each getting three safe blows, Ham
ilton counted two triples and a
single in three limes at bat, and
Miles collected a triple and two
singles in four trips.
Blethen, center fielder for the vis
itors, was outstanding with two
singles and a double to his credit.
