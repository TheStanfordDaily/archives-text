# HOOPSTERS READY FOR S.C. TANGLE
## 
### 
Having coasted through an unim
portant, one-sided loss to the Olym
pic Club, Stanford's basketball team
yesterday began the serious task of
preparing lor their Friday and Sat
urday night contests against U.S.C.
i in Los Angeles.
* The problem of stopping U.S.C.
pretty much resolves itself into
stopping Libro Guttero, the Tro
jans' lanky, dead-eye basket
shooter, who holds down the
all-important pivot job. Guttero,
who leads the conference in scor
ing, went wild in S.C'.'s massacre
of California in the second game
of their series and likewise car
ried off high-point honors in the
Trojans' game with U.C.L.A.
Another phase of the problem of
, beating S.C. consists of shaking
Keith Topping loose from the tena
cious Trojan man-for-man defense.
Thus a large part of last night's
practice session found the first team
I scrimmaging against the reserves,
! who used the S.C. man-for-man de
! fense.
Leaving tonight for the south, the
12 men who will make the trip are:
forwards, Topping, Anderson, Co
wing, Hershey, and Shreve; centers,
Edelen and Gorter; guards, Maila
! tratt, Rogex-s, Page, Lindsey, and
Farber. Gorter has been shifted to
| center, with A1 Hershey switching
j over to the forward post.
