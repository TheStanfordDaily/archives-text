# CINDER TRIALS SHOW PROMISE
## 
### 
Dink T empleton's face was
wreathed in smiles as some of his
boys—Nfmmo, Meier, Kingsbury, et
al, turned in some first-class per
formances yesterday.
Chuck Nimmo deserves tne after
noon's blue ribbon, running 'three
laps in the commendable time of
3.13:7. When Ben Eastman, was in
top shape he covered the same
amount of ground in 3.09 and there
abouts, so by comparison with the
woild record breaker rfcmmo is light
up there. If he had run the full
four laps, he would have stopped
pretty close to 4.20, and that is fast,
anywhere.
Meier Takes Hurdles
Then in the hurdles, Capt. Meier,
Hunt Kingsbury, and Ernie Evans
ran some nice flights, Gus winning
bath, the highs at 15 flat, and the
lows at 24.').
Kingsbury looked better than he
has all year, finishing a scant yard
behind Gus in the highs and run
ning right even with him in the
lows, till he tripped on the last hur
dle. Evans was pretty close in both
flights.
Voigt 440 Prospect
Chuck Voigt, a freshman from
Colorado, turned in a double perfor
mance, cinching his broad-jump
prospects with a leap over 21. feet,
and a 352 jaunt in 39.6, right behind
Al Blackman's time of 38.4.
Joe Burns led a parade of mid
dle-distanco men in a 660 in 1.24:6,
followed by Deßretteville and Sor
enson. Lloyd Schween cleared six
feet in his event.
