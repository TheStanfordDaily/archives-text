Stanford University has an excel
lent opportunity at hand to gain a
hodful of the best publicity in the
world at a cheap price by allowing
the Stanford Rugby Club to accept
an invitation to meet Cambridge on
the rugger held.
Of course the big hurdle to he
surmounted, aside from the finan
cial end, would be disapproval of
the administration on scholastic
grounds. Uut if Cambridge stu
dents can afford a respite from
their studies ui come to America
to play rugby, then Stanford ought
to he able to meet them half way.
But the prestige connected with
such an athletic match should fairly
make any college administration's
eyes hand out. Just Stanford, we—
and Cambridge University, with
Harvard, Princeton, and Yale thrown
in for good measure. It would be a
distinction for Stanford to compdte
in the company of such traditional
big shots of the scholastic and ath
letic world.
And Harry Maloney, for one, is
assured that a Stanford team
would acquit itself with honor,
athletically, and sportingly. He is
right proud of the growing sheaf
of letters of commendation that
follows appearances of his rugger
boys. The combined Stanford-
California team drew a hearty re
sponse from British Columbia and
nearly daily he receives a report
from someone commenting on the
favorable impression made there
by the team.
And as a result of their game
against the San Francisco Blues lasl
Saturday he has received communi
cations from the captain of the
Blues, congratulating the Stanforc
boys for the clean, sporting game
they played; and from the referee
of the game, who echoes the Blues
| sentiments.
If Stanford can gain such atten
tion on the Pacific Coast, the re

j turns from a New York trip would
he tremendous, and quite worth
while from an entirely business
standpoint. The games would
easily he self-sustaining, as the
eastern colleges have whipped up
considerable enthusiasm.
Furthermore, rugby teams, unlike
their football brethren, have devel
oped habits of traveling economi
cally, and $2,500 would be sufficient
to underwrite the trip, compared to
the reputed $20,000 spent by the Co
lumbia gridders recently.
At first glance of the rugby play
ers the proposal looks too good a
thing to ever become an actuality,
with the odds at 100 to 1 against its
i approval by the authorities. It is,
'■ however, an opportunity which we
j shall not see the like again soon, and
is certainly worth serious consider
i ation. —Hamilton

they played; and from the referee
of the game, who echoes the Blues
| sentiments.
If Stanford can gain such atten
tion on the Pacific Coast, the re

j turns from a New York trip would
he tremendous, and quite worth
while from an entirely business
standpoint. The games would
easily he self-sustaining, as the
eastern colleges have whipped up
considerable enthusiasm.
Furthermore, rugby teams, unlike
their football brethren, have devel
oped habits of traveling economi
cally, and $2,500 would be sufficient
to underwrite the trip, compared to
the reputed $20,000 spent by the Co
lumbia gridders recently.
At first glance of the rugby play
ers the proposal looks too good a
thing to ever become an actuality,
with the odds at 100 to 1 against its
i approval by the authorities. It is,
'■ however, an opportunity which we

is certainly worth serious consider

Stanford University has an excel
lent opportunity at hand to gain a
hodful of the best publicity in the
world at a cheap price by allowing
the Stanford Rugby Club to accept
an invitation to meet Cambridge on
the rugger held.
Of course the big hurdle to he
surmounted, aside from the finan
cial end, would be disapproval of
the administration on scholastic
grounds. Uut if Cambridge stu
dents can afford a respite from
their studies ui come to America
to play rugby, then Stanford ought
to he able to meet them half way.
But the prestige connected with
such an athletic match should fairly
make any college administration's
eyes hand out. Just Stanford, we—
and Cambridge University, with
Harvard, Princeton, and Yale thrown
in for good measure. It would be a
distinction for Stanford to compdte
in the company of such traditional
big shots of the scholastic and ath
letic world.
And Harry Maloney, for one, is
assured that a Stanford team
would acquit itself with honor,
athletically, and sportingly. He is
right proud of the growing sheaf
of letters of commendation that
follows appearances of his rugger
boys. The combined Stanford-
California team drew a hearty re
sponse from British Columbia and
nearly daily he receives a report
from someone commenting on the
favorable impression made there
by the team.
And as a result of their game
against the San Francisco Blues lasl
Saturday he has received communi
cations from the captain of the
Blues, congratulating the Stanforc
boys for the clean, sporting game
they played; and from the referee
of the game, who echoes the Blues
| sentiments.
