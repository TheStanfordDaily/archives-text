# Helen Watters Appointed Women's Hoop Manager
## 
### 
At the board meeting of the
Women's Athletic Association last
night Helen Watters was appointed
basketball manager. She will fill the
place left vacant by Iris Forsyth's
illness and withdrawal from school.
A double tournament will be held
in basketball this year, because of
the large turnout in each class. A
first and second team will be chosen
from each class. As there is a lack
of junior members, the freshman
third team will substitute for the
junior second team.
