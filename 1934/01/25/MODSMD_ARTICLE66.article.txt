# STUDENT ACTIVITIES SHOW GOOD FINANCIAL CONDITION
## 
### 
A healthy financial condition of
all student activities during autumn
quarter is shown in the regular
quarterly report submitted to the
Executive Committee by Student
Manager Les Hables.
The Daily, Quad, Chaparral, and
debating activities arc staying well
within their budgets, with the
Daily reporting a profit.
The Concert Series received some
set-backs during the past quarter,
when rains, fraternity, and other ac
tivities cut in on their concert dates.
Unless better support is given the
series, hard-working Manager Pren
tice Messimer reports, because of a
conservative budget, ihe series stands
to lose about $20. However, definite
predictions for the future cannot be
made because popular Walter Giese
king and Rosa Ponsellc will prob
ably draw lai'ge crowds.
A.S.S.U. dances, which started
with the plan of giving students
frequent campus social affairs,
have broken about even, showing
a slight profit.
The Stanford Quad showed a $781
increase in general subscriptions,
with a falling-off of $848 in senior
sales. Quad Manager Harold Whit
field said this lack of co-operation
on the part of the senior class might
lead to serious complications for the
publication in future years.
Chaparral advertising showed a
slight gain over last year. Manager
Bob de Roos reported that the de
crease in subscription price to 15
cents per copy increased subscrip

tions from the point of money taken
in and number of copies sold.
Although the Daily has had an
increase of $181 in total costs due
to a larger number of issues, Man
ager Louis Ottenheimer reports
there has been a reduction of 4
per cent in the cost per issue. It
has had a 27.82 per cent increase
in display advertising despite un
favorable Palo Alto conditions.
However, no final conclusion on
student group finances can be drawn
from these figures, which were sub
mitted to the Ex Committee by the
student manager. Conditions during
the winter and spring quarters will
have an important effect one way
or the other on the finances of the
publications by the end of the year.
