# S.F.U. Dons, Indian Ruggers Will Play Charity Tilt Here
## Relief Committee Plans To Raise Fund For Needy Students 
### 
Resumption of the charity rugby
tilts which were a feature of the
Student Relief Committee's drive
for funds last year will occur Sat
urday when Stanford clases with
San Francisco University here in
the Stadium.
With the appointment yesterday
of North Baker as chairman of the ,
Student Relief Committee, plans for
the contest were rapidly formulated, j
with Harry Maloney, president of ;
the Northern California Rugby
Union, and Abe Hables, student
manager, concurring in the arrange
ments.
Dons New Team
The San Francisco Dons are a new
force in local rugger circles, and
played their first game last week
against the San Francisco Barba
rians, one of the stronger teams in
the league. The Dons lost a hard
fought game 10-0, after holding the
more experienced Barbs scoreless
for three-fourths of the games.
The Stanford team has gone un- 1
defeated in California rugby since;
its first game last year. Until San 1
Jose caught the squad napping two
weeks back and held the Indians to
a scoreless tie, they had an unin- ;
terrupted record of victories. AI
combined Stanford and California
team holds the Pacific Coast Inter- j
collegiate title, having wrested the:
championship from the University of
British Columbia last Christmas day.
25-Cent Admittance
The relief committee will get un
der way with a ticket drive today
and tomorrow, with admittance
priced at 25 cents. Last year a simi
lar contest with Stanford appearing
against the S.F. Barbarians netted
$400 which all went into the relief
coffers.
That game marked the revival of
rugby on the Stanford campus and
i since that time the Cardinal team
1 has climbed to rugby eminence on
the Pacific Coast, competed against
i Canadian teams in an international
series, and received invitations to
| play Cambridge University, Yale,
: Harvard, and Princeton teams in
America; to tour New Zealand, Aus
tralia, and Japan with its flying cir
cus of speedy backs and power
| packed scrum.
The Stanford team will take its
, final workout before the game this
j afternoon. Last Saturday in winning
| 21-0 from the San Francisco Blues,
j the Indians performed in a fashion
ito please the eyes of Coach Jim
Wylie, who used to play in the scrum
for New Zealand's famed All-
Blacks.

championship from the University of
British Columbia last Christmas day.
25-Cent Admittance
The relief committee will get un
der way with a ticket drive today
and tomorrow, with admittance
priced at 25 cents. Last year a simi
lar contest with Stanford appearing
against the S.F. Barbarians netted
$400 which all went into the relief
coffers.
That game marked the revival of
rugby on the Stanford campus and
i since that time the Cardinal team
1 has climbed to rugby eminence on
the Pacific Coast, competed against
i Canadian teams in an international
series, and received invitations to
| play Cambridge University, Yale,
: Harvard, and Princeton teams in
America; to tour New Zealand, Aus
tralia, and Japan with its flying cir
cus of speedy backs and power
| packed scrum.
The Stanford team will take its
, final workout before the game this
j afternoon. Last Saturday in winning
| 21-0 from the San Francisco Blues,
j the Indians performed in a fashion
ito please the eyes of Coach Jim
Wylie, who used to play in the scrum
for New Zealand's famed All-
Blacks.
Resumption of the charity rugby
tilts which were a feature of the
Student Relief Committee's drive
for funds last year will occur Sat
urday when Stanford clases with
San Francisco University here in
the Stadium.
With the appointment yesterday
of North Baker as chairman of the ,
Student Relief Committee, plans for
the contest were rapidly formulated, j
with Harry Maloney, president of ;
the Northern California Rugby
Union, and Abe Hables, student
manager, concurring in the arrange
ments.
Dons New Team
The San Francisco Dons are a new
force in local rugger circles, and
played their first game last week
against the San Francisco Barba
rians, one of the stronger teams in
the league. The Dons lost a hard
fought game 10-0, after holding the
more experienced Barbs scoreless
for three-fourths of the games.
The Stanford team has gone un- 1
defeated in California rugby since;
its first game last year. Until San 1
Jose caught the squad napping two
weeks back and held the Indians to
a scoreless tie, they had an unin- ;
terrupted record of victories. AI
combined Stanford and California
team holds the Pacific Coast Inter- j
collegiate title, having wrested the:
championship from the University of
British Columbia last Christmas day.
