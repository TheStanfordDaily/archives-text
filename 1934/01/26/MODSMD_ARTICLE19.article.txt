pursuers and was still at large last
night, although police believe they
were closing in on him.
Victor Cruz, freshman registered
from Chihuahua, Mexico, entered
Room 121 and found the man,
dressed in cords and a chamois
jacket, just completing the bundle.
Surprised, the stranger said:
"Have you a Bawl-out?''
"No," the freshman replied. Sus
picious of the man's presence, Cruz
told him to remain in the room un
til he made clear his identity.
"You have no reason to hold me,"
the man replied politely. With thai
he left, Cruz following him a mo
ment later. Cruz trailed him as far
as Angell Field, where the thief sud
denly darted behind a hedge, around
a house and made his escape.
Gives Fake Name
The thief gave the name of Harry
Anderson, 446 Kipling Street, Palo
Alto, to Cruz while in the room,
but a checkup by Officer Gordon
Davis of the Stanford police force
revealed that no such person lived
there.
Officers Davis and George Burns
showed pictures of a suspect to
Cruz yesterday afternoon, and the
.student was almost certain that it
was the same person. The police
were searching for the man, whose
name was being kept secret, last
night. An arrest was expected mo
mentarily.
Cruz described the robber as five
feet, six inches tall; slender; dark
brown, curly hair; good complexion,
slightly dark; dressed in white cords
and a chamois jacket. He is very
polite, generally addressing people
by "sir."
May Be Usual Thief
While the search was being con
ducted, the officers were verifying
their beliefs that the Encina robber
might have been the same individ
ual who early yesterday morning
added two more victims to his long
list.

midnight and 1 a.m., he removed a
quantity of personal belongings and

he told officers, and when Webster
entered the room shortly after 1
o'clock the robbery was discovered,
Entrance had been gained with a
key.
