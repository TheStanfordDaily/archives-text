Powerful Dons

San Francisco University will
bring a strong crew of Dons to the
Farm; men who will be playing their
third game of rugby, and have a lot
to learn about the finer points. They
play hard, with all the line cracking
ideas learned from a life time of
American football.
Last week these same Dons held
the strong Barbarian Clul) team
oft for nearly tbe whole game, al
lowing the Barbs to push over two
trys, which were subsequently
converted to give the Barbs a 10-0
victory. This will be the only in
tercollegiate rugger competition
played at Stanford this season.
The Stanford backficld, which
functioned 1o such advantage in the
first half against the San Francisco
Blues last Saturday that it set old
sters to thinking about tie famous
New Zealand All-Blacks of 20 years
ago, will be handicapped by the loss
of center three-quarter Bill Sim to
morrow.
Bill Sim Out
Sim has an injured ankle and will
be unable to go; Lee Irelan. the
rambling fullback of the Indians,
has been practicing this week and
probably will not start, and Jack
Hillman, who was taking to the
scrum in a pleasing way, likewise
will be on the sidelines.
Moreover, big Milt Keller, whose
weight is a powerful brace in the
scrum, reported with a damaged ear
yesterday, and will not be able to
engage in much play. A < aulifiower
ear sounds like a smail affair to
keep a man out of an important
game, but ears grow exceedingly
tender in the scrum where the play
ers have to get their heads down
and root in the mud.
