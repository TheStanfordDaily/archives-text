# Hotel Idea at Union Dance
## 
### 
Fountains playing among potted
plants will feature the decoration of j
the Union Club's Formal, scheduled
for 9 o'clock tonight in ihe lobby
and dining room of the Un ; on.
First formal since wo.nen took
over the Union, women committee \
members, led by Chairman Jane !
Hillebrand, are unhampered by tra- j
dition and aim to use ideas cf trans- |
fers from other schools.
An innovation is the hotel atmos- j
phere that will be lent by the use
of tables for couples, Rushton's j
Royal Cardinals providing the mu- j
sic in between the two rooms.
Instead of the traditional punch j
and cookies, Union dance guests will
be served frozen fruit si lad, fancy j
crackers, and demi-tasse. Pitchers
of punch will be placed on the I
tables to furnish "sipping" enter
tainment between dances.
