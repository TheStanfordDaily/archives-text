# WE SLIPPED, IDAHO

### 
The Daily again is obliged lo lake notice of its own
inaccuracy, especially in the small matters which are most
likely lo annoy the readers and those who furnish the
sources Cor information.
Many things-have been brought to our attention during
the course of the present volume, wherein the Daily had
erred in giving the facts in a news story. We have tried to
do away with the evil. But now it crops up again in a very
serious form, since the mistake concerns the native heath
of a member of the Editorial Board, Idaho.
A student connected with the production of "Distant
Drums" brought the fact lo the attention of Director Har
old Ilclvcnston that the action of one act took place be
tween two historic places in Idaho, Fort Boise and Fort
llall. Mr. Ilclvcnston, interested, gave the information to
a Daily reporter, who in turn made it the center of that
day's storv. But sadlv enough, the forts were placed in
lowa. That is too bad, for aside from explosive Mr. Borah
and the potato, Idaho gets very little publicity, and its sons
and daughters are very jealous that it get its due.
When the deadline nears and the presses* roar fills our
ears, we sometimes trample heavily on someone's special
tield. So Hail, Borah! Hail, the Spud! Hail, Idaho!
