# Rugby on Saturday
## 
### 
That relief is necessary at Stanford seems too obvious
to re(|uire or receive much discussion. The fact is that
I lie erroneous impression of 1928 that Stanford was a
home of millionaires is still erroneous, even more so. The
tuition of alone exists to lend color to that rumor;
and Ihc mounting number of tuition notes eradicates that
color.
The Rugby Game 111 is Saturday should realize hun
dreds of dollars for Stanford Relief. Those who like rugby
will gel their money's worth and more. Those who can't
attend the game are under moral obligation to purchase
tickets anyway.
For we university people, self and generally admitted
to be superior to the mass, must acquire the giving habit.
On our shoulders wiii be the responsibility for the upkeep
of charities. We can up our snoots in haughty disdain, but
the fact remains that if we do not give, people will suffer.
As individualistic and as superior as you choose to be,
your fellow man is stil! a fellow man. He may be less in
telligent; but he still has ten toes, a stomach, and a pair
of kidneys. He is your burden. It is because of him that
you are a success; and you owe him an obligation just as
you owe one to your kin, though the obligation of course
is not as keen.
Though we live in a land of reputed "equal" oppor
tunity, we all know that equality is to a great extent ver
biage; and though it were not, there is the inequality of
birth over which Fourth of July orators have no control.
Orations to the contrary, some are born high class morons,
rhev are our charge; we, who consider ourselves superior,
t'ntil wholesale birth control and race selection in the
Platonic manner, the incompetent will ever be with us.
Of course, the local problem is nothing like the sour
picture painted aboveâ€”such painting no doubt due to a
lack of sleep and some stale breakfast coffee consumed at
midnight bv the editor. Locally, we have fellows trying to
acquire an education and self-support simultaneously. It
is a stiff job; and Student Relief merely gives them an
opportunity to work for a nominal hourly wage.
You help them by attending tomorrow; but more than
that you prepare yourself for what lies ahead.
