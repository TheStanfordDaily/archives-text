# Is It Farewell Forever?

As we have taken pains !o point out, Hie Rally Com
mittee is considering card stunts. They realize that they
cost the student body a considerable sum. They tell us
thev do not look any too good, and we can readily believe
them. Further, most rooters are willing to let all the labor
take place on the playing field.
This being w hat it is, it looks as it' the Rally Committee
may recommend abolition of these stunts. Of course, as
President. Trautman points out, the card stunts are one
way to distinguish between an amateur and a professional
football game. Of course, a nice big bill-board telling peo
ple might serve the same purpose; and be less a burden on
students.
Put of course if students enjoy card stunts, that should
be considered. After all. universities are run on the prin
ciple of the least pain for the greatest number, and you
can fool practically everybody all the time. So why don't
we hear from those interested?
To be more direct: do you, Mr. Stanford Student, want
card stunts? Answer: yes or no. Or in just about the same
number of words and arriving at the same result with a
possible double negative to boot: Don't you want card
stunts? Answer: ves or no.
