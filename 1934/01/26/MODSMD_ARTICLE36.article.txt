# The 						New Year Is Off
## 
### 
Well, another year is on its merry way. Another lynch
ing has taken place. Another negro is no longer worrying
about his constitutional rights. And some ten million ne
groes have been given another cruel manifestation that all
that is not written is not so.
This is America. The lynching happened in Kentucky,
and though some do not like to face the facts, Kentucky is
part of America. This lynching happened in America -
where men are equal before the law; and where govern
ment is by law and not by men.
If three negroes are found participating in the heinous
game of craps, the judge will in due course ask them:
"Don't you know that shooting craps is against the law?"
We can well wonder what the family of the murdered
man are now .thinking.
Needless to add, the crowd dispersed just as the while
officers arrived.
