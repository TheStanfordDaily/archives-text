The Editor, Sir:
Who is this guy Waltman? As
regular customers of the Cellar, v/e!
feel that an injustice has been done. !
Although we feel that the Cellar has ;
often taken advantage of its monop- i
oly, we find Cellar service entirely |
adequate and well adapted to the
demands of two hundred noontime :
lunchers. Do we want humble,
;
cringing service from our fellow j
classmates? Are they not men? j
Their spirit has been one of con
sistent friendliness and helpfulness, i
and has kept the Cellar from being j
just another restaurant. Indeed they :
exemplify the highest ideals of >
Christiandom and the American
democracy in their every gesture, I
their every word. Who would have
it otherwise?
