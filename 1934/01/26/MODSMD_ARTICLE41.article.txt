# Prison Hardships
## 
### 
La Guardia's Commissioner of
Correction McCormick yesterday
raided (of all places) the Welfare
Island city prison and discovered
that the place is being ruled by a
bunch of racketeers. La Guardia
wasn't at all surprised and blamed
Tammany. Gang leaders v/fre found
with all sorts of weapons, carrier
pigeons, all kinds of dope, a private
ice box, and were living in the hos
pital ward which was fixed up like
a hotel, with private phones and
fancy food. Something will defi
nitely be done.
