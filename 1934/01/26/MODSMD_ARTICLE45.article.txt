BEHIND THE LINES AGAIN. (Comment upon an excellent English film)

When the shouting over "The |
Private Life of Henry VIII" had
died down and critics had got over i
their first amazement at this com- '
paratively fine English film, their
second thoughts were cooler and j
less unrestrained in praise of a good j
but very limited picture.
Meanwhile, a film in many ways ;
finer and far more sensitive, has J
been circulating in second-run thea- I
tres, receiving none of the praise;
which is .'ts undeniably just due.
The picture is Fox-Gaumont's "I 1
Was a Spy."
The subject of the secret agent
has, it must be admitted, given rise j
to an increasingly shallow series of ,
cinematic melodramas. It is all the
more distressing that this film, at
once authentic and sincerely dra- j
matic, should be classed casually as I
one of a declining series and so dis
missed.
> The pioture concerns Marthe
Cnockhaert, drawn away from her
justified' hatred of an invading army
by the sight of the sufferers being !
transferred from a train to an im- i
provLsed hospital, thence down ir- 1
j tsistably deeper and deeper into
espionage against the invaders, and !
fir ally detected.
This bald statement of the plot is j
far less remarkable than its actual I
progress and the pitiful futility of
all of the endeavors. She aids the |
Germans only to be forced to be- j
tray them and see the hospital ward ;
ull of tortured humans; she sac- ]
rifices herself to obtain valuable in- i
formation which suddenly becomes i
useless and quickly bertays her.
Two scenes are of deep poig- !
nancy: the presentation to her of
the Iron Cross for her aid to a hos- j
pital which her information has just j
re-fillcd; her quiet entrance to her |
lover in the hospital after she has
returned from the trip to Brussels
which was at once so costly and so
useless.
The cast is fine. Madeleine Car
roll plays Marthe with an exquisite
minimum of statement. Herbert
Marshall is the zealot who realizes
too late that he loves the woman
whom he has drawn too far into the
net of intrigue. Conrad Veidt, like
the other members of the cast, de
pends for his effect upon a skilfull
underplaying which assists the ad
mirably maintained note of authen
ticity and never wavers in force. In j
a small role Gerald du Maurier \

plays quietly, leaves a deep impres
sion.
The film is aided by a lack of the
ostentation which makes so many
American films—in background at
least—a theatrical display rather
than a proportionately modest scene.
The script is occasionally erratic in
movement and the recording lacks
the technical excellence of the av
erage American film. But neither of
these things, comparatively trivial
as they are, detracts materially from
an unusually good film. —Sandoe
