CLIPPINGS FROM
CONTEMPORARY COLUMNS
Flipping through the leaves of
collegiate exchanges we read with
interest in Mr. Bill Dickie's "Signals '
Over" column of the U. of Wa.sh- j
inglon Daily:
"At the football banquet just be- j
fore Christmas, Jimmy Phelan re
turned to the practice of electing a '
field leader for the entire season :
after a year's lay-off. There were a ;
number of eligible juniors for the j
post, but Matt Muczynski and
Woody Ullin stood out from the |
pack.
"On the first ballot. Matt and
Woody came out all square wlu-n
the 28 letter winners had cast
their tickets. As they were pre
paring to vote again, Matt an- i
noil need his withdrawal in favor
of Ullin because 'a linesman can
pat his fellow linesmen on the j
back and encourage 'em more than 1
a backfiehl man can,' to put it in
Matt's own words. Next to win- !
ning posts on all-conference or
all-coast or all - something - or
other teams, the honor of being !
team captain lies closest to an
athlete's heart, so you can see the j
sportsmanship Matt Muczynski
.... showed by his act."
j
A football player and still an 1
idealist. Excellent, Mr. Muczyniski. |
And now we turn to the U.C.L.A. |
Daily Bruin, wherein Mr. John
Zentmyer says in his "The Sport
Parade:"
I
"Lines of worry are beginning to !
wreath the usually calm brow of;
Harry Trotter, genial track mentor. 1
"The reason seems to be that the
athletes are neglecting to appear j
for practice. Just a slight matter, I
understand, as the Bruins really
haven't much of a schedule ahead I
of them. They only face some i
slight opposition, such as the Tro- i
jans, Stanford, California, and a
few other mcdiocre performers |
such as will appear in the I.C.A.
A.A.A., and a few other similar
meets.
"The first meet is on March 3, j
with Pomona, which means that two j
weeks after the spring semester!
opens the men must be in shape. !
Maybe they will be, but just be- j
tween you and me I'd hate to lose }
to the Sagehens because I wasn't in
condition."
Looks as if the U.C.L.A. track coach
was utilizing -the Daily Bruin for
some insidious propaganda to stir
up a nonchalant squad. However,
Mr. Zentmyer has always been the
most gentlemanly of the collegiate |
sports writers, who as a type tra
ditionally r.urse a gripe. To prove i
that yours truly is not the only one |
of the ilk, we quote Frank Breese, 1
whose "Breezings" appear in the ;
Southern California Daily Trojan:
"Among overrated basketball
players, Duke Trotter, U.C.L.A.'s
florid center, is a standout.
It is not poor Duke's fault that
he has been hallyliooed beyond
his capabilities nor is it his fault
that he is unable to play high
class ball. He is a good mediocre
player, and tries hard, but it
takes more than effort to produce
in a hoop game.
"He was lest trying to guard Lee
Guttero, but then Lee was hot, and !
he was coining baskets that no guard
could have checked. Trotter would
approach Guttero, arms outstretched
like a spread eagle. 'Shoot, Lee,'
he would urge, 'C'mon, shoot.'
"And Lee would sink the blad- '
tier. Trotter would turn away in
disgust. 'G - - - &768Vjc! (sic),' he
would mutter under his breath."

That's a bit mild, as far as real
deep-down-in-the-roots, bona fide
griping goes. We know, because
we've done it often enough in the
past. Some day when copy is short,
we're going to quote ourselves, and
reprint some of the prized gripes
that have appeared in these columns
of Volume 84. â€”Hamilton
