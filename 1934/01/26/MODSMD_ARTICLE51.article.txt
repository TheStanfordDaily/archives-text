# TRACKSTERS FACE INAUGURAL COMPETITION TODAY; CLOSE FIGHT PROMISED IN HURDLES
## 
### 
Indian track and field men shed
sweat suits this afternoon, put on
their respective fighting f.ices and
go through their first reai competi
tion of the 1934 season.
The running events bring forth
interesting highlights. There are
Thomas, Williams, March, Nimmo,
Klopstock, Kingsbury, and others
upon whom hinges the future of
Stanford track.
In the hurdles some of the fiercest
competition seen hereabouts will be
run off with Meier, Klopstock, and
Kingsbury all leaning toward a pos
sible victory. The last two are but
sophomores who can flick over the
barriers fast enough 1o kÂ«.ep up with
their captain, Meier, the defending
national champ.
Carlton Thorns, the man upon
whom all eyes are focused, will
grace the straightaway in 'both
sprints. Whether this Card can
shade 9.8 consistently or not will
mean a lot in the way of points
in the more important meets. Fred
Williams, a fine frosli piespect, al
though not yet at top shape, will
run.
Although Johnny Motiram has the

| javelin virtually in the bag, there
will be Ray Williamson, who may
place. The big frosh tucked his
spear away close to the 170-foot
mark Wednesday, and he really
likes to throw it, and wants to do
' things. Bill Beatty hovers around
190, with Dud Sales right behind.
John Lyman is at present ham
pered by an ailing ankle, and can
, not do his usual 50 feet, with Gordy
Dunn at 47 and Jim Reynolds, Cab
t Calloway, and Bob Reynolds also
j cavorting in the ring. The same
i men plus a half-dozen others doing
around 120 feet will compete.
