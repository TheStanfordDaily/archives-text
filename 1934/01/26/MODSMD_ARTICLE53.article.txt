# ST. MARY'S FROSH, STOCKTON HI FIVES MEET CARD BABES
## 
### Bv Mort D'Evelyn 
With two classy fives for opposi- j
tion, Stanford's flashy Babe quintet j
will entertain campus basketball j
: fans over the week-end with two j
spirited contests while the varsity ;
sojourns in the south.
Tonight St. Mary's frosh bring an
unbeatable record to the Farm
while Stockton High, famed for its
consistently winning basketball j
teams, will provide the opposition
tomorrow night. Both gain~s will be
I played in the Pavilion and will open j
at 7:30 o'clock.
Gaels High Scoring
If Jimmy Bradshaw's forces can
i eke out a win over the boys from
iVioraga Valley tonight they will ful
i fill all advance notices w th plenty
ito spare. The St. Mary's first-year
; men boast a clean slate and the rec
ord of having scored .over 50 points
| against all opponents bat one, the
latter being the California frosh
; which they tamed by a 43-17 mar
, gin last Monday night. The Gael
yearlings are a tall, rugged live
playing a free-shooting game, quick
to take advantage of the breaks â€”
a style that can't be beat from the
spectators' standpoint.
Advance press notices aie scarce
jon Stockton High's hopes, but a
i strong nucleus, composed of veter
i ans of last year's Northern Califor
nia prep champs, will make ihe Tar
zans a tough team to trim. The man
to watch is a tricky forward, Par
; sons, who has been a thorn in the
j side of valley fives for the past three
! years.
Defensive Play to Tell
What will probably be the margin of
victory and defeat in both encoun
ters will be Stanford's center court
and under bucket defense, which
has been given a thorough drilling
during the past week. Key of the
St. Mary's attack is one Gianoni,
hefty center, who scored eight field
goals against the California frosh. If
the guards, Carl Schott and Dinty
Moore, with the aid of center Dale
Beedle's height and weight can
clamp down on the middle court
area, including the elusive Gianoni,
the Card Babes four-poim advan
tage by comparative scores should

give them n win. To handle possi
ble hot forwards, Bradshaw has in
stigated a man-to-man defensive
play for the two Indian forwards,
Howell Turner and Bill Quade.
Another game will depend on
tight defensive work Saturday night
for the Stockton offense is rough
and crashing, depending on follow
up shots for their floor go;^s.
Tonight's lineup, Stanford frosh:
Turner and Quade, forwards; Bee
die, center; Moore and Schott,
guards. St. Mary's frosh* Nelson
and Olsen, forwards; Gianoni, cen
ter; Irwin and Petri, guards.
