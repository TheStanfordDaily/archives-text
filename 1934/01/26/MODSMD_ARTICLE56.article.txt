## 
### 
The Daily Californian, which
I seeks to fill the place of a student
jnewspaper on the 13.C. campus, re
cently earned a front page article
quoting Gloria Stuart, Cal '31, and
Hollywood '33, '34, etc., to the ef
fect that "college women are better
dressed than Hollywood women."
Gloria meant U.C., of course. That's
i nice.
