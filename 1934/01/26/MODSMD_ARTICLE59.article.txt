# SEQUOIA MAN WORKS AS DEEP SEA DIVER TO GATHER SPECIMENS IN ISLAND WATERS
## 
### RUSSELL PAINE 
Professional deep sea diving is the
part-time summer occupation of
Edward Butterworth, '36, resident of
Sequoia Hall, who has had many
thrilling experiences and close calls
underneath the surface of the ocean
at Catalina Island.
Butterworth is assistant scout
master at the farthest camp on the
island for eight weeks every sum
mer and then deep sea diving in
structor for five weeks for various
groups which vacation at the camp.
Uses Diving Bell
Using a regulation navy diving
bell which permits him to go down
over 60 feet into the marine forests,
Butterworth collects abalone shells
and various other sea specimens fox
high school and college zoology pro
fessors.
Great canyons and mountains pre
sent hazards for the divers. Butter
worth told of the narrowest escape
of his undersea explorations which
occurred when he jumped over a
little clifT of about 20 feet and be
gan to sink into a deep, cavern-like
Pit-
With only five feet of air tube
left he finally managed to check his
fall by catching hold of the anchor
line of a yacht. Five feet more and

I his air tube would have snapped,
cutting off his air supply.
The diving apparatus used re
j quires six persons to operate. Two
men are pumping air continually,
1 two on hand ready to pump, one
holds the life and air lines, and one
| good swimmer is always ready to
go into the water in case of emer
-5 gency.
Rays Dangerous
The greatest animal danger comes
from the sting rays, Butterworth ex
; plained, for the sharks are usually
! afraid and there are few barracuda
in the Cauiiina watex-s. The divei's
are often forced to go to great depths
to loosen yacht anchors which have
become wadged between rocks, he
' said.
t Butterworth also told of an expe
rience of drifting out into the chan
nel for a whole day after his small
dinghy capsized, and of being res
cucd by a fishing boat just as dark
ness was setting on.
Likes Work
"I like the diving work very
much," Butterworth agreed, "ae
j spite all the dangers connected with
it. One cannot imagine the beauty
of marine life until he actually sees
, it."

mer and then deep sea diving in
structor for five weeks for various
groups which vacation at the camp.
Uses Diving Bell
Using a regulation navy diving
bell which permits him to go down
over 60 feet into the marine forests,
Butterworth collects abalone shells
and various other sea specimens fox
high school and college zoology pro
fessors.
Great canyons and mountains pre
sent hazards for the divers. Butter
worth told of the narrowest escape
of his undersea explorations which
occurred when he jumped over a
little clifT of about 20 feet and be
gan to sink into a deep, cavern-like
Pit-
With only five feet of air tube
left he finally managed to check his
fall by catching hold of the anchor
line of a yacht. Five feet more and

I his air tube would have snapped,
cutting off his air supply.
The diving apparatus used re
j quires six persons to operate. Two
men are pumping air continually,
1 two on hand ready to pump, one
holds the life and air lines, and one
| good swimmer is always ready to
go into the water in case of emer
-5 gency.
Rays Dangerous
The greatest animal danger comes
from the sting rays, Butterworth ex
; plained, for the sharks are usually
! afraid and there are few barracuda
in the Cauiiina watex-s. The divei's
are often forced to go to great depths
to loosen yacht anchors which have
become wadged between rocks, he
' said.
t Butterworth also told of an expe
rience of drifting out into the chan
nel for a whole day after his small
dinghy capsized, and of being res
cucd by a fishing boat just as dark
ness was setting on.
Likes Work
"I like the diving work very
much," Butterworth agreed, "ae
j spite all the dangers connected with
it. One cannot imagine the beauty
of marine life until he actually sees
, it."
