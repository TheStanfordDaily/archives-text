## 
### 
American and English holders of
German bonds have lodged fiery and
numerous protests to the Reichs
bank. Say they: the Ge. mans are
paying interest in full to citizens of
countries with whom Germany has
made trade "deals." They thing
that is pretty funny and also don't
like the fact that Germans ate stop
ping interest payments rnd then
buying up the depreciated bonds.
American and British ambassadors
are both helping in the protesting.
Billions of dollars are involved in
the affair.
