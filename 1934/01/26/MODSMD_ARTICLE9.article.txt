# CARDS AIM TO SHAKE TROJAN HOPES TONIGHT
## Stanford Hopes to Get Win Over U.S.C. in Series CAL MAY BEAT U.C.L.A. Bunn May Use Last Week's Combination to Start 
### Chuck Chappell 
With the Trojans battling, for a
conference championship and Stan
ford struggling for a place in the
basketball sun, Coach Jo!m Bunn's
Indians will meet S.C. tonight and
tomorrow night at Los Angeles in
the first pair of their 1931 series of
games.
If Stanford can upset the Trojans
twice or even once, the southern
team will be pretty nearly elimi
nated from the championship race,
since California is expected to cap
ture an easy brace of games from
U.C.L.A. at Berkeley this week-end.
An upset is one thing that Sam
Barry and his Trojans will be on
guard against, but at the same time
it is the one thing that Coach Bunn
and his crew would like nothing
better than to accomplish.
Hope for Surprise
Although S.C. is naturally fa
vored over the Indians because of
their potential strength and their
smashing defeat of California in the
second game of their series two
weeks ago, Stanford is rated as
quite capable of pulling a surprise.
Stanford's performance against
California last Saturday revealed
considerable strength in the Indian
lineup despite the fact that the
Bears carried off the honors. After
several weeks of experimenting,
Coach Bunn seemed to have hit
upon his strongest lineup.
Cowing Capable
Anderson and Topping at for
wards, Captain Edelen at center, and
Mallatratt and Rogers at guards
will probably again get the call
against S.C. tonight, with Emil Co
wing also seeing action at forward
opposite Topping. Though not very
tall, Cowing is a scrappy, capable
forward. In the second U.C.L.A.
game he carried off high point hon
ors for the evening with 11 digits
in spite of the fact that the Bruinp
won the contest.
Wytze Gorter, who has been used
at forward until the past week, has
been shifted to center, where his
height is expected to help uut when
ever Edelen is not in the game. A1
Hershey has been shifted from cen
ter to left forward to even things
up.
S.C. Has Power
To match whatever Stanford has
to offer, S.C. will have one of their
usual big, powerful starting lineups,
probably consisting of Contain Sax
Elliot and Ernie Holbrook at for
wards, Lee Guttero at center, and
Julie Besnos and "Barking Joe"
Kelly as guards.
Guttero, S.C's greatest scoring
threat, leads the conference in the
number of baskets tallied but will
find a capable competitor in the
person of Stanford's Keith Topping,
who shares runnerup scoring hon
ors with Hal Eilert. E;:ch team's
chances for victory depend on how
successfully they can bottle up the
other's chief scoring threat and on
whether they can spring loose their
own high scorer.

guard against, but at the same time
it is the one thing that Coach Bunn
and his crew would like nothing
better than to accomplish.
Hope for Surprise
Although S.C. is naturally fa
vored over the Indians because of
their potential strength and their
smashing defeat of California in the
second game of their series two
weeks ago, Stanford is rated as
quite capable of pulling a surprise.
Stanford's performance against
California last Saturday revealed
considerable strength in the Indian
lineup despite the fact that the
Bears carried off the honors. After
several weeks of experimenting,
Coach Bunn seemed to have hit
upon his strongest lineup.
Cowing Capable
Anderson and Topping at for
wards, Captain Edelen at center, and
Mallatratt and Rogers at guards
will probably again get the call
against S.C. tonight, with Emil Co
wing also seeing action at forward
opposite Topping. Though not very
tall, Cowing is a scrappy, capable
forward. In the second U.C.L.A.
game he carried off high point hon
ors for the evening with 11 digits
in spite of the fact that the Bruinp
won the contest.
Wytze Gorter, who has been used
at forward until the past week, has
been shifted to center, where his
height is expected to help uut when
ever Edelen is not in the game. A1
Hershey has been shifted from cen
ter to left forward to even things
up.
S.C. Has Power
To match whatever Stanford has
to offer, S.C. will have one of their
usual big, powerful starting lineups,
probably consisting of Contain Sax
Elliot and Ernie Holbrook at for
wards, Lee Guttero at center, and
Julie Besnos and "Barking Joe"
Kelly as guards.
Guttero, S.C's greatest scoring
threat, leads the conference in the
number of baskets tallied but will
find a capable competitor in the
person of Stanford's Keith Topping,
who shares runnerup scoring hon
ors with Hal Eilert. E;:ch team's
chances for victory depend on how
successfully they can bottle up the
other's chief scoring threat and on
whether they can spring loose their
own high scorer.
With the Trojans battling, for a
conference championship and Stan
ford struggling for a place in the
basketball sun, Coach Jo!m Bunn's
Indians will meet S.C. tonight and
tomorrow night at Los Angeles in
the first pair of their 1931 series of
games.
If Stanford can upset the Trojans
twice or even once, the southern
team will be pretty nearly elimi
nated from the championship race,
since California is expected to cap
ture an easy brace of games from
U.C.L.A. at Berkeley this week-end.
An upset is one thing that Sam
Barry and his Trojans will be on
guard against, but at the same time
it is the one thing that Coach Bunn
and his crew would like nothing
better than to accomplish.
