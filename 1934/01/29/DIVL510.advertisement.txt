Boy!
WASN'T THAT SOME
DEPRESSION!
However —
There is still more than a Billion Dollars a week
of spendable incomes.
The world isn't going to stop. People will con
tinue to labor, laugh, love, and live. Babies (we
are informed by statisticians) are being born at
the rate of 44 per minute right here in the good
old U.S.A.
In the meantime we must keep on keeping on.
Business will not improve for each of us until each
of us improves it.
We are going to carry on—to Success.
