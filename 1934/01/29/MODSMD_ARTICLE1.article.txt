## Price Juggling 
### 
Devaluation of the dollar, ex
pected to be accomplished by the
President's pen early tl is week,
will move the administration into a
ncvv experiment, international price
juggling.
Whether England and France will
prevent further weakening of the
dollar, as foreign exchange experts
believe they can, is th? question.
If not, can the two billion doliar
stabilization fund successfully keep
its value down in spite of foreign
counter-moves?
Further foreign complication is
offered by the political unrest in
France, which with the new Ameri
can Gold Policy could eu.'ily result
in toppling that country off the gold
standard.
