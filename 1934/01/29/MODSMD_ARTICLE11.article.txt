# San Quentin Beats Farm
## Trio of Indian Debaters Lose 2-1 Verdict 
### 
To San Quentin and to defeat
went the Stanford debate team Sun- j
day. On the San Quentin campus, |
just a stone's throw from con
demned row, the discussion on ;
whether the government should or
should not operate the railways
proceeded.
Stanford, represented by Spencer ;
Thompson, Bromley Smith, and Abe |
Mellinkoff, stood pat, declared for
continued private operation. Though
favoring further regulation, where
necessary the Farm lads, no doubt
remembering that Stanford is built
on railroad money, were not willing
to place the operation of a twenty
billion dollar enterprise in the hands
of Washington beaurocrats
San Quentin was well represented
by three university grauuates; too
well represented, perhaps if view of
the two to one decision that they
took from the Indian debaters.
The men from across ilv bay were
experienced speakers, well versed
in the railroad question. They
painted the horrible picture of a
vast industry woefully mismanaged,
r.nd tied to a debt that will not ma
ture within this century.
From Oxford, England, came the
leading San Quentin speaker. Years
of Hvde Park socialism, sometimes
speaking with Bernard Shaw, had
whetted his tongue sharp. His two
colleagues from Americnn univer
sities were not far behind in the
judges' estimation.
The lecture room was packed with
some 500 prison inmates, eager for
a sight at the outside world, and
most attentive to arguments from
both sides.
Dr. Shurder, head of the San
Quentin educational department
presided, introduced thu speakers,
judges, and the Stanford guests, Mr.
Lee Chapin, varsity debate coach,
and Mr. Lee Emerson Bpsset, head
of the Public Speaking Department.
