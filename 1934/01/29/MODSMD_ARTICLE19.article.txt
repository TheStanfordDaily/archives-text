## 
### CHARLOTTE BURRIDGE 
A typical mother is Miss Donal-
I dina Cameron, who for 37 years has
' played that part to Chinese girls in
! San Francisco. In spite her years
of strenuous, daring work in China
town, Miss Cameron has maintained
la vivacity and enthusiasm envied by
I many of less years who listened to
I her fascinating talk sponsored by
the Y.W.C.A. in the Women's Club
house yesterday afternoon.
Although she- loves, and is loved
i dearly by the Chinese girls, who
.call her "Lo Mo," mean : i:g mother,
| Miss Cameron has an unbiased out
look on the racial problem.
"I am not in favor of inter-mar
j riage with the Chinese," she stated
emphatically. "I think we can as
similate without inter-marriage."
| Miss Cameron does not epprove of
segregation of Chinese and Japanese
| hoys and {jirls 111 school, however,

"I think they should have equal
privileges with white children," she
said.
Chinatown's mother answers the
description of a typical mother.
Flu fly white hair frames her rosy
cheeked countenance which, though
bearing wrinkles of care and hard
ships, reflects the sweet, gentle
manner and the strong character of
this modern pioneer.
| "It has been such a joy to spend
my life rescuing Chinese lives," she
in her inspiring manner. "My
years of active service are over, so
1 am stepping back into tho shadows
and letting my splendid Chinese as
sistants carry on," she added with
a touch of sadness in her voice as
though secretly wishing lor another
four decades to spend saving help
less Chinese girls from cruel lives
of slavery.
