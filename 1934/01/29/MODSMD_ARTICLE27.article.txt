# INDIAN CAGERS UPSET DOPE IN WIN OVER S.C.
## Saturday Night Comeback Nets Stanford 35-31 Victory in L.A. FIRST IN TWO YEARS Trojans Win Friday Game By 36-24 Score 
### Charles Chappell 
Staging a determined second night
comeback, Coach John Burin's bas
ketball men stopped the vaunted
S.C. cage attack, bottled up the
highly-touted Lee Guttero, shook
loose their own heavy-scoring
sharp-shooters and defeated the
Trojans 35 to 31. in Los A 'geles Sat
urday, after having dropped the Fri
day night encounter 36 to 24.
Emulating their football brethren,
but without a single sopnomoro in
the lineup this time, the Stanford
cagers upset the dope considerably
by taking their first victory over
S.C. in two years, few experts hav
ing conceded them a chance over
the powerful Trojans.
Take Early Lead
Sweeping into an early lead be
fore the surprised S.C. five could
get its bearings, the Indians held the
advantage for the balance of the
game, leading at the half 17 to 13,
and at one lime clinging to a 10-
point margin over the trailing Tro
jans. The defeat shoved S.C. into
second place in the conference race.
The Olympic Auditorium in L'»s
Angeles, scene of many a knock
down and drag-out court struggle,
found itself the locale Saturday of
one of the roughest, toughest
pseudo-grid encounters in its his
tory. Despite the many .spills and
[collisions, only one player, Hol
brook, of S.C., went out of the game
on personal fouls.
Speedier Attack
Coach Bunn's much-publicized
"freedom offense," whicn ties the
players down to no hard and fast
set of plays, proved its superiority
over the slower Trojan attack by its
greater speed and flexibility. Arnie
Anderson, former Palo Alto star,
I fulfilled all predictions as to his
ability by netting six field goals and
j a free throw for 13 points 'md high
score honors.
