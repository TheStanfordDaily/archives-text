# SHERIFF EMIG SPEAKS HIS PIECE
## 
### 
The Crime of November 2<»th will no I fade from public
consciousness. The sheer horror of two men being taken
from (he custody of I lie law and hung to ;i Iree in San Jose
slill lingers.
But lest someone could forget this Mob Murder, Sheriff
Emig has broken long silence to further putrifv the air
with the sordid details of the affair.
The Sheriff admits that he disarmed his deputies when
the seething of the mob reached its peak. In short, just
when guns might have done something to stop the killing,
pacifist Emig moved to avert action. It is indeed hearten
ing to find such noble gentlemen leading our costahularv.
The Sheriff feared that he would have to "murder"
women and children to stop the mob. After all, who would
want to murder mothers and children? After all, mothers
are the mothers of the race and children are the children
of the race. Emig becomes a public benefactor!
If a mob of mothers and children were to decide that
Emig's office should be torn to bits, and maybe Emig as
well, what would he do? Would he refuse to exercise
force? Would he refrain from murdering mother and
(hildren? Noble Emig!
The worthy sheriff, and a mother-lover like Emig is
indeed worthy, no doubt knows th.nl a few blank shots
would have dispersed the mere spectators.
Those that refused to be dispersed could have been
shot. They were no longer peaceful citizens. They were
criminals attempting murder. Of course they had votes
and their friends had votes. And Emig loves mothers and
votes.
The situation becomes clarified. Sheriff Emig put those
two men in that rat-eaten jail and left them there with
nothing but the bare walls to protect them from that seeth
ing mob.
The deputies were there: one encouraged the mob to
come and gel them and another told the mob to say prayer
just before they dragged the men from their cells. That
was the total effective power of law administration in San
.lose on that night.
Of course, it was nice that prayer was said before the
hanging. We can thank Sheriff Emig for thai. And for
small favors, we must be thankful.
Hut as for Sheriff* Emig. He has definitely qualified
himself to be removed from iiis office. lie has shown that
he will use no force to save people whom the mob might
desire lo kill.

pacifist Emig moved to avert action. It is indeed hearten
ing to find such noble gentlemen leading our costahularv.
The Sheriff feared that he would have to "murder"
women and children to stop the mob. After all, who would
want to murder mothers and children? After all, mothers
are the mothers of the race and children are the children
of the race. Emig becomes a public benefactor!
If a mob of mothers and children were to decide that
Emig's office should be torn to bits, and maybe Emig as
well, what would he do? Would he refuse to exercise
force? Would he refrain from murdering mother and
(hildren? Noble Emig!
The worthy sheriff, and a mother-lover like Emig is
indeed worthy, no doubt knows th.nl a few blank shots
would have dispersed the mere spectators.
Those that refused to be dispersed could have been
shot. They were no longer peaceful citizens. They were
criminals attempting murder. Of course they had votes
and their friends had votes. And Emig loves mothers and
votes.
The situation becomes clarified. Sheriff Emig put those
two men in that rat-eaten jail and left them there with
nothing but the bare walls to protect them from that seeth
ing mob.
The deputies were there: one encouraged the mob to
come and gel them and another told the mob to say prayer
just before they dragged the men from their cells. That
was the total effective power of law administration in San
.lose on that night.
Of course, it was nice that prayer was said before the
hanging. We can thank Sheriff Emig for thai. And for
small favors, we must be thankful.
Hut as for Sheriff* Emig. He has definitely qualified
himself to be removed from iiis office. lie has shown that
he will use no force to save people whom the mob might
desire lo kill.
