We know flying is safe, infinitely safer no doubt than
walking, and if doesn't run down your rubber heels either!
II is comfortable hot and cold running water, food,

It is economical. It is much less expensive to fly from
San Francisco to Salt Lake City than it is to ship from Los

so sweet, think of us and keep your damned planes awav
from our Quad! If we must resort lo anti-aircraft we will.
We will. Yes, we will.
