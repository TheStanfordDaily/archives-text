During the lust 15 years Williams'
experiences have led him into unique
situations, such as in 1919, when as
vice-president of a Cleveland steel
company and needing information
about his workers, he changed his
name, put on overalls, and became
a journeyman laboi'er in American
mines and factories. His report of
"What's on Ihe Worker's Mind" re
ceived wide acclaim.
Since that time, he has worked in
coal mines and steel mi!':; of Brit
ain, northern France, thÂ»> Ruhr and
Saar Valleys of Germany, and vis
ited Russia's "Pittsburgh District" in
Ihe Ukraine. While in Russia he
secured, without the aid of an in
terpreter, the lrank attitude of the
coal miners and steel workers to
ward their Red masters.
