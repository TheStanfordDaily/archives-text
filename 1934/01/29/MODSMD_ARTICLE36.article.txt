## RELIEF VIA ATHLETICS PLUS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I don't really know why I'm vent
ing this letter to you, when it's the
student relief committee that should
be most interested.
That Saturday's rugby was
pretty much of a washout as far as
earning money for charity goes, I
believe is evident. The reason is
that many students don't care for,
or don't care to learn about rugby.
Why not enlarge the field of enter
tainment? .
My suggestion is an all-day ath
letic Day for Charity. In the morn
ing golf and tennis could be played;
both would draw a few early risers,
I think. In the afternoon rugby,
baseball, and water polo could pro
vide entertainment. And then in the
evening a double-header program of
basketball and possibly a little box
ing or wrestling would top the pro
gram.
For the enthusiastic spectator who
wants to see all there is to be seen,
an all-event ticket could be sold.
And for the less single
ducats good for one sport.
With these simple suggertions of
sport for charity, I am,
Sincerely,
B Kellogg
