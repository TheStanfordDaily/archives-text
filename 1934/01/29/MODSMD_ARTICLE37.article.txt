# THE 						PEOPLE V. WALTMAN

### 
The Editor, Sir:
I noticed from your reliable news
paper that the eminent Sir William
DeWitt Waltman, D.C., authority par
excellence on the arts of hashing
and correct etiquette, and the alti
tude of humble servants toward
their noble masters, has recently
come into our beloved farming com
munity. In fact, one would gather
from the same report 'that he has
just honored the lowly "Cellar" with
one of his rare slumming tours—
only to have his dainty stomach
turned by the gross negligence and
indifference of the waiters.
I've regularly eaten at l'ie Cellar.
I think the student hashers r.re very
efficient and considerate —and for
that reason fuily believe 4 hat had
they known of his visit they would
have rendered him all due homage
and service. The boys rre very
eager to do their best—an J always
appreciate constructive criticism.
Why not, Mr. Editor, use your in
fluence in inviting the cultured
gentleman to one of thei.- regular
pep rallies to speak as tho guest of
honor on the subject "Etiquette and
Servility While Hashing." I'm sure
the boys would welcome him.
Yours, Wes Mullcr.
