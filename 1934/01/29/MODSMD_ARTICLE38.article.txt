Editor, the Daily, Sir:
As frequenters of the Union Cel

lar, our powers of restraint have
been exhausted. We feci duty
bound to express a few of our own
sentiments.
We are at a loss to understand the
attitude assumed by the "Great Un
known" to wil: DeWitt Waltman
(Bill to you, sir). Apparently Bill
(Mister Waltman) wrote his master
piece with the idea of offering some
good, constructive criticirm. This
feat is born out by his fluent use of
both slang and profanity. (Yet,
maybe that is his idea of being
helpful).
It is, and always has Veen, our
observation that the spirit displayed
by the waiters in the Cellar has
been one of helpfulness, service, and
good-fellowship—as it should be,
Mr. Editor.
If Bill (Mr. Waltman, or rather
Mr. DeWitt Waltman) has not
grounded himself sufficiently on the
elements of grammar and the spirit
of tho institutions of our beloved
school, the writers can make but
four suggestions, namely: a diction
ary, a can of coffee (he may not
j spill it in his saucer), a camp stove,
and last but not least, THE HILLS.
Very truly yours.
