ROMAN SjANDALS
(United Artists)
At the California Theatre
I Regarding musical movior-, it is by
I now a case of either you do or you
J aon't, and ;t simply happened I don't.
But you may, and if . c <\ this will
i appeal; for it is certainly one of the
; best of the still-raging epidemic of
! film musicals (or filmuricals) (or
filmsicals, etc.). It has all the usual
; impedimenta, plus EdJi? Cantor,
i who is responsible for whatever dls
| tinction the film merits.
Cantor does an-lowa-Ysnkee-in
! Kinfc Valerius'-court, without reiy
j ing too heavily on the humorous
| anachronisms that com? from the
j "turn back clock" typo of picture.
; Once back in Rome, he m. nages his
I own brand of very goo~l comedy
I with line results.
Most of the humor of the film cen
ters around Cantor's appointment as
food-taster to the empcior, which
I job he finds peculiarly distasteful
when he hears of the empresses's
i plot to poison her spou.se. Other
j high spots of comedy are the laugh
■ ing scene in the dungec.p and the
| hilarious chariot-chase finish.
Not only neat but also paudy are
' the musical numbers, of which there
lis the accepted quota. Two of them
are well-handled by Mr. Cantor,
("Keep Young and Beav.liful" and
| "Build a Little Home," but unfor
; tunately they get out of his hands
I and into those of the danco director,
! who does not seem to lfalize that
; there is a point beyond which there
! is no whicher.
I A third number, well sung by
| Ruth Etting, also gets out of hand,
I what with countless chorus girls
| wearing nothing but long wigs and
I pained expressions.
All the players are meroly stooges
I for the star, but of those Alpn Mow
j bray and Edward Arnold take the
worst beating, while Dav-i Manners
I and Gloria Stuart provide a modi
cum of love interest. —Chapin.
