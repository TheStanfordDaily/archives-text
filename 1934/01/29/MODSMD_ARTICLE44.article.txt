## 
### 
They maintained their league
; lead, and they proved they had ca
j pable varsity reserves.
Those were the two main accom
! plishments of tho Stanford water
; polo players as they finished strong
i to trounce the Athens Club poloists
I in the first 1934 encounter in the
j Northern California Water Polo
[League at the Encina pools Satur
i day afternoon.
The final score favored Stanford,
i 0 to 4.
Showing clever team wovk, Stan
ford started rather indifferently, and
| finally got the range to rink five
straight goals in the last hrlf.
Fully as much as the victory,
1 Coach Nort Thornton appreciated
the showing made by two reserves,
j Paul dcSilva and Jack Murietta.
i These two, playing in their first
! game this season, were called upon
j at the last minute to replace regu
| lars who were incapacitated because
! of colds. deSilva started in Bob Fos
j ter's position; the first siring for

i ward saw some action late in the
tilt. Murietta relieved Waily Wiget
and Captain Gordy Graves in the
guard pasts; Wiget and Graves were
just recovering from colds.
For the first half and early stages
of the second period, the game was
nip and tuck. Stanford Scored first
when Vlad Taranik looped a shot
into the cage.
The Athenians evened the score as
Jim MacKay pounded the ball
across for a score from close in.
Then the Cardinal rally started.
Taranik made a clever Â«hot from
far out. He then accepted a bad
pass from an Athenian rnd tossed
the ball from behind the i>nter line;
it glanced off the chest of Benet,
who was given credit for the sixth
Indian score. Benet then slammed
the ball into the cage from the side,
! and deSilva executed an overhead
shot from the side of the pool for
two more tallies.
Showing good teamwork the Car
dinal frosh defeated the A hens Re
serves, 4 to 1, in a preliminary game.
