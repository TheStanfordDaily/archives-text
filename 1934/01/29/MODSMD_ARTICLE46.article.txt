### Mort D'Evelyn 
By sneaking a nip-and-tuck battle
with the St. Mary's frosh out of the
coals with a last second bucket to
win 27-26, and by easily outclassing
Stockton High 29-12, Jimmy Brad
shaw's frosh five made tilt. best of
the week-end by adding two more
wins to their long string of victo
ries.
Friday night's battle whs- one of
those torrid tussles that are sup
' posed to occur only in novels. Cli
maxing a see-saw last half, Card
Howell Turner leaped toward the
bucket with the winning tally as the
time-keeper raised his pis.ol for the
closing .shot, and dropped in the im
portant two points just a f, action of
;> second before the gun brrked.
Defense Improved
St. Mary's and the frosh were
two first-class basketb-ill teams
playing way below par but making
a whale of a scrap out 3!' it. The
Gael shots were popping out of the
bucket. Stanford's pa.ssin.j wa.s poor,
and the Babes would sink only one
out of 1G free throws. On the other
hand the Stanford defense was
greatly improved, forcing lhe visi
tors to be satisfied with shots from
the side or outside the horn.
After grabbing an earlv 10-3 lead
the Cards slumped while Nelson and
Petri rang the hoop for the Gaels
to give the Moraga quinici a 15-12
lead at half time. Six times in the
second half the lead changed hands.
With three minutes left to play
Stanford had a 3-point lead. Rigler
broke away for a set-up and Nel
son swished two more for the Gaels.
Last Minute Tally
Two minutes to go and the Card
frosh were down three big points.
Moore finally got control o r the ball
in a melee under the bucket and
pushed in a tally.
One minute to go and one point
behind. The Gael Babe> took 'the
offensive and forced the ball into
Card territory. Stanford's >ut in the
far corner. Turner broke for the
bucket as the gun went up. Beedle
picked out Turner, and lobbed him
a long pass that reached the for
ward just under the hoop. Giannoni
crashed Turner, but the labor's hook
shot dropped through with the win
ning points as the gun want oil.
Turner Stars
Saturday night Stocktcn High's
only show was in getting tne tip-oIT,
which they did consistently through
the efforts of a slim, spring colored
center, Fields. The first iialf found
the Babe seconds on the floor, and
both teams so evenly matched that
little scoring resulted, tne period
closing at 10-3. Turner, Beedle, and
Schott quickly rolled up points
when the first string got 011 the
floor. Turner slipped away from
the Tarzan guards for th.'ee more
set-ups to add to his five of the
night before.
High point honors for i'le week
end also went to Tumor, who ac
counted for 10 digits e-ich night.
Schott scored seven against the
Gaels and two at the expense of
Stockton to follow Turner, while
Moore's six Friday night made him
third high scorer.
