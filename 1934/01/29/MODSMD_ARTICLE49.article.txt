# Card Polo Men Stampede Monterey in First Game
## 
### 
; Starting off their 1934 season,
J Stanford's polo team stamped itself
| Friday afternoon as being one of
I the most powerful, potentially at
; least, of any quartet in Farm history
! by defeating a team from the Mun
! terey Presidio 17 to 1.
Although the comparatively inex
! perienced Monterey team furnished
I little competition by which to judge
! the Indians, Captain Gordans' riders
gave promise of developing into a
smooth, championship to mi before
;the end of ihe season.
j With Russell Rasmussei and Bob;
! Fullerton, former Culver Military
; Academy polo stars, filling first
i string berths, the veterans Luppe
jLuppen and Bill Rogers completed I
jthe rest of the quartet. i
