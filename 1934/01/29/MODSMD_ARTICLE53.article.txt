# BASEBALL SQUAD TO OPEN REGULAR SEASON SATURDAY
## 
### Chuck Clancy 
With a full .squad in good condi
tion reporting for practice '.his after
noon, Couch Harry Wo'ter will
settle down for a week of intensive
work whipping the Stanford varsity
ba.seball team into shape for the
fir.st official ga ne of'the cmson Sat
urday against the strong Athens
Club team of Oakland.
Wednesday's practice lilt against
San Jose State tended '<> confirm
previous calculations as to the
strengths and weaknesses of the
1934 edition of the Card varsity.
Good Pitching
Stanford has pitching ; nd hitting
strength this year—two vital req
uisites of a successful ba'l club. The
showing of Anderson, Campbell,
and Herringer against the Spartans,
when they allowed only three hits
between them, proves convincingly
that they will win games this year,
providing of course, that they get
decent support from their team
mates on the field. S •nmelroth,
Ivory, and Blanchard ;.re three
twirlers who will round out a nicely
balanced pitching staff.
The fact that Stanford collected
12 bingles against the San Jose
Staters is no accurate measurement
of the Card hitting strength.
Steady Infield
The infield played unusually
iteady baseball considering the early
date. The one glaring weakness be
ing at shortstop, as predicted, where
Clark and Edwards worked. Both
boys have displayed raal natural
ability both on the diamond and at
the plate in practice, but due to in
experience they were nervous and
over-anxious in their fielding and
batting efforts Wednesday.
Frank Tremaine, who played third
base throughout the game showed
that he will give Tratunu n a run
for the regular berth. The play of
Bob Sevinske and Art Hearn, at
second and first, respectively, was
flawless.
