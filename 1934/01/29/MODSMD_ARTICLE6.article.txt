Enmity, rumored to have existed
for many years between Stalin and
the widow of Lenin, former Soviet
leader, seems to have disappeared.
Known as Krupskaya, the woman
sat with Stalin on the Presidium,
ruling body of the All-Union party
Congress now in session, and she in
turn praised Stalin highly in a
speech.
