# DISTANT DRUMS SEATS GO FAST
## Four P.A. Children Are Added to Cast 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
With an even larger fir.-t.-day seat
sale than greeted the spectacular
"Arms and the Man,"' and with re
hearsals going forward smoothly,
Friday night's "Distant Drums"
looms as an assured financial as well
as artistic milestone.
The numerous interesting quali
ties which are combined in this epic
drama account partially for the
] early rush for seats.
Its author, Dan Tothu'oh, is a
j native Californian and was thus
| able to imbue his drama with a
I genuine Western flavor which is
being ably captured in Helvenston's
i pi'oduction. The play contains ex
citement, romance, comedy, adven
ture, and such surefire elements—
jso that the Assembly H-jll should
[ find a large and satisfied house on
I Friday night.
I
The high quality of the cast is
| another attraction, with such estab
| fished names as James Bcnet, Carter
I Meyar, and Paul Crary, and such
i promising ones as Kav Arthur,
I Sherman McFedfies, and Shelley
Smith on the roster.
Last night Helvenston announced
j the addition to his cast of four in
teresting children players who prom
ise to add much color and atmos
■ phere to the production. Lloyd and
Waldron Wilson are well known to
j campus audiences, especially for
, roles in "An Enemy of the People";
in the current cpus they appear as
! members of the pioneer tiain, as do
I small Ann Bossinger and Ann
' Wortman.

j U.S.C. has more campus organi
i zations than any other university in
i America.
