## Future Economic Majors To Be Advised 
### 
Advice to future economic majors
will be given by Professor Bernard
F. Haley, executive head of the de
partment, tomorrow night at 7
o'clock in the Little Theatre.
This is the second in a series of
lectures which is intended to assist
lower division students in the se
lection of a major. Th.2 first was
given by Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur.
Half of the hourly period will be
devoted to questions raised from the
floor by inquiring students. Haley
emphasizes the necessity of students
who plan to major in economics to
become oriented to the requirements
of that department.
Economics majors at {he present
time number 153 for thfo quarter,
according to the Bawl-out, a drop
in enrollment from last >car. This
drop, explained Haley, is caused by
the growth of the Polilieai Science
Department and the increased num
ber of majors in Social Science.
