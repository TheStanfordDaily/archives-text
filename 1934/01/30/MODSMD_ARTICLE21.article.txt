# S.S. Toyon Bids Ready, "Sea-Legs" Band Wanted
## 
### 
Ducats fresh off the presses last
night avowedly "good for one pas
sage" on the S.S. Toyon, sailing from
the campus a week from Friday
night, February !), are available in
the A.S.S.U. offices of th'j Old Union
today at a new low standard of $3
for Toyon's annual whiter formal
event.
Meanwhile, committer members
declared that final arrangements
wilh a prominent orchestra are
being concluded today. One of the
leading aggregations out for the job
was forced to drop out of competi
tion yesterday after a beat trip
when nine of the ten musicians
found that they didn't have "sea
legs" and can't make the trip with
Toyon's revelers.
