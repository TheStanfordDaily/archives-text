# Williams, Research Tramp, to Lecture On Soviet Workers
## Lecture in Assembly Hall Tonight Will Reveal Laborers' View 
### Will Williams 
From the salon of a d_> luxe liner
as a first-class passenger to the
boiler-room as a stoker; from the
docks of London as a jooless sailor
to the American Embassy as guest;
from White House luncheon to
Bonus Army riot; from eating with
workers in Berlin's reddest slums to
tea-ing at the aristocratic Hotel Ad
lon—such has been the slightly
garbled career of Whiting Williams,
who speaks tonight at 7*30 o'clock
in the Assembly Hall o*l "What's
on the Russian Worker's Mind."
In July, 1933, Williams packed
two portmanteaux—one containing a
tuxedo and patent leathers, the
other overalls and denim shirts—and
went over to learn what his fellow
laborers as well as government offi
cials and "the man in the street" in
Russia and Germany think of Com
munism, Hitlerism, the alleged ill
treatment of the German Jews, and
other timely and vital questions. 111
all this he was able to see with eyes
and listen with ears trained by a
long and unique experience.
Oberlin Graduate
He received his A.B. fiom Ober
lin in 1899 and his Mast -.'s in 1909.
From 1904 to J912 he was assistant
to the president of Oberlin College
and later went to Cleveland as di
rector of the Welfare Federation.
Then he had his first taste in the
industrial world when lie went to
the Cleveland Hydraulic Steel Com
pany as vice-president in charge of
personnel. He discovered many
stumbling - blocks, howr.ver, be
cause he knew so little about the
steel workers' actual problems and
difficulties. He decided that there
was just one thing to do—go out
and discover for himself what kind
of life the worker led.
Is Worker's Friemi
Williams has never had any trou
ble in making the workers believe
that he is one of them. In the first
place, there have bee a so many
types of men who since the war
have had to take any kind of a job,
that no one notices a woiker with
uncalloused hands. Then, too, Wil
liams finds that it is fa>: easier to
slip down to their conveisation and
language than to pull himself out
into a world of correct grammar
and mild profanity.
After living his double life, Mr.
Williams wrote many reports for
leading national magazines, Satur
day Evening Post, Collier's, Scrib
ner's, New York Times, Survey
Graphic, and many othcis. He is
the author of many best-selling
books, including "What':: on the
Worker's Mind," "Full Up and Fed
Up," "Horny Hands and Hampered
Elbows, "Mainsprings of Men."
