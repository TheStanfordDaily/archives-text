# Memorial Chapel Chosen For Cover of Yearbook
## 
### 
Already on postcards, canvas, and
tapestry, the Stanford Memorial
Chapel will appear in a new role
when it becomes the central design
for the cover of the 1934 Quad.
Against the background of sand
stone, embossed in 1 ather, the
Chapel, its rich colors softened, will
be portrayed as it is seen through
the middle arch of the inner quad.
Van Allen Haven is iho artist who
designed the cover which Editor Al
Sadler feels confident will enclose
one of the best Quads in Stanford
history. Although the yearbook will
not be bound by any distinct motif,
its art work will emphasize the
arches which are the fundamentals
of the University's architecture.
Arches will be a fealiue of the

end section design, whieh is par- j
ticulerly colorful for tlus volume, i
and of the various sketches for the I
sections.
Unusual photographs of familiar I
campus scenery will also bt_ part of j
the artistry that will be found in the |
1934 Quad. Using a special chemical |
treatment, Photographer Goor go j
Waters has produced pictures that
give the cffcct of night scenes with
striking, almost ethereal, illumina- '
tion.
A new note in Quad production 1
will be the use of different type for
the written material. Believing the [
written part of the Quad less essen- j
tial than the photographs, Sadler !
plans tii have about 275 voids l<> a |
page instead of the usual 450.
