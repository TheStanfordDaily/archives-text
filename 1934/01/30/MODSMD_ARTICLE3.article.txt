Secretary of Treasury under Hoo
ver. Ogden L. Mills last night made
a vigorous speech in Topcka, Kan
sas, which was seen as & hid for
G.O.P. presidential nomination in
1936.
Attacking F.R.'s recovery program
in general, he cited worst features:
centralization of power in hands of
executive, money maneuvering,
."overnment's asserted attempt to
regulate daily life of citizens, dire
results of possible perinanization of
farm relief.
