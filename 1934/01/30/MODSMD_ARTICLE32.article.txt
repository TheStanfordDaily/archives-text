We do not believe Itoal where there is smoke there is
always lire. Very often, inspection discovers nothing any
wanner than some over-heated smoke-hlowcrs, very red
in the face (when discovered) and blowing like furies.
Investigation, however, is tlie only way to sift the
smoke from the fire. That is why the Executive Commit
tee will meet tonight to untangle the football manager
problem. There has,been much talk casting sinister
clouds over the "whole affair; the clouds must he lifted
or Ihe Executive Committee cannot ratify the appoint
ment.
There are some namby-pambies that would rush
through the ratification just because the H.A.C. has indi
cated its choice. Hut there are always some who lack the
spine !o take the difficult course, would rather bow and
scrape to what looks like a big tin god.
Generally, the Executive Committee, however, is de
termined to exercise its power of approval with some
sane consideration. The Campus can help by attending
Ihe meeting tonight in the Old Union —or at least any
members of the student body who know any of the lurid
details or who know that the details are not lurid at all.
President Trautman has requested that Senior Man
ager Robert Saxe, the junior managers, and the sopho
more managers be present to aid the discussion.
There has been some rumor that Manager Saxe and
others would not attend. This can only be Ihe most idle
sort of talk, for if S<ixe would not appear to explain his
own choice for the position, the inferences that might be
drawn would be disastrous. Mr. Saxe is under moral ob
ligation to attend Ihe meeting and bring bis ratings with
him. If he doesn't, the President of Ihe tniversity could
compel him.

liitl il is needless to enumerate the legal possibilities,
ll would be purest folly for those who know the most to
stay away. Everyone is positive that they will come and
aid in dispelling Ihe little clouds of doubt that have arisen.
There has also been rumor of what will happen to foot
ball managerships should the Executive Committee act in
a constitutional manner. These rumors are probably also
woven out of thin air. *Bul though they were, they should
frighten no one. The Executive Committee should act hon
estly. Thai should be Ihe only consideration.
Those that seek to frighten the Ex Committee by child
ish threats or those that might act equally childish by re
fusing to attend are per se acting childishly and of course
will be treated accordingly.

Ihe meeting tonight in the Old Union —or at least any
members of the student body who know any of the lurid
details or who know that the details are not lurid at all.
President Trautman has requested that Senior Man
ager Robert Saxe, the junior managers, and the sopho
more managers be present to aid the discussion.
There has been some rumor that Manager Saxe and
others would not attend. This can only be Ihe most idle
sort of talk, for if S<ixe would not appear to explain his
own choice for the position, the inferences that might be
drawn would be disastrous. Mr. Saxe is under moral ob
ligation to attend Ihe meeting and bring bis ratings with
him. If he doesn't, the President of Ihe tniversity could
compel him.

liitl il is needless to enumerate the legal possibilities,
ll would be purest folly for those who know the most to
stay away. Everyone is positive that they will come and
aid in dispelling Ihe little clouds of doubt that have arisen.
There has also been rumor of what will happen to foot
ball managerships should the Executive Committee act in
a constitutional manner. These rumors are probably also
woven out of thin air. *Bul though they were, they should
frighten no one. The Executive Committee should act hon
estly. Thai should be Ihe only consideration.
Those that seek to frighten the Ex Committee by child
ish threats or those that might act equally childish by re
fusing to attend are per se acting childishly and of course
will be treated accordingly.
We do not believe Itoal where there is smoke there is
always lire. Very often, inspection discovers nothing any
wanner than some over-heated smoke-hlowcrs, very red
in the face (when discovered) and blowing like furies.
Investigation, however, is tlie only way to sift the
smoke from the fire. That is why the Executive Commit
tee will meet tonight to untangle the football manager
problem. There has,been much talk casting sinister
clouds over the "whole affair; the clouds must he lifted
or Ihe Executive Committee cannot ratify the appoint
ment.
There are some namby-pambies that would rush
through the ratification just because the H.A.C. has indi
cated its choice. Hut there are always some who lack the
spine !o take the difficult course, would rather bow and
scrape to what looks like a big tin god.
Generally, the Executive Committee, however, is de
termined to exercise its power of approval with some
sane consideration. The Campus can help by attending
Ihe meeting tonight in the Old Union —or at least any
members of the student body who know any of the lurid
details or who know that the details are not lurid at all.
