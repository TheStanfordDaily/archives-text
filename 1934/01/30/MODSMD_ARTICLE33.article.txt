# Professors Are Practically Human
## 
### 
There is a wide-spread notion Ihat American professors
are absent-minded, impractical, and inclined to be wool
gathering theorists who leave for class each morning after
slamming their wives and kissing the door goodbye.
We feel that there is a good deal of injustice in this
prevailing attitude. They are really pretty orthodox souls,
who have no fault except that they are so ultra-respectable
in appearance that the public suspects that there must be
something stupid about them.
liecent graduates (who have found that conquering the
world, or even getting a job, is not as easy as it appears)
probably realize that il takes a smart man to see that
â€¢$.")()00 a year, a highly honored social position, and life
in an easy-going, congenial community is worth the few
hours of lecturing il costs, even it" there is little chance of
becoming rich or famous.
Poor Rabbitts. II must appear to them in the last few
years that I lie professors aren't so dumb. They don't shine
very much when the country is prosperous, but in the hist
couple of years they've shown Ihat life is pleasant even
without Cadillacs, butlers, and inlaved gold bathrooms.
