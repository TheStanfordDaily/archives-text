# The 						Rally Committee Still Thinks
## 
### 
Last week, we cast restraint to the winds and broke
for 111 in sweet undulating sentences of raptured praise in
re the Rally Committee. We accused them of thinking, of
which there can be no higher nor finer.
As some may well remember, the Rally Committee had
thought about card stunts, had then appointed a commit
tee to talk the mailer over with B.A.C. officials. The Daily
was breathless with anticipation. What would happen?
We are slill breathless. Nothing has happened.
One thing is indicated. The Daily lias twice requested
expression of student opinion. Today, we print the first
sign of student interest on the question. If the students
don't care, if the Rally Committee Chairman admits the
poor spectacle offered by Ihe'stunls, why doesn't the Rally
Committee whoop up enough stamina to come out and
advocate abolition of the stunts? The Campus waits with
the Daily. We wail.
