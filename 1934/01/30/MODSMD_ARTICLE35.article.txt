# 'Free-Wing' Plane Shows Promise

### 

Eighteen years of research and experiments are embodied in the
"free-wing" monoplane pictured above with its young designer and
builder, Wilbur Cornelius of Los Angeles. The plane embraces radical
departures from conventional airplane design in that its wings, in
stead of being stationary, move on an axis from the center of the lift.
The plane is said to be foolproof and impossible to "stall or spin."
