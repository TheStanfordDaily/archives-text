# BULL SESSION
## LETS BE EXCLUSIVE 
### 
With newspaper bombs already
bursting on the Russt-Japanese
frontier, and war being freely pre
dicted for every year from 1934 to
the millennium, we may as well
decide just where we arj going to
be when the fatal day arrives. Of
course, what if the whistles blow at
12 o'clock today, and c xtras an
nounce that war has been declared
between Russia and Japrm, France
and Germany, Germany mid Russia,
Or vice versa?
What will America do? Or what is
more important, what should Uncle
Sam and Cousin Franklin do?
If the war is in the Eart, William
Randolph Hearst, who unlike the
common bull, grows more alarmed
at Yellow than at Red, will urge
America to safeguard herself from
the danger of chopsticks, rice, and
cheap Japanese labor. United States
and Bethlehem Steel Corporations,
both of whom learned 16 years ago
that war does pay, won id join the
bloody alliance. And the country
would undoubtedly sooi discover
that its leaders in pear? were not
adverse to being let into war—pro
viding that there were patriots to do
the fighting, mills to do the manu
facturing, and governments to aid
in the profiteering.
Unfortunately, isolationists in

pcace becomes rabid internation
alists when the war dogs begin to
howl, and Baldwin Locomotive be
gins to rise. But the millions of
Americans, who have neither isola
tionist nor internationalist mentali
ties, but who have bodies with
which to fight, must know that while
co-operation is good when the skies
are blue, Intelligent Isolation Is the
only wartime policy that will avoid
a broken heart.
But what of the glory oC the flag?
What of freedom of the seas? What
of American commerce? it is a very
stupid and faithless flag which must
spend thousands of live*; and bil
lions of dollars to keep the lanes of
commerce open to a few industrial
ists. The mass of the people who
have lives and taxes to lose, ought
to realize that, so far as they are
concerned, entering a vcr is like
spending $10,000 to recover 10 cents.
America, richest nation in the
world, can, if she wills, be eco
nomically self-sustaining for a very

long period of time. In the halcyon
days she can afford to promote peace
and commerce all over the world. ;
But when hell begins to pop, only a |
moronic turtle would refuse to use J
its shell. Always ready t.» resist at
tack, never ready to attark—Amer
ica can be smart.
Where will we be when the next I
war comes? Mixing it up with Japa
nese, Germans, and gas bombs, or
sitting at home—at least living.

With newspaper bombs already
bursting on the Russt-Japanese
frontier, and war being freely pre
dicted for every year from 1934 to
the millennium, we may as well
decide just where we arj going to
be when the fatal day arrives. Of
course, what if the whistles blow at
12 o'clock today, and c xtras an
nounce that war has been declared
between Russia and Japrm, France
and Germany, Germany mid Russia,
Or vice versa?
What will America do? Or what is
more important, what should Uncle
Sam and Cousin Franklin do?
If the war is in the Eart, William
Randolph Hearst, who unlike the
common bull, grows more alarmed
at Yellow than at Red, will urge
America to safeguard herself from
the danger of chopsticks, rice, and
cheap Japanese labor. United States
and Bethlehem Steel Corporations,
both of whom learned 16 years ago
that war does pay, won id join the
bloody alliance. And the country
would undoubtedly sooi discover
that its leaders in pear? were not
adverse to being let into war—pro

the fighting, mills to do the manu
facturing, and governments to aid
in the profiteering.
