"Footlight Parade" is the latest
I product of the heat-oppressed brains
: of the Brothers Warner, and is the
| Frankenstein of all music is—and as
I such should hardly lie d'smissed in
j a mere paragraph. And yet tf you
| should see it, you can understand
I any reviewer's urge to d; just that.
If your constitution is hardy, you
: may view cute, cute Ruby Keeler,
' Dick Powell, James Carney, Guy
j Kibbee, and hundreds —uay, thou
| sancls—of others.
Along with this opus magnus is
; one of the most interesting films I
j have ever seen—one which is alone
well worth tho price of remission.
"Krakatoa" is a fine pictorial and
: narrative account of th ■ Krakatoa
volcanic disturbances oi' a few years
back, made in a presumably accu
! rate and certainly unsensational
manner.
The photography is Turning short
jof amazing, and with it is some
splendid sound work. Th } narrative
j story of the holocaust, which accom
! panics the film, is told i.i a lively
and interesting manner—the whole
combining to make it a memorably
' unique account of a memorably
I unique event. —Chapin

Marion Davies is no dancer and j
not much of a singer. She spends j
most of her time —in th-> film—look
ing spirituelle, and, surrounded by j
a cast of comedians, she f peaks not!
a single funny line hersell. Clever J
casting gave the role <>f Davies' ;
temperamental rival to small, ugly i
Fill D'Orsay, almost her only infe- j
rior in beauty, song, and dance.
Weak-willed, vague-l\.ced Bing !
Crosby is hampered in t<is singing!
by fast expresses and downtown ;
traffic speeding across his face. It
is all an effort to interpret the words

of his songs by means of double ex
posure. 'I he same method is val- j
iantly used to represent a dream, a
train trip, and the spirit of Holly
wood, but the berserkness of it all
! is disturbing.
The plot is formula 3, special mix
ture for man with voice. Girl falls
(consecutively for voice, man, movies.
| She takes the star's place (a) in the
i musical li!m, (b) in Crosby's heart.
: Her love redeems Crosby from
' D'Orsay and drink. Spectacle film.
Earnest Stuart Erwin and glum
i Ned Sparks contribute tlif ir stand- !
i ard type comedy. Patsy Kelly and
Sterling Holloway are funnies with j
fewer opportunities.
The film might have been good: j
j (1) if Crosby could mutch an ex- j
j cellent voice with a little strength!
of character rather than only spine
| less passivity, (2). if Davics had been
| allowed to clown, (3) if chorus rou
j tines had approached th * cleverness I
jof the music—After Sund »wn, We'll'
i Make Hay, and Temptation, (4) if
! good dialogue had bolstered the old 1
| plot, (5) if there had been more in- ,
jgenuity in the scenario and less trick |
j photography and costumes.
j The shorts; a Loony Time cartoon,
| animated but still dead; and a Char- ,

j new gags. —Brauns

Marion Davies is no dancer and j
not much of a singer. She spends j
most of her time —in th-> film—look
ing spirituelle, and, surrounded by j
a cast of comedians, she f peaks not!
a single funny line hersell. Clever J
casting gave the role <>f Davies' ;
temperamental rival to small, ugly i
Fill D'Orsay, almost her only infe- j
rior in beauty, song, and dance.
Weak-willed, vague-l\.ced Bing !
Crosby is hampered in t<is singing!
by fast expresses and downtown ;
traffic speeding across his face. It
is all an effort to interpret the words

of his songs by means of double ex
posure. 'I he same method is val- j
iantly used to represent a dream, a
train trip, and the spirit of Holly
wood, but the berserkness of it all
! is disturbing.
The plot is formula 3, special mix
ture for man with voice. Girl falls
(consecutively for voice, man, movies.
| She takes the star's place (a) in the
i musical li!m, (b) in Crosby's heart.
: Her love redeems Crosby from
' D'Orsay and drink. Spectacle film.
