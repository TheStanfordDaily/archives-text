■win u this season. With the |
exception of a few. spurtj, Stanford j
has not looked very impressive in |
the North, but they must have j

best games there, defeating U.C.L.A. !
and U.S.C. one game apieo and los- j
ing another game to the Bruins by j
only one point.

night, but if they continue the form j
Ihey displayed Saturday n : ght. Stan- j
ford is nobody's pushover.
Batmale and Keefe, U.S.F. guards, j
have built up quite a reputation for j
themselves as fine defensive play- i
ers and will probably start tonight.!
Little Happy Chambers and Joe |
Kineannon will get the call as for- ;
wards and either Mohr or Murphy j
will be at center.
Coach John Bunn was undecided |
last night as to his opening lineup j
but will probably start his first- |
string players. However, Captain ]
Hal Edelen, who had trouble with a ;
bad knee following the U.S.C. se- !
l ies, and Gordon Mallatratt with a '
minor foot infraction, may be given
a rest to keep them in shape for the
California game Saturday night.
