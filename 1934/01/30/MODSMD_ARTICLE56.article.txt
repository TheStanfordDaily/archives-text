# KAUFMAN SATIRE READING TRYOUTS WILL BE TONIGHT
## 
### James Sandoe 
As its nineteenth rue. ding un
effete, sincere Sword and Sandals
will present "Let Em Fat Cake, : '
sequel to the Pulitzer Prize musical
.satire "Of Thee I Sing." Mr. George
S. Kaufman, perhaps America's most
important collaborator, anil part au
thor of such plays as "Beggar on
Horseback," "Dinner at Eight," "The
Royal Family," and "Dulcy," has
extended his kind personal permis
sion to the organization for the
reading.
Because Sword and Sandals wishes
to encourage new and untried cam
pus talent, tryouts for parts in the
reading have been announced. Open
to all interested, the tryouts will be
held this evening at 7:3;) o'clock in
the Little Theatre. James Benet,
who has directed last quarter's read
ing of "Hay Fever," will be in
charge.
The cast is large, includes nearly
a dozen women and more men.
Among the characters pre several
who are well remembered from
"Of Thee I Sing," including Presi
dent Wintergreen, his wife, Mary
Love Wintergreen, and Vice-Presi
dent Alexander Thro'tlebottom.
Contrary to popular tradition none
of these roles has yet b2M cast.
This reading has been selected in
accordance with Sword ;<nd Sandals
policy of presenting worthy plays,
old or new, which are unlikely to be <
seen hereabout. "Let 'Em Eat Cake"
dosed in New York a shcit time ago
and no plans for touring the show
seem to have been formulated.
The date for the reading is Febru
ary 8. After considerable discus
sion of the matter, Sword and San
dals decided to present the reading
in the Little Theatre. The advan
tages of intimacy and acoustical i
adequacy urged against any move i
to the Assembly Hall, a> well as
the desire to co-operate *. o the full
est possible extent with ihe Drama
tic Council.
