# EX COMMITTEE TO PROBE GRID MANAGER POST
## Legality of B.A.C. Choice Of Bob Smith to Be Decided Tonight 
### 
The football managership for
1934-35 is still unawarded.
1 Tonight around the E:< Commit
: tee's shiny mahogany board will be
1 decided whether or not Bob Smith,
'35, who has been nominated by the
8.A.C., gets the job.
All football managers, including
j '33-34 Manager Bob Saxe, who sat
with Coach Thornhill on the nomi
i nating board, present sophomore
i junior assistants, will attend per
| force. Requested also are any others
| who have any interest in the ques
i tion.
Immediate Cause
i The immediate cause for tonight's
i meeting, asserted discrepancies be
| tween this year's junior manager's
i records and their actual rtiendance
at football practice, will be thor
oughly threshed out at the open in
vestigation.
It is thought likely, however, that
the system of selecting managers
| will be attacked, and that regard
less of the result of tonight's meet
i ing the Committee for Constitutional
: Revision will tuke up th_> choice of
| managers soon and will probably
I prescribe a new method lo) the fu
' ture.
Rumors in Past
Frequent in the past have been
rumors of "deals" for the manager
ships as those who have been
j around the Farm for more than two
i years remember. The present pro
! vision that any club or fraternity
may not hold any one managership
; for two successive years has seem
ingly been only a mild deterrent.
Thus for ten successive years the
track managership alternated be
j tween the world outside, and one
fraternity; and would be doing so
ito this day if one who was slated
hadn't got tired of it all.
This investigation will clear up
i the smoke, and according to ob
; servers should make Manager Smith
;or whoever gels the job wear his
j block "S" with greater satisfaction,
j The investigation takes place in the
[regular open Ex CommiVtee meet
j ing at 7:15 o'clock in the Old Union.
