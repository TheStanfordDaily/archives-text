# VARSITY SQUAD DEFEATS S.F.U. IN FAST GAME
## Initial 9 Points Is Scored By Indian Cagers; Guarding Tight 
### Frank Tremaine 
In a smashing game featured by
! tight guarding by both teams, Stan
: ford's rejuvenated basketball squad
handed San Francisco University its
second defeat of the season, 24 to 18,
last nighl in the Pavilion.
The Indians' widely heralded
j "freedom offense"' functioned to per
! fection in the first five minutes of
j the fracas and Stanford was off lo
j a 9-point lead before the Dons en-
Itered the scoring column.
Mallatratt dropped in the first bas
! ket on a set-up resulting from an
| outside play, was fouled in the
j process, and promptly added the
third point on the free throw.' An
| derson, Topping, and Anderson fol
! lowed with baskets to bring the
j total up to nine when Kincannon
'scored on a free throw for the Dons'
j first point.
By the time the half ended, San
(Francisco had only slightly closed
I the margin between the teams, the
| score being 14 to 7. While Stanford
| was scoring two points at the start
lof the second half, the Dons nar
i rowed the gap to three, but were
i never able to draw closer, and fi-
fell back again before the In
jdian onslaught.
San Francisco's only previous de
ifeat had been at the hands of the
i undefeated Olympic Club, and last
j night's Stanford victory raised In-
Idian basketball stock even higher
i than it had been after the Trojan
! defeat Saturday.
Both teams playd exceptionally
j tight defensive basketball, Stanford
I making but 16 points on field goals
while the Dons made only 10, 8 by
I Murphy and two by Chambers.

In a smashing game featured by
! tight guarding by both teams, Stan
: ford's rejuvenated basketball squad
handed San Francisco University its
second defeat of the season, 24 to 18,
last nighl in the Pavilion.
The Indians' widely heralded
j "freedom offense"' functioned to per
! fection in the first five minutes of
j the fracas and Stanford was off lo
j a 9-point lead before the Dons en-
Itered the scoring column.
Mallatratt dropped in the first bas
! ket on a set-up resulting from an
| outside play, was fouled in the
j process, and promptly added the
third point on the free throw.' An
| derson, Topping, and Anderson fol
! lowed with baskets to bring the
j total up to nine when Kincannon
'scored on a free throw for the Dons'
j first point.
By the time the half ended, San
(Francisco had only slightly closed
I the margin between the teams, the
| score being 14 to 7. While Stanford
| was scoring two points at the start
lof the second half, the Dons nar
i rowed the gap to three, but were
i never able to draw closer, and fi-
fell back again before the In
jdian onslaught.
San Francisco's only previous de
ifeat had been at the hands of the
i undefeated Olympic Club, and last
j night's Stanford victory raised In-
Idian basketball stock even higher
i than it had been after the Trojan
! defeat Saturday.
Both teams playd exceptionally
j tight defensive basketball, Stanford
I making but 16 points on field goals
while the Dons made only 10, 8 by
I Murphy and two by Chambers.
