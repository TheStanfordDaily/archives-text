Whiting Williams, industrial con
sultant, and "research tramp," who
spoke in Ihe Assembly Hall last eve
ning, makes distinctions in grada
tion between members of the lower
â€¢strata of society. According to him
! there are three classifications: (1)
I hr bo, (2) tramp, (3) bum.
The hobo is an itinerant worker
who hops freights. The tramp walks
job to job. The bum neither rides
nor walks. He stays put.
