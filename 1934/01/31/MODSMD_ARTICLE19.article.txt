# VICTIMS TO A CRAZY SYSTEM
## 
### 
The Executive Committee set out to discover any pos
sible lire behind the smoke of the Senior Football Manager
tangle and ran squarely into a wall not of stone but of
impenetrable fog. They desired to sift the charges and
arrive at an honest decision.
Hut the charges dealt with the rating system of present
Manager Saxe. To attempt to deduce anything from that
jumble "was impossible. Innocent junior managers admit
ted that they were rated for days on which they did no
work at all. Others were rated when Manager Saxe was,
in Chicago, or in the northern wilds of Washington.
Barring second sight in Saxe, the Executive Committee j
could not deduce how Saxe in Chicago could rale man-'
agers at Stanford. Further, managers were rated by Saxe
when that gentleman was not present on the field. This:
was also strange, if not downright impossible. Hut Mana
ger Saxe was pleasant about it all and rated all managers
when he was away from the scene of operations. Positive
indications of graft were therefore lacking.
Hut why not ask Manager Saxe to explain these strange
happenings? That was just the idea the Ex Committee had.
They asked him; but Mr. Saxe could tell nothing. He
was Mr. Masters' manager, not the students' manager as
many had naively supposed, and Mr. Masters had in
structed him to say nothing. He carried out his instruc
tions splendidly.
The Ex Committee was thus under the constitutional |
duty to pass on the recommendation but they were blind
folded by the action of Mr. Masters. They could rubber
stamp the recommendation and that is what, was desired.
The Ex Committee has often been the goat; but to consent;
to being made a Jjlind goat is beyond human expectation.
The Ex Committee turned the manager's selection over)
to Mr. Masters to do with it what he will. That was merely
another indication that student government is a shamâ€”!
a hollow mockery filled with applesauce, and long consti
tutions.
As to the Junior Managers, thev are all innocent vie-!
Tims of the system. They seem to have worked hard; and
all but one will be turned into the stubble field to chew on
tin cans and meditate on the cruelty of fate, fate on the I
H.A.C. pattern.
