# Floods Give Up
## 
### 
Famous Flood-Gavin estate suit
ended yesterday. Contestant Con
stance May Gavin got $1,200,000.
Her claim to mighty Flood millions:
she was illegitimate daughter of
late man-about-town Flood and
S.F. actress Eudora Willette. She
lost first round of legal bout, won
the second, now case is settled to
avoid further litigation (very ex
pensive). But compromise fails to
recognize her as Flood's daughter,
apparently feels the cool million is
Mrs. Gavin's "nuisance value."
Half the money (which is mostly
in Flood estate stock) will go to
Lawyers Taaffe and McNutt, inves
tigator Aureguy, for their trouble in
ferreting out facts in one of Cali
fornia's most famous cases. Mrs.
Gavin gets the rest. Reporters in
terviewed her in her modest L.A.
flat yesterday. Said she: "I'm so ex
cited I can't make any plans yet."
But three real estate, two automo
bile, three insurance salesmen called
on her.
