### Frank Orr 
Lashing out vigorously at the
present system of .selection of senior
football managers, the Ex Commit
tee last night refused to take action
on the recommended appointment
of Bob Smith (the present "victim"
of the system), referred final juris
diction to General Manager A1 Mas
ters of the B.A.C.
Condemning the present method
of picking managers by inefficient
ratings, the Ex Committee drafted
a new by-law giving complete
power in manager selection to Mas
ters, relinquished its present control
on ratification.
Managers Questioned
After Senior Manager Bob Saxo,
following Masters' instructions, re
fused to answer queries, questioning
of five junior managers in a closed
meeting in an attempt to unravel
rating records, resulted in the final
action, strongly expressed in the
motion finally adopted and in the
by-law which will take effect after
next week's meeting.
Ratings Criticized
''The Executive Committee se
verly condemns the present system
of selecting managers and in view
of testimony given in closed meet
ing we reject the selection made by
the graduate manager, coach, and
senior manager made under this
system窶馬ot because we personally
disapprove of any of the candidates,
but rather because the ratings of
the senior manager were so poorly
kept that the Executive Committee
does not feel that they form a com
petent basis of selection," the mo
tion read.
Changing the present by-law pro
viding for selection by the coach and
senior manager, with the graduate
manager voting in case of a tie, the
new by-law will i*ead: "All man
agers of sports under the Board o?
Athletic Control be chosen by the
graduate manager by any merit sys
tem which he sees fit; this go
into effect at the next regular meet
ing."

choice; and the other dated Janu
ary 29, asking that the E* Com
mittee not hold "any long debate
tomorrow with the various man
; agers working out of my office." The

rumors."

does not feel that they form a com
petent basis of selection," the mo
tion read.
Changing the present by-law pro
viding for selection by the coach and
senior manager, with the graduate
manager voting in case of a tie, the
new by-law will i*ead: "All man
agers of sports under the Board o?
Athletic Control be chosen by the
graduate manager by any merit sys
tem which he sees fit; this go
into effect at the next regular meet
ing."
Letters Read
Two letters from Masters to the
committee were read, one dated
January 12, branding as "unfounded"
i rumors that politics would enter into
the selection of the manager, and
naming Smith his committee's
choice; and the other dated Janu
ary 29, asking that the E* Com
mittee not hold "any long debate
tomorrow with the various man
; agers working out of my office." The
letter also condemned "unwar
ranted, unfounded accusation and
rumors."
Brought one by one before the
I committee were Manager Saxe and
Junior Managers John Brock, Gor
don Hampton, Hobart Batson. A!
Peache spoke for Junior Manager
Oliver Johnston, who had left on a
trip. Absent was Junior Manager
Burr Craycroft.
Lashing out vigorously at the
present system of .selection of senior
football managers, the Ex Commit
tee last night refused to take action
on the recommended appointment
of Bob Smith (the present "victim"
of the system), referred final juris
diction to General Manager A1 Mas
ters of the B.A.C.
Condemning the present method
of picking managers by inefficient
ratings, the Ex Committee drafted
a new by-law giving complete
power in manager selection to Mas
ters, relinquished its present control
on ratification.
Managers Questioned
After Senior Manager Bob Saxo,
following Masters' instructions, re
fused to answer queries, questioning
of five junior managers in a closed
meeting in an attempt to unravel
rating records, resulted in the final
action, strongly expressed in the
motion finally adopted and in the
by-law which will take effect after
next week's meeting.
Ratings Criticized
''The Executive Committee se
verly condemns the present system
of selecting managers and in view
of testimony given in closed meet
ing we reject the selection made by
the graduate manager, coach, and
senior manager made under this
system窶馬ot because we personally
disapprove of any of the candidates,
but rather because the ratings of
the senior manager were so poorly
kept that the Executive Committee
does not feel that they form a com
petent basis of selection," the mo
tion read.
