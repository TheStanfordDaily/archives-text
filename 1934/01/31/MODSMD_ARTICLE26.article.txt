# PRESIDENTIAL-HOPE MILLS
## 
### 
Ogdcn L. Mills has sent up his trial balloon in his' raec
lor the presidential noininafion of the Republican party,
and is now wailing for political manna to tail from the
heavens. More likely the balloon itself will tall aixl Mr.
Mills will very solemn IV deny his presidential aspirations.
The former Secretary of the Treasury is basing bis bid
for defeat in HKM on an attack on liooseveltian dictator
ship. Not yet knowing whether the economic principles
of the New Deal will function or whether they will burst
like soap bubbles, Mr. Mills hesitates to criticize on funda
mentals.
Hut dictatorship is general enough to avoid embarrass
ment and horrible enough sounding to appeal to ear
drums politically pitched. At that low pilch are the Mills
ears at present. 1
What Mr. Mills evidently does not realize is that if
Roosevelt wins, and the depression ends, the country will
not care whether Mr. Roosevelt is dictator, president, or
the (Ireat Kmperor, Son of tilt* I'niverse, and first cousin to
the Moon. If Roosevelt fails, the country will be ready for
much more than what Roosevelt can offer.
They will not be lured back to the Republican party by
phrases dealing with "great American principles" or any
thing of the sort. They will demand something more con
structive, or at least something that sounds constructive.
Mr. Mills and the Editor of the Daily may have an in
terest in constitutional problems; but neither of us are
very hungry. If the people become hungry or can't buy
new automobiles, they will want material tilings and not
constitutional guarantees.
Al least that is what usually happens. Mr. Mills is a
presidential-hope in that he hopes to be president. In all
olehr regards, he is just Mr. Ogdcn L. Mills.
