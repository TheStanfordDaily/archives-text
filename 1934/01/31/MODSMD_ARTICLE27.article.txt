lint education is wonderful. Such ambition is wonder
fill. Willi the universities spewing forth tens of thousands
of supcr-intellecis every year, we may find that America

Street corners will he cluttered with Doctors of Philoso

century pods, instead of hcing crowded with a hunch of
moronic toughs, i.e., ordinary college graduates, talking

thing that is not at least 100 years old.

interest in prizefights, dances, and money-making as their
lesser brethren.
