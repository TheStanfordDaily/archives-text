## 
### 
Aiice's Walrus finally decided that the time had come
to speak of many things, including cabbages and kings.
The Walrus (Hub has reached the same decision, though
some years later to be sure.
Tonight in the Women's Clubhouse they will conduct a
public forum on the monetary policy of President Roose
velt. Two professors will lead off the discussion, present
two sides of the question. Then, the fireworks from the
floor will be let loose.
For better or for worse, one of tlk* aces in the New Deal
is money. Though many have thought it a bit superficial
to attempt to regulate economics with money, it remains
that that root of all evils (for which all will dig, even with
Iheir teeth) remains with us. Roosevelt has made it more
intriguing than ever before.
Time was when the only problem about money was
getting it. Now, we have the additional burden of at
tempting to understand it. Tonight's discussion will he an
aid in the latter problem if not the former.
Cabbage head or king? No one will know until Roose
velt's money policy is fully realized.
