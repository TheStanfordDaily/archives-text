# REVIEWER DAMNED FOR DAMNING
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I have gotten decidedly tired of
reading the reviewer column. All it
does is tear into movies, seemingly
whether they are good or bad. It is
rapidly getting to be a joke. How
about some good constructive criti
cism that will help us show-goers
to tell if it is a good show or not.

Supposedly, the Reviewer column j
is a guide to help campus theatre 1
fiends to select a lair show. All it \
is at present is a way of ailing Miss j
Chapin's personal feeling and those ;
of her minions, which are of no in
terest to the average student. How
{•bout a little impartial judgment? !
Apparently Miss Chapin does not 1
like musical shows, but some of i
us do.
Let's get somebody that knows a
little about popular music and ma- j
jority opinion to tell us if it is a j
good show or bad show, and not a j
lot of highbrow ideas pointing out
why the show isn't, as good as Shake
speare, George Bernard Shaw or Bil- 1
lie Chapin could make it. After all, J
Hollywood has its limits, but it man- |
ages to entertain most of us.
Hoping for a change,
