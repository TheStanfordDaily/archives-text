VIENNA CIIOIK BOYS
At the War Memorial Opera House
A rare musical treat was expe
rienced by those who heard the
young Weiner Saengerknaben in
concert last Sunday afternoon. Ob
servers saw and heard a group of
18 charming and talented youths in
a variety of selections, with a minia
ture comic opera as the program's
highlight.
"The Opera Rehearsal" was a
brief but delightful affair in which
the boys appeared in costume. They
all sang extremely well, and many
of them appeared at ease in acting
r6les, but one lad was especially
capable—he who played and sang
the valet of the. hero. This boy not
only outstang his companions, but
showed a distinct flair for acting.
The first group of more classical
numbers was sung with the boys

I in ch'oirsters' garb, and the ensemble
c-ft'ect was very # striking. In this
group, the "Osacrum" and the "As
cendit" were perhaps the best exe
[ cuted, being distinguished by rare
; tonal qualities and a maturity of
interpretation.
The folk songs of the final group
were performed with the same mu
sical skill and an added quality of
! enthusiasm and spirit which made
them more charming than the
heavier numbers. Two Strauss
• waltzes, "Southern Roses" and "The
;Blue Danube" were given new life
iat the hands of this choir, and the
Brahms "Lullaby" was exquisitely
done.
The audience was especially de
lighted with the boys' singing in
, English of "Dixie," which was fol
fowed by a novel number based
solely on the letters of the alphabet.
