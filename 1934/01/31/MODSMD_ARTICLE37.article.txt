# Breakerites Hurl Pastry, Rout El Campo Minions
## 
### 
Long suffering under the superior
water fighting forces of Breakers
; Club, El Campo's minions performed
i a surprising tour de force Monday
| night, flipped the electric switch on
Breakers' back porch and under
cover of darkness inundated startled
Breakerites in a flood of water.
Loud were the imprecations,
screams, curses, rage, of scandalized
Breakers, who saw that their vaun
ted motto "Breakertainia Rules the
Waves" swept into the lee scuppers
1 in one unguarded moment.
Caught without ready access to
(heir usual implements of warfare,
the battling Breakers were at a loss
until lights were switched on and
a bevy of overstuffed cream puffs
were discerned awaiting the festive
boards. Rapidly the Breakers mo
; bile forces went into action, stripped
1 for the fray.
