# Hitler Hand-Out
## 
### 
Handsome (?) Adoif struck out
with both fists on Nazidom's first
anniversary, bashed monarchist
hopes squarely in the solar plexus.
No. 1 Henchman Goering, Prussia's
Premier and Government, ordered
all monarchist organizations dis
solved, said restoration of former
rulers was out of the question. In
addition, Hitler attacked as usual
the Versailles Treaty, Woodrow
Wilson, allies generally. Other Hit
lerisms: "A proud nation cannot re
nounce equality. Nobody is strong
enough to prevent our attaining it."
"Friendship between Russia and
Germany must be maintained at all
costs."
This last gesture toward Russia
was conciliatory reply to No. 1 Dic
tator Stalin's* recent remark that
hostile nations should not stick
"their swinish snouts into our Com
munist garden."
