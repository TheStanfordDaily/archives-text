# NOW PART OF EVENING'S ENTERTAINMENT
## 
### 
The truth of the matter, however,
sarcasm aside, is that booing has
come to be accepted as part of the
evening's entertainment at a Stan
ford basketball game. We do it for
the fun of the tiling and mean no
h;.i m by it. The sad part of the sit
uation, though, is thai no one out
side our immediate family circle
looks on booing with the same tol
erant attitude. And as a result we
have acquired the reputation of hav
ing among the most unsportsman
like crowds on the Coast.
Why not stick the officials in a
cage and trundle them out between
halves, do all our booing at once,
and spend the rest of the evening
really following the game, one of the
most interesting in the world to
watch? â€”Chuck Chappell
