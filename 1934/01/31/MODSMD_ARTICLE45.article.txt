# INDIAN FRESHMEN WHIP S.F.U. BABES BY 30-22 SCORE
## 
### 
| Assuming a 9-point lead before
! the game was well under way,
I Stanford's freshman basketball team
last night defeated the heretofore
unbeaten San Francisco University
yearling quintet by a 30-22 score.
The game was played as a prelimi
| nary to the varsity encounter be
tween the two schools in the En-
I cina gymnasium.
j After gathering their 10-1 advan
tage, the Card frosh held the upper
| hand without once losing the lead.
| Stanford's attack was inconsistent at
| times, but the Indians followed
i every S.F.U. rally with one at least
1 as profitable.
Turner Stars
Amassing nine points, Howell
! Turner, Cardinal forward, led the
i scorers. He was followed by Indian
! center Dale Beedle, and Lewis, San
Francisco forward, who tallied seven
| points apiece. Dinty Moore and Carl
Schott, guards, each added six digits
to the Stanford total.
Both teams looked ragged in the
early stages of the game. After
scoring three quick points when the
game began, Stanford slowed down,
passed poorly, held the ball too
long, and generally showed a poor
offensive. However, the Card Babes
came through with an exceptional
defense and did not permit Don set
up shots.
The highly rated San Franciscans
also failed offensively during the
first of the game. Their shots, for
the most part from far out in the
court, were erratic; and they missed
the few set-up shots that were al
lowed. The Dons began to find their
range toward the end of the first
perid, and they closed the gap in
score to 8-13, the closest the losing
five came to leading the Cards.
The half-time score favored the
Indians, 19 to 9.
Stanford came back strong in the
second half and boomed the lead
several points before settling down
to a defensive game. The Dons found
openings galore for easy shots dur
ing the last period, but their scor
ing attempts were still erratic.
Strong Defense
Moore, Schott, and Beedle played
outstanding defensive games for
Stanford. Schott was expelled early
in the second half for personal fouls.
