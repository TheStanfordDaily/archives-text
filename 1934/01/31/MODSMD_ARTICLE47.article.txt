# VARSITY AND FROSH WATER POLO TEAMS SPLASH WITH LAKESIDE CLUB SATURDAY
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity and freshman
water polo players will meet the
Lakeside Club teams in the Encina
pools here Saturday afternoon.
Both Stanford teams claim un
spotted records for the five league
games to date, and the Cardinals
are heavily favored to pass the small
Lakeside hurdle. Neither club team
has won a conference contest as yet.
Coach Nort Thornton plans to use
the Lakeside tilt as a practice ses
sion in preparation for the strong
Olympic Club teams, who will play
Stanford next week.
Saturday's preliminary frosh-
Lakeside reserves game will start at
3:30 o'clock, with the varsity en
counter to get under way shortly
after 4 o'clock. The public is in
vited; no admission charge will be
made.
