# GRAYSON TO PLAY ON VARSITY NINE VERSUS SAN JOSE
## 
### 
Coach Bill Hubbard's San Jose
Staters invade the Farm today for
another tussle with the Cardinal
varsity baseball team in an endeavor
to regain face after last week's 12-3
whipping handed by Coach Wolter's
men.
The game, which will be called at
3:15 o'clock on the Sunken diamond,
is the last informal practice game
before the regular season gets under
way Saturday.
A feature will be the premier ap
pearance of Bobby Grayson, who
worked. out for the first time this
week. He seems to have recovered
fully from his gridiron injuries and
has shown all the skill and dash
which characterized his play last
year on the frosh nine.
A starting line-up was not an
nounced yesterday, but the same
men that played last week prob
ably see service today. Wolter will
undoubtedly save his best twirlers
for Saturday's game against the
Athens Club, and will use legs ex
perienced mounds me n today.
Blanchard, Armstrong, and Ivory
will probably see action at this post.
Stan Anderson, ace Card pitcher,
twisted his ankle slightly in prac
tice Monday night, but will be ready
for the opener Saturday. At short
stop Wolter will get a look at Gal
braith, who returns to the squad
after an enforced lay-off due to an
injured ankle.
