# MALONEY DIRECTS RUGBY CAMPAIGN TOWARD OLYMPICS
## 
### 
A campaign to restore rugby to
international Olympic- games com
petition has been started here by
Harry Maloney, president of the
Northern California Rugby Union.
At a recent meeting of the directors
of the Union, a resolution was ap
proved asking the American Olym
pic Games Committee to take the
matter up with the international
committee when the two boards
meet in either New York or Wash
ington, D.C., next month.
The game has not been official in
the Olympics since 1924, when a
team from California universities
and clubs went to Pfiris and won the
Olympic title.
Germany Co-operates
That year the California team
was financed by donations from
sports minded citizens of this re
gion. Maloney has high hopes of re
instating in the Berlin games of 193<>
and at the Tenth Olympiad in Los
Angeles he conferred with German
j athletic officials and received their
promises of co-operation.
At the same meeting of the Rugby
Union, held at the Olympic Club in
San Francisco, Monday night, a rul
ing was approved limiting the num
ber of substitutes in future games
to eight men. Formerly a three-man
i rule was in efTectj but it fell into
! gradual disrepute this reason, and
all manner of substitutions have
, been made.
Fresno Game Slated
Another game was scheduled for
the Stanford 15 against Fresno State
who are just starting the game and
would like a practice tilt with some
' experienced squad. They will tangle
with the Stanford seconds here Feb
ruary 17, when the varsity meets
i Lane Hospital.
Last night found, Frank Alustiza
definitely out for the squad trying
' a few long boots from the fullback
j position. Jack Hillman, who turned
' out and played two brilliant games
earlier in the season, is also back in
uniform to aid in boosting the drive
of the Indian scrum.
Duquesne was the leading Catho
' lie football team in 1933.
