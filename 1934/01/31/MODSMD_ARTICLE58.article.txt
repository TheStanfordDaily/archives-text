# BASKETBALL RALLY TURNS INTO ORGAN RECITAL AT U.S.C.
## 
### 
Tale of a super-stupendous Tro
jan basketball rally before the Stan
ford game last week that turned
into an organ recital after reporters
had put in an evening of phone calls
trying to find someone that had
heard of the game, not to mention
a rally, was disclosed in the Daily
Trojan.
The day before the game, the day
editor assigned a generous portion
of the front page to the rally which
would precede the Friday contest.
Reporters assigned to the story
sought in vain in .the Student Union,
breaking up pinochle games and
disturbing naps, but. no one knew
about the rally, nor had anyone
seen the rally committee chairman
or the student body president for
two days.
When even the reporters failed to
come back, the irate editor tried
calling up authorities on the pay
phone, but, 17 nickels later, gave up
in disgust. Then the organist called
in to discover where the rally was
to be and when told it "was nix,"
offered to put on a recital instead.
And that's why editors go wild, re
porters tear their hair, and the rally
lurned out to be an organ recital.
