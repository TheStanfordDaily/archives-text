# Students Pay More for Incidentals Than Books
## 
### CHARLOTTE BURRIDGE 
Are you an average student? If
you are, then you spend thi'ee times
as much for cigarettes, candy, mo
vies, and dates as you do for text
books. It takes candy, gum, pea
nuts, and soft urinks together to tie
with cigarette costs.
According to figures compiled by
the National Association of Teach
ers of Marketing, the average United
States college student spends from
$25 to $37 for cigarettes during a
school year. This, of course, varies
with the number of mid-quarter
and final exams dished out.
Girl friends are not so expensive

as the typical rough, griping about
the high cost of dating, seems to
think. All types of entertainment,
including athletic tickets, and dates
in general, average a cost of only
$35 to $60, the report shows.
Fraternities, with their implied
expenditures for rings, pins, and
dues total twice the sum used for
the purchase of books. Assuming, of
course, that the man is lucky
enough to get his pin back from the
ex-girl friend.
A careful personal budget ac
counting student will find that his
financial standing suffers a loss of
from $12 to $15 from use of books
purchased new and sold at the end
of the quarter. If bought new and
not resold the average price of
books for the year is $25. That is,
providing the professor has not writ
ten a new book during the year.
