# Washington Student Flays Tyrannical Faculty Rules

### 
"Free speech on the campus is a
farce," declared the irate chairman
of University of Washington's Na
tional Students League, when cam
pus authorities this week refused to
permit a meeting of anti-war and
anti-compul&ory ROTC adyocates on
the U. of W. campus.
Permission to hold the symposium
on pacifism in the regular meeting
place, Vernon Hall was firmly re

fused the league by Dean David-
Thompson on the grounds that the
subject would be "over-emotion
alized."
"We will hold the symposium no
matter what the Dean says," Miss
Horowitz retorted. "If it has to be
held off-campus, we will arrange a
meeting place."

Jack Chevigny, another of Knute
Rockne's boys, has been appointed
head coach at the University of
Texas.
