Harvard Ph. D
Dr. Haley was born in St. John,
New Brunswick in Canada and there
went through the lower grades and
high school. He came to Stanford
as a student following the War and
was grunted an A.B. degree in 1922

ley then taught at Stanford for a
year as instructor. He earned his

Since that time he has been in
the Economics Department at Stan
ford, being made executive head in
the autumn of 1931. He was granted
a Ph.D. degree at Harvard in 1931.
Not Business Training
Dr. Haley stresses the fact that
economics does not serve so much
as direct preparation for a pi-ofes
sion as for training in good citizen
ship.
Maintaining that economics is not
an attempt to train for business, he
said, "It is one of several subjects
which is a useful background to
have for a large number of profes
sions. We try to convince our ma
jors of the desirability of getting a
broad background."
Economics Has Wide Field
Closely akin to the other social
sciences, political science, philoso
phy, history, psychology; the eco
nomics major includes within its
department proper sociology, ac
countancy, and statistics.
There are at the present time 16
professors, assistants, and instruc
tors on the faculty of the depart
ment, and the majors number 210.
Flexibility Necessary
National and world problems for
which economics furnishes a good
background for an understanding
are war debt, unemployment, N.R.A.,
stability of the dollar, depression,
and innumerable other current news
topics.
Flexibility is one of the prime
ideals of the economics major, only
45 units being required in eco
nomics.

said, "It is one of several subjects
which is a useful background to
have for a large number of profes
sions. We try to convince our ma
jors of the desirability of getting a
broad background."
Economics Has Wide Field
Closely akin to the other social
sciences, political science, philoso
phy, history, psychology; the eco
nomics major includes within its
department proper sociology, ac
countancy, and statistics.
There are at the present time 16
professors, assistants, and instruc
tors on the faculty of the depart
ment, and the majors number 210.
Flexibility Necessary
National and world problems for
which economics furnishes a good
background for an understanding
are war debt, unemployment, N.R.A.,
stability of the dollar, depression,
and innumerable other current news
topics.
Flexibility is one of the prime
ideals of the economics major, only
45 units being required in eco
nomics.
Professor Bernard Francis Haley,
executive head of the Department
of Economics will address lower div
ision students and others interested
on the "Choice of Economics as a
Department Major" at 7 o'clock to
night in the Little Theatre.
This is the second lecture of the
series scheduled to help lower div
ision students in their selection of
a major school or department.
Harvard Ph. D
Dr. Haley was born in St. John,
New Brunswick in Canada and there
went through the lower grades and
high school. He came to Stanford
as a student following the War and
was grunted an A.B. degree in 1922
and an A.M. in 1923.
A scholar in economics at Har
vard University in 1923-24, Dr. Ha
ley then taught at Stanford for a
year as instructor. He earned his
A.M. degree at Harvard in 1926.
Since that time he has been in
the Economics Department at Stan
ford, being made executive head in
the autumn of 1931. He was granted
a Ph.D. degree at Harvard in 1931.
Not Business Training
Dr. Haley stresses the fact that
economics does not serve so much
as direct preparation for a pi-ofes
sion as for training in good citizen
ship.
Maintaining that economics is not
an attempt to train for business, he
said, "It is one of several subjects
which is a useful background to
have for a large number of profes
sions. We try to convince our ma
jors of the desirability of getting a
broad background."
