# DR. E. VINCENT RELATES WORK OF FOUNDATION
## Lecturer Tells of Dangers Encountered in Battle Against Fevers 
### 
Graphically presenting the history
of the fight against yellow fever,
Dr. George E. Vincent yesterday
morning appeared before an all -
University assembly.
Unusual fluency and excellence of
presentation made his subject,' in
teresting in itself, seem truly a "Sci
entific Adventure." He vividly de
scribed conditions in South Amer
ica, stressing the deplorable condi
tions in Panama shortly after the
building of the Panama Canal, and
sketching the personalities and ac
complishments of men who combat
ted the dreaded plague.
Vincent was formerly president of
the Rockefeller Foundation in New
York, a position making him a
qualified authority on the subject.
Under his direction, camapigns for
extermination of the disease
spreading mosquito were waged
throughout the world, and valuable
experiments conducted.
An ever-ready sense of humor
was given full rein throughout the
talk, which was enthusiastically re
ceived by the unusually crowded
assembly hall audience.
Vincent, in outlining the steps
taken in wiping out the disease,
made use of statistics and records
to form a clear picture of the extent
of suffering; and ended with a dra
matic portrayal of outstanding he
roes in the fight, many of whom
died in an effort to benefit human
ity.
All 11 o'clocks were dismissed in
order to enable students to attend
the lecture. The greater part of the
audience, however, consisted of Palo
Altans.
