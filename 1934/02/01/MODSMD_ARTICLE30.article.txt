# HALEY ADVISES ECONOMICS AS AID TO CITIZEN
## Department Head Outlines Purpose of Major To L.D. Group MINOR AIM PRACTICAL First of Series of Talks Backed by Guidance Heads Delivered 
### 
The person who wants merely to
earn more money than the other
person cannot get much from the
Economics Department, said Dr.
Bernard F. Haley, executive head
of the department, last night in the
Little Theatre, in discussing eco
nomics as a major which Lower
Division students might choose.
He humorously added that such
a person might better learn to get
more money from the example of
our present-day congressmen.
Chance for leader
"In the department of economics,"
Dr. Haley explained, "we are inter
ested in providing the opportunity
for the man who is likely to be one
of the leaders of the community."
The purpose of economics, he
stressed, is not primarily to provide
a business training, although it is
true that the department does pro
vide work which will assist the bus
iness man. Courses in accountancy
and banking first of all give a gen
eral knowledge and only seconda
rily furnish direct vocational train
ing for the prospective worker.
Impartial Discussion
Dr. Haley explained in a straight
forward, impartial manner that the
training, study, and discussion of
subjects included in the Economics
Department will be of aid to all in
dividuals who look into the world
about them, trying to find out what
it is all about.
During the period of open forum
discussion following the lecture
proper, a lively questioning and de
bating of requirements of the de
partment and necessary subjects for
various vocations took place. An
economics major is good prepara
tion for the prospective lawyer and
medical student as well as for pro
fessional economists and economic
statisticians, Dr. Haley maintained.
Much of the discussion related to
the connection between a major in
economics and the Graduate School
of Business. Economics is as good a
foundation for this school as any
other major, said Haley, but he fur
ther stressed that it is not the only
good major for it.
Dr. C. Gilbert Wrenn acted as
chairman of the meeting. Other
talks of a vocational nature are
planned for the future by Dr.
Wrenn's guidance committee.
