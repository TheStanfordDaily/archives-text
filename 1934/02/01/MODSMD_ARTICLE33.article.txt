# THE SHAM OF STUDENT GOVERNMENT
## 
### 
Many I hero are who are criticizing Ihe Executive Com
mittee for capitulating to the "recommendations" of the
(iradiiate Manager in re the selection of a Senior Football
Manager.
t hose students are correct in holding that the Execu
tive Committee bowed; but what they do not realize is
that the bowing was inevitable. Xo other course was open.
II it was a question of bowing or breaking, there might be
;i theoretical argument in favor of breaking first. That
argument in favor of strong determinism is excellent in
battle. Hut here, there was no battle to light. There was
no glory to win. â€¢>
The Ex Committee could refuse to do anything and
find themselves silting tight, sitting light that is on nothing.
Or they could do what thev did do and show thai this loose
talk about self-government is loose talk.
There is a good argument that student government
should be abolished entirely, letting the faculty run every
thing just as they want il. The advantages of experience
mi government are limited to a few, and those would have
to pick il up during vacations. There is also a good argu
ment in favor of genuine student government. Hut there
is practically only argument when student self-government
is merely a figure of speech.
Student government has the power to grant Roble a 7
to <X; and that power no one has questioned, as yet. The
students can tine themselves for speeding. That is a real
privilege and governmental power. And the Ex Committee
had the power of approving of manager recommendations.
Hut that power exists no longer unless the students wish
to approve without being allowed to know what they are
approving. And approving anything in ignorance is akin
to playing blind man's bluff with squirrels in a walnut
orchard.
There are some who claim that the full choice of man
agers should be with the B.A.C. in that they handle their
property. That may be so. Hut if that is so, why give the
students power to check B.A.C. recommendations? And if
that [lower is given, and the students plan to do the job in
the thorough scientific manner taught in political science
courses, why are they frustrated l>\ the powcrs-that-be in
the 8.A.C.?
Student government is artificial at best because it is
something that the I'niversity can end at will. But when
Ihe I'niversity Administration plays the game according
to Ihe students' constitution, the B.A.C. is most presumptu
ous to act in a eontrarv manner.-
