# To Dr. Vincent, Four Stars
## 
### 
There is such u tiling as being intelligent. There is such
a thing as being entertaining. The combination is very
tare. That combination was realized in the person of Dr.
(icorge K. Vincent, speaker at the I Diversity assembly yes
terday.
Many speakers turn into miserable flops; and students
wedged in the middle seats cannot escape. That is perhaps
why the Assembly Hall was not packed. We remember
still the agony of the von Kuhlmann dissertation.
Hut yesterday was delightful charm and intelligence,
( harming intelligence, and intelligent charm. To Dr. Vin
cent, four stars.
