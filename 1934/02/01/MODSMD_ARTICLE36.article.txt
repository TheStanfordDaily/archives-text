# CAMPUS OPINION
## TRACK SQUAD GO FAST 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Stanford lias the best little big
team this year that il has ever had,
and yet the Board of Athletic Con
trol has decided not to send a track
team East for the 1.C.4-A.
In view of the fact that there are
so many reasons why Stanford
should be represented this year in
that meet it seems quite unjustified
that the B.A.C. has voted against it.
For the past several years, it is
true, we have hoped to come back
with a winning group, and a few
years we have succeeded. But never
before have we had such a few num
ber of men that are so concentrated
into such great power. An eight
man team could be picked Ihat
would have a fine chance of coming
through with a national champion
ship. Our three weight men are al
most certain of garnering 20 points
between them—Johnny Lyman and
Gordon Dunn in the shot and dis
cus, and Johnny Mottram in the
javelin. Two track men could be
selected that would come through.
A1 Blaekman, Chuck Nimmo, and
Carlton Thorns are fast rounding
into shape, and two of these men
will undoubtedly be clipping off real
times by the latter part of May.
when the 1.C.4-A. is scheduled. Then
too, we have a fine broad-jumper
(in fact two of them), a real pole
vaulter, besides Captain Gus Meier
in the hurdles. Last year Gus proved
that he was the man to beat this
year in the hurdles. That is an
eighi-man team that will be tough
to beat. Of course it would be pos
sible to name several other likely
candidates, such as a high-jumper
and another track man.
The decision of tne Board was, 1
believe, to cut down expenses this
year. That is a valid reason, but an
eight or ten-man team could be
sent East this year more economi
cally than ever before. In previous
years we have not had the concen
trated strength that we possess this
year, and it has been necessary to
send a large team back to the meet.
When the decision was made to
eliminate the 1.C.4-A. as far as
Stanford was concerned, it was
hoped that U.S.C. would do l he
same. However, it is hard to believe
that U.S.C. would make such a silly
decision. They are the defending
champions, and with the prestige
and honor of winning that meet,
I they will be almost crtain to go;
and, I feel, our squad will be fully
equal to their team.
The N.C.AA. meet is to be held
in Los Angeles the 23d and 24th of
June. That is almost a month fol
lowing the 1.C.4-A. Also, and far
more important, is the fact that that
meet will be a post-season contest.
Practically every school in the coun
try will be out by then, so that the
winner of the 1.C.4-A. will be con
sidered by the student bodies of the
schools throughout the country as

J the national champions. The 1.C.4-A.
! meet is the big meet of the year, and
with oil the possibilities that Stan
| ford has of winning the meet, it
seems we should be represented.
Stanford's superiority was shat-
I tered by Columbia. Is now the time
that we should sit back and con
sider ourselves a little too good to
get back that superiority and k<?ep
it where it belongs—right here at
Stanford?
If the B.A.C. does not feel that it
I can send a track team to that meet,
I the administration and the student
body could get behind a movement
to raise the necessary funds. That
would be accomplished ouite read
! ily, even if it would be bordering
1 on the begging side of money rais
ing. If the B.A.C. desires to raise
the funds, I believe they could do it.
Let's send a team to that meet.

The Editor, Sir:
Stanford lias the best little big
team this year that il has ever had,
and yet the Board of Athletic Con
trol has decided not to send a track
team East for the 1.C.4-A.
In view of the fact that there are
so many reasons why Stanford
should be represented this year in
that meet it seems quite unjustified
that the B.A.C. has voted against it.
For the past several years, it is
true, we have hoped to come back
with a winning group, and a few
years we have succeeded. But never
before have we had such a few num
ber of men that are so concentrated
into such great power. An eight
man team could be picked Ihat
would have a fine chance of coming
through with a national champion
ship. Our three weight men are al
most certain of garnering 20 points
between them—Johnny Lyman and
Gordon Dunn in the shot and dis
cus, and Johnny Mottram in the
javelin. Two track men could be
selected that would come through.
A1 Blaekman, Chuck Nimmo, and
Carlton Thorns are fast rounding
into shape, and two of these men
will undoubtedly be clipping off real
times by the latter part of May.
when the 1.C.4-A. is scheduled. Then
too, we have a fine broad-jumper
(in fact two of them), a real pole
vaulter, besides Captain Gus Meier
in the hurdles. Last year Gus proved
that he was the man to beat this
year in the hurdles. That is an
eighi-man team that will be tough
to beat. Of course it would be pos
sible to name several other likely
candidates, such as a high-jumper
and another track man.
The decision of tne Board was, 1
believe, to cut down expenses this
year. That is a valid reason, but an
eight or ten-man team could be
sent East this year more economi
cally than ever before. In previous
years we have not had the concen
trated strength that we possess this
year, and it has been necessary to
send a large team back to the meet.
When the decision was made to
eliminate the 1.C.4-A. as far as
Stanford was concerned, it was
hoped that U.S.C. would do l he
same. However, it is hard to believe
that U.S.C. would make such a silly
decision. They are the defending
champions, and with the prestige
and honor of winning that meet,
I they will be almost crtain to go;
and, I feel, our squad will be fully
equal to their team.
The N.C.AA. meet is to be held
in Los Angeles the 23d and 24th of
June. That is almost a month fol
lowing the 1.C.4-A. Also, and far
more important, is the fact that that
meet will be a post-season contest.
Practically every school in the coun
try will be out by then, so that the
winner of the 1.C.4-A. will be con
sidered by the student bodies of the
schools throughout the country as

J the national champions. The 1.C.4-A.
