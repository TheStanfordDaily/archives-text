# ARE YOU (GAME) COLOR CONSCIOUS?

! The Editor, Sir:
What? Only one campus opinion
on "card stunts or no card stunts?"
i There seems to be no pep on the
: Farm.
Finally decided to pull myself and
imy bad grammar and worse style
together and express my feelings:
Card stunts are a lot of
j are part of the colorful picture of a
' Big Game. They are well planned
and usually quite well done —and
we really ought to be "capable" of
holding up the right card, and not
I the black one instead of the green
i one.
Wouldn't, we look and feel cute
without card stunts when Cal or
U.S.C. had them in their rooting
! section? Of course we would" say:
"Card stunts are crummy, we are
lever so glad they were abolished."
But inwardly we would be thinking
| about the good old card stunts days
and sorry they were gone.
Why not leave the white skirt and
i sweater idea and the rooters' hats
out, too? Why not give up the pom-
I pom waving? , Why not the
j football players play in dingy grey
suits? Why have a band play to pep
us, and perhaps the team, up? Why
, have a "six" for the team, the coach
or the hero of a touchdown? And
why have a big spelling?
All these things add to the thrill,
I the excitement characteristic of a
Big Game, all this makes it a spe
i cial event .... and so do the card
stunts.
i If we begin to analyze, every-
I thing seems pointless—but. let's not
I analyze and HAVE CARD STUNTS.
Sincerely,
A "pro card stunter"
