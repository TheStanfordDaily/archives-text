PASTICHE AND PREJUDICE
Of Musical lilms
Through the years there has been
one popular condemnation of Holly
wood so insistent and, at the same
I time, so obviously true that it
scarcely needs proof. It pertains to
the belief—by no means unknown
to the stage, either—that if one
thing is good, six things of the same
sort are six times as good.
One illustration of this theory in
dull practice was the series' of war
pictures followed upon the heels of
"The Big Parade." The same might
be' observed of the film gangster.
But the most pertinent; illustration
which remains is the musical film.
We are now well into the second
series of film musicals—a series
which began with "42nd Street" (as
the first began with "The Broadway
Melody") and will continue, as the
first did, until the general ennui
arising from repetition becomes evi
dent at the box office.
The musical films as they arrive
are seen to have different settings,
varied casts, and occasionally a song
somewhat brighter than the music
on the whole. But at the same time,
in going to a musical, one can be
certain of finding, as well: a foolish,
sentimental—and often vulgar—plot
which is not relegated to the prop
erly obscure place of plot in mu
sicals. And while the dance rou
tines are, in detail, varied, they do
not (save occasionally and thanks,

usually, to some outlandish spring I
of directorial inspiration) present a j
varied impression on the whole.!
This is not aided by the fact that j
while every conceivable qamera I
angle has been employed to make'
this minuteness of variation evident,
these same camera angles have
themselves fallen into a pattern.
Why, then, bother to comment
critically upon such films at all? It
should bo sufficiently for kindness
to note that they exist. However,
in need of copy and with the howls
of press-agenlry demanding space
tchoing in his ears, the critic is |
forced to write something.
What, (hen, is there to do? The
reviewer may note that the film is
a current attraction, name cast and
director, list any songs worth men
tion, and let it go at that. He may,
on the other hand, employ humor
to dismiss the phantom as satirically
as it deserves.
That old saw of cranks, "con
structive criticism," as meaningless
a phrase as it is, may then be lev
elled at the critic's head. This does
not destroy the chief point: the film
is the same.
Musicals so constructed cease to i
be of interest If) the critic directly J
they fall into the rut of continued !
repetition. Musicals in such a state
are for the attention only of the
public as long as the public goes to
the theatre in profitable quantity.
The film musical needs what "Of j

Thee I Sing" (and earlier, the Gil- j
bert and Sullivan comic operas) J
gave to tlie hackneyed stage musi- j
cal: «a genuinely new and substan- I
tial basis.. Instead, film musicals too
often nftw become innocent bur- '
lesqucs of themselves, thanks to the
strenuous efforts of producers to j
make each outdo the last in dis
play, if not in character. —Sandob
