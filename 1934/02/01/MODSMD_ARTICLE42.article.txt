Stanford is singular. The long,
palm-shaded drive running up to the
Chapel's vari-colored mosaic, I he
covered walk.s around the Quad, the
hills behind the campus that roll
into the Bay are all distinctive. The
very sandstone walls, that keep cold
as well as light from the class
! rooms, are different.
This singularity also pervades hu
! man beings. Stanford is probably
the only college in the world where
1 a man could wear sport shoes and a
j sheepskin at the same time.
Most remarkable, the inner fibres,
'the souls if you prefer, of Stanford
I men and women are dissimilar to
| other inferior inner fibres or souls.
A very good evidence of which sin
gularity is Stanford's impertinent
j thoughtlessness.
"Sideline Slants" capably dis-
I cussed that thoughtlessness yester
day in relation to basketball booing.
There is an excuse io>- basketball
, booing: to insult a basketball off!-
i cial (who never attended your par
ticular alma mater) is the righteous
[prerogative of all red-blooded col
j legians.
But to insult a member of one's
| own University faculty by walking
| out on him while he is lecturing is
! a particular impertinence whose
i punishment should be a late worse
than death.
At 11 o'clock each weekday morn
ing, enlightened pedagogues who en
i joy the enviable vocation of teach
ing history and economics and ethics

I to Ballyhoo-reading students begin
to disseminate their information.
And from 11:45 to 12:05 o'clock, the
pedagogue's voice must compete for
the auditory right of way with slam
ming doors and shuffling feet that
are slammed and shuffled by stu
dents who walk out during the lec
ture.
For the hasher who leaves early,
there is sometimes a valid alibi: to
live he must eat; to cat he must
; work: to work he occasionally must
appear at his place of employment
I at 12 sharp. But for the man or
woman who, merely because the
: back of his lap is fatigued from con
tact with the softest of pine wood,
sits with bated breath and glistening
eye waiting for the noon whistl" in
oder that he may reach the door
before the whistle and the profes
sor have .stopped blowing, is rank
poor taste.
This' is not a defense of professors
who lecture beyond the hour's end.
Continual behavior of this sort i.s
detrimental to the spirit of higher,
, mimeographed education. But it is
| not entirely unreasonable to assume
that a professor i.s desirous of help
ing his students. Ol'ten such help
cannot be parcelled out into exact,
50-minute periods. When a teacher
i.s summarizing a lecture and runs
over the 11 o'clock hour, he is not
malignantly attempting to prevent
the satiation of his students' nutri
tive appetites. Rather he is trying
to satiate intellectual appetites that
( respond by disappearing and allow-

! ing their owners to walk out while
the lecturer is still talking.
| Individualism, even though not
! rugged, is a noble quality. Boorish
: ness is not. To interrupt a professor
who happens to consume an extra
minute of your invaluable time is a
form of singularity that i.s ingra
ciously boorish, out cleverly indi
vidualistic. â€”Dick Strouse
