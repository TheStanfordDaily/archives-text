final matches, the preliminaries hav
ing been held earlier in the week.
All of the bouts promise to provide
plenty of fast action and thrills with
many well-known contenders com

struggle in the 155-pouncl division
of the wrestling. Last year Cooke
managed to take the decision but
both are stronger and faster now.
Bob Moore is the only contestant
with a chance of becoming a double
winner. He is showing his versa
tility by meeting Sam Glenn in the
l(!5-pound division of the wrestling
and by trading punches with Bill
Sim 'of football fame in the same
weight of the boxing. The latter
bout should prove one of the high
lights of the evening's entertain
ment, because, although Sim is new
to Stanford boxing circles, he is fast
and wiry and ought to give Moore
plenty of opposition.
The other boxing bouts which
should prove more than interesting
are the meeting of John Huston and
Cabby Caballero in the 128-pound

ler, varsity football center, and Ma
rion "Brick" Mitchell in the unlim
ited division.

Gold awards will be given to the winners by the Circle "S" Society,
which is sponsoring the affair. Admission will be free to students upon

presentation of student body cards,'
while a 55-cent charge will be made
for off-campus spectators.
The wrestling will be run off first
with the boxing to immediately fol
low at approximately 8:30 o'clock.
IJutts to Referee
Jake Butts, Stanford's popular
student wrestling coach, will referee
tonight's mat encounters, while Fred
Frehe, Dick Kelly, and Myron
Sprague act as timers. Decisions in
ihe wrestling will consist of one fall
or if no fall results at the end of
seven minutes, the timers will an
nounce a top time decision. Should
this result in a draw, the bout will
continue extra minutes.
Coach Myron Schall will referee
the boxing and the judges will be
Joe Niederost, Dave Stevenson, and
Charles Bxansten. Three rounds will
be the limit of the bouts, with the
judges' decisions being final.
Finals Only
Tonight's card consists of only
final matches, the preliminaries hav
ing been held earlier in the week.
All of the bouts promise to provide
plenty of fast action and thrills with
many well-known contenders com
peting.
Dave Cooke and Bud Sophian
should put up a very interesting
struggle in the 155-pouncl division
of the wrestling. Last year Cooke
managed to take the decision but
both are stronger and faster now.
Bob Moore is the only contestant
with a chance of becoming a double
winner. He is showing his versa
tility by meeting Sam Glenn in the
l(!5-pound division of the wrestling
and by trading punches with Bill
Sim 'of football fame in the same
weight of the boxing. The latter
bout should prove one of the high
lights of the evening's entertain
ment, because, although Sim is new
to Stanford boxing circles, he is fast
and wiry and ought to give Moore
plenty of opposition.
The other boxing bouts which
should prove more than interesting
are the meeting of John Huston and
Cabby Caballero in the 128-pound
class, and that between Wes Mul
ler, varsity football center, and Ma
rion "Brick" Mitchell in the unlim
ited division.
