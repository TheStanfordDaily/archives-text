# Nimmo and March Show Good Form in Distances
## 
### 
While Chuck Nimmo was running
a nice 880 in 1:59.3 seconds, Fresh
man Rusty March ran his first two
mile, and a good two-mile it was,
too, with Dink Templeton snapping
his watch at the finish in 10:15. That
is pretty fair time for varsity men
on the Coast, considering that it is
Rusty's first eight-lap race, he
.should be able to clip considerably
under that, as he showed a terrific
hurst of speed for th'j last 75 yards.
