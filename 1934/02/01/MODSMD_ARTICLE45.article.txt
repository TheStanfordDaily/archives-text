# Mentor Drives Squad in Long Hoop Practice
## Emil Cowing Is Star Of Severe Scrimmage 
### 
Pointing for the second game of j
the California series, to be played at 1
1 Berkeley Saturday night, Coach j
| John Bunn sent the reserve section i
' of his rejuvenated basketball team
through a strenuous scrimmage last
! night, while giving the regular '
! quintet a layoff from active work.
With Emil Cowing, scrappy ball- j
hawk, ringing the hoop from all I
angles, the second team finished up j
] their practice game in a virtually I
j dead heat with the third stringers, I
j indicating that Bunn is rapidly de- J
I veloping a capable crew of reserves j
] to back up his starting five.
Free Throws
Topping, Anderson, Edelen, Rog- j
ers, and Mallatratt, the first-string j
! quintet that vanquished the mighty I
! Trojans and Dons, spent their lime I
! shooting free throws. Whether de-'
liberate, unintentional, or otherwise, j
a good many personal fouls are usu- i
ally committed in a Bear-Indian se- I
l ies, making the success or non- j
! success of free throws an important
; factor in the final outcome.
Although Arnie Anderson seems
tc have a grip on the right' forward
post by virtue of his flashy playing
I against S.C. and the University of
San Francisco, Cowings deadeye
I ability will probably earn him a :
: good deal of action in coming games. \
Chances Strong
! Distinctly the underdog in their !
last game with California, the In- j
| dians surprised by holding the Bears !
I fairly even except for the usual
! high-scoring efforts of Hal Eifert. 1
Saturday, however, Stanford chances :
will probably be rated several |
notches higher as a result of the ,
Indians' showing in the last two j
| games. Likewise, California's com
paratively unimpressive showing j
; against U.C.L.A. will do them little
good in the eyes of pre-game dope- j
j .sters.
The principal item that makes a j
California-Stanford cage game un- |
predictable is Captain Hal Eifert. i
the Bears veteran forward, who
j usually runs wild in the matter of;
ringing up scores. If Eifert can be
stopped, Stanford chances will be
considerably improved. S.C.'s Gut
tero was held to a slim total of
seven points in the second game
last week, so the Indians may be j
able to repeat against the Blue and I
Gold's chief threat.

will probably be rated several |
notches higher as a result of the ,
Indians' showing in the last two j
| games. Likewise, California's com
paratively unimpressive showing j
; against U.C.L.A. will do them little
good in the eyes of pre-game dope- j
j .sters.
The principal item that makes a j
California-Stanford cage game un- |
predictable is Captain Hal Eifert. i
the Bears veteran forward, who
j usually runs wild in the matter of;
ringing up scores. If Eifert can be
stopped, Stanford chances will be
considerably improved. S.C.'s Gut
tero was held to a slim total of
seven points in the second game
last week, so the Indians may be j
able to repeat against the Blue and I
Gold's chief threat.
Pointing for the second game of j
the California series, to be played at 1
1 Berkeley Saturday night, Coach j
| John Bunn sent the reserve section i
' of his rejuvenated basketball team
through a strenuous scrimmage last
! night, while giving the regular '
! quintet a layoff from active work.
With Emil Cowing, scrappy ball- j
hawk, ringing the hoop from all I
angles, the second team finished up j
] their practice game in a virtually I
j dead heat with the third stringers, I
j indicating that Bunn is rapidly de- J
I veloping a capable crew of reserves j
] to back up his starting five.
Free Throws
Topping, Anderson, Edelen, Rog- j
ers, and Mallatratt, the first-string j
! quintet that vanquished the mighty I
! Trojans and Dons, spent their lime I
! shooting free throws. Whether de-'
liberate, unintentional, or otherwise, j
a good many personal fouls are usu- i
ally committed in a Bear-Indian se- I
l ies, making the success or non- j
! success of free throws an important
; factor in the final outcome.
Although Arnie Anderson seems
tc have a grip on the right' forward
post by virtue of his flashy playing
I against S.C. and the University of
San Francisco, Cowings deadeye
I ability will probably earn him a :
: good deal of action in coming games. \
Chances Strong
! Distinctly the underdog in their !
last game with California, the In- j
| dians surprised by holding the Bears !
I fairly even except for the usual
! high-scoring efforts of Hal Eifert. 1
