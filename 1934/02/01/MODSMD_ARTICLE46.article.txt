the forthcoming game to muke it a
big help to charity, according to

Relief Committee.
Although that committee was only
appointed last week one charity
game with the U.S.F. Dons has al
ready been held. The financial re
sults of this game have not yet been
ascertained, due to delays in col
lecting money, gathered from many
widely scattered localities.
