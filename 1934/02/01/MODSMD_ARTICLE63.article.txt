## 
### 
Enrollment in the Depart
ment of Economics has in
creased over 690 per cent dur
ing the 28-year period from
1902-03 to 1930-31. This was
revealed by a study of the
Bawl-outs from past years, and
shows the significance of that
department which was dis
cussed by Professor B. F. Ha
ey, executive head, last night.
Growing from 88 students in
1902-03, the department ex
panded gradually to 131 in
1907-08. In the next 11 years it
grew to a maximum of 635.
Since the creation of the Po
litical Science Department in
1920-21, the enrollment in eco
nomics has had a slump, but it
came up to 418 in 1926-27
when the School of Social Sci
ence was established, to 558 in
1928-29, to 589 in 1929-30, and
down again to 351 in 1932-33.
Number of faculty members
in the department has increased
from five in 1903-04 to seven in
1919-20 to 16 at the present
time.
