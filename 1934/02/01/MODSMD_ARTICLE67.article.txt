# THE 						USE OF GLOBES
## 
### ERNEST DIMNET (Author of The Art of Thinking 
A hundred and throe years ago, Charlotte Bronte, after a
short introduction to school-life and a long rest from it at
home, was again sent to hoarding-sehool. The name of this
school \v;is Hoe Head. It was conducted by an, of course,
old-fashioned Miss Wooler, on old-fashioned lines. The pros
pectus of the establishment gave, the curriculum: the girls
were taught grammar, writing, arithmetic, French, deport
ment, sewing, and embroidery, but they were also taught
something which has completely disappeared from our mod
ern curriculums, viz., the "use of globes." 1 remember being
amused the lirsl lime I came across it, by the pomposity latent
in this phrase. 'J'he re sal the girls, probably with arms over
the end of that back-board without which there would have
been no department, and Miss Wooler would appear carrying
the big globe from the parlour, made shiny, as Dickens testi
fies, by long solitude in a cold, dampish room.
What Miss Wooler said in explanation of the multi-col
oured ball I do not know, but I do know that the globe gave
her a great opportunity lo initiate the girls into world-politics
and the policies of the Duke of Wellington. I myself own a
globe, and 1 am only sorry that 1 came by it pretty late in life
and was not introduced to its use when my memory instead
of being marble lo receive, was wax. and marble at my will.
The contemplations of a globe, with the many questions il
elicits, is one of the most vital intellectual exercises I know of.
Anybody who will try the experiment of indulging in it ten
minutes a day during four weeks will be another person at
the end of the month. For those contours speak; Ihey speak
more clearly than most lecturers, and immeasurably more
directly than most books.
Say what we will, we still imagine the world to be Hat. We
may repeal that il is spjierical, but we see il Mat and 1 know
of university graduates who secretly and medievally wonder
about New Zealanders walking heads down. The globe, by
merely showing us that queer sight, compels us to lake
thought. A glance at the North Atlantic on a map, followed
by one at the same region on a globe, helps us to understand
the ship's captain when he says: "I follow a northern
course; I want to save time."
We love to look on America with her elegant length and
slender waist. How different from heavy-looking Africa! Yes,
but on the fourth or Jifth of our twenty-eight days we shall
probably notice that the contour of Western Africa corre
sponds to that of South America and the conclusion will be
forced upon us that the two continents must have been one
at some remote period, and drifted apart, not on the salty
ocean, but on the semi-lluid surface of the inner lire a few
miles underneath.
How liny little Europe seems on the vast convexity of the
Northern Hemisphere. How evident that it is part of the
huge Asiatic continent, and that Russia, in spile of the Ural
chain (insignificant except in length) is Asiatic and not Euro
pean! What is Europe? Merely that jumble of peninsulas or
long capes stretching away from Asia. The more we look at
il, the better we realise that only intellectual superiority gave
il its historical pre-eminence. Let education become universal,
let thought follow in the train of conquest, and the deep Euro
pean bays will cease to be rich harbours, and the title of a
well-known French book, La Decadence de IKurnpc, will be
come an actuality.
Hut our two-dollar globe is too small lo allow us further
to investigate European conditions comfortably. Let us sup
plement it with a map and, for a few days, give this map our
daily ten minutes' attention. What strikes us at first sight?
That some countries seem to have been created, politically
created, by nature. Islands like Great Britain or Ireland; large
peninsulas protected by mountains where they cease to be
protected by the sea, like Spain or Italy; again, Scandinavia
surrounded by sea or ice, are obviously sclf-suflicient and self
defended. On the contrary, the complication of states in Cen
tral Europe seems inevitable and dangerous. II is obvious that
Poland would lose her independence if she lost the access to
the sea insured her by President Wilson in the thirteenth of
his Fourteen Points. The situation of Czeeho-Slovakia as well
as well as that of her former masters, Austria and Hungary,
far away from any sea, is suffocating. Germany with a fine
length of sea-board and the defense of mighty rivers docs not
look happy on the map, while France, with the exception of
her eastern frontier, is evidently in a privileged position. Bel
gium, squeezed in between Germany, France, and Holland,
and separated from England by a mere ditch, appears to be,
of all countries, the one which must find it hardest to defend
its independence. Switzerland, with the same area arid an
equal population, seems, in comparison, to be in a battle
mentcd castle. Italy is apparently strong, but if we look at
the map long enough we find that the elbow-room which the
Mediterranean gives her is nullified by a capital fact: the
Mediterranean is an interior sea communicating only at two
points—-Suez and Gibraltar—with the ocean. Now the keys
of both these places are kepi in London. Italy can only navi
gate the seven seas with the permission of Britain. Smallest
of all is the Pontifical State, the Vatican City (a hundred
acres). II is defended by all sorts of moral influences stronger
than foils or mountains, but it is only too clear that, should
she he so minded, Italy could cut off the Vatican from the rest
of I lie world in less than half an hour.
Closer and closer scrutiny of the map, with no outside as
sistance from hook or man, mind you, just letting contours
speak for themselves, will disclose other important facts. Keep
your eye a few minutes, for instance, on that most talked-of
region, the Polish Corridor, giving Poland that access to the
sea which Wilson knew was imperatively necessary to her.
Why should that maritime province, Polish Pomerania, be
called a Corridor? Compare il to Belgium, and it is about half
as large. Why give such a large region a name which conjures
up nothing but narrowness? Perhaps you will find the an
swer. II not, I hope to be up at Stanford several weeks next
autumn, when we can discuss hypotheses.
All this the Inmost round globe tells us the moment we hut
look ;il it. I'here are other particulars which it cannot tell,
hut which also cannot he told without l'°i' instance, why
is il a paradox tor Italy to he a revisionist (of the Versailles
Treaty) while revision would he sure to cause her the loss of
three hundred thousand non-Italian subjects and of her best
northern frontier? Here political geography steps in with a
wealth of the most interesting information. You ask: what
should I read? Have you ever thumbed the tiles of Forcii/n
,1 /fairs? Or have you ever glanced at Professor Isaac Bow
man's The Xcw World.' Give il a chance: you will never regret
it. Bui even my friend Hendrik Van Loon's chatty (icojjra-
I'hy. colored though it is by the author's political views, will
supplement the map in the most interesting way. Only begin
tomorrow, your silent conversation with Miss Woolev's globe,
and I can promise you rich rewards.

long capes stretching away from Asia. The more we look at
il, the better we realise that only intellectual superiority gave
il its historical pre-eminence. Let education become universal,
let thought follow in the train of conquest, and the deep Euro
pean bays will cease to be rich harbours, and the title of a
well-known French book, La Decadence de IKurnpc, will be
come an actuality.
Hut our two-dollar globe is too small lo allow us further
to investigate European conditions comfortably. Let us sup
plement it with a map and, for a few days, give this map our
daily ten minutes' attention. What strikes us at first sight?
That some countries seem to have been created, politically
created, by nature. Islands like Great Britain or Ireland; large
peninsulas protected by mountains where they cease to be
protected by the sea, like Spain or Italy; again, Scandinavia
surrounded by sea or ice, are obviously sclf-suflicient and self
defended. On the contrary, the complication of states in Cen
tral Europe seems inevitable and dangerous. II is obvious that
Poland would lose her independence if she lost the access to
the sea insured her by President Wilson in the thirteenth of
his Fourteen Points. The situation of Czeeho-Slovakia as well
as well as that of her former masters, Austria and Hungary,
far away from any sea, is suffocating. Germany with a fine
length of sea-board and the defense of mighty rivers docs not
look happy on the map, while France, with the exception of
her eastern frontier, is evidently in a privileged position. Bel
gium, squeezed in between Germany, France, and Holland,
and separated from England by a mere ditch, appears to be,
of all countries, the one which must find it hardest to defend
its independence. Switzerland, with the same area arid an
equal population, seems, in comparison, to be in a battle
mentcd castle. Italy is apparently strong, but if we look at
the map long enough we find that the elbow-room which the
Mediterranean gives her is nullified by a capital fact: the
Mediterranean is an interior sea communicating only at two
points—-Suez and Gibraltar—with the ocean. Now the keys
of both these places are kepi in London. Italy can only navi
gate the seven seas with the permission of Britain. Smallest
of all is the Pontifical State, the Vatican City (a hundred
acres). II is defended by all sorts of moral influences stronger
than foils or mountains, but it is only too clear that, should
she he so minded, Italy could cut off the Vatican from the rest
of I lie world in less than half an hour.
Closer and closer scrutiny of the map, with no outside as
sistance from hook or man, mind you, just letting contours
speak for themselves, will disclose other important facts. Keep
your eye a few minutes, for instance, on that most talked-of
region, the Polish Corridor, giving Poland that access to the
sea which Wilson knew was imperatively necessary to her.
Why should that maritime province, Polish Pomerania, be
called a Corridor? Compare il to Belgium, and it is about half
as large. Why give such a large region a name which conjures
up nothing but narrowness? Perhaps you will find the an
swer. II not, I hope to be up at Stanford several weeks next
autumn, when we can discuss hypotheses.
All this the Inmost round globe tells us the moment we hut

A hundred and throe years ago, Charlotte Bronte, after a
short introduction to school-life and a long rest from it at
home, was again sent to hoarding-sehool. The name of this
school \v;is Hoe Head. It was conducted by an, of course,
old-fashioned Miss Wooler, on old-fashioned lines. The pros
pectus of the establishment gave, the curriculum: the girls
were taught grammar, writing, arithmetic, French, deport
ment, sewing, and embroidery, but they were also taught
something which has completely disappeared from our mod
ern curriculums, viz., the "use of globes." 1 remember being
amused the lirsl lime I came across it, by the pomposity latent
in this phrase. 'J'he re sal the girls, probably with arms over
the end of that back-board without which there would have
been no department, and Miss Wooler would appear carrying
the big globe from the parlour, made shiny, as Dickens testi
fies, by long solitude in a cold, dampish room.
What Miss Wooler said in explanation of the multi-col
oured ball I do not know, but I do know that the globe gave
her a great opportunity lo initiate the girls into world-politics
and the policies of the Duke of Wellington. I myself own a
globe, and 1 am only sorry that 1 came by it pretty late in life
and was not introduced to its use when my memory instead
of being marble lo receive, was wax. and marble at my will.
The contemplations of a globe, with the many questions il
elicits, is one of the most vital intellectual exercises I know of.
Anybody who will try the experiment of indulging in it ten
minutes a day during four weeks will be another person at
the end of the month. For those contours speak; Ihey speak
more clearly than most lecturers, and immeasurably more
directly than most books.
Say what we will, we still imagine the world to be Hat. We
may repeal that il is spjierical, but we see il Mat and 1 know
of university graduates who secretly and medievally wonder
about New Zealanders walking heads down. The globe, by
merely showing us that queer sight, compels us to lake
thought. A glance at the North Atlantic on a map, followed
by one at the same region on a globe, helps us to understand
the ship's captain when he says: "I follow a northern
course; I want to save time."
We love to look on America with her elegant length and
slender waist. How different from heavy-looking Africa! Yes,
but on the fourth or Jifth of our twenty-eight days we shall
probably notice that the contour of Western Africa corre
sponds to that of South America and the conclusion will be
forced upon us that the two continents must have been one
at some remote period, and drifted apart, not on the salty
ocean, but on the semi-lluid surface of the inner lire a few
miles underneath.
How liny little Europe seems on the vast convexity of the
Northern Hemisphere. How evident that it is part of the
huge Asiatic continent, and that Russia, in spile of the Ural
chain (insignificant except in length) is Asiatic and not Euro
pean! What is Europe? Merely that jumble of peninsulas or
long capes stretching away from Asia. The more we look at

A hundred and throe years ago, Charlotte Bronte, after a
short introduction to school-life and a long rest from it at
home, was again sent to hoarding-sehool. The name of this
school \v;is Hoe Head. It was conducted by an, of course,
old-fashioned Miss Wooler, on old-fashioned lines. The pros
pectus of the establishment gave, the curriculum: the girls
were taught grammar, writing, arithmetic, French, deport
ment, sewing, and embroidery, but they were also taught
something which has completely disappeared from our mod
ern curriculums, viz., the "use of globes." 1 remember being
amused the lirsl lime I came across it, by the pomposity latent
in this phrase. 'J'he re sal the girls, probably with arms over
the end of that back-board without which there would have
been no department, and Miss Wooler would appear carrying
the big globe from the parlour, made shiny, as Dickens testi
fies, by long solitude in a cold, dampish room.
What Miss Wooler said in explanation of the multi-col
oured ball I do not know, but I do know that the globe gave
her a great opportunity lo initiate the girls into world-politics
and the policies of the Duke of Wellington. I myself own a
globe, and 1 am only sorry that 1 came by it pretty late in life
and was not introduced to its use when my memory instead
of being marble lo receive, was wax. and marble at my will.
The contemplations of a globe, with the many questions il
elicits, is one of the most vital intellectual exercises I know of.
Anybody who will try the experiment of indulging in it ten
minutes a day during four weeks will be another person at
the end of the month. For those contours speak; Ihey speak
more clearly than most lecturers, and immeasurably more
directly than most books.
Say what we will, we still imagine the world to be Hat. We
may repeal that il is spjierical, but we see il Mat and 1 know
of university graduates who secretly and medievally wonder
about New Zealanders walking heads down. The globe, by
merely showing us that queer sight, compels us to lake
thought. A glance at the North Atlantic on a map, followed
by one at the same region on a globe, helps us to understand
the ship's captain when he says: "I follow a northern
course; I want to save time."
We love to look on America with her elegant length and
slender waist. How different from heavy-looking Africa! Yes,
but on the fourth or Jifth of our twenty-eight days we shall
probably notice that the contour of Western Africa corre
sponds to that of South America and the conclusion will be
forced upon us that the two continents must have been one
at some remote period, and drifted apart, not on the salty
ocean, but on the semi-lluid surface of the inner lire a few
miles underneath.
How liny little Europe seems on the vast convexity of the
Northern Hemisphere. How evident that it is part of the
huge Asiatic continent, and that Russia, in spile of the Ural
chain (insignificant except in length) is Asiatic and not Euro
pean! What is Europe? Merely that jumble of peninsulas or
long capes stretching away from Asia. The more we look at
il, the better we realise that only intellectual superiority gave
il its historical pre-eminence. Let education become universal,
let thought follow in the train of conquest, and the deep Euro
pean bays will cease to be rich harbours, and the title of a
well-known French book, La Decadence de IKurnpc, will be
come an actuality.
Hut our two-dollar globe is too small lo allow us further
to investigate European conditions comfortably. Let us sup
plement it with a map and, for a few days, give this map our
daily ten minutes' attention. What strikes us at first sight?
That some countries seem to have been created, politically
created, by nature. Islands like Great Britain or Ireland; large
peninsulas protected by mountains where they cease to be
protected by the sea, like Spain or Italy; again, Scandinavia
surrounded by sea or ice, are obviously sclf-suflicient and self
defended. On the contrary, the complication of states in Cen
tral Europe seems inevitable and dangerous. II is obvious that
Poland would lose her independence if she lost the access to
the sea insured her by President Wilson in the thirteenth of
his Fourteen Points. The situation of Czeeho-Slovakia as well
as well as that of her former masters, Austria and Hungary,
far away from any sea, is suffocating. Germany with a fine
length of sea-board and the defense of mighty rivers docs not
look happy on the map, while France, with the exception of
her eastern frontier, is evidently in a privileged position. Bel
gium, squeezed in between Germany, France, and Holland,
and separated from England by a mere ditch, appears to be,
of all countries, the one which must find it hardest to defend
its independence. Switzerland, with the same area arid an
equal population, seems, in comparison, to be in a battle
mentcd castle. Italy is apparently strong, but if we look at
the map long enough we find that the elbow-room which the
Mediterranean gives her is nullified by a capital fact: the
Mediterranean is an interior sea communicating only at two
points—-Suez and Gibraltar—with the ocean. Now the keys
of both these places are kepi in London. Italy can only navi
gate the seven seas with the permission of Britain. Smallest
of all is the Pontifical State, the Vatican City (a hundred
acres). II is defended by all sorts of moral influences stronger
than foils or mountains, but it is only too clear that, should
she he so minded, Italy could cut off the Vatican from the rest
of I lie world in less than half an hour.
Closer and closer scrutiny of the map, with no outside as
sistance from hook or man, mind you, just letting contours
speak for themselves, will disclose other important facts. Keep
your eye a few minutes, for instance, on that most talked-of
region, the Polish Corridor, giving Poland that access to the
sea which Wilson knew was imperatively necessary to her.
Why should that maritime province, Polish Pomerania, be
called a Corridor? Compare il to Belgium, and it is about half
as large. Why give such a large region a name which conjures
up nothing but narrowness? Perhaps you will find the an
swer. II not, I hope to be up at Stanford several weeks next
autumn, when we can discuss hypotheses.

about New Zealanders walking heads down. The globe, by
merely showing us that queer sight, compels us to lake
thought. A glance at the North Atlantic on a map, followed
by one at the same region on a globe, helps us to understand
the ship's captain when he says: "I follow a northern
course; I want to save time."
We love to look on America with her elegant length and
slender waist. How different from heavy-looking Africa! Yes,
but on the fourth or Jifth of our twenty-eight days we shall
probably notice that the contour of Western Africa corre
sponds to that of South America and the conclusion will be
forced upon us that the two continents must have been one
at some remote period, and drifted apart, not on the salty
ocean, but on the semi-lluid surface of the inner lire a few
miles underneath.
How liny little Europe seems on the vast convexity of the
Northern Hemisphere. How evident that it is part of the
huge Asiatic continent, and that Russia, in spile of the Ural
chain (insignificant except in length) is Asiatic and not Euro
pean! What is Europe? Merely that jumble of peninsulas or
long capes stretching away from Asia. The more we look at
il, the better we realise that only intellectual superiority gave
il its historical pre-eminence. Let education become universal,
let thought follow in the train of conquest, and the deep Euro
pean bays will cease to be rich harbours, and the title of a
well-known French book, La Decadence de IKurnpc, will be
come an actuality.
Hut our two-dollar globe is too small lo allow us further
to investigate European conditions comfortably. Let us sup
plement it with a map and, for a few days, give this map our
daily ten minutes' attention. What strikes us at first sight?
That some countries seem to have been created, politically
created, by nature. Islands like Great Britain or Ireland; large
peninsulas protected by mountains where they cease to be
protected by the sea, like Spain or Italy; again, Scandinavia
surrounded by sea or ice, are obviously sclf-suflicient and self
defended. On the contrary, the complication of states in Cen
tral Europe seems inevitable and dangerous. II is obvious that
Poland would lose her independence if she lost the access to
the sea insured her by President Wilson in the thirteenth of
his Fourteen Points. The situation of Czeeho-Slovakia as well
as well as that of her former masters, Austria and Hungary,
far away from any sea, is suffocating. Germany with a fine
length of sea-board and the defense of mighty rivers docs not
look happy on the map, while France, with the exception of
her eastern frontier, is evidently in a privileged position. Bel
gium, squeezed in between Germany, France, and Holland,
and separated from England by a mere ditch, appears to be,
of all countries, the one which must find it hardest to defend
its independence. Switzerland, with the same area arid an
equal population, seems, in comparison, to be in a battle
mentcd castle. Italy is apparently strong, but if we look at
the map long enough we find that the elbow-room which the
Mediterranean gives her is nullified by a capital fact: the
Mediterranean is an interior sea communicating only at two
points—-Suez and Gibraltar—with the ocean. Now the keys
of both these places are kepi in London. Italy can only navi
gate the seven seas with the permission of Britain. Smallest
of all is the Pontifical State, the Vatican City (a hundred
acres). II is defended by all sorts of moral influences stronger
than foils or mountains, but it is only too clear that, should
she he so minded, Italy could cut off the Vatican from the rest
of I lie world in less than half an hour.
Closer and closer scrutiny of the map, with no outside as
sistance from hook or man, mind you, just letting contours
speak for themselves, will disclose other important facts. Keep
your eye a few minutes, for instance, on that most talked-of
region, the Polish Corridor, giving Poland that access to the
sea which Wilson knew was imperatively necessary to her.
Why should that maritime province, Polish Pomerania, be
called a Corridor? Compare il to Belgium, and it is about half
as large. Why give such a large region a name which conjures
up nothing but narrowness? Perhaps you will find the an
swer. II not, I hope to be up at Stanford several weeks next
autumn, when we can discuss hypotheses.
All this the Inmost round globe tells us the moment we hut
look ;il it. I'here are other particulars which it cannot tell,
hut which also cannot he told without l'°i' instance, why
is il a paradox tor Italy to he a revisionist (of the Versailles
Treaty) while revision would he sure to cause her the loss of
three hundred thousand non-Italian subjects and of her best
northern frontier? Here political geography steps in with a
wealth of the most interesting information. You ask: what
should I read? Have you ever thumbed the tiles of Forcii/n
,1 /fairs? Or have you ever glanced at Professor Isaac Bow
man's The Xcw World.' Give il a chance: you will never regret
it. Bui even my friend Hendrik Van Loon's chatty (icojjra-
I'hy. colored though it is by the author's political views, will
supplement the map in the most interesting way. Only begin
tomorrow, your silent conversation with Miss Woolev's globe,
and I can promise you rich rewards.
A hundred and throe years ago, Charlotte Bronte, after a
short introduction to school-life and a long rest from it at
home, was again sent to hoarding-sehool. The name of this
school \v;is Hoe Head. It was conducted by an, of course,
old-fashioned Miss Wooler, on old-fashioned lines. The pros
pectus of the establishment gave, the curriculum: the girls
were taught grammar, writing, arithmetic, French, deport
ment, sewing, and embroidery, but they were also taught
something which has completely disappeared from our mod
ern curriculums, viz., the "use of globes." 1 remember being
amused the lirsl lime I came across it, by the pomposity latent
in this phrase. 'J'he re sal the girls, probably with arms over
the end of that back-board without which there would have
been no department, and Miss Wooler would appear carrying
the big globe from the parlour, made shiny, as Dickens testi
fies, by long solitude in a cold, dampish room.
What Miss Wooler said in explanation of the multi-col
oured ball I do not know, but I do know that the globe gave
her a great opportunity lo initiate the girls into world-politics
and the policies of the Duke of Wellington. I myself own a
globe, and 1 am only sorry that 1 came by it pretty late in life
and was not introduced to its use when my memory instead
of being marble lo receive, was wax. and marble at my will.
The contemplations of a globe, with the many questions il
elicits, is one of the most vital intellectual exercises I know of.
Anybody who will try the experiment of indulging in it ten
minutes a day during four weeks will be another person at
the end of the month. For those contours speak; Ihey speak
more clearly than most lecturers, and immeasurably more
directly than most books.
Say what we will, we still imagine the world to be Hat. We
may repeal that il is spjierical, but we see il Mat and 1 know
