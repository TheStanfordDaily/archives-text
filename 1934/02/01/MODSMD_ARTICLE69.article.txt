### CHIYE MORI 
Shipped by aulinnn minds, the tree
Stands in bare and ancient shame,
Each glossy leaf il nourished long
Surrendered lo earth's final* claim.
They have dropped about his feet
Who stands in what mas gracious shade,
Sharpened now to outlined shadow
Thai across his face is laid.
The restless feet without di reel ion
In their paced symbolic tread,
Wearing down the leafy flesh,
Reveal Ihe veins as fine as thread.
From such ruins, he, emerging,
Knows not where lo I urn his face.
And what ret real? Remembering not
What path he came nor from what place!
Enriched by fallen leaves and rain
New leaves again the tree will rear,
And drop again in ageless trust.
Mnemonics for llie falling year!
