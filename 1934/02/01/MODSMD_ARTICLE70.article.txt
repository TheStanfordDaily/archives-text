# Draft of Ezra Pound
## 
### WILL WILLIAMS 
Regardless of what may be the final estimate of Ezra
Pound, he has been at the vortex of modern poetry for a long,
long lime. He is a creative force and the focusing point of
any attempt to draw order from the chaos of seemingly per
verse mystification present in much modern writing, fie has
for more than twenty years been one of the most ostentatious
figures on the literary scene.
Recently, after years of difficult availability, an American
publisher has had the foresight, or altruism, as lime alone
must demonstrate, to issue the Draft of XXX Cantos for a
bit more general circulation than I hey enjoyed previously.
This means that all Pound's poetry is now within the reach
of the average reader, economically if not intellectually. Per
sonae, published in 192t), collected all his work np to that
time. The Cantos complete the list. His rather irresponsible
prose is, perhaps fortunately, still reserved for the esoteric in
expensive limited editions and various lloating reviews. There
fore this evaluation of Pound will he based on the work in
cluded in these two books.
It must be realized that Pound began not as an aesthetic
philosopher, but as an academician. He embraced scholar
ship, yet, in spite of an M.A. taken at the University of Penn
sylvania, was accused of being a "Latin Quarter type." He
was then seduced by the muses to undertake the creative life.
He has been wavering between the two ever since. The net
result is that there is now so much pedantic learning in his
poetry that few can follow his references, and so much poetic
fancy in his critical and academic writing that scholars dis
credit him. This might be taken as a warning to those who
would draw young poets into the maw of classical research.
It is my belief that a truly great dramatic poel was lost
somewhere in the maze of theory. His dramatic monologue is,
when he cares to use it coherently, better than that of Brown
ing. His technique is perfect. His articulation is complete.
But, in spite of all these things, he is a pedagogue gone wrong.
Because of this conflict in his work, Pound has become a
belligerent. He is a master of the use of invective. The skep
tical are referred to his opinion published in Poetry, for .Jan
uary 1933, of Allen Tate's review of Ilow to Head.
His poetry has been described as a persona, or mask, of
the lype through which actors of the early theater spoke their
lines. His persona is one which permits to be heard the voices
of those whom he wishes us to hear. They are replete with
echoes from Latin, Greek, Provencal, Chinese, Italian, and the
late nineteenth century poets. They are not merely imitations,
they are echoes in which the voice of Pound is blended with
that of other voices. Pound becomes personae as well as per
sona.
Fortunately, Pound's obscurities arc not difficulties which
obstruct the Cantos, because they are disjunct from them.
The Cantos can be valuable reading if one has but a sketchy
idea of the theme, which is simple enough. He is clearly pass
ing under review "all that matters" in the epochs of history.
He is marshalling them in a grand parade, which misses the
effect of parade only because he has discarded the traditional
means of narration and depends upon image, free association,
and anecdote. The purpose is criticism, and that criticism is
the best of all criticism, the criticism of purely objective de
scription.
The Cantos arc a survey of history in a timeless sense. He
arrests lime, fastens it for a moment on a microscope slide
and employs the image as a sort of f'xalif to keep it intact.
History becomes a mine of images. He fuses . -"ocialions and
tones in a transitionless juxtaposition. His elaborate docu
mentation is a technique as skillfully used as his verbal coun
terpoint.
Mr. Pound began as an Imagisl and never quite got over
it. With him the style and meaning are identified, or as much
of them as are good poetry. The use of image, which is a
method, also becomes an end. To Ihis extent he is entirely
surface and texture and sensitive rhetoric. He compares with
Stevens in this respect; but where Stevens' mind is concerned
with subtle precisions and infinite ambiguity, Pound produces
verbal images which are seen in the mind's eye and there
exhaust their meaning.
His verse is melodicallv perfect and developed lo an awe
somely expressive degree. It is: ". . . a focusing of the mind
on a given definition of form, or rhythm, so intensely that it
becomes not only more aware of that given form, but more
sensitive to all other forms, rhythms, defined planes or
masses ... It is a sharpening of verbal perceptions."
The use of image has a hannohie all ils own, one which,
not being sonal, can only be recognized emotionally. 11, like
