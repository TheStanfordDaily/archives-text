## THE 						YOUTH OF JOHN STAVELY 
### BY HOWARD BAKER 
John Stavcly was one of the youth which grew lip in Amer
ica after the War. The decade of the Twenties comprised for
him the years in college, and the years before and after col
lege. Jleforc college he was the low-headed son of his parents,
a country hoy, hut a hoy of a country—a great valley in Cali
fornia—which was becoming already urbanized. His father,
a retiring, hardy man, who out of a self-effacing nature put a
large share of responsibility on his family, expected the young
Jack to perform all the tasks involved in Ihe raising of
oranges. The hoy did irrigate and prune; he heaved the boxes
of oranges onto the trucks during Ihe harvests; he operated,
repaired, and tuned the farm machinery. In Ihe falls, when
the work lessened, he shot the blue, crested valley quail with
a twelve-gauge gun that roared like sudden thunder in the
spick and span orchards.
These years he also went to high school. There is, how
ever, little to be recorded about what happened in those class
rooms. For here the healthy, uproarious youngsters of the
countryside gathered at the feet of chattering teachers, who
feigned filling the periods with anecdotal attention to current
events, to those soft and endless verses about King Arthur,
or who ruled majestically over the ignorant children by in
structing them in the miracle of carbon bisulphide. Into these
rooms Latin and Greek never entered, save in the form of the
lonely letters on the pin which adorned the bosom of Miss
White; but Miss White taught only one year before she mar
ried and went away. The language of the school was Spanish.
English was not a language; no one, in those sunny rooms,
ever fretted over its grammar. Economics was the prized sub
ject, for in economics the school could be put completely
behind, the students could visit the chain stores and observe
economics at work; the students always enjoyed their work
when a part of the accomplishing of it consisted in crowding
into automobiles and riding about. Or representatives of the
great hydroelectric power company often would come with
their movie projectors to lecture on economics.
In regard to the early education of John Stavcly, it might
be added that the school operated a fleet of auto buses, which
transported the students from miles around, in great comfort,
with no waste of time. The buses were powered with smooth
six-cylinder motors and had sweeping low bodies which, as
everyone in the community knew, were custom-built. The boy
John Stavcly drove one of them during his last years in that
school. He spent his wages at first for guns and then suddenly
—out of some normal but obscure and unpredictable inclina
tion —for reprints of such iconoclastic works as the essays of
Thomas Paine and the plays of Ibsen and Shaw.
He played Jhe games of the day, particularly football, in
which he and his comrades were both deft and furious. They
were coached by the community banker, a big man who was
cat-like in his manner and his movements and who had been j
shortly before himself a celebrated player. Among the boys j
who played football there were several who had served in the
Navy during the War and had come back from dark vigils on
the Atlantic to play lustily and sing ribald songs in the train
ing-quarters in the brilliant fall evenings after practice. They
played up and down the state one season, winning continually, j
but losing finally to a team which was directed by a most able !
coach. This man, whose salary was a scandal in the surround-1
ing counties, was reputed to have introduced the tactics of a !
successful university, that is to say, he taught his boys how !
to block aj)d tackle beautifully, and how to hold the key de-1
fensive player illegally but inconspicuously when their offense j
came to a crucial point. John Stavcly and his comrades bowed j
sadly, with resignation and some little wonder, at such supe- '
rior finesse.
One spring in these years the noy trailed devotedly after |
Ihe vivacious and erratic footsteps of a little golden-haired
class-mate. She was active in the church where the boy had
habitually gone with his parents, and so he calmly accepted
it as his duly to plan to transport her and himself some day !
to Ihe Alaskan wilderness where they would minister unto
the heathen. Since this resolve occurred at the same time that j
he was reading Thomas Paine, it might he noted that the min-1
islrations which he contemplated were doubtless to have been
humanitarian rather than theological, but of course he prob-.
ably did not bother about this problem at all. He never com
municated the project to the girl. In fact, although he fol- i
lowed assiduously after the living hair and the fresh cheek,
the figure swaddled in a red flannel blouse and a white flannel
skirt, he never quite caught up with her.
In the end il was his excursions into the lands of the
bogeys, the shadowy lands of Paine and Marx and the less
fearsome ones of Shaw and Wells, which sent him olf to col
lege with the blessings of his elders upon him. For these good
people, his parents, his teachers, the friends of his family, the 1
Presbyterian minister, a lame old Scotsman whose adherence
to stiff theology was a beautiful thing in a time when preach
ers as a whole w'ere pumping a pompous and blurred liberal
ism over the pulpits, but a beautiful thing which the boy was
entirely 100 young to appreciate—these good people disap
proved of the dwious paths which they discovered the boy's
mind was taking, and yet they regarded his inclinations as a
healthy and promising sign of future powers. Perhaps his
lack of ostentation in his waywardness won them over: they
did not feel called upon to disapprove severely, they could
toward which he was striking out, but since il seemed dubi
ous, they for their parts—well, they would have to shake their
heads when they considered it. These good people, however
lax and confused the ways into which they had fallen, were
rich in common humanity.
Still his going to college was not remarkable, for he grew
up in a lime when a college education was at once sincerely
respected and at the same lime regarded as available to any
one, irrespective of bis training, who cared to have it. A num
ber of his friends went too, and of these a pari were girls. Hut
a few years earlier, when his eldest sister had finished high
school, she had promptly married, with no thought of doing
anything else, and soon had children of her own to send to
school.
Times had changed. His molhcr packed his suitcase for
him, and the whole family went with him to the railroad sta
tion.

fornia—which was becoming already urbanized. His father,
a retiring, hardy man, who out of a self-effacing nature put a
large share of responsibility on his family, expected the young
Jack to perform all the tasks involved in Ihe raising of
oranges. The hoy did irrigate and prune; he heaved the boxes
of oranges onto the trucks during Ihe harvests; he operated,
repaired, and tuned the farm machinery. In Ihe falls, when
the work lessened, he shot the blue, crested valley quail with
a twelve-gauge gun that roared like sudden thunder in the
spick and span orchards.
These years he also went to high school. There is, how
ever, little to be recorded about what happened in those class
rooms. For here the healthy, uproarious youngsters of the
countryside gathered at the feet of chattering teachers, who
feigned filling the periods with anecdotal attention to current
events, to those soft and endless verses about King Arthur,
or who ruled majestically over the ignorant children by in
structing them in the miracle of carbon bisulphide. Into these
rooms Latin and Greek never entered, save in the form of the
lonely letters on the pin which adorned the bosom of Miss
White; but Miss White taught only one year before she mar
ried and went away. The language of the school was Spanish.
English was not a language; no one, in those sunny rooms,
ever fretted over its grammar. Economics was the prized sub
ject, for in economics the school could be put completely
behind, the students could visit the chain stores and observe
economics at work; the students always enjoyed their work
when a part of the accomplishing of it consisted in crowding
into automobiles and riding about. Or representatives of the
great hydroelectric power company often would come with
their movie projectors to lecture on economics.
In regard to the early education of John Stavcly, it might
be added that the school operated a fleet of auto buses, which
transported the students from miles around, in great comfort,
with no waste of time. The buses were powered with smooth
six-cylinder motors and had sweeping low bodies which, as
everyone in the community knew, were custom-built. The boy
John Stavcly drove one of them during his last years in that
school. He spent his wages at first for guns and then suddenly
—out of some normal but obscure and unpredictable inclina
tion —for reprints of such iconoclastic works as the essays of
Thomas Paine and the plays of Ibsen and Shaw.
He played Jhe games of the day, particularly football, in
which he and his comrades were both deft and furious. They
were coached by the community banker, a big man who was
cat-like in his manner and his movements and who had been j
shortly before himself a celebrated player. Among the boys j
who played football there were several who had served in the
Navy during the War and had come back from dark vigils on
the Atlantic to play lustily and sing ribald songs in the train
ing-quarters in the brilliant fall evenings after practice. They
played up and down the state one season, winning continually, j
but losing finally to a team which was directed by a most able !
coach. This man, whose salary was a scandal in the surround-1
ing counties, was reputed to have introduced the tactics of a !
successful university, that is to say, he taught his boys how !
to block aj)d tackle beautifully, and how to hold the key de-1
fensive player illegally but inconspicuously when their offense j
came to a crucial point. John Stavcly and his comrades bowed j
sadly, with resignation and some little wonder, at such supe- '
rior finesse.
One spring in these years the noy trailed devotedly after |
Ihe vivacious and erratic footsteps of a little golden-haired
class-mate. She was active in the church where the boy had
habitually gone with his parents, and so he calmly accepted
it as his duly to plan to transport her and himself some day !
to Ihe Alaskan wilderness where they would minister unto
the heathen. Since this resolve occurred at the same time that j
he was reading Thomas Paine, it might he noted that the min-1
islrations which he contemplated were doubtless to have been
humanitarian rather than theological, but of course he prob-.
ably did not bother about this problem at all. He never com
municated the project to the girl. In fact, although he fol- i
lowed assiduously after the living hair and the fresh cheek,
the figure swaddled in a red flannel blouse and a white flannel
skirt, he never quite caught up with her.
In the end il was his excursions into the lands of the
bogeys, the shadowy lands of Paine and Marx and the less
fearsome ones of Shaw and Wells, which sent him olf to col
lege with the blessings of his elders upon him. For these good
people, his parents, his teachers, the friends of his family, the 1
Presbyterian minister, a lame old Scotsman whose adherence
to stiff theology was a beautiful thing in a time when preach
ers as a whole w'ere pumping a pompous and blurred liberal
ism over the pulpits, but a beautiful thing which the boy was
entirely 100 young to appreciate—these good people disap
proved of the dwious paths which they discovered the boy's
mind was taking, and yet they regarded his inclinations as a
healthy and promising sign of future powers. Perhaps his
lack of ostentation in his waywardness won them over: they
did not feel called upon to disapprove severely, they could
toward which he was striking out, but since il seemed dubi
ous, they for their parts—well, they would have to shake their
heads when they considered it. These good people, however
lax and confused the ways into which they had fallen, were
rich in common humanity.
Still his going to college was not remarkable, for he grew
up in a lime when a college education was at once sincerely
respected and at the same lime regarded as available to any
one, irrespective of bis training, who cared to have it. A num
ber of his friends went too, and of these a pari were girls. Hut
a few years earlier, when his eldest sister had finished high
school, she had promptly married, with no thought of doing
anything else, and soon had children of her own to send to
school.
Times had changed. His molhcr packed his suitcase for
him, and the whole family went with him to the railroad sta
tion.

of oranges onto the trucks during Ihe harvests; he operated,
repaired, and tuned the farm machinery. In Ihe falls, when
the work lessened, he shot the blue, crested valley quail with
a twelve-gauge gun that roared like sudden thunder in the
spick and span orchards.
These years he also went to high school. There is, how
ever, little to be recorded about what happened in those class
rooms. For here the healthy, uproarious youngsters of the
countryside gathered at the feet of chattering teachers, who
feigned filling the periods with anecdotal attention to current
events, to those soft and endless verses about King Arthur,
or who ruled majestically over the ignorant children by in
structing them in the miracle of carbon bisulphide. Into these
rooms Latin and Greek never entered, save in the form of the
lonely letters on the pin which adorned the bosom of Miss
White; but Miss White taught only one year before she mar
ried and went away. The language of the school was Spanish.
English was not a language; no one, in those sunny rooms,
ever fretted over its grammar. Economics was the prized sub
ject, for in economics the school could be put completely
behind, the students could visit the chain stores and observe
economics at work; the students always enjoyed their work
when a part of the accomplishing of it consisted in crowding
into automobiles and riding about. Or representatives of the
great hydroelectric power company often would come with
their movie projectors to lecture on economics.
In regard to the early education of John Stavcly, it might
be added that the school operated a fleet of auto buses, which
transported the students from miles around, in great comfort,
with no waste of time. The buses were powered with smooth
six-cylinder motors and had sweeping low bodies which, as
everyone in the community knew, were custom-built. The boy
John Stavcly drove one of them during his last years in that
school. He spent his wages at first for guns and then suddenly
—out of some normal but obscure and unpredictable inclina
tion —for reprints of such iconoclastic works as the essays of
Thomas Paine and the plays of Ibsen and Shaw.
He played Jhe games of the day, particularly football, in
which he and his comrades were both deft and furious. They
were coached by the community banker, a big man who was
cat-like in his manner and his movements and who had been j
shortly before himself a celebrated player. Among the boys j
who played football there were several who had served in the
Navy during the War and had come back from dark vigils on
the Atlantic to play lustily and sing ribald songs in the train
ing-quarters in the brilliant fall evenings after practice. They
played up and down the state one season, winning continually, j
but losing finally to a team which was directed by a most able !
coach. This man, whose salary was a scandal in the surround-1
ing counties, was reputed to have introduced the tactics of a !
successful university, that is to say, he taught his boys how !
to block aj)d tackle beautifully, and how to hold the key de-1
fensive player illegally but inconspicuously when their offense j
came to a crucial point. John Stavcly and his comrades bowed j
sadly, with resignation and some little wonder, at such supe- '
rior finesse.
One spring in these years the noy trailed devotedly after |
Ihe vivacious and erratic footsteps of a little golden-haired
class-mate. She was active in the church where the boy had
habitually gone with his parents, and so he calmly accepted
it as his duly to plan to transport her and himself some day !
to Ihe Alaskan wilderness where they would minister unto
the heathen. Since this resolve occurred at the same time that j
he was reading Thomas Paine, it might he noted that the min-1
islrations which he contemplated were doubtless to have been
humanitarian rather than theological, but of course he prob-.
ably did not bother about this problem at all. He never com
municated the project to the girl. In fact, although he fol- i
lowed assiduously after the living hair and the fresh cheek,
the figure swaddled in a red flannel blouse and a white flannel
skirt, he never quite caught up with her.
In the end il was his excursions into the lands of the
bogeys, the shadowy lands of Paine and Marx and the less
fearsome ones of Shaw and Wells, which sent him olf to col
lege with the blessings of his elders upon him. For these good
people, his parents, his teachers, the friends of his family, the 1
Presbyterian minister, a lame old Scotsman whose adherence
to stiff theology was a beautiful thing in a time when preach
ers as a whole w'ere pumping a pompous and blurred liberal
ism over the pulpits, but a beautiful thing which the boy was
entirely 100 young to appreciate—these good people disap
proved of the dwious paths which they discovered the boy's
mind was taking, and yet they regarded his inclinations as a
healthy and promising sign of future powers. Perhaps his
lack of ostentation in his waywardness won them over: they
did not feel called upon to disapprove severely, they could
toward which he was striking out, but since il seemed dubi
ous, they for their parts—well, they would have to shake their
heads when they considered it. These good people, however
lax and confused the ways into which they had fallen, were
rich in common humanity.
Still his going to college was not remarkable, for he grew
up in a lime when a college education was at once sincerely
respected and at the same lime regarded as available to any
one, irrespective of bis training, who cared to have it. A num
ber of his friends went too, and of these a pari were girls. Hut
a few years earlier, when his eldest sister had finished high
school, she had promptly married, with no thought of doing
anything else, and soon had children of her own to send to
school.
Times had changed. His molhcr packed his suitcase for
him, and the whole family went with him to the railroad sta
tion.
John Stavcly was one of the youth which grew lip in Amer
ica after the War. The decade of the Twenties comprised for
him the years in college, and the years before and after col
lege. Jleforc college he was the low-headed son of his parents,
a country hoy, hut a hoy of a country—a great valley in Cali
fornia—which was becoming already urbanized. His father,
a retiring, hardy man, who out of a self-effacing nature put a
large share of responsibility on his family, expected the young
Jack to perform all the tasks involved in Ihe raising of
