# A 						SUMMER VACATION

When .John Slavel.v \v:is in collegc lie usually went home
during Ihe slimmer vacations lo help with Hie work on his

' family's ranches in tlie San Joaquin Valley. He spent Ihc
summer of 15)12-1, however, in Sacramento, in the home of an
uncle, his lather's brother, who was that summer active in
the presidential campaign of La Follelle. His uncle was quite

headquarters a perversity which alarmed even his easy-going
j uncle. Here, in the converted store across from the railroad
j yards, the hoy in his still' and shiny straw hat was calmly
; ignored hy the men, mostly lumbermen, who sal about in
| grimy caps, playing checkers and arguing endlessly. I lis quick
wits and friendliness did not take in these men.
This was the lirst lime that he had ever been foot-loose in
a city. As might be expected, he observed prostitutes, who
i came and went from boarding-houses with cracked and faded
siding, more closely than he did politicians. He noticed that
the garage down town, where his uncle parked his car, re
tained the smell of a livery stable, as if the modernization had
been accomplished only yesterday; and that the county jail
could be identified from afar by its smell of carbolic and
onions.
Nevertheless he came home with warm admiration for
candidate La Folleltc. Indeed, the warmth of his admiration
was the beginning of a breach between him and his father.
This matter of supporting one candidate rather than another,
while so inconsiderable a thing in itself, served to make the
father realize for the lirst time that his boy was in funda
mental disagreement with him. The son accused the father of
being blind to all virtues except those labeled virtuous by the
parly which he had habitually supported. The father replied:
"Well, maybe so. Maybe so. Why, in Emmilsburg, Mary
land, when I was your age, I carried a torch in every Republi
can parade." The father laughed. "Yes sir, in every parade."
He had never before admitted, and doubtless had never rec
ognized, that he was strictly a party man.
The boy was bitter and implacable, particularly because
it seemed to him that, without the early adoption of a great
socialistic enterprise, they and many of the farmers of the
stale were confronted by ruin. The farmers had always
pumped water from wells and had used electric power; but
with the water strata drying up under the land, pumping was
becoming no longer posible. Surface water could be brought
in only by a system of canals which would have to be so vast
and stretch so far that only the state could build them. The
power companies opposed such a project, both openly and
anonymously in the local newspapers which they subsidized.
The farmers, nearly every one of whom had bought a share
or two of power stock at bargain prices, shied away from the
specter of subversion and prayed to God that somehow while
their pumps whirled the water level would rise.
With smoldering bewilderment the youth tried to grasp
the point of view of his father. After a while he began to
realize that the issue was not so clear as it seemed in his
imagination. While il was quite true that these very farmers
had banded together in a most communal of organizations—•
they could not pick an orange until their slate-wide organiza
tion permitted them to do so—still il did not by any means
follow that, even if they recognized the socialistic tendency in
their industry, they were prepared to take other socialistic
steps. They were not stupid to be cautious. They apparently
had a sound instinct which led them to dread the ramifications
of any real innovation. If they had plenty of water, for in
stance, they would raise such a surplus of crops that the val
leys would blaze with fires of cotton and the orange dumps
would form a new line of foothills. This prospect gave Ihe boy
but little pause, for he could respond thai this was a problem
simply to be solved by controlled production and better dis
tribution. Although he could respond perhaps a little 100
glibly, he did not lack the sense to know what he was saying:
he saw that .his response implied a drastic change not only
in the social constitution of his nation hut in that of the world.
It would be a change so vast that il made him drunk to con
template it. He was excited by il and enamored of if. And not
being able to see where it would end not being able to cope
with its inevitable ramifications, just as his lather was unable
to cope with ramifications, his vision of change brought to
him a failing of heart, a strong, impersonal sense of doom.
When he held the sleek words production and distribution
up to the light, he wondered whether, for instance, oranges
should be grown where his family and the others had chosen
to try to grow them: the location was too far from markets,
winters were too cold, and water —water was disappearing
from that corner of the continent. The very cities of the world
had risen, and fallen, as monuments to hazard.
The bent of his ideas did not change; he loved the power
companies no more than before and lie still disagreed sharply
with his father. But his ideas were becoming solider than
abstract toys; where they had flown vividly one after another
like faces in a dream, he was embodying them now with his
own flesh and blood. And his llesh and blood, which was in
a way the common llesh and blood of humanity, transfused
his ideas with their inherent weakness and sorrow. He was
growing up. He had to adjust mind and matter in many more
fields, but the present fruit of his growth was at least an un
derstanding of his father. This understanding perhaps more
than made up for the .blind devotion which now was lost.
His family, however, never doubted that they had been
quite right not to condone the wild-haired notions with which
he had come back from Sacramento. Had not his uncle, soon
after that summer of 1924, taken to breeding greyhounds and
racing them on Ihc tracks?
