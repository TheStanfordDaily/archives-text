# REGIONALISM:
## A Commentary
### 
The continued interest in regional fiction was one of two
outstanding characteristics of the past year in American lit
erature. The second characteristic, a romantic avidity lor
historical books, was essentially a reaction to the first.
Every week during 1933 saw new works by writers who
had become conscious of the historical or ethnological signifi
cance of distinct regions, and had developed this conscious
ness in either verse or prose. Let us pass in review, lor in
stance, a few of the novels which appeared during the autumn
of 1933. II is surprising to find that very nearly one-half of
the prose fiction which has appeared since September is of
definitely regional tone and interest.
The end of the summer saw "As the Earth Turns" and
"South Moon Under" still high among the best sellers. Early
in September, Vermont joined Maine and Florida in the pub
lic favor with Ihe publication of "Mis' Stone"—a volume of
stories by Francis Miller Hoyt, and "A Mountain Township"
—poems by Walter Hard. Dorothy Canfield, who wrote the
introduction to Mr. Hard's volume, added to the Vermont
collection a few weeks later her finest novel, "Bonfire." Two
other excellent regional novels were published late in Sep
tember: Louis Bromfield's "The Farm" (Middle West) and
"Two Valleys" (Western Alleghenies before the Revolution)
by Howard Mclvin Fast.
In October, the South regained its regional pre-eminence
of past years. Erskine Caldwell's "We Are the Living" met
with critical approval and financial success. Edwin (iran
berry: "High Water" (Florida), Caroline Miller: "Lain!) in
His Bosom'" (Georgia in pioneer days), and Emmell Gowen's
very fine "Dark Moon of March" (Tennessee hills) were dis
tinguished either by excellent writing or by careful attention
to the history of the region. A few weeks later, the frontier
was treated in Honore Morrow's "Argonaut," a decided frost,
and the Dakotas appeared in "There's Always Another Year"
by Martha Ostenso.
The Ozarks, perennial subjects for regional authors, are
still popular. During November, Thames Williamson pub
lished a novel, "The Woods Colt," and Vincent Randolph of
fered ii collection of stories and anecdotes, "From an Ozark
Hollow."
California, and particularly San Francisco, has not been
neglected in this literary stampede. Charles Caldwell Dobie's
"San Francisco: a Pageant" and Ruth Comfort Mitchell's "Old
Sau Francisco" (a collection of four stories which can only be
appreciated by San Franciscans of long standing) gained a
certain amount of attention, although their moderate success
was put to shame by that phenomenal best-seller "The Bar
bary Coast." The three books, of course, are too different to
bear comparison.
The list of regional novels is immense; to attempt to keep
up with the entire bulk would demand a critical perpetual
motion, which, unfortunately for such astute business men
as Arnold Bennett, has not been discovered. I will only note
in concluding this summary that within a very few days, two
river-boat novels appeared—Ben Lucien Burman: "Steamboat
Round the Bend" (Mississippi) and Frederick Way, .Jr.: "Log
of the Becky Ann" (Ohio).
The terms re(/ionalisui, .sectionalism, and I radii ion have
become so (inn a part of the American critic's vocabulary that
flic words themselves have lost all firmness. This is a familiar
etymological phenomenon: words of definite meaning and
emphasis, when they are adopted by the critics, almost imme
diately lose their original connotation, and become objects of
controversy.
Such a phenomenon, for instance, becomes only 100 evi
dent when one reads such an essay as Allen Tate's "Region
alism and Sectionalism" ("New Republic," December 123,
1931). Tale's definitions, which are certainly as good as any,
identify regionalism with tradition and sectionalism with
politics. Sectionalism aggressively compares its own features
with those of another community; Ibis is a kind of politics.
It is a self-conscious movement and attitude. Regionalism, on
the other hand, is not conscious of itself as a figure in an
abstract scale of values; it is the cultivation of a firm manner
and sense of life such as is necessary lo the artist. This or
ganic sense is frequently afforded by tradition —if that tradi
tion (i.e., individual selection and arrangement) operates un
consciously. Genuine tradition is absorbed without effort, and
hence effects a rigid economy, both in literature and in life.
For the sake of convenience, a more exact definition may
be avoided. But certainly it is misleading lo make an arbi
trary distinction between regionalism and sectionalism; it is
more convenient to say good regionalism and bad regionalism.
The cultivation of regional art, in so far as it is disinter
ested and living,.rather than antiquarian, is to be encouraged.
But what are regional art and regional Itierature? What are
the characteristics of a region? The Southwest may bring to
mind Indian culture; Ihe South, Negro culture. Why are these
regional (i.e., apart from national.) characteristics? Primarily,
because they form the lines of an exceptional aesthetic; I hey
are the unassimilated elements in a civilization which is pre
dominantly white and aristocratic. II Negro or Indian life is
no longer natural to the region, neither is the recording of
conscious tradition. This recording is nntiquariunisni, an alti
tude certain to end in sterilization of the artistic spirit, a gen
tlemanly "decadence," and eventually, the morbidity of docu
ment.
Regionalism, then, is justified as such only when it seeks
to foster lining forms of art. The architectural preservation
of Santa Fe, for instance, is eminently worth while; these
buildings are not historical relies, but the expression of an
aesthetic definitely congenial lo the one regional element
which must be accepted without question: geographical en
's iron men I.
The greatest danger of regionalism, I hen, is ils tendency
to go beyond itself. Self-consciousness, the-self-consciousness
which results in one-man magazines and snobbery, is to be
avoided. Regionalism, like tradition, does not exist when it
becomes self-conscious, and hence artificial.
The reference and application to literature is fairly clear.
Writers should not attempt to reproduce Ihe "Puritan tradi
tion" or the "Southern tradition"; they will do so if they are
a part of these traditions; if they are not, failure is imminent.
In brief, writers should not attempt to Ihrusl a narrow view
of art upon the wide world. The novelist should write about
the relationship between man and man, rather than about the
relationship between man and region or man and tradition.
If the writer is intelligent, he will absorb without ostentation
or research the tradition and regional altitude in which he is
at home. He will realize that narrow regionalism, which is at
Ihe basis of Ihe social disaster of nationalistic politics, is
equally.deadly in art.
The ethical man, cither in creative art or in creative living,
should he regional, national, and international. Dante was a
Florentine, to be sure; but he was also a thorough llalian,
and most of all a citizen of medieval Europe.
