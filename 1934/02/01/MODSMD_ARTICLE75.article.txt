# SYMPATHY AND COMEDY
## 
### BY MARGERY BAILEY 
To add one more discussion lo the long list jiow extant J
concerning comedy and the comic spirit seems not so much j
a last straw as it is a waste of time; my only justification in
writing this paper is that I do not attempt a new definition of]
comedy nor add any further complexities, but that by pointing
out certain disregarded distinctions in the definitions already j
known, I hope to clarify somewhat the entanglement which
in these days prevails. The chief difficulty facing any modern
who attempts to discover precisely what comedy and the
comic may be, is the vagueness which surrounds these terms
and the plays written on the basis of that vagueness. In part,
the haziness of critics and writers is the result of an amiable j
wish to regard as comic everything which is not downright j
sad; in part it springs from a tendency to sentimentalize hu
mor, after the romantic fashion begun in the eighteenth cen
tury; in part it is sheer confusion of the elements of the
comic spirit with the methods of comedy (two differing
things). In general, the fashion is to assert that the chief j
source and the aim of the comic is sympathy.
It is necessary to begin making distinctions concerning |
comedy in the definition of the comic spirit itself, and with ]
the best will in the world to be original and modern, I still
must accept the observations of Aristotle and his followers
as the better definition: the comic shows men in their oll
moments as less than normally dignified and serene, and thus
indirectly criticizes their follies. If we allow 100 great an
accent upon sympathy to enter the comic, we not only blur
the outlines of comedy, but take away a primary element from
the sister-form of tragedy. Upon the general basis which sup
ports both forms —the unusual events which are sufficiently
removed from ordinary living lo be worth treating in art —
and with the understanding of civilized standards of living
which is inherent in both, it is tragedy which remains sym
pathetic because ils whole purpose and accent is individual
and subjective; comedy is primarily social and objective. 1
regret that the simplest illustration must he the time-worn
analogy of the worthy citizen falling llat with suddenness in
the street.
There we have ordinary life, universally recognizable, but
willi enough of the unusual to make a crude basis for art.
Some persons see Ihe action as unusual-and-humiliating—
these are the tragic spirits; some see it as unusual-and-incon
gruous—these are the comic spirits. The serious man thinks
of the matter in terms of himself, or of an individual who
can suffer as he himself has done; he either remembers how
much he was hurt by such a fall at one time, or sensitively
imagines how much he would he hurt by one; he admits that
such episodes are part of the common lot, and bows to the
laws of gravitation, but from his sympathetic point of view
he dreads the necessity of the admission while he makes if.
(It is this exercise of emotion struggling wtih reason which
provides the catharsis of tragedy.) The humorous man thinks
in terms of men and their ways rather distinctly of himself;
he accepts the necessary laws of life and conduct as good
things because they are, as far as anyone knows, a safe, sen-'
sible, comfortable —and inescapable- order, and he remains
amusedly aloof from those who break that order. 11 is the
reasonable social state of mind thus instinctively commenting
upon the deviations from it—really a feeling of delighted
superiority—in which the satisfaction of the comic consists.
ii
In answer to this defense of the older distinctions, there
arc innumerable arguments in favor of the sympathy of hu
mor. What of our pleasure in Tom Sawyer?—in I lie suburban
American types of Booth Tarkington?—in the better comic
strips such as Tuthill's Bungle and Fontaine Fox's Tooner
villc? What of the success of Sinclair Lewis' satiric novels?
Is not the delight we derive from these things a matter of
sympathetic recognition rather than of critical sense? I think
not. We see ourselves and our best-known neighbors in these
works, and the recognition causes pleasure, but this is only
an exaggeration of the element of familiarity necessary lo all
artistic effort; it is not the cause of laughter, of comic appre
ciation. The familiarity or recognition required for all ex
pression is, it is true, accentuated in comic material for the
very reason that it deals with the point of view of society, and
hence portrays the social order best known to the audience
whom the artist wishes lo amuse; but the true cause of the
laughter is Ihe ability to be aloof, to criticize.
This statement covers not only places and castes, but lime,
and even moods. A mature man regards familiar scenes of
American childhood with delight, beyond doubt, but even
more with the eye of an observer; and his amusement arises
largely because he is no longer the rascal or Ihe sufferer that
he was in his 'leens. The point is made especially clear by
Booth Tarkinglon's Seventeen, in which many episodes of
painfully recognizable difficulties occur; to the chief character
they are painful, and we may remember how painful analo
gous incidents in our own lives were, but in spite of that
sympathetic feeling, we laugh, because we now realize that
these things were errors, follies, or exaggerations, outside the
normal play of life in general. In like manner, we may re
member our experiences as dwellers in suburbs, in small
towns, in apartment houses, and recognize the peculiarities
and absurdities which accompany such experiences with
pleasure; but our mirth arises from the fact that we see these
familiar things from the point of view of society at its peace
ful norm, which is undisturbed by pettiness, bickering, and
ridiculous pretenses. Even though we still dwell on Main
Street in Suburbia, and recognize the episodes as matters
which surround us every day, we are removed in mood at least
lo flic attitude of a more normally sophisticated society.
Otherwise we do not enjoy the work in question at all. Proof
iu point is Ihe writing of Sinclair Lewis, the department called
Americana in the "American Mercury," the whole cllort ol the
"New Yorker" to poke fun at the provincialism of sophisti
cates theinsleves. In short, the comic spirit demands that we
look occasionally even upon ourselves as absurd specimens
deviating from Ihe serenity of the ideal standard.
Mr. Max Eastman indicates a leaning toward the belief
that Ihe comic is a matter of sympathies rather than observ
ant criticism, by adducing the example ol a baby laughing
delightedly at a watch dangled before it, or at sight ol another
baby. This is no more Ihe spirit of Ihe comic or of humor
than is the sudden laughter which often accompanies embar
rassment; it is no more related to comedy than the scream
with which nervous persons greet Ihe cry |{<)(>, can be related
lo tragedy. If is merely Ihe vocalized rellcx of 1 lie purely
physical sensation.
11 r
But if I he re has been confusion in dealing with Ihe broad
comic spirit itself, there has been confusion worse confounded
in the consideration of its cliiel expression, comedy, where er
rors somewhat resembling this one ol Mr. Eastman are com
mon. The first and most necessary distinction here is thai com
edy is not precisely the same thing as the comic spirit, though
by our smiling I can sec we think so. No definite form can be

the same thing as the spirit which animates it: the spirit is
always both broader and sharper, and the form is always
limited by the very effort to give the spirit concrete expression
—entangled by the necessity to attract and please. The author
must clothe his idea in terms which an audience may under
stand—.which means that he must deal in conventions which
he and they have agreed upon (not very consciously always);
and he must not only see that they are familiar enough, to
make his idea clear, but fresh and vivid enough to entertain.
This is the craft of art, just its the unusual-and-the-familiar
is the basic source-material of art; it is the vehicle of our
delight, but not its final cause. One might as well confuse the
idea of a journey to a given place with the automobile or the
roads which are the means of going thither. Yet students of
the comic have largely made just this confusion between the
comic spirit of a play and the laws or conventions of comedy,
the spoken play itself.
They are perhaps to justified in part by the paradox
that the conventions of comedy and tragedy (unlike the con
ventions of fiction) are decreed by the subjective or the ob
jective quality of the spirits they are representing. Tragedy,
dealing primarily with the individual and the struggles of the
spirit, is simple and stark; its situations are limited to those
in which the dignity of the chief character is enough to war
rant our sympathy; it may have little physical action—in fact
we resent the intrigue with which seventeenth century "trag
edies" were cluttered by authors all too anxious to please; and
since the familiar in tragedy is subdued below the awful,
conscious and complete verisimilitude is not necessary. Com
edy, on the other hand, requires almost the opposite of all
these elements, with the inevitable difficulty, to be faced at
once, that its social quality multiplies the number of conven
tions used, and once more creates confusion. Comedy deals
less with the individual than with a situation in which all the
characters of the play show forth the normal aspects of society
and the various ridiculous deviations from it; since it does
deal with the notions of society as the audience conceives
them, the situation may concern any groups, actions, and
places whatever, so long as the audience knows them to be
the general middle range of its own normal social existence- —
family life, for instance, is recognizable anywhere; it may
have little action, as in the comedies of wit, or—as in the
greater number of cases by far—it may depend more upon
hilarious actions than upon words alone, and in broad comedy
can serve the comic spirit well by pantomime exclusively. A
great deal of enjoyment in comedy is caused by the physical.
This contrast of tragic and comic conventions so far, may
seem to imply that the comic conventions are virtually un
limited and unchecked, but such is far from the case. As Ihc
accentuation of the social and the objective which underlies
all these conventions implies, the last general requirement of
comedy checks all the others: comedy can express its social
critical spirit only through familiar scenes and relationships,
and verisimilitude is required by the audience for ease in un
derstanding the chief point at issue. It is without doubt this
factor, so inevitable and general, added to the fact that much
of comic performance is frankly physical, that has brought
many moderns to believe that the comic and the realistic are
largely the same thing. Yet the briefest survey of comedies
shows how far from tile truth this view actually is.
iv
If realism were the foundation of the comic spirit, then
those plays adhering most closely to the actual habits peculiar
to their own day, or to the manners of a particular caste,
would he and remain the best comedies for that reason alone;
they do not. The comedies of Aristophanes, of Ben Jonson,
of the Restoration gentlemen, are good comedies in spite of
the fact that they need copious notes to explain their topical
allusions, rather than because of it. When we have become
sufficiently familiar with the life and times they represent,
when notes are no longer needed, the true use of realism in
comedy appears: the jests cause laughter through the short
hand of allusion, the play seems to run a hundred times faster,
so that the whole sparkles with entertainment, and we rush
ahead to the point of each scene and to the final purpose
of the play with a sense of breezy lightness. Hut that is all.
The physical imitation of reality which occupies so much of
comedy is useful in the same way—a lumbering walk pre
pares us for the entire character of the clumsy countryman,
who will misunderstand everything and overset whole situ
ations from his ignorance of town customs; a wink, a turn of
the hand, a resolute swing of the foot, speak volumes. In all
of this, the real is not the comic, or even all of comedy; it is
the hand-maid of these things, and to elevate it to the level
of the mistress spirit is to marry the serving maid to the
prince while the true princess is left to watch the geese and
cry upon Kalada.
The matter of speed, lo which I have just alluded brielly,
is another of the.conventions peculiar lo dramatic composi
tion, which I have reserved lo a treatment, by itsell because
!of its somewhat involved character. It is obvious that the
dramatist must feel the limitations o! time as no other artist
need (| ( ,—even O'Neill and Shaw must bend their stiff necks
lo admit the necessity of restricting their actions lo a unified
and something like reasonable space ol time, il they are to
hold the attention of an audience. The playwright's tale must
he made clear, ils action must be represented by living per
sons in action, and his comic or tragic quality must be solidPv
j established, within limitations so sharp that it we were not
| accustomed to the convention by the usage ol centuries, we
should gasp at the rigor of the demand. Many minor conven
tions assist Ihe artist in effecting his tragic or comic quality
in the brief period of presentation: he makes his choice ac
cording to the results desired, between gloomy settings, sunny
ones, or imitations of actual scenes, between poetry and prose,
between the extended line and colloquial brevity; but without,
I think, being quite aware of il himself, he depends chiefly on
his instinctive sense of rhythm to produce the correct con
junction between his subject mailer and ils rale of progress.
(It is for this reason, of course, that the best playwrights have
always been men of Ihe theatre, either actors or constant
spectators, who have become imbued with the drama by ear.)
I know not whether any critic has dealt with the two chief
, forms ol drama in terms of their rhythm of progress; I have
seen no such discussion, and it is not odd, since we have only
lately paid to the matter of rhythmic effects the attention we
should. Instead, we have discussed drama in terms of plot,
character-reaction, atmosphere, quality, and so forth, without
noticing that in some dramas of the most convincing quality
we are obviously not held by any of these things separately
or together, but by a certain something which transcends
them, and which we call lamely "tragic effect" or "comic ef
fect." There is, of course, nothing so vague in existence. Con
sider plays so familiar as Twelfth Night or Hamlet: the plots
arc ragged, attenuated, and hackneyed, and the characters are
so widely varied from magnificent to ridiculous as to preclude
any solid effect from them as a group; the poetic line has
nothing to do with the dramatic effect as a whole; yet nobody
can deny that Twelfth Night is thoroughly in the comic mood,
or that Hamlet rises above a very bloody situation to a won
derfully unified exaltation of tragic impression. To say that
we 1 eel the comic effect or tragic effect is merely to state our
own responses, not to give a name to that singular force which
keeps each play progressing in its proper tone. We are actu
ally talking about the rhythm of performance, the underlying
music ol emotional ebb and flow which is the most direct
expression of the mood in which the author has chosen to
write and affect us. Many persons prefer to call it develop
ment or suspense, but both of these terms are far too narrow.
As one might expect from the opposed natures of the
tragic and the comic, their rhythms are sharply distinguished
from each other. In tragedy the rhythm is invariably delib
erate, even slow, but inevitable—a series of forward surges
to an end which we know we must see, retarded by our inner
unwillingness to approach that end; our chief interest is the
suffering protagonist, and it is our sympathy with him, our
resentment at the situation around him, which produces this
hanging back. (If a serious play be too rapid, we know by
instinct that it is not true tragedy; and without exception it
always is melodrama.) In comedy, on the other hand, we may
know what the end is to be and we may not, but in either
case, undeterred by any concentrated sympathy, and inter
ested in the situation, or a group of individuals, rather than
in one individual, we follow with zest a rhythm of perform
ance which urges ahead in a series of eager leaps, briskly
accompanying author and actors to the point where the clown
will be kicked, the fool displayed, the hypocrite unmasked,
the shrew tamed. We hope for the end as in tragedy we dread
it, and we are content to sit through the delay of this final
critical satisfaction because the author of good comedy knows
how to make his rhythm an increasingly exciting tide of tilil
lations and checks.
I use these somewhat physical terms advisedly, for—as
the emphasis I have allowed to pantomime might suggest—
the methods of comedy arc basically an appeal to almost
physical satisfactions. It is just here that the deepest differ
ence between comedy (the form) and the comic (the spirit)
can he seen. From the shortest vaudeville turn or rough farce,
up through the most refined satire or comedy of manners, it
may be truly said that the rhythm of performance is closely
analogous to the paroxysm of a gusty sneeze. We swing for
ward with increasing sensations of coming pleasure from
the first exposition of situation: comic hint—hesitation
further hint—hesitation—development we 'can almost fore
see—hesitation (the checks becoming shorter as the situation
rushes faster) —trembling moment of ma<t uncertainty
kksou'tion & satisfaction in an explosion of stored-up laugh
ter. Uncertainly and repetition are the fundamental ingre
dients of this snuff-box. The steps in the progress may be all
different from each other in high comedy, but for the most
part in all degrees of the art, the rush to satisfaction is but
repetition of one idea delicately varied; our increasing famil
iarity with it renders the variations more amusing and the
suspense more exciting, and provides in fact part of the pleas
ure in the final resolution —we suspected it all along, and we
are half relieved and half triumphant to see it arrive.

In this eager flight to the critical point of the scene or the !
whole play, there is a muscular enjoyment of laughter so great ;
that it is no wonder the unthinking (—and Dryden!) ascribe
to it the whole delight of the comic; there is a domination of j
our milieu and its standards so pervasive that it is perhaps !
only too natural for the uncritical to assume its mere appear-1
a nee in settings, dialect, gesture, allusion, to be the essential !
comic. Moreover, there is the strong sense of experience
shared, existing among audience, actors, and unseen author,
which—even more directly than in tragic performances
gives us a sense of social existence which many persons term
sympathy. But the comic spirit resides in none of these
things, which arc really matters of comedy-method. To make !
the point clear, one has but to mention the maypole dance,
which includes all of these pleasing effects —hilarity, famil
iarity, common experience—and which is yet far from being

imy approach to the comic spirit. No; the essential comic is
the satisfaction in the critical point which is made by comedy
action, from examples such as clever Valentine overcome by
cleverer Angelica down to the kicking of the greater fool by
the lesser. It exists even at its crudest, not for action per so,
but in the words of Vanbrugh, to hold before each man
... a glass,
And show him of what species he's an ass'.
The geniality arising from a comic performance, which
makes strangers smile at each other as they leave the theatre,
may be social sympathy in a sense, but it is not the modern
sentimental sense oli tender kindness for our brother. It is
rather an admission that in tlie play we found an understand
ing of our standards and our follies, and that Puck's im
mortal comment upon mortals was a sound one. Comedy thus
leads to understanding and tolerance—but so does all art;
that is not the specific aim of the comic. The "social sym
pathy" immediately provoked by it comes from group soli
darity aroused to consciousness by critical play. Between the
animated gusto of sympathy such as that, and the tremuloufc
yearning of modern comedy-writers from the eighteenth cen
tury to the Barries (Sir .lames and Master Philip), there is
fixed a gulf of deep and all too unseen tides.
To add one more discussion lo the long list jiow extant J
concerning comedy and the comic spirit seems not so much j
a last straw as it is a waste of time; my only justification in
writing this paper is that I do not attempt a new definition of]
comedy nor add any further complexities, but that by pointing
out certain disregarded distinctions in the definitions already j
known, I hope to clarify somewhat the entanglement which
in these days prevails. The chief difficulty facing any modern

It is necessary to begin making distinctions concerning |

In answer to this defense of the older distinctions, there
arc innumerable arguments in favor of the sympathy of hu

Is not the delight we derive from these things a matter of
sympathetic recognition rather than of critical sense? I think
not. We see ourselves and our best-known neighbors in these
works, and the recognition causes pleasure, but this is only
an exaggeration of the element of familiarity necessary lo all
artistic effort; it is not the cause of laughter, of comic appre
ciation. The familiarity or recognition required for all ex
pression is, it is true, accentuated in comic material for the
very reason that it deals with the point of view of society, and
hence portrays the social order best known to the audience
whom the artist wishes lo amuse; but the true cause of the
laughter is Ihe ability to be aloof, to criticize.
This statement covers not only places and castes, but lime,
and even moods. A mature man regards familiar scenes of
American childhood with delight, beyond doubt, but even
more with the eye of an observer; and his amusement arises
largely because he is no longer the rascal or Ihe sufferer that

Booth Tarkinglon's Seventeen, in which many episodes of
painfully recognizable difficulties occur; to the chief character
they are painful, and we may remember how painful analo
gous incidents in our own lives were, but in spite of that
sympathetic feeling, we laugh, because we now realize that
these things were errors, follies, or exaggerations, outside the
normal play of life in general. In like manner, we may re
member our experiences as dwellers in suburbs, in small
towns, in apartment houses, and recognize the peculiarities
and absurdities which accompany such experiences with
pleasure; but our mirth arises from the fact that we see these
familiar things from the point of view of society at its peace
ful norm, which is undisturbed by pettiness, bickering, and
ridiculous pretenses. Even though we still dwell on Main
Street in Suburbia, and recognize the episodes as matters
which surround us every day, we are removed in mood at least
lo flic attitude of a more normally sophisticated society.
Otherwise we do not enjoy the work in question at all. Proof
iu point is Ihe writing of Sinclair Lewis, the department called
Americana in the "American Mercury," the whole cllort ol the
"New Yorker" to poke fun at the provincialism of sophisti
cates theinsleves. In short, the comic spirit demands that we
look occasionally even upon ourselves as absurd specimens
deviating from Ihe serenity of the ideal standard.
Mr. Max Eastman indicates a leaning toward the belief
that Ihe comic is a matter of sympathies rather than observ

11 r
But if I he re has been confusion in dealing with Ihe broad
comic spirit itself, there has been confusion worse confounded
in the consideration of its cliiel expression, comedy, where er
rors somewhat resembling this one ol Mr. Eastman are com
mon. The first and most necessary distinction here is thai com
edy is not precisely the same thing as the comic spirit, though
by our smiling I can sec we think so. No definite form can be

the same thing as the spirit which animates it: the spirit is
always both broader and sharper, and the form is always
limited by the very effort to give the spirit concrete expression
—entangled by the necessity to attract and please. The author
must clothe his idea in terms which an audience may under
stand—.which means that he must deal in conventions which
he and they have agreed upon (not very consciously always);
and he must not only see that they are familiar enough, to
make his idea clear, but fresh and vivid enough to entertain.
This is the craft of art, just its the unusual-and-the-familiar
is the basic source-material of art; it is the vehicle of our
delight, but not its final cause. One might as well confuse the
idea of a journey to a given place with the automobile or the
roads which are the means of going thither. Yet students of
the comic have largely made just this confusion between the
comic spirit of a play and the laws or conventions of comedy,
the spoken play itself.
They are perhaps to justified in part by the paradox
that the conventions of comedy and tragedy (unlike the con
ventions of fiction) are decreed by the subjective or the ob
jective quality of the spirits they are representing. Tragedy,
dealing primarily with the individual and the struggles of the
spirit, is simple and stark; its situations are limited to those
in which the dignity of the chief character is enough to war
rant our sympathy; it may have little physical action—in fact
we resent the intrigue with which seventeenth century "trag
edies" were cluttered by authors all too anxious to please; and
since the familiar in tragedy is subdued below the awful,
conscious and complete verisimilitude is not necessary. Com
edy, on the other hand, requires almost the opposite of all
these elements, with the inevitable difficulty, to be faced at
once, that its social quality multiplies the number of conven
tions used, and once more creates confusion. Comedy deals
less with the individual than with a situation in which all the
characters of the play show forth the normal aspects of society
and the various ridiculous deviations from it; since it does
deal with the notions of society as the audience conceives
them, the situation may concern any groups, actions, and
places whatever, so long as the audience knows them to be
the general middle range of its own normal social existence- —
family life, for instance, is recognizable anywhere; it may
have little action, as in the comedies of wit, or—as in the
greater number of cases by far—it may depend more upon
hilarious actions than upon words alone, and in broad comedy
can serve the comic spirit well by pantomime exclusively. A
great deal of enjoyment in comedy is caused by the physical.
This contrast of tragic and comic conventions so far, may
seem to imply that the comic conventions are virtually un
limited and unchecked, but such is far from the case. As Ihc
accentuation of the social and the objective which underlies
all these conventions implies, the last general requirement of
comedy checks all the others: comedy can express its social
critical spirit only through familiar scenes and relationships,
and verisimilitude is required by the audience for ease in un
derstanding the chief point at issue. It is without doubt this
factor, so inevitable and general, added to the fact that much
of comic performance is frankly physical, that has brought
many moderns to believe that the comic and the realistic are
largely the same thing. Yet the briefest survey of comedies
shows how far from tile truth this view actually is.
iv
If realism were the foundation of the comic spirit, then
those plays adhering most closely to the actual habits peculiar
to their own day, or to the manners of a particular caste,
would he and remain the best comedies for that reason alone;
they do not. The comedies of Aristophanes, of Ben Jonson,
of the Restoration gentlemen, are good comedies in spite of
the fact that they need copious notes to explain their topical
allusions, rather than because of it. When we have become
sufficiently familiar with the life and times they represent,
when notes are no longer needed, the true use of realism in
comedy appears: the jests cause laughter through the short
hand of allusion, the play seems to run a hundred times faster,
so that the whole sparkles with entertainment, and we rush
ahead to the point of each scene and to the final purpose
of the play with a sense of breezy lightness. Hut that is all.
The physical imitation of reality which occupies so much of
comedy is useful in the same way—a lumbering walk pre

cording to the results desired, between gloomy settings, sunny
ones, or imitations of actual scenes, between poetry and prose,
between the extended line and colloquial brevity; but without,
I think, being quite aware of il himself, he depends chiefly on
his instinctive sense of rhythm to produce the correct con
junction between his subject mailer and ils rale of progress.
(It is for this reason, of course, that the best playwrights have
always been men of Ihe theatre, either actors or constant
spectators, who have become imbued with the drama by ear.)
I know not whether any critic has dealt with the two chief
, forms ol drama in terms of their rhythm of progress; I have
seen no such discussion, and it is not odd, since we have only
lately paid to the matter of rhythmic effects the attention we
should. Instead, we have discussed drama in terms of plot,
character-reaction, atmosphere, quality, and so forth, without
noticing that in some dramas of the most convincing quality
we are obviously not held by any of these things separately
or together, but by a certain something which transcends
them, and which we call lamely "tragic effect" or "comic ef
fect." There is, of course, nothing so vague in existence. Con
sider plays so familiar as Twelfth Night or Hamlet: the plots
arc ragged, attenuated, and hackneyed, and the characters are
so widely varied from magnificent to ridiculous as to preclude
any solid effect from them as a group; the poetic line has
nothing to do with the dramatic effect as a whole; yet nobody
can deny that Twelfth Night is thoroughly in the comic mood,
or that Hamlet rises above a very bloody situation to a won
derfully unified exaltation of tragic impression. To say that
we 1 eel the comic effect or tragic effect is merely to state our
own responses, not to give a name to that singular force which
keeps each play progressing in its proper tone. We are actu
ally talking about the rhythm of performance, the underlying
music ol emotional ebb and flow which is the most direct
expression of the mood in which the author has chosen to
write and affect us. Many persons prefer to call it develop
ment or suspense, but both of these terms are far too narrow.
As one might expect from the opposed natures of the
tragic and the comic, their rhythms are sharply distinguished
from each other. In tragedy the rhythm is invariably delib
erate, even slow, but inevitable—a series of forward surges
to an end which we know we must see, retarded by our inner
unwillingness to approach that end; our chief interest is the
suffering protagonist, and it is our sympathy with him, our
resentment at the situation around him, which produces this
hanging back. (If a serious play be too rapid, we know by
instinct that it is not true tragedy; and without exception it
always is melodrama.) In comedy, on the other hand, we may
know what the end is to be and we may not, but in either
case, undeterred by any concentrated sympathy, and inter
ested in the situation, or a group of individuals, rather than
in one individual, we follow with zest a rhythm of perform
ance which urges ahead in a series of eager leaps, briskly
accompanying author and actors to the point where the clown
will be kicked, the fool displayed, the hypocrite unmasked,
the shrew tamed. We hope for the end as in tragedy we dread
it, and we are content to sit through the delay of this final
critical satisfaction because the author of good comedy knows
how to make his rhythm an increasingly exciting tide of tilil
lations and checks.
I use these somewhat physical terms advisedly, for—as
the emphasis I have allowed to pantomime might suggest—
the methods of comedy arc basically an appeal to almost
physical satisfactions. It is just here that the deepest differ
ence between comedy (the form) and the comic (the spirit)
can he seen. From the shortest vaudeville turn or rough farce,
up through the most refined satire or comedy of manners, it
may be truly said that the rhythm of performance is closely
analogous to the paroxysm of a gusty sneeze. We swing for
ward with increasing sensations of coming pleasure from
the first exposition of situation: comic hint—hesitation
further hint—hesitation—development we 'can almost fore
see—hesitation (the checks becoming shorter as the situation
rushes faster) —trembling moment of ma<t uncertainty
kksou'tion & satisfaction in an explosion of stored-up laugh
ter. Uncertainly and repetition are the fundamental ingre
dients of this snuff-box. The steps in the progress may be all
different from each other in high comedy, but for the most
part in all degrees of the art, the rush to satisfaction is but
repetition of one idea delicately varied; our increasing famil
iarity with it renders the variations more amusing and the
suspense more exciting, and provides in fact part of the pleas
ure in the final resolution —we suspected it all along, and we
are half relieved and half triumphant to see it arrive.

In this eager flight to the critical point of the scene or the !
whole play, there is a muscular enjoyment of laughter so great ;
that it is no wonder the unthinking (—and Dryden!) ascribe
to it the whole delight of the comic; there is a domination of j
our milieu and its standards so pervasive that it is perhaps !
only too natural for the uncritical to assume its mere appear-1
a nee in settings, dialect, gesture, allusion, to be the essential !
comic. Moreover, there is the strong sense of experience
shared, existing among audience, actors, and unseen author,
which—even more directly than in tragic performances
gives us a sense of social existence which many persons term
sympathy. But the comic spirit resides in none of these
things, which arc really matters of comedy-method. To make !
the point clear, one has but to mention the maypole dance,
which includes all of these pleasing effects —hilarity, famil
iarity, common experience—and which is yet far from being

imy approach to the comic spirit. No; the essential comic is
the satisfaction in the critical point which is made by comedy
action, from examples such as clever Valentine overcome by
cleverer Angelica down to the kicking of the greater fool by
the lesser. It exists even at its crudest, not for action per so,
but in the words of Vanbrugh, to hold before each man
... a glass,
And show him of what species he's an ass'.
The geniality arising from a comic performance, which
makes strangers smile at each other as they leave the theatre,
may be social sympathy in a sense, but it is not the modern
sentimental sense oli tender kindness for our brother. It is
rather an admission that in tlie play we found an understand
ing of our standards and our follies, and that Puck's im
mortal comment upon mortals was a sound one. Comedy thus
leads to understanding and tolerance—but so does all art;
that is not the specific aim of the comic. The "social sym
pathy" immediately provoked by it comes from group soli
darity aroused to consciousness by critical play. Between the
animated gusto of sympathy such as that, and the tremuloufc
yearning of modern comedy-writers from the eighteenth cen
tury to the Barries (Sir .lames and Master Philip), there is
fixed a gulf of deep and all too unseen tides.
To add one more discussion lo the long list jiow extant J
concerning comedy and the comic spirit seems not so much j
a last straw as it is a waste of time; my only justification in
writing this paper is that I do not attempt a new definition of]
comedy nor add any further complexities, but that by pointing
out certain disregarded distinctions in the definitions already j
known, I hope to clarify somewhat the entanglement which
in these days prevails. The chief difficulty facing any modern
who attempts to discover precisely what comedy and the
comic may be, is the vagueness which surrounds these terms
and the plays written on the basis of that vagueness. In part,
the haziness of critics and writers is the result of an amiable j
wish to regard as comic everything which is not downright j
sad; in part it springs from a tendency to sentimentalize hu
mor, after the romantic fashion begun in the eighteenth cen
tury; in part it is sheer confusion of the elements of the
comic spirit with the methods of comedy (two differing
things). In general, the fashion is to assert that the chief j
source and the aim of the comic is sympathy.
It is necessary to begin making distinctions concerning |
comedy in the definition of the comic spirit itself, and with ]
the best will in the world to be original and modern, I still
must accept the observations of Aristotle and his followers
as the better definition: the comic shows men in their oll
moments as less than normally dignified and serene, and thus
indirectly criticizes their follies. If we allow 100 great an
accent upon sympathy to enter the comic, we not only blur
the outlines of comedy, but take away a primary element from
the sister-form of tragedy. Upon the general basis which sup
ports both forms —the unusual events which are sufficiently
removed from ordinary living lo be worth treating in art —
and with the understanding of civilized standards of living
which is inherent in both, it is tragedy which remains sym
pathetic because ils whole purpose and accent is individual
and subjective; comedy is primarily social and objective. 1
regret that the simplest illustration must he the time-worn
analogy of the worthy citizen falling llat with suddenness in
the street.
There we have ordinary life, universally recognizable, but
willi enough of the unusual to make a crude basis for art.
Some persons see Ihe action as unusual-and-humiliating—
these are the tragic spirits; some see it as unusual-and-incon
gruous—these are the comic spirits. The serious man thinks
of the matter in terms of himself, or of an individual who
can suffer as he himself has done; he either remembers how
much he was hurt by such a fall at one time, or sensitively
imagines how much he would he hurt by one; he admits that
such episodes are part of the common lot, and bows to the
laws of gravitation, but from his sympathetic point of view
he dreads the necessity of the admission while he makes if.
(It is this exercise of emotion struggling wtih reason which
provides the catharsis of tragedy.) The humorous man thinks
in terms of men and their ways rather distinctly of himself;
he accepts the necessary laws of life and conduct as good
things because they are, as far as anyone knows, a safe, sen-'
sible, comfortable —and inescapable- order, and he remains
amusedly aloof from those who break that order. 11 is the
reasonable social state of mind thus instinctively commenting
upon the deviations from it—really a feeling of delighted
superiority—in which the satisfaction of the comic consists.
ii
In answer to this defense of the older distinctions, there
arc innumerable arguments in favor of the sympathy of hu
mor. What of our pleasure in Tom Sawyer?—in I lie suburban
American types of Booth Tarkington?—in the better comic
strips such as Tuthill's Bungle and Fontaine Fox's Tooner
villc? What of the success of Sinclair Lewis' satiric novels?
Is not the delight we derive from these things a matter of
sympathetic recognition rather than of critical sense? I think
not. We see ourselves and our best-known neighbors in these
works, and the recognition causes pleasure, but this is only
an exaggeration of the element of familiarity necessary lo all
artistic effort; it is not the cause of laughter, of comic appre
ciation. The familiarity or recognition required for all ex
pression is, it is true, accentuated in comic material for the
very reason that it deals with the point of view of society, and
hence portrays the social order best known to the audience
whom the artist wishes lo amuse; but the true cause of the
laughter is Ihe ability to be aloof, to criticize.
This statement covers not only places and castes, but lime,
and even moods. A mature man regards familiar scenes of
American childhood with delight, beyond doubt, but even
more with the eye of an observer; and his amusement arises
largely because he is no longer the rascal or Ihe sufferer that
he was in his 'leens. The point is made especially clear by
Booth Tarkinglon's Seventeen, in which many episodes of
painfully recognizable difficulties occur; to the chief character
they are painful, and we may remember how painful analo
gous incidents in our own lives were, but in spite of that
sympathetic feeling, we laugh, because we now realize that
these things were errors, follies, or exaggerations, outside the
normal play of life in general. In like manner, we may re
member our experiences as dwellers in suburbs, in small
towns, in apartment houses, and recognize the peculiarities
and absurdities which accompany such experiences with
pleasure; but our mirth arises from the fact that we see these
familiar things from the point of view of society at its peace
ful norm, which is undisturbed by pettiness, bickering, and
ridiculous pretenses. Even though we still dwell on Main
Street in Suburbia, and recognize the episodes as matters
which surround us every day, we are removed in mood at least
lo flic attitude of a more normally sophisticated society.
Otherwise we do not enjoy the work in question at all. Proof
iu point is Ihe writing of Sinclair Lewis, the department called
Americana in the "American Mercury," the whole cllort ol the
"New Yorker" to poke fun at the provincialism of sophisti
cates theinsleves. In short, the comic spirit demands that we
look occasionally even upon ourselves as absurd specimens
deviating from Ihe serenity of the ideal standard.
Mr. Max Eastman indicates a leaning toward the belief
that Ihe comic is a matter of sympathies rather than observ
ant criticism, by adducing the example ol a baby laughing
delightedly at a watch dangled before it, or at sight ol another
baby. This is no more Ihe spirit of Ihe comic or of humor
than is the sudden laughter which often accompanies embar
rassment; it is no more related to comedy than the scream
with which nervous persons greet Ihe cry |{<)(>, can be related
lo tragedy. If is merely Ihe vocalized rellcx of 1 lie purely
physical sensation.
11 r
But if I he re has been confusion in dealing with Ihe broad
comic spirit itself, there has been confusion worse confounded
in the consideration of its cliiel expression, comedy, where er
rors somewhat resembling this one ol Mr. Eastman are com
mon. The first and most necessary distinction here is thai com
edy is not precisely the same thing as the comic spirit, though
by our smiling I can sec we think so. No definite form can be

the same thing as the spirit which animates it: the spirit is
always both broader and sharper, and the form is always
limited by the very effort to give the spirit concrete expression
—entangled by the necessity to attract and please. The author
must clothe his idea in terms which an audience may under
stand—.which means that he must deal in conventions which
he and they have agreed upon (not very consciously always);
and he must not only see that they are familiar enough, to
make his idea clear, but fresh and vivid enough to entertain.
This is the craft of art, just its the unusual-and-the-familiar
is the basic source-material of art; it is the vehicle of our
delight, but not its final cause. One might as well confuse the
idea of a journey to a given place with the automobile or the
roads which are the means of going thither. Yet students of
the comic have largely made just this confusion between the
comic spirit of a play and the laws or conventions of comedy,
the spoken play itself.
They are perhaps to justified in part by the paradox
that the conventions of comedy and tragedy (unlike the con
ventions of fiction) are decreed by the subjective or the ob
jective quality of the spirits they are representing. Tragedy,
dealing primarily with the individual and the struggles of the
spirit, is simple and stark; its situations are limited to those
in which the dignity of the chief character is enough to war
rant our sympathy; it may have little physical action—in fact
we resent the intrigue with which seventeenth century "trag
edies" were cluttered by authors all too anxious to please; and
since the familiar in tragedy is subdued below the awful,
conscious and complete verisimilitude is not necessary. Com
edy, on the other hand, requires almost the opposite of all
these elements, with the inevitable difficulty, to be faced at
once, that its social quality multiplies the number of conven
tions used, and once more creates confusion. Comedy deals
less with the individual than with a situation in which all the
characters of the play show forth the normal aspects of society
and the various ridiculous deviations from it; since it does
deal with the notions of society as the audience conceives
them, the situation may concern any groups, actions, and
places whatever, so long as the audience knows them to be
the general middle range of its own normal social existence- —
family life, for instance, is recognizable anywhere; it may
have little action, as in the comedies of wit, or—as in the
greater number of cases by far—it may depend more upon
hilarious actions than upon words alone, and in broad comedy
can serve the comic spirit well by pantomime exclusively. A
great deal of enjoyment in comedy is caused by the physical.
This contrast of tragic and comic conventions so far, may
seem to imply that the comic conventions are virtually un
limited and unchecked, but such is far from the case. As Ihc
accentuation of the social and the objective which underlies
all these conventions implies, the last general requirement of
comedy checks all the others: comedy can express its social
critical spirit only through familiar scenes and relationships,
and verisimilitude is required by the audience for ease in un
derstanding the chief point at issue. It is without doubt this
factor, so inevitable and general, added to the fact that much
of comic performance is frankly physical, that has brought
many moderns to believe that the comic and the realistic are
largely the same thing. Yet the briefest survey of comedies
shows how far from tile truth this view actually is.
iv
If realism were the foundation of the comic spirit, then
those plays adhering most closely to the actual habits peculiar
to their own day, or to the manners of a particular caste,
would he and remain the best comedies for that reason alone;
they do not. The comedies of Aristophanes, of Ben Jonson,
of the Restoration gentlemen, are good comedies in spite of
the fact that they need copious notes to explain their topical
allusions, rather than because of it. When we have become
sufficiently familiar with the life and times they represent,
when notes are no longer needed, the true use of realism in
comedy appears: the jests cause laughter through the short
hand of allusion, the play seems to run a hundred times faster,
so that the whole sparkles with entertainment, and we rush
ahead to the point of each scene and to the final purpose
of the play with a sense of breezy lightness. Hut that is all.
The physical imitation of reality which occupies so much of
comedy is useful in the same way—a lumbering walk pre
pares us for the entire character of the clumsy countryman,
who will misunderstand everything and overset whole situ
ations from his ignorance of town customs; a wink, a turn of
the hand, a resolute swing of the foot, speak volumes. In all
of this, the real is not the comic, or even all of comedy; it is
the hand-maid of these things, and to elevate it to the level
of the mistress spirit is to marry the serving maid to the
prince while the true princess is left to watch the geese and
cry upon Kalada.
The matter of speed, lo which I have just alluded brielly,
is another of the.conventions peculiar lo dramatic composi
tion, which I have reserved lo a treatment, by itsell because
!of its somewhat involved character. It is obvious that the
dramatist must feel the limitations o! time as no other artist
need (| ( ,—even O'Neill and Shaw must bend their stiff necks
lo admit the necessity of restricting their actions lo a unified
and something like reasonable space ol time, il they are to
hold the attention of an audience. The playwright's tale must
he made clear, ils action must be represented by living per
sons in action, and his comic or tragic quality must be solidPv
j established, within limitations so sharp that it we were not
| accustomed to the convention by the usage ol centuries, we
should gasp at the rigor of the demand. Many minor conven
tions assist Ihe artist in effecting his tragic or comic quality
in the brief period of presentation: he makes his choice ac
cording to the results desired, between gloomy settings, sunny
ones, or imitations of actual scenes, between poetry and prose,
between the extended line and colloquial brevity; but without,
I think, being quite aware of il himself, he depends chiefly on
his instinctive sense of rhythm to produce the correct con
junction between his subject mailer and ils rale of progress.
(It is for this reason, of course, that the best playwrights have
always been men of Ihe theatre, either actors or constant
spectators, who have become imbued with the drama by ear.)
I know not whether any critic has dealt with the two chief
, forms ol drama in terms of their rhythm of progress; I have
seen no such discussion, and it is not odd, since we have only
lately paid to the matter of rhythmic effects the attention we

different from each other in high comedy, but for the most
part in all degrees of the art, the rush to satisfaction is but
repetition of one idea delicately varied; our increasing famil
iarity with it renders the variations more amusing and the
suspense more exciting, and provides in fact part of the pleas
ure in the final resolution —we suspected it all along, and we
are half relieved and half triumphant to see it arrive.

Is not the delight we derive from these things a matter of

not. We see ourselves and our best-known neighbors in these

very reason that it deals with the point of view of society, and
hence portrays the social order best known to the audience
whom the artist wishes lo amuse; but the true cause of the
laughter is Ihe ability to be aloof, to criticize.
This statement covers not only places and castes, but lime,
and even moods. A mature man regards familiar scenes of
American childhood with delight, beyond doubt, but even
more with the eye of an observer; and his amusement arises
largely because he is no longer the rascal or Ihe sufferer that

Booth Tarkinglon's Seventeen, in which many episodes of
painfully recognizable difficulties occur; to the chief character
they are painful, and we may remember how painful analo

pleasure; but our mirth arises from the fact that we see these
familiar things from the point of view of society at its peace
ful norm, which is undisturbed by pettiness, bickering, and
ridiculous pretenses. Even though we still dwell on Main
Street in Suburbia, and recognize the episodes as matters
which surround us every day, we are removed in mood at least
lo flic attitude of a more normally sophisticated society.
Otherwise we do not enjoy the work in question at all. Proof
iu point is Ihe writing of Sinclair Lewis, the department called
Americana in the "American Mercury," the whole cllort ol the
"New Yorker" to poke fun at the provincialism of sophisti
cates theinsleves. In short, the comic spirit demands that we
look occasionally even upon ourselves as absurd specimens
deviating from Ihe serenity of the ideal standard.
Mr. Max Eastman indicates a leaning toward the belief
that Ihe comic is a matter of sympathies rather than observ
ant criticism, by adducing the example ol a baby laughing
delightedly at a watch dangled before it, or at sight ol another
baby. This is no more Ihe spirit of Ihe comic or of humor
than is the sudden laughter which often accompanies embar
rassment; it is no more related to comedy than the scream
with which nervous persons greet Ihe cry |{<)(>, can be related
lo tragedy. If is merely Ihe vocalized rellcx of 1 lie purely
physical sensation.
11 r
But if I he re has been confusion in dealing with Ihe broad
comic spirit itself, there has been confusion worse confounded
in the consideration of its cliiel expression, comedy, where er
rors somewhat resembling this one ol Mr. Eastman are com
mon. The first and most necessary distinction here is thai com
edy is not precisely the same thing as the comic spirit, though
by our smiling I can sec we think so. No definite form can be

the same thing as the spirit which animates it: the spirit is
always both broader and sharper, and the form is always
limited by the very effort to give the spirit concrete expression
—entangled by the necessity to attract and please. The author
must clothe his idea in terms which an audience may under
stand—.which means that he must deal in conventions which
he and they have agreed upon (not very consciously always);
and he must not only see that they are familiar enough, to
make his idea clear, but fresh and vivid enough to entertain.
This is the craft of art, just its the unusual-and-the-familiar
is the basic source-material of art; it is the vehicle of our
delight, but not its final cause. One might as well confuse the
idea of a journey to a given place with the automobile or the
roads which are the means of going thither. Yet students of
the comic have largely made just this confusion between the
comic spirit of a play and the laws or conventions of comedy,
the spoken play itself.
They are perhaps to justified in part by the paradox
that the conventions of comedy and tragedy (unlike the con
ventions of fiction) are decreed by the subjective or the ob
jective quality of the spirits they are representing. Tragedy,
dealing primarily with the individual and the struggles of the
spirit, is simple and stark; its situations are limited to those
in which the dignity of the chief character is enough to war
rant our sympathy; it may have little physical action—in fact
we resent the intrigue with which seventeenth century "trag
edies" were cluttered by authors all too anxious to please; and
since the familiar in tragedy is subdued below the awful,
conscious and complete verisimilitude is not necessary. Com
edy, on the other hand, requires almost the opposite of all
these elements, with the inevitable difficulty, to be faced at
once, that its social quality multiplies the number of conven
tions used, and once more creates confusion. Comedy deals
less with the individual than with a situation in which all the
characters of the play show forth the normal aspects of society
and the various ridiculous deviations from it; since it does
deal with the notions of society as the audience conceives
them, the situation may concern any groups, actions, and
places whatever, so long as the audience knows them to be
the general middle range of its own normal social existence- —
family life, for instance, is recognizable anywhere; it may
have little action, as in the comedies of wit, or—as in the
greater number of cases by far—it may depend more upon
hilarious actions than upon words alone, and in broad comedy
can serve the comic spirit well by pantomime exclusively. A
great deal of enjoyment in comedy is caused by the physical.
This contrast of tragic and comic conventions so far, may
seem to imply that the comic conventions are virtually un
limited and unchecked, but such is far from the case. As Ihc
accentuation of the social and the objective which underlies
all these conventions implies, the last general requirement of
comedy checks all the others: comedy can express its social
critical spirit only through familiar scenes and relationships,
and verisimilitude is required by the audience for ease in un
derstanding the chief point at issue. It is without doubt this
factor, so inevitable and general, added to the fact that much
of comic performance is frankly physical, that has brought
many moderns to believe that the comic and the realistic are
largely the same thing. Yet the briefest survey of comedies
shows how far from tile truth this view actually is.
iv
If realism were the foundation of the comic spirit, then
those plays adhering most closely to the actual habits peculiar
to their own day, or to the manners of a particular caste,
would he and remain the best comedies for that reason alone;
they do not. The comedies of Aristophanes, of Ben Jonson,
of the Restoration gentlemen, are good comedies in spite of
the fact that they need copious notes to explain their topical
allusions, rather than because of it. When we have become
sufficiently familiar with the life and times they represent,
when notes are no longer needed, the true use of realism in
comedy appears: the jests cause laughter through the short
hand of allusion, the play seems to run a hundred times faster,
so that the whole sparkles with entertainment, and we rush
ahead to the point of each scene and to the final purpose
of the play with a sense of breezy lightness. Hut that is all.
The physical imitation of reality which occupies so much of
comedy is useful in the same way—a lumbering walk pre
pares us for the entire character of the clumsy countryman,
who will misunderstand everything and overset whole situ
ations from his ignorance of town customs; a wink, a turn of
the hand, a resolute swing of the foot, speak volumes. In all
of this, the real is not the comic, or even all of comedy; it is
the hand-maid of these things, and to elevate it to the level
of the mistress spirit is to marry the serving maid to the
prince while the true princess is left to watch the geese and
cry upon Kalada.
The matter of speed, lo which I have just alluded brielly,
is another of the.conventions peculiar lo dramatic composi
tion, which I have reserved lo a treatment, by itsell because
!of its somewhat involved character. It is obvious that the
dramatist must feel the limitations o! time as no other artist
need (| ( ,—even O'Neill and Shaw must bend their stiff necks
lo admit the necessity of restricting their actions lo a unified
and something like reasonable space ol time, il they are to
hold the attention of an audience. The playwright's tale must
he made clear, ils action must be represented by living per
sons in action, and his comic or tragic quality must be solidPv
j established, within limitations so sharp that it we were not
| accustomed to the convention by the usage ol centuries, we
should gasp at the rigor of the demand. Many minor conven
tions assist Ihe artist in effecting his tragic or comic quality
in the brief period of presentation: he makes his choice ac
cording to the results desired, between gloomy settings, sunny
ones, or imitations of actual scenes, between poetry and prose,
between the extended line and colloquial brevity; but without,
I think, being quite aware of il himself, he depends chiefly on
his instinctive sense of rhythm to produce the correct con
junction between his subject mailer and ils rale of progress.
(It is for this reason, of course, that the best playwrights have
always been men of Ihe theatre, either actors or constant
spectators, who have become imbued with the drama by ear.)
I know not whether any critic has dealt with the two chief
, forms ol drama in terms of their rhythm of progress; I have
seen no such discussion, and it is not odd, since we have only
lately paid to the matter of rhythmic effects the attention we
should. Instead, we have discussed drama in terms of plot,
character-reaction, atmosphere, quality, and so forth, without
noticing that in some dramas of the most convincing quality
we are obviously not held by any of these things separately
or together, but by a certain something which transcends
them, and which we call lamely "tragic effect" or "comic ef
fect." There is, of course, nothing so vague in existence. Con
sider plays so familiar as Twelfth Night or Hamlet: the plots
arc ragged, attenuated, and hackneyed, and the characters are
so widely varied from magnificent to ridiculous as to preclude
any solid effect from them as a group; the poetic line has
nothing to do with the dramatic effect as a whole; yet nobody
can deny that Twelfth Night is thoroughly in the comic mood,
or that Hamlet rises above a very bloody situation to a won
derfully unified exaltation of tragic impression. To say that
we 1 eel the comic effect or tragic effect is merely to state our
own responses, not to give a name to that singular force which
keeps each play progressing in its proper tone. We are actu
ally talking about the rhythm of performance, the underlying
music ol emotional ebb and flow which is the most direct
expression of the mood in which the author has chosen to
write and affect us. Many persons prefer to call it develop
ment or suspense, but both of these terms are far too narrow.
As one might expect from the opposed natures of the
tragic and the comic, their rhythms are sharply distinguished
from each other. In tragedy the rhythm is invariably delib
erate, even slow, but inevitable—a series of forward surges
to an end which we know we must see, retarded by our inner
unwillingness to approach that end; our chief interest is the
suffering protagonist, and it is our sympathy with him, our
resentment at the situation around him, which produces this
hanging back. (If a serious play be too rapid, we know by
instinct that it is not true tragedy; and without exception it
always is melodrama.) In comedy, on the other hand, we may
know what the end is to be and we may not, but in either
case, undeterred by any concentrated sympathy, and inter
ested in the situation, or a group of individuals, rather than
in one individual, we follow with zest a rhythm of perform
ance which urges ahead in a series of eager leaps, briskly
accompanying author and actors to the point where the clown
will be kicked, the fool displayed, the hypocrite unmasked,
the shrew tamed. We hope for the end as in tragedy we dread
it, and we are content to sit through the delay of this final
critical satisfaction because the author of good comedy knows
how to make his rhythm an increasingly exciting tide of tilil
lations and checks.
I use these somewhat physical terms advisedly, for—as
the emphasis I have allowed to pantomime might suggest—
the methods of comedy arc basically an appeal to almost
physical satisfactions. It is just here that the deepest differ
ence between comedy (the form) and the comic (the spirit)
can he seen. From the shortest vaudeville turn or rough farce,
up through the most refined satire or comedy of manners, it
may be truly said that the rhythm of performance is closely
analogous to the paroxysm of a gusty sneeze. We swing for
ward with increasing sensations of coming pleasure from
the first exposition of situation: comic hint—hesitation
further hint—hesitation—development we 'can almost fore
see—hesitation (the checks becoming shorter as the situation
rushes faster) —trembling moment of ma<t uncertainty
kksou'tion & satisfaction in an explosion of stored-up laugh
ter. Uncertainly and repetition are the fundamental ingre
dients of this snuff-box. The steps in the progress may be all
different from each other in high comedy, but for the most
part in all degrees of the art, the rush to satisfaction is but
repetition of one idea delicately varied; our increasing famil
iarity with it renders the variations more amusing and the
suspense more exciting, and provides in fact part of the pleas
ure in the final resolution —we suspected it all along, and we
are half relieved and half triumphant to see it arrive.
«
VI
In this eager flight to the critical point of the scene or the !
whole play, there is a muscular enjoyment of laughter so great ;
that it is no wonder the unthinking (—and Dryden!) ascribe
to it the whole delight of the comic; there is a domination of j
our milieu and its standards so pervasive that it is perhaps !
only too natural for the uncritical to assume its mere appear-1
a nee in settings, dialect, gesture, allusion, to be the essential !
comic. Moreover, there is the strong sense of experience
shared, existing among audience, actors, and unseen author,
which—even more directly than in tragic performances
gives us a sense of social existence which many persons term
sympathy. But the comic spirit resides in none of these
things, which arc really matters of comedy-method. To make !
the point clear, one has but to mention the maypole dance,
which includes all of these pleasing effects —hilarity, famil
iarity, common experience—and which is yet far from being

imy approach to the comic spirit. No; the essential comic is
the satisfaction in the critical point which is made by comedy
action, from examples such as clever Valentine overcome by
cleverer Angelica down to the kicking of the greater fool by
the lesser. It exists even at its crudest, not for action per so,
but in the words of Vanbrugh, to hold before each man
... a glass,
And show him of what species he's an ass'.
The geniality arising from a comic performance, which
makes strangers smile at each other as they leave the theatre,
may be social sympathy in a sense, but it is not the modern
sentimental sense oli tender kindness for our brother. It is
rather an admission that in tlie play we found an understand
ing of our standards and our follies, and that Puck's im
mortal comment upon mortals was a sound one. Comedy thus
leads to understanding and tolerance—but so does all art;
that is not the specific aim of the comic. The "social sym
pathy" immediately provoked by it comes from group soli
darity aroused to consciousness by critical play. Between the
animated gusto of sympathy such as that, and the tremuloufc
yearning of modern comedy-writers from the eighteenth cen
tury to the Barries (Sir .lames and Master Philip), there is
fixed a gulf of deep and all too unseen tides.
To add one more discussion lo the long list jiow extant J
concerning comedy and the comic spirit seems not so much j
a last straw as it is a waste of time; my only justification in
writing this paper is that I do not attempt a new definition of]
comedy nor add any further complexities, but that by pointing
out certain disregarded distinctions in the definitions already j
known, I hope to clarify somewhat the entanglement which
in these days prevails. The chief difficulty facing any modern
who attempts to discover precisely what comedy and the
comic may be, is the vagueness which surrounds these terms
and the plays written on the basis of that vagueness. In part,
the haziness of critics and writers is the result of an amiable j
wish to regard as comic everything which is not downright j
sad; in part it springs from a tendency to sentimentalize hu
mor, after the romantic fashion begun in the eighteenth cen
tury; in part it is sheer confusion of the elements of the
comic spirit with the methods of comedy (two differing
things). In general, the fashion is to assert that the chief j
source and the aim of the comic is sympathy.
It is necessary to begin making distinctions concerning |
comedy in the definition of the comic spirit itself, and with ]
the best will in the world to be original and modern, I still
must accept the observations of Aristotle and his followers
as the better definition: the comic shows men in their oll
moments as less than normally dignified and serene, and thus
indirectly criticizes their follies. If we allow 100 great an
accent upon sympathy to enter the comic, we not only blur
the outlines of comedy, but take away a primary element from
the sister-form of tragedy. Upon the general basis which sup
ports both forms —the unusual events which are sufficiently
removed from ordinary living lo be worth treating in art —
and with the understanding of civilized standards of living
which is inherent in both, it is tragedy which remains sym
pathetic because ils whole purpose and accent is individual
and subjective; comedy is primarily social and objective. 1
regret that the simplest illustration must he the time-worn
analogy of the worthy citizen falling llat with suddenness in
the street.
There we have ordinary life, universally recognizable, but
willi enough of the unusual to make a crude basis for art.
Some persons see Ihe action as unusual-and-humiliating—
these are the tragic spirits; some see it as unusual-and-incon
gruous—these are the comic spirits. The serious man thinks
of the matter in terms of himself, or of an individual who
can suffer as he himself has done; he either remembers how
much he was hurt by such a fall at one time, or sensitively
imagines how much he would he hurt by one; he admits that
such episodes are part of the common lot, and bows to the
laws of gravitation, but from his sympathetic point of view
he dreads the necessity of the admission while he makes if.
(It is this exercise of emotion struggling wtih reason which
provides the catharsis of tragedy.) The humorous man thinks
in terms of men and their ways rather distinctly of himself;
he accepts the necessary laws of life and conduct as good
things because they are, as far as anyone knows, a safe, sen-'
sible, comfortable —and inescapable- order, and he remains
amusedly aloof from those who break that order. 11 is the
reasonable social state of mind thus instinctively commenting
upon the deviations from it—really a feeling of delighted
superiority—in which the satisfaction of the comic consists.
ii
In answer to this defense of the older distinctions, there
arc innumerable arguments in favor of the sympathy of hu
mor. What of our pleasure in Tom Sawyer?—in I lie suburban
American types of Booth Tarkington?—in the better comic
strips such as Tuthill's Bungle and Fontaine Fox's Tooner
villc? What of the success of Sinclair Lewis' satiric novels?
Is not the delight we derive from these things a matter of
sympathetic recognition rather than of critical sense? I think
not. We see ourselves and our best-known neighbors in these
works, and the recognition causes pleasure, but this is only
an exaggeration of the element of familiarity necessary lo all
artistic effort; it is not the cause of laughter, of comic appre
ciation. The familiarity or recognition required for all ex
pression is, it is true, accentuated in comic material for the
very reason that it deals with the point of view of society, and
hence portrays the social order best known to the audience
whom the artist wishes lo amuse; but the true cause of the
laughter is Ihe ability to be aloof, to criticize.
This statement covers not only places and castes, but lime,
and even moods. A mature man regards familiar scenes of
American childhood with delight, beyond doubt, but even
more with the eye of an observer; and his amusement arises
largely because he is no longer the rascal or Ihe sufferer that
he was in his 'leens. The point is made especially clear by
Booth Tarkinglon's Seventeen, in which many episodes of
painfully recognizable difficulties occur; to the chief character
they are painful, and we may remember how painful analo
gous incidents in our own lives were, but in spite of that
sympathetic feeling, we laugh, because we now realize that
these things were errors, follies, or exaggerations, outside the
normal play of life in general. In like manner, we may re
member our experiences as dwellers in suburbs, in small
towns, in apartment houses, and recognize the peculiarities
and absurdities which accompany such experiences with
pleasure; but our mirth arises from the fact that we see these
familiar things from the point of view of society at its peace
ful norm, which is undisturbed by pettiness, bickering, and
ridiculous pretenses. Even though we still dwell on Main
Street in Suburbia, and recognize the episodes as matters
which surround us every day, we are removed in mood at least
lo flic attitude of a more normally sophisticated society.
Otherwise we do not enjoy the work in question at all. Proof
iu point is Ihe writing of Sinclair Lewis, the department called
Americana in the "American Mercury," the whole cllort ol the
"New Yorker" to poke fun at the provincialism of sophisti
cates theinsleves. In short, the comic spirit demands that we
look occasionally even upon ourselves as absurd specimens
deviating from Ihe serenity of the ideal standard.
Mr. Max Eastman indicates a leaning toward the belief
that Ihe comic is a matter of sympathies rather than observ
ant criticism, by adducing the example ol a baby laughing
delightedly at a watch dangled before it, or at sight ol another
baby. This is no more Ihe spirit of Ihe comic or of humor
than is the sudden laughter which often accompanies embar
rassment; it is no more related to comedy than the scream
with which nervous persons greet Ihe cry |{<)(>, can be related
lo tragedy. If is merely Ihe vocalized rellcx of 1 lie purely
physical sensation.
11 r
But if I he re has been confusion in dealing with Ihe broad
comic spirit itself, there has been confusion worse confounded
in the consideration of its cliiel expression, comedy, where er
rors somewhat resembling this one ol Mr. Eastman are com
mon. The first and most necessary distinction here is thai com
edy is not precisely the same thing as the comic spirit, though
by our smiling I can sec we think so. No definite form can be

the same thing as the spirit which animates it: the spirit is
always both broader and sharper, and the form is always
limited by the very effort to give the spirit concrete expression
—entangled by the necessity to attract and please. The author
must clothe his idea in terms which an audience may under
stand—.which means that he must deal in conventions which
he and they have agreed upon (not very consciously always);
and he must not only see that they are familiar enough, to
make his idea clear, but fresh and vivid enough to entertain.
This is the craft of art, just its the unusual-and-the-familiar
is the basic source-material of art; it is the vehicle of our
delight, but not its final cause. One might as well confuse the
idea of a journey to a given place with the automobile or the
roads which are the means of going thither. Yet students of
the comic have largely made just this confusion between the
comic spirit of a play and the laws or conventions of comedy,
the spoken play itself.
They are perhaps to justified in part by the paradox
that the conventions of comedy and tragedy (unlike the con
ventions of fiction) are decreed by the subjective or the ob
jective quality of the spirits they are representing. Tragedy,
dealing primarily with the individual and the struggles of the
spirit, is simple and stark; its situations are limited to those
in which the dignity of the chief character is enough to war
rant our sympathy; it may have little physical action—in fact
we resent the intrigue with which seventeenth century "trag
edies" were cluttered by authors all too anxious to please; and
since the familiar in tragedy is subdued below the awful,
conscious and complete verisimilitude is not necessary. Com
edy, on the other hand, requires almost the opposite of all
these elements, with the inevitable difficulty, to be faced at
once, that its social quality multiplies the number of conven
tions used, and once more creates confusion. Comedy deals
less with the individual than with a situation in which all the
characters of the play show forth the normal aspects of society
and the various ridiculous deviations from it; since it does
deal with the notions of society as the audience conceives
them, the situation may concern any groups, actions, and
places whatever, so long as the audience knows them to be
the general middle range of its own normal social existence- —
family life, for instance, is recognizable anywhere; it may
have little action, as in the comedies of wit, or—as in the
greater number of cases by far—it may depend more upon
hilarious actions than upon words alone, and in broad comedy
can serve the comic spirit well by pantomime exclusively. A
great deal of enjoyment in comedy is caused by the physical.
This contrast of tragic and comic conventions so far, may
seem to imply that the comic conventions are virtually un
limited and unchecked, but such is far from the case. As Ihc
accentuation of the social and the objective which underlies
all these conventions implies, the last general requirement of
comedy checks all the others: comedy can express its social
critical spirit only through familiar scenes and relationships,
and verisimilitude is required by the audience for ease in un
derstanding the chief point at issue. It is without doubt this
factor, so inevitable and general, added to the fact that much
of comic performance is frankly physical, that has brought
many moderns to believe that the comic and the realistic are
largely the same thing. Yet the briefest survey of comedies
shows how far from tile truth this view actually is.
iv
If realism were the foundation of the comic spirit, then
those plays adhering most closely to the actual habits peculiar
to their own day, or to the manners of a particular caste,
would he and remain the best comedies for that reason alone;
they do not. The comedies of Aristophanes, of Ben Jonson,
of the Restoration gentlemen, are good comedies in spite of
the fact that they need copious notes to explain their topical
allusions, rather than because of it. When we have become
sufficiently familiar with the life and times they represent,
when notes are no longer needed, the true use of realism in

so that the whole sparkles with entertainment, and we rush

the satisfaction in the critical point which is made by comedy
action, from examples such as clever Valentine overcome by
cleverer Angelica down to the kicking of the greater fool by
the lesser. It exists even at its crudest, not for action per so,
but in the words of Vanbrugh, to hold before each man
... a glass,
And show him of what species he's an ass'.
The geniality arising from a comic performance, which
makes strangers smile at each other as they leave the theatre,
may be social sympathy in a sense, but it is not the modern
sentimental sense oli tender kindness for our brother. It is
rather an admission that in tlie play we found an understand
ing of our standards and our follies, and that Puck's im
mortal comment upon mortals was a sound one. Comedy thus
leads to understanding and tolerance—but so does all art;
that is not the specific aim of the comic. The "social sym
pathy" immediately provoked by it comes from group soli
darity aroused to consciousness by critical play. Between the
animated gusto of sympathy such as that, and the tremuloufc
yearning of modern comedy-writers from the eighteenth cen
tury to the Barries (Sir .lames and Master Philip), there is
fixed a gulf of deep and all too unseen tides.
To add one more discussion lo the long list jiow extant J
concerning comedy and the comic spirit seems not so much j
a last straw as it is a waste of time; my only justification in
writing this paper is that I do not attempt a new definition of]
comedy nor add any further complexities, but that by pointing
out certain disregarded distinctions in the definitions already j
known, I hope to clarify somewhat the entanglement which
in these days prevails. The chief difficulty facing any modern
who attempts to discover precisely what comedy and the
comic may be, is the vagueness which surrounds these terms
and the plays written on the basis of that vagueness. In part,
the haziness of critics and writers is the result of an amiable j
wish to regard as comic everything which is not downright j
sad; in part it springs from a tendency to sentimentalize hu
mor, after the romantic fashion begun in the eighteenth cen
tury; in part it is sheer confusion of the elements of the
comic spirit with the methods of comedy (two differing
things). In general, the fashion is to assert that the chief j
source and the aim of the comic is sympathy.
It is necessary to begin making distinctions concerning |
comedy in the definition of the comic spirit itself, and with ]
the best will in the world to be original and modern, I still
must accept the observations of Aristotle and his followers
as the better definition: the comic shows men in their oll
moments as less than normally dignified and serene, and thus
indirectly criticizes their follies. If we allow 100 great an
accent upon sympathy to enter the comic, we not only blur
the outlines of comedy, but take away a primary element from
the sister-form of tragedy. Upon the general basis which sup
ports both forms —the unusual events which are sufficiently
removed from ordinary living lo be worth treating in art —
and with the understanding of civilized standards of living
which is inherent in both, it is tragedy which remains sym
pathetic because ils whole purpose and accent is individual
and subjective; comedy is primarily social and objective. 1
regret that the simplest illustration must he the time-worn
analogy of the worthy citizen falling llat with suddenness in
the street.
There we have ordinary life, universally recognizable, but
willi enough of the unusual to make a crude basis for art.
Some persons see Ihe action as unusual-and-humiliating—
these are the tragic spirits; some see it as unusual-and-incon
gruous—these are the comic spirits. The serious man thinks
of the matter in terms of himself, or of an individual who
can suffer as he himself has done; he either remembers how
much he was hurt by such a fall at one time, or sensitively
imagines how much he would he hurt by one; he admits that
such episodes are part of the common lot, and bows to the
laws of gravitation, but from his sympathetic point of view
he dreads the necessity of the admission while he makes if.
(It is this exercise of emotion struggling wtih reason which
provides the catharsis of tragedy.) The humorous man thinks
in terms of men and their ways rather distinctly of himself;
he accepts the necessary laws of life and conduct as good
things because they are, as far as anyone knows, a safe, sen-'
sible, comfortable —and inescapable- order, and he remains
amusedly aloof from those who break that order. 11 is the
reasonable social state of mind thus instinctively commenting
upon the deviations from it—really a feeling of delighted
superiority—in which the satisfaction of the comic consists.
ii
In answer to this defense of the older distinctions, there
arc innumerable arguments in favor of the sympathy of hu
mor. What of our pleasure in Tom Sawyer?—in I lie suburban
American types of Booth Tarkington?—in the better comic
strips such as Tuthill's Bungle and Fontaine Fox's Tooner
villc? What of the success of Sinclair Lewis' satiric novels?
Is not the delight we derive from these things a matter of
sympathetic recognition rather than of critical sense? I think
not. We see ourselves and our best-known neighbors in these
works, and the recognition causes pleasure, but this is only
an exaggeration of the element of familiarity necessary lo all
artistic effort; it is not the cause of laughter, of comic appre
ciation. The familiarity or recognition required for all ex
pression is, it is true, accentuated in comic material for the
very reason that it deals with the point of view of society, and
hence portrays the social order best known to the audience
whom the artist wishes lo amuse; but the true cause of the
laughter is Ihe ability to be aloof, to criticize.
This statement covers not only places and castes, but lime,
and even moods. A mature man regards familiar scenes of
American childhood with delight, beyond doubt, but even
more with the eye of an observer; and his amusement arises
largely because he is no longer the rascal or Ihe sufferer that
he was in his 'leens. The point is made especially clear by
Booth Tarkinglon's Seventeen, in which many episodes of
painfully recognizable difficulties occur; to the chief character
they are painful, and we may remember how painful analo
gous incidents in our own lives were, but in spite of that
sympathetic feeling, we laugh, because we now realize that
these things were errors, follies, or exaggerations, outside the
normal play of life in general. In like manner, we may re
member our experiences as dwellers in suburbs, in small
towns, in apartment houses, and recognize the peculiarities
and absurdities which accompany such experiences with
pleasure; but our mirth arises from the fact that we see these
familiar things from the point of view of society at its peace
ful norm, which is undisturbed by pettiness, bickering, and
ridiculous pretenses. Even though we still dwell on Main
Street in Suburbia, and recognize the episodes as matters
which surround us every day, we are removed in mood at least
lo flic attitude of a more normally sophisticated society.
Otherwise we do not enjoy the work in question at all. Proof
iu point is Ihe writing of Sinclair Lewis, the department called
Americana in the "American Mercury," the whole cllort ol the
"New Yorker" to poke fun at the provincialism of sophisti
cates theinsleves. In short, the comic spirit demands that we
look occasionally even upon ourselves as absurd specimens
deviating from Ihe serenity of the ideal standard.
Mr. Max Eastman indicates a leaning toward the belief
that Ihe comic is a matter of sympathies rather than observ
ant criticism, by adducing the example ol a baby laughing
delightedly at a watch dangled before it, or at sight ol another
baby. This is no more Ihe spirit of Ihe comic or of humor
than is the sudden laughter which often accompanies embar
rassment; it is no more related to comedy than the scream
with which nervous persons greet Ihe cry |{<)(>, can be related
lo tragedy. If is merely Ihe vocalized rellcx of 1 lie purely
physical sensation.
11 r
But if I he re has been confusion in dealing with Ihe broad
comic spirit itself, there has been confusion worse confounded
in the consideration of its cliiel expression, comedy, where er
rors somewhat resembling this one ol Mr. Eastman are com
mon. The first and most necessary distinction here is thai com
edy is not precisely the same thing as the comic spirit, though
by our smiling I can sec we think so. No definite form can be

the same thing as the spirit which animates it: the spirit is
always both broader and sharper, and the form is always
limited by the very effort to give the spirit concrete expression
—entangled by the necessity to attract and please. The author
must clothe his idea in terms which an audience may under
stand—.which means that he must deal in conventions which
he and they have agreed upon (not very consciously always);
and he must not only see that they are familiar enough, to
make his idea clear, but fresh and vivid enough to entertain.
This is the craft of art, just its the unusual-and-the-familiar
is the basic source-material of art; it is the vehicle of our
delight, but not its final cause. One might as well confuse the
idea of a journey to a given place with the automobile or the
roads which are the means of going thither. Yet students of
the comic have largely made just this confusion between the
comic spirit of a play and the laws or conventions of comedy,
the spoken play itself.
They are perhaps to justified in part by the paradox
that the conventions of comedy and tragedy (unlike the con
ventions of fiction) are decreed by the subjective or the ob
jective quality of the spirits they are representing. Tragedy,
dealing primarily with the individual and the struggles of the
spirit, is simple and stark; its situations are limited to those
in which the dignity of the chief character is enough to war
rant our sympathy; it may have little physical action—in fact
we resent the intrigue with which seventeenth century "trag
edies" were cluttered by authors all too anxious to please; and
since the familiar in tragedy is subdued below the awful,
conscious and complete verisimilitude is not necessary. Com
edy, on the other hand, requires almost the opposite of all
these elements, with the inevitable difficulty, to be faced at
once, that its social quality multiplies the number of conven
tions used, and once more creates confusion. Comedy deals
less with the individual than with a situation in which all the
characters of the play show forth the normal aspects of society
and the various ridiculous deviations from it; since it does
deal with the notions of society as the audience conceives
them, the situation may concern any groups, actions, and
places whatever, so long as the audience knows them to be
the general middle range of its own normal social existence- —
family life, for instance, is recognizable anywhere; it may
have little action, as in the comedies of wit, or—as in the
greater number of cases by far—it may depend more upon
hilarious actions than upon words alone, and in broad comedy
can serve the comic spirit well by pantomime exclusively. A
great deal of enjoyment in comedy is caused by the physical.
This contrast of tragic and comic conventions so far, may
seem to imply that the comic conventions are virtually un
limited and unchecked, but such is far from the case. As Ihc
accentuation of the social and the objective which underlies
all these conventions implies, the last general requirement of
comedy checks all the others: comedy can express its social
critical spirit only through familiar scenes and relationships,
and verisimilitude is required by the audience for ease in un
derstanding the chief point at issue. It is without doubt this
factor, so inevitable and general, added to the fact that much
of comic performance is frankly physical, that has brought
many moderns to believe that the comic and the realistic are
largely the same thing. Yet the briefest survey of comedies
shows how far from tile truth this view actually is.
iv
If realism were the foundation of the comic spirit, then
those plays adhering most closely to the actual habits peculiar
to their own day, or to the manners of a particular caste,
would he and remain the best comedies for that reason alone;
they do not. The comedies of Aristophanes, of Ben Jonson,
of the Restoration gentlemen, are good comedies in spite of
the fact that they need copious notes to explain their topical
allusions, rather than because of it. When we have become
sufficiently familiar with the life and times they represent,
when notes are no longer needed, the true use of realism in
comedy appears: the jests cause laughter through the short
hand of allusion, the play seems to run a hundred times faster,
so that the whole sparkles with entertainment, and we rush
ahead to the point of each scene and to the final purpose
of the play with a sense of breezy lightness. Hut that is all.
The physical imitation of reality which occupies so much of
comedy is useful in the same way—a lumbering walk pre
pares us for the entire character of the clumsy countryman,
who will misunderstand everything and overset whole situ
ations from his ignorance of town customs; a wink, a turn of
the hand, a resolute swing of the foot, speak volumes. In all
of this, the real is not the comic, or even all of comedy; it is
the hand-maid of these things, and to elevate it to the level
of the mistress spirit is to marry the serving maid to the
prince while the true princess is left to watch the geese and
cry upon Kalada.
The matter of speed, lo which I have just alluded brielly,
is another of the.conventions peculiar lo dramatic composi
tion, which I have reserved lo a treatment, by itsell because
!of its somewhat involved character. It is obvious that the
dramatist must feel the limitations o! time as no other artist
need (| ( ,—even O'Neill and Shaw must bend their stiff necks
lo admit the necessity of restricting their actions lo a unified
and something like reasonable space ol time, il they are to
hold the attention of an audience. The playwright's tale must
he made clear, ils action must be represented by living per
sons in action, and his comic or tragic quality must be solidPv
j established, within limitations so sharp that it we were not
| accustomed to the convention by the usage ol centuries, we
should gasp at the rigor of the demand. Many minor conven
tions assist Ihe artist in effecting his tragic or comic quality
in the brief period of presentation: he makes his choice ac
cording to the results desired, between gloomy settings, sunny
ones, or imitations of actual scenes, between poetry and prose,
between the extended line and colloquial brevity; but without,
I think, being quite aware of il himself, he depends chiefly on
his instinctive sense of rhythm to produce the correct con
junction between his subject mailer and ils rale of progress.
(It is for this reason, of course, that the best playwrights have
always been men of Ihe theatre, either actors or constant
spectators, who have become imbued with the drama by ear.)
I know not whether any critic has dealt with the two chief
, forms ol drama in terms of their rhythm of progress; I have
seen no such discussion, and it is not odd, since we have only
lately paid to the matter of rhythmic effects the attention we
should. Instead, we have discussed drama in terms of plot,
character-reaction, atmosphere, quality, and so forth, without
noticing that in some dramas of the most convincing quality
we are obviously not held by any of these things separately
or together, but by a certain something which transcends
them, and which we call lamely "tragic effect" or "comic ef
fect." There is, of course, nothing so vague in existence. Con
sider plays so familiar as Twelfth Night or Hamlet: the plots
arc ragged, attenuated, and hackneyed, and the characters are
so widely varied from magnificent to ridiculous as to preclude
any solid effect from them as a group; the poetic line has
nothing to do with the dramatic effect as a whole; yet nobody
can deny that Twelfth Night is thoroughly in the comic mood,
or that Hamlet rises above a very bloody situation to a won
derfully unified exaltation of tragic impression. To say that
we 1 eel the comic effect or tragic effect is merely to state our
own responses, not to give a name to that singular force which
keeps each play progressing in its proper tone. We are actu
ally talking about the rhythm of performance, the underlying
music ol emotional ebb and flow which is the most direct
expression of the mood in which the author has chosen to
write and affect us. Many persons prefer to call it develop
ment or suspense, but both of these terms are far too narrow.
As one might expect from the opposed natures of the
tragic and the comic, their rhythms are sharply distinguished
from each other. In tragedy the rhythm is invariably delib
erate, even slow, but inevitable—a series of forward surges
to an end which we know we must see, retarded by our inner
unwillingness to approach that end; our chief interest is the
suffering protagonist, and it is our sympathy with him, our
resentment at the situation around him, which produces this
hanging back. (If a serious play be too rapid, we know by
instinct that it is not true tragedy; and without exception it
always is melodrama.) In comedy, on the other hand, we may
know what the end is to be and we may not, but in either
case, undeterred by any concentrated sympathy, and inter
ested in the situation, or a group of individuals, rather than
in one individual, we follow with zest a rhythm of perform
ance which urges ahead in a series of eager leaps, briskly
accompanying author and actors to the point where the clown
will be kicked, the fool displayed, the hypocrite unmasked,
the shrew tamed. We hope for the end as in tragedy we dread
it, and we are content to sit through the delay of this final
critical satisfaction because the author of good comedy knows
how to make his rhythm an increasingly exciting tide of tilil
lations and checks.
I use these somewhat physical terms advisedly, for—as
the emphasis I have allowed to pantomime might suggest—
the methods of comedy arc basically an appeal to almost
physical satisfactions. It is just here that the deepest differ
ence between comedy (the form) and the comic (the spirit)
can he seen. From the shortest vaudeville turn or rough farce,
up through the most refined satire or comedy of manners, it
may be truly said that the rhythm of performance is closely
analogous to the paroxysm of a gusty sneeze. We swing for
ward with increasing sensations of coming pleasure from
the first exposition of situation: comic hint—hesitation
further hint—hesitation—development we 'can almost fore
see—hesitation (the checks becoming shorter as the situation
rushes faster) —trembling moment of ma<t uncertainty
kksou'tion & satisfaction in an explosion of stored-up laugh
ter. Uncertainly and repetition are the fundamental ingre
dients of this snuff-box. The steps in the progress may be all
different from each other in high comedy, but for the most
part in all degrees of the art, the rush to satisfaction is but
repetition of one idea delicately varied; our increasing famil
iarity with it renders the variations more amusing and the
suspense more exciting, and provides in fact part of the pleas
ure in the final resolution —we suspected it all along, and we
are half relieved and half triumphant to see it arrive.

VI
In this eager flight to the critical point of the scene or the !
whole play, there is a muscular enjoyment of laughter so great ;
that it is no wonder the unthinking (—and Dryden!) ascribe
to it the whole delight of the comic; there is a domination of j
our milieu and its standards so pervasive that it is perhaps !
only too natural for the uncritical to assume its mere appear-1
a nee in settings, dialect, gesture, allusion, to be the essential !
comic. Moreover, there is the strong sense of experience
shared, existing among audience, actors, and unseen author,
which—even more directly than in tragic performances
gives us a sense of social existence which many persons term
sympathy. But the comic spirit resides in none of these
things, which arc really matters of comedy-method. To make !
the point clear, one has but to mention the maypole dance,
which includes all of these pleasing effects —hilarity, famil
iarity, common experience—and which is yet far from being

imy approach to the comic spirit. No; the essential comic is
the satisfaction in the critical point which is made by comedy
action, from examples such as clever Valentine overcome by
cleverer Angelica down to the kicking of the greater fool by
the lesser. It exists even at its crudest, not for action per so,
but in the words of Vanbrugh, to hold before each man
... a glass,
And show him of what species he's an ass'.
The geniality arising from a comic performance, which
makes strangers smile at each other as they leave the theatre,
may be social sympathy in a sense, but it is not the modern
sentimental sense oli tender kindness for our brother. It is
rather an admission that in tlie play we found an understand

mortal comment upon mortals was a sound one. Comedy thus
leads to understanding and tolerance—but so does all art;
that is not the specific aim of the comic. The "social sym

darity aroused to consciousness by critical play. Between the
animated gusto of sympathy such as that, and the tremuloufc
yearning of modern comedy-writers from the eighteenth cen

fixed a gulf of deep and all too unseen tides.
To add one more discussion lo the long list jiow extant J

Is not the delight we derive from these things a matter of

not. We see ourselves and our best-known neighbors in these
works, and the recognition causes pleasure, but this is only
an exaggeration of the element of familiarity necessary lo all

and absurdities which accompany such experiences with
pleasure; but our mirth arises from the fact that we see these
familiar things from the point of view of society at its peace
ful norm, which is undisturbed by pettiness, bickering, and
ridiculous pretenses. Even though we still dwell on Main
Street in Suburbia, and recognize the episodes as matters
which surround us every day, we are removed in mood at least
lo flic attitude of a more normally sophisticated society.
Otherwise we do not enjoy the work in question at all. Proof
iu point is Ihe writing of Sinclair Lewis, the department called
Americana in the "American Mercury," the whole cllort ol the

11 r
But if I he re has been confusion in dealing with Ihe broad
comic spirit itself, there has been confusion worse confounded
in the consideration of its cliiel expression, comedy, where er
rors somewhat resembling this one ol Mr. Eastman are com
mon. The first and most necessary distinction here is thai com
edy is not precisely the same thing as the comic spirit, though
by our smiling I can sec we think so. No definite form can be

the same thing as the spirit which animates it: the spirit is
always both broader and sharper, and the form is always
limited by the very effort to give the spirit concrete expression
—entangled by the necessity to attract and please. The author
must clothe his idea in terms which an audience may under
stand—.which means that he must deal in conventions which
he and they have agreed upon (not very consciously always);
and he must not only see that they are familiar enough, to
make his idea clear, but fresh and vivid enough to entertain.
This is the craft of art, just its the unusual-and-the-familiar
is the basic source-material of art; it is the vehicle of our
delight, but not its final cause. One might as well confuse the
idea of a journey to a given place with the automobile or the
roads which are the means of going thither. Yet students of
the comic have largely made just this confusion between the
comic spirit of a play and the laws or conventions of comedy,
the spoken play itself.
They are perhaps to justified in part by the paradox
that the conventions of comedy and tragedy (unlike the con
ventions of fiction) are decreed by the subjective or the ob
jective quality of the spirits they are representing. Tragedy,
dealing primarily with the individual and the struggles of the
spirit, is simple and stark; its situations are limited to those
in which the dignity of the chief character is enough to war
rant our sympathy; it may have little physical action—in fact
we resent the intrigue with which seventeenth century "trag
edies" were cluttered by authors all too anxious to please; and
since the familiar in tragedy is subdued below the awful,
conscious and complete verisimilitude is not necessary. Com
edy, on the other hand, requires almost the opposite of all
these elements, with the inevitable difficulty, to be faced at
once, that its social quality multiplies the number of conven
tions used, and once more creates confusion. Comedy deals
less with the individual than with a situation in which all the
characters of the play show forth the normal aspects of society
and the various ridiculous deviations from it; since it does
deal with the notions of society as the audience conceives
them, the situation may concern any groups, actions, and
places whatever, so long as the audience knows them to be
the general middle range of its own normal social existence- —
family life, for instance, is recognizable anywhere; it may
have little action, as in the comedies of wit, or—as in the
greater number of cases by far—it may depend more upon
hilarious actions than upon words alone, and in broad comedy
can serve the comic spirit well by pantomime exclusively. A
great deal of enjoyment in comedy is caused by the physical.
This contrast of tragic and comic conventions so far, may
seem to imply that the comic conventions are virtually un
limited and unchecked, but such is far from the case. As Ihc
accentuation of the social and the objective which underlies
all these conventions implies, the last general requirement of
comedy checks all the others: comedy can express its social
critical spirit only through familiar scenes and relationships,
and verisimilitude is required by the audience for ease in un
derstanding the chief point at issue. It is without doubt this
factor, so inevitable and general, added to the fact that much
of comic performance is frankly physical, that has brought
many moderns to believe that the comic and the realistic are
largely the same thing. Yet the briefest survey of comedies
shows how far from tile truth this view actually is.
iv
If realism were the foundation of the comic spirit, then
those plays adhering most closely to the actual habits peculiar
to their own day, or to the manners of a particular caste,
would he and remain the best comedies for that reason alone;
they do not. The comedies of Aristophanes, of Ben Jonson,
of the Restoration gentlemen, are good comedies in spite of
the fact that they need copious notes to explain their topical
allusions, rather than because of it. When we have become
sufficiently familiar with the life and times they represent,
when notes are no longer needed, the true use of realism in
comedy appears: the jests cause laughter through the short
hand of allusion, the play seems to run a hundred times faster,
so that the whole sparkles with entertainment, and we rush
ahead to the point of each scene and to the final purpose
of the play with a sense of breezy lightness. Hut that is all.
The physical imitation of reality which occupies so much of
comedy is useful in the same way—a lumbering walk pre
pares us for the entire character of the clumsy countryman,
who will misunderstand everything and overset whole situ
ations from his ignorance of town customs; a wink, a turn of
the hand, a resolute swing of the foot, speak volumes. In all
of this, the real is not the comic, or even all of comedy; it is
the hand-maid of these things, and to elevate it to the level
of the mistress spirit is to marry the serving maid to the
prince while the true princess is left to watch the geese and
cry upon Kalada.
The matter of speed, lo which I have just alluded brielly,
is another of the.conventions peculiar lo dramatic composi
tion, which I have reserved lo a treatment, by itsell because
!of its somewhat involved character. It is obvious that the
dramatist must feel the limitations o! time as no other artist
need (| ( ,—even O'Neill and Shaw must bend their stiff necks
lo admit the necessity of restricting their actions lo a unified
and something like reasonable space ol time, il they are to
hold the attention of an audience. The playwright's tale must
he made clear, ils action must be represented by living per
sons in action, and his comic or tragic quality must be solidPv
j established, within limitations so sharp that it we were not
| accustomed to the convention by the usage ol centuries, we
should gasp at the rigor of the demand. Many minor conven
tions assist Ihe artist in effecting his tragic or comic quality
in the brief period of presentation: he makes his choice ac
cording to the results desired, between gloomy settings, sunny
ones, or imitations of actual scenes, between poetry and prose,
between the extended line and colloquial brevity; but without,
I think, being quite aware of il himself, he depends chiefly on
his instinctive sense of rhythm to produce the correct con
junction between his subject mailer and ils rale of progress.
(It is for this reason, of course, that the best playwrights have
always been men of Ihe theatre, either actors or constant
spectators, who have become imbued with the drama by ear.)
I know not whether any critic has dealt with the two chief
, forms ol drama in terms of their rhythm of progress; I have
seen no such discussion, and it is not odd, since we have only
lately paid to the matter of rhythmic effects the attention we
should. Instead, we have discussed drama in terms of plot,
character-reaction, atmosphere, quality, and so forth, without
noticing that in some dramas of the most convincing quality
we are obviously not held by any of these things separately
or together, but by a certain something which transcends
them, and which we call lamely "tragic effect" or "comic ef
fect." There is, of course, nothing so vague in existence. Con
sider plays so familiar as Twelfth Night or Hamlet: the plots
arc ragged, attenuated, and hackneyed, and the characters are
so widely varied from magnificent to ridiculous as to preclude
any solid effect from them as a group; the poetic line has
nothing to do with the dramatic effect as a whole; yet nobody
can deny that Twelfth Night is thoroughly in the comic mood,
or that Hamlet rises above a very bloody situation to a won
derfully unified exaltation of tragic impression. To say that
we 1 eel the comic effect or tragic effect is merely to state our
own responses, not to give a name to that singular force which
keeps each play progressing in its proper tone. We are actu
ally talking about the rhythm of performance, the underlying
music ol emotional ebb and flow which is the most direct
expression of the mood in which the author has chosen to
write and affect us. Many persons prefer to call it develop
ment or suspense, but both of these terms are far too narrow.
As one might expect from the opposed natures of the
tragic and the comic, their rhythms are sharply distinguished
from each other. In tragedy the rhythm is invariably delib
erate, even slow, but inevitable—a series of forward surges
to an end which we know we must see, retarded by our inner
unwillingness to approach that end; our chief interest is the
suffering protagonist, and it is our sympathy with him, our
resentment at the situation around him, which produces this
hanging back. (If a serious play be too rapid, we know by
instinct that it is not true tragedy; and without exception it
always is melodrama.) In comedy, on the other hand, we may
know what the end is to be and we may not, but in either
case, undeterred by any concentrated sympathy, and inter
ested in the situation, or a group of individuals, rather than
in one individual, we follow with zest a rhythm of perform
ance which urges ahead in a series of eager leaps, briskly
accompanying author and actors to the point where the clown
will be kicked, the fool displayed, the hypocrite unmasked,
the shrew tamed. We hope for the end as in tragedy we dread
it, and we are content to sit through the delay of this final
critical satisfaction because the author of good comedy knows
how to make his rhythm an increasingly exciting tide of tilil
lations and checks.
I use these somewhat physical terms advisedly, for—as
the emphasis I have allowed to pantomime might suggest—
the methods of comedy arc basically an appeal to almost
physical satisfactions. It is just here that the deepest differ
ence between comedy (the form) and the comic (the spirit)
can he seen. From the shortest vaudeville turn or rough farce,
up through the most refined satire or comedy of manners, it
may be truly said that the rhythm of performance is closely
analogous to the paroxysm of a gusty sneeze. We swing for
ward with increasing sensations of coming pleasure from
the first exposition of situation: comic hint—hesitation
further hint—hesitation—development we 'can almost fore
see—hesitation (the checks becoming shorter as the situation
rushes faster) —trembling moment of ma<t uncertainty
kksou'tion & satisfaction in an explosion of stored-up laugh
ter. Uncertainly and repetition are the fundamental ingre
dients of this snuff-box. The steps in the progress may be all
different from each other in high comedy, but for the most
part in all degrees of the art, the rush to satisfaction is but
repetition of one idea delicately varied; our increasing famil
iarity with it renders the variations more amusing and the
suspense more exciting, and provides in fact part of the pleas
ure in the final resolution —we suspected it all along, and we
are half relieved and half triumphant to see it arrive.
«
VI
In this eager flight to the critical point of the scene or the !
whole play, there is a muscular enjoyment of laughter so great ;
that it is no wonder the unthinking (—and Dryden!) ascribe
to it the whole delight of the comic; there is a domination of j
our milieu and its standards so pervasive that it is perhaps !
only too natural for the uncritical to assume its mere appear-1
a nee in settings, dialect, gesture, allusion, to be the essential !
comic. Moreover, there is the strong sense of experience
shared, existing among audience, actors, and unseen author,
which—even more directly than in tragic performances
gives us a sense of social existence which many persons term
sympathy. But the comic spirit resides in none of these
things, which arc really matters of comedy-method. To make !
the point clear, one has but to mention the maypole dance,
which includes all of these pleasing effects —hilarity, famil
iarity, common experience—and which is yet far from being

imy approach to the comic spirit. No; the essential comic is
the satisfaction in the critical point which is made by comedy
action, from examples such as clever Valentine overcome by
cleverer Angelica down to the kicking of the greater fool by
the lesser. It exists even at its crudest, not for action per so,
but in the words of Vanbrugh, to hold before each man
... a glass,
And show him of what species he's an ass'.
The geniality arising from a comic performance, which
makes strangers smile at each other as they leave the theatre,
may be social sympathy in a sense, but it is not the modern
sentimental sense oli tender kindness for our brother. It is
rather an admission that in tlie play we found an understand
ing of our standards and our follies, and that Puck's im
mortal comment upon mortals was a sound one. Comedy thus
leads to understanding and tolerance—but so does all art;
that is not the specific aim of the comic. The "social sym
pathy" immediately provoked by it comes from group soli
darity aroused to consciousness by critical play. Between the
animated gusto of sympathy such as that, and the tremuloufc
yearning of modern comedy-writers from the eighteenth cen
tury to the Barries (Sir .lames and Master Philip), there is
fixed a gulf of deep and all too unseen tides.
To add one more discussion lo the long list jiow extant J
concerning comedy and the comic spirit seems not so much j
a last straw as it is a waste of time; my only justification in
writing this paper is that I do not attempt a new definition of]
comedy nor add any further complexities, but that by pointing
out certain disregarded distinctions in the definitions already j
known, I hope to clarify somewhat the entanglement which
in these days prevails. The chief difficulty facing any modern
who attempts to discover precisely what comedy and the
comic may be, is the vagueness which surrounds these terms
and the plays written on the basis of that vagueness. In part,
the haziness of critics and writers is the result of an amiable j
wish to regard as comic everything which is not downright j
sad; in part it springs from a tendency to sentimentalize hu
mor, after the romantic fashion begun in the eighteenth cen
tury; in part it is sheer confusion of the elements of the
comic spirit with the methods of comedy (two differing
things). In general, the fashion is to assert that the chief j
source and the aim of the comic is sympathy.
It is necessary to begin making distinctions concerning |
comedy in the definition of the comic spirit itself, and with ]
the best will in the world to be original and modern, I still
must accept the observations of Aristotle and his followers
as the better definition: the comic shows men in their oll
moments as less than normally dignified and serene, and thus
indirectly criticizes their follies. If we allow 100 great an
accent upon sympathy to enter the comic, we not only blur
the outlines of comedy, but take away a primary element from
the sister-form of tragedy. Upon the general basis which sup
ports both forms —the unusual events which are sufficiently
removed from ordinary living lo be worth treating in art —
and with the understanding of civilized standards of living
which is inherent in both, it is tragedy which remains sym
pathetic because ils whole purpose and accent is individual
and subjective; comedy is primarily social and objective. 1
regret that the simplest illustration must he the time-worn
analogy of the worthy citizen falling llat with suddenness in
the street.
There we have ordinary life, universally recognizable, but
willi enough of the unusual to make a crude basis for art.
Some persons see Ihe action as unusual-and-humiliating—
these are the tragic spirits; some see it as unusual-and-incon
gruous—these are the comic spirits. The serious man thinks
of the matter in terms of himself, or of an individual who
can suffer as he himself has done; he either remembers how
much he was hurt by such a fall at one time, or sensitively
imagines how much he would he hurt by one; he admits that
such episodes are part of the common lot, and bows to the
laws of gravitation, but from his sympathetic point of view
he dreads the necessity of the admission while he makes if.
(It is this exercise of emotion struggling wtih reason which
provides the catharsis of tragedy.) The humorous man thinks
in terms of men and their ways rather distinctly of himself;
he accepts the necessary laws of life and conduct as good
things because they are, as far as anyone knows, a safe, sen-'
sible, comfortable —and inescapable- order, and he remains
amusedly aloof from those who break that order. 11 is the
reasonable social state of mind thus instinctively commenting
upon the deviations from it—really a feeling of delighted
superiority—in which the satisfaction of the comic consists.
ii
In answer to this defense of the older distinctions, there
arc innumerable arguments in favor of the sympathy of hu
mor. What of our pleasure in Tom Sawyer?—in I lie suburban
American types of Booth Tarkington?—in the better comic
strips such as Tuthill's Bungle and Fontaine Fox's Tooner
villc? What of the success of Sinclair Lewis' satiric novels?
Is not the delight we derive from these things a matter of
sympathetic recognition rather than of critical sense? I think
not. We see ourselves and our best-known neighbors in these
works, and the recognition causes pleasure, but this is only
an exaggeration of the element of familiarity necessary lo all
artistic effort; it is not the cause of laughter, of comic appre
ciation. The familiarity or recognition required for all ex
pression is, it is true, accentuated in comic material for the
very reason that it deals with the point of view of society, and
hence portrays the social order best known to the audience
whom the artist wishes lo amuse; but the true cause of the
laughter is Ihe ability to be aloof, to criticize.
This statement covers not only places and castes, but lime,
and even moods. A mature man regards familiar scenes of
American childhood with delight, beyond doubt, but even
more with the eye of an observer; and his amusement arises
largely because he is no longer the rascal or Ihe sufferer that
he was in his 'leens. The point is made especially clear by
Booth Tarkinglon's Seventeen, in which many episodes of
painfully recognizable difficulties occur; to the chief character
they are painful, and we may remember how painful analo
gous incidents in our own lives were, but in spite of that
sympathetic feeling, we laugh, because we now realize that
these things were errors, follies, or exaggerations, outside the
normal play of life in general. In like manner, we may re
member our experiences as dwellers in suburbs, in small
towns, in apartment houses, and recognize the peculiarities
and absurdities which accompany such experiences with
pleasure; but our mirth arises from the fact that we see these
familiar things from the point of view of society at its peace
ful norm, which is undisturbed by pettiness, bickering, and
ridiculous pretenses. Even though we still dwell on Main
Street in Suburbia, and recognize the episodes as matters
which surround us every day, we are removed in mood at least
lo flic attitude of a more normally sophisticated society.
Otherwise we do not enjoy the work in question at all. Proof
iu point is Ihe writing of Sinclair Lewis, the department called
Americana in the "American Mercury," the whole cllort ol the
"New Yorker" to poke fun at the provincialism of sophisti
cates theinsleves. In short, the comic spirit demands that we
look occasionally even upon ourselves as absurd specimens
deviating from Ihe serenity of the ideal standard.
Mr. Max Eastman indicates a leaning toward the belief
that Ihe comic is a matter of sympathies rather than observ
ant criticism, by adducing the example ol a baby laughing
delightedly at a watch dangled before it, or at sight ol another
baby. This is no more Ihe spirit of Ihe comic or of humor
than is the sudden laughter which often accompanies embar
rassment; it is no more related to comedy than the scream
with which nervous persons greet Ihe cry |{<)(>, can be related
lo tragedy. If is merely Ihe vocalized rellcx of 1 lie purely
physical sensation.
11 r
But if I he re has been confusion in dealing with Ihe broad
comic spirit itself, there has been confusion worse confounded
in the consideration of its cliiel expression, comedy, where er
rors somewhat resembling this one ol Mr. Eastman are com
mon. The first and most necessary distinction here is thai com
edy is not precisely the same thing as the comic spirit, though
by our smiling I can sec we think so. No definite form can be

the same thing as the spirit which animates it: the spirit is
always both broader and sharper, and the form is always
limited by the very effort to give the spirit concrete expression
—entangled by the necessity to attract and please. The author
must clothe his idea in terms which an audience may under
stand—.which means that he must deal in conventions which
he and they have agreed upon (not very consciously always);
and he must not only see that they are familiar enough, to
make his idea clear, but fresh and vivid enough to entertain.
This is the craft of art, just its the unusual-and-the-familiar
is the basic source-material of art; it is the vehicle of our
delight, but not its final cause. One might as well confuse the
idea of a journey to a given place with the automobile or the
roads which are the means of going thither. Yet students of
the comic have largely made just this confusion between the
comic spirit of a play and the laws or conventions of comedy,
the spoken play itself.
They are perhaps to justified in part by the paradox
that the conventions of comedy and tragedy (unlike the con
ventions of fiction) are decreed by the subjective or the ob
jective quality of the spirits they are representing. Tragedy,
dealing primarily with the individual and the struggles of the
spirit, is simple and stark; its situations are limited to those
in which the dignity of the chief character is enough to war
rant our sympathy; it may have little physical action—in fact
we resent the intrigue with which seventeenth century "trag
edies" were cluttered by authors all too anxious to please; and
since the familiar in tragedy is subdued below the awful,
conscious and complete verisimilitude is not necessary. Com
edy, on the other hand, requires almost the opposite of all
these elements, with the inevitable difficulty, to be faced at
once, that its social quality multiplies the number of conven
tions used, and once more creates confusion. Comedy deals
less with the individual than with a situation in which all the
characters of the play show forth the normal aspects of society
and the various ridiculous deviations from it; since it does
deal with the notions of society as the audience conceives
them, the situation may concern any groups, actions, and
places whatever, so long as the audience knows them to be
the general middle range of its own normal social existence- —
family life, for instance, is recognizable anywhere; it may
have little action, as in the comedies of wit, or—as in the
greater number of cases by far—it may depend more upon
hilarious actions than upon words alone, and in broad comedy
can serve the comic spirit well by pantomime exclusively. A
great deal of enjoyment in comedy is caused by the physical.
This contrast of tragic and comic conventions so far, may
seem to imply that the comic conventions are virtually un
limited and unchecked, but such is far from the case. As Ihc
accentuation of the social and the objective which underlies
all these conventions implies, the last general requirement of
comedy checks all the others: comedy can express its social
critical spirit only through familiar scenes and relationships,
and verisimilitude is required by the audience for ease in un
derstanding the chief point at issue. It is without doubt this
factor, so inevitable and general, added to the fact that much
of comic performance is frankly physical, that has brought
many moderns to believe that the comic and the realistic are
largely the same thing. Yet the briefest survey of comedies
shows how far from tile truth this view actually is.
iv
If realism were the foundation of the comic spirit, then
those plays adhering most closely to the actual habits peculiar
to their own day, or to the manners of a particular caste,
would he and remain the best comedies for that reason alone;
they do not. The comedies of Aristophanes, of Ben Jonson,
of the Restoration gentlemen, are good comedies in spite of
the fact that they need copious notes to explain their topical
allusions, rather than because of it. When we have become
sufficiently familiar with the life and times they represent,
when notes are no longer needed, the true use of realism in
comedy appears: the jests cause laughter through the short
hand of allusion, the play seems to run a hundred times faster,
so that the whole sparkles with entertainment, and we rush
ahead to the point of each scene and to the final purpose
of the play with a sense of breezy lightness. Hut that is all.
The physical imitation of reality which occupies so much of
comedy is useful in the same way—a lumbering walk pre
pares us for the entire character of the clumsy countryman,
who will misunderstand everything and overset whole situ
ations from his ignorance of town customs; a wink, a turn of
the hand, a resolute swing of the foot, speak volumes. In all
of this, the real is not the comic, or even all of comedy; it is
the hand-maid of these things, and to elevate it to the level
of the mistress spirit is to marry the serving maid to the
prince while the true princess is left to watch the geese and
cry upon Kalada.
The matter of speed, lo which I have just alluded brielly,

This statement covers not only places and castes, but lime,
and even moods. A mature man regards familiar scenes of
American childhood with delight, beyond doubt, but even
more with the eye of an observer; and his amusement arises
largely because he is no longer the rascal or Ihe sufferer that
he was in his 'leens. The point is made especially clear by
Booth Tarkinglon's Seventeen, in which many episodes of
painfully recognizable difficulties occur; to the chief character
they are painful, and we may remember how painful analo
gous incidents in our own lives were, but in spite of that
sympathetic feeling, we laugh, because we now realize that
these things were errors, follies, or exaggerations, outside the
normal play of life in general. In like manner, we may re
member our experiences as dwellers in suburbs, in small
towns, in apartment houses, and recognize the peculiarities
and absurdities which accompany such experiences with
pleasure; but our mirth arises from the fact that we see these
familiar things from the point of view of society at its peace
ful norm, which is undisturbed by pettiness, bickering, and
ridiculous pretenses. Even though we still dwell on Main
Street in Suburbia, and recognize the episodes as matters
which surround us every day, we are removed in mood at least
lo flic attitude of a more normally sophisticated society.
Otherwise we do not enjoy the work in question at all. Proof
iu point is Ihe writing of Sinclair Lewis, the department called
Americana in the "American Mercury," the whole cllort ol the
"New Yorker" to poke fun at the provincialism of sophisti
cates theinsleves. In short, the comic spirit demands that we
look occasionally even upon ourselves as absurd specimens
deviating from Ihe serenity of the ideal standard.
Mr. Max Eastman indicates a leaning toward the belief
that Ihe comic is a matter of sympathies rather than observ
ant criticism, by adducing the example ol a baby laughing
delightedly at a watch dangled before it, or at sight ol another
baby. This is no more Ihe spirit of Ihe comic or of humor
than is the sudden laughter which often accompanies embar
rassment; it is no more related to comedy than the scream
with which nervous persons greet Ihe cry |{<)(>, can be related
lo tragedy. If is merely Ihe vocalized rellcx of 1 lie purely
physical sensation.
11 r
But if I he re has been confusion in dealing with Ihe broad
comic spirit itself, there has been confusion worse confounded
in the consideration of its cliiel expression, comedy, where er
rors somewhat resembling this one ol Mr. Eastman are com
mon. The first and most necessary distinction here is thai com
edy is not precisely the same thing as the comic spirit, though
by our smiling I can sec we think so. No definite form can be

the same thing as the spirit which animates it: the spirit is
always both broader and sharper, and the form is always
limited by the very effort to give the spirit concrete expression
—entangled by the necessity to attract and please. The author
must clothe his idea in terms which an audience may under
stand—.which means that he must deal in conventions which
he and they have agreed upon (not very consciously always);
and he must not only see that they are familiar enough, to
make his idea clear, but fresh and vivid enough to entertain.
This is the craft of art, just its the unusual-and-the-familiar
is the basic source-material of art; it is the vehicle of our
delight, but not its final cause. One might as well confuse the
idea of a journey to a given place with the automobile or the
roads which are the means of going thither. Yet students of
the comic have largely made just this confusion between the
comic spirit of a play and the laws or conventions of comedy,
the spoken play itself.
They are perhaps to justified in part by the paradox
that the conventions of comedy and tragedy (unlike the con
ventions of fiction) are decreed by the subjective or the ob
jective quality of the spirits they are representing. Tragedy,
dealing primarily with the individual and the struggles of the
spirit, is simple and stark; its situations are limited to those
in which the dignity of the chief character is enough to war
rant our sympathy; it may have little physical action—in fact
we resent the intrigue with which seventeenth century "trag
edies" were cluttered by authors all too anxious to please; and
since the familiar in tragedy is subdued below the awful,
conscious and complete verisimilitude is not necessary. Com
edy, on the other hand, requires almost the opposite of all
these elements, with the inevitable difficulty, to be faced at
once, that its social quality multiplies the number of conven
tions used, and once more creates confusion. Comedy deals
less with the individual than with a situation in which all the
characters of the play show forth the normal aspects of society
and the various ridiculous deviations from it; since it does
deal with the notions of society as the audience conceives
them, the situation may concern any groups, actions, and
places whatever, so long as the audience knows them to be
the general middle range of its own normal social existence- —
family life, for instance, is recognizable anywhere; it may
have little action, as in the comedies of wit, or—as in the
greater number of cases by far—it may depend more upon
hilarious actions than upon words alone, and in broad comedy
can serve the comic spirit well by pantomime exclusively. A
great deal of enjoyment in comedy is caused by the physical.
This contrast of tragic and comic conventions so far, may
seem to imply that the comic conventions are virtually un
limited and unchecked, but such is far from the case. As Ihc
accentuation of the social and the objective which underlies
all these conventions implies, the last general requirement of
comedy checks all the others: comedy can express its social
critical spirit only through familiar scenes and relationships,
and verisimilitude is required by the audience for ease in un
derstanding the chief point at issue. It is without doubt this
factor, so inevitable and general, added to the fact that much
of comic performance is frankly physical, that has brought
many moderns to believe that the comic and the realistic are
largely the same thing. Yet the briefest survey of comedies
shows how far from tile truth this view actually is.
iv
If realism were the foundation of the comic spirit, then
those plays adhering most closely to the actual habits peculiar
to their own day, or to the manners of a particular caste,
would he and remain the best comedies for that reason alone;
they do not. The comedies of Aristophanes, of Ben Jonson,
of the Restoration gentlemen, are good comedies in spite of
the fact that they need copious notes to explain their topical
allusions, rather than because of it. When we have become
sufficiently familiar with the life and times they represent,
when notes are no longer needed, the true use of realism in
comedy appears: the jests cause laughter through the short
hand of allusion, the play seems to run a hundred times faster,
so that the whole sparkles with entertainment, and we rush
ahead to the point of each scene and to the final purpose
of the play with a sense of breezy lightness. Hut that is all.
The physical imitation of reality which occupies so much of
comedy is useful in the same way—a lumbering walk pre
pares us for the entire character of the clumsy countryman,
who will misunderstand everything and overset whole situ
ations from his ignorance of town customs; a wink, a turn of
the hand, a resolute swing of the foot, speak volumes. In all
of this, the real is not the comic, or even all of comedy; it is
the hand-maid of these things, and to elevate it to the level
of the mistress spirit is to marry the serving maid to the
prince while the true princess is left to watch the geese and
cry upon Kalada.
The matter of speed, lo which I have just alluded brielly,
is another of the.conventions peculiar lo dramatic composi
tion, which I have reserved lo a treatment, by itsell because
!of its somewhat involved character. It is obvious that the
dramatist must feel the limitations o! time as no other artist
need (| ( ,—even O'Neill and Shaw must bend their stiff necks
lo admit the necessity of restricting their actions lo a unified
and something like reasonable space ol time, il they are to
hold the attention of an audience. The playwright's tale must
he made clear, ils action must be represented by living per
sons in action, and his comic or tragic quality must be solidPv
j established, within limitations so sharp that it we were not
| accustomed to the convention by the usage ol centuries, we
should gasp at the rigor of the demand. Many minor conven
tions assist Ihe artist in effecting his tragic or comic quality
in the brief period of presentation: he makes his choice ac
cording to the results desired, between gloomy settings, sunny
ones, or imitations of actual scenes, between poetry and prose,
between the extended line and colloquial brevity; but without,
I think, being quite aware of il himself, he depends chiefly on
his instinctive sense of rhythm to produce the correct con
junction between his subject mailer and ils rale of progress.
(It is for this reason, of course, that the best playwrights have
always been men of Ihe theatre, either actors or constant
spectators, who have become imbued with the drama by ear.)
I know not whether any critic has dealt with the two chief
, forms ol drama in terms of their rhythm of progress; I have
seen no such discussion, and it is not odd, since we have only
lately paid to the matter of rhythmic effects the attention we
should. Instead, we have discussed drama in terms of plot,
character-reaction, atmosphere, quality, and so forth, without
noticing that in some dramas of the most convincing quality
we are obviously not held by any of these things separately
or together, but by a certain something which transcends
them, and which we call lamely "tragic effect" or "comic ef
fect." There is, of course, nothing so vague in existence. Con
sider plays so familiar as Twelfth Night or Hamlet: the plots
arc ragged, attenuated, and hackneyed, and the characters are
so widely varied from magnificent to ridiculous as to preclude
any solid effect from them as a group; the poetic line has
nothing to do with the dramatic effect as a whole; yet nobody
can deny that Twelfth Night is thoroughly in the comic mood,
or that Hamlet rises above a very bloody situation to a won
derfully unified exaltation of tragic impression. To say that
we 1 eel the comic effect or tragic effect is merely to state our
own responses, not to give a name to that singular force which
keeps each play progressing in its proper tone. We are actu
ally talking about the rhythm of performance, the underlying
music ol emotional ebb and flow which is the most direct
expression of the mood in which the author has chosen to
write and affect us. Many persons prefer to call it develop
ment or suspense, but both of these terms are far too narrow.
As one might expect from the opposed natures of the
tragic and the comic, their rhythms are sharply distinguished
from each other. In tragedy the rhythm is invariably delib
erate, even slow, but inevitable—a series of forward surges
to an end which we know we must see, retarded by our inner
unwillingness to approach that end; our chief interest is the
suffering protagonist, and it is our sympathy with him, our
resentment at the situation around him, which produces this
hanging back. (If a serious play be too rapid, we know by
instinct that it is not true tragedy; and without exception it
always is melodrama.) In comedy, on the other hand, we may
know what the end is to be and we may not, but in either
case, undeterred by any concentrated sympathy, and inter
ested in the situation, or a group of individuals, rather than
in one individual, we follow with zest a rhythm of perform
ance which urges ahead in a series of eager leaps, briskly
accompanying author and actors to the point where the clown
will be kicked, the fool displayed, the hypocrite unmasked,
the shrew tamed. We hope for the end as in tragedy we dread
it, and we are content to sit through the delay of this final
critical satisfaction because the author of good comedy knows
how to make his rhythm an increasingly exciting tide of tilil
lations and checks.
I use these somewhat physical terms advisedly, for—as
the emphasis I have allowed to pantomime might suggest—
the methods of comedy arc basically an appeal to almost
physical satisfactions. It is just here that the deepest differ
ence between comedy (the form) and the comic (the spirit)
can he seen. From the shortest vaudeville turn or rough farce,
up through the most refined satire or comedy of manners, it
may be truly said that the rhythm of performance is closely
analogous to the paroxysm of a gusty sneeze. We swing for
ward with increasing sensations of coming pleasure from
the first exposition of situation: comic hint—hesitation
further hint—hesitation—development we 'can almost fore
see—hesitation (the checks becoming shorter as the situation
rushes faster) —trembling moment of ma<t uncertainty
kksou'tion & satisfaction in an explosion of stored-up laugh
ter. Uncertainly and repetition are the fundamental ingre
dients of this snuff-box. The steps in the progress may be all
different from each other in high comedy, but for the most
part in all degrees of the art, the rush to satisfaction is but
repetition of one idea delicately varied; our increasing famil
iarity with it renders the variations more amusing and the
suspense more exciting, and provides in fact part of the pleas
ure in the final resolution —we suspected it all along, and we
are half relieved and half triumphant to see it arrive.

VI
In this eager flight to the critical point of the scene or the !
whole play, there is a muscular enjoyment of laughter so great ;
that it is no wonder the unthinking (—and Dryden!) ascribe
to it the whole delight of the comic; there is a domination of j
our milieu and its standards so pervasive that it is perhaps !
only too natural for the uncritical to assume its mere appear-1
a nee in settings, dialect, gesture, allusion, to be the essential !
comic. Moreover, there is the strong sense of experience
shared, existing among audience, actors, and unseen author,
which—even more directly than in tragic performances
gives us a sense of social existence which many persons term
sympathy. But the comic spirit resides in none of these
things, which arc really matters of comedy-method. To make !
the point clear, one has but to mention the maypole dance,
which includes all of these pleasing effects —hilarity, famil
iarity, common experience—and which is yet far from being

imy approach to the comic spirit. No; the essential comic is
the satisfaction in the critical point which is made by comedy
action, from examples such as clever Valentine overcome by
cleverer Angelica down to the kicking of the greater fool by
the lesser. It exists even at its crudest, not for action per so,
but in the words of Vanbrugh, to hold before each man
... a glass,
And show him of what species he's an ass'.
The geniality arising from a comic performance, which
makes strangers smile at each other as they leave the theatre,
may be social sympathy in a sense, but it is not the modern
sentimental sense oli tender kindness for our brother. It is
rather an admission that in tlie play we found an understand
ing of our standards and our follies, and that Puck's im
mortal comment upon mortals was a sound one. Comedy thus
leads to understanding and tolerance—but so does all art;
that is not the specific aim of the comic. The "social sym
pathy" immediately provoked by it comes from group soli
darity aroused to consciousness by critical play. Between the
animated gusto of sympathy such as that, and the tremuloufc
yearning of modern comedy-writers from the eighteenth cen
tury to the Barries (Sir .lames and Master Philip), there is
fixed a gulf of deep and all too unseen tides.
To add one more discussion lo the long list jiow extant J
concerning comedy and the comic spirit seems not so much j
a last straw as it is a waste of time; my only justification in
writing this paper is that I do not attempt a new definition of]
comedy nor add any further complexities, but that by pointing
out certain disregarded distinctions in the definitions already j
known, I hope to clarify somewhat the entanglement which
in these days prevails. The chief difficulty facing any modern
who attempts to discover precisely what comedy and the
comic may be, is the vagueness which surrounds these terms
and the plays written on the basis of that vagueness. In part,
the haziness of critics and writers is the result of an amiable j
wish to regard as comic everything which is not downright j
sad; in part it springs from a tendency to sentimentalize hu
mor, after the romantic fashion begun in the eighteenth cen
tury; in part it is sheer confusion of the elements of the
comic spirit with the methods of comedy (two differing
things). In general, the fashion is to assert that the chief j
source and the aim of the comic is sympathy.
It is necessary to begin making distinctions concerning |
comedy in the definition of the comic spirit itself, and with ]
the best will in the world to be original and modern, I still
must accept the observations of Aristotle and his followers
as the better definition: the comic shows men in their oll
moments as less than normally dignified and serene, and thus
indirectly criticizes their follies. If we allow 100 great an
accent upon sympathy to enter the comic, we not only blur
the outlines of comedy, but take away a primary element from
the sister-form of tragedy. Upon the general basis which sup
ports both forms —the unusual events which are sufficiently
removed from ordinary living lo be worth treating in art —
and with the understanding of civilized standards of living
which is inherent in both, it is tragedy which remains sym
pathetic because ils whole purpose and accent is individual
and subjective; comedy is primarily social and objective. 1
regret that the simplest illustration must he the time-worn
analogy of the worthy citizen falling llat with suddenness in
the street.
There we have ordinary life, universally recognizable, but
willi enough of the unusual to make a crude basis for art.
Some persons see Ihe action as unusual-and-humiliating—
these are the tragic spirits; some see it as unusual-and-incon
gruous—these are the comic spirits. The serious man thinks
of the matter in terms of himself, or of an individual who
can suffer as he himself has done; he either remembers how
much he was hurt by such a fall at one time, or sensitively
imagines how much he would he hurt by one; he admits that
such episodes are part of the common lot, and bows to the
laws of gravitation, but from his sympathetic point of view
he dreads the necessity of the admission while he makes if.
(It is this exercise of emotion struggling wtih reason which
provides the catharsis of tragedy.) The humorous man thinks
in terms of men and their ways rather distinctly of himself;
he accepts the necessary laws of life and conduct as good
things because they are, as far as anyone knows, a safe, sen-'
sible, comfortable —and inescapable- order, and he remains
amusedly aloof from those who break that order. 11 is the
reasonable social state of mind thus instinctively commenting
upon the deviations from it—really a feeling of delighted
superiority—in which the satisfaction of the comic consists.
ii
In answer to this defense of the older distinctions, there
arc innumerable arguments in favor of the sympathy of hu
mor. What of our pleasure in Tom Sawyer?—in I lie suburban
American types of Booth Tarkington?—in the better comic
strips such as Tuthill's Bungle and Fontaine Fox's Tooner
villc? What of the success of Sinclair Lewis' satiric novels?
Is not the delight we derive from these things a matter of
sympathetic recognition rather than of critical sense? I think
not. We see ourselves and our best-known neighbors in these
works, and the recognition causes pleasure, but this is only
an exaggeration of the element of familiarity necessary lo all
artistic effort; it is not the cause of laughter, of comic appre
ciation. The familiarity or recognition required for all ex
pression is, it is true, accentuated in comic material for the
very reason that it deals with the point of view of society, and
hence portrays the social order best known to the audience
whom the artist wishes lo amuse; but the true cause of the
laughter is Ihe ability to be aloof, to criticize.
This statement covers not only places and castes, but lime,
and even moods. A mature man regards familiar scenes of
American childhood with delight, beyond doubt, but even
more with the eye of an observer; and his amusement arises
largely because he is no longer the rascal or Ihe sufferer that
he was in his 'leens. The point is made especially clear by
Booth Tarkinglon's Seventeen, in which many episodes of
painfully recognizable difficulties occur; to the chief character
they are painful, and we may remember how painful analo
gous incidents in our own lives were, but in spite of that
sympathetic feeling, we laugh, because we now realize that
these things were errors, follies, or exaggerations, outside the
normal play of life in general. In like manner, we may re
member our experiences as dwellers in suburbs, in small
towns, in apartment houses, and recognize the peculiarities
and absurdities which accompany such experiences with
pleasure; but our mirth arises from the fact that we see these
familiar things from the point of view of society at its peace
ful norm, which is undisturbed by pettiness, bickering, and
ridiculous pretenses. Even though we still dwell on Main
Street in Suburbia, and recognize the episodes as matters
which surround us every day, we are removed in mood at least
lo flic attitude of a more normally sophisticated society.
Otherwise we do not enjoy the work in question at all. Proof
iu point is Ihe writing of Sinclair Lewis, the department called
Americana in the "American Mercury," the whole cllort ol the
"New Yorker" to poke fun at the provincialism of sophisti
cates theinsleves. In short, the comic spirit demands that we
look occasionally even upon ourselves as absurd specimens
deviating from Ihe serenity of the ideal standard.
Mr. Max Eastman indicates a leaning toward the belief
that Ihe comic is a matter of sympathies rather than observ
ant criticism, by adducing the example ol a baby laughing
delightedly at a watch dangled before it, or at sight ol another
baby. This is no more Ihe spirit of Ihe comic or of humor
than is the sudden laughter which often accompanies embar
rassment; it is no more related to comedy than the scream
with which nervous persons greet Ihe cry |{<)(>, can be related
lo tragedy. If is merely Ihe vocalized rellcx of 1 lie purely
physical sensation.
11 r
But if I he re has been confusion in dealing with Ihe broad
comic spirit itself, there has been confusion worse confounded
in the consideration of its cliiel expression, comedy, where er
rors somewhat resembling this one ol Mr. Eastman are com
mon. The first and most necessary distinction here is thai com
edy is not precisely the same thing as the comic spirit, though
by our smiling I can sec we think so. No definite form can be

the same thing as the spirit which animates it: the spirit is
always both broader and sharper, and the form is always
limited by the very effort to give the spirit concrete expression
—entangled by the necessity to attract and please. The author
must clothe his idea in terms which an audience may under
stand—.which means that he must deal in conventions which
he and they have agreed upon (not very consciously always);
and he must not only see that they are familiar enough, to
make his idea clear, but fresh and vivid enough to entertain.
This is the craft of art, just its the unusual-and-the-familiar
is the basic source-material of art; it is the vehicle of our
delight, but not its final cause. One might as well confuse the
idea of a journey to a given place with the automobile or the
roads which are the means of going thither. Yet students of
the comic have largely made just this confusion between the
comic spirit of a play and the laws or conventions of comedy,
the spoken play itself.
They are perhaps to justified in part by the paradox
that the conventions of comedy and tragedy (unlike the con
ventions of fiction) are decreed by the subjective or the ob
jective quality of the spirits they are representing. Tragedy,
dealing primarily with the individual and the struggles of the
spirit, is simple and stark; its situations are limited to those
in which the dignity of the chief character is enough to war
rant our sympathy; it may have little physical action—in fact
we resent the intrigue with which seventeenth century "trag
edies" were cluttered by authors all too anxious to please; and
since the familiar in tragedy is subdued below the awful,
conscious and complete verisimilitude is not necessary. Com
edy, on the other hand, requires almost the opposite of all
these elements, with the inevitable difficulty, to be faced at
once, that its social quality multiplies the number of conven
tions used, and once more creates confusion. Comedy deals
less with the individual than with a situation in which all the
characters of the play show forth the normal aspects of society
and the various ridiculous deviations from it; since it does
deal with the notions of society as the audience conceives
them, the situation may concern any groups, actions, and
places whatever, so long as the audience knows them to be
the general middle range of its own normal social existence- —
family life, for instance, is recognizable anywhere; it may
have little action, as in the comedies of wit, or—as in the
greater number of cases by far—it may depend more upon
hilarious actions than upon words alone, and in broad comedy
can serve the comic spirit well by pantomime exclusively. A
great deal of enjoyment in comedy is caused by the physical.
This contrast of tragic and comic conventions so far, may
seem to imply that the comic conventions are virtually un
limited and unchecked, but such is far from the case. As Ihc
accentuation of the social and the objective which underlies
all these conventions implies, the last general requirement of
comedy checks all the others: comedy can express its social
critical spirit only through familiar scenes and relationships,
and verisimilitude is required by the audience for ease in un
derstanding the chief point at issue. It is without doubt this
factor, so inevitable and general, added to the fact that much
of comic performance is frankly physical, that has brought
many moderns to believe that the comic and the realistic are
largely the same thing. Yet the briefest survey of comedies
shows how far from tile truth this view actually is.
iv
If realism were the foundation of the comic spirit, then
those plays adhering most closely to the actual habits peculiar
to their own day, or to the manners of a particular caste,
would he and remain the best comedies for that reason alone;
they do not. The comedies of Aristophanes, of Ben Jonson,
of the Restoration gentlemen, are good comedies in spite of
the fact that they need copious notes to explain their topical
allusions, rather than because of it. When we have become
sufficiently familiar with the life and times they represent,
when notes are no longer needed, the true use of realism in
comedy appears: the jests cause laughter through the short
hand of allusion, the play seems to run a hundred times faster,
so that the whole sparkles with entertainment, and we rush
ahead to the point of each scene and to the final purpose
of the play with a sense of breezy lightness. Hut that is all.

how to make his rhythm an increasingly exciting tide of tilil

different from each other in high comedy, but for the most
part in all degrees of the art, the rush to satisfaction is but
repetition of one idea delicately varied; our increasing famil
iarity with it renders the variations more amusing and the
suspense more exciting, and provides in fact part of the pleas
ure in the final resolution —we suspected it all along, and we
are half relieved and half triumphant to see it arrive.

In this eager flight to the critical point of the scene or the !
whole play, there is a muscular enjoyment of laughter so great ;
that it is no wonder the unthinking (—and Dryden!) ascribe
to it the whole delight of the comic; there is a domination of j
our milieu and its standards so pervasive that it is perhaps !
only too natural for the uncritical to assume its mere appear-1
a nee in settings, dialect, gesture, allusion, to be the essential !
comic. Moreover, there is the strong sense of experience
shared, existing among audience, actors, and unseen author,
which—even more directly than in tragic performances
gives us a sense of social existence which many persons term
sympathy. But the comic spirit resides in none of these
things, which arc really matters of comedy-method. To make !
the point clear, one has but to mention the maypole dance,
which includes all of these pleasing effects —hilarity, famil
iarity, common experience—and which is yet far from being

imy approach to the comic spirit. No; the essential comic is
the satisfaction in the critical point which is made by comedy
action, from examples such as clever Valentine overcome by
cleverer Angelica down to the kicking of the greater fool by
the lesser. It exists even at its crudest, not for action per so,
but in the words of Vanbrugh, to hold before each man
... a glass,
And show him of what species he's an ass'.
The geniality arising from a comic performance, which
makes strangers smile at each other as they leave the theatre,
may be social sympathy in a sense, but it is not the modern
sentimental sense oli tender kindness for our brother. It is
rather an admission that in tlie play we found an understand
ing of our standards and our follies, and that Puck's im
mortal comment upon mortals was a sound one. Comedy thus
leads to understanding and tolerance—but so does all art;
that is not the specific aim of the comic. The "social sym
pathy" immediately provoked by it comes from group soli
darity aroused to consciousness by critical play. Between the
animated gusto of sympathy such as that, and the tremuloufc
yearning of modern comedy-writers from the eighteenth cen
tury to the Barries (Sir .lames and Master Philip), there is
fixed a gulf of deep and all too unseen tides.
To add one more discussion lo the long list jiow extant J
concerning comedy and the comic spirit seems not so much j
a last straw as it is a waste of time; my only justification in
writing this paper is that I do not attempt a new definition of]
comedy nor add any further complexities, but that by pointing
out certain disregarded distinctions in the definitions already j
known, I hope to clarify somewhat the entanglement which
in these days prevails. The chief difficulty facing any modern
who attempts to discover precisely what comedy and the
comic may be, is the vagueness which surrounds these terms
and the plays written on the basis of that vagueness. In part,
the haziness of critics and writers is the result of an amiable j
wish to regard as comic everything which is not downright j
sad; in part it springs from a tendency to sentimentalize hu
mor, after the romantic fashion begun in the eighteenth cen
tury; in part it is sheer confusion of the elements of the
comic spirit with the methods of comedy (two differing
things). In general, the fashion is to assert that the chief j
source and the aim of the comic is sympathy.
It is necessary to begin making distinctions concerning |
comedy in the definition of the comic spirit itself, and with ]
the best will in the world to be original and modern, I still
must accept the observations of Aristotle and his followers
as the better definition: the comic shows men in their oll
moments as less than normally dignified and serene, and thus
indirectly criticizes their follies. If we allow 100 great an
accent upon sympathy to enter the comic, we not only blur
the outlines of comedy, but take away a primary element from
the sister-form of tragedy. Upon the general basis which sup
ports both forms —the unusual events which are sufficiently
removed from ordinary living lo be worth treating in art —
and with the understanding of civilized standards of living
which is inherent in both, it is tragedy which remains sym
pathetic because ils whole purpose and accent is individual
and subjective; comedy is primarily social and objective. 1
regret that the simplest illustration must he the time-worn
analogy of the worthy citizen falling llat with suddenness in
the street.
There we have ordinary life, universally recognizable, but
willi enough of the unusual to make a crude basis for art.
Some persons see Ihe action as unusual-and-humiliating—
these are the tragic spirits; some see it as unusual-and-incon
gruous—these are the comic spirits. The serious man thinks
of the matter in terms of himself, or of an individual who
can suffer as he himself has done; he either remembers how
much he was hurt by such a fall at one time, or sensitively
imagines how much he would he hurt by one; he admits that
such episodes are part of the common lot, and bows to the
laws of gravitation, but from his sympathetic point of view
he dreads the necessity of the admission while he makes if.
(It is this exercise of emotion struggling wtih reason which
provides the catharsis of tragedy.) The humorous man thinks
in terms of men and their ways rather distinctly of himself;
he accepts the necessary laws of life and conduct as good
things because they are, as far as anyone knows, a safe, sen-'
sible, comfortable —and inescapable- order, and he remains
amusedly aloof from those who break that order. 11 is the
reasonable social state of mind thus instinctively commenting
upon the deviations from it—really a feeling of delighted
superiority—in which the satisfaction of the comic consists.
ii
In answer to this defense of the older distinctions, there
arc innumerable arguments in favor of the sympathy of hu
mor. What of our pleasure in Tom Sawyer?—in I lie suburban
American types of Booth Tarkington?—in the better comic
strips such as Tuthill's Bungle and Fontaine Fox's Tooner
villc? What of the success of Sinclair Lewis' satiric novels?
Is not the delight we derive from these things a matter of
sympathetic recognition rather than of critical sense? I think
not. We see ourselves and our best-known neighbors in these
works, and the recognition causes pleasure, but this is only
an exaggeration of the element of familiarity necessary lo all
artistic effort; it is not the cause of laughter, of comic appre
ciation. The familiarity or recognition required for all ex
pression is, it is true, accentuated in comic material for the
very reason that it deals with the point of view of society, and
hence portrays the social order best known to the audience
whom the artist wishes lo amuse; but the true cause of the
laughter is Ihe ability to be aloof, to criticize.
This statement covers not only places and castes, but lime,
and even moods. A mature man regards familiar scenes of
American childhood with delight, beyond doubt, but even
more with the eye of an observer; and his amusement arises
largely because he is no longer the rascal or Ihe sufferer that
he was in his 'leens. The point is made especially clear by
Booth Tarkinglon's Seventeen, in which many episodes of
painfully recognizable difficulties occur; to the chief character
they are painful, and we may remember how painful analo
gous incidents in our own lives were, but in spite of that
sympathetic feeling, we laugh, because we now realize that
these things were errors, follies, or exaggerations, outside the
normal play of life in general. In like manner, we may re
member our experiences as dwellers in suburbs, in small
towns, in apartment houses, and recognize the peculiarities
and absurdities which accompany such experiences with
pleasure; but our mirth arises from the fact that we see these
familiar things from the point of view of society at its peace
ful norm, which is undisturbed by pettiness, bickering, and
ridiculous pretenses. Even though we still dwell on Main
Street in Suburbia, and recognize the episodes as matters
which surround us every day, we are removed in mood at least
lo flic attitude of a more normally sophisticated society.
Otherwise we do not enjoy the work in question at all. Proof
iu point is Ihe writing of Sinclair Lewis, the department called
Americana in the "American Mercury," the whole cllort ol the
"New Yorker" to poke fun at the provincialism of sophisti
cates theinsleves. In short, the comic spirit demands that we
look occasionally even upon ourselves as absurd specimens
deviating from Ihe serenity of the ideal standard.
Mr. Max Eastman indicates a leaning toward the belief
that Ihe comic is a matter of sympathies rather than observ
ant criticism, by adducing the example ol a baby laughing
delightedly at a watch dangled before it, or at sight ol another
baby. This is no more Ihe spirit of Ihe comic or of humor
than is the sudden laughter which often accompanies embar
rassment; it is no more related to comedy than the scream
with which nervous persons greet Ihe cry |{<)(>, can be related
lo tragedy. If is merely Ihe vocalized rellcx of 1 lie purely
physical sensation.
11 r
But if I he re has been confusion in dealing with Ihe broad
comic spirit itself, there has been confusion worse confounded
in the consideration of its cliiel expression, comedy, where er
rors somewhat resembling this one ol Mr. Eastman are com
mon. The first and most necessary distinction here is thai com
edy is not precisely the same thing as the comic spirit, though
by our smiling I can sec we think so. No definite form can be

the same thing as the spirit which animates it: the spirit is
always both broader and sharper, and the form is always
limited by the very effort to give the spirit concrete expression
—entangled by the necessity to attract and please. The author
must clothe his idea in terms which an audience may under
stand—.which means that he must deal in conventions which
he and they have agreed upon (not very consciously always);
and he must not only see that they are familiar enough, to
make his idea clear, but fresh and vivid enough to entertain.
This is the craft of art, just its the unusual-and-the-familiar
is the basic source-material of art; it is the vehicle of our
delight, but not its final cause. One might as well confuse the
idea of a journey to a given place with the automobile or the
roads which are the means of going thither. Yet students of
the comic have largely made just this confusion between the
comic spirit of a play and the laws or conventions of comedy,
the spoken play itself.
They are perhaps to justified in part by the paradox
that the conventions of comedy and tragedy (unlike the con
ventions of fiction) are decreed by the subjective or the ob
jective quality of the spirits they are representing. Tragedy,
dealing primarily with the individual and the struggles of the
spirit, is simple and stark; its situations are limited to those
in which the dignity of the chief character is enough to war
rant our sympathy; it may have little physical action—in fact
we resent the intrigue with which seventeenth century "trag
edies" were cluttered by authors all too anxious to please; and
since the familiar in tragedy is subdued below the awful,
conscious and complete verisimilitude is not necessary. Com
edy, on the other hand, requires almost the opposite of all
these elements, with the inevitable difficulty, to be faced at
once, that its social quality multiplies the number of conven
tions used, and once more creates confusion. Comedy deals
less with the individual than with a situation in which all the
characters of the play show forth the normal aspects of society
and the various ridiculous deviations from it; since it does
deal with the notions of society as the audience conceives
them, the situation may concern any groups, actions, and
places whatever, so long as the audience knows them to be
the general middle range of its own normal social existence- —
family life, for instance, is recognizable anywhere; it may
have little action, as in the comedies of wit, or—as in the
greater number of cases by far—it may depend more upon
hilarious actions than upon words alone, and in broad comedy
can serve the comic spirit well by pantomime exclusively. A
great deal of enjoyment in comedy is caused by the physical.
This contrast of tragic and comic conventions so far, may
seem to imply that the comic conventions are virtually un
limited and unchecked, but such is far from the case. As Ihc
accentuation of the social and the objective which underlies
all these conventions implies, the last general requirement of
comedy checks all the others: comedy can express its social
critical spirit only through familiar scenes and relationships,
and verisimilitude is required by the audience for ease in un
derstanding the chief point at issue. It is without doubt this
factor, so inevitable and general, added to the fact that much
of comic performance is frankly physical, that has brought
many moderns to believe that the comic and the realistic are
largely the same thing. Yet the briefest survey of comedies
shows how far from tile truth this view actually is.
iv
If realism were the foundation of the comic spirit, then
those plays adhering most closely to the actual habits peculiar
to their own day, or to the manners of a particular caste,
would he and remain the best comedies for that reason alone;
they do not. The comedies of Aristophanes, of Ben Jonson,
of the Restoration gentlemen, are good comedies in spite of
the fact that they need copious notes to explain their topical
allusions, rather than because of it. When we have become
sufficiently familiar with the life and times they represent,
when notes are no longer needed, the true use of realism in
comedy appears: the jests cause laughter through the short
hand of allusion, the play seems to run a hundred times faster,
so that the whole sparkles with entertainment, and we rush
ahead to the point of each scene and to the final purpose
of the play with a sense of breezy lightness. Hut that is all.
The physical imitation of reality which occupies so much of
comedy is useful in the same way—a lumbering walk pre
pares us for the entire character of the clumsy countryman,
who will misunderstand everything and overset whole situ
ations from his ignorance of town customs; a wink, a turn of
the hand, a resolute swing of the foot, speak volumes. In all
of this, the real is not the comic, or even all of comedy; it is
the hand-maid of these things, and to elevate it to the level
of the mistress spirit is to marry the serving maid to the
prince while the true princess is left to watch the geese and
cry upon Kalada.
The matter of speed, lo which I have just alluded brielly,
is another of the.conventions peculiar lo dramatic composi
tion, which I have reserved lo a treatment, by itsell because
!of its somewhat involved character. It is obvious that the
dramatist must feel the limitations o! time as no other artist
need (| ( ,—even O'Neill and Shaw must bend their stiff necks
lo admit the necessity of restricting their actions lo a unified
and something like reasonable space ol time, il they are to
hold the attention of an audience. The playwright's tale must
he made clear, ils action must be represented by living per
sons in action, and his comic or tragic quality must be solidPv
j established, within limitations so sharp that it we were not
| accustomed to the convention by the usage ol centuries, we
should gasp at the rigor of the demand. Many minor conven
tions assist Ihe artist in effecting his tragic or comic quality
in the brief period of presentation: he makes his choice ac
cording to the results desired, between gloomy settings, sunny
ones, or imitations of actual scenes, between poetry and prose,
between the extended line and colloquial brevity; but without,
I think, being quite aware of il himself, he depends chiefly on
his instinctive sense of rhythm to produce the correct con
junction between his subject mailer and ils rale of progress.
(It is for this reason, of course, that the best playwrights have
always been men of Ihe theatre, either actors or constant
spectators, who have become imbued with the drama by ear.)
I know not whether any critic has dealt with the two chief
, forms ol drama in terms of their rhythm of progress; I have
seen no such discussion, and it is not odd, since we have only
lately paid to the matter of rhythmic effects the attention we
should. Instead, we have discussed drama in terms of plot,
character-reaction, atmosphere, quality, and so forth, without
noticing that in some dramas of the most convincing quality
we are obviously not held by any of these things separately
or together, but by a certain something which transcends
them, and which we call lamely "tragic effect" or "comic ef
fect." There is, of course, nothing so vague in existence. Con
sider plays so familiar as Twelfth Night or Hamlet: the plots
arc ragged, attenuated, and hackneyed, and the characters are
so widely varied from magnificent to ridiculous as to preclude
any solid effect from them as a group; the poetic line has
nothing to do with the dramatic effect as a whole; yet nobody
can deny that Twelfth Night is thoroughly in the comic mood,
or that Hamlet rises above a very bloody situation to a won
derfully unified exaltation of tragic impression. To say that
we 1 eel the comic effect or tragic effect is merely to state our
own responses, not to give a name to that singular force which
keeps each play progressing in its proper tone. We are actu
ally talking about the rhythm of performance, the underlying
music ol emotional ebb and flow which is the most direct
expression of the mood in which the author has chosen to
write and affect us. Many persons prefer to call it develop
ment or suspense, but both of these terms are far too narrow.
As one might expect from the opposed natures of the
tragic and the comic, their rhythms are sharply distinguished
from each other. In tragedy the rhythm is invariably delib
erate, even slow, but inevitable—a series of forward surges
to an end which we know we must see, retarded by our inner
unwillingness to approach that end; our chief interest is the
suffering protagonist, and it is our sympathy with him, our
resentment at the situation around him, which produces this
hanging back. (If a serious play be too rapid, we know by
instinct that it is not true tragedy; and without exception it
always is melodrama.) In comedy, on the other hand, we may
know what the end is to be and we may not, but in either
case, undeterred by any concentrated sympathy, and inter
ested in the situation, or a group of individuals, rather than
in one individual, we follow with zest a rhythm of perform
ance which urges ahead in a series of eager leaps, briskly
accompanying author and actors to the point where the clown
will be kicked, the fool displayed, the hypocrite unmasked,
the shrew tamed. We hope for the end as in tragedy we dread
it, and we are content to sit through the delay of this final
critical satisfaction because the author of good comedy knows
how to make his rhythm an increasingly exciting tide of tilil
lations and checks.
I use these somewhat physical terms advisedly, for—as
the emphasis I have allowed to pantomime might suggest—
the methods of comedy arc basically an appeal to almost
physical satisfactions. It is just here that the deepest differ
ence between comedy (the form) and the comic (the spirit)
can he seen. From the shortest vaudeville turn or rough farce,
up through the most refined satire or comedy of manners, it
may be truly said that the rhythm of performance is closely
analogous to the paroxysm of a gusty sneeze. We swing for
ward with increasing sensations of coming pleasure from
the first exposition of situation: comic hint—hesitation
further hint—hesitation—development we 'can almost fore
see—hesitation (the checks becoming shorter as the situation
rushes faster) —trembling moment of ma<t uncertainty
kksou'tion & satisfaction in an explosion of stored-up laugh
ter. Uncertainly and repetition are the fundamental ingre
dients of this snuff-box. The steps in the progress may be all
different from each other in high comedy, but for the most
part in all degrees of the art, the rush to satisfaction is but
repetition of one idea delicately varied; our increasing famil
iarity with it renders the variations more amusing and the
suspense more exciting, and provides in fact part of the pleas
ure in the final resolution —we suspected it all along, and we
are half relieved and half triumphant to see it arrive.

But if I he re has been confusion in dealing with Ihe broad

in the consideration of its cliiel expression, comedy, where er
rors somewhat resembling this one ol Mr. Eastman are com
mon. The first and most necessary distinction here is thai com
edy is not precisely the same thing as the comic spirit, though
by our smiling I can sec we think so. No definite form can be

the same thing as the spirit which animates it: the spirit is
always both broader and sharper, and the form is always
limited by the very effort to give the spirit concrete expression
—entangled by the necessity to attract and please. The author
must clothe his idea in terms which an audience may under
stand—.which means that he must deal in conventions which
he and they have agreed upon (not very consciously always);
and he must not only see that they are familiar enough, to
make his idea clear, but fresh and vivid enough to entertain.
This is the craft of art, just its the unusual-and-the-familiar
is the basic source-material of art; it is the vehicle of our
delight, but not its final cause. One might as well confuse the
idea of a journey to a given place with the automobile or the
roads which are the means of going thither. Yet students of
the comic have largely made just this confusion between the
comic spirit of a play and the laws or conventions of comedy,
the spoken play itself.
They are perhaps to justified in part by the paradox
that the conventions of comedy and tragedy (unlike the con
ventions of fiction) are decreed by the subjective or the ob
jective quality of the spirits they are representing. Tragedy,
dealing primarily with the individual and the struggles of the
spirit, is simple and stark; its situations are limited to those
in which the dignity of the chief character is enough to war
rant our sympathy; it may have little physical action—in fact
we resent the intrigue with which seventeenth century "trag
edies" were cluttered by authors all too anxious to please; and
since the familiar in tragedy is subdued below the awful,
conscious and complete verisimilitude is not necessary. Com
edy, on the other hand, requires almost the opposite of all
these elements, with the inevitable difficulty, to be faced at
once, that its social quality multiplies the number of conven
tions used, and once more creates confusion. Comedy deals
less with the individual than with a situation in which all the
characters of the play show forth the normal aspects of society
and the various ridiculous deviations from it; since it does
deal with the notions of society as the audience conceives
them, the situation may concern any groups, actions, and
places whatever, so long as the audience knows them to be
the general middle range of its own normal social existence- —
family life, for instance, is recognizable anywhere; it may
have little action, as in the comedies of wit, or—as in the
greater number of cases by far—it may depend more upon
hilarious actions than upon words alone, and in broad comedy
can serve the comic spirit well by pantomime exclusively. A
great deal of enjoyment in comedy is caused by the physical.
This contrast of tragic and comic conventions so far, may
seem to imply that the comic conventions are virtually un
limited and unchecked, but such is far from the case. As Ihc
accentuation of the social and the objective which underlies
all these conventions implies, the last general requirement of
comedy checks all the others: comedy can express its social
critical spirit only through familiar scenes and relationships,
and verisimilitude is required by the audience for ease in un
derstanding the chief point at issue. It is without doubt this
factor, so inevitable and general, added to the fact that much
of comic performance is frankly physical, that has brought
many moderns to believe that the comic and the realistic are
largely the same thing. Yet the briefest survey of comedies
shows how far from tile truth this view actually is.
iv
If realism were the foundation of the comic spirit, then
those plays adhering most closely to the actual habits peculiar
to their own day, or to the manners of a particular caste,
would he and remain the best comedies for that reason alone;
they do not. The comedies of Aristophanes, of Ben Jonson,
of the Restoration gentlemen, are good comedies in spite of
the fact that they need copious notes to explain their topical
allusions, rather than because of it. When we have become
sufficiently familiar with the life and times they represent,
when notes are no longer needed, the true use of realism in
comedy appears: the jests cause laughter through the short
hand of allusion, the play seems to run a hundred times faster,
so that the whole sparkles with entertainment, and we rush
ahead to the point of each scene and to the final purpose
of the play with a sense of breezy lightness. Hut that is all.
The physical imitation of reality which occupies so much of
comedy is useful in the same way—a lumbering walk pre
pares us for the entire character of the clumsy countryman,
who will misunderstand everything and overset whole situ
ations from his ignorance of town customs; a wink, a turn of
the hand, a resolute swing of the foot, speak volumes. In all
of this, the real is not the comic, or even all of comedy; it is
the hand-maid of these things, and to elevate it to the level
of the mistress spirit is to marry the serving maid to the
prince while the true princess is left to watch the geese and
cry upon Kalada.
The matter of speed, lo which I have just alluded brielly,
is another of the.conventions peculiar lo dramatic composi
tion, which I have reserved lo a treatment, by itsell because
!of its somewhat involved character. It is obvious that the
dramatist must feel the limitations o! time as no other artist
need (| ( ,—even O'Neill and Shaw must bend their stiff necks
lo admit the necessity of restricting their actions lo a unified
and something like reasonable space ol time, il they are to
hold the attention of an audience. The playwright's tale must
he made clear, ils action must be represented by living per
sons in action, and his comic or tragic quality must be solidPv
j established, within limitations so sharp that it we were not
| accustomed to the convention by the usage ol centuries, we
should gasp at the rigor of the demand. Many minor conven
tions assist Ihe artist in effecting his tragic or comic quality
in the brief period of presentation: he makes his choice ac
cording to the results desired, between gloomy settings, sunny
ones, or imitations of actual scenes, between poetry and prose,
between the extended line and colloquial brevity; but without,
I think, being quite aware of il himself, he depends chiefly on
his instinctive sense of rhythm to produce the correct con
junction between his subject mailer and ils rale of progress.
(It is for this reason, of course, that the best playwrights have
always been men of Ihe theatre, either actors or constant
spectators, who have become imbued with the drama by ear.)
I know not whether any critic has dealt with the two chief
, forms ol drama in terms of their rhythm of progress; I have
seen no such discussion, and it is not odd, since we have only
lately paid to the matter of rhythmic effects the attention we
should. Instead, we have discussed drama in terms of plot,
character-reaction, atmosphere, quality, and so forth, without
noticing that in some dramas of the most convincing quality
we are obviously not held by any of these things separately
or together, but by a certain something which transcends
them, and which we call lamely "tragic effect" or "comic ef
fect." There is, of course, nothing so vague in existence. Con
sider plays so familiar as Twelfth Night or Hamlet: the plots
arc ragged, attenuated, and hackneyed, and the characters are
so widely varied from magnificent to ridiculous as to preclude
any solid effect from them as a group; the poetic line has
nothing to do with the dramatic effect as a whole; yet nobody
can deny that Twelfth Night is thoroughly in the comic mood,
or that Hamlet rises above a very bloody situation to a won
derfully unified exaltation of tragic impression. To say that
we 1 eel the comic effect or tragic effect is merely to state our
own responses, not to give a name to that singular force which
keeps each play progressing in its proper tone. We are actu
ally talking about the rhythm of performance, the underlying
music ol emotional ebb and flow which is the most direct
expression of the mood in which the author has chosen to
write and affect us. Many persons prefer to call it develop
ment or suspense, but both of these terms are far too narrow.
As one might expect from the opposed natures of the
tragic and the comic, their rhythms are sharply distinguished
from each other. In tragedy the rhythm is invariably delib
erate, even slow, but inevitable—a series of forward surges
to an end which we know we must see, retarded by our inner
unwillingness to approach that end; our chief interest is the
suffering protagonist, and it is our sympathy with him, our
resentment at the situation around him, which produces this
hanging back. (If a serious play be too rapid, we know by
instinct that it is not true tragedy; and without exception it
always is melodrama.) In comedy, on the other hand, we may
know what the end is to be and we may not, but in either
case, undeterred by any concentrated sympathy, and inter
ested in the situation, or a group of individuals, rather than
in one individual, we follow with zest a rhythm of perform
ance which urges ahead in a series of eager leaps, briskly
accompanying author and actors to the point where the clown
will be kicked, the fool displayed, the hypocrite unmasked,
the shrew tamed. We hope for the end as in tragedy we dread
it, and we are content to sit through the delay of this final
critical satisfaction because the author of good comedy knows
how to make his rhythm an increasingly exciting tide of tilil
lations and checks.
I use these somewhat physical terms advisedly, for—as
the emphasis I have allowed to pantomime might suggest—
the methods of comedy arc basically an appeal to almost
physical satisfactions. It is just here that the deepest differ
ence between comedy (the form) and the comic (the spirit)
can he seen. From the shortest vaudeville turn or rough farce,
up through the most refined satire or comedy of manners, it
may be truly said that the rhythm of performance is closely
analogous to the paroxysm of a gusty sneeze. We swing for
ward with increasing sensations of coming pleasure from
the first exposition of situation: comic hint—hesitation
further hint—hesitation—development we 'can almost fore
see—hesitation (the checks becoming shorter as the situation
rushes faster) —trembling moment of ma<t uncertainty
kksou'tion & satisfaction in an explosion of stored-up laugh
ter. Uncertainly and repetition are the fundamental ingre
dients of this snuff-box. The steps in the progress may be all
different from each other in high comedy, but for the most
part in all degrees of the art, the rush to satisfaction is but
repetition of one idea delicately varied; our increasing famil
iarity with it renders the variations more amusing and the
suspense more exciting, and provides in fact part of the pleas
ure in the final resolution —we suspected it all along, and we
are half relieved and half triumphant to see it arrive.
«
VI
In this eager flight to the critical point of the scene or the !
whole play, there is a muscular enjoyment of laughter so great ;
that it is no wonder the unthinking (—and Dryden!) ascribe
to it the whole delight of the comic; there is a domination of j
our milieu and its standards so pervasive that it is perhaps !
only too natural for the uncritical to assume its mere appear-1
a nee in settings, dialect, gesture, allusion, to be the essential !
comic. Moreover, there is the strong sense of experience
shared, existing among audience, actors, and unseen author,
which—even more directly than in tragic performances
gives us a sense of social existence which many persons term
sympathy. But the comic spirit resides in none of these
things, which arc really matters of comedy-method. To make !
the point clear, one has but to mention the maypole dance,
which includes all of these pleasing effects —hilarity, famil
iarity, common experience—and which is yet far from being

imy approach to the comic spirit. No; the essential comic is
the satisfaction in the critical point which is made by comedy
action, from examples such as clever Valentine overcome by
cleverer Angelica down to the kicking of the greater fool by
the lesser. It exists even at its crudest, not for action per so,
but in the words of Vanbrugh, to hold before each man
... a glass,
And show him of what species he's an ass'.
The geniality arising from a comic performance, which
makes strangers smile at each other as they leave the theatre,
may be social sympathy in a sense, but it is not the modern
sentimental sense oli tender kindness for our brother. It is
rather an admission that in tlie play we found an understand
ing of our standards and our follies, and that Puck's im
mortal comment upon mortals was a sound one. Comedy thus
leads to understanding and tolerance—but so does all art;
that is not the specific aim of the comic. The "social sym
pathy" immediately provoked by it comes from group soli
darity aroused to consciousness by critical play. Between the
animated gusto of sympathy such as that, and the tremuloufc
yearning of modern comedy-writers from the eighteenth cen
tury to the Barries (Sir .lames and Master Philip), there is
fixed a gulf of deep and all too unseen tides.
To add one more discussion lo the long list jiow extant J
concerning comedy and the comic spirit seems not so much j
a last straw as it is a waste of time; my only justification in
writing this paper is that I do not attempt a new definition of]
comedy nor add any further complexities, but that by pointing
out certain disregarded distinctions in the definitions already j
known, I hope to clarify somewhat the entanglement which
in these days prevails. The chief difficulty facing any modern
who attempts to discover precisely what comedy and the
comic may be, is the vagueness which surrounds these terms
and the plays written on the basis of that vagueness. In part,
the haziness of critics and writers is the result of an amiable j
wish to regard as comic everything which is not downright j
sad; in part it springs from a tendency to sentimentalize hu
mor, after the romantic fashion begun in the eighteenth cen
tury; in part it is sheer confusion of the elements of the
comic spirit with the methods of comedy (two differing
things). In general, the fashion is to assert that the chief j
source and the aim of the comic is sympathy.
It is necessary to begin making distinctions concerning |
comedy in the definition of the comic spirit itself, and with ]
the best will in the world to be original and modern, I still
must accept the observations of Aristotle and his followers
as the better definition: the comic shows men in their oll
moments as less than normally dignified and serene, and thus
indirectly criticizes their follies. If we allow 100 great an
accent upon sympathy to enter the comic, we not only blur
the outlines of comedy, but take away a primary element from
the sister-form of tragedy. Upon the general basis which sup
ports both forms —the unusual events which are sufficiently
removed from ordinary living lo be worth treating in art —
and with the understanding of civilized standards of living
which is inherent in both, it is tragedy which remains sym
pathetic because ils whole purpose and accent is individual
and subjective; comedy is primarily social and objective. 1
regret that the simplest illustration must he the time-worn
analogy of the worthy citizen falling llat with suddenness in
the street.
There we have ordinary life, universally recognizable, but
willi enough of the unusual to make a crude basis for art.
Some persons see Ihe action as unusual-and-humiliating—
these are the tragic spirits; some see it as unusual-and-incon
gruous—these are the comic spirits. The serious man thinks
of the matter in terms of himself, or of an individual who
can suffer as he himself has done; he either remembers how
much he was hurt by such a fall at one time, or sensitively
imagines how much he would he hurt by one; he admits that
such episodes are part of the common lot, and bows to the
laws of gravitation, but from his sympathetic point of view
he dreads the necessity of the admission while he makes if.
(It is this exercise of emotion struggling wtih reason which
provides the catharsis of tragedy.) The humorous man thinks
in terms of men and their ways rather distinctly of himself;
he accepts the necessary laws of life and conduct as good
things because they are, as far as anyone knows, a safe, sen-'
sible, comfortable —and inescapable- order, and he remains
amusedly aloof from those who break that order. 11 is the
reasonable social state of mind thus instinctively commenting
upon the deviations from it—really a feeling of delighted
superiority—in which the satisfaction of the comic consists.
ii
In answer to this defense of the older distinctions, there
arc innumerable arguments in favor of the sympathy of hu
mor. What of our pleasure in Tom Sawyer?—in I lie suburban
American types of Booth Tarkington?—in the better comic
strips such as Tuthill's Bungle and Fontaine Fox's Tooner
villc? What of the success of Sinclair Lewis' satiric novels?
Is not the delight we derive from these things a matter of
sympathetic recognition rather than of critical sense? I think
not. We see ourselves and our best-known neighbors in these
works, and the recognition causes pleasure, but this is only
an exaggeration of the element of familiarity necessary lo all
artistic effort; it is not the cause of laughter, of comic appre
ciation. The familiarity or recognition required for all ex
pression is, it is true, accentuated in comic material for the
very reason that it deals with the point of view of society, and
hence portrays the social order best known to the audience
whom the artist wishes lo amuse; but the true cause of the
laughter is Ihe ability to be aloof, to criticize.
This statement covers not only places and castes, but lime,
and even moods. A mature man regards familiar scenes of
American childhood with delight, beyond doubt, but even
more with the eye of an observer; and his amusement arises
largely because he is no longer the rascal or Ihe sufferer that
he was in his 'leens. The point is made especially clear by
Booth Tarkinglon's Seventeen, in which many episodes of
painfully recognizable difficulties occur; to the chief character
they are painful, and we may remember how painful analo
gous incidents in our own lives were, but in spite of that
sympathetic feeling, we laugh, because we now realize that
these things were errors, follies, or exaggerations, outside the
normal play of life in general. In like manner, we may re
member our experiences as dwellers in suburbs, in small
towns, in apartment houses, and recognize the peculiarities
and absurdities which accompany such experiences with
pleasure; but our mirth arises from the fact that we see these
familiar things from the point of view of society at its peace
ful norm, which is undisturbed by pettiness, bickering, and
ridiculous pretenses. Even though we still dwell on Main
Street in Suburbia, and recognize the episodes as matters
which surround us every day, we are removed in mood at least
lo flic attitude of a more normally sophisticated society.
Otherwise we do not enjoy the work in question at all. Proof
iu point is Ihe writing of Sinclair Lewis, the department called
Americana in the "American Mercury," the whole cllort ol the
"New Yorker" to poke fun at the provincialism of sophisti
cates theinsleves. In short, the comic spirit demands that we
look occasionally even upon ourselves as absurd specimens
deviating from Ihe serenity of the ideal standard.
Mr. Max Eastman indicates a leaning toward the belief
that Ihe comic is a matter of sympathies rather than observ
ant criticism, by adducing the example ol a baby laughing
delightedly at a watch dangled before it, or at sight ol another
baby. This is no more Ihe spirit of Ihe comic or of humor
than is the sudden laughter which often accompanies embar
rassment; it is no more related to comedy than the scream
with which nervous persons greet Ihe cry |{<)(>, can be related
lo tragedy. If is merely Ihe vocalized rellcx of 1 lie purely
physical sensation.
11 r
But if I he re has been confusion in dealing with Ihe broad
comic spirit itself, there has been confusion worse confounded
in the consideration of its cliiel expression, comedy, where er
rors somewhat resembling this one ol Mr. Eastman are com
mon. The first and most necessary distinction here is thai com
edy is not precisely the same thing as the comic spirit, though
by our smiling I can sec we think so. No definite form can be

the same thing as the spirit which animates it: the spirit is
always both broader and sharper, and the form is always
limited by the very effort to give the spirit concrete expression
—entangled by the necessity to attract and please. The author
must clothe his idea in terms which an audience may under
stand—.which means that he must deal in conventions which
he and they have agreed upon (not very consciously always);
and he must not only see that they are familiar enough, to
make his idea clear, but fresh and vivid enough to entertain.
This is the craft of art, just its the unusual-and-the-familiar
is the basic source-material of art; it is the vehicle of our
delight, but not its final cause. One might as well confuse the
idea of a journey to a given place with the automobile or the
roads which are the means of going thither. Yet students of
the comic have largely made just this confusion between the
comic spirit of a play and the laws or conventions of comedy,
the spoken play itself.
They are perhaps to justified in part by the paradox
that the conventions of comedy and tragedy (unlike the con
ventions of fiction) are decreed by the subjective or the ob
jective quality of the spirits they are representing. Tragedy,
dealing primarily with the individual and the struggles of the
spirit, is simple and stark; its situations are limited to those
in which the dignity of the chief character is enough to war
rant our sympathy; it may have little physical action—in fact
we resent the intrigue with which seventeenth century "trag
edies" were cluttered by authors all too anxious to please; and
since the familiar in tragedy is subdued below the awful,
conscious and complete verisimilitude is not necessary. Com
edy, on the other hand, requires almost the opposite of all
these elements, with the inevitable difficulty, to be faced at
once, that its social quality multiplies the number of conven
tions used, and once more creates confusion. Comedy deals
less with the individual than with a situation in which all the
characters of the play show forth the normal aspects of society
and the various ridiculous deviations from it; since it does
deal with the notions of society as the audience conceives
them, the situation may concern any groups, actions, and
places whatever, so long as the audience knows them to be
the general middle range of its own normal social existence- —
family life, for instance, is recognizable anywhere; it may
have little action, as in the comedies of wit, or—as in the
greater number of cases by far—it may depend more upon
hilarious actions than upon words alone, and in broad comedy
can serve the comic spirit well by pantomime exclusively. A
great deal of enjoyment in comedy is caused by the physical.
This contrast of tragic and comic conventions so far, may
seem to imply that the comic conventions are virtually un
limited and unchecked, but such is far from the case. As Ihc
accentuation of the social and the objective which underlies
all these conventions implies, the last general requirement of
comedy checks all the others: comedy can express its social
critical spirit only through familiar scenes and relationships,
and verisimilitude is required by the audience for ease in un
derstanding the chief point at issue. It is without doubt this
factor, so inevitable and general, added to the fact that much
of comic performance is frankly physical, that has brought
many moderns to believe that the comic and the realistic are
largely the same thing. Yet the briefest survey of comedies
shows how far from tile truth this view actually is.
iv
If realism were the foundation of the comic spirit, then
those plays adhering most closely to the actual habits peculiar
to their own day, or to the manners of a particular caste,
would he and remain the best comedies for that reason alone;
they do not. The comedies of Aristophanes, of Ben Jonson,
of the Restoration gentlemen, are good comedies in spite of
the fact that they need copious notes to explain their topical
allusions, rather than because of it. When we have become
sufficiently familiar with the life and times they represent,
when notes are no longer needed, the true use of realism in
comedy appears: the jests cause laughter through the short
hand of allusion, the play seems to run a hundred times faster,
so that the whole sparkles with entertainment, and we rush
ahead to the point of each scene and to the final purpose
of the play with a sense of breezy lightness. Hut that is all.

reasonable social state of mind thus instinctively commenting
upon the deviations from it—really a feeling of delighted
superiority—in which the satisfaction of the comic consists.
ii
In answer to this defense of the older distinctions, there
arc innumerable arguments in favor of the sympathy of hu
mor. What of our pleasure in Tom Sawyer?—in I lie suburban
American types of Booth Tarkington?—in the better comic
strips such as Tuthill's Bungle and Fontaine Fox's Tooner
villc? What of the success of Sinclair Lewis' satiric novels?
Is not the delight we derive from these things a matter of
sympathetic recognition rather than of critical sense? I think
not. We see ourselves and our best-known neighbors in these
works, and the recognition causes pleasure, but this is only
an exaggeration of the element of familiarity necessary lo all
artistic effort; it is not the cause of laughter, of comic appre
ciation. The familiarity or recognition required for all ex
pression is, it is true, accentuated in comic material for the
very reason that it deals with the point of view of society, and
hence portrays the social order best known to the audience
whom the artist wishes lo amuse; but the true cause of the
laughter is Ihe ability to be aloof, to criticize.
This statement covers not only places and castes, but lime,
and even moods. A mature man regards familiar scenes of
American childhood with delight, beyond doubt, but even
more with the eye of an observer; and his amusement arises
largely because he is no longer the rascal or Ihe sufferer that
he was in his 'leens. The point is made especially clear by
Booth Tarkinglon's Seventeen, in which many episodes of
painfully recognizable difficulties occur; to the chief character
they are painful, and we may remember how painful analo
gous incidents in our own lives were, but in spite of that
sympathetic feeling, we laugh, because we now realize that
these things were errors, follies, or exaggerations, outside the
normal play of life in general. In like manner, we may re
member our experiences as dwellers in suburbs, in small
towns, in apartment houses, and recognize the peculiarities
and absurdities which accompany such experiences with
pleasure; but our mirth arises from the fact that we see these
familiar things from the point of view of society at its peace
ful norm, which is undisturbed by pettiness, bickering, and
ridiculous pretenses. Even though we still dwell on Main
Street in Suburbia, and recognize the episodes as matters
which surround us every day, we are removed in mood at least
lo flic attitude of a more normally sophisticated society.
Otherwise we do not enjoy the work in question at all. Proof
iu point is Ihe writing of Sinclair Lewis, the department called
Americana in the "American Mercury," the whole cllort ol the
"New Yorker" to poke fun at the provincialism of sophisti
cates theinsleves. In short, the comic spirit demands that we
look occasionally even upon ourselves as absurd specimens
deviating from Ihe serenity of the ideal standard.
Mr. Max Eastman indicates a leaning toward the belief
that Ihe comic is a matter of sympathies rather than observ
ant criticism, by adducing the example ol a baby laughing
delightedly at a watch dangled before it, or at sight ol another
baby. This is no more Ihe spirit of Ihe comic or of humor
than is the sudden laughter which often accompanies embar
rassment; it is no more related to comedy than the scream
with which nervous persons greet Ihe cry |{<)(>, can be related
lo tragedy. If is merely Ihe vocalized rellcx of 1 lie purely
physical sensation.
11 r
But if I he re has been confusion in dealing with Ihe broad
comic spirit itself, there has been confusion worse confounded
in the consideration of its cliiel expression, comedy, where er
rors somewhat resembling this one ol Mr. Eastman are com
mon. The first and most necessary distinction here is thai com
edy is not precisely the same thing as the comic spirit, though
by our smiling I can sec we think so. No definite form can be

the same thing as the spirit which animates it: the spirit is
always both broader and sharper, and the form is always
limited by the very effort to give the spirit concrete expression
—entangled by the necessity to attract and please. The author
must clothe his idea in terms which an audience may under
stand—.which means that he must deal in conventions which
he and they have agreed upon (not very consciously always);
and he must not only see that they are familiar enough, to
make his idea clear, but fresh and vivid enough to entertain.
This is the craft of art, just its the unusual-and-the-familiar
is the basic source-material of art; it is the vehicle of our
delight, but not its final cause. One might as well confuse the
idea of a journey to a given place with the automobile or the
roads which are the means of going thither. Yet students of
the comic have largely made just this confusion between the
comic spirit of a play and the laws or conventions of comedy,
the spoken play itself.
They are perhaps to justified in part by the paradox
that the conventions of comedy and tragedy (unlike the con
ventions of fiction) are decreed by the subjective or the ob
jective quality of the spirits they are representing. Tragedy,
dealing primarily with the individual and the struggles of the
spirit, is simple and stark; its situations are limited to those
in which the dignity of the chief character is enough to war
rant our sympathy; it may have little physical action—in fact
we resent the intrigue with which seventeenth century "trag
edies" were cluttered by authors all too anxious to please; and
since the familiar in tragedy is subdued below the awful,
conscious and complete verisimilitude is not necessary. Com
edy, on the other hand, requires almost the opposite of all
these elements, with the inevitable difficulty, to be faced at
once, that its social quality multiplies the number of conven
tions used, and once more creates confusion. Comedy deals
less with the individual than with a situation in which all the
characters of the play show forth the normal aspects of society
and the various ridiculous deviations from it; since it does
deal with the notions of society as the audience conceives
them, the situation may concern any groups, actions, and
places whatever, so long as the audience knows them to be
the general middle range of its own normal social existence- —
family life, for instance, is recognizable anywhere; it may
have little action, as in the comedies of wit, or—as in the
greater number of cases by far—it may depend more upon
hilarious actions than upon words alone, and in broad comedy
can serve the comic spirit well by pantomime exclusively. A
great deal of enjoyment in comedy is caused by the physical.
This contrast of tragic and comic conventions so far, may
seem to imply that the comic conventions are virtually un
limited and unchecked, but such is far from the case. As Ihc
accentuation of the social and the objective which underlies
all these conventions implies, the last general requirement of
comedy checks all the others: comedy can express its social
critical spirit only through familiar scenes and relationships,
and verisimilitude is required by the audience for ease in un
derstanding the chief point at issue. It is without doubt this
factor, so inevitable and general, added to the fact that much
of comic performance is frankly physical, that has brought
many moderns to believe that the comic and the realistic are
largely the same thing. Yet the briefest survey of comedies
shows how far from tile truth this view actually is.
iv
If realism were the foundation of the comic spirit, then
those plays adhering most closely to the actual habits peculiar
to their own day, or to the manners of a particular caste,
would he and remain the best comedies for that reason alone;
they do not. The comedies of Aristophanes, of Ben Jonson,
of the Restoration gentlemen, are good comedies in spite of
the fact that they need copious notes to explain their topical
allusions, rather than because of it. When we have become
sufficiently familiar with the life and times they represent,
when notes are no longer needed, the true use of realism in
comedy appears: the jests cause laughter through the short
hand of allusion, the play seems to run a hundred times faster,
so that the whole sparkles with entertainment, and we rush
ahead to the point of each scene and to the final purpose
of the play with a sense of breezy lightness. Hut that is all.
The physical imitation of reality which occupies so much of
comedy is useful in the same way—a lumbering walk pre
pares us for the entire character of the clumsy countryman,
who will misunderstand everything and overset whole situ
ations from his ignorance of town customs; a wink, a turn of
the hand, a resolute swing of the foot, speak volumes. In all
of this, the real is not the comic, or even all of comedy; it is
the hand-maid of these things, and to elevate it to the level
of the mistress spirit is to marry the serving maid to the
prince while the true princess is left to watch the geese and
cry upon Kalada.
The matter of speed, lo which I have just alluded brielly,
is another of the.conventions peculiar lo dramatic composi
tion, which I have reserved lo a treatment, by itsell because
!of its somewhat involved character. It is obvious that the
dramatist must feel the limitations o! time as no other artist
need (| ( ,—even O'Neill and Shaw must bend their stiff necks
lo admit the necessity of restricting their actions lo a unified
and something like reasonable space ol time, il they are to
hold the attention of an audience. The playwright's tale must
he made clear, ils action must be represented by living per
sons in action, and his comic or tragic quality must be solidPv
j established, within limitations so sharp that it we were not
| accustomed to the convention by the usage ol centuries, we
should gasp at the rigor of the demand. Many minor conven
tions assist Ihe artist in effecting his tragic or comic quality
in the brief period of presentation: he makes his choice ac
cording to the results desired, between gloomy settings, sunny
ones, or imitations of actual scenes, between poetry and prose,
between the extended line and colloquial brevity; but without,
I think, being quite aware of il himself, he depends chiefly on
his instinctive sense of rhythm to produce the correct con
junction between his subject mailer and ils rale of progress.
(It is for this reason, of course, that the best playwrights have
always been men of Ihe theatre, either actors or constant
spectators, who have become imbued with the drama by ear.)
I know not whether any critic has dealt with the two chief
, forms ol drama in terms of their rhythm of progress; I have
seen no such discussion, and it is not odd, since we have only
lately paid to the matter of rhythmic effects the attention we
should. Instead, we have discussed drama in terms of plot,
character-reaction, atmosphere, quality, and so forth, without
noticing that in some dramas of the most convincing quality
we are obviously not held by any of these things separately
or together, but by a certain something which transcends
them, and which we call lamely "tragic effect" or "comic ef
fect." There is, of course, nothing so vague in existence. Con
sider plays so familiar as Twelfth Night or Hamlet: the plots
arc ragged, attenuated, and hackneyed, and the characters are
so widely varied from magnificent to ridiculous as to preclude
any solid effect from them as a group; the poetic line has
nothing to do with the dramatic effect as a whole; yet nobody
can deny that Twelfth Night is thoroughly in the comic mood,
or that Hamlet rises above a very bloody situation to a won
derfully unified exaltation of tragic impression. To say that
we 1 eel the comic effect or tragic effect is merely to state our
own responses, not to give a name to that singular force which
keeps each play progressing in its proper tone. We are actu
ally talking about the rhythm of performance, the underlying
music ol emotional ebb and flow which is the most direct
expression of the mood in which the author has chosen to
write and affect us. Many persons prefer to call it develop
ment or suspense, but both of these terms are far too narrow.
As one might expect from the opposed natures of the
tragic and the comic, their rhythms are sharply distinguished
from each other. In tragedy the rhythm is invariably delib
erate, even slow, but inevitable—a series of forward surges
to an end which we know we must see, retarded by our inner
unwillingness to approach that end; our chief interest is the
suffering protagonist, and it is our sympathy with him, our
resentment at the situation around him, which produces this
hanging back. (If a serious play be too rapid, we know by
instinct that it is not true tragedy; and without exception it
always is melodrama.) In comedy, on the other hand, we may
know what the end is to be and we may not, but in either
case, undeterred by any concentrated sympathy, and inter
ested in the situation, or a group of individuals, rather than
in one individual, we follow with zest a rhythm of perform
ance which urges ahead in a series of eager leaps, briskly
accompanying author and actors to the point where the clown
will be kicked, the fool displayed, the hypocrite unmasked,
the shrew tamed. We hope for the end as in tragedy we dread
it, and we are content to sit through the delay of this final
critical satisfaction because the author of good comedy knows
how to make his rhythm an increasingly exciting tide of tilil
lations and checks.
I use these somewhat physical terms advisedly, for—as
the emphasis I have allowed to pantomime might suggest—
the methods of comedy arc basically an appeal to almost
physical satisfactions. It is just here that the deepest differ
ence between comedy (the form) and the comic (the spirit)
can he seen. From the shortest vaudeville turn or rough farce,
up through the most refined satire or comedy of manners, it
may be truly said that the rhythm of performance is closely
analogous to the paroxysm of a gusty sneeze. We swing for
ward with increasing sensations of coming pleasure from
the first exposition of situation: comic hint—hesitation
further hint—hesitation—development we 'can almost fore
see—hesitation (the checks becoming shorter as the situation
rushes faster) —trembling moment of ma<t uncertainty
kksou'tion & satisfaction in an explosion of stored-up laugh
ter. Uncertainly and repetition are the fundamental ingre
dients of this snuff-box. The steps in the progress may be all
different from each other in high comedy, but for the most
part in all degrees of the art, the rush to satisfaction is but
repetition of one idea delicately varied; our increasing famil
iarity with it renders the variations more amusing and the
suspense more exciting, and provides in fact part of the pleas
ure in the final resolution —we suspected it all along, and we
are half relieved and half triumphant to see it arrive.
«
VI
In this eager flight to the critical point of the scene or the !
whole play, there is a muscular enjoyment of laughter so great ;
that it is no wonder the unthinking (—and Dryden!) ascribe
to it the whole delight of the comic; there is a domination of j
our milieu and its standards so pervasive that it is perhaps !
only too natural for the uncritical to assume its mere appear-1
a nee in settings, dialect, gesture, allusion, to be the essential !
comic. Moreover, there is the strong sense of experience
shared, existing among audience, actors, and unseen author,
which—even more directly than in tragic performances
gives us a sense of social existence which many persons term
sympathy. But the comic spirit resides in none of these
things, which arc really matters of comedy-method. To make !
the point clear, one has but to mention the maypole dance,
which includes all of these pleasing effects —hilarity, famil
iarity, common experience—and which is yet far from being

imy approach to the comic spirit. No; the essential comic is
the satisfaction in the critical point which is made by comedy
action, from examples such as clever Valentine overcome by
cleverer Angelica down to the kicking of the greater fool by
the lesser. It exists even at its crudest, not for action per so,
but in the words of Vanbrugh, to hold before each man
... a glass,
And show him of what species he's an ass'.
The geniality arising from a comic performance, which
makes strangers smile at each other as they leave the theatre,
may be social sympathy in a sense, but it is not the modern
sentimental sense oli tender kindness for our brother. It is
rather an admission that in tlie play we found an understand
ing of our standards and our follies, and that Puck's im
mortal comment upon mortals was a sound one. Comedy thus
leads to understanding and tolerance—but so does all art;
that is not the specific aim of the comic. The "social sym
pathy" immediately provoked by it comes from group soli
darity aroused to consciousness by critical play. Between the
animated gusto of sympathy such as that, and the tremuloufc
yearning of modern comedy-writers from the eighteenth cen
tury to the Barries (Sir .lames and Master Philip), there is
fixed a gulf of deep and all too unseen tides.
To add one more discussion lo the long list jiow extant J
concerning comedy and the comic spirit seems not so much j
a last straw as it is a waste of time; my only justification in
writing this paper is that I do not attempt a new definition of]
comedy nor add any further complexities, but that by pointing
out certain disregarded distinctions in the definitions already j
known, I hope to clarify somewhat the entanglement which
in these days prevails. The chief difficulty facing any modern
who attempts to discover precisely what comedy and the
comic may be, is the vagueness which surrounds these terms
and the plays written on the basis of that vagueness. In part,
the haziness of critics and writers is the result of an amiable j
wish to regard as comic everything which is not downright j
sad; in part it springs from a tendency to sentimentalize hu
mor, after the romantic fashion begun in the eighteenth cen
tury; in part it is sheer confusion of the elements of the
comic spirit with the methods of comedy (two differing
things). In general, the fashion is to assert that the chief j
source and the aim of the comic is sympathy.
It is necessary to begin making distinctions concerning |
comedy in the definition of the comic spirit itself, and with ]
the best will in the world to be original and modern, I still
must accept the observations of Aristotle and his followers
as the better definition: the comic shows men in their oll
moments as less than normally dignified and serene, and thus
indirectly criticizes their follies. If we allow 100 great an
accent upon sympathy to enter the comic, we not only blur
the outlines of comedy, but take away a primary element from
the sister-form of tragedy. Upon the general basis which sup
ports both forms —the unusual events which are sufficiently
removed from ordinary living lo be worth treating in art —
and with the understanding of civilized standards of living
which is inherent in both, it is tragedy which remains sym
pathetic because ils whole purpose and accent is individual
and subjective; comedy is primarily social and objective. 1
regret that the simplest illustration must he the time-worn
analogy of the worthy citizen falling llat with suddenness in
the street.
There we have ordinary life, universally recognizable, but
willi enough of the unusual to make a crude basis for art.
Some persons see Ihe action as unusual-and-humiliating—
these are the tragic spirits; some see it as unusual-and-incon
gruous—these are the comic spirits. The serious man thinks
of the matter in terms of himself, or of an individual who
can suffer as he himself has done; he either remembers how
much he was hurt by such a fall at one time, or sensitively
imagines how much he would he hurt by one; he admits that
such episodes are part of the common lot, and bows to the
laws of gravitation, but from his sympathetic point of view
he dreads the necessity of the admission while he makes if.
(It is this exercise of emotion struggling wtih reason which
provides the catharsis of tragedy.) The humorous man thinks
in terms of men and their ways rather distinctly of himself;
he accepts the necessary laws of life and conduct as good
things because they are, as far as anyone knows, a safe, sen-'
sible, comfortable —and inescapable- order, and he remains
amusedly aloof from those who break that order. 11 is the
reasonable social state of mind thus instinctively commenting
upon the deviations from it—really a feeling of delighted
superiority—in which the satisfaction of the comic consists.
ii
In answer to this defense of the older distinctions, there
arc innumerable arguments in favor of the sympathy of hu
mor. What of our pleasure in Tom Sawyer?—in I lie suburban
American types of Booth Tarkington?—in the better comic
strips such as Tuthill's Bungle and Fontaine Fox's Tooner
villc? What of the success of Sinclair Lewis' satiric novels?
Is not the delight we derive from these things a matter of
sympathetic recognition rather than of critical sense? I think
not. We see ourselves and our best-known neighbors in these
works, and the recognition causes pleasure, but this is only
an exaggeration of the element of familiarity necessary lo all
artistic effort; it is not the cause of laughter, of comic appre
ciation. The familiarity or recognition required for all ex
pression is, it is true, accentuated in comic material for the
very reason that it deals with the point of view of society, and
hence portrays the social order best known to the audience
whom the artist wishes lo amuse; but the true cause of the
laughter is Ihe ability to be aloof, to criticize.
This statement covers not only places and castes, but lime,
and even moods. A mature man regards familiar scenes of
American childhood with delight, beyond doubt, but even
more with the eye of an observer; and his amusement arises
largely because he is no longer the rascal or Ihe sufferer that
he was in his 'leens. The point is made especially clear by
Booth Tarkinglon's Seventeen, in which many episodes of
painfully recognizable difficulties occur; to the chief character
they are painful, and we may remember how painful analo
gous incidents in our own lives were, but in spite of that
sympathetic feeling, we laugh, because we now realize that
these things were errors, follies, or exaggerations, outside the
normal play of life in general. In like manner, we may re
member our experiences as dwellers in suburbs, in small
towns, in apartment houses, and recognize the peculiarities
and absurdities which accompany such experiences with
pleasure; but our mirth arises from the fact that we see these
familiar things from the point of view of society at its peace
ful norm, which is undisturbed by pettiness, bickering, and
ridiculous pretenses. Even though we still dwell on Main
Street in Suburbia, and recognize the episodes as matters
which surround us every day, we are removed in mood at least
lo flic attitude of a more normally sophisticated society.
Otherwise we do not enjoy the work in question at all. Proof
iu point is Ihe writing of Sinclair Lewis, the department called
Americana in the "American Mercury," the whole cllort ol the
"New Yorker" to poke fun at the provincialism of sophisti
cates theinsleves. In short, the comic spirit demands that we
look occasionally even upon ourselves as absurd specimens
deviating from Ihe serenity of the ideal standard.
Mr. Max Eastman indicates a leaning toward the belief
that Ihe comic is a matter of sympathies rather than observ
ant criticism, by adducing the example ol a baby laughing
delightedly at a watch dangled before it, or at sight ol another

physical sensation.
11 r
But if I he re has been confusion in dealing with Ihe broad
comic spirit itself, there has been confusion worse confounded
in the consideration of its cliiel expression, comedy, where er
rors somewhat resembling this one ol Mr. Eastman are com
mon. The first and most necessary distinction here is thai com
edy is not precisely the same thing as the comic spirit, though
by our smiling I can sec we think so. No definite form can be

the same thing as the spirit which animates it: the spirit is
always both broader and sharper, and the form is always
limited by the very effort to give the spirit concrete expression
—entangled by the necessity to attract and please. The author
must clothe his idea in terms which an audience may under
stand—.which means that he must deal in conventions which
he and they have agreed upon (not very consciously always);
and he must not only see that they are familiar enough, to
make his idea clear, but fresh and vivid enough to entertain.
This is the craft of art, just its the unusual-and-the-familiar
is the basic source-material of art; it is the vehicle of our
delight, but not its final cause. One might as well confuse the
idea of a journey to a given place with the automobile or the
roads which are the means of going thither. Yet students of
the comic have largely made just this confusion between the
comic spirit of a play and the laws or conventions of comedy,
the spoken play itself.
They are perhaps to justified in part by the paradox
that the conventions of comedy and tragedy (unlike the con
ventions of fiction) are decreed by the subjective or the ob
jective quality of the spirits they are representing. Tragedy,
dealing primarily with the individual and the struggles of the
spirit, is simple and stark; its situations are limited to those
in which the dignity of the chief character is enough to war
rant our sympathy; it may have little physical action—in fact
we resent the intrigue with which seventeenth century "trag
edies" were cluttered by authors all too anxious to please; and
since the familiar in tragedy is subdued below the awful,
conscious and complete verisimilitude is not necessary. Com
edy, on the other hand, requires almost the opposite of all
these elements, with the inevitable difficulty, to be faced at
once, that its social quality multiplies the number of conven
tions used, and once more creates confusion. Comedy deals
less with the individual than with a situation in which all the
characters of the play show forth the normal aspects of society
and the various ridiculous deviations from it; since it does
deal with the notions of society as the audience conceives
them, the situation may concern any groups, actions, and
places whatever, so long as the audience knows them to be
the general middle range of its own normal social existence- —
family life, for instance, is recognizable anywhere; it may
have little action, as in the comedies of wit, or—as in the
greater number of cases by far—it may depend more upon
hilarious actions than upon words alone, and in broad comedy
can serve the comic spirit well by pantomime exclusively. A
great deal of enjoyment in comedy is caused by the physical.
This contrast of tragic and comic conventions so far, may
seem to imply that the comic conventions are virtually un
limited and unchecked, but such is far from the case. As Ihc
accentuation of the social and the objective which underlies
all these conventions implies, the last general requirement of
comedy checks all the others: comedy can express its social
critical spirit only through familiar scenes and relationships,
and verisimilitude is required by the audience for ease in un
derstanding the chief point at issue. It is without doubt this
factor, so inevitable and general, added to the fact that much
of comic performance is frankly physical, that has brought
many moderns to believe that the comic and the realistic are
largely the same thing. Yet the briefest survey of comedies
shows how far from tile truth this view actually is.
iv
If realism were the foundation of the comic spirit, then
those plays adhering most closely to the actual habits peculiar
to their own day, or to the manners of a particular caste,
would he and remain the best comedies for that reason alone;
they do not. The comedies of Aristophanes, of Ben Jonson,
of the Restoration gentlemen, are good comedies in spite of
the fact that they need copious notes to explain their topical
allusions, rather than because of it. When we have become
sufficiently familiar with the life and times they represent,
when notes are no longer needed, the true use of realism in
comedy appears: the jests cause laughter through the short
hand of allusion, the play seems to run a hundred times faster,
so that the whole sparkles with entertainment, and we rush

the shrew tamed. We hope for the end as in tragedy we dread
it, and we are content to sit through the delay of this final
critical satisfaction because the author of good comedy knows
how to make his rhythm an increasingly exciting tide of tilil
lations and checks.
I use these somewhat physical terms advisedly, for—as
the emphasis I have allowed to pantomime might suggest—
the methods of comedy arc basically an appeal to almost
physical satisfactions. It is just here that the deepest differ
ence between comedy (the form) and the comic (the spirit)
can he seen. From the shortest vaudeville turn or rough farce,
up through the most refined satire or comedy of manners, it
may be truly said that the rhythm of performance is closely
analogous to the paroxysm of a gusty sneeze. We swing for
ward with increasing sensations of coming pleasure from
the first exposition of situation: comic hint—hesitation
further hint—hesitation—development we 'can almost fore
see—hesitation (the checks becoming shorter as the situation
rushes faster) —trembling moment of ma<t uncertainty
kksou'tion & satisfaction in an explosion of stored-up laugh
ter. Uncertainly and repetition are the fundamental ingre
dients of this snuff-box. The steps in the progress may be all
different from each other in high comedy, but for the most
part in all degrees of the art, the rush to satisfaction is but
repetition of one idea delicately varied; our increasing famil
iarity with it renders the variations more amusing and the
suspense more exciting, and provides in fact part of the pleas
ure in the final resolution —we suspected it all along, and we
are half relieved and half triumphant to see it arrive.

In this eager flight to the critical point of the scene or the !
whole play, there is a muscular enjoyment of laughter so great ;
that it is no wonder the unthinking (—and Dryden!) ascribe
to it the whole delight of the comic; there is a domination of j
our milieu and its standards so pervasive that it is perhaps !
only too natural for the uncritical to assume its mere appear-1
a nee in settings, dialect, gesture, allusion, to be the essential !
comic. Moreover, there is the strong sense of experience
shared, existing among audience, actors, and unseen author,
which—even more directly than in tragic performances
gives us a sense of social existence which many persons term
sympathy. But the comic spirit resides in none of these
things, which arc really matters of comedy-method. To make !
the point clear, one has but to mention the maypole dance,
which includes all of these pleasing effects —hilarity, famil
iarity, common experience—and which is yet far from being

imy approach to the comic spirit. No; the essential comic is
the satisfaction in the critical point which is made by comedy
action, from examples such as clever Valentine overcome by
cleverer Angelica down to the kicking of the greater fool by
the lesser. It exists even at its crudest, not for action per so,
but in the words of Vanbrugh, to hold before each man
... a glass,
And show him of what species he's an ass'.
The geniality arising from a comic performance, which
makes strangers smile at each other as they leave the theatre,
may be social sympathy in a sense, but it is not the modern
sentimental sense oli tender kindness for our brother. It is
rather an admission that in tlie play we found an understand
ing of our standards and our follies, and that Puck's im
mortal comment upon mortals was a sound one. Comedy thus
leads to understanding and tolerance—but so does all art;
that is not the specific aim of the comic. The "social sym
pathy" immediately provoked by it comes from group soli
darity aroused to consciousness by critical play. Between the
animated gusto of sympathy such as that, and the tremuloufc
yearning of modern comedy-writers from the eighteenth cen
tury to the Barries (Sir .lames and Master Philip), there is
fixed a gulf of deep and all too unseen tides.
