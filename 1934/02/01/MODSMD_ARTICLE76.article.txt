.... aiul Bill drove over in the truck. It was a lucky thing
that he came back. The dog had gone oil' somewhere just
about the time that Neal milks, and she didn't get back until
eleven o'clock, which is quite unusual for her. She made a
little "wool !" at the front door, and what a sight greeted us!
Her face was one mass of porcupine quills. She didn't make
a bit of fuss, but went and lay down on her blanket in the
hall. Bill and Elsa had gone to bed. Bill was dead tired from
his trip to Riverside, but I called him. He said that the quills
would have to come out right away, that they would work in,
and that if they didn't come out, they would fester. They
were all around her eyes; 1 don't see how she escaped getting
them in. They were in her moulh, jaws, and nostrils.
We pulled twenty-live, but it hurt her so much that we
couldn't hold her, and she threw her head so that we were
likely to get llie quills in us. Bill said to me, "Mother, the
only thing to do is to chloroform her." So he drove in to town.
He had to wake Wall Gerson up, bid he finally gol I he* chloro
form. First we tried putting it on cotton and covering her
head with a bath towel, but she fought it, so that it did no
good. Then Bill suggested that we get 111* trunk from the
attic, put her in there with her blanket under her, and pour
the chloroform in. We did that, and what a hideous noise she
made! She bunted her head against the sides of the trunk;
we had to sit on to]) of it to hold it down. Katharine and 1
were both crying. We were afraid that she would smother or
would get an overdose of the anaesthetic, and we knew that
she was pounding those quills in further.
After some time, Bill opened the trunk. She was quiet, and
the three of us pulled out thirty-five. Then she began to come
to. We had the trunk out on the front porch, and so we went
into the hall, for we didn't know what her reaction would be
when she came to herself. We watched her through the glass
in the door. She was (pule normal again, but she was batting
away at her face with her paws. The chloroform was gone
and we had just started the job; we realized that it was too
hig a one for us, and so Bill said that we would take her in
to the veterinary at Oroville. I went with him.
We made the twenty miles in about half an hour, and
you know the road is still under construction a good share of
the way. We had to get Dr. Fay outv>f bed. Bill lifted Freya
from the car to the table in the dog's hospital, and Dr. Fay
gave her a hypodermic. He said that it would take six men to
hold her to give her the chloroform, if he didn't get her pretty
well unconscious first. We waited. And waited. And it didn't
affect her a bit. Then he gave her another hypodermic. And
still another. Then he said, "What kind of a brain have you,
dog? That is enough to finish any three dogs." Still she didn't
go under. Every time that lie would pull a quill, she would
throw herself, so that it really look more strength than Bill
had to handle her. Then he gave her a can and a half of ether.
She finally settled down some, and he asked me if I thought
I could hold the ether can near her nose while he pulled. 1
don't like the smell of ether, and Bill doesn't either. But 1
think we were both so anxious that we didn't notice the smell
as much as we would have ordinarily, although I did have to
go outside several times. The veterinary pulled out about
one hundred and seventy. It was three-thirty in the morning
when we got home. We couldn't drive very fast, for the doctor
told Bill to keep shaking Freya up. She might go to sleep and
not wake up, for she had had an awful dose. He told us not
to go to bed until she was fully awake.
When 1 let her out in the morning, she couldn't use her
legs at all. She went down the steps and out on the lawn
with much the same motion that a seal has. I went into the
house to gel my clothes on, but I thought 1 would look out
the window to sec what she was doing. She was just going
down the bank in front of the house toward the river. 1 was
scared still". 1 thought if she gol into the river, sbe would
never get out.
I don't know how I got into my clothes,* but when I got
lo the river, she was sprawled in the water, all but her hind
quarters. 1 suppose she was feverish and wanted to cool her
self oil'. I dragged her out of the water and up the bank, and
by that lime Bill came to help me. We brought her into the
house.
All day Monday she couldn't use her hind logs. When she
walked, she dragged them. Her head wobbled from side to
»side, and her front legs would cross now and then. Bill
thought that perhaps we should lake her back to the hospital.
He phoned the doctor, and the doctor said thai he thought that
she wasn't really out from under the anesthetic yet. So we
decided lo wait. She didn't seem lo have improved by late
afternoon. She couldn't gel down the steps alone, and once
when she tried to come up, she fell backwards on her head.
Katharine phoned Dr. Fay again. If we had to lake her over,
we wanted to do it before night. He said we might expect her
to act quccrly for two or three days, that il was not an unusual
thing. She was very sick to her stomach Monday night, but
Tuesday she began to improve. Yesterday she was belter, and
today she is quite like herself. I only hope Ihe old porcupine
has got out of the way. Larry Brown's pup was with Freya,
but Lady had only six quills. . . .
