Gertrude Stein first began tu write in the early 1 S>Uo's at a
time when she had diseovercd the beauty of Pablo Picasso's
paintings and was often with lliin. For Picasso the end of
painting was not anecdote, or the exact representation of ob
jects, but the achieving of an object, that is a composition
which would give the peculiar satisfaction proper to painting.
Ideally, a painting for him was the equivalent of a complex
experience, realized by the distribution of line and color, hav
ing nothing to do with any meanings outside its surface and
usually involving distortion of forms.
Gertrude Stein began to feel, as others of her period, that
the analysis of feeling and thought, the attempt to present the
reality of human experience by descriptive narrative, plot and
story, had become false, that the literary forms of previous
times no longer said what the awareness of life in her time
made it imperative to say. She began to develop her own style,
or to let it develop. After Three Lives and The Making of
Americans, intelligibility, so-called, disappeared from her
work until the recent appearance of the Autobiography of
Alice 11. Toklas.
The only explanation of Gertrude Stein's style of any im
portance is her own discussion called Composition as li.ipla
nation. In this article she speaks of her growing awareness of
a continuous present: ". . . that in the long history of how
everyone acted or had fell (and) that nothing inside of them
in all of them makes it connectedly different." This implies
her doubt of story as such, which is a connected, separate rela
tion of lives in the past or purely literary present.
In such a so-called novel as Lucy Church Amiably there
is no left-to-righl movement along a connected thread of ac
tion as we have been acustomcd to ex)>eet from narrative, nor
is there grafiimar as we have learned it. In How to Write she
has said: "The question is if you have a vocabulary have you
any need of grammar except for explanation that is the ques
tion, communication and direction and intuition that is the
question." There is, therefore, no explanation in this book.
There is communication, direction, and intuition. Stein is
unable to advance beyond the ultimate questionableness of!
any present moment of being, as logically or grammatically J
anything to be resumed under a logical purity or impurity of j
term and remain in such simplification, real.
ii
Grammar, description, in literary languages, but not in our
thought or spoken language, proceeds by linking words in a
connection which in the end yields up the meaning "chain" —j
that is, its significance as a connection; this meaning we then
apply to the object, event, action or thought described. This!
is grammar's function of communication as intelligible ex-j
planation. II we suspend the ready simplifier and practical'
illusion builder, of reasonable words in reasonable order, that
we may come nearer the representation in words of any pres
ent moment of being, what have we left? The perseverance
of mental action piling up its names to mean itself entirely,
being a description of the process of awareness, remains. This
awareness depends on elements of sensation and spontaneous
action of thought, by and through an attraction complex as a
constant chemical reaction between words, with their conno
tative and denotative values. Stein has learned to use this
with great art.
If we overcome our natural indolence and curb our impa
tience at the disappointment we feel, missing the development!
of a connected sentence or narrative, and take Stein's sen
tences as equivalents, agreeing to their suggestion, offering
more attention and active participation than we are accus
tomed to give, then the peculiar pleasure of her poetry and
humor begins to be more accessible.
If one feels pleasure in evocation of the sensations which
we are constantly experiencing, from the quality of the air,
the lime, the character of humans, the appearance of things,
the pleasure of words as signs of things and in themselves,
the shock of their arrangement in unexpected combinations,
one can find all this in Stein. Together with this pleasure
there is satisfaction of the faculty of knowing in recognition
of an amazing intuition, precise statements of the quality of
experience, the seizing of character, humor, and the curious
general deductions and conclusions which the mind reaches
in the complexity of its momentary awareness rather than in
pursuing a train of analytic thought.
The object of this procedure is to create an experience
which enters the memory in the manner of real experience,
leaving no trace of form, not recoverable, remaining as a part
of growth or history. Its value is a discovery that is known
as lived, not measured, but an impulsion, a renewal of joy,
a play of the mind for its own sake, in the realization of
freedom in ils own world. II is in this sense that Stein may
be said to succeed in an impossible desire: to make her narra
tive the narrative of each one us he reads it, not onlv todav,
* *- V '
but Wednesday, next month, or next year.
Gertrude Stein's lack of a defined form in narrative, or of
apparent structure, is not to be la ken as a lack of direction.
She uses definite means to a definite end. Her description is
from within, and she proceeds by suggestion and association.
By expert balancing she achieves her effects, combining words
for their associations those elaborate internal relationships,
felt rather than known using words for their sound, rhythm,
momentum. Often she lias no other intention, apparently,
than the shaking-up and rearrangement of words to give sur
prise, sharpness, emphasis, and identity to individual words,
questioning them by repetition, unfolding them, turning them
out like accordions. She questions words for sound in con
trast to meaning, and in their combinations, and under this
criticism they are renewed.
The prevailing quality of Gertrude Stein's "unintelligible"
works is humor. This is an objectivity which is a release from
sentiment and question, from drama and melodrama, from
the factitious and the pathetic. This humor is constant and
various, includes wit of technique, and satire as if occurs in
t 'sefut Knowledge.
Stein lias probably had much the same object in writing
as she does, as Picasso had in painting as he did: to give the
peculiar joy of a composition in paint or in words. Kven their
technical problems take the same terms. 15ut there is time in
literature, it not in painting, even when the realization of the
actual has been narrowed down to the present. ". . . even if
there is no time at all in the composition there must be time
in the composition which is in its (/uatity of distribution and
equilibration."

Gertrude Stein's lack of a defined form in narrative, or of
apparent structure, is not to be la ken as a lack of direction.
She uses definite means to a definite end. Her description is
from within, and she proceeds by suggestion and association.
By expert balancing she achieves her effects, combining words
for their associations those elaborate internal relationships,
felt rather than known using words for their sound, rhythm,
momentum. Often she lias no other intention, apparently,
than the shaking-up and rearrangement of words to give sur
prise, sharpness, emphasis, and identity to individual words,
questioning them by repetition, unfolding them, turning them
out like accordions. She questions words for sound in con
trast to meaning, and in their combinations, and under this
criticism they are renewed.
The prevailing quality of Gertrude Stein's "unintelligible"
works is humor. This is an objectivity which is a release from
sentiment and question, from drama and melodrama, from
the factitious and the pathetic. This humor is constant and
various, includes wit of technique, and satire as if occurs in
t 'sefut Knowledge.
Stein lias probably had much the same object in writing
as she does, as Picasso had in painting as he did: to give the

Gertrude Stein first began tu write in the early 1 S>Uo's at a
time when she had diseovercd the beauty of Pablo Picasso's
paintings and was often with lliin. For Picasso the end of
painting was not anecdote, or the exact representation of ob
jects, but the achieving of an object, that is a composition
which would give the peculiar satisfaction proper to painting.
Ideally, a painting for him was the equivalent of a complex
experience, realized by the distribution of line and color, hav
ing nothing to do with any meanings outside its surface and
usually involving distortion of forms.
Gertrude Stein began to feel, as others of her period, that
the analysis of feeling and thought, the attempt to present the
reality of human experience by descriptive narrative, plot and
story, had become false, that the literary forms of previous
times no longer said what the awareness of life in her time
made it imperative to say. She began to develop her own style,
or to let it develop. After Three Lives and The Making of
Americans, intelligibility, so-called, disappeared from her
work until the recent appearance of the Autobiography of
Alice 11. Toklas.
The only explanation of Gertrude Stein's style of any im
portance is her own discussion called Composition as li.ipla
nation. In this article she speaks of her growing awareness of
a continuous present: ". . . that in the long history of how
everyone acted or had fell (and) that nothing inside of them
in all of them makes it connectedly different." This implies
her doubt of story as such, which is a connected, separate rela
tion of lives in the past or purely literary present.
In such a so-called novel as Lucy Church Amiably there
is no left-to-righl movement along a connected thread of ac
tion as we have been acustomcd to ex)>eet from narrative, nor
is there grafiimar as we have learned it. In How to Write she
has said: "The question is if you have a vocabulary have you
any need of grammar except for explanation that is the ques
tion, communication and direction and intuition that is the
question." There is, therefore, no explanation in this book.
There is communication, direction, and intuition. Stein is
unable to advance beyond the ultimate questionableness of!
any present moment of being, as logically or grammatically J
anything to be resumed under a logical purity or impurity of j
term and remain in such simplification, real.
ii
Grammar, description, in literary languages, but not in our
thought or spoken language, proceeds by linking words in a
connection which in the end yields up the meaning "chain" —j
that is, its significance as a connection; this meaning we then
apply to the object, event, action or thought described. This!
is grammar's function of communication as intelligible ex-j
planation. II we suspend the ready simplifier and practical'
illusion builder, of reasonable words in reasonable order, that
we may come nearer the representation in words of any pres
ent moment of being, what have we left? The perseverance
of mental action piling up its names to mean itself entirely,
being a description of the process of awareness, remains. This
awareness depends on elements of sensation and spontaneous
action of thought, by and through an attraction complex as a
constant chemical reaction between words, with their conno
tative and denotative values. Stein has learned to use this
with great art.
If we overcome our natural indolence and curb our impa
tience at the disappointment we feel, missing the development!
of a connected sentence or narrative, and take Stein's sen
tences as equivalents, agreeing to their suggestion, offering
more attention and active participation than we are accus
tomed to give, then the peculiar pleasure of her poetry and
humor begins to be more accessible.
If one feels pleasure in evocation of the sensations which
we are constantly experiencing, from the quality of the air,
the lime, the character of humans, the appearance of things,
the pleasure of words as signs of things and in themselves,
the shock of their arrangement in unexpected combinations,
one can find all this in Stein. Together with this pleasure
there is satisfaction of the faculty of knowing in recognition
of an amazing intuition, precise statements of the quality of
experience, the seizing of character, humor, and the curious
general deductions and conclusions which the mind reaches
in the complexity of its momentary awareness rather than in
pursuing a train of analytic thought.
The object of this procedure is to create an experience
which enters the memory in the manner of real experience,
leaving no trace of form, not recoverable, remaining as a part
of growth or history. Its value is a discovery that is known
as lived, not measured, but an impulsion, a renewal of joy,
a play of the mind for its own sake, in the realization of
freedom in ils own world. II is in this sense that Stein may
be said to succeed in an impossible desire: to make her narra
tive the narrative of each one us he reads it, not onlv todav,

illusion builder, of reasonable words in reasonable order, that
we may come nearer the representation in words of any pres
ent moment of being, what have we left? The perseverance
of mental action piling up its names to mean itself entirely,
being a description of the process of awareness, remains. This
awareness depends on elements of sensation and spontaneous
action of thought, by and through an attraction complex as a
constant chemical reaction between words, with their conno
tative and denotative values. Stein has learned to use this
with great art.
If we overcome our natural indolence and curb our impa
tience at the disappointment we feel, missing the development!
of a connected sentence or narrative, and take Stein's sen
tences as equivalents, agreeing to their suggestion, offering
more attention and active participation than we are accus
tomed to give, then the peculiar pleasure of her poetry and
humor begins to be more accessible.
If one feels pleasure in evocation of the sensations which
we are constantly experiencing, from the quality of the air,
the lime, the character of humans, the appearance of things,
the pleasure of words as signs of things and in themselves,
the shock of their arrangement in unexpected combinations,
one can find all this in Stein. Together with this pleasure
there is satisfaction of the faculty of knowing in recognition
of an amazing intuition, precise statements of the quality of
experience, the seizing of character, humor, and the curious
general deductions and conclusions which the mind reaches
in the complexity of its momentary awareness rather than in
pursuing a train of analytic thought.
The object of this procedure is to create an experience
which enters the memory in the manner of real experience,
leaving no trace of form, not recoverable, remaining as a part
of growth or history. Its value is a discovery that is known
as lived, not measured, but an impulsion, a renewal of joy,
a play of the mind for its own sake, in the realization of
freedom in ils own world. II is in this sense that Stein may
be said to succeed in an impossible desire: to make her narra
tive the narrative of each one us he reads it, not onlv todav,

but Wednesday, next month, or next year.
Gertrude Stein's lack of a defined form in narrative, or of
apparent structure, is not to be la ken as a lack of direction.
She uses definite means to a definite end. Her description is
from within, and she proceeds by suggestion and association.
By expert balancing she achieves her effects, combining words
for their associations those elaborate internal relationships,
felt rather than known using words for their sound, rhythm,
momentum. Often she lias no other intention, apparently,
than the shaking-up and rearrangement of words to give sur
prise, sharpness, emphasis, and identity to individual words,
questioning them by repetition, unfolding them, turning them
out like accordions. She questions words for sound in con
trast to meaning, and in their combinations, and under this
criticism they are renewed.
The prevailing quality of Gertrude Stein's "unintelligible"
works is humor. This is an objectivity which is a release from
sentiment and question, from drama and melodrama, from
the factitious and the pathetic. This humor is constant and
various, includes wit of technique, and satire as if occurs in
t 'sefut Knowledge.

Gertrude Stein first began tu write in the early 1 S>Uo's at a
time when she had diseovercd the beauty of Pablo Picasso's
paintings and was often with lliin. For Picasso the end of
painting was not anecdote, or the exact representation of ob
jects, but the achieving of an object, that is a composition
which would give the peculiar satisfaction proper to painting.
Ideally, a painting for him was the equivalent of a complex
experience, realized by the distribution of line and color, hav
ing nothing to do with any meanings outside its surface and
usually involving distortion of forms.
Gertrude Stein began to feel, as others of her period, that
the analysis of feeling and thought, the attempt to present the
reality of human experience by descriptive narrative, plot and
story, had become false, that the literary forms of previous
times no longer said what the awareness of life in her time
made it imperative to say. She began to develop her own style,
or to let it develop. After Three Lives and The Making of
Americans, intelligibility, so-called, disappeared from her
work until the recent appearance of the Autobiography of
Alice 11. Toklas.
The only explanation of Gertrude Stein's style of any im
portance is her own discussion called Composition as li.ipla
nation. In this article she speaks of her growing awareness of
a continuous present: ". . . that in the long history of how
everyone acted or had fell (and) that nothing inside of them
in all of them makes it connectedly different." This implies
her doubt of story as such, which is a connected, separate rela
tion of lives in the past or purely literary present.
In such a so-called novel as Lucy Church Amiably there
is no left-to-righl movement along a connected thread of ac
tion as we have been acustomcd to ex)>eet from narrative, nor
is there grafiimar as we have learned it. In How to Write she
has said: "The question is if you have a vocabulary have you
any need of grammar except for explanation that is the ques
tion, communication and direction and intuition that is the
question." There is, therefore, no explanation in this book.
There is communication, direction, and intuition. Stein is
unable to advance beyond the ultimate questionableness of!
any present moment of being, as logically or grammatically J
anything to be resumed under a logical purity or impurity of j
term and remain in such simplification, real.
ii
Grammar, description, in literary languages, but not in our
thought or spoken language, proceeds by linking words in a
connection which in the end yields up the meaning "chain" —j
that is, its significance as a connection; this meaning we then
apply to the object, event, action or thought described. This!
is grammar's function of communication as intelligible ex-j
planation. II we suspend the ready simplifier and practical'
illusion builder, of reasonable words in reasonable order, that
we may come nearer the representation in words of any pres

the analysis of feeling and thought, the attempt to present the
reality of human experience by descriptive narrative, plot and
story, had become false, that the literary forms of previous
times no longer said what the awareness of life in her time
made it imperative to say. She began to develop her own style,
or to let it develop. After Three Lives and The Making of
Americans, intelligibility, so-called, disappeared from her
work until the recent appearance of the Autobiography of
Alice 11. Toklas.
The only explanation of Gertrude Stein's style of any im
portance is her own discussion called Composition as li.ipla
nation. In this article she speaks of her growing awareness of
a continuous present: ". . . that in the long history of how
everyone acted or had fell (and) that nothing inside of them
in all of them makes it connectedly different." This implies
her doubt of story as such, which is a connected, separate rela
tion of lives in the past or purely literary present.
In such a so-called novel as Lucy Church Amiably there
is no left-to-righl movement along a connected thread of ac
tion as we have been acustomcd to ex)>eet from narrative, nor
is there grafiimar as we have learned it. In How to Write she
has said: "The question is if you have a vocabulary have you
any need of grammar except for explanation that is the ques
tion, communication and direction and intuition that is the
question." There is, therefore, no explanation in this book.
There is communication, direction, and intuition. Stein is
unable to advance beyond the ultimate questionableness of!
any present moment of being, as logically or grammatically J
anything to be resumed under a logical purity or impurity of j
term and remain in such simplification, real.

Grammar, description, in literary languages, but not in our
thought or spoken language, proceeds by linking words in a
connection which in the end yields up the meaning "chain" —j
that is, its significance as a connection; this meaning we then
apply to the object, event, action or thought described. This!
is grammar's function of communication as intelligible ex-j
planation. II we suspend the ready simplifier and practical'
illusion builder, of reasonable words in reasonable order, that
we may come nearer the representation in words of any pres
ent moment of being, what have we left? The perseverance
of mental action piling up its names to mean itself entirely,
being a description of the process of awareness, remains. This
awareness depends on elements of sensation and spontaneous
action of thought, by and through an attraction complex as a
constant chemical reaction between words, with their conno
tative and denotative values. Stein has learned to use this
with great art.
If we overcome our natural indolence and curb our impa
tience at the disappointment we feel, missing the development!
of a connected sentence or narrative, and take Stein's sen
tences as equivalents, agreeing to their suggestion, offering
more attention and active participation than we are accus
tomed to give, then the peculiar pleasure of her poetry and
humor begins to be more accessible.
If one feels pleasure in evocation of the sensations which
we are constantly experiencing, from the quality of the air,
the lime, the character of humans, the appearance of things,
the pleasure of words as signs of things and in themselves,
the shock of their arrangement in unexpected combinations,
one can find all this in Stein. Together with this pleasure
there is satisfaction of the faculty of knowing in recognition
of an amazing intuition, precise statements of the quality of
experience, the seizing of character, humor, and the curious
general deductions and conclusions which the mind reaches
in the complexity of its momentary awareness rather than in
pursuing a train of analytic thought.
The object of this procedure is to create an experience
which enters the memory in the manner of real experience,
leaving no trace of form, not recoverable, remaining as a part
of growth or history. Its value is a discovery that is known
as lived, not measured, but an impulsion, a renewal of joy,
a play of the mind for its own sake, in the realization of
freedom in ils own world. II is in this sense that Stein may
be said to succeed in an impossible desire: to make her narra
tive the narrative of each one us he reads it, not onlv todav,
* *- V '
but Wednesday, next month, or next year.
Gertrude Stein's lack of a defined form in narrative, or of
apparent structure, is not to be la ken as a lack of direction.
She uses definite means to a definite end. Her description is
from within, and she proceeds by suggestion and association.
By expert balancing she achieves her effects, combining words
for their associations those elaborate internal relationships,
felt rather than known using words for their sound, rhythm,
momentum. Often she lias no other intention, apparently,
than the shaking-up and rearrangement of words to give sur
prise, sharpness, emphasis, and identity to individual words,
questioning them by repetition, unfolding them, turning them
out like accordions. She questions words for sound in con
trast to meaning, and in their combinations, and under this
criticism they are renewed.
The prevailing quality of Gertrude Stein's "unintelligible"
works is humor. This is an objectivity which is a release from
sentiment and question, from drama and melodrama, from
the factitious and the pathetic. This humor is constant and
various, includes wit of technique, and satire as if occurs in
t 'sefut Knowledge.
Stein lias probably had much the same object in writing
as she does, as Picasso had in painting as he did: to give the
peculiar joy of a composition in paint or in words. Kven their
technical problems take the same terms. 15ut there is time in
literature, it not in painting, even when the realization of the
actual has been narrowed down to the present. ". . . even if
there is no time at all in the composition there must be time
in the composition which is in its (/uatity of distribution and
equilibration."
