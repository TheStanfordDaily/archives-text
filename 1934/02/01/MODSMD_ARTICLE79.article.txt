lie mule, my lips: 1 shall not utter speech
To those with ears too dull to understand.
Be still, my hands: 'tis useless to beseech
The things old stupid Fortune never planned.

To those who offer only stares of stone.
Be quiet, heart: there'll be no circumstance
To bring a comrade. You must break alone.
