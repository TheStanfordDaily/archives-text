Thai the inell'ably genteel M. Maurice Havel should he con
sidered by supposedly intelligent critics of music to be the
greatest living composer (with the possible exception of Stra
vinsky) is an aberration of intellect diflicult to comprehend.
II is even the more startling when one considers the neglect
this implies for the work of that undeniably great musician,
Jean Sibelius, whose powerful, disturbing, but civilized music
is too little known in both Europe and Anleriea.
The cream-pull' arpeggios of Havel, likewise, have always
been greeted with much enthusiasm by the general public: a
fact which may have determined the approval of critics. Hut
Paul Hoseneld has even gone so far as to say that Havel is
superior to his teacher, Debussy, from whom he has stolen
everything but his own particular attitudes. Debussy is, of
course, for us of today very /in <le ,siecle, outmoded, very laven
der and old lace; but at the same lime his invention, bis tact,
and the poetry of his music which is in a measure akin to the
verse of Arthur Symons, is much above the tepid perfumes of
his pupil.
Havel has no food in his basket that is even as substantial
as the crusts of poetry; there are, if anything at all, merely
scraps of luminous milk-toast. Debussy was capable of ex
pressing elusive moods, even if they were not the results of
profound emotions. Hut with Havel such moods lack honesty;
he dabbles in fillips and furbelows as though painting empty
China dolls. If Debussy may be compared to Arthur Symons
(and many may doubt Hit', veracity of such a comparison),
Havel might well be compared to Carl Van Vechten.
Havel has enriched the eccentricities of orchestration along
the lines which Debussy and Richard Strauss innovated, but
the results mean little —even less than those of his two fore
runners. For Havel is more interested in the "effects" used
iiusaying something rather than in really saying anything at
al" He attempts unusual gestures, but at the same time they
are always well-bred, fastidious, and superficial. And I do not
think that his popularity with the public necessarily evolves
from the comprehensibility of his pattern accepted as such,
but rather that its precious "effects" have fooled people into
the belief that they arc comprehending a composition which
is complex and "ultra-modern." Havel is Haltering the public
into mistaking manner for material, and doing it with music
that is as obvious as Liszt's Muzcppu.
ii
Whatever Debussy's faults may have been (and much el'
his music is trash), he was at least in his best work capable
of rhythmic variety and of melodic invention. Unfortunately
M. Havel has neither. In the arrangement of what might
laughably be called a rhythmic structure, he relies either upon
llaccid clusters of notes or—as in La Vul.se—upon heavy ac
centuation unto monotony. His melodies, likewise, are so
thin as to be non-existent, or else they are borrowed from
other music. Most of his exceedingly elementary homophonic
construction is based upon pretty variations of the chord of
the major ninth. And one would certainly hesitate to call a
melody that vulgar cabaret tune which forms the redundant
expansion of the liolero.
The bubbling water and the tinseled mythology which
form Havel's programmatic material are admirably suited to
his meaningless methods. It is sterile musical stuff, fearful
of any ideas which might demand broad strokes on a large
canvas. The best things Havel has done are orchestrations of
other composers' works; his vapid intellect is more at ease
when dressing up the ideas of others than when attempting
designs of his own. There has seldom been a composer of
similar unoriginalily and emptiness to attain an eminence
of equal solemnity. Hut the recent Alborudo <lcl (Urucioso
should not fool you long; listen to it carefully a number of
times and its banality will be as painful to you as the insistent
dactyls of Edgar Allan Poe.
That symphony orchestras should play this music widely
so that il is well-known and acclaimed does not refute the
quick oblivion for which it is headed. A wider appreciation
of the truly artistic, brilliant, and subtle China figures of
Prokofieff would indicate a more discriminating intelligence.

been greeted with much enthusiasm by the general public: a
fact which may have determined the approval of critics. Hut
Paul Hoseneld has even gone so far as to say that Havel is
superior to his teacher, Debussy, from whom he has stolen
everything but his own particular attitudes. Debussy is, of
course, for us of today very /in <le ,siecle, outmoded, very laven
der and old lace; but at the same lime his invention, bis tact,
and the poetry of his music which is in a measure akin to the
verse of Arthur Symons, is much above the tepid perfumes of
his pupil.
Havel has no food in his basket that is even as substantial
as the crusts of poetry; there are, if anything at all, merely
scraps of luminous milk-toast. Debussy was capable of ex
pressing elusive moods, even if they were not the results of
profound emotions. Hut with Havel such moods lack honesty;
he dabbles in fillips and furbelows as though painting empty
China dolls. If Debussy may be compared to Arthur Symons
(and many may doubt Hit', veracity of such a comparison),
Havel might well be compared to Carl Van Vechten.
Havel has enriched the eccentricities of orchestration along
the lines which Debussy and Richard Strauss innovated, but
the results mean little —even less than those of his two fore
runners. For Havel is more interested in the "effects" used
iiusaying something rather than in really saying anything at

are always well-bred, fastidious, and superficial. And I do not
think that his popularity with the public necessarily evolves
from the comprehensibility of his pattern accepted as such,
but rather that its precious "effects" have fooled people into
the belief that they arc comprehending a composition which
is complex and "ultra-modern." Havel is Haltering the public
into mistaking manner for material, and doing it with music
that is as obvious as Liszt's Muzcppu.

Whatever Debussy's faults may have been (and much el'
his music is trash), he was at least in his best work capable
of rhythmic variety and of melodic invention. Unfortunately
M. Havel has neither. In the arrangement of what might
laughably be called a rhythmic structure, he relies either upon
llaccid clusters of notes or—as in La Vul.se—upon heavy ac
centuation unto monotony. His melodies, likewise, are so
thin as to be non-existent, or else they are borrowed from
other music. Most of his exceedingly elementary homophonic
construction is based upon pretty variations of the chord of
the major ninth. And one would certainly hesitate to call a
melody that vulgar cabaret tune which forms the redundant
expansion of the liolero.
The bubbling water and the tinseled mythology which
form Havel's programmatic material are admirably suited to
his meaningless methods. It is sterile musical stuff, fearful
of any ideas which might demand broad strokes on a large
canvas. The best things Havel has done are orchestrations of
other composers' works; his vapid intellect is more at ease
when dressing up the ideas of others than when attempting
designs of his own. There has seldom been a composer of
