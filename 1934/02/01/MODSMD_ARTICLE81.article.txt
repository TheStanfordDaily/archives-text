# PHILOSOPHY AND LIFE
## 
### KURT F. REINHARDT 
II philosophy looks for a legitimate place in education, it;
will have to taee the test of life. A philosophy that passes this
tost will be able to appeal to the mind of the educated man
and woman. Its fundamental principles will at least capture
the attention of every person with a sound mental fabric. That
is all that can be expected. And it is :i 11 that is necessary. 11
people become eager to think and to think rightly and cor
rectly, what more could be hoped for?
Is life theVi the criterion of philosophy? It is not. Can
philosophy submit to the demand that all our scientific en
deavors should be subordinated to the values ol life? It caiii
not. "Some people," says Friedrich Schiller, "conceive of sci- 1
encc as an exalted Goddess, and for some people it is an effi
cient cow that must provide them with butter." Truth is the
central conception of philosophy. Therefore, the primary
purpose of philosophy cannot be the furtherance, the height- j
oning, or strengthening of life, be it physical, psychical, in-1
dividual, or social. These results in most cases will be (lie 1
natural fruits of sound philosophical principles, but they
should never become criteria of philosophical truth. To make
fruitfulncss of its doctrines the touchstone of philosophy, ]
means to reverse the genuine relationship of metaphysics and |
ethics, of being and acting. All actions tend toward an end,
and we must lirst establish the end before deciding about the
steps that will be necessary to reach it. II so happens that a
scientist or a philosopher w ho works on some special problem j
and whose fundamental attitude is an unselfish love for truth,
will always have a clearer vision than the restless agitator!
whose main concern it is to wrest from his science the fuel
with which he can set the world on fire. "Mr. Propaganda" l
who is entirely obsessed with an exclusive purpose, usually i
misses the aim and races past his goal, whereas the man who!
has his center of gravity within himself, will be closer toj
reality and will safely arrive at his goal.
In philosophy, everything depends on the point ol' do- 1
parture. If we start on the right track, we shall arrive at the j
right conclusions. If we start on the wrong track, our con
elusions will sooner or later reveal the fallacies of the starting
point. There may be a great deal of good in a philosophical,'
an economic, a political theory—if the underlying philosophi-J
cal principles are the wrong ones, the end can never be right.!
There may be a great deal of evil, graft, and corruption in an J
actual political system—if the philosophical principles em
bodied in the stated constitution are the right ones, everything |
can be readjusted and everything may turn out well.
These considerations are very consequential because of
the fact that we are all philosophers, whether we know it or)
not, whether we want it or not. We accept a certain standard •
of rules with which to play the game of life; we accept a
certain set-up or coherence of facts, and we interpret these i
facts according to our set of rules. We cannot live like the!
brutes on pure instincts, and we cannot exist like the angels;
on pure spirit. If we try to do it in spite of ourselves, we shall 1
first have to manufacture a nice philosophic theory with
which to justify our d/oings. It' the facts do not fit into our]
pel theory, we may press them a little to make them fit. Some-1
times, that scheme seems to work. For a while, anyway. At
any rate, whatever we do, we always base our actions on a
certain philosophy of life.
]Jv our very nature, then, being rational animals, animals
gifted with the power of reasoning and burdened with the
necessity of reasoning, we philosophize. We relied on things
and events, on facts and experiences, on sense data and emo
tions. We try to discover the ultimate causes and principles
of being and acting. Everything, then, depends on the way
we look at things, on the way we interpret facts and cxpe- j
riences. . ( |
There is a right way and there is a wrong way of looking
at things. In fact, there is one right way, and there are a
multitude of wrong ways. Consequently, we should expect
that there is one true philosophy and that there are many
false philosophies. The true philosophy has its roots deeply
in reality. It starts from facts and experiences, it makes use
of our mental faculties of abstraction, it has confidence in our
cognitive operations in general and is convinced that our
mind is ordered and proportioned to reality. Properly oper
ating, therefore, our mental operations will arrive at valid eon
elusions.
This true philosophy has been called the "Permanent Phi
losophy." It is concerned with the changing aspects of the
one and essentially unchangeable truth. Truth is older than
the thirteenth century, and it is newer than the twentieth cen
tury. Truth is an objective value that rests in itselt and, in
its essence, is independent of time and place and independent
of how much or how little of it is cognized.
The twentieth century differs from past centuries in its
general outlook. The greatest philosophers ol the past were
only exponents of a generally accepted belief, endorsed by
public opinion, in a certain standard ol values, in a firmly
established order. They recognized that order in the world
that surrounded I hem, tliev experienced that order within
themselves, and they tried to realize that order in their inter
course with their fellow-men. The whole social organism pre
sented a living testimony of that firmly established order.
Men frequently did not live ii|\ to these ideal standards, but
the ideal standards were endorsed by public opinion. The
majority believed in this hierarchy of values, and they knew
about their own shortcomings.
Today, there is no longer an established order in which
the nations of Europe and the Americas believe or which they

hold in esteem. Turmoil ami eliaos seem to rule supreme in
the various departments of life and civilization. It is this
plight of the present day that forces upon our contemporaries
the genuine philosophical quest. They ask: what shall we
do? In a state of intimidation, this is the first natural question
that presents itself, lint, philosophically speaking, it is not
the lirst legitimate question. And experimentation, being
started on a grand scale, seems to render the tangle more
involved. This question "What shall we do?" can legiti
mately he asked only after we have answered that other (pies
lion: "What are we?" Being precedes action, lleing estab
lishes the basis for action. The principles of our human ac
tions must be based upon the principles of our human being.
In other words, the definition of man decides about what every
man can do, what every man should do and what he shoulfl
not do. Ethics is based on metaphysics. II we want to act in
a human way, we must lirst know what that means: a human
way.
This consideration should make it perfectly clear that it
is more important to balance our minds than it is to balance
our budgets. If we balance our minds and acquire the proper
human habits and virtues', we contribute all that is essential
for the re-establishment of social and economic order.
