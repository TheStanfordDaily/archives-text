# DAVE GATES
## A 						Conclusion 
### Jack Lesley 
t
Dave Cafes was strong. He was long and angular and
tough. He liked to do hard work with his muscles. When he
carried a heavy load on his back he moved with grace and
precision; on the street he shuttled and' looked awkward.
Dave had been in Port Jackson for nine days. He arrived
there on a C&O freight train from Roanoke.
An old man who ran a greasy restaurant down by the
railroad yards in Roanoke let Dave wash dishes for a plateful
of old meat and two boiled potatoes. When Dave finished the
potatoes the old man gave him a piece of apple pie and told
him about the bridge that was being built up the river from
Port Jackson. They worked niggers and anybody who'd work
with 'cm, he said. Nobody cared about the niggers and they
was always gettin' hurt and knocked off the bridge and maybe
he could get a job.
Dave was tired of bumming around so he went to Port
Jackson. He slept in the park at night, and in the morning
he would go down to the dock where the tugs picked up the
men and took them to work. While the men wailed for the
lugs David talked to them and some of them gave him money
for food. On the third day a nigger broke a leg and Dave got
his job.
Now he was living at Mrs. Conway's boarding house and
going to work with the rest of the men. Charlie, one of the
fellows who had given him money, told him about Mrs. Con
way's. Dave liked Charlie, so he went there to live.
The torrid sun glazed the smooth river. Tall pines stood
at the water's edge, their majesty lost in the distance of the
immeasurable Hat lowlands. Their crisp green coolness was
infused with heal; Ihey looked a smoky lavender against the
while horizon.
Dave worked with a gang of men who stripped wooden
forms f rom the dry concrete. They cleaned them, swung them
on a hoist over the edge of the bridge, and lowered them to
a barge on the water sixty feet below. A tugboat towed the
barge lo the head of the bridge where another gang of men
fixed the forms around steel beams that rested on concrete
piles driven into the muddy river bottom by the relentless
thumping of a big driver. Steel workers came with rolls of
wire and bundles of iron bars and put down a network of
reinforcing. Then the huge mixer vomited a stream of slushy
grey concrete through a long nozzled tube into the moulds.
It took three men to hold the nozzle. They wore boots and
stood knee-deep in cement all day long. There was no shade
where they worked, and sometimes one of the men would
faint and have lo be pulled out of the grey slush before lie
suffocated.
Work went on nine hours a day in a wet heat that kept
the skin dripping and clothes soaked. At eleven-thirty a
whistle blew and the men stopped half an hour for lunch.
Then the whistle blew again and they would all go back to
work. The only other time they stopped work was when a
thunderstorm crashed down across the river and ripped the
water into a froth and splashed big holes in the fresh con
crete. Then the boats came out and they all went home.

It was Wednesday. Dave ate his lunch in the shade of a
tarpaulin that had been stretched from a pile of cement sacks
to the girders that were to support the huge draw. Two hours
before, the paymaster had come with a big suitcase. He carried
a pistol and was accompanied by a guard with a iifie. Little
yellow envelopes were stacked in neat and orderly piles in
• the suitcase. The men showed their numbers and each was
i;iven one of the envelopes.
That evening Dave's boat was crowded with joking men.
A bunch of niggers shot craps in the bow. Some lost and won
their pay a dozen times before the lug docked. Dave liked
the niggers but wouldn't roll dice with them. He sat in the
stern and watched the churning wake of the propeller and
smelled the evening air. The sweat dried on his body and his
clothes became sticky.
The boats docked and Dave paid hack two of the men who
had given him moiyy the others wouldn't lake it. That left
him enough to pay Mrs. Conway for his board and room; not
only that, but he could buy some clothes to replace the sticky
ones he wore. lie walked over to Jefferson Avenue and went
into a Navy Store. He bought a pair of white duck trousers
for ninety-eight cents, a shirt for fifty, some socks for ten,
and a pair of shoes for two dollars. He went out of Ihe store
humming a tune the niggers had been singing on the bridge.
He left the main street, and walked past rows of red brick
houses that were sel out close to the sidewalk. He turned
down a shady street where some noisy children were playing
baseball, leaped up se.ven grey-painted wooden steps, and let
Ihe screen d.oor slam behind him. He ran cold water in the
tub that was too short for his long body and left his clothes
in a heap on the floor.
Half an hour later he came down stairs wearing the clean
new clothes he had just bought. He took a magazine from Ihe
polished table in the high narrow parlor and read in the porch
hammock until Mrs. Conway called him to dinner. After
dinner he went back to the hammock with Charlie and talked
until nine o'clock. Then he went up to his squeaky white
enameled iron bed and was asleep the instant he closed his
eyes.
Nobody knew how he fell. When Charlie gol back to Mrs.
Conway's the next night he went into the kitchen and told her
that he was afraid Dave wasn't coming home for dinner. Then
he said that he was sorry but one of the fellows who was help
ing Dave with the forms said he turned around and he wasn't
there. It must have been just at the time he had fallen, the
fellow said, because he heard somebody down on the barge
yell and when he got to the edge of the bridge they were pick
ing him up. Charlie said he must have lit on his head because
he was dead then.

It was Wednesday. Dave ate his lunch in the shade of a
tarpaulin that had been stretched from a pile of cement sacks
to the girders that were to support the huge draw. Two hours
before, the paymaster had come with a big suitcase. He carried
a pistol and was accompanied by a guard with a iifie. Little
yellow envelopes were stacked in neat and orderly piles in
• the suitcase. The men showed their numbers and each was
i;iven one of the envelopes.
That evening Dave's boat was crowded with joking men.
A bunch of niggers shot craps in the bow. Some lost and won
their pay a dozen times before the lug docked. Dave liked
the niggers but wouldn't roll dice with them. He sat in the
stern and watched the churning wake of the propeller and
smelled the evening air. The sweat dried on his body and his
clothes became sticky.
The boats docked and Dave paid hack two of the men who
had given him moiyy the others wouldn't lake it. That left
him enough to pay Mrs. Conway for his board and room; not
only that, but he could buy some clothes to replace the sticky
ones he wore. lie walked over to Jefferson Avenue and went
into a Navy Store. He bought a pair of white duck trousers
for ninety-eight cents, a shirt for fifty, some socks for ten,
and a pair of shoes for two dollars. He went out of Ihe store
humming a tune the niggers had been singing on the bridge.
He left the main street, and walked past rows of red brick
houses that were sel out close to the sidewalk. He turned
down a shady street where some noisy children were playing
baseball, leaped up se.ven grey-painted wooden steps, and let
Ihe screen d.oor slam behind him. He ran cold water in the
tub that was too short for his long body and left his clothes
in a heap on the floor.
Half an hour later he came down stairs wearing the clean
new clothes he had just bought. He took a magazine from Ihe
polished table in the high narrow parlor and read in the porch
hammock until Mrs. Conway called him to dinner. After
dinner he went back to the hammock with Charlie and talked
until nine o'clock. Then he went up to his squeaky white
enameled iron bed and was asleep the instant he closed his
eyes.
Nobody knew how he fell. When Charlie gol back to Mrs.
Conway's the next night he went into the kitchen and told her
that he was afraid Dave wasn't coming home for dinner. Then
he said that he was sorry but one of the fellows who was help
ing Dave with the forms said he turned around and he wasn't
there. It must have been just at the time he had fallen, the
fellow said, because he heard somebody down on the barge
yell and when he got to the edge of the bridge they were pick
ing him up. Charlie said he must have lit on his head because
he was dead then.
t
Dave Cafes was strong. He was long and angular and
tough. He liked to do hard work with his muscles. When he
carried a heavy load on his back he moved with grace and
precision; on the street he shuttled and' looked awkward.
Dave had been in Port Jackson for nine days. He arrived
there on a C&O freight train from Roanoke.
An old man who ran a greasy restaurant down by the
railroad yards in Roanoke let Dave wash dishes for a plateful
of old meat and two boiled potatoes. When Dave finished the
potatoes the old man gave him a piece of apple pie and told
him about the bridge that was being built up the river from
Port Jackson. They worked niggers and anybody who'd work
with 'cm, he said. Nobody cared about the niggers and they
was always gettin' hurt and knocked off the bridge and maybe
he could get a job.
Dave was tired of bumming around so he went to Port
Jackson. He slept in the park at night, and in the morning
he would go down to the dock where the tugs picked up the
men and took them to work. While the men wailed for the
lugs David talked to them and some of them gave him money
for food. On the third day a nigger broke a leg and Dave got
his job.
Now he was living at Mrs. Conway's boarding house and
going to work with the rest of the men. Charlie, one of the
fellows who had given him money, told him about Mrs. Con
way's. Dave liked Charlie, so he went there to live.
The torrid sun glazed the smooth river. Tall pines stood
at the water's edge, their majesty lost in the distance of the
immeasurable Hat lowlands. Their crisp green coolness was
infused with heal; Ihey looked a smoky lavender against the
while horizon.
Dave worked with a gang of men who stripped wooden
forms f rom the dry concrete. They cleaned them, swung them
on a hoist over the edge of the bridge, and lowered them to
a barge on the water sixty feet below. A tugboat towed the
barge lo the head of the bridge where another gang of men
fixed the forms around steel beams that rested on concrete
piles driven into the muddy river bottom by the relentless
thumping of a big driver. Steel workers came with rolls of
wire and bundles of iron bars and put down a network of
reinforcing. Then the huge mixer vomited a stream of slushy
grey concrete through a long nozzled tube into the moulds.
It took three men to hold the nozzle. They wore boots and
stood knee-deep in cement all day long. There was no shade
where they worked, and sometimes one of the men would
faint and have lo be pulled out of the grey slush before lie
suffocated.
Work went on nine hours a day in a wet heat that kept
the skin dripping and clothes soaked. At eleven-thirty a
whistle blew and the men stopped half an hour for lunch.
Then the whistle blew again and they would all go back to
work. The only other time they stopped work was when a
thunderstorm crashed down across the river and ripped the
water into a froth and splashed big holes in the fresh con
crete. Then the boats came out and they all went home.

there on a C&O freight train from Roanoke.
An old man who ran a greasy restaurant down by the
railroad yards in Roanoke let Dave wash dishes for a plateful
of old meat and two boiled potatoes. When Dave finished the
potatoes the old man gave him a piece of apple pie and told
him about the bridge that was being built up the river from
Port Jackson. They worked niggers and anybody who'd work
with 'cm, he said. Nobody cared about the niggers and they
was always gettin' hurt and knocked off the bridge and maybe
he could get a job.
Dave was tired of bumming around so he went to Port
Jackson. He slept in the park at night, and in the morning
he would go down to the dock where the tugs picked up the
men and took them to work. While the men wailed for the
lugs David talked to them and some of them gave him money
for food. On the third day a nigger broke a leg and Dave got
his job.
Now he was living at Mrs. Conway's boarding house and
going to work with the rest of the men. Charlie, one of the
fellows who had given him money, told him about Mrs. Con
way's. Dave liked Charlie, so he went there to live.
The torrid sun glazed the smooth river. Tall pines stood
at the water's edge, their majesty lost in the distance of the
immeasurable Hat lowlands. Their crisp green coolness was
infused with heal; Ihey looked a smoky lavender against the
while horizon.
Dave worked with a gang of men who stripped wooden
forms f rom the dry concrete. They cleaned them, swung them
on a hoist over the edge of the bridge, and lowered them to
a barge on the water sixty feet below. A tugboat towed the
barge lo the head of the bridge where another gang of men
fixed the forms around steel beams that rested on concrete
piles driven into the muddy river bottom by the relentless
thumping of a big driver. Steel workers came with rolls of
wire and bundles of iron bars and put down a network of
reinforcing. Then the huge mixer vomited a stream of slushy
grey concrete through a long nozzled tube into the moulds.
It took three men to hold the nozzle. They wore boots and
stood knee-deep in cement all day long. There was no shade
where they worked, and sometimes one of the men would
faint and have lo be pulled out of the grey slush before lie
suffocated.
Work went on nine hours a day in a wet heat that kept
the skin dripping and clothes soaked. At eleven-thirty a
whistle blew and the men stopped half an hour for lunch.
Then the whistle blew again and they would all go back to
work. The only other time they stopped work was when a
thunderstorm crashed down across the river and ripped the
water into a froth and splashed big holes in the fresh con
crete. Then the boats came out and they all went home.

It was Wednesday. Dave ate his lunch in the shade of a
tarpaulin that had been stretched from a pile of cement sacks
to the girders that were to support the huge draw. Two hours
before, the paymaster had come with a big suitcase. He carried
a pistol and was accompanied by a guard with a iifie. Little
yellow envelopes were stacked in neat and orderly piles in
• the suitcase. The men showed their numbers and each was
i;iven one of the envelopes.
That evening Dave's boat was crowded with joking men.
A bunch of niggers shot craps in the bow. Some lost and won
their pay a dozen times before the lug docked. Dave liked
the niggers but wouldn't roll dice with them. He sat in the
stern and watched the churning wake of the propeller and
smelled the evening air. The sweat dried on his body and his
clothes became sticky.
The boats docked and Dave paid hack two of the men who
had given him moiyy the others wouldn't lake it. That left
him enough to pay Mrs. Conway for his board and room; not
only that, but he could buy some clothes to replace the sticky
ones he wore. lie walked over to Jefferson Avenue and went
into a Navy Store. He bought a pair of white duck trousers
for ninety-eight cents, a shirt for fifty, some socks for ten,
and a pair of shoes for two dollars. He went out of Ihe store
humming a tune the niggers had been singing on the bridge.
He left the main street, and walked past rows of red brick
houses that were sel out close to the sidewalk. He turned
down a shady street where some noisy children were playing
baseball, leaped up se.ven grey-painted wooden steps, and let
Ihe screen d.oor slam behind him. He ran cold water in the
tub that was too short for his long body and left his clothes
in a heap on the floor.
Half an hour later he came down stairs wearing the clean
new clothes he had just bought. He took a magazine from Ihe
polished table in the high narrow parlor and read in the porch
hammock until Mrs. Conway called him to dinner. After
dinner he went back to the hammock with Charlie and talked
until nine o'clock. Then he went up to his squeaky white
enameled iron bed and was asleep the instant he closed his
eyes.
Nobody knew how he fell. When Charlie gol back to Mrs.
Conway's the next night he went into the kitchen and told her
that he was afraid Dave wasn't coming home for dinner. Then
he said that he was sorry but one of the fellows who was help
ing Dave with the forms said he turned around and he wasn't
there. It must have been just at the time he had fallen, the
fellow said, because he heard somebody down on the barge
yell and when he got to the edge of the bridge they were pick
ing him up. Charlie said he must have lit on his head because
he was dead then.

Dave Cafes was strong. He was long and angular and
tough. He liked to do hard work with his muscles. When he
carried a heavy load on his back he moved with grace and
precision; on the street he shuttled and' looked awkward.
