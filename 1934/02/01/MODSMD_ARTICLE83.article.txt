### CHIYE MORI 
Pitched a crystal instant, the bright top turns
In timet ess motion, humming with the ground.
And swerving neither left nor right it burns
Above the constant point to which it's bound.
The fumbling hand that threw it mars it not,
Xor get the tottering start. The spinning top
I'nwinds the time that is its given lot.
And then, careening, comes to sudden stop.
Although time bound the brief and moving term,
It had no place upon the balanced tip.
It is time's urgencies that shall confirm
The spinning top, the quick the burning lip.
Look! how all beauty and all mortal fame
Pivots oil man's unsubstantial name!]
