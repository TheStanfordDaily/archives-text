# DEMENTIA ECONOMICA
## 
### CORNELIS VAN HASSELT 
Wo liave no lack of critics in America who are offering us
an economic (I stand corrected: Tin: economic) interpreta
tion of literature. Y. F. Calverton is getting to he a veteran in
that school, and the latest recruit, Granville Hicks, has man
aged to attract favorable attention with his "Great Tradition."
A blessing on Karl Marx and till his disciples! Literary knowl
edge is forever getting cluttered up with the dim and dusty
masterpieces of yesterday, with dessicated names of whilom
favorites, with toothless theories and outlooks long sightless.
Any new method is at any rate a challenge. It goes through
our critical lumber room like a devastating housemaid, with
powerful Scandinavian arms and a purpose inscrutable to
man. When the turmoil is over, things may be a little worse
than they were before, but at any rale, they will never be quite
the same again.

So 1 feel a great deal of sympathy for the Economic Inter-
] < preters of Literature. My only objection is that they are not
thorough-going enough. They may tell us that Willa Gather,
Branch Cabell, or Thornton Wilder do not belong to literature,
! and that William Z. Foster is the only American author worth
mentioning: but this will hardly elicij a smile. II they started
seeking the iron law of wages in Homer, the sins of capitalism
in Dante's Inferno, or the lirst adumbration of Leninism in
! Shakespeare, then they would be frankly funny. And Heaven
knows we need fun, with the Depression, like Charles 11, tak
ing "such an unconscionable time in dying."
But the economic interpreters of Literature are only imi
tating, after a couple of generations, the economic interpreters
! of History. If by History we mean what is still taught under
' that name in our best universities the record of man's folly
in the shape of wars, revolutions, persecutions, massacres,
and other epic amenities, then, to the credit of economics he
it said, economies cannot interpret it: economics is far too
sensible to account for these grand sadistic pastimes.
Take two striking historical events,,• as historical as they
i make them, the French Revolution and the Great War. The
French Revolution was started by the enlightened bourgeoi
| sic, which already had wealth, but wanted prestige. The na
; ture of property was not in question: feudalism had long been
dead, and the first llickers of socialism were barely percep
tible. A duke, a financier, a merchant, an artisan, a peasant,
1 all had exactly the same conception of property, the same awe
before its sacred character. If the Revolution strengthened
1 the clhss of peasant proprietors, it was merely as a by-product.
| And this class, the chief benciieiary of the movement, was also
the most tepid in supporting it. Many peasants fought against
! the men who had freed them and opened to them the gate to
! economic independence.
The struggle between France and Germany Iras lillcd the
I unhappy annals of Europe for many a generation. At no time
had that struggle an economic background. The trade be
tween the two neighbors has always been brisk and mutually
profitable. The true rivals for world markets were England
and Germany. Yet they remained friends until about 1900;
the misunderstanding between them was political, not eco
nomic, matters of prestige, not of interests. It was not the
business elements in the two countries that urged them to a
mad rivalry: on the contrary, bankers, merchants, ship-own
ers made vigorous efforts, as late as the spring of 1914, to
avert an un-eeonomic, an anti-economic catastrophe. When
England was on the brink of war, the City was the last to re
sist. The most purely economic school of thought, Manches
i terian Liberalism, consistently stood for peace. War is a lit
j of romanticism: it is the passion, the fierceness, the splendor
of it that fascinate men, who then refuse to count the cost.
Louis XV said: "I am a King, not a merchant"; and Sir Nor
man Angell might echo: "Only Kings—crowned or not—i.e.
the symbols of the picturesque and sentimental in national
life, would wage war; merchants know better."
ii
You may tell me that wars, treaties, revolutions, etc., arc
not History, but mere accidents. History should deal with the
j vast secular trends which affect the daily lives of men. To
be sure: if by history you mean economics, then economics
will explain history. Personally, I prefer the aesthetic inter
pretation: history is a gorgeous and costly pageant in which
men are both actors and spectators. 1 do not much like that
form of art; I do not believe it is worth the treasures and pains
, lavished upon it. But it is art, and men crave it. And its place
can be taken, not by economic satisfaction, but by better art.
What Germany needs at present is a critic to make her feel
that, after all, Hitler is rather obvious.
After denying the economic interpretation of literature
and the economic interpretation of history, why not deny also
the economic interpretation of economics? This is no fanciful
: paradox: for a hundred years, critics have poked fun at Homo
Economicus, that bloodless monster whose sole passion was
, to buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest. Pure
| economic law has never been allowed tree play in the eco
nomic field. Living economics, as distinct from the theoretical
science, is a part of sociology, of collective psychology, of
ethics. The heredity of private property is not a purely eco
nomic concept: it is based on tradition and sentiment. Na
tionalism, which is frankly aesthetic and sentimental, has
constantly interfered with free trade, which is pure economic
orthodoxy. Philanthropic legislation has never been totally
abandoned, even in the heyday of Laissez Faire. The best eco
nomic regime is not the most economical, i.e. the one that will
produce most goods, but the one which will best give men
security combined with sclf-rcspeet. I ltimately, the test is a
moral one: any regime in which I feel humiliated is wrong to
me. Self-respect may be attained in many ways which are not
economic. In feudalism: loyally is a source of pride. In a
theocracy: the beggar, it he be a man of God, may win more
respect than the milfionnaire. In a nationalistic slate: the
servant of the common good ranks highest, irrespective of eco
nomic reward. If Communism and Capitalism are to be com
pared, our criterion will be, not material production, but hu
man values.
