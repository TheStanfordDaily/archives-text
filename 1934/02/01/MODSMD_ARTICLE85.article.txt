The Mother, by Pearl S. Buck. (The John Day Company)
$2.50.
Readers who enjoyed the universality of The (Hood Earth
and the lusty pageantry of Sons will welcome Mrs. Buck's
new novel of China as.a momentous contribution to contem
porary fiction which combines the virtues of both these other
books.
The central character has no name; she needs none for
she is the individualized representative of all mothers. But
Mrs. Buck's "Mother" is not a type; her actions do not form
either a composite or a vague picture; this is perhaps because
of the artistry with which dramatic detail is presented.
"The Mother" rose much earlier, retired much later than
her husband and children. She did the same heavy tasks
ever> day while her husband's trips to neighboring towns
were frequently enlivened by interludes of successful gam
bling. Yet it was he who rebelled against the monotony of
this life which apparently was planned to maintain an even
tenor through birth, love, pain, to death. He seized upon a
convenient opportunity to leave bis wife.
Hers was an indomitable prid.e as weii as an indomitable
courage. She refused to let the villagers know that her hus
band had left her; life went 011 much as before, but without
the occasional solace of adult love. She continued to tend the
fowl and the water buffalo, to work for her two sons—one
eager, the other careful and calculating—and for her hglf
blind daughter; she lived to see the eager, hopeful son meet
a communist's death, the daughter dead after marrying a
moron, the third child return with a wife to drive the mother
from her marriage bed. But life was renewed as partial com
pensation; her son's wife bore him a son.
Once she allowed herself a momentary relaxation; her
pride forced her to destroy the child which would have been
born out of this short pleasure. We see her, finally, satisfied
in the beauty of life, as she holds the tiny body of her living
grandson. •
To say that Mrs. Buck's latest novel is mediocre is to admit
an exceedingly narrow critical circle. In style and in the ex
pression of dignified humanity, The Mother is eminently
worth while.
