ANY WAY
YOU FIGURE
TJp-TO -THE-NECK, in studies
... or head-over-lieels in

time. Toasted flakes of wheat.
Ready to eat. Easy to digest.
Quick to release energy. Just
pour on milk or cream . . .
and dive in!

Satisfyingâ€”not heavy. Won't
interfere with sound sleep.
Get PEP at the campus
lunch or canteen. Always
fresh in the individual pack

in Battle Creek.
