# FEMALE FIGGERS
## 
### 
Sorority Pledge Day at Utah sees
a yearly derby. Some part of the
female anatomy is chosen for judg
ing. All pledges are then measured
or weighed, as the case may be, and
a general average ascertained. The
house whose new additions come
closest to the standard gets a trophy.
