Realistic Settings
Final toucnes on the ambitious
stage settings were completed yes
: terday. An exceptionally realistic
; effect has been produced—ldaho
mountains looming in the back
; ground, glowing fire in a surround-
J ing circle of authentic covered wag
i ons, historically accurate properties,
j the whole enhanced by carefully
: worked out lighting effects.
Costumes continue the high stand
: ard set by the production as a whole,
j The women's costumes, almost with
out exception, have been created es
pecially for the wearer, besides being
replicas of costumes actually worn
j in that period.
Male garb entailed the additional
consideration of vocation of the
character. Attire ranging from that
|of the clergy to the more rude ap
l parel of a '48 blacksmith are de
picted in minute detail.

Sherman McFedries head the large
cast. The former has the benefit of
