# More Money Talk

### 
Money talk, money rumor kept
exchanges buzzing. Uncle Morgen
thau, who says nothing, saying noth
ing. Rumor had it Bank of England
was buying dollars to keep the
pound below live dollars. Whisper
stated France was losing gold stead
ily, would be forced to meet U.S.
and British withdrawal by de-valu
ing her franc. An unbalanced French'
budget responsible for falls of four
cabinets in no time at all and im
plying inflation lent strength to that
whisper. Against its probability
stood Mr. Average Frenchman who
had inflation (more drastic) in the
early twenties and didn't like it.
