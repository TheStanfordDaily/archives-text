"So good you can smell the In
dians," smilingly opined Dean G. B.
Culver at last night's behind-locked
doors dress rehearsal of "Distant
Drums."
University officials luisy during
tonight's production were among
those privileged characters admit
ted to the confincs of the well
guarded Assembly llall.
Mrs. Culver, also present, agreed
with her academic husband regard
ing excellence of setting and the
eerie effectiveness of the much
touted tom-tom rhythms. "Espe
cially Helvenston's sets" they concur.
Gray Praises
Professor Henry Gray, English
Department, committed himself ver
bally as "all for it."
"It is certainly a stirring drama.'
remarked he. "The actors seem to
understand the situation and the
critical events of American history

I being portrayed, and enter into Hum
| spirit of the play with remarkable
j appreciation and understanding." A
rare combination, that of histori-
I cally-minded thespians.
Similar sentiments were expressed
|by Dr. and Mrs. Swain. The one
person disappointed in even a minor
phase of the evening's performance
j was the spouse of the ex-acting
president, and her chagrin was
summed up in one query: "What, no
Indians?"
Best Play
"The best play I've seen at Stan- j
ford," said Walter E. Todd, dramatic!
coach of Menlo School, at an earlier j
rehearsal. Todd's enthusiasm, rating
"Distant Drums" higher than the
many Stanford triumphs of the past,
is not a lone one—last night's typi
cal reaction was that the drama as
a whole showed a first-night polish
seldom encountered in amateur pro
ductions.
