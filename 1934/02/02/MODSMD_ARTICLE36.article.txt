# TROY MOVES ON IOWA
## 
### 
.Many an low,'in has Icl'l his native cornfield lo conic lo
Los Angeles. Thai is nol news. !l is history- one of the
great migrations of the world, comparable with the move
ment of the kangaroos from Asia lo Australia and the gray
squirrels from Xew Kngland lo New York.
lint when two athletes left Ihe I niversity of lowa and
arrived at F. 5.0., tlnil is news. More than news, it is an
incident. II is an incident thai still lies smouldering ready
(o break into flames at anv minute, plunging this great
nation of l.'M) million people into civil war.
Diplomatic negotiations have been opened up but they
are still open. lowa charged proselyting, and in all ath
letics there is no more horrible word. I'.'S.C. was indig
nant; Ihe fair honor of the university had been be
smirched; the stars and balls (basketballs this time) had
been blackened.
While Ihe younger Trojan bloods called for war and an
invasion of lowa, the wiser heads held back. Diplomacy
would be tried first. lowa, burdened with corn, debts, and
AAA experts, swallowed its pride and apologized lo I'.S.C.
Hut the mighty Trojan was nol satisfied. War at any
price, cried the warriors of the South. Millions for Jones
but not one cent for lowa, read the banners. lowa had
apologized but it was not the correct type of apology.
The diplomats have now arived at an impasse. A re
sort to armed force is in the oiling. lowa is beini* iflock
aded on both oceans; and international diplomatic ma
chinery has broken down just another perfect example
thai the League of Nations won't work, and that free
wheeling is the "forgotten mechanism" of 193-1.
At last word, the yellow press was fanning Ihe popu
lace with atrocity tales; and the populace was fanning ilr
sell' in the face to keep cool after listening to orators cry
through the streets, "We have met the enemy, and the
whites of their eyes arc ours."
Frankly, we don't know whether l\S.('. "asked" the
athletes lo "go West," or whether the boys just suffered
from an unhappy home life. Maybe, il was wanderlust
new places, new faces, new people to do we don't know.
But for any big-lime college to make such a fuss over
Iwo athletes seems immensely amusing. Further, it is
alarming. Diplomacy has ruined international affairs and
now, being thwarted by the re-birth of nationalism, has
invaded intercollegiate athletics.
After all, everyone remembers the ('arnegie Report.
