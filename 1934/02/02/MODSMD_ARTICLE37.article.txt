# Roosevelt Bents the Drum
## 
### 
Id the economic field, Roosevelt liiis proven himself to
he a tricky original quarterback. But when il comes to
international a Hairs, he resembles the typical plodding
fullbacks of American political history. Nowhere is this
more evident than in his policy regarding armaments.
Over a hall billion dollars will be spent within the next
few years in Ihe upbuilding o t the American navy. We
all know (hat this is only for defensive purposes; but who
is ready to attack us is not quite so clear.
Mr. Hearst has printed some pictures of dead and
dying in the last war, and from these he deduces the need
for a greater navy. While Mr. Roosevelt's interest in big
navies antedates Mr. Hearst's pictures, the President's na
val beliefs are 011 a like plane.
Being a rich country, we can build our heads off, and
we are. Other nations will attempt to emulate. They prob
ably have not forgotten a lurid chapter in Miss Columbia's
career termed the "Spanish-American War, or Tooting the
Trumpet in Havana." Maybe, they even remember the
time Miss Columbia got mixed up with a Mexican Sugar
Daddy, and nicked him for Texas, California, and a couple
of lesser bits as well. Anyway, Kngland, Japan, France,
and the rest will start duplicating our mad building spree.
The only dilliculty is that whereas we can spend like
fools, and still manage to Jive, the other countries cannot.
Besult: hate, jealousy, bankruptcy.
In armament races, war spirit breeds. A good offense
may be a good defense, but we don't relish being blown to
bits even in a defensive war unless il is absolutely neces
sary. And why make il necessary?
Twenty years ago, Roosevelt was Assistant Secretary
of the Xavy and of course suffered from naval nostalgia.
But he was only a young buck in his thirties then. It is not
100 much to expect him to have outgrown some of his
youthful fancies. We remember when we used to think
sliding down bannisters was the best sport in the world.
