# BULL SESSION
## NUTS! 
### 
If there is any truth at all in that
old horticultural aphorism: 'Big
Oaks from Little Acorns Grow," it
also follows that big nuts from lit
tle nuts do grow, and vice versa. As
the tapering proboscis, the flowing
name, and bulging Adam's apple of
Father William are handed down to
William Jr. according to best Men
delian tradition, so the queer idea;?
and fewer ideals of the moment be
come the still queerer ideas of suc
ceeding years.
Presumably, the benefit of a Stan
for education is that we are pulled
away from mother's apron strings
and father's old silver razor, shoved
into a new atmosphere, and sent
upon our merry way by the sage
council of faster parents in ihe form
of lectures, professors, and Cit in
structors.
We are perhaps dropped off in the
Econ department, where the inter
est of the faculty is in "providing
(he opportunity for the man who is
likely to lie one of the leaders in
the community." That is, and should
be the guiding spirit; because Stan
ford men and women are of the up
per 5 per cent (or better), and if
these little dynamos of potential
leadership absorb the proper volt
age and amperage — undoubtedly
they will enlighten the future.
In this particular section of the J

training school, for instance, let us
take a rapid glance at the "oppor
tunity" which faces the Young
Community Leader. He will learn
that in the stock market only legiti
mate enterprises are accepted. He
will not be faced with the frigid
fact that investors have been bilked
of millions of the coin of the realm
by the flotation of the stock market's
love children.
He will have the further oppor
i (unity of learning lhat speculation
in general serves useful economic
functions, though the text will be
fair enough to point out that there
is some danger through market ma
nipulation.
The Y.C.L. (Young Community
j Leader) will have the distinct op
portunity of learning his facts of
life from books copyrighted in the
I year 1928 —before life as we know
' it really began, before the economic
pole cat had actually gotten under
way.
| So the man seeking his "opportu
nity" will forge ahead, knowing that
one of the biggest evils of specula
tion is ignorance on the part of the
speculator, knowing that he must
not be ignorant if he is to help
"guide new capital into productive
channels." Ignorance; there is the
trouble! Must we not become un
ignorant, Young Community Lead
ers? • —Dave Mellinkoff

In this particular section of the J

training school, for instance, let us
take a rapid glance at the "oppor
tunity" which faces the Young
Community Leader. He will learn
that in the stock market only legiti
mate enterprises are accepted. He
will not be faced with the frigid
fact that investors have been bilked
of millions of the coin of the realm
by the flotation of the stock market's
love children.
He will have the further oppor
i (unity of learning lhat speculation
in general serves useful economic
functions, though the text will be
fair enough to point out that there
is some danger through market ma
nipulation.
The Y.C.L. (Young Community
j Leader) will have the distinct op
portunity of learning his facts of
life from books copyrighted in the
I year 1928 —before life as we know
' it really began, before the economic
pole cat had actually gotten under
way.

nity" will forge ahead, knowing that
one of the biggest evils of specula
tion is ignorance on the part of the
speculator, knowing that he must
not be ignorant if he is to help
"guide new capital into productive
channels." Ignorance; there is the
trouble! Must we not become un
ignorant, Young Community Lead
