# Political Fires
## 
### 
Fist shaking old guards, brawling
x'ammanys, and non conformist states
are getting in the hair of political
bosses in both major parties. A pro
tect-the-American-industry element
in the Republican ranks has risen
and given fiery condemnation of low
ered tariff rates as the machinations
of New York internationalists.
Shades of Hoover hover round the
Mills tariff theory, and plenty of the
old boys in the party are making it
known that they never did approve
of the policy or its hovering shade.
Time has brought no change of heart.
Tiger-trainer Farley is feverishly
cracking political whips in an at
tempt to make the Tammany man
eaters behave, but Ihey refuse to
jump through any hoops.
