MISS I ANE S BABY IS STOLEN
At the Varsity Theatre
| There is only one incident in the
| filmâ€”the rescue of Miss Fane's baby,
i But the locus is so concentrated,
j and the suspense so carefully and
j slowly built, that the picture sur
i passes Night Flight in sheer excite
j ment. This singleness of event is
j hard on one person, Miss Wieck,
| who is forced to display the one
| emotion of agonized waiting for too
I long a time. Delightfully natural in
j her scenes with the baby, but some
; times too consciously posed by an
! art director, her most touching mo
i ments are her attempt to conceal
| the kidnapping from her employer,
1 and her speeches over the radio. At
l times she is forced by the script to
| overemote, as when she runs up to
| embrace her baby's picture on the
cinema screen.
Alice Brady is so fine in her se
i rious scenes that it is a distinct
j shock at the end of the picture to
J see her lapse from a subtly-drawn
i farmer's wife into her stock charac
terization of overdone vapidness.
Her comedy has become so stereo
typed that one forgets she is capa
ble of deft and delicate acting.
Babies Leroy and Spanky are still
! too young to be conceited or con
j sciously cute; therefore they con
! tribute immensely to the film's suc
|
1 cess.
