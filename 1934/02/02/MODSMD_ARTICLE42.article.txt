At the Stanford Theatre
I Moving along with an irregular,
but generally rapid tempo, with oc
casional bright spots of unusual dia
logue and situation, this picture
manages to make itself entertaining
in spite of a trivial plot and super
ficial direction. The really tragic
. plot-situation is transformed into
near farce. A "struggling" artist and
| a young working girl share the same
| attic of a cheap New York apart
, ment house by arrangement of the
I landlord who sees to it that the two
; occupants never meet. They do
I meet (strange), and fall in love
1 (stranger), without realizing that
!they live together in the same room
! (more strange).
The director has handled his
theme very lightly, skipping over
the tragic element and stressing the
'horse-play. The result is a slightly

naive vehicle very much resembling
[ a musical comedy sans music. Laura
Hope Crews, portraying the per
petually inebriated widow and pa
i troness of the arts, is alone worth
the price of admission. George Sid
! ney, as the landlord, manager to
instill sympathy and comedy into
his Scrooge-like role. Norman Foster
is the artist and Ginger Rogers the
| girl. They do as well as possible in
roles which merely call for the repe
tition of farce-lines. If you like
' your movies light, unsophisticated,
' and slightly slap-stick with "dram
mei" reduced to a minimum, this
: one will probably please you.
A1 Pearce and his Radio Gang
(five vocal soloists, a male trio, a
female trio, a couple of pianists,
three comedians and a comedienne,
plus numerous encores) entertained
for several hours. Good voices, good
comics with good old gags—but after
sitting for two hours—good night!
