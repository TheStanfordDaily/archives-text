# Babe Basket Tossers Meet Cal Freshmen
## 
### 
Only that ethereal but ever
■ watchful nemesis of winners, over
confidence, can keep the Card Frosh
quintet from trimming the Cal Year
lings tomorrow night in the first of
two return games, the preliminary to
the battle between the two varsities.
Right that the Golden Bear Cubs
have come a long ways since their
47-17 defeat by the Card Babes two
weeks ago; right that Coach Bill
Higgins has uncovered a sensational
center in Bob Herwig, who has
chalked up 37 points in the last
three games; right that the length
of the Golden Bear lair may take a
lot of fight out of the Papooses, used
to the smaller fourt of their Pavilion
wigwam; but no frosh team in Ihis
area can beat the brand of ball that
Braclshaw's men have been showing
this week.
Cal Cubs Good
Four games have completed the
Cal Cubs schedule since they left
the Farm, growling vengeance after
a 30-point trouncing at the hands of
the Indian first-year men. First was
a 43-17 loss to St. Mary's frosh, fol
lowed by a last-minute 26-23 defeat
by Placer High and a trimming at
the hands of Galileo High.
Early this week the Cal frosh hit
their stride, taking down Poly High
of San Francisco Wednesday night
to the tune of 28-14. Proof that the
Cubs have come up with a rush: by
comparative scores they improved
eight field goals inside of a week.
But this great momentum that the
Berkeley five has attained, and
which they will surely show Satur
day night, does not appear to be
powerful enough to overtake the
head start of the Stanford frosh.
Furthermore, Jimmy Bradshaw's
men have been coming along at no
inconsiderable pace themselves this
past week. Accuracy, in their pass
ing game, which that department
has been entirely lacking in here
tofore, has made the frosh offense
surer, less dependent on the touch
of their shooting forwards.
Better Card Defense
From the Farm, which is a long
j ways from the California gym, the
j Cal yearlings look to have a chance
jto stay in the ball game if their
guards hit the bucket, as Sparks did
two weeks ago. To stop these shots,
the Card forwards may have to come
[out, leaving the high-scoring Her
: wig plenty of room for his tallies
! from the center of the court and fol-
I low-up chances, at which he is par
ticularly adept. But the Cards have
' been coached in an aggressive dc
| fense which should bottle up Her
! wig before the lanky Cub can stow
away the ball game for the Bears.
The starting line-ups: Stanford
frosh—Turner and Quade, forwards;
Beedle, center; Moore and Schott,
l guards. California frosh — Cornell
| and Knight, forwards; Herwig, cen-
I ter; Sparks and Callaghan, guards.
