# WATER POLOMEN TO ATTEMPT TWELFTH LEAGUE WIN AGAINST LAKESIDE TOMORROW
## 
### 
Stanford water poloists will meet
the Lakeside Swimming Club in the
Enema pools at 4:15 o'clock tomorrow
afternoon as they attempt to take
their twelfth straight league victory.
Lakeside, cellar position team in
both varsity and freshman divisions
of the Northern California Water
Polo League, gives little promise of
halting the top place Cardinal squad.
I Stanford has not lost a game since
| formation of the league a year ago.
; The Indians won six straight to cap
! ture the 1933 championship, and they
! have five victories to their credit this
| season.
Regulars Almost Healthy
Colds and other troubles that les
isened Stanford's advantage in last
! week's game with the Athens Club
! are reported as cured this week, and,
! with the exception of Jimmy Triolo,
J the Cardinal first string will be in
; tact. Triolo is still a poison oak vic
i tim and he will not play for several
weeks.
Thornton will use Vlad Taranik,
Jimmy Benet, and Boh Foster to
[start in the forward positions. Paul
! deSilva, who showed well while re
i lieving Foster last week, is due for
! considerable action. Captain Gordy
Graves, Wally Wiget and Bill Wood
i ard will play the guard positions,
| with Jack Marietta doing relief
I work. Lee Cook will appear in the
1 cage for Stanford.
Rough Game Certain
Although Lakeside has not won a
I game as yet, the Oakland squad
; splashed to a 3 to 0 lead before the
Indians began to click aiKl score
i seven straight points to win the first
j game, 7 to 3.
i Led by Captain Gordon Corson,
: former Oregon star who iriter
| cHlmges between forward and guard,
Lakeside offers to be rough.
Stanford's freshman aggregation,
| which showed pitiful weakness on

offense and great potentiality de
fensively, will attempt to show some
scoring fire in the preliminary
against Lakeside's Reserves. They
have devoted this week to work on
their offensive, and they promise a
constant goal bombardment.
, The yearlings will line up as fol
lows: MacKenzie, Hoover, and Voss,
forwards; Harris or Scatena, Peter
son, and Pearson, guards; Haslacher,
goalie.
The frosh game will begin at 3:30
o'clock. The public, including the
feminine portion, is invited to both
games; no admission charge.
