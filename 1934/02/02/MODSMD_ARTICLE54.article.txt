# Wolter Starts Best Baseball Team in Years
## 
### Chuck Clancy 
The best balanced and most prom
, I
ising varsily baseball squad Coach
Harry Wolter has directed in his 11 :
i years here as mentor will swing into |
the 1934 campaign Saturday after- I
| noon at 2:15 o'clock on the Sunken
j diamond when Stanford faces its'
1 first real test against the strong Ath- i
ens Club team of Oakland.
The trans-bay outfit which will
| oppose the Cards is composed of I
j prominent local semi-pro and past
big league performers and is rated
|by Manager Bill Hollander as "a ;
j team superior to any that has repre- i
j sented the c'ub against Stanford in !
' Ihe past."
Anderson on Mound
Wolter has decided to start Stan- :
: ford's most effective battery with j
! Anderson on the mound and Massey i
j doing the receiving. "Gabby" Gal- i
j braith will start at the hotly con- '
j tested shortstop berth, but Clark, ;
i who showed up well Wednesday j
I against San "Jose State at the same ;
j position, will probably see action j
j part of the gpme.
| Edwards, who makes the third of j
, the trio fighting for the position, had i
| several stiches taken in his lip after ;
' stopping a bad hop in infield prac- t
! tice Wednesday. He will probably ;
! be unable to participate.
Athens Players
Some of the outstanding perform
' ers on the Athens Club team are:
| Joe Smith, catcher; Lacione, center- !
I fielder; and Nielsen, shortstop.
Admission will be free.
The Stanford starting lineup:
Trautman or Tremaine, 3b; Nut
!ting, rf; Hamilton. If; Woolley, 2'o;
! Miles, cf; Grayson or Hearn, lb;
! Gi Ibraith, ss; Massey, c; Anderson, p. i
