# Frosh Nine Bats Against High School Tomorrow
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman baseball team,
lacking organization and experience,
will open its 19.'Â«4 season against Mc-
Clymonds High School team from
Oakland on the frosh ball field to
morrow morning at 10 o'clock.
Coach Ernie Nevers is still in the
experimental stage with his team,
and he probably will use several
players in each position.
Albert Brent and Jim Senders,
southpaw pitchers, and Lamson Da

"is. right-hander, ail will see action
on ihe Stanford mound; the catching
post is between Mike Ferro and
Louis Tsoutsouvous. The remainder
of the infield will consist of George
Ferris, first base; Peter Cartwright,
second base; Tom Lanphier, short
stop; and Sheldon Riley or Dick
Bullis, third base. Nevers has not
chosen his outfield.

Washington's Huskies with eight
victories and no defeats have virtu
ally cinched the northern division
basketball title.
