Amateur Convention
The National Theatre Conference
is an organization embracing every
theatre organization outside of the
professional stage. When the pro
fessional theatres attempted to seri
ously curtail and possibly eliminate
little theatre by exorbitant sections
, in the N.K.A. Theatrical Code, this
strong organization saved the life
of the little theatre by concentrating
its power upon Washington.
The Pacific Northwest Division is
composed of all important theatres
East of Colorado, including the Uni
versities of Washington, Oregon,
California, Stanford, Montana, Idaho,
Southern California, and other little
j theatre groups.
