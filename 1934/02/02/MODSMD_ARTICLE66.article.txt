# Byrd Men Safe
## 
### 
A week's fight against the relent
less forces of a crumbling ice front
was won yesterday as the struggling
members of Admiral Byrd's Ant
arctic expedition successfully sue*
ceeded in removing a cache of sup
plies from Pressure Ridge, threat
ened by breaking ice. Following the
completion of the record tying run
of the 60-year-old Bear of Oakland
between Dunedin and the Bay of
Whales, both the Bear and the flag
ship S.S. Jacob Ruppert began dis
charging winter stores.
