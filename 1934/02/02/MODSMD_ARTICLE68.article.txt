# Pious Pope
## 
### 
Pius XIII, Pope, at Rome gave an
interview. Said the bald All-father:
the world is suffering from hyper
nationalism, emphasis on material
ism. Too many youths are getting
military training disguised as ath
letics. Also this sex education is bad.
W. R. Hearst, who calls at the Vati
can now and then, would disagree
on all counts.
