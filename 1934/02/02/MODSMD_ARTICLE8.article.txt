## Card Quintet Prepared To Demolish California's Title Hopes TEAM HAS NO INJURIES Bunn Expects First String To Work Smoothly 
### Chuck Chappell 
Having shoved California into a
tie for the conference lead by their
defeat of S.C. last week, Stanford's
Indians will be all set at 8 o'clock
tomorrow night in Berkeley to back
the favor they granted and topple
the Bears into a tie with the Tro
jans. Or in other words, Stanford
has a good chance to beat California
tomorrow.

While they are in a favorable spot
j to further or hamper sundry oppon
' ents' chances for a title, Coach John
| Bunn and his crew are probably not
! yet willing to concede the cham
: pionship to either the Bears or the
| Trojans.
j Although the three games they
; have lost to U.C.L.A., California, and
| U.S.C., respectively, -are quite a
, handicap to any championship aspi
i rations, the Indians h.ive deraon
] strated that they are capable of beat
| ing any team in the conference.
Whether the pace will be kept up or
i not, will be learned tomorrow night.
Cards in Top Shape
Fully recovered, as they proved
j against S.F.U. Tuesday nii>ht, from
I any injuries they may have had,
| Keith Topping, Arnie Anderson,
I Captain Hal Edelen, Gordy Malla
' tratt, and Charlie Rogers are slated
1 to start against the Bears.
Nibs Price is expected to start the
i same quintet that opened against
Stanford two weeks ago. This will
consist of Captain Hal Eifert and
| "Bones" Coughlan at forwards: Dave
1 Meek at center, and Steve McGaf
frey and Milt Stansky at guards.
Score Uncertain
Although a bevy of comparative
I scores, as well as the last game be
tween the Indians and Bears, are
available for prediction, a basketball
'game is always an uncertain thing
1 to call in advance, particularly with
Eifert, Topping et alia likel> to go
wild at any moment.
Price for Stanford students who
' present A.S.S.U. cards is 40 cents;
