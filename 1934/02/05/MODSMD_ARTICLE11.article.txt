# Setting, Direction Win Inferior Play Praise
## 
### ELIZABETH CHAPIN 
Against a semi-circle of strikingly
realistic pioneer wagons, a cast of
3 veterans and 14 newcomers to the
Stanford stage Friday night enacted
Dan Totheroh's "Distant Drums",
under the direction of Harold Hel
venston.
Helvenston's direction was sur
passed only by his setting, which
was in its way as effective as the
superb second act of last quarter's
"Anns and the Man". But here rea
lity and strength were achieved
through careful attention to detail
and through excellent lighling and
sound effects, as well as through
many fine stage groupings.
Totheroh to Blame
A professional cast could hardly
have done better with the play, and
it is at Totheroh that the criticism
should be leveled. The plot is slen
der; the poetry of some of the lines
is marred by the inevitability of
others and by a frequent tendency
to repetition.
The burden, then, rested on the
shoulders of Helvenston and his cast,
many of whom rose to the occasion.
Outstanding—as she should have
been—was Kay Arthur in the very
difficult role of Eunice Wolfhill.
Here was a character remote from
present-day thought and compre
hension. and Miss Arthur showed
maturity and understanding in her
interpretation. Occasionally uneven
in voice, she was particularly fine in
her pantomine and bodily move
ments.
McFedries 1 Shading Good
Nor did Sherman McFedries have
an easy part in Harris Wolfhill, who
was neither consistent or lovable.
McFedries' work was especially no
table for his shading between pathos
and brutality, and h.'.s was a good,
forceful performance.
The third member of the triangle,
Jason Allcnby, was clearly under
stood by James Benet, unpleasant
though Jason may have been at

[times. And it is distinctly to Benet's
| credit (hat he achieved so consistent
a character, without bidding over-
I much for audience sympathy. His
Jason was not the stock romantic
hero.
Of the lesser players, who served
I largely as background for the story
, of the call the distant drums had for
| Eunice, Shelley Smith and Paul
| Crary were outstanding, the latter
! doing his best work to date as the
i old trapper. Particularly in the first
1 act did he do a sympathetic and
i genuine piece of work.
Hardest Role
If (his seemed a play of difficult
J roles, Miss Smith's was perhaps the
! most difficult—that of the young
mother. She attained sincerity and
, pathos where overacting might h-ive
j been easier.
Rachel Mayhue and William
Gwinn as (he Pikes were good, the
i former with an exceptionally
straighforward performance, and the
! latter evincing fine virility and a
l pleasing voice.
Ronald Kay's Clemens was the
| jarring note of the evening, being
altogether too snivelling and conven-
I lional to convince. Mary Ann
! Wheeler's was a strangely immature
Mr?. Shaw, while Carter Meyer was
very good as her husband.
