# Hall Men to Hold Caucus Tonight in Toyon Lobby
## Probable Choices Unknown as Dorm Residents Meet To Make Nominations for Mid-Year Election 
### 
Ray Wilbur, Jr., former election
board head and political power
among the Hall men, will rap his
gavel tonight at 7:15 o'clock in Toyon
lobby, bringing to order the Hall
caucus which will choose represen
tatives for the various offices open
in the approaching mid-year elec
tion.
Probable candidates remained
shrouded in mystery last night,
but it is generally felt among Hall
men that nominations will be
based on administrative ability
rather than personal popularity.
Indications pointed to a united ap
proval by the Hall men of candidates
who have already been tentatively
selected by the inner coterie who
rule over non-fraternity campus po
litical affairs.
In the other camp—the Row—it

appeared that (he factions which
f-'-plit last spring's caucus wide open
have left the organization weakened
and plans for a pre-election meeting
seem rather remote. Last night none
of the Greek political powers who
were contacted had heard of any
arrangements for such a meeting.
It is generally felt, however, that
certain Row men will run for offices
to be voted on at this election
whether support by ihe fraternities
as a body will be obtained or not.
Chuck Glasgow and Bud Godfrey
! are almost certain candidates for the
I graduate member post open on the
!Ex Committee. Johnny Lyman will
I probably defend his appointed posi
! lion as vice-president of the A.S.S.U.,
| and Bob Grayson may run for the
I vacancy on the Board of Athletic
I Control.
