# GIESEKING WILL PLAY IN RECITAL HERE TOMORROW
## 
### 
Walter Geiseking, hailed as "sor
cerer of the piano" by the European
press, will make his campus debut
tomorrow night at the Pavilion, when
he appears in concert under the
auspices of the Concert Series.
Gieseking was born in Lyons,
France, in 1895, although b}' blood,
training, and temperament he is
German. His father, though eclipsed
by his more celebrated son, whs a
musician of some note, having a
special interest in the flute and
piano
Not Encouraged
At the age of four, the boy chose
the piano as his play-toy, and it re
mained his greatest recreation until
the age of 16. His father, wanting
his son to grow up strong and
healthy, did not encourage him in
the pursuit of an artistic career.
Tickets for Tuesday night's per

cert Series office. Scats for the Rosa
Ponselle recital are also available.
