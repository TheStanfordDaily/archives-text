# BROWN DERBIES AND BLACK CIGARS
## 
### 
The Tovon lobby air will be thick tonight with cigar
smoke and political speeches. The Hall men will be nomi
nating their ticket for Ihe student-body elections that are
due in a week or so. There will be much excitement; and
local ward-heelers will run this way and that rounding up
votes for their "man" Blotto, the while hope from the
vallev.
Already the battle-scarred bosses have prepared their
ticket and are preparing to jam it through. Now, we think
bosses and their political henchmen are very funny things.
They lake themselves so seriously; and take everyone else
for plain fools. Of course, the funniest ones are those that
profess complete freedom from political interest but in
reality are so far in it that thin applesauce flows from
them like drool from Baby Henry, age three.
It is this crowd that are attempting to use the Hall
caucus as a rubber stamp for their own desires.
Now, in the world outside our gates, this is common
practice. But collegians should have too great a sense of
liumor to countenance such applesauce to flow on its
happy way unchecked.
The caucus tonight is open to all men not living in the
fraternities. They should come and join in the fun of
splitting the bosses' pork barrels wide open. The power of
the cliques that try to run the caucus lies in the fact that
so few people attend. Most of those who come are
"picked" men—picked by those who have something to
gain by their attendance.
It would be startling to all—especially these self-ap
pointed "fixers" —if the lobby were jammed with men who
cared nothing about the results except that the best candi
dates were selected. Imagine their fallen faces when in
stead of Tom, Dick, and Harry from their clubs, they saw
men who had been given no instructions. Imagine their
intestinal quivering as one by one the slated men are de
feated.
Stanford students learn all about political fixing in
their courses. That same fixing exists on the campus. The
one difference is that on the campus it is so easy to smash
the machine and send the actually little (though inflated)
fixers cunning for cover like Belgian hares at the bark of
a puppy.
Men who live in the Halls, men who live in Palo Alto,
non-fraternitv men, attend tonight's caucus and have some
fun.

bosses and their political henchmen are very funny things.
They lake themselves so seriously; and take everyone else
for plain fools. Of course, the funniest ones are those that
profess complete freedom from political interest but in
reality are so far in it that thin applesauce flows from
them like drool from Baby Henry, age three.
It is this crowd that are attempting to use the Hall
caucus as a rubber stamp for their own desires.
Now, in the world outside our gates, this is common
practice. But collegians should have too great a sense of
liumor to countenance such applesauce to flow on its
happy way unchecked.
The caucus tonight is open to all men not living in the
fraternities. They should come and join in the fun of
splitting the bosses' pork barrels wide open. The power of
the cliques that try to run the caucus lies in the fact that
so few people attend. Most of those who come are
"picked" men—picked by those who have something to
gain by their attendance.
It would be startling to all—especially these self-ap
pointed "fixers" —if the lobby were jammed with men who
cared nothing about the results except that the best candi
dates were selected. Imagine their fallen faces when in
stead of Tom, Dick, and Harry from their clubs, they saw
men who had been given no instructions. Imagine their
intestinal quivering as one by one the slated men are de
feated.
Stanford students learn all about political fixing in
their courses. That same fixing exists on the campus. The
one difference is that on the campus it is so easy to smash
the machine and send the actually little (though inflated)
fixers cunning for cover like Belgian hares at the bark of
a puppy.
Men who live in the Halls, men who live in Palo Alto,
non-fraternitv men, attend tonight's caucus and have some
fun.
