# Cap & Gown Will Troop Tonight
## 
### 
According to tradition, tonight while Stanford maidens
nibble and peck at their salads, Cap & (io\vners —docked
out in caps and gowns -troop to the dining rooms, troop
up to nervous co-eds, lap them. Those tapped then are
members of (Zap and down, women's honorary society.
According to rumor, tonight it will be different. The
trooping will be the same. The costumes will be the same.
Hut the co-eds will not be nervous; because rumor hath il
that the. co-eds will have been phoned in advance. Only
those who indicate their willingness to join up with the
long will be tapped.
We cannot believe this rumor and would not even take
note of it except that the sources are high and fairly
mighty.
If .(lap and flown were to stoop to finding out the de
sires of the. prospective members in advance, il would
mean that this proud organization was afraid of being
refused. Surely, an organization like C&G can remain
standing against the haughty "na's" of martyr-like co-eds.
To shv from the prospective cold shoulder is a sign of in
ternal weakness in Cap and down that has never mani
fested itself before.
Further, il is downright cruelly to rob these coeds of
that great inner pleasure of refusing the great honor that
is being tendered them. Some people like martyring—just
:is we enjoy motoring or sleeping. To rob us of the right
to sleep is criminal. To rob them of the right to martyr is
just as criminal, probably more cruel.
Hut fundamentally, the rumor, if true, is indicative of
something more important than the feelings of either C&G
or of the prospective members. #
If any number of women will refuse membership in
this once haughty organization, it means that women no
longer revere that name. It means either thai Stanford
women have become martyr-mad or that they feel that
C&G does not stand for the right things in Stanford wo
manhood.
We don't know which explanation is correct. We do
hope the rumor is false. We. do hope that i< C&G is re
fused, they will either stand loudly and fearlessly for what
Ihcv think is right <>r mend their ways.
