PORTRAIT OF MRS. SIDDONS
By Naomi Royde-Sniith
(New York, The Viking Press, 19.'}:])
To those with a love of the theatre,
especially of the historic theatre, this
picture of the greatest tragic actress
the world has known will have an
immense fascination.
"The plan of this book is that of
the full-length and ceremonial
portraits of the late 18th century,
the greatest period of English
painting, and the period during
which Mrs. Siddons lived and was
actually painted by Stuart, Ham
ilton, Romney, Gainsborough,
Reynolds, Lawrence, and other
less important artists."
With that as her plan, Naomi-
Royde Smith uses a skillful and in
teresting style to paint a portrait
even more intimate than those fa
mous canvasses which she enume
rates. With careful shading, she fills
in a vivid background of the theatre
and society, against which the cen
tral figure stands out in sharp out
line.
Sarah Siddons, in addition to being
a great actress, was evidently a very
interesting woman, and this narra
tive of her life makes it vastly easier
to understand why she was both.
The author achieves a nice shading
between the actress and the woman,
only occasionally—and pardonably—
overemphasizing the former.
This overemphasis is found most
noticeably in the rather too long
passages in which are enumerated
in detail plots of three of Mrs. Sid
dons' plays, act by act and almost
scene by scene. These sections might
well have been condensed.
Most welcome elaboration is found,
however, in her minute considera
tions of several of the main portraits
of the actress by contemporary art
ists. The famous "Tragick Muse"
becomes an even more thrilling
painting with the reading of this
work, and Sir Thomas Lawrence is
made intensely real and interesting
—in fact the outstanding minor
character.
Sarah Siddons' numerous roles—
her greatest was Lady Macbeth—
are brought out vividly, transport
ing the reader back to the stages ol
Drury Lane and Convent Garden of
over a century ago. —Chapin
