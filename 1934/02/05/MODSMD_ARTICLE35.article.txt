# CAMPUS OPINION
## A 						CHAPERONE'S DISCLAIMER 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Realizing that most faculty letters
i to student publications are either
I ill-advised or mis-interpreted, it is
I only the most urgent considerations
| which prompt this letter. You may
j imagine with what embarrassment
Mrs. Clokie and I read in a city
newspaper the regulations which are
1 supposed to apply at dormitory
dances, for we had chaperoned the
' most recent dance at Toyon. It was
i especially disconcerting in view of
the fact that, desiring to see the liv
i ing quarters, we wandered along the
corridors and visited the rooms of
one of my students. Needless to say,
we found young ladies in the rooms
of ir.any students; some with doors
■ open, some with doors closed, others
' with doors locked.
i It happens that we have not acted
as chaperones for eight years as our
i experience on another campus made
; it evident that the task was not for
I us. But now since the urge to break
i the prohibition laws has disappeared,
and a 1 ; we were mildly interested in
1 attending a Stanford dance and vis
iting Toyon, we accepted the invita

tion. We were definitely told by the
student speaking for the commiitee
that no other chaperones were pres- |
ent, that regulations permitted lady
guests visiting their hosts' rooms be
tween dances, and that the "police" !
were only retained to keep out non
subscribers or non-members.
Accordingly I want to disclaim |
publicly all responsibility for the
condemnation of visits to rooms. We !
did not report it, or consider re- j
porting it. Further I wish to protest I
most vigorously against the negli- !
gence or ignorance of the committee :
who have brought such a public.
reprimand upon us. Regardless of
the merits of regulations, about i
which it is not for me to speak, and [
apart from the knowledge to be as- \
sumed in a chaperone, the obliga- |
tion rests on every organization to
conduct its business in accordance j
with the regulations. Chaperones i
are not police. Whatever usefulness i
they have ceases the moment it be- !
comes necessary for them to exercise
openly a restraining influence.
Yours, etc.,

The Editor, Sir:
Realizing that most faculty letters
i to student publications are either
I ill-advised or mis-interpreted, it is
I only the most urgent considerations
| which prompt this letter. You may
j imagine with what embarrassment
Mrs. Clokie and I read in a city
newspaper the regulations which are
1 supposed to apply at dormitory
dances, for we had chaperoned the
' most recent dance at Toyon. It was
i especially disconcerting in view of
the fact that, desiring to see the liv
i ing quarters, we wandered along the
corridors and visited the rooms of
one of my students. Needless to say,
we found young ladies in the rooms
of ir.any students; some with doors
■ open, some with doors closed, others
' with doors locked.
i It happens that we have not acted
as chaperones for eight years as our
i experience on another campus made
; it evident that the task was not for
I us. But now since the urge to break
i the prohibition laws has disappeared,
and a 1 ; we were mildly interested in
1 attending a Stanford dance and vis
iting Toyon, we accepted the invita

tion. We were definitely told by the
student speaking for the commiitee
that no other chaperones were pres- |
ent, that regulations permitted lady
guests visiting their hosts' rooms be
tween dances, and that the "police" !
were only retained to keep out non
subscribers or non-members.
Accordingly I want to disclaim |
publicly all responsibility for the
condemnation of visits to rooms. We !
did not report it, or consider re- j
porting it. Further I wish to protest I
most vigorously against the negli- !
gence or ignorance of the committee :
who have brought such a public.
reprimand upon us. Regardless of
the merits of regulations, about i
which it is not for me to speak, and [
apart from the knowledge to be as- \
sumed in a chaperone, the obliga- |
tion rests on every organization to
conduct its business in accordance j
with the regulations. Chaperones i
are not police. Whatever usefulness i
they have ceases the moment it be- !
comes necessary for them to exercise
openly a restraining influence.
Yours, etc.,
H. M. Clokie,
Professor of Political Science
