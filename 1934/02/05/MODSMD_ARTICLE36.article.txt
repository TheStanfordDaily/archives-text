# THE 						"MODERN MISS" AND AVIATION AGAIN
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Concerning the comments made on
! the aviation question, I wish to say :
! that they have been entirely due to ,
•' the unenlightened editorial which '
1 appeared in the Daily last Monday. i
i As long as "damned airplanes" are j
spoken of in such terms, I shall con
j tinue to make answer. If it's exhibi
j tionlsm to stand up for something
i which seems to be abysmally mis-
I understood—then I am an exhibi
! tionist. As long as aviation is slan
, dered I shall continue to be a

■ so-called exhibitionist.
Aviation is the coming thing in j
the world and should be recognized j
as such. If anyone wishes to argue I
the point, it should be taken up with ■
the wox-ld powers, and not with one i
mere flyer out of the thousands. If,
however, the criticism is purely per
sonal as the "Ego in tailspins" sug
gests, then I humbly and sincerely j
apologize. I, as a person, have noth
ing to do with the question, BUT, as j
a flyer, I shall continue to stand up
for aviation. —26889
