# Air Beef

### 
William MacCracken, Jr., formerly
Hoover air secretary, will be under
the gun today before the Senate (in
vestigating again) to explain why he
defied a Senate investigating com
mittee when they touched on the
delicate subject of why certain air
mail carriers got big Federal sub
sidies.
The riled white-beards of the na
tion are also thinking about asking
more questions. L. H. Brittin, of
Northwest Airways, was promi
nently mentioned. Highlights: some
papers have been removed from
some files, two or three witnesses
have skipped their sub peon a;
chances are Senate investigators,
getting foxy by now, will be able to
learn something.
