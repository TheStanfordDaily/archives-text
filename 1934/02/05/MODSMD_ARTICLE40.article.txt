# SURELY NOT SARCASM?

The Editor, Sir:
What has happened to Cap and
Gown? It certainly received an
avalanche of criticism last fall with
out a hint of a comeback. What is
the matter? Has it disbanded, or has
it reorganized? If it has not dis
banded (and we don't think it has),
it should certainly let its prospective
members know its plans of reor
ganization before dragging them in.
That is only ethical. We should
think that the elevated sorority-like
bunch would be afraid to show their
black gowns in a dining hall without
their new stand being known or
without being sure of their prey.
Somebody would surely turn them'
down and, Oh, dear, what a blow
that would be. Listen, Cap and
Gown, here's a swell idea. Why not
call up your chosen ones before
going into the dining halls, and make
sure that no one will turn you down?
That would be a nice courageous
thing to do. Take heed, you pros
pective Cap and Gowners. Would you
like to be affiliated with an organi
zation that did not have the guts to
walk up to you in a dining hall—
that is so weak and spineless that
it will make sure of your acceptance
by sneaking your invitation to you
first? If you do, you will certainly
be a marvelous addition to the se
lected little group. A solution: Cap
and Gown will a natural death
now —let's all shout for joy.
—Irate! Grad?
