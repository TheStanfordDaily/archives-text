# YEARLINGS TRIM CUBS, 41 TO 28
## 
### Mort D'Evelyn 
Once again outplaying the Blue
and Gold yearlings- in all depart
ments of the game, Jimmy Bvad
shaw's frosh basketball five trimmed
the California frosh 41-28 in the pre
liminary to the varsity encounter at
Berkeley Saturday night.
As predicted, the Bear offense was
vastly improvea over that which lost
to Stanford, 47-17, two weeks ago.
In the defensive line the U.C. frosh
made no noticeable improvement,
and they allowed Cardinal Howell
Turner to slip in five set-ups.
Turner Starts Early
Turner's ability to catch the Cal
guards napping was obvious from
the opening whistle when the elusive
Red forward dropped in two push
ins to give the Stanford frosh a 4-0
lead. California came back shortly
later when Greenwood swished the
first of several shots from the center
court area. Dinty Moore followed
with another set-up for Stanford,
and the Indians maintained at least
a 5-point lead during the remainder
ol the play.
Bill Quade made good on his side
court chances to join Turner in the
scoring column and allow the Babes
to leave the floor at half time with
a comfortable 20-13 lead.
Stanford too Good
During the second period, the Bear
Cubs kept plugging with the same
spirit that marked their earlier play,
but they just couldn't match the
Stanford offense. Dale Beedle, Red
center, tanked a couple of fancy
shots from the sidq, and, with Tur
ner and Quade still ringing the hoop,
the Cards moved away fast. The long
shots of Sparks and Greenwood were
the only Cub threats.
For the Card frosh, Turner played
.steady and accurate ball, scored 13
points in the first half and 4 in the
second to be high point man of the
evening. By crashing through on
tip-off plays, Turner proved Stan
ford's only hope of breaking up the
Bear monopoly in this department
during the second half. Quade fol
lowed with 10 digits.
The Stanford box score:
Player— Fg Ft Pts.
Turner, f 8 1 17
Quade, f 4 2 10

center, tanked a couple of fancy
shots from the sidq, and, with Tur
ner and Quade still ringing the hoop,
the Cards moved away fast. The long
shots of Sparks and Greenwood were
the only Cub threats.
For the Card frosh, Turner played
.steady and accurate ball, scored 13
points in the first half and 4 in the
second to be high point man of the
evening. By crashing through on
tip-off plays, Turner proved Stan
ford's only hope of breaking up the
Bear monopoly in this department
during the second half. Quade fol
lowed with 10 digits.
The Stanford box score:
Player— Fg Ft Pts.
Turner, f 8 1 17
Quade, f 4 2 10
Beedle, c 3 2 8
Moore, g 2 2 G

Once again outplaying the Blue
and Gold yearlings- in all depart
ments of the game, Jimmy Bvad
shaw's frosh basketball five trimmed
the California frosh 41-28 in the pre
liminary to the varsity encounter at
Berkeley Saturday night.
As predicted, the Bear offense was
vastly improvea over that which lost
to Stanford, 47-17, two weeks ago.
In the defensive line the U.C. frosh
made no noticeable improvement,
and they allowed Cardinal Howell
Turner to slip in five set-ups.
Turner Starts Early
Turner's ability to catch the Cal
guards napping was obvious from
the opening whistle when the elusive
Red forward dropped in two push
ins to give the Stanford frosh a 4-0
lead. California came back shortly
later when Greenwood swished the
first of several shots from the center
court area. Dinty Moore followed
with another set-up for Stanford,
and the Indians maintained at least
a 5-point lead during the remainder
ol the play.
Bill Quade made good on his side
court chances to join Turner in the
scoring column and allow the Babes
to leave the floor at half time with
a comfortable 20-13 lead.
Stanford too Good
During the second period, the Bear
Cubs kept plugging with the same
spirit that marked their earlier play,
but they just couldn't match the
Stanford offense. Dale Beedle, Red
center, tanked a couple of fancy
shots from the sidq, and, with Tur
ner and Quade still ringing the hoop,
the Cards moved away fast. The long
shots of Sparks and Greenwood were
the only Cub threats.
