# Second Half Drive Nets Bears 42-25 Win Over Cardinals
## Hopes for Title Chance Fade After Defeat 
### Frank Tremaine 
Snowed under by tin avalanche of
second half baskets on the part of
Hal Eifert and his California cohorts,
Stanford's hopes of upsetting the
dope twice in a row and becoming a
real power in the 1934 basketball
lace went glimmering Saturday night
as the Bears soundly whipped the
Indians 42 to 25.
Had it not been for Stanford's al
most perfect foul shooting, the Cali
fornia margin of victory might have
been even greater, 17 of the Stanford
points coming via the free throw
route. Gordy Mallatratt made an al
most-unprecedented record of eight
points out of nine shots from the
foul line.
Many Fouls
The game brought a new high in
fculs, officials Fitzpatrick and Con
lon calling 38 penalties, 21 of them
on California. However, the pen
alties caused Stanford more trouble
than the Bears as Captain Hal Ede
len went out with four just before
the first half ended : >nd Charlie Rog
i ors followed him shortly after the
start of the second.
California's tight man-for-man de
fense proved a little too much for
i the Cardinals, only eight Stanford
| points being made on field goals.
Stanford's guards managed to hold
most of the Bears in check, but £i
, fert was just too much for them,
; ringing up 14 points from the floor
| and two from Ihe foul line.
First Half Lively
i The first 15 minutes of the game
looked like a real battle. Stanford
went into the lead when Rogers
' opened the scoring with a free throw
on McGaffey's foul. McGaffey and
Kenney followed with a point apiece
on free throws to give California a
one-point lead which was immedia
tely wiped out by Rogers' basket
! from the sideline.
Mallatratt added a point on a free
throw, but Eifert tied the score with
the opening shot of his barrage.
Mallatratt and Edelen countered
with points on free throws but at
this point the Bear scorers began to
get the range and Englehard and
Kcnney quickly brought the score
up to 10 to G with a field goal and
l'ree throw apiece.
The half ended with Stanford still
within striking distance, 17 to 12, but
before the second period was well
under way, California was off to the
races scoring 25 points to the In
dians' 13. McGaffey broke the ice
when Meek picked a long shot out
of the air and passed to him under
Ihe basket for a set-up.
IWallatratt Good
With Edelen and Rogers both out,
the brunt of the Indian defense fell
on Gordy Mallatratt, whose scrappy
playing was one of the features of
the game but which couldn't quite
make up for his lack of height. Top
ping and Anderson, Stanford's chief
scoring threats, were tightly bottled
up by the California guards, and
neither were able to dent the scor
ing column from the floor.
