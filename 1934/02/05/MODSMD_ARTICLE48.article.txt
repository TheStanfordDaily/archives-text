# CARD NINE LOSES OPENING GAME TO ATHENS CLUB, 7-6
## 
### 
Victory was snatched from the
Stanford varsity baseball team Sat
urday when the Athens Club scored
two runs in the last inning to break
a 5 to 5 deadlock and successfully
repelled a last desperate effort of the
Cardinals. The Cards managed to
push over one run before the game
ended, but that was insufficient and
the clubmen won, 7 to (i. in the sea
son's opening game.
Behind the masterful pitching of
Stan Anderson, who held the visitors
to two hits and one tally in four in
nmgi before being relieved by Her
inger, Stanford pounded Fagundas,
Athens twirler, hard to establish a
5 to I lead going into the sixth. In
this frame the Athenians scored four
times on three lusty base clouts and
i. pair of costly Stanford errors.
The Winning Run
In the hectic ninth inning with
two out, Lancione, after beating out
a perfect bunt down the third base
line, stole second and scored when
Martin singled sharply to right. The
latter counted the winning tally a
few moments later from second when
Trautman threw wild to first on
Burns' grounder. Clifford flew out
to Moscrip in left to retire the side.
In Stanford's half of the inning,
Trautman was safe when Gardiner,
at first base, dropped his hard liner.
Maggiora singled to right, advancing
Trautman to second Beach roiled
out to Clifford at second, and Traut
man, in an effort to score on the play,
was caught between third and home.
Scores on "Pickle"
Then Sinibaldi, Athens catcher,
bounced the ball off Trautman's
back in the subsequent "pickle" and
the latter scored when the ball rolled
into the outfield. On the same play
Maggiora was picked off second base
for the second out. Moscrip ended
the game when he rolled an easy one
to the pitcher.
Bobby Grayson, Stanford's bril
liant sophomore all-around athlete,
was the outstanding hitter of the
contest, garnering a homer and a
triple in two trips to the plate.

few moments later from second when
Trautman threw wild to first on
Burns' grounder. Clifford flew out
to Moscrip in left to retire the side.
In Stanford's half of the inning,
Trautman was safe when Gardiner,
at first base, dropped his hard liner.
Maggiora singled to right, advancing
Trautman to second Beach roiled
out to Clifford at second, and Traut
man, in an effort to score on the play,
was caught between third and home.
Scores on "Pickle"
Then Sinibaldi, Athens catcher,
bounced the ball off Trautman's
back in the subsequent "pickle" and
the latter scored when the ball rolled
into the outfield. On the same play
Maggiora was picked off second base
for the second out. Moscrip ended
the game when he rolled an easy one
to the pitcher.
Bobby Grayson, Stanford's bril
liant sophomore all-around athlete,
was the outstanding hitter of the
contest, garnering a homer and a
triple in two trips to the plate.
