sophomore hurdler, is definitely out

htillway mark in the 220 lows, the
muscle gave, Kingsbury collapsed,
barged into the next hurdle, and had
to be carried from the track. He is
to leave ihe hospital today, but will
be forced to use crutches.

the broad jump with a nice leap of
22 feet 9Vu inches, indicating de
