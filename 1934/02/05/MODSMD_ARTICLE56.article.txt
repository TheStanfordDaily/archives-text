# TRAMPS AT TOWN SHELTER TALK OF 'CABBAGES, KINGS'
## 
### Thomas Slattery 
That Palo Alto is a cultured city
is well known. What is not so well
known is that it proudly claims two
rationally renowned centers of free
ly blowing winds—Stanford Univer
sity and the City Shelter.
Every day some 60 odd transients
I arrive in town via the highway and
railroad, attracted by the praise of
the Shelter which has circulated fa
vorably throughout the "jungles" of
America. After undergoing a bath
, and a delousing process, they are
j\\ ont to foregather of an evening
around the stoves in the main re
i ception room. Here they indulge
their minds, ad infinitum, in weighty
1 discussion upon the complexities of
1 life.
Fireside Gatherings
Should the most urbane and so
phisticated college man drop in for
!an hour's diversion in the sympa-
I thetic company of other traveled
souls, he would find himself bewil
! dered by the drift of the conversa
' tion.
The discussion passes rapidly from
! such things as gondolas and reefers
I to dinging, boiling up, and sapping.
The graver considerations of flops
and sit-downs are then gone mto
minutely.
The latest on the scratch houses of
the nation is brought to light and
j tabulated in the spacious recesses of
j the transients' mental files. "Good
towns"- are eulogized at length, and
! the intriguing matter of train con
i nections and schedules is touched
I
) upon with the right attention to de
i tail.

I aginative guests of the shelter, cab-
I bage has but one connotation. It
suggests an intemperate use of in
; vective against the fare of the usual
Salvation Army.
On the topic of kings, considerable
enthusiasm is evinced. There is but
one. He is Tex, K. T. (king of
