## Education Money Authority To Express Views On Federal Support LECTURES OVER KPO Tells Teachers' Situation At 7: 45 O'clock Tonight 
### Emerson Honan 
Three million American children
i are without school facilities this
year, announces Dr. Jesse Brundage
I Sears, professor of education at the
University, and speaker on tonight's
i edition of the Stanford series of edu
i catio'nal talks given over radio sta
tion KPO at 7:45 o'clock.
Dr. Sears believes that the time
has come for government action
when one quarter of the public
school teachers of> the country are
receiving less than the minimum
wage required for a day laborer un
der the N.R.A., and when the United
States Office of Education predicts
| that 120,000 rural schools will have
| closed by April 1.
National Authority
Few men are better qualified to
speak on "Federal Support for Pub
lic Schools," for Dr. Sears is a rec
ognized national authority on school
finance.
He has been investigating this
| problem on a national scope for over
120 years, and is the author of sev-
I cral books and articles. His "School
Survey," part of the Piiverside series
' edited by Dr. Ellwood P. Cubberley,
and his volume on the cost of schools
in California, resulting from his work
on the Finance Inquiry Commission
of the Commonwealth Club, are
both accepted as standard works on
; the financial problems of the public
i schools.
Thus country now has a million
j more high school students than in
I 1930, but it has 52,000 less teachers,
jand a study of 393 cities shows that
I school budgets have been 33 per
; cent since that time, creating a crisis
which Federal aid will be needed to
j relieve.
Federal Aid Needed
Furthermore, the present number
of unemployed gives assurance that
further expansion of work in adult
education must be expected.
The present situation requires
Federal relief, and Dr. Sears' speech
wiil explain whether this relief will
be only temporary or a permanent
| necessity. He will aiso discuss the
i possibility that national support will
! imply Federal control of educational
l facilities throughout the country.
