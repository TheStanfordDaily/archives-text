Notable Spanish painter, Senor
Jose Moya del Pino, wilk give an
illustrated lecture on Spanish art at
4:15 o'clock tomorrow in the Little
Theatre. The subject of the taTk
will be "The History of Spanish
Painting," and examples of works of
art discussed will bo shown by elec
trie slides.
del Pino, who has been living in
San Francisco for the last 10 years, j
is especially known as being the only !
painter who has made a reproduc
tion of the complete works of Velas- j
quez. Under the auspices of Al
phonso XIII, king of Spain, del Pino
visited museums all over Europe and j
copied the paintings of the great i
master.
The collection of del Pino, finished
10 years ago, was exhibited in Ma
drid and later in the Golden Gate
Museum for a whole summer about
six years ago. Now the group is
being displayed' in the library of the
University of California, which is j
arranging to purchase the whole col
lection.
Outside of these works, del Pino |
is famous as a portrait painter. Many '
portraits to his credit show a great,
deal of labor in this field also. The
artist is an authority on the history
of Spanish painting and for many
years gave lectures on this topic at
the famous Art Institute of San Fer
nando in Madrid.
All those who are interested are
invited to attend the talk tomorrow.
