# FARM YEARBOOK OFFERS PRIZES

### Will Williams 
The Yearbook of Stanford Writing,
"representative of the best work
done by creative Stanfordites," is
progressing well under the editor
ship of James R. Broughton.
Manuscripts have been coming in
but at a rate of speed which, the
editor hopes, will increase. The 1934
publication of the Yearbook con
tinues the tradition of its predeces
sors, considers for publication work
from students of all departments in
the University. Unlike "Criteria,"
manuscripts from Stanford students
only will be accepted.
Prizes abound for work handed in
to the editors. There are the two
prizes of $25 each, offered for the
best poetry and prose, which will be
chosen by experienced judges, in
cluding professional literary men of
eminence. All contributions are eli
gible for bolh prizes.
In addition, there is the $1,000
short-story contest for undergrad
uate students which is offered by
"Story Devoted Entirely to the
Short Story." Believing as matter of
course that the best writing done on
the campus will fall into the editor's
hands, judges will take the two
stories to be selected as representa
tive of Stanlord University from
contributions offered to the Year
book. For this prize all manuscripts
are also eligible. Details will be an
nounced later.
All work submitted may be
dropped in the box marked "English
Club" just inside the door of the
English office, given to James R.
' Broughton, or Dr. Margery Bailey.
