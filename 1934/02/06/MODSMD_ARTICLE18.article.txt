# GIESEKING IS GUEST ARTIST HERE TONIGHT
## Pianist Presents a Varied Program in Concert Series Debut 
### Barbara Sweet 
Featuring a program including
such varied selections as Bach and
Debussy, Walter Gieseking is ex
pected to uphold his reputation as a
concert pianist par excellence when
he makes his Stanford debut at the
Pavilion tonight at 8:15 o'clock.
Gieseking, who played last night
to a large audience in San Fran
cisco's War Memorial opera house,
is well known in Europe, though
this is only his second American
tour.
Not Encouraged
Of German parentage, he was
never encouraged as a child to pur
sue his artistic talents, his father
believing he should perfect himself
phjsically before attempting to fol
low a musical career.
Gieseking himself is of the opin
ion that children .should not be sub
jected to the strenuous study re
quired in order to achieve artistic
distinction. He does believe that a
child who shows a love of music by
singing or humming should be taught
some musical instrument, but he is
not at all in sympathy with the par
ent who exploits the child prodigy.
Sale Good
The seat sale for the Gieseking
concert has been excellent, Prentice
Messimer, Concert Series manager,
said yesterday. Tickets will be on
sale from 9 to 4:30 o'clock at the
Scries office, and the box office will
cpen at 7:15 o'clock. Tickets for the
Rosa Ponselle concert will also be
on sale at the same time.
Ushers are requested to appear at
the Pavilion at 7:15 o'clock and
should wear dark suits.
