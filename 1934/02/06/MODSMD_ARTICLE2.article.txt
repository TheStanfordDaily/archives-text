# Paris Troubles
## 
### 
A skyrocketing dollar continued to j
cause chaos in continental banking |
circles yesterday despite promise by j
U.S. bankers to refrain from raiding !
France's gold reserves. Belief was j
that French banks would also re- !
frain from drawing on Paris gold j
reserves.
While speculators made a franc on I
every dollar used to purchase gold j
French gold drain continued, Paris j
bankers advanced ihe belief that j
U.S. action could stop the flight of j
France's gold.
