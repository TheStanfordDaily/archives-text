# Roughs Corsage Taboo Weakened by New '300'
## 
### 
Stanford's most economical tradi- '
tion is passingâ€”to the delight of co
eds and the sorrow of pecuniary
roughs. The corsage taboo which
made even a single rosebud a hei
nous crime a few years ago is weak
ening this year.
Despite additional Farm women, ,
Palo Alto florists report that there
has been a decided increase in the
number of corsages sent by Stan
ford men to their campus dates.
More remarkable yet is the quantity
of boxes of flowers which find their
way to the Union, Roble, and the
sororities during the week.
One shop said that the students [
were spending more money on (low
ers this year than they have in the
nasi, Evidence of this is the unpre

cedented popularity of the orchid,
which used to mean that at least an
engagement was in the offing.
"We have sold many more orchids
this year than last. In spite of the
depression, they went very well for
Big Game nignt and for campus par
ties and dances."
But the gardenia is still prime fa
vorite with Stanford men, princi
pally, the florists say, because it
"goes with everything" and the boys
;.re not often very certain what color
dress the girl friend is going to
wear.
With the exception of freshmen
who are usually much confused over
buying their first corsage, the men
know what they want, and would
lather pick out the flowers them
selves than phone in an order.
