# Only Students of State Schools to Get Federal Aid
## 
### 
Stanford students will not
benefit from the some six or
seven million dollars that the
Federal government is going to
extend to colicgiates working
their way through, because the
University is not a state, tax
supported institution.
Only colleges of the non
profit variety will come in for a
share of the Washington money
that will help needy students
throughout the country by
means of part-time jobs paying
from $10 to $20 a month.
