# Engineering Is Topic of Third Majors Speech
## Vocations to Be Discussed By Professor Green 
### 
Professor Boynton M. Green,
member of the Vocational Guidance
and Lower Division Committees will
represent the School of Engineering
at 7:15 o'clock tomorrow evening
when he will give the third of the
series of department major lectures
in the Little Theatre.
"Half of the students who gradu
ate change their vocation within five
years," says Dr. E. K. Strong, Jr.,
chairman of the Vocational Guid
ance Committee and professor of
psychology, who is one of the spon
sors of the lecture-discussion series.
This fact revealed by Dr. Strong's
figures shows a need for a more
careful selection of majors by lower
division students. One of the main
purposes of these talks given by
leading men of the various depart
ments is to give students a better
factual basis for selecting majors
and their consequent life work,
stresses Dr. Strong.
He explained that many students
do give serious thought to the choos
ing of their university course, but
that there are some who take the
first school or department that some
one mentions and are later forced to
bear the consequences.
The lecture series is being con
ducted by Dr. C. Gilbert Wrenn, who
is being assisted by a student com
mittee.
