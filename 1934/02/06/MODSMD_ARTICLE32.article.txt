j Cap and Gown is a co-operative
i organization, consisting of active,
alumnae and honorary members,
which represent the interests of all
the women concerned with the cam

$800 Loan Fund
Projects in which the organization
' participates are the maintenance of
a loan fund of approximately $800,
which aids women students who are
working their way through Stan
ford. and the financing of a $300
scholarship each year. It was largely
through the efforts of Cap and Gown
in the past that the "Women's Club
house was buiit and through its sup
port in the present thyt it has been
maintained.
To quote President Emily Ross:
I "The objects of this group are to
secure for women in college I he
companionship of outstanding
women on tho campus and alum
nae, to mutually aid one another in
obtaining a broader viewpoint on
life in general, and to furnish a bond
between classes of the past and of
the future."
Purpose Expressed
Cap and Gown's purpose, as ex
pressed by the organization itself, is
"to add to the individual stature of
each member in its social and in
tellectual contacts between its ac
tive college members and its alum
nae and honorary members."
The new members of the group
and some 20 of the old members will
trek to Mrs. Edwin Thomas' cabin
in the Santa Cruz Mountains on the
week-end of March 3.
