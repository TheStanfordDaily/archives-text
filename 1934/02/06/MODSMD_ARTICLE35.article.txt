Politics may In* a horrid wort] for those whose full
concept of the activity is hanging on the receiving end of
;i kcv-hole of a meeting that plans to announce its results.
Hut there is no need that interest in governmental affairs
need he tainted in any way.
Hather it behooves students to take a healthy interest
in what goes on in this thing called student government.
The men in the Halls attempt to work up a little interest
by means of their Hall caucus. Some have interpreted this
as a challenge to fraternity men; an invitation to a free
for-all fight of mud and men. Nothing could be further
from the truth. Some have criticized the Daily for bring
into the open what has been notoriously kept quiet. We
see no harm in impartial statement of the facts.
Should the fraternity men think it necessary to have
a caucus, the /)aily would give it equal publicity.
We have long felt it quite ridiculous that some people
should consider politics at Stanford as a thing of geo
graphical boundaries. There are some lame brains that
bold all south of Alvarado is horrid and all north is splen
did. Hut there is no acounting for lame brains.
There is no fundamental distinction between Hall and
How except that the former get their rooms through the
Dean of Men's office and the latter get theirs through the
lawyer's office. To run politics according to where a man
happens to throw his cords at night as a bit asinine.
It would be splendid if politics were aligned according
to party principles, but there are no principles.
The Daily believes it has the next best idea. It will wait
till all living groups have made their nominations. Then
it will request platforms of the candidates. It will ask
them questions. It will print platforms and answers.
It mav be unfair to make campus politicians think, but
we will be unfair in that measure.
It may be a necessary evil that men are nominated by
living groups, but at least thev do not have to be elected
on that basis. They can be asked to explain themselves
and then let the students decide who is best and why.
Today is the day for nominations and prospective can
didates might as well face the horrible future: the need to
find a reason for their running.
