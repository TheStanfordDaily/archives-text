## 
### 
The rumor that Cap and Gown, afraid of the naying of
coeds, would inquire into their feelings in re Cap and
(iown before bidding them, was just a rumor. Last night,
the (lap and Gowners look their girls—fifteen in number.
Striking is the fact that none asked, refused; in reverse,
;ill asked accepted.
On the front page of the Daily, the sisters explain their
aims, aspirations, and accomplishments. They seem mighty
worthy. Last quarter, some girls left the organization be
cause it did not suit them. They wanted to change the
method of election. They failed.
The new organization will go on. It may not be as good
as what the rebels planned. Hut C&G, withstanding the
barrage that has been leveled at it, seems to be still stand
ing through all the steam. The revolt and the return to nor
malcy has seemed to revitalize the organization. Maybe,
they will do more and more.
At least, they deserve an oportunitv to show whether
those that comitted C&G harikari died in vain, or whether
they died with the truth on their lips.
