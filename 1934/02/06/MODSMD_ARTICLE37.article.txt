A gallant tempest in a Campus Opinion column lias
been raging in the Daily for a few days. It all has to do
with whether the Reviewer has the correct estimation of
what is being produced in Hollywood. That is a moot
question, and in this editorial the Daily desires to speak
on a question over which there is no controversy at least
not on the campus.
For years Chaparral fought with pen and ink in that
inimitable Chaparral manner for the reduction of show
prices in Palo Alto. Then the Daily entered the struggle,
and following the Daily came the depression and the show
houses capitulated. The prices were reduced. There was
rejoicing. The campus and the theatres became bosom
pals -we slept in their shows and they look our money.
Kvcryone was satisfied.
liut now, prices have been lipped. The seats arc still
twenty-five cents for those that can get the twenty-five
cent seats. Few can. Kveryonc else is forced into that
millionaire class of plutocrats forced to produce 110 less
than forty cents.
Nothing is more productive of bad feeling lack of
good-will, merchants call it than to be forced to pay forty
c<'iils when the intent is twenty-five cents.
We suggest to the theatre owners that they reduce
prices generally or extend the limits of the cheap seat area.
The old system of giving students a Y)reak with their stu
denl-bodv cards is too wonderful to think about.
