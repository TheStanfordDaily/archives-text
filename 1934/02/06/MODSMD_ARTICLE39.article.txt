## TOYON DANCE SELLS OUT, REQUESTS AID! 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
May I take this opportunity to say
a few things regarding the Toyon
Formal? First, I want to publicly
express the sincere appreciation of
the dance committee to the follow
ing firms in S;in Francisco for equip
ment loaned to u.s: Weeks-Howe-
Emerson Co., the Grace Steamship
Lines, Savery Bros., and to Bill Wag
non, Jr.
And, secondly, I want to make this
request to those attending the dance.
All these decorations have been
loaned to us, and any damage or loss
is necessarily borne by the chairman
of the committee. So please regard
the various equipment as property

of considerable value, and co-oper
ate with us.
And, lastly, regarding the bid sale,
the committee has been completely
overwhelmed at the speed with
which bids have been sold, and we
are sorry that we cannot meet the
demand by printing more, but to
keep the attendance down to permit
comfortable dancing, it would be im
possible to do so.
So, to those who were too late for
the bid sale, we hope that Toyon
Club will be t'ble to stage a in
the future under conditions that will
allow the attendance of everyone.
Very sincerely yours,
"Red" Cross, '34,
Acting Committee Chairman.
