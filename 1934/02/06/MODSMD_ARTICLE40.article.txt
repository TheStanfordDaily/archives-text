# REVIEWING IN THE MODERN MANNER
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It is with great pleasure that I
have recently noticed the rise of a
new school of criticism on the cam
pus. That this new school of criti
cism will perhaps give birth to more
surprising than solid statements does
not detract from my pleasure. Now
we can safely say that critical judg
ment will need no more solid train
ing in critical principles (what the
exponents of the new school are
prone to call highbrow-ism) than
is generally attributed to the vege
table merchant or to the man who
sells odds-and-ends at a country
fair. It is truly a step worthy of
commendation — this popularizing of
dramatic opinion, so that we may all
know what is good and what is bad
in the world of the. movie—simply
by the drop of the hat or the clap of
the hand. And what more can we
fsk, in the course of our viewing
these movies, than the tremendous
ovation which follows the exhibition
of a particularly popular scene, or
the sibilant condemnation of one es
pecially disapproved of! Final judg
ment, like that of the dreaded In
quisition, will sit upon the august
bench and deal out its crushing nays

or its exuberant ayes with such
force that Hollywood will be dictated
by its ruling hand.
Further, having eliminated from
consideration the drawbacks which
naturally develop from following the
example set by supposed masters
such as Shakespeare, Shaw, and
Elizabeth Chapin, this new school
will express itself with new and en
lightened clarity and profundity, and
with telling effect. Will it not indeed
be a feeling of glorious satisfaction
to be greeted in the, pages of our
new and constructive criticism, with
such guides, indefatigable as they
are infallible, as these: "Marian Da
vies sure was swell!" "That Crosby
fellow sings like nobody's business!"
"The show is lousy, just plain lousy!
Yeah, too much of that intrigue stuff
—not enough straight - from - the
shoulder!" And when pressed for
further explanation of its verdict: "I
say its bum, isn't that enough? It's
lousy!" But need I go on? Such
criticism is destined to take the place
of George Jean Nathan and kindred
spirits, for it is, after all, the voice
of Young America, who wishes to be
entertained, and that, justly.
Respectfully and expectantly.

ment, like that of the dreaded In
quisition, will sit upon the august
bench and deal out its crushing nays

or its exuberant ayes with such
force that Hollywood will be dictated
by its ruling hand.
Further, having eliminated from
consideration the drawbacks which
naturally develop from following the
example set by supposed masters
such as Shakespeare, Shaw, and
Elizabeth Chapin, this new school
will express itself with new and en
lightened clarity and profundity, and
with telling effect. Will it not indeed
be a feeling of glorious satisfaction
to be greeted in the, pages of our
new and constructive criticism, with
such guides, indefatigable as they
are infallible, as these: "Marian Da
vies sure was swell!" "That Crosby
fellow sings like nobody's business!"
"The show is lousy, just plain lousy!
Yeah, too much of that intrigue stuff
—not enough straight - from - the
shoulder!" And when pressed for
further explanation of its verdict: "I
say its bum, isn't that enough? It's
lousy!" But need I go on? Such
criticism is destined to take the place
of George Jean Nathan and kindred
spirits, for it is, after all, the voice
of Young America, who wishes to be
entertained, and that, justly.
Respectfully and expectantly.

The Editor, Sir:
It is with great pleasure that I
have recently noticed the rise of a
new school of criticism on the cam
pus. That this new school of criti
cism will perhaps give birth to more
surprising than solid statements does
not detract from my pleasure. Now
we can safely say that critical judg
ment will need no more solid train
ing in critical principles (what the
exponents of the new school are
prone to call highbrow-ism) than
is generally attributed to the vege
table merchant or to the man who
sells odds-and-ends at a country
fair. It is truly a step worthy of
commendation — this popularizing of
dramatic opinion, so that we may all
know what is good and what is bad
in the world of the. movie—simply
by the drop of the hat or the clap of
the hand. And what more can we
fsk, in the course of our viewing
these movies, than the tremendous
ovation which follows the exhibition
of a particularly popular scene, or
the sibilant condemnation of one es
pecially disapproved of! Final judg
ment, like that of the dreaded In
quisition, will sit upon the august
bench and deal out its crushing nays

or its exuberant ayes with such
force that Hollywood will be dictated
by its ruling hand.
