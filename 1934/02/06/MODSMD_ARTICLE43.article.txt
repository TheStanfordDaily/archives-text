THE PRIVATE LIFE OF HENRY
VIII (London Films).
At the Stanford Theatre
II is rather sad to reriect that the
exigencies of ihe box office necessi
tated the reduction of King Henry
VIII to a bedroom buffoon, particu
larly inasmuch as lie is allowed a
few moments for deeper feeling than
pique.
But within the established limits
of the film it is entertaining despite
the fact that the spectator wiih a
delicacy for historical likelihood may
wince slightly in the midst of a
hearty laugh engendered by some
anachronistic by-play.
The cast, headed by Chavles
Laughton, is uniformly good al
though the action centers upon the
single figure of Henry to the exclu
sion of any very considerable em
phasis upon others.
This amusing history warrants at
tention for what it is, despite what
it might—with deeper purpose—have
been. ' —Sandoe
