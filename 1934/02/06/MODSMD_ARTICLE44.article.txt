# HIS DOUBLE LIFE At the Varsity Theatre
## 
### 
An odd thing, this being buried
before one's own eyes. A famous,
I hut public-shy artist changes places
with his dying valet, who is subse
quently buried with his master's
! name. In the little ironies of inci
i dent, the story is typical of the au-
I thor from whom it is adapted—Ar
nold Bennett. Our supposedly dead,
! but very much alive young genius
| now marries and enjoys a secret life
—which is where Miss Gish comes in
| as the extremely practical and very
J lovable wife.
The humorous incidents which
j evolve about the artist's identity, fi
! nally revealed in court, have that
: touch which is so well seen in some
! of Bennett's Clavhanger novels.
; Ronald Young us>es his slightly
I slumped shoulders, his shuffling
■ walk, his shifting eyes, to advantage.

The directing drags bit in spots, but
the comical scenes, depending as
they do upon little ironies of eircum- i
stances, are clear enough to be un- I
deistood.
FUGITIVE LOVERS
Despite the fact that this finds
Robert Montgomery in a roie dif
ferent from his usual one of drawing !
room wit and handsome lover, it is ;
remarkably well-filmed, with plenty
of good action to keep it going.
It is the usual theme of a prison j
getaway, but it uses the transconti
nental bus as its locale, and the pur
suing coppers are obliging enough to
allow a few love-scenes before re
claiming the prisoner. Robert makes j
a handsome prisoner, bui he has lit
tle opportunity to usa the sparkling
eyes, which seem to go well only j
with a cocktail shaker or the strong i
moonlight.
Madge Evans is pleasant enough j
as Mr. Montgomery's spiritual at
tache—a vast improvement over the '
sort of thing which the school of
Stanwyck and Crawford are accus- i
tomed to put on. It is packed with
action —all well-connected with a j
somewhat obvious plot, all leading
to an end which one can easily pre- j
diet, but nevertheless feels thor- |
oughly satisfied with. Good enter- '
tainment, and the bus scenes are ty- i
pical, if not comfortable.

action —all well-connected with a j
somewhat obvious plot, all leading

An odd thing, this being buried
before one's own eyes. A famous,
I hut public-shy artist changes places
with his dying valet, who is subse
quently buried with his master's
! name. In the little ironies of inci
i dent, the story is typical of the au-
I thor from whom it is adapted—Ar
nold Bennett. Our supposedly dead,
! but very much alive young genius
| now marries and enjoys a secret life
—which is where Miss Gish comes in
| as the extremely practical and very
J lovable wife.
The humorous incidents which
j evolve about the artist's identity, fi
! nally revealed in court, have that
: touch which is so well seen in some
! of Bennett's Clavhanger novels.
; Ronald Young us>es his slightly
I slumped shoulders, his shuffling
■ walk, his shifting eyes, to advantage.

The directing drags bit in spots, but
the comical scenes, depending as
they do upon little ironies of eircum- i
stances, are clear enough to be un- I
deistood.
FUGITIVE LOVERS
Despite the fact that this finds
Robert Montgomery in a roie dif
ferent from his usual one of drawing !
room wit and handsome lover, it is ;
remarkably well-filmed, with plenty
of good action to keep it going.
It is the usual theme of a prison j
getaway, but it uses the transconti
nental bus as its locale, and the pur
suing coppers are obliging enough to
allow a few love-scenes before re
claiming the prisoner. Robert makes j
a handsome prisoner, bui he has lit
tle opportunity to usa the sparkling
eyes, which seem to go well only j
with a cocktail shaker or the strong i
moonlight.
Madge Evans is pleasant enough j
as Mr. Montgomery's spiritual at
tache—a vast improvement over the '
sort of thing which the school of
Stanwyck and Crawford are accus- i
tomed to put on. It is packed with
action —all well-connected with a j
somewhat obvious plot, all leading
to an end which one can easily pre- j
diet, but nevertheless feels thor- |
oughly satisfied with. Good enter- '
tainment, and the bus scenes are ty- i
pical, if not comfortable.
