# OTIS COPS FIRST IN NET LADDER
## 
### 
Running true to form, Chuck Otis,
Sam Lee, and Johnny Law have re
tained the first three places on the
Card tennis varsity thus far in lad
der matches.
In four matches played last week,
Law first turned back- the deter
mined bid of Glen Reed for number
three position, defeating him in three
sets, after Reed had won the first in
surprisingly easy fashion.
Earlier, Law had challenged Leo,
and this match also resulted in a
three set fight before Lee's experi
ence won over Law's steady play,
and he retained the number two
place.
On Friday afternoon Lee and Otis
met to decide ihe number one posi
tion on the squad. Captain Otis,
barely recovered from a twisted lig
ament, played excellent tennis, to
down Lee, holder of the Intercolle
giate doubles crown, in two compar
atively easy sets. Lee could ba*-ly
cope with the speed of Otis' service,
while his forehand and backhand
shots won point after point from
Lee. However, the bespectacled
player has been practicing for only
three weeks, will undoubtedly be a
threat to any number two confcrence
player when the season begins.
Journeying to San Francisco, Lee
and Otis met Gerry Stratford and
Dick Blasgower in the second of
their practice doubles matches Sat
urday afternoon. Final scores were:
7-5, 6-1, 3-6, 6-4, with the college
netmen playing smooth doubles.
