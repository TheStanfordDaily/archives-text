# GOLF MATCH WON BY DON EDWARDS
## 
### 
With the playoff for the third posi- i
tion on the varsity golf team carne !
some of the most perfect golf of the !
year thus far. Don Edwards de- j
feated Dick Giddings by a two and j
one margin only by virtue of a 73. j
Giddings had a 74.
The match was truly brilliant al- ;
though Edwards at times seemed |
preoccupied; Giddings was quick to
take advantage of any and all lapses |
on the part of Edwards.
In the playoffs in the lesser lad
der positions, Tom Dwyer defeated j
Dan Moser for the seventh position, j
Moser then dropped a ladder match j
to Erskine.
At the lower end of the ladder
Hugh Mellon has provided the fire- ;
works while little Sten Shepperd has j
seen the greatest amount of action, j
Mellon started of! the lower lad
der by challenging and defeating!
Sten Shepperd to take the tenth i
place. Bueter, the winner of the
playoff for the twelfth place, chal
lenged and was defeated by Sten j
Shepperd.
During the coming week matches I
between Edwards and Hoerner, â€¢
Thompson and Hoelle, and Mellon I
and Dan M3ser will provide plenty ;
excitement.
