# PUBLIC SCHOOL AID NECESSARY STATES SEARS
## School Finance Authority Thinks Maldistribution Cause of Burden STATE CONTROL MAN Federal Aid Necessary For Permanent Tax Relief 
### Emerson Honan 
Federal aid far the public school is
a necessity, but such aid should not
imply Federal control of the school
system, according to Dr. Jesse Brun
dage Sears, Stanford professor of
education. Dr. Sears, a national au
thority on school finance, last night
gave the fifth in the series of educa
tional talks sponsored by the Uni
versity and presented every Mon
day evening over radio station KPO.
American schools arc in desperate
need of help, continued Dr. Sears,
as the cost of schools is growing and
will continue to grow if the people
are to continue the present standard
of living in Ihe face of such prob
lems as unemployment, child labor,
and public health.
Costs a Burden
School costs are unevenly distrib
uted and are a heavy burden on j
thousands of school districts. This I
is a result of an antiquated tax sys- i
tem and a worn out system of school
organization and finance. Recent
trends in the ratio of school costs to
wealth and earnings indicate that j
future equality of educational op
portunity for everyone will make
Federal aid an absolute necessity.
Federal help is now available for
the schools, but this emergency re
lief must be made permanent, in the
opinion of Dr. Sears. It should come
through enlai'goment of the present
service and by financial help, the
latter to be granted as an outright
gift to the state with no restricting
conditions.
Should Be Equalized
Money given to the states should
be determined by a formula de
signed to equalize education costs in
the various districts, in terms of a
minimum standard program of edu- |
cation.
"America should never give up
the principle of state control of ed
ucation," said Dr. Sears, "nor the j
idea that the f chool is essentially a ,
local enterprise in character. In ac- j
cepting aid, therefore, support and |
control must part company."
