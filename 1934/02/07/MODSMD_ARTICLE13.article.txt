# Testament Discarded; Class Brews Coffee
## 
### 
From 7 to 9 o'clock is too long to j
read the New Testament. At least i
that's what members of Dr. E. W.
Martin's Monday night Greek class i
thought. Enterprising, original stu
dents provided an electric percola
tor, cake, tea, and coffee, took time
off in the middle of the class to pre- 1
pare food, then perserved further in
the Acts of the Apostles, drinking
coffee, smoking cigarettes.
