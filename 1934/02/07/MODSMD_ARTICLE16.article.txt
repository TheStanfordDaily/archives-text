# Greeks Vote to Create Tarver Memorial Fund
## Interfraternity Council Will Reward Progress In Row Scholarship 
### George Wilson 
A substantial * financial award,
known as the Bruce M. Tarver me
morial scholarship, will be presented
each year by the Interfraternity
Council, it was decided in a council
meeting last night.
This will be awarded to the house
showing the greatest scholastic
achievement during the year, based
on its absolute point average, and
the advance in rank during the year.
The house, in turn, will award the
fund to three or less men, on the
basis of scholastic merit and financial
need. The scholarship can only be
awarded subject to the approval of
the Scholarship Committee of the
council.
Tatum States Aim
"It is with the definite aim of im
proving the general fraternity schol
arship that we have adopted this
plan," declared Interfraternity
Chairman Donn Tatum. "The com
mittee has devoted much time to
formulating a plan by which all
houses can have an equal chance to
share in the award.
"The plan as adopted is the fairest
possible, giving equal weight to the
scholastic ranking of the house, and
the improvement over the year."
A house, to be eligible for com
petition, must have a rating equal
to or better lhan the fraternity
scholastic average for the preceding
year. The plan will go into effect
next fall, and the first award will be
made at the end of that year.
Tarver Lauded
In dedicating the scholarship to
Tarver, the council acted in appre
ciation of the fact that he "was an
outstanding ideal of a fraternity man,
was always interested in activities
of this sort, and devoted much time
snct constructive criticisms to the
plan when it was started last year."
Wednesday night was set as the
time for pledges to eat dinner at
their respective houses, following the
customs set last year. The purpose
of this action is to standardize the
number at Encina each nigh f , for the
benefit of the Commons management
â€”and rebates.
