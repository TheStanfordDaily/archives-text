# BOYNTON GREEN TALKS TONIGHT ON ENGINEERING
## Lower Division Students To Hear Veteran Teacher In Little Theatre 
### 
Professor Boynton Morris Green,
associate professor of mechanical
engineering at Stanford since 1921,
will speak at 7:15 o'clock this eve
ning in the Little Theatre before
lower division students and others
interested in the School of Engi
neering on the selections of that
school for their University work.
"The man who is going to do best
in engineering is the one who likes
it so well he cannot keep away from
it," said Green in explaining who he
thought ought to enter the field of
engineering.
Engineering Course Hard
He stressed that it is an arduous
course and a hard grind, especially
for the student who is not thoroughly
keen about the subject. Professor
Green, however, went on to explain
that an engineering course is good
for a general knowledge because of
its training in the habit of thought.
"Some students take engineering
for the critical and intelligent rea
soning matter involved," he said, and
gave illustrations of former engi
neering students who have entered
the wholesale and retail grocery
business.
Stanford Graduate
Born in Rochester, N.Y., Professor
Green came out to California early

and construction engineer in the
Federal' Telegraph Company. He
joined the Stanford faculty in 1920
and has been here regularly since
1921.
Served in Army
Professor Green represented his
most interesting engineering expe
rience as that of a reserve officer in
the ordinance department of the
United States Army, which is the
mechanical engineering branch in
charge of manufacturing and testing
rifles, cannons, ammunition, and ex
plosives. He was made a lieutenant
commissioner in 1926 and captain in

keen about the subject. Professor
Green, however, went on to explain
that an engineering course is good
for a general knowledge because of
its training in the habit of thought.
"Some students take engineering
for the critical and intelligent rea
soning matter involved," he said, and
gave illustrations of former engi
neering students who have entered
the wholesale and retail grocery
business.
Stanford Graduate
Born in Rochester, N.Y., Professor
Green came out to California early
in life and looked forward to coming
to Stanford since his grammar school
days. He was granted an A.B. de
gree at Stanford in 1914 and an En
gineer degree two years later.
In 1916 he was student engineer
at H. Koppers Company in 'Pitts
burgh, Penn., one of the largest en
gineering plants in the East. In 1917
and from 1919-21 he was draftsman
and construction engineer in the
Federal' Telegraph Company. He
joined the Stanford faculty in 1920
and has been here regularly since
1921.
Served in Army
Professor Green represented his
most interesting engineering expe
rience as that of a reserve officer in
the ordinance department of the
United States Army, which is the
mechanical engineering branch in
charge of manufacturing and testing
rifles, cannons, ammunition, and ex
plosives. He was made a lieutenant
commissioner in 1926 and captain in
1930.
Time for the series of mijor de
partment lectux-es has been changed
to 7:15-8:15 o'clock for the conven
ience of students who work or for
other reasons cannot attend at 7
o'clock.
Professor Boynton Morris Green,
associate professor of mechanical
engineering at Stanford since 1921,
will speak at 7:15 o'clock this eve
ning in the Little Theatre before
lower division students and others
interested in the School of Engi
neering on the selections of that
school for their University work.
"The man who is going to do best
in engineering is the one who likes
it so well he cannot keep away from
it," said Green in explaining who he
thought ought to enter the field of
engineering.
Engineering Course Hard
He stressed that it is an arduous
course and a hard grind, especially
for the student who is not thoroughly
keen about the subject. Professor
