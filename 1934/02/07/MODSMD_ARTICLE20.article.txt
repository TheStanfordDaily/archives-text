# A.S.S.U. Vote to Decide Fate of Rooters' Stunts
## 
### 
Do you favor retention or aboli- '
j tion of card stunts?
This question will appear on A.S.
j S.U. election ballots Tuesday, as a
! result of unanimous action taken at j
| last night's Rally Committee meet
| ing
; The vote will be taken to deter
i mirie the student attitude on the j
! much-discussed question of abolish- j
i ing or retaining football game
| stunts, raised by the Daily last fall, ;
j argued over by sports writers,
j With campus circles still discuss- j
[ ing the moot question, the vote is ;
j expected to settle disputes and de
j cide whether or not plana of rally
| men for next fall will include the j

colored pasteboards used many years
in Stanford sections.
"We will abide by the decision of
the students in this matter," said
Head Rallyman Stan Beaubaire last
night. "The Rally Committee wishes
to be impartial in this matter and
we did not feel that we should at
tempt to judge such a question af
fecting all the students. Hence the
vote."
Arguments: pro, that stunts add
to the real coilegiate atmosphere of
a game, that ticket .sales increase in
direct ratio. Con, that stunts are
worn out, that the Stanford section
is too small to be effective, that field
stunts or whole-stadium yells would
be better.
