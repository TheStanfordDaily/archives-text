## Applause Greets Efforts Of Walter Gieseking 
### Barbara Sweet 
Combining delicacy of touch and
fullness of tone throughout his ad
mirably assorted program, Walter
Gieseking last night elicited thun
derous applause from an enthusias
tic audience filling the Pavilion.
Jerking his leonine head and
swaying on his stool, tnis tall, hulk
ing man drew forth tones of such
sweet and mellow smoothness that
his listeners were astonished. Com
pletely at ease, his fingers rippled
across the keys swiftly and surely,
each note well-rounded despite the
delicate precision with which it was
played.
His interpretation of the Beethoven
A Major Sonata was especially note
worthy. At no time affecting dra
matic thundering, he reached his
powerful climax in the final move
ment without once forcing a tone.
Throughout he merged himself with
the spirit of the composer, conveying
all of Beethoven's fantasy and feel
ing with rare sensitiveness.
Of the Deßussy numbers, perhaps
the most popular on the program,
the final two. ''Reflets dans l'eau"
and "Poissons d'Or," were particu
larly well received.
When Gies2king played these two
selections in one of his New York
concerts recently, Critic Olin Downs
said of his rendition: "Extreme ex
actitude in following the composer's
indications was tempered by an ac
companying institution for the in
tention that the creator of the music
could only partly express by signs
on the printed page."
Financially successful, the con
cert's receipts far surpassed the $250
figure alloied it in the Concert Se
ries' budget. The fact that this per
formance netted such an unexpected
profit practically assures the Concert
Series a balanced ledger for the
1933-34 season. The final concert
will be given by Rosa Ponselle on
April 10.
