# ANOTHER FRENCH REVOLUTION?
## 
### 
Twelve people have been killed and 1,100 have been
injured in Parisian riots. The press calls it a revolution
but the press calls three jabbering communists on the cor
ner of Howard and Third streets in San Francisco a com
munis! uprising, so at this date it is impossible to tell ex
actly what may result from Ihe French slew if Ihe French
eal stew.
II is interesting to note that nil this excitement, and
5,100 injured can be called excitement, arose over a gov
ernmental scandal involving only a few million dollars.
Here in America, where money is cheap and political in
tegrity is easy-going, Mr. John Public would probably
hardly have grumbled its he scanned the "graft" headlines
on liis hurried way to Ihe sports page.
The Teapot Dome Scandal which robbed the public of
many times the amount garnered by Staviskv created
much less excitement here. In fact, the same party that
allowed Ihe affair was re-elected bv the largest majority it
had received up to that time. The only widespread reac
tion was: Why wasn't I in there getting mine? Hut such is
A nierica.
If the French riots would only end as they had begun
over a financial scandal, there would be little to consider,
but there is much evidence that the present ruckus will
end in a Fascist government for France. The war-dogs in
France have been muzzled by thrifty French governments
for too long.
Should a fire-eating Fascism like that found in Ger
many or Italy be instituted in France, it is hard to say what
would happen. While objecting to foreign travelers who
return from three months in Europe convinced that a war
will break out after supper Friday or by Saturday break
fast at the very latest, there is no doubt that a militant
Fascism in France would be very likely to cause a Franco-
Crcrman war. What that would cause, one shudders to
imagine. Hut a little shuddering every now and then is a
good thing.
The world has a very material interest in whether the
Paris riots over pawn-shops develop into another French
revolu I ion.
