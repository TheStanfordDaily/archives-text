# The 						Way to Fame and Glory

Yesterday, a nice little tÂ»irl sat on the Law Steps writing
or trying to write in her notebook, while half the Law
School clapped feverishly and the rest of the Quad inhabi
tants stared hard and laughed loudly.
Then, in one of those rare moments of ego maximation,
up she stood, and looking neither to the right nor the left,
departed from the steps. She had scored an incident. Hers
was the center of the stage, upstage, downstage in fact
the whole stage.
This little miss had broken ;i Stanford tradition. She
had elevated herself above I lie binding customs that so
hamper the herd of humanity. She no doubt realizes that
traditions are a simple thing, based on no scientific facts
or sociological standards. She was a free woman; a mod
ern woman free of the restrictions Stanford men had
placed on her sex from time immemorial.
At other universities, they have committees to enforce
traditions. Thev are called Sophomore Service Commit
tees or something of the like. They snoop around and
catching underclassmen violating school traditions, they
mete out summary "justice." Women are made to lake
oil' their' makeup and kindred horrible punishments.
Men are given more primitive treatment.
May Stanford never fall to such depths. If the students
do not wish to abide by school traditions, that should be
their business. We have always enjoyed the little folklore
that attached to no smoking on the Quad, no women on
the Law Steps, and no underclassmen in cords.
We do not think the I diversity will fall to the sand
stone dust from which it sprang if traditions are broken;
but if they go, a tear for their leaving, and a lusty laugh
for those w ho swell their ego bv publicly breaking them.
