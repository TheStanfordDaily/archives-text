# Like the Flowers in Spring

II is ;i well known pari of Ihe frontiersman's lore that
il is impossible lo tell exactly where the next spring flower
will pop. And Stanford caucus life seems to have copied
I lie spring Mowers.
The freshmen held a political powwow last night. This,
with the Row caucus this noon at the Sigma Nil house, will
make three caucuses. Though it may he true, as some
daini, that the freshman interest in politics was inspired
from above, il is slill political interest. And political in
lerest is a fine thing just like the spring flowers.
The purpose of the caucus system is to limit the number
of candidates which is almost a necessity under the pref
erential system of voting. We hope therefore that the
caucus mania does not spread. We might have a caucus
for each class; parts of classes might hold their own; red
heads might meet together; there is no end of possibilities.
Only tin 4 ingenuity of man would end theni. And man's
ingenuity is very great.
It this caucus thing went far enough, we might elect
men on how many caucuses they could carry and dispense
with the election enlirelv.*
