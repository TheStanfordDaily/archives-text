# CAMPUS OPINION
## REST IN PEACE! REST IN SILENCE! REST! 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
We're tired. Tired of fighting
against something that we sincerely
believe and know to be wrong. 1 '
guess it doesn't pay to use reason
against emotion. We tried to make !
the campus see that Cap and Gown
was a misrepresentation. We let ,
ourselves be an open target for criti
cism—they thought and think us i
publicity seekers and that we had I
ulterior political motives. Can't they
see that we would have had so much ;
nicer and cleaner publicity by
marching around in our black l-obes,
showing off our superitority, giving
teas, and wearing our black pins?
Instead we have lost many friends, 1
we've been insulted publicly and
privately and we've had mud thrown
in our faces generally.
Now for the last time we appeal to
Ihe campus to think, not feel.
If Cap and Gown had decided to
be ;x nice congenial group of girls, i
that wanted contact with interesting
alumni, we would have let them
have their tea parties. But they
don't. They are parading under false j
pretenses and ideals. They consider
themselves the one and only high i
and mighty honorary society on the
campus, with a scholarship require
ment, an activities requirement, and
a character (?) requirement. They
consider themselves beyond re- j
proach and without equal.
They expect to honor, and are
honored, sad as it may seem, by !
the campus. And why? Partly be- |
cause the campus hasn't known in
the past, the ugly facts; partly be
cause the campus doesn't think, it
accepts, and partly because we let
our emotions run away with our ;
heads. » i

And now they've had another elec
tion—an election entirely unjusti
fied. Two of the new members do
r.ot have the required scholarship
average, a majority are not outstand
ing in activities, and you must agree
that the subjective basis of selection,
character, is unmeaijurable and ab
suid. We also heard stated in a Cap
and Gown meeting last quarter that
Cap and Govvri could rise above the
influence of politics, personal preju
dice, and spile. Think of those per
sons that were not taken last night
who had the required scholarship
and activities, and who must have
been left off because of character?
Character is Cap and Gown's loop
hole for letting politics, spite, and
dislikes come in. And since Cap and
Gown is not abiding by their scholar
ship requirements, think of those
persons that were not taken who had
outstanding activities?
And last, but not least, rvas the
false rumor false? Did anyone see
the traditional black gowns in the
eating halls last night? Cap and
Gown was not only unwilling to bid
new members in public, but they
were unwilling to march them
around and show them in public.
Why? You can see the obvious an
swer, but maybe their answer would
be that they aren't seeking publicity
and praise. Then why the front page
story with the list of names, the
beautiful purpose, and the pretenti
ous basis of selection?
Au revoir, Cap and Gown. We've
flung our last stone, and may you
rest in peace.
Yes, I'll sign my name and get
more mud in the face.
Babe Dear,
Ex-President, Cap and Gown.

the campus. And why? Partly be- |
cause the campus hasn't known in
the past, the ugly facts; partly be
cause the campus doesn't think, it
accepts, and partly because we let
our emotions run away with our ;
heads. » i

And now they've had another elec
tion—an election entirely unjusti
fied. Two of the new members do
r.ot have the required scholarship
average, a majority are not outstand
ing in activities, and you must agree
that the subjective basis of selection,
character, is unmeaijurable and ab
suid. We also heard stated in a Cap
and Gown meeting last quarter that
Cap and Govvri could rise above the
influence of politics, personal preju
dice, and spile. Think of those per
sons that were not taken last night
who had the required scholarship
and activities, and who must have
been left off because of character?
Character is Cap and Gown's loop
hole for letting politics, spite, and
dislikes come in. And since Cap and
Gown is not abiding by their scholar
ship requirements, think of those
persons that were not taken who had
outstanding activities?
And last, but not least, rvas the
false rumor false? Did anyone see
the traditional black gowns in the
eating halls last night? Cap and
Gown was not only unwilling to bid
new members in public, but they
were unwilling to march them
around and show them in public.
Why? You can see the obvious an
swer, but maybe their answer would
be that they aren't seeking publicity
and praise. Then why the front page
story with the list of names, the
beautiful purpose, and the pretenti
ous basis of selection?
Au revoir, Cap and Gown. We've
flung our last stone, and may you
rest in peace.
Yes, I'll sign my name and get
more mud in the face.
Babe Dear,
Ex-President, Cap and Gown.
The Editor, Sir:
We're tired. Tired of fighting
against something that we sincerely
believe and know to be wrong. 1 '
guess it doesn't pay to use reason
against emotion. We tried to make !
the campus see that Cap and Gown
was a misrepresentation. We let ,
ourselves be an open target for criti
cism—they thought and think us i
publicity seekers and that we had I
ulterior political motives. Can't they
see that we would have had so much ;
nicer and cleaner publicity by
marching around in our black l-obes,
showing off our superitority, giving
teas, and wearing our black pins?
Instead we have lost many friends, 1
we've been insulted publicly and
privately and we've had mud thrown
in our faces generally.
Now for the last time we appeal to
Ihe campus to think, not feel.
If Cap and Gown had decided to
be ;x nice congenial group of girls, i
that wanted contact with interesting
alumni, we would have let them
have their tea parties. But they
don't. They are parading under false j
pretenses and ideals. They consider
themselves the one and only high i
and mighty honorary society on the
campus, with a scholarship require
ment, an activities requirement, and
a character (?) requirement. They
consider themselves beyond re- j
proach and without equal.
They expect to honor, and are
honored, sad as it may seem, by !
the campus. And why? Partly be- |
cause the campus hasn't known in
the past, the ugly facts; partly be
cause the campus doesn't think, it
accepts, and partly because we let

heads. » i
