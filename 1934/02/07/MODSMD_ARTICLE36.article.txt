The Editor, Sir:
Stanford gentlemen, manhood has
been defiled!
Yesterday at 11 o'clock Stanford's
holy of holies was sullied by the
body of a ' certain plump female
wearing Red Sen. Physical removal
of the intruder was impossible un
der any prevailing standard of gen
tlemanliness; she brazenly resisted
notification of her error by the usual
handclappings with mule-like stub
bornness, and remained planted and
unmoved for such a period of time
that her presence can be interpreted
as nothing less than deliberately in
tentional.
The issue is clear, gentlemen, this
ghastly sacrilidge can not be re
peated.
Over the last 200 years man has
suffered women to rise from the
status of mere chattel property and
has seen her climax, her liberty and
equality in the person of that nau
seating individual—the American
Club Woman. Woman has invaded
the barber shop with like brazenness
and the demise of the once noble
sanctionary of the cigar is not far off.
Gentlemen, now is the time to re
trench. The suffrance of "Equality"
has gone far enough. The University
may have rank to the status of a
gigolo, but the Law Steps must for
ever remain sacred.
They shall not pass,
Ed. Boyles
