# Another Teapot Dome?
## 
### 
A scandal comparable to the "Tea
pot Dome" affair is more than likely
to grow out of the present Senate
investigation of army and air mail
contracts for planes, motors and
general equipment. Pacific Coast
aii man Boeing admitted making nine
millions in 1928 by investing $259.
Quiz also revealed a whole nest
of aircraft lobbyists with salaries
langing from $25,000 to $3,000. Big
stuff is expected soon with Hoover
Republicans figuring more than
Democrats.
