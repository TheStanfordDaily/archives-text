STANFORD TRIES
A NEW ANGLE
Beginning mudestly enough, Stan
ford will hold its first invitational
high school basketball tournament
here in March. The idea may be
credited to Coach John Bunn of the
Indians, who has fostered hopes of
such an affair since his advent here
in 1931. If successful, it is planned
to perpetuate it, bringing the cream
of the high school teams here yearly,
until it may possibly develop to the
stage where high school tournaments
now are in the middle-west.
There, they fairly drag 'em in by
the heels at the turnstiles, and
nightly capacity crowds with the ul
timate in entertainment and excite
ment akin to the old circus days are
the rule.
THEREBY PRODDING
CORRESPONDENTS
But when the B.A.C. scheduled
their big high school blowout for
March 9 and 10, they little cared
what their prank was to cost the
hardworking press correspondents,
that feverish-browed clan who can
be spotted most any Saturday after
noon these days by the wild look in
their eyes, the wads of copy paper in
their hip pockets, and the shuffling
walk with which they hasten from
the diamond to the tennis courts to
the swimming and vice versa.
For a look at the sports calendar
discloses that already for Saturday,
March 10, we will have rugby—Brit
ish Columbia vs. a United Union
team; swimming—U.C. vs. the var
sity plus a frosh game; baseball—St.
Mary's vs. the varsity, and the frosh
play Lowell High; track—the Ala
meda County All-Stars vs. the frosh;
tennis—Berkeley Tennis Club meets
Ihe frosh; basketball—eight high
school league champions and all their
howling cohorts going through four
or five games daily.
AND THE OLD
GRAD GETS AN EAR
And to J.P.. ex-'29, who was kind
enough to write in—Thanks for the
good word and you're right—rugby
is about tops for the friendly asso
ciations among the players and
hangers-on that it develops; and
everyone likes to practice almost as
well as to play it; we think the
squad is looking forward to giving
the British Columbia team a good
time and a good licking when they
come down, the good time of course
being the most important thiiig.
Really, though, we're all for this
basketball squad and had a column
o that effect written and kicking
'und the office all last week when
1 v/as so much news in sports
(here was simply no room for
\Vhen a coach can take a gang
.ng, floppity, pea-green bunch of
kids and make the fairly smooth
working (in spite of the Cal defeat)
team that they now are, hats are off
to both the men and the coach.
J.P. reminds us that Swede Righ
ter, former coach of C.0.P., has been
around all fall working the gradu
ate school. Swede was captain of the
only two Stanford teams to whip
California and win the Coast title.
He did good work at C.O.P. and was
right up among 'em every year.
