# DEADLY SHOOTING OF STAR FORWARD HELPS U.C. CAUSE
## 
### 
Led by high scoring Captain Hal
Eifert, California's Golden Bear
leads the pack in the race for lias- j
ketball honors of the southern divi- 1
sion ol the Pacific Coast Confer
ence, due to its victory over Stan- i
ford Saturday night.

The Bears have suffered but one
defeat, that at the hands of Sam
Barry's Barking Trojans who rest
in second place. The L.A. home
forces seem unable to cause much
trouble for U.S.C. as their two de
feats have been at the hands of their
two northern opponents, California
and Stanford. In the first two games
of the annual Los Angeles "civil
war" series, U.C.L.A. didn't even
threaten the walls of Troy.
Play Well in South
Stanford's best basketball seems to
be played in the South. At any rate,
the two Indian victories have been
accomplished in Los Angeles, the
first against U.C.L.A. and the second
the surprising upset of the Trojans
two weeks ago.
Eifert, with his 16 points Saturday
evening, took the lead in the south
ern division scoring race with 78
digits, one ahead of S.C.'s "Rubber
Legs" Guttero. Ernie Holbrook, Tro
jan forward, jumped to third place
with 53 points ahead of Indian Keith
Topping and Dave Meek, California,
neither of whom were able to hit
the hoop Saturday.
Topping Leads Meek
Topping has 49 points to IVleek's
44. Last year's high scorer, Captain
Don Piper of U.C.L.A., is holding
down sixth place this year with 43
points to date.
This week-end may see changes
in conference standings with U.S.C.
meeting California in Los Angeles
and the Bruins traveling North to
the Farm for a two-game series.
