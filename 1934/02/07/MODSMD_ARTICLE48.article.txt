# Coast Conference Agrees On Scholarship Problem
## 
### 
An agreement, proposed by U.S.C.,
whereby private schools of the Pa
cific Coast Conference will require
payment of $25 from all students re
ceiving athletic scholarships was
reached at the last minute of the
Pacific Coast Conference.
The agreement will equalize con
ditions for private and state schools.
The $25 stipulation equals the regis
tration fee at the University of Cali
fornia. The "gentlemen's" agreement
was advanced by Southern Califor
nia in order to permit California to
offer equal advantage to prospective
students. Since California requires
a non-resident fee of $150, it was
agreed that private schools also re
quire this fee of athletes wio have
been awarded scholarships.
Kules providing that not more than
50 per cent of scholarships given by
any school may be awarded to ath
letes are already effective in the
Conference.

Los Angeles is passing stringent
building restrictions to make all
edifices earthquake-proof.
