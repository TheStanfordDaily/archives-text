# Novice Golf Quota Fills
## 
### 
I The novice golf tournament has |
| revived the interest of the half-way
j man. The number of recent entries
1 in the tournament shows that: To- i
| day's total of eight, entries raises the
j total entry list to about twenty to
' date.
It is Coach Twiggs' hope to have ,
! in excess of thirty-two in the field
; before the end of the week. The !
; qualifying will end Saturday night. !
j The limit has to be extended to in- j
J elude Saturday play.
The regulations governing the en- (
I try into the tournament have been
! liberalized to the extent that they
! allow all campus golfers who are not
! medal or cup winners or members j
J of the present f/eshman and varsity j
j free lists to play.
| As a trophy Coach Twiggs has do- j
j nated a set of Hagen woods of the j
' latest model. They are steel shafted j
i and have a brass inlay in the face.
