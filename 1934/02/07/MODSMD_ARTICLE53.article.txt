# BIG LEAGUE STARS MEET VARSITY NINE
## 
### Chuck Clancy 
A galaxy of Coast and big league
ball players, comprising the Kenealy
Seals, will invade the Farm tomor
row to do battle with the Stanford
varsity nine on the Sunken diamond
at 3:15 o'clock.
This redoubtable collection of stars
will probably be the best the Cards
will face all season and Coach Wol
ter's men will have to extend them
selves to the utmost to win.
Wolter has decided to make one
drastic change in his starting lineup
in an effort to bolster the strength
of the Stanford infield. Ray For
syth, who made his letter last year
in the outfield, but who has been
working at short and second since
the beginning of the fall quarter, will
start at this post. Forsyth, while
not as flashy as Galbraith and Clark,
is steady on the field and a hard
hitter at the plate.
Fred Heringer will make his first
start of the season on the mound.
The starting lineup: Hamilton, If;
Miles, cf; Nutting, rf; Tremaine or
Trautman, 3b; Woolley, 2b; Hearn or
Grayson, lb; Forsyth, ss; Heringer,
p; Massey, c.
