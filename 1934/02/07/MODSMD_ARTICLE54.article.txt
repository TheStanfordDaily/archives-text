# Thompson Beats Hoelle In Tight Golf Clash
## 
### 
That Stanford will send the best
golf team in their history into the
California matches this year is al
most a certainty, judging from re
cent developments. Bill Hoelle and
Bob Thompson took care of this yes
terday when, in a ladder match for
the fifth position on the team,
Thompson shot a 73 and defeated
Hoelle by but two strokes.
Hoelle's sixth place 75 assures the
team of a finer balance of power than
it has had for a long time. This
means that the men capable of shoot
ing below 75 extend past the middle
of the first string.

i Gus Arnheim moves to the St.
{Francis soon, with Ben Bernie ex
pected to arrive on the Coast in
March.
