# POLO TEAM LEAVES FOR CORVALLIS SERIES TODAY
## 
### 
Stanford's crack polo team entrains toduy for Corvallis, Oregon, where
j Captain Gordon's men take on the hard-riding Oregon State mallet wielders
Thursday and Saturday in a two-game series. The matches will be played
indoors with three men, instead of the usual outdoor four, comprising a
; team.
Oregon State will have an advantage over the Cards for these games
will mark the first appearance of the Stanford polo players on an indoor
5 arena.
Four men, Luppen, Fullerton, Rogers, and Rasmussen, are slated to
j make the trip. They will return to the campus next Monday.
Following the Oregon State series the Stanford poloists will settle down
to intensive practice preparing for the Arizona U. series scheduled to be
{ played here February 23 and 24. These matches will probably be the
closest of the season as Arizona will bring a team here which holds the
| only victories scored against the Cards for several years.
Following the Arizona-Stanford series, both teams will depart for Los
I Angeles where they will appear in another match.
Little is known of the calibre of the Oregon State mallet-wielders, for
they have not yet played any of Stanford's opponents. However, the
Beavers have been outstanding in every .sport in which they have engaged
! with other Pacific Coast teams, and they may be expected to give the In
, dians a hard fight.
The Arizona game in Los Angeles, fifth in the series between the two
leading western polo teams, will probably develop into the official inter
collegiate championship game of the Pacific Coast. In the two games yluyed
in Arizona, Stanford surprised itself and opponents by winning the first
I match, and putting up a stirring battle in the second.
