# "Y" Tea Today for House Mothers, Hall Directors
## 
### 
Directors of living units and house
mothers on the campus are invited
to attend a tea today from 4:30 to
5:30 o'clock in the "Y" rooms of the
Women's Clubhouse. The advisory
board of the student committee of
the Y.W.C.A. are sponsoring the tea.
Refreshments will be served by
the social committee, and all "Y"
girls are urged to assist in serving.

Oregon's state board of education
rejected a proposal of University of
Oregon students to make member
ship in the student body optional
lather than compulsory.
