NOTES ON A DRAMATIC TYPE
A Glance at Folk Drama
I have taken occasion in the past
to deprecate much of that body of
American dramatic writing which is
referred to vaguely as "folk" drama
—that is to say, the play in dialect
which purports to be a picture of
existence in some particular section
of the nation — most frequently a
view of rural existence.
It would be wise to suggest at
once that the matter in itself is by
no means an impossible basis for
good drama, as well as the fact that
a few undeniably fine examples are
to be found in the American drama.
Nevertheless it remains fairly ob
vious that the great bulk of such
writing either fails to fulfill the es
sential demands of the theatre or is
merely an artificial imposition.
Of that latter sort is Lynn Riggs'
"Green Grow the Lilacs." In reality
it is a rather foolish melodrama
which possesses any "folk"' quality
only because of Riggs' inclusion of
authentic cowboy songs which are
themselves pleasant but dramatically
redundant. His employment of pe
culiar folk customs is equally ar
bitrary and scarcely affects the es
sential quality of the play itself.
This is not a reflection upon the play
as a melodrama, but upon the play
as folk drama. It is lacking in ele
ments. With a change of songs and
dialect it might equally well be set
in mid-Sibei'ia.
Further, there is the "folk"' play
which fails as drama because the
writer, lacking the essentials of the
dramatist and possessing either no
genuine talent or a talent not neces
sarily dramatic in itself, creates a

| tedious series of scenes whichitell a
i realistic story but do not produce
a play.
A majority of the plays of Faul :
| Green are dramatic nonentities of
this sort, failing in every dramatic
demand. Such a play as his "In
Abraham's Bosom" is further com
plicated by the author's preoccupa
tion with a "problem" which he
states with insistence, but with the
rhetorical insistence of the lecture
! platform rather than that of the !
1
l stage.
There is, too, the ,writer whose
talent is poetic rather than drama
tic, but employs the latter form for
his expression. I hesitate to name
Dan Totheroh in this latter group,
• and the quality of such another
1 writer as Susan Glaspell is of too
1 dubiously poetical and insistently
feminine a nature to encourage her i
I inclusion at all. But a glance at the i
Irish dramatists will reveal the sing- i
i ers of songs whose tone is unmis
lakably and exclusively ihat of their
native land while their dramas be
i
come peopled with highly conceived
symbols rather than living persons.
This is no doubt that the writing
1 of folk drama is a difficult and pecu-
I liarly restricted task, full of pitfalls j
and beset by ruffianly tempters. But
a fine folk drama, one which is at
once genuinely of the earth and of
the people, whose characters are in
! dividuals but possessing the neces- 5
| sary universality which the folk
| drama demands, is a possession to be,
i cherished and one which offers a
| thrilling and lasting experience in,
! the theatre. That is why "The Green
! Pastures" is an exceedingly irnpor-
I tant play. —Sandoe

NOTES ON A DRAMATIC TYPE
A Glance at Folk Drama
I have taken occasion in the past
to deprecate much of that body of
American dramatic writing which is
referred to vaguely as "folk" drama
—that is to say, the play in dialect
which purports to be a picture of
existence in some particular section
of the nation — most frequently a
view of rural existence.
It would be wise to suggest at
once that the matter in itself is by
no means an impossible basis for
good drama, as well as the fact that
a few undeniably fine examples are
to be found in the American drama.
Nevertheless it remains fairly ob
vious that the great bulk of such
writing either fails to fulfill the es
sential demands of the theatre or is
merely an artificial imposition.
Of that latter sort is Lynn Riggs'
"Green Grow the Lilacs." In reality
it is a rather foolish melodrama
which possesses any "folk"' quality
only because of Riggs' inclusion of
authentic cowboy songs which are
themselves pleasant but dramatically
redundant. His employment of pe
culiar folk customs is equally ar
bitrary and scarcely affects the es
sential quality of the play itself.
This is not a reflection upon the play
as a melodrama, but upon the play
as folk drama. It is lacking in ele
ments. With a change of songs and
dialect it might equally well be set
in mid-Sibei'ia.
Further, there is the "folk"' play
which fails as drama because the
writer, lacking the essentials of the
dramatist and possessing either no
genuine talent or a talent not neces
sarily dramatic in itself, creates a

| tedious series of scenes whichitell a
i realistic story but do not produce
a play.
