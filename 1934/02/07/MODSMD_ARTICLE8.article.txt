# HALL PETITION ASKS REVISION OF DANCE RULE
## Open House Privilege Given Row Men, Cited As Discrimination AUTHORITIES SCORED Toyon Dance Speeds Action Against Wilbur Stand 
### Frank Orr 
Condemning the stand of the ad
ministrative manifesto issued last
week concerning the presence of
women in Hall rooms during dances
ana "resenting the inference that
they cannot behave themselves as
gentlemen," Hall residents yesterday
had prepared and were circulating a
petition to President Wilbur.
The plan proposed in the petition
provides for "open house" hours in
dormitories during hours of a recog
nized dance, permits women in
rooms if two are together, plans for
regulation by B.A.C. police in the
halls.

Open Doors

Open doors in rooms when women
are present would be required under
new regulations, following the plan
used in Roble during open house.
A feeling of discrimination
against Hall men is mentioned in
the petition, which suggests that
"the administration .... allows
the fraternities and sororities full
privileges of open house during
dances, while specifically restrict
ing the freedom of Hall men."
Addressed to Dr. Wilbur and al
ready with many signatures, the pe
tition was prompted by the immi
nence of Friday's Toyon Formal, the
dance committee arguing that the
crowded conditions on the floor
would be greatly relieved were
guests permitted in the halls and
rooms.
Mentions Ruling
Dr. Wilbur's original letter, ad
dressed to organization presidents
and given wide publicity in San
Francisco papers, called attention to
an administrative ruling made last
year at the time of the Senior Ball.
Under Dr. Wilbur's proclamation
the Comptroller will be asked to va
cate rooms entered by women during
dances, and provides that "I . . . .
will then deal with the individuals
concerned."
