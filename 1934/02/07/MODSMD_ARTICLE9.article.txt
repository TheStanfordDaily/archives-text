j Speaking on "The History of Span
i ish Painting," Senor Jose Moya del
Pino, well-known Spanish artist,
! will lecture at 4:15 o'clock this after
noon in the Little Theatre. The talk
will be illustrated by electric slides
of the artistic productions being dis
; cussed.
Del Pino has won fame as the only
! painter who has copied all the works
!of Velasquez. With Alphonso XIII,
! king of Spain, as his patron, del Pina
made an extensive study of the great
, master's works in the museums of
Europe and reproduced the complete
; series.
The collection of del Pino, since it
was finished about 10 years ago, has
i been on exhibition in many cities.
First it was displayed in Madrid,
I and, six or seven years ago, in the
Golden Gate Museum. The collec
tion is now being exhibited in the
library of the University of Califor
nia, where the pictures will prob
ably remain, for the university is
planning to buy all of them.
Beside this chief claim to recogni
tion, del Pino is notable for his por
trait paintings. He is also an author-
I ity on the history of Spanish art and
lectured on this subject for many
' years at the well-known Art Insti
tue of San Fernando in Madrid.
