## Bloody Paris 
### 
Blood again flows in the streets of j
Paris—after 145 years. Mobs are (
rioting, pillaging stores, firing inter
mittently from doorways arid sub-1
ways into police vainly attempting'
to restore order.
Martial lav/ said declared—but re
port was later denied. "The smiling
president"—Gaston Doumergue, be- |
loved of the proverbial 50,000,000 — j
has been called out of retirement to
unite the people of his country un- j
der a "strong man" —a political j
peacemaker, under whose govern- !
ment factions will be forgotten, re- !
publicans will unite solidly against 1
royalists to preserve the Third Re- ,
public—to save France from a repe- \
tition of the horrors of 1789 and a i
recurrence of free use of the bloody j
mistress.
At 1 o'clock this morning, police j
trapped a roving band of marauders
in the Boulevard Haussmann —se- |
verely beat 20 of them. Rioting is j
spreading throughout France—has j
grown serious in three provinces ad
joining Paris and Nice to the south. j

Radical le iders are still dissatis- j
fied with plans for the Doumergue
government—arc still fomenting vio
lence. The war veterans have with- |
drawn from the streets—await de- ;
vclopments. Estimates of dead run j
from 30 to 50, will probably grow j
larger. Injured list approaches 2,000. j
Many rioters last night were com
munists and common hoodlums—
bent on severe property destruc-;
tion.
