Rccent Books
His two recent books, "Editorial
Thinking and Writing," 1932, and
j "Newspaper Reporting of Public Af
| fairs," 1929, are well known authori
j ties in journalistic circles.
The former stresses the necessity
for an analysis of social data, and
is a thorough, practical guide for
j editorial writing. The latter was
hailed by Marlen Pew as "the best
| journalism textbook I ever saw,"
and portions of its chapter on "How
to Report a Criminal Trial" were
quoted in the Journal of the Ameri
can Bar Association with this com
ment:
"That such standards of accuracy
and propriety are being taught
young journalists is significant both
for the press and the public attitude
towards the administration of jus
tice."
