# Masquerading Jailbird Is Guest at Fiji House
## 
### 
Never let it be said that the Fiji's
are undemocratic. They even en
tertain ex-convicts in the guest
room of their house. At least they,
do when they believe them to be
fraternity brothers.
Desiring a bit of collegiate atmos
phere—or fraternity money—a for
mer Leavenworth and Michigan
penitentiaries inmate called at the
Phi Gamma Delta house to spend
the evening. After fondly perusing
the names in the membership book,
the guest introduced himself as Al
len Le May and claimed to be a
friend of basketball coach John
Eunn.
Ever gracious fraternity brothers
welcomed Le May until curious
hosts deciding to do a bit of re
search, found that a picture of their
illustrious member Allen Le May,
well-known Chicago author, did not
resemble the visitor. Still deter
mined tn maintain a high standard
of hospitality, suspicious brothers

obliged their guest by phoning "his
friend" Bunn who told the Fiji's he
did not know Le May.
After police had been notified of
the stranger's intrusion, the man
decided that perhaps he wasn't
wanted and therefore made his de
parture. Campus police Davis and
Burns caught the man on his way
down the Row.
At the Palo Alto police station
where he was held for questioning
and released yesterday, the man,
giving the names William Baker
and Frederick Bombard, admitted
having served a total of 11 years
in penitentiaries. He was released
from the Los Angeles jail only last
month. His father is now "doing
time" for murder, he told police.
As no charges could be proved
against the unwelcomed visitor, he
is again at large in the community.

campus coeds to take brawny boy
friends with them when going walk
