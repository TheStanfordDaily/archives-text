## Deadline for Late Payment February 13; Pay Fine Now, Says Erwin 
### 
Approximately three thousand
Stanford students, reluctant but
economical, Monday and Tuesday
deposited their various syllabus
fees.
I Just what do sums, ranging
from 50 cents to $50, do? Where
are they spent and what is, after
all, the purpose of paying out the
I sums in question?
Says E. S. Erwin, assistant comp
troller, that the aggregate amount is
; applied differently in various de
! partments, covering every conceiv
able purpose from special instruc
i tion to blue books, reading fees to
j objects used in lectures.
Lab Fees High
Elementary courses and labs come
' highest; some courses, at the more
I inviting opposite extreme, list no
j charge.
Total -university income for the
l year from this source averages ap
proximately $40,000. The current
■ quarter is expected to net an
amount in Ihc neighborhood of
$13,000.

Tuesday was the last day payable
without fine. After February 13,
registration of the procrastinating
student will be subject to cancella
tion if fees continue unpaid.
Last quarter saw unusually
prompt appearance of debtors; an
occurrence due in a minor degree
at least to the general enthusiasm
of freshman neophytes.
Extensions Granted
The few self-supporting students
who were unable to pay by the date
specified were granted extensions
by special arrangement. Erwin
urges any member of the student
body in a similar predicament this
i quarter to make arrangements with |
' the comptroller's office immediately,
| in an effort to obtain permission for
late payment.
Regarding fines — "There are a
good many, yes," confirmed Erwin.
! "A large percentage are not taken
| care of when due. On the other
hand, many are paid in advance by
mail, which I, of course, consider
the best way."
Totals received by the university
vary surprisingly from year to year,
i reveal statistics.
( Erwin urges those with debts still
outstanding to report promptly to ,
the cashier's office, second floor of
the Administration Building, and
obediently deposit their fine and fee.
"That's the easiest way," advises the
i comptroller.

Tuesday was the last day payable
without fine. After February 13,
registration of the procrastinating
student will be subject to cancella
tion if fees continue unpaid.
Last quarter saw unusually
prompt appearance of debtors; an
occurrence due in a minor degree
at least to the general enthusiasm
of freshman neophytes.
Extensions Granted
The few self-supporting students
who were unable to pay by the date
specified were granted extensions
by special arrangement. Erwin
urges any member of the student
body in a similar predicament this
i quarter to make arrangements with |
' the comptroller's office immediately,
| in an effort to obtain permission for
late payment.
Regarding fines — "There are a
good many, yes," confirmed Erwin.
! "A large percentage are not taken
| care of when due. On the other
hand, many are paid in advance by
mail, which I, of course, consider
the best way."
Totals received by the university
vary surprisingly from year to year,
i reveal statistics.
( Erwin urges those with debts still
outstanding to report promptly to ,
the cashier's office, second floor of
the Administration Building, and
obediently deposit their fine and fee.
"That's the easiest way," advises the
i comptroller.
