# Green Tells Purpose of Engineering
## Integrity, Industry, And Curiosity Assets 
### 
That the School of Engineering
prepares a student for a definite vo
cation was the view expressed by
Professor Boynton M. Green last
night as he spoke to prospective en
gineering majors and others inter
ested in engineering in the third of
Ihe series of major department lec
tures.
Professor Green, a graduate from
Stanford, has had five years of
practical engineering experience in
large industrial plants and has been
a member of the Stanford faculty in
the mechanical engineering depart
ment since 1921.
"An engineer is one who uti
lizes the forces and resources of
nature for the benefit of man
kind," said Green. He went on to
explain the various fields of en
gineering and the divisions within
those lields for which the student
engineer may train himself.
Administration and management,
consulting, design, construction and
operation, research and teaching,
and sales, he gave as the principal
types of work, and showed how the
student just out of university will
have the best chance in design or
construction work while the admin
istrative positions go to men of
many years' experience.
Solve Problems
The "main job of an engineer is
in solving problems," Professor
Green stressed. Transmission of ba
sic and factual information is also
involved in his training, however,
he explained.
Under desirable personal charac
teristics for the engineer Green
placed integrity, industry, judicial
temperament, and critical curiosity.
Following the main part of the
lecture, a number of questions were
asked by students from the floor.
Professor Green explained in an
swer to one of these that there are
some courses which one can lake
even if he is not going into engi
neering.
Student Committee
Dr. C. Gilbert Wrenn, chairman
of the Vocational Guidance Com
mittee, acted as chairman of the
meeting. Dr. Wrenn is being assist
ed by a student committee on ma
jors which is formulating plans for
the presentation of the entire series.
Headed by joint chairmen Gib Hol
loway and Stan Cox, the committee
is made up of Don Brown, Carl
Ross, Emily Ross, Frances Grin
wood, and Jcnnett Henderson.
