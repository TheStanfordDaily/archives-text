# "JIBBERING JIMMY" AND HIS PLEDGE
## 
### 
To m,ost politicians, a campaign pledge is just a cam
paign pledge created for the campaign, inspired by the
campaign, and reeking of the campaign. Not so with Our
Jimmy, the genial Governor of California.
A dispatch from the Governor's otlice to the Stanfohd
I)aij.y (lucky paper!) informs us that Rolph will lulfill his
campaign pledge of visiting all the county seals annually.
That should silence forever and ever those cynics that
have accused our Governor of being a mere politician.
The Governor has really made a choice pledge. He
could have gone farther and in Ihe simple Rolphian man
ner, pledged that every year, in tact every day ol every
year, he would bend hearUsoul, and hack in an unceasing
effort to seek re-election.
To allay any fears that this visit to the county seals is
political, Lvnch-Loving Rolph assures us in his most genial
manner that "This tour is in no sense a political one."
What else is there to say?
The reason for the Rolph visit, according to Rolph, is
to study unemployment which problem we are informed
in the dispatch is "closest to the Governor's heart." On the
first half of this circuit, while the Governor is busy jotting
down his observations on sociological conditions through
out the state, he will attend some 21 social functions. This
social function total is distributed somewhat unevenly
among 11 different varieties.
Rox score: Rolph, 11; Heinz, 57.
Jibbering Jimmy v/ill attend: civic luncheons, 7; annual
balls, 1; ordinary luncheons, 1; formal banquets, 1; testi
monial dinners, 2; testimonial banquets, 1; ordinary din
ners, .'I; civic banquets, 2; ordinary banquets, 1; civic din
ners, 1; testimonial dinner dances, 1.
Large indeed are the burdens of the governorship. And
large indeed are the chances that Little Jimmy of Califor
nia will join Little Jimmy of New York as two examples
of raucous individualism in politics.
