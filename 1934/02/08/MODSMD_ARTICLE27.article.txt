# The 						Utter Hopelessness of It All

### 
The prohibition amendment is dead. That experiment
wherein some people tried to tell other people what not to
drink is over. The nation will now go on doing legally
what many people said should be illegal.
The utter hopelessness of it all is revealed by some fig
ures derived from the Repeal Vote. Thus, we learn thAt
2 per cent of New Yorkers were dry; ( .)K per cent voted wet.
in San Francisco, 7 per cent were dry; Chicago, .) per cent
and similarly in all the big cities.
Whftt chance was there for such cities to be dry—even
though alcohol when consumed in sufficient quantities will
pickle a rabbit in 1 minutes and medium-sized female
guinea pigs in six.
Hut though the majority in such cities favored prohi
bition, why should the rest be deprived of what they seem
to want? The policy of attempting to force personal con
victions about personal matters on other people is the rem
nant of the moral crusader that lies dormant within most
of us and lies open and active in W.C.T.I*. workers and
editors.
Drunkenness is a public problem and should be dealt
with; noisv drinkers are a public problem and should be
treated by the law; but what gentleman drinkers call gen
tlemanly drinking should be a personal matter, now when
the majority is wet or ;it some time in the future when it
may change its mind about the question.
