# Preferential Voting, a Maze
## 
### 
Xo white rat running through a maze in the Psychology
building eveV had a more difficult time than a Stanford
electorate with the preferential system of voting.
Kveryone attempts to find some way to avoid giving a
second choice to a bitter rival. As a result, we have many
ballots discarded through some irregularity. This is ridic
ulous. What many do not realize is that if Candidate X is
one of the two highest, his second choices do not count for
anyone. It is only those who are eliminated who have their
second choices counted for other candidates.
In short, all that the preferential system permits is the
light of voters of defeated candidates to choose between
the two highest runners.
Maybe, we too are in the maze with the rats, but we
don't think so.
