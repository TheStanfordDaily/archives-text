# CAMPUS OPINION
## ARE ALL TOUCHED FOR $114? 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Will the gullibility of our pliable
student body again give way to the
advancing onslaughts of B.A.C. com
mercialism? Will the last vestige of
college non-professional football
sportsmanship be ripped off by a
money-mad committee to save a few
sheckles? By abolishing card stunts
our last stand against complete pro
fessionalism goes down for the
count.
It seemed ihe last straw to come
near failing to send our tradition en
trenched Stanford band to the U.S.C.
game in order to save the price of
the space they occupy. It's a case of
cutting off the dog's tail an inch at
a time, we're trying to find how little
we can offer the poor public and still
get their five bucks. It was bad

; enough, at the Big Game, to limit
the sale $1 rooters' tickets to make
more room for the public at $5. Es
pecially when we pay $14 per quar
-1 ter in advance for student body fees
to be on the preferred list at ath
letic meets.
Poor fellow students, please let
there be one dear old college tradi
■ tion at football games. Cardboard is
cheap, surely we can impose on the
quarter of a million dollar gates for
a few varied colored pieces. Be
sides, if we lose our cherished card
tickets, how f-oon before we have to
| bring our own seats or not be ai
! lowed at all? It hurts to make these
few casual observations, but I am
j touched. Is anyone else?
