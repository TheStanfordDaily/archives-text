# DEAR PUZZLED; "WE DO NOT KNOW"
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Making due allowance for the fact
that one of the newly elected mem
bers of Cap and Gown was night
editor for Tuesday's issue of the
Daily, I should like to ask a few
questions. It was stated in the Daily
that Cap and Gown selects its mem
bers on a basis of character, activi
ties, and a B- scholarship. The B
average is supposed to be a deadline,
but two of the new members are be
low that line. Why did Cap and
Cown sacrifice its scholastic standard
for these girls? Was it because of
their unusual activities? (One is a
member of the A.S.S.U. election
board, the other a member of the
Y.W.C.A. cabinet.) Surely not, be
cause these two girls have not been

particularly outstanding in extracur
ricular activities. It must have been
a decision based on "character."
I should like to know, then, just
what lack in character made Cap
and Gown overlook the head spon
sor who was W.A.A. president last
year, the assistant head sponsor, the
A.S.S.U. secretary v/ho is also chair
man of the most important A.W.S.
committee, the other women mem
bers of Ex Committee, the president
of the Union Club, the women's edi
tor of the Daily, the treasurer of
W.A.A., who is also a member of the
junior class Committee of Three, and
others who are really outstanding
women on the campus.
Yours very sincerely,
