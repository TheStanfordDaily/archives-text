# BULL SESSION
## POLITICS BEGINS AT HOME 
### 
The campus is fast becoming poli
tics conscious. With a caucus in
every hall and a candidate in every
! room, Tuesday should see bands
! blaring, candidates cornering the
i elusive ballot, and a grand march of
the enlightened electorate to the
j Law steps.
One of the great nuisances of a
democracy is the nomination of can
didates. But the halls, the Row, even
Encina have already sprung into the
i breach, prepared their slates with
i political chalk of varied hues. Now,
: theoretically, the campus is ready to
break some slater, blot out others,
j send into office the .select few.
But the campus (that poor per
j sonalized abstraction) is sadly un
-1 aware of many of the young hopefuls
who seek to curry public favor.
| Many of these politicos are merely
; publicized names, still more are just
names. Stanford men and women
are not sure whether or not the can
| didates for Men's Council are bow
j legged, bald, or balmy brained. They
do not know precisely if would-be
ex committeemen stutter, lisp, or boo
basketball loaches. The electorate
i deserves to know. And the custo
■ mer is always right.
The most certain means of intro

1 ducing to the Stanford constituency,
Stanford's Jimmy Walkers, John
O'Briens, and George Washingtons
is to hold a "nominating assembly."
That such assemblies have evils, no
cne denies. So do all assemblies. But
the possibility of encountering a
packed hall or a booing and biased
house, are more than offset by the
possibility of eliminating "blind
voting." At present, the name first
I on any ballot is certain to have a
distinct advantage with a huge ma
jorty of voters. Any candidate, thus
favored, who is able to capture the
moronic vote plus the lackadaisical
: vote has an assured future in public
office.
If we are to go in for political ba
loney at all, we may as well bring
our baloney and ham out of the
musty cellars where it inevitably
rots, and into the free blowing winds
of tlie Assembly Hall.
Down the j reased slide into offi
cialdom's gravy bowl, each year
come a horde of virgin and burnt
i cite rings. With a nominating as
: sembiy, there v/iil probably be the
same number of political zeros hailed
into office. But ut least we will have
the pleasure of knowing that we got
what we paid for.

The most certain means of intro

1 ducing to the Stanford constituency,
Stanford's Jimmy Walkers, John
O'Briens, and George Washingtons
is to hold a "nominating assembly."
That such assemblies have evils, no
cne denies. So do all assemblies. But
the possibility of encountering a
packed hall or a booing and biased
house, are more than offset by the
possibility of eliminating "blind
voting." At present, the name first
I on any ballot is certain to have a
distinct advantage with a huge ma
jorty of voters. Any candidate, thus
favored, who is able to capture the
moronic vote plus the lackadaisical
: vote has an assured future in public
office.
If we are to go in for political ba
loney at all, we may as well bring
our baloney and ham out of the
musty cellars where it inevitably
rots, and into the free blowing winds
of tlie Assembly Hall.
Down the j reased slide into offi
cialdom's gravy bowl, each year
come a horde of virgin and burnt

same number of political zeros hailed
into office. But ut least we will have
the pleasure of knowing that we got
what we paid for.

The campus is fast becoming poli
tics conscious. With a caucus in
every hall and a candidate in every
! room, Tuesday should see bands
! blaring, candidates cornering the
i elusive ballot, and a grand march of
the enlightened electorate to the
j Law steps.
One of the great nuisances of a
democracy is the nomination of can
didates. But the halls, the Row, even
Encina have already sprung into the
i breach, prepared their slates with
i political chalk of varied hues. Now,
: theoretically, the campus is ready to
break some slater, blot out others,
j send into office the .select few.
But the campus (that poor per
j sonalized abstraction) is sadly un
-1 aware of many of the young hopefuls
who seek to curry public favor.
| Many of these politicos are merely
; publicized names, still more are just
names. Stanford men and women
are not sure whether or not the can

j legged, bald, or balmy brained. They
do not know precisely if would-be
ex committeemen stutter, lisp, or boo
basketball loaches. The electorate
