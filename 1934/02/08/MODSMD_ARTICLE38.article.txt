"Oh, God, please bring the farm
ers rain before 1:30," Ihe prayer of
all good R.O.T.C. men failed yester
day to tempt the least drop of moist
use from the heavy black clouds that
overhung the barracks as the after
noon class started.
Then after 40 minutes of hard,
bumpy riding came the storm, a sign
that even Jupiter Pluvius can re
spond to military prayers, but the
riding went on and only after an
other brisk period of trotting were
the be-drizzled veterans dismissed.
Perhaps today, rain will cause the
omission of drill, but students are
warned not to cat the class unless a
red flag is flown on the flag pole,
indicating that drill has been called
off.
