THE LAKE. A play in three acts. By Dorothy Massingham in conjunction
with Murray Mac Donald. Doubleday, Doran, N.Y. (At Stanford Bookstore)

This is a drama of suffering—of
very great suffering. It i.s concerned
with "the restless, highly strung,
outwardly indifferent and moody"
Stella Surrege. She is a healthy girl
who, unmarried at 28, seeks to avoid
the sordidness of an intrigue with
one Cecil HarVey, so marries admirer
John Clayne. Clayne is killed di
rectly after the marriage in an au
tomobile accident in The Lake, a
highly symbolic body of water which
Stella's silly mother has built. Stella
suffers intensely through the play's
third act.
"The Lake" begins promisingly
with keenly contrived dialogue
which reveals clearly the world
ridden natures of all of the charac
ters, proceeds through a second act
of gossip by numerous supernumer
ary wedding quests, and falls into an
aimless third act which, utilizing the
methods of the first for revelation
of character, can proceed no further
and so proves only distressingly
repetitive.
The initial idea of the play is one
upon which an excellent drama
could be based. But the introduction
of the watery deus cx machina is as

IN TRAGIC LIFE, PASSIONS SPIN

TIIE PLOT, By Vardis Fisher.
(Doublcday Dor an.)
Not his first books, these two spe
cializations in neurosis will probably
have people talking of Author Var
dis Fisher in the same breath with
other literary hard guys, Dreiser,
Hemingway, Anderson, et al.
Certainly the first two volumes of
his projected tetralogy show Fisher
to bo a writer of prose as simple
and beautiful as any now being is
sued by the school of horrors. There
is poetry and power, a "dark mag
nificence" in these studies of a sen
sitive youth tortured by fear.
Eldest son of a poor Idaho farmer
and his puritanic wife, Vridar Hun
ter grew up in a shack where food
was scarce, comfort unheard of, with
no companions but his younger sis
ter and brother. He was a delicate
child, subject to convulsions and
haunting fears. The sight of blood
made him sick. In Tragic Life is
mostly concerned with Vridar's see
ing blood and getting sick. At the
end of the book something of the
miasma of terror is cleared away by
the healthy laughter of a friend.
Passions Spin the Plot adds com
plications by way of college and a
marriage which is obviously foolish.
The second book looses some of the
grandeur that marked the first; in
stead of presenting the picture of a
boy being shaped and moulded by
an environment beyond his control
(a valid tragic theme) and gaining
his significance as a part of the pio
neer struggle, Vridar becomes en
meshed in petty worries and com
mon frets. He ceases to compel at
tention and sympathy.
Yet this author is capable of real
greatness in his ability to paint a
heroic canvts. He has explored the
depths of human suffering and*
brought to the surface one of the
most significant effects of the West
ward development—the warping of
a human soul by the rude terrors of
the wasteland. What the author's fi
nal interpretation of this theme may
be remains to be seen in the next.

TIIE JOURNEY OF FLAME. By

Antonio <lc Ficrro Blanco. (Ilough
lon Mifflin Co.
Like a strange richly-studded !
Spanish mosaic is this chronicle oi !
the journey of Juan Colorado from
Lower California north to San Fran
cisco in the early nineteenth century, j
It is a ou'.'ious, full-blooded book, J
giving u.s a picture of early Califor
nia, remarkable for its accurate do
tail of observation, but more remark- .
able for its lively narrative writing, j
its acrid and gay humor, and its de- i
iightfully Chaucerian pilgrims.

unintelligible as tho expiration of
Tessa Sanger (apparently because of
some curious and unrelenting mo
rality on the part of Margaret Ken
nedy) in the final scene of "The Con
stant Nymph;'
In neither case is the death of one
of the principals brought about ra
tionally, but the early play is at least
a well contrived theatre piece
whereas "The Lake," its catastrophe
arriving only two-thirds of the way
through the play, is as formless as
the ultra-modern short story.
Beyond this technical matter and
the inexplicably motivated and op
erating morality of Clayne's death,
the initial idea has been forgotten
in the welter of mental and physical
suffering. The result has only been
to make what might have been a
fine drama of character into 'i shape
less, diverted thing in three acts.
Katharine Hepburn is playing the
chief role in "The to capacity
houses in New York. It is possible
that her immense vitality and
strange personal power can blind the
eyes of an audience to the faults of
the play itself. A lesser personality
could not. —Sandoe

| The Journey of the Flame is his
! Tory, autobiography, and fiction, il
: luminating with actuality, both dra
matic and characteristically Latin,
that early California we little know.
It brings to mind the Spanish mis
| sions as they really existed, con-
I temporary opinions of such figures
1 as Junipero Serra, pictures of the
\ barren deserts and ntountains, and
an abundance of thrilling anecdotes
legendary and real. Although the
writing occasionally* becomes too
' manneredly encyclopaedic, the nar
' rative proceeds swiftly, pausing only
I for digressions of pithy aphorism
i which one longs to quote at length.
The philosophy of this book is
malevolent and cruel, as befits its
; varied subject matter: the carnal
j characters, the harsh peasant life,
the murder of animals, the desert
beauties. One may only wonder at
the identity of the gifted narrator,
Ficrro Blanco, said to be an old
Spanish-American. But at the same
time one can be grateful to the ex
cellent translation of Walter de
Steiguer, who has given us this rich
design with sympathetic vivacity and
glamorous authenticity.
