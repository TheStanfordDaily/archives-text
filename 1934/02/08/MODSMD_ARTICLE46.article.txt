## 
### 
Recognition of the value of the
pamphlet, "Practical Study Aids,"
written by Dr. C. Gilbert Wrann, as
sistant registrar, was given in a stu
dent opinion published in the Po
mona College "Student Life" which
recommended its use to obtain effi
cient study results.
According to the article, students
at Pomona are turning to Dr.
Wrenn's suggestions for a solution
of their scholastic problems arising
from study habits. By following a
time schedule such as is suggested,
the writer states that although suf
ficient time is allowed for sports,
recreation, extra-curricular activi
ties, and rest, one may triple the
amount of work accomplished al
though the actual time spent is not
greatly increased.
Increased use of the booklet by
both faculty and students of Ameri
can colleges and universities has
been noted End over 22,000 copies
have been sold, according to the
Stanford University Press, which
published the book. The 16-page
pamphlet includes suggestions for
budgeting one's time, increasing
reading efficiency, improving one's
ability to concentrate, taking notes,
and preparing for examinations.

Dr. Wrenn has also prepared a test
to discover where the students'
; weaknesses in study habits lie. This
was published last year and is used
1 extensively. Also published by him
is the booklet, "Study Hints for
High School Students," which is used
by secondary schools. The booklet, |
; "Practical Study Habits," is on sale >
! at the Bookstore at 15 cents a copy. 1
