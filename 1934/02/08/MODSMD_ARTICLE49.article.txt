# CARD RUGBY TEAM SCHEDULES TOUGH BATTLES SATURDAY
## 
### 
Prepared to slap down the ears of
an obstreperous Olympic Club rug
by squad which stands in the way
of Stanford's second successive
Northern Rugby Union champion
ship, Farm ruggers travel to San
Francisco Saturday.
The big game, ballyhooed in the
city as the rugby classic of the un
ion season, will be played in Seals'
Stadium, preceded by a preliminary
which starts at 2 o'clock.
Dink to Broadcast
Dink Templeton, whose trenchant
criticism of the game as voiced over
the Stanford Stadium loudspeakers
last year literally brought down the
house, will be behind the micro
phone again at Seals' Stadium, in
himself representing a drawing card
almost equal to the ruggers.

During the absence of Coach Jim
Wylie, Director of Minor Sports
Harry Malcney has taken over the
rugger reins and is driving his men
at a hot and fast pace this week.
The Olympians are by no means a
conglomeration of hollow shells, but
on the contrary are a rugged young
outfit with a good leavening of ex
perience.
Olympian Stare
They have been regularly prac
ticing three times a week, which
goes the Indians just one day better.
Their two most spectacular players
include "Brick" Marcus, former
California halfback, and Scotchy
Campbell, onetime Stanford and
Olympic player.
Campbell is a front ranker and
adept at hooking the ball out of the
scrum, an operation at which Stan
ford has been woefully deficient this
season, although they gave signs of
improvement last week in defeating
Claremont 2S-3.
O.C. Leads League
The Olympians are at present
leading the union league with seven
straight victories, while Stanford
has won four and had a tie with
San Jose as their only hitch. A
victory over the Olympics would
clear the way for the Indians, who
should have not much difficulty
knocking over California and Lane
Hospital, two of the lower bracket
teams.
Bill Sim, intermittently a rugby
player and a boxer, has been stick
ing to the latter sport lately, and,
suffering an injured instep, may not
be available Saturday, although he
may get in as a substitute.
Vigna Shows Speed
Johnny Reisner, who just about
leads the league for scoring tries,
and Ray Lewis, who is also right
up there at the top because of his
expert conversion kicking, are both
in great shape. Joe Vigna, who has
been jjlugging along without much
show in the Indian backfield, also
got a break last week and demon
strated that given the opportunity,
he has a plentitude of speed.
Frank Alustiza, the demon long
distance kicker of Tiny Thornhill's
squad, will be on deck and may
play.

clear the way for the Indians, who
should have not much difficulty
knocking over California and Lane
Hospital, two of the lower bracket
teams.
Bill Sim, intermittently a rugby
player and a boxer, has been stick
ing to the latter sport lately, and,
suffering an injured instep, may not
be available Saturday, although he
may get in as a substitute.
Vigna Shows Speed
Johnny Reisner, who just about
leads the league for scoring tries,
and Ray Lewis, who is also right
up there at the top because of his
expert conversion kicking, are both
in great shape. Joe Vigna, who has
been jjlugging along without much
show in the Indian backfield, also
got a break last week and demon
strated that given the opportunity,
he has a plentitude of speed.
Frank Alustiza, the demon long
distance kicker of Tiny Thornhill's
squad, will be on deck and may
play.
Prepared to slap down the ears of
an obstreperous Olympic Club rug
by squad which stands in the way
of Stanford's second successive
Northern Rugby Union champion
ship, Farm ruggers travel to San
Francisco Saturday.
The big game, ballyhooed in the
city as the rugby classic of the un
ion season, will be played in Seals'
Stadium, preceded by a preliminary
which starts at 2 o'clock.
Dink to Broadcast
Dink Templeton, whose trenchant
criticism of the game as voiced over
the Stanford Stadium loudspeakers
last year literally brought down the
house, will be behind the micro
phone again at Seals' Stadium, in
himself representing a drawing card
almost equal to the ruggers.

During the absence of Coach Jim
Wylie, Director of Minor Sports
Harry Malcney has taken over the
rugger reins and is driving his men
at a hot and fast pace this week.
The Olympians are by no means a
conglomeration of hollow shells, but
on the contrary are a rugged young
outfit with a good leavening of ex
perience.
Olympian Stare
They have been regularly prac
ticing three times a week, which
goes the Indians just one day better.
Their two most spectacular players
include "Brick" Marcus, former
California halfback, and Scotchy
Campbell, onetime Stanford and
Olympic player.
Campbell is a front ranker and
adept at hooking the ball out of the
scrum, an operation at which Stan
ford has been woefully deficient this
season, although they gave signs of
improvement last week in defeating
Claremont 2S-3.
O.C. Leads League
The Olympians are at present
leading the union league with seven
straight victories, while Stanford
has won four and had a tie with
San Jose as their only hitch. A
victory over the Olympics would
clear the way for the Indians, who
should have not much difficulty
knocking over California and Lane
Hospital, two of the lower bracket
teams.
