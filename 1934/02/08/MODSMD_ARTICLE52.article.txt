# Polo Squad to Play Oregon State Team In Conference Game
## Stanford Mallet â€“ Swingers Journey to Cornwallis For Encounter 
### 
Taking their first fling at indoor
polo, Stanford's journeying mallet -
vvielders will meet Oregon State's
team today and Saturday at Cor
vallis in their first conference polo
series of the 1934 season.
Stanford, California, and Oregon
State and Southern California's
newly organized squad, which # has
not yet met the Indians, are the only
j coast conference polo-playing uni
j versities.
I Though having had no indoor ex
| perience as a team, Stanford will
| carry the advantage of having two
| team members who have seen con
siderable action in a sheltered
arena. Both Bob Fullerton and Rus
sell Rasmussen, new arrivals from
Culver Military Academy, played
indoors almost exclusively in prep
school.
Frosh to Play
j Though both freshmen, Rasmus
j sen and Fullerton are now eligible
j for varsity play as a result of the
: January meeting of Pacific Coast
| conference officials. At that time it
j was decided, by mutual agreement,
that conference polo teams could
use men for four years of varsity
play.
Previously it had been necessary
to abide by the regular three-year
competition rule. Since no univer
sity is able to support a freshman
team, as in other sports, it was de
cided to waive the regular rule, so
that collegiate poloists would not
have to stay out of competition for
a full year.
Captain Luppe Luppen, two-j'ear
veteran, Bill Rogers, experienced
poloist, and Rasmussen and Fuller
ton, the two newcomers, are the
four men to make the trip north.
All will probably see action before
the two-game series is over. Woody
Melone, who held down a first
string position last fall, graduated at
the end of autumn quarter.
Oregon Is Good
Though having played no teams
that have met Captain Gordan's rid
ers, Oregon State is expected to j
have a sti'ong trio to pit against the i
invading Indians. Three lettermen, !
who have had a year's experience i
in playing together, will probably
start for the Beavers. With several
years of competition behind them,
these men are Red Withers, Joe
Hedgpeth, and Hugh O'Neill.
One of the best teams that Cap- j
tain Gordan has coached in several !
years, the Stanford squad places |
its hopes for victory upon the ease j
with which it can adapt itself to ;
indoor play.

Stanford, California, and Oregon
State and Southern California's
newly organized squad, which # has
not yet met the Indians, are the only
j coast conference polo-playing uni
j versities.
I Though having had no indoor ex
| perience as a team, Stanford will
| carry the advantage of having two
| team members who have seen con
siderable action in a sheltered
arena. Both Bob Fullerton and Rus
sell Rasmussen, new arrivals from
Culver Military Academy, played
indoors almost exclusively in prep
school.
Frosh to Play
j Though both freshmen, Rasmus
j sen and Fullerton are now eligible
j for varsity play as a result of the
: January meeting of Pacific Coast
| conference officials. At that time it
j was decided, by mutual agreement,
that conference polo teams could
use men for four years of varsity
play.
Previously it had been necessary
to abide by the regular three-year
competition rule. Since no univer
sity is able to support a freshman
team, as in other sports, it was de
cided to waive the regular rule, so
that collegiate poloists would not
have to stay out of competition for
a full year.
Captain Luppe Luppen, two-j'ear
veteran, Bill Rogers, experienced
poloist, and Rasmussen and Fuller
ton, the two newcomers, are the
four men to make the trip north.
All will probably see action before
the two-game series is over. Woody
Melone, who held down a first
string position last fall, graduated at
the end of autumn quarter.
Oregon Is Good
Though having played no teams
that have met Captain Gordan's rid
ers, Oregon State is expected to j
have a sti'ong trio to pit against the i
invading Indians. Three lettermen, !
who have had a year's experience i
in playing together, will probably
start for the Beavers. With several
years of competition behind them,
these men are Red Withers, Joe
Hedgpeth, and Hugh O'Neill.
One of the best teams that Cap- j
tain Gordan has coached in several !
years, the Stanford squad places |
its hopes for victory upon the ease j
with which it can adapt itself to ;
indoor play.
Taking their first fling at indoor
polo, Stanford's journeying mallet -
vvielders will meet Oregon State's
team today and Saturday at Cor
vallis in their first conference polo
series of the 1934 season.
