Fate played a queer trick on Rep
resentative Marian Clark, ihe new
woman member of the house from
New York.
Years ago, when she was attending
Colorado College, she was told by
a professor that speech-making
would never be one of her accomp
lishments.
Well, the co-ed not only married
the professor, hut in later years she
made campaign speeches for him,
and finally she had to make her own
campaign speeches after he died, as
she decided to take his place in the
house.
Stanford co-eds, don't let those
public-speaking profs discourage
you!
