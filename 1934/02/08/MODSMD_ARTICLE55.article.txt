# RAIN PREVENTS KINEALY GAME
## Card Varsity Nine Takes Practice Lay-Off 
### 
Stanford's powerful varsity base
ball club was forced to seek shelter
from the elements yesterday for the
first time this season when the
threatening skies and drizzles caused
cancellation of the scheduled battle
! against the Kenealy SeaLs which was
to be played here.
Wasting no time, however, Coach
Harry Wolter conducted a chalk talk
;in the varsity dressing room in
which he explained some of the in
tricacies of th ? game to his charges.
Lay-off Not Serious
The weather man has been unu
| sually kind 10 the Card batsmen so
1 far this year so the lay-off is not as
: serious as it might have been. The
team, even at this early date, is in
1 mid-season form.
Nevertheless, it is ardently hoped
by all concerned that the present in
clemency will pass in time to allow
Saturday's game against A1 Erie's
aggregation of All-Stars. Only three
practice games remain on the Card
schedule before the conference race
gets under way March 10.
Bears Look Good
In the mean time, reports rift in
from the Berkeley campus that last
year's conference champions have a
team which experts in touch with
the situation believe will have little
trouble repeating its championship
grabbing s'unt. In the first game of
the season last Saturday the 'Bears
beat Ted Webb's strong California
Alumni team which had such men
as Tay and Roily Doutthit and Hei
nie Glaister in the lineup.
Pre - conference indications are
that the forthcoming race will be
dominated by California and Stan
ford, with Southern California right
in the running.
Material Plentiful
Coach Clint Evans has a wealth of j
material from which to choose a rep- !
resentative team. The Cal squad \
boasts no less than 11 twirlers, five '
of whom are left-handers. The hurl- j
ing staff is headed by Bill Peterson i
who returns to the squad after a |
year's lay-off. Peterson was a big :
gun on the Bear varsity in 1932 but
was incapacitated last season when
he cracked his wrist early in the ;
season.
Southern California has lost .a '
number of veterans but reports point
out that there are plenty of capable i
youngsters fighting for the vacant !
positions.
St. Mary's, the other team in the j
Conference, is the league's unknown ;
quantity. Â»
