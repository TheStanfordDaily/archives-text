# Snowballs and Moss
## 
### 
The snowball is rolling, but maybe
it can't be stopped. C.W.A. was sup
posed to end by May 1. The House
passed 950 millions worth of exten
sion. Senate, now wrangling over it,
has it at top of unfinished business
for today. Report is that some graft
loving moss - backed white - boards
want to give it 10 biilionsâ€”where
from, we dor't know.
Incidentally, F.R. is going to have
to do plenty of heavy slamming with
the big stick if he expects to keep
his Senate majority in line. Maybe
the deal is getting cold.
