# CARD HOOP SQUAD LOSES GUARD FOR U.C.L.A. TANGLES
## 
### 
With Gordy Mallatratt, hard
scrapping guard, consigned to the
hospital with a bad cold, Stanford
basketball fortunes took a slight dip
downward yesterday, although op
timism still reigned concerning to
morrow and Saturday's series with
U.C.L.A., the acknowledged weak
sister of the conference.
Rudely jolted out of any cham
pionship aspirations by Califor
nia's sweeping 42 to 23 victory last
Saturday, Coach John Bunn and
his Indians will he all ready to
get back in the winning column
tomorrow night. U.C.L.A., un
mercifully buffeted about by sun
dry Bears and Trojans, will also
be gunning for a much-desired
victory
Chief threat of the visiting Bruin
contingent, as in years past, will
probably be Captain Don Piper,
sharp-shooting forward. Piper was
high scorer in the conference last
season, but has been shoved down
to sixth rank so far this year. If
Stanford can bottle him up as suc
cessfully as in the last Bruin series,
when he scored but twelve points,
he won't be particularly dangerous.
U.C.L.A.'s Defect
The chief defect of U.C.L.A.'s
quintet so far this year has been
inexperience, three and sometimes
four members of the starting lineup
being only sophomores.
Having come through their ordeal
of fire against California and U.S.C.
since playing Stanford, the young
Bruins may have acquired enough
savoir-faire by now to give the In
dians trouble.
Indian Line-Up
Though most of his high scorers
were pretty effectively bottled up
in last week's California game,
Coach John Bunn will probably use
the same lineup, with the possible
exception of Mallatratt, that has
started the past few games.
If Mallatratt is unable to play, A1
Page or Robin Lindsey may fill in
at the other guard opposite Rogers.
Both have shown considerable speed
and ability in scrimmage and prac
tice games.

The wedding ring wis derived
from a circular Egyptian hiero
glyphic, meaning "eternity."
