# Satirical Paper Dollies Feature of Daily Trojan
## 
### 
Daily Trojan has again crashed
through with a novel stunt. This
time it's a series of cuts on the edit
pnge of "Paper dollies." They are
not of the designed-for-kiddies type,
however. Eyeh day a prominent
campus femine is satirized, telling all
her foibles in the caption beiow th"
clothing designs. Some are humor
ous, as number two in the series:
"Christly Hostess Fox .... in sheep's
clothing."

Walls of U.S.C.'s Graduate School
are decorated with Chinese classical
scrolls mounted on fine blue and
blue- and cream colored silk, the gift
of a former student.
