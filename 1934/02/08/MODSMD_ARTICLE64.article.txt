The Indian defense has been con
sistently hard to penetrate all year.
Thornton will line the freshmen
up as follows: Captain Bob Hoover.
Ben Voss, and Alex MacKcnzie, for- 1
wards; Bob Harris, Don Peterson,
and Pat Pearson, guards; Bob Has
lacher or Jack Sharlin, goalie.
Admission to both contests will be ;

An organized and championship
headed Stanford varsity water polo
seven will meet an all-star title
contending Olympic Club squad in
the Encina pools here Saturday af
ternoon in the important game of
the Northern California Water Polo
League's 1933-34 schedule.
A preliminary game between (he
Stanford Frosh and O. C. Juniors
will open the aquatic activities at
3:30 o'clock; the varsity contest is
scheduled to start at 4:15 o'clock.
12 Straight Wins
Coach Nort Thornton's Cardinal
team will attempt to add to its
dozen straight victories and also to
cinch its second successive league
championship. Stanford has not lost
a game since formation of the
Northern California circuit last year.
As an all-star assembly, the
Olympic Club claims one of the
most powerful water polo organiza
tions ever to have played together.
With three former American Olym
pic Games team members—Elmer
Collett, Ginger Austin, and George
Mitchell—as a nucleus, the Club has
added a pair of former Stanford
stars, Ted Wiget and Whitey Burns,
besides several other well - known
mermen.
O.C. Powerful
With Wiget. one of the speediest
splashers on th< coast, swimming in
the sprint position, and Austin and
Jack Toupe playing at the other
forward posts, the San Franciscans
have as powerful an offensive as
they could want.
Burns will start the game at the
center back position, and Winged-0
guards will be Mitchell and Mar
shall Dunn. Collett will work in the
goal department.
Thornton will use a Stanford
team consisting of Vlad Taranik,
sprint; Jimmy Benet and Bob Fos
ter, forwards; Bill Woodard, center
back; Wally Wiget and Captain
Gordy Graves, guards; Leo Cook,
goalie.
Even Tilt Stten
A man - for - man comparison
points to an even game; any small '
Indian advantage accorded is be- |
cause of the superior Cardinal or
ganization and condition.
The undefeated Indian freshmen
also will endeavor to cinch the title
of the junior league. The Olympic
Club juniors are second to Stanford
in the standings, and this contest
also '.s figured a toss-up. A battle
rivaling the varsity encounter in
excitement is promised when the i
less-experienced youths engage.
Frosh Team Strong

ted 14 goals engineered at the ex- 1
perise of Lakeside last Saturday,
