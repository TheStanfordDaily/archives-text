# DINK STILL HUNTS FOR RELAY RUNNERS
## 
### 
Dink Templeton's exhaustive, and
i as yet semi-fruitless, search for four
I men who can tear oft' a 440 in re
i spectable time without turning pink,
i green, and yellow in the doing, still
! goes on, and will probably be going
|on most all season. He needs a re
j lay team, and as the relay means
five points, those five points will
! probably be pretty useful against
Cal and U.S.C.
Of course there is A1 Blackman,
j but he will be another man, and after
I running the straight 440, and possi
j bly a 220, earlier in the day, prob-
I ably won't be able to run the first
' lap too, as might be expedient.
Then there is "Truck" Dellinger,
| who last year won the Little Big
j Meet quarter, and has been doing
j around 51 seconds to date. He works
pretty hard when he runs, however,
and two races may be a little too
much for one day.
The rest of the team must be taken
from other events. From the 880,
possibilities are Chuck Nimmo, Joe
Burris, Bill Soxenson, and Lloyd Da
vis, but all seem to lack one element
: —speed. Carlton Thorns may be
drafted from the dashes, and would
I probably be a good man, except that
he will have to go through four races
| previous, both heats and fin?ls.
Teinpleton once mentioned the
1 possible team of Thorns, Nimmo,
Meier, and Blackman. Thorns has
I not run a quarter on Angell Field
as yet, Nirnmo's best mark is 52.8,
and Meier is concentrating at pres
ent on his hurdles, so the outlook
is pretty weary. Johnny Mottram
ran the quarter as a frosh, and he
i may appear somewhere in the pic
ture yet. Then there is one Smith,
who ran last fall, but is not out at
I present.
So, to keep from defaulting ihose
I five points, Templeton must use four
i of the above men, and hope for the
i best.

I not run a quarter on Angell Field
as yet, Nirnmo's best mark is 52.8,
and Meier is concentrating at pres
ent on his hurdles, so the outlook
is pretty weary. Johnny Mottram
ran the quarter as a frosh, and he
i may appear somewhere in the pic
ture yet. Then there is one Smith,
who ran last fall, but is not out at
I present.
So, to keep from defaulting ihose
I five points, Templeton must use four
i of the above men, and hope for the
i best.
