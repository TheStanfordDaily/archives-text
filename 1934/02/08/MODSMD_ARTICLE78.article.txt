# Librarians Baffled By Unwritten Book Requests
## 
### 
Several unwritten books have
have been asked for at the Library,
but several particular boners were
committed lately. One students
asked for "Romeo and Juliet" by Ju
lius Caesar, and was dismayed and
dissatisfied when presented with
Shakespeare's version.
Another prizs incident occurred a
few days ago A'hen a professor wrote
a reading list almost illegibly on the
the blackboard. Those seated in
front copied, correctly, Beard's "The
Mind that Found Itself." The back
seaters, on coming to the back room,
insisted on getting "The Animal
That Found Itself."

Alvin Jackson is a new colored
sprint sensation at Michigan to suc
