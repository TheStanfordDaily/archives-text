BREAKFAST
for 8 o'clock martyrs
Here's an alarm-clock for appetites that like
to sleep late in the morning. Crisp, delicious
Kellogg's Corn Flakes, rich in energy.
Try them tomorrow morning with milk
or cream. Add fruits or honey, and you'll
actually enjoy getting up for breakfast.
Kellogg's are a real treat at night, too —
after a date, or a cramming session. They
make an ideal "night-cap." So light and easy
to digest. Kellogg's Corn Flakes encourage
sound, restful sleep.
Always oven-fresh and crisp.
Made by Kellogg in Battle Creek.
