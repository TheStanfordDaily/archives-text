You should have seen Mr. Mooningway's ear-to-ear
grin as he walked out of our office with his pet duck,
Ossie, tucked safely under his arm.
But let us tell you how we happened to find Ossie. It
was one dismal afternoon about four o'clock that Mr.
Mooningway came into our office with tears in his eyes
and a throb in his voice. "I-I-I've I - 10-lost O-Os-Ossie,
he sobbed. Naturally we were touched but we reassured
him that his troubles were practically over—and then
we told him about Daily Want Ads.
Just fifteen words was all it took; just thirty-five cents
was all it cost Mr. Mooningway (though he said to spare
no expense). The result was just as we expected! The
very next day Ossie was quacking contentedly from her
master's arms.
