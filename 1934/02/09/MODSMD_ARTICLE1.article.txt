## Not So Bloody 
### 
Riots cooled off, yet remained
smoldering in France yesterday as
the people awaited the results of
Dictator Doumergue's efforts to cre
ate a super-cabinet of "strong men"
—hoping to unite republicans of all
factions and ward off revolution,
either royalist or communist.
One more rioter died —official total
now at 18, with 14 still critically
wounded, and better than two thou
sand on the injured list.
Twenty-four-hour strike called
for next Monday grows. Paris
Trades Syndicate, National Teachers
Union, Federal Civil Servants, sub
way, street-car, and bus drivel's —
all voted to join.

What rioting remains is disor
ganized, intermittent. No fascist
movement is evident at all. Royal
lists and Communists still fight a bit.
The Marseillaise mingles with the
Internationale—the smoke is clear
ing away. But troops are setting up
machine guns in the streets—just in
case.
