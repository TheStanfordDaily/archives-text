# Caucus Climax Reached As Humorists Hold Meet
## Independent Gathering Amidst Gloom of Rifle Range Nominates Coonradt, von Breton with Acclaim 
### COONRADT VON BRETON 
Campus caucus climax came today
when the embattled humorists em
bittered by successive Hall, Row,
and freshman cauci ignoring the
forces of fun, met and drafted a
ticket at their meeting in the rifle
range below Quad.
Coonradt rnd von Breton ad
dressed the meeting. Amid the noi
some odors of the musty range an
aroused gathering of von Radton and
Coonbret received the oratory of the
leaders with ringing ahahahas, rau
cous shouts, and occasional bullets.
The climax came as von Breton
and Coonradt were nominated by
exclamation for vice-president and
secretary of the Class of 1934, re
spectively. Bombs burst and candi
dates cheered. Said von Coonman in
a stirring speech: "You are faced
with the most seriously side-split
ting situation in the history of the
Wilbur administration. We are met
to meet, not to fulminate and unlike
the freshman we can nominate two

candidates, .not one."
"Gentlemen," said Coonbreton,
greeted with enthusiasm by his lis
teners, "we i're sure of success. Be
hind us mass the philosophical, the
Communist votes: the irate Grads
are with us to a man (or woman).
This is an independent movement for
an independent majority by inde
pendents, for independents, and after
independence. July fourth, 1776, had
nothing on (his."
Coonvon and Bretrad fired several
volleys into the air, both bulls-eyes,
shook hands, and muttering daxkly,
stumbled exhausted from the meet
ing, pronounced by both to be a
most successful caucus. Even better
said von Bercoon than the frosh
caucus.
A rumor meanwhile went the
rounds that no-athlcte von Breton
would, scorning nominations, run as
a write-in candidates for B.A.C. by
rounds: former membership on Cal
ifornia Country Club grounds com
mittee.
