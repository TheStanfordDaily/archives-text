# SUICIDE MOTIVE STILL IN DOUBT
## Attempts Fail to Learn Death Reason 
### 
Still at a loss for any feasible rea- |
sons why Frederick C. Winkler ,
should have taken his life Wednes- |
day night, police, relatives, and Chi j
Psi brothers could not explain the '
sudden death of the 19-year-old I
sophomore, last night.
Henry O. Winkler, paint - gun
manufacturer of 1131 Tower road, I
Beverly Hills, arrived yesterday af- |
ternoon. He was notified of the |
tragedy shortly after the body of
his so nwas found at. 10:30 Wednes- ;
day night, but could not account for
the boy's actions.
No Affairs
Members of Winkler's fraternity
were also nonplussed as they agreed i
that Winkler seemed to be happy
and was friendly with every one.
Rumor that he was despondent over I
an affair with a girl was discredited '
by letters, found in a box in the I
car, from Miss Betty Greary, Uni- 1
versity of California student at Los ;
Angeles, which were of a most j
friendly nature, and he was not par- \
ticularlj' well-acquaihtcd with any |
women on the campus, according to j
his brothers.
Only indication that Winkler was i
despondent was an unexplained note
written on the back of an automo
bile registration certificate, found in
a locked strong box with some let- i
ters in the car. It was addressed to |
no one, unsigned. It was as fol- j
lows:
"Unsigned Note
"Happiness is a wonderful thing— !
the most precious thing anyone can
have—and it should be the goal of |
everyone, no matter who they are, !
what they are, or how they got that j
way—guard your happiness as your j
most treasured possession. I lost it
and was defeated in the battle to
regain it."
There was also a letter written to i
William W. Winkler, Madison, Wis- J
consin, which was short because, as i
it was explained in the letter, he i
was about to work on a psychology j
paper, "How to Break Habits, by j
One Who Has Never Tried." Indi
cations were that he was intending
to work on this paper when he !
drove out the Sandhill road, where
he met his death, as two books,
"Human Nature and Conduct," and !
"Habit Formation and the Science I
of Teaching," were found in his car. !

day night, police, relatives, and Chi j
Psi brothers could not explain the '
sudden death of the 19-year-old I
sophomore, last night.
Henry O. Winkler, paint - gun
manufacturer of 1131 Tower road, I
Beverly Hills, arrived yesterday af- |
ternoon. He was notified of the |
tragedy shortly after the body of
his so nwas found at. 10:30 Wednes- ;
day night, but could not account for
the boy's actions.
No Affairs
Members of Winkler's fraternity
were also nonplussed as they agreed i
that Winkler seemed to be happy
and was friendly with every one.
Rumor that he was despondent over I
an affair with a girl was discredited '
by letters, found in a box in the I
car, from Miss Betty Greary, Uni- 1
versity of California student at Los ;
Angeles, which were of a most j
friendly nature, and he was not par- \
ticularlj' well-acquaihtcd with any |
women on the campus, according to j
his brothers.
Only indication that Winkler was i
despondent was an unexplained note
written on the back of an automo
bile registration certificate, found in
a locked strong box with some let- i
ters in the car. It was addressed to |
no one, unsigned. It was as fol- j
lows:
"Unsigned Note
"Happiness is a wonderful thing— !
the most precious thing anyone can
have—and it should be the goal of |
everyone, no matter who they are, !
what they are, or how they got that j
way—guard your happiness as your j
most treasured possession. I lost it
and was defeated in the battle to
regain it."
There was also a letter written to i
William W. Winkler, Madison, Wis- J
consin, which was short because, as i
it was explained in the letter, he i
was about to work on a psychology j
paper, "How to Break Habits, by j
One Who Has Never Tried." Indi
cations were that he was intending
to work on this paper when he !
drove out the Sandhill road, where
he met his death, as two books,
"Human Nature and Conduct," and !
"Habit Formation and the Science I
of Teaching," were found in his car. !
Still at a loss for any feasible rea- |
sons why Frederick C. Winkler ,
should have taken his life Wednes- |
day night, police, relatives, and Chi j
Psi brothers could not explain the '
