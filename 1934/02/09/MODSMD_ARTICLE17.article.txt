# CAKE EATERS IN RIOTOUS SHOW, EARN PLAUDITS
## Benet's Direction Praised; Sandoe Interpretation Hilarious 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
"Down, down, down with every
thing that's up!" That was the war
cry of the countless revolutionists j
who cluttered the stage of the Lit- i
tie Theatre last night, when Sword j
and Sandals presented "Let 'Em Eat |
Cake"—sequel to "Of Thee I Sing." !
Granting that the present opus is i
not as funny as its pi'edecessor, it I
is still a very, very funny play, j
That fact was made patent last night j
by the very skilled readers.
Direction Good
James Benet's direction was
largely responsible for the success j
of the reading, in that he caught so I
well the rollicking spirit that the '
lines demanded. Laugh honors |
went easily to James Sandoe as'
Alexander Throttlebotton. Sandoe'
used voice, gesture, and facial cx- I
pression to make a hilarious inter- i
pretation of a hilarious character. |
The more "straight" roles of the j
evening were read by John Peck- |
ham as Wintergreen and Jean Al
bertson as his spouse. Peckham !
was more than distinctly capable. ■
He made an amusing as well as!
pleasing Wintergreen. Miss Albert- j
son had a minimum of comic lines, |
but those she managed well, and j
was charming in her part.
High Comedy Achieved
Probably the surprises of the i
whole affair were James McElney ;
and Dick Dawson. The former as |
the calculating Lippmann was ex- !
ceptionally funny. Dav/son it was j
who upheld the "Down, down" mo- i
tif, and he did it with astonishing |
spirit and very comic effect.
Bob Brauns' General Snookfield
was delightful, particularly his "Hi
di-hi" speech in the second act. His
colaborator, Trixie, was Jeanette
Roscnfeld, and a finer colaborator a j
genei'al never had.
Among the others, Henry Brill, |
James Copp, and Bill Gwinn—who |
played all manner of roles well— :
were valuable assets, while the oth
er readers were —to a man and i
woman—adequate.
