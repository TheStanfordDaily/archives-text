A hard-hitting Stanford polo team
defeated Oregon State College in
Corvallis last night, 16 to 5V>. Stan
ford led 'J to 41/2 at half time, and
piled up seven points against a
single counter for Oregon State in
the last three chukkers.
Although Rus Rusmussen led the
Stanfox-d scoring with six goals, the
outstanding defensive work of Will
Rogers, Jr., halted several Oregon
rallies. Rasmussen showed an ir
repressible offensive drive.
Grant Perry, Orange Number 1
player, made all of the Oregon State
points, while Captain Joe Hedgpeth
starred in the back position for the
losing quartet.
The Indians will meet Oregon
again Saturday afternoon.

Universal compulsory military
training in times of peace is asked by
a Des Moines army man as a means
of maintaining peace.
