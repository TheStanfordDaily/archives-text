# Women Athletes Out-Rate Men's Honorary Society
## 
### 
Women's athletic teams have a
higher average scholastic record
than do the honorary fraternities
and professional societies, a survey
of grade point ratios for registered
groups last year prepared by the
registrar's office shows.
Based on the average grade point
standing of 2.56 for the entire uni
versity, the women showed a much
higher average than the men, being
2.76 as against 2.56. Non fraternity
men were brighter than the Greeks
and students living off campus made
better grades than groups living in
any dormitory or house on the cam
pus.
