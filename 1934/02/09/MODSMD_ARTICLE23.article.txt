### FRANCES AYRES 
James Joyce's "Ulysses," literary
immigrant lately declared legal and
fit for American publishing houses,
iy not a foreigner lo Stanlord. Long
before the uanned and much dis
cussed masterpiece was made an
honest book by Federal Judge John
Munro Woolsey's decision, it was
available to jptanford students for
the asking— at their own Library.
A French copy of the book, bought
from a private collection in Carmel,
w;.s in the Rare Book Room and the
only reason for this isolatu n, says
Library Director Nathan Van Pat
ten, iff that : ome degree of supcrvi
ior was necessary to prevent the
book from being stolen.
"Ulysses" has also be*, n on the
shelves of th • Union lending library

where its reputation explained
popularity. According to Gaylord
Hart, in charge of the library, stu
dents want to read it because it was
banned, received much publicity,
and is supposed to be "dirty. The
majority of them, however, do not
appreciate it nor understand it, and
"Ulysses" is returned in a day or
two, obviously unread, as tiue ap
preciation can only come after three
or four readings, it is said.
That "Ulysses" is not a book for
children and college students is the,
opinion of English Instructor Ivor
Winters. This restriction is not
bftsed on the supposed "obscenity"
of the epic but because it cannot be
understood unless the reader has a
thorough knowledge of (lie history
of the American novel.
