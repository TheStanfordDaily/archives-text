# Charlie Karl Warns Voters Not to 'Work' Preferential System
## New Ballot Rule Explained; 4 Candidates Decline Nominations 
### Irvin Jorgensen 
Student voters who do not mark
in second and third choices in the
preferential ballot system according
to their own desires for a second or
third choice candidate are defeating
their own purposes, warns Election
Board Chairman Charlie Karl. Stu
dents. who try to "work" the prefer
ential ballot system in excess zeal
for their first choice do not realize
it will do no good, he states.
Karl says that there are two ways
in which voters try to work the
preferential ballot system in favor
of their candidate. One is by not
filling out second or third choices;
the other is by filling in a third
grade ma nfor second choice, be
cause the individual thinks it will
help his favorite. The first way
leads to throwing out the ballot; the
second may lead to the selection of
the third grade man, and cannot
possibly help his man, no matter
how he figures it.

The way preferential ballots are
counted is this, according to Karl:
If one candidate does not receive a
simple majority of first choices, the
two highest candidates' votes are
recorded ad the second and third
choices on their ballots are disre
garded. The second choices of the
candidates receiving the lowest
number of first-choice votes are
then counted and added to the to
tals of the two leaders. If no major
ity is then received his third choices
are counted.
Example of System
Assume the voter wants to help
his friend John Strong, who is run
ning against John Medium and John
Weak, and places Weak's name as
second choice, just because he's
afraid a second choice for Medium
would defeat his candidate, he's la
boring under a very idle delusion.
Because, if Strong and Medium
fight it out without a majority in
the first choices, their second and
third choices are disregarded. But
if Weak and Medium are fighting
it out for a majority, his second
choice for Weak, may get Weak in
office.
No Use to Cheat
In other words, a coter, no matter
how he works it, can do no more
for his caididate than placc him first.
After he has done that, he merely
gets a chance to say which he would
prefer, Weak or Medium.
The system works just as if it
were a primary, where one or two
candidates may be eliminated. The
two leaders then hold a run-off
election, bidding for the votes of the
eliminated candidates.
