# THE 						CITY PAPERS AND STANFORD
## 
### 
A voting fellow lias committed suicide. It is completely
iiMcxplainable to everyone except the rewrite men on
the city papers. To them, it is a clear sign of divine provi
dence. A news story has broken out of Stanford; aiid
papers are selling on the streets. Thai is all-important.
The story must be made interesting and the truth does
not interest very many people. The story is xpanded. Dull
threads are woven into lurid patterns.
The tragic suicide, understandable only to someone
who can tell what went on in Frederick Winkler's mind
in the few hours preceding the placing of the muzzle to
his temple, becomes a city-wide dinner topic.
The man on the streets must know why. lie is told
why; and as his concept of disaster revolves around one
of several limited lields, the explanation must be found in
one of those fields. It is- a woman. The fact that it was
not a woman, or very probably is not a woman, is imma
terial. A curiosity is satisfied; and papers are sold.
Some will hold that the city papers are acting in an
unethical manner. Some will say it is unfair to splatter
mud on the dead boy and on Stanford. And in theory, they
are correct.
Hut what some forget is that a city paper is a business
like manufacturing cigarettes, a slaughterhouse, or a
pop-corn stand. The continual efflorescent praise that the
tobacco companies hand themselves is also unethical; but
it sells cigarettes. That to them is important.
Newspaper ethics are 110 higher than the ordinary busi
ness. Each wants to sell a product; each does everything
within the law to realize that end. Only on a college news
paper where the business consideration is most secondary
can commercial ethics be abandoned with anv chance of
survival.
