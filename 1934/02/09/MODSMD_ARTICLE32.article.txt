# Caroline Decker Typewriter Fund
## 
### 
Last quarter, there was all sorts of excitement down
in the fertile valleys of California. The pickers wanted
higher wages and the ranchers claimed they couldn't pay
higher wages. To the valleys went Caroline Decker,
youngish, blondish, wildish strike-organizer.
The workers welcomed her. The ranchers hated her.
Being neither rancher nor worker, we choose not to enter
into the controversy over whether this little lady is to he
haled or welcomed. We do know that this former Brvn
Mawr lassie has exceptional ability. She ran around from
ranch to ranch, finally had wages raised.
And in running around, she made swell news. She gave
the Daily two of its best news stories in many a month.
We appreciate her service.
Now, she is in need—of a typewriter;* and a fund is
being raised to purchase one for her. The Daily has of
fered to forward any campus contributions to the Fund
Headquarters in Carmel.
Besides being the Joan of Arc of the cotton pickers,
Miss Decker is a blonde. The combination is too great to
withstand.
Then, again, we are afraid Miss Decker might organize
the Daily minions. Imagine our embarrassment if tlie
Daily shack were placarded with: Down with Capitalism!

Yes, Miss Decker, if you need a typewriter, the Daily
will be most willing to forward any campus collections.
