# Get Out of the Rat Maze
## 
### 
Yesterday, the Daily had a huneli that i( was not in
the maze of preferential voting misunderstandings. To
day, that hunch is continued by Charles Karl, election
hoard chairman.
The story on page one clearly shows (we hope) that the
sly practices are a waste of time and may result in a waste
of votes. You do not aid your candidate by failing to give
the second best man your second choice. It may appear
that you are aiding a rival by giving him a second choice;
but he only gains hv your second choice if your man,
Friday, is eliminated from the running. Before your man,
Friday, is eliminated, your second choices do not count for
anybody.
The electorate can now heed the word of Karl, and the
l)\u.v too if il does not mind heeding a newspaper, and
crawl out of the maze that politicians have woven out of
political intrigue.
