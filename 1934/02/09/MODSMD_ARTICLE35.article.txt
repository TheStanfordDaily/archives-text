## ANOTHER IRATE GRAD TO THE PRINTS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
You may have noticed that a grad
uate student may be out—of college,
but he (or she) is never down—
ward about expressing himself. Even
though, as was meekly pointed out
once, he may tay nothing.
The particular nothing we have on
our respected cranium today is
nothing against anyone. It [.<■: rather a
burning desire to express a com
mendation of that much maligned
department of the Daily, "The Re
viewer." Much has been made over
the controversy, yet a much needed
praise has been but faintly said. To
speak more specificially; we enjoy
(as a whole) the resumes and criti
cisms presented of the movies, play;-,
and operas which we are unable to
see. Again, we usually approve of,

although we do not always agree en
tirely with ihose reports of things
which we have the fortune to at
tend.
And most particularly we enjoy
the writings of Miss Chapin, often
condemned. A case in point might
be her recent discussion of "Distant
Drums." Miss Chapin gives very
penetrating treatments to her sub
jects; when she says little she at least
has the grace 1o say it decisively and
entertainingly. She has a thorough
knowledge of the art of covering
much briefly, ; nd recognizcs not only
faults but ihe facts at the base oi
those faults.
So a cheer for "The Reviewer,"
and also for the amazing lack of
contumely pervading the spirits of,
—"Another Irate Grad"
