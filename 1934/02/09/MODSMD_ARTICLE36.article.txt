# C. & G. OPINIONSâ€”A FOUNTAIN OF JOY
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Last fall this campus was startled
out of ils general apathy toward its
student organizations by a group of
women leaders who attempted to
vitalize an organization which they
considered no longer served a use
ful purpose. Convinced that such a
society jus Cap and Gown ought to be
composed of women so mature that
they would not content themselves
with merely bestowing empty hon
ors upon their members, these dis
senters proposed a plan for making
use of the talents of the group. At
the same time they brought charges
c f petty preferences in election
which bare the name of ctn honor
society. This stand on the question
was made public. Naturally, the in
terest of the cpmpus was aroused.
However, those of us who read
their arguments withheld judgment
until the other side should have pre
sented their case. In answer to the
question of its usefulness the only
forthcoming reply seems to be a
vague summary concerning the de
sirability of obtaining a '"broader

viewpoint" and the benefits to be
obtained by companionship within
the group.
In the recent election it appeared
that not every girl taken had ful
filled the requirements for the mem -
bership as announced at the time of
the election. If the purpose of Cap
and Gown is social, why not admit
the fact or else present some other
definite reason for existing.
Surely, the charges pertaining to
the politics involved in elections are
serious enough to warrant cither a
defense or in explanation, especially
so, since th?y came from girls who
have merited much respect in. their
other activities. Why has Cap and
Gown refused the challenges pre
sented them? The excuse of dig
nified aloofness from criticism is
surely no longer a valid one in face
of the wide discussion aroused by
the splitup. Those of us who have
heard the arguments of the dissenters
feel that some statement, from the
other side is due us. It's too late to
pretend that nothing has happened.
Very sincerely yours,
Florence Cohen
