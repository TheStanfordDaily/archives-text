# Giusti Convicted
## 
### 
First degree murder, with leni
ency, was tlie verdict returned in
Redwood City yesterday against
Umberto Giusti, impressario, for the
slaying of Emilia Da Prata, singer.
With the spectators and Giusti in
tears, judge and jury dry-eyed, the
wet-eyed defense made its final plea,
showed killing as an accident, asked
manslaughter or acquittal; the state
claimed cowardice and malice, asked
for the death penalty. They missed,
but drew life.
