AGGIE APPLEBY, Maker of Men
(RKO)
DUCK SOUP (Paramount)
Overcoming from the start the
handicap of a name that is decidedly
not "box-office," this play soon re
solves itself into a delightfully amus
ing comedy capable of bringing a
chuckle to even the most pessimistic
theatre-goer, unfolding as it does
the tale of a girl who needs must
play the role of Fate by remolding
the characters of the two mtn in her
life.
Wynne Gibson, as Aggie Appleby,
treats her part with a deft sensitive
ness and realism, while William Gar
gan and Charles Farrell, the two men
Aggie loves, are so convincing one is
hardly conscious that, after all, their
portrayals are only acting. Farrell
in particular, as the meek, rather
effete descendant of a family num
bering senators, soldiers, and Con
gressmen among its members, gives
what is perhaps the finest character
ization of nis career when he is
transformed by Annie's magic into
a pugnacious, devil-may-care fel
low who strides out to meet life
more than half way.
ZaSu Pitts, for once not silly,
amusingly portrays the part, of An
nie's best friend, a chambermaid,
and Betty Furness, as the girl Far
rell leaves behind, is excellent in the
very minor part she is given.
While not all that might be de
sired for intellectual stimulation,
this play has what it takes to afford
an evening of enjoyment and relaxa
tion.
Duck Soup, the accompanying pic
ture, features the four Marx broth
ers and is good if one enjoys the un

predictable antics of Groucho, Har
po, Chico, and Zeppo. It starts off
well but drags so sadly toward the
end that one wishes the Marxes
would call it a day. There is abso
lutely nothing to the picture except
the Marx brethren, and even then
some of their comedy has been bor
rowed from previous attractions.
The music of Kalmar and Ruby is
decidedly below par, and one won
ders why they have departed so far
from their usual high standard.

MEN OF GOOD WILL: The Sixth of
October; Quinette's Crime, by
Jules Romains. (Alfred A. Knopf,
1933.)
This is the first volume of a long
novel in which M. Romains is at
tempting to present a realistic char
acter study, not of a single person
or family group, but of a chameleon
like city: twentieth century Paris.
He accomplishes this through the
device of innumerable characters
and plots, most of which have no re
lation to one another, but weave in
and out until they form the begin
ning of a complicated pattern.
The reader, looking for a story,
may find this decidedly annoying un
t'l he realizes that no character or
theme is of importance in itself, but
is merely a piece in the gigantic
panoramic jig-saw the author is
slowly building. In fact, this book

forms but a small corner of the com
pleted picture.
However, M. Romain's obvious
sympathy with his subject and his
genius for capturing in words ab
stract feelings of movement, of city
atmosphere, of the very heart of life,
bid fair to make his novel, when
complete, one of the outstanding
contributions of our generation io
world literature. —Dahl
