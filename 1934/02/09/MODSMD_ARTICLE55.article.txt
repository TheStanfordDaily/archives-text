# NEW WOMEN GOBBLE MORE CANDY BARS, SET NEW HIGH IN CELLAR STORE SALES
## 
### ANNE RITCHIE 
Maybe it's sweets to the sweet,
or maybe it's sweets to the hungry.
Anyhow, since new women arrived
on the campus and trekked Cellar
wards, 9600 candy bars have been
sold monthly in tl/e Union store,
a total which reaches an all-time
high in campus candy consumption.
Have you had your three love-nut
bars this month, Mame?
The New Woman also chews. Six
thousands packs are sold per month,

I a great increase over last year's gum
sales.
Maybe you can match this one.
During a single month 27,500 books
of safety matches were given away
by the Union. Going into higher
mathematics, twenty matches to
each book means a total of 550,000
free lights circulated on the campus
by the Union alone.
Cigarette sales have not had a
corresponding increase, which indi
cates that the "three-on-a-match
superstition is gaining ground or
else the well-known winds have
been blowing too freely again. The
lights that failed.
