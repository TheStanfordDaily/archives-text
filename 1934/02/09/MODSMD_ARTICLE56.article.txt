# BIDS SELLING FAST FOR VALENTINE TEA
## 
### 
The number of bids left for the
Y..W.C.A.'s benefit tea Tuesday is
rapidly dimnishing, with canvassing
being carried on in the living
groups. The tea to be staged in the
Women's Clubhouse will be not
merely an all-University affair, since
on the committees are Svomen other
than "Y-ers" and men are invited.
The chairmen stress the fact that
outsiders are esjjecially asked.
The tickets for the tea, the hours '
of which are 3 to 6, are priced at
25 cents. The fee includes admis
sion, refreshments, and entertain
ment. Since the Valentine theme is
in power at this season, decorations
and refreshments will come under j
its influence.
Clever and convenient is the
scheme by which bridge tables and
accessories can be loaned for a mod
erate fee. Proceeds from this con
cession, too, will go to fill the bene
fit coffers. Holding the spotlight in
the afternoon's program will be a
fashion review. Mannequins will be
Stanford women who will display
apparel straight from the hands of
the Parisian stylists.
