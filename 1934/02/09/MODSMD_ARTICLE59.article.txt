# BASKETBALL FIVE READY FOR BRUIN INVASION TONIGHT
## Two Games Over Weekend To Decide Standings Of Conference 
### Jolly Cholly 
With third place in the confer
ence race as the stake, Stanford's
varsity basketball team will meet
U.C.L.A.'s visiting Bruins in the j
Pavilion tonight and tomorrow j
night. At the same time, over in j
Berkeley, California and S.C. will j
stage a couple of battles that will |
have a very decisive bearing on the j
championship.
Although Stanford now holds j
second place ill the standings, a j
couple of setbacks at the hands of i
Bruins would shove the Indians I
down (o the cellar, which is an i
eventuality that Coach John Bunn
Mid his crew have no intention of ;
allowing.
Nevertheless, U.C.L.A.'s only vie- !
tory of the season was at the ex- j
pense of Stanford when the Indians ;
made their first southern invasion !
last month. Stanford has improved j
considerably since then, however, I
while the Bruins have not been par- j
ticularly impressive in their four !
losses to California and S.C.
With Cordy Mallatratt, stellar i
guard, still in the hospital yester- !
day with a bad cold, Stanford may '
be weakened somewhat defiensively. |
If Mallatratt is unable to play, A1 j
Page will probably take his place, j
Although Page has shown consider- i
able ability and speed at guard, he
has yet to equal Mallatratt's play. |
Lineup Almost Same
With.,the exception of Mallatratt, ;
Stanford's starting lineup will be the 1
same that has performed in the last j
several games. It consists of Keith j
Topping and Arnie Anderson at for- \
wards, Captain Hal Edelen at cen- i
ter, Charlie Rogers at one guard i
with Page filling in at the other, j
Robin Lindsey will also probably j
see action at guard, while Emil ,
Cowing and Wytze Gorter may
crash in at the forward jjosts.
Although Bunn's quintet will j
naturally be favored against U.C. j
L.A., the Bruins have a number of !
sophomores who may get fired up, ;
as sophomores are wont to do. Cap- j
tain Don Piper, deadeye forward, j
will exert a steadying influence, i
while the rest of the starting lineup â– 
may consist entirely of sophomores. '
Stanfordites will be admitted free j
to bath games on presentation of j
student body cards.
