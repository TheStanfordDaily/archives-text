# INDIANS, DONS HOLD NO-DECISION DEBATE
## 
### 
Yesterday a Stanford varsity de- '
bate team composed of Jack King !
and Eill Merrick defended the neg- ]
ative side of the question: "Re- j
solved, That the powers of the Pres
ident should be increased as a set
tled policy," with a team from San
Francisco University as opposition.
It was a no-decision affair, but the ;
debaters were presented with the !
additional mental hurdle of having
to answer questions from the floor, |
besides refuting the points of the j
opponents.
Dick Van Wagenen, varsity de
bater, acted as chairman.
No-decision debates such as yes- \
terday's Card-Don contest are meet- !
ir.g with a favorable reaction, ac- j
cording to Debate Coach Lee Cha- j
pin. Advantages are precluding the j
possibility of memorized speeches, ,
the necessity for the speakers to
think on their feet.
A return meeting will probably !
take place in San Francisco in the [
near future.
