# YEARLING HOOP QUINTET PLAYS SOUTHERN PREPS
## 
### 
Facing two high school teams in
the preliminaries to the varsity
games, Coach Jimmy Bradshaw's
Card frosh expect to run out their
string of victories to 13 this week
end. Tonight Salinas High will offer
competition, with Fresno High on
tap tomorrow. Both games will start
at 6:30 o'clock.
Salinas, one of the strongest teams
in the coast counties section of the
California Interscholastic Federation,
and runner-up in her league this
year, should be able to push the
Babe reserves, who will open to
night. In case Pickens, aco Salinas
forward, or Layer, in the center of
the court, start ringing the hopper
too frequently, Bradshaw will send
in his first five to pull the game out
of the fire, which they should do
with ease, considering the wallop
ing they administered to Southern
California fives during their barn
storming trip last December.
Frosh Need Practice
Saturday night the Frosh will
meet Fresno High, which will prob
ably offer little competition. To give
experience for possible service in
the final clash with the Cal Cubs
two weeks hence, Bradshaw will
send five of his classiest reserves out
on the floor for the opening whis
tle. What this quintet will lack in
height and weight, no inconsider
able amount, they will make up in
speed and a smooth floor game.
Since seven players, not including
any of the boys who will see serv
ice this week-end, have played
nine-tenths of the basketball for the
Card Frosh since last December, the
reserves are naturally lacking in
experience. However, they have
given the first five, which in turn
has played winning basketball all
season, many a warm practice ses
sion and should little in team
work.
Duncan Improves
Starting at the forward posts will
be two boys who picked up the
game in the original stamping
grounds of baskettball — the Mid
west. Dale Huff is the smallest

member of the squad, but has an
educated eye that should give the
opposing defense plenty of trouble.
A scrappy game played during
I practice sessions of the past two
weeks has won Allan Duncan the
! other forward position, while Ed
Proctor will also see action in this
1 berth.
With little experience but plenty
! of height and a steady floor game,
■ Laßue Smith will hold down the
| center job. Larry Randall and Jim
Dillon will get the call for back
i court, despite their small size. The
offensive system used by the frosh,
with the guards starting the plays,
makes these two smooth ball han
dlers valuable. Lack of height on
defense is compensated in part by
using the lanky Smith under the
bucket, and sending Randall out to
slow down the prep forwards.

game in the original stamping
grounds of baskettball — the Mid
west. Dale Huff is the smallest

member of the squad, but has an
educated eye that should give the
opposing defense plenty of trouble.
A scrappy game played during
I practice sessions of the past two
weeks has won Allan Duncan the
! other forward position, while Ed
Proctor will also see action in this
1 berth.
With little experience but plenty
! of height and a steady floor game,
■ Laßue Smith will hold down the
| center job. Larry Randall and Jim
Dillon will get the call for back
i court, despite their small size. The
offensive system used by the frosh,
with the guards starting the plays,
makes these two smooth ball han
dlers valuable. Lack of height on
defense is compensated in part by
using the lanky Smith under the
bucket, and sending Randall out to
slow down the prep forwards.
Facing two high school teams in
the preliminaries to the varsity
games, Coach Jimmy Bradshaw's
Card frosh expect to run out their
string of victories to 13 this week
end. Tonight Salinas High will offer
competition, with Fresno High on
tap tomorrow. Both games will start
at 6:30 o'clock.
Salinas, one of the strongest teams
in the coast counties section of the
California Interscholastic Federation,
and runner-up in her league this
year, should be able to push the
Babe reserves, who will open to
night. In case Pickens, aco Salinas
forward, or Layer, in the center of
the court, start ringing the hopper
too frequently, Bradshaw will send
in his first five to pull the game out
of the fire, which they should do
with ease, considering the wallop
ing they administered to Southern
California fives during their barn
storming trip last December.
Frosh Need Practice
Saturday night the Frosh will
meet Fresno High, which will prob
ably offer little competition. To give
experience for possible service in
the final clash with the Cal Cubs
two weeks hence, Bradshaw will
send five of his classiest reserves out
on the floor for the opening whis
tle. What this quintet will lack in
height and weight, no inconsider
able amount, they will make up in
speed and a smooth floor game.
Since seven players, not including
any of the boys who will see serv
ice this week-end, have played
nine-tenths of the basketball for the
Card Frosh since last December, the
reserves are naturally lacking in
experience. However, they have
given the first five, which in turn
has played winning basketball all
season, many a warm practice ses
sion and should little in team
work.
Duncan Improves
Starting at the forward posts will
be two boys who picked up the
game in the original stamping
