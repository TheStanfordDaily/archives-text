# BASEBALL COACH PLANS TOUGH GAME TOMORROW
## 
### CHUCK CLANCY 
When the varsity baseball team (
takes the field tomorrow afternoon
i t gainst A1 Erie's All-Star*, Coach
i Harry Woltev will be watching with
' particular interest and apprehension
! the actions of two new starters. It is
j upon this pair that much of the fu
ture strength of the Cards depends.
The two men are Ray Forsyth and
Fred lieringer opening at shortstop
i and in the pitcher's box, respectively.
Starting Forsythe at the shortstop 1
' post is a radical experiment as Wol
! ter continues his search for a capable
man to bolster the weaksst spot on
the Stanford team. Forsythe is no
rookie, having earned his letter last
season in the outfield, but tomor- j
j low's game will mark his first ap
pearance in the infield.
Forsythe Steady
Forsythe has been working out at
this position all fall and has devel- i
I open into a fairly steady fielder, but !
! it is at the plate that he outshines
Clark, Galbraith, and Edwards, the
! regular candidates for the position.
! He garnered plenty of hits last sea- i
I son in his spasmodic appearances in !
the lineup.
Heringer was a regular pitcher on
j the squad last year but throughout
the season he showed one glaring j
j weakness—an inability to go the full j

nine innings without having a bad
streak. If Heringer comes through
against the hard hitting All-Stars
the Cardinal pitching stall will be
well manned.
Stan Anderson, who his already
proven his ability by allowing only
two hits in four innings against the
Athens Club last week, and Herin
ger can form the nucleus of a stx - ong
hurling staff with such men as
"Lefty" Campbell, Eliot Blanchard,
and Armstrong to take care of the
relief work. The last three named
are curve ball pitches and will be
valuable twirlers to replace Ander
son and Heringer who are fast ball
artists,
Ti»e balance of the team will line
up tomorrow with Trcmaine and
Trautman sharing third base du
ties, Woolley at second, Ilearn or
Grayson dividing time at first,
Hamilton in left field, Captain
Dick Miles in center. Nutting in
right, and Massey behind the
plate.
Erie's All-Stars line up as follows:
Shinski, If; Maloney, 2b; Gerran, rf;
Puccinelli, cf; Webber. 3b; Maderas,
ss; Kravis, lb; O'Connell, c; Pres
ton, Luque, or Sullivan on the
mound.
The game will be called at 2:15
o'clock. Admission is free.

ton, Luque, or Sullivan on the
mound.
The game will be called at 2:15
o'clock. Admission is free.
When the varsity baseball team (
takes the field tomorrow afternoon
i t gainst A1 Erie's All-Star*, Coach
i Harry Woltev will be watching with
' particular interest and apprehension
! the actions of two new starters. It is
j upon this pair that much of the fu
ture strength of the Cards depends.
The two men are Ray Forsyth and
Fred lieringer opening at shortstop
i and in the pitcher's box, respectively.
Starting Forsythe at the shortstop 1
' post is a radical experiment as Wol
! ter continues his search for a capable
man to bolster the weaksst spot on
the Stanford team. Forsythe is no
rookie, having earned his letter last
season in the outfield, but tomor- j
j low's game will mark his first ap
pearance in the infield.
Forsythe Steady
Forsythe has been working out at
this position all fall and has devel- i
I open into a fairly steady fielder, but !
! it is at the plate that he outshines
Clark, Galbraith, and Edwards, the
! regular candidates for the position.
! He garnered plenty of hits last sea- i
I son in his spasmodic appearances in !
the lineup.
Heringer was a regular pitcher on
j the squad last year but throughout
the season he showed one glaring j
j weakness—an inability to go the full j

nine innings without having a bad
streak. If Heringer comes through
against the hard hitting All-Stars
the Cardinal pitching stall will be
well manned.
Stan Anderson, who his already
proven his ability by allowing only
two hits in four innings against the
Athens Club last week, and Herin
ger can form the nucleus of a stx - ong
hurling staff with such men as
"Lefty" Campbell, Eliot Blanchard,
and Armstrong to take care of the
relief work. The last three named
are curve ball pitches and will be
valuable twirlers to replace Ander
son and Heringer who are fast ball
artists,
Ti»e balance of the team will line
up tomorrow with Trcmaine and
Trautman sharing third base du
ties, Woolley at second, Ilearn or
Grayson dividing time at first,
Hamilton in left field, Captain
Dick Miles in center. Nutting in
right, and Massey behind the
plate.
Erie's All-Stars line up as follows:
Shinski, If; Maloney, 2b; Gerran, rf;
Puccinelli, cf; Webber. 3b; Maderas,
ss; Kravis, lb; O'Connell, c; Pres
ton, Luque, or Sullivan on the
mound.
