# RAIN AND EXAMS HINDER NOVICE GOLFERS; QUALIFYING ROUNDS NEARLY COMPLETED
## 
### 
Wet weather and mid-quarters I
have taken their toll of prospective
entrants in the reincarnated Novice
golf tournament. The small entry
list should make qualifying espe
cially easy. Twenty cards have been
issued to date, but only thirteen
have been turned in to course offi
cials.
Coach Twiggs expressed displeas
ure at the lethargy of the novices. :
He said that he had recreated the
tournament because of a popular
demand, and that the student body
response thus far had not been suf
ficient to warrant its repetition next
year.
The weather has affected the j
scores which have been turned in
so far to such an extent that posi- j
tions are still wide open for anyone
who tries. Qualifying will be com
pleted by Saturday night. It is
Coach Twiggs' hope that he can

have enough qualify to justify hav
ing a 32-man frame.
As trophy, Twiggs has donated a
set of Hagen Clubs of the latest
make. They are steel-shafted and
have the new brass-plated head.
The qualifications for entry this
year have been enlarged and lib
eralized to allow the admission of a
greater number in the tournament.
Anyone who has not won a trophy
or is not a member of the varsity
and freshman free lists is eligible
for play.
