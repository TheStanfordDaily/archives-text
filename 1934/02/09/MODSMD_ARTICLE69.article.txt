# Floridans Enthusiastic Over Jai Alai Game
## 
### 
i Miami, Florida, is showing great i
| interest in jai alai (hi-li), a new game
from South America, related to
1 handball but so much faster that
, men of 30 cannot stand the pare. The
| fronton (court) is 175 by 40 feet, en
i closed by cement walls on three
I sides. Players hit the pelota (the
size of a baseball, but twice as hard)
against a wall with the casta (a long
i narrow basket like a sugar scoop,
I strapped to the right arm). The re
! suit looks like a combination of ten
! nis and handball.
Princeton freshmen say they pre
| fer Phi Beta Kappa keys to varsity
i letters.
