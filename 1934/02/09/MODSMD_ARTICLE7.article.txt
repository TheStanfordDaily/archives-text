# More Planes?

Citizen-patriot William Mitchell
(Brig.-Gen. before 192G court-mar -
tial) tossed another barbed spear at
army and navy big-wigs—declared
(he U.S. is in "hopeless position to
resist invading air forces" (meaning
Japan, of course).
He pointed out inadequacy of our
planes, gave figures to prove conten
tion, compared these with other na
tions, particularly Italy and Britain,
insulted U.S. Army general staff
once more to be sure they got what
he meant—then raised a further
stink for a separate air corps with a
head ranking as high as the general
staff.
Such an air head could talk when
he wanted to, without being shot
down like Mitchell in 1926. Parting
shot: remarks on graft in Congres
sional air contracts.
