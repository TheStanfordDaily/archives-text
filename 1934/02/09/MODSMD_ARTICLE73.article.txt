# IT'S THE EASY ONES THAT HURT
## 
### 
Bui when the kick is immediately
in front of the goal with an
easy shot at the mark, Lewis inva
riably misses. Two of his poor at
tempts were made in rugby union
games and one in Vancouver.
Lewis thinks he has an explana
tion in the fact that when the goal
posts are taken from an angle they
offer t good sight, hut when they arc
directly before the kicker he has
nothing to aim for .... which makes
Oscar, the office boy, ask if he didn't
see the flaming blond with the green
dress in the fourth row from the top.
