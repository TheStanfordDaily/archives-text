# CARD WATER POLO TEAMS WILL SEEK TITLE AGAINST O.C.
## Conference Championship Depends on Outcome Of Varsity Game 
### Millard Browne 
Tomorrow is Big Game day—and
: Stanford and California aren't even
' meeting.
It is Big Game day for Nort
i Thornton and his varsity and fresh
man water poloists. Both Stanford
teams may win their second conse
j cutive Northern California Water
j Polo League championships at this
time.
Stanford's league leaders engage
! the Olympic Club conference con
! tenders, in two games in the Encina
j pools. The frosh preliminary en
i counter will get under way at 3:30
! o'clock, with the varsity game fol
j lowing at 4:15 o'clock.
Teams Even Match
The varsity teams are evenly
! matched, man for man. Stanford
j boasts better condition; Winged-0
| players compensate by experience.
: The odds are even. Until cc Ids this
' week diminished Stanford's advan
i tage in condition, Coach Nort
j Thornton's Indians had been consid
j ered slight favorites-to repeat a vic
| tory over the Club.
Vlad Taranik, Wally Wiget, and
i Jimmy Triolo have been out of prac
! tiee during the latter part, of the
! week. Taranik, who composes the
greater portion of the Cardinal of
fense, was confined in bed with
bronchitis; he will be on hand Sat
urday, but hi.s speed and endurance
may be affected.
Wiget has been suffering from a
cold, but he will play.
Triolo Crippled
Triolo, who entered the pools last
week for the first time this year, is
troubled with a recurrence of poi
son oak, the ailment which has made
him a cripple as far as aquatic work
this year has been concerned.
If Stanford defeats the San Fran
cisco organization, the Cardinal con
secutive-victory list will be boosted
to 13.
With three former Stanford stars,
Ted Wiget, Whitey Burns, and Elmer
Collett, holding down regular berths
j or. the powerful Club team, the game
| will take on the aspect of an under
[ graduate-alumni tangle. However,
I such foreign additions as Ginger
j Austin and George Mitchell, both
| former members of American Olym
| pic Games teams, may serve to dis
! pel any ideas of a family reunion
I from Indians' minds.
• Team Lineups
The lineups for the varsity game
j probably will be:
Stanford—Taranik, sprint; Jimmy
| Benet and Bob Foster, forwards; Bill
| Woodard, center back; Wally Wiget
i and Captain Gordy Graves, guards;
I Leo Cook, goalie.
Olympic Club—Ted Wiget, sprint;
Austin and Jack Toupe. forwards;
Burns, center back; Mitchell and
Marshall Dunn, guards; Collett,
goalie.
With Stanford's frosh team rated
slight favorites, the preliminary
game will be as important to the
league standings as the varsity. The
Indian yearlings and Olympic Club
Juniors occupy the same positions in
the junior league as do their re
spective varsity squads.
The Card Babes barely won the
first game from the clubmen, and
except for Stanford's offensive im
provement in the past two weeks,
the game would be a toss-up.
The frosh lineup will remain un
changed from last week's game, with
the exception of a certain amount of
doubt as to which goalie will start.
The lineup follows: Captain Bob
Hoover, Ben Voss, and Alex Mac-
Kenzie, forwards; Bob Harris, Don
Peterson, and Pat Pearson, guards;
Bob Haslacher or Jack Scharlin,
Goalie.

the game would be a toss-up.
The frosh lineup will remain un
changed from last week's game, with
the exception of a certain amount of
doubt as to which goalie will start.
The lineup follows: Captain Bob
Hoover, Ben Voss, and Alex Mac-
Kenzie, forwards; Bob Harris, Don
Peterson, and Pat Pearson, guards;
Bob Haslacher or Jack Scharlin,
Goalie.
Tomorrow is Big Game day—and
: Stanford and California aren't even
' meeting.
It is Big Game day for Nort
i Thornton and his varsity and fresh
man water poloists. Both Stanford
teams may win their second conse
j cutive Northern California Water
j Polo League championships at this
time.
Stanford's league leaders engage
! the Olympic Club conference con
! tenders, in two games in the Encina
j pools. The frosh preliminary en
i counter will get under way at 3:30
! o'clock, with the varsity game fol
j lowing at 4:15 o'clock.
Teams Even Match
The varsity teams are evenly
! matched, man for man. Stanford
j boasts better condition; Winged-0
| players compensate by experience.
: The odds are even. Until cc Ids this
' week diminished Stanford's advan
i tage in condition, Coach Nort
j Thornton's Indians had been consid
j ered slight favorites-to repeat a vic
| tory over the Club.
Vlad Taranik, Wally Wiget, and
i Jimmy Triolo have been out of prac
! tiee during the latter part, of the
! week. Taranik, who composes the
greater portion of the Cardinal of
fense, was confined in bed with
bronchitis; he will be on hand Sat
urday, but hi.s speed and endurance
may be affected.
Wiget has been suffering from a
cold, but he will play.
Triolo Crippled
Triolo, who entered the pools last
week for the first time this year, is
troubled with a recurrence of poi
son oak, the ailment which has made
him a cripple as far as aquatic work
this year has been concerned.
If Stanford defeats the San Fran
cisco organization, the Cardinal con
secutive-victory list will be boosted
to 13.
With three former Stanford stars,
Ted Wiget, Whitey Burns, and Elmer
Collett, holding down regular berths
j or. the powerful Club team, the game
| will take on the aspect of an under
[ graduate-alumni tangle. However,
I such foreign additions as Ginger
j Austin and George Mitchell, both
| former members of American Olym
| pic Games teams, may serve to dis
! pel any ideas of a family reunion
I from Indians' minds.
• Team Lineups
The lineups for the varsity game
j probably will be:
Stanford—Taranik, sprint; Jimmy
| Benet and Bob Foster, forwards; Bill
| Woodard, center back; Wally Wiget
i and Captain Gordy Graves, guards;
I Leo Cook, goalie.
Olympic Club—Ted Wiget, sprint;
Austin and Jack Toupe. forwards;
Burns, center back; Mitchell and
Marshall Dunn, guards; Collett,
goalie.
With Stanford's frosh team rated
slight favorites, the preliminary
game will be as important to the
league standings as the varsity. The
Indian yearlings and Olympic Club
Juniors occupy the same positions in
the junior league as do their re
spective varsity squads.
The Card Babes barely won the
first game from the clubmen, and
except for Stanford's offensive im
provement in the past two weeks,
the game would be a toss-up.
The frosh lineup will remain un
