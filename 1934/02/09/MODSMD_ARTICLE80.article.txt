# TEMPLETON ABANDONS FRIDAY PRACTICE MEETS BECAUSE OF LACK OF INTEREST
## 
### 
Friday practice meets, weekly in
stitutions under the track regime of
Coach Dink Templeton for the past
several years are definitely out for
an indefinite period. Templeton lays
the reason of this eradication to
"lack of interest," esepcially, it is
obviously seen, in the runners.
Slow Heats
In the two meets held this quar
ter, track men have not entered in
full force, and even then, there is a
tinge of "loafing" through races at
mediocre speedsâ€”thus the tempo
rary moratorium on squad compe
tition. Time trials, absolutely neces
sary for the development of win
ning runners, will be run off as us
ual, however, but a regular workout
will supplant the meet this after
noon.
Several performances proved en

couraging yesterday. Ray William
son, big, ambitious frosh, tucked the
javelin out on the 180-foot mark,
and threw several around 175; and
as lie has not perfected his step yet,
improvement is imminent. Johnny
Mottram hoisted his new striated
spear easily out 195 feet.
Ben Eastman ran a 48.9 quarter
late in the afternoon. He practically
strode the first 220, and his kick
on the home stretch is a matter of
history. Ben is expccted to break
plenty of tape this year.
Willson Looks Good
Last and not least was the show
ing of Jimmy Willson, the widely
heralded prep sprinter hampered by
the old bugaboo of pulled muscles
in the early part of his college ca
reer. He was out yesterday, stretch
ing out to a fast run after a warm
up jog, and looking all right.
