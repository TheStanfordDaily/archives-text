# El Capitan Quint Cools Toro Basketeers Phi Sigs, El Campo, S.A.E. Win Contests
## 
### WARREN BREED 
As Mural Manager Marvie Kahn
puts it, El Toro was "shoved off its
pinnacle"—alluding to their defeat
last night by the El Capitan quin
tet. Capitari, led by two demon lit
tle forwards, Rode and Weeks, who
tallied 27 of the total 32 between
them, came up late after Toro had
led at half-time, 20-11, and capital
ized on the ragged Toro floorwork.
In another thriller, Phi Sigma
Kappa managed to win over Se
quoia 11, 23-24, after putting the
game in the ice box at half with 20-
10. Phi Sig's Nelson tallied 16 points
in the first half but was completely
bottled up thereafter, leaving the
scoi'ing to teammate Worley.
Smooth play by Bacon of El Cam
po and nice shooting gave the club
a decisive win over Kappa Sigma,
while the A.T.O.'s were smothered
by S.A.E.
