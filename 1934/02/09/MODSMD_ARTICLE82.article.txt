# IMPROVED FRESHMEN TACKLE SAN MATEO
## Babes Meet Junior College Nine Here Tomorrow 
### 
With each practice session bring
ing on more polish, Ernie Nevers'
| Stanford freshman baseball team will
cross bats in their third game of the
I season tomorrow morning with the
San Mateo Junior College Bulldogs.
| The game will start at 10 o'clock.
The Card yearling outfield is be
! ginning to judge flies with more pre
cision, the infield is gaining some
| co-ordination, and footwork, and the
battery is improving. Against a
weak San Mateo High School last
Tuesday, Stanford really .showed
i potentialities; against McClynionds
i High School lasl week-end, the In
; dians looked pitiful in every depart
ment.
The San Mateo team has just be
gun practice, and tomorrow's game
| will open the Bulldog season. The
1 San Mateans, however, are always
i strong contenders in the Northern
| California J.C. Conference, and they
; have a veteran group with which to
build this year.
Nevers has made no definite an
! nouncement as to his starling lineup
His battery will be chosen from
Lanson Davis, Albert Brent, and Jim
j Senders, pitchers; Mike Feiro and
; Louis Tsoutsouvas, catchers.
