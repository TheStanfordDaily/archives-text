# ROBINSON LECTURE TO HONOR LINCOLN ON RADIO MONDAY
## Will Discuss Preservation Of Democracy Ideal 
### 
Commemorating the anniversary
of Abraham Lincoln's birth, Profee
soi Edgar Eugene Robinson will
honor the "Great Emancipator" in
Monday's edition of the Stanford
radio series, heard on station KPO
at 7:45 o'clock. Realizing that to ,
every lover of his country Lincoln !
stands as the symbol of American I
democracy, Professor Robinson will
take for his theme the topic "Lin
coln and Americanism."
Professor Robinson holds the Mar
garet Byrne Chair of American His
tory at Stanford, and has taught j
here for over twenty years.
Last year he was selected by a
committee of younger alumni to \
open their conference on Social and
Economic Trends, an experiment <
which is to be repeated under the â€¢
auspices of the Alumni Association.
The meeting is to be held March
10 and 11 of this year.
Preservation of the ideal of po
litical democracy in the intricacies
of modern civilization presents a
task that only a prepared and pa
triotic citizen body can cope with,
believes Professor Robinson, and it
is certain that his speech will pro
vide plenty of room for speculation
in the mind of the thinking man.
A bicycle club has just been or
j ganized at the University of Ala
bama.
