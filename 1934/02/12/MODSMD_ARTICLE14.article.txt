# ROBINSON WILL SPEAK TONIGHT ON RADIO HOUR
## 'Lincoln and Americanism' Is Topic of Weekly Stanford Lecture 
### 
Recognizing that to every lover
of his country Lincoln is the sym
bol of democracy, Professor Edgar
Eugene Robinson will speak on
"Lincoln and Americanism" dur
ing the Stanford University Hour
over radio station KPO at 7:45
o'clock tonight.
As the Margaret Byrne Profes
sor of American History, Professor
Robinson has taught for over 20
years at the University, and his in
fluence over successive generations
of history students has been great.
Food for Thought
Professor Robinson believes that
the democratic ideal of the United
States calls for the active co-opera
tion of intelligent men and women,
and it is certain that his talk will
provide much food for thought for
the leaders of the country. He is
convinced that only a prepared and
patriotic citizen body can cope with
the task of preserving our democ
racy in the face of intricate prob
lems presented by our modern civi- j
lization.
Younger alumni of the Univer
sity last year chose him to open
their conference on Social and Eco
nomic Trends, an experiment which
will be repeated under the auspices
of the Alumni Association on March
10 and 11 of this year.
Interesting Method
An example of his method of
teaching history is given by a state
ment made at that time in which he
said, "Hopes and aspirations come
not from surveys of facts but rather
seem to have sprung from a faith in
the high destiny of man and of this
nation."

talks sponsored by the University,
Professor Robinson's speech fol
lows those of such authorities as
Bailey Willis, professor emeritus of
geology; Theodore Kreps, profes
sor of statistics in the Graduate

stitute, and Jesse Sears, professor
of education.

professor of anatomy.
Recognizing that to every lover
of his country Lincoln is the sym
bol of democracy, Professor Edgar
Eugene Robinson will speak on
"Lincoln and Americanism" dur
ing the Stanford University Hour
over radio station KPO at 7:45
o'clock tonight.
As the Margaret Byrne Profes
sor of American History, Professor
Robinson has taught for over 20
years at the University, and his in
fluence over successive generations
of history students has been great.
Food for Thought
Professor Robinson believes that
the democratic ideal of the United
States calls for the active co-opera
tion of intelligent men and women,
and it is certain that his talk will
provide much food for thought for
the leaders of the country. He is
convinced that only a prepared and
patriotic citizen body can cope with
the task of preserving our democ
racy in the face of intricate prob
lems presented by our modern civi- j
lization.
Younger alumni of the Univer
sity last year chose him to open
their conference on Social and Eco
nomic Trends, an experiment which
will be repeated under the auspices
of the Alumni Association on March
10 and 11 of this year.
Interesting Method
An example of his method of
teaching history is given by a state
ment made at that time in which he
said, "Hopes and aspirations come
not from surveys of facts but rather
seem to have sprung from a faith in
the high destiny of man and of this
nation."

lows those of such authorities as
