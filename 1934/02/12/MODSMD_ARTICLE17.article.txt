# Steffens Requests Rolph Money For Decker Fund
## Letter to Governor Tells of Strike Leader's Need For Typewriter to Aid in Labor Agitation 
### 
Sunny Jim Rolph, who unconsciously supplies the type of humor "in
high places" that Lincoln Steffens consciously uncovers, has been re
quested by Steffens to contribute to the Caroline Decker Typewriter
Fund. His letters to Rolph follows:
Dear Governor:
Pursuant of my unpromising experimental probing for humor
in high places, I am going to ask you to contribute personally a
dollar or so toward a fund to buy a typewriter for Caroline
Decker, the tiny little labour agitator who is doing what no big
A. F. of L. leader has ever dared undertake; to organize the mi
gratory workers of the lovely orchards and vegetable ranches of
California. You remember her! She is the so-called ama/.on who
led the workers in their well-led strikes for a living wage in the
valleys last year. She has to carry on the struggle this year, and
next year, and the next. She thinks she can make consumers,
citizens, and human beings out of these peon producers. An auda
cious experiment, as dubious as mine, and therefore worth boost
ing. But she hasn't even a typewriter to make clear to us and to
the workers, the strategic plans she draws.
Let's help her to a machine. I will if you will. You might in
duce some of the impartial police, personally, to join us; Chief
Cato, for example. I may ask some picked ranchers to come in on
it and your Mr. Secretary Smith could invite the highbrow news
papermen he sees daily. They might have a sense of humor.
If the fund should exceed the price of one cheap typewriter
I'll keep the difference for the purchase of another if the first one
should be wrecked in some righteous aid.
Yours solemnly,
LINCOLN STEFFENS
StciTens, America's No. 1 reporter, spoke at Stanford last year, is self
namcd chairman, secretary, and TREASURER of the Caroline Decker
Typewriter Fund.
