Well aware that the broad seat he
occupies in Sacramento is in danger
this fall, gladhanding Governor
Jimmy set out last week to tour the
state's 58 counties. Purpose: to
mend political fences, practice the
famous handshake. When last heard
from, he was Â»n Kern County,
headed south to woo more voters.
Not to he outdone, other G.O.P.
candidates Johnson and Merriam
were hustling about too. Meanwhile,
Democrats were muffing their splen
did chances by haggling over can
didates. Leaders hoped party poli
tician Farley would point to Moses.
