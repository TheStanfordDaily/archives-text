# France Strikes
## 
### 
Promptly at midnight last night
millions of French proletarians
struck all over the nation. Nearly
all trains, taxis, mail stopped; streets
were deserted, most shops closed.
Socialists, labor leaders, Commu
nists had declared a general 24-
hour strike as a protest against Fas
cist methods Doumergue's strong
man government is supposed to be
contemplating.
Soldiers and police guarded pub
lic utility services, plants lest syn
dicalist-advocated sabotage occur.
Most observers agree that national
lifo will be crippled , for today at
least. Meanwhile the popular "Gas
tonnet" and his cabinet were out
wardly calm, aware that the very
dictatorial methods objected to are
exactly what most Frenchmen want
at present, hope will mean a strong
stand against a re-armed Germany.
