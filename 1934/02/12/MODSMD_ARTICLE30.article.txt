# BIG DOINGS IN WASHINGTON
## 
### 
While F. H. Roosevelt was telling the Hoy Scouts of
America what "vve scouts" should do, several mighty
things were happening in Washington. First, the air-mail
contracts were canceled, and buried beneath that sensa
tional storv was the less sensational, hut more important,
storv that a new Communications Commission will be cre
ated.
The first storv means simply that Roosevelt has exer
cised Ihe presidential power of canceling contracts tainted
with fraud. That this fraud was uncovered in a congres
sional investigation rather than in a court room will bother
some. The majority, not caring about grandiose phrases
like fundamental American rights, will feel that the Presi
dent has acted rapidly, and rapid action is what people
want.
In ordinary times, the Presidential action would prob
ably be considered revolutionary if not an open sell-out
to the reds. But what few will bring themselves to speak
out is that American government is changing and the only
limit to the change seems to he the lite-line ol the depres
sion. Should this mighty phenomenon drag on for several
more years, we will see American Fascism, though orators
will declare that the terms are inherently contradictory.
We are not damning the President. Control is neces
sary and he is exercising it. We do not even blame the
President for still speaking in the old terms, for few people
would follow him under new banners but the mass will
follow him anywhere as long as they can hear the old
battle-cries, democracy, constitution, etc., ringing in their
ears.
The formation of a Communications Commission to
replace the Radio Commission and to control, with radio,
cable and telegraph lines as well, is a latent control over
the press. If the government can tell cable editors what
news will go over the wires as the present Radio Commis
sion dictates what goes over the air, free press becomes
another beautiful phrase in the history books. That has
not yet happened but is not beyond possibility.
The majority stake all on material prosperity and they
will not care what is done to realize it. Roosevelt knows
that.
