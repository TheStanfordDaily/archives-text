Stanford's athletic orphan lias ridden to another pair
of victories during the week-end.
The Stanford polo team has a unique position in the
University. The players furnish their own equipment; the
Army furnishes Captain Gordon, the coach; and the team
has the peculiar habit of winning nearly every one of its
contests.
So consistent have been their victories that they will
travel to Los Angeles in two weeks to play Arizona for
what is the unotlicial intercollegiate title of the West. The
University will not even hear this expense â€” the Junior
Chamber of Commerce of Los Angeles footing the bill.
The entire sport of polo used to cost the B.A.C. the
staggering sum of ijvJOO a year. When'the B.A.C. was swim
ming in the red, there probably was reason for jettisoning
any expense. But now that happy football days are here
again, it would only seem fair that these fellows be fur
nished their equipment and traveling expenses like every
other sport.
As an orphan, polo has interested fifty students,
brought fame to the campus. Once given the well-feath
ered arm of the B.A.C. to lean upon, it will grow and pros
per. Growth and prosperity are to he encouraged.
