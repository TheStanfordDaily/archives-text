# Buried or a Walking Death?
## 
### 
Tomorrow, students will have the opportunity of de
ciding whether or not they will retain card stunts at fool
hall games. II is surprising how little the campus cares
one way or the other. We seriously wonder whether stu
dents will care enough to vote on the matter when the
ballot is literally, as well as figuratively, pushed under
their noses.
Valid argument for the stunts seems to he singularly
lacking. Personally, we have never been-able to observe
the stunts. The Rally Committee tells us, however, that
they do not appear attractive. It seems that our student
body is too small to really make an effective section. And
personally, we would rather go out and eat peanuts dur
ing the half, anyway.
