# Candidates Lend an Ear
## 
### 
It may be a sham and all that, but we will try it any
way. All candidates for K\ Committee, Men's Council, and
R.A.C. positions are asked to have at the Daily office a
short statement (about 100 words) regarding their plat
form, ideas about themselves, the office they hope to ob
tain, etc.
The Daily hopes by printing them that more intelligent
balloting may result. We are ever hopeful.

The Daily staff will meet today at 1:15 o'clock. It is
most essential that all attend. Rig brewings (non-alcoholic,
non-gustatorv) promised for all.
