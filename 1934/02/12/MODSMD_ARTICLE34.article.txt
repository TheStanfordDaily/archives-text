## MAMMON VS. A.S.S.U.—TWO MASTERS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Open letter to all students;
| Can a man serve two masters?
Regarding the candidacy of a cer
| tain incumbent, seeking re-election
| in the coming university election,
| we, the undersigned, fee 1 that a
| situation has arisen calling for a fair
! and open discussion. Such discus
j sion calls first for clarification of ihe
! following points:
1. The B.A.C. student member,
! '
J as the name implies, is the repre-
Lsensative of the students on the
! Board of Athletic Control.
2. The Board of Athletic Control
I is the employer of the graduate ma-
I nager. j
3. The graduate manager appoints '
I the student manager, the latter re
ceiving a salary as long as he serves i
; his job efficiently.
i Can the present student manager, 1
j who is seeking re-election as stu
| dent manager of the 8.A.C., sue
i cessfully and loyally serve the in-
I'interests of the student hotly? ;
[ cially when those interests might I
possibly call upon him to vote
against the inclinations of the grad- j
uate manager, from whom he re- i
! ceived the job paying him his sal- l
| ary.
When two positions make such
j conflicting claims upon a man, it, is :
i our feeling that the subtle pressure I

of a salary though possibly unrec
ognized by its victim, will swerve
his judgment in matters calling for
unbiased decision. Ii was the fttct
of these considerations that led the
official Hall caucus to reject the
candidacy of "Abe" Hables as stu
dent member of the Board of Athle
tic Control.
This is not the attempt of a small
group to subversively influence
campus opinion. Nor is it a poisoned
arrow aimed at the personal quali
fications of this candidate.
Simply stated, it .'.s the valid re
action against the impossibility of
conflicting interests resting in one
individual.
Signed,
Ralph Lui, '31
Ed Boyles, '32
P.S.—After this was written we
were informed i:hat "Abe" Hables
has declined the nomination dis
cussed above, but we are requesting
that this letter be lun nevertheless
to point out the need for a consti
tutional change so that this possi
bility of conflicting of interests can
be avoided in the future.
Editor's Note —The Daily cannot
enter into the personalities of stu
dent elections, will print objeciive
Campus Opinions about individuals,
will not print bittsr personal at
tacks on candidates.
