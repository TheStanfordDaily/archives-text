# HONEST HAL FOR HONEST GRAFT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
For years and year and years
graft has run rampant, rampant I
repeat, within the halls of our fair
University where waft the gentle
breezes of freedom, and it is high
time that the voters, you and you
and you, rise in wrath and banish
this nefarious secret crookedness
forever from our beloved "Farm,"
as it has come to be known. Nasty,
nasty graft. Secret undercover graft!
Graft must be exposed if the lair
name of our student body is to be
preserved.
Beetlebrowed, bespectacled von
Breton is the man ior the job. Said
wide-eyed, funnyman "Skeets" von
Breton when reached late last nigh I
under a Dinah's Shack table: "Graft
must be exposed. In anticipation of
my coming election I have pur
chased six reams of graft paper for

I this purpose. My graft will be hon
| est graft. I will publish a weekly
1 graft report. Then you will know
WHY I will get Bill Bonsall ap
pointed chairman of the flower com
mittee. I'll even tell on my best
friends. Nasty graxt has got to be
exposed."
"Honest Hal for Honest Graft," is
the machine slogan. Climb onto the
1 bandwagon, voters, the Big, Green
Bandwagon. Just think! you too
might be the lucky one and get your
own bit of patronage. All you have
jto do is cross your fingers, close
your eyes and pray. "A vote for
Honest Hal is a vote for Honest
Hal."
"Honest Hal," backed by the hu
mor machine, is also running on a
i write-in ballot for BA.C. He also
thinks A.S.S.U. vice pres. is a pretty
soft job.
