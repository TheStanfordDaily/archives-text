# WE WANT "MUSSOLINI"

### 
The Editor, Sir:
The humorist's machine is smooth
ly, silently reaching out for power.
The boys ai'e out to get results, and
they're going to get 'em under
beetle-browed ''Spider" Coonradt,
the machine's nominee for the vice
presidency of '34.
Yesterday I was talking to myself
about what election would mean to
us, the Spider gave me the cold
dope. Said he: "This campus needs
a Mussolini, somebody with a good
bunch of ward-heelers, somebody
who can crack the whip and get 'em
on the boat. That's what I'm going
to be when I'm the Mussolini. I've
got as smooth and powerful a ma
chine as ever hit the campus. I have

the philosophical vote and the Com
munist vote.
"I just promised the patronage.
That's all you got to do.
"Yep," said "Boss" Coonradt, "we
are putting it over by getting every
body in the organization. All they
have to do is vote right. Then we'll
fix 'em up with a committee. What
a party the machine will have when
it gets into office."
Well, Mr. Editor, that's good stuff.
It's something to ha>'e a good de
pendable caucus behind you (or
even a frosh caucus) but it's better
to have a patronage machine. That's
efficient. Vote for "Spider" Coon
radt who makes no bones (about
it). He's a Mussolini.
