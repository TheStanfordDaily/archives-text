# WOMAN HATER IRKED BY EDITOR, WOMAN

### 
Tiie Editor, Sir:
The recent incidents which have
resulted in unflattenng publicity for
certain women are indeed to be de
plored; and, in fact, to be viewed
with alarm if an indication as to
what is coming next. The sorority
pledging episodes, as usual, came in
for their share of notoriety. That
was to be expected. It would be an
unkindness to the editor to deprive
him of such a fertile subject.
But the publicity which attended
the C. & G. fiasco was entirely un
warranted. Granting that they acted
in good faith, the original withdraw
crs, as reasonable people (which the
ex-president admits they were),
could have foreseen what, a child
ishly immature action they were
doing and what unfavorable and
personal publicity would result

therefrom.
The exhibitionism of the woman
on the Law steps was bad enough,
but so-called poem by the girl
with the pilot's license was the last
word in puerile inanity.
While no one claimed that the
noble "500" were leaving beauties,
they did set a standard of poise,
maturity, and intellectual woman
hood which raised the prestige of
the Stanford woman to a high level
in the eyes of the world. That pres
tige lowers in direct proportion as
the unseemingly publicity seeking
increases.
Mr. Editor, please do not think
that such old-fashioned ideals and
doctrines are intended to discourage
any group of sweet young things
who may desire to form another
honor society (membership to be

based on any vague, intangible
characteristic), with a meeting place
on the Law steps, for the purpose
of writing poems vaingloriously
lauding their own achievements.
Sincerely,
Another Law Grad
