EL-WYN'S SPOOK SHOW
At the Stanford Theatre
Ingenuity with concealed wires
and threads, courage before a tough
audience, and knowledge of a few
psychological phenomena made El-
Wyn a successful magician, if not a
spiritualist. The climax of last Sat
urday evening came in utter dark
ness when luminous Shapes and
weird Things were swooping over
the audience: six or seven fellows
jumped a ghost rising from the or
chestra pit, and held him until the
lights went on.
Best effect: hideous laughter in
the dark, from an amplifier back
stage.
A Shriek in the Night, in spite of
poor photography, poor direction,
and frequently aimless dialogue, is
thrilling because of the very horror
of the situation itself. After four
murders in the first three reels, you
know who the murderer is, and the
rest of the picture is suspense: Will
the police get the vjllain before the
villain gets the girl? The villain's
manner of walking is the most hid
eous aspect, and the comedy maid
outdoes all other comedy maids.

| THE DARK TOWER, By Alexander i
Woollcott and George S. Kaufman, j
Random House, 1934.
! At the Stanford Bookstore
I Amusing lines and very clever j
| denouement nuke this self-styled i
i "Melodrama" far more than an av-
I erage melodrama, even in the read
j ing of it. Obviously a box office
1 affair, it has many more virtues than
| the usual popular melodrama.
The villain is ihe only stock chnr
j acter, and he is not disposed of un- :
! til well into Act 11, leaving the |
| others to what appears destined to !
; be a routine ending and what ac- I
j tually proves a very deft solution. !
j The other characters are all inter
! esting: the heroine ;s a noted actress j
j ensnared by a scoundrel husband, ;
while her brother a clevc-r actor j
| with a facility for good lines, while I
i the lively old maid aunt, the uni- ;
j que murderer, and the accorssory j
| characters are all useful.
The dialogue is exceptionally fa- '
cile and entertaining in the best j
Kaufman tradition, frequently wilty
1 and occasionally vulgar; and it ]
i serves well to fill in the lapses in ;
: action. Among the better bits arc a i
sly jab at Noel Cov/ard and a not- '
1 so-sly one at Lionel Atwill.
