# O.C.-STANFORD TIE GIVES LOOP TITLE TO CLUB RUGGERS
## 
### Spud Hamilton 
The' good light toe of Blister
Holmes, former Stanford fullback, I
gained an 8-8 tic for ihe Olympic
Club Saturday in their rugby game i
with Stanford and thereby won the i
Northern California Rugby Union i
title for the Club. In the closing I
minutes of a strangely long last half j
Holmes made good on the third of |
a series of penalty kicks imposed on
the Indians and brqught the Olym
pians, previously trailing 8-5, into j
a tie.
The O-C's 15 veterans, far from j
•fagging out as the game progressed,
appeared fresher toward the end ,
than in the opening play, and were \
deep in Stanford territory most oi j
the final minutes. Fred Schlicting !
at left wing for the Club twice sped j
across the corner of the goal line j
for apparent tries twice to be called j
back for stepping out of bounds.
Fullbacks Strong
Stanford opened strong with Bus- j
ter Holmes and Waddy White, re- j
spective fullbacks, doing heavy duty, j
O.C. penetrated the Stanford de- j
fense with a good kick of Holmes j
that found touch on the Red five- I
yard line, and a few minutes later !
White had an opportunity to kick a
Jong one that rolled out on the
O.C. 20.
On the ensuing lineout, Ben Pala
mountain picked up the ball anel
struggled through a flock of tack
ier.? for a try. Ray Lewis missed j
the convert from an extreme angle j
and Stanford led 3-0.
Clubmen Lead
The Olympians immediately i
fought their way down the field
and from a scrum on the Stanford
five-yard line shoved the ball over
to allow Skin Brewer to touch it I
down for an Olympic try which j
Holmes converted to give the club- j
men a 5-3 lead.
Ben Palamountain gave the stands I
a thrill .shortly afterwards, when |
he broke loose on a GO-yard run j
that seemed sure to score, until j
Brick Marcus, cutting across field,
brought him down on the O.C. 10-
yarcl mark.
Joe Vigna started the second In
dian try by breaking up an O.C.
passing rush with an interception to
Start Stanford rush that found
Frank Bansbach all handling the
ball, with Lewis finally scoring.
He converted his own score and
Stanford led 8-5 at the half.
Good Passing
Stanford came through with some
good passing rushes in the second
half and came within inches of
scoring several times. One neat
rush with George Wyman, Rod
Lewis, Bansbach, and Roger Hager
all handling the ball ended over the
line but was called back to the five
yard mark.
The Olympians began to press
hard and held Stanford in a hole
long enough to earn penalty kicks
called on three occasions. Holmes
missed the first, from the 30, the
second from the '10, and booted
the third clean from an easy shot
directly before the goal posts.
Holmes again saved his team
when Johnny Rcisner found an
opening to race through 14 of the
clubmen only to be dragged clown
on the O.C. 40-yard line by Holmes.
Stanford has two sl ; m chances to
win near the end of that long half
on penalty kicks from long, hard
angles, but belli missed.

The' good light toe of Blister
Holmes, former Stanford fullback, I
gained an 8-8 tic for ihe Olympic
Club Saturday in their rugby game i
with Stanford and thereby won the i
Northern California Rugby Union i
title for the Club. In the closing I
minutes of a strangely long last half j
Holmes made good on the third of |
a series of penalty kicks imposed on
the Indians and brqught the Olym
pians, previously trailing 8-5, into j
a tie.
The O-C's 15 veterans, far from j
•fagging out as the game progressed,
appeared fresher toward the end ,
than in the opening play, and were \
deep in Stanford territory most oi j
the final minutes. Fred Schlicting !
at left wing for the Club twice sped j
across the corner of the goal line j
for apparent tries twice to be called j
back for stepping out of bounds.
Fullbacks Strong
Stanford opened strong with Bus- j
ter Holmes and Waddy White, re- j
spective fullbacks, doing heavy duty, j
O.C. penetrated the Stanford de- j
fense with a good kick of Holmes j
that found touch on the Red five- I
yard line, and a few minutes later !
White had an opportunity to kick a
Jong one that rolled out on the
O.C. 20.
On the ensuing lineout, Ben Pala
mountain picked up the ball anel
struggled through a flock of tack
ier.? for a try. Ray Lewis missed j
the convert from an extreme angle j
and Stanford led 3-0.
Clubmen Lead
The Olympians immediately i
fought their way down the field
and from a scrum on the Stanford
five-yard line shoved the ball over
to allow Skin Brewer to touch it I
down for an Olympic try which j
Holmes converted to give the club- j
men a 5-3 lead.
Ben Palamountain gave the stands I
a thrill .shortly afterwards, when |
he broke loose on a GO-yard run j
that seemed sure to score, until j
Brick Marcus, cutting across field,
brought him down on the O.C. 10-
yarcl mark.
Joe Vigna started the second In
dian try by breaking up an O.C.
passing rush with an interception to
Start Stanford rush that found
Frank Bansbach all handling the
ball, with Lewis finally scoring.
He converted his own score and
Stanford led 8-5 at the half.
Good Passing
Stanford came through with some
good passing rushes in the second
half and came within inches of
scoring several times. One neat
rush with George Wyman, Rod
Lewis, Bansbach, and Roger Hager
all handling the ball ended over the
line but was called back to the five
yard mark.
The Olympians began to press
hard and held Stanford in a hole
long enough to earn penalty kicks
called on three occasions. Holmes
missed the first, from the 30, the
second from the '10, and booted
the third clean from an easy shot
directly before the goal posts.
Holmes again saved his team
when Johnny Rcisner found an
opening to race through 14 of the
clubmen only to be dragged clown
on the O.C. 40-yard line by Holmes.
Stanford has two sl ; m chances to
win near the end of that long half
on penalty kicks from long, hard
angles, but belli missed.
