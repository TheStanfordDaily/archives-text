## 
### Mort D'Evelyn 
With two wins over Stanford
guided high schools from Central
California, Stanford's frosh rung up
their thirteenth win of the season
during the week-end preliminaries. |
Friday night Harry Shipkey, '26, oi
Indian football f.ime, brought a Sa
linas High five to the Pavilion which ,
played steady basketball but lost in j
the last few minutes by a field goal,
25-23. Trailing all the way, Fresno
High, directed by Julius Trombetta,
'27, was easily outclassed on the
following night, 32-17.
Friday night Coach Jimmy Brad- |
show was forced lo call out the first
five to stow away the game when
the seconds couldn't hold down
Layer under the bucket and found
forv/aid Pickens too slippery. Stan
ford trailed at half time 12--14.
In the second half the frosh set
! cut to lick the Cowboys and Bcedle,
Quade, and Moore tanked field goals
lin rapid succession. Salinas held on
tc their lead doggedly, however, and
didn't allow the Cards to gain the
upper hand until the final few min
utes when Turner connected with a
; free throw and a long swisher to
make the final and winning points
for Stanford.
Saturday night, the Babes con
trolled the ball most of the game
through better passing and the
Fresno defense presented no stone
wall. After a slow first quarter
which ended in Stanford's favor,
3-2, Turner and Moore bolstered up
the second string and the frosh went
on a scoring spree which gave them
a 21-5 lead at the end of the half.
In the second half Emerzian pro
vided spark to the Fresno club,
tanked five field goals. With the
! final quarter half over the Babes
finally throttled the elusive Fresnan,
rnd Turner, Duncan, Moore, and
Quade quickly sewed up the ball
game.
