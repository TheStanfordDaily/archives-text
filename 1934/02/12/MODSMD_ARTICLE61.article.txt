Physical condition Â»nd Forward j
Jimmy Triolo were the margins that
gave Stanford her second Northern
California Water Polo League
championship when Nort Thorn
ton's Indians defeated the Olympic
Club Saturday, G to 2, in two over- :
time periods of the best and most .
evenly played aq.iaiic contest seen
in the Encina pooh this year.
With the victory, Cardinal mer- j
men ran their string of consecutive !
victories to 13, and they will attempt i
to stretch the list to 15 this after
noon and tomorrow when they clash
with U.C.L.A. in unofficial Coast
Conference games.
Cltib Scores First
The Club took an early lead Sat- ;
urday when George Mitchell scored
from the side. Matching a deter
mined Stanford offense with an i
equally whole-hearted defense, the 1
Winged-0 seven maintained this
score until but a minute before the
end of the first half, when Captain I
Gordy Graves sank * side shot; the j
teams were tied at the intermission. '
Slamming the ball into the net
from a front position early the sec
ond period, Mitchell gave the Club
another lead, which they protected
with superb defense, until but a
few seconds remained in the regu
lar game.
Then Triolo, playing his first full
game since he was ordered out of
the pool with pois;>n oak at the first
of this year, evened Ihe count once
again by slipping a side shot pfist
Elmer Collett, vigilant Club goal
tender.
Two Overtime Periods
Two overtime periods were made
necessary because of the tie, and
Stanford entered the first with an
offensive burst that permitted Tri
olo to score the winning goajl with
a short smash. The score favored
Indian players at the start of the
final extra session. <
In the second overtime period,
with Clubmen showing decided fa
; tigue, Triolo made his third suc
-1 cessful goal assault of the day, and
Paul de Silva slipped two short
. front shots into the cage.
The Stanford frosh also annexed
the Northern California League title
by showing a decided superiority
over the Olympic Club Juniors in
a 7-1 victory. Captain Bob Hoover
led the scoring by diimping in three
: goals. Ben Voss and Pat Pearson
each scored twice. The Club goal
was a hard mid-court shot by Webb.
Game Starts at 4:15
This afternoon's Card-Bruin en
gagement will start at 4:15 o'clock.
The Uclans, already claiming a vic
tory over U.S.C., boast a strong
team, and they guarantee to press

Thornton's squad to tl\e limit. The
outcome of the series today and to
morrow will have a bearing on the
Pacific Coast Intercollegiate title,
since Stanford is not attending the
Minor sports carnival, which in past j
years has settled such matters.
The Bruin offensive threat is Cap- ,
tain Austin Menzies, all-Coast for
word; the southern defense will
center around Billy O'Connor, star
guard, and Gordon Files, goalie.
Although Stanford has never lost
a water polo engagement to U.C.
L.A., the Westwood students appear
confident of their chances this year, j
The Bruins will travel to Berkeley
for a game Wednesday; Stanford!
ineeu California in two weeks.
