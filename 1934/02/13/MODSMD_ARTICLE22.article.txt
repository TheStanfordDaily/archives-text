# GUERARD TALKS TONIGHT ABOUT FRENCH CRISIS
## Noted Authority Will Give Analysis of Last Minute Press Reports 
### Will Williams 
Speaking with a background
which includes both European and
American training, Stanford's Doctor
Albert Guerard, professor of Eng
lish: General Literature, will give
what amounts to an impromptu
speech on the current crisis in
French affairs at 7:30 o'clock in the
Assembly Hall.
In order to keep his remarks as
timely as possible, Dr. Guerard
will check over the press reports
within an hour of the time he is
to talk. He will attempt to give
an informal examination of the re
cent developments and an analy
sis of last-minute news flashes
from Paris.
His subject is a vitally important
one, since it is very possible that the
political developments will have a
direct bearing upon the course taken
by neighboring nations. For these
reasons, Dr. Guerard's remarks
should bo of great interest.
His viewpoint is that of a native
Frenchman, tempered and broad
ened by having lived many years in
America. A keen student of French
affairs, known as the leading Amer
ican authority on this subject, Dr.
Guerard has published nine books
and over 500 magazine articles.
Ilis attitude is international and
comparative, one which fits him
especially as a commentator on
such matters. He gives a course at
Stanford in French Civilization.
The material of his talk will in
clude the strikes, riots, and political
bickerings which have filled news
paper columns during the last few
days. The precise significance of
these events he will attempt to de
termine, and there will be some in
spection of the occurrences leading
up to the recent outbreak. What lies
in store for the future will be dis
cussed, as well as the possible estab
lishment of a military dictatorship
or fascist system of government.
The last few days in Franee have
been the saddest since the foun
dation of the Third Republic, and
the most exciting. During these
hours of tension, every minute
brings new developments.
It Is for this reason that the ad
dress will be an informal one,
though, of course, supported by a
wide previous knowledge of French
political and economic development,
in which light opinion must, neces
sarily, be formed.
