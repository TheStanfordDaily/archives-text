As long sis Campus Opinioncrs tear cacli other's liair,
Nit* Editor can Jook on and smile in a fatherly fashion.
Hill when Campus Opinion begins climbing in the Editor's
hair, it is only natural thai he sit hack and scratch a hit.
A tempest is raging in the column to the right as to
whether one individual should hold two positions, student
manager and B.A.G. student member. One party maintains
that he should and the other that he should not. That is
nol our problem as Kdilor of the Daily.
Hut what is our problem is the statement that the Daily
Kdilor is B.A.C. member; thus he holds two jobs; therefore
il is OK for the student manager to hold two jobs.
It is only right that the position of the Daily Kdilor and
(lie B.A.C. he explained. The Kdilor is an ex-ollicio mem
ber of the Board of Athletic Control, lie is nol a voting
member. Further, and what is far more important, the
Daily Kdilor is nol selected by the B.A.C. or the Graduate
Manager.
The Kdilor, not being chosen by the Graduate Manager
of the 8.A.C., owes that otlieer no allegiance, has no obliga
tions to reciprocate to that otlieer. 11 is true that the Kdilor
holds two positions; lie holds three--ex-otlicio member of
the Kx Committee; in fact, he holds four member of the
Publications Council as well.
But what is important and what Mr. Klopstock, Campus
Opinioner, neglected to note, is thai in each case he can
act independently. The Editor does not have to cater to
other groups.
The situation then between the Editor and the 8.A.C,. is,
iu brief: The B.A.C. pays little attention to the Editor and
he reciprocates. There is no tie between them; each is free
to act -the B.A.C. for the B.A.C. interests, and the Daily
for the students.
