# Well-Earned Oblivion

### 
Today, the students have the opportunity to express
their opinion on those things termed card stunts. The
direct question: "Do you favor abolition of cards?" will be
asked. The campus will answer: "Yes" or "No." The pro
cedure is simple.
The student body should attempt to view the matter
sanely. On one hand is tradition: there is a great tendency
to declare whatever has been as the right thing. Thai
should not sway anyone. On the other hand, is the tend
ency to abolish everything* Thai should not swav any
one.
Each student should calmly sit down and ask himself:
"Do 1 favor card-stunts?" Then, after lie promptly an
swers himself, "No, I do not," he should trot to the election
booths and vote for abolition. If he answers in favor ot
card-stunts, lie should sit and think a little longer.
The argument for ending these things is quite clear.
The Bally Committee, which surely would appreciate its
own handiwork belter than anyone else, claims these
sJiinls are not effective. That should be the biggest argu
ment for their obililion. A poor exhibition is worse than
no exhibition at all. Let us abolish card stunts.
Further, they are a nuisance. The half-time period is
excellent for buying peanuts. Then, just think ot the tun
of eating peanuts during the second half. Let us abolish
canl stunts.
The card-stunts, even if you don't like peanuts, have
earned oblivion. Give them their just deserts.
