# Bigger Stanford Family
## 
### 
When the shadows form on the Inner Quad, even the
hardened rough forgets ahout many little irritants and
gets a "funnv" feeling ahout the Farm. That iunny feel
ing is an emotional longing or some such phrase hut big
he-men do not admit such weaknesses.
That feeling, however, often ends when the individual
is no longer around to see the shadows on the Inner Quad.
In short, alumni drift from the Stanford fold. An attempt
to stop that drift is the forthcoming Alumni Conference
to he. held at Stanford.
The students can help. Alumni returning to the Quad
expect to see the same faces running around that used to
run. Hut many of those faces are gone, and those that are
not gone, have double chins and do not run any more.
That will make the alumni feel sad and lonely. The
students should do all possible to make the old-timers feel
that the present Quadsters are .just ahout the same as those
of the by-gone years. That will make them feel good. We
want them to feel good.
The Daily Staff will elect its Kditor for Volume 85 to
day between 1 :(X) o'clock and 2:15 o'clock. Flection will
take place in the Daily (Wire as usual.
