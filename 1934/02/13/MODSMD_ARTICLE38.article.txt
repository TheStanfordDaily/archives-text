### 
Campaign programs of candidates I
for the vice-presidency, executive |
committee, and B.A.C. representa
tive are listed below.
VICE-PRESIDENCY
Stan Anderson:
In accepting the nomination for ,
vice-presic&nt of the A.S.S.U., I
realize the responsibilities of the
position, and will discharge them j
faithfully, if elected.
John Lyman: I'd like to finish out !
the term I've started, as I'm very
much interested in the work.
GRADUATE MEMBER OF
EX COMMITTEE
Tony Franich: Believing it rather i
ridiculous to even attempt to pre- j
sent a definite platform, I can only
say that I shall endeavor to fulfill
all the requirements of the position
and settle all issues that may con
front the committee to the best of j
my judgment and ability, uninflu
enced by color, creed, or brand of
perfume.
Chuck Glack Glasgow could not
be reached for a statement yester
day.
JUNIOR MAN MEMBER OF
EX COMMITTEE
Bob Church; I Ihink the Ex Com
mittee is the vital organ in stu- 1
dent government. It has a duty to i
perform for the University as a ,
whole. It should not be influenced ;
by a group or groups, but should
work for the benefit of the student |
body as a unit.
I favor whatever will assure the :
interests of the greatest number of i
students, remembering that the in
terest of the entire school is the
important thing.
DUCOMMUN PROGRAM
Charles Ducommun: I favor—one,
better co-operation with the Ad
ministration; two, complete cleanup
of managerial selection system;
three, more thorough investigation
of campus honorary societies; four,
investigation of appointment or
election of publication heads; five,
in favor of the idea of the Consti
tution Revision Committee, and
some of the ideas they have been
rumored to favor, though all points
haven't come out yet.
King Harris: There has recently
been raised the question of whether
students are really managing their
own affairs, whether they are suffi
ciently interested in student gov
ernment to care how and by whom
the executive function is exercised.
It seems important tw me that if we
are to declare that we do have self
government, considerable interest
must be shown by the students to
make it anything but a farce. This
interest and concern by the stu
dents is necessarily expressed
through representatievs on the Ex
ecutive Committee, which interest is
conveyed only by one who is inter
ested himself and regards the job
as something more than a political
position. I am running for this po
sition because I am interested in it
and want to take an active part in
the functions of the Ex Committee.
Sam Lee: As a firm believer in
Stanford student government, I
pledge work, co-operation, and an
unbiased interest in student affairs.
JUNIOR WOMAN MEMBER
OF EX COMMITTEE
Betty Ballachey: When notified
last evening, Miss Ballachey de
clined to give her platform.
Jane Hillebrand: As the junior
woman on Ex Committee, I would
try to be a thinking and an acting,
as well as a voting member on all
campus issues, and with an eye to
the special intersets of the women.
WOMAN PROGRAM
Helen Ray: One of the most im
portant obligations of the Executive
Committee is in working toward,
an intelligent and satisfactory ori
entation of the ne\V student. The
Ex Committee has a joint responsi
bility with the Men's and Women's
Councils, for while the latter two
attend to individual adjustment, the
former has power to promote more
social functions on the campus—
more dances, more class gatherings,
more plays in order to increase the

unity and friendliness among all j
Stanford students.
SOPHOMORE MAN MEMBER
OF EX COMMITTEE
Woody Adams: On entering the
racc for sophomore member of the l
Executive Committee I did so with
out any promises to any clique or
group on the campus. I will uphold !
that which I think to be right and !
will listen to any constructive ad- !
vice given me. If elected, my ac- '
tions on the committee will be for j
the betterment of Stanford and, j
above all, for the protection of the
Associated Students of Stanford
University.
Bill Woodard: My platform shall
be: (1) To represent the sophomore
class in a fair, impartial way with
the best interests ol' Stanford at i
heart. (2) To uphold the tradition
of the Honor Code. (3) To promote
the welfare of minor sports. (4) To
stand at all times for the spirit of
the school motto, "Die Luft der |
Freiheit Weht."
B.A.C. REPRESENTATIVE
Joe Fessio: It must be remem
bered (hat any surpluses accruing |
to the B.A.C. come as a result of j
the activity and support of members I
of the student body of Stanford j
University, and therefore I feel that !
in the expenditure of such funds,
the wishes of the students should
be correspondingly regarded. Need
ed economies may be achieved with
out frustrating the desires of the
student body or injuring the activi
ties they regard as necessary.
I feel that my participation in ath
letics and my background and ex
perience in extra-curricular affairs
as well as experience outside of the
University, for example, as assistant
to the Director of Municipal Sports
to the City of Los Angeles, will en
able me to correctly interpret and
represent the wishes of the whole
student body and the undergradu
ate students in particular.
Fessio Athlete
As a matter of information for
those newer students who feel that
I have not participated in athletics,
I should like to say that I played
baseball here for two years, after
which I sustained an elbow injury
while trying out for a Pacific Coast
League team, which injury preclud
ed any further participation in such
sports.
As for the 1.C.A.A.A.A., I'm in
favor of doing all that can reason
ably be done to see the Cardinal
and White colors wave over the
eastern oval this spring.
MEN'S COUNCIL
Gene Brown: If elected to the
Men's Council, I shall, to the fullest
extent of the authority granted me,
endeavor to: (1) Support the Honor
Code and punish all violators there
of; (2) encourage a political unoin
between Hall and Row, making pos
sible a more unified Stanford Uni
versity; (3) uphold the traditional
mottow of the school: "The Winds
of Freedom Blow"; and (4) further
the interests of minor sports.
George Edmonds: The Men's
Council is not a disorganized part of
the student body, rather it is a
part of the students themselves,
merely acting for them. Conse
quently, the honor code as enforced
at Stanford can only be carried out
by the students, and not by any
judicial organization. The Council
hears, tries, and decides on the
cases brought before it, but it is
not an acting police force for the
University—that is up to the stu
dents.
The honor code is a part of the
University now, and should remain
as such. It is being tried at Califor
nia, but is failing; it has been tried
at Stanford, and it works.
We have an outstanding school,
i but an efficient honor code program
I makes it even more outstanding.
Dick Miles: The administration of
1 the honor system during the current
year can be improved in two re-
I spects: (1) greater emphasis placed
i on freshman orientation; (2) rules
for signing of the pledge should be
1 more strictly lived up to; (3) every

Stanford examination should have
the pledge fully wrtiten at the end
of the work to he considered truly
genuine.
Rushton Program
A1 Rushton: Through the years
J our tradition of Honor and "conduct
j becoming a Stanford Gentleman"
I has become an all-prevailing spirit.
It penetrates our classrooms, our
student government, and our lives.
1 It is my purpose to foster and to
maintain this spirit of Honor among
Honorable Men.
Waldo Munday: My platform is:
(1) a more representative Men's
Council; (2) a square deal for all
who appear before Men's Council;
(3) to meet the ideals of student
and self-government and the Honor
Code; (4) to keep ever in mind the
code of a gentleman as typical of
Stanford spirit; (5) a freshman hon
or council to work under and in
conjunction with the Men's Council.
