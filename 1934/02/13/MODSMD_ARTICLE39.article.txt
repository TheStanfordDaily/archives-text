# CAMPUS OPINION
## ARE FRESHMEN POINTERS? 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It was with a great deal of regret
that I read in the Daily on Monday
morning of the withdrawal of Les
Hables from the race lor student
representative of the B.A.C.
I have heard a lot of talk around
the campus about how one man can
not hold down two positions and do
them both justice. I have also heaid
about all the men running for the
position being of about equal ability.
In answer to the first statement I
would like to point out Les Hables'
record in both offices during the
present year. Anybody who actually
looks into his record and does not
just listen to the idle gossip or poli
tical propaganda must admit that lie
has done a very commendable piece
of work.
In taking up the latter stand I may
point out that one outstanding quali
fication in favor of Mr. Hables' re
election Ls being sadly overlooked.
If all the men are of equal ability it
certainly behooves vis to put back
the man who has the experience and
knows the job thoroughly.
It seems to me that the frosh have
shown better judgment in putting up
a candidate than the upper class
men. Maybe we should follow the
road they have pointed out, and
elect men more on merit and less on
politics. —Paul Zaches
P.S.—This probably sounds irre
levant after the withdrawal has al
ready been announced, but I hope it
may aid in some future election.
