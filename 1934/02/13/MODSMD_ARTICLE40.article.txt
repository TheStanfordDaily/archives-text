# DID CAMPUS OPINIONS ERR?

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Two "old grads" who are quite
well remembered for certain cam
pus activities a year or so back
raised the question yesterday, "Can
the present student manager, who is
seeking re-election to the 8.A.C.,
successfully and loyally serve the in
terests of the student body?"
Maybe those gentlemen who so
ardently expressed themselves
through the medium of this column
conveniently neglected to remember
two points:
(1) The present student manager,
who knows and understands the stu
dent needs on the 8.A.C., has been
"on trial" ever since October 1 of
last year, when he first assumed the
dual responsibility.
(2) His record for the past five
months has been one which shows
that he is—if anyone is—eminently
I capable of attending each and every
! Board meeting and maintaining stu
dent interests throughout. In fret,
the A.S.S.U. has been fortunate in
having as its student representative
) on the Board one who so thoroughly
understands the athletic situation
' here at Stanford and knows the his
: tory and background to practically
j every problem that arises.
Let me ask that today, when the
I electorate consider the possibility of
j "writing in" the name of Les Ha
! bles for the job of student represen
j tative on the Board of Athletic Con-

trol, that it remember the fact that
although he has declined the nomi
nation in order to preserve order in
the campus elections, the Stanlird
student body is still out to elect the
best man for the office ■ — whether
that man be Hables or any other in
dividual. Sincerely,
