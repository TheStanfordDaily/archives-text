# EDITOR AND PRESIDENT IN SAME BOAT?
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In considering the job of B.A.C.
student representative today, let's
not confuse the idea of two jobs that
have nothing whatsoever to do with
each other, as many would-be cam
pus politicians have been for the
past week or so.
Let me paint out that both A S.
S.U. President Jerry Trautman and
Daily Editor Abe MellinkofT, also on
I the 8.A.C., could very well be ac
cused of holding down two jobs also.
But what is the harm in doing so if
the jobs can be well handled for the
benefit of the student body con
cerned?
It is not the time taken by the
B.A.C. past that matters, but it is
the experience, ability, and knowl
edge on hand that count. That's
why we feel the incumbent, student
representative on the 8.A.C., should
be retained in office though he did
decline the nomination.
His name won't be on the ballot,
but we can WRITE it in if we want.
We should consider Les Hables the
most capable individual for a seri
ous responsibility and shouldn't let
petty politics blur good judgment.
Sincerely,
Sam Klopstock
