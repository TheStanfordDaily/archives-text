# NO MAN CAN SERVE TWO MASTERS!
## 
### 
i The Editor, Sir:
Comment has been excited by the
| appearance of an ?rticle in Monday's
| paper written by two law grads.
| A mLsapphrension, I believe, has
| arisen out of it. Nobody is objecting
j to a man holding iwo jobs as a g"n
-j eral proposition. The objection taken
i by the two writers in Monday's
paper only goes to holding two jobs
in which the interests are conflicting.
| That the interests of B.A.C. member
j and student manager do conflict was
j clearly shown yesterday.
I believe this to be a well-taken

objection and a very fair one. It was
a natural point to be seen by legal
! minds and should not be clouded by
misapprehension.
The law goes so far as to make it
illegal for an attorney to represent
I conflicting interests. And the prin
i cipal is applicable to laymen who
would seek to hold two jobs that
conflict in interest.
! No man can serve two masters.
