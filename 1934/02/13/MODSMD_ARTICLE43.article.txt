# COONTON AND RADBRET ARE OUTRAGERS!
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
When two seniors, meaning Coon
radt and von Breton, make a de
liberate mock of Stanford Univer
sity's student government it seems
to me that you as a Leader of Stu
dent Opinion should do all in your
power to suppress such vile machi
nations. If such things are allowed
to continue it will mean the under
i mining of our present democratic
system which attempts to elect peo
ple REALLY CAPABLE of exercis
ing the NUMEROUS duties of the
honorable offices to which they are
elected. The action of Coonradt and
von Breton is an outrage.
These two men are obviously not
fit for office. I know that one of
them thinks that maybe Commu
nism is a good idea and the other
one, when Dr. Wilbur made the
pledge night ruling, said some very
nasty things about the administra
tion of what he called "this Repub
lican monastery."
I heartily agree with whoever it
was that had the sandwich man pa

rading around Quad yesterday and I
believe that that expressed the
opinion of sane people of the cam
pus. I can only repeat, "Fhooey on
Coonradt and von Breton," and hope
that their hairbrained campaign is
decisively repudiated at the polls to
day. Emphatically,
Richard S. Dawson
