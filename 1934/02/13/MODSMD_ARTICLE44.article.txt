# WHO WILL VOTE FOR THESE MUGS?

### 
Enough is enough. Too much is
more than sufficient. The gross un
fairness of giving free advertising
to candidates for election is surely
apparent to a law student.
Yet on the supposed pretense of
a comic take-off on the campus po
litical graft, two candidates' names
have been placed on display in the
Stanford Daily.
In addition to a paid classified ad
vertisement for' the comedy pair
nominated for senior class offices
Ihree silly, if a little humorous, ar
ticles were published in yesterday
morning's Daily mocking graft, but
nevertheless getting their names be
fore the students who will vote at
today's election.
Not to criticize the humor of ihe
candidates, for in reality theirs may
be a worthy motive. But why does
the Daily, tinder the editor's orders,
print such trash when there is real
news around the campus left un
touched?
A little might be excusable as an
oversight, but to devote nearly 25
inches (over a full column) to ac
tual candidates for office is a farce.
It is worse than a farce. It is rank
injustice to the other candidates who

with equally desirable qualities get
no unfair publicity, and seek none.
