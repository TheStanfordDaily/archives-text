desultory student of the game.)

INTRODUCTORY
Rugby football s one of the older
of our athletic games, being only a
few centuries behind the ancient
Olympic sports in matter of age, and
.slightly before bean shooting at bald
heads. It was popular in merrie
England and probably picked up
considerable prestige at Oxford and
Cambridge, where it shared athletic
honors with crew and tippling.
It was spread about the civilized
and barbaric parts of the world by
His Majesty's navy and military, so
that nowadays it turns up at .such
places as the Malay States, New Zea
land, the Argentine, and Stanford.
It is extremely popular in Japan,
where crowds of 75,000 or so are no
novelty.
Believed to have been piayed first
on this Coast in 1889 in Vancouver
by members of British crews, it
achieved at rabid following in that
neck of the woods. They tell me in
the old days someone would organize
a team in Vancouver, and the team
would row a boat for a week to some
farmer's hamlet across the sound,
play rugby on a stubblefield with an
inflated pig bladder and no referee,
absorb a few gills of Scotch encour
agement and row all the way back
home the following week. And the
moderns insist on complaining about
a Monday morning hangover!
With such magnificient traditions,
it's small wonder that anyone who
makes a close connection with the
game either by playing, watching, or
working for it, never severs the at
tachment. Sportsmanship and fair
play are essentials more here than
in any other games, and it is always
considered more desirable to lose a
game like a gentleman, than to win
it like a cad.
Surely, not all men in the rugby
racket are saints (and this is true of
all humanity), but if the proportion
of good scouts is not higher, then
the code followed is certainly more
stringent, and thereby is the differ
ence.
Casting about for a method by
which to treat the subject, it strikes
me that we ought to take up (a)
scaring, (b) the players, forwards
and backs, (c) the scrum and the
lineout, (d) general tactics, (e) ref
ereeing, if we get around to it, (1)
anything else that may turn up dur
ing the melee.
So after thus preparing the read
er's mind with a gentle sedative, to
morrow the subject of scoring and
possibly the players will appear in
Ihe limelight. And as an after
thought, the patient might tomorrow
begin clipping these articles, for if
of any value whatsoever, they ought
to be particularly handy when the
British Columbia team comes here in
a couple of weeks.

INTRODUCTORY
Rugby football s one of the older
of our athletic games, being only a
few centuries behind the ancient
Olympic sports in matter of age, and
.slightly before bean shooting at bald
heads. It was popular in merrie
England and probably picked up
considerable prestige at Oxford and
Cambridge, where it shared athletic
honors with crew and tippling.
It was spread about the civilized
and barbaric parts of the world by
His Majesty's navy and military, so
that nowadays it turns up at .such
places as the Malay States, New Zea
land, the Argentine, and Stanford.
It is extremely popular in Japan,
where crowds of 75,000 or so are no
novelty.
Believed to have been piayed first
on this Coast in 1889 in Vancouver
by members of British crews, it
achieved at rabid following in that
neck of the woods. They tell me in
the old days someone would organize
a team in Vancouver, and the team
would row a boat for a week to some
farmer's hamlet across the sound,
play rugby on a stubblefield with an
inflated pig bladder and no referee,
absorb a few gills of Scotch encour
agement and row all the way back
home the following week. And the
moderns insist on complaining about
a Monday morning hangover!
With such magnificient traditions,
it's small wonder that anyone who
makes a close connection with the
game either by playing, watching, or
working for it, never severs the at
tachment. Sportsmanship and fair
play are essentials more here than
in any other games, and it is always
considered more desirable to lose a
game like a gentleman, than to win
it like a cad.
Surely, not all men in the rugby
racket are saints (and this is true of
all humanity), but if the proportion
of good scouts is not higher, then
the code followed is certainly more
stringent, and thereby is the differ
ence.
Casting about for a method by
which to treat the subject, it strikes
me that we ought to take up (a)
scaring, (b) the players, forwards
and backs, (c) the scrum and the
lineout, (d) general tactics, (e) ref
ereeing, if we get around to it, (1)
anything else that may turn up dur
ing the melee.
So after thus preparing the read
er's mind with a gentle sedative, to
morrow the subject of scoring and
possibly the players will appear in
Ihe limelight. And as an after
thought, the patient might tomorrow
