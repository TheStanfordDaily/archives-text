Seven personal feuds constituting
one water polo game between Stan
ford and U.C.L.A. varsity teams
ended in the Encina pools yesterday
afternoon with Coach Nort Thorn
ton's Indians claiming a 2-1 victory,
their fourteenth straight.
The game was one of the roughest
played in the Stanford pool for sev
eral years; three Cardinal players
and four Bruins were disqualified
because of wilful fouls.
The game was lied until late in the
last half. With both lineups reduced
to six men, a second U.C.L.A. player
was "thrown out," and Captain
Gordy Graves of Stanford succeeded
in slipping the ball past Files, ex
pert Bruin goalie. -
The passing and shooting game
was ineffective on the part of both
squads. Each team showed good de
fense, and comparatively few goal
tries were allowed.
Jim Triolo showed good form in
the forward position, and Graves
played his usual consistent game as
Stanford guard.
Stanford scored first on a tip shot
from Tiiolo to Jim Benet. The
Bruins deadlocked the game a few
minutes later as Captain and all-
Coast Forward Menzies .-mashed the
ball in from directly in front of the
goal. The first half ended in a dead
lock.
The two teams will clash again
this afternoon at 4:15 o'clock, to com

Thornton said, will have rome bear
ing on the Coast Conference cham
pionship.
