# CARD FROSH MEET PIEDMONT HIGH FIVE IN PAVILION TONIGHT
## Touted Highlanders to Give Babes Hot Session 
### 
In what will probably be one of
the mostly hotly contested contests
lhe frosh have entered in the past i
three weeks, Stanford's yeaning
basketball team will tangle with the
Piedmont High varsity at 7:30 o'clock
in the Pavilion tonight.
The Highlanders have a reputation
with Card basketball fans of pro
ducing high-class quintets, having !
sent to the Farm Harold Edelen and
Emil Cowing of the varsity and
Howell Turner of the Babes.
No Size Advantage
While the Indian • Papooses can
claim a considerable advantage in |
comparative scores, the Piedmont
five will not be at the size disadvan
tage other prep fives have played
under when meeting the frosh, for 1
the high school quintet lacks little
in height and weight, are usecf to
roughing it up.
Main cog in the visitors' offense
will be a lanky pivot man, Lyon,
one of the leading scorers in the
Alameda County prep league. An
other Piedmonter sure to give Brad
shaw's defense a busy evening is an
experienced and aggressive forward,
Gregory, while Lerch at one guard
post plays a smooth floor game.
Two Changes Loom
Two likely changes loom in the
frosh lineup, the replacing of Dale
Beedle by Laßue Smith at center
and Allen Duncan for Bill Quade at
the left forward post. Both Smith
and Duncan showed up well in prep
games last week-end. Smith uses l
his height well under the bucket and
plays a smooth passing game, while
Duncan has lost of fire and makes
good on his shots from the court.
Tonight's starting lineups: Stan
-1 ford frosh—Turner and Quade or
Duncan, forwards; Beedle or Smith,
, center; Moore and Sehott, guards*,
Piedmont High—Slaehle and Greg
ory, forwards; Lyon, center; Lerch
1 and Eriehson, guards.
