## 
### M. Jack Newman 
When the results of a week's qual
ifying in the annual novice golf
tournament were tabulated, course
officials found Warren Munro out
distanced the field with a snappy 80
over the par 71 course. Freshman
took the second place with an 82.
The third position was tied up be
tween Jim Ferrie, former varsity
track man who is winding up his
Stanford career with a bid at the
golf team, Miller Freeman, and Irv
ing Sloto. They were bunched three
strokes behind Reynolds.
Munro's 80 makes him the favorite,
but with the men in the field upsets :
are extremenly possible. Reynolds
carries • plenty of dynamite in his
club head. Outstanding of the men
tied in the third berth is Sloto, who
has had a little more experience
than any of the rest of the entrants.

L.A. While there he played a splen
did game.
The trophy put up for the match
has been donated by Coach Twiggs.
