# ENCINA COMMONS BOARDER REFUNDS TO BE PAID SOON
## 
### Russell Ulrich, Jr 
Refunds to students who boarded
at Encina Commons last quarter will
be made Thursday and Friday of
this week at the Encina dormitoiy
office, according to an announcement
made yesterday by E. S. Erwin, as
sistant comptroller.
Totalling $4,000, the refunds are
approximately 12 per cent of the
$33,000 board bill for 'the fall quar
ter, which is a slight decrease from
last year's 14 per cent, accountable
to rising costs of food.
$10 Refund for Some
Students who paid the full amount,
$85 plus tax, will receive $10 re
fund: for the $70 lunch-and-dinner
board books the return is about $8.
As they did last year, holders of $14
books will share, following the new
"hard times" precedent.
Students who have already re
ceived refunds on last quarter's
board for sickness or other absence
will get a deduction from this refund
of 12 per cent of whatever they got
before, in accordance with the gen
eral rate.
Special Time Set
Erwin stressed the fact that re
funds will be available only between
J and 9 o'clock, at the office of En
cina dormitory. This is four hours
overtime, and in addition to this
there will be extra student help at
work to assure that none are turned
away.
Those who fail to come at the
proper hour, on Thursday or Friday,
will not get their money. Freshmen
and members of El Cuadro, Los Ar
cos, El Tigre, and El Capitan are
warned. No receipts are necessary
â€”only an appearance at the proper
time.
