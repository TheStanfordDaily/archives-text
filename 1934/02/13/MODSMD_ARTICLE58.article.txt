# Two Card Debates To Be Given Today
## Debates Scheduled For 4 O'clock; Women Meet St. Mary's 
### 
Stanford debaters function in two
talkfests today, to which students
and the public are invited. The first
takes place at 4 o'clock in Room 201
in which an affirmative Stanford
team composed of David Mellinkoff
and William Kuzell meet negative
debaters from the Northwest Naza
rene College of Nampa, Idaho. The
Nazarene team is well-rated and is
out to avenge a defeat suffered two
years ago by an invading Stanford
team made up of Abe Mellinkoff and
Howard Conn.
The question debated will be the
official Pi Kappa Delta one: "Re
solved: That the powers of the
President should he substantially
increased as a settled policy."
Immediately following the Stan
ford-Nazarene debate, a Stanford
negative women's team will meet a
men's team from St. Mary's in a re
turn non-decision encounter on the
question, "Resolved: That the politi
cal salvation of the world lies in de
mocracy rather than dictatorship."
Stanford women will be able to
demonstrate their prowess in out
talking the male, for the two Univer
sity representatives have had much
experience. Frances Strong has two
varsity debates to her credit, and
Miriam Wolfe has three, all against
men's teams.
Stanford women have estab
lished themselves as competent to
hold their own with the best men's
debate teams in the Bay district.
Coach Lee Chapin requires all
varsity debaters to be present at 4
o'clock.
