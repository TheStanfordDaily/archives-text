# Six Down

Walla Walla penitentiary joined
world trend, left dead and dying
well strewn about. Five convicts are
where they never will need to try
escape again, one guard will never
again try stopping escapes. Nearly
20 convicts attacked turnkeys with
knives, presumably taken from the
prison shops.
