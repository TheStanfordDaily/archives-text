ruled out on fouls, leaving the losers
decidedly crippled. Dick Thorup
was high A.K.L. scorer with four
field goals to his credit.
Flying fists, body blocks, and a
general scramble on every part of
the floor signified that El Capitan
intramural basketball five played
and defeated the Chi Psi hoop play
ers last night 25 to 8.
Tricky Captain Forwards Leslie
Weeks and John Rode led their
teammates offensively, making 11
points between them, with Elton
Gebhardt adding six points to the
total. The winning five were a
smooth clicking combination except
when tangled up on the floor, befud
dling Chi Psi guards by quick, ac
curate passing and close-in shooting.
The club marks up their third vic
tory with last night's game, defeat
ing El Toro in a close game last
week, and S.A.E. by a wide margin
earlier in the season.
Campo Wins

points for El Campo to help defeat
Sequoia 11, 29 to 18. Tally spent
much of the playing time on the
floor, hut recovered equilibrium
often enough to toss in three field
goals and as many free shots. Sammy
Lee and Willard Hinkley ran a close
second for high scoring, making
eight points each.
Lee was particularly efficient un
der the basket, Hinkley making his
shots from far out. Ted Lerch made
the remaining four winning points.
Eugene Jung was responsible for 10
of the Sequoia points.

a mad scramble which ended with
two men going out of the game, and
the Alpha Sigs on the long end of a
26 to 16 score. Jasper Blair and Don
Diedrich scored seven points each,
und Roland Gray made six points
for the winners.
A vastly improved A.K.L. aggre
gation fouled excessively but made
a fair showing, regardless of the
score. Charles Wallace was the out
standing player on the floor, but was
ruled out on fouls, leaving the losers
decidedly crippled. Dick Thorup
