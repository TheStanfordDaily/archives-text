IF I WERE FREE (RKO)
SIX OF A KINO (Paramount)
At the Stanford Theatre
"If I Were Free" makes the usual
Hollywood mistake of allowing a fine j
cast to be wasted on a play which is, j
to say the least, sadly lacking in l
appeal. Irene Dunne and Clive <
Brook, the principals, are given lit
tle chance to display the ait of which ,
they are capable, but the one or two
opportunities offered are eagerly ac
cepted and used to full advantage.
The story revolves around the at
tempts of two people, both unhappily
married, to rid themselves of pre
vious marriage ties and find happi
ness with each other. The result is j
r. play that goes nowhere fast, made I
bearable to the average theatre-goer
only bj r Miss Dunne's undoubted i
charm and Clive Brook's quiet hu
mor.
Completing the double bill is a
play somewhat like ihe first in that
the cast offers tremendous possibili
ties for humor but somehow never
realizes the full potentialities offered
by George Burns and Grade Allen, j
W. C. Fields and Alison Skipworth,
Mary Boland and Charlie Buggies. !
"Six of a Kind" starts out well but I
drags so much toward the end that !
when a really funny situation is pre
sented one can hardly rouse from
his lethargy sufficiently to enjoy it.
A trip across continent by motor,'

undertaken by Ruggles, Boland, j
Burns, and Allen and finally ending !
at a hotel kept by Skipv/orth and
Fields, forms the background of ihe |
play and a setting for the few hu- j
horous situations, which are so |
drawn out that the initial hearty i
laugh is soon subdued into morcse- 1
ness.
It would seem that Hollywood is
sadly in need of a tew good writers
when two fine casts such as these >
are wasted on utterly puerile vc- j
hides. —Honan

I'M NO ANGEL (Paramount)
At the Varsity Theatre
People who are not already too
tired of all the Mae West quotations
which, through no fault of Mae's,
have become sickeningly common
cliches, will have one or both of two
reactions to this film: (a) it is good
entertainment, (b) it is not as good
as "She Done Him Wrong."
As a matter of fact, it is a very en
tertaining affair, with the start in
fine fettle throughout, though she is
deprived of her right to sing, except
in certain furtive moments when she
sings very well.
The plot is, of course, highly insig
nificant and preposterous, particu
larly the courtroom scene. The com
edy is less spontaneous than in the
earlier film, but still amusing, and
the dialogue is exceptionally good.
