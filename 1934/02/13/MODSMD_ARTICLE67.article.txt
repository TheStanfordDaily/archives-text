"We must rid ourselves of the an
tique, the obsolete, and the unim
portant in our medical courses. The
curriculum must be stripped of all
that is not essential. Our aim must
be to train men how to practice
medicine, rather than to load them
with great masses of information,"
said Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur Mon
day morning in Chicago, speaking
before the Congress of Medical Edu
cation, Licensure and Hospitals, over
which he is presiding.
Among the things he considered in
his survey were Ihe need tor better
development of graduate instruction
in medical schools; the significance
of preventative medicine, and ade
quate study of normal nutrition i>nd
gx - owth; attention to prenatal and
post-natal care of mothers; the re
lationships of dentistry; the nursing
profession, and hospitals to the medi
cal school; and "most significant of
all perhaps the need for dealing with
psychology and aberrations of the
mind from entirely new points of
view."
"The doctor of tomorrow." he con
cluded, "will know the physiology
of the normal human body, will be
alert to changes that may take place,
and will think in terms of keeping
men well and efficient, rather than
in terms of treating a patient during
the progress of disease."
