Charles A. (Aviation's most pow
erful voice) Lindbergh can consider
himself refuted, as government goes
ahead in their plans to give the army
air service mail routes now flown by
CA.M private concerns.
White House talk has ii ihat Lindy
is acting for air lines, while New
York held out for his actions being
entirely independent. Nothing held
against the Colonel, though, as it's
his first verbal emission in six years,
and considered justifiable in most
places.
Army birds start carrying the mail
sacks February 19, with Oakland as
Bay headquarters. As soon as prac
ticable contracts will be let to pri
vate companies to supplement, not
replace, army's capacity.
