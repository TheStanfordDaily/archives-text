# U.S. HAS NEED OF LEADERSHIP, SAYS HISTORIAN
## Robinson Praises Lincoln In Stanford Radio Series Talk CHALLENGES CITIZENS Civil War Days Compared To Present Time 
### Emerson Honan 
America must produce a citizen
body intelligent enough, eager
enough, and brave enough to iind
thinking leaders and foilow them
wherever they lead, in the opinion
of Professor Edgar E. Robinson, who
last night spoke on the Stanford
University Hour over radio station
KFO.
In honor of Abraham Lincoln's
birthday, Professor Robinson de
voted most of his speech to the
"Great Emancipator," drawing a
parallel between the position of the
United Slate of Civil War days and
now.
Lincoln Was Rebel
He pictured Lincoln as a rebel
against the obstinacy, selfishness, and
stupid inertia of the pussyfooted of
his day, yet at the same time an
alert, informed, and honest man who
was able to live above the fog both
in public act and private thinking.
"Lincoln was not typical of his
generation," said Professor Robin
son, "but he was, I think, typicai of
the leaders that have given Ameri
can democracy the virtues that it
has."
American history has shown that
the people have builded the nation
through initiative, resourcefulness,
and impatience of restraint, believes
Professor Robinson, and in this new
day the people need to remember
that they too are building a nation.
Changing Reality
America is a living, ever-changing
reality not to be found in history
books, and only a prepared and pa
triotic citizen body can cope with the
task of shaping ihe country's future
course. Political democracy has been
the rule in the past, but it renu'ns
to be seen whether it can survive the
intricate civilization that has been
built up around us.
Professor Robinson closed his
speech with a challenge to the think
ing men of the nation: "With us rests
the answer to the question: shall the
results of Lincoln's work perish from
the earth?
