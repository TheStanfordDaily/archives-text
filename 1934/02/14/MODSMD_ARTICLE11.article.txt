## 
### 
While preliminary work on the
exotic decorations for the Spring
Frosh Formal got under way in En
cina's front hall yesterday, a steady
stream of leather and gilt bids
poured out of the A.S.S.U. offices in
the Union, left only a meager 25 per
cent of the limited number for last
minute buyers at a late hour last
night.
The lower tiers of the mammoth
velvet lounge to be placed in the
front hall went set in place yester
terday afterjiocti under the diraction
of Milo Tally, iampus interior deco
rator, whose latest accomplishment
was the widely acclaimed setting for
S.S. Toyon Formal. Final touches
on the lounge and the lighting effects
for the small fountain which will
play on the top tier will not be made
until Friday afternoon.
Other arrangements completed ic
cently include a contract for a hat
and coat check system to be oper
ated gratis for dance-goers. Re
freshments will break away from the
usual campus tradition, will be com
posed of raspberry and ginger ale
punch, golden bear cookies, and
peppermint hearts.
