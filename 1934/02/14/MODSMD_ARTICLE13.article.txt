### 
Criticizing "modernity" and "poor
proof reading," Professor D. A.
StaufTer, professor at Princeton,
hurled verbal bombshells recently at
the latest issue of the "Naussau Lit,
Princeton literary publication.
StaufTer also criticized the fact that
only one of the literary articles .sub
mitted was directly concerned with
Princeton, others confining them
selves to generalities and "having
the fault of abstaining from conclu
sions."
