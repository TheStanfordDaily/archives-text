# Commons Deserted As Pledges Eat at Houses
## 
### 
Tonight will be a lean night at the j
Commons when the 275 pledges of j
the fraternities eat dinner at their I
respective houses. Wednesday was j
set as the regular night for pledge j
dinners by the Interfraternity Coun
cil at its meeting last week.
This plan is being worked out in j
order to let the dining hall manage
ment know in advance so as not to |
provide a large excess of food on '
that night. It was originated last
year and worked very successfully.'
