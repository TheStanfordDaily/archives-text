## 
### Charlotte Burridge 
She used to speed a fire chief's car I
around the campus but now she is
; ii dignifed sequel to Miss Anastasia j
Dovlc with the title Director of the i
i
Union unit. Here's how it happened!
Miss Louise Price, a native of
Athens, Ohio, was graduated from j
1 the University of Ohio. During the
war she did camp committee service j
work with sailors at the naval sta
tion and in the community of Gulf-|
( vi 11c, Missouri. For nine years she j
i held the office of secretary of the
national camp committee of the Girl l
Scouts. During this time, incident- |
ally, she camped in all but five of j
the 48 United States. In 1925 she 1
became staff member of the interna- I
jtional camp "Edith Macy" at Briar
Cliff, New York at which delegates
liotn 52 countries met. This capable
woman was later sent to Hawaii to!
j organize the Girl Scout movement !
1 there.

Graduate work first called her to
Stanford where she studied for her
Ph. D. That is when she drove the
former fire chief's car. She then
went to Stevens University for a
piece of educational research on the
interests of college women both in
education and recreation.
In discussing the essentials of edu
cation as related to their practical
use in after-college life, Miss Price
explained the need of some reform
in the present educational system by
which the gap between student work
and actual practice might be bridged.
"We are afflicted at present," she
said, "with professors who teach
theory instead of actual ways and
means of accomplishing things."
There's a lot more behind this new
campus house director than just the
ability to manage dormitories. Re
taining popularity with Union unit
residents is a distinct accomplish
ment in itself.
