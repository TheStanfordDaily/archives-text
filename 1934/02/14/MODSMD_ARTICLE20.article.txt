interest in its politics was shown
last night when the Stanford

61 times, as students asked for
results from the A.S.S.U. and
Daily elections. The individual
totals were: Daily elections
queries 24, A.S.S.U. election
posts 37.
Voices varied Most sweet
was the member of the "800"
who called to find out the re
sult of the race for assistant
cheer leader. The most popular
contest was the 8.A.C.; next the
cheer leader. Tied for third
place were the Men's Council
and vice - president contests.
About 9 o'clock returns came,
callers were satisfied.
