Contacts Established
"I cannot ui'ge too strongly to Ihe
students the advantages of making
the most of University Day to es
tablish contacts which may play
suclt an important part in their
lives," he states. "Students will meet
men and women in positions to help
locate them in business ox* px*ol*es
sions after gi'aduation, and to ac
quaint them with the wide-spi'ead
Stanford alumni family.
"Important ways in which stu
dents caxi play a vital part in the
success of our program this year ax*e
the dinners and dance on Friday,
and the living group open houses on
Saturday. I would like to consider
the whole student body as a Hospi
tality Committee, to aid in giving the
graduates as an enjoyable a slay as
possible. Here is a chance to do
.something real for Stanfoxd."
