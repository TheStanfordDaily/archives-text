# Dr. Guerard Says French Not in Crisis
## "Smiling Dictator" Helps National Situation 
### 
Genial, scholarly Dr. Albert L.
Guerard showed little respect for
the French crisis in his talk before !
a Tuesday evening Assembly Hall j
audience. Indeed, he seemed to be j
quite unimpressed about it all.

Affirmed speaker Guerard: "One j
of the things which has made our j
American 'revolution' successful is
the fact that we have a dictator who j
knows how to smile. The man who
took the reigns of the French gov
ernment in its crisis was Gaston i
Doumergue, known widely for his!
ability to smile. A country which:
chooses a smiling dictator to solve I
its problems is not in such a des- i
perate way, after all."
Outlining briefly the circumstances
of French government. Dr. Guerard
pointed out that the actual head of
the government is, like those of
every other country in Europe, a
figurehead, "lucky enough if he is
not executed," and the actual exec
utive the Prime Minister.
In France, the executive is purely
a branch of the legislative side of j
the government, and the government j
Ls, necessarily, a coalition. The po- ,
litical parties are numerous, greatly j
resembling our churches which di- !
vide and subdivide into countless!
groups with varying nuances of be- j
lief.

France has not suffered greatly
from the depression, except for Pa- i
ris which is a city that depends upon j
luxury. As for difficulty with Ger- j
many, the only case in point is j
Alsace-Lorraine, which was settled
years ago. Dr. Guerard is, therefore,
inclined to be optimistic.
