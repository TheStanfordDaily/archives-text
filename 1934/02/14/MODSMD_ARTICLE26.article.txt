# Radio Class Regulates Tower Clock Accuracy
## 
### 
Student clockwatchers arc to be
relieved of all doubts concerning the
voracity of the big clock by the en
gineering office when present plans
of student engineers arc put into ef
fect.
The tower clock is to be automa-
tically regulated by an oscillator sys
tem now being built by members of
Professor F. E. Terman's radio class,
the oscillator giving the clock all the
accuracy of electric timekeepers by
regulating the large weights con
trolling the clock.
