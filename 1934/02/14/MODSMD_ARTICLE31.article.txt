# AND SO TO SWEET OBLIVION ...

I )l! Alt RlCIIAHI):
While not yd feeling as old as the Walrus, it is never
theless true that the time has come. For over ten quar
ters, with alarming regularity, the Daily has been infested
with some creation from this feeble pen.
If all the stuff were pasted end to end, it would stretch
from this Shack to Milpitas, thence hack to the campus,
three times around the Stadium, and with plenty left over
to pave the Inner Quad. And many will no doubt think
that il were better lying along the road to Milpitas, than
in Ihf Daily volumes. There is, however, a slight differ
ence of opinion on the matter in that I think the Daily is
a til burial ground for the awful tilings.
Yes, in retrospect, and, after, all, what has an ex-Editor
bul retrospect, the Editorship, Dick, is a choice job. Ev
« rvthing you do displeases someone. It is as inevitable as
eight o'clocks and just about that uncomfortable. Every
thing you write is automatically inspired bv personal hate
and moral disintegration. You are no longer an individual;
you are an arch-fiend.
II the International Relations Club notice is misplaced
by some freshman reporter, you are a war dog. II the
Scabbard and Blade notice is misplaced by the same re
porter, you are a ditiy pacifist. 11 you attack the Admin
istration, you are a blackened for not having gone lo U.S.C.
in the first place. If you praise the Administration, you are
knuckling to the powcrs-that-be. In short, at ail times you
are sitting.on a hot stove, unprotected by so much as a
worn pair of corduroys.
That is part of the fun. You will Jie awake at night,
counting and nursing your blisters wondering about it
all. Then, back you go the next day to sit on the stove,
('harming fun, I assure you.
Of course, you will have many less blisters than I ac
cumulated. Your ideas suit the majority on the campus
much better than mine did. That does not mean yours
are right, but it surely aids your physical comfort and
mental peace of mind.
All the world likes someone who agrees with them.
And I am sure, Dick, that the Campus will like you im
mensely. You can get duly excited about sports, having
been a sports editor. I couldn't. The Campus is excited
about sports. You will agree, and be happy, and be loved.
You will learn much about Ihe Campus as Editor, Dick.
1 have even though you would never imagine it to count
the rings under my eyes or the blisters . . . You will learn
that Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur is a really swell person. You
will wish that you knew him well enough lo call him
"Doc"; or maybe even "Ray"—bul you never will.
You will disagree with him at times—maybe, violently.
But he doesn't mind, lie is used lo students disagreeing
with him. But very often, you will find lie is right. That
will be a shock to you, for many students have the idea
that if the President is for it, it must be wrong. Talk to
him.
You can campaign, Dick, for a new sidewalk; and it
you're lucky you will gel it. Anything for peace and con
tentment, feel the sidewalk builders. Then, when you leave
ollice, you can point with pride to the sidewalk. You may
find out they were planning to build it two years before
\on took ollice, but nevertheless point with pride you can.
Don't feel, however, that you are accomplishing nothing
ii you shoot at distant stars. Even though you are star
shooting, you may give someone on the campus an idea.
An idea is a line thing.
Of course, remember that you are Editor for the whole
campus. Resist the onslaughts of cranks who will pack
your ollice with all sorts of plans, campaigns, gripes, and
general uplift schemes. After all, there is nothing you can
do with a crank except listen lo il. So, listen.
While you are listening, listen to an old war-horse
advise you that if attacking you must go, and you prob
ably won't, attack things far away. You can fly into Con
gress, Hoover, or Roosevelt and no one bothers to get an
noyed. You can lear into Hitler, Stalin, or the League ol
Nations and most people won't even bother to read your
stufV. Bul throw little round pebbles at the sacred cows
pasturing on the Farm, and the wolves are at you.
And so, I retire to sweet oblivion, lo my little room on
San Juan Hill, just a stone's throw from the larger rooms
of another retired figure who inusl enjoy his cold stove
even as 1 will mine.
And so to sweet oblivion, leaving the Daily in able and,
what is even more important, in clean hands.
Yours,
Auk

shooting, you may give someone on the campus an idea.
An idea is a line thing.
Of course, remember that you are Editor for the whole
campus. Resist the onslaughts of cranks who will pack
your ollice with all sorts of plans, campaigns, gripes, and
general uplift schemes. After all, there is nothing you can
do with a crank except listen lo il. So, listen.
While you are listening, listen to an old war-horse
advise you that if attacking you must go, and you prob
ably won't, attack things far away. You can fly into Con
gress, Hoover, or Roosevelt and no one bothers to get an
noyed. You can lear into Hitler, Stalin, or the League ol
Nations and most people won't even bother to read your
stufV. Bul throw little round pebbles at the sacred cows
pasturing on the Farm, and the wolves are at you.
And so, I retire to sweet oblivion, lo my little room on
San Juan Hill, just a stone's throw from the larger rooms
of another retired figure who inusl enjoy his cold stove
even as 1 will mine.
And so to sweet oblivion, leaving the Daily in able and,
what is even more important, in clean hands.

While not yd feeling as old as the Walrus, it is never
theless true that the time has come. For over ten quar
ters, with alarming regularity, the Daily has been infested
with some creation from this feeble pen.
If all the stuff were pasted end to end, it would stretch
from this Shack to Milpitas, thence hack to the campus,
three times around the Stadium, and with plenty left over
to pave the Inner Quad. And many will no doubt think
that il were better lying along the road to Milpitas, than
in Ihf Daily volumes. There is, however, a slight differ
ence of opinion on the matter in that I think the Daily is
a til burial ground for the awful tilings.
Yes, in retrospect, and, after, all, what has an ex-Editor
bul retrospect, the Editorship, Dick, is a choice job. Ev
« rvthing you do displeases someone. It is as inevitable as
eight o'clocks and just about that uncomfortable. Every
thing you write is automatically inspired bv personal hate
and moral disintegration. You are no longer an individual;
you are an arch-fiend.
II the International Relations Club notice is misplaced
by some freshman reporter, you are a war dog. II the
Scabbard and Blade notice is misplaced by the same re
porter, you are a ditiy pacifist. 11 you attack the Admin
istration, you are a blackened for not having gone lo U.S.C.
in the first place. If you praise the Administration, you are
knuckling to the powcrs-that-be. In short, at ail times you
are sitting.on a hot stove, unprotected by so much as a
worn pair of corduroys.
That is part of the fun. You will Jie awake at night,
counting and nursing your blisters wondering about it
all. Then, back you go the next day to sit on the stove,
('harming fun, I assure you.
Of course, you will have many less blisters than I ac
cumulated. Your ideas suit the majority on the campus
much better than mine did. That does not mean yours
are right, but it surely aids your physical comfort and
mental peace of mind.
All the world likes someone who agrees with them.
And I am sure, Dick, that the Campus will like you im
mensely. You can get duly excited about sports, having
been a sports editor. I couldn't. The Campus is excited
about sports. You will agree, and be happy, and be loved.
You will learn much about Ihe Campus as Editor, Dick.
1 have even though you would never imagine it to count
the rings under my eyes or the blisters . . . You will learn
that Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur is a really swell person. You
will wish that you knew him well enough lo call him
"Doc"; or maybe even "Ray"—bul you never will.
You will disagree with him at times—maybe, violently.
But he doesn't mind, lie is used lo students disagreeing
with him. But very often, you will find lie is right. That
will be a shock to you, for many students have the idea
that if the President is for it, it must be wrong. Talk to
him.
You can campaign, Dick, for a new sidewalk; and it
you're lucky you will gel it. Anything for peace and con
tentment, feel the sidewalk builders. Then, when you leave
ollice, you can point with pride to the sidewalk. You may
find out they were planning to build it two years before
\on took ollice, but nevertheless point with pride you can.

been a sports editor. I couldn't. The Campus is excited
about sports. You will agree, and be happy, and be loved.
You will learn much about Ihe Campus as Editor, Dick.
1 have even though you would never imagine it to count
the rings under my eyes or the blisters . . . You will learn
that Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur is a really swell person. You
will wish that you knew him well enough lo call him
"Doc"; or maybe even "Ray"—bul you never will.
You will disagree with him at times—maybe, violently.
But he doesn't mind, lie is used lo students disagreeing
with him. But very often, you will find lie is right. That
will be a shock to you, for many students have the idea
that if the President is for it, it must be wrong. Talk to
him.
You can campaign, Dick, for a new sidewalk; and it
you're lucky you will gel it. Anything for peace and con
tentment, feel the sidewalk builders. Then, when you leave
ollice, you can point with pride to the sidewalk. You may
find out they were planning to build it two years before
\on took ollice, but nevertheless point with pride you can.
Don't feel, however, that you are accomplishing nothing
ii you shoot at distant stars. Even though you are star
shooting, you may give someone on the campus an idea.
An idea is a line thing.
Of course, remember that you are Editor for the whole
campus. Resist the onslaughts of cranks who will pack
your ollice with all sorts of plans, campaigns, gripes, and
general uplift schemes. After all, there is nothing you can
do with a crank except listen lo il. So, listen.
While you are listening, listen to an old war-horse
advise you that if attacking you must go, and you prob
ably won't, attack things far away. You can fly into Con
gress, Hoover, or Roosevelt and no one bothers to get an
noyed. You can lear into Hitler, Stalin, or the League ol
Nations and most people won't even bother to read your
stufV. Bul throw little round pebbles at the sacred cows
pasturing on the Farm, and the wolves are at you.
And so, I retire to sweet oblivion, lo my little room on
San Juan Hill, just a stone's throw from the larger rooms
of another retired figure who inusl enjoy his cold stove
even as 1 will mine.
And so to sweet oblivion, leaving the Daily in able and,
what is even more important, in clean hands.

While not yd feeling as old as the Walrus, it is never
theless true that the time has come. For over ten quar
ters, with alarming regularity, the Daily has been infested
with some creation from this feeble pen.
If all the stuff were pasted end to end, it would stretch
from this Shack to Milpitas, thence hack to the campus,
three times around the Stadium, and with plenty left over
to pave the Inner Quad. And many will no doubt think
that il were better lying along the road to Milpitas, than
in Ihf Daily volumes. There is, however, a slight differ
ence of opinion on the matter in that I think the Daily is
a til burial ground for the awful tilings.
Yes, in retrospect, and, after, all, what has an ex-Editor
bul retrospect, the Editorship, Dick, is a choice job. Ev
« rvthing you do displeases someone. It is as inevitable as
eight o'clocks and just about that uncomfortable. Every
thing you write is automatically inspired bv personal hate
and moral disintegration. You are no longer an individual;
you are an arch-fiend.
II the International Relations Club notice is misplaced
by some freshman reporter, you are a war dog. II the
Scabbard and Blade notice is misplaced by the same re
porter, you are a ditiy pacifist. 11 you attack the Admin
istration, you are a blackened for not having gone lo U.S.C.
in the first place. If you praise the Administration, you are
knuckling to the powcrs-that-be. In short, at ail times you
are sitting.on a hot stove, unprotected by so much as a
worn pair of corduroys.
That is part of the fun. You will Jie awake at night,
counting and nursing your blisters wondering about it
all. Then, back you go the next day to sit on the stove,
('harming fun, I assure you.
Of course, you will have many less blisters than I ac
cumulated. Your ideas suit the majority on the campus
much better than mine did. That does not mean yours
are right, but it surely aids your physical comfort and
mental peace of mind.
All the world likes someone who agrees with them.
And I am sure, Dick, that the Campus will like you im
mensely. You can get duly excited about sports, having
