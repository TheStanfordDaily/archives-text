# Prestige Where?
## 
### 
As the daily whistle blew yesterday on the perpetual
sorority contest, the figures stood with the Hall leading
hv 200 women, the box score reading roughly: liastiles
odd, Pan-Hellenic .'5OO. A prediction is ventured that a year
from today the score will stand at 1500 700, Hall women
being the sole gainers by the increased registration of
women.
Four hundred, symbolic of New York's exclusive smart
set, will at Stanford indicate the number by which "non
orgs" exceed Greeks. Numbers menu strength; the "100"
excess, with all its implications, will then swing the tradi
tional prestige to the Hall; and (so logic would continue)
sororities will lose their importance.
Doubted this may be, for to this superficial world Greek
letters on a doorstep are a sign of eternal prestige. I his
argument alone would be all-convincing, and logic would
come to naught, were il not for the already-occurred de
cline and fall of Gap and Gown's false prestige. Sororities
may well give a thought to their own prestige, present and
future.
