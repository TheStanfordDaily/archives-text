# G.O.P. Hollers

### 
G.O.P. made another play for Con
gressional strength in next election
with political circles not sure of ef
fect, presuming the defeated party
down, but not quite out.
Hyde and Beck, prominent under
Hoover's administration, gave de
nunciatory speeches before a Lincoln
Day dinner of the Natl. Republican
Club.
Especially vitriolic was Hyde who
said the people never had voted for
the New Deal as promulgated by
F.R.'s administration. Declaring it
was only a campaign catchword, he
implied underlying philosophy was
never understood.
"Only one person saw the danger
and was warned," quoth he; "that
was Herbert Hoover, who some day
will be understood and acclaimed."
