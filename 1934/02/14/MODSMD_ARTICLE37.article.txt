OF ACTORS: I—Mr. Walter
liampden
Walter Hampden is one of those
few remaining actors whose legend,
mellowed through a number of years
of uncritical acceptance of it, is still
sufficient to support him.
What powers Hampden may have
had in the past it is impossible for
me to say; but the undeniable fact
remains that in his most recent ap
; pearance hereabout he has proved
' himself not only dull but incompe
-1 tent.
And this is all the more curious
because his Cyrano de Bergerac was
a good, if not brilliant characteriza-
I tion. At that time perhaps the
j shortly previous appearance of Mr.
Richard Bennett in the same role
made anything else seem a miracle
of intelligence and fervor.
It remains, however, that as Ca
| ponsacehi and as Hamlet, Mr. Hamp
| den's playing was thoroughly unsat
: isfactory. He rolled his magnificent
j voice thunderously through the thea
; tre; but his tones, however thrilling
jor lulling in themselves, infre
: quently bore any correspondence to
I his lines themselves. He chopped the
j verses meaninglessly, paused at the
| ends of carry-on lines, and gave the
| ultimate imperssion not. of an actor
[ in a play but of a preacher intoning
| the words of a sermon.
If this were not sufficient, Mr.
j Hampden (who, as actor-manager,
j is responsible for the quality of his
i company) surrounded himself with
j a group of completely inadequate
J persons who read their lines —if pos
j sible—with less understanding than
| the star, and lacked even his good
j voice.
: Apparently aware only of the most
obvious comedy, he ploughs ponder
ously through even "Cyrano" with a
solemnity indicative less of pro
i found awareness of the world's mis
ery than a dull mind. His comic
j scenes bear the stamp of repetition
and possess what comic qualities
they do because of the play itself and
in spite of any aid which Hampden
lends to them.
In short, Hampden is a carry-over
i from the hey-dey of the Road, which
accepted mutely or with meaning
, less ecstacy, anything which gave an

appearance of greatness. In reality,
he is not an actor but an orator,
whose place properly should be a
pulpit in a large and gloomy church.
There his voice could roll out mag
nificiently—and far less annoyingly.
