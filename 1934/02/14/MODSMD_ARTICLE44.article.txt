## "OLD FOX" DEMURS AT RULES CHANGE 
### 
"Pop" Warner is not at all satis
fied with the recent rule book modi
fications adopted by the national
football rules committee. The "Old
Fox" thinks that little or nothing
was done to aid the running game,
which is in a precarious state in these
times.
"The modern game," says Warner,
"is favorable to kicking and passing
at the expense of the running game,
and I think the latter is and should
be, the fundamental thing. We spend
ihost of our practice time on it and
then can't get anywhere in the game
with it.
"The two passing rules help <hat
department, but 1 don't think ihey
will open up the running game. I
would like to see the professional
rule allowing passes from any point
behind the scrimmage line adopted.
In those pro games that I have seen,
the rule seems to work very well.
"The clause allowing one incom
plete pass over the goal line without
calling a touchback is perhaps Ihe
best part of the changes. It takes a
certain load off the quarterback, who
won't be so reluctant to call for a
pass on the first down. At present
the general thing is to run three line
plays and the defense comes up and
plays a nine-man line and then drops
back for the expected pass."
