# OKAY, SAYS TINY THORNHILL
## 
### 
"Tiny" Thornhill, on the other
hand, is pleased that the committee
saw fit to do nothing drastic. "They
evidently plan on being gentle with
the fans by spreading any innova
tions over a period of years. Any
radical changes would only discour
age the layman who has a hard
enough job keeping up with the
rules as it is.
"The new clause which allows the
punter the privilege of having an
other player hold the ball is almost
useless, in my opinion. It is designed
to give a setup for trick plays, but
I know no very effective ones which
might be worked from it."
This issue marks our blockout as
.sports editor of the Stanford Daily;
tomorrow a new and able news
paperman, Frank Tremaine, will be
boss of the ranch. Tremaine will be
connected with the spring sports
.scene from two angles—as commen
tator in the Daily and as a member
of the baseball team.
This sports editor's job is a great
racket, and thoroughly enjoyable,
and we are sorry to be leaving. Two
big highlights occured in our re
gime, notably 13-6 and 7-3. It was
a big thrill to file that victory story
from Los Angeles; and to phone the
Daily press to start rolling with the
story on the Big Game extra.
We tried to be impartial and not
tread on any toes unless a good slap
on the wrist was deserved. If in
advertantly our blunt jibes an
noyed someone, apologies are forth
coming. We hope to continue, with
the new sports editor's permission,
writing rugby for the Daily. That's
a great game, fellers, and some day
we're going to fill the stadium to
watch it. Adios! —Hamilton
