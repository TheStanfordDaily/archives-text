# CARD FROSH BEAT PIEDMONT IN FAST HOOP TILT, 44-27
## 
### 
j A first quarter flurry of swishers
| by a hot guard and a dead-eye for
ward paved the way for Stanford
frosh win over Piedmont High last
night, 44-27, in one of the best exhi
bitions of sharp-shooting the year
lings have played in this season.
The Babes were oft to a flying start
when Laßue Smith and Bill Quade
each tallied two field goals in short
order. The hard-lighting Highland
ers came back strong and in a few
minutes had a 9-8 lead, due mainly
to high-class passing and shooting
by Center Dick Lyon.
Quade, Scliott Star
The rest of the first half was all
Red, with Quade tanking difficult
shots from the side with deadly ac
curacy, and Carl Schott dropping his
no-arch bombers, leaving the Pied
monters momentarily demoralized.
The half ended with the Card year
lings leading 29-13.
The two teams battled on even
terms during the remaining two pe
riods with the Cards' eight field goal
lead scarcely threatened. Moore and
Smith played good ball under the
opposing bucket, and proved a bit
too husky for the prep guards.
During the last few minutes Al
len Duncan and Larry Randall were
put into the frosh lineup, the re
mainder of the game being played
by the first string.
Smith High Point Man
For Stanford, Smith, besides car
rying off high point honors for the j
evening with 12, played a smooth- !
passing game and managed to gain
the tip-off for the frosh during the
first half, enabling the Babes to make
their scores before the Highlanders
got their defense set. Moore played
his usual steady floor game, and
scored consistently under the bucket.
For the visitors Lyon looked ef
fective at center, and made good on
his center court chances, tallying 11
during the evening. Considering the
size disadvantage which they worked i
under, the prep guards, Lerch and :
Erichson, played tight ball during !
the fray. Lerch was the most ac- ;
curate passer the visitors had, while !
Erichson potted a couple from the j
center of the court.

j A first quarter flurry of swishers

ward paved the way for Stanford
frosh win over Piedmont High last
night, 44-27, in one of the best exhi
bitions of sharp-shooting the year
lings have played in this season.
The Babes were oft to a flying start
when Laßue Smith and Bill Quade
each tallied two field goals in short
order. The hard-lighting Highland
ers came back strong and in a few
minutes had a 9-8 lead, due mainly
to high-class passing and shooting
by Center Dick Lyon.
Quade, Scliott Star
The rest of the first half was all
Red, with Quade tanking difficult
shots from the side with deadly ac
curacy, and Carl Schott dropping his
no-arch bombers, leaving the Pied
monters momentarily demoralized.
The half ended with the Card year
lings leading 29-13.
The two teams battled on even
terms during the remaining two pe
riods with the Cards' eight field goal
lead scarcely threatened. Moore and
Smith played good ball under the
opposing bucket, and proved a bit
too husky for the prep guards.
During the last few minutes Al
len Duncan and Larry Randall were
put into the frosh lineup, the re
mainder of the game being played
by the first string.
Smith High Point Man
For Stanford, Smith, besides car
rying off high point honors for the j
evening with 12, played a smooth- !
passing game and managed to gain
the tip-off for the frosh during the
first half, enabling the Babes to make
their scores before the Highlanders
got their defense set. Moore played
his usual steady floor game, and
scored consistently under the bucket.
For the visitors Lyon looked ef
fective at center, and made good on
his center court chances, tallying 11
during the evening. Considering the
size disadvantage which they worked i
under, the prep guards, Lerch and :
Erichson, played tight ball during !
the fray. Lerch was the most ac- ;
curate passer the visitors had, while !
Erichson potted a couple from the j
center of the court.
