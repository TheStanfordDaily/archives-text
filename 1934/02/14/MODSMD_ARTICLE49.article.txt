# POLO IN POINT FOR WILDCATS
## 
### 
Back from a highly successful in
vasion of Oregon, Stanford's cham
pionship - bound poloists continue
preparations this week for the highly
important series with the University
of Arizona here on Thursday and
Saturday, February 22 and 24.
Conceded an even chance to upset
the highly-touted Wildcat polo team,
Captain Gordan's riders are anxious
to repeat and better their single tri
umph of last Thanksgiving. At that
time the Indians journeyed down to
Tuscon and won the first game from
the Arizonans, only to drop the sec
ond.
Since last fall. Bob Fullerton and
Russell Rasmussen, two freshmen
from Culver Military Academy, have
moved into the starting lineup by
virtue of a new conference eligibil
ity rule. Their presence rounds out
a quartet which Captain Gordan con
siders the best he has ever coached
at Stanford.

"Caesar" became an official title
of all Roman emperors following the
reign of Augustus Caesar.
