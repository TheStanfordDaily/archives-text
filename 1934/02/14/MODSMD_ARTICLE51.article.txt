# WATER POLO TEAM COMES FROM BEHIND TO OUT-ROUGH BRUINS IN SECOND GAME
## 
### 
Stanford's water polo team is not
existing entirely on past reputation.
That fact was proved to the satis
faction of a .cocky U.C.L.A. varsity
as the Indians won the second game
of a two-game series from the Bruins
yesterday afternoon in the Encina
pool, 3 to 2.
Stanford won the first game Mon
day, 2 to 1, and strung their list of
consecutive victories out to 15 by ;
Tuesday's victory.
Bruins reputedly came to Stan
ford with the notion of proving Stan
ford's aquatic supremacy was more
reputation than merit. And the!
Uclans came close enough to back- j
ing up this assertion to cause Coach
Nort Thornton two games full of i
anxious moments.
U.C.L.A. led at the half time, 2 to !
1, but Stanford tallied two quick
goals in the second period to main
tain a lead wjhich they protected j
with a good defense until the linal J
gun.
Tuesday's game was a continua
tion of Monday's feud, and fouls and
rough tactics were as frequent.
In the first half Stanford played a
mediocre game; team work was j
poor, and the defense twice opened
up fatally. After Bob Foster had
given Stanford a" lead within the first
few seconds of play by slamming the
ball into the cage from close to the
center of the pool, Paxton of the
Bruins took advantage of a laxity in
Indian guarding to even the count.
Sellers, visiting sprint, found an
other opening, and scored again for
the southerners.
The Card teamwork was much
better in the second period, and a i
good offensive served as an admira
ble defense. Cardinal thrusts at ihe i
goal, however, wei'e erratic, and
Stanford missed many easy chances.
After vollying the ball with Vlad
Taranik, Jirn Triolo succeeded in
slipping the ball into the cage from !
the side to tie the score. Taranik, ]
from in front of the goal, scored I

] again a few sefconds later to give the
! Indians their margin of victory.
The goal-tending of Files, Biuin
j ace, staved off many prospective
points. Leo Cook came through with
a consistent, cool game in the Card
i cage.
The guarding of Stanford Captain
Gordy Graves completely bottled up
j the Uclan scoring threat, Menzies.

Nort Thornton two games full of i
anxious moments.
U.C.L.A. led at the half time, 2 to !
1, but Stanford tallied two quick
goals in the second period to main
tain a lead wjhich they protected j
with a good defense until the linal J
gun.
Tuesday's game was a continua
tion of Monday's feud, and fouls and
rough tactics were as frequent.
In the first half Stanford played a
mediocre game; team work was j
poor, and the defense twice opened
up fatally. After Bob Foster had
given Stanford a" lead within the first
few seconds of play by slamming the
ball into the cage from close to the
center of the pool, Paxton of the
Bruins took advantage of a laxity in
Indian guarding to even the count.
Sellers, visiting sprint, found an
other opening, and scored again for
the southerners.
The Card teamwork was much
better in the second period, and a i
good offensive served as an admira
ble defense. Cardinal thrusts at ihe i
goal, however, wei'e erratic, and
Stanford missed many easy chances.
After vollying the ball with Vlad
Taranik, Jirn Triolo succeeded in
slipping the ball into the cage from !
the side to tie the score. Taranik, ]
from in front of the goal, scored I

] again a few sefconds later to give the
! Indians their margin of victory.
The goal-tending of Files, Biuin
j ace, staved off many prospective
points. Leo Cook came through with
a consistent, cool game in the Card
i cage.
The guarding of Stanford Captain
Gordy Graves completely bottled up
j the Uclan scoring threat, Menzies.
Stanford's water polo team is not
existing entirely on past reputation.
That fact was proved to the satis
faction of a .cocky U.C.L.A. varsity
as the Indians won the second game
of a two-game series from the Bruins
yesterday afternoon in the Encina
pool, 3 to 2.
Stanford won the first game Mon
day, 2 to 1, and strung their list of
consecutive victories out to 15 by ;
Tuesday's victory.
Bruins reputedly came to Stan
ford with the notion of proving Stan
ford's aquatic supremacy was more
reputation than merit. And the!
Uclans came close enough to back- j
ing up this assertion to cause Coach
Nort Thornton two games full of i
anxious moments.
