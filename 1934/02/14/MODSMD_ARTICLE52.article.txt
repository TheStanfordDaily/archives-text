## 
### 
Ernie Nevers and his frosh basc
ballers yesterday outscored the
! Menlo J.C. nine, 2 to 1. Lanny Da
i vis, squat yearling pitcher, showed
a nice change of pace and excep
j tional control, allowing a scant two
| hits and fanning 13 Menloitcs.
In the first inning A1 Brent singled
and scored when Dale Beedle poled
one into right field. The frosh scor
ing ended in the-third when Bill
Macdonald, second sacker, singled,
took second when Catcher Tsouts
ouvas walked, and romped in on an
infield hit, Beedle's second bingle.
The J.C. tallied in the second
frame on a single, a passed ball, and
| an error.
