# JOE CRONIN JOINS KENEALY TEAM TO PLAY CARD NINE
## 
### 
After suffering two set-backs in!
as many starts this season the var- i
sity baseball team takes the field I
today with but slight chance of j
scoring a win when it faces a tal- !
ented aggregation of major and ,
Coast league stars representing the I
Kenealy Seals on the Sunken dia- ]
mond at 2:15 o'clock.
Led by Joe Cronin, young man- j
ager of last season's world champion j
Washington Senators who will play \
shortstop, the visitors will take the ;
field with a lineup that would give j
any opposition a tough afternoon.
Pre-Conference Game
Although Coach Wolter would
like to see his boys win, he will fol- |
low his usual practice of using the
pre-conference games as testing lab
oratories for promising candidates !
keeping an eye on the fast approach
ing championship race.
Three new and comparatively un- |
tried men will open Ihe game in the)
outfield this afternoon. Jack Beach, j
a hustling fly chaser, will start in j
center. He will be flanked by Jim
Neuman in left and "Monk" Mos
crip in right. All three of these)
named have shown plenty of ability |
so far this season.
I
Seals Stellar
In addition to Cronin the Seals I
will have Art Garibaldi, Joe Ward,
Jerry Donovan, "Count" Puccinelli, I
Ralph Burger, and Giesberger. Gari
baldi and Donovan are mainstays on
the San Francisco Seals. Puccinelli
and Berger played for Boston in the
National league last season, and Joe
Ward, former U.S.C. star, per
formed for the Angels in the Coast
league during the 1933 race. Gies
berger was formerly the property
of the Missions and was sold at a
fancy price a few seasons ago to the ;
Boston Red Sox.
I
Wolter will start the following j
men: Tremaine at third, Forsythe at I
short, Woolley at second, Grayson or :
Hearn at first, Anderson on the :
mound, and Massey behind the plate, !
Neuman, Beach, and Moscrip will
be in the outfield. '
