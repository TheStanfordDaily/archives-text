# CARD HOOPSTERS POINT FOR SECOND S.C. SERIES
## 
### 
With Keith Topping back with the
squad, Stanford's varsity cagers are
pointing toward their second series
of games Friday and Saturday with
S.C. The two games will be the first
appearance of the Trojans on the
Stanford campus this year.
Gordy Ma 11 at r a 11, first-string
guard, is still in the hospital and
definitely out of the Trojan, series.
Mallatratt, laid up with a bad cold,
was unable to perform against U.C.
L.A. last week.
Out of the championship race
themselves, Stanford's Indians are
still in a good spot to wreck the title
aspirations of others. Although Cal
ifornia leads the race, S.C. still has
hopes of pulling into the lead, hopes
which rest entirely upon whether
Ihey can get by Coach Bunn's men
successfully this week.
Although Topping was working
out he is forced to wear a mask to
protect injured nose in an accident
last week. The versatile Keith, grid
dor and boxer as well as basket -
bailer, is the ace of the Card attack
and if he is hot this week-end, the
Trojans are apt to find the memora
ble defeat down South repeated.

The remainder of the Card regu
lars, including Captain Hal Edelen,
Arnie Anderson, and Chuck Rogers,
are all in the enviable condition that
made it possible for them to knock
i off the Uclans twice last week-end.
Edelen, smooth-passing and one of
the Coast's finest defensive centers,
made possible the Card's fine show
ing against U.C.L.A., while the play
j of Anderson as well as Gorter and
[ Cowing, aided Rogers and Edelen in
1 stopping Don Piper and his team
| mates. Â«
