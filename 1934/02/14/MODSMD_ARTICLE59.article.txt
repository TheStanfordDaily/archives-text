# U.C. BOXING MEET TO BE TOMORROW
## 
### 
Results of 13 fights between Stan
ford's boxing team and California
leather-pushers at the California
Gym tomorrow night at 8 o'clock will
be important in determining this
year's boxing supremacy between
the rival schools. Equally important
will be a return match to be held
here at Stanford in two or three
weeks.
Coach Schall sends his 13 wild In
dians into the fray night
in the jinx position of top-dog, given
them because of the large number
of returning veterans in their ranks.
They are: bantamweight, A1 Ve
larde; featherweight, Cabby Cabal
lero; lightweights, Bob Grander and
Ralph Purdy; welterweights, Waldo
Munday and either Randy Hill or
Ben Cave; junior middleweights,
Colin McCorriston and Tom Morrow;
middleweight, Clarence deVeuve;
light heavy, John Fowler and heavy
weight, Wes Muller. All but two of
the first named for each weight are
Stanford University champions.
