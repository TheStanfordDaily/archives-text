# Air Mail Smoke
## 
### 
Air companies began to fire their
big guns yesterday in last effort to
halt annulment of air mail contracts.
Transcontinental & Western Air,
Inc., attempted to get injunction
against annulment but best it could
do was order from Federal Judge
J. C. Knox calling Postmaster Far
ley and J. J. Kiely, New York post
master, to show cause why they
should not be restrained from an
nuling TWA contract.
Government took steps to combat
order while Senate went into closed
executive session to consider air mail
contempt cases. J. V. Martin, air
craft manufacturer, charged before
House military affairs committee
that manufacturers made a secret
agreement in regard to bids on gov
ernment contracts whereby 75 cents
out of every dollar spent on army
and navy aircraft went for graft.
Senator McCarra urged investiga
tion of TWA's $250,000 gift to Lind
bergh,

Meanwhile, government took steps
to take over air mail service. First
announcement was that present air
mail pilots who hold reserve officers'
commissions in army may volunteer
to aid army in flying mail.
