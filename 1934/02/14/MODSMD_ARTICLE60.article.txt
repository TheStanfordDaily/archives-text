# COACHES FAVOR RULES REFORMS
## 
### 
According to a poll of Northern
California coaches and officials re
vealed yesterday, the football rules
committee went just far enough in
the recent changes, (1) giving the
offense an extra incompleted pass
over the goal line without losing
possession of the ball, (2) allowing
one offensive back to hold the ball
while another punts in, and (3)
abolition of the five-yard penalty
! for two incomplete passes in a se
ries of downs.
The first is expected to loosen up
the watertight "nine-man line" goal
line defenses that have recently de
veloped, by keeping the backs in po
sition to defend against pas-ses on
| all downs, knowing that the offense
will not fear to pass on any down if
they can keep the ball anyway. The
second will put an element of de
ception into quick kicking. The third
is expected to speed up the game
i and ease the burden of the officials.
