Dean J. Hugh Jackson of the
Graduate School of Business will
I give advice to prospective business
students in the regular Wednesday
i evening lecture, a discussion on ma
nor departments and schools at 7:15
i o'clock tonight in the Little Theatre.
Tonight's lecture will primarily be
|of interest to juniors and seniors
j who are thinking of taking up a
business career, states Dean Jack
! son. It will also be helpful, however,
to lower division students who are
interested in having suggestions as
i to what subjects to study while in
| the undergraduate status.
Equal to Harvard
"The Stanford School of Business
iis fully equal to the one at Har
vard," Jackson maintains; and Dean
Jackson has taught at Harvard as
well as at Stanford. He further ex
| plained that Stanford has no trouble
at all in finding jobs for students
! who receive degrees from the school.
"Considerably more than one-half
of the business students had jobs by
i graduation day," he said, "and all of
them are now located in positions,"
: he added.
Finance Popular
j. The largest number probably go
into some field of finance, with the
next most popular field being the
| distribution end, Jackson reports.
I Four out of the seven professors
| in the Stanford School have been on
i the faculty at Harvard, and one other
has .been offered a position at Har
j vard.
Dean Jackson has been at Stanford
j since 1926 as professor of Account -
: ing in the Graduate School of Busi
l ness, and has been dean of the
School since 1931. Born in lowa, he
received his A.B. degree at Simpson
College, Indianola, la., in 1912 and
an LL.D. in 1930. He has had 10
' years' experience as a certified pub
j lie accountant, but considers the
professorial life of "preparing young
i people for the battle" more inter-
I esting.
Experiences Interesting
In 1920 he was granted an M.B.A.
i degree from Harvard. Beginning his
teaching work as instructor of book
! keeping in high schooLs in lowa and
I Missouri, he acted on the faculty at
! various times from 1916 to 1927 at
j the University of Oregon, Harvard
Graduate School of Business, Uni
versity of Minnesota, New York
; University, University of Chicago,
' and Northwestern University,
j He has had many interesting ex
periences in the business world, es
pecially on Wall Street, where he
contacted some of the most impor-
I tant business men in the country.
He says that he finds his experiences
make interesting class illustrations,
i and urges that anyone teaching a
subject should have some funda
mental experience in that line.
Golf, motoring, and hunting are his
favorite hobbies.
