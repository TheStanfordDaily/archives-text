the United States and of the world.
Representing 40 states, Washing
ton, D.C., and 18 territories and for

I their education at the University
| founded in memory of Leland Stan-
I ford, Jr.
I California, of course, leads all other
I states by a large majority in number
i attending Stanford, with 2.469 for

j gon, which has 98.
Utah is in fourth place wilh 47,
Idaho fifth with 44, and Arizona next
