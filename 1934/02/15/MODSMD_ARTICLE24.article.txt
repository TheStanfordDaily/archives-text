## Dean Jackson Tells History, Requisites of School 
### 
Stanford students, business-mind
ed, crowded the Little Theatre last
night at Dean J. Hugh Jackson's
discussion of the Graduate School
! of Business.
• Requirements, expense, history, j
I and a comparison of the local in- ■
stitution with that of Harvard com- |
prised the major portion of the lec- j
ture discussion. Experience on the j
faculty of both universities, togeth- |
er with other leading educational i
i institutions, has equipped Jackson !
j with an unusually complete back- j
ground.
Size Lauded
Individual instruction, caused by j
i the comparatively small enroll- j
ment, is the major advantage of the j
i school, he believes. Harvard, on the I
i other hand, although offering vir- j
tually the same facilities, lacks this !
i feature.
Requirements he declared to be
negligible. The economics major is
i not the only possible preparation
for the school, engineering and psy-
I chology being of equal value.
Courses in logic, accounting, and
, similar subjects arc strongly ad
. vised.
Questions from the audience fol
lowing his discussion brought out
the fact that tuition in the school,
while exceeding that of the lower
division student, is much less than
! the Harvard fee.
Quotes Successes
Stressing the value of the busi
ness training afforded, Jackson
quoted instances of students who
obtained lucrative positions through j
; the course.
A comparison of Harvard and j
Stanford revealed that they have j
many features in common; size is j
; the principal difference. "If you j
haven't been out of California, go to j
Harvard," he advised, adding that I
