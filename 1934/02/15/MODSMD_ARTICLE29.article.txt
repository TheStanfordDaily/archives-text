# Polls Busy Tuesday in Heavy Vote
## Record of 1,100 Surpasses Last Year by 350 
### 
The Stanford body politic swarmed j
to the polls this year in unprcce- j
dented numbers. More than 1,100 '
campus voters cast ballots for their i
favorites compared with last win- i
ter's turnout of 750 which was con- j
sidered an average student vote.
This sudden awakening out of the j
lethargy that has for long gripped j
Stanford politics is ascribed by ex- !
perts to the heated wave of caucus !
activity which swept the campus last j
week.
Lesser experts say it was Coon- :
radt and von Breton.
The introduction of the preferen- j
tial system of balloting was designed j
to eliminate the necessity of revotes.
The need for this reform was plainly
indicated by the returns of the first
day's voting last year when only four
out of the 17 offices were filled.
The other 13 offices were decided
upon in a revote held a week later.
Interest in this revote was even
fotblor ih.ii'j iii the fii.->t bulhu east
ing, only a bare 650 students evinc
ing enough interest in the outcome io
go to the polls.
Last year's amendments fared well.
All four managed to get through the
first day's balloting successfully and
were practically the only part of the
ballot that was not held over for a
revote. The most important amend
ment of last year's ticket was the
adoption of the preferential system.
