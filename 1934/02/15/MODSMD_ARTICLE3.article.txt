# Ship Mail Changes
## 
### 
Forecasting complete reorganiza
tion of ship mail subsidies, F.R. re
vealed that many ocean mail con
tracts were given to wrong sources.
Gradual change rather than imme
diate cancellation was predicted. At
least S.F. contracts would be af
fected; local shipping men display
keen interest in subsidy changes,
though declining to comment.
Idea is to speed service by letting
bigger, faster companies carry for
eign mail. Also to centralize out
going posts around New York rather
than scatter them. It is probable
that little companies may still have
pay (subsidies in F.R.'s opinion) al
though their work will be lessened,
or become nil.
