# EX COMMITTEE RETAINS LETTS AS NEW EDITOR
## Lack of 6-Vote Majority Makes Tuesday Ruling Unconstitutional STROUSE VOTE VOID Publication of Volume 85 Beginning Today 
### 
Constitutional provision that ac
tions of the Publications Council can
be repealed only by six Ex Commit
tee votes made Bob Letts editor of
the Daily for Volume 85, it was
determined at a special meeting of
the Committee lust night.
The fact came to light after the
Ex Committee's 4 to 5 vote of Tues
day night to repeal the Publications
Council's selection of Letts had been
interpreted as a victory for Dick
Strouse, the other candidate.
Since Daily staff election stood 2G
to 19 votes for Strouse, the issue
went to the Council as the margin
was not a two-thirds majority. Letts
was the favorite of the publications
group, the vote being four to two.
The Ex Committee meeting was
the first one to include the newlv
elected members of the body and
was specially called by President
Jerry Trautman to settle the tan
gled D;.ily editorship.
Besides having held the positions
of night editor and associate edi
tor on the Daily, Letts has had
practical experience in newspaper
work. He has been sports editor of
the Palo Alto Times, Olympic
Games correspondent for a Japa
nese news service, and has worked
on various Peninsula papers.
Today's '»<» of the Daily i.- 'h'
initial effort of the newly appointed
staff and the editor for Volume 85.
Contrary to the custom of former
years the newly appointed staff
members have stepped into their
positions immediately on announce
[ ment of their promotion while
I ink is yet wet on the proclamal
