Volume <Xf> of the Stanford Daily gets under way this
morning with a vow to give its readers complete, aeeurate
courage of all campus events.
| he editor can truthfully say that he is thrilled and
pleased with the opportunity to do his part in the forward
ing of Stanford, and hopes that he can reflect the confi
dence placed in him.
As oltieial news organ of the Associated Students, the
Daily is interested in performing its functions. The Daily
is supported by students, and in a spirit of fairness and
mutual benefit realizes that it owes at least a willing co
operation to worth-while campus activities. Simultane
ously, however, it reserves the privilege and cherished
l ight of wholesome criticism, vital to the healthy existence
of any institution.
An innovation in the paper's makeup will be a news
comment column, written by Oompton Hangs, which will
deal with the why's and how's of world affairs. In intro
ducing this new feature, it is in line with the fundamcn
of the University education. Mr. Hangs has had a
professional background in the fields which his col
li nm will touch.
