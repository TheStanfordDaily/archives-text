Stanford lias one sport about which comparatively
little is known, in "which there is little student interest.
That sport is polo. Yet, despite this apathy and lacking
funds which the Ii.A.C. was able to supply until a year
ago. Captain (Jordan and 11 is team have carried on.
Even more than that, they have achieved a name for
themselves, and, what is of more interest to the campus
;it larga, for the I'niversity. The Stanford polo squad is
uited among the best on tlie Pacific ('.oast.
The games with I'niversilv of Arizona a week from
tomorrow and Saturday will be a playoff of the unollicial
coast intercollegiate polo championship. Stanford, with
the best squad in years, is favored to win.
Arizona students support their polo clam, and probably
some of them will come the 1000 miles to Stanford with it.
Potential championship ability deserves enthusiastic
student support. Captain (Jordan's men have won Stan
ford a place in the polo sun. Thev collect their due the
thanks of the campus. To them also should go their re
ward student interest in and support of polo.
