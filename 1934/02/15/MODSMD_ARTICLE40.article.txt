Editorial whips rest today with the announcement that
there will he no meeting of the general staff until Monday
afternoon. However, the entire Editorial Hoard and de
partment heads, including sports, news, and I'nited Press,
will gather 'round the Daily hearth at 1:1.1 o'clock today.
A new volume, new ideas, new plans . . . new people.
And woe betide him who fails to avail himself of the above
tidings, in order that it shall not be necessary to have more
new people.
