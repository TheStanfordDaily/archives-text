"HIPS, HIPS, HOORAY" (R.K.0.)
At the Stanford Theatre
Wheeler and Woolsey (plus Doro
thy Lee) cavort, sing cute songs, nnd
try to be funny in a typical Wheeler
and Woolsey (plus Dorothy Lee) ve
hicle. This one has to do with the
mistaken abduction of bonds, a cos
metic company, and a surprisingly
hilarious (if slightly slap-stick)
transcontinental auto race. The con
testants become involved in a cy
clone, a blizzard, and a balloon infla
tion. An adagio dance (taking place
in a luxurious investment office) de
velops Into a really high type of bur
lesque. In conclusion: if you like
Woolsey's cigars and eccentric dress,
if you think "Dot" and 'Bert" are
"cute," this comedy will please you,
and after all that's Hollywood's driv
ing ambition (the profit-seeking mo
tive eliminated).
"The Search for Beauty"
This is a problem picture. It at
tempts to expose the racket of so
called health magazines who increase
circulation by an appeal to the sex
side of the American pocketbook.
Their method is to employ prominent
athletes as dummy editors, and pub
lish "hot" stories under their names.
In the cast are Buster Crabbe, the
winners of an Anglo-Saxon health
and beauty contest, and numerous
Olympic stars. The picture manages
to do what the magazines it exposes
attempt to do. That is, it is nothing
more than an excuse for the exposi
tion of the "body-beautil'ul." Of
course, there are some pretty nice
nudes, so if you're the kind of per
son who likes French post-cards—
the acting, direction, dialogue, con
tinuity, or what-have-you-to-make
v.p-a-picture? are to be commended
for their complete absence.
