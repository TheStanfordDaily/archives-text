# BEN WORKS OUT
## 
### 
"Blazin' Ben" Eastman, holder of
the world's marks in the quarter and
half mile, is working out daily with
the Stanford track team, although he
graduated last June, in order to get
back in shape for competition this
spring, after an injury forced him to
take last season easy. His ultimate
goal is a place in the 1936 Olympics'
880-meter title race.
