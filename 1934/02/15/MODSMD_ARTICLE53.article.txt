## NEW FEET IN OLD SHOES MAY BE LOOSE 
### 
Stepping into the shoes of an old
master makes us feel rather squeam
ish. The record made by our pre
decessor, Spud Hamilton, in hand
ling this page is one to shoot for, but
we're going to try for it anyway and
try to make our feet fit the old shoes,
even if they do slip around a bit at
first.
Spud said yesterday in his fare
well In this column that "This sports
editor's job is a great racket and
thoroughly enjoyable," so we are
looking forward to a pleasurable
term.
Two big highlights occurred dur
ing the last regime, grid victories
over U.S.C. and California, but we're
looking forward to more than two
highlights.
