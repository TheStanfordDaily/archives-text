# SPRING SPORTS WIDELY VARIED
## 
### 
A widely varied menu of spring
sports is now brewing with Coaches
Templeton, Wolter, Maloney, et al
wielding the ladles. According to all
reports, another bunch of champions
are going through their paces out at
Angell Field. With returning strength
concentrated in a few events, namely
the weights, pole vault, and hurdles,
if a few of the newcomers can live
up to expectations, perhaps the Tro
jans and Bears are in for another
licking.
Over at the Sunken diamond,
Harry Wolter has what he termed
"the best team in years." Plenty of
veteran strength is found here also
with most of it concentrated in the
outfield and the battery.
Famous for its tennis stars, Stan
ford may have some more in the
making. Some have already gained
national recognition and the court
game will probably draw much at
tention from the athletically in
clined inhabitants of the Farm.
