The varsity baseball team lived up
to its potentialities yesterday for the
I first time this season, thereby de
i feating the potent Kenealy Seals 6

Behind the fine mound work of Stan

hits, the Cards.played steady defen
sive baseball erring only three times.
Stanford started strong by count
ing two runs in the first inning, es
tablishing a lead which was held '
throughout the game. Frank Tre
maine opened the initial inning with
an infield hit. After stealing second ,
he was advanced to third on a i
dribbling grounder down the third ;
base line hit by "Monk" Moscrip. |
Tremaine crossed the rubber when |
Garibaldi, playing second base, |
dropped Beech's high pop fiy behind
the first sack. On the same play |
Moscrip was picked off of second for j
the first out of the inning. Woolley, {
hitting clean up, then forced Beach
at second and scored when Gari
baldi booted Neuman's grounder.
Three More
In the third the Cards scored three
more runs to set a substantial lead.
Two walks, a hit, and two errors ac
counted for the three tallies.
The visitors were held scoi-eless
until the seventh frame when two
runs were chalked up as Anderson
weakened slightly to allow two hits
and a walk. Berger, the first man up,
was safe when Tremaine threw wild ;
to first base on his grounder. Gari
baldi singled advancing Berger to
second. Both vent to second and
third, respectively, when Tremaine
again tossed inaccurately to the ini
tial sack. Joe Cronin then flew out
to Miles in short center field after
which O'Keefe cleaned the bags with
a sharp single to left. Choline closed
the inning when he drove a liner into
Forsythe's hands at short, the latter
doubling Lepeyri off the second sack.
