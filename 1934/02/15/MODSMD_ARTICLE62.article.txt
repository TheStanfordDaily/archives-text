# INDIAN QUINTET TO MEET U.S.C.
## 
### 
Determined to prove that their re
ccnt victory over S.C. was no acci
dent, the Stanford Indian quintet
will meet the Trojans tomorrow and
Saturday nights in the first Stanford
appearance of Coach Sam Barry and
his charges this season.
"Leaping Lee" Guttero, "Barking" !
Joe Kelly, Julie Bescos and all the
rest of the Trojans' cohorts will be
cut to revenge the rude slapping
clown which Coach Bunn's men ad- {
ministered some three weeks ago.
With Keith Topping working out '
with the squad and rapidly getting i
back into form, Stanford chances
seem quite good to repeat the Los j
Angeles victory. The principal weak- |
ness of the team will be caused by ,
the absence of Gordy Mallatratt,
scrappy, accurate-shooting guard.
Both Al Page and Robin Lindsey, i
however, showed up well in the ]
U.C.L.A. series and will probably fill
in capably against S.C. An added i
advantage for Stanford is the ex- i
ceptionally good showing of Wytze
Gorter at forward against the Bruins.
If Gorter can repeat against the Tro
jans, the Indians will have a scoring
threat that they lacked in the last
series.
