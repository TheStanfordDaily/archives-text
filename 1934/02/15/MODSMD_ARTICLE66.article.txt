# University of Texas Profits from Oil Fields
## 
### 
No trouble with finances has the
University of Texas. The famous
Big Lake oil fields, one of the largest
groups of producing deep oil wells
known to the oil industry, are situ
ated on land owned by the Univer
sity.
Even further financial benefits are
expected by the University through
the recent stabilization of the oil in
dustry, effected by Secretary Harold
Ickes, Federal oil administrator.
