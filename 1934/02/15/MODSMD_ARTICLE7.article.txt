### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 14 (UP).—
President Roosevelt today ordered
I George H. Earle, Minister to Aus
tria, to proceed to Vienna without
delay in view of the grave politi
cal situation in that country.

VIENNA, Thursday, Feb. 15 (UP).
' —The government massed loyalist
; forces early today for a smashing
attack before dawn on Socialist
strongholds in Vienna in an offen
sive designed to overwhelm the
rebel army and rid the nation of
Socialism as a militant force.
The government high command
concentrated picked troops and
Heimwehr units preparatory to
storming the Reichbridge over the
Danube. The objective on this sa
) lient is a large municipal building
five stories high.
Volunteers Fire
The concentration was cai'ried out
! quietly while other units including
nondescript volunteers in civilian
! clothes, kept up a running machine
I gun fire on the city's outskirts, di
j verting the enemy's attention.
Lieutenant - Colonel Engelbert
j Mausch was designated to command
I the attack. He led 40 men in one
of the bloodiest surprise attacks on
a Socialist barricade last night and
is one of the government's most
daring soldiers.
The jaded government troopers
1 awaited the "zero hour" with little
interest. The men, wearied by in
i cessant fighting and on duty since
, last Monday, were prepared des
perately to make an end of the
revolt or die in the attempt.
Loyalists Determined
The loyalists pinned their hopes
j of victory against the rebellion on
1 the success of the dawn attack.
They determined to end the revolt
' as the fighting went into the fourth
day of horror.
Casualties remained uncertain,
but generally were estimated at be
tween 1,000 and 1,500 dead and
j thousands wounded here and over
the countryside, where fighting con
-1 tinued in numerous sdctors, notably
at Linz, capital of upper Austria,
75 miles northwest of Vienna on the
, Danube.
Non-Combatants Shot
Women and children were among
the casualties, official reports
j showed. Two children were listed
among the dead, and between 20 aijd
25 women. The women joined their
men in the rebel ranks, standing
shoulder to shoulder with them in
the thick of the battle.
Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss
meanwhile hoped for a peaceful end
to the civil warfare, possibly Thurs
day. He made a passionate appeal
over the radio to the nation last
night to support his government and
offered pardons to all who sur
-1 rendered by noon today. Few took
advantage of his offer. The fighting
' continued.
