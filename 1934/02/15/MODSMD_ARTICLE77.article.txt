# Experts Blame Forest Fire for L.A. Flood
## 
### 
The direct cause of the disastrous j
New Year's flood in Los Angeles was j
laid to the destruction of chaparral j
and other vegetable growths by a j
forest fire last November. >
This decision was reached by ex- ;
perts of the Forestry Service, Soil j
Erosion Service, and Geological Sur- i
vey after an examination of condi- 1
Hons in nearby canyons undamaged !
by the fire where the precipitation I
was the same. No flood conditions j
existed in these canyons.

Professors' offices at the Univer
sity of Illinois are equipped with
shower baths.
