# CLUB DEBATES POSSIBILITY OF MANCHUKO WAR
## Eastern Chinese Railway Called Key to Peace By Fisher 
### 
Pacifist fears of war between Rus
sia and Japan over Manchuko, dy
namite key of the Far East, are
groundless if last nighi's Walrus
Club discussion, held in the Women's
Clubhouse, is to be taken as a cri
terion. Russia has little provocation
to armed conflict, while Japan will
probably settle the issue within her
own boundaries, according to C. F.
Penrose of the Food..Research Insti
tute and H. H. Fisher of the History
Department, featured speakers of
Jhe evening.

Penrose Paper

Fisher outlined the railroad situ
ation in Manchuko, emphasizing that
the Chinese Eastern Railway is the
most.important factor in the argu
ment. Although economically un
profitable, the railroad forms a bone
of contention between the two pow
ers. It is hardly an issue of war for
the two countries as Russia will
probably lose it in any event, said
Mr. Fisher, but it remains as a con
stant irritant.

Penrose, unable to be present, sent
a paper to be read which reviewed
the international situation in Japan.
The present Japanese policy is a
direct result of the depression, ag
gravated by Japan's return to the
gold standard. Economic deficiencies
enabled the militarist faction to
strike well, aided as it was by uni
versal discontent among the people.
Premier Shidehara, leader of the
pacifist faction, was assassinated
some time ago, as were other promi
nent men who might have been in
fluential in maintaining a peaceful
foreign policy. These murders, said
to be instigated by the ministers of
war and navy who are not responsi
ble to the Cabinet in Japan, have
been upheld by the people's atti
tude, a not too favorable plan.
Democracy has not failed in Japan,
according to Penrose, it has never
been established. The policy of the
nations should be to ease the present
restrictions on Japanese immigration
and a lowering of the protective tar
iffs in order to allow a market for
Japanese goods. The Manchuko re
gime is a distinct menace to peace
ful relations, and should never be
recognized as an independent state.
Nations of the world should rec
ognize signs of trouble in the situa
tion and take steps to correct them
before they reach such magnitude
that an explosion occurs, in Pen
rose's opinion. The situation is dan
gerous and factors keep piling which
will eventually result in war if they
are not promptly corrected.

groundless if last nighi's Walrus
Club discussion, held in the Women's
Clubhouse, is to be taken as a cri
terion. Russia has little provocation
to armed conflict, while Japan will
probably settle the issue within her
own boundaries, according to C. F.
Penrose of the Food..Research Insti
tute and H. H. Fisher of the History
Department, featured speakers of
Jhe evening.

Penrose Paper

Fisher outlined the railroad situ
ation in Manchuko, emphasizing that
the Chinese Eastern Railway is the
most.important factor in the argu
ment. Although economically un
profitable, the railroad forms a bone
of contention between the two pow
ers. It is hardly an issue of war for
the two countries as Russia will
probably lose it in any event, said
Mr. Fisher, but it remains as a con
stant irritant.

Penrose, unable to be present, sent
a paper to be read which reviewed
the international situation in Japan.
The present Japanese policy is a
direct result of the depression, ag
gravated by Japan's return to the
gold standard. Economic deficiencies
enabled the militarist faction to
strike well, aided as it was by uni
versal discontent among the people.
Premier Shidehara, leader of the
pacifist faction, was assassinated
some time ago, as were other promi
nent men who might have been in
fluential in maintaining a peaceful
foreign policy. These murders, said
to be instigated by the ministers of
war and navy who are not responsi
ble to the Cabinet in Japan, have
been upheld by the people's atti
tude, a not too favorable plan.
Democracy has not failed in Japan,
according to Penrose, it has never
been established. The policy of the
nations should be to ease the present
restrictions on Japanese immigration
and a lowering of the protective tar
iffs in order to allow a market for
Japanese goods. The Manchuko re
gime is a distinct menace to peace
ful relations, and should never be
recognized as an independent state.
Nations of the world should rec
ognize signs of trouble in the situa
tion and take steps to correct them
before they reach such magnitude
that an explosion occurs, in Pen
rose's opinion. The situation is dan
gerous and factors keep piling which
will eventually result in war if they
are not promptly corrected.
Pacifist fears of war between Rus
sia and Japan over Manchuko, dy
namite key of the Far East, are
groundless if last nighi's Walrus
Club discussion, held in the Women's
Clubhouse, is to be taken as a cri
