NEW YORK, Feb. 15 (UP).â€”Wal
ter F. Brown, Postmaster-General
under the Hoover administration,
today rebuked the Roosevelt ad
ministration for accusations that
airmail contracts were awarded
through collusion.
Brown issued a statement which
he described as "the facts about the
meetings of airmail and air passen
ger operators" held at the postof
fice department during his regime.
"There is absolutely no justifica
tion," his statement said, "for the
charge that any of the airmail con
tracts were awarded through col
lusion among contractors, or by any
other illegal practice."
The 3000 - word statement con
cluded:
'"No suggestion of dividing air
mail operations among the compa
nies represented at the meetings
was ever made or contemplated....
The only air mail operations of ma
jor importance were awarded under
the provisions of the law relating
to competitive bidding to the lowest
bidder."
