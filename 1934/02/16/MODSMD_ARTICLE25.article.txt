# General War in Future Improbable, Says Lutz
## 
### RUSSELL PAINE 
A serious war in Europe is not
probable. This is the view of Ralph
Haswell Lutz, professor >f History,
and dean of Graduate Study, who is
uii authority on Austrian and Ger
man politics.
With the present uprising in Aus
tria precipitated by the Socialists in
the Vienna region against the Doll
fuss government, another general
European war is not; beyond concep
tion, and has in fact been hinted in
various news dispatches.
"I hope a general war is impos
sible,"' said Lutz who, however, went
on to say that "anything might hap
pen over there." If Germany were to
intervene at the present time, or if
the powers guaranteeing Austrian
independence were to step in, a Eu
ropean war might result, he ex
plained.
The Austrian Socialists, who Lutz
thinks have no connection with the
Russian bolshevists, have long been
a thorn in the Dollfuss government
and violently opposed to a union un

der the Hitler government.
Present information obtained in
this country has not definitely estab
lished the exact source of Austrian
trouble, Lutz says. It is probably
either a planned uprising to establish
a Socialist state and prevent Fascist
government, a demonstration against
Austrian militarism, or else a pro
gram of the Dollfuss government
which is using the uprising as a hy
pothetical excuse, he explained.
There is little chance of the So
cialists getting anywhere in Austria,
Lutz believes, for they have been
practically driven out of Iheir strong
hold in Vienna, and th? Austrian
army is heavily armed.
A German-Austrian .dliance or
Anschluss is inevitable and will be
a good tiling, Lutz believes. It may
be delayed by the prohibitionists of
the European powers for a time, tut
despite the fact that ihe Dollfuss
government is pledged against the
Anschluss, European trends point
that way.
