VIENNA, Friday, Feb. 16 (U.IV)
Firing in Vienna broke out again
at midnight, after government
forces had declared the civil war
fare ended at noon Thursday.
VIENNA, Feb. 15 (U.P.)â€”Guns
were silenced and Socialism crashed
tonight in the war-torn Austrian
Republic.
Loyalist forces, in a series of
smashing attacks, emerged victori
ous. The rebel armies, disorganized
and disspiiited, were in retreat.
Thousands surrendered, taking ad
vantage of the government's offer of
amnesty.
Dollfuss Strong
Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss, dic
tatorial head of the semi-Fascist re
gime, retained power. He was hailed
by thousands of wearied but jubilant
followers as the "man of '.he hour'"
to save Austria's independence from
the menace of Nazi Germany.
Austria, under his freshly consoli
dated leadership, moved toward a
Fascist rule along Italian rather than
Nazi German lines.
Steel-helmoled Loyalists, includ
ing men in the Fascist-like Heini
wehr, moved through the battle-torn
Vienna streets, "mopping up" after
four days of warfare, which took
possibly 1.500 lives, including many
women and children.
Apartments Iluined
Many sections of the capital were
a shell-shattered shambles. Once
beautiful modernistic apartment
buildings were in ruins. They were
occupied by Socialists and their fam
ilies, and used as fortresses during
the brief civil war.
The Socialists admitted defeat as
they laid down their arms. The man
in the street after a week of horror
and the pounding of big guns, ad
mitted it was "almost over." The
Fascists, exhuberant in victory, de
clared: "It's all over but the hang
ings."
Quit for Amnesty
Chancellor Dollfuss' nation-wide
offer of amnesty started !oward the
end. Ills deadline for submission
was noon. The rank and file of So
cialists silently, grimly threw down
their rifles and deserted their barri
caded apartments in Vienna, .sur
rendering to the Loyalists. They ex
pected and, in the main, were given
amnesty, although men marked as
Socialist leaders were exempted from
the pardons. Most of these fled.
Spurts of firing occurred during
the day en a few sectors, but United
Press staff men touring the city and
environs at failed to find a sif?n
of the lighting. The barricades were
deserted. Approximately 2,000 So
cialists are under arrest .m Vienna
awaiting court martial trials. Doll
fuss may be expected to extend am
nesty io many.
