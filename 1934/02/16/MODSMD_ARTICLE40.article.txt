The Ddilt/ C.alifoinian's Walter Winchcll department
has uncovered a bit of scandal which must have proved in
teresting to the boys across the bay.
With great alarm it ([notes the Stanford Handbook,
[jointing to the "traditional belief that Stanford teams are
better, etc." The columnist lauds the choice of the word
"belief," observes that the lill a I phrase of the passage, "At
California entirely different views are held," is a "brilliant'
observation."
Then follows a harangue on ranchos, 10-minute radio!
"hours," and "primitive aborigines populating the farm." j
Curiously, the Handbook speaks of beliefs, and admits
the possibility of other views. The Californiac deigns to I
present the irrevocable facts.
