gratis, and lots of fun for all who attend, combine to pro-!
duce an evening of enjoyment.
So there are three hours of recreation awaiting the fel-i

around 9 o'clock. Dales aren't required, the women are;
there waiting, and campus males may attend in regular!
rough fashion by just walking in and enjoying themselves.
True Stanford hospitality is a great thing. KspeciallvJ
