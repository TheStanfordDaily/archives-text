Austria—The Heart of Europe
Yesterday brought the news that
Austria's small but determined
Chancellor Dolfuss had crushed the
nation-wide Socialist revolution.
This fact i.s of tremendous signific
ance, for now more than over before,
the peace of Europe rests upon the
fate of little Austria.
The elimination of the Austrian
Socialists does clear up the picture,
but only a little: Dolfuss still has
to deal with a million or so German
Nazis within his country. They have
been sitting on the sidelines waiting
for their chance to seize ;he govern
ment; so have lots of their friends
just across the border in Germany.
Since he came into office nearly a
year ago, Dolfuss and his party have
been squeezed on one side by the
Socialists, on the other by the Nazis.
His way of getting out-of this tight
squeeze was to fight Socialist up
risings with one hand, while build
ing up an Italian brand of Fascism
with the other. Now that the Social
ists have been counted out, Dolfuss
will have to face the German Nazis
(Fascists). Austria's six neighbors
are looking anxiously over the fence,
waiting to see what will happen.
In spite of plenty of outside pres
sure, it looks as though Austria will
go Nazi before long. The chances
are that the country would not be
invaded by German soldiers, but
would team up with Hitler of its own
free will simply because Dolfuss had
nothing to offer. Naturally the men
who engineered this apparent union
between Germany and Austria
would take pains to assure the vlorld
that they would abide by the peace
treaties and would safeguard Aus
tria's independence. But the fact
remains that Austria would be run
from Berlin by Hitler. It is [his
strong possibility that interests Italy
and France.
A considerable part of northern
Italy borders on Austria. For over
ten years Mussolini has been trying
to dominate eastern Europe; now
Hitler wants to do the same. So far
Mussolini has beaten him to the
draw. Now a friendly, independent
Austria is a first class buffer between
Italy and Germany and an ace in the
hole for Mussolini.
France is vitally interested in
keeping Austria free of German en
tanglements because of its nearness
to her allies Jugoslavia and Czech
oslovakia; the latter is sandwiched
in between Austria and Germany,
and only 45 miles from Vienna, scene
of most of the fighting. Czechs are
naturally worried, for some of their
Socialists have gone on strike sym
pathizing with their Austrian friend*.
Besides, it may be necessary for the
Czechs to invade Austria to keep
their frontiers free from fighting and
revolution. A German army is
waiting to invade Austria too if this
happens; so are some Italian soldiers
to the south.
It is the object of England to pre
vent all this if possible, forjt would
mean another European war. This

Ino easy job. Lots of Frenchmen
want England, Italy, and France to
invade Austria themselves and put a
stop to all this monkey-business.
Nearly everybody realizes that this
would only make things much worse.
So England in its traditional part of
peacemaker has sent its young, able
Capt. Eden to Paris, Berlin, and
Rome to negotiate a conference be
tween all the interested nations. In
the meantime, all eyes are on Aus
tria and Chancellor Dollfuss.

Mussolini has beaten him to the
draw. Now a friendly, independent
Austria is a first class buffer between
Italy and Germany and an ace in the
hole for Mussolini.
France is vitally interested in
keeping Austria free of German en
tanglements because of its nearness
to her allies Jugoslavia and Czech
oslovakia; the latter is sandwiched
in between Austria and Germany,
and only 45 miles from Vienna, scene
of most of the fighting. Czechs are
naturally worried, for some of their
Socialists have gone on strike sym
pathizing with their Austrian friend*.
Besides, it may be necessary for the
Czechs to invade Austria to keep
their frontiers free from fighting and
revolution. A German army is
waiting to invade Austria too if this
happens; so are some Italian soldiers
to the south.
It is the object of England to pre
vent all this if possible, forjt would
mean another European war. This

Ino easy job. Lots of Frenchmen
want England, Italy, and France to
invade Austria themselves and put a
stop to all this monkey-business.
Nearly everybody realizes that this
would only make things much worse.
So England in its traditional part of
peacemaker has sent its young, able
Capt. Eden to Paris, Berlin, and
Rome to negotiate a conference be
tween all the interested nations. In
the meantime, all eyes are on Aus
tria and Chancellor Dollfuss.
Austria—The Heart of Europe
Yesterday brought the news that
Austria's small but determined
Chancellor Dolfuss had crushed the
nation-wide Socialist revolution.
This fact i.s of tremendous signific
ance, for now more than over before,
the peace of Europe rests upon the
fate of little Austria.
The elimination of the Austrian
Socialists does clear up the picture,
but only a little: Dolfuss still has
to deal with a million or so German
Nazis within his country. They have
been sitting on the sidelines waiting
for their chance to seize ;he govern
ment; so have lots of their friends
just across the border in Germany.
Since he came into office nearly a
year ago, Dolfuss and his party have
been squeezed on one side by the
Socialists, on the other by the Nazis.
His way of getting out-of this tight
squeeze was to fight Socialist up
risings with one hand, while build
ing up an Italian brand of Fascism
with the other. Now that the Social
ists have been counted out, Dolfuss
will have to face the German Nazis
(Fascists). Austria's six neighbors
are looking anxiously over the fence,
waiting to see what will happen.
In spite of plenty of outside pres
sure, it looks as though Austria will
go Nazi before long. The chances
are that the country would not be
invaded by German soldiers, but
would team up with Hitler of its own
free will simply because Dolfuss had
nothing to offer. Naturally the men
who engineered this apparent union
between Germany and Austria
would take pains to assure the vlorld
that they would abide by the peace
treaties and would safeguard Aus
tria's independence. But the fact
remains that Austria would be run
from Berlin by Hitler. It is [his
strong possibility that interests Italy
and France.
A considerable part of northern
Italy borders on Austria. For over
ten years Mussolini has been trying
to dominate eastern Europe; now
Hitler wants to do the same. So far
Mussolini has beaten him to the
draw. Now a friendly, independent
Austria is a first class buffer between
Italy and Germany and an ace in the
