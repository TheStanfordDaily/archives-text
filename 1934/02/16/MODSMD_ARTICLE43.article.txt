# CWA Gets a Short Lease on Life
## 
### 
In what is perhaps best known as
the Washington alphabet soup, the
Civil Works Administration (CWA)
was to be the President's way of
taking 4,000,000 unemployed through
the winter. The original $400,000,000
appropriation gave them all sorts of
odd jobs all over the country. The
! wages were good, the men spent
their money freely, business im
proved accordingly. It is now the
President's plan to disband the CWA
| by May 1. By that time the new ap
propriation will have been spent,
.and Mr. Roosevelt hopes that private
industry will be able to use all the
men discharged from the CWA. To
ease the shock, one-quarter of the
number now employed will be re
i leased each month until May 1. By
that time Public Works projects and
j reviving business will probably take
care of at least a million of these
men.
But on the other hand, CWA jobs
; mean gravy for many voters, more
votes for many Congressmen. The
latter may want the CWA continued
at least until after elections this fall.
At any rate, it is awfully hard to let
| go of the tiger's tail.
