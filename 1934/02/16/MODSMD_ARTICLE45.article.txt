FOUR FRIGHTENED PEOPLE
(Parumount)
At the Varsity Theatre
Cecil B. DeMille surprises one
with a highly entertaining mixture
of farce and melodrama. For his
usual mountain of man-made spec
tacle, he substitutes authentic jun
gles exquisitely photographed. Amid
Natur's splendor he places five capa
ble actors, who enact a parody of all
Lust-in-the-Jungle films. Boland,
the birth control crusader, Colbert,
the lowa teacher, Marshall, the meek
chemist, Gargan, the Floyd Gibbons,
and Carrillo, their unfortunate guide
squeeze through bamboo thickets,
scramble through banyon trees,
sprawl through swamps, all in an ef
fort to reach Civilization.
Where the ordinary ugly duckling
blossoms into a lotus by tearing her
dress to rags, the luscious Colbert
loses her every stitch and dresses in
plantain leaves, a new costume every
day. With all the actors good, the
scenery unexcelled, the photography
superb, the tempo fast and exciting,
don't pay any attention to the dis
connected plot or the few serious
moments. They won't stand it. The
whole film is implausible, inconsis
tent, and utterly hilarious.
DeMille trademarks: Colbert's
waterfall bath—enough to make the
Roman Scandal girls blush for mod
esty—the realistic arrow through
Carrillo's jugular, and the spear
gored in Marshall's back.
The Right to Romance is an ob
vious problem play with a lethargic
climax and no excitement. After
long virgin years of prac'icing plas
tic surgery, Ann Harding craves ro
mance. She goes to California, mar
ries Robert Young, who is unfaithful
to her with the help of Sari Maritza,
whose face is later disfigured in an
airplane crash. The problem: Should
Harding restore the beauty of her
husband's mistress? The climax is
her inner struggle, which is unexcit
ing and flat. The film's only pleasant
ness comes from Miss Harding's
warm acting, the gentility of the
clothes and sets, the geneial likca
bleness of the supporting cast.

DOUBLE BILL
At the California Theatre |
The Sphinx (Monograph)
Remember the gag which went, j
"One guy couldn't be so awful, he j
must be twins?" Well, in this epic
production the studio must huve •
realized that Lionel Atwill was tooj

bad to be true, because they made
him twins.
That is one of the tricky twists to
as infantile a "mystery"' as has ever
been filmed, involving four motive
less murders, two motivated ones,
and a hint of past misdeeds. The
love interest is supplied by stock
story No. 13, Series B—juvenile lead
extricates ingenue from situation in
which her stubborn refusal to heed
him has involved her, and thus wins
her.
The entertainment value of this |
picture is pretty high if you are one
of those who laugh instead of suf
fering, at a supremely badly written,
directed, and acted picture.

Edmund Lowe performs in this
one as the director who picks up a
circus girl, makes her into a syn

and eventually throws over his fi- '
ancee to bring the find back to Hol

has run away back to the circus
upon exposure of the Swede hoax.
He comes through with his regular
characterization of a smooth lad in
pretty much his worst style. Anna
Sothern is only fairly good-looking
and a mediocre (even for Hollywood)
actress, but she gets by better than
Miriam Jordan, who furnishes the j
most unintentionally comic portrayal

of a jealous fiancee that can lie im

There is some .singing done, chiefly
by Miss Sothern, and she seems to
be pretty good, but the recording is
so execrable that that part of the
picture isn't enjoyable either.
The whole thing is pretty thjn
