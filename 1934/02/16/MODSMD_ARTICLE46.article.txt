# Cottrell, Roth Favor Revised County Charter
## 
### 
Student political excitement on
the campus now dead, Stanford Pro
fessor Edwin A. Cottrell and Comp
troller Almon E. Roth are forging
to the front in political activity cen
tering in the little town to the
northeast of the campus named Palo
Alto, and the various hamlets seat
tcred through Santa Clara county,
where much political hubbub and
humbug is being stirred up about
the proposed Santa Clara County
Charter to be voted on next Tues
day.
Professor Cottrell was the adviser
to the committee of 15 freeholders
v/hich drew up the charter, and
Comptroller Roth is one of the im
portant supporters of the charter.
Two opposing factions are lined
up on the subject, who are vitally
enough interested in the outcome to
pay for full-page ads in local pa
pers casting slams at each other.
The so-called Citizens' Protective
League opposes the charter, while
the Central Committee for the
Charter is advocating a change lrom
what they claim is an inefficient and
overlapping government. The char
ter provides for a modied county
manager form, with a centralization
of powers.
Debate and discussion on the pro
posed charter will be held in two
public meetings tonight and Mon
day. Tonight, Kenneth McDougall,
Palo Alto attorney, will speak for
the charter, being opposed by Paul
Teal in a debate, discussion follow
ing from the floor, at the Palo Alto
Community Clubhouse at 7:43 o'-
clock.
Comptroller Almon E. Roth will
speak at an open forum in the
Little Theatre in favor of the char
ter Monday evening at 8 o'clock.
The opponents have not yet desig
nated a speaker for their side.
