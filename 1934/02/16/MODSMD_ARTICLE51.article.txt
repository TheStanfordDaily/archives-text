place man in last year's Jo fire de- |
bate, experienced scholar and trav-
I eler, and Abe Mellinkoff, ex-editor 1
[ of the Daily, law student, and an j
j outstanding undergraduate debater
| in his day. Both are among the best
speakers Stanford h;:s produced in
recent years.
Fullenwider Chairman
i Chairman for the discussion will
be Frank Fullcnwider, who has offi
l ciated at one previous Forum. He i
will allot the main speakers a iim- J
i ited time for introductory argu- (
, ments, will then put them on the j
j stand for questioning by the au- !
j dience, and end with a series of j
| five-minute limit speeches from the
floor. Finally, harangue - handler |
Fullen wider will call for a vote on ,
the question from Ihe audience, with |
\ the suffrage being extended only to I
Stanford students and faculty. Ad-
I mission to the Forum, however, is j
j granted to outsiders as well as to |
campus inhabitants.
No vote was taken at the last !
J meeting of the Forum, which dis- I
! cussed capitalism and collectivism, |
due to the discrepancy between the j
! question as actually stated and the I
angle from which it was discussed ;
1 by the main speakers, Matthew j
! Evans and Austin Fife.
