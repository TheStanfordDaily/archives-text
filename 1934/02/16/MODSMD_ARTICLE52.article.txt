—Kentucky Derby candidates are
training in earnest at the Churchill
Downs and Douglas Park tracks.
Mrs. L. J. Hickman's Dusty Dawn
went three furlongs in 0:39. at the
downs; A. hf Gordon's Sir Thomas
turned in a fast two-mile gallop at
the park track; and other racers were
tested or breathed at both ovals.
