# AERONAUTICS BOOK BY DURAND FINISHED
## Final Proofs for First Of Six Volumes Submitted 
### 
Final page proofs of the first vol
ume of "Aerodynamic Theory: a
Review ol Recent Progress in Aero
nautics" in six volumes have been :
mailed to Germany by Professor-
Emeritus William F. Durand of the
University. g
These six volumes, soon to be
published by Springer and Company ,
oi Berlin, are intended to mark a j
milestone in the record of aviation j
research. The work of editing the
contributions of the twenty world I
authorities on the theories underly- |
ing this most modern mode of trans
portation was begun by Dr. Durand
in 1928 shortly after his retirement
from active teaching responsibili
ties in the University.
Fundamentals Outlined
A part of the contribution to
progress made under the Guggen
heim Foundation for the Promo-1
tion of Aeronautics, of which Dr.
Durand was a trustee, these vol
umes gather together all the fun
damental aerodynamic principles,
established to date and thus pro- ;
vide a "jumping-off place" from
which the record of further research
can proceed.
Dr. Durand will give a few of the j
more popular high-lights from his '
knowledge of the subject over the i
radio during the Stanford Hour on j
February 2G.
