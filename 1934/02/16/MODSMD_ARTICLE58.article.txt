'"Sit Down Sam" Barry brings his
Southern California basketball team
to the Farm for their only 1934 ap
pearance in two games (his week
end. Aside from the bearing the se
ries may have on the conference
race, a defeat practically eliminating
any Trojan hopes for another cham
pionship, the games should be inter
esting to Stanford hoop fans in that
it will show the difference between
the brand of basketball really played
by U.S.C. and the brand it is re
ported to play.
This column is far from being pro-
Trojan—we'd rather see U.S.C. have
their ears beaten down than anyone
else with the exception of Califor
nia- but when it is reported that a
team plays an exceptionally rough
game as was reported after the last
Stanford-U.S.C. battle iuid the op
posing coach comes home and says
it was as clean a game as he saw all
year, something should be done to
clear up the situation.
IT WASN'T SO
ROUGH AFTER ALL
According to newspaper reports,
the game "was one of the roughest
ever seen" in Los Angeles, but the
first inkling Coach John Bunn got of
the roughness of the affair was when
he returned to Stanford and read the
reports of Northern California news
papers. Bunn said he thought it was
a cleaner game than most of the
rest played this season.
Records of fouls certainly bear out
Ihis belief.-Twenty-five were called
in the last Stanford-U.S.C. fracas,
but a week later 33 were called when
the Indians played at Berkeley, and
in the second Card-Bruin game last
week, a new high was reached with
36. Stanford rooters, always prone to
jump on the officials, might blame
this difference on local referees,
which brings us to another point.
BOOING MAKES
MATTERS WORSE
Stanford rooters have become fa
mous for their lack of common cour
tesy at basketball games. It is ar
gued that it is the crowd's inalienable
l ight to boo officials, but whether it
is or not the result is the defeat of
their own interests.
11 is supposed that rooters go to
gemes for two reasons: to see their
team win and to enjoy the game.
It certainly jeopardizes a team's
chances of victory to antagonize the
officials to such an extent that they
are willing to take it out an the home
team by calling fouls closer than
r.ecessary and calling technical fouls
on the crowd. Fouls have often
proven Ihe margin of victory in close
games.
Neither is it conducive to an in
teresting game to boo. is noth
ing more uninteresting than a slow
basketball game. Boos slow up the
game in that they influence officials
to call fouls closer, the game being
stopped more often for free throws,
and because of the fact that the ref
eree is forced to hold up the game
until the booing subsides.

BOOING MAKES
MATTERS WORSE
Stanford rooters have become fa
mous for their lack of common cour
tesy at basketball games. It is ar
gued that it is the crowd's inalienable
l ight to boo officials, but whether it
is or not the result is the defeat of
their own interests.
11 is supposed that rooters go to
gemes for two reasons: to see their
team win and to enjoy the game.
It certainly jeopardizes a team's
chances of victory to antagonize the
officials to such an extent that they
are willing to take it out an the home
team by calling fouls closer than
r.ecessary and calling technical fouls
on the crowd. Fouls have often
proven Ihe margin of victory in close
games.
Neither is it conducive to an in
teresting game to boo. is noth
ing more uninteresting than a slow
basketball game. Boos slow up the
game in that they influence officials
to call fouls closer, the game being
stopped more often for free throws,
and because of the fact that the ref
eree is forced to hold up the game
until the booing subsides.

ROUGH AFTER ALL
According to newspaper reports,
the game "was one of the roughest
ever seen" in Los Angeles, but the

the roughness of the affair was when
he returned to Stanford and read the
reports of Northern California news

a cleaner game than most of the
