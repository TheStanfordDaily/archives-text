# TRACKMEN REST AS RAIN SWAMPS OVAL
## Freshmen Dig in Preparing For San Mateo Meet 
### 
Yesterday's track practice was
more on the holiday theme, with
the rain scaring away most of the
men, only a sparse handful coming
out, and as Angell Field track was
quite sloshy they ran on the lawn
inside the stadium cinders.
Bill Ellington's frosh are starting
to push up to their peak, with the
first meet of the season looming for
a week from tomorrow, when San
Mateo J.C. comes down to do battle.
Some of the Jaysees were on hand
Wednesday, and two men looked
good, Ray Dean in the sprints and
Warren Dixon in the 880.
Carlton Thorns. Dean, and Chuck
Voigt of the frosh dan a 10 flat
hundred, so close you could have
thrown a towel over all three at
ihe finish. Dixon ran a couple of
varsity runners into the ground in
his half, finishing nicely in 2:02.8.
There will be a nice race if March
and McCurdy of the frosh take the
marks against him Saturday. San
Mateo looks pretty strong all the
way around.
An encouraging performance was
turned in Wednesday by Truck Del
linger, the plowing sophomore, who
ran his best quarter of the year, and
probably second to only Eastman
and Blackmail, stopping at 51.7. He
looked better all over, starting fast
er, lengthening his stride in the
backstretch, and really hitting the
finish at full speed. If he keeps
getting down, the relay will be
f,tlengthened considerably.
