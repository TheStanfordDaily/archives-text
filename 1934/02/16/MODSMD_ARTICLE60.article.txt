# Warden Has Enviable Record
## 
### 

Lee F. Atkinson, state and federal game warden at Maxwell, Colusa
county, Cal., lias set up an enviable record as a migratory game
protector during the past season. The seven automatic shotguns
seized from market duck hunters are equipped so that law breakers
can quickly supplement the magazine with another "Long Tom"
cylinder, loosing 11 shots in as many minutes.
