# STANFORD TENNIS MEN MEET VERSATILE WINGED 'O' TEAM IN MATCHES TOMORROW
## 
### 
Coming up against some strongly
balanced competition, Stanford's var
sity netmen meet the versatile Olym
pic Club tennis players tomorrow
afternoon at 2 o'clock, providing that
rain does not leave the courts too
slippery.
Because the Indians lack in bal
ance, tomorrow's will be a test to
see whether strength cannot be de
veloped in the last three singles po
sitions, as well as forming stronger
doubles teams.
Playing for the club will be Bob
McKellop, Dick Blasgower, George
Green, and Martin Kenealy. All
these men hold rankings in North
ern California tennis circles, and all
are capable of extending the Stan
ford netters to their best.
Probably the singles feature of the
afternoon will be the meeting be
tween Chuck Otis, captain of the
varsity team, against Bob McKellop,
former player at Stanford. However,
last week when campus fans antici
pated a good fight between Larry
Hall, former captain, and Otis, the
latter surprised by the excellence of
his game, took down the veteran,
6-3; 6-0.
Playing in the number two spot
will be Sammy Lee, who has resisted
any challenge attempts to take this
position away from him. John Law,
finally approaching season form, will
play the number three position, with
Glenn Reed, Monty Shwayder and
one other varsity man in the sixth
position.
It will be one of the final practice
matches before the actual conference

I season begins on March 1.
At 10 o'clock tomorrow morning,
the Babe netmen take on Golden
| Gate Juniors in a torrid fii'st prac
j tice match. These San Francisco
' players have developed many real
champions, and are prepared to give
Dey, Captain Seward, and the other
j frosh a good battle.
