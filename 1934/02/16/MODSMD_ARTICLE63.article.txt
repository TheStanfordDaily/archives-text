# INDIAN NINE WILL MEET ATHENS CLUB TOMORROW
## 
### CHUCK CLANCY 
Imbued with a new confidence in its own power as a result of Wednes
day's decisive win over the Kenealy Seals, Coach Harry Wolter's lusty
crew of baseballers takes the field tomorrow against the Athens Club
resolved to wipe out the 7 to (5 defeat handed to the Indians in the first
game of the season by the aforementioned clubmen.
The game takys on added significance In that it marks the last appear
ance of the Indians before the initial Conference battle against St. Mary's

March 10, and a victory will give the<
varsity a balanced 'practice record
of two wins and two defeats.
Harry Wolter faces the dilemma
this year which coaches in any
sport dream about. He has such a
wealth of good material from which
to choose a starting line-up that
picking a superior nine becomes a
difficult task. This is especially true
in the outfield.
New Men in Line-up
Three new faces appeared in
Wednesday's lineup in the outer
gardens, and their work was so
pleasing that tomorrow they again
win the opening assignments over
Captain Dick Miles, "Bones" Ham
ilton, and Mort Nutting—the origi
nal first stringers. This trio—"Monk"
Moscrip, Jack Beech, and Jim Neu
man—showed great form against the
Seals both at bat and on the field.
Fred Heringer, the fastest pitcher
on the squad, will open on the
mound.
