# CARD RUGGERS PLAY TWO THIS TOMORROW
## 
### 
Internecine warfare breaks out
here tomorrow between Stanford
rugby players when the Lane Hos
pital medics journey down from San
Francisco to play the Stanford Rugby
Club. The game will be a regular
Northern California Rugby Union
performance, with a preliminary be
ginning at 1:30 o'clock between the
Stanford seconds and Fresno State
College.
Stanford is undefeated but now
nestles in second place in league
standings, following their 818 tie with
the Olympic Club last week. That
result gave the Olympians one tie
and Stanford a pair, so the clubmen
have grabbed the league title.
Coach Maloney has called prac
tice sessions every day until the Cal
ifornia game on Washington's birth
day is played. The Indians expect
to breeze through their pair of games
tomorrow with ease, but California's
Bears are known to be a formidable
team, albeit they are resting near the
bottom of tine league at present.
The games tomorrow were at first
scheduled for aid of the students'
unemployment funds, but due to the
excess of athletic events on the Farm,
admission will be free.
