# LIQUOR BOARD AGAIN
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 15 (UP).
â€” Attorney General U. S. Webb
ruled here today that the State Board
of Equalization may suspend or re
voke liquor licenses without a hear
ing. As interpreted by Webb the
state liquor control act gives the
board full powers in administering
provision of control. Twenty-five
suspended licensees have asked the
board for hearings, which probably
will start next weeks.
