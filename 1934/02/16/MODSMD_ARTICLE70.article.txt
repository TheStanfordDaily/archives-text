# Topping Joins Cards For Trojan Invasion
## 
### CHUCK CHAPPELL 
Willi Keith Topping ready to play if not to start. Stanford's basketball
men, hopeful of repeating their southern triumph, will tackle S.C. s power
ful Trojans at 8:15 o'clock tonight and tomorrow night in the Stanford
Pavilion.
Marking L'.S.C.'s first appearance here this year, the game is expected
to be another hard-fought, exciting struggle like most Indian-Trojan en
counters. Although the Southerners may "be favored because of their win
over California last week, Stanford is nevertheless conceded as good, if not
better, a chance than in the previous series with the Trojans.

Topping, out of the U.C.L.A. se-<
l ies, will be back in form and raring
to go as he usually is against S.C.
Though the Trojans usually watch
Bunn's star forward pretty close, he
generally manages to sneak in a few
buckets despite their efforts to stop
him.

Gorier May Start

Whether Topping or Gorter would
start at the left forward post had
not been decided yesterday by Dunn,
but it was certain that both would

play. Topping will be forced to wear
a mask which, however, didn't seem
to handicap him much in last night's
practice session.
Wytze Goiter, who starred against
U.C.L.A., carrying off high-point
honors for the series, will see a good
deal of i.otion. Arne Anderson will
start al the other forward post where
he will probably give tho Trojans a
good deal of trouble. With 13 points,
Anderson was high-point man in
Stanford's victory over the Trojans
three weeks ago.
Edclcn at Center
Captain Hal Edelen will start at
center, as usual, where lie will prob
ably receive the brunt of the task of
stopping "Rubberlegs" Guttero. With
Gordy Mallatratt still laid up in the
hospital, Al Page will probably get
the call at guard.
Both Page and Lind.sey showed up
.veil against the Bruins so that the
latter will undoubtedly play, whether
he starts or not. Charlie Rogers, big
and capable guard, will do his bit to
stop the Trojan sharpshooters at the
other defensive post.
Cowing Counted On
Although not slated to start, Emil
Cowing, one of the best shots 011 the
squad, will also see action at forward.
Cowing, a junior transfer, played
prep basketball at Piedmont High,
ilma mater of Hal Edelen and How
â€¢11 Turner, of frosh fame.
S.C.'s starting lineup will jjrob
ibly consist of Ward Browning and
Crnie Hoi brook or Browning and
,3axe Elliot at forwards, Guttero at
center, and Julie Bescos and Joe
{dlly at guards. Browning seems to
iave moved into a regular job since
he first of the season.
' Guttero Key Man
Stanford's chances for victory will
lepend largely on how weli Lee Gut
sro, high-scoring Trojan, is held
down. In the second game of the last
S.C. series Guttero was held to seven
points, his lowest total of ihe season.
Rooters' tickets, necessary for ad
mission to both games, can be pur
chased for 40 cents.
