# Babes Prepare For Menlo and Mission Games
## 
### 
Two more wins should be added io '
the already long string of victories
hung up by the 19134 Stanford irosh
this week-end when the Babes meet
Menlo Junior College and Mission
High School of San Francisco in the
preliminaries to the Stanford vs.
U.S.C. varsity battles.
Tonight's Menlo game may do- !
velop into quite a tussle, but the
junior college's past record gives the j
yearlings a decided edge. The J.C.
has a pair of tricky forwards who
have made trouble for other lrosh
and prep fives in this district, but i
the tight defensive game played by 1
the Papooses should keep down the
Menlo scoring column. Both teams
type of defense, two out and three
back.
Coach Bud Hawkins, captain of the I
Stanford varsity basketball five sev
eral years back, has a high scoring ;
forward in Thompson, who can usu- .
ally be counted on for 10 or 12 points j
per game. An injury may keep
Thompson out of tonight's fray, how- <
ever.
Menlo jGoocl
At the other forward post will be j
Comba, noted as a tricky floor man. j
The Menloites' defense is mainly j
handled by Lourdeaux, with a repu- j
tation as steady under the bucket. |
At the other guard job will be Pohn- |
son, while Sadlar will handle the !
center court duties.
Mission High School, Saturday j
night's opposition, is the door mat of !
the San Francisco prep league, and j
has had a meagre amount of success I
with its 1934 season. On the basis of !
comparative scores, the Babes should 1
wallop the Eears.
Second Team
While the second five, including
Allen Duncan and Dale Huff, for- j
wards, and Larry Randall and Jim
Dillon, guards, will probably play a i
good part of both games. Coach!
Jimmy Bradshaw will start his first
five, let them clinch the ball game !
before sending in the seconds, in- j
stead of relying on a last period come 1
through, which nearly cost the Babes
the Salinas High game last Friday
night.
Zamloch Back
This week's frosh practice made j
news in the return to scrimmage of j
Arch Zamloch, stocky guard forced j
out of play five weeks ago with a I
badly injured leg, and the swishers j
of Bill Quade, first-string right for- i
ward. Zamloch's speed is consider- |
ably cut down, but he should see ac- j
tion during the week-end. Quade's j
consistent tallying Tuesday night rnd ;
during recent practices will make :
him dangerous tonight and Saturday. 1
Tonight's starting lineups: Stan
ford frosh — Howell Turner and
Quade, forwards; La Rue Smith, !
center; Dinty Moore and Carl Schoit,
guards.

news in the return to scrimmage of j
Arch Zamloch, stocky guard forced j
out of play five weeks ago with a I
badly injured leg, and the swishers j
of Bill Quade, first-string right for- i
ward. Zamloch's speed is consider- |
ably cut down, but he should see ac- j
tion during the week-end. Quade's j
consistent tallying Tuesday night rnd ;
during recent practices will make :
him dangerous tonight and Saturday. 1
Tonight's starting lineups: Stan
ford frosh — Howell Turner and
Quade, forwards; La Rue Smith, !
center; Dinty Moore and Carl Schoit,
guards.
Two more wins should be added io '
the already long string of victories
hung up by the 19134 Stanford irosh
this week-end when the Babes meet
Menlo Junior College and Mission
High School of San Francisco in the
preliminaries to the Stanford vs.
U.S.C. varsity battles.
Tonight's Menlo game may do- !
velop into quite a tussle, but the
junior college's past record gives the j
yearlings a decided edge. The J.C.
has a pair of tricky forwards who
have made trouble for other lrosh
and prep fives in this district, but i
the tight defensive game played by 1
the Papooses should keep down the
Menlo scoring column. Both teams
type of defense, two out and three
back.
Coach Bud Hawkins, captain of the I
Stanford varsity basketball five sev
eral years back, has a high scoring ;
forward in Thompson, who can usu- .
ally be counted on for 10 or 12 points j
per game. An injury may keep
Thompson out of tonight's fray, how- <
ever.
Menlo jGoocl
At the other forward post will be j
Comba, noted as a tricky floor man. j
The Menloites' defense is mainly j
handled by Lourdeaux, with a repu- j
tation as steady under the bucket. |
At the other guard job will be Pohn- |
son, while Sadlar will handle the !
center court duties.
Mission High School, Saturday j
night's opposition, is the door mat of !
the San Francisco prep league, and j
has had a meagre amount of success I
with its 1934 season. On the basis of !
comparative scores, the Babes should 1
wallop the Eears.
Second Team
While the second five, including
Allen Duncan and Dale Huff, for- j
wards, and Larry Randall and Jim
Dillon, guards, will probably play a i
good part of both games. Coach!
Jimmy Bradshaw will start his first
five, let them clinch the ball game !
before sending in the seconds, in- j
stead of relying on a last period come 1
through, which nearly cost the Babes
the Salinas High game last Friday
night.
