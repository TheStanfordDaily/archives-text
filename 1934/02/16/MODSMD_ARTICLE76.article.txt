# Senior Women Defeat Frosh
## 
### 
In what was probably the most
exciting game of the women's bas
ketball tournament so far, the sen
ior first team defeated the freshman
first team 18 to 17, yesterday after
noon, with the winning goal made
by Ruth Fisher after the whistle
had blown.
The freshmen led the seniors
throughout the game, usually by
four or five points with the score 13
to 8 at the half.
In the last few minutes of play
Helen Grover broke the 16-10 tie
by a free throw for the freshmen,
giving them a one-point lead which
was reversed in the seniors' favor
by Ruth Fisher's spectacular bas
ket.
Caroline Mudd rang up the larg
est count for the freshmen with nine
points with Ruth Fisher and Dor
othy Swan coming close with seven
points each for the seniors.
Because of the ruling that sub
stitutes on the first teams could not
play on the second teams, the senior
second team was forced to default
to the sophomore seconds and also
to the freshmen, because of lack of
players. That rule has been changed
by the W.A.A. board.
