### 
MIAMI, Feb. 15 (UP).â€”Gene Sar
r.zen yesterday predicted that the
British will this year win the Walk
er Cup. "If the Walker Cup was
played four to a side I'd go heavily
on our boys," he said, "but the Brit
ish are better golfers." He picks
Francis Ouimet, Johnny Goodman,
George Dunlap, and Will Turnesa as
the four Americans, but stresses the
lack of additional talent of a cali
ber to meet the large number of
excellent British golfers who must
be reckoned with in Walker Cup
competition.
