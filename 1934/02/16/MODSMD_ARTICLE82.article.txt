# INDIAN TEAM COMPLETING PREPARATIONS FOR ARIZONA POLO INVASION NEXT WEEK
## 
### 
Preparing for their championship
series with Arizona, Stanford's po
loists wound up their last stiff
scrimmage session this week and
will spend the rest of their time
tapering off for the hard pair of
games with the Wildcats next week.
Provided there is no more rain
before next Thursday, Captain Gor
dan expects the Stanford field to be
in perfect condition by the time the
visitors arrive. Until the recent
rain, it had been too hard for the
horses.

Generally recognized as the two
best collegiate polo teams in the j
West, Stanford and Arizona annu- [
ally put on some of the fastest and
best-played games seen in this sec
tion.
Arizona's last visit to Stanford
j was made last spring when the In
dians succeeded in tying one game
' but losl the second. Since then the ,
two universities played a series at
Tucson kiqt Thanksgiving and'split
the two games, each team winning !
! one by about the same margin.

) Strengthened somewhat by the
| addition of Russell Rasmussen and
i Bob Fullerton, the present quartet
is conceded a better chance to up
! set the powerful Wildcats than any
I previous Stanford team. The rest
of the starting lineup will consist of
Captain Luppe Luppen and Bill
Rogers.
The Arizonans, piling up an im
pressive list of wins, added to their
j record recently by a victory over
j the strong Fort Bliss cavalry team.
