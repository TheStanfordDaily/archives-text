# FROSH DEBATE TEAM WILL TRAVEL SOUTH
## Trojan, L.A. High Clashes Are High Lights 
### 
For the first time in many years,
Stanford is prosperous enough to
send abroad a yearling debate team.
The freshmen making the South
ern California invasion are Captain
Marshall Dill, James Reynolds, Jack
Craven, Ed Shuck, Ed Janss, and
Bob Welch. The team plans to leave
February 21 and will be gone for
a week or ten days. They will prob
ably participate in ten or twelve de
bates.
Los Angeles
The principal opposition will be
furnished by the smooth-tongued
orators of Los Angeles and vicinity.
The first forensic hurdle will be to
meet the U.S.C. Trobabe debaters,
February 21. which promises to be a
spirited contest, for Trojan word
men are famed for fighting every
inch of the way in the decision de
bates. Afterward they will take on
Los Angeles Junior College in a
discussion of the presidential pow
ers question.
High School Debates
One of the features of the south
ern tour will be a debate with Hol
lywood High School, a .school of
2,500 students, and will be of the
decision type. The next verbal bar
rier to be encountered will be fur
nished by Los Angeles Municipal
High School with whom two debates
will be staged, probably before
large audiences. The last word
meet will be with Occidental fresh
men, and as Occidental has always
gone in for debate in a big way,
the competition will be stiff.
Coach Lee Chapin believes that
the present freshmen squad xepre
sent the best debating material in
years, which is one of the reasons
for the tour. Several of these de
baters have stellar prep records in
public speaking and should develop
into excellent varsity material.
