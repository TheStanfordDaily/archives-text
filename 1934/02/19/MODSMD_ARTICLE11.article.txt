# E.A. COTTRELL TO TALK OVER RADIO TONIGHT
## "Too Many Governments" Titles Weekly Radio Series Number FAVORS UNIFICATION New County Charter Before People Today Backed By Professor 
### 
"Too Many Governments" will be
the subject discussed by Professor
Edwin Angell Cottrell when he
speaks tonight on the Stanford Uni
versity Hour, given at 7:45 o'clock
over radio station KPO.
Professor Cottrell is head of the
Political Science Department of the
University as well as chairman of the
School of Social Sciences. He is an
authority on matters of local gov
ernment, having served on the exec
utive council of the American Poli
tical Science Association as well as
that of the National Municipal
League.
Favors Unification
Unification of the existing govern
ments in order to obtain as little
duplication of effort as possible
would result in more efficient gov
ernment with much less expense, be
lieves Professor Cottrell. It is ob
vious that disease epidemics and
grass fires do not stop when they
reach a county border, but under
the present organization of govern
ing bodies, such calamities must be
fought in such a way that relief
agencies conflict and interfere with
each other, causing great loss of
time and money. All governmental
activities such as these should, ac
cording to Professor Cottrell, be con
sidered as functional rather than ar
bitrary units.
Supports Charier
During the past month Professor
Cottrell has devoted much of his
time to an effort to pass the new
Freeholders' charter proposed for
Santa Clara County, which will be
put to a vote tomorrow. He (has
helped in an advisory capacity to
frame this and several other county
charters aiming at the elimination
of duplicated effort in smail districts
when dealing with special govern
mental activities.
Progress Made
Much progress has been made'
during the past few years in facing
this situation. Many states have
been experimenting with reorgan
ized departments and are showing
considerable results, while some are
studying the necessity of meeting the
governmental needs of communnies
too poor to meet the minimum re
quirements of a good government.
Professor Cottrell will explain what
advances have been made at pres
ent, and will show how methods
learned in this way can be applied io
other like situations.
