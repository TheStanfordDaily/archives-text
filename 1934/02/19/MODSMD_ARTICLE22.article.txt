# Albert Guerard Thinks General War Impossible
## 
### RUSSELL PAINE 
Agreeing with numerous other au
thorities on world situations, Profes
sor Albert Guerard believes that a
general war on the European con
tinent is impossible.
Guerard, who is professor of Gen
eral Literature in the English De
partment at Stanford and one of the
foremost authorities in the country
on French situations, explains his
stand on the fact that Germany is
not prepared for war.
The present Austrian crisis will
not, he believes, become serious.
France has no desire for war, and
due to her central position which
forces her into any European con
flict that is precipitated, will try to
prevent any general clash.
France's present stand against dis
armament, Guerard says, is based
upon her demand for two conditions
befyre French armaments are de
creased. These are the definite man
ifestation of Germany to give up all
thought of war, and the establish
ments of some kind of international
guarantee.

It was the indefiniteness of the
foreign policy in France that caused
the recent civil strife within that
country, Guerard maintained. Not
socialists or laborites started the
clash, but loyalists who wanted a
definiie foreign stand, he said.
The trouble was not serious.
France has come out of it with little
change, the government being per
haps a little more vigorous now, ex
plained Guerard. Favoring the re
publican form of government in
France, Guerard said, "the French
haven't the slightest desire to have a
dictatorship."
He holds that a democratic form
of government is much more perma
nent than a dictatorship, despite the
seeming strength and efficiency of
the Hitler and Mussolini regimes.
The only probable change in
France resulting from the uprising,
Guerard says, is the tendency to
ward the strengthening of the French
executive through the establishment
of a safer term of office.
