# B.C. RUGGERS PLAN TRIP TO BAY REGION
## California and Stanford All-Star Games Set For Early March 
### Millard Browne 
The all - star British Columbia
rugby team definitely will play three
games, underwritten by Stanford and
California, in northern California
early in March, the B.A.C. an
nounced last night.
The Canadian team will be made
up of the best players in all (he
universities and clubs under the
jurisdiction of the British Colum
bia Rugby Union, and probably
will arrive on the Farm next Tues
day, February 27.
The British Columbia authorities
just accepted the joint Stanford-
California proposal over the week
end, and arrangements for the so
journ are not entirely complete.
Dates Set
Three games are definitely sched
uled, as follows:
March I—B.C. vs. Stanford, here.
March 3—B.C. vs. California, at
Berkeley.
March 10—B.C. vs. Club All-Stars
(university players not eligible), in
San Francisco.
Squad Powerful
The Canadian squad will be pow
erful, and it will show rugby as it
should be played, according to Harry
Maloney of the Stanford team. Stan
ford will meet the Northerners in
the first game, when they are fresh
and have two days of rest on the
Farm, and a well-played and close
game is assured.
All three games are being spon
sored by California and Stanford to
gether. The third game, with the
Club All-Stars, probably will be
played in Kezar Stadium.
The British Columbia players may
meet San Francisco University in a
fourth game. This tilt probably
would be played March 7. The joint
Card-Bear sponsoring will not in
clude this fourth encounter.
