# Galitzi Talks On Balkans

### 
Recent trends in the Balkan peace
movement will be discussed by Dr.
Christine Gaiitzi at 7:30 o'clock to
morrow night in the Assembly Hall.
She will explain the co-operative
movement in promoting peaceful re
lations within the Balkan States and
tell why the assassination of Premier
Duca was not a death blow to this
movement despite Hitlerist attempts
to bring about Pan-Germanism or
Pan-Nordism through the diploma
tic entcnts of national Socialist dic
tators.
Miss Gaiitzi, a personal friend of
Queen Marie of Rumania, was born
in Greece but moved to Rumania at
an early age. She took her B.A. and
Certificat de License at the Univer
sity of Sourbonne in 1922, was the
recipient of a fellowship from the
Rockefeller Foundation which en
abled her to take her Ph.D. at Co
lumbia University.
Returning to Rumania, she was
appointed acting director of the Pub
lic Welfare Division of the Ministry
of Labor, Health, and Public Wel
fare. In 1931 she began to teach
sociology and French at Scripps Col
lege. She served as exchange pro
fessor to the National University of
Mexico in 1932.
