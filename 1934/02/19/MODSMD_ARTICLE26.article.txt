# Tryouts For Daily Posts Meet Today
## Plans for Trial Period To Be Explained 
### 
An opportunity to get on the Daily
gravy train will be offered students
who appear at the Daily tryoutee
meeting at 5 o'clock this afternoon
in the Journalism Library, second
door of the Press Building. The plan
to be followed in the semi-annual
editorial staff tryout period will be
explained 1o assembled neophytes by
Women's Editor Ellamae Dodds.
The one road all Daily reporters
must travel before they get on the
coveted staff position, the two-weeks'
tryout period, covers many phases
of newspaper work such as proof
reading and reporting, according to
Women's Editor Dodds.
Experience Not Needed
No previous experience in news
paper work, though valuable, is nec
essary. Careful ratings will be kept
upon ability revealed by tryoutees
during the two-week period and the
amount of work done.
Though requiring time and a lik
ing for newspaper work, a position
on the staff is one of the best meth
ods of getting acquainted with stu
dents in campus activities, and offers
an opportunity to rise to an exec
utive position on the staff.
Business Tryouts
Offering similar advantages Busi
ness Manager Louis Ottenheimer
announces that business staff tryouts
for freshman men and women will
begin this week. Interested students
are asked to report to the business
office in the Daily building.
Ottenheimer points to opportuni
ties available to tryoutees for actual
business experience, intimate con
tact with business men, experience
in campus activities, and a chance to
advance to a salaried position.
Advancements on both the edito
rial and business staff are made
every half year, and a good chance
for able students to become exec
utives is offered.
