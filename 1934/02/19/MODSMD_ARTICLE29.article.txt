### Frank Orr 
Moving to help students under fi
nancial difficulties who either would
be unable to continue in the Univer
sity or whose scholastic standing
would be endangered by too much
working time, the Stanford Board of
Trustees last week announced a fund
tc be raised by contributions.
Endorsed by President Ray Lyman
Wilbur and Leland Cutler, president
of the Trustees, the committee on the
new plan will be headed by Dr.
Harry B. Reynolds of Palo Alto, a
Stanford graduate with the Class of
1896. No definite goal has been set.
Dr. Reynolds pointed out, but the
purpose of the plan is to raise a large
sum of money for student aid pur
poses.
Appeal to Friends
''We are appealing to friends of
the University and far-seeing people
everywhere who are interested in
the cause of education to contribute
either large or small amounts to this
general fund," said an official state
ment.
The new move is not in the nature
of a campaign, Di\ Reynolds said,
but it is estimated about a year will
be required to raise a fund sufficient
to start the work.
President Wilbur on his return
from Chicago last week described
the plan as "a recognition by the
University of the r.eed for a large
fund which shall make it possible'to
help students pay all of the charges
for education when they cannot mcnt
part of them through their own ef
forts."
Wilbur Approves
Hearty approval of the move was
expressed by Dr. Wilbur when the
Trustees' plan was presented for his
consideration, and a survey of pos
sibilities of raising money will start
soon, according to Dr. Reynolds.
Before leaving for the East Fri
day night, Trustee Cutler also en
dorsed the plan. He said, "My asso
ciates on the Board have shown the
keenest interest in young men and
women who are struggling to sun
port themselves during their years of
getting an education.
"We want this type in our student
body. The founders intended the
institution to offer equal opportu
nity to all. Since we have been
forced to charge tuition the burden
has been too great for many. Hi nee
our appeal to the larger world to help
us build up a fund sufficient to carry
forward Stanford's great usefulness."

Appeal to Friends
''We are appealing to friends of
the University and far-seeing people
everywhere who are interested in
the cause of education to contribute
either large or small amounts to this
general fund," said an official state
ment.
The new move is not in the nature
of a campaign, Di\ Reynolds said,
but it is estimated about a year will
be required to raise a fund sufficient
to start the work.
President Wilbur on his return
from Chicago last week described
the plan as "a recognition by the
University of the r.eed for a large
fund which shall make it possible'to
help students pay all of the charges
for education when they cannot mcnt
part of them through their own ef
forts."
Wilbur Approves
Hearty approval of the move was
expressed by Dr. Wilbur when the
Trustees' plan was presented for his
consideration, and a survey of pos
sibilities of raising money will start
soon, according to Dr. Reynolds.
Before leaving for the East Fri
day night, Trustee Cutler also en
dorsed the plan. He said, "My asso
ciates on the Board have shown the
keenest interest in young men and
women who are struggling to sun
port themselves during their years of
getting an education.
"We want this type in our student
body. The founders intended the
institution to offer equal opportu
nity to all. Since we have been
forced to charge tuition the burden
has been too great for many. Hi nee
our appeal to the larger world to help
us build up a fund sufficient to carry
forward Stanford's great usefulness."
