# HUMANITY—ROOTED

Stanford's Hoard of Trustees, in their announcement to
come to the aid of financially embarrassed students, have
given the campus another example of how hitj I)it»' men
can he. Some thirty miles from the campus they convene
regularly to hear reports of student conditions from their
representative, the t'niversity president.
Many of their actions must he based on his judgment.
His efforts in this instance are purely on behalf of those
energetic individuals who cannot make ends meet. There
is no logical reason why a person arriving at the age when
education is the most important thing in the world to him
should not be accorded the chance to prove himself—if
he has done his part.
That is what the administration wants to do—assist
those individuals who, for no reason of their own, have
been unable to be self-su porting. I ndoubtdelv the results
will show that many students will be uncovered who other
wise never would have had the chance.
Possibly it will have a favorable reaction in educational
trends through the far-reaching effect of competition
against those who leisurely have strolled through school
with nothing to worry about except when the next month's
( heck is due.
Positively, it will have a far-reaching effect among
people on the outside, where Stanford's name already has
been favorably received.
