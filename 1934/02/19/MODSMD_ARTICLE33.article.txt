The Stanford basketball squad played two games with
t'.S.C. over the week-end and lost them both. (The losses
were immaterial.) Even the election of a new yell-leader
is not particularly significant— that happens twice yearly.
Jin t what was significant was the good sportsmanship
shown by Stanford rooters while their team ran into two
messes of hard luck and superior plav.
Perhaps for the tirst time in the history of Stanford
basketball teams, a game was played, and a losing one at
that, with practically no booing from the peanut gallery.
The second evening passed not quite as well, but the
improvement over offenses in the past is worthy of com
mendation. Before the game, Jim Triolo, just stepping
into A1 Pcache's boots, issued a plea for supporters to cut
(.lit the booing.
Yell leaders have made such appeals in the past. It
has become almost a ritual with them to make some sort of
feint in that direction. The student body had expected it.
II has rarely been disappointed.
Triolo is leading the way admirably. Now, the student
body is following. May it keep going in the same direction.
