A DOLL'S HOUSE (Ibsen)
At (lie Columbia Theatre
Even a superior production of "A
Doll's House"—which Eva LeGal
lienne's is—serves to demonstrate
the vast difference between the plays
of Ibsen and those of the [ resent day.
Many of the speeches are long' and
anti-climactic, and there is a great
deal of irrelevant action.
Ibsen's characters, however, ring
true, and they ring especially true
at the hands of Josephine Hutchin
son, Howard da Silva, Mi.ss LeGal
lienne, and the members of her com
pany. These players made strikingly
real the story of Nora Helmer with
her indiscreet borrowing of money
and her rebellion at the letter of the
law.
The role of Nora is an immensely
difficult one, for the actress must
first appear light, gay, and trivial—
the doll of her husband's house—and
in the final act accomplish a matur
ing of several years within the space
of a few; moments. Josephine Hut
chinson was at her best in this final
scene, and she handled exceptionally
well the long speeches ot the de
nouement. Her gaiety o r the first
acts —particularly her scene with the
children—was nicely in tone.
Miss LeGallicnne graciously chose
to enact the minor character of Mrs.
Linde, to which she gave a convinc
ing sympathy without overemphasis.
Miss LeGallienne has an interesting
voice which she used to advantage,
but her gestures in this role seemed
often stereotyped and meaningless.
Perhaps her most splendidly re
strained scene was played in the first
act with her back almost wholly to
the audience.
Howard da Silva evinced a thor
ough understanding of Thorvald
Helmer and likewise was at his best
in the final scene, in which he vainly
struggled to comprehend his wife.
Donald Cameron was the central
figure of one of the most moving
scenes of the play, that one in which
he, as Doctor Rank, tells Nora of his
iminent death. It was a particularly
fine moment in a fine performance.
Walter Beck's was an appropriately
menacing Krogstad.
