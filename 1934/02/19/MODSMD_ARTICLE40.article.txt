# WHY IT'S NEWS
## THE
						AIR MAIL MIXUP 
### CROMPTON BANGS Jr 
Tonight Army pilots and planes
j will begin to carry all the nation's
air mail. Tonight also some 500 vet
; eran pilots will carry their last sack
; of mail lor their companies under
I government contract. Tomorrow
! many of them will be minus their
| jobs, with nothing much to look for
ward to. President Roosevelt made
this sweeping change because he
firmly believed the whole private
aviation industry was rotten to +he
core. Looking at the situation, there
j are two things to consider: first, was
! there really much graft; second, can
| the Army fly the mails as safely and
j as promptly as the private compa
nies?
Was There Really Graft?
1 Some evidences of crookery un
! covered by the Senate investigation
are very convincing. There is no
doubt that there was collusion by
| private operators bidding for con
tracts—at the Government's expense
of course. Likewise, the small com
panies were locked out of a big
: company get-together held in ex-
Postmaster General Brown's office in
1930. It was at this meeting that the
1 "little fellows" were frozen out of
j any chance for the profitable mail
contracts. But the most suspicious
! thing is disappearance of some of
' Mr. Brown's letters about this.
Now it is admitted that all this made
j the industry looks pretty dirty, but
J the Presidential clean-up did not
j even bother to separate the eagles
j from the buzzards. Colonel Lind
bergh claimed that Mr. Roosevelt
had thus neatly condemned the
whole private aviation industry to
| death without a fair trial. He is
j probably right. Many companies got

their contracts and held them with
out any graft whatsoever. Appar
ently they will have no chance to
present their side.
Or Is it the System?
Any wider view of the whole mess
has to take in the air mail contract
system and the idea behind it. Con
gress wanted to subsidize private
aviation and expected to lose money
in the deal. Most government help
of this kind breeds graft. Congress
finally did what it could to stop it,
but the President with characteristic
courage had to step in. As a result,
plenty of ex-Administration back
teeth are rattling. If the Roosevelt
house - cleaning uncovers what he
thinks Is there, all well and good. If
not, he has made his first great mis
take.
Can the Army Do It?
At any rate, the Army has a big
job on its hands. To start with, it
has all the planes and pilots it will
need. But the planes are not as fast,
nor the pilots as experienced in
night and all-weather flying as those
of the private companies. Experience
has shown that high speed and fa
miliarity with the route covered are
the greatest safety factors in air mail
service. Besides, the Army will not
have the use—at least for the time
being—of the very helpful two-way
radio service maintained by United
Air, TWA, etc.
Two Army pilots were killed last
week while exploring the routes they
were to fly. Both accidents were due
to the lack of two-way radio and
unfamiliarity with the country. So
for the time being the air mail serv
ice will probably be slower, and pos
sibly more dangerous.
