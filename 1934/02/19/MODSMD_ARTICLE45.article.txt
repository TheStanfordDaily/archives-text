Evidently the U.C.L.A. Bruin got j
tired of running before the pack
with its tail between its legs (if ,
Bruins have tails) as it about-faced
Saturday night, kicking the dope |
bucket .sky high, and shipped its j
Bear cousin right in the lace. Inci- j
dentally, it tied up the southern di- j
vision basketball title chase tighter :
than a drum with U.S.C. aiid Califor
nia at the top of the heap with eight i
victories and two defeats dpiece.
Unless there is another upset next j
week-end, another play-off series j
between California and ihc Trojans ,
is in the offing. The race ended in a j
tie two years ago and the Bears won j
a two out of three post season series [
lor the championship.
Stanford, who apparently kicked
El Trojan out of its chances for the j
championship three weeks ago, now j
has an opportunity to kick him right |
back in again by defeating California 1
Friday and Saturday night. U.C.L.A. J
could do the same for the Bears by i
dropping U.S.C. in ono of the two '
games remaining in Ihoir annual '
civil war series.

Apparently the era of broken track j
records is destined to extend itself :
another year. At least the short j

own world high jump record Satur- j
day night at the New York A.C. j
track carnival, leaping (5 ft. 8% in.
The jump Seat Marty's old world i
mark, which he set last year, by an j
eighth of an inch. Keith Brown, I
Yale pole vaulter, seconded Marty's j
effort with a record-breaking per- j

4 in. in the same meet to set a new j
world indoor pole vaulting mark, j
shattering the old record held by j
himself by 2 '/i inches.
SUNKEN DIAMOND
CUTS DOWN HITS
The large size of Stanford's Sunk
en diamond apparently has its dis
advantages. In Saturday's . game j
against the Athens Club, Grayson j
and Heringer hit balls which would
have gone for home runs ; n the band
box parks used by the majority of
professional teams, but which were
caught here.
The length of the field gives out
fielders plenty of chance to cover
ground, cutting down extra-base hits
and putting base running at a pre- ■
mium. The Sunken diamond is said \
to be one of the best college ball j
fields in the West and better than !
many professional parks.

COAST lIOOP HACK
TIGHTER THAN DRUM
Evidently the U.C.L.A. Bruin got j
tired of running before the pack
with its tail between its legs (if ,
Bruins have tails) as it about-faced
Saturday night, kicking the dope |
bucket .sky high, and shipped its j
Bear cousin right in the lace. Inci- j
dentally, it tied up the southern di- j
vision basketball title chase tighter :
than a drum with U.S.C. aiid Califor
nia at the top of the heap with eight i
victories and two defeats dpiece.
Unless there is another upset next j
week-end, another play-off series j
between California and ihc Trojans ,
is in the offing. The race ended in a j
tie two years ago and the Bears won j
a two out of three post season series [
lor the championship.
Stanford, who apparently kicked
El Trojan out of its chances for the j
championship three weeks ago, now j
has an opportunity to kick him right |
back in again by defeating California 1
Friday and Saturday night. U.C.L.A. J
could do the same for the Bears by i
dropping U.S.C. in ono of the two '
games remaining in Ihoir annual '
civil war series.
LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER
RECORD-BREAKING YEAR
)
Apparently the era of broken track j
records is destined to extend itself :
another year. At least the short j
pants artists are starting early. Fres- j
no State's Walter Marty, jumping j
for the second time indoors, started j
the procession when ho broke his i
own world high jump record Satur- j
day night at the New York A.C. j
track carnival, leaping (5 ft. 8% in.
The jump Seat Marty's old world i
mark, which he set last year, by an j
eighth of an inch. Keith Brown, I
Yale pole vaulter, seconded Marty's j
effort with a record-breaking per- j
formance of his own, scoring 14 ft. |
4 in. in the same meet to set a new j
world indoor pole vaulting mark, j
shattering the old record held by j
himself by 2 '/i inches.
SUNKEN DIAMOND
CUTS DOWN HITS
The large size of Stanford's Sunk
en diamond apparently has its dis
advantages. In Saturday's . game j
against the Athens Club, Grayson j
and Heringer hit balls which would
have gone for home runs ; n the band
box parks used by the majority of
professional teams, but which were
caught here.
The length of the field gives out
fielders plenty of chance to cover
ground, cutting down extra-base hits
and putting base running at a pre- ■
mium. The Sunken diamond is said \
to be one of the best college ball j
fields in the West and better than !
many professional parks.
