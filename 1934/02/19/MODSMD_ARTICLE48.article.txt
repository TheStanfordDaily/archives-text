# STANFORD DROPS TWO TILTS TO S.C. BASKETBALL MEN
## 
### 
Threatening only in a brilliant
second-half comeback on Friday
night, Stanford's varsity cage men
found themselves otherwise incapa
ble of stopping the week-end on
slaught of S.C.'s basketeers, who
took the measure of the Indians by
28-22 and 33-22 scores.
The first game, which ended 28-
22, started off like a traditional Tro
jan walkaway with the visitors drop
ping through five field goals in a
row at one point and ending the half
with a decisived 17-8 advantage.
Holbrook led the first half attack
with eight points.
Comeback
Apparently outclassed, Coach
Bunn's men entered the second half
with little prospect of doing more
than submitting to a one-sided shel
lacking. Edelen and Cowing, how
ever, started things off by sinking a
couple of free throws. Then A1 Page,
who played an outstanding game all
evening, took matters in his own
hands and sank two field goals in a
row, besides doing some fancy ball
handling.
Topping Scores
Topping then proceeded to follow
with a free throw and a Tew seconds
later with a setup. Lindsey with a
free throw and Captain Hal Edelen
v/ith two successive goals then gave
Stanford a 22-21 lead while the
stands went wild. The Trojans had
been held to four points while the
Indians were making 14.
On the verge of biowing-up
completely, the Trojans finally
clamped down, largely through the
efforts of Julie Bescos, veteran
guard and coolest man on the
court. Three field goals and a free
throw by the Trojans while Stan
ford was held scoreless then wrote
finis to the soaring but brief hopes
of the Indians.
Saturday Game
Saturday night's game was much
more one-sided than the preceding
one, with Stanford failing to threaten
after the first few minutes of play.
A 4-3 lead through the efforts of
Keith Topping with two free throws
and a field goal was soon smashed
when the Trojans scored 11 points in
a row while holding Stanford score
less.
Emil Cowing then came into the
game and dropped in a free throw
and two successive long shots to put
Stanford back within the range of
S.C. Holbrook and Elliot then sank
field goals however to give the Tro
jans a 20-10 half time lead which
was held for the balance of the game.
