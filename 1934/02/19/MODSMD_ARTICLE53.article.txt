# '37 CAGERS BEAT MENLO, MISSION
## 
### 
With a burst of first quarter speed
in an overtime period, Stanford's
frosh five overcame the jinx of hot
basketball that kept them trailing
most of the game, and licKed Menlo
Junior College, 42-34. In Saturday
night's preliminary the Babes gained
an easy decision over Mission High,
27-19.
Forward Cuts Lead
Friday night the Card yearlings
seemed to have the play well, in
hand until a short and unpromising
looking forward, Bellacaire, took up
the Menlo cause. Though handi
capped by a deformed left hand
which forced him to take his shots
with a pushing motion, Beddacaire
started ringing the bucket with un
conscious. shots from the sidelines.
He played in the first half long
enough to bring the J.C.'s even,
20-20.
The last half was nip-and-tuck,
with Howell Tinner and Dinty Moore
keeping the frosh in the game by
tallying consistently. With only a
few minutes left to play, Beddacaire
tanked his seventh and last field
goal, and gave Menlo a 32-31 lead.
Smith of the Babes calmiy swished
a free throw to tie up the game a
few seconds before the gun barked.
Smith Ties Count
Going into the extra period Smith
counteracted a Menio bucket with
one of his own; then Menlo cracked.
With a flurry of set-ups the frosh
garnered an eight-point lead, made
a tough ball game look easy in the
scoring column, 42-34.

With a burst of first quarter speed
in an overtime period, Stanford's
frosh five overcame the jinx of hot
basketball that kept them trailing
most of the game, and licKed Menlo
Junior College, 42-34. In Saturday
night's preliminary the Babes gained
an easy decision over Mission High,
27-19.
Forward Cuts Lead
Friday night the Card yearlings
seemed to have the play well, in
hand until a short and unpromising
looking forward, Bellacaire, took up
the Menlo cause. Though handi
capped by a deformed left hand
which forced him to take his shots
with a pushing motion, Beddacaire
started ringing the bucket with un
conscious. shots from the sidelines.
He played in the first half long
enough to bring the J.C.'s even,
20-20.
The last half was nip-and-tuck,
with Howell Tinner and Dinty Moore
keeping the frosh in the game by
tallying consistently. With only a
few minutes left to play, Beddacaire
tanked his seventh and last field
goal, and gave Menlo a 32-31 lead.
