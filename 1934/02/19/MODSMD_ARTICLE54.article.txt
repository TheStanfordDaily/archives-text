A long triple over Captain Dick
Miles' head in deep center field from
the bat of H-ughie Nielsen, Athens
Club shortstop, and a wild pitch by
Fred Heringer allowing Nielsen to
cross the rubber sealed the doom of
the Cardinals here Saturday when
the clubmen scored their second tri
umph of the season over the Indians,
3 to 2. in the tenth inning.
Not until the last Stanford batter
had been set down was the outcome
of the game certain as the two teams
hooked up in the most exciting ball
game seen on the local lot this sea
son.
Threaten in Tenth
In the last half of the tenth Stan
ford made a thrilling bid for victory
when Heringer hit a long ball into
deep right-center which looked like
a sure safety. Wedio lancione, play
ing center field, thought differently,
j however, making a circus catch for
the second out of the inning. Frank
Tremaine struck out to end the game.
The Athens Club scored first when
one run by Joe Smith was shoved
across the plate in the second; the
Cardinals took the lead in the third,
as Jim Moscrip and Jack Beech
scored the only two Indian runs of
the game.
Stanford retained the lead until
the seventh when the visitors evened
the count at 2-2.
Ellsworth Fagundas pitched beau
tiful baseball, holding the slugging
Indians hitless after the fourth. Her
