# Y.M.C.A. Beats Stanford Tank Team, 57 to 24
## 
### 
Outclassed in all events but the
1 breast stroke and the medley relay,
j Stanford's varsity swimming team
| took a 57 to 21 lacing from the pow-
I erful San Francisco Y.M.C.A. iner
j men last Saturday afternoon in En
! cina pool.
Even the satisfaction of winning j
j the medley relay was deprived the
Card paddlers when their team was
i disqualified because of an illegal turn
: made by Bub Clark, who was back- J
stroking the first lap for Stanford. 1
Thus the on'y race credited to the
Stanford victory column was won by
Bob Foster, powerful and speedy
merman who won the 200 - yard
breast stroke by six yards in the
fast time of 2 minutes and 40.5 sec- j
! onds.
For the "Y," Art Lindcgrin, for
j mer Southern California prep
1 school flash, proved to he the real
J deciding factor in the victory as
well as being the individual star
of the meet. All the young fellow
did was to win the 100- and 200-
1 yard free style races and then to
gain six yards on Goqdy Graves,
! Card swimmer, in the last lap of
I the 400-yard free style relay, which
i was enough to cinch this event for
; the San Francisco hoys.
Besides Foster, Stanford's best
[ were Gardner and Godman who tied
j for second in the 50-yard tree style;

; Foster in the breast stroke and

I erful San Francisco Y.M.C.A. iner

j mer Southern California prep
1 school flash, proved to he the real
J deciding factor in the victory as
well as being the individual star
of the meet. All the young fellow
did was to win the 100- and 200-
1 yard free style races and then to
gain six yards on Goqdy Graves,
! Card swimmer, in the last lap of
I the 400-yard free style relay, which
i was enough to cinch this event for
