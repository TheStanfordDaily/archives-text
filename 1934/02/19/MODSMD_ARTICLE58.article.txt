## 
### 
VIENNA, Feb. 18 (UP). â€”Five
people were killed and sightseers
collecting souvenirs of the major
fight last week, were thrown imo a
desperate panic when fighting broke
out in Ihe native residence quarter
called the "American," because of
ihe proximity of George Washington
Court. It was really a workers' dis
trict. The warfare was between
workers and police.
Snipers' Toll
The fatalities came when unseen
snipers on roof tops began shooting
at police near Reurnan Court, a block
of flats located very near the George
Washington Court.
During the clay Chancellor Doll
fuss quickly and with an iron hand
suppressed al! insurrection that
threatened. A strong force of
Hcimweir was rushed into tlic dis
trict and started policing it.
The government also jailed a news
paper man, the Vienna correspondent
of the Jewish Telegraph Agency, and
also captured the most fenred So
cialist leader in the province of
Styria.
Quick Action
During the minor skirmishes of the
day the panic was almost as great as
that which followed the major artil
lery fire last week. As troops sur
rounded the sites of the skirmishes
with the Socialists, all street car
service and public utility service was
suspended.
From President Keinbock of the
Austrian National Bank word came
that "the happenings of last week did
not to any considerable extent affect
the economic life of Austria."
