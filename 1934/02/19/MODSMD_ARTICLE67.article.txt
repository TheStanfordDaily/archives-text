# SANTA ROSA EARTHQUAKES WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON STANFORD FAULTS-WILLIS

### Helene Ottenheimer 
The earthquakes which occurred.
' in Santa Rosa last week will have
j no effect on the Stanford campus j
| and its vicinity. This is the opinion
of Dr. Bailey Willis, noted authority
j on geology, who explains that the
San Andreas fault on which the Uni
| versity is located, and the Hayward
i fault, which runs through Berkeley
I and Santa Rosa, have no known
j connection.
The geologist deems the earth- j
J quakes which have shaken Santa
| Rosa up and dov/n, different from
; the common garden variety of shocks
j to which Californians are accus- |
tomed. He says that the up and
: down movement is peculiar and so ,
1 very local that only a limited cause
can be imagined, and could be at- i
tributed to a phase of local geology, j
I Santa Rosa is situated in an area
of volcanic rocks, and the gases |
which ordinarily accompany vol
j canic eruptions are still escaping j
! from considerable depths in the earth, i
Rising to where they burn, they heat
i the surface, just as a kettle is boiled
| on a gas range, and produce hot;

springs and geyser; in that vicinity.
One can imagine that gases may
burn at a greater depth, and may
melt the rock as they do in the crater
of Kilauea, Hawaii. If, then, water
should reach the lava, it would first
be absorbed as vapor in the molten
rock. The rock in cooling would ex
clude it as steam at a very high tem
perature and pressure, and would
cause an explosion. This is what
happened at Mt. Lassen in 1914, and
is what Professor Willis supposes has
occurred on a small scale at Santa
Rosa.
