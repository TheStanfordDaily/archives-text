# STOP DIVORCE RUSH
## 
### 
MEXICO CITY, Feb. 19 (UP).â€”
The government was investigating
today charges that many divorces
have been granted fraudulently to
Americans and that in some cases
forgery may have entered into the
granting of decrees. For weeks, the
government has been trying to stop
the rush of Americans to get easy
divorces in courts of some states
which'have liberal divorce laws.
