### Will Williams 
Dr. Christine Galitzi, "the woman
who can say more in 15 minutes than
most men can in an hour," according
to Graham Stuart of the Political
Science Department, will speak to a
Stanford Assembly Hall audience at
7:30 o'clock this evening. Her sub
ject: "Recent Trends in the Balkan
Peace Movement." t
Miss Galitzi has a wide back
ground of training which is unique
in that she was born in Greece, grew
i up in Roumania and was educated
at the Sorbonne. She is a personal
friend of the redoubtable Queen Ma
rie, and is widely known in intellec
. tual circles.
Intensive Training
j Miss Galitzi took her B.A. and her
Certificat de License from the Sor
bonne in 1922; the diploma of the
, New York School of Social Work in
1924. In 1926-29, she was the reci
i pient of a fellowship from the Rocke
feller Foundation which allowed her
I to carry on her investigation on the
Assimilation of the Roumanians in
the United States, and to take her
Ph.D. at. Columbia University.
Upon her return to Roumania, she
was appointed acting-director of the
Public Welfare Division of the Min
! istry of Labor, Health, and Public
Welfare. In 1931, she relurned to
America to teach at Scripps College
where she is giving courses in sociol
ogy and French. In 3932, Miss Galitzi
served as an exchange professor to
the National University of Mexico.
Charming Speaker
Reputed to be a woman of great
personal charm, Miss Galitzi adds
color and wit to the authority of her
background. In her talk on the Bal
j kans, she will point out the co-op
erative movement in cementing peace
, within the Balkan States.
According to Miss Galitzi, the as
| sassination of Premier Duca is not a
| death blow to this movement, de-
I spite the subversive Hitlerist propa
j ganda which is endeavoring to bring
j about Pan-Germanism or Pan-Nord
j ism, through the diplomatic entente
|of National-Socialist dictators. The
| Balkan States pursue the policy of
j co-operation, embodied in the ideal
| ism of the League of Nations, by ad
hering to a program of an economic
i and political rapprochement, through
preferential tariffs and an inter-Bal
j kan non-aggression pact.
