# Rally Heads Retain Stunts
## Committee to Negotiate For Free Colored Cards 
### 
The will of the "people" was taken
into consideration last night by the
Rally Committee who followed the
desire for retention of card stunts at
football games, indicated in the re
cent election, and decided that they
should not, pass into oblivion.
Coincident with the decision of the
committee, negotiations will begin to
obtain the necessary colored squares
free of charge from generous manu
facturers. A1 Snyder was appointed
to do the negotiating.
A motif for the annual Mask Ball,
slated for April 20, was decided upon
at the meeting and will be announced
a1 a later date. Plans for selection of
king and queen for the affair were
also discussed.
