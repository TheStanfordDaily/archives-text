### JACK NEWMAN 
Eight d'clocks were neglected and j
profs waited anxiously for their
classes yesterday, but nothing hap
pened.
An interruption in current, com
bined wilh elcctric alarm clocks,
caused the disturbance.
Dark and without power for the j
morning were Encina, Branncr, Toy
on, and Dr. Wilbur's home. The,
trouble occurred when the circuit
breaker on the southeast aerial cablc
line, which runs by the Wilbur man
sion from the local sub station, blew
out about 7 o'clock this morning.
Trouble shooters found the break
on the 5,000-volt line which runs
underground in the alley back of j

Lasucn to President Wilbur's home.
The cable had been working with a
potential power of 400 to 500 volts; it
was about 20 years old. and the in
sulation was apparently insufficient,
causing the blow-out.
About noon service was restored to
the halls, but service to Lagunita
Knoll was not restored until late
evening. The entire Wilbur residence
was without electricity. After the
break was found, it was necessary to
splice in a new length of cable.
Service to the halls was out for
about six hours, disabling the Li
brary clocks which presented strange
times. Light finally came back to the
rough when the disconnects on the
main line were opened.
