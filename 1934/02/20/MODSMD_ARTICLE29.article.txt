### 
Famous Stanford Debater Bromley Smith, arguing that the press is not >
free, deciuioncd Famous Stanford Debater Abe Mellinkoff by a vote of :
26-21 in last night's Public Forum in Room 202 of the English Building.

* Limiting the question generally to j
"Resolved, that freedom of the press i
exists in this country," Chairman !
Frank Fullenwider introduced affir- i
mative Debater Mellinkoff.
Contending that freedom of the'
press meant freedom for the owner
to print what he pleased, Mellinkoff j
in his argument stated that the press '
was free, because newspaper own- !
ers only desired to make profits, and
no one interfered with that. To cx- i
tract the amount of profit they do- j
sired, they needed readers and ad- j
vertisers, according to MellinkofT.
He admitted that, of course, the '
publisher would not do anything to j
offend his advertisers, but that he j
was free to do that if he wanted to. '
In this connection, Mellinkoff stated ;
that if he wanted to sit on a thumb- \
tack no one could stop him.
With Mellinkoff wit, he continued !
with a statement, that as far as cam- j
pus journalism was concerned, it was j
free within certain limits, mention- j
ing the fact that the Daily was free :
to state that Rolph was an excuse for |
a governor, while the S.F. Examiner '
was free to state that the office of j
governor was an excuse for Rolph.
More seriously, Bromley Smith '
countered with the argument that j
the public should be the owner of the ;
press, that it should be a public util
ity of the highest order. Contending
that it now serves the interests of
the owner and the advertiser instead,
lie gave examples of the insidious
type of graft and subversive infiu- |
ences carried on by big business in j
metropolitan journalism.
Interested in the discussion, the j
audience mildly heckled speakers
and was encouraged by Fullenwider
to enter the discussion.
