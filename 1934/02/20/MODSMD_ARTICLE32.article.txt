# Educated Berkeley Rat Pride of Psychologists
## 
### 
BERKELEY, Feb. 18 (UP).â€”"Miss
Major," a rat with a college educa
tion, is the pride of the University of
California Psychology Department.
She has learned to jump out of an
enclosure onto an open table, drag
her tin plate of food to the edge of a
one-foot barrier, hold on by her tail
and hind feet, and with her teeth and
forefeet hoist up the tin of food. Then
as methodically she lowers it to tht*
other side of the barrier.
Nine generations of Grade A bright
rats, interbred over a period of seven
years, were used in perfecting "Miss
Major."
