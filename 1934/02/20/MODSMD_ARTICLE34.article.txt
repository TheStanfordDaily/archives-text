# PUBLIC WORKS PLANS LAUDED BY PROFESSOR

Simple governmental organization
with no overlapping, efficient mach
inery for better service, an economic
structure with fewer units and offi
cers, democratic control with full re
sponsibility for the people, are all
favored by Professor Edwin Angel I
Cottrell, who last night spoke on
Stanford's series of educational talks
presented over KPO.
Professor Cottrell believes that the
California legislature should evolve
a plan, possible under the present
government constitution, providing
for the gradual transfer of govern
ment functions from smaller to lar
ger units. It should authorize dis
organization of special districts or
their consolidation with county gov
ernments.
County Consolidation
Counties should take advantage of
such authorization to consolidate
their areas. Many of the present
small counties could consolidate and
still remain smaller in area, popula
tion, and assessed valuation than
some of the neighboring
Larger county units .should organize
under charters framed to meet pres
ent needs.
Special authorities might be or
ganized to care for certain functions
on a large scale, said Professor Cot
trell. Examples of such authorities
are given by the new Tennessee Val
ley Authority, the Port Authority in
New York and New Jersey, and the
Metropolitan Commission for water,
sewers, parks, and planning in Mas
sachusetts. State supervision should
be given to such activities as educa
tion, health, institutions, and affairs,
only excepting those within some
municipality.
Reduce Expense
The state, in Professor Cottrell':-.
opinion, could create areas for these
functions based on the ability to give
adequate .service for each activity, as
is done at present with school funds
and highway administration.
'"All of these proposals are in op
eration in some parts of the coun
try," said Professor Cottrell, "and
arc merely attempts to eliminate
Unnecessary governmental activities
which cause needless expense.
"Essentials should be preserved
but we must abolish decentralized
governments which do some neces
sary things badly and do many other
things which do not need to be done.
An area should be devised with fiscal
and operating controls, controls
which have made our municipalities
the best of our public instruments of
service."
Professor Cottrell believes thai
now is the time for Ihe people to
reconstruct their entire governmen
tal machinery upon well-tested mod
ern lines, creating simple, efficient,
economical, democratic, and respon
sive authorities of government.

governments which do some neces
sary things badly and do many other
things which do not need to be done.
An area should be devised with fiscal
and operating controls, controls
which have made our municipalities
the best of our public instruments of
service."
Professor Cottrell believes thai
now is the time for Ihe people to
reconstruct their entire governmen
tal machinery upon well-tested mod
ern lines, creating simple, efficient,
economical, democratic, and respon
sive authorities of government.

Montanans drank one-fifth of a
barrel of beer per capita person dur
ing Ihe first nine months of legal
sale, figures show.
Simple governmental organization
with no overlapping, efficient mach
inery for better service, an economic
structure with fewer units and offi
cers, democratic control with full re
sponsibility for the people, are all
favored by Professor Edwin Angel I
Cottrell, who last night spoke on
Stanford's series of educational talks
presented over KPO.
Professor Cottrell believes that the
California legislature should evolve
a plan, possible under the present
government constitution, providing
for the gradual transfer of govern
ment functions from smaller to lar
ger units. It should authorize dis
organization of special districts or
their consolidation with county gov
ernments.
County Consolidation
Counties should take advantage of
such authorization to consolidate
their areas. Many of the present
small counties could consolidate and
still remain smaller in area, popula
tion, and assessed valuation than
some of the neighboring
Larger county units .should organize
under charters framed to meet pres
ent needs.
Special authorities might be or
ganized to care for certain functions
on a large scale, said Professor Cot
trell. Examples of such authorities
are given by the new Tennessee Val
ley Authority, the Port Authority in
New York and New Jersey, and the
Metropolitan Commission for water,
sewers, parks, and planning in Mas
sachusetts. State supervision should
be given to such activities as educa
tion, health, institutions, and affairs,
only excepting those within some
municipality.
Reduce Expense
The state, in Professor Cottrell':-.
opinion, could create areas for these
functions based on the ability to give
adequate .service for each activity, as
is done at present with school funds
and highway administration.
'"All of these proposals are in op
eration in some parts of the coun
try," said Professor Cottrell, "and
arc merely attempts to eliminate
Unnecessary governmental activities
which cause needless expense.
"Essentials should be preserved
but we must abolish decentralized
governments which do some neces
sary things badly and do many other
things which do not need to be done.
An area should be devised with fiscal
and operating controls, controls
which have made our municipalities
the best of our public instruments of
