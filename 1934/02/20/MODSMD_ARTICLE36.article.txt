"Hack to the Farm," password and watchword for some
months, students hope will soon he resumed. The Masque
Hall is coming, an event of distinct interest lo the. Farm.
When the Convalescent Home drive rolls around again,
a resumption of the "Hack to the Farm" movement should
he in full swing.
With .'WO "imports" lo enhance Ihe former "500," the
original movement bids fair to succeed. What has become
of Ihe All -1 niversi I y dances which were put on by the
Rally Committee and sponsored by Ihe A.S.S.I'.? They
seem to he in temporary slumber. Since November the
campus hasn't heard of one. It's nice lo go dancing in Ihe
city, but il still lakes live gallons of gasoline lo get there
and hack.
We have a concert series which is interesting, educa
tional, and culturally valuable. It needs and deserves stu
dent support. Student dramatics is another field in which
Ihe "Hack to the Farm" idea lias been manifest.
This all adds up to a lot of activity, with much accom
panying student interest for the next few months. Un
doubtedly the movement will again come more promi
nently to student attention. With it should come a renewal
of all-I'niversity dances as often as possible, more student
participation in dramatics, a worthy concert series, and,
for spring quarter, Stanford's own charily, energetic sup
port of the Convalescent Home drive.
