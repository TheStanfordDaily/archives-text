# Heads We Shall Crown
## 
### 
Spring is coming along fairly rapidly now, bringing
balmy weather, junior water carnivals, cord balls, etc., and
the annual threat of plenty of sunshine during the week of
linal examinations. And then there is the Masque Hall.
The Masque Hall, we arc told, is really very, very much
fun. Everyone and his kid sister manage to buy a bid (be
fore they are completely sold out) and show up for the
gala event attired in any manner of costume available.
The large variety of original home-made costumes is a
popular feature.
Where there's a Masque Hall, there must be a King
and where there's a King, it follows that there shall be
a Queen. The Mascpie Hall is out to raise money, most
hopefully, for the children at the Convalescent Home.
Therefore, we have the annual King contest, at which time
the coffers of the rich are poured forth to place the most
available woman on the Row and her self-chosen spouse
jointly on the throne for the evening.
Kings and Queens are all right, in their proper place.
They are all right even at a Masque Rail. In fact, they are
quite entertaining at a Masque Hall. Hut if Stanford is
going to have a King and a Queen without dealing out a
full royal flush from a stacked deck, why not make the
choice on a basis of popularity instead of on the amount
of hard, cold cash in the cooler?
Rumor has it that the Rally Committee is considering a
combination of the two ideas, one that will serve the dual
purpose of raising sufficient funds and yielding a pair, of
monarchs of popular choice.
We look for a welcome change. April 20 is not so far
off, and there's a big kick in seeing what one can dig up
in the way of a King, Queen, or an unusual costume.
