## FRANCE COOLS OFF 
### CROMPTON BANGS Jr 
In the past few days, France's
troubles have nearly disappeared
from the front page. Now that com
parative calm has been restored, a
clearer picture of the who.le crisis
can be seen.
The troubles which came to a head
two weeks ago had been brewing for
months. On three main fronts vital
issues have been developing. If the
present "strong man" government
wants to stay in office for any length
of time, it will have to deal with
these issues.
France Had the Jitters
The crisis which flared out so vio
lently was largely a bad case of jit
ters. In the fields of economies, di
plomacy, and politics things had been
pretty topsy-turvy and uncertain for
a long time. As each succeeding cri
sis gave birth to a more serious one,
things began to get on the French
men's nerves. And when Frenchmen
get really peeved at the government,
watch out!
On the Economic Front
For some time all has not been
quiet on the economic front. France
has been faced with two problems:
(1) an internal attack on the budget,
and (2) an external attack on her
gold reserves. Frenchmen are pro
verbially opposed to high taxes, but
one man in every six works for the
government and refuses to have his
pay cut. The result has been a series
of deficits making ours look tame by
comparison <nti'. the New Dja!
came along.
French prosperity (1929 vintage)
was built on two things: selling lux
uries like perfume and stylish clothes
to us, and plenty of generous, spend

; thrift American tourists. But the
perfume and dress business is ter
rible now, and what tourists there
- are are awfully stingy.
So French finances are in bad
j shape; gold has been leaving the
country at an alarming rate. If
1 France has to go off the gold stand
| ard, the government will have to
face the wrath of the thrifty French
peasants whose hoarded savings
would be partially wiped out.
On (he Diplomatic Front
Meanwhile across the German
frontier, Hitler grew stronger and
; stronger, and looked more and more
like the Big Bad Wolf every day.
But the numerous Frcnch cabinets
[ just objected feebly, which made the
Frenchmen fighting mad.
.... and on the Political Front
| With such pressure from these two
directions, a demand for a strong
; government arose. Most Frenchmen
i were sick and tired of the hot air and
i petty political dirty work in the
Chamber of Deputiesâ€”which got the
country nowhere except in the red.
Two of France's most powerful
neighbors are Fascist countries. Most
Frenchmen do not. like the idea of
either German or Italian brand, but
many of them are really fascinated
by the results Hitler and Mussolini
have obtained. They would like the
results achieved without the neces
sary sacrifice of personal liberties.
French Socialists feared the govern
ment would go the whole way and go
Fascist, so they rioted. The Royalists
thought the government wouldn't, so
| they rioted. Now the Doumergue
strong-man cabinet is going to try
to settle things a la Roosevelt.
