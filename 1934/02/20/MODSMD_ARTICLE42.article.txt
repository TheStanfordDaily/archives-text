### RUGBY STILL REAL SPORT 
It was with great pleasure thai I
attended last Saturday's rugby game
between Stanford and Lane Hospital.
I was not sorry to find out that in
spite of the "revival" of the past two
years, there were still more people
on the playing field than in the
stands. The immense stadium was
ponderously silent; in the press box,
there were no telegraph operators to
disturb the quiet, for this sanctum
sanctorum was entirely empty. Dur
ing the half-time intermission, there
were neither card stunts nor any
substantial quantity of peanuts. The
public-address system maintained a
mute impartiality.
Rugby, fortunately, has no junior

I managers to "bounce" spectators who
come too close to the performers, nor
does it have very many of the other
, necessary evils which adorn the so
called "major sports."
The aim of the rugby coach, at
least at Stanford, is not so much to
pile up a large score, as to be sure
that all of Ihe men on his squad get
to play. Once during the second half
of Saturday's game, Harry Maloney,
the Stanford coach, turned to the
bench where several substitutes were
sitting. "Do any of you want to go
back in?" he asked. One or two of
i the substitutes accepted Ihe offer, in
' the manner in which it was tended:
without embarrassment. I could see

by the dirt on their faces and on
their uniforms that everyone had j
been given a chance to play—l could
not help recalling those long Salur- ;
day afternoons in autumn, when [
week after week playeVs who had :
been on freshman, gray, and varsity
football teams for three years, spent ■
the whole game on the bench.

I do not mean to condemn foot
| ball, or ask for a reversion in "major
] sports" to the athletic idealism of
I rugby. I think there is a place
i both types of sport.
But what is most to ho feared is a j
j conversion of rugby itself into a six- !
j practice-a-week, million-dollar gate j
j sport. There is a tendency in that
| direction: already rugby is beginning
j to reflect the hollow glare of sport
! ing page ballyhoo. One hears of in
| tersectional rugby matches, and even
i of intense interteam rivalries,
j Although lam heartily in favor of
j team trips to British Columbia and j
I Australia, I think it is important that j
j the players remember that the gomes |
J themselves are most of all for fun. j
| It should be the manifest effort of
j every rugby lover to see that the ul- 1
timate distinction between a sport for
\ players and a sport for spectators is l
1 maintained. It will be a sad day !
when rugby becomes money-making.
