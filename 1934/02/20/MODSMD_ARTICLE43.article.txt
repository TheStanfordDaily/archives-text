# CAMPUS OPINION
## THE 						DIP'S A DUPE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Congratulations!
One of your minions has achieved
1 the ultimate. He (or she) has at
' tained the supreme objective of the
newshounds— the making of news
from nothing! He (or she) has qual
| ified for whatever it is among re
porters that corresponds to the
I "Hole-in-One" club among golfers.
Again—Congratulations! But let
| me explain—
The Quad editor, on whose staff I
work, asked me to run an errand for
him. It was to get a letter from ihe
right-hand pocket of his car. But it
so happened that there were three
cars there exactly like his, in fact
i one was his.
I But it was my unfortunate case to
have to go through all three before
finding the letter. Evidently, .some
body saw me and turned my de
j scription into Gordy Davis.
When I arose the next morning
and picked up a Daily (the first, or
I perhaps second, thing that I do each
morning), I read of the blue-sweat
i ered "Campus Dip!" I blushed clear
! through my 8 o'clock.
To assist Gordy Davis, with whom
I —unfortunately—already possess a
j speeding acquaintance, I may say
' that I also have a brown sweafer.
* Yours,
The "Campus Dip"
; Because of space limitations yes
! terday, this letter could not be run.
i Hence the substitution of the signa
| ture. Hereafter all opinions must be
! signed.
