# M.-K.M. TO THE FORE
## 
### 
I The Editor, Sir:
I noted with great interest that in
• your very first editorial you spoke
| of the Daily as the "news organ" of
the Associated Students. This means
j to those, like myself, uninitiated into
: the mysteries of college'journalism,
| that the students of Stanford would
| be given campus news by the Stan
! ford Daily.
At first flush, this seemed not an
unwarranted deduction from your
statement. However, subsequent
events have proved that I was grossly
i in error.
I The subsequent events I refer to
! hinge around the editorship of the
j Daily, which you referred to as a
| news organ.
j I read one day that Dick Strouse
1 has been elected editor by a vote of
!26 to 19. This is understandable. The
! next day I read that Bob Letts is
; editor—not Dick Strouse, the man
| who was editor the day before. The

third day, I read that Letts is still
editor. This is not understandable.
It only seems fair to me that if
Strouse is editor on Wednesday,
Letts on Thursday—that Strouse be
made editor on Friday.
Where is the justice of letting one
man be editor two days and the other
man only one day?
I know that there is a great gov
ernmental complexity about the edi
torship that might explain this un
fair situation. The Daily mentioned
something about it.
I, and many interested students,
would like to know more. We want
all the news about the Daily editor
ship and the seeming injustice. An
organ that could play half a song is
no organ; and a news organ that
prints half of the news is no organ.
If this is just an error, Mr. Editor,
pardon my laughing altitude for er
rors are nothing to laugh about.
I hope, in anxiety, and in reliance
on your statement that the Daily is
a "news organ," I await the appear
ance of the full story.
Sincerely yours,
Mary-Katherine Morris, '34

The Daily handled the story com
pletely, Miss Morris.—Ed.
