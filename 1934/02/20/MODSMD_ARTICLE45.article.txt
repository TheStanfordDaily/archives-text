The Editor, Sir:
I've always hesitated to write a
campus opinion because they always
seem to fall back disastrously upon
oneself, but since this is a revolu
tionary age in which the opinions
are not put into the paper I thought
the time had come to talk on cab
bages and papers.
Where once I hesitated I am be
coming quite bold. Not only on Opin
ion but a request for the editorship

of the bally paper. Imagine that if
you can for outright nerve! But if
you only knewâ€”l can do the work.
I once was a newsboy; wrong, not
once, but three times. Anyway, I'd
like to have my name right there at
the top of the old second page, and
then be able to toss out all opinions
on how a few strong charactered
(the frosh probably still retain the
idea) ex committee members couldn't
say yes or no.
But couldn't you let me have the
job for a week, to let my folks have
time to congratulate me. Maybe you
better not. Others pay $114, and
maybe they would like a chance.
197, 198, 199, 200.
Respectfully yours,
