RUGBY AS IT IS
FOR LOCAL FANS
Rugby as it really is will be served
up to Stanford enthusiasts according
to the B.A.C.'s announcement that
an all-star team from British Colum
bia will play here March 1. Not that
the local players don't put on a good
.show, but it is natural that men who
have played the game for years
should display more finesse than
those whose experience, for the most
part, extends over a period of two
seasons.
Three games have been scheduled
definitely by the British Columbia
team, one of which will be played at
Stanford and the other two at Berk
eley and San Francisco. Backed by
Ihe British Columbia Rugby Union,
Ihe Canadian team will be made up
of players selected from clubs and
universities under its jurisdiction.
Three British Columbia teams de
feated the all-star aggregation of
Stanford and California players
which played in Canada during the
Christmas holidays while one team,
the University of British Columbia,
lost to the Americans. The ranks of
the Cardinals have been consider
ably strengthened since Ihen with
the addition of several grid stars.
RUGBY TAKES HOLD
IN COAST COLLEGES
Rugby, in the short period since its
revival here, has aroused a surpris
ing amount of interest among Pacific
Coast colleges. In addition to Stan
ford and California, San Francisco
University has taken it up in the
northern part of the state while U.S.
C., California Institute of Technol
ogy, U.C.L.A., and Pasadena Junior
College, among others, are playing
in Southern California. Incidentally,
it is said that Irvine Warburton, Tro
jan all-American, couldn't make the
rugby team, but his understudy in
American football, Bill Howard, is
one of the stars of U.S.C.'s 15.
