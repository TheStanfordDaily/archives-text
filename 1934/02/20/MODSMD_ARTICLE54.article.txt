# FROSH DIAMONDMEN MEET SEQUOIA HIGH
## 
### 
After showing very little promise j
against the San Francisco State j
Teachers College Saturday, Stanford I
freshmen baseball players will once j
again try to redeem themselves this j
afternoon when they meet Sequoia j
High School on the frosh field. The
game will start at 3:15 o'clock.
Errors, totaling nine, made a fair
battery and a weak hitting team '
look weaker Saturday.
A. Lanson Davis has shown good j
pitching form to. date. Ho has re- j
ceived fair support, and he teams
well with Mike Ferro, catcher.
After an erratic season start, the ;
Stanford outfield has settled down
considerably and- looks better in i
fielding flies. However, the infield is j
still Coach Ernie Nevers' chief prob- I
lem. He is still experimenting with j
combinations in this department, and '
may have a better group today.

Vifamines "B" and "G," essential j
to the growth of the young, are j
found principally in the germ and j
seed coat of whole grains.
