# FRESHMAN TRACKSTERS PREPARE FOR SATURDAY SAN MATEO MEET
## 
### 
j With but three days of actual prac
tice remaining, Coach Bill Ellington
intends to work his frosh track and
field proteges harder than ever in
preparation for their forthcoming
meet on Saturday with a powerful
San Mateo Junior College aggrega
tion. The contest will be the initial
, appearance of the 1934 season for the
' first-year cindermen, and according
to Ellington will be one of the tough
est encounters.
The San Mateo team is coached by
i Tex Byrd, former pupil of Elling
ton's, so a great deal of rivalry is an
; ticipated.

Coach Ellington has many good
prospects on his frosh roster but as
yet has not seen the boys under the
fire of meaningful competition and
the meet Saturday should help him
to get a definite line on his athletes.
At. the present time, the Babes are
hard pressed for pole vaulter, Wil
liamson being the only contestant
and he being rather heavy for the
event although he cleared 10 feet 6
inches last week.
With Chuck Voigt and.Fred Wil
liams, a couple of 9.8 men in the
dashes, the frosh should be well for
tified here.
