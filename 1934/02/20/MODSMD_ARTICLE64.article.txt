DINNER AT EIGHT (MGM)
At the Stanford Theatre
This film field-day presents almost
every star on the MGM 10l except
Norma Shearer and Clark Gable—
| and it almost seems a shame that
they didn't retain the original maid
and chauffeur roles of the play, in
order to feature these two perform
ers as well.
The appeal of "Dinner at Eight"
lies, perforce, in the names, and one
is thus more interested in the clever
j ness and the personalities of the per
; formers than in the tangled lives of
I the guests at Mrs. Oliver Jordan's
dinner. This is not as it should be,
but perhaps you prefer not to look a
gift cast in the mouth?
The adaptation is on the whole a
good one, the notable omission being
the excellent comic scene among the
I servants in the kitchen. The abrupt
ending of the stage version has been
eased over by the addition of a brief
finale in which the incidents are tied
into neat little dramatic bundles.
Though it may seem gratuitous to
some, the conclusion — particularly

j Marie Dressler's final line—is at least
in tone. For this portion, Donald
I Ogden Stewart's dialogue must be
[ commended.
| The play—as everyone must know !
by now—is another of the lately pop- j
ular cycle of yarns dealing with brief
incidents in the lives of a number of
characters—in this case, the dinner
guests.
Selecting the best performance is'
about like selecting an all-American !
football team: all will do it, and few I
will agree. Most reviewers accord
first honors to Jean Harlow, just I
why, I have been unable to discover, j
Her role of the ex-chorus-girl who
aspires to "high society" is simply a I
"natural" for her, and as such, she |
fills it deftly.
The most distinguished perform- i
ance of the film is given by Billie •
Burke, in the role of the hostess. It j
is an unwieldy part, and she imbues |
it with subtle and infinitely clever j
touches of characterization. Her eli- !
max scene, splendidly handled, is j
perhaps the highlight of the picture, j
Marie Dressier can do no wrong, |
and her interpretation of the retired j
actress who is "having her double j
chins in private," much aided by her i
lines, is a delightful one. With Miss,
i Harlow and Miss Dressier, com- f
! edy burden is shared by Wallace
Beery, who gives a fairly superficial j
handling to a superficial role.
The Brothers Barrymore overact
less than usual, but Lionel adheres
; steadfastly to all his mannerisms
I which he abandoned so happily in ,
j "Stranger's Return." Consistence is j
i the keynote of John's impersonation j
j of Larry Renault, and his perform- j
I ance is above reproach. Through a
i fault of the director, rather than of j
| the actor, Renault's suicide loses ef- j
fectiveness in its transition to the .
screen.
Lee Tracy's press agent is mod- !
oiled after the usual Tracy pattern, j
fortunately modified. Edmund Lowe
j and Karen Morley are capable in
colorless roles, while May Robson
and the late Louise Closser Hale are
delightful in all-too-bricf appear
ances. —Chapin

The most distinguished perform- i
ance of the film is given by Billie •
Burke, in the role of the hostess. It j
is an unwieldy part, and she imbues |
it with subtle and infinitely clever j
touches of characterization. Her eli- !
max scene, splendidly handled, is j
perhaps the highlight of the picture, j
Marie Dressier can do no wrong, |
and her interpretation of the retired j
actress who is "having her double j
chins in private," much aided by her i
lines, is a delightful one. With Miss,
i Harlow and Miss Dressier, com- f
! edy burden is shared by Wallace
Beery, who gives a fairly superficial j
handling to a superficial role.
The Brothers Barrymore overact
less than usual, but Lionel adheres
; steadfastly to all his mannerisms
I which he abandoned so happily in ,
j "Stranger's Return." Consistence is j
i the keynote of John's impersonation j
j of Larry Renault, and his perform- j
I ance is above reproach. Through a
i fault of the director, rather than of j
| the actor, Renault's suicide loses ef- j
fectiveness in its transition to the .
screen.
Lee Tracy's press agent is mod- !
oiled after the usual Tracy pattern, j
fortunately modified. Edmund Lowe
j and Karen Morley are capable in
colorless roles, while May Robson
and the late Louise Closser Hale are
delightful in all-too-bricf appear
ances. —Chapin
DINNER AT EIGHT (MGM)
At the Stanford Theatre
This film field-day presents almost
every star on the MGM 10l except
Norma Shearer and Clark Gable—
| and it almost seems a shame that
they didn't retain the original maid
and chauffeur roles of the play, in
order to feature these two perform
ers as well.
The appeal of "Dinner at Eight"
lies, perforce, in the names, and one
is thus more interested in the clever
j ness and the personalities of the per
; formers than in the tangled lives of
I the guests at Mrs. Oliver Jordan's
dinner. This is not as it should be,
but perhaps you prefer not to look a
gift cast in the mouth?
The adaptation is on the whole a
good one, the notable omission being
the excellent comic scene among the
I servants in the kitchen. The abrupt
ending of the stage version has been
eased over by the addition of a brief
finale in which the incidents are tied
into neat little dramatic bundles.
Though it may seem gratuitous to
some, the conclusion — particularly

j Marie Dressler's final line—is at least
in tone. For this portion, Donald
I Ogden Stewart's dialogue must be
[ commended.
| The play—as everyone must know !
by now—is another of the lately pop- j
ular cycle of yarns dealing with brief
incidents in the lives of a number of
characters—in this case, the dinner
guests.
Selecting the best performance is'
about like selecting an all-American !
football team: all will do it, and few I
will agree. Most reviewers accord
first honors to Jean Harlow, just I
why, I have been unable to discover, j
Her role of the ex-chorus-girl who
aspires to "high society" is simply a I
"natural" for her, and as such, she |
fills it deftly.
