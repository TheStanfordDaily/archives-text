# In Tribute to Dickens' Memory

A Philadelphia child placing a wreath on the statue of
Charles Dickens on the recent 122 nd anniversary of his birth,
almost coincident with the announcement by the Dickens fam
ily that a manuscript he wrote for his children in 1849 was
available for publication. Entitled "The Life of Our Lord," it
had been preserved as a family treasure until the recent death
of Sir Henry Fielding Dickens, last of the author's children.
