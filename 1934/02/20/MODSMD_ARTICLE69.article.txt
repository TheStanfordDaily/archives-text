# STORM OVER ASIA IN FIFTH REVIVAL BY ENGLISH CLUB
## 
### 
Featuring the Russian film, "Storm
j Over Asia," the English Club will
, present the fifth of its revivals of
j outstanding silent pictures in the
| Stanford Auditorium on Wednes
day evening, February 28.
"Storm Over Asia" is the acknowl
edged masterpiece of the director,
j Pudovkin, who by many critics is
| considered superior to the mueh
-1 publicized Eisenstein. The appear
ance of Anna Sten in its cast makes
| its presentation now particularly
timely.
Pudovkin is known for his pro
i duciions of Gorky's "Mother" and of
I "The End of St. Petersburg." His
j style, less mechanical than that of
; Eisenstein, calls for the suppression
: of theatricality, the symbolic use of
light, rythm, and objects, but subor
dinates technique to interest in story
I and characters.
