# TEAMSTERS STRIKE
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Feb. 19 (UP).â€”With
the city in the grip of a near zero
cold wave, a general strike of coal
teamsters today halted all deliveries
of coal. The strike was called so
suddenly that many union men
worked several hours before being
notified of the action. Drivers de
manded an eight-hour day and an
increase of 50 cents a day above their
present wage of $7.50.
