# FLYING GENERAL MAKES SURVEY OF AIR ROUTES
## Army Fliers Make Attempt To Carry on Schedule Of Private Lines WEATHER INTERVENES Airmail's Arrival in Newark Greeted With Cheers 
### 
CHICAGO, Feb. 20 (UP).—Briga
dier-General Oscar Westover him
self led the way in an open cockpit
over windswept airways today as an
example for United States Army
aviators who made their first airmail
flights in one of the greatest peace
time projects ever attempted by the
war forces of a nation.
While Army fliers were having
varying successes in their attempts
to carry the mail on schedule, the
Brigadier - General calmly stepped
into an open plane at Washington
and set out on a westward inspection
tour.
Westover is in command of the
Army forces which were called to
take over the airmail service on short
notice after all contracts held by pri
vate companies were cancelled.
"Carry On" Spirit
After more than 24 hours under
the new arrangement, one fact stood
out. It was simply that the Army is
carrying 'he mail to the best of its
ability despite bad weather in many
sections of the country.
Except for cheers that greeted
Lieut. Donald Wackwitz when he
landed with the first Army-trans
ported airmail cargo from Cleveland
to Newark, little fanfare accom
panied the attempts of the service
men to maintain fast schedules that
had been set by private companies.
Grounded by Weather
Because of bad weather, most of
the Army planes, as well as most
private planes, were kept on the
ground in Eastern states. Fog
grounded or turned back others in
the West. At Greenville, S.C., a
service ship piloted by Lieut. E. T.
Gorman nosed over in landing. Gor
man's cargo, undamaged, was sent
to Charlotte by train, then relayed
by another Army airplane.
Throughout the midwest, where
the weather was cold but the snow
storm had subsided, the mails went
through about on schedule. In the
far West and South, some mail went
on schedule and some didn't. One
ship turned back, on-; was stopped
because of fog; one trip was can
celled because of a low ceiling.
While the Army was battling cold,
fog, low ceilings, cross winds, and
snowdrifts, Senator Joseph C. O'Ma
homey of Wyoming predicted in a
Senate address that the airmail serv
ice soon would be given back to the
private companies.

dier-General Oscar Westover him
self led the way in an open cockpit
over windswept airways today as an
example for United States Army
aviators who made their first airmail
flights in one of the greatest peace
time projects ever attempted by the
war forces of a nation.
While Army fliers were having
varying successes in their attempts
to carry the mail on schedule, the
Brigadier - General calmly stepped
into an open plane at Washington
and set out on a westward inspection
tour.
Westover is in command of the
Army forces which were called to
take over the airmail service on short
notice after all contracts held by pri
vate companies were cancelled.
"Carry On" Spirit
After more than 24 hours under
the new arrangement, one fact stood
out. It was simply that the Army is
carrying 'he mail to the best of its
ability despite bad weather in many
sections of the country.
Except for cheers that greeted
Lieut. Donald Wackwitz when he
landed with the first Army-trans
ported airmail cargo from Cleveland
to Newark, little fanfare accom
panied the attempts of the service
men to maintain fast schedules that
had been set by private companies.
Grounded by Weather
Because of bad weather, most of
the Army planes, as well as most
private planes, were kept on the
ground in Eastern states. Fog
grounded or turned back others in
the West. At Greenville, S.C., a
service ship piloted by Lieut. E. T.
Gorman nosed over in landing. Gor
man's cargo, undamaged, was sent
to Charlotte by train, then relayed
by another Army airplane.
Throughout the midwest, where
the weather was cold but the snow
storm had subsided, the mails went
through about on schedule. In the
far West and South, some mail went
on schedule and some didn't. One
ship turned back, on-; was stopped
because of fog; one trip was can
celled because of a low ceiling.
While the Army was battling cold,
fog, low ceilings, cross winds, and
snowdrifts, Senator Joseph C. O'Ma
homey of Wyoming predicted in a
Senate address that the airmail serv
ice soon would be given back to the
private companies.
