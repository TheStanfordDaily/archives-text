# DAILY CONTINUES TRYOUTS PERIOD
## 
### 
There is still time for students to
start trying out for the Stanford
Daily, according to Women's Editor
Ellamae Dodds, who is conducting
the mid-year tryout period. The pe
riod started Monday and will con
tinue until the end of next week.
Students who did not appear at the
first tryout meeting Monday are
asked to appear at one of the regu
lar tryout meetings that will be held
at 5 and 7 o'clock tonight in the
journalism library of the Press
Building. There will be two meet
ings so that those unable to attend
at one of the times can appear at
the other.
Next assignment for tryoutees will
be the reporting of the fairy tale of
"Cinderella and Her Fella" as a news
story. Students who will be away
over the Washington Birthday holi
day will not have their stories due
until Monday. Others are asked to
have their articles in Friday.
Keeping an accurate check on the
amount and kind of work reporters
are doing, Women's Editor Dodds
will make the first cut early next
week. Tryoutees surviving the cut
at the end of the two weeks' period
will attain the rank of reporters.
