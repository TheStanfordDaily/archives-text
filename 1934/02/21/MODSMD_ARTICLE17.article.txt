# SEQUOIA A NURSERY! Roble Renamed 'Rabble' JUST CAMPUS MIXUPS
## 
### 
Sequoia, well - known stronghold
of the Stanford rough, and that or
derly abode of the demure "800,"
Roble Hall, are no longer the places
they used to be if the.se two conver
sations are indicative.
In search of the campus gardner,
recently, a student called the Ad
ministration Building and asked the
operator to connect him with the
nursery.
"Pardon me," she replied, "did you
say Sequoia?"
Not to be outdone, a truck driver
delivering mayonnaise to Roble
salad-eaters yesterday drew up be
fore the sandstone walls of Encina
and asked the atsonished inmates to
direct him to "Hubble" llull.
