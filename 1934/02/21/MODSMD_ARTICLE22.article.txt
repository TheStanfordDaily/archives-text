# 'POWDER BOX' COMPLEXITIES BALK PEACE
## Dr. Christine Galitzi Talks On Difficulties Of Unification Plan 
### Will Williams 
Volatile and alert Dr. Christine
Galitzi, of Greece, France, and Rou
mania, spoke at some length on the
complexities of the Balkan peace sit
uation to a Tuesday evening As
sembly Hall audience.
Tracing the early origins of the
Balkan peoples, the effects of the
Slavonic and Magyar invasions upon
the culture of a country largely in
fluenced by Roman settlers, Dr. Ga
litzi pointed out the circumstances
which have been responsible for
most of the past disagreement in the
"Powder Box."
Nazis Propagate
Since the very earliest days, the
major powers have been seeking to
gain entrance into and exert power
over the many small Balkan states.
Even now they are not only faced
with Nazi propaganda and the idea
of Pan - Germanic or Pan - Nordic
milleniums, but On the left with
Mussolini's notions of Italian Fas
cism and on the right (geographi
cally) with the tentative growling of
the Russian Bear.
The tension is somewhat lessened
by recent affirmations of peaceable
motives and the non-aggression pacts
which have been signed. Also, there
is the fact that there is prevalent
among the Balkan peoples a high
courage and high idealism. Neither
does Dr. Galitzi fear dictatorship.
Indeed, she seriously doubts whether
there is a man of the talent and
strength and idealism necessary for
such a position.
Problems too Many
There is such a man in Albaniaâ€”
King Zog; there is such a man in
Greece in the person ol Venizelos,
and such a man in Mustapha Ketnal
Pascha of Turkey; but the Balkan
States arc too many and too small
successfully to be united, their cus
toms and languages too varying.
The Balkan States have long ad- j
hered to the ideals of the League oi i
Nations, because the idea represents [
a long held dream of unification. In j
her closing words, Galitzi said: "We j
do not need hope to build, nor sue- (
cess to persevere." Surprising her |
audience by being neither Gypsy nor |
fortune-teller, Dr. Galitzi did welt
at prophecy, charmed her audience, '
and won loud applause.
