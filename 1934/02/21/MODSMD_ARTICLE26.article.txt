## 
### CHARLOTTE BURRIDGE 
"It was one of the wonderful ex
periences of my life," said Kathleen
Norris, one of America's most popu
lar woman novelists, in telling of her
recent travels to Europe and the
Orient.
"It was my first trip," remarked
the charming gray-haired writer,
"and it was most interesting. It gives
you things you can't get out of
books," she added."
"A trip like that makes you ap
preciate not only the other countries
but also our own," said the veteran
author gazing about her lovely home
as though enjoying the comparison
with foreign dwellings.
"When I came back, I realized
what a wonderful country we have
and our responsibility to other na
tions. They depend so much on the
things we do," Mrs. Norris explained.
The traveler found Italy "clean and
beautiful"; and France "a bit upset."
England proved "most enjoyable,"
and Germany "quite thrilling." A

! 10-minute talk with Hitler was
among the notable experiences of the
visit. The Maharajah of Bogata, who
traveled on the same boat with the
Norris party, was another fascinating
character met by the author.
"Everyone was in London when
we were there: Douglas Fairbanks,
Jr., and Sr., Noel Coward, and Con
stance Collier. We often saw Hugh
Walpole at the Savoy," she remi
' nisced.
All of Kathleen Norris' previous
| stories luive been written both in and
| about America except part of one
with a setting in Sicily. "Beauty's
Daughter," the novel written during
: the trip, claims England, France,
Germany, Italy, and China as its
! birthplaces.
"I took my typewriter along and
worked all the time," the famous
story writer explained. "It wasn't
| hard to concentrate. Ive done it for
so many years. I always work from
, 9 to 12 o clock in the morning," she
1 added.
