Dignified, a us t c re, George
Washington was rarely treated
with familiarity by anyone, and
the tale of the man who slapped
the President on the hack is a
matter of legend.
Gouvcrneur Morris, at the
Constitutional Convention.
where Washington also was a
delegate, was asserting his sense
of equality to any man to some
friends, and was challenged by
Alexander Hamilton to display
familiarity with Washington,
the wager being wine and din
ner for the company.
Morris, accepting the chal
lenge, walked up to Washington
and slapped him on the shoul
der. No outburst was forthcom
ing, but Morris declared that
the look he received made it the
most dearly won wager of his
life.
