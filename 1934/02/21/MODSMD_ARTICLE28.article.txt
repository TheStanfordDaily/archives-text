Getting away at once to a good start,
Card varsity debaters won the ini

California tour yesterday noon at
Bakersfield before the City Exchange

the following succinct wire announc
ing the news: "Bright and Bold took
judges decision from Bakersfield."
The victorious Farm orators, Cap
tain Fred Bold and Andrew Bright,
upheld the affirmative of the ques
tion: "Resolved, That the powers of
the President should be substantially
increased as a settled policy" against
Bakersfield Junior College. The
roster of the Bakersfield City Ex
change Club is made up of prominent
business and professional men of the
vicinity.
Coach Lee Chapin yesterday an
nounced that after a conference Sat
urday with Debate Coach Sanford
Goldner of University of California,
it was decided that the subject for
the annual "Joffre Mediiille" classic,
to be held in the early spring, would
be: "France and Socialism." This is
the outstanding forensic event of the 5
year and Chapin urges all interested
in forthcoming tryouts 1o undertake
work immediately.
After the preliminary tryouts, six
men will be chosen for the Stanford
Joffre Squad, from whom three will
be finally selected to represent the
school. Last year Stanford won all
first three of the places in this con
