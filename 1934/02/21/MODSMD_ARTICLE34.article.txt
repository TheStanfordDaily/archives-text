# CHARITY BEGINS AT HOME
## 
### 
II lnusl have wanned the cockles of many campus
hearts Monday when (lie announcement was made that the
administration is undertaking a definite drive to assist
those unfortunate students who have been unable to
finance their way through school.
Through Convalescent Home drives, charity teas, and
benefit affairs, Stanford has punched holes in its pocket
books a good many times. Once again the time has come
to assist not only those who will be here in the future, but
those who are here now and who, in more than one case,
are not exactly sure where next week's meals are coming
from.
The campus, in recognizing the humanitarian move of
the Hoard of Trustees, could make no finer gesture than
to take in its hands the initiation of the drive by being
first on the list of contributors.
