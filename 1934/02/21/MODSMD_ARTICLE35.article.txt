# The 						Theatre Primer

### 
Stan-ford lias niaii-v nice build-ings. One build-ing is
known as the Great Big Morn. It is some-times thought of
as an Assem-blv Hall. Stan-ford students sit in treach
erous drafts on hard seats to watch excellent performances
that al-most make one forget how much it hurts to sit 011
those gosh-awful slabs of wood. Even in kin-der-gar-teu
we knew what it was like to plav in a (ireat Big Barn.
Barns have bats and things.
In a very el-e-mentarv fashion, we are raising a vcr-y
serious issue. II is one upon which action must be taken
soon. Be-fore, however, the Daily at-tempts to insti-gate
any serious noise on the sub-jeel of a New Theatre for
Stan-ford, a short word of warn-ing to an-y and all con
cerned may be in or-der.
Last year, an intcn-sive campaign was initi-ated with
the an-nounced pur-pose of actu-allv getting a brand new,
bigger and better the-a-tre for Stan-ford. If that time is
ev-er to come at all, it is due now. #
We raise an issue. The Stan-ford Board of Trus-tees
is an honor-able and wor-thy body. They have the inter
ests of the rniversity al heart. So have we. Stan-ford
needs a the-a-tre. There is an excel-lenl War Memorial
fund avail-able that sings a song in the neigh-bor-hood of
one hundred and fif-tv thousand dol-lars just now. We
would like a Me-mo-rial The-a-tre.
The question as stated today is vcr-y sim-plc. There is
ani-ple room for campus comment. Inlerest-ed par-lies
are in-vited to ex-press their ideas on the sub-jcct through
the cam-pus opin-ion column. Most Stan-ford boys and
gir-ruls would apprcci-ate their Board of Trus-tees pro
viding some-thing worthy of the name Stan-ford before
Pal-o Al-to grabs off all of Stan-ford's dramatic tal-ent.
Warn-ing is served. This is 110 idle i-dea. Stanford
needs a new the-a-tre. The Daily is go-ing to do its level
best to find some means of getting that the-a-tre. If anyone
lms an-y ideas, let him communi-cate with the Daily at
once.
Lest anyone have any doubts as to Ihe sub-jcct of this
cdi-torial: Stanford needs a theatre!

soon. Be-fore, however, the Daily at-tempts to insti-gate
any serious noise on the sub-jeel of a New Theatre for
Stan-ford, a short word of warn-ing to an-y and all con
cerned may be in or-der.
Last year, an intcn-sive campaign was initi-ated with
the an-nounced pur-pose of actu-allv getting a brand new,
bigger and better the-a-tre for Stan-ford. If that time is
ev-er to come at all, it is due now. #
We raise an issue. The Stan-ford Board of Trus-tees
is an honor-able and wor-thy body. They have the inter
ests of the rniversity al heart. So have we. Stan-ford
needs a the-a-tre. There is an excel-lenl War Memorial
fund avail-able that sings a song in the neigh-bor-hood of
one hundred and fif-tv thousand dol-lars just now. We
would like a Me-mo-rial The-a-tre.
The question as stated today is vcr-y sim-plc. There is
ani-ple room for campus comment. Inlerest-ed par-lies
are in-vited to ex-press their ideas on the sub-jcct through
the cam-pus opin-ion column. Most Stan-ford boys and
gir-ruls would apprcci-ate their Board of Trus-tees pro
viding some-thing worthy of the name Stan-ford before
Pal-o Al-to grabs off all of Stan-ford's dramatic tal-ent.
Warn-ing is served. This is 110 idle i-dea. Stanford
needs a new the-a-tre. The Daily is go-ing to do its level
best to find some means of getting that the-a-tre. If anyone
lms an-y ideas, let him communi-cate with the Daily at
once.
Lest anyone have any doubts as to Ihe sub-jcct of this
cdi-torial: Stanford needs a theatre!
Stan-ford lias niaii-v nice build-ings. One build-ing is
known as the Great Big Morn. It is some-times thought of
as an Assem-blv Hall. Stan-ford students sit in treach
erous drafts on hard seats to watch excellent performances
that al-most make one forget how much it hurts to sit 011
those gosh-awful slabs of wood. Even in kin-der-gar-teu
we knew what it was like to plav in a (ireat Big Barn.
Barns have bats and things.
In a very el-e-mentarv fashion, we are raising a vcr-y
serious issue. II is one upon which action must be taken
soon. Be-fore, however, the Daily at-tempts to insti-gate
any serious noise on the sub-jeel of a New Theatre for
