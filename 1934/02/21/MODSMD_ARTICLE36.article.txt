"Hide, brother?"
1 n front of the Quad, or at the "humming station" by
the Paly tracks, the Stanford rough stands, waiting for his
more fortunate friend to give him a lift into Palo Alio or
back to the Farm.
Of late, some of the roughs have been standing and

Maybe those of us who have been here longer are the
forgetful ones.
Anyway, it's worthy of a moment's thought to stop your
1918 phaeton or your 1!K>1 convertible and give somebody
a lift. You won't lose any time by it, because you'd only
be wailing for Ihe light at the highway to turn green.
