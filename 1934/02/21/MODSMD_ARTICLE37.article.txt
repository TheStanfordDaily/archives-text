Few and far between are the days when Leland Stan
ford Jr. t'nivcrsilv officials deem it fitting that eurriculnr
activities should be suspended for even so insignificant a
period as twenty-four hours. Tomorrow is the only one of
its kind until next Thanksgiving, save July Fourth in sum
mer quarter.
Let us petition old Jupiter Pluvius himself that Ihe rain
clouds take it easy tomorrow. Hlossoin lime is fast ap
proaching, and Ihe country-side is green. California sun
shine, we are coming. For additional information, contact
vour chamber of commerce or Ihe nearest travel agency.
