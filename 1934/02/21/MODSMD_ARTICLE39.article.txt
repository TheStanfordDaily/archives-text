# REBATE OR CAFETERIA?

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Might I suggest that a service could
be performed by the Daily were it
to concern itself with the Encina Din
ing Commons? Here there is consid
erable scope for improvement.
Freshmen are required, during
their first three quarters, to eat in
the Commons. They pay $86 for the
privilege, which is an expensive one.
When allowing for the refund, this
comes to about $1.05 a day, whether
or not the meals are attended.
I, together with a number of stu
dents. consider the system very poor
economy. Owing to the fixed and
limited times for meals it is often
impossible to get to them, and if one
goes away on a week-end vacation
one wastes several dollars worth of
tickets. One can eat when and what
one likes in Palo Alto for the same
cost per diem, and the town restau
rants are run on a profit basis and
have to pay rates and rents; how is it
then that the University is only able
to offer such poor quality food when
enjoying so many comparative ad
vantages?
Would it not be possible to have a
cafeteria system? Students could
buy tickets and receive refunds on
the unused ones. It would be possi
ble to spread out the time of serving
meals, and no longer would it be
necessary to get up at 7 o'clock for
breakfast.
We could have an alternative of
fare, and would no longer be forced
to eat and spend abroad. Although
the cost of operating a cafeteria
would be slightly greater, there
would be a net gain to the students
for they would no longer have to pay
twice for their meals.
