# GLAD YOU LIKE IT

The Editor, Sir:
Perhaps it is the general thing to
criticize. Certainly you get your
share in your newly elected, but not
quite clear capacity as editor of our
"Free from Politics" Stanford Daily.
But no matter who is wrong or
whatever is screwy—
"Upon the king! Let us our lives,
Our debts, our careful wives,
Our children and our sins, lay on
the king!"
This is your post from now on so
ably pointed out by Mellinkoff in his
farewell editorial message to Dick
Strouse—which was really meant
for you. As all the other mysteriously
elected past editors of this, our famed
journal and more vitally, our student
section of blasphemy, you are going
to be blamed for everything. It is
not, however, my purpose here to
criticize.
There are plenty taking care of
that, and while they send sizzling
letters of irritation at the general
existence of things and particularly
how you run this paper and got this
way, permit me to pass a word of
commendation on a new feature in
the Daily. I refer to the "Why It's
News" section by Crompton Bangs,
Jr. It's the kind of news we have
been wanting for a long time. Good
work, Mr. Bangs! We want more!
