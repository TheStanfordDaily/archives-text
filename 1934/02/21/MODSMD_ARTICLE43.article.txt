BERKELEY SQUARE (Fox)
At the Varsity Theatre
Like many another recent film,
"Berkeley Square" will prove emi
nently satisfactory to one who has
not seen the stage version, and
slightly disconcerting to one who
has.
It will be granted by most that the
story is based on a fundamentally
doubtful (to say the least) idea: that
all time is one, and that a man may
step back into the habit of an 18th
century ancestor and live that gen
tleman's life for him. By the very
intimacy of the medium of the screen,
the cinematic version serves to em
phasis the basic absurdity of the
idea, whei-eas the play was able
somewhat to gloss over this point.
Another shift in emphasis is found
in the fact that the screen version
magnifies the anachronisms and
even inserts additional ones—notably
the one about Mrs. Siddons — all
pointed for laughs. Where the screen
emphasizes the humor, ihe stage ver
sion stressed the romance between
Peter Standish and Helen Pettigrew
and made of it an infinitely tender

and touching affair—which it to an
extent remains on the screen —so that
the conclusion was almost tragic in
its emotional quality.
This does not mean, however, that
"Berkeley Square" is not distinctly
an above-average film; it is in truth
a beautifully made picture, and much
credit is due Director Frank Lloyd.
Leslie Howard brings to the pic
ture the same fine Peter Standish he
played on the stage, and his work is
made, if possible, even more con
vincing through the use of closeups.
Heather Angel is a pleasing hero
ine, and the remainder of the cast is
all splendid. —Chapin
