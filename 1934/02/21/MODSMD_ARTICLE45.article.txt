# WHY IT'S NEWS
## WAR TALK â€”DOES IT MEAN ANYTHING? 
### CROMPTON BANGS Jr 
For the past year in Europe, things j
! have been drifting from one crisis to ,
another. Yesterday brought a bigger
and better one. In Munich, Ger
many (just a short distance from
Austria), exiled Nazis threw down
the gauntlet to Austrian Chancellor
Dollfuss. Their leader, Theodore
Hablicht, gave the Austrians a week
to take the Nazis into the govern
ment. If Dollfuss refuses, he will
face a fight even more bloody than
last week's Socialist uprising. Does
this mean war? The answer is
probably not. But let's see what the
big frogs in the pond think about it.
In Germany
Now nobody doubts that Hitlei
means business; he has plenty of
nerve, but he is also clever. He is
naturally backing the Austrian Nazis
in their efforts to bring the country
under his domination. It took nerve
to stick to his guns in the face of a
united front by England, France, and
Italy against his policies. But Hitler
i is clever enough to know that the
! appearance of Austrian independence
J can be maintained if the Nazis worm
! their way into the government.
Speeches by Nazi fire-eaters sound
; pretty war-like, but just remember
i that they are for home consumption.
Most of them know that Germany is
not ready for war. II would bring
I plain suicide. Five years from now,
1 it might be different.
In Italy '
At first, Mussolini leaned toward
Hitler; he wanted the Versailles
Treaty revised, too. But when the
j Nazis began to talk of union with
Austria, Italy saw red and withdrew
! its support. As much as Mussolini
would like to trim France, she looks
much safer than Germany for the
time being. The result has been that
Mussolini is the biggest guarantee of
! peace in Europe today.
In Franco
France doesn't want war. If one
started, she would be one ol the first
drawn in. Naturally, she will try to
prevent war at almost any cost,
j Frenchmen are not really belliger
! ent; they are peaceful and home
loving. Before reducing the size of
; their army, they want two things: i
(1) security against invasion; (2) a
j peaceful Germany.
Most Frenchmen know they can
not get these things by working
alone. They are now trying desper
ately hard to get them by working
with England and Italy. There are a
I few people in France who believe the

best way to settle all this is to beat
up Germany now before she can get
any bigger. They are a hopeless mi
nority.
.... and in England
Although on the sidelines, England
would certainly drift into war if
somebody else started it. A couple
of years ago, England felt more pro-
German than pro-French. But Hit
ler changed their minds. It looks js
if they will stick with France and
Italy for the time being.
War Unlikely
It looks like the best way to keep
the boys from fighting is for France,
Italy, and England to team up and
scowl viciously at Germany. As long
as this keep up, chances for a war in
Europe are very slim. Maybe this
Mussolini is a good influence after
all.
