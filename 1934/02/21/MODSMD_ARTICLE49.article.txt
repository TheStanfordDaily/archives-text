## 
### 
Embryo Stanford track stars make
their initial bow in the garb of the
Indian Saturday when the frosh meet
San Mateo Junior College on Angeil
Field. While refusing to emulate
"Brick" Morse and toot the horns of
some of the better known individ
uals, we understand that Bill Elling
ton has several athletes who have
already recorded outstanding per
formances this season.
The varsity track situation, while
possibly not so encouraging as that
of a year ago, still looks good enough
to give Dean Cromwell and Brutus
Hamilton some sleepless nights.
Strength concentrated in the weights,
hurdles, javelin, pole vault, and
broad jump should account for most
of the Indian points, according to
present indications. The biggest
problem is to find enouc?,h second and
third place strength in the other
events to provide a margin of vic
tory.
