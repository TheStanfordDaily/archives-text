## 
### 
The varsity baseball team will face
the Kenealy Seals at 3:15 o'clock to
day on the Sunken diamond in a re
turn engagement. The Seals seek
revenge over the Stanford basebai
lers who last week showed little re
spect for the older and supposedly
■superior big leaguers when they took
Neal Kenealy's outfit by a decisive
6 to 3 score.
Pending official sanction of the
8.A.C., two other games have been
lined up for Saturday and next week
with a possibility that a third will be
scheduled for tomorrow. 4
Coach Harry Wolter tried to ar
range a game with the Mission Rook
ies for Washington's Birthday but
unfortunately the Rookies had a con
flict and could not fill the date. There i
is still a possibility that a meeting j
date can be agreed upon sometime I
next week.
Coach Wolter will start Stan An- ;
derson on the mound tomorrow, !
holding "Lefty" Campbell in reserve. |
Campbell will probably work the
last four innings. The same team
that has started the last three games
will again win the call tomorrow j
with numerous substitution likely as
the contest wears on.
The Seals lineup is unknown. It
is anticipated, however, that a strong !
cutfit will be collected.
