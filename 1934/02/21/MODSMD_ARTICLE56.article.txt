## 
### 
After having cinched the Northern
California Water Polo title, Stanford
water poloists wiir attempt to estab
lish claim to the Pacific Coast Inter
collegiate championship Saturday
when they meet California in the
Encina pool.
Roth varsity and freshman teams
will engage the Bears, with the
preliminary frosh contest sched
uled for 3:30 o'clock, and the var
sity encounter following at 4:15
o'clock.
California is conceded to have the
best team in years; Coach Nort
Thornton's Indians were pressed to
the limit in November when Vlad
Taranik scored the winning goal in
the closing 10 seconds of play.
The Bears have been steadily im
px-oving since the last Stanford-C-d
clash, and the game promises to be
as exciting as was the first. Califor
nia ha's never won from Cardinal
â– waiter poloists.
Saturday's games will be the last,
of the season for Stanford. Captain
Gordy Graves, all-Coast guard, will
play his last game for the Indians.
Jim Triolo will start at the Stan
ford sprint post, with Boh Foster
and Jim Benet playing in the for
ward positions.
Bill Woodai'd will appear at center
back, while Taranik will team with
Graves in the guard duties. Leo
Cook is slated for work in the goal.
For California, Ed Davis and Boyn
ton Kaiser are offensive leaders,
while Jack Dozier, Tom Smithson,
and Bill Johnson handle the bulk of
the defense.
With 13 straight victories to their
credit, Cardinal frosh are favored to
win from California again. However,
the Bear Cubs, boasting a real of
fensive threat in Danny Kuhns,
should press the Indian Babes
throughout. Stanford eked out a 5-4
victory ir. the November engage
ment, after trailing 3-1 at the inter

' mission. Kuhns scored all four Bear
goals.
Varsity Divers Tom Boothe and
Milt Friedman will give an exhibi
| tion between the games Saturday.
Women are invited to the games; a
small admission fee will be charged.
