# GOLFERS LEAVE FOR DEL MONTE
## 
### 
When the Stanford golf team leaves
(his afternoon to defend their Cali
fornia intercollegiate championship
tit Del Monte's Pebble Beach course,
they will he represented by at least
15 men. The present title, holder,
Stanford's Walker Cup man, Law
son Little, is doubtful whether he
will defend his title.
But even if he drops out of the race
there will be a formidable team there
to attempt to keep the title on the
Farm. At the present time this year's
edition of the varsity is considered
the best balanced in the eight years
that golf has been a minor sport on
the campus.
Should Little be absent the team
will be led into the fray by Jack
Hoerner, the longest driver and num
ber 2 man on the team. Jack is hit
ting his shots better than ho has ever,
but seems to have some difficulty in
stroking putts.
Disputing Hoerner's leadership,
Don Edwards will make his usual
attempt to upset ihe field. Dick Gid
dings, Bob Thompson, and Tom
Dwyer are all in good shape.
The other men entering the tour
nament under the Cardinal colors
are: Morse Erskine, Dan Moser, Bill
Hoelle, Hugh Mellon, Jack "Wigy"
Cox, Ray Gehan, Warren Munro,
Ray Hornby, and Bud Nichols.
Freshmen entering in their divi
sion are George Kuklinski, George
Berkey, Howard Clark, and Dal ton
Henderson.
