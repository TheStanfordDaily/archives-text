# INDIANS CLOSE HOOP SCHEDULE WITH U.C. GAME
## California Must Win Both Games to Tie Lead For Conference 
### 
Closing the hoop season, at least
as far as Stanford is concerned, the
Indians meet California in a two
game series tonight and tomorrow
night. The first game will be played
in the Bears' gymnasium and tomor
row's in the Stanford Pavilion.
California is faced with the neces
sity of winning both games to stay
in the running for the southern di
vision championship. The Bears are
now tied for the lead with U.S.C.,
who meets U.C.L.A. in two games in
Los Angeles which the Trojans
should be able to win with ease un
less the Bruins are in the same ugly
mood in which California found them
last Saturday, when they were upset
by the Uelans.
Stanford Injuries ,
Stanford, with at least half of its
hospital list back in the game if not
in the best of condition due to in
juries, may be able to turn back the
Bears in at least one game, although
all indications favor California. Keith
Topping, broken nose, face guard
and all, will be ready for action, but
Gordy Mallatratt is still out.
After being forced out of the U.C.
L.A. series two weeks ago with in
juries, Topping came back last week
against the Trojans to put up a good
game. His presence, if he is right,
will be a big aid to Stanford, but the
Bears have always proved to be his
nemesis.
Edelen's Last Game
Captain Hal Edelen will open at
center in the final appearance of his
Stanford career. One of the smooth
est floor men in the conference, Ede
len's play, while not spectacular,, has
been a highlight of the Indians' game.
Arne Anderson will probably open
at the other forward with Charley
Rogers and A1 Page at guards. Wytze
Gorter and Emil Cowing will no
doubt see action at the forward posts
as will Robin Lindsey at guard.
Eifert Problem
Stanford's biggest problem, as it
has been for the past two years, will
be to find an effective way to stop
Hal Eifert, California's high scoring
captain. Eifert leads the conference
scorers, well ahead of his nearest ri
val, Lee Guttcro of U.S.C.
With a great advantage in height
at center, California will control the
tip-off, and a large share of Stan
ford's success will depend on how
often they can break up the Bears'
tip-off plays.
In addition to Eifert at forward,
California will probably open with
Coughlan or Englehard at the other
forward, Meek, center, and Kenny
McGaffey, guards.
