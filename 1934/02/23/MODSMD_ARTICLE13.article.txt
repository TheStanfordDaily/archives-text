# Women Meet Cal Orators
## 
### 
Two of Stanford's argumentative
"800" journeyed to Berkeley Wed
nesday evening and matched their
j verbal gifts against those of Univer
sity of California co-eds. It was the
first forensic encounter that Stan
ford women have had with Califor
i nia this year.
Stanford upheld the negative side
of the question, "Resolved: That the
only alternative to Fascism in the
United States is the election of a
Socialist party," and its "debater
esses" were Marie-Louise Bine and
Mary Eichclberger.
Two well - known California de
baters, Dorothy Goldeen and Lois-
Ray Nichols, maintained the affir
mative position for the Berkeley in
stitution. Both of the Card women
were experienced, but as the con
test was of the Oregon no-decision
type, no official winner was pro
nounced. Each constructive speech
was of 12 minutes' length, followed
by rebuttals of 5 minutes' duration.
The debate was held in the U.C.
Women's Clubhouse, and was sup
ported by a good-sized crowd in
spite of its being the eve of the
i Washington's Birthday holiday. San
ford Goldner, Bear debate coach,
was present with many of the U.C.
varsity debate squad.

Fewer ailments of Parisians are
the result of wine-drinking, accord
ing to doctors whose practices are
diminishing.
