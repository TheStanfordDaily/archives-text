# Library's Camera Aids In Copying Documents
## 
### 
A means for obtaining facsimile
reproductions of what might be con
sidered otherwise unobtainable doc
uments at. a negligible cost exists
through the office of Dr. Nathan
Van Patten, head of Ihe Stanford
Library. This "service" is carried
on in conjunction and co-operation
with other large libraries in the
United States and abroad.
Movie-film strips, each individual
photograph of which contains a de
veloped miniature negative im
pression of the page of some rare
manuscript, historic document, out
of-print book, or early newspaper
1 editions, are placed in an electri
' cally operated stcreopticon projector
in a darkened room, and through an
adjustable lens the image is thrown
on the screen, reproducing the exact
text of the material.
Political science and history stu
dents will find this ingenious device
of considerable benefit in many in-

J stances. Dr. Maxwell Savelle of the >
' History Department, who at present |
is engaged in research in the field
of the American colonial era, is us
j ing this machine extensively in ob
taining copies of documents which
would otherwise necessitate trips to
! libraries on the Atlantic seaboard.
Photostat copies of films, better
still, may be developed at a cost ap
proximating 8 ccnts each, on post- i
card size paper. Thus, the rare
' French copy of Memoirs des Nego- |
I tiations for the Peace of Paris, 1763, i
which Francis Parkman bequeathed j
to Harvard Library, exists in Stan- !
ford Library on 3 by# (5-inch cards, j
1 and with the aid of a magnifying [
lens can easily be read.
A list of rare publications in the
Library of Congress, arranged by
subjects, is on catalogue in the Li
brary, and by sending for a "movie"
j of the desired document, a student
may save a trip to Washington.
