# Tau Beta Pi Affiliation Is Sought Here
## Epsilon Eta Sigma Asks To Join National 
### 
The Stanford chapter of Epsilon
Eta Sigma, men's honorary engi
neering fraternity, has petitioned for
membership in Tau Beta Pi, national
engineering fraternity. It is be
lieved the petition will be acted
upon soon, it was announced last
night.
Tau Beta Pi has a high rating as
a national honorary fraternity, and
membership is excluded to all but
the best engineering schools. There
are 65 chapters; California and Cal
Tech are the only members in this
state.
The petition was started two years
ago, when the engineering depart
ment here first announced itself as
interested in membership in the
national fraternity. It will be acted
on by the executive council of Tau
Beta Pi in April, and will then be
circulated among present chapters
for approval. Definite announcement
of the outcome probably wil lbe
made late in spring quarter.
To insure admission, Epsilon Eta
Sigma here has excluded member
ship to students who would more
than fulfill Tau Beta Pi require
ments.
Chuck Glasgow, local head, has
called a meeting for Wednesday
night, at which time several Stan
ford faculty members will be con
sidered for membership.
