# STATE OF SIEGE HITS NICARAGUA

### 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Feb. 22
(UP). â€”The massacre of General
Augustino C. Sandino, his brother,
and five other persons by national
guardsmen last night was followed
by a formal declaration of a state
of siege throughout Nicaragua to
night. It had been feared followers
of Sandino, who have remained
quiet since he arranged a truce with
the government a year ago, might
seek revenge and cause wide-spread
uprisings.
President Juan B. Sacasa issued a
communique publicly denouncing
the killings. He declared they were
acts of lawlessness, and asked con
gi'ess for extraordinary powers to
restore order.
Irate Guards
Authorities, searching for a mo
tive for the shooting of Sandino and
his friends, suggested the guards
might have become irate at recent
derogatory remarks made by the
little jungle warrior against the na
tional guard.
Sandino, first attracted interna
tional attention in 1927 when he
refused to abandon the revolution
of General Sacasa, now president,
against President Emiliano Camorro.
He and a little band of followers
kept northern Nicaragua in an al
most continual uproar, despite the
measures of American marines and
a national guard force.
Public Spirited
General Sandino for the past year
had been engaged in public spirited
works in the interior, seeking to
replace his men on the land and
restore prosperity to the nation
through agricultural improvements.
Sandino reached the capital a
week ago and after conferences with
government officials deaprted. He
returned yesterday and apaprently
had an altercation with national
guard leaders which ended in the
shooting.
