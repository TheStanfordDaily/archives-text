# It's Great to Disagree, But

One of the best hits of luinior which has appeared on
lliis campus is, we Ihink, that pictorial gem in the 1932
Quad which showed a professor greeting his class for the
first lime of Ihc epiarter and saying, as he removed his
pince-nez:
"The lexl in ihis course will he mv hook on . .
Now it's perfectly all right for professors to wrWe
hooks, providing of course that Ihey can depend on some
thing in addition to other hooks for their material. And
it's even agreeable if Ihey foist their literary gems upon
a class which must pay tuition and syllabus fees for the
privilege of purchasing the volume.
But why must the profs put forth their thoughts in
print at from three seventy-five to live and a half per copy
only to have them erased, thrown out and desecrated by
successors who may or may not have written a book, but
who at-any rate agree inwardly that thev will disagree
outwardly with whatever somebody else says?
Staunch individualism is a fine thing. II is a bit hard
lo carry out at times, but il is characterized bv a certain
stoutness which says that the individualist will not be
swayed. II even smacks of Progress, which is the aim and
foundation of Kducation.
Professors are supposed to inculcate the ideas of forg
ing ahead. '
We suggest that they forge ahead one more step by
having department meetings and deciding on one text
which will be used for a period long enough to allow it
lo be sold a few limes from student to student.
