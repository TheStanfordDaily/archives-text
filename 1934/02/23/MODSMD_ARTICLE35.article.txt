# A 						Point to Consider

### 
Editors of the I'niversitv of Southern California's Daily
Trojan awoke the other morning to read of the latest sen
sation in football reports charging Trov, along with Notre
Dame, of placing "undue emphasis" upon~ football.
Accusing the Carnegie statement of presenting only
one side of the story, Editor Wendell Sether tells us a
little bit about our southern contemporaries that might
come as a surprise to many a rabid football enthusiast.
"How many of those people who shout the word 'Tro
jan* on Saturday afternoon know that behind Trojan
stands the foremost school of philosophy in the United
States, that the speech school is rated foremost in the
West, that valuable research work is being carried on by
the School of Medicine, that the student newspaper is one
of the most liberal in the country, and that S.C. students
study under a most enlightened faculty. . . . These are
things that people forget, vet they, not football, make up
the University."
The Daily, refraining from any expression of opinion
on the Carnegie report until a complete copy may be re
ceived and considered, reads the Daily Trojan editorial
caption "Football Mas Not Blinded Our Eyes" and joins
many others in sincerely hoping that it lias not.
