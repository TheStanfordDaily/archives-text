# WHY IT'S NEWS
## F.R. AND CONGRESS 
### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
Many people believe that the j
President is the greatest practical
politician of the century. The fact
that he has kept Congress under his
thumb has a lot to do With it. But
is there any reason why he has been 1
more successful in this than his j
predecessors?
The 1932 Democratic Landslide
A good many Democrats were j
quite surprised at their election in 1
1932. Thinking they had little i
chance, they ran anyway; they were
elected not because they were Dem- |
ocrats, but because they were NOT
Republicans. This makes a lot of
difference; it means that a protest
vote against Republican policies i
elected them—not their party prin
ciples.
In the landslide, many veteran
Republicans lost their jobs; plenty
of rookie Democrats replaced them. '
When Congress met last March, the |
Democrats had two-thirds of the \
House and Senate. But it was all
new and strange to many of them. !
For a while they followed the Roo
sevelt lead blindly; they had no •
policies, he did, and something had j
to be done. So the President told
Congress what he wanted, and they j
obliged.
The Folks Back Home
But the faithful Democrats back j
home began to worry. While the i
party had been out of power for 12 |
years, federal jobs had been scarce; j
they wanted the spoils handed out I
right away. But the President had
a better idea. Congress was getting j
restless, but he needed to have im- !
portant laws passed. So Congress- j
men and Senators were told that i
their friends would get jobs only if !
they supported the President. It i
worked and Congress broke all j
speed records in accepting Roose- j
velt's measures.
Economy and Votes?
During the past year the Presi- j
dent has become a national idol. He >
has also tried to save money by j
cutting most governmental salaries !
15 per cent, and by reducing pay- ;
ments to veterans.
The 435 Congressmen are coming |
up for election this fall. Unless they \
have supported the President, most '
of the Democrats will not be re- •
elected. Roosevelt realizes this, and
still holds this trump card over
Congress.
Many of the voters are unem- !
ployed. The President has tried to j
give them work in the C.W.A., |
P.W.A., etc., until prosperity returns j
in earnest. For the time being, then, |
most of the jobless voters are be- I
ing taken care of.
But the greatest danger to the
President's hold on Congress comes I
from two groups which are not gen- !
erally unemployed: the veterans and j
the government employees. Both :
groups arc well organized: most
Congressmen believe a Legion mem- I
ber can swing five votes besides his 1
own. Both groups feel they have
been cheated when they see billions j
spent for recovery while their bene
fits and pay have been cut. So a j
great deal of pressure is being put
on members of Congress to restore
the veterans' benefits and the gov
ernment pay cuts. *
Is F.R. Losing Grip?
Wednesday, the Senate restored j
the pay cut by one vote, with 13
Democrats deserting the party. A
similar proposal was barely defeated
in the House a few weeks ago. The I
same group behind Wednesday's j
victory plans to trot out restoration i
of veterans' benefits soon. /> 'j
Although the President seems to
be losing some of his great majority
in Congress, it is not because he is
slipping, but because elections are
coming. Legionnaires and govern
ment workers pull a lot of votes and
can't be offended just before an
election. But the chances are that
the President still has a better grip
on Congress than any lobby.
