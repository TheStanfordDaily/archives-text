Dr. Charles A. Kraus of Brown
University, one of the East's most
distinguished scientists, will arrive
in Palo Alto today to study the
graduate curriculum of Stanford as
part of his survey for the National
Research Council Fellowship Board
in Science. Dr. Kraus was named
field secretary of the science fellow
ship board in December.
The findings from Dr. Kraus' sur
vey will be used to determine the
policy of the National Research
Council on fellowships. There are at
the present time approximately GO
graduate students holding National
Research Council fellowships in Eu
rope and America.
The Council was established in
191G by the National Academy of
Sciences hs a war measure for the
effective organization of the scientific
resources of the country. Three
years after the founding of the Coun
cil, fellowships were established in
mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
