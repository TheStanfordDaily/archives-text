Romeo and Juliet, or rather three
Romeos and innumerable Juliets,
were reincarnated on the Stanford
campus at rather an early hour
Thursday morning!
Officer George Burns was cruising
sleepily along, at about two o'clock,
near Ruble, when strains of slow,
distant music reached his startled
ears. And elusive music it was—
for it was all of a half hour later
before Officer Burns wound up at
the Theta house.
There three Romeos were using a
battered car for a piano, accompa
nied by vocal efforts and notes
coming from a trumpet and a man
dolin, as they serenaded the Thetas,
or rather the Juliets, who huddled
on the roof of their house, singing
back at their Romeos.
Into this remarkable scene strode
Offiicer Burns. Quiet reigned once
more upon the campus.
