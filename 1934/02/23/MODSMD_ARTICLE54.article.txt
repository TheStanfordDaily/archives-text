SCORING
Scoring in rugby is accomplished
much the same way as in American
football, the general idea being to
carry ihe ball across the goal line,
or kick it through the goal posts from
a place or drop kick. This done, the
kiekee or carryee can only depend
hopefully on the honesty and good
eyesight of the referee, which is
needed lo complete the contract.
Touching the ball down across
the goal line is called a try and
counts J points for your team or
the other blanks, depending on
whose goal line it is. The scorer
does not necessarily carry the ball
over, but may bave kicked or
dribbled it. If a member of the
opposing team touches the ball
down behind his own goal line, it
is similar to the touchbaek in
American, and the defensive team
gets a drop kick from behind their
own 25-yard line.
This latter situation is termed the
25-yard drop-out, or in sports slang,
two-bit drop-out.
After making a try, the scoring
team gets a chance to convert it, but
instead of placing the ball nicely in
front of the goal posts, it must be
kicltod from a point any distance di
rectly out from where the try was
touched down. Therefore, when the
ball carrier crosses the goal, he at
tempts to put the ball clown close to
the goal posts in order to make the
angle a\sy for the kicker.
However, he had best not dally
around while in the act of scoring
the try, for the opposition may, if
they «an, pick him lip bodily and
carry him hack across the goal, or
by holding him up prevent him
from touching the hall down. In
the latter event, a scrum, is called
on the five-yard line.
A good conversion gives the scor
ing team an additional two points;
the try and conversion, amounting
to five points, is sometimes called a
goal.
And the ball is carried or kicked
out of the end zone there is no score,
and a 25 drop-out ensues; the samo
thing happens if the ball or ball car
rier's body touches the corner flags.
Place kicks through the goal
posts from the field count for 3
points, and usually occur when a
free kick is called as penalty for a
foul. The less said about these the
better.
A drop kick from the field of play
is very spectacular when done, and
seems io be quite a rarity in these
parts. '"Dink" Templeton is sup
posed to have booted such a kick
over from the 45-yard line when
playing for the American Olympic
team against France in 1920; and as
we have never heard of his denying
it, the distance stands with us. When
made, it's good for four points.
The next time we get a chance,
something about the players, for
wards and backs, and ihe scrum, will
be said. —Hamilton

the goal posts in order to make the
angle a\sy for the kicker.
However, he had best not dally
around while in the act of scoring
the try, for the opposition may, if
they «an, pick him lip bodily and
carry him hack across the goal, or
by holding him up prevent him
from touching the hall down. In
the latter event, a scrum, is called
on the five-yard line.
A good conversion gives the scor
ing team an additional two points;
the try and conversion, amounting
to five points, is sometimes called a
goal.
And the ball is carried or kicked
out of the end zone there is no score,
and a 25 drop-out ensues; the samo
thing happens if the ball or ball car
rier's body touches the corner flags.
Place kicks through the goal
posts from the field count for 3
points, and usually occur when a
free kick is called as penalty for a
foul. The less said about these the
better.
A drop kick from the field of play
is very spectacular when done, and
seems io be quite a rarity in these
parts. '"Dink" Templeton is sup
posed to have booted such a kick
over from the 45-yard line when
playing for the American Olympic
team against France in 1920; and as
we have never heard of his denying
it, the distance stands with us. When
made, it's good for four points.
The next time we get a chance,
something about the players, for
wards and backs, and ihe scrum, will
be said. —Hamilton

SCORING
Scoring in rugby is accomplished
much the same way as in American
football, the general idea being to
carry ihe ball across the goal line,
or kick it through the goal posts from
a place or drop kick. This done, the
kiekee or carryee can only depend
hopefully on the honesty and good
eyesight of the referee, which is
needed lo complete the contract.
Touching the ball down across
the goal line is called a try and
counts J points for your team or
the other blanks, depending on
whose goal line it is. The scorer
does not necessarily carry the ball
over, but may bave kicked or
dribbled it. If a member of the
opposing team touches the ball
down behind his own goal line, it
is similar to the touchbaek in
American, and the defensive team
gets a drop kick from behind their
own 25-yard line.
This latter situation is termed the
25-yard drop-out, or in sports slang,
two-bit drop-out.
After making a try, the scoring
team gets a chance to convert it, but
instead of placing the ball nicely in
front of the goal posts, it must be
kicltod from a point any distance di
rectly out from where the try was
touched down. Therefore, when the
ball carrier crosses the goal, he at
tempts to put the ball clown close to
the goal posts in order to make the
angle a\sy for the kicker.
However, he had best not dally
around while in the act of scoring
the try, for the opposition may, if
they «an, pick him lip bodily and
carry him hack across the goal, or
by holding him up prevent him
from touching the hall down. In
the latter event, a scrum, is called
on the five-yard line.
A good conversion gives the scor
ing team an additional two points;
