# SEALS TIE CARDS AT 7-7 AS DARKNESS HALTS TILT
## 
### 
The Kenealy Seals sprinted in to
a fast finish Wednesday on the
Sunken diamond, scoring six runs in
the last three frames to tie the Stan
ford varsity baseball team 7 to 7
when rain and darkness called a halt
to the hotly-waged contest.
Stan Anderson pitched the first six
innings for the Cards, holding the
Seals to one run and three hits as
his males piled up six counters to set
a comfortable lead. In the seventh,
Anderson gave way on the mound to
"Lefty" Campbell, whose offerings
were knocked hither and yon by the
hard hitting Seals, scoring four runs
on as many hits before Fred Herin
ger was injected to stop the on
slaught.
Seals Tie Score
The Kenealy Seals tied the score
at six all in the eighth after two men
were out. Geisberger opened the in
ning beating out a nicely placed
bunt down the third base line. Ger
ran Hew to Captain Dick Miles in
center who made a great diving catch
behind the shortstop patch. Dono
van whiffed and Berger came to the
plate. The latter popped an easy fly
to short right which Nutting mis
judged, Geisberger scoring. Cronin
popped to Tremaine behind third to
end the inning.
In Stanford's half of the same
canto, Bobby Grayson started the
ball rolling by socking a hard liner
to right center for two bases, fol
lowed by an infield hit when Jim
Massey beat out a bunt, sending
Grayson to third. Heringer struck
out, and Massey stole second. Frank
Tremaine walked to fill the bases.
Bob Hamilton, the next man up, hit
a fly to center, Grayson beating Ber
ger's throw to the plate for the
Card's last tally of the game.
In the last inning the visitors once
more knoited the score on two sin
gles. The Cards did not threaten in
their half of the last frame.
Cards Splotchy
Stanford played splotchy baseball
on the field, turning in a number of
brilliant plays but at other times
making costly errors. At the plate
the Indians again demonstrated ihat
they possess batting strength, hitting
Mike Salinson and Lefty Fieber lib
erally. Salinson and Fieber are on
the hurling staff of the Oaks in the
Coast League.
Stanford takes on A1 Erie's All-
Stars here tomorrow afternoon if
weather permits. The game will be
called at 2:30 o'clock on the Sunken
diamond.
