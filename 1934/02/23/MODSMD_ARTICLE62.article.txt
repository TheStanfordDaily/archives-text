# BABE HOOP MEN CLASH WITH CUBS
## 
### 
The second clean sweep of the
little-big hoop series in two years
by Jimmy Bradshaw s Stanford
frosh forces looms tomorrow night
when the two yearling fives get
their opening tip-oft at 6:i!0 o'clock
in the Pavilion, preceding the In
dian-Bear varsity game.
Since their second trimming at
the hands of the Papooses, 41-28,
three weeks ago, the U.C. year
lings have played three games, win
ning the first two and dropping the
third, but still seem to be battling
the curse of erratic play.
Cubs Dangerous
With a clean-cut .'3O-25 win over
the good Modesto Junior College
forces, Bill Biggins' men seemed to
be finally headed lor a series of
wins that would make them enter
tomorrow night's encounter as a de
cidedly dangerous underdog.
In their last game, however, the
Cubs apparently slipped into their
old slump, allowing Stockton High
to gain an almost unbeatable 20-8
lead at half time and trying to pull
the game out of the fire with a last
half rush, which ended four points
short, 30-26. Several weeks before,
the Stockton preps journeyed to the
Farm and showed little during a
29-12 licking by the Card frosh.
Cub Forwards Good
Yet the Berkeley frosh will shoot
the works in their last game and
may crack through with a torn if
they can put a couple of hot for
wards into the fray. The Stanford
frosh under-bucket defense, com
posed of Captain Dinty Moore, Carl
Schott, and La Rue Smith, has im
proved so greatly in the past two
weeks as far as aggressiveness and
picking the ball off the back-board
goes, that the Cal Cubs' height ad
vantage will probably go for nought.
Unless the Cal yearlings show an
uniooked - for amount of power.
Jimmy Bradshaw will not depend
on his veteran first string five to
score the winning tallies, but ex
pects a small but smooth second
string five to outplay the Cub firsts.
Starting' Centers
The center post call will go to
John Sullivan, whose injured knee
has made him an in-and-outer. Sul
livan will probably not get the tip
off from Herwig, Cal's hefty center,
but works in well on the passing
game. Bradshaw will start a couple
of pony guards in Jim Dillon and
Larry Randall.
The starting line-ups: California
frosh—Greenwood and Knight, for
wards; Herwig, center; Sparks and
Young, guards. Stanford frosh —
Duncan and Huff, forwards; Sulli
van, center; Randall and Dillon,
guards.
