# BABE TRACKMEN SET FOR SAN MATEO J.C.
## Williams, Voigt to Head Freshmen Forces 
### 
Opening their 1934 season against
a strong dual meet team, Coach Bill
Ellington's frosh track squad will
meet Tex Byrd's forces from San
Mateo Junior College on Angell
Field tomorrow morning at 10:30
o'clock, with javelin and pole vault
events scheduled to start shortly af
ter the hour.
What promises to be a great duel
in the half-mile may be ruined by
a slow track, unless-the Angell Field
tval gets plenty of sunshine today.
Warren Dixon, who has bettered two
flat several times while running for
the Olympic Club and Mission High
during the past half dozen years,
looks to be the favorite since Bill
McCurdy, the frosh's best, is still
out of condition.
Alexander Fast
Bob Alexander has been running
since fall which should allow him
around 2:02, and if the track is boggy
Alexander may be fighting it out for
the first, for the Santa Barbara, is a
good mucker.
The sprints will find Freddy Wil
liams and Chuck Voigt of the frosh
facing one of their greatest contests
of the season in meeting Ray Deane.
A week ago Deane, Williams, and
Voigt ran through a practice hun
dred in ten flat, breasting the tape
in a blanket finish.
March in Mile
Rusty March has the task of filling
in Chuck Nimjno's shoes as a frosh
miler, and his work during the past
few weeks shows him to be. a strong,
smooth hunner who should be hitting
around 4:30 before the close of the
season.
San Mateo will also have the upper
hand in the discus event, with Levy
and King ready to grab first and se
cond places. Walton, Spencer, and
Bergmen will toss for the frosh.
Evans Hurdles
Ernie Evans, who has been push
ing 1.C.-4A champ Gus Meier in
both hurdles all spring, is good for
ten points in the barrier events.
Ralph Kingsbury should pick up a
few more points for the yearlings.
Other yearlings who may make
points are Williams and Charters in
the 220, Voigt, Faye, and Greene in
the quarter, Gonzales and Moller in
the high jump, Voigt and KaufT
man, broad jumpers; Williamson,
Williams, Dodds, and Turretto in the
javelin, and a relay team four to be
made up oi' Voigt, March, Greene,
Faye, and Alexander.
