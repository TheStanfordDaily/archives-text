COAST HOOP
PLAYOFF IN OFFING

Unless the lowly Bruin or the
slightly loss lowly Indian manages
to upset all predictions again tonight
or tomorrow, California and U.S.C.
will meet next week-end in a playoff
for the southern division basketball
title of the Pacific Coast Conference
and the right to meet
northern winner, for the Conference
championship.
However, both Stanford and U.C.
L.A. have upset their stronger and
supposedly impregnable rivals and
they might do it again. John Bunn'.s
outfit pulled the first surprise of the
season when it trimmed the mighty
Trojan in his own back yard in their
second encounter of rhe season. At
that time, il looked as though the
Trojan cause was rather hopelessly
lost, especially after the following
week-end when U.S.C. and Califor
nia split their two-game series, for
no one rated U.C.L.A. or Stanford
the slightest chance of upsetting the
Rears.

LOOKED AS IF
BEARS WERE IN

So tip until last Saturday, it looked
as though California was already in.
Then the heretofore docile country
cousins turned around and slapped
their rich relations back on their
heels and into a tie with S.C. for the
lead. It's almost too much to, hope
for anoiher reversal of form by one
of the two tailenders but in view of
wh;it has already happened, the pos
sibility is not too remote.
Of the two, Stanford probably has
a slightly better chance of eking out
a victory and the Indians are about
due, not having won a basketball
game from California since the first
encounter of the 1931 series. U.C.
L.A.'s inexperienced sophomores can
hardly expect to cope with the vet
eran Southern Californians.

of the two tailenders but in view of
wh;it has already happened, the pos
sibility is not too remote.
Of the two, Stanford probably has
a slightly better chance of eking out
a victory and the Indians are about
due, not having won a basketball
game from California since the first
encounter of the 1931 series. U.C.
L.A.'s inexperienced sophomores can
hardly expect to cope with the vet
eran Southern Californians.

HEAVY PROGRAM
ON SPORTS CALENDAR

The sports calendar for the week
end is loaded down with events.
Topping (he bill are the two basket
ball games with California. Coach
Nort Thornton takes his water polo
ists over to Berkeley for the game
which will decide conference cham
pionship and the Bear-Indian rugby
match, called off yesterday because
of rain, will be played tomorrow.
Stanford and Arizona play the fi
nal game of their polo series on the
Highway field and the varsity ball
team meets A1 Erie's All-Stars on
Ihe Sunken diamond tomorrow,
while the frosh nine plays in the
morning. Tennis matches are sched
uled for today and tomorrow, this
afternoon's between the frosh and
Varsity being the headline!*. Frosh
trackster.s open ,their season tomor
row against San Mateo Junior Col
lege, and varsity and frosh golfers
vie with other California linksmen
at Del Monte for the state intercol
legiate crown. —Tremaine
COAST HOOP
PLAYOFF IN OFFING

Unless the lowly Bruin or the
slightly loss lowly Indian manages
to upset all predictions again tonight
or tomorrow, California and U.S.C.
will meet next week-end in a playoff
for the southern division basketball
title of the Pacific Coast Conference
and the right to meet
northern winner, for the Conference
championship.
However, both Stanford and U.C.
L.A. have upset their stronger and
supposedly impregnable rivals and
they might do it again. John Bunn'.s
outfit pulled the first surprise of the
season when it trimmed the mighty
Trojan in his own back yard in their
second encounter of rhe season. At
that time, il looked as though the
Trojan cause was rather hopelessly
lost, especially after the following
week-end when U.S.C. and Califor
nia split their two-game series, for
no one rated U.C.L.A. or Stanford
the slightest chance of upsetting the
Rears.

LOOKED AS IF
BEARS WERE IN

So tip until last Saturday, it looked
as though California was already in.
Then the heretofore docile country
cousins turned around and slapped
their rich relations back on their
heels and into a tie with S.C. for the
lead. It's almost too much to, hope
for anoiher reversal of form by one
of the two tailenders but in view of
wh;it has already happened, the pos
sibility is not too remote.
