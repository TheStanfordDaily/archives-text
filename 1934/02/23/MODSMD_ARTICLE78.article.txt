# Stanford Poloists Defeat Arizona Four, 8 to 4
## LUPPEN, ROGERS STAR IN OPENING CLASH OF SERIES 
### 
Playing an outstanding brand of
polo despite a muddy field, Stan
ford's quartet of riders defeated the
University of Arizona poloists 8 to
4 yesterday in the first tilt of a two
game series with the Wildcats. The
second game will be played at 2:30
o'clock tomorrow afternoon.
Luppcn Leads
Arizona took an early lead when
Warren Hurgrave scored at the be
ginning of the first chukker. Cap
tain Luppe Luppen, who played an
outstanding game all afternoon for
Stanford, soon retaliated, however,
to even the score.
The half ended with Stanford
holding a 4 to 2 lead, with Bill Rog
ers and Luppe Luppcn each respon
sible for two goals. Neilson Brown
scored Arizona's second point.
Struck by a shot from the mallet of
the Arizona back, Luppen whipped
the ball back through the posts in
one of the prettiest bits of work of
the day for his second goal of the
half.
Rogers Scores
Bill Rogers, who shared individual
honors with Luppen, was respon
sible for the first score of the fourth
chukker, with Bob Fullerton follow
ing it up to give Stanford a decisive
6-2 lead. Goals by Brown and Lup
pen ended the scoring for the pe
riod.
Holding the Indians to a goose
egg, Arizona put through a goal in
the fifth chukker to outsccre Stan
ford for the first time in the game.
What looked like a possible Wildcat
rally, however, was nipped in the
bud, for the Arizonans were held
scoreless for the balance of the
game. Stanford scored one more
goal in the sixth period to finish up
with a total of eight to the visitors'
four.
Although slowed up somewhat by
the wet field, the two teams put on
a much faster game than was ex
pected and, with no more rain, Sat
urday's contest should be excep
tionally speedy and interesting.
Though outscored, the visitors dis
played considerable ability and may
easily come back to take the second
game tomorrow, as they did last fall.
