# Wrestler Temporarily Paralyzed Alter Fall
## 
### 
Proof that the "grunt-an'-groan"
boys, the wrestlers, are not always
faking their matches came Wednes
day night when A1 BafTert, French-
Canadian wrestler, heaved Dave
Johnson, 32, Oakland wrestler, out |
of the ring, temporarily paralyzing i
him.
Physicians feared that Johnson |
would never wrestle again, but after
an X-ray revealed torn ligaments in
his spine and pelvis to be the cause j
of the trouble, he was released from ;
St. Agnes Hospital yesterday.
