# U.C. SHARK
## 
### 
The University of California was
beginning to wonder if the 20-foot
J shark recently acquired by the Zo
ollogy Department was just another
white elephant, but the worrk was
easily solved. Zoology "butchers"
were put to work cutting the shark
! into small pieces, and scores of stu
dents immediately swarmed to the
i scene in order to obtain bits of shark
steak. ,
