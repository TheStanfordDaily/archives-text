After showing base running abil
ity, a pick-up in fielding technique, i
and a little better batting Tuesday, !
Stanford freshman baseball players'
will meet the Galileo High School
team on the frosh field here Satur
day.
So far this year, trie Card year
lings have played poor baseball on
Saturdays, and a fairly good game in
the middle of the week. They will
attempt to break the Saturday jinx
before it becomes a complex.
In Tuesday's game, Coach Ernie'
Nevers' squad showed promise, and
looked like a developing baseball
team.
Galileo probably will furnish more
competition than did Sequoia High
School, and with Stanford playing
their best ball, the game should be
close. It will start at 10 o'clock to
morrow.
