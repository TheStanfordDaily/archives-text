# TRUCK IN DEFY WEATHER TO WORK FOR COWING MEETS
## 
### 
Hampered somewhat by rain and
attendant mud, trackmen are get
ting in shape for scheduled meets
i.nd for the big all-University living
group meet to be held March 10, in
place of the usual interclass meet.
This arrangement was decided on
as a result of Ihe comparative popu
larity of the intramural meets, and
permits members of both frosh and
varsity track teams to compete for
their fraternity, eating club, hall, or
other affiliation.
Some of the varsity seem able to
pull their feet out of the mud almost
as fast as they could push the dry
ground back with clean spikes.
Wednesday evening Ernie Evans, the
freshman hurdler, pushed Sam
Klopstoek and Gus Meier so closely
in a 220 low-hurdle trial that Klop
stoek had to do 24.5 to beat Meier
by inches and Evans by a yard.
Klopstoek now holds decisions over
Meier in both highs and lows.
Another surprising performance
was turned in by A1 Blackman, a
quarter-mile in 48.6 seconds, which
is better time around the Angel 1
field oval than any Stanford man
has yet made, with the exception of
"Blazin" Ben" Eastman.

As soon as a scenario is selected,
a motion picture based on the writ
ing and editing of a college paper
will be produced at the University of
•Southern California, department of
cinematography.
