## 
### 
Have you ever felt, when driv
ing, tha' you had ,h semi-flat tire?
And climbed out to kick all four?
The necessity for this inconven
ience has been eliminated by the

vented by James W. McDonnell,
assistant superintendent of Uni
versity buildings and grounds.
The automatic alarm flashes on
a warning light globe on the dash
board of the car when the pres
sure in a lire drops below a cer
tain minimum. A small diaphragm
arrangement, responsive to pres
sure, is at'ached to the valve
steam of a tire, which, when the
air pressure drops below the min
imum, closes a contact completing
an electrical circuit and flashing
Ihe light globe alarm. McDonnell
