HEDDA GABLER (Ibsen). At the
Columbia Theatre
Taken for all in all, this is largely
a play of character, specifically that
of Hedda Gabler, in whom Ibsen
crcated perhaps his most interesting
heroine. Calm, austere, aloof, and
self-possessed, she had a definite
sense of the futility of existence
which seems to echo much of the
social protest found in the other
Ibsen plays.
In addition to the character of
Hedda, there are four others of less
er interest, there is some well-writ
ten dialogue, and several exciting
and moving sequences. All of
these qualities are brought out in
the current Eva LeGallienne pro
ducation of the piece.
Miss LeGallienne's direction dis
plays a keen understanding of the
idea and mood of the play, and the
performance is nicely focused on the
central character.
As the amazing Hedda, Miss Le-
Gallienne gives an amazing per
formance. It is evident that she has
a clear understanding of the char
acter, for her work is a paragon of
thoroughness and consistence. Not
only did she—through broad ges
tures and a dramatic voice—hold the
audience in all her scenes, but she
likewise sustained their interest
during the scenes between the minor
characters.
Paul Leyssac was splendid as Tes
man, creating a genuinely sincere
character, truly poignant in his
inability to understand his wife. The
others were uniformly excellent.
