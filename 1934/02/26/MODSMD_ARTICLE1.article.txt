That plans for the improvement of
the University Assembly Hall are
being actively considered by Stan
ford Administration officials was re
vealed by Almon E. Roth, comp
troller, in a statement to The Daily
over the week-end.
Roth, who has been actively work- j
ing on the problem himself for the
past month, said that Assembly Hall
improvement had been first on the
budget for the past few years but'
that financial conditions had cut ex
tra expenditures to a minimum,
showing that the Administration
coincided with the general campus
demand for a more adequate meet
ing place.
Replace Seats
Improvement, tentatively set to
begin during the summer quarter of i
1934, will consist in the replacement
of 500 of the present seats by a new
type, the design of which has not
been determined.
Substituting at the rate ol 500 an
nually and working from tne front
to the back, these renlterations will
probably be finished within three
years, if all of the present 1,746 seats i
arc replaced. Roth also staled that
the present seating arrangement is j
not considered satisfactory, implying
that changes would also be made in (
this line.
As for the use of the $150,000
war memorial fund suggested as a
source of financial aid by The
Daily, Roth believed the construc
tion of a new hall, as now planned,
would not coincide with the spirit i
in which the funds were sub
scribed.
Acoustics Satisfactory
From the standpoint of acoustics, j
the present hall is satisfactory, the j
comptroller said, with the exception â– 
of two small .spots in the balcony.!
While a new hall is not contemplated
for the coming few years, Stanford J
might get a modern hall suitable fori
the spoken drama under the general
development plans for the Univer
sity.
The comptroller said that in the!
construction of the south quadrangle, j
in the area between ihe English cor
ner and Encina hall, provision may I
be made for a theatre, to be con- ;
structed on a scale smallar than the
present hall and for dramatic pur
poses. Tentative cost bids for the
building of a memorial tower, an
arcade court, and a theatre have been
received, but were not disclosed.
