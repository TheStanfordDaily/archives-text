# Army Parades Tank On Campus Today
## 
### 
Stanford's military tank, which at !
the height of its glory saw much
service but which 5 s now "retired"
in the military museum, will once ;
more see the outside world. At noon
today its lumbering form will emerge j
from its resting place to make its
annual public appcarance on the
campas when Nat Kendall, chair
man of the military ball, will drive i
it in all its glory around the campus.,
This famous old tank, which failed j
to stop for shot or shell, mets its
Waterloo a few yeaiT. ago when it
met an enemy that proved too ir
resistable. Officer Gordon Davis
once gave it a ticket for parading on |
the campus. Tomorrow, however, the 'â– 
old Vetera.i will fuifill its mission of
reminding the campus of the military
ball and then retire into seclusion
for another year.
Pilot Nat Kendall hopes that the
appearance of the tank will remind
those students who have not yet
bought their bids that the military 1
Lall is being held Friday evening,
March 2.
