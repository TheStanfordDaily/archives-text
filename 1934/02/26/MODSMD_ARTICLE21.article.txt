# Report of Communist Plot Ridiculed by Professors Here
## 
### 
That any Communist plot to cap- |
ture American youth through the
school and college sensationally re
ported on the front page of Hearst's
San Francisco morning paper yes
terday, is of any importance is l
heartily ridiculed by Stanford pro- ,
fessors and students.
The Hearst paper emphasized it.- i
stand that students in the United
States are being taught methods, ob
jectives, programs, and tactics as
approved by Ihe Third International. 1
It was contended that Communists'
organizations are gaining a strong
foothold in our colleges, in which
there arc now 129 chapters.
Magazine Circulated
The Student Review, published by 1
the National Student League of thr
Communist International, is being
sent to student agents in colleges, ii
was stated, in which Stanford was
listed*as receiving 25 copies; Uni

vcrsity of California, Berkeley, 100;
Lew Angeles, four agents, 110; and
"Why shouldn't they be sold
here?" remarked Professor Edwin A.
Cottroll, head of the Political Science
Department. He said he thought the
idea of playing up and condemning
of Communism publications was
foolish.
'"Why not give students a chance
to find out what is going on?" Those
firings ought to be made available
for people to read."
Hearst Ridiculed
Walter Thompson, associate pro
fessor of Political Science, said he
thought Hearst was "just having a
brainstorm," in commenting on Am
erican colleges. He explained that
the whole thing is very insignificant
because of the relatively small num
ber of the membership and publi
cation subscribers.
Expressing the opinion that he did
not think I he Hearst article showed

anything serious, Thompson said, "if
University of Washington, Seattle,'JCi.
American students are growing up."
He laughed at the idea that Hearst
was becoming excited at radicalism
in American colleges.
No Danger Here
President Jerry Trautmar., repre
senting the student viewpoint, .said
he had been talking to Wakefield
Taylor, president of the California
student body, about the Berkeley
bombings and general trouble. He
said, however, that he though there
was no danger at Stanford.
Dick Van Wagenen, Men's Council
member, doubted tint Communism
had actually gained in strength
greatly, but expressed himself as
not radically against the movement.
"The chief advantage is in making
people think," he said.
Mat Evans, president of the local
chapter of the League for Industrial
Democracy, could not be contacted.
