# Constitutional Committee To Confer With '800' On Vice Presidency Problem
## Students, Faculty Tell Of Dissatisfaction Under Present Rules 
### 
Campus leaders yesterday ex-'
pressed general dissatisfaction with
the present A.S.S.U. constitution and j
said they hoped for greater efficiency
and simplicity in the new one now
being written. Opinions of some stu
dent and faculty authorities follow:,
A.S.S.U. President Jerry Traut
man: "The Associated Students is I
now operating under a constitution
which was drawn up several years,
ago. Every year it has given us more
trouble, and a new constitution is j
now necessary. To this end the Con
stitutional Revision Committee has i
worked long and hard to remove
present ambiguities and draft a sim
plified constitution.'
Professor Edwin Cottrcll, head of
the Political Science Department;
"The old constitution is conflicting in
a good many places, and many por- ;
tions of it have not been followed in ,
practiceâ€”a recent example of that is '
the last AS.S.U. election, in which
ballots were not printed in legal form j
according to the rule. It is simply a i
question of writing a simple docu
ment which embodies a better form
of organization, without many unco- j
ordinated agencies which now exist."
Jeanne Millard, A.W.S. president:
"The fact that the old constitution
Is obsolete needs no elaboration. I
think plan No. 4 will meet the needs
of the situation at present. It seems |
to be the most equitable plan and I.
hope it will be adopted."
Dean Marion R. Kirkwood. of the
Law School: "The chicf objection to
the old constitution Is thai there is
too much legislation in it, causing a !
great many ambiguities. The old
constitution does not give the Exec- .
utive Committee enough powers.
Good constitutional theory would
provide a framework, and then leave !
determination of legislative rules to
the legislative body. Under the pres
ent complicated system changes are :
too difficult."
