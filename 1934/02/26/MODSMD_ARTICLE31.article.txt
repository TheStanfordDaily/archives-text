# Politics Invade Houses And Halls in Tonight's Meetings
## 
### Frank Orr 
Stanford women collectively enter
(he realm of A.S.S.U. politics tonight
for the first time when they meet
in their living groups to express an
opinion on their own problemâ€”
whether the A.S.S.U. vice-president
shall be a woman and whether she
shall be elected at large or by a
feminine vote.
A meeting of tho committee wilh
the Women's Conference last Wed
nesday put the matter in the hands
of co-ed gioups, after some of the
'"800" had opposed the original prop
osition that the woman vice-presi
dent be elected by a general vote.
Five Choices
A selection of five propositions is
offered to tonight's house and hall
meetings, suggestions varying in ef
fect and in the question of the vice
president's vote. In case of a femi
nine vote on the A.S.S.U. second
officer, most plans provide she shall
be an ex-officio member of the Ex
Committee.
Increased women's registration is
seen as one of the significant factors
in the need for a now constitution
when one plan provides for either a
man or woman student body presi
dent. The greater number of women
also occasioned the almost general
proposition that the A.W.S. be con
solidated with ihe A.S.S.U.
Vice-President Vote
The question of the vice-presi
dency vote is only one of many
stones bestrewing the committee's
path to an efficient government, each
of which must be dug out and dis
posed of separately before the new
document is finally submitted to a
student vo(e at a special election
early next quarter.
Appointed last fall by President
Jerry Trautman under the existing
constitution to revise and rewrite the
old document, the committee was
the answer to widespread dissatis
faction with the involved and con
tradictory rules now in effect, which
provided for amendment and revi
sion this quarter and every four
years afterward.
New Constitution
General opposition 1o many of the
phases of the system, however,
brought about determination to write
an entirely new set of laws, by-laws,
and charters.
Serving on the committee under
the leadership of Chairman Al Dcn
ney are Crcmpton Bangs, secretary;
Abe Mellinkoff, Jerry Trautman, and
Jeanne Millard, ex-officio.
