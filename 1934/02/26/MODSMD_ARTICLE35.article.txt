# â€”And to the Poloists
## 
### 
And while a bloody bill unbowed basketball learn ac
quitted itself nobly by spiking the Berkeley boys' confer
ence hopes C.aptain Dick (Jordan's hard-riding poloists
downed the Arizona Wildcats and annexed the unofficial
intercollegiate polo championship of the coast.
Despite poor weather, a fair crowd turned out to sup
port a team which was to prove that it hadn't been over
rated, a squad of riders claimed by many to be the best
Stanford has ever had, who lived up to that claim by
administering a decisive defeat to the boys oil' the desert
ranches.
Eight to four is a lot of goals and it seems almost like
a walk-out. One thing should be noted, however, and that
is that Arizona was playing on strange ponies, a distinct
disadvantage in the tirst game of any man's polo series.
Luppe Luppen, Mill Rogers, and the bovs won decisively,
but it was no rout. Arizona was as worthy an opponent as
any school west of the Rockies is able lo muster, and had
the second game not been called due to, rain, its score
would have been substantially closer.
To the mallet-men, the student body gives laurels, ex
tends thanks, and hopes for more championships in the
future.
