THE ENCHANTED COTTAGE
(Pinero)
At the Palo Alto Community Theatre
The Enchanted Cottage is a much
more rational and a better construc
ted fantasy than the popular and
overrated Berkeley Square. In the
first act, Pinero mixes his ingredi
ents of comedy, mystery, and pathos
in his story of the good but ugly
young couple. The second act is
"wholly their romantic dream; they
see themselves as what they have al
ways wished to be. The third act
suspense—will they seem beautiful
to the world as they do to each
other?—shows Pinero's adeptness at
good theatre.
Sometimes, in the Community
Theatre production, the tenuous
thread of lantasy stretched thin, but
it never broke. The difficult dream
scene was handled well; the elusive
dream quality was achieved through
a shimmering underwater effect of
the lights, the silence of most of the
dream figures, and their shrieks and
sudden vanishing at the witch's
laughter. The smooth co-ordination
of music, action, and lights, with the
sudden thrills of fear at the lightning,
the screams, and the laughter, gave
a strangely authentic impression of
accurate dream psychology.
Peg Converse's peculiar feeling for '
wistfulness made her scenes as the
ugly waif very poignant and touch
ing. There is an infinitely pathetic
turn to her voice which expresses
wistfulness, amusement, and tender
longing, nil in a single -cadence. Joe
Whitaker gave a consistent and capa- j
ble performance of the crippled hero. |
Virginia Marvin, as the compara
tively silent but compelling Mrs.
Minnett, furnished the most tensely
dramatic moments in the play. l
Through studied gesture and intel
ligent timing, she gradually changed i
her first sharp impression of men- !
ace and mystery, until in her third- :
act speech, which emphasized the
point of i.he play, she gained sym
pathy and admiration in just three '
or four lines.
Atha Hillback, in a talky comedy j
role which furnished relieving con- !
trast to the general slow tempo, gave
a really funny interpretation of the
English countrywoman. She resisted
the temptation to overdo the part in
an Alice Brady manner, and exag- '
gerated her inflections just enough
tc seem very real and very funny at
the same time.
Charles Barnes, never once forget
ting Major Hillgrove's blindness,
showed what strength, simplicity and
quietness can give to a role. Lucie
Bentley, Joe Lawry, and Stanley:
Pearce were characteristically comic
in smaller roles.
In design and execution, the set
ting was nothing short of magnifi- 1
cent. —Brauns
