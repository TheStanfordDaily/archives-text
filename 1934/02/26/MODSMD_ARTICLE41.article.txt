# WHY IT'S NEWS
## WHEN DOES THE FIGHTING START? 
### CROMPTON BANGS Jr 
Most military (whatever
that means) agree that Ihere will be
a war between Russia and Japan.
The only thing they disagree about
is when it will start. # Some say this
spring; most of them say it will be
within two years.
If two dogs start fighting, there is
usually a bone to fight over. If Ja
pan and Russia go to war it will be
over who is going to dominate North
ern Manchukuo and Outer Mon
golia.
Last week, it was rumored that
the troublesome Chinese Eastern
Railway (one of the smaller bones
of contention) had finally been sold
to Japan by Russia, thus allowing
the war talk to die down.
This deal may do just that, but
there is a lot more to this situation
than just the railway. So sitting on
the fence between Siberia and Man
chukuo let's look at both sides of
the picture.
Japan's Side
Sixty million Japanese are living
in a space about the size of Califor
nia. Twenty million Koreans (sub
jects of Japan) are occupying a pen
insula as big as San Bernardino
County. Most of the country is
mountainous. The population has
recently been growing one million a
year. Jap.in couldn't raise enough
food to feed her people, or mine
enough coal and iron to keep her
factories going.
But the rich Chinese province of
Manchuria bordered on Korea and
could furnish her needs for a long
time. Siberia encircled the northern

I end of the province, and this is!
where the trouble started.
Japan pushed out in Manchuria, |
spent a lot of money, and improved |
the country. Very few Japanese ;
went there, bccause they could not I
compete with the Chinamen, who j
worked for three or four cents a |
day, but the country became a very I
important and necessary part of Ja- J
pan's economic system. War lords
maintained efficient, if rifthless, or- !
der, and the twenty million Chi-,
nese who had moved in, worked for
the Japanese and were satisfied.
A few years ago, bandits replaced •
war lords, Japan moved in her [
troops and began to chase them out.
The result of the undeclared war ■
against China was the country of
Manchukuo—supposed to be inde- !
pendent, but not of the Japanese
army. This brought Japan and Rus- j
sia face to face again. Both now
want to dominate northern Manchu- |
kuo and Outer Mongolia, just to the ■
west along the Siberian frontier.
Japan has over 100.000 soldiers in 1
Manchukuo, still "chasing bandits,'
about 400 planes, and miles of mill- ,
tary railways near the Soviet bor- j
der. Her agents are penetrating the :
Soviet stronghold of Outer Mongolia ;
spreading Jap propaganda. Many of |
her younger officers feel a war is j
necessary before Russia gets any j
stronger. So much for Japan.
Russia's Side
The Japan of today fights first and |
declares war afterwards. That is i
what scares Russia. Manchukuo is '
5,000 miles from Moscow by rail on i
the rusty Trans-Siberian. All the j
Russian troops must be moved over
this line, which is very close to the j
Outer Mongolian border.
Russians fear that Japan intends i
to invade Outer Mongolia and cut !
the railway in its most vulnerable !
spot. But they are ready; they have i
200,000 men and GOO planes along the |
border, which is heavily fortified. '
Russia will defend the railway to j
the last ditch, for it is the only line |
to her Pacific port of Vladivostok.
Neither nation is prepared for war. >
Japan is far from self-sufficient and
has few friends. Russia would be at
a terrible disadvantage if forced to
fight at the end of a 5,000-mile rail- i
way. However, she has one of the J
world's best air forces, and could |
easily destroy Japan's flimsy cities, j
The chances are that war will not |
come until Japan's air defenses are I
increased, and the Trans-Siberian is;
put into better shape. By then the J
picture may have changed, but it is '
not likely.

the Japanese and were satisfied.
A few years ago, bandits replaced •
war lords, Japan moved in her [
troops and began to chase them out.
The result of the undeclared war ■
against China was the country of
Manchukuo—supposed to be inde- !
pendent, but not of the Japanese
army. This brought Japan and Rus- j
sia face to face again. Both now
want to dominate northern Manchu- |
kuo and Outer Mongolia, just to the ■
west along the Siberian frontier.
Japan has over 100.000 soldiers in 1
Manchukuo, still "chasing bandits,'
about 400 planes, and miles of mill- ,
tary railways near the Soviet bor- j
der. Her agents are penetrating the :
Soviet stronghold of Outer Mongolia ;
spreading Jap propaganda. Many of |
her younger officers feel a war is j
necessary before Russia gets any j
stronger. So much for Japan.
Russia's Side
The Japan of today fights first and |
declares war afterwards. That is i
what scares Russia. Manchukuo is '
5,000 miles from Moscow by rail on i
the rusty Trans-Siberian. All the j
Russian troops must be moved over
this line, which is very close to the j
Outer Mongolian border.
Russians fear that Japan intends i
to invade Outer Mongolia and cut !
the railway in its most vulnerable !
spot. But they are ready; they have i
200,000 men and GOO planes along the |
border, which is heavily fortified. '
Russia will defend the railway to j
the last ditch, for it is the only line |
to her Pacific port of Vladivostok.
Neither nation is prepared for war. >
Japan is far from self-sufficient and
has few friends. Russia would be at
a terrible disadvantage if forced to
fight at the end of a 5,000-mile rail- i
way. However, she has one of the J
world's best air forces, and could |
easily destroy Japan's flimsy cities, j
The chances are that war will not |
come until Japan's air defenses are I
increased, and the Trans-Siberian is;
put into better shape. By then the J
picture may have changed, but it is '
not likely.
Most military (whatever
that means) agree that Ihere will be
a war between Russia and Japan.
The only thing they disagree about
is when it will start. # Some say this
spring; most of them say it will be
within two years.
If two dogs start fighting, there is
usually a bone to fight over. If Ja
pan and Russia go to war it will be
over who is going to dominate North
ern Manchukuo and Outer Mon
golia.
Last week, it was rumored that
the troublesome Chinese Eastern
Railway (one of the smaller bones
of contention) had finally been sold
to Japan by Russia, thus allowing
the war talk to die down.
This deal may do just that, but
there is a lot more to this situation
than just the railway. So sitting on
the fence between Siberia and Man
chukuo let's look at both sides of
the picture.
Japan's Side
Sixty million Japanese are living
in a space about the size of Califor
nia. Twenty million Koreans (sub
jects of Japan) are occupying a pen
insula as big as San Bernardino
County. Most of the country is
mountainous. The population has
recently been growing one million a
year. Jap.in couldn't raise enough
food to feed her people, or mine
enough coal and iron to keep her
factories going.
But the rich Chinese province of
Manchuria bordered on Korea and
could furnish her needs for a long
time. Siberia encircled the northern

I end of the province, and this is!
where the trouble started.
Japan pushed out in Manchuria, |
spent a lot of money, and improved |
the country. Very few Japanese ;
went there, bccause they could not I
compete with the Chinamen, who j
worked for three or four cents a |
day, but the country became a very I
important and necessary part of Ja- J
pan's economic system. War lords
maintained efficient, if rifthless, or- !
der, and the twenty million Chi-,
nese who had moved in, worked for
the Japanese and were satisfied.
