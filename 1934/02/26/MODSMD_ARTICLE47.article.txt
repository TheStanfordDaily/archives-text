With a second half of air-tight
basketball, in which they held the
visitors to three points, Stanford's
fro.sh whipped the California year
lings 29-11 in Saturday night's pre
liminary to the Cal-Card varsity
game, thereby making a clean sweep
of the little-big hoop series, the sec
ond in as many years.
After .spotting the Cubs to an 8-3
lead while a second five, Dale Huff
and Allen Duncan, forwards, La Rue
Smith, center, and Larry Randall and
Jim Dillon, guards, were on the
court, Coach Jim Bradshaw called
on his veteran forwards and guards
to give the frosh a lead uuring the
fow minutes remaining in the first
half. The first five responded with a
trio of field goals, ont by Howell
Turner and two by Carl Schott, al
lowing the Papooses to leave the
floor at half time with a meagre 9-8
lead.
During the second period the U.C.
yearling defense, as advertised, had
the two Card forwards, Turner and
Bill Quade, substantially throttled
but failed to work out a system to
hold down Captain Dinly Moore, the
Card's offensive threat at guard.
With the forwards covered, Moore
was forced to carry the ball in him
self, and timed his shots so well that
