lIOOP FAMINE ENDED
Stanford's basketball famine camc to a close Friday night when the !
Indian cagemen gorged themselves on Bear meat in a 34 to 20 upset, the |
first Stanford victory over California since the first game of their 1931 series. !
Even though the banquet was rather abruptly ended by California's j
reversal of form Saturday which gave them a 43 to 15 verdict over the
Cards, indications point to a resumption of the feast next year.
Of the five men who started Friday's game, three will he eligible to play j
next season and all three of the substitutes who were used have one or two i
more years of competition.
Only Captain Hal Edelen and Chuck Rogers of the starting live will be j
lost to next year's team which will number among its members Cowing, ;
Gorter, and Page who started Friday, Topping and Mallalratt who played (
regularly until forced out by injuries and sickness, and Anderson, Lindsey, |
Bost, and Nobs, all of whom saw considerable action.
FROSH STRENGTH "
In addition, one of the strongest freshman quintets in several years hai
just finished a highly successful season in which only two games were lost j
and which was climaxed by three straight victories over the California
Babes.
It is always dangerous to count on inexperienced sophomores, but if
such men as Moore, Turner, Smith, Quade, and Schott develop as they
should, they will add much strength to the squad. Don Greenlee, center on
the frosh squad of last year, which also swept its series with the Bear Cubs,
was ineligible this season but will be ready for service next year.
THAT HIGHFLYER MARTY
V Walter Marty had those springs in his legs well oiled again Saturday
night and he sailed to another new world's high jump mark for the second
time in a week.
The Saturday before he broke his own record by leaping f» feet 8-%
inches, a mark which will go up for consideration as an official world's
record.
Saturday night at Madison Square Garden he soared 0 feet 8 7 s inches,
but unfortunately it will not be accepted as an official record because he
made it on his fourth attempt. —Tremaine 1
