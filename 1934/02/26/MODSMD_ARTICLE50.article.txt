# CARDS BEAT BEARS, 4 TO 1, IN OVERTIME WATER POLO GAME TO TAKE COAST TITLE
## 
### 
Showing loads of endurance and
an irrepressible burst in six over
time minutes, Stanford's varsity
water polo term defeated California
in the Encina pool here Saturday
afternoon, 4 to 1, to claim the Pa
cific Coast Intercollegiate champion
ship.
The Stanford frosh opened the day
with a close 5 to 4 victory.' Both
teams completed their seasons with
i
undefeated records, and each was ;
accredited with eight straight victo
ries in the Northern California
Water Polo League.
Little Scoring Done
The varsity clash was uneventful
from an offensive standpoint. Cali
fornia scored one goal in the first
half, Stanford tallied once in the I
second period, and the first overtime
session was a blank as far as points
were conccrned.
It was in the second three minutes 1
of extra play that Paul de Silva and
Bob Foster, forwards, began to func
tion offensively for Coach Nort
Thornton's championship Indians.
With two California men and one
Cardinal player having fouled them
selves out of the pool, de Silva broke
the deadlock which had existed early t
in the second half and gave the In
dians a 2-1 lead.

Then Foster took a tip shot from J
de Silva ind slipped it into the cage, j
Foster scored again a few moments i
later.
The work of Foster both offensively j
and defensively was outstanding, as
was Leo Cook's goal tending. Cap- J
tain Gordy Graves, playing his last j
game, showed a bit of clever guard- |
ing that kept the California captain.
Boynton Kaiser, bottled up.
Peterson Stars
With Don Peterson, heretofore un
presumptious guard, stealing the.
show by scoring four goals and com- ,
ing through defensively, the Indian |
frosh came from behind to nose out
a distinctly threatening Bear Cub
team.

No intersectional games will be
played by the West Virginia Univer
