# Indian Ruggers Trounce Bears; Ready For "Reps"
## Reisner Scores Two Tries For Stanford Victory 
### 
Stanford won another "Big Game"
Saturday, when the red-shirted
rugby team ran away from the Cali
fornians in the last half to send
Johnny Reisner scampering across
the goal line twice to win 13-0. Ray
Lewis converted Reisner's pair oi
tries and added a penalty kick from
the U.C. 10-yard line late in the
game for Ihe odd 3 points.
The Stanford forwards outplayed
their opponents throughout the en
tire game, but during the first half
a perverse Bear defense kept Ihe
Card backs bottled up, time and
ago in blocking off their rushing
passes.
Penetrate Twice
Only twice did the Bears pene
ti-ate Stanford territory, once on a
long kick by Jack Angelman that
found touch on the Stanford 1-yard
line, and again on a sweeping run
down the sideline by the same man
lhat was stopped when Frank Alu
stiza. Card fullback, artfully blocked
him out.
In the second half the Stanford
backs began functioning, working
the ball out to right wing Reisner,
who did some fancy stepping down
the sidelines to score. Twice the ball
came smoothly out from Chuck
White to Ray Lewis to Joe Vigna to
Reisner. The latter took a nice pass
from Vigna once on the California
40-yard line, and again later on the
10. scoring nicely from both posi
tions.
Lewis Kicks Goal
Ray Lewis brought his goal kick
ing average up to 28 good ones out
of 34 attempts.
Ron Collier, second five, and Miles
Hudson, wing forward, both mem
bers of the Stanford-California com
bined international team, looked
good for Ihe Bears.
Coach Eddie Graff of the Bears
told the Stanford men after the game
that it was absolutely the cleanest
and best spirited contest of the sea
son. "I would like to congratulate
players from both schools for their
attitude toward the game. I am
sorry to lose, but I enjoyed every
minute of it."
