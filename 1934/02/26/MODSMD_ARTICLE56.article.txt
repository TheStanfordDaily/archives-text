# Durand Gives Speech Over KPO Tonight
## 
### 
One of the world's greatest author
ities on the principles of aerodyna
mics, William F. Durand, professor- 1
emeritus of mechanical engineering
at the University, is to be the speaker
on tonight's edition of the Stanford j
University Hour, presented over ra
dio station KPO at 7:45 o'clock.
Dr. Durand, member of the Na
tional Advisory Committee on Aer
onautics from its inception in 1915
until his recent resignation, believes
that the 'rend of aviation in recent
years has been toward greater safety
and reliability, higher speed, greater
economy of operation, and greater •
comfort and convenience for the tra
veling public.
He believes implicitly in the pro
gress of air transportation and is em
phatic in calling attention to the need
for further research. Better know
ledge of structure, materials, safety
fuels, and radio communications
should prove a challenge to students
of aviation, says Di*. Durand.
Since his retirement from active
teaching responsibilities in 1928, Dr.
Durand has been engaged in editing
a work on aeronautics for the Gug
genheim Foundation. The work is to
consist of six volumes under the title
"Aerodynamic Theory—A Review of
Recent Progress in Aeronautics" and
the final page proofs on the first vol
ume have recently been mailed to
the publishers, Springer and Com
pany of Berlin.
These volumes, intended to mark
a milestone in aviation research,
gather together all of the fundamen
tal aerodynamic principles estab
lished to date and provide a "jump
ing off place" from which further re
search in that field can proceed. They
are a collection of the works of the 1
world's foremost authorities on avi- i
ation, and are a pari of the contri
bution to progress made under the
Guggenheim Foundation for the Pro
motion of Aei'onautics.
