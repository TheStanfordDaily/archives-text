WASHINGTON, Feb. 25 (UP).—
The army, ruffled by its "defenders"
in Congress, is going to defend its
ability to carry th™ mails.
Maj.-Gen. Benjamin D. Foulois,
chief of the army air corps, will ad
dress the nation tomorrow with an
account of the army's mail job and
how it is being carried out.
Army sympathizers pointed out
tonight that Republicans who have
chargcd in both Houses that the Ad
ministration was sending pilots help
lessly to their deaths reflect seriously
upon the army's general ability.
The contention that army equip
ment is not suited to airmail flying
has some merit, it is conceded, but
the troopers don't cure for the impli
cation that the army isn't capable of
c: straight flying job.

"Love and marriage" lectures for
students interested in such pursuits j
are offered at (he University of Ore
gon.
