## Nathan van Patten Issues New Reference Book 
### 
Filling a need felt by scholars in
the field of American and English
literature, an Index to Bibliographies
compiled by Nathan van Patten, di
rector of the Stanford Libraries, was
released by the University Press
yesterday.
The full title of the volume is "An
Index to Bibliographies and Bib-
Ikgraphical Contributions Relating
to the Work of American and Brit
is Authors, 1923-1932."
nus index has been planned as a
reference book which will facilitate
the finding of data concerning print
ed manuscript works of these writ
ers. No other single source of infor
mation covering this field during the
last decade is available, although the
need for such a work has been
pointed out.
Bibliographical contributions re
lating to first editions, typography,
points, rarity, and location have been
included. A valuable feature is the
indexing of many facsimiles of title
pages.
Important bio-bibliographies re
lating to individuals of other than
literary fame, Cromwell, Lincoln,
and Washington, although not strict
ly within the scope of the index,
have been included.
