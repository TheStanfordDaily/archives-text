# DURAND TALKS ON AVIATION IN STANFORD HOUR
## Aviation Expert Urges New Research in Structure And Material 
### 
Recent advances in aviation,
though great, are only a stage in the
development of air transportation,
and the way is still open for further
important advance. - ; in me field of
aero-dynamics, according to Wil
liaiYi F. Durand, prafessor-emeritus
of mechanical engineering, who last
night spoke on the Stanford Univer
sity Hour ever radio station KPO.
"Better knowledge is still needed
concerning the complex structure of
aircraft under the strains of unusual
and accidental conditions," stated
Durand, "including <he development
of new materials which will give
adequate strength with a saving of
weight."
Accidental Hazards
Professor Durand recommends
wiser and better combinations of
the factors which guard against haz
ards such as accidental conditions
met near the ground when the pilot
has insufficient room to bring his
plane under control.
The use of gasoline as fuel is an
other element of danger in which
high efficiency and fire hazard seem
to go hand in hand, continued Dr.
Durand. If people were willing to
sacrifice a little in the matter of high
speed and efficiency of overall op
eration, the possibility of using a
safety fuel would be a great deal
closex - .
Perils of blind flying can be still
further eliminated by the perfection
of radio guidance of planes, while the
weather service might be improved
by a better understanding of condi
tions determining the meteorological
status of all lanes commonly used m
air transpo/t, went on Dr. Durand.
"Lusty Infant"
"Air transport is a lusty infant
making its way strongly in a domain
of human activity in competition
with other agencies and under con
ditions which demand the largest
possible guarantees of safety, relia
bility, and efficiency," said Profes
sor Durand. "Here, as elsewhere,
only constant study, pitiless self
criticism, and continued advance in
all of the major requirements will
meet the expectations of the public
which the air-transport seeks to
serve."
