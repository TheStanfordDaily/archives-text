# Assembly Hall Faults Scored By Helvenston
## Drama Head Adds Criticism To Improvement Plan 
### 
Yesterday's statement by Comp
troller Almon E. Roth regarding pos
sible Assembly Hall revision incited
much campus comment, many sug
gestions regarding possible improve
ments. Dramatic Director Harold
Helvenston, probably the best au
thority on needs o£ the Hull, last
night stressed the major deficiencies
of the structure as it now exists.
"In the first place," he points out,
"no modern theatre should be fan
shaped. This type of construction
was planned ostensibly to be deco
rative. It is, however, only decora
tive in blue-print, and seriously at
fault as regards visibility.
Tells Proper Plan
"A good seating arrangement
should be an elongation of the stage
Itself, with each sea: affording an ad
vantageous vision of the entire
stage."
Another possible drawback of the
present hall is the dome, automati
cally eliminating matinee perform
ances because of the need for dark
ness. Furthermore, Helvenston ex
plains, skylights ar? a possible source
of danger in case of earthquake.
The dramatic head stressed espe
cially the need for on the
stage. A good theatre should first of
all supply comfortable seating ar
rangements for the audience, -ind
secondly a stage which will display
the performance to best advantage.
The stage of the Assembly Hall at
present is so high that the audience
has no view of the players' shoes."
Storage Lacking
He added that the only space now
available for storing scenery is two
small rooms accessible by low do*>rs,
which makes it a virtual impov.'-
bility to "strike" scenery into tie
storage spaces. A permanent i J
safe light bridge to replace the rick
ety wooden apparatus now in service
he also considers advisable. '
Recognizing the faults of the As
sembly Hall now in use, and the in
adequacy of financial backing, Hel
venston concludes that an effort to
make all seats good removing
those with poor acoustics and visi
bility, would result in a structure
infinitely more satisfactoiy to Stan
ford audiences.
