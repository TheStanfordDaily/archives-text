## Women Will Elect A.S.S.U. Vice-President Under New Government 
### Frank Orr 
After reviewing conflicting major
[ ity and minority reports from wom-
I en's Jiving groups, the Constitutional
| Revision Committee last evening
I adopted a compromise plan for the
! organization of the central A.S.S.U.
1 government under the new consti
j tution.
The consensus indicated co-ed liv—
| ing units' votes was that a woman
■ vice-president was desirable, and
I that she should be elected by women
; alone and still have a vote on the Ex
Committee. A combination of Plans
1 and 4 was seen as the most logical
j conclusion, and v/ilI be included in
J the new document when it is sub
j mitted to an election early next
j quarter.
Women Eliminated
In eliminating the sophomore
woman member of Ex Committee,
- the committee planned instead a
j woman's vice-president to be elected
j by a feminine vote as the A.S.S.U.
! second officer.
; The woman's vice-president will
have a vote on the committee but
1 will not be eligible to succeed to the
I chair in 'he event the president be-
I comes disqualified, nor will she pre-
I side in his absence. The provision
j for the A.S.S.U. president will be
i that he be a man.
Graduate Presides
Presiding in the president's ab
j scnce will be the graduate member
of the committee, who may be either
a man or h woman.
All Ex Committee members v. ill be
elected at large under the new sys
j tem with the exception of the wom
j an's vice-president, who will also act
; as chairman of the Women's Confer-
I ence. This arrangemeni will ma!£e
her in effect A.S.S.U. vice-president,
| except that .she may not preside.
