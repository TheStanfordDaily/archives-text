# Why Follow the Bears?
## 
### 
Brick Morse, writing for several thousand Northern
California readers, brings np the question "How about
1.(1.t-A.?" as regards the t'niversity of California track
outfit this year. The same arguments advanced for the
Bears might very well be duplicated right here on the
Farm, where the news has come forth that Stanford may
not be. playing with the boys in the East this year.
"California," Brick complains, "did not send a team
lo the 1.C.1-A. meet last year. More's the pity. It was a
great mistake." He goes on to show that, as long as U.S.C.
and I.C.L.A. are entering the 193-1 competition, Cal would
be very cagey to get back in the running this spring. His
prediction is that the Bears "with a lot of luck, could score
3;"> points this year."
In I.C. l-A. ratings, 35 points will put a squad right in
the money for a possible second or third spot in the final
standings. Less points have frequently won the event. So
when we consider the fact that Stanford has a pretty able
bunch of track aces right here at home and is about to
forego the pleasure of doing anything about it, we can
readily sympathize with Blue and Gold track fans.
Dink Templeton says that Stanford, with nine men, can
garner 3(i points in this year's meet at Philadelphia. Dink
should know, and he guesses .'Mi as a conservative figure. If
Stanford is fairly sure of these digits, and Cal boasts of 35,
it ought to be a good idea for both to enter and show the
Mast what the West has to offer.
The Board of Athletic Control says "no dough, no go,"
and the situation has stood at that point for some lime.
Skul! and Snakes, newly awakened men's honor society,
meets the challenge with an announced varsity-alumni
meet scheduled early next month. Proceeds will be placed
in a fund to send a squad to Philadelphia. That's the kind
of initiative that Stanford wants lo see.
But if Skull and Snakes shouldn't quite raise the neces
sary stipend a lot of people hereabouts would be inter
ested in having the B.A.C. reconsider the proposition. If
it came to the last straw, the A.S.S.I". might even be able
lo chip in if nothing else showed up.
In other words, Stanford is slill interested in the 1.C.1-A.

prediction is that the Bears "with a lot of luck, could score
3;"> points this year."
In I.C. l-A. ratings, 35 points will put a squad right in
the money for a possible second or third spot in the final
standings. Less points have frequently won the event. So
when we consider the fact that Stanford has a pretty able
bunch of track aces right here at home and is about to
forego the pleasure of doing anything about it, we can
readily sympathize with Blue and Gold track fans.
Dink Templeton says that Stanford, with nine men, can
garner 3(i points in this year's meet at Philadelphia. Dink
should know, and he guesses .'Mi as a conservative figure. If
Stanford is fairly sure of these digits, and Cal boasts of 35,
it ought to be a good idea for both to enter and show the
Mast what the West has to offer.
The Board of Athletic Control says "no dough, no go,"
and the situation has stood at that point for some lime.
Skul! and Snakes, newly awakened men's honor society,
meets the challenge with an announced varsity-alumni
meet scheduled early next month. Proceeds will be placed
in a fund to send a squad to Philadelphia. That's the kind
of initiative that Stanford wants lo see.
But if Skull and Snakes shouldn't quite raise the neces
sary stipend a lot of people hereabouts would be inter
ested in having the B.A.C. reconsider the proposition. If
it came to the last straw, the A.S.S.I". might even be able
lo chip in if nothing else showed up.
In other words, Stanford is slill interested in the 1.C.1-A.
Brick Morse, writing for several thousand Northern
California readers, brings np the question "How about
1.(1.t-A.?" as regards the t'niversity of California track
outfit this year. The same arguments advanced for the
Bears might very well be duplicated right here on the
Farm, where the news has come forth that Stanford may
not be. playing with the boys in the East this year.
"California," Brick complains, "did not send a team
lo the 1.C.1-A. meet last year. More's the pity. It was a
great mistake." He goes on to show that, as long as U.S.C.
and I.C.L.A. are entering the 193-1 competition, Cal would
be very cagey to get back in the running this spring. His
prediction is that the Bears "with a lot of luck, could score
3;"> points this year."
