For more than a decade, llie Peninsula Stanford
Women's Club, working almost entirely for campus stu
dents, has tried to make the women's elnhliousc a place
where roughs and coeds can gather to enjoy themselves.
Its altruism lias brought about good things, improvements
which otherwise never would have been made.
Tomorrow the club stages its one benefit function of the
year, a bridge lea by which it hopes to collect some pro
ceeds lo apply on the debt incurred to furnish the second
Moor of the building.
Students, not unmindful of what is being done quietly
lor them, can show their appreciation by being among
those present at this event.
