## IS PROSPERITY HERE? 
### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
Trying to answer this question a
! year ago would have been like try-
I ing to find how far is up. Now, when
jwe compare this year with last,
j things look better, so we feel more
i prosperous. You see, PROSPERITY
is mo.?lly a relative matter. So let's
J see how much better off we are now
| than last March 4th.
A year ago, all ih<? banks in the
| country were closed. Most of them
! are open now. That's a big improve
ment. About 10 per cent of Ihe coun
try's bank deposits wont up in smoke
during and before the bank holiday
last year; this money hasn't been re
placed. That's not so good. The im
portant thing, however, is how strong
i are our banks today?
| Banking is built on confidence. A
j year ago, many people thought ( he
banks would fail, so they hollered
for their money. This year hardly
anyone thinks the banks will close,
but the bankers have not forgotten
lust February; they are still pretty
| cautious. But, anyway, the banks
| are much stronger; people trust
j them.
Prices Are Rising
The main object of the New Deal
| is to raise prices to where they were 1
in 1920. A year ago, they were only |
| half as high as in 1926. Today they
are about three-quarters as high, |
j and have been climbing steadily.
But this is not the whoie picture.
Averages are misleading. The farm
ers were the worst off of the whole!
j lot. Last year they paid 1926 prices
for what they bought, got much less
j than (he average 1932 prices for what
they sold. This year, they are bet
! tor off. Prices of the things the
farmer sells have already doubled—
I and this happened by last July. After J
that the NRA made manufactured ;
goods prices rise very fast, so the j
farmer isn't as well off as he was last j
summer, but he is still a lot better \
off than he was last March. The I
same goes for the rest of us.
There are about 45 million work- !
ers in the United States. Nearly 16 )
million of them had no jobs at all last
March. Six million more were mak
ing only a few dollars a week. Today
there are about 11 million unem- I
ployed. The CWA is temporarily ;
employing around four million of j
them. All these men will lose their
CWA jobs by May 1, though.
Even if 1929 prosperity came back, ;
there would still be three million j
unemployed; machines have become
much more efficient. Apparently un
employment will be with us for a |
long time. Those who have jobs are j
better off than last year. Their j
wages have gone up faster than the J
prices of what they buy. But the I
latter, boosted by NRA, are catching !
up, which doesn't help a bit.
Business Is Much Better
There are two kinds of business: j
those which sell to the consumer, |
and those selling to the producer.
The former usually do fairly well in
a depression; the latter have a very |
hard time, as they are hit first and I
recover last. At present steel and ■
coal (producers) are improving very
gradually, but have a long way to
go. There ere very encouraging signs |
though: almost twice as many auto- \
mobiles were sold last year as :'n i
1932; a lot more will be sold this )
year. All of which will help the pro- |
ducers' industries. And, finally, sta
tistics show that business is 20 per
cent better than last March, or, ac
cording to F.R., HALF-WAY BACK
TO NORMAL.
That elusive animrl, PROSPER
ITY, is apparently just poking its
head around the well-known corner. I
It is a little bit dazzled by all the
New Deal whatnots, and may be i
scared away for a time. But when
it does come, it may stay longer.
Anyway, the U.S. is about one-third '
of the way out of the depression, as j
compared with last Febtuary. And !
most everyone is confident that pros- '
perity is leturning. That's half the |
battle.
