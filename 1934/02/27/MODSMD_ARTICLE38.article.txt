### Dashiell Hammett 
(Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1934)
That this book has been acclaimed
by Alexander Woollcott and others
as a master thriller is indeed a sad
commentary on the present state oi
the art of mystery thrillers. In real
ity, it is a noteworthy compilation of
Hemingway - five - word - sentences
detailing, without exception, every
irrelevant incident of a somewhat
prosaic week's sojourn in New York.
The story is the startlingly new
one about the ex-detective who re
turns to ihe scene cf his earlier tri
umphs for a visit. He is drawn into
a murder case involving many of his
old associates, and although the reg
ular police are baffled (imagine!), by
gawd, the boy solves it.
What distinguished this from other
books of the same ilk is that the au
thor uses his own new (for detective
stories) device of minutely detailed
realism. The leader is told what the
radio played whenever »t was on,

when "I" said, "she" said, "Noia" J
said, etcetera. The story is actually
incidental to the incidentals, which, 1
of course, is where such a hack
neyed plot belongs.
It is evidently the author's inten
tion that the book be devoid of sus
pense. He succeeds admirably. It is
difficult to reconcile this fact with
statements that this is America's
greatest thriller.
The realism is delightful in many
places, and the book could be cut up
into eight or ten highly entertaining
short glimpses of realism to great
advantage. But—this style of real- i
ism is not suited to the detective
thriller. It. is too tedious.
