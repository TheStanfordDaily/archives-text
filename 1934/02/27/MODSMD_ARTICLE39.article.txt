# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
[ It was heartening to note the de
rision with which many students
i greeted the odious spectacle that pa-
I raded around the campus yesterday.
A tank, i.e., a machine behind which
: cowards hide while committing mui -
j der, seems to be out of place on a
I campus which is soon to receive the
j FIDAC peace award. The military
ball might better be advertised by
; carrying a couple of stiffs from tlie
| medical labs around the campus. 1
J suggest that the decorations for the
i military ball be exclusively yellow
—and a yard wide.
Admittedly, wars are. necessary
under capitalism, but why show any
i respect for our paid gladiators? Gar
| bagemen and hangmen are also nec
; essary; why don't Stanford co-eds
i go to South San Francisco to lend
1 charm to the Garbagemen's Ball?
Professional soldiers have entered
, a dirty profession of their own free
will. They are looked upon as crim
i inals by civilized people: a murderer
is no less a murderer because he
kills in large numbers and to the
I sound of bugles. Why a dance for
! people who are not respectable?
i They should simply be considered an
j "untouchable" lower castc.
