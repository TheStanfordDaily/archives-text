The rugby team is divided into
two groups of players, witn diversi
fied duties loughly corresponding to j
(he line and'the backfield ir Ameri
can football. Usually the rugby
backfield is composed of seven men
and the forwards, or "scrum' ol 1
eight. _ |
And the general idea is that the
forwards retrieve the ball and send j
it hack to their backfield who start
a passing rush up the field. Hut
this is only a very general and
hazy idea of the scrum's duties.
Often they start a passing rush
among themselves, or, what may
even more effective, a dribbling
rush in which three or four big
forwards dribble the "hall along 1
with their feet.
The forwards must have weight
and power somewhere in the scrum,
although not all ol' them need be J
giants. The backfield is selected on j
their speed and ability to handle the
ball, which means passing and kick
ing.
The names of players' positions
are derived from their formation in
the scrum when they line up, and
although each man has a technical
name, it suffices that we accept the
common terminology used in this
vicinity. Stanford uses what is ,
called the three-four scrum and
they assemble somewhat as fol
lows:

The rugby team is divided into
two groups of players, witn diversi
fied duties loughly corresponding to j
(he line and'the backfield ir Ameri
can football. Usually the rugby
backfield is composed of seven men
and the forwards, or "scrum' ol 1
eight. _ |
And the general idea is that the
forwards retrieve the ball and send j
it hack to their backfield who start
a passing rush up the field. Hut
this is only a very general and
hazy idea of the scrum's duties.
Often they start a passing rush
among themselves, or, what may
even more effective, a dribbling
rush in which three or four big
forwards dribble the "hall along 1
with their feet.
The forwards must have weight
and power somewhere in the scrum,
although not all ol' them need be J
giants. The backfield is selected on j
their speed and ability to handle the
ball, which means passing and kick
ing.
The names of players' positions
are derived from their formation in
the scrum when they line up, and
although each man has a technical
name, it suffices that we accept the
common terminology used in this
vicinity. Stanford uses what is ,
called the three-four scrum and
they assemble somewhat as fol
lows:

the breakaways and the rear rankers
