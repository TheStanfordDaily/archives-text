INDIANS MAY GO
! TO 1.C.4A AFTER ALL
Apparently balked by the B.A.C.
j edict that sufficient funds were lack
ing to send them to the I.C.A.A.A.A.
' meet this year, Stanford trackmen,
| through the medium of Skull and
j Snakes, men's honorary society, are
! apparently taking matters into their
i own hands in an attempt to raise
1 money enough to send a team East.
U.S.C. and California have both
1 announced that they will be unable
i to send teems to the meet, although
it is said movements are under way
at both schools to raise the money.
It seems j pity that the West may not
be represented this year, for either
Stanford or U.S.C. has won the meet
every year since their entrance with
' the exception of one season when
j Yale took lop honors. i
The first move in *he campaign to
! send the Indians East for the meet
! which comes late in May, is the var
| sity-alumni encounter planned by
; Skull and Snakes, which is carded
! for March 10. The affair should fur
| nish some top-notch performances,
' foi many ex-Indian stars are train
| i:ig for a season with various club
I teams should be in fine shape.
: Among them will be Ben Eastman,
. Bill Miller, Abe Hables, Here La-
I horde, and Norman Bright.
BASEBALL LOSES
COLORFUL LEADER
Baseball lost one of jtr greatest
! and most colorful figures when John
j McGraw, former manager of the New
j York Giants, passed away Sunday
i morning. McGraw, always a fiery
athlete, carried his tactics over to his
j managerial duties and for years was
i one of the outstanding names in the
: National League.
i Af a player he was n star for many
j years and then reached the peak of
I managerial success, being rated with
I Connie Mack as one of the two great
-1 est leaders the game has seen. His
j name was synonymous with base
-1 ball, and his loss is a great one.
