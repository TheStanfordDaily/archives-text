# INDIAN TRACKMEN WORKING OUT FOR UNIVERSITY MEET
## 
### 
"On to Philadelphia."
That is the slogan as Stanford
track stars, past and future, prepare
for an all-University track and field
meet March 10, under guidance of
Skull and Snakes, men's honorary
athletic society.
The meet will be for the purpose
of raising funds to send a 10-man
Cardinal team to the ICAAAA meet
May 25 and 20 in Philadelphia.
Squad Is Strong
The Card squad, smattored will)
stars, will put up a better showing in
a big meet lhan they will in dual
meets, and Indians are conceded
p good chance of winning the Inter
collegiates if necessary funds, esti
mated at $3,000, can be gathered to
gether.
The all-University meet, a strug
gle between living groups, will be
more than an intra-mural engage
ment. The full strength of this year's
team will be augmented by some oi
the most prominent Card athletes in
several years.
Among the duels that will ensue
are several that will be seen only in
the all-University affair. Ben East
man, world's record quarter miler,
will compete with A1 Blackman,
probably for the only time this sea
son, since Eastman may limit his fu
ture activities to the half-mile.
Evenly Matched Races
Other races that seem to be toss
ups at the present reading are those
between Norman Bright and Chuck
Nimmo in the mile; Bill Miller and
Bud Deacon in the peie vault; Cotto
Herbert and Captain Gus Meier in
the hurdles, and Abe Hables and
Carlton Thcins in the sprints.
The meet, which in many respects
will be the best on Ihe Stanford oval
this year, will bear a Si admission
charge for the general public. The
charge for students will be 50 cents.
