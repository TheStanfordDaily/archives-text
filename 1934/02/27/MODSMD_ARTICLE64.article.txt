## 
### 
The strong arm of the law took
advantage of a rarely offered oppor
tunity to exert its pressure over the
army yesterday afternoon when Of
ficer Gordon Davis, single-handed,
stopped the lumbering progress of
the army tank, parading the campus
to advertise the Military Ball being
held Friday night >n the Women's
Gym.
The heavy steel doors of the tank
opened, and from its depths emerged
Nat KendaJl, to confront the smiling
face of Gordon Davis in an effort to
discover the reason of his enforced
halt. With a slight admonition io
stop blocking traffic, the victorious
officer of the law allowed the van
quished tank to continue its slow,
steady course.
Perhaps the fact that Gordon Da
vis yave no ticket indicated a short
age of traffic tickets as great as that
ci bids for the Military Ball, as only
a very few of the latter remain on
sale at the A.S.S.U. office. In order
to avoid disappointment, Kendall ad
vised that those who plan to attend
'.he Ball buy their bids immediately.
