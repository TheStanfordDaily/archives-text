fourteenth annual congress in Mo
rocco last year, made three awards
to American colleges and universi
ties for promoting the cause of world
peace. The first of Ihese went to
Minnesota, as an institution of over
1,000; the second went to Delaware,
as one of under 1,000; and the third
to Stanford as the school, regardless
of its size, which did the most to
"promote peace and good will in the
Far East."
Composed of 8,000,000 members at
present, the FIDAC was organized
in Paris in 1920, and includes 60 vet
erans' organizations in 30 allied
countries. The American Legion is
the only organization in the country
connected with it. Conferences are
held in each of the allied countries m
turn, with the object of "reviewing
impartially problems to be solved by
different countries, to remove fric
tion between allied nations, and to
contribute to a permanent world
peace."
Faculty Interest •
Stanford's interest in the Far East,
and that which has brought this
medal to the University, is due
largely to the work of Professors
Payson Treat and Yamato Ichihashi
of the History Department, to the
active service of many of the faculty
on the Insi.itutc of Pacific Relations,
and to the extensive collections made
in this field by the Hoover War Li
brary.
In the Hoover Library cases there
are at present displayed official
World War records of the A.E.F.,
various other war publications, in
formation on the FIDAC, while a
space for the medal itself is being
reserved for its display after its
presentation today.

Faculty Interest •
Stanford's interest in the Far East,
and that which has brought this
medal to the University, is due
largely to the work of Professors
Payson Treat and Yamato Ichihashi
of the History Department, to the
active service of many of the faculty
on the Insi.itutc of Pacific Relations,
and to the extensive collections made
in this field by the Hoover War Li
brary.
In the Hoover Library cases there
are at present displayed official
World War records of the A.E.F.,
various other war publications, in
formation on the FIDAC, while a
space for the medal itself is being
reserved for its display after its
presentation today.

rocco last year, made three awards
to American colleges and universi
ties for promoting the cause of world
peace. The first of Ihese went to
Minnesota, as an institution of over
1,000; the second went to Delaware,
as one of under 1,000; and the third
to Stanford as the school, regardless
of its size, which did the most to
"promote peace and good will in the
Far East."
Composed of 8,000,000 members at
present, the FIDAC was organized
in Paris in 1920, and includes 60 vet
erans' organizations in 30 allied
countries. The American Legion is
the only organization in the country
connected with it. Conferences are
held in each of the allied countries m
turn, with the object of "reviewing
impartially problems to be solved by
different countries, to remove fric
tion between allied nations, and to
contribute to a permanent world
peace."
