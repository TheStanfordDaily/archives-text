Is a new theatre for Stanford a
possible attainment? Interest in this
problem has been revived by the an
nouncement by the administration
of plans to improve the present As
sembly Hall. Both criticism and ap
plause have met this statement of
policy.
Financial conditions preventing
extra expenditures have been the
postponing factor in the Assembly
Hall improvement and are the pro
hibitive factors against a donation
to the Theatre Fund, it has been an
nounced.
Comptroller Ahnon E. Roth an
nounces now that actual rejuvena

tion of the Assembly Hall will begin
this summer with the replacement
of 500 of the present seats with new
ones.
The question has immediately been
raised by students as lo why the mo
ney to be used for this purpose could
not be turned into the theatre fund
for the erection of a truly modern
auditorium with proper stage faci
lities, a proper seating arrangement,
and better aceoustics.
The Theatre Fund which totalled
over $4300 last year is now increased
to at least $4500.
The Stanford War Memorial Fund
which is now in the hands of the
University has far surpassed the
$150,000 mark. Most recent estimates
of the cost to build a new theatre
approximate $150,000.
Is there an answer to the problem
here?
