# Tomorrow Set as Last Chance to Order Quads
## 
### 
From 8 o'clock until noon today, a
Quad salesman will be stationed at
the Engineering corner to receive
money for yearbook installments.
Manager Hal Whitfield has made
tomorrow the deadline for first in
stallments. Th< i two ways of paying
for 1934 Quads will be: general pay
ments, $2.50, and senior payments,
$3.
Last year, many who failed to pay
first installments and did not order
Quads early, were disappointed, for
the book sold out. Only a limited
number of copies will be printed this
year, .so those who wish to pay their
first installments, or still order the
Quad, may see the salesman at Engi
neering corner this morning.
