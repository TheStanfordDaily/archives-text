# STUDENTS GIVE $1000 TOWARD SCHOLARSHIPS
## Appropriations to Go To Trustees' Fund For Working Students HOOP LETTERS GIVEN Recipient's Need Is Only Criterion for Award 
### 
One thousand dollars, to be used
as foundation for a complete scholar
ship, was voted by the Ex Committee
last night to the Trustees' Fund for
Self-supporting Students.
Dr. Harry B. Reynolds, appointed
by President Wilbur to organize the
move for contributions, appeared be
fore the committee and told of the
purpose of the new fund, planned to
assist students in financial straits.
Grant $1,000
A motion followed a short discus
sion granted the $1,000, "with the
hope that future Executive Com
mittees may see fit to continue Ihe
donations." Members proposed that
the principal be untouched, and that
appropriations rrom future Ex Com
mittees be used to build up the fund.
The sole criterion to be used when
the University administers the new
scholarships, Dr. Reynolds said, will
be the need of the individual. The
sole regulation will be that the stu
dent maintain a C average while
benefiting from the fund.
Drive Begins
Last night's move on the Ex Com
mittee's part will form the starting
point for a canvass of friends and
