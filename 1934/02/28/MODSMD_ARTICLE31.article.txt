# The
						Drive Starts
## 
### 
The Executive Committee in its move to initiate the
Trustees' Student Loan Fund lias set an example which
should not only draw favorable comment among alumni
and Stanford friends but should make those individuals
think more seriously of digging down in their pockets and
helping some worthy student out of a difficulty which,
perhaps, befell many of those older people in their college
days.
Student Body President Jerry Trail I man and Manager
I,es fiablcs, in taking the matter in their hands at the sug
gestion of Dr. Harrv B. Reynolds, drive chairman, have
displayed their interests in current student problems. The
unanimous sentiment of the 4 Kx Committee that last night's
donation of $1000 should be carried on until a self-per
petuating scholarship has been established is a sound
move. Trautman and I tables presented economically logi
cal ideas, the committee concurred in their beliefs, and
today the loan fund drive is on its way.
Students have started the ball rolling. Alumni and
friends, who are able, will recognize the action of the
A.S.S.T. I'nder Doctor Reynolds' leadership, and with the
backing of the Board of Trustees, the fund should mount
rapidly.
