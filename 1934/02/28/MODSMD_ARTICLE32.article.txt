# Militarists on Parade
## 
### 
Next Friday night the boys from the local R.O.T.C. unit
hold their annual Military Ball. It's really a very militaris
tic affair, but not in just the way one might think.
Far from sloughing around in the mud after guns,
figuring out "problems" about how to "neutralize" this or
that machine gun nest, their interest is in things not so
"militaristic."
For them, it's a good chance to get away from the
squads right and left that Captain Miller dishes out and
they have to take, to wear their swankiest uniforms (cost
ing t'nele Sam upwards of a hundred dollars), and to duly
impress those certain co-eds with their importance as
cadets.
They're peace-loving souls, because if they fought, their
gold braid and Sam Brownes would get dirty and torn, and
their "problems" in the paved courtyard of the Women's
(ivm are those of love, which is no fairer than war.
