## NRA OVERHAUL? 
### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
Last fall a former cabinet member
stated that the Blue Eagle had failed
to lay any golden eggs. Yesterday
representatives from ali walks of life
met in Washington to see if it had. j
They had been summoned by NRA
Administrator Johnson, who believes i
in justifiable criticism of his pet bird, j
They were there because everyone i
admits that the NRA needs a thor- i
ough overhauling. But what is the
NRA? What has it done? What
hasn't it done?
What Is the NRA?
The idea behind the NRA is this:
our depressions are too frequent and
100 .severe; we can cushion the shock
of depression and prevent unhealthy
booms by carefully controlling the 1
economic forces which cause them. |
These are mainly the lack of balance j
between productive capacity and
mass buying power. The way to re- i
cover from depressions and main- ;
tain prosperity is to increase con
sumption faster than production. The j
only way to do this is for the gov
ernment to bring capital (employers)
and labor logether in a partnership.
This partnership is the NRA.
The method of the NRA was to
bring organized employers (trade j
associations) and organized labor
(labor unions) together with repre- |
sentatives of the consumers to dis
cuss the situation in each industry.
Then a code of fair competition for j
the industry was adopted. It usually
limited working hours to 40 a week,
fixed minimum wages for labor, out
lawed unfair trade practices such as j
cutthroat price-cutting, etc. Every |
industry of any size at all is now
operating under a code.
What Has it Done?
In evaluating the NRA, we have
to keep iwo things in mind: (1) has
mass buying power been increased? ,
(2) has overproduction been stopped? ;
To a certain extent, the NRA has |
done both of these things. It has in
creased employment. Two million
have been re-employcd as a result
of its operation. Total factory pay- i
rolls are per cent higher than
last March; the workers' wages will
buy a little more than they would
last March; hourly wages have gone
up, but weekly wages have gone
down a little. Which means that the
work has been spread around so that
more people are working fewer
hours.
Most industries are satisfied with
the NRA. By raising wages, it made
the weak sisters drop out; by out- J
Jawing price-cutting i f made more
profits.. So quite a few big industries
are pleased. But here's where the
trouble begins.
What it Has Not Done
Eventually higher wages, etc., will
mean higher prices. But wages per
man have increased hardly at all
lately; on the other hand, the cost of
living is going up rapidly. White
collar workers' salaries are still about
where they were a year Ego. Now
the consumers are beginning to howl.
They claim that the natural outcome
of no price-cutting is price-fixing by
industry, which means much higher
prices to ihe consumer, who will get
it in the neck. Many people feel
that the trade associations are rap
idly turning into trusts, and that
F.R. will have to do some trust bust
ing before he is through. Finally, it
is probably true that NRA will lower
mass buying power in the futureâ€”
unless something is done. This is
the purpose of the Wnshington gath
ering.
Probably NRA's worst mistake was
to promise too much too soon. Last
summer, everybody thought it would
end the depression in a month. When
it didn't, cosiness had a relapse. If
j the whole job had been undertaken

more carefully and systematically,
we might be better off now.
The NRA is here to ?tay. You can't
unscramble an omelet. It has made
changes in industry and labor which,
if carefully watched, may make fu
ture depressions shorter and more
pleasant. If it is not watched, we will
have bigger and better depressions in
the future.
