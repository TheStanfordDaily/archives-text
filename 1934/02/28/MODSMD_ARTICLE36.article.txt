THE BATTLE IS ON

The Editor, Sir:
Yesterday's paper indicates that
wc have a pacifist in our midst. And
such a vitriolic, pugnacious rascal
he is. I really believe he would
fight for peace.
Goodness gracious! What ogre.s
these R.O.T.C. boys are!
But why look down 011 them, Mr.
Malloch? After all, if they choose to
be the primary cannon fodder for
America, that is their privilege.
Isn't it stretching it a bit to call
these gentlemen (Malloch would ob
ject to this term) murderers and
criminals?
Perhaps it is unkind to disillusion
you any further, Mr. Malloch, but
somehow it seems doubtful that the
students were actually jeering the
military boys; they were probably
jeering the amusing publicity for the
Ball. —\V. A. Roberts
