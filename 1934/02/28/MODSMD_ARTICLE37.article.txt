The Editor, Sir:
This is but the feeble protest of
one student against the scandalous,
not to say outrageous, methods used
to advertise a dance, which we were
wont to consider one of the most dig
nified and conservative social func-

tions on the campus—.hat is, outside
of presidential receptions.
To think that my good friend, Nat
Kendall, and his committee have de
scended to the point of using a blat
snt pendant suspended from a win
dow on the Engineering corner and
to plastering all available spaces ,
with disgracefully arranged signs
was bad enough. But now the last
straw has come —the step of stark
sensationalism that crowns all previ
ous efforts in the lowest form of ad
vertising: the unbelievable fact that
Nat himself drove that tank.
Oh! the horror of it. But at least
we have the consolation that the !
tank, wheezy and old as it was, had |
a proper sense of its self-respect'
and dignity, for did it not balk and
strain to be back to its rightful rest
ing place every moment of its shame
ful exposure to the gaping mob? Who j
would have recognized a Stanford
group in that mob of open mouths?
What next? I am confidently ex
pecting a Military Ball sandwich
board at any moment. Can nothing
be done to prevent this last affront
to all feelings of decency?
Stanford students, TO ARMS.
(Figuratively speaking, of course—l
am a pacifist.) In all sincerity,
George Walker
