RICHELIEU. (Bulwar-Lytton; revi
. sion: Arthur Goodrich.)
At the Columbia Theatre
The hokum surrounding Bulwer-
Lytton's "Richelieu," which includes
a secret passage, numberless dark
plots, with—above all—the missing
papers, permits in many respects a
highly amusing evening in the thea- i
tre.
It is a play in the tradition of the
romantic melodrama and perhaps the
best example of genteel cape and
sword scurrying which the nine
teenth century affords.
Walter Hampden (with the aid of
Arthur Goodrich, who lus wisely re
moved redundant plo, complications) |
gives the play that production which
it merits and demands if modern au
diences are to accept it.
The Hampden Company, which
equals that of last year in all re
spects, has been trained in the acting '
tradition of the last century and its
stiff and conventionalized ges
tures and stage movements are emi
nently in keeping with the artifici
ality of the play itself. Mechanical ;
as this may be, it is still capable of j
arousing and holding an audience's
attention however baldly apparent
its methods may be.
Hampden shines in ihis sort of play j
and playing. He knows and employs :
liberally the tricks of theatrical ef
fect, not the least exciting of which
are his delay before the last speech
in the second act and his "curse" in
the third.
If the surrounding company is, in
almost all respects, of a low order,
this adds an evening in the theatre
enjoyable for its brash but consistent
artificiality.
The field of the romantic melo
drama of intrigue : s one in which
Hampden's talents are best viewed.
His magnificent voice, convulsed
with fury or thick with sentimental
reflection, and his command of the
standard tricks for gaining the ex
cited attention of an audience, are
admirably suited to this happily oc
casionally happy sort of play and
production. —Sandoe
