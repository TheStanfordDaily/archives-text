(Being one of a series of articles
describing the elements of rugby
football for the benefit of the unini
tiated.)
Trying to tie up a lot of loose ends
before the big rugby game Thursday,
we are obliged to make our space
count today, and wiil not have so
much room as we had hoped to ex
pand on phases of the play.
Continuing from our discussion of
the serum yesterday, we might .say
that it is the most frequent part of a
rugby game, and th< re are innu
merable occasions when one is, or
ought to be, called by the referee.
For instance, wheji a player with the
ball is smothered and can not drop
it, a scrum should be promptly called
by the referee. We won't toll any
more of the causes for scrums, but
take our word for it, the referee is
usually right.
Tin: LINEOUT
This is ine of the finest parts oi"
rugby and called when the ball has
gone out of bounds. One man stands
on the sidelines and tosses in the ball
to the other members ol the scrum
who are lined facing him, parallel
across the field.
The forwards jump for the pass
and either send it to their backfieiM,
put it at their feet and form an in
formal scrum, or take it with them
and attempt to form a dribbling rush.
PENALTIES
Probably the most frequent and
the most difficult penalty to under
stand is the ofiside rule, which we
think would take a small volume
properly to explain, in brief, when
a member of one team kicks the ba!i
all his teammates are offside, except
those between him and his own goal.
A player offside may not tackle an
opponent, or retrieve the ball until
he is put onsidi, which may be done
as follows:
a) By the player who kicked the
ball's running up the field to where
the ball has advanced.
b) By the ball's touching a mem
ber of the opposing team and being
fumbled.
c) By an opposing player's running
five yards v/ith the bali.
d) By being 10 yards away from
an opponent when he receives the
ball; the player may then rush in the
10 yards and tackle the receiver.
A player behind one of his team
mates who is carrying the ball is al
ways onside. As far as we know, the
above is correct, although "Dink"'
Templeton or Harry Maloney may
find loopholes in the statements. It
is sufficient, though, for the average
spectator.
Holding onto the bail after being
tackled, if the runner is free to drop
it, is a serious offense and is cause
for a penalty kick. The same applies
to picking he ball up with the hands
in a scrum. The latter is a favorite
trick of experienced front rankers,
and if the referee overlooks it, it
means trouble for the opposing
scrum.
Don't worry about ;.ny other pen
alties; we can think of no more at
the moment and if the referee calls
them, probably even the players
won't understand what they're for.
