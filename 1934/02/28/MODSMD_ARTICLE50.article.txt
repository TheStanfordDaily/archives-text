# CLEAN SWEEP OF CALIFORNIA SERIES CLOSES FROSH BASKETBALL TEAM'S WINNING SEASON
## 
### 
Eighteen wins out of twenty starts
and a clean sweep of the all-impor
tant series with the California frosh
j summarizes the winning season just
closed by Coach Jimmy Bradshaw
j and the yearling hoopsiers. Marring
the otherwise spotless record are two
j early season losses to Galileo High
j of San Francisco, by two field goals,
and to the Santa Clara Frosh by one
J point, defeats which comparative
score addicts can wipe out by means
of succeeding wins over S.F.U. Babes
' and the Cal frosh.
Opening the season was a barn
i storming trip to Bakersfield and
1 Watsonville, three easy wins. San
Francisco high schools were next in
i the schedule, and while Balboa and
, Lowell proved easy wins the Pa
| pooses dropped a tough one to Gal
ileo High, 34-30. Then followed the
Santa Clara 29-28 loss, which also
marked the starting point for and
unstoppable run of 13 straight wins.

Spread out among easy victories
over Commerce, Stockton, Salinas,
Fresno, Piedmont, and Mission high
schools, the St. Mary's frosh and
Menlo Junior College were high
class competition, and were only
licked after last-minute comebacks.
For the thriller of the season, frosh
hoopsters pick the 27-26 battle with
the Moraga Valley Babes, won in the
last, second by a pass half the length
of the court and a crashing set-up.
