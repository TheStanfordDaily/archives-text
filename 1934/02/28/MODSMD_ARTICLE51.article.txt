# Lagunita Filling; Water Flows as Canoeists Smile
## 
### 
Lake Lagunita, despite the
pessimistic predictions of the
past few weeks, may, after all,
be filled.
Ten thousand gallons of water
flowed into the lake Monday,
with every prospect that this
amount would be almost dupli
cated Tuesday and today.
The water continues to flow
in rapidly, and there are now
1)6,000,000 gallons of muddy
water slowly climbing up the
grassy banks of the lake. Com
pared io last year's total of 81,-
000,000 gallons at this date, this
amount may seem rather low,
but the present rapid inflow
lends a cheerful outlook to the
situation.
