# LEADERS SHOW FAVOR TOWARD WOMEN'S VOTE
## Men Approve Compromise On Co-ed Election Of Vice-President 
### Frank Orr 
General approval of the Women's
vice-president plan to be included in
the new A.S.S.U. constitution was
expressed yesterday when men's
leaders evidenced satisfaction with
the results of Monday night's vole
and subsequent compromise.
Demanded by a large majority at
Monday night's living group meet
ings, the vice-presidency will be held
by a woman, in contrast to the pres
ent system in which a man holds the
; office. She will be elected by a femi
nine vote and will possess a vote on
the Ex Committee, but will not have
! the power to preside. In adopting
J the plan, a compromise between two
' of the propositions offered for the
! women's vote, the Constitution Re
vision Committee eliminated the po
sition of sophomore woman member
!of Ex Committee as a balance of
i powers.
Like Combination
An optimistic attitude was also
I expressed by men leaders toward the
| proposed combination of A.W.S. with
A.S.S.U., most of them agreeing that
; the fusion of the two largest elements
IQt government wouJ i make for a
! smoother-running system.
Said Dick Van Wa*jenen, Men's
i Council member: "The idea of women
voting for the woman vice-president
j is a good one, but the chief advan
tage in the new plan is that by tying
in the women's government with the
A.S.S.U. there will bs less duplica
tion and a closer working scheme."
Millard Satisfied
A.W.S. President Jeanne Millard,
whose office becomes extinct if the
constitution is adopted approved the
I rew plan immediately on its adop
tion Monday night, saying, "the com
mittee, considering the wishes of va
rious factions, has reached a very
intelligent compromise. I hope it
meets with general approval."
Bill Morse, chairman of the Stu
dent Committee, said: "I think the
plan adopted by the committee con-
I cerning the women's vice-president
i is the logical and sensible answer to
J a difficult problem. This plan will
allow the women to choose their own
leader, and yet do away with the
distinct women's organization that
has existed in the past."

i powers.
Like Combination
An optimistic attitude was also
I expressed by men leaders toward the
| proposed combination of A.W.S. with
A.S.S.U., most of them agreeing that
; the fusion of the two largest elements
IQt government wouJ i make for a
! smoother-running system.
Said Dick Van Wa*jenen, Men's
i Council member: "The idea of women
voting for the woman vice-president
j is a good one, but the chief advan
tage in the new plan is that by tying
in the women's government with the
A.S.S.U. there will bs less duplica
tion and a closer working scheme."
Millard Satisfied
A.W.S. President Jeanne Millard,
whose office becomes extinct if the
constitution is adopted approved the
I rew plan immediately on its adop
tion Monday night, saying, "the com
mittee, considering the wishes of va
rious factions, has reached a very
intelligent compromise. I hope it
meets with general approval."
Bill Morse, chairman of the Stu
dent Committee, said: "I think the
plan adopted by the committee con-
I cerning the women's vice-president
i is the logical and sensible answer to
J a difficult problem. This plan will
allow the women to choose their own
leader, and yet do away with the
distinct women's organization that
has existed in the past."
