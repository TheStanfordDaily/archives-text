# CANADIAN REPS TO MEET CARD RUGGERS TODAY
## Addition of American Stars Strengthens Indian Chances for Win 
### Spud Hamilton 
For the first time in the umpty
ump yeans .sine*? 1912, this neck of
the woods wiil have the opportunity
today of watching real international
rugby play when Stanford goes
against the British Canadian "Reps"'
al 3:30 o'clock in the Stanford sta
dium.
And although affable Captain Tom
Roxburgh of the invaders grins be
hind his toothbrush moustache and
tells you that "we don't care about
winning; we just came down to play
the game," ihat doesn't mean that he
and his pack ol' ball hounds will not
be giving the Americans a merry
afternoon, -.villi both .sides straining
every muscle and pulsing out every
last bit of energy to hold the upper
hand at the finish.
Hope for Reserve
The Stanford team has an appre
ciably large sized bone of contention
to pick with the Canadian All-Stars,
as they played against the majority
of them during their four-game
Christmas trek through British Co
lumbia. From these very men, the
Indians, along with ten men from
California, took three hard drub
bings; tomorrow, they expect to see
a reversal of those verdicts.
Grid Stars Added
Stanford, and it is rumored, the
visitors themselves, feel that they
are the only club on Ihe schedule
that will furnish the "Reps" any op
position. "Sure, we lost to the blight
ers up there, - ' the Cardinals say,
"but there's been some changes
made. We didn't have Reisner, and
we didn't hava Palamountain, and
we didn't have Joe Vigna, Frank
Alustiza, nor Captain Chuck White,
either. And since Christmas time
we've been learning the game, beat
ing these 'earns in the rugby union."'
Stanford will start the following
team: Backs, Alustiza, Reisner,
Bansbach, Vigna, White, Ray Lewis,
and Cotton or Fuller. Forwards,
Hitchcock, Gill, Wyman, Ingersoll,
Mullin, Palamountain, Ray Lewis,
and Hager or Pinotti, or Tatum.
British Columbia: Backs, Fraser,
Rowe, Tergoose, Rose, Van Home,
Captain Roxburgh, Ono. Forwards,

hand at the finish.
Hope for Reserve
The Stanford team has an appre
ciably large sized bone of contention
to pick with the Canadian All-Stars,
as they played against the majority
of them during their four-game
Christmas trek through British Co
lumbia. From these very men, the
Indians, along with ten men from
California, took three hard drub
bings; tomorrow, they expect to see
a reversal of those verdicts.
Grid Stars Added
Stanford, and it is rumored, the
visitors themselves, feel that they
are the only club on Ihe schedule
that will furnish the "Reps" any op
position. "Sure, we lost to the blight
ers up there, - ' the Cardinals say,
"but there's been some changes
made. We didn't have Reisner, and
we didn't hava Palamountain, and
we didn't have Joe Vigna, Frank
Alustiza, nor Captain Chuck White,
either. And since Christmas time
we've been learning the game, beat
ing these 'earns in the rugby union."'
Stanford will start the following
team: Backs, Alustiza, Reisner,
Bansbach, Vigna, White, Ray Lewis,
and Cotton or Fuller. Forwards,
Hitchcock, Gill, Wyman, Ingersoll,
Mullin, Palamountain, Ray Lewis,
and Hager or Pinotti, or Tatum.
British Columbia: Backs, Fraser,
Rowe, Tergoose, Rose, Van Home,
Captain Roxburgh, Ono. Forwards,
Norminton, Sutherland. Moran, Bain,
Mitchell, Dyer, King, Doswell.
Admission is 25 cents to students
and 50 cents to the public, plus tax.
For the first time in the umpty
ump yeans .sine*? 1912, this neck of
the woods wiil have the opportunity
today of watching real international
rugby play when Stanford goes
against the British Canadian "Reps"'
al 3:30 o'clock in the Stanford sta
dium.
And although affable Captain Tom
Roxburgh of the invaders grins be
hind his toothbrush moustache and
tells you that "we don't care about
winning; we just came down to play
the game," ihat doesn't mean that he
and his pack ol' ball hounds will not
be giving the Americans a merry
afternoon, -.villi both .sides straining
every muscle and pulsing out every
last bit of energy to hold the upper
hand at the finish.
