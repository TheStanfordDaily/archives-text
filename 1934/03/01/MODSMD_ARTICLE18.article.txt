### Annalee Whitmore 
Deficiencies in the local Assembly
Hall are intensified by announcement
of a million dollar auditorium to be
constructed at the University of Cal
i ifornia. The structure, if present
; plans go through, would also include
a Little Theatre and museum facili
ties, to be built in the vicinity of
Bancroft Way and College Avenue.
Stanford's gathering , place has u
maximum capacity of 1,746, as com
pared to the contemplated 6,000 of
the U.C. auditorium. In blueprints
it also boasts a dome comparable to
that of the Roman Pantheon topping
its 130 feet in length.
The U.C. Little Theatre plans ap
proach perfection. Smaller in scale
than the adjacent auditorium, it
would possess an unsurpassed audi
tory system, which brings up the
fact that though dramatic activities
rtf the Farm are widely famed, no
Little Theatre proper exists on the
local campus.
