Committee on International Affairs
of the Legion reported that Stanford

university in work on Far Eastern
relations, as well as hoiking a first
lank position in the general field of
international relations.
''The American Legion desires
nothing more than the continuation
of peace," said Hayes, "and for this
reason has banded together with vet
erans from nine other allied coun
tries, to form the FIDAC, an organi
zation which strives for international
peace and friendship, and a preser
vation of (hat understanding reached
by the allies during the war.
Laziness Feared
"The thing the Le«ion fears the
most," he continued, "is not the in
surrection of the ignorant, but the
laziness of the intelligent. It is for
that reason we look to the university
student of today, in the hope of
stimulating a more aeiive interest in
a will to understand international
relations and good will such as has
been developed in a University such
as Stanford."
Commander Hayes also stressed in
his talk the importance of national

when "we can know that a real un

stand ready for any emergency."

here has made for much understand
ing. If we can meet on equal terms
with students of other nations in the
fields of education, science, and med
icinc, there is no reason why we

between students of international re
