uates in the Business World," at 7:15
o'clock tonight. All interested sen
iors, both men and women, are eligi
ble to attend.
The speech, to be held in Room 214
of the Administration Building, will
deal with the assets L o various types

some students will be benefited by
further university work and others,
merely wasting time.

as was previously planned, questions

night's meeting. The half-hour talk
to precede the open discussion will
be over in time for sports loving

ing matches.
