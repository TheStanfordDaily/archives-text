# COTTRELL GIVES STUDENT TALK
## 
### 
"A liberal education and why the
School of Social Sciences is best
adapted for obtaining it," was the
theme of Professor Edwin A. Cot
trell, executive head of the School of
Social Science, in giving the fifth
Wednesday evening department rrn
jor talk last night in the Little Trea
tre. j
"A student in the Social Science
School," stated Cottrcll, "is laying
a basic foundation for himself that
will serve him in any profession
or vocation. It is the specific ob
ject of the school to avoid speciali
zation and to stress study in a se
ries of related departments."
Cottrell explained to the group of
nearly 100 undergraduates assembled
Ihat in general the ether schools of
the University give a student a nar
row field of knowledge that makes
him wholly unfit to deal with the
broad scope of problems that will
confront him 111 later life.
Likening the School of Social Sci
ences to what in most universities is
known as the '"Liberal Arts College,'
Cottrell explained how social science
is vitally related to all the professions
and how it teaches a student to inter
prete facts rather than remember
them.
