The campus welcomed "Pop" War
ner back to the Farm with an ova
tion as he rose to say a few words

player who never quit trying to im
prove," he said, admonishing Stan
ford's sophomore team to do like
wise. Warner congratulated this

Conference pinnacle.
President Speaks
Trautman introduced the president
to present the football awards. "I
liked this team," said Dr. Wilbur. "I
liked it for its mistakes as well as its
victories," he remarked as he pre
sented the footballs. "I hope these
footballs are really gold. And I hope
that at some future time these men
do not have to put them in the
United Stales treasury." The audi
ence laughed and applauded the
humor of the president's speech.
The audience had more opportuni
ties to laugh and took them. It
laughed when "Tiny" Thornhill, fi
nally coaxed to say a few word.;,
bashfully stated President Wilbur
was "pinch-hitting" for him, and
that lie was merely lending his mo
ral support, letting "the big shots"
do all the talking.
When President Trautman spoke
of "Coach Howard Jones, whom we
all respect," the audience laughed
still more, but liberally applauded
Jones when he rose to present the
cup to Corbus.
