# Rugby a Prodigal?
## 
### 
A long, long lime ago, almost lon years to he exact,
Dink Templelon and a bunch of other Stanford men who
had hcen graduated only a few summers earlier, went on
a boat trip acioss the Atlantic and won the world's rugby
championship for the tinted States in the Kighlh Olvm
piade at Paris.
After their return to the United States, they were duly
feted and then rugby fell into decline. Some of the players
hated to see il go, although thev had derived as much sat
isfaction out of watching the American game, which grad
ually worked in some of the rugby features, such as lateral
passes.
Finally, a little over a year ago, some of the older
Stanfordites began to see where there was an opening for
their former favorite game as a winter sport. It was fitting
lhal they should lead the way in what appears to be a suc
cessful revival of rugby.
Likewise, it is fitting that today should bring (lie re
sumption of a series which used to be a high spot 011 the
Farm's athletic calendar, the international games with
Canada.
Actually, the resumption was started in December,
when a combined Cardinal-California team traveled north
to meet several British Columbia fifteens. But that had
the Hear smell attached to it. It wasn't a purely Stanford
affair, even if the Indians pronounced themselves thor
oughly contented and happy with their associates from
across the bay.
The real return of the series comes this afternoon. It
brings together a veteran team, men who had been playing
(he game at the time of the Eighth Olvmpiado, and a young
011 Hit which boasts of speed, strength, and willingness.
Rugby goes before the sporting jury this afternoon. We
hope that the verdict is favorable.
