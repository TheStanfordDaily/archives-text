A so-called modern morality play
is not as good a vehicle for the
Hampden Company's nineteenth
century acting as the melodramatic
Richelieu. In the eyes of a modern
audience, leligious fervor and the
slow redemption of three characters
cannot hold the same interest as the
artificial plot excitement and variety
of action of a melodrama. The play
ticked off like a smooth little ma
chine, with the splendid voices of
the entire cast balancing and blend
ing each other in pleasant organ ef
fects and with action co-ordinated
regularly with the script. Each figure
went through words and gestures
with clock-like precision. But there
was no thrilling plot to furnish sus
pense; there was only the slow rev
erence of all the actors toward their
roles and a consistent artificiality
of inflection and gesture which is not
best suited to such purely religious
matter.
The play is a storehouse of reli
gious symbolism and Christian mo
rality, written in the florid style ol
the late nineteenth century. The
cast made no attempt at realism;
they walked through and recited the
play. Edwin Cushman, as Bishop of
Lancashire, succeeded in establish
ing a realistic characterization, ac
cording to modern standards.
Walter Hampden is a very hand
some man and he has a very fine
voice. The role of Manson calls for
great calmness, restraint, and some
sardonic humor. Although there was
little opportunity for anything more
than a Buddhistic attitude of con
templation, Hampden played the role
to the hilt. He made the most of
every opportunity, and when there
was no opportunity, he at least was
always nice to look at and listen 10.
