The Editor, Sir:
With so large a proportion of our
college graduates finding their way
sooner or later into some phase of
business 'ife, the subject which Dr.
Wilbur will discuss Thursday eve
ning, namely, "College versus Pro
fessional Graduates in the Business
World," should be of the very great
est interest to a large number of the
senior class.
The subject really is a considera
tion of the value of professional
training to the young person desir
ous of entering business. Can one be
trained for business? Or, is business
something that can be learned only
by working for it? Is business dif
ferent in this regard from medicine,
or engineering?
We can train people for business
—not in the routine techniques of
the individual business concern—but
in the fundamentals of business and
business - i'dministration. Men so
trained are rapidly outstripping the
untrained college man, and are in
position to benefit themselves and
society at large in innumerable ca
pacities. My experience and obser
vation convinces me that professional
training for business parallels rather
closely, comparable training for any
other of life's callings.
