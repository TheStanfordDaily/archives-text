The Editor, Sir:
This is in answer to the wholly
adolescent, not to say childish, and
scurrilous attack upon me and my
committee for our efforts in putting
over the Military Ball by my dear
friend, Mr. Walker, in yesterday's
Campus Opinion.
In the first place, I might state as
a matter of common observation
that such hair-brained and wholly j
unfounded statements are precisely
the sort of thing that may be ex- j
pected from pacifists, even self-styled S
pacifists. We have oniy to note the j
words and writings of that weak- j
minded and cowardly breed to real
ize instantly the truth of my prsced- I
ing statement.
But we must be a bit lenient. To j
judge by the frequency with which
such persons let off steam in this i
column, they must derive an untold ;
quantity 01 satisfaction from airing j
their views, and it would be an un- 1
necessary cruelty to deprive them of i
that vicarious pleasure.
In so far as the rasn statements of '
my old friend, George, may be taken |
at all seriously, I might say that the
employment of the tank to advertise j
the Military Ball has achieved the j
status of a tradition; and therefore
cannot properly be held to be en
tirely devoid of dignity.
Further we resent the inference !
that the tank is old and wheezy, j
True enough, it valiently served in
the Great War, but it is kept in the
best of condition and is equipped j
with an excellent motor. We sus- |
pect that the wheeziness referred to
by Mr. Walker was wholly a figment
of his imagination, concocted by one •
who was not an eye-witness to its i

journey on Monday, for certainly it
did not wheeze.
Enough said, George! Enjoy your
self at our Military Ball.
Yours for an enjoyable evening i
