## WHAT'S SAUCE FOR THE GOOSE ....

; Stanford's women athletes have a
! gymnasium of far greater elegance
i and aesthetic beauty than that which
j houses the activities of the Farm's
| 3,000 strong-arm men Also, when
i men leave dimes and address books
in their lockers, they are only fairly
sure of finding them there when
they return from their workout. The
compacts and $5 bills of the '"800" are
seldom stolen, however. Why?
The lockers in the Women's Gym
| are kept inviolate by combination
j locks for which only one person is
I given the correct number. By chang
! ing the locks from one locker to an
other, there Ls no chance of an old
owner coming back two or three
years later, and finding her old com
■ bination. The custodians of Encina
Gym, however, have preserved the
( old-fashioned system of key locks—
j and worse yet: If an owner does not
! reapply for locker privileges, a dupli
cate of his key is issued to another
' student ■'he following year. Thus
j more than one person often owns a
■ key to the same locker.
j This is not an hypothetical case.
A few days ago I found at the bot
tom of a drawer—key 949 —which
i had been issued to me in the autumn
1 quarter of 1931. No l aware of the
custom of issuing duplicate keys,
j and hence believing that I was the
j only person who had a key to locker
| 949, I went to the Gym for the pur
| pose of taking a workout. The key
! fitted perfectly; locker 949 swung
I open, and there before my eyes were
J an excellent pair of boxing shoes, a
| very old tennis ball, and sundry
| other articles.
I was informed by the custodian
' that my case was not at all individ
ual, that every year several hundred
| students failed to return keys, and
that since all lockers were emptied
. on August 31, duplicate keys were
' made and issued in October. It is
I quite possible, therefore, that not
] only two, but many more, have keys
1 to the same locker.
!
It would be expensive but de
! cidedly worth while fo* - Encina Gym
to institute the thief-proof Women's
Gym combination lock system. Think
of the pitiable plight of the present
owner of locker 949! I'm sure that he
j is blissfully unaware that any time

! it is within my power to open locker
949, and avail myself of his very fine
boxing shoes, either for use (whicn
is highly unlikely) or for pawning
purposes. I shall, allow him to keep
! the tennis ball.—Albert J. Guerard
