## SUNNY JIM AND HIS CAMPAIGN 
### CROMPTON BANCS Jr 
California's hand-shaking Gover
nor Rolph comes up (or re-election
1 this year. Just now his chances look
poor. But who are the candidates
and what are the issues of the cam
paign?
The Parties
l In the past, most state elections
: have been essentially non-partisan;
1 personalities and policies of the in
dividual candidates were more im
portant than party affiliations. It i:;
1 true that nearly all the successful
j candidates were supposedly Republi-
I cans, but they had the best oiled ma-
I chinery for getting elected.
Things change. This year the De
. mocrats .stand a fair chance of win
ning. Nobody doubt:-, for a minute
: that this is because California went
I for Roosevelt in 1932. So for the
' first time in many years, the Demo
j crats will have almost as many reg
istered voters as the Republicans,
j This is point No. 1 in their favor. The
i rest hinges on the candidates and
the issues.
The Candidates
The Democrats hav< already hurt
J their chances by haggling over can
! didates, when they .should he busy
: building their choice into a state
| wide personality. Anyway, there are
two outstanding possibilities at prc
i sent. One is Milton K. Young, Los
Angeles (in his favor—the South
wants a Governor). He was badly
I trimmed for Governor four years
I ago. Another is J.F.T. O'Connor,
l U.S. Comptroller of the Currency,
also of L.A. He is a first-rate pol
itician, has had his eye on the job
| for some time, and has spoken fre
| quently in the South and in the right
places. x
There are some others, but none as
outstanding as these two. For some
time, faithful Democrats have been
! hoping that Postmaster-General
Farley, the No. 1 party politician,
; would point to the Moses to lead

them out of the wilderness, thus
settling the issue. But yesterday, he
refused to help.
There are three leading Republi
can candidates. State Treasurer
Johnson and Lieut. Governor Mer
riam (from the South) are busy on
state-wide good-will tours. But the
biggest fish in the political pond is
.still San Francisco's own Jimmy
Rolph, now touring the state's 58
counties mending political fences.
Just which one of these, if any, the
almost extinct Hiram Johnson ma
chine will support is uncertain.
The Issues
The main issue will be what
happened to the 39 million dollar
.surplus Rolph inherited from the
Young administration. Nearly every
one knows the answer: most of it
went up the chimney in wasteful
mismanagement and extravagance.
Political friends climbed on the
gravy train by the hundreds. The
state is now way in toe red.
Realizing thai ii will be impossible
for him to explain away the main
issue, Jimmy i,s looking for others
more favorable to hitn. The latest is
that the Lainson case can be turned
to his advantage by a pardon or a
sizeable commutation of sentence.
Mast lawyers consider the Lanuson
1 conviction quite shaky, and the in
tervention of the Governor's mercy
would turn the attention of the vot
ers to a human issue—where he ex
cels.
Such action might put Jimmy in a
tight spot on the Mooney case, for
many consider his claim equally as
' valid as Lamson's. In this case, ob
i servers say Rolph might even par
don Mooney at the same time. If this
happened, so much political dust
would be kicked up that nobody
would remember the 39 million or
wonder who got the gravy. And
most anything can happen in a Rolph
campaign.

There are some others, but none as

There are three leading Republi
can candidates. State Treasurer
Johnson and Lieut. Governor Mer

state-wide good-will tours. But the

The Issues
The main issue will be what
happened to the 39 million dollar

Young administration. Nearly every
one knows the answer: most of it
went up the chimney in wasteful
mismanagement and extravagance.
Political friends climbed on the
gravy train by the hundreds. The

for him to explain away the main
issue, Jimmy i,s looking for others
more favorable to hitn. The latest is
that the Lainson case can be turned
to his advantage by a pardon or a
sizeable commutation of sentence.
Mast lawyers consider the Lanuson
1 conviction quite shaky, and the in
tervention of the Governor's mercy
would turn the attention of the vot
ers to a human issue—where he ex
cels.
Such action might put Jimmy in a
tight spot on the Mooney case, for
many consider his claim equally as
' valid as Lamson's. In this case, ob
i servers say Rolph might even par
don Mooney at the same time. If this
happened, so much political dust
would be kicked up that nobody
would remember the 39 million or
wonder who got the gravy. And
most anything can happen in a Rolph
campaign.
