# SKULL AND SNAKES CUTS MEET TARIFF
## 
### 
Skull and Snakes, men's honorary,
which is backing the all-University
track meet March 10, in order to
raise funds to send the cinder path
men to Philadelphia lor the I.C.4A.'s,
made a wise move when it cut the
student admission price from 50 to 25
cents.
If the meet is to be made a suc
cess, it can only be done with the
whole-hearted support of the stu
dents, and high prices aren't going to
get that support. Apparently, the
team will only be sent East if suffi
cient funds are raised to finance the
trip, so student body support is es
sential.
Dink Templeton says that Stan
ford, with nine men, should be able
to score 3(5 points in the I.C.4A's.
Le,«s have frequently won the title
and it's 'ibout time it came back to
Stanford.
EASTERN TRIP
DEPENDS ON STUDENTS
Skull and Snakes has led the way,
by sponsoring the varsity-alumni
meet, but the funds secured from
lhat one effort probably won't be
sufficient to pay the expenses of the
squad and other ways of raising the
additional amount necessary must be
made use of.
Skull and Snakes took the initia
tive in starting the movement and
perhaps they will continue 'with it.
Whether they do or not, there is
plenty of room for other organiza
tions and group;; to get into the drive.
Whatever attempts are made to swell
the fund, none of them will be suc
cessful without student body co-op
eration, so the problem finally drops;
back into ihe lap of each individual
Stanfordite. If Stanford students
want a team in the Intercollegiates,
it's up to them to send it.
