## 
### 
Destined for the Stanford Geology
Department, a 20-foot relief map of
California in the form of a gift from
the California State Chamber of
Commerce arrived unexpectedly on
the campus Monday.
After a 30-mile ride from its for
mer resting place in the Feiry Build
ing, the heavy plaster-of-paris model
was eased painfully through double
doors by 25 groaning troughs to i*s
new location in the Geology Mu
seum.
Pronounced "typographically reli
able" by Professor Eliot Blackwel
der, head of the Geology Depart
ment, the model is chronologically
a trifle askew with respect to com
mercial geography. Although the lo
cation of Mayfield is clearly defined,
no indication of the existence of
Palo Alto can be found on the model
since it was constructed before Paly's
