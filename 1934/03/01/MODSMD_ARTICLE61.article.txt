# OUR AXE-MEN

The Editor, Sir:
Some time ago a statement was
made in *he Daily informing us that
the A.S.S.U. had decided to place one
of Stanford's most beloved sources ;
of tradition—the far-famed Axe —in
the Union Cellar where it may be
seen by ail. This, I believe, is a
splendid and commendable idea, for ]
sight of it should bring to the mind
of the Stanford Rough and his gent
ler counterpart, alike, thrilling mem
ories. But as a matter of fact, it has
been some little time since the pre
cious emblem was recaptured. Those
who participated in the daring expe
dition which returned it to us are ;
no longer here. Even most of those '
who were here at the time of its re
turn have gone front the campus. No
longer is it possible to have the story
of that great day related to us first- I
hand. Probably not one student in 50
even knows who the heroes of the
deed were.
It has meant much to Stanford, I ,
am sure, to get the axe back. The j

men who brought it back have ren
dered, indeed, a great service to the
school. Let us not forget them.
Should not the committee in charge
of placing the axe, therefore, do
something to recall ihose names to
us? Perhaps a plaque with their
names inscribed on it near the axe
would help. —Bob Livingston
