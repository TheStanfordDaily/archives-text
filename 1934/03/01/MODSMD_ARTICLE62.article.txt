The Editor, Sir:
There used io be o man on the
Barbary Coast who would let anyone
who paid a dollar hit him over the
head with a club. Professional sol
diers make a living in much the same
way; businessmen pay them to take
the blows evoked by business com
petition. Modern nations need sol
diers, sin .-e the first necessity when
you want 10 pull a dirty trick is to
have a string army or. your side. The
objection is that our paid fighters not
only want five-sixths of our national
income, but demand respect besides.
Even a fighting-cock requires only
shelter and food; it does not expect
to be treated as a human being, nor
does it have to be goaded into action
by being told that it lives in the nest
coop in the world.
The frothing at the mouth over my
pacifism is out of place since I am not
a pacifist. On the,contrary, I will be
glad to pay my share toward paying
our professional gladiators to fight
armies of America's "business com
petitors. My whole point is that these
professionals are not respectable. The
fact that wars may be inevitable has

nothing to do with this. Garbage is
' inevitably foul-smelling, but that is
, no excuse for making a life work of
! wallowing in it. Wars would not be
inevitable if everyone refused to
fight in them. People who spend
four years or more studying how to
1 be soldiers naturally want war. A
1 person who goes to cooking school
: for four years would certainly be
disappointed if he never had a chance
to cook after graduating. An actor
; who rehearses a play for four years
' is anxious for the performance to
1 begin.
As an R.O.T.C. defender wrote
i yesterday, a man has a right to be
cannon fodder if he chooses. I am
glad that so many young Americans
i are willing to oe targets. It will help
business. But don't expect the rest of
us to consider your profession a
| decent one, or expect us to obey of
ficers we wouldn't invite to our own
I homes. And soldiers shouldn't cx-
I pect much pay. They can always
I pick up a few dollars in their spare
i time at the Barbary Coast.
