# 'Stanford Daze" Will Play Here
## 
### 
The barbaric dress imd manners of j
Stanford's latter 'middle-ages—that
frowsy, glamorous period which 1
came to a close about 10 years ago— '
will be revealed to the present Farm :
generation on March 7, when the j
film "Stanford Daze" is presented.
In the years since 1°24, when this i
feature was made, few aspects of)
Stanford life have not undergone j
change. The "Toonei ville Trolley" j
is now gone; in its place are the j
heavy, luxurious bus'-is so little pa
tronized by students., Encina Gym, |
the fruit of Stanford's athletic glory •
during the third decade of the cen
tury, was not yet completed at that i
time, and many other familiar cam- !
pus landmarks of today were then
only figments in the mind of the Ad
ministration.
"Stanford Daze" is not a college
pictorial travelogue; it is a "gla
morous romance of college life." lis
leading man is Lloyd Nolan, a promi
nent campus actor in 1924, whrt has
since risen to the heights of Broad
way success. O. O. Mclntyre cred
; ited Nolan with the finest individual
| performance of the 1932 theatre sea
| son.
I "Stanford Daze" Ls the second film
j of the double-feature program which
I will be presented by the English
. Club. V. L. Pudovkin's famous
| "Storm over Asia" is the principal
j part of the program.
In compliance with the Daily's
editorial drive for 25-cent, moving
pictures, this low admission charge
will be in effect for students who
I wish io attend.
