### 15, v Chuck Clancy 
A scrappy crew of Stanford mitt

by upsetting the California boxing
team (3 bouts to 5 before a goodly
crowd in Encina pavilion.
The victory reversed an earlier
Stanford defeat at the hand of the
Bears when they scored a 7 to 4 win

way and the outcome was not cer

ning when John Fowler counted a
technical knockout over Marcus
Swinney alter 30 seconds of fighting.
Swinney was floored with a hard
light to the jaw.
In the last bout of the evening,
after Stanford had cinched the
match, Wes Muller lost a close deci
sion to Jim Castle, hard hitting Bear
heavyweight.
California set an early lead win
ning three of the first four matches,
but Waldo Munday and Newt Rid
ley, both of Stanford, put the Indians
in the money by winning their bouts
in the 149-pound class.
Newt Ridley's technical K.O. vic
tory over Dick Smith was somewhat
of a surprise to spectators. The two
hauled and shoved each other for
two rounds. In the third Ridley shot
out a nice left to lloor his opponent.

A scrappy crew of Stanford mitt
men climaxed the season last night
by upsetting the California boxing
team (3 bouts to 5 before a goodly
crowd in Encina pavilion.
The victory reversed an earlier
Stanford defeat at the hand of the
Bears when they scored a 7 to 4 win
over the Cards a few weeks ago.
The going was nip and tuck all the
way and the outcome was not cer
tain until the tenth bout of the eve
ning when John Fowler counted a
technical knockout over Marcus
Swinney alter 30 seconds of fighting.
Swinney was floored with a hard
light to the jaw.
In the last bout of the evening,
after Stanford had cinched the
match, Wes Muller lost a close deci
sion to Jim Castle, hard hitting Bear
heavyweight.
California set an early lead win
ning three of the first four matches,
but Waldo Munday and Newt Rid
ley, both of Stanford, put the Indians
in the money by winning their bouts
in the 149-pound class.
Newt Ridley's technical K.O. vic
tory over Dick Smith was somewhat
of a surprise to spectators. The two
hauled and shoved each other for
two rounds. In the third Ridley shot
out a nice left to lloor his opponent.
