# Wide Brims, Low Crowns Seen in College Hats
## 
### 
Men's hats have taken another
j; ther erratic turn in ihe over-shift
ing cycles of fashion with the pres
l! 11 style showing a tendency toward
wider brims and lower crowns for
university men.
As to color, the rati er odd combi
nation of a black band on a brown
hat is rapidly coming into fashion.
The method of wearing the head
gear has also undergone a pro
nounced change, "Esquire," popular
men's magazine, asseits. Snap brim
hats do not now have pinched crowns
while hats with turned up brims are
now worn pinched. This is exactly
opposite to former fashionable
trends.
