# SWIMMING SUITS AND SHORTS ARE BRIEF THIS YEAR
## Gay Colored Beach Togs Will Be Seen 
### 
It is going to be a shorts season — ;
not in terms of time, but in terms of
what one will wear on the beaches.
Spring vacation at Carmcl will not j
be completely right without a gayly
colored play suit that is fashion's j
jauntiest and most becoming style. I
Beach pajamas are definitely out |
and more shorts are being shown ;
than ever before. There are several
styles—one piece that button on the
shoulder and at the w.iist with bright;
wooden disks; two piece outfits that
have blouses and three piece outfits
with a detachable skirt. In one of
these, the sports loving girl is sedate
enough for Sunday chapel, but ready
for the tennis game afterwards.
Linen, gingham, pique, and other j
popular cottons are ideal for the
shorts suits. In color they range j
from pure white that looks better
than anything else for tennis to
fashion's most brilliant shade.
Checks, plaids, and patterned goods
are grand for shorts that are going
to be worn at the beach.
Accessories should be sporting.
Knitted caps or the becoming new
linen head bands are best to keep
the hair smooth. Sox, of course, or
no stockings at all are worn with low
heeled sport oxfords or sandals.
Bathing suits are still being worn
this season —to the relief of some
who were wondering if they were
going to get smaller and shorter, and
disappear entirely.
The new swim suitj do not show
any radical change. Novelty knits
I and patterns are more popular than
last year. Two-piece suits with ban
dana tops are being featured as are
, the hard-to-wear lines of the one
piece B.V.D. oytfits.
There is an attempt on the part of
| some designers to make bathing
! more feminine with dainty skirts of
gingham, linen, and even taffeta.
While this may be popular among
older women or bathing beauties
! who "don't go near the water" the
active college girl will try to get as
much briefness and freedom for her
J swimming activities as possible.
