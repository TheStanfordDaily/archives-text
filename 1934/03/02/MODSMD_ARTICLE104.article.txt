# Beauty Expert Explains Artistic Use of Make-up
## 
### 
"The art of make-up is the art of j
playing up one's face â€” not one's
clothes!" says Helena Rubenstein, I
noted beauty specialist. Powder
gives one the "veil of glamour,"
rouge the "highlight of loveliness," |
lipstick "glorifies one's personality," I
and mascara adds that "touch of
mystery."
By a careful and artistic make-up
one can change one's personality,
and improve the apparent contour 1
and proportions of the face, as well ;
as bring out the best features and
draw attention away from the poor
ones.
Rouge used cleverly can change
the apparent shape of the face, and ,
lend depth and brilliancy to the !
eyes. The girl with a long slender j
face can make it seem rounder by
rouging the outside of the cheeks; 1
the girl with the broad or round
face should wear her rouge close to
the nose, and in a lengthened line;
the oval face should have the cheeks
rouged as the natural color ap- ;
pears, with the point of highest em- ,
phasis on the cheek-bones.
Subtle use of eyeshadow can do
as much for the face as rouge used
correctly, for eyes can be made to
seem deeper, larger, and more ex
pressive. However, a careful study
should be made of the shape and
spacing of the eyes, for eyeshadow
placed wrongly can make one ap
pear ridiculous as well as unat
tractive.
Of course, the color of the eye
should be carefully considered be
fore the eyeshadow is selected. Blue
eyes should have blue shadow, ha
zel eyes green or blue-green, brown
eyes should have green or brown,
and very dark brunettes should
wear blue or green.

Lipstick is considered by many
experts the most important step in
make-up, and it should always be
applied last. One should be ex
ceedingly careful to select the shade
which blends with costume and .
finger-nail polish, as well as with 1
the rest of the facial make-up.
Lipstick can be cleverly applied
to improve the shape of the lips. |
Persons with thick lips should avoid
carrying the color to the outer
edges of the mouth; thin lips should
have a bright shade of lipstick ap
plied generously all over the sur
face; the wide mouth should have
the color concentrated in the cen
ter of the lips, and lightly blended
toward the corners. If the under
lip alone is thick the lipstick should
be applied more heavily on the up
per one. If one is so fortunate as !
to have a naturally well-shaped!
mouth, its beauty can be brought
out by carefully following the nat
ural outline.
