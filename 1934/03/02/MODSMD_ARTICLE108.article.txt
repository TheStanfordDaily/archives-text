I everyone from sweet sixteen to fair,
i fat, and forty, breaks into print.
There are prints for all—if you are
the daring type, a bold dashing de
sign would be becoming; if you are ,
| conservative, small floral patterns
! are available.
Prints owe their inspiration to
i rious sources. Clever designers have
I introduced the Persian type thai
have multicolored figures with solid
colored borders. English prints are
gay and fresh in floral designs, and
Kussia is expressed with modern
istic designs with a tendency to em- i
i phasize industry. j
From Mexico comes the red, yel- j
low, and black print that is the sea- i
| son's gayest combination. It is found j
, on shoes and coats as well as 011'
dresses. The Mexican influence was j
the most strongly evidenced ofie of :
the spring fashion showings in Paris |
?nd New York.
Prints, which start the season off I
in a galaxy of color, will probably j
! be good during the summer months, I
although their place ai the top may;
1 be taken by pastels and solid bright j
shades.
