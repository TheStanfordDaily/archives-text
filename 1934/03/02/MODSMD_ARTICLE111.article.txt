shoulder ruffles are an early spring
favorite, with dots and plaids also
popular.
Several models have Spiral floun
ces, cascades of shirring rippling
from waistline to hem, and show the
Madame Recamier influence in the
bell-like princess silhouette.

capes floating cloud-like around the
shoulders.

girl skirts with fan-like trains in
bright colored prints ui lilac, poppy,
and wisteria.
