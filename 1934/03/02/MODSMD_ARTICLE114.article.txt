## 
### 
A new evening sandal which has
just made its appearance in San
Francisco stores illustrates the way
in which fashions are born. One of
America's leading shoe manufactur
ers was eating soup from an abalone
shell in a San Francisco restaurant
not long ago, when he noticed the
shell and its apoline, satin lustre. He
copied the shell in satin, and the re
sultant creation will adorn many a
feminine foot this spring.

The aim of the designers this sea
son is to create a flowing effect.
