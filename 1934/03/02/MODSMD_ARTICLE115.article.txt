# BLUE PREDICTED AS SEASON'S SMARTEST SHADE FOR CAMPUS
## Rough Materials Shown In Smarter Shops 
### 
Co-eds will have to be blue to be |
in style this season, and if they are a
bit rough about it an even greater i
degree of smartness will be attained. J
In other words, it's a blue season as
far as fashion's mood is concerned
and rough weaves are more popular
than ever.
Navy blue scores first place with
commander, a few s hades lighter j
than navy, and fleet, a bright blue,
"sailing" close behind on "rough
seas." French blue requires a new
name, "beauvais," pronounced "bo- •
vay," this season. The shade is as j
light as Alice blue but with a pansy
hue that makes it especially charm
ing on blonde and Titian types.
The new aqua tones of blue greens
and green blues are as cool and re- ;
freshing as a dip in Lagunita in the !
spring. Even the K.auty-resisting
"rough" will make a "dive" for bru
i nettes when they "splash" out m
aqua and turquoise colors.
A new way to become "dazzling" '
is offered by stylists as they send
word to bright young things that gay I
prints with the blues trying hard to j
come through from the background j
. are the later tip.
' Stormy weather won't harm clothes
this spring. All the new materials i
have novel effects that will even
stand the splash from campus mud j
puddles without a serious disaster.
Monotone silks are still having a |
rough time of it with pebbled sur- j
faces and Mexican color trimmings. j
Cloth as crunchy as campus gravel j
walks will make th'_> smartest cos- j
tumes, but corded silks will not be ,
far behind in making chic spring
outfits.
