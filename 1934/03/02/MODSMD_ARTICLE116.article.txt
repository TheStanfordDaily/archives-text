# MEN WEAR SHADES
## 
### 
An entirely new masculine inno
vation is the "cummerbund" or sash,
to be worn in the warmer climates
with the white tuxedo. It appears
in blue, maroon, wine or deep pur
ple, shows pockets and has the value
of holding the stomach in.

Heim's fastenings are of metalâ€” i
for example, a ball and square holds |
together coat fronts that do not
meet.
