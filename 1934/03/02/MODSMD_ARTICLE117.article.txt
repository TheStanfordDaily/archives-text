# Finger Nails Turn to Gold
## 
### 
Finger-nails which have been in
the red for several j-easons, now go
on the gold standardâ€”if you have
sufficient savoir-faire.
It is with relief to many that the
fad of Chinese red and carmine col
oring for milady's hands is passing.
Green, black, and blue are also con
sidered not just right unless one is
going to a fancy dress ball.
Outside ol the goici naiis for the
very daring, colors for finger tip.s
will be lighter and on the* salmon
and orange shades. The newest
wrinkle that has been popular for
some time in the East is finger-nail
clips that fasten on.
With the new sandals very much
in style, toes are destined to receive
as much attention as fingers. A de
gree of restraint in decorating one's
toes with nail polish is recommended.
