"Stanford roughs are getting
smooth," asserts "Ollie" Amdahl,
star two-mile runner and Encina
representative of a Palo Alto cloth

The place of prominence so long
held by the dirty corduroy and
shapeless moleskin is being usurped
by gi'ey flannels, Harris tweed
slacks, and pants of garbardine, a
fast-coming material with a close
nap that wears like iron.
"The very newest in trousers have
a built-in belt that is adjusted by
two slip-buckles at the side, while
the zipper front is in to stay," he
states.
Bright, gaudy sweaters are gone,
being replaced by mohair and
brushed-wool sweaters of soft greys,
blues, and tans. Sweater sets, con
sisting of a coat sweater and a
sleeveless sweater to match, are
fast gaining in favor. And cold days

now bring out scores of the new
' Moulton, or shoreleave, jackets.
"Besides the already popular
sports-back coats, new ensembles of
' a sports-back coat with pants in a
I lighter shade of the same color as
j the coat are coming in. Incidentally,
it is now correct to wear dark slacks
with a light-colored coat—a com
plete reversal of former conven
tions," Amdahl said.
While last year's favorite tie pat
! terns, the plaid and pindot, are still
the favorites, the long-forgotten
knitted 'ties are coming back in
• again.
Spring shirts are of solid colors;
the only patterns being stripes. The
points of the collars are all rounded
or button-down, so the tab collar
still holds its place. The low-neck
band collar which has in the past
proven so popular on the campus
( i:- still worn extensively.
