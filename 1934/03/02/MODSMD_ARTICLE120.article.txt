# New Lingerie Goes Feminine
## 
### 
Unmentionables are going "bon
bon"â€”which means to the initiated
that the new lingerie is going to be
very frilly with ruffles, laces, and
other feminine frou-frou.
The trouble with the new night
gowns will be keeping their own
ers from wearing them to a formal
dance, so closely do their lines and
material follow the evening styles.
The windblown silhouette has its
place even in nighties which flare
at the back with more than a sug
gestion of a train. The very elabo
rate ones, which would be certain to
cause a sensation in a college dor
mitory, have tiny puffed sleeves,
lace epaulets, and modishly draped
fronts.
More practical perhaps for co-ed
needs are the smartly tailored pa
jama sets in broadcloth or heavy
silk with three-quai'ter length robe.
