# Fashion Emphasis Placed on Neckwear with New Collar Creations
## Stylish Miss Will Get it In the Neck 
### 
"Right in the Neck" is no longer
the name of a football yell, but the
direction of stylists' emphasis this
year. Scarfs and collars are made
of materials delicious to see and
feel, and they are arranged in a
mode most unique.
When we consider the ways in
which the new neckwear is worn,
we see that not only the way of all
flesh is strange, but also that of
textiles. It begins at the neck and
right up under the chin, and from
there it radiates out. Sometimes it
leaps forth into space, and some
times it spreads out into a very
broad collar —• even of sailor-like
proportions. Anything might hap
pen, but the desired destiny is
something imaginative, feminine and
intriguing—never plainly obviousor
standardized or dull. That is out, in
1934!
To describe what's what, where,
how and why, in neckwear is diffi
cult and bewildering, since there is
so much of the new and different,
and since the charm is so elusive to
the mortal vocabulary.
In brief, collars are made of these
materials: organdy, old lace, linen,
waffled pique, flat crepe or organza.
The list of favorite colors is topped
by white iind goes on with prints
and bold monotones, stripes and
checks. Methods of making: plain
with hand-rolled edges, ruffled, or
with fagotting, which is now termed
"entre deux," if you please.
Delicacy, intricacy, and femininity
arc features this spring. Simple
frocks with exciting trimmings are
the things chosen in great numbers
for wardrobes. Sometimes we have
flowers in a cluster — white or col
ored or anything you wish. Some
times we use glorified bows of lace
or silk.
Scarfs are certainly erring from
the beaten path of convention! They
are made of taffeta or starched chif
fon, or any other fabrics with body. 1
Limp materials, if used, ar-e care
fully lied to evade dripping ends,
either into short and perky bows or
in some manner shortened into
sauciness.
A tip straight from accessory buy
ers which sizzles with newness, is
lhat the very latest in tieing scarfs
is to make one single loop form the
top of a cascading jabot effect with
the two ends, one hanging lower
than the other, making the rest—
very foxy when done.

which the new neckwear is worn,
we see that not only the way of all
flesh is strange, but also that of
textiles. It begins at the neck and
right up under the chin, and from
there it radiates out. Sometimes it
leaps forth into space, and some
times it spreads out into a very
broad collar —• even of sailor-like
proportions. Anything might hap
pen, but the desired destiny is
something imaginative, feminine and
intriguing—never plainly obviousor
standardized or dull. That is out, in
1934!
To describe what's what, where,
how and why, in neckwear is diffi
cult and bewildering, since there is
so much of the new and different,
and since the charm is so elusive to
the mortal vocabulary.
In brief, collars are made of these
materials: organdy, old lace, linen,
waffled pique, flat crepe or organza.
The list of favorite colors is topped
by white iind goes on with prints
and bold monotones, stripes and
checks. Methods of making: plain
with hand-rolled edges, ruffled, or
with fagotting, which is now termed
"entre deux," if you please.
Delicacy, intricacy, and femininity
arc features this spring. Simple
frocks with exciting trimmings are
the things chosen in great numbers
for wardrobes. Sometimes we have
flowers in a cluster — white or col
ored or anything you wish. Some
times we use glorified bows of lace
or silk.
Scarfs are certainly erring from
the beaten path of convention! They
are made of taffeta or starched chif
fon, or any other fabrics with body. 1
Limp materials, if used, ar-e care
fully lied to evade dripping ends,
either into short and perky bows or
in some manner shortened into
sauciness.
A tip straight from accessory buy
ers which sizzles with newness, is
lhat the very latest in tieing scarfs
is to make one single loop form the
top of a cascading jabot effect with
the two ends, one hanging lower
than the other, making the rest—
very foxy when done.
"Right in the Neck" is no longer
the name of a football yell, but the
direction of stylists' emphasis this
year. Scarfs and collars are made
of materials delicious to see and
feel, and they are arranged in a
mode most unique.
