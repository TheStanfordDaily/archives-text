# Scents to Be Used Subtly
## Must Suit Type of Person, Mood, and Occasion 
### 
'"Let us be glamourous" is the
motto for spring. It's what we all
want, but to attain it, some of us
use methods which are more tradi
tional than effective. One of these
is perfume. Perfume is the most
glamourous thing in the world if
used correctly—the right kind, the
right amount, and the right place.
Perfume must be subtly applied,
not slathered on. Its delicate scent
should grow mysteriously on your
escort, not hit him in the face when
he first greets you. Here are some
rules for perfume that many could
profit by:
Don't put perfume on anything
that isn't cleaned frequently. Lin
gerie, handkerchiefs, washable col
lars and the skin are better than the
hair.
It's clever to put perfume around
the hems of your gown and slip so
that every movement wafts the
scent upward.
A dab of perfume on the lining
of an evening bag is not such a bad
idea, but don't try it on streej- bags
as they are soiled too easily.
An atomizer is the best way of
applying perfume.
If you're trying to be dainty, don't
use an oriental perfume. Jasmine,
lilac, gardenia, or some lighter
blend is much better.
Only if your appearance qualifies
you for the Greta Garbo type, can
you risk a musky, exotic perfume.
