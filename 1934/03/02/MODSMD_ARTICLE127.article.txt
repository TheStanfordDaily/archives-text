# HAIRDRESS FOLLOWS NEW UPWARD TREND
## Styles Say Coiffure To Be On Up and Up 
### 
Coiffures this season have an up
ward and backward sweep, with
curls cascading from the crown of
the head down to the hair line, but
not below, as they have formerly.
Although curls will be used at all
times, they will be more elaborate
and numerous for evening.
Hair styles will depend a great
deal, as usual, on the hats which
will be worn. The blown-back
from-the-face look harmonizes with
the backward trend in the new hats,
which hide the back of the hair
more than the old ones did.
Hair will be worn simply about
the face, and bangs are entirely dis
carded, even for evening.
All hairdressers are reporting that
women are having their hair cut
oftener and shorter than last year,
and that they almost never see long
hair.
