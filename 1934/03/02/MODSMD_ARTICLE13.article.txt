## Washington Board Retracts Co-operative Exemption 
### 
"The Stanford Co-op Bookstore
must pay $6,314 back taxes." This
was the statement of the Associated
Press which the surprised Bookstore
manager read in Thursday morn
ing's paper.
The article stated that the board
of tax appeals in Washington, D.C.,
had ruled that the University Book
store is not exempt as a co-operative
institution, and upheld the Bureau
of Internal Revenue in assessing tax
claims in varying amounts for each
year from 1919 to 1928. The board
had over-ruled a previous ruling of
the Bureau that the Bookstore was
exempt.
As the Bookstore h<.s received no
notice of the new ruling, the man
agement is waiting with keen inter
est to learn of the reasons for the
reversed decision.
President T. M. MacQuarrie of the
San Jose State College was of the
opinion that the San Jose co-op
would not be affected by the recent
ruling, "as it is on state property,
operated by the state, and the na
tional government cannot tax the
state. We are a public institution
and would not be affected."
