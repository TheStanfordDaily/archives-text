# Theatre Plans May Materialize Before End of School Year
## New Assembly Hall Seats To Be Independent Of Memorial Group 
### Hy Annalee Whitmorc 
Proposed plans for a Stanford -
1 Memorial Theatre group, long dis- i
! cussed, may materialize before con- j
elusion of the school year, declared !
Comptroller Almon E. Roth late yes
| terday.
Definite action on the much-de
manded structure is under way,!
with authorities outlining two pos- j
sible courses of procedure. Roth i
promises that in any event, replace- \
ment of seats in the assembly hall !
will in no way affect the construc
tion of a new edifice.
"The hall will be utilized for the
larger classes, regardless of whether
or not we obtain a new building, j
and hence is in need of repairs," he I
explained.
Plans To Be Drawn
At the request of the theatre fund j
committee, two plans are to be
drawn- up by official university ar
chitects within 30 days, Roth said.
The first, involving an expenditure j
of approximately $300,000, will in- j
elude the War Memorial Fund, sub- j
ject of recent controversy.
The fund, initiated in 1919, was !
originally .intended for the purpose j
of erecting a memorial to Stanford \
alumni, totaling over 3,000, who j
participated in the World War. A ■
"Memorial Hall, noble in propor- j
tions .... and an auditorium" were j
then stipulated.
$170,000 Available
Today the amount, swelled by ac- !
cumulated interest, far surpasses the I
$150,000 mark. Combined with the !
Theatre Fund resulting from last
year's agitation, a sum in the neigh- j
borhood of $170,000 would be avail- j
able for construction by next Au- j
gust.
Details of the first plan call for a |
memorial group, combining a tower !
and more practical theatre. They I
would form the basis of a tentative |
second quadrangle, to be situated!
between the present quad and the j
Encina-Toyon-Branner group.
Behind the edifice would be a me- !
morial court, with the art gallery to !
the right.
A.S.S.U. May Aid
Just from where the remaining!
$130,000 would be forthcoming is as j
yet indefinite. However, according to j
Stan Beaubaire, the Theatre Fund I
i
committee, instrumental in the plans j
to date, is hoping to sponsor an idea j
whereby the A.S.S.U. could com- |
plete the difference for immediate ;
action.
Architects are at present occupied
in designing the new women's dor
mitory, but could offer sketches and
estimates within a month.
Second Plan
The second plan as set forth by :
Roth, less drastic and ambitious in j
scope, would consist of completely ;
remodelling the present assembly
hall without use of the memorial I
funds. An entire new stage, new j
decorations, and more efficient shape ;
would result, with seating capacity !
probably less'than the present 1,746.
Suggestions that the memorial
fund be employed in the construc
tion of a theatre have met with va- i
rious objections, pointing out the j
fact that an entire memorial unit j
must be constructed if anything at j
all is to be done.
Claims that the sum was con- ;
ccived for an edifice of a com- j
plctcly memorial nature would be !
overcome, Roth points out. by inclu- :
sion of the tower and court as in |
the first plan.
Both President Ray Lyman Wil- I
bur and Roth regard the idea fa- j
vorably. "As interested as any stu- j
dent." declares Wilbur regarding his j
attitude, while whole-hearted sup- !
port is pledged by Roth, who has
taken the initiative in proposals to i
date.

At the request of the theatre fund j
committee, two plans are to be
drawn- up by official university ar
chitects within 30 days, Roth said.
The first, involving an expenditure j
of approximately $300,000, will in- j
elude the War Memorial Fund, sub- j
ject of recent controversy.
The fund, initiated in 1919, was !
originally .intended for the purpose j
of erecting a memorial to Stanford \
alumni, totaling over 3,000, who j
participated in the World War. A ■
"Memorial Hall, noble in propor- j
tions .... and an auditorium" were j
then stipulated.
$170,000 Available
Today the amount, swelled by ac- !
cumulated interest, far surpasses the I
$150,000 mark. Combined with the !
Theatre Fund resulting from last
year's agitation, a sum in the neigh- j
borhood of $170,000 would be avail- j
able for construction by next Au- j
gust.
Details of the first plan call for a |
memorial group, combining a tower !
and more practical theatre. They I
would form the basis of a tentative |
second quadrangle, to be situated!
between the present quad and the j
Encina-Toyon-Branner group.
Behind the edifice would be a me- !
morial court, with the art gallery to !
the right.
A.S.S.U. May Aid
Just from where the remaining!
$130,000 would be forthcoming is as j
yet indefinite. However, according to j
Stan Beaubaire, the Theatre Fund I
i
committee, instrumental in the plans j
to date, is hoping to sponsor an idea j
whereby the A.S.S.U. could com- |
plete the difference for immediate ;
action.
Architects are at present occupied
in designing the new women's dor
mitory, but could offer sketches and
estimates within a month.
Second Plan
The second plan as set forth by :
Roth, less drastic and ambitious in j
scope, would consist of completely ;
remodelling the present assembly
hall without use of the memorial I
funds. An entire new stage, new j
decorations, and more efficient shape ;
would result, with seating capacity !
probably less'than the present 1,746.
Suggestions that the memorial
fund be employed in the construc
tion of a theatre have met with va- i
rious objections, pointing out the j
fact that an entire memorial unit j
must be constructed if anything at j
all is to be done.
Claims that the sum was con- ;
ccived for an edifice of a com- j
plctcly memorial nature would be !
overcome, Roth points out. by inclu- :
sion of the tower and court as in |
the first plan.
Both President Ray Lyman Wil- I
bur and Roth regard the idea fa- j
vorably. "As interested as any stu- j
dent." declares Wilbur regarding his j
attitude, while whole-hearted sup- !
port is pledged by Roth, who has
taken the initiative in proposals to i
date.

Definite action on the much-de
manded structure is under way,!
with authorities outlining two pos- j
sible courses of procedure. Roth i
promises that in any event, replace- \
ment of seats in the assembly hall !
will in no way affect the construc
tion of a new edifice.
"The hall will be utilized for the
larger classes, regardless of whether
or not we obtain a new building, j
and hence is in need of repairs," he I
explained.
