# CANADIAN REPS DEFEAT INDIANS CLOSE GAME
## B.C. All-Stars Score 3-0 Victory in Closing Five Minutes of Play VISITORS SHOW CLASS Contest Marks Revival Of International Rugby 
### Spud Hamilton 
After a lapse of 18 years, interna
tional rugger, and good rugger, too,
returned to Northern California yes
terday when the All-Star British
Columbia "Rep" team edged out
Stanford '.'.-0 in a scrappy, fighting
game that was a toss-up to the very
last instant when Johnny Reisner
darted out of bounds on the Cana
dian 5-yard line after a long pass
ing rush.
The winning points came with
about five minutes of play remain
ing and when the game seemed
destined for stalemate, when All-
Canadian Bob Norminton booted a
penalty kick over the Stanford goal
from the 30-yard line. Referee
Reading had awarded the kick when
a Stanford man was obviously off
side on the previous play.
Indians Threaten
Innumerable times the Stanford
fifteen came within inches of scor
ing, one occasion coming immedi
ately after the British Columbia
score when Jim Mullin fell on the
ball over the goal line after his
teammate Abbot had blocked one of
the Canadian's kicks. The referee
was right on top of the play and
ruled no goal because Mullin was
offside and a knock-on by Abbott
had been committed.
The game simmered down after a
few awkward opening moments to a
battle between the Stanford back
field and the aggressive Canadian
scrum who wheeled, dribbled and
heeled the ball out to a nicety.
When the visiting backfield opened
up with their passing rushes, vicious
Stanford tackling played hob with
their offense, and they made little
ground at the running game.
Reisner Stars
Johnny Reisner put on a show in
the first half, once rounding out as
if he were on a reverse, halfway
across the field to cut in and streak
for the goal, releasing a nice pass to
halfback George Fuller when he was
caught.
Roger Hager played the game of
his life in the scrum for Stanford,
leading the Card dribbling and, with
Ben Palamountain, continually hav
rassing the pint-sized Canadian
halfback Yoshi Ono.
