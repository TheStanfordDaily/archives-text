Although! Tun Daily is strong for Hie retention, in fad,
of the Stanford Rough, colorful and staunch creature that
lie,is, today it slips a bit and gives the campus the low
down on how well-dressed men look.
Advertisers, through whose co-operation it is possible
to give you this paper each day, have put themselves out
in more ways than one (as have Tin: Daily's business and
editorial departments) to give you the latest information
on fashions.
Well-dressed women, too, ill enjoy the most recent
announcements on "chic 111 is" and "ducky thai" which ap
peal" in the advertisements and Fashion Section columns.
We hope you'll like it.
