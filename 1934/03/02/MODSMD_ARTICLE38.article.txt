# STANFORD "KULTURE"

"If you snakes cannot enjoy the show, crawl oft* in
the grass and let some one else enjoy it!" a young
woman said recently in the course of a tongue lashing
which she gave a mob of young Stanford hoodlums
and Palo Alio High School bullies who were making
the guests of one of the beautiful theatres on Univer
sity avenue miserable.
The voung woman's rebuke had no effect on the
students whose hisses continued to till the theatre in
spite of all the management could do. It is a common
occurrence for these uneducated and uncultured jack
asses to annoy the guests and management of the Palo
Alio theatres each night. Recently a group of business
men were discussing the situation.
"It is not the bad checks that these college hood
lums pass on us, that bothers us so much," one man
said.
"And it's not the arrogance of the ignoramuses,"
another said.
"And it's not the fact that they habitually get by
with murder, and get off with slight rebukes, or out of
the city bastile, with no correction or publicity at all
for fear that their CAREERS wrll be ruined," a third
added.
"It is simply this," a fourth man said speaking for
all present. "It is simply that the roughnecks have
taken possession of our shows and they refuse to let
us or our families enjoy our evenings together."
At another business men's caucus, held in a local
barber shop where the same subject came up, it was
William C.lemo, Palo Alto's lighting fire chief who ex
plained how in the old days when men were men, the
citizens of the town often joyfully fought for their
rights. One man had just finished telling of a gang
that came near wrecking a theatre. C.lemo told of a
time when the fire department had been called in, and
during the course of the evening he was compelled to
draw one of the youths the full length of the aisle and
out of the theatre by his necktie.
Palo Alto citizens who have formed a habit of kick
ing at high taxes and the standing army the police
department, should attend one of our local theatres
and witness the display of Stanford "Kulturc," as well
as some of our high school "Kulturc." The police de
partment is either too small, or afraid of ruining some
CARKKRS.
There ought to be a lot more CAREERS ruined.
That is why the country got into its present condition
not enough CAREERS ruined in our colleges. We
harbor and pamper and finally educate thousands of
half baked egotists, and then turn them loose to prey
on the country as bond salesmen. If the professors are
100 tender-hearted to spoil the career of a worthless
bit of humanity trading on the name of his Alma Ma
ter, then the police force should do so. The good of
the nation demands it! â€” Palo Alto News
