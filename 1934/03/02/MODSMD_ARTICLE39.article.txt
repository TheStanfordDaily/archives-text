"Hello Hill, may I give you a lift?" This cheery,
well-meaning greeting spells the difference between
profit or loss for the Palo Alto bus line. Bill is stand
ing on a corner waiting for a bus. 11 is neighbor,
George, comes along in his car and his natural impulse
is to give Hill a lift. George does not think of what he
is doing to the bus company.
There is likely no way to stop the Georgc-and-Bill
combination from bringing woe to the bus people, but
if we look just a little farther, what do we see? The
bus line is showing a definite loss every month and un
less something is done about if, it is only a question of
time until there will be no bus line. That will leave
Hill in a very bad way. And there are many like him
in Palo Alto who are dependent upon the buses, ex
cept on those occasions when the hail comes: "Hello
Hill, may I give you a lift?" It is a strange paradox,
but George's kindness to Hill, carried to the point
where it puts the bus line out of business, is really
working Hill a hardship and an injury. Funny old
world, isn't it Let's give the bus line a break!

From The Sim's discussion of the problem, we must
assume that every time a driver sees a friend standing on
a corner wailing for a lift, he must turn up his nose and
let the friend wait. Nice going. Sun.
