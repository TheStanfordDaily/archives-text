At the Columbia Theatre
A number of striking moments
| and skillful handling of many over
familiar lines were the distinguish
ing features of Walter Hampden's
production of "Hamlet," on the
whole a well-rounded version of
that great tragedy.
One can almost appreciate the dif
ficulties of the old lady who ob
jected to "Hamlet" because it was
"too full of quotations," and one can
certainly sympathize with actors who
are faced with rendering some of
the most quoted line;; of literature.
And in the main the current per
formers, notably of course Hamp
den himself, capably acquit them
selves of this burden.
Among the most striking moments
was that in which Hamlet first con
verses with the ghost of his father,
a scene made extremely effective by
simple staging and by sincere play
ing on the part of the star. The
familiar soliloquies were admirably
handled, and the Queen's closet
scene was another highlight.
Perhaps the most gratifying was
the final scene, which began with
the duel, so splendidly carried out
by Hampden and John D. Seymour.
Then the solemn grandeur of Ham
let's death was greatly enhanced in
that the stage was not left strewn
with royal corpses, and Fortinbras
did not make his anticlimactic en
trance; rather, the scene closed im
mediately on Hamlet's death, with
Horatio as his only companion.
Hampden's was an exceptionally
fine Hamlet, intelligent and consis
tent. What he lacked in youth and
spirit he more than made up in un
derstanding and maturity of playing.
The surrounding company was al
most uniformly bad, with Mabel
Moore rising above her surround
ings to give a thorough performance
of the Queen. P. J. Kelly's Polonius
was played for a maximum of hu
mor and an altogether pleasing
effect. —Chapin

VLADMIR HOROWITZ. Pianist
At the War Memorial Opera House
A capacity audience filled the Me
morial Opera House Tuesday night
to hear Vladmir Horowitz, beyond
question the greatest of the younger
pianists.
The program was in itself an in
teresting one, sweeping through the
history of piano technique and style
from Bach (as transcribed by Bu
soni) to Stravinsky. And the emo
tional range was equally wide: from
the mystic absorption of the second
Chorale to the drawing-room ele
gance of the Chopin Etude, from
Schumann's quiet weaving of ara
besques traced in the glowing em
bers of the hearth to the peasant
stampings of Stravinsky's Russian
Dance, from the humorous fancy of
Debussy's variations on Czerny's
five-finger exercises to the tragic
grandeur of Liszt's Funeral.
It is by now superfluous to speak
of Horowitz's bewildering technical
mastery, except to say that it be
comes more incredible every year.
But though, like Gieseking, and in
sharp contrast with Paderewski and
Gabrilowitsch, who rarely look at
their hands nowadays, Horowitz
seems all absorbed in the processes
of his playing, the resulting music is
always poetic and never showy.
The barrage of octaves in the cor
tege section of the Funeral appeals
far more strongly to one's sense of
skill; and by warm sincerity, Horo
witz transforms the technical diffi
culties of the Paganini-Brahms Va
riations into the poetry of pure
kinetic line, dynamic mass, and
rhythmic pattern. The "Lebewohl"
Adagio of the Beethoven Sonata il
lustrated Horowitz's tendency to
sentimentalize certain passages by
retarding the tempo excessively,
but the swinging rhythm of the Re
turn movement was beyond praise.
As an artist, Horowitz has
achieved before his thirtieth year
every feature of greatness except
philosophic depth and sublimity on
the one hand and some of the subt
ler aspects of romance on the other.

But these are qualities which only
time and richer experience can be
stow. Meanwhile we may rejoice in
the tenderness and grace, the fire
and steel of youth. —Clubb
