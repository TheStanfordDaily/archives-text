## VITRIOL DRIPS

The Editor, Sir:
Every so often a boil like Malloch
festers and has to be lanced.
It must be heartening to Stanford
I women to realize that worms of a
j certain type are determined to strip
our nation of even its present puny
protections; that their homes and
j children, because of such vermin,
will be at (he mercy of enemies who
will show neither kindness nor cour
j tesy when they knock on the door.
We of the Stanford R.O.T.C. grow
; tired of these senseless tirades; we
are willing to take the training of
our own i.ccord, quietiy and without
notice; what pay we receive is re
fund on University tuition, since 18
units of military courses (more than
! a quarter's work) are necessary to
complete the work.
Let us point out to the courageous
Malloch that, as a conscientious ob
jector, he will be excused from jeop
ardizing his infamous hide if v/e
have war.
George Washington, Abraham Lin
coln, Ulysses Grant, and Robert Lee
were soldiers; Malloch has proven
himself better than they. Let him re
appear once more with his talk of
dirty professions, professional mur
derers, and untouchables.
Until then we will worry along
without his aid. â€”Jiilson Peat tie.
