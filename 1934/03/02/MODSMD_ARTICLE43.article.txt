# MORE VITRIOL

The Editor, Sir:
How did Mr. Malloch pass the
University intelligence test? He can
justly condemn the breeders of war
that are so active in Europe and

' Asia, but when he makes a coward
j ly, scurrilous attack on our men in
1 uniform, he becomes infantile.
West Point and Annapolis accept
! only men of the highest type men
tally and physically—no Mallochs
j allowed. These men enter the serv
| ice because they enjoy the discip-
I line, outdoor life and interests of
j the work. As the first to die, mili
; tary men are the last to desire war.
They simply desire an adequately
l manned, trained, and equipped Na
tional Defense as an insurance
against future invasion by any one j
of our war crazed world neighbors. ■
Surely they do not wish to see the
j slaughter of our fellow-men.
Mr. Malloch also takes it upon
himself to insult garbagemen who
are only human after all and who
• are at least earning honest money.
I suggest that he insult the first sol
dier, sailor, or garbageman that he
sees. Then the fun will begin, but
not for Malloch.
| The irony of it all, a man like
Malloch insulting his betters! "Un- !
I touchables," yes, because the touch I
of Mr. Malloch on their uniforms i
would be complete defilement for
the wearer.
