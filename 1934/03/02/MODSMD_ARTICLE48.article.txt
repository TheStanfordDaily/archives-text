# WHY IT'S NEWS
## Unemployment and the New Deal 
### CROMPTON BANCS |r 
At this stage of the New Deal,
two things stand out. (1) There are
just as many, if not more unem
ployed than last month; (2) The
200,000 being dropped each week
from the CWA have not found jobs
elsewhere. As more and more of the
original lour million are dropped,
the situation will get worse and
worse unless something is done.
F. R. had hoped growing prosperity
and reviving industry would solve
the difficulty. So far they haven't.
It looks as if unemployment will be
with us for some time.
Roosevelt Still Hopeful
But F. R. is not discouraged. The
policy of his administration is one of
experimentation. At least the CWA
put four hundred million dollars
into circulation, helped business a
lot, and kept the wolf from millions
of doors. Since the same millions
will still be jobless on May 1
(CWA's last day). F. R. will try
something else in the hope that it
will work.
The New Plan
F. R.'s plan faces the facts more
squarely than any of his previous
unemployment relief schemes (di
rect relief, public works, CWA).
This one recognizes that there will
be several million jobless even after
prosperity returns.
The new program will start on
May 1 and continue for a year. It

recognizes three classes of jobless
(something new, too): (1) those in I
large cities and towns; (2) hard-up 1
families in the country and on
farms; (3) stranded workers living
in one-industry towns with no hope
of a job in the future —such as coal
miners in worn-out mines.
About 950 million will be spent on
the program during the year. There
will be no cash relief or dole. All |
the money will be spent on building
and improving public works, doing
various odd jobs, etc. In the coun
try, needy families will probably be
given enough land so they can feed
themselves. The jobs will last only
six months of the year.
Different from CVVA?
At first glance this looks almost
like the CWA slightly revamped. It
is almost like it, but not quite. The
CWA was for an emergency — to
carry the jobless through the winter.
F. R.'s scheme is part of a plan for
the future to take care of the per
manently unemployed. Brain-truster
Rexford Tugwell apparently had the
idea first, gave it to the President.
llow about the Cost?
Many Englishmen say the dole is
much cheaper than the CWA. They
are probably right. Last year Eng
land supported over two million job
less at one-fourth the cost per man
of the CWA. Also the CWA is very
