# Wilbur Gives Vocation Talk
## President Emphasizes Value Of Higher Education 
### 
"How far you get in the educa
tional field determines to a large
extent what you will do in life."
Thus did Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur,
president of the University, com
mend getting as much of an educa
tion as possible.
Dr. Wilbur last night gave the first
of a series of lectures by outstand
ing authorities on vocational sub
jects, to be given for the benefit of 1
senior students.
Few Enter College
Following out his topic, "Colleges
versus Professional Graduates in 1
the Business World," the speaker i
showed that only a small percent
age of students ever get as far as i
college, since a good many of them
are not equipped for an advanced
education.
Dr. Wilbur showed that once a!
thorough education was considered
either as a great luxury or else as
necessary only for preachers. Now,
however, our national life is becom- j
ing so much more complex that \
many students find that elementary ;
degrees are not enough preparation
in many lines. Consequently, al
most as many advanced degrees are l
given today as bachelor of art de
grees.
Post Graduate Work
The speaker said that, statistics
have definitely proved that future
earning ability and the amount of
education which an individual has
received bear a direct correlation, j
"Hence," said Dr. Wilbur, "it is
worth while, judging from experi
ence, to get more training after
graduation, particularly at a time
when there is a lessened demand
for men."
It was announced that former
President Hoover will be unable to
give the second lecture of the series
next week as previously announced; i
however, it is expected that he will '
speak in the near future. Other dis- 1
tinguished lecturers will follow.
