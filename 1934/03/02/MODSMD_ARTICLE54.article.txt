MORE ASSEMBLIES
LIKE WEDNESDAY S
Wednesday's all-University as- 1
sembly to hr.or Stanford's football
men was a step in the right direc- j
tion and we hope that there will be
several more steps taken in the near
future. Asicje from the awarding of
block "S's" and the Rally Commit
tee's efforts to arouse some enthus- !
iasm for a few of the football games l
in the fall, there's too little official
recognition of Cardinal athletes by
the Stanford student body
For the past several years, we've J
been hearing gripes about how ath
letics in general, and football in
particular, are over-emphasized in j
the colleges of this country. llow- j
ever, it would appear that most of |
the overemphasis comes from out
side sources rather than from the
student body itself.
STUDENTS EXPEND
LITTLE CASH, TIME
Outside of the players themselves,
the students spend little time or
money on athletics. The funds which
support the athlclic program of the
university come from the B.A.C.
which in turn derives its revenue,
for the most part, from football.
Football is largely supported by
people outside the university.
Athletics perform a service for
(he school in gaining favorable
publicity, and, in the case of
Stanford, at least in making pos- j

siblc a number of improvements
which include among other things
B ramie 1% Koble, the Women's
Gym, and the B.A.C. building
which houses the school of hy
giene and physical education.
Since they do perform a service
for the university, enough appre
ciation could be shown the ath
letes to honor them with an as
sembly to present them with their
awards.
CONFERENCE SCHEDULES
GET UNDER WAY
With the basketball team just
having completed its conference
schedule, two more teams open
theirs. Tennis got under way yes
terday when the racquetmen took on
California in the opening match of
the season. With Captain Chuck
Otis leading a team which includes
several names well-known to Pa
cific coast tennis followers, the
court team should have a good sea
son.
Coach Harry Wolter's baseball
team, closing a not too successful
practice season tomorrow, opens its
league schedule next Saturday
against St. Mary's. Although the
majority of the practice games were
lost, they served as a basis for val
uable experimentation and the In
dians should go into the conference
schedule with a fairly good chance
of coming out on top. California,
winner last year, looks like the
team to beat. â€”Tremaine
