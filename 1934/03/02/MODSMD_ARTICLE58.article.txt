# Babes Meet S.F.U. Frosh
## 
### 
Facing a San Francisco Univer
sity frosh squad of which little is
known or expected, Coach Bill El
lington's freshman cinder team com
petes in its second track meet of
the season tomorrow morning at
10:30 o'clock on the Angell Field
oval.
The S.F.U. yearlings boast a good
sprinter and another speedy distance
runnei*, but these Don babes will be
crashing a pair of Stanford power
houses, and Indians Chuck Voigt
and Rusty March are favored to
score five points in their respective
events, century dash and mile.
Besides March and Voigt, other
Stanford frosh performed well
enough against the San Mateo Jun
ior College team Wednesday to be
heavily favored against the Dons.
Among these marks was a 51.2
seconds quarter mile by Paul
Greene; 46 feet 2' j-inch shot put
by Jim Reynolds, 174 feet javeline
toss by Ray Williamson.
