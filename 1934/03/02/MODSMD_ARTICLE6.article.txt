# Camera Lumbers Into Decision Over Loughran
## 
### 
: MIAMI, Fla., March 1 (UP).â€” j
Primo Camera, Italy's man-moun
tain, successfully defended his
world's heavyweight championship
i here tonight by outpointing Tommy
| Loughran of Philadelphia in 15 slow
j rounds.
Despite an 86-pound advantage in
I weight, besides far greater height,
j the lumbering Italian was unable to
I score even a knock-down over the
| smaller fighter. Not until the closing ,
rounds when superior weight wore
the challenger down, did Camera
show to advantage. It was the 13th,
when Loughran was spent, that Car
nera first waded in and showed fire
and fight. i
