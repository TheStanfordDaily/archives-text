# CARDS, ALL-STARS IN PRACTICE BALL CAME TOMORROW
## 
### 
Plagued by an unusual amount of
hard luck, as far as winning games
is concerned, the varsity baseball
team will face A1 Erie's All-Stars
tomorrow afternoon on the home
diamond, hoping to break the jinx
by taking a victory in the last prac
tice game of the season.
Out of si>: games played to date
Stanford has scored only one win
and a tic. Three games were lost
by a one run rftargin after an early
lead had been nullified in last inn
ing rushes. However, there is reason
to believe that Stanford could have
scored victories in the above men
tioned three games if the original
starting teams had not been weak
ened by substitutions.
Coach Harry Wolter tried a new
infield combination which proved
successful in Wednesday's game
against the Kenealy Seals, which
the varsity dropped by a score of
5 to 4. The new lineup found
"Gabby" Galbraith at third base in
place of Frank Tremaine, and Ed
Clark at second in the place of
Jim Woolley, veteran letter-man
on last-year's varsity.
Another departure from the usual
order of things was in the outfield
where Coach Wolter played only
three men instead of the customary
six, who have shared the duties in
the past games. The starters Wed
nesday were Bob Hamilton in left,
Jim Moserip in center, and Captain
Dick Miles in right.
The game will start at 2:30
o'clock. Admission is free.
