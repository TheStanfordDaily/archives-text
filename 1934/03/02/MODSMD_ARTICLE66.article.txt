# Card Alumni Pay Homage To Founders
## Elliott, Cornish to Talk On Farm's History 
### 
Founders' Day approaches. This I
clay of days draws Cardinal kin to- j
pother; here on the campus we shall ;
celebrate in the true spirit of the
founders.
Last year members of the Class of i
1930 returned to a first alumni con- |
fcrence; this idea has grown into an
established function of the Alumni |
Association, with the conference [
this year planned for March 10 and
11. A pioneer, Rev. Louis Cornish, j
'94, of Boston, will be in the Memo- I
rial Church pulpit that Sunday.
Elliot Speaks
The official spokesman for the au- !
dience of the air over KPO during j
the University hour Monday will be j
Dr. Orrin Leslie Elliot, registrar
emeritus. Present when Senator
Stanford expressed his ideals of ed- |
ucation at the opening of the Uni- 1
versity in October, 1891, Dr. Elliot !
has watched the dream come true; j
he will speak on the theme, "Le-
Jand Stanford, Builder and Bene- j
factor." i
A brief survey of observances I
since the year the University first [
decided to set aside a day to com- j
memorate the Stanford family, will
bring out many interesting side- !
lights concerning the early days, as,
well as picturing the development j
of Stanford. The first celebration, in
1891, was on May 14, Leland Stan- |
ford Junior's birthday. There were j
no automobiles in those days; so the
entire University, faculty and stu
dents, took the train to Monterey
for a picnic.
After the debate of Senator Stan- :
ford in 1893, Founder's Day was j
changed to March 9 to commemorate j
the birthday of the senator. The i
only year since 1901 that the Uni- j
versity has not observed the birth i
of Senator Stanford was in 1905, j
when the annual Founders' Day
came nine days after the death of
Mrs. Stanford.
Founders' Day in 1917 also marked !
Ihe 25th anniversary of the found- I
1
ing of the University. An address I
by Dr. Jordan, who laid the corner- 1
stone of the Union, was the main !
event in 1922; a year later the Un
ion was formally opened. The 1933 j
program was broadcast over a 400- j
meter wave-length station set up by
the engineering department.

After the debate of Senator Stan- :

changed to March 9 to commemorate j
the birthday of the senator. The i

of Senator Stanford was in 1905, j
when the annual Founders' Day
came nine days after the death of
Mrs. Stanford.

by Dr. Jordan, who laid the corner- 1

Elliot Speaks
The official spokesman for the au- !
dience of the air over KPO during j
the University hour Monday will be j
Dr. Orrin Leslie Elliot, registrar
emeritus. Present when Senator
Stanford expressed his ideals of ed- |
ucation at the opening of the Uni- 1
versity in October, 1891, Dr. Elliot !
has watched the dream come true; j
he will speak on the theme, "Le-
Jand Stanford, Builder and Bene- j
factor." i
A brief survey of observances I
since the year the University first [
decided to set aside a day to com- j
memorate the Stanford family, will
bring out many interesting side- !
