An Encina youngster was driving
through the hills in the afternoon
with his Roble heartthrob.
Bang! The left rear tire had passed
its days of usefulness.
Emerging from the front seat, the
Encina lad climbed into the rumble I
seat of his cabriolet and pulled the
cover down. His Roble lass played |
a jack, as she mournfully sat upon
the running board.
Along came another Stanford fel- i
low, who gallantly stopped and prof
fered aid.
Fifteen minutes later, soiled and
hot, the lire changed, he turned to
receive thanks from—Stanford man
number one, who nonchalantly
emerging from the rumble seat
smiled his thanks and drove merrily j
off with his fair companion.
