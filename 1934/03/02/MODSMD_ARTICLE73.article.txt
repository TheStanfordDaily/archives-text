# Originality Strikes Keynote Of Newest Spring Fashions
## Paris Adopts Winds Of Freedom for 1934 Silhouette 
### 
Springtime at Stanford — richly
colored flowers in the Union Court,
delicate blossoms in front of Roble,
a tree-shaded Row, and the red tiles
of the Quad washed clean by rains
that are filling Lagunita. The stage
is set and Fashion is ready.
The winds of freedom have been
adopted by Miss 1934—-she has an an
imated, breezy style ihat was blown
straight from Paris with gay new
colors and vivacious lines. Her
spring dresses are streamlined with
the grace of the latest automobile
or airplane, and they move with a
rhythm that repeats the lively tem
po of modern times.
Fashion has gone feminine this
spring, but not in a languorous way.
Everything is fresh, youthful, and
dainty. There are flowers for our
hats, bright bandeaux for our curls,
and ruffles for our most business
like dresses. In fabrics, it is a sea
son of imagination and originality.
Silk is dyed to look like fur, and
real fur is shown in gorgeous shades
of green, rose, and blue. Cottons are
worn on the tennis courts and in the
ball room, while wool challi is the
latest material for formals.
Hats go completely berserk and
win first prize for being different,
with their 57 ■ varieties. There is
the perfect hat for everyone this
season as the mode can adapt itself
to each individual. The Easter Pa
rade will exhibit off-the-face bon
nets that show curls in front, tai
lored Breton sailors with their edges
perked up, and wide-brimmed hats
that display a decided "pirate in
fluence." Straw will be completely
in fashion for the spring millinery
for the first time in several seasons.
Little can be said about the new
styles without mentioning the neck
wear. Women are taking it on the
chin this season with all kinds of
bows, collars, and ties, emphasizing
the front face. There is endless va
riety here—all the way from deli
cate lingerie touches of cobweb silk
to tailored pique. In between is the
ever popular frill of organdy. Such
simple accessories as the new neck
wear change the plainest dress into
something new and exciting, in
keeping with the freshness of spring.
The silhouette is definitely new—a
forward sweep in the daytime and
a backward one for evening. Ruf
fles and flares bring out the wind
blown effect which is the keynote of
the stylos.
Headliners for the season are the
suits—you can manage to wear a
jacket fiock for every hour and
every activity of the day and night, j
Navy blue is the leading color, es- J
pecially when combined with lighter
shades of heaven and baby blue.
Bright colors are good for sports
and pastels arc shown for evening. ]
The spring styles of 1934 are sur- J
prising, even daring in their new i
lines and contrasts. They are femi- i
nine but particularly symbolic of j
the speed of today. In other words, !
they make women completely allur- ;
ing but unmistakably 1934.
