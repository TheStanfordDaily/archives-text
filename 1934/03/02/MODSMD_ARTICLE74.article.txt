## 
### 
Katharine Hepburn, forecasting
Ihc shoe styles of the season, nc
glectcd to give the United States a
break when she stated that shoes
should look British for sports wear,
Continental for street wear, and Pa
risian for evening.
For sportswear she favors a wing
lipped brogue in a stout, grained
leather with a flexible sole. For
town wear her wardrobe includes
suede and calf combinations featur
ing the high-riding silhouette.

Windblown clothes will not be ac
companied by a revival of wind
blown coiffures. A more formal
method of arrangement will be in
vogue for daytime as well as eve
ning wear.
