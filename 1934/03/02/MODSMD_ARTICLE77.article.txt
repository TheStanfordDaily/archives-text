# "Wide Open" Sandals Will Be Season's Favorites
## 
### 
Wide open as the Barbary Coast
used to be are the new sandals the
co-eds will be sporting this spring,
and if early sales are any indication,
this type of shoe should be the most
popular of the new styles.
Lacking most of the heel, as well
a*, featuring little toe, this footwear
has rightly earned its title of the
"Wide-Open Shoe." I f could almost
be described as a combination nule
and sandal.
Important is the fact that these
shoes will be used for sport and
street wear as well as evening attire.
