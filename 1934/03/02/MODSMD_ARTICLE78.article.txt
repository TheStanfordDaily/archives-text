# TUXEDOS REPLACED BY WHITE JACKETS FOR SPRING FORMAL
## White Palm Beach Cloth Is Favored 
### 
The most original of Stanford
| gentlemen—or roughs dressed up—
will appear at formal dances this
| spring and summer in a double
breasted, white tuxedo of Palm
Beach cloth, with trousers in black
of the same material.
Judging from current opinion,
however, the man who desires to be
the most properly equipped for so
cial affairs will own one of the in
creasingly popular mess jackets in
troduced during the summer months
of last year.
Even this last attire will have
added to it something entirely new
in the broad "cummerbund," or
sash, of the South American vari
ety, which will take the place of a
vest. It comes in blue, maroon,
wine, or deep purple, and is shown
with pockets.
Returning to the more conven
tional in formal evening attire, the
most, popular will be a single
breasted coat with 'peak lapels and
satin facing, instead of the double
breasted model which gained favor
this winter. Dull finished lapels will
still be seen quite often.
As for the cut of the tuxes this
year, little has changed, except pos
sibly more broad shouldered coats
and more smigly fitting trousers,
with a plain satin braid matching
the coat instead of the former one
of braid.
Perhaps the most radical change
in the entire formal will be the
white vest, which has received
widespread endorsements by styl
ists. Long in discard, they have at
last received official sanction if they
are tailored in double breasted
models. The black single breasted
vest still is popular.
As the warm days approach, how
ever, the mess jackets, and white
Palm Beach coats should appear in
constantly increasing numbers.
Accessories that will be popular
included the two stud shirt again,
and the bat wing tie, although some
French end ties are being shown.

Leading designers stress the fact
that haid should suit both the face
and the occasion. They point out
that elaborate masses of curls, while
appropriate on the dance fiooi\ are
not suitable for the tennis court, and
vice versa..
