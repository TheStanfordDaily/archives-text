# SILHOUETTE IMPORTANT IN SPRING MODES
## 
### 
Silhouette is an all - important
, feature of spring styles, judging
i from the fuss that is being made
! over it. The silhouette, however, is
1 justly important in any fashion,
. since it- determines the trend of the
1 seasbn.
It is first of all, a graceful silhou
ette that Miss 1934 will display this
spring. No more mannish shoulders
â€”fullness has dropped down around
the elbow and lower arm with an
| alluring effect.
Waist lines are not wandering, but
I stay put very nicely, and skirt

lengths, despite all the flurry from
Paris over a revival of the knee
high atrocities, retain their present
becoming length. These are mid
calf, ankle, and floor lengths de
pending upon the time of day and
the type of dress.
As for this much discussed wind
blown effect that has fluttered into
fashion news. What it really means
is that for daytime, fullness is to
ward the front as if there were a
strong wind behind you. At night,
the opposite is true, and ruffles and
flares go backward.
