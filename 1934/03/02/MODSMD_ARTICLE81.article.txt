# Paris Decrees Liberal Style In New Suits
## Jackets Range in Length From Full to Bolero 
### 
Good news for the Stanford co-ed |
| whose purse has that lean and hun
j gry look: according to the latest re- !
ports from fashion-wise Paris, this '
season's styling in coats and suits !
is so diversified that almost any type j
j sport clothes will be the mode this j
, spring.
I Every length of suit jacket will |
be seen, ranging from full length ;
| coat to the bolero jacket. And as for
the coats, straight - line, belted,
swagger, wrap-around, reefer, Eng- 1
lish top, all will be equally chic.
But a word of warning concerning
the popular windblown style. Good
| as this is right now in this country,
I Paris has already decreed it passe, \
j and two months hence the French- j
featured pencil silhouette will pre
j dominate.
This pencil silhouette is a slim, j
straight line, with a possible slight '
! tucking at the waist, and is expected
to set the fashion the next few
| seasons.
As to colors and materials, these,
1 two, are exceptionally varied. For j
dressy suits navy seems to be lead- i
ing the field, with black a close j
second. Another successful shade;
I is Runco brown, a color that owes \
i its popularity to the fact that it j
! blends so well with the brown and j
1 tan tints.
The featured materials for these
suits are Forstman's "cedar bark,"
crepes, and subdued tweeds,
i Leading color for tweeds ensem
bles seems to be green. Any cast of
| yellow flecked with brown is also j
| good, and light blues, beiges, and
i grays complete the array.
What kind of blouse will be cho
! sen depends primarily upon the suit
| itself.
