# In the Mode

Another fashion edition has come,
is about to go, and still Milady of
the Stanford campus will dash
breakfastless to her 8 o'clock in last
year's dress, all too luminous make
up, and not a sign of that smart new
coiffure she had the night before.
And Monsieur the Rough will leave
his newly acquired tweeds at home
and appear in familiar but ancient
cords.
No wonder professors seldom
recognize their students when
they meet socially. There is too
great a tendency not to mind what
one wears to class and to con
centrate all fashion interests in
clothes for dates and parties. A
little more care and thought with
Quad appearance — a little less
clinging to old and unbecoming
traditions—that is the best fash
ion advice of the season.
Imagine our perturbed feelings
when it came to writing about cock
tails dresses! It is such a nasty
word hereabouts and such a smart
style everywhere, that we felt sim
ply devastated at the necessity of
changing the name of this attractive
fashion to something more respec
table.
From Paris comes the word about
a style that sounds ideal for the
Stanford campus. It seems that real
poker chips and dice are going to
be used as buttons on the new
sports frocks this spring. Now why
hasn't somebody thought of that be
fore?
There are enough poker chips
in Encina to outfit every Roble
freshman with a neat row of six
or seven buttons up the back and
down (he front. To.von and Bran
ncr would willingly supply the
Union, and How inhabitants could

take care of each other. In order
' not to cheapen the style, good
i fashion psychology would be to
attach a sentimental value to the
I chips. The women would then
' covet them as tokens of male es
teem, and imagine the honor that
would go to the girl of whom it
was said, "The face that launched
I a thousand chips."
! The wearing of dice as buttons on
! campus frocks is also an admirable
mode and would go a long way to
ward keeping the girls' minds off
marbles, jacks, and other seasonal
[ temptations. When lecture hours
i are long, all one would have to db
' is detach a couple of buttons from
• one's dress and go in for a little
j crap shooting with the boy in the
I next seat.
Nudist colonies must be silent
i places. Women are said to be the
I more talkative sex, and it is esti
mated that almost half of their
conversation is about clothes. So
i what does Milady of the nudist
colony find to talk about these
! spring days unless it is what
shade of tan will be worn this
season.
Paris is pretty far away from
! Stanford and sometimes we feel
i more than a little glad. The imme
diate danger of its more startling
i styles invading the campus is not
] very great. For instance, it is doubt
ful if many co-eds will take to
wearing black organdy overcoats
this spring, fur lace is not exactly
"in," and so far the men have not
i adopted the Boy Scout short for
| sports.
Spring is here! The campus is
waiting — the Mexican influence
and the Garbo tendency; Parisian
creation and the Hollywood inspi
' ration—we welcome them all!
