# LINGERIE FOLLOWS SMOOTH, NEW LINES
## 
### 
The new silhouette cannot be i
really successful unless the lingerie '
worn underneath follows slim, I
straight lines. Underthings should I
be smooth with no fullness except j
in slip skirts which flare slightly to '
emphasize the windblown tendency. J
The rustle of taffeta that sounds j
so mid-Victorian seems slated to
come into its own again. Taffeta pet- I
ticoats (one could hardly call them 1
slips) are the newest fashion revi- j
val. They fire far from the kind that \
grandmother wore, being cut to fit:
smoothly over the hips with slight i
flares and are finished with ruchings. J
They will be worn under daytime !
and evening dresses.
Smart foundations garments are j
cut slimly, and made of soft, yet i
flexible materials in order to give an I
uncorseted effect. Some kind of a :
foundation is practically a necessity, j
however, with the new silhouette.

The dresses in the Paquin col- !
lection recall 3900 fashions. Checked ;
taffeta, neck ruches, flounces, and |
feather trimmings are all present.
