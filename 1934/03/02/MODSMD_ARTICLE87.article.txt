# Details That Hint Spring
## 
### 
The first signs of spring are not
robins and pussy-willows. By these
details shall you know the new sea
son is here:
Fitted-at-the-waist evening coats
â€”very tailored and sophisticated.
Formals with necklines that are a
bit perilous in front, but so conser
vative in back.
Gay, woolen pompons worn as
trimming on campus sports dresses.
Effective lingerie touches of mus
lin and organdy that add a note of
the romantic feminine to the most
severely cut dress.
Gloves with cuffs of material to
match the costume.
