# New Costume Jewelry Gets Wide Acclaim
## Many Colors Apparent In Revival of Popularity 
### 
Costume jewelry comes back into
the mode after an absence of two
or three years, and is scheduled to '
play an effective part jn spring
styles.
For sports wear, colors are gay,
showing the red-yellow-black com
bination that is attributed to the
Mexican influence. Wide composi
tion bracelets in vivid colors add a
new note to spectator sports cos- |
tumes, while clips and earrings in
matching shades complete the out
fit.
Fpr afternoon and evening, jew- I
elry also comes in colors, but the ,
mqre subdued and delicate ones;
that harmonize with the popular j
pastels. "Fragonard" is the name of j
this time, and it owes its inspiration '
to the eighteenth century paintThgs
of a French artist. Dainty little
flowers of rose, jade green, and yel
low, surrounded By rhinestones, are t
the feature of the delightful new
jewelry which is available in brace- ]
lets, hair bandeaux, earrings, and '
clips.
Old gold that looks like the metal
of an aristocratic heirloom is the
material of another costume jewelry
innovation. The plain leaf design
makes it a mode of dignified sim
plicity and one that is suitable for
both daytime and evening wear.
Tiaras are not quite what they -
were this winter, fashion has de
creed. Although still popular, the
newest head ornaments do not stand â€¢
very tall and are more on the ban
deaux type. Their place in dress has
been extended to daytime wear. i
