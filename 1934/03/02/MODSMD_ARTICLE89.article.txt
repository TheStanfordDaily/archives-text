# Individualism Gives Variety in Hats
## Personal Taste Will Make Shopping for Millinery Easy This Spring; Youth, Recklessness Featured In Widely Differing Offerings 
### 
The new hats are brimful of in
terest! Whichever way you Hip the
fashion coin it's "heads," or what
you decide to wear upon them.
Hats are perhaps the giddiest, light
est, most casual things of millinery
history, they are headlights and
highlights of a proper spring cos
tume.
It does seem that you can never
get to the end of the millinery style
story this season. Some have brims
upturned; some have crowns worn
far back on the head; some have
brims with more or less sheltering
lines—all are youthful, even rock
less. Among the favorites are the
wide sailors that roll up at the very
edge of their wide brims — some
what like a sombrero. Disk sailors
and sailors with brims that swoop
interestingly are also very much in
the millinery picture.
And what's more, this spring—or
any time at all now —you can wear
hats to suit your own fancies. We
need no longer look alike. You can
spot your Aunt Em immediately, or
find a young face under a hat that
requires courage to wear; for that
great stride toward individualism
someone should be decorated.
Adventurous souls will grab the
new big hats. But don't forget about
the saucy sailor—a flat pancakish
creation that rests lightly on the up
per legions of the skull. And if you
insist upon something medium, you
can still look chic with medium
brim, medium crown, and a medium
amount of exposure.
But first look at the Diadems,
baby-face turbans, off the face brim
types, windblown rolls, pirate ef
fects, sleek tailory treatments, and
derivations of the sombrero. There
are picture hats, berets with turned
up brims in the back, ribbon caps
with fiat loops in the form of stun

ning eye-shades in the front, brims
that run up on one side, all-flower
turbans—and that is only a small j
part of the tale.
Besides being a season of indivi
dual hats, this is a season of trimmed
hats —by which we mean facings
and ribbons, flat bows massed to
gether, all kinds of feathers and
flowers, lace, and clips used in a
very deliberate and important man
ner.
And the media are just as varied
as the styles and brims. There are
as many different fabrics as there
are straws, in addition to straw fab
rics and combinations of straw and
fabric. There are flattering concoc
tions of new straws, novelty straw 1
and silk mixtures, and get-togethers
of silks of contrasting colors.
In other words, the principal idea
is to get something that is "fair to ]
thee" and something that will carry I
out the general theme of your cos
tumes. You don't need to dread the
business of selecting your bonnet to
wear in the Easter Parade.

fashion coin it's "heads," or what
you decide to wear upon them.
Hats are perhaps the giddiest, light
est, most casual things of millinery
history, they are headlights and
highlights of a proper spring cos
tume.
It does seem that you can never
get to the end of the millinery style
story this season. Some have brims
upturned; some have crowns worn
far back on the head; some have
brims with more or less sheltering
lines—all are youthful, even rock
less. Among the favorites are the
wide sailors that roll up at the very
edge of their wide brims — some
what like a sombrero. Disk sailors
and sailors with brims that swoop
interestingly are also very much in
the millinery picture.
And what's more, this spring—or
any time at all now —you can wear
hats to suit your own fancies. We
need no longer look alike. You can
spot your Aunt Em immediately, or
find a young face under a hat that
requires courage to wear; for that
great stride toward individualism
someone should be decorated.
Adventurous souls will grab the
new big hats. But don't forget about
the saucy sailor—a flat pancakish
creation that rests lightly on the up
per legions of the skull. And if you
insist upon something medium, you
can still look chic with medium
brim, medium crown, and a medium
amount of exposure.
But first look at the Diadems,
baby-face turbans, off the face brim
types, windblown rolls, pirate ef
fects, sleek tailory treatments, and
derivations of the sombrero. There
are picture hats, berets with turned
up brims in the back, ribbon caps
with fiat loops in the form of stun

ning eye-shades in the front, brims
that run up on one side, all-flower
turbans—and that is only a small j
part of the tale.
Besides being a season of indivi
dual hats, this is a season of trimmed
hats —by which we mean facings
and ribbons, flat bows massed to
gether, all kinds of feathers and
flowers, lace, and clips used in a
very deliberate and important man
ner.
And the media are just as varied
as the styles and brims. There are
as many different fabrics as there
are straws, in addition to straw fab
rics and combinations of straw and
fabric. There are flattering concoc
tions of new straws, novelty straw 1
and silk mixtures, and get-togethers
of silks of contrasting colors.
In other words, the principal idea
is to get something that is "fair to ]
thee" and something that will carry I
out the general theme of your cos
tumes. You don't need to dread the
business of selecting your bonnet to
wear in the Easter Parade.
The new hats are brimful of in
terest! Whichever way you Hip the
fashion coin it's "heads," or what
you decide to wear upon them.
