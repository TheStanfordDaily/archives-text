# Roble Maidens Tell About Row Serenade
## 
### 
The inside story of the band which
was rudely dispersed by Gordy Da
vis one night last week was re
vealed when one of the attractive
Robleites who live on the second
floor broke down and confessed.
The story goes that eight Phi Delts
who were feeling especially roman
tic serenaded the young lady with
"The Stars and and
other snappy tunes. Finding their
efforts unappreciated by Roble, they
proceeded to greener fields.
The Sigma Chi house was greeted
with the melodious strains of
"Sweetheart of Sigma Chi" on the
way up-the Row. The serenaders
found a hasty retreat lrom the Deke
house advisable, since their har
monious attempts were greeted by
the well-known water bags.
Sadly discouraged, the eight em
bryo Tibbetts found appreciation at
the Theta house until their happy
state was interrupted by the callous
campus "cop" Gordy. Sad, too, since
there is so little of the joyful and
songful in life.
