# He-Man Trend Is Noted in New Spring Fashions
## Men Will Go Masculine In Rough, Rugged Style Tweeds for Campus Wear With Belted Backs Are Shown 
### 
Stanford roughs, long proud of
their reputation for being the worst
dressed men in the country, are
likely to lose this hard-won title, for
no matter how rough I heir attire this
season they will .siill be in fashion.
The "sheik" is no longer chic this
year. The big, rugged he-man is the
well dressed man of 1934. Clothes
fit in a loose, easy manner, and rough
fabrics hold sway.
For campus, rough, rugged tweecLj
,ire the thine, .some of ihcm so coarse
lli.it they would ordinarily be used
lor overcoats. And not only are
they rugged in texture, but in many
cases they feature bold patterns, such
as the strong checks that come from
the country districts in Scotland.
Flannel sport coats are passing out
of the picture, rough tweeds and
ihetlands replacing them. There are
a variety of sport-bark models being
shown, some with yolks, some with
shirred backs, all with an easy swing.
A new feature of these coats is the
all-around belt many of them are
showing, popular* because it allows
one to button the belt and leave the
coat open. This not only gives a
swagger appearance, but is also much
cooler.
A variety of pockets are shown
with these models, and all the coats
have leather buttons. Another nov
elty is a tab under the collar so that
!he coat may be buttoned at the
neck.
As to color, brown, blue, and gray,
are good, as well as a few novelty
pastel shades. Light camel hair
shade, worn with darker .slacks, is a
new and very popular combination.
This is called "light on dark," and is
the reverse of former years.
Slacks tend to the peg-top models,
with full pleats in front and open lap
seams on the sides. Checks are re
placing stripes, and solid colors are
still good, especially gray, tan, and
brown, as well as the pastel shades.
In dressy suits the double-breasted
trend is gaining in popularity every
year, and patch pockets are also in
high favor. The three button, single
breasted, very soft front coat with
patch pockets is another smart
model. The coat is slightly longer
than in other suits, and the soft
Shetland fabrics are the ones fea
tured.

Spring coiffures are shorter, off the
face, and with curls extending \ip
the back of the head. If shingled, the
hair features a diagonal waved ef
fect.
