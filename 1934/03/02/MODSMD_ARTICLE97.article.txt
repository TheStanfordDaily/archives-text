# Coats Have New Ruffles
## Latest Color in Furs Is Dyed Navy Blue Fox 
### 
Fashion nonchalantly puts ruffles
i on coats and makes them so very
: new that last year's is not. in the
; running and will never do.
On furless coats, these ruffles are
; made of the fabric and stitched to
emphasize their flare. When fur is
j used, it covers the revers and rip
j pies in the most approved wind
| blown manner across the chest. j
The very newest color in furs is j
: the dyed navy fox which is tre-
J mendously effective when used as
the border of a monk's collar. The
j soft lines of this kind of collar keep
â€¢ the fur away from the face yet
draw flattering attention toward it. |
The exaggerated shoulder line of |
last year's coats is no more. The !
i upper sleeve is simple, flaring out at !
the elbows and narrowing down to i
j a close, neat-fitting wrist,
are straight, there is an abundance i
of dressmaker details such as tuck
ing and fancy stitching to add in
! terest.
For campus wear, the most prac
j tical selection would be a three-
I quarter length trotteur in a neutral ;
I shade or white. White promises to
hold its own as the very best color
for resort wear and is being shown
in a variety of materials and styles. I
Many of the new white coats arc ,
unlined.

Scarfs are among Ihe most impor-
I tant accessories. The smartest ones
are plain, but fascinating effects can
ibe attained by combining various
shades of the new spring pastels.

Spring style collections show a
, tendency toward cravat type silks
I in black and navy blue.
