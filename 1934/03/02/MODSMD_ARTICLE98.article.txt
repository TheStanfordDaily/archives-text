# CONSIDER COLOR IN HOSIERY SELECTION
## Blending of Stockings With Ensemble Important 
### 
Springtime means new clothes, and
new clothes mean new stockings. In
planning i costume hosiery shuuld
be one of Ihe first considerations, not ;
just as an incidental item.
Color itself is not the most im
portant factor but the possibilities I
of the stockings blending with the ■
ensemble should be considered.
That is, if you intend to buy biege j
stockings, of course select the ( correct i
lone of the season, but it is even j
more essential to decide if it is the
beige which will blend most satis
factorily vith your outfit.
As blue is the most fashionable
color this spring, taupe is the most '
important group of hosiery hues. The
many different shades 01" this color j
blend best with the various shades of
blue.
The most outstanding of all is me
dium taupe. This tint goes best with
navy blue, with the lighter-than
navys dark enough for street, and
with green. It is also the smartest i
choice for gray.
If you are going to major in prints j
this season, you'll like beige-taupe j
with Ihem.
Those who wear black a great deal i
and like Ih:■ effect of a darker stock- j
ing will want a still darker taupe. j
But the medium shade goes with
more spring costumes and thus is
more practical if you can't have a |
large supply.

The bell, or balloon, sleeve, is one j
of fashion's latest favorites. When
done in a thin print or sheer, it gives !
ihe following line so necessary this
season.

White ermine will be used to ex- j
press the season's "windblown tend
ency on the new black woolens. i
