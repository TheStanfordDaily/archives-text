# Sportswear, Traditional on Campus, Still Featured for Classroom
## Co-eds to Use One and Two Piece Frocks 
### 
Let's go to class! Whether you
plan to spend your spring afternoons
in chemistry laboratories, in theLibe,
or on the lake, it is everyday Quad
clothes that .should be more impor
tant to every co-ed. And until a
freshman iearns the devastating ef
fect that one of the gay new knitted
outfits can have on a section leader,
she has much to discover about col
lege life and Bawlout averages.
Campus clothes should be of the
sports type. High heels have no place
on the Quad, and low-heeled oxfords
or sandals are the best choice for
co-ed footwear. 11 you like sweaters,
this is a grand season for them. The
twin sets are slated to be as popular
as ever and come in luscious shades
that go perfectly with the new skirts
which show a decided variety. Some
are tweed, ethers corduroy, but the
majority of the wonl ones have a pat
tern of some sort. Checks are good,
and gay plaids on a white back
ground are a sure sign that your
skirt is the latest thing. A smart cos
tume for Quad is the plaid skirt with
a matching blouse of plain color.
In one-piece dresses for campus,
the shirtwaist frock and its varia
tions are almost traditional. Becom
ing to all, il is being shown in bright
woolen with both long and short
sleeves. For warmer days, it is fea
tured in the new necktie and wash
silks. Pin-point stripes and tiny
checks are often used as patterns in
these materials.
Linens .ire going to come into their
own later in the season, according to
advance and resort showings. A
grand campus coat is the new un
lined trotteur that is three-quarter
length and can be worn over any
thing.
Hats that go to class should not be
elaborate nor be-flowcred. The most
appropriate style is the tiny knitted
cap in blight colors or white that
can be twisted in any shape.
