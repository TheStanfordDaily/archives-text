Sll MILK
AT YOUR DOOR
m I every morning
Bounce out of bed . . . drink a glass or two of miik . . . and go to
class feeling like the proverbial "Million dollars."
Drink It Every Day!
For refreshment, for sustenance, for pleasure, milk is
the most satisfactory of all liquid foodsâ€”the only liquid
that has a real food value.
