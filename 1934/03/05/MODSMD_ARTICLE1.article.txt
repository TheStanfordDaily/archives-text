### 
Stanford students receive their

purchase tickets for Saturday's all-
University track and field meet when
the; ducats go on sale at the A.S.S.U.
office and within the various campus
living groups. Tickets may be bought
for 25 cents upon presentation of a
-student body card and all students
are urged to buy, with Friday as the
deadline, as only half dollar paste
boards will be obtainable on Satur
day, this being the regular admission
price. m
i Skull and Snakes, men's honorary
society, is sponsoring Saturday's af
fair on Angell Field and every cent
of the gate receipts goes into a fund
to send Stanford's tx'ack team to
Philadelphia for the 1.C.4A. compe
tition in May.
Entry Fee Charged
Captain Gus Meier, chairman of
the committee for staging Saturday's
meet, announced yesterday that any
one attending Stanford was eligible
to compete and that in order to raise j
additional money, each entrant will j
be charged 25 cents. Meier also stip- j
ulated that such entrants should sub- ■
mil their names and fees to him by
this Wednesday.
All present members of the track j
team and till lettermen of previous (
years are automatically entered. All !
others must be entered by their or
ganizations to be eligible to run.
With such graduates as Ben East
man, Les Hables, Bill Miller, and
Norm Bright .slated to compete j
against ths regular Stanford varsity j
and frosh teams, Saturday's affair |
begins to assume the proportions of i
a miniature Olympic Games. Big'
Ben coasted through a 48 seconds j
flat quarter mile last week and ap- j
pears to be completely recovered i
from the leg injury that restricted
his competition to the sidelines last
year.
Big Ducks Slated
Hables, Miller, and Bright are all ;
training hard for the contest and l
should be in the best of shape on j
Saturday.
Several great duels are on top for j
next Saturday's meet. In the pole j
vault, Bill Miller, Olympic chain- 1
pion, and Bud Deacon of this year's |
squad, have both been flirting with ;
14 feet tnd can go higher. Abe !
Hables will need to call on all of his |
resources to lead Carl Thorns, prom- j
Lsing soph sprint star, to the tape in j
the short sprints.

Another great race appears cer- !
tain in the 120-yard high hurdles I
between Captain Gus Meier and Srai i
Klopstock, sensational sophomore 1
timber topper. Last Friday in a time j
race, Klopstock beat Meier over the j
distance by half a yard in the myr- !
velous time of 14.6 seconds. This j
mark is almost phenomerial when it
is considered that the accepted
world's record for the event is little !
better than a half second faster.

Diamonds worn pcrfcclly round j
have been found in the bottom of a j
Borneo whirlpool.

With such graduates as Ben East
man, Les Hables, Bill Miller, and
Norm Bright .slated to compete j
against ths regular Stanford varsity j
and frosh teams, Saturday's affair |
begins to assume the proportions of i
a miniature Olympic Games. Big'
Ben coasted through a 48 seconds j
flat quarter mile last week and ap- j
pears to be completely recovered i
from the leg injury that restricted
his competition to the sidelines last
year.
Big Ducks Slated
Hables, Miller, and Bright are all ;
training hard for the contest and l
should be in the best of shape on j
Saturday.
Several great duels are on top for j
next Saturday's meet. In the pole j
vault, Bill Miller, Olympic chain- 1
pion, and Bud Deacon of this year's |
squad, have both been flirting with ;
14 feet tnd can go higher. Abe !
Hables will need to call on all of his |
resources to lead Carl Thorns, prom- j
Lsing soph sprint star, to the tape in j
the short sprints.

Another great race appears cer- !

timber topper. Last Friday in a time j
race, Klopstock beat Meier over the j
distance by half a yard in the myr- !
velous time of 14.6 seconds. This j
mark is almost phenomerial when it
is considered that the accepted
world's record for the event is little !
better than a half second faster.
