LE BOURGET AIRPORT, Paris,
March 4 (UP). —Anxiety grew to
night for Dieudonne Coste, French
air ace and transatlantic flier, miss
mg on u flight to Copenhagen, Den
mark.
The air ministry announced at
midnight that all airdromes in north
ern Europe reported they had no
news of Coste, who left here at 12:10
p.m. Saturday, and it was feared he
may have got off his course and fal
len into 'he North Sea or the Baltic.
Coste notified the authorities at
Copenhagen that, he expected to
reach there last night, and dispatches
expressing concern for his safety
were received here from the field at
the Denmark capitiil. They reported
the airdrome lights had been kept on
all last night in the hope Coste,
missing the field, might return look
ing for it.
Accompanied by Maurice Bellonte,
Coste made the hazardous Paris-to-
New York flight over ihe Atlantic on
September 2, 1930 —his most spec
tacular feat. It was the first non
stop flight from Europe to the Amer
ican mainland.
Coste flew the South Atlanlic in
October. 1927, and he and Bellonte
in their famous ship, the "Question
Mark, 1 ' held the non-stop, straight
line distance record for a while after
flying from Paris to Tsitsihar, Man
churia.
