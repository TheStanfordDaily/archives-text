# Herbert Clark Hoover Is Private Citizen One Year
## 
### RUSSELL PAINE 
Stanford's first student and most
distinguished graduate, Herbert C.
Hoover, has been in private life ex
actly one year.
Hoover is the only ex-president of
the United States living, and he is
one of the few presidents to retire so
completely to the status of private
citizenship following defeat in pub
lic service.
His health is "very good," states
his private secretary Paui Sexson.
Reading t ho papers is a.s closely as
he has followed politics during the
past year, Sexson says. Except for a
few fishing excursions and walking ;
across football fields during half
time periods to sit on the Stanford
side, Hoover has hit the headlines

but a few times. He has,, in fact,
made particular effort to remain out
of the public eye.
"We are not discussing any public
affairs," Sexson declared when asked
if Hoover had any political plans for
the future. He has made no definite
plans as to what he will do as a pri
vate citizen.
Hoover is well known for his ac
tivities a.s .student at Stanford. When
the University was first opened, he
obtained a job registering students
and a.s a matter of course registered
himself first. He thus became the
first student at Stanford, although
probably ,vith no idea that he would I
sometime be the most distinguished
graduate.
