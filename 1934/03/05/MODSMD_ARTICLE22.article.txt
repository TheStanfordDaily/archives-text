and Benefactor."
Dr. Elliott took his Ph.D. at Cornell
University in 1891, when he came to
Stanford as registrar. He held that
position until 1925, when he retired.
He is the author of several books,
among them being "The Tariff Con
troversy in the United States in

Thereabouts," and "The Things That
Abide."
Among the builders of California,
Leland Stanford holds a high place
and he was for many years the state's
foremost citizens with wealth, power,
and high honors. Dr. Elliott believes
that these things do not come to a
plain country man unless he happens
to possess unusual qualities, and ex
ercises them to full advantage.
Dr. Elliott in his talk will enu
merate these qualities possessed by
Leland Stanford and the use the for
mer senator and governor of the
state made of them in order to at
tain his high position. Dr. Elliott will
also tell of the planning and build
ing of the University, the difficulties
and opposition encountered, and
Senator Stanford's final success in
building *he University of today,
known and respected throughout ihe
world.
