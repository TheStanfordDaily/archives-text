### 
CROWN POINT, Ind., March 4
(UP). â€”America's No. 1 enemy, John
Dillinger, roamed the country again
today with a machine gun in his
hands and ready to fight to the death
with any of hundreds of possemcn
who hunted him throughout the
midwest.
Roving companies of soldiers, po
licemen, and volunteer possemen
sought Dillinger in Illinois, Indiana,
Ohio, and other states, and squads
of officers raided more than 250
places in Chicago in an effort to pick
up the trail of the desperado who es
caped yesterday from the Crown
Point, Ind., jail, where he was held
on charges of one of the many mur
ders he has been accused of.
Dillinger had spent days fashion
ing a toy pistol. Using the safety
razor blade, which reach him in some
unknown manner, he carved a stick
of wood to resemble a small caliber
pistol, made it black with shoe polish
and attached the safety razor handle
so that it resembled a pistol barrel.
Cowing guards with ihe toy gun,
Dillinger herded them into cells and
locked them in, then obtained a ma
chine gun from the jail arsenal, held
up Turnkey John Kowaliszyn and
got keys for the outside doors.
