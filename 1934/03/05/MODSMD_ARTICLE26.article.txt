### 
The rigors of army discipline
were brought home with a bang
to the Scabbard and Blade ini
tiates who stood cold and home
less before the doors of (he va
rious living groups of women
last Friday morning.
From 5 to (i a.m. they stood
guard, two at Itoblc, and one
apiece at the sorority houses,
the Union, and the other cam
pus dormitories. In the chill

dows of the houses were dark,
the doors closed, and silence
reigned undisturbed. Not one
of the "800" stirred, not an eye
rested on the manly sentinels so
faithfully protecting the Stan
ford maiden.
It was past the hour of (i when
they were finally relieved by
the commanding officers, Phi
lippe Gamier, Alan Kelsey, and
Calvin Emcis, and allowed to
steal oIT to bed for an hour so
so before the daily grind of
classes began.
