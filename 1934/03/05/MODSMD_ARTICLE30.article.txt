# LEADERS FLAY ORCHESTRA AT MILITARY BALL
## Gordon Heche, Bob Clancy Criticize Inferiority Of Off-Campus Band OTHERS DISSATISFIED Musicians Charged With Being Pick-up Group 
### 
Stanford dance music circles cre
scended a few notes over
the week-end when local dance band
leaders saw too little harmony in the
idea of employing an off-campus or
chestra for the Military Ball Friday
night.
Orchestra leaders charged that
Friday night's orchestra was not a
"New York Night Club Orchestra"
as advertised, but a pick-up band
that used musicians from a San
Francisco local, one of whom "dished
hamburgers" in Mcnlo Park every
day.

Saying: "I think outside orchestras
are very fine in their way, if a well
known orchestra that plays in some
big hotel is obtained," Gordon Heche,
pianist and former orchestra direc
tor, objected to the employment of
musicians that did not show a clear
superiority to local players.
Orchestra Leader Bob Clancy said:
"I think we ought to educate people
in charge of campus aances to give
work to campus men." Clancy
claimed ihat in the long run the out
side non-union orchestras were no
cheaper because of booking fees and
traveling expenses added to the cost,
and they were usually inferior be
cause they had not had the long
practice together and organization of
the campus men.
Though declining to be quoted
other dance orchestra leaders agreed
unofficially with the sentiment of
Heche and Clancy.
Kendall Speaks
Chairman of the Military Ball
Committee Nat Kendall said, "As
far as I know, the orchestra is
from New York. We got the band
through the National Broadcasting
Company, which said it was a New
York orchestra."
Claiming not to be a judge of the
aesthetic merits of the different or
chestras, Student Manager Les Ha
bles said: "It was the committee's
money, rind if they were satisfied
they got their money's worth and if
the students were satisfied, as far as
I'm concerned the matter should be
closed.
"The fact that they were or were
not a New York night club orchestra
ha.s no bearing on the case as long as
the music was satisfactory."
