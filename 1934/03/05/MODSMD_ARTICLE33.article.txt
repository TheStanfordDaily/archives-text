# Trackmen Should Go East
## 
### 
Stanford's trackmen have been literally stabbed bv
I heir own spikes, in regard to their hoped-for trip to Phila
delphia late in May for the annual 1.(1.A.A.A.A. classic, but
they hope to be able to patch a few wounds Ibis Saturday
when they stage a benefit All-('diversity meet to build
funds for the invasion.
The slabbing, if we may call it that, occurred because
of their prowess and reputation. Los Angeles this spring
is sponsoring the National Collegiate A.A. meet, which
means that University of Southern California brought that
important affair to the West. Needing outstanding athletes
to insure the success of their undertaking, the Trojans ex
pected Stanford to be one of the supporters.
Authorities on this campus naturally expected to assist
in any -way they could, and the best way was to enter the
Cardinal stars in the N.C.A.A. even if that association's
meet has not been entered by Stanford in the past.
In accepting the financial obligations connected with
sending a team south, the Board of Athletic Control was
forced to cancel any arrangements for an Eastern excur
sion in the same year. But Captain Gus Meier and his men,
with the assistance of Skull and Snakes, think that Sons
of the Red should be allowed to participate in the classic
which has come to be monopolized by three California
schools in the last decade.
Coach Dink Templeton already has said that the In
dians stand better than an outside chance of winning, that
his dual meet team will not be as strong as his 1.C.4-A. or
N.C.A.A. entries.
In the last six years, Stanford has won the 1.C.4-A. three
limes and has given U.S.C. a strong battle for the first place
in the others. Templeton thinks the Cards can step out
and take another championship. So does the campus.
The campus has its opportunity this week to give the
trackmen a chance for that trip and another shot at K1
Trojan. Participants in the all-University meet are paying
their own way into the meet. If they are willing to donate
to a cause which not only helps them but gives students
an interesting afternoon, surely the roughs and coeds can
put out 2f> cents apiece in return.

N.C.A.A. entries.
In the last six years, Stanford has won the 1.C.4-A. three
limes and has given U.S.C. a strong battle for the first place
in the others. Templeton thinks the Cards can step out
and take another championship. So does the campus.
The campus has its opportunity this week to give the
trackmen a chance for that trip and another shot at K1
Trojan. Participants in the all-University meet are paying
their own way into the meet. If they are willing to donate
to a cause which not only helps them but gives students
an interesting afternoon, surely the roughs and coeds can
put out 2f> cents apiece in return.
