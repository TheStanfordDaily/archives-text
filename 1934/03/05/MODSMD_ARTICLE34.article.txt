"Politics" is a horrid word, and as such is frowned upon
in many circles. Yet wlfere there is government in the
ionise of democracy, there are elective olliccs to he filled
••Hid there are candidates competing with each other for
various posts, hacked by their own factious and telling the
electorate how good they will he if they get "in." There
you have it: politics.
Election time at Stanford has iu recent periods been a
rather hectic, turbulent affair, with even your best friend
with his ear to the ground and afraid to tell you. Within a
few months, another such event will he at hand, will) the
June elections for everything from A.S.S.I'. president to
sophomore man on the Executive Committee. Looking for
ward with dignified restraint to the happy all-University
party, the Daily lakes time out momentarily to quote from
a recent passage in the Daily Tar lleel editorial columns,
our North Carolinian contemporary.
"Within a relatively short time the student body will go
to the polls and elect campus-wide officers. What those
ollicers will do or will not do after the election, the stu
dent body does not know. Neither, we suspect, does any
one else.
"For a momentary glance at the system of government
by which the student body runs itself reveals an utter lack
of system. We do not elect officers to till positions in a
co-ordinated frame of government. . . . Why not make it
possible for the student body to know what it is they are
voting for in campus politics? Why not let politicians
know what they are supposed to do after they are elected?"
Kcmcinber, the quotation comes from North Carolina,
not Stanford. But it doesn't do any harm at all to reprint
it here and to realize that the same shoe often fits more
Hum one foot.
When we start thinking about accepting the revised
A.S.S.I'. Constitution, which will be completed soon; let's
be sure that we have a form of student government that
Stanford can truly be proud of.
