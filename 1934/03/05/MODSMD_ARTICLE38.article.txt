MACBETH
! At the Columbia Theatre
I
I Walter Hampden as "Macbeth"
' produces an earnest solid perform-
I ance of which the only criticism can
| berthat his style of acting involves a
i bit more "noble ram" than we are
I accustomed to see. His voice is a
j beautiful instrument used excel
' lently by an exper*, his gestures
: good, though a trifle over-theatrical,
i and certain individual scenes done
with remarkable beauty.
! The play as a whole was rather
1 badly mismanaged. While artificial
' division into three acts is perhaps a
; necessity in the modern theatre,
j more pains to keep chronology evi
: dent, and some indication of the
place where certain scenes are laid
should afforded in order to do the
j play real justice. The direction erred
i badly in a few places, noticeably in
| the scene of Banquo's murder, when
! one murderer stood looking on at the
! crime with Fleance beside him and
made no effort to stop the boy when
:he fled. This is inexcusable, of
j course.
1 Other details equally as surprising,
; but of more arguable benefit, were
! several odd scene endings including
' the end of the play. Macbeth died
| on the stage, and in a minute the
curtain fell, while the faithful hailed
Malcolm.
| This ending may have been mo-

I tivated by the fear that with Hamp
den gone the audience would walk
J out, a fear justified by the acting of
the rest of his company. The only
! exceptions to this were Mable Moore
as Lady Macbeth, and Ernest Rowan
i as Macduff. Miss Moore is excepted
[ because of a sleepwalking scene
] which was the highlight of the eve
! ning and a really good characteriza
j tion throughout. Mr. Rowan is ex
i cepted because he was so bad that
| you can't call him an actor. The rest
j were practically uniform in bad dic
j tion and unintelligent interpretation.
Mechanically the production left
; a good deal to be desired. It is to be
i expected of a touring repertory
t group that their sets will not be
elaborate or new, but it did seem
i that these were more than usually
I decrepit. â€”Benet
