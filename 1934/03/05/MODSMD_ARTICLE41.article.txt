The Editor, Sir:
All this war argument since the
tank appeared on the campus re
minds us again that life is just one
disillusionment after another.
First we discover there isn't any
Santa Claus. Next wo learn that the
World War was not fought to make
the world safe for democracy. And
today we are told that during the
next war we can't march along with
our buddies and sing "Parley Voo"
because deadly disease bombs will
be exploding on us right here at
home.
Is nothing sacred? Maybe there's
a chance that Patrick Henry and
Nathan Hale didn't make those glo
rious speeches. Maybe they were
nothing but myths invented by ghost
writers, the history textbook au
thors. Shucks!
One of these days us kids are just
going to grow right up and suffer
another disillusionment. We'll figure
out that every war ever fought was
nothing but a scheme to fill the pock
ets of privilege.
Incidentally, how will the. capital
ists be able to enjoy the next war
they start? —what with those disease
bombs exploding on their homes.
Disarmed, —Elmer Dethlefs
