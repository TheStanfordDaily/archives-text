The Editor, Sir:
I love 'he way General Nat Ken
dall defended his blatant propaganda
for the Military Bali. Ii was typical
of the military spirit, excess emo
-1 tionalism und entirely devoid of rea
son. His defense of himself was a
vitriolic at the weak-minded, cow
ardly pacifists (and right after Stan
ford has been awarded the Peace
Plaque — aren't you ashamed?) a
j contemptuous reference to students
who blow off steam in Campus Opin
i ion and a touching bit of sentiment
on the valiant little tank and its "bit"
in the war. No doubt he would like
to take the faithful little creature to
bed with him.
I, one of the breecf, thrill to see a
few Rex Beach heroes yet left in our
decadent age of softies. I also love
to see some of our youths drilled for
four years in the most economical
1 methods of slaughter. The only thing
j I do not understand is why they do
( not make the course more thorough.
Instead of wandering about the

Quad three days a week in nice
1 clean uniforms and dainty riding
boots making the hearts of co-eds
flutter, they should wallow about in
, a mixture of mud and blood, sleep on
rocky ground, eat rotten food, starve
themselves at intervals, refrain from
i bathing, and draw lots to see whose
: entrails and whose brains are to be
strewn about the polo field for their
i weekly trial battle. Then they would
| be truly ready for the wars for which
they so ardently train. As it is, I
think their present cuiTieulum inef
, l'ectual and a bit illusory.
In short, I consider the R.O.T.C. a
symbol of moronic fatuity. It is an
| economic waste in that it greedily
consumes capital and produces no
j want-satisfying good.* I think it
1 should be exterminated along with
! Chicago racketeering. Anyone who
! enrolls for it for reasons other than
escaping tedious P.E.. courses, is
' either a stupendous fool or a de
-1 praved sadist. Sincerely,

to see some of our youths drilled for
four years in the most economical
1 methods of slaughter. The only thing
j I do not understand is why they do
( not make the course more thorough.
Instead of wandering about the

Quad three days a week in nice
1 clean uniforms and dainty riding
boots making the hearts of co-eds
flutter, they should wallow about in
, a mixture of mud and blood, sleep on
rocky ground, eat rotten food, starve
themselves at intervals, refrain from
i bathing, and draw lots to see whose
: entrails and whose brains are to be
strewn about the polo field for their
i weekly trial battle. Then they would
| be truly ready for the wars for which
they so ardently train. As it is, I
think their present cuiTieulum inef
, l'ectual and a bit illusory.
In short, I consider the R.O.T.C. a
symbol of moronic fatuity. It is an
| economic waste in that it greedily
consumes capital and produces no
j want-satisfying good.* I think it
1 should be exterminated along with
! Chicago racketeering. Anyone who
! enrolls for it for reasons other than
escaping tedious P.E.. courses, is
' either a stupendous fool or a de
-1 praved sadist. Sincerely,
Owen Ulph
