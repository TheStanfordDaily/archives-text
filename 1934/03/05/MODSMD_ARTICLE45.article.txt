# SIDELINE SLANTS..
## POTENTIAL STRENGTH SHOWN AT LONG BEACH 
### 
An indication of Stanford's track
strength was shown Saturday after
noon at the Long Beach relay when,
with only two men entered, the In
dians took two first places. Johnny
Mottram, competing in his favorite
event, threw the javelin farther than
he ever has before, reaching 215 feet
4V2 inches, while "Slinger" Dunn
pushed the shot 50 feet 4 :, /j inches.
Dunn did not compete in the discus
which is his be.st event.
Dink Templeton sent only Mott
ram and Dunn south to the relays,
but had he chosen to send a full
squad, Stanford probabably could
have run up a very respectable total
with such men as Lyman, Deacon,
Meier, Klopstock, Kingsbury, Wil
liams, and Zaches competing. As it
was, U.S.C. took most of the points
with its strong relay team.
