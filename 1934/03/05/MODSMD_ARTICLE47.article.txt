# CALIFORNIA HAS HOOP GRIPE
## 
### 
From the editorial column of the
Daily Californian comes a grip?
blaming Stanford's upset of the Bear
basketball team on poor officiating.
While we will agree that the offi
ciating during the past basketball
season was pretty awful in spots, we
would hardly go so far as to blame
the loss of a game on it.
Says the Californian, '"About 10
fouls before the Bears could get off
their sweat suits had much to do
with the spirit of the California
quintet, as did over-anxiety and ill
luck. Together these handicaps gave
Stanford the game." As for anxiety
for victory, the Indians were pi'ob
ably just as anxious to win, having
lost 10 straight games to California.
Looking at the figures of the game
which Stanford won 34 to 20, Cali
fornia committed 16 fouls to Stan
ford's 12, while Stanford made 12
points on her free throws to Califor
nia's 8. A difference of four personal
fouls between two teams isn't a great
deal, certainly not enough on which
to blame the loss of a game in which
the margin of victory is 14 points and
in which the winning team played a
superior brand of basketball, a point
on which most of the newspapers
which covered the game agreed. It
is also noticeable that California
made no alibi for the officiating in
the game on January 20, although
the same men were *n charge of that
game, but California won.
