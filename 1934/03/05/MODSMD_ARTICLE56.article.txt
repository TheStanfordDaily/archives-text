# CARD NINE CLOSES PRACTICE SEASON WITH 2-0 VICTORY
## 
### 
The varsity baseba" team scored
a 2 to 0 victory over A1 Erie's All-
Stars Saturday in the last practice
game of the season before the Cards
sweep into the conference competi
j tion which gets under way Thursday
! when they meet St. Mary's at Mo
iiaga.
Hamilton Scores
Stanford pushed runs across the
i plate in the first and last innings of
i the game. In the initial frame, with
| two out, Bob Hamilton scored on
Captain Dick Mile's triple for the
I only earned run of the game. In the
: last half of the eighth the Cards
j nailed down the victory by counting
again when Bo'oby Grayson scored
j from second base when Maloney,
All-Star second satker, erred on
' Hamilton's ground ball.
More noteworthy than the victory
itself was the superb job of pitching
turned in by Fred Heringer, who
i held the hard-hitting All-Stars to
; six scattered blows without allowing
j a single man to cross the rubber.
I This fine performance by Coach
| Harry Walter's big right - hander
gives added impetus to Stanford's
j hopes for a Conference champion
| ship.
Heringer, Anderson Slated
The brunt of the mcund work will
j probably be borne by Stan Ander
j son and Heringer in the fortheom
i ing race, both having shown in the
j practice gsmes this season that they
; are capable of winning plenty of ball
j games if given proper support by
J their mates.

Stanford pushed runs across the

i the game. In the initial frame, with

Captain Dick Mile's triple for the
I only earned run of the game. In the
: last half of the eighth the Cards
j nailed down the victory by counting
again when Bo'oby Grayson scored
j from second base when Maloney,
All-Star second satker, erred on

More noteworthy than the victory
itself was the superb job of pitching
turned in by Fred Heringer, who
i held the hard-hitting All-Stars to
