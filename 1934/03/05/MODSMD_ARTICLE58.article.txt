i
Coach Nort Thornton's Stanford j
freshman swimming team narrowly j
defeated f he San Jose State varsity
in a dual meet in the Eneina pools •
Friday afternoon, 45-3 G.
Stanford went into the last event,
the 300-yard medley relay, with a 3-
point lead. San Jose easily won the
race to tie the score at 42-42, but the j
Spartan back stroker disqualified his I
team with an illegal turn.
Don Peterson stood out for the j
frosh. He won the 440-yard free
style event in 5 minutes 33.8 seconds,
nearly 18 seconds under the Califor- j
nia-Stanford freshman record. The
blonde Indian yearling came back j
after a few minutes' rest and barely
won the 220-yard free style. He also j
aided in i Stanford relay victory.
With the exception of Peterson's •
two winning races, and the 400-yard ,
relay, in which he assisted, the visi
tors captured every event. Stanford 1
made up in points, however, by tak- ;
ing the majority of seconds and
thirds.
