# DR. ROBERT SWAIN ON RAPID TOUR OF EUROPEAN NATIONS
## Plans to Visit International Chemistry Congress 
### 
Dr. Robert E. Swain, head of the
chemistry department and vice
president of the University, left last
week-end for an international con
ference of chemists in Madrid and
a rapid tour of central and southern
Europe.
The selection of Dr. Swain as one
of 12 scientists asked to represent
America at the conference in Spain
is indicative of the high ranking po
sition this Stanford leader holds
among world scientists. He is a
member of several International
councils of chemists, including the
one which is sponsoring the confer
ence.
Before attending the Madrid con
gress, Dr. Swain will go first to Ber
lin, will tour the chemical industrial
districts of the Ruhr, the upper
Rhine, and the Saar Basin, and will
attend another congi'ess of chemists
in Paris from March 26 to April 1.
At the close of the conference in
Madrid, April 11, he will tour south
ern Spain, northern Italy, and the
Austrian Tyrol, stopping at Vienna,
Budapest, and Bucharest. Before re
turning home in the middle of May,
he also expects to have visited the
leading industrial districts of Po
land, both in the Corridor and that
land lying near the Russian border.
In making the tour, Dr. Swain will
be primarily interested in the eco
nomic development of the countries
he visits.
