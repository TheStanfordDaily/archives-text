# Elliott Praises Character of Sen. Stanford In Radio Talk
## Country Boy Who Became Senator and Governor Lauded for Work 
### Emerson Honan 
Leland Stanford, senator, gover
nor of California, and founder of
Stanford University, was a plain
country boy who rose to a position
of wealth, power, and high honors
through xhe exercise of common
sense, sound judgment, indomitable
energy, and the ability to inspire
confidence in his associates.
This, in brief, was the context of
the speech given by Orrin Leslie El
liott, registrar emeritus of the Uni->
versity, wno last night was the fea
tured speaker on Stanford's series of
educational programs sponsored by
the National Broadcasting Company
and presented every Monday eve
ning over radio station KPO.
C'omcs to California
Born on an Eastern New York
farm, Senator Stanford's education
amounted to the equivalent of a
high school course plus a three-year
apprenticeship in a law office. He
was admitted to the bar at the age
of 24, and began to practice in Port
Washington, Wis. Four years later
his office and valuable law library
were destroyed by fire and he de
cided to come to California, where
the gold feCer was at its height and
his five brothers were already mak
ing a huge success of merchandising.
Intensely interested in politics,
Leland Stanford joined the small but
rapidly growing Republican party.
He was defeated for state treasurer
in 1857 and for governor in 1859, but
in 1860 he stumped the state for
Lincoln, who was nominated, and in
the following year was elected the
first Republican of Cali
fornia.
Railroad President
Governor Stanford became presi
dent of the Central Pacific soon after,
and his business sagacity and quali
ties of leadership were the out
standing factors in the successful
completion of the read. Driving of
the golden spike at Promontory,
Utah, on May 10, 1869, was hailed in
California as one of the notable
events of the state's history.
The death of Leland Stanford, Jr.,
at the age of 16, was the most crush
ing blow that ever came to the Stan
fords, but from that blow arose the
determination of Governor Stanford
to build a monument to his son
which would be of the greatest serv
ice to California and to humanity.
Governor Stanford at first thought
of the University as being concerned
chiefly with engineering, agricul
ture, and the useful arts, but this
original idea was soon expanded to
include "all other things necessary
and appropriate to a University of
high degree."
Dr. Elliott concluded: "Leland
Stanford is assured of a permanent
place in the history of the state
through the influence of this monu
ment which will carry the Stanford
name down the years in widening
circles of jippreciation."
