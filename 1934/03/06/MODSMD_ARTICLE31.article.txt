### ELIZABETH CHAPIN 
new in dramatic readings is promised for Thursday night,
when Masquers, women's honorary society, presents Artiuii' Schnitzler's
"Anatol" as its maiden effort in the realm of reading-sponsoring.
The play is unique in that it is divided into seven short sequences, each
with a different leading lady, and thus offers opportunity for a large num-

► ber of the members of the organiza
| tion. These scenes are all skillfully
| constructed, and they vary in mood
| from quiet pathos to raucous mirth.
I The reading is under the general
direction of Marion Jones, Masquers
president, who has 1 lie difficult job
S of synchronizing the action of the
piece.
Among t lie most important of the
women east are Jean Albertson and
I Katrina Wallingford, who are re
membered for work in previous
J readings.
Miss Albertson", in addition to her
j last quarter's debut in "Arms and
the Man,'' appeared in "Hay Fever"
j and recently read th»? leading femi
nine role in "Let 'Em Eat Cake."
1 She will read Gabrielle, perhaps the
! most difficult role, to which she
should bring an undeniable finesse.
Wallingford Work
Katrina Wallingford's work in the
lead in "Hay Fever" is perhaps the
| outstanding piece of reading to be
I done by any woman student this
I year, and she is expected to infuse
; her part of Mimi with the same de
i lightful comedy.
I The two male roles which run
through the play are those of Anatol
j and Max. Robert Brauns, whose
reading af the lead in "The Critic"
| attracted much favorable notice, will
| be seen ;-is Anatol, the gentleman of
\ many affairs.
Sandoc Is Comic
James Sandoe, the Throttlebottom
of "Let 'Em Eat Cfcke" and the
j "Richard II," will read the comic
role of Max, something of a depar
, ture for him, in which he should pro
| vide much comedy.
Virginia Marvin, of "Arms and the
Man" and "She Stoops to Conquer,"
will appear as Hilda, while Shelley
Smith—last seen in "Distant Drums"
—is Emily.
Two leading-debuts mark this
performance: those of Mary Ann
Crary and Eleanor Harris, who ap
pear as Elsa and Bianca. The tem
' pestuous role of Lona will be read
by Harriette Hall, of "Hay Fever"
j and the Gaieties.
The reading begins promptly at
