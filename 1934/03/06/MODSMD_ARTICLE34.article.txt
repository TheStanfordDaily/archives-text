# Why Personalities?

The Daily has watched with great interest the Campus
Opinion columns in the last week in which quite pointed
words have been used in decrying Rolph Malloch. We
raise the question, "Why do you oppose the man instead
of liis argument?"
Practically every opinion to date has made some ref
rence to the author of the argument in a light which has
been unfavorable. As a matter of fact, he is quite as hu
man as those who have been criticizing him.
The Daily is not attempting to defend him as a person.
Nor does it think his approach of the subject the best
treatment. Hut we do contend that Malloch has the germ
of an argument which has, for the most part, been com
pletely overlooked by his opponents.

Admittedly, there are two sides to the question of mili
tarism in colleges. All colleges, however, do not require
students to learn war tactics. Stanford is one of those
institutions. Men enrolled in Reserve Officers' Training
Corps work here do so of their own volition. At stale uni
versities throughout the country, military training is part
of each man's required curriculum.
Rut those men don't have to attend state schools. There
are other institutions which can offer them what they want
in their chosen professions, and they can thereby steer free
from any unwanted "garbageman's work." Maybe they
unwittingly making cannon fodder of themselves. Maybe
I hey are smart in preparing for times of war, in order that
by having an intelligent understanding of military maneu
vers they can draw a better job and work behind the lines
instead of looking down the mouth of a big gun.
This much can be said for "militarism in schools":
Basic military training is not so much the art of war, but
lather the art of submitting gracefully to discipline. We,
the college youth of America, need this quality.
Pacifists who base their arguments on theory have a
logical ground when they suggest that a complete, simul
taneous disarmament by every nation in the world would
bring about peace. Rut there lies a difficulty.

If we mav switch from theory to practice, would any
of those nations even consider such a move, particularly at
the present time? In the background of all this squabble
's the economic side of the question, one involving the
holdings of huge interests whose expansive foreign pos
sessions have been pointed out as one reason for interna
tional strife, ft may look fine in writing to propose the
immediate banishment of all arms, but how would if look
when the replies came in?

We realize that Malloch is of socialistic tendencies. It
may be that this is his means to an end which as yet has
not been revealed. lie is not alone in his beliefs about
governmental setups. The world is inclining toward at
least some of the policies put forth by such able men as
Norman Thomas.
If this argument is to continue in the (wampus Opinion
section, why not bring it around to whatever is being
driven at and discuss the subject more than the indi
vidual ?
