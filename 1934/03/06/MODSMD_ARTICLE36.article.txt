# Bringing Home the Bacon
## 
### 
Stanford's barnstorming debaters, returning to the
Farm after a two weeks' lour, have brought the Fniversity
to tlie limelight once again.
No-decision debates held throughout the southland re
sulted in a long list of audience approvals. Moral victories
were all the men were able to achieve, but to the extent
that these constituted the fruits of victory they gathered a
clean sweep.
Willi the lour complete, they came home like ruggers,
cagers, and poloists with Ihe i r lion's share. They deserve
the same commendation.
