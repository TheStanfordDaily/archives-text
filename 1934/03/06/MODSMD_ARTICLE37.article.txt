## F.R. AND THE 3 R'S 
### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
Roosevelt has been in office a year.
Probably no other President has ac
complished so much in so short a
time. Probably no other President
has had the popular support F.R. has
at his command. Now at the opening
of his second year, he is beginning to
get some organized opposition. This
opposition revolves around the
meaning of three avoids: Recovery,
Reconstruction, Revolution.
Recovery
Recovery means the return of
prosperity in the usual way, without
changing our economic life in any
way. This has always happened
since our country began, but we did
very little to help it along. The point
us that we always recovered—with
changes each time, but they just
happened. There was little if any
effort at national or state economic
planning.
Now F.R. entered office in the
midst of the greatest peace-time
crisis in our history. Everybody
wanted recovery, and this was the
President's first concern-- to recover
from the depression.
Reconstruction
Here is where the New Deal comes
in. Economists in general have no
ticed that depressions are getting
worse and worse. Obviously there
are causes for this. Reconstruction
seeks recovery whila at the same
time trying to eliminate or soften i
depressions by economic planning.
To do this, the NRA, the AAA, and
other groups were started. Their
first job was to get the" country out '
of the woods of depression; their
second task was to control industry
and agriculture so as to make hard
times less likely. In order to do these
things, the powers of the Federal
Government had to be enlarged. I
Now here is the point. Nearly
everybody favored these measures
for the duration of the emergency at j
least. But there were quite a few
who feared for the safety of Ameri
can institutions if the NRA and AAA,
etc., became a permanent part of our
economic structure. These people
were not a majority, but a very
strong minority. This was the rally
ing point lor the opposition.
Revolution
For some time, ultra-Conserva
tives have feared a revolution in !
America which would do away wivh
the old order and substitute a new.
At present certain editors and con
servatives of both parties claim the
country is going Communist or Fas
cist or both. They propose a new
party to uphold the Constitution
against these supposed influences.
But thoy are really confusing the
situation. The New Deal is not Revo
lution. Few people want that. The
New Deal is based upon the existing
institutions. Remember that the Con
stitution is a highly flexible docu
ment. Here are a few examples.
The U.S. budget is based finally
upon the earnings of private prop
erty and individuals. The whole
F.R. program supposes that these in
stitutions will continue intact. Even
the NRA r<nd AAA machinery had
its roots in trade associations, cham
bers of commerce, trade unions—all
good American institutions.
So we i.re now gelling Recovery
plus Reconstruction, but not Revo
lution. If Roosevelt is successful he
will join Washington and Lincoln; if
not, he will have made an earnest
effort.

very little to help it along. The point
us that we always recovered—with
changes each time, but they just
happened. There was little if any
effort at national or state economic
planning.
Now F.R. entered office in the
midst of the greatest peace-time
crisis in our history. Everybody
wanted recovery, and this was the
President's first concern-- to recover
from the depression.
Reconstruction
Here is where the New Deal comes
in. Economists in general have no
ticed that depressions are getting
worse and worse. Obviously there
are causes for this. Reconstruction
seeks recovery whila at the same
time trying to eliminate or soften i
depressions by economic planning.
To do this, the NRA, the AAA, and
other groups were started. Their
first job was to get the" country out '
of the woods of depression; their
second task was to control industry
and agriculture so as to make hard
times less likely. In order to do these
things, the powers of the Federal
Government had to be enlarged. I
Now here is the point. Nearly
everybody favored these measures
for the duration of the emergency at j
least. But there were quite a few
who feared for the safety of Ameri
can institutions if the NRA and AAA,
etc., became a permanent part of our
economic structure. These people
were not a majority, but a very
strong minority. This was the rally
ing point lor the opposition.
Revolution
For some time, ultra-Conserva
tives have feared a revolution in !
America which would do away wivh
the old order and substitute a new.
At present certain editors and con
servatives of both parties claim the
country is going Communist or Fas
cist or both. They propose a new
party to uphold the Constitution
against these supposed influences.
But thoy are really confusing the
situation. The New Deal is not Revo
lution. Few people want that. The
New Deal is based upon the existing
institutions. Remember that the Con
stitution is a highly flexible docu
ment. Here are a few examples.
The U.S. budget is based finally
upon the earnings of private prop
erty and individuals. The whole
F.R. program supposes that these in
stitutions will continue intact. Even
the NRA r<nd AAA machinery had
its roots in trade associations, cham
bers of commerce, trade unions—all
good American institutions.
So we i.re now gelling Recovery
plus Reconstruction, but not Revo
lution. If Roosevelt is successful he
will join Washington and Lincoln; if
not, he will have made an earnest
effort.
Roosevelt has been in office a year.
Probably no other President has ac
complished so much in so short a
time. Probably no other President
has had the popular support F.R. has
at his command. Now at the opening
of his second year, he is beginning to
get some organized opposition. This
opposition revolves around the
meaning of three avoids: Recovery,
Reconstruction, Revolution.
Recovery
Recovery means the return of
prosperity in the usual way, without
changing our economic life in any
way. This has always happened
since our country began, but we did
very little to help it along. The point

changes each time, but they just
