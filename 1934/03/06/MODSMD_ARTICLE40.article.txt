FASHIONS OF 1934 (Warner Bros.)
At the Stanford Theatre
This film is a melange of many
levely* young ladies, a sickeningly
over-dapper and ultra-deft William
Powell, and some clothes. I suppose
the producer thought he put a plot
in too, but he was wrong; the action
consists of a series of simple swin- i
dies with Powell as head swindler
and Bette Davis as his faithful as
sistant who hopes her love will make
him go straight at last. That set-up,
familiar to all picture-goers, is han
dled with a little less than average
ease in this version.
The girls and clothes, though, are
quite beyond reproach, and you will
not be disappointed if you go solely
to see the pretty pictures. The
dances are a little more salacious
than usual and consequently not
quite as dazzingly splendid, but there
are some beautiful effects, aided by
seme rather good music.
The comedy is supplied by Hugh
Herbert and Frank IvlcHugh. Those
who liked Herbert in his earlier ap
pearances will wish he had more to ,
do in this, but he has a few very
fine moments. McHugh gets a better
break, and, though he has no new
stuff to offer, is just as funny with
that silly laugh as he ever was. But
it would take more than these two
humorists to keep this picture from
dragging badly in places, notably
when the principals are on the
screen.
With someone other than Powell in
the leading role it might have been
pleasant entertainment. —Benet;

MASSACJIE (Warner Brothers)
At the Mountain View Theatre
In "I Am a Fugitive," in-spite of j
the exaggeration, onr- was sincerely ,
moved and righteously indignant at I
I

the sufferings of Paul Muni. But
"Massacre" defeats lis own purpose
by piling the agony too high. Dur
ing the funeral of White Horse's
father, who was wilfully neglected
by the reservation doctor, and while
the Indian agent is cheating White
Horse out of his inheritance, White
Horse's sister is raped by the under

taker, who also swindles the family
in the matter of funeral expenses.
By this time the spectator's indigna
tion and sympathy has turned to
skeptical disbelief.
For some reason, Bavthelmess, who
is a reserved, sincere, and compelling
actor, has surrounded himself in re
cent pictures with a pall of gloomy
propaganda—first the poor southern
white trash, then the unemployed
war veterans, now the mistreated In
dians. If Ave must tiave propaganda
in films, it ought to be subtle enough
to have a subconscious effect, or at
least straightforward and honest
enough to be credible. —Brauns
