FOUL GIIIPE
California, evidently pretty hard
hit over the loss of the southern di
vision basketball title, has another
gripe to make, this time over Sam
Barry's accusation that Nibs Price
was spoiling the game by drilling his
Bear players in "footballistic tactics."
The Bear Facts Column of the
Daily Califomian for March 1 claims
to have proof that the Trojans were
rougher than California and that
Stanford was the roughest team in
the Southern division, basing its
claim on recently released statistics.
These figures show that Stanford
averaged 24 fouls per man for the 12
games played, that Southern Califor- ■
nia was second with 2o per man, Cal
ifornia third with 22 : ;4, and U.C.L.A.
fcurth with 15.
In the first place, a diffei'ence of
one and one-quarter fouls per man
over a .schedule of 12 games isn't a
big margin. The editorial in the Cali
fomian was aimed at U.S.C., but
there was only a difference of one
fourth of a foul per man between
the Bears end the Trojans.
While this difference is very small,
the biggest thing to remember in
comparing the numbers of rules in
fractions of the conference teams is
that figures don't reveal the type of
foul called and that there are fouls
and fouls. California with a big team
has gained the reputation of playing

a rough, smashing, knockdown game :
with the result diat figures would
probably show more penalties called i
on the Bears for fouls of rough
bodily contact than on other teams, j
II must be remembered that offi- j
dating in different games varies. j
Many officials will call the first few
fouls on a team which plays a smash- j
ing game but if the players persist j
in their tactics, the referees will |
overlook many of the fouls for fear
of slowing up the game too much.
Also fouls of that sort look just the
same in the statistics as do ones for
minor rules infractions. Regardless
of the statistics, which show very
little difference anyway, California
has gained the reputation of being
one of the roughest teams on the
Coast, largely due to the type of
game they play.
Yesterdav this column, in stating
that "Dink" Templeton sent ....
Mottram and Dunn south," gave the
impression that the B.A.C. footed the
bill for the trackmen's participation
in the Long Beach relays Saturday.
This is not the case, as both men
paid their own expenses for the trip,
including their entrance fees.
No matter who paid for the trip,
their performances, each capturing
a first place, gives a fair indication
of the of the
Indian track squad. With several
more men of the same calibre who

were unable to participate in the
Long Beach meet, Stanford track
sters should be able to roll up a re
spectable total of points in the
IC4A's if they are given the chance
to compete. —Tremaine
