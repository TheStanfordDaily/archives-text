™ squad this afternoon when Captain Dohbie, Tommy Roxburgh, and Bob
Norminton of the British Columbia "Rep" team return to the Farm. The

played here last Thursday, and believe that a little polishing will make it
a craekerjack rugger side.
Roxburgh, who captains the B.C. team and holds down first five, will
lake charge of the backJield men. Norminton, the man whose well-placed

> penalty kick provided the Canadian
' win against Stanford, will handle the
forwards, and the B.C. coach, Cap-
I tain Dobbie. will overlook the team
as a whole.
The visitors have yet two games
on their schedule, and will play San
Francisco University on the Dons'
field Thursday afternoon, and a uni
ted club team at Seal.i' Stadium next

Stanford f-nd California in a pair of
fast games.
Stanford hopes to arrange a game
with either U.C.L.A. or Southern
California to be played during the
spring vacation, and are at present
awaiting the outcome of the southern
universities' game in Los Angeles j
this Saturday. If played, the meet- |
ing would decide the collegiate ;
championship of California, as Stan
ford has o i ready won from S.F.U.
