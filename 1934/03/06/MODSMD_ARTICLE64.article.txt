# Lecturer to Discuss Law
## Kirkwood Sixth Vocational Guidance Speaker 
### 
Stanford's School of Law will be
discussed and explained to lower
division students Wednesday eve
ning by Dean Marion R. Kirkwood,
Dean of the Law School, in the sixth
weekly lecture sponsored by the Vo
cational Guidance Committee of the
lower division in aiding underclass
men to choose their department ma
jor.
In a recent survey of 18,000 alumni
of the University it was shown that
11.6 per cent were in the law pro
fession, nearly twice the number in
any other single profession. This
fact, together with the reputation
that Stanford's Law School has
gained through the success of its
graduates, makes Wednesday's talk
one of the most valuable and inter
esting of the series.
C. Gilbert Wrenn, secretary of the
Vocational Guidance Committee,
urges all students who are interested
in any phase of pre-law or the Law
School proper to attend.
