## 
### 
Already famous for their mu
sic and boyish enthusiasm, fun
loving Phi Delt boys discovered
a new noiscmaker yesterday
noon.
Travelers on Lasucn first
noticed there was something
wrong at the house when they
saw the lads quietly standing 011
the front lawn. But the hush
was merely the calm before the
storm. When Richard Brodrick,
first cornet in the Phi Delt band,
stepped out of the house on the
way to a 1 o'clock class, all eyes
were fixed on Richard.
As Brodrick got in his car and
stepped 011 the starter there was
an explosion, and smoke poured
out from underneath the hood.
Though all the brothers agreed
it was "good fun." Brodrick
drove off to class hastily, his car
undamaged by the firecracker.
