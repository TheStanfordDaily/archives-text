## PUBLIC OPINION 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Brother Malloch, you have played
into the hands of the enemy.#Your
tactics show a deplorable lack of
knowledge as to your letter's in
evitable result.
Till you wrote your first letter, no
one was particularly interested in
the Military Ball; your letters have
made it a success. Do not miscon
strue me; I disagree only with your
tactics, not your beliefs.
We pacifists will never accomplish
anything by criticizing R.O.T.C.'s,
American Legion commanders who
bleat for preparedness yet piously
wish for peace, etc.
There is one sure way that the final
goal may be obtained; let all pacifists
turn militarists. Lai us support
"preparedness," "defense day," "a
navy second to none,'' "ten thousand
airplanes"—and all the rest. We
know what the result will be. War
will come; with that war capitalism
begins its last few days; our goal is
then achieved. The sooner we bring
about that war, the sooner will we
reach the truly warless state.
At any rate, Mr. Malloch, I hope
to see you at the said Garbagemen's
Ball. Chairman Kendall, in all fair
ness to you for your inestimable aid,
can do not less than give you a com
plimentary bid. Sincerely,
W. Harrover
