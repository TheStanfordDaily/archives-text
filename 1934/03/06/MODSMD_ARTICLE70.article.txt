The Editor, Sir:
Why Mr. Malloch, don't you know
that your statements relative to
Army men and the Military Ball are

] quite contrary to the entire experi
: ence of the human race, to the expe- 1
| rienee of 10,000 years before horrid
j capitalists were even invented, and
certainly contrary to the accepted
' standards of this country? Now,
1 Rolph (cute name that), it is indeed
j most fortunate for you that you live ,
! in a country well protected by a
| minimum of tanks and professional
i soldiers, in a country that tolerates
j the effervescence from such flabby
minds as yours. As you know, Rolph, i
in Russia, for instance, even to think
such thoughts so contrary to the es
tablished standard, much less fool
ishly state them in public, would
subject you to the liberal and broad
j minded ministrations of the O.G.
1 P.U. - Perforation by leaden pellets
or refrigeration in a Siberian ice cave
would be a mild reward for such >
contrary opinions as yours. In fact, J
Rolph, did it ever occur to you that j
possibly the professional soldier
might have in mind, among other ;
things, that he and the rest of the |
country should be prepared to resist
by force, if necessary, the greatest
1 gang on murderers and slaughterers !
' of innocent human beings in modern, (
or possibly all,-history, the bloody i
i exploitation and subjugation of the
Dumb Russian Proletariat by Lenin
1 and gang, and that these D.R.P. now
have one of the world's largest arm
ies, many times larger than ours, all
equipped with tanks and everything, j
and that they can hardly wait for
spring to start converting little Japan I
to the Red Banner?
;
I do hope, Rolph, that you are j
i not guilty of Communism, also that '

this country remains one of the few
places in the world where such con
trary utterances as yours can be
made public with no more serious
consequences than to cause con
temptuous amusement at the ex
pense of the utterer. Now, Rolph, if
you can get a date, better buy a
ticket to the Military Ball and have
a good time associating with some
real red-blooded men for a change.
