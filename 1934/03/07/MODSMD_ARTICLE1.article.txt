# "NO SMOKING" ON QUAD WILL BE OBSERVED
## Ex Committee Approves Tradition-Upholding Men's Group DR. JORDAN IS QUOTED Offices of Professors And Classrooms Affected 
### 
Observance of Stanford's oldest
tradition was asked last night when
the Ex Committee unanimously con
curred with the Quadrangle Club,
representative men's group, in voting
to preserve the unwritten law against
smoking on the Quad.
Classrooms, instructors' offices,
and arched walks will be included
in the fresh interpretation of a cus
tom begun by Stanford's original
student body in the first week after
the University began.
Motive Emphasized
Slackening of observance in recent
years was cited in the club's letter to
the Ex Committee, pointing out that
the primary motive for the custom
was reverence for the Quad, sym
bolical of the institution. An official
resolution followed reading of the
letter and discussion.
The resolution by the committee
"severely condemns the recent vio
lations of the tradition of no smoking
on the Quad or in any academic
building."
Law Set in 1891
It also recommended the strict ob
servance of the unwritten law which
has kept the Quad free of ashes and
cigarette stubs .since 1891.
The Quadrangle Club's letter men
tioned "much favorable comment"
by visitors about the tradition, and
quoted from Dr. David Starr Jor
dan's "Days of a Man" which told of
the establishment of the resolution
by the first student body.
