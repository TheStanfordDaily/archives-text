# Film Depicts Serf Revolt
## 
### 
The .story of a Mongolian hunter, j
mistaken for the son of Genghis j
Kahn, and of the revolt of peasants!
against their Russian lords is told in ;
' Storm Over Asia," tonight's movie |
presented by the English Club.
Photography and acting are said I
to be exceptional, rivaling even fa- I
mous silent pictures such as "The j
Four Horsemen."
The Stanford of several years ago I
will also be revived when "Stanford i
D;iys" appears as the second half of j
the double-bill program. Made in j
1924, the film features Lloyd Nolan, j
then a noted campus actor, and is
professional in production.
Action of those days is clothed in i
the now archaic 1924 slang, and por- j
trays the "dinky" trolley and many \
other landmarks now extinct.
The double program will take i
place in the Assembly Hail at 7:30 â– 
instead of 8 o'clock as previously j
announced. Admission will be 251
ccnts.
