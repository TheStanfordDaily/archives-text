# 'BACK TO FARM' DANCE CLAMOR BRINGS RESULT
## Demands for Popular Dance Met By Rallymen With Saturday Plans 
### 
Demand for an all-campus, six-bit
dance Saturday night will be; met.
In the Women's Gym from 9 until
12 o'clock under the Rally Commit
tee's guidance, Stanford will dance
to the music of A1 Rushton's 10-
piece Royal Cardinal orchestra.
Clamor for a continuance of inex
pensive campus dances begun with
the "Back to the Farm" movement
last fall was loud last week, and
Rally Committeemen yesterday com
pleted plans to satisfy Stanford
dancers.
Waltman Heads Group
Bill Waltman heads the commit
tee arranging the dance, and prom
ises unique lighting effects and a
colored drop curtain to form a back
ground for Rushton's music and trio
refrains.
"Many people have asked why the
Rally Committee couldn't put on an
other 75-cent dance this quarter,"
Chairman Stan Beaubaire said yes
terday, "and we intend to give this
as the last dance of the quarter, es
pecially since there is no other event
scheduled for the campus that night
and many students would otherwise
go to the city for entertainment."
Others May Follow
The dance Saturday night will also
be of an experimental nature, Beau
baire said, since if the response is
good others will follow next quarter.
Assisting Waltman in arranging
the dance are B Kellogg, Jimmy
Triolo, Thornton Hinman, A1 Snyder,
Shelley Smith, Julius Jacobs, and
Eleanor Carlton.
