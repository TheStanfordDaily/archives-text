# Series Manager, Artists Score Pavilion 'Theatre'
## 
### ANNALEE WHITMORE 
Stanford needs a theatre, agrees
Concert Series Manager Prentice
Messimer. Visiting artists concur.
Mischa Elman in particular scored
Ihe antiquated pavilion, hastily re
modeled for concert use. He re
frained from commenting on Ihe
rickety wooden platform which
served as stage; he politely omitted
all reference to the patched burlap
curtain draped above his headâ€”for
publication. But ho did remark
quizzically to his interviewer that
"Your auditorium, it is not so deco
rative as it might be." *
So urgent is the demand for a new
structure, says Messimer, that "I
think it would be a fine thing if part
of our profits went toward a new
building. It would be worth it in thr
end.
"This year wo succeeded in selling
out two-thirds of the seating capa
city of the pavilion, 2.(>0(). and. that
with difficulty, I feel confident that

with a new theatre we could sell ut I
least 900 more."
Walter Gieseking, who appeared so
successfully last month, chivalrously
admired Stanford ingenuity in utiliz
ing such a totally unsuitable build
ing for the series.
The major share of complaints,
however, comes from the audience. 1
They object principally to Ihe defi
nitely uncomfortable seats. Next in
line comes poor visibility, owing j
'partly to the four large posts which (
obstruct a view of the would-be
stage. Scats are altogether too close
together. Acoustics, while not per
feet, arc considered tolerable.
Expense of moving in the portable i
chairs and erecting a platform for i
each concert, besides the anaesthetic
drops and blinding spotlights, while
not appreciable, will be saved if and |
when the series cafi move from the
pavilion to a structure suited to its
needs.
