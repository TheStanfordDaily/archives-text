# This Tradition Should Last
## 
### 
I)r. David Starr Jordan, the man whoso activity was
instrumental in the founding of Stanford and whose spirit
si ill lives, wrote this passage in his book, Days of a Man:
lie fore the first week had passed, the "Student
llodg," already organized, passed a resolution that
there should be no smoking in the Quadrangle (for
which we alt felt a kind of reverence) nor in ang of
the academic buildings. The tradition then established
has ever since been respected by both students and
faculty.
Members of the Executive Committee last night unani
mously endorsed a suggestion made by Quadrangle Club
that tin's worthy tradition be revived. That it has fallen
into decline is no fault of the students as persons; they
have not been informed that such things exist.
The fact is that no smoking is wanted —by students or
professors — inside of the Outer Quadrangle, which in
cludes not only classrooms, but sidewalks surrounding the
Quad as well. This means that smokers should not putt'
(heir weeds while leaning on a stone column which forms
part of one of the arcades. Nor should they, technically,
even stand on the steps. Of course, the Inner Quadrangle
is as sacred in this respect as any other parts of that group.
Students and faculty members alike have the chance to
put this practice into effect at once. Final examinations
will be here within a few days, and no belter time is avail
able to give affected parties a chance to make amends than
I lien.
Ignorance is bliss. Blissful smoking is fine—in a canoe
floating about Lagunita, but not in or ou the Quad.
