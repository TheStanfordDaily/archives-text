Dr. Hav Lyman Wilbur, shoving aside his endless siring
of administrative duties, >vent to bat for some MIS needy
Stanford men and women with the result that immediate
employment at 10 cents an hour lias been provided for
llial number during the month of March. Upon his appli
cation the Stale Emergency Relief Administration is leav
ing -Y 1,770 on the Farm to be used in creation of employ
ment this month with a maximum of per individual.
Two or three salient points are nice to hear about. In
Ihe lirst place, the employment is immediate. Next, we find
dial the Slate of California has seen fit to allow Stanford,
a private institution, to partake of the Slate funds. We
.â€¢ire glad to hear lliml California has finally decided that
the Farm is no "rich man's place" and that Stanford has
as many if not more needy students per hundred than the
average public institution. We are glad that these stu
dents are to receive another helping hand at a lime when
if is most welcome.
