# We Wait for Saturday
## 
### 
We dnnee Saturday night, at six bits a throw; a fitting
celebration to follow the benefit all-l'nivcrsity track meet
of the afternoon.
Now that finals hover with ;i hint of impending doom
over the campus horizon, it's just about time to take a few
moments off and enjoy ;i Saturday night on the Farm with
local friends.
Slick around Saturday all day and you won't regret
it. Furthermore, you'll save the two or three stone that
would have perchance been dropped somewhere else in
!lie Hay region.
