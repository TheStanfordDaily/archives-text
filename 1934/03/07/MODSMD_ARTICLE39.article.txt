# WHY IT'S NEWS
## LESS WORK, MORE PAY 
### CROMPTON HANGS, Jr 
Following up F.R.'s great speech
to the NRA leaders Monday, Gen
eral Johnson has trotted out a new
scheme to increase employment. It
is no secret that the slowly increas
ing number of unemployed has the
Administration worried. Lust week,
the President proposed a re-vamped
CWA to carry on lor another year,
lake care of about four million peo
ple. But that isn't enough; factories
must employ more men. Until they
do, prosperity will be delayed.
The Plan
But business isn't good enough for
industry to employ as many as it
did in 1929. So General Johnson's
plan is to have working hours re
duced TO per cent each week, have
wages increased 10 per cent at the
same time. The result would be
that what work there is would be
spread mit; two million more would
then be employed, reducing the job
less to live or six million.
t Can It Work?
There is a catch to this scheme,
though. Someone will have to pay
for the wage increase. It will prob
ably be the consumer. Many people
would like to see it taken out of the
profits of industry; this is unlikely.
So far the NRA has made it very
easy to increase prices. As this is
the easiest way of raising wages and
giving in to the Government, it will
probably be done. So if the John
son plan goes through, prices of
many things will be upped about 10
per cent. Housewives, etc., may
howl, but apparently prices will
have to go up if wages do.
Will It Last?
If this plan really keeps two mil
lion more men employed, it will be
worth all it cost and more. But if it
fails, or works poorly, there will be
trouble, because if hours are again
reduced and wages upped, prices will
rise some more, and people may re
fuse to buy as much. If they do,
prices will have to stay put and
profits will sink. If profits sink, the
U.S. will get less money in taxes. So
any way you look at it, it looks bad.
The chances for the success of
such a move as proposed by the NRA
Administrator are about even. Re
member, he said last summer that
the 40-hour week would end unem
ployment; a 36-hour week has al
ready become necessary; yesterday
Congress proposed a 30-hour week.
With increased confidence on the
part of most everybody and with the
available work spread out, F.R.
might turn the trick and get rid of
unemployment.
II this plan does not work, we may
have a 25-hour week. Roosevelt be
lieves in experimenting. According
to the law of averages, he should be
successful soon. This plan may be
the lucky number.

t Can It Work?
There is a catch to this scheme,
though. Someone will have to pay
for the wage increase. It will prob
ably be the consumer. Many people
would like to see it taken out of the
profits of industry; this is unlikely.
So far the NRA has made it very
easy to increase prices. As this is
the easiest way of raising wages and
giving in to the Government, it will
probably be done. So if the John
son plan goes through, prices of
many things will be upped about 10
per cent. Housewives, etc., may
howl, but apparently prices will
have to go up if wages do.
Will It Last?
If this plan really keeps two mil
lion more men employed, it will be
worth all it cost and more. But if it
fails, or works poorly, there will be
trouble, because if hours are again
reduced and wages upped, prices will
rise some more, and people may re
fuse to buy as much. If they do,
prices will have to stay put and
profits will sink. If profits sink, the
U.S. will get less money in taxes. So
any way you look at it, it looks bad.
The chances for the success of
such a move as proposed by the NRA
Administrator are about even. Re
member, he said last summer that
the 40-hour week would end unem
ployment; a 36-hour week has al
ready become necessary; yesterday
Congress proposed a 30-hour week.
With increased confidence on the
part of most everybody and with the
available work spread out, F.R.
might turn the trick and get rid of
unemployment.
II this plan does not work, we may
have a 25-hour week. Roosevelt be
lieves in experimenting. According
to the law of averages, he should be
successful soon. This plan may be
the lucky number.
Following up F.R.'s great speech
to the NRA leaders Monday, Gen
eral Johnson has trotted out a new
scheme to increase employment. It
is no secret that the slowly increas
ing number of unemployed has the
Administration worried. Lust week,
the President proposed a re-vamped
CWA to carry on lor another year,
lake care of about four million peo
ple. But that isn't enough; factories
must employ more men. Until they
do, prosperity will be delayed.
The Plan
But business isn't good enough for
industry to employ as many as it
did in 1929. So General Johnson's
plan is to have working hours re
duced TO per cent each week, have
wages increased 10 per cent at the
same time. The result would be
that what work there is would be
spread mit; two million more would
then be employed, reducing the job
less to live or six million.
