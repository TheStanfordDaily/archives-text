# Army Fight Continues in Forum Talk
## Militarists Marshal Forces To Repeal Pacifists' Attack Tomorrow 
### Hal von Breton 
The case of Malloch vs. the United
States R.O.T.C. will be heard before
the Public Forum in Room 214 at
7:15 o'clock tomorrow evening.
Public demand, that old bogey, is
responsible for the transfer of the
greatest Campus Opinion battle in
years to the sound and fury of the
Public Forum's rostrum. The issue
sprang from the brain of Rolph Mal
loch, militant pacifist, who weeks
ago wrote the celebrated Campus
Opinion whose echoes still fill Daily
columns.
R.O.T.C. Peace Menace?
Of right, then, Malloch will pro
pose the resolution: "This house con
demns the R.O.T.C. as an instrument
of militarism and a menace to peace."
Opposed to him will be Lieutenant
Will Rogers of the local unit, debater
and polo player.
Confident in Rogers' ability to
stand firm against Malloch's doc
trines, Public Forum heads still re
gret that, bound by their rules, they
were unable to obtain Legion Com
mander Hayes, who recently pre
sented the FID AC award + o Stanford,
or Palo Alto Legionnaires to furnish
a more perverse opposition.
Audience May Speak
Rogers will, however, be supported
by the local lieutenantry, Scabbard
and Blade men, and any campus
citizens who care to attend and
.speak.
In the chair will be Abe Mellin
koff, ex-editor. Questions from the
floor must be, he insists, to the point
and specific. No speakers may talk
from the floor until after Rogers and
Malloch have concluded 10-minute
speeches, when, as usual, five-min
ute extemporaneous talkers will be
recognized by the chair.
