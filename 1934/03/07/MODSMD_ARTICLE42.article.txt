# THE 						REVIEWER
## "BRAZILIAN ADVENTURE," 
### Peter Fleming 
(Charles Scribner's Sons, 10)54, New
York)
Here is a non-fiction best seller of
genuine merit, a highly amusing ac
count of a recent expedition into the |
Brazilian jungle. The purpose of the j
expedition was to determine the fate j
of an English exploring party which
disappeared while searching for the
City of Gold in 1925.
The whole affair was one grand,
ridiculous failure—from the day the i
ill-advised searchers left London,
armed against the natives with tear
gas bombs and varnished arrows, to
the thrilling but meaningless thou
sand-mile race down the Araguaya
River to Para.
Fleming, twenty-six-year-old dra
matic critic on the London "Spec- 1
tator," and Oxford graduate, does not |
attempt to make of the expedition j
anything but a comic opera fiasco. J
To him it was just one big blunder

after another, and he has a huge
time telling about it. He gives no
stuffy, melodramatic accounts of the
"Dangers of the Great Unchartered
Reaches of Central Brazil!" He
frankly admits that here were no
colorful climaxes to detract from the
complete failure which characteri
zed every move of the expedition.
Since he makes no attempt to star
tle, his descriptions of conditions
and customs have an authentic ring.
These word pictures of a little
known part of the world are very
interesting and informative.
The main source of charm in this
exceedingly charming book lies in
the stylistic excellence maintained,
unforced, throughout. It is a vigor
ous, refreshing style, well flavored
with a delightful, spontaneous good
humor. —Slattery
