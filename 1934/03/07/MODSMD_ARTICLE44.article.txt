# KENDALL VS. WALKER
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
"People who live in glass houses j
shouldn't." And Mr. Kendall vie- j
iously attacks Mr. Walker for throw- i
ing stones by hurling boulders. The ;
militarist calls Mr. Walker's argu
ments "hair-brained and wholly un- j
founded," which may be expected i
from pacifists." This form of argu-*j
ment in itself exhibits a rather mil- ■
dewed intellect. Only a narrow- i
minded individual would make such j
a generalization including all paci- I
fists.
It is not my object to defend or j
criticize Mr. Walker's letter. It is j
my object to point out that Mr. Ken- I
dall has "let off" more steam and I
more ridiculous statements than his j
adversary. Who cares how old or I
how wheezy the tank is? But one
should be careful when he confuses
weak - mindedness and cowardice
with a little common sense. The fa
vorite argument for cornered mili
tarists is to accuse the pacifists of
cowardice without even attempting
to weigh the pacifist's reasons. Any !
idiot jump off a cliff, and he will
do more good than attempting to I
promote a feeling in favor of offen
sive war. Let him jump, but not be \
ired because others do not care to
follow. Why must people attempt to I
vindicate their emotions, not their
logic, by pouring vitriol in one an- i

' other's ears, and offer abuse for
proof. —Robert St. Denis
