The Editor, Si:"
Whether or not Stanford sends
j back an experienced and highly tal
j ented track team to the IC4A's de
■ ponds largely on the Student Body.
• Patronize the all-University meet
i this Saturday and a movement will
be definitely launched; spend your
; quarters on trash and Stanford not
| only will lose a golden opportunity
! to win the IC4A's but also will for
feit her chance to regain the inter
sectional standing she over-anx
i iously fumbled away against Colum
bia. Last year, Stanford would have
i won the intercollegiate had it not
been for devastating injuries. This
j year, the cause of defeat must not
I be lack of Student Body support.

The team, if it goes back, is not
taking a joy-ride at our expense. On
the contrary, it is going back with a
set purpose—to clean up the Inter
collegiutes at the expense of U.S.C.
and the East. These 11 men: Captain
Gus Meier, John Lyman, Gordon
Dunn, A1 Blackman, John Mot tram,
Bud Deacon, Sam Klopstock, Carl
ton Thorns, Chuck Nimmo, Phil Wil
liams, and Paul Zaches could garner
45 points on past performances. Last
year, U.S.C. won with 45, but cannot
hope to repeat this year because of
graduation. As for the East—she al
ways takes care of herself. Oppor
tunity knocks but once. Let's give
our best support to an even better
cause. —Harold Smith
