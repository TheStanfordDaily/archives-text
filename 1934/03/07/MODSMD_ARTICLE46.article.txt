# HABLES WILL MAKE COMEBACK TRY IN SPRINTS SATURDAY
## 
### Jack Drown 
Will Les H.ibles, former Stanford
sprint star, make good in his come
back attempt? This question will be
decided Saturday afternoon on An
gell Field in the all-University track
meet sponsored by Skull and Snakes,
men's honorary society, when the
dynamic Stanford Student Manager
matches strides with Carl Thorns,
sensational sophomore .short sprint
star, over the 100- and 220-yard
courses.
Hables, who pushed Frank Wykoff
to his present world's record of 9.4
seconds in the 100-yard dash two
years ago in the S.A.A.U. meet, has
been working out for the past week
in preparation for Saturday's en
counter and is already in excellent
shape as was evidenced by his 9.8
performance in the century dash at
Kezar Stadium Sunday in the Olym
pic Club vs. San Francisco Univer
sity meet.
Thoms Competes
Thorns, who is running his first
year for Stanford, boasts of a mark
of 9.(3 seconds for the 100-yard sprint
set at Santa Barbara last year while
attending Ventura Junior College,
so the race appears to be a "natural."
Another great duel slated for Sat
urday is that between Chuck Nimmo
and Norm Bright, two of the best
milers to attend this institution since
it was founded. Nimmo turned in his
fastest performance while captaining
the frosh trackmen against California
last year, when he was timed in
â– 4:23.5 for the four-lap race.
Bright, who hails from Bellingham,
Washington, and who has been in
eligible to compete for Stanford due
to the transfer ruling, has been
clocked in the very fast time of 4:20,
and the contest Saturday may result
in a new Coast record for the dis
tance.
Watcrbury Invited
An attempt is being made to get
Ed Waterbury, great javelin thrower
at California last year, to compete
and should he accept, Saturday's
fans will witness some hefty spear
throwing as both Waterbury and
Mottram, Stanford's star, are capa
ble of distances beyond 210 feet.
Twenty-five cent student tickets
for Saturday's track and field gigan
tic remain on sale at the A.S.S.U.
office only until Friday, all ducats
being 55 cents, the regular general
admission price, at the gate Saturday.
