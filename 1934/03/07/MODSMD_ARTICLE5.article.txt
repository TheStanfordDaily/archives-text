# Allen Tells Of Program
## 
### 
The background of the selections
to be sung at the Founders' Day
service in the Memorial Church Fri
day, as well as of the service itself,
was the subject of Warren D. Al
len's talk in the Assembly Hall last
night.
Beethoven's Missa Solemnis in D
Major, which is to be the second part
of the program, took up the major
part of Allen's talk. "In this work
the composer gave a great religious
message to all mankind," he said.
Other numbers discussed were
those from the Bach B Minor Mass,
which are being repeated from last
year's program.
The San Francisco Municipal Cho
rus of 250 will sing these numbers at
the Founders' Day service, which is
the one day set aside out of the year
by the Stanford family to commemo
rate the birth of Senator Stanford.
A few tickets remain for students
who wish to attend the exercises, and
can be obtained by presenting stu
dent body cards in the lobby of the
Administration Building today. To
morrow all remaining tickets will go
to alumni.
