# SOUTHERN PAPERS JUMPED ON DUNN
## 
### 
After winning the shotput last Sat
urday at the Long Beach relays,
Dunn fouled on his first three throws
in the discus, thus failing to qualify.
Los Angeles papers, having heard
much of the Slinger's prowess, were

quick to take the news up and head ;
lines proclaimed that "Dunn Fails to J
Qualify."
Two more good races will come in
| the hurdles where Captain Gus
Meier will be pushed by Sopho
! mores Klopstock and Kingsbury, if
. the latter is in shape, and Freshman |
I Evaas. With four hurdles capable of '
' holding their own in any company,
i Stanford begins to look like the
U.S.C. teams of several years ago |
, when they swept the timber events
in most of their dual meets. Last j
year Meier and Herbert regained
i some of the hurdling prestige gained j
for Stanford by such men as Podge
Smith, and this year it looks as j
, though it may be the Indians who
will be sweeping the hurdles.
