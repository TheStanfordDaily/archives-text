i season,
I Not for these many years has a I
| team the strength of the present var- j
sity represented Stanford on tHe dia
j mond. A combination not unlike that |
which gave the Indians a great foot- !
1 ball team this past fall has reap- j
peared on the baseball field. Tal- !
ented sophomores plus a redoubtable |
nucleus of letter-men have been
skillfully blended by Coach Harry !
: Wolter to f>roduce a team that has a '
| belter than even chance of dethron- j
I ing California, last year's Conference
j champions.
Easy U.C. Prey
| The Gaels of St. Mary's fell easy '
j prey to the strong Golden Bear |
i base bailers Saturday in the opening,
' game of the Conference by a 13 to 1 i
! score, and therefore should offer no ;
; serious opposition to the Stanford!
j nine. However, the fact that the j
- &ame will be played at Moraga may
j have some bearing on the outcome !
I because of the none too smooth in- j
j field and rather sadly neglected outer i
j garden in the foothills back of Oak- i
I land.
| Coach Wolter has not as yet an- j
I nouneed a starting line-up but it is !
more than likely that Stan Ander- J
i son will take the mound with Fred
' Heringer being held in reserve for I
: the return engagement against St.
' Mary's here Saturday.
Gaels Weakened
The Gaels, who shared the cellar
position with USC in last year's Con- j
| ference race, have been weakened |
! considerably by graduation and in- j
; eligibility. Either Stetson or diminu
i tive "Mickey" McKay will open at i
; pitcher.
Following Saturday's encounter j
Stanford will forsake the diamond
! until the spring vacation when the j
team journeys south to oppose USC
1 in three games.

i season,
I Not for these many years has a I
| team the strength of the present var- j
sity represented Stanford on tHe dia
j mond. A combination not unlike that |
which gave the Indians a great foot- !
1 ball team this past fall has reap- j
peared on the baseball field. Tal- !
ented sophomores plus a redoubtable |
nucleus of letter-men have been
skillfully blended by Coach Harry !
: Wolter to f>roduce a team that has a '
| belter than even chance of dethron- j
I ing California, last year's Conference
j champions.
Easy U.C. Prey
| The Gaels of St. Mary's fell easy '
j prey to the strong Golden Bear |
i base bailers Saturday in the opening,
' game of the Conference by a 13 to 1 i
! score, and therefore should offer no ;
; serious opposition to the Stanford!
j nine. However, the fact that the j
- &ame will be played at Moraga may
j have some bearing on the outcome !
I because of the none too smooth in- j
j field and rather sadly neglected outer i
j garden in the foothills back of Oak- i
I land.
| Coach Wolter has not as yet an- j
I nouneed a starting line-up but it is !
more than likely that Stan Ander- J
i son will take the mound with Fred
' Heringer being held in reserve for I
: the return engagement against St.
' Mary's here Saturday.
Gaels Weakened
The Gaels, who shared the cellar
position with USC in last year's Con- j
| ference race, have been weakened |
! considerably by graduation and in- j
; eligibility. Either Stetson or diminu
i tive "Mickey" McKay will open at i
; pitcher.
Following Saturday's encounter j
Stanford will forsake the diamond
! until the spring vacation when the j
team journeys south to oppose USC
1 in three games.
