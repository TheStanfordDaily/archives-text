# Law School Ranked as One of America's Best

### JOHN M'CLELLAND 
Authentic and striking evidence!
strengthening the reputation of ex
cellence that Stanford's Law School
has gained is set forth in an unusual
report of the California survey com
l mittec of law schools of California in
which the detailed facts of an inves- |
! tigation of every law school of the :
' state are laid bare.
The report, compiled last summer
! hut not placed before the public,
contains a complete and impartial
analysis of the merits and defects of j
the 20 colleges of law in the state.
Describing Stanford's legal depart
| mont as "a school that ranks as one |
of the best of America's full-time
law schools," the compilers of the
i report give the warmest praise to
Stanford in the whole of their 145-
page discourse.
"California has a ratio of one law
yer to every 562 persons," says the
report, "and since three-fourths of
the graduates admitted to the state
| bar are from the four top ranking

institutions, it seems apparent thai
the other 1(5 schools have little ex
case for existing.''
In the complete description of the
financial structure, administration
and organization, physical equip
ment, library, and faculty of each of
the state's law schools there are
brought to light the incomplete and
slipshod ways in which many of
California's horde of lawyers arc
trained.
Law Dean Marion Kirkwood has
expressed himself as well satisfied
with the report and believes that it is
a slop toward improving the class of
legal education given in California.
The Board of Governors of the
State Bar of California was the or
ganization responsible for the report.
It was compiled by Will Shafroth,
one of America's leaders in the field
of law and prominent in national and
foreign affairs, and 11. C. Horack,
who with Dean Kirkwood, helped
establish the college of law at Duke
University.
