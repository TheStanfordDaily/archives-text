# Author of Anatol Views World Without Illusion
## 
### 
Although Vienna has undergone
great changes in the forty or so
years which have intervened since
Arthur Schnitzler wrote the series
of witty sketches called "Anatol,"
the traditional flavor of the city lin
gers on in them.
Brittle, delicate, this series of dia
logues has about it at once the air of
the Viennese waltz and that of the
gentleman without illusion.
Anatol himself is the embodiment
of that sentimentality which refuses
stubbornly to admit disillusion. The
author, through the character of
Max, views the world with clear
seeing eyes, comments wryly upon
the antics of Anatol, and still retains
a sympathy with the idle young boy
which all of his worldly experience
cannot destroy.
Masquers, women's honorary dra
matic organization, which is spon
soring a reading of this play on
Thursday evening, has attempted an
extremely difficult task. The sketches
demand an extreme lightness of

touch and the most careful high
comedy playing, of the .subtleties of •
the script are to be appreciated.
The play has been acted by a
number of fine players, although j
productions are infrequent. John j
Barrymore introduced it to New j
York in 1912, with Oswald Yorke as
the Max and Doris Keane the Mimi. j
Four years ago New York saw the ;
second production, with Joseph |
Schildkraut in the leading role, and
Walter Connolly and Miriam Hop
kins among the support.
In tomorrow's reading Robert i
Brauns will handle the title role,
and seven members of Masquers the j
parts of the women who give Anatol
unromantic jolts but are unable to
break his illusions. They are Jean
Albertson, Mary Ann Crary, Har
riette Hall, Eleanor Harris, Virginia
Marvin, Shelley Smith, and Katrina
Wallingford.
Direction is in the hands of Ma
rian Jones, and Elizabeth Chapin
will read the necessary stage direc- !
tions.
