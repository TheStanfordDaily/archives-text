# Frosh Track Men Meet Alameda County Schools
## 
### 
With the collective all-stars of the
Alameda County prep league sched
uled for opposition next Saturday
morning, Coach Bill Ellington's frosh
track men are making the most of
the ideal training weather this week.
Running a hard first 220 and then
coming in with what was left, Chuck
Voigt, Babe quarter-miler and sprin
ter, stepped off a 0:50.6 440 yesterday,
with Greene, also of the frosh, but a
couple of strides behind.
While preps are more than prone
to upset the dope and come through
with winning performances, the
combined forces of Berkeley, Ala
meda, Piedmont, and Richmond High
Schools will probably not come close
to copping Saturday's meet. They
arc sure to garner points in the pole
vault and broad jump, however,
where the frosh are particularly
weak.
