# Quad Salesmen Make Row Canvass Tonight
## 
### 
In search of yearbook orders, Quad
| business men will make a general
canvass tonight to collect blanks
distributed on the Row Monday.
The campaign was started in an |
effort to make up for the decrease I
of Row sales which were 14 per cent J
behind the Hall.
Collection of the orders is to be !
carried on at an hour late enough to j
enable the fraternity pledges to in
clude their orders and thus swell the ,
fraternity total.
