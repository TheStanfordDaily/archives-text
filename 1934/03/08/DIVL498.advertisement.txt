ONE STRONG SYSTEM
Welded together by common policies and ideals,
tfie 27 Bell System companies work as one.
Operation is in the hands of 24 associated tele-'
phone companies â€” each attuned to the area it
serves. Scientific research and manufacture of appara
tus are delegated to Bell Telephone Laboratories and
Western Electric. Co-ordination of all System ac
tivities is a function of the American Telephone
and Telegraph Company.
Thanks to the skilful teamwork of these many
Bell System units, you can talk to almost anyone,
anywhere, anytime!
