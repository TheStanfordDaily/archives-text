# STANFORD NINE PLAYS GAELS IN LEAGUE OPENER
## Dick Miles Moved to Center Field With Moscrip Out; Nutting in Right ANDERSON WILL PITCH Wolter's Men Confident Of Win Over Moragans 
### Chuck Clancy 
Radiating an optimistic mien and
well primed for a successful Confer
ence season, the varsity baseball
squad will climb aboard a bus bound
for Moraga today at noon where the
Cards face the Gaels of St, Mary's in
the 1934 league opener.
Coach Harry Wolter announced
last night, that with the sole excep
tion of Jim Moscrip, his charges
were in top form for ,the impending
race. Moscrip, who was slated to
open at the centerfield position, in
jured his leg in an intramural bas
ketball game a few nights ago and
will be unable to participate.
Miles to Center
Wolter will shift Captain Dick
Miles from his regular spot in right
field to center and will start Mort
Nutting. This combination will fill
the gap left by Moscrip without
weakening to any preceptible degree
the strength of the team.
The Card pitching ace, Stan An
derson, has been selected to usher
in the season on the mound today. It
is expected that Anderson will have
little trouble setting down the Gaels
who boast no special potency at the
plate.
Infield Starts Intact
The infield that has been working
most of the practice games will take
tin field intact. Frank Tremaine,
who ranks with Bob Hamilton as the
best base runner on the squad, will
start at third base. Hard hitting Ray
Forsythe will play short," and Jim
Woolley is slated to patrol the sec
end base area.
Art Hearn, who has been hitting
the ball hard and consistently 'in
this spring's warm-up games, gets
the call over Bob Grayson at the first
base spot.
Hamilton, starting in left field,
rounds out the Stanford line-up.
Following today's game the St.
Mary's team wili journey to the
Farm Saturday for the second game
against the Cards.
