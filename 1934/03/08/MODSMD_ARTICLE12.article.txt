This radiophoto of Leopold 111, new King of the Belgians, sliows the ruler as he left his castle in suburban
Lackcn to ride to Brussels to be enthroned at a joint session of Parliament. In the uniform of a lieutenant
general and mounted on a brown horse, he was cheered by thousands who, the day before, had lined the same
streets to pay homage to his father, the late King Albert. \
