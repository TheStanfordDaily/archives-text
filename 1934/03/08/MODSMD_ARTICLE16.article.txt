## 
### ANNALEE WHITMORE 
Charges that Assembly Hull facili- ;
ties do not meet needs of the dra- :
matic department were substantiated
last night by campus thespians. Con
clusion: "Stanford needs a new thea
tre!"
Jean Albertson, prominent in j
"Arms and the Man" and recent
readings, considers the hall no fit
place for dramatic productions.
"I do think that it is poorly built,
and has no acoustics to .speak of;,
what, there arc of them are pretty]
bad," she asserts. "Besides, the
higher platform makes it difficult to 1
establish an empalhy."
Jimmy Sandoe possesses an en
viable reputation as star of innu
merable opuses and director of note.
He believes that the addition of a
new structure would greatly aid the
work of local thespians, since neither |

the Little Theatre nor Assembly Hall
is entirely adequate.
Mary Ann Wheeler, who made her
official bow to Farm audiences in
"Distant Drums," says that dressing
rooms and storage spaces are "not
so good."
"We do need new dressing rooms,"
she declared. "Prop rooms aren't
modern enough or large enough, and
acoustics are terrible."
Jimmy Benet, romantic lead of the
same production, was not available
for inquiry. "He thinks we ought to
have a new theatre, though" agreed
a fraternity brother.
Mary Louise Dow hurled the part
ing shot. "I think that the seats are
well awful. People should be paid
to sit in them. Anyone who has
stayed through nn entire perform
ance realizes the situation perfectly."
