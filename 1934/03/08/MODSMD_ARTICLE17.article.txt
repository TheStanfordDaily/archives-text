## 
### 
Campus comment yesterday was
unanimously in favor of the Ex Com
mittee's recent move to uphold the
unwritten law against smoking on
QUad. Both students and faculty ex
pressed views that concurred with
those held by the members of the
Quadrangle Club.
John Lyman, president of this or
ganization, said in reference to the
resolution: "We wish to thank the
Ex Committee for their co-operation
in carrying through our suggestion.
We hope definitely to do away with
smoking on Quad, especially during
finals."
Mrs. David Starr Jordan declined
to make a statement. "There is noth
ing I can add to what Mr. Jordan
said in 'Days of a Man,'" she said.
Professor Ernest Whitney Martin,
of the School of Letters, stated that
it is only in the last three or four
years that he has ever seen any
smoking on the Quad. Up to that
time it was never done.
"The last couple of years I've got
ten into the habit of smoking in my
office myself, so many people come
in with cigaretles in their mouths.
However, last fall 1 realized that I
was violating tradition and have not
smoked on the Quad since. I be
lieve, absolutely, in upholding tha
unwritten law."
