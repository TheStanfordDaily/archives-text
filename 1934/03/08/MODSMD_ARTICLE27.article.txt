# Ichihashi Says War Not Likely in Russia, Japan
## 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
Despite all the talk of impending
hostilities, Professor Yamato Ichi
hashi of the Stanford History De
partment does not think war at all
likely, or even probable, in the Far
Professor Ichihashi's efforts in
promoting good-will in the Orient
largely contributed toward Stan
lord's winning the FIDAC award.
"I believe," he said, "that neither
Japan or Russia will fight, first be
cause neither nation would gain
anything by such a struggle, and
second, because the atmosphere in
the Far East is happily becoming
clarified."
Commenting on the coronation of
Henry Pu-Yi on March 1, as em
peror of the new state of Manehu

Tikou (last week Manchukuo, and
until 1932 Manchuria) the professor
reiterated his belief of the pacific
future ahead of this "world's newest
nation." The emperor is 28 years
old and has been proclaimed em
peror twice before--in 1908 and 1917
â€”and is the last of the Manehu line
which has ruled China since 1644.
Japan finds herself in a peculiar
position, Ichihashi avers. She is sur
rounded on all sides by other nation
alities, and every move thai she
makes is likely to be interpreted as
aggressive.
She has no desire to break up this
ling, the professor concluded, but
neither will she assume a secondary
role and truckle to any foreign
power.
