Tonight's fun-loving Forum fea
turing Malloch vs. Rogers, campus
pacificism against the military ele
ment, will meet in Room 320, Geol
ogy corner, at 7:15 o'clock.
The resolution: "This house con
demns R.O.T.C. as an instrument of
militarism and a provocator of war"
results from Malloch's bitter attack
on R.O.T.C.'s Military Ball in a Cam
pus Opinion.
Since that time various members
of the warrior class have replied
heatedly and repeatedly, summing
up with that old song: "Protect the
shore and prevent war; reserves are
what we need." This is in reply to
the Malloch lyric:'"War is so ruinous,
so unnecessary, and so foolish that
militarists should be looked upon as
no higher socially than cannibals."
However, behind this seeming song
and dance, opinions have waxed bit
ter, and a genuine conflict of princi
ples has able men and sturdy pre
paring to express themselves in the
five-minute speeches which Forum
permits bitter and cheery alike.
Jack Lesley, a bleary radical: "Our
enlightened civilization is organized
for war, one of society's foremost
traditions. On with the dance!"
Owen Ulph: "I like to see our
youth drilled for four years in the
most economical methods of slaugh
ter."
William Beckerly: "Military men
simply desire an adequate national
defense as an insurance against any
one of our war-crazed neighbors."
Jillson Peattie: "It must hearten
our Stanford women to know such
worms will strip their homes and
children of their present puny de
fense so that they will be at the
mercy of enemies when they knock
at their doors."
With Abe Mcllinkoff in the chair,
Forum will permit specific questions
to be addressed to the speakers, and
will allow free speech for all follow
ing the 10-minute talks.
Women are invited and guaranteed
protection under Forum rules. Come
