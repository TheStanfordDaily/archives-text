# Scalpers' Delight
## 
### 
lii Xcvv York (lily, ticket scalpers would gel great pleas
urc out of being near a track meet such as the one being
staged tie re Saturday. They had just oodles of fun a few
weeks ago when Walter Martv, world's high jumping
champion and featured artist in the Farm program this
week-end, drew IX.(MK) spectators.
Madison Square Garden was jammed to the rafters to
see the Fresno State College star perform. And were the
scalpers delighted? They asked—and got—slo for tickets
which were printed to retail at $2.
If Marty were all that were to he featured, the event
here still would he worth seeing. World's champions don't
go on display every afternoon, and even if Stanford is the
home of three such aces it still will be an outstanding treat
lo witness one of the new greats in action.
Stanford's own Hen Eastman, Hill Miller, and Captain
(lus Meier, all of whom hold world's marks, and Johnny
Lyman, who is an I.C.A.A.A.A. shot put record holder, will
add to the display. The great part of it is the fact that none
of these men is a certain winner. Competition will lie
keen from start to finish.
It won't be a bore to watch Saturday's program. It will
be a treat. And it stands a first-rate chance of developing
into tlie outstanding track and field program on the Stan
lord schedule this vear.
