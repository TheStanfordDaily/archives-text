# Retrospect and Reverence
## 
### 
Life ami ils problems, assertedly growing more com
plex every day, engulf the university student more and
more, place his nose constantly upon the grindstone, and
turn his eyes pointedly toward the future.
Hut in the continual round from year to year, those of
us nt Stanford have sot aside one day to pause, cast a fleet
ing glance backward, and think a reverent thought for
those generous beneficiaries who made this university pos
sible. '
Tomorrow we celebrate Founders' Day, stopping a mo
ment before finals, to pay our respects to Senator and Mrs.
Stanford, whose wise and adecpiate benevolence made "the
children of California our children" after the death of
their son for whom the rniversity they subsequently es
tablished was named.
The senior class will go in a body to the Memorial
Church, acknowledging their debt to those pioneers whose
foresight made possible the practical, yet idealistic educa
tion they have received at Stanford.
Rnumeration of Senator and Mrs. Stanford's benefits
would be superfluous. Tomorrow's ceremonies indicate in
a small way the gratitude fell by the Stanford of today
toward those who founded the Stanford of vesterdav.
