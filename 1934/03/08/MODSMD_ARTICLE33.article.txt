A "No Smoking" sign on a si rod car doesn't moan much
io tlio average collego student. Al best (he nolico is just
Iho symbol of a rosli'iclion which il's a prolly fancy thing
lo hroajv when Iho conductor isn't looking.
Hut that isn't the way things go when tradition, as old
;is the I'niversity, hangs out a "No Smoking" sign on the
Quad. The other night the Kx (Committee called this to the
attention of the campus. Perhaps it's regrettable that it
was necessary to make a special point of it.
Hnl Stanford students, professors, visitors, and janitors
for generations past have reverenced this tradition. Mrs.
Stanford asked that nobody ever smoke on the Quad. She
meant that no one was to smoke on the Outer Quadrangle,
the Inner Quadrangle, or in the classrooms, or 011 the walk
ways around the outside, or even on the stops leading up
10 the Outer Quad. The "No Smoking" sign is still up
even during nerve-racking periods like finals.
Dr. Jordan, Mrs. Stanford, and generations of Stan
forditos before ns, living in memory, speak out of the past
they ask 1/011 not lo smoke on the Quad or any part of
11 at anv time.
