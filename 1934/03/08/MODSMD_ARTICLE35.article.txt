## DOES WAR PAY?

Last year was a comparatively

armament manufacturers. They die
more business than any time since
the war. Necessary war material. l

War as a Business
War materials are moving because
many nations fear, or even expect a
war. They expect a war because il
is somebody's business to make them
expect it. This somebody is the mu
nitions manufacturer.
Last week, Fortune magazine
pulled the lid off exposing the arm. 1 -
business. There are only three large
groups of them: ohe German, one
English, erne French; but their busi
ness is not confined to these coun
tries. Far from it: France's Schnei
der-Cruesot has its finger in nearly
every juicy armament pie in Eu
rope; il owns or controls three ol the
most influential French newspapers.
Here is how the system works.
How It Works
Over a year ago, the guiding spirits
of the French and German com
panies got together, decided that
business might be better. They put
their heads together and contributed
handsomely to Hitler's campaign
fund. They did this because he was
the one man most likely to start a
war in Europe, which would of course
increase armament orders, and ulti
mately put money in their pockets.
After Hitler became Chancellor of
Germany and talked re-armament,
the French papers controlled by the
arms manufacturers hollered for big
ger and better French armaments
because French security was threat
ened. It worked; most every coun
try in Europe has been buying all
the war materials it can afford.
What It Means
Obviously peace movements might
a*, well curl up and die as long as
this sort of thing goes on. But it is
a hard thing to stop. The business
of these men is to keep each and
every nation over-armed by stirring
up super-nationalism within the
country. A war need not occur; just
as long as most people think it will
the result is the same—money for
the arms manufacturers.
But this money means employ
ment, more business, almost pros
perity for some countries. This is
why arms traffic is so hard to con
trol. Money spent for materials is
even harder to spot—.scrap iron may
make a plow as well as a gun. And
the opportunity to sell anything is
almost irresistible anyhow. So what
can be done?
Before pacifists can accomplish
their ends and internationalism even
begins to work, the arms manufac
turers will have to be controlled.
This is admittedly a super human
job. But remember it cost $25,000 to
kill each and every soldier in the
World War.

the result is the same—money for
the arms manufacturers.
But this money means employ

even harder to spot—.scrap iron may

the opportunity to sell anything is
almost irresistible anyhow. So what
can be done?
Before pacifists can accomplish
their ends and internationalism even

This is admittedly a super human
job. But remember it cost $25,000 to
kill each and every soldier in the
World War.
Last year was a comparatively

but it was. a boom year for one—the
armament manufacturers. They die
more business than any time since
the war. Necessary war material. l

lead also shared in the boom. Pa

War as a Business
War materials are moving because
many nations fear, or even expect a
war. They expect a war because il
is somebody's business to make them
expect it. This somebody is the mu
nitions manufacturer.
Last week, Fortune magazine
pulled the lid off exposing the arm. 1 -
business. There are only three large
groups of them: ohe German, one
English, erne French; but their busi
ness is not confined to these coun
tries. Far from it: France's Schnei
der-Cruesot has its finger in nearly
every juicy armament pie in Eu
rope; il owns or controls three ol the
most influential French newspapers.
Here is how the system works.
How It Works
Over a year ago, the guiding spirits
of the French and German com
panies got together, decided that
business might be better. They put
their heads together and contributed
handsomely to Hitler's campaign
fund. They did this because he was
the one man most likely to start a
war in Europe, which would of course
increase armament orders, and ulti
mately put money in their pockets.
After Hitler became Chancellor of
Germany and talked re-armament,
the French papers controlled by the
arms manufacturers hollered for big
ger and better French armaments
because French security was threat
ened. It worked; most every coun
try in Europe has been buying all
the war materials it can afford.
What It Means
Obviously peace movements might
a*, well curl up and die as long as
this sort of thing goes on. But it is
a hard thing to stop. The business
of these men is to keep each and
every nation over-armed by stirring
up super-nationalism within the
country. A war need not occur; just
as long as most people think it will
the result is the same—money for
the arms manufacturers.
But this money means employ
ment, more business, almost pros
perity for some countries. This is

trol. Money spent for materials is
