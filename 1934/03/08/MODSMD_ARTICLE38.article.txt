# CAMPUS OPINION
## FID AC QUESTIONED 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It is necessary publicly to chal
lenge the wisdom and the motives
which leads the University to accept
the FIDAC award, sponsored in this
country by the American Legion.
While a return of the medal can
hardly be expected, it is at least pos
sible to indicate that there are per
sons present with strong reasons to
distrust the principles fostered by
this organization. By accepting the
medal the University is acquiescing
in these principles, and this, I pre
sent, seriously outweighs any glory
of recognition bestowed by the
award.
The Legion commander, Hayes, in
his presentation address, used cer
tain phrases approving the awakened
internationalism and peace-consci
ousness of university students.
Speaking in the city, he employed
these same phrases to introduce a
demagogic denunciation of Commu
nism, as a threat to God, country,
family, etc. In this way international
peace and the fight against Com
munism are set up as one and the
same. Likewise in their bulletins,
FIDAC displays other confusions of
belief, e.g., preparedness for war is
not militarism; uniting the allies of
the World War does not defend the
international status quo and invite
the animosity of the defeated na
tions; "individual nationalism.'' sup
port of present capitalist govern
ments, does secure world order.
The real question here, despite the
"widow and orphan" appeals upon
which such organizations base their
mass appeal, is this: are we willing
to support, directly or indirectly, this
body which has all the potentialities
of another Black Shirt, Brown Shirt,
Heimwehr, within it? Ask yourself
the sober question: am I for the so
cialized state, or the military dicta
torship? Y'r's., etc.,
