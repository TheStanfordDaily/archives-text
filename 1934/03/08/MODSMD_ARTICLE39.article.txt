# REASONING UNNECESSARY
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The thorough going manner in
which Mr Ulph takes apart Nat Ken
dall's recent letter must be admired.
But apparently it did not occur to
Ulph that neither my letter nor
Kendall's reply to it were concerned
with being reasonable. Both were
written to influence public opinion,
! which Ulph as a pacifist should very
well know is not a process calling
for reasoned argument.
The last two paragraphs of his let
ter illustrate this. Even I, a pacifist, I
j can hardly suppose he would have
! us take literally the ridiculous pro
posal contained therein. Even so,
that portion of the letter contained i
some of the better known elements
| of propaganda, such as emotional
ized and overdrawn assertions.
Further, I resent his inference [
j that the militarists, just because their ,
opinions differ from his or mine, are '
necessarily either fools, sadists, or
hypocrites. One of the rights that
we pacifists make much of is free
dom of thought and speech, and we i
ought to be willing to extend it to
others. I am personally' acquainted
with several military men, who have
been through the Great War, would ;
prefer to see almost anything than
another war. Yet they continue to
believe that in a large army and
navy lie the peace and security of
the nation. I think they are wrong
there, but that gives me no right to
rail them either morons, hypocrites,
or sadists. Sincerely,
George Walker
