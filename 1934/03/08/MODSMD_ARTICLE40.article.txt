# MILITARISTS POISONOUS

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Strange as it may seem to army
playboys and others who weak
mindedly attempt to denounce Mal
loch, there are people (like myself)
who not only agree with him, but
are very jubilant to r.r.ow that he ,
has Ihe courage of his convictions. |
I'd as soon be seen with a man in ,
uniform as with a cobra or a rattle
snake. "Untouchable" to some, 1o
me are poisonous. I refer of course
to the ideas back of the uniforms,
not the men. Poor deluded souls,
they feel so important, so righteous.
What we need is enough Mallochs to
shove what uniforms represent into
the Dead Sea along wiih other bar
barisms.
It is always the refuge of cowards
to resort to abusive personalities in

stead of facing facts. They think it
braver to learn to kill than to iearn
to face facts. We aren't "pacifists,"
we simply think that war never pays,
but only corrupts. It may pay the
munition manufacturer (see Time,
March 5, p. 13, Munitions Men) and
ihe glory-seeking egotist, but in the
end it turns and sinks its deadly
fangs into even their brief raptures,
and destroys ihem.
Mai loch is right. Either war must
be recognized as immoral and de
generate, or all of us may as well
resign ourselves to holocausts of ex
tinction. â€”Dorcas Worsley
