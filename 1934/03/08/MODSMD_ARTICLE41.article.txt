Kl( HAfM) HARDING DAVIS: HIS
KAY, By Fairfax Downey
(Scribners' New York, 1933)
No biography of Richard Harding
Davis could be great, but any biog
raphy must be interesting. The
handsome 1 escort of the Gibson girls,
the journalist who scooped the coro
nation of Nicholas 11, the Floyd Gib
bons of the Spanish-American war,
the writer of best sellers for the*
Mauve Decade, the Richard Halli
burton of the Gay Nineties —here is a
fitting hero for another journalist.
Fairfax Downey has not attempted
a pretentious narrative nor an ironi
cal fiction; he has presented Davis as
a soldier of fortune who thrilled
America and Engbnd with stories of
Broadway or of Central American
jungles.
Davis made his first newspaper
; success under Arthur Brisbane on
"The Evening Sun," reported Cuban
troubles for Hearst's "Journal,"
which misinterpreted him to evoke
war scares; spent his earnings sump
tuously, and devoted his last two
years to helping swing the United
States into the Great War. He is in
this biography still the legend—dis
i tinctly a man, not an artist.
