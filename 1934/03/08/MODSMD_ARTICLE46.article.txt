Baseball, once the traditional col
lege sport, gets under way in earnest
today for Stanford when Harry Wol
ter takes his varsity players over 1o
Moraga for the first tussle of the
league season for the Indians.
Stanford's prospects this season
arc probably better than they have
been for many seasons past, largely
due to the fact (hat tiie Indians nave
two pitchers who stack up with the
best that will be found in college
baseball. Stan Anderson and Fred
lieringcr are the mainstays of a stall
which boasts much reserve strength
in addition to its starters.
Anderson and Heringer, both big
men capable of hurling a complete
game, will probably rank with Big
Bill Peterson of California as the
best pitchers on the Coast. All three
have good control, plenty of zip, and
a good curve.
As in last season, Clint Evans has
another strong team over at Berk
eley. The Bears have gone through
a highly successful practice season
and opened their defense of their
California Intercollegiate Baseball
Association title with two victories
over St. Mary's, scoring 2(5 runs in
the process.
Last Saturday California whipped
the Moragans 13 to 1, pounding three
(Jael hurlers for I I hits while Peter
son held the Saints to five. Tuesday
St. Mary's went down under another
avalanche of baschits, 17 altogether,
to the tune of 13 to (>.
One of the criticisms advanced
against college baseball of late years
has been the fact that it doesn't have
enough color. "Red" Strader, St.
Mary's coach, has evidently decided
to remedy that factor and his. ball
club should create quite a sensation
when it appears on the Sunken dia
mond Saturday afternoon in the sec
ond game of the Indian-Gael series
in red-white-and-blue uniforms.
Baseball once occupied the place
of honor in competition between
Stanford and California. The famous
Stanford Axe, now a trophy for the
annual Indian-Bear grid struggle,
was originally paraded by Card root
ers each spring at the time of the
baseball game betwpen the two
schools.
Although it cannot hope to replace
footfball in the hearts of college stu
dents, baseball interest has shown
signs of reviving lately in many
places and with a tight race in the
offing it may gain more support here
this season.
California has already shown its
power while Stanford, with a good
pitching stall' and a hard-hitting line
up, including Captain Dick Miles,
"Bones" Hamilton, Jim Woolley, Bob
Grayson, Art Ileum, and Ray For
sythe, should prove its power today
and Saturday.
The Trojans don't swing into ac
tion until California journeys South
to play them next Saturday, Mon
day, and Tuesday, but with a nu
cleus of veteran players, Sam Barry
will probably have another danger
<.h>- squad. U.C.'.s biggest problem is
in pitching where they will have to
replace George Buchana, the Pacific
Coast's ace hurler for the past two
seasons. â€”Tremaine
