# WATERBURY, HOLTZ ADDED TO GALAXY FOR ALL-STAR MEET
## 
### Jack Drown 
And still they come. As if the
presence of world's champion high
jumper Walter Marty and blazing
Ben Eastman were not enough for
any meet, Coach Dink Templeton
received word last night that Ed
Waterbury and Holtz, a pair of
Olympic Club stars, would also coTn
pete in Saturday's all - University
track and field classic to be staged
on Angel I Field.
Waterbury is the lad who threw
the javelin so weii for California last
year and only last Sunday in the
Olympic Club-San Francisco Uni
versity encounter, tossed the spear

211 feet. Thus a battle royal looms
between the ex-Cal star and Johnny
Mottram, Stanford's pride, who cap
tured first in the Long Beach relays
last Saturday with a titanic heave of
213 feet 4% inches.
Fast Mile Imminent
Although comparatively new to
Coast track circles, Holtz, once of
Montana University, has a mark of
v/eli under 4:20 in the mile and
promises to make the Nimmo-Bright
dual a three-way affair.
In order to provide stiffer compe
tition for Walter Marty, who has so
generously offered to exhibit his
high jumping ability Saturday for
ihe benefit of the Stanford-10-the
East move, Alley, of San Francisco
University, who has scaled six feet
four inches, has accepted an invita
tion to compete.
Beef Trust Slings
A great dual is anticipated in the
shot put when John Lyman, holder
of the IC4A record made last year,
and Slinger Dunn, who placed sec
ond to him, hook up in the 16-pound
ball event in a battle of brawn
against beef or vice versa. Should
Here Laßorde and Bobby Jones,
former Stanford IC4A champions en
ter the discus, a three-way tussle
should ensue as Dunn, who took sec
onds to Laßorde most of last season,
will be out to make it hot for his
former nemesis.
Hurdles Look Fast
In the two hurdle events, Captain
Gus Meier, Sam Klopstock, and
Cotto Herbert, last year's IC4A
champion in the low fights, and now
competing for the Olympic Club, are
all capable of record times and
should provide two of the day's big
gest track thrills.
Meier tied the accepted world's
record of 14.2 seconds in the 120-
yard flight last season in the N.C.A.A,
meet, but Sophomore Klopstock de
feated him by a scant foot over the
distance last week in the wonderful
early season time of 14.6 seconds.
Student tickets, selling for 25 cents,
remain on sale at the A.S.S.U. office
until tomorrow. Captain Meier,
chairman of the Skull and Snakes
committee sponsoring the meet,
urges all to buy early as only 55-
c<nt pasteboards will be obtainable
Saturday.

Deadline for student tickets is
Friday evening, to be had at
A.S.S.U., 8.A.C., from living
' group representatives, or parti
cipants. Regular 05-cent price
to prevail Saturday.
