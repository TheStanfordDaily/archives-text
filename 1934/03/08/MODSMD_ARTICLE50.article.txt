## 
###

end Alameda usually place pretty
close to one, two, three in the North
Coast meet every year, and look to
be fairly strong at the present.
The mile shapes up as a knockout
curtain-raiser, with the fast-improv
ing Rusty March holding up the
freshman side against a coming nug
get in Hobs Lauren of Berkeley.
March came under the wire in about
4:20 last week, while Lauren cashed
into the select group at the state

meet last year, running around 4:36.
All three schools have some fast
sprinters, while Chuck Voigt and
Fred Williams of the frosh, who are
rapidly overcoming a season of foot
ball, will probably hold a slight edge.
Voigt ran a classy 50:6 440 Tues
day, closely followed by another
frosh, Green, thus alleviating any
anxious moments for Coach Elling
ton about his relay quartet. The
other two are Rusty Marsh and Bob
Alexander, capable half-miler.
Piedmont is strong in the broad
jump, pole vault, and hurdles, and
both Berkeley and Alameda have
