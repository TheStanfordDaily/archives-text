# KIRKWOOD SPEAKS ON TREND TOWARD LAW SPECIALISTS
## 
### 
Tt-lling of a ohanging law profes- |
sion in a changing world, Dean Ma- J
lion R. Kiikwood of the Law School i
gave the seventh lecture in a series j
of vocational talks to a group of j
students in the Little Theatre last i
night.
Dean Kiikwood pointed out: "The
layman generally thinks of law as |
criminal practice, but the great bulk %
of lawyers have nothing to do with
criminal work whatever." He said
Ihe trend is toward specialization
even in civil practice. "Some law
yers," he mentioned, "are rarely seen
in a courtroom.
"The large part of the lawyer's job j
is in trying to keep clients out of ,
trouble rather than protecting them !
after they get in. Some give all their j
time to corporate, probate, and tax i
work."
Opportunities to go from the law j
into public life and big business j
were explained by Kirkwood, who j
cited statistics to show that one-half j
of the Houoc of Representatives |
("though I am not so proud to say
this") and two-thirds of the Senate j
and many of the board chairmans of j
large corporations were lawyers.
