# DRAMA COUNCIL NAMES SPRING QUARTER PLAY
## "Three Cornered Moon" To Be Given in May By Campus Cast 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
A successful stage play, one of the
outstanding films of last year, and
admittedly one of the maddest, most
delightful comedies of recent years
—"Three Cornered Moon" is t'i6
spring quarter play selection of the
Dramatic Council.
The piece is set for May produc
tion, under the general direction of
Harold Helvenston, who will conduct
tryouts on Tuesday, April 3.
Expect Competition
This is the first time that a spring
play has been announced before the
vacation, and it is hoped that the ini
tial tryouts will provide even keener
competition than usual, and that
they will be more in the nature of
final tryouts.
"Three Cornered Moon" offers
parts for nine players, four women
and five men, and all of them good
comic roles. Elizabeth, the daughter
of the insane Rimplegar family, is
the leading part, while that of Mrs.
Rimplegar offers opportunity for
some broad comedy. Among the men,
there is the romantic lead of the
young doctor, the comic part of the
young and the characters of
the three very active sons of the
family.
Stage Play
The stage version opened about a
year ago in New York, and was the
initial play of Gertrude Tonkonogy.
In the cast were Ruth Gordon as
Elizabeth, and Cecelia Loftus as Mrs.
Rimplegar.
In the motion picture Clapdette
Colbert was seen in the lead, while
Mary Boland was excellent as ihe
mother, and others in the cast were
Richard Arlen, Wallace Ford, and
Hardie Albright.
