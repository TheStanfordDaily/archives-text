# Masquers' 'Anatol' Well Received; Cast Praised
## 
### HENRY BRILL 
M a s q u e r s' reading of Arthur
Schnitzler's "Affairs of Anatol," last
night, was a tremendous success, to
judge by the applause of an enthu
siastic audience.
In every way as successful as the
popular Sword and Sandals readings,
the choice of "Anatol" for Masquers'
reappearance on the campus was a
particularly happy one. Composed of
a series of highly-comical sketches
in the gay setting of Old Vienna, it
gave each fair lady of the east the
stage for an entire scene.
Wallingford Stars
Katrina Wallingford's perform
ance, as the ballet-danccr with the
"sentimental tummy," was outstand
ing. Jean Albertson and Shelley
Smith in slightly more serious scenes
(if any could be so classified) were
also quite entertaining.
Virginia Marvin was excellent in
the opening scene. Even though
hypnotized she proved that a woman
could still deceive her lover. Mary

Ann Crury and Eleanor Harris, both
| now to campus readings, were able
to Ret much comedy out of their
! lines.
Brauns Dashing
Robert Brauns was Anatol, the
I "hero of who dashes \
| from affair to affair, refusing to be ,
disillusioned by failure. He played!
! the role with great finesse and subtle !
humor. Having the brunt of the un- !
relieved action in his hands, he sue- j
ceeded in maintaining a steady level i
i of interest and comedy. James San- !
doe as Max, the cynical but under
standing friend, made of his role one 1
of the production's highlights; once
again confirming his enviable repu- j
tation as the "man of many parts."
Stage directions were read "more
than adequately" by Elizabeth Cha
pin. Marian Jones, president of ;
Masquers and director of the read-
I ing, is to be commended for the
smoothness and the excellent light —
j ing of her production.
