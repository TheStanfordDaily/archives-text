# PETITIONS POUR IN FOR ROYALTY
## Mellinkoff, Trautman Have Names in Competition 
### Kathleen Cottrell 
Row and Hall leaders went* into
action yesterday and eight potential
Kings and live would-be Queens
were named for the all-University
popularity ballot of spring quarter.
Bobby "Look Me Over" Grayson,
Eleanor '"Hey Hey" Harris, and Abe
"I'm It" Mellinkoft were among the
first to enter the running.
Rumors of Rose "Twice-a-
Queen?" Cubbison's entering the
competition were strongly denied by
Pi Phi regulars. Whisperings from
insurgents, however, indicated that
last year's Queen would probably
run again.
Fifty Rivals Expected
As petitions swarmed into the A.S.
S.U. offices last night, Rally Com
mitteemen said they expected at
least 50 candidates. Ballots will be
distributed at the beginning of spring
quarter throughout living groups,
and each student will be allowed one
vote.
The 10 men and 10 women receiv
ing the highest number of votes will
enter the final contest for the cov
eted throne. Votes will be a penny a
ballot, and proceeds will be given to
the Convalescent Home.
Date April 20
The affair has been definitely set
for April 20. Committeemen in
charge promise the most lavish deco
rations of the year, and hint that a
well-known orchestra will be en
gaged for the event.
Additional entrants in the carnival
race up to yesterday are: Richard
"Tricky Dicky" Van Wagenen, Mar
vie "Duck Bill" Kahn, Doris "Very"
Drury, "Diamond Jim" Moscrip, Inez
"Snowshoes" Tevens, Buck "Ride
'Em Cowboy" Van Dellen, Jean
"Kappa" Albertson, "Gentleman Jer
ry" Trautman, Jane "Union" Hille
brand, and Stan "Aces" Anderson.
