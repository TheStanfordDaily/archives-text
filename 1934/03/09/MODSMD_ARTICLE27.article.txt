# Holiday Formerly Given As Founders' Day Fete
## 
### JOYCE SMART 
Celebration of Founders' Day at
Stanford has dwindled from an all
day vacation to a one-hour Univer
sity assembly which everyone at
tended, and hence tonight's concert
in the Memorial Chapel.
The original opening day, October
1, 1891, was attended by 5,000 people
who gathered from the surrounding
countryside. Formal services were
in the inner court of the Quad, and
prospective students sat about mak
ing out their curriculum, and filling
out application blanks.
Jordan Talks
President Jordan, in his talk, said:
"Our University has no history to
fall back upon It is hallowed
by no traditions; it is hampered by
none Traditions and associa
tions it is ours to make."
After this speech the roughs en
joyed a yell by the "500":
"Wah-Hoo! Wah-Hoo!
LS.J.U., Stanford!"
The first anniversaries of Foun
i

! ders' D;iy were celebrated by picnics |
and celebration on the holiday which ]
