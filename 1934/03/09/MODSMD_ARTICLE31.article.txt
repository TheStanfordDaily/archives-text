Stanford's IO.'H (rack squad is ready right now lo go out
and give any oilier man's college more than a good run for
its money in the 1.(1.1-A. meet of May 21.
Tomorrow the campus is going out to Angell Field and
watch a good-sized hunch of world heaters go through
their paces. There's plenty of money today that says that
they are likely to witness a few new collegiate records in
the making. Anyway, there is plenty of fun and plenty of
competition among some really great trackmen.
Rut that's only half the story. Roughs and coeds are
going to have a chance to he at HKM's first track meet, and
still he right there with some of the season's greatest aces.
For twenty-five cents they will he along the runway where
it'll take twice as much cash to sit at spring quarter meets
that won't possibly be any better.
Walter Marty, world's high jumping champion, sons of
the Farm including Johnny Lyman, Bill Miller, Rud Dea
con, (ins Meier, and Ren Eastman will be on hand to keep
things stepping fast.
We'll see a ten dollar show for two bits. And, bv golly,
we haven't got nerve enough to ask for more!
