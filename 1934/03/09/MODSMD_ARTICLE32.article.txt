Rranner. Dining Hall, closed for years, is a potential
place to feed about 200 hungry Stanford men. Since tltfe
I nion cafeteria has been closed to roughs, eating places
on the campus open to independents have been rather
pinched and distinctly crowded.
Lines form six deep in the Cellar for lunch, and some
of the Rranner men walk all the way over to Sequoia for
breakfast. The rest have no alternative but to go down
town and eat. The independents, men not afHliated with
any club, need another dining hall and Rranner could
adequately handle the problem.
