# A 						Final and Finals Reminder
## 
### 
This is the last printed word before finals. It's the last
flourish given to the polishing job on the "No Smoking"
sign wheih Stanford's most worthwhile tradition hangs
out on the Quad.
The campus, perhaps celebrating Founders' Day, but,
we hope, in a more permanent frame of mind, follows the
lead taken by Quadrangle Club and the Kx Committee.
"\<> Smoking" on the Quad from now on, and particularly
during finals, will be as well observed as il has been in past
yea rs.
Student leaders, in opinions printed and examples to
be emulated, are setting the pace. The rest of the campus
will follow. To comply with the true spirit of the tradition,
faculty members will not even light up the old corncob for
a few puffs in their offices.
Mrs. Stanford asked il, Stanfordites of the class of
ninctv-odd gave the pledge. Following generations kept
the promise. II falls to us to carry it on.
