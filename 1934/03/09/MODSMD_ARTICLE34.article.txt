Much scholastic water (whatever kind of fluid that, is)
will pass under the educational bridge 'twixt now and
April 2, when campus roughs and Kosies return for spring
quarter. Hut the vacation period is bound to act as a dam
in some degree, with the result that Ihe opening days of
next month will be productive of important information
affecting the entire student body.
First and foremost, the new A.S.S.I'. constitution, which
today stands near completion, will be up for voting. Sev
eral other situations, which are either not fully understood
or are not functioning as thev should be, will be thor
oughly ironed out. One thing is the dance band difficulty,
which apparently was off to a successful start last quarter
and suddenly became disorganized. Another, of course, is
the Theatre propaganda. Already, Ihe ( diversity admin
istration lias given some hints of possible methods of mak
ing outstanding improvements.
The Convalescent Home drive and Masque Hall, long
standing events which create wide student co-operation,
will be coining soon. The track team will, we hope, be
moving eastward to battle for 1.('..A.A.A.A. laurels. And
last, but not .least, what has been a loosely knit student
body will mould info a unit.
