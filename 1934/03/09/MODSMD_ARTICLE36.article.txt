## F.R. and the Air Mail 
### CROMPTON BANGS, JR 
Yesterday the President moved to
j correct his worst political mistake.
IHe "recommended" that Congress
] pass laws to return the Air Mail to
j private firms.
The Army has been carrying the
i mail for almost three weeks now.
J Eight pilots have been killed, sev
j oral more have crashed. Such a
i storm of angry protest followed
I F.R.'s drastic action in kicking out
the private lines without trial that
it soon became a question of face
saving for the Administration. In
looking at yesterday's move there
; are two things to consider: first,
j what did F.K. propose; second, what
will it mean to the private air lines?
The Plan
i Main point of the proposed law is
( that private air lines will carry the
I mail as soon as possible. Thus the
President can drop the very trouble
i some hot potato. But things will not
1 go hack to the old free for all, small
company-take-the-hmdmost days.
Contracts will run for three years
only; the top rate per pound of mail
carried will be about half the old
rate; any collusion or dirty work to
prevent competitive bidding for the
contract will, ditjg the guilty party
for good. The lucky contract win
ners can have six months to get
ready to carry the mail—if they need
it. Finally, the hard-boiled, grai'tless
Interstate Commerce Commission
will watch over things — not the
Postoffice Department. What will
this mean to the private air com
panies?
What It Means?
There is one thing certain: several
former air mail carriers will not get
any contracts. One of the first things
in the Air Mail New Deal will be
another shuffle; in the process the
black sheep will be booted out into
the cold. Some of the largest com
panies will be among the black
sheep. Before they can have a
Chinaman's chance, they will have
to be pretty well re-organi/.ed—es
pecially at the top.
A few large lines have a clean bill
of health and will probably be car
rying the mail in a month or so.
And the little fellows will get a
whack at the contracts for, the first
time; that is what the six month
get-ready period means. But there
will be only half as much in carry
ing the mail as before. This means
that quite a few routes will be aban
doned or flown by the Army. In the
future private lines will have to de
pend more on passengers and ex
press and ltjs on mail.
What Has It Cost?
Regardless of how quickly the air !
mail is handed over, the President j
has lost a great deal of popularity ;
in the Air Mail mix-up. This new
plan is a face-saving proposition,
and face-saving propositions seldom
get votes; they usually lose quite a j
few. This has been true on the Pa
cific Coast, where many were really
"het-up" about it all. The mail
service, even after the Sierra storms, j
has been only 50 per cent efficient. !
The whoi.e mess is probably the re- !
suit of acting first and thinking af- I
tcrwards.

The whoi.e mess is probably the re- !
suit of acting first and thinking af- I
tcrwards.
Yesterday the President moved to
j correct his worst political mistake.
IHe "recommended" that Congress
] pass laws to return the Air Mail to
j private firms.
The Army has been carrying the
i mail for almost three weeks now.
J Eight pilots have been killed, sev
j oral more have crashed. Such a
i storm of angry protest followed
I F.R.'s drastic action in kicking out
the private lines without trial that
it soon became a question of face
saving for the Administration. In
looking at yesterday's move there
; are two things to consider: first,
j what did F.K. propose; second, what
will it mean to the private air lines?
The Plan
i Main point of the proposed law is
( that private air lines will carry the
I mail as soon as possible. Thus the
President can drop the very trouble
i some hot potato. But things will not
1 go hack to the old free for all, small
company-take-the-hmdmost days.
Contracts will run for three years
only; the top rate per pound of mail
carried will be about half the old
rate; any collusion or dirty work to
prevent competitive bidding for the
contract will, ditjg the guilty party
for good. The lucky contract win
ners can have six months to get
ready to carry the mail—if they need
it. Finally, the hard-boiled, grai'tless
Interstate Commerce Commission
will watch over things — not the
Postoffice Department. What will
this mean to the private air com
panies?
What It Means?
There is one thing certain: several
former air mail carriers will not get
any contracts. One of the first things
in the Air Mail New Deal will be
another shuffle; in the process the
black sheep will be booted out into
the cold. Some of the largest com
panies will be among the black
sheep. Before they can have a
Chinaman's chance, they will have
to be pretty well re-organi/.ed—es
pecially at the top.
A few large lines have a clean bill
of health and will probably be car
rying the mail in a month or so.
And the little fellows will get a
whack at the contracts for, the first
time; that is what the six month
get-ready period means. But there
will be only half as much in carry
ing the mail as before. This means
that quite a few routes will be aban
doned or flown by the Army. In the
future private lines will have to de
pend more on passengers and ex
press and ltjs on mail.
What Has It Cost?
Regardless of how quickly the air !
mail is handed over, the President j
has lost a great deal of popularity ;
in the Air Mail mix-up. This new
plan is a face-saving proposition,
and face-saving propositions seldom
get votes; they usually lose quite a j
few. This has been true on the Pa
cific Coast, where many were really
"het-up" about it all. The mail
service, even after the Sierra storms, j
has been only 50 per cent efficient. !
