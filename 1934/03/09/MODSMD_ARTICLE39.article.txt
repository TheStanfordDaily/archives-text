GALLANT LADY (20th Century)
Coming to the Stanford Theatre
March 18
Incredible as it may seem, Ann
Harding at last has a good picture.
"Gallant Lady" is neither brilliant
comedy nor compelling drama, yet it
is surely one of the most delightful
pictures to emerge from Hollywood
in a long, long time.
The pleasurableness of the film is
due to a happy combination of a
lovely star with an excellent sur
rounding cast, an interesting if not
weighty story with good dialogue,
and intelligent direction with above
average photography. All of which
may sound fairly hyperbolical, but
that is simply the effect that this
charming picture produces.
The old story of the mother who
surrenders her child at its birth, only
to find him later and be reunited
with hini, is refreshingly varied by
three slight romances and some inci
dental complications.
Miss Harding is not called upon to
do a great deal of acting, but that she
does in her usually delightful man
ner, aided by her fine voice. And she
wear's an amazing number of lovely
gowns.

! Tullio Carminati and Clive Brook
are the male principals, v»ith the for
mer perhaps more impressive be
cause one has grown accustomed to
I a fine, sincere performance from
Brook. Carminati is a wholly en
-1 gaging personality, and has a pleas
ant singing voice. Brook's perform
ance is excellent, as always, and he
• 1
injects a fine dry humor as well.
Janet Beecher, an impressive new
comer, is excellent in a minor role,
, as is Dickie Moore. —Chapin
