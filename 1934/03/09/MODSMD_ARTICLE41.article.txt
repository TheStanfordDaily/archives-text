: The Editor, Sir:
It is a matter of common knowl
j edge that the University's Tuesday
night lecture programs have been
of high calibre—appreciated by the
intellectually thinking students of
j this university. Now the dramatics
department, again seeking cheap
i publicity, has taken over the last of
1 this quarter's series by sponsoring
j an opus called "Acting Through the
j Ages."
It seems a shame that a lecture
! series such as the one now coming
to a successful conclusion should be
marred by such a display of non
sense (as this show promises, so
| help me!) We understand, through
j authentic sources, that "Acting
, Through the Ages" is no more than
! a series of comic sketches, sexy, un
i educational. Fie.
Why can't the Dramatics depart
| ment save such shows for the more
j frivolous type of audience, anl leave
; the lecture series unblotched? There
is no doubt that such an "epoch" is
1 capable of drawing a capacity au
i dience, but why must it be?
And so, being a regular attendant
! at the lecture series, I say, "DAMN!"
to "Acting Through the Ages."
1 DAMN, oh DAMN!
Yours truly,
Don Cady

i The Editor, Sir:
j Are we to attribute the recent se
i ries of explosions to the minds of
' fairly mature university men, or j
| should we not explain their utter
childishness as products of sup
pressed and perverted emotional -
! ism? For how can any supposedly
j sensible individual believe that
! through such immature outbursts of j

emotion he can influence public j
opinion and rally supporters to his
cause? Needless to say, I refer to j
the recent bickerings over militar
ism. From what was initially a criti- j
cism of the P.lilitary Ball, the dis- 1
cussion has been carried to every
conceivable thing that is remotely i
connected with militarism.
In view ol' the fact that we are j
university men and women, and that j
we are rapidly becoming essential I
participants in our political, as well j
as economic and intellectual society, j
it should behoove us to exercise j
reasonable and intelligent criticism !
when questioning the declarations ;
of one of our fellows. But has this j
been done? Decidedly not! As the |
editor wisely pointed out, the only j
opposition that has been given is in j
respect to the man himself. There !
was no evidence in any of the re- j
plies of a careful and intelligent !
analysis of the point of view to see
whether or not there was some- \
thing to Mr. Malloch's contention. I
am not defending this gentleman, !
for he showed as little tact and dis- |
crimination as his objectors. What I i
do contend is that college men
should not offer mere ranting and
raving as substitutes for argument. [
Such a display as we have been see- j
ing tends to negate the general sup- j
position of the public that college ;
men are both intelligent and genteel. ,

i The Editor, Sir:
j Are we to attribute the recent se
i ries of explosions to the minds of
' fairly mature university men, or j
| should we not explain their utter
childishness as products of sup
pressed and perverted emotional -
! ism? For how can any supposedly
j sensible individual believe that
! through such immature outbursts of j

emotion he can influence public j
opinion and rally supporters to his
cause? Needless to say, I refer to j
the recent bickerings over militar
ism. From what was initially a criti- j
cism of the P.lilitary Ball, the dis- 1
cussion has been carried to every
conceivable thing that is remotely i
connected with militarism.
In view ol' the fact that we are j
university men and women, and that j
we are rapidly becoming essential I
participants in our political, as well j
as economic and intellectual society, j
it should behoove us to exercise j
reasonable and intelligent criticism !
when questioning the declarations ;
of one of our fellows. But has this j
been done? Decidedly not! As the |
editor wisely pointed out, the only j
opposition that has been given is in j
respect to the man himself. There !
was no evidence in any of the re- j
plies of a careful and intelligent !
analysis of the point of view to see
whether or not there was some- \
thing to Mr. Malloch's contention. I
am not defending this gentleman, !
for he showed as little tact and dis- |
crimination as his objectors. What I i
do contend is that college men
should not offer mere ranting and
raving as substitutes for argument. [
Such a display as we have been see- j
ing tends to negate the general sup- j
position of the public that college ;
men are both intelligent and genteel. ,

It is a matter of common knowl
j edge that the University's Tuesday
night lecture programs have been
of high calibre—appreciated by the
intellectually thinking students of
j this university. Now the dramatics
department, again seeking cheap
i publicity, has taken over the last of
1 this quarter's series by sponsoring
j an opus called "Acting Through the
j Ages."
It seems a shame that a lecture
! series such as the one now coming
to a successful conclusion should be
marred by such a display of non
sense (as this show promises, so
| help me!) We understand, through
j authentic sources, that "Acting
