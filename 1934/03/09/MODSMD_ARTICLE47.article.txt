# Rolph Malloch Wins Plaudits of Forum In Debate on War
## Audience Enthusiastic In Discussion of R.O.T.C. Condemnation 
### 
Ogden Nash, versus Joe Penner on
whether or not civilization should be
condemned was the result of last
night's Public Forum in the Geology
Building in which the official topic
was supposed to be, "Should the
R.O.T.C. be condemned?" with Rolph
Malloch upholding the affirmative
and Bill Rogers the negative.
A crowd of approximately three '
hundred furnished sound effects, i
and very effective ones they were, !
too. Abe Mellinkoff was the referee, j
Malloch First Speaker
Malloch led off the discussion with |
a diplomatic parable which effec
tively blackened the eye of militar- j
ism and war in general. He contin- j
used, with a few interruptions from |
the floor, to condemn war &s a j
means of enriching a few producers j
of armaments at the expense of the
youth and beauty and pocketbooks j
of the nations involved. In Mal
loch's mind a solution lay in drag
ging the social standing of militarists I
to a level which would keep the ,
average citizen from wishing to be I
a part of the militaristic system.
Rogers' career in the speakers' ;
rostrum was ever so much more'
stormy. The listeners by that time |
were thoroughly aroused and the J
questions often left the speaker j
gasping for breath. Apparently to |
his own surprise Rogers discovered i
that was had been the chief means I
for the progress of civilization, and
although he admitted that he hated ,
to believe it, civilization would bog |
down into a state of inertia with- 1
out an occasional war to stir up its
blood.
Rogers Heckled
On account of the continued heck
ling Rogers was unable to stay on
any one point of his argument long
enough to effectively drive it home,
and the many questions led him fur
ther and further from the question !
of the R.O.T.C.
In the general discussion after the
two speakers had finished there was !
a general free for all with a reserve
officer copping the honors with his
five-minute speech entitled "War Is
Hell." The forum's weak-kneed, if
benevolent, bureaucracy had decided
no vote was to be taken, but hon
ors, to the interested spectator,
seemed to rest with the pacifists, j
who didn't lose their heads.
