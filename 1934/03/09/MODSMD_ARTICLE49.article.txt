# Mrs. Stanford's Gift of Jewels Saved Trustees
## 
### 
On Founders' Day it is fitting
to recall the history of the Jewel
Fund of which few students
know, hut have seen the symbol
of innumerable times.
When the University's exis
tence was threatened 30 years
ago due to finances, Mrs. Stan
ford generously sold her jewels
which brought half a million
dollars. The Trustees were
given the money, which' they
put into a fund, the proceeds
from which to buy books and
publications. Such books have
a special book-plate.
The book-plate typifies Ath
ene, goddess of learning, pano
plied with helmet, seated, re
ceiving from Clio, muse of
history, gifts. Athene in return
bestows upon Clio a symbol of
Liberty. The work was exe
cuted by Edwin Jlowland Blash
field, eminent artist, of New
York.
