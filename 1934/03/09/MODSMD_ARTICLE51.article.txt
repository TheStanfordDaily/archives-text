As the final Tuesday evening per
formance of the quarter the Public
Exercises Committee will present
"Drama Through the Ages," an elab
orate pageant under the general di
rection of Harold Helvenston. Ad
mission will be free.
The performance is the outcome of
this quarter's work in Helvenston's
acting and directing classes, in which
was systematically traced the history
of the drama, through the medium
of brief but pointed scenes.
The sequence begins with a con
jectural scene depicting the begin
nings of the drama, and progresses
successively through Dionysian fes
tival, Greek tragedy and comedy,
Roman drama, mystery and morality
plays, comedia dell'arte, Elizabethan,
Restoration, and 18th century drama,
19th century melodrama, and con
cluding with a modern sophisticated
drama.
The production merits especial in
terest in that it is the work of student
actors and directors, and indicates
the progress of those classes. It is
interesting also to note that every
member of the acting class will ap
pear in at least one of the evening's
selections.
Some of tlie most prominent cam
pus actors and actresses are among
those scheduled to perform, includ
ing Jean Albertson, Kay Arthur,
Robert Dwan, George Leavens, Sher
man McFedries, Shelley Smith, Vir
ginia Marvin, and Katrina Walling
ford. *
The hour, as usual, is 7:30.
