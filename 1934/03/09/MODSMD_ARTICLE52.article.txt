# Cardinal Swim Team Favored To Beat Bears
## 
### 
For the first time since 1919, the
Stanford swimming team will be
really uneasy as it enters its annual
Big Meet with California tomorrow
afternoon at 1 o'clock.
Stanford is still favored to with
stand the Bear invasion of Encina
pools tomorrow, but the Card advan
tage is very slim, and many of the
'.â€¢aces in which Indian swimmers are
favored are rated so close that up
sets are possible in nearly every
event on the program.
The meet will be held before the
track meet, which is scheduled to
get under v/ay at 2 o'clock.
Frosh Evenly Matched
In connection with the varsity
meet, yearling teams from the two
schools >vill . tangle in their Big
Meet. The two programs will be run
off simultaneously, with each var
sity event following a frosh event.
Both meets will be close. The
events also will be close. And to top
this off. old Pacific Coast Intercolle
giate, National Intercollegiate, and
meet records are almost certain to
go into the discard.
Strong in Relays
The Card varsity strength will lie
in the relay, breast stroke, back
stroke, and medley relay. Califor
nia is rated heavy favorite in the 220
and 440-yard free style races.
There will be a three-way dual in
two races that should be worth
watching, a dual in which one or
both records may fall. Henry God
man and Johnny Gardner, Stanford,
and Ed Davis, rated the best Bear
short-distance splasher of all time,
will tangle in the 50 and 100-yard
dashes, and all of these men may
finish within a yard of each other.
Good Diving Expected
Don Corey, Bear diving ace, and
Tom Boothe of the Cards are ex
pected to stage a great exhibition,
With Milt Friedman, Indian entry
who has shown a vast improvement
in the past week, putting forth a
bold front and possibly even win
ning.
Coach Nort Thornton is confident
of his team's superiority in the 400-
yard relay that he will keep Godman
and Gardner fresh for the individual
races.

Music for UCLA'y interfraternal
ball was furnished by the orchestras
of Guy Lombardo, Kay Kyser, and
Jack Dunn.
