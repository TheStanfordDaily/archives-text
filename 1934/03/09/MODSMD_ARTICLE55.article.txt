# Stanford Music Classes Stress General Culture
## 
### Russell Paine 
The relation of music lo life as a
basis for general culture is the novel
approach which is being made in the
sludy of music at Stanford. The
traditional conservatory type of in
struction with emphasis on individ
ual performance is giving way to the
contemporary demand for creative
interest in the fine arts.
Warren D. Allen, University or
ganist and lecturer in music, is for
warding this movement in carrying
out his vision of a real contribution

by Stanford to the evolution of mu- |
sical thought.
With 50 students registered for his
winter quarter course in Musical j
Fundamentals, Allen is looking for j
an increased registration in the new
course to be offered spring quarter,
[ "Music in History." Of a non-tech
nical character, this course will con
nect music up with history, with an
interpretation of cultural growth in
cluded.
This new idea in music will be fur

ther carried uui cLatng summer
quarter by Henry Co well, well
known music lecturer, performer,
composer, and author. He will give
two courses: "Music Systems of the
World" and "Appreciation of Mod
ern Music."
Cowell has recently written a
book, "American Composers on
American Music: A Symposium,"
v hieh was published at the Stanford
University Press in 1933.
His courses are intended for the
audiences of the future who will find
in thoroughly-grounded musical un
derstanding another means of appre
ciating the work of masters.
Mrs. Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge
of Boston will also add incentive to
the summer music program.
