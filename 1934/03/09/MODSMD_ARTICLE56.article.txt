With more outside talent being
imported all the time, in addition to
Stanford's own champions, it looks
us though tomorrow's all-University
track meet will resemble a miniature
Olympic Games.
Such men as Walter Marty, Eon
Eastman, John Lyman, Gordon
Dunn, Johnny Mottram, Ed Water
bury, Gus Meier, Chuck Nimmo, Abe
Hables, Norman Bright, Bill Miller,
and Bud Deacon aren't found in the
'everyday, common garden variety of
track meet. Tomorrow's affair may
produce some of, the best records
made on the Coast this season.
ALWAYS CHANCE
FOR BROKEN RECORDS
Although it is still early in the sea
son, with such champions present as
will be here tomorrow, records are
always in danger. Walter Marty, the
Fresno high jurap ace, has already
broken his own world's record twice
this year, and will probably make
another assault on it tomorrow. Six
feet nine inches is a long way up,
but Farm track fans may see a man
leap that high tomorrow for the first
time in history if conditions suit
Marty's taste.
Bill Miller and Bud Deacon have
been flirting with world pole vault
marks for several years, Miller hold
ing it for a short time Although
neither have tonic close to it as yet
this season, this warm weather puts
a lot of spring into jumpers' legs,
and it wouldn't be surprising to see
one of them clear 14 feet and come
close to Bill Graber's world record
of 14 feet 4% inches.
Although records probably won't
fall, great duals are expected be
tween Eastman and Blackman in the
440, Nimmo, Bright, and Holtz in the
mile, Thorns and Hables in the
sprints, Mottram and Waterbury in
the javelin, Dunn and Lyman in the
weights, Meier and Klopstock in the
hurdles, and Zaches and Williams in
the broad jump.

I ALL IN TANK
Preceding the track meet, Noil
Thornton's swimming team, one of
the strongest in several years, will
tangle with California's powerful
squad in their Big Meet which may
see several records fall by the way
side.
Johnny Gardner, ace sprinter, is
expected to lop something from his
own Pacific Coast Intercollegiate
mark in the 100-yard dash, n Wed
nesday's time trials, he covered the
distance in 53.3, 1.5 seconds better
than the mark he now holds.
The National Collegiate record for
the 300-yard medley may also be
dropped by Captain Bob Clarke. In
order to give him a chance to break
the record, a special race will be held
in this event which will count no
points toward the team total, but
which will make his mark official if
ho sets a new record.—Tremaine

With more outside talent being
imported all the time, in addition to
Stanford's own champions, it looks
us though tomorrow's all-University
track meet will resemble a miniature
Olympic Games.
Such men as Walter Marty, Eon
Eastman, John Lyman, Gordon
Dunn, Johnny Mottram, Ed Water
bury, Gus Meier, Chuck Nimmo, Abe
Hables, Norman Bright, Bill Miller,
and Bud Deacon aren't found in the
'everyday, common garden variety of
track meet. Tomorrow's affair may
produce some of, the best records
made on the Coast this season.
ALWAYS CHANCE
FOR BROKEN RECORDS
Although it is still early in the sea
son, with such champions present as
will be here tomorrow, records are
always in danger. Walter Marty, the
Fresno high jurap ace, has already
broken his own world's record twice
this year, and will probably make
another assault on it tomorrow. Six
feet nine inches is a long way up,
but Farm track fans may see a man
leap that high tomorrow for the first
time in history if conditions suit
Marty's taste.
Bill Miller and Bud Deacon have
been flirting with world pole vault
marks for several years, Miller hold
ing it for a short time Although
neither have tonic close to it as yet
this season, this warm weather puts
a lot of spring into jumpers' legs,
and it wouldn't be surprising to see
one of them clear 14 feet and come
close to Bill Graber's world record
of 14 feet 4% inches.
Although records probably won't
fall, great duals are expected be
tween Eastman and Blackman in the
440, Nimmo, Bright, and Holtz in the
mile, Thorns and Hables in the
sprints, Mottram and Waterbury in
the javelin, Dunn and Lyman in the
weights, Meier and Klopstock in the
hurdles, and Zaches and Williams in
the broad jump.
RECORDS MAY ALSO
I ALL IN TANK
Preceding the track meet, Noil
Thornton's swimming team, one of
the strongest in several years, will
tangle with California's powerful
squad in their Big Meet which may
see several records fall by the way
side.
Johnny Gardner, ace sprinter, is
expected to lop something from his
own Pacific Coast Intercollegiate
mark in the 100-yard dash, n Wed
nesday's time trials, he covered the
distance in 53.3, 1.5 seconds better
than the mark he now holds.
The National Collegiate record for
the 300-yard medley may also be
dropped by Captain Bob Clarke. In
order to give him a chance to break
the record, a special race will be held
in this event which will count no
points toward the team total, but
which will make his mark official if
ho sets a new record.—Tremaine
