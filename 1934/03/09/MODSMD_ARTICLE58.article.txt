# Varsity Nine Beats Gaels in League Game
## INDIANS EKE OUT 9-8 VICTORY OVER ST. MARY'S TEAM 
### CHUCK CLANCY 
Wobbling uncertainly through
nine innings the varsity baseball
; team scored a precarious 9 to 8 vic
tory over St. "Mary's yesterday at
Moraga in the Conference opener.
St. Mary's who had earlier in the
week fallen easy victims to Cali-
J l'ornia in two lop-sided games,
: fought the Indians tooth and nail
all the way.
Gaels Tic Score
After Stanford had scored two
runs in the first inning the Gaels
I came'back in their half of the same
; frame to tio the score when Stan
Anderson walked two men who
j scored on Jimmy Kane's double
| down the left field foul line.
Stanford forged into the load in
the third to make the score 5 to 2,
but again the fighting Gaels were
not to be denied, countering with a
three-run rally in the same inning
, to take a 5 to 4 lead and sending
Stan Anderson to the showers. Fred
Heringer took over the duties at this
point and retired the side.
Four Hits in Fifth
Four hits in the fifth inning
counted for five runs to give the
Cardinals a margin of victory which
remained urithreatened until the
eighth. In this inning the Gaels ral
lied to count three runs falling short
of tieing the score when Heringer
safely retired Pitcher Jimmy Flynn
and Jerry Marinovich, second base
man, with the ticing run on second
base.
Art Hearn, Card first sacker, was
the outstanding • batter of the day
with four hits, all singles, in six
trips. Captain Dick Miles got two
for four.
Stanford will tackle St. Mary's in
a return game here tomorrow at
3:30 o'clock on the Sunken diamond
