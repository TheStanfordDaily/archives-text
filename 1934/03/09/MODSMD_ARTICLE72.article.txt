# FRESHMAN TRACK TEAM FACES ALAMEDA PREP STARS HERE TOMORROW MORNING
## 
### 
Coach Bill Ellington's babe track
squad will lace an opponent tough
in numbers, probably weak in good
performers, tomorrow morning when
the combined cinder aggregations of
the Alameda County Athletic League
make their annual journey to Angell
Field for a 10:30 o'clock meeting.
Alameda High and the Yellow
jackets of Berkeley High will make
up the bulk of the all-star team,
having shown, in the past few years,
greater strength in this sport than
the other two schools, Piedmont and
Richmond. In the broad-iump, pole
vault, and possibly sprints the preps
should claim more than their half of
the points, while in the weights they
are almost a cinch to be shut out.
Tomorrow may be the day for
Chuck Voigt to break 50 flat in the
quarter, providing that Ellington
chases to run Faye with Williams in
the sprints, leaving Voigt for the
one-lap race.
The half-mile will probably prove
another great duel between Bob Al
-1 exander and Bill McCurdy such as
these two frosh have staged on the
past two Saturdays. Alexander's bet
ter condition has given him a two or
three yard advantage at the tape
both times, but the warm weather

of the past week coupled with plenty
of work should find McCurdy, who
has a 1:58 prep mark, ready to match
Alexander's drive down the last
straight-away.
Two J.C. meets will follow Satur
day's prep competition for the frosh:
Menlo on March 24 and Sacramento
on April 17.
