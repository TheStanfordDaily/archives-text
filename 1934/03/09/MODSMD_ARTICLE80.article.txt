# Health Director Leaves For Six Weeks' Cruise
## 
### 
March 22, the last day of finals,
may mean anguish to many, but for
Dr. Walter H. Brown, director of
University Health Service, it means
the sailing date for a six months' re
search and pleasure trip around the
world. Mrs. Walter Brown and son,
Philip, a freshman at Stanford, will
accompany him.
After enjoying some of the high
lights of the Orient and Asio Minor,
the party will disembark at Naples.
From Naples they will continue in
their own car, previously shipped to
this point.
