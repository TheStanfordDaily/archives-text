## Three Women Will Appear Soon Before Women's Group for Trial YEAR'S TOTAL IS SEVEN Meier Urges That Suspicion Be Avoided in Exams 
### Jack M. Newman 
Cracking down on honor code vio
lators, the Men's Council demon
strated in the final week of winter
quarter that the teeth in the en
forcement machinery are still sharp
when they tried and convicted four
code offenders. Each was given a
three-quarter suspension. One case
is still pending before the Council.
Three women have been brought
before the Women's Council and
charged with somewhat similar of
fenses. Their cases have been con
tinued into this quarter for final
judgment.
The convicted violators were from
two courses, "Westward Movement"
and "Biology I." The violations were
reported to the council by both stu
dents and faculty members.
Frosh Involved
The first case involved two fresh
men, roommates in Encina, who
found "the air in the classroom,
where the "Biology I" examination
was being given, too stifling," left
the room and drove out behind the
golf course. There they parked and
wrote the examination.
The professor picked the two
papers out of a class of 80 as code
violators. They had the same true
and false questions falsely answered.
Essay questions were answered with
the same material, though written in
a different style.
Have "IV' Average
The students have B- averages in
the courses until the time of the ex
amination. One had a B average in
his entire course of study, while the
other was on probation at the time
he took the examination.
Both of the freshmen attended the
honor code meeting held by ex«
Council Chairman Ernie Arbuckle
at the beginning of the winter quar
ter. At this meeting they were told
of the code and all its provisions, so
they could not plead ignorance.
Use Books
The second case was of a student
in "Westward Movement." He had
written the exam up to a question
that dealt with a specific book on
the outside reading list which was
in the Reserve Book Room. After
completing the remaining questions
the offender left the classroom for a
short walk.
He passed the library and decided
to check his answer with the ref
erence book. He took the book from
the reserve desk and spent sev«ral
minutes going over it, then returned
to the examination and turned in his
bluebook.
The examination paper showed
that the first two paragraphs of the
question were answered in a general
way; the last paragraphs contained
detailed accounts of the material
given in the book taken from the
library.
Answer Exact
The case also in "Westward Move
ment." The man left the classroom
after some minutes of writing for a
walk around the Quad. He was on
the point of returning to the exami
nation when he noticed his brother
near the library and walked over for
.1 chat. He later returned to the
classroom. Records in the Reserve
Book Room show that the brother
look out the book on which the exam
dealt at 9:30 o'clock. The examina
tion papet shows an exact knowl
edge of minute detail.
The case pending before the Coun
cil now deals with the brother who
checked out the book at the library.
Seven Cases Tride
This brings the total of Council's
honor code cases tip to seven for the
year. There have been five suspen
rions, one acquital, and one continu
, c.nee.

Council Chairman Gus Meier urged
