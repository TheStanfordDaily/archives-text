# Pages Leave Magazines; Librarian Seeks Thief
## 
### 
Ripping pages bodily from sev
eral reference volumes of magazines
in the periodical room of the library,
an unknown student late last quar
ter threw a whole class into con
fusion when they attempted to find
the references.
The class, one studying political
parlies, had been assigned a paper
on the 1932 election, and when stu
dents looked up the references given
they found that someone, probably
one of the class, had removed the
whole list, according to Nathan Van
Patten, director of University Li
braries.
Van Patten announced a reward
of $25 would await the person re
sponsible for arrest und conviction
of the over-enthusiastic political
scientist.
