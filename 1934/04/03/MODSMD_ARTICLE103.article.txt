mile, has been announced by Di
rector Earl Lee Kelly, of the state
public works department.
Cost of the improvement is esti

represents Palo Alto's share of the
one-fourth-cent gasoline tax alloca
tion. Fifty thousand dollars has been
budgeted by the state highway com
mission from NRA funds, $5,000 from
state highway funds, and the re

Santa Clara County Board of Su

Construction work will be done
through state offices either by con
tract or by state forces.
