# What the World Did During Finals, Holiday
## 
### DAVID MELLINKOFF 
When Daily staff members started
vacationing March 9, and Stanford
students started spring vacationing,
world news took no rest. Press
wires have continued to buzz with
murders, jailbreaks, strikes, and in
ternational malodors.
To Americans, WASHINGTON
was at the center of the boiling
cauldron: F.D.R., now fishing from
the Astor yacht Nourmahal, looked
back on one major and one minor
defeat suffered at the hands of his
Congress. Both Senate and House
had overridden his bonu.j veto; the
Senate had rejected his St. Law
rence Waterway treaty.
As army flyers continued to crash
on temporary air mail assignments,
plans went forward for a unified
federal air department. New private
air contracts were called for.
CWA dissolved into another literal
concoction, the SERA. Labor on 1
the loose all over the nation agreed !
to aribtrate troubles with auto, rail, !
and dock magnate at the special
behest of the President. Charges 1
that braintrusters were seeking to i
turn America into a Communistic
state, were using F.R. as a dupe,
have led to a congressional inquiry.
THE NATION AT LARGE: Dil- ;
linger still on the loose; Welfare Is
land and Wisconsin's state hospital
at Oshkosh growing more rotten
with every dispatch; A1 Smith out
as editor of New Outlook; and still
no market for ambergris.
EUROPE: Italy, Austria, and
Hungary in trade pact; Hitler de
clares lie will tolerate "no zeros"
in his government; II Duce reveals 1
a 60-year plan for Italian suprem
acy; Austria becomes a "federal
state"; Stavisky exhumed for au- 1
topsy. Governments busy passing
large navy bills to keep up with U.S.
$750,000,000 Vinson appropriation.
Alter two weeks of romantic eva
sion, gray old Sam Insull and "Mai
otis" nabbed at Istanbul.
THE EAST: Japan's worst fire I

! since the 1923 holocaust brings death
to 1500 residents of Hakodate. Jap
anese Minister Hirota and Secre
tary Hull exchange broad, harmo
; nious peace notes. C. C. Julian,
skipping Arizona bail on fraud
charges, commits suicide in Shang-
I hai. Filipinos happy over independ
ence bill (freedom in 10 years, U.S.
army out of the Islands). Henry
Pu-Yi crowned emperor of new
Manchukuan state.
NICARAGUA: Rebel Sandino, for
mer U.S. Marine prey, betrayed,
ambushed, assassinated.
IN GENERAL; War pictures still
appearing in Hearst papers, now
with Dickens' "Life of Our Lord."
Congressional I.Q.'s unchanged.
