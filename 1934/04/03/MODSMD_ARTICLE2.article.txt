# Tryouts Held For Quarter's Drama Tonight
## Three-Cornered Moon Has Nine Comic Parts 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
In preparation for Harold Hel
j venston's spring quarter play of
I merry madness, tryouts lor "Three
; Cornered Moon" will be held to
| night in the Assembly Hall at 7:15
j o'clock.
As usual, all students except
freshmen women are eligible, and
j it is hoped that there will be a
; large turnout for this, the last play
of the quarter. Inasmuch as the
selection of the play was announced
at the end of last quarter, tonight's
tryouts should be more final and
competition should be noticeably
' keener.
Tonkonogy Author
j Gertrude Tonkonogy is the author
; of "Three-Cornered Moon," which
1 opened to a successful run in New
! York last year, with Ruth Gordon
! in the leading role of Elizabeth and
| Cecelia Loftus as Mrs. Rimplegar.
The play offers a wide variety of
j parts, particularly for feminine
i contenders. Elizabeth is the lead
| ing character, the slightly hysterical
( and very amusing daughter of the
| insane Rimplegar family, which is
| headed by the completely scatter
j brained Mrs. Rimplegar, whose
j abandoned toying with the stock
i market creates the havoc about
| which the play centers.
Kitty Flitty
j Kitty is the gay flapper, who
i offers a good deal of comedy, and
| there is Jenny the maid, who has
| corsiderable difficulty with English.
There are five male roles, includ-
I ing the three sons of the family,
I whose varied interests and romances
j are important to the comedy's ac
| tion. Dr. Alan Stevens is the friend
|of the family who finally assists
l them in straightening out their very
| confused affairs. The fifth role is
! that of Elizabeth's poet-sweetheart
I and one with much comic opportu
| nity.
