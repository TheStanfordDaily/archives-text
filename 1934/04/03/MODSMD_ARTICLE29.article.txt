Income Drops
The report reflected the effect ©f
; hard times on the University. In
| come fell from three million to
700,000 last year. Reasons were: (1)
I Fewer students, so fewer $I} 4
| checks; (2) less income from in
i vestments- more bonds in defaulj;
(3) less income from dormitoriejs,
hospitals. Gifts to the University
also fell considerably—s72,ooo to be
exact. ;
Salaries Slashed
To meet this 10 per cent drop
income, two things were done. Fa< -
ulty salaries above $1000 were ct it
10 per cent starting last May. Oth< r
reductions were spread prettly
evenly through all departments.
The report points out that because
j of accumulating reserves in good
times, the University was able to
postpone slashing salaries longer
j than most colleges.
Enter the SOO
But some way had to be found to
increase the income from registra
tions, which dropped over $110,000
in a year. Enrollment of men stu
dents had fallen steadily during the
depression, until last October when
all having the required credits were
admitted. Apparently the only thing
( to do was to admit all the properly
prepared women. The only way to
do this was to abolish the 500 limit
set by Mrs. Stanford in 1903.
Last May, the Trustees decided to
; abolish this limitation, and increase
the number of women to a two to
ihree ratio with thfc men. 800 wo
men instead of 500 this year made
up for the decline in men's regis
trations, and thus stopped the rapid
j fall in income from this source.
Scant Surplus
With the 10 per cent salary slash
and c:ireful management, the Uni
versity with $300,000 less income
kept in the black by the scant mar
gin of $2000. At the same time, the
size of the teaching staff was main-
I tained intact.
The effect of the increased num
ber of women on income will not
! be shown until the next report, cov
ering the current year. So far,
income from registrations has in
creased slightly, bpt the University
is still running on a very close mar
i gin. With the gradual return of
prosperity, increased income from
investments and registrations may
make things look considerably
1 brighter.
