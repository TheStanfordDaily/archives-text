Along with numerous oilier universities throughout the
nation, Stanford benefitted to the extent of $1770 through
an appropriation of the CAVA during the vacation. The
money was wisely distributed among more than .'>oo stu
dents, and various departments and sections of the campus
received some much needed attention.
Hut what a tragedy it is that President Roosevelt has
announced the termination of the CAVA when the work
has hardly begun! On practically every campus in these
United States, educators the men who must carry on
Progress—arc underpaid, some greatly more than others.
Salary slashes have reduced some of their incomes to the
points where high school and grammar school instructors,
who admittedly are not as highly trained, draw larger
checks than do the professors and faculty staff members
in worthy colleges.
Oswald Garrison Villard, writing in a recent issue of
The Nation, hits the nail the hardest when he says:
"A/ least somebody ought to eat I President Roose
velt's attention to the dire distress of so many of our
schools of higher learning, which ought to be the most
cherished institutions in our entire national life. It is
(dl very well to build concrete roads and dams and
j)ut young men into the forests, but it is an infernal
outrage in this national emergency to approve a bill
for the expenditure of $.100,000,000 for warships when
the price of even two battleships expended upon our
universities would bring hope and cheer, yes, decent
sustenance, to students and teachers on a thousand
campuses. Can there be any (juration which expendi
ture would really make for the true preparedness of
this country for the tasks and dangers and infinitely
difficult problems of the future?"
Battleships always make a big hit with crowds when
they have Xavy Days and such. The "oil's and ah's" almost
rock the vessel as some nattily attired officers explain how
"this torpedo can go straight for one mile, then make a
10-degrec turn to the left and sink an enemy boat and
2000 men six miles away." Anything colossal wins public
approval—even all the zeroes in the huge appropriations
for national defense.
The United States government has in recent months put
forth amazingly large sums for the relief of unemployment
and the increasing of purchasing value. Kven though the
speedy circulation of those billions rapidly aids many
people to a small extent, that work has only begun.
Interested parties could join with national organiza
tions' steps and forward demands to Washington that the
CAVA be continued. And you might include in your de
mands some insistent remarks such as those put forth by
Mr. Yillard in his article.
