SPITFIRE (KKO)
I At the Stanford Theatre
j The truth about "Spitfire" is that
! it simply doesn't click. As has been
j the case with former Hepburn pic
' tures, the burden of a very limp opus
1 has been placed entirely upon the
j slender shoulders of the star, and in
! this case Miss Hepburn—in spite of
[ Herculean endeavors—cannot quite
| stand up under it.
Here she is given the doubtful
| role of a Kentucky mountain Saint
Joan (what with voices and visiiu
j tions) who, in the true witch tradi
tion, is misunderstood. The star is
surrounded by unconvincing rural
types and is placed among what must
be ill-smelling cabins. She is forced
to render the stupidest possible re
marks in a spurious way-down-east
accent which is far from convincing.
And yet, with all these obstacles,
Hepburn manages to turn in an al
most convincing performance. This
is largely -because of her very evi
dent sincerity and what appears to
be an intelligent understanding of
the character of Trigger. Her voice
seems to suit the character she cre
ates, and her work is generally well
subdued. <
The fault, then, lies largely with
the director, who has focused his at
tention too exclusively on the star
and on creating a sort of sham rural
ly. Ho has posed Hepburn and sur
rounded her with aery mists and has
detracted from the strength ol her
performance. In many cases, motiva
tion is obscure, and it is slightly dis
concerting to see Hepburn leave one
cabin just after breakfast and return
to her own darkness outside.
The support is largely indifferent,
particularly in the case of Robert
Young, who loafs through what
might have been a good part. In the
namby-pamby role of the hero,
Ralph Bellamy is at least genuine.
But my favorite "was Louis Moran,
who played the wide-eyed and lova
ble Bill. —Chapin
