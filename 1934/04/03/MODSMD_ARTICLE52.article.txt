# Phi Delts, Nevers Paid Visit by Party Burglar
## 
### 
The residence of Ernie Nevers,
backfield coach, and Ihe Phi Delta
Theta house were visited by a "party
burglar" during the holidays.
Nevers reported the theft of a
gold wrist watch, the gift of the Ail-
American Board of Football, and a
small amount of change from the
bedroom of his home, 346 Madrono
Avenue, while guests were being
entertained in another part of the
house. Entrance was gained by re -
moving two screens from a window
in the room.
A tolal of about $50 was gathered
from various rooms in the Phi Doll
house on the same evening while the
brethren were away.

William Wallace Campbell, presi
dent emeritus of the University of
California, believes the entrance re
quirements of American colleges are
too easy.
