# Rogers Charity Starts Kidnap Rumor
## 
### 
A pile of clothing found beside the
railroad tracks and marked with the
r.artie of Bill Rogers, polo-playing
Stanford student and son of humorist
Will Rogers, gave Palo Alto police
several minutes of anxiety last week.
Fearing foul play and with visions
of kidnapping before him, Officer
George Burns was dispatched to
search for the supposeddly missing
student and to discover if he were
still intact.
Easily found, Rogers was surprised
to hear of his "kidnapping". He ex
plained that the clothing, two polo
shirts, two ties, a pair of jeans, and
some woolen socks, had been worn
out so he was donating them to the
Palo Alto shelter. Taking them to
the shelter at 11 p. m. he had found
the place locked, left the clothes out
side the door.
