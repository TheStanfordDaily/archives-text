# Valley Floor Dropping, Tolman Report Reveals
## 
### 
The Santa Clara Valley has been
slipping during the last 22 years. It
dropped 4.1 feet with the maximum
being recorded on the site of the
Hall of Records in San Jose.
Professor C. F. Tolman, member
of the Stanford Geology Department,
commenting on the gelological rec
ords that show the sinking, said that
the movement was probably due to
I the overpumping of water from \in
j dereround streams and the resultant
i compaction of the soil.
