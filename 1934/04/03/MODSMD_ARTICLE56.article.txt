# WHY IT'S NEWS
## Strike Front Quiet 
### Crompton Bangs, Jr 
Although labor troubles have been
pushed off the front {.ages lately,
! this does not mean they are over.
On the contrary, it looks more like
the lull just before the battle. If
there is a fight between labor and
capital, whether it is peaceful or
violent, it will be over the question
of recognizing or not recognizing the
' American Federation of Labor.
This was the point at issue in
the threatened automobile strikes
' of two weeks ago; it is she bone
of contenftoh in the threatened
longshoremen's strike on the Pa
j ciiic Coast. President Roosevelt
personally averted the auto strike
by a compromise plan which
passes the buck to a U.S. appointed
arbitration agency in Detroit; his
telegram to the stevedores' leaders
in California postponed direct ac
tion here.
QUESTION UNSETTLED
In both of these cases, F.R.'s pol
! icy was not to settle the questions
j behind the threat to strike, but to
postpone the strike itself so both
1 sides could talk it over. They are
now talking it over, but there is
practically' no news anywhere of
what they are talking about, or what
I has happened. Which is probably a
bad sign as far as the public is
concerned. But what is the main
question, and how did it come
1 about?
THE PROBLEM
The root of the wave of strikes
lies in Section 7a of the NRA.
This section says that an em
ployer cannot refuse to meet with
the representatives of his em
ployees to talk about wages, hours,
working conditions, etc. It does
NOT say how they should be
chosen, or from whom they should
be chosen. It does NOT say that
workmen must join a union to be
able to bargain with their em
ployers about wages, etc.
Now the A.F. of L. says the NRA
intended that all workers should
belong to one of their unions,
whether it said so specifically or not.
So union organizers went out to
unionize industry on this basis. But
many employers feel that the NRA
intended no such thing; they be
lieve the NRA merely allows labor
to organize, whether it be in an
A.F. of L. union or in a company
union confined to one company.
Besides they see no reason why
outside unions should interfere with
their affairs, nor any reason why
their employees should not form a
company union. These two points
of view came to grips in the auto
mobile industry.
THE RESULT
The A.F. of L. is determined to
unionize the non-union automo
bile industry: the industry is
equally determined that it shall
not do so. If labor wins in (be
end, which is possible, it will be
too strong to go unregulated. So
unions will have to lose the

power- to strike, ant] employers
will have to recognize and deal
with them. This is exactly what
neither side wants, for it means
the loss of their most cherished
liberties. But they can't have
their cake and eat it too.
