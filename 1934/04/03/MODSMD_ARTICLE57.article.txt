## Welded Steel Will Be Used In Frame of Building 
### 
Construction of Lagunita Court,

for the foundations.
The work for this $3G0,0()0 struc

Santa Teresa street a thousand feet
oi main line sower has just been

The frame of the building is to be
(.i' entirely welded .steel construction.
Pressed sti el limbers will take the

i resistant to earthquakes, according
; to Alfred L. Trowbridge, assistant
comptroller.
Lagunita Court will accommodate
i 200 women, who will be sophomores,
juniors, and seniors. It will be com

two front dormitory units which wfll
be flanked by the two end units.
These will all be connected by cor
riodrs. Two dining rooms will be on
the south side of the court and the
kitchens are to be situated at the
rear.
The organization of the dormitory
carries out the plan of Dean Mary
Yost to bring together the small liv
; ing groups v/ithin the large. Each
of the units will have its own recep
tien hall, but the central lobby and
dining rooms will still furnish a
