## Dr. David Gardiner Speaks During Stanford Hour 
### Annalee Whitmore 
Discussing the historical back
ground of Easter and its present day
manifestations, Dr. David Charles
Gardner last night spoke on Stan
ford's regular weekly broadcast at
7:45 over radio station KPO.
The religious festival had its
origin in the pagan celebration in
honor of "Eostre," the goddess of
spring and the dawn. Early Chris
tians appropriated the holiday, con
verting it into a commemoration of
the resurrection of Christ.
Easter Explained
Dr. Gardner explained the mean
ing of the Christian Easter by trac
ing it back 2,000 years to the death
of Jesus.
"To the disciples and friends of
the Master it seemed the tragic end
r.f a lovely life," he stated. "On
Easter morning their sadness turned
to joy when the word passed from
one to another that Christ had risen
from the dead. That startling fact
marked the beginning of a new
faith, a new religion, a new church,
a new civilization."
Espeeially stressed was the fact
that Christianity was not presented
to the Roman world as a scheme of
ethics taught by a great teacher,
cruicified at the hands of Roman
soldiers. The basic fact of apostolic
teaching is a firm belief in a living
deity.
World Suffering
"Just now," he continued, "we
are suffering painfully because too
long the world has been driven by
a passion for material things. We
eounted our eivilization great, not in
terms of art, or spiritual refinement,
but in terms of industrial progress,
financial prosperity, and physical
comfort."
Four concrete points supporting
faith in the survival of personality
were outlined by Dr. Gardner. He
first cited the fact that the idea is
universal; sccond, that it is in
stinctive.
"Third, Buckle, the historian,
found confirmation for the. hope of
immortality in the fact that when
our dear ones die, we do not cease
to love them."
His next argument concluded that
personality, tlie most valuable pos
session of humanity, should not
alone deserve annihilation.
