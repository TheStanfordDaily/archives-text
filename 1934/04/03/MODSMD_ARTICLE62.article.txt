# WARNINGS ISSUED FOLLOWING RECENT CAMPUS ROBBERIES
## Burns Reports Thefts Of Trunks from Cars 
### 
Activities of a campus thief who
specializes in removing trunks from
the back of automobiles last night
caused Officer George Burns to is
sue a warning to all students to re
move their trunks from the cars
immediately on arrival.
The most recent case was that of
a Sequoia Rough who had a trunk
stolen from his rumble seat in front
of Sequoia just before the end of
last quarter.
At the same time Officer Burns
asked that the fraternities watch
their houses for the appearance of
"brothers" from other chapters who
have a second story touch and sus
piciously light fingers.
Through the activities of the
Berkeley police one of the greatest
menaces to campus cars has been
removed. During the time of their
operation this gang took six cars
from this campus and left five. They
were led by a Chinese gangster, and
>pcrat.ed on a state-wide scale.
This gang would take a car, strip
it of good tires and replace them
with old, then take it to the place of
their next operation and abandon it
when they .stole another car.
