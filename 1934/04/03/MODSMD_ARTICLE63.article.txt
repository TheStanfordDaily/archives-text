# Durand Says 500 M.P.H. Present Flying Limit

Under conditions more perfect
than any which exist, the maximum
speed of airplanes as now consti
tuted would be 500 miles per hour,
Dr. W. F. Durand, professor emeritus
of mechanical engineering, told the
Palo Alto Kiwanis Club at its March
13 meeting.
That maximum speed never will
be attained with today's airplanes,
Dr. Durand said, because there never
is a time when all favorable condi
tions exist as a unit.
The highest speeds attained so far,
he said, have been 424 miles an hour
in a seaplane and 300 miles per hour
in a land plane.
Under similar ideal conditions, it
would be possible for an airplane to
rise 55,000 feet, he predicted.
Not until new materials are found
or further knowledge is amassed
which would be revolutionary in ef
fect on aviation will it be possible to
increase those maximum possibili
ties, Dr. Durand said.
