# Indian Championship Hopes Fade as U.S.C. Wins, 3-1
## JIM APPLEBY, SOUTHPAW TROJAN PITCHER, LIMITS CARDS TO 5 HITS, 1 RUN Hits by Hamilton and Mallatratt Pave Way for Lone Stanford Score in Ninth Inning 
### CHUCK CLANCY 
Stanford's hope for a conference crown in the 191)4 baseball race was
sunk to an almost irretrievable depth yesterday when Jim Appleby, biff
Trojan southpaw, held the Indians to five well scattered base bits and one
run to give his team a 15 to 1 victory.
The Cardinal defeat was the fourth straight suffered at the hands of
Southern California and the fifth of the conference season, the Indians

► having dropped a game to California
at Berkeley last Saturday by a 1!» to
7 count.
Appleby was cheated out of a
shlit-out victory when the Cards
scored their only tally of the game
on two hits in the ninth inning. Bob
Hamilton, left fielder, opened the
frame with a fast double* down the
left field line. Captain Dick Miles
and Bobby Grayson, the next two
men up, flew out and Mallatratt
came to the plate to hammer out a
sharp single, driving in the run.

Julie Bescos, of football and bas
ketball fame, opened the scoring for
the Trojans when he crossed the
rubber in the second inning after
hitting a triple to right center field.
The run scored when Ray Forsythe, j
Stanford shortstop, threw wild to 1
first base on Roberts' grounder.
The only earned Trojan run ot the j
game was scored in the fifth inning i

Stanford's hope for a conference crown in the 191)4 baseball race was
sunk to an almost irretrievable depth yesterday when Jim Appleby, biff
Trojan southpaw, held the Indians to five well scattered base bits and one
run to give his team a 15 to 1 victory.
The Cardinal defeat was the fourth straight suffered at the hands of
Southern California and the fifth of the conference season, the Indians

► having dropped a game to California
at Berkeley last Saturday by a 1!» to
7 count.
Appleby was cheated out of a
shlit-out victory when the Cards
scored their only tally of the game
on two hits in the ninth inning. Bob
Hamilton, left fielder, opened the
frame with a fast double* down the
left field line. Captain Dick Miles
and Bobby Grayson, the next two
men up, flew out and Mallatratt
came to the plate to hammer out a
sharp single, driving in the run.
