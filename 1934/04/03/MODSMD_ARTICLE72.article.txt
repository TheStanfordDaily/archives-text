# Baseball Team Suffers Three Losses in South
## 
### 
With hopes fanned high after
opening the conference season with
two wins over St. Mary's, the varsity
baseball team invaded the southland
during the Easter holiday to suffer
three disastrous setbacks at the
hands of University of Southern
California.
The three Stanford defeats wore
all by one-run margins. In the se
ries opener, played on Saturday, the
Indians found themselves at the
.vhort end of a 3 to 2 score after a
heated 12-inning battle. On Mon
day and Tuesday the Troymen took
a pair of 7 to 6 victories and the
series to send the Cards with their
ilushed hopes wending northward.
However, the Stanford batsmen
did not return to the Farm empty
handed, having hammered a highly
touted alumni aggregation into .sub
mission by a 16 to (J count on Wed
nesday.
General loose play and failure to
hit with men on the bases charac
terized the play of the Cardinals
against the Trojans.
