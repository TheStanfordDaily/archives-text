COMING UP
Pounding down, the homestretch
Stanford athletes face their biggest
tests as they return for the final
quarter of Ihe year. Headed by the
Big Meet on Homecoming Day, April
21, followed by the final game of the
Big Series, the Indians' sport sched
ule is a heavy one.
Track and baseball men face their
toughest contests. The tracksters,
after meeting the Bears, travel down
to Los Angeles on May 5 for their
annual meet with U.S.C., as strong as
ever this year despite predictions to
the contrary. Following this, the In
dians will* hop to Philadelphia, if
possible, for the 1.C.4A. meet in May
and return to Los Angeles for the
N.C.A.A. doings in June. While we
are on the subject, orchids to Stan
ford track fans for their support of
the All-University meet at the end of
last quarter which makes the possi
bility of sending a team to the I.C.
4A. a bit stronger.
BATTERS ATTEMPT
COMEBACK
After three last-inning defeats at
the hands of the Trojans in Los An
geles during the vacation, the Stan
lord baseball team started its at- j
tempted comeback yesterday in the j
first of a two-game series against j
U.S.C. which ends today. Four games
are scheduled against California and I
two with St. Mary's.
Tennis men, also hitting a couple
of snags down South, meet the Tro- j
jans, Bruins, and Bears on the local i
courts. Golfers open proceedings for
Homecoming Week when they take j
cm California April 20, while the
gymnasts also tangle with the Bears.
