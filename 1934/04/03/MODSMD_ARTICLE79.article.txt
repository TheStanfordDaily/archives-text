# Indian Alumni Rowers Nose Out U.C. Grads
## 
### 
Former Stanford men, those who
attended school here back when
Roughs were rough and women
loved 'em, scored an upset on the
Oakland estuary March 10 when they
rowed their eight-oared .shell to vic
tory over the University of Califor
nia alumni in a feature event of the
annual Crew Day at U.C.
"Cash" Davis, '17, a resident of
Palo Alto, broke an oar in the open
ing minute of the race, but the Cali
fornia shell stood by until the broken
implement could be replaced. And
then Stanford returned the favor by
nosing out the Berkeley boat by the
scant margin of two feet.
