# Coach Thornhill Prepares for Spring Football Practice
## TURN OUT Of 60 IS EXPECTED AT FIRST SCRIMMAGE Track and Baseball Are Attracting Stars 
### 
Ready to drive some sound foot
ball into a squad of some sixty as
pirants, Coach Tiny Thornhill will
blow his whistle tomorrow after
noon for the opening session of
spring football.
The sixty will expand to more
than eighty with the completion of
the other major spring sports sched
ules. Six or eight of the absentees
are at present wearing baseball
spikes, while practically the whole
tackle department is pushing the
shot for Dink Templeton — namely
Callaway, Reynolds, and Dunn.
Coming up for varsity competi
tion is a sizeable aggregation fo
last yearjs freshmen. The numbers
of the frosh too, however, are slim
in proportion to the true power,
with half' of their number at the
present engaged in track and base
ball.
Coach Thornhill plans to use the
eight-week period for intensive pre
liminary training, so that by the
first of October, with two weeks of
September workouts, the team can
approach midseason form for the
first game. 'The squad will convene
three days a week, and will touch
on practically every department of
the game. Blocking, tackling, run
ning through plays, and the other
essential elements of practice will
be stressed.
In addition to the actual prac
tice workouts, the coaching staff
plans to air the plays and forma
tions to be used in the fall games in
blackboard talks and signal prac
tices, and considerable new strategy
is to be learned for the all-impor
tant conference tilts.
If present plans materialize, a
practice inter-squad scrimmage v/ill
be run off for the eyes of the stu
dent body, probably the afternoon
of April 20.
Some of the men who will prob
ably turn out for the full eight
week period will be Larry Rouble
and Woody Adams, ihe "5 and 10
boys," Johnny Kay Lewis,
Wes Muller, Lyle Smith. Shel Bron
stein, Frank Alustiza, Chuck White,
Ben Palamountciri, Ed Lettunich,
and others turning out as soon as
expedient.
