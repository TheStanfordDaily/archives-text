Baseball and Babe Ruth, those two inseparable companions are back together again. The big attrac
tion of the New York Yankees is brushing up on his stick work and hopes to string along with his team
mates for 100 games or more this season. This picture was made during an exhibition game between
the Yankees and the Boston Braves. The Bambino took a lusty cut at the ball but it resu.tcd in a hig.i foul.
