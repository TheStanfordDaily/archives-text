# VARSITY NETMEN LOSE IN SOUTH
## Conference Matches Lost To U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. 
### 
Playing listless, dull tennis, and i
not making any breaks for
selves, the Stanford Varsity netinen,
on their southern invasion, lost both i
their conference matches, first to 1
U.S.C. and the second to U.C.L.A.,
an inferior team.
Before the Southern California
match, the six men went up against
the Los Angeles Tennis Club, played
well, and gave the club team their
first defeat of the season. However,
the Cards then turned decidedly
stale, and showed not even a flash
of their potentialities in the two
conference matches.
Lee Consistent
Against U.S.C., Sam Lee played |
perhaps the or.ly consistent tennis,
and stroked with his usual accuracy. I
However, he was up against Gene
Mako, one of tennis' rising greats,
and lost in straight sets, 6-3, 6-2, j
in the Jirst singles. Captain Chuek ;
Otis, playing number two man, |
placed Jess Millamn in the tough
spot and proceeded to upset him in
three sets, 5-7, 3-G, 7-5.
Glenn Reed won the only other !
singles duel against Wooledge,
while Law, Clark, and Shwayder ail
were defeated. Law played Custlen,
losing in three sets, 6-1, 3-6, 3-6.
In the doubles, Mako and Cast
len defeated Otis and Lee,.6-1, £-6;
Shwayder and Bogan lost in three
sets to .Johns and Wooledge, while
Heed and Law gained a half point
for the Cards when they won one
oi' the sets played before the match j
was called by darkness. Score:
S.C. tfVa, Stanford 2Va. j
Otis Wins
Against U.C.L.A., again Captain
Otis came through to win his match !
in straight sets against Lawrence ,
Meyers, t>-3, 7-5; Sam Lee, playing
the feature singles, lost out to bril- i
liant Jack Tidball, Intercollegiate j
singles champion, 6-3, 6-3. Again
Law was defeated but this time in j
a hard three-set match by Briggs, l
6-1, 1-6, 6-3; however, Law still |
had not gained back his usual
strokes, and his blasting serves and i
smashes were powerless. j
Reed in the fourth position was |
defeated by Haight, 6-4, 6-4; and j
Shwayder likewise by Church, 6-0, i
6-4. Danny Clark, playing final sin- I
gles, won over Newcomber in three
acts.
In the doubles, although Lee and ;
Otis lost to Tidball and Myers, Lav/
and Reed won their match, as did i
Shwayder and Bogan. Final score: j
U.C.L.A. 5, Stanford 4. The Cardi- '
nal chances of winning the confer- |
ence, or even defeating the southern j
teams in their clash here next week, i
seem very slim. Especially since J

Howard Blot hen, last year's veteran,
j did not register at school yesterday,
( and Glenn Reed may be ineligible.

U.C.L.A. 5, Stanford 4. The Cardi- '
nal chances of winning the confer- |
ence, or even defeating the southern j
teams in their clash here next week, i
seem very slim. Especially since J

Howard Blot hen, last year's veteran,
j did not register at school yesterday,
( and Glenn Reed may be ineligible.
Playing listless, dull tennis, and i
not making any breaks for
selves, the Stanford Varsity netinen,
on their southern invasion, lost both i
their conference matches, first to 1
U.S.C. and the second to U.C.L.A.,
an inferior team.
Before the Southern California
match, the six men went up against
the Los Angeles Tennis Club, played
well, and gave the club team their
first defeat of the season. However,
the Cards then turned decidedly
stale, and showed not even a flash
of their potentialities in the two
conference matches.
Lee Consistent
Against U.S.C., Sam Lee played |
perhaps the or.ly consistent tennis,
and stroked with his usual accuracy. I
However, he was up against Gene
Mako, one of tennis' rising greats,
and lost in straight sets, 6-3, 6-2, j
in the Jirst singles. Captain Chuek ;
Otis, playing number two man, |
placed Jess Millamn in the tough
spot and proceeded to upset him in
three sets, 5-7, 3-G, 7-5.
Glenn Reed won the only other !
singles duel against Wooledge,
while Law, Clark, and Shwayder ail
were defeated. Law played Custlen,
losing in three sets, 6-1, 3-6, 3-6.
In the doubles, Mako and Cast
len defeated Otis and Lee,.6-1, £-6;
Shwayder and Bogan lost in three
sets to .Johns and Wooledge, while
Heed and Law gained a half point
for the Cards when they won one
oi' the sets played before the match j
was called by darkness. Score:
S.C. tfVa, Stanford 2Va. j
Otis Wins
Against U.C.L.A., again Captain
Otis came through to win his match !
in straight sets against Lawrence ,
Meyers, t>-3, 7-5; Sam Lee, playing
the feature singles, lost out to bril- i
liant Jack Tidball, Intercollegiate j
singles champion, 6-3, 6-3. Again
Law was defeated but this time in j
a hard three-set match by Briggs, l
6-1, 1-6, 6-3; however, Law still |
had not gained back his usual
strokes, and his blasting serves and i
smashes were powerless. j
Reed in the fourth position was |
defeated by Haight, 6-4, 6-4; and j
Shwayder likewise by Church, 6-0, i
6-4. Danny Clark, playing final sin- I
gles, won over Newcomber in three
acts.
In the doubles, although Lee and ;
Otis lost to Tidball and Myers, Lav/
and Reed won their match, as did i
Shwayder and Bogan. Final score: j
