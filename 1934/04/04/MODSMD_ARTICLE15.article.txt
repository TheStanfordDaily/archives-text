Sweeping reorganization of the
! Stanford Concert Series was set un
j der way last night when the Ex
j Committee voted unanimously to
; approve a new plan giving music a
! much larger place in student acti
i vities.
One Ihousand dollars was appro
priated to be divided among the four
campus musical organizations, which
will combine to give one concert of
the five which will comprise next
j year's artist .series.
The move for expansion and re
organization came simultaneously
with the announcement that Rosa
Ponselle, soprano scheduled to ap-
I pear as the season's final artist,
i would not come to Stanford. Miss
! Ponselle will not be available on
I that date, Student Manager Lcs Ha
! bles said last night, although at
j tempts were made last week to se
| cure her appearance next Tuesday
I as contemplated.
Barnes Manages
j Managing student musical organi
j zations under the new setup will be
i a manager of music, appointed by
1 the Ex Committee to serve one year
! at a salary of $360. Of this, $250, the
| amount of the present series man-
I ager's salary, will come from the
! series fund, with the other $110 taken
| from money accumulated by the
I four organizations. Norman Barnes
| was appointed to fill the position.
The Glee Club, Symphony Or
j chestra, band, and choir are the four
! groups affected, and with such r her
talent as may be found they will
| combine to give one of the scheduled
j programs.
Hope was expressed by Ex Com-
I mittee members that the appropria
| tion would serve as a stimulus to
ward added interest in music, and
' in addition add to the popularity of
j the Concert Series.
