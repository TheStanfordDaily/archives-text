# Dr. McKenzie To Lecture This Summer
## 
### 
Augmenting Stanford interest in
Pacific Relations and in people and
conditions across the sea, Roderick
D. McKenzie, former head of sociol
ogy at the University of Washington
and active in the Institute of Pa
cific Relations, will instruct at Stan
ford during the coming summer
quarter. The awarding of the FIDAC
medal a short while ago stimulated
Stanford interest in Dr. McKenzie's
field.
Three years ago Dr. McKenzie was
called to Michigan to succeed the
eminent Professor C. H. Cooley.
When at Washington, Professor Mc-
Kenzie took an active part in a sur
vey of race relationships on the Pa
cific, the findings of which were
communicated during a conference
at Stanford in 1925.
Enjoying the Kahn Traveling Fel
lowship, Dr. McKenzie went around
Ihe world to study the problem of
population. Special concentration
was given ihe race problem in the
Orientâ€”in China and Japan.
While on the staff of the Presi
dent's committee on social trends,
Dr. McKenzie issued his well-known
"Metropolitan Community."
"Human Ecology," the topic on
which McKenzie will lecture Stan
ford students during the summer
session, will attempt to cultivate a
{luman point of view in the study of
a community.
