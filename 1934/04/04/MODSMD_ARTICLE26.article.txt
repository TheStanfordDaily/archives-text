# Comedy Lead To Albertson
## Pete Peck, Kay Arthur, Bob Balzer Win Parts

Culminating perhaps the most in
tensive tryout period to be held for
a Dramatic Council production in
recent years, Harold Helvenston
hist night announced the casting of
four prominent campus performers
for roles in Gertrude Tonkonogy's
"Three Cornered Moon."
Jean Albertson, who made so sen
sational a debut in fall quarter's
"Arms and the Man," has been
awarded her second major role of
the yearâ€”the part of the scatter
brained, irresponsible Mrs. Rimple
gar, at once the head and the down
fall of the mad family about whom
the play centers.
Versatile Player
The broad comedy part of the
brainless mother is an entirely new
departure for the versatile Miss Al
bertson, whose dramatic experience
has also included parts in five Sword
and Sandals reading, notably the
lead in "Of Thee I Sing."
Pete Peck, last seen in the lead
ing x*6le in the mystery comedy,
"Hawk Island," will play the roman
tic lead of Dr. Alan Stevens, who
tries to save the Rimplegar family
from the inanities of the mother,
and who very incidentally wins
Elizabeth, the daughter.
Poet in Love -
One of the best roles in the play
is that of Donald, the poet in love
with Elizabeth. The part contains a
fine mingling of sensitivity and com
edy, and .should pi'ovide a fine op
portunity for Robert Balzar, to
whom it has been assigned. Balzar
also appeared in "Hawk Island," as
well as in "An Enemy of the People"
and "The Critic."
Following her splendid work in
last quarter's "Distant Drums," Kay
Arthur will play the very different
part of Jenny, the comic Czchoslo
vakian maid. Though the role is a
relatively small one, it is immensely
funny, and Miss Arthur should make
the most of it.
