# Stanford Clocks Call for Much Checking, Adjusting
## 
### M. Jack Newman 
Stanford clocks get unusual care; |
in fact there is one man on the j
campus whose daily duties include j
checking and adjusting the main
clocks of the campus.
Early every morning he checks ;
each University clock with one mas
ter electric clock which is located in
the Stanford power plant. The tire
house timepiece, the tower clocks on
the Quad and behind the church,
as well as the two in the Library, j
all carry the correct time at 8
o'clock.
Occasionally errors in time come
ihrough the day due to the shake
in the large hands on the outside
dials of the tower clocks. That is
infrequent though.
However, due to play in the
mechanism which holds the hands j

these clocks vary about two minutes
on each side of the hour. When
the hands are going onto the' hour,
the clock will be about one minute
When it passes the hour, the
play in the hands brings the vari
ance to one minute fast. This is
caused by the play in the gears run
ning the clock and the large hands.
None of the outside clocks are
electric at the present time, but
there is work going on to electrify
the tower clock located in back gf
the church. This is the clock which
rings the campus bells.
The piaster clock by which the
larger timepieces are checked every
morning is one of the newer types
of electrics; it has the feature which
will enable it to continue running
during any current interruption.
