# Furlong Tells Of Turkey in Lecture Here
## Europe's Eastern Frontier Now and Before War Are Contrasted 
### Barbara Sweet 
Contrasting the "New Turkey"
with the Turkey of before the war,
Colonel C. Wellington Furlong, ad
venturer, explorer, and author, last
night more than held the interest of
a Tuesday evening Assembly Hall

Witty and alert, Colonel Furlong
introduced his lecture with the
statement that though his subject:
"Turkey: Europe's Last Frontier,"
was the same as the one he dis

Colored Slides
Beginning with a description of
the old Turkey, the speaker illus

people of America, Kemal said he

Americans, view the Turkish people
as they are.

heard.
Besides overthrowing the rule of
the Sultans during the war,
pha Kemal has made other changes i
since that time, chief of which js the I
adoption of a new alphabet. This j
has been one of the greatest factors I
in modernizing Turkey as it has j
eliminated the year and half of study '
formerly necessary to master the j
letters. As a result literacy in that i
country has increased many times I
and made faster progress possible, j
