# DARKNESS ENDS 13-INNING TILT; CARDS TIE TROY
## Six Pitchers Employed in Smoothly Played Contest; Indians Have Hitting Edge; Teams to Play Off Deadlock This Afternoon 
### CHUCK CLANCY 
Darkness last night called a halt U> one of the hottest waged baseball
contests ever played on the Sunken diamond when a hard-hitting and
steady fielding Cardinal baseball team fought a stubborn Trojan foe through
13 fast innings to a 5 to 5 deadlock.
No less than six pitchers were paraded oil and oil' the mound during
the course of the afternoon as the Stanford batters pounded out 17 hits
from the offerings of a trio of Troy hurlers while the visitors pounded the
Card moundsmen for eight safeties.

Campbell Stars
Floyd Campbell, starting his first
Conference game, held the heavy
hitting Trojan batsmen well in check
for seven innings only to display
signs of weakening in this frame
when he passed Julie Bescos, the
first man up, and was nicked for a
long triple by Stewart which ac
counted for the second Trojan run
of the game and left the Cards with
only a one-run margin.
Coach Harry Wolter at this point
injected Dick Armstrong to relieve
Campbell. Armstrong, who was
pitching in his first major contest,
found the going a little heavy in the
eighth frame, allowing two hits
which were turned into a brace of
runs on an error by Mallatratt and
a long sacrifice fly from Bescos' bat.
Heringer Shines
In the ninth Fred Heringer assumed
the hurling duties for Stanford,
pitching exceptionally fine ball by
allowing only two hits during the
five innings that he stayed on the
mound, in spite of the heavy work
out he had gone through the day
before when he worked the entire
game against the Troymen.
Stanford broke into the scoring
column in the second inning, scoring
two runs on four hits. Ray Forsythe,
Card shortstop, opened the inning
by pounding out the hardest hit ball
seen in the Stanford park for some
years. The ball hit at the top of the
mound in left field and bounced over
the fence. Umpire Sweeney disal
lowed a home run, however, ruling
that the ball must clear the wall on
the fly to count as a four-ply swat.
The importance of the ruling was
nullified a moment later when Jim
Massey singled shaply over the sec
ond sack to score Forsythe. Massey
crossed the rubber when Art Hearn
rolled a fast grounder past Dedeaux
for a hit.
The two teams will face each other
again today at 3:15 o'clock on the
Sunken diamond to play off tl\e tie.
Originally the Trojans were sched
uled to journey to Moraga to meet
the St. Mary's varsity, but a shift
was arranged whereby Southern
California will play the Gaels two
games on Thursday at Moraga.

signs of weakening in this frame
when he passed Julie Bescos, the
first man up, and was nicked for a
long triple by Stewart which ac
counted for the second Trojan run
of the game and left the Cards with
only a one-run margin.
Coach Harry Wolter at this point
injected Dick Armstrong to relieve
Campbell. Armstrong, who was
pitching in his first major contest,
found the going a little heavy in the
eighth frame, allowing two hits
which were turned into a brace of
runs on an error by Mallatratt and
a long sacrifice fly from Bescos' bat.
Heringer Shines
In the ninth Fred Heringer assumed
the hurling duties for Stanford,
pitching exceptionally fine ball by
allowing only two hits during the
five innings that he stayed on the
mound, in spite of the heavy work
out he had gone through the day
before when he worked the entire
game against the Troymen.
Stanford broke into the scoring
column in the second inning, scoring
two runs on four hits. Ray Forsythe,
Card shortstop, opened the inning
by pounding out the hardest hit ball
seen in the Stanford park for some
years. The ball hit at the top of the
mound in left field and bounced over
the fence. Umpire Sweeney disal
lowed a home run, however, ruling
that the ball must clear the wall on
the fly to count as a four-ply swat.
The importance of the ruling was
nullified a moment later when Jim
Massey singled shaply over the sec
ond sack to score Forsythe. Massey
crossed the rubber when Art Hearn
rolled a fast grounder past Dedeaux
for a hit.
The two teams will face each other
again today at 3:15 o'clock on the
Sunken diamond to play off tl\e tie.
Originally the Trojans were sched
uled to journey to Moraga to meet
the St. Mary's varsity, but a shift
was arranged whereby Southern
California will play the Gaels two
games on Thursday at Moraga.
Darkness last night called a halt U> one of the hottest waged baseball
contests ever played on the Sunken diamond when a hard-hitting and
steady fielding Cardinal baseball team fought a stubborn Trojan foe through
13 fast innings to a 5 to 5 deadlock.
No less than six pitchers were paraded oil and oil' the mound during
the course of the afternoon as the Stanford batters pounded out 17 hits
from the offerings of a trio of Troy hurlers while the visitors pounded the
Card moundsmen for eight safeties.

Campbell Stars
Floyd Campbell, starting his first
Conference game, held the heavy
hitting Trojan batsmen well in check
for seven innings only to display
signs of weakening in this frame
when he passed Julie Bescos, the
first man up, and was nicked for a
long triple by Stewart which ac
counted for the second Trojan run
of the game and left the Cards with
only a one-run margin.
