# Goodbye, Miss Ponselle!
## 
### 
After having accepted and signed a contract to appear
here this month in what would have been probably the
outstanding feature of a really good Stanford Concert
Series, Miss Rosa Ponselle has decided to stay back in New
York City to sing over the radio and get married.
Goodbye, Miss Ponselle! You may be an important per
sonage on the Metropolitan Opera House stage, but you
are not the type of artist Stanford audiences would thor
oughly enjoy. Nobody here who truly appreciates good
singing could listen to your songs now without sensing a
hollowness in the "notes which ring true." Nobody could
enjoy a person who insults the public.
Your reasons for wanting to stay in the East are not
suflicientlv sound to warrant breaking your contract —par-
ticularly after your name had appeared in advance pub
licity for the Stanford Concert Series and caused a good
many of the season ticket holders to spend their money.
You undoubtedly have harmed the success of the Concert
Series by weakening the good will which has been estab
lished.
I'iitil you realize that the public has spent the thou
sands which have enabled you at your youthful age to
accumulate a sizeable income, you never will be aiv artist
in the true sense of the word.
Goodbye, Miss Ponselle! Stanford audiences no longer
are interested in hearing your far-famed voice. They
prefer listening to a person who enters into contracts in
good faith and who is willing to respond to the public
which has made possible his fame and fortune.
