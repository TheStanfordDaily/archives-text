Ex Committee did a line thing for Stanford cultural
interests hist night when il approved#the proposed 19.11 ,'Ji)
Concert Series and the included student program in the
group of live offerings.
For several years, musical organizations on the campus
have been forced into a rather obscure background while
the Administration concentrated on the development of
other progressive departments of the University. Then,
along came last autumn quarter and the announcement
of a number of new courses in music for the curriculum.
Monday's registration figures show some 70 studentsen
rolled in the newest course added to the list this quarter,
far surpassing the most optimistic predictions.
I'nder the new arrangement, Stanford's glee club, sym
phony orchestra, band, and choir will all benefit and en
ter a combination aiming at mutual self-support. Before
long, an all-student concert here could undoubtedly be
one of the outstanding attractions of the year.
In past seasons the now-decadent Toyon Spring Musi
cale held this spot and presented some really fine campus
talent. Other American universities even today are able
to offer campus artists to appreciative audiences.
Stanford surely must have that talent available today;
il remains but to be brought forth into the open. With
plenty of co-operation, good, determined direction by an
active music manager, Stanford's next Concert Series
should prove a most interesting and profitable adventure.
