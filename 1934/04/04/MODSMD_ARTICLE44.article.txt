Registration dances and all - I'liiversity informals are
nice affairs. The campus enjoys Iheni and wishes that
there were more of them.
Rut along with a dance orchestra brawl and a Masque
Rail coming up, one type of evening entertainment has
been almost forgotten during the the past quarter. What
about the jolly-ups?
Men used to be invited to Kob!e every couple of weeks
when Roblc C.lub played hostess. All-l'nivcrsity jolly-ups
were great sport both before and after games, track
meets, and assemblies where cups or letters were pre
sented.
Jolly-ups haven't been held recently at all. The only
thing that approaches them is the Saturday night Open
House that I'nion C.lub lias for the Roughs.
Jolly-ups have perhaps three good reasons for con
tinued existence (perhaps we sh.ould say revival). First,
they are an integral part in Hie "Rack to the Farm" move
ment which, since its start las! fall, slowly gains ground.
Next, they constitute one of Stanford's most worth
while traditions. Already too few of these remain to be
handed on to future generations of Cardinal sons and
daughters.
And thirdly, perhaps most important, a jolly-up is the
best and quickest method of getting acquainted with peo
ple who don't sit next to you in class.
