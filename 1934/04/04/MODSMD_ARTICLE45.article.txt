AUTUMN CROCM6 (Anthony)
At the Curran Theatre
In the hands' of a Iws skillful
playwright this comedy would have
degenerated into a bad problem
play; with a less talented cast it
would have become a rather point
less vagary. For it has almost no
plot and only one well-drawn char
acter; it Js sometimes comedy, some
times farce, sometimes a problem
Ijlay, and occasionally close to trag
edy. Despite this, the play has a
definite unity of tone, and might be
described as a theme with variations
rather than a play. And in spite of
the fact that nothing happens, the
interest never lags. And granted
that it is a starring vehicle for a
matinee idol, it remains a play that
is both entertaining and sincerely
moving.
The above paragraph is not an at
tempt at paradox, but rather an ef
fort to point out that this is a rare
good example of form that can only
be called "romantic comedy"—how
ever inconsistent the term is.
Set in a small inn in the Tyrol, the
action deals with several groups of
characters which have no external
connection with each other. What
little plot there is deals with the
brief and futile love between the
innkeeper and one of his guests
whom life seems on the point of
passing by. The other characters
are all types, sketched only in out
line, but seen nevertheless to be
completely real. It is not until the
play is over that one realizes that
through these varying types the au
thor has presented varying solutions
to the eternal problem of what to
do about sex. But if she makes a
moral she does not make the mis
take of pointing it.
Francis Lederer's acting, as the
innkeeper, is sincere and direct: he
plays the role for all that it is worth,
but he has so conceived the char
acter that one never feels that he is
guilty of overplaying. It is his re
liance upon direct actions rather
than subtle tricks that makes his
performance so convincing.
Julie Haydon as the forlorn school
teacher succeeds very well in a role
that could be very easily overdone.
Her restraint contrasts perfectly
with Lederer's exuberance. There is
no point in singling out other mem
bers of the cast; they all did ex
tremely well in roles wh ; eh offered
no particular difficulty.
Lederer's direction, like his acting,
was precise, yet sensitive to the
changing moods of the play.
managed to keep thfe complete con
trol of tone that was necessary to
make the play succeed, and kept
the more obvious manipulation of
playwrighting from appearing too
obvious.
To describe fully both the play
and the performance it is almost
necessary to drag in such critical
cant as "charm," "spirit," and so
forth—to characterize an exceeding
ly good play about nothing in par
ticular. —Grant Hopewell

HAROLD KREUTZBERG, Dancer
At (he War Memorial Opera House
A program ot Kreutzberg's might
be disappointing, but it cannot be
poor. In general it. can be fairly said
that several of the dances on dis
play lacked the neatly compact pat
tern dependent on the sure sense of
choreographic plan which has been
hitherto been granted the noted
dancer. This is especially true of the
dance duets, done with Ruth Page.
'Promenade," with both dancers,
seemed too loosely tied, and the first
Bacchanal, though not meaningless,
was unnecessarily tipsy in a struc
tural way, giving more the impres
sion of an artistic hangover than of
an inspired revel. Even some of Mr.
Kreutzberg's solo dances seemed
lather unbuttoned; the Jester's
Dance, for instance, had moments
of lively hither-and-thither that
scattered the design badly.
The most intense dance of the pro

gram was the star's "Pieta," per
formed with calm and supreme pa
thos, and thus more powerful than
the Hangman's Dance, which loses
through being too strenuously im
aginative. The drama in Kreutz
berg's dances is greatly aided by his
facility in facial expression, as in the
■'Till Eulenspeigel," Hungarian Dan
ces, and the comedy Bacchanal.
Miss Page is completely satisfying
both as a partner and as a solo per
former, particularly in her "Figure
in Space." Frederick Wilckens at
the piano is to be lauded not only for
his accompaniment but also for his
creative power that provided com
positions for some of the most im
aginative dances on the program.
But, as always, it is Kreutzberg's
show —Hatch

At the Curran Theatre
In the hands' of a Iws skillful
playwright this comedy would have
degenerated into a bad problem
play; with a less talented cast it
would have become a rather point
less vagary. For it has almost no
plot and only one well-drawn char
acter; it Js sometimes comedy, some
times farce, sometimes a problem
Ijlay, and occasionally close to trag
edy. Despite this, the play has a
definite unity of tone, and might be
described as a theme with variations
rather than a play. And in spite of
the fact that nothing happens, the
interest never lags. And granted
that it is a starring vehicle for a
matinee idol, it remains a play that
is both entertaining and sincerely
moving.
The above paragraph is not an at
tempt at paradox, but rather an ef
fort to point out that this is a rare
good example of form that can only
be called "romantic comedy"—how
ever inconsistent the term is.
Set in a small inn in the Tyrol, the
action deals with several groups of
characters which have no external
connection with each other. What
little plot there is deals with the
brief and futile love between the
innkeeper and one of his guests
whom life seems on the point of
passing by. The other characters
are all types, sketched only in out
line, but seen nevertheless to be
completely real. It is not until the
play is over that one realizes that
through these varying types the au
thor has presented varying solutions
to the eternal problem of what to
do about sex. But if she makes a
moral she does not make the mis
take of pointing it.
Francis Lederer's acting, as the
innkeeper, is sincere and direct: he
plays the role for all that it is worth,
but he has so conceived the char
acter that one never feels that he is
guilty of overplaying. It is his re
liance upon direct actions rather
than subtle tricks that makes his
performance so convincing.
Julie Haydon as the forlorn school
teacher succeeds very well in a role
that could be very easily overdone.
Her restraint contrasts perfectly
with Lederer's exuberance. There is
no point in singling out other mem
bers of the cast; they all did ex
tremely well in roles wh ; eh offered
no particular difficulty.
Lederer's direction, like his acting,
was precise, yet sensitive to the
changing moods of the play.
managed to keep thfe complete con
trol of tone that was necessary to
make the play succeed, and kept
the more obvious manipulation of
playwrighting from appearing too
obvious.
To describe fully both the play
and the performance it is almost
necessary to drag in such critical
cant as "charm," "spirit," and so
forth—to characterize an exceeding
ly good play about nothing in par
ticular. —Grant Hopewell

HAROLD KREUTZBERG, Dancer
At (he War Memorial Opera House
A program ot Kreutzberg's might
be disappointing, but it cannot be
poor. In general it. can be fairly said
that several of the dances on dis
play lacked the neatly compact pat
tern dependent on the sure sense of
choreographic plan which has been
hitherto been granted the noted
dancer. This is especially true of the
dance duets, done with Ruth Page.
'Promenade," with both dancers,
seemed too loosely tied, and the first
Bacchanal, though not meaningless,
was unnecessarily tipsy in a struc
tural way, giving more the impres
sion of an artistic hangover than of
an inspired revel. Even some of Mr.
Kreutzberg's solo dances seemed
lather unbuttoned; the Jester's
Dance, for instance, had moments
of lively hither-and-thither that
scattered the design badly.
The most intense dance of the pro

gram was the star's "Pieta," per
formed with calm and supreme pa
thos, and thus more powerful than
the Hangman's Dance, which loses
through being too strenuously im
aginative. The drama in Kreutz
berg's dances is greatly aided by his
facility in facial expression, as in the
■'Till Eulenspeigel," Hungarian Dan
ces, and the comedy Bacchanal.
Miss Page is completely satisfying
both as a partner and as a solo per
former, particularly in her "Figure
in Space." Frederick Wilckens at

AUTUMN CROCM6 (Anthony)
At the Curran Theatre
In the hands' of a Iws skillful
playwright this comedy would have
degenerated into a bad problem
play; with a less talented cast it
would have become a rather point
less vagary. For it has almost no
plot and only one well-drawn char
acter; it Js sometimes comedy, some
times farce, sometimes a problem
Ijlay, and occasionally close to trag
edy. Despite this, the play has a
definite unity of tone, and might be
described as a theme with variations
rather than a play. And in spite of
the fact that nothing happens, the
interest never lags. And granted
that it is a starring vehicle for a
matinee idol, it remains a play that
is both entertaining and sincerely
moving.
The above paragraph is not an at
tempt at paradox, but rather an ef
fort to point out that this is a rare
good example of form that can only
be called "romantic comedy"—how
ever inconsistent the term is.
Set in a small inn in the Tyrol, the
action deals with several groups of
characters which have no external
connection with each other. What
little plot there is deals with the
brief and futile love between the
innkeeper and one of his guests
whom life seems on the point of
passing by. The other characters
are all types, sketched only in out
line, but seen nevertheless to be
completely real. It is not until the
play is over that one realizes that
through these varying types the au
thor has presented varying solutions
to the eternal problem of what to
do about sex. But if she makes a
moral she does not make the mis
take of pointing it.
Francis Lederer's acting, as the
innkeeper, is sincere and direct: he
plays the role for all that it is worth,
but he has so conceived the char
acter that one never feels that he is
guilty of overplaying. It is his re
liance upon direct actions rather
than subtle tricks that makes his
performance so convincing.
Julie Haydon as the forlorn school
teacher succeeds very well in a role
that could be very easily overdone.
Her restraint contrasts perfectly
with Lederer's exuberance. There is
no point in singling out other mem
bers of the cast; they all did ex
tremely well in roles wh ; eh offered
no particular difficulty.
Lederer's direction, like his acting,
was precise, yet sensitive to the
changing moods of the play.
managed to keep thfe complete con
trol of tone that was necessary to
make the play succeed, and kept
the more obvious manipulation of
playwrighting from appearing too
obvious.
To describe fully both the play
and the performance it is almost
necessary to drag in such critical
cant as "charm," "spirit," and so
forth—to characterize an exceeding
ly good play about nothing in par
ticular. —Grant Hopewell

HAROLD KREUTZBERG, Dancer
At (he War Memorial Opera House
A program ot Kreutzberg's might
be disappointing, but it cannot be
poor. In general it. can be fairly said
that several of the dances on dis
play lacked the neatly compact pat
tern dependent on the sure sense of
choreographic plan which has been
hitherto been granted the noted
dancer. This is especially true of the
dance duets, done with Ruth Page.
'Promenade," with both dancers,
seemed too loosely tied, and the first
Bacchanal, though not meaningless,
was unnecessarily tipsy in a struc
tural way, giving more the impres
sion of an artistic hangover than of
an inspired revel. Even some of Mr.
Kreutzberg's solo dances seemed
lather unbuttoned; the Jester's
Dance, for instance, had moments
of lively hither-and-thither that
scattered the design badly.
The most intense dance of the pro

gram was the star's "Pieta," per
formed with calm and supreme pa
thos, and thus more powerful than
the Hangman's Dance, which loses
through being too strenuously im
aginative. The drama in Kreutz
berg's dances is greatly aided by his
facility in facial expression, as in the
■'Till Eulenspeigel," Hungarian Dan
ces, and the comedy Bacchanal.
Miss Page is completely satisfying
both as a partner and as a solo per
former, particularly in her "Figure
in Space." Frederick Wilckens at
the piano is to be lauded not only for
his accompaniment but also for his
creative power that provided com
positions for some of the most im
aginative dances on the program.
