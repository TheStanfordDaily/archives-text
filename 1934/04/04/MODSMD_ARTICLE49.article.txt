# WHY IT'S NEWS
## Brain Trust Red? 
### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
The best way tc: get most people
"het up" is to advocate revolution
in America. Generally the kind of
revolution does not matter. Conse
quently for the last 15 years com
munism has been the No. 1 U.S.
I boogey-man. When Russia was rec
ognized, many people thought the
Red scare had died u natural death.
! But they were wrong.
Mr. Rand and Dr. Wirt
A few weeks ago, manufacturer
Rand, committee for the nation
member, told a Congressional com
mittee he had heard the Brain Trust
was Red. He said Dr. William A.
i Wirt, school superintendent of Gary,
Indiana, had told him so, so it must
be true. This*was rather startling
; and therefore real news. But what
i is there to the story?
How It Started
Dr. Wirt has lived over a quarter
| century in Gary, steel mill town
I controlled by the U. S. Steel Corpor
; ation. He is a noted educator, has
I sometimes journeyed to Washington
! to advocate cancelling the war debt*,
j to urge the New Deal to print more
! money. On his visit there last sum
mer, he told a friend he wanted to
meet some of the Brain Trust.
To most people, the Brain Trust
is a group of brilliant young radi
; cals who make the wheels of the
New Deal go round. .While they
may be inconspicuous, they have
plenty of power. Many of them art
former pupils of Harvard Law Pro
fessor Frankfurter. Some of them,
such as Tugwell, are very much in
the public eye. Others, such as Lan
dis and Ezekiel are little known
So Dr. Wirt's Washington friend
arranged a party in Virginia so he
could meet the young radicals in the
flesh. Brand new Maryland rye was
served; it was powerful. Members of
ihci Brain Trust were absent, but
nobody noticed it. Dr. Wirt was at
last let into the great secret. Roose
velt was only the Kerensky of this
Revolution. It seems the Stalin was
to be brain-truster Tugwell, who
was eventually to become King Tug
well the First. The educator stayed
around a few days more picking up '
choice bits like this.
What Docs It Mean?
Obviously someone has been pul- j
ling the good doctor's leg. .Like a
great many prominent people, he has
a blind spot—Communism, Revolu
tion. Most observers agree that
F.R. has actually brought about a
revolution—but with the consent of
most of the people, and peacefully
to boot. No doubt some of the Brain
Trust have "radical" ideas, but as
long as violence is not used, there is
nothing to fear in the way of Com
munism, etc.
The President does not seem to
care what happens to the projected
red-baiting investigation so near
home. After all, the whole thing is
the funniest in the New Deal so far.
But it has its serious side. The pub
lic at large, with newspaper help, is
quite willing to be stampeded into
any crazy belief which happens to
suit the fancy of some particular in
terest with an axe to grind. At any j
rate, Dr. Wirt's official story should |
be a choice morsel.

U.C.L.A. women have a Masonic
organization called Areme.
