# Mail Service Curtailed By Economy Program
## 
### 
Duo to the economy program, a
number of mail dispatches have been
curtailed, according to the local post
office department.
The railway mail service has taken
off the train formerly carrying mail
in the evening, and there will be
only northbound dispatch of mail at
5:55 a.m. Sundays hereafter. The
week-day dispatch at 3:45 p.m. will
be discontinued.
Although Sunday distribution of
mail to boxholders has been dis
continued in Palo Alio, this economy
move has not as yet been effected
here, though local post office offi
cials are not certain about continu
ance until they receive further no
! t ices from Washington. *
