# Card Track Men Favored to Trounce Dons Saturday
## WEAK S. F. TEAM CLAIMS SEVERAL INDIVIDUAL STARS Indians Enthusiastic After Victory Over Bruins 
### Jack Drown 
Fresh from an overwhelming vic
lory over U.C.L.A. last week, Stan
ford's track and field artists are at
present working hard in an attempt
to produce even more brilliant per
formances Saturday when Coach
Dink Templeton's boys meet a com
paratively weak San Francisco Uni
versity team on Angell Field.
The Cards should have little diffi
culty in defeating the bay city boys,
who sustained a severe 109 to 22
drubbing at the hands of U.S.C. last
Saturday.
Little Team Strength
Although S.F.U. does not possess
enough team strength to bother the
Indians a great deal, it does have
on its roster several individual stars
who should extend their Card rivals
to the utmost.
Probably the greatest of the visit
ing threats is Bill Alley, elongated
high jumper, who won his event
against the Trojans with an excel
lent leap of 6 feet 4 inches. Stan
ford's Howie Arthur and Lloyd
Schween appear to be considerably
outclassed by the Don ace at pi'es
tnt.
The dashes, featuring the clashes
of two sophomores, Thorns of Stan
ford and Wisler # of S.F.U., should
provide plenty of thrills for the spec
tators. The latter has been credited
with times of 9.8 and 21.6 in the
sprints, and Thorns' mark of 9.9 and
21.7 made last Saturday in the Bruin
meet are near enough to these to
make the races more than interest
ing.
Stith May Press Meier
Charley Stilh of San Francisco
ran a flight ol' low hurdles in 24
seconds last week to beat the Tro
jan timber toppers while Captain
Gus Meier equalled this in winning
the event against U.C.L.A. How
ever, Meier has faster times to his
credit already this season and he
and the sensational sophomore, Sam
Klopstock, should prevent Stith from
being too much in the picture.
One of the greatest thx - eats to the
Indians' peace of mind is a power
fully built fellow who answers to
the name of Schmidt, and who last
week tossed the discus 15l leet to
beat Troy by a considerable mar
gin. The Don's mark is nearly 10
feet farther than that made by Stan
ford's Slinger Dunn in the Bruin
meet when the big fellow had con
siderable difficulty in defeating his
own team mates. Dunn is capable
of 160 feet or hotter, but he has
fhown a tendency lately to rather
consistently foul on his tosses.
A fifth threat among the visitors
is Walts, a quarter-miler. However,
he will need to be in better form
than ever before to lead A1 Black
man, Stanford's rapidly improving
440-yard man, to the tape.
