# BIGGER BALL LOOP NEXT YEAR
## SIDELINE SLANTS 
### 
Interest in college baseball as well
as in the professional game on the
Pacific Coast seems to be on the
upgrade this year despite the fact
that Stanford's squad has not fared
so successfully in league competi
tion to date. As a result of this in
creased interest, it looks as though
the California Intercollegiate Base
ball Association will jump from a
four to a six, or possibly seven club
league next season.
U.C.L.A.. a former member of
ilje association, is almost certain to
return to the fold, it is said. The
Bruins, although they dropped out
last year, continued to equip a
team and played a number of
games in their own locality. This
season they hired a new coach,
Jack Fournier, former Brooklyn
first baseman who resigned as one
of the outstanding hitters in the
â€¢ National League for a number of
>ears, and tentative plans are be
ing made for an ambitious baseball
program at the YYcstwood institu
tion next season.
It is also understood that Santa
Clara, which dropped out at the
same time as did U.C.LA., and
which discontinued baseball com
pletely this year, may see fit to take
up the sport again. The third po
tential member of the association is
Loyola, the little Los Angeles school
which has given the Trojans so much
trouble on the gridiron recently. The
Lions have always had a good ball
club and there is a possibility that
they might try to gain admittance to
the C.1.8A.
