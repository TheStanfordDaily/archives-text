# Flower Paintings Shown At Stanford Art Gallery
## 
### 
Twenty-four decorative flower
paintings by Gertrude J. Barnes are
being exhibited now at the Stanford
Art Gallery. They are water col
ors done on panels in a large scale,
and are artistic rather than botanical
studies.
Miss Barnes is by profession a
miniature portrait artist, but she ex
cels in both large and small designs.
During her art school days she was
advised to work on a large scale to
counteract her natural tendency to
paint everything in miniature, and
lhe flower paintings are results of
this advice.
Miss Barnes, coming to California
from her home in the East, was im
pressed by the exotic and vivid Cal
ifornia flowers, and has made a
number of remarkable studies of
them.
The paintings will be on exhibit
until April 25.
