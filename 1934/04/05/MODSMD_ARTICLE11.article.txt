ments, achievements, and function
ings of Stanford's Department of
History, Professor Edgar E. Robin
son, executive head of the History
Department, last night gave the first
major department talk of the spring
quarter to a group of 78 persons in
the Little Theatre.
"The History Department," stated
Robinson, "is concerned primarily
with training teachers and writers of
history and in preparing its students
for a pleasant, thoughtful, and use
ful life to come."
States Requirements
Professor Robinson, who has been
at Stanford for 23 years, told of his
experiences with history graduates
and how they have expressed their
gratitude for their history training
that was aiding them in journalism,
selling, advertising, law, and many
other vocations.
Briefly summarizing the aptitudes
that history students should possess,
Robinson said: "The student who
does not read easily and with pleas
ure, who does not thrive in writing
themes, who does not turn naturally
to the library, and who does not see
the value in organizing material had
better not major in history."
History Important
"In history, as well as in all de
partments of the Social Science
School, the student has an opportu
nity to take a large number of elec
tive courses. Only 4o units of work
in history are required."
In conclusion Robinson slated thai
a history graduate cannot expect a
very great financial return from his
degree and that knowledge of his
tory is ;i basic knowledge and forms
a foundation for any number of
modern vocations and professions.
