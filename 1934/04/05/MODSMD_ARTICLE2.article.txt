# Spring Slumbers Of Encina Youth Start Roble Fad
## 
### 
A new use has been found for
the two swings which are so
conveniently located at Roble
for the last few minutes before
lockout. Long have they served
valiantly to diffuse soft mur
murs to the open windows and
listening ears of the maidens of
A and B wings.
Rohleites, .tripping daintily
up the front walk, were amazed
and amused Monday to see the
swing on the left more than
filled by a certain young Encina
tennis player who spends his
days around and about the
scene, to say nothing of his eve
nings. He slumbers peacefully
with his mouth open, unmind
ful of the gaping words, and the
noise.
As the sun was gently setting
in the west, the young gentle
man in question sat up with a
start and a yawn and yelled,
"Is it 2 o'clock, yet?"
Other youths wishing to oc
cu p y the afore - mentioned
swings for summer siestas, will
sing at the desk at Roble.
