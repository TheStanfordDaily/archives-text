# Brutes Amuse Brats As Mothers Meet
## 
### 
Little Stanford grammar school
kids and big Alpha Delts teamed up
yesterday when one of the brothers
curiosity overcame him.
While mothers of the Baby Stan
! tordites were in the school attending
j their regular P.T.A. meeting, the
1 children were having the time of
i their lives on the bars and swings
j in the adjoining playground.
Distracted by the noice, one of the
brutes went over to see what all the
commotion was about. Instead of
quieting the youngsters, he joined
their games and finally was enjoying
himself so very much that another
I young man from the Big White
! House came over to play.
They both had a very good time.
