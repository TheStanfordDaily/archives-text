# "For Women Only"
## 
### 
Sonic time ago, yea, not too long ago, «it was said in
some.circles that the Daily was a hit antagonistic in its
attitude toward the administration of the women's athletic
department as he centered in Roble Gymnasium.
Not being overly interested in personalities, the Daily
is still very much engrossed in observing campus life and
can't very well help watching something that goes on right
under its own beagle, so to speak. Bygones are bygones,
and this is 19.'M, but when mistake follows mistake until
it practically amounts to butchery, it is high time that
somebody tellers bloody murder.
Tuesday afternoon was a nice, balmy, pleasant sample
of a fine day to get in three or four hours of stiff practice
for Saturday's conference tennis meeting here with U.S.C.
Captain Chuck Otis and the rest of the squad knew this,
knew further that the workout was muchly needed, and
that the varsity courts couldnT be used because of re-sur
facing work that was being carried on. No place remained
to go, except to try the women's courts over behind beau
tiful Roble Gymnasium, where the (ireat Dane romps at
will.
So they w*ent. They journeyed over to the women's
domain, built with funds supplied by the men's Board of
Athletic Control, and found four courts vacant, waiting to
be played upon. They didn't get far, for officials told them
that this would be impossible, not at all the thing to do
no, the Stanford varsity shouldn't practice on these courts.
A sacrilege. Tsk. Tsk. What did it matter if four courts
iiwrc vacant?
Indignant authorities, astonished at the squad's an
nounced desires to play tennis, revealed that the courts
were "reserved for women" all afternoon, and didn't care
much whether they were actually in use at the time at all.
Permission was even denied to let the men play for twenty
five minutes, but the fellows were told after several at
tempts to reach a "higher authority" that they might return
after ~> o'clock and the sun had gone down and play to
their heart's content.
The Daily smiles a bit to itself, and wonders how long
this excellent eo-operation of the women's gym is going
to continue with the rest of the University and with the
students who have built and are building this University.
The immediate problem of whether Stanford will win
or lose Saturday's matches because of the lack of practice
Tuesday is of small importance beside the more significant
question in hand today.
What's there to do about it? Constructive criticism is
a tine thing, and we'd like very much to find some way to
induce a little "eo" into the operation of the Roble (ivm
nasium.

Sonic time ago, yea, not too long ago, «it was said in
some.circles that the Daily was a hit antagonistic in its
attitude toward the administration of the women's athletic
department as he centered in Roble Gymnasium.
Not being overly interested in personalities, the Daily
is still very much engrossed in observing campus life and
can't very well help watching something that goes on right
under its own beagle, so to speak. Bygones are bygones,
and this is 19.'M, but when mistake follows mistake until
it practically amounts to butchery, it is high time that
somebody tellers bloody murder.
Tuesday afternoon was a nice, balmy, pleasant sample
of a fine day to get in three or four hours of stiff practice
for Saturday's conference tennis meeting here with U.S.C.
Captain Chuck Otis and the rest of the squad knew this,
knew further that the workout was muchly needed, and
that the varsity courts couldnT be used because of re-sur
facing work that was being carried on. No place remained
to go, except to try the women's courts over behind beau
tiful Roble Gymnasium, where the (ireat Dane romps at
will.
So they w*ent. They journeyed over to the women's
domain, built with funds supplied by the men's Board of
Athletic Control, and found four courts vacant, waiting to
be played upon. They didn't get far, for officials told them
that this would be impossible, not at all the thing to do
no, the Stanford varsity shouldn't practice on these courts.
A sacrilege. Tsk. Tsk. What did it matter if four courts
iiwrc vacant?
Indignant authorities, astonished at the squad's an
nounced desires to play tennis, revealed that the courts
were "reserved for women" all afternoon, and didn't care
much whether they were actually in use at the time at all.
Permission was even denied to let the men play for twenty
five minutes, but the fellows were told after several at
tempts to reach a "higher authority" that they might return
after ~> o'clock and the sun had gone down and play to
their heart's content.
The Daily smiles a bit to itself, and wonders how long
this excellent eo-operation of the women's gym is going
to continue with the rest of the University and with the
students who have built and are building this University.
The immediate problem of whether Stanford will win
or lose Saturday's matches because of the lack of practice
Tuesday is of small importance beside the more significant
question in hand today.
What's there to do about it? Constructive criticism is
a tine thing, and we'd like very much to find some way to
induce a little "eo" into the operation of the Roble (ivm
nasium.
