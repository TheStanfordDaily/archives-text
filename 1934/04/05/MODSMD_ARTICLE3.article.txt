# Smith, Benet Given Leads
## 
### Elizabeth Chapin 
Following a hilarious rehearsal
coupled with keenly competitive
reading of the uncast parts, the re
maining roles in next month's "Three
Cornered Moon" were last night
filled by Director Harold Helven
ston.
The role of Elizabeth, only daugh
ter of the madcap Rimplegar family,
will be filled by Shelley Smith in
her first romantic lead, the part
played by Ruth Gordon in the New
York production. Elizabeth is a com
plex character, in decided contrast
to the dramatist Mrs. Clemens which j
Miss Smith interpreted in "Distant I
Drums," as it offers a mixture of I
the subtle, the hysterical, and the I
sensible.
James Benet has his best part to I
date in the character of Kenneth
Rimplegar, the law student with the ]
occasional Harvard accent. He may j
be expected to bring a gusto to this 1
rollicking roles which will be even !
more impressive than his work in
the romantic leads in "Distant
Drums" and "Holiday." Benet is also
remembered for his direction of and
participation in several Sword and j
Sandals readings, notably "Hay Fe- i
ver."
The flighty Brooklyn girl friend j
of Kenneth, Kitty, will be played by |
Harriet Hall in her first Dramatic
Council appearance. Miss Hall, a !
member of Masquers, has appeared
in two readings, and should fill ex
cellently this comedy role.
Neal Berry, after work in "The i
Critic," "Richard II," and "Drama |
Through the Ages," makes his first |
formal appearances as Douglas, the
stage-aspiring son of the family. |
Berry has a unique brand of comedy j
which will add much to the char- ;
acter.
In the remaining roie of Ed, i
youngest son of the family, will be j
Joe Chamberlain, who survived the j
keenest competition of the evening. |
Chamberlin played a similar, though j
less dramatic, role in "Distant ;
Drums."
These players, in addition to those i
named yesterday, complete the cast l
of the Tonkonogy play. Already cast
were Jean Albertson as Mrs. Rimp
legar, Pete Peck as Dr. Stevens, Bob
Balzar as Donald, and Kay Arthur
as Jenny.

One of the duties of the professors
at Rochester University is to chase
cows off the campus.

Following a hilarious rehearsal
coupled with keenly competitive
reading of the uncast parts, the re
maining roles in next month's "Three
Cornered Moon" were last night
filled by Director Harold Helven
ston.
The role of Elizabeth, only daugh
ter of the madcap Rimplegar family,
will be filled by Shelley Smith in
her first romantic lead, the part
played by Ruth Gordon in the New
York production. Elizabeth is a com
plex character, in decided contrast
to the dramatist Mrs. Clemens which j
Miss Smith interpreted in "Distant I
Drums," as it offers a mixture of I
the subtle, the hysterical, and the I
sensible.
James Benet has his best part to I
date in the character of Kenneth
Rimplegar, the law student with the ]
occasional Harvard accent. He may j
be expected to bring a gusto to this 1
rollicking roles which will be even !
more impressive than his work in
the romantic leads in "Distant
Drums" and "Holiday." Benet is also
remembered for his direction of and
participation in several Sword and j
Sandals readings, notably "Hay Fe- i
ver."
The flighty Brooklyn girl friend j
of Kenneth, Kitty, will be played by |
Harriet Hall in her first Dramatic
Council appearance. Miss Hall, a !
member of Masquers, has appeared
in two readings, and should fill ex
cellently this comedy role.
Neal Berry, after work in "The i
Critic," "Richard II," and "Drama |
Through the Ages," makes his first |
formal appearances as Douglas, the
stage-aspiring son of the family. |
