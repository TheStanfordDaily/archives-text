Every day Congress is "becoming
more and more aware that an elec
tion is coming in November. At this
election, all the experiments of the
New Deal on trial.
This simply means that from
now on differences of opinion will
occur between what President
Roosevelt thinks the country
wants and what individual Con
gressmen and Senators think will
get them votes.
These differences are likely to be
frequent, for the President is elected
by the country at large, while each
Representative or Senator must do
the things and vote for the things
which will please and profit the
people of his district or state.
More often than not what
pleases them will he had for the
country as a whole. Every dis
trict would like to have a Veter
ans' Hospital, but it would cost
too much. But that does not keep
every Congressman from trying to
get one. And if he fails to try, he
will not be re-elected.
This year it is unfortunate for the
Congressmen that F.R. is not going
to tour the country or write letters
asking the people to re-elect only
Democrats. Many of the incumbent
Congressmen and not a few Senators
were elected in 1932 because Mr.
Roosevelt was running at the head
of the ticket. Quite a few were
elected, because they were not Re
publicans. Mr. Roosevelt was elec
ted because a majority of the voters
did not want Mr. Hoover, and not j
because F.R. was a Democrat. j
This year things are different.
So all the candidates will have to
go back to standing on their rec
ord in office—and not on the
President's coat-tails. They will
also have to keep an eye on what
the rival candidate will say and
do. For this reason, both houses
of Congress overrode F.ll.'s veto
of increased veteran allowances
and restoration of Federal pay
cuts. After all, the American Le
gion and Federal employees are
two of the mightiest voting groups.
It would be dangerous to offend
them with all of the House and a
third of the Senate up for re
election.
There* is another angle to the vote.
By voting to override F.R.'s veto,
Congressmen can avoid voting for
payment of the bonus—a less popu
lar issue—and still keep in the Le
gion's good graces.
So from now on, F.R.'s hold on
Congress will appear to be slip
ping; Congress will seem rebel
lious. But remember, it's an elec
tion year.
