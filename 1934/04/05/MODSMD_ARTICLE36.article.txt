NO MORE WOMEN (Paramount) f
Al the Stanford Theatre
Victor McLaglen and Edmund [
! Lowe romp through another of their i
dirty-cracking, fistically active pro
ductions. With a minimum of plot'
| and a maximum of low-liie rowdy |
1 dow, the picture proves to be the
j complete antithesis of its title. For
i it fairly swarms with women, noc- 1
j turnally active. Sally Blane (a good j
j girl) s'traightens the boys up for* a \
while, but she finally confesses that
; they ju'f merely "brothers" to her, f
j thus nicely making way for still an
other sequel (darn it! and just when
we thought McLaglen- was going to
j be safely married).

What a picture for the roughs!
They loved it, showing their keen ,
' appreciation by stamping, whistling, j
! hooting, and other mild forms of j
collegiate approbation. The "Cul- i
| tured" Palo Altans were outraged.
| Of course, they had-a right to be,
for after all the picture was per
-1 i'ectly good 1890 "mellerdrammer" (
| with Ma's store being foreclosed, "a
i rich man's son gone wrong but won
! back by love," Chinese smugglers,
I 'n everything.
| The background for all this thril
| ling action was a Louisiana bayou,
j and there were some really good
| shots. But the superimposition, was '
so badly done that one was con
i stantly aware of the artificiality. At 1
1 times it became quite ludicrous, as
when the boat in which the lovers j
j were riding appeared to be whipping
along broadside to the stream.
1 It was disconcerting, too, to hear >
j the double sing just about three sec- j
j onds after Jean Parker's lips had i
j formed the words of the song. Poor i
' Miss Parker (in jeans) was horribly !
out of place on a bayou, after being i
such a lovely princess in "Rasputin
and the Empress."
Ted Healy and Nat Pendleton, as i
j the dumb racketeers, were the re- j
i lieving excuse for seeing the pic
ture. â€”Brill
