# AMELITA GALLI-CURCI
## 
### 
At the Memorial Opera House
A coloratura soprano seems to j
J have a shorter span of useful life j
j than any other type of singer. Miss j
I Galli-Curci, unfortunately, is no ex- ;
1 ception. The audience heard only a j
few notes that might persuade them j
I lhat they were listening to one who j
once ranked as the greatest eolora- j
; tura.
It is easier to talk about the past j
than the present. Galli-Curci had '
I an almost perfect voice, clear, true, j
land capable of the most difficult i
vocal acrobatics without any appar- j
ent effort. In spite of the cold clarity |
of her tones, they did not seem me- j
' chanical, nor did they have that hard >
quality which mars Lily Pons' voice.
Like almost all coloraturas, hervoice j
was never especially »good in the
i middle or lower registers, but had
| an even quality throughout.
Of these qualities, only the ability
I to do vocal acrobatics remains un- j

impaired. Miss Galli-Curci improved
during the program, but even the
Shadow Song from "Dinorah," her
last and most important number,
was not outstanding. She managed
well on the softer passages, but her
voice lost much of its beauty when
ever she sought for volume.
One commendation not to be over
looked is the choice of program.
After the programs containing DO per
cent trash that Schipa and John
Charles Thomas offered San Fran
cisco, hers deserves praise.
