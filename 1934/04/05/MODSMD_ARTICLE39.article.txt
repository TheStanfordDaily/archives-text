STANFORD HOST
AT P.A.A. MEET
Stanford plays host this year ao
the annual P.A.A. track and field
meet scheduled for May 19. The
PAA. is the bay region athletic as
sociation which is the local branch
of the AA.U. and the meet will in
clude athletes from the various col
leges and club teams in this section
of the state as well as a number of
unattached men.
Bccause of the P.A.A.'s affiliation
with the A.A.U. and because of the
attacks leveled at the latter body
for many years and also at the P.
A.A. in several instances by Dink
Templeton, the announcement that
this year's meet would be held here
came as a surprise to many people.
A.A.U. HOLDS
WHIPHAND
Harry Mulcney, Stanford's minor
sports director, has also had several
run-ins with the P.A.A. and at one
time there was talk of the Indians
withdrawing from the organization.
However, out of consideration for
Stanford athletes, (his was never
done.
The A.A.U. the country over and
its various local organizations such
as the P.A.A. holds the whiphand
over amateur athletes because only
through that body can world records
be accepted as it is the only Ameri
can body connected with the Inter
national Athletic Federation. This
is the group which investigates rec
ords and the conditions under which
they were made and designates the
official world's marks.
Had Stanford-withdrawn from the
P.A.A., the result would have been
that no A.A.U. officials could be ob
tained for Stanford meets and that
no world's records set here would
be officially accepted as such. For
instance, John Lyman's new world's
marks in the 8- and 24-pound shot
put events which he set last Satur
day would never come up for official
recognition if Stanford were not a
member of the P.A.A. and A.A.U.
officials had not been on hand.
P.A.A. MEET BIG
COAST TRACK EVENT
Such a monopoly does not seem |
conducive to the best interests of the
sport. Politics aside, however, the j
P.A.A. meet has been one of the i
outstanding events of the track sea
son on the Pacific Coast for many
years.
For the past several seasons it has
been held at Kezar Stadium, but be
fore the bowl's erection the meet was
held at various colleges, Stanford
having played host once previously.
Conditions are not of the best for
track at Kezar with the possibility of
foggy, windy, and cold weather im
minent and this year's meet should
result in better performances than
have been turned in in recent years.
II is also advantageous for the In
dians to have the meet here as it
saves (he expense of sending & team
to tho city, and Stanford athletes
will have a slight edge in being able
to perform on their own soil.

time there was talk of the Indians
withdrawing from the organization.
However, out of consideration for
Stanford athletes, (his was never
done.
The A.A.U. the country over and
its various local organizations such
as the P.A.A. holds the whiphand
over amateur athletes because only
through that body can world records
be accepted as it is the only Ameri
can body connected with the Inter
national Athletic Federation. This
is the group which investigates rec
ords and the conditions under which
they were made and designates the
official world's marks.
Had Stanford-withdrawn from the
P.A.A., the result would have been
that no A.A.U. officials could be ob
tained for Stanford meets and that
no world's records set here would
be officially accepted as such. For
instance, John Lyman's new world's
marks in the 8- and 24-pound shot
put events which he set last Satur
day would never come up for official
recognition if Stanford were not a
member of the P.A.A. and A.A.U.
officials had not been on hand.
P.A.A. MEET BIG
COAST TRACK EVENT
Such a monopoly does not seem |
conducive to the best interests of the
sport. Politics aside, however, the j
P.A.A. meet has been one of the i
outstanding events of the track sea
son on the Pacific Coast for many
years.
For the past several seasons it has
been held at Kezar Stadium, but be
fore the bowl's erection the meet was
held at various colleges, Stanford
having played host once previously.
Conditions are not of the best for
track at Kezar with the possibility of
foggy, windy, and cold weather im
minent and this year's meet should
result in better performances than
have been turned in in recent years.
II is also advantageous for the In
dians to have the meet here as it
saves (he expense of sending & team
to tho city, and Stanford athletes
will have a slight edge in being able
to perform on their own soil.

STANFORD HOST
AT P.A.A. MEET
Stanford plays host this year ao
the annual P.A.A. track and field
meet scheduled for May 19. The
PAA. is the bay region athletic as
sociation which is the local branch
of the AA.U. and the meet will in
clude athletes from the various col
leges and club teams in this section
of the state as well as a number of
unattached men.
Bccause of the P.A.A.'s affiliation
with the A.A.U. and because of the
attacks leveled at the latter body
for many years and also at the P.
A.A. in several instances by Dink
Templeton, the announcement that
this year's meet would be held here
came as a surprise to many people.
A.A.U. HOLDS

Harry Mulcney, Stanford's minor
sports director, has also had several
run-ins with the P.A.A. and at one
time there was talk of the Indians
withdrawing from the organization.
