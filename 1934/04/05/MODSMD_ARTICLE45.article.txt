# THORNHILL BEGINS SPRING FOOTBALL WITH WORKOUT
## 
### 
Director of Football Claude E.
Thornhill gathered his footballers
around him yesterday afternoon on
the practice field for the opening
hour and a half of spring football.
The three score candidates went
through a real workout, with block
ing, tackling, running plays, and line
work run together in fast succession.
The turnout was immediately di
vided into two groups, one of line
men and the other backfield men.
Linemen waged a strenuous battle
against a couple of tackling dum
mies under the eyes of End Coach
Jim Lawson, giving the huskies
plenty of opportunity to taste anew
the feel of bodily contact.
Backs Play Well
Backs paired up, the first running
interference followed by the second
packing the ball, eluding a sus
pended sandbag. Some, like Johnny
Reisner, Joe Vigna, Ray Lewis, and
Lee Irelan showed flashes of poten
tial speed in rambling past the
dummy.
The rest of the afternoon saw tho
backs working at straight and re
verse plays, three groups of them.
Coach Thornhill personally super

vised a backfield compbsed of Frank
Ahisliza and Ray Todd, fullbacks,
and Chuck White, Johnny Reisner,
She) Bronstein, and Grigo Turretto.
Fans Start Predicting
Following their sojourn in the
sawdust pits, the linemen paired up S
on tackling practice, followed by a
"two-on-one" session of blocking
and charging.
Bleacher fans woke up with a loud
yawn yesterday, and predictions for :
the fall campaign seemed to be in !
order. Some rated the team as the
best in the country, while others al
lowed for possible injuries and re
verses, foreseeing a fair season. None
of these dopings can possibly mean 1
a thing, as there is a world of dif
ference between a football team on
paper in April, and that team in the
heat of a fall schedule.
However, the sophomore stars of
last year have one more year's expe
rience and added growth and age,
so optimists have grounds for large
predictions. Grayson, Hamilton, !
Moscrip, Alustiza, Reynolds, Calla
way, Adams, Rouble, Reisner—these '
juniors and more are enough to form
the nucleus of a team that can win
games.

around him yesterday afternoon on
the practice field for the opening
hour and a half of spring football.
The three score candidates went
through a real workout, with block
ing, tackling, running plays, and line
work run together in fast succession.
The turnout was immediately di
vided into two groups, one of line
men and the other backfield men.
Linemen waged a strenuous battle
against a couple of tackling dum
mies under the eyes of End Coach
Jim Lawson, giving the huskies
plenty of opportunity to taste anew
the feel of bodily contact.
Backs Play Well
Backs paired up, the first running
interference followed by the second
packing the ball, eluding a sus
pended sandbag. Some, like Johnny
Reisner, Joe Vigna, Ray Lewis, and
Lee Irelan showed flashes of poten
tial speed in rambling past the
dummy.
The rest of the afternoon saw tho
backs working at straight and re
verse plays, three groups of them.
Coach Thornhill personally super

vised a backfield compbsed of Frank
Ahisliza and Ray Todd, fullbacks,
and Chuck White, Johnny Reisner,
She) Bronstein, and Grigo Turretto.
Fans Start Predicting
Following their sojourn in the
sawdust pits, the linemen paired up S
on tackling practice, followed by a
"two-on-one" session of blocking
and charging.
Bleacher fans woke up with a loud
yawn yesterday, and predictions for :
the fall campaign seemed to be in !
order. Some rated the team as the
best in the country, while others al
lowed for possible injuries and re
verses, foreseeing a fair season. None
of these dopings can possibly mean 1
a thing, as there is a world of dif
ference between a football team on
paper in April, and that team in the
heat of a fall schedule.
However, the sophomore stars of
last year have one more year's expe
rience and added growth and age,
so optimists have grounds for large
predictions. Grayson, Hamilton, !
Moscrip, Alustiza, Reynolds, Calla
way, Adams, Rouble, Reisner—these '
juniors and more are enough to form
the nucleus of a team that can win
games.
