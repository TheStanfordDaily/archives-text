# PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE TIP-OFFS FROM HOOP GAMES IS CONSIDERED
## 
### 
A long contemplated and some
what fundamental change in inter
collegiate basketball, second greatest
campus sport throughout the nation,
may be inaugurated in the Coast
Conference League during the 1934-
35 season, according to a statement
made yesterday by John Bunn, Card
cage mentor.
In an effort to do away with
roughness. Coach "Caddy" Works of
U.C.L.A. is devising a set of rules
whereby the center court tip-off
will be dropped, either entirely or
in pait. Works will then submit his
ideas to Sam Barry, U.S.C. head for
possible revision, who, in turn, will
turn the plans over to "Nibs"' Price
of California, and Bunn.
First pointing out that with lanky
Dave Meek and fiubberlegs Lee
Guttero scheduled to handle the tip
offs for the Bears and the Trojans,
respectively, during the coming sea
son Stanford's chances for the Coast
crown will be aided, not hindered,
by the proposed change. Coach Bunn
stated that he has opposed the drop
ping of the tip-off as taking away a
bit of the color from the hoop sport
which cannot otherwise be replaced.
However, Bunn has agreed to join
the three other Coast coaches and
give the new plan a unanimous and
thorough try during Conference
games next season. The Card coach
proposes to let the public decide yes
or no for the tip-off, perhaps playing
two of each Conference series with
the center jump and two without.
Under the new plan the team

scored upon will put the ball into
play after a goal by tossing the ball
in from the outside, in the method
now used for double dribble, etc.
Whether to do away with the open
ing tip-off. for the first and second
periods and what to do after tech
nical fouls, are two ot many prob
lems that must be fettled before the
new system can be thoroughly in
stalled.
