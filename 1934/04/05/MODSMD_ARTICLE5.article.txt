### 
Campus leaders and representa
tives of all living and eating groups
met last night and were told by
Alumni Secretary Harlow Rothert
that "student co-operation and en
thusiasm are roused to the same
heights as in previous years, this"
year's Alumni Homecoming on April
20 and 21 should be the most suc
cessful in years."
The plans call for a crowded two
days of activities for the 1,500 or
2.000 graduates who are expected to
return. It will be the first time in
three years that this affair has been
held, although previous to that time
it was an annual event.
Rothert explained to the group
selected as a reception committee
by Jerry Trautman, that students
can do a great deal toward making
the grads feel at home, by welcom
ing them, showing them around the
campus, and seeing that none of
their time is wasted.
Included on the program are many
campus activities, such as the water
carnival, masque ball, and California
track meet and baseball game; and
in addition the alumni will hold
many gatherings themselves.
