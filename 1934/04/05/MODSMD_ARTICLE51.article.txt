# CINDERMEN ENTER LAST PRACTICE AS S.F.U. TILT NEARS
## Dons in Better Shape Than Before U.S.C. Meet 
### 
With but one real practice session
| remaining, Coach Dink Templeton's
j Card cindermen are rapidly round
ing into form for their engagement
j Saturday afternoon on Angell Field
with the spikesters from San Fran
. Cisco University.
Coach Charley Hunter, genial Don
mentor, will bring the same team to
the Farm Saturday that competed
against U.S.C. last Saturday, and ac
i cording to reports his boys will be
| in much better condition than they
j were at Los Angeles _ where they
j sustained a 309 to 22 trouncing.
Runners Look Good
In addition to Alley Stith, and
| Schmidt, who took firsts against the
Trojans, Hunter has Wisler and Fe
rarri in the sprints and Walts in the
j half-mile, all capable of winning
i their events against the Indians.
Wisler and Ferrari will both af
j ford Thorns, Stanford sprinter,
plenty of competition in the 100-
I yard dash, but Hunter has an-
I nounced that Wisler will run the
1 440-yard race instead of the 220,
1 thus shouldering the burden of the
j latter race onto Ferrari. This change
! will allow Walts, who has been try
: ing his hand at the quarter, to re
i turn to his first love, the half-mile,
j where he has been clocked in 1:56.
; Burris, the Card's best 880 man, will
1 have to run faster than ever before
| to defeat the Don ace, especially if
' he is in condition.
Nimmo Should Star
The mile run should see a victory
| for the Indians with Chuck Nimmo,
| great sophomore runner, breaking
j the tape far ahead of the field. Nim
i mo has run under 4:25 on several
j occasions this season and in the
; March 10 All-University meet ap
| proached 4:20.
If Art Azevedo, who placed sec
! ond in the Bruin meet, and Dave
! Devlin, who was unable to compete
' last Saturday, are in shape Stanford
I should score at least two places in
j the two-mile run.
Phil Williams, the Card's premier
j broad jumper, ought to take his spe
| cialty without a great deal of trou
! hie, particularly if he equals his last
j week's mark of 22 feet 10 inches.
The problem of assembling a for
midable mile relay team is giving
, Coach Templeton plenty of worry at
j the present time but with such per
j formers as A1 Blackman, Chuck
Nimmo, "Truck" Dillenger, Davis,
i and Burris to choose from, he is
| hopeful of solving the matter.
