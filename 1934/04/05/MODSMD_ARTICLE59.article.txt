the lecture subject for this morning I
by Warren D. Allen, while "National
Traits in Music" will be illustrated
tonight, assisted by Henry Cowell. j
This evening's lecture will be the |
only one open to the general public, j
New students and auditors who are \
interested will find ample room in
the Little Theatre.
