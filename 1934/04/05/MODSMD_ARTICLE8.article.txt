# Stanford's Income Drop Shown in Annual Report
## 
### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
Stanford University is worth 45
million dollars. It is the fifth rich
; est in the U.S. But this does not
mean that everything is rosy. The
current President's Report shows
that the University has come
through one of its worst years, fi
nancially.
It also shows that the bottom
' was reached sometime last spring;
' things are now definitely on the
| upgrade insofar as increased reg
; istrations are concerned. Bui what
about the 45 million dollars?
Money in Quad
Nearly a third of the total wealth
of the University is in the educa
tional plant, such as the Quad and
other buildings. These produce no
income, but plenty of expense. Over
a million and a half is invested in
dormitories, dining halls, and hospi
tals on and off the campus. Last
year, these took in $000,000. showed
a profit of $42,000. The University's
two million and a quarter invest
j ment in real estate produced $74,000
in income. But securities produce by
far the most income.
Roughly 27 million is invested in
bonds, mortgages, stocks. These
i yielded just over $1,200,000 last year,
J which was $50,000 less than the year
j before.
University Investments
The University has 11 million in
j industrial bonds, 8 million each
; in public utilities and railroads;
j oil companies and buildings ac
r count for a million each, while
I street railways, foreign govcrn-

i ment and state and city bonds ac
count for half a million each. The
rest is in mortgages and loans;
about half a million is in stocks.
Most of the bonds are good. For
some time the policy has been to
buy "underlying" issues—those with
1 the best and closest lien on the
property. Thus the University's list
has held up better than most. The
t pidemic of defaults did not miss the
campus, however. At present, over
a million and a half dollars worth of
hands are in default. This means an
annual loss of $85,000 in income to
Stanford.
Valuleless Bonds
Some of these bonds may work
out in the end, but some of them
arc of little value. Examples:
$100,000 of Ivar Krueger's Inter
l national Match; $100.00 Chilean
Government; $(>(>,000 of the bank
rupt Wabash Railway; $100,000 of
the bankrupt Savoy Plaza Hotel
j in New York.
All these defaults have reduced
j the yield from investments from
\ 4.7:1 per cent in 19IU to barely 4
i per cent last year. This has meant
, a total loss of income of nearly
$200,000 in the past three years.
Undoubtedly Stanford will have to
\ take a loss on some of its invest
-1 ments. But it is not as serious as it
i may seem. If prosperity is actually
! around the corner, the University
j sheuld benefit. Remember that most
1 of the investments are in on the
1 ground floor and have first chance
j at any earnings..

All these defaults have reduced
j the yield from investments from
\ 4.7:1 per cent in 19IU to barely 4
i per cent last year. This has meant
, a total loss of income of nearly
$200,000 in the past three years.
Undoubtedly Stanford will have to
\ take a loss on some of its invest
-1 ments. But it is not as serious as it
i may seem. If prosperity is actually

Stanford University is worth 45
million dollars. It is the fifth rich
; est in the U.S. But this does not
mean that everything is rosy. The
current President's Report shows
that the University has come
through one of its worst years, fi
nancially.
It also shows that the bottom
' was reached sometime last spring;
' things are now definitely on the
| upgrade insofar as increased reg
; istrations are concerned. Bui what
about the 45 million dollars?
Money in Quad
Nearly a third of the total wealth
of the University is in the educa
tional plant, such as the Quad and
other buildings. These produce no
income, but plenty of expense. Over
a million and a half is invested in
dormitories, dining halls, and hospi
tals on and off the campus. Last
year, these took in $000,000. showed
a profit of $42,000. The University's
two million and a quarter invest
j ment in real estate produced $74,000
in income. But securities produce by
far the most income.
Roughly 27 million is invested in
bonds, mortgages, stocks. These
i yielded just over $1,200,000 last year,
J which was $50,000 less than the year
j before.
University Investments
The University has 11 million in
j industrial bonds, 8 million each
; in public utilities and railroads;
j oil companies and buildings ac
r count for a million each, while
I street railways, foreign govcrn-

i ment and state and city bonds ac
count for half a million each. The
rest is in mortgages and loans;
about half a million is in stocks.
Most of the bonds are good. For
some time the policy has been to
buy "underlying" issues—those with
1 the best and closest lien on the
property. Thus the University's list
has held up better than most. The
t pidemic of defaults did not miss the
campus, however. At present, over
a million and a half dollars worth of
hands are in default. This means an
annual loss of $85,000 in income to
Stanford.
Valuleless Bonds
Some of these bonds may work
out in the end, but some of them
arc of little value. Examples:
$100,000 of Ivar Krueger's Inter
l national Match; $100.00 Chilean
Government; $(>(>,000 of the bank
rupt Wabash Railway; $100,000 of
the bankrupt Savoy Plaza Hotel
