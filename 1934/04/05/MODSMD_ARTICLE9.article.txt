# Drama Group Seeks Talent
## 
### 
j An attempt to find and assist new
] and untried talent is being made by
] Sword and Sandals, men's honorary
I dramatic organization, this afternoon
j from 2 to 4 o'clock in the Little
Theatre, with tryouts open to all as
t pirants for characters to participate
jin readings to be presented this
quarter.
The organization emphasized the
fact that the tryouts are by no means
confined to the membership of the
' dramatic group as their main pur
' pose is to discover new talent.
In drawing up the list of readings
j to be sponsored by Sword and San
dals during the spring quarter, it
was thought appropriate to include
a lesser-known work of Aiherica's
foremost playwright. The "S.S. Glen
cairn" series has been selected from
O'Neill's plays of the sea and in
! oludcs four one-act plays revolving
j about the same set of characters,
I seamen on the S.S. Glencairn, The
i plays are: "Moon of Carribbees,
| "The Long Voyage Home," "Bound
| East for Cardiff," and "In the Zone."
The plays are all intense, well
j contrived, and sustained melodrama.
J The casts include several character
j parts demanding some ability .it dia
! lect including: Yank, Cocky, Smitly
| the Sweae, a huge Russian, a Scot,
t and a gentleman trying to escape the
I past. The cast also includes several
women.
