Who's going to rule the Masque
Ball?
B;illots for the King Contest went
to press last night with (iO candidates
completing the total list of nomina
tions received. They will be dis
tributed by Rally Committeemen
Monday night at dinner for a cam
pus-wide vote. The contest will be
strictly popular with voters express
ing a first, second, and third choice
for their favorites.
Rumors last night of a write-in
candidacy by a well-known Row
woman were enlarged when the pos
sibility became evident with the
Rally Committee announcement that
space has been left for three write
ins on each ballot.
"Anything Okch!"
Meanwhile, campus residents faced
the prospect of providing them
selves v/ith suitable costumes for the
spring social highlight. "We have
decided that anything is okeh," said
Chairman Stan Beaubaire. "Wear
anything you can find—the funnier,
more original, the better."
It is not necessary to rent cos
tumes, but the Rally Committee is
now dickering with the Coast's out
standing costumers to have a large
• supply of all types of costumes here
for special rental to students at very
low rates. Arrangements will be
completed next week.
Bids for the annual frolic will be
released for public sale in a limited
number at the A.S.S.U. offices Tues
day morning. Because of the usual
demand for the ducats, increased by
the greater number of women here
this year, prospective purchasers are
warned to get their tickets early in
order not to be disappointed.
Limit Sales
Favorable announcement comes
that the floor is to be kept "just
right" without sell'ng too many in
vitations. Therefore, the Rally Com
mittee will positively not be respon
sible if anyone doesn't get a bid.
Orchestra selection has narrowed
down to two prominent aggrega
tions, and it is promised that this
year's Masque Ball will present the
largest group of entertainers in the
history of the colorful costume ball.
