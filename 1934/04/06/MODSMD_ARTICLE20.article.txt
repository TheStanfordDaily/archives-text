# Hitler Refugee Arrives
## 
### RUSSELL PAINE 
That the Hitler movement is act
ing as a hindrance to science in
Germany is the opinion of Dr. Felix
Bloch, "Hitler refugee" and noted
physicist, who has arrived at Stan
ford to serve as associate professor
of physics for a two-years period.
Dr. Bloch, forced to leave Ger
many with the establishment of
Nazi supremacy about a year ago,
went to his home in Zurich. Swit
zerland, where he stayed several
months. He spent some time in
Paris and Holland and in the fall
went to Rome where he was a Fel
low of the Rockefeller Foundation
iiv the Institute di Fisica dell'Uni
versita.
His appointment to Stanford came
while there and was made possible
by the Rockefeller Foundation and
the Emergency Committee in Aid of
Displaced German Scholars.
Having received his Ph.D. degree
at Leipzig in 1 Dr. Bloch has
.served in various institutions of

Europe, teaching physics and doing
research work. These include as
sistantships at Zurich and Leipzig
and fellowships at the Lorentz
Foundation in Utrecht, and in the
Orsted "Foundation in Copenhagen.
Dr. Bloch arrived in New York
two weeks ago and reached Stan
ford Saturday, beginning his pro
fessorial work Monday.
The main difference between
physics work in Germany and the
United States lies in the greater
stressing of theoretical lines in the
former, Bloch explained. The same
difference, he said, can also be noted
between the Courses offered in uni
versities in the two countries. Ex
perimental physics is the more high
ly developed in the United States.
In his work at Stanford Bloch
will conduct advanced mathematical
physics courses. Among these he
intends to give lectures in atomic
physics which he says is his favorite
field.
Dr. Liloch considers (he situation

in Germany a tragic one and says
as a result of this "the people have
become very excited." "The Hitler
movement has been made possible
because of a desire for something
new," he explained.
Two reasons for the stunting of
scientific work in Germany he
names as the action of the govern
ment in forcing a number of scien
tists to leave the country, and the
taking up of so nufch time and
energy of German students with the
Nazi organizations. German sci
ence, however, still stands on a high
level, he maintained. *
Speaking of the physics work at
Stanford, Dr. Bloc!) sajd. "It is es
pecially excellent here."
Dr. Bloch is unmarried. Ht? likes
music, himself playing the piano.
He also said ho likes athletics, al
though not very expert, and plays
tennis a liltle.
He has no plans at present as to
what he will do following his Iwo
year contract at Stanford.

Two reasons for the stunting of
scientific work in Germany he
names as the action of the govern
ment in forcing a number of scien
tists to leave the country, and the
taking up of so nufch time and
energy of German students with the
Nazi organizations. German sci
ence, however, still stands on a high
level, he maintained. *
Speaking of the physics work at
Stanford, Dr. Bloc!) sajd. "It is es
pecially excellent here."
Dr. Bloch is unmarried. Ht? likes
music, himself playing the piano.
He also said ho likes athletics, al
though not very expert, and plays
tennis a liltle.
He has no plans at present as to
what he will do following his Iwo
year contract at Stanford.
That the Hitler movement is act
ing as a hindrance to science in
Germany is the opinion of Dr. Felix
Bloch, "Hitler refugee" and noted
physicist, who has arrived at Stan
ford to serve as associate professor
of physics for a two-years period.
Dr. Bloch, forced to leave Ger
many with the establishment of
Nazi supremacy about a year ago,
went to his home in Zurich. Swit
zerland, where he stayed several
months. He spent some time in
Paris and Holland and in the fall
went to Rome where he was a Fel
low of the Rockefeller Foundation
iiv the Institute di Fisica dell'Uni
versita.
His appointment to Stanford came
while there and was made possible
by the Rockefeller Foundation and
the Emergency Committee in Aid of
Displaced German Scholars.
Having received his Ph.D. degree
at Leipzig in 1 Dr. Bloch has
.served in various institutions of

Europe, teaching physics and doing
research work. These include as
sistantships at Zurich and Leipzig
and fellowships at the Lorentz
Foundation in Utrecht, and in the
Orsted "Foundation in Copenhagen.
Dr. Bloch arrived in New York
two weeks ago and reached Stan
ford Saturday, beginning his pro
fessorial work Monday.
The main difference between
physics work in Germany and the
United States lies in the greater
stressing of theoretical lines in the
former, Bloch explained. The same
difference, he said, can also be noted
between the Courses offered in uni
versities in the two countries. Ex
perimental physics is the more high
ly developed in the United States.
In his work at Stanford Bloch
will conduct advanced mathematical
physics courses. Among these he
intends to give lectures in atomic
physics which he says is his favorite
field.
Dr. Liloch considers (he situation

in Germany a tragic one and says
as a result of this "the people have
become very excited." "The Hitler
movement has been made possible
because of a desire for something
new," he explained.
