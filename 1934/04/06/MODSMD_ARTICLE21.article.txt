# Negro Speaks To Socialists
## 
### 
Bringing a major indictment
against the capitalist system and the
maldistribution of wealth which has
resulted in the breakdown of our
economic system, Frank R. Cross
waith, prominent negro orator, edu
cator, and Socialist Party leader,
spoke last night before a group of
150 at the Native Sons' rfall. Sched
uled to speak on "A Plan for Negro
America," Crosswaith announced
that he would talk on the general
economic economic and social situa
tion existing in America today.
Following in general the tenets of
the socialist program, the speaker
first indicated the fallacies and con
tradictions inherent in the capitalist
system which made our present sit
uation not only possible btu un
avoidable. Declaring that our pres
ent system offered only four meth
ods of sustaining life, namely, work,
ownership, begging, or theft, Cross
waith dismissed the last two meth
ods as impractical because of "over
regulation." Assuming that only
ownership and labor remained,. he
based his asumption of our pi-esent
difficulty on the need of a strong
and marked class division as the
basis of our society.
Class division, said Crosswaith,
implies the profit motive, in the
form of interest, rent and profits to
the.' owning class, wages to the labor
ing class. From this basis has been
created the artificial division of
power which gives to the small mi
nority of the population control, of
the nation's wealth. Carrying his
argument farther, the speaker dis
cussed the results in those indus
tries toward which the government
had assumed a social responsibility,
showing that in them competition
and capitalism had practically dis
appeared, whereas in the vitally im
portant police services, health bu
reaus, and other publicly operated
services, the interest of the majority
was of primary importance.
Bringing his convincing presenta
tion to a close, Crosswaith discussed
the quantity of alphabetical maneu
vering that had occurred in the past
year. Passing off the NRA, CWA,
PWA, and the various national agen
cies which the New Deal has created,
Crosswaith remarked that but one
alphabetical aggregation remained
to solve the problem.
