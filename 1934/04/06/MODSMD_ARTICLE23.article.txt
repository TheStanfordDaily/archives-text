# Jimmy Triolo Puffs Out Plans for Water Show
## Junior Carnival Mogul Airs Aquatic Secrets 
### 
Silver and gold, in various states
of animation, will be both the con
test and the prize of one of the
feature events planned for the an
nual Junior Water Carnival to be
held on April 20.
This much was released from
tight-lipped committee Chairman
Jin; Triolo yesterday, who inscru
tably sipped lemonade while talking
to a representative of the Daily. Just
what secretive, smiling head-yeller
Triolo meant by animated silver and
gold was not explained. But he did
intimate that it was in reference to
a novelty contest entirely different
from anything ever seen at a Stan
tor aquatic show.
Defending Champions
Meanwhile, undazed by this an
nouncement of a new event, defend
ing champion swimmers and would
be swimmers of Alpha Phi and Al
pha Delta Phi went into intensive
training for the 1934 Carnival, where
they hope and expect to defend the
All-University laurels which they
won in 1933. Alpha Phi paddlers, in
particular, began practice with con
fidence, for they can point to the
records which show them sorority
champions of Junior Water Carni
vals since time immemorial, or at
least, time Alpha Phi.
Other living groups and organi
zations, however, maintain that
graduation and overconfidence will
unseat the two champions from their
perilous, watery throne. It is even
rumored that one fraternity is build
ing a swimming pool in the cellar
of its house, where would-be cham
pions will put in tneir hundred laps
a day. (There is no double meaning
to the last sentence.)
Hope for Rain
Though no substantiation of the
whispered rumor has been made,
reports are current that Junior
Water Carnival committee members
are praying for a heavy rainfall
within the next two weeks, so that
Lagunita may be again the scene of
the carnage, but that parallel plans
art being made to hold the meet in
Encina pool, if the present sunshine
continues.
Wiping an involuntary smile from
his lips, Committee Head Triolo
called a Daily reporter back into his
office, just wh'.n it appeared lie was
going to make a successful getaway.
"Wait a minute. Wait a minute,"
he said. "I forgot the prizes. There
will be lots and lots of prizes. The
water will be full of them!" And as
a sly parting shot, Triolo removed
a cigar ($0.05) from his taciturn
mouth, and said: "Don't forget the
animated silver and gold. The lake
will be full of it." Then Triolo pui
the cigar back in his mouth, and the
Daily reporter took this as a sign
that he might leave the office.

Daily reporter took this as a sign
that he might leave the office.
Silver and gold, in various states
of animation, will be both the con
test and the prize of one of the
feature events planned for the an
nual Junior Water Carnival to be
held on April 20.
This much was released from
tight-lipped committee Chairman
Jin; Triolo yesterday, who inscru
tably sipped lemonade while talking
to a representative of the Daily. Just
what secretive, smiling head-yeller
Triolo meant by animated silver and
gold was not explained. But he did
intimate that it was in reference to
a novelty contest entirely different
from anything ever seen at a Stan
tor aquatic show.
Defending Champions
Meanwhile, undazed by this an
nouncement of a new event, defend
ing champion swimmers and would
be swimmers of Alpha Phi and Al
pha Delta Phi went into intensive
training for the 1934 Carnival, where
they hope and expect to defend the
All-University laurels which they
won in 1933. Alpha Phi paddlers, in
particular, began practice with con
fidence, for they can point to the
records which show them sorority
champions of Junior Water Carni
vals since time immemorial, or at
least, time Alpha Phi.
Other living groups and organi
zations, however, maintain that
graduation and overconfidence will
unseat the two champions from their
perilous, watery throne. It is even
rumored that one fraternity is build
ing a swimming pool in the cellar
of its house, where would-be cham
pions will put in tneir hundred laps
a day. (There is no double meaning
to the last sentence.)
Hope for Rain
Though no substantiation of the
whispered rumor has been made,
reports are current that Junior
Water Carnival committee members
are praying for a heavy rainfall
within the next two weeks, so that
Lagunita may be again the scene of
the carnage, but that parallel plans
art being made to hold the meet in
Encina pool, if the present sunshine
continues.
Wiping an involuntary smile from
his lips, Committee Head Triolo
called a Daily reporter back into his
office, just wh'.n it appeared lie was
going to make a successful getaway.
"Wait a minute. Wait a minute,"
he said. "I forgot the prizes. There
will be lots and lots of prizes. The
water will be full of them!" And as
a sly parting shot, Triolo removed
a cigar ($0.05) from his taciturn
mouth, and said: "Don't forget the
animated silver and gold. The lake
will be full of it." Then Triolo pui
the cigar back in his mouth, and the
Daily reporter took this as a sign
that he might leave the office.
