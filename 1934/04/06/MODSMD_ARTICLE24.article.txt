Newspapers can influence their
readers more successfully on mat
ters of abstract truth than on mat
ters of purely local concern, accord
ing to Professor Peter H. Odegard,
political science instructor from the
Ohio State University, who lias
joined the Stanford faculty for
spring and summer quarters. Dr.
Odegard will remain at Stanford
during the absence of Dr. Thomas
Barclay, who is away on sabbatical
leave.
Dr. Odegard has made an inten
sive study of public opinion, and is
dealing with that subject in one of
the courses he is now giving. His
studies in this field have naturally
focussed his attention upon the
newspapers. "The influence of the
daily papers," he says, "is in in
verse ratio to its distance from the
situation under comment."
