# Latest Chapter In Axe History One Saturday
## Fourth Anniversary of Ruse For Return Recalled 
### Irvin Jorgenson 
A legend and a Stanford tradi
tion before present - day under
graduates were born, the Stanford
Axe will finally come to rest Sat
urday in a new specially-built case
that will be placed in the entrance
to the Stanford Cellar.
It is an entirely different axe from
the one that was born thirty-five
years ago as a result of the intense
rivalry between Stanford and Cali
fornia in the annual Big Game,
which was in baseball in those
times. The noble broadaxe with its
10-pound, 15-inch head is now pol
ished, painted, and mounted on a
plaque upon which its history is
told. Its handle was broken in one
of the many fights between Califor
nians and Stanfordites for its pos
session, and the axehead alone re
mains.
Historic April 13
Just as there is a historical co
incidence that all of the major wars
have been started in April, so have
all the conflicts over the axe taken
place in this spring month. It was
on April 13, .1899, that Stanford
traditional history mentions its use
in an axe rally, and it was on April
15, of the same year that Califor
nians stole the axe from a Stanford
yell-leader after Stanford's defeat
in the baseball series.
Exactly four years ago Wednes
day, on April 4, 1930, the gallant
band of 21 Sequoia Roughs wrested
the axe from the hands of Norm
Horner, Cal Axe Custodian, as he
was stepping from an armored car
in front of a Berkeley bank. Using
a fake camera with an ink-bottle
lens and a tear-gas bomb and quick
witted ruses to set Cal pursuers off
the track, Stanford captors sped
down the byways of the Eastbay
region at 80 miles an hour and over
the Dumbarton bridge.
Giant Rally
Their return to the campus was
the signal for a mammoth midnight
rally which started at Sequoia,
continued over to Encina, where
the roughs, swelled by numbers of
the freshmen, went up 1o Roble,
while the nightgowned "500" peered
down from windows and cheered
their "Sir Galahads" returned with
the "Holy Grail."'
Since then the axe has reposed
peacefully for four years in the
musty vaults of a Palo Alto bank.
Last spring, the Ex Committee voted
to offer the axe as a Big Game
trophy. In the fall, this year's Ex
Committee hud the axe taken out
of the vault, polished, painted, and
placed upon the plaque ready to
present to the victor in the Big
Game. With the winning of the Big
Game by Stanford the axe re
mained in Stanford's possession un
prescnted and unsung.
On Saturday, April 7, another
chapter in the axe's history will be
written, when it is placed in the
case, bolted by a steel bar to the
cement floor of the cellar. In event
there ever comes a time when Stan
ford is defeated by California, the
ancient axe will be presented to
California, and the case wHI become
the showing-place of currently in
teresting athletic trophies.
