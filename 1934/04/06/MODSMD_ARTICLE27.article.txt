: shot heaver, has been in great form
all week and has been tossing the
16-pound pellet dangerously close to
the 52-foot mark in practice. The

s;} feet 6 inches in the 16-pound com
petition a couple of weeks ago.
In the javelin, John Mottram,
' greatest spear thrower in Stanford
track and field history, will be in

Deacon Vaults
Bashful Bud Deacon, who vaulted
14 feet 2 : U inches a month ago, to
soar higher than he had ever soared

yard dashes, and also that between

mile, in addition to the above-men
tioned stars, all indications point to
a rather overwhelming victory for
the Indians.

Coach Dink Templeton place in his
boys that he is journeying to Berk
eley tomorrow to obtain some dope
i on the U.S.C. and California teams
when the Trojans and Bears hook
up in their annual dual meet.

way at 2 o'clock tomorrow on Angell Field. Coach Templeton's boys are
slated to win by a top-heavy score in spite of the brilliance of such Don
pi'i'lormers as high juniper Alley, sprinters Wisler and Ferrari, and discus
thrower Schmidt.

The mile run will be the initial
track event, starting at 2:15 o'clock
and followed in rapid succession by
the remainder of the spike competi
tions. Sam Lowry, track manager,
announces that an effort will be
made to run off the meet as quickly
and smoothly as possible in order to
; afford spectators an opportunity to
also attend the baseball game be
tween Stanford and St. Marys on
the Sunken diamond,
Lyman, IVlottram Good
Johnny Lyman, Stanford's greatest
: shot heaver, has been in great form
all week and has been tossing the
16-pound pellet dangerously close to
the 52-foot mark in practice. The
blond Lyman set new world's rec
ords in the 8- and 24-pound events
last Saturday and may attempt to
break the unofficial record set by
Jack Torrance of Louisiana State of
s;} feet 6 inches in the 16-pound com
petition a couple of weeks ago.
In the javelin, John Mottram,
' greatest spear thrower in Stanford
track and field history, will be in
fine shape and should easily place
first in his specialty. Mottram set a
220 feet 10':> inches in the March 10
All-University contest.
Deacon Vaults
Bashful Bud Deacon, who vaulted
14 feet 2 : U inches a month ago, to
soar higher than he had ever soared
before, .should win the pole event in
a breeze.
The greatest duels are expected in
the sprints when Thorns of Stanford
and Wisler and Ferrari of the bay
city boys tangle in the 100- and 220-
yard dashes, and also that between
Joe Burris, the Card's best half
miler, and Walts of the Dons.
Top-lleavy Win
With Nimmo in the mile, Dunn in
the shot and discus, Williams and
Zaches in the broad jump, Captain
Gas Meier and Klopstock in the
hui dies, Blackman in the quai'ter,
and Azevedo and Devlin in the two
mile, in addition to the above-men
tioned stars, all indications point to
a rather overwhelming victory for
the Indians.
In fact, so much confidence does
Coach Dink Templeton place in his
boys that he is journeying to Berk
eley tomorrow to obtain some dope
i on the U.S.C. and California teams
when the Trojans and Bears hook
up in their annual dual meet.
With tlif shot-put iiml javelin listed as the first events, Stanford's track
festival with the University of San Francisco tracksters yets promptly under
way at 2 o'clock tomorrow on Angell Field. Coach Templeton's boys are
