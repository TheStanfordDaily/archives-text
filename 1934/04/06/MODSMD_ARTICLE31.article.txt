Just why there should be a distinction between "major"
and "minor" sports is a question which has long puzzled
the Daily.
Answers have been many hut largely inadequate. It
is argued that football and basketball draw larger crowds
than do fencing and golf. Another idea frequently put
forth is that it costs more to finance a track squad than a
handball team.
But these answers overlook the basic principle of ath
letic awards. Block and cups supposedly arc given for
athletic endeavor. Governing the size of the block, by the
size of the appropriation necessary to maintain the sport,
is inconsistent with the spirit of the award.
•Inst because an athlete's interest happens to be in
sports, termed minor for any one of a number of insufti
cient reasons—it is unfair to him to "brand" him with a
Circle "S" like a dude ranch, meai\while passing out a
Block "S" to his brother who is no more of an athlete, but
whose interest happens to be in a "major" sport.
Men in minor sports have to spend just as much time
becoming proficient enough to represent the University in
intercollegiate maehes as do their fellow-athletes in major
sports. Minor sports training is not a bit less rigorous and
the workouts are just as stiff.
A boxer has to take just as bad and sometimes a worse
heating "for his alma mater" as does a football player.
The only difference is that the boxer takes it in front of a
thousand people and the grid "hero" gets his in front of
1)0,000.
In many cases even this "justification" isn't present.
For instance, soccer and swimming usually draw bigger
crowds than does tennis.
This distinction between sports is not in line with the
spirit of American amateur athletics, the supposed model
of all colleges, which spirit assertedlv works from the basic
proposition of sport for sport's sake.
Differences created between sports, largely on the bases
of appropriations and the size of the crowds, tend to lay
emphasis on gate receipts or costs of the sports.
Why not forget minor and major appropriations and
give the same recognition for the same amount of work,
whether in gymnastics or baseball?
The control of this question is found in the by-laws of
the A.S.S.C. constitution. Those by-laws are now being
revised. Xow is the time for the Ex Committee to remove
or amend an inaccurate, unjust, and misleading classifi
cation.
