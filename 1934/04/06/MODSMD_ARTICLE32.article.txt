Estimates based upon tiie best figures available show
that if a new move lo secure a theatre for Stanford were
instituted every year for 11 1 years, the present Assembly
Hall would eventually weary of criticism tossed at its
palatial interior and simply fold up and blow avvav vol
untarily.
Furthermore, if the Administration should appropriate
ten cents per student each quarter out of the dollar that
is lifted out of the needy scholar's pocketbook to drop at
the I'nion, it would take only 100 years to build a brand
new edifice.
Therefore, if the University should still he here, the
class of 2035 might well appreciate the favor when ground
is broken for Stanford's lirst theatre.
