# Elections Are Coming
## 
### 
Student body politics will ho brewing before lon#
but the next A.S.S.I . eleetion will be one of more funda
mental importance than the naming of officers. Probably
within the next two weeks the campus ill go to the polls
to determine the late of the new constitution.
Al Dcnnev, (Tompton Hangs, Abe MellinkofT, Jeanne
Millard, Jerry Trautman, and Walter Hogart, the latter
now at r.C.L.A., have spent untold hours revising, arguing,
checking, and searching to develop the best possible con
stitution for the Farm. None of the by-Jaws will be voted
upon.
Sometime next week the document will be printed in
its entirety in the Daily. Students would be wise to read
it carefully and reach some definite opinions before they
decide its fate.
