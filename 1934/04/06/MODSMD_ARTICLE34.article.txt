## Governors' Scramble 
### CROMPTON BANGS, JR 
Quite a few people in Califor
nia are on the trail of Sunny Jini
Rolph's job. I.i fact the field is
twice as big as it was a month
ago. The latest of the Governor's
recurring illness has had some
thing to do with it, for he is still a
sick man and certainly no spring
chicken.
What is more important is the
size and importance of the Gov
ernor's job. There is a generous
amount of patronage to be handed
out to the faithful. Under the Rolph
administration this has grown by
leaps and bounds. Besides, the gov
ernorship is a convenient stepping
stone to the U.S. Senate and na
tional political recognition. It is
true that quite a lew of California's
governors did not make the grade,
but the chance is still there.
ENTER C. C. YOUNG
The formal entrance of former
Governor C. C. Young into the race
changes the picture considerably.
He preceded Rolph in office and left
him the 39 million dollar surplus
everybody is looking for now. For
this reason, he is probably the
strongest Republican candidate in
the field—even stronger than Gov
ernor Rolph.
There is also a strong possibility
that onetime Governor Friend
Richardson, Young's predecessor,
will run. He has strong backing
in the south, where they want a
Governor like the very dickens.
Lieutenant Governor F. C. Mer
riam, also from the sunny south,
is still in the race and intends to
stay there; so does State Treas
urer Johnson. State Senator Her
bert Jones is also said to he a
strong possibility.
THE DEMOCRATS
The Democrats should have their
biggest chance of a lifetime this
year. But they have fallen to fight
ing among themselves. Just now
nobody is outstanding. Some of
them are looking for possible issues.
U.S. Attorney Pierson Hall (Los
Angeles) indicted Standard, Shell,
and Associated Oil Companies for
starting a gas price war. On the
strength of this, he apparently in
tends to run. Quasi-Democrat Up
ton Sinclair will run on an anti
monopoly platform. Monroe But
ler, just bounced as state manager
of notoriously inefficient 'Home
Owners' Loan, may enter the race.
The McAdoo faction is supposed to
be backing Hall, though.
YOUNG'S CHANCES FAIR
In spite of everything, ECON
OMY is likely to be the main
issue. Here C. C. Young has a
real talking point; he was an ef
ficient and economical Governor;
and most people are sick of high
taxes plus huge deficits. Many of
the conservative element support
him—which may he against him—
hut California is a conservative
state. The Johnson forces have
not yet placed their money on any
candidate's nose, which means that
they are as yet unwilling to risk
it in the mad scramble for the job.

sick man and certainly no spring
chicken.
What is more important is the
size and importance of the Gov
ernor's job. There is a generous
amount of patronage to be handed
out to the faithful. Under the Rolph
administration this has grown by
leaps and bounds. Besides, the gov
ernorship is a convenient stepping
stone to the U.S. Senate and na
tional political recognition. It is
true that quite a lew of California's
governors did not make the grade,
but the chance is still there.
ENTER C. C. YOUNG
The formal entrance of former
Governor C. C. Young into the race
changes the picture considerably.
He preceded Rolph in office and left
him the 39 million dollar surplus
everybody is looking for now. For
this reason, he is probably the
strongest Republican candidate in
the field—even stronger than Gov
ernor Rolph.
There is also a strong possibility
that onetime Governor Friend
Richardson, Young's predecessor,
will run. He has strong backing
in the south, where they want a
Governor like the very dickens.
Lieutenant Governor F. C. Mer
riam, also from the sunny south,
is still in the race and intends to
stay there; so does State Treas
urer Johnson. State Senator Her
bert Jones is also said to he a
strong possibility.
THE DEMOCRATS
The Democrats should have their
biggest chance of a lifetime this
year. But they have fallen to fight
ing among themselves. Just now
nobody is outstanding. Some of
them are looking for possible issues.
U.S. Attorney Pierson Hall (Los
Angeles) indicted Standard, Shell,
and Associated Oil Companies for
starting a gas price war. On the
strength of this, he apparently in
tends to run. Quasi-Democrat Up
ton Sinclair will run on an anti
monopoly platform. Monroe But
ler, just bounced as state manager
of notoriously inefficient 'Home
Owners' Loan, may enter the race.
The McAdoo faction is supposed to
be backing Hall, though.
YOUNG'S CHANCES FAIR
In spite of everything, ECON
OMY is likely to be the main
issue. Here C. C. Young has a
real talking point; he was an ef
ficient and economical Governor;
and most people are sick of high
taxes plus huge deficits. Many of
the conservative element support
him—which may he against him—
hut California is a conservative
state. The Johnson forces have
not yet placed their money on any
candidate's nose, which means that
they are as yet unwilling to risk
it in the mad scramble for the job.
Quite a few people in Califor
nia are on the trail of Sunny Jini
Rolph's job. I.i fact the field is
twice as big as it was a month
ago. The latest of the Governor's
recurring illness has had some
thing to do with it, for he is still a
sick man and certainly no spring
chicken.
