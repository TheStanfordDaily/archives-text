# BULL SESSION
## FOR SALE: ONE HONOR CODE 
### 
Suspension for four men convicted
of cheating once more focuses at
tention on the Stanford Honor Code,
the little wonder which yet remains
uncodified and unhonored.

To some, the fact that so few have
even come under suspicion is glit
tering evidence that Stanford men
and women are definitely of the
upper 5 per cent, in ethics as well as
intelligence. What is less glittering, :
and still less golden, is the fact that
the convicted four are but the slight- ;
ly inept competitors in a race that I
places a premium on careful, subtle j
cheating. They were not convicted ;
because they stood out as the only
Stanford men who had sinned
against morality, "The Westward ,
Movement," and the grade system.
The quartet is now on the outside
looking in because its particular
brand of cheating was simple, stupid,
artless. The real crime was bad
cheating, not bad ethics.
In the dead center of an economic '
and academic system where cheating
brings results, it is foolish to expect
result-seeking students not to cheat.
StiF more foolish is it to attempt to
turn the first page of examination
blue books into Sunday School ser- '
mons. Real honesty, like real musi- j
cal genius, cannot be taught in "ten
easy lessons."
The present system is one which i
gives the cheatei-s the advantage, i
There are several solutions.
Probably the most, interesting |
would be to declare an open season ;
on grades, with nothing barred, with
ponies, and prepared answers as 1
standard equipment. A simpler sys
tem has been adopted by U.C.L.A. \
and U.C., where honorable conduct
is in the hands of the professor, j
Aside from the fact that the hands ■
of some professors are slightly tinged >
with arthritis, the system is cold, ,
fair, and practical.
Abolition of grades would settle, j

once for all, and rather neatly, the
whole academic mess.

Any one of these methods, we be- :
lieve, is far better than the part- '
fish, part-fowl monstrosity than j
masquerades under the name of
"honor" at the present time. The I
Honor Code continues, uncodified,
\inhonored. —Dave Mellinkoff

To some, the fact that so few have
even come under suspicion is glit
tering evidence that Stanford men
and women are definitely of the
upper 5 per cent, in ethics as well as
intelligence. What is less glittering, :
and still less golden, is the fact that
the convicted four are but the slight- ;
ly inept competitors in a race that I
places a premium on careful, subtle j
cheating. They were not convicted ;
because they stood out as the only
Stanford men who had sinned
against morality, "The Westward ,
Movement," and the grade system.
The quartet is now on the outside
looking in because its particular
brand of cheating was simple, stupid,
artless. The real crime was bad
cheating, not bad ethics.
In the dead center of an economic '
and academic system where cheating
brings results, it is foolish to expect
result-seeking students not to cheat.
StiF more foolish is it to attempt to
turn the first page of examination
blue books into Sunday School ser- '
mons. Real honesty, like real musi- j
cal genius, cannot be taught in "ten
easy lessons."
The present system is one which i
gives the cheatei-s the advantage, i
There are several solutions.
Probably the most, interesting |
would be to declare an open season ;
on grades, with nothing barred, with
ponies, and prepared answers as 1
standard equipment. A simpler sys
tem has been adopted by U.C.L.A. \
and U.C., where honorable conduct
is in the hands of the professor, j
Aside from the fact that the hands ■
of some professors are slightly tinged >
with arthritis, the system is cold, ,
fair, and practical.
Abolition of grades would settle, j

once for all, and rather neatly, the
whole academic mess.

Any one of these methods, we be- :
lieve, is far better than the part- '
fish, part-fowl monstrosity than j
masquerades under the name of
"honor" at the present time. The I
Honor Code continues, uncodified,
\inhonored. —Dave Mellinkoff
