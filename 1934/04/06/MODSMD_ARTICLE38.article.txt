LONDON, April 5 (/P). — Boring
through strata under the Straits of
Gibraltar will not be difficult, ac
cording to engineers who are study-- :
ing the new Gibraltar tunnel project
to connect Europe and Africa. They
say the maximum depth of the sea ;
at the point is not more than 1,000 j
feet, and the shortest possible dis- I
tance between the two shores is J
about six miles.
