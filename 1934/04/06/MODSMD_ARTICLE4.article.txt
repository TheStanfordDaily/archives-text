# Rallymen Decide On Retention of Official Sweaters
## 
### 
Following a prolonged dis
cussion lust night, whether the
Axe symbol and white sweat
ers of the Rally Committee
should be abolished, it was
agreed by the Rallymen that
hereafter not only will the Axe
sweaters be worn at football
games, but also upon the cam
pus, in the same manner as
are "5" sweaters at the pres
ent time.
Ballots for the King voting
were given out to the com
mittee, who will supervise the
balloting next Monday night.
Further plans were made for
the affair itself, it being agreed
that elaborate decorations will
be attempted for the first time
in many years.
Whatever locale is chosen for
the Ball will be completely
covered by construction of an.
entire new interior, as well as a
suspended ceiling.
