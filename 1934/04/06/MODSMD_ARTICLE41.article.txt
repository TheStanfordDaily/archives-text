The Editor, Sir:
Referring to your editorial, "Why !
Stop Now," in today's issue of The
Daily, it is indeed surprising thai
such distinguished editors as those
of '"The Nation" and "The Daily" j
.should commit the all too common j
error of failing to distinguish be- j
tween acts of authorization and of
appropriation. The Congress author
ized the upbuilding of the navy to I
London Treaty strength but thus far
has failed to appropriate one cent
toward that, upbuilding. Therefore j
the $500,000,000 are still available |
(provided that amount can be found j
in the Treasury) for the purposes ,
which you mention in your editor- !
