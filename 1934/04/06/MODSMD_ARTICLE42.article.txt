# WE STILL SAY GOODBYE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Of all the childish, idiotic, vin
dictive attacks written by a second
rate midget against a giant, we think
that your "Goodbye Miss Ponselle"
may well be said to rank with the
best. By what reasoning does the
editor arrive at the surprising con
clusion that Miss Ponselle "will
never be an artist in the true sen.se
of the word" because, as he says, she
does not "realize that the public has
spent thousands which have enabled
her at her early age to accumulate
a sizeable income?"
Is that meant to be a nut-shell
definition of a true artist? Well, a
nut-shell is not very capacious, but
perhaps it is more so than the head
that contained the brain that guided
the hand that placed Ihc last stone
on the monument dedicated to whal
a college education will do to some
people.
Yes, her name has appeared in ad
vanced publicity for the Stanford
Concert Series, and her withdrawal
undoubtedly caused a good deal of
disappointment—but not to the edi
tor, for it provided a singular oppor
tunity for him to unburden himself
of about as bourgeoisie, exaggerated,
and misproportioned a bit of im
becility as may be expected from
one who hasn't had much of a chance
to master the art of asininity due to
iack of time, perhaps.
To the editor a change of plans on
the part of Miss Ponselle is a down
right insult—perhaps a bit personal,
too. Who knows but she aimed it
at our dear editor himself? The
thing to do, of course, is to call the
singer names, attack her artistic
abilities, mention her ethical handi
caps, and finally to leave her to

ignominious and perhaps untimely
death. These furriners, you know—
Oh, Mr. Editor, please stick to
rousing that old spirit, the old zim
boom-bah for the equally old Alma
Matah—the fight to the death, do or
oic spirit—but spare us with your
neat classifications of people who,
to put it mildly, are a bit beyond
your appreciation or misunderstand
ing. Amen.
