# Bailey Writes Article On Alaskan Purchase
## 
### 
A study entitled "Why the United
Stales Purchased Alaska," from the
pen of Dr. Thomas A. Bailey of Stan
ford History Department, appears in
the new issue of the Pacific Histori
cal Review.
Commenting on the traditional
i viewpoint that "the inevitable con
-1 elusion that the chief reason for Ihe
United States buying Alaska was
William H. Seward," Dr. Bailey
states: "The fact is too frequently
overlooked that secretaries of state
do not and cannot buy vast tracts of
foreign territory."
Starting from this position, Dr.
Bailey found 30 reasons why Amer f
ica purchased Alaska, the two chief
ones being: "The American people
bought Alaska primarily because
they thought it was worth the
i money," and al f so because of the
I friendly feeling of the United States
toward Russia at the time."
