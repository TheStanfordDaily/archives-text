AIRLINES—Today sees the open
ing of Jack Benny's new program
under the wing of a new sponsor.
Benny's old sponsor, a prominent
automobile firm, is replacing him
with Victor Young's orchestra. One
of the officers of the firm is an
ardent Wayne King enthusiast and
felt that the company should find an
orchestra which played as nearly
like King's distinctive style as pos
sible. Result—Benny has a new
program at better pay and Victor
Young receives a deserved break.
Sponsor is also being felt by the
Big Show, Monday night feature
which stars Gertrude Neisen. One
of the officers of this company is
somewhat of a playboy and through
his acquaintance with Broadway
clutters up an otherwise good pro
gram with too many mediocre en
tertainers. This method has its good
side, however, when such artists as
Mady Christians and Emile Borio
are brought to the mike for the first
tunc.

Los Angeles, with three straight
wins, heads the Pacific Coast League.
