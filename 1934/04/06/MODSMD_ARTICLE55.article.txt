# Indians Hope for Diamond Comeback in Gael Contest
## BATSMEN; TITLE CHANCES LOST; CLASH WITH WEAK MORAGAN NINE TOMORROW Rally After Disastrous S.C. Series Encourages Card Morale 
### Mort D'Evelyn 
With title chances as good as gone
but with hopes of putting on a
whirlwind finish to a widely her
alded but thusfar spotchy season
Stanford's varsity nine entertains St.
Mary's varsity tomorrow afternoon
in the Sunken diamond following the
Card-Don track meet.
Yesterday the Gaels dropped a
double-header to U.S.C. by scores
of 7 to 5 and 10 to 3, which leaves
the league crown at stake in the
Bear-Trojan tilt on Edwards Field in 1
Berkeley, also tomorrow afternoon. |
Rally Begins
With Bones Hamilton's seventh in- ;
ning home run last Tuesday giving
the Cards their first win over the
Trojans, Coach Harry Wolter's men j
seemed to have started a run of care
ful baseball that should carry them
through the remainder of the season, j
In the 7 to G win the Indians made j
their hits count, contrasting with ■
past games in which the Cards had 1
outhit their opponents but left the
winning runs on the bases.
In the fielding department the
Cards continued to play the splotchy j
game that has characterized their j
previous play, totaling four errors.
With a settled infield the Indians j
jhould take a turn for the better to
morrow.
Galbraith Gets Birth
Eddie Galbraith finally gets first j
crack at the hotly contested center
sack due to his errorless fielding
game Wednesday and his timely
double that drove iu the tying run.
Jim Wooley had the call at the first
of the year, but gave way to Ed
Clarke on the Los Angeles trip, i
Clarke had no sooner got the feel of
the keystone sack when a split fin
ger brought his 1934 season to an
untimely close. But with the start ,
of the spring quarter Wooley, in
stead of going back to his old post,
was lost through ineligibility, and
Bobby Grayson took a turn at un- '
lucky spot.

Galbraith, who did not even make :
the trip South, got his chance when |
Grayson was forced out Tuesday j
with a leg ligament injury and, with j
a fine freshman season behind him i
and an early season injury thor
oughly healed, should greatly j
strengthen the infield.
Mallatratt at Third
At third will be Gordy Mallatratt, j
not fielding smoothly as yet but .
rapidly rounding into condition after '
a severe sickness early in the year .
which forced him off the basketball !
court. Art Hearn, a consistent hit
ter, will again start at first, with i
Hay Forsythe, the spark-plug of the
infield in past games, at short.
Opening in the pitcher's box will
be Stan Anderson, who hurled the
fiiit.l three innings of Wednesday's
game, holding tho Trojans to one hit
and gaining crcdit for tho victory,
despite a sore arm.
St. Mary's Weak
St. Mary's should provide little j
competition, having yet to win a
league game and having been de- ,
feated by the Cards in the two past
games by 918 and 12-2 margins.
Whether the Gaels can produce a
first-class pitcher tomorrow after i
the double-header with the Trojans ■
yesterday is doubted by the fans.

Galbraith, who did not even make :
the trip South, got his chance when |
Grayson was forced out Tuesday j
with a leg ligament injury and, with j
a fine freshman season behind him i
and an early season injury thor
oughly healed, should greatly j
strengthen the infield.
Mallatratt at Third
At third will be Gordy Mallatratt, j
not fielding smoothly as yet but .
rapidly rounding into condition after '
a severe sickness early in the year .
which forced him off the basketball !
court. Art Hearn, a consistent hit
ter, will again start at first, with i
Hay Forsythe, the spark-plug of the
infield in past games, at short.
Opening in the pitcher's box will
be Stan Anderson, who hurled the
fiiit.l three innings of Wednesday's
game, holding tho Trojans to one hit
and gaining crcdit for tho victory,
despite a sore arm.
St. Mary's Weak
St. Mary's should provide little j
competition, having yet to win a
league game and having been de- ,
feated by the Cards in the two past
games by 918 and 12-2 margins.
Whether the Gaels can produce a
first-class pitcher tomorrow after i
the double-header with the Trojans ■
yesterday is doubted by the fans.
Starting line-ups:
Stanford varsity—Hearn, lb; Nut
ting, cf; Hamilton, If; Miles, rf; Gal
braith, 2b; Mallatratt, 3b; Forsythe, '
ss; Massey, c; Anderson, p.
St. Mary's varsity — Harris, ss;
Ewart, cf; Wilson, If; Kane, lb;
Owens, c; Magrini, rf; Hanna, 2b;

With title chances as good as gone
but with hopes of putting on a
whirlwind finish to a widely her
alded but thusfar spotchy season
Stanford's varsity nine entertains St.
Mary's varsity tomorrow afternoon
in the Sunken diamond following the
Card-Don track meet.
Yesterday the Gaels dropped a
double-header to U.S.C. by scores
of 7 to 5 and 10 to 3, which leaves
the league crown at stake in the
Bear-Trojan tilt on Edwards Field in 1
Berkeley, also tomorrow afternoon. |
Rally Begins
With Bones Hamilton's seventh in- ;
ning home run last Tuesday giving
the Cards their first win over the
Trojans, Coach Harry Wolter's men j
seemed to have started a run of care
ful baseball that should carry them
through the remainder of the season, j
In the 7 to G win the Indians made j
their hits count, contrasting with ■
past games in which the Cards had 1
outhit their opponents but left the
winning runs on the bases.
In the fielding department the
Cards continued to play the splotchy j
game that has characterized their j
previous play, totaling four errors.
With a settled infield the Indians j
jhould take a turn for the better to
morrow.
Galbraith Gets Birth
Eddie Galbraith finally gets first j
crack at the hotly contested center
sack due to his errorless fielding
game Wednesday and his timely
double that drove iu the tying run.
Jim Wooley had the call at the first
of the year, but gave way to Ed
Clarke on the Los Angeles trip, i
Clarke had no sooner got the feel of
the keystone sack when a split fin
ger brought his 1934 season to an
untimely close. But with the start ,
of the spring quarter Wooley, in
stead of going back to his old post,
was lost through ineligibility, and
Bobby Grayson took a turn at un- '
lucky spot.
