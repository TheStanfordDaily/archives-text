BIG WEEK-END
IN TRACK
Fairly accurate predictions, at
least as accurate as predict'ons ever
are, will be made following this
week-end's track festivities on the
Stanford oval arid over at Berkeley.
The Indians meet San Francisco
University's Dons while California
and U.S.C. clash across the bay in
iheir annual set-to.
The Bears, having developed from
practically nothing into one of the
most feared squads on the Coast,
should be definitely placed by their
performances tomorrow. The Tro
jans, also, were not counted on sev
eral months ago as having a team
which would come up to their usual
standards. Then sensational per
formances by several of them
boomed Southern California stock
to a high point, but injuries to Nor
man Paul, record-breaking low
hurdler and jumper, and Frank Wil
liamson, great javelin thrower, in
the past few weeks have sent it
down again to the point where Cali
fornia is given an outside chance of
eking out a victory tomorrow.
BEARS MAKE
GREAT IMPROVEMENT
The Bears started out an un
known quantity. "Bullet Bob" Kie
sel, the great but lethargic sprinter
of two years ago who was forced
out of competition last year with a
pulled muscle, was still a problem.
There were no 440-yard men and
most of the other events were in
the hards of inexperienced men or
athletes whose previous records did
not warrant much confidence.
However, Kiesel has shown that
his leg is apparently as strong as
ever and that his temperament has
greatly improved. Leek has come
through in fine style in the quarter
mile while Brace, Hickerson, and
Captain Reynolds give California a
strong trio of hajf-milers. Sopho
more Fowler bids fair to become the
best two-miler on the Coast while
a junior college transfer, Clarke,
has consistently hovered around the
24-foot mark in the broad jump.
COMPARATIVE STRENGTH
OF TROY-INDIANS
The forces of Troy are largely
centered in the track events with
Harper, the weighman; Olson, broad
jumper; and Brannon, high jumper,
the best in the field events. Parsons,
Abbott, and Draper are potentially
great sprinters who have not yet
turned in their best times. The
greatest array of quarter-milers in
the West, McCarthy, Ablowich,
Fitch, and Tomkins, will bring in
plenty of points while Johnson and
Webster, 880; Benevidez, mile, and
Lantz and Winn, two-mile, are out
standing performers.
Comparative strength of Stanford
and the Trojans will be shown when
U.S.F., defeated by U.S.C. 109 to 22
last Saturday, meets the Indians
here tomorrow. The Dons are in
better condition, according to re
ports, than they were a week ago
and will probably furnish a little
more competition against Stanford j
than they did at Los Angeles.
Carl Thorns, A1 Blackman, Gus
Meier, and Sam Klopstock, and
"Birdlegs" Arthur and Lloyd
Scftween will run up against the i
strongest of the visitor's team. Wis- !
ler and Ferrari both have good |
marks in the sprints, and Wisler has J
also turned the 440 in fast time.
Stith, hurdler, accounted for one of
the Dons' three first places against j
U.S.C., and Bill Alley cleared 6 feet;
4 inches in the All-University meet j
here last quarter. —Tremaine |

BIG WEEK-END
IN TRACK
Fairly accurate predictions, at
least as accurate as predict'ons ever
are, will be made following this
week-end's track festivities on the
Stanford oval arid over at Berkeley.
The Indians meet San Francisco
University's Dons while California
and U.S.C. clash across the bay in
iheir annual set-to.
The Bears, having developed from
practically nothing into one of the
most feared squads on the Coast,
should be definitely placed by their
performances tomorrow. The Tro
jans, also, were not counted on sev
eral months ago as having a team
which would come up to their usual
standards. Then sensational per
formances by several of them
boomed Southern California stock
to a high point, but injuries to Nor
man Paul, record-breaking low
hurdler and jumper, and Frank Wil
liamson, great javelin thrower, in
the past few weeks have sent it
down again to the point where Cali
fornia is given an outside chance of
eking out a victory tomorrow.
BEARS MAKE
GREAT IMPROVEMENT
The Bears started out an un
known quantity. "Bullet Bob" Kie
sel, the great but lethargic sprinter
of two years ago who was forced
out of competition last year with a
pulled muscle, was still a problem.
There were no 440-yard men and
most of the other events were in
the hards of inexperienced men or
athletes whose previous records did
not warrant much confidence.
However, Kiesel has shown that
his leg is apparently as strong as
ever and that his temperament has
greatly improved. Leek has come
through in fine style in the quarter
mile while Brace, Hickerson, and
Captain Reynolds give California a
strong trio of hajf-milers. Sopho
more Fowler bids fair to become the
best two-miler on the Coast while
a junior college transfer, Clarke,
has consistently hovered around the
24-foot mark in the broad jump.
COMPARATIVE STRENGTH
OF TROY-INDIANS
The forces of Troy are largely
centered in the track events with
Harper, the weighman; Olson, broad
jumper; and Brannon, high jumper,
the best in the field events. Parsons,
Abbott, and Draper are potentially
great sprinters who have not yet
turned in their best times. The
greatest array of quarter-milers in
the West, McCarthy, Ablowich,
Fitch, and Tomkins, will bring in
plenty of points while Johnson and
Webster, 880; Benevidez, mile, and
Lantz and Winn, two-mile, are out
standing performers.
Comparative strength of Stanford
and the Trojans will be shown when
U.S.F., defeated by U.S.C. 109 to 22
last Saturday, meets the Indians
here tomorrow. The Dons are in
better condition, according to re
ports, than they were a week ago
and will probably furnish a little
more competition against Stanford j
than they did at Los Angeles.
Carl Thorns, A1 Blackman, Gus
Meier, and Sam Klopstock, and
"Birdlegs" Arthur and Lloyd
Scftween will run up against the i
strongest of the visitor's team. Wis- !
ler and Ferrari both have good |
marks in the sprints, and Wisler has J
also turned the 440 in fast time.
Stith, hurdler, accounted for one of
the Dons' three first places against j
U.S.C., and Bill Alley cleared 6 feet;
4 inches in the All-University meet j
here last quarter. —Tremaine |
