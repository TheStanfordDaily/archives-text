## 
### Jack Newman 
With the departure of Lawson Lit
tle l^n - the Walker Cup matches to
be held in St. Andrews, England,
the number one position of the Stan
ford varsity golf team has fallen to
Jack Hoerner, who will attempt to
hold it during the spring quarter.
Already questioning the ability of
Hoerner to hold the position is Don
Edwards, who, though he has been
defeated numerous times in local
tournaments by Ernie Pieper, thinks
(hat h'j will take Hoerner's measure
when they play the fir.vt varsity
challenge match of the quarter this
afternoon.
It is hard to say wnich one will
enjoy the margin in the match as
they are both playing flawless golf
when the present poor condition of
the green is considered. Hoerner in
two games during vacation had a
pair of 72's over the Stanford course.
Edwards has kept himself in shape
by playing in San Jose during the
layoff from school.
The opening gun of the frosh com
petition was fired yesterday when
Bob Welch defeated George Eerkey
for the fifth position on the frosh,
the tight match being decided on the
17th hole by the margin of 3 and 1.
This makes the fifth consecutive
ladder match that Berkey has
dropped. At the middle of last quar
ter he was playing the freshman
number 1 position but has dropped
to the number 6 with yesterday's
defeat. Welch has now challenged
Howard Clark in number 4.
