# Indian, Troy netmen Meet
## 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at 2 o'clock
Stanford's much beleagured varsity
tennis squad comes up against S.C.
for the second time in two weeks.
According to all the dope of old
man Statistics, the Card netmen have
very small chance of winning their
match, and remaining in the run
ning for the '34 conference net
crown. Not only have they lost to
both U.S.C. and U.C.L.A., but ineli
gibility has robbed them of one of
their strongest men, Glenn Reed,
playing very consistently at the
number four key position.
Reed Ineligible
For the simple reason that Reed
has outlived his years of service on
the team, Captain Otis' squad will
be minus the services of one of the
most consistent players on the team
in recent years. Reed got the repu
tation of "marathon" player after
his victories this season, in which he
has played to the limit of three sets
in almost every match, and, inci
dentally, has won almost every
match in which he engaged.
Most exciting of all the matches
will be the number one singles.
Whether Gene Mako, sensational S.C.
netman, will play against Capt. Otis
or against Sam Lee will be found
out today when the two tangle in
a friendly match on the courts to
see who will have the honor of
trying to upset the huge Los An
geles junior.
Courts Resurfaced
The varsity courts have under
gone a resurfacing process the last
two weeks and are entirely in per
fect condition for net play. They
are slightly slower than those upon
which the Stanford team had to
match strokes last vacation, and this
slowing down of the shots may pos
sibly give the Indians a chance. In
fact, although it is entirely pos
sible that S.C. may win, eight
matches to one, there is also the ex
citing possibility that if the Cards
come through and play their best
tennis, they may emerge victorious
by a score of five matches to four.
At any rate, the matches will be
entirely worth whils, with Browne,
Mako, Millmanr., Castlen, and three
other Trojans furnishing opposition.
