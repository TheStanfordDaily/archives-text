# U.C. NINE FAVORED TO WHIP IMPROVED INDIAN FRESHMEN
## 
### 
After showing a marked improve
ment during the past week, Coach
Ernie Nevers' Stanford freshman
baseball players are winding up
their practice today for the first
encounter of the California series,
to take place tomorrow afternoon in
Berkeley.
Nevers was greatly cheered by the
showing of the yearlings in last
night's practice. However, he is not
too opiimistic over his team's
chances of toppling tho powerful
Bear frosh nine, especially in the
first game.
Frosh Handicapped
Finals last quarter and vacation
cut two weeks from Stanford's
practice, and the Babes are just be
ginning to get back into form.
Nevers indicated that he probably
will use Lanson Davis in the box
at the outset of the game. The Card
yearlings have given Davis more
support than they have offered the
other moundsmen, and he has
shown good control in past games.
Teaming with him at the catching
position will be either Mike Ferro
or Louis Tsoutsouvas. They have
been alternating during the season,
with Ferro usually catching Davis.
Infield Named
The infield will include George
Ferris at first base, Web Jones at
second, Howell Turner at third, and
Archer Zamloch at short.
Walt Chouteau will work in left
field, A1 Brent will roam the center
gardens, and right field proably will
be held down by Horace Blackman.
