# VARSITY, FROSH GYMNASTIC TEAMS WILL FACE CALIFORNIA HERE TOMORROW NIGHT
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity and frosh gym
nastics teams will face the Califor
nia Bears in the Encina gym to
morrow night at 8 o'clock in the
only intercollegiate meet of the sea
son for both teams. The Cards'
arch rivals from Berkeley repre
sent an entirely unknown quantity,
but both clashes can be regarded as
toss-ups from what is known of
past teams.
Coach Myron Sprague and his as
sistant, Darwin Peavy, former pro
fessional acrobat, have developed
some high-class tumblers and ap
paratus performers to meet the
Bears tomorrow night. The varsity
will include Harry Baskerville on
the horizontal bars and rings, Frank
Capers on the parallel bars, Jack
Freeman on the horizontal bars,
Julian Lesser, performing with the
Indian clubs, Walter McNiel in the
rings and long horse events, and

! Bob Dearborn, also competing with
! the Indian clubs. Captain Wid Cof
' fin's weak knee will probably not
I allow him to compete.
Perhaps the outstanding vai'sity
men, However, are Tom Kinney,
| who may enter the all-around gym
i nasties competition, and Milt
Friedman, a good tumbler. There
i are rumors of a star tumbler at
California; so this event should be
I hotly contested and interesting to
I watch.
Howard Bonsall in the parallel
I bars event, and Balie Gross, who
| will enter the tumbling, ai'e the
two stars of the yearling squad.
! Victor Cruz in the long horse com
petition and the double tumbling,
| and Bruce Brown in the latter acro
batic performance and the other
| frosh who will meet their Cali
j fornia rivals. With both teams anx-
I ious for a perfect season record,
' the meeting should be close.
