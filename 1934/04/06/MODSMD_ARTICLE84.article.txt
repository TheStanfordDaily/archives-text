NEW YORK, April 5 (A J ). â€”A good j
will gift of considerable intrinsic j
value to the "enemy 11 came with |
Cambridge's Rugby team when it
arrived yesterday for a ten-day visit 1
which includes games with Harvard, :
Princeton, Yale, and a picked All- i
East team. It was four new Rugby j
balls, the gift of the English Rugby j
Union.
When preparations were being j
made lor the visit it was discovered
that rugby balls were very scarce
and that only one new one was ;
available in New York, so a cable
was sent asking that some be j
brought. The English players de
cided to offer them as a gift.
