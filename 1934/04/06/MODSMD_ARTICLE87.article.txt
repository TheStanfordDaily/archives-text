Palo Alto police force proven its
incorruptibility. No Lincoln is too
fine, no scooter too poor for its at
tention, as Jim Dillon, frosh basket -
baller, has found to his sorrow. Last
night night Jim, pedaling merrily
merrily across the tracks into Paly,
pressed close to the sidewalk to
pass a decrepit Ford in front of

following close behind. But the
watchful officers had seen him, and
sounding the siren, drew up and
forced him to dismount. Meekly ac

Jim found himself charged not only
with passing on the wrong side, but
also with speeding and driving with
out lights. He will appear in court
