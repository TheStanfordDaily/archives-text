## 
### 
David Sinclair, 32-year-old son of
Upton Sinclair, California Socialist
and candidate for Democratic nomi
nation for governor, has declared
his father's defection from Socialist
ranks to be "definitely annoying,
and not anything less than that."
Upton Sinclair, it will be remem
bered, spoke here during fall quar
ter. For many years an active So
cialist, he deserted their ranks last
year and registered as a Democrat,
so lhat he could seek that party's
nomination for the governorship.
Young Sinclair is a physics in
structor at Columbia University,
storm center of independent colle
giate thought. He considers Austrian
Socialists to have won a moral vic
tory in the present riots in Vienna.
"It's so much better," he said, "than
just having gone down without any
attempt to resist. It was most en
couraging to Socialists here, at least
to me, that the Socialists didn't go
soft."
