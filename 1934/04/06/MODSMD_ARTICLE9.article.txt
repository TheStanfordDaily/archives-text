WASHINGTON, April 5 (/P). —
Samuel Untermeyer, testifying be
fore the Senate Banking Committee,
said today that the stock market
control bill was far from perfect as
it now stands, but that "it would
be disastrous if it failed of enact
ment."
Untermeyer urged amendments
generally removing rigid restrictions
and increasing the discretionary
power of the regulatory groups. "We
have gone on too many years with a
great financial institution a law
unto itself," he said.
The day also saw the appearance
of a second revised draft of the bill,
drawn by Ferdinand Pecora, com
mittee counsel, and his associates.
It, too. was designed to decrease the
hard and fast rules of the bill and
expand discretionary authority.
While Untermeyer urged that the
margin requirements be left to the
Federal Reserve Board, with that
body's membership increased to
handle the new responsibility, Pe
cora's redraft contained the 60 per
cent cash margin requirement of
the old measure, with certain op
tional provisions.
Untermeyer suggested that three
new members be appointed to the
Reserve Board by the President,
and that the latter create a special
division within the board to take
charge of administering the margin
section.
