# U.C. HAS CHANCE TO BEAT TROY IN MEET TOMORROW
## 
### 
California's Bears and U.S.C.'s
Trojans, Stanford's two great rivals,
will engage in their long-awaited
showdown tomorrow at Edwards
Field in Berkeley. The outcome of
this meet should clear things up, as
to the Cards' outlook toward their
clashes with their prime opponents,
but it may confuse the dopesters
still more.
This Bear-Trojan meet itself is not
easy to figure, and the only surpris
ing result would be a one-sided win
for either team. Dean Cromwell's
southerners are supposed to have a
little the better of it, even with sev
eral of thir stars on the injured list.
However, the new Golden Bear var
sity coached by Brutus Hamilton,
has been steadily developing and is
a very distinct threat to the national
champions.
The Bears, stronger than in many
years, especially in the track events,
may easily score a majority of first
places. The Trojans are expected to
squeeze through to a close victory
by winning most of the seconds and
thirds, but this is far from sure.
Bob Lyon, the 1.C.4-A. champ,
should win the high hurdles, but
Coe and Charvet of the Bears look
good for second and third. With
Norman Paul out for several weeks
at least, Coe is the favorite in the
low barriers, and Charvet may well
beat out Hall of the southerners
for second. The relay will probably
go to the fleet Trojans.
California's hope for an upset lies
in the chance of their doing better
than expected in the field events.
Meek should win the shot put,
Miller or Fitzgerald the javelin,
Clark the broad jump, and Van
Tress the pole vault, and if Thomp
son can take the high jump or
Woods the discus from Brannon

and Harper of the Trojans, Califor
nia may win enough points for vic
tory. Seconds in the pole vault,
javelin, and discus would also help
the Golden Bear cause.
The results of this meet, however
it goes, should forecast some great
triple battles in coming relays and
such competition involving Stan
ford, California, and U.S.C. This is
why Stanfordites are particularly
interested in the outcome of to
moiTow's clash between her two
"deadly enemies."
