# CINDERMEN WIN AS BLACKMAN RUNS FAST 440
## Stanford Takes All But One First Place in Contest With S.F.U. Team ARTHUR UPSETS ALLEY Williams, Handicapped By Injury, Is Defeated 
### Jack Drown 
In a meet featured by A1 Blaek
man's 47.8 second quarter-mile and
the fact that Stanford took all but
one first place, Coach Dink Temple
ton's Cardinal track performers se
verely trounced a squad of S.F.U.
cindermen 96 2-3 to 33 1-3 Saturday
afternoon on Angell Field.
Blackmail's mark was the best
clocked time he had ever run, al
though unofficially he was timed in
47.6 behind Jimmy LuValle in the
U.C.L.A. meet. It ranks him with the
great quarter-milers of Card history
as well as establishing him as one
of the nation's fastest.
Lose One Event
Stanford won every event except
the broad jump in which Phil Wil
liams, the Indians' premier leaper,
handicapped by an injured leg, was
baiely beaten by Dale Childers of
the Dons. Childers' jump stretched
the tape 22 feet 4 3-8 inches, while
Williams' best effort is 22 feet
2% inches was nearly a foot less
than his winning leap in the U.C.
L.A. meet.
In the high jump, Stanford's Ho
wie Arthur, junior A.A.U. champion
of several years ago, caused a mild
sensation when he defeated Bill Al
ley, the Dons' highly touted star,
with a winning leap of 6 feet 2
inches, while Schween and Smith of
the Indians tied with the S.F.U. star
an inch below Arthur's mark.
Carl Thorns, Stanford's best sprin
ter, after a poor start in the 100-
yard dash, finished fast to defeat
Wisler and Ferrari of the visitors in
10 seconds flat and then a half-hour
later ran his fastest 220 of the sea
son to breast the tape well ahead of
the same two Dons in the good time
of 21.5 seconds.
Ninnno Wins Twice
One of the great performances of
the contest was the double win
turned in by Chuck Nimmo, Tem
pleton's sophomore mile sensation,
who, after an almost effortless 4:29.8
win in his specialty, coasted to an
other victory in the half-mile in the
time of 2:00.2.
Both hurdle races afforded specta
tors plenty of excitement. The close
finish between Captain Gus Meier,
Card leader, and Sam Klopstock,
great Stanford soph, in the 120-yard
highs had the stands in an uproar.
Although Meier won the event by
a very slim margin, his victory was
not allowed because he had knocked
over the eighth hurdle in an ad
joining lane, thus giving Klopstock
the victory. Meier came back a few
minutes later to take the 220-yard
lows in the excellent time of 23.8
seconds.
Two other splendid performances
were registered by John Mottram,
who tossed the javelin 206 feet 7
inches, and Johnny Lyman, who
heaved the shot 51 feet.11 1 y inches.
Deacon Clears 13-6
Bud Deacon and his two team
mates, Ginn and Anderson, swept
the pole vault for Stanford, Deacon
recording a mark of 13 feet 6 inches.
"Slinger" Dunn finally came out
from under wraps and uncorked a
throw of 152 feet inches to win
the discus.

cindermen 96 2-3 to 33 1-3 Saturday
afternoon on Angell Field.
Blackmail's mark was the best
clocked time he had ever run, al
though unofficially he was timed in
47.6 behind Jimmy LuValle in the
U.C.L.A. meet. It ranks him with the
great quarter-milers of Card history
as well as establishing him as one
of the nation's fastest.
Lose One Event
Stanford won every event except
the broad jump in which Phil Wil
liams, the Indians' premier leaper,
handicapped by an injured leg, was
baiely beaten by Dale Childers of
the Dons. Childers' jump stretched
the tape 22 feet 4 3-8 inches, while
Williams' best effort is 22 feet
2% inches was nearly a foot less
than his winning leap in the U.C.
L.A. meet.
In the high jump, Stanford's Ho
wie Arthur, junior A.A.U. champion
of several years ago, caused a mild
sensation when he defeated Bill Al
ley, the Dons' highly touted star,
with a winning leap of 6 feet 2
inches, while Schween and Smith of
the Indians tied with the S.F.U. star
an inch below Arthur's mark.
Carl Thorns, Stanford's best sprin
ter, after a poor start in the 100-
yard dash, finished fast to defeat
Wisler and Ferrari of the visitors in
10 seconds flat and then a half-hour
later ran his fastest 220 of the sea
son to breast the tape well ahead of
the same two Dons in the good time
of 21.5 seconds.
Ninnno Wins Twice
One of the great performances of
the contest was the double win
turned in by Chuck Nimmo, Tem
pleton's sophomore mile sensation,
who, after an almost effortless 4:29.8
win in his specialty, coasted to an
other victory in the half-mile in the
time of 2:00.2.
Both hurdle races afforded specta
tors plenty of excitement. The close
finish between Captain Gus Meier,
Card leader, and Sam Klopstock,
great Stanford soph, in the 120-yard
highs had the stands in an uproar.
Although Meier won the event by
a very slim margin, his victory was
not allowed because he had knocked
over the eighth hurdle in an ad
joining lane, thus giving Klopstock
the victory. Meier came back a few
minutes later to take the 220-yard
lows in the excellent time of 23.8
seconds.
Two other splendid performances
were registered by John Mottram,
who tossed the javelin 206 feet 7
inches, and Johnny Lyman, who
heaved the shot 51 feet.11 1 y inches.
Deacon Clears 13-6
Bud Deacon and his two team
mates, Ginn and Anderson, swept
the pole vault for Stanford, Deacon
recording a mark of 13 feet 6 inches.
"Slinger" Dunn finally came out
from under wraps and uncorked a
throw of 152 feet inches to win
the discus.

ton's Cardinal track performers se
verely trounced a squad of S.F.U.
cindermen 96 2-3 to 33 1-3 Saturday
afternoon on Angell Field.
Blackmail's mark was the best
clocked time he had ever run, al
though unofficially he was timed in
47.6 behind Jimmy LuValle in the
U.C.L.A. meet. It ranks him with the
great quarter-milers of Card history
as well as establishing him as one
of the nation's fastest.
Lose One Event
Stanford won every event except
the broad jump in which Phil Wil
liams, the Indians' premier leaper,
handicapped by an injured leg, was
baiely beaten by Dale Childers of
the Dons. Childers' jump stretched
the tape 22 feet 4 3-8 inches, while
Williams' best effort is 22 feet
2% inches was nearly a foot less
than his winning leap in the U.C.
L.A. meet.
In the high jump, Stanford's Ho
wie Arthur, junior A.A.U. champion
of several years ago, caused a mild
sensation when he defeated Bill Al
ley, the Dons' highly touted star,
with a winning leap of 6 feet 2
inches, while Schween and Smith of
the Indians tied with the S.F.U. star
an inch below Arthur's mark.
Carl Thorns, Stanford's best sprin
ter, after a poor start in the 100-
yard dash, finished fast to defeat
Wisler and Ferrari of the visitors in
10 seconds flat and then a half-hour
later ran his fastest 220 of the sea
son to breast the tape well ahead of
the same two Dons in the good time
of 21.5 seconds.
Ninnno Wins Twice
One of the great performances of
the contest was the double win
turned in by Chuck Nimmo, Tem
pleton's sophomore mile sensation,
who, after an almost effortless 4:29.8
win in his specialty, coasted to an
other victory in the half-mile in the
time of 2:00.2.
Both hurdle races afforded specta
tors plenty of excitement. The close
finish between Captain Gus Meier,
Card leader, and Sam Klopstock,
great Stanford soph, in the 120-yard
highs had the stands in an uproar.
Although Meier won the event by
a very slim margin, his victory was
not allowed because he had knocked
over the eighth hurdle in an ad
joining lane, thus giving Klopstock
the victory. Meier came back a few
minutes later to take the 220-yard
lows in the excellent time of 23.8
seconds.
Two other splendid performances
were registered by John Mottram,
who tossed the javelin 206 feet 7
inches, and Johnny Lyman, who
heaved the shot 51 feet.11 1 y inches.
Deacon Clears 13-6
Bud Deacon and his two team
mates, Ginn and Anderson, swept
the pole vault for Stanford, Deacon
recording a mark of 13 feet 6 inches.
"Slinger" Dunn finally came out
from under wraps and uncorked a
throw of 152 feet inches to win
the discus.
