# Masque Ball Royalty Race Opens Today
## Preferential Voting System To Name Candidates For Final Vote 
### Dorothy Sweet 
With balloting for the 20 popu
larity positions taking place at all
eating groups tonight, the annual
King-Queen race of the Masque
Ball gets under way. Gene Brown,
rallyman in charge of the contest,
states that the preferential voting
system â€¢ will be used. This means
that each voter must indicate three
choices for both King and Queen.
Because ballots came off the press
Saturday minus the name of Eleanor
"Hey Hey" Harris, several campus
factions are sponsoring a "write-in"
campaign for her in the Queen race.
Rally Committee asked the elec
torate to consider this candidacy
with the rest already on the ballot,
although the name will not appear
on the ballot itself.
Cubbison Declines
Two declinations are now in the
hands of the Rally Committee. Rose
Cubbison, last year's queen, has
withdrawn her name from the ballot.
Jerry Trautman, student body presi
dent, has likewise withdrawn from
the race.
Masque Ball bids will be put on
sale at the A.S.S.U. office tomorrow
morning at 9 o'clock. In order to
prevent overcrowding of the dance
floor, too many invitations will not
be sold. Prospective purchasers
should get their ducats early because
last-minute buyers are not guaran
teed bids.
Theme Unannounced
The complete theme of the cos
tume dance will be announced to
morrow, stated the Rally Commit
tee. The startling idea is unique in
Masque Ball annals. The orchestra
will feature the largest group of en
tertainers ever seen at a campus
daiice. If the negotiations, are com
pleted which were under way last
night, there will be 19 individuals to
provide music and song.
It is rumored that Stanfordites are
already scouring the campus for cos
tumes. To supply the demand, the
Coast's leading costumer will come
to the Farm next week with a com
plete selection of fancy dress togs.
It will not be necessary to go off the
campus, for all costumes will be
delivered here. Complete plans for
the provision of costumes will be
published later this week.
