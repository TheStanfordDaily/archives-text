# Scoffing Scientists Call 'Sheba's Capital' Myth
## 
### CHARLOTTE BURRIDGE 
"So far as we know there never
was a Queen of Sheha, and if there
was no such queen the chances are
that there was no capital for her."
Thus did Dr. Richard J. H. Gott
heil, professor of Semitic Languages
at Columbia University, express his
skepticism at the recently reported
discovery by two French fliers of the
losl capital of Sheba, identified with
the city of Mareb in Southwestern
Arabia.
"A. nice story about Solomon and
the Queen of Sheba," added Dr.
Gottheil, "but probably a mere
myth."
The losl city that French aviators
have reported finding seems to be
in the general vicinity of the sections j
of the desert described in the Koran
and Talmud over which the Queen
was supposed to have ruled.
But Dr. Leon Legrain, professor
of al the University of
Pennsylvania, scoffed at the report
of the fliers and said it was geo
graphically impossible for the city j
to have been the Queen of Sheba's (
capital. Mareb, which the professor
maintains has been identified as the |
Queen's capital, is far away from J

(he desert mentioned in the ex
plorers' dispatch.
"It is like comparing New York
with San Francisco," Legrain said.
John K. Wright, librarian of the
American Geographical Society, re
served judgment on the significance
of the discovery.
"The report of the discovery of
j uins in the Southern Desert of
Arabia is," he said, "intensely inter
esting to geographers and archae
ologists. Judgment regarding the
alleged identification of the ruins
with the Queen of Sheba's capital
must be withheld until more infor
mation is available as to both the
exact location and the character of
the ruins."
An interesting possibility is that
the aviators sighted the ruined city
of Übar of which Bertram Thomas
heard rumors from the natives dur
ing his journey across the Southern
Desert in 1930. Thomas observed
ancient caravan tracks leading to
the supposed site of this city.
The present Abyssinian dynasty
claimed direct descent from the
Queen of Sheba, who is also known
as Balkis or Makeda.
