# FLUNK RULE ELIMININATED FOR UPPER DIVISION, GRADS
## ACADEMIC COUNCIL MAKES CHANGES IN FIRST YEAR RULES Change Provides Reduction Of Required Units In First Two Years 
### 
Reduction of total lower division
requirements and creation of an op
portunity for taking three addi
tional units of eiectives for sopho
mores was effected Friday by the
Stanford Academic Council.
Practical consideration led , the
Council to accept proposals of the
Committee on Lower Division Ad
ministration, headed by Registrar
J. P. Mitchell, for revision of the
requirement provisions of the Uni
versity.
Gives Greater Freedom
The change, which provides the
reduction of required units and le
niency to sophomores in selecting
subjects, concerned the choosing of
subjects from the three groups of
studies in the lower division and will
affect only those enrolling after next
autumn quarter. The groups are:
"Arts and Letters," this name being
substituted for "Language and Lit
erature" (including Formative Art),
"Natural Sciences," and "Social Sci
ences."
In the past every student has been
required to take at nine units
in each of these groups each year.
Students will be benefited by the
new ruling which provides that the
student take only 15 units in eacTi
group during the first two years,
with not less than six units in each
group in each year.
More Eiectives Allowed
Without sacrificing any important
educational factors nor changing the
policies and < principles involved,
most students will have three addi
tional units of eiectives in their
sophomore year.
While the new provisions offered
some leniency in the distribution of
required units, foreign language pro
visions were made more stringent.
New Provision Made
A second broadening of opportu
nities for selection of subjects is seen
in the new provision for fulfillment
of English composition. Six units
of English composition were for
merly required during the second
year of University work (English 2a
and 2b). Beginning next autumn,
the six units of English composition
may be distributed over the two
year period of lower division work.
This will allow the student really
interested in writing to take at least
some of the required composition in
his first year.
