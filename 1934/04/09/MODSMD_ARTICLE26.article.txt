ing units, made during the last three

tering because of academic difficul
ties in the early part of their prep

Commenting upon the abolition
of probation and disqualification va
rious campus officials stated as fol
lows:.
Miss Mary Yost, dean of women:
"I hope that it will work out as well
as they expect it to."
George B. Culver, dean of men:
"It is more of the European idea,
where it is up to the student him
self to decide whether he wants to
spend the money to stay in college."
Professor Charles V. Taylor, pro
fessor of biology: "I was favorable
toward the move. I have the notion
that it is going to improve scholar
ship and place responsibility more
and more on the individual student."
Professor E. E. Robinson, director
of citizenship: It will be interest
ing to see how it develops. The im
portant thing, as I see it, is to note
the effect it has on the present sys
tem, as the new plan is rather a
decided change."
