# English Book Entries Due
## 
### 
Aspiring campus authors have but
a week's time remaining in which to
submit poetry and prose to the Eng
lish Club's annual publication, Year
book of Stanford Writing. The dead
lins for manuscripts is April 16.
The single aim of the Yearbook,
states Editor James Broughton, is to
collect the best work written on the
campus during the school year. Con
sequently all students are eligible
to contribute and to compete for the
two prizes of $25 each. The Year
book, being an anthology, has no
connection with such a publication
as "Stanford Criteria."
The English Club is also hand
ling the "Story" magazine college
short-story contest. The two best
short stories submitted to the Year
book by next Thursday, April 12,
will be entered in this $150 contest
of a national magazine.
If the 1934 Yearbook is to be
properly representative, Broughton
says, many more manuscripts must
be submitted for consideration by
the club. All contributions should
be placed as soon as possible in the
box marked "English Club" inside
the door of Room 207 in the English
Building.
