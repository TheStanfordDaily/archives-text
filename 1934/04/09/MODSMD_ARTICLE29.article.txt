# Administration Takes New Attitude Toward Low Academic Grades
## BEGINS FALL QUARTER Requirement for Degrees Remains Unchanged 
### Bob Calkins 
Strengthening their liberal and
enlightened attitude toward modern
education, the Stanford Academic
Council Friday eliminated the time
honored Farm institutions, "Proba
tion" and "Flunking", from the paths
of higher education for upper divi
sion and graduate students.
Beginning the Autumn quarter of
this year the Administration will
allow all advanced students who
have either failed or found them
selves mis-placed in one field of
study, to change their majors with
out the year's suspension prescribed
in Ihe past. The exemption does not
apply to lower division students,
however.
"University standards and degree
require m ents have not been
changed", said Registrar J. P. Mit
chell. explaining the new policy.
'The difference will be that instead
of receiving a series of pricks and
shoves, they will have to determine
for themselves if they have reached
a poirtt where further attendance is
not worth while."
With the new regulation, Stanford
becomes the second university in the
United States to exempt its advanced
students from probation and dis
qualification. The University of
Chicago is the only other American
institution which has turned to the
more enlightened methods of teach
ing with a similar arrangement.
These new policies are in line with
those of the outstanding liberal in
stitutions of Europe.
"Longer Testing Period"
Explaining the importance of the
revision of the university policies,
President Ray Lyman Wilbur said,
"The change in the scholarship rules
of the University in connection with
upper division and graduate students
will permit a longer period of time
fdr testing the scholarship capaci
ties of students."
Continuing, President Wilbur
stated that under the present rules
students who have chosen the wrong
department or who were supporting
themselves or who become ill, have
been unduly penalized by the re
sult of one quarter's record.
Grade Points Continue
Departments and schools will con
tinue to determine whether individ
ual students are qualified to enter
classes, and the existing grade point
system will be used as a means for
the student to determine at any
time whether fie is making progress
toward graduation or whether he is
getting farther away from it,
"The new plan will result in some
stiffening of the requirements of
the University for graduation,"
President Wilbur said. "The change
means that advanced students will
be viewed more from the standpoint
of members of the University and
put upon their own responsibility to
a larger extent," he concluded.
"Up to Student"
Registrar Mitchell predicted that
the following results would be forth
coming from ihe new regulations:
"If they (upper division students)
this freedom they may pile up
an almost insurmountable barrier
of minus grade points between
themselves and a degree. They will
have a greater responsibility toward
, their parents, to whom they may
have to justify their continued at
tendance. Instructors will probably
grade more severely; and schools
and departments will discourage the
uninterested. It will all tend to pro
mote that* upstanding self-reliance
and determination that should be
ieveloped as a Stanford character
istic."

themselves or who become ill, have
been unduly penalized by the re
sult of one quarter's record.
Grade Points Continue
Departments and schools will con
tinue to determine whether individ
ual students are qualified to enter
classes, and the existing grade point
system will be used as a means for
the student to determine at any
time whether fie is making progress
toward graduation or whether he is
getting farther away from it,
"The new plan will result in some
stiffening of the requirements of
the University for graduation,"
President Wilbur said. "The change
means that advanced students will
be viewed more from the standpoint
of members of the University and
put upon their own responsibility to
a larger extent," he concluded.
"Up to Student"
Registrar Mitchell predicted that
the following results would be forth
coming from ihe new regulations:
"If they (upper division students)
this freedom they may pile up
an almost insurmountable barrier
of minus grade points between
themselves and a degree. They will
have a greater responsibility toward
, their parents, to whom they may
have to justify their continued at
tendance. Instructors will probably
grade more severely; and schools
and departments will discourage the
uninterested. It will all tend to pro
mote that* upstanding self-reliance
and determination that should be
ieveloped as a Stanford character
istic."
Strengthening their liberal and
enlightened attitude toward modern
education, the Stanford Academic
Council Friday eliminated the time
honored Farm institutions, "Proba
tion" and "Flunking", from the paths
of higher education for upper divi
sion and graduate students.
Beginning the Autumn quarter of
this year the Administration will
allow all advanced students who
have either failed or found them
selves mis-placed in one field of
study, to change their majors with
out the year's suspension prescribed
in Ihe past. The exemption does not
apply to lower division students,
however.
"University standards and degree
require m ents have not been
changed", said Registrar J. P. Mit
chell. explaining the new policy.
'The difference will be that instead
of receiving a series of pricks and
shoves, they will have to determine
for themselves if they have reached
a poirtt where further attendance is
not worth while."
With the new regulation, Stanford
becomes the second university in the
United States to exempt its advanced
students from probation and dis
qualification. The University of
Chicago is the only other American
institution which has turned to the
more enlightened methods of teach
ing with a similar arrangement.
These new policies are in line with
those of the outstanding liberal in
stitutions of Europe.
"Longer Testing Period"
Explaining the importance of the
revision of the university policies,
President Ray Lyman Wilbur said,
"The change in the scholarship rules
of the University in connection with
upper division and graduate students
will permit a longer period of time
fdr testing the scholarship capaci
ties of students."
Continuing, President Wilbur
stated that under the present rules
students who have chosen the wrong
department or who were supporting
themselves or who become ill, have
been unduly penalized by the re
sult of one quarter's record.
