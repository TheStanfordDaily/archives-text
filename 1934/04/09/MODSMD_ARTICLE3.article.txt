Distinctive photography which
! gives the unusual effect of making
i shots taken in daylight appear as
1 though taken in the moonlight is a
I feature of the 1934 Quad which is
! entering the last stages of prepara
-1 tion for printing.
This effect comes as a result of the
i new photographic process developed
i by the research experts of the East
! man Company,' and only recently
made available for the first time to
the public. The pictures are taken
with a special film which is affected
; only by the infra-red light rays.
A startling effect has been ob
tained in a shot taken at the Stan
ford golf course, in which the club-
I house stands out black against a
sky heavy with white clouds, near
the horizon, while in the foreground
what appears to be a thick blanket
of snow covers the ground.
Another striking picture is the
| opener to the football section—a shot
of the stadium taken from the old
oval. The stadium and groups of
eucalyptus trees stand silhouetted in
white agains a background of black
j sky.
j The photographs were taken by
George Watters, '34, who also did
work on last year's Quad. It is pos
sible that similar work may be in
cluded in next year's Illustrated Re
view Series.
