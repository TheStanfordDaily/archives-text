# University or Country Club?
## 
### 
Tlie minority (there always is one) whlcTi opposed, in
(lie Academic Council, the move to change Stanford's edu
cational setup by eliminating probation and disqualifica
tion among upper classmen and graduates contended that
the move will tend to allow a "country club atmosphere"
to permeate these dear old grounds.
And what it' some students do adopt that outlook? It
wouldn't be anything new. Generally there have been a
few who have made some campus their social headquar
ters—and probably there will be more of them in the
future.
If they want to spend their fill every three months
here, they now have the privilege. That is rather high for
country club dues, when you have to pay additional fees
for your golfing, but who is the administration to turn
down money? Let it he understood, however, that the
move has not been made with the hopes of collecting a few
more dollars. The difference AVill be too small to consider.
The Daily doubts the statements that students, once
they leave the lower division, will forsake books for so
ciety. The students realize that they can't afford to. From
now on, the basis of grades will be merit, according to the
administration, and not the fact that a flunk will mean
disqualification. Those days are passed.
Although it will mean a raising of the standards for
graduation to some extent, the move will give those of us
in school a chance to get a little better insight on what soon
will be facing us daily—the outside world. In business, we
are told, one must be aßle to deliver efficiency and pro
gressiveness if he is to become a leader. The same will
apply in scholastics.
The move w,as the second major step taken bv the
University in the last six months. In November, a drastic
revision of entrance requirements was made, whereby the
freshman year of high school would not be counted in
applications for matriculation here.
Now if the authorities could just stamp out that last
trace of marking on the basis of some antiquated grade
curve, things would be even belter.
