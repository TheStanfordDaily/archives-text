# Let's Stay on Our Own

The Daily resumed regular publication of Hie Bull Ses
sion in Friday's issue, with Dave Mellinkotf as U>e author,
and oddly enough we come to literal blows right off the
bat. To refresh our readers' memories, the contents of tlie
Hull Session do not reflect any policies of the Daily.
"For Sale: One Honor ('ode" was the title of Dave's
first piece. He writes that the fact that four students were
suspended for cheating in examinations last month places
a premium on the fairness of tests and suggests that we
return to the old system of having professors remaining in
the room.
Furthermore, he argues that the four are on the outside
looking in because their "particular brand of cheating was
simple, stupid, artless. The real crime was bad cheating,
not bad ethics."
Probably his statements contain more truth than fiction.
Hut who wants to have a prof parked in front of the room?
About the only thing he could do would be to develop more
artful cheating by making the offenders even more cau
tious.
Dr. Wilbur already has announced that he dislikes the
idea of eliminating the honor code, and most certainly the
campus should agree. I'nless a person is attending school
with the sole purpose of having a piece of brass hung on
him bv Phi Beta Kappa, he should be able to laugh at
cribbers. We say let them go as far as they can without
being caught; they'll pay for it in the long run. And so
far as substituting the faculty for llie honor code is con
cerned, one is so much better than the other that lliere is
no comparison.
The Bull Session also made point of eliminating grades
entirely. Ah, but that's I' topi a! We'd never get there!
