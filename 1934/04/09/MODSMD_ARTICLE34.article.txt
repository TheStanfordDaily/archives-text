DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY
(Paramount)
At the Stanford Theatre
The individual who can discover
what is wrong with this filmization
of the Casella play will be in a fair
way of knowing the entire secret of
just why nine out of ten plays are
more effective than their celluloid
transcriptions. And to one without
that secret it is a little confusing to
realize that here is a good play faith
fully adapted, sensitively and even
beautifully directed, and in the main
intelligently acted—and yet not truly
deeply moving.
This picture's failure is akin to
that of ''Berkeley Square," and per
haps explained by the fact that in
neither case does the delicately fan
tastic nature of the subject permit
the intimacy of a motion picture
camera; Hollywood has become dis
tressingly closeup-conscious.' Obvi
ously, a closeup of Frederic March
which shows his neat Hollywood
marcel and carefully arranged cir
cles under his eyes and which per
mits us to watch his struggles with
a monocle and a pseudo-foreign ac
cent does not lend conviction to the
idea that this is Death on a spree.
Mitchell Leisen has done a very
creditable job of the direction, and
the effectiveness of the tale is con
siderably heightened by excellent
settings and a fine musical score (of
which the use of the Sibelius Valse
Triste is a highlight).
At times convincing, Frederic
Mrjrch is often faintly annoying in
his performance of the lead role, in
which he gustoes too much at first
and subsequently swaggers over
much. What has happened to the
delightful March of other days?
To Sir Guy Standing as the host
go the acting laurels of the piece;
he is excellent in a difficult role.
Evalyn Venable is an appealing if
lukewarm Grazia.
For all its faults, a beautiful pic
ture not to be missed. —Chapin

IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT
(Columbia)
At the Mcnlo Theatre
The last of the current run of
cross-country bus stories, "It Hap
pened One Night," is decidedly the
best. Reasons are Claudette Col
bert, a good supporting cast, origi
nality of gags, and the same batty
atmosphere that made the movie
"Three-Cornered Moon" very comic.
The plot, light, ridiculous, and
sometimes trite, concerns million
heiress Colbert's flight from father
in Florida to husband in New York,
aided by newspaperman Clark Ga
ble, and a pair of legs which, if
.somewhat useless for walking, are
more efficacious than the thumb
for hitch-hiking. Result is mutual
love and anullment of objectionable
marriage.
In the cast are Gable Walter Con
nolly, Roscoe Karns, and Alan Hale,
plus Colbert, who when not a De-
Mille courtesan reveals a remark
able brilliance in comedy. Gable
surprises by forgetting romance, and
by h's hitch-niking and piggy-back
scenes.
Comedy is as inane as the charac
ters and is closely related to them,
depending upon momentary situa
tions and pantomine most of the
time. Most of the individual gags
are new, arising spontaneously from
the intricacies of the plot, and sel
dom strained or forced.
The bus background is slight and
greatly idealized, what with com
munity sings, etc. Lovers' misun
derstanding again occupy a promi
nent place in the film. Directed by
Columbia's man-of-all-work, Frank
Capra, the picture is one of the best
comedies of the year. —Place

of the Casella play will be in a fair
way of knowing the entire secret of
just why nine out of ten plays are
more effective than their celluloid
transcriptions. And to one without
that secret it is a little confusing to
realize that here is a good play faith
fully adapted, sensitively and even
beautifully directed, and in the main
intelligently acted—and yet not truly
deeply moving.
This picture's failure is akin to
that of ''Berkeley Square," and per
haps explained by the fact that in
neither case does the delicately fan
tastic nature of the subject permit
the intimacy of a motion picture
camera; Hollywood has become dis
tressingly closeup-conscious.' Obvi
ously, a closeup of Frederic March
which shows his neat Hollywood
marcel and carefully arranged cir
cles under his eyes and which per
mits us to watch his struggles with
a monocle and a pseudo-foreign ac
cent does not lend conviction to the
idea that this is Death on a spree.
Mitchell Leisen has done a very
creditable job of the direction, and
the effectiveness of the tale is con
siderably heightened by excellent
settings and a fine musical score (of
which the use of the Sibelius Valse
Triste is a highlight).
At times convincing, Frederic
Mrjrch is often faintly annoying in
his performance of the lead role, in
which he gustoes too much at first
and subsequently swaggers over
much. What has happened to the
delightful March of other days?
To Sir Guy Standing as the host
go the acting laurels of the piece;
he is excellent in a difficult role.
Evalyn Venable is an appealing if
lukewarm Grazia.
For all its faults, a beautiful pic
ture not to be missed. —Chapin

IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT
(Columbia)
At the Mcnlo Theatre
The last of the current run of
cross-country bus stories, "It Hap
pened One Night," is decidedly the
best. Reasons are Claudette Col
bert, a good supporting cast, origi
nality of gags, and the same batty
atmosphere that made the movie
"Three-Cornered Moon" very comic.
The plot, light, ridiculous, and
sometimes trite, concerns million
heiress Colbert's flight from father
in Florida to husband in New York,
aided by newspaperman Clark Ga
ble, and a pair of legs which, if
.somewhat useless for walking, are
more efficacious than the thumb
for hitch-hiking. Result is mutual
love and anullment of objectionable
marriage.
In the cast are Gable Walter Con
nolly, Roscoe Karns, and Alan Hale,
plus Colbert, who when not a De-
Mille courtesan reveals a remark
able brilliance in comedy. Gable
surprises by forgetting romance, and
by h's hitch-niking and piggy-back
scenes.
Comedy is as inane as the charac
ters and is closely related to them,
depending upon momentary situa
tions and pantomine most of the
time. Most of the individual gags
are new, arising spontaneously from
the intricacies of the plot, and sel
dom strained or forced.
The bus background is slight and
greatly idealized, what with com
munity sings, etc. Lovers' misun
derstanding again occupy a promi
nent place in the film. Directed by
Columbia's man-of-all-work, Frank
Capra, the picture is one of the best
comedies of the year. —Place
