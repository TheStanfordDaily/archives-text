# WHY IT'S NEWS
## Europe Rests 
### CROMPTON BANCS Jr 
There is little news from Europe
just now. This does not mean there
is nothing of importance. It simply
means a lull following the last few
exciting months. But past history
leads most people to believe that
another irisis will occur when, and
if, Germany gets stronger—which
may he iu two years, or even so one*.
No one will dispute that Hitler
was the man of Europe in 1933. The
first year of Nazi rule served to ex
pose the poor team work of Ger
many's enemies. The two most no
ticeable results were: (1) the great
decline of French prestige, both
among her allies and abroad; (2)
Italy's coming to the aid of Austria
and Hungary against Germany. The
second happening more or less
checked the effects of the first on
the immediate line-up of powers in
Europe. The damage to France's
influence seems to be more perma
nent.
What Is Happening?
No nation in Europe can afford
war at the present time. What is
more, no nation dares risk it. The
French, .who arc realists at heart,
admit nothing can stop German re
armament—already in progress. This
fact among others has made states
men sit down and talk it over in
stead of swearing at their enemies
for the home-folks' benefit.
So it looks like practical states
manship may find some way of in
suring peace and a share in the on
coming world business recovery for
Europe—at least until the various
nations get strong enough to go to
war. This may be a long time, for
it is hard to see just how most of
the nations of Europe are going to
fight if the TJ.S. refuses to lend them
money to blow each other to bits.
So a war seems rather far away.
The decline of France, with the

rise of Hitler and the lesser rise of
Mussolini has left Europe without
definite leadership. In most coun
tries faith in democracy is dying.
This had a lot to do with France's
disturbances; they are not over yet.
Doumergue's strong-arm cabinet has
failed to restore respect for the gov
ernment. Ait actual revolution is un
likely, though, for the French peas
ant is very conservative.
Security vs. Leadership
Many Frenchmen feel that the
central European alliances were un
wise and costly. Now that France's
border forts are finished, she may
be willing to sacrifice leadership for
security from invasion. If France
continues trying to aid Czechoslo- ,
vakia, Poland, etc., a cosily arma
ment seems inevitable.
On the other hand, the loss of
leadership is a hard blow to take,
and it may cause trouble in central
Europe, where Germany will un
doubtedly dig in. If the present set- !
up is to be kept, it seems as though i
France and Italy, whose interests :
are similar, will have to stick to
gether. So far they have not. It is
this situation, plus Hitler's appar
ent permanence, that has forced the
statesmen to think instead of talking.
Meanwhile another crisis is brew
ing.

this situation, plus Hitler's appar
ent permanence, that has forced the
statesmen to think instead of talking.
Meanwhile another crisis is brew
ing.

There is little news from Europe
just now. This does not mean there
is nothing of importance. It simply
means a lull following the last few
exciting months. But past history
leads most people to believe that
another irisis will occur when, and
if, Germany gets stronger—which
may he iu two years, or even so one*.
No one will dispute that Hitler
was the man of Europe in 1933. The
first year of Nazi rule served to ex
pose the poor team work of Ger
many's enemies. The two most no
ticeable results were: (1) the great
decline of French prestige, both
among her allies and abroad; (2)
Italy's coming to the aid of Austria
and Hungary against Germany. The
second happening more or less
checked the effects of the first on
the immediate line-up of powers in
Europe. The damage to France's
influence seems to be more perma
nent.
What Is Happening?
No nation in Europe can afford
war at the present time. What is
more, no nation dares risk it. The
French, .who arc realists at heart,
admit nothing can stop German re
armament—already in progress. This
fact among others has made states
men sit down and talk it over in
stead of swearing at their enemies
for the home-folks' benefit.
So it looks like practical states
manship may find some way of in
suring peace and a share in the on
coming world business recovery for
Europe—at least until the various
nations get strong enough to go to
war. This may be a long time, for
it is hard to see just how most of
the nations of Europe are going to
fight if the TJ.S. refuses to lend them
money to blow each other to bits.
So a war seems rather far away.
The decline of France, with the

rise of Hitler and the lesser rise of
Mussolini has left Europe without
definite leadership. In most coun
tries faith in democracy is dying.
This had a lot to do with France's
disturbances; they are not over yet.
Doumergue's strong-arm cabinet has
failed to restore respect for the gov
ernment. Ait actual revolution is un
likely, though, for the French peas
ant is very conservative.
Security vs. Leadership
Many Frenchmen feel that the
central European alliances were un
wise and costly. Now that France's
border forts are finished, she may
be willing to sacrifice leadership for
security from invasion. If France
continues trying to aid Czechoslo- ,
vakia, Poland, etc., a cosily arma
ment seems inevitable.
On the other hand, the loss of
leadership is a hard blow to take,
and it may cause trouble in central
Europe, where Germany will un
doubtedly dig in. If the present set- !
up is to be kept, it seems as though i
France and Italy, whose interests :
are similar, will have to stick to
gether. So far they have not. It is
this situation, plus Hitler's appar
ent permanence, that has forced the
statesmen to think instead of talking.
