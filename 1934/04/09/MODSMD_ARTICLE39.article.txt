# Card Nine Outhits St Mary's to Win, 9-7
## Tenth League Game Lost by Moragans Anderson, Relief Hurler, Fans Last St. Mary s Batter To Cut Short Four-Run Ninth Inning Rally 
### 
Eight St. Mary's errors combined with 14 safe Stanford bingles and
some excellent relief pitching on the part of Stan Anderson, gave Stanford
a 9-7 victory over the Gael nine Saturday. It was the tenth straight defeat

for St. Mary's in the California In-*
tercollegiate Baseball Association.
Anderson Relieves
John Campbell, newly transferred ;
from Menlo J.C. this quarter, started i
his second game of the week for j
Stanford, and lasted five innings, lie ;
through his first four safely, but .
an accumulation of hits and errors
descended upon him in the fifth and
three Gael runs scored.
Stanford got back four tallies in
their half inning and Coach Harry I
Wolter sent in sore-armed Stan An
derson, who had already saved one !
ball game for the Indians within the ,
week, to turn a winning trick again, j
Anderson got on famously for three 1
innings, with his team playing good i
ball.
Visitors Rally
In the ninth the visitors started a !
rally that for a few tense moments
threatened the Stanford victory. !
With one out, the head of the Gael j
batting order came up, and Harris ;
singled. Evart, the cat-calling cen
ter fielder, was disposed of, and then
Kane, Wilson, Hanna, and Bernar
dinelli hit safely in succession.
Four runs crossed the plate before
Anderson settled, down, conferred '
with Catcher Jimmy Massey and
struck out Owens to end the game.
