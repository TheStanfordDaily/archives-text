YEAR'S BIGGEST
SWIM MEET CARDED
With night athletic events gaining j
popularity rapidly, Coach Nort
Thornton of the Cardinal aquatic
forces inaugurates night swimming
meets on the campus, scheduling the
third annual Stanford swimming re
lays this Friday night.
The relays, major water sports
evenl on the campus this year and
one of the outstanding meets on the
Coast, present an ambitious array of
swimming talent. Teams represent
ing 20 different, clubs, colleges, and
schools in the three divisions have
already signified their intention of
entering and will bring with them
the greatest array of aquatic stars
seen at Stanford in several years.
MANY STARS
TO BE ON HAND
Ted Wiget, who won the National
Intercollegiate free style champion
ship three time at various distances
while swimming for Stanford, will
return to the Farm as a member of
the Olympic Club team. Among the
other outstanding mermen who will
compete are Buster Olds, holder of
the American 300-meter medley rec
ord; Northern California backstroke
champion Gordon Corsno; Stanford s
Captain Bog Clark, National Inter
collegiate record holder in the 300-
yard, medley; and Ed Thorndson,
Stanford's former National Intercol
legiate diving champion.
These men will all swim in Class
A, but Class B for college freshmen
and junior colleges and Class C for
high schools will present many fu
ture swimming greats. The two Long
Beach schools, junior college and
high school, will represent the south
em part of the state. These two
schools have held the whiphand ever
prep swim circles in the South for
so long it has almost become a tra
dition.
THE WEEK-END
IN SPORTS
Although they failed to defeat the
Trojans, California's newly powerful
| track squad hung out a big warning
j of trouble ahead for the Indians in
! the Big Meet when the Bears lost
i Saturday's meet to U.S.C. 69 to 62.
While the Bears were vainly claw
| ing at the walls of Troy, Stanford
j had an easy time with U.S.F. The
! Indians didn't defeat the Dons as
badly as did U.S.C. but they scored
more first places which may give
! dopesters something to work on in
figuring out the Stanford-Southern
! California meet May 5. It looks as
i though the three major colleges are
i more closely matched this year than
! they ever have been.
While Stanford was drubbing St.
, Mary's on the Sunken diamond, Cal
j ifornia drew a step nearer the C.I.
1 B.A. championship, defeating U.S.C.
at Berkeley. The Bears have only
to win one of their remaining four
! games with Stanford to clinch the
j title, but they may find it more dif
! ficult than they suppose as the In
! dians looked better in their last two
| games than they have since the
| league schedule opened. The second
! game of the series is scheduled for
\ the local diamond tomorrow.
The tennis squad was krtocked
j completely out of the championship
I picture by the Trojan squad in los
ing its second match to the Angel
enos. Matches with U.C.L.A. and
j California remain on the schedule.
