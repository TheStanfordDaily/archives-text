## 
### 
Climaxing 19 holes of play with a
birdie four on the par five first, Don
Edwards dethroned Jack Hocrner
from the number one position on the
Stanford golf team in a match that
was played Friday afternoon at the
campus course.
The match was marked by the
even play of the two men. On the
first nine both had 37 and the match
score was even. Edwards picked up
a lead of two holes with only three
left to play due to Hoerner's poor
putting. The former then lost the
next two holes and the match went
to the 18th green. The 18 was tied
and they started the 19th.
Both men hit extremely long
drives in the center of the fairway.
Edwards was to the left with a short

trap between him and the green. His
next shot carried perfectly over the
trap, kicked forward and laid down
on the green. Hoerner shot to the ;
right on his second.
In the putting Edwards played
safe, shot close to the hole and then
sunk his four. Hoerner approached
the green and used two puts to lose
the position.
