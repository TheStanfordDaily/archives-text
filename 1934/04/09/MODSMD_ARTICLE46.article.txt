# FROSH LOSE 10-4 BASEBALL GAME TO GAL CUB NINE
## 
### 
Aided by Cardinal errors, the Cal
ifornia freshman baseball team went i
on i! seventh and eight inning hitting !
and base-running rampage to trans
form a close baseball game with the
Stanford yearlings into a lop-sided
10 to 4 victory. The game was played
at Edwards Field in Berkeley.
Three Stanford moundsmen, Lan
son Davis, Tim McClure, and Bill
Quade, were nicked for 13 hits dur
ing the game, while the Indian frosh
batsmen were able to collect only
seven base bingles from Art Rinne,
Bear right-hander.
Davis worked an the box success
fully until the fateful seventh, and
he was relieved by Quade, who
lasted but a short time in the face
â€¢ of ihe Bear pounding.
The second game of the series will
be played on the Stanford field next
i Saturday; the Card yearlings arc
acknowledged a slightly better
s chance of victory this week.
