# Troy Defeats Card Netmen
## Match Score 6 to 3 After Three Hours' Play 
### 
Stanford netmen went down to
! their third successive defeat Satur
i day afternoon, and their conquerox-s
i were for the second time the Tro
j jans.
Not because U.S.C. was particu
larly strong, or the Cardinals par
ticularly weak, the match score was
six to three at the end of thi'ee hours
of play.
Mako Gives Thrills
By far the most interesting and
exciting match of the day was that
of Gene Mako, Trojan sophomore,
against Captain Chuck Otis. Otis
against Captain Chuck Otis. In the
first set, the score went to 9-7, and
in the second Mako finally won out,
7-5. â€¢
In the second match, Sam Lee won
lhe only singles victory by a default
from Jess Millman, who could not
play because of blistered feet which
he got on the Berkeley coui'ts the
day before.
Law Inconsistent
John Law won his first set from
Castlen, weakened and lost the next
two and the match. Law will have to
become much more consistent before
he will win any conference matches
in the number three singles.
Monty Shwayder, Dan Clark, and
Ted Lilenthal all lost their singles
assignments in easy sets, just as in
the fn-st doubles Otis and Ondy Mar
tin lost in easy fashion to Mako and
Vernon Johns.
The varsity courts wece in per
fect condition, and the stroking
should have been ideal for the In
dians upon their own courts. But
it did not work out that way.
However, the Cax'dinal second and
third doubles teams finally crashed
through with wins, Lee and Law
conquering Millman and Castlen in
three long sets, and Bogan and
Shwayder winning over the Trojan
third doubles, 6-0, 6-1.
