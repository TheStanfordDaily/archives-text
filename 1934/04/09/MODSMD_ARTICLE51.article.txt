## 'S.S. Glencairn' Scheduled For Thursday Night 
### 
"S.S. .Glencairn," that group of
four sea plays by Eugene O'Neill
comprising '"Moon of the Carrib
bees," "The Long Voyage Home,"
"Bound East for Cardiff," and "In
the Zone," will be read on Thursday
evening in the Little Theatre under
Sword and Sandals' sponsorship.
Robert Brauns, well-known fox- 1
varied characterizations in campus
and Palo Alto productions, appears
in the new role of director of this
reading. He has selected a cast of
oh! and new players which should
give four dramatic sketches a vivid
reality.
Crew Capable
The crew of the S.S. Glencairn is
composed of the Irishman, Driscoll
(William Gwinn), Bow-Bells Cocky
(Waldo Salt), the rough Yank (Paul
Crary), lumbering Swede Olson
(Carter Meyer), mysterious young
Englishman Smith (George Leav
ens), stupid Ivan (Dick Dawson),
Scotty (Joe . Lawry), Old Tom
(Thomas Seller), Jack (William
Knapp), Paddy (Robert Cathcart),
Davis (Henry Brill), the Captain

(Jeannette Rosenfeld and Henrietta
Jones); Fat Joe (Robert Cathcart),
and Nick, a crimp (Robert Dwan).

readings as well as the recent pro
duction of "Distant Drums." Paul
Crary is a veteran of four campus
shows, "An Enemy of the People,"
"Hawk Island," "Arms and the
Man," and "Distant Drums." Waldo
Salt, writer, director-actor, is known
for variety of characterization as
well as versatility of interest in the
theatre.
Robert Cathcart's best campus
role was, perhaps, the Nameless Man
in Clemence Dane's "Granite," and
he was one of the members of th*e
cast of "Private Lives" which Sword
and Sandals presented as its first
reading.
Although a sophomore, Richard
Dawson has been heard roaring a
number of dialects at audiences.

the campus stage; William Knapp,
seen thus far only in readings, has

done some good work; Henry Brill |

oral roles to their credit, as has Jo

peared in "Arms and the Man" as
well as the reading of "She Stoops
to Conquer." Jeanette Rosenfeld
was Trixie Flynn in "Let 'Em Eat
Cake." Mary Liles played Moonyeen

Thru." Henrietta Jones played the

Virginia Marvin is most familiar
to campus audiences, having ap
peared in "Arms and the Man" as
well as the reading of "She Stoops
to Conquer." Jeanette Rosenfeld
was Trixie Flynn in "Let 'Em Eat
Cake." Mary Liles played Moonyeen
in a San Jose production of "Smilin' \
Thru." Henrietta Jones played the
Queen's lady in "Richard II."
The reading of "S.S. Glencairn"
will begin promptly at 7:30 o'clock.
To cover the royalty charge on the
plays an admission charge of 1C
cents will be collected.
"S.S. .Glencairn," that group of
four sea plays by Eugene O'Neill
comprising '"Moon of the Carrib
bees," "The Long Voyage Home,"
"Bound East for Cardiff," and "In
the Zone," will be read on Thursday
evening in the Little Theatre under
Sword and Sandals' sponsorship.
Robert Brauns, well-known fox- 1
varied characterizations in campus
and Palo Alto productions, appears
in the new role of director of this
reading. He has selected a cast of
oh! and new players which should
give four dramatic sketches a vivid
reality.
Crew Capable
The crew of the S.S. Glencairn is
composed of the Irishman, Driscoll
(William Gwinn), Bow-Bells Cocky
(Waldo Salt), the rough Yank (Paul
Crary), lumbering Swede Olson
(Carter Meyer), mysterious young
Englishman Smith (George Leav
ens), stupid Ivan (Dick Dawson),
Scotty (Joe . Lawry), Old Tom
(Thomas Seller), Jack (William
Knapp), Paddy (Robert Cathcart),
Davis (Henry Brill), the Captain
(Robert Dwan).
Other characters in the plays in
clude Bella (Virginia Marvin), and
Pearl (Mary Liles), two West In
dian negresses; Kate and Freda
(Jeannette Rosenfeld and Henrietta
Jones); Fat Joe (Robert Cathcart),
and Nick, a crimp (Robert Dwan).
Cast Experienced
Gwinn has been seen in several
readings as well as the recent pro
duction of "Distant Drums." Paul
Crary is a veteran of four campus
shows, "An Enemy of the People,"
"Hawk Island," "Arms and the
Man," and "Distant Drums." Waldo
Salt, writer, director-actor, is known
for variety of characterization as
well as versatility of interest in the
theatre.
Robert Cathcart's best campus
role was, perhaps, the Nameless Man
in Clemence Dane's "Granite," and
he was one of the members of th*e
cast of "Private Lives" which Sword
and Sandals presented as its first
reading.
Although a sophomore, Richard
Dawson has been heard roaring a
number of dialects at audiences.
Playgoers will recall his Kruger in
"Let 'Em Eat Cake," the Beefeater
in "The Critic." George Leavens first
appeared here as the Duke in "Ro
meo and Juliet" two years ago.
Rising Stars Included
Thomas Seller is a newcomer to
the campus stage; William Knapp,
seen thus far only in readings, has

done some good work; Henry Brill |
and Robert Dwan each have sev- I
oral roles to their credit, as has Jo
seph Lawry.
