# CULL SESSION
## STABILIZING STANFORD 
### 
Americans are born and bred on
>uch optimistic little aphorisms as:
"It's an ill wind that blows no good."
This particular tid-bit has been so
omnipresent that Americans custo
marily breathe deeply, and leave
their windows open at night. The
stock market crash and four years
of depression have done much to
discredit the tidy phrase; the Aca
demic Council has come to its res
cue.

From the unwelcome union of de
faulted bonds and diminishing reg
istration was born the "800." From
this same depression matrimony
comes a second offspring: hence
forth no junior or senior flunks
from the Farm. While in days gone
by, the Registrar suffered no sleep
less nights at flunking an occasional !
student, flunking out $114 checks in j
a period of depression is another j
matter.

But regardless of motive, the ad- j
ministration has removed some of |
the "pricks and shoves" from the j
peace and quiet of educational slum- j
ber. We have taken one long step ,
on the golden road of abolition of !
grades.

Still, one may wonder many
things. If the demands of enlight
ened education dictate that roughs
shall no longer roll, why not also j
slop them from wobbling? If the j
threat of flunking is not essential to i
craniums, has .not the value of j
grind culture into junior and senior \
grades also been highly overrated? j
There now remains no logical ex- .
cuse for the grade system; ihe ad
ministration admits that "pricks and j
shoves" are undesirable. The Aca- j
demic Council can the cultural
rose smell still sweeter by dethron- J
ing it completely.

What will be the result of the no
flunk system? If entrance require
ments are not tightened, Stanford
will soon become the happy hunting
grounds for all the crackpots and

dull wits who are unable to enter
U.S.C. If the system is executed sin
cerely, it will be educationally prog
ressive and financially successful.
But if students, who rate "fourth
division" on the aptitude test, con
tinue to matriculate at the "Harvard
of the West," the plan will be finan
cially gainful and nothing more.
Stanford will suffer.

And so the "ill wind" of depres
sion has blown the flunk out of Stan
ford. Perhaps it will take a cyclone
to make the blow-out complete.

cerely, it will be educationally prog
ressive and financially successful.
But if students, who rate "fourth
division" on the aptitude test, con

of the West," the plan will be finan

Stanford will suffer.

And so the "ill wind" of depres

to make the blow-out complete.

Americans are born and bred on
>uch optimistic little aphorisms as:
"It's an ill wind that blows no good."
This particular tid-bit has been so
omnipresent that Americans custo
marily breathe deeply, and leave
their windows open at night. The
stock market crash and four years
of depression have done much to
discredit the tidy phrase; the Aca
demic Council has come to its res
cue.

From the unwelcome union of de
faulted bonds and diminishing reg
istration was born the "800." From
this same depression matrimony
comes a second offspring: hence
forth no junior or senior flunks
from the Farm. While in days gone
by, the Registrar suffered no sleep
less nights at flunking an occasional !
student, flunking out $114 checks in j
a period of depression is another j
matter.

But regardless of motive, the ad- j
ministration has removed some of |
the "pricks and shoves" from the j
peace and quiet of educational slum- j
ber. We have taken one long step ,
on the golden road of abolition of !
grades.

Still, one may wonder many
things. If the demands of enlight
ened education dictate that roughs
shall no longer roll, why not also j
slop them from wobbling? If the j
threat of flunking is not essential to i
craniums, has .not the value of j
grind culture into junior and senior \
grades also been highly overrated? j
There now remains no logical ex- .
cuse for the grade system; ihe ad
ministration admits that "pricks and j
shoves" are undesirable. The Aca- j
demic Council can the cultural
rose smell still sweeter by dethron- J
ing it completely.

What will be the result of the no
flunk system? If entrance require
ments are not tightened, Stanford
will soon become the happy hunting
grounds for all the crackpots and

dull wits who are unable to enter
U.S.C. If the system is executed sin
cerely, it will be educationally prog
ressive and financially successful.
But if students, who rate "fourth
division" on the aptitude test, con
