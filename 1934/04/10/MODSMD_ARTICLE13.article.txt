Colonel E. R. Bradley (left), veteran Kentucky sportsman, is shown before a Senate committee in Washing
ton as he told Senator Huey P. Long, the indisputable "Kingfish" (right), that he "bet on anything." Long
claimed to senatorial confrers that he would show that Bradley and Colonel John P. Sullivan of New Orleans
"owned their own betting kitty." Bradley said that he did not know D. D. More, whose recent appointment as
collector of internal revenue at Nef Orleans precipitated the furor. (Associated Press Photo)
