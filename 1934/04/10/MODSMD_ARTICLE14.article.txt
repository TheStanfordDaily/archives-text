# Peirce Gives Radio Speech
## Professor Emeritus Tells Of Plant Stores 
### 
The greatest factory in the world
is contained in the leaves of plants,
according to George J. Peirce, pro
fessor emeritus of botany and plant
physiology, who last night spoke on
the Stanford University Hour over
radio station KPO.
There is no general store of food
in nature, said Dr. Peirce. Here and
there in the earth's crust are stores
of oil, coal, and minerals, iVi addi
tion to bodies of salt and fresh water.
These stores supply materials for
implements and fuel. But there is
no accumulation of food, or of any
raw material from which man knows
how to make food.
Plants Are Factories
Food is made annually or season
ally in the faculty of the plants,
whenever and wherever there is
sufficient warmth and water. The
green color of the leaves signifies
that enei'gy is being absorbed from
the sunlight, explained the profes
sor. If all of the sun's rays were
absorbed the leaves would appear
black, but only energy of certain
wave lengths is assimilated, causing
the green color. This absorbed en
ergy in the transformation of raw
materials to food products.
Dr. Peirce continued to say that
the manner in which the plants cre
ate food from these raw materials
remains the secret of this great fac
tory in spite of the most careful,
persistent, and ingenious study by
botanists, chemists, and physiologists.
The factory is known, the materials
and energy are available, the prod
ucts are priceless and indispensable,
but the process remains a mystery.
