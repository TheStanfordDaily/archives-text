Skull and Snakes, organized ath-
I letes of the University, have chosen
i the proverbially ill-omened date of
| Friday the 13th to sweil the funds

j track team East to the ICAAAA
I meet in May.
The event is an all-University,
I informal, dollar-a-bid dance in the
| Women's gym.
With $650 in proceeds from the
j benefit track meet held at the end of
I last quarter tucked away in the
treasury, the Skullmen have liigh
ambitions of multiplying the amount
several times within the next few
weeks to have enough on hand by
the middle of May to finance the
trip. The sum of $3,000 has been set
as a goal.
An unlimited quantity of tickets
have been placed on sale at the
A.S.S.U. offices where they may be
obtained any time during the rest of
the week.
Dancing on the night of the first
