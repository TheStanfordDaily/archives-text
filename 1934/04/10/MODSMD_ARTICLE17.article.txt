# S. S. Glencairn Is Nautical Play Sequence
## 
### 
Campus playgoers may witness an
unusual entertainment Thursday
evening in the dramatic reading of
Eugene O'Neill's play, "S.S. Glen
cairn." The presentation will be
given at 7:30 o'clock in the Little
Theatre.
When Eugene O'Neill wrote his
one-act play of the sea which have
been given the collective title of
"S.S. Glencairn," he was not com
pounding his plot and characters
from the figments of an imagination
leashed to an arm chair.
Widely Experienced
Before he became known to the
world as a playwright he led an ex
traordinary and difficult existence.
He contacted malaria fever during
a search for gold in Central America,
tended mules on a cattle steamer
from Buenos Aires to South Africa
and back, led a beachcomber's ex
istence in South America, and then
signed as ordinary seaman on a
British tramp steamer.
How much of his own experience
and observation is actually recorded
in the plays which compose "S.S.
Glencairn" —to be presented Thurs
day evening under Sword and San
dals' sponsorship—it is impossible to
say. At any rate, we may be certain
that O'Neill speaks with the author
ity of an intimate knowledge of the
existence he portrays.
Severe Critic
An apprentice when he wrote
these plays, O'Neill proves a severe
critic of ihem. He regrets the "thea
trical sentimentalism" of Smitty in
the fourth play "In the Zone" and
speaks most warmly of "The Moon
of the Carribbees." Of it he writes:
"In 'The Moon,' posed against a
background of that beauty, sad be
cause it is eternal, which is one M
the revealing moods of the sea's
truth, Smitty's silhouetted gestures
of self-pity are reduced to their
proper insignificance, his thin whine
of weakness is lost in the silence
which it was mean enough to dis
turb, we get the perspective to judge
him—and the others—and we find
his sentimental posing much more
out of harmony with truth, much
less in tune with beauty, than the
honest vulgarity of his mates."
