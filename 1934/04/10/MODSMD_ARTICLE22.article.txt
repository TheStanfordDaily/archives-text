# Card Diamond Team to Meet U.C. Nine Here
## Bears Hope to Cinch Title In Tilt This Afternoon At Sunken Diamond Wolter Hopes for Turning Of Tables on Bears 
### Mort D'Evelyn 
Hoping to cinch their already firm
grip on the 1934 Pacific Coast Inter
collegiate baseball title, California's
varsity ball nine journeys to the
Sunken diamond this aftei-noon to
face Harry Wolter's Card varsity at
3:15 o'clock.
Six weeks ago the situation was
somewhat similar. The Golden Bears
apparently had the basketball crown
all sewed up when an underdog In
dian five blasted their hopes in one
wild session, with U.S.C. getting the
championship as a result. Although
out of the running themselves, the
Card nine can now knock the props
out of Cal's first place standing, with
three games yet to be played be
tween the two teams.
Coach Wolter anticipates such a
come-through performance by the
Redshirts tomorrow, declaring that
"Stanford has as good a chance as
California to win"; this despite the
13-7 licking administered by the Cal
baseballers to Stanford but two
weeks ago. The Card mentor points
that his batters collected 10 hits off
the Bears in that loss and were
trimmed because of poor fielding,
which he considers much improved
with the revamped infield which
played for the Indians last week.

One of the big factors of a Stan
ford win, thinks Wolter, now that a
smooth field combination seems to
have been found, will be the clean
up hitting of Captain Dick Miles,
who has been in a slump during
the past 10 days.
To open the fray Wolter will call
on Stan Anderson, in the absence
of Fred Heringer *who was called
home Saturday by the death of his
brother. Anderson pitched some
masterful ball as a relief hurler in
the second U.S.C. and the St.
Mary's game last week and is by no
means unused to the Cal batters,
having chucked the first six in
nings of the initial game of the Cal-
Stanford series.
Peterson May Start
Opposing Anderson, Coach Clint
Evans of California will start Bill
Peterson or Lefty Hardt, a widely
hailed soph.
Behind the plate the Bears will
have h first-class field general in
Arleigh, who stepped off the grid
iron onto the diamond this winter
when Cal's long string of ace catch
ers seemed to have come to a close.
The other highlight of the Cal
lineup is likely to be George Relies,
a slugging right fielder who bats
clean-up and boasts a .428 average
at the plate during league games be
sides driving in 32 runs. Del Thom
son, third base, follows Relies to the
plate and is the Bears second most
consistent hitter, with Bill Hallauer,
short-stop and lead-off man, the
third.

Hoping to cinch their already firm
grip on the 1934 Pacific Coast Inter
collegiate baseball title, California's
varsity ball nine journeys to the
Sunken diamond this aftei-noon to
face Harry Wolter's Card varsity at
3:15 o'clock.
Six weeks ago the situation was
somewhat similar. The Golden Bears
apparently had the basketball crown
all sewed up when an underdog In
dian five blasted their hopes in one
wild session, with U.S.C. getting the
championship as a result. Although
out of the running themselves, the
Card nine can now knock the props
out of Cal's first place standing, with
three games yet to be played be
tween the two teams.
Coach Wolter anticipates such a
come-through performance by the
Redshirts tomorrow, declaring that
"Stanford has as good a chance as
California to win"; this despite the
13-7 licking administered by the Cal
baseballers to Stanford but two
weeks ago. The Card mentor points
that his batters collected 10 hits off
the Bears in that loss and were
trimmed because of poor fielding,
which he considers much improved
with the revamped infield which
played for the Indians last week.

One of the big factors of a Stan
ford win, thinks Wolter, now that a
smooth field combination seems to
have been found, will be the clean
up hitting of Captain Dick Miles,
who has been in a slump during
the past 10 days.
To open the fray Wolter will call
on Stan Anderson, in the absence
of Fred Heringer *who was called
home Saturday by the death of his
brother. Anderson pitched some
masterful ball as a relief hurler in
the second U.S.C. and the St.
Mary's game last week and is by no
means unused to the Cal batters,
having chucked the first six in
nings of the initial game of the Cal-
Stanford series.
Peterson May Start
Opposing Anderson, Coach Clint
Evans of California will start Bill
Peterson or Lefty Hardt, a widely
hailed soph.
Behind the plate the Bears will
have h first-class field general in
Arleigh, who stepped off the grid
iron onto the diamond this winter
when Cal's long string of ace catch
ers seemed to have come to a close.
The other highlight of the Cal
lineup is likely to be George Relies,
a slugging right fielder who bats
clean-up and boasts a .428 average
at the plate during league games be
sides driving in 32 runs. Del Thom
son, third base, follows Relies to the
plate and is the Bears second most
consistent hitter, with Bill Hallauer,
short-stop and lead-off man, the
third.
