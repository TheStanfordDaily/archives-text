# Union Profit Sinks Below Last Season
## Cellar, Stores Drop From Previous High 
### Crompton Bangs, Jr 
Everyone on the campus knows
where the Stanford Union is. Not
so many know what it is, how much
money it makes. The Union consists
of the dining rooms in the new
Union, the Cellar, the old and new
Union dormitories, and the Old
Union stores. The Women's Club
house is a separate unit.
The Stanford Union is run by a
board of seven governors, four of
whom are students. Every man stu
dent pays $1 a quarter in dues—
taken out of the community fees in
the well-known $114 checks. Last
year these came to over $7,000 —a
thousand less than in 1932.
Income Drops 20 Per Cent
Last year was a very bad one for
the Union. Total income from op
erations fell over 20 per cent—from
$230,000 to $183,000. This was pretty
evenly distributed. The Cellar took
in (37 thousand instead of 87 thou
sand; the store 43 instead of 57 thou
sand, etc. Contrary to the general
downward trend, the dormitories
took in $600 more than the year be
fore. This income drop was due
partly to fewer students spending
less money and partly to falling
prices for drugs, cigarettes, meals.
Expenses Cut Heavily
To meet the 20 per cent fall in in
come, expenses were slashed all the
way around—as much as a third in
some cases. But the overhead—in
cluding interest, breakage, deprecia
tion, etc., could be cut only $2,000
down to $28,000 last year.
The result was that all the units
showed a slight operating profit for
the year. But after pro-rating the
general overhead expenses to" each
according to its business volume, the
ice cream plant and the dormitories
showed profits of nearly $3,000 each.
On the other hand, the Cellar lost
over $5,000, while the stores and the
dining rooms were over $4,000 in the
red. Putting the profits and the
losses together, we get over $7,000
worth of red ink.
Dues Save the Day
But the $7,000 or more in dues
saved the day. With their hejp, the
Union ended the year with just $500
profit. With all the cuts, wages are
still way above most restaurant pay.
Fifty-lhree students and 30 non
students (mostly cooks, dishwashers,
etc.), work for the Union. This is
almost as many as in prosperous
1929.
Outlook Better
Now that 135 women eat regularly
in the Union, a steady income of $1
a day each is assured, The dining
room is doing as well as last year,
while the Cellar reports about 12
per cent more business than in 1932-
33, with the number of sales ap
proaching the 1929 level. Because 66
women instead of 100 roughs live in
the Union, dormitory income is
down, but only 10 per cent. All in
all, things are looking up for the
Union.
