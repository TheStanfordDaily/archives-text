# Senior Quad Support Lax
## 
### 
Unprecedented lack of senior sup
j port of the 1934 Quad was revealed
! yesterday by Business Manager Hal
I Whitfield.
Only 263 seniors out of a class of
| almost 700 members have as yet
i purchased the annual, which this
i year gives an unusually complete
j pictorial review of all events of im
l portance in activities of the college
j year. This is the lowest senior sale
j in the history of the Quad.
Since the Quad is primarily for
j the seniors as a permanent record
I of their final academic year, this lack'
of support is particularly to be cen
| sured, says Whitfield. Only a lim
! ited number of Quads have been
j ordered, so that seniors who wait
I until the final days to order their
| copy may find themselves unable to
i obtain one. Last year's book was a
i sellout.
Quad representatives will be in
front of the post office from 8-12
o'clock thus morning to take orders.
The price of the book is $5.65, or
$6.15 with a name engraved on the
cover. Seniors who have paid their
j dollar for their picture will have
j this deducted from their price.
