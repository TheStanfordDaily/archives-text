## New Document to Be Read Tonight to Members Of Ex Committee DEBATE NOT IN ORDER Eliminates Former A.W.S., W.A.A. Organizations 
### Frank Orr 
Awaiting final approval by the Ex
| Committee tonight, the A.S.S.U.'s
brand new constitution stands ready
for u student body vote to put into
! effect a new framework of govern
| ment.
Tonight's meeting will merely hear
' the document read, and since it has
! been checked several times by Dean
j Marion Kirkwood of the Law School
I and Professor Edwin Cottrell of the
| Political Science Department its cor
■ rectness should be unquestioned.
Ex Committee Powerful
Rejection of the present anti
j quated and inefficient constitution
! by .student voters will set in its place
1 a system of more clearly defined
I governmental powers, leaving to Ex
Committee discretion many matters
i now delegated to subordinate offi
| cers or left out altogether.
Foremost in the new setup will be
j consolidation of men's and woman's
| governments under the central A.S.
j S.U. office, eliminating the old A.
; W.S. and W.A.A. officers and com
| mittees. With an increasing femi
; nine enrollment, it was foreseen that
| separate administrations would re
| suit in overlapping and Confusion.
Next in importance are a number
| of clauses giving checking powers
I to the Administration, empowering
' the President and the deans to make
! several decisions as to appointment
| and removal of officers.
Low Grades Dangerous
The Administration also, wields a
i powerful axe in a rule that no stu
j dent who falls below a C average in
j any quarter may hold an elective or
! appointive office under the A.S.S.tJ.,
j its charters, or by-laws.
Strictly construed, this clause
J would bar from committees and pub
j lications student with a below-C
j average. Although a "probation" rule
| existed in the old constitution and
| has been invoked several times in
the past, the new form makes pos
sible rulings which might result in a
wholesale cleanup of campus activi
ties should the Administration wish
it.
Even with final adoption, the Con
i stitutional Revision Committee's
I work will have only begun. A prodi-
I gious list of by-laws and charters
! must be drawn for approval before
i May 1, the constitution provides,
j Work on these will begin immedia
tely, committeemen said.

Awaiting final approval by the Ex
| Committee tonight, the A.S.S.U.'s
brand new constitution stands ready
for u student body vote to put into
! effect a new framework of govern
| ment.
Tonight's meeting will merely hear
' the document read, and since it has
! been checked several times by Dean
j Marion Kirkwood of the Law School
I and Professor Edwin Cottrell of the
| Political Science Department its cor
■ rectness should be unquestioned.
Ex Committee Powerful
Rejection of the present anti
j quated and inefficient constitution
! by .student voters will set in its place
1 a system of more clearly defined
I governmental powers, leaving to Ex
Committee discretion many matters
i now delegated to subordinate offi
| cers or left out altogether.
Foremost in the new setup will be
j consolidation of men's and woman's
| governments under the central A.S.
j S.U. office, eliminating the old A.
; W.S. and W.A.A. officers and com
| mittees. With an increasing femi
; nine enrollment, it was foreseen that
