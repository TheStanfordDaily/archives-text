re: (tiling more than 20 of the best
teams in California in the third an
nul! Stanford Swimming
Relays in the Encina pools here Fri
day night.
Students will be admitted free to
the meet, which will start at S
('clock under specially installed
flood lights. It will be the first night
meet in the history of the Encina
tanks.
Coach Nort Thornton's Stanford
varsity is slightly favored to cap
lure the Class A title. However,
swimmers from the Olympic Club
and Lakeside Swimming Club prob
ably will offer serious competition.
California and the Athens Club will
carry away several places, but
neither team has shown much po
tentiality in a relay type of meet.
Y.M.C.A. Missing
11l the absence of the Y.M.C.A.
regulars, who are leaving for a na
lional meet in Chicago, the San
Francisco Y reserves are expected to
make a good showing.
The Winged-Q strong events are
the 400-yard free style, 400-yard
breast stroke, and 300-yard medley
relays. Lakeside counts on a victory
in the back stroke relay, and a place
in nearly every other event.
Cards Weil-Balanced
Stanford's favored position is de
rived from her power in the breast
stroke relay, 200-yard free style
event, and a score in each of the
other events.
The 400-yard relay should find
Stanford and the Winged-0 swim
mers matching stroke for stroke all
the way. Lakeside will combine with
this pair to make the last event of
the evening, the 300-yard medley
relay as close as any, with all of the
three teams claiming an even chance.
In Class B, there are no predomi
nate favorites, but the California
and Stanford*frosh, San Jose State,
Santa Maria J.C., and Menlo J.C.,
all will bid for the title.
Long Beach Strong
Long Beach High School, South
ern California title holders, loom
favorites to capture the Class C
prep school title. The southerners
will find difficulties, however, in the
. i ;ix-man 150-yard relay and in the
75-yard medley event. Long Beach
is favored in the 200-yard free style
event, breast stroke, and back stroke
relays.
Any of a group of Northern Cali
fornia prep entries, including Palo
Alto, Tamalpais, Berkeley, Stock
ton, Sequoia, and Santa Maria, may
upset the speedy southern team.
Most of these high school squads are
champions of their various sections.
