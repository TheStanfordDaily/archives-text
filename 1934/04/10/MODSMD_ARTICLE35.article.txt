## SECOND GAME OF HISTORIC SERIES 
### 
Meeting for the first time this sea
son on the Sunken diamond in the
second game of the year's historic
California-Stanford baseball series,
the Indians clash with the Bears here
today in an effort to stop the Berk
eleyans' drive for their second con
secutive pennant.
The series is replete with more
history and tradition than probably
any other similar one in the West,
although much of its tradition has
gone the way of many others and
been tossed into the discard.
The Stanford Axe, now famous
California-Stanford football trophy,
first became a symbol of athletic
hatred between the two schools in
1899, when some over-zealous Cali
fornians wrested it from a gi'oup of
Stanford students following a Bear
diamond victory in what was then
the Big Game.
