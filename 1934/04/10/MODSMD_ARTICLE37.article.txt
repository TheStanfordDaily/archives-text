With eight victories and one de
feat, California won the pennant
last year in a walk and is leading
the conference again this season
with only Stanford in her way. The
Beers have already defeated St.
Mary's five times, U.S.C. four times
out of five, and Stanford once in the
one game played.
Four games remain in the series
and California has to win but one of
them to clinch the title. With a large
margin of victory in favor of the
Berkeley team in the first game, this
might not seem so difficult but for
the fact that Stanford apparently
has taken a new lease on life, win
ning their last two games and bat
tling U.S.C. to a 13-inning tie in
anoth?r. â€”Tremaine
Pen State has two intercollegiate
wrestling champions on its 1934
squad.
