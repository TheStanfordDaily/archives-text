# BARES TRAINING FOR "BIG" MEET
## 
### 
With but a scant 11 days before
the annual "Big Little Meet" with
A1 Ragan's Cal frosh, Bill Ellington i
is training his yearlings with eyes j
to concentrate on the Bear weak
spots and pick up a few extra points I
in doubtful events. Entries in nonej
of the running events are positive '
yet, while the broad jump and pole
vault are open house, waiting for (
competent athletes.
The eligibility of Ernie Evans, '
frosh ace hurdler, which was a big 1
question mark last week, has been
cleared up and he will take his holes
against a sweet pair of Cal boys,
Gregory Stout and Jules Waddell, 1
who have improved constantly tfiis
year, meet by meet, running close to
24 flat in the lows and 15 flat in the
highs.
Bill McCurdy, who can break two
minutes flat in the 880 any time he
gets into shape, is still bothered with
a trick instep, and has not taken a \
hard workout for a fortnight. Un- j
less his foot will, permit running 1
soon, a couple of fast-improving
U.C. half-milers may outlast him for i
places behind Bob Alexander, the
dependable little Indian speeder, i
Ellington is working on a couple of
prospects trying to find a two-miler
who can cut under 10:25.
