When the Northern California
amateur tournament starts next Fri
day on the Orinda golf links, fifteen
Stanford men will be among the
field. The highest ranking on the
squad have all entered.
The entries as announced by
Coach Eddie Twiggs are Don Ed
wards, Jim and Dan Moser, Jack
Hoerner, Morse Erskine, Stewart
Hawley, Warren Munro, George
Berkey, Ed Beuter, "Mac" Stoddard,
Charles Deßrittville, Bob Thompson,
and Bill Hoelle.
The Northern California tourna
ment was won last year by Charlie
Seaver, former Cardinal star who
announced his intentions of return
ing to the bay region to defend his
title yesterday.
The tournament is definitely for
the good player and has no room for
tjhe dub; it is necessary to have a
handicap of under 14 to participate.
Of the Stanford men entering,
Jack Hoerner and Don Edwards have
the best chances to upset Seaver's
plans of»holding the title for a third
year. As they demonstrated in their
match last Friday they have about
equal talents and both shoot marve
lous golf when given half a chance.
At Stanford at the present time they
are handicapped a great deal by the
poor condition of the greens.
Contract bridge lessons are offered
in a Union course at Purdue Uni
versity.
