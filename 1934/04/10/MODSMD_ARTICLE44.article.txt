### 
j Ramming his charges into their 1
{ second week of an intensive eight
j week spring practice, Coach Tiny •
| Thornhill yesterday broke out with
j a series of new plays—"brain- j
| storms", as the sizeable mentor
| would put it. All started from the
! "B" formation, halfbacks on the
j flanks, fullback getting the pass from
I center, and the tackles on the long
j side of the line.
j Thornhill picked several teams to j
! run together, all consisting of men I
' who will be eligible next year. On i
his Number One team, Earl Hoos,
j was at quarter, Frank Alustiza j
| handling the ball at full, and Buck I
1 Van Dellen and Chuck White skirt- j
I ing the ends at half. In the line j
j were Keith Topping and Harold EI 1 - j
' der, ends, Bob Reynolds and Ed Let
i tunich, tackles, Woody Adams and i
j Larry Rouble, guards, and Alf Bran- I
I din at center.
Alustiza Shows Drive
Alustiza showed the drive that he j
exhibited several times last year in j
i tearing through guard on a fake re- j
verse, and both Van Dellen and j
j White took the ball and ran nicely, i
The Number Two eleven had Carl !
Schott and Lyle Smith, ends, j
Drown and Harry Carlson, tackles, j
Bob O'Connor and Dave Bardin, I
! guards, and Ralph Quails and Primo i
Pinotti alternating at center. In the [
backfield were Joe Vigna, Grigo Tur- I
| retto, Ken Prince, Chuck Clancy,
! Norm Ching, and Jack Rolls alterna- f
j ting.
