# Where Bleacher Coaches Point
## 
### 
Springtime's greatest campus sport reached a bit of
coastal intercollegiate prominence last Saturday when
Dean Cromwell's point-scoring machine from V.S.C. took
California down the line (as is their custom) by seven
points.
Stanford's bleacher coaches and track fans now talk
o! beating I'.S.C. and point to the difficulty the Trojans had
in winning at Berkeley. They reason that a close meet at
Berkeley shows a weak Trojan outfit and that they should
be handily defeated. But Dink Templcton and his track
team have more immediate meets to worry about.
Stanford once, last spring, set Troy back a bit and won
a meet. Dink hopes to repeat this a bit more decisively this
year, and about now is probably wondering whether or not
he can. '
But the bleacher coaches have overlooked a point. Be
fore any efforts against S.C., Stanford looks to the out
come of the Big Meet two weeks from now.
Troy, despite much screaming about injuries and de
pressing remarks about lack of material, finished on top
last Saturday. This procedure bus become almost habitual
with S.C. But lite Trojans did run up against some real
fight and power at Berkeley. l\C. took several events they
wcrn't expected to, and a seven-point margin last Saturday
spells no cinch for the Cardinals in two weeks.
Pointing for the Trojans because they beat us in the
second meet last year and because maybe Hables should
have had first in the hundred, is tine, but a bit inadequate
in view of the fight coming up against the Bears.
The team and l)infc are campaigners far too experi
enced to be guilty of such a mistake, but nevertheless track
fans may vicariously overemphasize the relative impor
tance of certain meets.
After all, when the track walls of Troy have been con
quered (inally, the cinder clash with California will still be
the Big Meet.
