# WHY IT'S NEWS
## Too Many Brains 
### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
Today Dr. Wirt goes before Con
' gress in Washington to name the
Red members of the Brain Trust.
The whole thing drags two of the
biggest bogey-men of the day out
into the open so everybody can look
at them. They are Communism and
Wall Street.
During the past year, whenever
opposition to the New Deal has
cropped up, the Democrats and
Progressives have trotted out their
monster â€” Wall Street, suggesting
that "big business" was trying to
sidetrack the New Deal. Now the
Republicans must have their fun, so
it is just tit for tat when the same
New Deal is branded as a Commu
nist plot hatched by Red college
professors.
No Unity in Either Group
As a matter of fact, neither of
these awesome monsters really ex
ists. Anybody who knows anything
about Wall Street knows that it is
hopelessly divided on everything
about the New Deal, and* other
things, too. To say that Wall Street
has one set policy is foolish. One of
the most frequent criticisms of big
business and finance has been that
it has had no leadership or policy
during the depression.
In its early days the Brain Trust
had a united purpose: to help
Mr. Roosevelt write his campaign
speeches. But that was about as far
as it went. Its present members are
certainly far from united on any
thing. Some of them, such as War
ren, are old-time conservatives; he
disagrees totally with all economic
planning.
Professor Tugwell believes in eco
nomic planning with all his heart
and soul. Professor Frankfurter is
a trust-buster who opposes large
corporate monopolies and wants
smaller businesses and more compe
tition. Therefore, he is'entirely at
variance with the other brain-trust
ers. Perhaps the biggest criticism of
the Brain Trust is that it is not co
ordinated, and that the program it
has drawn up is a hash of conflicting
policies.
Contradictory Policies
There is far more confusion than
conspiracy in Washington. For ex
ample, the AAA wants to bring farm
prices into line with those of manu
factured goods. But this is in direct
conflict with the NRA, which raises
the prices of manufactured goods,
leaving the farmer in the same hole
as before. The Federal Securities
Act, which kills investment, is in
direct conflict to the budget, which ,
depends largely upon a revival of
investment this year.
Apparently the trouble with the
Brain Trust is not Communism, but
disorganization. None of them have
a common conception of recovery.
Most of them have not though of the
relation between one policy and an
other. Result: confusion and contra
diction in the New Deal. As a con
sequence, F.R. has had no effective ;
sjroup to co-ordinate his policies. A
year ago, someone said: "Too many 1
cooks spoil the broth; too many
brains may spoil the New Deal." Wc
jre still wondering.
