# BULL SESSION
## SIC SEMPER BOLSHEVIKI 
### 
Despite official recognition of the
U.S.S.R., Russian rubles, and Anna
Stcn, America's No. one phobia, the j
"red menace," continues to pour ad
renalin into the national blood
stream. When news is scarce, and i
congressional activity is at low ebb,
communism has ever rushed into the
gap to raise newspaper circulation
and international headaches.
!
If time bombs and a Moscow-in
cited strike of congressmen do not
interfere, Dr. Wirt will testify today
in the nation's capital that "brain
trusters" are using Franklin Delano
Roosevelt as a capitalist tool to in
troduce in America a communist
state. The Washington gray-beards
and fuzzy-minds quake lest the ac
cusation be true. Here, at last, is a
real national issue!
We watch the good doctor. He
has just done his patriotic duty. He
has proved beyond shadow of a 1
doubt that Tugwell, Berle, Warren,
and Rogers are all communists. He
trembles with patriotic zeal. The ,
Bulwinkle committee is in an up
roar.
But what he is right? If the
brainy gentlemen of the Potomac
are convinced that the Roosevelt
band wagon must travel the Moscow i
road, is that cause for worry? Prob- j
ably not. If a red-tinted brain trust,
or a pink-tinted professor, or a greep
politician can bring national recov
ery, the nation will be satisfied. If
Tugwell actually gives the farmer
more dollars for his wheat, the
farmer will not complain if Mr. Tug
well thinks no one should 'have any
dollars. And if Roosevelt can give
big business bigger profits, big busi
ness will care little if Roosevelt in
wardly believes profits are evil. La
beled "communist" or "democrat,"
the Roosevelt policies mean just as
much or just as little. It is not
labels, but contents that count. Post
repeal whiskey has proved that.
There are some students who dis
believe anything that a professor
says, merely because he is a profes

sor. The majority are inclined to
swallow professorial dogma accord
ing to the same formula. But regard
less of whether an idea is promul
gated by a professor, a communist,
or a Dr. Wirt—it is the baloney and
not the wrapper that is nourishing.
What if Tugwell is a communist?

Bulwinkle committee is in an up
roar.
But what he is right? If the
brainy gentlemen of the Potomac
are convinced that the Roosevelt
band wagon must travel the Moscow i
road, is that cause for worry? Prob- j
ably not. If a red-tinted brain trust,
or a pink-tinted professor, or a greep
politician can bring national recov
ery, the nation will be satisfied. If
Tugwell actually gives the farmer
more dollars for his wheat, the
farmer will not complain if Mr. Tug
well thinks no one should 'have any
dollars. And if Roosevelt can give
big business bigger profits, big busi
ness will care little if Roosevelt in
wardly believes profits are evil. La
beled "communist" or "democrat,"
the Roosevelt policies mean just as
much or just as little. It is not
labels, but contents that count. Post
repeal whiskey has proved that.
There are some students who dis
believe anything that a professor
says, merely because he is a profes

sor. The majority are inclined to
swallow professorial dogma accord

less of whether an idea is promul
gated by a professor, a communist,
or a Dr. Wirt—it is the baloney and
not the wrapper that is nourishing.
What if Tugwell is a communist?

Despite official recognition of the
U.S.S.R., Russian rubles, and Anna
Stcn, America's No. one phobia, the j
"red menace," continues to pour ad
renalin into the national blood
stream. When news is scarce, and i
congressional activity is at low ebb,
communism has ever rushed into the
gap to raise newspaper circulation
and international headaches.
!
If time bombs and a Moscow-in
cited strike of congressmen do not
interfere, Dr. Wirt will testify today
in the nation's capital that "brain
trusters" are using Franklin Delano
Roosevelt as a capitalist tool to in
troduce in America a communist
state. The Washington gray-beards
and fuzzy-minds quake lest the ac
cusation be true. Here, at last, is a
real national issue!
We watch the good doctor. He
has just done his patriotic duty. He
has proved beyond shadow of a 1
doubt that Tugwell, Berle, Warren,
and Rogers are all communists. He
trembles with patriotic zeal. The ,
Bulwinkle committee is in an up
roar.
