| MYRA HESS
At the Veterans' Auditorium
That modern publicity methods dc
play some part in the reputation ol
| a musical artist is an unfortunate
' fact which was demonstrated last
Thursday night. Beyond all doubt,
j Myra Hess is one of the greatest
, contemporary pianists, even though
| most of the world seems unaware of
| the fact.
There was no artistic sham about
| her; she sat down before the piano
I as a stenographer before a type
i writer, doing what was given her to
, do without adding anything super
fious. Miss Hess let the composer
; speak for himself, merely acting as
j a perfect medium of communication.
| If she put her own "interpretation"
, on what she played, she did it so
1 well that the audience felt that it
| was the contposer speaking.
Her program was entirely of Bach
and Brahms—a critic would call it a
heavy program and a difficult one.
| For Bach on the piano seems to lose
j the richness that it has in orchestral
j transcription, and Brahms is always
] likely to prove difficult. But no one
j who heard Miss Hess play them
! would believe it. The firmness, di
i rectness, and clarity of her playing
, gave to the Bach a fullness which
I one seldom hears, especially in the
| lower registers. Here sureness of
j attack did not degenerate into mere

pounding of the piano for effect a
fault far too common. And precision
r.ever was carried too far, lor her
clarity of tone never became too
crisp.
Brahms benefited even more by
this approach. Brahms is compli
cated, and in very many cases thys
complexity i.s not resolved into sim
plicity, but merely becomes a group
of vaguely connected melodies which
produce a haze of tone. But Miss
Hess's clarity gave to Brahms thai
same unity and seeming simplicity
that a Bach fugue has.
I dislike to talk of technique as
such. Sufficient to say, Miss Hess
has it in abundance, but never al
lows more of it to show than is nec
essary. She is content with conceal
ing the difficulty passages, and of
making her tone so perfect that one
is not aware of its perfection.
The choice of program was far
too good to escape commendation.
It was completely unified, and did
not throw out anything approaching
saccharine soup. This generalization
applies even to the encores.
