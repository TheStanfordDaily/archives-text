# ROTHERT REPORTS ALUMNI CONCLAVE VERY SUCCESSFUL
## 
### 
Back yesterday after heading a
delegation of Stanford faculty,
Alumni Secretary Harlow Rothert
reported lliat the alumni conference
held Saturday in Los Angeles was
far more of a succcss than the most
optimistic predictions.
More than 500 graduates convened
in the University Club to participate
in the discussions held during the
afternoon and to listen to talks by
Dr. Wilbur, Judge Ben Bledsoe, and
Professor Kreps of the School of
Business. This number was 100 more
than the number attending the pro
gram when it was given here last
month.
World Affairs Talk
Dr. Wilbur covered the world in
his opening talk, and was enthu
siastically received by the alumni.
Among other things he discussed the
importance of the plastic nature of
youth in the Nazi and Fascisti move
ments. Then turning to more do
mestic subjects, he told his audience
that more money should be spent
on education, but that he opposed a
central control of education in Wash
ington.
The conferences that followed
were the same as those at the con
ference here, and led by the same
faculty members, with the excep
tion of Professor Arthur Cathcarts
discussion on the N.R.A. Professor
George Dowrie repeated his discus
sion twice, with a total of over 200
participating. The discussion by
Professor E. A. Cottrell on the New
Deal and Local Governments
aroused a great deal of interest
among the southern alumni.
Bledsoe Talks
Rothert was master of ceremonies
at the banquet that closed the af
fair, and introduced former Judge
Bledsoe, a Stanford graduate, who
told the audience in his talk that he
strongly favored American entrance
into the World Court. Professor
Theodore Kreps of the School of
Business repeated his talk on Re
covery.
The program was counted such a
success, according to Rothert, that it
is planned to make it a regular
yearly affair, following the plan al
ready adopted for the conference on
the campus.
Leaders in the south who helped
make Saturday's meeting run
smoothly were Jack Cooper and
Pauline Hoffman, presidents of the
Stanford Men's and Women's Clubs;
Homer Steiny, secretary of the Men's
Club; Sylvia Weaver Smith, and
Rosamund Clarke.
