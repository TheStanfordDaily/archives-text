# U.C. WINS OVER STANFORD, 4-2, TO CINCH TITLE
## Stan Anderson Given Poor Co-operation in Close Pitching Battle BEARS WIN ON ERRORS California Nine Tallies 3 Runs in Second 
### 
Stun Anderson, hefty Indian right
hander, lost a tough pitchers' battle
to Sophomore Lefty Hardt of the
Golden Bears yesterday afternoon in
the Sunken Diamond as California
gained a 4 to 2 decision over Stan
ford in the second game of the an
nual series. Yesterday's win means
the Coast Intercollegiate crown for
Clint Evans' men and their eleventh
win of league play.
Poor support for the masterful
pitching game played by Anderson
cost the Cards their second defeat
at the hands of the Berkeley nine
this year. On paper Anderson had
the Bears licked, holding them down
to five hits and being responsible
for but one of the four runs scored.
Anderson Plays Well
Besides, the big chucker struck
out seven Bear batsmen and walked
four, the only department in which
Hardt of the Bears can claim a bet
ter record; he gave only two free
trips to first base.
Anderson not only gave U.C.
plenty of trouble from the pitchers'
box but collected a double and a
long triple, driving in one run and
scoring another himself in his trip a
to the plate.
Three Runs in 20 Minutes
Cal won the game in the first half
of the second inning when they took
advantage of Stanford errors and
drove three runs across the plate.
Thompson, third sacker, scored first
when Grilk doubled to left center.'
Sparling was safe on Mallatratfs
error, and Grilk, who stole third,
crossed the plate when Hamilton
dropped Williams' fly. Lefty Hardt's
single scored the third Cal man,
Sparling.
Stanford's runs were due to a long
double to right by Anderson, scor
ing Mallatratt, and a single by Art
Hearn, who sent Anderson home
following the latter's triple.
