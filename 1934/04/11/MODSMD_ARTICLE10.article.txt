day s Daily condemning the unjust attitude toward minor sports, revealed
closely balanced factions.
Dissatisfaction of sports leaders with present glorification of major sports
and overshadowing of so-called "minor" athletic activities, seems to be
strong. Other commentators, although considering- the present setup faulty,
lefused to approve the Daily's proposal to place all sports on the same
footing.

Statements of interested athletes
and coaches follow:
Harry Wolter, varsity baseball
coach: "The minor sports men put
forth just as much effort, and spend
j equally as much time on their activ
! ity as do major sport men. There's
no doubt about it." »
Bunn Opinion
J John Bunn, varsity basketball
coach: "The editorial misses the
point as to what basis is used in
determining the difference between
major and minor sports. Division is
made from the standpoint of gen
eral interest, number of participants,
and spectators. It is not based on
financial returns."
Bob Clark, swimmer and water
I poloist: "I don't think there should
be any distinction between sports.
Whether major or minor, the players
! work equally as hard."
Pro and Con
I A1 Snyder: "Aside from the ne
! cessity of giving a Block 'S' cards
! to an enormous number of students,
if all sports were placed on the same
basis, there should be no under-
I estimating of minor sports."
Harry Maloney, minor sports di
; rector: "In my 26 years at Stan
i ford, I have previously come across
J only one instance of dissatisfaction
1 over the major-minor sports classi
! fication."
Chuck Otis, tennis captain: "I be-
J lieve there should be a distinction
; on the basis of recognition, the gain
| for the school, the number partici
j pating, and the general interest
i aroused."
