# New Theatre Needed As Benefit to Campus Stars

### ANNALEE WHITMORE 
Stanford's drive for a new campus
theatre gained further impetus yes
terday as Director Harold Helven
ston stressed the nation-wide im
portance of comparatively unher
alded and unsung drama graduates.
Products of Helvenston's tutelage
occupy positions of importance in
the movies, stock, as instructors, and
every conceivable phase of dramatic
work. If such success can be at
tained with the outmoded and in
adequate equipment now available,
"what," query officials, "could we
do with a modern, fully-equipped
theatre?"
To mention only a few of the many
local products "making good": Bar
bar;! Collins is scoring a hit in a Los
Angeles stock company, while Val
lejn Gantner, well known to students
for his interpretation of the leading
roles in "Death Takes a Holiday"

I and "Berkeley Square," is playing
in Syracuse, New York.
Tom Henry, another recent grad
uate, has already earned the posi
tion of instructor at U.C.L.A., and is
, connected with the Community
' Playhouse.
One prominent graduate, Kathleen
Fitts, appeared in several San Fran- |
cigeo plays. Fellow members of the j
then-"soo'' oh-ed and ah-ed at her
performance with Ina Claire in ' Re
union in Vienna," a direct contrast :
jto her less classic reputation as
! campus songster.
These alumni have risen to promi
nence because of Stanford training, j
According to Hfelvenston, students j
now enrolled possess equally great
lability, and with the advantage of 1
| better equipment, could attain even
i greater heights.
Stanford needs a theatre!
