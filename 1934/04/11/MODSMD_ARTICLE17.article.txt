# Bids Sold For Ball As Ruler Contest Opens
## Twenty Campus Favorites Enter Final Race For King and Queen "Go to Hell" Say Rally men As Inferno Nears 
### Dorothy Sweet 
Well over 100 Masque Ball bids
were sold yesterday. The remaining
ducats are available today in the
A.S.S.U. office at the low price of
$2.50. Rally Committee states that
it is not responsible if there is an
early sellout. Since the number of
bids is limited, it is best to get them
now.
The slogan, "Take your ladies to
Hades!" the Masque Ball byword,
has a real meaning. In fact, the
Masque Ball is going to be "HeU"
this year, when courageous couples
are presented at the court of Me
phistopheles. Speculation of the cam
pus is rife as to who King Satan
and his Fire Queen will be.
"Hell" Is Motif
In other words, the theme of the
Masque Ball is to be "Hell." For
the first time in Masque Ball his
tory the dance will have a definite
motif, carried out to the full extent
by decorations covering the entire
building.
The 10 most popular male con
testants for the coveted post of King
Satan are as follows: Stan 'Aces"
Anderson, Chuck "Brassie" de
Bretteville, Dante "Prettyboy" Lem
bi, John "Hairy" Lipscomb, John
"Goody" Lyman, Monk "Clark Ga
ble" Moscrip, John "Elm Cottage"
Mottram, Wes "Bubbles" Muller,
Malcolm "Mink" Tarpey, and Jimmy
"Kappa" Triolo.
The 10 campus women who, by
winning Monday's election, stand a
chance of being crowned Fire Queen
are listed in alphabetical order:
Betty "Rah Rah" Ballachey, Anne
"Whoops" Bracket, Mallou "Call
Me" Dobbs, Jeanette "Fool's" Gould,
Eleanor "Hey Hey" Harris, Fritzi
"Hello" Kolster, Betty "Slinger" Ly
man, Natalie "Hula" Tatum, Ka
trina "Get Rich Quick" Walling
ford, and Peg "Leg" Worden.
Costumes Available
From Monday until Friday of next
week, costumes for the Ball will be
available on the campus, so that it
will not be necessary for students
to go to San Francisco. A little in
genuity, however, will save money
and still give the Masque Ball goers
a good time.
Accompanied by a number of
startling surprises, the names of the
Masque Ball orchestra will be an
nounced tomorrow. It will number
15 players plus five extra vocalists.
A Stanford man's latest gag is to
phone his favorite sorority every
night and invite the women who
answers the phone to "go to Hell."
