# 700 New Trees Planted To Fill Bare Arboretum
## 
### 
To replenish the rapidly increas
ing bare spaces in the Stanford Ar
boretum occupying the vast terri
tory between the quadrangle and
the highway, nearly 700 young trees
were set out during the spring va
cation.
A large number of trees have died
from lack of water during the last
few years. These include for the most
part redwoods, pines, cypress, and
eucalyptus trees.
Among the new trees added to the
arboretum were 140 oaks, 150 pep
per trees, 65 casurinas, 127 acacias of
different varieties, 80 English laurels,
54 Toyons, and 54 Pyracantha Ju
nenseis, the last being a shrub.
Since the water from Lagunita is
used for irrigation purposes any
large amount of watering during dry
periods cuts down the water sports
of the campus, reports Carl Maier of
the Stanford Herbarium. It is partly
lor this reason that the trees have
lacked for water, he said.
