### FRANK ORR 
A special election Tuesday will determine the fate of the new A.S.S.U.
constitution, it was voted by the Ex Committee at its meeting last night.
To appear in the Daily tomorrow and Friday in its entirety, the new
document will go to a test at the polls to determine whether or not the new
organization meets with general approval, and whether or not the Consti
tution Revision Committee shall proceed with drawing up by-laws and
charters to be approved separately.

â–º John Lyman, A.S.S.U. vice-presi
dent, was the only member voting
negatively on the question of an
! election. Lyman said he opposed the
constitution's provision for the se
lection of prospective sponsors by a
three-man committee, and also took
exception to the fact that no further
public hearings would be heard be
fore the election.
Some objection was raised on the
, grounds that the constitution was
i being "railroaded through," but since
committee meetings had been an
nounced and open to the public ap
proval was given.
Donation of $12.50 toward per
