# Needed— One Enlightened Attitude
## 
### 
The I).\rr.Y's recent editorial comment favoring aboli
tion of the distinction between major and minor sports
awards met with a storm of comment from sports leaders
on tho campus. Opinions are mixed, and two camps have
appeared.
The Daily commends those progressive sportsmen who
show a clear understanding of the true value and purpose
of an athletic award. Some few see the Block "S" in its
true light—not as a symbol of heroism or fame, but rather
as a recognition of athletic endeavor, the amount of work
done by a man to become proficient in the sport which
interests him most.
From the opposing camp further arguments have been
advanced against removing the Circle <V S" "brand" from
the minor sportsmen. It has been said that minor sports
get the "culls" from the major sports, the men who aren't
good enough for the major sports. Men in minor sports
resent this proposition, and rightly so. They are out for
sports called "minor" just because they happen to be more
interested in them.
Some Eastern universities already have taken a pro
gressive step and moved to eliminate all differences in
awards and recognition of various sports.
Harry Wolter, coaching baseball, a major sport, agrees
with the Daily's basic argument and emphasizes the fact
that all athletes, in all sports, major or minor, work just
as hard and just as long, in order to represent the Univer
sity in intercollegiate competition.
Little mention has been made of what the Daily has
supposed to be the chief reason for differentiation between
the fields of endeavor. None of those who feel that the
system should remain unchanged have felt that the cost of
financing the sport should be a point in governing its
status.
All feel that more people are interested in major sports
than in those called minor. This is true to a certain extent.
More fans follow football than golf, and basketball draws
bigger crowds than water polo.
But that is only one side. Swimming, a minor sport,
consistently draws greater crowds than tennis. Rugby and
boxing outrank baseball in point of interest.
But even the supporters of the status quo feel that the
interest is the result of the fact that the sport is called
major, that the interest is not the cause of the classification
of the sport as a major one, and that lacking such classi
fication, interest in the sport might be considerably less.
The Daily watches the progress of the controversy with
much interest, and hopes that an enlightened dttitude to
ward athletic awards can be definitely established in an
enlightened academic institution .
The matter can be adjusted now coincidental to the
revision of the by-laws of the A.S.S.U. constitution. Defi
nite action along progressive lines should be taken.
