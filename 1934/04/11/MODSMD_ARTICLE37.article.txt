When llic Ex Committee named two registered students
lo serve on the newly formed Commission for Student: Aid
I;isI night, Stanford moved forward one more step in the
administration of funds for her many students in need of
a helping hand.
Formerly, all student aid has been handled by a faculty
committee which was responsible for anv loans or other
aid. Beginning today, the student members will express
the will of the Associated Students in the handling of these
matters. The new commission will name the students who
shall receive assistance, decide how long they may benefit
thereby, and the maximum amount that they shall get.
The main point for consideration right now lies in the
fact that friendly alumni and others who contribute to the
commission's fund for self-supporting students will be as
sured, now more than ever, that their help will be going
lo those who deserve it most. It is well that the University
had the foresight to request the Associated Students lo
join with the faculty and alumni in this enterprise, and the
Daily looks forward to the efficient, fair development of
present plans.
