# WHY IT'S NEWS
## Bucking the President 
### CROMPTON BANCS Jr 
A year ago President Roosevelt
had the almost unanimous support
of Congress and the country. He
had a program for recovery; nobouy
else had, and there was little oppo
sition. This worried the New Deal
ers, for there was no check on then
activities. Sooner or later when op
position did develop, it would be all
the stronger and more influential
simply because the New Deal had
grown up when there wasn't any.
Opposition to the Roosevelt pro
gram has been getting stronger and
stronger every day. What measures
have been opposed and who is op
posing them?
The Things Opposed
No. 1 item is the stock market
regulation bill. The Administration
firmly believes the government must
regulate the issuance and sale of
stocks and bonds if its program is to
succeed. Financial interests are just
as firmly opposed to the whole idea
of Federal regulation. They backed
up their opposition with money and
the most impressive lobby in Wash
ington. Result: Senate Banking
Committee took the heart out of the
bill and F.R. suffered a major defeat.
No. 2 item is the greatly improved
team-work of the inflationary, there
fore anti-economy, anti-F.R. forces
in Congress. The Democratic leaders
of the House are openly supporting
a bill to pay off alt depositors in all
closed national banks. Total cost:
two billion. This is being dftne in
spite of outspoken Roosevelt dis
approval.
Another bill with plenty of sup
port in the Middle West would issue
greenbacks (paper money) against
farm mortgages. This being an elec
tion year, both have a fair chance
of passing, though F.R. is sure to
veto them.
Strange Bedfellows
Politics often produces strange
bedfellows. Here is the present line
up of the anti-Roosevelt forces: (1)
The Conservatives of the Republican
Farty as a rallying point; (2) most
stock and bond men and most of the

larger banks; (3) the inflationist
Democratic Committee for the na
tion; (4) The American Legion and
patriotic societies generally â€” they
tear communism; (5) large and
small industrialists who think there
is too much government in busi
ness, too much NRA red tape; (6)
lots of farm organizations (mostly
radical ones) opposed' to the AAA.
.... But Not for Long
Most New Dealers think these
teammates will soon fall out. They
wonder how conservative bankers,
radical farmers, inflationists, and
Legionnaires can stick together.
They expect F.R. to appeal directly
to the country over the radio for the
support of the great mass of unor
ganized citizens against the growing
pressure of sectional and business
interests on Congress. It worked be
fore, it may work again. Still this is
an election vear.
