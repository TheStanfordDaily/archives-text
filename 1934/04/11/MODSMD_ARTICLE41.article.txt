# BULLSESSION
## TWO BUSTS FOR STANFORD 
### 
Stanford has gone for statuary. We
] know of but two places where there
| are more frozen faces—the Louvre
j and the British Museum. In marble
1 and in sandstone, the campus is lit
tered with all manner of carved
things, from cherubs to college pro
-1 lessors. A few hearts and flowers
have been thrown in to -lend beauty
and vigor to the domestic scene.
But aside from a knowing quirk
which we once noticed in the right
i eye of the middle sandstone ogre
who guards the Library, the whole
collection has made Stanford seem
more and more like a graveyard,
i which no one believes it is. Of j
i course, statues are meant to be in
spiring. And there is something
very elevating about dust-covered
alabaster and guano-spotted sand
i stone. Still a marble smile, or even
j » sandstone snicker, can be just as
| inspiring as a series of frowns and
miscellaneous wrinkles. If we must
have statuary, why not make it in
teresting?
There are two remaining locations
! fo* statues on the Quad —the empty- 1

wreathed pedestals above the Engi- ,
neering and Geology corners. They
must be filled soon; who will the 1
administration honor with these
places of perpetual glory?
For alabaster immortality above
the Geology corner, we nominate
"Pop" Warner, who probably collec- ,
ted more rocks and mud than any
Stanford man since President Bran
ner. But the "Old Fox" must be
made real; he will wear a slouch
cap; and a cigarette will hang from
his lips.
On the Engineering Corner's ped
estal must sit a Pi Phi, perhaps
"Speedball" Hewlett, who has engi
neered more Masque Ball queen- j
ships than any woman in Stanford
history. This would forever destroy 1
the myth that an engineer must be j
a monk, and carry a slide-rule next |
to his heart.
By all means the two twists must
be in pure white alabaster; also, the \
swallows have returned.
