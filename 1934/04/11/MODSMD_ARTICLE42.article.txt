QUEEN CHRISTINA (MGM) |
J At Blanco's Mountain View Theatre
The return of Greta Garbo to the
. screen is accompanied by all the !
! pomp and -circumstance which the
j fan magazines and the press agents i
| have led one to expect.
The Swedish phenomenon appears
J in the role of the strange Queen
Christina of Sweeden, and the story
| revolves around her love for the \
' Spanish ambassador, her surrender
of the throne, and the subsequent j
death of her lover. The plot is dra
j matic and exciting, and suspense is
well sustained.
J Director Rouben Mamoulain, evi
; dently a devotee of the idea of "art
for Garbo's sake," has given the ,
; film a beautiful production, and has !
! been particularly adroit in his han
; dling of crowds. But there is a good
deal of what can be described only
i as hokum, as in the farewell to the
inn, the abdication of the throne, and
! the monstrously dramatic finale.
The star's support is normally J
good, except for Lev/is Stone, who
i gives his usual sterling performance,
| and John Gilbert, who offers un
doubtedly the outstandingly feeble
performance of the year.
: But obviously it is Garbo's show,
; and she gives a sincere and work
-1 manlike interpretation of the Queen,
! one which is at once forceful and [
' sympathetic. But it will not appeal i
'as the performance par excellence i
of the age—unless you happen to be
a Garbomaniac, in which case you
will sit back in a diffused glow and
mutter happily to yourself, "God- I
issniswunnerful? : ' —Chapin

1 YEHUDI MENUHIN
At the Civic Auditorium
Last year Yehudi Menuhin offered
San Francisco a feast by playing
three of the greatest violin 'concer
tos in one program. Sunday's three
' concertos represented as great an
expenditure of energy and were as i
well received; only they were not

such good concertos.
The first was an unknown work
by Mozart, composed at the age of
10. Aside from the fact that it is
music of a high order, it is interest
ing as presenting ' slightly different
Mozart, before he achieved that per
fection of line which enabled him to
write a series of masterpieces so
flawless that that itself is a flaw. In
other words, this concerto shows !
Mozart as a human being interested ;
in human beings.
The Lalo Symphonie Espagnole is
too familiar to need much comment.
It is not great music, but is in many
places delightful, especially in the
warm interpretation that was given
it.
The third concerto was a Paganini
work which has recently been res- i
cued from a not undeserved ob
scurity. It has its points: Paganini
has several unusual and beautiful
themes, but no idea of developing
them. Instead he sends both or
chestra and violin into acrobatics,
and mars, if not entirely loses, the '
aesthetic effect. The most promi
nent feature of the work is the ex- (
treme difficulty of the violin pas
sage, especially one cadenza (which
the program informs me was written i
by Emile SaUret) which is almost
inhuman. I can only add that Ye
hudi's flawless playing, his firmness
and precision, were wasted. Yehudi
Menuhin is too well established to
have to spend one-third of an after
noon showing off his technique.
Yehudi's playing is almost beyond
criticism. There is no talk of haunt
ing, mystic tones; his expression is
direct, forceful, and a statement
complete in itself. All he lacks is
the reserved warmth which it'took
Kreisler almost 50 years to acquire.
