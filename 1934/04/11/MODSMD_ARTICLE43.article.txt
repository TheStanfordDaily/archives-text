Even having a judge for a
father didn't help one Stanford
senior yesterday, when she had
to contribute her share to Judge
J. E. Springer's collection of
traffic fines in Palo Alto.
She was Frances Bledsoe,
who was on her way to Los
Angeles for Easter vacation, but
unfortunately drove through
Palo Alto on her way, and still
more unfortunately attracted
Officer Paul Bishop's attention
for driving just a little too fast.
Yesterday she appeared be
fore Judge Springer, handed
him a check from her father,
who has been both a Federrll
and State judge. A letter was
enclosed, commending the of
ficer who arrested her, just to
make things worse. But then,
it's still papa who pays.
