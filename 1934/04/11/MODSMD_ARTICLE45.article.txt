# Booth, Friedman to Compete for Cards
## SWIMMING MEET TO FEATURE FOUR DIVING CHAMPIONS 
### 
A diving treat sui'passing any on
the Pacific Coast in several years
will be offered as a special event in
the third annual Stanford Univer
sity Swimming Relays, scheduled
for 8 o'clock Friday night in the En
cina pools.
In addition to the leading Colle
giate divers on the Coast this year,
Coach Nort Thornton of the Stan
ford Cards, who is handling ar
rangements for the affair, has ar
ranged for four other outstanding
spring-board artists.
Ed Throndson, former Stanford
captain and 1930 National Inter
collegiate diving champion, heads
this parade of talent. He teamed
with Pete Des Jardines, .world's
champion, in 1930 to put on the
greatc-st diving exhibition yet seen
at Stanford, and his appearance here
Friday promises to add real class to
ihe meet.
Rufus Rucker, California star and
present Pacific Coast Intercollegiate
diving champion, will be on hand to
press the former champion, as will
Elton Stone of the Fairmont Swim
ming Club, present Pacific Associa
tion champion.
Dick Heating, another Fairmont
star, and Danny Kuhns, sensational
California freshman who won the
event in the Northern California
Team Championship program at
Lakeside several weeks ago, have
already proved their merits, and
either may press or even upset the
highly-touted Throndson and Ru
cker.
Stanford's diving entries will in
clude Tom Boothe and Milt Fried
man, rapidly developing sophomores.
An added attraction to the bounc
ing board event will be the appear
ance of Clyde Diaz of the Olympic
Club, world famous comedy diver,
will draw many laughs by his antics.
He has appeared at all of the big
San Francisco meets and is claimed
to be one of the outstanding comedy
divers in the country.
Negotiations are under way to
secure the services of Mickey Riley,
winner of the 1932 Olympic Games.
Riley, a U.S.C. alumnus, recently
turned professional, and he may not
be permitted to enter.
