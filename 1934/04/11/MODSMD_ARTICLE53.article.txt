WHAT MAKES
A CHAMPION?
Just what makes champs has been
the subject of controversy ever since
champs existed. Here's some facts
on a current champion which may
not be conclusive but are eloquent
anyway: Bob Keisel, Cal's ace sprin
ter, ran a 9.5 century last Saturday,
a 7.6 75-yard dash two weeks ago,
and a 20.8 furlong' a week earlier.
The Bear dashman is ranked to
day with Ralph Metcalfe as fhe peer
of American sprinters and many are
looking for him to crack the unof
ficial world 220-yard dash mark of
20.4 held unofficially by the great
negro.
FOWLER HOLDS
GOOD TWO-MILE MARK
One of the best track marks on the
Coast this season is the 9:39 two-mile
run by the California sophomore,
Bob Fowler. It is within a second
of the ancient Big Meet record held
jointly by Hank Coe and Spud Moss
man, the latter a much-heralded
sorrel-topped Bear who ran several
years ago. Another indication of
the excellence of the mark is the
fact that Fowler made it while run
ning indoors for the first time and
on a small track which forced him
to make twice the usual number of
turns.
TOUGH LUCK
FOR S.C., CAL.
Stanford's two greatest track ri
vals, California and U.S.C., seem to
be getting more than their share of
hard luck this year, at least that's
what is claimed before the Cards
run up against the two teams.
There is the case of a promising
•California sophomore middle dis
tance runner, Pat Harrold, who was
ineligible at the beginning of the
year because of poor grades. Brutus
Hamilton heralded him at that time
as a better looking prospect at that
stage of his career than was Glenn
Cunningham, who recently set a new
mile mark and Hamilton should
know because he coached Cunning
ham. The soph finally made the
scholastic grade, ran a 4:35 practice
mile, and then decided to hang up
his spikes!
Injuries have hit both teams. Stan
Williamson, who was expected to
throw the javelin well over 200 feet,
now isn't even sure of throwing at
all. With Cal's sophomore Fitzger
old suffering an arm injury, two of
the Coast's best spear hurlers are
incapacitated.
FROSH SENSATONS
MAKE GREAT RECORDS
But at S.C. they have no need to
worry over next year when they
watch Bill Sefton, a pole vaulter
who has done 14 feet; Phil Cope and
Staley, who have done the highs in
15 flat and 15.2, and if plans work
out, these frosh stars will be joined
by Cornelius Johnson and Thurber,
both six-foot-six high jumpers.
And over at Cal there is a frosh
sprinter, George Anderson, who has
done the 100 often under 10 fiat, last
Saturday in 9.7, and has come close
to 21 in the 220. —D'Evelyn
