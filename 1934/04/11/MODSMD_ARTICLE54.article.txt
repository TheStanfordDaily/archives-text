1 ime Clock, one of the three named for the Kentucky derby by
Mrs. Dodge Sloane's Brookmeade stable, came into prominence when
he won the $10,000 Florida oerby at Hialeah park this winter. A son
of On Watch, he campaigned lightly as a two-year-old but made rapid
strides forward during the winter months under the training of Bob
Smith. (Associated Press Photo)
