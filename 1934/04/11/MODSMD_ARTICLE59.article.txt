# "BLAZING" BEN WILL RUN AT OLYMPIC CLUB MEET
## 
### 
In order to get a little more com
petition under their belts before the
Big Meet with California just 10
days away, Coach Dink Templeton's
track and field aces face a team of
Olympic Club veterans, coached by
Charley Hunter, this Saturday aft
ernoon on Angell*Field.
An outstanding feature of the con
test will be the first competitive
appearance in many weeks of Ben
Eastman, Stanford's greatest middle
distance star, in the half-mile as a
Winged-O performer against his for
mer teammates.
Eastman was slated to compete in
the all-University meet on March
10, but an ailing leg muscle pre
vented his entrance. The former
Card captain is recovered now and
he promises once more to be the
"Blazing" Ben that made so much
Stanford track history.
Eastman's appearance will not be
the only feature of the meet, how
ever. In the mile run, Chuck Nim
mo, slender soph star of the Cards,
meets those two fine Olympians,
Clai'ence Hoist and Norm Bright,
both of whom he defeated in the
all-University meet of a month ago.
Fans may remember that little
"Chuck" had a two-yard lead and
was clocked in 4 minutes 22.9 sec
onds in their first encounter. Both
Hoist and Bright have been training
diligently for the past several days
and undoubtedly will give all they
have in an attempt to turn the tables
on the Stanford star.
Saturday's engagement also offers
another opportunity for John Mott
ram, Templeton's greatest javelin

product, and Ed Waterbury, former
California star, to renew their com
petition in the spear event. The last
time the two young fellows met, all
that Mottram did was to set a new
Stanford record of 220 feet 10 J /2
inches by throwing the oversized
toothpick clear over the javelin en
closure on Angell Field. Waterbury
has a mark of well over 200 feet
made this season and when these
two stars get together records mean
nothing at all.
In the sprints, Carl Thorns, sensa
tional Stanford star, and Abe Ha
bles, former Card performer now
competing for the Olympic Club,
promise to again renew their dual
for supremacy. Thorns at present
holds decisions in both dashes over
his more experienced rival by vir
tue of his victories in the all-Univer
sity contest. If Hables manages to
get into shape and recover com
pletely from a bothersome cold,
Thorns will have all he can com
fortably handle Saturday.

"Chuck" had a two-yard lead and
was clocked in 4 minutes 22.9 sec
onds in their first encounter. Both
Hoist and Bright have been training
diligently for the past several days
and undoubtedly will give all they
have in an attempt to turn the tables
on the Stanford star.
Saturday's engagement also offers
another opportunity for John Mott
ram, Templeton's greatest javelin

product, and Ed Waterbury, former
California star, to renew their com
petition in the spear event. The last
time the two young fellows met, all
that Mottram did was to set a new
Stanford record of 220 feet 10 J /2
inches by throwing the oversized
toothpick clear over the javelin en
closure on Angell Field. Waterbury
has a mark of well over 200 feet
made this season and when these
two stars get together records mean
nothing at all.
In the sprints, Carl Thorns, sensa
tional Stanford star, and Abe Ha
bles, former Card performer now
competing for the Olympic Club,
promise to again renew their dual
for supremacy. Thorns at present
holds decisions in both dashes over
his more experienced rival by vir
tue of his victories in the all-Univer
sity contest. If Hables manages to
get into shape and recover com
pletely from a bothersome cold,
Thorns will have all he can com
fortably handle Saturday.
In order to get a little more com
petition under their belts before the
Big Meet with California just 10
days away, Coach Dink Templeton's
track and field aces face a team of
Olympic Club veterans, coached by
Charley Hunter, this Saturday aft
ernoon on Angell*Field.
An outstanding feature of the con
test will be the first competitive
appearance in many weeks of Ben
Eastman, Stanford's greatest middle
distance star, in the half-mile as a
Winged-O performer against his for
mer teammates.
Eastman was slated to compete in
the all-University meet on March
10, but an ailing leg muscle pre
vented his entrance. The former
Card captain is recovered now and
he promises once more to be the
"Blazing" Ben that made so much
Stanford track history.
Eastman's appearance will not be
the only feature of the meet, how
ever. In the mile run, Chuck Nim
mo, slender soph star of the Cards,
meets those two fine Olympians,
Clai'ence Hoist and Norm Bright,
both of whom he defeated in the
all-University meet of a month ago.
Fans may remember that little
"Chuck" had a two-yard lead and
was clocked in 4 minutes 22.9 sec
onds in their first encounter. Both
Hoist and Bright have been training
diligently for the past several days
and undoubtedly will give all they
