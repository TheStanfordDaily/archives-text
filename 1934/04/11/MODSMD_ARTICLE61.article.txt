# DEADLINE SET FOR SHORT STORIES IN NATIONAL CONTEST
## 
### 
Tomorrow is the last day for sub
mission of manuscripts to the Eng
lish Club Yearbook if they are to be
considered for the national college
short story contest offered by
"Story * magazine. All stories sub- '
mitted to the club's Yearbook of
Stanford Writing are automatically
entered in the national contest, j
Other stories, poetry, essays, criti
cism, or parody must be entered for j
the editor's consideration by next
Monday, April 16.
No definite selections of the mate- i
rial already submitted have yet been i
made. James Broughton, editor-in- j
chief, urges that more manuscripts
be handed in, since the range of
both subject matter and types of
writing is comparatively slim. All
contributions are eligible for the
two $25 prizes, while all short stories j
submitted by tomorrow are eligible '
for both the Yearbook awards and '
the $125 offered by "Story" maga- j
zine.
Manuscripts should be deposited I

in the box marked "English Club'
! inside the door of Room 207 in the
English Building.
