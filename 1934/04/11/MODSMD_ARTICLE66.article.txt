# TREAT REPORTS FAR EAST NEWS
## 
### Barbara Sweet 
Concluding his speech with an in-
I dictment of foreign correspondents
on the count of inaccuracy, Profes
sor Payson J. Treat of the Depart
ment of History last night exhibited
insight and earnestness in his dis
cussion of "Interpreting News from
j the Far East."
I! Exciting applause from a large and
interested Tuesday evening audi
ence. Treat pointed his lecture by his
| final statement:
"If the United States and Japan
should, God forbid, go to war, much
j of the responsibility will rest upon
mistaken and misunderstood news
paper reports."
Audience Warned
He also warned the audience that
it is up to thp public to read with
j care and discrimination the reports,
i in order to eliminate the inaccura
cies as much as possible.
Much of the error that finds its
way into print is due, he stated, to
the failure of the correspondent to
distinguish between reporting, in
i terpretation, and prediction.
Reporting on the whole is fairly
accurate, considering the inadequate
facilities in the Far East and espe
cially in China, but it is on interpre-
I tation and prediction that the news
| paper falls down.
Japanese Scares
i As an example, Treat pointed to
, the annual war-scare that results I
I from demands for a large army and I
; navy appropriations when the Japa- '
nese budget is made out in the fall.
| For three months newspapers
; shout "War," pointing to the large
! amounts demanded, then neglect to
j emphasize the fact that these sums 1
| are drastically slashed before the
; bill is passed.
| Treat also described the Japanese J
j interference in Manchuria as a
i blessing to the inhabitants, a fact
j that has ben entirely overlooked by
| the American press.
