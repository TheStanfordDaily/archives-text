# Wirt Refutes Red Charges
## Educator Testifies Before House Committee 
### A.P. Editor 
Indiana's contribution to blatant
politics—Dr. W. A. Wirt—yesterday
went before House Committee ap
pointed to investigate his "red plot"
charges, backed down, and proved
what cool observers had long sus
pected: that .the whole story was
an overplayed farce.
His two main contentions, as pre
sented in the manuscript which led
to his being called, were: (1) an in
timation that a brain truster had
likened F. R. to Kerensky (Russia's
pre-Bolsheviki Revolutionary lead
er), and (2) that the "brain trust"
was planning a revolution. These he
nobly refuted in his oral testimony.
Laurence Todd of a Soviet news
agency, turned out to be the man
behincf the Kerensky allusion. The
reporter promptly denied the
charges.
When it came to naming the brain
trusters with the dangerous ideas,
Wirt named five minor, non-key po
sition figures, three of whom were
women. One was a PWA engineer,
one a textile code leader, two of the
women were lesser figures in the
agriculture department.
The fifth, Miss Alice Barrow, was
hostess of a dinner in her Virginia
home, on Sept. 1, 1933. It was here
that Wirt placed the hearing by him
of the red plans. Laughter, and
"ohs" and "ahs" were heard amid his
revelations at this point.
His fellow diners lost no time in
contradicting the Indiana educator
on nearly all points. D. C. Coyle,
the PWA man, spoke decisively,
saying, "All I know is .... he wanted
to argue Nobody discussed
anything that evening, because he
got going on gold and no one else
had a chance to say anything."
In his ramblings, Wirt quoted
much of the Administration advi
sers' ideas at second hand, besides
bringing in the names of Mrs. F.R.,
Speaker Rainey, Rex Tugwell, and
Secretary of Agriculture Rainey.
