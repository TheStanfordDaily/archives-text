# HECKSCHER TO FURNISH MUSIC FOR HADES BALL
## 15 Musicians, 5 Vocalists In Orchestra Combination For Masque Affair BID SALE PROGRESSES Appearance of Sensational Coast Singer Rumored 
### Kathleen Cottrell 
Ernie Heckscher's orchestra, an
imposing aggregation of 15 musi
cians and five vocalists, will be fea
tured at the Masque Ball, Friday,
April 20, announced Chairman Stan
Beaubaire last night.
Something new and different in
the way of campus orchestras is
promised in Heckscher's combina
tion which includes three violins
(one doubling on a viola), two gui
tars, one string bass, three saxo
phones, two pianos, two trumpets,
one trombone, and a drum.
150 Bids Sold
Bid sale went forward yesterday
with 150 sold and the promise of an
early sell-out. The Rally Committee
reiterated the fact that bids are
limited so that the floor will not be
crowded. Roughs are advised to
buy today because only a few of the
ducats are left.
The orchestra will be completely
made up in devils' costumes, and
gives assurance of a "red-hot" eve
ning. Rumors of a sensational Pa
cific Coast vocalist with Heckscher's
band were met with a noncommit
tal smile by the young maestro last
night. "Wait and see," he said.
Balloting Re-opened
The King Contest went ahead
when the Rally Committee decided
last night to re-open it for final
balloting tomorrow noon at eating
groups, and close it then to open big
Monday morning. Every registered
student will be reminded that all
profits go to the Convalescent Home
kiddies.
All units are going to ask mem
bers to vote tomorrow at a penny
a vote with a minimum of ten votes
a person and no limit set. In this
way the entire campus will vote in
the final balloting, the kiddies will
benefit, and a popular royal couple
will be elected.
A public address system, the ex
act duplicate of those in the larger
San Francisco hotels, will be on
hand for the evening.
