# Parties Attack As Wirt Farce Nears Windup
## Mrs. F.R. Fails to See Any Communism in Letting Men Earn Living Wirt Jailed as Pro-German, Bulwinkle Charges 
### 
WASHINGTON, April li (IP).â€”
Inter-party strife occurred anew in
Congress over Dr. William Wirt's
assertions of revolutionary attempts
within Roosevelt's administration.
Earlier in the day, the President's
wife had replied in no indefinite way
to the Gary man's assertions that
the Reedsville, W.Va., homestead
subsistence project was "commu
nistic."
She said to newsmen: "I do not
understand how he considers it com
munistic to give people a chance io
earn their own living and buy their
own homes." He had branded it as
such in upholding his anti-brain
trust charges.
Republican McGugin, investigat
ing committee member, contended
that its procedure so far was a
"misadministration of American jus
tice." Democrat Bulwinkle, commit
tee chairman, replied that the "rules
of common decency" would forbid
anyone to publicly criticize a House
committee before its work was fin
ished.
Shortly thereafter, Bulwinkle add
ed a reference to Wirt's former ac
tivities that stai'ted a round of de
nials. In replying to McGugin's
criticism, he said: "If we had been
prosecuting him, the fact that the
school superintendent had been put
in jail would have been brought
out." Pro-German activities during
the war was the reason for his con
finement, according to the committee
head.
In answering the charge, W. F.
Hodges, war-time mayor of Gary,
spoke in part as follows: "That's a
vicious lie. Rep. Bulwinkle is a
bulwinkling liar. Superintendent
Wirt was 100 per cent American
during the war."
McGugin also pronounced that
Wirt's record was clean. In Gary,
no record of any penalty imposed
upon the educator could be found.
Festivities were climaxed by Bul
winkle's assertion, with one finger
shaking in McGugin's face, that the
Republicans were disappointed be
cause Wirt had furnished them no
political ammunition. He ended by
saying: "It was, it is, and it's going
to be an absolute flop.''
