# Bill Myers Writes Book On Mountain Adventures
## 
### 
Campus friends of Bill Myers, last
year's managing editor of the Daily,
yesterday received copies of a book
he has just written, "Back Trails,"
in which he and his father have re
corded their treks into the mount
tains of their country and of Alaska.
Only 500 copies were printed, each
being given to a friend, and then the
type was destroyed. Bill is at pres
ent editing a paper in Michigan. He
graduated from Stanford in 1933 and
is a member of Theta Delta Chi.
