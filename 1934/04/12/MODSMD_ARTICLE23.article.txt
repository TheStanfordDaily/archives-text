# Lyman Maintains Stand Opposing Sponsor Clause
## 
### Frank Orr 
A note of opposition still remained
last night as the new A.S.S.U. Con
stitution awaited a vote for approval
or rejection. John Lyman, A.S.S.U.
vice-president, who recorded the
only negative vote on the question
of submitting the proposed plan of
government to election, said then
that he was "still definitely opposed
to- the sponsor clause."
He added, however, that he would
not make a definite statement on his
stand until later.
Tlie clause to which Lyman ob
jects is one providing for the ap
pointment of men's sponsors by the
Dean of Men from a selective confi

dential list supplied him by a com
mittee composed of the head sponsor,
the president of the A.S.S.U., and
the chairman of the Men's Council.
The A.S.S.U. "vice-president de
clared last night that his objection
was not to the Constitution as a
whole, but rather to the one clause
he opposed in Tuesday night's Ex
Committee meeting.
Next Tuesday the plan goes to a
student vote when the polls are
opened for official acceptance of re
jection of the articles which provide
a new framework upon which to
build a complete student govern
ment. The Constitution appears on
page four of today's Daily.
