# Biology Head Gives Speach
## Reorganized School to Be Consistent, Unified 
### 
The first announcement of the
complete reorganization of the Bio
logical School was made public last
night by Professor Charles V. Tay
lor, executive head of the School of
Biological Sciences, in the depart
ment major talk in the Little Thea
tre.
Stating that "It is inconceivable to
a biologist that the problems of the
present day could be solved by in
dividuals who do not know the ele
mentary principles of biology," Tay
lor explained how essential were
certain courses in the department to
all students and then went on to
tell of the revolutionary reorgani
zation plans.
Stanford a Leader
Taylor stated: "In reorganizing the
Biological School Stanford is mak
ing a move that constitutes real
leadership. Harvard is the only
other college to have put a similar
plan into effect.
"Individual departments of the
school have been gradually growing
more distinct and isolated but with
this new redistribution of subject
matter, consistency and unity will
be emphasized throughout."
Courses Correlated
Briefly the important phases of
this "New Deal" for the Biological
School,are: abolition of Zoology and
Botany; all degrees to be granted in
Biology only; Biology I and II to
be kept; 24 units of fundamental
Biology and 22 units of physical
science required of majors; corre
lation of all courses so that com
plete specialization will be elimi
nated.
"The fields of medicine, teaching,
agriculture, forestry, fisheries, re
search, and government positions
are the fields that graduates of the
school most commonly enter," Tay
lor said.
"This new organization is a step
toward less requirements, more in
dividual study, and is wholly in
keeping with modern, enlightened
methods of higher education in the
scientific field.
