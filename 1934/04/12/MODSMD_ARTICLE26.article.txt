SAN FRANCISCO. April 11 </P).â€”
San Francisco may get about $337,-
500 in Federal aid to tide her over
in relief and unemployment matters
during April, it was hinted at the
office of the State Administrator, as
word was also received that the new
work to be set up will not be nearly
as large in scope as the discarded
CWA.
The new work program, which
was to have been instituted April 16,
has been held up as a result of no
Federal or State funds to pay com
pensation insurance.
