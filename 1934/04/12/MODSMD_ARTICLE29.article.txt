# Club Argues On Coercion
## Views of Liberal, Pacifist, Communist Stated 
### 
In a three-cornered discussion of
the question, "Is Coercion a Neces
sary Means of Social Change?" the
viewpoints of the liberal, the pacifist,
and the communist were presented
before the regular meeting of the
Walrus Club held last night in the
Women's Clubhouse. Miss Louise
Price, as liberal; Professor Fred
erick Anderson, as pacifist; and
Mathew Evans, as communist, were
the speakers.
The first two speakers, Miss Price
and Professor Anderson, centered
their discussions around a recent
book by Reinhold Niebuhr, "Moral
Man and Immoral Society." This
book presents the major problems
facing modern civilization, and at
tempts to formulate remedies in a
rational maimer. Miss Price con
tended that we must realize the great
number of problems facing us, and
should attempt to remedy them
through legal means. "There is a
possibility that the new civilization
will be built on the ruins of the old,"
she said, "but we must not concede
that revolution is inevitable." A
rational reorganization of our pres
ent day civilization rather than the
use of coercion is necessary if our
civilization is to remain, she main
tained.
Professor Anderson contended that
"we have a tremendous lack of real
ism in present day discussions of
social problems." "The really seri
ous thing is that we have gotten
such a bad case of nerves," he said
Too little emphasis is placed upon
the elemental and primary virtues
—we are too concerned with com
fort. He believes that a return to
farms and homesteads, accomplished
by peaceful means, is the way out of
our present dilemma.
Mathew Evans, citing the present
conditions in the United States,
where many men are starving and
oppressed by those in power, said,
"The question is not whether a hun
gry man should resort to coei'cion,
it is that he will resort to revolution
whether he should or noi When I
am disgorged from this University
and if I am unable to secure a job,
I shall do my best to destroy this
civilization."
