Future Stanford generations wiJl look hack to April 12,
!!).'{l, iis the day that the new Stanford theatre really be
came more than just an idea. Today the Daily dives
whole-heartedly into the Theatre Fund question with the
announced purpose of bringing a new structure to Stan
ford or learning an excellent reason for the contrary.
Today Comptroller Almon E. Roth returns from Mex
ico, and with him comes promised news of an edifice to
supplant the poor old Stanford Assembly Hall, a relic of
the past and butt of many a local joke despite its years
of undaunted service in trying to fulfill a responsibility for
which it was never adequately constructed.
Six weeks ago, the Daily conferred with Mr. Roth on
tlie immediate posibililies of going ahead with plans for
;i new theatre and saw faint realization of its hopes in the
promise of a complete modern set of plans for the struc
ture which have been worked upon by the official Univer
.silv architects for Ihe past month.
By now, they should be complete. Mr. Roth is back,
;in<! the Daily, after resting its concerted campaign for the
long-awaited Stanford cultural center until his return, will
confer with the Comptroller's otTice today to learn if pos
sible what can and will be done with these plans now that
they are completed.
That Stanford needs a new and adequate home for her
dramatics, Concert Series, Tuesday evening lectures, visit
ing speakers, and other worthy attractions, no one can
deny.
Although it is true that Ihe student body and faculty
will benefit in Ihe main by Ihe construction of the theatre,
alumni and friends of Ihe University are united firmly with
these groups in the determination that construction shall
begin soon.
Students, il is true, have taken the initiative to date.
The way has been hard, and opposition has been great at
times. A.S.S.U. officials are truly grateful to the Adminis
tration for its latest move in preparing modern plans upon
which action may soon be taken.
The next move is to provide sufficient funds for the
theatre. If the Administration can't see its way clear to do
this, it would be a fine gesture for the Associated Students
to bear some of thfc burden as it did in the case of Ihe
Pavilion and the l iiion, and see that Stanford progresses
with its contemporaries.
Every registered undergraduate man student, whether
he knows il or not, is still paying one dollar each quarter
to I lie Stanford Inion. This has been going on for many
years, and it's about time that Ihe $7,000 or so that is ac
crued thusly each year were turned over toward building
ji greater Stanford. What could be better than to build a
new theatre with this fund as a nucleus?
We ask, and wait.

Today Comptroller Almon E. Roth returns from Mex
ico, and with him comes promised news of an edifice to
supplant the poor old Stanford Assembly Hall, a relic of
the past and butt of many a local joke despite its years
of undaunted service in trying to fulfill a responsibility for
which it was never adequately constructed.
Six weeks ago, the Daily conferred with Mr. Roth on
tlie immediate posibililies of going ahead with plans for
;i new theatre and saw faint realization of its hopes in the
promise of a complete modern set of plans for the struc
ture which have been worked upon by the official Univer
.silv architects for Ihe past month.
By now, they should be complete. Mr. Roth is back,
;in<! the Daily, after resting its concerted campaign for the
long-awaited Stanford cultural center until his return, will
confer with the Comptroller's otTice today to learn if pos
sible what can and will be done with these plans now that
they are completed.
That Stanford needs a new and adequate home for her
dramatics, Concert Series, Tuesday evening lectures, visit
ing speakers, and other worthy attractions, no one can
deny.
Although it is true that Ihe student body and faculty
will benefit in Ihe main by Ihe construction of the theatre,
alumni and friends of Ihe University are united firmly with
these groups in the determination that construction shall
begin soon.
Students, il is true, have taken the initiative to date.
The way has been hard, and opposition has been great at
times. A.S.S.U. officials are truly grateful to the Adminis
tration for its latest move in preparing modern plans upon
which action may soon be taken.
The next move is to provide sufficient funds for the
theatre. If the Administration can't see its way clear to do
this, it would be a fine gesture for the Associated Students
to bear some of thfc burden as it did in the case of Ihe
Pavilion and the l iiion, and see that Stanford progresses
with its contemporaries.
Every registered undergraduate man student, whether
he knows il or not, is still paying one dollar each quarter
to I lie Stanford Inion. This has been going on for many
years, and it's about time that Ihe $7,000 or so that is ac
crued thusly each year were turned over toward building
ji greater Stanford. What could be better than to build a
new theatre with this fund as a nucleus?
We ask, and wait.
Future Stanford generations wiJl look hack to April 12,
!!).'{l, iis the day that the new Stanford theatre really be
came more than just an idea. Today the Daily dives
whole-heartedly into the Theatre Fund question with the
announced purpose of bringing a new structure to Stan
ford or learning an excellent reason for the contrary.
