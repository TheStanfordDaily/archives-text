# WHY IT'S NEWS
## F.R.'s Vacatson 
### CROMPTON BANGS, JR 
The President is still vacationing
in and around Florida. But his
work follows him around. Even his
right-hand men have to. Today the
Nos. 1 and 2 NRA men, Adminis
trator Johnson and Lawyer Rich
berg, will meet F.R. in Miami. The
conversation will ricTt be about fish
ing.
Underground, but nevertheless se
rious troubles have arisen in the
NRA. Hence today's meeting. The
outcome is expected to have a lot
to do with the Blue Eagle's future
actions and prospects.
NRA Troubles
Just now there are several things
worrying General Johnson. Soft coal
miners and owners are glaiing at
each other across a conference table
in Washington. The trouble here has
always been that the Northern and
Southern mine owners paid differ
ent wages.
The NRA allowed the Southern
mines to keep on paying a dollar a
day less. Naturally, Northern mines
kicked at this competition. Last
week, the General reduced the dif
ference between wages. The South
ern owners went to court, threaten
ing to tie the NRA up in legal red
tape. To make it worse, a belliger
ent independent miners' union is
thinking of striking.
Autos, Unionism
In Detroit, F.R.'s plan has failed
to bring peace between the motor
men and their workers. The tool
and die makers are scheduled to
strike today. Last fall they tied up
the whole industry. They may do
it again.
The American Federation of la
bor is still contending that company
unions are "muscling in" on their
field, organizing workers by the
droves. In the very near future,
F.R. will have to support or ding the
Wagner bill to kill company unions.
A few weeks ago he might have
supported it, but opposition is too
strong now. F.R.'s disapproval may
mean more strikes.
Enforcement, Reorganization
While the President was fishing,
General Johnson announced NRA
code violators would be hauled into
court. He promptly hired a hun
dred-odd bright young lawyers to
do the hauling. If the General
means business and F.R. does, it
means a long legal battle.
The NRA has been reorganized
fwice in the past two weeks. Each
change gave industry and the in
dustry - dominated code authorities
more power. This may be a step
toward letting industry govern it
self, as it will have to when the NRA
expires a year or so from now.
These are the things the President
and his right hand men will talk
about today. All of them show the
results of growing opposition. He
will have to meet it soon. He may
do so today.

work follows him around. Even his
right-hand men have to. Today the
Nos. 1 and 2 NRA men, Adminis
trator Johnson and Lawyer Rich
berg, will meet F.R. in Miami. The
conversation will ricTt be about fish
ing.
Underground, but nevertheless se
rious troubles have arisen in the
NRA. Hence today's meeting. The
outcome is expected to have a lot
to do with the Blue Eagle's future
actions and prospects.
NRA Troubles
Just now there are several things
worrying General Johnson. Soft coal
miners and owners are glaiing at
each other across a conference table
in Washington. The trouble here has
always been that the Northern and
Southern mine owners paid differ
ent wages.
The NRA allowed the Southern
mines to keep on paying a dollar a
day less. Naturally, Northern mines
kicked at this competition. Last
week, the General reduced the dif
ference between wages. The South
ern owners went to court, threaten
ing to tie the NRA up in legal red
tape. To make it worse, a belliger
ent independent miners' union is
thinking of striking.
Autos, Unionism
In Detroit, F.R.'s plan has failed
to bring peace between the motor
men and their workers. The tool
and die makers are scheduled to
strike today. Last fall they tied up
the whole industry. They may do
it again.
The American Federation of la
bor is still contending that company
unions are "muscling in" on their
field, organizing workers by the
droves. In the very near future,
F.R. will have to support or ding the
Wagner bill to kill company unions.
A few weeks ago he might have
supported it, but opposition is too
strong now. F.R.'s disapproval may
mean more strikes.
Enforcement, Reorganization
While the President was fishing,
General Johnson announced NRA
code violators would be hauled into
court. He promptly hired a hun
dred-odd bright young lawyers to
do the hauling. If the General
means business and F.R. does, it
means a long legal battle.
The NRA has been reorganized
fwice in the past two weeks. Each
change gave industry and the in
dustry - dominated code authorities
more power. This may be a step
toward letting industry govern it
self, as it will have to when the NRA
expires a year or so from now.
These are the things the President
and his right hand men will talk
about today. All of them show the
results of growing opposition. He
will have to meet it soon. He may
do so today.
The President is still vacationing
in and around Florida. But his
work follows him around. Even his
right-hand men have to. Today the
Nos. 1 and 2 NRA men, Adminis
trator Johnson and Lawyer Rich
