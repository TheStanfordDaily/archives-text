# BULL SESSION
## BLOCK "S"S AND BLOCK HEADS 
### 
To many people, almost anything
except a cancer is better if it is big
ger. In fact the craze for bigger, if
not better, things has gone so far
that there are vast numbers who
would rather have a major opera
tion for appendicitis than a puny
little tonsillectomy.
* * *
So it is with athletic awards.
There was a time when football
heroes were content with their hard
won letters. Now they demand and
get, in addition, sweaters, jackets,
blankets, and scholarships. Such be
ing the case, to some it appears
downright indecent to refuse to
minor-sportsmen a major-sport let
ter. But simply because major
sportsmen have in many cases been
treated as sacred white elephants, is
no very good reason for making the
Farm a rival of the Fleishhacker
Zoo.
* * *
Why do minor-sportsmen want
Block "S"s instead of Circle "S"s?
Presumably, so that they may be
come just as blatant as those major
worthies who have tickled the
cockles and plucked the heartstrings
of the five and eight hundred. Of
course, it is a little difficult to un
derstand just why a clever fencer
or a skillful diver should wish to
confuse himself with the average
broadbacked denizen who haunts
the college gridiron. But the urge
is unmistakably there.

To most of us, a Block "S" is the
sign of one proficient in football,
basketball, baseball, or track. The
| Circle "S"s have held just as much
j or as little significance, indicating
I merely expertness or doggedness in
another direction. If there are (o be
letters at all, it seems only right
that a sheep should remain a sheep,
and a wolf a wolf—instead of trying
I to revivify an Aesop's fable.
* * *
A large letter can mean no more
to a minor sportsman except in so
far as it will make him masquerade
for something that he. is not, and
give him an imagined prominence
which does not exist. It should not
i be the part of the A.S.S.U. to foster
1 deception or vanity.
* * *
If Stanford golfers or fencers wlil
not golf or fence unless a Block
1 "S" dangles in front of their clubs
! and foils, assuredly they miscon-
I strue the aim of sport.

A large letter can mean no more
to a minor sportsman except in so
far as it will make him masquerade
for something that he. is not, and
give him an imagined prominence
which does not exist. It should not
i be the part of the A.S.S.U. to foster
1 deception or vanity.

If Stanford golfers or fencers wlil
not golf or fence unless a Block

Do amateurs play for sport or for

To many people, almost anything
except a cancer is better if it is big
ger. In fact the craze for bigger, if
not better, things has gone so far
that there are vast numbers who
would rather have a major opera
tion for appendicitis than a puny
little tonsillectomy.
* * *
So it is with athletic awards.
There was a time when football
heroes were content with their hard
won letters. Now they demand and
get, in addition, sweaters, jackets,
blankets, and scholarships. Such be
ing the case, to some it appears
downright indecent to refuse to
minor-sportsmen a major-sport let
ter. But simply because major
sportsmen have in many cases been
treated as sacred white elephants, is
no very good reason for making the
Farm a rival of the Fleishhacker
Zoo.

Why do minor-sportsmen want
Block "S"s instead of Circle "S"s?
Presumably, so that they may be
come just as blatant as those major
worthies who have tickled the
cockles and plucked the heartstrings
of the five and eight hundred. Of
course, it is a little difficult to un
derstand just why a clever fencer
or a skillful diver should wish to
confuse himself with the average
broadbacked denizen who haunts
the college gridiron. But the urge
is unmistakably there.

To most of us, a Block "S" is the
sign of one proficient in football,
basketball, baseball, or track. The
| Circle "S"s have held just as much
j or as little significance, indicating
I merely expertness or doggedness in
another direction. If there are (o be
letters at all, it seems only right
that a sheep should remain a sheep,
and a wolf a wolf—instead of trying
I to revivify an Aesop's fable.
