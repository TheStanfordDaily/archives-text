SAMUEL JOHNSON. By Hugh
Kingsmill. Viking Press, New
York, 1934.
Thorough scholarship, excellent
writing, and clarity of purpose char
acterize this latest biography of
Samuel Johnson. Hugh Kingsmill
an intensely intereresting style
to enable hiry to compress success
fully the events «f Johnson's life
into 250 pages; the work is neither
crowded nor hurried, and yet is
strikingly complete and thorough.
Purporting to present Johnson as
a human being rather than an in
telectual monstrosity, Kingsmill has
taken pains not to over-emphasize
any single phase of his career. Thus
he has given just, if more than
usual, attention to the early years of
the Doctor's life. He has clearly
portrayed Johnson's background and
has given a vivid picture of the
"disorders of body and distaurb
ances of the mind" which so affected
the entire life of the great literary
director.
And the succeeding portions of
the book are in true perspective, and
we have valuable accounts of "Ras
selas," "The Lives of the Poets," and
tha edition of Shakespeare, as well
as the Dictionary and the minor
works.
Special attention is devoted to
Boswell's "Lite of Johnson," the
scenes of which Kingsmill analyzes
as those Boswell provoked inten
tionally, those he provoked unin
tentionally, and those he absorbed as
a disinterested spectator.
Throughout the work Kingsmill
recreates vividly the procession of
famous figures who surrounded
Johnson: Pope, Garrick, Chester
lield, Boswell, Goldsmith, Reynolds,
Fanny Burney, and the Thrales—
and towering over them all, as he
did over his age, is Doctor John
son, shown here by a deft biogra
pher as a human being as well as a
great man of letters. •

LENIN: A BIOGRAPHPY. By Ralph
Fox. Harcourt, Bracc & Co., New
York, 1934. Stanford Bookstore
Lending Library.)
Much has been written to inter
pret the life of Nicolai Lenin, ar
chitect of modern Russia; by one he
is depicted as demi-god, by another
as diabolical.
Fox, an authority on Lenin, and
a student of note on Soviet Russia,
gives a saner view, and although he
is sympathetic with the man whose
life he writes, we have on the whole
a scholarly and well-written biog
raphy.
We find an engrossing account of
Lenin's early home life, his educa
tion and university days. Highly
impressionistic, Lenin turned in
stinctively to the betterment of ex
isting conditions, was arrested and
after a term in prison, exiled in
Siberia.
The scene then shifts to his return
to Russia, and subsequent trips to
London, Paris, and Switzerland, en
gaged all the while in socialistic
activities. Then came the war and
Lenin's return to Russia after the
incipient Revolution, the establish
ment of his own party in power, and

the struggle to maintain his soviet |
creation.
We find here a Lenin, no dreamer,
neither the traditional leader of
"blood and iron." Rather an in- !
tensely practical intellect set in a j
slight bodily frame which is a dy
namo of energy.
Fox excels in a well-balanced por- j
trait of both Lenin's life and phi- j
losophy, but might spend more space
interpreting the international back
ground.
