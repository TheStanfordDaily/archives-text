The Editor, Sir:
There is a real need for a con
structive plan to alter the relations
of the so-called major and minor
sports; one based 011 the realization
that there have always been major
and minor athletes, but never major
and minor sports in actuality—only
on paper, and on the opportunity for
"major" athletes in all sports to win
the coveted block "S."
If a provision were to be inserted
in the by-laws that the winning of
two letters in a first class minor
sport, or three letters in a second
class minor sport would entitle the
athlete to a block "S" award, and
if at the same time the require
ments for letters in ALL sports were
lightened up a little, then the major
athletes in all sports would receive
an equal reward, and have an equal
goal to strive for.
Such a plan would not flood the
country with block "S'' cards, or les
sen the honor of winning a block,
and would rectify a long standing
injustice. It would be an evolving,
not a radical change that should be
| acceptable to all groups at Stanford.
