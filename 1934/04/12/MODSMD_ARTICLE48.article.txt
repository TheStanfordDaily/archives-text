# SWORD, SANDALS READING TONIGHT
## First Presentation of Quarter Features Play of O'Neill, Foremost of American Playwrights 
### JAMES SANDOE 
A.% the first reading of the spring quarter, Sword and Sandals will pre
sent Eugene O'Neill's "S.S. Glencairn" group in the Little Theatre this
evening. Curtain is set for 7:30 o'clock, and a 10-cent admission will be |
charged in order to cover the royalty charge for these four short plays of
the sea by America's foremost playwright.

rho casts are as follows:
Driscoll William Gwinn
Yank Paul Clary
Cocky Waldo Sail
Olsori Carter Meyer
Smitty George Leavens
Ivan Dick Dawson
Paddy Robert Cathcart
Scotty Joseph La wry
Jack William Knapp
Old Tom Thomas Seller
Davis Henry Brill
First Mate William Knapp
Captain. Robert Dwan
Bella Virginia Marvin
Pearl Mary Liles
Kate Jeannette Rosenfeld
Freda Henrietta Jones
Fat Joe Robert Cathcart
Nick Robert Dwan
Paul Crary, William Gwinn, Car
ter Meyer, and George Leavens have
been placed in the heaviest roles,
although as O'Neill has written the
plays, the total effect is that of an
ensemble rather than of four plays
with four stellar figures.
Although individually these dra
matic sketches have been seen on
programs of one-act plays, this is,
so far as can be ascertained, one of
Ihe very few presentations of the
"S.S. Glencairn" group as a whole.
The variety of the readings which
have been sponsored by Sword and !
Sandals during the past two years,
and which have included such di
verse plays as "The Duchess of,
Malfi" and "Let 'Em Eat Cake,"
makes it impossible for the presen- i
tation of these O'Neill plays to be a |
surprising fact.
The plays, while they are not re
lated by a continuity of plot, have a ;
unity of asmosphere and character j
which make them an unmistakable i
whole.
Robert Brauns has directed the j
readers in this difficult task and, ac- !
cording to report, will have an un- I
usually fine performance ready for
tonight's audience.
