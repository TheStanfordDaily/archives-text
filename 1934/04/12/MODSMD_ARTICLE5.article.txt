## Stanford Professors Query Anti-Picketing Ruling 
### 
Recognizing possible serious im
plications behind the recent "anti
picketing" ordinance passed recently
in Santa Clara County, members of
the Stanford Department of Eco
nomics this week sent a formal pro
test to the Board of Supervisors.
The ordinance, signed to prevent
farm strikes, in general provides
against loitering or standing on the
public highways, prohibits parades
on public highways without per
mits, makes it unlawful to hold any
meeting or to deliver speeches, lec
tures, or debates without permission.
The protest cites three reasons for
urging repeal of the ordinance.
Violates Constitution
In the first place, the signers be
lieve the rights of free speech and
free assembly guaranteed in ai'ticle
1, sections 9 and 10 of the California
Constitution would be violated if the
ordinance were utilized. Instead of
minimizing, force would be encour
aged, since the ordinance may serve
to prevent peaceful picketing and
assemblage of workers.
Secondly, it invites workers to at
tempt to gain their ends by violent
means. Openly stating that county
authorities are hostile to the objec
tives of labor, the ordinance only
serves to provide radical labor agi
tators with apparent proof of the
uselessness of negotiation.
Against N.R.A.
Lastly, the ordinance is contrary
to the spirit of the N.R.A., in that it
reflects opposition to the principle of
collective bargaining.

fessors John B. Canning, Donald M.

E. Keller, Richard T. LaPiere, Theo
