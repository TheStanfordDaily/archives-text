## Helvenston Predicts Clever Character Portrayal 
### Annalee Whitmore 
A hectic household and its idiotic
! activities form the plot of "Three
Cornered Moon," hilarious comedy
set for production by Director Hel
venston and his dramatic groups
some time in May.
"The cast," he predicts, "is bril
liant." Experience and aptitude form
a combination which, he considers,
will result in one of the most per
fectly executed of Stanford opuses.
Jean Albertson, if early rehearsals
are a reliable criterion, will "bring
down the house" in her role of Mrs.
Rimplegar, the most joyous lunatic
of the entire assemblage. Miss Al
bertson will be called upon to fill a
matronly role, with unusual comic
character possibilities.
From covered wagon to kitchen
goes Kay Arthur, feminine lead of
"Distant Drums" and portrayer of
the Swedish maid Jenny in the cur
rent drama. Her accent, combined
with her unique misunderstanding
of the enterprising Rimplegars, pro
vides a difficult but opportune as
signment.
Shelley Smith graduates from a
minor role in her last play to the
ingenue, Elizabeth, at once the pride
and despair of her family. Harriet
Hall gained the one-act part of Kitty,
the most flapperish of flappers.
The masculine contingent, says
Helvenston, is no less capable. Rob
ert Balzar, known to campus theatre
goers by his performances in "Hawk
Island" and "Enemy of the People,"
fills a difficult and important part.
James Benet receives the part of his
career, with perhaps the most ex
acting interpretation required.
Joe Chamberlain progresses up
the dramatic scale with a large role,
and Pete Peck, experienced and
popular, completes the unique cast. I
