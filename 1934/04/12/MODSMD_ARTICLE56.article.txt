the period of refund will continue
till May 1. Repayments of 40, 60,
and 80 cents will be made to students
holding season tickets, and the gen

Prentice Messimer, student man
ager of the Concert Series, renewed
his request today, that students hoid
their tickets until fall, when they
will be valid as partial payment on
the next Concert Series. If dissatis
fied at that time, they will be able
to get their money back then, he
announced.
Plans for the 1934-35 series are
progressing rapidly, and many prom
inent artists are being considered.
