# Former Stars to Challenge Trackmen Saturday
## HERBERT, LABORDE EASTMAN, I.C.-4A STARS TO COMPETE Stiff Competition Expected From Winged-O Men 
### Jack Drown 
Stanford stars versus former Stan
ford greats.
Such will be Ihe situation Satur
day afternoon on Angell Field when
Coach Dink Templeton's, Card
spiked-shoe proteges face Coach
Charley Hunter's Winged-O per
formers, exactly one week prior to
the Stanford-California Big Meet.
Saturday's affair takes on the air
of a "Back to the Farm Movement"
on the part of several former Indian
track and field stars.
Ten competitors who once wore
the red and white of Stanford will
participate for the Olympic Club.
Eastman Will Run
Leading the parade of former
Stanford greats will be Ben East
man, finest middle-distance runner
in Card track history, who will com
pete in the half-mile and perhaps
run a lap in the mile relay.
Of no less importance in his own
specialty, comes Here Laßorde, last
year 1.C.4-A. discus champion and
.second-place winner in the 1932
Olympic Games, who will compete
in the discus and shot-put against
the best that the present Stanford
team can offer.
Pressing Laßorde for honors in
the disc event will be Bobby Jones,
an 1.C.4-A winner of two years back,
who will act as captain of the Olym
pic Club squad Saturday.
Hurdle Champ Coming
Another former 1.C.4-A champion
who will be competing for the Olym-.
pic Club is At "Cotto" Herbert, who
won the 220-yard low hurdle title
for Stanford last year and who will
attempt to afford competition in both
flights for Captain Gus Meier and
Sam Klopstock of the present Card
team.
In the dashes Les Hables, Stan
ford's student manager, will attempt
to even his .score with Carl Thorns,
Stanford's sprint ace, who holds de
cisio; over Hables in both dashes
by virtue of his victories in the all —
University meet in March.
The quarter-mile will find three
former Stanford stars, Sam East
man, Don Blackman, and Art Rice,
now competing for the Olympic
Club, attempting to defeat A1 Black
man, brilliant Cardinal ace wh») ran
a 47.8-sccond 440 last Saturday in
the S.F.U. meet.
Moltram Challenge
In the javelin Ernie Arbuckle, a
performer on the 1933 team, will
compete against his former team
mate, John Mottram, and he along
with Ed Waierbury, one-time Cali
fornia ace, should afford Johnny
plenty of competition.
The mile run once more revives
the Nimmo - Bright - Hoist duel.
Bright, who has never been eligible
to run for Stanford due to a trans
fer ruling, is in great shape now as
is Hoist and the duo may extend
Sophomore Chuck to his utmost, al
though he managed to defeat them
by two yards in the March 10 all-
University contest.
Except for Hoist and Waterbury,
the previously mentioned Olympic
Club performers all hail from Stan
ford or are attending the institution
at the present time and have com
pleted their collegiate competition.
They comprise a very powerful
track aggregation in themselves and
flanked by such stars as Hoist, Wa
terbury; Pool and Koblick, .stellar
pole vaulters; Coggeshall and Steers,
"better than average weight" man,
the Olympic Club team will provide
Stanford with a very interesting
afternoon.
