# SOPHS TO SWIM SPRINT EVENTS
## Indian Team Powerful In Breast, Back Stroke 
### 
: Several changes in the personnel
| of the Stanford sprinting entries in
the Third Annual Stanford Univer
sity Swimming Relays tomorrow
night featured time trials this week.
The meet, the first night meet ever
held in the Encina pools, will begin
at 8 o'clock. Students will be ad
mitted free, and women are invited
I to the event.
Sophs Get Places
In trial swims this week, two rap
idly developing sophomores cinched
places in the free-style relays.
Don Petit will swim in both the
400- and 200-yard events. He com
pleted a 24.2 seconds 50-yard spurt;
this is the present Pacific Coast rec
ord for the distance, although Petit
was given the advantage of a relay
start. Petit also looked good in
completing 100 yards in 50.8.
Kuhn Shows Speed
John Kuhn, who at the outset of
the season was nothing more than a
novice splasher, swam 100 yards in
55.4 seconds this week to clinch
another post on the 400-yard team
event. Stanford's team in this event
will include Kuhn, Petit, Gordy
Graves, and John Gardner.
Petit will team with Graves, Gard
ner and Captain Bob Clark in the
200-yard event.
Breast Strokers Good
The most powerful Cardinal event,
the 400-yard breast stroke relay,
will find Bob Foster, Clark, Ken
Livingston, and Fuller competing.
Holly Fitting, Jack Bergman, Clark,
and Myers will swim in the 400-
yard back stroke.
Captain Clark will be called on
for further duty in the 300-yard
medley relay, where he will combine
with Foster and Gardner. Foster
made his best practice time of the
year this week in 100 yards of breast
stroking, swimming the distance in
1 minute 11.6 seconds.
The frosh entry list is unchanged
as a result of competition this week.
Alex McKenzie, Bob Hoover, Don
Peterson, and Ben Voss will swim
the 400-yard free style relay, and
probably Rex Hardy, Bob Haslacher,
and McKenzie will enter the medley
relay. However, Henry Sinton has
shown steady improvement lately,
and he may get the call over Hardy
in the back stroke portion of this
event.
