WE THROW OUR
HAT IN THE RING
In the past few days the editorial
columns of the Daily have been
advocating a change in the type of
athletic award given at Stanford,
favoring the same award for both
major and minor sports. In other
words, they wish to eliminate the
distinction between the two.
At the risk of making the Daily
appear inconsistent and also of our
being accused of prejudice on per
sonal grounds, we are going to de
fend the opposite view. In the mat
ter of inconsistency of the Daily, this
column does not represent the pol
icy of the paper, but merely the
opinion of one writer.
DO MINOR SPORTS
REQUIRE AS MUCH TIME
The biggest point in favor of
abolishing the present distinction
between major and minor sports
seems to be the contention that they
both require the same amount of
time on the part of the ahtlete to
acquire proficiency. Such is not the
however.
Participants in at least four out of
the five major sports in the Univer
sity at present spend from two to
three hours in practice five days a
week and a sixth day in competing
against another team throughout the
period over which their schedule
extends, which is from ten weeks
to three months.
Contrast this with some of the
minor sports. Last Friday the Cali
fornia and Stanford gymnastic teams
met. A certain Stanford man who
took a first place, thus winning a
Circle "S". or under the proposed
system, a Block "S", had been out
for the sport one week.
We are ready to admit that in
order to do this, the athlete prob
ably had to devote as much time
to perfecting himself in his younger
days as the man who wins the pole
vault against California. But that
time, for the most part, v/as part of

childhood recreation while the time
spent by an athlete during his col
lege days is done so at the expense
of studies and money. Obviously
the man who spends one week pre
paring himself for a schedule which
consists of one meet should not re
ceive the same award as the man
who practices daily for three months
and two or three times weekly an
other six months to put himself in
condition for two or three months'
schedule.
SHALL WE HAVE
REORGANIZATION
There are certain minor sports
which do require the same amount
of practice, approximately, as major
sports. A reorganization might be
feasible which would promote such
sports, which include swimming and
soccer, to the major class. Also, if
it can be shown that they do require
as diligent practice as others of
their category, certain major sports
might beVeduced to the lower rank.
If such a change it to be made,
however, thorough investigation of
the sports to be raised or lowered
should be made. Such things as at
tendance, number of players in
volved, whether a full schedule
would be feasible, and expense
should be probed. In doing so, it
should also be remembered that in
terests vary in different places and
change in, comparatively speaking,
short times.

for the sport one week.
We are ready to admit that in
order to do this, the athlete prob
ably had to devote as much time
to perfecting himself in his younger
days as the man who wins the pole
vault against California. But that
time, for the most part, v/as part of

childhood recreation while the time
spent by an athlete during his col
lege days is done so at the expense
of studies and money. Obviously
the man who spends one week pre
paring himself for a schedule which
consists of one meet should not re
ceive the same award as the man
who practices daily for three months
and two or three times weekly an
other six months to put himself in
condition for two or three months'
schedule.
SHALL WE HAVE
REORGANIZATION
There are certain minor sports
which do require the same amount
of practice, approximately, as major
sports. A reorganization might be
feasible which would promote such
sports, which include swimming and
soccer, to the major class. Also, if
it can be shown that they do require
as diligent practice as others of
their category, certain major sports
might beVeduced to the lower rank.
If such a change it to be made,
however, thorough investigation of
the sports to be raised or lowered
should be made. Such things as at
tendance, number of players in
volved, whether a full schedule
would be feasible, and expense
should be probed. In doing so, it
should also be remembered that in
terests vary in different places and
change in, comparatively speaking,
short times.

WE THROW OUR
HAT IN THE RING
In the past few days the editorial
columns of the Daily have been
advocating a change in the type of
athletic award given at Stanford,
favoring the same award for both
major and minor sports. In other
words, they wish to eliminate the
distinction between the two.
At the risk of making the Daily
appear inconsistent and also of our
being accused of prejudice on per
sonal grounds, we are going to de
fend the opposite view. In the mat
ter of inconsistency of the Daily, this
column does not represent the pol
icy of the paper, but merely the
opinion of one writer.
DO MINOR SPORTS
REQUIRE AS MUCH TIME
The biggest point in favor of
abolishing the present distinction
between major and minor sports
seems to be the contention that they
both require the same amount of
time on the part of the ahtlete to
acquire proficiency. Such is not the
however.
Participants in at least four out of
the five major sports in the Univer
sity at present spend from two to
three hours in practice five days a
week and a sixth day in competing
against another team throughout the
period over which their schedule
extends, which is from ten weeks
to three months.
Contrast this with some of the
minor sports. Last Friday the Cali
fornia and Stanford gymnastic teams
met. A certain Stanford man who
took a first place, thus winning a
Circle "S". or under the proposed
system, a Block "S", had been out
for the sport one week.
We are ready to admit that in
order to do this, the athlete prob
ably had to devote as much time
to perfecting himself in his younger
days as the man who wins the pole
vault against California. But that
