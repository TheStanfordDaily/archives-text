# CITY TRACKMEN TO MEET FROSH
## 
### 
In final display of speed and skill
before the all-important Little Big
Meet with the Cal Frosh, Eill El
lington will send his men up against
a formidable opponent in a com
bined team of the San Francisco 'i
High School All-Stars Saturday j
morning at Angell Field.
The city preps made a respectable I
showing against the Cal'Frosh, es- j
pecially in garnering seconds and
thirds, though not able to win many
events. One event, the pole vault, is i
a certain, five points for the preps, j
with George Varoff, national inter- |
scholastic champion from Balboa, j
able to clear 13 feet any day he is j
pressed. '
Another strong event for the city !
lads is the shot, in which George [
Lippman of Lowell can hoist the 12- j
pound ball 53 feet, while McGuire j
of Poly in the sprints and Luisetti i
of Galileo in the high jump are j
sure point winners.
Meanwhile the frosh are coming j
along at a slow dog-trot, not much
improvement having been shown in i
anything. A big blow is the injury I
to the elbow of Ray Williamson, who j
at the start of tho season looked
like he would approach 200 feet in
the javelin. He has not been able ;
to extend himself latoly, experienc
ing the same trouble at present suf- j
fered by Bill Beatty of the varsity. '
Jack Carlson, small but with good '
form, may edge in for a place for j
the Stanford frosh.
