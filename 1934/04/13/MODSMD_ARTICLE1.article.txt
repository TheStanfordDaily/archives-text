# STAGE SET FOR THIRDSTANFORD RELAYS TONIGHT
## Outstanding Swimmers Of California to Gather In Encina Pools CARDS DEFEND TITLE Entries Include 23 Teams, 230 Individual Stars 
### Millard Browne 
Stanford is prepared for her Third
Annual Stanford University Swim
ming Relays tonight.
The Cardinal team is set to make
a bid for the title. Floodlights have
been installed. Railings and plat
forms have even been painted.
And Coach Nort Thornton, who is
handling the affair, announces the
scene is laid to give a mixed audi
ence the most colorful swimming
meet on the Pacific Coast this year,
and the biggest aquatic event ever to
be staged in Encina pools.
The meet will start at 8 o'clock,
and the final event will be com
pleted shortly after 9:30 o'clock.
Students will be admitted free, and
the general public will be charged
40 cents.
Entry List Swelled
Entries have been boosted to 230
individuals representing 23 teams.
The latest additions are Galileo and
Lodi High Schools.
Three classes of competition are
aimed to make the meet close
throughout. Colleges and club teams
will contend for honors in Class A,
junior colleges and freshmen will
swim in Class B. and high schools
will enter Class C.
Trial heats in a few of the over
crowded high school events will be
run this afternoon. Because of the
division into classes, trials will not
be necessary in other events.
Cards Defend Title
Cardinal swimmers are defending
a two-year title. In 1932, Stanford
won every Class A event. Last year
the Indians nosed out a brilliant
young Y.M.C.A. team for first place.
Partly because the Y squad will be
represented only by reserves, Coach
Nort Thornton's men are slight fa
vorites to repeat, with the Olympic
Club and Lakeside both acknowl
edged good chances of toppling the
champions.
Long Beach Junior College and
San Jose State are joint defenders
of the 1933 Class B title, while Long
Beach and Tamalpais tied for first
in the high school division last year.
Long Beach is rated ahead of any
other prep entry this year.
Entries Announced
Team entries to date in the college
class include Stanford, Olympic
Club, Lakeside, Athens Athletic
Club, California, and Y.M.C.A. re
serves.
Representatives of the following
Class B teams will compete: Stan
ford and California freshmen, Menlo,
Santa Maria, and Long Beach Junior
Colleges, and San Jose State Junior
College division.
Besides the two defending cham
pions, Santa Maria, Berkeley, Palo
Alto, Galileo, Sequoia, Stockton, and
Lodi High Schools will swim in the
third class. Nearly all of these prep '
teams claim championships in their
various sections of the state, and the
winner tonight will unofficially be
crowned state title holder.
Stars to Compete
Individual record holders galore
