# Women Study Elimination of Greek Houses
## Committee Investigates Different Angles Of Row Controversy "800" to Vote on Question In Secret Ballot 
### Edwine Montague 
An A.W.S. Commission, composed
of representatives of organizations,
classes, and living groups, has been
making an attempt to study the ef
fects of sororities on the campus,
and will have a secret ballot taken
on the question among Stanford
women in the near future.
Because the number of Stanford
women is being doubled in two
years, many campus institutions are
being reviewed in the light of the
new situation. In the case of the
sorority system, opinion has been
impeded by various social forces.
All A.W.S. to Vote
Howevei', since the existence of
sororities concerns all of A.W.S., and
since A.W.S. is partly responsible
for the sort of social institutions that
are bequeathed to future freshmen,
it is only fair that the members of
A.W.S. be allowed to express their
individual opinions with those so
cial forces removed.
For more than two months the
commission has been meeting for
discussion of the sorority situation
from the tingles of women repre
senting all the different groups on
the campus. Through sub-connnit
tees the commission has been work
ing on a report which will be pub
lished in the Daily next week.
Study Health Effect
Special sub-committees have been
studying various aspects of the ex
isting system. One investigated the
health and scholarship records of
row and hall women. Another
looked into the legal angle of setting
up living-group arrangements —
whether the sorority houses could
be used successfully as halls, the
way Mariposa has served this year.
Other problems, such as the finan
cial requisites of row and hall and
the effects of rushing periods on the
Freshmen, were also considered.
The commission has tried to look
at the matter from every possible
poi tnof view, studying both the
advantages and disadvantages. The
results of their work will be pre
sented in their report.
