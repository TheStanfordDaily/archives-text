Featuring special arrangements
and novel numbers, Ernie Heck
scher's 15-piece orchestra will play
in "Hell," March 20. An unusual at
traction will be a wandering trio of
two violins and a guitar.
Persistent rumor has it that a
prominent San Francisco vocalist
will come down to the Farm that
night to add to the festivity of the
occasion.
