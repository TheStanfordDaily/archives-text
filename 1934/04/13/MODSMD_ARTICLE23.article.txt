## 
### CHARLOTTE BURRIDGE 
"Universities cannot create seli
thinking students unless they them
selves are left open—are liberal,"
said Dr. Glenn Frank, president of
the University of Wisconsin and for
mer editor of the Century Magazine,
as he discussed student problems
following his speech in the Assembly
Hall yesterday afternoon.
"As Jar as I know, Stanford is or- j
ganized in that flexible way, but I
don't know the details of your set
up," Frank admitted. He com- (
mended the campus open forums as
practical training for individual
thinking.
Young for Position
The university president, still no
ticeably young for his position,
which he has held since 1925, pre- j
sents all the dignity and formality
of his more elderly colleagues.
Wearing spats, a white flower in his
coat lapel, and displaying the crisp
white corner of a handkerchief in
his pocket, he revealed no signs of
his having been rushed from one
audience to another, or that ho was
suffering from a head cold.
"I think a four-year college
i

course snouia nc integrated arouna
a planned attempt to understand
economic and political policies and
world relations," the smooth-faced
speaker continued.
Colleges should discipline the kind
of thinking in such a way that stu
dents will reason for themselves,
and at least, not gain their political
stand from inheritance. They should
be trained against thinking in
stereotypes."
Propaganda Resistance
In the current complex govern
mental system, which he describes
as a collection of plans with cross
currents of ideas, Dr. Frank con
siders it of vital importance to
build up a resistance in the student
against political propaganda.
"It is the business of education to
resist political pressures with which
men and women come in contact in
latter life," he believes.
Stating that the present federal
administration is a mixture of "frag
ments of fascism" and "traces of
socialism.' the educator admitted
that there is no way of knowing just
how lo classify it.
