# Lyman Cancels Opposition to New Document
## Retains Objection to Clause Regarding Appointment Of Sponsor Group Constitution Presented In Corrected Version 
### Frank Orr 
John Lyman, A.S.S.U. vice-presi- j
dent, yesterday removed his opposi- '
tion to the passage of the new j
student body constitution as a whole; j
but he insisted that he still was |
definitely against the men's sponsor |
selection clause and that he would
fight it in the May elections.
If the constitution passes, he said,
he will circulate a petition for
amendment of the disputed point.
Under the new laws 300 signatures 1
on a petition will submit an amend
ment to student voters.
"We do not wish to oppose the
whole constitution on the basis of
an objection to one section," Lyman
said last night, "but we still defi- j
nitely object to the recommendation j
of sponsors by a student committee.
It affords too much opportunity for 1
politics to enter into the system."
The student committee provided ;
for in the proposed set of laws con- j
sists of the A.S.S.U. president, chair
man of the Men's Council, and head
sponsor. This group would prepare 1
a selective confidential list of men !
qualified to be sponsors and submit j
it to the Dean of Men, who would
make the final selection.

Tuesday the proposed constitu
tion, printed in full on page three of
today's Daily, goes to a student vote.
: Clauses significantly different from
the old form of government are:
1. Abolition of separate govern
j ments for women and men and
placing of all authority under the
' Ex Committee.
2. Substitution of a Women's Exec-
I utive, elected by women, in the Ex
Committee for the vice-president,
j except that she is ineligible to suc-
I ceed to the presidency or to officiate
i in the absence of the president.
o. The graduate member of the Ex
Committee acts as vice-president in
substituting for the president.
Councils Appointed
4. The Men's and Women's Coun
i cils are appointed by the Ex Corn
! mittee instead of elected at large,
i 5. Men's sponsors are selected by
I the Dean of Men from a selective,
confidential list prepared by a stu
dent. committee of three.
6. There is but one regular elec-
I tion during the year, in May, and all
I Ex Committee members are chosen
then.
7. Failure to maintain a C average
automatically vacates any elective
J or appointive office under the A.S.
i S.U. This eligibility is determined
' by the current Bawlout.
8. Three hundred instead of 150
signatures on a petition are required
to call an election for constitutional
amendment.
Specify Seniors
9. There is no provision for elec
tive class officers in any but the
J senior class, in which there arc
specified a president, vice-president,
and secretary-treasurer. This means
that the Ex Committee can, when it
sees lit, appoint committees to work
on other class projects.
In general, the Ex Committee
would have much wider discretion
i ary powers. The proposed consti
tution is approximately two-thirds
the length of the present one, which
means that a more skeletonized form
of government is presented.
