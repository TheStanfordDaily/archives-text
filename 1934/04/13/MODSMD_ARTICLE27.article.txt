## Brauns Shows Capabilities As Director 
### John Benton 
Robert Brauns, directing a cast
which assailed a dozen dialects fear
lessly and, in most cases, with con
siderable success, proved his capa
bilities to the audience which heard
the Sword and Sandals reading of
Eugene O'Neill's "S. S. Glencairn" in
the Little Theatre last evening.
William Gwinn was outstanding in
the heaviest role, employing an au
thentic brogue in each of the moods
demanded by the plays of the group.
Carter Meyer, whose dialect was
equally satisfactory, and Paul Crary,
sans dialect, read two difficult roles
well. Meyer was able to avoid the
dangers of the sentimentality in
herent in the nostalgic Olson; his
slow sincerity fitted O'Neill's intent
perfectly.
Of the four women, Henrietta
Jones—with the longest part—and
Mary Liles in a bit, were good.
Jeanette Rosenfeld continues to
promise well and deserves a more
substantial role. Virginia Marvin,
tempered her tendency to stridency
in the mellower negro dialect.
To list the rest cf the long cast
and give each his due praise or
damnation — and there would be
little of the latter—is more than
space or time permits. George Lea
vens, Waldo Salt, and Robert Dwan
were substantially good, and Dick
Dawson, an excellent comedian,
found particular favor with the
audience with his petulant repeti
tions.
