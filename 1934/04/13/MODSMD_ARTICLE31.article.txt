# POSSIBILITIES GOOD FOR CAMPUS THEATRE CONSTRUCTION
## ROTH CONSIDERS NEW PLAN FOR STUDENT MONEY Daily-Suggested Proposal Makes Memorial Group Feasible, Says Comptroller After Previous Statement; Board to Decide 
### ANNALEE WHITMORE 
Campus theatre plans may materialize in the immediate future, accord
ing to word received late last night from Comptroller Almon E. Roth,
allaying fears arising from a previous announcement that no construction
would be contemplated for the present.
F reliminary decision may be reached early next week in accordance
with a Daily-advanced suggestion, with a strong possibility that the matter
will reach a student vote this quarter.

• The new plan provides that A.S.
S.U. back the project financially.
Previous years have seen student
funds make possible the Pavilion and
Union group, for the latter of which
Stanford men are still assessed.
"Plans Feasible"'
"As far as I know," agreed Roth,
"the plans are entirely feasible."
The comptroller will meet early next
week wilh President Ray Lyman
Wilbur and interested student heads
to confer regarding the advisability
of the unexpected suggestion.
Final decision, says Roth, will of
course rest with the Stanford Board
of Trustees. Although their stand
regarding the current plan is un
known, they approved similar sug
gestions in the past, and are rumored
to favor the erection of a campus
theatre.
At next week's meeting, an at
tempt will be made to reach a defi
nite decision as to the type of build
ing desired. Plans will probably in
clude a memorial tower backed by a
court, and flanked on either side by
balanced structures, the edifice on
the right to be the theatre unit under
retention of present plans.
Want :>.OOO Capacity
If a smaller auditorium is decided
upon, cost will be proportionately
lowered. Student sentiment, how
ever, indicates the desirability of an
assembly hall seating two or three
thousand persons, probably includ
ing a little theatre in the basement,
and adjacent classrooms.
Plans have been delayed until the
arrival of President Wilbur from the
East. Specifications will be drawn
up immediately following the deci
sion of the group, if such decision is
favorable.
Expansion of cultural courses has
made even more urgent the con
struction of a new edifice, present
facilities having proven inadequate.
Music, Drama Helped
Additional music courses are found
on this quarter's curriculum, with
correspondingly increased enroll
ment. Director Harold Helvenston
also stresses the fact that improved
dramatic equipment would attract
more students interested in that de
partment, besides furnishing added
opportunities to those already en
rolled.
Roth refused to speak for the
Trustee group. He reminded again,
however, that building of the Pavi
lion and Union under student ini
tiative has been highly satisfactory.
The question will probably come
to a vote in the spring elections, ac
cording to plans advanced by Daily
representatives. In that case, the
financial plan would commence next
fall, making possible beginning of
actual construction within a year.

up immediately following the deci
sion of the group, if such decision is
favorable.
Expansion of cultural courses has
made even more urgent the con
struction of a new edifice, present
facilities having proven inadequate.
Music, Drama Helped
Additional music courses are found
on this quarter's curriculum, with
correspondingly increased enroll
ment. Director Harold Helvenston
also stresses the fact that improved
dramatic equipment would attract
more students interested in that de
partment, besides furnishing added
opportunities to those already en
rolled.
Roth refused to speak for the
Trustee group. He reminded again,
however, that building of the Pavi
lion and Union under student ini
tiative has been highly satisfactory.
The question will probably come
to a vote in the spring elections, ac
cording to plans advanced by Daily
representatives. In that case, the
financial plan would commence next
fall, making possible beginning of
actual construction within a year.
Campus theatre plans may materialize in the immediate future, accord
ing to word received late last night from Comptroller Almon E. Roth,
allaying fears arising from a previous announcement that no construction
would be contemplated for the present.
F reliminary decision may be reached early next week in accordance
with a Daily-advanced suggestion, with a strong possibility that the matter
will reach a student vote this quarter.

• The new plan provides that A.S.
S.U. back the project financially.
Previous years have seen student
funds make possible the Pavilion and
Union group, for the latter of which
Stanford men are still assessed.
"Plans Feasible"'
"As far as I know," agreed Roth,
"the plans are entirely feasible."
The comptroller will meet early next
week wilh President Ray Lyman
Wilbur and interested student heads
to confer regarding the advisability
of the unexpected suggestion.
Final decision, says Roth, will of
course rest with the Stanford Board
of Trustees. Although their stand
regarding the current plan is un
known, they approved similar sug
gestions in the past, and are rumored
to favor the erection of a campus
theatre.
At next week's meeting, an at
tempt will be made to reach a defi
nite decision as to the type of build
ing desired. Plans will probably in
clude a memorial tower backed by a
court, and flanked on either side by
balanced structures, the edifice on
the right to be the theatre unit under
retention of present plans.
Want :>.OOO Capacity
If a smaller auditorium is decided
upon, cost will be proportionately
lowered. Student sentiment, how
ever, indicates the desirability of an
assembly hall seating two or three
thousand persons, probably includ
ing a little theatre in the basement,
and adjacent classrooms.
Plans have been delayed until the
arrival of President Wilbur from the
East. Specifications will be drawn
up immediately following the deci
sion of the group, if such decision is
favorable.
