# Exit the Rough—Enter the Woman

### 
The 200-<)(l(l women who comprise Union (lluh are very
hospitable to Stanford Houghs. This thev have shown and
continue lo show with Sunday afternoon leas and Saturday
night Open House in the Women's Clubhouse. Hut they
lack suitable quarters to be truly and completely hos
pitable. t
Probably the most important thing, women in the
Union have no lobby, and they need one badly. All they
have that even approaches one, is the small reception hall
in front of their dining room the place that used to be the
eni'tance to the I'nion Cafeteria. It seats comfortably a
total of about six people.
Hut right past this little reception hall is the little-used
I'nion Lobby.
No adequate reason exists to prevent this lobby from
being turned over to the women of the Union.
It would provide them with a decent and suitable re
ception room, a place where men waiting for l T nion dates
could sit down inconspicuously and be at ease. It would
give them a place to hold meetings and a room where
newspapers and magazines would be available.
Several objections have been raised to converting the
I'nion Lobby, now open to the public, into a lobby for
women of I'nion Dormitory.
First, the "Union Dollar," collected from the men, helps
to maintain the lobby, supposedly for their convenience.
However, very few men use the lobby, the ones who use it
chiefly being the hashers waiting to go lo work in the
Union Dining Room. Otherwise it is practically deserted.
The lobby is one entrance to the dining room, a sort of
a gathering place for clubs before dinners held in the din
ing room. There is no reason why it couldn't continue to
be so used if (he lobby were opened to the women; more
than that, there is another entrance through the arcades to
the dining room, outside of the lobby, and just as direct.
The Union Dining Room would certainly lose no more
money than it is losing now.
Mariposa, Elm, and Madrono—cottages whose residents
eat at the Union and arc members of Union Club, all have
more adequate reception rooms than the Union now has.
Their combined numbers do not equal the 70-odd girls who
live in the Union itself.
Now, there is no place where all of Union Club may
meet at one time. The women of tin; Union hold meetings
occasionally on the stairs. That is the only place they have
lo get all of them together at once. This is a manifestly
impractical and annoying situation which could be reme
died bv giving them the Union Lobby.
True, part of the men's "Dollar" pays for the lobby, but
most of the roughs don't use it, and roughs are said to have
generous hearts. Hut generosity aside, mere reciprocation
dictates the course. The women contributed to funds which
built the Pavilion, and there was no complaint.
The Union Hoard of Governors controls the Union
Lobby. There should be no complaint when this body turns
it over lo the women of Union Dormitorv.
