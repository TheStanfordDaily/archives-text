# Stanford Marches On!

ll' co-operation jmd unity of purpose by nil groups con
cerned mean anything at all, Stanford will soon have a
theatre truly worthy of the Founders' name.
Yesterday, Comptroller Roth returned to the campus
and the Daily announced its intention to find some means
to bring a completely modern structure to replace ye olde
Assembly Hall here on the campus.
Al Roth, friend for many years of Stanford students,
who has watched the campus grow in recent times, is going
<o hold immediate conferences with all interested parties
vitally concerned in the project to determine exactly what
the campus requires in a theatre and just how soon that
theatre can actually be built.
Mr. Kolli points out the fact that in the past, the Asso
ciated Students have very successfully co-operated with
the Administration in providing a basketball pavilion and
a fund for the upkeep of the Stanford I 11 ion, by assessing
themselves one dollar per quarter. The Hoard of Trustees
has enjoyed working with the students in this connection
and has appreciated the interest shown in thus building a
greater Stanford.
There apparently is no reason why Stanford should
not have a new theatre very soon if the students should
decide to provide it as their gift to the University. Merely
because the University today is using its entire income for
necessary purposes is no reason why the A.S.S.I". should
not take the initiative.
After all, alumni, faculty, students, Hoard of Trustees
they are all one, and working for the same interests.
We are looking to the future.
