# WHY IT'S NEWS
## California's Strikes 
### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
Around Sacramento state highway
police and sheriff's deputies are pa
trolling the strawberry fields. An
other of California's numerous ag
ricultural workers' strikes has brok
en out. There will probably be many
more before the year is out. Why
are there so many of them?
California leans pretty heavily on
agriculture, its largest industry.
Most of the produce must be sold
in the East and Middle V/est, which
means a long and expensive freight
haul to market. To sell the produce
in any quantity, prices must be kept
low.
The combination of high freight
costs and low selling prices has
meant low wages for warm workers
in this state. Long ago, ii was found
that Mexicans, Japanese, Chinese,
and Filipinos were willing to work
for little and were jusl about as ef
ficient as the white labor asking
higher wages.
As a result, Mexicans and Filipinos
have moved in in droves; they and
their families form about 75 per cent
of California's migratory farm labor.
Under the present circumstances ihe
state's agriculture seems quite de
pendent upon this foreign labor.
Strikes, Organizers
Four years of bad times forced
prices way down. Being unable to
reduce their taxes and mortgages,
farmers had to take the difference
out in wages. These were cut as
much as 65 per cent. Things go to
the point where many families were
actually starving.
Bad times and hungry men are an
ideal soil for discontent. Last year,
strikes popped up all over the map.
Papers wondered why; most work
ers were illiterate, poorly organized.
They soon found out. A Cannery
and Agricultural Workers Industrial
Union had been formed. Experi
enced labor organizers had organized
the workers, taught them not to use
violence, let the county authorities
do the dirty work.
No Real Settlement
Last fall things came to a head in
the cotton pickers' strike. li, was
settled and the pickers got half of
what they wanted. But the method
of settling strikes lasts just for the
season; they happen all over again
the next year. Why?
To begin with, the county authori
ties arm the land owners; the super
visors issue no-picketing edicts. This
divides people into two absolutely
opposite camps—those against the
workers and those for them; the for
mer are nearly always the ma
jority.
Sooner or later, strikes and vio
lence occur. Outsiders offer to medi
ate the strike. An impartial board,
therefore one ignorant of the real
facts, goes to work. They know in
advance that their decision must be
a compromise if there is to be any
peace. The announced decision
pleases no one, but the workers go
back to work, which was, after all,
the main objective.
But the root of the strike is still
there, and another strike over the
same conditions occurs the next
year. With conditions as they are,
this is almost inevitable. Optimists
are looking for a way out. Let's hope.

WASHINGTON, April 12 (TP). —A
bill to pay depositors the money they
still have tied up in closed or re
opened banks was bound up in a
parliamentary dispute which may
prevent a vote at this session of Con
gress.
