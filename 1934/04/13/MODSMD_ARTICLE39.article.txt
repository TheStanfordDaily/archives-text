A baby was born in San Francisco.
The layette, day and night nurse,
and a few other incidentals cost al
most $2,000. Annie Laurie, the Ex
aminer's professional tear-jerker be
wails the prospect that soon it will
be a penal offense "to bring an im
mortal human soul into the world."
Refusing to engage the gray
haired sob sister in a dialectic on the
immortality of the human soul, we
join her in wailing. We bemoan the
fact that it is not a penal offense to
grant to every Tom, Mary, and Bess,
not only the right to be born, but
what is still more—a birth-right.
Sadly enough, on the basis of the
San Francisco blessed event, most
babies are picked up at fire sales.
And aside from b'jing strictly against
the NRA, bargains in babies have
been even more troublesome than
cheap socks and cut-rate garden
hose. Most modern states have re
fused imbeciles and assorted half
wits the right to bear fire-arms. Yet
almost everyone is granted the right

to bear potential murderers, mani
acs, and crooners.
To make the costs of raising chil
dren prohibitive is not the ideal ap
proach to birth control. But until
the wiseacres stop birding poor Mar
garet Sanger, a money restriction is
better than no restriction at all.
At least it would stop overpopula
tion of slums, and a drain on the
government's treasury. Millionaires
can take care of their own idiots.
And if would-be parents with I.Q.'s
over 110 could be given rebates on
hospital fees, the system would be
still more attractive.
What most people want is not
large families, but much pleasure.
The falling birth-rate proves that.
But the birth-rate is still too high.
Insane asylums and movie audi
ences prove that. In the absence of
thoroughgoing birth control meas
ures, higher cost of . babies is a na
tional necessity.
Babies, once conceived in sin, then
in heaven, should now be born on
bankrolls. —Dave Mellinkoff
