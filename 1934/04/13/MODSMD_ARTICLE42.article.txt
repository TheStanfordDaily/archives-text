### Alexander Wocllcott 
Viking Press, New York, 11)3-1
In whatever capacity the reader
most appreciates the many-faced Mr.
Woollcott, he will find pleasure in
this delightful collection of the best
writings of his favorite raconteur
of America. For here Woollcott'ap
pears as a purveyor of gossip, anec
dote, and humor, a commentator on
plays and personalities, and a re
■ creator of mystery, legend, and hor
ror.
But no matter what his type,
Woollcott is equally facile, and what
strikes the reader perhaps most of
all is his uniquely apt choice of
words, and his fortunate manner of
expression of his ideas
This characteristic appears per
hap.s most noticeably in the section
entitled "Some Neighbors," in which
Woollcott draws portraits oi such
contemporaries a.i Dorothy Parker,
Kathleen Noiris, Paul Robeson, and
Joe Cook. That of Mrs. Parker is
especially delightful and is a for
tunate collection of all the best
known Parker anecdote s.
"It May Ti«_ Human Gore" is the
title of another group of the sketches,
and these are as entertaining as the
title. In various other portions of
the book Woollcott's fondness for the
; bloody tale appears, and he makes
; them all interesting reading.
All in all, a collection of yarns
well worth having, written with fine
lightness of touch and a deftness of
literary style which is too rarely
! matched. —Chapin
