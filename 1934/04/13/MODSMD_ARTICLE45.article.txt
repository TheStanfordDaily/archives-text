# MOULIN ROUGE (20th Century) At the Mountain View Theatre
## 
### 
Here is a picture with merits all
the superlatives in any reviewer's
vocabulary, and 1 frankly find mine
inadequate.
In the first place, my outstanding
recollection of the film is Constance
Bennett in a brunette wig, singing
something about coffee and kisses,
in an all-too-intimate close-up. But
no ordinary brunette wig, this; it is
the longest, blackest, straightest, and
least becoming wig of any color ever
to obstruct a silver screen. (Which
is saying a good deal.)
The dialogue is similarly outstand
, ing, a typical moment being Fran
chot Tone's insipid murmurings
about "You are a great artiste,"
while burying La Belle Bennett in
foolish kisses.
The story deals half-heartedly
; with a wife who doubts her hus
band, and whose husband (as he
should) doubts her singing ability.
She has the fortune to meet up wi'th
a singer who,looks like her, and who
obligingly trades places with her,
in order that she may win back fond
husband and convince him she can
sing. (!) Someone has likened it to
, "'The Guardsman," which is some
thing of a delicate insult to all con
cerned with the latter.
The only redeeming feature of the
whole tiresome business is the ad
mirable and charming performance
of Tullio Carminati, who sings
briefly, but who in addition gives a
wholly engaging interpretation of
the theatre manager.
Miss Bennett is—words fail me —
i Miss Bennett. —Chapin
