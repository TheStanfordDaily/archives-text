# Bears to Meet S.F.U. Track Team Tomorrow
## 
### 
A good forecast of the Big Meet
will be in store tomorrow afternoon
at Berkeley, where California's new
track team will meet the San Fran
cisco University outfit. Dink Tem
pleton's Stanford tracksters trounced
the city team by a 3 to 1 scoring
margin last Saturday, and the
I strengthened Bears, under Coach
Brutus Hamilton, may do as well.
The Blue and Gold should sweep
in the great majority of the points
in the running events, but the com
petition in the field will be much
closer. Frrd Walts, if he runs the
440, looks like the Dons' only prob
, able winner on the track, although
Stith of S.F.U. may nose out the
. Bears' Charvet in the low hurdles.
! With Wisler of the city team chas
' ing him, Bob Kiesel will endanger
| all records in the dashes.
