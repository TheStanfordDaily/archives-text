# Winged"O" Tracksters Face Cards Today
## FORMER STANFORD MEN BEAR BRUNT OF BLUB SCORING Eastman, LaBorde, Jones, Hables, Bright Compete 
### Jack Drown 
Lot! by such track and field lumi
naries as Ben Eastman, Here La-
Borde, Bobby Jones, Les Hubles,
Norman Bright, Ed Waterbury, and
Hank Coggeshall, Coach Charley
Hunter brings his Olympic Club
cinder artists to Slanford tomorrow
to face Coach Dink Templeton's
spiked-shoe perfoimers in what is
apt to be a much closer contest than
many experts believe.

Stanford should win the meet if
all of Templeton's performers come
through as they can. However, two
Card stars and possibly three will
be unable to compete due to in
juries. Phil Williams, premier In
dian broad jumper, will not enter
because of a leg injury and Bill
Beatty, Stanford's next best javelin
tosser may be out for the remainder
of the season with a bad arm.
Howis Arthur, Templeton's finest
high jumper, possibly will favor a
pulled leg muscle and not suit up.
With the Big Meet with California
only a little more than a week away,
Dink is not taking any unnecessary
chances with his men.
Cards Should Win
Even in the absence of these three
stars, the Cards can win the meet
without a great deal of trouble if the
following men perform as they are
capable of doing.
Thorns must repeat his March 10
performance in the all-University
meet and score a double win over
Hables in the dashes; A1 Blackman,
the Card's 47.8 seconds quarter
miler, should win his specialty from
the Olympic Club trio of Sam East
man, Don Blackman and Art Rice
thus giving the home team five more
points.
In the two-mile, Dave Devlin,
Stanford speedster, ought to win
here and Chuck Nimmo, great Card !
miler, probably will repeat his vie- :
tory over Clarence Hoist and Norm
Bright of a month ago thus adding
10 more digits to the Indian total.
Meier vs. Klopstock
Both hurdle events should afford
Captain Gus Meier and Sam Klop
stock, the two great Card timber
toppers, an opportunity to place one- I
two, particularly if A1 Herbert, the !
Winged-0 ace and former Stanford '
star, is in no better shape than he
was in the all-University spectacle, j
thereby giving Templeton's team 16 !
points.
The pole vault should afford Bud
Deacon an opportunity to display |
his prowess and the auburned- :
haired Stanford star ought to easily j
win to give Stanford five more |
points. Mottram will hook up with
Waterbury, the Winged-0 star in
the javelin, but the Card star has
defeated him once and should do it
again.
Joe Burris ought to place second 1
to Blazing Ben Eastman in the half
mile, while Schween, Card lath ar- ;
tist, is capable of at least a second j
in the high jump, should Coggeshall I
display his old-time form. The Club
strength in the broad jump is an un- j

known quantity, but unless Hunt
er's boys upset all dope buckets here,
Paul Zaches, Card performer, who
has yet to regain his last year's form,
should cop a second at the outside.
