# FROSH MEET BEAR NINE AT BERKELEY TOMORROW
## 
### 
The Stanford freshman baseball
team will be at its season peak to
morrow when it plays the Univer
sity of California yearlings on Ed
wards Field in Berkeley. But that
peak in all probability will not be
enough to upset the powerful Beat
nine in the second game of the an
nual little big series.
Last Saturday in the first game,
Stanford looked good—for seven in
nings. They maintained a 2-2 tie
during the early stages of the game,
and this alone served to eliminate
most of their inferiority complex.
Then the Indian Babes blew up and
California easily won, 10 to 4.
Show Improvement
Coach Ernie Nevers' team has
looked better in practice so far this
week than at any other time during
the season. Fielding has approached

| smoothness, and the hitting has been
better.
Tomorrow's game may develop (
I into a pitching duel between Alan- i
son Davis of the Cards, and Art i
Rinnes victorious moundsman for
the Bear cubs in last week's contest, j
Davis worked on the mound for the j
i first seven innings and received good j
| support. The infield relaxed and j
j bobbled the ball three times when j
Bill Quade and Russell McClure re- I
lieved him.
Lineup Named
The remainder of the Stanford
lineup will include either Louis
Tsoutsouvas or Mike Ferro, catcher;
George Ferris, first base; Web Jones, j
second; Howell Turner, third; Ar- i
cher Zamloch, short; Walt Chouteau, j
A1 Brent, and Horace Blackman, i
out-field.
