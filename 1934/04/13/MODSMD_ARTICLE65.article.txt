BIG NIGIIT
FOR SPLASHERS
Tonight is the big night for Coach
Nort Thornton and his squad ol
Stanford swimmers when they act
as hosts to the greatest array ol
aquatic stars assembled for one meet
on the Coast this year. Thornton is
experimenting with a new angle, at
least for Stanford, as this will be the
first night swimming meet ever
staged on the campus.
Known as the Annual Stanford
Swimming Relays, the meet involves
three classes: colleges and clubs,
junior colleges and college freshmen,
and high schools. Twice previously
the meet has been staged, both times
with considerable success, but even
greater interest is anticipated this
year due to the fact that an unusual
number of stars have entered.
APPEALS TO SLENDER
STANFORD PURSES
With students admitted free and
women especially invited, the relays
offer a pleasant and inexpensive v/ay
of spending the evening, especially
with some Palo Alto moving picture
prices being what they are.
Record holders and champions ga
lore will perform tonight.
An old friend of Stanford swim
ming fans will return to the Farm
when Ted Wiget represents the
Olympic Club forces tonight.
The diving events, always favor
ites with spectators, will feature
more than their share of stars. Ed
Throntlson, former Stanford captain
and 1930 National Intercollegiate
diving champion, will have as com
petition Rufus Rucker of California,
Pacific Coast Intercollegiate title
holder; Elton Stone, Fairmont Swim
ming Club, Pacific Association cham
pion; Dick Heating, Fairmont; Dan
Kuhn.s, California freshman who
won his event in the Northern Cali
fornia team championships; and Tom
Boothe and Milt Friedman, mem
bers (jf the present Stanford varsity.
Claude Diaz, Olympic Club's fa
mous comedy diver, will also be on
hand.
TEAM COMPETITION
TO BE STRONG
Competition for points between
teams will be stiff with most of -the
strong swimming outfits of the bay
region entered. In the Class A group
Stanford will vie with California,
Olympic Club, Lakeside Swimming
Club, Athens Club, San Francisco
Y.M.C.A. reserves, and Fairmont
Swimming Club. The Indian Pa
pooses have their work cut out for
them in meeting California frosh,
San Jose State, Santa Maria Junior
College, Menlo Junior College, and
Long Beach Junior College in
Class B.
Long Beach High School, South
ern California champions, arc fa
vored to take the Class C title, but
will have to argue with a number of
northern schools, all of them cham
pions of their respective leagues.
