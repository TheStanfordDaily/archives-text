# Varsity Batsmen Meet Bears Tomorrow
## CARDS LOOK FOR WIN ON BERKELEY BASEBALL FIELD Three Pitchers Wait For Call to Mound 
### Mort D'Evelyn 
Coach Harry Wolter's varsity
i baseball nine will enter their third
game with the Gulden Bears of Cali-
I fornia tomorrow afternoon on Ed
wards Field following the Cal track
i meet without the tenseness that has
characterized their past play. Cal
sewed up tha league title with their
4-2 victory over the Indians Tues
day, so both teams can play the
carefree type of game that makes
, college ball games interesting io
! watch.
Cards Only Hit
Wolter admits that he "never saw
a ball club which tried harder to
beat itself." The Cards have done
! everything in the hitting line but
beat the Bears. In the first game
they connected for 10 hits and Tues
day managed to nick Lefty Hardt
for seven bingles, one a triple. Good
pitching games by the Stanford hur
lers have been wasted when errors
gave the Bears easy tallies. How
i ever, playing on one of the finest
Intercollegiate ball diamonds in the
country and with an infield combi
nation that is getting to work better
together in each contest, Stanford
can well expect a reversal of form
in the fielding department.
Who will open in the pitchers' box
for the Indians was still undecided
last night. A wire to Wolter from
Fred Heringer, who was called home
last week because of the death of a
' member of his family, stated that the
Card chuckcr will be back on the
Farm today, but whether he will be
ready to pitch against the Bears to
morrow is questionable.
Campbell May Start
Johnny Campbell, the recent jun
ior college transfer, showed plenty
of control and a good change of
pace yesterday afternoon, and might
possibly open. The third possibility
is the veteran Stan Anderson, who
pitched and batted such a great game
against the Bears last Tuesday.
California's Clint Evans will un
doubtedly start Bill Peterson, an ex
perienced right-hander who got the
credit victory for the first Cal-Stan
ford ball game.
