# ALPHA DELTS, CAPITAN MURAL WINNERS
## 
### 
Pulling a fast finish, the Alpha
Delts last night swept out of their
first half slump and buried Break
ers under an avalanche of baskets
and foul shots, 18-15, gaining their
third straight victory and reaching
the finals in competition for the Uni
versity championship.

Breakers' usual excellent team
work clicked in fine style all the first
half, building up a 13-4 lead, but
couldn't stop the second-half drive
the Row men put on.
El Capitan outplayed Encina 4W
in all departments, taking the long
end of a score of 27 to 8.
