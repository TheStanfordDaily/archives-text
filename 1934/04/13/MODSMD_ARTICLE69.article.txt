# 'Big Shots' Catch Rabbit
## 
### 
It took six men and one dog, but
they did it, and now the rabbit's
name is Oscar and he is going to be
El Campo's mascot.
It was over on the green meadow
between the polo practice field and
the army grounds that "Sunshine"
McClure turned up the rabbit and
"Champ" Caballero, the boxer ;
showed some nifty foot-work and
Charlie Emerick, the soccer player,
tried out some of the latest dribbling
tactics, and "Tricky Dick" Arm
strong, the pitcher, threw his bat
and mit with slight effect; but it was
"Skippy" the army dog that un
raveled the fleet rabbit's tv/ists and
turns and slowed him down so that
Sammy Lee could half-volley him
over to where "Dainty" John Miller

him up and calmed him down.
Miller placed the bunny, quiet,
but determined-looking, in the rum
ble seat of Emerick's roadster, and
the El Campo intramural hard ball
team resumed practice, predicting
that Oscar will be its lucky rabbit
in the coming season.
