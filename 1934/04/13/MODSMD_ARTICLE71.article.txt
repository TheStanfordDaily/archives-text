# CITY ALL-STAR TRACK TEAM TO MEET PAPOOSES
## 
### 
The High School of Commerce,
which has won top honors in San
Francisco prep track for the past
school generation, as well as having
won numerous relay carnivals, open
prep championships, and various
spring festivals, will present the
stiffest competition to Stanford frosh
cindermen when the City All-Stars
come to Angell Field tomorrow
morning.
Commerce has, as usual, a re
markably well-balanced team. Le
win, Ligouri, and Moriarity in the
shorter races, and Gordor and Jor
dan in the mile have placed high in
every meet this year. There is also
Leaf, a six-foot high jumper, and a
couple of able weight men.
Varoff Goes Up
Balboa will bring their pride,
George Varoff, in the pole vault, io
whom 13 feet is a mere warmup. The
Bucs also have some fast middle
distance men.
Little Bill McGuire of Poly will
show the frosh sprint hopes, Fred
Williams and Alex Faye, a real time,
and as he has been clocked in the
nice prep time of 9.8 recently, should
break the tape in both races.
Freshmen Chuck Voigt and Green
look like eight points at a crack in
the 440, as both are consistent in
running around the single turn at
very close \o 50 flat, with Green
hugging the faster Voigt till the fin
ish. There are a couple of fast half
milers in the high school ranks, but
it is doubtful whether any prep can
take the measure of Frosh Bob Al
exander, while the condition of Bill
McCurdy, Bob's running mate, is
still a question mark.
Throw Small Shot
Shot-putters take it easy tomor
row, in throwing a 12-pound ball
instead of the usual 16-pound sphere,
so a distance of some 53 feet will
be of no great moment. Jim Rey
nolds, George Bergman, and Chuck
Ledbetter are big-shot-putters of
the freshmen, opposed by Sid Lipp
man from Lowell High.
In the high jump, Frosh Coach
Ellington has a new find in Tupper
Anthony, backed up by Mike Gon
zales and John Moller. The preps
have Leaf, and Luisetti of Galileo -to
clear the bar.

spring festivals, will present the
stiffest competition to Stanford frosh
cindermen when the City All-Stars
come to Angell Field tomorrow
morning.
Commerce has, as usual, a re
markably well-balanced team. Le
win, Ligouri, and Moriarity in the
shorter races, and Gordor and Jor
dan in the mile have placed high in
every meet this year. There is also
Leaf, a six-foot high jumper, and a
couple of able weight men.
Varoff Goes Up
Balboa will bring their pride,
George Varoff, in the pole vault, io
whom 13 feet is a mere warmup. The
Bucs also have some fast middle
distance men.
Little Bill McGuire of Poly will
show the frosh sprint hopes, Fred
Williams and Alex Faye, a real time,
and as he has been clocked in the
nice prep time of 9.8 recently, should
break the tape in both races.
Freshmen Chuck Voigt and Green
look like eight points at a crack in
the 440, as both are consistent in
running around the single turn at
very close \o 50 flat, with Green
hugging the faster Voigt till the fin
ish. There are a couple of fast half
milers in the high school ranks, but
it is doubtful whether any prep can
take the measure of Frosh Bob Al
exander, while the condition of Bill
McCurdy, Bob's running mate, is
still a question mark.
Throw Small Shot
Shot-putters take it easy tomor
row, in throwing a 12-pound ball
instead of the usual 16-pound sphere,
so a distance of some 53 feet will
be of no great moment. Jim Rey
nolds, George Bergman, and Chuck
Ledbetter are big-shot-putters of
the freshmen, opposed by Sid Lipp
man from Lowell High.
In the high jump, Frosh Coach
Ellington has a new find in Tupper
Anthony, backed up by Mike Gon
zales and John Moller. The preps
have Leaf, and Luisetti of Galileo -to
clear the bar.
