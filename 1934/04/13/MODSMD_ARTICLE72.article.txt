# SPEC STEWART. TO HELP GARBS IN GOLF MEET
## 
### 
When the Stanford golf team
members tee oif in tHe Northern
California Amateur which starts to
morrow at the Orinda Country Club
at Berkeley they will be reinforced
i by Spec Stewart whose entry in the
tournament came as a surprise. He
was expected to rest after winning
the Southwest Amateur last week
end.
With Edwards' and Giddings' re- I
cent victories over Jack Hocrner, '
the squad has shown the power of
which it is capable. The margin, of
(he victories were very small and
scores 011 all matches were under j
75., This shows that Stanford can j
match any other competition at the 1
tournament despite the fact Lawson ,
Little is now on his way to England.
I The biggest opposition that is to
! be found at Orinda is Charley Sea- i
ver, the ex-Stanfordite who is re
turning to defend his title which he
won last year.
Probably Stanford's ace in the
hole will be Moses who learned to
swing on the Orinda course. His 08
over Orinda, made last year, estab
! lished him with the lop rank of
Bay golfers. Jim has not been shoot
( ing so well this quarter but may
respond to the stimulus of playing
| his home course.
Of the freshmen, Howard Clark
1 and Bob Welch may break into the
championship bracket. Welch has i
an especially good chance as he is
used to the Orinda type of course.
