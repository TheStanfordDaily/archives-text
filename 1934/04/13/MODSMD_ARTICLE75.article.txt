# FRANK SPEAKS ON AMERICA'S FUTURE IN ASSEMBLY HALL
## Calls Revolution Evolution If Well-Directed 
### 
Speaking forcefully, Dr. Glenn
Frank, president of the University
of Wisconsin, yesterday afternoon
held spell-bound a large audience
that filled the Assembly Hall to hear
his discussion on "The Renewal of
America."
Introduced by Dr. Edgar E. Rob
inson of the Department of His
tory, Dr. Frank at once launched
into his subject.
Abreast Test
"Any one test of the greatness of
a civilization is its ability to keep
its institutions abreast of it^ 1 scien
tific and technological development."
Elaborating on this statement, he
went on to say that we are going
through a period today that is the
result of a cultural lag on fhe part
of the present-day institutions.
This period is one of change, he
pointed out, and one of two things
may happen as the result of this
change: forces may be damned up
by inflexible tradition until revolt
occurs, or they may be directed
into the proper channels by flexible
intelligence.
Necessary for Future
"Our entire future and fortune
depend on the outcome of such a
condition," he emphasized, "and I
am convinced that the America of
lomorrow will be drastically differ
ent from the America either of yes
terday's textbooks or today's news
paper. What it Ls depends on who
wins."
Concerning the possibility of
America's "drifting" into Fascism
or Communism, Dr. Frank ridiculed
the idea, saying that no nation drifts
into such a complete and drastic
change.
Intelligence Needed
There is the possibility, however,
of eventual revolt, if the American
patience is exhausted. Distinguish
ing between actual revolt and revo
lution, he said that revolution is un
avoidable and advisable "if we mean
by revolution, evolution under the
guidance of intelligence, unchained
by tradition."
Speaking of the Roosevelt admin
istration, he stated that he believed
the mass mind was willing to follow
responsible statesmanship, but that
the people expect intelligent, con
structive, and permanent results to
follow the granting the president
unprecedented freedom to act.
Warns of Worse
If these results are not forthcom
ing, the people will choose something
else, he warned, probably less de
sirable.
Concluding his speech with an
appeal to youth, Dr. Frank said the
pi-oblem of the present generation
is to see that the change through
which we are passing takes place
through inflexible intelligence from
without, uninfluenced by inflexible
tradition.
