With a cover in spring colors, the
April issue of the Illustrated Review
will appear on the Quad today
bringing news to alumni and to stu
dents of the forthcoming homecom- .
ing celebration next week and as
just one of its many features.
Included in this issue are articles
on Dink Templeton and the track
team, written by Gus Meier; another
sports page by Joe Cough lin on his
tennis years at Stanford; and a fea
ture by Bernarr Bates on the his
tory of Lagunita.
The recently drawn-up Commis
sion for Student Aid is announced
in the magazine this month, with the ;
by-laws published in full. The Pres
dent's Report is also reviewed edi
torially, and another section tells of
the successful Alumni University
held here last month.
"Ambassadors in the classroom"'
is a feature in which the work of
Professors Payson Treat and Yamato
Ichihashi is discussed. New features ;
in the School of Education are re
ported in the issue by Dean Grayson I
Kefauver, while other news of the
faculty is contained in the story on
Summer Quarter plans.
Harlow Rothert's page on news of
the campus and of alumni activities,
and altogether an issue has been
published which should not fail to
interest all students. Copies on the
Quad sell for the special price of
15 cents.

Freshmen at Gunnison College are
required to walk backwards while on
the campus.

Stanford students, contrary to the
popular theory, are not speed de
mons any more than permanent
residents of Palo Alto.
"Ordinarily," said Police Judge
John Springer, "we cannot complain
of Stanford students' driving."
Judge Springer's court keeps a
careful check of all speeding cases
which indicates that the offenders
can be grouped as: outside women,
outside men, Stanford men, Stan
ford women, Palo Alto men, Palo
Alto women. During the first half
of March, Stanford women speed
sters averaged three miles an hour
more than roughs, but this is un
usual.
Judge Springer explained that the
students' record is lowered by bad
periods in October and June, when
enforcement reaches a peak twice
as high as in January.
"The excitement of leaving home
and coming to college," smiled the
judge, "seems to make the students
drive wildly for a month before they
learn the rules; and when they think
of going home again in the last week
of finals in June they get excited
again and drive too fast."
