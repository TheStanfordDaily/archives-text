# Mexico's Scenic Beauty Impresses Roth On Trip
## 
### 
Greatly impressed with the high i
; caliber of represeniative Mexican j
; citizens and the evident Rood feel
ing toward the United States shown
there, Comptroller Almon E. Roth
yesterday returned from Mexico
j where he attended the district con
; vention of Rotary clubs of Mexico
i as representative of the Interna
i tional Board of Directors.
Leaving Stanford March 30. Roth
i traveled by boat to the tropical part
; of Mazatalan on the west coast of
Mexico just off the lower tip of
California. He was especially im
â€¢ pressed by the scenic beauty of the
| country os seen from the boat.
Returns by Rail
: His return trip, made by rail by
i way of Nogales and Tuscon was
i largely through rugged mountain j
| and desert country.
Noticing "a greatly increased in
-1 terest in Mexico as evidenced by the
I great number of tourists," Roth
i made especial mention of the adop-
I tion of modern methods of agricul
ture, travel, and communication to
j be found in the cities of the United
States' southern neighbor.
About fifty of the delegates to the
convention, Roth said, traveled by
airplane, showing the advance in
aviation in Mexico. From Durango
alone, 20 representatives attended by
j use of planes. A trip which other
! wise takes two weeks by horseback
j across mountainous territory was 1
j thus made in an hour and a half.
L. A. Popular
While in Mazatalan Roth inquired ,

of a number of Mexican youths as
to where they learned to speak Eng
lish and found that many had been
trained in Los Angeles, Southern
California being equally accessible
as Mexico City. A number of the
delegates have children attending
school in California. One man has
a son whQ is planning to come to
Stanford.
One of the most interesting inci
dents of his trip, Roth said, was the
seeing of two tame boa constrictors
in the court of the hotel in Mazata
lan. The huge snakes are kept to
kill frogs, mice, and other rodents
in the courtyard garden.
