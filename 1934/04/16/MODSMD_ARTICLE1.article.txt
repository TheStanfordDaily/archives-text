# LYMAN'S MARK UNOFFICIAL AS WORLD RECORD
## 'Noteworthy Performance' Unrecognized as Throw Not in Competition STANFORD WINS 83-48 Ben Eastman Leads Nimmo To Tape by 30 Yards 
### Jack Drown 
Staging the greatest performance
in the history of the event, John
Lyman, the Card's human cannon,
last Saturday in the Stanford sta
dium, heaved the 16-pound shot 53
feet 6 inches to crack all unofficial
existing world's records. Lyman's
great put was made on his four
teenth throw and was the highlight
of the Stanford-Olympic Club meet
which Stanford won by an 83 to 48
score.
Although Lyman's mark can not
be accepted as a new world's record
because it was not made during his
regular competitive tosses, coming
on the fifth of the six heaves
customarily given winner of events
by colleges in this locality. It will
be listed in the books as a "note
worthy performance," until he offi
cially shatters Douda's now recog
nized world's record of 53 feet l\k
inches.
Remarkable Puts
Perhaps the most remarkable part
of Lyman's performance was the
fact that the Cardinal star during
his 14 throws, put the iron ball past
the 51-foot mark just 13 times. Seven
of his great throws traveled over
52 feet. He won the event at 52
feet 10 7 />. inches and then went on
to establish his remarkable mark of
53 feet 6 inches.
Naturally Lyman's record-break
ing achievements overshadowed
other performances, but the return
to competitive form of Blazing Ben
Eastman in the half mile, which he
negotiated in the time 1:52.4, thereby
giving the Olympic Club one of their
four first places, gave the small
group of spectators plenty of thrills.
Ben Eastman Runs
Chuck Nimmo, after loafing
tnrough a 4:49.1 mile, tried his hand
at the 880, but Eastman was far too
much for him and led "little" Nim
mo to the tape by 30 yards. How
ever, Chuck was clocked in 1:56.9,
which serves notice that he will
probably compete against the Cali
fornia half-milers next Saturday in
the Big Meet.
The much-heralded duel between
Mottram and Waterbury failed to
result in any new records, but the
Stanford star with a throw of 211
feet 6% inches was more closely
pressed to win by the Olympic Club
ace than in their former meeting,
Waterbury heaving the spear 209
feat 1' 2 inches Saturday.
Card Hurdlers Win
In the hurdles, Stanford reigned
supreme Saturday. Sam Klopstock,
Stanford's rising sophomore star, ran
a great flight of highs to cop the
event from Captain Meier in the
good time of 14.7 seconds. However,
Meier came back a half hour later
to reverse the procedure when he
ran a fine 220-yard low hurdle race
in the excellent time of 23.6 seconds.
A1 Blackman of Stanford proved
to be the only double winner of the
meet. The Card quarter-miler won
this event in 48.9 seconds and then
defeated Thorns, who had previously
won the 100-yard dash for Stan
ford, and Hables, the Olympic Club's i
best, over a 220-yard course in the
time of 22 seconds flat.
The only other events won by the
Olympic Club in addition to the
half-mile were the broad jump, j
which was taken by Baldry with a
leap of 22 feet 10% inches, the two
mile, won by Hoist in 9:47.5 min
utes, and the discus, which Here
Laßorde threw 158 feet 10% inches
for a victory.
