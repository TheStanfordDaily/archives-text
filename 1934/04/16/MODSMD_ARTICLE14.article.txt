# Bid Offered Quad Buyer
## Holder of Lucky-Ticket Will Be Admitted to Ball 
### 
A free bid to the Masque Ball
which takes place on Friday evening
in the Pavilion will be awarded
some purchaser of the 1934 Quad
who buys the annual anytime be
tween this morning and Thui'sday
noon, says Business Manager Hal
Whitfield.
A drawing from the numbered
stubs sold in this four-day interval
will be held at 12 o'clock Thursday
in front of the post office. The win
ner, holding the corresponding num
ber to that drawn, will attend t'ne
Hades Ball absolutely free of Aarge.
The number of Quads has been
diminishing rapidly during the last
few weeks, says Whitfield. Since a
limited number of the books has
been ordered he advises that all
those who intend to buy do so as
soon as possible as they may find
themselves without a book in the
final rush. He points to the example
of last year's sellout.
A drive of the halls is expected to
be made this week. Quads sold there
as well as those in front of the post
office from 8-12 o'clock today, Tues
day, and Thursday will be included
in the di'awing. The price of the
book is $5.65, or $6.15 with the name
engraved on the cover. Seniors who
have paid their ยง1 photograph as
sessment will have this subtracted
from the price.
