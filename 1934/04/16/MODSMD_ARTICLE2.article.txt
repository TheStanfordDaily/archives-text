Lee's Story

"We were going south on Tenth
Street, at a moderate speed, when
we saw a car coming from the left at
Howard Street. Milt tried to slow'
down to avoid the crash, but could
not quite make it.
"I found myself on the sidewalk;
Hinkely and Emerick also were
clear. Milt was pinned behind the
wheel. I don't know how I was
thrown from the car unless I went
through the roof of the roadster."
While three companions were re
