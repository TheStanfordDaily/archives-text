### 
Adoption of the new constitution '
hangs in the balance, with student {

8:30 to 2 o'clock at the Law steps,
with evex-y regularly enrolled stu
dent eligible to ballot.
Following the voting, a meeting
of the election board will be held at 1
2 o'clock in Room 240 to determine

Everyone Must Vote
"The nature of the vote makes it i
imperative that everyone cast a bal- j
lot," commented Joe Chamberlin, j

chairman of the election committee.
Every Stanford student will be af
fected by the provisions of the con
stitution, he explained, and should
take part in deciding as to its ac
ceptance or rejection.
The document, long needed to re
place the antiquated legal code now
governing the University, brings
local student government up to date.
A1 Denney, Crompton Bangs, Abe
Mellinkoff, Gerald Trautman, and
Jeanne Millard began work last No
vember. Officials of the Law School
and Political Science Department
have lent their aid in final formu
lation of the revised constitution.
. Kropp Approves
Miriam Kropp, secretary of the
Student Body, voices complete ap
pi-oval. ''It is well suited to the needs
of our Student Body; I think it cer
tainly should be adopted" is the
opinion of this official.
Les Hables, student manager, re
marks that little of the material con
tained in the body of the constitu
tion is "in my field," as all financial
matters are contained in the by
laws, but agrees that "the major
part is much needed. The old con
stitution was inadequate—that can't
be denied. All its discrepancies and
omissions seem to be corrected. I
consider the work cntiirely satisfac
tory, and plan to support it."
One dissenting voice, Elinor Kalm,
presents opposing views: "The con
stitution as written contains so many
flaws that I can only attempt to
present them by means of a cam
pus opinion in the next issue,"

Student Body, voices complete ap
pi-oval. ''It is well suited to the needs
of our Student Body; I think it cer
tainly should be adopted" is the
opinion of this official.
Les Hables, student manager, re
marks that little of the material con
tained in the body of the constitu
tion is "in my field," as all financial
matters are contained in the by
laws, but agrees that "the major
part is much needed. The old con
stitution was inadequate—that can't
be denied. All its discrepancies and
omissions seem to be corrected. I
consider the work cntiirely satisfac
tory, and plan to support it."
One dissenting voice, Elinor Kalm,
presents opposing views: "The con
stitution as written contains so many
flaws that I can only attempt to
present them by means of a cam
pus opinion in the next issue,"
