### CHARLOTTE BURRIDGE 
Presentation of a plan for revision of the late-leave system Mill bo
made at Women's Conference at the Clubhouse at 1 o'clock today. II
accepted, the new regulations will make it possible for women to be out
until 2.: i() o'clock without specifying that their destination is an hour's
distance from the campus. Greater liberality in the use of leaves is also
advocated in the proposition.

The conference, composed of pres
idents of all women's living groups,
will hear the revision and present
the matter to their respective houses,
which will vote on the proposition,
Representatives will then be in
structed how to cast the group's vote
at the following meeting. A majority
of Women's Conference is necessary
to adopt the plan.
To Be in By-Laws
Upon acceptance of the new A.S.
S.U. constitution, the revised social
regulations would become part of
the by-laws.
Following a thorough study con
ducted by Dean of Women Mary
Yost, the proposed changes are de
signed to better adapt late-leave
regulations to the convenience of
the students. Data compiled by the
research committee headed by Alice
Klauber, reveals no need for en
larging the number of leaves.
Clarifies Rules
Only 54 women used over 18 late
paises during the fall quarter, in
cluding both week-ends and niid
weeks, statistics show. The average
total number of leaves during fall
quarter'was between three and eight
for all undergraduate women.
Advantages of the new arrange
ment are to clarify the regulations,
making them more explicit, and to
give more freedom in the individual
use of late-leaves. Abolition of the
1:30 o'clock pass on week-ends for
engagements less than an hour's
driving distance from the campus is
aimed to grant more liberality.
While allowing more freedom in
the use of leaves, the new regula
tions will place greater restrictions
on women whose scholastic standing
is below a C average. There will be
no differentiation made between
women on probation and those be
low C.
