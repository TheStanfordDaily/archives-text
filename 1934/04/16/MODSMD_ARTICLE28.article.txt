# Don't Be Reactionary

The Daily lias listened with much interest lo remarks,
both pro and eon, about the proposed A.S.S.I'. constitution,
which is up for adoption by the student body at tomor
row's special election. Most of the comments, frankly, have
been derogatory, which in itself means little.
Where people are satisfied, thev seldom applaud.
Where they are annoyed, they scream loudly - and fre
quently without just cause. In a majority of the few cases
brought to light, they do not have cause.
When, after six months' preparation, the document is
submitted to the dean of the law school, Professor Marion
It. Kiikwood, and to one of the nation's greatest authorities
on political science, Professor Edwin A. Cottrell, and those
men place their stamp of approval on it, the Daily believes
llial the constitution is good enough lo demand tlie favor
able recognition of the voters. The two professors also
assisted in the preliminary drafts.
I ndoubtedlv, some of the changes cause people to balk.
That is natural. The combination of the women's organi
zations under one A.S.S.I'. constitution will serve to elimi
nate many loose ends which are confusing. The same rea
soning is applied to the doing away with unimportant
classes.
One argument, that undergraduates only should be al
lowed on the Ex Committee, cannot be recognized. Stu
dents in the higher education departments pay their dues
and are entitled to a voice in the government. If the un
dergraduates were willing lo sacrilice between $1000 and
$1800 a quarter through non-payment bv the student alum
ni, that would be a different matter.
The sponsors' argument, which will be opposed at a
later time by several prominent men, is probably the only
real argumentative point in the constitution. These lead
ers, realizing the need of something to replace the anti
quated set of rules under which we now work, are willing
to forego their opposition on behalf of a progressive in
strument which will allow flexibility and force. If they
will, so can the others.
