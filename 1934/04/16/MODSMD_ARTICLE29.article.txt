# Action Ahead

While students get together with Comptroller Roth and
Director Helvenston this week in order to determine ex
aclly what type of structure Stanford requires when it
comes to the erection of a new theatre on the campus, it
is an excellent time for (he A.S.S.I*, to be thinking of a
definite means of getting that theatre here very soon.
People have been talking about it for many, many
years, and several ideas have been advanced. The most
elaborate of these, calling for a gigantic memorial tower,
a memorial court, and imposing theatre, will require in
Hie neighborhood of $370,000, no small sum. The adoption
of this plan, though, will involve the use of some $170,000
on hand this year in the present War Memorial and The
atre Funds. Nevertheless, an imposing balance remains to
be supplied.
The Hoard of Trustees has found that co-operation of
students and the Administration has proved a very satis
factory way to build toward a greater Stanford. Student
money paid a good share of the basketball pavilion, and
today is still providing about $7,000 annually toward the
expense of the Stanford I'nion.
Hefore a complete ballot is drawn up for the spring
election, it would be a good idea for campus politicians
to do something concrete for the t 'niversity try drawing up
an adequate plan of action and letting the students vote
on a proposed student-financed theater for Stanford.
