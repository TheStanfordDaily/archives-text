"The Pleasures of Book Collect
ing" will be the subject of a talk
by Earle Vonard Weller Tuesday
evening, April 17, at 7:30 o'clock in
the Assembly Hall. A well-known
book collector himself, Weller will
tell of the interests found in book
collecting and of the many experi

ters as he searches for rare books.
Weller has a very fine collection of
Keats. He is the author of '.'Keats
and Mary Tighe." The "Autobiog
raphy of John Keats," his latest
book, was recently published by the
Stanford University Press. The
frontispiece of this book carries a
reproduction of a miniature of John
Keats by Charles Hayter (1761-
1835) which is now in the possession
of the author.
The participation of Weller in the

entitled "The Bible: Its Translations
and Printings." Another lecture on
the subject of books will be de
livered by Professor Hardin Craig,
chairman of the School of Letters,

A campaign is being waged by
