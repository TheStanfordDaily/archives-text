# A 						Pleasant Taste
## 
### 
The Third Annual Stanford Swimming Relays will hold
an important place in the memory of some two hundred
odd athletes from universities, junior colleges, and high
schools who took part Friday in Coach Nort Thornton's
swimming classic. And not because of the first-place med
als that they may have won, but because of the friendship
and the good time they found at Stanford.
These two hundred athletes represented twenty-three
teams that came to Stanford from nearly every section of
California. And back with these twenty-three teams went
the memory of a day of clean sport, keen competition, and
the hospitality of Stanford.
The Relays were a success from the spectator's stand
point also, as about 1200 students who jammed the Encina
pool bleachers Friday night will testify.
Now if the Swimming Relays have proved so popular,
why can't the field be enlarged a little to include a tennis
tournament, or a golf tournament, or a basketball tourna
ment or track relays? In fact there is almost no limit to
the possibilities.
Such athletic events give high school and junior college
athletes an opportunity to see Stanford and carry home
with them a pleasant impression of Stanford students and
tlie Stanford campus.
Advertising is a good thing if it is of the right kind.
And Stanford for some years back has not been unwilling
to accept publicity of the proper type. Any affair such
as the Swimming Relays gives Stanford just that kind of
advertising that can help her most. 11 leaves a pleasant
taste in everyone's mouth, the visitors, the Stanford stu
dents. and the controllers of Stanford money bags.
