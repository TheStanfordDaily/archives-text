# BULL SESSION
## DEMOCRATIC WAMPUM FOR STANFORD INDIANS 
### 
Since grammar school civics clas- J
ses, we have been told that there is >
graft and gravy in government. We i
have been taught to sneer at the
grafters and the gravy lappers. In
fact, we have been so busy sneer
ing that we have had practically no j
time to do any thinking. The air
has been so thick with impassioned i
denunciation of corruption that all
have assumed that graft, like the
devil, is something we talk about, 1
and never experience.
But the great illusion has van
ished. Active government and ac
tive gravy have rolled home to Stan
ford. No longer need we have merely <
an academic interest in the vagaries ,
of federal and state gravy. Now we i
know it in all its viscous splendor.
New Dealei's pulled a few blue i
chips out of the national treasury for |
the relief of the starving and the I
needy. This was not charity but a
chance: real work for real wages.
There should be no under-fed babies j
and destitute widows in America. !
The Big Chief commanded, and 10,
the heavens rained gold!
A little trickle of that national
shower-bath, a $4500 trickle, reached j
Stanford's destitute. Stanford har- j
dies, obviously not starving, ;.«nd j

probably with very few crying
babies to support, cashed in on U*i
cle Santa Claus' benificience. The
CWA was putting men back to work!
These Indians got stiff backs mowing
lawns, thumb callouses from index
ing library books, and fallen arches
from running errands for professors.
National recovery was proceeding at
a rapid pace.
True, there was still a little dis
comfort in the land. Nine million
men were still out of work, and an
old woman in San Francisco was
starving because she could not get
$5 a month to live on. So the SERA
stepped in and donated $4500 more
to lecture-attending, dance-attend
ing Indians. The picture was very
rosy.
It is sometimes a little harrowing
to think of taking $SOOO out of the
mouths ol' half-starved would-be
workers. It is also sometimes inter
esting to talk of the greedy grafters
who are raiding the treasury, and
bankrupting the nation. But when
the golden dollar, or even the rub
ber dollar, appears* on the local hori
zon, we are all a bit inconsistent—
not to say greedy and grafting. No.
1 is the only one. If national recov
ery ever comes, it will come in spite'
ol our efforts. —Dave Mellinkoit
