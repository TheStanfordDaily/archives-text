TIIE MIKADO (Gilbert-Sullivan)
At the Palo Alto Civic Theatre
It is extremely difficult to juclge a
performance of any Gilbert and Sul
livan opera, because one is at once
hypercritical and uncritical—hyper
critical because of the difficulty of
performing a well-known work, and
uncritical because of the abiding
charm of the lyrics and the music
and their happy combination.
"Uneven" perhaps "best character
izes the recent local production ol
"The Mikado," which was in parts
weak, in parts excellent, and in
whole a satisfying performance.
The laurels for the evening are
divided between the orchestra and
Margaret Fallenius. The orchestra,
though small, never once seemed in
adequate, and Eli.se Zazunian Be
lenky's direction of the score was
spirited and sympathetic.
Miss Fallenius surpassed the other
members of the cast in every de
partment, and her Katisha was de
lightful. Her poise, her comedy, and
particularly her fine voice, made it a
memorable performance.
Poo-Bah was made the outstanding
male figure by the cleverness of
Ervin Best, who pointed his comic
lines and songs to good effect. De
spite a bad make-up, John Springer
was a good Mikado.
Gene Bone gave a sincere inter
pretation in Nanki-Poo, and Doro
thy Duryear was vocally adequate
as Yum-Yum. Elma Evans was ex
cellent in a minor role.
As Ko-Ko, George Dewey was
most unsatisfactory, with incessant
bobbing, milling, and pitching all
over the stage. He muffed lines,
spoiled "Tit-Willow," and was ag
gressively clownish. —Chapin

THE (TAT AND THE FIDDLE
(MGM)
At the Mountain View Theatre
Even a rather silly him such as
this cannot efface the impression that
Jeanette Mac Donald, in addition to
being a capable and attractive ac
, tress, is the outsanding screen prima
! donna.
MiSs Mac Donald, as the successful
i young song writer, completely car
f lies the burden of this film version
1 of Jerome Kern's musical comedy,
and were it not for the monstrous
finale she might dupe one into be
lieving that this is a good picture.
As it is, the impression is. that of
a pleasantly mediocre film, which
I is, however, far better than the
usual formula-type musical picture.
Kern's music is still good music, and
1 Miss Mac Donald does right by it,
particularly by "The Night Was
Made for Love."
The story concerns two song
writers (the other being Ramon No
| varro) whose love affair has con
siderable trouble getting under way
! and even more trouble reaching its
devoutly wished consummation. The

obstacles (a) Novarro is poor, (b)
Novarro is unsuccessful, (c) Novar
ro is pifcud, and (d) Frank Morgan.
Novarro (who, as you may infer,
has considerable to do with the
whole affair) gives a consistently
namby-pamby performance, vary
ing between ecstatic rapture and
picturesque despair. —Chapin

The laurels for the evening are
divided between the orchestra and
Margaret Fallenius. The orchestra,
though small, never once seemed in
adequate, and Eli.se Zazunian Be
lenky's direction of the score was
spirited and sympathetic.
Miss Fallenius surpassed the other
members of the cast in every de

lightful. Her poise, her comedy, and

Poo-Bah was made the outstanding
male figure by the cleverness of
Ervin Best, who pointed his comic
lines and songs to good effect. De

Gene Bone gave a sincere inter

THE (TAT AND THE FIDDLE
(MGM)
At the Mountain View Theatre
Even a rather silly him such as
this cannot efface the impression that
Jeanette Mac Donald, in addition to
being a capable and attractive ac
, tress, is the outsanding screen prima
! donna.
MiSs Mac Donald, as the successful
i young song writer, completely car
f lies the burden of this film version
1 of Jerome Kern's musical comedy,
and were it not for the monstrous
finale she might dupe one into be
lieving that this is a good picture.
As it is, the impression is. that of
a pleasantly mediocre film, which
I is, however, far better than the
usual formula-type musical picture.
Kern's music is still good music, and
1 Miss Mac Donald does right by it,
particularly by "The Night Was
Made for Love."
The story concerns two song
writers (the other being Ramon No
| varro) whose love affair has con
siderable trouble getting under way
! and even more trouble reaching its
devoutly wished consummation. The

obstacles (a) Novarro is poor, (b)
Novarro is unsuccessful, (c) Novar
ro is pifcud, and (d) Frank Morgan.
Novarro (who, as you may infer,
has considerable to do with the
whole affair) gives a consistently
namby-pamby performance, vary
ing between ecstatic rapture and
picturesque despair. —Chapin
TIIE MIKADO (Gilbert-Sullivan)
At the Palo Alto Civic Theatre
It is extremely difficult to juclge a
performance of any Gilbert and Sul
livan opera, because one is at once
hypercritical and uncritical—hyper
critical because of the difficulty of
performing a well-known work, and
uncritical because of the abiding
charm of the lyrics and the music
and their happy combination.
