## Subsistence Homesteads 
### CROMPTON BANGS Jr 
Many opponents of the New Deal i
I think they have at last found traces
I of communism—of all places, in the
; Department of Interior. The cause
! of this agitation is the subsistence
homestead. What is one, anyway? j
A subsistence homestead is a piece
of land (under 10 acres) developed
j and improved with a modern house
by the government. They are sold
| for around $2,000; the buyer has 20
j years to pay—which comes to about
i $8 a month. Pretty easy terms even
i in these days. • I
The Purpose
These homesteads are sold to fac- ;
tory workers who are jobless most !
of the time. The idea is for thein to
raise their own food; they are not ;
allowed to sell any of it.
i So far, the projects started have
i all been near industrial centers with j
| chronic unemployment. These home
steads will take quite a few families
off public relief. When the men do
get work, they can spend their wages
I on things they can't raise.
Last year the NIRA appropriated j
25 million for this experiment. So ,
far about half of it has been allotted.
Each group of homesteads usually
| includes 200 small farms on rather
poor land. Much of the get-ready
I work has been done by CWA work
; ers. Families are beginning to move
: onto the land, raise their* own food.
Some Difficulties
But everything is not running ;
I smoothly. The chance for chiseling i

and graft is always found in any
thing like this. As the government
must buy up local unused farm land,
real estate men have tried to out
guess them, get the land first, and
then ask a stiff price. Local mer
chants get together and try to sell
all the supplies at an enormous
profit. These things have held back
homestead development so far.
There are still other things to
look at. Farming is no easy job;
nearly all the subsistence home
steaders are factory workers; they
know next to nothing about farm
ing. True, they can iearn, but that
takes time; it may cost more money
while they are learning. Then local
farmers howl; they will sell less
produce to the relief agencies; they
are afraid the homesteaders will
sell vegetables on the sly, cut their
throats.
Has Good Points
If this idea can he worked out so
it will not cost too much, it will
take care of a big part of the unem
ployment problem. The whole 25
million now in the till will take care
of only 12,000 families. The U.S. is
expected to have at least two million
jobless families for the next genera
tion. Even if we can weed out
greedy merchants, real estate men,
graft, it will still cos! plenty. But it
may be worth it. It is at least more
American and more effective than
giving a man a grocery order and
two days' work on the woodpile. It
certainly isn't communism.
