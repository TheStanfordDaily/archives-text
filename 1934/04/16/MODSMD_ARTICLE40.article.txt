### Millard Browne 
Even more decisively than pre

Long Beach Polytechnic High School
stole the aquatic show in the Third
Annual Stanford University Swim
ming Relays in Encina pools Friday
night.
Scoring victories in four of the five
Class A events, and second place in
the fifth, Coach Nort Thornton's In
dian swimmers had little difficulty
in turning back what was figured a
distinct Olympic Club and Lakeside
Swimming Club threat to win the
first place trophy for the third
straight year with 23 points.
Lakeside Second
Lakeside was second with 11, and
the California varsity surprised fans
by beating the Winged-O entry in
the third place fight with nine digits.
Olympic clubmen scored seven, Ath
ens two, and San Francisco Y.M.C.A.
reserves two.
Placing in every event and win
ning three races, Long Beach was
equally prominent during the eve
ning. The Southern school accounted
for 20 points. Other Class C scores
were: Sequoia High of Redwood City
10, Lodi High 6, Palo Alto High 5,
Galileo High of San Francisco 4,
Santa Maria High 3, Berkeley High
3, Tamalpais High of San Rafael 2,
and Long Beach Puly second team 2.

gram with a Stanford victory in the
400-yard free style relay. John Ken

sprint relay.
Two Thrillers
The last two events on the Class A
progi'am, however, were thrillers.
Jack Bergman, Gifford Myers, Holly
Fitting, and Clark ran a neck-and

Foster, and Gardner barely lost out
to the Olympic Club in the closest
