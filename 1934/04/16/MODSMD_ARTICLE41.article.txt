## LYMAN HEADS CARD WEIGHTMEN 
### 
Johnny Lyman's magnificent toss
of 63 feet C inches with the 16-pound
shot. Saturday afternoon, which un
officially broke the world's record
advances him to the head of the il
lustrious class of weightmen who
have been developed in the past
decade under the tutelage of Dink
Templeton here at Stanford. Since
1924, Cardinal shot and discus men
have topped the nation's weight tos
sers with few exceptions.
Just K) year ago "Tiny" Hartranft
was, with Bud Houser of U.S.C., the
outstanding weightman in the coun
try. Houser's specialty was the dis
cus while Hartranft was usually
victorious in the shot, holding two
decisions over the Trojan that year.
That was the Olympic year and in
Paris, Houser shaded Hartranft to
gain his only victory over the Car 7
dinal, "Tiny" taking second and also
accounting for sixth in the discus.
