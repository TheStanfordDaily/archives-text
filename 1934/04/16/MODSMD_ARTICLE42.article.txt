# KRENZ BEATS ROTHERT BY HALF AN INCH
## 
### 
For a couple oi years, Stanford
weight tossers sank into the back
ground, even failing to win the shot
put in the Big Meet. Then in 1927,
''Biff" Hoffman pushed himself into
the headlines and became 1.C.4-A
champion in the discus as well as
being a threat in the shot all year.
Hoffman finished that year, but
was succeeded in 1928 by Eric Krenz,
one of th'*' greatest of all Stanford
athletes. As a sophomore that year
he set new 1.C.4-A records in both
the shot and discus with his team
mate, Harlow Rothert, just a hall
inch behind him in the former event.
Krenz' marks were 50 feel 1 inch and
154 feet 11 inches.
That was another Olympic year
and Krenz went to Amsterdam to
take fourth in the shot. Unfortu
nately he fouled and went unplaced
in the discus. The next year he set
a new world's record in the discus
of 3G3 feet 8 7 Â« inches, and in 1930,
just one week before his mark of
the previous season was accepted, he
stepped out and cracked it by four
feet with a throw of IG7 feet s : ;s
inches.
