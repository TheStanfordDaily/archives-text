# KRENZ DEATH GREAT BLOW
## 
### 
The great Stanford star was be- |
lieved capable of even better marks '
after his college career, but in an 1
accident at Lake Tahoe that sum- ;
mer he was drowned.
Harlow Rothert had teen some
what overshadowed by Krenz, but
he was also one of Stanford s great
est stars, setting up an intercolle
giate record in the 1.C.4-A meet of
1930, and taking second in the shot
at the Olympic Games in Los Ange
les in 1932.
From 1931 to 1933 the trio made
up of Nellie Cray, Here Laßorde,
and Bobby Jones made weight his
tory, Gray and Jones winning I.C.
4-A championships and Laßorde
taking a place in the discus in the
Olympics of 1932. Jones and La-
Borde, who are both throwing for
the Olympic Club this year, were
believed capable of reaching the
world's record Paul Jessup set up
when he broke Krenz's mark.
Neither have done so yet and it may
be possible that Slinger Dunn, the
latest addition to the Stanford line
of weightmen, may do it.
