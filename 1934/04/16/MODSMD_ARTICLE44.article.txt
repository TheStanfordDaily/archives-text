## 
### 
Lyman is apparently coming into
his own at last. As a high school
.star at Santa Monica he was hailed
as the greatest prep star ever de
veloped in Southern California, and
us a freshman at Stanford he was
counted on to become one of the
school's greatest.
For two years he was overshad
owed by Gray, Laßorde, and Jones,
hut last year he and Gray divided
honors, and at the 1.C.4-A meet Ly
man established a new record. His
mark Saturday wins him a definite
place in the long line of Stanford
weight stars, and although unofficial,
it is expected that he will set up a
new official world's record before the
season ends. —Tremaine
