# Almack Will Talk Tonight
## Teacher Tenure Is Subject Of Radio Speech 
### 
Teacher tenure, cause of many a
battle between leaders in the field
of education, will form the center of
discussion for Dr. John Conrad Al
mack when he faces the KPO mi
crophone tonight at 7:45 o clock in
this week's edition of the Stanford
University Hour. Dr. Almack, who
is professor of Education at the Uni
versity, is noted as one of the coun
try's foremost authorities on edu
cational subjects.
All conditions of employment
among the teachers of the country
are dealt with by teacher tenure,
according to Dr. Almack, but in a
more limited sense it has to do with
a teacher's transfer or removal from
position.
Fourth Year Crucial
California's teacher tenure law at
present makes permanent any teach
er who is hired for his or her fourth
year in any particular school sys
tem. Consequently, the majority of
school boards refuse to hire any
teacher for the fourth year for fear
that they might not be able to re
lease that teacher if they think it
necessary some time in the future.
The right kind of tenure is as
much in the interests of the public
as of the teachers, believes Dr. Al
mack, and the teacher should be
given security in position and pro
tection against injustices of the
spoils system.
Laments Conditions
â€¢Dr. Almack says that it is regret
table that present conditions are so
far from the ideal, in view of the
values which might be realized from
stable conditions of tenure.
Dr. Almack will discuss defects in
the present law in the light of re
sults obtained by tenure laws in op
eration in other countries, and
through an analysis of these defects
point out how the present law might
be changed in order to attain more
nearly ideal conditions for the
teacher.
