# U.C. BASEBALL TEAM DEFEATS STANFORD, 6-5
## 
### 
Some of the classiest ball yet
played by Harry Wolter's Card nine
went nought in the last half of the
tenth inning at Edwards Field in
Berkeley Saturday afternoon v/hen
Billy Hallauer's hard single to left
scored Smythe from third and gave
California a 6-5 win, their third over
the Indians in as many starts.
Stanford's fielding was much im
proved over their past games with
the Bears, and the Indians made
their hits count, scoring five runs on
eight hits and leaving but six on the
bases, against 11 for the Bears. What
gave further spark to the Card
showing at the plate was the hitting
of Captain Dick Miles, who came
out of a long slump to garner three
hits in five trips to the plate, also
driving three of the Stanford runs
across the plate.
Stan Anderson, Wolter's depend
able right hander, resumed where
he left off Tuesday when he opened
his third game against the Bears
this season. Anderson pitched
through eight innings, and while the
Bears managed to collect eight hits,
the veteran chucker kept the bingles
well scattered and was responsible
for but four of the five runs scored
while he was in the box. Fred Her
inger pitched the last two innings,
with Gallison and Daoust dividing
the pitchers' box for Cal, each hurl
ing five innings.
The Indians started out well in
the first when Art Heam and Mort
Nutting scored by way of Bones
Hamilton's sacrifice and a hit by
Miles. One in the third and two in
the fifth, driven across by Galbraith
and Miles, completed the Card scor
ing for the day.
