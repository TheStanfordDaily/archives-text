# WATER FUNFEST SET FOR FRIDAY
## 
### 
With tlie annual Junior Water Carnival only four days oil, plans for
the year's biggest aquatic show are rapidly nearing completion.
Expecting the Class of l!)3s's spiash fest to outshine all previous carni
vals, lioth in events and trophies, Committee Chairman Jim Triolo an- j
nounced that besides merchandise for individual stars, two big trophies j
would be put in competition—one for the winning's men organization and
one for the champion women's group.

These victory trophies, which will
be put on display at the Stanford
Bookstore as soon as they arrive on
the campus, are larger and more
valuable than any competed for in
past years.
Urging immediate filing of entry
blanks, Triolo pointed out that sev
eral competitive events, particularly
Ihe men's canoe tilting, will be open
only to a limited number. No swim
mers who are not officially entered
in the meet may compete in certain
events. Competition is open to any
students in the University, but those
who intend to vie for prizes in eight
events must mark entry blank??
printed on the first page of the Daily,
and turn these in tonight. Blanks
will be collected at house meetings
by men appointed by Ben Cave and
Gordy Mallatratt, and in sororities
by women appointed by Helen Ray.
Those who do not belong to houses
may turn in their entry blanks at
the A.S.S.U. office. Any entrant may
compete in an unlimited number of
events.
Girls Hide Dolphins
"Riding the Dolphin" relay teams
are composed of four girls who will
swim 25 yards each on "dolphins."
The men's "Nightshirt Relay" teams
are composed of six men, who will
swim 25 yards each in nightshirts—
they will pass the nightshirt, in
stead of the baton. Relay teams may
sign up with only one blank, the
marking only the name of the or
ganization and the relay race which
it wishes to enter.
The following have accepted invi
tations to officiate at the meet: head
judge, Harry Maloney; judges and
timers, Nort Thornton, Ray Wilbur,
Jr., John Bunn, Myron Sprague,
Gordon Mallatratt; starter, Austin
Clapp; recorder, Jack Hanson.
Honor guests who have been in
vited include Mr. Herbert Hoover,
Dean Mary Yost, Dean George Cul
ver, Dr. Bertha Dyment, Professor
Thomas Bailey, Harold Helvenston,
Harry Wolter, and Lee Chapin.
Carnival Traditional
The Water Carnival is a tradi
tional spring program, composed of
competitive and exhibition events,
sponsored by the junior class. Usu
ally it is held in Lagunita, but lack
of rain this year has forced the or
ganizers of the meet to move it to
Encina pools. The use of the smal
ler site, though likely to curtail ca
noe events, is advantageous to spec
tators, as they are thus seated nearer
to competitors. Admission to the
Carnival will be free.
In addition to competitive events
printed on entry blanks on page one,
such special laugh - provokers as
Professor Flopuel Q. Zilch and His
Man Thursday, "Classic of the Cen
tury," and a breaststroke "grudge"
race between Captain Bob Clark and
Bob Foster have been scheduled. .
