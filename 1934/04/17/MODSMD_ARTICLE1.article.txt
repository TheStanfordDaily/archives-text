# LEA VES REVISED BY 14 TO 8 VOTE OF CONFERENCE
## Changed Social Regulations Accepted by Living Groups; Abolition of 1:30's, Weekly Regulation Win in Balloting 
### CHARLOTTE BURRIDGE 
Accepted by a 14 to 8 vote of women's living groups last night, revised
social regulations will become effective with the beginning of the fall
quarter. .
Opposition of Roble Hall, which commands live votes, was counteracted
by the approval of Union unit with seven. Six sororities were in favor of
the new plan as compared with three opposing houses.

As president of A.W.S., Jeanne*
Millard, cast the fourteenth vote fa
voring the revised regulations. Pi
Phi's, who did not have a represen
tative at the Women's Conference
yesterday morning, learned of the
ballot and added their "yes" vote at
a late hour last night.
Intensive Study
An intensive study of dating by
# women students, made possible by
CWA funds has been carried on by
the Dean of Women's office. Statis
tics gathered by the committee re
veal a close correlation between the
number of late leaves used and
scholarship. Over half the women
now on probation took more than 18
late leaves last quarter.
As a generalized conclusibn the
sorority with the highest number of
late leaves had the lowest scholar
ship record. The research also
showed that the average number of
leaves used was between three and
eight out of a possible 26 for fresh
men and 39 for upper classmen,
thus denying any need for greater
number of late leaves.
Opponents' Case
Opposition to the plan was based
• on the belief that the new arrange
ment would place greater limitations
on the use of leaves by restricting
the number of 2:30 o'clock passes
per week, instead of the present
system of unlimited late leaves on '
week-ends.
The proposed plan as presented to
the living groups last night was ap- j
proved by Dean of Women Mary
Yost before her departure for the i
East. The only changes made dur- j
ing the Women's Conference yester- ,
day afternoon was the additional re- i
striciton that freshmen may not use |
more than one of the quarter's quota '
of five late leaves during any week,
and the granting of late leaves to
participants in off-campus debates.
