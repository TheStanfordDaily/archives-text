# Duckings, Dumpings, Spills Promised in Water Fete

### 
While refusing to promise that
Eleanor "Hey Hey" Harris, potential
Masque Ball Queen, will again fall
from a canoe, Junior Water Carnival
officials maintain that this Friday's
Amphibian Follies will more than
equal last year's show in all other
respects.
Although numerous entry blanks
were marked and turned in at fra
ternity and sorority house meetings
last night, there is still room for
many more swimming, diving, and
special-event stars. Entries will be
received today and tomorrow, and
entry blanks will appear in tomor
row morning's Daily.
King and Queen of Friday night's
Masque Ball will go through a cool
ing ceremony in Encina pool prep
aratory to their roasting task at
Rally Committee's Hades in the eve
ning. As rulers of the Junior Water
Carnival, they will spend a watery
afternoon devoted to royal proces
sions.
Interfrateinity rivalry is centering
i.i two of Friday afternoon's events

-the traditional canoe-tilting pole
fest and the Class of 1935's own
brainchild â€”the nightshirt relay.
Since Encina pool can harbor only
a small number of canoes, entrants
iti this event will be chosen by lot.
The names of all who sign entry
blanks will be placed in Marshal
Ben Cave's official hat, and from
this, the final choice of entries will
be made.
Meanwhile, the already large
number of merchandise prizes for
individual winners in the feature
events is rapidly increasing. Boxes
of candy for feminine winners, men's
sweaters, merchandise orders, and a
total of 11 winners' awards have
already been contributed by Palo
Alto retainers, who have shown
their accustomed interest in this tra
ditional event. The following have
donated prizes: Frazer and Co., York
Music House, Phelps-Terkel, Stan
ford Theatre, Mink's and Sons, Wil
son's, Thoits. Rons Bros., Wideman's,
Miller's Clothes Shop, and Victor's
Barber Shop.
