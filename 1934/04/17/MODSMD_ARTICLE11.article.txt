# No! â€” And the Reasons
## EDITORIAL 
### 
Upon a closer scrutiny of the proposed A.S.S.U. Con
stitution which is to l>c voted on today, the Daii.y linds
the following weaknesses which it feels duty-hound to
present to the students:
1. The "C Average Clause" is in direct contradiction
to the administration's "Xo-Flunking" move.
The University, through its president and registrar, has
said that a student should he able to devote more time to
his chosen field of work without fear of being disqualified
because of deficiencies in other subjects which .were
brought on by exertion in that chosen held. Why, there
fore, should a person interested in dramatics as dramatics
manager, for example, be forced out of his office because
he saw lit to spend bis time and efforts in the development
of dramatics to exclusion of work in some required course?
2. Elimination of the "rotating membership' workings
of the present constitution will send an entirely green Ex
ecutive Committee into control at the beginning of each
gear.
There will be no hold-over members to give their back
ground, brief as it may be, to the incoming committeemen.
The average student will agree that, wtih some exceptions,
student body officers do not as a rule take the time to trace
down details. If they are presented to them by somebody
who has had the experience of participation in the activi
ties of the Executive Committee, they are in a better posi
tion to serve the students well.
No public hearing was held on the completed docu
ment.
Several members of the Ex Committee have admitted
frankly that a public hearing on the proposed instrument
should luwe been held so that many of the objections now
being raised could have been straightened out beiore the
voting was held. This point alone is strong enough to de
mand a reconsideration of certain ot the sections.
1. A re note etui be scheduled within a few weeks, and
wind changes the students feel are necessary can be in
corporated in the revised constitution.
While the Daily dislikes changing its attitude at this
late hour, it feels that more satisfaction will result and
that an enlivened student interest will, in the final out
come, produce a set of laws more agreeable to everybody
concerned.
5. The naming of class officers (or committees) and
sponsors by a few individuals will read more harmfully
than beneficially in regards to student control.
The Daily is completely in.accord with the idea of giv
ing as much control as possible to the students. I his, how
ever, is one of those things under the "as possible" part of
the above sentence. Students are not as well fitted as are
the deans to name sponsors, either men or women. Simi
larlv, class committees being named bv students will re
sult in the long run only in vote trading and spoils system
tactics.
(i. An opening for pocket vetoing of amendments is
provided in Article VIIf, Section I, subsection b, which
(dlows thirty days for the Executive Committee to submit
the proposed change to a .student vote.
In other words, better than one-ninth of the actual
school days can be taken for considering the proposition.
And, as in the case of the Daii.y editorship squabble last
May and June, a neat pocket veto can exist which denies
the students a right to be heard.

to the administration's "Xo-Flunking" move.
The University, through its president and registrar, has
said that a student should he able to devote more time to
his chosen field of work without fear of being disqualified
because of deficiencies in other subjects which .were
brought on by exertion in that chosen held. Why, there
fore, should a person interested in dramatics as dramatics
manager, for example, be forced out of his office because
he saw lit to spend bis time and efforts in the development
of dramatics to exclusion of work in some required course?
2. Elimination of the "rotating membership' workings
of the present constitution will send an entirely green Ex
ecutive Committee into control at the beginning of each
gear.
There will be no hold-over members to give their back
ground, brief as it may be, to the incoming committeemen.
The average student will agree that, wtih some exceptions,
student body officers do not as a rule take the time to trace
down details. If they are presented to them by somebody
who has had the experience of participation in the activi
ties of the Executive Committee, they are in a better posi
tion to serve the students well.
No public hearing was held on the completed docu
ment.
Several members of the Ex Committee have admitted
frankly that a public hearing on the proposed instrument
should luwe been held so that many of the objections now
being raised could have been straightened out beiore the
voting was held. This point alone is strong enough to de
mand a reconsideration of certain ot the sections.
1. A re note etui be scheduled within a few weeks, and
wind changes the students feel are necessary can be in
corporated in the revised constitution.
While the Daily dislikes changing its attitude at this
late hour, it feels that more satisfaction will result and
that an enlivened student interest will, in the final out
come, produce a set of laws more agreeable to everybody
concerned.
5. The naming of class officers (or committees) and
sponsors by a few individuals will read more harmfully
than beneficially in regards to student control.
The Daily is completely in.accord with the idea of giv
ing as much control as possible to the students. I his, how
ever, is one of those things under the "as possible" part of
the above sentence. Students are not as well fitted as are
the deans to name sponsors, either men or women. Simi
larlv, class committees being named bv students will re
sult in the long run only in vote trading and spoils system
tactics.
(i. An opening for pocket vetoing of amendments is
provided in Article VIIf, Section I, subsection b, which
(dlows thirty days for the Executive Committee to submit
the proposed change to a .student vote.
In other words, better than one-ninth of the actual
school days can be taken for considering the proposition.
And, as in the case of the Daii.y editorship squabble last
May and June, a neat pocket veto can exist which denies
the students a right to be heard.
Upon a closer scrutiny of the proposed A.S.S.U. Con
stitution which is to l>c voted on today, the Daii.y linds
the following weaknesses which it feels duty-hound to
present to the students:
1. The "C Average Clause" is in direct contradiction
to the administration's "Xo-Flunking" move.
