"Parliamentarianism as the form
of government in France might not
last the summer out," said Editor
Chester Rowell, in his talk on the
inadequacy of the present democ
racy to cope with Fascism and Com
munism.
The first of his series of weekly
lectures was attended by an appre
ciative audience of about 200 per
sons, few of whom were students.
After brief introductory remarks,
Rowell launched into a discussion
of the War, the condition of Europe
before the War, telling how it made
democracy forever safe for the
world, and how, today, there is not
one true democracy in the world.
This lecture served as an intro
duction to his course on Current
Politics and will be followed in his
next lectures by a discussion of ex
isting conditions in the world, today,
and of politics, and their ever chang
ing application to these conditions.
Contrary to custom, the course
will not be given for credit this
year.
