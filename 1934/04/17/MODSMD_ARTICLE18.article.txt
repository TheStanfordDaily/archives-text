# Jerry Trautman Makes Statement Urging Adoption
## 
### 
Student Body President Jerry
Trautman issued the following
statement last night, on the eve
of the election which will de
cide the fate of the proposed
A.S.S.U. constitution:
"I 'feel that tlie new consti
tution is so far superior to the
old, that any thinking student
would not compare the two.
This election today resolves
itself into either accepting the
new or repairing the old. Con
siderable opposition has been
aroused on various points, hut
it would seem that these are not
sufficient grounds for defeating
the proposed constitution.
"I, therefore, urge you to con
sider it carefully before you
vote 'no' on a constitution which
has met with unanimous ap
proval by President Wilbur,
Dean Kirkwood, and Professor
Cottrell.''
