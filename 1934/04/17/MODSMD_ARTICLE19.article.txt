With a couple of merry thish
thwadles and a hooty-hoo, Old Boy
Jim Algar emerged from behind his
long white beard with a threat of
the funniest Chappie in the funny
history of the ancient mag.
Recalling his own tintypes (espe
cially the one holding baby Oscar
and his derby) he has laughed him
self into a fine fettle over old tra
ditions, campus folklore, and "The
Poor Man's College." you like
your Quad foto?" he parried with a
sneeze. "We will reveal allâ€”just
how Quad pictures are made to re
semble the Kallikak family."
The May number of Chaparral will
clutter up the campus and numer
ous dentists office on next Thurs
day. A free copy autographed by
Dr. Wirt will be given to everyone
purchasing 366'4 Chaparrals.
