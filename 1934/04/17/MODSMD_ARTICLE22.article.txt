# Lack of Theatre Facilities Affects Dramatic Students
## 
### 
How important is the dramatic de
partment? How many students are
| affected by its lack of proper facili
ties?
A survey of enrollment, by major
subjects, reveals that public speak
! ing ranks with the top 18 as regards
popularity, topping such well-liked
courses as botany, civil engineering,
and pre-legal. Twenty-eight depart
ments arc listed as having loss ma
jor students.
Physics, with all its equipment and
elaborate laboratories, has only H
registered majors. The School of
Mining claims six. Even pre-legal,
I preparation for the famed Law
I School, lists 25, while public speak
| ei\s number 27.
Besides the actual class work, dra
matics includes extra-curricular ac
tivity in which many students par
ticipate. Its entertainment value is
not duplicated in any other depart
ment. Probably no other subject in
. volves more students, directly or

indirectly.
Cash income of the department,
over and above expenses incurred
in costuming and stage sets, reaches
a surprising total. Many of the ma
jor traditions of the University are
associated with yearly plays, "Gaie
ties," and similar events.
In spite of its status, the dramatic
department is not provided with
half the necessary equipment. Sub
jects claiming half the students are
supplied with twice the facilities.

becau>e of lack of space and ditu

According to Director Harold Hel
venston, the proposed theatre group,
which would, include class rooms
and a little theatre, would till these
requirements. The rest depends up
on the student body.
