# Two Cents

### 
Two cents won't even buy an ordinary postage stamp
any more. Standing alone, it doesn't have, a great deal of
purchasing power. Two cents—alone are limited in use
fulness to a couple of "pennies for .limmie."
Ordinarily we think of two cents us a pretty insignifi
cant amount. Hut pairs of coppers, piling up, very soon
make quarters, which is the price of a show, or four-hits,
worth ;i haircut!
More than thai, when two cents is added onto five, it's
shipping on a big percentage. Seven cents looks like a big
price to pay for an article that ought to sell for five.
The Stanford Union sells a half pint of milk for seven
cents, .lust 'how thoroughly out of reason this charge is,
i ' something which has perhaps rarely occurred to the
Stanford Rough who orders a glass of milk for breakfast
and lays down seven cents for it.
Half pints of milk bottled and delivered ready to be
shipped over the counter of the Cellar just before 8
(/clocks cost ontij two and a half cents.
That leaves four and a half cents, practically double
the original cost of the milk, to pay hashers to pull it out
of the ice-box and pour it into a glass.
Something is manifestly wrong. Most competitive busi
nesses can operate on a leeway of 50 per cent; tlie most
exorbitant never cross 100 per cent. There is no valid rea
son why th l T nion, with a monopoly, should need almost
200.
It is unfair to charge seven cents for an
article worth only a third that much. No sensible argu
ment can possibly be advanced against a new and fairer
price of five cents a glass for milk.
Such a price policy would not be peculiar to the Union.
It would rather be a belated conformity to a standard
which progressive eating houses have long since adopted.
Go down to Paly and drop into any creamery. Order
a pint of milk and the charge will be only seven cents—
just the price of a l\al[ pint if you prefer the privilege of
drinking it at the Cellar. Half pints, served with meals,
draw a nickel apiece.
Because the Union lias a campus monopoly is no rea
son why an unfair advantage of that monopoly should
be taken. The Cellar is run for the students, on their
money—they should benefit as directly as possible in-every
way. Certainly they should not have to pay more for their
morning milk from their own fountain.
Two cents is not very much, but two cents is riling just
on the principle of the idea. There's no rime or reason
in tacking 40 per cent worth of profiteering onto a nickel
glass of milk.
.Inst two cents —irksome, unfair, unjust.
