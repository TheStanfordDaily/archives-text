# They're Coming Home!
## 
### 
When Stanford alumni start flocking back to the Farm
this week-end, they will find plenty of fun and gaiety
awaiting them. Students are going to have a good time,
truly a novel one, when it conies to meeting the old grads
and showing them around today's campus and pointing
out HKVI highlights.
Juniors offer splashy entertainment with the annual
Water Carnival Friday afternoon in Encina pools; Rally
Committee follows with the spring social highlight, the
Masque Hall, that evening. Dink Templeton's men promise
excitement with the Hig Meet in the stadium Saturday af
ternoon.
With all this, there's more thrown in between the main
events. A football scrimmage, living group "open houses,"
faculty and departmental specialties, and alumni stag din
ners are but a few of the feature devents. . . .
The entire campus, imbued with the Masque Hall, Hig
Meet spirit, is going to enjoy itself immensely when it
throws heart and soul into entertaining alumni and them
selves . . . and forgetting who's supposed to play host.
That's how it should be.
