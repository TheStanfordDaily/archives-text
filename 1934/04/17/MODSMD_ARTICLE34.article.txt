# WHY IT'S NEWS
## F.R.'s Popularity 
### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
j Politics is a strange animal. Just
| now, with prosperity cpm'ng rather
! jerkily around the corner, the Presi
! dent's prestige is on the decline. Last
j March, with things at their worst,
j his popularity was at its height. Thus
| we must apparently conclude that
! more prosperity means less prestige
j for F.R. Why is this?
The reason for litis is not hard to
; find. A year ago, everybody thought
i we had too much of everything. This
must he so because nobody could sell
what goods he had. So most people
favored anything to get rid of over
production and anything to restrict
production in the future.
But in addition to restricting pro
duction, the Roosevelt program in
cluded measures to stimulate busi
ness by pumping out cash to labor
through the CWA and PWA, to
farmers through the AAA, to inves
tors by making profits possible
through the NRA. That these two
sets of ideas were inconsistent was
not realized at the time.
Business Bounces luack
Looking back, we see that two
things have happened. In spite of
violent opposition to the devalued
dollar, the CWA and PWA, these
have worked out as hoped, and now
have widespread support. This is
because they stimulate business.
On the other hand, the securities
act, proposed stock exchange bill,
the AAA and NRA are now very
much under fire. This in spite of the
fact that they were more widely ap
proved a year ago than the CWA,
etc. These measures are opposed
because they lend to restrict and
contract private business just when
chances for profits are greatest.
In other words, the country has
accepted the policies which stimu
late business, and it is more and
more dubious of those which re
strict it. Apparently the more effec
tive the stimulants the more the
controls of business will be disliked.
F.R.'s Achievements
Thus the President's leadership is
likely to decline in the future inso
far as he fails to take notice of the
present drift of opinion in favor of
less business control and more stim
ulation. If this does happen, he will
lose prestige as prosperity increases.
Even if F.R.'s prestige does de
cline, future historians will remem
ber him for three great things he did
in his first year in office. In the first
place, he gave the people Hope in
the darkest hours of March, ISIJ3.
Secondly, he gave the U.S. Action,
thus proving that recovery could be
speeded up by doing something
about it instead of twiddling our
thumbs. Finally, he raised the inter
national prestige of the U.S. greatly.
Through his actions, he established
the country as the leader in world
affairs, while stopping the drift to
ward war in Europe and Asia. That's
something to shoot at.
