GEORGE WHITE'S SCANDALS
(MGM)
The Scandals is a routine revue,
with George White himself acting as
master of ceremonies and with a
slight backstage plot at intervals in
place of eustomary "blackouts. The
lilm's chief virtue is its frankness in
not pretending to be something more. (
There are plenty of chorus num
bers, lots of elaborate costumes, lots
of Jimmy Durante and Cliff Ed
wards. By far the best number—
words, music, and action—is You
Nasty Man, sung by Alice Faye. Du- j
rante does an amusing blackface
number to end blackface numbers.
The gags throughout are the low
est and oldest of the current run.
Novelty songs with funny verses and
trick camera effects are stressed, but
they are too long and frequently
stupid. There is no good dancing.
Choruses are placed, for novelty, on j
steps, platforms, curtains, fans, !
around pools. Rudy Vallee's best
effort is The Man on the Flying
Trapeze.
There is a particularly potty Char
ley Chase comedy and a sport short j
on Indian lacrosse which is blood- ,
thirsty and amusing.
On the whole, a decidedly unim
pressive program. —Brauns

I BELIEVED IN YOU (Fox)
SEARCH FOR BEAUTY
(Paramount)
In "I Believed in You" Fox pre- ,
sents another in the long line of (
Hollywood productions which have
been spoiled by poor direction. What
might otherwise have been an en- j

tertaining play is completely ruined
by the kaleidoscopic manner in
which the theme is introduced, and
even the actors seem at times to be
completely befuddled.
Opening scenes present all the sit
uations commonly associated with a
problem play, a quick shift is made
to satire, and the remainder of the
opus is devoted to depiction of a
girl's awakening to the real values
in life. It would seem utterly fan
tastic to even imagine that a girl,
reared in cultured surroundings,
could be so totally ignorant of the
worthwhile values contained in the
field of art, but this ignorance and
her subsequent enlightenment form
the moving force of the picture.
The other half of a double bill is
"Search for Beauty," a picture which
has been widely advertised as con
taining all of the world's foremost
beauties, both masculine and femi
nine.
Little of this collection of beauty is
shown, and the picture outlines the
activities of two crooks who buy a
health magazine and try to turn it
into a gold mine by building up the
sex theme in its pages. Two Olym
pic champions are hired as editors
for the "front" they afford the pub
lication. The champions, who be
lieve in building the "body beauti
ful" through the medium of exercise
and proper diet, finally gain control
and virtue reigns triumphant.
Perhaps the only saving feature
of the picture is Jimmy Gleason,
who, with his droll humor, can in
ject spice into almost any production.
