## CONSTITUTIONS OLD AND NEW 
### 
The American mania for codifying
and constitutionalizing fundamental
laws began in 1787. Ever since the
group of politicians who gave us the
Federal constitution became known
as the "founding Fathers'' (in capi
tals), every Rotary Club and Sewing
League has felt itself obligated to
favor posterity with similar docu
ments. Ranking well above the clas
sification of Rotary clubs and sew
ing circles, Stanford too has felt tho
need for a constitution.

Most constitutions are made to be
written, and not read. Our Federal
code is an outstanding exception;
conceived in compromise, it wus ac
tually of interest to the people. But
Irom that time on, constitutions have
been the life bread of starving law- (
yers; to everyone else, they have j
been so much spinach and squash.
The old A.S.S.U. document joined !
the family of constitutional abortions J
("immature products"). It attempted
to tell everything to everyone, and i
ended up "explaining nothing in a j
very efficient manner. It went so far
as to reveal the startling fact that it !
'was the duty oi thr? secretary of the j
Association to keep A.S.S.U. min- |
utes. Its practical purpose was to !
insure chaos* guarantee ambiguity, I
and perpetuate discontent. Its most 1
notable provision was the provision j
for revision.

And so the revision committee,
comprising four constitutional fath
ers and one constitutional mother,
got busy. The result of their labors
is a document clear and concise. It
does not attempt to say everything;
what it says, is said plainly. A good
constitution should state lucidly the
broad, general outlines of student
government. That is accomplished.
The by-laws will comprise the many

details which concern only the sr
cial interests.

Working on the principal that too
many officers are a nuisance, the
committee effected consolidation.
When the new constitution is passed,
the simile: "as useless as a class of
ficer" will cease to exist. That rep
resents some progress.

The thing is by no means perfect.
But it represents such an improve
ment on the present affair that it
deserves passage. Amendments can
come later. Even the Federal con
stitution, which ranks next to the
Bible, was amended ten times imme
diately after ratification.

Vote the Constitution!
