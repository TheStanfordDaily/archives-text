GOLF
With the qualifying round being
played off by the end of the month
the eight low scorers will play for
the first cup ever offered at Stanford
for women's golf. The cup has been
donated by Mrs. Brent Potter, wom
en's professional.
Match play takes place the fol
lowing week-ends with Joan Mac
gowan, Dorothy Lyman, Mary Louise
Riley, and Clare O'Donnell prob
ably having the best chances for
winning lhe trophy. Joan Macgowan
has had a 92 and the other three
have shot scores in the higher 90's.
There are other good swingers, too,
who may (s>me through to make the
end uncertain.
ARCHERY
Stanford has a champion archer
in her midst in Kathleen Thorburn,
a twice gold medal winner in in
tercollegiate competition, wh ic h
means that she has shot over 400 for
the Columbia round (24 arrows at
50, 40, and 30 yafds each). Her best
mark is 444 in practice which she
wili try to better for the National
Intercollegiate Telegraphic archery
shoot in the middle of May.
The fact that the gold medal re
quirement mark has been raised to
425 should prove no obstacle to Miss
Thorburn who shot 446 last year.
A close contender is Judith Boyle
with a practice score of 427. Winona
Woon and Marion Parker have been
showing up well, too.
FIELD DAY
All eyes are looking forward to
Field Day, June 5, featuring individ
ual sports, closing the year with rep
utations for the lucky ones and fun
for everyone.
Preparation for Field Day and
events preceding it means a busy
time for Managers Jane Dearing,
golf; Winona Woon, archery; Jackie
Flanders, swimming; and Amelia
Baer, tennis.
More about tennis later, but it's a
fact that among Stanford's yearly
influx of new women there is more
than one who brings an amateur
standing along with her suitcase.
This year is no exception, and the
name on the tennis ladder would
look good anywhere. For the pres
ent the tennis club is scheduling
matches with other teams.
SWIMMING
Inter-class swimming meets will
be held next month. Practicing is
going on in the advanced classes in
preparation for the events. Kitty
Ahrens, sophomore flash, has been
practicing all year by herself in the
Encjna pools and ought to make
some records this spring. Her usual
warming up exercises consist of
swimming 36 lengths of the pool at
a time.
AN INTERESTED FACULTY
Hockey is becoming more and
more interesting to Stanford women,
banded under the Hockey Club. The
faculty has not a little to do with it.
Instigated by Mrs. Margaret Barr,
instructor in swimming and hockey,
and Miss Grace King, instructor in
practically everything but golf and
dancing, the Peninsula Hockey Club
for coaches and women out of col
lege was also formed last fall as pari
of the San Francisco Field Hockey
States Field Hockey Association,
Association.
They are planning to go to the
hockey camp in the Pocono Moun
tains, Pa., in the fall. This camp is
under the auspices of the United
with such internationally known in
structors as Hilda Burr, Constance
Appleby, director, and Joy.-e Cran
Barry.
Another convention attended is
Gertrude Hawley, instructor in ten
nis, etc., now en route to the meeting
of the American Physical Educa
tional Association in Cleveland.
Miss Hawley is retiring as the fac
ulty adviser of W.A.A. with Miss
King taking her place. Miss King is
new this year, a graduate of Welles
ley College and Brown University.
