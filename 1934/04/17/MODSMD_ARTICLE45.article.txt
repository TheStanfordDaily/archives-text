# Stanford Nine to Play League Champs at Berkeley
## RAY FORSYTHE OUT of game; Indians CRIPPLED BY LOSS 
### 
With the outcome of the game
having no bearing on either the con
ference championship or the outcome
of the California-Stanford series,
baseball nines of these two univer
sities will meet on lhe Berkeley
diamond today.
The Bears, who have dropped only
one game this season in conference
competition, have already annexed
the league title and won three out of
the five games in the Stanford series.
Each time when the two nines
have met the Indians have come
closer to victory. The first contest
was a washout as far as Stanford
was concerned. A week age, when
the Bears clinched the title in the
Sunken Diamond, the score was 4
to 2. Last Saturday it was 6 to 5.
Today, if the process of evolution
continues, Stanford should draw a
tie or win.
In practice today the Cards re
ceived somewhat of a setback when
Ray Forsythe, shortstop, turned his
ankle. He has been hitting quite
consistently during the past month.
His two-bagger over the fence in the
U.S.C. game was the first time a col
lege player has knocked the ball out
of the Sunken Diamond. His posi
tion will be filled by Frank Tre
maine.
Johnny Campbell will start on the
mound for the Cards and will be
used clear through the game if
everything fares well. Campbell has
been improving during the season
and should be able to hold the Beai's
under control. In reserve, Wolter
will have Fred Heringer, the iron
man of his pitching forces.
