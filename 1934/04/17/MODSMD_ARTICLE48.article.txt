California football teams, holds an old-size football to show the diffi
culty in gripping the lacing for passing. Irvine Warburton (right), All.
America quarterback from the same school, demonstrates the "thinner"
pigskin which will be used next spring. He can get his fingers around
the lacing which means a better grip for throwing, players say. The
ball's nearly an inch thinner. (Associated Press Photo)
