# Almack Tells Demand for Tenure Laws
## Must Eliminate Politics, Says Educator 
### 
Tenure laws are necessary as a
guarantee both to the public and to
Ihe teacher, according to Dr. John
Conrad Almack, professor of Educa
tion at the University, but present
regulations must be amended to al
low for separation of the appointing
authority and the removing author
ity of the school system.
Discusses Tenure
These views, among others, were
expressed by Dr. Almack as he dis
cussed teacher tenure, battleground
for many an educational argument,
during the Stanford University Hour
last night. This hour, Stanford's con
tribution to the adult education pro
gram, sponsored by the National
Broadcasting Company, is a regular
feature of station KPO and is pre
sented every Monday evening al
7:45 o'clock.
Dr. Almack contended that poli
tics plays too great a part in the
length of a teacher's service and
that both the hiring and firing of
teachers should be taken com
pletely out of the hands of politi
cians and persons who use a promise
of teaching jobs to further their own
ambitions. The teacher who feels
that she has been removed or trans
ferred unfairly should have the right
to bring her case before a specialized
professional body that cannot be
reached by political influences, he
said.
Security Gained
The public would be benefited by
giving the teacher this added se
curity in her position, explained Dr.
Almack, because frequent changes
allow only about 50 per cent of the
teachers to reach their maximum ef
ficiency, due principally to the fact
that it takes from two to five years
for a teacher to reach her maximum
efficiency in a school. In connection
with this matter, Dr. Almack said
that less than 5 per cent of the teach
ers in small schools have taught five
years in the same system.
"The merit system should be the
sole judge of a teacher's right to her
position," concluded Dr. Almack,
"and every public officer who has a
just idea of his duty to the people
testifies to the value of this reform,
while its staunchest friends are
among those who understand it
best."
