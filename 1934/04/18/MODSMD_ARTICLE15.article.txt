# '35 Carnival Entries Due
## Many Already Training For Aquatic Funfest 
### 
Two more days remain before
Farm residents will flock to Encina
pools, to watch the Masque Ball
King and Queen officially open the
class of 1935's edition of the annual
Junior Water Carnival.
Friday afternoon's aquatic fun
fest, thought preliminary to the eve
ning's "dance of the year," is not
secondary either in tradition or in
trinsic interest.
Although gratified by the large
number of students who have sig
nified their intention of entering
Carnival events, committee chair
man Jim Triolo pointed out that
there is room for many more. Entry
blanks are again printed in this
morning's Daily, and the final entry
lists will be made up from blanks
received by 8 o'clock tonight.
Blanks may be turned in to com
mittee members appointed by Ben
Cave, Waddy White or Helen Ray,
or to the A.S.S.U. office in the Old
Union.
Most of the events in the Carnival
are unrestricted, entry blanks being
required only for those events
printed on them.
Previous intramural classifications
will apply at the Junior Water Car
nival; thus it will be impossible for
unattached swimmers to band to
gether at the last minute, and form
a team. In the "nightshirt relay,"
teams must furnish their own night
shirt—one shirt to a team.
All men who intend to come to
the Carnival, even as passive spec
tators, are asked to come in swim
ming suits. A special event has been
planned for all men to enter.

begins at 2 o'clock in Encina pools,
