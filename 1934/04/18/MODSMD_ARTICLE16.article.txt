# Japan Plans Ban on China Help by U.S.
## Nippon Will Accept Peace Responsibility in East 
### 
TOKYO, April 17 (/P).—A mani
festo setting forth Japan's responsi
bility to maintain peace in East
Asia and objecting to the efforts of
other nations, including the United
States, to help Chinese air and mili
tary forces was studied today by
Foreign Minister Koki Hirota.
A draft of the document, called a
"restatement and clarification of the
Japanese policy toward China and
designed to outline Chinese relations
with other powers so as not to
jeopardize peace, was sent to the
Foreign Office for approval.
Subsequently it will be communi
cated to the Japanese Minister in
Nanking and Japanese Ambassadors
in Washington and other capitals to
serve as a basis for explanations. ,
The draft was shown to an Asso
ciated Press representative by a
high official who declared that "his- :
tory shows that technical or finan
cial aid to China almost inevitably
becomes military or political, in
which event Japan must object."
He declined to answer a question j
as to how this would affect the sales
of American airplane manufactur
ers to China, Washington's cotton I
and wheat loan to China or the ac
tivities of Americans in helping es
tablish Chinese air routes and !
training Chinese aviators.
The document says:
"We regard Japan principally re
sponsible for the maintenance of
peace in East Asia and we are de
termined to fulfill this mission; in
order to do so, Japan must share
CTiina's responsibility for the main
tenance of peace.
"Japan sincerely desires the in
tegrity, unification and restoration
in China. History teaches that it is
only achievable through China's,
own endeavors.
"Japan, therefore, must break
China's anti-Japanese movement
and eliminate China's traditional
policy of setting one power against
another.
"In the situation which has arisen ]
since the Manchuria and Shanghai
incidents, if other powers attempt
to co-operate in assistance to China, 1
whether under the guise of financial
or technical assistance, ultimately
such efforts almost inevitably pro
duce political results.
"The outcome for China may be
calamitous, endangering her integ
rity and producing a division of
spheres of influence.
"Japan does not object to other
powers individually negotiating
with China for assistance in the
fields of economics and commerce,
provided such do not disturb peace
and maintenance of order in East'
Asia.
"But if such efforts lead to a dis
turbance of the peace . . . Japan
must object." . ,

"Japan does not object to other
powers individually negotiating
with China for assistance in the

TOKYO, April 17 (/P).—A mani
festo setting forth Japan's responsi
bility to maintain peace in East
Asia and objecting to the efforts of
other nations, including the United
States, to help Chinese air and mili
tary forces was studied today by
Foreign Minister Koki Hirota.
A draft of the document, called a
"restatement and clarification of the
Japanese policy toward China and
designed to outline Chinese relations
with other powers so as not to
jeopardize peace, was sent to the
Foreign Office for approval.
Subsequently it will be communi
cated to the Japanese Minister in
Nanking and Japanese Ambassadors
in Washington and other capitals to
serve as a basis for explanations. ,
The draft was shown to an Asso
ciated Press representative by a
high official who declared that "his- :
tory shows that technical or finan
cial aid to China almost inevitably
becomes military or political, in
which event Japan must object."
He declined to answer a question j
as to how this would affect the sales
of American airplane manufactur
ers to China, Washington's cotton I
and wheat loan to China or the ac
tivities of Americans in helping es
tablish Chinese air routes and !
training Chinese aviators.
The document says:
"We regard Japan principally re
sponsible for the maintenance of
peace in East Asia and we are de
termined to fulfill this mission; in
order to do so, Japan must share
CTiina's responsibility for the main
tenance of peace.
"Japan sincerely desires the in
tegrity, unification and restoration
in China. History teaches that it is
only achievable through China's,
own endeavors.
"Japan, therefore, must break
China's anti-Japanese movement
and eliminate China's traditional
policy of setting one power against
another.
"In the situation which has arisen ]
since the Manchuria and Shanghai
incidents, if other powers attempt
to co-operate in assistance to China, 1
whether under the guise of financial
or technical assistance, ultimately
such efforts almost inevitably pro
duce political results.
