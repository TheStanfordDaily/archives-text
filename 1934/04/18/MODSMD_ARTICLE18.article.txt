# Group Confers About Sorority System Change
## Committee Completes Long Investigation; Submits Finished Revision Women Will Take Secret Ballot on Report 
### 
The A.W.S. Commission, which
has been meeting since February 11
to discuss the pros and cons of the
Stanford sorority system, is repre
sentative of all the organized groups
of women on the campus, and in
this way has succeeded in obtaining
all the important points of view
necessary for a well-rounded con
sideration of the question.
The 34 members include Women's
Council, president of Roble Club,
president of Union Club, president
and vice-president of Pan-Hellenic,
president of Y.W.C.A., president of
W.A.A., head and assistant head
sponsor, chairman of the vocational
guidance committee, chairman of the
health and scholarship committee,
all class committees, and delegates
from other living groups that were
not v/ell represented.
The work of the commission has
been to compile a list of the advan
tages and disadvantages of sororities,
which has been accomplished
through various sub - committees.
The final report, which will be pub
lished in the Daily at an early date,
is in the form of a balance sheet of
assets and liabilities. This can be
balanced only after personal evalua
tion of the items and every woman
on the campus should consider it her
duty to read the report thoughtfully
and should form her opinion in the
light that she is partly responsible
for the kind of social institutions
which the present A.W.S. hands
down to future Stanford freshmen,
states Jeanne Millard, A.W.S. presi
dent.
To gain a free expression of in
dividual beliefs the commission will
take a vote from all the women by
secret bailov. The ballots will prob
ably require the checking of one of
the following statements: (1) sorori
ties should continue as they are;
(2) the rushing system should be
reorganized; (3) sororities should be
abolished.
Statistics on the matter of which
groups are mainly for or against so
rorities will be possible by having
separate ballot boxes for the row
and for the hall, and different col
ored ballots to distinguish each class.
A meeting of the commission has
been called for 5 o'clock today. The
xeports of the sub-committees are to
be passed or rejected by the whole
group.
