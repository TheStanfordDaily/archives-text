# Devices for Predicting Earthquakes Described
## 
### RUSSELL PAINE 
It happened in 1906.
I Exactly 28 years ago this morning,
at 5:13 o'clock to be exact, one of
the greatest earthquake catastrophes
j of civilized times took its toll of life
I and property on the Stanford cam
pus.
While buildings were toppling,
fires raging, injured persons still
lying in the streets, and confusion
reigning everywhere, scientists, seis
mologists, and earthquake authori
ties were busily at work making
I such crude recordings of the earth's
! movements as they could.
However, "most of the advance of
study of earthquakes, especially in
this country," declares Sidney Dean
Townley, professor emeritus of as
-1 tronomy and geodesy, "has been
made since 1906."
! Townley, a leading authority on
; earthquakes who has been at Stan
ford since 1907, further explained
that the chief advance in the field
; prior to the "San Francisco Quake"
[ was made in Japan. John Milne, an
< Englishman associated with the Uni
versity of Tokio, accomplished a
I really remarkable study there," he
I said.
In recent years much work has
{ been done to help predict the com
ing of quakes. Devices have been

| invented which foretell earth tilt
ing* which, it is believed, come prior
S to the shakes themselves.
The only genuine Japanese in
; strument for predicting in America
'is located at Stanford, Professor
j Townley stated. A number of simi
i lar delicate instruments made in the
| United States are located in various
i sections of the country, one being |
; installed in the basement of the
| Physics Building at Stanford, an- |
other close to the Hayward fault at
] the University of California.
"Whether they will be able to do j
' much toward predicting from this j
tilting, I don't know, Townley said.
The San Andreas fault, which runs !
I back of the campus and which is the
one on which the 1906 disturbance
occurred, is hundreds of miles long
i and extends into Mexico.
( The most recent experimental
i work about earthquakes, says Town
ley, was made by the U.S. Coast i
Survey Installing Plan, which put
i into operation "strong-motion seis
, olographs' about two years ago, to
try to get more accurate knowledge
of movements during quakes.
One of these, he said, was in op- I
oration in Southern California dur- !
ing the Long Beach earthquake of
j last year.
