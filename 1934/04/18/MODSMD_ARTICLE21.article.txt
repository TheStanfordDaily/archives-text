ing out difficulties which defeated:

His official statement was:
"While I regret that we are to be :
delayed in completing the reorgani
zation of the student body, the fact
that students were of a mind served
its purpose.
"I hope that they will respond as
readily to our requests for informa
tion in remedying existing evils as
they did in displaying their opin
ions at the polls.
"Most everybody admits that, as a
whole, the constitution which was
defeated is a better piece of work 1
than the one under which we are
functioning. But that isn't enough,
evidently. As a result, we will try to
iron out the difficulties and will
again submit the constitution to a
student body vote in the near fu
ture."
