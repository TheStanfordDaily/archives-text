# Committee Quits After 7-2 Defeat
## Trautman Gets Formal Resignation Letter 
### 
Following the acceptance of yes
terday's election returns by the Ex
Committee last night, the resignation
of the Constitutional Revision Com
mittee was tendered and accepted.
The letter follows:
"Mr. Gerald Hough Trautman,
President of the Associated Students,
Stanford University, California.
Dear Prexy:
"We have been informed that there
is some silght dissatisfaction with the
proposed Constitution in that it was
defeated by a six to one Quad vote.
This has caused us deep regret, over
whelming sorrow, profound remorse,
great shame, not to mention acute
embarrassment, due humility, and
annoying self-consciousness.
"Wherefore, we do hereby respect
fully submit and tender all of our
right, title, and interest to and from,
by and with that august body, the
Constitutional Revision Committee,
or at least so referred to in the com
mittee meetings among the commit
tee members only.
"In this, our first venture in con
stitutional fatherhood, we feel that
our success has not been conspicu
ously and overwhelming successful,
and bowing to the mandate of the
masses as expressed on the Austra
lian ballot on the Stanford campus in
the County of Santa Clara, State of
California, we do here, now and
forever, forfeit the rare privilege
and rarer honor of conceiving con
stitutional gems for constitutional
elections. In short, government of
the people, by the people, and for
the people in the land of the free and
the home of the brave.
"Briefly, we resign.
Paternally yours,
Albert L. Denney
Abe I. Mellinkoff
Crompton Bangs, Jr."
