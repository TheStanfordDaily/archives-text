### Frank Orr 
Sharply, decisively, by a vote of
680 to 177 the proposed A.S.S.U. con
stitution was defeated yesterday.
"1 lie whisper of an organized op
position yesterday morning grew
into a roar by 2 o'clock when the
polls were closed, and the business
of vote counting by the election
board became monotonous as an
overwhelming total piled up against
the new system of government.
A two-thirds vote would have
been required for adoption.
Committee Resigns
As the vote against their ideas be
came larger the Constitution Revi
sion Committee in true Cabinet fash
ion resigned. Lacking even a definite
vote of confidence, committee mem
bers said they did not feel qualified
to proceed with drafting a new doc
ument.
Work on the now-useless system
had been progressing since fall quar
ter, when the committee was ap
pointed by A.S.S.U. President Jerry
Trautman in conformity with the
existing constitution. The present
rule provides for revision this year.
The procedure to follow will be
the appointment of a new commit
tee to start work immediately on a
new set of laws, with the new regu
lations to be submitted to another
special election when they are com
pleted. checked by lawyers, and
passed for a vote by the Ex Com
mittee.
