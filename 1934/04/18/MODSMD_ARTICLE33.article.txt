The dcfoal of the proposed new A.S.S.I'. (Constitution
in yesterday's election lias done much to prove one thing:
You can lead a student to the polls, hut you can't cast
his vote.
As a result, the constitution is slill a hope. Hackers of
the move to give student politics some better surroundings
and a good move it is should he greatly heartened
rather than discouraged by the results yesterday. For
where was thought to exist almost complete apathy on
the campus there was found to be some aggressive inter
est. From that suddenly aroused feeling will arise ideas,
suggestions which should go far toward giving Stanford a
really practical and flexible instrument with which to
govern its affairs, it is not too late to make the needed
corrections and win an endorsement even more over
whelming than was the negative vole.
President Jerry Trautman, who has worked unceas
ingly for the best interests of the campus, will see that
lliis document—the high spot of a successful term —is
moulded into the form best suited for all concerned. That
has been his aim from the start. It will be his conclusion.
There was but one sorrv side to the story of the defeat,
a situation in which The Daily admits its share of the
guilt: Opponents took too long to react, to realize that
there were some things which needed attention. Offsetting
that charge, however, was the fact that an insufficient
amount of time was allowed for public hearing on the
completed constitution.
True, it was discussed, in some of its more important
phases, by the constitutional committee and groups af
fected by the phases. Hut there should have been one more
step the public hearing. Gatherings of that sort probably
will not draw tremendous crowds, but they will serve to
get the proper heads together for mutual and campus
benefit.
Moreover, airing of problems in this Forum will force
the objectors to get their troubles off their chests and
insure the solid endorsement of this needed improvement.
