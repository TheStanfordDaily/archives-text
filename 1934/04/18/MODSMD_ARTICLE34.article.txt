# A 						Lobby and a Glass of Milk
## 
### 
The rnion Board of Governors meets tonjght. Two
important and vital matters must be passed upon at that
meeting. The first, of particular interest to the women of
I' 11 ion Club, regards Ihe opening of the rnion lobby to
Ihe women of I nion dormitory.
Individual members of the Board of Governors have
announced their willingness to allow the women to use the
lobby.
The Daily commends Ihe intelligent spirit of the mem
bers of Ihe Board. Because of their just attitude, the
women of l'nion Club probably will have a suitable lobby
after tonight.
A few points remain to be clarified, however. It has
been objected that clubs and organizations holding dinners
at the t'nron Dining Boom need some place to meet that
they will be deprived of a meeting place.
This is not at all the case. When the lobby is opened to
Ihe women, there is no reason why it cannot still be a
gathering place for such meetings as il has been in the
past. The women have no objections to il, and their presi
dent has even gone so far as to suggest that way out of
the difficulty.
II is said that Boughs will be deprived of a place to sit
and rest or read newspapers. Observation reveals thai
fc*w of them ever use the I'nion lobby. What is more, the
Cellar is quite adequate. The probability is that more men
will use Ihe lobby if il is opened lo women than Ihcv ever
did before.

The second matter, interesting to everyone who eats in
the I'nion, concerns the price of a half pint of milk. Yes
terday's Daily cited the essential facts of the situation a
wholesale cost of two and a half cents and a fountain price
of seven cents. Two hundred per cent from Ihe ice-box
lo Ihe glass in front of you!
Here again individual members of the Board have
shown their progressive altitude. Herb Sanderson wants
to know why Slanfordites are soaked seven cents for a
half pi 111 of milk at llieir own fountain, when they can g'o
down to any Paly creamery and gel a pint for Ihe same
price.

The Daily feels confident that, in view of the altitudes
individual members of Ihe Board have expressed, both of
these matters will be satisfactorily settled. The I'nion
women, the Daily believes, will have a lobby, and the
campus will have a nickel glass of milk.
