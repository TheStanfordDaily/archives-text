# BULL SESSION
## THE 						FINNS PAID UP 
### 
Walter Damrosch is a fine fellow.
His hair is gray and he weilds a
mean baton. He is remembered as
the man who is bringing music to
the unmusical school children of the
nation. Symphony series A, B, C,
and D, respectively, are indeed in
structive. More instructive are the
little gems of explanation which ac
company the conductor's musical
gems.
An enthusiastic listener to Series
B (for children in the grammar
school grades), we were unduly im
pressed by Damrosch's mellifluous
introduction of a Finnish symphony.
He told us that we should all appre
ciate this melody, particularly, since
of all the nations of the world, Fin
land was the only one which was
making full payments on her war
debts to the United States. Bile
reigned.
That little Hearstian remark dis
credits Mr. Damrosch as a true mu
sician. If dollars forced the propa
gandic statement, that is lamentable.
If the eminent conductor actually
believes financial considerations
should determine artistic apprecia
tion, that is somewhat amusing. We
fail to believe that if France had not
defaulted, Maurice Chevalier would
be any more or less of a pansy.
Whatever the cause of Damrosch's
remark feeble, his advice is indica
tive of the nature of much modern
thought. In a day when the scien
tific method is on the lips of every
"educator," and in the hair of every
"student," the meaning of the con
cept emanates in many cases from
no deeper part of the brain than the
jawbone, and penetrates no deeper
into the brain than the dandruff.
So grammar school children, when
being urged to start a school savings
account, are told that the banker is
good, because he is successful. They
are made to believe that the "Star
Spangled Banner" is the most beau
tiful of all possible anthems, because
it is the American anthem. And
congx-essmen refuse (at least tem
porarily) to erect a statue to the
statesman Robert Ingersoll, because
the thinker Robert Ingersoll was an
agnostic or an athiest.
Such is objective thinking in pop
ular practice. The scientific method
is all right for test tubes and Para
mecium; but it is pure rationaliza
tion in secular life.

being urged to start a school savings
account, are told that the banker is
good, because he is successful. They
are made to believe that the "Star
Spangled Banner" is the most beau
tiful of all possible anthems, because
it is the American anthem. And
congx-essmen refuse (at least tem
porarily) to erect a statue to the
statesman Robert Ingersoll, because
the thinker Robert Ingersoll was an
agnostic or an athiest.
Such is objective thinking in pop
ular practice. The scientific method
is all right for test tubes and Para
mecium; but it is pure rationaliza
tion in secular life.

Walter Damrosch is a fine fellow.
His hair is gray and he weilds a
mean baton. He is remembered as
the man who is bringing music to
the unmusical school children of the
nation. Symphony series A, B, C,
and D, respectively, are indeed in
structive. More instructive are the
little gems of explanation which ac
company the conductor's musical
gems.
An enthusiastic listener to Series
B (for children in the grammar
school grades), we were unduly im
pressed by Damrosch's mellifluous
introduction of a Finnish symphony.
He told us that we should all appre
ciate this melody, particularly, since
of all the nations of the world, Fin
land was the only one which was
making full payments on her war
debts to the United States. Bile
reigned.
That little Hearstian remark dis
credits Mr. Damrosch as a true mu
sician. If dollars forced the propa
gandic statement, that is lamentable.
If the eminent conductor actually
believes financial considerations
should determine artistic apprecia
tion, that is somewhat amusing. We
fail to believe that if France had not
defaulted, Maurice Chevalier would
be any more or less of a pansy.
Whatever the cause of Damrosch's
remark feeble, his advice is indica
tive of the nature of much modern
thought. In a day when the scien
tific method is on the lips of every
"educator," and in the hair of every
"student," the meaning of the con
cept emanates in many cases from
no deeper part of the brain than the
jawbone, and penetrates no deeper
into the brain than the dandruff.
So grammar school children, when
being urged to start a school savings
account, are told that the banker is
good, because he is successful. They
are made to believe that the "Star
Spangled Banner" is the most beau
tiful of all possible anthems, because
it is the American anthem. And
congx-essmen refuse (at least tem
porarily) to erect a statue to the
statesman Robert Ingersoll, because
the thinker Robert Ingersoll was an
agnostic or an athiest.
Such is objective thinking in pop
ular practice. The scientific method
is all right for test tubes and Para
mecium; but it is pure rationaliza
tion in secular life.
