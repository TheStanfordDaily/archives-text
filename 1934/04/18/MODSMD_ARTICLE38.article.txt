### 

An overnight trip into the stratosphere will be undertaken this
summer by Dr. and Mrs. Jean Piccard of Wilmington, Del. They expect
to use the same balloon in which Lieut. Comm. T. G. W. Settle and
Major Chester Fordney made their trip last summer. Mrs. Piccard will
occupy the gondola's pilot seat. Piccard is the twin brother of AugustÂ®
Piccard, pioneer stratospherist. (Associated Press Photo)
