ESKIMO ,
At Blanco's Theatre
This is, to the best of my knowl- 1
edge, the first outstanding example |
of American cinematic art. I do not |
mean that it is the first good picture
to be made in America. But most
American movies are very obviously
adapted stage plays, using stage
technique and depending upon dia
logue and artificial setting. But a
picture like this is distinctly a mo
tion picture, and the pictorial range
of the camera is made to contribute
enormously to the total effect.
I can best illustrate by two Rus
sian pictures recently shown here v
"Storm Over Asia" and "Thunder
Over Mexico." One could imagine
neither of these as a stage play; story
and dialogue were almost absent,
and were not the chief point of de
pendence. The background, the very
composition of each photograph, j

fiuenced the tone of the whole. The
characters were not merely placed
against a background, but back
ground and characters explained
each other.
Director Van Dyke has used a
similar technique in "Eskimo." He
made a definite impression and in
does emphasize pictorial artistry to
the same degree, and consequently
misses some of the heights the Rus
sians obtained; at the same time, he
gains the advantage of not making
his technique so apparent—one fault
Eisenstein especially cannot avoid.
It is a simple story, yet not de
void of variety and occasional rapid
action. In following the adventures
of one Eskimo, Mala, who seems to
epitomize the whole race, and at the
same time to stand out as an in
dividual, the various sides of Eskimo
life are shown. The picture becomes
an epic in the true sense of that

much-abused word.
j Van Dyke used native Eskimos
I and apparently allowed them to act
: as they thought best. The result is
! highly gratifying: there is no single
! action which is not natural, sincere,
i and effective. And although the Es
' kimo modes of conveying emotion
j naturally differ considerably from
| our own, every mood was perfectly
conveyed. The extreme reality of the
whole picture is an amazing achieve
ment.
And even though it attempts to
furnish a chronicle of various phases
; of Eskimo life, the story always re
; mains as an artistic unit; every epi
| sode contributes to the aesthetic af-
I feet. And, contrary to the impression
; to be gained from advertisements,
the picture does not lean toward the
adventurous or sensational.
Hollywood would have a perfect
right to advertise this as a great pic
| lure, were it not for the fact that
superlatives have been scattered too
! freely, leaving a masterpiece like
i this to go begging.
