# WHY IT'S NEWS
## A 						New Jap Attitude, or Old Stuff? 
### CROMPTON BANGS Jr 
Yesterday in Japan the Associated j
i Press got hold of a piece of news
; which may or may not be a scoop.
The gist of it is that Japan's foreign
1 policy toward China is about to be
restated, and that protests will be
; made to the U.S. about our sales of
! airplanes and loans of pilots to ttie
| several Chinese armies.
The information came not from
; official news sources, hut from a
spokesman; the incipient protest is
i still in draft form; and the Japanese
are cautious and correct diplomats,
i If this goes through, it leoks like a |
slip on their part.
Is it News?
[ In the proposed protest, Japan in- j
j sists that she has the responsibility
! of keeping peace in East Asia, and j
| to make sure China's foreign con- j
| tacts will not break this peace. There |
| are two things to consider here: (1)
iis this news? (2) what does it j
: mean?
If Japan has a Monroe Doctrine in j
I East Asia and is watching over her,
: special interests there, she has bor
rowed all this from the U.S. Besides,'
Japan's superior position and special i
interests have long been tacitly rec
ognizedâ€”even by Uncle Sam. So
this statement is hardly news,
j Now nobody doubts but what the
Nanking and Canton governments in

China have been arming to the teeth.
There is no doubt that the U.S. has
sold them several million dollars
worth of military planes, throwing
in flying instruction in the deal.
America's Captain Frank Hawks is
demonstrating bombers in China
right now.
What Does it Mean?
All these planes and many more
war supplies have been paid for
with borrowed money. The U.S.
Government even sold China our
annoying surplus cotton and wheat
on a long-time, but rather dubious
credit basis. What makes Japan mad
is this. She has over half a billion
dollars in investments in default in
China. It irritates the Japanese to
see all this money spent on war ma
terials while China is paying them
exactly nothing on many of their
investments.
Here again we can't talk. Remem
ber the violent protests of our Con
gressmen when France spent billions
on armaments and not one cent on
war debt payments to us? Japan is
in the same boat; only she is vastly
stronger than China.
Is it Important?
Apparently, what seems to be a
brewing tempest, will soon blow
over. It may have been put out as a
feeler to sound out American opin
ion. The chances are that no formal
protest will be made to the U.S., but
by the device of the spokesman the
state of affairs will have been called
to our attention. A year from now,

the seemingly important news story
will look insignificant, but it will
have served its purpose.
