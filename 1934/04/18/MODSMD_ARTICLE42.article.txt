which the versions by Goethe, Gou
nod, and Marlowe are most famous.
Local interest is attached to the
announcement of James Sandoe's
connection with the presentation in
the dual capacity of actor-director.

included roles in "An Enemy of the
People," "Berkeley Square," "Ro
meo and Juliet," "Bird in Hand," and
many readings presented by Sword
and Sandals, of which he is presi
dent. He v/ill appear in the title role
of Faustus.
Nor is this Sandoe's first directo
rial venture into the field of the
"classics," for last fall he directed
with signal success a Palo Alto pro
duction of Sheridan's "The Critics."
