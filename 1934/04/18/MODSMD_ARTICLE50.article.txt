# WELLER TELLS OF COLLECTING BOOKS IN TUESDAY TALK
## 
### 
Revealing his love oi books and
! speaking with enthusiasm, Earle Vo
nard Weller, well-known book col
lector and author, last night dis
cussed "The Pleasures of Book
Collecting" before a good-sized
Tuesday evening Assembly Hall au
dience.
Speaking under the auspices of the
Peninsula Arts Association, which
organization is now sponsoiing Fine
Book Week on the campus, Weller
injected his subject with humor and
human interest.
He quoted such items from book
catalogues as the auction of 500 let
ters of Elizabeth Barrett Browning,
a letter of Benjamin Franklin writ
ten in 1788, and the only first edition
copy of the book "Black Beauty,"
stating that these listings and iheir
descriptions make some of the most
interesting reading in the world.
Graduating from generalizations to
his own personal collection, Weller ;
described his many volumes of j
Keats and told of how he first be- !
came interested in collecting the
works of this author.
"I trace my interest in Keats to j
the discovery of a small volume of !
criticism by Mrs. F. M. Owen in a
second-hand bookstore in Los An
geles," he stated, then went on to
say that, obtaining the volume for !
$2.50, he learned several years later
that the book was very valuable.
Weller brought with him from San
Francisco three of his most valuable
volumes, a 1665 first edition copy of
Milton's "Paradise Lost," a first edi
tion of Rousseau's "Social Contract,"
and an 1820 first edition of Keats'
poems.

MADRID, April 17 (JP). â€” The
government stepped sternly into the
Valencia labor crisis to declare a
"state of alarm," similar to martial i
law, but not as drastic.
