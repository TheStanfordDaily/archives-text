# LITTLE BIG MEET SET FOR FRIDAY
## Frosh Last-Minute Injuries Upset Predictions; Chances Balanced as Contest Nears 
### WARREN BREED 
Willi the dope bucket as evenly balanced as a set of scales, prospects
for the tightest Little Big Meet in years loom, with the meet set for Ed
wards Field, Berkeley, at 2 o'clock Friday afternoon.
Until last Saturday, the local Papooses were .iust about a cinch to annex
the meet in a I)reeze. But fate decreed a miserable lot for Bill Ellington

and his men, and pulled a muscle on
the leg of Chuck Voigt, who was
down on Ellington's slate for a cinch
10 points and a lap on the winning
relay team. Voigt was to have
copped the 440 and broad jump, but
he has a hard time lifting his leg now.
A big boost in frosh hope is the
work of Jack Carlson in the javelin,
who Monday tossed the spread 177
feet, which is just about as far as
any Cal babe can swing it. Ray
Williamson, a 180-foot man when
iri shape, may forget about his sore
arm long enough to sneak in for a
point or two for Stanford.
Although dopesters are willing
to concede the widely-heralded
George Anderson, "unbeatable"
Cal frosh sprinter (see Brick
Morse), a pair of first places in
the sprints, two papoose speedsters
are a good bet to finish two-three
right behind him. Alex Faye and
Fred Williams are the papooses,
both are pretty runners, and don't
wait for anybody when they get
started.
Doubtful indeed is the set-up in
the 880. At the beginning of the
year, Stanford would have been eas
ily conceded first and second places,
with Bob Alexander and Bill Mc-
Curdy able to run away from any
and all Bear yearlings. However, a
certain Cal man, Heavy by name,
has shown considerable improve
ment, and the last ten or fifteen
yards may see all three lurching for
the tape, stride for stride.
The mile is virtually in the bag
for Rusty March, although the U.C.
hope, Voorhees, has run close to
4:30. The blinding speed of the trim
Indian flash is too much for any
other freshman on the coast. In the
two-mile, Max Schiferl and Warren
Breed will race against a hard-gal
loping Bear cub, Lyons, the cub at
present having a faster time to his
credit than either Stanford man.
Gridmen in Relay
The relay will pit Alexander, Mc-
Curdy, March, and Green against
the Cal quartet of a sprinter and
three football players. Coach El
lington is loud in the praises of this
team, and insists that if the meet
depends on the relay, nothing short
of a broken leg can stop his babes
from capturing the bacon.
Two of the prettiest races of the
day will be the hurdles. Cal frosh
coach A1 Ragan, no mean barrier
man in his own day, has a couple
of the best prep hurdlers to come
out of central California. Gregory
Stout broke a couple of North Coast
records while going to Berkeley
High, while his teammate, Henry
Waddell, starred at Tamalpais, along
with Sam Klopstock. This twain will
give Ernie Evans of the Indian
forces plenty of competition.
Kingsbury Runs
Sout shines in the highs, and
Waddell in the lwos, so Ernie will
need to run both at top speed.
Evans has better time in the highs,
and just as good time in the lows
as the Cal pair, and can cop both.
Ralph Kingsbury will also run, and
may be able to sneak in for a point
or two.
Stanford strength is in the
weights, but an appalling weakness
attends the three leaping eventsâ€”
broad jump, high jump, and pole
vault. Jim Reynolds, George Berg
man, and Chuck Ledbetter are a
lead-pipe cinch to sweep the shot,
and in the discus Jack Walton,
Doug Spenser, John Hurley and the
shotputters are safe bets except for
Glenn Randell, the big Cal man who
has a mark of 150 feet, but is now in
only fair condition.
