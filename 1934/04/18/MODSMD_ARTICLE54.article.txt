Chuck Nimmo's quick recupera
tive powers have given him an iron 1
man stunt to perform during the Big |
Meet next Saturday which should
prove one of the features of a thril
ling afternoon. In the opening track
event the Caid soph will face Bob
Raftery, Cal's plucky miler who
amazed fans several weeks ago by
running 4:24.7 to win over Benavi
dez of U.S.C.
Outside of the fact that Raftery is
good enough to press any miler on !
the Coast are two other conditions
which should result in the U.C. en
trant's forcing Nimmo to run his I
fastest. The first is that Saturday
will mark Raftery's third and last
big meet, a "do or die" elTort, and
the Raftery grit is familiar to all
who have faced him. The second is j
the burst of speed with which Raf
tery comes down the home stretch.
Whether Nimmo can match that last
rush to the tape is giving the dope
sters plenty of worry.
I MAY BREAK UP CAL
! SWEEP OF HALF-MILE
In the half Nimmo will tangle with
i a quartet of runners who may lower
the world's four-man two-mile relay
mark later in the season. First is
Bob Reynolds, who had such a suc
i cessful season with the 880 last year 1
that he was elected captain of the
Bear forces for the 1934 season. Then
ian upstart of a sophomore, Dick
Brace, proceeded to pass the Cal
leader in the final 100 yards and
! claim the first place. Finally U.C. |
found itself with a half-miler to beat
both Brace and Reynolds in Hickcr
! son, a J.C. transfer. The fourth man
is Moore, himself capable of better
than 1:59 Saturday.
With Reynolds going out at the i
gun to set a fast pace, with Hicker-. 1
: son a strong second lap, and with
Brace kicking through with a driv
ing finish it's hard to see just where
Chuck comes in, despite his 1:56.9
j mark of last Saturday. Nimmo is |
still untried in the dual role, how
ever, and may surprise the Cal
! backers, including Brick Morse, of
i a Bay sporting green, who wants to
i give Cal the first four places in the
| half. j
MORE DOPE ON
i BULLET 808 KIESEL
About a week ago under the title
of "What Makes a Champion," this
column attempted to offer a few
facts on why Bob Kiesel is one of
the two fastest men in the country
today and why the 0:09.(i 100-yard
dash record for the Big Meet may be
claimed by the U.C. boy this Satur
day. After going through several
slashings because of a shortage of
space the story came out with a list
of Kiesel marks and nothing on
j "What Makes a Champion." Here's
another try to present some per
haps inconclusive but none-the-less
eloquent evidence on "What Makes
a Champion."
Bob Kiesel has behind him not
only a dad who could out-run every
i kid in the school yard but also a
j mother who enjoyed a similar dis
! tinction. At least that's what Mr.
! Kiesel Sr. claims. But Stanford fans
will be most interested in the fact
i that the California sprint champ is
related on "his mother's side to none

other than the Farm's greatest mid- '
! die-distance ace, Ben Eastman.
COMEBACK SEASON
FOR BOTH
Further coincidence is that both
Bob Kiesel and Ben Eastman suf
fered pulled leg muscles within the
last two years and that both arc
| making their comebacks this spring.
Ben's was last Saturday, and the
sight of the Card favorite coming out
of the tunnel with his matchless
stride seemed like old times to the
Farm fans. It was a real trial for
Ben. Eastman was not only giving
his injured leg a real test in match -
i ing strides with Chuck Nimmo but
was also running his first 880 in
three years. Ben's troubles reached 1
i their peak when he mistook the !
timer's call for 53 for 63, time for
j the first 440. But his 1:52.4 with lit- |
tie training makes the track future,
; Europe or Japan perhaps this year I
i and the Berlin Olympics in '36, look
bright once again for Benjamin
i Bangs Eastman. â€”D'Evelvn
