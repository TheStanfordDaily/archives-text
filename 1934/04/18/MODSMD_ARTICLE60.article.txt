# WATER POLOISTS START PRACTICE
## Five Regulars Return As Squad Organizes

With Stanford's varsity swimming
season over, with the exception of
two senior P.A. events in May, Coach
Nort Thornton's water polo players
re-captured possession of Encina
pools this week to begin spring prac
tice.
Captain Gordy Graves and Paul
de Silva are the only 1934 regulars
who will be lost to next year's team
through graduation.
Lettermen who have looked good
so far in practice include Captain
elect Leo Cook, Bob Foster, Jim
Benet, Vlad Taranik, and Bill Wood
ard. Jimmy Triolo, who was out
most of last season with poison oak,
is still on the invalid list.
Among the freshmen who will bid
for places on the junior varsity and

varsity next fall are Bob Hoover,
Ben Voss, Alec McKenzie, Don Pe
terson, Pat Pearson, Bob Haslacher,
Jack Scharlin, Martin Scatena, and
Bob Harris.
