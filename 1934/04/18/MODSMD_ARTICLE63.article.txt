# Captain Meier in Hospital As Cindermen Taper Off
## CHUCK NIMMO SLATED TO RUN IN TWO EVENTS 
### Jack Drown 
Although Captain Gus Meier, star
Card hurdler, was confined to the
Stanford Hospital yesterday noon
with a cold, that fact did not dis
courage Coach Dink Templeton's
track and field stars from going
through their paces last evening un
der the watchful eyes of their youth
ful coach.
With the Big Meet with California
but three days away, Meier's con
dition caused plenty of discussion
and talk on the part of the track
fans who gather every afternoon to
observe the Indian stars in their
workouts.
Illness Not Serious
However, it is believed that Gus's
illness is not at all serious and that
possibly he will be discharged from
ihe hospital this morning.
Dink Templeton has definitely de
cided to run Chuck Nimmo, slender
sophomore mile sensation, in the
mile and half-mile. Last night, run
ning at a terrific pace and with no
competition, he clicked off three laps
or 1,320 yards in the marvelous time
of 3:08.3, setting a new Stanford
record for the distance. Ben East
man held the former mark of 3:09.
Raftery Is Threat
Nimmo will have to pull an iron
man stunt Saturday to place in the
880, because to start the afternoon's
activities, Chuck and Red Raftery,
the California star, meet in their
great mile duel which is apt to re
sult in a new Big Meet record for
the distance. Both performers have
run better than 4:25, Nimmo having
the best mark of 4:22.9.
In the 880, Chuck, after a grueling
mile, will face a great Bear half-mile
trio composed of Dick Brace, Cap
tain Reynolds, and Kitchell. All of
these men have run 1:57 or better
and "little" Nimmo will have his
work cut out for him if he breaks
into this group for points.
Templeton has decided on his mile
relay team and it is believed to be
his best combination. Dear, Burris,
Dellinger, and Elackman make up
the quartet, it being the same one
which defeated the Olympic Club
aggregation last Saturday in the
stadium.
Thorns Favors Leg
Carlton Thorns, the Card hope in
the sprints against California's Bul
let Bob Kissel, showed up on the
track yesterday with a sore leg,
which he twisted in the Olympic
Club contest. However, with the
proper care, he should have the bum
pin in shape for California.
In the meantime, Stanford's sure
point winners, Johnny Lyman, great
weightman; Bud Deacon, line pole
â€¢vaulter; A1 Blackman, quarter-miler
deluxe; Sam Klopstock, soph timber
topper sensation; John Mottram,
javelin thrower without a peer on
the Coast, all continue to work hard
so as to be in the best possible shape
for the Bears on Saturday.
