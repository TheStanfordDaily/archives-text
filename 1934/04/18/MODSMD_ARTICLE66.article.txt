# CARDS OUTPLAY U.C. NINE; LOSE VARSITY GAME
## 
### 
Once again Stanford varsity ball
nine outplayed California's baseball
forces, this time to the tune of 13
hits to the Bears' five, and again the,
Indians came out on the short end
of the scoring column, this time, the
fourth, by a 5-3 count.
Four California pitchers were sent
to the showers, the bases were loaded
with but one out in the ninth, and
still the Cards couldn't pull the game
out of the fire. In the last inning,
with one out Hamilton and Miles
got hits. Galbraith scored Hamil
ton, and was safe at first on an error.
Trautman went to first on four
balls, filling the bases. Beach, bat
| ting for Tremaine, struck out. Dodge,
who went in for Massey behind the
plate when the latter sprained his
ankle in the third inning, hit hard
down the first-base line. Riddel,
Cal's first sacker, made a wild stab
at the ball, made good on a shoe
string catch, and tagged out Dodge
for the final out.
Johnny Campbell opened in the
1 pitchers' box for the Cards, and for
three innings no California batter
reached first base. In the fourth two
walks, an error, and three Cal hits
' gave three runs, and what turned
out to be the ball game. Fred Her
: inger went in for Campbell, retired
I the side, and pitched the remainder
of the game, allowing California but
two hits.
Stanford's runs, besides the one
| scored in the ninth, came in the sixth
inning on hits by Tremaine, Massey,
and Campbell. Tremajne and Mas
sey scored on sacrifices by Grayson
i and Nutting. Hamilton led the Card
batters with four hits in five trips
to the plate.
