Primo Camera, the heavyweight champion, stopped off at Boston
enroute to the Maine woods where he plans five weeks of Intensive
training for his fight with Max Baer. An accommodating Nova Scotia
guide, Clarence Mason (right), gave him a few pointers on shotguns
in case he does some hunting. (Associated Press Photo)
