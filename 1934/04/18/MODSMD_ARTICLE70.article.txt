# BUSINESS FIVE CAPTURES TITLE
## Robb Stars as Alpha Delts Lose in Mural Game 
### 
Business School's clever passing
j and accurate shooting riddled the
| Alpha Delt defense and won the all -
i University intramural basketball
| championship last night, 31 to 20.
Alpha Delt's high-scoring star, ;
Parmer Fuller, seldom broke through
j the well-synchronized and hard
; checking financial wizards, but still
managed to swish the twine with
! three field goals and a foul throw :
to lead his cohorts.
The dead-eye of the affray was
; Jack Robb, grad, the spark of a
well-oiled attack, which func
tioned particularly well close to
the basket on short passes that
j caught the Greeks napping.
Alpha Delts captured nearly every |
i tipofT, and almost made up in speed
j what they lacked in experience.
■ Ralph Mac-Michaels played center
for the Row team, outjumping Frank
I Stewart in the second half. Johnny
1 Mack also stood out in the second
! haif, sinking three long field goals
I that cut down the gracLs' lead to
j three points.
However, the half-time lead of 13
j to 5, coupled with a scoring spree by
| Stewart in the last five mirfutes, put
the game on ice for Business School
before the final whistle.
