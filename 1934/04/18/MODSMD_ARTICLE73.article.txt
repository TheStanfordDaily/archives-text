# INDIAN NETMEN POINT FOR U.C.
## 
### 
With Captain Chuck Otis, Stan
ford's .number one netman, now
playing consistently excellent tennis,
Stanford hopes for a win over the j
California varsity this Saturday are j
rising.
Evidence that Stanford may cop ■
the first doubles match was shown |
yesterday afternoon, when Otis and ]
Johnny Law, ranked third, defeated
Sherman Lockwood, Card tennis i
coach, and frosh captain Bill Sew- ;
aid.
Furthermore, by a method of rea
soning common to football fans in
predicting results, the first singles ,
may also fall to Stanford. Otis, in
last Saturday's U.C.L.A. match, de
feated Jack Tidball, who in turn
holds to his credit a victory over
Gene Smith, number one man and 1
captain of the California varsity.
Consequently, there is a fair expec
tancy of Otis defeating Smith.
On the other hand. Stanford must
meet their Berkeley rivals minus
Sam Lee, number two man, whose
injuries incurred in the fatal San
Francisco automobile accident Fri
day night will keep him from play
ing. Law will move up to the place
thus left vacated by Lee.
Ted Lilienthal may also be out of
competition Saturday. As a result
of a bad foot, he went to a San
Francisco hospital yesterday, and if
he is not able to play Saturday, Ray
Jadarola may compete against the
Bears.
