# COACH ANNOUNCES LINE-UPS FOR U.C. GOLF TOURNAMENT
## 
### M. JACK NEWMAN 
Substituting Charles De√ürettville
for the injured Ed Beuter, Coach
Eddie Twiggs announced the start
ing lineups of the freshman and
varsity golf teams in the annual
matches with California, to be
played at Orinda country club next
Friday.
The varsity line-up has Don Ed
wards as the lead-off man, and
Dick Giddings as the number two
man. Jack Hoerner, Tom Dwyer
and Morse Erskine have the next
three berths on the team. Bob
Thompson, Hugh Mellon and Dan
Moser are the next. Following them
on the squad is minor sports cham
pion Gene Brown who is just win
ning his way back toward the head
of the ladder. He won his position
from Bill Hoclle, who follows him.
Little "Stcn" Sheppherd and De
Brcttville complete the team.
The freshman team will be lead
by Mac Stoddard. Dalton Henderson
will play the number two position
and Howard Clark the third. Bob
Welsh won the fourth position in a'
recent match with George Barkey,
who is in the next position. The
last three on the freshman team to
go to Orinda are George Hurst, King
Erown, and John Crable.
The matches consist of six indi
vidual matches on each team in the
morning and best ball matches in
the afternoon. Last year Stanford
overwhelmed California by a large
margin. The frosh lost only a half
point to the invaders. Team men
will probably play excellently on
the Orinda links, since they are do
ing well on Stanford though handi
capped by poor greens.
