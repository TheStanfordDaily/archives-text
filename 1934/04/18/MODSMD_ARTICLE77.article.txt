# FROSH NETNEN DOPED TO WIN OVER CAL CUBS
## 
### 
Facing some really tough compe
tition in the California frosh Friday
afternoon on the varsity courts,
Stanford's yearling tennis players
are busy polishing up their strokes
this week.
This match against their prime
rivals from Berkeley will be the last
of the season for the Papoose net
men, and they have no intentions of
dropping it.
If everything happens as doped,
the Indian frosh should conqucr the '
Bear Cubs. However, the Califor
nians are no cinch and are conceded
a good chance of an upset. Their
two stars, Paul Newton and Dick
Bennett, are both capable of de- j
feating Ben Dey and Bill Seward i
of the Cards, with those players at
anything below their best tennis.
As their other men are just about
on a par with Forbes, Helmholz,
Easton, and Dibblee of Stanford, j
Indian supporters are counting on
Dey and Seward to come through in
both the singles and the doubles.
The lowest four of the six singles
berths will be filled by the four men
named above in that order, bat
Helmholz and Easton will play sec
ond doubles, with the third team in
this division composed of Dibblee 1
and Taylor. Seward will challenge
Dey for the honor to face Newton
of the Bear frosh in the first singles !
Friday, with the loser to meet Ben
nett in another important match.

i Because of our re-established re
lations with Russia, George Wash-
I ington University has added courses
in Russian language, literature, and
history to its curriculum.
