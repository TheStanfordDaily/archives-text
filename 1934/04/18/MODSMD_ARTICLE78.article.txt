# PROSPECTIVE GRID STARS SCRIMMAGE FRIDAY AFTERNOON
## 
### 
American football fans will get
their first chance to see the Stan
ford team in action Friday after
noon, when Coach Tiny Thornhill
will send his prospective 1934 var
sity through a scrimmage, in which
most of next season's stars will
compete and in which some of the
new Thornhill plays will be publicly
aired.
The scrimmage is planned to be a
part of the big Friday alumni home
coining day. The play will probably
be somewhat belated, as the Water
Carnival will be progressing during !
the earlier stages of the afternoon, j
A warm-up scrimmage was held
inlormally last Friday, with no |
eventful results. Frank Alustiza,
running at full for the varsity,
looked good.
Newest change in the grid ma
chine is the transfer of Ben Pala
mountain, tackle, for the past two
years, to end. The tackle posts,'
with Callaway, Reynolds, Dunn, and
Lettunich, besides several big frosh,
are well taken care of, so the change
will strengthen the end situation, J
with only Lyle Smith and Keith \
Topping at present with any varsity !
experience.
