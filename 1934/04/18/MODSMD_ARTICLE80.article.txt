# S.C. Requests Change In Far Western Meet
## 
### 
Because of objections brought in
by the University of Southern Cali
fornia, the Far Western track and
field committee at its meeting Thurs
day decided to hold its annual meet
June 9 instead of June 1 as orig
inally planned. To concentrate on
this affair, to be held at Berkeley,
the Pacific Association meet, slated
for the Stanford stadium May 19, is
called off and will be combined with
the Far Western.
U.S.C.'s objections were based on
the fact that the National Intercol
legiate meet is to be run off in Los
Angeles June 22 and 23 and it was
felt that a meet of the calibre of the
Far Western a week before would
detract from the interest in the
southern affair.

NEW YORK. April 17 (/!').â€”Pres
ident Rooscvelts "New Deal" regime
was denounced as "reactionary and
un-American" by his distant cousin,
Colonel Theodore Roosevelt.
