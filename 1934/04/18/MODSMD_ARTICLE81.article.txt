# Facilities of Theatre Are Not Modern
## Study Made of Equipment On Other Campi 
### 
Stanford's deficiencies in the way
of dramatic equipment are accented
by a resume of the elaborate the
atres, expensive assembly halls, and
numerous classrooms dotting the
campuses of other educational in
stitutions.
Probably the most outstanding ex
ample is Dartmouth. With an en
rollment of 500 students, it boasts a
large, up-to-date dramatic depart
ment, complete with auditorium.
Princeton's "Intime" theatre can
only remotely be compared to the
local structure's drafts, poor visi
bility, and bad acoustics. One of
the finest edifices of its kind in the
country, Princeton's "Intime" is al
most unsurpassed.
Carnegie Tech, besides an ade
quate auditorium, has extensive
courses in drama, well-supported
by the student body.
Yale's assembly hall, architec
turally and acoustically approaching
perfection, was established by a
Harkness bequest, but has since,
been self-supporting.
U.C.L.A. and its recently-con
structed gathering place, lowa,
Drake, Illinois, countless other sur
passed by the local institution in
innumerable v/ays, have dramatic
equipment vastly superior to that
possessed by the Farm.
The University of Washington is
the one major exception. Washing
ton's dramatic department struggles
under the same handicap as does
the local division, its assembly hall
being as inadequate and out-moded
as Stanford's.
Probably because of the limited
facilities, the average audience at a
Washington play or concert is about [
2UU persons. The hall was originally '
designed to seat 2000. Glenn Hughes,
director, is capable, experienced, and
puts out praiseworthy opuses,
which draw audiences too small to
justify production, purely because
of lack of accommodations.
Stanford is rapidly reaching the I
same predicament. Its hall has a
capacity of approximately 1750, but j
draws an average crowd of 800, ex
cept for an unusually well-attended
event once or twice a year, when j
even the poorest seats are filled. j
Washington, however, is superior
to the Farm, in that it possesses one
of the best dramatic libraries in the
country.
Old plays are valuable, and an
extensive collection is no doubt
praiseworthy and helpful, but the
immediate need is far more urgentâ€”
a new campus theatre.
