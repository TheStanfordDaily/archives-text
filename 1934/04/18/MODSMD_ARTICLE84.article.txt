## 
### 
Climaxing continued inconveni
ence from lack of a lobby in which
to receive and entertain guests,
Union women will present their
problem to the Union Board of
Governors at its noon meeting to
day.
Their request will be permission
to use the main Union lobby now
closed off from the doi'mitory by
doors at the end of the waiting
room now in use. The proposition
will include the building of a par
tition to cut off entrance to the
cafeteria from the room connecting
the present reception room with the
main lobby.
Action Expected
Favorable action by the Union
Board of Governors is anticipated
from the following statements made
by Board members and interested
parties.
Les Hables, Union Board Mem-!
bcr: "I am quite in favor of the!
Union women being given the use
of the main lobby. I see no reason
why it should not be."
Herb Sanderson, Union Board
Member: "The small lobby which
the Union lobby has now is ridi
culous."
Jerry Trautman, Union Board
Member: "I see no reason why the
women should not be given use of j
the lobby."
Miss Price, Director of the Union
unit: "Union residence is handi
capped by lack of adjacent social
rooms. With a small structural
change it would be possible to shut
off access to the cafeteria and make
it possible to open up the doors be
tween the main lobby and the small
Union waiting room."
Union President
Jane Hillebrand, President of the

Union unit: "Undeniably the Union i
club needs a lobby. The lack of an
adequate place to receive and en- '
tertain guests is strongly felt. Use '
of the main Union lobby towards!
this end would be a great advantage |
for the Union Club and yet would ;
not appropriate the more general
usage of the lobby."
Abe Mellinkoff: "I am sure the
Board will consider all proposals
with interest."
Professor William Owens: "I will
look over the situation today."
Dean Culver: "I will be very glad '
to listen to the presentation of the |
problem."
Comptroller Almon E. Roth was
not on the campus yesterday and 1
could not be reached for a state- 1

Les Hables, Union Board Mem-!
bcr: "I am quite in favor of the!
Union women being given the use
of the main lobby. I see no reason
why it should not be."
Herb Sanderson, Union Board
Member: "The small lobby which
the Union lobby has now is ridi
culous."
Jerry Trautman, Union Board
Member: "I see no reason why the
women should not be given use of j
the lobby."
Miss Price, Director of the Union
unit: "Union residence is handi
capped by lack of adjacent social
rooms. With a small structural
change it would be possible to shut
off access to the cafeteria and make
it possible to open up the doors be
tween the main lobby and the small
Union waiting room."
Union President
Jane Hillebrand, President of the

Union unit: "Undeniably the Union i
club needs a lobby. The lack of an
adequate place to receive and en- '
tertain guests is strongly felt. Use '
of the main Union lobby towards!
this end would be a great advantage |
for the Union Club and yet would ;
not appropriate the more general
usage of the lobby."
Abe Mellinkoff: "I am sure the
Board will consider all proposals
with interest."
Professor William Owens: "I will
look over the situation today."
Dean Culver: "I will be very glad '
to listen to the presentation of the |
problem."
Comptroller Almon E. Roth was
