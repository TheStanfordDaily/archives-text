# Fancy Ink on Photygraf Album Drying
## 
### 
Jimmy Algar explained with a
twinkle in his eye that the next
Chappie will have such fancy ink
on its cover that it won't be dry
until Friday morning, when The
Old Photygraf Album will make its
appearance, instead of Thursday, as
before announced.
According to the Old Man himself,
it will be well worth waiting for
the intimate revelation of how
Quad photographs are really made.
Every and each reader had better
be sure and look to see if he has
met with sarcastic treatment at the
hands of Chappie's heartless car
toonists, especially if he has been
lax in following out the sacred tra
ditions of the Farm.
All salesgirls are requested to
meet Hal O'Dell on the Engineering
corner at eight o'clock Friday morn
ing. The Old Boy promises that
they will not have any trouble in
taking in the dimes and nickels for
this, the funniest Chappie in the
history of the magazine.

WASHINGTON, Aprli 17 (/P). â€”
Senator King (Dem., Utah) said he
would reintroduce his bill for im
mediate Philippine independence if
a canvass shows a majority of Sen
ators favor the move.
