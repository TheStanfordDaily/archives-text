# Helvenston's Spring Play In Rehearsal
## 
### 
With May 11 set as date for pro
duction, work progresses on Ger
trude Tonkonogy's "Three Cor
nered Moon." This rollicking com
edy is essentially a commentary on
life in a slightly insane household,
vaguely resembling "Another Lan
guage."
The plot, briefly, concerns Mrs.
Rimplegar, a Russian peasant who
has fallen heir to a sum of money.
Her mad manipulations and scatter
brained speculation cause turbulent
careers for the entire family, with
hectic results.
Characters arc finely drawn. Three
brothers, one played by James
Bcnet, have wide possibilities. Ken
neth Rimplegar is an exponent of
that genus of person who spends
half of his life at the telephone. His
elder has a penchant for a newly
acquircd Harvard accent.
The play and its extraordinary
characters rant and romp, both
mentally and physically, throughout
all their chaotic careers.
Kay Arthur shews up well in re
hearsals as a well-meaning but stu
pid mpid. Shelley Smith, who de
lighted the audience with her bit in
"Distant Drums," is said to resemble
Ruth Gordon of the original cast in
her interpretation of the ingenue
role.
