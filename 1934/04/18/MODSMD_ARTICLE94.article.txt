# Dr. Reinhardt Plans Series of Talks on Art
## German Professor to Give Extension Course 
### 
German Professor Kurt Reinhardt,
who has been so active in infusing
art into other departments of the
School of Letters at Stanford, was
recently requested by the Univer
sity of California to give a series of
15 lectures in autumn semester at
the extension division on Powell
Street in San Francisco. The dis
cussions, on "Philosophy of Art,"
will be illustrated by the use of
lantern slides.
San Rafael's Dominican College,
which places great emphasis on the
fine arts, has also persuaded Dr.
Reinhardt to deliver several talks on
"History of European Art." The
first was given Tuesday; more will
be given throughout the month.
Chosen from the School of Letters
with Professor Hazel Hansen and
Henry Lanz to compose a commit
tee of three, Professor Reinhardt
has been working to integrate art
into the general Stanford curricu
lum. Until the ultimate goal of a
School of Fine Arts is realized, pro
fessors of various departments will
co-operate in instructing in art.
The summer quarter program will
include excursions to art galleries of
San Francisco, including the De-
Young museum and the Legion of
Honor. An exceptional exhibition
will be attended in June: Master
pieces of French Painting during
five centuries.
