# LATEST SPRING EDITION OF BAWLOUT HAS BUTCHER, BAKER, NO CANDLESTICKMAKER
## 
### 
The mighty clan of the Scintillat
ing Smiths once more leads all oth
ers in numbers in the current Bawl
Out, which is on sale today, with
31 members, from Bromley to Wil
liam W., bearing the honorable
name.
The Browns, as experts prophe
sied, come second with 25, while
the Clarks (unless three wayward
Clarkes be counted) lie with the
Anderson family with 17 apiece.
The usually strong Joneses trail in
ninth or tenth place with but nine
name-bearers.
Between Lewis Aaron and Walter
Zweig, who hold first and last po
sitions, respectively, in the Bawl
Out. one finds a wonderful assort
ment of names. For instance, we
have a Lesser, a Cypher, and a
Null, although, sadly enough, no
unsuspecting Void registered. Like
wise, we find a Butcher and a
Baker, but no Candlestickmaker.
Palamountain is one of the larg
est names in the directory, and is
possessed by one of the largest men
on the campus.
Running through the Bawl Out,
one crosses Miles and Miles and
Miles (five in all). In the F's, Fast
and Farr are to be found side by
side. There are several Hunters and
Fishers to take care of the nu

merous Fishes, Ravens, Hares,
Foxes, and other members of the
animal kingdom. Four Graves and
two Coflins lend a cheerful aspect
to the much-loved Bawl Out.
Poor little X is the only letter of
the alphabet with which no Stanford
student sees fit to start his name.
