### 
A Student Hospitality Committee,
named by Jerry Trautman and com
posed of representatives of all liv
ing and eating groups, met last night
to make definite plans for the wel
come of more than one thousand
alumni who will return to the cam-*
pus this week-end.
All men students and faculty were
invited to meet the grads at the large
stag dinner being held tomorrow
night at 6:15 in the Encina Commons.
Reservations are available at the
alumni office.
Coach to Speak
Those who cannot get to the din
ner were also invited to come to the
Encina lobby immediately after
wards, where a track rally will be
held, with a talk by Dink Temple
ton, and numbers by the band and
Glee Club on the program.
Aylett Cotton and George Fuller
were appointed head of the commit
tees to care for the transportation
and reception of the grads, and the
entire group was given instructions
and suggestions for making the three
day program successful in every
way.
Will Meet Trains
Plans were made tQ meet the re
turning alumni at trains on Friday
and Saturday, particularly the Sun
set Limited and the Lark coming
from Los Angeles.
Almon E. Roth, vice-chairman of
the Homecoming Committee, was in
charge of the meeting, and reminded
students that they should not miss
this opportunity to make the ac
quaintance of returning alumni as
well as to help make their stay en
joyable.
Ask Co-operation
"Stanford has always been known
for its friendly atmosphere," he re
minded, "and returning graduates
will expect to find it just as much
so today as it was when they were
here. Show them that they are right,
and make them feel at home in every
way possible."
Aylett Cotton asked that evex-y
-one give him as much help as pos
sible in caring for the transporta
tion of the grads tround the campus.
"The committee is doing everything
possible by meeting trains and being
on hand around the Qaad," he
stated. Any help given by others
who can use their cars in this capa
city will be appreciated."
Windshield stickers for those who
plan to use their cars for driving
alumni are available at the Regis
trar's office, and should be called for
today.
