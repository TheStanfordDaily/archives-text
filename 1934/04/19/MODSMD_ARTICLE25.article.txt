# English Head Talks to 50
## Majors Hear Hardin Craig On Language, Letters 
### 
Professor Hardin Craig, head of
the School of Letters, last night pre
sented one of the most enlightening
of a series of major department lec
tures yet given to a group of 50
persons in the Little Theatre.
Beginning by explaining that his
statements would probably be in
fluenced by his interest in the field
of creation and letters, Craig kept
his audience amused and alert as
he vigorously commented on the
functions of the English department
and the affiliated subject of public
speaking.
Language, Thought, One
"The modern theory of English,"
Craig said, "is that language and
thought are as one. When one learns
to speak and write well he learns
to think in an orderly manner. Thus
language is a mental state and is
the medium of judgments and con
cepts where imagery and volition
disappear."
In speaking of English as a ma
jor, Craig said that one should go
into the field only if his impulses
tell him he is well fitted for it, but
that a working knowledge of pub
lic speaking, grammar, and writing
was obviously essential in any vo
cation that one might enter.
Criticism Important
Besides the function of service,
Craig believes that the field of
criticism is an important one open
ing out from English study. As his
idea of critics Craig cited Walter
Lippmann and Chester Rowell.
Craig said that the department
couldn't make poets and writers out
of its students, but it might recog
nize and encourage what artistic
ability the students may have.
Spelling Lauded
"A man might be a saint on
earth but if he can't spell and use
capital letters he is always con
demned," Craig humorously stated.
"And a high-pressure salesman who
comes to you and talks to you like
a wind out of a threshing machine
has no culture and is neither a
good salesman nor a gentleman."
In closing Professor Craig ex
plained the requirements of the de
partment for a degree, the fields into
which English majors go, and the
unusually good adaptibility of in
dependent study to the study of
English.

Sand bars are being formed which
it is believed will connect the Aleu
tian Islands with the Alaskan main
land.
