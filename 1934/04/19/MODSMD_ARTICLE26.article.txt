# Water Fun Provided in Meet Friday
## Rival Factions Gird For Hard-Fought Fray 
### 
Two hours of splashing fun are
promised all those who attend to
morrow afternoon's Junior Water
Carnival at Encina pools. Fraterni
ties, sororities, and clubs, rested
after their strenuous political battle
of yesterday, will go through final
practices today for this annual aqua
tic show.
Hoping for a week-end cleanup,
Theta leaders hurled defiance at
their champion next door neighbors,
Alpha Phi Chi Omega, another
strong contender, hinted that they,
too, might make a strong bid for the
carnival title. It is hoped that all
regular intramural organizations
will enter the carnival.
Entries have been extended an
other day, Committee Chairman Jim
Triolo announced. They may be
turned into the A.S.S.U. office as
late as noon today. Entry blanks
were printed in Tuesday's Daily,
and appear this morning as well.
In addition to one tentative event
which may be. open to any men,
spectators as well as regular com
petitors, there will be several other
comic events. Among these are Pro
fessor Flopuel Q. Zilch and His Man
Thursday, Classic of the Century,
Balloon Race, Egg and Spoon Race,
"Riding the Dolphin" Relay, and
Nightshirt Relay.
