# Student Aid Work Begins
## 
### 
According to Mrs. Spenner, who
is in charge of student employment,
work has already begun on all CWA
projects. Those that had not started
Monday or Tuesday began work yes
terday, when Mrs. Spenner gave out
the last release card.
Work was carried on last month in
practically every department. Nearly
all projects that departments started
last quarter with the first $4,770
check received from the State Emer
gency Relief Administration, are be
ing continued this month with the
second grant for the same amount.
However, some of the projects were
completed, and new ones have been
started.
In most cases students are work
ing in their major departments,
benefiting themselves intellectually
as well as financially- Those who
were employed in March but failed
to report at the employment office
wex*e dropped from the lists.
