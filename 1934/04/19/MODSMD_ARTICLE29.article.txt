# Dr. Savelle Discusses Work On History of Paris Treaty
## 
### 
Research in history, like in most
of the other sciences, is daily grow
ing more complex. More materials
are constantly coming to light, and
Historical standards are ever de
manding for satisfaction a higher
criteria of excellence and technique.
Such was the opinion expressed by
Dr. Maxwell Savelle of the Stan
ford History ( Department when he
explained the necessary labor in
volved in writing the book upon I
which he is now engaged relative to
a history of the Paris Treaty of Peace
of 1763.
"In writing this book," stated Dr.
Savelle, "it means that every known
source in the world bearing upon
the .subject must be carefully read
and assimilated." The book will re
quire two of three years to finish,
and necessitate trips not only to

many of the greater libraries in
North America, but those in Lon
don. Paris, Madrid, and Simancas
as well. This summer Dr. Savc'lc
plans to travel and visit as many of
these centers as possible.
By means of the powerful new
Leitz - Wetzlar electro - stereopticon
projector of Stanford Library, the
professor has made extensive notes
from negatives of rare documents in
the "dark-room" of the Library.
Dr. Savelle recently published a
book entitled: "George Morgan: Col
ony Builder," a work of some 225
pages, requiring travel throughout
North America and Europe for ma
terials. More than 10,000 notes were
taken and compilation required
nearly five years.
When the forthcoming volume of
Dr. Savelle is published it will be
his second book.
