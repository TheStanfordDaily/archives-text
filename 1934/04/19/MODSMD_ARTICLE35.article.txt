### 
Members of llie student body who opposed and de
frilled the constitution which was submitted to them Tues
day have put themselves on the spot.
President Jerry Trautman realized that when he said
in yesterday's Daily, "I hope that they will respond as
readily to our requests for assistance, in remedying the
existing evils as they did in displaying their opinions at
I he polls."
The Daily, for one, stands ready to assist to the fullest
extent in,the satisfying of cycrvone's requests and the cry
ing need for an improved form of government. It hopes
that those who had the courage to speak against the con
stitution's flaws will display the same courage when they
are called on for assistance.
