# A 						Board Acts Quickly and Fairly
## 
### 
They met, they considered, they acted wisely and well.
Yesterday the Union Board of Governors did two things
• made two decisions whicli make for the immediate and
ultimate good of Stanford.
They met for lunch in the dining room and in a pro
gressive and intelligent spirit considered the adjustment
of the price of a glass of milk in the Cellar.
They found that seven cents was too high for Stan
l'ordites to pay for a half-pint of milk, and in line with
other progressive eating houses, the price should be live.
They acted wisely and decisively—now the price is five.
At that, the Union faces a bit of loss by reason of the
new price. Labor and overhead expenses added to the
two and a half cents wholesale cost bring the actual cost
lo five and four-tenths cents.
The four-tenths of a cent is well spent, and not lost, so
the Hoard of Governors feel. Good will toward the Cellar
will undoubtedly be built up by a move which portrays
both a generous and enlightened attitude on the part of
those who oversee the Cellar and the policies which gov
ern it.
Previously, a glass of milk ruined a dime. All that was
left was a penny or two, good only for King Contests and
Jimmy. Now a whole nickel remains. Perhaps we'll have
another glass of milk or maybe two doughnuts. Doughnuts
or toast are both good with milk when you stop by the
Cellar on the way home from the Libe.
Turning the conversation from milk to lobbies, the
board considered another strained and entirely unsatis
factory situation.
The women of I'nion dormitory, with a reception hall
smaller than the average family living room serving in
lieu of a lobby for over two quarters, will now have the
use of the I'nion lobby.
The Board of Governors clarified a stand long since
forgotten. In their minutes from last spring was a reso
lution to the effect that the new women coming into I'nion
dormitory should be allowed the use of the lobby.
This Ihev reiterated, re-stated perhaps a bit more cor
dially. In addition they discussed the question of opening
the doors in the connecting hall, and of closing off the
cafeteria with folding doors.
Provision will soon be made for those doors so that
the hallway may be permanently opened. Plans for a new
lobby, sometime in the future, extending out on the park
ing area, were advanced.
Women of the I'nion now have a lobby— true, not to
the exclusion of the men; but at anv rale the improvement
is marked. The situation is much improved, and the
women are thankful. *
The Daily must once again commend the Union Board
of Governors. Both issues, fair and clean-cut, were de
cided in a like manner. To the board, flowers and thanks.

of the price of a glass of milk in the Cellar.
They found that seven cents was too high for Stan
l'ordites to pay for a half-pint of milk, and in line with
other progressive eating houses, the price should be live.
They acted wisely and decisively—now the price is five.
At that, the Union faces a bit of loss by reason of the
new price. Labor and overhead expenses added to the
two and a half cents wholesale cost bring the actual cost
lo five and four-tenths cents.
The four-tenths of a cent is well spent, and not lost, so
the Hoard of Governors feel. Good will toward the Cellar
will undoubtedly be built up by a move which portrays
both a generous and enlightened attitude on the part of
those who oversee the Cellar and the policies which gov
ern it.
Previously, a glass of milk ruined a dime. All that was
left was a penny or two, good only for King Contests and
Jimmy. Now a whole nickel remains. Perhaps we'll have
another glass of milk or maybe two doughnuts. Doughnuts
or toast are both good with milk when you stop by the
Cellar on the way home from the Libe.
Turning the conversation from milk to lobbies, the
board considered another strained and entirely unsatis
factory situation.
The women of I'nion dormitory, with a reception hall
smaller than the average family living room serving in
lieu of a lobby for over two quarters, will now have the
use of the I'nion lobby.
The Board of Governors clarified a stand long since
forgotten. In their minutes from last spring was a reso
lution to the effect that the new women coming into I'nion
dormitory should be allowed the use of the lobby.
This Ihev reiterated, re-stated perhaps a bit more cor
dially. In addition they discussed the question of opening
the doors in the connecting hall, and of closing off the
cafeteria with folding doors.
Provision will soon be made for those doors so that
the hallway may be permanently opened. Plans for a new
lobby, sometime in the future, extending out on the park
ing area, were advanced.
Women of the I'nion now have a lobby— true, not to
the exclusion of the men; but at anv rale the improvement
is marked. The situation is much improved, and the
women are thankful. *
The Daily must once again commend the Union Board
of Governors. Both issues, fair and clean-cut, were de
cided in a like manner. To the board, flowers and thanks.
They met, they considered, they acted wisely and well.
Yesterday the Union Board of Governors did two things
• made two decisions whicli make for the immediate and
ultimate good of Stanford.
They met for lunch in the dining room and in a pro
gressive and intelligent spirit considered the adjustment
of the price of a glass of milk in the Cellar.
