# Turn Out! It's Worth It

### 
Tomorrow afternoon, tin: Masque Hall's predecessor
hill no less ils equal comes to I lie Farm for its annual
afternoon of aquatic hilarity.
The Junior Water Carnival, with as much variety in
I lie numerous events as I hose of a Sunday school picnic,
reigns supreme over the fun of the Farm.
When night falls, ils glory will fade inlo the records of
I lie past and the fast rising light of the Court of Mephis
lopheles.
But while it lasls, il will provide one of the most inter
esting afternoons spring quarter can offer. Expert swim
ming will vie with expert showmanship. Anyone who re
sents being called a grind or a recluse cannot, afford to let
the Water Carnival go hy unseen.
