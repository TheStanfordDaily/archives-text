## Silver—Inside Out 
### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
While the President was on his
J vacation definite leadership was
' sadly lacking. Congress, already
' restless, let go in earnest. When
| F.R. got hack, the Senate presented
! him with a hot potato—the new sil
| ver inflation bill.
| Briefly, this bill would allow al
! most unlimited coinage of silver.
! Economists differ as to the probable
j effects. Just now the interesting
! thing is what is behind the hill?
Background
I Last time the silver issue turned
up in the Senate, it lost by just two
votes. This hill is very cleverly
drawn up, and should pass easily.
Let's see why.
j The bill is designed to draw sup
' port from farmers by undertaking to
get rid ol' large surpluses of their
\ products. It has a bait for the textile
j interests because it promises to ding
! British and Jap competition from
their low-wage mills in the Orient.
This will happen because the prioe
of silver is upped. Naturally, the
inflationists and the silver mining
states will take to the bill like fish
, to water.
On the Spot
If passed, F.R. will have (o veto
the hill. Now whatever position he
takes, the President is sure to he
damned by one element or another.
Republicans are wearing broad
smiles. A veto would hand them
important and powerful ammuni
tion.
The farmer could see that the New
Deal had deserted him. It would be
tasy to show him that there is a
whale of a difference between mar
keting his surpluses for cash (in sil
ver) instead of plowing crops under
and restricting acreage.
It will take all of Mr. Roos«velt's
persuasive qualities to prevent pas
sage of the silver hill. Most obser
vers feel that even F.R.'s great pres
i tige cannot stem the tide in the face
of the oncoming elections.
The Shady Side
It is the President's realization of
the seriousness of his position that
has prompted him to find another
way out. Everybody knows that
bank vaults are bulging with hoarded
silver—waiting for a further rise in
price. Few people know who owns
this silver. Within the past few
days, F.R. has had good reasons to
suspect some of it belongs to the
Senators who are pulling wires to
get the silver bill passed—to hand
themselves a tidy profit.
So the Government's No. 1 dirt
finder, Ferdinand Pecora, has been
sent to New York to run down these
rumors. If there is anything to theni,
President Roosevelt will have a first

class issue to bring to the people
over the radio. They can then de
cide between Congress and the Pres
ident. At any rate, the existence of
a form of graft, long suspected by
some people, should he investigated.

Due to intensive farming, Japan
has less area under cultivation today
than in 1920, but obtains larger har
vests.
