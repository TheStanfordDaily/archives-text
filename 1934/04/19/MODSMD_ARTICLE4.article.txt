# Price Cut on Cellars Milk
## Board Declares Lobby Open For Use of Women 
### 
The price of Cellar milk will be
five instead of seven cents a half
pint, and the Union lobby will be
open to women. This was the deci
sion of the Union Board of Gover
nors yesterday afternoon.
The new price of milk will mean
four-tenths of a cent loss on every
half pint of milk for the Cellar. To
explain this, Miss Christine Ricker
issued a report of the expenses which
raised the original price of two and
one-half cents for a half pint. Fol
lowing is a list of these expenses giv
ing the percentage of selling cost:
Cellar percentages based on 1933-
1934 figures:
Dining
Cellar Room
Labor .310 .27
Other expenses
breakage, etc.) 051 .035
General expenses 081 .108
Milk at Seven Cents
Cost now 025
Labor 021
Other expenses 003
General expenses 005
Total 054
Thus there was a 23 per cent profit
per half pint of milk when it sold
for seven cents. However, it was
added that if the wholesale price of
milk should go up, the Cellar could
not stand the additional loss, and
might have to return it to the orig
inal price.
It was the opinion of the Union
Board members that it has always
been the women's privilege to use
the Union lobby. This privilege is
included on the minutes of the Union
Board of Governoi's. This does not
mean that the lobby is for the exclu
sive use of women.
At present there is only a round
about way by which the lobby may
be reached by the Union women.
However, it is hoped that this in
convenience may be eliminated in
the near future. Furthermore, plans
have been suggested for an extension
into a portion of the present parking
place to build a new lobby for the
women alone.
