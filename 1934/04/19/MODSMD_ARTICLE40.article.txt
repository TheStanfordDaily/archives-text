# BULL SESSION
## MAKE CRIME PAY 
### 
Six destitutes, nobles, or morcns
! offered their lives to Dr. Cornish of
Berkeley as human subjects for the
scientist's startling life-death expe
riments. All offers have been sum
marily rejected.
Regardless of the merits of the
particular case, human lives are
sadly needed for scientific research.
; Corpses are helpful, but not nearly
! so responsive as the living flesh,
j Some of the greatest advances in
! science have been made with vivi
-1 section pcrfurmed on dogs, cats, and
; miscellaneous "dumb" animals. Hu
man counterparts of these animals
must be provided.
We have always regretted the hor
| rible waste of human life entailed
! in state gallows, electric chairs, and
assorted death chambers. A tight
ened rope, a few thousand watts, or
j a shot of lethal gas—and the state i.s
j satisfied. But for science—a whole
, clinic of varicose veins, twitching
villi, and distorted nerves have been
lost forever. If men must be killed
for crime, why not make crime pay
like it has never paid before. The
noose satisfies nothing except the
spirit of vengeance. The scalpel
means progress.
Bespectacled spinsters have car
ried on a great moral crusade against
the butchery of tabby cats in the
name of science. To an open
mouthed and sadistic public they
have painted a ghastly picture of
; innocent, mouse-catching kittens

writhing in agony under the knife of
the man-in-white. Such, of course,
is not the case. Badly vivisectioned
patients are not aware of the fact
that they are being vivisectioned, nor
are they permitted to wake up and
suffer. Such should be the proce
dure with criminals sentenced to die.

Sentimentalists have nothing but
horror as a reaction to such a plan.
But "sentimentalists" merely have
misplaced sentiments. Sentimentally,
we believe that if one criminal's
life can save the life of one innocent
babe in the toils of the white or
black plague, human vivisection is
desirable. —Dave MellinkofT
