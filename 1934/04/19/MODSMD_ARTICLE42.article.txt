CAL-INDIAN
RIVALRIES AGAIN
The Bears and Indians renew their
rivalries again Saturday on three
different fields and on a fourth to
morrow while another Stanford team
is putting the finishing touches on
its spring preparation for its meet
ing with the Californians next fall.
Of paramount interest Saturday to
Farm students and the thousands of
home-coming alumni is the Big
Meet, the closest in years, which
will be run, jumped and thrown in
the Stanford Stadium from 1:30 to
3 o'clock.
The Indians, under "Dink"' Tem
pleton, once known as Stanford's
"boy wonder," will be going after
their eleventh straight victory over
California, while the Bears with
Brutus Hamilton in his second year
at the helm and with their strongest
team in years claim that 10 years is
long enough.
BALL TEAM
CLASH IS FINALE
Over on the Sunken Diamond, im
mediately following the track meet,
Stanford's baseball forces face some
what the same situation as will the
California tracksters earlier in the
day. The Cards haven't taken the
Big Series from California since 1931
and their chance of winning iL this
year is gone, with the league-leading
Bears having already won the first
four games of the series.
The Indians are determined, how
ever, that they will not be white
washed and with both of their ace
pitchers, Stan Anderson and Fred
Heringer, ready for duty, the Card
batmen should end the scries with
a win over California.
TENNIS. GOLF
MATCHES ALSO
The Card netmen take the Bears
on in their second meeting of the
season tomorrow. Stanford took the
first matches, but with Sammy Lee
out, or at best in poor condition,
California prospects are looking up.
Over at the Orinda Golf Club to
morrow Stanford and California
linksmen meet in their annual
matches with the Cards somewhat
favored here also. In fact, it looks
like a Stanford week-end right now.
Freshmen of the two schools get
a taste of "Big" competition when
the pea-greeners battle today on the
track and tennis courts. The frosh
track meet is as hard to figure as the
Big Meet, but the Card Babes should
take the tennis matches. Frosh ball
teams were also scheduled to play
Saturday but the Bear Cubs took
the first two games and clinched
the series, obviating the necessity of
playing a third game since they do
not play in a league.
"Tiny" Thornhill will show off his
1934 varsity in a preview on the
varsity practice field tomorrow aft
ernoon which should give grid fans
something on which to base their
calculations for next fall.

Freshmen of the two schools get
a taste of "Big" competition when
the pea-greeners battle today on the
track and tennis courts. The frosh
track meet is as hard to figure as the
Big Meet, but the Card Babes should
take the tennis matches. Frosh ball
teams were also scheduled to play
Saturday but the Bear Cubs took
the first two games and clinched
the series, obviating the necessity of
playing a third game since they do
not play in a league.
"Tiny" Thornhill will show off his
1934 varsity in a preview on the
varsity practice field tomorrow aft
ernoon which should give grid fans
something on which to base their
calculations for next fall.

CAL-INDIAN
RIVALRIES AGAIN
The Bears and Indians renew their
rivalries again Saturday on three
different fields and on a fourth to
morrow while another Stanford team
is putting the finishing touches on
its spring preparation for its meet
ing with the Californians next fall.
Of paramount interest Saturday to
Farm students and the thousands of
home-coming alumni is the Big
Meet, the closest in years, which
will be run, jumped and thrown in
the Stanford Stadium from 1:30 to
3 o'clock.
The Indians, under "Dink"' Tem
pleton, once known as Stanford's
"boy wonder," will be going after
their eleventh straight victory over
California, while the Bears with
Brutus Hamilton in his second year
at the helm and with their strongest
team in years claim that 10 years is
long enough.
BALL TEAM
CLASH IS FINALE
Over on the Sunken Diamond, im
mediately following the track meet,
Stanford's baseball forces face some
what the same situation as will the
California tracksters earlier in the
day. The Cards haven't taken the
Big Series from California since 1931
and their chance of winning iL this
year is gone, with the league-leading
Bears having already won the first
four games of the series.
The Indians are determined, how
ever, that they will not be white
washed and with both of their ace
pitchers, Stan Anderson and Fred
Heringer, ready for duty, the Card
batmen should end the scries with
a win over California.
TENNIS. GOLF
MATCHES ALSO
The Card netmen take the Bears
on in their second meeting of the
season tomorrow. Stanford took the
first matches, but with Sammy Lee
out, or at best in poor condition,
California prospects are looking up.
Over at the Orinda Golf Club to
morrow Stanford and California
linksmen meet in their annual
matches with the Cards somewhat
favored here also. In fact, it looks
like a Stanford week-end right now.
