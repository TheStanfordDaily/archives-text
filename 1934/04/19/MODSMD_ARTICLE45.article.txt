# Teams Begin Final Training for Big Meet
## INDIAN TRACKMEN TAKE LAST HARD WORKOUTS TODAY Big Meet to Begin at 1:30; Meier's Cold Better 
### 
With but one day of really strenu
ous practice remaining, Coach Dink
Templeton's track and field war
riors are planning conscientious
workouts this afternoon followed by
a tapering off process tomorrow, in
order to leave nothing undone that
will not insure their best efforts
against California Saturday in the
forty-first annual Big Meet.

I Stanford's great hurdler and cap-'
i tain, Gus Meier, who was shipped
'to the Stanford Hospital Tuesday
i suffering with a slight cold, has re
| sponded to treatment and will be
dismissed from the institution this
I morning. Meier probably will take
j only a slight workout this afternoon
i if he dons his spikes at all, but will
prance about a bit tomorrow to get
back his "land legs."
Lay-off Beneficial
| Gus's slight lay-off undoubtedly
will do him more good than harm.
The Stanford star is in excellent
: condition as is evidenced by his 23.6
| seconds flight of lows last Saturday
and although he hasn't quite reached
his last year's peak in the highs, the
rest may be just what the doctor
ordered.
The relay problem is still rather
perplexing to Templeton, and last
night Dink was experimenting with
a quartet of A1 Blackman, Joe Bur
ris, "Truck" Dellinger, and "Wild
Man" Dear. The last-named, re
turned to school this quarter, seems
capable of 50 seconds or better in
the 440.
One great advantage in running
this combination will be the fact
thai Dear and Burris will be both
fresh as Templeton plans to hold
both out of the quarter or half
mile, allowing Blackmail and Del
linger to uphold Stanford's honor
in the 440. "Iron man" Nimmo and
George Downing will carry the torch
in the 880.
Kiescl Not in Relay
Word came from Berkeley yester
day that Coach Brutus Hamilton will
not use "Bullet Bob" Kiesel in the
mile relay, but will stick to his old
quartet, of Miller, Street, Van Lo
ben Sels. and Leek, thus permitting
I the blond Bear sprint star to con
i centrate all of his energies in the
100- and 220-yard dashes.
Tuesday's practice session was
marred by the injury of Arne An
derson, transfer pole vaulter from
Menlo J.C., who spiked himself quite
painfully while 'working out. An
derson, a few minutes before his
injury, had cleared 12 feet 6 inches,
and was being looked upon as a pos
sible second threat to the Califor
nia trio of Vantress, Mauger, and
Haskell.
Discus Stars Consistent
In the meantime Slinger Dunn,
the Card's best discus tosser, con
tinues to throw the platter around
the 150-foot mark, while John Ly
man and Howard Buller spin it con
sistently in the neighborhood of 140
feet.
Admission prices for Saturday's
contest will be 55 cents to Stanford
students and $1.10 to the general
public. Students are urged to pur
chase pasteboards at the A.S.S.U.
office before Friday to prevent their
I standing in line at the stadium ticket
booths on Saturday.

Although originally sched
uled to start in the Stanford
Stadium at 1:30 o'clock, accord
ing to a later announcement,
the affair will begin at 1:45
o'clock instead, the javelin and
shot-put being the initial
events, followed by the mile
run. the opening track event,
at 2 o'clock.

Admission prices for Saturday's
contest will be 55 cents to Stanford
students and $1.10 to the general
public. Students are urged to pur
chase pasteboards at the A.S.S.U.
office before Friday to prevent their
I standing in line at the stadium ticket
booths on Saturday.

Although originally sched
uled to start in the Stanford
Stadium at 1:30 o'clock, accord
ing to a later announcement,
the affair will begin at 1:45
o'clock instead, the javelin and
shot-put being the initial
events, followed by the mile
run. the opening track event,
at 2 o'clock.
With but one day of really strenu
ous practice remaining, Coach Dink
Templeton's track and field war
riors are planning conscientious
workouts this afternoon followed by
a tapering off process tomorrow, in
order to leave nothing undone that
will not insure their best efforts
against California Saturday in the
forty-first annual Big Meet.

I Stanford's great hurdler and cap-'
i tain, Gus Meier, who was shipped
'to the Stanford Hospital Tuesday
i suffering with a slight cold, has re
| sponded to treatment and will be
dismissed from the institution this
I morning. Meier probably will take
j only a slight workout this afternoon
i if he dons his spikes at all, but will
prance about a bit tomorrow to get
back his "land legs."
Lay-off Beneficial
| Gus's slight lay-off undoubtedly
will do him more good than harm.
The Stanford star is in excellent
: condition as is evidenced by his 23.6
| seconds flight of lows last Saturday
and although he hasn't quite reached
his last year's peak in the highs, the
rest may be just what the doctor
ordered.
The relay problem is still rather
perplexing to Templeton, and last
night Dink was experimenting with
a quartet of A1 Blackman, Joe Bur
ris, "Truck" Dellinger, and "Wild
Man" Dear. The last-named, re
turned to school this quarter, seems
capable of 50 seconds or better in
the 440.
One great advantage in running
this combination will be the fact
thai Dear and Burris will be both
fresh as Templeton plans to hold
both out of the quarter or half
mile, allowing Blackmail and Del
linger to uphold Stanford's honor
in the 440. "Iron man" Nimmo and
George Downing will carry the torch
in the 880.
Kiescl Not in Relay
Word came from Berkeley yester
day that Coach Brutus Hamilton will
not use "Bullet Bob" Kiesel in the
mile relay, but will stick to his old
quartet, of Miller, Street, Van Lo
ben Sels. and Leek, thus permitting
I the blond Bear sprint star to con
i centrate all of his energies in the
100- and 220-yard dashes.
Tuesday's practice session was
marred by the injury of Arne An
derson, transfer pole vaulter from
Menlo J.C., who spiked himself quite
painfully while 'working out. An
derson, a few minutes before his
injury, had cleared 12 feet 6 inches,
and was being looked upon as a pos
sible second threat to the Califor
nia trio of Vantress, Mauger, and
Haskell.
Discus Stars Consistent
In the meantime Slinger Dunn,
the Card's best discus tosser, con
tinues to throw the platter around
the 150-foot mark, while John Ly
man and Howard Buller spin it con
sistently in the neighborhood of 140
feet.
