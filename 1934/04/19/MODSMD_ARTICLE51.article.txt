# WEALTHY BEGGARS
## 
### 
In Brazil, it was found recently
that many of the supposed beggars I
were wealthy men of the country, i
One beggar of Rio Janeiro owned a j
coffee plantation, and another one j
four houses, all paying a profitable
income. A third had a wife and
daughter traveling in Europe upon
the proceeds of his begging.
