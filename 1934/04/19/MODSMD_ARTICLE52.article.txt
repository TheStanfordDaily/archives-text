# LITTLE BIG MEET DOPE FAVORS CALIFORNIA CUBS
## 
### 
II7ITII the little Big Meet but a single day off, the Cal frosh are pretty much
of a cinch to take six places—3o points right there—while Stanford's
frosh are sure of only three firsts. The Bears can count on wins in the 100,
220. broad jump, pole vault, high jump, and discus, with the local yearlings
reasonably sure of first in the 440, mile, and shot.
George Anderson, Bear phenom, it is generally conceded, is good enough
for 10 points in the sprints. He has run 9.7 and 21.1, which is quite a bit

faster than Papooses Alex Faye and'
Fred Williams can do. Williams, the
football player, has not been able to
shake off any weight, and as a result
cannot t*et all the muscle, bone, and
flesh going quite fast enough.
The 440 will probably fall to Joe
Green of the frosh, as he has a faster
time than any of the Cal one-lap
men. However, the Cal man to be
feared is Jim Helmer, the best high
school 220 man in Northern Califor
nia last year, running for Piedmont.
He repeatedly broke 22 fiat for the
distance, but his best quarter is still
a full second behind Green's.
March a Cinch
Another Stanford cinch win is the
mile, where Captain Rusty March is
figured to outsprint Les Voorhees of
U.C. Mort D'Evelyn, who last week
beat March in 4:39, is a favorite to
cop the third place, as last week's
time shows phenomenal improve
ment, and his fighting finish is some
thing to be reckoned with.
From the Stanford standpoint, it is
just as well not to mention the three
leaping events. The Papooses will be
lucky to get more than seven or eight
points out of the total 27. However,
there may be luck. Chuck Voigt,
the injured Stanford star, will prob
ably concentrate all his energy into
one big leap, and try to get over 21
feet for a first or second in the broad
jump.
Cal Jumper Good
Indian high jumpers Tupper An
thony, John Moller, and Mike Gon
zales have all cleared 5 feet 10 inches
pieviously, but have not been con
sistent, while one Cal man, Haller,
is sure of six feet, and two or three
others can do 5 feet 10 inches. It all
depends on the "breaks," condition,
and luck.
Sole frosh hope in the pole vault is
200-pound Ray Williamson, who
cleared 12 feet in high school, but
whose present si?e seems to defy any
great heights. The Bear frosh have
one man at 12.G, and a host of lesser
lights, so again it depends on the
quota of good and bad breaks.

frosh are sure of only three firsts. The Bears can count on wins in the 100,
220. broad jump, pole vault, high jump, and discus, with the local yearlings
reasonably sure of first in the 440, mile, and shot.
George Anderson, Bear phenom, it is generally conceded, is good enough
for 10 points in the sprints. He has run 9.7 and 21.1, which is quite a bit

faster than Papooses Alex Faye and'
Fred Williams can do. Williams, the
football player, has not been able to
shake off any weight, and as a result
cannot t*et all the muscle, bone, and
flesh going quite fast enough.
The 440 will probably fall to Joe
Green of the frosh, as he has a faster
time than any of the Cal one-lap
men. However, the Cal man to be
feared is Jim Helmer, the best high
school 220 man in Northern Califor
nia last year, running for Piedmont.
He repeatedly broke 22 fiat for the
distance, but his best quarter is still
a full second behind Green's.
March a Cinch
Another Stanford cinch win is the
mile, where Captain Rusty March is
figured to outsprint Les Voorhees of
U.C. Mort D'Evelyn, who last week
beat March in 4:39, is a favorite to
cop the third place, as last week's
time shows phenomenal improve
ment, and his fighting finish is some
thing to be reckoned with.
From the Stanford standpoint, it is
just as well not to mention the three
leaping events. The Papooses will be
lucky to get more than seven or eight
points out of the total 27. However,
there may be luck. Chuck Voigt,
the injured Stanford star, will prob
ably concentrate all his energy into
one big leap, and try to get over 21
feet for a first or second in the broad
jump.
Cal Jumper Good
Indian high jumpers Tupper An
thony, John Moller, and Mike Gon
zales have all cleared 5 feet 10 inches
pieviously, but have not been con
sistent, while one Cal man, Haller,
is sure of six feet, and two or three
others can do 5 feet 10 inches. It all
depends on the "breaks," condition,
and luck.
Sole frosh hope in the pole vault is
200-pound Ray Williamson, who
cleared 12 feet in high school, but
whose present si?e seems to defy any
great heights. The Bear frosh have
one man at 12.G, and a host of lesser
lights, so again it depends on the
quota of good and bad breaks.
II7ITII the little Big Meet but a single day off, the Cal frosh are pretty much
of a cinch to take six places—3o points right there—while Stanford's
frosh are sure of only three firsts. The Bears can count on wins in the 100,
220. broad jump, pole vault, high jump, and discus, with the local yearlings
reasonably sure of first in the 440, mile, and shot.
