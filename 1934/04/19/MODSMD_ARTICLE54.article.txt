# CARDINAL GOLFERS MEET BEAR SQUAD; CONCEDED MARGIN
## 
### 
When Stanford meets California at
j Orinda in the annual clash between
I the opposing golf teams tomorrow,
j Stanford will be figured as the out
standing favorite, though Lawson
Little is not leading the team into
battle.
At the present time Stanford has
j a formidable group of tournament
j players, while from the showing
they have made elsewhere the Cali
' fornia men have had little experi
ence.
In the Northern California Ama
i teur, which was started last week
J over the course that will carry the
play in the Bear matches, Stanford
| placed eight men in the champion -
i ship flight and has three still in the
' running at the quarter-finals. Cali
' fornia didn't qualify a single man.
Even though they have not been
j doing much, the California men may
I surprise as at least six of them are
' figured to play far under 80. Glen
| Kazebeer has been their leadoff man
| during the preliminary tournaments
: during the year and has done an
! excellent job in that position. He
j played here last year in the previous
| matches. Others on his team that
( are figured to do well are Bob Males,
! Archie Andrews, Mason Buffington,
| Fred Herron, and Charles Wilson.
