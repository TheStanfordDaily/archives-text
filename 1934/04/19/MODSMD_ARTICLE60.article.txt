# 'GEORGE BARNWELL' TO BE PRODUCED BY DRAMA SOCIETY
## Clubb Named Director Of Amusing Tragedy 
### 
Lillo's amusing tragedy, "George
Barnwell; or, The London Mer
chant," has been selected by Sword
and Sandals as its second reading of
the spring quarter. First acted in
1759 at Drury Lane Theatre in Lon
don, it was held to be highly affect
ing and eminently good as a moral
lesson to the unguarded young.
At present, however, it strikes
readers no more seriously than such
obsolete tear-jerkers as "Ten Nights
in a Bar-room" or "The Sti'eets of
New York." Concerned with a
weak-minded apprentice, it details
that unhappy fellow's too soft an
swers to the beguiling smiles of the
wicked wanton Milwood, who pro
pels his downward on the path to
ruin.
The reading of this tragical history
of Master George Barnwell is to be
under the direction of Professor
Merrill Clubb, who has set tryouts
for this afternoon at 3 o'clock in the
Little Theatre.
The play includes parts for three
women and about five men. Of the
women, villainess Millwood is the
most striking role, although that of
the piteous Maria, George's true
love, has its own distinct merits. Male
characters include Barnwell; his
golden-hearted employer, Merchant
Thorowgood; George's otherwise
anonymous uncle; his fellow-ap
prentice, Trueman; and several les
ser persons, including the Gaoler of
Newgate in whose hands rests the
terrifying finale.
Tryouts for "George Barnwell" are
open to all students interested.
Sword and Sandals urges interested
persons who have not thus far been
able to display themselves suffi
ciently 011 a stage, to appear.
