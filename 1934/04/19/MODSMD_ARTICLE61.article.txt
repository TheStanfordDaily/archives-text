AIRLINESâ€”One man's meat con
tinues to be another man's poison, as
witness the case of A1 Jolson. Though
heartily disliked by some, the erst
while mammy-singer was recalled
to the air by public demand after
being released by his sponsor, who
felt that Jolson wasn't a sufficiently
large drawing card. With all due
credit to Whiteman, however, it must
be admitted that Jolson is the mak
ing of their co-starring program.
As his dramatic skits furnish the
needed punch to a program that
would otherwise become boring
after an hour of music alone, and
though the .skits sometimes become
too sentimental, they are exactly
what appeals to the majority of the
air audience.
