# Oral Examinations Loom For Independent Study
## 
### 
Since last autumn life has been
just one book after another for Stan
ford's 15 or 16 independent study
students, who are taking their work
under the Independent Study Com
mittee, headed by Dr. E. E. Robinson.
Miss L. E. Fast, secretary of In
dependent Study Committee, has
just mailed to the independent study
students schedules of forthcoming
oral examinations. The orals will
be held from the middle to the end
of May, and candidates are brought
up in alphabetical sequence.
Each student is questioned for ap
proximately two hours by six pro
fessors. Dr. Hugh McDowell Clokie
of Stanford Political Science Depart
ment has been coaching the group.

Hal Edelen and Emil Cowing, Card
hoopmen, formed a star forward pass
combination at Piedmont High.
