MARLOWE OFF THE SHELF
The Players challenge their public:
When the Executive Board of the
Palo Alto Community Theatre voted
its approval of a proposed produc
tion of Christopher Marlowe's flam
ing drama, "The Tragical History of
Doctor Faustus," they took a step at
| once bold and canny.
With a heavy deficit following
their amusing production of "Secret
; Service" they dared not risk the pos
j sible indifference of their public to
;so little-known a masterpiece. At
j the samo time they saw fit to en
! courage the production of so splen
did and thrilling a part of English
| drama.
Therefore the play was scheduled
| for a special production rather than
1 as one of their regular monthly per
formances. This will at once show
; their willingness to face the classics
| without the fear of falling into un
i profitable pedantry and allow them
I to test the altitude of their audi
i ences to other than modern plays.
If the experiment with this trag
od" is as successful as the produc
tion last year of Sheridan's "The
i Critic,'' it is probable that more pro
ductions of the sort may be expected.
Productions which, while demanding
large casts and a considerable added
j expenditure of time and energy, are
I basically far more profoundly satis
fying to the intelligent audience than
| a spare diet of modern comedies and
I a good share of modern dramas,
historical or contemporary.
On the campus, Sword and San r
, dais has tested an allegedly indif
ferent audience with a widely varied
! program which has included repre-
I sentative plays from the wide gamut
[ of English drama. This audience has
! responded as warmly and consist
i ently to Goldsmith and Congrave as
j to Coward, to John Webster, and
| Ibsen as to Robert Sherwood.
Now this same audience will have
' an opportunity to prove itself cog
| nizant of the superior beauties and
I power of such a master as Marlowe,
' too-infrequently seen because a
I legend of bald-headed superficiality
; has, justly or unjustly as shall soon
Ibe demonstrated, discouraged the
iniabic pentameter and unduly ex
-1 altcd abrupt modern sticompthy. It
is to be hoped that the audience
will appreciate the necessity of in
dicating its preference or at least its
appreciation of the former, used as
gloriously as Marlowe used it.
