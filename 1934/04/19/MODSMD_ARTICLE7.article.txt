# Clokie Lauds National Plan
## 
### 
Professor Hugh McDowell Clokie
last night addressed the Interna
tional Relations Club in the Wo
men's Clubhouse on "International
Aspects of National Planning."
Under laissez-faire conditions,
said the speaker, international trade
was a competition between indi
vidual merchants in the various na
tions. With increased national plan
ning, economic transactions will
tend to become between the mer
chants of each country as a unit,
and national and racial animosities
will be intensified.
Professor Clokie believes that na
tional planning will have the effect
of making the causes of wars more
obvious with regard to the nation
alistic economic interests. There
will be no need for consuls, for all
economic transactions will be be
tween nations. The Open Door pol
icy will also become outworn.
The only way that may prevent
the sharpening of antagonism be
tween nations is Communism, said
the speaker, and it is very doubtful
both if it will occur and if it will
have that desired effect.
