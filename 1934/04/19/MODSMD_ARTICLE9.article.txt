# Stanford Colors Decided by Journalism, Says Farm Tale
## 
### 
Journalism decided the official
Stanford cardinal color just 42 years
ago this spring. The selection of the
cardinal is an unusual story in itself.
During the full of 1891 when the
choice of an appropriate school color
for Stanford was under discussion,
gold was finally adopted. There was
considerable dissatisfaction, how
ever, because blue and gold were
the colors of the University of Cali
fornia.
One of the champions of cardinal
had had a gigantic magenta .silk
handkerchief which he had waved
energetically, but fn vain, at the
color-choosing deliberations of the
autumn of '91. The proponents of
cardinal did not lose heart but bided
their time.
The initial football game between
the Institutions at Stanford and

, Berkeley was arranged to be played
in the spring of 1892. Just before the
contest an A.S.S.U. meeting was
held, with but few students in at
tendance; the action of the autumn
was reversed and cardinal adopted
i as school color.
This action caused much friction,
because the exponents of gold felt
the cardinalites had "stolen a march"
I on them, and had "railroaded" red
! into being the official color.
Amid the heat of controversy,
I Stanford won the football game a
1 few days later. The San Francisco
newspapers announced in screaming
headlines: "CARDINAL TRIUMPHS
OVER'BLUE AND GOLD," and the
color debated was settled forever.
