It's a far cry from the barna
cle-inviting, water-logging
"bathing suit" of yesteryear
to Gantner WIKIES!
Only WIKIES have that pat
ented high waist that won'troll
down ... that improved elastic
built-in Supporter... that new
Gantner-process, quick-dry
ing yarn. Only WIKIES retain
their smartness after in
numerable wettings.
They're not WIKIES if
they're not by Qantner!
