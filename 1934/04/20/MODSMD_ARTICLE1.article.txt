## WIDE ARRAY OF FESTIVE, SPORT EVENTS PLANNED Annual Junior Water Carnival to Open Celebration; Broadcasting Car Will Cruise on Campus; Committee Will Provide Rides 
### GEORGE WILSON 
"Hello Alumni!" is the slogan today as gratis from '97 to return to the
campus for the first his Homecoming celebration in three years.
A group from the South is expected to arrive this morning on the Lark
and Sunset, to be here in plenty of time for all the events crowded into the

three-day program which begins of-'
ficially with the Water Carnival this
afternoon.
This group will be met by Aylett
Cotton's transportation committee,
which, with the co-operation of
others on the campus, arc trying to
see that everyone returning is driven
to the campus, and anywhere around
the campus that is necessary.
To Play Card Songs
The fun will start this afternoon
when a broadcasting car will have
arrived on the campus to dii-ect stu
dents as well as alumni to the vari
ous events as the time for each
approaches, and add to the festive
atmosphere by playing records of
Stanford songs while going up and
down the Row.
The contingent arriving tomorrow
morning at Palo Alto will probably
think they're really back in the good
old- days when they see the tallyho
being driven by Mr. Wood, venerable
liveryman from up on King's Moun
tain. The announcement was made
yesterday that he will be on the
campus all morning tomorrow to
drive those alumni around who
spurn more stream-lined vehicles.
As soon as the carnival is over at
Ihe pools there will be a special foot
ball scrimmage held over at the
practice field, to which all the grads
have been invited.
Evening Events
Then the first affairs which the
alumni will put on themselves will
be the stag dinner and track rally at
the Encina Commons, and the dinner
and Hi Jinks for the alumnae held
at the Women's gym. Student and
faculty members are welcome to at
tend either. The band and Glee Club
will entertain. Dink Templeton will
speak at the rally, and Masquers will
put on skits at the Hi Jinks.
Next on the program, the alumni
will find that any who dare to face
the dangers of the Court of Mephi
stopheles at the Masque Ball are
welcome to do so, provided they
come equipped with a mask of some
kind. A misprint in the official
Home-coming program says the Ball
lasts from 9 until 11 o'clock. The
dance really goes on until 1 o'clock,
and this does not mean that grads
are expected to go home at 11
o'clock.
Those up early tomorrow morning
will find ail departments of the
school holding open houses from 9
until 11 o'clock. More information
about these, as well as of the sports
events of the day, will be found in
other sections of today's Daily.
Alumni Meetings
The baseball game between teams
composed entirely of alumi will be
followed by one of Sam McDonalds
famous barbecues over at the Fac
ulty Clubhouse, where class re
unions and a general alumni meet
ing will be held. This year the Class
of '09 will celebrate its 25th anni
versary.
