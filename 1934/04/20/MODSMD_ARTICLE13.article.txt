# Sororities Probe Presented
## A.W.S Group Gives Report Women to Express Opinion In Secret Ballot Soon 
### 
Tine culmination of more than
two months' investigation of the
Stanford sorority system by the
A.W.S. commission organized for
this purpose comes in the report j
printed below. This report is not j
an affair brought up by the ad- ,
ministration. It was initiated by j
students; the work on it was done j
by students; and the final judgment
of it will be up to the students, ac- !
cording to the commission.
The commission has endeavored
to present a fair, unbiased consid
eration of the matter and will put i
the question to the rest of the cam- '
pus next week.
PREFACE
A.W.S. Sorority Commission Report
The A.W.S. sorority commission, '
representing all groups of the campus ;
for the purpose of impartial investi
gation and discussion of the so- |
rority system. The results were to j
be tabulated in a single report.
This was not possible. The only
method of procedure which the
commission could take was to have j
one group present disadvantages, j
the other advantages.
As it is submitted, the report is
in two parts. Each part was written j
by a group of volunteers who j
wanted to present one side. The i
result is a report of two expressions j
of opinion. No statement on the
list either of assets or liabilities is j
to be construed as representative
of a conclusion reached by the ;
whole commission.
ADVANTAGES
1. People love organizations. Like i
will flock together in clubs. It is
better to have organized fraternity |
groups under control than miscel
laneous independent clubs. Snob
bishness exists in social cliques i
more intensively than in fraterni
ties and has no tangible center in
the latter which can be attached. |
2. The fraternity fosters friend- i
ships. One can be friends only with
a limited number. There are dan- '
gers of forgetting college's oppor
tunity for friendship if one tries to '
know equally well all of a large '
student body.
3. The fraternity brings together
girls of varied tastes and activities
so Ihat it is broader than a de
partment club. Fraternity encour- '
ages the appreciation of all lines of
scholarship and forms bonds of con
geniality bigger than the interest
in one's individual affairs or that i
found in social cliques based on the '
Similarity of interests.
4. The fraternity stands for the
best college ideals. It is a group
unit through which it is easy to
reach and influence individual stu
dents. Its close relationships make
possible a stronger influence on the
individual than faculty or dormi
tory alone can have. As a group a
chapter can more effectively for
ward college activities than can
girls working individually.
5. The national charter in a fra
rnity broadens the viewpoint be
cause of its interest in and appre
ciation for other colegcs. Thereby
it counteracts the prevailing pro
vincialism and egotism of most
campuses. This contact with other
colleges gives the fraternity woman
contact and a possibility for friend
-1 lip throughout the country.
6. The fraternity holds the inter
est of alutnnae and keeps them in
touch v/ith college, its work and
its needs, and brings them back for
visits.
7. The fraternity stands for high
scholarship and helps members to
('') good consistent work. For these
reasons study tables have been es
tablished in the houses and a grade
rating set up to be met by pros
pective members.
6. The fraternity recognizes that
intellectual pursuits are not the
only thing necessary to develop
womanly citizens. r rhe size of stu
dent bodies and modern educational
methods make it impossible for a
college to do much for students
outside the class room. Fraternities
give members the development and
training found in the cohesive or
ganization of an Oxford college.
Through chapter social activities
id support of college enterprises,
fraternities extend in a measure this
same sort of help to the rest of
the student body.
9. Close friendships and a com
munity of interests in a chapter de
velop unselfishness, adaptability, co
operation, tact, honor, and in it ia
i ve. In the student body many a
student's talent atrophies and her
initiative power remains undevel
oped because there are no demands
for its exercise upon every student,
while in a fraternity each girl mem
ber must carry her share of work,
activity, and responsibility.
10. As part of a national organi
zation with high ideals a chapter
must strive to represent its fra
ternity well. It is constantly urged
to appreciate its duty as an orga
nized member of the community.
This, with the chapter's opportuni
ties for service and hospitality to
students and friends, encourages in
vvery member tolerance, generosity,
a sense of personal responsibility,
thoughtfulness, consideration for
others, and interest in a world be
yond one's own door.
11. Chapter fellowship gives
pleasure to individuals and encour
ages each one to make the most of
./ne's self without forgetting one's
obligations not to advance at the
expense of others. Growth comes
through pleasure as well as through
work, so this companionship means
much at the time.
12. Chapter life with its duties
and responsibility more nearly ap
roaches home life than does any
dormitory plan.
13. The test of college organiza
tion is: does it advance or hinder
ihe real object of college? Does it
make for higher or lower scholar
ship? Investigations and reports on
universities commend fraternity
bapters for help along both these
Jines.
14. Fraternities give pleasure to
members, college and alumnae. In
zeal for the good of the whole, one
group should not be denied the
right of its own happiness. <
15. The fraternity has become
nore of a living group than a se
cret society, for it is recognized that
all are based upon the identical
principles of truth, honor, friend
ship, and loyalty. The difference
among the fraternities is merely in
the varied manner or procedure of
initiation ceremonies, in order to
impress their members with the
.significance of these ideals.
Hi. The process of selecting new
members for (he fraternity is one
open 1o change and is an existing
evil which can be minimized or
completely eliminated by a com
mon sense revision of the present
rushing system and rules. Many
J: the objections to the fraternity
system are objections merely to the
existing rushing system found at
Stanford rather than inherent dis
advantages of the fraternity itself.
And we feel that the time could be
more profitably spent in formulat
ing a plan for the reorganization
t rushing rather than the abolition
of sororities.

DISADVANTAGES
1. The burden of rushing on the
sorority women
The intensive effort required for
a successful season of rushing can
not help taking its toll from the
sorority women. The weeks of ac
tual rushing demand a great deal of
time and energy. It is well known
that scholarship takes a drop dur
ing this period; and women who
try to meet the requirements of
regular academic work as well as
the requirements of rushing often
find their health impaired. There
is also a financial burden. The av
erage sorority member contributes
seventeen dollars for each rushing
season — even with the simplest
standards of entertaihment that
Pan-Hellenic can devise.
During this time of highly or
ganized entertaining, the sorority
women must be selecting the
"class." This is an extremely diffi
cult task; for unless the sorority is
a distinct type, there must inevi
tably be differences of opinion in
this selection. Many unfortunate
incidents occur, such as angry dis
agreements between sorority mem
bers, the disappointment of the
sorority member whose freshman
friend is "dinged"' by her sorority,
the interference of alumnae who
insist upon the sorority's taking a
certain freshman that the sorority
does not want, and so on.
But the really insidious thing
about rushing is that it is not con
fined to the period of entertainment
—it is going on all the time. Dur
ing the summer, the sorority women
are busy getting acquainted with,
if not actually rushing, the enter
ing women near their homes. Dur
ing fall quarter they are careful to
make a good impression on the
freshmen, and upon those who j
might influence them. The sorority |
women are expected to learn the
names of as many freshmen as
they can, and to cultivate the ac- !
quaintance of any who are likely !
to be rushees. This was reasonably
possible when there were fewer j
than a hundred freshmen, but with J
over two hundred it becomes an |
almost hopeless task.
2. Hardships to special groups of
women
The cruel discrimination against
some girls is unjustifiable, and in !
an educational institution of today
almost unbelievable. Certain girls
often come to college unaware that !
they are not eligible for rushing, j
because of a circumstance which is i
completely beyond their control.
There are legacies who do not
happen to be just the sort of girl
the house wants. They are keenly i
disappointed if they are not bid, '
but they are in a much worse posi
tion when they are. And legacies
who do happen to be just the sort •
of girl the house wants often won- 1
der whether they were bid only
because of their connections.
Transfers who have previously af
filiated with a national sorority
having a local chapter are in much
the same situation, with the added
condition of almost irrevocable
membership in a distant chapter 1
that prevents them from joining a
congenial group on this campus.
Transfers who have previously af
filiated with a national sorority not
having a local chapter are deprived
even of that one chance to join a
congenial group. Even transfers
who have not previously affiliated
with a national sorority are at a
great disadvantage, because the '
sororities prefer to pledge fresh
men. Since the number of trans
fers is increasing from year to year,
their predicament is a growing
problem.
New women who are lacking in
the social graces — the very ones j
who would benefit most by the i
training a sorority provides — are J
the ones most often overlooked in
rushing. A sorority is not a welfare
bureau; it cannot afford to take
girls who are socially backward. As
a result, these girls are made to
feel their social inferiority even
more, and this reaction impedes 1
their normal social development. It
seems hardly fair that an educa- '
tional institution, suposedly de
signed to develop the fullest capa- j

cities of all the students, should
give them a rating at the beginning
of their callege career that is so
categorical.
:j. Over-emphasis of the social
For a sorority to maintain its
position of social prestige on the'
campus, it is necessary that it stress '
rather trivial superficialities —at the j
expense of the more fundamental
aims of college life. A sorority must I
make a good appearance before the;
campus in general, and the new
women in particular. The group
interest of the sorority is focused on
"getting a class." With the energy
of the group directed at this goal,
the real purposes of college are ob
scured. And this perversion of val
ues affects not only the sorority
women but also others who, being
impressed by the social prestige of
the sorority women, follow the ex
ample that they set.
4. Limitation of associations
It is essentially true that a soro
rity limits the friendships of its
members. While it is obvious that j
I here can be, and sometimes are, j
close friendships between members j
of different houses, or between Row |
women and Hall women, still it is I
apparent that the bulk of close |
friendships are formed within a 1
house. This is only a natural result
of the fact that a girl chooses her ,
friends from among those who are !
most often with her. A freshman i
girl, at an extremely plastic and !
formative age, is asked to select— j
on such an unnatural basis as rush- j
ing parties—one group with whom !
she will live during the remainder |
of her college life.
A college includes many varied
types of girls, and each girl should i
be able to choose her friends from :
all types with equal freedom. Dur
ing her four years of college she •
should be able to select her friends '
without the influence of sorority j
grouping.
5. Hindrance to the social-educative
program of the University
An individual sorority house, be
cause it is a part of a national or- '
ganization, cannot be an integral ,
part of the University residence
system. When a disciplinary case \
arises in a sorority, that sorority is
likely to depend upon the authority ;
of the national organization to
which it belongs, instead of sub- j
mitting the case to A.W.S. officials. |
These sororities, then, practice a
sort of extra-legal autonomy; and
under these circumstances it is im
possible for A.W.S. officials to main- !
tain a uniform enforcement of so- |

cial regulations.
Because the individual sorority
must compete with other sororities
in the race for prestige, a sorority
is obliged to keep its problems se
cret. Without this factor, the so
rorities could benefit by an inter
change of suggestions.
The work of the University in
creating a spirit of citizenship in
the freshman dormitory has been
impeded by the pledging and initia
tion of freshmen. These freshmen
give their first consideration to the
sorority and lose interest in the
affairs of the dormitory.
The work of the University in
character building has been mate
rially hindered by the division of
women into the groups, selected and
unselected. It is detrimental to a
student's emotional adjustment to
have a consciousness either of su
periority or inferiority, to have the
complacency of smugness, or Ihe
bitterness of social bewilderment.
(5. Artificial grouping
The presence of sororities on the
campus creates two distinct classes
—Row and Hall. Until this i year
those groups have been approxi
mately equal in number. Next year
there will be about 27 per cent Row
and 73 per cent Hall. In the very
restriction of proportionate num
bers the Row will become more se
lective, more exclusive, and more
enviable. This situation will pro
duce a breach between the two
groups that will hinder the tradi
tional spirit of Stanford democracy.
The sorority system does not ex
press the spirit of the present; it is
a system that looks to the past for
its excuse for being and the pattern
of its form.
7. Rushing (its effects and condi
tions as taken primarily from
Roblc this year).
Any person living in Roble dur
ing the last rushing period and who
was in a position to know what was
happening can describe it as nothing
less than completely emotional.
Even to an old girl, who was less
affected than any other member in
the hall, the high state of nervous
tension was apparent.
There is no question that during
this time studying was neglected
and| the regular routine entirely
disrupted. Bull sessions at all hours,
disregard for all quiet hours, and
continuous speculation and thought
on one subject reversed the condi
tions of ordinary living. The sense
of balance and values was com
pletely distorted.
These were outward manifesta
tions of what was happening; they
would have been apparent even to
a visitor. However, to realize the
effects and the far-reaching results
of the rushing system one must
come to concrete, individual cases.
There was not a new girl in Ro
ble who was not in some way af
fected. It was the culmination of
intimations and whisperings and
inferences which had surounded her
all fall quarter. With the lifting of
the taboo, she could talk openly
about what every girl had thought
of for three months. The mere
rules of the relations of row and
new women during the fall quarter
had over-emphasized the impor
tance of the problem.
It would probably be unfair to
say that new women choose their
friends with an eye to their house
connections or possibilities. But. it
is admitted that, consciously or not,
this does influence their estimation
and evaluation of the girls with
whom they are living.
In the following list of effects and
results of rushing, an attempt has

been made to give representative
examples which will give a pic- ;
ture of the whole.
1. This year there were girls who
received no invitations at all, or
only one or two. The first reaction
in that, case was to build up a de- '
fense, to show everyone else that
they didn't care. But in reality,
there was a turn to self-analysis,
to ask the question, "What is the
matter with me?"
2. In direct contrast with these ;
girls were those who had to do the i
eliminating instead of the houses.
Their mixed feelings of exultation :
and elation were often unfounded.
Disappointments later in the week
were harder than they would have
been in the beginning.
But all of these girls were not
disappointed, and uncertain though
they were, they were already
stamped with a superiority which
is never mentioned but often felt. |
Under this grouping also comes i
the girl who couldn't decide, even 1
up to pledge night. Her own state
of emotion and the effect of it on
others is difficult to estimate, but
certainly far-reaching.
3. There were many who were not
rushed by the house which they
wanted, and so refused all invita
tions with fatal resignation. Their
decision was complete. The major
ity of these girls will probably be
very happy in dormitories, but
their adjustment to college life in a
hall in contrast to their plan for it
in a sorority will not be immediate.
And it will take more than a few
months before they will be able to
have an unprejudiced attitude to
ward the girls in the house which
did not take them.
4. There are always those who
join a house for the sole sake of j
going vow. The unhappiness of
these girls while making a decision
is only the beginning of three years'
unhappiness in a second - choice
group. 4
If more detailed cases were given,
as they could be, the illustrations
would show unpleasantness and in
justice.
To see truly what happens dur
ing a rushing season, to conceive
its immediate and ultimate effects
as they have been this year and as
they will be next year, is to be
convinced that in them alone is jus
tification for the abolition of the
sorority system.
Tine culmination of more than
two months' investigation of the
Stanford sorority system by the
A.W.S. commission organized for
this purpose comes in the report j
printed below. This report is not j
an affair brought up by the ad- ,
ministration. It was initiated by j
students; the work on it was done j
by students; and the final judgment
of it will be up to the students, ac- !
cording to the commission.

eration of the matter and will put i
the question to the rest of the cam- '
pus next week.

which it belongs, instead of sub- j
mitting the case to A.W.S. officials. |
These sororities, then, practice a
sort of extra-legal autonomy; and
under these circumstances it is im
possible for A.W.S. officials to main- !
tain a uniform enforcement of so- |

cial regulations.
Because the individual sorority
must compete with other sororities
in the race for prestige, a sorority
is obliged to keep its problems se
cret. Without this factor, the so
rorities could benefit by an inter
change of suggestions.
The work of the University in
creating a spirit of citizenship in
the freshman dormitory has been
impeded by the pledging and initia
tion of freshmen. These freshmen
give their first consideration to the
sorority and lose interest in the
affairs of the dormitory.
The work of the University in
character building has been mate
rially hindered by the division of
women into the groups, selected and
unselected. It is detrimental to a
student's emotional adjustment to
have a consciousness either of su
periority or inferiority, to have the
complacency of smugness, or Ihe
bitterness of social bewilderment.
(5. Artificial grouping
The presence of sororities on the
campus creates two distinct classes
—Row and Hall. Until this i year
those groups have been approxi
mately equal in number. Next year
there will be about 27 per cent Row
and 73 per cent Hall. In the very
restriction of proportionate num
bers the Row will become more se
lective, more exclusive, and more
enviable. This situation will pro
duce a breach between the two
groups that will hinder the tradi
tional spirit of Stanford democracy.
The sorority system does not ex
press the spirit of the present; it is
a system that looks to the past for
its excuse for being and the pattern
of its form.
7. Rushing (its effects and condi
tions as taken primarily from
Roblc this year).
Any person living in Roble dur
ing the last rushing period and who
was in a position to know what was
happening can describe it as nothing
less than completely emotional.
Even to an old girl, who was less
affected than any other member in
the hall, the high state of nervous
tension was apparent.
There is no question that during
this time studying was neglected
and| the regular routine entirely
disrupted. Bull sessions at all hours,
disregard for all quiet hours, and
continuous speculation and thought
on one subject reversed the condi
tions of ordinary living. The sense
of balance and values was com
pletely distorted.
These were outward manifesta
tions of what was happening; they
would have been apparent even to
a visitor. However, to realize the
effects and the far-reaching results
of the rushing system one must
come to concrete, individual cases.
There was not a new girl in Ro
ble who was not in some way af
fected. It was the culmination of
intimations and whisperings and
inferences which had surounded her
all fall quarter. With the lifting of
the taboo, she could talk openly
about what every girl had thought
of for three months. The mere
rules of the relations of row and
new women during the fall quarter
had over-emphasized the impor
tance of the problem.
It would probably be unfair to
say that new women choose their
friends with an eye to their house
connections or possibilities. But. it
is admitted that, consciously or not,
this does influence their estimation
and evaluation of the girls with
whom they are living.
In the following list of effects and
results of rushing, an attempt has

been made to give representative
examples which will give a pic- ;
ture of the whole.
1. This year there were girls who
received no invitations at all, or
only one or two. The first reaction
in that, case was to build up a de- '
fense, to show everyone else that
they didn't care. But in reality,
there was a turn to self-analysis,
to ask the question, "What is the
matter with me?"
2. In direct contrast with these ;
girls were those who had to do the i
eliminating instead of the houses.
Their mixed feelings of exultation :
and elation were often unfounded.
Disappointments later in the week
were harder than they would have
been in the beginning.
But all of these girls were not
disappointed, and uncertain though
they were, they were already
stamped with a superiority which
is never mentioned but often felt. |
Under this grouping also comes i
the girl who couldn't decide, even 1
up to pledge night. Her own state
of emotion and the effect of it on
others is difficult to estimate, but
certainly far-reaching.
3. There were many who were not
rushed by the house which they
wanted, and so refused all invita
tions with fatal resignation. Their
decision was complete. The major
ity of these girls will probably be
very happy in dormitories, but
their adjustment to college life in a
hall in contrast to their plan for it
in a sorority will not be immediate.
And it will take more than a few
months before they will be able to
have an unprejudiced attitude to
ward the girls in the house which
did not take them.
4. There are always those who
join a house for the sole sake of j
going vow. The unhappiness of
these girls while making a decision
is only the beginning of three years'
unhappiness in a second - choice
group. 4
If more detailed cases were given,
as they could be, the illustrations
would show unpleasantness and in
justice.
To see truly what happens dur
ing a rushing season, to conceive
its immediate and ultimate effects
as they have been this year and as
they will be next year, is to be
convinced that in them alone is jus
tification for the abolition of the
sorority system.
Tine culmination of more than
two months' investigation of the
Stanford sorority system by the
A.W.S. commission organized for
this purpose comes in the report j
printed below. This report is not j
an affair brought up by the ad- ,
ministration. It was initiated by j
students; the work on it was done j
by students; and the final judgment
of it will be up to the students, ac- !
cording to the commission.
The commission has endeavored
to present a fair, unbiased consid
eration of the matter and will put i
the question to the rest of the cam- '
pus next week.
PREFACE
A.W.S. Sorority Commission Report
The A.W.S. sorority commission, '
representing all groups of the campus ;
for the purpose of impartial investi
gation and discussion of the so- |
rority system. The results were to j
be tabulated in a single report.
This was not possible. The only
method of procedure which the
commission could take was to have j
one group present disadvantages, j
the other advantages.
As it is submitted, the report is
in two parts. Each part was written j
by a group of volunteers who j
wanted to present one side. The i
result is a report of two expressions j
of opinion. No statement on the
list either of assets or liabilities is j
to be construed as representative
of a conclusion reached by the ;
whole commission.
ADVANTAGES
1. People love organizations. Like i
will flock together in clubs. It is
better to have organized fraternity |
groups under control than miscel
laneous independent clubs. Snob
bishness exists in social cliques i
more intensively than in fraterni
ties and has no tangible center in
the latter which can be attached. |
2. The fraternity fosters friend- i
ships. One can be friends only with
a limited number. There are dan- '
gers of forgetting college's oppor
tunity for friendship if one tries to '
know equally well all of a large '
student body.
3. The fraternity brings together
girls of varied tastes and activities
so Ihat it is broader than a de
partment club. Fraternity encour- '
ages the appreciation of all lines of
scholarship and forms bonds of con
geniality bigger than the interest
in one's individual affairs or that i
found in social cliques based on the '
Similarity of interests.
4. The fraternity stands for the
best college ideals. It is a group
unit through which it is easy to
reach and influence individual stu
dents. Its close relationships make
possible a stronger influence on the
individual than faculty or dormi
tory alone can have. As a group a
chapter can more effectively for
ward college activities than can
girls working individually.
5. The national charter in a fra
rnity broadens the viewpoint be
cause of its interest in and appre
ciation for other colegcs. Thereby
it counteracts the prevailing pro
vincialism and egotism of most
campuses. This contact with other
colleges gives the fraternity woman
contact and a possibility for friend
-1 lip throughout the country.
6. The fraternity holds the inter
est of alutnnae and keeps them in
touch v/ith college, its work and
its needs, and brings them back for
visits.
7. The fraternity stands for high
scholarship and helps members to
('') good consistent work. For these
reasons study tables have been es
tablished in the houses and a grade
rating set up to be met by pros
pective members.
6. The fraternity recognizes that
intellectual pursuits are not the
only thing necessary to develop
womanly citizens. r rhe size of stu
dent bodies and modern educational
methods make it impossible for a
college to do much for students
outside the class room. Fraternities
give members the development and
training found in the cohesive or
ganization of an Oxford college.
Through chapter social activities
id support of college enterprises,
fraternities extend in a measure this
same sort of help to the rest of
the student body.
9. Close friendships and a com
munity of interests in a chapter de
velop unselfishness, adaptability, co
operation, tact, honor, and in it ia
i ve. In the student body many a
student's talent atrophies and her
initiative power remains undevel
oped because there are no demands
for its exercise upon every student,
while in a fraternity each girl mem
ber must carry her share of work,
activity, and responsibility.
10. As part of a national organi
zation with high ideals a chapter
must strive to represent its fra
ternity well. It is constantly urged
to appreciate its duty as an orga
nized member of the community.
This, with the chapter's opportuni
ties for service and hospitality to
students and friends, encourages in
vvery member tolerance, generosity,
a sense of personal responsibility,
thoughtfulness, consideration for
others, and interest in a world be
yond one's own door.
11. Chapter fellowship gives
pleasure to individuals and encour
ages each one to make the most of
./ne's self without forgetting one's
obligations not to advance at the
expense of others. Growth comes
through pleasure as well as through
work, so this companionship means
much at the time.
12. Chapter life with its duties
and responsibility more nearly ap
roaches home life than does any
dormitory plan.
13. The test of college organiza
tion is: does it advance or hinder
ihe real object of college? Does it
make for higher or lower scholar
ship? Investigations and reports on
universities commend fraternity
bapters for help along both these
Jines.
14. Fraternities give pleasure to
members, college and alumnae. In
zeal for the good of the whole, one
group should not be denied the
right of its own happiness. <
15. The fraternity has become
nore of a living group than a se
cret society, for it is recognized that
all are based upon the identical
principles of truth, honor, friend
ship, and loyalty. The difference
among the fraternities is merely in
the varied manner or procedure of
initiation ceremonies, in order to
impress their members with the
.significance of these ideals.
Hi. The process of selecting new
members for (he fraternity is one
open 1o change and is an existing
evil which can be minimized or
completely eliminated by a com
mon sense revision of the present
rushing system and rules. Many
J: the objections to the fraternity
system are objections merely to the
existing rushing system found at
Stanford rather than inherent dis
advantages of the fraternity itself.
And we feel that the time could be
more profitably spent in formulat
ing a plan for the reorganization
t rushing rather than the abolition
of sororities.

DISADVANTAGES
1. The burden of rushing on the
sorority women
The intensive effort required for
a successful season of rushing can
not help taking its toll from the
sorority women. The weeks of ac
tual rushing demand a great deal of
time and energy. It is well known
that scholarship takes a drop dur
ing this period; and women who
try to meet the requirements of
regular academic work as well as
the requirements of rushing often
find their health impaired. There
is also a financial burden. The av
erage sorority member contributes
seventeen dollars for each rushing
season — even with the simplest
standards of entertaihment that
Pan-Hellenic can devise.
During this time of highly or
ganized entertaining, the sorority
women must be selecting the
"class." This is an extremely diffi
cult task; for unless the sorority is
a distinct type, there must inevi
tably be differences of opinion in
this selection. Many unfortunate
incidents occur, such as angry dis
agreements between sorority mem
bers, the disappointment of the
sorority member whose freshman
friend is "dinged"' by her sorority,
the interference of alumnae who
insist upon the sorority's taking a
certain freshman that the sorority
does not want, and so on.
But the really insidious thing
about rushing is that it is not con
fined to the period of entertainment
—it is going on all the time. Dur
ing the summer, the sorority women
are busy getting acquainted with,
if not actually rushing, the enter
ing women near their homes. Dur
ing fall quarter they are careful to
make a good impression on the
freshmen, and upon those who j
might influence them. The sorority |
women are expected to learn the
names of as many freshmen as
they can, and to cultivate the ac- !
quaintance of any who are likely !
to be rushees. This was reasonably
possible when there were fewer j
than a hundred freshmen, but with J
over two hundred it becomes an |
almost hopeless task.
2. Hardships to special groups of
women
The cruel discrimination against
some girls is unjustifiable, and in !
an educational institution of today
almost unbelievable. Certain girls
often come to college unaware that !
they are not eligible for rushing, j
because of a circumstance which is i
completely beyond their control.
There are legacies who do not
happen to be just the sort of girl
the house wants. They are keenly i
disappointed if they are not bid, '
but they are in a much worse posi
tion when they are. And legacies
who do happen to be just the sort •
of girl the house wants often won- 1
der whether they were bid only
because of their connections.
Transfers who have previously af
filiated with a national sorority
having a local chapter are in much
the same situation, with the added
condition of almost irrevocable
membership in a distant chapter 1
that prevents them from joining a
congenial group on this campus.
Transfers who have previously af
filiated with a national sorority not
having a local chapter are deprived
even of that one chance to join a
congenial group. Even transfers
who have not previously affiliated
with a national sorority are at a
great disadvantage, because the '
sororities prefer to pledge fresh
men. Since the number of trans
fers is increasing from year to year,
their predicament is a growing
problem.
New women who are lacking in
the social graces — the very ones j
who would benefit most by the i
training a sorority provides — are J
the ones most often overlooked in
rushing. A sorority is not a welfare
bureau; it cannot afford to take
girls who are socially backward. As
a result, these girls are made to
feel their social inferiority even
more, and this reaction impedes 1
their normal social development. It
seems hardly fair that an educa- '
tional institution, suposedly de
signed to develop the fullest capa- j

cities of all the students, should
give them a rating at the beginning
of their callege career that is so
categorical.
:j. Over-emphasis of the social
For a sorority to maintain its
position of social prestige on the'
campus, it is necessary that it stress '
rather trivial superficialities —at the j
expense of the more fundamental
aims of college life. A sorority must I
make a good appearance before the;
campus in general, and the new
women in particular. The group
interest of the sorority is focused on
"getting a class." With the energy
of the group directed at this goal,
the real purposes of college are ob
scured. And this perversion of val
ues affects not only the sorority
women but also others who, being
impressed by the social prestige of
the sorority women, follow the ex
ample that they set.
4. Limitation of associations
It is essentially true that a soro
rity limits the friendships of its
members. While it is obvious that j
I here can be, and sometimes are, j
close friendships between members j
of different houses, or between Row |
women and Hall women, still it is I
apparent that the bulk of close |
friendships are formed within a 1
house. This is only a natural result
of the fact that a girl chooses her ,
friends from among those who are !
most often with her. A freshman i
girl, at an extremely plastic and !
formative age, is asked to select— j
on such an unnatural basis as rush- j
ing parties—one group with whom !
she will live during the remainder |
of her college life.
A college includes many varied
types of girls, and each girl should i
be able to choose her friends from :
all types with equal freedom. Dur
ing her four years of college she •
should be able to select her friends '
without the influence of sorority j
grouping.
5. Hindrance to the social-educative
program of the University
An individual sorority house, be
cause it is a part of a national or- '
ganization, cannot be an integral ,
part of the University residence
system. When a disciplinary case \
arises in a sorority, that sorority is
likely to depend upon the authority ;
of the national organization to
which it belongs, instead of sub- j
mitting the case to A.W.S. officials. |
These sororities, then, practice a
sort of extra-legal autonomy; and
under these circumstances it is im
possible for A.W.S. officials to main- !
tain a uniform enforcement of so- |

cial regulations.
Because the individual sorority
must compete with other sororities
in the race for prestige, a sorority
is obliged to keep its problems se
cret. Without this factor, the so
rorities could benefit by an inter
change of suggestions.
The work of the University in
creating a spirit of citizenship in
the freshman dormitory has been
impeded by the pledging and initia
tion of freshmen. These freshmen
give their first consideration to the
sorority and lose interest in the
affairs of the dormitory.
The work of the University in
character building has been mate
rially hindered by the division of
women into the groups, selected and
unselected. It is detrimental to a
student's emotional adjustment to
have a consciousness either of su
periority or inferiority, to have the
complacency of smugness, or Ihe
bitterness of social bewilderment.
(5. Artificial grouping
The presence of sororities on the
campus creates two distinct classes
—Row and Hall. Until this i year
those groups have been approxi
mately equal in number. Next year
there will be about 27 per cent Row
and 73 per cent Hall. In the very
restriction of proportionate num
bers the Row will become more se
lective, more exclusive, and more
enviable. This situation will pro
duce a breach between the two
groups that will hinder the tradi
tional spirit of Stanford democracy.
The sorority system does not ex
press the spirit of the present; it is
a system that looks to the past for
its excuse for being and the pattern
of its form.

regular academic work as well as
the requirements of rushing often
find their health impaired. There
is also a financial burden. The av
erage sorority member contributes
seventeen dollars for each rushing
season — even with the simplest
standards of entertaihment that
Pan-Hellenic can devise.
During this time of highly or
ganized entertaining, the sorority
women must be selecting the
"class." This is an extremely diffi
cult task; for unless the sorority is
a distinct type, there must inevi
tably be differences of opinion in
this selection. Many unfortunate
incidents occur, such as angry dis
agreements between sorority mem
bers, the disappointment of the
sorority member whose freshman
friend is "dinged"' by her sorority,
the interference of alumnae who
insist upon the sorority's taking a
certain freshman that the sorority
does not want, and so on.
But the really insidious thing
about rushing is that it is not con
fined to the period of entertainment
—it is going on all the time. Dur
ing the summer, the sorority women
are busy getting acquainted with,
if not actually rushing, the enter
ing women near their homes. Dur
ing fall quarter they are careful to
make a good impression on the
freshmen, and upon those who j
might influence them. The sorority |
women are expected to learn the
names of as many freshmen as
they can, and to cultivate the ac- !
quaintance of any who are likely !
to be rushees. This was reasonably
possible when there were fewer j
than a hundred freshmen, but with J
over two hundred it becomes an |
almost hopeless task.
2. Hardships to special groups of
women
The cruel discrimination against
some girls is unjustifiable, and in !
an educational institution of today
almost unbelievable. Certain girls
often come to college unaware that !
they are not eligible for rushing, j
because of a circumstance which is i
completely beyond their control.
There are legacies who do not
happen to be just the sort of girl
the house wants. They are keenly i
disappointed if they are not bid, '
but they are in a much worse posi
tion when they are. And legacies
who do happen to be just the sort •
of girl the house wants often won- 1
der whether they were bid only
because of their connections.
Transfers who have previously af
filiated with a national sorority
having a local chapter are in much
the same situation, with the added
condition of almost irrevocable
membership in a distant chapter 1
that prevents them from joining a
congenial group on this campus.
Transfers who have previously af
filiated with a national sorority not
having a local chapter are deprived
even of that one chance to join a
congenial group. Even transfers
who have not previously affiliated
with a national sorority are at a
great disadvantage, because the '
sororities prefer to pledge fresh
men. Since the number of trans
fers is increasing from year to year,
their predicament is a growing
problem.
New women who are lacking in
the social graces — the very ones j
who would benefit most by the i
training a sorority provides — are J
the ones most often overlooked in
rushing. A sorority is not a welfare
bureau; it cannot afford to take
girls who are socially backward. As
a result, these girls are made to
feel their social inferiority even
more, and this reaction impedes 1
their normal social development. It
seems hardly fair that an educa- '
tional institution, suposedly de
signed to develop the fullest capa- j

cities of all the students, should
give them a rating at the beginning
of their callege career that is so
categorical.
:j. Over-emphasis of the social
For a sorority to maintain its
position of social prestige on the'
campus, it is necessary that it stress '
rather trivial superficialities —at the j
expense of the more fundamental
aims of college life. A sorority must I
make a good appearance before the;
campus in general, and the new
women in particular. The group
interest of the sorority is focused on
"getting a class." With the energy
of the group directed at this goal,
the real purposes of college are ob
scured. And this perversion of val
ues affects not only the sorority
women but also others who, being
impressed by the social prestige of
the sorority women, follow the ex
ample that they set.
4. Limitation of associations
It is essentially true that a soro
rity limits the friendships of its
members. While it is obvious that j
I here can be, and sometimes are, j
close friendships between members j
of different houses, or between Row |
women and Hall women, still it is I
apparent that the bulk of close |
friendships are formed within a 1
house. This is only a natural result
of the fact that a girl chooses her ,
friends from among those who are !
most often with her. A freshman i
girl, at an extremely plastic and !
formative age, is asked to select— j
on such an unnatural basis as rush- j
ing parties—one group with whom !
she will live during the remainder |
of her college life.
A college includes many varied
types of girls, and each girl should i
be able to choose her friends from :
all types with equal freedom. Dur
ing her four years of college she •
should be able to select her friends '
without the influence of sorority j
grouping.
5. Hindrance to the social-educative
program of the University
An individual sorority house, be
cause it is a part of a national or- '
ganization, cannot be an integral ,
part of the University residence
system. When a disciplinary case \
arises in a sorority, that sorority is
likely to depend upon the authority ;
of the national organization to
which it belongs, instead of sub- j
mitting the case to A.W.S. officials. |
These sororities, then, practice a
sort of extra-legal autonomy; and
under these circumstances it is im
possible for A.W.S. officials to main- !
tain a uniform enforcement of so- |

cial regulations.
Because the individual sorority
must compete with other sororities
in the race for prestige, a sorority
is obliged to keep its problems se
cret. Without this factor, the so
rorities could benefit by an inter
change of suggestions.
The work of the University in
creating a spirit of citizenship in
the freshman dormitory has been
impeded by the pledging and initia
tion of freshmen. These freshmen
give their first consideration to the
sorority and lose interest in the
affairs of the dormitory.
The work of the University in
character building has been mate
rially hindered by the division of
women into the groups, selected and
unselected. It is detrimental to a
student's emotional adjustment to
have a consciousness either of su
periority or inferiority, to have the
complacency of smugness, or Ihe
bitterness of social bewilderment.
(5. Artificial grouping
The presence of sororities on the
campus creates two distinct classes
—Row and Hall. Until this i year
those groups have been approxi
mately equal in number. Next year
there will be about 27 per cent Row
and 73 per cent Hall. In the very
restriction of proportionate num
bers the Row will become more se
lective, more exclusive, and more
enviable. This situation will pro
duce a breach between the two
groups that will hinder the tradi
tional spirit of Stanford democracy.
The sorority system does not ex
press the spirit of the present; it is
a system that looks to the past for
its excuse for being and the pattern
of its form.
7. Rushing (its effects and condi
tions as taken primarily from
Roblc this year).
Any person living in Roble dur
ing the last rushing period and who
was in a position to know what was
happening can describe it as nothing
less than completely emotional.
Even to an old girl, who was less
affected than any other member in
the hall, the high state of nervous
tension was apparent.
There is no question that during
this time studying was neglected
and| the regular routine entirely
disrupted. Bull sessions at all hours,
disregard for all quiet hours, and
continuous speculation and thought
on one subject reversed the condi
tions of ordinary living. The sense
of balance and values was com
pletely distorted.
These were outward manifesta
tions of what was happening; they
would have been apparent even to
a visitor. However, to realize the
effects and the far-reaching results
of the rushing system one must
come to concrete, individual cases.
There was not a new girl in Ro
ble who was not in some way af
fected. It was the culmination of
intimations and whisperings and
inferences which had surounded her
all fall quarter. With the lifting of
the taboo, she could talk openly
about what every girl had thought
of for three months. The mere
rules of the relations of row and
new women during the fall quarter
had over-emphasized the impor
tance of the problem.
It would probably be unfair to
say that new women choose their
friends with an eye to their house
connections or possibilities. But. it
is admitted that, consciously or not,
this does influence their estimation
and evaluation of the girls with
whom they are living.
In the following list of effects and
results of rushing, an attempt has

been made to give representative
examples which will give a pic- ;
ture of the whole.
1. This year there were girls who
received no invitations at all, or
only one or two. The first reaction
in that, case was to build up a de- '
fense, to show everyone else that
they didn't care. But in reality,
there was a turn to self-analysis,
to ask the question, "What is the
matter with me?"
2. In direct contrast with these ;
girls were those who had to do the i
eliminating instead of the houses.
Their mixed feelings of exultation :
and elation were often unfounded.
Disappointments later in the week
were harder than they would have
been in the beginning.
But all of these girls were not
disappointed, and uncertain though
they were, they were already
stamped with a superiority which
is never mentioned but often felt. |
Under this grouping also comes i
the girl who couldn't decide, even 1
up to pledge night. Her own state
of emotion and the effect of it on
others is difficult to estimate, but
certainly far-reaching.
3. There were many who were not
rushed by the house which they
wanted, and so refused all invita
tions with fatal resignation. Their
decision was complete. The major
ity of these girls will probably be
very happy in dormitories, but
their adjustment to college life in a
hall in contrast to their plan for it
in a sorority will not be immediate.
And it will take more than a few
months before they will be able to
have an unprejudiced attitude to
ward the girls in the house which
did not take them.
4. There are always those who
join a house for the sole sake of j
going vow. The unhappiness of
these girls while making a decision
is only the beginning of three years'
unhappiness in a second - choice
group. 4
If more detailed cases were given,
as they could be, the illustrations
would show unpleasantness and in
justice.
To see truly what happens dur
ing a rushing season, to conceive
its immediate and ultimate effects
as they have been this year and as
they will be next year, is to be
convinced that in them alone is jus
tification for the abolition of the
sorority system.
Tine culmination of more than
two months' investigation of the
Stanford sorority system by the
A.W.S. commission organized for
this purpose comes in the report j
printed below. This report is not j
an affair brought up by the ad- ,
ministration. It was initiated by j
students; the work on it was done j
by students; and the final judgment
of it will be up to the students, ac- !
cording to the commission.
The commission has endeavored
to present a fair, unbiased consid
eration of the matter and will put i
the question to the rest of the cam- '
pus next week.
PREFACE
A.W.S. Sorority Commission Report
The A.W.S. sorority commission, '
representing all groups of the campus ;
for the purpose of impartial investi
gation and discussion of the so- |
rority system. The results were to j
be tabulated in a single report.
This was not possible. The only
method of procedure which the
commission could take was to have j
one group present disadvantages, j
the other advantages.
As it is submitted, the report is
in two parts. Each part was written j
by a group of volunteers who j
wanted to present one side. The i
result is a report of two expressions j
of opinion. No statement on the
list either of assets or liabilities is j
to be construed as representative
of a conclusion reached by the ;
whole commission.
ADVANTAGES
1. People love organizations. Like i
will flock together in clubs. It is
better to have organized fraternity |
groups under control than miscel
laneous independent clubs. Snob
bishness exists in social cliques i
more intensively than in fraterni
ties and has no tangible center in
the latter which can be attached. |
2. The fraternity fosters friend- i
ships. One can be friends only with
a limited number. There are dan- '
gers of forgetting college's oppor
tunity for friendship if one tries to '
know equally well all of a large '
student body.
3. The fraternity brings together
girls of varied tastes and activities
so Ihat it is broader than a de
partment club. Fraternity encour- '
ages the appreciation of all lines of
scholarship and forms bonds of con
geniality bigger than the interest
in one's individual affairs or that i
found in social cliques based on the '
Similarity of interests.
4. The fraternity stands for the
best college ideals. It is a group
unit through which it is easy to
reach and influence individual stu
dents. Its close relationships make
possible a stronger influence on the
individual than faculty or dormi
tory alone can have. As a group a
chapter can more effectively for
ward college activities than can
girls working individually.
5. The national charter in a fra
rnity broadens the viewpoint be
cause of its interest in and appre
ciation for other colegcs. Thereby
it counteracts the prevailing pro
vincialism and egotism of most
campuses. This contact with other
colleges gives the fraternity woman
contact and a possibility for friend
-1 lip throughout the country.
6. The fraternity holds the inter
est of alutnnae and keeps them in
touch v/ith college, its work and
its needs, and brings them back for
visits.
7. The fraternity stands for high
scholarship and helps members to
('') good consistent work. For these
reasons study tables have been es
tablished in the houses and a grade
rating set up to be met by pros
pective members.
6. The fraternity recognizes that
intellectual pursuits are not the
only thing necessary to develop
womanly citizens. r rhe size of stu
dent bodies and modern educational
methods make it impossible for a
college to do much for students
outside the class room. Fraternities
give members the development and
training found in the cohesive or
ganization of an Oxford college.
Through chapter social activities
id support of college enterprises,
fraternities extend in a measure this
same sort of help to the rest of
the student body.
9. Close friendships and a com
munity of interests in a chapter de
velop unselfishness, adaptability, co
operation, tact, honor, and in it ia
i ve. In the student body many a
student's talent atrophies and her
initiative power remains undevel
oped because there are no demands
for its exercise upon every student,
while in a fraternity each girl mem
ber must carry her share of work,
activity, and responsibility.
10. As part of a national organi
zation with high ideals a chapter
must strive to represent its fra
ternity well. It is constantly urged
to appreciate its duty as an orga
nized member of the community.
This, with the chapter's opportuni
ties for service and hospitality to
students and friends, encourages in
vvery member tolerance, generosity,
a sense of personal responsibility,
thoughtfulness, consideration for
others, and interest in a world be
yond one's own door.
11. Chapter fellowship gives
pleasure to individuals and encour
ages each one to make the most of
./ne's self without forgetting one's
obligations not to advance at the
expense of others. Growth comes
through pleasure as well as through
work, so this companionship means
much at the time.
12. Chapter life with its duties
and responsibility more nearly ap
roaches home life than does any
dormitory plan.
13. The test of college organiza
tion is: does it advance or hinder
ihe real object of college? Does it
make for higher or lower scholar
ship? Investigations and reports on
universities commend fraternity
bapters for help along both these
Jines.
14. Fraternities give pleasure to
members, college and alumnae. In
zeal for the good of the whole, one
group should not be denied the
right of its own happiness. <
15. The fraternity has become
nore of a living group than a se
cret society, for it is recognized that
all are based upon the identical
principles of truth, honor, friend
ship, and loyalty. The difference
among the fraternities is merely in
the varied manner or procedure of
initiation ceremonies, in order to
impress their members with the
.significance of these ideals.
Hi. The process of selecting new
members for (he fraternity is one
open 1o change and is an existing
evil which can be minimized or
completely eliminated by a com
mon sense revision of the present
rushing system and rules. Many
J: the objections to the fraternity
system are objections merely to the
existing rushing system found at
Stanford rather than inherent dis
advantages of the fraternity itself.
And we feel that the time could be
more profitably spent in formulat
ing a plan for the reorganization
t rushing rather than the abolition
of sororities.

DISADVANTAGES
1. The burden of rushing on the
sorority women
The intensive effort required for
a successful season of rushing can
not help taking its toll from the
sorority women. The weeks of ac
tual rushing demand a great deal of
time and energy. It is well known
that scholarship takes a drop dur
ing this period; and women who
try to meet the requirements of
regular academic work as well as
the requirements of rushing often
find their health impaired. There
is also a financial burden. The av
erage sorority member contributes
seventeen dollars for each rushing
season — even with the simplest
standards of entertaihment that
Pan-Hellenic can devise.

whole commission.
ADVANTAGES
1. People love organizations. Like i
will flock together in clubs. It is
better to have organized fraternity |
groups under control than miscel
laneous independent clubs. Snob
bishness exists in social cliques i
more intensively than in fraterni
ties and has no tangible center in
the latter which can be attached. |
2. The fraternity fosters friend- i
ships. One can be friends only with
a limited number. There are dan- '
gers of forgetting college's oppor
tunity for friendship if one tries to '
know equally well all of a large '
student body.
3. The fraternity brings together
girls of varied tastes and activities
so Ihat it is broader than a de
partment club. Fraternity encour- '
ages the appreciation of all lines of
scholarship and forms bonds of con
geniality bigger than the interest
in one's individual affairs or that i
found in social cliques based on the '
Similarity of interests.
4. The fraternity stands for the
best college ideals. It is a group
unit through which it is easy to
reach and influence individual stu
dents. Its close relationships make
possible a stronger influence on the
individual than faculty or dormi
tory alone can have. As a group a
chapter can more effectively for
ward college activities than can
girls working individually.
5. The national charter in a fra
rnity broadens the viewpoint be
cause of its interest in and appre
ciation for other colegcs. Thereby
it counteracts the prevailing pro
vincialism and egotism of most
campuses. This contact with other
colleges gives the fraternity woman
contact and a possibility for friend
-1 lip throughout the country.
6. The fraternity holds the inter
est of alutnnae and keeps them in
touch v/ith college, its work and
its needs, and brings them back for
visits.
7. The fraternity stands for high
scholarship and helps members to
('') good consistent work. For these
reasons study tables have been es
tablished in the houses and a grade
rating set up to be met by pros
pective members.
6. The fraternity recognizes that
intellectual pursuits are not the
only thing necessary to develop
womanly citizens. r rhe size of stu
dent bodies and modern educational
methods make it impossible for a
college to do much for students
outside the class room. Fraternities
give members the development and
training found in the cohesive or
ganization of an Oxford college.
Through chapter social activities
id support of college enterprises,
fraternities extend in a measure this
same sort of help to the rest of
the student body.
9. Close friendships and a com
munity of interests in a chapter de
velop unselfishness, adaptability, co
operation, tact, honor, and in it ia
i ve. In the student body many a
student's talent atrophies and her
initiative power remains undevel
oped because there are no demands
for its exercise upon every student,
while in a fraternity each girl mem
ber must carry her share of work,
activity, and responsibility.
10. As part of a national organi
zation with high ideals a chapter
must strive to represent its fra
ternity well. It is constantly urged
to appreciate its duty as an orga
nized member of the community.
This, with the chapter's opportuni
ties for service and hospitality to
students and friends, encourages in
vvery member tolerance, generosity,
a sense of personal responsibility,
thoughtfulness, consideration for
others, and interest in a world be
yond one's own door.
11. Chapter fellowship gives
pleasure to individuals and encour
ages each one to make the most of
./ne's self without forgetting one's
obligations not to advance at the
expense of others. Growth comes
through pleasure as well as through
work, so this companionship means
much at the time.
12. Chapter life with its duties
and responsibility more nearly ap
roaches home life than does any
dormitory plan.
13. The test of college organiza
tion is: does it advance or hinder
ihe real object of college? Does it
make for higher or lower scholar
ship? Investigations and reports on
universities commend fraternity
bapters for help along both these
Jines.
14. Fraternities give pleasure to
members, college and alumnae. In
zeal for the good of the whole, one
group should not be denied the
right of its own happiness. <
15. The fraternity has become
nore of a living group than a se
cret society, for it is recognized that
all are based upon the identical
principles of truth, honor, friend
ship, and loyalty. The difference
among the fraternities is merely in
the varied manner or procedure of
initiation ceremonies, in order to
impress their members with the
.significance of these ideals.
Hi. The process of selecting new
members for (he fraternity is one
open 1o change and is an existing
evil which can be minimized or
completely eliminated by a com
mon sense revision of the present
rushing system and rules. Many
J: the objections to the fraternity
system are objections merely to the
existing rushing system found at
Stanford rather than inherent dis
advantages of the fraternity itself.
And we feel that the time could be
more profitably spent in formulat
ing a plan for the reorganization
t rushing rather than the abolition
of sororities.

DISADVANTAGES
1. The burden of rushing on the
sorority women
The intensive effort required for
a successful season of rushing can
not help taking its toll from the
sorority women. The weeks of ac
tual rushing demand a great deal of
time and energy. It is well known
that scholarship takes a drop dur
ing this period; and women who
try to meet the requirements of
regular academic work as well as
the requirements of rushing often
find their health impaired. There
is also a financial burden. The av
erage sorority member contributes
seventeen dollars for each rushing
season — even with the simplest
standards of entertaihment that
Pan-Hellenic can devise.
During this time of highly or
ganized entertaining, the sorority
women must be selecting the
"class." This is an extremely diffi
cult task; for unless the sorority is
a distinct type, there must inevi
tably be differences of opinion in
this selection. Many unfortunate
incidents occur, such as angry dis
agreements between sorority mem
bers, the disappointment of the
sorority member whose freshman
friend is "dinged"' by her sorority,
the interference of alumnae who
insist upon the sorority's taking a
certain freshman that the sorority
does not want, and so on.
But the really insidious thing
about rushing is that it is not con
fined to the period of entertainment
—it is going on all the time. Dur
ing the summer, the sorority women
are busy getting acquainted with,
if not actually rushing, the enter
ing women near their homes. Dur
ing fall quarter they are careful to
make a good impression on the
freshmen, and upon those who j
might influence them. The sorority |
women are expected to learn the
names of as many freshmen as
they can, and to cultivate the ac- !
quaintance of any who are likely !
to be rushees. This was reasonably
possible when there were fewer j
than a hundred freshmen, but with J
over two hundred it becomes an |
almost hopeless task.
2. Hardships to special groups of
women
The cruel discrimination against
some girls is unjustifiable, and in !
an educational institution of today
almost unbelievable. Certain girls
often come to college unaware that !
they are not eligible for rushing, j
because of a circumstance which is i
completely beyond their control.
There are legacies who do not
happen to be just the sort of girl
the house wants. They are keenly i
disappointed if they are not bid, '
but they are in a much worse posi
tion when they are. And legacies
who do happen to be just the sort •
of girl the house wants often won- 1
der whether they were bid only
because of their connections.
Transfers who have previously af
filiated with a national sorority
having a local chapter are in much
the same situation, with the added
condition of almost irrevocable
membership in a distant chapter 1
that prevents them from joining a
congenial group on this campus.
Transfers who have previously af
filiated with a national sorority not
having a local chapter are deprived
even of that one chance to join a
congenial group. Even transfers
who have not previously affiliated
with a national sorority are at a
great disadvantage, because the '
sororities prefer to pledge fresh
men. Since the number of trans
fers is increasing from year to year,
their predicament is a growing
problem.
New women who are lacking in
the social graces — the very ones j
who would benefit most by the i
training a sorority provides — are J
the ones most often overlooked in
rushing. A sorority is not a welfare
bureau; it cannot afford to take
girls who are socially backward. As
a result, these girls are made to
feel their social inferiority even
more, and this reaction impedes 1
their normal social development. It
seems hardly fair that an educa- '
tional institution, suposedly de
signed to develop the fullest capa- j

cities of all the students, should
give them a rating at the beginning
of their callege career that is so
categorical.
:j. Over-emphasis of the social
For a sorority to maintain its
position of social prestige on the'
campus, it is necessary that it stress '
rather trivial superficialities —at the j
expense of the more fundamental
aims of college life. A sorority must I
make a good appearance before the;
campus in general, and the new
women in particular. The group
interest of the sorority is focused on
"getting a class." With the energy
of the group directed at this goal,
the real purposes of college are ob
scured. And this perversion of val
ues affects not only the sorority
women but also others who, being
impressed by the social prestige of
the sorority women, follow the ex
ample that they set.
4. Limitation of associations
It is essentially true that a soro
rity limits the friendships of its
members. While it is obvious that j
I here can be, and sometimes are, j
close friendships between members j
of different houses, or between Row |
women and Hall women, still it is I
apparent that the bulk of close |
friendships are formed within a 1
house. This is only a natural result
of the fact that a girl chooses her ,
friends from among those who are !
most often with her. A freshman i
girl, at an extremely plastic and !
formative age, is asked to select— j
on such an unnatural basis as rush- j
ing parties—one group with whom !
she will live during the remainder |
of her college life.
A college includes many varied
types of girls, and each girl should i
be able to choose her friends from :
all types with equal freedom. Dur
ing her four years of college she •
should be able to select her friends '
without the influence of sorority j
grouping.
5. Hindrance to the social-educative
program of the University
An individual sorority house, be
cause it is a part of a national or- '
ganization, cannot be an integral ,
part of the University residence
system. When a disciplinary case \
arises in a sorority, that sorority is
likely to depend upon the authority ;
of the national organization to
which it belongs, instead of sub- j
mitting the case to A.W.S. officials. |
These sororities, then, practice a
sort of extra-legal autonomy; and
under these circumstances it is im
possible for A.W.S. officials to main- !
tain a uniform enforcement of so- |

cial regulations.
Because the individual sorority
must compete with other sororities
in the race for prestige, a sorority
is obliged to keep its problems se
cret. Without this factor, the so
rorities could benefit by an inter
change of suggestions.
The work of the University in
creating a spirit of citizenship in
the freshman dormitory has been
impeded by the pledging and initia
tion of freshmen. These freshmen
give their first consideration to the
sorority and lose interest in the
affairs of the dormitory.
The work of the University in
character building has been mate
rially hindered by the division of
women into the groups, selected and
unselected. It is detrimental to a
student's emotional adjustment to
have a consciousness either of su
periority or inferiority, to have the
complacency of smugness, or Ihe
bitterness of social bewilderment.
(5. Artificial grouping
The presence of sororities on the
campus creates two distinct classes
—Row and Hall. Until this i year
those groups have been approxi
mately equal in number. Next year
there will be about 27 per cent Row
and 73 per cent Hall. In the very
restriction of proportionate num
bers the Row will become more se
lective, more exclusive, and more
enviable. This situation will pro
duce a breach between the two
groups that will hinder the tradi
tional spirit of Stanford democracy.
The sorority system does not ex
press the spirit of the present; it is
a system that looks to the past for
its excuse for being and the pattern
of its form.
7. Rushing (its effects and condi
tions as taken primarily from
Roblc this year).
Any person living in Roble dur
ing the last rushing period and who
was in a position to know what was
happening can describe it as nothing
less than completely emotional.
Even to an old girl, who was less
affected than any other member in
the hall, the high state of nervous
tension was apparent.
There is no question that during
this time studying was neglected
and| the regular routine entirely
disrupted. Bull sessions at all hours,
disregard for all quiet hours, and
continuous speculation and thought
on one subject reversed the condi
tions of ordinary living. The sense
of balance and values was com
pletely distorted.
These were outward manifesta
tions of what was happening; they
would have been apparent even to
a visitor. However, to realize the
effects and the far-reaching results
of the rushing system one must
come to concrete, individual cases.
There was not a new girl in Ro
ble who was not in some way af
fected. It was the culmination of
intimations and whisperings and
inferences which had surounded her
all fall quarter. With the lifting of
the taboo, she could talk openly
about what every girl had thought
of for three months. The mere
rules of the relations of row and
new women during the fall quarter
had over-emphasized the impor
tance of the problem.
It would probably be unfair to
say that new women choose their
friends with an eye to their house
connections or possibilities. But. it
is admitted that, consciously or not,
this does influence their estimation
and evaluation of the girls with
whom they are living.
In the following list of effects and
results of rushing, an attempt has

been made to give representative
examples which will give a pic- ;
ture of the whole.
1. This year there were girls who
received no invitations at all, or
only one or two. The first reaction
in that, case was to build up a de- '
fense, to show everyone else that
they didn't care. But in reality,
there was a turn to self-analysis,
to ask the question, "What is the
matter with me?"
2. In direct contrast with these ;
girls were those who had to do the i
eliminating instead of the houses.
Their mixed feelings of exultation :
and elation were often unfounded.
Disappointments later in the week
were harder than they would have
been in the beginning.
But all of these girls were not
disappointed, and uncertain though
they were, they were already
stamped with a superiority which
is never mentioned but often felt. |
Under this grouping also comes i
the girl who couldn't decide, even 1
up to pledge night. Her own state
of emotion and the effect of it on
others is difficult to estimate, but
certainly far-reaching.
3. There were many who were not
rushed by the house which they
wanted, and so refused all invita
tions with fatal resignation. Their
decision was complete. The major
ity of these girls will probably be
very happy in dormitories, but
their adjustment to college life in a
hall in contrast to their plan for it
in a sorority will not be immediate.
And it will take more than a few
months before they will be able to
have an unprejudiced attitude to
ward the girls in the house which
did not take them.
4. There are always those who
join a house for the sole sake of j
going vow. The unhappiness of
these girls while making a decision
is only the beginning of three years'
unhappiness in a second - choice
group. 4
If more detailed cases were given,
as they could be, the illustrations
would show unpleasantness and in
justice.
To see truly what happens dur
ing a rushing season, to conceive
its immediate and ultimate effects
as they have been this year and as
they will be next year, is to be
convinced that in them alone is jus
tification for the abolition of the
sorority system.
Tine culmination of more than
two months' investigation of the
Stanford sorority system by the
A.W.S. commission organized for
this purpose comes in the report j
printed below. This report is not j
an affair brought up by the ad- ,
ministration. It was initiated by j
students; the work on it was done j
by students; and the final judgment
of it will be up to the students, ac- !
cording to the commission.
The commission has endeavored
to present a fair, unbiased consid
eration of the matter and will put i
the question to the rest of the cam- '
pus next week.
PREFACE
A.W.S. Sorority Commission Report
The A.W.S. sorority commission, '
representing all groups of the campus ;
for the purpose of impartial investi
gation and discussion of the so- |
rority system. The results were to j
be tabulated in a single report.
This was not possible. The only
method of procedure which the
commission could take was to have j
one group present disadvantages, j
the other advantages.
As it is submitted, the report is
in two parts. Each part was written j
by a group of volunteers who j
wanted to present one side. The i
result is a report of two expressions j
of opinion. No statement on the
list either of assets or liabilities is j
to be construed as representative
of a conclusion reached by the ;
whole commission.

and 73 per cent Hall. In the very
restriction of proportionate num
bers the Row will become more se
lective, more exclusive, and more
enviable. This situation will pro
duce a breach between the two
groups that will hinder the tradi
tional spirit of Stanford democracy.
The sorority system does not ex
press the spirit of the present; it is
a system that looks to the past for
its excuse for being and the pattern
of its form.
7. Rushing (its effects and condi
tions as taken primarily from
Roblc this year).
Any person living in Roble dur
ing the last rushing period and who
was in a position to know what was
happening can describe it as nothing
less than completely emotional.
Even to an old girl, who was less
affected than any other member in
the hall, the high state of nervous
tension was apparent.
There is no question that during
this time studying was neglected
and| the regular routine entirely
disrupted. Bull sessions at all hours,
disregard for all quiet hours, and
continuous speculation and thought
on one subject reversed the condi
tions of ordinary living. The sense
of balance and values was com
pletely distorted.
These were outward manifesta
tions of what was happening; they
would have been apparent even to
a visitor. However, to realize the
effects and the far-reaching results
of the rushing system one must
come to concrete, individual cases.
There was not a new girl in Ro
ble who was not in some way af
fected. It was the culmination of
intimations and whisperings and
inferences which had surounded her
all fall quarter. With the lifting of
the taboo, she could talk openly
about what every girl had thought
of for three months. The mere
rules of the relations of row and
new women during the fall quarter
had over-emphasized the impor
tance of the problem.
It would probably be unfair to
say that new women choose their
friends with an eye to their house
connections or possibilities. But. it
is admitted that, consciously or not,
this does influence their estimation
and evaluation of the girls with
whom they are living.
In the following list of effects and
results of rushing, an attempt has

been made to give representative
examples which will give a pic- ;
ture of the whole.
1. This year there were girls who
received no invitations at all, or
only one or two. The first reaction
in that, case was to build up a de- '
fense, to show everyone else that
they didn't care. But in reality,
there was a turn to self-analysis,
to ask the question, "What is the
matter with me?"
2. In direct contrast with these ;
girls were those who had to do the i
eliminating instead of the houses.
Their mixed feelings of exultation :
and elation were often unfounded.
Disappointments later in the week
were harder than they would have
been in the beginning.
But all of these girls were not
disappointed, and uncertain though
they were, they were already
stamped with a superiority which
is never mentioned but often felt. |
Under this grouping also comes i
the girl who couldn't decide, even 1
up to pledge night. Her own state
of emotion and the effect of it on
others is difficult to estimate, but
certainly far-reaching.
3. There were many who were not
rushed by the house which they
wanted, and so refused all invita
tions with fatal resignation. Their
decision was complete. The major
ity of these girls will probably be
very happy in dormitories, but
their adjustment to college life in a
hall in contrast to their plan for it
in a sorority will not be immediate.
And it will take more than a few
months before they will be able to
have an unprejudiced attitude to
ward the girls in the house which
did not take them.
4. There are always those who
join a house for the sole sake of j
going vow. The unhappiness of
these girls while making a decision
is only the beginning of three years'
unhappiness in a second - choice
group. 4
If more detailed cases were given,
as they could be, the illustrations
would show unpleasantness and in
justice.
To see truly what happens dur
ing a rushing season, to conceive
its immediate and ultimate effects
as they have been this year and as
they will be next year, is to be
convinced that in them alone is jus
tification for the abolition of the
sorority system.
Tine culmination of more than
two months' investigation of the
Stanford sorority system by the
A.W.S. commission organized for
this purpose comes in the report j
printed below. This report is not j
an affair brought up by the ad- ,
ministration. It was initiated by j
students; the work on it was done j
by students; and the final judgment
of it will be up to the students, ac- !
cording to the commission.
The commission has endeavored
to present a fair, unbiased consid
eration of the matter and will put i
the question to the rest of the cam- '
pus next week.
PREFACE
A.W.S. Sorority Commission Report
The A.W.S. sorority commission, '
representing all groups of the campus ;
for the purpose of impartial investi
gation and discussion of the so- |
rority system. The results were to j
be tabulated in a single report.
This was not possible. The only
method of procedure which the
commission could take was to have j
one group present disadvantages, j
the other advantages.
As it is submitted, the report is
in two parts. Each part was written j
by a group of volunteers who j
wanted to present one side. The i
result is a report of two expressions j
of opinion. No statement on the
list either of assets or liabilities is j
to be construed as representative
of a conclusion reached by the ;
whole commission.
ADVANTAGES
1. People love organizations. Like i
will flock together in clubs. It is
better to have organized fraternity |
groups under control than miscel
laneous independent clubs. Snob
bishness exists in social cliques i
more intensively than in fraterni
ties and has no tangible center in
the latter which can be attached. |
2. The fraternity fosters friend- i
ships. One can be friends only with
a limited number. There are dan- '
gers of forgetting college's oppor
tunity for friendship if one tries to '
know equally well all of a large '
student body.
3. The fraternity brings together
girls of varied tastes and activities
so Ihat it is broader than a de
partment club. Fraternity encour- '
ages the appreciation of all lines of
scholarship and forms bonds of con
geniality bigger than the interest
in one's individual affairs or that i
found in social cliques based on the '
Similarity of interests.
4. The fraternity stands for the
best college ideals. It is a group
unit through which it is easy to
reach and influence individual stu
dents. Its close relationships make
possible a stronger influence on the
individual than faculty or dormi
tory alone can have. As a group a
chapter can more effectively for
ward college activities than can
girls working individually.
5. The national charter in a fra
rnity broadens the viewpoint be
cause of its interest in and appre
ciation for other colegcs. Thereby
it counteracts the prevailing pro
vincialism and egotism of most
campuses. This contact with other
colleges gives the fraternity woman
contact and a possibility for friend
-1 lip throughout the country.
6. The fraternity holds the inter
est of alutnnae and keeps them in
touch v/ith college, its work and
its needs, and brings them back for
visits.
7. The fraternity stands for high
scholarship and helps members to
('') good consistent work. For these
reasons study tables have been es
tablished in the houses and a grade
rating set up to be met by pros
pective members.
6. The fraternity recognizes that
intellectual pursuits are not the
only thing necessary to develop
womanly citizens. r rhe size of stu
dent bodies and modern educational
methods make it impossible for a
college to do much for students
outside the class room. Fraternities
give members the development and
training found in the cohesive or
ganization of an Oxford college.
Through chapter social activities
id support of college enterprises,
fraternities extend in a measure this
same sort of help to the rest of
the student body.
9. Close friendships and a com
munity of interests in a chapter de
velop unselfishness, adaptability, co
operation, tact, honor, and in it ia
i ve. In the student body many a
student's talent atrophies and her
initiative power remains undevel
oped because there are no demands
for its exercise upon every student,
while in a fraternity each girl mem
ber must carry her share of work,
activity, and responsibility.
10. As part of a national organi
zation with high ideals a chapter
must strive to represent its fra
ternity well. It is constantly urged
to appreciate its duty as an orga
nized member of the community.
This, with the chapter's opportuni
ties for service and hospitality to
students and friends, encourages in
vvery member tolerance, generosity,
a sense of personal responsibility,
thoughtfulness, consideration for
others, and interest in a world be
yond one's own door.
11. Chapter fellowship gives
pleasure to individuals and encour
ages each one to make the most of
./ne's self without forgetting one's
obligations not to advance at the
expense of others. Growth comes
through pleasure as well as through
work, so this companionship means
much at the time.
12. Chapter life with its duties
and responsibility more nearly ap
roaches home life than does any
dormitory plan.
13. The test of college organiza
tion is: does it advance or hinder
ihe real object of college? Does it
make for higher or lower scholar
ship? Investigations and reports on
universities commend fraternity
bapters for help along both these
Jines.
14. Fraternities give pleasure to
members, college and alumnae. In
zeal for the good of the whole, one
group should not be denied the
right of its own happiness. <
15. The fraternity has become
nore of a living group than a se
cret society, for it is recognized that
all are based upon the identical
principles of truth, honor, friend
ship, and loyalty. The difference
among the fraternities is merely in
the varied manner or procedure of
initiation ceremonies, in order to
impress their members with the
.significance of these ideals.
Hi. The process of selecting new
members for (he fraternity is one
open 1o change and is an existing
evil which can be minimized or
completely eliminated by a com
mon sense revision of the present
rushing system and rules. Many
J: the objections to the fraternity
system are objections merely to the
existing rushing system found at
Stanford rather than inherent dis
advantages of the fraternity itself.
And we feel that the time could be
more profitably spent in formulat
ing a plan for the reorganization
t rushing rather than the abolition
of sororities.

DISADVANTAGES
1. The burden of rushing on the
sorority women
The intensive effort required for
a successful season of rushing can
not help taking its toll from the
sorority women. The weeks of ac
tual rushing demand a great deal of
time and energy. It is well known
that scholarship takes a drop dur
ing this period; and women who
try to meet the requirements of
regular academic work as well as
the requirements of rushing often
find their health impaired. There
is also a financial burden. The av
erage sorority member contributes
seventeen dollars for each rushing
season — even with the simplest
standards of entertaihment that
Pan-Hellenic can devise.
During this time of highly or
ganized entertaining, the sorority
women must be selecting the
"class." This is an extremely diffi
cult task; for unless the sorority is
a distinct type, there must inevi
tably be differences of opinion in
this selection. Many unfortunate
incidents occur, such as angry dis
agreements between sorority mem
bers, the disappointment of the
sorority member whose freshman
friend is "dinged"' by her sorority,
the interference of alumnae who
insist upon the sorority's taking a
certain freshman that the sorority
does not want, and so on.
But the really insidious thing
about rushing is that it is not con
fined to the period of entertainment
—it is going on all the time. Dur
ing the summer, the sorority women
are busy getting acquainted with,
if not actually rushing, the enter
ing women near their homes. Dur
ing fall quarter they are careful to
make a good impression on the
freshmen, and upon those who j
might influence them. The sorority |
women are expected to learn the
names of as many freshmen as
they can, and to cultivate the ac- !
quaintance of any who are likely !
to be rushees. This was reasonably
possible when there were fewer j
than a hundred freshmen, but with J
over two hundred it becomes an |
almost hopeless task.
2. Hardships to special groups of
women
The cruel discrimination against
some girls is unjustifiable, and in !
an educational institution of today
almost unbelievable. Certain girls
often come to college unaware that !
they are not eligible for rushing, j
because of a circumstance which is i
completely beyond their control.
There are legacies who do not
happen to be just the sort of girl
the house wants. They are keenly i
disappointed if they are not bid, '
but they are in a much worse posi
tion when they are. And legacies
who do happen to be just the sort •
of girl the house wants often won- 1
der whether they were bid only
because of their connections.
Transfers who have previously af
filiated with a national sorority
having a local chapter are in much
the same situation, with the added
condition of almost irrevocable
membership in a distant chapter 1
that prevents them from joining a
congenial group on this campus.
Transfers who have previously af
filiated with a national sorority not
having a local chapter are deprived
even of that one chance to join a
congenial group. Even transfers
who have not previously affiliated
with a national sorority are at a
great disadvantage, because the '
sororities prefer to pledge fresh
men. Since the number of trans
fers is increasing from year to year,
their predicament is a growing
problem.
New women who are lacking in
the social graces — the very ones j
who would benefit most by the i
training a sorority provides — are J
the ones most often overlooked in
rushing. A sorority is not a welfare
bureau; it cannot afford to take
girls who are socially backward. As
a result, these girls are made to
feel their social inferiority even
more, and this reaction impedes 1
their normal social development. It
seems hardly fair that an educa- '
tional institution, suposedly de
signed to develop the fullest capa- j

cities of all the students, should
give them a rating at the beginning
of their callege career that is so
categorical.
:j. Over-emphasis of the social
For a sorority to maintain its
position of social prestige on the'
campus, it is necessary that it stress '
rather trivial superficialities —at the j
expense of the more fundamental
aims of college life. A sorority must I
make a good appearance before the;
campus in general, and the new
women in particular. The group
interest of the sorority is focused on
"getting a class." With the energy
of the group directed at this goal,
the real purposes of college are ob
scured. And this perversion of val
ues affects not only the sorority
women but also others who, being
impressed by the social prestige of
the sorority women, follow the ex
ample that they set.
4. Limitation of associations
It is essentially true that a soro
rity limits the friendships of its
members. While it is obvious that j
I here can be, and sometimes are, j
close friendships between members j
of different houses, or between Row |
women and Hall women, still it is I
apparent that the bulk of close |
friendships are formed within a 1
house. This is only a natural result
of the fact that a girl chooses her ,
friends from among those who are !
most often with her. A freshman i
girl, at an extremely plastic and !
formative age, is asked to select— j
on such an unnatural basis as rush- j
ing parties—one group with whom !
she will live during the remainder |
of her college life.
A college includes many varied
types of girls, and each girl should i
be able to choose her friends from :
all types with equal freedom. Dur
ing her four years of college she •
should be able to select her friends '
without the influence of sorority j
grouping.
5. Hindrance to the social-educative
program of the University
An individual sorority house, be
cause it is a part of a national or- '
ganization, cannot be an integral ,
part of the University residence
system. When a disciplinary case \
arises in a sorority, that sorority is
likely to depend upon the authority ;
of the national organization to
which it belongs, instead of sub- j
mitting the case to A.W.S. officials. |
These sororities, then, practice a
sort of extra-legal autonomy; and
under these circumstances it is im
possible for A.W.S. officials to main- !
tain a uniform enforcement of so- |

cial regulations.
Because the individual sorority
must compete with other sororities
in the race for prestige, a sorority
is obliged to keep its problems se
cret. Without this factor, the so
rorities could benefit by an inter
change of suggestions.
The work of the University in
creating a spirit of citizenship in
the freshman dormitory has been
impeded by the pledging and initia
tion of freshmen. These freshmen
give their first consideration to the
sorority and lose interest in the
affairs of the dormitory.
The work of the University in
character building has been mate
rially hindered by the division of
women into the groups, selected and
unselected. It is detrimental to a
student's emotional adjustment to
have a consciousness either of su
periority or inferiority, to have the
complacency of smugness, or Ihe
bitterness of social bewilderment.
(5. Artificial grouping
The presence of sororities on the
campus creates two distinct classes
—Row and Hall. Until this i year
those groups have been approxi
mately equal in number. Next year
there will be about 27 per cent Row
and 73 per cent Hall. In the very
restriction of proportionate num
bers the Row will become more se
lective, more exclusive, and more
enviable. This situation will pro
duce a breach between the two
groups that will hinder the tradi
tional spirit of Stanford democracy.
The sorority system does not ex
press the spirit of the present; it is
a system that looks to the past for
its excuse for being and the pattern
of its form.
7. Rushing (its effects and condi
tions as taken primarily from
Roblc this year).
Any person living in Roble dur
ing the last rushing period and who
was in a position to know what was

less than completely emotional.
Even to an old girl, who was less

they can, and to cultivate the ac- !
quaintance of any who are likely !
to be rushees. This was reasonably
possible when there were fewer j
than a hundred freshmen, but with J
over two hundred it becomes an |
almost hopeless task.
2. Hardships to special groups of
women
The cruel discrimination against
some girls is unjustifiable, and in !
an educational institution of today
almost unbelievable. Certain girls
often come to college unaware that !
they are not eligible for rushing, j
because of a circumstance which is i
completely beyond their control.
There are legacies who do not
happen to be just the sort of girl
the house wants. They are keenly i
disappointed if they are not bid, '
but they are in a much worse posi
tion when they are. And legacies
who do happen to be just the sort •
of girl the house wants often won- 1
der whether they were bid only
because of their connections.
Transfers who have previously af
filiated with a national sorority
having a local chapter are in much
the same situation, with the added
condition of almost irrevocable
membership in a distant chapter 1
that prevents them from joining a
congenial group on this campus.
Transfers who have previously af
filiated with a national sorority not
having a local chapter are deprived
even of that one chance to join a
congenial group. Even transfers
who have not previously affiliated
with a national sorority are at a
great disadvantage, because the '
sororities prefer to pledge fresh
men. Since the number of trans
fers is increasing from year to year,
their predicament is a growing
problem.
New women who are lacking in
the social graces — the very ones j
who would benefit most by the i
training a sorority provides — are J
the ones most often overlooked in
rushing. A sorority is not a welfare
bureau; it cannot afford to take
girls who are socially backward. As
a result, these girls are made to
feel their social inferiority even
more, and this reaction impedes 1
their normal social development. It
seems hardly fair that an educa- '
tional institution, suposedly de
signed to develop the fullest capa- j

cities of all the students, should
give them a rating at the beginning
of their callege career that is so
categorical.
:j. Over-emphasis of the social
For a sorority to maintain its
position of social prestige on the'
campus, it is necessary that it stress '
rather trivial superficialities —at the j
expense of the more fundamental
aims of college life. A sorority must I
make a good appearance before the;
campus in general, and the new
women in particular. The group
interest of the sorority is focused on
"getting a class." With the energy
of the group directed at this goal,
the real purposes of college are ob
scured. And this perversion of val
ues affects not only the sorority
women but also others who, being
impressed by the social prestige of
the sorority women, follow the ex
ample that they set.
4. Limitation of associations
It is essentially true that a soro
rity limits the friendships of its
members. While it is obvious that j
I here can be, and sometimes are, j
close friendships between members j
of different houses, or between Row |
women and Hall women, still it is I
apparent that the bulk of close |
friendships are formed within a 1
house. This is only a natural result
of the fact that a girl chooses her ,
friends from among those who are !
most often with her. A freshman i
girl, at an extremely plastic and !
formative age, is asked to select— j
on such an unnatural basis as rush- j
ing parties—one group with whom !
she will live during the remainder |
of her college life.
A college includes many varied
types of girls, and each girl should i
be able to choose her friends from :
all types with equal freedom. Dur
ing her four years of college she •
should be able to select her friends '
without the influence of sorority j
grouping.
5. Hindrance to the social-educative
program of the University
An individual sorority house, be
cause it is a part of a national or- '
ganization, cannot be an integral ,
part of the University residence
system. When a disciplinary case \
arises in a sorority, that sorority is
likely to depend upon the authority ;
of the national organization to
which it belongs, instead of sub- j
mitting the case to A.W.S. officials. |
These sororities, then, practice a
sort of extra-legal autonomy; and
under these circumstances it is im
possible for A.W.S. officials to main- !
tain a uniform enforcement of so- |

cial regulations.
Because the individual sorority
must compete with other sororities
in the race for prestige, a sorority
is obliged to keep its problems se
cret. Without this factor, the so
rorities could benefit by an inter
change of suggestions.
The work of the University in
creating a spirit of citizenship in
the freshman dormitory has been
impeded by the pledging and initia
tion of freshmen. These freshmen
give their first consideration to the
sorority and lose interest in the
affairs of the dormitory.
The work of the University in
character building has been mate
rially hindered by the division of
women into the groups, selected and
unselected. It is detrimental to a
student's emotional adjustment to
have a consciousness either of su
periority or inferiority, to have the
complacency of smugness, or Ihe
bitterness of social bewilderment.
(5. Artificial grouping
The presence of sororities on the
campus creates two distinct classes
—Row and Hall. Until this i year
those groups have been approxi
mately equal in number. Next year
there will be about 27 per cent Row
and 73 per cent Hall. In the very
restriction of proportionate num
bers the Row will become more se
lective, more exclusive, and more
enviable. This situation will pro
duce a breach between the two
groups that will hinder the tradi
tional spirit of Stanford democracy.
The sorority system does not ex
press the spirit of the present; it is
a system that looks to the past for
its excuse for being and the pattern
of its form.
7. Rushing (its effects and condi
tions as taken primarily from
Roblc this year).
Any person living in Roble dur
ing the last rushing period and who
was in a position to know what was
happening can describe it as nothing
less than completely emotional.
Even to an old girl, who was less
affected than any other member in
the hall, the high state of nervous
tension was apparent.
There is no question that during
this time studying was neglected
and| the regular routine entirely
disrupted. Bull sessions at all hours,
disregard for all quiet hours, and
continuous speculation and thought
on one subject reversed the condi
tions of ordinary living. The sense
of balance and values was com
pletely distorted.
These were outward manifesta
tions of what was happening; they
would have been apparent even to
a visitor. However, to realize the
effects and the far-reaching results
of the rushing system one must
come to concrete, individual cases.
There was not a new girl in Ro
ble who was not in some way af
fected. It was the culmination of
intimations and whisperings and
inferences which had surounded her
all fall quarter. With the lifting of
the taboo, she could talk openly
about what every girl had thought
of for three months. The mere
rules of the relations of row and
new women during the fall quarter
had over-emphasized the impor
tance of the problem.
It would probably be unfair to
say that new women choose their
friends with an eye to their house
connections or possibilities. But. it
is admitted that, consciously or not,
this does influence their estimation
and evaluation of the girls with
whom they are living.
In the following list of effects and
results of rushing, an attempt has

been made to give representative
examples which will give a pic- ;
ture of the whole.
1. This year there were girls who
received no invitations at all, or
only one or two. The first reaction
in that, case was to build up a de- '
fense, to show everyone else that
they didn't care. But in reality,
there was a turn to self-analysis,
to ask the question, "What is the
matter with me?"
2. In direct contrast with these ;
girls were those who had to do the i
eliminating instead of the houses.
Their mixed feelings of exultation :
and elation were often unfounded.
Disappointments later in the week
were harder than they would have
been in the beginning.
But all of these girls were not
disappointed, and uncertain though
they were, they were already
stamped with a superiority which
is never mentioned but often felt. |
Under this grouping also comes i
the girl who couldn't decide, even 1
up to pledge night. Her own state
of emotion and the effect of it on
others is difficult to estimate, but
certainly far-reaching.
3. There were many who were not
rushed by the house which they
wanted, and so refused all invita
tions with fatal resignation. Their
decision was complete. The major
ity of these girls will probably be
very happy in dormitories, but
their adjustment to college life in a
hall in contrast to their plan for it
in a sorority will not be immediate.
And it will take more than a few
months before they will be able to
have an unprejudiced attitude to
ward the girls in the house which
did not take them.
4. There are always those who
join a house for the sole sake of j
going vow. The unhappiness of
these girls while making a decision
is only the beginning of three years'
unhappiness in a second - choice
group. 4
If more detailed cases were given,
as they could be, the illustrations
would show unpleasantness and in
justice.
To see truly what happens dur
ing a rushing season, to conceive
its immediate and ultimate effects
as they have been this year and as
they will be next year, is to be
convinced that in them alone is jus
tification for the abolition of the
sorority system.
Tine culmination of more than
two months' investigation of the
Stanford sorority system by the
A.W.S. commission organized for
this purpose comes in the report j
printed below. This report is not j
an affair brought up by the ad- ,
ministration. It was initiated by j
students; the work on it was done j
by students; and the final judgment
of it will be up to the students, ac- !
cording to the commission.
The commission has endeavored
to present a fair, unbiased consid
eration of the matter and will put i
the question to the rest of the cam- '
pus next week.
PREFACE
A.W.S. Sorority Commission Report
The A.W.S. sorority commission, '
representing all groups of the campus ;
for the purpose of impartial investi
gation and discussion of the so- |
rority system. The results were to j
be tabulated in a single report.
This was not possible. The only
method of procedure which the
commission could take was to have j
one group present disadvantages, j
the other advantages.
As it is submitted, the report is
in two parts. Each part was written j
by a group of volunteers who j
wanted to present one side. The i
result is a report of two expressions j
of opinion. No statement on the
list either of assets or liabilities is j
to be construed as representative
of a conclusion reached by the ;
whole commission.
ADVANTAGES
1. People love organizations. Like i
will flock together in clubs. It is
better to have organized fraternity |
groups under control than miscel
laneous independent clubs. Snob
bishness exists in social cliques i
more intensively than in fraterni
ties and has no tangible center in
the latter which can be attached. |
2. The fraternity fosters friend- i
ships. One can be friends only with
a limited number. There are dan- '
gers of forgetting college's oppor
tunity for friendship if one tries to '
know equally well all of a large '
student body.
3. The fraternity brings together
girls of varied tastes and activities
so Ihat it is broader than a de
partment club. Fraternity encour- '
ages the appreciation of all lines of
scholarship and forms bonds of con
geniality bigger than the interest
in one's individual affairs or that i
found in social cliques based on the '
Similarity of interests.
4. The fraternity stands for the
best college ideals. It is a group
unit through which it is easy to
reach and influence individual stu
dents. Its close relationships make
possible a stronger influence on the
individual than faculty or dormi
tory alone can have. As a group a
chapter can more effectively for
ward college activities than can
girls working individually.
5. The national charter in a fra
rnity broadens the viewpoint be
cause of its interest in and appre
ciation for other colegcs. Thereby
it counteracts the prevailing pro
vincialism and egotism of most
campuses. This contact with other
colleges gives the fraternity woman
contact and a possibility for friend
-1 lip throughout the country.
6. The fraternity holds the inter
est of alutnnae and keeps them in
touch v/ith college, its work and
its needs, and brings them back for
visits.
7. The fraternity stands for high
scholarship and helps members to
('') good consistent work. For these
reasons study tables have been es
tablished in the houses and a grade
rating set up to be met by pros
pective members.
6. The fraternity recognizes that
intellectual pursuits are not the
only thing necessary to develop
womanly citizens. r rhe size of stu
dent bodies and modern educational
methods make it impossible for a
college to do much for students
outside the class room. Fraternities
give members the development and
training found in the cohesive or
ganization of an Oxford college.
Through chapter social activities
id support of college enterprises,
fraternities extend in a measure this
same sort of help to the rest of
the student body.
9. Close friendships and a com
munity of interests in a chapter de
velop unselfishness, adaptability, co
operation, tact, honor, and in it ia
i ve. In the student body many a
student's talent atrophies and her
initiative power remains undevel
oped because there are no demands
for its exercise upon every student,
while in a fraternity each girl mem
ber must carry her share of work,
activity, and responsibility.
10. As part of a national organi
zation with high ideals a chapter
must strive to represent its fra
ternity well. It is constantly urged
to appreciate its duty as an orga
nized member of the community.
This, with the chapter's opportuni
ties for service and hospitality to
students and friends, encourages in
vvery member tolerance, generosity,
a sense of personal responsibility,
thoughtfulness, consideration for
others, and interest in a world be
yond one's own door.
11. Chapter fellowship gives
pleasure to individuals and encour
ages each one to make the most of
./ne's self without forgetting one's
obligations not to advance at the
expense of others. Growth comes
through pleasure as well as through
work, so this companionship means
much at the time.
12. Chapter life with its duties
and responsibility more nearly ap
roaches home life than does any
dormitory plan.
13. The test of college organiza
tion is: does it advance or hinder
ihe real object of college? Does it
make for higher or lower scholar
ship? Investigations and reports on
universities commend fraternity
bapters for help along both these
Jines.
14. Fraternities give pleasure to
members, college and alumnae. In
zeal for the good of the whole, one
group should not be denied the
right of its own happiness. <
15. The fraternity has become
nore of a living group than a se
cret society, for it is recognized that
all are based upon the identical
principles of truth, honor, friend
ship, and loyalty. The difference
among the fraternities is merely in
the varied manner or procedure of
initiation ceremonies, in order to
impress their members with the
.significance of these ideals.
Hi. The process of selecting new
members for (he fraternity is one
open 1o change and is an existing
evil which can be minimized or
completely eliminated by a com
mon sense revision of the present
rushing system and rules. Many
J: the objections to the fraternity
system are objections merely to the
existing rushing system found at
Stanford rather than inherent dis
advantages of the fraternity itself.
And we feel that the time could be
more profitably spent in formulat
ing a plan for the reorganization
t rushing rather than the abolition
of sororities.

DISADVANTAGES
1. The burden of rushing on the
sorority women
The intensive effort required for
a successful season of rushing can
not help taking its toll from the
sorority women. The weeks of ac
tual rushing demand a great deal of
time and energy. It is well known
that scholarship takes a drop dur
ing this period; and women who
try to meet the requirements of
regular academic work as well as
the requirements of rushing often
find their health impaired. There
is also a financial burden. The av
erage sorority member contributes
seventeen dollars for each rushing
season — even with the simplest
standards of entertaihment that
Pan-Hellenic can devise.
During this time of highly or
ganized entertaining, the sorority
women must be selecting the
"class." This is an extremely diffi
cult task; for unless the sorority is
a distinct type, there must inevi
tably be differences of opinion in
this selection. Many unfortunate
incidents occur, such as angry dis
agreements between sorority mem
bers, the disappointment of the
sorority member whose freshman
friend is "dinged"' by her sorority,
the interference of alumnae who
insist upon the sorority's taking a
certain freshman that the sorority
does not want, and so on.
But the really insidious thing
about rushing is that it is not con
fined to the period of entertainment
—it is going on all the time. Dur
ing the summer, the sorority women
are busy getting acquainted with,
if not actually rushing, the enter
ing women near their homes. Dur
ing fall quarter they are careful to
make a good impression on the
freshmen, and upon those who j
might influence them. The sorority |
women are expected to learn the
names of as many freshmen as
they can, and to cultivate the ac- !
quaintance of any who are likely !
to be rushees. This was reasonably
possible when there were fewer j
than a hundred freshmen, but with J
over two hundred it becomes an |
almost hopeless task.
2. Hardships to special groups of
women
The cruel discrimination against
some girls is unjustifiable, and in !
an educational institution of today

completely beyond their control.

but they are in a much worse posi
tion when they are. And legacies
who do happen to be just the sort •

der whether they were bid only

filiated with a national sorority
having a local chapter are in much
the same situation, with the added
condition of almost irrevocable
membership in a distant chapter 1
that prevents them from joining a
congenial group on this campus.
Transfers who have previously af
filiated with a national sorority not

even of that one chance to join a
congenial group. Even transfers
who have not previously affiliated
with a national sorority are at a
great disadvantage, because the '

ing her four years of college she •
should be able to select her friends '

5. The national charter in a fra
rnity broadens the viewpoint be
cause of its interest in and appre
ciation for other colegcs. Thereby
it counteracts the prevailing pro
vincialism and egotism of most
campuses. This contact with other
colleges gives the fraternity woman
contact and a possibility for friend
-1 lip throughout the country.
6. The fraternity holds the inter
est of alutnnae and keeps them in
touch v/ith college, its work and
its needs, and brings them back for
visits.
7. The fraternity stands for high
scholarship and helps members to
('') good consistent work. For these
reasons study tables have been es
tablished in the houses and a grade
rating set up to be met by pros
pective members.
6. The fraternity recognizes that
intellectual pursuits are not the
only thing necessary to develop
womanly citizens. r rhe size of stu
dent bodies and modern educational
methods make it impossible for a
college to do much for students
outside the class room. Fraternities
give members the development and
training found in the cohesive or
ganization of an Oxford college.
Through chapter social activities
id support of college enterprises,
fraternities extend in a measure this
same sort of help to the rest of
the student body.
9. Close friendships and a com
munity of interests in a chapter de
velop unselfishness, adaptability, co
operation, tact, honor, and in it ia
i ve. In the student body many a
student's talent atrophies and her
initiative power remains undevel
oped because there are no demands
for its exercise upon every student,
while in a fraternity each girl mem
ber must carry her share of work,
activity, and responsibility.
10. As part of a national organi
zation with high ideals a chapter
must strive to represent its fra
ternity well. It is constantly urged
to appreciate its duty as an orga
nized member of the community.
This, with the chapter's opportuni
ties for service and hospitality to
students and friends, encourages in
vvery member tolerance, generosity,
a sense of personal responsibility,
thoughtfulness, consideration for
others, and interest in a world be
yond one's own door.
11. Chapter fellowship gives
pleasure to individuals and encour
ages each one to make the most of
./ne's self without forgetting one's
obligations not to advance at the
expense of others. Growth comes
through pleasure as well as through
work, so this companionship means
much at the time.
12. Chapter life with its duties
and responsibility more nearly ap
roaches home life than does any
dormitory plan.
13. The test of college organiza
tion is: does it advance or hinder
ihe real object of college? Does it
make for higher or lower scholar
ship? Investigations and reports on
universities commend fraternity
bapters for help along both these
Jines.
14. Fraternities give pleasure to
members, college and alumnae. In
zeal for the good of the whole, one
group should not be denied the
right of its own happiness. <
15. The fraternity has become
nore of a living group than a se
cret society, for it is recognized that
all are based upon the identical
principles of truth, honor, friend
ship, and loyalty. The difference
among the fraternities is merely in
the varied manner or procedure of
initiation ceremonies, in order to
impress their members with the
.significance of these ideals.
Hi. The process of selecting new
members for (he fraternity is one
open 1o change and is an existing
evil which can be minimized or
completely eliminated by a com
mon sense revision of the present
rushing system and rules. Many
J: the objections to the fraternity
system are objections merely to the
existing rushing system found at
Stanford rather than inherent dis
advantages of the fraternity itself.
And we feel that the time could be
more profitably spent in formulat
ing a plan for the reorganization
t rushing rather than the abolition
of sororities.

DISADVANTAGES
1. The burden of rushing on the
sorority women
The intensive effort required for
a successful season of rushing can
not help taking its toll from the
sorority women. The weeks of ac
tual rushing demand a great deal of
time and energy. It is well known
that scholarship takes a drop dur
ing this period; and women who
try to meet the requirements of
regular academic work as well as
the requirements of rushing often
find their health impaired. There
is also a financial burden. The av
erage sorority member contributes
seventeen dollars for each rushing
season — even with the simplest
standards of entertaihment that
Pan-Hellenic can devise.
During this time of highly or
ganized entertaining, the sorority
women must be selecting the
"class." This is an extremely diffi
cult task; for unless the sorority is
a distinct type, there must inevi
tably be differences of opinion in
this selection. Many unfortunate
incidents occur, such as angry dis
agreements between sorority mem
bers, the disappointment of the
sorority member whose freshman
friend is "dinged"' by her sorority,
the interference of alumnae who
insist upon the sorority's taking a
certain freshman that the sorority
does not want, and so on.
But the really insidious thing
about rushing is that it is not con
fined to the period of entertainment
—it is going on all the time. Dur
ing the summer, the sorority women
are busy getting acquainted with,
if not actually rushing, the enter
ing women near their homes. Dur
ing fall quarter they are careful to
make a good impression on the
freshmen, and upon those who j
might influence them. The sorority |
women are expected to learn the
names of as many freshmen as
they can, and to cultivate the ac- !
quaintance of any who are likely !
to be rushees. This was reasonably
possible when there were fewer j
than a hundred freshmen, but with J
over two hundred it becomes an |
almost hopeless task.
2. Hardships to special groups of
women
The cruel discrimination against
some girls is unjustifiable, and in !
an educational institution of today
almost unbelievable. Certain girls
often come to college unaware that !
they are not eligible for rushing, j
because of a circumstance which is i
completely beyond their control.
There are legacies who do not
happen to be just the sort of girl
the house wants. They are keenly i
disappointed if they are not bid, '
but they are in a much worse posi
tion when they are. And legacies
who do happen to be just the sort •
of girl the house wants often won- 1
der whether they were bid only
because of their connections.
Transfers who have previously af
filiated with a national sorority
having a local chapter are in much
the same situation, with the added
condition of almost irrevocable
membership in a distant chapter 1
that prevents them from joining a
congenial group on this campus.
Transfers who have previously af
filiated with a national sorority not
having a local chapter are deprived
even of that one chance to join a
congenial group. Even transfers
who have not previously affiliated
with a national sorority are at a
great disadvantage, because the '
sororities prefer to pledge fresh
men. Since the number of trans
fers is increasing from year to year,
their predicament is a growing
problem.
New women who are lacking in
the social graces — the very ones j
who would benefit most by the i
training a sorority provides — are J
the ones most often overlooked in
rushing. A sorority is not a welfare
bureau; it cannot afford to take
girls who are socially backward. As
a result, these girls are made to
feel their social inferiority even
more, and this reaction impedes 1
their normal social development. It
seems hardly fair that an educa- '
tional institution, suposedly de
signed to develop the fullest capa- j

cities of all the students, should
give them a rating at the beginning
of their callege career that is so
categorical.
:j. Over-emphasis of the social
For a sorority to maintain its
position of social prestige on the'
campus, it is necessary that it stress '
rather trivial superficialities —at the j
expense of the more fundamental
aims of college life. A sorority must I
make a good appearance before the;
campus in general, and the new
women in particular. The group
interest of the sorority is focused on
"getting a class." With the energy
of the group directed at this goal,
the real purposes of college are ob
scured. And this perversion of val
ues affects not only the sorority
women but also others who, being
impressed by the social prestige of
the sorority women, follow the ex
ample that they set.
4. Limitation of associations
It is essentially true that a soro
rity limits the friendships of its
members. While it is obvious that j
I here can be, and sometimes are, j
close friendships between members j
of different houses, or between Row |
women and Hall women, still it is I
apparent that the bulk of close |
friendships are formed within a 1
house. This is only a natural result
of the fact that a girl chooses her ,
friends from among those who are !
most often with her. A freshman i
girl, at an extremely plastic and !
formative age, is asked to select— j
on such an unnatural basis as rush- j
ing parties—one group with whom !
she will live during the remainder |
of her college life.
A college includes many varied
types of girls, and each girl should i
be able to choose her friends from :
all types with equal freedom. Dur
ing her four years of college she •
should be able to select her friends '
without the influence of sorority j
grouping.
5. Hindrance to the social-educative
program of the University
An individual sorority house, be
cause it is a part of a national or- '
ganization, cannot be an integral ,
part of the University residence
system. When a disciplinary case \
arises in a sorority, that sorority is
likely to depend upon the authority ;
of the national organization to
which it belongs, instead of sub- j
mitting the case to A.W.S. officials. |
These sororities, then, practice a
sort of extra-legal autonomy; and
under these circumstances it is im
possible for A.W.S. officials to main- !
tain a uniform enforcement of so- |

cial regulations.
Because the individual sorority
must compete with other sororities
in the race for prestige, a sorority
is obliged to keep its problems se
cret. Without this factor, the so
rorities could benefit by an inter
change of suggestions.
The work of the University in
creating a spirit of citizenship in
the freshman dormitory has been
impeded by the pledging and initia
tion of freshmen. These freshmen
give their first consideration to the
sorority and lose interest in the
affairs of the dormitory.
The work of the University in
character building has been mate
rially hindered by the division of
women into the groups, selected and
unselected. It is detrimental to a
student's emotional adjustment to
have a consciousness either of su
periority or inferiority, to have the
complacency of smugness, or Ihe
bitterness of social bewilderment.
(5. Artificial grouping
The presence of sororities on the
campus creates two distinct classes
—Row and Hall. Until this i year
those groups have been approxi
mately equal in number. Next year
there will be about 27 per cent Row
and 73 per cent Hall. In the very
restriction of proportionate num
bers the Row will become more se
lective, more exclusive, and more
enviable. This situation will pro
duce a breach between the two
groups that will hinder the tradi
tional spirit of Stanford democracy.
The sorority system does not ex
press the spirit of the present; it is
a system that looks to the past for
its excuse for being and the pattern
of its form.
7. Rushing (its effects and condi
tions as taken primarily from
Roblc this year).
Any person living in Roble dur
ing the last rushing period and who
was in a position to know what was
happening can describe it as nothing
less than completely emotional.
Even to an old girl, who was less
affected than any other member in
the hall, the high state of nervous
tension was apparent.
There is no question that during
this time studying was neglected
and| the regular routine entirely
disrupted. Bull sessions at all hours,
disregard for all quiet hours, and
continuous speculation and thought
on one subject reversed the condi
tions of ordinary living. The sense
of balance and values was com
pletely distorted.
These were outward manifesta
tions of what was happening; they
would have been apparent even to
a visitor. However, to realize the
effects and the far-reaching results
of the rushing system one must
come to concrete, individual cases.
There was not a new girl in Ro
ble who was not in some way af
fected. It was the culmination of
intimations and whisperings and
inferences which had surounded her
all fall quarter. With the lifting of
the taboo, she could talk openly
about what every girl had thought
of for three months. The mere
rules of the relations of row and
new women during the fall quarter
had over-emphasized the impor
tance of the problem.
It would probably be unfair to
say that new women choose their
friends with an eye to their house
connections or possibilities. But. it
is admitted that, consciously or not,
this does influence their estimation
and evaluation of the girls with
whom they are living.
In the following list of effects and
results of rushing, an attempt has

been made to give representative
examples which will give a pic- ;
ture of the whole.
1. This year there were girls who
received no invitations at all, or
only one or two. The first reaction
in that, case was to build up a de- '
fense, to show everyone else that
they didn't care. But in reality,
there was a turn to self-analysis,
to ask the question, "What is the
matter with me?"
2. In direct contrast with these ;
girls were those who had to do the i
eliminating instead of the houses.
Their mixed feelings of exultation :
and elation were often unfounded.
Disappointments later in the week
were harder than they would have
been in the beginning.
But all of these girls were not
disappointed, and uncertain though
they were, they were already
stamped with a superiority which
is never mentioned but often felt. |
Under this grouping also comes i
the girl who couldn't decide, even 1
up to pledge night. Her own state
of emotion and the effect of it on
others is difficult to estimate, but
certainly far-reaching.
3. There were many who were not
rushed by the house which they
wanted, and so refused all invita
tions with fatal resignation. Their
decision was complete. The major
ity of these girls will probably be
very happy in dormitories, but
their adjustment to college life in a
hall in contrast to their plan for it
in a sorority will not be immediate.
And it will take more than a few
months before they will be able to
have an unprejudiced attitude to
ward the girls in the house which
did not take them.
4. There are always those who
join a house for the sole sake of j
going vow. The unhappiness of
these girls while making a decision
is only the beginning of three years'
unhappiness in a second - choice
group. 4
If more detailed cases were given,
as they could be, the illustrations
would show unpleasantness and in
justice.
To see truly what happens dur
ing a rushing season, to conceive
its immediate and ultimate effects
as they have been this year and as
they will be next year, is to be
convinced that in them alone is jus
tification for the abolition of the
sorority system.
Tine culmination of more than
two months' investigation of the
Stanford sorority system by the
A.W.S. commission organized for
this purpose comes in the report j
printed below. This report is not j
an affair brought up by the ad- ,
ministration. It was initiated by j
students; the work on it was done j
by students; and the final judgment
of it will be up to the students, ac- !
cording to the commission.
The commission has endeavored
to present a fair, unbiased consid
eration of the matter and will put i
the question to the rest of the cam- '
pus next week.
PREFACE
A.W.S. Sorority Commission Report
The A.W.S. sorority commission, '
representing all groups of the campus ;
for the purpose of impartial investi
gation and discussion of the so- |
rority system. The results were to j
be tabulated in a single report.
This was not possible. The only
method of procedure which the
commission could take was to have j
one group present disadvantages, j
the other advantages.
As it is submitted, the report is
in two parts. Each part was written j
by a group of volunteers who j
wanted to present one side. The i
result is a report of two expressions j
of opinion. No statement on the
list either of assets or liabilities is j
to be construed as representative
of a conclusion reached by the ;
whole commission.
ADVANTAGES
1. People love organizations. Like i
will flock together in clubs. It is
better to have organized fraternity |
groups under control than miscel
laneous independent clubs. Snob
bishness exists in social cliques i
more intensively than in fraterni
ties and has no tangible center in
the latter which can be attached. |
2. The fraternity fosters friend- i
ships. One can be friends only with
a limited number. There are dan- '
gers of forgetting college's oppor
tunity for friendship if one tries to '
know equally well all of a large '
student body.
3. The fraternity brings together
girls of varied tastes and activities
so Ihat it is broader than a de
partment club. Fraternity encour- '
ages the appreciation of all lines of
scholarship and forms bonds of con
geniality bigger than the interest
in one's individual affairs or that i
found in social cliques based on the '
Similarity of interests.
4. The fraternity stands for the
best college ideals. It is a group
unit through which it is easy to
reach and influence individual stu
dents. Its close relationships make
possible a stronger influence on the
individual than faculty or dormi
tory alone can have. As a group a
chapter can more effectively for
ward college activities than can
girls working individually.
5. The national charter in a fra
rnity broadens the viewpoint be
cause of its interest in and appre
ciation for other colegcs. Thereby
it counteracts the prevailing pro
vincialism and egotism of most
campuses. This contact with other
colleges gives the fraternity woman
contact and a possibility for friend
-1 lip throughout the country.
6. The fraternity holds the inter
est of alutnnae and keeps them in
touch v/ith college, its work and
its needs, and brings them back for
visits.
7. The fraternity stands for high
scholarship and helps members to
('') good consistent work. For these
reasons study tables have been es
tablished in the houses and a grade
rating set up to be met by pros
pective members.
6. The fraternity recognizes that
intellectual pursuits are not the
only thing necessary to develop
womanly citizens. r rhe size of stu
dent bodies and modern educational

Through chapter social activities

same sort of help to the rest of

9. Close friendships and a com
munity of interests in a chapter de
velop unselfishness, adaptability, co
operation, tact, honor, and in it ia
i ve. In the student body many a
student's talent atrophies and her
initiative power remains undevel
oped because there are no demands
for its exercise upon every student,
while in a fraternity each girl mem
ber must carry her share of work,
activity, and responsibility.
10. As part of a national organi
zation with high ideals a chapter

ternity well. It is constantly urged
to appreciate its duty as an orga
nized member of the community.
This, with the chapter's opportuni
ties for service and hospitality to
students and friends, encourages in
vvery member tolerance, generosity,
a sense of personal responsibility,
thoughtfulness, consideration for
others, and interest in a world be
yond one's own door.
11. Chapter fellowship gives
pleasure to individuals and encour
ages each one to make the most of
./ne's self without forgetting one's
obligations not to advance at the
expense of others. Growth comes
through pleasure as well as through
work, so this companionship means

There was not a new girl in Ro
ble who was not in some way af
fected. It was the culmination of
intimations and whisperings and
inferences which had surounded her
all fall quarter. With the lifting of
the taboo, she could talk openly
about what every girl had thought
of for three months. The mere
rules of the relations of row and
new women during the fall quarter
had over-emphasized the impor
tance of the problem.
It would probably be unfair to
say that new women choose their
friends with an eye to their house
connections or possibilities. But. it
is admitted that, consciously or not,
this does influence their estimation
and evaluation of the girls with
whom they are living.
In the following list of effects and
results of rushing, an attempt has

been made to give representative
examples which will give a pic- ;
ture of the whole.
1. This year there were girls who
received no invitations at all, or
only one or two. The first reaction
in that, case was to build up a de- '
fense, to show everyone else that
they didn't care. But in reality,
there was a turn to self-analysis,
to ask the question, "What is the
matter with me?"
2. In direct contrast with these ;
girls were those who had to do the i
eliminating instead of the houses.
Their mixed feelings of exultation :
and elation were often unfounded.
Disappointments later in the week
were harder than they would have
been in the beginning.
But all of these girls were not
disappointed, and uncertain though
they were, they were already
stamped with a superiority which
is never mentioned but often felt. |
Under this grouping also comes i
the girl who couldn't decide, even 1
up to pledge night. Her own state
of emotion and the effect of it on
others is difficult to estimate, but
certainly far-reaching.
3. There were many who were not
rushed by the house which they
wanted, and so refused all invita
tions with fatal resignation. Their
decision was complete. The major
ity of these girls will probably be
very happy in dormitories, but
their adjustment to college life in a
hall in contrast to their plan for it
in a sorority will not be immediate.
And it will take more than a few
months before they will be able to
have an unprejudiced attitude to
ward the girls in the house which
did not take them.
4. There are always those who
join a house for the sole sake of j
going vow. The unhappiness of
these girls while making a decision
is only the beginning of three years'
unhappiness in a second - choice
group. 4
If more detailed cases were given,
as they could be, the illustrations
would show unpleasantness and in
justice.
To see truly what happens dur
ing a rushing season, to conceive
its immediate and ultimate effects
as they have been this year and as
they will be next year, is to be
convinced that in them alone is jus
tification for the abolition of the
sorority system.
Tine culmination of more than
two months' investigation of the
Stanford sorority system by the
A.W.S. commission organized for
this purpose comes in the report j
printed below. This report is not j
an affair brought up by the ad- ,
ministration. It was initiated by j
students; the work on it was done j
by students; and the final judgment
of it will be up to the students, ac- !
cording to the commission.
The commission has endeavored
to present a fair, unbiased consid
eration of the matter and will put i
the question to the rest of the cam- '
pus next week.
PREFACE
A.W.S. Sorority Commission Report
The A.W.S. sorority commission, '
representing all groups of the campus ;
for the purpose of impartial investi
gation and discussion of the so- |
rority system. The results were to j
be tabulated in a single report.
This was not possible. The only
method of procedure which the
commission could take was to have j
one group present disadvantages, j
the other advantages.
As it is submitted, the report is
in two parts. Each part was written j
by a group of volunteers who j
wanted to present one side. The i
result is a report of two expressions j
of opinion. No statement on the
list either of assets or liabilities is j
to be construed as representative
of a conclusion reached by the ;
whole commission.
ADVANTAGES
1. People love organizations. Like i
will flock together in clubs. It is
better to have organized fraternity |
groups under control than miscel
laneous independent clubs. Snob
bishness exists in social cliques i
more intensively than in fraterni
ties and has no tangible center in
the latter which can be attached. |
2. The fraternity fosters friend- i
ships. One can be friends only with
a limited number. There are dan- '
gers of forgetting college's oppor
tunity for friendship if one tries to '
know equally well all of a large '
student body.
3. The fraternity brings together
girls of varied tastes and activities
so Ihat it is broader than a de
partment club. Fraternity encour- '
ages the appreciation of all lines of
scholarship and forms bonds of con
geniality bigger than the interest
in one's individual affairs or that i
found in social cliques based on the '
Similarity of interests.
4. The fraternity stands for the
best college ideals. It is a group
unit through which it is easy to
reach and influence individual stu
dents. Its close relationships make
possible a stronger influence on the
individual than faculty or dormi
tory alone can have. As a group a
chapter can more effectively for
ward college activities than can
girls working individually.
5. The national charter in a fra
rnity broadens the viewpoint be
cause of its interest in and appre
ciation for other colegcs. Thereby
it counteracts the prevailing pro
vincialism and egotism of most
campuses. This contact with other
colleges gives the fraternity woman
contact and a possibility for friend
-1 lip throughout the country.
6. The fraternity holds the inter
est of alutnnae and keeps them in
touch v/ith college, its work and
its needs, and brings them back for
visits.
7. The fraternity stands for high
scholarship and helps members to
('') good consistent work. For these
reasons study tables have been es
tablished in the houses and a grade
rating set up to be met by pros
pective members.
6. The fraternity recognizes that
intellectual pursuits are not the
only thing necessary to develop
womanly citizens. r rhe size of stu
dent bodies and modern educational
methods make it impossible for a
college to do much for students
outside the class room. Fraternities
give members the development and
training found in the cohesive or
ganization of an Oxford college.
Through chapter social activities
id support of college enterprises,
fraternities extend in a measure this
same sort of help to the rest of
the student body.
9. Close friendships and a com
munity of interests in a chapter de
velop unselfishness, adaptability, co
operation, tact, honor, and in it ia
i ve. In the student body many a
student's talent atrophies and her
initiative power remains undevel
oped because there are no demands
for its exercise upon every student,
while in a fraternity each girl mem
ber must carry her share of work,
activity, and responsibility.
10. As part of a national organi
zation with high ideals a chapter
must strive to represent its fra
ternity well. It is constantly urged
to appreciate its duty as an orga
nized member of the community.
This, with the chapter's opportuni
ties for service and hospitality to
students and friends, encourages in
vvery member tolerance, generosity,
a sense of personal responsibility,
thoughtfulness, consideration for
others, and interest in a world be
yond one's own door.
11. Chapter fellowship gives
pleasure to individuals and encour
ages each one to make the most of
./ne's self without forgetting one's
obligations not to advance at the
expense of others. Growth comes
through pleasure as well as through
work, so this companionship means
much at the time.
12. Chapter life with its duties
and responsibility more nearly ap
roaches home life than does any
dormitory plan.
13. The test of college organiza
tion is: does it advance or hinder
ihe real object of college? Does it
make for higher or lower scholar
ship? Investigations and reports on
universities commend fraternity
bapters for help along both these
Jines.
14. Fraternities give pleasure to
members, college and alumnae. In
zeal for the good of the whole, one
group should not be denied the
right of its own happiness. <
15. The fraternity has become
nore of a living group than a se
cret society, for it is recognized that
all are based upon the identical
principles of truth, honor, friend
ship, and loyalty. The difference
among the fraternities is merely in
the varied manner or procedure of
initiation ceremonies, in order to
impress their members with the
.significance of these ideals.
Hi. The process of selecting new
members for (he fraternity is one
open 1o change and is an existing
evil which can be minimized or
completely eliminated by a com
mon sense revision of the present
rushing system and rules. Many
J: the objections to the fraternity
system are objections merely to the
existing rushing system found at
Stanford rather than inherent dis
advantages of the fraternity itself.
And we feel that the time could be
more profitably spent in formulat
ing a plan for the reorganization
t rushing rather than the abolition
of sororities.

DISADVANTAGES
1. The burden of rushing on the
sorority women
The intensive effort required for
a successful season of rushing can
not help taking its toll from the
sorority women. The weeks of ac
tual rushing demand a great deal of
time and energy. It is well known
that scholarship takes a drop dur
ing this period; and women who
try to meet the requirements of
regular academic work as well as
the requirements of rushing often
find their health impaired. There
is also a financial burden. The av
erage sorority member contributes
seventeen dollars for each rushing
season — even with the simplest
standards of entertaihment that
Pan-Hellenic can devise.
During this time of highly or
ganized entertaining, the sorority
women must be selecting the
"class." This is an extremely diffi
cult task; for unless the sorority is
a distinct type, there must inevi
tably be differences of opinion in
this selection. Many unfortunate
incidents occur, such as angry dis
agreements between sorority mem
bers, the disappointment of the
sorority member whose freshman
friend is "dinged"' by her sorority,
the interference of alumnae who
insist upon the sorority's taking a
certain freshman that the sorority
does not want, and so on.
But the really insidious thing
about rushing is that it is not con
fined to the period of entertainment
—it is going on all the time. Dur
ing the summer, the sorority women
are busy getting acquainted with,
if not actually rushing, the enter
ing women near their homes. Dur
ing fall quarter they are careful to
make a good impression on the
freshmen, and upon those who j
might influence them. The sorority |
women are expected to learn the
names of as many freshmen as
they can, and to cultivate the ac- !
quaintance of any who are likely !
to be rushees. This was reasonably
possible when there were fewer j
than a hundred freshmen, but with J
over two hundred it becomes an |
almost hopeless task.
2. Hardships to special groups of
women
The cruel discrimination against
some girls is unjustifiable, and in !
an educational institution of today
almost unbelievable. Certain girls
often come to college unaware that !
they are not eligible for rushing, j
because of a circumstance which is i
completely beyond their control.
There are legacies who do not
happen to be just the sort of girl
the house wants. They are keenly i
disappointed if they are not bid, '
but they are in a much worse posi
tion when they are. And legacies
who do happen to be just the sort •
of girl the house wants often won- 1
der whether they were bid only
because of their connections.
Transfers who have previously af
filiated with a national sorority
having a local chapter are in much
the same situation, with the added
condition of almost irrevocable
membership in a distant chapter 1
that prevents them from joining a
congenial group on this campus.
Transfers who have previously af
filiated with a national sorority not
having a local chapter are deprived
even of that one chance to join a
congenial group. Even transfers
who have not previously affiliated
with a national sorority are at a
great disadvantage, because the '
sororities prefer to pledge fresh
men. Since the number of trans
fers is increasing from year to year,
their predicament is a growing
problem.
New women who are lacking in
the social graces — the very ones j
who would benefit most by the i
training a sorority provides — are J
the ones most often overlooked in
rushing. A sorority is not a welfare
bureau; it cannot afford to take
girls who are socially backward. As
a result, these girls are made to
feel their social inferiority even
more, and this reaction impedes 1
their normal social development. It
seems hardly fair that an educa- '
tional institution, suposedly de
signed to develop the fullest capa- j

cities of all the students, should
give them a rating at the beginning
of their callege career that is so
categorical.
:j. Over-emphasis of the social
For a sorority to maintain its
position of social prestige on the'
campus, it is necessary that it stress '
rather trivial superficialities —at the j
expense of the more fundamental
aims of college life. A sorority must I
make a good appearance before the;
campus in general, and the new
women in particular. The group
interest of the sorority is focused on
"getting a class." With the energy
of the group directed at this goal,
the real purposes of college are ob
scured. And this perversion of val
ues affects not only the sorority
women but also others who, being
impressed by the social prestige of
the sorority women, follow the ex
ample that they set.
4. Limitation of associations
It is essentially true that a soro
rity limits the friendships of its
members. While it is obvious that j
I here can be, and sometimes are, j
close friendships between members j
of different houses, or between Row |
women and Hall women, still it is I
apparent that the bulk of close |
friendships are formed within a 1
house. This is only a natural result
of the fact that a girl chooses her ,
friends from among those who are !
most often with her. A freshman i
girl, at an extremely plastic and !
formative age, is asked to select— j
on such an unnatural basis as rush- j
ing parties—one group with whom !
she will live during the remainder |
of her college life.
A college includes many varied
types of girls, and each girl should i
be able to choose her friends from :
all types with equal freedom. Dur
ing her four years of college she •
should be able to select her friends '
without the influence of sorority j
grouping.
5. Hindrance to the social-educative
program of the University
An individual sorority house, be
cause it is a part of a national or- '
ganization, cannot be an integral ,
part of the University residence
system. When a disciplinary case \
arises in a sorority, that sorority is
likely to depend upon the authority ;
of the national organization to
which it belongs, instead of sub- j
mitting the case to A.W.S. officials. |
These sororities, then, practice a
sort of extra-legal autonomy; and
under these circumstances it is im
possible for A.W.S. officials to main- !
tain a uniform enforcement of so- |

cial regulations.
Because the individual sorority
must compete with other sororities
in the race for prestige, a sorority
is obliged to keep its problems se
cret. Without this factor, the so
rorities could benefit by an inter
change of suggestions.
The work of the University in
creating a spirit of citizenship in
the freshman dormitory has been
impeded by the pledging and initia
tion of freshmen. These freshmen
give their first consideration to the
sorority and lose interest in the
affairs of the dormitory.
The work of the University in
character building has been mate
rially hindered by the division of
women into the groups, selected and
unselected. It is detrimental to a
student's emotional adjustment to
have a consciousness either of su
periority or inferiority, to have the
complacency of smugness, or Ihe
bitterness of social bewilderment.
(5. Artificial grouping
The presence of sororities on the
campus creates two distinct classes
—Row and Hall. Until this i year
those groups have been approxi
mately equal in number. Next year
there will be about 27 per cent Row
and 73 per cent Hall. In the very
restriction of proportionate num
bers the Row will become more se
lective, more exclusive, and more
enviable. This situation will pro
duce a breach between the two
groups that will hinder the tradi
tional spirit of Stanford democracy.
The sorority system does not ex
press the spirit of the present; it is
a system that looks to the past for
its excuse for being and the pattern
of its form.
7. Rushing (its effects and condi
tions as taken primarily from
Roblc this year).
Any person living in Roble dur
ing the last rushing period and who
was in a position to know what was
happening can describe it as nothing
less than completely emotional.
Even to an old girl, who was less
affected than any other member in
the hall, the high state of nervous
tension was apparent.
There is no question that during
this time studying was neglected
and| the regular routine entirely
disrupted. Bull sessions at all hours,
disregard for all quiet hours, and
continuous speculation and thought
on one subject reversed the condi
tions of ordinary living. The sense
of balance and values was com
pletely distorted.
These were outward manifesta
tions of what was happening; they
would have been apparent even to
a visitor. However, to realize the
effects and the far-reaching results
of the rushing system one must
come to concrete, individual cases.
There was not a new girl in Ro
ble who was not in some way af
fected. It was the culmination of
intimations and whisperings and
inferences which had surounded her
all fall quarter. With the lifting of
the taboo, she could talk openly
about what every girl had thought
of for three months. The mere
rules of the relations of row and
new women during the fall quarter
had over-emphasized the impor
tance of the problem.
It would probably be unfair to
say that new women choose their
friends with an eye to their house
connections or possibilities. But. it
is admitted that, consciously or not,
this does influence their estimation
and evaluation of the girls with
whom they are living.
In the following list of effects and
results of rushing, an attempt has

been made to give representative
examples which will give a pic- ;

great disadvantage, because the '
sororities prefer to pledge fresh
men. Since the number of trans
fers is increasing from year to year,
their predicament is a growing
problem.
New women who are lacking in
the social graces — the very ones j
who would benefit most by the i
training a sorority provides — are J
the ones most often overlooked in
rushing. A sorority is not a welfare
bureau; it cannot afford to take
girls who are socially backward. As
a result, these girls are made to
feel their social inferiority even
more, and this reaction impedes 1
their normal social development. It
seems hardly fair that an educa- '
tional institution, suposedly de
signed to develop the fullest capa- j

cities of all the students, should
give them a rating at the beginning
of their callege career that is so
categorical.
:j. Over-emphasis of the social
For a sorority to maintain its
position of social prestige on the'
campus, it is necessary that it stress '
rather trivial superficialities —at the j
expense of the more fundamental
aims of college life. A sorority must I
make a good appearance before the;
campus in general, and the new
women in particular. The group
interest of the sorority is focused on
"getting a class." With the energy
of the group directed at this goal,
the real purposes of college are ob
scured. And this perversion of val
ues affects not only the sorority
women but also others who, being
impressed by the social prestige of
the sorority women, follow the ex
ample that they set.
4. Limitation of associations
It is essentially true that a soro
rity limits the friendships of its
members. While it is obvious that j
I here can be, and sometimes are, j
close friendships between members j
of different houses, or between Row |
women and Hall women, still it is I
apparent that the bulk of close |
friendships are formed within a 1
house. This is only a natural result
of the fact that a girl chooses her ,
friends from among those who are !
most often with her. A freshman i
girl, at an extremely plastic and !
formative age, is asked to select— j
on such an unnatural basis as rush- j
ing parties—one group with whom !
she will live during the remainder |
of her college life.
A college includes many varied
types of girls, and each girl should i
be able to choose her friends from :
all types with equal freedom. Dur
ing her four years of college she •
should be able to select her friends '
without the influence of sorority j
grouping.
5. Hindrance to the social-educative
program of the University
An individual sorority house, be
cause it is a part of a national or- '
ganization, cannot be an integral ,
part of the University residence
system. When a disciplinary case \
arises in a sorority, that sorority is
likely to depend upon the authority ;
of the national organization to
which it belongs, instead of sub- j
mitting the case to A.W.S. officials. |
These sororities, then, practice a
sort of extra-legal autonomy; and
under these circumstances it is im
possible for A.W.S. officials to main- !
tain a uniform enforcement of so- |

cial regulations.
Because the individual sorority
must compete with other sororities
in the race for prestige, a sorority
is obliged to keep its problems se
cret. Without this factor, the so
rorities could benefit by an inter
change of suggestions.
The work of the University in
creating a spirit of citizenship in
the freshman dormitory has been
impeded by the pledging and initia
tion of freshmen. These freshmen
give their first consideration to the
sorority and lose interest in the
affairs of the dormitory.
The work of the University in
character building has been mate
rially hindered by the division of
women into the groups, selected and
unselected. It is detrimental to a
student's emotional adjustment to
have a consciousness either of su
periority or inferiority, to have the
complacency of smugness, or Ihe
bitterness of social bewilderment.
(5. Artificial grouping
The presence of sororities on the
campus creates two distinct classes
—Row and Hall. Until this i year
those groups have been approxi
mately equal in number. Next year
there will be about 27 per cent Row
and 73 per cent Hall. In the very
restriction of proportionate num
bers the Row will become more se
lective, more exclusive, and more
enviable. This situation will pro
duce a breach between the two
groups that will hinder the tradi
tional spirit of Stanford democracy.
The sorority system does not ex
press the spirit of the present; it is
a system that looks to the past for
its excuse for being and the pattern
of its form.
7. Rushing (its effects and condi
tions as taken primarily from
Roblc this year).
Any person living in Roble dur
ing the last rushing period and who
was in a position to know what was
happening can describe it as nothing
less than completely emotional.
Even to an old girl, who was less
affected than any other member in
the hall, the high state of nervous
tension was apparent.
There is no question that during
this time studying was neglected
and| the regular routine entirely
disrupted. Bull sessions at all hours,
disregard for all quiet hours, and
continuous speculation and thought
on one subject reversed the condi
tions of ordinary living. The sense
of balance and values was com
pletely distorted.
These were outward manifesta
tions of what was happening; they
would have been apparent even to
a visitor. However, to realize the
effects and the far-reaching results
of the rushing system one must
come to concrete, individual cases.
There was not a new girl in Ro
ble who was not in some way af
fected. It was the culmination of
intimations and whisperings and
inferences which had surounded her
all fall quarter. With the lifting of
the taboo, she could talk openly
about what every girl had thought
of for three months. The mere
rules of the relations of row and
new women during the fall quarter
had over-emphasized the impor
tance of the problem.
It would probably be unfair to
say that new women choose their
friends with an eye to their house
connections or possibilities. But. it
is admitted that, consciously or not,
this does influence their estimation
and evaluation of the girls with
whom they are living.
In the following list of effects and
results of rushing, an attempt has

been made to give representative
examples which will give a pic- ;
ture of the whole.
1. This year there were girls who
received no invitations at all, or
only one or two. The first reaction
in that, case was to build up a de- '
fense, to show everyone else that
they didn't care. But in reality,
there was a turn to self-analysis,
to ask the question, "What is the
matter with me?"
2. In direct contrast with these ;
girls were those who had to do the i
eliminating instead of the houses.
Their mixed feelings of exultation :
and elation were often unfounded.
Disappointments later in the week
were harder than they would have
been in the beginning.
But all of these girls were not
disappointed, and uncertain though
they were, they were already
stamped with a superiority which
is never mentioned but often felt. |
Under this grouping also comes i
the girl who couldn't decide, even 1
up to pledge night. Her own state
of emotion and the effect of it on
others is difficult to estimate, but
certainly far-reaching.
3. There were many who were not
rushed by the house which they
wanted, and so refused all invita
tions with fatal resignation. Their
decision was complete. The major
ity of these girls will probably be
very happy in dormitories, but
their adjustment to college life in a
hall in contrast to their plan for it
in a sorority will not be immediate.
And it will take more than a few
months before they will be able to
have an unprejudiced attitude to
ward the girls in the house which
did not take them.
4. There are always those who
join a house for the sole sake of j
going vow. The unhappiness of
these girls while making a decision
is only the beginning of three years'
unhappiness in a second - choice
group. 4
If more detailed cases were given,
as they could be, the illustrations
would show unpleasantness and in
justice.
To see truly what happens dur
ing a rushing season, to conceive
its immediate and ultimate effects
as they have been this year and as
they will be next year, is to be
convinced that in them alone is jus
tification for the abolition of the
sorority system.
Tine culmination of more than
two months' investigation of the
Stanford sorority system by the
A.W.S. commission organized for
this purpose comes in the report j
printed below. This report is not j
an affair brought up by the ad- ,
ministration. It was initiated by j
students; the work on it was done j
by students; and the final judgment
of it will be up to the students, ac- !
cording to the commission.
The commission has endeavored
to present a fair, unbiased consid
eration of the matter and will put i
the question to the rest of the cam- '
pus next week.
PREFACE
A.W.S. Sorority Commission Report
The A.W.S. sorority commission, '
representing all groups of the campus ;
for the purpose of impartial investi
gation and discussion of the so- |
rority system. The results were to j
be tabulated in a single report.
This was not possible. The only
method of procedure which the
commission could take was to have j
one group present disadvantages, j
the other advantages.
As it is submitted, the report is
in two parts. Each part was written j
by a group of volunteers who j
wanted to present one side. The i
result is a report of two expressions j
of opinion. No statement on the
list either of assets or liabilities is j
to be construed as representative
of a conclusion reached by the ;
whole commission.
ADVANTAGES
1. People love organizations. Like i
will flock together in clubs. It is
better to have organized fraternity |
groups under control than miscel
laneous independent clubs. Snob
bishness exists in social cliques i
more intensively than in fraterni
ties and has no tangible center in
the latter which can be attached. |
2. The fraternity fosters friend- i
ships. One can be friends only with
a limited number. There are dan- '
gers of forgetting college's oppor
tunity for friendship if one tries to '
know equally well all of a large '
student body.
3. The fraternity brings together
girls of varied tastes and activities
so Ihat it is broader than a de
partment club. Fraternity encour- '
ages the appreciation of all lines of
scholarship and forms bonds of con
geniality bigger than the interest
in one's individual affairs or that i
found in social cliques based on the '
Similarity of interests.
4. The fraternity stands for the
best college ideals. It is a group
unit through which it is easy to
reach and influence individual stu
dents. Its close relationships make
possible a stronger influence on the
individual than faculty or dormi
tory alone can have. As a group a
chapter can more effectively for
ward college activities than can
girls working individually.
5. The national charter in a fra
rnity broadens the viewpoint be
cause of its interest in and appre
ciation for other colegcs. Thereby
it counteracts the prevailing pro
vincialism and egotism of most
campuses. This contact with other
colleges gives the fraternity woman
contact and a possibility for friend
-1 lip throughout the country.
6. The fraternity holds the inter
est of alutnnae and keeps them in
touch v/ith college, its work and
its needs, and brings them back for
visits.
7. The fraternity stands for high
scholarship and helps members to
('') good consistent work. For these
reasons study tables have been es
tablished in the houses and a grade
rating set up to be met by pros
pective members.
6. The fraternity recognizes that
intellectual pursuits are not the
only thing necessary to develop
womanly citizens. r rhe size of stu
dent bodies and modern educational
methods make it impossible for a
college to do much for students
outside the class room. Fraternities
give members the development and
training found in the cohesive or
ganization of an Oxford college.
Through chapter social activities
id support of college enterprises,
fraternities extend in a measure this
same sort of help to the rest of
the student body.
9. Close friendships and a com
munity of interests in a chapter de
velop unselfishness, adaptability, co
operation, tact, honor, and in it ia
i ve. In the student body many a
student's talent atrophies and her
initiative power remains undevel
oped because there are no demands
for its exercise upon every student,
while in a fraternity each girl mem
ber must carry her share of work,
activity, and responsibility.
10. As part of a national organi
zation with high ideals a chapter
must strive to represent its fra
ternity well. It is constantly urged
to appreciate its duty as an orga
nized member of the community.
This, with the chapter's opportuni
ties for service and hospitality to
students and friends, encourages in
vvery member tolerance, generosity,
a sense of personal responsibility,
thoughtfulness, consideration for
others, and interest in a world be
yond one's own door.
11. Chapter fellowship gives
pleasure to individuals and encour
ages each one to make the most of
./ne's self without forgetting one's
obligations not to advance at the
expense of others. Growth comes
through pleasure as well as through
work, so this companionship means
much at the time.
12. Chapter life with its duties
and responsibility more nearly ap
roaches home life than does any
dormitory plan.
13. The test of college organiza
tion is: does it advance or hinder
ihe real object of college? Does it
make for higher or lower scholar
ship? Investigations and reports on
universities commend fraternity
bapters for help along both these
Jines.
14. Fraternities give pleasure to
members, college and alumnae. In
zeal for the good of the whole, one
group should not be denied the
right of its own happiness. <
15. The fraternity has become
nore of a living group than a se
cret society, for it is recognized that
all are based upon the identical
principles of truth, honor, friend
ship, and loyalty. The difference
among the fraternities is merely in
the varied manner or procedure of
initiation ceremonies, in order to
impress their members with the
.significance of these ideals.
Hi. The process of selecting new
members for (he fraternity is one
open 1o change and is an existing
evil which can be minimized or
completely eliminated by a com
mon sense revision of the present
rushing system and rules. Many
J: the objections to the fraternity
system are objections merely to the
existing rushing system found at
Stanford rather than inherent dis
advantages of the fraternity itself.
And we feel that the time could be
more profitably spent in formulat
ing a plan for the reorganization
t rushing rather than the abolition
of sororities.

DISADVANTAGES
1. The burden of rushing on the
sorority women
The intensive effort required for
a successful season of rushing can
not help taking its toll from the
sorority women. The weeks of ac
tual rushing demand a great deal of
time and energy. It is well known
that scholarship takes a drop dur
ing this period; and women who
try to meet the requirements of
regular academic work as well as
the requirements of rushing often
find their health impaired. There
is also a financial burden. The av
erage sorority member contributes
seventeen dollars for each rushing
season — even with the simplest
standards of entertaihment that
Pan-Hellenic can devise.
During this time of highly or
ganized entertaining, the sorority
women must be selecting the
"class." This is an extremely diffi
cult task; for unless the sorority is
a distinct type, there must inevi
tably be differences of opinion in
this selection. Many unfortunate
incidents occur, such as angry dis
agreements between sorority mem
bers, the disappointment of the
sorority member whose freshman
friend is "dinged"' by her sorority,
the interference of alumnae who
insist upon the sorority's taking a
certain freshman that the sorority
does not want, and so on.
But the really insidious thing
about rushing is that it is not con
fined to the period of entertainment
—it is going on all the time. Dur
ing the summer, the sorority women
are busy getting acquainted with,
if not actually rushing, the enter
ing women near their homes. Dur
ing fall quarter they are careful to
make a good impression on the
freshmen, and upon those who j
might influence them. The sorority |
women are expected to learn the
names of as many freshmen as
they can, and to cultivate the ac- !
quaintance of any who are likely !
to be rushees. This was reasonably
possible when there were fewer j
than a hundred freshmen, but with J
over two hundred it becomes an |
almost hopeless task.
2. Hardships to special groups of
women
The cruel discrimination against
some girls is unjustifiable, and in !
an educational institution of today
almost unbelievable. Certain girls
often come to college unaware that !
they are not eligible for rushing, j
because of a circumstance which is i
completely beyond their control.
There are legacies who do not
happen to be just the sort of girl
the house wants. They are keenly i
disappointed if they are not bid, '
but they are in a much worse posi
tion when they are. And legacies
who do happen to be just the sort •
of girl the house wants often won- 1
der whether they were bid only
because of their connections.
Transfers who have previously af
filiated with a national sorority
having a local chapter are in much
the same situation, with the added
condition of almost irrevocable
membership in a distant chapter 1
that prevents them from joining a
congenial group on this campus.
Transfers who have previously af
filiated with a national sorority not
having a local chapter are deprived
even of that one chance to join a
congenial group. Even transfers
who have not previously affiliated
with a national sorority are at a
great disadvantage, because the '
sororities prefer to pledge fresh
men. Since the number of trans
fers is increasing from year to year,
their predicament is a growing
problem.
New women who are lacking in
the social graces — the very ones j
who would benefit most by the i
training a sorority provides — are J
the ones most often overlooked in
rushing. A sorority is not a welfare
bureau; it cannot afford to take
girls who are socially backward. As
a result, these girls are made to
feel their social inferiority even
more, and this reaction impedes 1
their normal social development. It
seems hardly fair that an educa- '
tional institution, suposedly de
signed to develop the fullest capa- j

cities of all the students, should
give them a rating at the beginning
of their callege career that is so
categorical.
:j. Over-emphasis of the social
For a sorority to maintain its
position of social prestige on the'
campus, it is necessary that it stress '
rather trivial superficialities —at the j
expense of the more fundamental
aims of college life. A sorority must I
make a good appearance before the;

girl, at an extremely plastic and !

she will live during the remainder |
of her college life.
A college includes many varied
types of girls, and each girl should i
be able to choose her friends from :
all types with equal freedom. Dur
ing her four years of college she •
should be able to select her friends '
without the influence of sorority j
grouping.
5. Hindrance to the social-educative
program of the University
An individual sorority house, be
cause it is a part of a national or- '
