### 
Tine culmination of more than
two months' investigation of the
Stanford sorority system by the
A.W.S. commission organized for
this purpose comes in the report j
printed below. This report is not j
an affair brought up by the ad- ,
ministration. It was initiated by j
students; the work on it was done j
by students; and the final judgment
of it will be up to the students, ac- !
cording to the commission.
The commission has endeavored
to present a fair, unbiased consid
eration of the matter and will put i
the question to the rest of the cam- '
pus next week.
PREFACE
A.W.S. Sorority Commission Report
The A.W.S. sorority commission, '
representing all groups of the campus ;
for the purpose of impartial investi
gation and discussion of the so- |
rority system. The results were to j
be tabulated in a single report.
This was not possible. The only
method of procedure which the
commission could take was to have j
one group present disadvantages, j
the other advantages.
As it is submitted, the report is
in two parts. Each part was written j
by a group of volunteers who j
wanted to present one side. The i
result is a report of two expressions j
of opinion. No statement on the
list either of assets or liabilities is j
to be construed as representative
of a conclusion reached by the ;
whole commission.
ADVANTAGES
1. People love organizations. Like i
will flock together in clubs. It is
better to have organized fraternity |
groups under control than miscel
laneous independent clubs. Snob
bishness exists in social cliques i
more intensively than in fraterni
ties and has no tangible center in
the latter which can be attached. |
2. The fraternity fosters friend- i
ships. One can be friends only with
a limited number. There are dan- '
gers of forgetting college's oppor
tunity for friendship if one tries to '
know equally well all of a large '
student body.
3. The fraternity brings together
girls of varied tastes and activities
so Ihat it is broader than a de
partment club. Fraternity encour- '
ages the appreciation of all lines of
scholarship and forms bonds of con
geniality bigger than the interest
in one's individual affairs or that i
found in social cliques based on the '
Similarity of interests.
4. The fraternity stands for the
best college ideals. It is a group
unit through which it is easy to
reach and influence individual stu
dents. Its close relationships make
possible a stronger influence on the
