# Farm Awaits Water Show
## Annual Junior Carnival Will Begin at 2 O'clock 
### 
Last minute compilation of entry
lists indicated that perennal cham
pions of the deep, Alpha Delta Phi
and Alpha Phi, might meet defeat
in the class of 1935's Junior Water
Carnival today.
Rumored to excel all previous i
Carnivals in variety, humor, and I
excitement, this afternoon's aquatic ;
show begins at 2 o'clock in Encina i
Pool. Admission is free, with stu
dents and alumni expected to fill
the pool grandstand long before
King McClure and Queen Harris
of (he "Kingdom of Hell" are given
their amphibian crowns by King
Leo Cook Neptune at five minutes
after 2 o'clock.

Fraternity, sorority, and club
teams will compete for two mam
moth irophiea purchased by the
junior class. Merchandise prizes do
nated by Palo Alto retainers will
be given winners of individual
events. The two trophies will be
awarded at the end of the meet,
while smaller prizes will be pre
sented at the conclusion of each
event.
So many entry blanks were re
ceived yesterday that it was neces
sary to select entrants by draw in
certain events. Expert Junior Wa
ter Carnival commentators, though
looking forward chiefly to the Clas
sic of the Century and other com
edy events, are of the opinion that
the men's canoe tilting and the
women's 50-yard free style races
are crucial events in the fight for
the Carnival Trophies. Entry lists
are printed on page 3.
Music will be provided by the
Stanford band.
