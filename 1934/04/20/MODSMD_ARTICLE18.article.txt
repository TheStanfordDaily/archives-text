# Card Debate Team Meets U.C. Tonight
## Kay Participates in NBC Hookup Saturday 
### 
When Rollin Woodbury, Austin
Fife, and Spencer Thompson meet 1
three University of California stu
dents in the Joffre debate tonight at
8 o'clock at Berkeley, it will be the
twelfth time Stanford has competed
with U.C. for the "Medaille Joffre."
It was in 1894 that Baron Pierre
de Coubertin offered, in honor of
Sadi Carnot, martyred president of
France, an award known as the
"Medaille Carnot."
In 1917 this award was changed to
the "Medaille Joffre," in honor of
the French hero, Marshall Joffre.
Since then the Cardinal representa
tives have won the medal for Stan
ford 9 out of 11 times, according to
Lee Chapin, Stanford debate ad
visor.
Last year Mary-Katherine Morris
brought the award back to the Farm
with Bromley Smith and Wayne l
Bannister taking second and third
places respectively in the competi
tion.
Early this spring Woodbury dis
tinguished himself by winning the
Pacific Coast Forensic League ex
temporaneous speaking contest. He
has participated in many major and
minor speaking activities while on
the campus and was on the debating
team which toured Canada last fall,
winning a decision over University
of British Columbia debaters.
Fife, although a senior, as is
Woodbury, is relatively new to Stan
ford, transferring from Utah last
fall. Hp has, however, participated
in a few Stanford debates and is
well informed on the subject of the
Joffre debate, "France and Social
ism," having lived in that country
for two years.
A junior student, Thompson has
been active in the debating depart
ment while in school, participating
in minor and major debates, and
taking the tour of Southern Cali
fornia with a Stanford team last
year.
On Saturday morning Woodbury,
Thompson, Henry Lowenstein, and
William Kuzell are scheduled to
debate in San Jose. Later in the
day a Stanford debater, Ronald
Kay, will go on the air over a trans
continental hookup of NBC with
teammates from U.S.C. and Uni
versity of Washington to debate an
All-East team composed of Colum
bia, Yale, and Princeton men. The
program is a feature sponsored by
NBC and will take place from 11 to
2 o'clock Saturday afternoon.
The Western team is being
coached by Dr. Alan Nichols, vet
eran debate coach from the Uni
versity of Southern California.
