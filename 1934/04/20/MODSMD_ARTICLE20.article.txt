# CARDS FAVORED OVER BEARS BY ELEVEN POINTS
## Both Teams in Excellent Shape; Captain Gus Meier Counted on for Two Hurdle Victories; Stanford Strong in Weights 
### JACK DROWN 
In what promises to be the closest Big Meet is nearly a decade, but with
Stanford reigning a slight favorite to win. Coach Dink Templeton's Card
track and field performers face Brutus Hamilton's California spikesters
tomorrow afternoon in the Stanford Stadium in the forty-first annual con -
test between the two institutions.
Opening events will be the javelin and shot-put which commence
promptly at 1:45 o'clock and will be followed by the first track event, the
mile run, at 2 o'clock sharp.

► Both teams are in excellent condi
: tion. Stanford's Captain Gus Meier,
who sojourned for several days in
; the Staniord. Hospital in order to in
i sure his well-being for the contest,
was dismissed yesterday morning
and appears to be in good condition.
Meier is counted upon for two Stan
lord firsts, being slated to cop the
high and low hurdle races.
Anderson May Place
Arne Anderson, Card vautter, who
met with an unfortunate spike in
jury the first part of the week, will
probably be released from the Stan
i lord Hospital this morning, and some
! of the dopesters are picking Arne to
break through the California trio of
Vantress, Mauger, and Haskell for
a place in the vault, the three Bear
scalers being generally conceded to
finish in order below Stanford's great
Bud Deacon, who is capable of bet
ter than 14 feet.
Stanford's decided superiority in
the weights events is one reason the
Cards have been named a slight fa
' vorite to annex the contest. How
ever, the Cards will need to amass
j every point that John Lyman and
Slinger Dunn can give them in the
discus and shot, as well as Johnny
Mottram's cinch first in the javelin,
to offset the tremendous power Cali
fornia possesses in the broad jump.
Lyman a Cinch
Lyman should easily win the shot,
being capable of heaving the iron
ball over 52 feet any time he feels
like it, while Slinger Dunn can and
should toss the 16-pound pellet past
the 50-foot mark. In the discus, if
Dunn regains some of his last year's
form and forgets his "fouling pho
bia," the big fellow may sling the
platter near the 160-foot outpost,
while Lyman has at least a 145-foot
toss in his system, which should be
iar enough to defeat the Bear's
Wood, who is stiil suffering slightly
from a sore arm.
One Javelin Place
The Farm's premier javelin tossor
of all time, Johnny Mottram, ought
to have little trouble in winning his
specialty. Mottram has consistently
thrown the steel-pointed oversized
toothpick beyond 200 feet and has
one mark to his credit of 220 feet
10",s inches. Fitzgerald and Mackey
of California should place second
and third, respectively, unless Beat
tv of the Cards, who was nearing the
200-foot mark until he injured his
arm several weeks ago, regains some
of his old-time form.
The broad jump, however, is a
very different story, and is all in the
Bear's favor. Bob Clark, Califor
i nia's great leaper, has a record of
| 24 feet 5 3 j inches made this season
and Micelii and Treadwell, his team
mates, both have marks near the
24-foot line. Such prowess will
probably too much for the
