# CARDS FAVORED OVER BEARS BY ELEVEN POINTS
## Both Teams in Excellent Shape; Captain Gus Meier Counted on for Two Hurdle Victories; Stanford Strong in Weights 
### JACK DROWN 
In what promises to be the closest Big Meet is nearly a decade, but with
Stanford reigning a slight favorite to win. Coach Dink Templeton's Card
track and field performers face Brutus Hamilton's California spikesters
tomorrow afternoon in the Stanford Stadium in the forty-first annual con -
test between the two institutions.
Opening events will be the javelin and shot-put which commence
promptly at 1:45 o'clock and will be followed by the first track event, the
mile run, at 2 o'clock sharp.

► Both teams are in excellent condi
: tion. Stanford's Captain Gus Meier,
who sojourned for several days in
; the Staniord. Hospital in order to in
i sure his well-being for the contest,
was dismissed yesterday morning
and appears to be in good condition.
Meier is counted upon for two Stan
lord firsts, being slated to cop the
high and low hurdle races.
Anderson May Place
Arne Anderson, Card vautter, who
met with an unfortunate spike in
jury the first part of the week, will
probably be released from the Stan
i lord Hospital this morning, and some
! of the dopesters are picking Arne to
break through the California trio of
Vantress, Mauger, and Haskell for
a place in the vault, the three Bear
scalers being generally conceded to
finish in order below Stanford's great
Bud Deacon, who is capable of bet
ter than 14 feet.
Stanford's decided superiority in
the weights events is one reason the
Cards have been named a slight fa
' vorite to annex the contest. How
ever, the Cards will need to amass
j every point that John Lyman and
Slinger Dunn can give them in the
discus and shot, as well as Johnny
Mottram's cinch first in the javelin,
to offset the tremendous power Cali
fornia possesses in the broad jump.
Lyman a Cinch
Lyman should easily win the shot,
being capable of heaving the iron
ball over 52 feet any time he feels
like it, while Slinger Dunn can and
should toss the 16-pound pellet past
the 50-foot mark. In the discus, if
Dunn regains some of his last year's
form and forgets his "fouling pho
bia," the big fellow may sling the
platter near the 160-foot outpost,
while Lyman has at least a 145-foot
toss in his system, which should be
iar enough to defeat the Bear's
Wood, who is stiil suffering slightly
from a sore arm.
One Javelin Place
The Farm's premier javelin tossor
of all time, Johnny Mottram, ought
to have little trouble in winning his
specialty. Mottram has consistently
thrown the steel-pointed oversized
toothpick beyond 200 feet and has
one mark to his credit of 220 feet
10",s inches. Fitzgerald and Mackey
of California should place second
and third, respectively, unless Beat
tv of the Cards, who was nearing the
200-foot mark until he injured his
arm several weeks ago, regains some
of his old-time form.
The broad jump, however, is a
very different story, and is all in the
Bear's favor. Bob Clark, Califor
i nia's great leaper, has a record of
| 24 feet 5 3 j inches made this season
and Micelii and Treadwell, his team
mates, both have marks near the
24-foot line. Such prowess will
probably too much for the
, Indian contestants, Phil Williams and
: Paul Zac'hes, who have yet to reach
' 23 feet this season.
Nimmo vs. Raftery
The mile run should produce one
I of the prettiest races of the day.
j Charley Nimmo, the sensational,
; Stanford sophomore, who has run
! 4:22.9 this year, and Red Raftery of
; the Bears meet over the grueling
1 four-lap grind in a contest which
; should decide the Coast mile su
' premacy. Raftery will be running in
| his last Big Meet and will give all he
: has, while little Nimmo is also being
! counted upon to break up the Cali
| fornia monopoly in the 880 so capa
: bly managed by Dick Brace, Captain
Llye Reynolds, and Clark Nicker
son, all of whom have been clocked
in better than 1:58.
However, Chuck, with his marve
lous recuperative powers, will not
lay back in the mile to save himself
for the shorter race, but will be out
to win, and the fact that he clicked
| off a 1:56.2 half this week affords
; him a better chance than ever to
j after nearly passing out following
j a half-mile race. Ben Eastman took
part in three events for two years,
J giving up his chance to set the rec
ords of which he was capable, and
then in his third year when he was
set to go out and craCk them, pulled
jp lame a couple of weeks before
the meet.
By winning last year at Berkeley,
Stanford established a new record
for consecutive wins, having taken
ten meets in a row. If the Indians
win today it will be their eleventh
■ consecutive win and their twenty
i third victory since 1893. *

1 place in the half even after he has
run a sapping mile.
Records Expected
In the two short sprints, specta
tors may witness the establishing of I
one and possibly two new world'." i
records. "Bullet Bob'' Kiesel, great- i
Jest sprinter in Bear track history, j
I according to his coach, Brutus Ham
| ilton, never has really uncorked this
! season. Although the blond Cali
! fornia star has a 9.5 hundred and
20.8 220 to his credit, the marks
being made earlier this year, Hamil
j ton believes that Kiesel is capable of j
20 flat or at least 20.2 in the longer
! race and possibly 9.2 or 9.3 in the
century.
I If weather conditions are right and
l "Bullet Bob" feels that the time is
I ripe, one and possibly two world ;
marks may be erased from the books !
j tomorrow afternoon. At least the
Boars should pick up 10 valuable I
' points here. Stanford should garner J
| an additional five points in the quar
ter-mile with Al Blackman, 47.8 run
ner, leading Leek and Street of the
j Berkeley institution to the tape.
Two Ihirdlc Places
I A great sophomore hurdler, Sam
i Klopstock should contribute six
points to the Stanford cause, taking
seconds to Captain Meier in both
races. Sam has run the highs in 14.6.
last Saturday leading Gus to the 1

tape, while 23.9 has been his best
time for the longer race, and it
should be good enough to give him
a second place over Coe or Charvet
of the opposition.
The two-mile appears to be Berk
eley bound, with Fowler, who has
consistently broken 9.50 taking the
event, followed by his teammate,
Reynolds, with Art Azevedo of the
Cards taking a possible third.
High .lump a Toss-up
The high jump looks like a toss
up. Howie Arthur and Lloyd
Schween of the Stanford team and
Hugh Thompson of California all
have marks of 6 feet 1 inch or bet
ter. Arthur has done one inch 1 bet
ter this season and Thompson dupli
cated his feat in the Califoraia-S.C.
meet, while Schween has yet to clear
the heights that he attained last year,
when he leaped 6 feet 4 inches on
one occasion. The least that Stanford
should obtain would be a tie for
first and third place.
The mile relay, the last event of
the day, appears to be very, very
close, but Templeton's bo#s, with Al
Blackman running anchor should
win.

Songs are still used in treating
the sick by medicine men of the
Seminole Indians of Florida.
