# Women Students Act
## 
### 
Willi the presentation today of the findings of the
A.W.S. commission on sororities, the campus has the op
portunity to show former Stanford men and women what
is being done in the way of constructive thoughtâ€”without
outside influences.
Originated bv the women students, investigated by
the women students, and to be decided by the women
students, the expression is an important move along the
lines of clear thinking and intelligent action. II is directly
in step with the administration's attitude of "let the stu
dents guide their own affairs."
The Daily trusts that the final decision will be one
based on the best interests of Stanford. At a later date,
ii is possible that the Daily will take a stand, but not until
all issues are made clear.
