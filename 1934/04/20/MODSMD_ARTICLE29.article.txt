# WHY IT'S NEWS
## Another Arms Crisis 
### CROMPTON BANGS, Jr 
Another European crisis is appar
ently at hand. The situation is this:
Germany has demanded the right to
rearm; France absolutely refuses to
allow this unless her security is
guaranteed. As the one power which
can effectively give this guarantee,
England is placed in a very awkward
position.
The trouble started when a note
sent by Germany to England was
made public. It set forth in no un
certain terms just what the Nazis'
military ambitions were. Briefly,
they are: the immediate doubling of
Germany's armaments; equality with
any power in five years—especially
in the air. What does this mean?
The Triangle
In Germany the publication of this
news simply means that something
long contemplated as a necessary
part of the Nazi program has been
definitely stated. There is likewise
no doubt that re-armament is well
under way; Germany's arms bud
gets were nearly doubled this year.
For France the publication of the
note meant the breaking off of the
disarmament talks with Germany.
On the other hand, France's stand is
Jo be expected. With what is per
haps the strongest cabinet in her
history, and the growing popular de
mand for a more definite stand
against German re - armament,
France's action is widely supported
at home.
Thus it was only natural for the
French to insist upon rigid obser
vance of the Versailles Treaty by
Germany. This is most unlikely.
France's only alternatives arc the
strengthening of her central Euro
pean allies, and guarantees of her se
curity by some strong powers. The
government absolutely insists upon
these two things before allowing
Germany to re-arm. Whether this
will stop Germany is another ques
tion.
The Outcome
England is the most interesting
corner of the triangle. Faced by a
more and more belligerent Germany,
too close to Belgium and Holland for
comfort, the British are seriously
considering possible concessions to
the French demand for security. This
demand is a historic one, as is Eng
land's position as regards a too ag
gressive Germany. Thus it is barely
possible the British will again yield
to the historical facts and throw in
their jot with France.
The re-armament of Germany—
which cannot be prevented, and the
increases in armaments by other
powers do not mean that a war is
iikely to occur in the near future.
What these facts do mean is that the
League of Nations system of mutual
peace guarantees against aggression
is not yet definitely established in
Europe. In its stead—or supplement
ing it—a re-alignment of forces—
with Germany resuming the place of
a great power—is taking place. It's
the balance of power al! over again.

the balance of power al! over again.
Another European crisis is appar
ently at hand. The situation is this:
Germany has demanded the right to
rearm; France absolutely refuses to
allow this unless her security is
guaranteed. As the one power which
can effectively give this guarantee,
England is placed in a very awkward
position.
The trouble started when a note
sent by Germany to England was
made public. It set forth in no un
certain terms just what the Nazis'
military ambitions were. Briefly,
they are: the immediate doubling of
Germany's armaments; equality with
any power in five years—especially
in the air. What does this mean?
The Triangle
In Germany the publication of this
news simply means that something
long contemplated as a necessary
part of the Nazi program has been
definitely stated. There is likewise
no doubt that re-armament is well
under way; Germany's arms bud
gets were nearly doubled this year.
For France the publication of the
note meant the breaking off of the
disarmament talks with Germany.
On the other hand, France's stand is
Jo be expected. With what is per
haps the strongest cabinet in her
history, and the growing popular de
mand for a more definite stand
against German re - armament,
France's action is widely supported
at home.
Thus it was only natural for the
French to insist upon rigid obser
vance of the Versailles Treaty by
Germany. This is most unlikely.
France's only alternatives arc the
strengthening of her central Euro
pean allies, and guarantees of her se
curity by some strong powers. The
government absolutely insists upon
these two things before allowing
Germany to re-arm. Whether this
will stop Germany is another ques
tion.
The Outcome
England is the most interesting
corner of the triangle. Faced by a
more and more belligerent Germany,
too close to Belgium and Holland for
comfort, the British are seriously
considering possible concessions to
the French demand for security. This
demand is a historic one, as is Eng
land's position as regards a too ag
gressive Germany. Thus it is barely
possible the British will again yield
to the historical facts and throw in
their jot with France.
The re-armament of Germany—
which cannot be prevented, and the
increases in armaments by other
powers do not mean that a war is
iikely to occur in the near future.
What these facts do mean is that the
League of Nations system of mutual
peace guarantees against aggression
is not yet definitely established in
Europe. In its stead—or supplement
ing it—a re-alignment of forces—
with Germany resuming the place of
a great power—is taking place. It's
the balance of power al! over again.
