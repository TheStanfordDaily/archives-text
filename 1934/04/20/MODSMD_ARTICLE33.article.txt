LONG-LOST FATHER (Radio)
At the Varsity Theatre
John Barrymore occasionally acts
in very good pictures and occasion
ally amuses himself in very bad
ones; this picture falls distinctly
into the latter category. The story
is a stream-lined model of the old
tear-jerker about the father who
sacrifices himself to save his daugh
ter's honor. The plot in its modern
version loses most of the tears with
out gaining much in plausibility. To
rehearse it in detail would be a
waste of space.
With this material the cast does
surprisingly well; brilliance is not
required, nor is it forthcoming. John
Barrymore and Helen Chandler, in
the only two roles that matter, nobly
resisted temptations to overplay
either for sentiment or for burlesque,
though the material gave opportu
nity for both. Of the other charac
ters, Alan Mowbray deserves credit
for fine character work. And the
director deserves credit for keeping
the picture moving on its thin plot,
and for not making it very long.

"Empire in the East." Edited by
Joseph Barnes.
Doublcday Doran & Co., Inc., New
York. (Stanford Bookstore Lib.)
This volume contains a series of
10 studies of those Asiatic coun
tries adjacent to the Pacific basin:

China, Japan, and Russia. Each of
the 10 parts I<> the book comes from
a different pen, and represents a
specialized phase of post-War Asia,
such as religious, economic, and mil
itary problems, and international re
lations.
The purpose of the publication is
to present to Western eyes a clearer |
insight into the current Far Eastern
problems which are perplexing
statesmen. The contributors are ,
students of note on the Orient: Owen
Lattimore, Joseph Barnes, F. V.
Field, Carl L. Alsberg, Tyler Den
nett, J. E. Orchard, Grover Clark,
H. F. Bain, Pearl S. Buck, and Na
thaniel Pcffer.
The editor, Joseph Barnes, was
editor of the Harvary Daily "Crim
son" about a decade ago, and has
gained since then considerable rep
utation as an interpreter of inter
national affairs.
The contributions of Professor Ty
ler Dennett on Far Eastern diplo
macy and Dr. Carl L. Alsberg on
"The Struggle for Food" easily stand j
above the rest both in content and
style. Dr. Alsberg's position at
Stanford as head of the Food Re
search Institute for the past decade
has given him ample opportunity to ;
study the food problems of the Pa
cific basin.
Each of the studies contrasts the
pre-war Orient of the "Pax Britan
nica" era with that of today. We
find here an Asia whose future will
be that predominantly of an ag
ricultural economy; we see Japan's i
side of the Manchurian picture; we
find newly revised statistics of ori
ental resources, which, with their
specialized interpretation, cannot fail
to add to one's better understanding
of the Far Eastern situation.

such as religious, economic, and mil
itary problems, and international re
lations.
The purpose of the publication is
to present to Western eyes a clearer |
insight into the current Far Eastern
problems which are perplexing
statesmen. The contributors are ,
students of note on the Orient: Owen
Lattimore, Joseph Barnes, F. V.
Field, Carl L. Alsberg, Tyler Den
nett, J. E. Orchard, Grover Clark,
H. F. Bain, Pearl S. Buck, and Na
thaniel Pcffer.
The editor, Joseph Barnes, was
editor of the Harvary Daily "Crim
son" about a decade ago, and has
gained since then considerable rep
utation as an interpreter of inter
national affairs.
The contributions of Professor Ty
ler Dennett on Far Eastern diplo
macy and Dr. Carl L. Alsberg on
"The Struggle for Food" easily stand j
above the rest both in content and
style. Dr. Alsberg's position at
Stanford as head of the Food Re
search Institute for the past decade
has given him ample opportunity to ;
study the food problems of the Pa
cific basin.
Each of the studies contrasts the
pre-war Orient of the "Pax Britan
nica" era with that of today. We
find here an Asia whose future will
be that predominantly of an ag
ricultural economy; we see Japan's i
side of the Manchurian picture; we
find newly revised statistics of ori
ental resources, which, with their
specialized interpretation, cannot fail
to add to one's better understanding
of the Far Eastern situation.

LONG-LOST FATHER (Radio)
At the Varsity Theatre
John Barrymore occasionally acts
in very good pictures and occasion
ally amuses himself in very bad
ones; this picture falls distinctly
into the latter category. The story
is a stream-lined model of the old
tear-jerker about the father who
sacrifices himself to save his daugh
ter's honor. The plot in its modern
version loses most of the tears with
out gaining much in plausibility. To
rehearse it in detail would be a
waste of space.
With this material the cast does
surprisingly well; brilliance is not
required, nor is it forthcoming. John
Barrymore and Helen Chandler, in
the only two roles that matter, nobly
resisted temptations to overplay
either for sentiment or for burlesque,
though the material gave opportu
nity for both. Of the other charac
ters, Alan Mowbray deserves credit
for fine character work. And the
director deserves credit for keeping
the picture moving on its thin plot,
and for not making it very long.
