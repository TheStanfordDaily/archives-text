# BULL SESSION
## OH, ELL, WHERE IS THY STING 
### 
Tonight will be held the Masque
Ball and the J off re Debate. They
are somewhat similar. The Joffre
Debate is all hot air; Hell is all
hot. File, Thompson, and Wood
bury will be masquerading as
stulfed shirts —which they are not.
The rest of Stanford will be mas
querading as devils — which they
are not; being, actually, sheep in
wolve's clothing. To both the stuffed
shirts and the devils, we say "Good
luck!''

A Masque Ball is always enjoy
able. It satisfies a universally sup
pressed desire to be different —and
more acceptable in proportion to
the difference. It is hilarious, hon
ky - tonk, and delightful. College
students in youthful abandon; and
all for charity! Splendid!
* # *
We can think of but two more
ways in which the Masque Ball
could be made even more hilarious.
We believe that the masques should
be made more concealing. If the
devil masque, for instance, revealed
more of the devil and less of Bob
MeClure, Bob would be given a
certain sense of incognito that could
be used to great advantage; the
masques could serve a purpose in
versely similar to their use in O'-

Neill plays. Under cover of the
masque, masqueballers could say
to each other things they would
like to say, and ordinarily do not
dare.
* * *
As for example: A thin and ema
ciated little masque could waltz up
to Queen Harris, pipe out an imp
ish toast like, "From the 'hay' to
'hey-hey' in three quarters," and
with a frozen snicker disappear into
the sulphurous mazes of Hell.
Or a heavy and very concealing
masque' could sidle up to King Me-
Clure and belch forth in a basso
profundo something annoying like
"MeClure didn't buy his votes."
* * *'
The Masque Ball would be defi
nitely livened up. The dishing out.
of long-suppressed dirt would prob
ably clear the campus air for a
long time. It would be a spring
tonic. The Spring Cat Carnival
would be almost as refreshing as the
"Castoria Musical Festival."
* Sf« *
The other Masque Ball sugges
tion is to invite the professorate as
a body. By all means, the faculty
should go to Hell. Most, students
would favor the project. It's all for
charity!
