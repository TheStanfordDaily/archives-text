# CARDS CLAIM 22 U.C. MEET WINS
## California Takes 16 Out of 41 Contests Since 1893; 2 Tied; Quake Interrupts in 1906 
### Frank Tremaine 
Forty-two years ago tomorrow, lacking one day, Stanford and Cali
fornia met for the first time on the track with the Golden Bear scoring
a decisive 91 to M 5 victory, the worst licking administered in any Big
Meet until 1931 when a powerhouse Indian squad pulled the Bear's tail
to the tune of 101 2-3 to 29 1-3.
Since that day, April 22, 1893, California and Stanford have met on the
track every year (jut one with the Indians winning 22 decision to the

Bears' 16. Two meets resulted in
a tie. In 1906, the year of the
earthquake, the Stanford squad was
known as "the team that never ran."
Just three days prior to the meet,
the great San Francisco earthquake
demolished a goodly portion ol the
school and it was necessary to call
the contest off.
That year also marked the open
ing of freshman athletic relations
between the universities, the first
"Little Big Meet" being run off the
Saturday before the tremblor with
California winning 73 V'> to 48 1 /-;.
Bike Race I It-Id
Track fans of today would scarce
ly recognize those early meets, ac
customed as they are to the present
contests and their record breaking
performances. That first meet in
1893 included the mile walk, the
two-mile bicycle race, and the ham
mer throw, but no discus, javelin,
relay, or two-mile run. The times
and distances were also such as to
make the present track man smile
a bit, but they compared favorably
with the records of that day. The.
pole vault was won in 1893 with a
leap of 10 feet, the low hurdles in
28.4 seconds, the 100 in 10.6, and
the shot put with a mighty heave
of 36 feet 10 inches.
The Bears won nine meets before
Stanford was able to break into the
win column in 1903 with a 63 l / 2 to
58 2-3 victory and follow it up with
another one, 69 to 53, the next year.
Two Result in Ties
In 1907, the schools almost sev
ered athletic relationships over an
argument as to the place of the
meet. It had been scheduled for the
Farm the year previous before be
ing called off because of the 'quake,
so Stanford insisted on its being
held hero the following year. Cali
fornia was just as dogged in her
stand that it should be held at Ber
keley and finally won out. It was
in that year that Stanford's Lana
gan soared to the dizzy height of
12 feet 4 inches in the pole vault,
within seven-eighths of an inch of
the world record.
The meets of '96 and '22 were the
only ones to end in ties, while Stan
ford holds the honor of squeaking
through with the narrowest victory,
61 1-5 to GO 4-5, in 1913 and boom
ing in with the greatest number of
points scored in a Big Meet in 1931,
101 2-3 to 29 1-3.

"Dink" Templeton has made fa
mous the jumping Duels between
Horine of Stanford and Beeson of
California, who revolutionized high
jumping. The former first jumped
ior the Indians in 1910, leaping 6
leet ' h inches. The following year
the two jumpers tied at 6 feet 3
inches, and in 1912 Horine won the
event at 6 feet 3 1 •> inches.
The meet of 1913 was notable in
several respects. First, the biggest
crowd ever to turn out for a Big
Meet, 7200 people, was present. Ric
Templeton, Dink s brother, made
his appearance as a Stanford ath
lete, tying for second in the high
jump. That was also supposedly
"Dad" Moulton's last year as coach,
or in those days trainer, of the
Stanford team. "Dad" had been at
Stanford since 1902.

"Dad" Moulton returned to take
over the coaching duties in 1917

Forty-two years ago tomorrow, lacking one day, Stanford and Cali
fornia met for the first time on the track with the Golden Bear scoring
a decisive 91 to M 5 victory, the worst licking administered in any Big
Meet until 1931 when a powerhouse Indian squad pulled the Bear's tail
to the tune of 101 2-3 to 29 1-3.
Since that day, April 22, 1893, California and Stanford have met on the
track every year (jut one with the Indians winning 22 decision to the

Bears' 16. Two meets resulted in
a tie. In 1906, the year of the
earthquake, the Stanford squad was
known as "the team that never ran."
Just three days prior to the meet,
the great San Francisco earthquake
demolished a goodly portion ol the
school and it was necessary to call
the contest off.
That year also marked the open
ing of freshman athletic relations
between the universities, the first
"Little Big Meet" being run off the
Saturday before the tremblor with
California winning 73 V'> to 48 1 /-;.

Track fans of today would scarce
ly recognize those early meets, ac
customed as they are to the present
contests and their record breaking
performances. That first meet in
1893 included the mile walk, the
two-mile bicycle race, and the ham
mer throw, but no discus, javelin,
relay, or two-mile run. The times
and distances were also such as to
make the present track man smile
a bit, but they compared favorably
with the records of that day. The.
pole vault was won in 1893 with a
leap of 10 feet, the low hurdles in
28.4 seconds, the 100 in 10.6, and
the shot put with a mighty heave
of 36 feet 10 inches.
The Bears won nine meets before
Stanford was able to break into the
win column in 1903 with a 63 l / 2 to
58 2-3 victory and follow it up with
another one, 69 to 53, the next year.

In 1907, the schools almost sev

argument as to the place of the
meet. It had been scheduled for the
Farm the year previous before be

so Stanford insisted on its being
held hero the following year. Cali
fornia was just as dogged in her
stand that it should be held at Ber

in that year that Stanford's Lana
gan soared to the dizzy height of
12 feet 4 inches in the pole vault,
within seven-eighths of an inch of
the world record.
The meets of '96 and '22 were the

The meet of 1913 was notable in
several respects. First, the biggest
crowd ever to turn out for a Big
Meet, 7200 people, was present. Ric
Templeton, Dink s brother, made
his appearance as a Stanford ath
lete, tying for second in the high
jump. That was also supposedly
"Dad" Moulton's last year as coach,
or in those days trainer, of the
Stanford team. "Dad" had been at
Stanford since 1902.
Hie Templeton Stars
Ric Templeton was Stanford's
fair-haired boy after the 1915 con
test, for with the relay already run
and the meet depending on the
broad jump, lie took a third place
after having won the high jump
and placing third in the high hur
dles.
"Dad" Moulton returned to take
over the coaching duties in 1917
after Harry Maloney and "Nig"
Campbell had held the job for two
years, and in 1918 "Dink" took his

first fling at the job. For three
years after that Harry Maloney was
back at work, but in 1922 was offi
cially made coach. Under him Stan
i ford has lost but two Big Meets,
I tied one, and won ten.
Blazer Enters Three
The Big Meets have produced
dozens of heroes and stars and it
1 would be virtually impossible tt
compile a list of them. In 1918 Lilly
of Stanford won the 100-yard dash
{ after playing a 13-inning baseball
game against California in the
morning. The same year Gene Da
, vis scored 16 points. Another year
j Richardson ran a lap on the relay,
I turning in a lead for the next man,
Forty-two years ago tomorrow, lacking one day, Stanford and Cali
fornia met for the first time on the track with the Golden Bear scoring
a decisive 91 to M 5 victory, the worst licking administered in any Big
Meet until 1931 when a powerhouse Indian squad pulled the Bear's tail
to the tune of 101 2-3 to 29 1-3.
Since that day, April 22, 1893, California and Stanford have met on the
track every year (jut one with the Indians winning 22 decision to the

Bears' 16. Two meets resulted in
a tie. In 1906, the year of the
earthquake, the Stanford squad was
known as "the team that never ran."
Just three days prior to the meet,
the great San Francisco earthquake
demolished a goodly portion ol the
school and it was necessary to call
the contest off.
That year also marked the open
ing of freshman athletic relations
between the universities, the first
"Little Big Meet" being run off the
Saturday before the tremblor with
California winning 73 V'> to 48 1 /-;.
Bike Race I It-Id
Track fans of today would scarce
ly recognize those early meets, ac
customed as they are to the present
contests and their record breaking
performances. That first meet in
1893 included the mile walk, the
two-mile bicycle race, and the ham
mer throw, but no discus, javelin,
relay, or two-mile run. The times
and distances were also such as to
make the present track man smile
a bit, but they compared favorably
with the records of that day. The.
pole vault was won in 1893 with a
leap of 10 feet, the low hurdles in
28.4 seconds, the 100 in 10.6, and
the shot put with a mighty heave
of 36 feet 10 inches.
The Bears won nine meets before
Stanford was able to break into the
win column in 1903 with a 63 l / 2 to
58 2-3 victory and follow it up with
another one, 69 to 53, the next year.
Two Result in Ties
In 1907, the schools almost sev
ered athletic relationships over an
argument as to the place of the
meet. It had been scheduled for the
Farm the year previous before be
ing called off because of the 'quake,
so Stanford insisted on its being
held hero the following year. Cali
fornia was just as dogged in her
stand that it should be held at Ber
keley and finally won out. It was
in that year that Stanford's Lana
gan soared to the dizzy height of
12 feet 4 inches in the pole vault,
within seven-eighths of an inch of
the world record.
The meets of '96 and '22 were the
only ones to end in ties, while Stan
ford holds the honor of squeaking
through with the narrowest victory,
61 1-5 to GO 4-5, in 1913 and boom
ing in with the greatest number of
points scored in a Big Meet in 1931,
101 2-3 to 29 1-3.
Feature Jumpers
"Dink" Templeton has made fa

Horine of Stanford and Beeson of
California, who revolutionized high
jumping. The former first jumped
ior the Indians in 1910, leaping 6
leet ' h inches. The following year
the two jumpers tied at 6 feet 3
