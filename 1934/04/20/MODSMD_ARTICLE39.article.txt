# Rothert Picks Cards to Win
## Alumni Secretary Chooses Nimmo for Mile Run 
### 
Adding his vote to those of the
optimists, Harlow Rothert, former
Stanford football and basketball star
and one time holder of the Inter
collegiate shot-put record, yesterday
predicted a 69 x /> to 61'/2 victory for
the Indians in tomorrow's meet.
Rothert, who is at present secre
tary of the Alumni Association, has
been watching the trackmen with
great interest this year and has ven
tured to dope out each of the in
dividual events on the basis of his
personal observations.
"Even the close score is not indi
cative of the actual equality of the
i two teams," he said. "While I have
picked Chuck Nimmo to win thfe
mile, no one can tell how fast Cali
fornia's Raftery can run when he is
•forced to.
"Again in the half-mile, whether
! or not Nimmo can find a place among
California's flock of 1:57 men is
purely conjecture. While Gus Meier
is capable of capturing first in both
hurdle races, it may be underesti
mating Klopstock's ability by giving
him one second and one third.' In
any event, he will have a close battle
I in the lows against Dick Coe of the
Bears.
"The meet will, in all probability,
!be won by the relay. Unless Cali
fornia runners build up a tremen
dous lead before A1 Blackman starts
out on his anchor lap, Stanford will
have chalked up at the end of the
afternoon its eleventh straight Big
Meet victory."

Adding his vote to those of the
optimists, Harlow Rothert, former
Stanford football and basketball star
and one time holder of the Inter
collegiate shot-put record, yesterday
predicted a 69 x /> to 61'/2 victory for
the Indians in tomorrow's meet.
Rothert, who is at present secre
tary of the Alumni Association, has
been watching the trackmen with
great interest this year and has ven
tured to dope out each of the in
dividual events on the basis of his
personal observations.
"Even the close score is not indi
cative of the actual equality of the
i two teams," he said. "While I have
picked Chuck Nimmo to win thfe
mile, no one can tell how fast Cali
fornia's Raftery can run when he is
•forced to.
"Again in the half-mile, whether
! or not Nimmo can find a place among
California's flock of 1:57 men is
purely conjecture. While Gus Meier
is capable of capturing first in both
hurdle races, it may be underesti
mating Klopstock's ability by giving
him one second and one third.' In
any event, he will have a close battle
I in the lows against Dick Coe of the
Bears.
"The meet will, in all probability,
!be won by the relay. Unless Cali
fornia runners build up a tremen
dous lead before A1 Blackman starts
out on his anchor lap, Stanford will
have chalked up at the end of the
afternoon its eleventh straight Big
Meet victory."
