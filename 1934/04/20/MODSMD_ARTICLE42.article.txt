# THE 						KING REIGNS
## 
### 
Rumors that the Masque Ball
might have had a King by
proxy tonight were plugged last
night when the Men's Council
met to consider charges that
two checks which had been
used to buy votes for one ol the
candidates were not backed by
funds at the hank on which
they were drawn. At the time
the checks were made out,
there were not any funds un
der the name of the student who
signed them. They were writ
ten in good faith, however, and
money deposited before regular
opening time yesterday morn
ing.
