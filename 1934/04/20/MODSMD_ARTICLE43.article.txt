Shades of early Stanford life
will live again on the campus to
day and tomorrow for the benefit
of returning alumni.
An old-time tallyho will appear
Saturday to transport visiting
alumni about the campus and will
be driven by Dan Wood, livery
man and one of the oldest stage
drivers now living.
A tallyho is explained to the
younger genex-ations as sort of
wagon with capacity for about 15
drawn by a team of four horses.
In the first decade of the century
tallyhos were used at Stanford ty
carry women en masse to dances
and social functions.
Further by way of making early
alumni feel at home, a 1911 Stu
debaker, one of the first automo
biles, will be used today to meet
Leroy Edwai'ds, chairman of Uni
versity Day as he disembarks at
the station.
