# Alumni to Stage Golf Tourney Here Sunday
## 
### 
Alumni golfers will welcome the
news of the tournament to be
played Sunday on the Stanford
course, with prizes to be awarded
the winning grads, all without any
green fees.
This has been made possible by
the B.A.C. as a part of the Home
coming program of the week-end.
Starting times will be reserved for
the alumni between 9 and 12 o'clock
Sunday morning.
