# Frosh Debate Cal on Tariff
## 
### 
"Resolved: that the United States !
should complete its policy of eco
nomic nationalism," subject of last j
night's no-decision debate between !
California and Stanford freshmen, j
resolved itself into one side blam
ing the tariff for the depression, and
the other in calling the tariff the
solution for the depression.
Stanford, taking the affirmative, |
was represented by Edwin Janss, j
Harold Charters, and Edward Lind
blom, with Arnold Abrams, Rich- j
ard Rathbun, and Willard Goodwin
of California opposing them.
"Internationalism is against the |
very theory of the present recov- !
ery system, which demands inter- !
nal regulation without the external '
influence of foreign imports," de- '
clared Janss, lead-off man for Stan- j
ford.
"It will keep up our high stand- j
ard of living, and shut out the flow \
of cheap goods into America,"
Charters, second Stanford speaker,
said, supporting him.
Marshaling an impressive array of
historical data and statistics to back
them, California's debaters branded- j
Stanford's stand as "a marvelous i
display of short-sighted astigma
tism" in viewing the present eco
nomic situation.
Rathbun, second California speak
er, gave the wheat debacle as an :
example of what retaliatory tariffs i
can do. He presented a woeful pic
ture of American industry languish- ;
ing without the sun of foreign trade j
shining upon it.
As a conclusion to the Stanford
attitude, Lindblom asked whether !
we can sacrifice the 90 per cent of I
our trade which domestic consum- j
ers supply for the 10 per cent of our I
total business activity which foreign j
trade comprises.
