# VARSITY TENNIS PLAYERS TACKLE BEARS TOMORROW
## S. Lee on Bench; Downey Plays Number Two 
### 
Looming up as the hardest as well
us final match of the season for
Stanford, the Cardinal netmen meet
the Bears from Berkeley tomorrow
morning at 10 o'clock, in what wiil
be a prelude to the Big Track Meet
later in the day.
Allowing for improvement and th'-
fact that they have won one match
already from California, tho Stan
ford tennis team must be given a
slight edge tomorrow. But from the I
point of view of determination, and
actual physical condition, the U.C.
netmen must be ranked as formid
able opponents. The match score
may very well end up as eight
matches to one, as well as five
matches to four, in either team s i
favor.
Lee Out
Sam Lee, number two man at the j
present time, and one of the pivot
points around which the Stanford
team centers, is definitely out of any
further competition. Although he ;
was released from the hospital
Thui'sday afternoon, he is suffering
from a slightly cracked collar bone,
is well taped up, and any chances
of his playing tomorrow are defi
nitely squashed.
As a result, Jack Downey, who
played number two substitute man
lor Lee last week against U.C.L.A..
and barely Jost in three sets, will be
on hand again in this position, fight
ing to down Carl Holmes, one of ine
strongest net players in the Coast
conference.
Otis Faces Smith
Captain Chuck Otis take on Cap
tain Gene Smith of California n
what promises to be the feature
match of the afternoon. Last month,
over at the Berkeley courts, Smith's
change of pace and slow stroking
defeated Otis. Tomorrow, on the re
cently refinished court, much faster
than that at California, Otis will be
at the peak of his game, and out to '
avenge his defeat by Smith. There
should be fireworks.
John Law of the Indian team will
play Harold Brown, cocky little
player from Berkeley, in another
toss-up match. Either man may
win, but because Law has lost the
majority of his matches ihis season,
farm rooters are waiting for him to
get hot and lake Brown into camp.
In the number four spot Monty
Shwayder takes on Massie of the
Bears, and Dan Clark is slated to
play Bakulitch, a steady player, with
the handicap of poor eyes, however.
In the sixth position, Ted Lilen
thal has'been in the hospital with a
bad foot, and if he is unable to com
pete, Ray Jadarola, with a curious
game that is hard to master, may get
to play against Dunlop of the Bears.
There is slight possibility that the
Stanford team will win more than
two singles matches. To defeat Cali
fornia they will have to repeat as
Ihey did against U.C.L.A., and score
three doubles triumphs. In the first
doubles, with Otis and Law teamed
together, there is a good chance of
winning. However, the second dou
bles, Ondy Martin and Jack Downey
is doubtful. Shwayder and Bogan,
the third doubles team for Stanford,
are an exceedingly steady pair, and
perhaps upon their shoulders, ihe
outcome of ihe entire match wiii
rest.

is doubtful. Shwayder and Bogan,
the third doubles team for Stanford,
are an exceedingly steady pair, and
perhaps upon their shoulders, ihe
outcome of ihe entire match wiii
rest.
Looming up as the hardest as well
us final match of the season for
Stanford, the Cardinal netmen meet
the Bears from Berkeley tomorrow
morning at 10 o'clock, in what wiil
be a prelude to the Big Track Meet
later in the day.
Allowing for improvement and th'-
fact that they have won one match
already from California, tho Stan
ford tennis team must be given a
slight edge tomorrow. But from the I
point of view of determination, and
actual physical condition, the U.C.
netmen must be ranked as formid
able opponents. The match score
may very well end up as eight
matches to one, as well as five
matches to four, in either team s i
favor.
Lee Out
Sam Lee, number two man at the j
present time, and one of the pivot
points around which the Stanford
team centers, is definitely out of any
further competition. Although he ;
was released from the hospital
Thui'sday afternoon, he is suffering
from a slightly cracked collar bone,
is well taped up, and any chances
of his playing tomorrow are defi
nitely squashed.
As a result, Jack Downey, who
played number two substitute man
lor Lee last week against U.C.L.A..
and barely Jost in three sets, will be
on hand again in this position, fight
ing to down Carl Holmes, one of ine
strongest net players in the Coast
conference.
Otis Faces Smith
Captain Chuck Otis take on Cap
tain Gene Smith of California n
what promises to be the feature
match of the afternoon. Last month,
over at the Berkeley courts, Smith's
change of pace and slow stroking
defeated Otis. Tomorrow, on the re
cently refinished court, much faster
than that at California, Otis will be
at the peak of his game, and out to '
avenge his defeat by Smith. There
should be fireworks.
John Law of the Indian team will
play Harold Brown, cocky little
player from Berkeley, in another
toss-up match. Either man may
win, but because Law has lost the
majority of his matches ihis season,
farm rooters are waiting for him to
get hot and lake Brown into camp.
In the number four spot Monty
Shwayder takes on Massie of the
Bears, and Dan Clark is slated to
play Bakulitch, a steady player, with
the handicap of poor eyes, however.
In the sixth position, Ted Lilen
thal has'been in the hospital with a
bad foot, and if he is unable to com
pete, Ray Jadarola, with a curious
game that is hard to master, may get
to play against Dunlop of the Bears.
There is slight possibility that the
Stanford team will win more than
two singles matches. To defeat Cali
fornia they will have to repeat as
Ihey did against U.C.L.A., and score
three doubles triumphs. In the first
doubles, with Otis and Law teamed
together, there is a good chance of
winning. However, the second dou
bles, Ondy Martin and Jack Downey
is doubtful. Shwayder and Bogan,
the third doubles team for Stanford,
are an exceedingly steady pair, and
perhaps upon their shoulders, ihe
outcome of ihe entire match wiii
rest.
