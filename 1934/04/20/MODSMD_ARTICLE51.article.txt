# IT ADDS UP ALL WRONG

### 
There it. is, but it adds up all
wrong. According to that Califor
nia wins 66 to 65, but after 10 con
secutive years of Stanford victories,
that certainly can't be right. And

it may bo wrong, at that.
There are plenty of "ifs" in that
dope sheet and every one of them
must come out right if California is
to win. For instance, it's quite likely
that Zaches or Williams will come
through with a leap which will push
either Micelli or Treadwell or both
of them out of the picture in the
broad jump.
Schween, on the basis of his per
formances last year, is fully capable
of beating Thompson and so is Ar
thur. On the other hand, there is a
possibility that Dave Meek, the three
sport Bear, might eclipse the mark
of one of the Indian jumpers.
