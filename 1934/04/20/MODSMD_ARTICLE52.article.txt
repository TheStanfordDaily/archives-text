# CAN NIMMO TAKE TWO RACES?
## 
### 
Nimmo showed last Saturday that
he is fully capable of beating any
times turned in this season by Cali
fornia 880 men, yet he must run a
mile and beat one of the best milcrs
in the West, Raftery, before the half
and there are plenty of Californians
who say that "Liittle Chuck" won't
even do that. There are plenty of
Stanfordites who say he will, though,
and do it with enough kick left to
come back and turn in a fast 880.
Blackman could lake second in the
220 with Thoms third, but that would
force him out of the relay or at least
take a lot out of him and the relay is
only one event, from the 220. But if
Stanford took second and third in
the 220 and other events went as
figured, California could win the re
lay and still lose the meet. It all
looks screwy to us.
Still another possibility is Lyman's
defeating Wood for second place in
the discus. There are several "ifs"

on (he other aide <-f the ledger, too.
