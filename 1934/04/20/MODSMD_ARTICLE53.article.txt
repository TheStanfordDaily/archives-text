# RECORDS MAY BE BROKEN
## 
### 
California says Coe and Charvel
are going to push Klopstock out of
the hurdles or at lct-st hold him to a
third. They also figure Mackey and
Wood can keep John Layman out of
the discus. According to Bear dope
sters, Thorns is no better than third
in the sprints and they figure a clean
sweep in the half-mile.
Any way you figure, it looks like
the closest and most exciting Big
Meet in years. In addition to the
closeness of the final score there
should be several records broken.
Lyman, • Deacon, Clarke, and Meier
are counted as almost certain record
breakers while Motiram, Blackman,
and Nimmo are quite capable of
cl acking the marks in their events if
pushed hard enough. —Trejnaine
