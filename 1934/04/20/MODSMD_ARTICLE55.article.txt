# DINK AIMS FOR ELEVENTH STRAIGHT BIG MEET WIN
## 
### SPUD HAMILTON 
The onetime "boy coach" with his floppity mop of hair and the one
sided grin has become more or less the "old maestro" of Pacific Coast track
nowadays, but his propensity for winning Big Meets continues undimin
ished with the years. f

Tomorrow the impeccably attired
Dink Templeton will be shooting for
his eleventh straight Big Meet vic
tory, hoping for the small, but com
fortable winning margin which Old
Man Dope says should be the In
dian's by right." But that reverend
sorcerer who with the aid of statis
tical tables and much bumptious
guessing foresees the trend of things,
also declares that it is high time the
siring of Stanford victories was
ended.
And with the rise of California
teams under honest Brutus Hamil
ton, it begins to look as if Templeton
will be obligated to forsake the win
ning side of the column very shortly,
within a year or so, if not this time.
Friendship Began in '20
Hamilton and Templeton have
both given out the word this week
that there is to be no monfcey busi
ness tomorrow; no "boxing" of run
ners and no shouldering out of
boxes; and likely enough there will
be no cause to call out the county
surveyor and a corps of engineers to
decide on the winner of the javelin.
The friendship of the two rival
coaches has beeij a remarkable phase
of these latter two years of Big Meet
competition, and a pre-eminently
satisfactory friendship it has been to
all, with the possible exception of
the honorable "Brick" Morse who
may harbor fears that Big Meets will
evolve into Templeton - Hamilton
love feasts.
That friendship traces 'way back
to the Olympic team days of 1920
when the pair went to Antwerp,
Templeton as a broad jumper and
Hamilton in the decathlon. Since
then the former Stanford star has
been devoting himself to turning out
winning track teams while Hamilton
was developing champions at the
University of Kansas.
Stars in Track
In college, "Dink" was a rugby
and football player par excellence,
noted for his long drop kicking and
punting. In one Big Game he booted
a field goal Over from the 45-yard
iine; and an international rugby at
I he Olympic Games in 1924, he drop
kicked a 45-yard goal irom a dead
run during the play.
But track was his real forte, and
he won the high jump at the 1920
ICAAAA meet, only to lose out in
the Olympic trials when the authori
ties barred his jumping style. He
calmly dusted himself off, ambled
f.way to the broad jumping pits and
came through with a single leap that
placed him on the team.
Streak Unbroken
He opened his coaching career as
the "boy wonder" at Stanford in
1921 and after losing two Big Meets
and tieing one, in 1924 he started
lhat winning coaching streak over
the Californians that yet has to be
broken. In 1927, 1928, and 1929 he
won the ICAAAA plus the NCAA in

! 1928, and in the past few years has
| been nosed out of the Eastern meet
j by a close margin by the Trojans
every year.
Some of the great athletes de
| veloped by Templeton include Ben
Eastman, holder of the world record
iof 46.4 in the quarter-mile; Gus
Meier, co-author of the 120 high
hurdles mark in 14.2; the intercol
legiate mile relay record team of
Maynor Shove, Les and Ike Hables,
and Ben Eastman; Bill Miller and
1 Bud Deacon in the pole vault, the
former an Olympic champion; John
Lyman, Harlow Rothert, Gordon
Dunn and Nellie Gray in the shot-

I discus throwers; Kim Dyer in the
broad jump.

Friendship Began in '20
Hamilton and Templeton have
both given out the word this week
that there is to be no monfcey busi
ness tomorrow; no "boxing" of run
ners and no shouldering out of
boxes; and likely enough there will
be no cause to call out the county
surveyor and a corps of engineers to
decide on the winner of the javelin.
The friendship of the two rival
coaches has beeij a remarkable phase
of these latter two years of Big Meet
competition, and a pre-eminently
satisfactory friendship it has been to
all, with the possible exception of
the honorable "Brick" Morse who
may harbor fears that Big Meets will
evolve into Templeton - Hamilton
love feasts.
That friendship traces 'way back
to the Olympic team days of 1920
when the pair went to Antwerp,
Templeton as a broad jumper and
Hamilton in the decathlon. Since
then the former Stanford star has
been devoting himself to turning out
winning track teams while Hamilton
was developing champions at the
University of Kansas.
Stars in Track
In college, "Dink" was a rugby
and football player par excellence,
noted for his long drop kicking and
punting. In one Big Game he booted
a field goal Over from the 45-yard
iine; and an international rugby at
I he Olympic Games in 1924, he drop
kicked a 45-yard goal irom a dead
run during the play.
But track was his real forte, and
he won the high jump at the 1920
ICAAAA meet, only to lose out in
the Olympic trials when the authori
ties barred his jumping style. He
calmly dusted himself off, ambled
f.way to the broad jumping pits and
came through with a single leap that
placed him on the team.
Streak Unbroken
He opened his coaching career as
the "boy wonder" at Stanford in
1921 and after losing two Big Meets
and tieing one, in 1924 he started
lhat winning coaching streak over
the Californians that yet has to be
broken. In 1927, 1928, and 1929 he
won the ICAAAA plus the NCAA in

! 1928, and in the past few years has
| been nosed out of the Eastern meet
j by a close margin by the Trojans
every year.
Some of the great athletes de
| veloped by Templeton include Ben
Eastman, holder of the world record
iof 46.4 in the quarter-mile; Gus
Meier, co-author of the 120 high
hurdles mark in 14.2; the intercol
legiate mile relay record team of
Maynor Shove, Les and Ike Hables,
and Ben Eastman; Bill Miller and
1 Bud Deacon in the pole vault, the
former an Olympic champion; John
Lyman, Harlow Rothert, Gordon
Dunn and Nellie Gray in the shot-
I put; Eric Kienz and Here Laßorde,
I discus throwers; Kim Dyer in the
broad jump.
The onetime "boy coach" with his floppity mop of hair and the one
sided grin has become more or less the "old maestro" of Pacific Coast track
nowadays, but his propensity for winning Big Meets continues undimin
ished with the years. f

Tomorrow the impeccably attired
Dink Templeton will be shooting for
his eleventh straight Big Meet vic
tory, hoping for the small, but com
fortable winning margin which Old
Man Dope says should be the In
