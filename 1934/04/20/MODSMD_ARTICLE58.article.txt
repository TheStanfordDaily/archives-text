Stanford intramural athletics" —

ing groups in touch football, golf,
handball, track and field, basketball,
tennis, swimming, baseball, play
ground ball, horseshoes, and relays
—afforded recreation and physical
training to one-fourth of the men
enrolled dt Stanford, or a majority
of those eligible under restrictions
on freshman and varsity squads, and
not engaged in other activities.
Statistics just released by Intra
mural Manager Marvin Kahn show
that during fall quarter 526 men
represented 52 organizations in 92
games of touch football. Sigma Nu
won the championship, with Alpha
Tau Omega second. Twenty-six fra
ternities entered 376 men in fall i
quarter sports, while 23 other groups
entered 248. Hours of actual play
were 2,190.
There are trophy cups for touch
football, basketball, hard baseball,
and track and field. For the relay
carnival there are cups for individ
ual events, and for swimming there
is a handsome big plaque. In the
past there have been small plaques
for championships of various leagues,
but the intramural budget allowed
by the B.A.C. has allowed neither
this expense nor that of awarding
cups or plaques to the all-University
champions in golf, handball, and ten
nis this year.
