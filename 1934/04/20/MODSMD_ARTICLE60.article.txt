# CARD, BEAR NINES OUT FOR VICTORY IN FINAL CONTEST
## 
### 
Just a ball game will be at stake
tomorrow afternoon when the Card
and Bear baseball varsities play oil
the final fray of their five-game se
ries on the Sunken Diafnond follow
ing the Big Meet. For Cal has not
only won the Big Series by trimming
the Indians 13-7, 4-2, G-5, and 5-3
in the four games already played,
but it has gained the California
Interscholastic Baseball Federation
title for 134.
Both teams will send their full
strength onto the diamond, however,
for more than the traditional rivalry
will be surprising on the rival nines.
California wants the ball game be
eause Big Bill Peterson, hero of
many a past Bear Tussle, will be
pitching his last game for the Blue
and Gold.
Stanford will be out to win be
cause" the Cards will have their last
chance to apply a brilliant finish to
a disappointing season. The Cards
will also be out to win for Stan An
derson, the steady right-hander who
has been lobbed of the credit of
victory for more than one game this
season by poor, fielding support of
his teammates, and the failure of
the Indian batters to hit when hits
meant runs.
With Peterson chucking for the
Bears and Anderson on the mound
for the Cards the fans will be treated
to the best efforts of the cream of
pitching talent of the college league.
Yet Stanford hitters never have had
trouble getting their bingles when
Peterson is on the mound, although
he usually manages to keep the In
dian hits well scattered. And Ander
son seems to have one bad inning
when in usual form, so the game
should be more than a pitching duel,
which often gets boresome to other
than the most rabid fans.
The one possible change that may
take place in the Card line-up over
that of the last Cal game of Tuesday
afternoon is the substitution of
Gordy Mallatratt. on the one bag for
Art Hearn. Mallatratt held down
the first base position last season,
but has played third this year up to
Tuesday's game.y
Ten members of the Stanford var
sity will be wearing the Indian uni
form for the last time tomorrow.
They include Captain Dick Miles,
Jim Massey, Art Hearn, Lowell Nut
ting, Fred Maggiora, Jim Newman,
Bob Savinske, Jerry Trautman,
Charley Dodge, and Floyd Campbell.
The line-ups: Stanford varsity—
Hearn or Mallatratt, lb, Nutting cf,
Hamilton rf, Miles If, Galbraith 2b,
Trautman 3b, Tremaine ss, Dodge c,
Anderson p.
California varsity — Hallauer ss,

will also be out to win for Stan An
derson, the steady right-hander who
has been lobbed of the credit of
victory for more than one game this
season by poor, fielding support of
his teammates, and the failure of
the Indian batters to hit when hits
meant runs.
With Peterson chucking for the
Bears and Anderson on the mound
for the Cards the fans will be treated
to the best efforts of the cream of
pitching talent of the college league.
Yet Stanford hitters never have had
trouble getting their bingles when
Peterson is on the mound, although
he usually manages to keep the In
dian hits well scattered. And Ander
son seems to have one bad inning
when in usual form, so the game
should be more than a pitching duel,
which often gets boresome to other
than the most rabid fans.
The one possible change that may
take place in the Card line-up over
that of the last Cal game of Tuesday
afternoon is the substitution of
Gordy Mallatratt. on the one bag for
Art Hearn. Mallatratt held down
the first base position last season,
but has played third this year up to
Tuesday's game.y
Ten members of the Stanford var
sity will be wearing the Indian uni
form for the last time tomorrow.
They include Captain Dick Miles,
Jim Massey, Art Hearn, Lowell Nut
ting, Fred Maggiora, Jim Newman,
Bob Savinske, Jerry Trautman,
Charley Dodge, and Floyd Campbell.
The line-ups: Stanford varsity—
Hearn or Mallatratt, lb, Nutting cf,
Hamilton rf, Miles If, Galbraith 2b,
Trautman 3b, Tremaine ss, Dodge c,
Anderson p.
California varsity — Hallauer ss,
Jacobsen If, Sanchez 2b, Relies rf,
Thompson 3b, Grilk lb, Sparling cf,
Williams c, Peterson p.
Just a ball game will be at stake
tomorrow afternoon when the Card
and Bear baseball varsities play oil
the final fray of their five-game se
ries on the Sunken Diafnond follow
ing the Big Meet. For Cal has not
only won the Big Series by trimming
the Indians 13-7, 4-2, G-5, and 5-3
in the four games already played,
but it has gained the California
Interscholastic Baseball Federation
title for 134.
Both teams will send their full
strength onto the diamond, however,
for more than the traditional rivalry
will be surprising on the rival nines.
California wants the ball game be
eause Big Bill Peterson, hero of
many a past Bear Tussle, will be
pitching his last game for the Blue
and Gold.
Stanford will be out to win be
cause" the Cards will have their last
chance to apply a brilliant finish to
a disappointing season. The Cards
will also be out to win for Stan An
derson, the steady right-hander who
