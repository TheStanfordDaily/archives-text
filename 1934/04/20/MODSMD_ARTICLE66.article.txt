# STANFORD, U.C. GOLF TEAMS MEET TODAY
## Indians Expected to Win Orinda Tournament 
### 
When the Stanford golf team tees
off against the California varsity this
morning iit the Orinda Country Club,
it will have an edge against the
Berkeley team. Coach Edward
Twiggs has refused to give a definite
starting line-up because some of
the positions are still up in the air.
If ladder play counts at all, Don
Edwards probably will have the
lead-ofT position. Don has had quite
a bit of experience, although he is
far from a veteran.
Giddings Second
In the second position on the
ladder is Dick Giddings, who has
shown himself quite a golfer lately,
both by defeating Jack Hoerner in
campus play and by his progress in
the Northern. California Amateur
last week-end. He is reported to
have a sore linger at present, how
ever, and may not play.
In the third position is Hoerner,
who until last week was lead-off
man after taking the throne with
the departure of Lawson Little for
England.
I)wycr Comes Up
Tom Dwyer is in the fourth* po
sition; he has risen to this challeng
ing rung on the ladder from ninth
place. He is among the members of
the team who have played in the
national amateur.
In the fifth position is Morse Ers
kine who is said by critics to be the
stylist of the Stanford team. Below
him is Bob Thompson who lost by
default to Erskine in a ladder match.
In the sixth position is Dan Mo
ser who has toured Orinda in 68
strokes. In the seventh place is
Gene Brown who was minor sports
champion last year; lately his golf
game has been in a slump, but he is
back in shape now.
Others who have a chance of play
ing are Bill Hoelle, Hugh Mellon,
Sten Shcppard, and Charles De-
Bretteville.
