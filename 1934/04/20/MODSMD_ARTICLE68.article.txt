# NINE VETERANS RETURN FOR '34 ELEVEN; REGULARS TO SCRIMMAGE THIS AFTERNOON
## 
### 
When ihe Row and HalLs begin to
echo with arguments pro and con on
the national football situation next
October, Stanford's Big Red Ma
chine, which gives a preview per
formance on the practice field today,
will already be started on the road
which should lead it through one
of the most successful seasons en
joyed by an Indian football team in
years.
Hailed as a question mark at the
beginning of the 1933 season and
With much depending on whether or
not certain highly touted but inex
perienced sophomores could live up
to their imputations, the Stanford
team with "Tiny" Thornhill in his
first season as head coach surprised
the world by drubbing U.S.C.'s na
tional champions 13 to 7 and nosing
out California 7 to 3.
Corbus, Norgard Gone
Of the team which started the Big
Game last fall only All-American
Bill Corbus and A1 Norgard are
gone. Corbus will be sorely missed
with his accurate place kicking and
great line play while it was Nor
gard's .catch of Alustiza's pass and
his long run which scored the win
ning touchdown over the Bears.
To replace Corbus is another
member of the great freshman team
of 1932, Larry Rouble, who won his
spurs last year as the All-Ameri
can's substitute. Keith Topping will
probably fit into Norgard's place at
end as he did in the New Year's Day
game at Pasadena after it was found
that the latter was ineligible.
Regulars Back
The rest of the team, barring sud
den improvement by reserves or
members of last fall's freshman
team, will line up as it did last fall
with Moscrip at the other end; Rey
nolds and Callaway at tackles;
O'Connor with Rouble at guards;
Muller, center; and Grayson, Alu
stiza, Hamilton, and Maentz in the
backfield.
Ed Lettunich and Jack Drown,
both in their last season of eligibility,
will be out for first-string jobs.
A place will also have to be found
for Ben Palamountain, first-string
tackle until he broke his ankle in

I the Santa Clara game last fall. There
j i.s a possibility that he might move
! over to end.
Adams at Guard
! Woody Adams, Rouble's running
mate on the frosh and as second-
I string man la.st season, will be a
! valuable man again this year at
! guard as will Bob Black. Alf Bran
â€¢ din, still bothered by the weak knee
i which has troubled him for two
J years, has already served notice that
j he is going to push Muller for the
| center position.
j In the backfield, Buck Van Dellen,
| the sensation of the U.S.C. game, will
| bo back and may break into the
I first string. Also Stan Anderson, the
j fullback whose 72-yard from behind
I his own goal line pulled the Indians
I out of a hole in the 1932 California
I game, will be back for duty. Van
j Dellen, Reisner, Brnnstein, Hoos,
: and Todd will also see action in the
1 backfield.
