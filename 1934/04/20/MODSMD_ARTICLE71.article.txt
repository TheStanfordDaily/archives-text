# LITTLE BIG MEET UPSETS LIKELY AS DOPE DEADLOCKED
## Bear Strength Expected In Sprints and Jumps 
### 
With a deadlocked dope-bucket
open to ever-so-many upsets, fresh
man ti'ack teams from the rival in
stitutions of the University of Cali
fornia and Stanford University meet
this afternoon. Time and place:
Edwards Field, Berkeley, at 2
o'clock.
Dope sheets from both schools
range in scoring from 72-59 to 65-
66, with either team on the long
end. At any event, the winner will
not be known until thirteen or four
teen of the events are over. Bear
strength will certainly be felt in
top-heavy fashion in the sprints and
the jumps.
Ifelmer in Sptinls
Latest report from the Eastbay
campus has it that Jim Helmer,
great prep sprinted from Piedmont
last year, will run the sprints in
stead of the 440, as was originally
supposed. This move will strengthen
Cal considerably, as Helmer may
take a second and a third to cinch
George Anderson, and cut frosh
sprinters Faye and Williams out of
lour points.
Although Dick KaufTman, best
Card broadjumper, pulled a muscle
Wednesday and will not jump today.
Chuck Voigt, injured though he is,
may take one leap and a place.
Good llaccs Loom
Good races loom in all of the run
ning events. Winners appear to be:
sprints, Anderson, Cal; 440, Green,
Stanford; Mile, March, Stanford;
two-mile, Lyons, Cal; 880, blanket
finish with McCurdy and Alexander,
Stanford, and Heavy, Cal—no dope
available.
The 880 will be a thriller. Bob
Heavy of Cal has come up in a
single month to a point where he
may take the Stanford pair, who
have been hit by injury and mis
fortune all year, and have been
straining in the last two meets.
Both have better time than the Cal
novice, however, and will come in
one-two if experience means any
thing.
Green a Cinch
If Helmer runs the sprints, Joe
Green of the papooses is a cinch
winner in the 440, with second place
open to anyone who can do under
52 flat. As there is no second fast
quartermiler for Stanford, a couple
of Bear men have the inside track
ior the remaining four points.
The should come out with
Captam Rusty March of Stanford
in the lead, Les Voorhees of Cal
second, and Mort D'Evelyn of Stan-
Jord third. March may, with a fast
pace in the first three laps, break
the record of 4:23 set last year by
Chuck Nimmo, as he is a virtually
tireless runner and always has a
Jast sprint left for the home stretch.
Lyons Favored
Bob Lyons, with a two-mile mark
of 10:24, is favored in that event for
Cal. He may break the record of
10:16 if pushed to a fast enough pace
by the two frosh entries, Max Schi
ierl and Warren Breed, both of
whom are oyer 10 seconds behind
Lyons in past time trials.
Ernie Evans, big frosh hurdler has
a couple of strenuous races on his
hands when he meets the two Bear
timber-toppers, Stout and Waddell.
II Evans is at top form, he can take
the measure of both Cubs, but the
omnipresent danger of hitting a
hurdle is, staring all three in the
lace, and any one of them may
triumph.

stitutions of the University of Cali
fornia and Stanford University meet
this afternoon. Time and place:
Edwards Field, Berkeley, at 2
o'clock.
Dope sheets from both schools
range in scoring from 72-59 to 65-
66, with either team on the long
end. At any event, the winner will
not be known until thirteen or four
teen of the events are over. Bear
strength will certainly be felt in
top-heavy fashion in the sprints and
the jumps.
Ifelmer in Sptinls
Latest report from the Eastbay
campus has it that Jim Helmer,
great prep sprinted from Piedmont
last year, will run the sprints in
stead of the 440, as was originally
supposed. This move will strengthen
Cal considerably, as Helmer may
take a second and a third to cinch
George Anderson, and cut frosh
sprinters Faye and Williams out of
lour points.
Although Dick KaufTman, best
Card broadjumper, pulled a muscle
Wednesday and will not jump today.
Chuck Voigt, injured though he is,
may take one leap and a place.
Good llaccs Loom
Good races loom in all of the run
ning events. Winners appear to be:
sprints, Anderson, Cal; 440, Green,
Stanford; Mile, March, Stanford;
two-mile, Lyons, Cal; 880, blanket
finish with McCurdy and Alexander,
Stanford, and Heavy, Cal—no dope
available.
The 880 will be a thriller. Bob
Heavy of Cal has come up in a
single month to a point where he
may take the Stanford pair, who
have been hit by injury and mis
fortune all year, and have been
straining in the last two meets.
Both have better time than the Cal
novice, however, and will come in
one-two if experience means any
thing.
Green a Cinch
If Helmer runs the sprints, Joe
Green of the papooses is a cinch
winner in the 440, with second place
open to anyone who can do under
52 flat. As there is no second fast
quartermiler for Stanford, a couple
of Bear men have the inside track
ior the remaining four points.
The should come out with
Captam Rusty March of Stanford
in the lead, Les Voorhees of Cal
second, and Mort D'Evelyn of Stan-
Jord third. March may, with a fast
pace in the first three laps, break
the record of 4:23 set last year by
Chuck Nimmo, as he is a virtually
tireless runner and always has a
Jast sprint left for the home stretch.
Lyons Favored
Bob Lyons, with a two-mile mark
of 10:24, is favored in that event for
Cal. He may break the record of
10:16 if pushed to a fast enough pace
by the two frosh entries, Max Schi
ierl and Warren Breed, both of
whom are oyer 10 seconds behind
Lyons in past time trials.
Ernie Evans, big frosh hurdler has
a couple of strenuous races on his
hands when he meets the two Bear
timber-toppers, Stout and Waddell.
II Evans is at top form, he can take
the measure of both Cubs, but the
omnipresent danger of hitting a
hurdle is, staring all three in the
lace, and any one of them may
triumph.
With a deadlocked dope-bucket
open to ever-so-many upsets, fresh
man ti'ack teams from the rival in
stitutions of the University of Cali
fornia and Stanford University meet
this afternoon. Time and place:
Edwards Field, Berkeley, at 2
o'clock.
