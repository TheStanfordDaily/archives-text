# AVALANCHE OF BELATED ENTRIES FORCES ELIMINATION OF WATER CARNIVAL TEAMS
## 
### 
An unexpected avalanche of en
try blanks yesterday forced Junior
Water Carnival committee mem
bers to select competitors in three
men's events by means of a draw.
Largest entry list was in the ca
noe tilting, but only sixteen names
could be admitted. In this event,
no organization is represented by
mere than one contestant. There
will be four semi-fianls, with four
canoes at a time. In the pigeon race
(nautical musical chairs), no limi
tation was set, and 29 men entered.
Feature women's events will be
the 50-yard free-style, the egg and
spoon race, and the "Riding the
Dolphin" relay.
