# NEW SPORT AWARD COMMITTEE NAMED
## 
### 
In an effort to decide on the
method of trying to even up major
and minor sports, the Circle "S"
Society yesterday discussed the
problem, and President Carl Knecht
appointed a committee to look into
the matter.
Jimmy Triolo will head the group,
assisted by Gene Brown and Ray
Wilbur, Jr.
The society hopes to level of! the
distinction between the two sports
divisions. Several plans were sug
gested, with one faction of the group
favoring a complete revision, where
by all sports would receive the
same award, and another portion
favoring a less drastic "leveling off"
of the distinction between the so
called major and minor sports.
The "unfair practice" of judging
an activity to be a major sport sim
ply because it receives more pub
licity than another ,sport was point
ed out.
Concerning the matter, Triolo
said:
"We feel that this is the oppor
tune time to correct the discrimi
nation that has undoubtedly been
shown in the past in favor of the
so-called major sports against the
minor sports.
"Our committee will co-operate
with the newly appointed Consti
tution Revision Committee in an ef
fort to effect some reform along
this line."
