(Daily Californian)

"Resurrector of track and field at
the University oi California" is the
title bestowed on Brutus Hamilton,
who in two years has brought the
Bear cindermen from the lowest
ranks of the Coast to one of the
highest.
Succeeding Walter Christie, who
resigned in 1932 after coaching the
Blue and Gold track men for 31
years, Hamilton arrived in Berkeley
last spring. He immediately was
tendered a three-year contract by
the A.S.U.C.
Coaches at Kansas
Hamilton has previously served as
coach of the University of Kansas
where he enjoyed many successful
seasons. In 1930 and 1931, his first
two years there, his teams won the
"Big Six" championship, while in
1932 his squad finished third. He
lost only two duals meets while
teaching Midwesterners, and both
were to Nebraska.
The genial Bear mentor had the
distinction of being a member of
two United States Olympic teams,
competing in 1920 and 1924. Hamil
ton won second place in the de
cathalon in his first appearance, and
captured a fourth in 1924.
All-around Athlete
An all-around athlete, Hamilton
participated in football and basket
ball in addition to track and field.
He played the gridiron game while
attending Missouri, and in 1922 was
given honorable mention on the late
Walter Camp's all-American selec
tions. After his graduation in that
year he played basketball with the
Kansas City A.C., and in 1923 was a
member of the national champion
ship five.
The California mentor's first grad
uate experience began in 1924 when
he became assistant football coach
at Westminister College. He spent
his spare time as an instructor in
history. He introduced track com
petition there, and for five years,
from 1925 to 1929, inclusive, won the
Missouri College championship.
Born in Missouri
Hamilton, who was born in Pe
:uliar, Missouri, is now 34 years of
lge. He is married and has a 6-
year-old daughter.
Several prominent American ath
.etes owe their start and much of
heir present fame to the early train
ing of Hamilton. Glenn Cunning
ham, premier miler who has nego
tiated the distance in 4:08.2, was
recovering from severe leg burns
when Hamilton advised him to start
in running competition.
Advised Champions
Three Olympic decathalon aces,
Jim Bausch, winner .of the 1932, title;
Wilson Charles, and James Cough
man, leading contenders, both ob
tained advice and training from the
present Bear mentor.
Captain Lyle Reynolds' case is a
mystery on the Blue and Gold cam
pus. As a junior. Reynolds traveled
the half-mile route in close to 1:57
many times. This spring he has been
unable to approach his past marks.
The Bear captain was handicapped
by illness early in the year, but on
his return he was defeated by team
mates Dick Brace, Clark Hickerson,
and Charlie Moore.

"Resurrector of track and field at
the University oi California" is the
title bestowed on Brutus Hamilton,
who in two years has brought the
Bear cindermen from the lowest
ranks of the Coast to one of the
highest.
Succeeding Walter Christie, who

Blue and Gold track men for 31
years, Hamilton arrived in Berkeley
last spring. He immediately was
tendered a three-year contract by
the A.S.U.C.
Coaches at Kansas

coach of the University of Kansas
where he enjoyed many successful
seasons. In 1930 and 1931, his first
two years there, his teams won the
"Big Six" championship, while in
1932 his squad finished third. He
lost only two duals meets while
teaching Midwesterners, and both
were to Nebraska.
The genial Bear mentor had the
distinction of being a member of
two United States Olympic teams,
competing in 1920 and 1924. Hamil
ton won second place in the de

petition there, and for five years,
from 1925 to 1929, inclusive, won the
Missouri College championship.
Born in Missouri

:uliar, Missouri, is now 34 years of

recovering from severe leg burns
when Hamilton advised him to start
in running competition.

man, leading contenders, both ob
tained advice and training from the
present Bear mentor.

the half-mile route in close to 1:57
many times. This spring he has been
unable to approach his past marks.
