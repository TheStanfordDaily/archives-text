# TEN POINTS FIGURED FOR CAPTAIN MEIER
## 
### Millard Browne 
Ten pointsâ€”that's what the dope
j sters figure for Captain Gus Meier
lof Stanford against California to
l morrow afternoon.
And 10 points Meier probably will
j earn, barring a continuation of civil
! war between Stanford's Meier-Sam
Klopstock hurdling duo.
Meier is in the midst of his third,
I final, and possibly most sensational
| year of competition on the Indian
i varsity. He already claims a tie for
i the world's record in the 120-yard
J high hurdies of 14.2 seconds, and he
! shows possibilities of again equaling
i or even beating this mark before he
, hangs up his spikes for the summer.
Fast Race in Lows
Always slow to get into shape, the
genial Cardinal leader is already at
| his all-time best in the low barrier
' event. Last week, with u race into
the wind of 23.0 seconds, Meier came
i within one-tenth of a second of the
Stanford record, set by Podge Smith
in '31 and equaled by Colto Her
bert last year at 23.5 seconds.
Meier entered Stanford from Cit
rus High School. He first ran the
hurdles while a prep senior, and he
placed fifth in the state high school
I meet. As a freshman here, the pres
ent captain hurdled a bit and high
jumped to a tie for first in the "Lit
tle Big Meet."
Improves Consistently
He has improved his time in the
high sticks every year since he en
tered the University.
After a slow start last year, Gus
won the highs at the Fresno relays
in 14.5 seconds, and he was not con
sidered capable of much further im
provement, at least until this year.
However, in the final meet of the
season, he won the race at the N.C.
A.A. in 14.2 seconds, equalling Percy
I Beard's world record.
After having recovered from a
slight cold that placed him in the
rest home for two days this week,
the Stanford captain is ready to
make those 10 points tomorrow, and,
weather permitting, his times in
both events may occasion a head
line or two.
