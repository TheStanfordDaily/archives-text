# CAPTAIN REYNOLDS OF U.C. VARSITY NOT LISTED TO WIN IN TOMORROW'S 880 RUN
## 
### 
Captain Lyle Reynolds of the 1934
California varsity is typical of the
hard-working Blue and Gold ath
letes who have come a long way
under the tutelage 01 Coach Brutus
Hamilton.
Reynolds, who is not even slated
for a place in the 880 tomorrow but
who won the event last year, did his
first running for Manteca High in the
San Joaquin Valley. His first two
years of college were spent at Mo
desto J.C., where he continued his
track work, but ran only second
man for the Pirate and never man
aged to come within a couple of sec
onds of two flat for the two-lap race.
Upon transferring to U.C. and
coming under the guidance of Ham
ilton, however, Reynold's improve
ment was almost immediate. He won
the majority of his races during the
practice meets last year and cli
maxed a successful season by win
ning the Big Meet half-mile in 1:59.
While Reynolds has been forced

to follow his teammates Brace and
Hickerson to the tape this season,
he will be giving his best for a Cali
fornia sweep of the 880, probably
setting a fast pace and letting BiacÂ« i
and Hickerson lake the honors with
their speed on the final straight
away.
