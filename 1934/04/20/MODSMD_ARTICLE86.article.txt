The following statement was given

left for the East:
"I have been asked two questions:
1. 'Can a campus vote of the
women put the sororities off the
campus?'
''The University has stated that j
the sororities cannot be put off the
campus by a campus vote of the
women, but that the sororities, if j
they are put off the campus except I
for disciplinary reasons, must vote
themselves off.
2. 'If the sororities should decide
at any time to withdraw their char
ters how would it affect the hous
ing problem?'
"The University would take over J
the sorority houses at a fair evalu- |
ation and would run those that are j
geographically together as a group
residence. Such a plan would not
be difficult to carry out and would
have promise of genuine success." ,
