of 1934 tomorrow afternoon Coach
Harry Wolter of the Stanford var
sity will have closed his sixteenth
year of coaching Card nines and
his twenty-eighth as an active par
ticipant in America's greatest pas
time.
Although the last league cham
pionship won by a Stanford nine
was in 1931, and although the 1934
season, which looked so promising
in February has been a real dis
appointment to Card baseball fans,'
YVolter's niche on the Farm has been j
gained through something more |
than the genial and democratic per- I
sonality that has led Indian base
ball for a decade and a half. Stan
ford may not get the type of boy |
that has spent the spare time of a
youth playing sand-lot baseball,
but Harry Wolter's years of prac
tical experience on the diamond
have enabled him to build strong
nines around the small nucleus of
experienced players thai annually
report to him in the Sunken. Dia
