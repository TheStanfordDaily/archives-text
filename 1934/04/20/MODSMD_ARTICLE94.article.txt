Discussing changes of clauses which brought about the defeat of the
proposed A.S.S.U. constitution Tuesday, the new Constitution Revision
Committee met last night with Student Body President Jerry Trautman.
Items which were opposed by many students were tentatively revised, and
steps were taken for public hearings on the revised document as soon as it
is ready for presentation.

p Ten clauses in all were discussed,
I and on all but three of them deci
! sions were reached. Complaints from
j those interested in other parts of the
constitution will be heard next week,
j and efforts will be made to have it
I ready for a vote the following week,
A nearmg following Ex Committee
; meeting Tuesday night, a Forum on
I Wednesday, and an all-University
| assembly on Thursday will serve to
hear complaints and to explain
changes in the constitution which
was defeated.
The first hearing will be at 8:30
o'clock Tuesday in the Ex Commit
tee room, and those with complaints
not affected by changes made by
them may speak. Those who wish to
speak at Wednesday's Forum may
hand in their names and subject to
President Trautman's office in writ
ing.
Complaints on which the student
does not wish to speak may be
handed in in writing, and they will
be considered by the committee.
Trautman stressed the necessity of
co-operation by dissatisfied students
with committee members by making
complaints so that clauses may be
considered before a second ballot. |
