# ROTH SAYS NEW LIGHT FALLS ON QUEEN KIDNAP'
## Comptroller Claims San Francisco Paper Knew of Affair In Advance; Authorities Deem Hoax More Serious Than Practical Joke 
### 
"Just a stunt that looked spectacular but went sour," is the present
opinion of Comptroller Almon E. Roth concerning the kidnapping Friday
of Queen Eleanor Harris, ruler of the Rally Committee's Masque Ball
Friday night.
Considerable progress has been made learning the identity of
the perpetrators and Roth's investigation is going forward; the administra
tion considers the affair more serious than a practical joke.

â€¢ Any student found to be involved
"will be subject to drastic disciplin
ary action," Edgar E. Robinson, act
ing president, said in a statement
yesterday.
The ball queen was taken from the
Kappa Alpha Theta house Friday
morning and held prisoner within a
few miles of the campus for 13
hours, then released in time to pre
side at the Masque Ball in the eve
ning.
Photographer Calls
Early Friday a photographer made
an appointment to take Miss Harris'
picture; he came to the Theta house
and she left with him in a black se
dan. She said he told her he was
going to pick up Bob McClure, ball
king, for a group picture, but in
stead, he turned away from the
campus.
Then, Queen Eleanor said, a blan
ket was thrown over her head; two
other men jumped into the car a
moment later, and after 10 minutes
they arrived at the house where she
was held captive.
She said she was blindfolded all
day. The abductors, she told author
ities, treated her with every con
sideration.
Walks Home
She was released near the Ryan
high voltage laboratory and walked
back to the Theta house in time to
dress for the ball.
Last night the victimized queen
said she believed the kidnaping
"merely a prank." Her abductors,
she said, were "just kids" about 19
years old.
While she was held captive she
said a reporter from a metropolitan
newspaper came to the house and
interviewed her. Miss Harris said
she did not suspect the San Fran
cisco paper of complicity.
Campus authorities share this
opinion, but state that they have in
formation that the newspaper knew
of the "stunt" in advance; this pos
sible complicity is being investi
gated.
Photo Traced
Roth said, "I was rather amused
by the statement in The Examiner
that authorities were without a clue
as to how a photograph of Miss Har
ris in the hands of the kidnapers got
to the office of that paper. We have
full information in detail as to ex
actly how the picture reached the
newspaper office."
There was no apparent reason for
the kidnaping. Both Miss Harris
and Comptroller Roth were at a loss
for a possible motive.
In answer to a rumor on the cam
pus that the hoax may have been
publicity stunt, for the Masque Bali,
Rally Committeemen said they re
sented the inference and were taking
the initiative as far as possible to
investigate the affair. Chairman Stan
Beaubaire said the committee would
do as much as it could to find out
what, if any, students were involved.
