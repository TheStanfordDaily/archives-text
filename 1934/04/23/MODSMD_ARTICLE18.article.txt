# SMASHING VICTORY OVER U.C. BOOSTS CARD TRACK HOPES
## Indian Frosh Receive 88-43 Beating in Friday s "Little Big Meet" BEAR CUBS SURPRISE Reynolds Betters Lyman's Frosh Shot Mark 
### Warren Breed 
It was a case of 22 willing Bear
frosh under the guiding hand of
Coach Brutus Hamilton that spelled
defeat for the Stanford frosh Friday
afternoon at Berkeley, 88 to 43. Ham
ilton took men who had never worn
spikes before, and converted them
into point winners, and his cubs
were not hesitant to give him the
credit.
Just as "Chuck" Nimmo and John
Lyman inspired the Stanford varsity
to decisive victory in the Big Meet,
so it was the mile win of Les Vooh
heis that was the Bear spark-plug to
winning performances. He won by a
scant yard from Indian Captain
Rusty March, after showing a sur
prise sprint that carried him under
the wire in the best time of his ca
reer. Rusty matched him stride for
stride for the last 220, but Voor
heis' early lead was the margin of
victory.
The best race of the day was in the
880, where a Hamilton-coached nov
ice, Bob Heavey, finished a couple
of strides in front of Indians' Bill
McCurdy and Box Alexander in fast
time.
Three meet records were eclipsed
â€”the 100, 220, and shot, and one, the
low hurdles, was tied. George An
derson, Cub flyer, shattered both
sprint marks, Bob Kiesel's century
record by two-tenths of a second,
and the 220 by a full second. Jim
Reynolds broke John Lyman's frosh
heave by a fraction of an inch, fol
lowed by teammates Bergman and
Ledbetter for the lone Card sweep.
Ernie Evans, the Papoose who was
doped to win one or both of the hur
dle races, had all the tough luck of
the day, bashing over hurdles in
both races, after being even to the
Bears in both.
Paul Green looked like future var
sity calibre in winning the quarter
in 50.2, followed by Alex Faye in his
first 440 of the season. Ray William
son took a second though handi
capped by a sore arm, while George
Bergman, big football-eenter-shot
putter, took second in the broad
jump on his first leap of the year.
