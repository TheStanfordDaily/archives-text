# Leave System Vote Is Asked
## New Committee to Discuss Amendments to Plan 
### 
Basing their opposition to the
women's new late leave system on
the fact that such a plan would
place too heavy restrictions on the 1
"800," numerous women's living
groups on the campus have begun to |
circulate petitions. The principal de
mand made by these petitions is a
request for an individual vote, rather
than a vote by group.
Speaking for Women's Council, ]
Elinor Kahn, junior member, stated |
last night that as soon as Jeanne
Millard, president, returns from her i
leave of absence, she will appoint a j
committee composed of Women's
Conference and the presidents of the i
living groups to discuss the matter j
of an amendment to the plan.
All complaints are to be submit
ted to this committee, which will
report its findings to Dean Yost for '
approval. The changes, if made, will
then be sent to Conference for final j
approbation before public vote.
The new system, which is to go j
into effect next fall, restricts the |
number of 2:30 o'clock, passes per |
week, instead of the present un
limited late leaves on week-ends, i
The purpose of this is to raise the I
scholarship average of the women.
