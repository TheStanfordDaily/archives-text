# Lyman's Record Throw In Shot Put Features 81-50 Big Meet
## WIN ELEVEN STRAIGHT Card Trackmen Score Many Unexpected Points 
### Jack Drown 
At a few minutes before 2 o'clock
last Saturday in the Stanford Sta
dium, a time prior to the arrival of
many spectators, John Lyman of
Stanford stepped into the shot-put
ring and on. his first effort of the
afternoon heaved the 16-pound mass
of metal 54 feet 1 inch to shatter
eveiy existing record for the event,
eithel official or unofficial.
Lyman's magnificent put broke
by one-half inch less than a foot the
recognized world's mark of 53 feet
l inches held by Frantisek Douda
of Czechoslovakia, and far over
shadowed a toss of 53 feet 6V2 inches
also made last Saturday by Jack
Torrance of Louisiana State.
Inspires Teammates
However, Lyman did more than
to set a new world's record when he
sent the iron pellet hurtling through
the atmosphere farther than man has
ever before done in actual competi
tion. He inspired a group of Stanford
athletes to produce such startling
performances and to come through
for places in events where they were
supposed to be shut out so well,
that the Cardinals of Coach Dink
Templeton defeated Coach Brutus
Hamilton's Californians by an 81 to
50 score and virtually made a rout
of what dopesters had predicted
would be the closest Big Meet in
years.
Saturday's victory was the elev
enth straight win for Stanford, which
has won every Big Meet since 1923
when the Bears won, 82V2 to 48 1 â€¢>.
Naturally Lyman set a new Big
Meet record, breaking Harlow Roth
ert's mark of 51 feet 10% inches set
by the Stanford star in 1930, but
Rothert's record was only one of
four to fall.
Klopstock Stars
Sophomore Sam Klopstock of
Stanford, running as pcrfect a flight
of high hurdles as has ever been wit
nessed in these parts, bucked a
strong head wind to establish a new
Big Meet mark of 14.5 seconds for
the 120-yard obstacle race, fractur
ing the record made by Ross Nich
ols of Stanford in 1928. Klopstock
returned to the track an hour later
to tie with Captain Meier in a 24
seconds Hat flight of low barriers,
good time against the strong head
wind.
The four-man mile relay resulted
in the erasing of the third track rec
ord. Stanford's team of Dear, Bur
ns, Dellinger, and Blackntan roared
around the quarter-mile oval four
times to win from a Bear quartet in
the excellent time of 3:15.5, leading
by 15 yards and sending into the
discard the mark of 3:17.8 hung up
in 1931 by the Stanford team of
Shove, Howell, Hables, and Ben
Eastman.
Zachcs Comes Through
The other x - ecord to fall in the
broad jump when Rother Clark of
California leaped 24 feet 4',k inches
to better the performance of Stan
ford's Virgil Dowell in 1929.
So much for the records. It was to
the unsung heroes that much of the
credit should go for sending th<
Bear home on the short end of the
score.
Outstanding among these were
Paul Zaches, Jimmy Willson, and
Phil Williams.
Dellinger Gritty
Of no less importance was Blower
Dellinger, gritty quarter-miler who
battled into third place in the quar
ter-mile for the Cards, the event
being won by Stanford's great 440
man, A1 Blackman.
And don't forget Bill Beatty, who
beat out fhe Bear's Fitzgerald to
place second to teammate Mottrom
in the javelin, and Art Azevedo, who
ran a determined race in the two
mile to prevent a California clean
sweep.
"Chuck" Nimmo won the opening
track event, the mile run, from Red
Raftery, the California ace, by 30
yards in the good time of 4:23.5, and
missed winning the half-mile by a
whisker, when Dick Brace of the
visitors barely caught him at the
finish to win in 1:55.6.
