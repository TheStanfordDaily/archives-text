# Time to Call a Halt

### 
The practical joke of somebody's immature mind which
was perpetrated on this campus Friday is in the midst of
being thoroughly investigated, and when authorities reach
their conclusion as to the guilty parties, the Daily trusjs
that severe punishment will he dealt out.
When people go so far as to hurt the good names of
others, cause parents no end of worry, and.take the time
of police who are employed to protect the public against
breaches of justice, it is high time that they are made to
receive as much as they gave in the way of trouble.
The Daily has no sympathy with these individuals,
whoever they may be. We offer our fullest co-operation to
the authorities, with the hopes that a solution may be
readied as rapidly as possible and that people now impli
cated mav be cleared of anv false accusations.
