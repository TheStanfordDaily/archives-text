Alumni, faculty, and students got together last week
end and enjoyed themselves to the utmost while the cam
pus provided thrills and excitement for all.
Water Carnival, stag dinners, football scrimmage,
Masque Hall, departmental conclaves, and other entertain
ment climaxed by a grand Big Meet with its outstanding
performances all combined to show the Old Grad just
what the Farm has to offer today. Of course, kidnaping
gags aren't a normal occurrence, and really aren't to be
encouraged as such.
Anyway, it was a great idea, and the Alumni Associa
tion and those who helped plan the eventful program are
to be congratulated for their successful efforts. It's a good
lime right now to consider the success of this IJKM reunion,
and plan today for an even greater homecoming in 1935.
It has been a long time since Stanford alumni have
been "Hack to the Farm" like this, and Ihe sooner it hap
pens again Ihe more fun we will all have.
