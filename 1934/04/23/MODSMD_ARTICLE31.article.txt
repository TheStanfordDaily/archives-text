The Rig Meet, after all, is just another track meet when
you get do\vn to the core of it. Hut you can't tell a Cali
fornia or Stanford man or a sports writer that anil make
him believe it.
There is a certain excitement about a Rig Meet that
starts sports writers thumbing through the "Publicity
Man's Handbook of Household Superlatives" and sets
alumni humming victory songs. Saturday about twelve
thousand newspapermen and alumni saw the Stanford
team, that entered the arena a very, very slight favorite to
win, win the forty-first Rig Meet eighty-one to fifty.
It was colossal. II was stupendous.
