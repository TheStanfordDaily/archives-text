# Co-operation Necessary
## 
### 
Within the last few weeks, the I)\ii.y has been forced
lo withhold from publication many campus opinions be
cause of their length. We are more than willing to allow
students lo put their thoughts in print, but it is necessary
that they co-operate with us in order that any sudden in
flux of letters can be handled properly.
Space does not permit Campus Opinion letters lo ex
ceed 200 words. If you will co-operate with us in keeping
them lo that length, we will co-operate with you in print
ing them, if they are printable.
