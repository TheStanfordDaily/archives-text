# BULL SESSION
## STARS OR MEN? 
### 
Arthur Brisbane, once the finest
columnist in America, declares that
the most important happening of the
last 25 years is the making of the
new 17-foot diametered telescope
lens "that will carry the sight and
intellect of man two billion light
years into space."
Now past 70, and having written
many years for the Hearst chain, Mr.
Brisbane has a right to be interested
in what lies far out into space. That
is only intelligent self-interest. But
for those of us who are still actively
kicking up the dust instead of biting
it, there have been far more im
portant events in the last quarter
century.
For Americans, we believe that the
two most significant events during
the period were the passage of In
come Tax Amendment and the elec
tion into office of the New Deal.
Neither the Amendment nor the
Deal have been altogether success
ful. In fact there are many stiff
collars, and a few soft ones that be
lieve both are unqualified failures.
But in the midst of a money-mad
society, the XVJ amendment and the
"bloodless revolution" have been the

two most successful attempts to ad
just that maladjusted money mania.
Perhaps there are acres of dia
monds on Mars, or fields of platinum
on Uranus that would make even
red Russians turn green with envy.
What if the new telescope would let
us see those fields, and a new Lind
bergh could reach them—and re
turn? Would that be important?
About as important as the nit on the
nose of a gnat.
The wealth of Mellon, plus the
touch of Midas are completely
worthless, if we do not know how to
use them. The amendment, and this
New Deal have indicated how money
should be used. If money is not for
men to use —to live on, then it would
I be far better that all the money in
the world be on Uranus, and all the
people in the world be on Atlantis
(which sunk many years since).
No, the Income Tax Amendment
is not an absolute success. And the
New Deal is far from a success. But
they have pointed the path. It is a
choice of bloodless or bloody revo
lution. Shall we think of men or
stars? —Dave Mellinkoff

come Tax Amendment and the elec
tion into office of the New Deal.
Neither the Amendment nor the
Deal have been altogether success
ful. In fact there are many stiff
collars, and a few soft ones that be
lieve both are unqualified failures.
But in the midst of a money-mad
society, the XVJ amendment and the
"bloodless revolution" have been the

two most successful attempts to ad
just that maladjusted money mania.
Perhaps there are acres of dia
monds on Mars, or fields of platinum
on Uranus that would make even
red Russians turn green with envy.
What if the new telescope would let
us see those fields, and a new Lind
bergh could reach them—and re
turn? Would that be important?
About as important as the nit on the
nose of a gnat.
The wealth of Mellon, plus the
touch of Midas are completely
worthless, if we do not know how to
use them. The amendment, and this
New Deal have indicated how money
should be used. If money is not for
men to use —to live on, then it would
I be far better that all the money in
the world be on Uranus, and all the
people in the world be on Atlantis
(which sunk many years since).
No, the Income Tax Amendment
is not an absolute success. And the
New Deal is far from a success. But
they have pointed the path. It is a
choice of bloodless or bloody revo
lution. Shall we think of men or
stars? —Dave Mellinkoff
