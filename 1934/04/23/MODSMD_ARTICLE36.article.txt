# WHY IT'S NEWS
## By CROMPTON BANCS Jr. Reds — And Strikes 
### 
California's open season for agri
cultural strikes is here. Most county
and some state authorities think they
are started by Red agitators from
outside. So they have declared an
open season on Communist organi
zers. The game is to be captured
and jailed by the handiest means—
fair or foul, legal or extra-legal.
Now if the state and its counties
want to foster the growth of Com
munism this is an excellent idea. As
long as an agitator can point an ac
cusing and wrathful finger at anti
picketing ordinances and kidnaped
lawyers he will have a good talking
point. Strikes will keep on happen
ing as long as county and state offi
cers defend American principles by
violating them.

The latest report on the strike sit
uation urges that lawyers defending
the strikers be investigated—which
usually means intimidated. If this
is carried out, it will mean that one
sided justice will stay with us; so
will the strikes; so will bloodshed.
Nobody wants these strikes to oc
cur; nobody gains much by them.
The only way to go at the question
is to do it in a friendly and open way
so both sides can see what is going
on. Where there is justice there is
seldom an agitator. There's nothing
for him to talk about.
The sooner both growers and pick

ers see they are in the same boat,
the sooner we can get rid of strikes.
Both of them should see that they
are both victims of low prices, high
interest rates, high taxes, and high
transportation costs. They have a
great deal in common; if they want
better times, they should organize
together—not against each other.
The U.S. Way vs. the County Way
If the state gets our bigger and
better steamrollers to flatten Com
munist organizers, it will of course
play right into their hands. It will
also bump the Federal government,
trying to keep strikes at a minimum.
The U.S. forces say the reason
strikes happen is that conditions are
terrible. Remove these conditions
and you remove the strike evil. So
far, the U.S. way has worked best.
The Federal forccs are very much
anti-strong-arm and pro-civil-lib
erty. They feel the existing county
laws and officers encourage strikes
and give the Communists just what
they want. Sooner or later, the U.S.
will have to settle strikes which
cannot be fairly settled because of
local pressure politics and local
minds. The sooner the better.

play right into their hands. It will
also bump the Federal government,
trying to keep strikes at a minimum.
The U.S. forces say the reason
strikes happen is that conditions are
terrible. Remove these conditions
and you remove the strike evil. So
far, the U.S. way has worked best.
The Federal forccs are very much
anti-strong-arm and pro-civil-lib
erty. They feel the existing county
laws and officers encourage strikes
and give the Communists just what
they want. Sooner or later, the U.S.
will have to settle strikes which
cannot be fairly settled because of
local pressure politics and local
minds. The sooner the better.
California's open season for agri
cultural strikes is here. Most county
and some state authorities think they
are started by Red agitators from
outside. So they have declared an
open season on Communist organi
zers. The game is to be captured
and jailed by the handiest means—
fair or foul, legal or extra-legal.
Now if the state and its counties
want to foster the growth of Com
munism this is an excellent idea. As
long as an agitator can point an ac
cusing and wrathful finger at anti
picketing ordinances and kidnaped
lawyers he will have a good talking
point. Strikes will keep on happen
ing as long as county and state offi
cers defend American principles by
violating them.
No Liberty for Lawyers
The latest report on the strike sit
uation urges that lawyers defending
the strikers be investigated—which
usually means intimidated. If this
is carried out, it will mean that one
sided justice will stay with us; so
will the strikes; so will bloodshed.
Nobody wants these strikes to oc
cur; nobody gains much by them.
The only way to go at the question
is to do it in a friendly and open way
so both sides can see what is going
on. Where there is justice there is
seldom an agitator. There's nothing
for him to talk about.
The sooner both growers and pick

ers see they are in the same boat,
the sooner we can get rid of strikes.
Both of them should see that they
are both victims of low prices, high
interest rates, high taxes, and high
transportation costs. They have a
great deal in common; if they want
better times, they should organize
together—not against each other.
The U.S. Way vs. the County Way
If the state gets our bigger and
better steamrollers to flatten Com
munist organizers, it will of course
play right into their hands. It will
also bump the Federal government,
trying to keep strikes at a minimum.
