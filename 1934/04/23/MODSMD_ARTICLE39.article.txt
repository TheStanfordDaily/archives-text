# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Some time ago a commission was
formed by the A.W.S. in an effort to
determine whether or not sororities
are worthy of the pldce they hold on
the Stanford campus. The report of
this commission was very ably pxe
sented to the student body in last
Friday's Daily in the hope that in
telligent comment and criticism
might be forthcoming.
It is axi interesting index to the
lethargy of the student body to note
that although months were spent in
the preparation of the commission's
report in the hope that some reason
able reaction might shed a little 1 ighL
on the question, up to the present
time pro-sorority students have con
tented themselves with affecting a
rather medieval policy of indiffer
ence and anti-sorovity partisians
have shown an equally if not more
medieval attitude of inactivity.
My purpose is not to express my
own viewpoint in the matter; it is
to point out to pro-sorority people
that there are actually conscientious
individuaLs who object to fraternal
organizations as a matter of principle
and not because of envy, and to call
the attention of those opposed to
fraternal organizations to the fact
that there are people who think thai
the only opposition to fraternities
and sororities is a manifestation 'of
an inferiority complex.
The problem before the student
body is neither a church reform nor
a birth control campaign.
It need not be discussed in hushed
tones. â€”Beau Kitselman
