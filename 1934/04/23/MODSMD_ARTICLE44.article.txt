COME THROUGH BOYS
PUT CARDS ON TOP
The come through athletes brought
Stanford through again Saturday
even beyond the wildest predictions
«>f the Indians' most optimistic sup
porters. Last season when Stanford
nosed out U.S.C.'s national cham
pions it was the unexpected points
of such men as Mottram, Zaches,
Williams, and Schwccn that put the
Cards on top.
Saturday a new crop of come
through artists clinched the meet
Jr Stanford. Zaches repeated his
performance of last season against
Troy by placing second to Clarke in
the broad jump, but the rest of the
unexpected points came from men
who hadn't figured in the money
before.
WLLSON'S RACE
icEAL TREAT
It was a real treat to see Jimmy
Willson come through with a point
in the 100-yard dash after so many
disappointments. Touted as the
greatest prep sprinter ever de
veloped in Southern California when
he graduated from San Diego and
•rice picked on the All-American
Scholastic team, Willson had been
handicapped throughout his college
career by injuries.
"Truck" DclHngcr, the sophomore
quarter-miler, was another who
brought in unexpected points. His
trreat finish in the 440 after appar
ently tieing up in the first 220 was a
line display of courage, and then he
came hack to do the same thing in
the relay, giving A1 Blackmail an
unexpected lead for the last lap. The
whole relay team of Dear, Burris,
Bellinger, and Blacknian must he
included in the list of come through
Metes.
Phil Williams, the broad jumper j
who went unplaced, is another who |
came through with an unexpected j
point by taking a third in the 220
while Bill Beatty's feat of nosing out
Fitzgerald for second in the javelin, j
sore arm and all, when he wasn't
v r eti figured to place, was another
highlight. Buller's third in the dis
cus was another undoped place
which allowed Stanford to sweep the I
event.
LYMAN, NIMMO
START DAY
That record-breaking toss of John
'..yman's in his first throw in the
shot-put and little Chuck Nimmo's
race in the mile, the first track event, '
started the Indians off on the right
foot. Everyone was pulling for Ly
man to break the world record offi
cially after his xinoflicial throw of
53 feel G inches a week ago, but. no
ne dreamed of a mark of 54 feet.
Dopesters had also looked for a
hair-raising finish in the mile be
tween Nimmo and Raflery, but after
trailing the red-headed Bear and his
teammate, Kitchell, for the first
three laps, "Little Chuck" began to
open up just before the start of the
urfh lap and uncorked a sprint on
the backstretcli, holding it all the
way in, which left Raftery far in the
rear. Just to make the day com
pleted, Nimmo came hack to almost
beat out Brace for first in the 880 in 4
faster time than he had ever run he
fore.
Sam Klopstock, although his per
formance didn't bring in any more
points than Stanford had counted on
in the hurdles, served notice that he
must be ranked with the nation's
best by beating Captain Gus Meier
in the highs in 14.5, incidentally set
ting a new Big Meet mark, and then
facing him a dead heat in the lows
Mi 24 fiat.
In praising the performance of
those unexpected point getters, such
men whose points were counted on
in pre-meet dope as Mottram, Meier,
Blackman, Thorns, Deacon, Schween,
Arthur, and Dunn must not be for
gotten, for without them the unex
pected seconds and thirds wouldn't
have helped much. —Tremaine

WLLSON'S RACE
icEAL TREAT
It was a real treat to see Jimmy
Willson come through with a point
in the 100-yard dash after so many
disappointments. Touted as the
greatest prep sprinter ever de
veloped in Southern California when
he graduated from San Diego and
•rice picked on the All-American
Scholastic team, Willson had been
handicapped throughout his college
career by injuries.
"Truck" DclHngcr, the sophomore
quarter-miler, was another who
brought in unexpected points. His
trreat finish in the 440 after appar
ently tieing up in the first 220 was a
line display of courage, and then he
came hack to do the same thing in
the relay, giving A1 Blackmail an
unexpected lead for the last lap. The
whole relay team of Dear, Burris,
Bellinger, and Blacknian must he
included in the list of come through
Metes.
Phil Williams, the broad jumper j
who went unplaced, is another who |
came through with an unexpected j
point by taking a third in the 220
while Bill Beatty's feat of nosing out
Fitzgerald for second in the javelin, j
sore arm and all, when he wasn't
v r eti figured to place, was another
highlight. Buller's third in the dis
cus was another undoped place
which allowed Stanford to sweep the I
event.
LYMAN, NIMMO
START DAY
That record-breaking toss of John
'..yman's in his first throw in the
shot-put and little Chuck Nimmo's
race in the mile, the first track event, '
started the Indians off on the right
foot. Everyone was pulling for Ly
man to break the world record offi
cially after his xinoflicial throw of
53 feel G inches a week ago, but. no
ne dreamed of a mark of 54 feet.
Dopesters had also looked for a
hair-raising finish in the mile be
tween Nimmo and Raflery, but after
trailing the red-headed Bear and his
teammate, Kitchell, for the first
three laps, "Little Chuck" began to
open up just before the start of the
urfh lap and uncorked a sprint on
the backstretcli, holding it all the
way in, which left Raftery far in the
rear. Just to make the day com
pleted, Nimmo came hack to almost
beat out Brace for first in the 880 in 4
faster time than he had ever run he
fore.
Sam Klopstock, although his per
formance didn't bring in any more
points than Stanford had counted on
in the hurdles, served notice that he
must be ranked with the nation's
best by beating Captain Gus Meier
in the highs in 14.5, incidentally set
ting a new Big Meet mark, and then
facing him a dead heat in the lows
Mi 24 fiat.
In praising the performance of
those unexpected point getters, such
men whose points were counted on
in pre-meet dope as Mottram, Meier,
Blackman, Thorns, Deacon, Schween,
Arthur, and Dunn must not be for
gotten, for without them the unex

have helped much. —Tremaine
