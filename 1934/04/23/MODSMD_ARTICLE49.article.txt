# GOLFERS DROP U.C. MATCHES WITH WEAK DOUBLES PLAY; FROSH TRIM CURS EASILY
## 
### 
Inability of the second string of
Stanford's varsity golf team to win
from California's first string the
small number of points required for
a victory was the cause of one of
the greatest upsets of the week-end
when the Bears won the annual
Stanford-California golf match by a
score of 14 to 13.
Stanford led the Bears by an 11 to
7 margin after the singles matches
were finished in the morning. They
needed to score only three points
out of the nine in the doubles
matches. Stanford's second team
was given the chance to play, but
couldn't deliver the necessary points,
though past individual performances
gave the Cards an edge.
The freshmen scored an easy 24 1/ 2
to 2V2 win.
