# BEAR NETMEN LICK CARDS IN SATURDAY MATCH, 6-3
## 
### 
Concluding what has been one of
the most unsuccessful Indian tennis
seasons in five years, California net
men defeated Stanford Saturday
morning by a match score of six
matche.s to three.
In the first singles match, Otis,
playing as excellent tennis as has
been seen on the varsity courts this
year, and continuing his work against
Tidball last week, defeated Gene
Smith, California captain, in straight
sets, 6-1, 8-6. The match was not
even as close as the score indicates;
Otis was superior throughout, and
avenged his defeat from the hands
of Smith last month. In the second
singles, John Law had Carl Holmes,
steady Bear netman, five games to
two in the first set, only to lose both
that set and the match, 8-6, 6-3.
Brown Wins
The prettiest match of the day
saw Shwayder of Stanford pitted
against Harold Brown of the Bears
in the third singles. Shwayder was
playing three positions higher than
at the beginning of the season. His
play in the base court, and volleying
at the net were a hundred per cent
improved â€¢ over his earlier season
form. Brown, a ranking junior, took
the first set, Shwayder outplayed

him to win the second, ancL after a
tough time Brown captured the third
and final set. Scores were 6-4, 3-6,
7-5.
Dan Clark won the only other
singles of the day for Stanford when
he defeated Bakulitch of California,
4-0, 6-3, 6-4. Clark played excel
lently, outsmarting a man who was
favored to defeat hirti.
Downey Defeated
Jack Downey played well, how
ever Harper Massie of the Bears was
far too steady for him, and he lost,
6-4, 6-2. In the final singles, Ray
Jadarela lost to Dunlop in easy sets.
There was no competition at any
time in this match.
In the doubles, Otis and Law play
ing together took down Holmes and
Smith, 6-4, 6-4. Although it was a
pretty match to watch, the Card net
men were far superior throughout,
Otis in particular making beautiful
volleys, while Law hit some drives
for clean placement aces that were
so hard they could not be seen
streaking down the alleys.
California's Brown and Massie
won over Martin and Downey in
straight sets, 6-3, 6-3, while in the
third doubles, the final score was
6-4, 8-6 in favor of California.
