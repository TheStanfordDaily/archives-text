# Brauns Given Title Role for Play Thursday
## Sword and Sandals Offers "George Barnwell" 
### James Sandoc 
To Robert Brauns, well-known
campus actor, lias fallen the dilli
cult and delicate task of portraying
the name role in next Thursday eve
ning's reading of Lillo's moral tra
gedy, "George Barnwell; or The
London Merchant." Dr. Merrel
Clubb, in announcing the cast of the
play, expressed particular satisfac
tion with Brauns' interpretation of
the part.
Milwood, unscrupulous adventu
ress, is to be read by Marian Jones,
also known *for her dramatic acti
vities hereabouts. Last year she was
the Linda of "Holiday" and since
she has been seen in readings of
"Hay Fever" and "She Sloops to
Conquer.'
Thomas Seller has been cast as the
merchant, Thorowgood. Seller's lirst
campus stage appearance was as Old
Tom in the recent reading of "S.S,
Glencairn." As Trueman, William
Knapp promises to shine virtuously.
Two newcomers to the Stanford
stage have been cast in the play.
Marjorie Melczer has been placed in
the pathetic role of Maria and Mary
Ann Wheeler will be seen as Mil
wood's maid, Lucy, who refuses to
follow her mistress upon the down
ward path. In the brief but atmos
pherically important character of
Barnwell's Uncle, Curt Zimansky
will have his first serious part. As
Throttlebottom in the reading "Of
Thee I Sing" last year he scored a
great personal success.
Meanwhile communications from
the faculty continue to pour in to
the offices of Sword and Sandals,
commending the selection of this
great drama. Dr. Margery Bailey of
the English Department has to say
of the play: "In the modern indif
ference to refined moral standards,
and the expense of spirit since the
repeal of prohibition in such maud
lin activities as golf and bridge, the
simple drama of George Barnwell's
loves and his murder of his uncle
comes with the force of lightning to
purify the campus attitude. Only
those who have labored long in
posts of responsibility connected
with the young of our nation can
realize the profound worth of this
moral tragedy of lust, loot, and love.

repeal of prohibition in such maud
lin activities as golf and bridge, the
simple drama of George Barnwell's
loves and his murder of his uncle
comes with the force of lightning to
purify the campus attitude. Only
those who have labored long in
posts of responsibility connected
with the young of our nation can
realize the profound worth of this
moral tragedy of lust, loot, and love.
