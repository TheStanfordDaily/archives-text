RIP TIDE (MOM)
At Hit: Stanford Theatre
It is by now a truism that Norma
Shearer never misses with a pic
ture, and "Rip Tide" is no exception.
"Rip Tide" is another in the star's
long succession of so-called smart
pictures about pleasantly un-moral
people, offering clever dialog and at
tractively modern sets and clothes.
That is the Shearer formula, which
''Rip Tide" follows, and yet the film
manages to be thoroughly enjoyable,
if not startlingly novel.
Miss Shearer plays Lady Rexford,
wife of Herbert Marshall, though she
loves her husband, she is momentar
ily indiscreet, and thus the re
mainder of the picture revolves
around their reconciliation. Obvi
ously, the picture's merit is not in
its story.
The merit lies in the rare finesse
with which the whole in handled.
The direction is exceptionally
smooth, and a fine pace is set and
maintained. This is partially due to
the excellently written dialogue,
which is so course delightfully
treated by the star and Robert Mont
gomery.
Miss Shearer gives her customary
polished performance, looks lovely,
and even if she doesn't do a great
deal of acting, it matters not at all.
Montgomery's insouciant Tommy
is one of ihe best of his noticeably
similar performances, and he is al
ways pleasant to watch. Herbert
Marshall makes the most of a rather
.stiff-necked role.
But Mrs. Pat Campbell is really
rather distressing in her part of the
dowager aunt, turning in a pretty
sloppy performance. —Chapin
YOU'RE TELLIN ME (Paramount)

In this picture W. C. Fields stalks
bitterly through many misadven
tures with spoons and spinsters,
door-knobs and drunkenness, to a

final fadeout which belies the ro
mantic promise of the so-called plot
upon which his incidents are based,
and leaves one limp and happy, hav
ing laughed a great deal more than
usual.
The plot, though completely
incredible, leaves one with the pleas
ant glow in which is usually the
aftermath of seeing the underdog
rewarded. Its payoff comes when a
princess, whom the inventor Fields
has met on a train, visits his home
and thus elevates his family to suf
ficient social prestige so that his
daughter is enabled to marry the son
of the town's leading citizens.
This sounds pretty silly, but de
spite the negative value of the young
lovers, the story seems only natural
after one has watched a few min
utes of the goofy things that can
happen to Mr. Fields. One is willing
to accept anything, so long as he will
continue to be'dissolute and ineffec
tual, while complaining of his ill
fortune in enchanting monotones.
Perhaps the golfing act,, which has
been his vaudeville stand-by for a
good many years, is a little too long
for a single picture incident. But
that is the only time when Fields is
on the scx-een when the picture
comes close to dragging, and then it
i., almost impossible to say what part
could have been cut.
Most of Fields' comedy depends,
not on the trick gadgets which his
roles as inventor enables him to in
troduce, but on the most accurate
and subtle timing and painstaking
thoroughness of motivation. Many a
movie comedian could observe and
learn. —Benet

YOU'RE TELLIN ME (Paramount)
At the Mountain View Theatre
In this picture W. C. Fields stalks
bitterly through many misadven
tures with spoons and spinsters,
door-knobs and drunkenness, to a

final fadeout which belies the ro
mantic promise of the so-called plot
upon which his incidents are based,
and leaves one limp and happy, hav
ing laughed a great deal more than
usual.
The plot, though completely
incredible, leaves one with the pleas
ant glow in which is usually the
aftermath of seeing the underdog
rewarded. Its payoff comes when a
princess, whom the inventor Fields
has met on a train, visits his home
and thus elevates his family to suf
ficient social prestige so that his
daughter is enabled to marry the son
of the town's leading citizens.
This sounds pretty silly, but de
spite the negative value of the young
lovers, the story seems only natural
after one has watched a few min
utes of the goofy things that can
happen to Mr. Fields. One is willing
to accept anything, so long as he will
continue to be'dissolute and ineffec
tual, while complaining of his ill
fortune in enchanting monotones.
Perhaps the golfing act,, which has
been his vaudeville stand-by for a
good many years, is a little too long
for a single picture incident. But
that is the only time when Fields is
on the scx-een when the picture
comes close to dragging, and then it
i., almost impossible to say what part
could have been cut.
Most of Fields' comedy depends,
not on the trick gadgets which his
roles as inventor enables him to in
troduce, but on the most accurate
and subtle timing and painstaking
thoroughness of motivation. Many a
movie comedian could observe and
learn. —Benet
RIP TIDE (MOM)
At Hit: Stanford Theatre
It is by now a truism that Norma
Shearer never misses with a pic
ture, and "Rip Tide" is no exception.
"Rip Tide" is another in the star's
long succession of so-called smart
pictures about pleasantly un-moral
people, offering clever dialog and at
tractively modern sets and clothes.
That is the Shearer formula, which
''Rip Tide" follows, and yet the film
manages to be thoroughly enjoyable,
if not startlingly novel.
Miss Shearer plays Lady Rexford,
wife of Herbert Marshall, though she
loves her husband, she is momentar
ily indiscreet, and thus the re
mainder of the picture revolves
around their reconciliation. Obvi
ously, the picture's merit is not in
its story.
The merit lies in the rare finesse
with which the whole in handled.
The direction is exceptionally
smooth, and a fine pace is set and
maintained. This is partially due to
the excellently written dialogue,
which is so course delightfully
treated by the star and Robert Mont
gomery.
Miss Shearer gives her customary
polished performance, looks lovely,
and even if she doesn't do a great
deal of acting, it matters not at all.
Montgomery's insouciant Tommy
is one of ihe best of his noticeably
similar performances, and he is al
ways pleasant to watch. Herbert
Marshall makes the most of a rather
.stiff-necked role.
