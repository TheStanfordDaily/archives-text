# Dr. Oldfather To Speak On Past Cultures
## Ancient and Modern Tastes To Be Compared 
### 
Dr. William A. Oldfather, profes
sor of Classics in the University of
Illinois, * will .speak tomorrow night
at 7:30 o'clock in the Little Theatre
on "The Levels of Culture: a com
parison of the mind and taste of the
common man in antiquity with those
of the common man of today."
The material on which Dr. Ofd
father has based his lecture has been
for the most part inscriptions and
papyri, which exist to the number of
some half million documents of all
sorts, from a period of 1,000 years.
"Because of this profusion of evi
dence," he has stated, "we can assess
the mind and taste of the common
man for this p*riod better than for
any other before or since." •
Literary culture was more widely
diffused than is commonly supposed
of ancient times. Illiteracy was rare,
except in Egypt. There was less
reading, but more memorizing of the
best that had been written. Business
records were briefer, more varied,
and more courteous than our own.
Private letters were shorter and
more restrained and to the point.
"It is absurd to regard its authors
or audience as lacking in any ele
ments of intelligence or good taste.
Ancient culture was not a thin ve
neer. Its great men were only the
common people, articulate and at
their best." •
Dr. Oldfather was appointed Sa
ther professor of Classical Literature
for the current semester at the Uni
versity of California where he has
been giving a series of lectures on
"The Decline of Culture within the
Roman Empire."
