## Administration Tries To Name Perpetrators Of "Hoax" Abduction HARRIS REQUESTIONED Men's, Women's Judicial Bodies Plan Probe 
### Millard Browne 
Already at work on various
"leads," the Men's and Women's
Councils began a student investiga
tion yesterday of the hoax kidnaping
last Friday of Eleanor Harris, queen
of the Masque Ball.
As a result of the kidnaping, be
lieved to be a "pi'actical joke gone
wrong," the Administration prom
ised drastic action when those re
sponsible are found. It was still
uncertain last night whether or not
any students were involved.
Roth Investigates
Since Friday, Comptroller Almon
E. Roth has been heading the cam
pus investigation. His force of Farm
police have partially cleared up the
matter, but the identity of the per
petrators was still unknown late
yesterday. Roth's investigation Sun
day involved a San Francisco news
paper.
Rally Committee reiterated yes
terday's statement that the group,
officially responsible for the Ball and
King contest, is making every pos
sible effort to learn the identity of
the kidnapers. The theory that the
kidnaping might have been a pos
sible publicity stunt for the affair,
after inviations were already sold
out, was scoffed at by leaders.
The Administration investigating
force devoted yesterday to running
down several clues, but little was
actually accomplished.
Each of the student councils held
meetings yesterday and began an in
dependent investigation. Gus Meier,
Men's Council head, said last night,
"We intend to got to the bottom
of it."
Councils Act
As a preliminary step in support
ing this statement, he intimated that
several solutions had been suggested
in the discussion at yesterday's
closed meeting. He said some names
had been mentioned in connection
with the case.
Miss Harris herself attended the
Women's Council meeting and went
over her story concerning the expe
rience. The women's group did not
learn any new facts that threw light
on the case, but the feminine coun
cil promised co-operation with the
men's organization in a comprehen
sive investigation.
U.S. Agents Probe
A third line of investigation was
rumored when several Federal De
partment of Justice agents from San
Francisco were seen on the campus
over the week-end. Their appear
ance may or may not have anything
to do with the case, it was pointed
out.
None of the investigators could of
fer a possible motive for the kid
naping, except that it was probably
inaugurated as a practical joke.

police have partially cleared up the
matter, but the identity of the per
petrators was still unknown late
yesterday. Roth's investigation Sun
day involved a San Francisco news
paper.
Rally Committee reiterated yes
terday's statement that the group,
officially responsible for the Ball and
King contest, is making every pos
sible effort to learn the identity of
the kidnapers. The theory that the
kidnaping might have been a pos
sible publicity stunt for the affair,
after inviations were already sold
out, was scoffed at by leaders.
The Administration investigating
force devoted yesterday to running
down several clues, but little was
actually accomplished.
Each of the student councils held
meetings yesterday and began an in
dependent investigation. Gus Meier,
Men's Council head, said last night,
"We intend to got to the bottom
of it."
Councils Act
As a preliminary step in support
ing this statement, he intimated that
several solutions had been suggested
in the discussion at yesterday's
closed meeting. He said some names
had been mentioned in connection
with the case.
Miss Harris herself attended the
Women's Council meeting and went
over her story concerning the expe
rience. The women's group did not

men's organization in a comprehen
sive investigation.

A third line of investigation was
rumored when several Federal De
partment of Justice agents from San
Francisco were seen on the campus
over the week-end. Their appear
ance may or may not have anything
to do with the case, it was pointed
out.
None of the investigators could of
fer a possible motive for the kid
naping, except that it was probably
inaugurated as a practical joke.
Already at work on various
"leads," the Men's and Women's
Councils began a student investiga
tion yesterday of the hoax kidnaping
last Friday of Eleanor Harris, queen
of the Masque Ball.
As a result of the kidnaping, be
lieved to be a "pi'actical joke gone
wrong," the Administration prom
ised drastic action when those re
sponsible are found. It was still
uncertain last night whether or not
any students were involved.
