# Five Flamboyant Peacocks Feature of Farm Herbarium
## 
### HELEN GROVER 
Aii especially attractive feature of
I the Stanford nursery, which is not
for embryonic roughs, are the pea
cocks, which roam freely over the
grounds.
The -nursery, or herbarium, pro
vides flowers, trees, and shrubs of
all sorts for decorative purposes on
j the campus, and is found behind the
j Anatomy Building among the trees
| where few of the students wander,
| even by chance or by moonlight.
The peacocks, five in all—three
males and two females—were for
! merly in the oval, but their shrieking
was disastrous to the studies of hard
working Phi Betes, and they were
| promptly removed. The birds are to
live at Stanford until their death,
! and all of them except one hen have
I been here as long as Stanford, as far
j as anyone knows.
The tails of the peacocks are espe
! cially brilliant at this time —mating
season. In August, the birds will
i lose their feathers, but by winter
i they will have a good start on an-
I other tail. The feathers last approxi
| mately u year.

j As yet the new tnree-yeur-oia
hen, the only addition to the group,
has laid no eggs. A peacock can lay
eggs only after (he third year, and
then only one egg. As the bird gets
older the number of eggs increase—
two or three in the fourth years and
even more later on. The birds usu
ally reach the ripe old age of 100 or
more. However, even though there
1 were eggs, the little peacocks would
never live to strut proudly beside
their parents, but would die of the
cold. But the eggs are usually eaten
by skunks or possums before they
| can hatch.
Besides the peacocks, the govern
ment has placed pheasants on the
grounds, but they have not been
seen as much this year. There are
also squirrels and cats about, and in
| a small fenced-off field is the horse
which is injected with toxins and
from which serum is obtained.
The unique animals, various flow
ers, and many kinds of shrubs make
the herbarium attractive in the day
time, and would prove even more ef
fective in the moonlight than the
i cactus gardens.
