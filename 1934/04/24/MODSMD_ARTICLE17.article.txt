# Oldfather To Talk Tonight
## "Levels of Culture" Listed As Lecture Topic 
### 
Well known for his wit and humor,
Dr. William A. Oldfather, professor
! of Classics in the University of Il
linois, will speak tonight at 7:30
o'clock in the Little Theatre on
! "'Levels of Culture: a comparison of
1 the mind and taste of the common
i man in antiquity with those of the
common man of today."
His lecture is based on some half
: million inscriptions and papyri doc
• uments, covering, a period of about
| 1.000 years. As the result of this
i abundance of information, Dr. Old
father believes it is possible to as
. sess the mind and taste of the com
mon man better for this era than for
any other before or since.
Praises Ancient Culture
In summarizing his opinions, Dr.
Oldfather seemed to cul
ture of ancient times equal to, if not
• better than our own. Literary cul
ture was more widely diffused than
|is commonly supposed, he stated.
There was less reading, but more
memorizing of the best that had been
' written. Illiteracy wafl rare, except
;in Egypt. Business records were
briefer, more varied than our own.
Private letters were short and to the
point.
Boukwriting was on a higher scale
artistically. Wall scribblings showed
better taste and mind content. Epi
taphs were never silly. True folk '
books, like the "Seven Wise Men" j
and "A%sop's Fables," are infinitely !
above our "Mother Goose."
Written by Commoners
The "Mew Testament" was written
mainly by the very commonest men,
and (except for two books) entirely
for the vei'y commonest men. "It is
I absurd," he says, "to regard its au
thors or audience as lacking in any
elements of intelligence or good
taste. Ancient classical culture was
not a thin veneer. Its great men
were only the common people, arti
culate and at their best."
Born in Urmiah, Persia, Dr. Old
father took his A.B. at Hanover Col
lege in 1899( his A.M. in Harvard in
1901, and his Ph.D. in Munich, 1908.
He has been head of the department
of Classics at the University of Illi
nois since 1926. and previous to that !
time held the position of professor ;
and assistant professor there. He is j
the author of several books, includ- j
ing "Lokrika," "The Defeat of Va- j
rus," "Index Verborum to Seneca's I
Tragedies," and "Bibliology to Spic- J
tetus."
Dr. Oldfather was appointed Sa- |
ther professor of Classical Literature j
for the current semester at the Uni- I
versity of California, where he has j
been giving a series of lectures on
"The Decline of Culture within the j
Roman Empire."

Dr. Oldfather was appointed Sa- |
ther professor of Classical Literature j
for the current semester at the Uni- I
versity of California, where he has j
been giving a series of lectures on
"The Decline of Culture within the j
Roman Empire."
Well known for his wit and humor,
Dr. William A. Oldfather, professor
! of Classics in the University of Il
linois, will speak tonight at 7:30
o'clock in the Little Theatre on
! "'Levels of Culture: a comparison of
1 the mind and taste of the common
i man in antiquity with those of the
common man of today."
His lecture is based on some half
: million inscriptions and papyri doc
• uments, covering, a period of about
| 1.000 years. As the result of this
i abundance of information, Dr. Old
father believes it is possible to as
. sess the mind and taste of the com
mon man better for this era than for
any other before or since.
Praises Ancient Culture
In summarizing his opinions, Dr.
Oldfather seemed to cul
ture of ancient times equal to, if not
• better than our own. Literary cul
ture was more widely diffused than
|is commonly supposed, he stated.
There was less reading, but more
memorizing of the best that had been
' written. Illiteracy wafl rare, except
;in Egypt. Business records were
briefer, more varied than our own.
Private letters were short and to the
point.
Boukwriting was on a higher scale
artistically. Wall scribblings showed
better taste and mind content. Epi
taphs were never silly. True folk '
books, like the "Seven Wise Men" j
and "A%sop's Fables," are infinitely !
above our "Mother Goose."
Written by Commoners
The "Mew Testament" was written
mainly by the very commonest men,
and (except for two books) entirely
for the vei'y commonest men. "It is
I absurd," he says, "to regard its au
thors or audience as lacking in any
elements of intelligence or good
taste. Ancient classical culture was
not a thin veneer. Its great men
were only the common people, arti
culate and at their best."
Born in Urmiah, Persia, Dr. Old
father took his A.B. at Hanover Col
lege in 1899( his A.M. in Harvard in
1901, and his Ph.D. in Munich, 1908.
He has been head of the department
of Classics at the University of Illi
nois since 1926. and previous to that !
time held the position of professor ;
and assistant professor there. He is j
the author of several books, includ- j
ing "Lokrika," "The Defeat of Va- j
rus," "Index Verborum to Seneca's I
Tragedies," and "Bibliology to Spic- J
tetus."
