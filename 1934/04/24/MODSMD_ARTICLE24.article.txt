raised hopes of filling Lagunita in
the minds of some, but there were
definitely false hopes, said James
W. McDonnell, assistant superin
tendent of buildings and grounds.
At 5 o'clock last night two-tenths
of an inch was recorded in the
Corporation Yard gauge for the
entire flurry. Rainfall after April
1 is unusual in these parts, as
sured McDonnell.
Nothing short of a cloudburst
can revive Lagunita for canoeists
this year. Remaining water is
being drained rapidly to irrigate
the government experimental or
chard.
