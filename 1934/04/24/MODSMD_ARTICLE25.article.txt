# Women Face Sorority Vote
## Debate To Be Held Between Ray and Hillebrand 
### 
Whether or not the Stanford wo
men approve of the sorority system
is a question which is expected to
come-to a vote in the very near fu
ture. The questions at issue will
probably be whether the women ap
prove of sororities ,as they are,
whether they suggest improvements
in the rushing system, or whether
they are in favor of abolition.
Since the non-sorority women far
outnumber the sorority women on
the campus, it is expected that same
method of equalizing the vote will
be used.
In order to provide an opportunity
for general campus discussion of the
question at issue, there will be a de
bate held sometime next week on the
disadvantages and advantages of
sororities. Helen Ray will speak for
sororities, and Jane Hillebrand
against them.
Helen Ray, interviewed last night,
said that she hoped that the debate
and open forum discussion next
week would provide an opportunity
for everyone to express opinions 011
the subject before the vote.
