"Hebrew is a most absorbing
study," commented Dr. Ernest Wit
ney Martin, professor in the De
partment of Classical Literature,
upon receiving yesterday a recent
important work entitled "A Hand
book to Old Testament Hebrew." by
Samuel G. Green. He has recently
engaged in research along that line
9and on the subject of religious lit
erature in general.
The professor is making a hobby
of the study of Hebrew as well as
research into the field of religious
literature. After a sessions of 20
hours over the week-end reading
Paul's "Epistles to the Romans," Dr.
Martin has strengthened his conclu
sion that the Disciple Paul was a
great thinker deserving of ranking
among the great philosophers of the
world.
