# I.C.-4A. Entry Lists on Way to Track Officials
## Final Decision of Board On May 3 Will Determine Fate of Trip East Meet To Be Held May 25-26 On Philadelphia Field 
### 
Names of 18 Stanford track and
Hold athletes are being sent to I.C.
4-A officials, it was learned unoffi
cially last night, in the event that
the Board of Athletic Control, which
has previously announced that it
will not send a track te'am East, re
verses its decision at its meeting
May 3. ,
Entry lists for the meet, which
will be held May 25 and 26 on Frank
lin Field in Philadelphia, will not be
accepted after May 4, it was learned,
and the names of the Stanford men
are being sent in so that should the
B.A.C. decide to finance the trip the
Cards would be eligible to enter.
Twelve May Go
If the B.A.C. consents to send a
team to Philadelphia, two-thirds and
possibly fewer of the 18 men named
on the entry lists will be given the
opportunity, It was thought. The
progress and performances of the
various athletes belweeij now and
the time of the meet will probably
be the deciding factor as qualifica
tion for making the trip.
Having already agreed to send a
team to the N.C.2-A meet in South
ern California May 5, the B.A.C.
previously announced that it Would
not be able also to finance an East
ern trip. Student activities spon
sored- by Skull and Snakes have
raised enough money to send but two
men to the meet.
