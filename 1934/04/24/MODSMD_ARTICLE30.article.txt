Tonight's Kx Committee meeting will furnish the first
opportunity for opponents of the recently defeated con
stitution to tell the new revision committee just what they
think is wrong with the document as it stands.
A second opportunity will he afforded them Thursday
evening at the Forum meeting.
I>elween these two sessions (poor attendances in the
past have forced the administration to cancel assemblies)
there should he sufficient airing of troublesome situations
end the constitution brought down to some sort of common
ground. ยง
Should it be that the very crux of the document
centralized control in the Kx Committee is strongly op
posed and a subsequent rewriting is necessary, probably
il will result in the delay of the new instrument's enact
ment until next fall.
If such is the case, there should be no hard feelings,
for il is better to make a complete correction than a par
tial one. The new revision committee has asked that all
objections be brought out of the closet and aired publicly.
The only way in which mistakes can be corrected is bv the
suggestions of those who can see and understand the mis
fakes.
Times and places for open discussion, convenient to all,
have been announced. Complaints should be registered
\()\Y not after revisions are made.
