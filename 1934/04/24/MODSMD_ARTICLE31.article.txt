Theatrically minded individuals will lie certain to at
tend tonight's meeting of the Ex Committee al o'clock
in the Old t'nion, when the question of a theatre for Stan
ford e.rises. Ohviouslv, Stanford today has no showhousc
worthy of mention as such, and a heads-lip Ex Committee
has a chance to take immediate action in providing a rem
edy for the unfortunate situation.
At last week's session, following a preliminary report
from the IiKW Theatre Fund Committee, Acting Chairman
John Lyman asked members of the body to consider the
problem before tonight's meeting in order lo be prepared
lo present constructive ideas.
Tonight, tiie principal point of consideration lies in
the financing of the proposed structure. The Daily has ad
vocated co-operation of the student body with the Admin
istration, whereby the A.S.S.I . might bear its share of the
cost. Stanford students of today demand a theatre. There
tore they should be willing to help bring if back to the
campus. It remains for Ex Committee lo form a definite
plan.
Very little time remains if anything at all is lo be ac
complished before the summer vacation.
Those who have ideas on the subject will do well lo
be in the ()ld I'nion tonight.
