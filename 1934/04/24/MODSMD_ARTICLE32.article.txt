# WHY IT'S NEWS
## The 						Guiding Hand Is Slipping 
### CROMPTON BANGS Jr 
During the past year, President ]
Roosevelt has supplied nearly all the ]
leadership in and out of Congress, j
As time passed, what DemocJatic
leaders there were in the House and
Senate rapidly lost their grip.
Now under our system of govern- j
ment it is absolutely necessary that j
there be real party leaders in both
Congress and the White House. ]
When leadership is lacking in either
place, legislative programs are sure
to go on the rocks.
F.R. feels that much of the grow
ing insurgency of this session of [
Congress could have been avoided ;
had different men been in charge of
things. So far, the House has kicked
over the traces on the bonus, the !
veterans' veto, the tax bill, and the j
silver inflation bill. It is likely to
repeat on the stock market bill.
These things have thrown large
sized monkey - wrenches into the 1
Roosevelt, program—perhaps for the
rest of the year. What will be done
about all this?
Needed: A Change
Most Washington observers think
Speaker Rainey and Floor Leader
Eyrns might have done better on j
several occasions. They are accifsed
of being asleep at the switch while
the House leadership slipped through
their fingers into the hands of the
various lobbies, 1

Lately behind-the-scenes moves
in the House have pretty thoroughly
ditched anti-F.R. bills. The authors
of the parliamentary hocus-pocus
needed to do the trick were not the
present Speaker and Floor Leader.
Instead, after taking off the lid, we
find Representative Bankhead and
Ray burn.
When Garner was Speaker, he
kept most of his Democrats well in
hand. Texas' Sam Rayburn was one
of his right-hand men as well as a
fellow poker player. Alabama's
Bankhead (Tallulah's uncle) has an
uncanny way of knowing just what
the farmers the thinking. Between
them, they should furnish leader
hip where it is badly needed.
How It's Done
So don't be surprised if Rainey
and Byrns are "kicked upstairs"
during the summer. They may be
promoted to the Tariff Commission
as a reward for faithful service. Such
are the ways of our government.
But it is very necessary to have
leadership in the House at all times.
Next year, it will be even more nec
essary. For as prosperity returns,
and business feels more confident of
its strength, F.R.'s leadership is
likely to decline—unless he has a
real hold on Congress. This is the
why and the wherefore of the pro
posed change of House leaders,

veterans' veto, the tax bill, and the j
silver inflation bill. It is likely to
repeat on the stock market bill.
These things have thrown large
sized monkey - wrenches into the 1
Roosevelt, program—perhaps for the
rest of the year. What will be done
about all this?
Needed: A Change
Most Washington observers think
Speaker Rainey and Floor Leader
Eyrns might have done better on j
several occasions. They are accifsed
of being asleep at the switch while
the House leadership slipped through
their fingers into the hands of the
various lobbies, 1

Lately behind-the-scenes moves
in the House have pretty thoroughly
ditched anti-F.R. bills. The authors
of the parliamentary hocus-pocus
needed to do the trick were not the
present Speaker and Floor Leader.
Instead, after taking off the lid, we
find Representative Bankhead and
Ray burn.
When Garner was Speaker, he
kept most of his Democrats well in
hand. Texas' Sam Rayburn was one
of his right-hand men as well as a
fellow poker player. Alabama's
Bankhead (Tallulah's uncle) has an
uncanny way of knowing just what
the farmers the thinking. Between
them, they should furnish leader
hip where it is badly needed.
How It's Done
So don't be surprised if Rainey
and Byrns are "kicked upstairs"
during the summer. They may be
promoted to the Tariff Commission
as a reward for faithful service. Such
are the ways of our government.
But it is very necessary to have
leadership in the House at all times.
Next year, it will be even more nec
essary. For as prosperity returns,
and business feels more confident of
its strength, F.R.'s leadership is
likely to decline—unless he has a
real hold on Congress. This is the
why and the wherefore of the pro
posed change of House leaders,
During the past year, President ]
Roosevelt has supplied nearly all the ]
leadership in and out of Congress, j
As time passed, what DemocJatic
leaders there were in the House and
Senate rapidly lost their grip.
Now under our system of govern- j
ment it is absolutely necessary that j
there be real party leaders in both
Congress and the White House. ]
When leadership is lacking in either
place, legislative programs are sure
to go on the rocks.
F.R. feels that much of the grow
ing insurgency of this session of [
Congress could have been avoided ;
had different men been in charge of
things. So far, the House has kicked
over the traces on the bonus, the !
veterans' veto, the tax bill, and the j
silver inflation bill. It is likely to
repeat on the stock market bill.
