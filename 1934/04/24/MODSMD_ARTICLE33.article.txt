LE BOURGEOIS GENTILHOMME
(Moliere)
At the War Memorial Opera House
Thanks to the courage and initia
tive of M. Andre Ferrier, San Fran
ciscans were able to see this remark
able production of Moliere which in
completeness and competence must
unfortunately rank as almost uni
que—if not entirely so—in this coun
try.
With the able assistance of an ex
cellent company which included
some exquisite ballets under the di
rection of Adolph Bolm and a salon
orchestra guided by Gatsone Usigli,
as well as the actors in the play
proper, Ferrier presented a picto
rially beautiful and dramatically fine
production.
Delicacy and grace went hand in
hand with the amusing exaggera
tions of farce here. The Jourdain of
Ferrier, Yvonne du Parc's Nicole,
and the playing of Georges Simone
det in two roles may be mentioned as
outstanding.
Thi? comedy is of the simplest sort,
depending upon pantomine to sus
tain and enlarge the comedy of the
lines. As satire the play is as perti
nent as it ever was; the arrogance of
the nouv<jau riche has been the sub
ject for writers through the cen
turies. In comparing this play with
so transiently popular a farce as
Maugham's "Jack Straw" the uni-
Maugham's tendency toward semi
versality of Moliere is manifest,
solemn adjuration mars the later
play.
The manifest success of this pro
duction will, it is to be hoped, lead
to more productions of a similar sort.
San Francisco has proven itself suf
ficiently cosmopolitan by its happily
warm reception of "Le Bourgeois
Gentilhomme" to warrant further
experimentation in the same me
dium. —Sandoe

William Pabst is to be congratu
lated for his direction of one of the
smoothest, most finished productions
to be seen at the Community Thea
tre. The play was considerably
amusing, but the awkward introduc
tion of plot after a beautiful be
ginning lowered the entertainment
value, as did the pointing of the
thesis that the worship of art as a
deity is not justified.
Harry Wheeler Morse was the
father, whose constant changes of
attitude provided much of the eve
ning's mirth. Not a comedian, Morse
seemed uncertain about his part and
regularly anticipated his laughs.
Lucie Bentley, Mrs. Bottle, handled
her scenes well, though her stiff
gestures and a sadly written part
tended to make the character weak.
The minor parts were more con
sistently good. To Peggy Dresel,
playing a very obvious comic model,
and to the two junior Bottles, An
thony Morse and Constance Clark,
go the laurels of the evening.

tain and enlarge the comedy of the
lines. As satire the play is as perti
nent as it ever was; the arrogance of
the nouv<jau riche has been the sub
ject for writers through the cen
turies. In comparing this play with
so transiently popular a farce as
Maugham's "Jack Straw" the uni-
Maugham's tendency toward semi
versality of Moliere is manifest,
solemn adjuration mars the later
play.
The manifest success of this pro
duction will, it is to be hoped, lead
to more productions of a similar sort.

At the Palo Alto Community Theatre
William Pabst is to be congratu
lated for his direction of one of the
smoothest, most finished productions
to be seen at the Community Thea
tre. The play was considerably
amusing, but the awkward introduc
tion of plot after a beautiful be
ginning lowered the entertainment
value, as did the pointing of the
thesis that the worship of art as a
deity is not justified.
Harry Wheeler Morse was the
father, whose constant changes of
attitude provided much of the eve
ning's mirth. Not a comedian, Morse
seemed uncertain about his part and
regularly anticipated his laughs.
Lucie Bentley, Mrs. Bottle, handled
her scenes well, though her stiff
gestures and a sadly written part
tended to make the character weak.
The minor parts were more con
sistently good. To Peggy Dresel,
playing a very obvious comic model,
and to the two junior Bottles, An
thony Morse and Constance Clark,
go the laurels of the evening.

LE BOURGEOIS GENTILHOMME
(Moliere)
At the War Memorial Opera House
Thanks to the courage and initia
tive of M. Andre Ferrier, San Fran
ciscans were able to see this remark
able production of Moliere which in
completeness and competence must
unfortunately rank as almost uni
que—if not entirely so—in this coun
try.
With the able assistance of an ex
cellent company which included
some exquisite ballets under the di
rection of Adolph Bolm and a salon
orchestra guided by Gatsone Usigli,
as well as the actors in the play
proper, Ferrier presented a picto
rially beautiful and dramatically fine
production.
Delicacy and grace went hand in
hand with the amusing exaggera
tions of farce here. The Jourdain of
Ferrier, Yvonne du Parc's Nicole,
and the playing of Georges Simone
det in two roles may be mentioned as
outstanding.
Thi? comedy is of the simplest sort,
depending upon pantomine to sus
tain and enlarge the comedy of the
lines. As satire the play is as perti
nent as it ever was; the arrogance of
the nouv<jau riche has been the sub
ject for writers through the cen
turies. In comparing this play with
so transiently popular a farce as
