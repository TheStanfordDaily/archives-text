# SLAYS NEGRO IN COURT
## 
### 
CROCKETT, Tex., April 23 (/P). —
Bon Ellis today shot to death in a
crowded courtroom a Negro accused
of slaying his uncle.

The Colorado School of Mines has
a ruling prohibiting sophomores
from paddling freshmen. The sophs
get around it by making the frosh
paddle each other. •
