# BULL SESSION
## THE 						STANFORD HOME FOR GIRLS 
### 
Freshmen are always somewhat
startled at jumping cataclysmically
from the "boys and girls" classifica
tion of high school days, to the very
high-sounding "ladies and gentle
men" caste of the university. There
seems no good reason for it; it is
unexplainably inexplicable. To the
freshwomen at least, the mystery
becomes still more mystifying when
they are presented with a copy of
the A.W.S. "Social Regulations."
If the title "ladies and gentlemen"
means anything, it indicates that
apron strings have been severed. It
means that the little beastie which
was once mother's little "boy or
girl" has flown the coop, and is now
ready to assume the responsibilities
u«d pleasures of adulthood. But the
code of the "Stanford Home for
Girls," the "Code of the Cult of the
Clean" denies this interpretation.
The high school lass who was once
free to call on her neighborhood
Johnny, is now denied this pleasure;
the "Regulations" are against it. But
the rule can be circumvented by
bringing along a pesky friend, or a
snoopy chaperone; the "Regulations"
say so.
Such is the new freedom; such is
the advantage of being called a
"woman" instead of a "girl." We be
lieve that the University can take
but two logical attitudes in regard to
its "800" little pets.
Logical attitude No. 1.: The "wom
en" are actually just "girls"; they
must be mothered, and for. In
which case, Dean Mary must become
a glorified foster mother. She must
feel a moral responsibility for the
infinite care of sore thumbs, aching

1 stomachs, and hurt feelings. She j
must see that the girls are culturally, !
socially, and morally sound. In which j
case, it seems also logical that Dean i
Culver should do no less for his
"boys." It is just as important to
keep Stanford men out of San Fran
' ciseo's Sinks of Sin as it is for the (
Administration to coddle and pet
Stanford women. A physically and
morally sound male is about equally
important or unimportant to the i
welfare of the race.
Logical attitude No. 2: Stanford
"women" are "women," and not some !
queer half-way mixture of the things i
, which run around Castilleja and j
Paly High. In which case extra- ;
| curricular visits are to be encour
aged and not suppressed.
If the Stanford Indian is to be- i
j come the squaw's maid, it is high
| time the Convalescent Home were
moved to the Quad.

Freshmen are always somewhat
startled at jumping cataclysmically
from the "boys and girls" classifica
tion of high school days, to the very
high-sounding "ladies and gentle
men" caste of the university. There
seems no good reason for it; it is
unexplainably inexplicable. To the
freshwomen at least, the mystery
becomes still more mystifying when
they are presented with a copy of
the A.W.S. "Social Regulations."
If the title "ladies and gentlemen"
means anything, it indicates that
apron strings have been severed. It
means that the little beastie which
was once mother's little "boy or
girl" has flown the coop, and is now
ready to assume the responsibilities
u«d pleasures of adulthood. But the
code of the "Stanford Home for
Girls," the "Code of the Cult of the
Clean" denies this interpretation.
The high school lass who was once
free to call on her neighborhood
Johnny, is now denied this pleasure;
the "Regulations" are against it. But
the rule can be circumvented by
bringing along a pesky friend, or a
snoopy chaperone; the "Regulations"
say so.
Such is the new freedom; such is
the advantage of being called a
"woman" instead of a "girl." We be
lieve that the University can take
but two logical attitudes in regard to
its "800" little pets.
Logical attitude No. 1.: The "wom
en" are actually just "girls"; they
must be mothered, and for. In
which case, Dean Mary must become
a glorified foster mother. She must
feel a moral responsibility for the
infinite care of sore thumbs, aching

1 stomachs, and hurt feelings. She j
must see that the girls are culturally, !
socially, and morally sound. In which j
case, it seems also logical that Dean i
Culver should do no less for his
"boys." It is just as important to
keep Stanford men out of San Fran
' ciseo's Sinks of Sin as it is for the (
Administration to coddle and pet
Stanford women. A physically and
morally sound male is about equally
important or unimportant to the i
welfare of the race.
Logical attitude No. 2: Stanford
"women" are "women," and not some !
queer half-way mixture of the things i
, which run around Castilleja and j
Paly High. In which case extra- ;
| curricular visits are to be encour
aged and not suppressed.
If the Stanford Indian is to be- i
