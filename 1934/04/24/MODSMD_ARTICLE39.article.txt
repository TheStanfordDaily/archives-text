BASEBALL
Two teams, to be chosen tomor
row, will vie from now on in using
(hat 10-inch ball to the mast advan
tage on the women's diamond, using
the official rules for batting order.
In the list of baseball players there
i.s Kathleen Cottrell, who has, in
short, "baseball sense." Other heavy
hitlers are Phyllis Boothe and Vir
ginia Swtjfford.
As potential pitchers Helen Wat
ters and Marcia McFarland make the
batters sit up and pay attention, and
Joan Macgowan is adept at swinging
a baseball as well as a golf ball.
TENNIS
A star at the top of the tennis lad
der is Elizabeth Kestings, who is
number four in the National Junior
Women's ranking for singles, and
first in doubles with Helen Fulton,
who attended Stanford last year.
Kestings' experience in doubles
probably accounts for her beautiful
net play.
Having no one to challenge, the
present matches hold less interest
lor Kestings than the all-star tour
nament which will be played after
the middle of next month with the
final play for the cup coming on
Field Day.
Being from St. Paul, Minnesota,
she has the problem of getting used
to the asphalt courts.
Certain to be among the all-stars
is Margaret Diedrich, second on the
ladder, who possesses nine cups and
number five rating in the state.
Then there is Betty Pearce of To
kyo who plays at the California Ten
nis Club, Alice Philp, Carrie Richter,
and Dot.Ann Jackson, of California,
who also shine in the galaxy of the
first six.
GOLF
More prizes have been offered for
the winners and runners-up in each
flight in the women's golf tourna
ment which starts next week. Qual
ifying rounds are being played this
week with 30 signed up, and anyone
may yet qualify by turning in her
score by Monday noon. The list of
flights will be posted Monday after
noon.
A dozen golf balls apiece have
been offered by Dr. Dyment and
Lloyd Allen of the Palo Alto Hard
ware Company for the two low
scorers in each flight, and the run
ner-up in the tournament receives a
golf club from Smith's on the Circle.
There is also a consolation prize.
There is a lot of interest and a lot of
inducement.
MORE HONORS
Held in esteem pre Mrs. Margaret
Barr and Miss Grace King, Stanford
instructors in athletics, who were
elected a« member of the Basket
ball Examining Committee and
treasurer, respectively, of the San
Francisco Bay Counties Board of
Women Officials at its annual spring
meeting Thursday at Berkeley.
