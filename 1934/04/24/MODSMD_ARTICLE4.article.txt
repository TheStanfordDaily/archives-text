# Admission To Carnival Low
## 
### 
Fun galore will be in store for
those who choose to go to the Sopho
more Carnival next Friday night,
April 27. Startling as it may seem,
admission to this gala affair is but a
dime per person.
Chairman Bill Drew reports that
A1 Rushton's orchestra, with no less
than 12 pieces, will be available to
dancers all evening for a paltry five
cents a dance. It is rumored that
Carl Ravazza, of the Palace Hotel",
is being sought for specialty num
bers between the dances.
Dee Myers, in charge of the aqua
tic events, reports that the first and
second-string water polo teams will
tangle in a game for the benefit of
spectators, while some diving de luxe
will be exhibited by varsity men
Milt Friedman, Tommy Boothe, and
George Fuller.
Funster Winstead Weaver, famed
in Gaieties and other places, will be
master of ceremonies. Skits will be
presented by fraternity houses, one
of which mimics the famous Mills
Brothers.
Johnny Miles, chairman of the
booths, reports that the various
houses are sponsoring booths which
are sure to be popularâ€”caricatures,
by Sigma Chi; penny-throwing by
Kappa Sigs, baseball throw by El
Toro, and bowling by Phi Kaps are
some of the stellar attractions. A
"rat race" by Theta Delta Chi was
hinted, but when pressed for de
tails Chairman Miles looked myste
rious and declined to commit him
self.
