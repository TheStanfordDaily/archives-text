# Indian Ball Team Plays Final St. Mary's Series
## NINE FAVORED TO WIN BOTH GAMES ON MORAGA FIELD 
### 
This afternoon on the Moragj
! Valley diamond, weather providing
| Coach Harry Wolter's 1934 Care
I varsity will begin cleaning up th<
| last series of the current seasor
when they meet the St. Mary's var
! sity nine. The final game will b(
1 played Saturday, also with the Gaels
From the standpoint of both team;
! the game will be little more thai
j a formality and an opportunity tc
J give experience to players of 193f
| varsity caliber. California, by vir
! tue of only one loss, and that to thf:
] Trojans, long ago sent the California
1 Interscholastic Baseball Associatior
| championship pennant up the Ed
wards Field flag pole.
Meanwhile the Trojans trimmed
I the Gaels three straight during St
i Mary's barnstorming trip in the
| South last week, thereby securely
ensconcing U.S.C. in the second po
j sition.
St. Mary's Poor
I St. Mary's should prove little op
i position, having lost 13 and won one
j league game.
Probable starter in the pitchers'
j box for the Cards will be Johnny
I Campbell, the J.C. transfer who has
! been hurling some fair ball during
j the past few weeks. Campbell's last
| appearance on the mound for the
I Indians was a week ago in the start
i ing lineup of the fourth U.C. game,
| For three innings no Bear reached
j first base, but then Johnny got into
I a bit of trouble, with three runs
scoring before the inning was over,
and a relief hurler was sent in.
Campbell should have little trouble
with the Moraga batters should he
open tomorrow.
Batting Improves
During the past Cal games the
Stanford batters seem to have taken
a turn for the better. Notably Cap
tain Dick Miles broke off his slump
which hurt his batting average dur
ing the middle of the season by hit
ting three for five last Saturday. In
the Tuesday game Bob Hamilton, left
fielder, led both teams with four hits
in five trips.
Galbraith Brilliant
The other slugger has been Eddie
Galbraith, fiery little second base
man, who got a chance at the key
stone sack following the Southern
trip and has been the life of the
infield ever since. At Berkeley last
Tuesday Galbraith made the Cali
fornia fans recall his great perform
ances during the little big series last
year by clubbing out a triple. Sat
urday the soph slugger batted .600
and drove in four of Stanford's seven
runs. Galbraith, Miles, and Hamil
ton should have a big day at the
plate today.

From the standpoint of both team;
! the game will be little more thai
j a formality and an opportunity tc
J give experience to players of 193f

| championship pennant up the Ed

Meanwhile the Trojans trimmed
I the Gaels three straight during St
i Mary's barnstorming trip in the
| South last week, thereby securely
ensconcing U.S.C. in the second po
j sition.
St. Mary's Poor
I St. Mary's should prove little op
i position, having lost 13 and won one
j league game.
Probable starter in the pitchers'
j box for the Cards will be Johnny
I Campbell, the J.C. transfer who has
! been hurling some fair ball during
j the past few weeks. Campbell's last
| appearance on the mound for the
I Indians was a week ago in the start
i ing lineup of the fourth U.C. game,
| For three innings no Bear reached
j first base, but then Johnny got into
I a bit of trouble, with three runs
scoring before the inning was over,
and a relief hurler was sent in.
Campbell should have little trouble
with the Moraga batters should he
open tomorrow.
Batting Improves
During the past Cal games the
Stanford batters seem to have taken
a turn for the better. Notably Cap
tain Dick Miles broke off his slump
which hurt his batting average dur
ing the middle of the season by hit
ting three for five last Saturday. In
the Tuesday game Bob Hamilton, left
fielder, led both teams with four hits
in five trips.
Galbraith Brilliant
The other slugger has been Eddie
Galbraith, fiery little second base
man, who got a chance at the key
stone sack following the Southern
trip and has been the life of the
infield ever since. At Berkeley last
Tuesday Galbraith made the Cali
fornia fans recall his great perform
ances during the little big series last
year by clubbing out a triple. Sat
urday the soph slugger batted .600
and drove in four of Stanford's seven
runs. Galbraith, Miles, and Hamil
ton should have a big day at the
plate today.
