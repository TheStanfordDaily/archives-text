# SPRING FOOTBALL PRACTICE BEGINS
## 
### 
Bobby Grayson and Monk Mos
, crip, all-Coast full and end, respec-
I tively, came out for a bit of spring
| practice yesterday and were greeted
with a shower of rain. The twain
had been out for baseball previously,
but as there is only one remaining
unimportant week, they switched to
the grid. Bones Hamilton, another
baseballer, will come out next week.
Other new arrivals were freshman
track and baseball men, out for
places on the varsity. Chuck Led
better, one of the two consistent
frosh groundgainers last year, and
recently a shot-putter, was out oil
ing up the old kinks and charging
with the other fullbacks.
Guards and centers went through
a rigorous charging drill aimed at
the stationai'y and movable dum
mies, under the eyes of Headman
Thornhill and Husky Hunt, learning
some new lineup formations and in
terference running.
Ray Lewis was completing suc
cessfully most of his dropkicks from
the 20-yard line, while some of the
backs went down to the far end ol
the field and rifled passes into the
canvas "screen." Backfield men ran
through some plays, and were later
joined by line players.
