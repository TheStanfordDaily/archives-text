### 
After spending one tveek-end
watching other Card athletes in ac
tion, the polo squad got down to
serious work yesterday in prepara
tion for their two games with Oregon
State College here on Thursday and
I Saturday afternoons.
Stanford's first-string riders of
: Luppen, Rogers, Fullerton, and Ras- ,
; mussen will not see action in these
> games, have plenty in store for them
! later in the season. They are leaving
this week's assignment to Bill Ene
mark, Cal Emeis, Frank Burns, and
Jim Henderson.
Following this series, the first- j
string will again go into action j
against Will Tevis' San Mateo riders
on May 4, in the playoff game of a ;
series started 10 days ago. The game '
will be played at the highway field
on the campus.
Barnard College students have
begun indoor practice for the Greek
games next spring. Hoop l'olling,
hurdling, and discus throwing in the
Greek form are the chief events.
