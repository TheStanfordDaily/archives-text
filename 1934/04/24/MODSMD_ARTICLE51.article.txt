Marty, who holds the outdoor rec-
I ord of 6 feet 8% inches, and the in
door mark one-eighth inch higher,
will attempt to set a new outdoor
mark on Saturday. Spectators who
attended Skull and Snakes All-Uni
versity meet of March 10 will never
forget the great exhibition there put
on by Marty when the Fresno star
cleared 6 feet 8 inches in his first
outdoor perfoiTnance of the season.
Has Cleared 6 Feet SVi Inches
Since that time Marty has leaped
G feet 9Vi inches unofficially, and
provisions will be made to have the
required trio of A.A.U. officials pres
ent on Saturday so that any new
records made may receive official
sanction.
A great duel looms in the half-mile
in Saturday's meet. Elroy Robinson,
fine Fresno State half-miler, who
galloped the 880 yards in 1:54.7 to
defeat the best that the Trojans
could offer in the Fresno State-
U.S.C. meet earlier this season, will
compete against Stanford's "Chuck"
Nimmo.
i Tremendously encouraged by his
j athletes' great exhibition against
[ California's track stars last Saturday,
i Coach Dink Templeton will spend
i the remainder of this week getting
I the Cards in shape for a Fresno
| State team which invades Angell
■ Field Saturday and also for a more
! important objective, the Stanford
i U.S.C. meet at Los Angeles on May 5.
| The Cardinals came out of the Big
{ Meet unscathed. Bud Deacon, prem-
I ier pole vaClter, was believed to have
i slightly wrenched his back in at
| tempting to compete in his specialty
j and the javelin throw, but an exami
: nation falied to uncover any serious
| injury.
j Captain Gus Meier is almost en
' tirely recovered from his bothersome
1 cold which confined him to the hos
pital for several days last week.
