# NETMEN WIN 2 OF 6 MATCHES DURING SEASON
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity tennis season
came to a close last Saturday with
the California matches. Had the
Cardinals won their record would
not have been bad, but their defeat,
six matches to three at the hands of
the Bear netmen, resulted in a sea
son average of six matches played
with two won and four iost.
First match of the season, the In
dian netmen traveled to Berkeley.
They made a good showing, would
possibly have won by a score of
seven matches to two, had they not
substituted when the match was
cinched. As a result, the final score
1 was 5-4.
Team Travels South
During (he spring vacation the
team traveled south, mostly by au
tomobile, saving money so that the
tennis ball budget would last
throughout the season. After two
practice matches, during which the
Los Angeles Tennis Club was taken
i down, the Stanford six encountered
their second hurdle against U.C.L.A.
Here they played lethargically, and
were beaten by the Bruins. On the
; very next day, against the strong
j U.S.C. team, again the Cardinal team
: lost. Mako subdued Sam Lee, play
i ing first man for Stanford, and al
though Captain Otis v/on his
matches, Stanford was two down in
1 conference standings.
Cards Defeat Bruins
During the second week of spring
quarter, U.S.C. traveled to the Stan
i ford campus, and succeeded in again
trouncing the Cards. On the follow
ing week-end, the Bruins came up,
but did not fare so well and Stanford
scored its only other conference vic
tory against them, five matches to
four.
In the final match last Saturday
the Bears made up for their first de
feat, and taking advantage of the
absence of Sam Lee and Glenn Reed
from the Stanford lineup, triumphed,
six matches to three.
Throughout the season "Chuck"'
Otis played excellent tennis; Sam
Lee never got a chance to get into
good shape, while the remainder of
the team were decidedly weak in
comparison with former Cardinal net
teams. However, things look up for
next year.
