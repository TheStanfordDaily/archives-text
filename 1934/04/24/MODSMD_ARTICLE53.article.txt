# Blizzard Halts Posse Tracing Dillinger Trail
## Desperado Battles Through U.S. Net; Now Hiding In Northern Wisconsin 
### 
MERCER, Wis., April 23 (A*).â€”
John Dillingcr, with hate in his
heart and murder in his trigger fin
ger, was somewhere in the wilder
ness of Northern Wisconsin tonight,
a grim posse hard on his heels after
he had blazed his way out of a po
lice trap leaving three dead and
three wounded.
He had vanished out of a be
leagured Wisconsin resort last night,
with his quick shooting first lieuten
ant, John Hamilton, and live of his
outlaw band, after he had taken pos
session of the place and mounted a
machine gun to repel invaders.
Tonight this north woods section
was in the grip of a blizzard with
hard-driving now hampering the
government men and local officers in
their pursuit.
Apparently the Dillingcr gang
split after the deadly gun battle, but
officials felt sure, in spite of con
flicting reports received from vari
ous parts of the countryside, that
Dillingcr was in -this section, and
there was no letup in the search.
Hours after the escape detectives
at a St. Paul suburb traded fusilades
of rifle fire with a speeding auto
mobile carrying three men, one of
them believed to be the leader of
the gang. But again they eluded
pursuit.
