AlRLlNESâ€”Daylight saving time,
pet peeve of the western broadcaster,
goes into effect next week, and both
networks have their publicity de
partments working overtime in order
to get schedules rearranged. Yet,
while daylight saving is a source of
endless grief for the nets, listeners
are afforded little inconvenience.
Most of the programs coming from
the East will be merely set forward
an hour, but some of the early eve
ning programs are shifted to a dif
ferent time in order that they may
reach the maximum audience.
Few of the major progi'ams will
leave the air this summer, as they
have in times past. Investigation has
disclosed that most of the usual air
audience will either not take a va
cation this summer or else will take
a radio along, and consequently most
of the sponsors have decided to con
tinue their programs through thci
summer months.
