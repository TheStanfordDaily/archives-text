### 
Following the announcement by
Sword and Sandals that its next
reading will be the eighteenth cen
tury tragedy, "George Barnwell,"
several faculty members have has
tened to express their approval oÂ£
such a choice.
Dr. Merrel Clubb, asked by the
dramatic organization to direct this
leading, said of the play, "I have
never been the same since the time
I first read 'The London Merchant.'
And yet sometimes this noble trag
edy makes me wonder whether sin
can be so evil or evil so .sinful when
repentance is shown to be so win
some and forgiveness so ineflabiy
sweet. It has for years been my
hope to have a share in the revival
of this moving drama, and now at
last my hope is to be realized. Oh,
happy day!"
Surpasses King Kong
Grant Hopewell, campus critic,
said of the chief character in the
play, "George Barnwell is not as
great a tragic figure as King Kong,
but he accomplishes more." Hope
well added, "It is a masterpiece of
morality." Meanwhile Curt Ziman
sky, president of the English Club
and student of obscure languages,
retorted with the following bomb
shell, "It is a masterpiece of im
morality." A duel i* being contem
plated.
There is an authentic record pre
served in a letter from an actor, Mr.
Ross, of the redemption from shame
of a young apprentice who, having
embezzled some money, saw a per
formance of "George Barnwell" and
was moved to repentance and resti
tution by the splendid performance
given the leading role by Ross.
The Sword and Sandals reading of
this splendid tragic drama will be
presented next Thursday evening in
the Little Theatre. In order to en
courage the attendance of the young,
there will be no admission charge.
