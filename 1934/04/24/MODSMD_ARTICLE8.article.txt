# Craig Speaks Of Avon Bard
## Values of Shakespeare Are Told in Lecture 
### 
An explanation of the values and
meanings in the life and works of
William Shakespeare last night oc
cupied the center of attention on the
Stanford University Hour when Pro
fessor Hardin Craig, chairman of the
School of Letters here, spoke over
radio station KPO at 7:45 o'clock.
Dr. Craig, through the medium of
contributions to magazines and pe
riodicals, books which he has writ
ten, and 20 years' experience in
teaching and individual research, is
recognized as one of the best-versed
modern authorities on the "Bard of
Avon."
Contemporaries Admired Him
William Shakespeare's contempo
raries speak of him as fluent, gifted,
friendly, and upright, and there is
always affection in their tone, said
Dr. Craig, who went on to comment
that "our greatest poet was that sort
of a man in the opinion of those who
knew him and also in the inferences
one may draw from his works."
His genius, Dr. Craig believes, is
of the normal objective kind, and his
works were written from a point of
view of universality, meaning that
they have in them a minimum of af
fection, formalism, dogmatism, ego
tism, and prejudice. His works are
about life, people, human qualities,
and recurrent human situations, are
made of human stuff, and show hu
man needs, passions, and qualities.
Fame Came Later
Shakespeare was outshone in his
own day by many dramatists and
literary men whose works are not
nearly so important today, stated
Dr. Craig, but "Gentle Will" had
many to praise and admire him,
while many more paid him the trib
ute of imitation. After 1597 Shake
speare's name began to appear on the
quarto editions of his plays, and in
1593 Francis Meres included him in
that famous puff of all the Eliza
bethan poets and dramatists, Pal
ladis Tamia.
The topic of Dr. Craig's talk was
"Shakespeare's Birthday," and was
given in honor of the 350 th anniver
sary of the great poet's birth, avail
able records showing that Shake
speare was born April 23, 1564.
