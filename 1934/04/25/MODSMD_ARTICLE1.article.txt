# STANFORD NINE DROPS GAME TO ST. MARY'S, 3-2
## Indians Held to Five Hits As Gaels Win Second League Game HEARN, MILES SCORE Lone Tallies Made in First; Card Fielding Good 
### 
St. Mary's varsity baseball team
gained a slim 3-2 win over the Stan
ford nine yesterday afternoon on the
Gaels' diamond as Bob Semmelroth
of the Cards and Lefty Godec of
Moraga engaged in a classy pitchers'
duel.
While the 3-2 win was only the
second of the 1934 league play for
St. Mary's, yesterday's ball game
was marked by first-class play by
both nines. Stanford turned in an
unbeatable fielding game, their first
perfect nine innings in the score
book.
All the Indian runs came in the
first, with Art Hearn opening with a
single. Mort Nutting and Bob Ham
ilton were out, but Captain Dick
Miles went to first when hit by a
pitched ball. Eddie Galbraith, the
next man up, got his only hit of the
day when he singled, scoring Hearn
and Miles.
