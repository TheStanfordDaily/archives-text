# Chinese Will Answer Japs
## Minister Says China Wants Other Nations' Help 
### 
GENEVA, April 24 (/P). â€” China
1 decided to take direct issue with
Japan on Tokoy's warning that for
eign aid to China considered as en
dangering peace in East Asia will be
opposed by the Japanese.
Chit Sai Hu, the Chinese minister
to Switzerland, was delegated by his
government to reply to the Tokyo
! manifesto of April 17 and the dec
| laration here yesterday by the Japa
nese consul-general, Masayuki Yo
koyama, that Asia is"for Asiatics
under the leadership of Japan acting
in close collaboration with other
1 Asiatic powers."
He invited world press corre
! spondents to meet with him at 5
p.m., Wednesday, when, it was said,
he plans to explain "the necessity of
Chinese reconstruction and China's
desire to obtain aid from other na
tions."
League of Nations circles regarded
the Japanese pronouncements as far
from reassuring because of the pres
ent Far Eastern situation and be
cause, they said, Japan seeks .to in
: culcate in all Asiatic peoples Japa
j nese ideas and leadership.
"Japan does not object to aid from
I the League of Nations if it is well
employed," said Yokoyama, "but we
i will warn the League we do not want
it used against the policy of Japan,
which is a policy of peace."
Countries with which Japan will
collaborate in maintaining peace, he
added, are India, the Dutch Indies,
Siam, and the Philippines.
