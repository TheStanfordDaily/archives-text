"There lie beneath these cold, hard 1
stones
The mould'ring bones of Sally Jones
Her name was Lord instead of Jones
But Jones was used to rhyme with
stones."
Quoting such epitaphs as this as
examples of present-day cultural
degeneracy, Dr. William Oldfather,
professor of Classics in the Univer
sity of Illinois, last night kept his
Tuesday evening lecture audience
highly amused throughout his dis
cussion of "Levels of Culture: a com
parison of the mind and taste of the
common man of antiquity with those
of the common man of today."
Obviously favoring Greek and
Roman culture to our own, Dr. Old
father based his information on
some half million papyri documents
and inscriptions, covering a period
of a thousand years. Comparing
wills, epitaphs, business papers, j
books, he demonstrated that the lit

eracy culture of the ancients was
much more widespread than ours,
especially among the lower classes.
Take for example the personal
letter. Private correspondence of the
Greeks and Romans was concise,
short, to the point. "A letter of to
day is ten times as long as one of
antiquity. Neither man had anything
to say, and the ancients didn't say
it."
Even wall scribbling# of antiquity,
though obscene, were at least witty
and clever. Obscene nicknames also
existed, but never did a Greek or
Roman disgrace himself by naming
a child anything equal to "Ima
Hogg" and, as was recently reported,
"Ardice Grace."
Dr. Oldfather concluded his speech
with an appeal for "enlightened in
tolerance" on the part of the edu
cated against such practices as those
and similar offenses against Imd
taste, so prevalent today.
