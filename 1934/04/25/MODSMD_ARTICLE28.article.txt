# Walrus' Will Meet Tonight
## 
### 
A discussion of the current farm
labor situation will be held at 8
o'clock tonight in the Women's Club
house, sponsored by the Walrus
Club. The subject has been chosen
because of the many strikes that are
breaking out all over the country,
and especially because of the new
anti-picketing ordinances that have
just been passed in Santa Clara
County.
Dwight L. Palmer, instructor in
Citizenship, will speak for labor,
stressing the economic standpoint
more than the personal or political.
He will outline what the possible
solutions from labor's point of view
might be.
Crompton Bangs, graduate in the
School of Economics, will uphold the
farmer and will attempt to take a
more personal point of view. Charles
Schleicher, a Political Science grad
uate, will tell of the legal and politi
cal aspects of the situation.
During the course of the meeting
a petition to have the anti-picketing
ordinances repealed will be circu
lated. The public is urged to attend.
