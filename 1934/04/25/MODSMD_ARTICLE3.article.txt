# Soph Carnival Offers Novel Entertainment
## Rushton's 12-Piece Band To Play for Half-Price; Plans Features Weaver Heads Ceremony; Promises New Gags 
### 
For sweet charity's sake! That's
where the proceeds of the Sopho
more Carnival Friday night are
going —to the Convalescent Home
Drive.
And surely if Stanfordites find it
worth while to contribute dollars to
elect a Masque Ball queen, they will
find it more than worth their while
to spend one dime for an evening of
really excellent entertainment at the
Sophomore Carnival Friday night.
In keeping with th 6 spirit of the
occasion, A1 Rushton's 12-piece or
chestra has generously agreed to
charge only half of its regular price.
And A1 announces that several
snappy new arrangements will be
presented by the orchestra especially
for the carnival.'
Sorority Booths
Jean Anderson, in charge of the
sorority booths, reports that the sis
ters from the Row are going to have
some really excellent booths. The
Chi O's will have a particularly en
ticing booth where ambitious in
dividuals will be given an opportu
nity to smash milk bottles with
baseballs.
Alpha Phis are going to have bal
loons into which darts will be
thrown, while Kappas will sponsor
a fishing pool, Thetas a nail-driving
competition, D.G.'s a ball game,
Gamma Phi, bowling, and Pi Phis a
basketball throw.
Water Events
Winstead Weaver, who will be
master of ceremonies, has promised
to have a lot of funny new gags on
hand, and when Winstead says they
will be funny, well—just wait and
see. Diving and a water polo game
will be other attractions at this car
nival of mirth and merriment.
How such elegant entertainment
can be given to the public for a mere
thin dime baffles the imagination,
but surely no one can afford to pass
it up at that generous figure.
