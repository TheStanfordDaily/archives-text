# Quad Sorority Panels In Novel Arrangement
## 
### 
A novel arrangement of the soror
ity panels in the 1934 Quad has been
revealed by Editor A1 Sadler. In
stead of the customary alphabetical
arrangement of the members in bal
anced rows, this year's annual has
placed the women according to
classes.
Thus, there are three rows in cach
sorority panel with the members of
the three classes in the house rep
resented. The pictures of the pledges
have, as usual, not been included.
This arrangement has never before
appeared in the Stanford Quad, and
as far as can be ascertained in no
other university yearbook.
