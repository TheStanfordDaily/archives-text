Feeling miiong (lie women of Ihe campus has been al
most unanimous thai the new lockout rules were not all
thai they to he on the surface that they were
clamping down on the women's freedom.
This they undoubtedly have done, and the Daii.y wishes
It) add that this is in direct contradiction to the Adminis
tration's new policy of greater freedom of, bv, and lor the
students of the t'niversitv.
Senior women are, or should he, entirely old enough to
handle themselves completely. Therefore the I>aily feels
that there should be no lockout rules at all for senior
women. Such rules are entirely superfluous.
II the women, and the seniors in particular, are not old
enough to adequately handle themselves now, they never
will be. Granted the fact that freshmen, sophomore, and
junior women arc a bit immature (as women will be) â€”it
still remains that senior women are supposedly old enough
mentally to face problems of the world, inasmuch as the
practical side of a university educational program is to
prepare students for the years of practical experience to
come.
There is something more than a bit inconsistent about
the Administration putting stop-watches on the amount of
enjoyment the women of the University mav have. In one
sense it is giving them the freedom which they desire and
which is their right but in another, and more important
one, it is placing them in a harness of steel built out of
hands from the clocks and the bolts from locked doors.
