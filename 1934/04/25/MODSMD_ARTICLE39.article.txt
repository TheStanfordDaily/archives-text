# Scrape Off the Barnacles
## 
### 
Since I lie end of winter quarter, 1 lie campus has heard
of little but charity a situation which has crept lip un
expectedly and reached the point where students are get
ting thoroughly fed up with a lot of half-baked charitable
ideas which are destroying a few good ones.
At the moment, we have two movements on fool which
are worthy: (1) the Student Aid campaign, hacked by the
Hoard of Trustees, and (2) the Annual Convalescent Home
Drive.
They are line, but when social events and other all
campus events attach themselves to these movements like
barnacles and try to capitalize on a bunch of free pub
licity, the students should back up on their heels.
In the first place, the Student Aid caippaign is not char
ily in the accepted sense of the word. That point has been
made clear by (he trustees since the institution of the cam
paign. II is an effort to recognize worthy students who, for
reasons beyond their control, have not been able to attend
litis I niversitv. It is an' aid to deserving individuals who
want an education, not a plan to give money to individuals
wanting a degree. ,
In the second place, these other events destroy interest
in the important campaigns by spreading the publicity
over too wide an area. They are nothing but barnacles at
taching themselves to a moving object. If the campus
wauls the object to progress rapidly and smoothly, it had
better scrape off the impediments.
