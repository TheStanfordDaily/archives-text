## Playing Checkers for the Governorship 
### CROMPTON BANCS Jr 
Every day California's governor
ship race gets more and more like a
game of checkers. Moves on the part
(if one candidate or party are imme
diately met by the other side. Just
now, who has the jump on the field?
In the Democratic camp, George
Creel, State NRA chief, seems to
have made the cleverest move to
date. The Demo's main trouble has
been too many candidates treading
on each other's toes. Besides, none
of them could agree on any set of
issues.
Creel's Move
Creel cut through the ball of red
tape by asking John B. Elliott of Los
Angeles to withdraw and promise
him southern support. As soon as
(his is officially done, Creel will an
nounce hLs formal candidacy. So
much for Move No. 1.
Move No. 2 is a little more com
plicated. Elliott's withdrawal wiil
. till leave regular Democrats War
dell, Milton oung, and Malaby in ihe
race. The Creel strategy is to first
ask them to step aside for the sake
of a united party front. If this fails,
Creel's friends plan to take the issue
rii?ht to President Roosevelt to de
cide. Of course the odds are that
F.R. will not put his foot into state
politics, but it is the gesture of ap
pealing to the President that counts.
A Boost
Wardell may have to be boosted
into a soft Federal job to get his
withdrawal, but for the sake of the
Democrats it would be worth it. The
fi»»ld will then be clear sailing for

1 Mr. Creel, save for Left-Winger Up
ton Sinclair, who is conceded little
real chance.
The Democrats think they have a
good chance of winning with Creel.
In the first place, in Los Angeles
County there are more Demos than
Republicans—for the first time in
history. Then Creel will get the reg
ular Democratic votes, plus many of
the liberals, plus most of the labor
vote. That's a hard combination to
beat.
His main issue will lie Economy
and support of the New Deal. Every
! body wants the first; a good many
are still backing F.R. So it looks
like the Democrats have at last got
ten together.
Now It's Up to Jimmy
Creel's lightning moves have given
the Republicans the jitters. They
can't get together on anyone or any
thing. Jimmy Rolph still refuses to.
choose to run or not to run. His
job-holding henchmen hope he will
make up his mind soon. If he doesn't
run, they have a lot to offer the can
didate willing to go the furthest on
a job-conservation program.
! C. C. Young and Friend Richard-
I .son, both ex-governors, are dicker
ing for Conservative support. Demo
crats hope both will stay in the nice
to split the Dry vote—still pretty
strong and noisy.
So in running their strongest man,
the Democrats seem to have gotten
the jump—for the present. But re
member that Creel has enemies, and
anything can happen in a campaign
especially with Jimmy : till there.

Every day California's governor
ship race gets more and more like a
game of checkers. Moves on the part

diately met by the other side. Just
now, who has the jump on the field?
In the Democratic camp, George
Creel, State NRA chief, seems to
have made the cleverest move to
date. The Demo's main trouble has
been too many candidates treading
on each other's toes. Besides, none
of them could agree on any set of
issues.
Creel's Move
Creel cut through the ball of red
tape by asking John B. Elliott of Los
Angeles to withdraw and promise
him southern support. As soon as

Move No. 2 is a little more com

ask them to step aside for the sake
of a united party front. If this fails,
Creel's friends plan to take the issue

F.R. will not put his foot into state
politics, but it is the gesture of ap
pealing to the President that counts.
A Boost
Wardell may have to be boosted
into a soft Federal job to get his
withdrawal, but for the sake of the
Democrats it would be worth it. The
fi»»ld will then be clear sailing for

1 Mr. Creel, save for Left-Winger Up

real chance.
The Democrats think they have a
good chance of winning with Creel.
In the first place, in Los Angeles
County there are more Demos than
Republicans—for the first time in
history. Then Creel will get the reg
ular Democratic votes, plus many of
the liberals, plus most of the labor
vote. That's a hard combination to
beat.
His main issue will lie Economy
and support of the New Deal. Every
! body wants the first; a good many
are still backing F.R. So it looks
like the Democrats have at last got
ten together.
Now It's Up to Jimmy
Creel's lightning moves have given
the Republicans the jitters. They
can't get together on anyone or any
thing. Jimmy Rolph still refuses to.
