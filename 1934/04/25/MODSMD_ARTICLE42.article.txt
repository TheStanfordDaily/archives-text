AIRLINES â€” One of the most
amusing things in radio, in case you
haven't already noticed it, is the'
highly ingenious manner in which
the Burns and Allen-Lombardo pro
gram is taken off the air on the Wed
nesday night broadcast. Highly orig
inal and totally unpredictable, the
program's exit is always good for a I
hearty chuckle, and radio listeners |
who have missed previous airings i
(if- any) are depriving themselves of I
one of the best bits of radio enter
tainment on the air.
President Ray Lyman Wilbur of
Stanford, Dr. Robert Goixlon Sproul !
of U.C., and Dr. Rufus B. von Klein- j
smid of U.S.C. have been named 1
judges for a contest being con- i
ducted by sponsors of the "Leaders
of Tomorrow" broadcast. They are I
to judge essays written by young
sters of 18 or under upon the ad-|
vances which the world of science j
may be expected to make in the !
next 30 years.
