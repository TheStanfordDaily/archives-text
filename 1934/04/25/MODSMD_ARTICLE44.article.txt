## ASKS LOCKOUT CHANGE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
May I, as a friend of all oppressed
minorities, deplore the present lock
out system for women and urge that
the entire affair be put on a more
sensible and satisfactory basis. As
at present run, the sole effect of this
system is to inflict a series of jabs
and pinpricks upon the women
without in the least affecting either
their marks or their morals, the two
presumable objectives.
Men being inherently bad and
women weak, the lockout system is

perhaps necessary for that reason j
alone, but I suggest that such a j
highly unnatural and irritating sys
tem be administered as intelligently i
and reasonably as possible. Although
fearful of being unduly optimistic,
I think the Women's Council is
mentally capable of devising a j
slightly better system allowing some !
degree of elasticity instead of the j
rigid time-lock principle now em- |
ployed.
In other words, a series of petty j
technical infractions involving no i
improper conduct or neglect of;
i studies should not lead to the cul
prit being condemned to the seventh
i hell in a humiliating interview
with committee women happily blind
j to their own immaturity.
Such school girl "discipline" has
i not only lowered woman politicians
into contempt and ridicule, but is
also one of the reasons for the
"Winds of Freedom" threatening to
, die down into a mere draught with
! a bad smell. â€”L. A. Free
