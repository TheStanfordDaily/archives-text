## ON BEDPOST KISSING: A Lost Art 
### 
(In answer to a recent communi- |
cation regarding Garbo's kissing of
the bedpost in "Queen Christina," 1
our research department offers the 1
following handy information).
Bedpost kissing had its origin in
i pre-histrionic times with that lov- j
able old cynic Procrustes, who de- •
yised the ceremony as a part of his j
! regular proceedings. So popular was 1
it with all concerned that for a time
it became a regular part of the ■
Olympic Games.
The contestant was judged on i
both the quality and quantity of his '
performance; the-one who kissed the i
most bedposts with the most finesse i
was judged Chief Bedpostman.
With the decline of the Games, the !
art was lost in what historians call j
obscurity for several centuries, and 1
it was only with the Revival of j
! Learning that it again came into j
vogue. This time it was destined to !
have an even more spectacular his- j
tory, inasmuch as it became a femi
nine art, and something of a science.
Bedposts were kissed largely as an \
j indication of approbation, and (rare) |
for want of anything else.' In most j
cases, a single post sufficed—usually J
; the lower right; Christina, however, j
being Swedish, was a devotee of:
Ihe Lower Left School. In those ;
infrequent instances when all four j
posts were to be kissed, the order j
was invariably to the right (called
the Clockwise School).

The influence of the movement 1
was noticeable in the literature of I
the times. Shakespeare, for example, j
has Desdemona, Henry IV, and John ;
of Gaunt die in bed, while Falstaff
does not die in a basket.
characteristically, ignored the mat
ter. But Dr. Johnson remarked, ''Sir,
it is amazing."
The romantic reaction to classi- J
eism saw the decline of the old
method of kissing the post with the
hands behind the back; the new ap
proach permitted the use of the
hands on the bedpost itself. Nat- I
urally, this occasioned a heated con
troversy between the two systems, i
and various books were published on
each side; there is no telling how far
the debate might have progressed,
had it not been for one cataclysmic
event.
Suddenly (as all sudden things
will happen) bedmakers began man
ufacturing beds without posts. Im
agine the frenzy! It was not unlike
—nay, very like—that which ensued
among barbers and hairpin-makers
when women bobbed their hair.
Havoc! Degradation! Despair! 1
Chaos!
Whither are we drifting?
