WHO LS THE BEST
STANFORD ATHLETE?
Who is Stanford's best all-round
iilhlete is a question which has been
the subject of innumerable bull ses
sions from Encina to Sequoia and up
and down the Row. So far there has
been no feasible means of selecting
that man, but so far as we know
there is no particular reason why a
competition could not be held to se
lect him.
In order to be as fair as possible
to all types of athletes, the competi
tion should not be modeled after th 2
decathlon which includes only track
events but should include as many
types of intercollegiate sports, ma
jor and minor, as is possible. Such
sports as tennis, boxing, and wrest
ling would probably be hard to in
clude because they involve compe
tition between two men without a
means of individual scoring, but
ability in most other sports could be
measured.
WOULD INVOLVE
VARIED PROGRAM
Such a contest would involve a
highly varied program and would
give the small man an equal chance
with a big one. Among the events
which might be included would be
punting, throwing the baseball,
swimming, sprinting, jumping, dis
tance run, free throw shooting (bas
ketball), driving for distance (golf),
chinning, simple diving, and possi
bly others.
In order to be fair to men who
have devoted themselves largely to
one sport, but still have the ability
to be good all-round athletes, the I
events chosen should not be ones i
which require hours of practice but
should be of the type in which a j
fair amount of skill can be picked
up in a short time by a mftn with
good co-ordination.
IRISH MARATHON
COMES SOON
The annual Irish marathon, tradi- (
tional Stanford event, is scheduled
for some time in spring quarter and !
this column suggests that an inter
sport competition be added to the
program to select Stanford's best all- j
round athlete.
Naturally, it would be impossible j
to run off in one day all the events |
suggested above, and any others j
which might be added, but the com- j
petition could be extended over the
whole week, running two events a
day and culminating with the track
events on the day of the Irish mara
thon.
If enough interest is shown in the
subject, it might be possible to se
cure a prize or trophy to be awarded
to the winner and the competition
could be made an annual event!
