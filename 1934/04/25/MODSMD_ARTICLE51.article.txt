Sigma Nu hardball nine blasted
out victory over Sequoia I, 12 to 7,
with nine runs in the fifth and sixth
innings yesterday afternoon. Sequoia
roughs rallied in the first of the sev
enth with three tallies, but a braes
of pop-flies ended the game with
two men aboard. Leidig starred fur
Sigma Nu with two triples, and
Chuck Clancy with four singles in
four trips, while hurling good ball.
Shreve also got a triple and held
down Clancy's pitching. Clancy
fanned five and issued three passes
on balls, while Jung fanned six and
walked none. The game was won by
the burly-shouldered Sigma Nu
sluggers, who capitalized on every
break and stole bases with abandon.
In the Softball games, Theta Delts
battled it out with the Chi Psis, who
finally broke up a 17-17 tie by scor
ing twice in a second extra inning.
Credit victory to Labbe, defeat to
Hadley.
Fijis defeated the Phi Sigs, 17 to
3, concentrating on the first and last
innings to lace the over-size pill
high and wide. Credit win the
Downey, charge defeat to Wayne.

to beat Los Arcos 4 to 1. A.K.L.
