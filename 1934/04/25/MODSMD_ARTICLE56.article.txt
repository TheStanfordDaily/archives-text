# DEY, SEWARD OUTSTANDING AS FRESHMEN TENNIS TEAM ENDS SUCCESSFUL SEASON
## 
### 
Winning five of their seven
matches, Stanford's frosh tennis
players ended the 1934 season last
Friday when they lost to California,
G-3. The other defeat suffered by
the yearling netmen was inflicted by
the Southern California freshmen
during spring vacation.
With two widely known stars in
Ben Dey and Captain Bill Seward,
the frosh opened their schedule with
a 6 to 3 victox-y over the strong San
Mateo Junior College netsters on
February 10. A week later they
easily conquered Menlo Junior Col
lege, seven matches to two.
February 24 was an off-day for
the Papoose racquet-wielders, but
on Saturday, March 3, they defeated
Modesto Junior College by a 7-2
margin. The following Saturday they
won their easiest match of the sea
son with a 8 to 1 triumph over the
Berkeley Tennis Club juniors.
After a two-week layoff for finals,
the team went to Los Angeles and
lost a 4-3 decision to the Trojan
learlings, Tuesday March 27. The
next match was with Berkeley High
School's netmen, whom Stanford de

feated 6 to 2 on April 7.
The California frosh tennis team ;
proved to be without a weakness, i
and won a surprising 6 to 3 victory ,
over the Indians Friday afternoon, j
Ben Dey won the only singles match 1
in which Stanford came out victo- I
rious, and combined with Bill Sew- }
ard to win the first doubles after
three hard sets. A1 Dibblee and
Frank Taylor gained the third Stan
ford win as a doubles team. Dey
and Seward are fine prospects for
the 1935 varsity tennis team.
