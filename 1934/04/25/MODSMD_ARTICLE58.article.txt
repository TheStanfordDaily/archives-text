# FROSH TRACKMEN PROMISE UNUSUAL VARSITY MATERIAL
## 
### 
Although winning only 67 pef cent ]
of their meets, the i'rosh track team
brought to light several men capa
ble of performing in future varsity
competition. Bill Ellington's Babes I
won against the University of San
Francisco freshmen, the Alameda
County All-Stars, Sacramento Jun
ior College, and the San Francisco
High School All-Stars. In the de
feat column were San Mateo Junj'or i
College's powerful team and the Cal
frosh.
Bears Too Strong
The San Mateo defeat was only by
a couple of points, while the Bear
frosh were all "hot" at the crucial 1
moment to take advantage of the
Card yearlings' disastrous day of
injuries, falling hurdles, and general
tough luck. In spite of a somewhat
overwhelming defeat, there will be
just about as many good sophomores
on the Card varsity next year as !
Brutus Hamilton can boast at Berk
eley, and that, from one point of
view, is the prime reason for fresh- j
man teams of all kinds.
Two 440 men, Chuck Voigt and
Paul Green, have a, fine chance of
breaking 50 flat next year, and a
possible relay team of this pair and
Blackmail and Dellinger or Burris
would not be far behind any record.
Rusty March, Bob Alexander, and
Bill McCurdy showed sterling per- ,
formance this spring, and next year
should take places in all the distance
'races. March is the coach's idea of a
runner, as he can run anything from j
a 440 to a two-mile, and will be used
to plug up the weak places on the 1
varsity.
Evans in Hurdles
Ernie Evans will team with the
sophomores, Sam Klopstock and
, probably Hunt Kingsbury, for a
near-perfect trio of hurdlers.
Jim Reynolds and Geoi'ge Berg- j
man both put the shot over 47 feet I
as freshmen, while Mel Hurley and
Jack Walton tossed the discus over
130 feet. Ray Williamson and Jack
Carlson gave indications of point- i
scoring javelin throwing, having ap- '
proached 180 feet this spring.

When it defeated the Princeton j
swimmers recently, the Yale swim- i
j.miflg team chalked up its 125 th con- !
secutive victory.
