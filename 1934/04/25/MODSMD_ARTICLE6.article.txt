### 
Apparently feeling insecure in the
i fast receding waters of Lagunita,
! frogs of the erstwhile popular lake
! seem to have retreated to the more
favorable atmosphere of the Wom
i en's Gymnasium.
Feminine baseballers, going into
! the showers after a strenuous game,
j shrieked loudly yesterday on dis
j covering one of the homeless crea
i tures croaking on the tiles.
After the hubbub was over, they
I found that one of their more humane
I teammates, finding the frog in an
I obscure, dry corner of the cym, had
j picked it up and placed it in the
shower room. "It seemed to me that
I was its more natural habitat, so I
I just brought it in/' she said.
