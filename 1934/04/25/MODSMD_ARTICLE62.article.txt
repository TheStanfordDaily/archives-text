# CAPTAIN OTIS,LAW LEAVE TONIGHT FOR OJAI TOURNAMENT
## 
### 
Captain Chuck Otis and John Law, :
Stanford first doubles team, leaves
tonight for the Ojai Tennis Tourna
ment which starts tomorrow arid
continues until Sunday.
Considered the classic in Califor
nia tennis, the matches in the !
orange-growing Ojai Valley in Ven- (
tura County will see some of the j
leading intercollegiate stars of the j
state in action.
Oiis Meets Mako
Otis has been exhibiting excep- â€¢
tional tennis in his last two matches, |
defeating Intercollegiate Champ Tid- !
ball, and California number one j
man Holmes in masterful fashion. !
Whether he can defeat U.S.C.'s !
sophomore flash Mako is largely con
jectural.
Mako took Otis in a hard-fought j
match, 9-7, 7-5, when he met the j
Stanford captain in the U.S.C.
matches three weeks ago.
Team Undefeated
Law has teamed with Otis in .first
I doubles only in the last two matches
, since Sammy Lee was injured in an '
automobile accident.
The new Stanford first doubles i
i team hasn't lost a set in its matches
j against either Tidball and Myers of
j iJ.C.L.A. or Holmes and Smith of
i California.
