This painting, entitled "The Fleet's In," provoked considerable controversy when it was prepared by
a CWA artist for an exhibit of CWA art in Washington. After a protest by Admiral Hugh Rodman,
retired, that the picture was a reflection on American naval men, Secretary of the Navy Swanson had
it consigned to a basement. The artist, Paul Cadmus, said it was "not artistic, but absolutely true."
