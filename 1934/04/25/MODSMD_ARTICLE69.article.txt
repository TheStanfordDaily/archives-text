"All our preserved bones except
the closeted family skeletons are
| going to be assembled together in
this one nice, airy corner of the Bi-
I ology exhibit hall in the near lu
ture," yesterday stated Associate
I Professor of Biology Gordon F. Fer
ris as he paced off the southeast
corner of the big specimen room of
the Biology Building.
"Our skulls and femurs and such
have been scattered around long
enough and it's about time they got
j together," Professor Ferris further
ventured, as he explained his ambi
-1 tions for developing the rather small
group of teaching exhibits that now
adorn the walls of the second floor
of the Biology Building.
The bones and skulls are to be
! mounted behind a curved rail and
| will take the place of two cabinets
| of preserved human foctui and wax
I models of embryos which now stand
I in the corner where the bones are to
• be mounted.
