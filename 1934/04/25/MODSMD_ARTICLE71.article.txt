San Francisco may boast earlier
journalistic honors than its southern
rival, Los Angeles. The exhibit in
stalled yesterday at the Stanford Li
brary shows a fascimile of Volume 1,
Number 1, of Los Angeles Star, first
published in 1851, and an original
copy of San Francisco's Californian
brought out three years earlier.
The newspaper of nearly a cen
tury ago was vastly different from
Ihe one of today. A flood of want
ads and advertisements covered the
front page, and in the upper right
hand column where we of today in
stinctively look for the daily "big
news story," we find in the Califor
nian for 1848 the prosaic business
notice of a tinsmith. News value
meant nothing and all stories were
"buried" on pages two and three.
The newspapers, books, and other
materials on display come from the
private collection of Dr. Nathan van
Patten, director of the Stanford Li
brary.
The exhibit features some of the
more intricate and finer examples of
printing and engraving. Books deal
ing with the earliest printing in
British Columbia, California, Illinois,
and Quebec are shown. Some of the
best work of John Henry Nash, San
Francisco printer and publisher, are
displayed.
