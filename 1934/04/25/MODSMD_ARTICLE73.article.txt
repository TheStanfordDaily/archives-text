# BULL SESSION
## WANTED: MORE DISTRACTION 
### 
If we constantly mope over the i
fact that the world is in the dol
drums—and will probably be there
for some time to come, we become i
pessimists. If we are constantly tor- !
mented by such economic facts as j
"90 per cent of the wealth is owned
by I per cent of the people," we j
would soon land in the nuthouse, j
And if we experienced sleepless
nights and racking days over ihe i
exact moment at which the end of
the woi'ld would come, we might )
very well develop into a lot of pro- j
fessorial psychics or psychopathic
professors. That would be horrible. 1
Since we would avoid any and all
of these dii'e fates, people must have ;
distraction.
In the lecture room—when things ;
grow still duller—we fill in the
zeros on syllabus sheets; that re
lieves us of thought—and consequent
confusion. When Germans complain
that they are ill-fed and over-taxed,
they are sufficiently distracted by a
little official hog-calling and unoffi
cial pig-sticking. That relieves the
national tension. Russians have an
unending stream of Party cater
waulers to drive them to distraction.
What is our national anesthetic?
Gin does not satisfy everyone. So
every few years a national election
is held which completely relieves
the public of foolish fears about na
tional issues, and concentrates a lot
of time and attention on the glory
that was Republicanism and the
grandeur that is Democracy. Free
cigars, wild headlines, and mean
ingless speeches so befuddle us, that
by the time the campaign is over we
are really startled to find that our
troubles are still here. Such holi
days come but once every four years,
and if the people are not distracted
in the interim, they will once more
begin to realize that their stomach
walls have not ceased rubbing to
gether. That is indeed dreadful.
So Samuel Insull, one of the more
100 per cent Americans, obligingly
starts an international fox hunt with
himself as the fox. That is interest
ing for a time. As Insull lags, Dil
linger breaks from Crown Point with
a wooden pistol. There is nothing
that fires the national imagination
and deadens the national intelject so
much as a toy gun—unless it be a
real gun. That is fine; the country
is aroused over a real issue. We
have a new national hero.
But such things do not last for
evei\ The dope wears off. Which
means that in the absence of a cura
tive, we must have more dope. We
must have more broad or more Dil
lingers. —Dave Mellinkoff
