Leavers, the concrete foundation for
units B, C, and D of Lagunita Court
have already been finished. Within
a few days the men will start to
erect the steel. The new dormitory
will soon assume a shape.
A glance at the blueprints is im
pressive. The size of the construc
tion is tremendous: a huge central
court enters into four living units
separated by arcades. In each unit
there will be a lobby, a parlor, open
(ire-places. And not only has each
division a social room, but there is a
fifth for general use. Two dining
halls and kitchens complete the sur
vey.
