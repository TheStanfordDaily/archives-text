# BANGS, PALMER SCHLEICHER AIR DISPUTE VIEWS
## Agriculture Labor Strikes, Anti-Picketing Laws Talk Subject UNFAIR PRICES CITED Poor Living Conditions Are Cause of Trouble 
### 
In a brisk meeting of the Walrus
Club last night in the Women's Club
house, the question of agricultural
disputes was thoroughly aired by
Speakers Crompton Bangs, Dwight
Palmer, and Charles Schleicher.
Emphasis on the cause of labor
strikes in California was stressed by
Bangs, an economics grad, who cited
unfair predetermined prices as the
cause of agitation in the San Joaquin
and Imperial Valleys. Farmers, he
said, are forced to pledge the sale of
their crops to large corporations at
a chance price. Rising prices at the
time the crops are ready for har
vest, inflict an unnecessary loss on
the farmer which must be partly
carried by hired labor.
Palmer Discusses
Dwight Palmer pointed out the
intolerable conditions of living forced
on the farmers, and the violence and
intolerance of labor groups toward
impoverished farmers. Palmer, a
Citizenship instructor, pointed out
these conditions as the cause of
strikes.
Charles Schleicher, a graduate
student in political science, closed
the discussion.
Cites Ordinance
He cited, in connection with strikes,
the '"move-on" ordinance which pro
hibits loitering and obstruction of
Ihe highwaysâ€”including all proces
sions other than funeral parades.
Quoting the statement of a state
investigating committee, which
maintained that all the valley farm
strikes were part of a world-wide
Communistic movement, Schleicher
expressed scorn of such blind in
vestigations. He condemned the so
called deputies and peace officers
who use force and weapons to pre
vent freedom of speech and as
sembly.
