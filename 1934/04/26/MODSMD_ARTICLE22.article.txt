## Sword and Sandals Attempt Redemption of Youth 
### 
Tonight, with the reading of Lil
lo's "George Barnwell" in the Little
Theatre, Sword and Sandals makes
its first and last endeavor toward
redeeming the youth of our nation
from vice and infamy. Dozens of
notes commending the choice of
the sterling moral drama continue
to pour into ihe offices of the or
ganization.
Protests Made
One serious protest has reached
the hands of James Benet, secretary
of Sword and Sandals. It is voiced
by James Sandoe, who says in ef
fect: "You can imagine the shock
of surprise with which the an
nouncement that 'George Barnwell'
was to be presented greeted me. I
read the play several years ago, and
even at that time it had a dilatory
effect. I do not say that the woi'k
is immoral—it is amoral and un
moral.
Sandoe continued: "The scene of
Barnwell's seduction is hair-rais
ing. If admission is to be charged
(Editor's note: It is not), there
should be separate charges for chil
dren and adults. George Barnwell
is lewd, lascivious, indecent, and
obscene. The excuse that virtue is
triumphant is not enough. The fact,
too, that George goes to the gallows,
does not justify the fact that he has
such a good time going there."
Defense Answers
Sword and Sandals retorted in de
fense of the play, "The interco-or
dination of the tragi-comic motiva
tion of incident and serio-pathetic
characterization of the protagonist
in contradistinction to the simpli
fied elementality of emotion deline
ated is not surprising."
Meanwhile, the audience which
gathers this evening, in the Little
Theatre for the 7:30 o'clock curtain
will be able to judge for itself of the
merits of each case.
