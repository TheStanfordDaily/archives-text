### Warren Breed 
The Bruce Macon Tarver Memo- ;
rial Scholarship, to be presented to j
the fraternity with the highest scho- |
lastic rating plus the greatest im- |
provement over the past year, was !
oflicially sanctioned at a meeting of
the Interfraternity Council last
Tuesday night.
The scholarship is to take the j
form of a cash award of $150, which
will be given to the winning house. |
The house will thereupon give the j
money to one, two, or three of their
members, judged by the house as
a -whole, with regard to a basis of
general scholastic ability and finan- I
cial needs. Approval of the chusen i
will be necessary from the j
Interfraternity Council and the i
Scholarship Committee.
All Eligible
With this system in use, each of
the 24 campus chapters will have !
a chance for the prize, as improve
ment over the previous year is !
equally as important as relative
standing. The Council believes that
scholarship in general will be im
proved in all of the houses, for
there is great incentive, both mate
rial and intangible. Each of the i
houses on the campus will contrib
ute toward the fund.
There will also be awarded an
other prize, the Interfraternity i
Scholarship Trophy, which will be 1
presented to the house that shows
the best scholastic rating of the :
year, regardless of improvement.
Begins in Autumn
Competition for the awards will
begin next autumn quarter, and the
first presentation to the victors will j
be a year from that time.
Tarver, a member of Zeta Psi, was
vice-president of the A.S.S.U. and !
a football player. He was selected
for the title honor by the Council i
as an ideal fraternity man. Tarver
was always interested in the scho- I
lastic side of the University, until !
his death last November in a Bay
shore highway automobile accident. I
