## 
### 
Basketball Coach John Bunn,
hearing about the tests carried on
by U.S.C.'s Sam Barry and the oxy
gen tests of the Japanese swimmers
in the Olympics, decided to settle
the matter. So he is putting ten
men through a strenuous basketball
workout, taking their blood pres
sure before end after, and com
piling averages over a period of
about six weeks.
He calls it "Research in Fatigue."
The Japanese claimed that a dose
of oxygen brought about speedy re
covery to a swimmer, and Sam Bar
ry corroborated the fact. Bunn
thinks not.
"Patients'' and hoopsters being
used are Hal Edelen, Rob Lindsay,
Mill Lughman, Wytze Gorter, How
ell Turner, Bob Savinske, Charles
Schicbel, Bill Quade, Marvie ahn,
and John Gates. They take the tests
