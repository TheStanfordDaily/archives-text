# Rogers To Appear In O'Neill Play at Curran
## 
### 
A theatrical event of major impor
tance is scheduled for the Coast
Monday night, when, the Curran
Theatre will present Will Rogers in
"Ah, Wilderness!" Eugene O'Neill's
New York Theatre Guild success.
This is Rogers' first dramatic per
sonal appearance on the legitimate
stage, and it is a role peculiarly
adapted to his talents. He enacts
the role of the father of a large
family in this "comedy of recollec
tion"â€” the part handled with signal
success by George M. Cohan.
