We eat all that we are able.

the dining room fairly bristles
with overweight, underweight,
and complexion tables.
The gaining table, in a moment
of rare inspiration, while bliss
fully eating mashed potatoes and
cream puffs (to the envy of the
near-by losing table), concocted
the above tune, and rendered it
to the diners with true finesse.
