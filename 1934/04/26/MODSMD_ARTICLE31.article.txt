# Honor Code Earns Praise
## Millard Tells of Arizona W.I.A.W.S. Meet 
### 
''I was most particularly interest
ed in the Honor Code discussion,
probably because I was chairman
of it," said A.W.S. President Jeanne
Millard in speaking about her re
cent participation in the Western
Intercollegiate Association of Wo
men Students conference at Tucson,
Arizona.
'Few of the schools represented
make any attempt at Honor Sys
tem. Scripps College was the only
represented institution outside of
California with a real Honor Code;
theirs functions so perfectly that
they are actually unaware of its
existence."
Sororities Discussed
To assist in the discussion of so
rorities, questionnaires were dis
tributed; the main evils were found
to be heavy expense and rushing.
Other discussion groups were on:
orientation and freshman week; cus
tom and traditions; types of rules
and their enforcement; non-soroity
women; interrelations between men
and women and faculty and stu
dents; vocational guidance; co-op
erative dormitories; extra-curricular
activities.
Among the very interesting talks,
said Miss Millard, the one by Dr.
Joseph J. Spengler, associate pro
fessor of economics at the Univer
sity of Arizona, was outstanding.
He spoke on "The American Uni
versity and the Occupational and
Social Needs of Women."
Large Attendance
At the conference there were 100
delegates from 22 colleges and uni
versities in 12 Western states; 28
deans from schools along the coast
were also present. Peggy Taylor,
president of the hostess college, was
acting president.
In addition to the program, there
were many social events: luncheons
at Indian and Mexican cafes; tours
at the beginning and at the end of
the conference; a trip to Nogales on
the Mexican border; a tea dance;
and a formal banquet and dance on
the last night.
