In line with the I'niversify's policy ol' student control
in so far as il is workable, students have an excellent
chance lo assert llieir rights hv doing something construc
tive and thorough in the way of investigating the recent

mands straightening out quickly, definitely, and deci
sively in a none too gentle manner.
