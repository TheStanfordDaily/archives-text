It's great sport, Sunday mornings, to hike up lo the
fourth floor of Encina and gaze out over the Encina tennis
courts where scores of uninvited guests disport themselves
while Stanford students look 011 in envy, wondering if dur
ing the course of the day they might possibly hit at least
one ball over the net.
Encina tennis courts, opposite the Basketball Pavilion,
were constructed originally for the use of campus men and
women who enjoy a set of tennis once a week or so aside
from class work. On Sunday, these arise early, have a
good breakfast, and journey down to the courts. There
they either sit for a while in various attitudes of disgust
while several unknowns enjoy themselves at tennis, or else
they run off to other grounds to try their luck.
On the other hand, a keen-minded Roble Gymnasium
administration has solved the situation on the women's
courts by having Officer Davis drop around Sundays and
asking to see registration cards. Many a strange person
has found it necessary lo let Stanford people enjoy their
own courts lately for this reason. Truly a strange feeling.
There are plenty of students here who would like lo
earn a little extra cash and wouldn't mind working Sun
days in order to get it.
As long as the Encina courts also belong lo Stanford
students and the campus likes to play tennis, why not use
some of the various student aid funds to employ one or
two B.A.C. police to patrol the courts during Sunday hours
and let students benefit thereby?
The Stanford family would be a lot happier when it
came to Blue Monday and the curricular work that pops
up after the week-end of rest.
