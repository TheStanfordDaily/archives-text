# WHY IT'S NEWS
## Japan on the Spot 
### CROMPTON BANGS Jr 
Japan's unofficial announcement
of a Monroe Doctrine for the Far
East has borne plenty of fruit in
the past week. All the great powers
and their newspapers got pretty riled
about what some of them called an
unfortunate exhibition of Japanese
nerve.
Nevertheless, the fact remains that
this highly unofficial pronounce
ment, sent out as a feeler, is not
News. For some time Japan's posi
tion in the Far East has been tacitly
recognized as being similar to ours
in the Americas.
What stirred up the groat powers
was that newspapers wanted to make
it news; and have played the story
to the limit. No doubt the wily Ja
panese had hoped for exactly the
same thing. Witihout placing Japan
officially in an embarassing position
from which they could not retreat,
the spokesman's announcement
sounded out world opinion on a
long-projected policy.
Just now, what are the great pow
ers saying and doing about. Japan?
What does it all mean?
Reactions: In Japan
Japan's Foreign Minister Hirota is
having his troubles by the basket
lull. His greatest task is to explain
the Jap Monroe Doctrine so as to
satisfy the Japanese public:—which
approves it—without offending most

other governments—who disapprove
of it.
In America
At present, the U.S. has taken no
definite action, though Mr. Hearst is
still trying. The main task of Amer
ican diplomacy right now is to keep
out of two very bad blunders: (1)
We must be sure to join in whatever
joint stand the western powers take
on the Jap Monroe Doctrine—in
stead of being left out in the cold;
(2) We must join in, for of we are
left all alone, Jap public opinion will
be mainly against us—which is very
bad.
—In England
The English are more worried than
surprised. Japan has been cutting
into their Far Eastern trade; they
had nearly come to terms when this
happened. Another thing surprised
them too. They expected the U.S. to
do something right away. Instead,
Unclc Sam waited and passed the
buck to England. They want to
pass it right back again. Finally,
they had to act, so Britain asked Mr.
Hirota to explain himself more
clearly—if that is possible.
All this does not mean war. It
will blow over in time. In the blow
over process, things will bt* ex
plained and everybody should un
derstand each other better than be
fore. And mutual understanding
would help a lot here.
