ALL ON A SUMMER'S DAY
There is a tide in the affairs of
practically everyone connected with
the whirring presses which cannot J
possibly be taken at the flood —when
one would far rather read Saki or |
Dorothy Parker 01* .something super- I
ficial like Boswell's Johnson than |
bother about filling a column.
As a matter of fact, I am delighted.
It gives me an opportunity to air [
several of the pet whimseys which
have recently brought on a sort 01 j
mental torpor. Yes, a mental torpor, j
Doctor, and a sharp, stinging pam :
right here!
A certain radio station (not men- !
tioning any names) has a lost and I
found department, and their theme j
song is Noel Coward's "Some Day j
I'll Find You." (Get it?)
The current "Photoplay" has a ,
hoinesy, folksey chitchat column
nbout fan clubs,' in which are the [
following gems: an interesting is- j
sue of "The Harlow Herald" is soon '
to appear; members of the Gloria
Stuart Fan Club are extremely 1
happy over their new membership j
cards, signed by none other than
Gloria herself; the Dick Powell Club
is starting a special department for
shut-ins.

A new song called "Butter Fin
gers" contains a good deal of
straightforward autobiographical in
formation, about a girl who calls a
gent that because he (a) at 5 broke
her toys, (b) at 10 dropped her books
in the rain, (c) at 17 was careless
and almost got away, and (d) at 21
broke her heart. .... Neat, not
gaudy.
From a letter to Sylvia, Holly
wood's reducing whip: "I have ter
ribly bony knees and I hate to see
summer coming on, because I'll be
forced to wear a bathing suit. Is
there a remedy for that?"
No, deai% despite advances in sci
ence, summer persists in coming on.
Raised eyebrows dept.:
BEDSIDE
and
ALL OF ME
—Varsity Theatre double bill..
Statistics show that there are gre£t
hordes of people who think they can
act starving in Hollywood attics.
(Statistics also show that there are j
no attics in Hollywood, because of
the prevailing type of architecture,
the Hollywood bungalow.)
