Commenting upon the official
J communique of the Imperial Japa
! nesc Government released to the
j world last week, concerning Japan's
! new "Monroe Doctrine" policy re
j garding China, Professor Yarnato
j Ichihashi of Stanford History De
j partment stated that he believed it
j would mark the beginning of a new
era in the development and civilization —
|zation of China.
"Japan has no intention of mo
-1 nopolizing or exploiting China as
I see it," explained Professor Ichi
hashi. "On the contrary, she should
stabilize war-torn China, and ren
der the investments and interests of
the Western nations so much the
safer." Japan only desires to save
China from the fate backward Af
rica suffered from 1850 to 1900, and
the same spirit motivated Japan to
make this pronouncement as in
spired Monroe and his Latin-Ameri
can fiat of a century ago.
Rather than aiming at Chinese
domination, Japan is seeking to ef
fect a closer co-operation with the
Dragon Republic in preserving
pcace in the Far East, a policy in
keeping with the spirit of the
League of Nations. "Japan is not
seeking hegemony, but co-opera
tion," the professor stated.
Japan is the only responsible
Eastern power and feels a moral
obligation to maintain the peace
among her backward nenghbors.
There will be no end of the "open
door," but with the future peace
assured, economic recrudescence
will follow, with opportunity for all
nations.
"Japan's new policy is not aimed
at the United States in any way,"
declared the professor. Japan's pro
gram is to bring order out of chaos
in China, and end opportunistic ex
ploitation. In warning against as
sistance to China which might lead
to political intervention, Japan is
only doing what any other power
would do in similar circumstances.
Possibility of war in the Far East
is very remote, concluded the pro
fessor.
