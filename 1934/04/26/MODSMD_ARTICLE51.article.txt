# Chances for Rebates From Bookstore Slim
## 
### 
Chances for "a spring rebate being
declared by the Stanford Bookstore
this year are very slim, officials
stated yesterday. The losses of the
past two years have made tempo
rary discontinuance of rebates nec
essary, and the fact that the Book
store is operating under an N.R.A.
code is also unfavorable. Under the
code cut prices are taboo, and re
bates are considered in this class.
In prosperous years rebates have
often been as high as 10 per cent of
the net sales, and the last rebate,
paid for the summer quarter of
1931-1932, was 3 per cent of the
sales.
