## DIVORCE GRANTED: MENTAL CRUELTY 
### 
Some one asks why there is so
.little camaraderie between profes
j sors and students. It is too bad, la
i merits the questioner, for there is so
much to be gained from intimate
I contacts with the wise.
That is unquestionably true. There
! is also much to be gained from inti
; mate contacts with elephants. Yet
very few seem to get next to the old
' pachyderm, simply because most of
us have little in common with ele
phants—and if we did, we would
still be incapable of expressing our
selves to our lumbering comrades.
And so, except for an occasional
Tarzan or a Mowgli, the intellectual
abyss between man and elephant
appears overpowering. Thus, man
never knows how elephants manage
I to remember who the guy was who
peppered the peanuts; and elephants
never know v/hy men pepper pea
, nuts.
j The metaphor is probably a trifle
exaggerated, for professors do not
j too closely resemble elephants. Their
noses are ordinarily not so long, and
' their skins are not nearly so thick.
Still the gap between professor and
■ student remains as great as that be
l tween man and ihe animal kingdom.
The reason is triple. Many profes
sors are buried in books and musty
research. They regard any moment
spent away from laboratory or the
library so much time wasted. They
do not want to meet students; stu
dents do not want to meet them.
That is one-third of the story. Other
professors are ready to meet stu
dents, and no one shows up at ofiice
| hours except a scattering of apple
polishers and grade-crabbers. Mos l
students are indifferent to anything
more intellectual than the probable
outcome of the World Series. Still
some professors would like to make
j student contacts, if there were stu
| dents worth meeting. But to expect
I a man of culture and intellect to
spend extra-curricular time with a
lot of undergraduates who will al
ways be half-baked, is to believe in
miracles. The classroom is the place
for a one-way exchange of ideas. To
expect professors to transfer the sit
ting room into lecture hall, is to
question the sanity of professors.
Some students do meet professors.
There is good reason why no more
than a few do. There is grave doubt
whether more than a few should.
