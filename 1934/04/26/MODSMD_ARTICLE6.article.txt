Alaska-bound to study with 1' ather
Hubbard, famed Alaska explorer
geologist, Edgar Levin, who is a
graduate in Education at Stanford
and now working for his Ed.D. de
gree, will depart May 5 for the Val
ley of Ten Thousand Smokes, not to
return until next fall.
This will make the fourth trip for
the furtherance of scientific study in
which Levin has accompanied Father
Hubbard, who is known as the "'gla
cier priest." Hubbard is a professor
of Geology at the University of Santa
Clara. i
Going in the capacity of a survey
engineer, Levin will take along with
him "Wolf," one of the largest dogs
ever seen in this country. It is three
fourths wolf and one-fourth male
mute.
Set to leave Seattle aboard the
J. P. Harrison, May 5, for Alaska,
the Hubbard party of eight will be
composed of Hubbard, Levin, Tenith
and Roderick Chrisholm, two Fox
Studo film men, and famed Frank
Buck, the Fox "bring 'em back alive
man."
They will take along their own
plane and boat as well as dogs, sleds,
and other provisions and equipment.
For taking motion pictures 110,000
feet of film (approximately 20 miles)

| will be included.
The primary purpose of the" expe
dition being to study volcanic action
and geological formations in the
Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, the
party will maintain its principal base
j and set up auxiliary bases at differ
ent outposts. The plane will be used
i for excursions, provision being made
j for carrying dogs and sled aboard.
Levin graduated from San Jose
. State in 1930. His Master degree he
' earned at Stanford in 1932. In addi
tion he has taken work in geology
at U.C.
He is an ex-football player, weighs
j 220 pounds, and measures 6 feet 1
inch in height. He keeps himself in
perfect physical shape the year
j round in preparation for the strenu
i ous feat of Alaska exploration.
Levin, Chisholm, and Father Hub
; bard were the only three who dared
I go down into one of the volcanos
last year while it was erupting. They
braved dangerous gases which if in
haled would have been fatal. At
another time Levin was caught out
in a blizzard for three days.
Levin has just returned from a
J lecture tour of the southern part of
the state where he displayed motion
pictures of his past trips before au
! diences at U.C.L.A., Redlands, Occi
dental, Pomona, and La Verne.

which Levin has accompanied Father
Hubbard, who is known as the "'gla
cier priest." Hubbard is a professor
of Geology at the University of Santa
Clara. i
Going in the capacity of a survey
engineer, Levin will take along with
him "Wolf," one of the largest dogs
ever seen in this country. It is three
fourths wolf and one-fourth male
mute.
Set to leave Seattle aboard the
J. P. Harrison, May 5, for Alaska,
the Hubbard party of eight will be
composed of Hubbard, Levin, Tenith
and Roderick Chrisholm, two Fox
Studo film men, and famed Frank
Buck, the Fox "bring 'em back alive
man."
They will take along their own
plane and boat as well as dogs, sleds,
and other provisions and equipment.
For taking motion pictures 110,000
feet of film (approximately 20 miles)

| will be included.
The primary purpose of the" expe
dition being to study volcanic action
and geological formations in the
Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, the
party will maintain its principal base
j and set up auxiliary bases at differ
ent outposts. The plane will be used
i for excursions, provision being made
j for carrying dogs and sled aboard.
Levin graduated from San Jose
. State in 1930. His Master degree he
' earned at Stanford in 1932. In addi
tion he has taken work in geology
at U.C.
He is an ex-football player, weighs
j 220 pounds, and measures 6 feet 1
inch in height. He keeps himself in
perfect physical shape the year
j round in preparation for the strenu
i ous feat of Alaska exploration.
Levin, Chisholm, and Father Hub
; bard were the only three who dared
I go down into one of the volcanos
last year while it was erupting. They
braved dangerous gases which if in
haled would have been fatal. At
another time Levin was caught out
in a blizzard for three days.
Levin has just returned from a
J lecture tour of the southern part of
the state where he displayed motion
pictures of his past trips before au
! diences at U.C.L.A., Redlands, Occi
dental, Pomona, and La Verne.
Alaska-bound to study with 1' ather
Hubbard, famed Alaska explorer
geologist, Edgar Levin, who is a
graduate in Education at Stanford
and now working for his Ed.D. de
gree, will depart May 5 for the Val
ley of Ten Thousand Smokes, not to
return until next fall.
This will make the fourth trip for
