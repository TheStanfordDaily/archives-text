# Intoxication and Shock Seem to Be the Same
## 
### 
Judge Springer's court in Palo
Alto was informed yesterday that
there is little if any difference be
tween intoxication and shock. It
happened this way: R. E. Newson of
San Jose hitched a ride with Milton
Brown of the same city.
Palo Alto's alert police arrested
the latter for driving when drunk.
His passenger having apparently
partaken claimed shock; the court
believed him, but held the driver
in jail.
