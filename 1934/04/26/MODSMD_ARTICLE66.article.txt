"RACE OF CENTURY"
NOW IN 440
A few years ago almost every
sprint duel in any important meet
was billed as the "race of the cen
tury." The Pacific Coast was over
run with great sprinters and the
competition between them was keen.
Charley Paddock was still running,
U.S.C. had Charley Borah and fol
lowed him with Frank Wykoff, while
Stanford was represented by Hoc-
Dyer and Les Hables. In addition
many of the smaller colleges had
their stars such as Whittier with .
Nate George.
Of late, however, the competition
seems to be centered around the
440, especially in the West where,
with a couple of exceptions, the
greatest 440 men of the last few
years have run. The races between
Ben Eastman and Vic Williams of
U.S.C. a few years ago brought the
fans' attention to the quarter, and
since then the Eastriian-Carr com
petition, all three of their races being
run in the West, has been a high
light.
THREE OF NATION'S ]
BEST ON COAST
This year three of the nation's
outstanding quarter-milers are run
ning for Pacific Coast colleges and
their competition has caused con
siderable interest. Only Ivan Fuqua
of Indiana and Glenn Hardin of
Louisiana State can compare with j
, Jimmy LuValle of U.C.L.A., Johnny
McCarthy of the Trojans, and Stan
ford's A1 Blackman.
LuValle has already earned the
title, for the- time being at any rate,
: of the Coast's best 440 man, having
| bested Blackman early in the season
by about two yards and McCarthy
last Saturday by three yards. The
1 LuValle-McCarthy duels have been
going on for four years, the latter
j having beaten the dusky Uclan in ail
three of their previous races in high
school. Last Saturday's was their
first in college.
BLACKMAN. MCARTHY
MEET MAY 5
Now Blackman and McCarthy art?
scheduled to tangle in another great
j one-lap race May 5 in the Los A:?.-

geles Memorial Coliseum when the
Indians and Trojans meet in their
annual dual meet. In the excitement
of the Big Meet, Sianfordites forgot
all other track events which in
cluded the Bruin-Trojan meet. Th •
Trojans were big favorites and wo;
handily but the advertised quarter
mile brought 10,000 people to the
Coliseum, and nearly as much inter
est is expected to be evidenced in
the corning race between Blackman
and McCarthy.
The Indian is slighly favored due
to the fact that LuValle's margin <
victory over him was one yard le. s
than that over the Trojan and that
the time in the latter victory was
two-tenths of a second slower. How
ever, it is said that McCarthy used
very poor judgment in his race Sat
urday and if he did it's a cinch that
Dean Cromwell won't let him mak>>
the same mistake twice.
OREGON STATE FOUR

Oregon State's polo players visit
the Farm this week-end for two
games with the Cardinal riders, the
first this afternoon and the second

Charley Paddock was still running,
U.S.C. had Charley Borah and fol
lowed him with Frank Wykoff, while
Stanford was represented by Hoc-
Dyer and Les Hables. In addition
many of the smaller colleges had
their stars such as Whittier with .
Nate George.
Of late, however, the competition
seems to be centered around the
440, especially in the West where,
with a couple of exceptions, the
greatest 440 men of the last few
years have run. The races between
Ben Eastman and Vic Williams of
U.S.C. a few years ago brought the
fans' attention to the quarter, and
since then the Eastriian-Carr com
petition, all three of their races being
run in the West, has been a high
light.
THREE OF NATION'S ]
BEST ON COAST
This year three of the nation's
outstanding quarter-milers are run
ning for Pacific Coast colleges and
their competition has caused con
siderable interest. Only Ivan Fuqua
of Indiana and Glenn Hardin of
Louisiana State can compare with j
, Jimmy LuValle of U.C.L.A., Johnny
McCarthy of the Trojans, and Stan
ford's A1 Blackman.
LuValle has already earned the
title, for the- time being at any rate,
: of the Coast's best 440 man, having
| bested Blackman early in the season
by about two yards and McCarthy
last Saturday by three yards. The
1 LuValle-McCarthy duels have been
going on for four years, the latter
j having beaten the dusky Uclan in ail
three of their previous races in high
school. Last Saturday's was their
first in college.
BLACKMAN. MCARTHY
MEET MAY 5
Now Blackman and McCarthy art?
scheduled to tangle in another great
j one-lap race May 5 in the Los A:?.-

geles Memorial Coliseum when the
Indians and Trojans meet in their
annual dual meet. In the excitement
of the Big Meet, Sianfordites forgot
all other track events which in
cluded the Bruin-Trojan meet. Th •
Trojans were big favorites and wo;
handily but the advertised quarter
mile brought 10,000 people to the
Coliseum, and nearly as much inter
est is expected to be evidenced in
the corning race between Blackman
and McCarthy.
The Indian is slighly favored due
to the fact that LuValle's margin <
victory over him was one yard le. s
than that over the Trojan and that
the time in the latter victory was
two-tenths of a second slower. How
ever, it is said that McCarthy used
very poor judgment in his race Sat
urday and if he did it's a cinch that
Dean Cromwell won't let him mak>>
the same mistake twice.
OREGON STATE FOUR
MEETS STANFORD
Oregon State's polo players visit
the Farm this week-end for two
games with the Cardinal riders, the
first this afternoon and the second
Saturday. The Indians, with one <>''
their best outfits in years, alreai >
hold a decision over the Staters won
in an indoor game in the North
earli?r in the year, and have also de
feated the fast Arizona four.

"RACE OF CENTURY"
NOW IN 440
A few years ago almost every
sprint duel in any important meet
was billed as the "race of the cen
tury." The Pacific Coast was over
run with great sprinters and the
competition between them was keen.
Charley Paddock was still running,
U.S.C. had Charley Borah and fol
