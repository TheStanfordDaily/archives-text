# CARDS FAVORED OVER BULLDOGS
## 
### 
Sam Klopstock, brilliant Stanford
sophomore hurdle star, has been
confined to the Sluniord Hospital
with a cold, but he will be dismissed
tonight or tomorrow morning to as
sure his entry in the Card-Fresno
State dual meet this Saturday on
Angell Field.
Although Coach Dink Temple
ton's track and field warriors are
top-heavy favorites to v/in Satur
day's contest, the Fresno State lads
claim on their roster Walter Marty,
the world's champion high jumper,
who happens to be the same Marty
that cleared G feet 8 inches on An
gell Field in the all-University meet
of March 10.
Robinson Unbeaten
In addition Elroy Robinson, a
great half-miler, unbeaten in two
years of intercollegiate competition,
is one of Fresno's hopes.
Robinson has chalked up one of
the fastest times in college circles
this year, beating out Estel Johnson
of U.S.C. by ten yards in 1:54.7 in
the Fresno State-U.S.C. meet earlier
this season.
â€¢ Saturday the Bulldog star will
have his hands full when he hooks
up with Chuck Nimmo, Stanford
distance runner, who has run con
siderably better than I:SG for the
distance, and that being made after
the Card soph had run a grueling
mile.
Set Unofficial Mark
Last week, Marty missed 6 feet 9
inches by a slim margin. The week
before he failed on the same height
by this thickness of his trunks. On
April 7, he cleared 6 feet Wz inches
to set an unofficial mark, which
can't be recognized because there
were not a required number of
A.A.U. officials present to put their
official okeh on the record.
Besides Marty and Robinson,
"Pee Wee" Wilson, tiny Fresno star,
may very well give Meier and Klop
stock of the Indians a hard battle in
the 220-yard low hurdles. The di
minutive Bulldog star ran a 24.3
flight at San Jose last week on a
soft track.
Wilson World Champ
Wilson's claim to distinction in
the low barriers is comparatively
recent, as he first won fame as a
broad jumper, being a -former
world's interscholastic champion in
the event. He cleared 24 feet last
week in the San Jose meet, and his
duel with Paul Zaches, rapidly im
proving Card leaper, may prove to
be one of the highlights of the con
test.
In addition to these performers,
Fresno State has Bob Harris, a 48.9
quarter-mixer; Jack Ward, a 15 sec
onds fiat high hurdler; Ros Morley,
0-3 soph high jumper, who looks
and jumps like Marty; Darrel White,
consistent around 200 feet in the
javelin; Dick Lewis, 10 flat sprinter;
Glenn Hotchkiss, a 4:27 miler; and
Les Talbot, a 13-feet pole vaulter.
