# OJAI TENNIS MEET IS SET FOR TODAY
## 
### 
Facing the best intercollegiate ten- i
nis stars in the state, Captain Chuck
Otis and Johnny Law, Stanford en
tries, are awaiting the start of the !
Ojai tennis tournament in that own i
this morning.
Law and Otis entrained for the {
South last night, expecting to reach
Ojai in ample time to warm up for 1
the first round today.
The two Stanford men are en
tered in both the intercollegiate
singles and doubles. Not counted to
figure greatly in the singles, the
Stanford duo may come back with
the doubles cup if they play their j
best tennis. To do this they will |
probably have to eliminate U.S.C.'s i
sensational Gene Mako and his part
ner, Castlen, and Tidball and Myers
of U.C.L.A.
The finals in the tournament will
be run off Saturday, Law and Otis
returning to the campus Sunday
night.
