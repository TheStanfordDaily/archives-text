# L.A.A.C CARDS TO CLASH HEBE IN WATER POLO
## 
### 
After more than two months' lay
off, Stanford water polo players will
resume play next month in a three
game championship series with the
Los Angeles Athletic Club for the
Pacific Coast championship.
The L.A.A.C. team accepted a
Stanford invitation to play in En
cina pools Friday and Saturday,
May 1] and 12.
Olympic Team
The Los Angeles squad is made
up of the- entire Olympic team of
1932. This group reached the finals
in the Olympics, and has been
playing together ever since.
Stanford earned the right to com
pete for the coast title by winning
the Northern California Water Polo
League championship in eight
straight victories, and by defeating
U.C.L.A. in an unofficial Coast in
tercollegiate title playoff.
Coach Nort Thornton's Indians
have been holding their spring prac
tice for the past two weeks. Fresh
men and ineligible players of this
year, who are working out with the
varsity in order to gain experience,
will carry on practices individually.
Triolo Returns
The Cards will be aided by the
reappearance of Jim Triolo, who
has been out since before Christmas
with poison oak and an appendicitis
attack. Doctors said Triolo will be
permitted to swim again this week.
Captain Gordy Graves and Paul
de Silva, senior team members who
quit practice following the last
scheduled game of the year, have
returned.
