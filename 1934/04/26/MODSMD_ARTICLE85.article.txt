Emphasizing the qualities that are
required of present day successful
teachers, Dean Grayson N. Kefau
ver, of the division of education,
.spoke last night on the modern field
of education.
Salaries Vary
"They run all the way from $500
to $15,000 a year," he said. "How
ever, one Should not go into this
profession expecting a large finan
cial return. One must possess su
preme confidence and a horseshoe to
get into the highest salaried posi
tions."
According to the dean an ideal
teacher should possess superior
scholarship, a variety of interests,
social leadership, interest in people,
effective ability of expression, and
a true enjoyment of studying.
Field Uncrowded
"Most persons believe that this
field is greatly overcrowded and in
one sense it is, but we still have ap
plications for graduates and succeed
in placing about one out of five of
our students through applications
that are sent in to the University,"
he stated.
Briefly outlining the preparation!
that is necessary to obtain teaching !
credentials Dean Kefauver stated I
that it is necessary to take at least |
five years of college work with a I
major and a minor that support each
other in the subjects in which the
student, intends to teach.
During the latter part of the hour j
the dean answered questions from j
the lloor on different requirements j
of the school and the standards of |
scholarship required for graduation. |
