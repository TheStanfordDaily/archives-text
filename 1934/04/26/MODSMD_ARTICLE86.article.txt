AIRLINES—The question of Phi 1—
lipine readiness for independence is
to be discussed on the National Stu
dent Federation Program today by
Dr. Verne Dyson, director of the
New York Institute of Chinese study.
Dr. Dyson was at one time dean and
foreign advisor of Williams College,
Shanghai; was professor of English

Lovers of modern dance music as
played by Hawaiians and Cubans
will do well to listen to the "Music
from the Islands" airing tonight,
KFRC, at 8:30 o'clock. This is the |
second in a scries of broadcasts from
Ihc islands, and should, if the qual
ity of the first broadcast is main
tained, prove a revelation to cars
inured to the hard cacaphony of
American brasses.
