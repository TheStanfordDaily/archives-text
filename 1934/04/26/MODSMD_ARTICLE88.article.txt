# Atom-Splitting Scientists Find Elemental Particle

Atom - splitting scientists
found a new "fundamental particle"
of matter. It is the neutrino. Al
though it sounds more like a break
fast food than a scientific discovery,
Professor Felix Bloch, newest mem
ber of the physics department, is
authority for the probability of its
existence. "Probable," say Bloch,
"because if it exists at all it is too
small to be measured."
Professor Pauii, under whom
Bloch worked in Rome before com
ing to Stanford, first suggested its
possibility. Atomic nuclei, in ex
pelling electrons, do not always use
all the energy physicists think they

i should. What's left, Pauli thinks, is
used to expel neutrinos.
These are particles of matter much
, smaller than electrons, with no
charge, perhaps no matter. They
may be particles of pure energy, for
if they travel with the speed of
light, as Bloch thinks they may, they
I would, according to Einstein's rela
; tivity theory, have no mass at all.
Although first .suggested by Pauli
; over three years ago, first publica
| tion of their existence was made in
Italy only a short while ago. In a
talk last week at Mt. Hamilton,
Bloch gave the first public exposi
-1 tion of them in this country.
