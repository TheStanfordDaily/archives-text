### 
Graphic Art. Professor E. M. Far
i mer is under the impression that
! "the department is picking up vio
lently. I don't know if it is entirely
due to the increased number of
women or not; I doubt it. Art is
picking up everywhere. Both men
and women are increasing in the
department. The general enrollment,
exclusive of art majors, is 152, a
greater number than at any time
since the war. Last spring quarter
there were only 88."
Encouraged by the increased en
rollment. Professor Farmer is plan
ning an extension of the department
in faculty and in courses. Daniel
Mendelowitz will be a new instruc
tor next year.
After graduating here in '2G and
taking his M.A. in '27, he taught at.
the San Jose State College and
studied at the Art Students' League
of New York. He will instruct at
the University during autumn and
spring quarters and will be re
placed in winter quarter by Pro
fessor B. Bolton White.
In summer quarter, the graphic
art and music department will be
merged. The fusion wil comprise a
group of courses of general inter
est and cultural value: fundamentals
of music, appreciation of modern
music, appreciation of art, Russian
art.
Next year w. bring about the
enlargement of courses. In autumn
