nual Sophomore Carnival, a feature
entertainment of the spring quarter.
Promptly at 9 o'clock dancing will
commence in the Pavilion with mu
sic provided by A1 Rushton's 12-
piece orchestra. Dancing will con
tinue all evening, with brief inter
ruptions for skits by the Phi Kaps
and Chi Psis, as well as quips by
the master of ceremonies, and a half
hour interruption from 10:30 to 11
when those in attendance will trek
out to the swimming pool to see a
grudge water polo game, said to be
one of the highlights of the Car
nival, and exhibition diving by var
sity divers.
Booths Added
The various booths, which will be
installed along the corridor outside
of the swimming stadium, will re
main open all evening. Johnny
Miles, chairman of the booths, re
ports that several new booths have
been added to those previously an
nounced. Both the Fiji and the Theta
Xi fraternity houses are dedicating a
pledge to the Carnival.
In the Fiji booth the pledge will
be the happy recipient of pies
thrown in his face, while the Theta
Xi pledge will be installed in a pre
carious position so that baseballs
which properly strike a certain tar
get will release his perch and drop
him into the water. Ah, the joys of
pledgehood!
Hat Race Secret
Sigma Nu will sponsor a shooting
gallery, while the Phi Kaps will pre
sent a "horse race," said to be a
gambling game. The exact nature of
Theta Delta Chi's famed "rat race"
still remains a secret.
In all there will be 17 booths, 9 by
fraternities. 7 by sororities, one by
an eating club, and one by the Se
quoia roughs. The booths will be
erected Friday morning by the stage
crew, assisted by certain members
of the sophomore class.
Ten cents will admit students to
both the Pavilion, for dancing, and
to the Swimming Stadium. Tickets
for all events will be sold at a central
booth. All proceeds of the carnival
will go to the Convalescent Home
Drive.
