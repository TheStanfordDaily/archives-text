ever. The objection of a group led
by Howard Moore to the allowing
of second-quax*ter freshman women
to vote for Women's Council with
out a similar provision for men, re
sulted in the Committee's changing
the Constitution to allow freshman
men and women to vote for their
respective councils.
Changes Listed
Other changes made were: gradu
ate member of Ex Committee and
student members of B.A.C. specified
as men, chairman of Women's Con
ference, all members of Women's
Council, and the sponsor chairman
of each dormitory unit to be on the
committee appointing sponsors, pro
vision for music activities to be given
name of Music Council, specifying
that Men's Council not to be elected
according to preferential system.
The enactment article of the pro
posed Constitution is still not
drafted, according to Committee
members, but in it provision will be
made so that Dick Miles and Gene
Brown will carry over until next

ams and Sam Lee on Ex Committee,
nnd Chuck White on the B.A.C. Next
February the regular junior men

tion.
Forum Fails
Changes in the Constitution were
made as a l'esult of informal discus
sion in the room originally scheduled
for the Forum meeting. Forum
Chairman von Breton threw up his
hands and sauntered out when he
saw the size of the gathering, while
Fullenwider, the lone representative
of the committee present, gathered
20-odd objectors about him, and
sitling upon the top of Ihe chair,
attempted to bring conflicting viev/s
together.
Fullenwider succeeded in pacify
ing the minor sports group led by
Jimmy Triolo, yell-leader and water
polo forward, with an agreement
that difficulties would be ironed out
in the by-laws.
