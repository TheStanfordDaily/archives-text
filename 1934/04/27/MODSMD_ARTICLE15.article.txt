winter quarter Encina rebates, says
Business Manager Hal Whitfield.
This painless method of purchas
ing the annual has been made pos
sible through the co-operation of
Assistant Comptroller E. S. Erwin.
The price of the Quad will be .sub
tracted from the rebate in the ac
counting department, thus sparing
(lie freshmen the pain of handing out
the money.
Quad representatives are now
making a thorough canvass of En
cina to make sure that all interested
avail themselves of this opportunity.
The Quads are going fast.
