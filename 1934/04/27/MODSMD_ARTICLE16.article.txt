# Lyman, Marty Will Compete In Fresno Tilt
## Hi Jump Runway Widened For Record Attempt 
### Jack Drown 
Spectators at tomorrow afternoon's
Stanford-Fresno State track fest will
see in action two world record hold
ers and the co-holder of a third.
The two titlists in the persons of
John Lyman of Stanford, who pos
sesses the world's record in the shot
put by virtue of a tremendous 54
feet 1 inch put in the Big Meet last
week, and Walter Marty, captain oi
Fresno State's track aggregation and
world's champion indoor and out
door high jumper, will attempt to
break their respective records in
tomorrow's contest.
Runway Widened
At Marty's suggestion, Stanford
officials have widened the high jump
runway in order to give the Fresno
ace an opportunity to approach the
cross bar at more of an angle.
Marty's present outdoor record is 6
feet 8% inches and his indoor mark
an eighth of an inch higher.
After winning at 6 feet 6 inches at
San Jose, Saturday, Marty placed
the bar at 6 feet 9Vi inches and just
knocked it off on the descent. To
morrow he hopes to accomplish his
temporary objective, a 0 feet 9 inch
jump, and the necessary trio of
A.A.U. officials will be present to
give official credence to any new
mark that may be set.
John Lyman, who fived a shot
heard round the world last Saturday,
when he heaved the 16-pound chunk
of iron 54 feet 1 inch on his first
effort, believes that the record should
be farther out and will attempt to
place it there tomoiTow.

This season's performance of Ly
man in the shot-put is believed to
be the most remarkable in the his
tory of the event. He has put the
shot 38 times in competition. Only
four of those heaves have been be
low the 50-foot mark, while 31 have
surpassed 50 feet, 25 have gone over
51 feet, 11 have landed beyond the
52-foot flag, two have broken each
past 53 feet, and last Saturday's mag
nificent effort allowed him to enter
the thentofore unsullied 54-foot class.
Kloptock in Shape
Captain Gus Meier, Stanford's
great hurdler and co-holder with
Percy Beard of the world's record of
14.2 for the 120-yard highs, will com
pete in both barrier events tomor
row and will receive plenty of com
petition from his teammate, Sam
Klopstock, who was released from
the Stanford Hospital yesterday
morning and is in good shape for the
meet.
Stanford is expected to win the
contest without a great deal of
trouble; but Fresno State, coached
by Flint Hanner, former Stanford
track captain, has enough individual
stars in the persons of Captain
Marty, Elroy Robinson, great 1:54.7
half-miler; "Pefe Wee" Wilson, 24-
foot broad jumper and fine low
hurdler, as well as a half a dozen
other better-than-average perform
ers, to make the affair interesting.
Blackman To Sprint
Coach Dink Templeton announced
last night that there is a strong pos
sibility of A1 Blackman, 47.8 quar
ter-miler, running in the short
sprints along with Carl Thorns. If
A1 does, he will probably forsake the
one lap race, although he may ram
ble a lap for the relay team. With
Blackmail out, the heavy duty in the
quarter-mile will fall on the capable
shoulders of Brower Dellinger, vastly
improved and gritty 440-yard star,
who runs hi.s heart out no matter
what the competition.
Stanford's tremendous power in
the weight and hurdle events .should
give the Cards at least 40 points.
That's picking Captain Meier and
Sam Klopstock for one-two perform
ances in both barrier races and Ly
man, Dunn, and Reynolds in the
shot and Dunn, Lyman, and Buller
in the discus, giving the Indians a
clean sweep in these tv/o events in
addition to Johnny Mottram's cinch
first in the javelin.
Nimmo is being withheld from the
mile so he will be in the best con
dition for his widely heralded duel
with Robinson in the 880. Art Aze
vedo appears to be a cinch first in
the two-mile as does Bud Deacon in
the pole vault. Blackman, if hc
competes, and Thorns should take
the first two places in both sprints.
Fresno State is, of course, very
sure to win the high jump and it ap
pears very likely that Wilson will
cop the broad jump, v/hile Hotch
kiss, with Nimmo out, may win the
mile.

ble a lap for the relay team. With
Blackmail out, the heavy duty in the
quarter-mile will fall on the capable
shoulders of Brower Dellinger, vastly
improved and gritty 440-yard star,
who runs hi.s heart out no matter
what the competition.
Stanford's tremendous power in
the weight and hurdle events .should
give the Cards at least 40 points.
That's picking Captain Meier and
Sam Klopstock for one-two perform
ances in both barrier races and Ly
man, Dunn, and Reynolds in the
shot and Dunn, Lyman, and Buller
in the discus, giving the Indians a
clean sweep in these tv/o events in
addition to Johnny Mottram's cinch
first in the javelin.
Nimmo is being withheld from the
mile so he will be in the best con
dition for his widely heralded duel
with Robinson in the 880. Art Aze
vedo appears to be a cinch first in
the two-mile as does Bud Deacon in
the pole vault. Blackman, if hc
competes, and Thorns should take
the first two places in both sprints.
Fresno State is, of course, very
sure to win the high jump and it ap
pears very likely that Wilson will
cop the broad jump, v/hile Hotch
kiss, with Nimmo out, may win the
mile.
Spectators at tomorrow afternoon's
Stanford-Fresno State track fest will
see in action two world record hold
ers and the co-holder of a third.
The two titlists in the persons of
John Lyman of Stanford, who pos
sesses the world's record in the shot
put by virtue of a tremendous 54
feet 1 inch put in the Big Meet last
week, and Walter Marty, captain oi
Fresno State's track aggregation and
world's champion indoor and out
door high jumper, will attempt to
break their respective records in
tomorrow's contest.
Runway Widened
At Marty's suggestion, Stanford
officials have widened the high jump
runway in order to give the Fresno
ace an opportunity to approach the
cross bar at more of an angle.
Marty's present outdoor record is 6
feet 8% inches and his indoor mark
an eighth of an inch higher.
After winning at 6 feet 6 inches at
San Jose, Saturday, Marty placed
the bar at 6 feet 9Vi inches and just
knocked it off on the descent. To
morrow he hopes to accomplish his
temporary objective, a 0 feet 9 inch
jump, and the necessary trio of
A.A.U. officials will be present to
give official credence to any new
mark that may be set.
John Lyman, who fived a shot
heard round the world last Saturday,
when he heaved the 16-pound chunk
of iron 54 feet 1 inch on his first
effort, believes that the record should
be farther out and will attempt to
place it there tomoiTow.

This season's performance of Ly
man in the shot-put is believed to
be the most remarkable in the his
tory of the event. He has put the
shot 38 times in competition. Only
four of those heaves have been be
low the 50-foot mark, while 31 have
surpassed 50 feet, 25 have gone over
51 feet, 11 have landed beyond the
52-foot flag, two have broken each
past 53 feet, and last Saturday's mag
nificent effort allowed him to enter
the thentofore unsullied 54-foot class.
Kloptock in Shape
Captain Gus Meier, Stanford's
great hurdler and co-holder with
Percy Beard of the world's record of
14.2 for the 120-yard highs, will com
pete in both barrier events tomor
row and will receive plenty of com
petition from his teammate, Sam
Klopstock, who was released from
the Stanford Hospital yesterday
morning and is in good shape for the
meet.
Stanford is expected to win the
contest without a great deal of
trouble; but Fresno State, coached
by Flint Hanner, former Stanford
track captain, has enough individual
stars in the persons of Captain
Marty, Elroy Robinson, great 1:54.7
half-miler; "Pefe Wee" Wilson, 24-
foot broad jumper and fine low
hurdler, as well as a half a dozen
other better-than-average perform
ers, to make the affair interesting.
Blackman To Sprint
Coach Dink Templeton announced
last night that there is a strong pos
sibility of A1 Blackman, 47.8 quar
ter-miler, running in the short
sprints along with Carl Thorns. If
A1 does, he will probably forsake the
one lap race, although he may ram
ble a lap for the relay team. With

the thentofore unsullied 54-foot class.
Kloptock in Shape
Captain Gus Meier, Stanford's
great hurdler and co-holder with
Percy Beard of the world's record of
14.2 for the 120-yard highs, will com
pete in both barrier events tomor
row and will receive plenty of com
petition from his teammate, Sam
Klopstock, who was released from
the Stanford Hospital yesterday
morning and is in good shape for the
meet.
Stanford is expected to win the
contest without a great deal of
trouble; but Fresno State, coached
by Flint Hanner, former Stanford
track captain, has enough individual
stars in the persons of Captain
Marty, Elroy Robinson, great 1:54.7
half-miler; "Pefe Wee" Wilson, 24-
foot broad jumper and fine low
hurdler, as well as a half a dozen
other better-than-average perform
ers, to make the affair interesting.
Blackman To Sprint
Coach Dink Templeton announced
last night that there is a strong pos
sibility of A1 Blackman, 47.8 quar
ter-miler, running in the short
sprints along with Carl Thorns. If
A1 does, he will probably forsake the
one lap race, although he may ram
ble a lap for the relay team. With
Blackmail out, the heavy duty in the
quarter-mile will fall on the capable
shoulders of Brower Dellinger, vastly
improved and gritty 440-yard star,
who runs hi.s heart out no matter
what the competition.
Stanford's tremendous power in
the weight and hurdle events .should
give the Cards at least 40 points.
That's picking Captain Meier and
Sam Klopstock for one-two perform
ances in both barrier races and Ly
man, Dunn, and Reynolds in the
shot and Dunn, Lyman, and Buller
in the discus, giving the Indians a
clean sweep in these tv/o events in
addition to Johnny Mottram's cinch
first in the javelin.
Nimmo is being withheld from the
mile so he will be in the best con
dition for his widely heralded duel
with Robinson in the 880. Art Aze
vedo appears to be a cinch first in
the two-mile as does Bud Deacon in
the pole vault. Blackman, if hc
competes, and Thorns should take
the first two places in both sprints.
Fresno State is, of course, very
sure to win the high jump and it ap
pears very likely that Wilson will
cop the broad jump, v/hile Hotch
kiss, with Nimmo out, may win the
mile.
Spectators at tomorrow afternoon's
Stanford-Fresno State track fest will
see in action two world record hold
ers and the co-holder of a third.
The two titlists in the persons of
John Lyman of Stanford, who pos
sesses the world's record in the shot
put by virtue of a tremendous 54
feet 1 inch put in the Big Meet last
week, and Walter Marty, captain oi
Fresno State's track aggregation and
world's champion indoor and out
door high jumper, will attempt to
break their respective records in
tomorrow's contest.
Runway Widened
At Marty's suggestion, Stanford
officials have widened the high jump
runway in order to give the Fresno
ace an opportunity to approach the
cross bar at more of an angle.
Marty's present outdoor record is 6
feet 8% inches and his indoor mark
an eighth of an inch higher.
After winning at 6 feet 6 inches at
San Jose, Saturday, Marty placed
the bar at 6 feet 9Vi inches and just
knocked it off on the descent. To
morrow he hopes to accomplish his
temporary objective, a 0 feet 9 inch
jump, and the necessary trio of
A.A.U. officials will be present to
give official credence to any new
mark that may be set.
John Lyman, who fived a shot
heard round the world last Saturday,
when he heaved the 16-pound chunk
of iron 54 feet 1 inch on his first
effort, believes that the record should
be farther out and will attempt to
place it there tomoiTow.

This season's performance of Ly
man in the shot-put is believed to
be the most remarkable in the his
tory of the event. He has put the
shot 38 times in competition. Only
four of those heaves have been be
low the 50-foot mark, while 31 have
surpassed 50 feet, 25 have gone over
51 feet, 11 have landed beyond the
52-foot flag, two have broken each
past 53 feet, and last Saturday's mag
nificent effort allowed him to enter
the thentofore unsullied 54-foot class.
