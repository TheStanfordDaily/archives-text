Stanford Museum of Natural His
tory.)
Little-known by Stanford stu
dents, the large majority of whom
have never even seen the inside of
the Museum, many interesting and
worth-while oddities lie carefully
encased within its walls.
The different phases of interest
are largely divided into rooms rep
resenting natural historic periods.
The principal groups include the
Oriental room, the Egyptian room,
the early American room, the Amer
ican Indian groups, the California
room, the European arts and crafts,
and the Stanford Memorial room.
The Museum is under the direc
torship of Pedro de Lemos and i.s
one of the most complete in the
West. It accommodates approxima
tely 5,000 visitors a year. Many
school groups, including ones from
as far away as Long Beach, have
attended.
One of the most unique and val
uable of the Museum's collections is
thai in I he Egyptian room. There
history students may find actual ex

amples of various periods of human
evolution. In the main these include
the prehistoric, the old kingdom pe
riod, the middle kingdom, the new
empire, the late period, the Roman
period, and the coptic or Christian
period.
Professor Roeder of Hildesheim
University of Germany recently
evaluated the collection, stressing
iho great value of the objects and
the inability to duplicate many of
the types.
Ranging from vessels in pottery
and alabaster in the prehistoric cases
to reliefs and statues of the old
kingdom and the new empire to
more popular exhibits of mummies,
of both men and animals and the
mummy-shaped coffins of painted
wood of the late period; the Egyp
tian room unfolds truths of many
mysteries of past civilizations.
In this room are these excellent
examples of arts lost to present-day
culture. These are the embalming
process by which mummies were
preserved; sculpture work in black
besalt, a stone evidently carved with
comparative ease by the Egyptians;
and the making of fine linens which
were woven as finely as silk.

wood of the late period; the Egyp
tian room unfolds truths of many
mysteries of past civilizations.
In this room are these excellent
examples of arts lost to present-day
culture. These are the embalming
process by which mummies were
preserved; sculpture work in black
besalt, a stone evidently carved with
comparative ease by the Egyptians;
and the making of fine linens which
were woven as finely as silk.
