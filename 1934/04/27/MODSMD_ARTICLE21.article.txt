week's noted fiasco of Queen Elea- i
nor, the Kidnapped.
Campus keyhole aces were sur
prised to learn that telephone lines !
at the Theta house had been tapped |
all day last Friday, when Queen 1
Eleanor was missing, and that any
one who telephoned 6195 was auto
matically checked up by mysterious
and secret gentlemen of the Palo
Alto police force. It will cost Stan
ford about $2 an hour for this serv
ice.
Phone Parents
Phone calls to the Queen's parents
in Los Angeles, and a few telegrams
scattered over the state added to the
bills incurred. In addition to the
foregoing items, there is the expense
of a sheriff and a deputy who took
time off from San Jose business to
add their help in attempting to un
ravel the sensational hoax.
Delving further into the situation,
investigators discovered that Police
Chief Fred Frehe, who is looking
very, very glum these days as a
result of the several incidents of the
past week, wasted a good many
hours of official time in looking for
the abductors. His aides, Gordon
Davis and George Burns, also spent
a good deal of the University's time
and money in furthering the search.
Official Turns Sleuth
On top of all this, acting Presi
dent Edgar E. Robinson, Comptrol
ler Almon E. Roth, and Dean of
Men George B. Culver were forced
to act in the capacity of sleuths
outside of their respective depart
ments. adding to the mounting total.
Although no new developments
have arisen, researches by Men's
and Women's Council continue,
with the Rally Committee also in a
hunt for perpetrators of the hoax.
Official action will continue in the
event of further findings.
