# Refunds End For Concert
## 
### 
No more refunds on Rosa Ponselle
concert tickets will be made after
Wednesday, the Concert Series office
announced yesterday. Up to that
time the office will be open from 1
to 4 o'clock on week-days.
It is necessary to end the period of
the refund at this time, because the
Scries must close its books for the
year. A second period will be held
in ihe fall for patrons who do not
wish to turn their tickets in as par
tial payment on next year's Series.
Approximately $500 has been re
turned to date on the Ponselle con -
cert. An equal amount is expected
to be paid out by the time all re
funds are made and next year's
Series reimbursed for advances on
season books.
At present the Concert Series has
a balance somewhat over $1000, des
pite the Rosa Ponselle disappoint
ment. $100 accounting charges and
$90 in .salaries have yet to be paid
from this amount, but Prentice Mes
simer, student manager, is confident
that the Concert Series will end with
a profit, for the first time in several
years.
Settlement negotiations with Rosa
Ponselle are under way at present,
and it is hoped a favorable agree
ment will soon be reached.
