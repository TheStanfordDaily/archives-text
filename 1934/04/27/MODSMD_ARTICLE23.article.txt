# Opening of Union Lobby Doors to Be Postponed
## 
### 
The agitation for the opening of
j the Union lobby doors to women
cannot hope for immediate satisfac
tory results, according to Miss Chris
tine Rieker, director of dining halls
and Stanford Union.
A delegation appointed at the
Tuesday meeting of the Union Club
conferred with Comptroller Almon
E. Roth about the possibility of com
pliance with the request. The dele
gation was headed by Jane Hille
brand.
Comptroller Roth was of the
opinion that the present situation
cannot be remedied until whatever
[construction changes that may be
| necessary can be made. It is im-
I probable that any alteration will be
| made before summer quarter, when
I the building will be comparatively
vacant.
