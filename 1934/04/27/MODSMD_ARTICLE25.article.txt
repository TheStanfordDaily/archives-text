# Chlorine in Encina Pool Injures Two
## Physician Says Condition "Not Alarming" 
### 
An overdose of chlorine gas in the
Encina swimming pools early yes
terday afternoon sent Jack Damerel,
an S.A.E. junior from Los Angeles,
and Sidney Kraul, a junior from
Lindsay, Calif., living at Encina, to
the Palo Alto Hospital suffering
from partial asphyxiation.
Early last evening, Dr. Edward
Liston, the altendant physician,
stated that while chloi'ine poisoning
is "always serious" their condition is
slightly improved.
The cause of the accident was
faulty mechanism in the purifying
apparatus which is connected with
the pool pumps. The engineer was
changing the chlorine tubes at the
time, but a faulty adjustment al
lowed more than the normal amount
of gas to enter the water. Chlorine,
a yellow green gas when pure, at
tacks the mucous membranes of the
throat and nose and has a highly
irritating effect, capable, in extreme,
cases, of producing suffocation and
death.
At 1:45 Nort Thornton, swimming
instructor, returned to the pool and
found the two boys in "a rather bad
way." He immediately got a doctor
from the BA.C., who sent for an
ambulance.
