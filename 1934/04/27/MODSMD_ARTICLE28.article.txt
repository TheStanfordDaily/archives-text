# FARM STUDENT'S DEATH MYSTERY; FRESHMAN HELD
## Peter Jewett Found Dead Near Lagunita Yesterday; Autopsy Shows Hemorrhage; Investigation To Involve Three Other Students 
### BOB CALKINS 
JJNCLIITAIN as to what caused the death of Peter Jewett, 19-year-old
freshman, Santa Clara County officers were holding as a material wit
ness Dalton Henderson, ';57, who went on a party in San Francisco with th<*
dead student Tuesday night, and who awakened yesterday morning in their
car near the Lagunita Boathouse to find him dead.
An autopsy conducted by Dr. Frederick Proeseher, Santa Clara path
ologist who performed one of Lamson's autopsies, showed that a blow had
been inflicted in back of Jewett's left ear, causing a hemorrhage of the
brain, and his death.

* A preliminary investigation by Dr.
Proescher at the Palo Alto mortuary
indicated that there were no traces
of liquor about Jewett's body.
Having been involved in a minor
accident when their car struck a
telephone pole near the stadium at
about 3 o'clock yesterday, and in an
argument at a sandwich parlor north
of Atherton, it had not been deter
mined at a late hour last night how
the injury was incurred.
Five Involved
Five other characters were in
volved in the freshman's death last
night when Deputy District Attorney
Harold Anderson of San Mateo
County disclosed the story of Jack
Goldthwaite, proprietor of the sand
wich parlor, who told of Henry Ever
sole '37, Tom Greenough '37, Wil
liam Brownell '37, Frank Oellerich,
Redwood City, and Miss Marion
Hougham of Redwood City, who
were also involved in the argument.
According to Goldthwaite, Ever
sole, Greenough, and Brownell had
been in the place at several different
times during the evening. When
Jewett and Henderson entered about
12:30 o'clock yesterday morning, Oel
lerich and his girj friend were there,
with the three other students coming
in a few minutes later.
A remark was made by one of the
students, Goldthwaite didn't know
which one, and Oellerich answered,
Anderson's account continued.
Thereupon, Henderson, without any
warning, hit Oellerich in the face,
cutting his lip. Goldthwaite said he
then picked up a stick made from
the slim end of a billiard cue, and
whacked Henderson once on the seal
and once on the shoulder as he
ushered the students outside.
Loud Thud Heard
Shortly after, Goldthwaite said he
heard a loud thud, as though some
one had bumped a car door. The
patrons of his place then left, Goldth
waite said. Both he and Oellerich
' were questioned by San Mateo
County police yesterday but were
not held. Attorney Anderson will
conduct a more thorough investiga
tion today, he said.
Adding to the conflicting stories
already advanced, Eversole late last
night stated that he and the other
two left Atherton before any scuffle
occurred. He also said that he and
Brownell brought Greenough back
to the campus with them, but that
Greenough had come to the place
with Jewett and Henderson.
According to Henderson, who was
questioned yesterday by Fred Frehe,
campus deputy sheriff, Santa Clara
County Sheiiff William J. Emig, and
Deputy Sheriff Howard Buffington,
he and Jewett went to a San Fran
cisco hotel last night with two Stan
ford women.
Eversole also denied having been
at the place more than once that
evening, and said he and Brownell
stopped there on their way back
from San Mateo.
He said the only scuffling was in a
boxing match between Brownell and
Greenough when Greenough jok
ingly said he "wanted to push a crest
on his ring into Brownell's cheek."
Returning to the campus at 2:20
o'clock, they took the women to their
dormitory and went to the Atherton
sandwich shop. After two drinks of
beer, and the argument with the
other natrons, they returned to Stan
