# A 						Mind of Our Own?

Lack of atlcndance at last night's widely publicized
Student Forum, called to consider the proposed A.S.S.I 1 .
Constitution, was certainly no credit to an apparently dis
interested Stanford student body.
An overwhelming majority defeated last week's pro
posal by about <i 2, indicating that the campus might have
serious objections to the document. That was all right, and
a new committee was appointed to further revise the con
stitution. The campus intended to express its ideas on the
subject yesterday, and prepare a completed draft that will
satisfy the electorate at next week's vole. Hurrah.
Twenty people showed up last night, and went home
without doing much. If only that number are interested
in the constitution, why should A.S.S.C. officers be com
pelled to worry about securing better student government?
Hut Stanford dors want an improved form of control,
and the vote registered last week proves as much. The
interested parties didn't play ball last night, and the Daily
still sees some objections that might be ironed out tit Mon
day's final hearing before the Kx Committee. The, Daily
likes the improvements already made, and awaits the
action.
Shall we snap out of it ?
