# 1934: A Question of Ethics
## 
### 
There arc many who admit a popular lack of adher
ence lo any rigid ethical standard, hut those who were
privileged to watch the antics of one typical "motion pic
tnre" reporter in particular sent down to cover tiie tragic
story that broke here yesterday saw a new low in methods
of fair play.
Stanford h;is long been troubled with Hay Region news
papers that have persisted in spreading false reports of
campus news over their front pages., This situaliop, for
tunately, was ironed out satisfactorily since inside offices
of the publications have agreed to co-operate on this
matter of gross over-play. The Daily breathed easier until
yesterday.
When campus correspondents got together with metro
politan reporters lo learn as much as possible, il was an
unusually sad sight to view the comedian sent by an en
terprising paper with two assistants, including a photogra
pher, to cover the affair. The Daily, realizing that his
employers probably were mosl sincere in requesting full
coverage, having been one of lite first to play fair with Ihc
campus in past cases, objects lo the tactics of the individ
ual rather than Ihc paper.
Also realizing the need of getting the facts in loto, it
points out thai there are two ways to do the job. One is
ethical, and the oilier is anything else but.
Attempts yesterday to exert high pressure on individ
uals concerned, trying to force people into saying and
doing filings against their will, did anything but gain
friends for the newspaper concerned either here or in
Palo Alto, where the actions were duplicated.
Student reporters tire supposed to look up lo their pro
fessional contemporaries, and hope lo learn some practical
journalism thereby. The Daily hopes that student jour
nalists will not have to resort lo any tactics as displayed
yesterday in order lo produce a slorv.
