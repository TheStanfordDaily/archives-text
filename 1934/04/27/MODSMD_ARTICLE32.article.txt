# WHY IT'S NEWS
## F.R.'s Spring House Cleaning 
### CROMPTON BANCS Jr 
Well into his second spring in
office, the President is trying to size
up the New Deal. His main policy
during his first year was that of
Experiment. The time has now come
to overhaul his policies, throwing
out those which have failed to work.
At the same time, the Adminis
tration will be forced to admit that
it was wrong on some things. Jn
other words, an era of facing the
facts is now beginning. What poli
cies have failed to work, and what
will be done about them? .
Mistakes Admitted
The NRA itself admits it is not
all it was cracked up to be. This is
probably because of too much bal
lyhoo and too much speed last sum
mer. This led many to htfpc pros
perity would return overnight. When
it didn't, the Blue Eagle got his first
black eye.
It is now admitted that the NRA
tried to control industry too much.
The code will be kept, but industry
will run itself; the government will
he more on the sidelines. Other
good points will be kept; the bad
ones will be eliminated.
Most of the Administration is
willing to admit th.'it the Air Mail
cancellations were their worst mis
lake. The experiment of letting the
Army carry the mails v/as even
worse. Now the Air Mail is going
back to private lines—for good.
Some of F.R.'s friends and Mr.

I Farley are still trying to whitewash
! themselves. This is bad. An Admin
istration willing to admit its mis
takes stands a much better chance
for re-election than one whicH tries
to weasel on its errors.
Even Senator Wagner himself ad
mits his anti-company union bill
was too severe. It kept the employ
j ers from doing anything and let la
bor do everything it wanted. This
I will be changed, and labor will have
I to behave, too.
Mistakes Not Admitted
There are still some things which
F.R. is not yet willing to admit as
j mistakes, though most people think
1 they are. In the first place, the Presi
dent still refuses to believe the NRA
is squeezing the "little fellow." There
is plenty cf evidence that it is, and
1 that monopoly is on the upgrade.
The Brain Trust is still unwilling
to admit the Securities Act is too
severe. The fact is that it has just
about stopped the issuance of stocks
and bonds in its attempt to get rid of
crooked promoters. But what's the
use of killing the dog to get rid of
the fleas? Until something is done
about this situation, Recovery will
I be in a rut.
After all, the thing to remember
is this: F.R. has admitted his pro
gram is one of trial and error; it
was not or is not "planned." This
i gives him a free hand to keep v/hat
| works and to discard what doesn't.

it was wrong on some things. Jn
other words, an era of facing the
facts is now beginning. What poli

will be done about them? .
Mistakes Admitted
The NRA itself admits it is not
all it was cracked up to be. This is
probably because of too much bal
lyhoo and too much speed last sum
mer. This led many to htfpc pros
perity would return overnight. When
it didn't, the Blue Eagle got his first
black eye.
It is now admitted that the NRA
tried to control industry too much.
The code will be kept, but industry
will run itself; the government will
he more on the sidelines. Other
good points will be kept; the bad
ones will be eliminated.
Most of the Administration is
willing to admit th.'it the Air Mail
cancellations were their worst mis
lake. The experiment of letting the
Army carry the mails v/as even
worse. Now the Air Mail is going
back to private lines—for good.
Some of F.R.'s friends and Mr.

I Farley are still trying to whitewash
! themselves. This is bad. An Admin
istration willing to admit its mis
takes stands a much better chance
for re-election than one whicH tries
to weasel on its errors.
Even Senator Wagner himself ad
mits his anti-company union bill
was too severe. It kept the employ
j ers from doing anything and let la
bor do everything it wanted. This
I will be changed, and labor will have
I to behave, too.
Mistakes Not Admitted
There are still some things which
F.R. is not yet willing to admit as
j mistakes, though most people think
1 they are. In the first place, the Presi
dent still refuses to believe the NRA
is squeezing the "little fellow." There
is plenty cf evidence that it is, and
1 that monopoly is on the upgrade.
The Brain Trust is still unwilling
to admit the Securities Act is too
severe. The fact is that it has just
about stopped the issuance of stocks
and bonds in its attempt to get rid of
crooked promoters. But what's the
use of killing the dog to get rid of
the fleas? Until something is done
about this situation, Recovery will
I be in a rut.
After all, the thing to remember
is this: F.R. has admitted his pro
gram is one of trial and error; it
was not or is not "planned." This
i gives him a free hand to keep v/hat
| works and to discard what doesn't.
Well into his second spring in
office, the President is trying to size
up the New Deal. His main policy
during his first year was that of
Experiment. The time has now come
to overhaul his policies, throwing
out those which have failed to work.
At the same time, the Adminis
tration will be forced to admit that
it was wrong on some things. Jn
