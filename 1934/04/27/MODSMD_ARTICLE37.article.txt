# BULL SESSION
## A 						DREAM TALKING 
### 
As we write this, Forum leaders
are feverishly preparing ' pros" and i
"cons" for the evening's intellectual !
discussion of that campus institution
which has come to be known as the
' Pi'oposed Constitution."
Three sorts of people go to Forum |
meetings: The "pros," who go to the
meeting "pro" and come back
proer"; the "cons," who go "con" and
come back in the comparative or
superlative of their convictions; and
the habitual Forumites, who go 1
whether or not there is a "pro" or a
"con," and come back happier if
there is neither.
Everyone enjoys himself. Evex'y
one is convinced that he was right
in the first place. No one grows bit
ter. Everyone does a good deal of
laughing, and a little unacademic
sneering. After an hour and a half
of by-piay between the chairman, a
few rebels in the audience, and an
occasional remark from the speakers
of the evening everyone goes home
satisfied. And Forumites are con
vinced that the meeting has been a
success; which it has.
It is one of the more intellectual

amusements, a good sideshow. But
as now constituted, the Forum is no
place to present campus issues to
campus voters. The herd of campus
sheep (which the B.A.C. has not sold,
despite reports to the contrary) does
not turn up at Forum meetings. Con
sequently, the herd is led to the polls
by a few powerful shepherds who
might know what they want.
For discussion of such unimportant
subjects as "Militarism versus Pacifi
cism," and "Capitalism versus Com
munism," the Forum is excellent as
is. But when something really im
portant and fundamental is up for
discussion, such as "Smoking on the
Quad" or "The Proposed Constitu
tion," Forum must rise to the occa
sion, and entice to its meeting the
campus, en masse. Perhaps door-to
door solicitation will do the triclc;
perhaps free cigars, or doughnuts
and cider are necessary. Something
must be done. The campus must be
come excited over its vital issues.
This is a democratic campus, and
it must be run as a democracy is run.
We have the hot air; we need the
free cigars, or doughnuts and cider.
