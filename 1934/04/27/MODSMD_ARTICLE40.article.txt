REGISTERED NURSE
(First National)
At the Varsity Theatre
Although possessed of a cut and
dried plot, "Registered Nurse" still
manages to become highly entertain
ing through the medium of excellent
acting and a hospital setting that
allows full play for a line cast to run
the gamut of human emotions.
Bebe Daniels, who usually man
ages to be a bit boring, seems en
tirely natural in her role as the lover
who promises marriage but runs
when hubby clears the way by com
mitting suicide, and John Halliday
is fine as the woman-hater (until he
meets Bebe) who finally wins the
hand of his very capable assistant.
However, honors must go to mi
nor members of the cast, who, with
out exception, do a spjendid job.
Gordon Westcott is particularly fine
as the husband who goes insane
when struck on the head in an au
tomobile wreck. —Honan.
