Frankie is a green parakeet.
Johnny no. 1, pecked on the
head, was green; Johnny no 2,
dead from heart failure, was
blue; Johnny no. 3, not yet de
ceased, is yellow.
Frankie and Johnny no. 3
have enjoyed themselves since
the last death by breaking all
Roble's quiet regulations par
ticularly before 7 o'clock in the
morning when they hold con
certs with the quail outside
the window. ,
Otherwise, Roble's pets at
present are inoffensive, consist
ing of but two minute goldfish,
unless there are others care
fully hidden. Frankie and
Johnny are the first dangerous
animals in Roble since the days
of the cat whose milk-appetite
was ruined by too much beer.
