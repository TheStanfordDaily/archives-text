The appearance of three world
record holders, Walter Marty, John
Lyman, and Gus Meier, on Angeil
Field tomorrow, brings up the ques
tion of just how far the limits of
human ability will carry trackmen
in their quest for new marks. The
epidemic of record-breaking which
has .swept the track world for tha
past few years has seen almost every
mark on the books go to the board.
It is becoming o common now that
almost every meet is billed with an
added attraction of some athlete'.,
'going after a new record.
Since so many records arc being
set up, one wonders just when the
limit will be reached. There must he
a point beyond which no man can
throw lf» pounds of iron or a time
below which it is humanly impos
sible to run a 100 yards.
Some have claimed that the limit
has already been reached in the 100-
yard dash with Frank WykofFs rec
ord of 9.4, while others claim that
someone_will run 9.2 in the near iu
ture, Bob Keisel being pointed out
as one capable of that time. At any
rate there were athletes as much fts
20 years ago who negotiated the dis
tance in 9.6 and that is still consid
ered fast time.
Take the case of the pole vault,
however. Not so many years ago
anyone who could go 12 feet was a
champion. Nov/ it takes 13 feet 10
place in most meets, and Bill Gra
der's record, now being applied for,
js 14 feet s"'.h inches. There are prob
ably half a dozen men in the coun
try today who can clear 14 feet.
Record-breaking seems to be in
fectious. Ted Merideth's quarter
mile mark stood for years before
Ben Eastman and Vic Williams of
-U.S.C. equaled it in 1931. The next
year "Blazing Ben" knocked a full
second oIT it, lowering it to 46.4 and
now the Pacific Coast alone has three
440 men capable of running below
Merideth's mark.
The. shot-put is another ev?nt
which has seen many new marks re
cently. For years no one was able
to push the shot out over 50 feet and
threaten Ralph Rose'.s record, but a
few years ago somebody did it. and
now the uno..cial mark has climbed
over 54 feet with the claim being
made that Lyman will toss 11 over
55 feet, and if he doesn't, that Jack
Torrance will.
Harold Osborne's high jump mark
of (J feet Br,>;8 r, >; inches stood from 124
to 1934 when Walter Marty cracked
it. Since then he has o..cially lifted
it once and .several more times un
ci. .dally. They plan to have A.A.U.
officials on hand at Angell Field to
morrow in case he breaks it again in
he Stanford-Fresno State meet.
Percy Keard, during an orgy of
record-breaking hurdle races which
saw the world mark shattered un
officially several times, set up an of
ficial record of 14.2 which was im
inedialelv tied by («us Meier last
year. Now Sam Klopsiock, with a
nark of 14.5 in his sophomore year,
has an excellent chance of erasing
the present time before he hangs up
his spikes.
The broad jump and javelin are
the only events which haven't been
threatened in the last few years, at
least by Americans .since a Japanese
thlete leaped over 26 feet last year,
lout they say Ohio Slate's great Ne
gro freshman, Jess Owens, will hang
up a new broad jump mark before
lie is through. The distances also
haven't been attacked with much
gusto in this country, except for the
mile during the past year, and it is
nrobably in these events that Amer
icans will show the greatest im
provement in the next few years.
