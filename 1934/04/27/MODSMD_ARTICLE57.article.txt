# Indian Nine Meets Gaels Here Tomorrow
## ANDERSON SLATED TO PITCH; WOLTER EXPECTS VICTORY 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon on the sunk
en diamond following the Card-
Fresno track meet the Stanford
baseball varsity closes its 1934 sea
j son with a nine-inning tussle with
I the Gaels, the vastly improved ball
' club which beat the Cards 3-2 last
j Tuesday with a first-inning home
' run.
; Tomorrow, with Stan Anderson in
j the pitchers' box, Harry Wolters'
j nine should end the season with a
j win. Anderson has pitched some air
tight ball during the past season
j and may be counted on to tame the
' Gaels, besides getting his usual
I number of clouts at the plate.
Wilson Heavy Hitter
There is one Gael slugger Ander
i son may not be able to keep of! the
I bases, judging by Tuesday's game.
: "Ice-house" Wilson, who spends his
falls as a backfieid threat on Slip
Madigan's Gallopping Gaels and
j who looms mightily in the left-field
garden during the ball season, hit
two for four, one the homer and the
other good for two bases.
Wilson's four-base swat was the
one poor play in the field made by
the Indians during the eight inn
i ings, contrast to the several ball
| games which have been chucked by
) sloppy work in the infield. Instead
j of playing back for the St. Mary's
j heavy hitters, the outfield moved up
with the result that the hit that
1 should have been good for two bases
I went for a home run.
i The Stanford infield, which seems
| to have finally settled down during
j the past few games, may be altered
j slightly tomorrow due to the sinus
| trouble that has kept Eddie Gal
braith out of condition during the
past couple of days. The keystone
sack seerns to be a hard spot to fill
| this year, since Wolter had already
used Jim Wooley, Bob Grayson, and
Ed Clark before Galbraith got his
chance.

Much of the new life of the in
field has been supplied by Jerry
Trautman, who has recovered from
an early season injury enough to

the plate, but his flashy infield play

consistently.

Ti aid man Flashes
Much of the new life of the in
field has been supplied by Jerry
Trautman, who has recovered from
an early season injury enough to
handle third base during the past
few weeks. Trautman has not been
having particularly much luck .at.
the plate, but his flashy infield play
has kept the Cards out of trouble
consistently.
The starting line-ups:
Stanford varsity—Hearn lb, Nut
ting cf, Hamilton If, Miles rf, Gal
braith, 2b, Trautman, 3b, Tremaine
ss, Massey c, Anderson p.
St. Mary's varsity—Ewart cf, Har
ris ss, Hanna 2b, Wilson If, Kane lb,
Berardinelli rf, Bareiiles c, Boyd 3b,
pitcher undecided.
Tomorrow afternoon on the sunk
en diamond following the Card-
Fresno track meet the Stanford
baseball varsity closes its 1934 sea
j son with a nine-inning tussle with
I the Gaels, the vastly improved ball
' club which beat the Cards 3-2 last
j Tuesday with a first-inning home
' run.
; Tomorrow, with Stan Anderson in
j the pitchers' box, Harry Wolters'
j nine should end the season with a
j win. Anderson has pitched some air
tight ball during the past season
j and may be counted on to tame the
' Gaels, besides getting his usual
I number of clouts at the plate.
Wilson Heavy Hitter
There is one Gael slugger Ander
i son may not be able to keep of! the
I bases, judging by Tuesday's game.
: "Ice-house" Wilson, who spends his
falls as a backfieid threat on Slip
Madigan's Gallopping Gaels and
j who looms mightily in the left-field
garden during the ball season, hit
two for four, one the homer and the
other good for two bases.
Wilson's four-base swat was the
one poor play in the field made by
the Indians during the eight inn
i ings, contrast to the several ball
| games which have been chucked by
) sloppy work in the infield. Instead
j of playing back for the St. Mary's
