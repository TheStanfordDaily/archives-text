# MONTH OF HARD GRID WORKOUTS STARTS MONDAY
## 
### Warren Breed 
After four weeks of preliminary
football workouts, Coach "Tiny"
Thornhill will .start a month of in
tensive practice Monday, working
out four days a week until May 25,
when a final 60-rninute scrimmage
will be held. Another informal
scrimmage will put the men into ac
tion this afternoon, with practically
all of the 1935 varsity playing.
Monday will see the return of
basebal lets Bones. Hamilton and
Stan Anderson, halfbacks. Anderson |
did not play last year, but will put
in a determined bid for a job next 1
fall, his chief asset being an ability j
to punt 60 and 70 yards. Claude
Callaway, regular tackle and partner
of Bob Reynolds, may also desert
the shot-put circle for the line.
Hamilton in Suit
With Hamilton back in shoulder
pads, the backfieid that starred 1
against U.S.C., U.C., and Columbia i
lust season will again be intact. Bob
Grayson, Frank Alustiza, Buck Van
Dellen, and Hamilton are all eligible |
to play another year, and this quar- .
tet should prove one of the strong- '
est backfields in the history of Stan
ford football. Bob Maentz, who usu
ally started in Van Dellen'.s place, |
also has another year, but the pres
ent probability is that he will not
return to the campus.
Challenging the position ol this j
four, Johnny Reisner, Ray Todd, j
Chuck White, Chuck Ledbetter, and j
Anderson will try to oust the fa- j
vorites for the first-string berth, and !
be ready to fill in with an injury or I
emergency. Reisner especially has
the speed and trickiness to cash into
varsity company, which he has
shown consecutively in high school,
frosh, and rugby play. In rugby it
was his offensive threat that carred
the Cards to a tie for Conference
honors.
Todd Shows Speed
Todd showed flashes of greatness
last year. Once, against the Olym- !
pic Club, he dove into a big pile-up
of linesmen, seemingly was down,
but somehow emerged from the jam
like a cannon ball, and was stopped
on his way to a touchdown only by
a clutching safety man.
White has come right along with
Van' Dellen, playing l-eserve for two
years. He was rugby captain last
year and is one of the hardest work
ers on the squad. Ledbetter is a
crashing type of ball-carrier, and
once beyond the line of scrimmage
is a definite touchdown threat, as it (
takes more than one man to deter |
his 200-pound frame of bone and
muscle from its course.

After four weeks of preliminary
football workouts, Coach "Tiny"
Thornhill will .start a month of in
tensive practice Monday, working
out four days a week until May 25,
when a final 60-rninute scrimmage
will be held. Another informal
scrimmage will put the men into ac
tion this afternoon, with practically
all of the 1935 varsity playing.
Monday will see the return of
basebal lets Bones. Hamilton and
Stan Anderson, halfbacks. Anderson |
did not play last year, but will put
in a determined bid for a job next 1
fall, his chief asset being an ability j
to punt 60 and 70 yards. Claude
Callaway, regular tackle and partner
of Bob Reynolds, may also desert
the shot-put circle for the line.
Hamilton in Suit
With Hamilton back in shoulder
pads, the backfieid that starred 1
against U.S.C., U.C., and Columbia i
lust season will again be intact. Bob
Grayson, Frank Alustiza, Buck Van
Dellen, and Hamilton are all eligible |
to play another year, and this quar- .
tet should prove one of the strong- '
est backfields in the history of Stan
ford football. Bob Maentz, who usu
ally started in Van Dellen'.s place, |
also has another year, but the pres
ent probability is that he will not
return to the campus.
Challenging the position ol this j
four, Johnny Reisner, Ray Todd, j
Chuck White, Chuck Ledbetter, and j
Anderson will try to oust the fa- j
vorites for the first-string berth, and !
be ready to fill in with an injury or I
emergency. Reisner especially has
the speed and trickiness to cash into
varsity company, which he has
shown consecutively in high school,
frosh, and rugby play. In rugby it
was his offensive threat that carred
the Cards to a tie for Conference
honors.
Todd Shows Speed
Todd showed flashes of greatness
last year. Once, against the Olym- !
pic Club, he dove into a big pile-up
of linesmen, seemingly was down,
but somehow emerged from the jam
like a cannon ball, and was stopped
on his way to a touchdown only by
a clutching safety man.
White has come right along with
Van' Dellen, playing l-eserve for two
years. He was rugby captain last
year and is one of the hardest work
ers on the squad. Ledbetter is a
crashing type of ball-carrier, and
once beyond the line of scrimmage
is a definite touchdown threat, as it (
takes more than one man to deter |
his 200-pound frame of bone and
muscle from its course.
