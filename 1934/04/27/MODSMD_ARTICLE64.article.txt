# SECOND STRING POLOISTS DEFEAT OREGON, 9 TO 3
## 
### George Wilson 
Stanford's second string poloists
made up their mind yesterday to
show everybody that they were just
as good as the first string any time,
and proved it by trouncing the vis
iting Oregon State riders 9 to 3.
The northerners proved much
easier foes than expected, particu
larly after their 3 to 2 victory over
California on Wednesday. In spite
of yesterday's one-sided game, a
more even battle is expected in the
second game to be played Saturday,
when the visitors will be more ac
customed to the field and the horses.
Enemark Stars
Bill Enemark was the individual
star of the day, accounting, for four
of the nine Stanford goals, while Cal
Emeis and Acting Captain Frank
Burns each accounted for two, and
Jim Henderson trailed with one
tally. All proved their right to the
reputation gained last quarter in
practice games, and demonstrated
that Captain Gordan develops good
polo players as fast as he can find
horses for them to ride.
Joe Hedgpeth of the visitors
proved to be their best, scoring two
of their three goals, A1 Sewall ac
counting for the other one.
Old Rivalry
The Oregon State team is the only
other R.O.T.C. polo outfit on the
coast besides the local one. An an
nual series between the two teams
has been played for some years,
Stanford having accounted for a
great majority of the victories.
The line-ups for the Saturday
game, which will be played at the
Highway field immediately nftor the
track meet, will probably be the
same as yesterday's, with Enemark
at 1, Emeis at 2, Burns at 3, and
Henderson at back for Stanford;
Withers at 1, Sewell at 2, Hedgpeth
at 3, and Pangle at back for Oregon
State.
