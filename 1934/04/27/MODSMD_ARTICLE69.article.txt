## 
### 
Announcing that the whole adver
tisement is a fraud, Mrs. Irene Spen
ner of the Appointment Service
warned students yesterday not to
reply to the notice in the Daily of
fering employment at the World's
Fair this summer. The information
published was not given out by her
office, she stated, and from a similar
experience last year she is con
vinced that it is merely a graft to
get interested collegians to send in
their money.
Mrs. Spenner recently received a
letter from a man signing himself as
M. B. Johnson which asked that she
post the notice which the Daily pub
lished. Bearing the letterhead of the
World's Fair Employment Bureau, it
corresponded to like letters received
last year from the same M. B. John
son and from an A. B. Sludge.
At that time, while investigating
the positions which the agency

might offer and after having re
ceived no reply from inquiries to the
addresses given, Mrs. Spenner wired
the Chicago Association of Com
merce. A return telegram from them
stated that the concern she men
tioned was in no way connected with
the World's Fair.
Mrs. Spenner states that she hopes
all students, before answering ad
vertisements for positions, will first
verify the offer at her office.
