Elephants
°n the Campus!
Pink Elephants on the ceiling . . .
Grey Elephants in the circus . . . but
far more perplexing . . . White Ele
phants on the Campus!
They're hiding all over the campus.
Most likely you have at least one —
a car, a typewriter, a trunk, or even
an old bird cage. It's a White Ele
phant to you, but to someone else
it may be the sine qua non of happy
existence.
