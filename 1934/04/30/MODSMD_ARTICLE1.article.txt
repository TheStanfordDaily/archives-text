# MEIER HURT AS CARDS DEFEAT FRESNO, 77-53
## Marty, Fresno Captain, Sets New World's Record For High Jump BLACKMAN WINS 440 Fresnan Beats Nimmo By 10 Yards in Half 
### Jack Drown 
Stanford won a track meet from
Fresno State, 76 13-15 to 53 2-15, on
Angell Oval, Saturday, and Walter
Marty, Fresnan captain, set a new
world's record in the high jump, but
more meaningful to Card rooters
was the tragic injury to Stanford's
captain, Gus Meier.
The echo of 2,000 cheers, given for
Marty when he cleared the cross bar
at 6 feet 9V& inches to break his for
mer mark of 6 feet 8 % inches, had
scarcely died away when Captain
Gus met with the accident which
caused those same voices to become
2,000 audible groans.
Meier Leads
The race which was to prove so
tragic to Gus, the 220-yard low
hurdles event, commenced unevent
fully enough. There were only three
starters, the Card's ace, WiLson, and
Ward of Fresno State.
The trio cleared the first hurdle
together, but Meier was leading
slightly over the second and then at
the third, Captain Gus missed his
stride and with his lead foot crashed
into the barrier to fall heavily on his
left arm. Wilson, the Fresnan in the
adjacent lane, attempted to avoid the
prostrate Meier, but failed, thus
sprawling on the cinders beside him.
A moment later Wilson scrambled
to his feet and took up the race, but
Gus lay writhing in pain, his arm
crumpled beneath him.
Breaks Forearm
Officials raced to the scene and a
quick examination by Dr. Fritz Roth
confirmed the pessimists' worst sus
picions. Captain Gus' left forearm
was broken in two places, the bone
protruding painfully through the
flesh.
Soon afterward they carried him
away and with him, it was believed,
went the Card's chances of defeating
the U.S.C. Trojans next Saturday at
Los Angeles.
Meier Big Loss
Meier had been counted upon for
at least six and possibly 10 points in
the hurdle events against El Trojan,
and now with the Card captain miss
ing, it appears that nothing short of
a miracle will prevent Dean Crom
well's boys from defeating Stan
ford's Indians.
It had been but a moment before
Meier's mishap that Captain Marty
of Fresno State gyrated his slim fig
ure over the cross bar at the height
of 6 feet 9i/ 8 inches. He scaled it on
his third attempt, his first two being
bare failures.
Marty Beats Record
The necessary A.A.U. moguls were
present, so there is little doubt but
what Marty's leap will be recognized
us official when the proper tribunals
get around to it. The new high bet
ters by half an inch the former mark
set by the same Marty last year in
the Fresno relays. Marty later at
tempted to jump 6 feet lO'/s inches,
but Gus' catastrophe had apparently
unnerved him as much as it had the
rest; he missed, although each was
quite close.
With Captain Meier out for the
remainder of the season, the heavy
duty in the highs and lows will fall
to Sam. Klopstock, brilliant soph
competitor, who did not run Satur
day because of a slight case of "flu."
Even Hunt Kingsbury, making a
comeback after being out of com
mission the first part of the season
with a leg injury, suffered a re
occurence and was forced to leave
the track after taking a good second
to Meier in the 120-yard highs. So
Sam appears to be all alone in both
barrier races.
Perform Well
Although Gus' injury gave Stan
ford's victory chances against S.C. a
terrific jolt, the performances of
Jimmy Willson in the hundred, A1
Blackman in the 220- and 440-yard
races, and Phil Williams in the
broad jump were very encouraging.
Willson ran the century in the fine
time of 9.8 seconds to defeat Thorns
by a scant foot.
Blackman ran a great 47.8 quarter
to win by four yards from Harris of
the visitors and a 21.6 220 to take the
measure of teammate Thorns by an
inch or so, and Williams leaped 23
feet 8' 2 inches, his best of the sea
son, to take second to Fresno State's
"Pee Wee" Wilson.
The muchly heralded duel between
Chuck Nimmo of Stanford and Elroy
Robinson of Fresno State failed to
materialize when the Fresnan pro
ceeded to run off with a race to de
feat the Card star by 10 yards nj
the fine time of 1:54.1.
