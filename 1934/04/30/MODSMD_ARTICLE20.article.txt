# "Harry", Encina Janitor, Victim of Hit-Run Auto
## 
### 
Harry B. Satomura, known to past
and present residents of Encina Hall
as just Harry, was killed instantly
Saturday night, a victim of a hit
run driver.
Harry, aged 65, was born in Japan
but he had been in this district for
more than 40 years. He served as
houseboy for President Benjamin
Harrison, for David Starr Jordan,
and for Mi's. Stanford. Mrs. Stan
ford left a provision that he should
be employed by the University as
long as he was able.
The Japanese employee has been
a janitor in the hall for many years,
and his appearance there had been
a familiar sight.
Harry had been walking across El
Camino Real at Alta Mesa Road,
one-fourth mile south of Mayfield,
when he was struck by a northbound
auto and instantly killed.
There was no witnesses to the ac
cident, but J. L. Millet, proprietor of

the Alta Mesa Garage, nearby, was
awakened by the sound of the im
pact, and he said that when he ar
rived on the scene Satamura was
dead.
Millet did not see the car, but he
followed it by a trail of water that
dripped out, apparently a result of
the accident. The auto turned off at
Charleston Road and proceeded into
Palo Alto.
Harry had left his bicycle with
some friends south of Mayfield and
had proceeded across the highway to
visit other friends when he was
struck.
His body was taken to the Tinney
Funeral Home in Palo Alto. Services
have been set for 2 o'clock tomor
row afternoon, with cremation to
follow at Alta Mesa Cemetery.
The Japanese janitor was unmar
ried and leaves no known relatives.
California highway patrol officers
are investigating the case.
