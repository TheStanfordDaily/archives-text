# Prof Reviews '33 Congress
## Dr. F. L. Paxon of U.C. Is Speaker Tomorrow 
### 
"The 'Lame Duck' Panic: 1933"
will be the subject of a lecture by
Dr. Frederick L. Paxon, Margaret
Byrne professor of history, Univer
sity of California, tomorrow night
at 7:30 o'clock in the Assembly Hall.
"There is nothing short of war,
except a major panic, that reveals
the capacity of a nation for concerted
action, or the weaknesses that, are
inherent in its political organization."
Crisis Impelled Action
Basing his lecture on this state
ment Dr. Paxon goes on to say that
in the United States the experiences
of the World War brought about for
a few months a new organization
built to face the issue. In 1933 again,
driven by crisis and the threat of
collapse, the United States laid aside
prejudices and political habits to"
confront a danger.
The panic that impelled this action
was like all panics in that its causes
were entangled among the events of
the years preceding it. It was dif
ferent ip the magnitude of its threat;
and different too in that it occurred
at a moment when the government
of the United States was on "dead
center" in a "lame duck" period fol
lowing the rejection of an adminis
tration at the polls.
New Deal Is Rebound
The crisis was real, but there was
no government possessing the au
thority to act. This "lame duck" cri
sis thus passes into history as a
calamity intensified by the struc
tural character of the government of
the United States. And the rebound
into the "New Deal" becomes the
best exhibit we have of American
capacity in an emergency.
Dr. Paxon received his B.S. from
the University of Pennsylvania in
1898, his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1903.
He has held the position of profes
sor of history at the University of
Colorado and the University of
Michigan. He has been Margaret
Byrne professor of history at the
University of California since 1932.
