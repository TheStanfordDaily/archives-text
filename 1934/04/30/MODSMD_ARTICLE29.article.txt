# Ex Committee To Scan, Vote On Document
## Group Will Alter Clauses Which Caused Defeat In Recent Election Clause on Appointment Of Sponsors Eliminated 
### 
To pass on changes the new con
stitutional committee has made in
the proposed A.S.S.U. Constitution,
the Executive Committee will meet
tonight in the Old Union at 7:15.
Ex Committee will take up all the
changes the committee of Frank
Fullenwider, Crompton Bangs, and
Donn Tatum has made in the manu
script since it was defeated by the
voters in a student body election
over two weeks ago.
Clauses Altered
Trying to make the Constitution
more palatable to the voters, the new
group has altered some of the clauses
that caused overwhelming opposition
to form almost overnight.
Some of these changes are: provi
sion for Men's Sponsors eliminated;
executive power of Men's and Wom
en's Councils to enforce Interfrater
nity and Pan Hellenic rules to be
given on request of the lower bodies
only; rotation of Ex Committee
members provided for; number of
names required to petition reduced
from 300 to 150; and automatic re
moval from office in student body on
failure to sustain a C average elim
inated, but C avei'age still required
for candidates running for office.
Debate Changes
Recent changes made by the new
committee as a result of public dis
cussion of the Fullenwider-Bangs-
Tatum Constitution at the Forum
Thursday night that also will have
to face the fire of Ex Committee are:
franchise for voting on candidates to
Men's and Women's Councils ex
tended to freshmen; graduate mem
ber of Ex Committee and student
member of B.A.C. specified as men;
chairmen of Women's Conference, all
members of Women's Council, and
the sponsor of chairman of each dor
mitory unit to be on the committee
for appointing sponsors; Constitu
tional provision for music activities
to be given the name of Music Coun
cil, and Men's Council elections
specified as not according to the
preferential system.
In the present form, provision for
minor sports is left to the by-laws.
The Constitution that passes the
Ex Committee will be the official
"proposed Constitution." It will be
published in the complete edition in
the Daily later this week, and will
be voted on Friday by the student
body.
