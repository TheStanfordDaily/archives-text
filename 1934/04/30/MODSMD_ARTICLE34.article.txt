# HENDERSON SET FREE; WAITING FURTHER QUERY
## Investigation Shows Three Causes Are Possible; No Solution Yet WILBUR REVIEWS CASE Inquest Set for Tomorrow Morning at 10 
### Bob Calkins 
Mystery continued to surround the
circumstances which led to the death
of Peter Jewett, 19-year-old fresh
man found dead Thursday morning
in a car near Lagunita by Dalton
Henderson, who had accompanied
him on a party in San Francisco the
previous night.
Following the investigation con
ducted by San Mateo and Santa
Clara County officials Thursday,
Friday, and Saturday, Henderson
was released after giving lits ac
count of what took place during the
early morning hours preceding Jew
ett's death.
Following his return from Wash
ington yesterday Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur was presented with all thu
facts of the case.
"Boxing Match" Staged
Henderson, Henry Eversole, Tom
Greenough, and William Brownell,
all freshmen, were the Stanford stu
dents who were at the Klondike,
north of Atherton, with Jewett Fri
day morning, and who were said to
have participated in a "friendly"'
boxing match in front of that estab
lishment.
According to Jack Goldthwaite,
bar-keeper at the roadhouse, all five
of the students took beer mugs out
side, which were broken. His testi
mony revealed that the match was
between Greenough and Brownell,
was referred by Eversole, and
watched by Henderson and Jewett.
George Ravjzza, Redwood City li
quor dealer, was brought into the
case by the investigation when it
was learned that he was also in the
Klondike while the students were
there. He maintained, as did Goldth
waithe and Oellerich, that there was
a loud crash outside while the stu
dents were scuffling. This, however,
was denied by the Stanford men.
Not in Fight
No one questioned so far in the in
vestigation saw Jewett fall or being
hit. For this reason, the hemorrhage
found in back of Jewett's left ear,
and minor cuts and abrasions on his
chin, nose, and ears are unexplain
able.
The possibility that Jewett's death
of cerebral hemorrhages was the re
sult of a fall was more remote with
the announcement by Dr. Frederick
Proescher, Santa Clara County path
ologist, who performed an autopsy,
that there was a hemorrhage in back
of both of Jewett's ears instead of
one behind the left ear as previously
announced.
Possible Causes
So far in the investigation, three
explanations of Jewett's death have
been revealed as leads for further
investigation.
1. Jewett fell against a car door
while outside the Klondike with his
companions.
2. He was hit by Goldthwaite's
stick, wielded when the bar-keeper
threw hini and Henderson out fol
lowing a fight between Oellerich and
Henderson.
3. He struck his head against some
thing when the car in which Jewell
and Henderson were driving hit a
telephone pole near the stadium on
their return from the Klondike.
Further developments were un
likely until 10 o'clock Tuesday morn
ing when an inquest will be held at
the coroner's office in Palo Alto.
