# "Forbidden Fruit Is the Sweetest"

The scries of incidents which have affected the Stan
ford campus during the last ten days starting with seu
rrtil surrounding the Masque Hall and ending with the
tragic death of Peter Jewett and its subsequent develop
ments should be a lesson to the Hoard of Trustees, that
august body which can, if it wants to, find more than one
way of interpreting clauses of the University's founding
gran I.
In practically every case, liquor in one of its many
forms has played a part. In most cases, if not all, the
beverage lias been nol double-distilled whisky or 200 proof
alcohol, but plain old ordinary beer.
For some mysterious reason, allegedly that in the
founding grant which says that no intoxicating liquors
can bejkept, carried, or consumed on the campus, the Stan
lord Farm has been closed to the popular amber-colored
fluid. As a result, the Union and its dispensaries have lost
an untold amount of business to off-campus places where
the sale of beer is "tolerated" and the drinking of beer is
enjoyed by students and faculty members as well as
other residents of the Peninsula.
The Union could use that money nicely, particularly in
the Cellar, which was operated at a net loss of $2277.99
during the fiscal year ending August .'it, 1933. Encina Cigar
Store, despite a comfortable volume of business drawn
from the three dormitories in that section of the campus,
showed a profit for the same period of only $1(521.84.
The situation is this: Regardless of stringent regula
tions, the University cannot control the personal activities
of every individual on the campus. If somebody feels that
■t glass (or even two or three glasses) of beer would hit
the spot on some of these nice, warm afternoons, he can
find without much trouble a friend who will be glad to
accompany him to some off-campus resort (if you must)
and sit there in comfort as he serenely quaffs an amount
of lager. Seldom does an individual go pleasure hunting
alone. Ergo, two—not one—sales are lost to the Union and
the income stays below where it should.
While there was official denial of money being the real
reason for the change, public opinion almost from the very
start lias been that the trustees, seeing registration figures
keeping below a figure which insured financial security,
"re-interpreted" the clause which set the number of women
on the Farm. Now the number is building up rapidly. One
thousand co-eds Avill be seen here next fall, and the. num
ber can swell to the new limit of 1945, instead of 500.
That was a financial necessity. So is the beer problem
on the campus. The board is, or should be, fully cognizant
of 11 i<* fact that two-thirds of the Stanford students are
either wholly or partially self-suporting. Many of them
must depend on the Union for their food and not a few
of them for their work.
If the trustees would only "re-interpret" the liquor
phase of the founding grant by recognizing the action of
Congress that .*1.2 per cent beer (3.2 would be a help) is
non-intoxicating, some of the hardest financial nuts could
be easily cracked. And the benefit of easier living condi
tions on the campus probably would serve to destroy some
of these false impressions about Stanford being a "rich
man's University."

on the campus. The board is, or should be, fully cognizant
of 11 i<* fact that two-thirds of the Stanford students are
either wholly or partially self-suporting. Many of them
must depend on the Union for their food and not a few
of them for their work.
If the trustees would only "re-interpret" the liquor
phase of the founding grant by recognizing the action of
Congress that .*1.2 per cent beer (3.2 would be a help) is
non-intoxicating, some of the hardest financial nuts could
be easily cracked. And the benefit of easier living condi
tions on the campus probably would serve to destroy some
of these false impressions about Stanford being a "rich
man's University."
The scries of incidents which have affected the Stan
ford campus during the last ten days starting with seu
rrtil surrounding the Masque Hall and ending with the
tragic death of Peter Jewett and its subsequent develop
ments should be a lesson to the Hoard of Trustees, that
august body which can, if it wants to, find more than one
way of interpreting clauses of the University's founding
gran I.
In practically every case, liquor in one of its many
forms has played a part. In most cases, if not all, the
beverage lias been nol double-distilled whisky or 200 proof
alcohol, but plain old ordinary beer.
For some mysterious reason, allegedly that in the
founding grant which says that no intoxicating liquors
can bejkept, carried, or consumed on the campus, the Stan
lord Farm has been closed to the popular amber-colored
fluid. As a result, the Union and its dispensaries have lost
an untold amount of business to off-campus places where
the sale of beer is "tolerated" and the drinking of beer is
enjoyed by students and faculty members as well as
other residents of the Peninsula.
The Union could use that money nicely, particularly in
the Cellar, which was operated at a net loss of $2277.99
during the fiscal year ending August .'it, 1933. Encina Cigar
Store, despite a comfortable volume of business drawn
from the three dormitories in that section of the campus,
showed a profit for the same period of only $1(521.84.
The situation is this: Regardless of stringent regula
tions, the University cannot control the personal activities
of every individual on the campus. If somebody feels that
■t glass (or even two or three glasses) of beer would hit
the spot on some of these nice, warm afternoons, he can
find without much trouble a friend who will be glad to
accompany him to some off-campus resort (if you must)
and sit there in comfort as he serenely quaffs an amount
of lager. Seldom does an individual go pleasure hunting
alone. Ergo, two—not one—sales are lost to the Union and
the income stays below where it should.
While there was official denial of money being the real
reason for the change, public opinion almost from the very
start lias been that the trustees, seeing registration figures
keeping below a figure which insured financial security,
"re-interpreted" the clause which set the number of women
on the Farm. Now the number is building up rapidly. One
thousand co-eds Avill be seen here next fall, and the. num
ber can swell to the new limit of 1945, instead of 500.
That was a financial necessity. So is the beer problem
on the campus. The board is, or should be, fully cognizant
of 11 i<* fact that two-thirds of the Stanford students are
either wholly or partially self-suporting. Many of them
