## Putting the Brakes on Prosperity 
### CROMPTON BANGS Jr 
The Wilt fiasco has blown over.
There is no danger of Communism
in the New Deal. There is a very
real danger that the New Deal is a
mass of conflicting policies. The re
sult of this conflict is to retard pros
perity and cause a growing demand
in Congress for more and more in
flation—of the dangerous kind.
This great pressure in Congress is
remarkable when we remember that
the dollar has been cut to 60 cents,
and billions are being pumped out
of the treasury into millions of pock
ets. Besides the U.S. is going rapidly
into the banking business to make
more credit for the "little fellow."
Why Is Inflation Wanted?
In spite of these obviously infla
tionary measures, the demand for
more and more inflation is getting
stronger every day. It will take aii
of F.R.'s skill and prestige to stem
the tide.
At the same time, England, Can
ada, and Australia have been going
through just the same kind of infla
tion we ore now having. But there
is no great movement in those coun
tries for bigger and better inflation.
Why?
Neutralizing Inflation
The reason for this situation is
that these countries have let infla
tion produce its natural results—
more business and more prosperity.
There has been no unnecessary tam
pering with business.
But in the U.S. the government

! has been steadily putting the brakes
on returning prosperity by neutra
, lizing the effects of inflation in at
least three v/ays: (1) Too much
NRA; (2) too much monopoly; (3)
I too little investment.
In the first place, the highly bally
hooed NRA blanket codes of last
1 summer increased industrial costs
before business was good enough to
stand the strain. This hurt small
| business, helped big business, but
hurt business as a whole. It nat
i urally retarded re-employment.
| Then monopoly was given a boost,
i This boosted most prices and nulli-
I fied what wage increases there had
i been. In spite of higher farm prices,
farmers were still in as big a rut as
! ever.
Finally the Securities Act has
hiocked investment of money in
industry to create a demand for
goods and labor. Until this happens,
i prosperity will be delayed.
What Does It Mean?
\ Naturally these three things are
deflationary — not inflationary. The
result has been a jerky and one
sided recovery. This has resulted in
pressure being put on Congress for
more inflation. This would be dan
gerous. The thing to do is to let the
i present inflation work itself out. The
way to do this is to remove the three
brakes on prosperity. If F.R. does
not do this, the demand for more in
flation will grow a.s recovery is held
back.
