# THINGS ABOUT US
## BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 
### BOB LETTS 
Maybe it's an unrealized desire to
write a column, but whatever it is,
this column will appear every now
and then with tid-bits of thought
and news concerning the campus.
Ideas expressed here are to be in
terpreted as tie-ins with the edito
rial policy of the Daily, inasmuch
as our oft-maligned constitution
makes the editor responsible for the
news content of the paper. So, if
you like to write your objections
and address them to me, I'll be glad
to get into a controversy. Please sign
your name.
