# JUST TO START AN ARGUMENT
## 
### 
The Daily purposely overlooked
what now appears to be one of the
greatest objections to the proposed
constitution which was defeated
overwhelmingly two weeks ago. The
item, trivial as it is, was the one
placing the enforcement of rulings
by the Interfraternity Council and
Panhellenic in the hands of the
Men's and Women's Councils. The
houses objected strongly and have
taken credit for the defeat of the
constitution, which may be true.
But why the objection? If the
Greeks are sincerely desirous of en
forcing their regulations, why
shouldn't they place their problems
in the hands of a body elected by the
campus at large? Or do they prefer
to have the clamps tightened only
when there is a particularly obvious
breaking of the rules?
"An organ which plays only half
a tune is no organ at all."
