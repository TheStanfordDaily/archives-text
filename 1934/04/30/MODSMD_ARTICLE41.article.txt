# LOCKOUT RULES ARE CHILDISH

### 
ARE CHILDISH
Here's a self-explanatory letter
which was sent to the Daily for the
Campus Opinion column. Inasmuch
as it wasn't signed and is no good,
we're passing it on:
"We suggest that as a complimen
tary gesture to the Women's Coun
cil and a move to uphold the equal
ity of the sexes, the Men's Council
promulgate rules to punish all men
who
I—Fail to wear pajamas in bed.
2—Swallow without chewing their
food.
2—Fail to write home once a v/eek.
4—Are late to breakfast.
s—Walk with their hands in their
pockets.
6 —Wear a stubborn expression.
7—Fail to salute Council members
and say "Sir."
For these insidious crimes we pro
pose the following punishments:
Standing the culprit in the corner;
secondly, sending him to bed with
out his supper; thirdly, locking him
in his room.
Helpfully,
Encina Reform League."
