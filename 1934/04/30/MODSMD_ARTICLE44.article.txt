GEORGE BARNWELL (Lillo, 17:11)
Little Theatre, Thursday, 2(ith
The question of how far a melo
dramatic revival can be accounted
successful was decided at the Little
Theatre last Thursday with a deal of
skill on the part of both director
(Dr. Merrell Clubb) and play-read
ers.
George Barnwell, sermon from the
18th Century London Mount, came
to us in modified form; and, with
out losing the original idiom, it did
not suffer from lagging tempo or
overplayed gesture. The rhetorical
passages were neatly trimmed and
presented with just enough empha
sis to make them seem sincere,
though burlesque. Of action there
was much, thanks to the sterling
performance of Robert Brauns, who,
as the quavering hero, interpreted
his part admirably. His display of
struggling emotion found most ade
quate aggravation in the wiles of his
fair partner, played by Marian Jones.
But best of all was the scene ol
the murder, in which Curt Zimansky
played the part of stained-glass-cut
Uncle with consummate skill. Even
18th Century apprentices might have
puzzled a bit, however, at the ar
bitrary handling of the murdered
uncle's head; though they would
probably have accepted it finally in
due sincerity.
In a play so well cast as this, it is
surprising that anyone Should have
stood out. Thomas Seller's basso
profundo, effectively catchy in the
sentimental prison scene, must be
given notice. Like the maid in Romeo
and Juliet, the part of Lucy con
tributed much to the dramatic asides,
and Mary Wheeler acquitted herself
admirably in it. Another newcomer,
Marjorie Melczer, as the chaste but
feeling Maria, showed promise; and
William Knapp, as Trueman, gave
his usual good performance.

WONDER BAR (Warner's)
AI the Stanford Theatre
Good songs, a fine cast, and a dif
ferent if not exceptional plot, might
have made this an outstanding pic

lure, a musical comedy to end all
musical comedies of the present,
cycle. Instead, poor dialogue and
slow tempo make it an entertaining,
but mediocre production.
Its greatest fault lies with the di
rector, who has drawn out and elab
orated on his dance routines until
they become tedious and boring.
When Dick Powell, in the number
"Waltz Amoreuse" sings the words
"Why can't this go on forever?" the
audience is almost afraid that it will.
The gags are terrible. Sample: A1
Jolson, in a wearisome scene with a
Russian, produces this masterpiece:
"Did he have pneumonia? No, much
worse. No mon'ya."
Best part of the whole production
is the number "Goin' to Heaven on
a Mule." Jolson, always good in
black-face roles, a little pickaninny,
and numerous colored saints and
angels, redeem the picture in this

amusing grand finale.
The songs are good throughout,
and Dolores" Del Rio and Ricardo
Cortez, as the dance team, earn hon
ors. Kay Francis has a part too
small for her to give her usual fine
performance. —B. Sweet
