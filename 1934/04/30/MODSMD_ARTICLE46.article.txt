# MORE LOCK-OUT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
As an acquaintance of numerous
| sinners chastised by the Women's
Council, I sympathize with the gen
• eral feeling of dissatisfaction with
I the behavior of the Council members
|on the lock-out cases. Such kinder-
I garten penalties as social probation,
| forbidding the victim to communi
cate with any member of the male
j gender for two weeks, say, strike me
I as being too nauseously adolescent
jto tolerate further infliction on
| women capable of marriage and
j children and qualified to cast votes
1 on national affairs.
Apparently tracing the root of evil
|to too much male companionship,
! the Women's Council by its applica-
I tion of social pro seems to believe in
1 making the punishment fit the crime.
Far from condemning this idea, I so
! heartily favor it that I advocate ap
' plying it to the Council members
j themselves, and for their medieval
I nonsense would sentence them to the
I medieval punishment of ducking in
| the Scold's chair. —V. R. Breitner
