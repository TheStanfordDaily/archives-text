You have one day left to live upon '
this earth. You are in perfect health,
but when the sun goes down you
must die. It is so decreed. It is in
evitable, unescapeable. What would ,
you do between the rising and the
setting of that fatal sun?
Most people would spend the ,
fleeting, precious hours in physical j
pleasure. That is natural. There can
be no social reproach that means
anything; the body is satisfied, the
mind is relieved, the soul will take 1
care of itself. What more is there to
wish for?
That immediate physical pleasure
must be sought because it is imme
diate. It is too late to plan for the i
future; it is idle to think of future '
pleasure or happiness. The inse- j
curity is the only thing that is secure.
When the sun sets, anything might |
happen. So the immediate joys, and ;
consequently the basic joys, must be
sought. That is natural, right, and
sound.
But, say you, that is all very true,
but still very foolish. I will never be
faced with such an inevitability. !
Why think of the matter? Every
one knows what happens to people j
who try to cross bridges before they i
are built.
True it is that none of us face the
immediate prospect of loss of life—
at least not that we can count on.
But most of us do face a like inse
curity—that we can count on. When
the sun sets on the peace of college t

life, anything might happen. We will
join the rest of the mob in its one
constant state—the state of flux. We
will be somewhat different. As we
vink into that vast sea, we will clutch
m our hands a diploma. But the man
in that sea, who clutches a stout log
will undoubtedly be better off.
What will we do? Will we lay out
long courses of study ior ourselves?
Will we concentrate on philosophy,
Shakespeare, or others of the mas
ters? Will we attempt to carry out
social research —a la the scientific
method about which we have heard?
Probably not. That all takes time.
There are other joys which are more
immediately satisfying. V/e will grab
at cheap movies, silly parties, bally
hoo, and the Saturday Evening Post.
Each of these is beyond social re
proach, partially satisfies the body,
completely relieves the mind, and
certainly leaves the soul to shift for
itself.
What the future holds, we do not
know. But we will know that the
present holds no promise of future
security. To escape the gloom, we
will join with the mob in seeking the
immediate pleasures.
