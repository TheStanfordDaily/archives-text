With the L'.S.C. meet the focal
point for 191J3 track season the Cards
were given just a hare chance of
squeezing through with a victory by
the smallest margins. Pre-meet
dopesters gave them every break on
the colculations and by figuring
every man at top performance it was
decided that Stanford might topple
the mighty Trojan from his perch
above the national track world.
But every man had to perform at.
the peak of his ability for the In
dians to win, and a month before
the meet Captain Bon Eastman,
counted on for 10 points and a lap
in the relay, pulled up lame and was
out for the remainder of the season.
Smart dopesters immediately pre
dicted another easy Trojan victory,
but the Stanford tracksters, with
Eastman out, instead of performing
at their peak, went clear over their
peak in many cases and Zaches, Wil
liams, Schween, Hables, and Mott
rarn were heralded as the men whose
unexpected points had pulled the In
dians through for their first victory
in years over the mighty Trojan.
