# SIMILAR SITUATION THIS YEAR
## 
### 
Nov/ with the Big Meet safely past
and in the bag, the Cardinals were
pointing for the meeting with U.S.C.
next Saturday in Los Angeles, and
track experts were again saying ilict
Stanford might win if every man
could come through with a top per
formance. They were saying that
until Saturday afternoon when Cap
tain Gus Meier hit the third hurdle
in the 220 lows in the Fresno State
meet and fell, shattering his arm
and, so they say, shattering Stan
ford's hopes of another victory over
Southern California.
Meier's injury apparently knocks
at least six and possibly 10 points
right off the big end of the Stanford
score which should be plenty to hand
a victory to U.S.C. But that's what
they said last year and the Indians
picked up enough extra points to win
the meet.
A splendid crop of come-througli
athletes have already been produced
this year in the Big Meet but their
list may be added to after next Sat
urday. Jimmy Willson looks as
though he had really come into his
own again and may be able to break
up the Trojan sprint monopoly along
with Carl Thorns.
