# CARDS STILL STRONG IN HURDLES
## 
### 
Sam Klopstock's performance
against California was more a prov- J
ing of himself than anything else,
but Stanford has another hurdler in
Hunt Kingsbury who may break
into the picture if he can shake the
kink out of his leg which has been
bothering him all season and which
he aggravated again Saturday. Last
year he and Klopstock as freshmen
were counted as just about on a par.
The men who came through
against California a week ago to
pile up an unexpectedly large score
may he ithlc to do the same thing
next Saturday. There may be some
more points under covrfr out there
at Angell Field, too, that nobody
knows about yet, just as there were
last year. Anyway, after the Stan
ford 1 victory and the Big Meet
this year, it's too soon now to start
wearing black for the Indians.
