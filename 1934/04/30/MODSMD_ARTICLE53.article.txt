# Batsmen Trim Gaels, 19-1
## ANDERSON STRIKES OUT TEN MORAGAN BAITERS FOR WIN Gaels Get Run in Seventh Due to Card Error 
### 
Coach Harry Wolter's 1934 Card
varsity ended a fair season Saturday
afternoon by clouting the offerings
of four Gael ehuckers all over the
Sunken Diamond, by playing a Light
fielding game, and by claiming their
most one-sided win ol the year, a
19-1 win over the St. Mary's varsity.
The Cards made known their in
tention of winning the ball game
early in Ihe fray, when they knocked
Bill Codec, the hurler who held
Stanford to five hits and three runs ;
Tuesday, out of the box in the first
and kept up the same pace on the re
lief hurler, Stetson. When the side
v/as finally retired in the first inning
the Cards had sent nine runs across j
the plate and, with Stan Anderson I
pitching one of his best games, had j
the ball game as good as won.
Anderson struck out 10 Gael bat- ,
ters and allowed only three hits. The j
one run scored by the Gaels, by Jim :
Kane in the seventh inning, was due \
to an error.
"Everybody hits" is a slogan often :
used by ali ball clubs, but the Cards |
made good on that boast Saturday, (
with all but Anderson getting a
single. Jerry Trautman, playing at j
third in his last game, got four j
singles which drove in four runs and j
scored three tallies himself to lead j
ihe Indian batters. Mort Nutting, [
also a senior, hit three singles, scored ,
three runs, and drove in three more j
to follow Trautman, while Dick ,
Miles, Gordon Mallatratt, Frank Tre
maine, and Jim Massey also had big
days at the plate.

Coach Harry Wolter's 1934 Card
varsity ended a fair season Saturday
afternoon by clouting the offerings
of four Gael ehuckers all over the
Sunken Diamond, by playing a Light
fielding game, and by claiming their
most one-sided win ol the year, a
19-1 win over the St. Mary's varsity.
The Cards made known their in
tention of winning the ball game
early in Ihe fray, when they knocked
Bill Codec, the hurler who held
Stanford to five hits and three runs ;
Tuesday, out of the box in the first
and kept up the same pace on the re
lief hurler, Stetson. When the side
v/as finally retired in the first inning
the Cards had sent nine runs across j
the plate and, with Stan Anderson I
pitching one of his best games, had j
the ball game as good as won.
Anderson struck out 10 Gael bat- ,
ters and allowed only three hits. The j
one run scored by the Gaels, by Jim :
Kane in the seventh inning, was due \
to an error.
"Everybody hits" is a slogan often :
used by ali ball clubs, but the Cards |
made good on that boast Saturday, (
with all but Anderson getting a
single. Jerry Trautman, playing at j
third in his last game, got four j
singles which drove in four runs and j
scored three tallies himself to lead j
ihe Indian batters. Mort Nutting, [
also a senior, hit three singles, scored ,
three runs, and drove in three more j
to follow Trautman, while Dick ,
Miles, Gordon Mallatratt, Frank Tre

Coach Harry Wolter's 1934 Card
varsity ended a fair season Saturday
afternoon by clouting the offerings
of four Gael ehuckers all over the
Sunken Diamond, by playing a Light
fielding game, and by claiming their
most one-sided win ol the year, a
19-1 win over the St. Mary's varsity.
The Cards made known their in
tention of winning the ball game
early in Ihe fray, when they knocked
Bill Codec, the hurler who held
Stanford to five hits and three runs ;
Tuesday, out of the box in the first
and kept up the same pace on the re
lief hurler, Stetson. When the side
v/as finally retired in the first inning
the Cards had sent nine runs across j
the plate and, with Stan Anderson I
pitching one of his best games, had j
the ball game as good as won.
Anderson struck out 10 Gael bat- ,
ters and allowed only three hits. The j
one run scored by the Gaels, by Jim :
Kane in the seventh inning, was due \
to an error.
"Everybody hits" is a slogan often :
used by ali ball clubs, but the Cards |
made good on that boast Saturday, (
with all but Anderson getting a
single. Jerry Trautman, playing at j
third in his last game, got four j
singles which drove in four runs and j
scored three tallies himself to lead j
ihe Indian batters. Mort Nutting, [
also a senior, hit three singles, scored ,
three runs, and drove in three more j
to follow Trautman, while Dick ,
Miles, Gordon Mallatratt, Frank Tre
maine, and Jim Massey also had big
days at the plate.
