# POLO RESERVES WHIP O.S.C. 4-2
## Victory Is Second Straight Of Annual Series 
### 
Stanford second-string poloists'j
handed visiting Oregon State riders i
a second defeat when the two teams
met Saturday afternoon at the High
way Field, the score being 4 to 2.
Although the field was harder and
faster than that played on Thurs
' day, a considerably slower game
took place, with goals being scored
in only three of the six chukkers.
The same four Redshirts who de- |
feated Oregon 9 to 3 in the first en- ;
counter, rode again on Saturday.
Bill Enemark and Frank Burns ;
played the most consistently, each ]
scoring a pair of goals to account for
all the Stanford tallies.
Captain Joe Hedgpeth of the visi
tors and his teammate, Hal Pangle,
divided Oregon's two goals between
them, both breaking loose at times
j to give ihe crowd a thrill or two.
The Oregon Staters represent the
only other polo squad on the Coast
made up of members of the school
R.O.T.C. unit and coached by army
officers. They scheduled an annual
match with Stanford, but have not
won a series for the past five years,
during the time Captain Gordan has
been coaching here.

games were: Oregon State —Lewis
Withers, one; A1 Sewell, two; Joe
Hedgpeth (C), three; and Hal Pan
gle, back. Stanford —Bill Enemark,
i one; Cal Emeis, two; Frank Burns,
' three; and Jim Henderson, back.
Referees: Lupe Luppen and Ed

Friday, when they meet Will Tevis'
