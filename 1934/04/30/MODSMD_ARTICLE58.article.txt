# ALL-UNIVERSITY GOLF TOURNAMENT OPEN TO FACULTY AND STUDENTS THIS YEAR
## 
### M. Jack Newman 
A full display of Stanford's power
is promised when the qualifying
rounds of the All-University cham
pionship .start at the Stanford golf
course today. All graduate, under
graduate, and faculty members are
eligible for the competition.
The lifting of the bans from *the
graduate school will allow the dis
tinguished graduate golfers of the
past to meet the present Stanford
satellites. In the University still are
two former Stanford golf captains,
Warner Edmonds and Malcolm Mac-
Naughton; Stewart Hawley, North
ern California amateur champion,
is playing the finest golf of his life.
The prospect of a duel between
any of these and the undergraduates
Stewart, Edwards, and Hoerner
makes the tournament important in
any comparison of Stanford's for
mer golfers with the present crop.

Malcolm McNaughton is consid
ered by most observers as the equal
or better of Lawson Little, whobe
Walker Cup activities prevent his
participation in this year's Univer
sity competition. McNaughton re
ceived the greater part of his train
ing in the Northwest and has
defeated such brilliant and well
known golfers as Dr. Willing of
Portland, Frank Dolph, and Don
Mot*. He is also thought to be the
longest driver competing at Stan
lord.
Other ineligibles at the present
time who are expected to make a
bid for the title are Irving Sloto,
long driving U.C.L.A. top-notch man
who transferred here this year; Jack
Young, formerly on the Harvard
prep team; and Verne "Spec" Ste
ward, Southwestern amateur cham
pion for four years straight.
