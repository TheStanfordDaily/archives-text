# A.I.E.E. STAGES ANNUAL MEETING
## Dr. Tibbetts of University of California Gives Prize-Winning Talk on Shortwave Radio 
### 
Electrical and radio engineers from all over Northern California toured
Stiuiford's various laboratories Friday afternoon as guests of the Stanford
Branch of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. The occasion was
the annual joint meeting of the San Francisco Section and the Stanford,
Santa Clara and California Branches of the A.I.E.E. Also present were
members of the San Francisco Section of the Institute of Radio Engineers.
At 6:15 o'clock a banquet in the Union dining room honored Professor
Sorenson of Cal-Tech., Coast vice-president of the A.1.E.E., who afterward
addressed the members on Institute affairs.

High light of the day was the eve
ning session in the Women's Club
house following the banquet. A talk
was presented by a student from
each of the universities whose
branches attended. To the best went
a year's membership in the Institute,
a gift of the San Francisco Section.
The prize-winning talk was that
of D. R. Tibbetts, of the University
of California. Tibbetts told of the
"San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge
Construction Radio-Telephone Sys
tem". It is the ultra-short wave
communication system which he set
up for the various bay bridge con
tractors to give communication be
tween all piers and mobile equip
ment, boats, barges, etc.
The system operates on four chan
nels between four and seven meters,
licensed by the Federal Radio Com
mission. The sets are small, a cab
inet 12 by 8 inches containing both
transmitter and receiver. Because
the sets were to be used by non
technical operators, it was necessary
to make them extremely simple,
even at the sacrifice of technical effi
ciency. Even so, Tibbetts cited the
case of the laborer who wanted to
talk back to the loudspeaker rather
than use the handset telephone pro
vided.
All operators are licensed, al
though Tibbetts admitted they were
coached with a list of probable ques
tions, "very probable".
When it came turn to license Bill
Read, head diver in charge of sub
marine operations, he read the reg
ulations, then looked up.
"Is this right," he asked, "no pro
fane language?"
"That's right," Tibbetts answered.
"Those are the regulations."
"How the hell do they expect me
to build a bridge that way!" Read
exploded.
