# Toyon Dance Sale Begins
## Convalescent Home Drive Gets All Surplus 
### 
Since the campus has decided to
put over charity in a big way for the
Convalescent Home, next Friday's
Toyon Informal has joined the ranks.
Chairman Glenn Martineau has
decided to open the bid sale to 130
couples, instead of the customary
110. After the expenses of the dance
and budget ai'e met, whatever sur
plus is remaining will be donated to
the Convalescent Home Drive.
This decision was reached by the
committee after it was shown that
the Stanford Junior Auxiliary in San
Francisco is planning a Barn dance
on that same night. The Toyon com
mittee feels that its dance will thus
strive for the same goal—charity—
and at the same time keep Farm
couples on the campus, instead of a
long trek to the city.
The bid sale has been opened, and
the ducats can be obtained from the
A.S.S.U. office, or from the Toyon
committee, consisting of Ed Reems,
John Cotton, Julius Jacobs, Dan
McGettigan, and Bill McCallum. A
tariff of $2.25 will enable guests to
enjoy the spring informal.
Ernie Heckscher and 13 musicians
will play, and a woman's trio, inter
mission brass numbers, and Heck
scher banjo solos arc promised.
Scenic decorations have been or
dered from a Hollywood decorator,
and will arrive on the campus in a
few days.
