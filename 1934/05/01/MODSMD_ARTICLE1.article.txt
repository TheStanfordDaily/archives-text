# PAXON TO TALK ON "LAME DUCK PANIC" TONIGHT
## U.C. Professor To Discuss Depression, Rebound Of New Deal WINS PULITZER PRIZE Historian Says Crises Serve To Unite Country 
### Barbara Sweet 
Dr. Frederick L. Paxon, Margaret
Byrne professor of history at the
University of California, will speak
tonight at 7:30 o'clock in the As
sembly Hall on "The 'Lame Duck'
Panic: 1933."
Stating that only during war or a
major financial panic has this nation
ever united in concerted action, Dr.
Paxon will discuss the stock market
crash of 1929, the resulting depres
sion, and the rebound of the "New
Deal."
Crisis Reveals Faults
The present crisis has revealed
many of the weaknesses inherent in
our political organization, just as
did the World War more than a dec
ade ago. The experiences at that
time brought about for a few months
a new organization built to meet the
issue. In 1933 again, driven by the
threat of collapse, the United States
laid aside political prejudices and
habits to confront a common danger.
The panic that impelled this ac
tion was like all panics in that its
causes were entangled among the
events of the years preceding it. It
was different in the magnitude of its
threat, and in that it occurred at a
moment when the government of the
United States was on "dead center''
in a "lame duck" period following
the reflection of an administration
at the polls.
Authority Lacking
The crisis was real, but there was
no government possessing authority
to act. This "lame duck" crisis,
therefore, was intensified by the
structural character of the govern
ment of the United States. The re
bound into the "New Deal" is the
best exhibit we have of American
capacity in an emergency.
Dr. Paxon, who has been Mar
garet Byrne professor of history at
the University of California since
1932, is the author of numerous
books on historical subjects. His
"History of the American Frontiei'"
was awarded the Pulitzer prize for
1924 as the best work on American
history for that year. His most re
cently published books, "The United
States in Recent Times," 1926, and
"When the West Is Gone," 1929, de
fine his present and special interests.
Since Dr. Paxon has been in Cali
fornia he had addressed the Oakland
Forum, the Commonwealth Club,
and the California Historical Society.

Dr. Frederick L. Paxon, Margaret
Byrne professor of history at the
University of California, will speak
tonight at 7:30 o'clock in the As
sembly Hall on "The 'Lame Duck'
Panic: 1933."
Stating that only during war or a
major financial panic has this nation
ever united in concerted action, Dr.
Paxon will discuss the stock market
crash of 1929, the resulting depres
sion, and the rebound of the "New
Deal."
Crisis Reveals Faults
The present crisis has revealed
many of the weaknesses inherent in
our political organization, just as
did the World War more than a dec
ade ago. The experiences at that
time brought about for a few months
a new organization built to meet the
issue. In 1933 again, driven by the
threat of collapse, the United States
laid aside political prejudices and
habits to confront a common danger.
The panic that impelled this ac
tion was like all panics in that its
causes were entangled among the
events of the years preceding it. It
was different in the magnitude of its
threat, and in that it occurred at a
moment when the government of the
United States was on "dead center''
in a "lame duck" period following
the reflection of an administration
at the polls.
Authority Lacking
The crisis was real, but there was
no government possessing authority
to act. This "lame duck" crisis,
therefore, was intensified by the
structural character of the govern
ment of the United States. The re
bound into the "New Deal" is the
best exhibit we have of American
capacity in an emergency.
