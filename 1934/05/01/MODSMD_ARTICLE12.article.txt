# Food, Festivity Feature Annual Charity Brunch
## 
### HELEN GROVER 
Cheer up, famished Stanford maids
and roughs! Bean Day, which is ap
proaching with its attendant lettuce
and melba toast, has more than a
joyous side. Picture, while trying to
keep the plebeian beans on your
knife, a slice of cake, browned to a
crisp, piled with delicious, juicy
strawberries and topped by a dash
of whipped cream. And steaming
coffee to wash the strawberries
down!
This is only one feature of the May
Brunch, which is to be held in the
Union Court, May 7, all day long.
The privilege of eating strawberries
is yours for the nominal sum of 25
cents, and remember, this is for
charity. For those who like pleas
ures of a more illusive quality, the
Brunch will offer entertainment in
the afternoon. There are rumors of
a jolly-up, and that old doer of dra
matics, Katrina Wallingford, who is
in charge of the afternoon's fun,
merely smiles secretively and bur
bles such words as "orchestra," "cab
aret," and "singing." It sounds good.
This will be the tenth May Brunch,
but the first one that the "Y" has
given with the Convalescent Home

' or any other organization. It was 10
years ago that Mrs. Ben Allen, then
secretary of the "Y" and now assist
ant dean at Mills College, originated
the idea. The Brunch has always
been held on May Day before, which
suggested strawberries to Mrs. Allen
since they are the fruit of spring and.
in season at the time.
Although there have been May
Brunches before, never have they
offered so much for the pittance
charged. At first, the strawberries
were served only until 12 o'clock.
Then, as the demand for the delec
table fruit increased, the time was
extended until 1 o'clock and last
year the Brunch continued until 5:130
, o'clock with the added inducement
of entertainment, which was a novel
innovation. This year it promises to
be an unprecedented event in the
history of May Brunches. Never be
fore has the whole campus taken
part in it. and formerly only Roble
maidens served.
So after disconsolately downing
your lettuce, come satiate that
empty gap in the solar plexus, you
gourmets, and fill your ears with
music. You may cat to your heart s
i (pardon, stomach's) content.
