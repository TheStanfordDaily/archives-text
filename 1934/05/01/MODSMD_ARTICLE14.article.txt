### 
President Ray Lyman Wilbur will j
report the results of his recent trip |
East to the meeting of the Stanford !
Board of Trustees in San Francisco
Thursday.
During the President's three-week
absence he held many conferences
with various Eastern educational j
leaders, addressed meetings of Stan- |
ford alumni in Denver and New
York, and attended meetings of the
General Education Board, Better j
Homes of America League, and the j
Rockefeller Foundation.
Dr. Wilbur is one of the 15 trustees ;
of the Rockefeller board. An ac- |
count of business transacted during J
their meeting will form the major ,
portion of his report to the Stanford
trustees.
One hundred alumni attended a
meeting in New York. There were
50 at an alumni meeting in Denver.
Dr. Wilbur says that the alumni
showed more interest in the graduate |
and university activities than in ath- i
letics this year.
As president of the Better Homes
of America League, he awarded the ;
prize in a national contest conducted
by the league in a radio speech from j
the Rockefeller Center, April 12.
