# Legends of May Day Customs Told
## 
### 
If you chanced to see the usually
sedate young ladies of Stanford
sneaking stealthily forth in the dark
of this morning, be reassured that it
was just an old May custom.
The legend goes that any maid who
washes her face in the dew on May
Day before the sun has risen will
become beautiful, or if she is already
a possessor of that much-sought at
tribute, she will keep her beauty
forever.
The early rising of the maids be
gan the joyful rustic holiday, known
as May Day, which has lost its place
as one of the most loved of the old
festivals and has become today a
parade day for Socialists and Social-
Democrats.
