Proving to be a definitely success
ful living group very similar to
type which would be established if
sorority houses were turned over to
the University administration, Mari
posa house on Salvatierra Avenue is
being studied as a test of the pro
posed system to be voted upon by
women students Thursday.
Established last October when ad
ditional accommodations were nec
essary for the extra 300 women, the
house, formerly that of Kappa Sig
ma, has been occupied by a mixed
group of girls with different back
ground and different interests, in
what they describe as "a very con
genial and wholly successful man
ner."
A canvass of the individual mem
bers of the house, reveals there are
cliques, the women admit, but those
having lived in sorority houses be
lieve them to be no more distinct

I than in the Greek letter organiza
tions. The advantage over living
under sorority regulations, is the j
lessening of standardization and the |
granting of more individual freedom,
ilhey say. Others of the group con- I
sider the arbitrary forcing of pledges i
into campus activities a definite acl
i vantage of sorority jurisdiction.
While some praise the agreeable
situation of living with persons of a
general type as in a sorority, others ;
■ strongly profess their approval of j
the valuable training received from ;
living with a heterogenous group.
The necessity of having to go from (
' their own house to the centrally lo
cated dining hall at the Union, com
monly thought of as a distinct nui
i sauce, is considered an agreeable j
plan by the Mariposans. "It gives us
i an opportunity to meet the girls out
side our own living group," they ex-
I plained.
