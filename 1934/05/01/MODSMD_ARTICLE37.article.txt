# EX COMMITTEE MAY HAVE TWO GRAD MEMBERS
## Petition Accepted as A.S.S.U. Constitution Is Prepared For Student Vote Friday; President Gets Only One Vote Under New Plan 
### FRANK ORR 
With changes providing for two graduate members of the Ex Committee
and one member at large, the proposed A.S.S.U. Constitution goes to a
vote Friday.
A petition signed by over 170 students asking a two-vote representation
lor the 700 graduates was presented and accepted, and since the number of

Ex Committee members would have
then been even, the member at large
was provided for to break any pos
sible tie.
The A.S.S.U. president has but one
vote under the new setup. Formerly
he had one extra in case of a tie.
With other changes already ex
plained in the Daily, the re-revised
document will come up for a cam
pus-wide vote Friday, with Election
Board Chairman Joe Chamberlin in
charge. Chamberlin has been acting
chairman since Charlie Karl left the
University, and was appointed per
manently last night.
A plan written by Herb Sanderson
and presented by Gordon Hampton,
providing for activity and not class
basis for Ex Committee election, was
discarded.
As the Ex Committee now stands
on paper, it will consist of one man
and one woman from the three upper
classes, with the addition of two
graduate members.
Decisively eliminated by the Re
vision Committee after the GBO-117
defeat a few weeks ago was the
clause giving Men's and Women's
Councils unlimited jurisdiction in
enforcing regulations of Panhellenic
and the Iriterfraternity Board of
Control. Altered, this clause reads
"when requested."
Publications Council minutes of
yesterday's meeting were rejected.
