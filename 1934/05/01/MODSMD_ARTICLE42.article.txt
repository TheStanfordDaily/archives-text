# Why Not Walk a Few Feet?

lii spite of a lot of talking on the part of everybody
who has agreed that smoking should he taken away from
Hie Quad itself, many "individualists" persist in the habit
of smoking a cigarette between classes and don't even
bother to step off the Quad to do so.
It would seem that, in view of the apparent fact that
the campus does not want the traditional "No Smoking"
ban on the Quad violated, Stanford men and women would
willingly do their share in maintaining their own wishes.
If one Rough sees another about to get some smoke in his
neighbor's eyes without leaving the Quad, it would be very
easy for him to tap the sinner gently on the shoulder and
point the pathway for the next few steps to the side.
Quadrangle Club meets today and has announced in
tentions to create a committee that will devote itself ex
clusively to the furtherance of this idea.
Stanford students seem to have lost sight of the fact
ihat it should not be a duly to be enforced, but rather a
pleasurable habit to step away from the Quad when one
wants to enjoy a cigarette for a moment. Stanford is lucky
to have such a tradition, fortunate to maintain it.
