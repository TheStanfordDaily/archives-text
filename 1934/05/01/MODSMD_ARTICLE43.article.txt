# Action â€” at Last
## 
### 
Theatrically minded Stanford men and women learned
last night that Ex Committee has created a sub-committee
to study the financial status of tlie A.S.S.U. and thereby
learn what has become of the dollar that each registered
student still pays with his $114 per quarter, originally in
tended for the now-paid-for Basketball Pavilion.
There are less than four weeks of action left this quar
ter, and the Daily intends to miss no opportunity in the
concerted move to bring a theatre to the campus. After
months of pounding at the inevitable stone wall, it is good
to see action ahead, at last, and to know how much the
Associated Students can afford to chip in on the projected
theatre.
The Administration is admittedly very favorable to
ward construction at an early date, and student leaders
have advanced several possible means of securing the nec
essary financial arrangements. The only thing that re
mains now is for those interested to push ahead as rapidly
as possible and see that a great deal is accomplished as
soon as possible.
It will be* an interesting point to learn, when the new
committee submits its report next week, if the dollar do
nated to the Union each quarter bv men students can
really be successfully retired within two years. If this is
the case, an income of $7,000 annually will also be ready
at that time to partially defray the expenses of a new
theatre.
Determination and concerted effort will bring to the
Farm ,verv soon, an auditorium worthy of the name "Stan
ford."
