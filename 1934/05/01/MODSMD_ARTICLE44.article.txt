# WHY IT'S NEWS
## End of the Big Japanese News Story 
### CROMPTON BANGS Jr 
The tempest in a teapot about Ja- j
pan's asserted Monroe Doctrine for
Asia is over at last. Yesterday in
London, British Foreign Secretary
Sir John Simon announced that Ja
pan had promised to keep the door
open in China and to observe the
nine-power treaty.
Thus the rumpus which started ,
about JO days ago came to an official
end. The story about grasping Japan i
which the papers played to the limit
was not news. But the newspapers I
wanted to make it front-page stuff.
In doing .so, they jumped the gun.
Ilow News Is Made
The facts of the case were that a
memorandum had been prepared for
ihe Jap Foreign Office which might
say certain things about U.S. and
China, as well as state a Jnp over
lordship in Asia. Alert correspond
ents seized upon this document and
dropped the might. So the story
broke about a week before the Japa
nese government made any official
announcement. In the meanwhile,
the jingo press was shouting "wolf"
and the rest of the press was in a
dither.
When the official announcement
was made, it was very polite and
harmless, merely saying that Japan
promised such and such. News
papers said Nippon had backed
down. This is doubtful. They are
clever diplomats and probably said

exactly what they had planned to
say and no more.
U.S. Keeps Out
The most encouraging thing about
the whole business is that Uncle Sam
kept, his foot out of it. The Stimson
Doctrine, which left us out on a
limb, was apparently disowned by
his own State Department, as well ay
by Ex-President Hoover. F.R. ap
parently took notice and kept quiet.
It all blew over as predicted, and wc
kept our neck in.
As a matter of fact, we have very
little room to talk, whatever Nippon
may do. An American President
shelled Vera Cruz and landed troops
just because Germany had sent one
boatload of guns to Mexico. Japan
can look to us for any precedent on
this.
Chinese Separatism
A few British papers refused to
play up the story, pointing out that
il was not news and why. Manchu
kuo, Mongolia, and Turkestan were
never integral parts of China, being
conquered by the Manchus. It is
only natural that they should sep
arate as soon as a helping hand is
held out to them. Japan helped out
Manchukuo; Russia aided Mongolia
and Turkestan.
Thus that China is falling apart
and Japan is hanging around is not
new: -it i: merely a tendency. After
last week's mixup, the world should
understand and judge accordingly.

The tempest in a teapot about Ja- j
pan's asserted Monroe Doctrine for
Asia is over at last. Yesterday in
London, British Foreign Secretary
Sir John Simon announced that Ja
pan had promised to keep the door
open in China and to observe the
nine-power treaty.
Thus the rumpus which started ,
about JO days ago came to an official
end. The story about grasping Japan i
which the papers played to the limit
was not news. But the newspapers I
wanted to make it front-page stuff.
In doing .so, they jumped the gun.
Ilow News Is Made
The facts of the case were that a
memorandum had been prepared for
ihe Jap Foreign Office which might
say certain things about U.S. and
China, as well as state a Jnp over
lordship in Asia. Alert correspond
ents seized upon this document and
dropped the might. So the story
broke about a week before the Japa
nese government made any official
announcement. In the meanwhile,
the jingo press was shouting "wolf"
and the rest of the press was in a
dither.
When the official announcement
was made, it was very polite and
harmless, merely saying that Japan
promised such and such. News
papers said Nippon had backed
down. This is doubtful. They are
clever diplomats and probably said

exactly what they had planned to
say and no more.
U.S. Keeps Out
The most encouraging thing about
the whole business is that Uncle Sam
kept, his foot out of it. The Stimson
Doctrine, which left us out on a
limb, was apparently disowned by
his own State Department, as well ay
by Ex-President Hoover. F.R. ap
parently took notice and kept quiet.
It all blew over as predicted, and wc
kept our neck in.
As a matter of fact, we have very
little room to talk, whatever Nippon
may do. An American President
shelled Vera Cruz and landed troops
just because Germany had sent one
boatload of guns to Mexico. Japan
can look to us for any precedent on
this.
Chinese Separatism
A few British papers refused to
play up the story, pointing out that
il was not news and why. Manchu
kuo, Mongolia, and Turkestan were
never integral parts of China, being
conquered by the Manchus. It is
only natural that they should sep
arate as soon as a helping hand is
held out to them. Japan helped out
Manchukuo; Russia aided Mongolia
and Turkestan.
Thus that China is falling apart
and Japan is hanging around is not
new: -it i: merely a tendency. After
last week's mixup, the world should
understand and judge accordingly.
