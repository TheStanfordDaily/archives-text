# CAMPUS OPINION
## DOESN'T WANT BEER 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I beg the privilege of differing
with you on the stand you have
taken to encourage the selling of
beer on the campus. You referred to
the recent distasteful incidents of
"the past ten days" as though they
were a result of not having beer dis
pensaries on the campus.
Let us remember that Stanford
was not established to look out fof
those whoo want to frequent bars
surrounding the campus. It is not
a home where agents are employed
to act as guardian angels to those
who might get into trouble off the
campus. Rather, it was founded ior
the purpose of giving opportunity for
character training as well as educa
tional and vocational instruction.
What it can do, therefore, is to
keep its slate clean from the stigma
which unavoidably accompanies the
selling of liquor. Do you think it
would have been more pleasant to
have had the recent tragedy occur
at a campus bar rather than where it
did?
You speak of the Union Cellar be
ing behind financially; how about
the book-store? Why not put a beer
barrel right in front of the main en
trance so that you couldn't help
thinking of beer and its marvelous
financial effects each time you went
in to buy a pencil or text? I think
Stanford can pull through all right
without being turned into a beer
station. No, Mr. Editor, we don't
want beer on the campus.
—Bob Livingston.
The Editor, Sir:
Only a few days have elapsed
since the tragic death of Peter Jew
ett, yet already one hears the case
declared "unsolvable," and notices
a tendency to dismiss the entire af
fair as merely "unfortunate."
But it cannot be overlooked that,
according to medical and circum
stantial evidence, the boy was killed
by a brutal blow, not by a fall. This
and other events indicate that a very
careful examination of this case is
necessary before absolving the bar
tender of the "Klondike"—the only
person known to have wielded a
club that evening. Yet we are told
by one of those involved that this
man could never be convicted, that
the witnesses, being friends of his,
would not testify against him!
Is this possibility to be tolerated?
Out of the mists of confusing and
conflicting evidences that surround
the affair come two obvious facts:
Firstly, that Stanford students, for
their own safety as well as for what
has happened, must outlaw the
"Klondike" and similar wayside re
sorts; and secondly, that Stanford
University must resolve to carry out
the investigation to the bitter end,
until absolutely positive that this
student was not the victim of willful
and brutal assault.
That is the least that can now be
done for Peter Jewett.

would have been more pleasant to
have had the recent tragedy occur
at a campus bar rather than where it
did?
You speak of the Union Cellar be
ing behind financially; how about
the book-store? Why not put a beer
barrel right in front of the main en
trance so that you couldn't help
thinking of beer and its marvelous
financial effects each time you went
in to buy a pencil or text? I think
Stanford can pull through all right
without being turned into a beer
station. No, Mr. Editor, we don't
want beer on the campus.

The Editor, Sir:
Only a few days have elapsed
since the tragic death of Peter Jew
ett, yet already one hears the case
declared "unsolvable," and notices
a tendency to dismiss the entire af
fair as merely "unfortunate."
But it cannot be overlooked that,
according to medical and circum
stantial evidence, the boy was killed
by a brutal blow, not by a fall. This
and other events indicate that a very
careful examination of this case is
necessary before absolving the bar
tender of the "Klondike"—the only
person known to have wielded a
club that evening. Yet we are told
by one of those involved that this
man could never be convicted, that
the witnesses, being friends of his,
would not testify against him!
Is this possibility to be tolerated?
Out of the mists of confusing and
conflicting evidences that surround
the affair come two obvious facts:
Firstly, that Stanford students, for
their own safety as well as for what
has happened, must outlaw the
"Klondike" and similar wayside re
sorts; and secondly, that Stanford
University must resolve to carry out
the investigation to the bitter end,
until absolutely positive that this
student was not the victim of willful
and brutal assault.
That is the least that can now be
done for Peter Jewett.

The Editor, Sir:
I beg the privilege of differing
with you on the stand you have
taken to encourage the selling of
beer on the campus. You referred to
the recent distasteful incidents of
"the past ten days" as though they
were a result of not having beer dis
pensaries on the campus.
Let us remember that Stanford
was not established to look out fof
those whoo want to frequent bars
surrounding the campus. It is not
a home where agents are employed
to act as guardian angels to those
who might get into trouble off the
campus. Rather, it was founded ior
the purpose of giving opportunity for
character training as well as educa
tional and vocational instruction.
What it can do, therefore, is to
keep its slate clean from the stigma
which unavoidably accompanies the
selling of liquor. Do you think it
would have been more pleasant to
have had the recent tragedy occur
at a campus bar rather than where it
did?
