# BULL SESSION
## THE 						CIRCUS IS IN TOWN 
### 
Today is May Day. A number of
years ago, May Day, to us, was the
time when very little and sweet
young girls—robed in the flimiest of
cheesecloths—went skipping merrily
around a Maypole to the tune of
Mendelsohn's "Spring Song." Now,
of course, May Day means riots,
cracked skulls, and official apologies.
Today is May Day, and, Stanford—
uninterested in such stupid things
as labor troubles and "Spring Songs''
—will go to the circus.
In a world of pseudo-sophistication
and intellectual snobbery, the circus
—as an institution—remains consci
ously lowbrow. There have been at
tempts to introduce soup and fish
and movie stars into circus grand
stands; there has been a rather de
termined attempt to substitute
freshly-milled orange juice for pink
lemonade; there have been scattered
cases of public address systems un
der the big top—but still the circus
is pristine, vulgar, and fascinating.
Green Street burlesque shows
were once the stronghold of organ
ized lowbrowism. But Market Street
stole the shows, boxofficed them, and
dignified them. Their crudeness has
developed into mass-vulgarity; and

| even the public is sometimes nau
j seated by the display.
The movies, once good and low
j brow, have not been ballyhooed into
j over-sophistication, have become
| consciously vulgar, and unconsci
■ ously disgusting. The movies make
too wide an appeal: they attract both
j the high brows and the lows, appeal
i to everybody, and satisfy no one.
The circus has never attempted to
! make an intellectual or an artistic
appeal. The calliope still toots and
blares; the sweety odors of candied
| popcorn mingle with the reeking
• sweat and filth of the animals; the
! attendants are still on hand in their
! perpetually stained and tarnished
i gold-braid. Thus it has ever been,
I thus it remains. Thus it attracts its
! yearly mobs.
We view with alarm the constant
| trend toward more and better rings;
I we lament the entrance of the loud
! speaker. But while the seals, the
' clowns, the stickiness, and the stench
' remains—we are for the circus.
i We have not yet received our com
plimentary tickets; we are not one
j of "the little boys who used to carry
water to the elephants."
—Dave Mellinkoff
