"TWO ALONE" (M.G.M.)
Al the Varsity Theatre
The plot of this cinematic fizzle, i
concerning itself with the troubles ;
cf an orphaned pair fighting their
way to the top (and love, of course!) !
is of the modernized show-boat j
"meller - drammcr" variety. But, j
even rural lowan communities (ex
cepting Lor.g Beach) could scarcely j
be expected to swallow this clee- |
mosynary drivel.
The picture, surprisingly, has some
moments. And all of them are Jean !
Parker, who, by a finished perform- ,
ance, is able to give a faint sem
blance of validity to the production.
The scenes in which she discovers,
the true meaning of love, in spite of j
its utter triteness, is invested with a j
tender delicacy which is truly ;
touching.
Arthur Byron, Zazu Pitts, and I
Tom Brown strive valiantly to give 1
sincere portrayals, but arc hampered
by their hackneyed roles. Alto- '
gether, it's an unsatisfactory pro- j
duction, unless you're willing to
watch the performance of one ac
tress.

"MASSACRE" (First National)
This is a problem picture and will
probably interest those who have j
enjoyed the current run of Richard ,
Barthelmess problem pictures. With i
the exception of the interpolation of j
a few entertaining sequences, the j
entire picture has to do with the;
problem of the Indian and his pres- .
ent-day mistreatment on the reser- '
vation.
Naturally, such a plot would en- j
tail much melodramatic action, and j
this is no exception. But, Barthel- i
mess is sincere, Anne Dvorak makes'
a charming Indian maid, and Claire
Dodd an outstanding white one.
If you like problem pictures, to
repeat, this one will probably enter
tain (provided you haven't had to
sit through "Two Alone.").
