With the Intercollegiate Telegra
phic Meet drawing near, Kathleen
Thorburn shoots consistently better,
her best practice shot being 404 this
year. To win a gold medal in the
meet it i.s necessary to make 425, so
it looks like a cinch and perhaps top
place for Thorburn.
A petite Stanford woman took
fourth place from many a huskier
maiden when she competed for the
Pacific Association Championship.
But Kitty Ahrens had more than
usual competition, considering that
the winner, Doris McCloud, swam
the 500 yards freestyle in 7.14.2, two
seconds better than the record she
set last year in the same meet.
GOLF
The first women's golf tournament
is beginning to look like a treasure
hunt. Another cup has just been of
fered for the lowest score in tlie
qualifying rounds by Barbara Beach
Thompson, former W.A.A. president,
So far, Joan Macgowan has the low
est score for the qualifying round
with 96, followed by Mary Louise
Riley, 103; Betty Hinsdale, 108; and
Barbara Young, 10G.
The first match round must be
played by the end of this week,
flights being posted this morning.
ATHLETIC TRENDS
From Miss Gertrude Hawley, act
ing assistant director of physical
education, we learn that many
W.A.A. organizations in the East are
being disbanded, because of the dif
ficulty in getting juniors and seniors
out for competition, and because
interclass competition is supposedly
fostered by the very nature of a
W.A.A. The system used in its place
works so that enrollment in a sport!
and becoming a member of the club
for that sport is the same thing.
The trend, says Miss Hawley, who
has recently returned from the an
nual meeting of the American Physi
cal Education Association in Cleve
land, is toward intercollegiate com- (
petition. Emphasis is not put on
grooming varsity teams nor class j
teams, competing tea m s being
matched by strength.
To many women at Stanford the
abandonment of W.A.A. would be a !
tragedy. Here it is the aim to get the
juniors and seniors out, and foster
interest in athletics, and so far,
W.A.A. has not thought of disband

ATHLETIC TRENDS
From Miss Gertrude Hawley, act
ing assistant director of physical
education, we learn that many
W.A.A. organizations in the East are
being disbanded, because of the dif
ficulty in getting juniors and seniors
out for competition, and because
interclass competition is supposedly
fostered by the very nature of a
W.A.A. The system used in its place
works so that enrollment in a sport!
and becoming a member of the club
for that sport is the same thing.
The trend, says Miss Hawley, who
has recently returned from the an
nual meeting of the American Physi
cal Education Association in Cleve
land, is toward intercollegiate com- (
petition. Emphasis is not put on
grooming varsity teams nor class j
teams, competing tea m s being
matched by strength.
To many women at Stanford the
abandonment of W.A.A. would be a !
tragedy. Here it is the aim to get the
juniors and seniors out, and foster
interest in athletics, and so far,
W.A.A. has not thought of disband

RECORDS
With the Intercollegiate Telegra
phic Meet drawing near, Kathleen
Thorburn shoots consistently better,
her best practice shot being 404 this
year. To win a gold medal in the
meet it i.s necessary to make 425, so
it looks like a cinch and perhaps top
place for Thorburn.
A petite Stanford woman took
fourth place from many a huskier
maiden when she competed for the
Pacific Association Championship.
But Kitty Ahrens had more than
usual competition, considering that
the winner, Doris McCloud, swam
the 500 yards freestyle in 7.14.2, two
seconds better than the record she
set last year in the same meet.
GOLF
The first women's golf tournament
is beginning to look like a treasure
hunt. Another cup has just been of
fered for the lowest score in tlie
qualifying rounds by Barbara Beach
Thompson, former W.A.A. president,
So far, Joan Macgowan has the low
est score for the qualifying round
with 96, followed by Mary Louise
Riley, 103; Betty Hinsdale, 108; and
Barbara Young, 10G.
The first match round must be
played by the end of this week,
