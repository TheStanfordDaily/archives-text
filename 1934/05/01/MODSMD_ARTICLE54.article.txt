# Seniors Favored To Win Interclass Soccer Title
## 
### 
Odds took a decided turn in favor
of the seniors to whip freshman
soccer players last night as interclass
teams prepared for the series of
class games, which starts tomorrow.
Sophomores and juniors will tan
gle tomorrow, and the forsh will
meet the senior team Thursday.
The frosh defense was weakened
considerably as Ed Washburn, cap
tain and mainstay of the fullback
line, was reported out of the series
with a broken wrist. Odds previ
ously had been figured at about even
on this feature match.
