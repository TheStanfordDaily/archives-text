# SPIRITED CARD TRACKMEN DRILL FOR TROJAN MEET
## 
### 
Their war cry, "Win for Gus,''
Coach Dink Templeton's Stanford
Indian track and field stars are
working this week as they have
never labored before in order to be
in the best of shape when they meet
the powerful U.S.C. Trojans next
Saturday at Los Angeles.
Given only an outside chance to
win by dopesters because of the un
fortunate injury to Captain Gus
Meier last Saturday, Stanford track
and field men have taken a vow to
do their utmost to win the coming
contest for their captain.
Kingsbury to Run
One cheery bit of news came to
Templeton last night when it was
learned that Hunt Kingsbury, Stan
ford's- second best hurdler to the
brilliant Klopstock, now that Meier
is gone, would be able to run against
El Trojan.
Kingsbury placed second last Sat
urday to Meier in the 120-yard high
hurdle affair, but cramped a muscle
going over the last barrier and it was
feared that he would be unable to
compete against Troy.
With the great sophomore, Klop
stock, and Kingsbury, also a sopho
more, ready for duty in the obstacle
races, the Cards' hopes are raised
somewhat, but the loss of Captain
Meier will be felt more keenly than
merely the absence of his customary
eight to 10 points in the highs and
lows.
Templeton Worried
While Captain Gus is resting
easily in the Stanford Hospital, his

fractured left arm encased in a cast, ;
Templeton has already foreseen a |
golden opportunity left open to the 1
Trojans for development should
Dean Cromwell, the S.C. mentor,
choose to do so, and the Stanford
coach is puzzling as to how he is
going to prevent such a move.
Naturally it all revolves around
Meier's absence. With the Stanford '
captain out of the low hurdles and
with only two Stanford entrants to
compete, in the persons of Klopstock ;
and Kingsbury, Cromwell could very
profitably remove Ablowich from [
this race and allow the Trojan co
captain to return to his first love, i
the quarter mile. This would give
the southerners Hall and Strothers j
and possibly Norman Paul, if he re
covers from a bothersome leg injury, j
in the lows, a trio capable of taking i
care of itself in any company.
S.C. Cinch in Relay
But to make it tougher for the j
Cards, it would allow Ablowich to ;
compcte in the 440 and to run a lap !
in the relay, where flanked with such i
great performers as McCarthy, Fitch, j
and Tompkins, all capable of 48.4 or j
better, the Southern California cjuar- :
I tet would be practically a cinch to j
defeat any mile relay team that the !
J Indians could put on the field. 1
