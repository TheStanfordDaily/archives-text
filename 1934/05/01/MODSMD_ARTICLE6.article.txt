# Library Makes Indices For Bound Daily Volumes
## 
### 
Through the use of SERA funds,
Stanford Library has been enabled
to prepare indices to volumes 83 and
84 of The Stanford Daily. Miss Alice
N. Hays, reference librarian, each
day makes a cumulative topical in
dex to the Daily.
SERA funds have provided for 60
hours of typing, 30 hours in March
and 30 hours in April, to finish these
indices, a total of $30. The typed
index is then bound inside the bound
copy of the Daily.
