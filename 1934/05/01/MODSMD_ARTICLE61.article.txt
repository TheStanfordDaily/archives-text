# L.A. TANK MEN TO PLAY CARDS
## 
### 
America's most powerful water
I polo aggregation, the Los Angeles
Athletic Club, v/ill invade Encina
pools Friday and Saturday, May 11
and 12, to settle a little matter of the
' Pacific Coast championship with
| Northern California's best, Nort
| Thornton's Stanford Indians,
j Proceeds from the three-game se
j ries will go to the Convalescent
| Home Drive.
The Los Angeles squad, Southern
i California champion, represented the
! United States in the 1932 Olympic
i Games, advanced to the finals and
1 was barely nosed out by the Hun
i garian team for the title.
| The L.A.A.C. team is made up en
| tirely of this American Olympic
j group, and several of the stars are
! still the outstanding aquatic men in
j the country. They are especially
| noted for their ability in working
j together as a team.
The southern squad was formed in
] 1929 from a gi'oup of all-stars from
I various member clubs of the South
i ern California Water Polo League,
j This group practiced together for
three years and had little trouble
winning the Olympic trials.
Last year's Stanford varsity forced
L.A. to four extra periods before the
club men succeeded in taking a 5 lo
4 game. The southerners' record for
| this year includes 18 victories among
which are wins over U.C.L.A. and
U.S.C.
All of which places Thornton's
squad as underdog for ihe first time
1 this year.

j A Beta and a Theta led the Grand
| March of the Purdue Junior Prom.
