# INDIANS PROMISE STRONG BASEBALL TEAM NEXT YEAR
## 
### 
! Saturday's 19-1 win over the St.
j Mary's varsity wound un a baseball
; season for Harry Welter's Card nine
j that was long ago assigned to medi
! ocrity. At the same time it meant
! that the Indian varsity was finally
] outclassing opponents the way it
should and was finally playing the
, ball that Card fans have been wait
| ing for all spring: it looked forward
! to a winning season for 1935.
One of the departments that has
j given Wolter considerable worry
1 during the past spring has been an
! untried pitching staff. Next year ihe
' Indians will start out with lour, in-
I stead of one, experienced pitchers of
J proven ability.
Anderson to Return
I Stan Anderson will be back to
head ihe pitching staff. Although
j Anderson may not have been cred
j ited with many victories in the
I league records, he turned in sev
! eral afternoons of chucking which
i would have won most ball games but
I which went to the opponents because
| of an absence of support. Fred Her
i inger, Johnny Campbell, and Bob
• Semmelroth, with valuable experi
| ence gained during the past season,
| will also be ready for service.
With the exception of Jerry Traut-
I man at third, Wolter will have the
j same infield that played the entire
' last St. Mary's game. Gordy Malla
i tratt will probably handle the first
base duties, as he did during the
1933 season and intermittently ihis
i spring. Eddie Galbraith and Frank
Tremaine, two sophs who took care
of second and short, respectively,
will be back with one year of var
! sity experience.
Infield Strong
In addition, Wolter will have the
use of two infielders lost during the
middle of the past season, Ed Clarke
and Jim Woolley, and Bobby Gray
son, who played first base during
the early season games.
For outfielders there will be Bob
j Hamilton and Jim Moserip, and pos
sibly Mort Nutting may return. From
the frosh ranks will come Mike Fer
ro, catcher, and A1 Brent, outfielder,
two of a dozen that are capable oi'
playing varsity ball.

The University of Wisconsin puts
out a 12-page daily.

! Saturday's 19-1 win over the St.
j Mary's varsity wound un a baseball
; season for Harry Welter's Card nine
j that was long ago assigned to medi
! ocrity. At the same time it meant
! that the Indian varsity was finally
] outclassing opponents the way it
should and was finally playing the
, ball that Card fans have been wait
| ing for all spring: it looked forward
! to a winning season for 1935.
One of the departments that has
j given Wolter considerable worry
1 during the past spring has been an
! untried pitching staff. Next year ihe
' Indians will start out with lour, in-
I stead of one, experienced pitchers of
J proven ability.
Anderson to Return
I Stan Anderson will be back to
head ihe pitching staff. Although
j Anderson may not have been cred
j ited with many victories in the
I league records, he turned in sev
! eral afternoons of chucking which
i would have won most ball games but
I which went to the opponents because
| of an absence of support. Fred Her
i inger, Johnny Campbell, and Bob
• Semmelroth, with valuable experi
| ence gained during the past season,
| will also be ready for service.
With the exception of Jerry Traut-
I man at third, Wolter will have the
j same infield that played the entire
' last St. Mary's game. Gordy Malla
i tratt will probably handle the first
base duties, as he did during the
1933 season and intermittently ihis
i spring. Eddie Galbraith and Frank
Tremaine, two sophs who took care
of second and short, respectively,
will be back with one year of var
! sity experience.
