# Three Cornered Moon Holds Unique Rehearsal
## 
### ELIZABETH CHAPIN 
A group of slightly mad people
rehearsing a hilarious play about
! slightly insane people is something
i to conjure with, and that has been
the order of the night at the As
■ sembly Hall recently, where Harold
; Helvenston's cast is rehearsing
j "Three Cornered Moon," to be pre
sented May 11.
Helvenston, in addition to design
ing the set, has been devising all
manner of strange bits of business in
I keeping with the character of the
| mad Rimplegars.
j The head of the family is played
by Jean Albertson, whose role calls
I for her to spend most of the first act
, with a lofty Turkish towel on her
■ head, amidst taunts from the others.
Mrs. Rimplegar's three sons are
i alike only in that they are seldom
j in one spot for a moment. Rehearsals
I have revealed James Benet in long
; conversations over an imaginary
i telephone, striking various attitudes
j on stairs and furniture.
Shelley Smith in the role of Eliza -
I beth has been straining her vocal
j cords nightly in her second-act hy
| sterics scene, while Joe Chamberlain

1 has been forced to simulate hunger
shortly after dinner every night.
Bob Balzer spends most of Act I
quietly devising a means of com
: mitting suicide, and it is interesting
to watch his pantomine while the
Rimplegars lose all their worldly
I goods.
i The others in the cast —Kay Ar
i thur with her Czech accent, Pete
! Peck as the sensible Dr. Stevens,
| and Neil Berry as the third son —
' contribute more than slightly to the
! general inanity.
