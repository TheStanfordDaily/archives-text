# SOCIAL REGULATION CHANGE CONSIDERED
## 
### 
Written suggestions for changes in
the new women's social regulations,
which were voted on and passed two
weeks ago, are now being asked for
by the Social Regulation Committee
which has been appointed by Wom
en's Conference to consider revision
of these new rules.
Conference feels that there is some
opposition to the regulations as they
stand at present. The idea was to
pass these rules if they were, taken
as a whole, considered superior to
the then existing rules, and then to
revise them in the particular parts
that were objected to. This was con
sidered better than trying to revis'3
the old ones.
Suggestions for the revision should
be handed to Alice Klauber, chair
man, of the Social Regulations Com
mittee, with the next two days.
Members of the committee are
Doris Drury, Iris Forsythe, and Bar
bara Browning.
