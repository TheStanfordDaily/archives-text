### 
• Centralization and unification are
dominant trends in government of
the United States according to Pro- ■
fessor Edwin E. Cottrell, head of j
the Social Science Department at |
Stanford. Speaking to a group of'
governmental and civic committees I
of the Los Angeles Chamber of Com- j
merce, Dr. Cottrell cited significant j
changes in governmental functions
that have taken place in the last sev- '
eral years.
"The federal government is rapid- i
ly usurping state powers," Dr. Cot- j
trell said. "The state is taking over |
the various functions in the county
governments."
Dr. Cottrell will return to Stanford j
October first after completing his j
six months sabbatical leave.
