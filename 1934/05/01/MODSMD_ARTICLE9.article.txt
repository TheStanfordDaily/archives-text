# Local Surgery Head Featured On Radio Hour
## Necessity of Investigating Persistent Ailments Stressed in Talk Self-Analysis Dangerous If Experience Limited 
### 
Any pain that persists, no matter
how slight, should be investigated,
according to Dr. Edmund Butler, as
' sociate clinical professor of surgery
; here and chief of the emergency
staff of the San Francisco Hospital.
Dr. Butler was last night's featured
| speaker on the Stanford University
; Hour, broadcast at 7:45 o'clock from
j radio station KPO.
Many ailments do not have suffi-
I cient symptoms to cause alarm, con
: tinued Dr. Butler, and thus many
| serious conditions may go unsus
; pected until alarming complications
I arise.
j . Names Diseases
Kidney diseases, heart disorders,
j appendicitis, and ulcers of the stom
; ach are among the acute and chronic
diseases which are slow to develop,
he said.
Dr. Butler stated that it is danger-
I ous for any patient to try to diagnose
j his own ailment on the basis of his
! limited experience, and that it is
difficult for any positive rules to be
laid down as to the symptoms which
should be regarded as dangerous.
Symptoms Vary
This situation, he said, is caused
by variation in the way any disorder
presents itself. A particular symp
tom may develop sufficiently in one
person to allow of curative treat
ment, while in another person, even
a member of the same family, that
same symptom may develop too late
for treatment to be effective.
"The normal person is not con
! scious of the presence or working of
the organs of the body," concluded
Dr. Butler. "The occurrence, there
fore, of aching, distress, fullness,
sense of movement, or pain in the
I region of the heart, liver, or stomach
! calls for investigation, particularly
j if these symptoms last for any length
j of time."
