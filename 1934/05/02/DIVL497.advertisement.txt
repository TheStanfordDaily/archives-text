DELICATE COMPLEXION
FACE POWDER
Finely textured, it goeson smoothly,
imparting a sheenless but lasting
Finish. Each shade is a perfect re
production of a living skin tone,
resulting in the invisibility of trie
powder when applied. The new
Lentheric face powder clings with
almost magic permanence and in
spires confidence in a beautifully
natural appearance.
Face Powder $1.10 bo*.
