# PAXON PRAISES LATE ABOLITION OF LAME DUCK
## Foundation of 1929 Panic Laid Before Conflict, Says Savant SPEECH IS INCOMPLETE Crash Is Like Napoleonic Post-War Deflation 
### Helen Warson 
That the "Lame Duck" amendment
ratified in February 1933 eliminated
one of our Constitution's most glar
ing defects was the opinion of Dr.
Frederick L. Paxon, professor of his
tory at the University of California
who spoke last night in the Assembly
Hall on "The 'Lame Duck' Panic:
133:"
Slightly ill, Dr. Paxon was unable
to conclude his lecture, making his
apologies to Mr. Edgar Robinson,
who introduced the speaker, he left
the stage.
Crash Foundations
Criticizing the characteristic
American attitude of regarding de
pressions as "Acts of God," Dr. Pax
on pointed out that the foundation
for the crash of 1929 was laid before
the war.
The condition of the farmer in
1933 is very similar to the pi'edica
ment he faced after the panic of
1819. The farmers had been riding
high on the profit of the Napoleonic
Wars, but with peace came the ces
sation of European trade, and the
consequent market collapse. The
farmer was faced with the problem
of disposing of a vast surplus.
War and Collapse
There is this same situation today.
The World War stimulated the
farmer as had the Napoleonic Wars
in the earlier period. V/ith the great
demand for food, the price of land
and food rose to new heights. The
end of the War meant another col
lapse and another vast unmarketable
surplus.
According to Dr. Paxon, the prob
lem of what to do with the displaced
laborer is one of the most acute ones
with which America is faced. The
steady displacement of men by ma
chines in industry has been partially
obscured by the appearance of new
industries which in the past have
been able to absorb this labor sur
plus. Agriculture is faced by the
same problem. With the increased
efficiency of farm machinery, the
farmer can get along" with less help.
Bank Condition Climax
The magnitude of the panic of 1933
which culminated in the bank
closures, Dr. Paxon accredited to the
fact that it occurred at a moment
when the government of the United
States was on a "dead center" in the
"lame duck" period between elec
tions and the date of inauguration.
The President and Congressmen
were powerless in the face of the
greatest crisis America has ever ex
perienced.

The World War stimulated the
farmer as had the Napoleonic Wars
in the earlier period. V/ith the great
demand for food, the price of land
and food rose to new heights. The
end of the War meant another col
lapse and another vast unmarketable
surplus.
According to Dr. Paxon, the prob
lem of what to do with the displaced
laborer is one of the most acute ones
with which America is faced. The
steady displacement of men by ma
chines in industry has been partially
obscured by the appearance of new
industries which in the past have
been able to absorb this labor sur
plus. Agriculture is faced by the
same problem. With the increased
efficiency of farm machinery, the
farmer can get along" with less help.
Bank Condition Climax
The magnitude of the panic of 1933
which culminated in the bank
closures, Dr. Paxon accredited to the
fact that it occurred at a moment
when the government of the United
States was on a "dead center" in the
"lame duck" period between elec
tions and the date of inauguration.
The President and Congressmen
were powerless in the face of the
greatest crisis America has ever ex
perienced.
That the "Lame Duck" amendment
ratified in February 1933 eliminated
one of our Constitution's most glar
ing defects was the opinion of Dr.
Frederick L. Paxon, professor of his
tory at the University of California
who spoke last night in the Assembly
Hall on "The 'Lame Duck' Panic:
133:"
Slightly ill, Dr. Paxon was unable
to conclude his lecture, making his
apologies to Mr. Edgar Robinson,
who introduced the speaker, he left
the stage.
Crash Foundations
Criticizing the characteristic
American attitude of regarding de
pressions as "Acts of God," Dr. Pax
on pointed out that the foundation
for the crash of 1929 was laid before
the war.
The condition of the farmer in
1933 is very similar to the pi'edica
ment he faced after the panic of
1819. The farmers had been riding
high on the profit of the Napoleonic
Wars, but with peace came the ces
sation of European trade, and the
consequent market collapse. The
farmer was faced with the problem
of disposing of a vast surplus.
War and Collapse
There is this same situation today.
The World War stimulated the
farmer as had the Napoleonic Wars
in the earlier period. V/ith the great
demand for food, the price of land
and food rose to new heights. The
end of the War meant another col
lapse and another vast unmarketable
surplus.
