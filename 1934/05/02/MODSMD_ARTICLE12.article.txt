## Officer Plans to Inspect Whitewashed Stables 
### 
Appearance of glistening new
whitewash around the military sta
bles area and other feverish prep
arations in that vicinity are ex
plained by the arrival on the campus
this morning of Brigadier General
Sherwood A. Cheney to make one of
a series of inspections of the local
R.O.T.C. unit which will play a part
in the determination of the annual
War Department efficiency rating of
the unit.
General Cheney is the command
ing officer of the 9th Coast Artillery
District, which includes the harbor
defences of San Francisco Bay.
The general will visit several of
the theoretical military classes in
session this morning, according to
Major E. C. Williams of the Military
Department, and will witness a drill
and review of the Wednesday drill
section this afternoon in the stable
area. The afternoon demonstration
will consist of a mounted battery
drill. Special blue lappeled blouses
and belts will be worn by the cadets
for the occasion, it was announced.
The Stanford R.O.T.C. has received
an "excellent" efficiency rating,
which is the highest award, every
year since these inspections were in
augurated, Major Williams stated.
