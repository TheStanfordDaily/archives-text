# Helvenston Supervises Plans Of Miniature Model Theatre
## 
### 
Necessities of a modern, fully
equipped stage are being vividly
demonstrated under Dramatic Di
rector Harold Helvenston. by the
construction of a small-scale model,
complete and up-to-date in every
diminutive detail.
Built by technical students under
the supervision of Helvenston. the
project will probably reach comple
tion within three weeks. The fin
ished model will be utilized in clsas
discussions, and put on exhibition
in room 203 for interested drama
tists.
Helvenston's "toy" boasts a high
gridiron, trap areas in the floor, and
ample storage space for scenery. It
shows the possibilities of properly
handled curtains; and possesses a
full-Hedged switchboard, planned to J

demonstrate the ideal relationship
of the board to the stage proper.
The gridiron is equipped with
blocks —in parlance of the layman,
pulleys. The miniature cyclorama ,
is movable to the extent that it can '
be raised above the stage.
A complicated system of lighting,
to supplement the switchboard ar
rangement, has already been per
fected, although it offered one of
the most difficult problems of the !
entire construction.
Wood is the chief material em
ployed. The greater majority of the
components duplicate those of an
actual stage.
