# FINAL CHARTER FACES STUDENT OPINION FRIDAY
## Number of Voting Members On Executive Body Increased to 11 FRESHMAN FRANCHISE Petition Gets New Member For Graduates 
### 
With the number of voting mem-
J hers of Ex Committee increased to
11, the Men's and Women's Councils
1 voting franchise extended to fresh
! men, and with many minor changes
1 from the original revision, the re-re
; revised A.S.S.U. Constitution is
printed on the Daily's back page to
j day.
The Constitution is now in the
final form it will be voted on by
students Friday. Joe Chamberlain,
newly appointed election board
chairman, will supervise the vote.
New Committee
After a consideration of the parts
of the first revision that brought it
into disfavor with the voters, a sec
ond Revision Committee composed
of Frank Fullenwider, Crompton
Bangs, and Donn Tatum, and advised
on the women's provisions by Elinor
Kahn, drafted the second revision
and considered the controversial
points before a group of students
after the Ex Committee meeting last
week.
Draft Revised
Further airing of dissatisfaction
| with the tentative draft, which was
| published in the Daily last Thurs
; day, was considered at an unofficial
| Forum meeting Thursday night.
Students having objections to the
new document ironed out most of tile
difficulties with Fullenwider, revi
sion committeeman present.
Final change in the Constitution
was made at the Ex Committee
: meeting Monday night, where a petl
! tion signed by over 170 students led
: to the granting of two-man repre
sentation on the Ex Committee to
graduates and one member to be
elected at large.
Difliculties Removed
As a result of the "test of fire" the
second draft has received during
the last week and a half, committee
I members feel that the proposed Con
stitution has ironed out most diffi
culties. Members of the revision
group have met some of the opposi
their requests, having explained
tion to the document by acceding to
their point satisfactorily to others,
| have compromised with some, and
I have left few dissatisfied.
