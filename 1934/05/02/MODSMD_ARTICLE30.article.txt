# That Lobby Again
## 
### 
The Union Hoard of Governors recently went oil record j
us ofliciallv sanctioning the use of the I'nion lobby by the
women of I'nion Dormitory. That is what the women I
wanted and it is precisely what the Daily asked for in
several editorials.
The doors from the entrance to the dorm proper into!
\he lobby still remain closed. There isn't, so far as we have ;
been abie to learn, any immediate prospect of their being |
opened.
The women don't exactly relish the idea of becoming]
Irackslers and doing a lit) around the arcades of Union
Court to get into the lobby. The proposition of going all
the svav around the arcades is humorously absurd. It com
pares with locking the front door of your house and always
< ntering via the back porch.
What can be done about it? Members of the Hoard of
(iovernors have indicated their intent to "let the matter
ride" until next September at least. They say that the con
struction of new doors or the alteration of the kitchen at |
the present time is "inconvenient and practically impos
sible." It even has been mentioned that Dean Yost (she's!
in the Hast) would object because the maid service would
have to be increased.
By the construction of a temporary barrier across the
kitchen, the matter could he solved for this spring with!
Jillle expense. Then next fall a truly artistic set of doors,
if that is what is wanted, could be built.
