The campus lias been deluged by now with enough;
"charilv" and pseudo-philanthropic social events to float
(lie entire student body down to Los Angeles on an up-to
date Ark of HKM vintage.
The Daily, remaining TOO per cent behind all worthy
enterprises of the Associated Students, firmly believes that
the lime will never be more ripe than today to start clean
ing up the campus bulletin boards of the cumbersome litter
of posters advertising many and varied off-campus events
purported to have some sort ot "special interest .tor the j
Stanford student.
Either publicity for off-campus affairs which run in
direct competition with organized Stanford entertainment
must stop immediately, or the whole system of date-grant-j
ing bv the Ex Committee remains nothing more than the j
farce it apparently has become in recent days. Stanford j
lias been busy enough supporting otlicial charity drives of
its own creation without bleeding the campus with other I
enterprises in the same guise.
Immediate example of the unhealthy situation comes
to notice in the Tovon spring informal dance scheduled
for Friday evening. Bid sale has fallen considerably short
of expectations, in spite of an unusually good dance prom
ised, merely because a San Francisco hotel saw the chance
to make some extra money by advertising a Friday evening
dance with a certain sum to be given to a local charity.
In the meantime, the Tovon Club affair will suffer, the
campus gains nothing by permitting the condition to con
tinue, and the entire A.S.S.U. plan ot "Back to the rarm
with a build-up of campus activities has gone to pot.
Action, immediate and effective, is necessary. There's
no comparison in the price of an evening's entertainment
for the student who wants to go (lancing Friday, or any
oilier night. Tariff to the city, with gasoline expense, is
inevitably higher.
Why let Stanford men and women be deluded by this
"charity" gag and thus influenced, miss a good time right
here at home? Ex Committee should remedy the situation.
