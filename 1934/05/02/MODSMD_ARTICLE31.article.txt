# Charity or Chisel?
## 
### 
The campus has been deluged by now with enough
"charity" and pseudo-philanthropic social events to float
(lie entire student body down to Los Angeles on an up-to
date Ark of 1934 vintage.
The Daily, remaining 100 per cent behind all worthy
enterprises of the Associated Students, firmly believes that
the lime will never be more ripe than today to start clean
ing up the campus bulletin boards of the cumbersome litter
of posters advertising many and varied off-campus events
purported to have some sort of "special interest" for the
Stanford student.
Either publicity for off-campus affairs which run in
direct competition with organized Stanford entertainment
must stop immediately, or the whole system of date-grant-
ing by the Ex Committee remains nothing more than the
farce it apparently has become in recent days. Stanford
has been busy enough supporting official charity drives of
its own creation without bleeding the campus with other
enterprises in the same guise.
Immediate example of the unhealthy situation comes
to notice in the Toyon spring informal dance scheduled
for Friday evening. Bid sale has fallen considerably short
of expectations, in spite of an unusually good dance prom
ised, merely because a San Francisco hotel saw the chance
to make some extra money by advertising a Friday evening
dance with a certain sum to be given to a local charity.
In the meantime, the Toyon Club affair will suffer, the
campus gains nothing by permitting the condition to con
tinue, and the entire A.S.S.U. plan ft "Back to the Farm"
with a build-up of campus activities has gone to pot.
Action, immediate and effective, is necessary. There's
no comparison in the price of an evening's entertainment
for the student who wants to go dancing Friday, or any
other night. Tariff to the city, with gasoline expense, is
inevitably higher.
Why let Stanford men and women be deluded by this
"charity" gag and thus influenced, miss a good time right
here at home? Ex Committee should remedy the situation.
