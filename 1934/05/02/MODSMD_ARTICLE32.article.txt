# WHY IT'S NEWS
## F.R. Writes a Book 
### CROMPTON BANGS Jr 
When a President of U.S. writes a ]
book, it's news. When President
Roosevelt writes a book, it's real >
news. His book, "On Our Way," has j
lecently appeared. It is a collection
of .speeches during his first year in
office. Thus it contains nothing really '
new, yet we can get a better slant
on F.R. by reading it.
President Roosevelt has been
called a radical; his opponents base
their attacks on his use of the word
"planning." They say Communism,
Fascism, and Planning are all the |
same. By reading F.R.'s book we I
can see that is is not so.
No Drifting
By planning, F.R. does not mean
the Russian Five-Year Plan or the
Italian Corporative State. What he
means by planning is simply to look
ahead and to co-ordinate policies,
not to drift and let things pile up in
a heap. He does not mean that Amer
ican economic life should bo run ac
cording to government schedule. He
means that the government should
!x> alert and ready to do something
before things get very bad.
The exact opposite of the Presi
dent's "philosophy war that, of ex-
President Coolidfie. He believed in
letting nature take its course, fhat
you must not cross any bridge until
you come to it, that you must not
think much about the bridge until

you have come to it, and that when
you do come to the bridge, you must
not cross it if you can help it.
Action Preferred
Obviously, the President prefers
action to drifting. Of all our Presi
dents, F.R. has probably done the
most in his first year. Whether he
can keep up the hot pace is another
question. Many observers think he
can't.
The reason thoy think he can't is
this. Some of the Administration's
policies are conflicting, such as the
NRA and AAA. Each of these has a
plan, but they have no common plan.
It is hardly wise to raise farm and
manufacturing prices at the same
time.
Too Much Work
As a matter of fact, the source of
this trouble is not in the Brain Trust,
but in the excessive burden of du
ties falling on the President him
' self. F.R. has had to make practi
cally all his own decisions; there
have boon so many to make that he
I has not had time to think things
through. The same thing happened
to ex-President Hoover.
This is why many of the Adminis
tration's supporters hope F.R. will
give up the idea of reform for h
whileâ€”at least until he has had time
Ito co-ordinate projects already
I started.
