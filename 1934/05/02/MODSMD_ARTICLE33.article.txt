# BULL SESSION
## A
						QUESTION OF FAITH 
### 
Lost bankrolls, lost vigor, lost sex
appeal—losses in general have dis
turbed the public for many years.
It is the general opinion of those
who think—and talk about what they
think (which means preachers and
professors)—that the modern world
has been characterized by loss: loss
of these things material, loss of the
old-time religion, loss of faith in
general. In short, this is the lost or
losing generation.
Unfortunately, the present gener
ation —as represented at Stanford—
has not lost everything. We have
inherited, and hold on to, u belief
that all freshmen are dumb, that it
is delightful to be drunk, that rules
must be made and preserved in cold
storage—even if they have become
rancid. These things — and many
more like them—we have not lost.
But worst of all, we have not lost
faith in each other.
Yesterday, a petition was circu
lated, signed, and submitted. It bore
the names of 170 students. The thing
was innocuous and innocently right.
But even though it had been insidi
ous and bad—instead of innocuous
and right, that would not have pre
vented at least half of the signers
from signing in ignorance (which
they did), signing without so much
as reading the contents of the peti
tion (which they did).
College men and women have a
certain blind faith in each other.
There is no very good reason for
this. At almost every election there
is abundant evidence of political
chicanery. At every examination
there is cheating and high-class
fraud. But still we are trusting. De
ception is smooth and hushed. The
flies in the campus ointment are
plucked out without public notice
(when they are plucked out).
Everything runs so smoothly, so
certainly, that we, like our rurai
contemporaries in lowa and Ne
braska, believe what we are told and
trust whomever tells it to us.
In the public mind college profes
sors are notoriously gullible and
stupid in simple matters. College
students, rightfully so, have acquired
the same stamp. Here, in the peace
and quiet of our pastoral life, we
have become mentally pastoral. We
can trust nature (we are not both
ered with crop failures), so we trust
each other. For every doubting
Thomas there are nine believing
Johnnies. We are rubes.
