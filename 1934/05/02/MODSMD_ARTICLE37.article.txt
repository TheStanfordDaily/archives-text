THE LONDON STRINO QUARTET
At the Veterans' Auditorium
A string quartet is a group of four
1 soloists, each of whom must attempt
! to show his fullest genius and at the
] same time be subordinate to the
i group—an ideal as impossible oi
1 fulfillment as the similar theory ol
! democracy. Of the few organizations
. approaching this ideal, the London
! Quartet is outstanding. The unity of
effect achieved by this group is truly
I remarkable: no one instrument
I seems to dominate, and none fails to
' remain individual. I let the paradox
| stand.
Where the London Quartet falls
! short is in tonal quality in ensemble
| effect, though each instrument in
! solo seemed perfect. This was espe-
I chilly noticeable in the Debussy
; quartet, where more depended upon
j tone color than on rhythmic effects
| and the interweaving of instruments.
| But even here the result was almost
j above reproach.
In a few spots, notably in the
Schubert "Death and the Maiden"
' quartet, the mechanical aspects were
audible: the impact of the bow on
; the strings, the snap of a pizzicato
I passage. Sometimes this was done
I effectively and added to Ihe emotion
conveyed, but occasionally one felt
;it was overdone. Also, the 'cello
! tones were usually rough—inten
i tionally, probably—and varied con
' siderably in tonal quality. In Wal
do-Warner's "The Pixy Ring" this
j aided greatly, but in the other se
| lections did not seem called for.
: But these are all very minor criti-
I cisms, given because major ones are
j wanting. The London Quartet gave
j an intelligently chosen program with
rare understanding, perfect cer
tainty, and a true vigor which string
quartet music is supposed to lack.
