Toyon lobby into a spring garden.

and surprise intermission soloists.
Shrubbery effects will add to the
scene.
Bids are selling for only $2.25, a
new low, and 130 instead of the usu
al 110 will be available. All the sur
plus, after dance and budget ex
penses are met, will go to the Con

Bids may be obtained at the
A.S.S.U. office or from the Toyon
committee: Glenn Martineau, chair
man, Ed Reems, John Cotton, Juiius
