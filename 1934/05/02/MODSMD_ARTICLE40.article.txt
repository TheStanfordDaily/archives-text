# Optimism Replaces Gloom As S.C. Meet Nears
## CARD TRACK FATE RESTS ON JUMPS; DASHES SATURDAY Willson's Sprinting Rouses Optimism in Century 
### 
Although Stanford is no longer
the reigning favorite to defeat
Southern California this Saturday at
Los Angeles'in the Card-Troian
dual track meet, due to the absence
of the Stanford Captain Gus Meier,
who is through for the season be
cause of a broken arm suffered last
Saturday, the results of the short
sprints and the two jumping events
are going a long way toward decid
ing the outcome of the affair.
These four competitions, the 100-
and 220-yard dashes, the high jump
and broad jump, appear to be ihe
events in which the Cards have the
best chance of upsetting the dope
buckets and thereby contributing
some unlooked for and very valu
able points to the Indian total.
Optimism in Dashes
One reason for the Card optimism
in the dashes is due to the great 9.8
seconds hundred scampered by Jim
Willson last Saturday to barely de
feat his teammate, Carl Thorns. This
time is as fast as that run by any of
the trio of Trojan stars, Parsons, Os
burn, and Draper, with the possible
exception of Draper, who is supposed
to have run 0.7 in finishing second to
California's Bob Kiesel in the Bear-
Trojan meet on April 7. Draper also
ran 9.8 to win the century in the
Fresno State-S.C. duel, but Par
sons and Osborn have failed to equal
this mark during the season. Will-
Son showed plenty of speed Satur
day and looked as though he might
run even faster if he had not tied up
in the last 10 yards to allow Thorns
to almost catch him.
The 220-yard affair will allow A1
Blackman, premier Card quarter
miler, to strut his stuff. Blackman's
mark of 21.4 made earlier this sea
son is equal to anything that Draper
and his cohorts have done, and A1
with his running mate, Thorns, may
cut in here for more digits than the
dopesters would like to concede
them.
With Phil Williams and Paul
Zaches rounding into the form that
enabled them to place in the S.C.
contest of last year, which the Cards
won without the services of Blazing
Ben Eastman, Stanford's opportuni
ties of garnering points in this com
petition seem brighter than they
have all season.
Williams leaped 23 feet S inches
Saturday, and Zaches in the Big
Meet propelled himself 23 feet 5
inches while barely fouling on two
24-feet efforts. McFadden, Crawford,
Junkkeit, and Olson, the Southern
ers' best, have done no better than
did Williams last week and if he and
Zaches can get together on the same
day, Stanford ought to take two
places here.
High Jump Problem
The high jump presents a very dif
ficult problem. Last year Lloyd
Schween lifted himself over the
cross bar at a height of slightly over
6 feet 4 inches to defeat all-Tropan
leapers, including Duncan Mc»
Naughton, the 1932 Olympic cham
pion. This year Lloyd has been un
able to consistently leap two inches
lower than this, while Howie Arthur
and Bob Smith, who complete this
year's trio of Card jumpers, have not
gone any higher than G feet 2 inches.
However, the Cards need not feel
too badly about their plight because
none of the Trojan trio of Brannan, (
Spicer, and Kerr has been able to go
any higher than height; so the high
jump should be a pretty much of a
toss up.

Los Angeles'in the Card-Troian
dual track meet, due to the absence
of the Stanford Captain Gus Meier,
who is through for the season be
cause of a broken arm suffered last
Saturday, the results of the short
sprints and the two jumping events
are going a long way toward decid
ing the outcome of the affair.
These four competitions, the 100-
and 220-yard dashes, the high jump
and broad jump, appear to be ihe
events in which the Cards have the
best chance of upsetting the dope
buckets and thereby contributing
some unlooked for and very valu
able points to the Indian total.
Optimism in Dashes
One reason for the Card optimism
in the dashes is due to the great 9.8
seconds hundred scampered by Jim
Willson last Saturday to barely de
feat his teammate, Carl Thorns. This
time is as fast as that run by any of
the trio of Trojan stars, Parsons, Os
burn, and Draper, with the possible
exception of Draper, who is supposed
to have run 0.7 in finishing second to
California's Bob Kiesel in the Bear-
Trojan meet on April 7. Draper also
ran 9.8 to win the century in the
Fresno State-S.C. duel, but Par
sons and Osborn have failed to equal
this mark during the season. Will-
Son showed plenty of speed Satur
day and looked as though he might
run even faster if he had not tied up
in the last 10 yards to allow Thorns
to almost catch him.
The 220-yard affair will allow A1
Blackman, premier Card quarter
miler, to strut his stuff. Blackman's
mark of 21.4 made earlier this sea
son is equal to anything that Draper
and his cohorts have done, and A1
with his running mate, Thorns, may
cut in here for more digits than the
dopesters would like to concede
them.
With Phil Williams and Paul
Zaches rounding into the form that
enabled them to place in the S.C.
contest of last year, which the Cards
won without the services of Blazing
Ben Eastman, Stanford's opportuni
ties of garnering points in this com
petition seem brighter than they
have all season.
Williams leaped 23 feet S inches
Saturday, and Zaches in the Big
Meet propelled himself 23 feet 5
inches while barely fouling on two
24-feet efforts. McFadden, Crawford,
Junkkeit, and Olson, the Southern
ers' best, have done no better than
did Williams last week and if he and
Zaches can get together on the same
day, Stanford ought to take two
places here.
High Jump Problem
The high jump presents a very dif
ficult problem. Last year Lloyd
Schween lifted himself over the
cross bar at a height of slightly over
6 feet 4 inches to defeat all-Tropan
leapers, including Duncan Mc»
Naughton, the 1932 Olympic cham
pion. This year Lloyd has been un
able to consistently leap two inches
lower than this, while Howie Arthur
and Bob Smith, who complete this
year's trio of Card jumpers, have not
gone any higher than G feet 2 inches.
However, the Cards need not feel
too badly about their plight because
none of the Trojan trio of Brannan, (
Spicer, and Kerr has been able to go
any higher than height; so the high
jump should be a pretty much of a
toss up.
Although Stanford is no longer
the reigning favorite to defeat
Southern California this Saturday at
Los Angeles'in the Card-Troian
dual track meet, due to the absence
of the Stanford Captain Gus Meier,
who is through for the season be
cause of a broken arm suffered last
Saturday, the results of the short
