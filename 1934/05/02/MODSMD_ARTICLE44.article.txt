# ALUSTIZA OUT WITH INFECTED LEG AS THORNHILL GATHERS GRID MEN
## 
### 
For some reason or other, Football
Coach Tiny Thornhill has not as yet
been able to muster his full veteran
team at once for any real spring
practice drills. First it was the base
ball players—Hamilton, Moscrip, and
Grayson — who were absent from
workouts, then tracksters Callaway
and Reynolds, now it's Frank Alu
stiza, incapacitated with an infected
leg, and Callaway and Reynolds
again, who have hopes of placing
against U.S.C. in the shot.
Bones Hamilton, the demon block
ing and running half, came out last
night for the first time, after seeing
the ball season to the last man out.
He was, of course, not completely
acquainted with thg new system of
, plays, but those can be learned, and
the baekfield of Alustiza. Grayson.
Hamilton, and another—any one of
four or five—looks at present to be

I a world-beater.
Thornhill plans to get under way 1
with the real thing from now until
I the finals, drilling the men four days ;
! a week and stressing every depart- ■
: ment of the game. Yesterday's prac- !
tice consisted of three or four teams
taking turns at running through the
various plays in the Thornhill rep- j
, ertoire —with numbers all the way j
i from 1 to 52.
To team with Monk Moscrip, who ■,
should be the class of the Coast j
flankmen this year, there are a mul- i
titude of possibilities. Foremost are
Keith Topping and Lyle Smith, who |
; played the majority of minutes of ;
classy ends in Carl Schott, Harold |
Elder, Walt Schouteau, and Bob j
Jenkins. These boys kept Coach j
Bradshaw constantly worried last ;
season as to who was going to start,
and they will continue to battle for
j jobs this fall.
