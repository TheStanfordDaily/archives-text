# VARSITY POLOISTS WILL TILT WITH SAN MATEO RIDERS ON SATURDAY
## 
### 
First string Stanford poloists will
make their first campus appearance
of the quarter Saturday when they
ride against Will Tevis' San Mateo
four in what promises to be the
hardest fought and best game of the
I year.
This will be the playoff of a two
â–  game series split between the two
teams when they met early in March
at Beresford. Both times the score
was so close that Saturday's game
, might easily go to either one.
Lupe Luppen, Russ Rasmussen,
Bill Rogers, and Bob Fullerton are
i Ihe fast riding quartet who have
i brought victories to Stanford by de
feating every team they have come
I up against so far. They will do most
of the work Saturday, although Bill
\ Enemark stands a good chance of

! getting in the game after the high
class mallet wielding he displayed |
in the Oregon State games last week. |
Riding for the San Mateo team j
will be Tevis, Gilmore, Mosley, and
: McGee, all of them ranking poloists j
of the Coast. They are the same four j
who rode against Stanford in the I
first game in March. Because of their i
| high goal ratings, the Indians will !
1 probably start Saturday with a
l handicap of at least one goal.
This will be the only chance of the j
| season to see a really close polo game j
on the campus, all the other teams j
on the schedule being rated consid- j
; erably lower than Caplain Gordan's i
1 Stanford squad. The game will be 1
! played at 3 o'clock Saturday after
noon on the Highway Field. Adm'S-
I sion of 25 and 40 cents will be I
I charged.
