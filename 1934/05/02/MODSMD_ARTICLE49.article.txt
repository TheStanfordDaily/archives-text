# WEATHER HALTS GOLF TOURNEY
## 
### 
That rain and cloudy weather have
taken their toll in the Stanford All-
University golf tournament became
apparent yesterday when Coach Ed
die Twiggs announced that as yet
none have played the qualifying
round of 18 holes.
Plenty of time still remains for iTie
necessary number to play as qualify
ing extend. 1 ? through the week. It is
apparent to observers that a great
deal of interest will be taken as for
the first time in several years, the
titleholder will not be back to de
fend the title. It will be an open
race.
At the present time the golf squad
men are favored but there are plenty
of men from the graduate schools
and the frosh squad who can make
them step.
One faculty member, Roy Seale, is
playing splendid golf and may be
able to come through. In last year's
tournament Seale qualified and sur
vived the earlier rounds of the tour
nament.
The freshmen will have George
Kuklinski as their outstanding
threat. George played in the first
position for the greater part of win
ter and fall quarters. He is capable
of shooting very good golf.
The Law School has two men that
are capable of holding their own in
any company, Bill Dwyer and Chuck
Teague. Both of them play good con
sistent golf, a winner's game.
