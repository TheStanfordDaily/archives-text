CARDS, LOUISIANA STATE
STRONG AT N.C.A.A.
Looking ahead a couple of months,
we see a great three-way battle for j
N.C.A.A. honors in Los Angeles wilh
Los Angeles with Stanford and |
Louisiana Slate trying to spill the
host, U.S.C., last year's intercolle- '
giate champions. Stanford has a 1
strong duel meet team, but should
be even stronger in a meet such as |
the N.C.A.A. because of the fact that
Indian strength is concentrated in
certain events.
j There's only one hitch to that rea
j soning. Louisiana State has all her
.strength concentrated in the same
events. With Dunn and Lyman in
the weights, Stanford could expect
to garner a majority of the points in ,
those events, but the Southerners'
have that pesky Jack Torrance with
records of 55 feet 1 1 '•> inches in the
shot and over 150 feet in the discus.
Sam Klopstock is a great hurdler,
but Louisiana State has John Mor-
I riss in the highs who chased Gus
Meier to his world record time last
year and Glenn Hardin in the lows,
Olympic Games 400 meter hurdler
and one of the best in the 220 low
hurdles in the country. This same
Hardin will push Blackman, Lu- .
Valle and the rest of them so hard I
he may run right over them, having |
turned the 440 in better than 48 flat.
MOTTKAM TO MEET
STRONG RIVALS
Johnny Mottram and Duane Pur
j vis of Purdue, national intercolle
giate champion, are counted the two
best javelin tossers in the country, j
both being capable of over 220 feet,
but Nathan Blair of L.S.U. tossed |
the spear 209 feet Saturday at the j
: Drake relays and should get better ;
I as the season goes along. Two hun
dred and nine feet is good enough to
| beat even the best on an off day.
Lowering our sights a little and |
taking a look at next Saturday's j
1 Stanford-Trojan meet, we see a great
relay battle in the offing. The Card
quartet of Dear, Burris, Dellinger,
and Blackman set a new Big Meet j
mark and has the best time on the
Coast to date, but the Trojans have
yet to put their strongest team on !
the track.
The quartet doing most of U.S.C.'s
relay work has consisted of Bob
Reed, 49.8 from a standing start for
the first lap; Bob Guthrie, 48.5; ;
Harry Tompkins, 47.5; and Johnny i
McCarthy, 46.9. the last three being 1
from running starts. To strengthen
this quartet Cromwell could run A1 j

Fitch, a 48.4 quarter-miler, who has,
spent most of his career sprinting
and has a pretty fast start, and Ed
Ablowich, who runs around 48 flat t
and was a member of America's 1600
meter Olympic relay team.
ALL-SPORT COMPETITION
IN OFFING
About a week ago this column
suggested a competition which would
include as many sports as possible j
to select the best athlete in school. !
(The idea, by the way, as far as this
campus is concerned, originated with !
Dave Cooke.) Since then we have !
had a number of favorable comments
and Marvie Kahn, intramural man
ager, has offered to take it under the
wing of the intramural department. !
Points for living groups entering I
enough men will probably be
awarded and trophies may be do- j
nated. Suggestions as to events and 1
methods of competition will be wel
comed. —Tremaine j

Johnny Mottram and Duane Pur
j vis of Purdue, national intercolle
giate champion, are counted the two
best javelin tossers in the country, j
both being capable of over 220 feet,

the spear 209 feet Saturday at the j
: Drake relays and should get better ;

Lowering our sights a little and |
taking a look at next Saturday's j
1 Stanford-Trojan meet, we see a great
relay battle in the offing. The Card
quartet of Dear, Burris, Dellinger,

mark and has the best time on the
Coast to date, but the Trojans have
yet to put their strongest team on !
the track.
The quartet doing most of U.S.C.'s
relay work has consisted of Bob
Reed, 49.8 from a standing start for
the first lap; Bob Guthrie, 48.5; ;
Harry Tompkins, 47.5; and Johnny i
McCarthy, 46.9. the last three being 1

this quartet Cromwell could run A1 j

Fitch, a 48.4 quarter-miler, who has,
spent most of his career sprinting
and has a pretty fast start, and Ed
Ablowich, who runs around 48 flat t
and was a member of America's 1600

N.C.A.A. honors in Los Angeles wilh
Los Angeles with Stanford and |
Louisiana Slate trying to spill the
host, U.S.C., last year's intercolle- '
giate champions. Stanford has a 1
strong duel meet team, but should
be even stronger in a meet such as |
the N.C.A.A. because of the fact that
Indian strength is concentrated in
certain events.
j There's only one hitch to that rea
j soning. Louisiana State has all her
.strength concentrated in the same
events. With Dunn and Lyman in
the weights, Stanford could expect
to garner a majority of the points in ,
those events, but the Southerners'
have that pesky Jack Torrance with
records of 55 feet 1 1 '•> inches in the
shot and over 150 feet in the discus.
Sam Klopstock is a great hurdler,
but Louisiana State has John Mor-
I riss in the highs who chased Gus
Meier to his world record time last
year and Glenn Hardin in the lows,
Olympic Games 400 meter hurdler
and one of the best in the 220 low
hurdles in the country. This same
