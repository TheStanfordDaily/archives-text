# Catalogue Tells Language Requirement Alterations
## 
### 
Students who desire to take more j
than two years of French or Spanish j
need no longer take the second year
of the language five times a week, !
according to the May 1 publication
of the 1934-35 Announcement of ;
Courses.
The courses are divided into two â– 
and three unit courses which may j
be taken together if desired. These >
divisions enable students who wish
to improve their reading knowledge
of the language to take second-year
reading courses without any gfam
mar and continue with certain read
ing courses in the upper division. It
also enables students who plan to do
advanced work later on to pursue
their study of the langauge, even *f
their other subjects do not permit
them to devote five hours a week
to it. i
