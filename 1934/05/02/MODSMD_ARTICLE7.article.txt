# Boggs, Treat, Martin Discuss Pacific Commercial Relations
## 
### 
The greatest hope for future amity !
in the Pacific lies in a closer trade
understanding between the respec
tive powers, in the opinion of Dr. |
T. H. Boggs of the Stanford Econo
mics Departments, and specialist on j
international trade.
"If the multi-lateral commercial j
accord, designed to cement a new
Pan-Pacific commercial rapport be- j
! tween United States, Japan, and
i Latin America, .such as was proposed
from the Tokyo foreign office re
cently, becomes a reality," .stated Dr.
Boggs, '"it should eliminate the fric- .
tion now existing in the Pacific ba- j
sin, irt the scramble for international J
markets."
Japanese Trade
At present, United States takes
nearly 90 per cent of Japan's raw |
: silk exports, while the Eastern em
pire is our best cotton customer.
Moreover, Japan buys more from us
than they sell to us. Dr. Boggs ex
plained, however, that Latin America
is constanly buying more from Japan
than the Rising Sun Kingdom can
absorb in reciprocal trade. If the
| United States will assimilate this ad
j verse Latin American trade-balance,
1 to apply against the adverse Nip
ponese trade-balance with us such
as Japan proposes, a great step will
have taken toward stimulating coiyi
merce and peaceful development of
the resources of the Pacific area.
Dr. Payson J. Treat of the Stanford
History Department, and an author
ity on the Far East, sees in Japan's
withdrawal from the League of Na

tions, the confining of Nipponese ac
tivities to Asia and the Pacific. "The
future will see increased competition
for trade in the Pacific markets,
remarked Dr. Treat, "and if an un
derstanding could be reached such
as proposed by the Japanese foreign
office a potential source of strife
will be averted." Japan's merchant
marine is second to none, Dr. Treat
stated.
Commerce Pact
A life-long student of Latin Amer
ica, Dr. P. A. Martin, of the Stanford
History Department, had this to say
of the suggested trade accord: ''Ja
pan's proposed three-way commer
mercial pact would certainly be
most desirable, but it strikes me as
difficult to put across. United States
has heavy financial investments in
Latin American republics, such as
Chile and Columbia. I do not be
lieve our capitalistic interests would
readily consent to trade restriction
quotas south of the Rio Grande.'
Dr. Martin further added that the
large number of Latin American
states involved, each with diverse
products to export, could only be
blaifketcd in a trade-pact with the
United States and Japan through
great diplomatic skill.
"I feel the nearest approach to a
solution to this trade-problem be
tween Japan, United States, and
Latin America lies in the reciprocally
flexible tariff agreements between
countries on ennumerated commo
dities, such as President Roosevelt
| is now empowered to enter upon.

difficult to put across. United States
has heavy financial investments in
Latin American republics, such as
Chile and Columbia. I do not be
lieve our capitalistic interests would
readily consent to trade restriction
quotas south of the Rio Grande.'
Dr. Martin further added that the
large number of Latin American
states involved, each with diverse
products to export, could only be
blaifketcd in a trade-pact with the
United States and Japan through
great diplomatic skill.
"I feel the nearest approach to a
solution to this trade-problem be
tween Japan, United States, and
Latin America lies in the reciprocally
flexible tariff agreements between
countries on ennumerated commo
dities, such as President Roosevelt
| is now empowered to enter upon.
The greatest hope for future amity !
in the Pacific lies in a closer trade
understanding between the respec
tive powers, in the opinion of Dr. |
T. H. Boggs of the Stanford Econo
mics Departments, and specialist on j
international trade.
"If the multi-lateral commercial j
accord, designed to cement a new
Pan-Pacific commercial rapport be- j
! tween United States, Japan, and
i Latin America, .such as was proposed
from the Tokyo foreign office re
cently, becomes a reality," .stated Dr.
Boggs, '"it should eliminate the fric- .
tion now existing in the Pacific ba- j
sin, irt the scramble for international J
markets."
Japanese Trade
At present, United States takes
nearly 90 per cent of Japan's raw |
: silk exports, while the Eastern em
pire is our best cotton customer.
Moreover, Japan buys more from us
than they sell to us. Dr. Boggs ex
plained, however, that Latin America
is constanly buying more from Japan
than the Rising Sun Kingdom can
absorb in reciprocal trade. If the
| United States will assimilate this ad
j verse Latin American trade-balance,
1 to apply against the adverse Nip
ponese trade-balance with us such
as Japan proposes, a great step will
have taken toward stimulating coiyi
merce and peaceful development of
the resources of the Pacific area.
Dr. Payson J. Treat of the Stanford
History Department, and an author
ity on the Far East, sees in Japan's
withdrawal from the League of Na

tions, the confining of Nipponese ac
tivities to Asia and the Pacific. "The
future will see increased competition
for trade in the Pacific markets,
remarked Dr. Treat, "and if an un
derstanding could be reached such
as proposed by the Japanese foreign
office a potential source of strife
will be averted." Japan's merchant
marine is second to none, Dr. Treat
stated.
Commerce Pact
A life-long student of Latin Amer
ica, Dr. P. A. Martin, of the Stanford
History Department, had this to say
of the suggested trade accord: ''Ja
pan's proposed three-way commer
mercial pact would certainly be
most desirable, but it strikes me as
difficult to put across. United States
has heavy financial investments in
Latin American republics, such as
Chile and Columbia. I do not be
lieve our capitalistic interests would
