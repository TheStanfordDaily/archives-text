senior engineering students, or the
highest eighth of the junior class.

petition, compiled by the members
in the form of an elaborate booklet.
History in Petition
Also the history of Stanford and
of the School of Engineering, ac
counts of the qualifications of the
faculty in this school, and descrip

of which will be sent to each of the
65 chapters of the organizations.
