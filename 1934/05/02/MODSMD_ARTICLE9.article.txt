# Sororities on Spot Tonight
## 
### 
To present findings of an A.W.S.
commission investigating the ad
visability of discontinuing sororities
on the campus, Greek and Barb
representatives will be matched in
debate at the Forum in Room 214 at
8 o'clock tonight.
The affirmative side of the ques
tion: "Resolved, that sororities are
desirable on the Stanford campus"
will be upheld by Helen Ray, Theta.
Jane Hillebrand, Union Club presi
dent and ex-sorority member at
Swarthmore College, will tpresen
the negative. Frank Fullenwider
will act as chairman of the Forum.
Summary Distributed
A brief summary of the findings
of the Sorority Commission has
been distributed to all women stu
dents as an introduction to tonight's
discussion. Enlargement and, ex
planation of the advantages and dis
advantages will be made by the
faction leaders at the Forum.
Basing her plea on the agreeable
social conditions afforded by soro
rity life and the belief that present
rushing system evils can be eradi
cated by "commoh sense revision of
rushing rules," the affirmative rep
resentative will open the informal
debate. Higher scholarship of Hall
women and the "impossibility of
satisfactory rushing and well
rounded social relations with soro
rity groupings" will be the high
points of the negative combat.
Men Invited
Ten minute speeches by the rival
spokesmen will be followed by
short discussions from student
members of the audience. Though
primarily a problem for women,
men students and the general pub
lic will be admitted. Only students
will be given the opportunity to
speak, however.
The Forum is being given over to
the sorority discussion tonight as
an opportunity for women to hear
both sides of the problem before
voting on the issue at the Women's
Clubhouse corner tomorrow from
8 to 2 o'clock. Questionnaires will
be of the qualitative opinion type to
allow the expression of preferences.
Because of tomorrow's ballot, no
vote will be taken at the Forum.
