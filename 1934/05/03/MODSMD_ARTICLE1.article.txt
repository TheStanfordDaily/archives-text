Final plans and details of the Con

lated last night when 20 chairrhen
of the campaign met in general ses
sion in the home of Professor and
Mrs. Payson J. Treat. Red Cross,
general chairman of the drive, out
lined the schedule of events and
reviewed previous canvasses.
Miss Ruth Spande, supervisor of
the home, and Dr. Charles Gardner,
president of the Board of Directors
of the home, spoke concerning op
eration and financing of the home.

Labor Day plans are in the final
stages of perfection, Kahn said yes
terday, as the drive enters the final
week. Work at the Convalescent
Home will begin immediately after
lunch; transportation is being ar
ranged from the dormitories and
living groups to the Home.
Meal Provided
Following the actual work on the
grounds, all students will eat the
barbecued, meal prepared by Sam
McDonald, famed Stanford barbe
cuer. Sororities are furnishing the
usual amount of sandwiches, but
with an unusual flavor and quality,
said Merrill Collett, barbecue chair
man.
A full entertainment program has
been planned by Parmer Fuller,
who is lining up outstanding talent
of the campus.
Bean Day Aids
Campus culinary reaches a new
level Monday when Chairman Dick
Miles' Bean Day does its part in the
drive. An enticing menu, despite
the fact that beans will be the
mainstay, is being planned by Miles
to supplant the regular noon-day
meal. Eating groups are falling in
line behind the event with a rapidity
that promises 100 per cent support,
Miles said.
Miles stressed the point that al
though the bean dinner may not
be the most delicious, it is one of
the most healthful and invigorating
meals possible.
