# Patriotism In War Scored
## 
### 
"I hope that in the next war peo
ple will avoid the mistake of being
patriotic. I think I may say this
because I was one of the damned
fools who was in 1917." Thus stated
Professor Richard T. LaPiere in an
informal discussion last night spon
sored by the International
Club.
He said in time of war, people
should think as individuals and not
as a mass. If they did, they would
realize that they had nothing at ali
to gain, and would refuse to fight.
"People think in terms of drama,
and must have a villain for their
drama of the causes of war. There
fore they pick the munition makers
to fill this role. But these are not to
blame," said LaPiere. "We are, be
cause we allow a lot of antiquated,
inexpedient ideals about courage and
heroism to be fostered on us If the
people would refuse to fight, there
would be no war."
After the lecture there was open
discussion in which LaPiere an
swered questions from the floor.
