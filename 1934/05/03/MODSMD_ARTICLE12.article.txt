### 
Psychology, its nature, history, i
| and relation to other departments .
' and the professions, was the sub
i ject of Professor Lewis M. Terman,
j executive head of Psychology, in a
: major department talk last night in
tho Little Theatre.
I For the benefit of prospective ma- :
| jors, Professor Terman divided the!
I study of psychology into six i
; branches—laboratory (brass instru
! ment psychology), animal behavior,
j educational, clinical, vocational, and |
psychical research.
Emphasizing the fact that psy
j chology is closely related to many
departments of the university, Ter
j man stated that there are instruc-
J tors in the department who also
j teach in biology, graduate school of
! business, medical school, and edu
j cation.
"Psychology is a misconception in
i many persons' minds," Professor
! Terman said. "I am surprised at the
number of college students who
j think of the subject as dealing with j

spiritualism, strange mental proc
esses, and psycho-analysis."
Speaking of aptitudes, Terman
said, "Psychology is an abstract
subject and besides a good intellect
a prospective major should possess
a genuine interest in the subject,
industry, and an appreciation of
human nature. And as for salaries,
up until the last two years our
Ph.D. students have all been able to
step out into jobs paying from $2000
to $3000, and the M.A.'s into $1500 to
$2500 jobs."
Professor Terman advised all stu-
dents entering law, medicine, edu-
cation, and even engineering to
study some psychology as one of
the most important phases of knowl
edge they can possess.
In closing Professor Terman made
one startling prediction—"l believe
that in the future there will be psy
chologists and physicians working
together all over the country in a
combination known as marriage bu
reaus to aid people in choosing suit
able, healthy, proper mates."
