# Army Gives Brief Review
## Inspection Before General Sherwood A. Cheney 
### 
With immaculate guns and cais
sons drawn by flashy red saddle
blanketed horses, Stanford's R.O.
T.C. presented a colorful appearance
as it passed in brief review before
Brigadier General Sherwood A.
Cheney yesterday afternoon. The
parade was staged on the Highway
polo field at 2:30 o'clock, as part of
the annual 9th Corps Area inspec
tion of the local military depart
ment.
Yesterday's inspection was pri
marily an administrative one, Major
E. C. Williams emphasized, so that
General Cheney did not devote
much time in witnessing actual drill,
but left before the maneuvers were
completed. He was interested in the
organization records, office, and the
condition of horses and material.
A second inspection will be made
the latter part of this month by
Colonel John R. Starkey, Field Ar
tillery, which will be principally
tactical. Battery and gun drill will
be given special attention at this
time.
The inspecting officer did not
comment on the unit yesterday, the
Military Department divulged. A
report will be made to the Com
manding General of the 9th Corps
Area who will, in several weeks,
notify President Wilbur as to the
condition of the local department.
The combined results of General
Cheney's and Colonel Starkey's in
spections will determine the effi
ciency rating of the R.O.T.C. here
for the current year.
