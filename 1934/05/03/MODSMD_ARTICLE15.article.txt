# Quad Sellout Is Foreseen
## 
### 
Less than a month remains before
the appearance of the 1934 Quad,
which is scheduled to be distributed
j on Tuesday, May 29, says Business
Manager Hal Whitfield.
The sale of the 1,700 capies which
have been ordered has been par
ticularly large during the last month,
leaving comparatively few copies for
last-minute buyers. Whitfield ex
pects that there will be a sellout this
year just as there was last year.
Seniors especially are advised to
purchase their Quads as soon as pos
sible since the annual is put out
with emphasis on their activities so
as to give them a lusting record of
their final year in the University,
says Whitfield. To date there has
been an unprecedented lack of sup
port from Ihom. Of the 540 seniors
in Ihe senior section, only a small
percentage have as yet purchased
their Quads.
The Quad representative will be in
front of the post, office from 8-12
o'clock this morning to take orders
for the book. The price is $5.65, or
$6.15 with name engraved on the
cover.
