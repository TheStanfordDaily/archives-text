# LESS THAN 200 WOMEN ATTEND ROW DISCUSSION
## Desirability of Sororities on Campus Is Debate Subject; Helen Ray Speaks Affirmatively; Jane Hillebrand Negatively 
### 
Before an audience (if less than 200 women ami a handful of men, the
question: 4 Resolved, that sororities are desirable on the Stanford campus,"
was upheld last night in an open Forum by Helen Ray, Theta, and opposed
by Jane Hillebrand, Union Club president and former Swarthmore College
sorority member. No vote was taken.

* Introduced by Frank Fullenwider,
chairman, Helen Ray opened her ar
gument by affirming there is little
distinction between Row and Hall
w omen, and that .she believed sorori
ties were preferable to cliques.
Advantages of System
Listing the advantages of the sys
tem, the speaker cited such examples
as encouragement of scholarship,
i though she admitted non-sorority
women at Stanford have higher av
j erages than Row women; develop-
I menl of honor, initiative, unselfish
ness, and friendship, through the
intimate contact a sorority affords;
the home-lnve atmosphere of the
sorority, as opposed to the institu
' tionality of large dormitories; and
; the contact encouraged between
i University and alumnae.
Jane Hillebrand, speaking for the
j negative side, opened her speech
with a .short resume of the history
of sororities and their prominence
throughout the country.
"But,'' she slated, "we are con
cerned with a practical evaluation
of sororities as they exist here at
Stanford. If they are a mistake, the
| jonsistency of that mistake does not
[ make them any better."
Union Unit Happy
Citing the Union Club dormitori
lies as examples of improved Uni
versity housing units, Miss Hille
brand stated that the girls are living
in these houses this year have been
exceptionally happy.
Concluding with the assertion
that, though sororities have advan
tages for their members, a non
sorority system is possible with the
same advantages for everyone, not a
r limited few. The negative speaker
gave a list of sorority disadvantages,
then ceded th<> floor to general dis
cussion.
Voting wfll be held on the question
of sorority abolishment today from
8 to 2 o'clock in front of the Wom
en's Clubhouse. Concerning the bai
loting, Jeanne Millard, A.W.S. presi
dent, yesterday issued the following
statement:
The questionnaire-ballot is an at
tempt to investigate all phases of the
sociological problem: What social
set-up should be provided for future
Stanford women?
"We, the present generation of
Stanford women, are in a position to
use our experience in forming a
group opinion on this question. How
ever, that group opinion will be
valid only if it is all-inclusive. In
other words, every Stanford woman
is urged to vote, not merely to ex
press her own opinion, but also to
insure the validity of the total vote."'
