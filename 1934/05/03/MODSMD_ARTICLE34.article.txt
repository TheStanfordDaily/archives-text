### 
So that work can be started on all
SEKA projects for May next Moil
day or Tuesday, Mrs. Irene Spen
ner, who is in charge of student em
ployment, asks that all departments
send in their written l-equests this
; week.
Each request should name the
project, .slate whether it requires
skilled or unskilled workers, and
name any student or students that
the department wishes to continue
work in its field.
at once to obtain new release cards.
Students who have been registered
for employment, have taken out tui
tion notes, or arc doing some regular
outside work but who have not
worked under the SERA program,
should sign a waiting list in Mrs.
Spenncr's office if they desire em
ployment this month.
