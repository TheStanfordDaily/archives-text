# A 						Chance for More Laureis

Tlii' fate of Stanford's hoped-for representation al the
annual 1.C.1-A. track and licit I meet in Philadelphia late
lliis month rests in Hie hands of the Hoard of Athletic Con
trol, which will meet this evening. When prospects of
Dink Templeton's stars grew dim with decreased incomes
in the H.A.C., the campus went to work to give the track
men their trip. Enough money for only two men was se
cured. Since then, at least one graduate member of the
hoard has expressed himself as being favorable to putting
out the necessary additional funds.
t'niversity of Southern California's withdrawal from
the meet this year is, we learn, due to a temporary interest
iu the National Collegiate A.A. meeting which the Trojans
are sponsoring. Just because Troy sees fit to drop out is
no reason why Stanford should. The 1.C.1-A. is still looked
upon as the championship meet of America. Stanford has
a great chance to win. The laurels should be hers.
