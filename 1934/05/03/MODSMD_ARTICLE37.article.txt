# Tomorrow's Vote Is Important
## 
### 
The new A.S.S.C. constitution, revised and constructed
lo meet the demands of the entire campus, goes before the
electorate tomorrow for official approval. A two-thirds
vote is necessary for its final passage, and popular opinion
has it that the constitutidli, agreeable to all, should find
plenty of hackers.
Willi the present document almost useless, very am
biguous, and harmful to good student government, ii be
comes imperative that the new deal for I lie A.S.S.I 1 , be
heartily endorsed, it isn't too wise lo let the other fellow
do one's voting, when a small minority might possibly
block its passage.
Slop til the polls near the Law Steps between <S and 2
o'clock tomorrow. Kvcrv vole counts.
