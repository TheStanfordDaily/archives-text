# Respect?

Members of Ihe Quadrangle Club, one of Ihe little
hcard-of groups on Ihe campus but one which retains a
vital interest in Stanford, are determined that smoking on
Ihe Quad should be stopped. The Daily commends Iheir
stand, and passes il on to Ihe students with this one ques-
I ion:
Is respect for a worthy tradition and for manners to be
outweighed bv selfishness and Ihe rudeness of failing to
recognize Ihe fact that others cannot do their best work
when somebody nearby is blowing smoke in their faces?
The matter is one of courtesy. College people are sup
posed lo contain some of these elements. They can best
display their willingness to co-operate by stepping out
side Ihe class rooms and off Ihe Quad if they must take
lime out for a smoke.
