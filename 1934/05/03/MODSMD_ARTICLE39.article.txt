Although hiking no stand pro or con regarding the
question of abolition or continuance of the sorority system
at Stanford, the Daily docs urge all campus women to
appear at the polls today and register their opinions on
this question which is supposed to be of importance in
deciding what the Stanford of the future will be, what will
lie the living conditions of women on the Farm in future
years.
That any constructive answer to the question may be
secured, it is necessary that an expression of opinion be
received from all the women on the campus. No vote of
a small percentage can be considered accurately represent
ative of the feelings of the whole or even of a majoritv.
