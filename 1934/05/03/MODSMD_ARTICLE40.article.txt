# WHY IT'S NEWS
## The 						Bootleggers Are Still Doing Well 
### CROMPTON BANGS Jr 
Repeal was supposed to get rid of
the bootlegger. Nntil a few weeks
ago, most people thought it had. The
report of the United Stales Al
cohol Commissioner gave them a
real jolt. Among other things, it
said that the bootlegging business is
fully as large as the legitimate in
dustry. Why is the 'leggcr .still doing
business, and what can be done to
stop him?
Why It Pays
In the first place, there are still
about 25 more or less legally dry
states—nearly all damp. Naturally
all the liquor sold in these states is
sold by bootleggers. This amounts
to about half of the illegal stuff.
This is to be expected. But Fed
eral officials are beginning to dis
cover that bootleggers are pretty
well entrenched in the wet states,
too. For example, in extremely wet
Chicago, about 40 per cent of all the
liquor is illegally distilled or sold.
There are plenty of reasons for
this mess. The biggest one is the
stupidity of the government. Offi
cials fired most of the enforcement
officers when repeal came. No longer
bothered, bootleggers prospered and
chiseled in on the legal liquor mar
ket. The Federal courts were ready
to convict any and all violators of
the internal revenue laws, but there
were not enough agents to do the
arresting—which is very necessary.

Besides, some of the states have
made it so hard for anyone to buy a
drink legally that they have driven
all the business right up to the boot
legger's front door. Other states have
gone into the liquor business, but
have too few stores and too little in
them. Still other states have been
too lazy to enforce even their own
liquor sales laws.
Any Remedy?
Bootleggers are not in business for
their health. There is still plenty of
money in it; business is still about
as good as ever. Every time a still
or distillery is raided, another im
mediately .springs up somewhere. 11
must pay. At the same lime, the
U.S. is losing at least a hundred mil
lion dollars a year in taxes.
Since people are going to drink, no
matter what the laws have to say
about it, it looks as though the besi
thing to do is to try to collect the
taxes now being lost.
To collect the taxes being evaded
by bootleggers, at least two thousand
more enforcement agents are needed.
I: would pay to hire them, for the
main job now is to catch the boot
legger; before repeal, the main job
was 1o convict him. Since the courts
are now quite ready to convict boot
leggers, the job seems well worth
trying. And the U.S. could use the
money, and the people could have
, better liquor.
