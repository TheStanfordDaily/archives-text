## SORORITIES DINGED 
### 
The Editor, Sir: ,
The Stanford sorority system, un
democratic in the days of the "500."'
intolerable with the "800," untenable
with 1,000 women, today faces a
student poll.
To thinking members of the col
lege community, harsh social lines
drawn by the presence on the cam
pus of sororities seem medieval, al
most primitive. Survival of the fit
test cannot account" for heterogene
ous final pledge lists, nor do the
existence of house "factions" indi
cate that members are chosen be
cause of their ability to contribute
to the happiness of the living group
as such.
Sororities, limited in number by
ihe Trustees, limited in membership
by the Trustees, can become at best
a political minority, remain a social
menace. Based on allegiance to a
small group, rather than to the Uni
versity itself, they violate demo
cratic principles, run contrarwisc to
the motto of the University.
Consistently self-centered until
now, sororities have this opportunity
to indicate consciousness, and by
favoring gradual abolition, may aid
in the building of a greater, more
democratic University.
