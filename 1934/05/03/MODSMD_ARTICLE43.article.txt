# BULL SESSION
## AN ONION FOR JIMMY 
### 
California, now overburdened with
"possible candidates," will soon be
groaning with the political pain in
cident to the election of a new gov
ernor. At least, there will probably
be a new governor. It is remotely
possible that the sunstruck governor
of the sunshine state will once more
mount his white Arabian horse, and
ride triumphantly down a lane
strewn with gardenias and corpses
to the state capitol.
There are two very serious things
that can happen to California in the
near future:' another San Francisco
earthquake and the re-election of
Governor Rolph. Of the two possible
catastrophies, we believe the second
would be by far the worse. Ait
earthquake is unavoidable.
It is, of course, rather difficult to
believe that there exists even the
remotest chance of a Rolph re-elec
tion. One does not usually think of
being grateful to those who en
courage murder. One likes to think
that the higher officers of the land
might have a grain of economic
horse sense. The revolting spectacle
at St. James Park, and the regressive
sales tax of San Simeon Ranch re
main with us in memory and reality.
But, more important than cold
facts in politics is consummate nerve.
Ii these blunders have not stopped
Rolph himself from considering re
election, it is possible that they will
not .stop the public from considering
him for re-election. That is sad and
true.
But this side of election lies a
gubernatorial campaign. If the gar
denia on horseback starts off on that
political venture, it is very likely he
will suffer a relapse—and he forced
to retire from the campaign. That
also would be a calamity. With the
American addiction to martyrs,
Rolph removed from the campaign
by illness, might well become a
model for future generations of poli
ticians. If it becomes repeatedly
evident that the public even thinks
of considering such specimens for
office, there is nothing to prevent us
from being deluged with more of the
same variety.
Politicians learn by experience—
and the people are given their expe
rience by politicians. The people of
the great State of California have
been taking it in the neck and the
purse for many years. It is time to
lay down the law to political nit-wits
and jazz-babies. Electors of Califor
nia, unite! Smash Rolphism!
