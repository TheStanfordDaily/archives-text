# Stuart Sails for Europe To Probe into Diplomacy
## 
### 
A visit of consulates, embassies,
and legations in practically every
state of Europe will be made by Dr.
Graham Stuart, professor of politi
cal science at Stanford, during a
nine months' leave. Dr. Stuart will
sail from New York on July 3.
The Stanford professor is par
ticularly interested in collecting data
on exceptional incidents which face
diplomatic representatives which are
not covered by international law. He
plans to write a monograph on his
findings which may become the ba
sis for new international law. Cor
dell Hull, United States Secretary
of State, has given Stuart a letter
of introduction.
