AIRLINES — President Roosevelt
is to speak over both radio chains
today at 1 o'clock in acceptance of a
memorial to William Jennings Bry
an, deceased Democratic leader.
Columbia's frantic efforts to find
someone to take the place of Alex
ander Wollcott, now taking a needed
rest, have been crowned with suc
cess in the form of not one—but two
—candidates.
James Thurber, nonsensical hu
morist who is perhaps better known
for his drawings of unhappy animals
and dilapidated humans, is the first,
and he broadcasts tonight over
KFRC at 6:45 o'clock. Listen in and
be amused (we hope) by this suc
cessor to the incomparable Town
Crier. The second pinch-hitter is
Roy Helton, poet and novelist, who
is on the air every Saturday at 5:30
o'clock. —Emerson M. Honan
