AH. WILDERNESS! (O'Neill)
Al the Curran Theatre
I Will Rogers' performance as Nat
; Miller, the small-town newspaper
! proprietor, is no more thorough and
| satisfactory than his work in pic
tures would lead one to expect. Still
he retains that audience appeal
j which has made him a star, though
in comparison to George M. Cohans
j carefully expert handling of this
, role mere appeal seems little enough
| to offer.
Rogers' chief faults are a tendency
to sentimentalize, which is rather
j obvious at the end of the play, over-
I use of the halting speech by which
{ he is so well known, and failure to
| achieve the tolerant good-humored
j wisdom which made Cohan's per
j formanfce so memorable. But in
comparison to the rest of the cast
Rogers seems excellent.
His role is the only major one,
however, which affords much op
i portunity for interesting handling,
| and it is perhaps unfair to condemn
certain of these performers when
the faults are in the main not theirs
, but the author's. Richard, the son,
I about whose misdemeanors and mis
j comprehensions the action devolves,
I is a character evidently written to
be over-acted. If this was really
! O'Neill's wish, William Janney ful
fills it perfectly. And so with several
other roles.
For commendation we may single
! out Lex Lindsay, who restrained
'quite neatly an easily burlesqued
"bit" of a college boy, and Martha
i Mayo, who more nearly achieved a
I complete characterization than any
! other member of the cast. For cen-
I sure, Ralph M. Remley, who over
! played his drunk scene, one of the
few genuine comedy scenes of the
i play, and Jay Ward, who was worse
! than is permissable even for a child
I actor.
To a Rogers fan, this show may
be recommended, since it provides
j an opportunity for the neophyte to
i see the idol at close range, doing
i just the things which have made him
|an idol. To anyone else, the per
; formance will probably prove rather
boring. —Benet

j comprehensions the action devolves,
I is a character evidently written to
be over-acted. If this was really
! O'Neill's wish, William Janney ful
fills it perfectly. And so with several
other roles.
For commendation we may single
! out Lex Lindsay, who restrained
'quite neatly an easily burlesqued
"bit" of a college boy, and Martha
i Mayo, who more nearly achieved a
I complete characterization than any
! other member of the cast. For cen-
I sure, Ralph M. Remley, who over
! played his drunk scene, one of the
few genuine comedy scenes of the
i play, and Jay Ward, who was worse
! than is permissable even for a child
I actor.
To a Rogers fan, this show may
be recommended, since it provides
j an opportunity for the neophyte to
i see the idol at close range, doing
i just the things which have made him
|an idol. To anyone else, the per
; formance will probably prove rather
boring. —Benet
