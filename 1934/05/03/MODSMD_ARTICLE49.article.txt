# Cards, Trojans Rated Equal in Pre-Meet Dope
## TRACK AND FIELD SQUAD, 28 STRONG, READY FOR U.S.C. Broken Arm Keeps Meier Out of Competition 
### JACK DROWN 
Twenty-eight strong, Coach Dink
Templeton's track and field war
riors hoard a special train tomor
row evening bound for Los Ange
les, where Saturday afternoon in
Ihe Olympic Stadium they will meet
Dean Cromwell's Southern Califor
nia spiked-shoe artists in the annual
Card-Trojan dual track fest.
This year's contest promises to be
a classic. Last Saturday, after Cap
tain Gus Meier, ace Card hurdler,
was carried from the track with a
broken arm not to compete again
this season, the customary Stan
ford Cardinal was replaced with a
funeral black and there was much
wailing and moaning, because it
appeared that without Gus, Stan
ford's chances of defeating El Tro
jan were very remote indeed.
Doped as Even Bet
As the week has progressed, how
over, Stanford has come from a
position of underdog to no worse
than an even bet and many track
experts and dopesters are giving
Templeton's boys the meet, some by
a narrow margin, others by quite
a wide margin.
One reason for this recent feeling
of optimism is that the predicters
seem to be believers in that old
saying, "History repeats itself."
Last year under identical condi
tions, their Captain Ben Eastman out
with a muscle injury, Stanford's
stalwarts defeated Troy 67 to 64
in one of the most glorious victories
in the history of Card track. There
were plenty of come-through boys
on that momentous day and the so
called authorities are banking on a
like display of form this Saturday.
But one important factor distin
guishes this season's meet from
last's. In the 1933 win, Indian com
petitors competed way over their
heads and some didn't attain those
heights again That season.
Saturday, if Templeton's boys per
form as they are capable of doing,
last Saturday's great performances
of sprinter Jimmy Willson, broad
jumper Phil Williams, and half-mi
ler Bill Sorenson all being encour
aging factors, spectators at Satur
day's meet very likely will see the
Stanford Indian overpowering the
Southern California Trojan.

Stanford is conceded plenty of
points in the weights. Lyman,
Dunn, and perhaps Bob Reynolds, if
he puts them out as he can in prac
tice, could very possibly sweep the
shot put, but the Cards are a cinch
to take first and second.
The discus, with Dunn and Lyman
again, assures the Indians of another
eight points, while reliable Johnny
Mottram, who remains unbeaten
this season, will win the javelin
without difficulty from the South
erners. Stanford possibly will gar
ner a second here, also, with Dud
