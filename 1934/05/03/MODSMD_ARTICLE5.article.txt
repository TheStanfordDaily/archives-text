lute power of recall, initiative, and
referendum. It is the most effective
check that can be devised to re
strain unwished-for expressions of
centralized control.
"Because of this effective check,
students have, I think, any
that their liberties will be lost are
groundless. Vote yes."
Crompton Bangs: "We think that
we have corrected the things which
caused the defeat of the previous
proposed Constitution.
"No campus organization need fear
the power of an entrenched Exec

Constitution."
Donn Taium: "The revised Con

individual settlement certain specific
and localized controversies which
are not important in devising a
tem of student government and
which therefore should not be set
tled in the terms of this Constitution.
"Therefore, we solicit unified cam
pus support."
