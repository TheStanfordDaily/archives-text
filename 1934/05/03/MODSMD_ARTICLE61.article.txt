## 
### 
LOUISVILLE, Ky, May 2 MP).â€”
On the ground that the bituminous
coal code is unconstitutional as ap
plied to local business, Federal Dis
trict Judge Charles I. Dawson today
temporarily restrained the govern
ment from forcing the code upon
unwilling operators in Western Ken
tucky. He set May 11 for a hearing
on a permanent injunction.

After much arguing, a co-ed at the
University of Minnesota was induced
to take off her shoes in order to re
duce her height advantage over her
escort.
