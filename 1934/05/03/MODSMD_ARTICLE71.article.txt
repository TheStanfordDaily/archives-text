ALL-CONFERENCE
BALL TEAM
As usual with all—this and that
selections, the first all-conference
baseball team to come to our atten
tion, picked by Tom Foudy, East
Bay sports critic, brings plenty of
gripes from this corner.
Foudy selected Bill Peterson, Cali
fornia; Stan Anderson, Stanford;!
and Jim Appleby, U.S.C., as pitch
ers and Jim Massey, Stanford
catcher, to complete the battery. In
his infield were Holbrook and De
deaux of U.S.C. at first and second,
and Hallauer and Thompson of the
Bears at short and third, respect
ively. Relies and Sparling, also of
California, were in the outfied along
with George Wilson, St. Mary's.
No particular fault can be found
with the battery. Massey was the :
only catcher in the league to hold
down a first-string job throughout,
the year, although Barreiles and!
Owens, both of St. Mary's, were
right up with the best. Peterson;
was the league's leading hurler, An- i
derson was effective, and Appleby
probably had a slight edge over
"Lefty" Hardt of California as the
best portsider in the conference.
If only three pitchers are to be '
included, these three undoubtedly '
had the best records, but in our :
opinion Fred Heringer of the In
dians cannot justly be left off. Be- |
cause of the fact that he was forced I
to do much relief work, going into
the game in tight situations, his-won
and lost record is not so impressive
but nevertheless he was one of the
most effective pitchers in the C.1.8.A.
NUTTING, MORROW
LEFT OUT
The biggest criticism we can level

at this team is the ommission of |
Mort Nutting, Stanford, and John J
Morrow, U.S.C., from the outfield. I
Nutting and Morrow were without '
peers in flychasing and both hit well, i
having averages over .300. Relies, :
with his better than .400 average, j
cannot be left off Ihe team. Wilson, J
also a great hitter, would get the |
utility job and "Tex" Stewart should
be mentioned for his great fielding, i
Holbrook was given the call over
Hearn of Stanford and Grilk of Cal- !
ifornia for the first base job but both J
of the latter rate over the Trojan in j
our opinion, with Hearn getting the j
edge because of his higher batting ;
average.
Rod Dedeaux was shifted from j
short, his usual position, to second j
and Hallauer installed at shortstop. I
Little fault can be found with this j
selection, but we would give the j
third base position to Bob Allaire.
Trojan captain, over Del Thompson. !
OUII ALL-CONFERENCE
BALL TEAM
To sum up, our team would be
made of Massey, catcher; Peterson, |
Anderson, Heringer, and Appleby, I
pitchers; Hearn, first; Dedeaux, sec
ond; Allaire, third; Hallauer, short;
and Morrow, Nutting, and Relies
in the outfield with Wilson as utility.
Baseball interest which took a
slight turn for the better this year
should be greatly increased next :
year. In the first place, the race for '
the conference crown will probably ;
be much closer than it has been for j
the past two years. Also the re-en- j
trance to the league of U.C.L.A. and j
possibly Santa Clara and the pos- ;
sible addition of Loyola will make j
for more varied schedules and more i
interest. —Tremaine
