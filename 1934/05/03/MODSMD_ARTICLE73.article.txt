# Wilbur Declares Faith In Younger Generation

### 
Stating that he doubted whether
there was "ever a time when our
boys and girls were more promising
than they are todayâ€”even though
they must overcome external con
ditions that try them as with fire,"
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur went on to
say, in his speech Tuesday before
the California Congress of Parents
and Teachers in Sacramento, that
out of this belief in the children of
today, and the hope for them, lias
come the White House Conference
of Child Health and Protection.
President Wilbur continued that
since all are not "equally endowed
to take advantage" of the rights of
equality guaranteed by our consti
tution, we must offer in our schools
"free scope to those who can move
out in front and find new ways to
progress."'
