# STUDENTS VOTE ON CONSTITUTION AT POLLS TODAY
## Campus Political Leaders Withdraw All Organized Opposition; Two-Thirds Margin Necessary For Immediate Adoption 
### 
With the polls opening at 8:30 o'clock on the Law steps this morning the
proposed A.S.S.U. Constitution goes before a student vote. Requiring a
two-thirds margin in order to be adopted, the new Constitution will go
into effect immediately if accepted by the voters.
Though not assured of the necessary vote, the Constitution faces no

organized opposition, and student"
politicos are expecting it to pass.
Satisfied with the Constitution are
most of the groups antagonistic to
the previous revision.
Support Work
Representing the minor sports
group, Jim Triolo and Wadsworth
White support the Constitution in
the following statements:
Jim Triolo, water polo forward
and yell leader: - "It seems to me
that in the newly proposed A.S.S.U.
Constitution we have a document
which is undoubtedly superior to
the one by which we are now gov
erned. The small flaws, if any, which
special interest groups might find in
this Constitution should be over
looked in an effort to realize the
value of the document as a whole."
Wadsworth White, soccer captain:
"The Constitution-to-be will be ac
cepted today on the grounds that it
is as fine a collection of workable
progressive compromises as the Con
stitution which rules our fair land."
Kahn in Favor
Howard Moore, who previously
opposed the Constitution due to pro
visions which have now been
changed, says: "Reports of my criti
cism have been grossly exaggerated.
I will not ding the Constitution."
Marvie Kahn, intramural manager
and Hall political chieftain, says:
"The Constitutional Revision Com
mittee has done creditable work in
correcting the numerous ambiguities
that existed in the old Constitution.
Means have been provided for the
evolution of a fine student govern
ment under proper guidance of
thinking student leaders."
Johnny Mottram, junior member
of Ex Committee: "The second re
vised Constitution is a vast improve
ment over the old, and the several
difficulties seen in the first draft
seem to be all ironed out. Bangs,
Denny, Mellinkoff, Fullenwider, and
Tatum are deserving of the greatest
appreciation for the time and effort
they have expended."
Women Approve
Elinor Kahn, adviser of the Revi
sion Committee on the women's pro
visions, says: "In their attempt not
only to placate the various campus
factions but also to revise the Con
stitution so that it would meet with
the approval of the Student Body,
the Constitution Revision Committee
has attempted to secure a practical
plan for co-operative student gov
ernment at Stanford."
Joe Chamberlain announces the
polls will be open from 8:30 continu
ously until 2 o'clock. The Election
Committee will meet in Room 240
after the election to count the re
sults. He urges students to be sure
to follow the instructions at the .top
of the ballot. Forty ballots were
thrown out as invalid at the last
election because of this. Students
must mark "X" in ink in the proper
place, and not "yes" or "no."
