# Sororities To Stay As Vote Defeats Halls
## Rushing Rules, Proportion Of Row Women Cited As Main Objections 319 Visit Polls, Resulting In 216 For, 103 Against 
### 
With nearly twice as many Greek
as Hall women voting, abolition of
sororities on the campus was de
feated at yesterday's poll. Of the
319 women voting, 216 stated prefer
ence for the present system as com
pared with the 103 who favored a
non-sorority University.
Existing rushing rules and altered
proportion of women, were indicated
as the primary objections of the
present plan by Row women, while
Hall residents attributed the diffi
culty to the existence of selective
groups on the campus.
More Sororities
Increase in the number of houses,
continuation of the present system,
abolition of selective living groups,
and administration of all units by
the University received about equal
scores in the votes.
Study of the ballots showed that
non-affiliated women almost unani
mously favored the University ad
ministered living quarters. Greek
member votes were divided between
the present system and the plap to
increase the number of sororities.
Winter Rushing
Winter quarter of the freshman
year is the favorite rushing season
of both factions, as was also the sug
gestion of less restriction of "nor
mal contact." A longer period of
rushing was universally disliked.
Bidding by sororities and preferen
tial lists submitted by both freshmen
and rushing groups received a votÂ£
difference of only two.
A separate vote by sponsors
showed an anti-sorority feeling.
They believe the sorority groupings
to be the chief objection with the
existing social relationships on the
campus and balloted for University
controlled units. Sympathy with the
difficulties of new women was shown
in their favoring the plan of prefer
ential listing by both the rushees and
the sororities for bidding arrange
ments.
