# TRACKMEN HAVE CHANCE TO WIN FROM TROJANS
## Willson and Thorns Figured to Place in Sprints; Klopstock, Blackman, Williams, Zaches, Nimmo May Take First Places 
### JACK DROWN 
Tomorrow afternoon on the floor of Olympic Stadium in Los Angeles.
Stanford's undefeated track team faces Southern California's aggregation,
also unbeaten this season, in what should prove to be the classic duel track
and field meet on the Coast this year.

• Most dopesters rate tomorrow's
| affair a toss-up, but Stanford can
| win, if the boys come through as
they are capable, and many enthu
i siastic Card backers are running
1 about with their dope sheets to give
proof to their claims. The Daily's
| track writer's prediction gives Stan
\ ford the meet by a 69-62 score,
! without giving either team all of the
| breaks.

Stanford bases its claims for points
in these contests on Jimmy Willson
and Carlton Thorns in the 100-yard
affair, the boys having respective
marks of 9.8 and 9.9, and upon Al
Blackman and Carlton Thorns in the
220, both having run close to 21.4.
Although Foy Draper of S.C. is
favored to win both, the Cards
should do no worse than to take two
seconds and a third unless the men
of Troy go absolutely wild.
Blackman Favored
As far as the 440 is concerned,
Blackman will have his hands full
withstanding the challenges of Tro
jan's McCarthy, Tompkins, and Ab
lowich.
Bud Deacon is conceded the pole
vault, thus giving Stanford five
points, but the other places are sub
ject to dispute.
Ame Anderson scored over 13 feet
twice on Wednesday, only to injure
his ankle rather severely on his sec r
ond effort. If his injury heals in
time for his vaulting tomorrow, a
fact which is rather doubtful, the
Indians should chalk up a second, a>
S.C.'s Findley and Lindsey are not
capable of any such height. The third
Card competitor, Jack Geer, has been
showing considerable form of late
and may surprise for a place, but
with Anderson out, the Trojans will
probably cop second and third.
Hurdles Close
With Captain Meier out of the
meet, the task of representing Stan
ford in the hurdles falls upon the
very capable shoulders of Sam Klop
stock. Sam faces no mean task in
either the highs or the lows, but
Sam's mark of 14.5 for the 120-yard
distance made in the Big Meet
against the wind establishes him as
the favorite to win over Lyon in this
event.
The lows, however, present a very
different story. Hall of the South
