# TRACKMEN HAVE CHANCE TO WIN FROM TROJANS
## Willson and Thorns Figured to Place in Sprints; Klopstock, Blackman, Williams, Zaches, Nimmo May Take First Places 
### JACK DROWN 
Tomorrow afternoon on the floor of Olympic Stadium in Los Angeles.
Stanford's undefeated track team faces Southern California's aggregation,
also unbeaten this season, in what should prove to be the classic duel track
and field meet on the Coast this year.

• Most dopesters rate tomorrow's
| affair a toss-up, but Stanford can
| win, if the boys come through as
they are capable, and many enthu
i siastic Card backers are running
1 about with their dope sheets to give
proof to their claims. The Daily's
| track writer's prediction gives Stan
\ ford the meet by a 69-62 score,
! without giving either team all of the
| breaks.

Stanford bases its claims for points
in these contests on Jimmy Willson
and Carlton Thorns in the 100-yard
affair, the boys having respective
marks of 9.8 and 9.9, and upon Al
Blackman and Carlton Thorns in the
220, both having run close to 21.4.
Although Foy Draper of S.C. is
favored to win both, the Cards
should do no worse than to take two
seconds and a third unless the men
of Troy go absolutely wild.
Blackman Favored
As far as the 440 is concerned,
Blackman will have his hands full
withstanding the challenges of Tro
jan's McCarthy, Tompkins, and Ab
lowich.
Bud Deacon is conceded the pole
vault, thus giving Stanford five
points, but the other places are sub
ject to dispute.
Ame Anderson scored over 13 feet
twice on Wednesday, only to injure
his ankle rather severely on his sec r
ond effort. If his injury heals in
time for his vaulting tomorrow, a
fact which is rather doubtful, the
Indians should chalk up a second, a>
S.C.'s Findley and Lindsey are not
capable of any such height. The third
Card competitor, Jack Geer, has been
showing considerable form of late
and may surprise for a place, but
with Anderson out, the Trojans will
probably cop second and third.
Hurdles Close
With Captain Meier out of the
meet, the task of representing Stan
ford in the hurdles falls upon the
very capable shoulders of Sam Klop
stock. Sam faces no mean task in
either the highs or the lows, but
Sam's mark of 14.5 for the 120-yard
distance made in the Big Meet
against the wind establishes him as
the favorite to win over Lyon in this
event.
The lows, however, present a very
different story. Hall of the South
! erners has traversed the 220-yard
j canter in 23.8 seconds, while Sam's
best mark is 24 flat. It loolcs like
j little Sam can get no better than
i second here.
Ninmio Runs Mile
i The mile ought to be a Nimmo
victory, but Chuck will have to step
] plenty lively if he beats his old prep
j school nemesis, Benevidpz, to the
tape. Nimmo will also run the half
I and has an outside chance of taking
I the Trojan's Estel Johnson.
I If Howie Arthur and Lloyd
| Schween leap as they are able to,
j Stanford will take at least two places
I in the high jump in spite of el Tro
! jan's Will Brannan and Spicer. Ar
| thur cleared over 6 feet 5 inches to
' win the National A.A.U. champlon
| ship several years ago, and Schween
I made the best effort of his life in
last year's Stanford-S.C. meet to fly
i over t> feet 4 inches.
Jumps Doubtful
The broad jump presents Phil Wil
! liams and Paul Zaches, premier ln
j dian performers, who came through
j so nobly last year to take first and
. second, both going near the 24 feet
marker. McFadden of the Southern
i ers will be quite an obstacle tomor
[ row, but one of Templeton's boys
; ought to take him and the other
| should garner a third if they equal
1 their season's best marks.
Lyman and Dunn are certainties
| to place one-two in the shot unless
one of the big fellows breaks an arm.
Dunn Favored
Dunn should'win the discus with
out much trouble with Lyman ex
tending himself a bit to beat Troy's
! Carpenter out of second.
These two fellows should give the
Cards the neat little sum of 18 points
and those together with the cinch
five contributed by javelin throwing
i Johnny Mottram, probably the best
I spear heaver in the U.S. today and a
! threat to the Finns' Olympic domi
j nation in the event, will give the
! Cards the necessary points to win,
if the rest of Templeton's boys pro
j duce the goods.

Jumps Doubtful
The broad jump presents Phil Wil

Cards the neat little sum of 18 points

Tomorrow afternoon on the floor of Olympic Stadium in Los Angeles.
Stanford's undefeated track team faces Southern California's aggregation,
also unbeaten this season, in what should prove to be the classic duel track
and field meet on the Coast this year.

• Most dopesters rate tomorrow's
| affair a toss-up, but Stanford can
| win, if the boys come through as
they are capable, and many enthu
i siastic Card backers are running
1 about with their dope sheets to give
proof to their claims. The Daily's
| track writer's prediction gives Stan
\ ford the meet by a 69-62 score,
! without giving either team all of the
| breaks.

Stanford bases its claims for points
in these contests on Jimmy Willson
and Carlton Thorns in the 100-yard
affair, the boys having respective
marks of 9.8 and 9.9, and upon Al
Blackman and Carlton Thorns in the
220, both having run close to 21.4.
Although Foy Draper of S.C. is
favored to win both, the Cards
should do no worse than to take two
seconds and a third unless the men
of Troy go absolutely wild.
Blackman Favored
As far as the 440 is concerned,
Blackman will have his hands full
withstanding the challenges of Tro
jan's McCarthy, Tompkins, and Ab
lowich.
Bud Deacon is conceded the pole
vault, thus giving Stanford five
points, but the other places are sub
ject to dispute.
Ame Anderson scored over 13 feet
twice on Wednesday, only to injure
his ankle rather severely on his sec r
ond effort. If his injury heals in
time for his vaulting tomorrow, a
fact which is rather doubtful, the
Indians should chalk up a second, a>
S.C.'s Findley and Lindsey are not
capable of any such height. The third
Card competitor, Jack Geer, has been
showing considerable form of late
and may surprise for a place, but
with Anderson out, the Trojans will
probably cop second and third.
Hurdles Close
With Captain Meier out of the
meet, the task of representing Stan
ford in the hurdles falls upon the
very capable shoulders of Sam Klop
stock. Sam faces no mean task in
either the highs or the lows, but
Sam's mark of 14.5 for the 120-yard
distance made in the Big Meet
against the wind establishes him as
the favorite to win over Lyon in this
event.
The lows, however, present a very
different story. Hall of the South
! erners has traversed the 220-yard
j canter in 23.8 seconds, while Sam's
best mark is 24 flat. It loolcs like
j little Sam can get no better than
i second here.
Ninmio Runs Mile

Blackman will have his hands full
withstanding the challenges of Tro
jan's McCarthy, Tompkins, and Ab
lowich.
Bud Deacon is conceded the pole
vault, thus giving Stanford five
points, but the other places are sub
ject to dispute.
Ame Anderson scored over 13 feet
twice on Wednesday, only to injure
his ankle rather severely on his sec r
ond effort. If his injury heals in
time for his vaulting tomorrow, a
fact which is rather doubtful, the
Indians should chalk up a second, a>
S.C.'s Findley and Lindsey are not
capable of any such height. The third
Card competitor, Jack Geer, has been
showing considerable form of late
and may surprise for a place, but
with Anderson out, the Trojans will
probably cop second and third.
Hurdles Close
With Captain Meier out of the
meet, the task of representing Stan
ford in the hurdles falls upon the
very capable shoulders of Sam Klop
stock. Sam faces no mean task in
either the highs or the lows, but
Sam's mark of 14.5 for the 120-yard
distance made in the Big Meet
against the wind establishes him as
the favorite to win over Lyon in this
event.
The lows, however, present a very
different story. Hall of the South
! erners has traversed the 220-yard
j canter in 23.8 seconds, while Sam's
best mark is 24 flat. It loolcs like
j little Sam can get no better than
i second here.
Ninmio Runs Mile
i The mile ought to be a Nimmo
victory, but Chuck will have to step
] plenty lively if he beats his old prep
j school nemesis, Benevidpz, to the
tape. Nimmo will also run the half
I and has an outside chance of taking
I the Trojan's Estel Johnson.
I If Howie Arthur and Lloyd
| Schween leap as they are able to,
j Stanford will take at least two places
I in the high jump in spite of el Tro
! jan's Will Brannan and Spicer. Ar
| thur cleared over 6 feet 5 inches to
' win the National A.A.U. champlon
| ship several years ago, and Schween
I made the best effort of his life in
last year's Stanford-S.C. meet to fly
i over t> feet 4 inches.
Jumps Doubtful
The broad jump presents Phil Wil
! liams and Paul Zaches, premier ln
j dian performers, who came through
j so nobly last year to take first and
. second, both going near the 24 feet
marker. McFadden of the Southern
i ers will be quite an obstacle tomor
[ row, but one of Templeton's boys
; ought to take him and the other
| should garner a third if they equal
1 their season's best marks.
Lyman and Dunn are certainties
| to place one-two in the shot unless
one of the big fellows breaks an arm.
Dunn Favored
Dunn should'win the discus with
out much trouble with Lyman ex
tending himself a bit to beat Troy's
! Carpenter out of second.
These two fellows should give the
Cards the neat little sum of 18 points
and those together with the cinch
five contributed by javelin throwing
i Johnny Mottram, probably the best
I spear heaver in the U.S. today and a
! threat to the Finns' Olympic domi
j nation in the event, will give the
! Cards the necessary points to win,
if the rest of Templeton's boys pro
j duce the goods.
Tomorrow afternoon on the floor of Olympic Stadium in Los Angeles.
Stanford's undefeated track team faces Southern California's aggregation,
also unbeaten this season, in what should prove to be the classic duel track
and field meet on the Coast this year.

• Most dopesters rate tomorrow's
| affair a toss-up, but Stanford can
| win, if the boys come through as
they are capable, and many enthu
i siastic Card backers are running
1 about with their dope sheets to give
proof to their claims. The Daily's
| track writer's prediction gives Stan
\ ford the meet by a 69-62 score,
! without giving either team all of the
| breaks.

Stanford bases its claims for points
in these contests on Jimmy Willson
and Carlton Thorns in the 100-yard
affair, the boys having respective
marks of 9.8 and 9.9, and upon Al
Blackman and Carlton Thorns in the
220, both having run close to 21.4.
Although Foy Draper of S.C. is
favored to win both, the Cards
should do no worse than to take two
seconds and a third unless the men
of Troy go absolutely wild.
