# DECIDE NOT TO SEND SQUAD TO EASTERN MEET
## Board Members Reiterate Announcement Made In February TO ENTER L.A. MEET Two Men May Go East On Benefit Funds 
### 
The Stanford Board of Athletic
Control will not send a team to the
IC4A track and field meet in Phila
delphia May 18 and 19, it was de
cided at a board meeting last night.
The decision reiterated a board
! announcement made in February,
j Several reasons were given for the
i E.A.C. action. The budget, it was
: shown, is too low at present to stand
i the expense, and the board probably
j would be compelled to borrow
| money to sponsor an Indian team in
I the national meet.
N.C.A.A. Important
Also, it was brought out that the
N.C.A.A. meet to be held in Los An
' geles several weeks after the Fhila
i delphia engagement is more impor
i tant, in the minds of B.A.C. members,
J than is the IC4A.
There remains a possibility that
j one or two men may make the trip,
j Skull and Snakes has collected
i $438.75, originally intended to sup
| plement B.A.C. contributions in the
! event the board voted to send a team,
| It was not decided last night what
| will be done with this money, and
j A1 Blackman, acting head of the
| men's honorary fraternity in the ab
j sence of Gus Meier, could not be
| contacted for a statement.
Unofficial sources hinted that the
University of California may with
draw its entries as a result of the
Stanford action. The Bears had con
templated sending three men to the
meet. Early this week the Univer
sity of Southern California an-
I nounced it would not send a team.

| For the first time in 10 years west
' ern domination in the meet will not
ibe felt. Except for the 1924 meet,
\ which was won by Yale, one of the
! three California major universities
| have won every contest since 1921.
California started the parade by
winning the 1921, 1922, and 1923
meets. Troy was victorious in 192.)
