# Beans Donated For Monday's Charity Lunch
## King City Growers Ship Big Supply of Food For "Banquet" 
### 
Free beans for the campus Mon
day! This enlightening phrase be
came an actuality yesterday, when
it was announced that 1,000 pounds
of the Spanish national food arrived
here for Monday's Convalescent
luncheons.
Through the generosity of Ihe
Chamber of Commerce of King City,
the immense load of beans will be
available at the co-operative store j
today. The Co-op will deliver one )
10-pound package of beans to each j
fraternity, sorority, and eating club !
on the campus in time for the Bean j
Day lunch.
Started Last Year
Bean Day luncheon was started !
for the first time last year by Cap- !
tain Ike Livermore of the 1933 base- i
ball team. His first famous mottc. j
"Beans for Babies, Baseball Players j
for Beans," is repeated this Monday ]
but it includes every activity on the i
campus, not only baseball players.

This year's Bean Day will be a
bigger affair than last year's since
the Row and the clubs will not even
have to purchase their bean sup- j
plies. Individual contributions from ;
each group should be that much
larger. It is estimated that the cost
per person this year will amount to
only six cents per plate, the re- j
mainder to go to charity.
Menu Suggested
The typical lunch suggested by
Convalescent Drive authorities for
campus digestion Monday consists j
of beans, French bread, apples or j
plain lettuce salad. Some of the j
houses and more fastidious groups j
i plan to serve iced tea with the above
menu, although this is additional.
There is a bean menu, prepared j
by Sam McDonald, famous Stanford
ground keeper and barbecue expert,
' which has been used on the farm
| since 1903. It is designed to prepare
j five gallons of beans, but managers i
i are warned that 10 pounds of beans
I will be given the eating groups, nn<4 !
I so the recipe may be rationed ac- j
cordingly. Here it is:
Sam's Recipe
Five gallons beans, two cups suga t *, !
; two pounds of salt pork, two pounds
! of onions, salt, pepper. Soak beans
| for 12 hours in water, add ingre
; dients, and bake. Don't stir.
Next Wednesday night an all-Uni
j versity jolly-up has been planned as j
1 part of Convalescent week drive. It
j will last from 7 to 9 o'clock, location
| to be announced Monday. Thus far,
i unusual musical talent has been re
-1 cruited for the affair.
