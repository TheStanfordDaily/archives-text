That the question of the. future status of sororities at
Stanford did not become tiie all-important and prevailing
interest of campus women despite the many efforts of both
factions to make it so was clearly shown in yesterday's
vole when only about three-eighths of the women bothered
to go to the polls to express their opinions on the matter.
The lack of interest is unfortunate when women lead
ers have gone to much trouble in a sincere effort to pro
vide for the happiness of future generations of Stanford
women in their living group arrangements.
Hut even now some constructive result of the investiga
tion may be achieved, if students and administration, not
ing the fact that both Row and Hall women consider the
present rushing system an evil one, will co-operate in a
reorganization of that system to eliminate much of its arti
ficial i ty.
More natural contact between the new and old women
is desirable in the eyes of a majority of those who voted
yesterday.
It is the hope of the Daily that, going on this sugges
tion, the students and administrative powers will revise
the rushing system so that much of the forced sorority
consciousness of new women and their resultant nervous
ness and hysteria, accompanied by disappointments and
heartbreak because of the exaggerated importance of go
ing or not going Row, may be eliminated.
If this can be accomplished, the agitation and work of
the hist few months will not have been entirely in vain.
