# Lady Luck Rides Tomorrow
## 
### 
A determined group of 28 Stanford trackmen face an
equally serious outfit of Trojans in the latter's Los Ange
les camp tomorrow. Experts give both squads a fairly even
chance to come out on the long end of a very close score,
iiiid it seems to be anybody's meet, with every break count
ing.
Last week's loss of Captain Cms Meier, 011 the injured
list with a broken arm, has given every man the definite
idea of surpassing previous efforts in an attempt to do
away for good with the traditional "captain's jinx." Twen
lv-eight Stanford men are out to see the Trojans bite the
dust.
Ladv Luck rides swiftly tomorrow.
