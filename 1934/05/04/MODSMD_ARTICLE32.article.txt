Financial difficulties have made it impossible for the
Hoard of Athletic Control to send a representative track
and Held team to the 1.C.1-A., but Stanford can still hold

The sum of l.'W.7f>, which Skull and Snakes Society
gathered as Ihc result of its all-University meet on March

trip. Announcement of those men (or that man) should
act as some sort of a salve to heal the injured feelings of
a campus which could not see its hope fulfilled.
