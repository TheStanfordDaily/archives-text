## Dillinger — Evolution of a Public Enemy 
### CROMPTON BANGS Jr 
John Dillinger has already become (
a rather sinister legend. He is the |
nation's most hunted and most
wanted criminal. Yet less than a j
year ago he held up his first bank.
Seven months ago, he was unknown j
outside of Indiana. What accounts j
for his rapid rise in the world of j
crime?
Dillinger is thirty years old. He
spent twenty of these years in
Mooresville, Indiana helping his fa
ther on a farm and in a grocery
store. He finished grammar school,
but went no further. His teachers
said he was a good boy; so did his
lather.
An Amateur —Until
In 1924 Dillinger attempted to hold
up a local grocer. The crime was
amateurish; everybody recognized
everybody else. He got ten to
twenty years in the state reforma
tory.
This reformatory w a s over
crowded, as is the custom. Dillinger
was always in trouble; punishment
made him meaner than ever. In 1929
he was transferred to the state peni
lentiary along with several "friends"
he had made. In May, 1933, he was
released on parole at the request of
the Mooresville minister. During his
nine years in jail he had learned
plenty.
The Crime Wave
Last July, he robbed a small-town
hank in Indiana of $3,500: a friend

of his reformatory days helped him.
Two more robberies brought, in
825,000, but he was caught in neigh
boring Ohio and locked up in the Li
ma jail.
In the meantime, some of his
friends had broken out of the Indi
ana penitentiary; they got him out
of the Lima jail. A sheriff was killed
in the process, and Dillinger's name
appeared for the first time on the
front pages. What happened since
then is common knowledge.
Since then Dillinger and his gang
of friends from his prison days have
stolen about five million dollars;
their acts have resulted in killing
mx officers, six of their own men
and one bystander. Caught in Tus
con, Arizona and returned to Indi
j ana, he escaped because of the stu
j pidity of local officers. Federal
; agents are still looking.
Why?
Appar en 11 y Dillinger learned
1 everything he knows about crime in
I prison. Most of his accomplices
' were fellow prisoners. After nine
years in two jails, he proceeded to
commit crimes which must have
been well planned in advance.
Prisons arc supposed to reform the
prisoner. In this case, the Dillinger
of 1933 was a far more dangerous
enemy to society than the 1924 mo
del. The change took place in pri
son. Prisons do not seem to be doing
| what (he public expects of them.
