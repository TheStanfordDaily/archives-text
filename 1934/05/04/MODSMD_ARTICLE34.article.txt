IF I WERE FREE (RKO)
At the Varsity Theatre
The old tripe of ,the "Continental
attitude" Is dished out by Clive
Brook and Irene Dunne against the
attractive settings of Parisian cafes
and London country estates. Mutu
ally dissatisfied with life, Brook and
Dunne find companionship in each
other; the only obstacle is that he is
not free from a parasitic wife. Yet
with the exception of a short inter
ruption the amourous relationship
proceeds throughout the picture.
In spite of the triteness and in
feriority of the plot, Mr. Brook and
Miss Dunne manage to give finished
performances. It is the plot, non
chalant and leisurely moving—at
about the same tempo as Brook's
temperament —which is entirely aL
fault.
But as the quality of the acting is
sufficiently good to balance the me
diocrity of the story, the picture is
elevated to average rank.
LOOKING FOR TROUBLE
Another "comedy riot" falls flat.
Very flat. Jack Oakie and Spencer
Tracy in their usual character parts
make the best of a slow, dull, unin
teresting vehicle. As a result, they
turn in performances that are some
what true to form, although defi
nitely below par.
Oakie accuses every other person
in the case of having "no sense of
humoi"'; but in reality, it is the lines,
the plot which is lacking in humor.
Hence Oakie, who depends on gags,
has difficulty in scoring. There are
a few feeble bits of slapstick, but
they fail to draw a laugh.
The plot, slow in starting and con
sistently poor, begins to move about
the time that the final flash goes on
the screen. Within the last few min
utes, the love interest is endangered,
the principals are temporarily in
terred in a trap, a murder is com
mitted, and the Los Angeles earth
quake nearly sends the actors to ob
livion. —Mayer
If you like mysteries, you will en
joy the insouciant Robert Mont
gomery in "The Mystery of Mr. X,'
one-half of the current Fox Stanford
double bill. On the other hand, if
you are a confirmed Montgomery
fan, you also would do well to at
tend the program.
In this opus, he plays a gentleman
safe-cracker —in the usual distinc
tive Montgomery manner —who in
the end reforms, as you knew all
along he would, but not without be
coming complicated in a series of
policeman murders. It is definitely
above the average, as thrillers go.
The irrepressible Robert is at his
best in the informal atmosphere of
a bachelor kitchen; the heroine,
daughter of Scotland Yard commis
sioner, with one foot in the butter.
Best shot: the last flashlight photo
graph.
Elizabeth Allan, although handi
capped by bad makeup, is pleasing
in the feminine lead; Lewis Stone is
again capable.
"Harold Teen" is a not-too-judi
cious mixture of slapstick, melo
drama, and musical comedy. Hal
Leßoy as a leading man is a good
tap-dancer. Rochelle Hudson is a
decorative ingenue; the remainder
of the cast-, except for the Paul Lu
kas-like Snatcher, show a distressing
tendency to appear nearer 38 than
18. "How Do I Know It's Sunday '
and "Simple and Sweet" are Teen
melodies.
A typical excerpt, illustrating the
Teen brand of humor:
Do you like to dance with
French heels? '
"I don't know any."

Church to relegate Bishop Cannon

The irrepressible Robert is at his

"Harold Teen" is a not-too-judi

IF I WERE FREE (RKO)
At the Varsity Theatre
The old tripe of ,the "Continental
attitude" Is dished out by Clive
Brook and Irene Dunne against the
attractive settings of Parisian cafes
and London country estates. Mutu
ally dissatisfied with life, Brook and
Dunne find companionship in each
other; the only obstacle is that he is
not free from a parasitic wife. Yet
with the exception of a short inter
ruption the amourous relationship
proceeds throughout the picture.
In spite of the triteness and in
feriority of the plot, Mr. Brook and
Miss Dunne manage to give finished
performances. It is the plot, non
chalant and leisurely moving—at
about the same tempo as Brook's
temperament —which is entirely aL
fault.
But as the quality of the acting is
sufficiently good to balance the me
diocrity of the story, the picture is
elevated to average rank.
LOOKING FOR TROUBLE
Another "comedy riot" falls flat.
Very flat. Jack Oakie and Spencer
Tracy in their usual character parts
make the best of a slow, dull, unin
teresting vehicle. As a result, they
turn in performances that are some
what true to form, although defi
nitely below par.
Oakie accuses every other person
in the case of having "no sense of
humoi"'; but in reality, it is the lines,
the plot which is lacking in humor.
Hence Oakie, who depends on gags,
has difficulty in scoring. There are
a few feeble bits of slapstick, but
they fail to draw a laugh.
The plot, slow in starting and con
sistently poor, begins to move about
the time that the final flash goes on
the screen. Within the last few min
utes, the love interest is endangered,
the principals are temporarily in
terred in a trap, a murder is com
mitted, and the Los Angeles earth
