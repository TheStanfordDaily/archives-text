# BULL SESSION
## TWO FINK JOHNS: ROCKEFELLER AND DILLINGER 
### 
When John Dillinger goes to the
mountains for a little rest, he is
rooted out by rifle and machine-gun
fire. He is denounced in public, and
praised in private. In public he is
] "Enemy No. 1"; in private he is "a
damn clever gunman."
When John Rockefeller goes to his
estate in Florida for a little rest, the
1 roads nearby are closed to traffic,
( that "Neighbor John" might have
i more quiet. In public he is praised
("the 94-year-old philanthropist,"
says the A.P.); in private, there are
many who damn him as a robber.
|
Although neither of America's two
fine Johns would be flattered by the
comparison, Dillinger and Rockefel
ler are quite similar. Both are ex
perts at handling men. True, one
: handles men with bullets, the other
with dollars. But their results have
been closely parallel: wealth for
themselves; death for their adversa-
I ries. Both are men of courage; both
are men of action. Their philosophies
; have been simple: "if you want a
thing, just go ahead and grab."
! If these two men have had such
similar careers, it is somewhat sur
, prising that the public should vene
j rate one, %ind denounce the other.
Why is there such a difference in the

I estimation of the two men? We can
see but a few differences in the ca
, reers of the teammates in the great
American duet.
Rockefeller has been the modern
Robin Hood: he has robbed the poor
l to feed the rich. He has caused un
told misery and hardship. But, say
some, his ruthiessness has been
counterbalanced by his philanthropy.
However, if a man's good works are
to compensate for his sins, it would
I seem only right that the sinner
I should repent. John Rockefeller has
not repudiated his ruthiessness, nor
his mal-practice. John Rockefeller
has been a crooked capitalist, and
he is proud of it.
Dillinger is also proud of himself.
But if he has robbed, his robbery has
taken from the rich to feed and
[clothe the less rich; that is some
-1 what of an improvement.
Dillinger's activities have been
i more frank and open than Rocke-
I feller's. That is a big difference. But
results count. Both have gotten re
sults.
) The prime reason that one is con
demned and one lauded is that dol
lar ruthiessness is acceptable, and
bullet ruthiessness is not. Both are
I ruthless. —Dave Mellinkoff

Although neither of America's two
fine Johns would be flattered by the
comparison, Dillinger and Rockefel
ler are quite similar. Both are ex
perts at handling men. True, one
: handles men with bullets, the other
with dollars. But their results have
been closely parallel: wealth for
themselves; death for their adversa-
I ries. Both are men of courage; both
are men of action. Their philosophies
; have been simple: "if you want a
thing, just go ahead and grab."
! If these two men have had such
similar careers, it is somewhat sur
, prising that the public should vene
j rate one, %ind denounce the other.
Why is there such a difference in the

I estimation of the two men? We can
see but a few differences in the ca
, reers of the teammates in the great
American duet.
Rockefeller has been the modern
Robin Hood: he has robbed the poor
l to feed the rich. He has caused un
told misery and hardship. But, say
some, his ruthiessness has been
counterbalanced by his philanthropy.
However, if a man's good works are
to compensate for his sins, it would
I seem only right that the sinner
I should repent. John Rockefeller has
not repudiated his ruthiessness, nor
his mal-practice. John Rockefeller
has been a crooked capitalist, and
he is proud of it.
Dillinger is also proud of himself.
But if he has robbed, his robbery has
taken from the rich to feed and
[clothe the less rich; that is some
-1 what of an improvement.
Dillinger's activities have been
i more frank and open than Rocke-
I feller's. That is a big difference. But
results count. Both have gotten re
sults.
) The prime reason that one is con
demned and one lauded is that dol
lar ruthiessness is acceptable, and
bullet ruthiessness is not. Both are
I ruthless. —Dave Mellinkoff
When John Dillinger goes to the
mountains for a little rest, he is
rooted out by rifle and machine-gun
fire. He is denounced in public, and
praised in private. In public he is
] "Enemy No. 1"; in private he is "a
damn clever gunman."
When John Rockefeller goes to his
estate in Florida for a little rest, the
1 roads nearby are closed to traffic,
( that "Neighbor John" might have
i more quiet. In public he is praised
("the 94-year-old philanthropist,"
says the A.P.); in private, there are
many who damn him as a robber.
