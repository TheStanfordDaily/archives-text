TOUCH ONE
TO DOPE
This meet down in Los Angeles to
morrow which brings Southern Cal
ifornia's Trojan and Stanford's In
dians together again is probably the
toughest one of the year to figure
out. in advance. Before the injury to
Captain Gus Meier, it was compara
tively simple to predict a Stanford
victory by a slight margin.
After Meier broke bis arm last
Saturday and apparently took from
.six to 10 points from the Cardinal
score, it was just as easy to predict
a Trojan victory. Hut developments
in the past week and the spirit
shown by a Stanford team have
been such as (o swing the balance
hack to the Indians' favor.
Up until the last week, it has been
looked on as almost a certainty that
U.S.C. would lake the majority of
the points in the sprints if not score
sweeps in them. However, the rapid
improvement of Jimmy Willson, the
introduction of Blackman to the 220,
and the rounding into shape of Carl
Thoms gives Stanford a great chance
to break into the Trojan sprint mo
nopoly. even to take the majority of
points.
ONLY FIVE
FIRSTS SURE
Only five first places can be looked
on as sure-fire. Mottram should have
little trouble in the javelin, Deacon
should take the pole vault easily,
and Lyman will face little opposi
tion in the shot on the Stanford side
of the ledger. For U.S.C. Lantz and
Winn are almost certain to run one,
two in the two-mile while the Tro
jan relay team is apparently a cinch.
In the sprints, Draper, Thorns,
Willson, Parsons, "and Abbott in the
100 and Parsons, Blackman, Thorns,
Draper, and Fitch in the 220 all have
a chance of breaking into the scor
ing picture with the first three named
in each ease being favored in that
order.
The prettiest race of the day
should come early in the meet when
Blackman and McCarthy tangle in
the '140 which will be run around
two turns, the first 220 in lanes from
a staggered start, which is unusual
in this day but a necessity due to the
layout of the Coliseum. Blackmnn
is a slight favorite, but if Cromwell
sends Fitch or Parsons out to pace
McCarthy for the first 180 yards as
he did against U.C.L.A., McCarthy
might win if he sticks to his pace.
Parsons was to pace him against
LuValle, but McCarthy forgot to
stay with him while the Uclan stuck
right behind him, piling up an eight
yard lead which the Trojan couldn't
overcome.
SALES, /INDKRSON
COME UP
Dud Sales, recovering from an in
jury, threw the javelin the other
night for the first time in several
months and reached 180 feet, which
makes him a possibility to squeeze
into the money. Joy and gloom fol
lowed each other in rapid order the
other night at Angell Field when
Arne Anderson cleared 13 feet in the
pole vault with ease and then turned
ins ankle and wound up on crutches.
If he is able to compete he should
score also.
Chuck Nimmo. A1 Blackman, and
Sam Kloptock are the men who arc
counted on for two placcs. Nimmo
should be able to take the mile from
Benavidez and if he does and the In
dians score a few points in the cen
tury, Stanford will be off to a flying
start and nothing should stop them.
Half an hour later*he should run
second to Johnson in the BXO. Black
man is out to take first in the 140 and
a second in the 220.
Sammy Klopstock, Stanford's ace
in-the-hole with Meier out, is capa
ble of first in both hurdles, although
Hall, with a 23.8 low hurdle race,
has a better record i.han Kloppy's 24
fiat best in the Cal.
LYMAN, DUNN
SCORE IN WEIGHTS
Lyman and Dunn should roll up
14 to 16 points in the weights with
Harper good for a third in the shot
and Carpenter a second or third in
the discus. However, Carpenter a
148-foot thrower, might upset the
dope for a first if Dunn and Lyman
are slightly off.
The two jumps arc toss-ups. Ar
thur and Schween might score eight
points in the high jump or be limited
to one by Troy's Brannan and Spicer
and the same thing might happen in
the broad jump with Williams and
/aches of the Indians and McFadden,
Junkkeit, and Olson of U.S.C.
