# Poloists Will Meet San Mateo Tomorrow
## COMING GAME WILL BRING TOP-NOTCH TEAMS TOGETHER Fullerton, Rogers, Luppen Rasmussen Will Start 
### 
! Stanford and San Mateo Country
Club poloists will meet tomorrow
{ afternoon at 3 o'clock on the High
way Field in what critics say should
be the highlight of local sporting
j events this week-end as well as the
j best played and hardest-fought bat
! tie of mallet wielders seen here for
I years.
Cfaptain Richard Gordan, coach of
â–  the Redshirt four, is responsible for
! the superlatives used. That he is
| justified in employing them is easily
j shown when the relative merits of
, the two teams are considered.
Tcvis With San Mateo
The San Mateo riders will be cap
tained by Will Tevis, Jr., foremost
horseman on the peninsula, and with
him will be Bill Gilmor and prob
j ably McGee and Mosley, all of whom
j are high goal men.
Lupe Luppen, Russ Rasmussen,
I Bob Fullerton, and Bill Rogers are
! the four Stanford riders composing
i the first string, and will appear for
the first time this quarter on the
campus. Under Gordan's tutelage
these men have developed this year
into a team who have defeated at
least once every team they have rid
den against.
Last month these same two teams
met at the Beresford Field in San
| Mateo. Close games resulted each
I time, the Card riders coming out on
j top the first time, 10 to 8, and losing
: the second, 6 to 7. Tomorrow's game
| will be the playoff of the series.
Enemark, Burns Good
Bill Enemark and Frank Burns,
\ because of the good showing they
made last week in games against
Oregon State, have been chosen as
substitutes, and may both play. The
chances are, however, that the first
string will play during the entire
game.
Following tomorrow's game, the
Stanford team will travel South io
meet the championship Arizona
riders in Los Angeles in the fourth
j game the two teams will have played
this year, the Redshirts having lost
' the first and won the following two.
Those interested in seeing good
polo will not want to miss tomor
row's game. The game starts at 3
o'clock, and the admission will be
25 cents to students, 40 cents to out
! siders.
