# L.A.A.C., STANFORD MEET IN AQUATIC TILTS NEXT WEEK
## 
### 
Two different systems of play will
, be matched against each other as
Stanford and the Los Angeles Ath
letic Club meet in next week's Coast
championship water polo series.
The three-game series, to be
played here next Friday and Satur
j day, is a part of the Convalescent
Home Drive.
Los Angeles uses the American
system of play, while Stanford uses
the Hungarian system. In the 1932
Olympic Games, the American sys
tem was barely nosed out in the
finals by the powerful Hungarian
i type of game. The Los Angeles squad
! represented America in the Olym
pics.
The American system features a
long parsing attack. One or two for
j wards, in the case of L.A.A.C. two,
: take up positions in front of the
goal. The remaining five players
feed the ball to this player in the
I "hole."
| The forward that receives the pass
! then either tries to put the ball into
I the goal or to break away from the
I guard for a shot at the cage.
The chief advantage of the Amer
! ican system is the lightning-like
suddenness of attack. However, un
less the forward is superior to the
: opposing guard he will be smothered
and never receive a shot at the goal,
j The Hungarian offensive, on the
i other hand, features a fast-breaking,
l short-passing, six-man attack. The
' guards continually break away from
the opposing forwards, receive short
passes and dribble down the tank.
In the Hungarian system, every
, man on the team, with the excep
i tion of the goalie, is a potential
I scorer.
The Hungarian type of play is
i more sensational and opens the game
up, thus producing more excitement
for the fans. It calls for better phys
i ical condition because the men are
j constantly on the move. It also de

mands more ability at handling and j
passing the ball than does the Amer
ican system.
Because of a man-for-man supe- ,
riority, the Los Angeles American >
system triumphed over a smooth ;
Stanford Hungarian system last year. 1
