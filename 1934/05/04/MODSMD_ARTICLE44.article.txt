# DIEDRICH, EDMONDS WIN CUPS IN PING PONG TOURNAMENT
## 
### 
Tired and bleary-eyed after chas-
ing the elusive celluloid ball far into
the night, Margaret Diedrich of Ro
ble and George Edmonds of Phi
Kappa Sigma emerged victorious in
the Convalescent Home Drive ping
pong tournament Wednesday night.
Miss Diedrich and Mabel Overton,
D.G. entry, entered the finals in
what seemed to be an even match,
but the Roble contestant decisively
conquered her opponent, 6-0, 7-5.
Playing consistently better than
all his opposition, Edmonds met En
cina's Don Strouse in the deciding
game of the contest, and had no
trouble in obtaining a 6-0, 7-5, 6-2
victory.
The winners will be presented
with silver loving cups Labor Day
at the Convalescent Home.
