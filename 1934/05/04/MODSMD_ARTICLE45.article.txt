# BASEBALL NINE NAMES CAPTAINS
## 
### 
Having shared pitching honors be
tween them during the past baseball
season, Stan Anderson and Fred
Heringer were elected co-captains
of the Indian baseball team for 1935.
Anderson, returning to baseball
after a year's absence due to in
juries, was one of the most effective
pitchers in the conference, closing
the season with a brilliant three-hit
victory over St. Mary's. He is also a
football letterman, performing at
fullback on the Cardinal varsity in
1931 and 1932 but was out last season
with a bad knee.
Heringer, one of the mainstays of
the pitching staff, just completed his
second year with the varsity. As a
sophomore he was rated one of the
outstanding pitchers in the C.1.8.A.
and his pitching during the past sea
son kept him in the same category.
Baseball lettermen will meet Sun
day, May 13, at the field house at
Angell Field for their annual bar
becue.
