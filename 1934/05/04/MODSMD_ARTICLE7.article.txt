After an unending amount of controversy, the pro
posed A.S.S.U. Constitution was defeated two weeks ago.
The students voiced their objections, and the Revision
Committee made the changes. Then a Forum was called
to see if there were any more disgruntled students. Only
fifteen appeared, and the meeting never was held.
Apparently, the document Is perfect, tit least to the
point where there is no opposition. If there were any com
plaints, they should have been aired.
The student body owes it to itself to endorse this newly
proposed instrument in order that Stanford's government
may be placed on a workable plane.
