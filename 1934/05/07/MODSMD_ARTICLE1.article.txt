# DOPE UPSET AS TROJANS TRIM INDIANS EASILY
## S.C. Tracksters Better Past Performances To Earn 82 2-3-48 1-3 Victory BLACKMAN WINS 440 New Meet Records Set Up By Lyman, Mottram

Amidst dust, debris, and the din
of crashing walls, Stanford's castles
in the air tumbled to the lloor of the
Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum
Saturday afternoon as the University
of Southern California overwhelmed
the Indian track team, 82 2-3 to
48 1-3.
Stanford, after trouncing Califor
nia by some 15 points more than pre
meet dope had predicted, had been
installed as slight favorites to whip
the Trojans who had barely nosed
out the Bears in a previous meet.
Even the injury to Captain Gus
Meier a week ago had not made
U.S.C. the favorites, at least in
Northern California, as it was be
lieved that the psychological effect
of "win for Captain Gus" would off
set the points which he would have
won.
S.C. Wins Relay
It didn't work out that way, how
ever, and the Trojans took advantage
of every break to virtually clinch
the meet in its early stages and by
the conclusion of the twelfth event,
the broad jump in which SC. scored
a heart-breaking clean sweep, it was
mathematically impossible for the
Indians to win. To add insult to in
jury, the Trojan relay team in the
last event of the day romped away
from Stanford's quartet to breeze in
a winner by 50 yards in 3:14.4.
Stanford pinned its hopes for vic
tory on a duplication of the come
through performances made in the
Big Meet, but they failed to mate
rialize in almost every instance and
even some of those counted as sure
place winners failed to live up to
expectations.
Four Records Kali
Dud Sales was the only man who
picked up unexpected points for the
Indians, taking a second in the jave
lin with a throw of 193 feet 6 1-5
inches after being laid up for several
months with a bad arm.
Four meet records went by the
boards, two going to Stanford men
and two to Trojans. John Lyman
broke his own record in the shot
with another 54-foot throw, the ball
traveling 54 feet % inches. Johnny
Mottram accounted for the other
Stanford record with a toss of 21?
feet 3 inches in the javelin to better
Leo Kibby's 1929 mark by 1 foot
and 4 inches.
Draper Cops Sprints
Foy Draper took the 220-yard dash
in 20.9 seconds to better Charley
Paddock's mark of 21 flat made in
1921, while Everett Winn ground his
way through the two-mile in 9:£1.1
to better Earl Callahan's record.
Things looked rosy for Stanford
after the first event when Nimmo
broke the tape for first in the mile,
tieing the old meet record, but with
the finish of the 100-yard dash things
began to cloud up a bit. It was here
that the Indians were hoping to
break into the Trojan points but tiny
Foy Draper, legs pounding like a
couple of pistons, tore in for the first
of his two victories of the day, fol
lowed by Charley Parsons, while
Jimmy Willson scored Stanford's
only point with a third.
Lyman Wins Two
Things got still darker when Sain
Klopstock hit the first and third bar
riers in the high hurdles and was
barely nosed out by co-Captain Bob
Lyon of U.S.C. in 14.7. Sam came
