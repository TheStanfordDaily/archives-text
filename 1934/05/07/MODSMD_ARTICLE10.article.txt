# 'Farm' Only Name As Lack of Rain Dooms Hay Crop

"Wal, I reckon the old Farm is
a-goin' to wrack and wruin," Fred
W. Frehe, campus foreman of out
side properties, could be
heard to say yesterday. Frehe is
in charge of the hay crop that
surrounds many campus build
ings, and is very much disgusted
with the condition of the crops.
Lack of rain has diminished the
yield of the Stanford acres, ac
cording to Frehe. He did not at
tribute it to a decline in the hay
hay spirit, the "Ilaylo" tradition,
or a failure of Stanford students
to sow their wild oats.
Last spring Stanford authorities
were bothered by the burning of
the stacked hay, and charged dor
mitories for the destroyed stacks.
Stanford gels one-half of the rev
enues from the marketed hay on
a share-cropping basis.
