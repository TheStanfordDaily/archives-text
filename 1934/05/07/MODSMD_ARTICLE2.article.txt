# HALLS TO HOLD CAUCUS TONIGHT
## Halls Meet in Toyon at 9:30; Row Nominations Set For Wednesday Noon at Phi Psi House 
### BOB CALKINS 
Preparing to take advantage of the coursc of political activities of the
Halls which will materialize at their caucus tonight at 9:30 oclock in
Toyon lobby, Greek leaders have announced a meeting of Row factions
Wednesday noon at the Phi Psi house.

The Row usually denies that any
political conference will be held be
fore every election. The announce
ment of the Greek caucus made at
the same time that Hall men made
known the time of their meeting,
changes the course of political cur
rents at Stanford.
Combine Tickets
Casting tradition still further into
the discard, both factions indicate
that they will present combination
tickets, selecting men regardless of
living group affiliations, vote-pulling
power, or athletic popularity. Al
though this statement of good inten
tions has been made many times In
the past, for the first time there
seems to be some hope that this
course will be followed.
All men unaffiliated with Greek
tongs will be welcome at the Hall
caucus tonight where Max Marks of
Sequoia will be in charge, and free
smokes will be provided. Greek
politicians apparently will take it
easy until Wednesday noon to take
advantage of the Hall caucus actions
when a representative from each
group, probably the president, will
name their proteges.
Kahn Favored
Pre-caucus dope has it that Hall
men are irked by the fact that al
though the majority of men on the
campus live in halls, Row candidates
have held the presidency three times
in the last four years. Marvie Kahn
is rumored to be favored Hall choice
this year.
Since the opening of fall quarter
last year Kahn has handled the in
mural managership, is chairman of
the Junior Prom, chairman of Labor
Day, Rally Committee member in
charge of card stunts, and is a for
mer Executive Committee member.
A split in the Greek factions seems
imminent with Johnny Mottram, Phi
Psi; A1 Blackman, Delta Upsilon;
and Gordy Mallatratt, Alpha Delt,
all being promoted by their various
backers. Which one the Row caucus
will name as its candidate is ex
tremely uncertain.
Await Track Selections
A great deal seems to depend on
whether there will be a track captain
named for next season. It is rumored
that should either Mottram or Black
man be named to head the track
sters, the other will then be given
the chance at the president's chair.
Mallatratt plans to run regardless of
what happens to the other two as
piring Row candidates.
All four men are prominent alh
letes, Mottram being the foremost
American university javelin thrower,
Blackman doing outstanding work in
the 220 and 440-yard runs, and Mal
latratt a varsity baseball, basketball,
and former frosh football man.
Mottram is also a member of the
Executive Committee, and was cap
tain of the frosh football team three
years ago. Kahn starred in fresh
man football and is out for basket
ball today. Blackman is a former
president of his class and Mallatratt
is president at the present time.
In case there is no track captain
named for next year it is rumored
that either Mottram or Blackman
will oppose Jimmy Triolo, who has
indicated that he will run for presi
dency of the senior class.

A movie institute is being formed
at U.S.C. to further better moving
pictures.
