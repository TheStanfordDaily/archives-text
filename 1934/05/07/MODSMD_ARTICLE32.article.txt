# New Chappie Razzes Daily
## 
### 
Periodically comes the news thai
a new and different chappie will
burst forth on a startled and highly
pleased campus when the Old Boy
gets around to it on an average of
once a month. This time it will
burst in the form of a supposedly
screamingly funny dig at campus
publications, the attempt being the
"Illustrated Daily News" number.
Going on the assumption thai
j Stanford boys and gals will agree
with the Chappie that campus pub
lications, aside from the esteemed
and venerable monthly, are the in
; stitutions on the Farm which are
most worthy of the razzberry, Old
Boy Algar expccts a big boom in
sales for this number.
"And don't forget,"' he says, "Fri
day is the day to dish out that dime,
that nickel, and that penny."
