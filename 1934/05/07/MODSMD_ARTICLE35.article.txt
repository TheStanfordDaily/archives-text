# Caution Needed in Making By-Laws
## 
### 
I»v almost the same percentage by wliicii they defeated
the lirsl proposed now constitution, Stanford students in
Friday's election voted their endorsement of the new gov
ernmental setup which will guide the campus for the next
several years.
The Daily urges interested Stanfordites to he watchful
in the passage of various by-law's. The Executive Commit
tee has the complete right to install by a four-fifths vote
the by-laws the most important phases of the entire con
stitution.
Several things need watching. For one, too much power
should NOT he vested in the group of "student leaders"
who essay to control the A.S.S.t . Willi one or two excep
tions, there is nobody on the Executive Committee who is
qualified to pass on some of the intricate problems which
have confronted that body in the past —and which un
doubtedly will confront it in the future.
Already the Constitutional Revision Committee has
swung into action and taken steps to draw lip social regu
lations and methods of election for adoption at tonight's
Ex Committee meeting. Nobody was terribly anxious
about getting any advance publicity on these meetings,
{'lid while there is no indication that there will be anv
railroading attempted, it would be wise both for the re
's ision group and campus organizations which will be af
fected to get together before the all-powerful Executive
Committee casts its all-powerful vote.
The Daily cautions the revisioncrs to be careful not to
step on the toes of interested groups—dramatics, athletics,
publications, and perhaps a few others. Furthermore, it
cautions the Executive Committee.
