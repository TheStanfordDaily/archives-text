# THERE IS STILL A WEAKNESS
## 
### 
Because it was urgent that an improved method of
government l>e installed, the Daily did not like to oppose
on one point the constitution -which was passed Friday.
We preferred to lake the sportsman's chance and hope
;hat the students would realize that a centralized control
of the campus is likely to prove more harmful than bene
ficial.
The affixing of 150 signatures to a petition will demand
r change of that evil. The Ex Committee is not a group
qualified to cope with problems in specialized fields. In
the Daily's own case, Executive Committee bunglings in
the last two elections have threatened to undermine the
entire organization of the paper. We do not propose to
have it happen again.
Bv placing the control of the Daily within the Daily
(and of the dramatics group within the dramatics group,
etc.) more efficient control can result. By-laws can be
drawn up in such a manner that the Executive Committee
will not have to bother about situations beyond its ability
to handle properly.
In the interests of Stanford and its institutions, we hope
il will be done.
