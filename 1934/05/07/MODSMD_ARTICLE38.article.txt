## Propaganda — Red and Brown 
### CROMPTON BANGS Jr 
The Red boogey-man no longer !
arouses America like it used to. Af
-ler fifteen years of work, there are !
not more than fifty thousand Com- ;
rnunists in the country. There were
more than that ten years ago. But
some newspapers and some people '
are still worried. They are afraid
of the Brain Trust's alleged Red ;
leanings. The Los Angeles. Times
stands for these people.
About two weeks ago, was pub- j
lished a lengthy and pointless edi
torial entitled "The Trek to Mos- j
cow." The substance of its 1800
words could have been expressed in i
two sentences: (1) The brain Trust j
had led U.S. on the road to Moscow:
(2) the American people should
overthrow the Brain Trust.
Germany's Dr. Vollbclir
Two days before this editorial j
appeared in the paper, your column
ist received a photostat copy of it
by mail, with undbrscorings by a
Dr. Otto Vollbehr, who also paid the
postage. This is not unusual. Bui
five days later an article about Dr.
Vollbehr appeared in the Los An- |
geles Times. A copy of it likewise
arrived before its date lino.
Vollbehr is a book collcctor, a
German citizen, and a Nazi sym
pathizer. He has sold about iivt
million dollars worth of valuable
books since the war.
The Times' article was an inter
view in which he warned the U.S.
of the Red menace and Moscow's
agents. He praised Hitler, said the
German people were happy and ad- 1

vised the U.S. to copy Hitler and
stamp out Communism. He drew a
parallel between German Commu
nist intellectuals and America's
Brain Trust, advocating prison terms
for both.
What About It?
Dr. Vollbehr has applied for citi
zenship. Many correspondents and
some U.S. officials say he is a Nazi
agitator, and a heavy contributor to
the Hitler campaign fund.
If this is ihe case, the Los Angeles
Times has fallen into a neat trap. It
stand* on a platform of American
ism. The Brown propaganda of Hit
lerism is just as contrary to these
principles as is ihe Red propaganda
of Communism. Life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness would prevail
under neither Red nor Brown.
Counter Propaganda
Only propaganda can fight propa
ganda. To fight, what it thinks is a
Red menace to American institu
tions, the L.A. Times has trotted out
an anti-Red campaign. That the ma
terial used is Nazi propaganda is
probably a coincidence. But the peo
ple of Los Angeles and vicinity
would be just as unhappy under
Hitlerism as under Communism. It
so happens that the shadow of Mas
cow obscures the shadow of Hitler
—at least to them.
The best thing to do is to let both
Reds and Browns talk all they want.
As long as they can, they will have
no gripe and therefore nothing to
talk about. Shutting up one or 'he
other is what makes trouble.
