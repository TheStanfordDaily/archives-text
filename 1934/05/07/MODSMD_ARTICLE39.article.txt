## ABOUT THIS BEER PROBLEM 
### BOB LETTS 
One week ago today, The Daily
I came forth with an editorial (really
j three editorials in one) which ad
j vanced the cause of placing beer in
1 the Union Cellar. There were two
reasons:
I 1. —Allowing Stanford students
I that freedom would take away the
j "thrill" of visiting some of the near
by suds gardens and would prob-
I ably result in a little more stanity, as
| regards their drinking.
2. —Keeping the students on the
campus would lower the Stanford
"fatality list." Accidents in general
have shown a 40 per cent increase
since December, according to re
ports, and much of the rise has been
due to drunken drivers on the high
ways.
