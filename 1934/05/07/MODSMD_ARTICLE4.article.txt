# Roth Speaks In Broadcast
## Lecturer To Air Student Finance Problems 
### 
I Financial problems t>f present
| day students will be discussed by
! Almon E. Roth, comptroller of the
| University, when he speaks over
I radio station KPO tonight at 7:45
j o'clock.
Roth, as Stanford's comptroller, is
! familiar with the opportunities for
student employment, and during the
j Stanford University Hour will tell
i the radio audience what chance the
I modern student has to earn pai't or
; all of his way through privately en
; dowed colleges and universities.
Much has been done to encourage
j students of limited means to enroll
I in private universities, according to
Roth, and it has been commonly
! assumed that any student with
! sound health and a willingness to
work can earn his way through any
college in the country. He will ex
plain in his talk whether this as
j sumption is wholly or only partly
| true, with special inference to the
! situation created by the present de
j pression in the matter of student
! employment.
In concluding his talk Roth will
answer some of the questions most
frequently asked of university ad
ministrators, namely: How much a
; year does it cost the average stu
dent to attend college, what are the
universities now doing to assist
needy students, and what more can
the universities do to aid these
i needy students?
