# SOCIOLOGY OF DRINKING
## 
### 
The one point overlooked in this
matter was the fact that allowing
beer on the campus would not nec
essarily bring with it a knowledge
of drinking, something in which our
generation seems to de decidedly
lacking.
After having published the mate
rial, I went in to see Dr. Wilbur,
who had returned the day before
from the East. Following the dis
cussion of several other matters, I
asked him if he had read the beer
editorial. He replied:
"Yes, and it had the ears of a
jackass sticking out all over it."
My ears aren't QUITE that big,
but the overlooking of that one point
about the student drinkers (particu
larly the frosh and sophs) being
numskulls when it comes to indul
gence was enough, I now admit, to
cause that feeling.
