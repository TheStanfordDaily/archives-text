Funny thing about the aforemen
tioned conversation. I told a couple
of friends about Dr. Wilbur's atti

days later, the story came back that
he had ordered me to come into his

my existence in the University.
The truth of the matter is (in case
you've been interested enough to be
misinformed) that he did NOT issue
any orders or threats. My, how
things are magnified!
