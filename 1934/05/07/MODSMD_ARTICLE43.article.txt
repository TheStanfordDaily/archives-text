# SLINKING TACTICS REACT BADLY

'"V. R." Breitner appeared in The
Daily office the other day to com
plain about a Campus Opinion which
had appeared last week bearing his
name. He did not write it, and there
was no authorization for its publica
tionâ€”either within or without the
office. Somebody slipped it by the
night desk, evidently.
Having had one previous experi
ence of the same nature, I've made
it a point to check on all letters.
May apologies to Brietner (whose
initials, incidentally, are L. vR. and
not V. R.) be a warning to people
who haven't the courage of their
convictions and who must sign other
names, or no names at all.
