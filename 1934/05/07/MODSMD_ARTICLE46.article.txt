THE TRAGICAL HISTORY OF
DOCTOR FAUSTUS (Marlowe)
At the Palo Alto Community Theatre
Rarely does an amateur group at
tempt a production on the noble
proportions of this Christopher Mar
lowe tragedy, and more rarely still
is there achieved such a well
rounded success as that of last Fri
day night.
Using an intelligently cut version,
the Palo Alto players presented a
performance which was not only ex
tremely satisfying, but which car
ried the audience to genuine dra
matic heights in its final moments.
The visual effects were uniquely
good. The settings, simple in the
extreme, served materially to en
hance the intensity of the drama;
this is notably true of the setting i'oi
Faustus' study. This effectiveness
might have been considerably les
sened, however, had it not been for
the excellent lighting effects.
James Sandoe's direction caught
brilliantly the deep significance oi
the Marlowe play, and successfully
realized all its dramatic possibilities,
in addition to the creation of several
fine comedy portions. The piece built
nicely, and as an organic whole, lo
ward the climactic moment when
Faustus loses his soul.
Sandoe's performance in the lead

. ing role showed 'he same sincerity
! and understanding. He built his
characterization with considerable
skill and consistency, and deserves
special credit,for conveying, in the
• latter scenes, the impression ox
Faustus' gradual decline. And just'
as the figure of the Doctor outshines
all the other characters of the play,
i so did Sandoe surpass in excellence
the other played.
I Particular credit is due George
Leavens for his splendid handling of
i the lines of the chorus. Never an
, easy task, that of reading the fine
| Marlowe lines was handled admir
| ably by Leavens.
Robert Dwan's was an uneven
Mephistophilus, but in the main
i Dwan gave a sincere and convincing
| performance; his voice was excel
lently suited to the role. As Lucifer,
; George Wilson appeared briefly, but
I to advantage.
Dick Dawson proved himself an
i exceedingly clever comediAn in the
part of Wagner, and garnered a good
many well-deserved laughs. His
partner in comedy, Paul Crary, was
| likewise splendid.
Of the others, James Broughton
I for his work as the Pope, Jack Whit
: ling for his Gluttony, and Mary Liles
! for her Evil Angel, deserve com
| mendation. —Chapin
