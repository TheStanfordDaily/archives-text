# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
Since arguments make no impres
sion on the kind of minds that hiss
professors. I suggest that a substitute
voice of protest be adopted. Why not
boo instead of hiss? These harsh,
grating "ss" sounds give me the
creeps. But boos are not unpleasant.
When properly presented they even
sound well. Make it a song. "800-la,
boo-la."
Of course that sounds sort of
movie-collegiate but I will put with
hotcha-hotcha boys with Christian
fortitude and resignation if I don't
have to listen to snakes in the grass.
Sincerely,
Elmer Dethlefs.
