j Among the most interesting of the
| Museum collections is that included
1 in the two oriental rooms in which
| Chinese, Japanese, and Korean arti
-1 cles are displayed. The Chinese and
j Japanese exhibits were mainly col
lected by Mrs. Leland Stanford,
j Most of these were from the fa
: mous Ikcda collection which Mrs.
I Stanford intercepted when it was
I about to be shipped to England for
| sale. It contains pieces which are
I Ihe best of their kind, all being orig
j inals and ranging from a few hun
| dred to several thousand years old.
The rare Korean collection wa\
j given to the Museum by Timothy
| Hopkins, senior member of the Board
i of Trustees.
! The oriental rooms contain a large
j variety of types and classifications,
ranging from old porcelains, potter
ies, and bronzes to rare crystals,
jades, bone and ivory carvings to
beautiful paintings, wood carvings,
and embroidery work.
A unique example of porcelain
ware is an old peach blow-vase

valued at ,$12,500. This piece repre
sents a lost art. The peculiar coloring
and etching scroll work traced on
white glaze and filled ift with color
have never been reproduced.
Cloisonne vases cast in metal with
surfaces ornamented with a process
of colored enamel, then fired which
are found in one of the cases rep
resenting the peak of a gradual evo
lution of art which began with the
simple etching in metal vases and
insense burners.
The Japanese paintings on fine silk
represent a distinctive achievement
in which the artist had to know his
subject perfectly before beginning
his work.
Among other things the Korean
collection includes a Japanese Koro
or high bronze vase about 10 feet,
made in 1650; a jinrikisha, a hand
carved piece presented to Senator
Iceland Stanford by the emperor of
China, armor, drapes, many cos
tume types, ancient musical instru
ments of the Orient, â– find models
representing a sedan chair, a Chi
nese house, and a theatre wagon.
A large Japanese cabinet made of
prehistoric wood and finely deco
rated with ivory, pearl, and stone is
one of the most popular exhibits.
