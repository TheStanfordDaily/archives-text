# BULL SESSION
## YOUR DOLLAR AND MINE 
### 
Each quarter the Stanford Union j
reaches its itching fingers into hun
dreds of $114 checks and makes off ,
with hundreds of crisp greenbacks, j
Stanford men, who once had the run |
of the Union, could once see a rea- |
son for their dear dollars being !
trundled off to the Union treasury.
But though they no longer have the j
run of the Union, Stanford men are j
still submitted to the tri-yearly
milking.
Some, trying to lend voice to their ,
griped condition, have shouted: "No
taxation without representation."
Unfortunately, the men do have rep- J
resentation. There are student mem- !
bers on the Union Board of Gover- j
nors. That is doubly unfortunate;
for the representatives have not been
able to secure any justice for Stan
ford men, and Stanford men are de- '
nied the use of a good patriotic
slogan.
So Stanford men have dropped j
history, faced reality, and screamed: |
"No taxation." The tax, insofar as j
the rough is concerned, is based j
neither on benefit derived nor on
ability to pay. The rough's "ability
to-pay" for anything other than ,
dates has been seriously cut with |
the arrival of the "800." The only I
1 people who derive benefit from the |
New Union are the women who in
habit it, and the professors who eat I
in the Union dining room.
If the one dollar subsidy is essen
tial to the continued existence of the !
Union unit, it seems only fair that j
the dollars should come from any- >
body but the rough. The women, !
who derive most of the benefit there i
is to derive, are one source of addi
tional revenue. Another possibility j
is the professorate. That perpetual j
white elephant, the dining room, j
which eats the profits of the whole I
Union enterprise into the red, is ]
kept open primarily for the con- I
venience of the faculty and their j
friends. Strangely enough, profes- j
sors like quiet; few students do. If I
there are Union fees to assess, the \
professorate should pay for its quiet.
If it is only a matter of book
keeping, if the Union dollar ex
tracted from the men would have to j
be extracted whether or not it was
vised for the Union, then the Admin
istration should rename the "Union j
Dollar." We love to be kidded.
