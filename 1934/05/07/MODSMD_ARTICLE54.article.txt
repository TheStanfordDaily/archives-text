# HOOVER, ENGINEER HEAD, GIVES PICNIC
## 
### 
Yesterday's chief topic of discus
sion for Stanford engineers was
Saturday's picnic, sponsored by
Theodore J. Hoover, dean of the
School of Engineering, and his wife,
proving that the affair left indelible
memories in the minds of local
technicians. The picnic, an annual
affair, was held at I:he Waddell
Creek ranch of Professor and Mrs.
Hoover for the benefit of all engi
neering and geology students.
Honors of the day, including the
perpetual trophy, a huge iron bowl,
were carried off by members of the
independent group, who won the
track meet which featured the af
ternoon's festivities.
Second place was taken by the
civil engineers, who were actually
tied with the independents at the
conclusion of the regularly sched
uled events, but who found them
selves on the losing end of the
score when returns from the shot
put, introduced to break the tie,
were announced.
Approximately 225 students and
faculty members attended the picnic
and feasted on mutton, beans, po
tato salad, and cider — especially
cider — supplied by Professor and
Mrs. Hoover. The committee in
charge of arrangements consisted of
Eliot Stoner, chairman, Wesley
Dunlap, Richard Hattrup, Henry
Neel. Henry Blanchard, Leslie Motz,
Brooks Morris, Lvle Smith, and
Francis Rogallo.
