SELF IN SOUTH
Los Angeles wiseacres and track
experts claimed Johnny McCarthy,
the U.S.C. speedster, second only to
Jimmy LuValle as the outstanding
quarter-miler on the Coast, but one
of the few bright lights of Satur
day's meet for Stanford fans was Al
Blackman's performance in whip
ping the Trojan in his own back
yard.
McCarthy took aiY early lead and
held it around the last turn but
Blackman, who has improved his
finish over last year to a great ex
tent, came up fast and nipped the
Southern California at the tape in
47.8. The time would undoubtedly
have been faster had the race not
been run around two turns.
As a high school runner, Mc-
Carthy was just about the best quar
ter-miler ever turned out in South
ern California. He held three deci
sions over Jim LuValle, recognized
now as the outstanding 440 man in
the country, and shade 48 seconds
in x jre P meets. Just after graduat
ing from high school two years ago,
he underwent an appendicitis op
eration from which it took him soma
time to recover and this is the first
season since that he has regained his
old form.
LYMAN, MOTTRAM
CONTINUE TO SHINE
John Lyman for the second time
in two weeks pushed the shot over
54 feet. Two weeks ago that would
have bettered the old world record
by close to two feet, but since Jack
Torrance's great throw of 55 feet lVz
inches it doesn't even come close.
The two will meet in the NC2A's in
Los Angeles this June and many are
predicting a victory for the Stanford
weightman despite the Louisiana
giant's better record.
Johnny Mottram, although net
equaling his early season mark of
220 feet, was the other Stanford man
to crack a meet record Saturday with
a throw of 212 feet 3 inches. Motl
ram's consistency at better can 210
feet places him as one of the two best
spear throwers in the country, Duane
Purvis of Purdue, last year's inter
collegiate champion, being the other.
Thev will also meet in the NC2A's.
SOUTHERN CALIF.
4 SLINGER'S" JINX
Southern California is evidently
"Slinger" Dunn's jinx spot. So far
this year he has competed there
twice, in the Long Beach relays and
against U.S.C., and both times he has
failed to qualify. Yet, with marks
around 160 feet, he is rated as one of
the best in the country.
Next Saturday's Fresno relays
should bring some sterling perform
ances. The mile relay duel between
U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. should be one
of the best. The Trojans ran 3:14.4
against Stanford Saturday while a
week ago the Bruin quartet broke a
long standing Drake relays record
in the event. U.S.C. rates as a fa
vorite by virtue of better records by
individual members of the team.

quarter-miler on the Coast, but one
of the few bright lights of Satur
day's meet for Stanford fans was Al
Blackman's performance in whip
ping the Trojan in his own back
yard.
McCarthy took aiY early lead and
held it around the last turn but
Blackman, who has improved his
finish over last year to a great ex
tent, came up fast and nipped the
Southern California at the tape in
47.8. The time would undoubtedly
have been faster had the race not
been run around two turns.
As a high school runner, Mc-
Carthy was just about the best quar
ter-miler ever turned out in South
ern California. He held three deci
sions over Jim LuValle, recognized
now as the outstanding 440 man in
the country, and shade 48 seconds
in x jre P meets. Just after graduat
ing from high school two years ago,
he underwent an appendicitis op
eration from which it took him soma
time to recover and this is the first
season since that he has regained his
old form.
LYMAN, MOTTRAM
CONTINUE TO SHINE
John Lyman for the second time
in two weeks pushed the shot over
54 feet. Two weeks ago that would
have bettered the old world record
by close to two feet, but since Jack
Torrance's great throw of 55 feet lVz
inches it doesn't even come close.
The two will meet in the NC2A's in
Los Angeles this June and many are
predicting a victory for the Stanford
weightman despite the Louisiana
giant's better record.
Johnny Mottram, although net
equaling his early season mark of
220 feet, was the other Stanford man
to crack a meet record Saturday with
a throw of 212 feet 3 inches. Motl
ram's consistency at better can 210
feet places him as one of the two best
spear throwers in the country, Duane
Purvis of Purdue, last year's inter
collegiate champion, being the other.
Thev will also meet in the NC2A's.
SOUTHERN CALIF.
4 SLINGER'S" JINX
Southern California is evidently
"Slinger" Dunn's jinx spot. So far
this year he has competed there
twice, in the Long Beach relays and
against U.S.C., and both times he has
failed to qualify. Yet, with marks
around 160 feet, he is rated as one of
the best in the country.
Next Saturday's Fresno relays
should bring some sterling perform
ances. The mile relay duel between
U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. should be one
of the best. The Trojans ran 3:14.4
against Stanford Saturday while a
week ago the Bruin quartet broke a
long standing Drake relays record
in the event. U.S.C. rates as a fa
vorite by virtue of better records by
individual members of the team.
