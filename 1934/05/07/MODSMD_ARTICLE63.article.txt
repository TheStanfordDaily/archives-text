# Card Polo Four Licks San Mateans, 9-3
## DECIDING GAME OF SERIES TAKEN BY STANFORD RIDERS 
### 
Proving their right to be called
the best poloists on the Coast, Stan
ford riders defeated Will Tevis' San
Mateo team Saturday afternoon by
a score of 9 to 3.
The game proved to be one of the
fastest seen on the campus in some
time, and for the first time during
the three games played between the
two teams the Redshirts held a de
cided upper hand. Both the first
two games of the series, played early
in April, were more even, the first
won by Stanford 10 to 8 and the
second dropped 6 to 7.
Cards Given Handicap
Lupe Luppcn, Bill Rogers, and
Rus Rasmussen divided the Stan
ford tallies between them, each
scoring two goals, while the addi
tional three were given by handicap.
Bob Fullerton completed the four,
the first string, which rode for the
first time in a campus game this
quarter.
Will Tevis was the most formid
able opponent the four have had to
face, having scored two of his team's
three goals. His teammates, Bradley,
Gilmore, and Fuller, all rank with
him as first rate poloists. All are
prominent sportsmen of the Penin
sula, and brought their own mounts
with them for Saturday's game.
Score 3 in Fourth
The first three chukkers Saturday
were slow, with the Redshirts scor
ing only once. In the fourth period,
however, with their best mounts, the
Cards scored three goals in rapid
succession. A lone tally in the final
period marked a last effort on the
part of the San Mateo riders to cut
down the Indians' lead.
The Stanford four face another
busy week-end when they travel
south four days from now to face the
University of Arizona poloists in Los
Angeles.

Co-eds at New York University
who would be popular are urged not
to get sentimental by the fraternity
men, who want the campus girls to
understand that when they ask for
dates they're seeking playmates, not
matrimonial partners.
