# L.A.A.C. TO SEND ACE POLO SQUAD FOR TANK SERIES
## 
### 
As well as a struggle for Pacific
Coast supremacy, the Stanford-Los
Angeles Athletic Club water poio
series, to be played Friday and Sat
urday in Encina pools, will feature a
battle between two groups of in
dividual stars.
The games, a part of the annual
Convalescent Home Drive, are
scheduled for Friday afternoon at 2
o'clock, Saturday afternoon at 2
o'clock, and Saturday evening at 8
o'clock. Admission has been set at
25 cents, and ladies are invited.
Three All-Americans
The L.A.A.C. aggregation claims
the greatest collection of water polo
stars ever assembled on one Ameri
can team. They are all veterans of
international competition.
The Mercuries have three all-
Americans—Phil Daubenspeck, for
ward; Dutch McAllister, guard; and
Charles Finn, guard.
Sensational both offensively and
defensively, Daubenspeck has been
rated one of the greatest forwards of
all time. Teaming with him is Wally
O'Connor at the other forward posi
tion. O'Connor was a member of the
U.S. Olympic team in 1924, 1928, and
1932.
Past Card Swimmers
O'Connor, McAllister, and Cal
Strong are all former Stanford stars.
In 1925, O'Connor was national in
tercollegiate 220 and 440-yard swim
ming champion. Strong captained the 1
1928 Stanford national intercollegiate
water polo champions.
Another powerful aquatic star on
the Los Angeles roster is Herby
Wildman, one of the country's out
standing goalies.
But Stanford will at least partially
match these southerners in the in
dividual star department.
Possibly the most interesting duel
of the series will found when Captain
Gordy Graves, one of the outstand
ing guards now in competition,
tackles the assignment of taming

Daubenspeck.
With a powerful throwing arm
and plenty of swimming speed, Vlad
Taranik will furnish a distinct Car
dinal scoring threat. Taranik has
been leading scorer of the Northern
California Water Polo League for
two straight years.
Triolo Doubtful
Considered the best Northern Cal
ifornia goalie, Leo Cook has proved

i
consistent and cool in warding off j
opposing scoring thrusts.
Jimmy Trioio, once a real star for I
Stanford, probably will see little ac- ;
tion during the series, having re- j
cently recovered from an appcndi- |
citus attack. Other cogs in the Stan- I
ford machine, which will feature the j
Hungarian type of play, are Bob Fos
ter, Paul de Silva, Jim Benet, Bill '
Woodard, and Wallv Wiget.

Strong are all former Stanford stars.
In 1925, O'Connor was national in
tercollegiate 220 and 440-yard swim
ming champion. Strong captained the 1
1928 Stanford national intercollegiate
water polo champions.
Another powerful aquatic star on
the Los Angeles roster is Herby
Wildman, one of the country's out
standing goalies.
But Stanford will at least partially
match these southerners in the in
dividual star department.
Possibly the most interesting duel
of the series will found when Captain
Gordy Graves, one of the outstand
ing guards now in competition,
tackles the assignment of taming

Daubenspeck.
With a powerful throwing arm
and plenty of swimming speed, Vlad
Taranik will furnish a distinct Car
dinal scoring threat. Taranik has
been leading scorer of the Northern
California Water Polo League for
two straight years.
Triolo Doubtful
Considered the best Northern Cal
ifornia goalie, Leo Cook has proved

i
consistent and cool in warding off j
opposing scoring thrusts.
Jimmy Trioio, once a real star for I
Stanford, probably will see little ac- ;
tion during the series, having re- j
cently recovered from an appcndi- |
citus attack. Other cogs in the Stan- I
ford machine, which will feature the j
Hungarian type of play, are Bob Fos
ter, Paul de Silva, Jim Benet, Bill '
Woodard, and Wallv Wiget.
As well as a struggle for Pacific
Coast supremacy, the Stanford-Los
Angeles Athletic Club water poio
series, to be played Friday and Sat
urday in Encina pools, will feature a
battle between two groups of in
dividual stars.
The games, a part of the annual
Convalescent Home Drive, are
scheduled for Friday afternoon at 2
o'clock, Saturday afternoon at 2
o'clock, and Saturday evening at 8
o'clock. Admission has been set at
25 cents, and ladies are invited.
Three All-Americans
The L.A.A.C. aggregation claims
the greatest collection of water polo
stars ever assembled on one Ameri
can team. They are all veterans of
international competition.
The Mercuries have three all-
Americans—Phil Daubenspeck, for
ward; Dutch McAllister, guard; and
Charles Finn, guard.
Sensational both offensively and
defensively, Daubenspeck has been
rated one of the greatest forwards of
all time. Teaming with him is Wally
O'Connor at the other forward posi
tion. O'Connor was a member of the
U.S. Olympic team in 1924, 1928, and
1932.
