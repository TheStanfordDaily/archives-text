# GREEKS ABOLISH "HELL WEEK" IN COUNCIL'S VOTE
## Abolition of Time-Worn Tradition Believed a Great Step by Members of Fraternity Board; Pledges Breathe Much Easier 
### WARREN BREED 
"Hell Week," long the bane of freshman fraternity pledge classes, Uie
fraternities themselves, and one and all connected with the University, i.s
110 more. The Interfraternity Board, at a meeting last night, adopted this
revolutionary action after it had been recommended by the Interfraternity
Council.

The abolition of this tradition, as'
old as the fraternities themselves, is
a great step forward. Initiation of
new members will now be of a con
structive nature, in contrast to the
heretofore childish, high-school type
of prattling horseplay, according to
Donn Tutum, Board chairman.
Row's Move
Abolition was brought about en
tirely by the fraternities themselves.
Row leaders for the past year have
realized that the prevailing mode of
shallow "Hell-Week" initiation was
deterimental to their men on the
campus. They also realized that a
new type of constructive initiation
to their number would bind the ini
tiates closer together, imbue them
with the true fraternal spirit, and
eliminate all unnecessary triviality
from Greek ritual.
Last night's action effects a change
long awaited by associates of the
University. Repeatedly excessive
displays by playful initiators have
gotten the University into trouble,
and faculty, neighbors, and local
residents have voiced disapproval of
the nuisance resulting.
Provisions Made
Full provisions of the document,
recommended by the Council and I
adopted by the Board, follow:
1. That the term "Hell Week" be j
abolished, and the term "Pre-Initia- ;
tion Period" be substituted for it
wherever necessary.
2. The activities of the Pre-Initia
tion Period shall not interfere with
scholarship or with property, or
peace and quiet of any other person
or group of persons.
Illegal Activities
3. Any activity undertaken as a ,
part of the Pre-Initiation Period and !
not within the confines of the initiat
ing fraternity shall be undertaken 3t
the discretion of the initiating house. J
Any violation of any of these rules 1
shall be sufficient cause for action
on the part of the Interfraternity
Board of Control.
4. In accordance with University 1
regulations, no task shall be im- '
posed on or request be made of any j
initiate that would make him appear i
ridiculous in the eyes of the public. |
5. Each fraternity shall report in ;
advance to the Interfraternity Board j
of Control the dates of its Pre-Initia - '
tion Period.

"Hell Week," long the bane of freshman fraternity pledge classes, Uie
fraternities themselves, and one and all connected with the University, i.s
110 more. The Interfraternity Board, at a meeting last night, adopted this
revolutionary action after it had been recommended by the Interfraternity
Council.

The abolition of this tradition, as'
old as the fraternities themselves, is
a great step forward. Initiation of
new members will now be of a con
structive nature, in contrast to the
heretofore childish, high-school type
of prattling horseplay, according to
Donn Tutum, Board chairman.
Row's Move
Abolition was brought about en
tirely by the fraternities themselves.
Row leaders for the past year have
realized that the prevailing mode of
shallow "Hell-Week" initiation was
deterimental to their men on the
campus. They also realized that a
new type of constructive initiation
to their number would bind the ini
tiates closer together, imbue them
with the true fraternal spirit, and
eliminate all unnecessary triviality
from Greek ritual.
Last night's action effects a change
long awaited by associates of the
University. Repeatedly excessive
displays by playful initiators have
gotten the University into trouble,
and faculty, neighbors, and local
residents have voiced disapproval of
the nuisance resulting.
Provisions Made
Full provisions of the document,
recommended by the Council and I
adopted by the Board, follow:
1. That the term "Hell Week" be j
abolished, and the term "Pre-Initia- ;
tion Period" be substituted for it
wherever necessary.
2. The activities of the Pre-Initia
tion Period shall not interfere with
scholarship or with property, or
peace and quiet of any other person
or group of persons.
Illegal Activities
3. Any activity undertaken as a ,
part of the Pre-Initiation Period and !
not within the confines of the initiat
ing fraternity shall be undertaken 3t
the discretion of the initiating house. J
