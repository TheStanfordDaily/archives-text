# Latest Campus Play Is Ready To Be Staged
## Many Good Seats Are Left As Three Days Remain For Ducat Sale More Students Interested, Says Manager Kahn 
### 
For the first time in recent years,
all three acts of "Three Cornored
Moon" have been rounded into
shape, with three days remaining
before the performance Friday eve
ning. Ben Cave, dramatic manager,
reports that the cast is virtually
letter-perfect, and that sets, props,
and costumes are nearing comple
tion.
There are, he stresses, good seats
left. Even in case of a sell-out,
tickets for the better positions will
be available until the final day of
sale.'
Sale until Friday
Seat sale will continue until Fri
day at A.S.S.U. offices in the Old
Union, from 9 to 5 o'clock. Prices
are 50 and 75 cents and $1, the 50-
cent seats being side balcony, the
75-cent ducats, including center
balcony and rear main floor seats,
and the $1 section comprising the
main floor front.
One of the most novel publicity
stunts to date is the posting of cari
catures on the English corner; three
went up yesterday. Jean Albertson,
Kay Arthur, and James Benet were
sketched by Gilman Gist as the first
installment of the cast portrait, with
two more to be added today.
A Comedy
The comedy, written by Gertrude
Tonkonogy, concerns the hectic
household of the Rimplegars. Mrs.
Rimplegar is a middle-aged eccen
tric, forty but foolish, upon whom
devolves the responsibility of dispos
ing of an inheritance. Shelley Smith
portrays her daughter, Elizabeth, a
staid influence in an otherwise in
sane family.
James Benet fills the role of the
eldest Rimplegar son, who spends
the greater part of his life at the
telephone.
Kay Arthur as Maid
Kay Arthur, from her leading role ;
in "Distant Drums," changes charac
ter to that of a stupid but well
meaning Czechoslovakian maid. J
complete with accent.
Harriet Hall appears as a vivacious |
flapper, and Robert Balzar as a tem- j
peramental artist; Pete' Peck, Noai
Berry, and Joe Chamberlain, well
known to campus audiences, com
plete the cast roster.
Ruth Nutting, Gordon Langsdorf k
Henry Laws, Arch Sampson, and
Mill Luhman aided Chairman Mer
rill Collett in getting the names of
the workers.
Collett announces that food will
be served at 5 o'clock and not before,
and then only when everyone is suf
ficiently quiet so as to avoid theJ
expensive repitition of broken tables
of two years ago.
