# Convalescent Home Kids No Different from Others
## 
### B KELLOGG 
Kids at the Convalescent Home are no different from other kids—except
that they're "getting well," Miss Ruth Spande, superintendent of the Home,
said yesterday. They are all as mentally alert as any youngsters of early

school and cause their nurses
just as much trouble with their
pranks.
And when it comes to school
ing— just being in the Home
doesn't excuse anyone. They all
have to attend classes and learn
their lessons. But they have
their vacations, too, and now
from the youngest to the oldest
pupil they're waiting for June
15.
"Bed patients" only have half
a day of lessons and receive
their instruction from individ
ual tutors and learn the same
lessons that those in the "run
around" group do. The kids able
to run around take their "learn
in' " in the classroom.
Summer vacation days arc
anything but idle ones at the
Home, where 70 between the
ages of (5 and 12 "run wild." The
boys spend their time between
the glassed-in playhouse and
the manual training department
where they make a variety ;>f
toys. The girls weave handbags,
make napkins, and do other
needlework.
Good times at the home come
out of the "Fun Fund." The
Fourth of July celebrations, the
birthdays and other affairs come
out of this fund, founded in 192(5

by Mrs. M. Eaton (former Laura Mitchell, daughter of Registrar J. P.
Mitchell).
Classes in handicraft and weaving were started soveral years ago by i
group of volunteer workers. All of the interested children take pail in
this work.
