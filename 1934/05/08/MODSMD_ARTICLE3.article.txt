## Novel Programs Designed; Bids Sold Today At A.S.S.U. Offices 
### 
Junior Prom dancers this year
will enjoy the strains of Ernie Heck
scher's 15-piece orchestra, accord
ing to Chairman Marvie Kahn.
Heckscher's band made its campus
debut at the Masque Bull, and was
featured at the Toyon Garden party
last week.
A variety of entertainment will be
included in its program for the Prom
on May 38, with a guitar solo by
Ernie Heckscher and a vocal trio
composed of newly-discovered talent
in the persons of Philura Graham,
Margot Leland, and Frances Terrell.
Motif Is Elaborate
As a new feature of campus
dances, music will be furnished from
overhead. The orchestra will be
placed on an especially constructed
stand in the balcony of the dance
studio.
The contract for the decorations
for the dance has been completed but
the details will not be out until to
morrow. However, there will be
something entirely new with an
elaborate motif.
Address System
The newly purchased A.S.S.U. ad
dress system may be christened at
the Prom. Being the finest avail
able, this address system will add lo
future campus dances.
The programs will come in some
time this week. They are made of
black patent leather picturing a
couple looking over a balcony on the
front cover. Inside are pounded
silver linings and special imported
French paper. Bids will be avail
able in the A.S.S.U. office tomorrow
for $3.00.
