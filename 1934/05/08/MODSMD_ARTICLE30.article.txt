### CROMPTON BANGS Jr 
Yesterday a prisoner was whisked
from a steamer in New York, hur
ried to a Chicago-bound train by
Federal agents. Their prisoner was
Samuel Insull, wanted for quite a
few things by 500,000 investors who
lost their shirts. The U.S. wants him
for committing fraud through the
mails. Now what did Insull do and
what sort of a criminal, if any, is he?
In his heyday, Insull was president
of 11 corporations, mostly big and
rich public utilities. He was a direc
tor in 85 more—almost a record.
This is where the trouble started.
Insull had too much to look after,
tried to make too much money from
too many corporations.
A Few Highlights
In an attempt to build up a nation
wide utility empire, Insull bought up
many companies, combined them,
.sold stocks on the merged corpora
tions for more than they were worth.
In order to be able to sell these
stocks, Insull through Halsey, Stuart
& Co., hired a Chicago professor to
speak over the radio as "The Old
Counsellor." His job was to advise
people impartially on the merits and
demerits of stacks. In the process liq
advised the public to invest in In
sull utility stocks.
Water, Water Everywhere
One of the parts of the top-heavy
Insull pyramid was (he Corporation
Securties Co. Its job appeared to be
that of lending other companies
money it collected from stock sales
tfj pay their dividends. When it

failed, it owed over a hundred mil- j
lion dollars; it has just a hundred ;
thousand assets.
Another company was the Insull, \
Son & Co. It bought and sold secu- j
rities. But the Federal Trade Com- >
mission found that it sometimes sold
Insull securities to one of its parent
companies at prices above the mar
ket price. With the profits thus made,
it declared dividends which were in |
turn collected by the parent com- ;
pany. This company was thus able |
to pay dividends to another com
pany, and so on. None of these !
companies had any money in the !
bank when they crashed.
What About It?
On the face of it, this looked J
crooked. The Government thinks
it is. Three of the Insull companies i
filed income tax statements for one J
year showing a big loss. Their pub
lic statements for the same period 1
showed a large profit.
But the fact remains, that it was j
the system rather than the individ
ual that was responsible for the mess
in this case. As a representative of
Ihe system, Insull should be tried—
though nothing tangible will come
of it. As an individual, Insull should
not be singled out for abuse. He did
no more than many others did; they j
got away with it; he didn't.
The lessons learned from the In- i
pull collapse should be taken advan- ■
tage of in framing si permanent |
curities Act. Then investors might
be able to hold onto their shirts. j

money it collected from stock sales
tfj pay their dividends. When it

failed, it owed over a hundred mil- j
lion dollars; it has just a hundred ;
thousand assets.
Another company was the Insull, \
Son & Co. It bought and sold secu- j
rities. But the Federal Trade Com- >
mission found that it sometimes sold
Insull securities to one of its parent
companies at prices above the mar
ket price. With the profits thus made,
it declared dividends which were in |
turn collected by the parent com- ;
pany. This company was thus able |
to pay dividends to another com
pany, and so on. None of these !
companies had any money in the !
bank when they crashed.
What About It?
On the face of it, this looked J
crooked. The Government thinks
it is. Three of the Insull companies i
filed income tax statements for one J
year showing a big loss. Their pub
lic statements for the same period 1
showed a large profit.
But the fact remains, that it was j
the system rather than the individ
ual that was responsible for the mess
in this case. As a representative of
Ihe system, Insull should be tried—
though nothing tangible will come
of it. As an individual, Insull should
not be singled out for abuse. He did
no more than many others did; they j
got away with it; he didn't.
The lessons learned from the In- i
pull collapse should be taken advan- ■
tage of in framing si permanent |
curities Act. Then investors might
be able to hold onto their shirts. j
Yesterday a prisoner was whisked
from a steamer in New York, hur
ried to a Chicago-bound train by
Federal agents. Their prisoner was
Samuel Insull, wanted for quite a
few things by 500,000 investors who
lost their shirts. The U.S. wants him
for committing fraud through the
mails. Now what did Insull do and
what sort of a criminal, if any, is he?
In his heyday, Insull was president
of 11 corporations, mostly big and
rich public utilities. He was a direc
tor in 85 more—almost a record.
This is where the trouble started.
Insull had too much to look after,
tried to make too much money from
too many corporations.
A Few Highlights
In an attempt to build up a nation
wide utility empire, Insull bought up
many companies, combined them,
.sold stocks on the merged corpora
tions for more than they were worth.
In order to be able to sell these
stocks, Insull through Halsey, Stuart
& Co., hired a Chicago professor to
speak over the radio as "The Old
Counsellor." His job was to advise
people impartially on the merits and
demerits of stacks. In the process liq
advised the public to invest in In
sull utility stocks.
Water, Water Everywhere
One of the parts of the top-heavy
Insull pyramid was (he Corporation
Securties Co. Its job appeared to be
that of lending other companies
money it collected from stock sales
tfj pay their dividends. When it

failed, it owed over a hundred mil- j
lion dollars; it has just a hundred ;
thousand assets.
