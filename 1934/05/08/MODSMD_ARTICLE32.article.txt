# BULL SESSION
## COPPING THE COPS 
### 
America is no longer a safe place
for policemen. Eabies are compara
tively safe, and robbers are abso
lutely secure; but the American cop,
hunted and abused, kidnapped and
beaten, has been reduced to a bundle
of very frayed nerves.
The average man may walk the
streets in peace, but let him don Ihe
brass buttons and blue coat of the
policeman—and he is at once the
target of organized gangsterism.
This is perfectly logical. In the war
between Ihe forces of peace and
those of crime, the gunmen have at
tacked the enemy at its weakest
point. Darwin again has been proved
right. In the struggle for survival,
the least fit are eliminated. In Amer
ica at least, the policeman as an
agent of peace has become the miss
ing link.
Patriots, who have screamed for
years that America is always first,
are at last discovering that America
is first in crime—and first in the
hearts of her robbers. The drive for
preparedness against a foreign foe
has been punctuated with the cry:

"An army and navy second lo none.'
Secure in the belief that all's well
with the homeland, the preparedness
wailers have not bothered to think
of "A police force second to none/'
We have been quite- unwilling to let
the British army outrank that of the
United States, but perfectly willing
to let English policemen catch crimi
nals, while America's "peace" offi
cers stand by and wait for the crimi
nals to come to them.
For years the talk has been of
peace in the world sense. But if
America cannot even keep the peace
at home it is a little difficult to see
how she will be able to even think
of serving as one of the protectors
of world peace. Three things are
necessary for peace of any sort —
national or international brains, or
ganization, action. If America will
use its brains, it can get the organi
zation and the action.
We fought the Civil War "To Make
America Safe for the Negro," the
World War "To Make the World
Safe for Democracy." We need an
other war, "To Make America Safe
for Policemen." —Dave Mellinkoft

United States, but perfectly willing
to let English policemen catch crimi
nals, while America's "peace" offi
cers stand by and wait for the crimi
nals to come to them.
For years the talk has been of
peace in the world sense. But if
America cannot even keep the peace
at home it is a little difficult to see
how she will be able to even think
of serving as one of the protectors
of world peace. Three things are
necessary for peace of any sort —
national or international brains, or
ganization, action. If America will
use its brains, it can get the organi
zation and the action.
We fought the Civil War "To Make
America Safe for the Negro," the
World War "To Make the World
Safe for Democracy." We need an
other war, "To Make America Safe
for Policemen." —Dave Mellinkoft
