## MEN IN WHITE (MGM) 
### 
At the Fox Stanford Theatre
Adapted from Sidney Kingsley's
Pulitzer prize-winning play, "Men »n
j White," has not suffered by the
j wider scope afforded by screen
handling.
Clark Gable, occasionally just
Clark Gable, turned in a convincing
performance as Interne Ferguson.
Myrna Loy was more than capable;
her portrayal of his fiancee received
a delicate and understanding inter
pretation.
The supporting cast was almost
without exception well chosen. Jean
Hersholt, always able, provided an
I apt characterization of the famed
: doctor. Elizabeth Allan as the young
student nurse was sincere, if some
what pallid. But it was* Wallace
Ford, as a light-hearted interne in
: search of a bow tie and a night out,
[ who made the most of his hit.
Photography and sets were good.
Assuming that such a hospital does
I exist, it provided a perfect back-
I ground for the dramatic action. One
I shot in particular proved outs'tand
j ing; the scene is a medical labora
tory, with flickering shadows of
apparatus projected upon the wall.
The plot, of course, is morbid;
i don't expect an evening of light en
\ tertainment; but it received delicate
handling while retaining force and
effectiveness. ' —Whitmore
