# THE 						LOST PATROL (RKO)
## 
### 
At the Varsity Theatre
From a group of gruesome and

' somewhat trite incidents, Director
John Ford has constructed a grip
ping drama. Each event is skill
fillly added to the pattern, which
builds steadily toward the powerful
climax. This effective development
1 is achieved by the balancing and
shaping of the sequences, the main
tenance of a fine tempo, and by the
use of subtle suggestion rather than
melodrama in the dialogue and pan
: tomimic action.
A patrol of soldiers bccomes lost
' on the Mesopotamian desert, and all
but one of its members are wiped
out by a small party of Arabs. Yet
this series of murders does not be
come ridiculously monotonous, for
with each the feeling of impending
doom becomes more appressive,
more horrible.
The psychological effect of the
I strain on the various men is well
portrayed. Each one, from a differ
ent social stratum, reacts differently
to his fate; yet, sux'ely and inevitably f
each meets his end until only the
leader remains, shouting hysterical
defiance.
A director true to artistic dictates
would have ended the film at this
point. But Ford succumbs to the
Great American Public, and we find
Victor McLaglen killing off, single
handed, all the offending Arabs as
the inevitable rescue party ap
proaches from the distant wastes.
