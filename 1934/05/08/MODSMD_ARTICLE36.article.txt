# WATER POLOISTS TO STAGE ROUGH BENEFIT SERIES
## 
### 
Wrestling will descend to Encina
pools Friday and Saturday when
Stanford and Los Angeles Athletic
Club water polo teams tangle for the
Pacific Coast supremacy.
The two will meet in a three-game
series for the benefit of the Con
valescent Home in the outstanding
group of acquatic battles in the West
this year.
Expect "Rough Stuff"
Naturally one of the roughest
sports on the calendar, the games
are destined to feature this charac
teristic of water polo, inasmuch as
both squads are considered past
masters at the "rough" stuff."
Mercury forwards, all feet and
elbows, will meet their match this
week when Gordy Graves, Wally
Wiget, Bill Woodard, and other
Stanford mermen engage in bouts
with them.
All three games give promise of
developing into six personal fueds,
with the two respective goalies
forced to merely glare at each other.
Thornton Coaches
Coach Nort Thornton has been
coaching his Cardinal brawl-artists
for just such a contest. He has
matched his first string forwards
against varsity guards in long dum
my scrimmages, and he says "the
boys are hitting each other with
everything but the goal posts."
Although the Indians will use an
open Hungarian offense, which in
itself does not call for much per
sonal contact, they will be forced to
employ a rougher type of play to
stop the American offensive of the
Los Angeles club.
Stanford has been scrimmaging an
hour every day for the past two
weeks, and Thornton pronounces his
team in excellent shape.
