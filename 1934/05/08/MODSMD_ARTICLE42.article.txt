CHAMPION
PICKS STANFORD
In the midst of the agitation on
the Stanford golf course for the
women's championship comes good
golf news from Oregon for next
year in the shape of June Bryant,
three years girls' golf chSmpion at
Washington High School in Port
land, Oregon, and runner-up in the
Women's All-Oregon.
She will enter as a freshman, and
brings with her $114 a reputation
for being a good sport.

TIMING THE
SWIMMERS
The swimming material this year
is a combination of stars from the j
good old days of last year when the '
team was especially strong, and new
talent among the freshmen and j
transfers.
In the 25-yard freestyle, Kitty
Ahrens, sophomore, leads with a j
time of 14 seconds flat, but Caryll 1
Mudd, freshman, is right on her
heels, timed 4-5 of a second slower. :
Distance swimming, however, is
Ahrens' special dish, and she clips j
ihe 50-yard freestyle in 31.8, which j
is 2-10 of a second slower than the j
record established last year in the
telegraphic meet by Florida Stale
College for Women, Ahrens is (
capable of doing 31.6 or better. The j
record is more of an indication oi'
what the others are doing than an
official mark.
LAUNCHING THE
DOPE BUCKET
The strength of the classes will be
seen for sure in the meets which !
start next week, but strength can be ]
seen now in various events with the j
sophomores as a whole showing most
of it, having a monopoly of skill in
the backstroke.
Sophomore transfers, Mary Tut
hill and Joella White, are timed in I
this event at 21.8 seconds and 18.8 j
seconds, respectively, while Ahrens j
does 19.4. White came out ahead in ,
the backstroke in the triangular.
meet in the fall.
For the seniors, Anna Louise
Aynesworth gets in some good dives ,
off the high board, with Kay Moran,
freshman, low board performer, ,
rated very good. Moran won the cup
in the water carnival.
