# Campus All-Sports Decathlon Slated for May 28
## OFFICIALS COMPILE EVENT LIST; OPEN TO ALL STUDENTS 
### 
Designed to interest and measure
fairly the ability of every athlete
in the University, Stanford's first
Annual All Sports Decathlon wili be
held May 28 29, and 30.
The competition, designed to test
the natural and primary athletic
abilities of the individual, rather
than skills which would be picked up j
through intensive training, is in
tended to include every man enrolled
at Stanford who is interested in ath
letics. It is not to be limited either
to men who have or have not com
peted on intercollegiate teams, but
any Stanford students is eligible.
Trophies Planned
Three cups will be put up as j
prizes for the decathlon, one to be
awarded to the champion each year, '
one to be engraved with the win- I
ner's name and kept in the trophy i
room, and a third perpetual cup 10 1
be held for one year by the living
group whose entrants score the
highest average number of points, j
Various coaches connected with
the University as well as outside au
thorities have been consulted as to !
the advisability of including certain
events in the program. Since this is ;
the first time any such competition
has been run off, there was no defi
nite outline which could be followed
but the attempt was made to include
tests which will be as fair as possi
ble for every entrant and which will ]
not handicap large or small men or
those who have concentrated on one !
sport.
Events Listed
The events in the decathlon will
be: football punt for distance (three
tries, average length), 50-yard dash,
standing broad jump, 50-yard swim
(any style), basketball free throw
(50 throws), soccer kick for accu
racy (10 kicks), baseball throw fori
distance (best of three throws).
Three other events which bear
some explanation will be included. J
The first is pushing the football sled
For time. "Tiny" Thornhill's grid- I
men work on an individual sled to
develop drive. The test will be to
push the sled 20 yards for speed.
This event will not handicap small [
men as the sled is small enough that |
any man can push it without diffi
culty.
Wall Scaling
Another event will be the wall
scaling test. The contestant- will
hang by his hands from the top of
an eight-foot wall. When the start
ing signal is given he will pull him
self over the wall, drop on the other
side, and dash five yards for time.
The last event will be the hand
ball serve for distance. For this con
test a line will be drawn on the wall |
of a handball court. The entrant |
will stand 10 feet from the wall,
serve the ball beneath the eight-foot
line, the test being to serve the bail
for distance. Three trials will be al
lowed.
Entries Being Taken
The decathlon is the all-University
all-sports competition suggested in
Sideline Slants several weeks ago.
The plan is to make it an annual
event in the intramural program,
but it will not be included in that
department's activities until next
year. However, the direction on
this year's contest is being handled
by Marvie Kahn, intramural man
ager, and Frank Tremaine.
Entries are now being taken. A
sign-up sheet will be posted on the j
intramural bulletin board in Enciria
gym and an entry coupon will be run I

in the Daily. Entries can also sign
