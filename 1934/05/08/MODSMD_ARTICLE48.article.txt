# POLOISTS MEET S.C. SATURDAY
## 
### 
Polo schedules, like others, are j
subject to change without notice, j
Until yesterday, Stanford's hard- |
hitting first-string riders were plan - |
ning to travel to Los Angeles this |
week-end and meet Arizona in the
final game of a series of four. Then ;
word was received that mounts \
enough for both teams could not be |
arranged for, so Arizona's chance to |
even up the score has gone by the j
boards, Stanford having won two out i
of the three games played.
Saturday will find action again 011 j
the Highway Field, when second- I
string riders meet U.S.C.'s poloists, i
who were severely trounced by the i
"first string in Los Angeles during j
spring vacation. Cal Emeis, Bill l
Enemark, Jim Henderson, and Frank j
Burns will ride for the Redshirts. |
The following week-end the Black j
Fox Military Institute will arrive
from the South, and will probably
play the second string. The first
team will again see action during the !
last week-end of the month when i
they play at Golden Gate Park in
San Francisco.
Captain Richard Gordan, who is |
completing his last year in the mili- j
tary department here and as coach of .
the Redshirts, complimented the four ,
who rode Saturday and defeated j
Will Tevis' highly-rated team. "All '
of them played the best polo they i
have displayed all year," he com- I
mented, and that should mean much,'
judging from their record of many
wins and few losses.
