# CARD COMEBACK SCHEDULER FOR FRESNO RELAYS
## 
### 
Nursing hi.s wounds suffered at the
hands of the S.C. Trojan last Satur
day, Stafford's badly beaten Indian
will attempt a comeback this Satur
day when a handpicked lew of
Coach Templeton's track and field
stars compete in the annual Fresno
relays.
Stars Will Compete
Although the Stanford selections
will not be made until later in the
week, such stellar performers as
John Lyman, John Mottram, and
Sam Klopstock, appear certain to see
action against the who de
feated them last week 82 2-3 1o
48 1-3.
Klopstock will undoubtedly com
pete in the open 120-yard high
hurdle race and will face Bob Lyon
of S.C., who defeated him in the
southern engagement after Sam lost
his stride in hitting the first barrier
and was unable to regain the dis
tance lost. Lyon ran his fastest race
of the year to defeat Sam in 14.7 and
to tie the Stanford-S.C. meet record,
but Stanford's ace hurdler is capa
ble of bettering this mark, having
run 14.5 in the Bie Meet.
Lyman to Seek Mark
Lyman, who again boosted the
shot past the 54 feet mark against
Troy, will compete in his specialty
and probably in the discus which he
won against el Trojan. Johnny seems
capable of greater distances than his
best mark of 54 feet 1 inch set in
the Big Meet and Saturday may be
the right time for him to heave the
ball further than Jack Torrance's
world mark of 55 feet IV2 inches, set
by the huge Louisianan, a .little
more than a week ago.
Undefeated this year, Johnny Mot
tram, peer of Coast javelin throw
ers, will attempt to really uncork as
he never has before. Mottram's best
mark of the season is 220 feet 102
inches.
Brazil will not seek the Davis cup
this year.
