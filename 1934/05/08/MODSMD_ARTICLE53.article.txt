# Room Reservation Due In Four Men's Halls
## 
### 
Today is the last day for men in
Toyon and Branner to reserve rooms
for next quarter.
All men now living in the two
halls must reserve their rooms, as
unreserved rooms will be given away
at the drawing of the rooms which
will be held in the Toyon office at
5:15 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.
Encina and Sequoia rooms may be
reserved for next quarter by the men
now living there on Thursday and
Friday of this week. Deposits for
reservations in all three halls are
payable at the Dean of Men's office.
