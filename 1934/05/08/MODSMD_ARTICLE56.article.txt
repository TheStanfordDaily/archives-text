charges of conspiracy to possess the Edward G. Bremer kidnap ransom money after his father confessed
having $53,000 of the banker's $200,000 ransom to circulate. Philip Delaney, shown at right signing his
fingerprint record, was caught at McLaughlin's home and held on the same charge. Federal investigators
said they found Delaney and young McLaughlin in possession of part of the ransom funds. (Associated
