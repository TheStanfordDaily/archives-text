### 
Privately endowed universities ai\2
! doing all that is possible to promote
! employment for needy students, is
j the opinion of Almon E. Roth, comp- j
| troller of the University, who last ;
| night spoke on the Stanford Univer- |
! sity Hour over radio station KPO,
I !
Faced by the necessity of cutting j
j salaries, there is no chance that pri
, vate institutions will be able to de- j
j vote more of their current incomes !
! to scholarship or loan funds, Roth '
i declared, and many have been forced i
! to curtail even this form of aid.
Figures recently compiled by a i
| leading insurance company, he said, |
| indicate that the average minimum j
I cost per student in a private educa
tional institution charging tuition of j
j about $300 will be in the neighbor- j
hood of $1,000 per year. Roth esti
! mated that the minimum for Stan
; ford would be about $900 and the
(average yearly cost to the student
j around $1,200.
J Present tuition charges at Stanford |
.provide only about 35 per cent of j
the University's income, according to'
Roth, and although there is no pres
ent intention of increasing this fee, ;
it is certain that the present charge
cannot be reduced.
"If," Roth concluded, "worthwhile, j
but financially needy, students are
to continue to enjoy the equality of
opportunity in the field of higher
education which has become tradi- I
' tional in America, more funds must ;
be provided for their assistance ;
through gifts and bequests from!
alumni and friends of higher educa- j
I tion."
