# Samuel Insull Will Arrive in Chicago Today
## Utilities Magnate Prepared To Fight Charge 
### 
EN ROUTE TO CHICAGO, May 7
! (/P). —Back to the courtroom de
nouement of the collapse of his utili
ties, Samuel Insull rode tonight. The
i fugitive landed in the United Slates
i today after his two years of flight I
about Europe.
Soon after he was taken aboard a {
government cutter, Insull showed his j
aggressive mood in his first state- j
ments:
"I am here in America to make the !
! most important fight of my life—not
I only for freedom, but for complete
1 vindication.
"I made my mistakes, but they
| were honest mistakes. They were j
errors of judgment, not of dishonest i
manipulation."
Burton Y. Berry, captor of the ;
one-time power czar, will turn Insull
over to United States marshals in
Chicago tomorrow. They will serve
Insull with two bench warrants;
charging use of the mails to de- !
fraud and violation of the Federal!
j- bankruptcy laws.
Samuel Insull, Jr., disclosed he and
i friends were prepared to raise bail j
i up to $150,000.
In Chicago it was intimated by j
j states attorney's aides that bail of j
$200,000 would be demanded.
