### 
Francis Lederer, famed Czechslo- ;
vakian stage star, will speak tonight '
in the Assembly Hall on "A Practi
cal Solution of the World Peacc j
Problem," at 7:30 o'clock.
Despite his great success in the!
stage play ''Autumn Crocus," which '
had record runs in New York, San j
Francisco, and Hollywood, Lederer j
prefers to be known for his efforts
toward the furtherance of world j
peace, to which he devotes all his '
time when not engaged in theatre j
wo^'lc.
Founds Federation
Lederer is the founder of the j
World Peace Federation, the object
of which is to abolish wars by the ,
vote of the citizens at large. The i
Federation hopes to increase its n- j
rollment in every nation until it can J
exert an important influence on i
world affairs.
Members of the organization sign ;
membership cards stating their dis- j
approval of war. When 10 per cent
of ihe population of any nation hai, j
signed, the government of the coun- i
try will be requested to hold a pleb- '
iscite.
The World Peace Federation is a j
new organization, formed only three I
months ago. Its main offices are at I
Hollywood with branches through
out the world.
Speaks at U.C.
When speaking on world peace be- i
fore the student body of ihe Uni- i
a sity of California recently, Le- j
derer stated that he would "treai ,
this vitally important matter from |
an angle that will make it come alive j
for students and demonstrate the |
important place of youth today in j
international politics."
Lederer is planning to produce a
Shakespearean or Greek drama in
the Greek Theatre of the University
of California next fall. He has i
starred in the movie "The Man of j
Two Worlds," and has just com
pleted his western tour in 'Autumn !
Crocus."
Besides addressing the students of j
U.C. Lederer has spoken before the J
Oakland Forum and at the Univer
sity of Southern California. A ca
pacity audience is expected to at- j
tend this evening's lecture.
