# Plan Dental Curriculum
## 
### 
In view of the growing importance
of the science of dentistry, Stanford
i will offer, beginning next fall, a pre-
I dental curriculum. There will be no
new courses, but those already given
i will be arranged into a curriculum
i for students wishing to enter any
j dental school in the United States.
The course will be planned so that
j studehts may complete it in a two
| year period while fulfilling lower
division requirements.
The two-year pre-dental curricu-
J lum being offered by the University
is arranged to afford a broad cul
tural foundation in the basic sciences
j to prospective dental students. The
J course not only fulfills* entrance re
quirements to any of the dental
schools of the United States, but in |
I the event that a student desires to |
I change his course from dentistry to (
medicine, he may do so by continu- ;
j ing on for one more year, and com- ;
j pleting the three-year pre-medical
I requirement for entrance to medical
! school. If he should decide that he
| wishes to study neither dentistry or ,
i medicine he may continue on in the .
i University and take a four-year j
i course without loss of time.
