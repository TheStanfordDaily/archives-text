# Junior Prom Bids On Sale
## Penthouse Setting Planned For Dance, May 18 
### 
Junior Prom bids go on sale today
in the A.S.S.U. office for $3. A novel
motif has been planned for this
year's prom transforming the whole
dance studio into a penthouse on
May 18.
Looking down over the panorama
of a city, the orchestra will play
from the balcony. Down in the pent
house itself the dancers will be sur
rounded by realistically lighted sky
scrapers. Awnings, fountains, and
trailing rose trellises complete the
picture.
Punch will be served from a spe
cially constructed bar by bell-hops
in snappy uniforms.
At this annual formal occasion
tradition holds that roughs should
not send corsages. Couples this year
will dance to the melodies of Ernie
Heckscher and his 15-piece orches
tra. Intermission numbers are filled
with special entertainment, featuring
Ernie Heckscher's guitar solo and a
vocal trio. This will be the first time
that a campus dance has boasted
of overhead music.
The members of the Prom com
mittee are Marvie Kahn, chairman;
Jim Woolley, Jim Triolo, Stan Beau
baire, Barbara Holmes, Ted Lynn,
Miriam Kropp, and Ben Cave.
