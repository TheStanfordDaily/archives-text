Climaxing the Convalescent Home Drive Labor Day, Chairman
Marvic Kahn announces that, with Labor Day today, all contributions must
be in the hands of authorized collectors before tonight.

A chance to "turn out in old
clothes and enjoy life on the Farm"
by getting a little physical exercise
is offered by Kahn, who reminds
roughs and women that no campus
eating groups will serve dinner to
night, but that a "fancy specialized
barbecue" is awaiting all who join
in the fun over at the Home grounds.
Bring Tools
All fraternities were reminded
to bring their own working imple
ments when they come over to the
home at 12:45 o'clock this after
noon. Sororities were also asked to
have sandwiches ready on their
kitchen tables at o'clock.
With Jim Triolo, Junior Water
Carnival and Masque Ball funny
man, wisecracking the workers into
activity as master of ceremonies, the
entertainment program will be the
highlight of today's Convalescent
Home events.
Jimmy Copp, Gaieties' sensation,
will be featured in one of his piano
soliloquies. Harriette Hall, also of
the Gaieties, will present a tap
dance, and Pat Gleason is scheduled
to give an imitation.
A hilarious skit by Jimmy Copp
will be followed by a solo from Er
nie Heckscher on his singing banjo.
Parmer Fuller is in charge of the
entertainment. Silver, trophies will
be awarded to Margaret Diedrich
and George Edmundson, victors in
the ping pong tourney.
Barbecue Promised
Those in charge promise the best
barbecue to be had in years. The
sororities have promised to make
sandwiches with plenty of meat, and
Mrs. Hilda Watson of Encina has
guaranteed some of her salads.
There will be plenty of coffee and
milk, and sufficient ice cream to as
sure all these who want them of
seconds.
With two of the best seats for
"Three Cornered Moon," Friday
night's campus dramatic work, being
given away as door prizes, the
