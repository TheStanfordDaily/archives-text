### Annalee Whitmore 
To boost ticket sales for Friday's
performance of "Three Cornered
Moon," special rates, announced last
night by the Rally Committee, will
admit play-goers to the dance fol
lowing the play for 50 cents; others
pay 75 cents.
Simultaneously came notice thai
sets, specially designed for the pro
duction by Dramatic Director Ha: - oid
Helvenston, will probably surpass
any previously seen on the campus.
Woman Dancc Head
The curtain rises promptly at
o'clock for the Tonkonogy comedy.
Immediately following, the dance
will last from about 10 to 1 o'clock,
under the direction of Stanford s
first woman chairman, Dorothy
Sweet. The committee named !3y
Stan Bcaubaire to assist her in
cludes Miriam Kropp, Barbara
Holmes, Julius Jacobs, Bill Wult
man, Wally Baird, Bill Cole, and
others not yet announced.
Craig's Cardinals, a 10-piece or
chestra, will provide music for the
affair, which is the only campus
dance of the entire week-end. Elab
orate decorations and an amplifying
system complete plans made to date.
New Scenic Effects
Preparations for the play include
construction of detailed and novel
scenic effects. The Assembly Hail
curtain rises on a trapezoidal set
ting, representing the Victorian din
ing room of the madcap Rimplegaio
in Brooklyn.
The background consists of ornate
wall paper, and every conceivable
type of ornamentation, in great
abundance and very poor taste. In
numerable knick-knacks complete
the atmosphere of a respectable but
out-moded and somewhat tawdry
residence, besides complicating ihe
frantic comings and goings of the ex
citable family.
Costumes Unusual
An old-fashioned fireplace, exact
replica of the type so prevalent in
the gay era of the "Nineties," has
been constructed in the rear of the
stage.
Costumes, up-to-date and modish
in every detail, add to the high qual
ity of the entire presentation. Shel
ley Smith and Harriet Hall show the
latest in feminine fashions, while
Kay Arthur appears as a blundering
Czechoslovakian maid.
Tickets on Sale
Jean Aibertson spends the greater
part of one act erratically adorned
with a Turkish towel headdress. Her
scatterbrained role, that of the odd
but laughable Mrs. Rimplegar, re
quire haphazard combinations of odd
garments, guaranteed alone worth
the price of admission.
Tickets are still on sale at A.S.S.U.
offices and at Keeble's in Palo Alto
for 50 and 75 cents and $1, with spe
cial danco rates for those presenting
"Three Cornered Moon"' ticket stubs
at the Women's gym.
