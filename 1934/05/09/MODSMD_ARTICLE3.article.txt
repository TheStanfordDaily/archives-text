# A.S.S.U. Head Issues Reply To Statement
## Editorial Responsibility Not Taken by Committee, Says Trautman Election, Not Appointment, Of Editor Championed 
### 
The following statement was is
sued last night by Gerald H. Traut
man, chairman of the A.S.S.U. Ex
ecutive Committee:
"In order that the student of Stan
ford may not be misinformed by an
editorial that was printed in yester
day's Daily, the Executive Commit
tee has deemed it necessary to pre
sent a few facts to the students.
"The Executive Committee did not
assume editorial responsibility for
the Daily, nor does the editor have
to get my permission before he can
print an editorial. The only question
was whether the Daily editor should
be chosen by the editorial board
(appointive) or by a staff vote (elec
tive). The concensus of opinion was
in favor of the elective system which
was adopted. This gives the Daily
the desired independence of the Ex-
Committee.

The following statement was is
sued last night by Gerald H. Traut
man, chairman of the A.S.S.U. Ex
ecutive Committee:
"In order that the student of Stan
ford may not be misinformed by an
editorial that was printed in yester
day's Daily, the Executive Commit
tee has deemed it necessary to pre
sent a few facts to the students.
"The Executive Committee did not
assume editorial responsibility for
the Daily, nor does the editor have
to get my permission before he can
print an editorial. The only question
was whether the Daily editor should
be chosen by the editorial board
(appointive) or by a staff vote (elec
tive). The concensus of opinion was
in favor of the elective system which
was adopted. This gives the Daily
the desired independence of the Ex-
Committee.
