# Centralization and Farce-Sightedness
## 
### 
Centralization of student control under an Executive
Committee such as the one which Stanford now has will
prove to he one of the greatest hardships on Democracy
that this campus has ever experienced.
The example of railroading which President Traut
man and his cohorts staged Monday evening is only a
sample of what is in store for the student body in the
event that far-sightedness is replaced (as it now is) by
farce-sigh tedness.
Realizing that the newly adopted constitution had set
Ihem up as the supreme dictators of the campus, the Ex
ecutive Committee members threw judgment to the winds
because they thought that their feelings were hurt by an
editorial appearing in these columns Monday morning.
They read (he truth, and the truth hurt. So they decided
lo lake it out on the offender.
During the executive session, the group told the editor
of (he Daily (hat henceforth the Executive Committee
would see to it that editorials were watched. (For addi
lional details, please read "Things About Us" in today's
edition.) '
In other words, that august body unofficially assumed
editorial responsibility for the Daily. That was why yes
terday's editorial column appeared as it did. There is not
a member of the Executive Committee who can deny that
fact.
On page one today, there appears a statement by the
engineer of the A.S.S.I*. Railroad, which savs that no ac
tion was taken. No, none was taken officially. Hut the at
tend to put the skids under free speech and free thought
was clearly made.
In case there is any doubt, the Daily henceforth pledges
itself on behalf of the Associated Students and on behalf
of fair play to battle Centralized Control until it falls out
of Ihe constitution.
