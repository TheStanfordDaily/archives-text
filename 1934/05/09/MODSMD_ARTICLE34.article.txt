## Eleanor in Blue 
### CROMPTON BANGS Jr 
Eleanor Blue is named after Mrs.
Roosevelt's favorite color. It is a
popular color. The present first lady
is also one of the most popular tna
White House has ever had. This is
principally because she is an un
usual first lady.
Anna Eleanor Roosevelt is unusual
because with about the same back
ground as most President's wives,
she has managed to make herself a
very popular national figure. Most
first ladies have thought it unbecom
ing to investigate working conditions
and thus give the President's popu
larity a boost.
Incidents
As a tiaveling ambassadress of i
Il>e White House, Mrs. Roosevelt has;
been a great success. She has filled
the place taken by the Prince c£
Wales in England; he is notably
democratic—too much to suit some 1
people—but he has added immensely
io the popularity of King George
and the royal family. On a smaller
f-cale, Mrs. Roosevelt's trips hither '
and yon have done the same thing.'
The first lady's investigation of
the worst labor conditions has also
promoted cartoonists to get to work. '
One of the most notable of these 1
pictured two miners working deep
in a coal mine: as one of them lookr,
up, he exclaims: "Look, here come.-.
Mrs. Roosevelt!"
The Helping Hand
On her jaunts to the Virgin Is- ,

| lands and Haiti, as well as on her
numerous motor and airplane trips,
; Mrs. Roosevelt has performed a real
service of her husband. It is well
known among Washington observers
that F.R. depends considerably on
her judgment as to what the people
are thinking and what they want.
If this is a fact, which is likel}',
, then the new role of a first lady as
j played by Mrs. Roosevelt is some-
J what of an achievement. It is prob
! able that it will become a duty for
future Presidents' wives. It may be
a hard duly to perform, for it de
, pends mainly 011 personality; but i!
will still be necessary if the present
popular conception becomes estab
lished.
Interpretation
Some people do not like Mrs.
Roosevelt's actions; they say she is
(00 undignified for her position. These
people are blinded by the social life
of Washington; they forget that Mrs.
Roosevelt is the wife of a President
1 elected by most of the people all
over ihe country. It is to these peo
ple rather than to the small group in
the capitol that she must cater.
Mrs. Roosevelt does not photo
graph well and speaks in a very
school-teacherish fashion. Yet the
fact that she is interested in people
a.; such and is democratic amounts
to more than all these faults. F.R.
can thank her for at least some of
his great personal popularity.

The first lady's investigation of

The Helping Hand
On her jaunts to the Virgin Is- ,

| lands and Haiti, as well as on her
numerous motor and airplane trips,
; Mrs. Roosevelt has performed a real
service of her husband. It is well
known among Washington observers
that F.R. depends considerably on
her judgment as to what the people
are thinking and what they want.
If this is a fact, which is likel}',
, then the new role of a first lady as
j played by Mrs. Roosevelt is some-
J what of an achievement. It is prob
! able that it will become a duty for
future Presidents' wives. It may be
a hard duly to perform, for it de
, pends mainly 011 personality; but i!
will still be necessary if the present
popular conception becomes estab
lished.
Interpretation
Some people do not like Mrs.
Roosevelt's actions; they say she is
(00 undignified for her position. These
people are blinded by the social life
of Washington; they forget that Mrs.
Roosevelt is the wife of a President
1 elected by most of the people all
over ihe country. It is to these peo
ple rather than to the small group in
the capitol that she must cater.
Mrs. Roosevelt does not photo
graph well and speaks in a very
school-teacherish fashion. Yet the
fact that she is interested in people
a.; such and is democratic amounts
to more than all these faults. F.R.
can thank her for at least some of
his great personal popularity.
Eleanor Blue is named after Mrs.
Roosevelt's favorite color. It is a
popular color. The present first lady
is also one of the most popular tna
White House has ever had. This is
principally because she is an un
usual first lady.
Anna Eleanor Roosevelt is unusual
because with about the same back
ground as most President's wives,
she has managed to make herself a
very popular national figure. Most
first ladies have thought it unbecom
ing to investigate working conditions
and thus give the President's popu
larity a boost.
Incidents
As a tiaveling ambassadress of i
Il>e White House, Mrs. Roosevelt has;
been a great success. She has filled
the place taken by the Prince c£
Wales in England; he is notably
democratic—too much to suit some 1
people—but he has added immensely
io the popularity of King George
and the royal family. On a smaller
