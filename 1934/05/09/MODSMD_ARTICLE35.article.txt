# THINGS ABOUT US.....
## THE 						START OF A LONG, LONG STORY 
### BOB LETTS 
It all started last Thursday eve
ning when Jerry Trautman and I
were riding over from the Union to
the B.A.C. building for the B.A.C.
meeting. We were discussing the
then - proposed A.S.S.U. Constitu
tion, which was adopted at Friday's
election.
Jerry was an>:ious that it should
be passed by the students, and I
concurred, with the reservation that
the centralized form of government
should be modified ps much as pos
sible. The example cited was the
same one which appeared in Mon
day's Daily, about the Executive
Committee not having the specified
qualifications to pass on such or
ganizations as publications, drama
tics groups, etc.
He '"thought" that would be
agreeable, and said, "If I hadn't the
Daily and this managerial problem
to worry about (referring to ath
letic managers), I would think that
I had a pretty easy term."
