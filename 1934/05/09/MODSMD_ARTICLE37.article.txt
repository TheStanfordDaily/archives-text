# "I'LL PICK UP MY MARBLES AND LEAVE"

### 
Despite a discussion with him yes
terday, I am at a loss to understand j
his change of mind. He called the J
editorial "high schoolish."
Monday night at Ex Committee, J
the group went into executive ses- '
sion, and the first bit of business was !
the reading of the editorial by Mr. j
Trautman, who concluded his read- j
ing with the remark that "this is!
typical of the way things are."
John Lyman, who I am now be- j
ginning to believe is the one really ,
capable person on Ex Committee, j
asked Jerry to explain what "things" '
he was referring to. Trautman men- 1
tioned co-operation between The
Daily and the Ex Committee.
For your information, it was the 1
first break between the two groups j
during the present volume.
