# BULL SESSION
## THROUGH THE LORGNETTE 
### 
Well, a lot of water has gone un
der any given bridge since this
writer last wrote a Bull Session for
a women's edition, in a 6-hours-flat
burst of literary genius. Ah, Pene
lope, those were the days! Women
were women, and men appreciated
it. And NOW what do they think?
"Women, women everywhere, but
not a drop to drink," I'll warrant.
But in the real of things feminine,
as the society sheets would have it,
Progress has been made; and Bull
Session (contrary to custom) raises
a lorgnette to scan the horizon.
First, of course, came all the little
blessed events with their $114 checks,
their Hollywood faces, and their
threats to the peace of the minds of
the old settlers (male and female).
There was excitement in the air, with 1
the old women giving hostile looks I
to the new ones, and the new ar
rivals deciding that perhaps it was i
not worth the candle, after all.
Then it got to be something of an
adventure. The game was to see if, |

out of 50 women, you could claim to
having seen one before—a compara
tively rare feat which became rarer
with each succeeding quarter, until
finally one was permitted to swoon
on the neck which supported Jhe fa
miliar face.
The dwelling-place situation be
came an Item. Women took over the
men's Union, adopted a motto-: "If
these old walls could talk!" and spent
their time chasing" fleeting inter
lopers down the corridors.
As luck would have it, we were
able to put on a real show for th'i
r.ovices. This happened to be Let's
Abolish Sororities Year, and added
numbers gave added zest to the
game. Freshmen were more excited,
sponsors more perturbed, Row more
Rowdy, and all God's chillun had
hysterics. The lather could be seen
for miles.
01* course, in a sense it really
wasn't fair. Imagine the plight of the
poor freshman who pledges a house
and suddenly sees the ground about
to give way beneath her! But, by

some fluke, the Fate Terrific was
once again postponed, and the show
is saved for future generations of
jittering females.

hysterics. The lather could be seen

Well, a lot of water has gone un
der any given bridge since this
writer last wrote a Bull Session for
a women's edition, in a 6-hours-flat
burst of literary genius. Ah, Pene
lope, those were the days! Women
were women, and men appreciated
it. And NOW what do they think?
"Women, women everywhere, but
not a drop to drink," I'll warrant.
But in the real of things feminine,
as the society sheets would have it,
Progress has been made; and Bull
Session (contrary to custom) raises
a lorgnette to scan the horizon.
First, of course, came all the little
blessed events with their $114 checks,
their Hollywood faces, and their
threats to the peace of the minds of
the old settlers (male and female).
There was excitement in the air, with 1
the old women giving hostile looks I
to the new ones, and the new ar
rivals deciding that perhaps it was i
not worth the candle, after all.
Then it got to be something of an
adventure. The game was to see if, |

out of 50 women, you could claim to
having seen one before—a compara
tively rare feat which became rarer
with each succeeding quarter, until
finally one was permitted to swoon
