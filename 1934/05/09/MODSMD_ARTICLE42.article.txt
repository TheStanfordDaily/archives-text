# THE 						REVIEWER
## IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT 
### 
(Columbia)
At the California Theatre
If you haven't seen this peak
comedy of the year, you are more
to be pitied than censured, for it is
one of the most delightful experi
ences that the movies have offered
for many moons.
The lightweight story concerns the
! machinations of reporter Clark
Gable to restore runaway heiress
Claudette Colbert to her finance.
The story is not greatly concerned
with facts, and things are pretty
j roundabout, and much of the action
: occurs on a bus—but none of these
minor flaws seem to matter.
From beginning to end a direc
tor's picture, this Him should set
Frank Capra pretty well on top of
(he directorial heap. He has given it
unity, he has made Clark Gable an
I adroit comedian, he has maintained
i a fine tempo, and has given almost
every scene a unique touch. And
many a scene you will not forger,
whether it be the piggy-back one,
j the hitch-hiking, Gable in the old
Ford, the runaway at the wedding,
, or the final ridiculous tin trumpet
' scene.
Gable and Colbert make an ideal
team, and without their fine per
! formance the film would not have
been nearly so charming; with them,
I it is one of the screen's best come
; dies. —Chapin
