What elevates this picture above

I the average mystery thriller is the
splendid work of Nigel Bruce as the
easy-going, casual detective who,
needless to say, ultimately solves the
mystery of what has become of some
jewels and who has killed several
; rather important people.
j Bruce gives a careful and consi.s
--| tent performance, and one senses the
j intelligence with which he has crca-
I ted his character. With voice, ges-
I ture, facial expression, and timing
; he gives force to his work.
The res', is routine but thrilling,
! and if you have even a small hank
i ering after mysteries, this will suitâ€”
: what with the trip through the
; marsh, the sinister natives, the va
rious daggers, and all the accoutre
j ments of the mystery movie.
