# FLYING DOWN TO RIO (RKO)
## 
### 
All in all, the above-average musi
j cal film, thanks chiefly to the charm
i ing work of Dolores del Rio, the
i singing of Gene Raymond, and tiic
: dancing of Fred Astaire, which latter
j steals the show with a minimum of
| effort.
The music is highlighted by the
i "Carioca," which you may be able to
| stand hearing again, I dunno.
â€”Chapin
