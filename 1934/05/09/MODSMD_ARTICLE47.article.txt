GIANTS AND
COONS ONE UP
After ihe Goons had defeated the
Giants 13-3, the Giants turned
around and with much excitement
downed the Goons 12-8 in the first
two games of the women's baseball
league, making it difficult at this
point to predict just who will come
out on top.
Since the seven innings of a game
are scattered over a number of class
periods on different days, some play
ers make the most spectacular im
provements during the progress of a
game. There are many breath-taking
moments and baseball is becoming
n very popular sport.
NEVER YET
PUT OUT
Never, no never has the mighty
swinger Helen Pauline Piner been
put out by the threatening Goon
pitcher, Helen Watters, or by any ol'
the Goons, not even by the redoubt
able Goon first baseman, Marcella
Thiel, nor caught at the plate by the
excellent Goon catcher, Mary Eliza
beth Burke.
Rivarly is keen, no significance
being attached to the names of Goons
and Giants as far as size is con
cerned. Marcia McFarland also does
a good bit of pitching for the Gianls.
MYSTERY
WILL OUT
Two "dark horses" are being
groomed for the swimming meets
which start next week. Two women
are bravely mastering the difficult
sport of diving all for the sake of the
class. Janet Wright, sophomore and
Josephine Avis, junior, are expected
to be seen in competition for the first
time when the inter-class meets be
gin. They have been practicing alone.
The paucity of divers is a situation
being remedied by the Saturday
class at 11 o'clock for divers only.
Much credit is due to Tom Boothe,
who is voluntarily demonstrating.
Bigger and better plunges are
being done with every practice. Jo
sephine Avis started at 42 and is now
doing 4G ,/ 2. Jean Albertson, sopho
more, is getting a good breath con
trol, now doing a plunge of 47 feet.
The record for plunging is held by
Margery Miles, not out this year,
who made 57 feet last year.
FROSH IN
MAJORITY
In the list of competitive swim
mers the freshman class leads in
numbers with 13. The sophomores
number but eight, but they have
plenty of "class." There are only
four juniors so far eind five seniors.
The seniors have some good all
around swimmers such as Mary Ann
Crary and Anna Louise Aynesworth,
so competition will not be so slight.

excellent Goon catcher, Mary Eliza
beth Burke.
Rivarly is keen, no significance
being attached to the names of Goons
and Giants as far as size is con
cerned. Marcia McFarland also does
a good bit of pitching for the Gianls.
MYSTERY
WILL OUT
Two "dark horses" are being
groomed for the swimming meets
which start next week. Two women
are bravely mastering the difficult
sport of diving all for the sake of the
class. Janet Wright, sophomore and
Josephine Avis, junior, are expected
to be seen in competition for the first
time when the inter-class meets be
gin. They have been practicing alone.
The paucity of divers is a situation
being remedied by the Saturday
class at 11 o'clock for divers only.
Much credit is due to Tom Boothe,
who is voluntarily demonstrating.
Bigger and better plunges are
being done with every practice. Jo
sephine Avis started at 42 and is now
doing 4G ,/ 2. Jean Albertson, sopho
more, is getting a good breath con
trol, now doing a plunge of 47 feet.
The record for plunging is held by
Margery Miles, not out this year,
who made 57 feet last year.
FROSH IN
MAJORITY
In the list of competitive swim
mers the freshman class leads in
numbers with 13. The sophomores
number but eight, but they have
plenty of "class." There are only
four juniors so far eind five seniors.
The seniors have some good all
around swimmers such as Mary Ann
Crary and Anna Louise Aynesworth,
so competition will not be so slight.

GIANTS AND
COONS ONE UP
After ihe Goons had defeated the
Giants 13-3, the Giants turned
around and with much excitement
downed the Goons 12-8 in the first
two games of the women's baseball
league, making it difficult at this
point to predict just who will come
out on top.
Since the seven innings of a game
are scattered over a number of class
periods on different days, some play
ers make the most spectacular im
provements during the progress of a
game. There are many breath-taking
moments and baseball is becoming
n very popular sport.
NEVER YET
PUT OUT
Never, no never has the mighty
swinger Helen Pauline Piner been
put out by the threatening Goon
pitcher, Helen Watters, or by any ol'
the Goons, not even by the redoubt
able Goon first baseman, Marcella
Thiel, nor caught at the plate by the
excellent Goon catcher, Mary Eliza
beth Burke.

being attached to the names of Goons
