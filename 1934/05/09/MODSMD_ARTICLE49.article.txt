# Mermen to Meet L.A.A.C. Friday
## TANK-MEN BATTLE FOR CHAMPIONSHIP IN PACIFIC SERIES Saturday Game Will End Close-Fought Contests 
### ZOE ANN HILL 
Water polo fans may expect an ex
citing series of games this week-end
when Stanford and the Los Angeles
Athletic Club, the two crack teams
on the Coast, meet to wage a bitter
battle for the Pacific Coast cham
pionship.
Three games will be played, the
first at 2 o'clock Friday afternoon,
the second at 2 o'clock on Saturday,
and the final one at 8 o'clock Satur
day evening. These struggles for su
premacy will take place in the En
cina pools and admission will be. 25
cents.
Two Types of Play
Two systems of play are to be
given a good chance to prove their
superiority in the three tussles. The
Los Angeles team uses the well
known American system that was
just barely defeated in the 1932
Olympic Games by the Hungarian
system which the Cards will demon
strate to the best of their ability.
The American attack is one of
long passing and sudden plays; while
, the Hungarian one is short,* snappy
j attack. The latter is the more sensa
j tional and open and makes for a
! very exciting game.
Spectacular Team
The L.A.A.C. invaders have per
| haps the most spectacular team thai
| has ever been produced. It includes
Phil Daubenspeck, forward; Dutch
McAllister guard; and Charles Finn,
guard, all of whom are All-Ameri
can water poloists. They also have
three former Stanford varsity swim
mers among their numbers: Wally
O'Connon, McAllister, and Cal
Strong.
However, the Stanford team is well
matched, with Captain Gordy Graves
facing Daubenspeck and Vlad Tara
nik, a sure scorer. The games prom
ise to be among the fastest and moe<
exciting ones yet played.
