the country will be competing al
Fresno Saturday afternoon and eve
ning. Bob Kiesel of California will
be there. So will Jimmy LuValle of
U.C.L.A. and Fresno's own Walter
Marty.
One of the best events should be
the 120-yard high hurdles race in
which Klopstock will face Bob Lyon
of S.C. who defeated him last week
after Sam hit the first hurdle and
was unable to regain his stride. Lyon
defeated Klopstock in 14.7, his fast

own season record of 220 feet 10'2
inches.

to better the world's record of 55
feet 1 ! 2 inches set by Jack Torrance
only a weok ago. Lyman's best mark
is 54 feet 1 inch, set in the Big Meet.
