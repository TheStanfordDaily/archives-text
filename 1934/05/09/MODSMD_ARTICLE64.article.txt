# Crime Increase in West Told by Roth Over Radio
## 
### 
"Among our social problems of
national import, probably uppermost
in our minds at the present time is
the rampancy of crime." So did
Comptroller Roth, also State Cham
ber of Commerce member of the
Committee on Better Administration
of Justice, introduce his last night's
radio talk on the March of Progress
Program.
Speaking on "Speeding up the
Wheels of Justice," Comptroller
Roth launched into a judgment of the
existing criminal situation and pos
sibilities for its amelioration.
"Following its upward trend
throughout the United States, crime
is also increasing in California. Most
of the experts agree that there Ls a
western movement of criminals;
since the vast majority of these
criminals will undoubtedly center
their activities in California, the
problem of dealing with them is
more acute in this state than any
where else in the West.
"In addition to its grave social as
pects, crime places a financial bur
den on every citizen. The last report
of the Crime Problem Advisory
Committee of California shows that
the total cost of crime in California
is annually $30,000,000. The burden
of this tremendous crime cost is
borne by every citizen in the state.
"Faced by these facts, various
groups of citizens- have been con
vening in an effoi't to formulate a
program for the better administra
tion of justice.

; "In California at the present time, j
there is no provision for contx-ol over |
the vax-ious law enforcing officers of":
the state; it stands to reason thai ;
unorganized law enforcement can- j
not cope with organized criminal op- |
ei'ations.
"To alleviate this deficiency in en- j
forcement, an amendment to the !
constitution will be proposed, in- j
tended to enlarge the duties and }
powei's of the attox-ney in genex - al, |
who would become the chief law |
| officer of the state.
"It would become his duty to see !
that state laws wex-e uniformly en- j
i fox - ced in every county."
Roth also called attention to the 1
j fact that the proposed amendment 1
! would not affect the status of dis- j
i trict officers; they would still be
! elected by voters of the county.
He concluded his discussion with j
the reijiark that the day has passed j
when each county is sufficient unto J
| itself, that it is inadvisable to retain j
1 the theox-y that each county should j
x-egard itself an individual entity. |
