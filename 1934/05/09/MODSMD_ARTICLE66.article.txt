# WE'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S WHAT

During the discussion, Trautman
and Charles (Bunky) Glasgow,
yessed by Helen Ray and John (220
feet) Mottram, informed me that
from now on The Daily's editorials
would be more directly under the
thumb of the Ex Committee. There
was no official action, but the rest ol
the group nodded its approval, and
there I was with the order.
That was the reason for no edi
torial yesterday morning.
Trautman. was very irked because
the editorial encompassed by the
heavy black border said that the Ex
Committee had "assumed" editorial
responsibility for The Daily. And
the group didâ€”although not by of
ficial action.
Inasmuch as he was sent in his
view, the editorial includes the state
ment that "In the event that he
should approve" any of the editorial
suggestions, they would be run.
