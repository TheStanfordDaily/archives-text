# Lawson Little Injured On Eve of Golf Classic
## 
### 
With Walker cup play starting
Friday in the annual amateur golf
classic between United States and
England, Lawson Little is hobbling
' around in carpet slippers, as a re
sult of a pulled tendon in the arch
1 of his right foot, Associated Press
reports.
i Little made light of his injury,
! however, and expressed confidence
that he would be all right by Fri
day, the day the United States team
engages Great Britain in the first
official match.
However, should Little's injury
prove serious, the loss of this player
! will considerably diminish Amer
ica's chances of copping the cup.
' Little was expected to come through
against the English.
Gus Moreland, another American,
j also suffered an injury to his knee,
so the odds look decidedly pessi
! mistic.
