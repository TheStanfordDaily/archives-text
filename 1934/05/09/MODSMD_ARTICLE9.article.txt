### BARBARA SWEET 
Before one of the largest Tuesday evening audiences of the year, Francis
Ledercr, black-haired Czechoslovakian matinee idol and founder of the
World Peace Federation, last night spoke fervently in the Assembly Hall
011 "A Solution of the World Peace Problem."

> Charming his hearers with his
1 naivety and ardor, Lederer made
i clear his stand on the question of
war abolishment. "War is usually
j accepted as an organic part of our
i life. It is not. It is one of the most
; unnecessary institutions in exis
| tence."
"War Is a Racket"
Why do we have war, he de
: manded. Because to settle interna
tional differences by war is im
| mensely profitable to a few individ
| uals. The killing of each man in the
World War cost $25,000. War is a
j racket. "Is it permissible to use the
word racket here?" he queried. War
! is a racket. Eight per cent of the
1 income of every nation in the world
I is spent on armaments.
After describing all that could be
i done with this money to relieve un
employment and suffering, Lederer
stated that the solution to the world
peace problem is very simple. He
evolved it, he said, at the age of 14,
just after the close of the World War.
Peacc Plan
*"I know what war is. I know
: what starvation is. I have starved
! almost to death." It was after this
j experience that he made the plan
i recently put into effect under the
i World Peace Federation. When 10
| per cent of the population of a na
-1 tion have joined this organization a
plebiscite is to be held, and a vote
[ taken to abolish war.
In the 12 weeks of its existence the
World Peace Federation has already
. recruited 40,000 members. Lederer
hopes to accomplish his end in three
years, and bring the matter to a vote
all over the world.
