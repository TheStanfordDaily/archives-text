## Cotton Expected To Decline Presidential Nomination; Mallatratt Out of Campaign; Blackman, Glasgow Run for Ex Committee 
### 
Johnny Mottrain, junior member of the Ex Committee and ace javelin
tosser of the Stanford track team, was nominated to face Marvie Kahn in
the race for presidency of the A.S.S.U. in the Row caucus at the Phi Psi
house yesterday noon.
Aylett Cotton, Chuck Glasgow, A1 Blackman, and Gordy Mallatratt,
other men mentioned for the post, dropped out of the running, leaving the
race open to a contest between Mottram and Kahn.

Cotton To Decline 4
Cotton has been already nomi
nated for the position, but Jake
Butts, his backer, said he would de
cline today. Cotton will run for
Men's Council instead. Glasgow will
be a candidate for the graduate
member of Ex Committee on the
short term, A1 Blackman will run
for senior man on the Ex Commit
tee, and Malatratt, who denies po
litical aspirations, will not be a can
didate for any position.
There was no noticeable friction
at the caucus. At the start of the
meeting Don Tatum mentioned the
fact that the meeting did not repre
sent the house vote and was not de- :
signed to bind members of the ;
houses.
No Third Party
But in the presidential race, there I
will be no bolting third party as !
there was last year, since Cotton is ;
expected to resign tomorrow and end j
the chance of a three-cornered
battle.
Doug Mann, chairman of the cau
cus, emphasized the point that the
caucus tried to break away from any j
Hall-Row cleavage. He stated that |
the caucus was merely a nominating |
machine. Nomination of Frank
Price, also named by the Hall men
for the position of sophomore man 1
was an indication of this attempt.
Revision Committeeman Cromp- !
ton Bangs advised the caucus upon I
the technicalities of the new consti- J
tution.

Doug Mann, chairman of the cau
cus, emphasized the point that the
caucus tried to break away from any j
Hall-Row cleavage. He stated that |
the caucus was merely a nominating |
machine. Nomination of Frank
Price, also named by the Hall men
for the position of sophomore man 1
was an indication of this attempt.
Revision Committeeman Cromp- !
ton Bangs advised the caucus upon I
the technicalities of the new consti- J
tution.

Cotton To Decline 4
Cotton has been already nomi
nated for the position, but Jake
Butts, his backer, said he would de
cline today. Cotton will run for
Men's Council instead. Glasgow will
be a candidate for the graduate
member of Ex Committee on the
short term, A1 Blackman will run
for senior man on the Ex Commit
tee, and Malatratt, who denies po
litical aspirations, will not be a can
didate for any position.
There was no noticeable friction
at the caucus. At the start of the
meeting Don Tatum mentioned the
fact that the meeting did not repre
sent the house vote and was not de- :
signed to bind members of the ;
houses.
No Third Party
But in the presidential race, there I
will be no bolting third party as !
there was last year, since Cotton is ;
expected to resign tomorrow and end j
the chance of a three-cornered
battle.
