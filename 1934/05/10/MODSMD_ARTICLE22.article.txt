# Vari-Colored Quad Cover Result of 5 Years Work
## 
### 
A slight, sharp-faced little man,
squinting through shell - rimmed
glasses, stood laughing in front of
his powerful ominous looking ma
chine. He looked like a counter
feiter out of a Sherlock Holmes mys
tery tale as he stood with one hand
on the starting lever.
He made a last-minute adjust
ment, shifted the starting lever and
stood back as two iron jaws clanged
together with a 250-ton pressue.
pressure. When the massive jaw;-;
opened he pulled out the first cover
of Editor Al Sadler's 1934 Quad.
Yesterday when James Flockhart,
inventor and artist, took the first
Quad cover from the embossing ma
chine, he held in his hands the re
sults of five years of laboratory and
experimental work which took nine
patents to protect.
The cover for the 1934 Quad was
really started back in 1928, Flock

hart explained, when the editor
chose a small "daub" picture of the
Memorial Chapel for the ornamen
tation. Working from this "daub,"
Floekhart developed an intricate
system of color work so that today
when Sadler chose a full-page pres
entation of the Chapel in natural
colors, he was able to have it.
Done in seven colors, the Quad j
cover is a full view of the Chapel ;
shown through an arch of the Me- |
morial Court. The vari-colorcd mo- J
saic work on the front of the Chapel j
is faithfully portrayed in natural !
colors and by an intricate embossing
process the carvings in the doorway
arches is realistically shown. The
embossing is sunk in six levels.
With last-minute changes already
made, the 1934 Quad is expected to
come ofT the press in time for de
livery on May 29. Covers will be
exhibited in conspicuous display
places on the Quad next week.
