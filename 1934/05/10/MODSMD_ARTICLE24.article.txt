# Alumni Seek IC-4A Action
## Reconsideration Rests On Desires of Students 
### 
The Stanford Board of Athletic
Control may reconsider its stand on
the question of Indian entrance in
the IC4A track meet —if alumni and
student elamorings are loud enough.
Thus was brought out in a state
ment last night by Richard W. Bar
rett, chairman of the Board. Barrett
said:
''I am perfectly willing to call an
other meeting, if there is any request
or particular demand for it."
Finances Stressed
The statement followed BA.C. ac
tion last Thursday not to send a
Cardinal squad to Philadelphia for
the national contest. Financial rea
sons were stressed in the refusal to
sponsor a team.
The general attitude of graduates,
according to Harlow Rothert, alumni
secretary, seems to favor sending a
team East.
Rothert said he forwarded a letter
from a group of Southern California
alumni concerning the question to
the Board. This group unanimously
passed a resolution asking reconsid
eration.
No Other Action
However, Rothert said, no other
organized alumni action has been
taken.
Skull and Snakes, men's honorary
athletic fraternity, is taking the ini
tiative on the campus in asking an
other Board meeting. This organiza
tion is going ahead with plans to
send one or two men to Philadelphia
on money collected at the All-Uni
versity track meet in March for that
purpose.
