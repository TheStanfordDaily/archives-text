ing with laughter, Old Boy Jim Al
gar was able to inform the world a I
large that the next Chappie is going
to be colossal.
"It went to press this morning," he
screamed, "and we've been laughing
ever since."
Pressed for details, he praised the
pressing and revealed that this of
fering was going to bird the Illus
trated Review, the Daily, and News,
illegitimate member of the publica
tions family. Algar, unable to con
tinue because of laughter, wived
weakly to the staff who gave more
information.
"We didn't have anything to do
one afternoon, the staff said, and no
money for beer, sy we decided to put
out another Chaparral, one that
would knock the spots off the cam
pus. Then we did." Upon which the
staff started to laugh and wouldn't
say anything more.

printed, an early sell-out is antici
