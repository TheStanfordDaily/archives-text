# Revision of Rally Group Is Proposed
## Beaubaire Presents Plan For Effciency 
### 
A charter providing for ihe aboli
tion of the present Rally Committee
and its system of appointment, and
the creation of three new groups to
take its place will be discussed at a
public forum at 8 o'clock tonight in
the Old Union.
Drawn up by Rally Committee
Chairman Stan Beaubaire, advised
by Crompton Bangs and Jerry
Trautman, the proposed plan is radi
cally different from the present ap
pointive system doing away with all
possible politics and abolishing the
centralized control of activities.
New Provisions
In brief the proposal involves:
1. Dissolution of the present Rally
Committee.
2. Creation of three separate and
distinct bodies.
(a) The new Rally Committee
would consist of 20 men, predomi
nately sophomores, and a junior or
senior chairman.
(b) A Women's Activities Com
mittee would consist of 15 women,
arranged similar to the men's group.
(c) A Controlling Committee of 10
members, three-fourths being sen
iors, would promote all campus ac
tivities, interests, and drives.
Appointments Planned
The proposed system, open to pub
lic hearing tonight, also provides a
tryout system to be inaugurated for
these committees, those studenls
showing the most promise and inter
est in the University receiving the
appointments, according to Chair
man Beaubaire.
Other Rally Committeemen who
suggested portions of the new plan
believe that it will do a lot toward
efficiency promoting in campus ac
tivities, and will do away with much
of the waste time involved with in
experienced persons handling affairs
out of their scope of ability.
Beaubaire Explains
Explaining the proposal further,
Beaubaire said: "Although the new
plan takes the political appointment
power away from the Executive
Committee, it does so because the
new method should promote a
strictly non-political working com
mittee, riot a 'gravy train' in the
slightest sense of the word. It
should be self-sufficient and inde
pendent, handling all activities the
Executive Committee wishes to des
ignate to their responsibility, but
responsible to the campus as a
whole."
Following the complete reading
and discussion of the charter tonight
at the forum it will be presented to
the Executive Committee for final
consideration.
