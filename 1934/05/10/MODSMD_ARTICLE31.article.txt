## 
### 
"I am not a prophet. I am not God.
I cannot say how long it will be un
til we can bring the peace question
before the'people for a vote. I pray
to God it will be within three years.''
His long black hair ruffled from
the exertion of his speech, Francis
Lederer thus expressed his fervent
hope for an early fulfillment of the
aims of the World Peace Federation:
a vote of the people of every nation
to abolish war.
In reference to the college agita
tion against the R.O.T.C. and com
pulsory military training, Lederer
said he did not favor it.
''I am of the opinion that it is the
duty of every citizen to obey the law,
and as long as there is such a law it
is futile to disobey it. There are
other ways in which students can
show their disapproval of war."
