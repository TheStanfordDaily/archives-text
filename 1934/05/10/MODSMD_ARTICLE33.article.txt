The Stanford campus has been persistently subjected
to (lie fact that its politicians, upon assuming student body j
ollices, have known little or nothing about how to handle |
siudcnl government.
I'.S.d., supposedly the rah-rah college of the Pacific!
(loast, can teach Stanford a great deal when it comes to
handling student body affairs. j
There, a sort of a civil service system in student affairs'
lias been in effect l'or about two years and, according to
reports, it has worked smoothly and ellicicntlv.
briefly, it is this: All prospective nominees for any j
student body ollices must pass an examination on the stu-,
dent body constitution before being eligible for nomina
tion. The Daily suggests that a similar system be instituted j
at Stanford. The quiz could cover such elementary, yet)
vital, things as the constitution, the by-laws, and parlia-j
iiientary rules of order.
True, politicians, normally in a hurry, would find it
rather tedious to have to settle down to a few hours of i
study to be able to qualify. That period of study, however, |
would do Stanford a world of good. It would save the i
I
future from blunders which have blotched the past.
Installation of such a system is simple, although a bit!
drawn out. A petition signed by 150 members of the j
A.S.S.I ', would cause an election to amend section f> of j
Article 7 in the new constitution.
Such a move would erase many mistakes, both foolish I
and serious, from the records of the future. The old argu
ment that elective ollicers are nothing but football heroes
and movie queen likenesses, with no ability, would be
eliminated.
