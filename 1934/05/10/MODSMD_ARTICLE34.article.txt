# Those Rushing Rules
## 
### 
While hut three-eighths of Stanford's co-eds turned out
Inst week to decide on the much-discussed sorority ques
tion and the result thereby carried less weight than it
might have, one thing came out definitelyâ€”rushing rules
slill nre not satisfactory.
Time has passed, and nobody has announced any steps
toward the improving of the disastrous set-up which
worked such hardships on everybody concerned three
months ago. Rushees and sorority women alike complained
of the complicated problems which took away the theme
of the event plensure.
If women are to derive all of the enjoyment which they
say is found in sororities, they should be the first ones to
.seek improvement. Every year the subject has come up,
and every year there has been change.
Wouldn't it be wise to review what systems have been
tried, consult with people who have seen them used - and
then modify them to tit present conditions?
