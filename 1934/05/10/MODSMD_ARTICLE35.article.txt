## Hatching Fall Campaign Issues 
### CROMPTON BANGS Jr 
As summer approaches unusual
things arc happening in Washing
ton. Congressman Snell, Republican
leader, says the depression is over.
On these grounds, he wants all tho
New Deal emergency laws repealed.
But President Roosevelt says it is
not over; we are just "On our way"
out. F.R. thinks we are not far
enough out to repeal the NRA and
the rest of the alphabet soup.
This is one of the strangest things
seen in politics for some time. One
of the leaders of the opposition is
insisting that the administration has
won its great battle, wh'ilc the ad
ministration insists that it has not.
Nothing quite like this has ever hap
pened before.
HERE'S THE NIGGER
IN THE WOODPILE
Of course, the whole point of Mr.
Snell's strange campaign issue is
simply this: those backing his stand
r.ccuse F.R. of a sinister purpose in
refusing to admit the return of pros
perity. They claim his purpose i& to
change the "American system" by
making permanent enough emer
gency laws to start State Socialism,
Communism, or what have you?
This accusation has been repeated
ly denied by the President, Secretary
Hull, and Undersecretary Tugwell.
In his book, F.R. says he is ac
complishing "evolution, not revolu
tion." At any rate, it has given Con

gressmen something to talk about.
FODDER FOR A VERY
UNUSUAL CAMPAIGN
It things go into the summer and
fall campaigns in this state there arc
curious possibilities. Will the Demo
crats claim they have not conquered J
the depression? Will the Republi- i
cans insist they have?
If this does happen, the voters \
will be more bewildered than usual, j
Usually a party in power claims j
credit for prosperity; a party out of |
power blames the ins for all the evils j
of mankind. Mr. Snell's idea would
do the exact opposite.
NATURAL RECOVERY VS. A
NEW DEAL RECOVERY
Naturally the issue will not. be left ■
in uch a simple form. The Repub- j
licans will try to show that pros
perity has returned because of the
inevitable workings of the laws of
economics (or nature); they will
claim that the New Deal has delayed j
its return instead of hurrying it. The I
next .step is to say that the emer- |
gency laws are only a blind behind
which Communism is growing up.
Some people may believe them,
but most voters are likely to appre
ciate an administration which is con- i
servative in its predictions about j
prosperity's return. If Ihe campaign i
is fought along thes« lines chalk up ;
one for the Democrats; they will j
hold their lead.

do the exact opposite.
NATURAL RECOVERY VS. A
NEW DEAL RECOVERY
Naturally the issue will not. be left ■
in uch a simple form. The Repub- j
licans will try to show that pros
perity has returned because of the
inevitable workings of the laws of
economics (or nature); they will
claim that the New Deal has delayed j
its return instead of hurrying it. The I
next .step is to say that the emer- |
gency laws are only a blind behind
which Communism is growing up.
Some people may believe them,
but most voters are likely to appre
ciate an administration which is con- i
servative in its predictions about j
prosperity's return. If Ihe campaign i
is fought along thes« lines chalk up ;
one for the Democrats; they will j
hold their lead.
As summer approaches unusual
things arc happening in Washing
ton. Congressman Snell, Republican
leader, says the depression is over.
On these grounds, he wants all tho
New Deal emergency laws repealed.
But President Roosevelt says it is
not over; we are just "On our way"
out. F.R. thinks we are not far
enough out to repeal the NRA and
the rest of the alphabet soup.
This is one of the strangest things
seen in politics for some time. One
of the leaders of the opposition is
insisting that the administration has
won its great battle, wh'ilc the ad
ministration insists that it has not.
Nothing quite like this has ever hap
pened before.
HERE'S THE NIGGER
IN THE WOODPILE
Of course, the whole point of Mr.
Snell's strange campaign issue is
simply this: those backing his stand
r.ccuse F.R. of a sinister purpose in
refusing to admit the return of pros
perity. They claim his purpose i& to
change the "American system" by
making permanent enough emer
gency laws to start State Socialism,
Communism, or what have you?
This accusation has been repeated
ly denied by the President, Secretary
Hull, and Undersecretary Tugwell.
In his book, F.R. says he is ac
complishing "evolution, not revolu
tion." At any rate, it has given Con

gressmen something to talk about.
FODDER FOR A VERY
UNUSUAL CAMPAIGN
It things go into the summer and
fall campaigns in this state there arc
curious possibilities. Will the Demo
crats claim they have not conquered J
the depression? Will the Republi- i
cans insist they have?
If this does happen, the voters \
will be more bewildered than usual, j
Usually a party in power claims j
credit for prosperity; a party out of |
power blames the ins for all the evils j
of mankind. Mr. Snell's idea would
do the exact opposite.
