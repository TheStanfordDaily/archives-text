# BULL SESSION
## MORE DIRTY POLITICS 
### 
Monday night's Hall caucus was
one of the most lack—luslrs affairs
in campus history. Out of the hun
dreds of qualified Hall voters, less
than 200 came to the Toyon lobby.
Those who did come had as much
interest in the student body nomi
nations as a bunch of well-salted
herrings.
The one spark of life that flickered
for a moment was a slight enthu
siasm for free cigars and cigarettes.
Even that died down. Representa
tives of the Phillip Morris Company
went from the Hall a pair of disap
pointed business men; they had dif
ficulty in even giving away their
favorite brand of smokes. Such was
the vitality of ihe Spring Quarter
Hall Caucus.
The ticket for a couple of the of
fices was obviously cut and dried.
Marvie Kahn was such a cinch that
but one place was provided on the
blackboard for a presidential nomi
nee. A rag doll (particularly if she
were a blonde rag doll) could have
walked into any of the other offices
without so much as a dirty look from
the floor. There were few speeches,
no arguments, and but a scattering
of boos and hisses. Interest in nomi
nation of the men who might soon
have control over thousands of dol

lars of student money was simply nil.
If the Stanford electorate takes no
more interest in its student govern
ment than was manifest Monday
night, there is practically no reason
for student government at Stanford.
Student control is theoretically sup
posed to train the future voters of
the nation to take a more active and
intelligent part in the affairs of
state. But student government as
now constituted is killing and not
encouraging intelligent participation
in the business of government.
Dirty politics have been de
nounced from the housetops and
from the city streets. But there is
one thing worse than dirty politics,
and that is no politics. The only time
students begin to blink and realize
that something is happening, is
when dirty politics are either dis
covered or rumored to be discov
ered. If it comes to a choice of the
rapid decay of student government
through lack of use, or an active in
terest in student government—even
though it be subject to "deals" and
"manipulations"—we prefer the lat
ter.
The easiest way to kill democracy
is to neglect it. Death walks the
Quad. —Dave Mellinkoff

If the Stanford electorate takes no
more interest in its student govern
ment than was manifest Monday
night, there is practically no reason
for student government at Stanford.
Student control is theoretically sup
posed to train the future voters of
the nation to take a more active and
intelligent part in the affairs of
state. But student government as
now constituted is killing and not
encouraging intelligent participation
in the business of government.
Dirty politics have been de
nounced from the housetops and
from the city streets. But there is
one thing worse than dirty politics,
and that is no politics. The only time
students begin to blink and realize
that something is happening, is
when dirty politics are either dis
covered or rumored to be discov
ered. If it comes to a choice of the
rapid decay of student government
through lack of use, or an active in
terest in student government—even
though it be subject to "deals" and
"manipulations"—we prefer the lat
ter.

Monday night's Hall caucus was
one of the most lack—luslrs affairs
in campus history. Out of the hun
dreds of qualified Hall voters, less
than 200 came to the Toyon lobby.
Those who did come had as much
interest in the student body nomi
nations as a bunch of well-salted
herrings.
The one spark of life that flickered
for a moment was a slight enthu
siasm for free cigars and cigarettes.
Even that died down. Representa
tives of the Phillip Morris Company
went from the Hall a pair of disap
pointed business men; they had dif
ficulty in even giving away their
favorite brand of smokes. Such was
the vitality of ihe Spring Quarter
Hall Caucus.
The ticket for a couple of the of
fices was obviously cut and dried.
Marvie Kahn was such a cinch that
but one place was provided on the
blackboard for a presidential nomi
nee. A rag doll (particularly if she
were a blonde rag doll) could have
walked into any of the other offices
without so much as a dirty look from
the floor. There were few speeches,
no arguments, and but a scattering
of boos and hisses. Interest in nomi
nation of the men who might soon
have control over thousands of dol

lars of student money was simply nil.
