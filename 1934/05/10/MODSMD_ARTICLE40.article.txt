At the Varsity Theatre
Anne Morrison Chapin entitled
her play "Love Flies in the Win
dow,' which is a more logical cap
tion for this picture than the name
which has been accorded the movie
version.
The married life of Jim (Ralph
Bellamy) and Tony (Irene Dunne)
is matter-oT-fact, contented, sens
ible, and unexciting until Tony sur
passes the siren at her own game
and "love flies in the window."
The exposition at the start gives
not only ihe clue to all the action
which is to follow, but the details
as well. Nothing is left to the imagi
nation, hence the audience is denied
the opportunity of congratulating
itself upon what might have been its
ingenuity.
Miss Dunne is the perfect wife;
as always, her portrayal is real, con
vincing. Bellamy as the husband is
l'air; though at first * irresolute and
undecided, his acting rises to the
exigencies of the moment of the
grand finale. Kay Johnson as Tony's
friend, slightly overacts; but. having
good lines, gets all the laughs.
Constance as the siren,
is the only poor one in the cast;
her acting lacks color, and her ap
pearance and demeanor is hardly
that of the notorious woman of the
world.
Though the triangular plot is cer
tainly not new, the lines afforded
by Miss Johnson's role and the su
periority of Miss Dunne's portrayal
make the picture one of average en
tertainment.
Good line:
Kay Johnson: "I'm tired of this
pussey wants a corner business."
