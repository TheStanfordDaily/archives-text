# GOOD DAME (Paramount)

At the Varsity Theatre
The circus background of this
picture will be disillusioning to
those who believe in the romance
which supposedly goes on behind the
big tent.
The picture is low comedy, but
more or less amusing. March as the
circus spieler is good: his part is
brusque and brutal and he renders
it well. Though a chaser, he finally
succumbs to the charm of Sylvia
Sidney, prudent and innocent as al
ways, with her usual touch of pa
thos.
Good acting and fair lines make
the picture; the plot is not unusual.

In former days at Harvard some
of the pranks played by students
there were burning the president's
home, blowing the roof off the li
brary, and demolishing the chapel.
