# INNOVATIONS DEAR TO HEARTS OF '800' WILL FEATURE NEW WOMEN'S DORMITORY
## 
### 
The new dormitory-to-be, Lagu
nita Court, has many novel and at-
I tractive features that the maids '>[
j Roble have long sighed for in vain.
There will be four units to the new
dorm, connected, but separate in so
i cial life and activities except when
Lagunita as a whole will "put on" .i
j celebration. Each unit will have a
loggia, or uncovered porch, and three
rooms in which roughs may be en
-1 tertained or studying done. There
( will be a large lobby for the whole
dormitory. Fireplaces are planned
for several of these rooms.
j The dinning rooms will be ar
| ranged in a manner different than
! that of Roble. There are to be two,
separated by sliding doors which can
1 be thrown back when a dance or
| some special event is given.

Outside stairs from the court to
the second story will add a bit of
beauty, in addition to being very
convenient. Also, lights over the
wash basins, a boon to the fair .sex,
will make their appearance.
Although Lagunita has been
chosen a.s the name for the dorm,
the four units are still undesignated.
Since Lagunita means "little lake,'
perhaps it would be appropriate ic
name the units after lakes? Or
should there be four trees (in Span
ish) or flowers growing around the
lake? Some rough may have a brain
storm and utilize his I.Q. to gu down
in Stanford history as the namer of
the new edifice.
Work on the dormitory is at pres
ent up to schedule, evidence that the
unit will be completed by the an
nounced time, September 1. All con
crete work is practically finished and
the steel girders on the third wing
will be placed today.
The wood superstructure work
will likewise be begun today.
