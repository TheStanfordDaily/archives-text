EX-INDIANS ON
L.A.A.C. TEAM
It looks as though Stanford's water
polo team can't lose this week-end
despite the final point score of the
games for the Pacific Coast cham
pionship in Encina pool between the
Indian varsity and the Los Angeles
Athletic Club team. Of the seven
men on the Mercury team, three are
former Card stars, so the FaVm's rep
utation as the builder of champion
ship players is safe whether the
present squad wins the title or not.
Doc McCallister, captain, guard,
and All-American on the club team,
was one of Stanford's greatest star.j.
The other two ex-Indians are Wal
lace O'Conner, forward, and Calvert
Strong, guard.
The L.A.A.C. squad is rated as the
outstanding team on the Coast, hav
ing represented America in the
Olympic Games in 1932. As the
Olympic team they were defeated
only by the Hungarian team that
won the championship. This year
they have an unblemished record.
WATER POLO liEFS
HAVE TOUGII TIME
Speaking of the Olympic Game?
reminds us of the incident wnicli
occurred in the water polo match
between Brazil and Argentina. The
referee was a Hungarian and it
seems that nearly every team en
tered in the Games had a different
idea as to just what was allowed to
go on in a water polo game.
The Argentines and Brazilians
were no exceptions and the Hunga
rian referee was having a hard time
making himself understood and get
ting his decisions accepted calmly
when lie did. Finally, the Brazilians
got particularly griped over one de
cision and started coming out of the
pool after the official. The latter, a
big, fat man, stepped down into the
wide trough around the edge of the
pool, slipped in the water, falling
Hat, and was immediately pounced
on by a huge Brazilian player of
about 250 pounds. On the quick in
terference of the police save the
Hungarian from a mauling.
AMDAHL RUNS
LAST RACE
Few spectators at the Big Meet a
couple of weeks ago who saw a tired
and limping Stanford man drop out
of the two-mile race at about the
fourth lap, realized they were wit
nessing the swan song of a man who
two years ago as a sophomore was
Stanford's best distance man but
whose career had been wrecked by
injuries.
In 1932 Ollie Amdahl won the two
mile in the Big Meet and a couple
of weeks later in Los Angeles staged
one of the most thrilling eight-lap
races we have ever seen in which
Earl Callahan of U.S.C. beat him to
the tape by something like two feet
to set the Troy-Indian meet record
of 9:41.9 which was broken by Ev
erett Winn last Saturday.
Last season, when Amdahl was
counted on as a sure point-getter, he
pulled a tendon in his ankle which
never healed properly and kept him
out the entire year. This year he
thought he could run, but after a
couple of weeks on the track he
found the old injury recurring and
causing greater pain than even. Ha
was determined to run the Big Meet,
however, and despite the fact that
he was unable to run during the
week preceding the meet, he en
tered. The injury was too much for
him, however, and the result was
that he had to drop out of the race,
was only able to walk with the aid
of a cane for a week, and according
to the doctors will be unable to run
for several years. —Tremaine

races we have ever seen in which
Earl Callahan of U.S.C. beat him to
the tape by something like two feet
to set the Troy-Indian meet record
of 9:41.9 which was broken by Ev
erett Winn last Saturday.
Last season, when Amdahl was
counted on as a sure point-getter, he
pulled a tendon in his ankle which
never healed properly and kept him
out the entire year. This year he
thought he could run, but after a
couple of weeks on the track he
found the old injury recurring and
causing greater pain than even. Ha
was determined to run the Big Meet,
however, and despite the fact that
he was unable to run during the
week preceding the meet, he en
tered. The injury was too much for
him, however, and the result was
that he had to drop out of the race,
was only able to walk with the aid
of a cane for a week, and according
to the doctors will be unable to run
for several years. —Tremaine
EX-INDIANS ON
L.A.A.C. TEAM
It looks as though Stanford's water
polo team can't lose this week-end
despite the final point score of the
games for the Pacific Coast cham
pionship in Encina pool between the
Indian varsity and the Los Angeles
Athletic Club team. Of the seven
men on the Mercury team, three are
former Card stars, so the FaVm's rep
utation as the builder of champion
ship players is safe whether the
present squad wins the title or not.
Doc McCallister, captain, guard,
and All-American on the club team,
was one of Stanford's greatest star.j.
The other two ex-Indians are Wal
lace O'Conner, forward, and Calvert
Strong, guard.
The L.A.A.C. squad is rated as the
outstanding team on the Coast, hav
ing represented America in the
Olympic Games in 1932. As the
Olympic team they were defeated
only by the Hungarian team that
won the championship. This year
they have an unblemished record.
WATER POLO liEFS
HAVE TOUGII TIME
Speaking of the Olympic Game?
reminds us of the incident wnicli
occurred in the water polo match
between Brazil and Argentina. The
referee was a Hungarian and it
seems that nearly every team en
tered in the Games had a different
idea as to just what was allowed to
go on in a water polo game.
The Argentines and Brazilians
were no exceptions and the Hunga
rian referee was having a hard time
making himself understood and get
ting his decisions accepted calmly
when lie did. Finally, the Brazilians
got particularly griped over one de
cision and started coming out of the
pool after the official. The latter, a
big, fat man, stepped down into the
wide trough around the edge of the
pool, slipped in the water, falling
Hat, and was immediately pounced
on by a huge Brazilian player of
about 250 pounds. On the quick in
terference of the police save the
Hungarian from a mauling.
AMDAHL RUNS
LAST RACE
Few spectators at the Big Meet a
couple of weeks ago who saw a tired
and limping Stanford man drop out
of the two-mile race at about the
fourth lap, realized they were wit
nessing the swan song of a man who
two years ago as a sophomore was
Stanford's best distance man but
whose career had been wrecked by
injuries.
In 1932 Ollie Amdahl won the two
mile in the Big Meet and a couple
of weeks later in Los Angeles staged
one of the most thrilling eight-lap
races we have ever seen in which
Earl Callahan of U.S.C. beat him to
the tape by something like two feet
