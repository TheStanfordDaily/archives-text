# Sophomore Soccer Team Meets Seniors Today
## 
### 
Captain Carl Knecht will lead his
senior soccer team against Barney
Vierling's sophomores this afternoon
at 4:15 o'clock in the third inter
class game of a six-game series.
Both teams lost their first games
last week so that the loser today
will be definitely eliminated from
the race for the placque which goes
to the winner. Harry Malorey will
referee the game.
