# Water Polo Team Hit by Illness; Graves Out
## SOUTHERN SQUAD FAVORED TO WIN TOMORROW'S GAME 
### Millard Browne 
The jinx hanging over Stanford
captains has broadened its scope.
Alter taking its toll on the Cardinal
track, it switched to the Encina
pools yesterday and plucked Water
Polo Captain Gordy Graves from
competition against the Los Angeles
Athletic Club.
As in track, so in water polo tBo
captain was relegated to the side
lines just a week before the season's
climax. Graves had a slight appen
dicitis attack last week-end, and it
has since materialized into a mild
illness that will definitely keep him
out of the Pacific Coast champion
ship series thii> week.
L.A.A.C. Favored
So Los Angeles, already a slight
favorite in this year of upsets, looms
with a decided edge as an inspired
Card squad is finishing up three
weeks of tough scrimmaging and in
stalling the finishing touches to a
tricky offensive and powerful de
fensive.
Stanford will entertain the South
ern California champions in Encina
pools here tomorrow and Saturday
for the benefit of the Convalescent
Home.
The first game will be played to
morrow ut 2 o'clock, the second is
scheduled for the same hour Satur
day, and the final game will be
played under flood-lights Saturday
evening.
Lights Installed
To make the night game possible,
a special set of lights is being in
stalled, with a huge floodlight to be
mounted on the high diving plat
form. The globe will be almost di
rectly overhead, and so will elimi
nate the glare that would be caused
by lights at the ends of the pool.
Coach Nort Thornton will use
Jack Murietta at guard to replace
Graves and will assign either Wally
Wiget or Bill Woodard to smother
Phil Daubenspeck, Los Angeles All-
American scoring threat. Graves had
formerly been delegated this job.
The Indians have been playing ex
ceptionally smooth in practice all
week, showing good teamwork, lots
of fight, and accurate passing and
shooting. Leading this parade has
been Bob Foster, forward, who has
moved up from the position of a
mediocre player to one of the squad's
leading offensive threats.
Taranik Has Cold
Vlad Taranik, with a slight cold,
may not be in condition to play all
game, and Jimmy Triolo, another
forward, is still out of condition
from a mid-winter appendicitis at
tack. Both are slated to start the
first game, however.
Los Angeles will have a team com
posed entirely of American Olympic
representatives. This group has
worked together since two years be
fore the Games, and its combination
of star players and perfectly-click
ing teamwork bids fair to halt. Stan
ford's undefeated record.
Since the Olympics, water polo,
at that time almost unheard of in
the United States, has become popu
lar and the rough tactics and excite
ment have brought increasingly
large crowds.
Starting Lineup
Probable starting lineups as an
nounced yesterday by Thornton fol
low:
Stanford — Taranik, Triolo, and
Foster, forwards; Wiget, Woodard,
and Murietta, guards; and Leo Cook,
goalie.
Los Angeles — Wally O'Connor,
Daubenspeck, and Earl Graham,
forwards; Cal Strong, Dutch McAl
lister, and Charles Finn, guards; and
Herby Wildman, goalie.
Admission has been set at 25 cents;
the general public is invited.

Jack Murietta at guard to replace
Graves and will assign either Wally
Wiget or Bill Woodard to smother
Phil Daubenspeck, Los Angeles All-
American scoring threat. Graves had
formerly been delegated this job.
The Indians have been playing ex
ceptionally smooth in practice all
week, showing good teamwork, lots
of fight, and accurate passing and
shooting. Leading this parade has
been Bob Foster, forward, who has
moved up from the position of a
mediocre player to one of the squad's
leading offensive threats.
Taranik Has Cold
Vlad Taranik, with a slight cold,
may not be in condition to play all
game, and Jimmy Triolo, another
forward, is still out of condition
from a mid-winter appendicitis at
tack. Both are slated to start the
first game, however.
Los Angeles will have a team com
posed entirely of American Olympic
representatives. This group has
worked together since two years be
fore the Games, and its combination
of star players and perfectly-click
ing teamwork bids fair to halt. Stan
ford's undefeated record.
Since the Olympics, water polo,
at that time almost unheard of in
the United States, has become popu
lar and the rough tactics and excite
ment have brought increasingly
large crowds.
Starting Lineup
Probable starting lineups as an
nounced yesterday by Thornton fol
low:
Stanford — Taranik, Triolo, and
Foster, forwards; Wiget, Woodard,
and Murietta, guards; and Leo Cook,
goalie.
Los Angeles — Wally O'Connor,
Daubenspeck, and Earl Graham,
forwards; Cal Strong, Dutch McAl
lister, and Charles Finn, guards; and
Herby Wildman, goalie.
Admission has been set at 25 cents;
the general public is invited.
The jinx hanging over Stanford
captains has broadened its scope.
Alter taking its toll on the Cardinal
track, it switched to the Encina
pools yesterday and plucked Water
Polo Captain Gordy Graves from
competition against the Los Angeles
Athletic Club.
As in track, so in water polo tBo
captain was relegated to the side
lines just a week before the season's
climax. Graves had a slight appen
dicitis attack last week-end, and it
has since materialized into a mild
illness that will definitely keep him
out of the Pacific Coast champion
ship series thii> week.
L.A.A.C. Favored
So Los Angeles, already a slight
favorite in this year of upsets, looms
with a decided edge as an inspired
Card squad is finishing up three
weeks of tough scrimmaging and in
stalling the finishing touches to a
tricky offensive and powerful de
fensive.
Stanford will entertain the South
ern California champions in Encina
pools here tomorrow and Saturday
for the benefit of the Convalescent
Home.
The first game will be played to
morrow ut 2 o'clock, the second is
scheduled for the same hour Satur
day, and the final game will be
played under flood-lights Saturday
evening.
Lights Installed
To make the night game possible,
a special set of lights is being in
stalled, with a huge floodlight to be
mounted on the high diving plat
form. The globe will be almost di
rectly overhead, and so will elimi
nate the glare that would be caused
by lights at the ends of the pool.
Coach Nort Thornton will use
Jack Murietta at guard to replace
Graves and will assign either Wally
Wiget or Bill Woodard to smother
Phil Daubenspeck, Los Angeles All-
American scoring threat. Graves had
