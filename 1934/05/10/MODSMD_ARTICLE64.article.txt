# SECOND STRING POLOISTS TO MEET U.S.C. SATURDAY
## 
### GEORGE WILSON 
Southern California poloists ar
rive Saturday for a game with Stan
ford in what will probably be the
first unsuccessful invasion of el Tro
jan in these parts this year, despite
the fact Captain Gordan is sending
only his second string against them.
The optimism is based on only one
thing—the fact that first string In
dians easily vanquished them in Los
Angeles during spring vacation, by
I a score of 14 to 8.
However, they used Will Rogers'
, horses, and this, according to Los
| Angeles sports writers, is the main
S reason they won. In order to prove
i that the southerners have a wrong
idea of Stanford polo, Captain Gor
' dan has planned to use only second
; string riders, and with both teams

on local mounts, he is confident of
an Indian victory.
Bill Enemark, Carl Emeis, Jim
Henderson, and Frank Burns are I
the four who will be seen in action .
Saturday, and the type of playing j
they have been doing recently has I
shown them to be a team that could i
play first string at almost any other
school in the country.
They have been forced to act as
substitutes this year only because j
the first string of Luppen, Rogers, j
Rasmussen, and Fulierton have de
veloped into riders who are classed
with the top-ranking poloists of the
coast.
Saturday's game will commence at j
2:30 on the Highway Field, just be- |
I yond the sunken diamond.
