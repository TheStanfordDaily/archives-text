# KLOPSTOCK, LYMAN OUT FOR RECORDS IN FRESNO RELAYS
## 
### Jack Drown 
Four world's records will be se
riously threatened Saturday night at
Fresno when track and field stars
irom some dozen or more California
Colleges, including Stanford, South
ern California, University of Califor
nia, and Fresno State College, as
semble in the annual Fresno West
Coast Relays.
In the 120-yard high hurdles, Sam
Klopstock, Stanford's sophomore
hurdle sensation, faces Bob Lyon of
Southern California and will attempt
to reverse the decision over the Tro
jan who defeated him at Los Angeles
Saturday in the Card-S.C. meet. Ly
on, IC4A champion last year, beat
Sam in the good time of 14.7 seconds
only because the Stanford star col
lided with the first barrier, lost his
step and nearly fell to the track, to
find himself eight yards behind the
Southerner with but 100 yards to
run.
Close at Tape
llow Sam made up all but a yard
of that distance in the remainder of
the race to press Lyon at the tape
belongs to Stanford track history.
Dink Templeton, Stanford's track
maestro, stated after the meet that he
believed Klopstock would have run
close to 14 llat had he not lost so
many yards in striking the hurdle.
Saturday night's race may see
Dink's belief realized, .because Sam
will have to put on plenty of steam
to defeat Ihe Trojan's Lyon, who is
now beginning to display some of
his last season's form which enabled
him to become a champion. At any
rate, the accepted world's record of
14.2 seconds for the distance, held by
Percy Beard of U.S. and equalled by
Stanford's own Gus Meier last year
in the N.C.A.A. affair, will be far
.rum safe when Klopstock and Lyon
get together.
Lyman Puts Shot
The shot-put may also result in a
new record. John Lyman, great
Stanford star, who has twice this
season put the IG-pound mass of
steel past the 54 feet marker, may
heave one farther than ever before
*.o erase Jack Torrance's mark of 55
feet lVa inches made by the giant
Louisianan in the Drake relays about
two weeks ago. Lyman's mark of 54
feet 1 inch set in the Big Meet re
mained as the unofficial world's
nark for only six days because Tor
ance then came along to establish
lis record.
Now Lyman feels that it is his turn
again so spectators at Saturday's
carnival may see the large pellet
lofted farther than ever if the blond
Lyman connects just right.
Marty to Jump
In the high jump, Walter Marty,
captain of Fresno State's team and
the world's greatest high jumper,
holding both the outdoor and in
door marks, will attempt to raise
himself a little higher to set a new
outdoor record. Marty's present best
i:3 6 feet 9Vs inches established on
Stanford's Angell Field during the
Card-Fresno State dual of nearly
Iwo weeks ago.
A great Southern California mile
relay quartet composed of McCarthy,
Tompkins, Fitch, and Ablowich, four
of the best quarter-milers in the
country, will attempt to set a new
standard for this event. The present
world's mark is 3:12.6 held by a
Stanford four of Ben Eastman, May
nard Shove, and the two Hables.
Last Saturday a S.C. team com
posed of McCarthy, Tompkins, Fitch,
and Reed galloped the distance in
3:14.4 against very little competition
afforded by Stanford.
With the substitution of Ablowich,
,vho was a member of the American
1600-meter relay team in the 1932
Olympics, and under the pressure of
strong competition from Stanford,
U.C.L.A., and California, the Trojans
very seriously threaten the now ac
cepted standard.

Coast Relays.
In the 120-yard high hurdles, Sam
Klopstock, Stanford's sophomore
hurdle sensation, faces Bob Lyon of
Southern California and will attempt
to reverse the decision over the Tro
jan who defeated him at Los Angeles
Saturday in the Card-S.C. meet. Ly
on, IC4A champion last year, beat
Sam in the good time of 14.7 seconds
only because the Stanford star col
lided with the first barrier, lost his
step and nearly fell to the track, to
find himself eight yards behind the
Southerner with but 100 yards to
run.
Close at Tape
llow Sam made up all but a yard
of that distance in the remainder of
the race to press Lyon at the tape
belongs to Stanford track history.
Dink Templeton, Stanford's track
maestro, stated after the meet that he
believed Klopstock would have run
close to 14 llat had he not lost so
many yards in striking the hurdle.
Saturday night's race may see
Dink's belief realized, .because Sam
will have to put on plenty of steam
to defeat Ihe Trojan's Lyon, who is
now beginning to display some of
his last season's form which enabled
him to become a champion. At any
rate, the accepted world's record of
14.2 seconds for the distance, held by
Percy Beard of U.S. and equalled by
Stanford's own Gus Meier last year
in the N.C.A.A. affair, will be far
.rum safe when Klopstock and Lyon
get together.
Lyman Puts Shot
The shot-put may also result in a
new record. John Lyman, great
Stanford star, who has twice this
season put the IG-pound mass of
steel past the 54 feet marker, may
heave one farther than ever before
*.o erase Jack Torrance's mark of 55
feet lVa inches made by the giant
Louisianan in the Drake relays about
two weeks ago. Lyman's mark of 54
feet 1 inch set in the Big Meet re
mained as the unofficial world's
nark for only six days because Tor
ance then came along to establish
lis record.
Now Lyman feels that it is his turn
again so spectators at Saturday's
carnival may see the large pellet
lofted farther than ever if the blond
Lyman connects just right.
Marty to Jump
In the high jump, Walter Marty,
captain of Fresno State's team and
the world's greatest high jumper,
holding both the outdoor and in
door marks, will attempt to raise
himself a little higher to set a new
outdoor record. Marty's present best
i:3 6 feet 9Vs inches established on
Stanford's Angell Field during the
Card-Fresno State dual of nearly
Iwo weeks ago.
A great Southern California mile
relay quartet composed of McCarthy,
Tompkins, Fitch, and Ablowich, four
of the best quarter-milers in the
country, will attempt to set a new
standard for this event. The present
world's mark is 3:12.6 held by a
Stanford four of Ben Eastman, May
nard Shove, and the two Hables.
Last Saturday a S.C. team com
posed of McCarthy, Tompkins, Fitch,
and Reed galloped the distance in
3:14.4 against very little competition
afforded by Stanford.
With the substitution of Ablowich,
,vho was a member of the American
1600-meter relay team in the 1932
Olympics, and under the pressure of
strong competition from Stanford,
U.C.L.A., and California, the Trojans
very seriously threaten the now ac
