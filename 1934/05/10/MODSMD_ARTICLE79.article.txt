# GUARD POSTS ON 1934 GRID MACHINE HOTLY CONTESTED
## 
### 
A terrific battle looms for the two
guard posts of the 1934 football ma
chine. No less than five men have
shown positive signs of aiming for
one of the posts already this spring".
Bob O'Connor rates first mention,
as it was he who started mo3t of the
games last fall. He got his chance by
virtue of shoving Ted Kite, the reg
ular, out of the first-string picture.
Adams, Rouble in Line
Next in line come the two husky
sophomores from San Francisco,
Woody Adams and Larry Rouble.
Some of the bleacher agnostics rank
this pair as making numbers seven
and eight of the original "six cocky
sophomores" who vowed never to
bow in defeat to the sons of Troy.
Adams and Rouble came up from
nowhere last fall to rank right be
hind All-America Bill Corbus and
O'Connor, and from the way they
are hitting all opposition thus spring,
Headman Tiny Thornhill will have
to be a magician to keep them from
playing a lot of ball this season.
Another outstanding candidate for
a job in the middle of the line is
"Crooning Jack" Walton, frosh who
showed versatility and speed last
fall by subbing at halfback for Jim
Bradshaw's babes. After a season
of rugby and discus tossing, he came
out two weeks ago and tore prac
tically a whole team apart in his
first scrimmage, causing coaches and
players alike to rank him right up
in the swim for a regular job.
Black a Contender
Bob Black, with a year of varsity
experience behind him, is another
man to contend with. He lacks some
of the poundage of the others, but
makes up for it in a clever use of
his hands and aggressive tactics. Al
so in the running are Dave Bardin,
veteran from the 1932 frosh, Paul
Spennetta and Don Pinnell of last

j year's frosh numeral winners.
Guard is not the only position
where more than two men are fight
ing for starting honors. Take, io:
example, center. Wes Muller, who
showed up well in the Olympic Club
game of last year to take away th"
regular job from Bill Bates, is back,
with all his size and ability.
Brandin Well Again
j He would be conceded the posi
tion easily of it were not for the re
turn of Alf Brandin to the line of
battle. Brandin played first-string
center for the frosh two years ago,
and was captain of the Kiski prep
team on which cavorted Monk Mos
crip, Bones Hamilton, and Jim Rey
nolds, as well as some of the Colum
bia stars. He was incapacitated last
year with an aggravating injury, but
I all seems to be well now and he is
| playing first-string in spring prac
! tice scrimmages. *
Supplanting the above pair are
three more capable snappers-back.
I Primo Pinotti, Sutter Creek high
school star and rugby regular, and
i George Bergman and Ralph Quails
from the '37 frosh all have at least
I three years experience at the game,
J and all have the same heavy-set,
j sturdy build.

games last fall. He got his chance by
virtue of shoving Ted Kite, the reg
ular, out of the first-string picture.
Adams, Rouble in Line
Next in line come the two husky
sophomores from San Francisco,
Woody Adams and Larry Rouble.
Some of the bleacher agnostics rank
this pair as making numbers seven
and eight of the original "six cocky
sophomores" who vowed never to
bow in defeat to the sons of Troy.
Adams and Rouble came up from
nowhere last fall to rank right be
hind All-America Bill Corbus and
O'Connor, and from the way they
are hitting all opposition thus spring,
Headman Tiny Thornhill will have
to be a magician to keep them from
playing a lot of ball this season.
Another outstanding candidate for
a job in the middle of the line is
"Crooning Jack" Walton, frosh who
showed versatility and speed last
fall by subbing at halfback for Jim
Bradshaw's babes. After a season
of rugby and discus tossing, he came
out two weeks ago and tore prac
tically a whole team apart in his
first scrimmage, causing coaches and
players alike to rank him right up
in the swim for a regular job.
Black a Contender
Bob Black, with a year of varsity
experience behind him, is another
man to contend with. He lacks some
of the poundage of the others, but
makes up for it in a clever use of
his hands and aggressive tactics. Al
so in the running are Dave Bardin,
veteran from the 1932 frosh, Paul
Spennetta and Don Pinnell of last

j year's frosh numeral winners.
Guard is not the only position
where more than two men are fight
ing for starting honors. Take, io:
example, center. Wes Muller, who
showed up well in the Olympic Club
game of last year to take away th"
regular job from Bill Bates, is back,
with all his size and ability.
Brandin Well Again
j He would be conceded the posi
tion easily of it were not for the re
turn of Alf Brandin to the line of
battle. Brandin played first-string
center for the frosh two years ago,
and was captain of the Kiski prep
team on which cavorted Monk Mos
crip, Bones Hamilton, and Jim Rey
nolds, as well as some of the Colum
bia stars. He was incapacitated last
year with an aggravating injury, but
I all seems to be well now and he is
| playing first-string in spring prac
! tice scrimmages. *
Supplanting the above pair are
three more capable snappers-back.
I Primo Pinotti, Sutter Creek high
school star and rugby regular, and
i George Bergman and Ralph Quails
from the '37 frosh all have at least
I three years experience at the game,
J and all have the same heavy-set,
j sturdy build.
A terrific battle looms for the two
guard posts of the 1934 football ma
chine. No less than five men have
shown positive signs of aiming for
one of the posts already this spring".
Bob O'Connor rates first mention,
as it was he who started mo3t of the
games last fall. He got his chance by
virtue of shoving Ted Kite, the reg
ular, out of the first-string picture.
