AIRLINES—One of the better mu
sical programs is that featuring Mark
Warnow, CBS, maestro, in addition
to Evelyn MacGregor, Evan Evans,
and Claude Reis. CBS uses this pro
gram as a medium to transmit mes
sages to the public, and each broad
cast includes an interesting short
talk by one of the Columbia offi
cials Dial KFRC at 5 o'clock tonight
for this airing.
"Dancin' With Anson" enthusiasts
will be glad to learn that Anson
Weeks and his bandsmen take over
the Aragon Ballroom, Chicago, this
.summer. Weeks will replace Wayne-
King, who brings his melodious
waltzes to the Pacific Coast for a
six-weeks' period. Anson, who, in
cidentally, has the best saxophone
team in the country, will open May
19, coming from his present spot at
the Club Forrest in New Orleans.
Eddie Cantor will probably not
return to the air this fall, as his
sponsor is planning a new type of
.show. It is just possible that the ef
fervescent duck salesman, Joe Pen
ner, may be shifted from yeast to
coffee and featured in the new air
