# Warning Issued: Traffic Officer Paints Car Blue
## 
### 
Speeders beware! From now on
fast drivers will have to watch
more carefully in their rear-view
mirrors because Gordy Davis is
no longer conspicuous by his
white car. Any blue car, almost
black, may hold the strong arm
of the law, because Gordy just
had his gleaming white chariot
painted dark blue.
According to Mr. Davis, he had
the color of his car changed be
cause the white hurt his eyes. He
has a perfect right to do this, for
a new ruling has been passed re
cently saying that traffic officers
do not have to go forth in white
automobiles.
