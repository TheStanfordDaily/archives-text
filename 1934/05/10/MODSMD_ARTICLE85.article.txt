# FARM R.O.T.C. UNIT TO BE INSPECTED FOR SECOND TIME
## Results Will Be Forwarded To Dr. Wilbur Soon 
### 
For the second military inspection
in as many weeks, Lt. Col. John R.
Slarkey from Oakland will visit the
campus next Monday and Tuesday,
May 14 and 15, to conduct the an
nual tactical inspection of the local
Field Artillery R.O.T.C. unit, it was
learned yesterdya from Major E. C.
Williams of the military department.
This inspection, which will be of
an informal nature, will cover all
phases of instruction in the Field
Artillery branch offered in the local
department. Theoretical military
classes on the Quad will be visited
on both mornings, and afternoon
drills by Monday and Tuesday drill
sections will be watched by Col.
Starkey. This inspection of the drill
will be of a much more thorough
and complete natui'e than General
Cheney's visit two weeks ago, Major
Williams stated. Battery and caisson
drill and maneuvers will be closely
watched by the inspector, who is an
expert on artillery drill.
The results of this inspection and
the one made by Brigadier General
Sherwood A. Cheney on May 3,
which was principally administra
tive, will be combined in the final
assignment of an annual efficiency
rating to the local R.O.T.C. by the
War Department. A report of the
results will be forwarded in the near
future to the president of the Uni
versity by the commanding general
of the 9th Corps Area. Stanford's
unit has, incidentally, received the
highest rating every year since these
inspections were inaugurated here.
Col. Starkey is a graduate of the
Military Academy at West Point in
the class of 1905, as well as several
army technical schools among which
are the Command and General Staff
School, the Army School of the Line,
and the Field Artillery School, in
both the battery commanders and
advanced courses.
