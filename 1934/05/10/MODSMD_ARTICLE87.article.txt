# Scientists Seek Nature Of Fat-Reducing Drug
## 
### 
The discovery, a short time ago, of
the drug 2-4-dinitrophenol, in com
mon parlance, a drug which reudces
fat, has started many experiments
to find the exact nature of the drug.
Dr. Tainter and others of San Fran
cisco have been experimenting ex
tensively.
Dr. Field, assistant professor of
physiology at Stanford, working will)
Mr. A. W. Martin, has made two
valuable contributions to the knowl
edge of the fundamental action of
dinitrophenol. At present the drug
is on the market, but owing to the
numerous recent deaths resulting
from its misuse, it may be made un
available to the general public.
The two important contributions of
Dr. Field are the discovery of the
fact that the durg is active in the
free acid form, and that the action
is reversible.
Carrying on the experiments with
yeast because the chemical environ
ment of yeast can be varied a great
deal, it was found that the drug in
creases oxygen consumption only in
its free acid form, which it also stim
ulates fermentation by yeast. How
ever, when the concentration of the
fi'ee acid form reachcs a certain
point, the stimulation is replaced by
inhibition, and oxygen consumption
falls.
The drug can be made, but the
laboratory obtains its supply from a
kodak company, where it is an in
termediary in the manufacture of
developers.
Since 2-4-dinitrophenol reduces

â–  fat when taken internally, the seek
; er-after-slimness may eat anything
he wishes. However, it is very dan
gerous, because when taken in too
great amounts, the result is fatal.
Last week a young woman in Los
Angeles was killed by an overdose.
While the scientists consider the
drug a very important discovery,
they believe that it should be re-
I moved from public sale because of
its fatality, and should be taken only
under doctor's orders. Dr. Field
stressed the danger of trying to take
2-4-dinitrophenol on one's own.
