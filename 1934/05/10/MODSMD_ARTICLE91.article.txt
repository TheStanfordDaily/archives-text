# DR. BLACKWELDER SPEAKS ON MATH, GEOLOGY PROBLEMS
## Questions in Department Are Answered 
### 
Before the smallest audience yet
to attend a major department lec
ture, Professor Eliot Blacky/elder,
executive head of geology, last night
spoke on questions relating to the
Department of Geology and read a
paper on Mathematics written by
Professor Hans F. Blichfeldt.
Three types of students usually do
wejl in the study of mathematics,
Professor Blichfeldt believes. First,
those who a ,- e interested in the sub
ject above all others; second, those
who expect to become mathemati
cians, scientists, engineei's, or as
trologers; third, those who have no
special ability but a genuine interest
in the field.
After concluding his reading on
mathematics Professor Blackwelder
went on to explain his own depart
ment, telling of the different sciences
included, the relationship of geology
to the other sciences, and the re
quirements for graduation.
"Those that succeed in geology,"
Blackwelder said, "usually are clear
thinkers, hard workers, can adapt
themselves to different situations,
and have the ability to reason ac
cording to cause and effect."
Departing from his .serious trend
of explanations, Professor Black
welder told of unusual experiences
encountered on summer field trips
and of the varied situations that a
geologist meets with while wander
ing about in open country.
In speaking of independent study
in geology, Blackwelder stated that
it was nothing new for the depart
ment since students had been doing
individual work since 1892. He also
frankly admitted that opportunities
for positions in the field are poor at
present but that he felt that there
would be considerable enlargement
of the field within the next few years.
