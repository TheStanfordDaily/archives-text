LIGHT food is the kind that
will keep the brain in action.
So start ilie day with
Kellogg's Rice Krispies.
Those crisp, crunchy rice
hu (titles with milk or cream
appeal to the taste and fur- j
nish energy you need.
Rice Krispies at lunch are
also ideal. Won't hog you
down. And at the end of the
day — when hungry and
tired—Rice Krispies satisfy
the appetite and promote
sound sleep.
Ask for Kclhtgg's Rice
Krispies at your campus
restaurant, fraternity house
or eating cluh. Made lty
Kellogg in Battle Creek.
