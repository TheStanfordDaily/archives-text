# WATER POLISTS MEET LAAC MEN IN THREE GAMES
## Rivals Clash in Encina Pools Today, Tomorrow To Gain Pacific Coast Championship; Triolo, Taranik Will Play 
### MILLARD BROWNE 
A young, speedy, active Stanford varsity water polo team will line up
against an experienced, skillful Los Angeles Athletic squad this afternoon
at 2 o'clock in Encina pools as the Northern California title holder begins a
three-game series with the best in the South for the Pacific Coast cham
pionship.

Stanford and Los Angeles will<
clash again tomorrow afternoon at |
the same time and will wind up the
series with a night game tomorrow
at 8 o'clock.
Club Practices
The club team arrived on the
Farm last night and both teams
ended their practice yesterday with
the visitors holding a decided edge
on advance predictions.
An offensive ray of hope served to
partially offset Coach Nort Thorn
ton's defensive despair yesterday
when Vlad Taranik, who has been
suffering from a cold, was reported
much better and is in shape to play
a full game. Jimmy Triolo, another
partial cripple because of a mid
winter appendicitis attack, is also
ready to go nearly all game.
Graves May Play
Gordy Graves, captain and all
conference guard, who yesterday
was announced as definitely out of
the games, may be able to play for a
minute or two in each of the games.
However, Thornton does not count
on using the captain unless the score
is tied late in the game and he sees
a necessity for smothering Phil Dau
benspeck, LA.A.C. ail-American
forward.
The southerners average 13 years
of experience in water polo. They
have worked together for five years,
and each member of the squad had
played college and club water polo
previous to their organization into j
a team. . i
Los Angeles, then, will have a
distinct advantage in teamwork. But
Stanford may offset this by showing
more spirit and speed.
All-Americans Play
Three ail-Americans will swim for |
the southerners in the series. Be
sides Daubenspeck, the Mercuries
claim the two best guards in the
country in Dutch McAllister and
Charles Finn. McAllister is a for- ■
mer Stanford ace, as are Wally J
O'Connor and Cal Strong, also mem
bers of the LA.A.C. starting lineup.
Stanford, with her speed, will rely
on an open deceptive Hungarian
type of play, while the favored visi
tors will play a conservative, long
passing American game. The Hun
garian game, demonstrated by the
originators, defeated Los Angeles in,
the Olympic finals in 1932.
Cards on Defense
Because of developments in the !
Stanford practice sessions, the games J
probably will end in fairly high ;
scores. With crippled forwards, the i
Cards originally planned an air-tight j
defense, with three powerful guards'
—Graves, Wally Wiget, and Bill
Woodard—smothering the ace Los;
Angeles forwards.
But with Graves out, the Mer
curies are almost certain to run up
a sizeable score. The Indians, how- 1
ever, on the basis of recent scrim
mage performances, give promise of
matching this. Bob Foster, a new
addition to Cardinal forces this year,
has shown himself to be a distinct j
offensive threat. In workouts, espe
cially this week, Foster has shown
speed, deception, accurate passing,
and clever shooting.
To top it off, the Hungarian play
calls for offensive work from every
member of the team except the
goalie, and the three guards arc also
potential scorers. This will serve to (
decentralize the Los Angeles de
fense.
The efficient club team has long ,
been noted for its rough type of
game, and Thornton's team has given
evidence during its regular confer
ence season of cheerfully matching
any roughhouse tactics it runs up |
against. Consequently, the series j
may develop into six personal duels, i
Admission wfll be 25 cents.

A young, speedy, active Stanford varsity water polo team will line up
against an experienced, skillful Los Angeles Athletic squad this afternoon
at 2 o'clock in Encina pools as the Northern California title holder begins a
three-game series with the best in the South for the Pacific Coast cham
pionship.

Stanford and Los Angeles will<
clash again tomorrow afternoon at |
the same time and will wind up the
series with a night game tomorrow
at 8 o'clock.
Club Practices
The club team arrived on the
Farm last night and both teams
ended their practice yesterday with
the visitors holding a decided edge
on advance predictions.
An offensive ray of hope served to
partially offset Coach Nort Thorn
ton's defensive despair yesterday
when Vlad Taranik, who has been
suffering from a cold, was reported
much better and is in shape to play
a full game. Jimmy Triolo, another
partial cripple because of a mid
winter appendicitis attack, is also
ready to go nearly all game.
Graves May Play
Gordy Graves, captain and all
conference guard, who yesterday
was announced as definitely out of
the games, may be able to play for a
minute or two in each of the games.
However, Thornton does not count
on using the captain unless the score
is tied late in the game and he sees
a necessity for smothering Phil Dau
benspeck, LA.A.C. ail-American
forward.
The southerners average 13 years
of experience in water polo. They
have worked together for five years,
and each member of the squad had
played college and club water polo
previous to their organization into j
a team. . i
Los Angeles, then, will have a
distinct advantage in teamwork. But
Stanford may offset this by showing
more spirit and speed.
All-Americans Play
Three ail-Americans will swim for |
the southerners in the series. Be
sides Daubenspeck, the Mercuries
claim the two best guards in the
country in Dutch McAllister and
Charles Finn. McAllister is a for- ■
mer Stanford ace, as are Wally J
O'Connor and Cal Strong, also mem
bers of the LA.A.C. starting lineup.
Stanford, with her speed, will rely
on an open deceptive Hungarian
type of play, while the favored visi
tors will play a conservative, long
passing American game. The Hun
garian game, demonstrated by the
originators, defeated Los Angeles in,
the Olympic finals in 1932.
Cards on Defense
Because of developments in the !
Stanford practice sessions, the games J
probably will end in fairly high ;
scores. With crippled forwards, the i
Cards originally planned an air-tight j
defense, with three powerful guards'
—Graves, Wally Wiget, and Bill
Woodard—smothering the ace Los;
Angeles forwards.
But with Graves out, the Mer
curies are almost certain to run up
a sizeable score. The Indians, how- 1
ever, on the basis of recent scrim
mage performances, give promise of
matching this. Bob Foster, a new
addition to Cardinal forces this year,
has shown himself to be a distinct j
offensive threat. In workouts, espe
cially this week, Foster has shown
speed, deception, accurate passing,
and clever shooting.
To top it off, the Hungarian play
calls for offensive work from every
member of the team except the
goalie, and the three guards arc also
potential scorers. This will serve to (
decentralize the Los Angeles de
fense.
The efficient club team has long ,
been noted for its rough type of
game, and Thornton's team has given
evidence during its regular confer
ence season of cheerfully matching
any roughhouse tactics it runs up |
against. Consequently, the series j
may develop into six personal duels, i
Admission wfll be 25 cents.
