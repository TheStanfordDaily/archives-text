# Kidnap Gettle, Oil Millionaire, At Swim Party
## Local Newspapers Receive Intermediate Offer Signed in Crypt Family Promises to Pay "Reasonable Ransom" 
### 
ARCADIA, May 10 (A*).—A vi
cious arm of the snatch racket
seized William F. Gettle, oil million
naire, at the end of a midnight
swimming party and withdrew him
into the half-world where money
and pistols generally do the talking.
A typewritten note, written on
stationery of the Whitcomb Hotel of
San Francisco and signed "Bill-611-
Colonial Style," offering the writer's
services as intermediary for Gettle's
release was delivered to a Los An
geles paper late today. The note
stated that Gettle was the only one
who would know him by the signa
ture.
Manhunt Starts
Every law enforcement agency in
Southern California jumped into the
case as the hide-out of the kidnap
gang was thought to be in the
Sierra Nevada range between Pasa
dena and San Bernardino. Ernest
E. Noon, Beverly Hills lawyer and
spokesman for the stricken family,
proclaimed a desire to deal directly
with the abductors and pay "any
reasonable ransome demand."
Members of Gettle's party who
were celebrating the completion of
the pool of his newly-acquired es
tate. All those at the pool except
Gettle and James P. Wolf, Westwood
furniture dealer, retired to the
house.
Two Masked Gunmen
Host and guest went to the recrea
tion hall to change from their bath
ing clothes and chat and drink.
Wolf said footsteps were heard on
the walk and a soft voice said: "Put
'em up, gentlemen."
Looking up, Gettle and Wolf saw
two young men, apparently Ameri
cans, masked with handkerchiefs
and armed with pistols.
The gunmen ordered Gettle and
Wolf to go on talking as they
marched them to the east wall of
the estate, 100 yards away. Wolf
thought it was a hold-up and tossed
his purse into the shrubbery. The
gunmen said nothing until the wall
was reached, when one said:
"This is not a heist (hold-up) —
it's a snatch!"
The kidnapped man is reputedly a
millionaire many times over. Friends
describe him as a quiet, charitable,
friendly man, who made his for
tune by shrewd investments and
hard work.
