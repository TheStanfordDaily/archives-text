# John Lyman, Klopstock To Enter ICAAAA
## Skull and Snakes To Send Representatives East 
### 
Using $438 netted from the all-
University meet held two months
ago, Skull and Snakes has definitely
decidcd to send a two-man team of
Sam Klopstock and John Lyman to
the IC4A meet to be held May 26 in
Philadelphia.
The men were selected from a list
suggested by Dink Templeton, and
are figured as the surest point-get
ters. The possibility of sending other
athletes on the suggested list, in
cluding Johnny Mottram, "Slinger"
Dunn, A1 Blackman, Chuck Nimmo,
and Bud Deacon rests with the
BA.C. and with alumni groups.
According to Richard W. Barrett,
chairman of the BA.C., no further
meetings will be held unless called
by student Board members, Ray
Wilbur, Jr., Chuck White, and Jerry
Trautman.
Alumni, although clamoring for
reconsideration of the Board's orig
inal action, have made no official
moves except the Los group
who unanimously passed a resolu
tion favoring the trip.
The two men, selected because
they have chances in more than one
event, may be good for between 15
and 18 points, v/hich would give
Stanford a second or third ranking
in the meet.
Lyman should win the shot with
out Torrance to compete against,
and might be able to pick up a few
points in the discus. Klopstock has
fast times in the low and high hur
dles, and is capable of winning both
barrier events.
