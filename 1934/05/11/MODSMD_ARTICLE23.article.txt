Swimming without; the proper j

I joyed by Stanford students, as re- (
' search reveals that a total of 79 per
sons bade farewell to their canoes
' and enjoyed a trip to the watery i
deep during the period of Lagunita's
supremacy, from March 10 to April (
15 this spring.
Encina inmates seem to have been j
the ones most in need of a bath, for
32 of them were submerged, while
Phi Dells with ihcir newly remod
eled house, had only one brother
who felt it necessary to perform his
ablutions in Lagunita. Roble ranks
next to Encina, having had 10 maid
ens turned over, and the Zetes and
Delts coming next with nine and 10
persons, respect ively.
Toyon registers live misluips, while j

Sequoia and Kappa Sigs each bear
witness to three. Delta Chi, Phi
Kaps, Fijis, and Chi Psis each con
tributed two persons to the tolal.
Friday proved the most popular
day to decide to investigate Lagu
nita's murky depths, with 16 canoes
being turned over then. Saturday
shows 12, Wednesday and Thursday
nine, Tuesday and Sunday six, and
Monday only two.
Afternoon from 2 to 6 o'clock saw
the most number of accidents, for 38
of the casualties occurred during
these hours. Five canoes overturned
during the morning, and throe in the
evening.
Contrary to the belief that it is
"great sport" for a man to turn a girl
over in a canoe, statistics show t hut
this year only two canoes occupied
by couples were submerged.
