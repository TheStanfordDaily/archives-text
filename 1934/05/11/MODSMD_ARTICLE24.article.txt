# Curtain Goes Up Tonight For Three Cornered Moon'
## 
### ANNALEE WHITMORE 
With stage set, cast in readiness, '
and a successful dress rehearsal al
ready past history, final preparations
have been concluded for tonight's j
production of "Three Cornered
Moon"—time, 8:30 o'clock; place,
Assembly Hall; admission, 50 and 75
cents and $1.
"The cast has derived more actual
enjoyment from the preparation of
this comedy than any other I recall,"
commented Dramatic Director Har
old Helvenston. The play he con
siders one of the most entertaining
to grace the Assembly Hall stage,
specially chosen to appeal to cam
pus audiences as the last spring dra
matic production.
According to Ben Cave, manager,
the farce contains all the elements
that make for an enjoyable perform
ance. Gertrude Tonkonogy's opus,
which starred Claudette Colbert and
Richard Arlen in one of the box
office movie hits of last season, is
scened in Brooklyn.
Characters provide opportunity
for one of the most fast-moving
comedies of the year. Lines, action,
are keyed to a rapid tempo, abound
ing in ludicrous situations.
The cast, comprising nine widely
experienced campus dramatists, is
as follows:
Mrs. Rimplegar Jean Albertson
Elizabeth Rimplegar. .Shelley Smith
Kenneth Rimplegar... .James Benet
Jenny the maid Kay Arthur
Dr. Alan Stevens Pete Peck
Donald, a poet Robert Balzer
Kitty, a flapper Harriet Hall
Douglas Rimplegar Neal Berry
Ed Rimplegar Joe Chamberlin
A last-minute dispatch from the
dramatic office last night revealed
that a radio broadcast of the play,
slated tentatively for next Thursday
evening over station KFRC, was
definitely vetoed last night by Pres
ident Ray Lyman Wilbur.
Fear that Robert Balzer, who suf
fered an attack of appendicitis early
in the week, or Pete Peck, injured
in soccer, would be unable to play
has been proved groundless. Both

have recovered, and will appear this
evening.
Last touches on. costumes were
completed last night. Comic charac
i ters of Mrs. Rimplegar and the maid
afforded particularly good possibili
ties, as the former is laughably ec
centric; and the latter queerly
clothed because, in the words of one
of the Rimplegars, "no one in the
family knew how to dress a maid
except Kenneth, and he didn't want
to."
An extensive publicity drive ter
minates today with the posting of
cast caricatures, the work of Gilman
Gist, on the Engineering corner.

evening over station KFRC, was
definitely vetoed last night by Pres
ident Ray Lyman Wilbur.
Fear that Robert Balzer, who suf
fered an attack of appendicitis early
in the week, or Pete Peck, injured
in soccer, would be unable to play
has been proved groundless. Both

have recovered, and will appear this
evening.
Last touches on. costumes were
completed last night. Comic charac
i ters of Mrs. Rimplegar and the maid
afforded particularly good possibili
ties, as the former is laughably ec
centric; and the latter queerly
clothed because, in the words of one
of the Rimplegars, "no one in the
family knew how to dress a maid
except Kenneth, and he didn't want
to."
An extensive publicity drive ter
minates today with the posting of
cast caricatures, the work of Gilman
Gist, on the Engineering corner.
With stage set, cast in readiness, '
and a successful dress rehearsal al
ready past history, final preparations
have been concluded for tonight's j
production of "Three Cornered
Moon"—time, 8:30 o'clock; place,
Assembly Hall; admission, 50 and 75
cents and $1.
"The cast has derived more actual
enjoyment from the preparation of
this comedy than any other I recall,"
commented Dramatic Director Har
old Helvenston. The play he con
siders one of the most entertaining
to grace the Assembly Hall stage,
specially chosen to appeal to cam
pus audiences as the last spring dra
matic production.
According to Ben Cave, manager,
the farce contains all the elements
that make for an enjoyable perform
ance. Gertrude Tonkonogy's opus,
which starred Claudette Colbert and
Richard Arlen in one of the box
office movie hits of last season, is
scened in Brooklyn.
Characters provide opportunity
for one of the most fast-moving
comedies of the year. Lines, action,
are keyed to a rapid tempo, abound
ing in ludicrous situations.
The cast, comprising nine widely
experienced campus dramatists, is
as follows:
Mrs. Rimplegar Jean Albertson
Elizabeth Rimplegar. .Shelley Smith
Kenneth Rimplegar... .James Benet
Jenny the maid Kay Arthur
Dr. Alan Stevens Pete Peck
Donald, a poet Robert Balzer
Kitty, a flapper Harriet Hall
Douglas Rimplegar Neal Berry
Ed Rimplegar Joe Chamberlin
A last-minute dispatch from the
dramatic office last night revealed
that a radio broadcast of the play,
slated tentatively for next Thursday
evening over station KFRC, was
definitely vetoed last night by Pres
ident Ray Lyman Wilbur.
