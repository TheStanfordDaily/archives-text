## The 						New Deal Goes International

19:13—NATIONAL AN!)
—International
A year ago the New Deal was
decidedly along nationalistic lines;
little attention was given to the out
side world in the recovery program.
This year the New Deal is taking on
an international tinge. This does not
mean that last year's program has
fallen down and has to be aban
doned. It simply means that the
limitations of purely national re
covery have been spotted.
In the administration this change
is shown by F.R.'s determined at
tempt to expand international trade
by lowering tariffs. In order to do
this, he has asked Congress for the
power to dicker and bargain with
foreign nations. Just now, it looks
as though he will get it. Last year,
with Congress eating out of his hand,
he did not even try.
EVEN CONGRESS (JOES
INTERNATIONAL—BUT
This tendency has shown itself
rather clearly in Congress. But here
it has taken the form of a demand
to raise the price of silver. This
remedy would have little effect in
the U.S., but it would raise prices
abroad. Since it would raise prices
abroad, it would raise the prices
American farmers get for cotton,
wheat, etc. This is why Congress
wants higher silver prices.
If Congress thought all the U.S.
needed to regain prosperity was a
good dose of domestic inflation, it
would advocate printing more mon
ey. Since it wants to raise world

I prices — not just American prices —
Congress wants higher silver prices.
REASONS FOR
LOOKING ABROAD
A year ago, President Roosevelt
had to put his own house in order
before looking abroad. The things
which had to be done were all do
mestic in character. The banks had
to be reopened and stabilized; this
was done. The dollar had to be
brought down into line with the
English pound; he did this by fol
lowing their own example—by mak
ing the dollar worth less in gold.
The jobless, the farmers, the debt
ors and sick industries had to be
helped. The CWA, the AAA, the
Home Owners' Loan, and the NRA
did these things. Up to now, the
U.S. had done this all alone, and we
1 have recovered to where we were
in Ihe middle of 1931—when inter
national prices crashed.
BUT STILL m.'il
WAS NOT 1029
Although 1931 was not a terribly
; bad year, it was not a very good
l year either. In other words, to re
cover any more the U.S. will have
j to get back most of our lost foreign
trade. If we fail to get it back, we
will have to clamp down on indus
i try and farmers and restrict pro
duction. This will lower the Amer
; ican standard of living.
This is why both Congress and
the President are looking abroad at
the same lime, and almost for the
first time. True, they are looking in
different directions, but they are still
j looking.
