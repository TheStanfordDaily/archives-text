I
j THE PULITZER PRIZE WINNER
AM) SOME OTHERS
Over the selection of "Men in
1 White" for the 1934 Pulitzer Prize
honors there rages a considerable
j battle. There are a half dozen fac
' tions, each anxious to protest on be
i half of some of the season's plays.
"Mary of Scotland" by Maxwell
Anderson, O'Neill's "Ah Wiider
j ness!" the dramatized version of
i Caldwell's "Tobacco Road," and the
musical farce "Sh? Loves Me Not"
are the chief disappointed contend-
I ers.
All things considered, the O'Neill
I play seems to me to have the greatest
| merit ol the lot. Unfortunately it is
j a comedy by a man from whom dank
,i tragedy is ordinarily expected and
! as such has been damned as "trivial"
j and dismissed as a trifle.
On the contrary, it i.s good genre
' comedy, written with great facility
i and possessing a considerable de
j gree of genuine humor. Unlike "Men
, in White," it has no thesis; unlike
i "Tobacco Road," it does not depend
| in representation upon the perform
j ance of a single star—although
| George Cohan's characterization has
I done ample justice to the role itself.
1 Unlike "Mary of Scotland," it is a
well-constructed play; for Anderson
j in his drama has employed a rriethod
! of exposition as old—and now as
I unnecessarily—as that used by the
| Elizabethans.
"Men in White" is not important
! as a play; it is, to be sure, a smooth
| Iy-made piece containing most of
; the elements of melodrama with a
thesis concerning doctoring and a
| sensationally staged scene in an op
j crating room.
! But the dilemma is too palpably j
! concocted and too neatly fitted into
j a smooth finale to be sincerely af- |
| fecting. It is a competent piece of
| imaginative reporting but no more.
"Ah, Wilderness!" should not bs
' held up as a great play, but its own
j very real and human qualities should
j not be overlooked, either. If it is
j not O'Neill's greatest play, it pos-
I ses.ses a degree of workmanship,
t sincerity, and authenticity which
| none of the others do. —Sandoe
THE DRUNKARD (Shobc and Bell)
At the Palace Hotel
It's too bad that we younger peo-
I pie never could have the chance to
■ see some of the old-fashioned mo
i rality plays produced before the
; turn of the century. One of them,
| "The Drunkard, or, The Fallen
j Saved," is being produced this week
! at the Palace. You should see it.
! With two former Stanford drama-
I tics stars, Miss Peggy Converse and
Vallejo Gantner, occupying the spot
! light much of the time, the five-act
j opus swings from the heights of
j martial bliss to the depths of despair,
j and again to the heights of martial
' bliss—and in one evening and with a.
I moral attached. It used to be serious.
Now, despite an authentic reproduc
i tion, it is called burlesque.
Around their tables sipping beer
j were representatives of San Fran
i cisco's and the Peninsula's best-
I known families. The older set out
| numbered the young 'uns six to one.
The play is "executed by the full
j strength of the Company," according
i to the program. When it was our
j pleasure to see it, it was likewise
j executed by the full strength of the
I audience, which entered into the
i spirit of the evening so well that the
: players actually had much difficulty
putting their voices beyond the foot
lights—even with the aid of a loud
speaking system.
Vallejo Gantner, as Squire Cribbs,
! the crooked old "bad influence" who
j drags a beloved husband into the
I gutter, and Peg Converse, the wife
I whose love replaces likker, occupy
I much of the show, with John Car-
J ter, as "Honest William Dowton, her
j brother," coming for his share of
credit.
If you like such lines with proper
| accompanying gesticulations as
"Curse me as your destroyer" and
I "Nay, friend, take not your life but
mend it" and "Where is my dear,
my love, my redeemed one?' and ii
you like to sing all the old songs
over a stein of beer, then you should
1 see this show. —B. L.
