FOUR STARS FOR THREE
CORNERS
The most mis-named production
in Stanford history will breeze
ihrough the breeze-ridden Assem
bly Hall tonight. To call the thing
"Three Cornered Moon" is just one
more example of the madness that
characterizes the whole play. Much
more appropriate would be "The
Nutty Rimplegai's," "Nut House," or
simply "Nuts!"
Combining unequal parts of com
edy, love, and St. Vitus Dance, the
play is one of those dramatic cy
clones needed to revivify campus
theatrics. "Enemy of the People"
lost boxoffice under the stigma of
"highbrowism"; the "Gaieties" were
"lowbrow." "The Nutty Rimple
gars" will tickle the intelligentsia
into uproarious submission, panic
the low-high brows, flatter the high

low brows, and delight the rough
who wants entertainment —raw and
rough.
"Nut House" is not one of .those
things thai strain the imagination.
The author has simply thrown to
gether some of the major and minor
idiocies and idiots—found in some
measure in every home in America
—mixed them up with a bit of pep
per, precipitated off most of the
slow-moving molasses, and called it
s play.
Never v/as a more ridiculous and
real set of characters put into one
story. From the "head of the house"
—the simple-witted, hair-waving
Mrs. Rimplegar—down to the suffi
! ciantly nutty maid Jenny, "Nuts" is
full of the oddities who have made
America America, California Cali
■ fornia, and Palo Alto Palo Alto. It

cannot be over-acted. Things do
not happen that way.
The mad family Rimplegar has
appeal lor everyone: A wild bar
rister who will appeal to everyone
except the Law School; a dreamy
poet (Balzar will play the man who
can't take "Yes" for an answer); a
swimmer; an actor; a dose of lovers.
No one will feel disappointed that
the title of "Three Cornered Moon"
has nothing to do with the story. It
fortunately does not refer to much
of a love triangle; it is simply named
and then forgotten. But the name—
good, bad, or indifferent—interests
no one. "Nuts" hold the stage!
