# CAMPUS OPINION
## ZERO HOUR 
### 
To the Editor, Sir:
Next Monday, the 14th, is the zero
hour for the Stanford Track Team.
Unless hte B.A.C. calls a meeting to
reconsider the team's going East, it
will be too late. To go, the team
must leave Saturday. It the student
members, Wilber and Trautman, re
consider, there is yet a chance. Both
voted against the measure for fear
of a deficit in the budget. New de
velopments have occurred. It is
heard from reliable sources that in
certain items of hte budget, larger
deficits have been predicted than
have actually occurred. The same
"sources" feel that the difference be
tween tho actual and predicted defi
cits will cover expenses of sending
the team East. The Skull and Snakes
Fund will send two men to the meet.
