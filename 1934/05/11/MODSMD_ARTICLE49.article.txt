# CAMPUS OPINION
## ZERO HOUR 
### 
To the Editor, Sir:
Next Monday, the 14th, is the zero
hour for the Stanford Track Team.
Unless hte B.A.C. calls a meeting to
reconsider the team's going East, it
will be too late. To go, the team
must leave Saturday. It the student
members, Wilber and Trautman, re
consider, there is yet a chance. Both
voted against the measure for fear
of a deficit in the budget. New de
velopments have occurred. It is
heard from reliable sources that in
certain items of hte budget, larger
deficits have been predicted than
have actually occurred. The same
"sources" feel that the difference be
tween tho actual and predicted defi
cits will cover expenses of sending
the team East. The Skull and Snakes
Fund will send two men to the meet.
Five more will win it. Alumni rave,
students mutter, but still there is no
action. The track team is actually
losing spirit with five weeks of un
broken training before the N.C.A.A.
Meet. With the greatest chance in
years to win, Stanford's Two-man
Team will be a poor representation
of Stanford's real power. Immediate
action is necessary! The only solu
tion is an immediate open meeting
of the B.A.C. to reconsider the ques
tion under the new favorable condi
tions. With the aid of Wilbur and
Trautman, and perhaps our alumni
friend from the city, all of whom
may be convinced at the meeting
that the budget isn't threatened
after all, the former action may be
reversed. If they do this, then Stan
ford's team of picked men may once
again capture the coveted title. The
B.A.C. must reconsider. The campus
demands it! LET'S GO!
