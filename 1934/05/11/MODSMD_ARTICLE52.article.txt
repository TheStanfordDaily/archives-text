# Chaparral Goes on Sale On Quad This Morning
## 
### 
The Chappie is out today. At. last
the campus may read this highly
touted number for itself.
Judging from the comment of its
editor, Jimmy Algar, this will be a
most entertaining and amusing pic
ture of the Daily, the Illustrated Re
view, and the News. "Nothing but
the worst" will be its motto.
Chappies will be available at 8
o'clock on the Engineering corner
and from salesgirls on the Quad.
