# REVISION OF RALLY COMMITTEE GAINS OPEN FORUM OKEH
## Chairman Beaubaire Urges "Gravy ' Elimination 
### 
Generally accepted as providing a |
great improvement over the exist- j
ing Rally Committee system and j
drawing only a few superficial ob- j
jections, the proposed charter for J
three new organizations to handle |
student activities passed the first i
barrier to final Executive Commit- '
tee approval at a public hearing last j
night.
Stan Beaubaire, present Rally |
Committee chairman and author of j
the new plan, explained the pur
pose of the proposal as being to di- |
vide the work of conducting student
activities between three interested |
and responsible bodies totaling 45 ;
members.
Rally Men Too Few
At present this work is handled 1
by the Rally Committee, which is J
composed of 30 members. Because |
of the large amount of work which !
must be handled by the group, the ;
limited number of members has
proven inadequate to handle it with
the greatest amount of success.
The new charter provides for ten
women and five men to be added to
the groups which will handle the ac- I
tivities in the future.
"Gravy" Cut Out
Elimination of the possibility of
political "gravy" would also be i
brought about by the acceptance of 1
the new charter, according to Beau- !
baire.
With the popular approval of the j
plan displayed at the hearing last
night, the charter has been placed j
before the Constitution Revision i
Committee consisting of Crompton
Bangs, Frank Fullenwider, Elinor,
Kahn, and Donn Tatum. If approved i
by this group it will be presented to
the Executive Committee for inclu- j
sion in the by-laws of the Consti- i
tution.
