# UNIQUE QUARTER-TONE ORGAN USED FOR PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT TESTS
## 
### 
Few Stanford students know that
the University possesses one of the
most unique of musical instruments
—a quarter-tone organ. This rare
instrument registers quarter-tone
intervals, whereas the ordinary key
board of a piano or pipe-organ is
confined to half-steps.
This organ is used by Dr. Paul
Farnsworth of the Stanford Psy
chology Department in conducting
his music appreciation tests, for it
reveals very accurately the "ear"
anyone has for distinguishing fine
graduations in tone.
Warren D. Allen, in an interview
on the possibility of producing com
positions in quarter-tones, stated
that although Europe is experiment
ing somewhat with this new depar
ture in the field of music, little has
been done in the United States.
Mr. Allen stated that when in Eu-«.
rope he had seen an organ in Munich
with as many as 54 keys—twice as
many as the Stanford organ. He cx-

I plained that there is much difference
lof opinion among experts as to
, whether a quarter-tone scale such
, as the Stanford organ has, is or is
1 not superior to the third-tone inter
! val scale.
j Mr. Allen stated that the great
value of organs such as Stanford has,
lies in the fact that oriental music
! can be produced on them, as well as
other music which cannot be faith
fully reproduced on an ordinary
1 half-tone scale. He stated that Henry
Cowell, noted composer, who will be
| at Stanford summer school teach
ing, will deal fully with quarter -
I tone music in one of his courses.
