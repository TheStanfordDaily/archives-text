# RED RIDERS' SUBS FORM POLO FOUR IN TROJAN SERIES
## Reserves Expect Victory Again Tomorrow 
### 
Poloists from Southern California
arrive tonight for a game tomor
row at 2:30 o'clock against the In
dian riders, hoping to avenge the
defeat suffered at the hands of the
Redshirts in Los Angeles during
March.
The chances are that they will re
turn disappointed to their Trojan
stronghold, however, unless they are
a much stronger team than they
were six weeks ago, when the score
read 12 to 8 against them.
Trojans Have Chance
Their chances tomorrow are based
on only two things — the fact that
Captain Richard Gordan is sending
his second team against them, and
that both teams wll be riding mounts
from the local military stables,
whereas in Los Angeles the first
team rode against them on Will
Rogers' horses.
But no one who has watched the
second string men in action these
last lew weeks can say that the
Trojans have much of a chance.
Frank Burns and Bill Enemark
played so well in the Oregon State
games that Captain Gordan had both
of them turn out as substitutes in
last week's game with San Mateo
Country Club.
Cards Powerful
Cal Emeis and Jim Henderson
complete the four who will ride for
Stanford tomorrow. Both of them
are hard - hitting mallet - wielders
themselves and capable of giving
anyone a good battle.
So it looks as though a Stanford
team has been found at last which
should be able to make short work
of the best the Trojans have to offer,
and this a substitute Indian team at
that.
Gordan Builds Team
The responsibility for the wealth
of polo material found on the cam
pus this year is all Captain Goi'dan's.
His work during the last six years
on the campus in training good play
ers and developing polo ponies for
them to ride has resulted in the
present team, which ranks as highly
as any college outfit in the country.
All who have worked with him
have expressed regret that he will
not be here next year, due to the
fact that his army term here has
expired and he will be sent to the
East at the end of the present
quarter.
Tomorrwo's game will begin
promptly at 2:30 o'clock at the High
way Field, and Luppe Luppen and
Ed Boyles. will be referees. No ad
mission will be charged.

have expressed regret that he will
not be here next year, due to the
fact that his army term here has
expired and he will be sent to the
East at the end of the present
quarter.
Tomorrwo's game will begin
promptly at 2:30 o'clock at the High
way Field, and Luppe Luppen and
Ed Boyles. will be referees. No ad
mission will be charged.
Poloists from Southern California
arrive tonight for a game tomor
row at 2:30 o'clock against the In
dian riders, hoping to avenge the
defeat suffered at the hands of the
Redshirts in Los Angeles during
March.
The chances are that they will re
turn disappointed to their Trojan
stronghold, however, unless they are
a much stronger team than they
were six weeks ago, when the score
read 12 to 8 against them.
Trojans Have Chance
Their chances tomorrow are based
on only two things — the fact that
Captain Richard Gordan is sending
his second team against them, and
that both teams wll be riding mounts
from the local military stables,
whereas in Los Angeles the first
team rode against them on Will
Rogers' horses.
But no one who has watched the
second string men in action these
last lew weeks can say that the
Trojans have much of a chance.
Frank Burns and Bill Enemark
played so well in the Oregon State
games that Captain Gordan had both
of them turn out as substitutes in
last week's game with San Mateo
Country Club.
Cards Powerful
Cal Emeis and Jim Henderson
complete the four who will ride for
Stanford tomorrow. Both of them
are hard - hitting mallet - wielders
themselves and capable of giving
anyone a good battle.
So it looks as though a Stanford
team has been found at last which
should be able to make short work
of the best the Trojans have to offer,
and this a substitute Indian team at
that.
Gordan Builds Team
The responsibility for the wealth
of polo material found on the cam
pus this year is all Captain Goi'dan's.
His work during the last six years
on the campus in training good play
ers and developing polo ponies for
them to ride has resulted in the
present team, which ranks as highly
as any college outfit in the country.
All who have worked with him
have expressed regret that he will
not be here next year, due to the
fact that his army term here has
expired and he will be sent to the
East at the end of the present
quarter.
Tomorrwo's game will begin
promptly at 2:30 o'clock at the High
way Field, and Luppe Luppen and
Ed Boyles. will be referees. No ad
