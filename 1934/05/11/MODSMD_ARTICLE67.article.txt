# GRAYSON STARS AS REGULARS SCRIMMAGE SECOND STRING IN BRIEF GRID WORKOUT
## 
### 
Tiny Thornhill's regulars got
rolling yesterday in a brief scrim
mage with the so-called second
string, but long enough to show
some of the old spark reminiscent
of the Big Game last year.
With Bobby Grayson taking the
ball from center at the fullback
post, most of the plays consisted of
passes from the Portland streak to
ends Monk Moscrip and Keith Top
ping and halfback Bones Hamilton.
Second string backs showed a strong
defensive game, however, and the
percentage of passes completed was
not as large as the average.
Grayson more than once faked a
forward and shot off around end to
register substantial gains. It is this
trait of his, and his ability to roll
up yardage usually that makes him
the great threat that he is at the
all-important fullback post. On
straight line plunges he also made
five to ten yards at a crack, an av
erage which would please any coach
in the country.
Moscrip and Topping, playing at
end for Grayson's team, showed that
very few yards will be gained
around the flanks this year. Both
are versatile athletes, and can go
through sixty minutes of hard play
without having to throw in the'
towel. They are a pair of fighters

through and through, and like the
going when it gets rough.
Stari Anderson, playing for the
second string, got off some tremen
dous kicks in practice, most of them
going far beyond those of other
backs. In the course of the scrim
mage, he intercepted one of Gray
son's passes and made a nice run
back, eluding half of the varsity be
fore being brought to earth.
Thornhill's first string lined up
with Topping and Moscrip at ends,
Ed Lettunich and Bob Reynolds at
tackles, Larry Rouble and Woody
Adams at guards and Alf Brandin
at center. Backs were Grayson,
Hamilton, Frank Alustiza, and
Johnny Reisner.
The second string had Harry
Carlson and Carlos Monsalve at
ends, Jack Drown and Louis Tsout
souvas at tackles, Bob Black and oob
O'Connor at guards, and Wes Mul
ler at center. Backs were Joe Vigna
and Chuck Whtie, halfbacks. Chuck
Ledbetter, full, and Stan Anderson,
quarter.
Ledbetter was hitting the line
hard, and getting off some good
passes, and Monsalve on one end,
figured prominently in the play.
Monsalve was once freshman cap
tain, but left school after a Little
varsity squad experience, and may
return to school next year.

mage, he intercepted one of Gray
son's passes and made a nice run
back, eluding half of the varsity be
fore being brought to earth.
Thornhill's first string lined up
with Topping and Moscrip at ends,
Ed Lettunich and Bob Reynolds at
tackles, Larry Rouble and Woody
Adams at guards and Alf Brandin
at center. Backs were Grayson,
Hamilton, Frank Alustiza, and
Johnny Reisner.
The second string had Harry
Carlson and Carlos Monsalve at
ends, Jack Drown and Louis Tsout
souvas at tackles, Bob Black and oob
O'Connor at guards, and Wes Mul
ler at center. Backs were Joe Vigna
and Chuck Whtie, halfbacks. Chuck
Ledbetter, full, and Stan Anderson,
quarter.
Ledbetter was hitting the line
hard, and getting off some good
passes, and Monsalve on one end,
figured prominently in the play.
Monsalve was once freshman cap
tain, but left school after a Little
varsity squad experience, and may
return to school next year.
Tiny Thornhill's regulars got
rolling yesterday in a brief scrim
mage with the so-called second
string, but long enough to show
some of the old spark reminiscent
of the Big Game last year.
With Bobby Grayson taking the
ball from center at the fullback
post, most of the plays consisted of
passes from the Portland streak to
ends Monk Moscrip and Keith Top
ping and halfback Bones Hamilton.
Second string backs showed a strong
defensive game, however, and the
percentage of passes completed was
not as large as the average.
Grayson more than once faked a
forward and shot off around end to
register substantial gains. It is this
trait of his, and his ability to roll
up yardage usually that makes him
the great threat that he is at the
all-important fullback post. On
straight line plunges he also made
five to ten yards at a crack, an av
erage which would please any coach
in the country.
Moscrip and Topping, playing at
end for Grayson's team, showed that
very few yards will be gained
around the flanks this year. Both
are versatile athletes, and can go
through sixty minutes of hard play
without having to throw in the'
towel. They are a pair of fighters

through and through, and like the
going when it gets rough.
Stari Anderson, playing for the
second string, got off some tremen
dous kicks in practice, most of them
going far beyond those of other
backs. In the course of the scrim
mage, he intercepted one of Gray
son's passes and made a nice run
back, eluding half of the varsity be
fore being brought to earth.
