# Cindermen Leave for Fresno West Coast Relays
## TROJAN TEAM FAVORITES TO KEEP VICTORY STRING IN RELAY MEET TOMORROW Lyman, Deacon, Klopstock, Mottram, Blackman Lead Twenty Stanford Cindermen against S.C. 
### 
Coach Dink Teniplcton and a selected group of Stanford track and
field performers depart from the campus tomorrow morning by bus to
participate in the annual Fresno West Coast Relays to be held in the
"Ilaisin City" tomorrow night.
Although Dink has not yet definitely decided upon his complete ros
ter. the Stanford delegation is sure to be representative with such great
stars as John Lyman, Sam Klopstock, John Mottram, A1 Blackman, and
Bud Deacon competing for the Cardinal.

Will S.C. Repeat?
Southern California, the defending
champion", which has won the title
for the past five years is the favorite
to repeat again tomorrow, but Stan
ford, California, Fresno State, and
U.C.L.A. should press them. Dean
Cromwell, the Trojan, track men
tor, is bringing 40 of his best men
north and the Trojans appear to be
a cinch to win at least three of the
several college relays, the four man
quarter-mile, four man half-mile,
and the four man mile, being their
strongest races.
One of the highlights of the re
lays will be the appearance of
Stanford's former captain and great
est middle distance star, Ben East
man, in a special half-mile race.
Ben, who holds the world's marks
in the quarter-mile at 46.6 and the
half mile at 1:50.9 will attempt to
crack the latter mark in tomorrow
night's exhibition. .He will be
pressed by Ralph Walt of San
Francisco University and Ross Bush,
a U.S.C. frosh, who set a world's
interscholastic record of 1:54 for the
distance last year.
Competition for Ben
Elroy Robinson, great Fresno State
middle distance star, who has de
feated Stanford's Nimmo and S.C.'s
Estel Johnson earlier this season,
may also enter to give the Blazer
a little more competition.
Ben has already run a little over
1:52 this year. That was the time
he made in the Stanford-Olympic
Club meet several weeks ago.
Another special feature of the
carnival will be the appearance of
Bullet Bob Kiesel of California,
greatest of all Bear dashmen, in a
special 100-yard dash. Pitted against
him will be S.C.'s flashy sophomore,
Foy Draper, who pushed Bob into a
9.5 hundred in the Cal.-S.C. dual
meet.
Draper a Fasty
Diaper, a tiny mite who pounds
the cinders with tremendous force,
is one of the fastest starters in the
business, and Berkeley Bob will
have to be on his toes if he noses
him out. Willson of Stanford will
also compete in this competition.
Stanford will probably enter a
four-man team of Thorns, Williams,
Willson, and Reppy in the quarter
mile relay and a quartet of Thorns,
Williams, Willson, and A1 Blackman
in the half-mile baton event.
In the mile relay, the Cards will
have Dear, Dellenger, Burris, and
Blackman, the same quartet that set
a new Big Meet record of 3:15:5 this
year. However, the Trojans with
McCarthy, Ablowich, Tompkins and
Fitch are the heavy favorites in this
event and are considered a threat
to the world's record of 3:12.0 held
by Shove, Ben Eastman, and the
Hables brothers, the Stanford quar
tet of 1930.
Sam Faces Lyons
In the open 120-yard high hurdles,
Sam Klopstock, who, some experts
predict, will be the greatest barrier
topper the world has ever seen be
fore he hangs up his spikes, will
run against Bob Lyon of the Tro
jans and a record breaking perform
ance is forecast. Sam has run 14.5
this season and the Trojan defeated
him in 14.7 last Saturday when
Klopstock hit two hurdles and was
unable to regain the lost distance.
Stanford will have Paul Zaches in
the jump, but ho will have
to leap better than ever before to

crash into such stiff competition as
Clark of California and Mc-Fadden
of S.C. will afford, both of these
boys having season's marks of well
over 24 feet.
Lyman at It Again
In the shot put Johnny Lyman
will be out for a new world's mark
and stands a good chance of obtain
ing it if he doesn't press too much.
Stanford's contribution to the dis
cus will probably be Slinger Dunn,
capable of 155 feet on a good day
and probably Lyman, who has tossed
the platter near the 150-foot marker.
Dunn will probably compete in the
shot also. He has put it out over
51 feet this season.
Marty Flies High
In the high jump Stanford may
enter Lloyd Schween, Howie. Ar
thur and Humbert Smith, although
quite naturally Fresno State's great
star, Walter Marty, will win easily
unless he breaks a leg, and has also
announced his intention of trying
for a new world's record to sup
plant the present one of 6 feet 9 1-8
inches, which he now holds.
The javelin will be featured by
the great throwing of Stanford's
John Mottram, who has yet to be
defeated this year. Mottram's sea
son's best is 220 feet 10 1-2 inches
and the Card sensation tosses the
spear over the 210-foot mark on
practically every effort.

boys having season's marks of well
over 24 feet.
Lyman at It Again
In the shot put Johnny Lyman
will be out for a new world's mark
and stands a good chance of obtain
ing it if he doesn't press too much.
Stanford's contribution to the dis
cus will probably be Slinger Dunn,
capable of 155 feet on a good day
and probably Lyman, who has tossed
the platter near the 150-foot marker.
Dunn will probably compete in the
shot also. He has put it out over
51 feet this season.
Marty Flies High
In the high jump Stanford may
enter Lloyd Schween, Howie. Ar
thur and Humbert Smith, although
quite naturally Fresno State's great
star, Walter Marty, will win easily
unless he breaks a leg, and has also
announced his intention of trying
for a new world's record to sup
plant the present one of 6 feet 9 1-8
inches, which he now holds.
The javelin will be featured by
the great throwing of Stanford's
John Mottram, who has yet to be
defeated this year. Mottram's sea
son's best is 220 feet 10 1-2 inches
and the Card sensation tosses the
spear over the 210-foot mark on
practically every effort.
Coach Dink Teniplcton and a selected group of Stanford track and
field performers depart from the campus tomorrow morning by bus to
participate in the annual Fresno West Coast Relays to be held in the
"Ilaisin City" tomorrow night.
Although Dink has not yet definitely decided upon his complete ros
ter. the Stanford delegation is sure to be representative with such great
stars as John Lyman, Sam Klopstock, John Mottram, A1 Blackman, and
Bud Deacon competing for the Cardinal.

Will S.C. Repeat?
Southern California, the defending
champion", which has won the title
for the past five years is the favorite
to repeat again tomorrow, but Stan
ford, California, Fresno State, and
U.C.L.A. should press them. Dean
Cromwell, the Trojan, track men
tor, is bringing 40 of his best men
north and the Trojans appear to be
a cinch to win at least three of the
several college relays, the four man
quarter-mile, four man half-mile,
and the four man mile, being their
strongest races.
One of the highlights of the re
lays will be the appearance of
Stanford's former captain and great
est middle distance star, Ben East
man, in a special half-mile race.
Ben, who holds the world's marks
in the quarter-mile at 46.6 and the
half mile at 1:50.9 will attempt to
crack the latter mark in tomorrow
night's exhibition. .He will be
pressed by Ralph Walt of San
Francisco University and Ross Bush,
a U.S.C. frosh, who set a world's
interscholastic record of 1:54 for the
distance last year.
Competition for Ben
Elroy Robinson, great Fresno State
middle distance star, who has de
feated Stanford's Nimmo and S.C.'s
Estel Johnson earlier this season,
may also enter to give the Blazer
a little more competition.
Ben has already run a little over
1:52 this year. That was the time
he made in the Stanford-Olympic
Club meet several weeks ago.
Another special feature of the
carnival will be the appearance of
Bullet Bob Kiesel of California,
greatest of all Bear dashmen, in a
special 100-yard dash. Pitted against
him will be S.C.'s flashy sophomore,
Foy Draper, who pushed Bob into a
9.5 hundred in the Cal.-S.C. dual
meet.
Draper a Fasty
Diaper, a tiny mite who pounds
the cinders with tremendous force,
is one of the fastest starters in the
business, and Berkeley Bob will
have to be on his toes if he noses
him out. Willson of Stanford will
also compete in this competition.
Stanford will probably enter a
four-man team of Thorns, Williams,
Willson, and Reppy in the quarter
mile relay and a quartet of Thorns,
Williams, Willson, and A1 Blackman
in the half-mile baton event.
In the mile relay, the Cards will
have Dear, Dellenger, Burris, and
Blackman, the same quartet that set
a new Big Meet record of 3:15:5 this
year. However, the Trojans with
McCarthy, Ablowich, Tompkins and
Fitch are the heavy favorites in this
event and are considered a threat
to the world's record of 3:12.0 held
by Shove, Ben Eastman, and the
Hables brothers, the Stanford quar
tet of 1930.
Sam Faces Lyons
In the open 120-yard high hurdles,
Sam Klopstock, who, some experts
predict, will be the greatest barrier
topper the world has ever seen be
fore he hangs up his spikes, will
run against Bob Lyon of the Tro
jans and a record breaking perform
ance is forecast. Sam has run 14.5
this season and the Trojan defeated
him in 14.7 last Saturday when
Klopstock hit two hurdles and was
unable to regain the lost distance.
Stanford will have Paul Zaches in
the jump, but ho will have
to leap better than ever before to

crash into such stiff competition as
Clark of California and Mc-Fadden
of S.C. will afford, both of these
boys having season's marks of well
over 24 feet.

have Dear, Dellenger, Burris, and
Blackman, the same quartet that set
a new Big Meet record of 3:15:5 this
year. However, the Trojans with
McCarthy, Ablowich, Tompkins and
Fitch are the heavy favorites in this
event and are considered a threat
to the world's record of 3:12.0 held
by Shove, Ben Eastman, and the
Hables brothers, the Stanford quar
tet of 1930.
Sam Faces Lyons
In the open 120-yard high hurdles,
Sam Klopstock, who, some experts
predict, will be the greatest barrier
topper the world has ever seen be
fore he hangs up his spikes, will
run against Bob Lyon of the Tro
jans and a record breaking perform
ance is forecast. Sam has run 14.5
this season and the Trojan defeated
him in 14.7 last Saturday when
Klopstock hit two hurdles and was
unable to regain the lost distance.
Stanford will have Paul Zaches in
the jump, but ho will have
to leap better than ever before to

crash into such stiff competition as
Clark of California and Mc-Fadden
of S.C. will afford, both of these
boys having season's marks of well
over 24 feet.
Lyman at It Again
In the shot put Johnny Lyman
will be out for a new world's mark
and stands a good chance of obtain
ing it if he doesn't press too much.
Stanford's contribution to the dis
cus will probably be Slinger Dunn,
capable of 155 feet on a good day
and probably Lyman, who has tossed
the platter near the 150-foot marker.
Dunn will probably compete in the
shot also. He has put it out over
51 feet this season.
Marty Flies High
In the high jump Stanford may
enter Lloyd Schween, Howie. Ar
thur and Humbert Smith, although
quite naturally Fresno State's great
star, Walter Marty, will win easily
unless he breaks a leg, and has also
announced his intention of trying
for a new world's record to sup
plant the present one of 6 feet 9 1-8
inches, which he now holds.
The javelin will be featured by
the great throwing of Stanford's
John Mottram, who has yet to be
defeated this year. Mottram's sea
son's best is 220 feet 10 1-2 inches
and the Card sensation tosses the
spear over the 210-foot mark on
practically every effort.
Coach Dink Teniplcton and a selected group of Stanford track and
field performers depart from the campus tomorrow morning by bus to
participate in the annual Fresno West Coast Relays to be held in the
"Ilaisin City" tomorrow night.
Although Dink has not yet definitely decided upon his complete ros
ter. the Stanford delegation is sure to be representative with such great
stars as John Lyman, Sam Klopstock, John Mottram, A1 Blackman, and
Bud Deacon competing for the Cardinal.

Will S.C. Repeat?
Southern California, the defending
champion", which has won the title
for the past five years is the favorite
to repeat again tomorrow, but Stan
ford, California, Fresno State, and
U.C.L.A. should press them. Dean
Cromwell, the Trojan, track men
tor, is bringing 40 of his best men
north and the Trojans appear to be
a cinch to win at least three of the
several college relays, the four man
quarter-mile, four man half-mile,
and the four man mile, being their
strongest races.
One of the highlights of the re
lays will be the appearance of
Stanford's former captain and great
est middle distance star, Ben East
man, in a special half-mile race.
Ben, who holds the world's marks
in the quarter-mile at 46.6 and the
half mile at 1:50.9 will attempt to
crack the latter mark in tomorrow
night's exhibition. .He will be
pressed by Ralph Walt of San
Francisco University and Ross Bush,
a U.S.C. frosh, who set a world's
interscholastic record of 1:54 for the
distance last year.
Competition for Ben
Elroy Robinson, great Fresno State
middle distance star, who has de
feated Stanford's Nimmo and S.C.'s
Estel Johnson earlier this season,
may also enter to give the Blazer
a little more competition.
Ben has already run a little over
1:52 this year. That was the time
he made in the Stanford-Olympic
Club meet several weeks ago.
Another special feature of the
carnival will be the appearance of
Bullet Bob Kiesel of California,
greatest of all Bear dashmen, in a
special 100-yard dash. Pitted against
him will be S.C.'s flashy sophomore,
Foy Draper, who pushed Bob into a
9.5 hundred in the Cal.-S.C. dual
meet.
Draper a Fasty
Diaper, a tiny mite who pounds
the cinders with tremendous force,
is one of the fastest starters in the
business, and Berkeley Bob will
have to be on his toes if he noses
him out. Willson of Stanford will
also compete in this competition.
Stanford will probably enter a
four-man team of Thorns, Williams,
Willson, and Reppy in the quarter
mile relay and a quartet of Thorns,
Williams, Willson, and A1 Blackman
in the half-mile baton event.
In the mile relay, the Cards will
have Dear, Dellenger, Burris, and
