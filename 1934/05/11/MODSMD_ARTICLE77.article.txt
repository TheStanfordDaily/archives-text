### 
COUNTRY'S BEST
MEET MERE

It isn't often, outside o»' football
and track, that a college team can
lay claim to being one of the coun
try's be.st, but Stanford's water polo
squad can do just that. At the pres
ent writing the L.A.A.C. team, the
same line-up which represented
America in the O'ympic Games two
years ago, really has the best claim
to the distinction, but all that may
be changed this week-end when the
teams meet in a three-game series.
Last spring the Mercury men
nosed the Cardinals out in a couple
of close games, but with a year's
lidded experience, Nbrt Thornton's
squad should be able to push the
clubmen even harder. Austin Clapp,
Stanford graduate student, is about
the only member of the-1932 Olym
pic team that is not with the L.A.
A.C. squad now.

JAVELIN THROWER'S
BUGABOO AGAIN

Thai old bugaboo Ihul haunts the
dreams oi every javelin thrower, a
bad shoulder, jumped up and stared
Johnny Mottram in the lace the
other night. After taking a couple
of practice throws. Mottram felt a
pain shoot down his arm from the
.should. !- so he immediately laid off
for a couple of days.
Apparently, however, the pain was
a false alarm as he seems tis good as
ever now and if he really is, he
.should set up a new mark down at
Fresno tomorrow. The men in tha
field events get three qualifying
trials in the afternoon and the hot
weather down at Fresno should be
ideal for new records.
It looks very possible also that
Stanford's mile relay world record
of 3:12.6, once thought unapproach
able, set up by Maynor Shove, Abe
and Ike Hables, and Ben Eastman
will be cracked at Fresno tomor
row. Without the necessity ol sav
ing Ed Ablowicb for the low hur
dles. S.C. can put its strongest team
on the track and go after the record.

FOUR GREAT
QUARTER-MILERS

U.S.C. has the greatest quartet of
quarter-milers in the country. Tak
ing their best times during the sea- |
son, McCarthy, <!0.9; Tompkins, 47.5; i
and Fitch, 47.9. all from a running
start and adding the 48.2 which Ab- 1
lowich is easily capable of from a |
standing start despite the fact that
he has concentrated on the hurdles
1 his year, we find that if the Tro
jan team comes up to its best it can i
run 3:10.2, just two and .4 seconds
faster than Stanford's mark which
they said would never be broken.
In addition to the Trojan team
there is the U.C.L.A. quartet which ;
broke the long-standing Drake re
lays record a few weeks ago an
chored by Jimmy LuValle atid the
Stanford four, holders of the new
Big Meet record.
The mile relay and javelin marks
aren't the only ones that are threat
ened either, with John Lyman in the
shot, Sam Klopstock and Bob Lyon,
U.S.C., in the high hurdles, Bob I
Kiesel, California, in the century, !
and Bud Deacon in the pole vault, i
