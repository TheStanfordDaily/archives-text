# Damaging Dust Storms Boost Wheat Market
## 
### 
CHICAGO, May 10 (/P).â€”Several
states in the Midwest were plunged
into semidarkness today when heavy
clouds carrying thousands of tons of
dust rose up from the parched wheat
fields. Much damage was done by
plagues of cinch bugs, grasshop
pers, and other insects.
The airplane schedules were dis
rupted, as Chicago sky-scrapers be
came hazy, grotesque shapes to ob
servers a block away, and the dust
seeped through the windows of of
fices and homes, covering desks and
papers and undoing the spring house
cleaning of a million housewives.
Accompanying the news of the in
creasingly severe damage to the
crops inflicted by the prolonged
drought and raging dust storms,
wheat prices soared inside the Chi
cago pit. Fields parched by days of
unabated heat and lack of moisture
in wheat growing areas, particularly
in the Northwest, were reflected on
the Chicago Board of Trade and
other leading markets by spectacu
lar increases in the price of grains.
The excited, speculative buying
rushed the price to within 10 cents
of the farmer's old-time ideal, $1.00
a bushel.
