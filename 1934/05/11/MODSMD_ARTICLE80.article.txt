Piling up a total of six goals, the
seniors yesterday afternoon re
mained in the inter-class soccer race
by defeating the sophomores in a
one-sided contest, with only seven
men per team.
Playing under a blistering sun,

' neither team played good ball until
the second half when the seniors
broke loose with a rally that netted
them five points. Captain Carl
Knecht scored the first goal late in
the firrl half. In the second, Sven
| Doddington drove home three, while
John Moore and A1 Navarro each
I added one.
Next week the second half of the
I series gets under way when the
freshmen meet the juniors on Mon
day in what promises to be the
crucial game in the battle for the
J winner's plaque.
