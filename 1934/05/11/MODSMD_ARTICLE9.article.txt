WASHINGTON, May 10 (JP). â€”
Walter S. Gifford, president of the
American Telephone & Telegraph
Company, today told the House

telephone business is now, in our

He opposed the administration bill
to create a federal communications
commission.
"There has been no evidence," he
said, "that any change is necessary."
