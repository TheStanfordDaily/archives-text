# Claim French Parliament Must Change or Vanish
## 
### 
PARIS, May 10 (yP).—The French
Parliament, said by its own members
to be at the cross roads, will next
week begin a struggle in which its
life and form will be a major issue.
"It must change or disappear—it
is at the crossroads," said a resolu
tion of the Deputies who pushed
through the appointment of a com
mission to revise the constitution,
overhaul the government, and
strengthen the President's powers.
Mobs that sought to sack the
Chamber February 6 convinced
members they must alter iheir ways
"or something will happen."
Charges of Fascist leanings are
heard on many sides. Many public
men deny they wish to overthrow
the Republic but they demand a bet
ter Republic.
