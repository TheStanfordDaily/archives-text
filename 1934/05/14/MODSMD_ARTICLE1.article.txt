"I'm a good boy, y' clam') eha,"
stormed Marvie Kahn, chan in of
almost everything on the iampus,
late last night between four blondes,
and four beers. Kahn distinguished
himself, it will be remembered as
intramural manager by letting his
eating club, El Horo carry away the j
university honors. 'And," he con- ]
tinued, "I know which side my bed
is buttered on."
Competent observers have re
frained from any comment although,
it is reported that George Bliss Cul
vert, dean of many, has officially
sanctioned any acts that the little
fellow may perpetrate.
"I think he'll be a hell of a good j
proxy," screamed Culvert, late last !
night, "and by gods, I'll think I'll j
make him ... a sponsor. In fact I j
think I'll appoint all of El Horo to ,
sponsors jobs and then at least we'll
know where they do their drinking,"
he continued.
When approached by the press, j
Kahn mustered his best English and j
whipped out potent answers.
"I guess that guy Mottram is the
man for youse," he said. "He's got
all the rooster fish on the campus be
hind him. I wouldn't be in his place
for nothing.
"Dis elections's only secondary
wit' me," he ejaculated, "the really,
truly important thing is the Junior
stomp of which I am the chairman i
which is to be this Friday. Vote for j
Kahn and I'll take you out Friday." j
Just then Mottrain staggered in i
the open door. "I'll be damned if I
know why I'm in this race," he said, |
"but I can throw the javelin pretty
good. I don't know why I'm run
ning"
"That's all right," said Kahn,"'
"don't worry. It's no worse than a |
bad cold."
Kahn has a hell of a fine record: i
He built the biggest bonfire when he
was a frosh; he's been on the best j
dance committees; he's been on the j
best rally committee and just the
other day he served the finest fly- i
blown meal ever seen at the Conva- |
lescent Home. El Horo can well be I
proud of Kahn as can the Brother- (
hood of Turtles. Both organizations j
are backing Kahn to the hilt. What i
greater love?

He built the biggest bonfire when he
was a frosh; he's been on the best j
dance committees; he's been on the j
best rally committee and just the
other day he served the finest fly- i
blown meal ever seen at the Conva- |
lescent Home. El Horo can well be I
proud of Kahn as can the Brother- (
hood of Turtles. Both organizations j
are backing Kahn to the hilt. What i
greater love?
"I'm a good boy, y' clam') eha,"
stormed Marvie Kahn, chan in of
almost everything on the iampus,
late last night between four blondes,
and four beers. Kahn distinguished
himself, it will be remembered as
intramural manager by letting his
eating club, El Horo carry away the j
university honors. 'And," he con- ]
tinued, "I know which side my bed
is buttered on."
Competent observers have re
frained from any comment although,
it is reported that George Bliss Cul
vert, dean of many, has officially
sanctioned any acts that the little
fellow may perpetrate.
"I think he'll be a hell of a good j
proxy," screamed Culvert, late last !
night, "and by gods, I'll think I'll j
make him ... a sponsor. In fact I j
think I'll appoint all of El Horo to ,
sponsors jobs and then at least we'll
know where they do their drinking,"
he continued.
When approached by the press, j
Kahn mustered his best English and j
whipped out potent answers.
"I guess that guy Mottram is the
man for youse," he said. "He's got
all the rooster fish on the campus be
hind him. I wouldn't be in his place
for nothing.
"Dis elections's only secondary
wit' me," he ejaculated, "the really,
truly important thing is the Junior
stomp of which I am the chairman i
which is to be this Friday. Vote for j
Kahn and I'll take you out Friday." j
Just then Mottrain staggered in i
the open door. "I'll be damned if I
know why I'm in this race," he said, |
"but I can throw the javelin pretty
good. I don't know why I'm run
ning"
"That's all right," said Kahn,"'
"don't worry. It's no worse than a |
bad cold."
Kahn has a hell of a fine record: i
