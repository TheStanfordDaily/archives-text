# Hoover's Recent Trip Not Political; My, No
## 
### 
Herbert Hoovsr, most famous
alumnus of Stanford University, re
turned to the campus today after a
wide-swung tour through the South
and Middle West.
He refused to comment on the po
litical significance of his trip, indi
cating that his secretary, Paul Sex
son, would issue all statements.
"Mr. Hoover merely enjoyed a se
ries of social visits with his old
political friends and grafters," Sex
son declared. "He just wanted to
sound out the boys as to how they
were going to stack up in the 193G
campaign."
