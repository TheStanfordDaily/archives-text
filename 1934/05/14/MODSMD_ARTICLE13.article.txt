# Another Lousy Bunch Of Grut Literature
## 
### 
The Stanford Yearbook of Writing
will appear on the campus next
week featuring the work of Oscar
Itch, in a short epic of a girl of the
streets called "Purple Grut." The
whole book is practically the filthiest
thing ever conceived, and would do
according to Dr. Margery Baily, for
excellent carpet padding.
Price has been marked down to
$1.99, and 97 copies are expected to
be sold to guys who had rejected
manuscripts. They all, it is said,
want to see what kind of crapule
will have to be written in order to
get accepted.
