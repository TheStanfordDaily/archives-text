suckers, or we'll make it plenty
tough for you," declared Henry
Heavybags, chairman in charge, last
night.
"We want this $25,000 extraction to
go over big," Heavybags continued,
"because there's lots of things that
can be done around here. Yeah, I
can do a lot of things with that 25
grand. I haven't decided yet just
what, but it's a worthy appeal."
Mumms the Word!
As an added inducement five cases
of champagne will be given away to
five lucky purchasers of the tickets.
"If the Benefit of the Benefit for the
Benefit Charity goes over with a
bang Stanford University may get
five inches of publicity in the San
Francisco papers. The good name of
the University is paramount!" says
Dr. Wilbur and Mrs. Carol Green
Wilson.
Following this festivity, the work
ers will enjoy a barbecue of the
horse donated by the BA.C.
