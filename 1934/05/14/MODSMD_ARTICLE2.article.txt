# TRAUTMAN FAVORS WOMEN EVERY TIME
## 
### 
"No more gravy for the Rally j
Committee" is the slogan flaunted ,
over the new charter providing three j
new organizations to promote the ;
hey-hey spirit on the Farm.
There is only one trouble with i
the new charter and that is that the j
Ex committee isn't given a hold on j
the throats of the would-be high
dc-hoers.
"It's a good idea," sanctioned Jerry !
Trautman, "but we'll have to draw
up a plan practically in contradic- :
tion to the new one so all the policies j
of the executive committee can be |
practiced after its inclusion in the
by-laws."
"This idea to put 10 more women i
into activities administrations a good i
idea too," continued the prexy. j
"More women running things will j
make it easier for me to manage j
things."

Congrats, Ex. Committee
