## 
### 
Rotarian Almond Ezra Roth, in
terviewed yesterday noon upon his
return from business (Rotary busi
ness) in Mexico, reported a great
world upturn in Rotary spirit.
Asked about recent developments
in the matter of n new theatre for
Stanford, Roth looked for some 15 or
20 minutes, then brightened:
"Ah, yes," he said, "theatres, but
you know the Mexicans prefer bull
fights. And you know Rotarians par
ticularly enjoy bull lights. And have
I told you about that snake—"
"Yes, you have," interrupted his
interviewer. "By the way, what do
you think the chances are of send
ing the track team East?"
"East, East, ah yes," murmured
Rotarian's ex-president. "I think 1

! shall be able to work another trip
East out of this Rotary outfit before |
I'm through. A great organization, ;
Rotary International. I'm leaving for
Tucson tonight, you know."
Trying once more, the interviewer
asked how the present financial con
dition of Stanford stood. At these
words Roth's face brightened.
"Stanford, finance, that reminds
me," he said, "there has been some- 1
thing on my mind for the last six !
months and you have reminded me I
what it is. I must take a few min
utes and run down to the office to
see how dear old Stanford is getting
along."
As lie grabbed his hat and hurried
out his voice floated back—"Stan- ;
ford—finance—such a burden."
