# Oust Tongs As Millard Cheers Win
## Ends Bitter Battle To Help Mary Yost 
### 
( Tears and cheers deluged the
| Stanford campus today following an
j official proclamation from the office
I of Dean Mary Yost that sororities
must go.
Reports from her cheerful little
stooges indicated that Greek living
groups were ali the bad things the
Dean had instructed they be found
to be.
Overjoyed at the success of a long
and bitter campaign, Jeanne Mil
lard, president of the Associated
Students, set up reporters to beer
before giving out an exclusive inter
view to the Stanford Daily, the Palo
Alto Times, the Chronicle, Examiner,
the News, Call-Bulletin, and her
| home-town sheet, the San Bruno
Blatter.
"Of course, the Dean and I belong
to the same tong, but when we think
j sororities make pure little girls into
i two-faced hypocrites and we would
not stand for that. No siree," em
phatically declared Miss Millard.
! "Sororities make good girls unhappy
j and unhappy girlsâ€”well, let's not
j talk about such unpleasant things."
Jane Hillebrand, recently trans
ferred to this cozy little Farm from
! Swarthmore College, where ever the
i hell that is, said, "well, I kicked in
with Millard because I figured I
could go farther that way than if I
sank into oblivion in the I).G. house.
Besides I don't like the kind of roses
they grow in front of the D.G.
house."
A petition being circulated among
| the several hundred row women in
dicated that next year the sorority
i chapters would move en masse to
! U.C.LA. Some 200 male students
j are reported to be in favor of going
i along.

Congrats, Ex. Committee
