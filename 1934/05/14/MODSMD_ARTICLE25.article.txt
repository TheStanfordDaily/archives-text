# THOUSANDS CHEER AS EX COMMITTEE THROWS IN SPONGE
## TRAUTMAN'S MOB TAKES IT ON LAM; ADMITS BUTCHES 
### 
Amid the resounding cheers of thousands, the Executive Committee to
day bowed down to the Will of the People and walked itself around the
block.
For the first time in the memory of political veterans, the sage group
appeared dejected and humiliated. Widely-known as the Brain Trust of

tthe Stanford student body, the* com
mittee surprised even its staunchest
supporters in admitting a long series
of atrocious hutches. Its members
appeared to have cracked under the
strain of official business.
Worn out by his checkered career
as Master of Ceremonies at the
l Greatest Sideshow on Earth. Presi
: dent Gerald "Grandmother"' Traut
nian could only smile weakly as he
left his sumptuous office in the Old
Union.
"My, I'm going io miss all the tele
j phones and buzzers and the plush
| bottomed easy chairs," he exclaimed.
[ As the deposed monarch left the
Seat of the Mighty he carried in his
hand a telegram from Bill Corbus,
past high mogul. It contained this
cryptic message: <: I think it's a good
! idea. I'm for it."
"All I can say is that the feelings of
myself and my fellow committee
members are terribly hurt," Traut
man said. "Here we've been run
ning student government as it has
never been run before, and what do
we get?"
"A TREMENDOUS KICK IN THE
; PANTS," came the raucous echo
from the multitude assembled out
side the executive offices.
A tear dropped from Trautman's
I eye as he fondled the little blue
| ribboned gavel that would mean so
much to him in years to come. "Ger-
I aid H. Trautman, President, Asso
ciated Students of Stanford Univer-
J sity, 1933-34," it was engraved.
Miss Jeanne Millard followed the
president down the greased incline.
Draped around her neck was a huge
floral horseshoe of erabapple blos
soms. Inscribed on the floral arc was
the slogan, "Meddle and Muddle for
Me."
Rumors as to why the committee
walked out flew like wildfire. One
j report indicated that the Executive
Committee was ashamed of itself for
its incompetency. Another was
that the constitution did not give it
I the power it thought it deserved.
Another was that several members
desired to gun for the Daily editor
ship. Another was that the Daily
editorship was gunning for them.
The only fact that seemed to stand
1 out above t|ie wild rumors was an
agreement 1 that the committee
walked out in a huff. Or perhaps it
was a minute and a huff.
In an official statement issued
through the office of Dr. Ray Lyman
I Wilbur, the committee made itself
quite clear. The statement follows:
"We, the undersigned political po
i tentates, in order to form a less pcr
i feet Union, insure justice and lib
erty, have decided to quit cluttering
up the local scene and step out into
the realm of fish peddling where we
rightfully belong."'
"A magnificent gesture," declared
' Dr. Wilbur. "I'd do the same my
self. if I didn't have this job so sewed
up that nobody can do much about
. it."
A new feeling of student harmony
was evident on the Farm following
! the governmental upheaval.
Miss Stevens and Miss Aten, right
ful heirs to the throne, looked up
from the respective business only
long enough to mutter, "This is so
seldom!" They appeared mildly sur
prised, but only modestly concerned
when informed that student govern
ment has been put back into their
dutiful hands.
