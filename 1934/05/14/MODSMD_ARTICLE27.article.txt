						Good Five-Cent Donation

Of course the Daily wouldn't come right out and say so
for anything in the world, but if actually pressed on the
point it might intimate that it thinks Dr. Wilbur is a swell
medico, lie's jus! the bestest oT "boy's best friend" you
could ever hope to find.
Hut what this country needs is a good five-cent cigar.
And what this I 'Diversity needs is a good five cents. And
what the president of this institution needs is a smooth
line, a big grin, and a knack for inveigling dying alumni
into granting huge and sundry sums to their dear old Alma
Mater. Phooie! Stanford hasn't had a really whole
hearted, out-and-out, glad-hand donation since Herb Hoo
ver was a little lad.
You can't tell a dog bv his bark and a bird in the hand
bus a silver lining, or something like Hint, but the good
ol' bulldog Daily will chew to the line and let the quips
fall where they may.
The Daily claims this university needs more dough
heavy old grads and a president who can wheedle 'em into
land-granting a new Quad and a couple of stadiums and
a band-picked football or track team when necessary.
