Of course the Daily wouldn't come right out and say so

Hut what this country needs is a good five-cent cigar.
And what this I 'Diversity needs is a good five cents. And
what the president of this institution needs is a smooth

hearted, out-and-out, glad-hand donation since Herb Hoo
ver was a little lad.
You can't tell a dog bv his bark and a bird in the hand
