Abraham Lincoln coined himself a pretty kellle of
Avoids when he took out his jack-knife and whittled out:
"You can fool some of the people some of the time and
you can el cetera some of the people all of the time hut
von can't el cetera all the people et cetera the time."
The Daily thinks "Honest Abe" must have been think
ing of the Stanford Convalescent Home when he carved
out them homely woids of wisdom.
Charity begins at home, say some. Charity BELONGS
;i! home, says the Daily.
Feed the shortcake to the kiddies! Enough of this pock
et book chiseling, Ibis fake horn-looting, this synthetic en
thusiasm that takes a whole month of misguided effort and
raises only enough dough to set up the kiddies for a couple
of days.
The Daily figures the populace is getting a little tired
of King Contests, Brunches, Carnivals, penny - grabbing
campaigns and kindred sorts of impositions on the Golden
Heart of the Stanford Rough.
"Chisel your pocketbook, Mister?" Swell slogan.
"Feed the shortcake to the kiddies!" Retort courteous.
