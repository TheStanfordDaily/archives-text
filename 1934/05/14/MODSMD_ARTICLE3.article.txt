"Sure I'll be President," offered J
1 Johnny Mottram, Phi Psi, last night i
with his sly, boyish, Elm-Cottage I
smile. "What do you think I called •
that Phi Psi caucus for?"
Speaking from the top of Phi Psi |
castle, on Phi Psi knoll, overlooking '
"Big Hughie" Miller's window and |
the Pi Phi sleeping porch, Mottram
grinned again as he answered que
ries concerning his first actions as j
, head of the new central-centralized j
Ex Committee.
"Platform?" he demanded. ''I don't J
even need one. But I'll sure show I
'em a thing or two new about hand- I
,ing the job of A.S.S.U. Phew. Pros- j
ident. Hell, I mean why—golly, I'll
throw the jave—I mean, I'll throw ;
the whole Ex Committee 220 feet '
down to the Law Steps if they don't
do what I tell 'em to." lie grinned
again, and winked carefully in the j
direction of Elm Cottage.
Asked why he wanted to run to
morrow, he looked rather dubious j
and immediately began thumbing j
Spalding's Sports Guide to find out |
where the track meet was. "You've j
got me all wrong," he snickered. "I (
throw the javelin, but I don't run."
His interviewers bore up well and
reminded him that the Phi Psi caucus j
has asked the campus to elect him j
President tomorrow. "My name is |
not Throttlebottom," he said. "Call
me Finn."
"Why am I running? Why, I guess, i
I mean, that is, well "He looked j
around a minute and saw Gentleman I
Jerry Trautman waving franticalTy j
from his post at the helm of the S.S. I
We Tell-em Ex Committoe. "Oh. j
yeah. I'm on the Ex Committee. Isn't i
that enough? It's really a lot of fun, !
the way everybody likes to talk to I
you before Trautman calls for a vote, j
Everybody simj ly loves to make
you think that he's right, and by i
golly, I most always can't tell how I
to vote. The fellows have a lot of '
fun trying to talk to me last, and j
then I just don't know what to do, j
because the last argument always |
sounds so good. Gosh, but it will be
fun to be President and be able to
run things."
He paused and heaved a javelin j
down to the Pi Phi sleeping porch, i
where it cut the hind legs of! a flj 1
on President Gibner's bed. She !
looked aghast.
"Before I forget," he continued, "I
want to thank the campus for its i
overwhelming support tomorrow. I
certainly appreciate it. In fact, I'm
going to hold regular office hours
next fail before each Ex Committee j
meeting so all my supporters can
tell me what they want to be. Boy, |
I'll do anything!"
