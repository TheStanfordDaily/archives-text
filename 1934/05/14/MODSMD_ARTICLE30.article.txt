Loud was the clamor when good old I'ncle Adminis
tration tacked a dollar onto the tuition to help pay for
the Stanford Pavilion. That was long ago.
(ientlemen of the "old school" entered these portals
for the paltry sum of $09. That was long ago.
People who screamed about (he new and outrageous
sil l tuition finally subsided. That was long ago.
The Pavilion was built and paid for. That was long
ago. Hut we still pay that dollar - -?
(luottrs: "Oh, THAT was gone long ago!"
