# WHY IT'S NEWS
## 
### 
Insull, whose name you have no
doubt seen in the pages of the met
ropolitan press has been taking up
quite a bit of space in the papers
lately, and doubtless you have been
wondering what the hell the rumpus
was all about. Well gather around,
kiddies, while I give you the benefit
of my experience on the Yale News.
It seems that Insull had a few com
panies in the East somewhere and
when the Depression came along,
why they all went broke and so ln
j.ull left the country and ever since
the government has been trying to
net him back. Although they have
had quite a bit of trouble, they now
have Mr. Insull just about where
lhoy want him and I'll bet they teach
him a thing or two .... or three.

Dillinger is a notorious bandit who
has also made the front pages re
cently. His name is news because
people are interested to know that
banks are still open and can be
robbed. Dillinger is news because
he has brought a new influence into
the American scene. It has long
been the tradition that banks could
only be robbed by their directors,
but along came Dillinger and now
there is hell to pay.
Fire
The Chicago fire was news and
still is because of the tremendous
damage that it caused. People are

| still talking about that fire, by gum.
i There have been many other fires in
this country which is one reason that
we have firemen. Firemen are not
news. They are usually pretty good
guys, although not very bright. I
knew a fire man once in Detroit, but
■ that's another story.
F.D.R.—N.G.?
F.D.R. and Mrs. F.D.R. occupy the
While house because they are the
President and his wife. I don't think
that this is news because n great
1 many people already know about it.
i If I were the only one who knew, I
! could make a pretty penny by sell
. ing the story to somebody because
' news is a commodity just like oakum
1 or saurkraut juice.
