# BULL SESSION
## DRINK A CURSE?

What can ever be the matter with
American students? Do they
not have any insides? Can it be
that they lack moral fibre and the
spark of genius? I for one can not
answer these questions. But that
doesn't make them bad questions.
No!
In Europe and even in the Orient,
students get out in the streets and
battle like all hell for Communism,
Fascism, Masochism or whatever
they happen to be interested in at
the time. Do the American students
do the same? The American student
is interested in nothing enough to
fight about his principles. The Amer
ican student has no principles. Some
eminent scholiasts have even sug
gested that the American student is
a cretin.
Yes!
Oh, Oh, Oh, American student
Whither we are drifting. Must we
irrevocably slither down the v/aya
into complete ennui. (I'M a dreamer,
ennui all) or shall we mount the
White Horse (say Charger at Roos
Bros.) and gallop, tlot, Hot, forward,
ever onward toward a new Utopia
where all students get out into the
street and battle like all hell for
Communism, Fascism, or Masochism
or whatever they happen to be in
terested in at the time. Why, oh why
must so much of our time be taken
up with the purely physical?
It is now Spring on the campus
and our thoughts turn to love and
not being able to vent our passions
or anything around, we'll have to go
hunting abroad.
