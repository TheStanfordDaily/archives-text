'"Well, I don't think I could pull
many more boots on the Ex Com
mittee than I've pulled on my feet,"
declared Bill Rogers, after trans
ferring to Stanford this year so that
he could develop himself politically.
"Of course," he continued, '"my
opponent, Jess Ray. has been on the
campus longer than I have, but that's
beside the point. I don't know any
thing around here, and any batches
that I'd pull would be purely in fun
â€”you know, just like the Ex Com
mittee pulls 'em now."
Ray couldn't be reached last night
to make any statements. He was in
hibernation studying the new con
stitution in a vain effort to figure it
all out, it was reported.
