# THE

## THREE-CORNERED MOON 
### 
Well, sir, my sorority sister, a Phi
Gamma Kappa, had the lead in this
here production and I sat right in
the front row with all the Phi Gam
ma Kappa's and we thought it was
just the duckiest little performance
that Haroldy Helvenston has ever
let the Phi Gamma Kappa's put on.
Of course I had the Daily passes
which made the show just that much
more enjoyable for me. It was a
gosh-awful good performance. (If
say just the nice right things about
just the nice-right people, I may get
to be women's editor of the Daily
someday.) I repeat it was a gosh
awful good performance.
Didja notice Gertie Guesswork
there in that ducky little white crea
tion that she must have got half-oil'
at a clearance sale. Georgous dress,
Gertie.
But I must get back to the show.
It was thrilling. I counted up seven
teen, "Hell's," eleven "Damn's," and
several well-uttered "My God's."
