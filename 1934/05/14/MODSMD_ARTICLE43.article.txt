# CAMPUS OPINION
## 19 AND PRETTY 
### 
Dear Mr. Editor Mans:
I don't know whether or not you
will listen to little me or not but I
have a few words to say. I feel that
I should let you know who I am. I
am 19 yrs. of age and my friends
say that I am pretty, but you know
how fellows talk.
Now about these sororities. We
think that they should go, me and a
couple of other "girls" on the "cam
pus." Couldn't we get together for a
long, long talk sometime? Just you
and I, Mr. Editor?
