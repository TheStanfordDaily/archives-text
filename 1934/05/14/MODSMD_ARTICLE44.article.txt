The Editor, Sir:
1 have just came to this school
from Swillmore, a very ritzy college
in the East and I think I should give
you a few pointers. There were only
three girls regularly enrolled at
Swillmore and so there were only
seven sororities. So me and a couple
of other "girls" turned in our pins
and led a revolt against the "Greeks."
I certainly think that Sororities
should go, Mr. Editor, and I am sure
that you agree. Of course you
haven't turned in your D.G. pin but
if you had one, I am sure you would.
Yours in the faith,
Jane Feelgrande
