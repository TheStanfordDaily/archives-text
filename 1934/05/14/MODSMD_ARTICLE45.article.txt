# STINKY DAVIS!
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Of course some folks think I'm a 1
Stinky Davis, but when I yet over |
my point here, I'm sure you'll agree
I'm God's gift to Stanford. I guess ;

| I'm not president of the A.W.S. for
nuthin' huh, Mr. Editor?
Just between you and me, Mr.
Editor, we think sororities should go,
don't we? It's too bad you couldn't
have been kicked out of the Theta
i house (or maybe you have) —any-
way if you had, it would be much
easier for you to see my point of
! view.
Some of the gals think that just
! because they made me president I
j ought to stay in the sisterhood, but
■ the heck with them. I figure if I
! want to raise cane I can be as big a
! stink as anybody. Ha, ha.
