CARDS A CINCII
AT TROYVILLE
We never toot our own horn but
having ben 100 per cent wrong with
all previous prognostications we feel
all pulled up over our success as a
forecaster of great events and ex
ceptionally well qualified to predict
a tremendous Cardinal landslide
when that stalwart band of Indian
braves goes forth to do battle with
the helmeted Trojan of Troyville.
Starting with the mile, Minno is a
cinch to take first for the farmer lads
trailed by his teammates, Flounder
and Pollywog. A sweep for the In
dians. A lot depends on the 100-yard
dash so we think Troyville won't
score a point. Nine more for the sons
of the Cardinal.
Things are looking bad for the
Ironworkers with the Midget Marvel
slated for first in both hurdle races
followed by Our Captain, a surprise
entry, in second, and Kingman Hunt
ingberry third.
TROJANS FAIL
TO SCORE AGAIN
Poor Troy. The one-lap duel is a
hard one to dope but since the Farm
lads have had more lap experience
than Ihe boys from Troyville, de
spite their Cinema City advantage,
we pick the Cardinals one, two, three
again. i
Two laps and eight laps should be j
just as easy for the Indians to han- I
die. Let it never be said that an ;
Indian quailed at the sight of a lap, I
so we find the Cardinals rolling up
the points again. The relay should
be easy. One lap for each man.
With Johnny Myman heaving the
mass of iron and steel, Troyville j
doesn't even hope to break into the |
weights. The Zete quartet is nothing i
but a trio this year with two of the
members singing out of tune most of |
Ihe time, but the Trojans can't sing
at all so that makes 18 points for the |
Cause.
TROY RALLIES;
CREEPS UP ON INDIANS
lint now comes the sad news. The
Trojans will make a determined bid
for victory in the next two events i
because the Farm only has two
broadjumpers. One point for Troy.
The final score: 06 to G5.
