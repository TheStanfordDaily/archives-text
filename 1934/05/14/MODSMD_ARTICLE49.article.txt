# B.A.C. Raves at Track Disclosures
## YEASTMAN RECORD PROVES DUD; WHO STOLE 25 YARDS? "Am I Boined?" Questions Aged Boy Coach 
### Malarkey Brittlechin 
Offices of the Stanford B.A.C.
were thrown into the most confusion
yesterday since the Norgard disr
closure as a sudden scandal con
cerning their best turnstile attraction
in a decade was made known.
"Hell," declared Dinky Trumpem
down, veteran Boy Coach, "how did
I know the Angell Field track was
25 yards short of a quarter mile?
Ben Yeastman always impressed me
as being a good runner."
"It can't be true," commented Al
vin Gasters, "Ben Yeastman IS the
record holder."
Disclosure of the discrepancy in
the alleged quarter-mile track was
made when investigators from the
University of Southern California
and Lawson Robertson of Pennsyl
vania announced the results of a
two-weeks' sleuthing excursion.
Carrying on their operations in
the dark of night with the aid of a
two-bit flashlight and a picce of
wrapping string, they discovered
that the track over which Yeastman
set his supposed world record in 1932
was a full 25 yards short.
"Heck, I knew it all the time," said
the Los Angeles county surveyor,
flicking a hunk of horsemeat from
between his teeth. "That feller
Yeastman waren't so hot."
Gasters indicated that an investi
gation of the investigation would
begin immediately. "They can't get
away with this," he asserted. "Why,
it's ridiculous!"
Don Liebendorfervitch suggested
the possibility that ragamuffin stu
dents from the University of Cali
fornia stole the length of track to
fill out their short furlong stretch.
"By the Blue Grut," he stated, "their
track was 20 yards short last year
and now it's regulation length."
Question: Did prowler of U.C.
filch the 25 yards in retaliation for
Les Hables reported steal of the
Campanile to plug up the holes in
his budget; or is it a plot of Holly
wood to insure the ICAAAA for The
Trojans?
