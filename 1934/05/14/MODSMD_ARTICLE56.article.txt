Branner Club presents its annual
big brawl June 1.
Bids will not be lower than ever
before. In fact they will be as high
as ever, $2. The motif is not original,
the decorations will be as lousy as at
most other Stanford dances, and one
of the two usual dance bands will
furnish music.
Punch will also be plentiful as
usual.

President Wilbur has worn out
forty-four pairs of trousers sitting at
the bedside of dying alumni.

The world's supply of moth balls
