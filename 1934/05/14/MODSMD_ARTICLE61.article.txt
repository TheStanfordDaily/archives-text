# GRID STAR GROG MONEY LACKING
## 
### 
Agitated grid stars stormed the gates of the B.A.C. offices last December j
in a last minute attempt to soften the heart of the money bag moguls, it was !
revealed today by a player who didn't get a contract for next season. Only j
$25 v/as allowed each player for the ten days of the trip to the Rose Bowl ;
game and the gridders figured that this was not enough.

Although hotel and board bills'
were paid, the players figured that
they couldn't buy enough grog to last
for three days with the paltry sum
tossed to them by gold hungry man
agers. A few dire threats were made
and finally the B.A.C. capitulated to
the extent of granting the players
four extra tickets so that they could
bring lots and lots of their friends to
the game.
Unfortunately, a slight mist settled
down on the sunny Southland and
the tickets sales at the agencies
slackened perceptibly. A lot of the
lads went so far as to give their
tickets away in exchange for stag
dinners.
One lad, brighter than the rest,
with an I.Q. of 70 or thereabouts
finally received a phone call request
ing some tickets and the buyer, who
gave no name said that he would call j
at the desk of the hotel just before j
the game for the ducats. Swell.
After the game, he rushed back to
the desk and breathlessly asked the
clerk if anyone had called for the
tickets.
"Yeh, a dame come and gottem,'
said that worthy.
"Where's the five bucks?"
"Aw, she didn't leave no dough."
said the clerk. "She said for you to
look her up and she'd pay in the
usual way."
Thinking to save money in the
long run, it is rumored that the
player spent the rest of his dough
trying to locate the pretty one's fa- ;
vors.
