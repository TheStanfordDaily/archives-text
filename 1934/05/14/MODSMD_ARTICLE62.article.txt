## 
### 
Row and Hall men, club men, and
various political factions on the cam
pus, marching en masse in the larg
est demonstration seen on the Farm
for centuries, well anyway weeks,
descended on Dean Culver in the
quiet of his little business sanctum
last night each group demanding
that at least one of the "brothers" be
appointed a sponsor to watch over
the destinies of little freshmen next
year and, just incidentally, get in a
little dirty rushing.
"Gosh, fellers," Culver quavered,
"ya know there aren't more'n just
so many sponsor vacancies, and gee,
we try to distribute them evenly,
but, gosh, you know how it is. Why,
I've even got all the dope worked
out on charts here, all the statistics,
n' everything. Of course statistics
can be twisted around to prove any
thing you want to, but gee, we
couldn't fool you. It takes special
qualifications you know, and gee,
can we help it if one group gets all
the guys that have those qualifica
tions?"
Dr. Wilbur, who just happened to
drop in at that time, interrupted,
"Now look here George. You're not
doing this right. Heck, I wanta ap
point the sponsors."
"Now listen, Ray," Culver shot
back, "I've got this whole thing
doped out mathematically. I'm just
tryin' to help you out."
"Oh, all right, if that's the way
you feel about it," Wilbur remarked
as he took out his handkerchief to
wipe away his tears of disappoint
ment.
