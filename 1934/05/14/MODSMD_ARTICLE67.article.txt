The Editor, Sir:
Isn't it grand, Mr. Editor, the way
one defenseless little female like me
can put the entire 800 on its collec
tive ear? Who would have thought
it!
I like to be a hell-raiser. Sorori
ties MUST go! 'Course I want my
engagement announced up at the
Theta house and 1 think all the sis
ters are just dears, but I can't let a
little sentiment tarnish my reputa
tion. One of us has got to go, Mr.
Editor, and I sort of figure the so
rorities might as well be it.
