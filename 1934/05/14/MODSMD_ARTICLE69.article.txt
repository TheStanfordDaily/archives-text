# Can New Eagle Out-Withel Turtle Gang?
## 
### 
Making a claim to superiority over
Stanford's long established Turtles,
the Eagles have founded a chapter
on the Farm with the purpose of
flying over Turtles imitating sea
gulls.
Leader of the Eagle forces is Chief
Beagle-High Lyman, eminent A.S.
S.U. vice prexy.
The new Eagle members have long
been jealous of the high social stand
ing of Turtles in social circles. Hav
ing inferiority complexes the Eagles
claim they are better than the Tur
tles, because eagles fly and turtles
crawl
Turtles refuse to give recognition
to the new organization claiming
that all Eagles arc in reality only
Roosterfish.
