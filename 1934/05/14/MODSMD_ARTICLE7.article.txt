# Campus Dicks Are Kidnaped; Farm Is Agog
## Two Flatfeet Have Been Missing Entire Week; Frehe on Search Trautman Seeks Additional Power for Ex Members 
### 
Gordy Davis and George Burns,
campus officers of the law, have been
missing for a week.
This was made known late last
night by Mrs. Carol Green Wilson,
distributor of campus goings on, by
special permission of Fred Frehe,
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, Miss Mary
Yost, George B. Culver, and the San
Francisco Call-Bulletia.
"I'll run down those kidnapers if
it takes years and years," Frehe said,
"and it probably will."
Wilbur Seeks Publicity
Dr. Wilbur is reported to have
withheld his sanction to making the
kidnaping known until there was a
shortage of headline news for San
Francisco papers. "We must keep up
that record of a headline a week for
Stanford in the Call-Bulletin," Dr.
Wilbur roared.
Deans Yost and Culver endorsed
the publishing of the startling kid
nap plot simultaneously, with a note
to Mrs. Wilson, Stanford's famous
censoress.
The note read as follows:
"We have decided that the students
should know what is going on around
the Farm as soon as it happens. The
students should know that Gordon
Davis and George Burns are missing.
We urge the students to co-operate
with the officials who are handling
the case. We hope no one is caught.
It might cost the University a few
checks."
Trautman Plenty Burned
The release received from the
Call-Bulletin by Mrs. Wilson stated
that a first-class page one sensa
lional make-up has been developed
for the story during the week and
that the campus can print the mate
rial just as long as the Call-Bulletin
gets it first.
Jerry Trautman, commenting on
the disappearance said: "This would
not have happened if the Executive
Committee had power to appoint and
fire the campus sleuths. We would
have fired them the night they were
kidnaped."

Congrats, Ex. Committee
