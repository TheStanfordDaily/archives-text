# BARKEEP TALKS OF POLITICS AND BEER

j "I've seen politicians come and
go," says Rube Blub, head bar tender
i at the Union, "and I want to tell you
boys, they're all a nuisance, just like
I ants in your pants."
i The veteran philosopher was wax
i ing fat and flexing his right biceps
i supple from years of raising beer
| steins. "And when I see a campaign
j for more brains in student govern
ment it makes me laugh."
"Why, where would we be now if
| it wasn't for the past administration
of Grandma Trautman, that peerless
| third baseman and political
i thinker?"
"And the year before of course
' you remember dear old Bill Corbus,
| the smart money player of the year
I before. Why what could we have
done without Bill?"
"Yessir, I say vote for 220 feet
Muttram, the pole vaultcr. Or is it
handball player? These new radical
tendencies are downright danger
! ous."
