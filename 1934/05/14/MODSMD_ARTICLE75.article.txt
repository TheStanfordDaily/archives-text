# STUDENTS CHANGE MINDS ABOUT BEER IN CELLAR DUMP
## 
### 
Meeting in executive session yes- j
terday afternoon, campus leaders
who had favored the Beer in the
Union proposal executed a complete ,
reversal by going on record against
the plan. Their reasons:
1. The beer would probably sell :
for seven (7c) cents.
2. It would be sold in coffee cups
or broken glasses.
3. And would be lukewarm.
4. Length of time required for i
service would cause beer to go flat, i
5. There never would be any bock. !
At the same time, the students pul
forth the suggestion that after con- ]
struction of the $15,000 sun porch j
for sun bathing is finished some pro
vision should be made for a moon j
porch, if of course the $25,000 sink
ing fund has been sunk sufficiently
by then, and if all the bills that
haven't been paid yet after all these j
year are finally paid off, and if noth
ing else comes up.
