# Sex, Rum,-- Stomp Friday
## 
### 
Only a small, very limited, exclu
sive number of pretty invitations to
the Junior Stomp this Friday night
are left, according to Stanford's Mar
vie Kahn, chairman of this stupen
dous, colossal, supreme, magnificent
affair.
They are numbered, Kahn re
vealed (1 to 500). For the first time
in history, they will be available at
the lowest price ever to be an
nounced for any dance this week.
(There will be no other dances this
week). Kahn added that decorations
will be unusual, novel, original,
something never seen elsewhere be
fore. "In fact," he admitted, "you'll
never see anything like it again."
Bids are being sold, for a change,
in the A.S.S. Phew offices in Ye Oldc
Union, where Queen Tevens and Miss
Satan are glad to bull with you at
any time of the day.
The orchestra, Kahn said (you
know Kahn), will hit a new high this
year. The big catch comes with the
announcement that Bernie Makc
shure's little devils arc going to play
from the balcony in Doctor Dyment's
world-famous personal Dance Stu
dio.
"There's more room now to dance
r>n the floor," Kahn decided. "We
may even let Bertha's Great Dane
in for a couple of waltzes. Who
knows?"

Congrats, Ex. Committee
