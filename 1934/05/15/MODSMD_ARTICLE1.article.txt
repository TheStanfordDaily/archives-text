Subject to the approval of the
Faculty Athletic Committee, the
Stanford Board of Athletic Control
last night rescinded a previous ac
tion and decided to send a team of
seven Cardinal track men to the
IC4A meet in Philadelphia May 25
and 26.
The seven men chosen were Sam
Klopstock, John Lyman, John Mott
ram, A1 Blackmail, Slinger Dunn,
Chuck Nimmo, and Bud Deacon.
This list was recommended by Coach
Dink Templeton.
The Board Vote
The nine Board merftbers voted as
follows:
Yes: Students—Jerry Trautman
and Chuck White; alumni, Richard
W. Barrett, Frank L. Guerena, and
Wes Howell.
No: Student — Ray Wilbur, Jr.;
faculty, Dr. T. A. Storey, Dr. J. P.
Mitchell, and Professor William B.
Owens.
The Board vote is subject to
proval of the Faculty Athletic Com
mittee, however. The committee is
composed of five members, three
being faculty B.A.C. representatives.
The other two committee members
are Dr. Eliot G. Mears and Professor
Joseph C. Hinsey.
Faculty Must Vote
The B.A.C. decision will be in
valid, then, if the thi*ee faculty rep
resentatives vote as they did last
night. The faculty committee will
try to meet and settle the matter
today, according to Dr. Storey.
The team of seven will leave for
Philadelphia this week-end if the
faculty committee approves the ac
tion.
