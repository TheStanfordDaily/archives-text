stressed the fact that the dance is
not limited to juniors. Tickets are
still available at the A.S.S.U. office
for only $3 a couple.
The bid sale is really limited, Kahn
specifically stated last night. Not
wishing to be responsible for those
who put off getting their bids until
it is too late, he pointed out that
the dance studio will accommodate
only a certain number of couples
comfortably and ao more will be ad
mitted.
Program Here Soon
The attractive programs for the
Prom are not in yet but will be
given out at the end of the week.
Made of shining black patent leather
with a pounded silver lining, the
dances are listed on imported French
paper inside.
The Junior Prom, famed for its
fine orchestras in the past, with
Bunny Burson last year and Holly
wood's Hal Grayson the year before,
boasts Ernie Heckscher's 15-piece
this year. Furnishing music of the
"last dance" variety from 9 until 1
o'clock, Heckscher will preside in a
specially constructed pit in the bal
cony, leaving the dancers plenty of
room below.
Special Entertainment
The intermission numbers will be
unusually effective from their van
tage point above. Entertainment will
be furnished by Ernie Heckscher
himself with his special guitar solos,
as well as by a trio of Stanford girls,
Philura Graham, Margot Lcland, and
Frances Terrell.
Junior Prom attenders upon en
tering the famed dance studio of the
Women's Gym, will suddenly find
themselves in a glorified pent house.
The panorama of a city entirely sur
rounding the pent house will be
cleverly set off by artistic lighting
effects arranged by Herb Sanderson
and Milo Tally. Having worked on
them the whole of this quarter, Herb
Sanderson is able to promise won
derful results.
Marvie Kahn, chairman of the
Junior Prom, has called a meeting
of the dance committee for 2 o'clock
this afternoon in the Toyon reading
room. He urges that all committee
members be present.
