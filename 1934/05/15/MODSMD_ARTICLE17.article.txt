# CLOSE VOTE SEEN IN KAHN-MOTTRAM PRESIDENT CONTEST
## Five More Declinations Are Made; Ben Cave Withdraws CANDIDATES LISTED Only One Elective Position Not Contested 
### Irvin Jorgensen 
The resignation Friday morning of
Ed Littlefield, James Ludlam, Bud
Sophian, and John Slusser from the
race for Junior Class President, and
of Louise Howell from the Sopho
more Class Secretary-treasurer con
test found political lines being drawn
closer for today's A.S.S.U. election.
With interest focused on the fight
between Johnny Mottram and Mar
vie Kahn for president, both Row
and Hall political leaders said they
expected a very close fight. Claim
ing both the Hall and Row caucus
were non-partisan, the two groups
tried to deemphasize any Hall-R6w
cleavage in the election. On the sur
face, at least, everything is calm, and
a close vote is expected.

Joe Chamberlin, chairman of the
election board, announces that the
polls will be today from 8:30
until 2 o'clock at the usual Law Step
location.
The board will meet in Room 214
after the close of the election to
count ballots. Chamberlin an
nounces: "Candidates may each send
one representative to be in attend
ance when the votes are counted;
the representatives must bear a
written authorization signed by the
respective candidates."
