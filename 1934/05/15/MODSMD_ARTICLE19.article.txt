# Voters Get Instructions In Balloting
## Many Choices Made Void From Mistakes 
### 
% According to Election Chairman
Joe Chamberlin: '"Approximately 8
per cent of all ballots in every elec
tion are void because of failure to
heed instructions at top of ballot."
Although voters will not get into
trouble if they follow the instruc
tions on the ballot, Chamberlin is
sues the following cautions:
1. ALL BALLOTS MUST BE
MARKED IN INK.
2. AN "X" IS THE ONLY REC
OGNIZED MARK WHICH MAY BE
PLACED AFTER A CANDIDATE'S
NAME.
3. THE VOTER MUST MAKE
THE NUMBER OF CHOICES IN
DICATED AT THE TOP OF THE
BALLOT.
