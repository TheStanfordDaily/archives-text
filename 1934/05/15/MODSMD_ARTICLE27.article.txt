# Popularity or Ability?

### 
As a matter of fact, student badv government gives the
participants only a faint smell of what they will lace when
they leave school to enter business. Rut even faint smells
sometimes are obnoxious.
Today students have a chance to name their leaders for
the coming year. Candidates of all descriptions are run
ning for a wide variety of oltices. Some of the offices are
purely honorary; others require ability and training.
If the voters will take the trouble to weigh candidates'
qualifications, they will be able to live in a much more
congenial atmosphere for the next three quarters. Is popu
larity a test of ability to head a governmental setup, or are
there other factors? Make up your mind before voting.
