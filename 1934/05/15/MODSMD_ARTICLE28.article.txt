The Hoard of Athletic Control placed itself in a much
nicer position with a lot of alumni and students last night
when it reconsidered its action of January and of two
weeks ago and decided to send a track and field team to
the Intercollcgiates at Philadelphia.
Part of the blame for the H.A.C. taking its previous
stand was the fault of others, who were interested in send
ing more men East than were needed. As soon as the par
lies got together, it was possible to get some action.
Other governments, both on and off campus, likewise
might do well to heed the requests of the electorate once
in a while.
