The Hoard of Athletic Control placed itself in a much
nicer position with a lot of alumni and students last night
when it reconsidered its action of January and of two

ing more men East than were needed. As soon as the par
lies got together, it was possible to get some action.
Other governments, both on and off campus, likewise
might do well to heed the requests of the electorate once
in a while.
