# WHY IT'S NEWS
## Needed — More of F.R.s Executive Ability 
### CROMPTON BANCS Jr 
Over the week-end things reached |
n new low—for this year. This does j
not mean that business has gotten
much worse overnight. It simply ;
means that the country's morale is
poor. This Is mainly because many j
people fear that the New Deal is :
lacing a severe crisis.
The trouble is that in approaching :
this crisis, F.R. is not asserting his j
leadership as he has in the past. In- j
stead he is dickering very carefully
with Congress—with an eye to the
coming elections.
It is an old American custom for
business to have the jitters when
ever Congress is on the loose. Just '
now the President is still holding the ;
veins; the trouble is that pessimists
think his hold is slipping. Thus the '
worry and apprehension over the j
future.
THE PRESIDENT
MUST CHOOSE—NOW
The time has come for F.R. to take
a stand on the many Issues ap- I
proaching a crisis. If this is impos- j
sible, he should talk to the country !
over the radio. A quiet, friendly
chat with the people would give
business a big boost, and help every
body's confidence a lot.
After a month or so of relative
calm, things are again moving to
ward a crisis. The war debts are
back again—bigger than ever. The
Johnson Ad to ding defaulting na

tions on U.S. stock markets has
brought the whole question to a
head. This time, something will have
to be done.
Of course, in order to do anything
about war debts, the President may
have to get Congress out of Wash
ington. This may fce why he is wear
ing carpet slippers and treading
lightly.
THE OLD ISSUE
TOO MUCH GOVERNMENT
One reason why business is fidgety
is the old boogeyman of Government
control of industry and the stock
market. The Senate passed an ex
change control bill with teeth. The
teeth may never be used, but busi
ness is afraid they will be.
Even if these powers of regula
tion are not going to be used, it
amounts to the same thing if busi
ness thinks they will and acts ac
cordingly. When business men are
nervous about the future, they are
likely to lay off men and stop spend
ing money.
When this happens, recovery will
be held back —just when it seemed
to be really started on its way. This
Is something everybody wants to
avoid.
By taking the leadership firmly
and clearly in stating exactly where
he stands, President Roosevelt can
keep recovery going and avoid an
other slump. hope for a radio
talk.
