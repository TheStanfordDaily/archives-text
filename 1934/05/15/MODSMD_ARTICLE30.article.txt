TII REE -CORNERED MOON
(Tonkonogy)
Assembly liall, May 11
There seem to have been as many
opinions as there were spectators in
the case of this Tonkonogy opus, but
almost all appear to be agreed that
it was good entertainment and that
it featured one of the most intelli
gent casts assembled by Harold Hel
venston in a long time.
The play is not too well con
structed, in that a great deal of si
multaneous actjon is required which
leaves hall' the players simply stand
ing about, and much of the comedy
seems forced. Dealing with the de
lightfully mad Rimplegars, whose
fortunes were ruined through the
brainlessness of ihe mother of the
family, the play is an almost anoma
lous mixture of good genre comedy
and madcap farce.
Helvenston's direction was calcu
lated almost entirely to bring out the
latter quality, and to this end there
was much too much of what can
only be termed horseplay. This
physical type of comedy was substi
tuted for a rapid tempo, noticeably
lacking in the first act, which would
have given the piecc greater smooth
ness and just as many legitimate
laughs.
This directorial overemphasis was
especially manifest in the handling
of the role* of Mrs. Rimplegar, who
was made an incredible caricature.
Notwithstanding the fact that she
had an extremely difficult role for
an amateur and that she was ham
pered by immature make-up, Jean
Albertxon did a good job. She played
Mrs. Rimplegar to the hilt, winning
every laugh and maintaining a con
sistent characterization.
Shelley Smith's Elizabeth was a
fine and straightforward piece of
work, and her splendid second act
curtain was the highlight of the per
formance. Uniformly excellent in
her more emotional scenes, Miss
Smith's work might have benefited
by a lighter touch at other times.
As Kenneth, James Benet turned
in his best performance to date and
the best-timed job in the play. His
pantomime and comedy were nicely
handled, particularly the bar-exam
scene of Act 111.
Robert Balzer's performance as the
novelist was likewise featured by
good pantomime, through which he
earned many genuine laughs. Bal
zer's building of some of his scenes
was notable.
Aside from his "I'm hungry"
scene, which was insufficiently mo
tivated, Joe ChamberlAin was excel
lent as Ed and won a good share of
sympathy. Neal Berry as the other
brother was equally good in a smal-
Jer part, turning in some good com
edy in the final sequence.
The role of Dr. Stevens is a pretty
insipid and thankless one, and it is
to Pete Peck's credit that the char
acter was made interesting and con
vincing.
In smaller comedy parts, Harriette
Hall—with some clever business,
and Kay Arthur—as a maid—were
effective.
As for the setting, it was just too
bad. The only possible excuse for
such bad taste—that the Rimplegars
were that way—doesn't excuse Fri
day night's monstrosity. —Chapin
