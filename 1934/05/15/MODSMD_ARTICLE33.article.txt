# BULL SESSION
## TRAGEDY ON THE PENINSULA 
### 
Two automobiles crashed on the
highway. A girl lay bleeding. Ap
proximately a half hour later an
ambulance arrived. No doctor was
in the machine of mercy. The single
attendant gave emergency aid of the
crudest sort. The girl, a Stanford
woman, may live.
The body of Peter Jewett was
found dead. There was a newspaper
flurry; murder was one of the possi
bilities. Approximately two weeks
later a coroner's jury began its in
vestigation. The verdict called for
further investigation, stated that
death by violence was suspected.
The jury's work had been delayed
while Dr. Proescher (pride of the
Lamson prosecution) returned from
Southern California.
It is a matter of luck that Virginia
Marvin did not die—waiting for that
ambulance to arrive. It is very likely
that if there is a murderer in the
Jewett case, he has had ample time
to escape the law, while doctors,
lawyers, policemen waited for Dr.
Proescher to return from Southern
California.
If it is true that law-breaking col
lege youth is wild, it is equally true
that law-enforcing officialdom is
dead. And, with a broader interpre
tation of the term, officialdom is also
wild CRAZY. Wild and dead offi
cialdom may hesitate a moment be
fore condemning "wild college
youth."
A monstrous myth has grown up
around college students. They, along
with Dillinger, are the popular sym
bols of law violation. Puritans have
seen one-half of the sin of the world
contained in bottles, and the other
half contained in college men and
women. The newspapers have co
operated splendidly to incorporate
sinning youth and sinful liquor.

| But a large measure of youthful
j lawbretiking is due to the fact that
"law-enforcement" has never been
j more than a very feeble farce. Laws
are not made by legislative enact
ment, but by actual enforcement. As
far as custom is concerned, laws
that are not enforced are not laws,
j In attempting to fix the blame for
j lawlessness and wildness, a greater
1 blame rests on incompetent officials
| than on "wild college youth."
i Students are out to enjoy life; with
; but few exceptions they accomplish
j their purpose. Officials are supposed
! to be out to enforce laws; with but
i few exceptions they do not accom
j pllsh their purpose. The major trag
| edy on the Peninsula is not the wild-
I ness of collegians, but the ineptitudr
] and inefficiency of those charged
1 with enforcement of the law.

It is a matter of luck that Virginia
Marvin did not die—waiting for that
ambulance to arrive. It is very likely
that if there is a murderer in the
Jewett case, he has had ample time
to escape the law, while doctors,
lawyers, policemen waited for Dr.
Proescher to return from Southern
California.
If it is true that law-breaking col
lege youth is wild, it is equally true
that law-enforcing officialdom is
dead. And, with a broader interpre
tation of the term, officialdom is also
wild CRAZY. Wild and dead offi
cialdom may hesitate a moment be
fore condemning "wild college
youth."
A monstrous myth has grown up
around college students. They, along
with Dillinger, are the popular sym
bols of law violation. Puritans have
seen one-half of the sin of the world
contained in bottles, and the other
half contained in college men and
women. The newspapers have co
operated splendidly to incorporate
sinning youth and sinful liquor.

j lawbretiking is due to the fact that
"law-enforcement" has never been
j more than a very feeble farce. Laws
are not made by legislative enact

that are not enforced are not laws,

Two automobiles crashed on the
highway. A girl lay bleeding. Ap
proximately a half hour later an
ambulance arrived. No doctor was
in the machine of mercy. The single
attendant gave emergency aid of the
crudest sort. The girl, a Stanford
woman, may live.
The body of Peter Jewett was
found dead. There was a newspaper
flurry; murder was one of the possi
bilities. Approximately two weeks
later a coroner's jury began its in
vestigation. The verdict called for
further investigation, stated that
death by violence was suspected.
The jury's work had been delayed
while Dr. Proescher (pride of the
Lamson prosecution) returned from
Southern California.
