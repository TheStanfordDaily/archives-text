## OBJECTS TO "SCABS" 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Scab, like spit, is a horrid word.
Today, two Stanford students are
scabs. Others are planning to join
them.
Yesterday, several Stanford fra
ternity houses were phoned. Un
yielding employers, desperate for
suckers and seeking scabs for the
Longshoremen's strike, appealed to
college men to whom a juicy dollar
is greater than justice or studies.
Unable to recruit scabs from the
ranks of San Francisco's unemployed
(who won't double-cross their fel
low workers even for 85 cents an
hour) the employers made a roman
tic and enticing appeal to unsuspect
ing students.
The longshoremen, ill and hungry
from rotten working conditions and
low wages, and disgusted with two
faced employers who raise the blull
of mediation but refuse to mediate,
have finally decided to uphold their
rights by strike. Six to eight dollars
a week and 36 hours straight drudg
ing work in the dock's dankness
have made them desperate.
To the workers, it is a bread-and
butter struggle. To Stanford stu
dents now in San Francisco, it is a
lark.
Four days ago, 36 Cal football men
signed as scabs. Yesterday, failing to
find the promised "romance" but
scared to quit, they appealed to the
strikers to allow them to leave. For
four nights they had been cooped up
in an old freighter in the bay; unable
to leave for fear of broken heads,
gradually becoming less willing to
say.
Humane stevedores, swallowing
their disdain for the ignorance of
highly educated college men, allowed
the students to vacate their freighter
and return to the ranks of the civi
lized — a disillusioned group of
youngsters.
Sincerely yours,
Spencer Thompson, '35
