# L.A. Water Poloists Outclass Stanford
## SOUTHERNERS WIN FROM INDIANS TO TAKE COAST TITLE Phil Daubenspeck Stars In Three-Game Series 
### 
After bubbling a chance at the
Pacific Coast title last week-end,
Stanford water polo players will do
their future swimming this year for
the purpose of keeping cool.
Stanford relaxed in guarding often
enough to allow a middle-aged gen
tleman by the name of' Phil Dauben
speck to sink 14 goals as his Los
Angeles Athletic Club blasted Car
dinal hopes for a Coast champion
ship in three straight victories Fri
day and Saturday.
L.A. Wins all Three
Los Angeles won the first, G to 1,
came back to overcome a 2-0 Indian
lead and clinch the title, 5 to 2, in
the second, topped off the series with
a smashing 8 to 3 win Saturday
night.
Daubenspeck scored three times
in the first titlt, four in the second,
and made seven of the eight Mer
cury points in the final contest. He
scored enough points by himself
each game to beat Stanford.
Wally Wiget, who was guarding
Daubenspeck, smothered the ace Los
Angeles all-American consistently,
but he relaxed his vigil just often
enough to permit the southern star
to grasp the ball.
Cook Guards Well
Leo Cook did his bit defensively,
but Daubenspeck proved too much
for the captain-elect. Cook made
several saves bordering on the sen
sational.
Offensively, however, Stanford
looked ragged in all three games.
The passing was consistently poor,
and the Indians seemed to Ijave dif
ficulty holding the ball long enough
to shoot at a well-guarded Los An
geles goal. Vlad Taranik scored foui
goals to lead the Card offense.
Stanford started fairly well in the
first game, and the visitors led by a
2-1 score at halftime. In the second
period, howevex-, Indian guarding
went sour and Lor. Angeles scored
four more successive points.
Lead in Second Game
Stanford gathered her only lea'd of
the series in the second till as Tara
nik and Jack Murietta slipped the
ball past Goalie Herby Wildman for
a 2-0 halttime lead. The second half
was the same story as that of the
first game.
Daubenspeck was four goals ahead
before Stanford entered the scoring
column in the final fray Saturday
evening.
A1 Kallunki, Lakeside coach, ref
ereed all three games.
