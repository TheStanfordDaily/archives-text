The Trojan one-mile relay team, that many sports critics thought capable of world record achievements, lost
to U.C.L.A. at the Fresno relays Saturday when Jimmy LuValle, great little Negro sprinter, broke the tape 10
yards ahead of McCarthy of U.S.C. Left to right the Trojan runners are: Fitch, Tompkins, Ahlowitch, and Mc-
Carthy. (Associated Press Photo)
