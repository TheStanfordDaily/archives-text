IT WAS
SPRING
The cause of the neat round holes
in the new swimming suits was
thoroughly investigated by Dr. Dy
ment and assistants, but though the
laundress was repeatedly hauled on
the carpet, the washing machine ex
amined, and the boxes in which the
suits were carried carefully looked
ovei\ the solution seemed to lie be
yond the proverbial stone wall.
Then one sunny day while the
suits were drying on the line, they
were caught in the act, that is, the
birds who peeked such beautiful
holes out of the new suits.
When told about it, Tony, the
gardener, said nonchalantly, "Well,
what can you expect in the spring?"
