feating U.S.C. riders Saturday by I
the decisive score of 11 to 5.
All four Indian riders turned in |
their best performances of the year '

not only one, but two complete teams !
capable of meeting almost any polo !
outfit on the Coast.
Goals scored in each of the six pe- j
riods were very evenly divided, be- j
tween the four, with Cal Emeis,
Frank Burns, and Jim Henderson
accounting for three apiece and Bill ;
Enemark adding two more.

scoring three out of their five goals.

j for the other two.
