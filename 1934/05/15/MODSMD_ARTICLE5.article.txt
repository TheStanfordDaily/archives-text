# Will Examine Hoover Plans
## Abe Mellinkoff To Preside At Tomorrow's Forum 
### 
Forumites, meeting at 7:15 o'clock
tomorrow evening, will debate on
whether or not "This House favors
the return of Herbert Hoover to the
White House in 1936." Students and
outsiders are free to attend, and may
join in heckling if they desire. The
Forum will be held in Room 203,
English Building.
With former Daily Editor Abe
Mellinkoff presiding, two major
speakers are slated. Frank Fullen
wider, staunch individualist, will
speak in favor of a renewal of the
Hoover regime, opposed by Bill Rog
ers, who is pro-Democrat and favors
a free economic system.
Policy Stressed
Ten minutes will be allotted to
each of the two forensic experts;
during this period they will be open
to heckling from the floor.
Fullenwider stresses the l'eturn of
Hoover to the White House from the
viewpoint of policy, not personality.
He will base his conclusion on the
Hoover platform, arguing that the
Republican program is more effec
tive than that of the Democrats.
Rogers is a proponent of economic
individualism, advocating freedom of
opportunity.
Discussions Slated
Following the major talks, discus
sion will be open from the floor, with
a five-minute limit for harangues.
Mat Evans, Communist; Rolph Mal
locli, pacifist, and Crompton Bangs,
Jr., conservative, are definitely
slated to date, while members of the
audience may also participate.
At the conclusion of the argument,
McllinkofT will submit the question
to a vote of students present.
