# Boggs Speaks Before Board Of Economists
## 
### 
Dr. Theodore H. Boggs, of the
Stanford Economics Department,
spoke on "Suggested Changes in Our
Commercial Policy," before Frank
lin D. Roosevelt's newly created
Commission of Inquiry on National
Policy in International Economic Re
lations. Thus was during its recent
regional hearing in San Francisco at
the St. Francis Hotel.
This commission is visiting cer
tain strategic'economic centers of
the United States, of which San
Francisco was the only place of in
quiry on the Pacific Coast. At the
San Francisco meeting prominent
Western business leaders were sum
moned before the commission, as
well as a few economic experts of
whom Stanford supplied two: Dr.
George William Dowrie, of the
Graduate School of Business, and Dr.
Boggs.
Dr. Boggs commenced his address
by a plea for a program "by which
a breach may be made in the vicious
circle of strangling and retaliatory
restrictions on international trade."
He thon analyzed the economic sit
ution in which the United States
finds itself today. He pointed out
why frhe United States may not for
some time to come continue to sell
abroad as it has in the past, unless
we are able to finance such sales in
some degree. He traced the vital re
lationship between American capital
exported for investment and foreign
trade.
"With the advent of national plan
ning," Dr. Boggs concluded, "it
would appear logical that interna
tional trade should also be made a !
part of the controlled and planned
economy."
