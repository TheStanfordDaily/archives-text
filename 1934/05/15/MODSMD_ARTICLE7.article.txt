TUCSON, Ariz., May 14 (A*).—
June Robles was found alive, but
quite ill, under a heap of cactus
about nine and a half miles frflm
here late today.
"I want my mamma," the little
girl cried weakly as searchers came
upon her. She had been chained by
her ankles in a narrow hole about
two and a half feet wide which
looked like a grave.
On the floor of her prison was a
jug of water, a leaf of bread, and
some vegetable matter. Little June
was sunburned, dirty, and covered
with vermin. She was taken to the
home of Bernabe Robles, her aged
grandfather.
Tlie key to the padlock which held
her chained into the hole was found
lying nearby. District Attorney' C.
Huston could not get into the hole.
So he threw the key to June, who
unlocked it herself.
She was so weak she could hardly
walk.
