# CINDER STARS LEAVING SAT.; TO DROP IC4A
## Faculty Committee Okehs B.A.C. Action But Plans Change PREFERS N.C.A.A. MEET Rumor Has Troy Planning To Visit Penn. 
### 
Agreeing to the entrance of seven
Stanford athletes in the Intercolle
giate A.A.A.A. track and field meet
at Philadelphia May 25 and 26, and
at the same time withdrawing mem
bership from that event in favor of
the National Collegiate Athletic As
sociation in future years, the Fac
ulty Athletic Committee last evening
placed approval on the Board of
Athletic Control action of Monday
night.
As a result, Coach Dink Temple
ton and his team will entrain for
Philadelphia Saturday night, hope
ful of regaining the championship
which they last won in 1929.
The decision, climaxing a series of
bickerings which started last Feb
ruary, was based purely on policy of
the University and agreed with the
school's attitude in previous years.
"1.C.4-A. Not Representative"
In withdrawing from the 1.C.4-A.,
the committee said that the Intercol
legiates is not a truly representative
meet, such as the one conducted by
the N.C.A.A.
The seven competitors who will
represent Stanford are John Lyman
and Gordon Dunn in the shot and
discus, Al Blackman in the 400-
meters run, John Mottram in the
javelin, Sam Klopstock in the 110-
meter high hurdles and 200-meter
low hurdles, Bud Deacon in the pole
vault, and Chuck Nimmo in either
the 800-meters run or the 1500-
meters run, probably the former.
In practice yesterday, Dunn got
off one of his best discus tosses of
the year, sending the platter 157 feet.
The Cards probably will be on the
same train as the University of Cali
fornia team, which last night had not
been officially announced.
U.S.C. May Enter
There was some talk of the pos
sibility of University of Southern
California entering a team as the re
sult of Stanford's action, but it had
not been verified at a late hour last
night, although Associated Press was
seeking to contact authorities in Los
Angeles.
The faculty group is composed of
Dr. Thomas A. Storey, chairman;
Dr. J. P. Mitchell, secretary; Profes
sor W. B. Owens, Professor Eliot G.
Mears, and Professor Joseph Hinsey.
Its statement follows:
'"The Faculty Athletic Committee
for some years has questioned the
policy of authorizing track teams to
attend the 1.C.4-A. meets and has
sanctioned each trip with increasing
reluctance.
"The Board of Athletic Control,
also for several years, has not made
provisions for these trips in its reg
ular budgets, and thus year twice
voted definitely not to send the team,
only to change its position at the
last moment.
"The 1.C.4-A. was originally, and
still is primarily, an Eastern meet.
The committee feels that, if exten
sive trips are to be authorized, it
should be for participation in a na
tional meet, such as that conducted
by the National Collegiate Athletic
Association. The committee may
sanction trips for the latter purpose
if such participation docs not in
volve a conflict with the academic
program.

Racoons are occasionally found on
the Stanford campus.
