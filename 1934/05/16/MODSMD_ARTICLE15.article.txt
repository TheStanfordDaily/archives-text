# Sponsors for '800' Chosen
## 
### 
Selection of women sponsors has |
been completed by the Women's j
Council and approved by President
Wilbur. Announcement of the final
selection will be made as soon as the
individual women have been con- j
tacted and their acceptance of the
positions received.
Since the choices of living quar
ters and division of sponsors among |
the thi-ee main dormitories, and i
Mariposa, Madrono, and Elm Cot
tages, do not coincide, adjustments
and preferences will have to be I
worked out. Names of the new '
sponsors will be reserved until ar
rangements are definite, according to i
Jeanne Millard, president of the
A.W.S., who is conferring with those
selected.
