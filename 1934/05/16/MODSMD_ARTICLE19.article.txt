# Stanford Scientists Use Many Kinds of Animals

### RUSSELL PAINE 
Animal experimentation at Stan- |
ford represents an important phase 1
of scientific study and research in j
psychology, biology, anatomy, bac- I
teriology, and zoology.
Varying from the lowest types of
fine-celled animals to the higher |
types of mammals, the animals in use
on the campus reccivc the best of
care, much better than in the wild
state.
Monkeys are used by Dr. Edwin
W. Schultz, professor of bacteriology
and experimental pathology for i
making studies of infantile paralysis. :
About 50 of the animals are being
kept at present.
Some of the most interesting of the
animal experiments are being done
in the anatomy department under the
supervision of Dr. Charles H. Dan- i
forth. Working with chickens and
mice, Dr. Danforth has made studies
of anaemia, principally through the
observance of the complete stages
of the embryo. He tries to predict I
whether a pair of mice will produce i
anaemic young by knowing their j
ancestry.

Experiments with chickens irir
elude skin grafting to change feather
growth and the feeding of thyroxin
to note sexual differences.
Other studies are being made on
salamanders and frogs by Dr. Victor
C. Twitty of zoology who is ob
serving development of the embryo
stages.
Work with the lower forms of ani
mal life has been done by Dr. Harry
B. Torrey, Miss I. M. McCrackcn,
and by Chester Wright, a student.
Dr. Torrey has been using sea urch
ins and hydroids in hi.s study of de
velopment processes. He stressed
that the animals are selected not
for themselves but. for their economy
and usefulness in experiments.
Miss McCrackcn is working with
silk worms. Wright, is making a
study of the life history of slugs.
Dr. Calvin P. Stone, in charge of
animal psychology, is experimenting
with rats which are used to study
behavior under controlled conditions.
Other animals in use include a
horse, dogs, a cat and kittens, quail,
English sparrows, frogs, pheasants,
and rabbits.
