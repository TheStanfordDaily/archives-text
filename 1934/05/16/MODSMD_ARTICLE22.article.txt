j tour of the world through the me- j
j dium of rare records from his exten- i
j sive library, Henry Cowell, com- I
i poser and musical authority, last i
i night spoke in the Assembly Hall on J
| "Striking Examples of Folk and |
Primitive Music," as part of the j

l appreciation. "People lack all around j
I musical knowledge," he said. "They ,
■ know a Chinese mandarin robe when [
i they see one, or a Japanese print, or I
' a Baline.se batik, yet they cannot tell ,
! the difference between the music of;
i China, Japan, and Java."
Cowell began his tour with the j
| folk music of England, playing a
i ballad entitled "The Murder of Ma- i
j rian Martin." This he followed with J
i a 'traditional Irish song, sung in i
Gaelic, then played music influenced
|by the Orient, including Serbian,
Greek, and Albanian.
A modern Russian .song, adapted
to an old folk tune, described the
coming of the first tractor to the
' land. Ancient Persian music, Bur- |
\ mese, and Siamese operas, and a j
South Sea island mountain chant,
followed.
Cowell concluded his
with a beautiful Balinese opera, fea
i luring a large orchestra of percus
sion instruments, and then left his '
i audience to "walk home from Bali.
