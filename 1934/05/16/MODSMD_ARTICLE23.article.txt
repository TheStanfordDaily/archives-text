student body for giving me the
chance to be of service during the
next 12 months.
"We expect to encounter some
difficulties under the new Constitu

organizations under general student
body control. I hope that we will be
able to secure the looked-for co
operation fitim the women and that
next year's Executive Committee
may work harmoniously for the de

"To John Mottram, who was a good
sportsman from start to finish, I
convey my sincere lhanks for a clean
battle. I consider it an honor to have
been able to win from a man of his
type.

able to carry out next year."
