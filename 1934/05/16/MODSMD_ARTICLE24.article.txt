SAN FRANCISCO, May 15 (/P).â€”
Increased tension in the longshore
men's strike rent San Francisco to
day, as one man was killed and 65
injured in wild rioting at Los Ange
les, with Governor James Rolph, Jr.,
appealing to President Roosevelt for
arbitration.
Anticipating renewed violence Los
Angeles police established a special
detail of 158 patrolmen at the docks
and warned that "the department is
through with soft-soaping long
shoremen and is prepared to use
drastic measures."
Wild fighting occurred between
strike pickets and non-union work
ers. Police said longshoremen wield
ed baseball bats and long iron bars.
Dick Parker, 20, who had joined
the union yesterday, was shot to
death by John Knudsen, 45, injured
severely. Police said 22 other men
required medical attention and 43
others suffered lesser injuries.
At San Francisco, authorities said
a parade was to be hold protesting
the shooting of workers.
Police at Los Angeles, however,
said a check of patrolmen's firearms
disclosed that no member of the city
police had fired the bullets that
killed Parker.
The strike started May 9 when the
longshoremen demanded higher pay
and other considerations and has tied
up commerce almost completely
along the Pacific Coast. This led
Governor Rolph to send an urgent
message to the President requesting
that arbitration steps be taken at
once.
