Every year about this time, a few haystacks in the vi
cinity of Encina Hall go up in smoke, Ihe result of pranks
played by youthful-minded individuals whose names sel
dom are learned.
The I Diversity does not own that hav. It is sold to a
man who harvests the crop to make his living expenses.
The thoughtlessness of people who think it funny to see a
haystack afire is shameful, when those flames are fn real
ity licking up something which really is a man's hroad and
butler.
In line with the prevention of spontaneous combustion,
it is necessary that the hay be left in stacks for a period of
nearly a month until it is cured. It is not economical to
move the hay twice, although perhaps it might be as long
as foolish freshmen and thoughtless outsiders think that
they must commit an act of that nature.
In case the Administration is fortunate enough to lay
its hands on tlie guilty parlies, we suggest that the indi
viduals be starved for three or four days. Maybe they will
then realize what sort of trouble they are causing others.

The Daily does not mean Ibis editorial in defense of
the Administration. There have been instances where the
hay has stood long enough to be cured —and then left
enough longer to entice a few stupid people into lighting
some of the stacks.
If other arrangements could be made, much more satis
faction could be had on all sides.
