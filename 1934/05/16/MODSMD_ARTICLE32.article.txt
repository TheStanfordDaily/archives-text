# WHY IT'S NEWS
## How's Business? 
### CROMPTON BANCS Jr 
Business is getting better; it has
been getting better since last No
vember. A week ago, prosperity was
just as far away as it was last sum
mer. But last July was the high
spot in the present recovery. After
that came a slump lasting until No
vember — then the present climb.
What Ls going to happen in the next
lew weeks?
Business forecasters looking into
the crystal ball of the stock ticker
are wearing deep frowns. There are
reasons why they shouldn't be wor
ried and there are reasons why they
should. Let's look at the bright side
first
FIRST—
THE BRIGHT SIDE
In the past business usually picked
up around Easter then fell off in tne
late spring. This year things kept
right on going; people kept right on
buying after Easter. This was good
because it was unexpected. Now
business hopes it will be surprised
again.
Automobiles are being made and
; old at, a faster rate than any time
: lnce 1930—which was a pretty good
year. Nearly a hundred thousand
(ars are taking to the roads every
week. Surprisingly enough, business
kept on getting better all last month
and the first part of this month.
Wearing broad smiles and looking
for the biggest profits in four years,
motormen expect the demand to hold
up until July. If it does, it means
more business for the steel and rub
ber industries, as well as jobs for ;i
hundred thousand more men.

, Railroads are hoping for a good
year. More freight cars are being
loaded than any time during the past
three years. More people are travel
ing. The Chicago fair is expected to
boost rail travel even more.
NOW—
THE DARK SIDE
There are two things which turn
the bright picture dark; (1) Most of
the spending so far has been by the
U.S.—not by private sources; (2)
prices have gone up too fast.
Observers have noticed that wher
ever government money (CWA,
SERA, AAA, etc.) is handed out,
business gets a lot better. When the
U.S. stops giving out money, busi
ness gets much worse. The govern
ment can't go on spending forever—
at least not without ruining its credit
and everybody else's credit. So up
til private business is willing to in
vest and spend money, things will
i not get much better.
The NRA codes gave manufactur
ers and wholesalers a fine chance to
jack up prices. They did, but they
went too far. People refused to buy
at the higher prices. Department
j store sales are actually lower than a
1 year ago. Some .stores are now
catching on, and there are more
"sales" than usual at this time of
, year.
Finally, there Ls one thing to re
member. F.R. can give business an
other boost by turning on a little
more inflation and a little more
spending. Because an election is
coming up, business has to be kept
i Sf'»d.
