### BOB LETTS 
TIME TO BUY
A QUAD
Business Manager Hal Whitfield of
the Quad, which this year is going
to pictures in a big way, is quite
irked over the lackadaisical attitude
of the Senior Class.
In the section for the graduating
class, there are 540 pictures. Yet,
less than 300 have come forth with
the stipend to reserve a book. At
the beginning of last month, the 1934
Quad sales were 200 below the cor
x-eiponding period of 1933. At the
present moment, they are exactly 1
even with the 1933 figures. Ergo,
they stand a chance of selling out
even befoi'e the book comes off the i
press on May 29.
Seniors, when they were lower
classmen, frequently postponed such
purchases until their graduating
year. Now they are still postponing j
them. If they aren't careful, they'll
be in the same boat as th6se who I
received their sheepskins last year j
and didn't buy a Quad —and who j
since have been disappointed when
they wrote in to buy a book and
found that none was available.
The Quad, Manager Whitfield re
minds us, always "has been recog
nized as a Senior Class publication." >
It seems only right that the afore- !
mentioned class should support the j
aforementioned publication.

One nice young lady on the Quad,
was leading Monday's Razz edition j
of The Daily and said, in a very ser- j
ious tone, to her lady friend, "I (
can't imagine Johnny Mottram and |
Marvie Kahn making those state- !
ments." Neither could we.

NOT A BAD IDEA
TO USE, ON OCCASION
One Stanford freshman, who evi- !
dently has become a loyal member of ;
this school rapidly, let out some of i
his steam in this letter back to his j
prep school paper:
"After reading the articles of the ;
adherents and various supporters of i
the Eastern colleges, I have decided I
that our University, Stanford, needs
mention as a possible alma mater for
future Andover graduates.
"It is my contention that one can
learn about the same things no mat
ter where he goes to college; there
fore I shall merely deal with the
other advantages of Stanford Uni
versity.
"First, Stanford is co-educational,
but not obnoxiously so. There will
be not more than one woman to
every three men. Thus one does not
have the excessively virile atmos
phere which flourishes about this
great seat of learning. In addition to j
this the competition is very keen be- |
cause of the small number of girls, j
so that one gets no chance to get'
self-satisfied, but is kept mentally
stimulated.
"Secondly, the climate is very j
balmy and soothing. It is like An- j
dover in the spring term all year
round, a fact which should influence
everyone who has ever waded
through a winter at P.A.
"Thirdly, the work is hard enough
to keep one amused, but not hard
enough to cause any undue worry
and consequent loss of sleep.
"If you wish to develop brain,
body, and personality in the most
comfortable and pleasant manner,
come to Stanford.
"Dine, dance, and romance with
gorgeous women; play games in the
warm sun; and last, but not least,
study in the cool, sweet-scented
shade of the orange groves.
"Cheerfully yours,
"XXX."
