# BULL SESSION
## HAY, HAY! 
### 
Every spring quarter the statisti
cal fiction of the mental superiority
of Stanford students suffers a severe
jolt with the annua! firing of the
campus haystacks.
As long as Stanford has been here, j
there have been haystacks; and as j
long as there have been haystacks, |
there have been hay fires. Every i
time some gleeful firebug touches off
one of the neat little piles, the Uni- '
versity stands a loss of eight dollars \
on every ton of the dried grass con- ;
sumed by flames. Last year 12 tons i
of potential horse-feed went up in j
smoke.
Bowed down and embittered by j
many years of fires, the Administra- j
tion has turned fatalist, and recon- j
ciled itself to shelling out dollars for j
student stupidity, or squeezing i
something out of Encinamen when i
it is able. The only answer to the
fire trouble has been a puny re
sponse from a junk heap known as j
the Stanford fire department. Rut |
even the better among the nation's i
fire departments inevitably arrive on !
the scene after the fire has started; i
the local division usually goes the I
rest of the country one step better.
Any steps to prevent fires from oc- j

curving, other than a dogged and
doomed appeal to the good sense of
the student body, have been utterly
lacking.
Having once been a boy scout, we
feel in a position to offer some sug
gestions, which, although they may
not stop fires, will make it more dif
ficult for pyromaniacs to satisfy their
costly impulses.
As it is now, it is so easy to start a
fire that even the most timid of fire
bugs Ls tempted to try his skill. There
are not even the most elementary
precautions taken to keep matches
and cigarettes out of the brown pas
tures. Ten-foot firebreaks surround
ing the individual stacks, and
barbed-wire fencing surrounding the
fields of stacks, might well serve to
turn the acres behind the Library
into a spring quarter no-man's-land.
Danger of being caught in the act
would be highly increased; danger
from carelessness would be effect
ively decreased.
Such of course are only sugges
tions. But when the only other policy
is one of sitting, until the seat gets
too hot, it would seem that anything
is worth a try. Mahomet did not
wait for the mountain to come to
him. â€”Dave Mellinkoff
