## 
### 
Dr. Carl Lucas Alsberg, director
of Stanford's Food Research Insti
tute, has returned to the campus
after an absence of three weeks,
during which he traveled thousands
of miles throughout the United
States with the newly-created Com
mission of Inquiry on National Policy
in International Economic Relations.
The Commission, a non-partisan
body financed by the Rockefeller
Foundation, and appointed by Presi
dent Franklin D. Roosevelt, under
the auspices of the Social Science
Research Council, gathered data to
submit to President Roosevelt in a
report October 1.
Dr. Alsberg went to New York
City then traveled with the Com
mission to Des Moines, Denver, San
! Francisco, Huston, and New Orleans.
Dr. Alsberg states that in the inid
' west, and on the Pacific Coast, a
strong sentiment exists for a down
ward revision of the tariff. In sec
tions normally pro-tariff opinions
were divided, he reports on the le
ciprocal trade agreements between
United States and foreign countries.
