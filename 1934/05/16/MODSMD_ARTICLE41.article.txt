ONLY TIIE BEST
IN N.C.A.A.
A further evidence of (he great
improvements made by modern track
athletes over the performances of
their predecessors is evidenced by
the list of times and distances which
participants in the N.C.A.A. meet in
Los Angeles June 22 and 23 must
measure up to if they are to receive
expense money from the $25,000 ap
propriation made for the meet.
This list was drawn up in order to
eliminate as far as possible second
rate athletes who would have no
chance of scoring points and would
merely clutter up the field. But it
certainly takes an athlete of the
highest calibre to qualify even for
the trip. However, in order to elimi
nate the possibility of keeping out
some athlete just rounding into form
and who might break into the score
column, men who haven't marks
equal to the listed ones will be al
lowed to enter, or paying their own
expenses, and their money will be
refunded to them if they make a
satisfactory showing.
TIMES AND
DISTANCES LISTED
Standards to which the entrants
must measure up to are:
100-yard dash—9.7 seconds
220-yard dash—2l.3 seconds
440-yard dash —48.9 seconds
880-yard run —1:54
Mile run —4:22
Two-mile run —9:40
High hurdles—ls seconds
Low hurdles—24 seconds
Broad jump—24 feet
High jump—(i feet 4 inches
Shot-put—4B feet
Discus —145 feet
Javelin—l9s i'eet
INDIANS OUT
OF THREE EVENTS
Based on these standards, Stanford
will be unrepresented in three
events, the 880, the high jump, and
the two-mile. However, there is a
strong possibility that Chuck Nimmo
will cut under 1:54 in the half-mile
and that one of the Indian high
jumpers will clear 6 feet 4 inches.
That is the at which Lloyd
Schween won the event in the first
U.S.C. meet last year so he should
be able to reach it again this year.
The announcement that Stanford
will be represented by seven men in
the 1.C.4-A meet in Philadelphia
May 18 and 19 makes it a strong pos
sibility that the intercollegiate title
will again go to the West. It has
been won every year since 1921, with
the exception of Yale's 1924 victory,
by either Stanford, California, or
TJ.S.C. For the past five or six years,
Stanford and U.S.C. have finished
one, two wjjji the Trojans having an
edge in victories. —Tremaine

nate the possibility of keeping out
some athlete just rounding into form
and who might break into the score
column, men who haven't marks
equal to the listed ones will be al
lowed to enter, or paying their own
expenses, and their money will be
refunded to them if they make a

TIMES AND
DISTANCES LISTED
Standards to which the entrants
must measure up to are:
100-yard dash—9.7 seconds
220-yard dash—2l.3 seconds
440-yard dash —48.9 seconds
880-yard run —1:54
Mile run —4:22
Two-mile run —9:40
High hurdles—ls seconds
Low hurdles—24 seconds
Broad jump—24 feet
High jump—(i feet 4 inches
Shot-put—4B feet
Discus —145 feet
Javelin—l9s i'eet
INDIANS OUT
OF THREE EVENTS
Based on these standards, Stanford
will be unrepresented in three
events, the 880, the high jump, and
the two-mile. However, there is a
strong possibility that Chuck Nimmo
will cut under 1:54 in the half-mile
and that one of the Indian high
jumpers will clear 6 feet 4 inches.
That is the at which Lloyd
Schween won the event in the first
U.S.C. meet last year so he should
be able to reach it again this year.
The announcement that Stanford
will be represented by seven men in
the 1.C.4-A meet in Philadelphia
May 18 and 19 makes it a strong pos
sibility that the intercollegiate title
will again go to the West. It has
been won every year since 1921, with
the exception of Yale's 1924 victory,
by either Stanford, California, or
TJ.S.C. For the past five or six years,
Stanford and U.S.C. have finished
one, two wjjji the Trojans having an
edge in victories. —Tremaine
ONLY TIIE BEST
IN N.C.A.A.
A further evidence of (he great
improvements made by modern track
athletes over the performances of
their predecessors is evidenced by
the list of times and distances which
participants in the N.C.A.A. meet in
Los Angeles June 22 and 23 must
measure up to if they are to receive
expense money from the $25,000 ap
propriation made for the meet.
This list was drawn up in order to
eliminate as far as possible second
rate athletes who would have no
chance of scoring points and would
merely clutter up the field. But it
certainly takes an athlete of the
highest calibre to qualify even for
the trip. However, in order to elimi
nate the possibility of keeping out
some athlete just rounding into form
and who might break into the score
column, men who haven't marks
equal to the listed ones will be al
