# Frosh Meet Sophomore Soccer Players Today
## 
### 
Bitter over their failure to deieat
the juniors last Monday, acting Cap
tain Dick Bullis' frosh soccermcn
will take the field this afternoon
against the series trailing sophomore
squad.
With a win Monday the freshmen
would have cinched the winners'
title but now need a victory this
afternoon for a tie with the juniors,
who are doped to beat the seniors
Thursday. Barney Vierling's sopho
more team has already lost two
games and has no points in series
standings as compared with three
each for the juniors and freshmen
and two for the seniors.
