Gives Statements
A statement issued by the spon

politicians and diplomats alone. Real
peace can be built only upon the
combined hearts of the people, es
pecially of promising students upon
whom the world tomorrow depends.
"We, therefore, open the first
American - Japan Conference this
summer through which we can ex
change our opinions so that we may
discover and analyze coincidences
and conflicts of opinions of the peo
ple on various problems confronting
the woi'ld today."
Stanford's representation of five

mittee composed of Professor Payson
J Treat, Yamato Ichihashi, and Gra
ham Stuart.
