AIRLINES â€”One of the Pacific
Coast's most sickening programs is
. that of A1 Pearce and his gang. This
i airing, once good, now devotes itself
; to advertising and jokes which were
I new when Joe Miller was a yearling
and his joke book just a future pos
i sibility.
Somewhat curious, this writer one
day timed the length of the pro
j gram's plugs. Result: 20 minutes of
J blurbs for the sponsor in a one-hour
program. A1 Pearce, though he
should know better, fails to realize
that the average listener will not
, listen to more than a limited amount
of advertising. Consequently, his
program is constantly losing in pop
j ularity.
Gus Arnheim and his ace band will
| soon take over the famous Los An
j geles dancing spot now occupied by
Ted Fio-Rito and his rhythmless
I organization. Seems as though
; "Teddy" isn't going over so well re
' cently, as he has also lost the cigar

ette account which meant so much
to his band. Arnheim will be re
placed by the danceable melodies of
Carol Lofner and his orchestra, one
of the Coast's better musical organi
zations. \
