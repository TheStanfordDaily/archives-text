# PLANS FOR ANNUAL SPORTS DECATHLON NEAR COMPLETION
## Awards, Trophies Will Be Announced Soon 
### 
With plans almost completed for
Stanford's first annual All-Sports
Decathlon, several announcements
concerning awards are expected to
be made within the next few days by
the individuals and organizations
planning to donate trophies. It Is
planned to give a small cup to the
individual winner, a larger perpetual
trophy to the living group whose
athletes score the highest average
number of points, and to keep a per
manent trophy in the Encina gym
trophy room which will be engraved
with the individual winner's name
each year.
Explanation of some of the events
is needed as they are not all com
mon, but were selected with an eye
to the all-around athletic ability
needed to make a high score in them.
Fence Climb
The eight-foot fence climb Ls not
similar to wall-scaling, and experi
ence in that will be of no aid to the
athlete. The entrant places his hands
on the top of the fence and at the
starting signal pulls himself up and
over and dashes five yards. This
event is considered an excellent test
of agility.
The handball serve for distance is
used as a test of co-ordination and
ability to distribute weight properly
in athletics. The participant stands
behind a line 10 feet from the wall
of the court upon which is painted a
line 10 feet high, beneath which the
ball must be served. The idea is to
strive for distance rather than ac
curacy, and each contestant will be
allowed three trials, the longest of
which shall count. However, the
measurements will be made at a 90-
degree angle from the wall and dis
tance will not be measured on a
circle as in the shot-put or discus in
track.
Football Sled Push
It has been said that the football
sled push gives an advantage to a
big man, but the sled is small enough
so that even a small college student
who is fully developed has no trou
ble pushing it. The test is to push
it 20 yards for time, and is a meas
ure of leg drive and back strength.
Entries are still being received on
the intramural bulletin board in En
cina gym and by Dave Cooke at the
Phi Psi house, Giff Meyers at the
Chi Psi house, Marvie Kahn at En
cina, and Earl Hoos of Toyon.
