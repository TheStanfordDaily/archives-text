Even glass insulators behave badly toward tele
phone currents when humidity is high. This lias
been proved by experiments at Bell Telephone
Laboratories.
When it's humid, a film of moisture forms on
the glass. The more humid, the thicker the film
— and the more electrical current escapes! Im
portant factors governing amount of leakage are
the chemical nature of the glass, its shape and age,
the amount and kind of dirt on its surface.
Through exhaustive studies, telephone men have
developed more efficient types of glass insulators
— and are seeking ways to make them still better.
Close attention to every detail of Bell System
equipment leads to constantly improving service.
