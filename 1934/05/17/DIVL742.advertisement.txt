PAMPER PATTIES WHEN PROM PRANCING!
BOUND I N CHAINS â€”
. . . Chains of golden and silvered
leather . . .
Thus will be many a fair co-ed's dainty foot.
On the eventful formal Prom-nite and still
again on the informal Saturday-nite ....
The new metallic leather evening sandals will
peep out from under swirling gowns at the
right times and places. . . . Their heels are
low for comfiness; their soles were made to
dance upon; their chains to enslave unat
tached hearts. . . .
The formula for Prom Success:
Two Dainty feet - - - Two Chained-leather
evening sandals - - - One evening of
sublime perfection!
