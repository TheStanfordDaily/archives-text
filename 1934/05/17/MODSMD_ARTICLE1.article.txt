# COMMITTEE OF JUNIOR DANCE FINISH PLANS
## Ernie Heckscher's Music Obtained for 9-1 In Dance Studio PROM HELD TOMORROW Limited Number of Tickets Still on Sale 
### 
Tomorrow celebrates the classic
event of the spring quarter, the
Junior Prom. Pointing to a new
record in Proms, Chairman Marvie
Kahn announces that preparations
for the gala affair are nearing com
pletion.
Dancing to the tantalizing strains
of Ernie Heckscher and his 15-piece
orchestra will last from 9 until 1
o'clock in the dance studio of the
Women's gym. With the orchestra
in the balcony for the first time in
the history of the studio, something
new is in store for Prom attenders.
Ernie Heckscher plans a special sur
prise for the occasion.
Lighting Arranged
Accompanying the music will be
soft lights, all colors of the rainbow.
Indirect skylines reflected from mir
rors, splashy red and white awnings,
revolving doors, and trellises twined
with roses will transform the dance
studio into a glorified penthouse.
Punch is to be served from a spe
cially constructed bar. Everywhere
in evidence will be snappily uni
formed bell-hops at the service of
the dancers.
A last-minute rush for bids for
the Prom late yesterday further
limited the supply, but there are
still about 25 left for the first-com
ers tomorrow. They may be ob
tained in the A.S.S.U. oflice of the
Old Union for $3.00.
