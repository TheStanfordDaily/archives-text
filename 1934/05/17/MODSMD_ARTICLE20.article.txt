# 10-Cent Fee Set for New Play Tonight
## Sword, Sandals Presenting Play Tonight for First Time in America Mary Liles, James Benet Appear in Reading 
### 
In accordance with its policy of j
charging a small admission fee to
readings when a royalty must be
paid, Sword and Sandals announces
a 10-cent charge for the reading this j
evening of George Bernard Shaw's
play, "On the Rocks."
This new dramatic comment upon
the current world situation by the
eminent Irish playright will receive
its first American performance to- i
night. To James Benet, well-known
campus actor, falls the delicate task
of characterizing Sir Arthur Cha
vender, Prime Minister of Great
Britain.
London Is Sccne
Mary Liles, who has appeared in I
several readings as well as in the re- I
cent production of "Doctor Faustus,"
is to be the mysterious lady who !
confronts the Prime Minister and j
eventually stirs him out of his self- i
satisfaction into thought.
"On the Rocks" as a play bears \
certain physical resemblances to the j
melodrama "Wings over Europe,"
which achieved great success on the !
campus several years ago. The ac- I
tion in both plays is laid in the cabi- .
net rooms at 49 Downing Street, j
London. In both plays the cast is J
composed largely of cabinet mem- J
bers of various types of mind. And j
both plays concern a climatic mo
ment in history.
Prophecy Startling
But here Shaw differs from
Browne and Nichols, the authors of
the "Wings over Europe." He is
concerned not with a fantastic situ- |
ation and a master mind, but with
the current political and economic |
disarroy and a group of puzzled and ]
uncertain human beings. His com- j
ment and prophecy are acid and !
startling as ever.
The reading will begin promptly
at 7:30 o'clock in the Little Theatre j
at which time the doors will be
closed to latecomers.
