# Collectivism Wins Rogers Forum Vote
## Audience Lauds New Deal, Rejects G.O.P. Policy Of Individualism Much Heckling Hampers Fullenwider Argument 
### 
Rugged individualism battled col
lectivism, and rugged individualism
lost by a 7 to 1 student vote in last
night's Forum, held in room 214 of
the English building.
Collectivism, the winner, was car
ried to victory by Bill Rogers, de
bater and poloist, on the back of
the Democratic donkey. Rogers
pointed out that the main differences
between individualism and the New
Deal are exemplified by the Roose
veltian attitudes toward charity,
fixed charges, control of securities,
and control of competition.
New Deal Inspires
He further maintained that, al
though the New Deal leaves much
to be desired in the matter of con
crete results, it has blazed a trail
showing the way for future genera
tions to follow. It has fostered many
economically and politically pro
gressive ideas which will form a
foundation upon which succeeding
leaders may build.
Rugged individualism was up
held by Frank Fullenwider with the
aid of the Grand Old Party and its
ponderous pachyderm, which pach
yderm, incidentally, the assemblage
agreed was extremely decrepit, if
not actually deceased.
Freedom Claimed
Fullenwider, through a constant
fire of heckling from the floor, con
tended that "the American citizen is
a rugged individualist, and as such
wants to stand on his own feet, earn
his own living, and not be a link in
the chain of co-operation."
He pointed out that present poli
ticians are incapable of efficient or
ganization of the present great in
dustrial machine, and putting such
men in control would be the worst
thing that could happen to modern
business.
Several impromptu arguments
from the floor followed the conclu
sion of scheduled talks, each side
of the argument having its adher
ents. The final vote, however, with
its overwhelming majority, showed
that the greater portion of the spec
tators favored a continuance of the
co-operative ideas personified by
democracy.
