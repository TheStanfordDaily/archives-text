# "Soup Bowl" Haircut is Out, Says Stanford's Barber Jim
##

I Styles for haircuts just as clothes
and car styles vary.
Have you ever had your hair
trimmed by the traditional "soup
bowl method? Many students, par
j ticularly those reared in rural areas,
were undoubtedly subjected to such
custom, by which the bowl was
j firmly placed on the cranium and
j all hair below the rim removed.
According to Jim Pennington, bet
| ter known as just "Jim," head barber
in the Union Cellar shop, the great
est change in vogue during his 17
j years on the campus occurred about
| 15)22 with the cessation of military
j cut.
The military style, which was in
the height of its rage from 11) 18 1o
1920, consisted of cutting the hair in
a straight line clear around and just
above the ears. The line of division
was then carefully shaved to com
plete the job. Shortness and con-

venience were the all-important
things for the "rough," the main
stem being to keep the hair from
growing into and around the ears.
Women have never enjoyed the
free use of the Union Barber Shop.
When bobbed hair became the style
some of the "500" made use of the
shop, but barbers and men students
soon made it evident that the con
fines of the barber hall should be
entirely masculine.
The fair eo-eds took the hint, Jim
said, and soon treked down to Palo
Alto beauty shoppes.
Hair vogues during the past few
years have changed very little, Jim
explained. Sideburns have become a
trifle longer, but in general the
methood of cutting has remained
fixed. The type of combing, whether
pompadour or with a part, makes
little difference to the professional
barber.
