# STAN BEAUBAIRE ELECTED EDITOR OF NEW VOLUME
## Herman Named Business Manager by Ottenheimer; Chappell, Hamilton New Associate Editors; Jacobs Managing Editor 
### 
CJiAN BLAUBAIRE was elected editor of The Stanford Daily, Volume 8(>,
by a decisive margin yesterday afternoon when staff members cast their
ballots in the first election held under the new preferential voting system
by the Ex Committee last week.
Bob Herman was named business manager for Volume 8(i yesterday by
Louis Ottenhcimer, retiring business manager, and accepted by the Publi-

cations Council. This appointment
has yet to be accepted by the Ex
Committee. Bud Van Meter was de
feated for the appointment.
Beaubaire, retiring associate edi
tor, won over Jay Graves, also a re
tiring associate editor, and Albert
Guerard, Jr., whose name was placed
on the ballot by a petition signed by
over half the voting members of the
staff. The vote, that required only
the counting of first choices, was:
Stan Beaubaire 21
Jay Graves 8
Albert Guerard, Jr... 11
Joining the staff in the autumn
quarter of 1331, Beaubaire has held
various editorial staff positions until
he was named associate editor at the
close of Volume 84.
Herman came on the Daily staff in
his freshman year, 1931, and has
worked up through the lower busi
ness positions. In the fall of 1933 he
was appointed to the office of Palo
Alto advertising manager.
Business staff promotions will be
made by Herman in the near future,
he said last night.
While the staff was voting, the
Editorial Board met and made the
following appointments:
Managing editor, Julius Jacobs;
women's editor, Tamaki Nao; as
sociate editors, Charles Chappell
and Francis Hamilton; news edi
tor, Frank Orr.
Night editors, Robert Calkins,
Robert Jones (incumbent), John
Kline, Barbara Fowler, Edwine
Montague (incumbent), Russell
Paine (alternate), Joyce Smart, and
Frank Tremaine.
Feature editor, Charlotte Bur
ridge.
A.P. editor, Belty Jane Hedden.
A.P. copy editors, Jane Dodge,
Cathlecn Hayes, George Wilson.
Sports editor, Millard Browne.
Women's sports editor, Anne Van
Wormer.
Review editor, Henry Brill.
Copy readers, Barbara Sweet,
Emerson Honan, Cedric Larson, and
John McClelland.
Take Office in Fall
The new staff will not take office
until autumn quarter, though pre
liminary organization will begin im
mediately. All other members of
the editorial staff will retain their
present positions.
Two recommendations, to be for
warded to the Ex Committee at their
next session, were adopted by the
Editorial Board. The first was that
the news editor be made a regular
member of the Editorial Board and
the second that the women's sports
editor be made a permanent position
on the editorial staff.
If accepted by the Ex Committee,
the recommendations will be incor
porated in the Constitution by-laws
governing the Daily, drawn up by
Ottenheimer, and accepted last week.
