## Dr. Wilbur Talks Before Annual Banquet 
### 
George Cobb, Thela Xi, last night
succeeded Donn Tatum, Zeta Psi, as
president of the Interfraternity
Council at the second annual ban
quet of the council. President Ray
Lyman Wilbur was the main speaker
of the evening, assisted by members
of the faculty and cpuncil officers,
old and new.
Bob Cranmer, Phi Delta Theta,
accepted the position of council sec
retary-treasurer, succeeding Hinton
Howe, Theta Chi.
Wilbur Reminds
President Wilbur, in a straightfor
ward, forceful speech, reminded the
members of the council present that
the "straight and narrow" was al
ways the best, and that nights spent
in the highway beer parlors, if
brought to an excess, would lead to
only one thingâ€”an unhappy future
life.
He also asked that fraternities ob
serve rushing rules in the future,
and play the game not like high
school boys, but as the game should
be played by men. He stated that the
present method of compulsory fresh
man hall-rooming had so far wox-ked
out well, but that fraternities must
not be in too much of a hurry to for
mulate a pledge class.
Tatum Congratulated
Tatum congratulated the council
for its broad-minded outlook on
progressive measures and its co-op
eration in action. Cobb reviewed
the general outlook of the work of
the Council, discussed the freshman
problem, outlined plans for next
year, and congx*atulated Tatum on
his successful term.
