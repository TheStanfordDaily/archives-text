111 a I of any individual ever lo sel fool on Stanford soil,
Stanley S. Boaubaite yesterday was named bv his mates
on the Daii.v to guide the editorial ups'and downs ol the
rug for the first volume of next year.
Stan is known widely for his participation in various
enterprises, and we venture lo predict that, il he puts all
of his energy into Ibis one tiling, the D.mi.y will take some
of the Invest progressive strides in its <XC> volumes of pub
lication.
And then those associates Francis Kennedy (Spud)
Hamilton and Charles (Chuck) Chappell. A couple of ca
pable bovs, handy on the nighl desk and capable writers,
they'll soon be tilling these columns wfth more of the edi
torial drool.
On the desk are eight (more than usual) people whose
work has demanded their recognition. I hey re starting at
scratch. An editor will be picked from their midst, in all
probability. Kdwine Montague, Barbara Fowler, and Joyce
Smart will uphold the honors ol the <S()(), or 1000 or what
ever it is. Hob Jones, coming back next fall after a leave
of absence, Hob Calkins, Frank Treniaine, Johnny Kline,
and Russ Paine will be getting in their share of trouble
with the back shop.
The department heads are capable. Charlotte Burridge,
who has a good nose for news, should make the feature
editor's work one of the best ever seen. Millard Browne,
who has had some professional experience, will capably
handle the sports editor's work. Hetty Jane Hodden will
round up the Associated Press high spots. Anne Nan NN or
mer will have the honor of being the first women s sports
editor a post made necessary by the increasing "busi
ness" of the girls' gym. Henry (Bud) Brill, who has been
seen on the stage in this vicinity several times, will handle
reviews.
For the rest of the rest of the editorial board, we have
onlv the highest praise. The energetic work of lamaki
Xao has been justly rewarded with the highest honor
available to a woman member of the staff. Julius (Jake)
Jacobs, the new managing editor, will be given an oppor
tunity to gnash his teeth when he finds a proof error, and
Frank Orr, the news editor-elect, will grow his gray hairs
trying to devise methods of preventing inaccuracies from
slipping into print.
On the business side of this esteemed publication, one
good man gives way lo another. Louis Ottenheimer steps
aside in favor of Bob Herman, who has, according to re
ports, worn the elbows out of nine sweaters leaning on
counters while trying lo convince Palo Alio advertisers
that the Daily is really the best advertising medium in this
vicinity.
Well, the stage is set. The curtain will ring down on
the present "act" on June 1, ;md in the autumn another
performance will begin. Reserve your seals now. i hoy

on the Daii.v to guide the editorial ups'and downs ol the
rug for the first volume of next year.
Stan is known widely for his participation in various
enterprises, and we venture lo predict that, il he puts all
of his energy into Ibis one tiling, the D.mi.y will take some
of the Invest progressive strides in its <XC> volumes of pub
lication.
And then those associates Francis Kennedy (Spud)
Hamilton and Charles (Chuck) Chappell. A couple of ca
pable bovs, handy on the nighl desk and capable writers,
they'll soon be tilling these columns wfth more of the edi
torial drool.
On the desk are eight (more than usual) people whose
work has demanded their recognition. I hey re starting at
scratch. An editor will be picked from their midst, in all
probability. Kdwine Montague, Barbara Fowler, and Joyce
Smart will uphold the honors ol the <S()(), or 1000 or what
ever it is. Hob Jones, coming back next fall after a leave
of absence, Hob Calkins, Frank Treniaine, Johnny Kline,
and Russ Paine will be getting in their share of trouble
with the back shop.
The department heads are capable. Charlotte Burridge,
who has a good nose for news, should make the feature
editor's work one of the best ever seen. Millard Browne,
who has had some professional experience, will capably
handle the sports editor's work. Hetty Jane Hodden will
round up the Associated Press high spots. Anne Nan NN or
mer will have the honor of being the first women s sports
editor a post made necessary by the increasing "busi
ness" of the girls' gym. Henry (Bud) Brill, who has been
seen on the stage in this vicinity several times, will handle
reviews.
