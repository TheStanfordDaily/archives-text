# WHY IT'S NEWS
## A 						Campaign Without Sunny Jim 
### CROMPTON BANGS Jr 
Yesterday Governor Rolph drop
ped from the governorship race. He
is sixty-five and in bad health; his
doctors advised him not to run.
Many taxpayers have hoped and
prayed that he would not indict
himself upon the state again. As a
parting gesture, the San Francisco
News wished him "many years of
gracious living"—in private life.
At the same time Supervisor John
R. Quinn of Los Angeles inherited
ihe Rolph suporters. Many observ
ers are inclined to think he is
stronger politically than the Gov
ernor. A former national command
er of the Legion and a mild wet, he
should draw quite a few votes, al
though Rolph was always friendly
toward veterans and wets.
NO BAD OFFICE
RECORD TO RUN ON
Supervisor Quinn's biggest advan
tage is that he has no poor record
in office to fly up and hit him dur
ing the campaign. If Rolph had run,
the San Jose lynching, the rapid
disappearance of the 39 million dol
lar surplus, and general state graft
would have been too much for him.
As it is Mr. Quinn can run on his
L.A. record — which is good — and
promise the voters anything within
reason. He will have to worry about
giving jobs to the Rolph henchmen
who have joined him. A few of
them are holding out for the biggest
and juiciest jobs before joining up.
Mr. Quinn will have to give them
what they want. The Democrats are
100 strong for him to do anything
else.

THE PLATFORMS
LOOK ALIKE
Supervisor Quinn's Republican
platform looks almost like Democrat
Creel's. Both are going to "bust"
the power companies' influence in
state politics. Both are going to end
unemployment and both are going
to modernize Ihe state's much
amended constitution.
Everybody admits these things
should be done—up to a certain
point. This is where the difference
is likely to be. Voters can expect a
much more "conservative" admin
istration from Mr. Quinn than from
Mr. Creel — who means business
when he favors radical changes. So
if both arc nominated at their re
spective primaries, there may be a
clear-cut fight between "conserva
tive" and "radical" candidates.
MONEY IS
STILL SCARCE
The governorship campaign would
be a lot hotter right, now if the can
didates could get hold of some real
money to make some noise. So far,
George Creel and Frank Merriam
(Lieut. Gov., Long Beach, Republi
can) are the only ones anybody has
been willing to take a chance on.
They are reported to have contacted
ample cash—so far. The rest, in
cluding ex-Governors Young and
Richardson, may have to dig into
their own pockets.
Now that Supervisor Quinn has
inherited the Rolphites, he may get
backing from the banking and in
surance interests who supported
Jimmy in 1930. On the other hand,
some of them think Rolph was j
poor investment.
