AIRLINES—I rving Aaronson and
his Commanders have joined the list
of prominent orchestra visiting the
Pacific Coast this year, and tonight
marks their inaugural broadcast on
CBS-KFRC. Dial them in at 9:15
o'clock and you'll hear some of the
best music the Coast has claimed
this summer.
Although nol a high ranking or
ganization in popularity contests, the
Commanders are considered by mu
sicians to be among the first 10 or
chestras in the country, and the
honor is fully deserved. They have
almost unbeatable: rhythm, their
melody is good, and the various
types of instruments are far better
balanced in their orchestrations than
in those of most of the higher class
dance bands.
Radio fans who enjoy the pleas
ingly sentimental programs put on
by David Ross and Tony Wons grow
unusually enthusiastic over a little
publicized broadcast entitled "Be
tween the Bookends," aired daily
over KFRC at 1:15 o'clock. Although
heard on the Coast only during the
summer, the program has been a
regular CBS feature lor several
years. It originates in Kansas City
and presents short sentimental
poems and readings to an accom
paniment of organ music.—Emerson
M. Honan.
