MAN OF TWO WORLDS (RKO)
A( (he Varsity Theatre
English explorers in the Arctic re
gion return to London with many
exotic animals, including lago (Fran
ces Lederer), chieftain of an Eskimo
tribe.
The story deals with the attempts
of the crew to westernize him, and
with his adoration of Joan Pendleton
(Elissa Landi) as the guiding spirit
of his life.
Francis Lederer has in lago the
ideal part for the exercise of his
peculiar vitality. His acrobatics,
queer mannerisms, and fiery person
ality. are justified by his having
emanated from the land of the mid
night sun. The slightest western in
vention—the match, the photograph
—amazes him.
Miss Landi's role is minor, but
fairly well played. As the beauti
fully-gowned, titled young English
woman, she regards the Eskimo with
humor and does not treat the situa
tion with the delicacy required. But
that is the fault of the part, not of
the actress.
This is one of the few pictures
that are truly different. The sharp
contrast drawn between the two cul
tures— Continental and Arctic—is
striking and unique.
Although the film is long—nearly
two hours in running length—and in
parts slow and unnecessarily drawn
out. it is well worth seeing.—Mayer
LAUGHING BOY (MGM)
At the Stanford Theatre
This cinematic adaptation of the
popular Pulitzer prize novel is ac
curately transcribed and most con
vincing. From the point of view of
photography and the portrayal oi
Navajo life and customs it is quite
outstanding. However, in spite of the
special attention given to the photog
raphy, the picture does lose much oi
the lucid and simple beauty of tlu

book's descriptive passages.
The plot has to do with the love of
a simple Indian youth for a not
quite so simple Indian maid, brought
up under the rough tutelage of white
low-life. She, unable to live the
simple, natural life of her husband's
people, forces him to leave them and
set out for himself. She attempts ,to
maintain him financially by leading
a double-life, which action of course,
has a tragic end. In the denouement,
it is explained that "Slim Girl wasn't
bad, she just missed the way."
(Please don'l laugh, I was touched.)
In the cast are a whole swoop of
real Indians, plus Ramon Navarro
and Lupez Velez, who look like na
tives in spite of Spanish accents.
But their performances are sincere
and real. Not a magnificent picture,
but an entertaining and interesting
one in a sentimental sort of way.
BOTTOMS UP (Fox)
This farce-burlesque on Holly
wood is just another one in the long
series of travesties on that poor, be
leaguered film capital. In spite of a
practically plagiarLstic similarity to
"Once in a Lifetime," this picture has
amusing moments. —Brill
