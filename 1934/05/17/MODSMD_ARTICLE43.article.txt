# BULL SESSION
## EXIT: THE AMATEUR 
### 
In grammar school they play mar
bles "for keeps." Marble shooting
for the sheer fun of the shooting is
much too tame. Amateurs in the
field are few, and sandwiched tightly
in between the dozens who "fudge"
professionally.
Starling with "professional" mar
bles in grammar school, Americaiv
youth is well grounded in athletics
that pay. There are occasional glim
mers from beyond the Atlantic—
where a few sissy Britishers are said
to enjoy cricket ju.st because "it's
cricket '; but, for the most part, ath
letics "with something in it," are en
shrined on the sporting pedestal.
At Stanford and other American ;
universities there has always been a
mask of amateurism in athletics. The
mask, at Stanford, as at other uni- ,
versities, has not been heavy enough
to conceal the glaring professional
facts: that a great many of the "bet
ter" athletes receive scholarships,
that a number of the gridiron and
cinder greats are nurtured on ready
jobs and easy money.
The recent announcement that
otherwise ineligibles in the N.C.A.A,
meet may enter, pay their own meet
expenses, and receive refunds if they
make good showings, is further evi
dence of the rising tide of cornmer
{ cialism in the world of sports.
On the crest of that rising tide of
commercialism must come clear-cut
and sizeable salaries for athletes;
salaries, not for winding clocks and
weeding dandelions, but salaries for
i services rendered on the field of
! athletic competition. There have
I lx>en times in Stanford history when
I football men have brought down
' gate receipts totaling almost a halt
I million dollars. In any other busi-
I ness, a group of highly skilled la-
I borers who could bring in that much
| money, would themselves be hand
j somely rewarded. Stanford, in half
i hearted fashion, doles out sweaters,
| blankets, and scholarships. Such a
' policy can be described its nothing
else than "beating down labor."'
Yes, there are a few rules govern
ing amateur competition. But the
I ruies that exist are not obeyed, and
j the rules are unfair anyhow. Better
| business principle would give to la
| bor whnt labor earns. Athletes have
| but one recourse. They must or
! ganize in unions, grow militant in
i defense of th<Mr rights, and strike for
| higher wages. —Dave Mellinkoff
LONDON, May 16 OP)j — With
I many laughs and without a division,

At Stanford and other American ;

to conceal the glaring professional

that a number of the gridiron and
cinder greats are nurtured on ready
jobs and easy money.
The recent announcement that
otherwise ineligibles in the N.C.A.A,
meet may enter, pay their own meet
expenses, and receive refunds if they
make good showings, is further evi
dence of the rising tide of cornmer

On the crest of that rising tide of
commercialism must come clear-cut
and sizeable salaries for athletes;
salaries, not for winding clocks and
