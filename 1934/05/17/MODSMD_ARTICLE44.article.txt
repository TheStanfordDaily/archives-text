Representing the Romanic, Ger
manic, and Slavic languages depart
ments, Raymond D. Harriman, pro
fessor of classical languages, spoke
last, night to prospective foreign
language majors in the Little The
ater.
The new foreign language re
quirement for Lower Division stu
dents was first explained by Pro
fessor Harriman. This requirement,
which will go into effect with the
publication of the next information
announcement, makes it necessary
for a student not only to take three
years of a foreign language in high
school but to demonstrate his abil
ity to use it by taking a three-unit*
course in the lower division.
'"There is too much of a feeling
among students and teachers that
foreign languages are merely re
quirements," Harriman said. "One
should think of a knowledge of
languages as contributing to one's
recreational enjoyment, intellectual
value, and economic success."
Briefly stating the qualifications
that foreign language majors should
possess, Professor Harriman de
clared, "They should major in a
larguage who wish to teach it or
wl o have a desire to obtain a broad,
classical education. And those who
are not capable of sustained mental
effort, who are not morally capable
of appreciating the language, and
who regard languages as merely re
quirements should not major in any
language."
