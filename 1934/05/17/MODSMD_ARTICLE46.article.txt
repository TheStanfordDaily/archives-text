# "Black Magic" Used At Cat During Final Week
## 
### 
Many Cal students rely on "black
magic" to bring them good grades,
according to Professor R. L. Olson
of their Psychology Department.
One student never changes his
shirt during finals week for fear of
"jinxing" his grades, while another
wears the same tie year after year
while taking examinations.
"Many students sleep with notes
under their pillows during the night
before tests," Olson said. "This
'magic' actually brings results in
some cases, simply because of the
increased confidence it gives."
