## 
### 
With today set as the last chance
for seniors to order announcements,
programs, and personal cards, North
Baker, committee chairman, said last
night a large percentage of the class
has not placed orders yet.
Baker said he was pleased with the
way the sales have gone this week.
He emphasized the" fact that any
profits from the sales will go into
the class treasury for use during
this spring's activities.
The cards, booklets, and announce
ments may be ordered in the A.S.
S.U. or alumni offices all day.
Samples of the cover for the pro
gram booklets are now available.
The booklets, which cost 85 cents,
will arrive about June 1, Baker said.
