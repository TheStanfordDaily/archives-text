D.U.'s vs. Dckes, frosh football
field, 4:30 oVlock.

Two close games and a one-sided
shut-out comprised the results of
yesterday's playoff contests for the
intramural baseball championship.
In (he hardball division, the Sigma
Nu's blanked El Toro, 15 to 0, while
in the softball class, Phi Delta Theta
defeated Phi Delta Phi, 5 to 3, and
the A.T.O.'s won over the Betas,
8 to 5.
The best of the three games was
the one between the Phi Delts and
the Lawyers, with the former com
ing Irom behind to score four runs
in the second inning lo gain a safe
lead. After a shaky first frame, Don
Greenlee of the victors kept ihe Phi
Delta Phi's under control.
A.T.O.'s Rally
Another four-run rally gave the
A.T.O.'s a commanding advantage
over the Betas, who came from the
short end of a 7-1 count in the
fourth to stage a spree of their own
and threaten for a while. The
A.T.O.'s held their lead for the rest
of the game, however, with each
team scoring only once more.
Chuck Clancy held the El Toro's
in the palm of his hand while his
Sigma Nu mates were scoring two,
