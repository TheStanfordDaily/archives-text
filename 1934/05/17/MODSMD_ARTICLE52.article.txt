# FROSH MAY MAKE STRONG PLAY FOR CLASS BALL TITLE
## 
### 
The climax to Stanford's baseball
season will see competition between
the freshmen as a .team and the
players of the varsity divided into
their respective class teams, at the
opening of the intercla.ss games next
Monday on the varsity baseball field.
Captained by Arch Zamloch, the
men of '37 appear to be strong con
tenders for the championship be
cause of their constant team play
throughout the intercollegiate sea
son just past. However, Captain
Dick Miles' senior team, because of
each player's greater experience,
will have to be reckoned with; while
the '35 players, captained by Jack
Beach, and the men of '36, captained,
by Frank Tremaine, promise hot
competition for the rest.
The seniors, who meet the sopho
mores in the first game Monday aft
ernoon, appear to hold a balance of
strength in the pitching department,
with either Stan Anderson or Floyd
Campbell ready to take the mound.
Incentive for a senior victory is
great, as, having lost last year's
championship to the Class of 1935,
this year will be their last chance to
sweep the interclass games. Pitch
ing resistance from the sophs will
come from either John Campbell or
Blanchard, Monday's starter having
not yet been chosen.
The freshmen, who meet the jun
iors in the second game Wednesday,
have all-around pitching support
from Davis, Quade, McClure, and
Brent, but all the juniors' opponents
must face the powerful pitcher, Her
inger, who was instrumental hist
year in bringing his team the inter
class championship in a final game
victory over the Class of 1936.
