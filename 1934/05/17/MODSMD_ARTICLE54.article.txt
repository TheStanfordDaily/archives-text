# REDSHIRTS RIDING AGAINST BLACK FOX MILITARY POLOISTS SATURDAY
## 
### 
| Ordinarily a prep school team
phould prove less bothersome to
I Stanford than one from U.S.C. Cap
tain Richard Gordan and his Red
! shirt poloists don't seem to think so
j right now, and as a result a strong
j er team will face the Black Fox
J Military Institute this Saturday
than the four who defeated the Tro-
I jans last week, 11 to 5.
Games played in the south during
spring vacation proved to the In
! dians' satisfaction that the Los An
i geles riders were far above the
I average college teams, let alone high
I school outfits. Scores of Black Fox
j 6, Stanford 9, and S.C. 8, Stanford
; 14. give some idea of the strength of
I the military school team.
A new lineup has been announced
j by Captain Gordan for Saturday's
j game, including two from the first
string and two of the second-team
riders who have been showing up

! so well in recent games.
Riding at number one position
will be Bill Enemark, Luppe Lup
pen at two, Bill Rogers at three, and
i Jim Henderson at back. Frank
Burns and Cal Emeis, both second
string men, will be on hand as sub
: stitutes. Bob Fullerton and Russ
Rasmussen, the remaining first
string men, will not play, according
to Captain Gordan's present plans.
The game v/ill start at 2:30 o'clock
at the Highway Field, just beyond
the sunken diamond. It will be open
to the public.
1 No other polo games are sched
uled definitely during the rest of the
quarter, and the only one that will
probably be played will take place
at Golden Gate Park in San Fran
cisco, where the Stanford riders will
have one more chance to add to
i their victories over Will <Tevis and
! other highly rated Peninsula riders.
