# OLDTIME DANCES, HOPS FEATURE FIRST JOLLYUP
## 
### HELEN GROVER 
The first all-University jolly-up
was held with raucous robber dances
and dashing Paul Joneses at the
Palo Alto Armory on April 28, 1911.
Before that time, jolly-ups had been
, limited strictly to class affairs, and
it took Tommy Thompson, Class of
1911, to think up an all-University
j shin-dig.
A.s usual, there was no "queening"
to or from the function, and the
dainty "500" attended in the Quad
clothes of ihe time short-waists,
while the male contingent wore, as
they do today, the traditional cords.
There were two orchestras to keep
I up with the fun-loving crowd, and
additional entertainment was af
forded by occasional vaudeville
numbers.
The jolly-ups were much more of
an affair than they arp now, being
held from 7:30 or 8 o'clock until 12
o'clock. John Ezra MacDowell
chortled, "We didn't wait until 9 or

. 10 o'clock to go to a dance." The
roughs and the queens wended their
ways homeward dateless. The re
i freshments consisted of the good old
stand-bys, cider and doughnuts.
For a number of years there were
all student body jolly-ups, and then
as they tended more and more to
become class dances again, the jollyâ€”
1 up became nearly defunct.
About 1920, the custom was resur
, rected and revived as the special
prerogative of the senior class, which
gave jolly-ups the last two quarters
to arouse interest in senior week.
Today there are jolly-ups in (ho
various living groups, with an occa
sional all-University one on such
special occasions as Big Game and
the Convalescent Drive, However,
a new member of the family has
made its appearance, the "7-8." Be
cause of the large number of roughs
at the jolly-ups, the attendance was
limited by making the affair invita
tional.
