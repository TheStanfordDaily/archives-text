# Moot Court Holds Finals
## 
### 
The mythical supremacy of the
Law School will be decided tonight
when Phil and Will Ray oppose Bob
Cathcart in the traditional moot
court trial. The trial is scheduled
for 8 o'clock in Room 12.
The Ray brothers and Cathcart
have survived the preliminary moot
court competition cases conducted
earlier in the year and face each
other in the final.
Judge Henry G. Jorgensen, '07,
distinguished jurist of the Superior
Court of Monterey County, will pre
side over the case and decide the
victor. 1
The moot court tonight represents
the Supreme Court in the case of
Anderson vs. the State. The Ray ,
brothers represent Anderson, while
Cathcart is counsellor for the state. !
The trial involves a technical point
in the laws of evidence, a "question
of the admissibility of evidence in a
criminal action for involuntary man
slaughter, where evidence was' ob
tained under the hit-run statute."
The trial court held the defendant, '
Anderson, was guilty of the charge
of involuntary manslaughter. The i
Ray brothers have appealed on the
grounds that the admission of evi- I
dence of an officer constituted an
error, because it violated a law of
constitutional rights.
Both Cathcart and the Rays have
submitted briefs to the higher court,
and the final decision will be made
on the basis of the briefs and the ar
gument tonight.
Arrangements for the trial have
been made by ihe moot trial board, I
composed of Abe Mellinkoff, J<jhn
Hurlbut, George Vargas, and John
Dibble. They prepared the question,
and Secured Judge Jorgensen.
