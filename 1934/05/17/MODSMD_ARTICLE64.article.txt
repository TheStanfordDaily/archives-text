CLOSER lIOOP
HACK NEXT YEAR
With two of the biggest track
meets in the country scheduled foi
the next few weeks, this may not bt
quite the time to start talking about
'/basketball, but with three of the
lour members of the southern divi
sion working out in spring practice
and with a brand new idea being
tried out next year, it's hard to keep
the hoopsters from breaking into
print.
For the past several years, Cali
forma and U.S.C. have just about
had things their own way in basket
ball, but with graduation taking its
toll from the above mentioned two
and with Stanford and U.C.L.A.
being greatly strengthened by expe
rience and new material, it looks
as though we would have a real race
, next season instead of another two
way scrap.
BRUINS GO
FOR HEIGHT
Customarily rated as the shortest
squad in the conference, U.C.L.A. is
going to surprise the cash customers
when they make their first appear
,t. ance on the floor next winter. Last
■Aseason the Bruins averaged just 5
feet 11 Vie inches which is pretty short
for a basketball team, but right now
Caddy Works has a .squad of play
ers which averages over 6 feet 1 inch.
Of the eight men who are certain
to be on the first squad, only one,
Shelby Jones, two-year letterman,
is under 6 feet, being 1 inch shy of
that mark. The tallest is John Ball,
a 6-foot 4-inch center.
"Sit Down Sam" Barry has the
other half of the Los Angeles duo,
the Trojans, out for spring practice
and in preparation for the new
method of play in the southern di
vision which eliminates the tip-ofl'
at center. He is drilling the U.S.C.
squad in a new fast-breaking of
fense, much different from the usual
slow-breaking game played by the
Trojans. A practice game between
U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. is planned with
in a few weeks to try out the elimi
nation of the tip-off.
CARDS WILL BE
MUCH STRONGER
Coach John Bunn's squad will
probably be the strongest to repre
sent the Farm in several years. Ede
len and Rogers are lost but Topping,
Mallatratt, Cowing, Anderson, Page,
and Lindsey are all returning. The
addition of a frosh quintet which
dumped California three times in a
row makes the squad a strong one
in all departments.
California will undoubtedly have
another of its good teams, but it can
hardly hope to find a player to fill
the shoes of Hal Eifert, one of the
outstanding basketball players in
Pacific Coast history. With two frosh
squads in two years, however, who
failed to win a single game from
Stanford, the Bears cannot hope to
maintain their top position in Coast
basketball without the aid of some
transfers or a strong bunch of fresh
man next year. —Tremaine
