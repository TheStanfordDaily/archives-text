# Cards Will Leave Saturday Via Train for Eastern Meet
## SEVEN TRACKSTERS IN READINESS FOR IC4-A ON MAY 25 California Sending 5 Men; U.S.C. Still Possibility 
### 
Bickering and reversals are over,
and seven Stanford track men are
settling down to earnest practice
with the goal of regaining the cham
pionship of the Intercollegiate A.A.
A.A. track and field meet in Phila
delphia May 25 and 2(> in sight.
With Board of Athletic Control
action to send a team to the national
meet having received sanction of the
Faculty Athletic Committee Tues
day night, the last barrier to the I rip
was raised.
To Leave Saturday
Coach Dink Templeton and his
group of seven will entrain Satur
day night. In the meantime, Tem
pleton plans to drill his men hard,
with a tapering off workout Satur
day. Stanford will arrive in Phila
delphia in time to take the kinks of
a 3,000-mile trip from bones and
muscles.
Although the Stanford action may
still cause University of Southern
California officials to finance a Tro
jan entry in the meet, no action has
been forthcoming as yet.
Troy recently voted not to partici
pate this year. U.S.C. claims five
victories in the 1.C.4-A., and this
group dethroned Stanford in 1929.
Cardinals have taken second to Dean
Cromwell's aggregation every year
since then.
Californians Enter
California plans to send a five-man
team.
Slinger Dunn showed a return to
his 1933 form this week in practice
by planting the discus out 157 feet,
his best mark of the season. In nor
mal years, this record would win the
national contest.
Others who will make the trip are
Johnny Lyman, weight man; Sam
Klopstock, sophomore hurdler; John
Mottram, javelin tosses; Chuck Nim
tno, middle distance star; A1 Black
man, sprinter and quarter-miler;
and Bud Deacon, pole vaulter.
