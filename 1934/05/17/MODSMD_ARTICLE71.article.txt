# TENNIS TOURNEY MATCHPLAY SET
## 
### 
Stanford's annual mixed doubles
tennis tournament starts tomorrow,
with all first and second round
matches required to be played by
Monday, May 28. This tourney will
be a handicap affair, with the seeded
teams penalized 30 points a game;
so one of the lesser known underdog
pairs may steal the honors.
Two of the four seeded teams drew
byes for the first round, but the other
two must each play tow matches by
May 28. Alice Philp and Ben Dey
will pass by round 1, and then face
Melissa Stearn3 and Milt Friedman
in round 2. Margaret Diedrich and
Chuck Otis got a bye in the first
lound, but will then meet Mary
Mayer and Ted Lilienthal, who also
will pass the first.
Betty Pearce and Bill Seward, an
other seeded pair, will face Marjorie
Wakefield and Burt. Goldstein in
round 1, while Elizabeth Kesting and
Monty Shwayder, the fourth favored
team, are to clash with Glenn Reed
and his partner, also in ihe first
round.
Helen Fulton and Monty Shway
der are the 1933 champions of this
tournament, for which the winning
woman player will receive a new
tennis recquet from a Palo Alto mer
chant.
