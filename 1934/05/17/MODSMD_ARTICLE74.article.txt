# REISNER SHOWS MID-SEASON FORM AS GRID SQUAD HOLDS SCRIMMAGE
## 
### 
I
Johnny Reisner, fleet soph left
half, provided the spark for yester
day's grid workout, shov/ing flashes
of mid-season form in the lew times
he carried the ball.
On the first play after the first
string took the field, Reisner got the
ball from fullback Frank Alustiza,
whipped by the opposing end,
eluded the roving center, and was
off through the secondary with some
iof his old sprinting speed. Defen
sive half Chuck White tried to pull
him down from the rear, but could
not whittle down Reisner's lead.
Subsequent play had the second
string bottling up the offensive with
monotonous regularity, the only
gains being registered by Reisner,
in several swivel-hipped jaunts, and
the strong-darting Alustiza. Alus
tiza was not used a great deal last
year in packing the ball, but this
spring has seen him coming along
as a regular offensive threat.
Three of the 1933 regulars were
gracing the second-team line. Wes
Muller, Bob O'Connor, and Claude
Callaway were those displaced, their
j jobs being at the present usurped
| by Alf Brandin, Woody Adams, and
jEd Lettunich. The three positions
i are by no means cinched. Muller,
! O'Connor, and Callaway are deter
mined to regain their old jobs, and
Brandin, Adams, and Lettunich are
equally determined to stay in there,
so Coach Thornhill can be sure that
no grass will grow between these
six pairs of cleats.
The only other successful scoring
thrust perpetrated by first-stringers
culminated in a pass, snared by
right end Keith Topping over the
goal line, from Alustiza's good right
arm.
Powerful members of the second
string line included Jack Walton,
frosh redheaded flatiron building,
Carlos Monsalve at end, and Wes
Muller. Several minor injuries were
sustained during the fracas, with
Muiler, Topping, and Bob Reynolds
momentarily taking time out.

Bobby Grayson hobbled about
after the line of battle, favoring a
eharley horse that necessitated his
leave from action. Ben Palamoun
tain, big tackle, was also withheld,
as was Dave Bardin, hefty guard.
In a preliminary scrimmage be
tween some of the stronger reserves.
Lee Irelan and Chuck Ledbetter, at
half and full respectively, looked
good in plunges into the line and
drives off tackle.

Johnny Reisner, fleet soph left
half, provided the spark for yester
day's grid workout, shov/ing flashes
of mid-season form in the lew times
he carried the ball.
On the first play after the first
string took the field, Reisner got the
ball from fullback Frank Alustiza,
whipped by the opposing end,
eluded the roving center, and was
off through the secondary with some
iof his old sprinting speed. Defen
sive half Chuck White tried to pull
him down from the rear, but could
not whittle down Reisner's lead.
Subsequent play had the second
string bottling up the offensive with
monotonous regularity, the only
gains being registered by Reisner,
in several swivel-hipped jaunts, and
the strong-darting Alustiza. Alus
tiza was not used a great deal last
year in packing the ball, but this
spring has seen him coming along
as a regular offensive threat.
Three of the 1933 regulars were
gracing the second-team line. Wes
Muller, Bob O'Connor, and Claude
Callaway were those displaced, their
j jobs being at the present usurped
| by Alf Brandin, Woody Adams, and
jEd Lettunich. The three positions
i are by no means cinched. Muller,
! O'Connor, and Callaway are deter
mined to regain their old jobs, and
Brandin, Adams, and Lettunich are
equally determined to stay in there,
so Coach Thornhill can be sure that
no grass will grow between these
six pairs of cleats.
The only other successful scoring
thrust perpetrated by first-stringers
culminated in a pass, snared by
right end Keith Topping over the
goal line, from Alustiza's good right
arm.
Powerful members of the second
string line included Jack Walton,
frosh redheaded flatiron building,
Carlos Monsalve at end, and Wes
Muller. Several minor injuries were
sustained during the fracas, with
Muiler, Topping, and Bob Reynolds
momentarily taking time out.

Bobby Grayson hobbled about
after the line of battle, favoring a
eharley horse that necessitated his
leave from action. Ben Palamoun
tain, big tackle, was also withheld,
as was Dave Bardin, hefty guard.
In a preliminary scrimmage be
tween some of the stronger reserves.
Lee Irelan and Chuck Ledbetter, at
half and full respectively, looked
good in plunges into the line and
drives off tackle.
