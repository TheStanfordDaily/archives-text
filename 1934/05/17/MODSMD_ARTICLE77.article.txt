# TANKMEN WILL BE FAVORITES IN ONE EVENT ON FRIDAY
## Struggle Seen in Other Swimming Match 
### 
Stanford dominance in one event j
and a struggle between Olympic i
Club and Y.M.C.A. swimmers in the '
j other is the present reading of ad- '
vance dope concerning the Pacific |
Association program here Friday i
! evening.
i The two P.A. championship events j
i .scheduled for Eneina pools are the j
; -140-yard breast stroke and the 440- !
I yard free style. Three heats will be 1
! run off in each event, starting at 8 |
i o'clock.
Foster Picked
Captain-elect Bob Foster is heav- j
i ily favored to win the breast stroke j
i for Stanford, with Captain Bob Clark
second choice.
Foster may even set a new Amcri- >
can record for the event. At present I
the* mark is held at 6:1G.6 by John i
Paulsen of U.S.C. He installed the |
| record in the Stanford swimming |
; relays a year ago.
Besides being pressed by Clark, j
! Foster expects competition from j
! Warren Smith of Lakeside. Either
j of these two stars may upset the j
Cardinal captain-to-be.
The Pacific Association record for ,
' the 440-yard event is almost certain i
! to be shattered. This is the first time i
in several years the event has been i
! a part of the program, and nearly all I
I of the 15 entries have outdone the (
mark, now registered at (i minutes 1
i •.
I 8 seconds.
Olds Threat
Buster Olds of the Olympic Club
looms as favorite lor the event. His I
best time is 4:56.2, engineered re-
I cently in practice. An interesting j
duel in this event may develop be
tween Olds and Art Lindegren, great
Y.M.C.A. star. Lindegren is the lead
ing sprinter on the Coast, and has
never competed in a quarter-mile.
After swimming stroke for stroke
with Olds, Lindegren won the 220-
yard free style P.A. title this year.
Olds is rated a better man over the
' longer course.
i Stanford's Jack Kuhn, rapidly de- j
veloping sophomore, Ls a dark horse j
i possibility for a place in the event, i
Kuhn has been in competition less
than six months, but has clipped sec
! onds from hi.s time on nearly every
j appearance.
I The entire program will be run off
| in the 20-yard pool, and fans will
i not have to move to see the diving
| exhibition, slated between the trial
! heats and finals.
Students will be admitted for 25
J cents.

duel in this event may develop be
tween Olds and Art Lindegren, great
Y.M.C.A. star. Lindegren is the lead
ing sprinter on the Coast, and has
never competed in a quarter-mile.
After swimming stroke for stroke
with Olds, Lindegren won the 220-
yard free style P.A. title this year.
Olds is rated a better man over the
' longer course.
i Stanford's Jack Kuhn, rapidly de- j
veloping sophomore, Ls a dark horse j
i possibility for a place in the event, i
Kuhn has been in competition less
than six months, but has clipped sec
! onds from hi.s time on nearly every
j appearance.
I The entire program will be run off
| in the 20-yard pool, and fans will
i not have to move to see the diving
| exhibition, slated between the trial
! heats and finals.
Students will be admitted for 25
J cents.
Stanford dominance in one event j
and a struggle between Olympic i
Club and Y.M.C.A. swimmers in the '
j other is the present reading of ad- '
vance dope concerning the Pacific |
Association program here Friday i
! evening.
i The two P.A. championship events j
i .scheduled for Eneina pools are the j
; -140-yard breast stroke and the 440- !
I yard free style. Three heats will be 1
! run off in each event, starting at 8 |
i o'clock.
Foster Picked
Captain-elect Bob Foster is heav- j
i ily favored to win the breast stroke j
i for Stanford, with Captain Bob Clark
second choice.
Foster may even set a new Amcri- >
can record for the event. At present I
the* mark is held at 6:1G.6 by John i
Paulsen of U.S.C. He installed the |
| record in the Stanford swimming |
; relays a year ago.
Besides being pressed by Clark, j
! Foster expects competition from j
! Warren Smith of Lakeside. Either
j of these two stars may upset the j
Cardinal captain-to-be.
The Pacific Association record for ,
' the 440-yard event is almost certain i
! to be shattered. This is the first time i
in several years the event has been i
! a part of the program, and nearly all I
I of the 15 entries have outdone the (
mark, now registered at (i minutes 1
i •.
I 8 seconds.
Olds Threat
Buster Olds of the Olympic Club
looms as favorite lor the event. His I
best time is 4:56.2, engineered re-
I cently in practice. An interesting j
duel in this event may develop be
tween Olds and Art Lindegren, great
Y.M.C.A. star. Lindegren is the lead
ing sprinter on the Coast, and has
never competed in a quarter-mile.
