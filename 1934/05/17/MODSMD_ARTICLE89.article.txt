# CO-ED MARRIAGES RECORD LOW RATE OF 35% AT U.C.
## Matrimony Is Not Purpose Of College Education 
### 
Despite the prevalent idea that
most women go to college for the
primary purpose of getting married,
information compiled in the office of
the California Alumni Association
tends to disprove this statement.
A questionnaire sent to alumni
and former students of the Univer
sity of California showed that of
9,000 women graduates of that insti
tution, only 3,300, or slightly over
one-third of them, are married. Ac
counting in part for this small num
ber is the fact that only about 10
per cent of the college women marry
before they are 25, while over 50 per
cent do so between the ages of 26
and 36.
Out of the approximately 9,000
women replying to the questions, it
wits revealed that only 95 of them
refused to state their age.
The information collected in this
survey is to be used this summer in
compiling a geographical directory
of alumni of California.
