# INSOUCIANT CARD ROUGHS CALLED "INCENDIARISTS"
## 
### 
In the spring a young man's fancy
ligthly turns to thoughts of incendi
arism, according to Chief R. E. Du
gan of the Stanford Fire Department.
Firing hay stacks is light amuse
ment for insouciant Stanford roughs.
Lest one be inclined to credit nature
with an outburst of cases of sponta
neous combustion, the bottle of gas
oline found in one stack is damning
evidence of human meddling.
Fires in the last week have occur
red near the aviation field, the mil
itary barracks, behind the Toyon
eating clubs, behind tho library, and
one at the stock farm near the golf
links.
We asked Chief Dugan if there
would be any more fires in the near
future. "Sure," he replied, "more
hay fires."
"Are you sure?" we queried. "Re
porters must have facts, not hear
say."
"Well, anyway," he answered, "it's
a pretty good bet!"
