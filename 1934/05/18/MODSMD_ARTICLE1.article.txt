# CARDINAL TEAM ENTRAINS FOR IC4A SATURDAY
## Coach Templeton, Manager Lowry, Seven Stars Will Make Trip LYMAN CINCH IN SHOT Blackman Enters Both 200, 400-Meter Sprint 
### Millard Browne 
Stanford's seven aspirants for the
fourth Cardinal Intercollegiate A.A.
A.A. track and Held championship
will entrain for Philadelphia Sat
urday night, a tired but hopeful
group.
Workouts this week will extend
virtually until train time, with the
seven Indian stars being drilled in
workouts today and tomorrow after
noon.
The group will leave on the Oak
land mole at 6:50 o'clock Saturday
evening and will arrive in Philadel
phia Wednesday morning. This will
give them a chance to have a heavy
practice session to limber up train
weary muscles Wedensday, and a
tapering-ofl workout Thursday be
fore the 1.C.4-A. trials Friday.*
Troy May Go
Although it is believed there is
still a chance that the University of
Southern California will go East, no
action has been forthcoming from
Troy yet. The Trojans, minus any
really outstanding stars, would have
to send a team of 20 or more ath
letes iii order to be in the champion
ship running.
Accompanying the Stanford team
of Sam Klopstock, John Lyman,
John Mottram, A1 Blackman, Chuck
Nimmo, Gordon Dunn, and Bud
Deacon will be Coach Dink Tem
pleton and Manager Sam Lowry.
Klopstock will enter both the
high and low hurdles, and barring
an accident that is so possible to a
hurdler, he will be favored in both
events.
Lyman in Discus
Lyman, easily the outstanding
1.C.4-A. shot-put entry, will also
compete in the discus. He is count
ed on for at least a 150-foot throw,
which should count for several
points. Dunn, provided he contin
ues the improvement he has shown
in the past few weeks, may win the
latter event. The Slinger is also
rated a strong possibility for points
in the shot.
Blackman will run in both the
200- and 400-meter dashes. He may
find the competition in the furlong
too stiff, but he is given a good
chance of placing well in the 400.
U.C.L.A.'s defending quarter - mile
champion, Jimmy LuValle, will not
enter the meet, and another of
Blackman's chief worries, John Mc-
Carthy of S.C., probably will not
compete.
Deacon in Shape
Deacon, recovering from a mid
season slump after nearing a world's
record early in the year in the pole
vault, will be in good condition for
the meet, Templeton predicted last
nigh). He blames Deacon's tempo
rary slump on lack of work in the
past few weeks. The rusty-haired
vaulting star has been sweating con
siderably while rounding into form
this week.
Nimmo is officially entered in
both the 800- and 1500-meters, but
he probably will not run both.
Templeton wiil determine which
race the slim Indian distance man
will run after scanning the entry
lists when he reaches Philadelphia.
The meter system, installed in
1.C.4-A. competition last year for
the first lime, will change the dis
tances of the races slightly, and
many of the winning times will also
be meet records.

nigh). He blames Deacon's tempo
rary slump on lack of work in the
past few weeks. The rusty-haired
vaulting star has been sweating con
siderably while rounding into form
this week.
Nimmo is officially entered in
both the 800- and 1500-meters, but
he probably will not run both.
Templeton wiil determine which
race the slim Indian distance man
will run after scanning the entry
lists when he reaches Philadelphia.
The meter system, installed in
1.C.4-A. competition last year for
the first lime, will change the dis
tances of the races slightly, and
many of the winning times will also
be meet records.
Stanford's seven aspirants for the
fourth Cardinal Intercollegiate A.A.
A.A. track and Held championship
will entrain for Philadelphia Sat
urday night, a tired but hopeful
group.
Workouts this week will extend
virtually until train time, with the
seven Indian stars being drilled in
workouts today and tomorrow after
noon.
The group will leave on the Oak
land mole at 6:50 o'clock Saturday
evening and will arrive in Philadel
phia Wednesday morning. This will
give them a chance to have a heavy
practice session to limber up train
weary muscles Wedensday, and a
tapering-ofl workout Thursday be
fore the 1.C.4-A. trials Friday.*
Troy May Go
Although it is believed there is
still a chance that the University of
Southern California will go East, no
action has been forthcoming from
Troy yet. The Trojans, minus any
really outstanding stars, would have
to send a team of 20 or more ath
letes iii order to be in the champion
ship running.
Accompanying the Stanford team
of Sam Klopstock, John Lyman,
John Mottram, A1 Blackman, Chuck
Nimmo, Gordon Dunn, and Bud
Deacon will be Coach Dink Tem
pleton and Manager Sam Lowry.
Klopstock will enter both the
high and low hurdles, and barring
an accident that is so possible to a
hurdler, he will be favored in both
events.
Lyman in Discus
Lyman, easily the outstanding
1.C.4-A. shot-put entry, will also
compete in the discus. He is count
ed on for at least a 150-foot throw,
which should count for several
points. Dunn, provided he contin
ues the improvement he has shown
in the past few weeks, may win the
latter event. The Slinger is also
rated a strong possibility for points
in the shot.
Blackman will run in both the
200- and 400-meter dashes. He may
find the competition in the furlong
too stiff, but he is given a good
chance of placing well in the 400.
U.C.L.A.'s defending quarter - mile
champion, Jimmy LuValle, will not
enter the meet, and another of
Blackman's chief worries, John Mc-
Carthy of S.C., probably will not
compete.
Deacon in Shape
Deacon, recovering from a mid
season slump after nearing a world's
record early in the year in the pole
vault, will be in good condition for
the meet, Templeton predicted last
nigh). He blames Deacon's tempo
