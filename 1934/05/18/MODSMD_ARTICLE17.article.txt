# Firemen Make Rending Appeal To Goatnappers
## 
### 
This heart - rending appeal
was sent in and the Daily fer
vently hopes that it may aid in
running down the perpetrators
of this heinous erime:
"To the Editor, Sir:
"This is an appeal to the ab
ductors of the Stanford Fire
house goat. Whoever in guilty
of such a lowly deed (the
blackguards) may still have a
spark of kindness left if they
feed it its milk twice daily. Be
sure it's warm. Return it soon,
you vipers!
