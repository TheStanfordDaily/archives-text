# Cathcart Wins Legal Honors In Moot Court
## Judge Jorgensen Decides For Respondent In Appeal Case Losers Present. Arguments In Good Form 
### 
Bob Cathcart with razor-edged
reasoning cut cooly through a tan
gle of legal argument to win the
traditional Law School moot court
trial by defeating Phil and Will Ray
in the finals held last night.
The decision in favor of Cathcart
was handed down by Superior Judge
Henry G. Jorgensen of Monterey
County, who commended both sides
for the presentation of argument and
the structure and persuasive quali
ties of their briefs.
Admitting the difficulty in declar
ing the winner in a moot court, Judge
Jorgensen found the superiority of
Cathcart's brief and his reasoning
more than made up for the advan
tage held by the Ray brothers in the
presentation of the argument and the
skill in answering questions. That
the contest was close was evidenced
by the judge's announcement of the
point score of 6% to 6 I A in favor of
Cathcart.
The case, Anderson vs. the State,
involved a technical point in the law
of evidence. Representing Anderson,
the Ray brothers had appealed the
case from a lower court where An
derson was convicted of involuntary
manslaughter, contending that the
evidence admitted in the trial court
was grounds for reversal because it
abridged constitutional rights.
The tide of battle see-sawed back
and forth as the three law graduates
pounced like eagles upon their op
ponents' points. Cathcart shot
through the maze of reasoning, and
won the case by the contention
backed by cool arguments that the
evidence given by Anderson was not
incriminating and therefore did not
violate constitutional rights.
