# 'On the Rocks' Dramatized in Little Theatre
## James Benet Outstanding As Director, Chief Lead Of Shaw Comedy Packed Theatre Witnesses Initial Performance 
### Virginia Johnson 
The 10-cent royalty fee for George
Bernard Shaw's lastest play, "On
the Rocks," did not decrease the
number of .spectators, quite a few of
whom had to be turned away from
last night's performance in the Lit
tle Theatre. The reading was spon
sored by Sword and Sandals.
To James Benet, who turned in a
very good performance in "Three
Cornered Moon," last Friday night,
go honors for an excellent charac
terization of Sir Arthur Chavender,
prime minister of Great Britain. Be
side his participation in the reading,
Benet was responsible for the direc
tion of the comedy.
Another Shaw Satire
Shaw's newest, which satirizes the
British government from its figure
head of a minister down to the dep
uties of the unemployed, takes place
in the cabinet rooms at 49 Downing
Street. Very pungent stage direc
tions, read by James Sandoe, never
failed to arouse the audience.
Robert Balzar did very well as the
Indian lord, also repeating his suc
cess in "Three Cornered Moon."
Jean Albertson, the wife of the ir
repressible minister; Shelley Smith,
as his daughted, and Neal Berry, his
son, were very good.
Bowman in Role
Fx - itzi-Beth Bowman turned in an
extremely neat perfox-mance as Hil
da, the sympathetic secretary of the
harrassed head of state. William
Gwinn made a convincing ex-soldier
trying to act as head of the police.
Waldo Salt was steadfast in his
determination to remain conserva
tive against the rest of the easily
bribed cabinet. Elizabeth Chapin,
Zimansky, Thomas Sellar,
George Leavens, Dick Dawson,
James Broughton, Robert Brauns,
and Mary Lisles also turned in good
performances.
