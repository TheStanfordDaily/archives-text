# Steelhead Trout Studied At Bean Hoover Ranch
## 
### 
One of the many activities carry
ing Stanford's name to far corners
of the world is ichthyology, or fish
study. Work in this line has been
advanced so far by Stanford men
that the University is now known as
the world's foremost agency for the
study of fishes.
Work in this field was begun by
Dr. David Starr Jordan, who, besides
being Stanford's first president, was
I ihe outstanding ichthyologist of his
time. Since Dr. Jordan's death his
work has been carried on by Dr. C.
H. Gilbert, originator of modern
methods of fishery science; Dr. J. O.
Snyder, former Zoology Department
head and present head of the Bureau
I of Fish Culture, California Division
of Fish and Game; Dr. E. C. Starks,
collector of the world's most val
uable collection of fish skeletons,
and Dr. W. H. Rich.
Dr. Stark's collection is one of the
many interesting things to be seen
in the Museum of Natural History.
Investigations are now being car
ried on at I lie Wuddell Creek Ranch

| of Theodore J. Hoover, dean of tlv
| School of Engineering, relative to the
| biology of the steelhead trout. This
work is under the direction of Dr.
| Snyder.
I Work in the trout investigations
is carried on by virtue of a recent
j grant by the Public Work Adminis
! tration of $20,000 for stream surveys.
These parties of men are to carry
j on the work each party covering one ,
I of three districts, Klamath-Trinity
' National Forest, Sierra National For
! est, and Mono-Inyo National Forest.
| Six Stanford fisheries men are to be
; members of these parties, including
A. C. Taft, Leo Shapovalov, and j
Francis Sumner.
Each group will spend four to five
months gathering data in the field.
Field work will include studies of
i the kinds and abundance of fishes,
amounts of food present in the
.streams, temperatures, chemical an
alysis of the waters, and other chem-
I ical, physical, and biological factors
governing fish life. About $5,000
worth of equipment is to be taken j
along for this survey work.
