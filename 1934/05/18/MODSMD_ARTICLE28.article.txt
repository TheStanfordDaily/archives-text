# M'GRATH WILL RENEW JEWETT MYSTERY PROBE
## San Mateo Sheriff, Seeking Additional Information, To Question Two Women Who Accompanied Peter Jewett Early in Night 
### 
Renewing efforts to solve the mystery of Peter Jewett's death on tho
early morning of April 26, Sheriff James J. McGrath of San Mateo County
yesterday told The Daily that the two Stanford women who had accom
panied the 19-year-old lrcshman student and his companion, Dalton Hen
derson, '.57, to San Francisco on the preceding evening would be questioned

>in Redwood City today.
The co-eds, whose names have not
been made public, will be taken to
Redwood City by Deputy Fred Frehe
of Stanford, Sheriff MeGrath said.
McGrath said that he had written a
letter to Frehe asking that they be
brought up today.
While the women wei-e not present
at the Klondike, Atherton beer
stand, when the scuffle involving
Jewett, Henderson, Frank Oellerich
of Redwood City, and Frank Gold
thwaite, employee of the Klondike,
took place, Sheriff McGrath said that
he thought that the women might
be able to throw some light on events
happening earlier in the evening
which might lead up to the incident
which caused the fatal skull frac
ture.
Henderson, Jewett, and Gold
thwaite are supposed to have parti
cipated in a melee which also in
volved Oellerich, whom Henderson
struck. Immediately, Goldthwaite
ordered Henderson, Jewett and two
other Stanford freshmen, Tom Gree
nough and William Brownell, out of
the establishment, using a stick to
hurry them.
Goldthwaite admitted to Deputy
District Attorney Harold Anderson
of San Mateo County that he used
the stick, but said that he positively
did not touch Jewett with it and that
he lightly lapped Henderson twice,
once on the shoulder and once on
his seat.
Rumors were heard yesterday that
authorities were planning to drop the
case. Sheriff McGrath denied this,
spying that Anderson and he have
been reviewing the transcript of
testimony which the prosecutor has
secured from witnesses.
"As yet," he told The Daily, "the
peculiar nature of the wound has
never been explained. We are try
ing to run down the many theories
advanced as to how it was inflicted.
We will have to have something
more definite than that which we
now possess before any charges can
be filed."
The skull injury, according to the
testimony of Dr. Frederick Proes
cher, Santa Clara County patholo
gist who performed the autopsy,
showed that the bone was not bro
ken, but that two sections of the
skull had been pulled apart by the
blow.

now possess before any charges can
be filed."
The skull injury, according to the
testimony of Dr. Frederick Proes
cher, Santa Clara County patholo
gist who performed the autopsy,
showed that the bone was not bro
ken, but that two sections of the
skull had been pulled apart by the
blow.
Renewing efforts to solve the mystery of Peter Jewett's death on tho
early morning of April 26, Sheriff James J. McGrath of San Mateo County
yesterday told The Daily that the two Stanford women who had accom
panied the 19-year-old lrcshman student and his companion, Dalton Hen
derson, '.57, to San Francisco on the preceding evening would be questioned

>in Redwood City today.
The co-eds, whose names have not
been made public, will be taken to
Redwood City by Deputy Fred Frehe
of Stanford, Sheriff MeGrath said.
McGrath said that he had written a
letter to Frehe asking that they be
brought up today.
While the women wei-e not present
at the Klondike, Atherton beer
stand, when the scuffle involving
Jewett, Henderson, Frank Oellerich
of Redwood City, and Frank Gold
thwaite, employee of the Klondike,
took place, Sheriff McGrath said that
he thought that the women might
be able to throw some light on events
happening earlier in the evening
which might lead up to the incident
which caused the fatal skull frac
ture.
Henderson, Jewett, and Gold
thwaite are supposed to have parti
cipated in a melee which also in
volved Oellerich, whom Henderson
struck. Immediately, Goldthwaite
ordered Henderson, Jewett and two
other Stanford freshmen, Tom Gree
nough and William Brownell, out of
the establishment, using a stick to
hurry them.
Goldthwaite admitted to Deputy
District Attorney Harold Anderson
of San Mateo County that he used
the stick, but said that he positively
did not touch Jewett with it and that
he lightly lapped Henderson twice,
once on the shoulder and once on
his seat.
Rumors were heard yesterday that
authorities were planning to drop the
case. Sheriff McGrath denied this,
spying that Anderson and he have
been reviewing the transcript of
testimony which the prosecutor has
secured from witnesses.
"As yet," he told The Daily, "the
peculiar nature of the wound has
never been explained. We are try
ing to run down the many theories
advanced as to how it was inflicted.
We will have to have something
more definite than that which we
now possess before any charges can
be filed."
