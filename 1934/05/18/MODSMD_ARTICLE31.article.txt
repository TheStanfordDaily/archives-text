Drastic changes, long overdue, should he made inline

diatelv in the fixing of proper coinpensaiton lor leading;
student body positions. This should he done by the Con-i
slitutional Revision Committee for submission to the Ex
ecutive Committee next Tuesday night.

In the first place, the president of the Associated Stu-i
dents draws no salary today, and spends many required]
hours both in and out of his office in the interests of the j
A.S.S.I', and the I niversily. The student manager, on |
the other hand, draws <fBO on I Ik* first of each month and '
spends very little more time than does his head man.
An A.S.S.I'. president's salary should, perhaps, not be;
very large. At the same lime, the position should definitely
carry a salary and stipulated ollice hours with it. Today,'
while the man is not required to maintain any regular j
ollice hours, he must spend a good deal of his own time i
without any recompense. Southern California's student j
body president receives *If>o monthly, according.to re
ports.
Looking further into the field of salaried individuals, j
the dramatics manager is found to be eligible for $(>0 per
mouth for 11 months of the year, while a Daily editor who j
averages nearly six hours each day attending to his task!
of providing a morning paper for the campus receives $r>o;
per month for only three and a half months.
The editor and business manager of the Quad receive
*"><> each month, the 1 Concert Series manager if 10, and the'
Daily business manager $75.
A majority of all the above men stand a chance of j
earning some additional money on a percentage basis.!
The Dmi.y managing editor, who spends many hours each
day at work, receives no salary whatsoever, although lie'
stands a chance (in good years) of getting a 7'j per cent
share of profits.

The Daily looks at the whole situation objectively and'
hopes that before Tuesday the Revision Committee will
study the above-mentioned figures, balance them justly,;
and come forth with a new set which will be fair to all
concerned.
