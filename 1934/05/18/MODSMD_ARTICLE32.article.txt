## Silverites Win the First Round 
### CROMPTON BANCS Jr 
During the past few weeks the
silver forces in Congress have been
getting stronger and stronger. This
happened because business was
showing signs of slowing up. This
was something nobody wanted to
have happen.
Besides, many farmers are holler
ing for something to raise the price
of their products. As the prices of
many things such as wheat and cot
ton are fixed by the world market
not. the U.S.—the world prices have
to be raised. One way to do this is
to raise the price of silver.
SILVER WILL BE
ONE-FOURTH ALL MONEY
Yesterday the President compro
mised with the powerful Senate sil
ver bloc. Within two days he will
; end a message to Congress favoring
a 25 per cent silver and 75 per cent
standard instead of the present
100 per cent gold standard.
As in last year's inflationary laws,
F.R. sow Congress playing with a
dangerous toy; so he asked them to
give it to papa and let him use it.
The President can buy and sell sil
ver whenever and wherever he
wants; he can also seize all the
silver now hoarded in the U.S. and
pay not more than 50 cents an ounce
for it.
As silver is now 45 cents, this will
take most of the profit out of hoard

! ing it. The big silver hoarders have
[ now gotten what they thought they
wanted. But they can't have their
cake and eat it too.
WILL PROBABLY
MEAN SOME INFLATION
Naturally the President does not
HAVE to do all these things; he
can do any or all of them, or none
of them—as he wishes. In this way 1
the silver power has been put into
the safest possible hands.
This does not mean that there will
be no inflation. Just now F.R.'s idea
is to buy silver at the market price ,
(45-50 cents) until he has enough of j
it (re-valued at $1.29 an ounce) I
to equal one-third the value of the !
gold behind our money. Then a j
dollar bill will be issued for each 1
ounce of silver owned by the U.S.
Because there would be more
money in circulation, the chances
are that it would raise prices and
help business—at least for a while.
Besides, silver would have a steady
i price on the world market and thus
make possible steadier if not slightly
higher prices for American farm j
products such as cotton and wheat. l
F.R.'s silver move may fail to do
these things. If it does it will have
given business a shot in the arm—
v/hich was after all the main idea.
II the plan does work, it can do a
lot of good without doing any harm,
i but only if Congress keeps out of it.

dangerous toy; so he asked them to
give it to papa and let him use it.
The President can buy and sell sil
ver whenever and wherever he
wants; he can also seize all the
silver now hoarded in the U.S. and
pay not more than 50 cents an ounce
for it.
As silver is now 45 cents, this will
take most of the profit out of hoard

! ing it. The big silver hoarders have
[ now gotten what they thought they
wanted. But they can't have their
cake and eat it too.
WILL PROBABLY
MEAN SOME INFLATION
Naturally the President does not
HAVE to do all these things; he
can do any or all of them, or none
of them—as he wishes. In this way 1
the silver power has been put into
the safest possible hands.
This does not mean that there will
be no inflation. Just now F.R.'s idea
is to buy silver at the market price ,
(45-50 cents) until he has enough of j
it (re-valued at $1.29 an ounce) I
to equal one-third the value of the !
gold behind our money. Then a j
dollar bill will be issued for each 1
ounce of silver owned by the U.S.
Because there would be more
money in circulation, the chances
are that it would raise prices and
help business—at least for a while.
Besides, silver would have a steady
i price on the world market and thus
make possible steadier if not slightly
higher prices for American farm j
products such as cotton and wheat. l
F.R.'s silver move may fail to do
these things. If it does it will have
given business a shot in the arm—
v/hich was after all the main idea.
II the plan does work, it can do a
lot of good without doing any harm,
i but only if Congress keeps out of it.
During the past few weeks the
silver forces in Congress have been
getting stronger and stronger. This
happened because business was
showing signs of slowing up. This
was something nobody wanted to
have happen.
Besides, many farmers are holler
ing for something to raise the price
of their products. As the prices of
many things such as wheat and cot
ton are fixed by the world market
not. the U.S.—the world prices have
to be raised. One way to do this is
to raise the price of silver.
SILVER WILL BE
ONE-FOURTH ALL MONEY
Yesterday the President compro

a 25 per cent silver and 75 per cent
standard instead of the present
100 per cent gold standard.

F.R. sow Congress playing with a
