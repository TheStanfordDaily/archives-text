LOOKING FOR TROUBLE
| (20th Century)
At Blanco's Cinema Theatre, Moun
tain View
During recent months there has
been a decided attempt on the part
of the movie bosses to build up
j Spencer Tracy's drawing power. He
j has been starred in plays that, while
perhaps not so fine as regards tech
nicalities, do provide a good eve
ning's entertainment. "Lookinf lor
Trouble" is no exception, and is an
interesting, well-directed opus.
The cast, which includes Jack
Oakie, Arline Judge, and Constance
Cummings, takes the roles With a
pleasing naturalness, though in this
respect it must be admitted that the
demands of the picture are not suf
ficient to overtax its collective abili
ties.
Accompanying the main feature is
"Oliver the Eighth," a Laurel and
j Hardy comedy, which, amazing
enough, lacks most of the inane
I stunts in which this pair usually in
j dulge. Even if you dislike Laurel
I and his chubby pal, you will prob
ably like this picture, one of the
most amusing they have produced.

THE MYSTERY OF MR. X (MGM)
At the Mountain View Theatre
When it comes to murder myste
ries, there are simply no standards
except enjoyment—in which case
the present film rates high.
Relying considerably on the long
arm of coincidence, "Mr. X" tells the
story of a maniac who has a quaint
penchant for killing of? policemen,
to the great discomfort of Mr. Mont
gomery, who is a perfectly normal I
and well-meaning jewel thief. Ul- ;
timately, though he is suspected of j
the murders, he is exonerated, and j
manages to avoid condemnation for !
the jewel theft; incidentally, he wins j
the affections of the daughter of the !
chief of police and all is well.
The chief merit of the picture lies ,
in the excitement of the incidents |
and the manner in which interest is
sustained. There are a number of j
excellent moments, particularly that
in which Lewis Stone almost catches I
Montgomery with the diamond. In -
the finish, of course, there is a grand |
chase and fisticuffs between the star '
and the maniac.
Montgomery gives an intelligent
performance, without too much of i
bis brecziness and just enough gaiety, j
Of the support, Ralph Forbes is!
rather silly, Elizabeth Allan rather j
unattractive, and Lewis Stone and |
Henry Stephenson both splendid. |

the jewel theft; incidentally, he wins j
the affections of the daughter of the !
chief of police and all is well.
The chief merit of the picture lies ,
in the excitement of the incidents |
and the manner in which interest is
sustained. There are a number of j
excellent moments, particularly that
in which Lewis Stone almost catches I
Montgomery with the diamond. In -
the finish, of course, there is a grand |
chase and fisticuffs between the star '
and the maniac.
Montgomery gives an intelligent
performance, without too much of i
bis brecziness and just enough gaiety, j
Of the support, Ralph Forbes is!
rather silly, Elizabeth Allan rather j
unattractive, and Lewis Stone and |
Henry Stephenson both splendid. |

LOOKING FOR TROUBLE
| (20th Century)
At Blanco's Cinema Theatre, Moun
tain View
During recent months there has
been a decided attempt on the part
of the movie bosses to build up
j Spencer Tracy's drawing power. He
j has been starred in plays that, while
perhaps not so fine as regards tech
nicalities, do provide a good eve
ning's entertainment. "Lookinf lor
Trouble" is no exception, and is an
interesting, well-directed opus.
The cast, which includes Jack
Oakie, Arline Judge, and Constance
Cummings, takes the roles With a
pleasing naturalness, though in this
respect it must be admitted that the
demands of the picture are not suf
ficient to overtax its collective abili
ties.
Accompanying the main feature is
"Oliver the Eighth," a Laurel and
j Hardy comedy, which, amazing
enough, lacks most of the inane
I stunts in which this pair usually in
j dulge. Even if you dislike Laurel
I and his chubby pal, you will prob
ably like this picture, one of the
most amusing they have produced.

THE MYSTERY OF MR. X (MGM)
At the Mountain View Theatre
When it comes to murder myste
ries, there are simply no standards
except enjoyment—in which case
the present film rates high.
Relying considerably on the long
arm of coincidence, "Mr. X" tells the
story of a maniac who has a quaint
penchant for killing of? policemen,
to the great discomfort of Mr. Mont
gomery, who is a perfectly normal I
and well-meaning jewel thief. Ul- ;
timately, though he is suspected of j
the murders, he is exonerated, and j
manages to avoid condemnation for !
the jewel theft; incidentally, he wins j
the affections of the daughter of the !
chief of police and all is well.
