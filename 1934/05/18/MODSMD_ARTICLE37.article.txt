' The Editor, Sir:
At this time many sophomores
j and juniors are planning their com-
I ing year's work at Stanford. In this
j connection 1 would like to call at
tention to some of the "benefits which
j can be derived from taking one's
work under the guidance of the
l Committee on Independent Study,
[ as -I have now completed my yearns
I work on this plan.
In the first place, the Independent
j Study plan frees the student from
j classroom routine, putting him upon
| his initiative and responsibility. One
| oral examination replaces innumer
j able written ones, and one gains a
; deeper grasp of the subject than a
j mere classroom surface survey,
j Looking over my independent
j study work, I find I have developed
i improved study habits, and had a
much closer contact with library
sources and materials. One obtains
training in the scientific method,
and has the benefit of professorial
! guidance.
Auditing, of course, and study of
French and German can be made
to fit into this plan if the student so
desires. One also obtains valuable
training in composition and analysis.
The advantages of concentration are
all on the side of the independent
study student.
Finally. I wish to thank Professor
and Mrs. H. McD. Clokie on behalf
of the independent study students
1 for the many happy social hours we
have had at their home.
Sincerely yours,
â€”Cedric Larson
