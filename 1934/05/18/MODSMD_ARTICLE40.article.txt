# BULL SESSION
## COMMUNISM, FASCISM, MASOCHISM 
### 
"In Europe and even the Orient,
students get out in the streets and
J battle like all hell for Communism,
i Fascism, and Masochism "
I Ever since Monday's "Razz Edition"'
| we have been worried over Maso
' chism. Communism and Fascism
j have become fairly glib and unin
| telligible. But Masochism is queer,
j so queer that small Websters are
j baffled and silent.
But Masochism might, be anything
| (although it isn't) and it would mean
i just as little to most everyone as
Communism, Fascism, or American
j ism. American students would no
| more think of fighting for Masochism
lor Americanism, than they would
I think of fighting for anything. When
! American students or Stanford stu-
I dents do begin fighting, they will
fight because they have been told to
j fight—and not because of mental de
| votion to Masochism, Americanism
j or anything j'lse.
Personally, we do not recommend
j getting "out in the streets and bat
i tling like hell for Communism, Fas
! cism, Masochism," or Americanism.
! We do believe that it is the duty of

| everyone in a university to at least
do some thinking on Communism,
Fascism, Masochism, and American
ism, and almost any "ism." If the
; university does not train students
for action, it should at least train
them for contemplative, and not
vegetative inaction.
The lecturer was speaking of a
Communist who had been beaten up
by policemen. A young lady in the
back of the class piped out in a voica,
unabashed and falsetto, "What was
he fighting for?" That, perhaps, is
1 the proper "scientific attitude": to
find the "why" in everything. Re
gardless of the merits of any doc
! trine, any sweet young thing who
I has been interred in a university for
i over a year—and still dtfcs not know
why Communists fight, is obviously
out-of-place in a university. Com
! munism, broiled, baked, and roasted,
has been a major reason for the
black ink on newspaper front pages
for years now; anyone—half-awake
—has seen it.
Mr. Hearst and a few others are
very much afraid that the universi-
I ties are turning out a bunch of
i "youngsters" who will overturn the
world. Mr. Hearst has the thing ex
actly reversed. Caught in the sweet
coma of indifference, college "ycung
| sters" will not move fast enough to
counteract the rotation of the earth.
They will be overturned, perhaps
awakened. —Dave MellinkofT
