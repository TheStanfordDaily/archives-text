# One Kidnaped, Six Injured in Bay Dock Riot
## Eastern Official Arrives, May Settle Dispute 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 17
Two violent outbreaks, in one of
which six persons were reported
hurt and one kidnaped, marked the
longshoremen's strike today just
after the arrival here of Edward F.
McGrady, assistant secretary of la
bor, to begin conferences designed
to end the Coast-wide walkout
which has tied up shipping in several
ports since May 9.
A furious encounter took place in
Oakland as 400 men, characterized
by authorities as longshore workers,
broke through police lines at the
municipal pier, overran a string of
gondola cars and boarded the Japa
nese freighter Oregon Maru which
was being loaded with scrap iron.
Six were injured, one seriously, as
police said, the longshoremen
grabbed pieces of scrap iron and sent
it in a barrage against the 75 men
loading the vessel.
As police reserves rushed up the
strikers retreated. Officers said they
used about 75 automobiles in the re
treat, and took Thomas F. Laughlin
of San Francisco, who had been
working on the ship, with them.
During the melee one of the work
ers on the freighter was thrown into
the bay and alleged strikers sent a
shower of scrap iron after him. He
was rescued. No arrests were made
as the result of the encounter.
Just previously, two automobile
buses carrying non-union workers
to the waterfront in Alameda were
attacked. Officers said a dozen au
tomobiles of longshoremen pui'sucd
the stages through the streets, cast
ing stone at the non-union workers.
None was reported hurt.
McGrady dashed here by airplane
from Washington because of the
growing seriousness of the situation
and held hurried conferences imme
diately after his arrival.
McGrady and members of Presi
dent Roosevelt's Board of Mediation
summoned representatives of the In
ternational Longshoremen's Associa
tion and other striking workers and
said they felt definite progress had
been.made toward settling the dis
pute.
