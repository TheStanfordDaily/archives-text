# ENCINA INFORMAL BIDS HIT NEW LOW
## 
### 
Encina Club's spring informal will
hit a new low in a social season full
of "unusually low prices" next Fri
day night in the Encina ballroom,
with bids now selling at the old
Union for $1.50 per couple.
Committeemen Rex Hardy, Bob
Hoover, and Miguel Gonzalez want
to emphasize the fact, however, that
a reduction in the bid cost does not
mean a lowering of the class that
has characterized Encina Club offer
ings of past years. The committee
expects an increase in the total
number of bids sold to make up for
the cut price of the individual bids.
A full Ernie Heckscher orchestra,
the spring hit in campus music, dec
orations by Milo Talley, noted most
for his realistic setting for the Toyon
informal of last March, and refresh
ments handled by Wes Muller com
prise a few of the plans which
promise a smash wind-up to the
campus social season.
