# Texas U. Seeks to Meet Prominent Football Team
## 
### 
Trying to find new fields to con
quer, the University of Texas is
looking for a school "of outstand
ing significance" to sign up on their
football schedule of 1936.
The members of the Athletic
Council wish to celebrate the Texas
Centennial with a good team, such
as Nebraska, and have recommend
ed that the faculty waive the regu
lations prohibiting the playing of
football after Thanksgiving, in order
that they might have a chance with
such teams as otherwise have full
schedules up to November.
