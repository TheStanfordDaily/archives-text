Wanton destroyers of Stanford's
precious wheat were at last appre
hended yesterday morning when the
University Fire Department, in an
swer to an untraced call from Se
quoia Hall, caught two Sequoia lads
—Richard Ealon and Bill Nelson—
red-handed while laying waste to
the uncut wheat crop in Sequoia's
back yard.
Booming down upon the unsus
pecting pair, the firemen found them
looking on blandly while flames ate
at the wheat. Caught in the act,
Eaton and Nelson pointed to the two
buckets of water in their hands as
evidence of good intentions, claim
ing that they were burning the
wheat to eliminate a fire hazard.
Convinced, Stanford's good-hearted
firemen finished the wheat-burning
with water truck and artificial ex
tinguishers to keep the fire from
spreading to Sequoia's green hedges;
but Eaton and Nelson are still look
ing for the gentleman who turned
in the fire-alarm.
