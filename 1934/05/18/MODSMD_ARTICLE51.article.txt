# Terman Talks On Psychology To Honor Club
## Pi Sigma Alpha Fraternity Hears of Politics And Mental Ability New Initiates Announced At Last Night's Meet 
### 
Speaking before the members of
Pi Sigma Alpha, national Political
Science honor society, in the base
ment of the Women's Clubhouse last
evening, Professor Lewis M. Tci
man, head of the Department of
Psychology, pointed out the rela
tionship between psychology and
politics.
"Laws are experiments in human
behavior. Psychology has much to
gain from a study of their reactions
on the people," affirmed Terman,
who showed that pathological causes
lie at the bottom of most of the ac
tions of governments.
Effect of Instincts
Taking up the problem of the ef
fect of instincts on human behavior,
Terman stated that although one
cannot say either that there are no
human instincts, or that instincts
account for all of behavior, it is
absurd to explain institutions by
human instincts.
He reminded the audience that
the same institutions such as those
of marriage and property, which are
regarded as existent because of a
definite human tendency along their
lines, take such varied forms in dif
ferent peoples that no instinct or
group of instincts could possibly ac
count for them.
Terman pointed out that there is
no relationship between personality
or mental attitude and mental abil
ity. While the former is influenced
almost wholly by environment, the
latter is, he believes, influenced by
it only in a very small degree.
Childhood Environment
Giving interesting sidelights on
the characters of well-known per
sons, Terman showed how their
traits, personalities, and political
opinions could be traced to child
hood environmental causes. Taking,
for example, lawless persons, he has
traced hteir lawlessness to a disre
spect or dislike of cruel parental
authority.
He went on to show that although
there is no noticeable mental differ
ence between European and Asiatic
races, he finds Ihe American Indian
and the Negro of a definitely lower
mental capacity.
As an enlightening comment on
the average intelligence of the
average intelligence of the American
citizen, Terman told of working with
a Stanford student who, of very
much lower intelligence than any-
one else in the University, was only
slightly less capable than the aver-
age.

Last night's meeting of Pi Sigma
Alpha also completed Ihe initiation
of several new members. Those in-
itiated were: Thomas Hitch, C. C.
Chang, Louise Hudson, Oliver Fen-
stermacher, Jane Hillebrand, H. G.
