### Jack Newman 
With a sub par round of 70
strokes, Jack Hoerner won his right
to play in the finals of the all-Uni
versity golf tournament from Dick >
Giddings by a four and two margin :
in a match on the Stanfotd course I
yesterday afternoon.
This will be the second consecu- :
tive year that Hoerner has been a
finalist in the all-University event. I
Last year he won his way into the
finals only to be defeated by Law- I
son Little in the 36-hole final match.
Hoerner Finishes Strong
Giddings went to the tenth hole !
with a lead of one hole and a medal
score of 37 to Hoerner's 38. From
there in Hoerner unleashed a bar- '
rage of birdies that shook Giddings' 1
lead. He scored five birdies on the !
last nine for a 32 and a match total j
oi 70. Giddings finished with a 38 j
on the last nine holes which gave
him a 75 for the match.
This was the second match be
tween Giddings and Hoerner this
year and evens up the contest to
dcite. In the first match that was
played, Giddings successfully un
seated Hoerner when he was rest
ing after being defeated by Don ]
Edwards in the match for first lad
der position. Hoerner ended the
season one notch below Giddings on
the ladder.
Finals Saturday
Saturday Hoerner will meet the j
winner of the Hugh Mellon-Stew j
Hawley match in the championship
which will be played over the 36-
hole route.
Who will be the winner of the re
maining semi-final match is doubt
ful but the critics pick Hawley. .
Mellon is credited with having more
fight and Hawley with the greater i
of experience. Mellon started j
in the eleventh ladder position at .
the beginning of the current season
and went through consecutive
matches to the sixth position on the
ladder.
Putting (o Decide
Lawson Little won the title last j
year in the 36-hole match by a six
and five margin. His longer irons
subdued Hoerner's long drives.
In the final match putting will i
determine the winner. Hoerner's j
game goes with his putting. When I
he fell before Giddings it was three
putt greens that caused his down
fall. His victory over the same yes
terday was caused by superior put
ting. Hoerner has a long game that
is hard to match on the Stanford
course.
