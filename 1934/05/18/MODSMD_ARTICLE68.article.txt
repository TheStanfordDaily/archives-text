# POLOISTS MEET MILITARY ACADEMY HERE SATURDAY
## 
### 
| Local polo enthusiasts will have !
their last opportunity to witness a
! game on the campus this season 1
j when Indian riders meet the Black
i Fox Military Academy four on the
I highway field at 2:30 o'clock tomor
: row.
A new combination will be sent
[against the highly rated prep .school
! mallet wielders, according to Cap- '
j tain Richard Gordan's recently an
! nounced plans, which give an op
; portunity for second team men to get
'some real competition.
j In place of Bob Fullerton and Russ
Rasmussen, Gordan has decided to
1 use Bill Enemark and Jim Hender-
I son, riding at positions one and four,
| respectively. He has moved Luppe
j Luppen to number two, a position he
has never played before, and has put
j Bill Rogers at three.
i The fact that these four have never
i played together before makes it dif
j lieu It to predict what the outcome of
; tomorrow's tilt will be, although the
j Indians should come out on top, hav
i ing beaten the best collegiate and
I country club teams on the Coa.st this
l
; year.
But the Black Fox boys who ar
rive from Los Angeles tonight bring
! with them a reputation any college
| team would be glad to have, in spite
Jof the fact that they are only of
i high-school age.
j Stanford's first string met them
| and defeated them 9 to 6 during
l spring vacation, but had a much
I harder time doing it than they did
i the Trojan four, whom they downed
1 14 to 8, and then again last week on
] the campus, 11 to 5.
Captain Gordan has had little

trouble finding good men to put into I
games this year. In fact, so many
have developed under his tutelage
that his greatest worry has been to
find enough games and good enough
competition to keep them all busy.
Cal Emeis and Frank Burns will
both be on hand as substitutes to
morrow, and the chance.; are that ii
the going gets easy, Captain Gordan
will play his entire second team, who
have shown their capabilities already
this season by beating Oregon State
and U.S.C. by decisive scores.
A possible game at Monterey is all
that remains for the poloists after to
morrow, the game at Golden Gate
Park in San Francisco having been
canceled.
Admission will be free tomorrow
and the public is invited.
