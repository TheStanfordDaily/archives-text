# Palo Alto Police Radio Operating Since March
## 
### 
I "Car number one: go to ; see
about, man lying in hedge." So
1 worded was a message recently sent
j out, from KGHK, the Stanford-built
radio station of the Palo Alto police
department.
Although not instrumental in cap
turing a Dillinger, foiling a bank
robbery, or apprehending a kidnaper,
I the station, in operation since March
I 13, has already proved itself a suc
: cess.
Four cities make use of the sys
tem, with 10 police and two fire cars
J equipped to receive the messages.
Palo Alto has three police patrol cars
j and one fire car, Stanford has two
police cars, Menlo's fire chief has a
set in his car, and Atherton and Red
wood City have three and two police
cars, respectively. In addition, there
is a receiver tuned to 1674 kilocycles,
the station's frequency, in the Sari
Carlos police office.
Not the least of the features of the
Palo Alto police radio station is that
it enjoys the probably unique dis
tinction of having a woman operator.
Miss Kay Webber is the charming
young lady who answers the switch
board and i mis the radio station

' from 8 o'clock in the morning to 4
o'clock in the afternoon.
Neither job, it mast be admitted, is
very exhausting. Traffic on the air
averages about 12 calls per day,
while the maximum recorded in one |
day so far has been 21. In addition i
to these, the station sends out hourly
time checks, so that cruising cars [
may be sure that nothing is amiss'
with either their receivers or the
transmitter. Failure to receive these j
hourly time checks would cause the
officers in the car to phone the sta
tion.
Although not, as in the New York
City system, to foil listening crimi
nals, a code of signals does exist, i
Code messages are provided with
mean, when translated, "see about J
J fight.," "investigate wild party," and
similar offenses. Of course it would
i never do to publicly admit the exis- I
tence of such heinous crimes in Palo '
, Alto, hence the code.
Use of the station is increasing I
i daily. The sheriff's office is making
use of it to broadcast descriptions of I
| wanted people, and it has proved e.s- :
I pocially valuable in speeding ve
i spouse to tlu' many recent fires.

Although not instrumental in cap
turing a Dillinger, foiling a bank
robbery, or apprehending a kidnaper,
I the station, in operation since March
I 13, has already proved itself a suc
: cess.
Four cities make use of the sys
tem, with 10 police and two fire cars
J equipped to receive the messages.
Palo Alto has three police patrol cars
j and one fire car, Stanford has two
police cars, Menlo's fire chief has a
set in his car, and Atherton and Red
wood City have three and two police
cars, respectively. In addition, there
is a receiver tuned to 1674 kilocycles,
the station's frequency, in the Sari
Carlos police office.
Not the least of the features of the
Palo Alto police radio station is that
it enjoys the probably unique dis
tinction of having a woman operator.
Miss Kay Webber is the charming
young lady who answers the switch
board and i mis the radio station

' from 8 o'clock in the morning to 4
o'clock in the afternoon.
Neither job, it mast be admitted, is
very exhausting. Traffic on the air
averages about 12 calls per day,
while the maximum recorded in one |
day so far has been 21. In addition i
to these, the station sends out hourly
time checks, so that cruising cars [
may be sure that nothing is amiss'
with either their receivers or the
transmitter. Failure to receive these j
hourly time checks would cause the
officers in the car to phone the sta
tion.
Although not, as in the New York
City system, to foil listening crimi
nals, a code of signals does exist, i
Code messages are provided with
mean, when translated, "see about J
J fight.," "investigate wild party," and
similar offenses. Of course it would
i never do to publicly admit the exis- I
tence of such heinous crimes in Palo '
, Alto, hence the code.
Use of the station is increasing I
i daily. The sheriff's office is making
use of it to broadcast descriptions of I
| wanted people, and it has proved e.s- :
I pocially valuable in speeding ve
i spouse to tlu' many recent fires.
I "Car number one: go to ; see
about, man lying in hedge." So
1 worded was a message recently sent
j out, from KGHK, the Stanford-built
radio station of the Palo Alto police
department.
