GRIPES AT FACULTY
ATHLETIC GROUP
Plenty of gripes have been heard
since the Faculty Athletic Commit
tee decided that no more Stanford
track teams would be allowed to en
ter the 1.C.4-A meets after this year,
and some of the loudest have come
from sports critics on San Francisco
newspapers.
One of the biggest appeared yes
terday morning in a bay city sports
page and criticized the P"aculty Ath
letic Committee for its stand in
withdrawing from the 1.C.4-A on the
grounds that the meet was "not
Iruly representative." It may be true
that the Faculty Committee stepped
out of bounds in giving that as its
reason since the group is an acade
mic one, not a schedule-making
body, and it's undoubtedly unfortu
nate that the announcement came
when it did. It will put Stanford's
seven representatives this year in an
awkward position when they arrive
in Philadelphia, but the fact still re
mains that their statement is a cor
rect one—that the 1.C.4-A meets are
not truly national in scope. And
also, if Stanford is to withdraw from
the meets, it is better to make the
announcement in plenty of time to
avoid criticism on the grounds of
"running out."
1.C.4-A. REALLY
EASTERN MEET
For years the 1.C.4-A. meet has
been looked on as the outstanding
one in the country and the winner
of it was considered the national
champion. Undoubtedly it hits more
tradition back of it than its rival, the
N.C.A.A., but a perusal of figures
will definitely show that the 1.C.4-A.
group is overwhelmingly Eastern.
There are 43 colleges listed as
members of the I.C.A.A.A.A. Of
these, 37 are Eastern, two (Michigan
and Michigan State) are of the Mid-
West, and the four big California
colleges represent the Far West.
The first 1.C.4-A. meeting was held
in 1876, but it was not until 1885
that the first name not strictly East
ern was found in the summaries
when Michigan appeared. Ten years
later lowa's name was found in the
summaries and in 1900 the first Pa
cific Coast school made a showing
when California was an entrant.
WESTERN SCHOOLS
HAVE "MADE" GOOD
Of late years the Pacific Coast
colleges have dominated the meets
and literally "made" them as far as
any great interest outside of the
East is concerned. In the last 13
years California has won the title
three times, Stanford three times,
and U.S.C. six, the East interrupting
the succession of Western victories
but once in that time with a Yale
victory in 1924.
Never has the West been repre
sented by more than three universi
ties, often by only two, while seldom
more than one of the two Mid-West
ern schools enters. Michigan has
preferred the N.C.A.A. meet for sev
eral years.
Despite this fact, the West has
managed to take a lion's share of the
points in the last decade. As an ex
ample, last year U.S.C. took first,
Stanford second, with U.C.L.A. rep
resented by only two men just a few
places back, which gave the Pacific-
Coast athletes a total of 97 points
out of a possible 225.
WEST SHOWS
BETTER PERFORMANCES
The N.C.A.A. is a much more rep
resentative meet, admitting colleges
from all over the country. Obser
vation points to the fact that track
supremacy has moved westward and
most of the outstanding perform
ances are being made in the Mid-
West, South, or on the Coast where
conditions are favorable to a longer
training period. The East has turned
out some great stars in recent years,
including Bonthron of Princeton,
Brown of Yale, Hallowell of Har

vard, Can* of Pennsylvania, and sev
eral others, but these men are ex
ceptions rather than the rule and a
comparison of times and distances
between Eastern and Western meets
will show a great advantage on the
side of the later.
Such a comparison was made fol
lowing the Penn relays, Drake re
lays, and Fresno relays, meets held
in three different sections of the
country, and it was found that the
latter two were well ahead of the
Eastern performances. Hornbostel
of Indiana was responsible for the
time in the mile at the Penn relays
which was one of the few events in
which the Eastern meet excelled.

Women's Tennis
Women tennis stars will exhibit
their prowess with (ho men as 23
teams — and probably more — sally
into the spring mixed doubles tennis
tournatnent which starts Friday with
single elimination. A variety of
handicaps and "dark horses" make a
strange mixture in Ihe dope bucket,
so that almost anything has a fair
chance to happen.
FAVORED
TO WIN
Alice Philp, who has just climbed
to the third rung of the tennis lad
der by defeating Betty Pearce, is
teamed with Ben Dey, first in frosh
tennis, and co-champion with Gene
Mako in the national junior doubles.
They make up the favored team.
Seeded are Margaret Diedrich,
second on the ladder, and Chuck
Otis, varsity captain. They looked
strong, indeed, in their practice game
with Elizabeth Kesting and Monty
Schwayder, varsity doubles man.
Kesting heads the women's tennis
ladder, and ranks first in national
doubles with Helen Fulton, who
helped Schwayder win the mixed
doubles cup last year.
CRYSTAL
GAZING
Betty Pearce, and Bill Seward,
frosh captain, seeded fourth, are an
exceptional pair, and with the three
teams above have a -30 handicap.
Pearce and Seward meet Marjorie
Wakefield and Burt Goldstein in the
first round, and it looks as though,
what with the latter's handicap boost
of plus 15, that an upset may occur.
Right next to the seeded players
are Dot Ann Jackson, one of the
best, playing with Glenn Reed, grad
and former varsity member, with a
handicap of 15 and 3-6, dangerous
competition.
SOME VERY
DARK HORSES
Then there are the dark horses
that add to the interest of races and
tournaments. Three teams may be
classed: Mary Mayer and Ted Lilien
thal, who made his varsity letter this
year; Virginia Swafford and A1 Bo
gan, varsity doubles star; and Doris
Clayburgh with Bob Lilienthal.

strong, indeed, in their practice game

GRIPES AT FACULTY
ATHLETIC GROUP
Plenty of gripes have been heard
since the Faculty Athletic Commit
tee decided that no more Stanford
track teams would be allowed to en
ter the 1.C.4-A meets after this year,
and some of the loudest have come
from sports critics on San Francisco
newspapers.
One of the biggest appeared yes
terday morning in a bay city sports
page and criticized the P"aculty Ath
letic Committee for its stand in
withdrawing from the 1.C.4-A on the
grounds that the meet was "not
Iruly representative." It may be true
that the Faculty Committee stepped
out of bounds in giving that as its
reason since the group is an acade
mic one, not a schedule-making
body, and it's undoubtedly unfortu
nate that the announcement came
when it did. It will put Stanford's
seven representatives this year in an
awkward position when they arrive
in Philadelphia, but the fact still re
mains that their statement is a cor
rect one—that the 1.C.4-A meets are
not truly national in scope. And
also, if Stanford is to withdraw from
the meets, it is better to make the
announcement in plenty of time to
avoid criticism on the grounds of
"running out."
1.C.4-A. REALLY
EASTERN MEET
For years the 1.C.4-A. meet has
been looked on as the outstanding
one in the country and the winner
of it was considered the national
champion. Undoubtedly it hits more
tradition back of it than its rival, the
N.C.A.A., but a perusal of figures
will definitely show that the 1.C.4-A.
group is overwhelmingly Eastern.
There are 43 colleges listed as
members of the I.C.A.A.A.A. Of
these, 37 are Eastern, two (Michigan
and Michigan State) are of the Mid-
West, and the four big California
colleges represent the Far West.
The first 1.C.4-A. meeting was held
in 1876, but it was not until 1885
that the first name not strictly East
ern was found in the summaries
when Michigan appeared. Ten years
later lowa's name was found in the
summaries and in 1900 the first Pa
cific Coast school made a showing
when California was an entrant.
WESTERN SCHOOLS
HAVE "MADE" GOOD
Of late years the Pacific Coast
colleges have dominated the meets
and literally "made" them as far as
any great interest outside of the
East is concerned. In the last 13
years California has won the title
three times, Stanford three times,
and U.S.C. six, the East interrupting
the succession of Western victories
but once in that time with a Yale
victory in 1924.
Never has the West been repre
sented by more than three universi
ties, often by only two, while seldom
more than one of the two Mid-West
ern schools enters. Michigan has
preferred the N.C.A.A. meet for sev
eral years.
Despite this fact, the West has
managed to take a lion's share of the
points in the last decade. As an ex
ample, last year U.S.C. took first,
Stanford second, with U.C.L.A. rep
resented by only two men just a few
places back, which gave the Pacific-
Coast athletes a total of 97 points
out of a possible 225.
WEST SHOWS
BETTER PERFORMANCES
The N.C.A.A. is a much more rep
resentative meet, admitting colleges
from all over the country. Obser
vation points to the fact that track
supremacy has moved westward and
most of the outstanding perform
ances are being made in the Mid-
West, South, or on the Coast where
conditions are favorable to a longer
training period. The East has turned
out some great stars in recent years,
including Bonthron of Princeton,
Brown of Yale, Hallowell of Har

vard, Can* of Pennsylvania, and sev
eral others, but these men are ex
ceptions rather than the rule and a

not truly national in scope. And

1.C.4-A. REALLY
EASTERN MEET
For years the 1.C.4-A. meet has
been looked on as the outstanding
one in the country and the winner
of it was considered the national
champion. Undoubtedly it hits more
tradition back of it than its rival, the
N.C.A.A., but a perusal of figures
will definitely show that the 1.C.4-A.
group is overwhelmingly Eastern.
There are 43 colleges listed as
members of the I.C.A.A.A.A. Of
these, 37 are Eastern, two (Michigan
and Michigan State) are of the Mid-
West, and the four big California
colleges represent the Far West.
The first 1.C.4-A. meeting was held
in 1876, but it was not until 1885
that the first name not strictly East
ern was found in the summaries
when Michigan appeared. Ten years
later lowa's name was found in the
summaries and in 1900 the first Pa
cific Coast school made a showing
when California was an entrant.
WESTERN SCHOOLS
HAVE "MADE" GOOD
Of late years the Pacific Coast
colleges have dominated the meets
and literally "made" them as far as
any great interest outside of the
East is concerned. In the last 13
years California has won the title
three times, Stanford three times,
and U.S.C. six, the East interrupting
the succession of Western victories
but once in that time with a Yale
victory in 1924.
Never has the West been repre
sented by more than three universi
ties, often by only two, while seldom
more than one of the two Mid-West
ern schools enters. Michigan has
preferred the N.C.A.A. meet for sev
eral years.
Despite this fact, the West has
managed to take a lion's share of the
points in the last decade. As an ex
ample, last year U.S.C. took first,
Stanford second, with U.C.L.A. rep
resented by only two men just a few
places back, which gave the Pacific-
Coast athletes a total of 97 points
out of a possible 225.
WEST SHOWS
BETTER PERFORMANCES
The N.C.A.A. is a much more rep
resentative meet, admitting colleges
from all over the country. Obser
vation points to the fact that track
supremacy has moved westward and
most of the outstanding perform
ances are being made in the Mid-
West, South, or on the Coast where
conditions are favorable to a longer
training period. The East has turned
out some great stars in recent years,
including Bonthron of Princeton,
Brown of Yale, Hallowell of Har

vard, Can* of Pennsylvania, and sev
eral others, but these men are ex
ceptions rather than the rule and a
comparison of times and distances
between Eastern and Western meets
will show a great advantage on the
side of the later.
Such a comparison was made fol
lowing the Penn relays, Drake re
lays, and Fresno relays, meets held
in three different sections of the
country, and it was found that the
latter two were well ahead of the
Eastern performances. Hornbostel
of Indiana was responsible for the
time in the mile at the Penn relays
which was one of the few events in
which the Eastern meet excelled.

Women tennis stars will exhibit

grounds that the meet was "not

that the Faculty Committee stepped
out of bounds in giving that as its

FAVORED
TO WIN
Alice Philp, who has just climbed
to the third rung of the tennis lad
der by defeating Betty Pearce, is
teamed with Ben Dey, first in frosh
tennis, and co-champion with Gene
Mako in the national junior doubles.
They make up the favored team.
Seeded are Margaret Diedrich,
second on the ladder, and Chuck
Otis, varsity captain. They looked
strong, indeed, in their practice game
with Elizabeth Kesting and Monty
Schwayder, varsity doubles man.
Kesting heads the women's tennis
ladder, and ranks first in national
doubles with Helen Fulton, who
helped Schwayder win the mixed
doubles cup last year.
CRYSTAL
GAZING
Betty Pearce, and Bill Seward,
frosh captain, seeded fourth, are an
exceptional pair, and with the three
teams above have a -30 handicap.
Pearce and Seward meet Marjorie
Wakefield and Burt Goldstein in the
first round, and it looks as though,
what with the latter's handicap boost
of plus 15, that an upset may occur.
Right next to the seeded players
are Dot Ann Jackson, one of the
best, playing with Glenn Reed, grad
and former varsity member, with a
handicap of 15 and 3-6, dangerous
competition.
SOME VERY
DARK HORSES
Then there are the dark horses
that add to the interest of races and
tournaments. Three teams may be
classed: Mary Mayer and Ted Lilien

year; Virginia Swafford and A1 Bo

Clayburgh with Bob Lilienthal.

Among the higher-ups also are

GRIPES AT FACULTY
ATHLETIC GROUP
Plenty of gripes have been heard
since the Faculty Athletic Commit
tee decided that no more Stanford
track teams would be allowed to en
ter the 1.C.4-A meets after this year,
and some of the loudest have come
from sports critics on San Francisco
newspapers.
One of the biggest appeared yes
terday morning in a bay city sports
page and criticized the P"aculty Ath
letic Committee for its stand in
withdrawing from the 1.C.4-A on the
grounds that the meet was "not
Iruly representative." It may be true
that the Faculty Committee stepped
out of bounds in giving that as its
reason since the group is an acade
mic one, not a schedule-making
body, and it's undoubtedly unfortu
nate that the announcement came
when it did. It will put Stanford's
seven representatives this year in an
awkward position when they arrive
in Philadelphia, but the fact still re
mains that their statement is a cor
rect one—that the 1.C.4-A meets are
not truly national in scope. And
also, if Stanford is to withdraw from
the meets, it is better to make the
announcement in plenty of time to
avoid criticism on the grounds of
"running out."
1.C.4-A. REALLY
EASTERN MEET
For years the 1.C.4-A. meet has
been looked on as the outstanding
one in the country and the winner
of it was considered the national
champion. Undoubtedly it hits more
tradition back of it than its rival, the
N.C.A.A., but a perusal of figures
will definitely show that the 1.C.4-A.
group is overwhelmingly Eastern.
There are 43 colleges listed as
members of the I.C.A.A.A.A. Of
these, 37 are Eastern, two (Michigan
and Michigan State) are of the Mid-
West, and the four big California
colleges represent the Far West.
The first 1.C.4-A. meeting was held
in 1876, but it was not until 1885
that the first name not strictly East
ern was found in the summaries
when Michigan appeared. Ten years
later lowa's name was found in the
summaries and in 1900 the first Pa
cific Coast school made a showing
when California was an entrant.
WESTERN SCHOOLS
HAVE "MADE" GOOD
Of late years the Pacific Coast
colleges have dominated the meets
and literally "made" them as far as
any great interest outside of the
East is concerned. In the last 13
years California has won the title
three times, Stanford three times,
and U.S.C. six, the East interrupting
the succession of Western victories
but once in that time with a Yale
victory in 1924.
Never has the West been repre
sented by more than three universi
ties, often by only two, while seldom
more than one of the two Mid-West
ern schools enters. Michigan has
preferred the N.C.A.A. meet for sev
eral years.
Despite this fact, the West has
managed to take a lion's share of the
points in the last decade. As an ex
ample, last year U.S.C. took first,
Stanford second, with U.C.L.A. rep
resented by only two men just a few
places back, which gave the Pacific-
Coast athletes a total of 97 points
out of a possible 225.
WEST SHOWS
BETTER PERFORMANCES
The N.C.A.A. is a much more rep
resentative meet, admitting colleges
from all over the country. Obser
vation points to the fact that track
supremacy has moved westward and
most of the outstanding perform
ances are being made in the Mid-
West, South, or on the Coast where
conditions are favorable to a longer
training period. The East has turned
out some great stars in recent years,
including Bonthron of Princeton,
Brown of Yale, Hallowell of Har

vard, Can* of Pennsylvania, and sev
eral others, but these men are ex
ceptions rather than the rule and a
comparison of times and distances
between Eastern and Western meets
will show a great advantage on the
side of the later.
Such a comparison was made fol
lowing the Penn relays, Drake re
lays, and Fresno relays, meets held
in three different sections of the
country, and it was found that the
latter two were well ahead of the
Eastern performances. Hornbostel
of Indiana was responsible for the
time in the mile at the Penn relays
which was one of the few events in
which the Eastern meet excelled.
