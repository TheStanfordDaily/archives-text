# Card Swim Stars To Clash Here Tonight
## TWO MEET TITLES IN DANGER; CLARK, FOSTER TO SWIM 
### 
For the last time this term, En
ema pools will open up to women
and other guests tonight as Coach
Nort Thornton's swimmers wind up
their competitive season in two Pa
cific Ass o c i a t i on championship
events.
The PA. title in the 440-yard
breast stroke and 440-yarcl free style
will be settled tonight in a program
consisting of three trial heats and fi
nals in each event, an exhibition
diving match, and an exhibition 50-
yard back stroke.
General admission tiekals veil for
40 cents, and students will be ad
mitted for 25 cents. The meet will
get under way promptly at 8 o'clock,
according to Thornton, who is ar
ranging the affair.
Eleven Teams
Swimmers will represent Stanford,
Olympic Club, San Francisco Y.M.
C.A., Lakeside, Athens Club, Cali
fornia, Sati Francisco Junior College,
Golden Gate Junior College, and
Menlo Junior College.
Fifteen entries have signed to par
ticipate in each of the two races. The
first two place men in each heat will
qualify for the finals, and the diving
and exhibition back stroke will give
the qualifiers time to rest between
spurts.
The Y.M.C.A., leading aquatic
group in Northern California, is en
tering 11 men in the pair of events.
The "Y" will have eight swimmers
competing in the free style race
alone.
Stanford's hopes lie in Captain
elect Bob Foster, Captain Bob Clark,
and John Kulin. Foster is favored to
beat Clark in the breast stroke, but
both should finish near the front.
Kuhti is a dark horse candidate for
a place in the quarter-mile free
style swim.
Olds vs. Lindegren
Buster Olds, Olympic Club, who
lost to Art Lindegren after swim
ming stroke lor stroke with the
Y.M.C.A. star in the P.A. 220-yard
finals, is favored over the longer
quarter-mile free style course. Lin
degren is competing for the first time
in his career in the longer race, but
his sprinting record makes him a fa
vorite to place, and he may even beat
Olds.
Whoever wins the race almost
surely will set up a new meet record.
Olds has already completed the dis
tance in more than a minute faster
than the P.A. standard, and nearly
every entry is capable of breaking
the record of 6 minutes 8 seconds.
Record for Foster
Foster is favored to install a new
American mark in the breast stroke.
The present national record of 6:16.6
was set in the second annual Stan
ford relays here last year by John
Paulsen of U.S.C.
Foster's chief opposition is ex
pected from Clark, although Warren
Smith of Lakeside and Henry John

son of the Olympic Club are looked
to for places and possibly one of
these will upset the Card star.
Tom Boothe, Milt Friedman, Mau
rice Berger, and Dave Cox will dive
between the trials and finals, and
Holly Fitting, Jack Bergman, Jack
Myers, and Bob Etienne, all of the
Stanford team, will compete in the
special 50-yard back stroke.
