# DECATHLON ENTRY LIST MAY BE CLOSED; MOVE RKQUIRED BY HEAVY REGISTRATION
## 
### 
With but one week at the most re
maining in which to enter, the entry
list for Stanford's first Annual All-
Spoils Decathlon May 23, 29, and 30,
is mounting rapidly.
The competition, designed to se
lect the best all-around athlete at
Stanford, is open to any registered
student, but if the entry list, keeps
on mounting it may be necessary, in
order to facilitate efficient handling
of the events, to set a time limit after
which entries will not be accepted.
If this is found to be necessary, the
closing d'ate will be announced in
the Daily.
The events to be used in the de
cathlon have been selected as far as
possible to give every entrant an
equal chance and not to give an act
vantage to men who have been out
for some sport throughout the season.
For that reason, the 50-yard dash
and standing broad jump were se
lected as the track events rather
than the more common 100-yard
dash and running broad jump. It
was felt that a man who has been
practicing for the century or 220 with
the track squad would have less ad
vantage over a man who has spent
his time with basketball or some
other sport in running the 50. The
same held true in selecting the
standing rather than the running
broad jump.
It was also felt that the football
punt for distance would not give an
advantage to football players due to
the fact that only a few football men
practice punting and a great number
of athletes not out for football have

had practice in punting in touch
football during the year.
The baseball throw for distance
was chosen instead of the throw for
accuracy because it was believed that
baseball players would have an ad
vantage in the latter which they
would not have in the former, which
depends more on natural ability than
on practice.
In order to allow those to enter
who have not had a chance to sign
up on the entry list on the intramu- '

rul bulletin hoard in Encina gym, an
entry coupon is being run in today's
Daily which may be filled out and}
turned over to Marvie Kahn, 415 i

practicing for the century or 220 with
the track squad would have less ad
vantage over a man who has spent
his time with basketball or some
other sport in running the 50. The
same held true in selecting the
standing rather than the running
broad jump.
It was also felt that the football
punt for distance would not give an
advantage to football players due to
the fact that only a few football men
practice punting and a great number
of athletes not out for football have

had practice in punting in touch
football during the year.
The baseball throw for distance
was chosen instead of the throw for
accuracy because it was believed that
baseball players would have an ad
vantage in the latter which they
would not have in the former, which
depends more on natural ability than
on practice.
In order to allow those to enter

With but one week at the most re
maining in which to enter, the entry
list for Stanford's first Annual All-
Spoils Decathlon May 23, 29, and 30,
is mounting rapidly.
The competition, designed to se
lect the best all-around athlete at
Stanford, is open to any registered
student, but if the entry list, keeps
on mounting it may be necessary, in
order to facilitate efficient handling
of the events, to set a time limit after
which entries will not be accepted.
If this is found to be necessary, the
closing d'ate will be announced in
the Daily.
The events to be used in the de
cathlon have been selected as far as
possible to give every entrant an
equal chance and not to give an act
vantage to men who have been out
for some sport throughout the season.
For that reason, the 50-yard dash
and standing broad jump were se
lected as the track events rather
than the more common 100-yard
dash and running broad jump. It
was felt that a man who has been
practicing for the century or 220 with
the track squad would have less ad
vantage over a man who has spent
his time with basketball or some
other sport in running the 50. The
same held true in selecting the
standing rather than the running
