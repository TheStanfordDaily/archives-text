# "Radio Pen" Developed To Rival Loudspeaker
## 
### 
NEW YORK, May 17
signed for the reception of printed
and other material in the home as an
attachment for the radio receiver, in
place of the loudspeaker, is the "ra
dio pen," a device based on the prin
ciple of facsimile air transmission of
the printed, written, or pictured
word.
John V. L. Hogan, New York ra
dio engineer, and his assistants de
veloped the apparatus.
Operating at a speed of approxi
mately 40 words a minute, the radio
pen is housed in a metal cabinet
about the size of a typewriter. It
can turn out comic pictures, a bridge
problem or outline drawings for
children to paint in their playrooms.
