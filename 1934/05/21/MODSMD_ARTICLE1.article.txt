# STANFORD-B.G. FORENSIC TOPIC STIRS INTEREST
## English Educational System To Be Contrasted With American Setup CARDS TAKE NEGATIVE Woodbury, Grantier Slated To Uphold Farm 
### 
Considerable interest has been
aroused in the School of Education
over the subject of the debate be
tween the University of British Col
umbia and Stanford on Thursday at
7:30 o'clock in the Little Theatre:
Resolved, that the English system of
education is a better system than the
American system as a preparation
for life. Stanford will uphold the
negative.
Speakers from British Columbia
will be John Conway, one of the
most prominent debaters in western
Canada, debate manager of the Parl
iamentary Forum for the coming
year, and a participant in the usual
squad debaters; and Ernest Brown,
one of the founders of the Parlia
mentary Forum and a member of
the Western Canadian debating
team.
Woodbury to Speak
Stanford will be represented by
Rollin Woodbury, a participant in
the Stanford northern tour last fall,
winner of an extemporaneous speak
ing contest of the Pacific Forensic
League; and Robert Grantier, also
a member of Stanford's northern
tour last fall.
The subject is believed to be a
pertinent question for the consider
ation of all modern students. It
teems with possibilities of an inter
esting discussion, including not only
the consideration of the relative
merits of the respective education
systems, but a practical considera
tion of what we mean by "prepara
tion for life".
Radio Debate Scheduled
Following the main campus de
bate, the two schools will meet over
radio station KYA at 4 o'clock on
Monday, May 28. The debaters will
be Spencer Thompson of Stanford
and Ernest Brown of British Co
lumbia.
Students will be admitted free to
the Little Theatre debate if they
show a student body card, and gen
eral admission will be 25 cents.
