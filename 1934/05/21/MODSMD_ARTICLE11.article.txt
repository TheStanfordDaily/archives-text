# Foster Sets New Record
## Olds Swims to Coast Mark In 440-Yard Free Style 
### 
Bob Foster, captain-elect of the
Stanford swimming team, shattered
the American national record for
the 440-yard breast stroke in the
Encina pools as he won the Senior
Pacific Association title in the event.
Foster, after swimming a trial
heat, came back to complete the
quarter mile in 6 minutes 5.7 sec
onds, chopping nearly nine seconds
from the old mark of 6:16.6, which
was set here last year by John
Paulsen of the University of South
ern California.
First Laps Even
Foster started slowly and swam
neck and neck with Warren Smith
of Lakeside for the first few laps
before he was able to pull ahead for
a comfortable lead with which he
coasted to the. record.
Buster Olds, Olympic Club star,
won the Senior P.A. 440-yard free
style title in 5 minutes 1.8 seconds
to set another new Pacific Associa
tion mark. This race has been can
celed from recent P.A. programs,
and the old mark, which was set
several years ago, was 6 minutes 17
seconds.
Kuhn Qualifies
In the breast stroke, Foster won
the first heat in 7 minutes 4 sec- ;
onds, after he was forced by mistake j
to paddle two extra laps. Ken Liv
ingston of Stanford barely failed to
qualify in the second heat. Because |
of a cold, Captain Bob Clark, an- \
other Card breast-stroke star, did
not enter the contest.
Olds had little trouble winning
the first heat of the free-style race, i
Jack Kuhn, only Indian varsity en- i
try, qualified with a third place in
this heat.
