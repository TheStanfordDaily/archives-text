## 
### MARTHA SPRAGUE 
Making beds, cleaning out Quad
buildings, yet still finding time to
eat four meals a day is all part of the
work of the janitors employed here
under the American Building and
Maintenance Company.
This was revealed by Manager
John M. Brown in explaining the
janitorial system. Although-a woman
was in charge of them for a short
period following the war, Bruwn has
held his position for the past 10
years.
Working from breakfast until noon
when Roughs are away at classes,
the janitors make beds, dust, and
supply clean linen in Toyon, Bran
ner, Encina, Sequoia, and the Old
Union.
After their free afternoons tfrey
spend the time from their supper un
til 9 o'clock evenings on Quad clean
ing away the debris resulting from
a day's classes, and cleaning black
boards.
Though in former days it was most
difficult to employ men who were
willing to clean out the rooms in the
anatomy building where the stiffs
were kept, improved conditions

| down there have now eliminated
: this difficulty. Lights were formerly
wont to go of! while the men were
; in the midst r work, and many
ghost talcs have survived of those to
j whom the experiences befell.
One of the most gruesome of these
, is th;it of a Filipino workman who
was there during a thunderstorm
| when the room suddenly became en
i veloped in darkness. His companions
left immediately, but when they re
turned to look for him he was found
! dead upon the floor.
j The janitors have their own quar
ters near the power house across
from the men's gym, where they live
the year round. Each has his own
room, while the group cats in a com
mon dining hall. It is the staggered
shifts during the morning and eve
ning which is responsible for their
four meals.
Though the exact number of jani
tors was not revealed, Brown stated
that many nationalities are repre
sented, with 90 per cent being citi
zens of the United States.

tliiit co-operation is easier with men
