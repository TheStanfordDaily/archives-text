# '34 Quad Sales Pick Up As Date For Release Set
## 
### 
The Stanford Quad will be
out May 29. In the last week
Quad sales have more than
doubled over the previous
week. Procastinating purchasers
of the '34 Quad can safely wait
no longer to purchase an order
for the year hook, warns Hal
Whitfield, business manager.
"We expect a complete sellout
this year," he assured. Sales
men will be on duty at the post
office this week to take orders
from 8 to 12 o'clock.
All sections of the new book
go to press today. Anyone
wishing his name on the cover
should notify the Quad before
Wednesday. Whitfield suggests
that installment buyers make
their last payment before May
29 to save time and trouble
when the book is distributed.
