# Hint Arson in Chicago Fire
## Labor Troubles Blamed In $10,000,000 Blaze 
### 
CHICAGO. May 20 OP).â€”Speedy
reconstruction began today at the
scene of Chicago's most disastrous
fine since 1871, while investigators
sought to determine if the blaze that
had its origin in the Union Stock
Yards was incendiary.
Thomas J. Sheehan, city fire attor
ney, was in charge of an investiga
tion to determine if (he $10,000,000
fire that consumed more than a
dozen major buildings, scores of pri
vate homes, and several one- and
two-story flat buildings, might have
had its origin as a result of labor
agitation.
1,500 Given Aid
Approximately 1,500 persons were
treated for injuries, but no deaths
were reported although searchers in
the razed and fire-scorched 80 acres
covered by the fires feared several
bodies might be found in the wreck
age. Most of the 400 suffering severe
burns that necessitated hospital
treatment were men who had battled
the blaze four and one-half hours
last night.
"I have been informed," Sheehan
said, "that there has been quite a bit
of labor agitation in the yards i"e
cently and violence has attended the
difficulties. One superintendent, in
the yards where the fire started, who
is now being sought to be ques
tioned, has been quoted as saying he
was convinced labor trouble was at
the bottom."
Rebuilding Begun
The conflagration started, accord
ing to the latest belief, in a cattle
pen inside the yards late yesterday.
Tinder-dry pens and barns were
razed rapidly before firemen could
control the blaze, which leaped out
side the yards.
Men were busy today clearing
away wreckage, and the rebuilding
of the pens had already commenced
to take care of the cattle shipments
on their way.
Insurance figures on the loss of
the fire likely will not be available
until tomorrow but Jay S. Glidden,
head of the Chicago Board of Un
derwriters, said he believed the loss
would be less than the estimates by
fire officials.
C. M. Cartwright, editor of the
National Underwriter, trade publi
cation, said: "The loss will not be
known definitely until the insurance
men get down there and dig it out."
While insurance men were making
inspections preparatory to their re
ports, Henkle, general manager of
the stock yards, said his survey
convinced him that yards property
was damaged to the extent of $5,-
000,000 or $6,000,000.
