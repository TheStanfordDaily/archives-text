# Yodelling Saves Lives Of Overturned Oarsmen

### 
SEATTLE. Wash., May 20 (/Pi.â€”
The vocal effort of yodeling, some
times cheered and frequently jeered, j
saved two Seattle men from a wa- i
tery grave in frigid Pugct Sound j
early today.
The men, C. T. Hanes and L. C.
Ireland, employees of a Seattle fur
niture company, overturned their
skiff off Point-No-Point last night
while going ashore from a yacht.
They clung to the upturned craft for ;
hours until finally Ireland weakened
and advised Hanes to swim for
shore.
Shortly afterward, Ireland * be
came unconscious, but Hanes
reached across the boat, seized him j
by the sweater and continued to j
hold on. After long hours the black 1
hulk of the tug Roosevelt appeared j
through the gloom.
