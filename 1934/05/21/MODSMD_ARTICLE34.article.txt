## Drunk Beer Parlor Patron May Shed New Light On Mystery Death WOMAN AIDS SEARCH Two Coed Companions Not To Be Questioned 
### 
Possibility that a new light might
be shed oil the circumstances sur
rounding the mysterious death of
Peter Jewett, Stanford freshman,
was held out over the week-end as
Sheriff James J. McGrath of San
Mateo County searched for an un
named Redwood City man reported
to have been drunk in the Klondike
beer stand when Jewett and his two
companions were there.
The witness was reported out of
town and could not be found Satur
day. McGrath was not in his office
yesterday and could not be reached
for further information.
The search for the man in question
was instituted after a Redwood City
woman, also unnamed, had been
questioned by McGrath and Harold
Anderson, deputy district attorney
of San Mateo County. What trans
pired during the questioning could
not be learned yesterday, but the
search for the unknown man re
sulted.
Because they had been returned
to their campus residence before
Jewett and his companion Henderson
went to the Klondike, two Stanford
women who accompanied the two
men to a dancing party in a San
Francisco hotel earlier in the even
ing will not be held for questioning,
one of the girls revealed last night.
As far as it can be learned from the
sheriff's office in Redwood City, the
girls were not questioned Saturday.
