SOFIA, Bulgaria, May 20 (/P). —
Leaders of the coup d'etat, by which
the army took control of the nation,
worked feverishly behind a ring of
machine guns and bayonets today to
set up a new government.
Controlling affairs was Kimon Gu
eorguieff, 52-year old premier ap
pointed by King Boris after the
army's swift seizure of authority.
Sofia resumed its normal aspects
today. Only occasionally did mili
tary patrols march through the
streets.
The city, and apparently much of
the nation, accepted the unexpected
turn of affairs with a feeling of re
lief, and with revived hope for a
brighter day for Bulgaria.
