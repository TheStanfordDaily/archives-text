# No More Hell Week in Fraternities
## 
### 
Since Hie Interf'ratcrnity Council look its recent com
mendable action and abolished Hell Week, the Daily lias
watched with interest similar problems in other universi
ties around the West. One editorial appearing in a well
known publication said:
"Grown-up college men have: (lone out and robbed
chicken roosts because they were lold to; taken enough
cathartics at one lime to kill a horse because they were told
to; eaten worms because they were told to; acted like four
year-old children because tliev were told to; gone without
sleep Cor (>0 hours because they were lold to. And all this
is because of Hell Week. All lliis because it was tradi
tional and necessary in proving to 'the brothers' thai they
could 'take it' and act like men. Men? No, fools."
Members of fraternities on this campus have reason to
feel proud of their progressiveness. l T ndoubtcdly, there
are a few initiates who will have to be treated severely in
some manner to make t'hem understand that they should
lake account of themselves. But there are other methods
of doing it, and probably they will prove more satisfactory
in the long run.
That is only half of the problem at Stanford. The men
have solved their difficulties pretty thoroughly. But how
about the women? For years now, each sorority rushing
season has had an unsatisfactory conclusion. Although it
is under a different name and does not incorporate the
same type of treatment (supposedly), the sorority rushing
period has had terrifically bad effects on the rushees.
This year, as usual, dissatisfaction was expressed.
Nothing has been done about it. It is about time that
Panhellenic oflicials awaken and reali/e that they have a
had mess to clear up.
The rushing period of one week in January was a veri
table Hell Week, if even half of the stories coming out (if
Noble Hall and other dormitories are true. Everything was
disrupted. Women's health was impaired. Studying was
completely neglected. Harmony gave way to hysteria.
And linallv, pins were affixed to the dresses and a lot of
them smiled and thought that it was fine.
But it isn't line. Sorority women themselves readily
admit that things were far from what they should be. Yet
they do nothing about it or, if they have done anything,
they've managed to make it a secret.
Time rolls on. Commencement will be here soon. Then
comes summer vacation. And then Autumn Quarter, when
the lirst signs of rushing are seen. Soon another mess will
be'confronting the campus. A few days,of concentrated
thinking and fact-finding by Panhellenic could prevent
the recurrence. It should act now.
