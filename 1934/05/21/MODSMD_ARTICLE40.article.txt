THE U.S. TRIED |
TCJ PROMOTE PEACE
Beginning with Woodrow Wilson i
the last five presidents have tried to ;
protect the peace of the world by 1
reducing or limiting armaments.
This has been a policy of both Demo- j
ciats and Republicans. The govern
ment has taken part in three naval
conferences and in the decrepit ,
World Disarmament Conference.
Out of all this work there has come |
just one substantial result. The navy j
building race between the United :
States and England, which threat
ened to become destructive in 1021,
has been prevented. It is now the ;
accepted policy of both countries i
that their navies shall be equal and ;
non-competing.
BUT EUROPE
IS RE-ARMING
Outside of this nothing else of
lasting importance has been accom- '
plished. France and Italy refused to
limit all naval armaments; and when
it comes to armies and air forces the i
disarmament movement has failed (
completely in nearly all great pow- j
ers.
Today Germany is busy re-arm
ing. As Germany re-arms her neigh
bors do likewise. There is no chance !
of any reduction in the near future;
there is not even a chance of real
limitation. It looks as if Europe is
moving not. toward peace and dis
armament but toward war and re
armament. When, where, and why
ihe war will come is not Ihc im
portant thing. The important thing
is the fact that Europe is steadily

moving toward a war.
SO WHAT CAN
AMERICA DO?
Very few Americans want to get
into a war. So the main business of
the government is to take the path
which is least likely to involve the
U.S. in a dangerous entanglement.
As Walter Lippmann has said: "As
long as Europe prepares for war,
America must prepare for neutral
ity." It is the only course open to
us. Yet it is one of the hardest ones
to take and keep.
The hardest problem of neutrality
arises from the exercise of neutral
rights—the right to trade with na
tions at war. There is a big differ
ence between staying neutral in the
sense of staying out of a war, and in
staying neutral in the sense of ex
ercising all the "rights." The first
course is possible; the second is al
most impossible.
NEUTRALITY
HARD TO KEEP
To remain a neutral without rights
means the loss of most of a coun
try's foreign trade when big powers
are fighting. To uphold the "rights"
usually means entanglement sooner
or later.
In neither of the great wars of the
last century and a half, has the U.S.
been able to have both neutrality
and neutral rights. In both cases the
attempt to uphold our rights ended
in our entering the war.
Yel sooner or later a war will oc
cur. When it does, the U.S. will have
to choose between the two. It's
worth thinking about now.

NEUTRALITY
HARD TO KEEP
To remain a neutral without rights
means the loss of most of a coun
try's foreign trade when big powers
are fighting. To uphold the "rights"
usually means entanglement sooner
or later.
In neither of the great wars of the
last century and a half, has the U.S.
been able to have both neutrality
and neutral rights. In both cases the
attempt to uphold our rights ended
in our entering the war.
Yel sooner or later a war will oc
cur. When it does, the U.S. will have
to choose between the two. It's
worth thinking about now.
THE U.S. TRIED |
TCJ PROMOTE PEACE
Beginning with Woodrow Wilson i
the last five presidents have tried to ;
protect the peace of the world by 1
reducing or limiting armaments.
This has been a policy of both Demo- j
ciats and Republicans. The govern
ment has taken part in three naval
conferences and in the decrepit ,
World Disarmament Conference.
Out of all this work there has come |
just one substantial result. The navy j
building race between the United :
States and England, which threat
ened to become destructive in 1021,
has been prevented. It is now the ;
accepted policy of both countries i
that their navies shall be equal and ;
non-competing.
BUT EUROPE
IS RE-ARMING
Outside of this nothing else of
lasting importance has been accom- '
plished. France and Italy refused to
limit all naval armaments; and when
it comes to armies and air forces the i
disarmament movement has failed (
completely in nearly all great pow- j
ers.
Today Germany is busy re-arm
ing. As Germany re-arms her neigh
bors do likewise. There is no chance !
of any reduction in the near future;
there is not even a chance of real
limitation. It looks as if Europe is
moving not. toward peace and dis
armament but toward war and re
armament. When, where, and why
ihe war will come is not Ihc im
portant thing. The important thing
is the fact that Europe is steadily

moving toward a war.
SO WHAT CAN
AMERICA DO?
Very few Americans want to get
into a war. So the main business of
the government is to take the path
which is least likely to involve the
U.S. in a dangerous entanglement.
As Walter Lippmann has said: "As
long as Europe prepares for war,
America must prepare for neutral
ity." It is the only course open to
us. Yet it is one of the hardest ones
to take and keep.
The hardest problem of neutrality
arises from the exercise of neutral
rights—the right to trade with na
tions at war. There is a big differ
ence between staying neutral in the
sense of staying out of a war, and in
staying neutral in the sense of ex
ercising all the "rights." The first
course is possible; the second is al
most impossible.
