PETER (Rutherford Mayne)
At the Palo Alto Community Theatre
Peter, a young Irish college stu
dent, falls asleep in the prologue,
dreams for three acts, and awakes
in the epilogue. You do not know it
is all a dream until the end of the
play; as a result, you are mystified
for a long time at the growing con
fusion of the plot, and you are dis
appointed in the end when all prob
lems are solved rather flatly by
Peter's awakening., In place of plot,
Mayne has supplied some cleverly
written realistic scenes, numerous
deftly drawn individuals, and Irish
humor and whimsy.
Realizing that most of the play's
merit lay in the comedy of charac
ter rather than in comic lines or sit
uations, Welles pointed his direction
to emphasize the people of the play.
He was fortunate in having an ex
cellent cast.
James Quinby, occassionally melo
dramatic, gave a thoughtful and
cleancut performance of the loud
Sammy Partridge, striking a good
balance between comedy, pathos, and
villainy.
Joe Lawry, Egerton Lakin, Ches
ter Barker, and Malcolm McGilvray,
all with rattling good character parts,
succeeded in completely losing
themselves in their roles. As (re
spectively) the solicitous waiter who
hovers interminably, Tiger Blake
who barks about Bungapore, and dry
precise poet who writes lyrics, and
the somnolent man-mountain which
stirs infrequently, they set each other
off in neat contrast and supported
comfortably on their shoulders the
languid act, which suffered from
plot anemia.
George Hayes, with brusque di
rectness, and Henry Brill, using
much clever business, whipped
through the first act, aided by Eliza
beth Severson in a short but sweet
character bit and by Quinby in mak
ing the act an example of easy nat
uralness. Pat Gleason and Jeanette
Rosenfeld, attempting to portray un
realistic acmes of perfection in the
midst of such actual characters, were
handicapped inevitably by the play
itself. Gleason, who made Peter too
serious and too colorless, was at his
best in singing Mood Indigo.

VIVA VILLA (MGM)
At the Stanford Theatre
Stir together a pinch of humor, a
bit of pathos, and a touch of tragedy,
spice the mixture with comedy and
bind it together with grim realism.

There you have "Viva Villa," a pic
ture which fairly lives, and which
carries Wallace Beery to the great
est performance of his career.
The cast, uniformly fine, seems to
be inspired by Beery's great per
formance as Pancho Villa, the bandit
chief, and to respond by giving nat
ural performances that will absorb
even the most blase of theatregoers.
Direction is splendid, the director
showing a sympathetic understand
ing of Villa's ideals and an ability to
transmit those ideals to the screen
with little of the usual "hashing."
Photography reaches a new high
for American-made pictures, com
paring very favorably with that of
"Thunder Over Mexico" and "Storm
Over Asia." Some of the desert
are natural and breathtaking beau
tiful.
"Viva Villa" Is not an historical
picture. It is a work of fiction built
around the life of the great Mexican
idol, yet it follows historical facts
closely enough so that one is not
aware of any discrepancies.
It pictures a man who devotes his
life to an attempt to ease the hard
ships and cruelties forced upon his
peon countrymen, his success
through the unswerving loyalty of
his followers, and his death shortly
after accomplishing his life-long
purpose. —Honan
