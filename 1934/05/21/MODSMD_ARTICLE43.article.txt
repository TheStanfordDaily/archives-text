# BULL SESSION
## MORE MISFITS 
### 
Stanford debating is one of the
few campus activities proud cf the
fact that it is not self-supporting. By
far the greatest part of all local de
bating consists of informal dogfights
in the seclusion of squad meetings.
There, the hecklers hold forth; an
undisputed word i.s a curiosity. Chaos
is the keynote.
But once a year Stanford debaters
blossom forth in soup and fish for
something really classic. This year's
campus classic is the British Colum
bia debate on the subject, "Resolved,
that the English system of education
is better than the American system
us preparation for life."
The subject is both peculiar and
interesting, interesting because pe
culiar. Personally, we believe that
both the English and tho American
systems of education are the worst
possible preparations for life. If a
stucfent gets anything at, all out of a
modern college education, he i.s not
fit for life, but indeed becomes a
misfit.
Any species of training today
which teaches the university student
to concentrate on things cultural
rather than things material is posi
tively damning as far as preparation
for life in this world is concerned.
Perhaps the gentlemen from Canada
will consider "life" as meaning "life
in the hereafter," in which case they
will have a distinct advantage over
the local debaters. For while a col
lege education may lead college men
and women up to the pearly gates of
culture, that, same education carries
them straight to the hell gates of the
modern economic world.
We conceive of the economic side
of life as only a part of the whole
existence. But any training which
tells one to spurn the economic out
look, is counciling one to dissociate
himself from the Rotary Clubs and
Chamber of Commerce, to spurn the
babbits and cultivate the artists.
That is delightful, but disastrous
advice. If heeded, such advice will

cause the individual to be shunned,
and cast out of "life" in the world.
At Stanford, economics tells us to
think of the downtrodden laborer;
history and political science teaches
us to regard today's "leaders" as a
bunch of nincompoops; English
courses make us rebel at modern
literary trash. The training nause
ates us with all those things that
constitute modern life.
•
Military science seems to be the
only thing that prepares us to face
reality: to fight. And then citizen
ship and League of Nations tell us
not to fight—and so nullify the posi
tive 1 good of the military.
If college students get anything
out of college, they become misfits.

campus classic is the British Colum
bia debate on the subject, "Resolved,
that the English system of education
is better than the American system
us preparation for life."
The subject is both peculiar and
interesting, interesting because pe
culiar. Personally, we believe that
both the English and tho American
systems of education are the worst
possible preparations for life. If a
stucfent gets anything at, all out of a
modern college education, he i.s not
fit for life, but indeed becomes a
misfit.
Any species of training today
which teaches the university student
to concentrate on things cultural
rather than things material is posi
tively damning as far as preparation
for life in this world is concerned.
Perhaps the gentlemen from Canada
will consider "life" as meaning "life
in the hereafter," in which case they
will have a distinct advantage over
the local debaters. For while a col
lege education may lead college men
and women up to the pearly gates of
culture, that, same education carries
them straight to the hell gates of the
modern economic world.
We conceive of the economic side
of life as only a part of the whole
existence. But any training which
tells one to spurn the economic out
look, is counciling one to dissociate
himself from the Rotary Clubs and
Chamber of Commerce, to spurn the
babbits and cultivate the artists.
That is delightful, but disastrous
advice. If heeded, such advice will

cause the individual to be shunned,
and cast out of "life" in the world.
At Stanford, economics tells us to
think of the downtrodden laborer;
history and political science teaches
us to regard today's "leaders" as a
bunch of nincompoops; English
courses make us rebel at modern
literary trash. The training nause
ates us with all those things that
constitute modern life.

Military science seems to be the
only thing that prepares us to face
reality: to fight. And then citizen
ship and League of Nations tell us
not to fight—and so nullify the posi
tive 1 good of the military.
If college students get anything
out of college, they become misfits.

Stanford debating is one of the
few campus activities proud cf the
fact that it is not self-supporting. By
far the greatest part of all local de
bating consists of informal dogfights
in the seclusion of squad meetings.
There, the hecklers hold forth; an
undisputed word i.s a curiosity. Chaos
is the keynote.
But once a year Stanford debaters
blossom forth in soup and fish for
something really classic. This year's
campus classic is the British Colum
bia debate on the subject, "Resolved,
that the English system of education
is better than the American system
