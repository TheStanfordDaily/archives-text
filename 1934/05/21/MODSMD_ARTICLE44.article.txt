# CAMPUS OPINION
## EMPLOYERS CAUSE STRIKE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Having notiecd the letter about
scabs in your columns a few days
ago, may I point out that in the ag
ricultural strikes last year and at
cither times the claim is always made
that '"Communist agitators" foment
class-struggles. Strike leaders and
such Communists as I have heard
maintain that they merely point out
the existence of a class-struggle,
which is actually fostered by the rul
ing class. Does it not seem a little as
if the scab-recruting for this long
shoremen's strike in all the univer
sities of California (to which it may

' be supposed the "best" people go,
the sons and daughters of the ruling
class) bears out the contention thai
I one class is put against another not
I by the strikers but by those struck
against? Yours,
Matthew Evans.
