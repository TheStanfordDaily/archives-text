NATIONAL MEETS
OF THE DAY
Beginning with next week-end's
1.C.4-A, championships, which re
tain the name if not the actuality of
a national affair, track becomes defi
nitely country-wide in .scope. Fol
lowing the Philadelphia meet, most
of the outstanding collegiate stars of
tin- country will gather in Los Ange
les June 23 and 24 for the N.C.A.A.
event and thi.s will be followed by
the national A.A.U. championships
at Marquette University in Milwau
kee the following week-end.
Stanford will not be represented
at the latter meet, which includes
most of the stars of the country in
and out of college, but a number of
Indian athletes will probably com
pete in Milwaukee under club col
ors. Johnny Mottram and John Ly
man have already signified their
intention of entering.
GREAT DUELS
IN BOTH MEETS
The N.C.AA. will provide a num
ber of thrilling duels which will bo
carried over to the A.A.U. affair and
will be augmented by the entrance
of clubmen and college stars not
able to make the trip West. The
quarter-mile in the N.C.A.A. will
probably be hotly contested with
Glenn Hardin, A1 Blackman, Jimmy
LuValle, Karl Warner, Johnny Mc-
Carthy, and Ivan Fuqua, all having
shaded 47 flat on one side or the
other this year.
The shot will bring Lyman and
Torrance together again, and Leo
Sexton of New York A.C., the former
world record holder, will be added
in the A.A.U. meet. The A.A.U. will
also feature duels between Cun
ningham, Bonthron, and Venzke;
Metcalfe, Owens, and Kiesel; Mor
riss and Beard; and McCluskey and
Fellows.
NATIONAL POLO
CHAMPIONSHIP?
While on the subject of national
thi.s and that, it has been suggested
that some arrangement be made to
bring Stanford, Arizona, and Prince
ton, the three outstanding collegiate
polo teams of the country, together.
This is probably not feasible due to
financial difficulties, but if it could
be accomplished the result would be
highly interesting and some great !
polo.
With nearly all eyes turned to
track, the Coast football teams have
quietly gone through spring prac
tice and are prepared to open next
fall's schedule after a few weeks of
conditioning and polishing in Sep
tember. California, St. Mary's,
U.S.C., and U.C.L.A., have finished
this spring practice while Stanford
winds up this week.
Having lost but few men through
graduation and with plenty of able
men to fill the vacancies, the Bears
and Indians should dominate the
Coast next fall. U.S.C. will have a
lot of new faces in the line but a vet
eran backfield. However, the Tro
jans claim they have another dinky
back, a spohomore named Davis,
who will ably fill the place left va
cant by Warburton and outshine Bill
Howard, Warburton's understudy
who is slated to take over the quar
terback job next year. U.C.L.A. also
has a sophomore back, "Howie"'
Haradon by name, who scored two
touchdowns, one a 40-yard return of
n punt, and beat the first string 12
to 6 in the final game of spring
practice. —Tremaine

les June 23 and 24 for the N.C.A.A.
event and thi.s will be followed by
the national A.A.U. championships
at Marquette University in Milwau
kee the following week-end.
Stanford will not be represented
at the latter meet, which includes
most of the stars of the country in
and out of college, but a number of
Indian athletes will probably com
pete in Milwaukee under club col
ors. Johnny Mottram and John Ly
man have already signified their
intention of entering.
GREAT DUELS
IN BOTH MEETS
The N.C.AA. will provide a num
ber of thrilling duels which will bo
carried over to the A.A.U. affair and
will be augmented by the entrance
of clubmen and college stars not
able to make the trip West. The
quarter-mile in the N.C.A.A. will
probably be hotly contested with
Glenn Hardin, A1 Blackman, Jimmy
LuValle, Karl Warner, Johnny Mc-
Carthy, and Ivan Fuqua, all having
shaded 47 flat on one side or the
other this year.
The shot will bring Lyman and
Torrance together again, and Leo
Sexton of New York A.C., the former
world record holder, will be added
in the A.A.U. meet. The A.A.U. will
also feature duels between Cun
ningham, Bonthron, and Venzke;
Metcalfe, Owens, and Kiesel; Mor
riss and Beard; and McCluskey and
Fellows.
NATIONAL POLO
CHAMPIONSHIP?
While on the subject of national
thi.s and that, it has been suggested
that some arrangement be made to
bring Stanford, Arizona, and Prince
ton, the three outstanding collegiate
polo teams of the country, together.
This is probably not feasible due to
financial difficulties, but if it could
be accomplished the result would be
highly interesting and some great !
polo.
With nearly all eyes turned to
track, the Coast football teams have
quietly gone through spring prac
tice and are prepared to open next
fall's schedule after a few weeks of
conditioning and polishing in Sep
tember. California, St. Mary's,
U.S.C., and U.C.L.A., have finished
this spring practice while Stanford
winds up this week.
Having lost but few men through
graduation and with plenty of able
men to fill the vacancies, the Bears
and Indians should dominate the
Coast next fall. U.S.C. will have a
lot of new faces in the line but a vet
eran backfield. However, the Tro
jans claim they have another dinky
back, a spohomore named Davis,
who will ably fill the place left va
cant by Warburton and outshine Bill
Howard, Warburton's understudy
who is slated to take over the quar
terback job next year. U.C.L.A. also
has a sophomore back, "Howie"'
Haradon by name, who scored two
touchdowns, one a 40-yard return of
n punt, and beat the first string 12
to 6 in the final game of spring
practice. —Tremaine
