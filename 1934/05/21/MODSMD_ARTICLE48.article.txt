' the match. A birdie on 15 and an
i other on 16 with a half on 17 and a

1 the long tees subdued Hawley's

Hoerner One Up
The match started out with Hoer
ner one up on the first 18 holes. The
scores for the rounds were Hoerner,
76; Hawley, 77.
The first nine holes of the second
nine did not 'change the situation
materially. Both scores, 38s â€”two
over par figures.
In the second nine Hawley halved
the tenth hole. On the eleventh he
won, Hoerner three putting to take a
five. The long twelfth was halved.
A birdie made it two up for Hawley
on the thirteenth.
Hoerner Lags
The fourteenth was halved to leave
Hoerner on the under .side of two
and four score. On the fifteenth hole
he was on in two and down in one to
win. On the' sixteenth he hit two
long drives to reach the green in two
from the back trees. He putted out
for his birdie while Hawley hope
lessly out in the rough picked up.
The seventeenth was halved and (
they came onto the eighteenth hole \
with the score all even.
Both hit long, straight drives with
Hoerner a little to the back. On his j
second shot he made the green. The j
ball hit on the fender and bounced j
to about 20 feet from the cup. Haw
ley shot and landed in the trap to
the right. He was out in one and
down in two but it was not good
enough to tie Hoerner's birdie. The
long tees made the eighteenth a par
five for the tournament play.
Wind Hampers
The trophy that Hoerner will re
ceive was donated to the all-Uni
versity golf tournament by the heirs
of the late Reginald Hersh, Stanford
golf captain in 1926. It is known as
the Reginald Hersh award.
Both of the players were playing
e mediocre game, hampered a great
deal by the long tees and the high
wind that persisted during the I
match. Hawley made a 73 on the |
second eighteen while Hoerner had i
a 75.
