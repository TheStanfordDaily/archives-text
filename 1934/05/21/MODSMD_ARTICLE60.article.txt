# Mural Baseball Championship Settled Today
## Second Nine Will Reach Final Round; D.U.'s Are Given the Edge Sigma Nil's Are Favored To Gain Crown 
### 
One championship team will be
determined and another nine will
gain the final round in the intramu
ral baseball play-offs this afternoon.
In the hardball division, the Alpha
Delts and Sigma Nu's will clash with
the crown at stake, and at the same
time the D.U.'s and Phi Delts will
compete for the honor ol' facing the
A.T.O.'s tomorrow in the softball
class.
Sigma Nu's Ilate
Because of a slightly superior de
fensive record in the regular league
games, the Sigma Nu's rate the edge
over the Alpha Delts in the regula
tion horsehide final today.
Chuck Clancy, ace Sigma Nu hur
ler, held El Toro to four hits last
week while his mates were running
up a score of 15 to 0. Aurelius Bart
lett of the Alpha Delts is well within
Clancy's class, however; so this game
should be doped as nearly a toss-up.
In the playground ball division,
the D.U.'s are considered slight fa
vorites over the Phi Delts. Until
Thursday the Phi Delts would have
been given the edge because of more
decisive victories in the x'egular
league games, but the D.U.'s surpris
ing 4-2 win over the Dekes in the
quarter-final rates them the top spot.
Vigna Holds Dekes
Joe Vigna, star D.U. pitcher, held
the powerful Dekes to four hits
Thursday, while Cal Emeis, Mitch
Boyd, and John Fowler were lead
ing the assualt upon Dick Kelley,
the Dekes' ace moundsman. If Don
Greenlee, the Phi Delts' capable
pitcher, can stop that D.U. lead-off
trio, he may achieve a mild upset.
Either team will have to look good
in order to rate the edge in tomor
row's final with the A.T.O.'s, who
breezed through four straight league
games without too much trouble.
