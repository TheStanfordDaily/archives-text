The prolonged and widespread drought forced administration leaders at Washington to revise plans
to help western farmers meet dry weather losses. Shown here are Chester C. Davis (left), farm adminis
trator, and Victor A. Christgau, assistant administrator, studying a map on which is outlined the vast
acreage included in the wheat reduction campaign. It was decided to extend the deadline for signing
wheat reduction contracts so growers affected by the drought might still take advantage of benefit pay
ments offered under the program. (Associated Press Photo)
