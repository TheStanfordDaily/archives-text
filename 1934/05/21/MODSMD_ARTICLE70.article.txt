# Expert Predicts Palo Alto Tree Will Live Century

### CEDRIC LARSON 
Is the famous Palo Alto tree on
i the banks of San Francisquito Creek
at the crossing of the Southern Pa
cific doomed to an early death? In
the expert opinion of Dr. J. Clausen,
j botanist of the Stanford branch of
\ the Carnegie Institute, it may sur
j vive for an indefinite period, per
haps a century or more.
"This specimen of lcdwood i.s
known as Sequoia sempervirens,"
said Dr. Clausen, "and its true habi
tate is the fog-belt. This particular
Palo Alto tree is therefore some
i what out of its range, and its life
will be determined by climate

i changes."
The tree has always been a land
mark. It "was first sighted by the
Spainards in 1769, and prior to this
time was a meeting place of the In
dians. The famous Pedro Font topog
raphical map of 177G shows the place
where it stands.
It is probably 500 years or more
old, and the seed was, no doubt,
i washed down from the Santa Cruz
Mountains. If the tree lives for a
century more, as Dr. Clausen be
lieves it will, Stanford will have this
living embled of its seal surviving
j for many generations to come.
