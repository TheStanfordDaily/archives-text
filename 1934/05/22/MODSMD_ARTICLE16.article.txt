# Moot Court Tries Fake Desertion Case Tonight
## 
### 
Opportunity will be offered for
those interested to contrast our civil
court trial procedure with the quick,
non-dramatic routine of a military
court martial tonight at 7:30 o'clock
in' the faculty room of the military
headquarters building when Lt.-Col.
D. C. Cubbison's military law class
presents a mock court martial trial.
The trial, which will involve a
technical military charge of alleged
desertion from the army, will be
conducted by upperclass military
students assisted by three members
of the R.O.T.C. staff.
Colonel Cubbison will act as cpurt
president, corresponding to a civil
judge; Captain S. F. Miller will be
trial judge-advocate or district at
torney; while Captain I. A. Luke
will be defense counsel.
