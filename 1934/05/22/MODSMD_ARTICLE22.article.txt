# Ex Committee May Sanction Campus Theatre Plan Tonight
## 
### ANNALEE WHITMORE 
Plans for a campus theatre may
j draw one step nearer completion
, in tonight's Ex Committee meeting,
j after consideration of a report sub-
I mitted by Miriam Kropp, Stan Beau
; baire, and Sam Lee, which contains
full data on the theatre situation to
| date.
There is now a strong probability
I that the War Memorial Fund will be
utilized for the edifice; figures on
the cost per seat for the structure
are being compiled, and will be com-
I pleted in the near future.
Approximately $170,000 will com
i prise the fund, with interest accu
! mulated by next fall. Actual cost
| will, of course, exceed the figures.
; With student financial aid, which
â€¢ may bo sanctioned in tonight's meet
' ing, work may possibly begin early
j in the fall quarter.
Comptroller Almon E. Roth yes
terday indicated that alterations in
! the original plan are considered.
Contrary to previous expectations,
j it is possible that no memorial tower
: will be included. Instead, a court
will flank the theatre proper.
Workshops and classrooms, be
sides a secondary stage for rehear

sals, will supplement the assembly
: hall. Space will be provided for
construction of sets behind the stage,
from where they may be moved into
, place without occupying the stage
I itself during actual building proc
i esses. Ample storage space will be
- provided in a capacious basement.
Contrary to plans as last, an
nounced, the group will probably
occupy the block across the street
from the Art Gallery. Original
specifications'provided that it form
the nucleus of a second Quad, which
would include the Art Gallery and
Library.
A dramatic office will be placed
in the structure instead of the Old
Union, where it is suitaled at pres
ent. The court, outside the building,
will be similar to that of the Pan-
American Building in Washington.
The official University architects,
Bakewell and Brown, are outlining
possible constructions. Arthur Brown
possesses a reputation as one of the
four or five leading architects in the
United States, according to Roth, and
is now in Washington supervising
the construction of ' government
buildings.
