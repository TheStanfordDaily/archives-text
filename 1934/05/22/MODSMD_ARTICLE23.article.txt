# Sokol Tells Experiences With South Sea Savages
## 
### CEDRIC LARSON 
Jungle life and cannibalism in its
! primitive form remains a vivid mem-
I ory in the mind of Dr. Anthony C.
I Sokol of the Stanford Germanic
i Languages Department, who rc
| counts among his experience the loss
i of two Dutch men who were eaten
j by savages in the South Seas.
| During the World War, Sokol was
I a lieutenant in the Royal Austrian
i r.avy, and when the peace was signed
; he entered the service of a Dutch
West India company as one of the
! commanding officers of the ship
I "Van Neck" stationed in the Pacific.
Cruising near Humboldt Bay, New
Guinea, in 1922, Sokol's ship put in
j to take on supplies. This wild region
j was infested with cannibals of the
; most primitive type, and after cast-
I nig anchor, the crew observed sev
eral of the natives engaged in cere
monial dances on the beach. Two i
1 Dutch officers went ashore to watch
them.
The savages were preparing to
make a raid on another tribe for
cannibalistic purposes. They changed
| their minds, however, upon catching (
.sight of the two Dutchmen, whom
they regarded as a delicacy com
-1 pared to their tough-sinewed ncigh-
I bors. They luted them out of sight
! and dispatched them with their war
I clubs.
When the two officers failed to re- |

(turn, Sokol suspected foul play, and
hastily organized a punitive expedi
tion of a dozen whites and a score
of Malay soldiers. The village of the
offending natives was in the heart, of
I he dense, tropical jungle, and night
fall was approaching.
Undeterred by those factors, Sokol
led the way through the dangerous
flora of New Guinea, with flashlight,
hatchet, and rifle. All night they
slowly proceeded through tropical
thickets, full of poisonous serpents
end wild beasts, and toward morn
ing reached the village.
There they found the uniforms of
the officers in a heap, and close by
a pile of gnawed bones. The villag
ers were all asleep after their re
past. Sokol led his men cautiously
to the edge of the clearing, and then
gave the signal to advance. "We
charged into Ihe village like tigers,"
Sokol wrote of hi.s experience later.
Retribution was exacted of the sav
ages, but one prisoner was brought
back to the ship, from whom they
reconstructed the story of the trag
edy.
"This was one of the most grue
some nights I ever spent in the Fa:
East," Sokol reminisced. Dr. Sokol
has taught. German since leaving the
service of this Dutch company, and
this spring was promoted to as
sistant, professor in the Germanic
Languages Department at Stanford.

of Malay soldiers. The village of the
offending natives was in the heart, of
I he dense, tropical jungle, and night
fall was approaching.
Undeterred by those factors, Sokol
led the way through the dangerous
flora of New Guinea, with flashlight,
hatchet, and rifle. All night they
slowly proceeded through tropical
thickets, full of poisonous serpents
end wild beasts, and toward morn
ing reached the village.
There they found the uniforms of
the officers in a heap, and close by
a pile of gnawed bones. The villag
ers were all asleep after their re
past. Sokol led his men cautiously
to the edge of the clearing, and then
gave the signal to advance. "We
charged into Ihe village like tigers,"
Sokol wrote of hi.s experience later.
Retribution was exacted of the sav
ages, but one prisoner was brought
back to the ship, from whom they
reconstructed the story of the trag
edy.
"This was one of the most grue
some nights I ever spent in the Fa:
East," Sokol reminisced. Dr. Sokol
has taught. German since leaving the
service of this Dutch company, and
this spring was promoted to as
sistant, professor in the Germanic
Languages Department at Stanford.
Jungle life and cannibalism in its
! primitive form remains a vivid mem-
I ory in the mind of Dr. Anthony C.
I Sokol of the Stanford Germanic
i Languages Department, who rc
| counts among his experience the loss
i of two Dutch men who were eaten
j by savages in the South Seas.
| During the World War, Sokol was
I a lieutenant in the Royal Austrian
i r.avy, and when the peace was signed
; he entered the service of a Dutch
West India company as one of the
! commanding officers of the ship
I "Van Neck" stationed in the Pacific.
Cruising near Humboldt Bay, New
Guinea, in 1922, Sokol's ship put in
j to take on supplies. This wild region
j was infested with cannibals of the
; most primitive type, and after cast-
I nig anchor, the crew observed sev
eral of the natives engaged in cere
monial dances on the beach. Two i
1 Dutch officers went ashore to watch
them.
The savages were preparing to
make a raid on another tribe for
cannibalistic purposes. They changed
| their minds, however, upon catching (
.sight of the two Dutchmen, whom
they regarded as a delicacy com
-1 pared to their tough-sinewed ncigh-
I bors. They luted them out of sight
! and dispatched them with their war
I clubs.
When the two officers failed to re- |

(turn, Sokol suspected foul play, and
hastily organized a punitive expedi
tion of a dozen whites and a score
of Malay soldiers. The village of the
offending natives was in the heart, of
