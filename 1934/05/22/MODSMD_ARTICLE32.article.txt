# SWAIN STUDIES INDUSTRIES ON EUROPEAN TRIP
## Chemistry Dept. Head Returns after Brief Tour Abroad ATTENDS CONFERENCES Reports Many Changes In German Universities 
### George Wilson 
A two-month trip through Europe
would give the ordinary traveler
little more than a glimpse of old
world life, but in that brief time Dr.
Robert E. Swain, just back on tli â€¢
campus this week, found out much
about current political and economic
conditions across the Atlantic.
Although he made the trip pri
marily to attend conferences of
chemists in Paris and Madrid, Dr.
Swain traveled extensively in the
Central European countries, visiting
the great industrial plants of the
Rhine and Ruhr Valleys in Germany.
Germans Confident
Marked development and prog
ress under the Hitler regime is evi
dent, according to Dr. Swain, who
told of finding a peaceful and confi
dent German people, with unem
ployment cut nearly in third during
the past months.
"The entire field of education in
Germany is undergoing radical
changes," reports Dr. Swain. "Only
15,000 are at present studying in
universities as a result of the new
program."
At the conference in Madrid he
was one of 12 American representa
tives who met with 600 scientists
from 30 nations during a week'.,
time. Although topics discussed were
for the most part a bit too compii
catcd for the average person to un
derstand, much of value was brought
up, and the conference voted a
marked success.
Before going to Madrid, Dr. Swain
stopped at Paris, where he attended
another International Conference of
Chemistry during the last week in
March.
Meets Stanforditcs
During his tour, he met many
prominent Stanforditcs, among them
Dr. Aurelio Espinosa, who was
stopping in Madrid at the same time;
Tarn McGrew, a graduate now liv
ing in Paris; Donald Light, a chem
istry graduate and holder of a for
eign scholarship in Dresden; and
Carl Falk, formerly of Piedmont,
now a journalist and American rep
resentative and director of NBC in
Berlin.
Although he brought back with
him a wealth of material dealing
with the political situation of the
European countries, Dr. Swain ex
pressed the desire that he be allowed
to organize himself and to present
it in talks he is scheduled to give
next week, rather than give it out
at the present time.
