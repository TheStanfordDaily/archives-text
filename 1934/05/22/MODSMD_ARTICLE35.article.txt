Mothers, in the minds of many students, are helpful
things. In our grammar school days they always remefh
hered whieh chair or couch (o look behind when we
couldn't find our hat; or they could sooth any injury—
mental or physical; or ( they couid prepare a pretty tasty
dinner (with spinach), or put up a very edible lunch if
we were going on a hike. And they could do untold other
tilings, such as sewing a rip in a skirl or in a pair of
trousers.
And now that we are growing older and, for the most
part, living away from home, we are being weaned away
from many of the things which we used to look for. We
are becoming more independent and perhaps a hit for
getful.
Hut even at school, the mothers are with lis. In Stan
ford's particular case, they are organized into the Mothers'
(Hub of Stanford I'niversity, a group which has gone about
its business quietly (as mothers do) and which has done
an untold and unadvertised amount of good to many indi
viduals attending this school. Most of the campus doesn't
realize it, but the two rest homes are supported by the
Mothers' C.lub. There are other good things accomplished,
but the club doesn't prefer to tell the world how good it is;
it is content to sit back and quietly enjov the personal sat
isfaction of having done its good turns.
Tomorrow the group makes one of its two public ap
peals of the year. In the beautiful gardens of the Paid
Shoup home in Los Alios, the annual Mav Fete will be held
for the exclusive benefit of the rest homes. A number of
students are co-operating by participating in the various
concessions of the International Bazaar.
