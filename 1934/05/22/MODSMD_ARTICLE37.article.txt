## Longshoremen's Strike—Right or Wrong? 
### CROMPTON BANGS Jr 
now AND WHY
IT STARTED
Stevedores up and down the Pa
cific Coast have been on strike nearly
two weeks. Coast shipping has al
most been tied up. Called by the
International Longshoremen's Asso
ciation the strike has spread to other
A F. of L. unions on land and afloat.
Sympathetic strikes are starting
nearly every day. Up and down the
Pacific Coast things get more and
more critical all the time. What's it
all about and what does it mean?
The issues on both sides are un
usually clear-cut, and both sides are
unusually determined. Dissatisfied
with employer opposition to their
union, stevedores have long threat
ened action. Last month the employ
ers (mostly steamship companies)
refused to arbitrate the differences.
Firmly convinced that they could
win in no other way, the longshore
men struck.
WHAT EACH
SIDE W ANTS
The longshoremen want a 30-hour
week, with $1 an hour and $1.50 for
overtime. They are now getting 85
cents an hour with $1.25 for over
time. Some of the best gangs work
(10 hours a week; but stevedores are
lucky if they get 10 hours' work.
Tlie object of the 30-hour week ap
pears to be to divide what work there
i. l more evenly.
Besides they want a closod shop
(no non-union stevedores hired) and
at least joint control of the hiring
halls. They think the NKA guaran
tees them these things. The employ
ers don't think so.
On their side the employers are
grunJy determined that the Jpng

shoremen shall not get these things.
They say that the present wages are
plenty and that the best stevedores
ought to get the most work.
Employers are opposed to the
•closed shop and want no hiring halls
at all. They are apparently op
posed to arbitration also. They have
tried to break the strike by hiring
strikebreakers and college students
—at fancy prices because of the risk
involved.
WHAT
IT MEANS
Settlement of a strike where both
sides are unwilling to compromise is
almost impossible. Serious violence
in S.F. has so far been avoided—
only because the police have been
careful about breaking strikers'
heads. Things have been much
worse in Seattle. They are likely to
be worse here.
Sooner or later a company police
man, a striker or a picketer will start
something. Once the ball of violence
is set in motion, it will take the Na
tional Guard to stop it. The main
job now is to avoid this.
The Chamber of Commerce in
S.F. says the strike is the work of
Red agitators; it claims the issue is
one of American and un-American
(Red) principles. The issue Ls not so
simple u., this. Getting the supposed
Reds out will not solve the strike.
Neither side can get all it wants.
Compromise may be unwelcome
to eith r side, but the only alterna
tive is plenty of violence. This
would help nobody and do a lot of
harm. So the only thing to do is to
accept the U.S. help and get down <0
business and see what ran be done.
This can't go 011 forever.
