TWENTIETH CENTURY
(Columbia)
At the Mountain View Theatre
The producers of the film version
of this thorough-going satire wisely
obtained its authors (Hecht and
Mac Arthur) to adapt it for the
.screen; the resulting picture, with
the immense aid of John Barry
more, is excellently and breath
takingly paced screen .satire which
avoids the constant cinema danger
of pathos for the popular ear and
eye.
Barrymore revels in the role of
Oscar JafTe, a consciously mad, self
made artist who maintains a ridicu
lous pose of fitful genius. He leaps
and twitters, screams and writhes,
but always with an eye critically
I cocked to note his effect on his asso
ciates. No one is too unimportant to
be disregarded; the merest porter is
awed by hair-tossings and hand
wavings.
The satire is of a curious dual
sort, made so because Jaffe obvi
j ously recognizes his posings as such
I without deviating a jot from the
i practice of them. Given a free hand,
i Barrymore—never one to stint on
I theatrics—raves with the delighted
i abandon which, well directed, is one
|of his peculiar charms. If this role
| is, by very eccentricity, not one of
j his best, it is certainly one of his
: most gleeful.
TWO ALONE (RKO)
Elliot Nugent's direction of this
' screen version of Dan Totheroh's
"Wild Birds" is responsible for the
fact that its sentimentality never
palls and its melodramatics are ex
citing. His sympathy with the script
has been critical rather than aban
doned, and the resulting picture is
moving and beautiful.
Jean Parker continues to act sin
cerely and well; Tom Brown, also
thanks to Nugent's direction, im
proves in force. Here, as in "As the
Earth Turns," there is a happy and
genuine atmosphere of the soil, sans
artificial Hollywood glamour.

KEEP 'EM ROLLING (Radio)
At the Varsity Theatre
If you like sentimental pictures, if
you believe a man can love a horse
enough to go to prison for that horse,
if you enjoy flag waving and huzzas
for "Old Glory," and if you think
highly of Walter Huston, then this
picture is good.
The story, sometimes a bit far
fetched, is built around the United
States Army and its legends, and,
aided by shots of Fort Myer, Vir
ginia, and the co-operation of the
16th Field Artillery, presents an in
teresting and true-to-life picture of
army activities.
The cast is dominated by Walter
Huston, and, although good, is rele
gated so far to the background that
individual performances are hardly
noticed.
BOLERO (Paramount)
This opus, with everything else in :
its favor, still misses due to inade
quacies of a story which is incapable
of maintaining interest through an
hour's showing.
George Raft, as the dancing hero, i
handles his role in a manner remi
niscent of Valentino. Carole Lom
mard, usually somewhat inadequate,
is fine, as is the remainder of the
supporting cast.
Credit for fine direction must be
given to Wesley Ruggles, who takes
advantage of every opportunity to
liven up the weak and slightly bor
ing story.
Dancing, as done by Raft and
Lombard, is the highlight of the pic
lure, reaching a climax in masterly
handling of the bolero. —Honan j
