TWENTIETH CENTURY
(Columbia)
At the Mountain View Theatre
The producers of the film version
of this thorough-going satire wisely
obtained its authors (Hecht and
Mac Arthur) to adapt it for the
.screen; the resulting picture, with
the immense aid of John Barry
more, is excellently and breath
takingly paced screen .satire which
avoids the constant cinema danger
of pathos for the popular ear and
eye.
Barrymore revels in the role of
Oscar JafTe, a consciously mad, self
made artist who maintains a ridicu
lous pose of fitful genius. He leaps
and twitters, screams and writhes,
but always with an eye critically
I cocked to note his effect on his asso
ciates. No one is too unimportant to
be disregarded; the merest porter is
awed by hair-tossings and hand
wavings.
The satire is of a curious dual
sort, made so because Jaffe obvi
j ously recognizes his posings as such
I without deviating a jot from the
i practice of them. Given a free hand,
i Barrymore—never one to stint on
I theatrics—raves with the delighted
i abandon which, well directed, is one
|of his peculiar charms. If this role
| is, by very eccentricity, not one of
j his best, it is certainly one of his
: most gleeful.
TWO ALONE (RKO)
Elliot Nugent's direction of this
' screen version of Dan Totheroh's
"Wild Birds" is responsible for the
fact that its sentimentality never
palls and its melodramatics are ex
citing. His sympathy with the script
has been critical rather than aban
doned, and the resulting picture is
moving and beautiful.
Jean Parker continues to act sin
cerely and well; Tom Brown, also
thanks to Nugent's direction, im
proves in force. Here, as in "As the
Earth Turns," there is a happy and
genuine atmosphere of the soil, sans
artificial Hollywood glamour.

KEEP 'EM ROLLING (Radio)
At the Varsity Theatre
If you like sentimental pictures, if
you believe a man can love a horse
enough to go to prison for that horse,
if you enjoy flag waving and huzzas
for "Old Glory," and if you think
highly of Walter Huston, then this
picture is good.
The story, sometimes a bit far
fetched, is built around the United
States Army and its legends, and,
aided by shots of Fort Myer, Vir
ginia, and the co-operation of the
16th Field Artillery, presents an in
teresting and true-to-life picture of
army activities.
