# BULL SESSION
## THE 						GAME OF TAG 
### 
In days of old, men were quar- j
j tered, drawn, and hamstrung for
] stealing loaves of bread. Capital
j punishment was dished out as freely
i as cigars at a political convention.
I Most men never had a chance to be
come habitual offenders. They did
i not last that long.
But the dear old Constitution
' changed all that. "Cruel or unusual"
! fines and penalties were prohibited.
| It was at this stage that the insti
! tution of TRAFFIC TAGS made its j
j first appearance. These which
come in blue, green, white, and al
most any color (but smell just as
bad in any color), have been tra
! ditionally followed up by money
! fines or "10 days in jail."
I Along with a few of the more
progressive towns in America, Palo
| Alto instituted the "woodpile" as
| the place where traffic violators
i could work off fines—and work up .
I blisters, perspiration, and knotty bi- ;
; ceps. Stanford's feminine lawbreak
i ers, quite indisposed to wield axes,
; have been armed with knitting
i needles instead.
i Many have condemned the "wood- j
J pile" as being both "cruel and un
i usual." But the majority, who have
' been faced with wobbly bankrolls,
j decided that in comparison to money
j fines, the "woodpile" was "kind ana
! unusual." In the great march of
j progress, through the thick mists of \

conservatism and chaos, Stanford
has fallen behind liberal Palo Alto.
Stanford speeders and wrong-park
ers, who choose to commit their sins
on campus, still have no choice. They
must pay up—perhaps not immedia
tely—but inevitably. That is neither
right nor desirable.
The advantage of the "woodpile"
of the Convalescent Home as; pun
ishment for violators is enormous.
It is morp fair. The rough with a
small income has almost the same
debt-paying power as the man with
a large income. To the man earning
his way through college, a money
fine is almost in the class of the
"cruel and unusual." Further, pay
ment through labor is a greater spur
to obedience for a greater number
of people than is payment through
dollars. The Stanford plutocrat who
can slap down a wad of greenback*
without a murmur is not affected i..
the slightest by the fine. Ho would
be affected by blisters and back
aches.
If Stanford is intent on traffic law
observance, hours of work at the
Convalescent Home should be made
at least a form of fine. If Stanford is
interested in wheedling Stanford
students, the present system is ex
cellent. —Dave Mellirikoff

debt-paying power as the man with
a large income. To the man earning
his way through college, a money
fine is almost in the class of the
"cruel and unusual." Further, pay

Convalescent Home should be made
