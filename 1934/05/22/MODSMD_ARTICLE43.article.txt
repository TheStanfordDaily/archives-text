THE GALLERY
GETS A TREAT
No one can say that the crippled
senior team did not do its best in the
women's freshman-senior swimming
'oeet. Amid applause from the gal
hry the two-man relay team cheer
fully, even laughingly, combined
with track, as Mary Ann Crary and
Anna Louise Aynesworth qualified
by swimming a lap and running
around the pool to be ready for the
next lap. Fatigued but game, Crary
/ook her last leap into an empty pool.
Jean Albertson helped the fresh
men win the meet by qualifying for
ihe plunge at the last moment, an
other unexpected event.
EXPERIENCE
IN OFFICIATING
The meets are being managed ex
clusively by the women, timing and
all. The diving was judged by the
class in technique of teaching .swim
ming. The meets have been very
official with valuable experience
gained.
The diving exhibitions of Tom
Booth have been much appreciated
jy the women's class. Heretofore
Boothe have been much appreciated
Boothe has been volunteering his
help every Saturday at 11 o'clock,
with great success. It is hoped that
the same success will attend the class
on Tuesday at 5 o'clock, taking the
place of the Saturday hour.
IMPROVING
TOGETHER
The dancing classes are grateful to
Beau Kitselman for his accompani
ments. His strong touch and im
provisations lend a pleasing rhythih
and a new interest to the dance
t'- hich would be quite impossible
without his assistance since the
treasury is empty and he kindly
.stepped into the breach.
Kitselman and Shelley Smith are
combining their talents in a new
number, Smith rounding out .some
lovely ideas of her own.
ARCHERY MEET
FINISHES WELL
Although hampered by heavy wind
and the consciousness of first time in
competition for five of the eight con
testants in the Intercollegiate Tele
graphic Archery Shoot, Stanford
women showed a marked improve
ment over last year, with a team
score of 2,378 out of 472 hits as
against the previous year's 2,194 out
of 436.
Kathleen Thorburn turned in a
score%of 458 with 70 hits, certain to
get a gold medal. Last year she shot
446. It will not be known until the
".tst of June what place Stanford
won or where Thorburn stands in
dividually, but tlit* prospects are
line. Thirty-four colleges are com
peting, with Stanford hoping for
tenth place, having made fourteenth
in last year's competition. Good
grounds for hoping is the fact the
' iwest. score made this year is above
the three lowest of last year.
Winona Woon, who shot 339 out
of 65, and Judith Boyle, who shot
325 out of 59, are assured of some
award, probably a bronze medal.
Both have done better in practice, as
have many of the others, a source of
disappointment, but it is a good
showing, nevertheless. Aggravating
also to some is that they shot better
scores immediately after turning in
their figures for competition.
Following are the scores for the
others, who were in competition for
the first time: Margaret Brown made
'">3 out of 59; Mildred King, 272 out
of 60 hits; Ethel Brown, 246 out of
56; Elinor Kahn, 236 out of 52; and
Alice Cocn, 229 out of 51.

THE GALLERY
GETS A TREAT
No one can say that the crippled
senior team did not do its best in the
women's freshman-senior swimming
'oeet. Amid applause from the gal
hry the two-man relay team cheer
fully, even laughingly, combined
with track, as Mary Ann Crary and
Anna Louise Aynesworth qualified
by swimming a lap and running
around the pool to be ready for the
next lap. Fatigued but game, Crary
/ook her last leap into an empty pool.
Jean Albertson helped the fresh
men win the meet by qualifying for
ihe plunge at the last moment, an
other unexpected event.
EXPERIENCE
IN OFFICIATING
The meets are being managed ex
clusively by the women, timing and
all. The diving was judged by the
class in technique of teaching .swim
ming. The meets have been very
official with valuable experience
gained.
The diving exhibitions of Tom
Booth have been much appreciated
jy the women's class. Heretofore
Boothe have been much appreciated
Boothe has been volunteering his
help every Saturday at 11 o'clock,
with great success. It is hoped that
the same success will attend the class
on Tuesday at 5 o'clock, taking the
place of the Saturday hour.
IMPROVING
TOGETHER
The dancing classes are grateful to
Beau Kitselman for his accompani
ments. His strong touch and im
provisations lend a pleasing rhythih
and a new interest to the dance
t'- hich would be quite impossible
without his assistance since the
treasury is empty and he kindly
.stepped into the breach.
Kitselman and Shelley Smith are
combining their talents in a new
number, Smith rounding out .some
lovely ideas of her own.
ARCHERY MEET
FINISHES WELL
Although hampered by heavy wind
and the consciousness of first time in
competition for five of the eight con
testants in the Intercollegiate Tele
graphic Archery Shoot, Stanford
women showed a marked improve
ment over last year, with a team
score of 2,378 out of 472 hits as
against the previous year's 2,194 out
of 436.
Kathleen Thorburn turned in a
score%of 458 with 70 hits, certain to
get a gold medal. Last year she shot
446. It will not be known until the
".tst of June what place Stanford
won or where Thorburn stands in
dividually, but tlit* prospects are
line. Thirty-four colleges are com
peting, with Stanford hoping for
tenth place, having made fourteenth
in last year's competition. Good
grounds for hoping is the fact the
' iwest. score made this year is above
the three lowest of last year.
Winona Woon, who shot 339 out
of 65, and Judith Boyle, who shot
325 out of 59, are assured of some
award, probably a bronze medal.
Both have done better in practice, as
have many of the others, a source of
disappointment, but it is a good
showing, nevertheless. Aggravating
also to some is that they shot better
scores immediately after turning in
their figures for competition.
