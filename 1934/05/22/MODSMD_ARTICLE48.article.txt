# STANFORD POLOISTS WIN FROM BLACK-FOXE, 8-5
## 
### 
Stanford's fast riding poloists yes
terday ended a season marred by
only two defeats When they won
over the Black Foxe Military Acad
emy riders, by a score of 8 to 5.
The same four who rode for the
first time together Saturday when
they defeated the visitors 4 to 2
played again yesterday, and again it
was the two veterans, Luppe Luppen
and Bill Rogers, who did most of the
scoring, Luppen accounting for four
tallies and Rogers for three.
Bill Enemark added the other In
dian goal, and Jim Henderson com
pleted the four. Both have played
second string all year until these
last two games, but showed plenty
of ability as mallet wielders yester
day.
Outstanding for Black Foxe was
•Barneson, who scored both goals in
the first game, and two yesterday.
From the point of view of goals

scored, however, the most valuable
player the southerners had was
Frankie Burns, a second string Stan
ford rider. Burns rode in place of
Cypler of the visiting team, whose
infected foot kept him on the ground,
and the Indian rider accounted for
three of their goals.
Bob Fullerton and Russ Rasmus
sen, the two first string riders kept
out of the Stanford lineup to give
Enemark and Henderson a chance,
acted as referees.
A slightly different lineup was
used by Black Foxe yesterday, with
Yellott at one, Foxe at two, Barneson
at three, and Burns at back. For
Stanford, Enemark rode at one, Lup
pen at two, Rogers at three, and
Henderson at back.
