Winners of the two $25 prize
awards offered by the English Club
in connection with the publication
of the 1934 "Yearbook of Stanford
Writing" were announced at a spe
cial publication banquet last Friday
evening. Barbara Gibbs, well-known
local poetess, won the prize for the
best poetry in the book, while Al
bert Guerard, Jr., was awarded the
prize for the best prose. Both of
them have published widely on and
off the campus.
The prize-winning selections in the
opinion of the three judges were
Miss Gibbs' sonnet, "First Love,"
and Mr. Guerard's story, "Davos in
Winter." These are collected in the
