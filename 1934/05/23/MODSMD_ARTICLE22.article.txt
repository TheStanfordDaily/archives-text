# Rest Homes Are Evidence Of Mother's Club Service
## 
### 
Phone calls from as far away as
New York, and many letters of ap
preciation which are being received
continually from grateful parents as
well as students, arc evidence of the
helpful service which is being ren
dered by the Stanford Mothers' Club
through the Rest Homes.
During the past college year,
Mothers' Club has put $1,694.81 into
these homes, and during the six
years since the founding has con
tributed approximately $10,000. Each
year a spring garden fete is given
to raise funds to go toward the sup
port of the homes during the next
year. This fete is being given in the,
Paul Shoup Gardens in Los Altos |
this afternoon.
These homes, one for men and one
for women, were started in October,
1928, by Mrs. Edwin J. Thomas, then •
president of Mothers' Club, together
with a group of mothers. The pur
pose was to meet certain health,
problems not solved by existing uii
versity agencies.
Formerly eases in which the stu

dent was not ill enough to go to the
hospital or wa* recovering from an
illness and had been dismissed from
the hospital were taken care of
through volunteer care offered by
mothers living in the vicinity of the
campus. With the organization of
the Rest Homes it was felt that a
larger number of students would
feel free to enter for convalescent
care.
At the Men's Rest Home main
tained by Mrs. H. C. Carr at 1117
Hamilton Avenue, 151 men were
taken care of for a total of 468 days.
At the Women's Rest Home on the
campus, Mrs. J. L. Owen cared for
207 women for a total of 824 days.
Good food, quiet surroundings, and
friendly care are provided at both
to help offset the tension of campus
life and to restore exhausted nerves.
Mrs. Paul Shoup was one of the
original sponsors of the Homos and
has continued her interest in them.
The spring tea in the gardens of her
Los Altos home has become an an
nual event of steadily increasing
popularity.
