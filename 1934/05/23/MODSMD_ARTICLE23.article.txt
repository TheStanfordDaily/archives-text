# Annual May Fete To Be Given Today
## Shoup Garden in Los Altos Provides Setting For Mothers' Affair Loud Speaker System Put In; Triolo To Officiate 
### 
Transformed into an International
Bazaar, the Paul Shoup Gardens in
Los Altos will be the scene of the
annual Mothers' Club May Fete from
2 to 5:00 o'clock this afternoon.
As guests of honor six foreign
consuls and their wives will be pres
ent. An exceptionally large crowd
is expected since over 700 tickets
have been sold. Tickets may be ob
tained at the A.S.S.U. offices or at
the affair for 50 cents apiece.
Triolo to Aid
Yell Leader Jimmy Triolo, aided
by a loud speaker system, will act
as master of ceremonies. He will
keep everyone informed of the time
and place of the varied entertain
ment features which are to be pre
sented during the afternoon.
Among these features are a skit
exposing life in the Mauve Decade
(to be given in costume of the pe
riod), various musical and vocal
performances by Stanford students,
and typically national features which
the booths representing the six na
tions, Russia, France, Germany,
Spain, the Orient, and America, will
offer.
Free Refreshments
About 50 Stanford women will
serve during the afternoon free re
freshments to all attending. This
will consist of coffee and cookies.
Delicacies of the six nations will
be on sale at the national booths.
Typical costumes of the country will
be worn by those serving in them.
Among the foods will be Viennese
apple strudle, French soup put up in
jars, Japanese flower teas and se
same cookies, Russian meat pies,
and Mrs. A. L. Trowbridge's famous
enchiladas.
Russian Chorus
The Russian booth will be dis
tinguished by a chorus of 20 cos
tumed singers, trained by Paul
Shulgrin, formerly of Dresden, and
a ballet danced by Joan Taylor,
daughter of Professor and Mrs. C. V.
Taylor.
Although signs will direct the mo
torists through Los Altos to the
scene of festivities, the following di
rections will insure proper arrival.
Follow the main highway to the Los
Altos road. Once in the village of
Los Altos, cross the railroad tracks
and turn to the left on the first road.
The Shoup home is the ninth after
the turn.
