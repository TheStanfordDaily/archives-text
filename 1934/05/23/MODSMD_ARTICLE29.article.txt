group, was passed without opposition by the Ex Committee. A petition

'which was being circulated by Frank

handball, and wrestling were elimi
nated from the minor sports group,
and the classification of minor sports
as a name was eliminated from the

play one-fourth the time in the S.C.

made due to the valuations in the

Although changes were suggested
in the matter of awarding lettei's to
tennis players, action was left to Ihc

ton and Rufs Rasmussen, will not be
duplicated in the future, as the Ex
Committee ruled that freshmen
making a varsity Circle "o" team,
will receive a Circle number.

nated from the minor sports group,
and the classification of minor sports
as a name was eliminated from the
minor sports group and the official
title of Circle "S" sports substi
tuted. Likewise, the classification
of first and second class minor sports
was done away with, though all ap
preciable differences between the
two were retained.
Minor Changes
Minor changes in the by-laws con
sisted of changing the time required
in basketball and water polo to win
awards. Under the new provisions,
basketball men must play one-sixth
of the time in the series with Cali
fornia, and water polo men must
play one-fourth the time in the S.C.
or Cal games. These changes were
made due to the valuations in the
number of games with these two
colleges from year to year. Other re
quirements for earning the award.;
remain unchanged from the old by
laws.
Although changes were suggested
in the matter of awarding lettei's to
tennis players, action was left to Ihc
future js no constructive plans were
made.
Classification Made
Official Block "S" sports remain
under the new by-laws as baseball,
basketball, football, tennis, and track.
Circle "S" sports will be: boxing,
fencing, cross-country, golf, gymna
sium, horse polo, soccer, swimming,
and water polo.
The peculiar situation of freshmen
winning a Circle "S" in a minor spoi l
this year in horse polo: Bob Fuller
ton and Rufs Rasmussen, will not be
duplicated in the future, as the Ex
Committee ruled that freshmen
making a varsity Circle "o" team,
will receive a Circle number.
C ircJe "S" men who have earned their third award in one minor sport
will receive a Block "S" instead of their third award, it was decided by the
Ex Committee when they passed the Athletic By-laws to the new Consti
tution in their meeting last night.
This action, which has been the subject of agitation by the minor sports
group, was passed without opposition by the Ex Committee. A petition

'which was being circulated by Frank
Fullenwider to get a student vote
upon the by-laws, was dropped by
the Revision Committee member
when he saw that there was no opin
ion against the by-laws at the moot
ing.
No Ticket Privilege
With the block award for the third
year Circle "S" men, the B.A.U.
ticket privileges and the Block "S"
card will not be given under the new
by-laws.
At the same time rifle-shooting,
handball, and wrestling were elimi
nated from the minor sports group,
and the classification of minor sports
as a name was eliminated from the
minor sports group and the official
title of Circle "S" sports substi
tuted. Likewise, the classification
