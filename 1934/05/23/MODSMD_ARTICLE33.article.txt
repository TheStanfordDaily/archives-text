# Another Necessary Revision
## 
### 
f>n I of recent controversies lias come Iho fact thai the
Men's Council (at least) does not have the specific power
lo subpoena witnesses who may have relevant testimony
to give in the decision of any particular case.
Under the present setup, witnesses actually appear en
tirely of their own volition. This should not he the case.
The witnesses, according to flu 4 present constitutional
by-laws, which gradually are being revised, are not bound
to appear, except by the first sentence of Article V, Sec
tion 1 Men's and Women's Councilsâ€”which says: "The
councils for student control shall have such jurisdiction
over all cases of a disciplinary nature pertaining to the
student body of Stanford University as is granted to stu
dent government by the President of the University."
Obviously, that is too broad a definition -characteristic
of. the constitution and by-laws which have been, and are
being, changed. Squabbles which have arisen in the past
year particularly are sufficient for warranting the
demand that .specific duties and powers be defined in the
new A.S.S.I*, constitution and by-laws. Here is a chance
for the revisions committee to do some really constructive
work.
While the President of the University is granting juris
diction of council cases to the students, and while the coun
cils are granted "such jurisdiction" by the old constitution,
there is nothing which can force material witnesses to
appear before these bodies.
If the Daily interprets the actions of the President cor
rectly, the Administration is anxious to have students de
cide their own problems. In some cases, it has proven
necessary that the advice of older and more experienced
people is necessary for the fairness of a decision. That is
justifiable.
Therefore, if students are to decide their own problems,
they must have definite rules upon which to base their
decisions. The revisions can clear up future distasteful
situations by drawing up specific laws for the guidance
of the councils and for the best solution of problems which
the councils are attempting to handle.
