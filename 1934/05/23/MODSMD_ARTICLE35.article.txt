# WHY IT'S NEWS
## Darrow, Johnson, and the NRA 
### CROMPTON BANGS Jr 
PURPOSE OF THE
REVIEW BOARD
The Blue Eagle has led a hard life
for so young a bird. Senator Borah
has done his best to bedevil General
Johnson and his pet. Last winter
when anti-NRA criticism reached a
new high, F.R. appointed a Review
Board to look into charges that the
NRA was fostering monopoly and
squeezing out the "little fellow." The
President did this to please Borah.
To head the board, he chose famed
Lawyer Clarence Darrow, perennial
champion of the underdog.
WHAT IT
DID—ANI) DIDN'T
The board got to work, gathered
evidence and had its report in the
President's hands over two months
ago. Yet not a word of it leaked out
until this week. There were distinct
rumors that the Blue Eagle had been
put on the frying pan, and that John
son lacked the irttestinal fortitude to
publish it at the time.
The fact that both the Review
Board's report and the NRA answer
were published at the same time lend
plenty of support to this idea. Had
the Darrow blast been released in
March it would have created a na
tional sensation. As things are now
its effects are milder when answered
in parallel columns.
WHAT DARROW
SAYS ABOUT NRA
Harrow's board found what it ex
pected to find. The "little fellow*

was being forced to the wall, con- j
sumers were being scalped, monop- j
oly was growing rapidly. The noted
lawyer saw only two possible solu
tions: (1) Monopoly sustained by the
Government—the NRA trend; (2)
planned economy—meaning govern- .
ment ownership and control. Dar
row felt that it was wrong for the
U.S. to guarantee profits to industry
and take it out of the hides of labor
and consumers.
JOHNSON'S
REPLY
The NRA administrator was really \
sore. He accused Darrow of being j
a publicity seeker and recommended |
that hi.s board be abolished. John- 1
son claimed Darrow's report placed i
the choice solely between Commun
ism and Fascism—both impossible j
in America.
WHAT
ABOUT IT?
Regardless of what the choice will
be, Darrow is right in saying that the
NRA has failed to do what it set out
to do. The whole incident shows
that Harrow—an inexperienced jour
nalist but an experienced lawyer— 1
was taken for a ride by the Demo- i
J l
crats.
This may turn out to be one of
F.R.'s biggest mistakes; the Repub
licans are already using the reports
as campaign material—in spite of its j
open advocacy of government own
ership. It's foolish to muffle criti
cism; it's likely to bounce back I
stronger than ever.
