WE'RE NOT DRESSING
| (Paramount)
At the Mountain View Theatre
If you happen to be (a) a Bing
: Crosby fan, (b) in a very good hu-
I mor, you will enjoy thi.s film very
j much. If noi, it will appeal to you
as the routine single-player film
! with much ado about very little.
It is the usual story of the sailor
j who wins the heart of the heiress on
| whose yacht he labors, when the two
I are cast on a desert island and the
| gentleman assumes responsibility.
The present instance avoids the ac
i cusation of being a filch from "The
Admirable Crichton" by confessing,
i halfway through, that the circum
■ stances are like those in the Barrie
| play. But a filch is a filch in any
j struggle.
However, it is a highly entertain
ing picture, and pleasant through-
I out. Crosby sings more than the
| usual number of songs, and some of
| them are excellent tunes, notably,
; "May I" and "Love Thy Neighbor."
| His acting, as usual, is negligible,
I but his personality gets the picture
I over.
Burns and Allen go through some
| more of their antics, and are as
, funny as ever—which is very funny.
Carole Lombard does an indifferent
i heroine, and Leon Carrol and Ethel
Merman appear in comedy support,
I as does a very charming black bear
j named Droopy. —Chapin
LADY FOR A DAY (Columbia)
and
BE MINE TONIGHT (Universal)
At the California Theatre
A revival of either of these pic
j tures is,important, and revived to
i gether they make an Event.
"Lady for a Day" is the film, one
! of the ten best of last year, which
| won May Robson the position of
; runner-up for the- best performance
of the year. It was directed by
| Frank Capra, who directed "It Hap
; pened One Night," and is altogether
I one of the finest things that has ever
J come to the screen.
"Be Mine Tonight" is the foreign
j made musical starring Jan Kiepuru
which set all manner of records
j wherever it was shown. Light in
i plot, charming in music and singing,
I and beautiful in scenic and photo
graphic effects, it is a delightful film.
