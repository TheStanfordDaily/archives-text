AIRLINES—One of the paradoxi
cal twists of popular music is evi
denced by Harry Barris' new or
chestra, now broadcasting regularly
over KGO.
Barris. one of the country's best
song writers, seems unable to apply
to an orchestra the melodic beauty
and danceable rhythms he has ob
tained in his numerous song suc
cesses.
His experience as one of the orig
inal Rhyfhm Boys, who were fea
tured with the Whiteman and Arn- j
heim organizations, has stood him in |
good stead as long as he confined his ;
activities to "plugging" songs, but
his sense of musical balance deserts
him the moment he tries to oi'ganize
a dance band.
His first attempt at organizing a
band occurred in New York two or
three years ago. The band was not
a success and Barris broke up the
organization and returned to Cali
fornia and Gus Arnheim.
His new orchestra seems destined i
to follow the first one unless con
siderable improvement is made, al
though it is just possible that the
Barris personality, in combination
with Loyce Whiteman's singing, may I
put the organization across.
