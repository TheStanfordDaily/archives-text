# BULL SESSION
## THE
						SHORT END FOR THE LONGSHOREMEN 
### 
A small log of very rare wood is
■ floating in the river. It is so very
light that it will just barely support
; the weight of a struggling man who
j clutches to that bit of wood to save
1 himself from drowning.
Also in the river is a boat; and in
the boat is a collector of rare woods.
1 The man in the boat has a grudge
against the man in the river, and so
j he will not save him. The man who
] rides safely in the boat and the man
: who clutches fiercely at the log—
j are united in but one thing: they
i both want the precious chunk of
wood.
The collector of rare woods would
i use his strength to push the man off
| the log, but for fear that he might
I capsize his boat in the melee. And
1 so the collector—secure in his com
; fortable boat — suggests to the
drowning man, that since both want
the log, a compromise is the only
1 fair solution to their difficulty: they
j should split the log between them.
{ To this suggestion the water-soaked
, man retors with a wild shriek of
j laughter. He refuses to compromise,
! for if he gives up the smallest part
iof the log, his doom is certain. He
will sink.
And so the man in the river
clutches his log still closer; and the
man in the boat waits —and calls
the other man a "poor sport" and an

, "uncompromising rascal."
Longshoremen all up and down
the Pacific Coast are holding firmly
to demands for recognition of their
union, higher wages, and shorter
hours. If they yield on the issues at
stake, they are deliberately acquiesc
ing to the action which will sink
: them further and further into an
existence, miserable at best.
\ The ship-owners, too, claim that
they cannot compromise: that their
' business will suffer if they yield
further. But for the ship-owners to
! compromise means merely to forego
I an extra decimal point on a bulging
j bank roll. For the longshoremen to
| compromise means consenting to a
l plan that denies their children of
decent food, and themselves of the
bare necessities of life.
There is nothing sacrosanct about
the word COMPROMISE. What is
important in compromise, is sacri
j fice. If the ship-owners are willing
to sacrifice an amount of comfort
1 proportionate to what they ask their
employees to sacrifice, the Strike will
be over in 10 minutes.
Rev. Father James O'Kelly of the
"Apostle Ship of the Sea," 226 Em
| barcadero, S.F., is receiving con
tributions to give food to the strik
j ing longshoremen.
