"When we get to England we fee]
as though we had returned home."
So spoke George E. Stone, pioneer
in the field of visual education, who
talked last night in the Assembly
Hall on "The Charm of England."
Stone illustrated his lecture with
over 100 remarkable photographs
which he took two years ago when
he and his family toured England
for several months.
Rural Scenes Interest
England, with its quaint villages,
chalk cliffs, and pleasant rural scenes
unmarred by billboards, proved to
be very charming. Stone is particu
larly interested in British cathedrals,
and in the variety of themes and ex
pression which may be found in
(hem. It took hundreds of years to
complete some of these massive
cathedrals, and each may represent
two or three separate periods of
thought.
Many examples of the remnants
of Roman civilization were shown,
among them Stonehenge and Had
rian's Wall. In Lincoln, an English
town, stands a portion of an old Ro
man aqueduct, under which modern
automobiles and bicycles now pass.
Dickens' Inn Noted
The old inn where Dickens' jovial
Mr. Pickwick had many interesting
adventures was pictured, as was the
spot where the blind Milton wrote
"Paradise Lost." Stone showed beau
tiful pictures of the Shakespeare
country and the Lake Region where
Wordsworth and other nature poets
found inspiration for their poetry.
Stone is secretary of the Visual
Education Service, a non-profit or
ganization incorporated in 1927 and
dedicated to the use of photography
and graphic illustrations in educa
tion.
Stone lectured in the World War
to soldiers in the army camps. Since
the war he has continued his work
in both biology and photography,
and has traveled throughout the
world making many films and slides.
