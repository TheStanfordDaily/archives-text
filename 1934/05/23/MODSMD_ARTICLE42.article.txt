# CAMPUS OPINION
## BOOST, DON'T KNOCK 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I noticed in the Bull Session that
American education and even Stan
ford education trains college stu
dents to be misfits. How ridiculous!
It is plain to anyone with a grain of
sense that Stanford does not make
misfits, but trains men for life. Look
at Herbert Hoover.
Furthermore, 1 understand that
Stanford debaters are taking the af
firmative of a resolution to the effect
thjit English education fits a man lor
life better than American education.
It is certainly too bad that the sides
in the debates could not be reversed
to allow American students to de
fend American institutions. Last
year in Canada Stanford students
said that America was to blame for
the present world chaos. Why can't
debaters come out of it and start
boosting instead of knocking? What
is debating supposed to do for one,
anyway? Very trully yours,
