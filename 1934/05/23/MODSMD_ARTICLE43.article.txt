# SENIORS PLANNING FOR ANNUAL BALL JUNE 15 IN TOYON
## 
### 
Having received a date from the
Executive Committee, approval of
their list of chaperones from Dean
Mary Yost, and inspiration from a
glowing Stanford tradition of past
balls, the Senior Ball committee has
consummated most of its plans for
the Class of '34's final fling.
On Friday, June 15, Toyon Hall's
much-trod but still sprightly lobby
will be the setting for this year's
Senior Ball. Dancing from 10 to
4:30 o'clock in the morning, and
breakfast served shortly before the
closing hour, will again feature the
event.
The Ball committee, headed by
Dick Gould, approved an Inner Quad
motif. No contract for the decora
tions has been let.
Always the peak of Stanford's so
cial season, the Senior Ball has de
manded and obtained as much as $10
per bid. Last year the bids were $7.
This year's price has not been defi
nitely determined, but will be no
higher than the 1933 low and prob
ably will be less.
No decision concerning the orches
tra has been reached. Dick Miles,
head of the sub-committee in charge
of the orchestra, is corresponding
with eastern booking agents and
business manager?, and the commit
tee probably will reach a decision
soon.
Although the Ball is three and
one-half weeks away, the Ball com
mittee is already completely organ
ized and has been working on the
project for a fortnight. The rush for
bids will start on June 1.
