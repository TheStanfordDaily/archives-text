INDIAN HANDFUL
VS. YALE ARMY
There may be strength in num- ,
bers. We'll tell you better next Sat- j
urday night. At present, however, j
California in general is hoping the ,
many will give way to the few in ,
the 1.C.4-A. struggle for track su- i
premucy in Philadelphia this week
end.
According to some kind of natural
law, Stanford seems all too optimis
tic in matching a handful of seven I
against an army of 72 Yale stars on j
anywhere near an even basis. And !
California undoubtedly appears to j
Easterners as a bit self-important j
in claiming a chance for third or |
fourth place with her tiny band of i
five.
COULDN'T DO
BETTER AT HOME
But if the meet were to be held
right in the Stanford Stadium, and j
if every student enrolled on the j
Farm could enter, the •chances are |
the Cardinal point total would be j
merely an accumulation of places j
earned by those same seven.
True, a few Indian track men were I
left home who would have had a !
chance of placing back East. Carlton i
Thorns might have sneaked in for a 1
fourth or fifth in .the 100, Lloyd 1
Schween or Howie Arthur might j
have been capable of gathering a
point or two in the high jump, or j
Paul Zaches might have leaped to a j
place in the broad jump.
But even these few points would |
be exceedingly doubtful. Last year, !
after a more successful season than j
this, Schween jumped only six feet]
in the 1.C.4-A.; Zaches failed to I
qualify in his event.
So if Stanford's seven bow to'
Yale's 72, Farm backers will have no
kick coming as far as numbers are
concerned.
SOME POINTS SURE.
OTHERS DOUBTFUL
In that Indian group of seven as it
begins aclimating itself in Philadel- |
phia today are contained some of
the most certain and some of the
least certain points of any in the :
meet.
As for the sure-fire points, nearly <
all experts rate Johnny Lyman little
short of a cinch to capture the shot
put. He is probably the outstanding
favorite of any in the meet. Right ,
behind Lyman is the eyes of favor- '
ite-pickers appears John Mottram, !
unanimously claimed a standout j
choice for first, or at worst second,
in the javelin.
Sam Klopstock, although taking j
on a job that many sophomores j
would balk at, is as close to a cinch j
lor points in both the high and low t
hurdles as anyone can be in the \
Iricky and perilous barrier events.
ALMOST ANYTHING
COULD HAPPEN
But a lot of "ifs" are dogging the j
other four. Bud Deacon can win the J
pole vault with a new world's rec- j
ord, if He can also fail to place, |
if And he is just as-apt to do 1
one as the other.
Slinger Dunn, believed to be on J
ihc way up to his old discus form, I
may not be far enough along the j
grade by Saturday. Chuck Nimmo :
may fall into a flock of trouble in J
the 800 meters. Because of the com
petition in the mile, the slim sopho- (
more is concentrating his efforts on !
the shorter trek, and if his lack of
experience in this race causes him i
to misjudge his pace as he did against I
Elroy Robinson of Fresno State, he j
may not even qualify for Saturday's J
finals.
A1 Blackman's chances of a place j
in the 400 meters are good, but he j
may do anything in the 200. The
latter race will not interfere with
his primary interest, because activity
in the 400 both days will be com
pleted before the furlong begins.

There may be strength in num- ,
bers. We'll tell you better next Sat- j
urday night. At present, however, j
California in general is hoping the ,
many will give way to the few in ,
the 1.C.4-A. struggle for track su- i
premucy in Philadelphia this week
end.
According to some kind of natural
law, Stanford seems all too optimis
tic in matching a handful of seven I
against an army of 72 Yale stars on j
anywhere near an even basis. And !
California undoubtedly appears to j
Easterners as a bit self-important j
in claiming a chance for third or |
fourth place with her tiny band of i
five.
COULDN'T DO
BETTER AT HOME
But if the meet were to be held
right in the Stanford Stadium, and j
if every student enrolled on the j
Farm could enter, the •chances are |
the Cardinal point total would be j
merely an accumulation of places j
earned by those same seven.
True, a few Indian track men were I
left home who would have had a !
chance of placing back East. Carlton i
Thorns might have sneaked in for a 1
fourth or fifth in .the 100, Lloyd 1
Schween or Howie Arthur might j
have been capable of gathering a
point or two in the high jump, or j
Paul Zaches might have leaped to a j
place in the broad jump.
But even these few points would |
be exceedingly doubtful. Last year, !
after a more successful season than j
this, Schween jumped only six feet]
in the 1.C.4-A.; Zaches failed to I
qualify in his event.
So if Stanford's seven bow to'
Yale's 72, Farm backers will have no
kick coming as far as numbers are
concerned.
SOME POINTS SURE.
OTHERS DOUBTFUL
In that Indian group of seven as it
begins aclimating itself in Philadel- |
phia today are contained some of
the most certain and some of the
least certain points of any in the :
meet.
As for the sure-fire points, nearly <
all experts rate Johnny Lyman little
short of a cinch to capture the shot
put. He is probably the outstanding
favorite of any in the meet. Right ,
behind Lyman is the eyes of favor- '
ite-pickers appears John Mottram, !
unanimously claimed a standout j
choice for first, or at worst second,
in the javelin.
Sam Klopstock, although taking j
on a job that many sophomores j
would balk at, is as close to a cinch j
lor points in both the high and low t
hurdles as anyone can be in the \
Iricky and perilous barrier events.
ALMOST ANYTHING
COULD HAPPEN
But a lot of "ifs" are dogging the j
other four. Bud Deacon can win the J
pole vault with a new world's rec- j
ord, if He can also fail to place, |
if And he is just as-apt to do 1
one as the other.
Slinger Dunn, believed to be on J
ihc way up to his old discus form, I
may not be far enough along the j
grade by Saturday. Chuck Nimmo :
may fall into a flock of trouble in J
the 800 meters. Because of the com
