cilitate handling of the competition,
but entries will continue to be taken
on the sign-up sheet on the intra
mural bulletin board in Encina gym
until Friday.
Competition promises to be close
with a number of outstanding Indian
athletes having already entered.
Johnny Mottram and Bud Deacon,
both in the East with the track team
for the 1.C.4-A. meet, signified their
intention of entering before leaving.
Since they will not return until next
Wednesday, they will be allowed to
take their tests upon their return.
Variety of Shorts
Among others who have entered
are Gordy Mallatratt, varsity bas
ketball and baseball player; Jimmy
Willson, varsity sprinter; Robin
Lindsey, varsity basketball; Frank
Fullenwider, former varsity quarter
miler; Jim Trompas, varsity foot
ball; Rusty March, frosh track; Paul

So far every major sport but ten
nis is represented while few of the
minor sports athletes have entered.
Track and basketball seem to have
contributed the greatest number of
entrants. Since the decathlon is de
signed to pick as nearly as possible
the best all-around athlete at Stan
ford it is desired that men from all
sports enter as well as men who have
not competed on varsity or frosh
teams, but play merely for sport.
