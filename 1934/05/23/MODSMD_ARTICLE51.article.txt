# CARD, BEAR STARS REACH SCENE OF I.C.4-A. TODAY
## 
### 
Stanford's little group of seven '
athletes, favored over some 50 East
ern track and field teams in the In
tercollegiate A.A.A.A. meet Friday
and Saturday, will arrive in Phila
delphia this morning and begin lim
bering up for the last Cardinal ap
pearance in the annual cinder path
classic.
Stanford's team :s completing the
Eastern trip in company with an
even smaller West Coast representa
tive totalling five members from
Berkeley. The Bears and Cardinals
are the only Western hopes in the
annual meet.
To these 12 men will go respon
sibility of maintaining California su
premacy in the event. In 11 years,
Stanford, California, and U.S.C. have
divided 10 victories, the other going
to Yale, co-favorites with "Dink"
Templeton's Indians for this year's
title.
California and Stanford are col-«
lectively "pointing" at any and all
Eastern entries this week-end. And
all Eastern representatives are col
lectively pointing for the Bears and
Cardinals, all of which is figured to
add a certain interest.
Following Faculty Athletic Com
mittee action that Stanford shall not
enter an 1.C.4-A. meet after this
year, Templeton and his group of
seven re-doubled their preparaiion
to make this final year one to re
member.
On the other hand, the East re
doubled attempts to prevent a Farm
win when it received the report that

Stanford "didn't like their old
meet."
More Card spirit has been aroused
by the fact that the East, generally
speaking, has shown signs of smug
conceit over Columbia's upset vic
tory over the Indians in last Janu
ary's Rose Bowl football game.
So California-Stanford rivalry will
be forgotten in a common cause, and
12 Westerners will go through Stiff
workouts this afternoon, under di
rection of Templeton and Brutus
Hamilton.
Bud Deacon, pole vaulter, is the
only Card star who will not be called
on for competition until Saturday.
Trial heats will be run oft' Friday in
every race except the mile and two
mile and qualifications are sched
uled for the first day in the weights
and broad jump.
A1 Blackman will run a heat in tlje
400 meters early in Friday's program.
This will permit him to enter a 200-
meter trial later in the day without
endangering his chances in the
longer run.

Trial heats will be run oft' Friday in
every race except the mile and two
mile and qualifications are sched
uled for the first day in the weights
and broad jump.
A1 Blackman will run a heat in tlje
400 meters early in Friday's program.
This will permit him to enter a 200-
meter trial later in the day without
endangering his chances in the
longer run.
Stanford's little group of seven '
athletes, favored over some 50 East
ern track and field teams in the In
tercollegiate A.A.A.A. meet Friday
and Saturday, will arrive in Phila
delphia this morning and begin lim
bering up for the last Cardinal ap
pearance in the annual cinder path
classic.
Stanford's team :s completing the
Eastern trip in company with an
even smaller West Coast representa
tive totalling five members from
Berkeley. The Bears and Cardinals
are the only Western hopes in the
annual meet.
To these 12 men will go respon
sibility of maintaining California su
premacy in the event. In 11 years,
Stanford, California, and U.S.C. have
divided 10 victories, the other going
to Yale, co-favorites with "Dink"
Templeton's Indians for this year's
title.
California and Stanford are col-«
lectively "pointing" at any and all
Eastern entries this week-end. And
all Eastern representatives are col
lectively pointing for the Bears and
Cardinals, all of which is figured to
add a certain interest.
Following Faculty Athletic Com
mittee action that Stanford shall not
enter an 1.C.4-A. meet after this
year, Templeton and his group of
seven re-doubled their preparaiion
to make this final year one to re
member.
On the other hand, the East re
doubled attempts to prevent a Farm
win when it received the report that

Stanford "didn't like their old
meet."
More Card spirit has been aroused
by the fact that the East, generally
speaking, has shown signs of smug
conceit over Columbia's upset vic
tory over the Indians in last Janu
ary's Rose Bowl football game.
So California-Stanford rivalry will
be forgotten in a common cause, and
12 Westerners will go through Stiff
workouts this afternoon, under di
rection of Templeton and Brutus
Hamilton.
Bud Deacon, pole vaulter, is the
only Card star who will not be called
on for competition until Saturday.
