# PHI BELTS PLAY A.T.O. IN MURAL TITLE CONTEST
## Pitchers, Hitters Matched Evenly in Today's Game 
### 
TODAY'S SOFTBALL SCHEDULE
A.T.O.'s vs. Phi Dolts, frosli baseball
field, !» o'clock.
Two undefeated teams, the Phi
Delts and the A.T.O.'s, will clash for
Ihe intramural softball championship
this afternoon at 5 o'clock on the
frosh football field. Each of these
nines has, in addition to its iine rec
ord, a good pitcher and several dan
gerous hitters; so the outcome is
doped as practically a toss-up.
The Phi Delts, however, should bo
conceded a slight edge, because of
their high-class play in Monday's
I'l-innihg 4-to-3 victory over the
strong D.U. outfit.
In previous wins over the Delts,
Kappa Sigs, and Phi Delta Phi's,
Don Greenlee turned in three well
pitched games. It is doubtful if the
A.T.O. batting attack is any better
than that of the D.U.'s, whom Green
lee held to three runs and five hits.
Arbuckle Good
Ernie Arbuckle of the A.T.O.'s is
also a capable hurler, however, hav
ing turned back the Betas, 8 to 5,
last week, as well as the Fiji, Phi
Sig, Los Arcos, and Delta Chi teams
in the regular schedule. The A.T.O.'s
hitting and fielding are considered
fully equal to the Phi Dells', and if
the latter nine wins, it will be
through Greenlee's superior mound
work. .
If the game goes into extra in
nings, the Phi Delts will have an ad
vantage, as they have pulled several
games out of the fire in the late
stages. The A.T.O.'s best chance for
a triumph lies in securing an early
lead by solving the slants of Don
Greenlee, the condition of whose
arm, after the long game Monday,
will greatly influence the outcome.
