# Juniors Meet Freshmen In Interclass Baseball
## 
### 
Opening the interclass baseball se
ries, the junior and freshmen teams
meet at 4 o'clock this afternoon on
the Sunken Diamond. Seniors and
sophomores were scheduled to open \
the series with a game Monday but I
it was postponed until next Monday, i
Captain Archie Zamloch's frosh
are favored largely because of the
fact that they have played together
throughout the season, while the
juniors have played as members or
reserves of the varsity squad. The'
Class of '35 won the championship
last year, defeating the Class of '36 in
the final game.
