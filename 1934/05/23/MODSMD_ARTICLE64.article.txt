# MODERN MUSIC NOT ODD SAYS COWELL AT ALLEN MUSICAL
## 
### 
"Good modern music isn't odd, but
modern auditors, without the proper
background, are." Thus reported
Composer Henry Cowell when a
group of modern recordings had
been received with mild amusement
by students and guests of Warren D.
Allen at the latter's home on Sunday
evening.
Mr. Cowell stated further that
modern music is the result of care
ful and logical development from the
classics. The reason it is misunder
stood is because the average musical

intellect lags more than a century
behind the art. Included amongst
\ the recordings were compositions by |
Chavez, the Mexican artist, and Wal- J
lingford Rigger, both outstanding I
| moderns.
Mr. Cowell played several of his
i own compositions, including "The
: Harp of Life," "Amiable Conversa- [
ticn," and "Avertisement." Mr. Co- j
' well's technique at the piano is most
! unusual, enabling him to attain re
! markable acoustic and aesthetic of- 1
1 fects.
