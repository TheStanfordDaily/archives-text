# Painting Indian Ruins-New Job for Chemists
## 
### GEORGE WILSON 
Preparations for the worldis most
I original painting job—that of coat
! ing the Indian ruins in Arizona—are
| being carried on at the Chemistry
i Building.
It all happened this way. Some
! time ago the Federal government
J made a national monument out of
the ruins at Chmi Grande, Arizona.
Many tourists were attracted, but
j as the years and sandstorms passed,
1 the ruins became more nearly coni
i plete wrecks.
The only possible way to save
| them, in their actual form, was to
j coat them with some protective sub
! stance, and in order to completely
j fill specifications, this substance had
i to stand up under sandstorms, water,
ice, and tourists, and at the same
time discolor the adobe as little as
possible.
Early this year a plant was built
i in back of the Chemistry labora
i tories. CWA funds were used until
i April, and then the National Forest
' Service took it over.
Fred T. Martius is in charge of
the operating of the plant, working

| under the direction of F. A. Kit
tridge, chief engineer with the Park
service in Palo Alto. The chemical
I and microscopic tests have been done
by Richard Wright and Bob Hoe,
; both research assistants in chem
istry here.
Sample bricks made up from
crumblings of the ruins are tested by
placing them in wind tunnel, turn-
I ing on a 60-mile-an-hour sand blast,
and then if there is anything left,
they are soaked, frozen, and heated
alternately, so that a 10-year desert
weathering takes place in a very
' short time.
After the tests are finished and
I the ruins painted, all that will be
needed is a salesman to advertise
i among the Indian villages.
