# Swain Gives Major Talk
## Last Lecture Will Cover Physical Sciences 
### 
| Dr. Robert Eckles Swain, executive I
head of the School of Physical Sci- j
ences and vice-president of the Uni
versity, will speak on "The Depart- i
ments of Physics and Chemistry" at
j 7:15 o'clock tonight in the Little \
i Theatre in the last major department |
j lecture of the year.
In his talk tonight Dr. Swain will :
stress the importance of proper j
training for persons intending to en- i
ter any vocation leading out from j
chemistry" or physics. He believes !
that the problem of finding men and I
women capable of teaching and j
doing academic research is always j
great and that there is always a de
mand for trained chemists in indus- ,
try.
| Dr. Swain, who returned Sunday j
] from a two months' trip in Europe, j
| believes that a new trend is appear- !
| ing in these two fields in that indus- j
! trial management is calling for men i
j trained in physics, chemistry, and
mathematics and also in business j
administration. He will explain this |
i theory at some length tonight.
Students who are serious minded, i
; hard-working, and have a definite ]
: objective are encouraged by Dr. i
, Swain to major in chemistry or
physics. He believes that there is a j
| much wider spread in the field of
I employment in the physical sciences
; than ever before and that they j
; should absorb a large number of ;
well-trained students in the future. !
Dr. Swain, who held the office of â– 
j president while Dr. Wilbur was in |
; Washington, has made it his objec- !
Live, upon returning to the Chemis- j
' try Department this year, to make 1
1 the acquaintance of every major and !
! upperclassman. He is proud of the
! fact that the department has been j
; able to place practically every grad- |
: uate they could recommend and
I takes it upon himself to help every
student doing research or who is
about to enter an outside field.
After graduating from Stanford
with an A.B. degree Dr. Swain ob
tained his M.S. and Ph.D. at Yale,
and his L.D. at the Cbllege of Pa
cific. He has studied at universities
abroad and lectured at Columbia
! University. He has been at Stan
ford since 1898.
