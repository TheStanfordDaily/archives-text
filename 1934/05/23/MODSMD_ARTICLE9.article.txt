. vs. Pvt. J. H. Davison" involving al
leged desertion from the army, in a
I moot court martial by Lt.-Col. D. C.
| Cubbison's class in military law.
j The case, written by Colonel Cub-
I bison, was correct to the minutest
detail with the involved witnesses
I even being assigned fictitious names,
i To lend further aspect of reality
j three regular officers of the local
I R.0.T.C., veterans of actual trials,
acted important positions on the
I court. Colonel Cubbison was court
{ president, Captain S. F. Miller acted
I as trial judge-advocate, or prose
| cuting attorney, and Captain I. A.
j Luke was the defense counsel.
I The court, who acted something
in the capacity of civil court, jury,
was composed of "Maj." J. 11. Graves,

i "Captains" G. S. Johnson, A. E.
Kehke, Edwin McCowan, G. K. Wy
man, Edward Doleman, and R. B.
Eaton as law member. The latter is

! lions.
A court martial in comparison
with civil court procedure, is no
ticeably quick and to the point with
all dramatic appeals and pleas to the
jury eliminated. Examination of wit
nesses is carried on in the usual
manner.
The case involved the alleged de
sertion of the accused, impersonated
by F. M. Robinson, from the Presidio
of San Francisco. He was picked up
iti Palo Alto two months later em
ployed in "Moos Bros." store. The
prosecution alleged the defendant
was, by virtue of his absence, a de
serter. The defense attempted to
show that he was only "absent with
out leave," which is technically not
the same as the serious charge of
desertion.
