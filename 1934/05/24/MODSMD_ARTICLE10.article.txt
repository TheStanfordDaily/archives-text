### ROGER KIMBALL 
"I would like to see the younger
i group some 'day become civic
! minded. I want to assure you that
i from our standpoint we're all ready
i and willing to accept you as part of
ourselves."
Thus spoke Leonard S. Leavy,
■ controller of the city and county of
San Francisco, at the weekly dinner
meeting held by the Graduate School
of Business Club in the Union last
night. Leavy considered in his ad
dress the problems of tax delin
quency and decrease in revenues
other than taxes as the main phases
in his work as manager of the finan
-1 ces of the bay metropolis.
Leavy read and elaborated upon a
| paper by Frederick L. Bird, entitled
• "The Four-Year Trend in Tax De
j linquency," including statistics prov-
I ing that many cities in San Fran
! Cisco's population class of over a
half million had experienced less
efficiency in tax collection.
In comparison to 7 per cent de
linquency for San Francisco during
the fiscal year 1932-33, New York
suffered 26 per cent, Chicago 41 per
cent, Philadelphia 27 per cent, Los
Angeles 13 per cent, and Buffalo 11
per cent, according lo llii.s report

The speaker also stated that the
number of unemployed persons in
San Francisco had been reduced
from 75,000 in March, 1933, to 25,000
last November
Remarking that San Francisco is
America's only consolidated city and
county, with the exceptions of Den
ver and territorial Honolulu, Leavy
recommended this unified form of
government Although he referred
to the bay city's municipal centra
lized control of political and eco
nomic city functions as "the finest
set-up in the country," the speaker
expressed regret concerning the du
plication of government and super
fluous numbers of offices in smail
towns in the bay district
Leavy stated that the municipal
pay-roll, exclusive of public school
employees, totaled more than $20,-
000,000, but that saving in excess of
$430,000 had been made since 1932.
Adding a touch of humor in this
connection, Leavy remarked that
this generation would have been glad
to graduate out of any kind of a
building, and that now, in hk office,
he was the only California man, and
he wondered why the Stanford men
didn't couiu to .see liiiii mure.
