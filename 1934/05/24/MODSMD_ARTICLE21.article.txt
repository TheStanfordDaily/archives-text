## Final Discussion Features Chemistry, Physics 
### 
In the fourteenth and last lecture
j in this year's major department se
! ries, Dr. Robert Eckles Swain, exec
! utive head of the School of Physical
I Sciences, last night spoke on the de
| partments of physics and chemistry
j to a group of 50 persons in the Lit
tle Theatre.
j Emphasized in Dr. Swain's talk
I was the responsibility that has been
I placed on trained scientists in recent
j years through the progress of in-
I dustry and development of new dis
j coveries such as the radio, sound
! pictures, color photography, and
i gases, such as helium.
Sciences Stimulated
"The great giants, chemistry and
j physics, roused up and shook them
j selves in the early 1900'5," Dr. Swain
| said. "Experts in the field have been
j supplied to them in great numbers
! up to 1932. Since then the opportu-
I nities for placing graduates dimin
i ished, but at the present time I feel
that we can hope to place most of
our graduates."
The two fields of teaching and in
! dustrial research are the most com
j mon ones entered by chemistry and
J physics graduates, Swain said, and
{ we find that in recent years those
' who have the master's and doctor's
[ degrees have the best chances of
j being placed.
Interest Needed
Describing the characteristics that
J a science major should possess Dr.
i Swain stated: "Men and women are
; wanted who have a profound inter
| est in their subject, who are capable
of getting along with other people,
and who are willing to work un
tiringly."
Dr. Swain cited several instances
, showing the breadth of the fields,
and the opportunities in research,
administration, and management of
industrial plants. He concluded by
advising students to choose their ca
| reers wisely and not hastily. "Se
j lecting a career is like selecting a
j wife or a husband. Its something
, you have to live with the rest of
your life."
