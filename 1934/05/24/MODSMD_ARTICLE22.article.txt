# Trackmen End Workouts for I.C.4-A. Today
## Seven Card Entries Arrive In Philadelphia For National Meet Trials Set for Tomorrow; Finals Saturday 
### Millard Browne 
With a reputation to protect and
a lot of eastern resentment to over
come, Stanford track athletes began
limbering up yesterday afternoon in
Philadelphia, prepared to make good
their favored position to bring home
first place in the Intercollegiate
A.A.A.A. meet tomorrow and Satur
day.
Seven Cardinal stars, accompanied
by Coach Dink Tempieton and Man
ager Sam Lowry, arrived in the
Pennsylvania city yesterday morn
ing in time to work cramped mus
cles back into shape yesterday and
today for tomorrow's preliminaries.
This is Stanford's last year in the
national meet, and representatives
from the East are as anxious tha't the
Cards leave the competition with a
bad taste as Tempieton and his men
are to make their final season one to
remember.
The seven Cardinals — John Ly
man, John Mottram, Bud Deacon,
Sam Klopstock, AL Blackman, Slin
ger Dunn, and Chuck Nimmo —all

Results of the 1.C.4-A. track
meet in Philadelphia will be
broadcast tomorrow and Satur
day, it was announced last
night.
The results will be relayed
over KFRC tomorrow from
12:30 to 1 o'clock, and Saturday
from 11 to 12 and from 12:30 to
I o'clock, and over KPO from
II to 1 o'clock Saturday.

have good chances of placing, al
though Nimmo is running into trou
ble when he enters the 800 meters
instead of the 1500.
Nimmo in Short Race
Because of a particularly out
standing group of eastern mile stars
this year, Ternpleton plans to run
the slim sophomore in the shorter
race. He has shown ability at this
event at times, but he has judged
his race poorly at other times.
Blackman is acknowledged a good
chance in the quarter-mile. His
chief opposition, Jimmy LuValle
and John McCarthy of U.C.L.A. and
U.S.C., are not entered in this year's
meet. LuValle won the 400-meters
dash last May.
May Place in 200
Blackman will be relieved of his
quarter-mile responsibilities before
the 200 meters begin, and he may
sneak in for a fourth or fifth in the
shorter sprint. "Bullet Bob" Kiesel
of California is an outstanding fa
vorite in this event as well as in
the century.
Although Lyman is rated virtually
a cinch in fhe shot, he and Dunn
have their work cut out in the dis
cus when they clash with a pair of
Harvard men, capable of 157 feet.
Dunn has equalled this mark this
year, but Lyman has yet to throw
the platter 150 feet.
Rumors of possible competition for
Mottram in the javelin have come
forth this week, and he may have to
toss the spear 220 feet to win.
Hurdles Questionable
Klopstock, with the tough assign
ment of winning both hurdles to
deliver, is one of the doubtful por
tions of the team. The sophomore
star has been consistent all year,
but Indian fans are dreading a fatal
fall. His only high barrier defeat of
the year, except from Captain Gus
Meier, was suffered at Troy when
he tripped over tv/o hurdics.

Blackman will be relieved of his
quarter-mile responsibilities before
the 200 meters begin, and he may
sneak in for a fourth or fifth in the
shorter sprint. "Bullet Bob" Kiesel
of California is an outstanding fa
vorite in this event as well as in
the century.
Although Lyman is rated virtually
a cinch in fhe shot, he and Dunn
have their work cut out in the dis
cus when they clash with a pair of
Harvard men, capable of 157 feet.
Dunn has equalled this mark this
year, but Lyman has yet to throw
the platter 150 feet.
Rumors of possible competition for
Mottram in the javelin have come
forth this week, and he may have to
toss the spear 220 feet to win.
Hurdles Questionable
Klopstock, with the tough assign
ment of winning both hurdles to
deliver, is one of the doubtful por
tions of the team. The sophomore
star has been consistent all year,
but Indian fans are dreading a fatal
fall. His only high barrier defeat of
the year, except from Captain Gus
Meier, was suffered at Troy when
he tripped over tv/o hurdics.
With a reputation to protect and
a lot of eastern resentment to over
come, Stanford track athletes began
limbering up yesterday afternoon in
Philadelphia, prepared to make good
their favored position to bring home
first place in the Intercollegiate
A.A.A.A. meet tomorrow and Satur
day.
Seven Cardinal stars, accompanied
by Coach Dink Tempieton and Man
ager Sam Lowry, arrived in the
Pennsylvania city yesterday morn
ing in time to work cramped mus
cles back into shape yesterday and
today for tomorrow's preliminaries.
This is Stanford's last year in the
national meet, and representatives
from the East are as anxious tha't the
Cards leave the competition with a
bad taste as Tempieton and his men
are to make their final season one to
remember.
The seven Cardinals — John Ly
man, John Mottram, Bud Deacon,
Sam Klopstock, AL Blackman, Slin
ger Dunn, and Chuck Nimmo —all

Results of the 1.C.4-A. track
meet in Philadelphia will be
broadcast tomorrow and Satur
day, it was announced last
night.
The results will be relayed
over KFRC tomorrow from
12:30 to 1 o'clock, and Saturday
from 11 to 12 and from 12:30 to
I o'clock, and over KPO from
II to 1 o'clock Saturday.

ble when he enters the 800 meters
instead of the 1500.
Nimmo in Short Race
Because of a particularly out
standing group of eastern mile stars
this year, Ternpleton plans to run
the slim sophomore in the shorter
race. He has shown ability at this
event at times, but he has judged
his race poorly at other times.
Blackman is acknowledged a good
chance in the quarter-mile. His
chief opposition, Jimmy LuValle
and John McCarthy of U.C.L.A. and
