the oldest living member of the orig
inal Stanford faculty, died Tuesday
in San Jose at the age of 88 years.
Funeral services were held this

Senator Stanford selected Peter
son in 1887 to take charge of the
forge and tool shop departments of
the University. His forge was set tip
in a wheat field while an old shed
served to shelter his tools.
His course was popular among the
students of his day, and this popu
larity was evidenced by the fact that
Herbert Hoover, as a student, took
three times the required number of
courses taught by Peterson. One of
Hoover's most precious possessions is
a hunting knife presented to him by
his former teacher.
Mrs. Stanford picked Peterson for
the work of moving the Stanford
art collection from the family home
in San Francisco to the Museum,
where his son, Harry Peterson, later
became curator.
When Senator Stanford died, Pe
terson sealed the body in its bronze
casket and marble sarcophagus. He
performed the same service for Mrs.
Stanford at the time of her death.
Peterson's wife, Emma C. Peterson,
died last March in Palo Alto, but he
is survived by his son, Harry, now
curator of the museum at Sutter's
Fort.
