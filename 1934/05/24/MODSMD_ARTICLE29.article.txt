# CELLAR TO GET $25,000, BOARD VOTES CHANGES
## Union Governors Approve Preliminary Plan For Enlargements WILL ADD SUN ROOM Interior To Be Done Over; Kitchen Extended 
### Charlotte Burridge 
Approval of expenditures up to
$25,000 for enlargement of the Cellar
was made by the Union Board of
Governors at the noon meeting yes
terday.
Addition of a large sun room at
the north end of the present build
ing will be constructed to make pos
sible quicker accommodation of the
crowds at rush periods. The kitchen
space will be extended to give more
room for dishwashing machines.
Preliminary plans passed by the
Board provide for a large beamed
ceiling room of more attractive inte
rior than Ihe old Cellar. Numerous
large windows will make the annex
much on the order of a sun room.
Actual Work Delayed
Although first plans were ap
proved by the Union Governors,
construction can not begin until de
tailed plans arc worked out. Clear
ing of the space to be used, and ex
cavation work prior to the digging
of foundation holes will delay actual
building for some time.
The increased number of women
on the campus, anticipation of a
larger enrollment fall quarter, and
inconvenience from cramped space
in the kitchen were given as the rea
sons for the action by Professor Wil
liam B. Owens, chairman of the
Union Board of Governors.
Pricc Indefinite
Twenty-five thousand dollars was
set by the committee as the maxi
mum amount to be expended, but
the new rooms are not expected to
exceed $20,000. The price of equip
ment is so uncertain that a definite
budget cannot be determined at
prsent.
Because' of its position, the new
room will be available for small spe
cial parties. It is possible ihat
screens may be used to separate the
annex from the main Cellar when
private parties are held.
In speaking of the addition, Owens
said, '"It will be a fine addition to the
present Cellar. We hope that it will
increase trade as well as to better
accommodate the present custo
mers."
