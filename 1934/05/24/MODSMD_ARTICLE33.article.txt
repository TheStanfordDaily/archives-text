A petition is being circulated l>v Block S men to defeat
Hie new by-law which allows Circle S men to qualify for
;i "major" award after having won three "minor" letters.
While these men have a perfect right to throw the issue
into the mess of a student body vote, Tin-: Daily doubts the
sagacity of their move. If they will look into the picture a
bit more thoroughly, they will see where they, as Block S
men, are only branding themselves with selfishness. Per
haps they are not selfish, but the impression is hound to
be left.
When Tin: Daily first started the movement (again, for
the 'steenth time) a few weeks ago to secure more, equal
recognition for Stanford athletes, it did so with the sug
gestion that all awards should be the same. Apparently,
the radical idea is too much for everybody to stomach, for
the final proposition made and accepted at Tuesday's Ex
ccutivc Committee session saw only a partial removal of
the barrier. Of course, there were a couple of slips such
% as allowing freshmen members of the horse polo team
Circle S sweaters instead of Circle Numerals, but those
were secondary.
And how that the difficulties have been partially ironed
out, along comes a disgruntled few with the proposal that
the argument be thrown out on the Quad for an election,
where only personalities of campaigners and prejudices of
athletes can be major factors.
Well, maybe it has become custom to throw up every
body's hands as soon as an "adverse" decision is made.
