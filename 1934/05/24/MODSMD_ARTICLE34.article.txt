# Strike Breakers Create Bad Reaction

(From thf I'.S.C. Daily Trojan)
The action of several S.C. students in helping break
the longshoremen's strike in San Pedro shows a lack of
understanding of the causes of strikes.
Tliev do not realize that when they take a striker's joh
Ihev are helping keep the standard of living down.
They do not see that they are keeping a working man
from the joh, perhaps permanently.
They do not see that the cause of the strike is to raise
wages and shorten hours, in other words, to make working
conditions better and to make it possible to raise a family
with some degree of comfort.
They do not see that the strike is the only means the
working men have of getting a fairer wage and shorter
hours. It has been sanctioned by the NRA and the right'
to picket peacefully has been upheld in the courts.
We do not think that the students had these things in
mind when they accepted the jobs as longshoremen.
Neither did the Stanford and California students who have
been working in San Francisco. Good intentions or not,
the results were the same; not only a hardship to the
strikers, but an unfavorable reaction against the university.
