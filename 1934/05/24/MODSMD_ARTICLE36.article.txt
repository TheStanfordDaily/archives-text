# WHY IT'S NEWS
## Thorns in the President's Side 
### CROMPTON BANGS Jr 
TOO MUCH POWER
IN THE WHITE HOUSE?
Within the next few months pres
ident Roosevelt will have to face a
barrage of Republican criticism.
This he expects. But the most both
ersome thing is the opposition ol
many powerful Democrats and in
surgent Republicans to his policies.
He had hoped they would help him.
Instead they have been his strong
est critics.
Slowly but steadily the idea is
spreading that there is too much
power in the White House. There
tire fears that the U.S. is drifting into
a bureaucratic dictatorship. There
are some who fear that the Consti
tution may be scrapped. This is
just the old Republican campaign
material, so it is not news—when
used by them.
SENATOR BORAH
FEARS THE FUTURE—IF
But recently Senator Borah — a
thorn in the side of more than one
President—has been orating agaipst
the New Deal. Because he is a col
orful character and a real orator, he
rates more newspaper space than all
the Republicans thrown togethr.
Borah does not challenge F.R.'s
faith or capability in carrying out
the New Deal. He is too wise to do
that. His argument is that placing
unconstitutional powers in capable
hands even for an emergency is sure
to establish a precedent for incapable
hands and dangerous actions in the

future. This is a powerful argument
and a reasonable one. F.R. wonders
how much damage Borah can do
during the campaign this summer.
AND NOW—
THE VICE-PRESIDENT
Garner might have become the
Forgotten Man of the New Deal—
except for one thing: his skill was
needed to get legislation through
Congress. He has helped more than
is generally known. Yet he is known
1o have serious doubts about the
New Deal. He has great faith in the
President—as long as he is Presi
dent. But Garner is afraid the New
Deal is building a Frankenstein that
might become really destructive
once F.R. is out of office. Many lead
ing Democrats are known to share
his views.
THE NEW
DEAL ANSWER
New Dealers answer these criti
| cisms by saying that the Constitution
1780 Model—is unsuited to cope
.with Depression — 1933-34 Model,
j This may bo so. Lawyers and eco
nomists are divided over the point.
However, the important thing is
ih;it the dangers of New Deal bu
] rraucracy and centralization are
j sure to be first-line campaign issues
this summer. With some Democrats
I and most insurgent G.O.P.'s on the
| firing line along with the regular
j Republicans, the New Deal can ex-
I pect «i slight setback in the fall. Re-
I member America is basically con-
I servative.
