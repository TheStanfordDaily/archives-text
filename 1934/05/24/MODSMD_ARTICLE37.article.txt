"BERTRAND OF BRITTANY:
A Biography of Du Guesclin." By
Roger Vercel. Yale University
Press, 19.14.
We have in the present volume a
study oi one of the principal charac
ters produced by the rising tide of
nationalism in France, during the
first Hundred Years' Anglo-French
War (1337-1453).
This struggle fulls into four dis
tinct phases: the first and third fa
vored England, the second and
fourth, France. Bertrand du Gues
clin of Brittany was the French mil
itary leader who made possible the
rise of French fortunes in the third
period, preparing the way for Joan
of Arc 50 years later.
Although he belonged to the petty
nobility, his physiognomy and make
up generally caused him to be
shunned, and Bertrand's youth was
a hard one. He resolved on a sol
dier's career, and patiently bore the
jibes and taunts of his companions.
Du Guesclin early formed the de
termination to devote his military
prowess to throwing off the English
yoke in his beloved France. He was
for many years a brigand chief, and
his Robin-Hood-like exploits were
the gossip of France.
Charles V of France enlisted Du
Guesclin in the royal service during
his entire reign and he succeeded in
driving the English out of France
and routed Pedro the Cruel from
Spain.
Du Guesclin emerges from the
covers of this book very much of a
personality. We have here all the
vicissitudes of medieval warfare and
chivalry faithfully portrayed. Du
Guesclin, despite his sanguinary pio
fession; was devoutly religious, and
had for his battle-cry, "Notre-Dame-
Guesclin."
To the general reader, the book
will be of considerable interest as a
live account of fourteenth-century
warfare. There is nothing prolix or
wearisome in its pages, and it gives
a true cross-section of French life
of the period, from the humble peas
ant abode to the royal court of
Charles V. —Larson
