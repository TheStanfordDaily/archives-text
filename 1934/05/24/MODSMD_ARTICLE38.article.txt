AIRLINES — Probably the most
enjoyable and best balanced pro
gram on the air at the present time
is. the Casa Loma Caravan, featuring j
Glen Gray's orchestra, Stoopnagle
and Budd, and Connie Boswell.
Glen Gray and his bandsmen, al- 1
(hough not the top musical aggre
gation of the country, are rightly ;
ranked among the four or five lead
ers. This ranking is to
the musical ability of Gene Gifford.
arranger extraordinary, and the vo- i
cal abilities of "Peewee" Hunt and i
Kenny Sargent.
Stoopnagle and Budd, those two
nonsensical comedians, purvey n
type of humor that has gained them
one of the largest and most faith
ful audiences in radio. Their com
edy is absolutely senseless, but it is
so silly it is funny, and the two hu- i
morists must be commended for the
fact that their jokes are nearly 100
per cent original.
Connie Boswell, feminine appeal
of the program, has one of the love
liest voices on the air, and in addi
tion is one of the best-liked head
liners as far as her studio associates I
are concerned.
Tlie sponsor has added immeas- '
ureably to the worth of the airing
by not allowing excessive advertis
ing or studio applause to mar their I
show, and for this deserve plenty of
praise from the listening fans.

AIRLINES — Probably the most
enjoyable and best balanced pro
gram on the air at the present time
is. the Casa Loma Caravan, featuring j
Glen Gray's orchestra, Stoopnagle
and Budd, and Connie Boswell.
Glen Gray and his bandsmen, al- 1
(hough not the top musical aggre
gation of the country, are rightly ;
ranked among the four or five lead
ers. This ranking is to
the musical ability of Gene Gifford.
arranger extraordinary, and the vo- i
cal abilities of "Peewee" Hunt and i
Kenny Sargent.
Stoopnagle and Budd, those two
nonsensical comedians, purvey n
type of humor that has gained them
one of the largest and most faith
ful audiences in radio. Their com
edy is absolutely senseless, but it is
so silly it is funny, and the two hu- i
morists must be commended for the
fact that their jokes are nearly 100
per cent original.
Connie Boswell, feminine appeal
of the program, has one of the love
liest voices on the air, and in addi
tion is one of the best-liked head
liners as far as her studio associates I
are concerned.
Tlie sponsor has added immeas- '
