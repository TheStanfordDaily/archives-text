# BULL SESSION
## OUR DANCING DOLLARS 
### 
A few dismal yellow and black
posters, still hanging forlornly on the
Quad, remind the campus that there
was a Junior Prom. Everyone says
the Junior Prom was a success—good
music, good food, good decorations.
The bookkeeper, perennial skeleton
in the closet of dance chairmen, tells
another story.
Despite the fact that almost 150
Stanford gentlemen plopped down
tidy little trios of greenbacks for the
sake of love and the Junior Prom,
the dance budget emerged with a
net deficit of approximately $80. The
size of the deficit itself is not signifi
cant. But people wonder why there
should be any sign of an unbalanced
budget when 300 people attend a
dance, and pay about $430 for the
privilege. %
When college students pay $3 per
bid for a campus dance, they expect
something for their money. The
Junior Prom committee bent over
backwards to give them that some
thing. The back-bend nicked the
decorations budget for $200. And the
same $3 bids, which necessitated a
$200 expenditure for decorations, ef
fectually kept down the sales, and
landed the dance in that sea of red
—where the Bookstore, Union, and
other campus curiosities already
wallow.

Most swank of all Stanford dances
—the Senior Ball—usually spends
about $100 for decorations. The
Masque Ball, lavish and financially
successful, cost far less for decora
tions and bids than did the Prom.
There has been built up a campus
tradition that "good" dances must
be expensive dances. The campus
demands "good" dances, and frowns
on expensive dances. That campus
frown —broad and deep—is the stu
dent weapon which will, and should,
drive expensive dances into the
depths of financial misery.
There is no doubt but that rea
sonably priced dances can be both
artistically and financially success
ful. With low-priced bids (and con
sequent high bid sale), unextrava
gant expenditures for decorations,
and generally efficient management,
campus dances will pay.
It is futile to contract lavish debts
in a wild effort to transfer a Stan
ford ball room into a "grand salon."
It is sufficiently lavish and pleasing
to transfer a Stanford gym into a
ball room. Everyone will be hap
pier. —Dave Mellinkoff

A few dismal yellow and black
posters, still hanging forlornly on the
Quad, remind the campus that there
was a Junior Prom. Everyone says
the Junior Prom was a success—good
music, good food, good decorations.
The bookkeeper, perennial skeleton
in the closet of dance chairmen, tells
another story.
Despite the fact that almost 150
Stanford gentlemen plopped down
tidy little trios of greenbacks for the
sake of love and the Junior Prom,
the dance budget emerged with a
net deficit of approximately $80. The
size of the deficit itself is not signifi
cant. But people wonder why there
should be any sign of an unbalanced
budget when 300 people attend a
dance, and pay about $430 for the
privilege. %
When college students pay $3 per
bid for a campus dance, they expect
something for their money. The
Junior Prom committee bent over
backwards to give them that some
thing. The back-bend nicked the
decorations budget for $200. And the
same $3 bids, which necessitated a
$200 expenditure for decorations, ef
fectually kept down the sales, and
landed the dance in that sea of red
—where the Bookstore, Union, and
other campus curiosities already
wallow.

Most swank of all Stanford dances
—the Senior Ball—usually spends
about $100 for decorations. The
Masque Ball, lavish and financially
successful, cost far less for decora
tions and bids than did the Prom.
There has been built up a campus
tradition that "good" dances must
be expensive dances. The campus
demands "good" dances, and frowns
on expensive dances. That campus
frown —broad and deep—is the stu
dent weapon which will, and should,
drive expensive dances into the
depths of financial misery.
