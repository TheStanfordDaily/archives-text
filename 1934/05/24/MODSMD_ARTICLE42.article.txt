# CAMPUS OPINION
## DEFENDS DEBATERS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The Stanford debaters have been
criticized for finding fault with
American institutions; and so the
letter writer to yesterday's Campus
Opinion, being a good American,
finds fault with the debaters. Now
if it is wrong to criticize things
American, the first to be condemned
should be certain professors of his
toiy, sociology, political science, and
even education, who, in an effort to
stimulate thought and use of our
muchly touted "scientific attitude,"
have the courage to point out faults
when they do exist.
In the second place a Stanford de
bater is above high-school age, and
he is sensible enough to realize that
the truth must lie somewhere be
tween the opposing issues of a de
bate. A debatable proposition has
elements of truth o,n either side; and
this evening in the Little Theatre,
the Stanford debaters will attempt
to show how America can profit by
consideration of the English system
of education. Is it not true that ho
who can find a way to make his
country better is just as loyal as he
who refuses to find fault?
Very truly,
