# ALUMNI CONTRIBUTE TO JUNE 'ESQUIRE'
## Discuss Legalized Dueling, Professional Diving 
### 
Two former Stanford students,
Fred Glover and Sanderson Smith,
are authors of articles in the June
number of "Esquire."
Glover, '33, all-University boxing
champion last year, is now traveling
in Europe. In Germany he witnessed
student duels, now legalized under
the Hitler regime, which are the
subject of his writing. Glover is a
member of Delta Tau Delta frater
nity.
'"What Is This Fancy Diving?" is
the title of Smith's article. Smith,
ex-'3l, was a sensational varsity di
ver in his sophomore year, but left
after the autumn quarter in his jun
ior year* to turn professional, and has
been teaching, diving, and writing
about diving since then. He is the
son of the late Everett W. Smith,
former head of the Stanford Division
of Journalism.
Illustrations for "What Is This
Fancy Diving?" were done by Dick
Lucy, '31, who was a Graphic Arts
major and is now a commercial
artist.
