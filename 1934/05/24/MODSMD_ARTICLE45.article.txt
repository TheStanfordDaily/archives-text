# SIDELINE SLANTS..
## SPRING GRID CLIMAX TODAY 
### 
That football game this afternoon
will be a Rood show for fans, but it
will be particularly valuable to Tiny
Thornhill and assistants. Seven
weeks of practice, half-hearted in
many cases, will be climaxed with
one of the few scrimmages of the
session, and the Cardinal grid direc
tor will have some definite ideas as
to how his team will line up next
fall following the contest.
A certain quarterback on which
several pairs of eyes will be focused
will appear on the varsity field to
day. Stan Anderson, 1932 Big Game
punting hero, after a year's side
lining because of injuries, is on a
comeback try against a much-pub
licized group of sophomore backfield
stars. Either Anderson or Frank
Alustiza will start in the driver's
seat of the so-called first team.
