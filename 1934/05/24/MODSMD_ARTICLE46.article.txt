# FROSH LINEMEN TO SEE ACTION
## 
### 
Several freshmen will claim other
attention. A few gaping holes, es
pecially in the line, must be plugged,
and it will bo interesting to .see how
some of those who have been proudly
parading '''37" sweaters about the
Farm will stack up in varsity com
petition.
This group of potentials includes,
among others, Jack Walton, Louis
Tsoutsouvas, Tony Aguilar, Call
Schott, and Walt Chouteau. Because
of a slight injury this week to Keith
Topping yearling ends particularly
will see action.
