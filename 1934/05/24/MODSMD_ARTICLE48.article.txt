# PREP TRACK STARS GOOD
## 
### 
A clue as to where Troy habitually
gets outstanding track material may
be found on a trip to Berkeley Sat
urday, where high school stars from
all over the slate will gather lor the
annual C.I.F. meet. Southern Cali
fornia schools are invariably pre
dominant in the contest, and their

marks each season in many events
surpass those set by disdainful col
legiate stars.
Among the more outstanding state
records are 9.6 in the 100, 21.2 in tRe
220, 23.5''4 in the broad jump, 6:3%
in the high jump, 14.8 in the low
hurdles, and 23.9 in the highs. Many
of these standards are expected to
be broken Saturday. Stanford could
use some of those athletes in Phila
delphia this week-end.
U.C.L.A., the West's youngest ma
jor educational institution, is boast
ing in Duke Trotter its first winner
of three major sports letters. Trotter,
a sophomore, is the son of the
school's oldest coach, Harry Trotter.
He played guard on the footbail
eleven, guard on the basketball team
and won each of his four starts as a
Bruin pitcher. The senior Trotter
was a three-letter man at U.S.C. in
his undergraduate days.â€”Browne
