# PHI DELTS BEAT A.T.O.'S TO TAKE BASEBALL TITLE
## 
### 
Just as if there had been no doubt, [
the Phi Delts whipped the A.T.O.'s, !
7 to 0, to win the intramural Softball j
championship on the frosh gridiron i
yesterday afternoon. Don Greenlee. 1
star Phi Deit pitcher, set down the
A.T.O.'s, with five scattered hits, |
never yielding more than one an in
ning.
The winners settled the game in '
the first inning, scoring four runs on
Pete Donlon's walk, Harry Booth's
single, and home runs by Bill Quade
and Jack Norwood, Quade's driving
three runs across the plate. Ernie
Arbuckle's slants then baffled the
losers until the seventh and final
frame, when they counted three;
more times on singles by Jim Dillon 1
and Quade and a circuit clout by
Don Greenlee..
In the meantime, however, Green
lee was alternating wide curves and

fast balls to keep the A.T.O.'s from
even threatening to score. The
losers' only extra-base hit was Ste- j
wart's double in the sixth, while the
four singles were made by Goss in
the first and third, Arbuckle in the
fourth, and Murphy in the seventh.
Greenlee struck out six of A.T.O.'s, I
getting Manger, Favour, and Murphy j
each twice. He had perfect control,
not walking a single man. Arbuckle
issued only one free ticket, but that
one—to Donlon in the first—cost him
two runs. The A.T.O. hurler fanned
five Phi Delts—Stark, McGuire,
Donlon, Dillon, and Norwood.
Quade was the game's leading hit
ter, with a homer, triple, and single
to his credit. Greenlee and Nor
wood, with home runs, and Booth
and Dillon, each with a pair of
singles, were runners-up for the
batting honors, together with Goss
of the A.T.O.'s.
The line-ups were as follows:
Phi Delts—P. Donlon, c; H. Booth,
rf; W. Quade, lb: D. Greenlee, p; K.
