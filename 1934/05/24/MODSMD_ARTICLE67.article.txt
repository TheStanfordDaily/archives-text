More than 60 cargo vessels were laid up in San Francisco bay due to the longshoremen's strike which
has affected all ports between Canada and Mexico on the Pacific coast. A section of the San Francisco
waterfront is shown with ships at piers and anchored in the stream to save wharfagi charges. (Associ
