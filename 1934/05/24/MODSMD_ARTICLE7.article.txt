Striking swifty and quietly, the Bulgarian army abolished constitutional government and took control of the
nation under a military dictatorship established by royal decrees. King Boris (right), 40-year-old monarch of
Bulgaria, acquiesed promptly in the new state of affairs and signed the decrees that dissolved parliament and
put the new government with Kimon Queroguieff as premier, in power. At left is the royal palace of Sofia where
