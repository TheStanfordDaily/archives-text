FOR breakfast, Kellogg's
Corn Flakes set you up for
the day. Those crisp de
licious flakes, with milk or
cream, or fruit added, sup
ply the energy you need
and are easy to digest.
For a quick, satisfying
lunch, eat a bowlful of
Kellogg's Corn Flakes. So
much better than hot,heavy
dishes that often slow you
up in afternoon classes.
Then if you're hungry
at bedtime, Kellogg's Corn
Flakes are just the thing.
Ask your Hub or fraternity
steward to keep them on
hand or get them >DRA
at your campus
restaurant. SCRtr
