# Honor Code Is Examined
## Women's Council Suggests Desk-Tapping Policy 
### 
Can the revival of an old Stanford
1 custom save the Stanford Honor
Code? That is the question in the
minds of members of Women's
I Council who are trying to revive the
practice of desk-tapping to cut down
i the number of violations that have
; been threatening the existence of
; the Stanford system.
Desk-tapping has nothing to do
I with spiritualism. It is a very ef
l fective way of stopping violations,
according to Council members who
are concentrating on maintaining
rules of fair play during the com-
I ing. examination period. As it was
practiced at Stanford for many years
' it consisted of tapping on the desk
whenever violations of the code were
seen.
Easier Method
Though a much more direct way
1 of stopping cheating is to go up to
j the violator and ask him to tear up
his paper, it requires a good deal of
"that certain thing" to do this, and
desk-tapping is an easier way, ac
cording to the women proposing it.
j They ask that during the coming
ex's that students rap on the desk
I with a pencil or pen if they see
I cheating. If the whole class will take
j this up it should provide a sufficient
incentive to the offending student to
: stop. If he fails to do this, the stu
dent is asked to report the violator
! to the Men's or Women's Council as
j in the past.
Co-operation Needed
In starting the campaign for the
: honor of the Honor Code, Council
' members remind students that the
| Code requires two things: that the
student observe it himself, and that
j he keeps others up to the standard.
I If students will co-operate in re
i viving the old custom, which was
once very successful, they look for
j ward to the possibility that the
i Honor Code, which was also very
j successful once, wiil regain its for-
I rner prestige.
