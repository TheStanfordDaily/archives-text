# Block "S" Proposal Certain To Go Before Student Body
## 
### 
That athletic by-laws giving a
Block "S" to third-year winners of
a Circle "S" will have to face the
approval of a campus vote before
they can be officially added to the
new Constitution became almost a
certainty yesterday. A petition with
150 signatures asking for a Quad
vote was finally filled out and is
ready for presentation to the Ex
Committee Tuesday night.
Circulated by Frank Fullcnwider,
member of the Constitutional Revi
sion Committee, the petition is the
first use of the system inaugurated
[ by the new Constitution, which pro
; vides for a Quad vote on any by
laws or amendments passed by 1 lie
I Ex Committee if a petition of 150
j signatures is presented at the first
; meeting after their enactment by
the Ex Committee.
Fullenwider, who wrote the Cir
i cle "S" provision in the new by
i laws, circulated the petition for the
1 purpose of getting student opinion
on the measure. According to his
statement submitted to the Daily:
"My object in circulating the peti
tion was merely to ascertain the
opinion of the student body on a
matter which affects and will afiect
the interests of the campus as a
whole. I have always believed that
a general vote is the only way in
which to obtain this expression of

opinion.
Phil Williams, varsity trackman,
I says: "I am opposed to the granting
of a Block 'S' to third-year minor
I sports men on the ground Ihat there
.should be a definite distinction be
| tween major and minor sports. It
â–  has been considered more difficult
to make a letter in one sport than in
another, and in the first case there
| is often more competition. On this
basis, and in order to give some
award to those less competitive
sports, major and minor sport
( awards originated. I believe this
traditional attitude is correct.
"At present I also believe that any
changing of the rules for ihe grant
ing of athletic awards should be
placed before the entire student
body for its approval. For this rca
j son I have been circulating the peti
tion mentioned in Thursday morn
j ing's Daily."
The election, which will bo prob
j ably be held next week, will witness
j a struggle between the two sport
groups. The results will hinge on
the fight between the present Block
"S" men, who may or may not care
whether more blocks are given out,
and the militant, organized Circle
"S" men, 200 in number, who very
definitely care and who helped to
defeat the first proposed Constitu
tion for this reason.
