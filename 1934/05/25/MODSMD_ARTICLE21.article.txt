# Card Debaters Beaten by B.C. Squad, 3 to 2
## American System Proved Superior to English By Northerners Woodbury, Grantier Take Affirmative Side 
### 
Before a crowd which filled every
j .seat and even the aisles of the Little
j Theatre, the visiting debate team
j from the University of British Co
j lumbia won a 3 to 2 decision over
j their Stanford opponents last night,
j The affirmative of the question,
i "Resolved, that the English system
i of education is better than the Amer
j ican system as a preparation for
i life," was upheld by Bob Grantier
i and Rollin Woodbury representing
J Stanford. Jack Conway and Ernest
; Erown of British Columbia took the
• opposition.
Grantier Opens
The first affirmative speaker, Bob
Grantier, based his argument on the
| contention that no matter what the
j college man intends to do after grad
j uation, he wants of his education the
I preparation for a job and some cul
tural return for the money he has
spent.
The American student receives his
education by the clock, the speaker
maintained, and thus has no time for
the random contemplation which
makes for true culture. Grantier
deplored also the mechanization of
] organization and the depersonaliza
| tion which are the result of mass
J education in America.
Conway Opposes
With dry and witty humor, Jack
j Conway of the opposing team made
I the first negative speech. English
education is divided into two classes,
he said, the upper and the lower,
and this distinction gives the poor
little chance of a good education,
whether they have ability or not.
Because of low tuition and demo
cratic spirit in America, education
is made possible to all; the poor
have here as good a chance of rising
| to the top as have the rich.
Rollin Woodbury, second Stanford
! speaker, affirmed that in England
| those who could not otherwise afford
! an education are given scholarships
i according to ability, and that thus
I all who are able can receive the ed
j ucation which will fit them for high
| positions.
Americans Educated
That because the American public
i have received more education than
any nation in the world, they have
i progressed toward co-operation with
| the government and have an under
! standing of world affairs, was the
contention of Ernest Brown, British
j Columbia student who gave the con
i eluding address. He brought out the
i snobbishness of the upper classes at
| Cambridge and Oxford as a serious
j detriment to the poor, who are dis-
I criminated against there.
Closing by exploding the theory
I that because the English system of
j education is old it is good, Brown
j asserted that the American system,
J founded on trial and error, is made
j to fit the mold of 20th century in
dustrial technique and is thus better
I prepared to equip the college grad
! uate for life.
Dean Grayson Kefauver of the
i School of Education made the con
j eluding remarks.
The committee of judges was com-
I posed of Professor Peter Odegard,
; visiting professor of political science
I from Ohio State University; the
Hon. P. Dolpon Murray, vice-consul
of Great Britain at San Francisco;
G. B. Walster, Palo Alto merchant;
Dr. Charles Gardner, chaplain of
Stanford; and A. C. Barker, super
i intendent of the Palo Alto schools.

Before a crowd which filled every

j ican system as a preparation for
i life," was upheld by Bob Grantier
i and Rollin Woodbury representing
J Stanford. Jack Conway and Ernest
; Erown of British Columbia took the
• opposition.
Grantier Opens
The first affirmative speaker, Bob
Grantier, based his argument on the
| contention that no matter what the
j college man intends to do after grad
j uation, he wants of his education the
I preparation for a job and some cul
tural return for the money he has
spent.
The American student receives his
education by the clock, the speaker
maintained, and thus has no time for
the random contemplation which
makes for true culture. Grantier
deplored also the mechanization of
] organization and the depersonaliza
| tion which are the result of mass
J education in America.
Conway Opposes
With dry and witty humor, Jack
j Conway of the opposing team made
I the first negative speech. English
education is divided into two classes,
he said, the upper and the lower,
and this distinction gives the poor
little chance of a good education,
whether they have ability or not.
Because of low tuition and demo
cratic spirit in America, education
is made possible to all; the poor
have here as good a chance of rising
| to the top as have the rich.
Rollin Woodbury, second Stanford
! speaker, affirmed that in England
| those who could not otherwise afford
! an education are given scholarships
i according to ability, and that thus
I all who are able can receive the ed
j ucation which will fit them for high
| positions.
Americans Educated
That because the American public
i have received more education than
any nation in the world, they have
i progressed toward co-operation with
| the government and have an under
! standing of world affairs, was the
contention of Ernest Brown, British
j Columbia student who gave the con
i eluding address. He brought out the
i snobbishness of the upper classes at
| Cambridge and Oxford as a serious
j detriment to the poor, who are dis-
I criminated against there.
