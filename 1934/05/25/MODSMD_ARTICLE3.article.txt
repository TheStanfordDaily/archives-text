# Four Chapters Plan Increased Housing Space
## Sororities Begin Expansion To Accommodate Large Pledge Classes Kappa, Alpha Phi, Theta, Delta Gamma Enlarge 
### 
With at least four chapters defi
nitely planning enlargements during
the summer months, two others con
sidering minor remodeling, and a
seventh having "nothing to say at
present," the sorority housing situa
tion appears to be at least partially
solved.
All nine houses anticipate an in
crease in residents fall quarter, and
approximately half require altera
tions to accommodate the additional
members.
To Add Bedrooms
Alpha Phi intends to add addi
tional bedrooms as well as enlarging
living and dining-room space. Work
is slated to begin immediately after
the close of school.
Kappa Kappa Gamma is likewise
planning enlargements on a mod
erate scale, increased bedroom space
heading the list.
The Delta Gamma house, already
providing for 30, needs little expan
sion. Minor repairs, and perhaps
several unimportant additions, arc
definitely provided for, however.
May Make Changes
Already able to house the quota
of 30, Delta Delta Delta considers
"provisional" changes in dining
room, with perhaps other alterations.
A two-year-ago redecoration of
Gamma Phi Beta has made further
innovation unnecessary, but addi
tional space may be required in the
future.
Chi Omega and Pi Beta Phi, both
with ample room for 30 women, will
make no changes, while Alpha 0 re
fuses to divulge plans, if any.
Have 24 Pledges
Leading with a pledge class of 24,
Alpha Phi expects the largest gain
fall quarter. Delta Gamma and
Kappa, with 20 each, already had
approximately 30 x'esidents, while
Theta with 18 remains almost the
same.
Graduates, in the majority of
cases, will not live at the houses next
year.
