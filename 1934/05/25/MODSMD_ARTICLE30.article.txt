# I.C.4-A. VICTORY PREDICTED FOR CARD TRACKMEN
## KFRC, KPO To Broadcast Outcome of Trials Today, Tomorrow SCORE FIGURED AT 38 Cornell and Yale Expected To Be Runners-up 
### Millard Browne 
Stanford, 38; Cornell and Yale,
each 25; California, 23.
That is a compiled opinion of
authorities on the way the 1.C.4-A.
track and field meet in Philadelphia
today and tomorrow should finish.
And Coach Dink Templeton and his
seven sons of the Red will begin
qualifying heats and trials this af
ternoon with just such a finish in
mind.
Results of today's trials will be
broadcast over KFRC from 12:30
to 1 o'clock, and tomorrow's results
will go on the air over the same
station from 11 to 12 o'clock and
from 12:30 to 1 o'clock. KPO will be
devoted to 1.C.4-A. reports from 11
to 1 o'clock.
Stanford's rating at first glance
seems to be a bit over-compliment
ary to the Cardinal stars, Sam Klop
stock, Johnny Lyman, Slinger Dunn,
A1 Blackman, Chuck Nimmo, Bud
Deacon, and John Mottram.
Cards May Do Better
But v/ith the Indians coming
through individually with excep
tional performance, the Card total
could even be extended to 43 or 44
points.
The combined rating figures
Blackman a first place in the 400
meters, Klopstock a first in the low
and second in the high hurdles> Ly
man a first in the shot and fourth in
the discus. Dunn third in the discus
and second in the shot, Mottram first
in the javelin, Deacon second in the
pole vault, and Nimmo fifth in the
1500 meters.
Other possible points would be
forthcoming Xrom Blackman in the
200. Klopstock for a first instead of
second in the high barriers, Lyman
and Dunn with better places in the
discus, and a sensational winning
vault by Deacon.
Chances for Slips
However, the 38 points are more
apt to be diminished than boosted.
In the first place, Nimmo probably
will not run the mile; he will com
pete in the 800 meters with only a
slight chance of placing. Also, Dea
con may fall before a horde of Yale
pole vaulters. And anything may
happen to Klopstock in the hurdles.
Yale and Cornell plan to swarm
on Stanford's tiny group in several
events, and ihe Indians' sister
school from Berkeley may turn
traitor to the Western cause if Ly
man and Dunn are not up to top
form.
Hurdles on Spot
For example, if Klopstock slows
his hurdle pace, Cornell will have
a good chance of one-two in the
highs, and Yale and Cornell may
break into the heavy scoring in the
lows.
Keith Brown, Pierce, and Thomp
son, all 14-foot pole vaulters, may
crash in for points galore in the
pole vault. Brown is rated by most
of the authorities as a better bet for
first place than is Deacon.
Besides Yale and Cornell, Eastern
schools that figure to place well in
Ihe meet are Manhattan, New York
University, Harvard, and Princeton.
May Push Mottram
Heading the Manhattan entries is
Odeil defending javelin champion.
He probably will furnish Mottram
with his ciiicf trouble. Harvard,
with a well-balanced team possess
ing but a few really outstanding in
dividuals, defeated Yale by a heavy
score in their annual dual meet last
week.
I With George Spitz a near-cinch in
| the high jump, N.Y.U. gives prom
ise of gathering a fairly high score,
i Princeton's Bill Bonthron is ex
pected to contribute ten points in
the 800 and 1500 meters.
Other potential double winners
i are Bob Kiesel of California in the
sprints and Kiopstock, who is rated
the outstanding entry in both hur
' dies.
Stanford arrived in Philadelphia
Wednesday morning in company
I with five California athletes. They
devoted Wednesday afternoon to a
1 fairly hard workout and tapered off
I yesterday.
Qualifying today will involve six
of the seven Card entries. Deacon

! will not be required to compete in
the pole vault until tomorrow, when
the entire event will be run off.
Barring upsets, none of the six
| should have difficulty in passing the
first test.
To Enter Furlong
! Blackman will run one 400-meter
[ heat, and then compete in the 200
| trials. He probably will place in the
latter, but may run into difficulties
1 when he reaches the semi-finals.
Aj 1 but six men will be elimi
nated today in the weights, and
| marks made in the qualifying
j rounds will stand up for the finals
unless they are bettered tomorrow.
Because of the meter system, first
inaugurated at last year's meet,
| quite a number of this year's win
j ners on the track will install new
meet records. The 1.C.4-A. field
standards, however, are still meas
| ured in feet and inches.
