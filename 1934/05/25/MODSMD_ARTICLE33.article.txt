# The 						Indians' Last Stand

### 
Three thousand miles away from the campus where
they have trained for the event, a little band of seven Stan
ford trackmen today starts participation in the last 1.C.. I-A.
meet which will have entries from the Farm. On their
shoulders rest the hopes and predictions for another na
tional championship. Perhaps inexperience will result in
the younger athletes falling by the wayside. Perhaps their
showings will be the deciding factor in bringing more
honors to Stanford.
At any rale, Stanford looks with sorrow on the meet,
knowing that henceforth the (Cardinal will wave no longer
at this important att'air. In its place has been substituted,
by faculty ruling, another good meet, the National C.ol
legiatcs, but unfortunately the X.C..A.A. generally is staged
during the week of limit examinations here, and Stanford
will be unable to send its delegations. In other words, the
faculty has prevented Eastern track and tield competition
for one of the greatest schools in that sport that the ath
letic world has kDown.
t'ndoubtedly, that fact will be uppermost in the minds
of those seven men today and tomorrow. They realize that
this is their last shot at I lie Big Time. Hereafter they will
meet the best in their own geographical area where most
of the track and field champions are produced where the
East dislikes to admit are the best athletes and teams and
where national recognition (in the mind of the majority
of the nation's population) therefore is not placed as reg
ularly as it should be.
The Farm looks to Philadelphia, hoping that the end of
Stanford's traditional competition against the Fast's best
will once again see the West triumphant.
