WAVE OF STRIKES
Today the country is facing one
of the worst strike waves in its
history. The actual number of
strikes is not so very great, but all
of them are very serious. Yesterday
in Toledo Ohio National Guards
men had to repel three thousand
strikers with tear gas and gunfire;
three were killed and a score in
jured. In Minneapolis a recurrence
of yesterday's serious riot of truck
drivers is expected.
'Pacific Coast longshoremen have
been joined by Gulf Coast dock
workers — tying up all shipping
there. On both coasts things have
gotten to the point where there will
be considerable bloodshed unless
the strikes are settled. The head of
the International Longshoremen's
Association landed in San Francisco
yesterday to help effect a settlement
—we hope.
SETTLEMENT
MEANS SACRIFICE
At this stage of the game no set
tlement can grant all the longshore
men want or all the shippers want.
Any such settlement would only
make things worse. So any solu
tion of the present trouble will ne
cessitate some sacrifice by both
sides. Now which can sacrifice the
most?
It is perfectly obvious that the
shipping companies can afford to
meet the longshoremen's demands
halfway — if this will settle the
strike. It, is alst> perfectly obvious

that the longshoremen could use
the additional money; they need it
more than the steamship companies
do. How the money would be spent
is immaterial. If a wage increase
and a fairer distribution of the
available work will settle the strike,
they should start at once.
As things are now with both sides
growling at each other and unwill
ing to talk business, the outcome
can only be a violent one.
As long as the employers persist
in waving the putrified red herring
in the strikers' face, and as long as
the longshoremen advocate violence,
things will stay where they are—
only they will get worse. Whenever
both sides are willing to sit down
with people who know the strike
business and settle the strike in the
only sensible way, real progress will
be made.
NO SETTLEMENT
MACHINERY NOW GOING
These strikes have brought out
very clearly the need for special
U.S. boards- with real powers—to
settle strikes. As things are now the
National Labor Board, the NRA and
the Department of Labor are all
trying to settle the strike. F.R. is
known to be planning a central
board with enough authority to keep
industrial peace.
Such a hoard would do two im
portant things: (I) It would settle
the present strikes fairly; (2) it
would keep business healthy just
when it is showing signs of taking
a nose dive. Both these things are
badly needed.
