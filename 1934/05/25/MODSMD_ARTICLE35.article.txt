# BULL SESSION
## IN RESPONSE TO NUMEROUS REQUESTS 
### 
j Dear Mother.
Things have been awful dead here.
There has not been a murder or a
smashup all week, and the campus
i.s pretty griped. California robbed
I us of the weekly headline in the
I Call-Bulletin; they pulled a nifty
1 little job—an athlete got .slugged by
! a hitchhiker. One of the fellows did
j get thrown out of a wrestling ring
down in Menlo, but with San Fran
| cisco rolling up attacks, and Berk
j cloy crashing through with that
I murder, feeling is very low on the
Farm.
You might think it's kinda bad
to start my letter with the crime
j news, but to those of us who love
' the Farm, it's a matter of personal
j pride. Anyhow, I have been feeling
I fine. The ants still have the upper
, hand in Branner. Lately, we have
' been getting a little variety with
! moths, mosquitoes, and a few spi- I
i ders. They say it's much worse in I
! Roble.
j The Union (you know, the place
I where they give you "Robbery with
I a Smile") pulled a funny one the
other day. They have been losing
money all along, so they finally de
| cidecl to do something about it. They
j have capitalized their deficit, and
j decided to make an addition to the
j building in order to have more room
to accommodate their net losses
Someone suggested that the Union
be put on a paying basis, but the
administration is afraid the shock
' would be too great for the old- l
I timers. Besides, there's been a bi,i;
j move to keep Stanford tradition
I That girl I told you about is still
chasing around with that dumb
ciuck I told you about. But she i.s
green, and thinks he is true-blue,
so maybe love is color-blind after |
jail
The local SERA got ahold of some
more easy money, and they arc
having one heck of a time trying to
get rid of it. They have been doing
everything to wheedle the fellows
into taking the money except knock 'i
them over the heads and force them
to take it. But some of the boys
have already signed up with the
1936 Republican and Socialist Speak
ing Bureaus, and they figure it j
would look bad to bite the hand | £
that feeds. There is some honor
among college men.
That's about all there is. We've £
had a haystack fire about every
night, and the administration is
pretty sore, but the firemen like it; r
it's the first fun they've had since
last spring quarter. Hope you are r j
all feeling fine; thanks for the cook
ies; my laundry will be home on £
time; the car is still running. Love,
—Dave, I
j Dear Mother.
