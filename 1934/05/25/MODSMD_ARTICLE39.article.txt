# THE 						REVIEWER
## STAND UP AND CHEER (Fox) 
### 
At the Stanford Theatre
Starting out with a terrific bang,
this musical held promise of being
worthy of the superlatives of its
trailer. It seems that the president
of these United States created a
Secretary oi' Amusement in the hope
that, by raising the people's morale,
l'ear would disappear, confidence re
turn, and (he depression come to an
end. Bearing a striking resemblance
"Of Thee I Sing," it, however, adds
nothing new to the successful Kauf
man opus except a lew songs.
Music, situations, and dialogue
were all swell at first, but suddenly
went soupy when the necessity of
plot-development faced the director.
Ail the enthusiasm of the earlier
part of the picture disappeared in a
while of saccharine sentimentality.
The director realized this and imme
diately (almost abruptly) decided to
end the depression. So, defeat turned
lo victory as Paul Revere galloped
across the sky to the tune of "We're
Out of the Red."' The understanding
populace rushed to Ihe streets, or
ganized parades and marched cam
eraward, singing, of course, the
paean "We're Out of the Red."
Really outstanding bits:
1. Little Shirley Temple doing the
"Baby Take a Bow'' number.
2. The Penguin imitating Schnoz
zle Durante.
3. Stepin Fetchit dancing the
Shim-sham.
