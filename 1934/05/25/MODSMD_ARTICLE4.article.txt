# Large Profits Made at Fete
## 
### 
A record profit on the Mothers'
Club May Fete, which was given
Wednesday in the Paul Shoup Gar
dens in Los Altos, is expected, as
the gross receipts amounted to ap
proximately $1,000, it was revealed
today by Mrs. Almon Roth and Mrs.
Thomas Storey, co-chairmen of the
affair.
Net receipts for the lea last year
were $732, while in 1932 $480 was
cleared. Although the expenses have
not yet been deducted, it is ex
pected that this year's profit will be
far in excess of that in any previous
year.
With over 1.000 people in attend
ance, money taken in for tickets
amounted to $550. The booths were
sold out completely, and a large
number of further orders for special
foodstuffs were taken. The remaind
er of the money was received in the
form of donations amounting to
about $60.
