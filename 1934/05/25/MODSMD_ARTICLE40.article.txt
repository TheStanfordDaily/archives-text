At the Varsity Theatre
One of the movie producers oc
casionally attempts to produce a
picture which points a moral. This
picture is of that type, but due to
mixed-up action and a .series of
seemingly disjointed sequences, it
fails miserably in its original pur
pose and only succeeds in bewil
dering an apathetic audience.
With the single exception of Frank
Morgan, who is good, the cast is
decidedly uninteresting. Douglas
Fairbanks, Jr., as the male lead, as
sumes a perplexed air that is very
much out of place in the role he is
assigned.
Genevieve Tobin, usually some
what vacant in expression, is even
more so in her present role. Colleen
Moore is perpetually tragic as the
girl who loses "her man" to a de
signing woman, only to have him
return to her arms, repentant, for
the final fadeout.
Edward Everett Horton does well
with a very minor part, and his
deft humor does much to bolster up
a very mediocre picture.

In contrast to the first half of the
bill, the Varsity offers what is prob
ably the most amusing opus Will
Rogers has made to date. Although

based on an insignificant story, in
tlio usual manner of Rogers pictures,
the film incorporates so many hu
morous incidents that story defi
! ciencies go unnoticed
The cast is uniformly good and all
; are natural in their roles, but the
best performances must be credited
jto Will Rogers, as a small-town
j banker and horse trader, and Stepin
; Fetchit, the very amusing "nigger
boy" with the high, squeaky voice
