The Daily wishes to announce the
receipt of two Campus Opinions, one
from Frank Fullenwider and one
from Spencer Thompson. Mr.
Thompson's has been either mislaid
or lost. Mr. Fullenwider's is well
beyond the 200-word limit to which
Campus Opinions are restricted.
If Mr. Fullenwider wishes to pre
sent his facts within the customary
spa<?e, he Ls welcome. We apologize
to Mr. Thompson for the loss of his
letter and suggest that it be written
againâ€”this time to be set in type,
v/e promise.
A faculty supper will be held this
Sunday at Roble.
