# Student Release Cards For SERA Due Monday
## 
### 
Every student who has previously
worked under the SERA program,
who wishes to work in June, and
can put in 15 hours of skilled or 18
hours of unskilled labor next month,
should report to the Student Em
ployment Office Monday to obtain
release cards.
Departments must have all their
requests for projects in by Monday,
May 28, if they expect to have any
work done in June, as students will
be assigned at that time. Immediate
action is imperative because of the
little time left in this quarter.
