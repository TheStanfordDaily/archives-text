# SENIOR CARDS HELD AS SKATE SECURITY
## Ice Cream Provided For Monday Quad Party 
### 
Seniors who attend the skating
party on the Quad next Monday eve
ning must present senior dues cards
before they may rent roller skates,
Bill Morse, social committee chair
man, emphasized last night.
The skates will be rented for 25
cents a pair, and the cards will be
held as a deposit until the skates are
returned, Morse explained.
The party will be held from 7:30
to 10 o'clock Mofiday under a full

the way of senior social functions,
and much enthusiasm has been evi
denced.
Morse's committee, consisting of
Dorothy Brown, Dorothy Wehe,
Prentice Messimer, and Ondy Mar
tin, has completed plans for the af
fair, which will be terminated by
the serving of free ice cream to class
members who have their dues cards.
