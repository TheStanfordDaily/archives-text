# DR. ABRAMS TO BE GUEST SPEAKER AT FLOWER FESTIVAL
## Botanist To Discuss Flora Of Sierra Nevadas 
### 
Professor Leßoy Abrams of the
Botany Department left early this
morning by automobile for Yose
mite Valley, where he will speak
Saturday on the botany of the Sierra
Nevadas. This address will be a fea
ture of the Yosemite Wild Flower
Festival, which is now in progress
and will continue through Sunday.
A recognized authority on botany
and natural history, Professor Ab
rams will include in his address a
brief history of botanical knowledge
of the California mountains.
The first known explorer of the
rich flora of the state was Captain
John C. Fremont, who collected
many species of plants — some of
them rare ones—in about 1840.
Among these plants were Giant
Sequoia seeds, which Fremont sent
from California, their native habitat,
to France and England, where these
trees are now growing. According
to Professor Abrams, the botany of
California is different from that of
the rest of America because "the
climate west of the great divide is
oceanic, whereas that east of it is
continental."
Professor Abrams remarked that
fossils of these Giant Sequoias have
been discovered in strata of plant
life at all times during the last 50 to
70 million years. He also stated that
in ascending the Sierras from the
foothills to the crests one passed
through regions of plant life differ
ing as greatly as that found from
Southern California to Alaska.
