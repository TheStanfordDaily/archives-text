# POLO SEASON CONCLUDED WIH RECORD OF 20 WINS, 2 LOSSES FOR CARD TEAM
## 
### 
Mallets, and other polo equipment
have been shelved for the year sines
Monday's game with Black Foxe
Military Institute, which marked the
end of one of the most successful
seasons any Indian team has expe
rienced in some time, the Redshirts
winning 20 out of the 22 games
played.
As an indication of the wide in
terest taken in polo on the campus,
more than 40 men turned out early
in fall quarter, although a team con
sists of only four.
Led by Luppe Luppen, a formi
dable first string was soon formed,
including two other veterans, Woo
dy Melone and Frank Burns, and a
newcomer. Bill Rogers, who brought
with him much experience from the
south.
The season, which is longer than
that of any other collegiate sport
started on October 27, when Menlo
Circus Club was downed 7 to 1.
Presidio of Monterey and Menlo
J.C. teams proved easy prey, but
Tevis's San Mateo outfit proved al
most too much for the ever improv
ing Indians, who managed to eke
out an 11 to 10 victory.
A Southern invasion over the
Thanksgiving holidays resulted in
the first of the Redshirts' tv/o de
feats, although the pair of games
played against Arizona was split be
tween them.
California was the next victim on
he list, being shut out by a com

bination of first and second string,
by a score of 10 to 0.
A change in rulings giving fresh
men a chance to play brought a
change in the first string, following
the graduation of Melonc in fall
quarter. Russ Rasmussen and Bob
Fullerton were both moved up to
l first string positions, and proved
such a good combination that Frank
Burns was forced to fill a place on
the second string.
This combination of Luppen, Rog
ers, Fullerton, and Rasmussen
played together most of winter and
i spring quarters, losing only one
game, and that by one point to
Tevis's team.
j A summary of the remainder of
the season shows four easy victories
over Oregon State; two of the same
I nature over U.S.C., three over a
| fast-riding Black Foxe four, two
victories and one defeat over Tevis's
outfit; and a second win over the
highly rated Arizona team.
