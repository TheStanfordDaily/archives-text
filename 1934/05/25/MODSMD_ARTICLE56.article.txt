# First Team Wins Grid Scrimmage, 7-0
## GRAYSON TALLIES LONE TOUCHDOWN IN LAST QUARTER Teams Look Good in Only Game of Spring 
### Warren Breed 
Winding up a two-months' spring
practice with GO minutes of real
football, Bobby Grayson's Red 11
won a rather lean victory from a
dogged second-string White team,
7-0. Most everyone in a suit .got in
the game at one time or another,
frequent substitutions and several
minor injuries slowing the game up
to a walk.
Lone score of the afternoon came
at the beginning of the fourth pe
riod. Wes Muller, playing for the
Reds, tackled a White back hard
enough to make him fumble on the
20-yard lint'. Bobby Grayson took
six stabs at. the line to tally the
touchdown.
Gains 12 Yards
Ilis first run, a tearing, slashing
drive, went for 12 yards. On three
subsequent plays he nosed the ball
to within six inches of the goal, as
the third quarter ended. Down at
the other end of the field, a stone
wall met him on his first try, but he
then rammed his way a few feet
across the goal to net the Reds six
points. Monk Moscrip lifted a neat
place-kick over the bars for the ex-
Ira point.
Offensive strength told the tale of
the Red victory. Grayson, Alustiza,
and Reisner made substantial gains
with enough regularity to keep the
second team on the defensive, and
at the same time showing that plenty
of flash and fireworks are in the
offing for the 19114 varsity. When
ever the interference functioned, one
of this tria was off to a gain of five
to 20 yards.
Todd Outsanding
Ray Todd, White full, showed the
only concerted offensive strength of
his team in the second quarter. Wes
Muller, then playing for the Whites,
intercepted a pass from his roving
center post, and the second string
took the ball in midfield. Todd
rammed through four, three, and
seven yards to a first down, and
three more. A startled Red team
look time out, but on the next play
Todd tossed a short pass to halfback
Fred Abbot and a second first down.
Todd again netted five yards off
tackle, but the drive ended there on
the 20-yard stripe as Chuck White
failed to gain and Todd's final for
ward pass fell incomplete.
The soph fullback's trick knee
gave way as he was tackled, and had
to be assisted from the field. Keith
Topping watched the goings-on from
the sidelines, his injured arm tucked
inside his coat. Lyle Smith took his
regular place at first team end.
Ileds Gain
Al the beginning of the second
half, the Reds made an impressive
march, featuring Buck Van Dellen
and Grayson. Van Dellen rang lip
< ight yards around end on the first
play, and Hamilton made it first
down; Grayson, on three running
plays, made another first down.
The line was opening up wide
holes, and Van Dellen tore off three,
followed by a spectacular 16-yard
jaunt by Grayson, aided by effective
interference from the whole team.
It looked for a moment as if the Reds
were off to a score, but Carlos Mon
salve, heady little White flankman,
tossed Grayson for a five-yard loss.
A 20-yard puss from Bobby to Mos
crip was lost when the Red back
held muddled the next play, fum
bled, and the Whites took possession,
of the ball.
Grayson Scorcs
After the White offensive proved
ineffective, Grayson and his mates
went on his way to the touchdown.
Linemen looking good for the Reds
were Smith and Moscrip, ends; Rey
nolds and Lettunich, tackles; Ad
ams and Rouble, guards; Brandin,
center. Whites: Magan, Monsalve,

and Tsoutsouvas, tackles; O'Connor,
Walton, and Black, guards; and Mul
ler and Bergman, centers.

20-yard lint'. Bobby Grayson took
six stabs at. the line to tally the
touchdown.
Gains 12 Yards
Ilis first run, a tearing, slashing
drive, went for 12 yards. On three
subsequent plays he nosed the ball
to within six inches of the goal, as
the third quarter ended. Down at
the other end of the field, a stone
wall met him on his first try, but he
then rammed his way a few feet
across the goal to net the Reds six
points. Monk Moscrip lifted a neat
place-kick over the bars for the ex-
Ira point.
Offensive strength told the tale of
the Red victory. Grayson, Alustiza,
and Reisner made substantial gains
with enough regularity to keep the
second team on the defensive, and
at the same time showing that plenty
of flash and fireworks are in the
offing for the 19114 varsity. When
ever the interference functioned, one
of this tria was off to a gain of five
to 20 yards.
Todd Outsanding
Ray Todd, White full, showed the
only concerted offensive strength of
his team in the second quarter. Wes
Muller, then playing for the Whites,
intercepted a pass from his roving
center post, and the second string
took the ball in midfield. Todd
rammed through four, three, and
seven yards to a first down, and
three more. A startled Red team
look time out, but on the next play
Todd tossed a short pass to halfback
Fred Abbot and a second first down.
Todd again netted five yards off
tackle, but the drive ended there on
the 20-yard stripe as Chuck White
failed to gain and Todd's final for
ward pass fell incomplete.
The soph fullback's trick knee
gave way as he was tackled, and had
to be assisted from the field. Keith
Topping watched the goings-on from
the sidelines, his injured arm tucked
inside his coat. Lyle Smith took his
regular place at first team end.

Al the beginning of the second
half, the Reds made an impressive
march, featuring Buck Van Dellen
and Grayson. Van Dellen rang lip
< ight yards around end on the first
play, and Hamilton made it first
down; Grayson, on three running
plays, made another first down.
The line was opening up wide
holes, and Van Dellen tore off three,
followed by a spectacular 16-yard
jaunt by Grayson, aided by effective
interference from the whole team.
It looked for a moment as if the Reds
were off to a score, but Carlos Mon
salve, heady little White flankman,
tossed Grayson for a five-yard loss.
A 20-yard puss from Bobby to Mos
crip was lost when the Red back
held muddled the next play, fum
bled, and the Whites took possession,
of the ball.
Grayson Scorcs
After the White offensive proved
ineffective, Grayson and his mates
went on his way to the touchdown.
Linemen looking good for the Reds
were Smith and Moscrip, ends; Rey
nolds and Lettunich, tackles; Ad
ams and Rouble, guards; Brandin,
center. Whites: Magan, Monsalve,
and Carlson, ends; Callaway, Drown,
and Tsoutsouvas, tackles; O'Connor,
Walton, and Black, guards; and Mul
ler and Bergman, centers.
Winding up a two-months' spring
practice with GO minutes of real
football, Bobby Grayson's Red 11
won a rather lean victory from a
dogged second-string White team,
7-0. Most everyone in a suit .got in
the game at one time or another,
frequent substitutions and several
minor injuries slowing the game up
to a walk.
