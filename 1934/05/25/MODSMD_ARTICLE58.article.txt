Events for Monday's competition,
which will be held on the football
field, are the sled push, the football
punt, and the baseball throw for dis
tance. Tuesday's events will be held
on Angell Field and the adjacent
soccer field and are the 50-yard

cer kick for accuracy.
Wednesday's Events
The handball serve for distance,
the basketball free throw, and the
50-yard swim to be held in Encina

gym and pools will conclude the
decathlon on Wednesday.
The scoring system to be used in
the decathlon will be similar to that
used in scoring the decathlon in the
Olympic Games. A certain number
of points will be given for a per
formance within a certain range and
events will be graded as to diffi
culty so that a high score in the
easiest event on the program will not
be given the same value as a high
score in the most difficult event.
