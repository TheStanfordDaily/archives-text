NEW INTEREST IN
DECATHLON LOOMS
In this age of specialization there
is no place for a decathlon man, it
seems. But the West Coast this year
is beginning a campaign to recog
nize genera) proficiency.
Next week, Stanford's Ben East
man. Lawson Little, Bill Corbus,
etc., will be forgotten in a mad
scramble for recognition in all
around proficincy as the first annual
All-Sports Decathlon gets under way
with some 50 contenders taking part
in 10 activities, almost as widely
separated as chess and football.
Those 50 athletes will make the
rounds of a push, football punt,
baseball throw for distance, 50-yard
dash, standing broad jump, eight
loot fence climb, soccer kick for ac
curacy, handball serve for distance,
basketball free throw, and a 50-yard
swim, and the chances are that no
one who has ever been out for any
of these sports may win the title.
HAMILTON CHAMPION
IN GRUELLING EVENT
Although not asking quite such a
rounded ability, the track decathlon
rquires as much man per square
inch as any event on the entire
sporting calendar.
With Brutus Hamilton, a former
decathlon champion himself, now di
recting the University of California's
track destiny, this gruelling event
may make a bid for prominence in
California. Hamilton coached Jim
Bausch, 1932 Olympic champion, in
the 10 events, and he is experiment
ing on several Bear athletes.
Hamilton may add a decathlon to
the Pacific Coast open meet program
in Berkeley June 9. At that time
stars from all over the West will be
gathered in the big sectional meet
of the year. Every event from the
100 to the 10,000 meters appears on
the schedule.
STANFORD ENTERS
BE RK ELEY CON TEST
Stanford's seven I C 4-A. repre
sentatives will enter the Berkeley
contest, as will Ben Eastman, Walter
Marty, and Troy's best. Several
eastern middle distance stars have
been tendered invitations. The meet,
to be held in Edwards Stadium, will
serve in building up publicity and
interest in the N.C.A.A. carnival at
Los Angeles two weeks later.
There are still other important ;
trackfests scheduled before the cli- !
matic national collegiates. The Prin- j
ceton invitational on June 16 will j
give several national cinder heroes i
barely time to board a train and j
reach the Los Angeles competition.
Bill Bonthron of Princeton, Charles
liornbostel of Indiana, Glenn Cun
ningham of Kansas, and Eastman
will make a grand scramble for lion- |
ors in the middle distances in New
Jersey. That will be the only time !
this year that all of those champions i
will tangle.
FINAL EXAMS KEEP
JIMMY LUVALLE OUT
Because final examinations will in- ;
terfere, Jimmy LuValle of U.C.L.A. j
was forced to turn down an invita
tion to the Princeton gathering.
Bruin Coach Harry Trotter is just
as happy, though, considering he is
saving his colored Hash for a crack
at the nation's best in the national
collegiate 440. Trotter has been
training LuValle for this meet all
year, and he is now working the ;
1.C.4-A. quarter-mile champion on j
the 220 to build up his sprinting i
speed. —Browne

baseball throw for distance, 50-yard
dash, standing broad jump, eight
loot fence climb, soccer kick for ac
curacy, handball serve for distance,

of these sports may win the title.
HAMILTON CHAMPION
IN GRUELLING EVENT
Although not asking quite such a
rounded ability, the track decathlon
rquires as much man per square
inch as any event on the entire
sporting calendar.
With Brutus Hamilton, a former
decathlon champion himself, now di
recting the University of California's
track destiny, this gruelling event
may make a bid for prominence in
California. Hamilton coached Jim
Bausch, 1932 Olympic champion, in
the 10 events, and he is experiment
ing on several Bear athletes.
Hamilton may add a decathlon to
the Pacific Coast open meet program
in Berkeley June 9. At that time
stars from all over the West will be
gathered in the big sectional meet
of the year. Every event from the
100 to the 10,000 meters appears on
the schedule.
STANFORD ENTERS
BE RK ELEY CON TEST
Stanford's seven I C 4-A. repre
sentatives will enter the Berkeley
contest, as will Ben Eastman, Walter
Marty, and Troy's best. Several
eastern middle distance stars have
been tendered invitations. The meet,
to be held in Edwards Stadium, will
serve in building up publicity and
interest in the N.C.A.A. carnival at
Los Angeles two weeks later.
There are still other important ;
trackfests scheduled before the cli- !
matic national collegiates. The Prin- j
ceton invitational on June 16 will j
give several national cinder heroes i
barely time to board a train and j
reach the Los Angeles competition.
Bill Bonthron of Princeton, Charles
liornbostel of Indiana, Glenn Cun
ningham of Kansas, and Eastman
will make a grand scramble for lion- |
ors in the middle distances in New
Jersey. That will be the only time !
this year that all of those champions i
will tangle.
FINAL EXAMS KEEP
JIMMY LUVALLE OUT
Because final examinations will in- ;
terfere, Jimmy LuValle of U.C.L.A. j
was forced to turn down an invita
tion to the Princeton gathering.
Bruin Coach Harry Trotter is just
as happy, though, considering he is
saving his colored Hash for a crack
at the nation's best in the national
collegiate 440. Trotter has been
training LuValle for this meet all
year, and he is now working the ;
1.C.4-A. quarter-mile champion on j
the 220 to build up his sprinting i
speed. —Browne
NEW INTEREST IN
DECATHLON LOOMS
In this age of specialization there
is no place for a decathlon man, it
seems. But the West Coast this year
is beginning a campaign to recog
nize genera) proficiency.
Next week, Stanford's Ben East
man. Lawson Little, Bill Corbus,
etc., will be forgotten in a mad
scramble for recognition in all
around proficincy as the first annual
All-Sports Decathlon gets under way
with some 50 contenders taking part
in 10 activities, almost as widely
separated as chess and football.
Those 50 athletes will make the
rounds of a push, football punt,
baseball throw for distance, 50-yard
dash, standing broad jump, eight
loot fence climb, soccer kick for ac
curacy, handball serve for distance,
basketball free throw, and a 50-yard
