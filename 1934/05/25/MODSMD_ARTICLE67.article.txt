# LITTLE WINS TWO MORE MATCHES IN BRITISH AMATEUR
## Indian Golf Star Advances To Quarter-Finals 
### 
Lawson Little, SLani'ord's number
one golfer and star of the American
Walker cup victory, advanced into
the quarter-finals of the British
Amateur Championship yesterday,
defeating two British veterans by
decisive margins, an Associated Press
dispatch announced.
Besides Little the only other
American remaining in the running
today is George Dunlap, Jr., Ameri
can amateur title holder. John
Goodman, open champion, and Jesse
Guilford, former amateur champion,
fell before the sensational play of
two English "unknowns." *
Wins Both Handily
Little, keeping up his steady brand
of near-par golf of the last four
days, took both his matches in de
si ve fashion. Lionel Munn, 47-year
old Irish veteran, went down before
Little in the morning by u margin
of 3 and 2. The Stanford star was
only three over par in this match.
Then in the afternoon he completed
his double header win by downing
Gordon Peters, 25-year-old player
from Glasgow to the tune of 4 and 3.
As usual, Little's tremendous drives
gave him a decided edge in both
matches, and especially on the last
nine of the famous old Prestwick
course which are of backbreaking
length.
To Meet '33 Finalist
Today Little plays T. A. Bourn,
last year finalist, while Dunlap meets
Alex Walker. The other matches
are between Wallace and F. Francis,
and Garnett and John Neal.
Goodman, favorite of the American
contenders, barely won his morning
round yesterday and went down to
defeat in the afternoon before a gal
lery of 8,000 persons at the hands of
Leslie Garnett, a little known Eng
lishman. The Prince of Wales fol
lowed the match through its entire
81 holes.
