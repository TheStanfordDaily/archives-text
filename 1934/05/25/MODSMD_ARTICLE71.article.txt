# MONDAY ENDS FIRST ROUND MATCHES IN MIXED DOUBLES TENNIS TOURNEY
## 
### 
Five first-round matches in the
mixed doubles tennis tournament
must be played by Monday, May 28.
If weather conditions are favorable,
these matches should all be played
today, so as to allow second-round
competition to start on schedule.
These five clashes are as follows:
Hanna-Ransom vs. Shelton-Taylor,
Wakefield - Goldstein vs. Pearce-
Seward, Kesting - Shwayder vs.
Buckwalter-partnor, Kay-Johnston
vs. Gruenberg-partner, and Swaf
ford-Bogan vs. Richter-Gray.
All mixed doubles matches should
be played on the varsity courts, if
possible, as these courts will be
available for at least four or five
matches a day. In addition to the
default confronting teams which fail
to complete their first-round match
es by Monday, there is a require
ment that all second-round matches
which can be played should be set
tled early next week, if not sooner.
Although the outcome of this
tournament is doubtful because of
the handicaps, the favored teams

consist of Margaret Diedrich and
Chuck Otis, who defeated Mary
Mayer and John. Cahill this week;
Eliisabeth Kcsting, star transfer, and
Monty Shwayder, defending co
champion; Betty Pearce and Bill
Sew aid; and the teams of Alice
Philp-Ben Dey and Dorothy Anne
Jackson-Glenn Reed, both of which
pairs drew first-round byes. The
woman on the winning team will be
awarded a tennis racket by a Palo
Alto merchant.
