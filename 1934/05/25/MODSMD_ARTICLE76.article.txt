ter of ceremonies, introducing the

President Ray Lyman Wilbur,
walking in during the goings-on,
said that he thought he was at a
meeting of Phi Beta Kappa, until
he saw some of the more illustrious
alumni, then he knew he was wrong.
His audience was all ears as he re
lated that from the showing of tho
team yesterday afternoon in the final
scrimmage, he looked for a Big Game
victory next fall, and seemed elated
at Stanford grid prospects.
Head Coach Tiny Thornhill, in his
usual good-natured, hearty style,
ventured his opinion that every team
in the conference would probably
lose at least one game, Stanford no
exception. He hopes, of course, that
he will lead his boys to an unde
feated season, but with the hardest
schedule in the conference, even his
"swell team" may slip oncq,
One hundred and fifty people or
thereabouts attended the dinner,
which followed the final scrimmage
of the spring training season, in
which the first team eked out a single
touchdown to beat second-stringers.
