# QUAD INSTALLMENTS DUE NEXT THURSDAY
## Only a Limited Number Of Books Left Unsold 
### 
To avoid delay in obtaining a
Quad on Wednesday when it makes
its campus appearance, all install
ments should be paid by Tuesday,
declares Business Manager Hal
Whitfield.
As there are only a limited num
ber of copies remaining for sale,
Whitfield advises the immediate
purchase of the book by all those
who have not as yet obtained cop
ies. The price is $5.65, or $6.15 with
a name engraved on the cover.
If a name is to be put on the
cover, the order should be in today
at the latest in order to receive the
book when it is distributed Wed
nesday. Quad representatives will
be in front of the Post Office from
8 to 12 o'clock today, Monday, and
Tuesday to take orders.
Three advance copies of the Quad
will be put on display in the Li
brary this week-end, so that the
outstanding quality of the work may
be seen.
