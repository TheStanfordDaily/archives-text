# HOOVER WAR ROOM SHOWS POSTERS OF 1914 PROPAGANDA
## German Consul's Collection Featured in Exhibit 
### 
Representing colorful examples of
war and peace propaganda, a display
of posters from the Hoover War Li
brary opens today in the Stanford
Art Gallery as an exhibit designed
especially for the A.A.U.W. confer
ence here this week-end.
The posters are mounted in groups
according to their appeal upon hu
man emotions. Patriotism, the spirit
of sacrifice, the rousing of hatred, as
well as appeals to women and to
immigrants arc played upon in the
various groups which include ex
amples of the war propaganda of the
Allies and the Central Powers.
Illustrative of the spreading of
propaganda is a collection of vari
ous printings of the memoranda of
Prince Lichnowsky, German ambas
sador to Great Britain at the opening
of the War, which became public
and were published, not without
many distortions, in many different
languages because they contained
some anti-German statements.
Though it will be used as an ex
ample in a conference discussion on
war and peace, the display will re
main up until June 3. It was planned
and mounted by Miss Nina McLean,
head of the War Library, and Philip
T. McLean, a member of the Library
staff.
