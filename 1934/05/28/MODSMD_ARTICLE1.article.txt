# FULLENWIDER IN SPORTS DISPUTE VERSUS GRAVES
## Circle 'S' Proposition Expected to Come Before Student Body This Week as Ex Committee Gets Petition Tomorrow Night 
### 
Should a third-year Circle "S" man be awarded a Block "S7" That
question, which has been fought out in many proposed-constitution battles
during the last four months, will probably come before a student body vote
sometime this week with the presentation of a vote-requesting petition of
150 signatures to the Ex Committee tomorrow night by Frank Fullenwidcr.
Opposition to the athletic by-laws passed by the Ex Committee last
Tuesday night which provided for the block award to a minor sports man
instead of his third Circle "S" award has developed among some of the
major sport men.

Frank Fullenwidcr, varsity track l
man, says:
"Among my reasons for opposing
the plan to give blocks to Circlemen
is that at present a block stands for
a definite thing—an award in foot
ball, track, baseball, basketball, or
tennis. A circle stands for an award
in the other sports. There is nothing
inherently supezior in either. By
asking for blocks the Circlemen are
just attempting to put themselves in
a class to which they do not belong.
Circlemen Divided
It's like giving the trackmen gold
footballs. Indeed, there is a feeling
among many Circlemen that a white
three-year circle award is definitely
superior to a first-year block award
and don't like to be forced into tak
ing the latter.
"Admittedly some few Circlemen
put in as much work as Blockmen,
but they get their own award. Why
should they want another's? If work
is the only criteria, how about "goof"
footballmen and the host of others,
both block and circle, who turn out
for three years and get their reward
in the fun of the sport.
Work a Bad Criteria
"I think it must be conceded ihat
if blocks are to be given for work
alone about one-third of the men
would be eligible and the award
would cease to have any significance
cither on or off the campus.
"The Circlemen have made a great
point out of their doubles tennis
players, relay runners, etc., getting
blocks. But this plan admits that
one of these is worth three of theirs.
They better stick to their own
awards.
" 'How did you make your block?'
'Oh, I'm a three-year man on the
flying trapeze.' Nuts."
Graves' Statement
Gordy Graves, ex-captain of the
water polo team, who would not be
affected by change, due to the fact
that he has already received his third
award, says: "If this year may be
used as an indication of what wili
happen in the future, the proposed
ruling, allowing a Block 'S' for their
third Circle 'S»' would mean about 10
men each year would receive those
awards. Since the awards in most
of the minor sports are made in the
spring quarter, those men would be
able to wear their blocks for only
about two months.
"Therefore, the number of letters
on the campus would not be mate
rially increased. Nearly all the men
who won three circles this year arc
Pacific Coast intercollegiate cham
pions, and certainly deserve as much
recognition as a high jumper who
ties for third in the Cal meet. We
are glad to sec the rule go before the
student body because if the majority
of the students do not want the
change then the minor sports men
arc not in favor of it either."

should they want another's? If work
is the only criteria, how about "goof"
footballmen and the host of others,
both block and circle, who turn out
for three years and get their reward
in the fun of the sport.
Work a Bad Criteria
"I think it must be conceded ihat
if blocks are to be given for work
alone about one-third of the men
would be eligible and the award
would cease to have any significance
cither on or off the campus.
"The Circlemen have made a great
point out of their doubles tennis
players, relay runners, etc., getting
blocks. But this plan admits that
one of these is worth three of theirs.
They better stick to their own
awards.
" 'How did you make your block?'
'Oh, I'm a three-year man on the
flying trapeze.' Nuts."
Graves' Statement
Gordy Graves, ex-captain of the
water polo team, who would not be
affected by change, due to the fact
that he has already received his third
award, says: "If this year may be
used as an indication of what wili
happen in the future, the proposed
ruling, allowing a Block 'S' for their
third Circle 'S»' would mean about 10
men each year would receive those
awards. Since the awards in most
of the minor sports are made in the
spring quarter, those men would be
able to wear their blocks for only
about two months.
"Therefore, the number of letters
on the campus would not be mate
rially increased. Nearly all the men
who won three circles this year arc
Pacific Coast intercollegiate cham
pions, and certainly deserve as much
recognition as a high jumper who
ties for third in the Cal meet. We
are glad to sec the rule go before the
student body because if the majority
of the students do not want the
change then the minor sports men
arc not in favor of it either."
Should a third-year Circle "S" man be awarded a Block "S7" That
question, which has been fought out in many proposed-constitution battles
during the last four months, will probably come before a student body vote
sometime this week with the presentation of a vote-requesting petition of
150 signatures to the Ex Committee tomorrow night by Frank Fullenwidcr.
Opposition to the athletic by-laws passed by the Ex Committee last
Tuesday night which provided for the block award to a minor sports man
instead of his third Circle "S" award has developed among some of the
major sport men.

Frank Fullenwidcr, varsity track l
man, says:
"Among my reasons for opposing
the plan to give blocks to Circlemen
is that at present a block stands for
a definite thing—an award in foot
ball, track, baseball, basketball, or
tennis. A circle stands for an award
in the other sports. There is nothing
inherently supezior in either. By
asking for blocks the Circlemen are
just attempting to put themselves in
a class to which they do not belong.
Circlemen Divided
It's like giving the trackmen gold
footballs. Indeed, there is a feeling
among many Circlemen that a white
three-year circle award is definitely
superior to a first-year block award
and don't like to be forced into tak
ing the latter.
"Admittedly some few Circlemen
put in as much work as Blockmen,
but they get their own award. Why
should they want another's? If work
is the only criteria, how about "goof"
footballmen and the host of others,
