# MUST AMERICA CHANGE?

### SPENCER THOMPSON 
Thii series of Ihree articles is being presented by the Daily with the idea of acquainting readers with
current trends in world political and social affairs. While the Daily is, in a sense, parting from its policy of
having nothing but campus news features, it is felt that the discussion by Mr. Thompson is close enough
to affect every student on the Farm.

January, 1933, the papers were
full of accounts of big excitement in
Germany. A man named Hitler with
a black moustache and a brown shirt j
was in control.
Storm troopers rushed through
the healing up all those that
displeased them: professors, students,
progressives, workers, socialists, and
communists.
There were two classes in Ger- I
many: those who favored Hitler and j
those who did not. The more mili
tant of the opposition were sent to J
concentration camps, thoroughly j
beaten up at irregular intervals, |
some were injected with syphilis j
germs.
Many were given the "Mussolini j
Persuader," a quart of caslor-oil,
which is more than an embarrass- j
ment in that quantity, and dehy
drates the vital organs, leaving the
victim a physical wreck for life. But,
castor-oil is incidental to fascism,
one of its lesser though more an- i
noying aspects.
The problem in Germany, like the ,
recent and present problem in
America, was a depression. Germany
is a great producer of manufactured
goods. She must export. Bui Gei

many, in the last five years, ha. 1 -
found a world depression, mounting
tariff walls. She could not export.
Production was curtailed, and un
employment mounted. Germany
could not sell her goods at home at
a profit, and she could not sell them
abroad at a profit. Unemployment
mounted further. The splendid sys
tem of German unemployment in
surance began to break in 1931, as
German banks and German credit
began to crumble.
The common people were becom
ing desperate because many were
starving. The capitalists became des
perate to save their vast holdings,
because the people were becoming
desperate.
Two new parties rose to the fore.
The workers and artisans became
communists and Germany has six
million "reds." They were growing
at every election.
Adolph Hitler, mouthing hate at
France, and full of promises of u
great Germany, was casting his de
nagogic spell over many people,
those who were afraid of communism
and disgusted with the depression.
German capital realized that the
handsome Adolph was a splendid

, tool to save themselves. They used
him, and ;is they contributed mil
lions of uniform Nazis, and carry
: out election campaigns, Hitler was
happy to be used.
The people bit, and while a large
group wavered, Hitler took control.
! The labor and liberal elements were
driven to cover. The big capitalists
ruled.
Sops were given to laborers at first
in form of profit-sharing. Then with
power firm and organization com
plete, the crack-down came, and
more is coming. Labor unions were
smashed. * Book-burning became a
! nat ional past-time. Then wages were
cut. Prices for essentials were raised,
j The standard of living was pushed
lower and lower.
Fascism must give greater profits
to those who control it or it is a fail
ure. Il will succeed in Germany,
j How? Germany to compete abroad
mu! I cut cost. Costs will be cut by
| cutting wages.
Willi costs reduced, profits mount,
Fascism succeeds. Of course after
a while, the people get. tired of po
tatoes, get wise to all this sort of
ihing, but that is another story, a
jstory of the future.
