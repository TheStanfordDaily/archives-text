# Stanford Star Breaks All Records to Capture British Amateur
## BLOCK "S" IS AWARDED Will Enter American Open In Two Weeks 
### M. Jack Newman 
As the first excitement over Law- '
son Little's great triumph in British
and Amateur Golf Championship at
Preswick, Scotland, calmed down,
Stanford and San Francisco have
turned their thoughts toward hon
oring their most recent son to win
world fame.
The Stanford Board of Athletic
Control has decided to give him a
Block "S" that is awarded in golf
only for a great achievement of this
type. Denied this award a few
months ago v/hen the Board de
cided that his winning his way to
the semi - finals of the National
Amateur twice was not enough to
justify his receiving it, Little has
now achieved another of his goals.
The assurance of the award was
given by Graduate Manager A1 Mas
ters yesterday.
Wire Praises
San Francisco civic leaders, in
cluding Mayor Angelo Rossi and
Northern California Golf Association
President Horace Guittard, wired
their congratulations to him at
Preswick yesterday, and began to
make plans for a civic welcome for
him on his return to San Francisco.
Due to the fact that the National
Open Golf Tournament will be held
in two weeks, Little is not remain
ing in England for the British Open
in an effort to emulate the clean
sweep made by Bobby Jones in
1930. The playing of the American
Open will also delay Little's return
to the Pacific Coast until the end
of June.
Team May Go East
There is a great deal of specula
tion at the present time as to whe
ther or not the Board of Athletic
Control will send a team East to
meet Little and play in the National
Intercollegiates which will be played
in Cleveland on the 21st of June.
A tentative team of those who have
volunteered to go and pay their
traveling expenses are: Charles De
Brettville, Jack Horner, and Bob
Welch.
Still uncertain if they will go
when afforded the chance are Don
Edwards, Tom Dyer, and Spec
Stewart. The Intercollegiates allow
eight men to play but count only
the low four from every college that
enters. Stanford, though with teams
rated with any of the Eastern col
leges, has never competed in the
biggest intercollegiate tournament.
Twiggs Pleased
On the campus great admiration
of Little's feat was expressed by
everyone. Coach Eddie Twiggs, un
der whose tutelage he prepared his
game for the English weather con
ditions, said, "Little deserved to
win. It was gi'eat, and he has
proven himself one of the greatest
competitors I have ever known. It
seems that he plays better in the
bigger tournaments. In these local
tournaments it was sometimes hard
to distinguish his game from the
others on the squad."
Adam Kutz, the Scotch caddie
master who has watched Stanford
golfers come and go since the build
ing of the course, observed: "Little's
win was a great thing. Yesterday
was a glorious day for Stanford."
The chief object of admiration was
the fact that in the shooting of his
record-breaking score Little used
only .'l2 putts in 23 holes, 14 under
average.
