# Rally for Seven Track Winners Waits Approval
## 
### 
An all-University rally for
Stanford's 1.C.4-A. champion
ship track team will probably
be held Wednesday morning on
the Indians' return to their na
tive tepee, according to Stan
Beaubaire, rally committee
chairman, who is applying to
authorities for permission to
greet the triumphant seven.
If plans carry, a large group
of students will meet the track
sters at the railroad station as
they get off the train, parade
through Palo Alto, and then
bring the team to the English
corner, where the rally will
take place.
Both Beaubaire and Jimmy
Triolo declared that the return
ing team should receive an ova
tion as the result of their
achievement.
