# Senior Party Held Tonight
## Skating Affair Adds to List Of Farm Traditions 
### 
Supplementing Stanford's fast
dying collection of traditions, the
senior class skating party will be in
augurated tonight as a new event in
the history of the University. Glee
ful seniors will glide through the
inner and outer Quad from 7:30 to
10 p.m. under the light of a full
moon.
Skates will be available in Room
300 at the Engineering Building any
time after 7:30 o'clock to all seniors
holding dues receipts cards. The
rental will be 25 cents. Ice cream is
to be served in the inner Quad at
8:30, and will be free to skaters pre
senting their dues cards.
Due to the great amount of inter
est shown and the fact that only 200
skates will be available, grads-to-be
are advised to get there early. Skates
must be turned in at Room 300 not
later than 10 o'clock.
An invitation is extended to fac
ulty members to join the skating
party. They will be furnished skates
by the senior class.
Precautions will be taken to pi"e
vent injury to any of the skaters.
The English corner will be roped off,
and ropes will be placed around the
psychology corner. All parties ac
cepting roller skates do so with the
understanding Stanford University,
the senior class, and the A.S.S.U.
will not accept any responsibility
for personal damage or injury.
Skaters are asked to stay clear of
the English corner so that frosh in
the Citizenship Library will be able
to continue with their studies. The
corner will be blocked off, and skat
ers are asked not to go inside the
ropes.
There will be a meeting of the
social'committee in Room 300 in the
Engineering Building at 5 o'clock
this afternoon. All members are
asked to be present.
