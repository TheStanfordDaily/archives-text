### Millard Browne 
With the 38th annual Intercolle
giate A.A.A.A. track and field cham
pionship as a token of their final ap
pearance in the Philadelphia national
competition, seven victorious Stan
ford Cardinals arrive on the Farm
Wednesday morning.
After overcoming several heart
breaking upsets early in the meet,
the seven Indians came through to
a smashing triumph Saturday Stan
ford amassed a total of 35V4 points,
as compared to 25Vi for Yale, and 20
for California.
Two skeleton teams from the
West, with seven and five represen
tatives in the national meet, took
two of the first three team places,
and won seven events out of a pos
sible 15.
Cards Quit 1.C.4-A.
In spite of a determined Eastern
resistance, Stanford made it a big
year as she dropped from further
1.C.4-A. competition, and regained a
championship that had been lost to
Troy five years ago.
The meet opened Friday disas
trously for Stanford, as Sam Klop
stock tripped over a hurdle in the
high barrier semi-finals and failed to
qualify. This followed a minor dis
appointment when Chuck Nimmo
failed to place in the 800-meter trial
heat.
Then the Saturday program was
opened with Johnny Mottram getting
but a second in the javelin after he
had been figured for a near-cinch
victory. And Nimmo placed in a no
point ninth position in the mile.
Lyman Takes Shot
But this was the end of Cardinal
bad breaks until after the meet had
been clinched.
Johnny Lyman and Slinger Dunn
began the parade with a more or less
expected one-two in the shot-put
and A1 Blackmail quickly added a
first place in the 400-meters to boost
the point total to 18.
The turning point of the meet fol
lowed. Dunn and Lyman were an
nounced as going one-two in the dis
cus after they had been figured in
advance dope-sheets for third and
fourth behind a pair of Harvard
stars.
Discus Replaces Hurdles
Those added discus points made
up for the possible five Klopstock
lost in the hurdles, and left Stan
ford, already claiming enough poinis
to win the meet, still well reprc
sehted in three remaining events.
The sophomore hurdle sensation
made up for his earlier misfortune
and sailed over 200 meters of low
sticks to five more digits in 24.2 sec
onds.
Another of the meet's major sur
prises was forthcoming as Blackman
grabbed a third in the 200-meter
dash. The newly-crowned 400-meter
champion finished surprisingly close
to California's Bullet Bob Kiesel,
who won the race in the exceptional
-muddy-track time of 20.9 seconds
for a new meet record.
Deacon Tries for Fifth
By this time, with the meet
cinched, it made little difference
that Deacon succeeded in gathering
but a four-way tic for fifth in the
pole vault.
Lyman twice broke his own meet
record and finally smashed the ac
knowledged world's mark in the
shot-put. The consistent blond Phi
Beta put the ball 53 feet 2 :! .j inches.
