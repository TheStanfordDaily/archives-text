The suggestion advanced by the Women's Council
Friday that the old system of lapping on desks to stop
cheating in examinations be reinstalled is one worthy 6f
thought.
With the sudden entrance of nearly 2000 new students
fast fall, the I'niversitv had a dillicult problem breaking
them in to the ways of Stanford. The Honor Code, a re
vered tradition on this campus, came in for its share of
the losses of face with the result that both Women's and
Men's Councils were confronted with trying situations.
Consequently, the Honor Code is on the spot. Rumors have
if that, if the situation does not improve, students may be
put back 011 the old. disliked proctor system.
Wherever possible, it is much better to let the students
decide their own remedies. The Women's Council has seen
the need for action and made the suggestion to the stu
dents that, whenever anybody is seen cheating in an exam
ination, the person seeing the cribbing start tapping on his
desk and that everybody else take up the tapping imme
diately.
This is a solution to the problem. If the students do
not wfsh to be watched like convicts in a courtyard, they
had belter awaken to the fact that it will take teamwork
to pull this wagon out of the mire.
