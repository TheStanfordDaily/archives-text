# The 						Mills of the Law

### 
Tliirtv-threo days ago litis morning the lifeless body of
Peter Jewett was found on the Stanford campus. Those
thirty-three have been days of curious, unbelievable in
action on the part of the civil authorities whose duties are
to investigate, arrest, charge, try, exonerate, convict, clear,
;uid explain death and murder mysteries.
Ostensibly, a life lias been taken, whether bv design or
accident, whether murderously or innocently, no one
knows. Why we cannot have some concerted effort to re
veal these answers, remains a greater mystery than the
original death itself.
The Men's and Women's Councils are supposedly "in
vestigating." District Attorney Amos Williams of Santa
Clara County is supposed to be "investigating," or at least
he declared that further "investigating" was necessary,
following the inquest held May 12, fully two weeks after
the death!
What is the matter with the prosecuting and police or
ganizations of San Mateo and Santa Clara counties? Why
do they not decide under whose jurisdiction the Jewett
death lies and then proceed rapidly and proficiently to
clean up this mystery that has hung, to the consternation
of all concerned, over the Stanford campus for a month?
Do these "investigators" purpose to drag things out
until a vacation breakup takes the key witness away from
Satna Clara county, into other districts and states where
upon the difficulties of "investigation" will be increased
tenfold ?
The Daily has waited patiently for the rusty wheels ot
justice to operate, waited to see cleared the names oi the
Stanford men and women who are involved, expectant
daily of seeing some substance ot accomplishment; and,
seeing nothing done, has decided that it is high time some
one got off the proverbial dime.
Indeed, the mills of the law grind slowly, and none too
line at that.
