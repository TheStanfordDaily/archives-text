THE RI LE OF ORDER— 1
AND THE RULE OF DISORDER
There are two ways to settle a
dispute: the peaceful way and the
violent way. Strikes can be either
violent or peaceful. A perfectly
conducted strike would be entirely |
peaceful. But most strikes are not
perfectly organized; when they are |
not they get violent sooner or later.
This is wiiat i.s now happening to !
strikes all over the country; all of
them are really violent—on the idea
that the end justifies the means.
The basic demand behind most of
these strikes i.s for the "closed shop ,
(no non-union members hired). La
bor claims it must have the closed
shop to be on equal footing with ;
business. Many labor leaders say
there has been a government of or
ganized business, so why not have
one of organized labor, too.
WHAT THE NRA GIVES—
AND WHAT IT DOESN'T
Strikers say the NRA guarantees !
the closed shop. Employers say it |
doesn't. All the NRA says is that an j
employer must meet Vith the repre
sentatives of his employees to talk
about wages, etc. It does NOT say
that workmen must join a union to
bargain with their employers for
their wages.
In San Francisco both sides of the
longshoremen's- shipping companies
strike are determined not to budge
an inch from their demands. If la
bor wants the closed shop and the
employers don't and neither will
give in, the question will be settled

by force if it is not settled by arbi
tration or by law.
For the sake of peace in the future
the only thing to do is to unionize
the longshoremen and have the em
ployers agree to the closed shop. If
this is not done by law, the govern
ment will have to sit back and see it
done by force.
The employers' threats to break
the strike by violence may succeed.
But the problem will be back in the
future—bigger than ever. So the
thing ought to be done now and
done peacefully.
GOVERNMENT MUST BE
GREATER THAN LABOR
OR CAPITAL
But if labor wins these strikes it
will be ton powerful to run around
loose without any regulation. Dur
ing its growing-up stages American
unionism wanted just what Ameri
can business wanted in its competi
tive stage—the right to be let alone,
with the government to keep it from
being molested. The right disap
peared for business when business
outgrew the competitive stage. It
will disappear for labor when it gets
too big.
If the closed shop wins out, the
strike will have to go. If labor were
to have both, it would be too power
ful. It would be almost as strong as
the government. Since there is room
for only one government in one
place at one time, labor will no
lunger be able to strike. If labor
still wants the strike and violence,
the government will have to use vio
. knee and crush labor.
