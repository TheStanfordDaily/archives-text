## CATHERINE THE GREAT 
### 
(London Films)
At the Mountain View Thcafre
When the toll of the year's best
films is taken at the end of 1934, it is
safe to predict that "Catherine the
Great" will occupy a secure and
prominent position.
Directed by Alexander Korda, who
made "Henry the Eighth," the film
is in almost every way superior to
its excellent predecessor. Histori
cally, it is neither more nor less
accurate, but the emphasis is wisely
not placed on any single phase of
the life of the Russian Empress. The
comedy is less forced, and where
"Henry" offered but one superlative
performance, the current lilm offers
three.
Elizabeth Bergner, long the toast
of Europe, is magnificent as Cath
erine. Small in stature and in voice,
Miss Bergner makes the Empress a
powerful characterization, simply by
Acting. Hers is an inspired perform
ance, one which has seldom been
equalled on the screen.
In less august company, Douglas
Fairbanks, Jr., and Flora Robson
would appear more remarkable, but
as it is, they both contribute fine
performances. Fairbanks, as the
Czar, does his best work, making no
attempt to soften an unsympathetic
character. Miss Robson is splendid
as the Empress Elizabeth.
With so many assets, one might
overlook an absence of plot, but
"Catherine the Great" tells excel
lently well the very moving story of
Catherine's unfortunate marriage to
Peter, and interest is constantly sus
stained.
In short, an important picture.
