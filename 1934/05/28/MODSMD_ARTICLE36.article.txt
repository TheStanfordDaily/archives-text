# THE 						TRUMPET BLOWS

(Paramount)
At the Varsity Theatre
Family or femme? that's the hor
rible problem facing George Raft hi
this horrible picture. First comes
brother, then, after some prelimi
nary queening to demonstrate Raft's
versatility at the game, comes love
(Frances Drake), then comes broth
er, then comes love, then, as the
piece de resistance pi this dramatic
sandwich, comes bull-fighting, for
the locale of this tremendous drama
is border Mexico. The climax takes
place in the bull-ring, and was it
ever appropriate!
All this while brother (Adolphe
Menjou) is doing some fancy hem
mingways all by himself; first we
think he's Pancho Gomez the ter
rible bandit, then we don't, then we
do, and then we don't and then the
director pulls a fastv. He suddenly
remembers a playwright called liiel
Coward and has Pancho Gomez,
brother bull-fighter, and the love
all leave together to live happily
ever after, or something.
MANDALAY (Warner Brothers)
Geographical variety is the key
note of the program, for with this
production we flash from bull-rings
to oriental dancing girls. Kay Fran
cis demonstrates her ability to wear
clothes even in unmentionable ori
ental entertainment spots, and al
most succeeds in making a trite plot
interesting.
Lyle Talbot, and Ricardo Cortez
are consistent and convincing, but
so what? The whole affair is just so
much time wasted, unless you en
joy watching Kay Francis and like
the song she sings four or five times
about love coming tomorrow with
bigger dividends. —Brill
