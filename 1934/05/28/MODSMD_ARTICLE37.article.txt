# ROBINSON FINDS NO HARM INHERENT IN "ALPHABET SOUP"
## 
### Cedric Larson 
Professor Edgar E. Robinson, ex
ecutive head of Stanford History de
partment, and author of "The Evo
lution of American Political Parties",
does not believe that the present
phenomena of the "alphabetical et
ceteras" of boards and commissions
in our national government consti
tutes a denial of democracy.
"If we believe that democracy is
only represented through legislative
agencies, a growth in commissions is
a step away from democracy", says
Professor Robinson. "If, on the other
hand, we believe that making a
small body of men directly respon
sible to the executive is a more effi
cient way of achieving action in the
general interest, one would be led
to conclude that commissions are a
more effective way to achieve demo
cracy".
Congress Power Hit
A small body of experts furnishes
a superior means of finding facts.
When the commission's report is in,
the problem is twofold: First, to
arouse public interest through a
campaign of publicity and educa
tion; second, to get an elective gov
ernment to carry out the recommen
dations of a selective board.
Congress is loath to delegate
powers to commissions, because such
a course inevitably causes a corre
sponding shrinkage in congressional
control.
Considers Workable
"Democracy per se is workable and
desirable", concludes Professor Roh
inson. "However, we must have not
only faith in democracy, but a rea
soned belief. Democracy is the
safest and surest road to effective
and satisfactory government only
when we cease to worship it, hut
seek to understand it, and make it
work through active interest. Com
missions are a step in this direction."
