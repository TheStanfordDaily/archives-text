AIRLINES — More than 60 million
persons listen to dance music broad
casts daily, but do any of these per
sons ever realize the time and ex
pense the networks spend picking
the best and most distinctive bands
from among the more than eight
thousand scattered throughout the
country?
Each orchestra is picked for its
distinctive characteristics, and no
two are alike, having developed
styles all their own that defy imita
tion, These distinguishing qualities
are not hard to define, and some of
the more pre-eminent organization?
could be signified as:
Isham Jones — the essence of
blending and sophistication. Paul
Whiteman — symphonic jazz with
Wagnerian deliberation. Richard
Himber — smooth, sophisticated le
gato. Don Bestor —dignified inter
pretations. Guy Lombardo — the
acme of good dance music. Jimmy
Lunceford—the exponent of torrid,
African rhythms.
Wayne King — lilting Viennese
touch of Strauss in jazz. Jack Denny
—jazz without jarring notes. Eddie
Duchin —smooth, high-hat sophisti
cation in a jazz tempo. Enric Madri
guerra—romantic tango idiom. Gus
Arnheim—melodic treatment of per
fect rhythms. Ted Fio-Rito, weird
effects to obtain the best novelty or

AIRLINES — More than 60 million
persons listen to dance music broad
casts daily, but do any of these per
sons ever realize the time and ex
pense the networks spend picking
the best and most distinctive bands
from among the more than eight
thousand scattered throughout the
country?
Each orchestra is picked for its
distinctive characteristics, and no
two are alike, having developed
styles all their own that defy imita
tion, These distinguishing qualities
are not hard to define, and some of
the more pre-eminent organization?
could be signified as:
Isham Jones — the essence of
blending and sophistication. Paul
Whiteman — symphonic jazz with
Wagnerian deliberation. Richard
Himber — smooth, sophisticated le
gato. Don Bestor —dignified inter
pretations. Guy Lombardo — the
acme of good dance music. Jimmy
Lunceford—the exponent of torrid,
African rhythms.
Wayne King — lilting Viennese
touch of Strauss in jazz. Jack Denny
—jazz without jarring notes. Eddie
Duchin —smooth, high-hat sophisti
cation in a jazz tempo. Enric Madri
guerra—romantic tango idiom. Gus
Arnheim—melodic treatment of per
fect rhythms. Ted Fio-Rito, weird
effects to obtain the best novelty or
chestrations.
