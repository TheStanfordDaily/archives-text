# BULL SESSION
## GETTING UNDER THE EPIDERMIS 
### 
Fooling most ox the people all ot
the tijne is one of the most grandiose
and widespread of all occupations.
The baby, cooing and babbling in his
nurse's arms, is given a nipple and
made to believe it is the real thing.
And from then on, until the lime he
is promised Heaven when everybody
knows he is headed for Hell, the in
dividual is perpetually duped.
So essential, is it to make people
believe things that are not so, that
there are individuals who specialize
in the art. The practice is known by
a thousand names: e.g., "lying,"
"selling oneself," "educating," etc.
Almost every success is built upon
a ipajor or minor perfection of the
art. True, a few people get by with
building better mousetraps; but for
every successful builder of better
mousetraps, there are a hundred
successes founded on selling mouse
traps as rat-traps, flower-pots, and
soup-strainers. The art is only cas
ually a business practice. The science
of deception flowers into lull bloom
in the realm of government.

! Thus, men are made to vote for
real reform —and are given shoddy.
I They are made to fight for sterling
I idealism, and are given tarnished
1 realism. Fishermen, sitting on a
1 barge and reeling in catch after
i catch, are sometimes tempted to
| speculate on why the fish never get
; wise. But a mackerel or perch was
| never hooked as badly as the fish
! erman. The fish at least puts up a
j fight, when he knows he is caught.
| The fisherman never knows.
Most men are hooked by their
vanity—the most delicate and over
| worked sensitivity in the human
| body. Nationalist leaders make
| ditchdiggers think they are superior

people. Politicians flatter the popu
lace into believing it is the cream
and the flower of the land. The re
sult is not only vanity, but smuij
vanity—a most delightful combina
i tion.
So what? Vanity being what it is,
and people being what they are,
people may be just as easily duped
into voting and thinking right as
j wrong. A group of San Francisco
| clubwomen —with their pictures on
: a full page spread in a metropolitan
daily—have recently endorsed un
employment insurance. Vanity, like
rubber bands, may be pulled in both
•directions. There is nothing wrong
with vanity; it has just been mis
used. Vanity is a good thing.

Fooling most ox the people all ot
the tijne is one of the most grandiose
and widespread of all occupations.
The baby, cooing and babbling in his
nurse's arms, is given a nipple and
made to believe it is the real thing.
And from then on, until the lime he
is promised Heaven when everybody
knows he is headed for Hell, the in
dividual is perpetually duped.
So essential, is it to make people
believe things that are not so, that
there are individuals who specialize
in the art. The practice is known by
a thousand names: e.g., "lying,"
"selling oneself," "educating," etc.
Almost every success is built upon
a ipajor or minor perfection of the
art. True, a few people get by with
building better mousetraps; but for
every successful builder of better
mousetraps, there are a hundred
successes founded on selling mouse
traps as rat-traps, flower-pots, and
soup-strainers. The art is only cas
ually a business practice. The science
of deception flowers into lull bloom
in the realm of government.

real reform —and are given shoddy.

people. Politicians flatter the popu
lace into believing it is the cream
and the flower of the land. The re
sult is not only vanity, but smuij
vanity—a most delightful combina
i tion.
So what? Vanity being what it is,
and people being what they are,
people may be just as easily duped
into voting and thinking right as
j wrong. A group of San Francisco

daily—have recently endorsed un
employment insurance. Vanity, like
rubber bands, may be pulled in both
•directions. There is nothing wrong
with vanity; it has just been mis
used. Vanity is a good thing.
