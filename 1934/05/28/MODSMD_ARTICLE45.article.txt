EXASPERATING
"It would be quicker to read about
it in the Sunday newspapers,"
chanted Farm folk Friday and Sat
urday, as they struggled through
two hours, listening to a radio ac
count of the I.C.A.A.A.A. track meet
which, although entertining, was far
from informative.
And each member of that "vast
unseen audience" undoubtedly has
his own idea to how a track meet
; should be announced. In the first
place, it was nice to hear at five
minute intervals, a resume of win
ners of events to date. But it grad
ually became exasperating when
these resumes interrupted a per
fectly good summary of some cru
cial event where a second, third, or
fourth, might have decided the meet.
STANFORD WON,
SAY THE PAPERS
Imagine the surprise of eager cam
pus fans when, approximately 10
minutes after the 200-meter finais
were over, the announcer calmly
informed listeners that A1 Blackmail
(i hud placed third. No mention had
been made prior to the running of
the event that Blackmail had even
qualified for the finals. And those
three points of Blackmail's were the
ones that cinched the meet.
At one time during the contest,
the loud speaker blurted forth the
tidings that Stanford had amassed
27 points. At that time, the shot,
javelin, and 400 had been announced,
which totaled 18 digits for the Red
skins. Some 30 minutes later, it was
reported for the first time that early
in the afternoon Slinger Dunn and
John Lyman had scored one-two in
the discus, which was one of the
bigger surprises of the entire day.
KLOPSTOCK GIVEN
DIFFICULT JOB
Sammy Klopstock's mild fall in the
high hurdle semi-finals may be ac
credited to one of two things—wet
track or over-anxiety. It was prob
ably a mixture of both. Entering his
first national meet, the flashy sopho
more was given a task thiit would
be almost too much for the average
veteran. He was asked to win 101
points in the most perilous and un- :
certain events on the track program.
So it was easy to understand Klop
stock's position as he a muddy
hurdle semi-finals, determined he
should place. That fall, in all prob
ability, would have been prevented
if Captain Gus Meier had been on j
hand to run in those barrier races.
With both Klopstock and Meier com
peting, neither would have had such
a load on his shoulders, and both
probably would have calmly settled
down to the tedious work of qualify
ing in both events. Eighteen Stan
ford points in the two races would
have been probable under these con
ditions.
When the seven Cards arrive on !
ihe Farm Wednesday they will set
tle down to preparations for tho j
N.C.A.A. in Los Angeles next month.
This meet will bring together most
of the standouts at Philadelphia, be
sides many other national track and
field shining lights. Stanford's show
ing in this meet may prove the con
tention that the 1.C.4-A. is not truly
representative. It is reasonably safe
to say that the Indians, in spite of
the fact that the original seven j

probably will be re-inforced, will
not succeed in gathering 35 points at
Los Angeles as they did in Philadel
phia. —Browne

cial event where a second, third, or
fourth, might have decided the meet.
STANFORD WON,
SAY THE PAPERS
Imagine the surprise of eager cam
pus fans when, approximately 10
minutes after the 200-meter finais
were over, the announcer calmly
informed listeners that A1 Blackmail
(i hud placed third. No mention had
been made prior to the running of
the event that Blackmail had even
qualified for the finals. And those
three points of Blackmail's were the
ones that cinched the meet.
At one time during the contest,
the loud speaker blurted forth the
tidings that Stanford had amassed
27 points. At that time, the shot,
javelin, and 400 had been announced,
which totaled 18 digits for the Red
skins. Some 30 minutes later, it was
reported for the first time that early
in the afternoon Slinger Dunn and
John Lyman had scored one-two in
the discus, which was one of the
bigger surprises of the entire day.
KLOPSTOCK GIVEN
DIFFICULT JOB
Sammy Klopstock's mild fall in the
high hurdle semi-finals may be ac
credited to one of two things—wet
track or over-anxiety. It was prob
ably a mixture of both. Entering his
first national meet, the flashy sopho
more was given a task thiit would
be almost too much for the average
veteran. He was asked to win 101
points in the most perilous and un- :
certain events on the track program.
So it was easy to understand Klop
stock's position as he a muddy
hurdle semi-finals, determined he
should place. That fall, in all prob
ability, would have been prevented
if Captain Gus Meier had been on j
hand to run in those barrier races.
With both Klopstock and Meier com
peting, neither would have had such
a load on his shoulders, and both
probably would have calmly settled
down to the tedious work of qualify
ing in both events. Eighteen Stan
ford points in the two races would
have been probable under these con
ditions.
When the seven Cards arrive on !
ihe Farm Wednesday they will set
tle down to preparations for tho j
N.C.A.A. in Los Angeles next month.
This meet will bring together most
of the standouts at Philadelphia, be
sides many other national track and
field shining lights. Stanford's show
ing in this meet may prove the con
tention that the 1.C.4-A. is not truly
representative. It is reasonably safe
to say that the Indians, in spite of
the fact that the original seven j

probably will be re-inforced, will
not succeed in gathering 35 points at
Los Angeles as they did in Philadel
phia. —Browne
RADIO ACCOUNT
EXASPERATING
"It would be quicker to read about
it in the Sunday newspapers,"
chanted Farm folk Friday and Sat
urday, as they struggled through
two hours, listening to a radio ac
count of the I.C.A.A.A.A. track meet
which, although entertining, was far
from informative.
And each member of that "vast
unseen audience" undoubtedly has
his own idea to how a track meet
; should be announced. In the first
place, it was nice to hear at five
minute intervals, a resume of win
ners of events to date. But it grad
ually became exasperating when
these resumes interrupted a per
fectly good summary of some cru
cial event where a second, third, or
