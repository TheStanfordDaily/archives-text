Track System Copied
This system, similar to that used 1
in scoring the Olympic Games de- i
cathlon, was worked out so that a
man who scores high in the most
difficult events such as tho» soccer j
kick or the fence climb will get more i
credit than the man who scores high
in an easier event such as the 50-
yard dash or baseball throw.
The organization championship '
will be awarded basis of place j
points similar to the scoring of a !
track meet. There will be 15 plac#

being scored for first place, 14 for j
second, etc., and The Stanford Daily i
organization trophy will go to the
group scoring the highest number of I
place points.

varsity football practice field, Stan
ford's first annual All-Sports De
cathlon gets under way promptly at
4 o'clock this afternoon with a field
of 57 entries.

football sled, following that order.
The only rules as to apparel and
equipment are that contestants must
wear rubber-soled canvas shoes
(tennis or basketball shoes) or be

Difficult to Count
The baseball throw and football
punt will be made from a 12-foot

In the former event, the longest of
three throws will be taken as the
competitor's record, but in the punt
ing, the three kicks will be averaged.
Scoring for the individual cham
pionship will be on the basis of 100
points as the best possible score in
each event. The 10 events havg been
rated as to difficulty with the aid of
the Stanford coaches and have been j
given rating numbers ranging from
1.2 to .7. The score made by an i
athlete in an event will be multi- 1
plied by its rating number to deter- ;
mine his point total in that event.
