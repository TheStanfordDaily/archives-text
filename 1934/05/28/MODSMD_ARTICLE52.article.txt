## Finals of Military Events Friday Afternoon 
### 
With drawings for horses to be

the military stables office, last op
portunity will be offered for those
R.O.T.C. interested to enter
the 15th Annual Military Horse
Show, the finals of which will take
place Friday afternoon, June 1.
Chairman Bill Enemark of the
Scabbard and Blade arrangements
committee urges as many men as
possible to come around this after
noon and try out for the show, which
promises to be one of the finest in
the long series of hoi*se shows that
has been sponsored here by the hon
orary military society and the mili
tary department.
Six Events Offered
The six events offer a wide field
of choice to entrants. Everyone has
an equal chance to draw first choice
of the horses, Enemark pointed out.
Suitable awards will also be do
nated, he hinted, although arrange
ments in this respect are not yet ;
complete.
The events of the show are divided j
into two classes, one for basic stu- I
dents and the other for advanced j
course men, Captain R. A. Gordan j
explained. The events to be shown j
will consist of horsemanship, jump- |
ing, potato race, and musical chairs. I
The horsemanship classes will show
the horses at walk, trot, and gallop- j
around-the-ring, with performance j
of the rider in regard to his seat, use
of the aids, and the handling of his
mount, counting.
The jumping classes will be elimi
nations with the jumps starting at
three feet, each contestant to go
twice around the four-jump course.
As men are eliminated the jumps
will be elevated, it was explained.
Potato Race
In the potato race, piles of pota
toes are placed at eight-yard inter- i
vals about 30 yards to the front of
the starting line. At tue gun the {
mounted contestants gallop out to 1
the potatoes and, picking one up on
the end of a long stick, carry it back
and deposit it in a bucket.
In the musical chairs the contest
ants ride around bareback outside I
of a marked circle in which are ,
placed a number of chairs two less ;
than the number of riders. When j
the music stops the contestants, who j
must ride at a fast pace, vault off j
their mounts and grab a chair. Those '
not reaching a chair are eliminated ,
and the process is repeated, with 1
the number of chairs each time de- i
pleted so that there are always fewer
seats than riders. The winner is thus ;
determined by elimination.

A preliminary survey indicates }
that acreage planted with water
melons in the southern part of Geor
gia will be increased 30 to 40 per
cent this season. '

the horses at walk, trot, and gallop- j
around-the-ring, with performance j
of the rider in regard to his seat, use
of the aids, and the handling of his
mount, counting.
The jumping classes will be elimi
nations with the jumps starting at
three feet, each contestant to go
twice around the four-jump course.
As men are eliminated the jumps
will be elevated, it was explained.
Potato Race
In the potato race, piles of pota
toes are placed at eight-yard inter- i
vals about 30 yards to the front of
the starting line. At tue gun the {
mounted contestants gallop out to 1
the potatoes and, picking one up on
the end of a long stick, carry it back
and deposit it in a bucket.
In the musical chairs the contest
ants ride around bareback outside I
of a marked circle in which are ,
placed a number of chairs two less ;
than the number of riders. When j
the music stops the contestants, who j
must ride at a fast pace, vault off j
their mounts and grab a chair. Those '
not reaching a chair are eliminated ,
and the process is repeated, with 1
the number of chairs each time de- i
pleted so that there are always fewer
seats than riders. The winner is thus ;
determined by elimination.

A preliminary survey indicates }
that acreage planted with water
melons in the southern part of Geor
gia will be increased 30 to 40 per
cent this season. '
