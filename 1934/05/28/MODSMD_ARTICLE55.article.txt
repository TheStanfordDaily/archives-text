# RAIN-DELAYED MIXED DOUBLES, CLASS TENNIS TOURNEY MATCHES PLAYED TODAY
## 
### 
If the weather permits, five re- ;
maining first-round matches in the |
mixed doubles tennis tournament
must be played this afternoon. In
any case, these clashes must be set- |
tied as soon as possible, since the
entire tourney is to run only one
more week. 'All second - round i
matches should be completed today
or tomorrow, also.
Handicaps Used
The five matches to be played are
as follows: liannah-Ransom vs. |
Shelton-TayLor; Kesting-Shwayder!
vs. Buckwalter - Partner; Swanord-
Bogan vs. Richter-Gray; Wakefield-
Goldstein vs. Pearce-Seward; and
Kay Johnston vs. Gruenberg-part- i
ner.
Among these 10, the teams com
posed of Kesting-Shwayder and j
Pearce-Seward are rated along with
the pairs of Alice Philp-Ben Dey, ;

Margaret Diedrich-Chuck Otis, and
Dorothy Anne Jackson-Glenn Reed
as the tournament favorites. The
heavy handicaps imposed on the
stronger teams make the outcome
doubtful, however.
Frosh vs. Grads
The week-end rains also delayed
the interclass net tourney. The frosh
and grads are to meet today, with
the yearlings given the edge because
of their fine showing in defeating,
the seniors. Ben Dey is favored over
Johnny Cassel for a probable frosh
victory in the first singles match,
but Glenn Reed of the grads should
even the count against Bob Pom
mer of the Class of '37.
As the second and third doubles
are uncertain, the chances are that
the first doubles will settle thLs key
match. Dey and Pommer will face
Cassel and Reed in a toss-up match.
