# TRAINED LEADERS ARE NEEDED, SAYS A.A.U.W. CONCLAVE
## Discussion Introduced By President Wilbur 
### 
Trained leadership, its necessity in
the present day, and the problems
encountered in finding it, was the
predominant subject of discussion
and dissertation at the annual con
clave of the California branch of the
American Association of University
Women, held on the campus Friday
and Saturday. The question which
precipitated the parley was posed by
President Ray Lyman Wilbur when
he spoke at the education dinner
Friday evening.
"Why are geese smarter than hu
man beings when it comes to choos
ing leaders?" Dr. Wilbur queried,
and, defining a good leader as one
"who can foresee what will happen
and prepares us for it," he illus
trated his point by showing how
quail know how to select a chief to
stand on guard, perceive signs uner
ringly, and warn others irf timeâ€”a
chief "who never sells out to the
howks."
It was Dr. Wilbur's opinion that
the chances for leadership are better
in a university-trained group than
elsewhere, and that universities of
today are increasingly attentive to
some of the problems of leadership,
particularly in the field of business.
Professors Ralph Lutz, Graham
Stuart, and Peter Odegard addressed
the guests at the international re
lations dinner, Saturday night, on
the phases of public opinion and
peace.
