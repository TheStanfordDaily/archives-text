# THREE TRUSTEES CHOSEN ON S.F. FAIR COMMITTEE
## 
### 
Three members of tl*j Stanford
Board of Trustees have been ap
pointed to a Boai'd of Directors of a
World's Fair to be held in San Fran
cisco as a commemoration of the
completion of the bay bridges under
construction, and plans for the affair
are now being formulated.
In charge of organization is Leland
W. Cutler, who is also president of
the Board of Trustees. Long a leader
in civic life, and a former head of
the San Francisco Chamber of Com
merce, Cutler championed the fight
for the San Francisco-Oakland
bridge.

The other two trustees appointed
to the committee are W. Palmer Ful
ler and Judge M. C. Sloss.
Yerba Island Shoals, situated mid
way between San Francisco and
Oakland, have been selected as a
tentative site for the Fair, subject
to approval by the committee and
Navy Department officials.
The shoals, now under water, can
be filled in at no more expense than
would be incurred in the prepara
tion of other sites, and could then be
used as a location for a long-needed
airport. Favorable weather condi
tions further recommend the site.
