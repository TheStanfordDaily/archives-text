# COAST CONFERENCE MEETS IN PORTLAND TO DISCUSS SCHEDULES, RUGBY, TENNIS
## 
### 
Three Stanford representatives are |
attending the meeting of the Pacific
Coast Conference held at Portland
today and tomorrow for the purpose
of drawing up a tentative football
schedule for the 1935 season.
The delegation from Stanford in
cludes Football Coach Claude E.
"Tiny" Thornhill, Graduate Manager
Alfred E. Masters, and Faculty Rep- j
resentative Professor W. B. Owens.
In formulating the new schedule, '
it is probable that each team will
play six conference games during
the season instead of the unequal
number of games now being played.
This will simplify conference foot- ,

ball standings.
There may also be a move to elim
inate juggling of the rankings for
tennis players. By doing away with
realignment before matches, the
players will meet men who are of
the same calibre as themselves.
Another possible innovation is the
recognition of rugby by the confer
ence, and arranging for regular
games among the teams of U.C.L.A.,
U.S.C., California, and Stanford. If
this goes through, the schedule will
probably be in the "home and home"
plan, which calls for a game apiece
on the campuses of the two teams
concerned.
