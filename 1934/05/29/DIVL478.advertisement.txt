FOR YOUR TYPEWRITER
Don't take the chance of doing injury to your typewriter by parking
it this summer someplace where the dust and dirt can get at it.
Bring it to the Bookstore before going home and we'll take perfect
care of it for you, throughout the summer, without charge.
AND .... if any adjusting, cleaning, oiling or repairing is needed
you can count on us to do it as it should be done, and there's no
fear of being overcharged.
REGARDLESS of where you are going this summer, if taking your
typewriter with you, let us service it before you leave.
