# FACTIONS LIST CONTENTIONS IN LETTER DISPUTE
## Fullenwider Presents Petition for Student Vote to Ex Committee Tonight, in Final Business Meeting of Year 
### 
To clarify the issues in the present minor sports controversy concerning
the awarding of a Block to third-year winners of a Circle "S," the
Daily is continuing to print hoth sides of the argument, so that students may
understand the principles involved.
Tonight in Ex Committee Frank Fullenwider, constitution revision com
mitteeman who wrote the disputed athletic by-law which the Ex Committee

passed last Tuesday, will present a
petition of 150 signatures for a cam
pus vote on the subject. A date for
the election will probably be set to
night.
Complete Business
Among other things that the Ex
Committee will have to consider to
night in their last business meeting
of the year are: the proposed charter
for the Rally Committee (held over
from last Tuesday); all remaining
by-laws of the old Constitution; and
the contested appointment of Bob
Herman as Daily business manager.
Arguments pro and con have been
written by representatives of the
contending groups, who decided that
the issues were as follows, with rea
sons for the award listed first:
1. The award should be based on
the record of the athlete, not the
sport he is competing in. A good
athlete in every sport should be able
to work toward a block "S," and the
letter should stand for what the in
dividual has done, not the gate re
ceipts of his sport.
Charge Favorism
Why should a man be forced to
win a national championship in one
sport, yet place against California in
another to win the same atvard?
The three-year clause, the coaches'
promise of no more "gift" awards,
and the tightening of the require
ments for letters in all sports, assure
us that only outstanding athletes will
win blocks, and that the total num
ber of blocks will not be greater than
heretofore.
Enters for Competition
2. The '"backbone" type of ath
lete is interested primarily in com
petition and love of the sport; but is
it fair to brand him with a. Circle
"S" because fewer people see him
perform? Certainly three years ot
competition should equalize the dif
ferences that are claimed to exist be
tween the extremes in sport.
Contentions of the opposition
forces who wish to retain the status
quo and are against awarding of
Block "S's" to third-year winners of
the circle letter, are as follows:
Oppose Change
The present proposed amendment
will not serve to put sports on the
basis of athletic prowess solely. It
too allows those who just manage
to get under the wire for three years
in some sport as gym or fencing to
get a block regardless of outstanding
ability.
No one denies a block to those of
the caliber of Lawson Little, but
unfortunately several three-year
minors are not in his class. If it is
qbjected that some of the present
major sports get their blocks too
easily, less letters should be awarded.
The bacKbone of any team is the
athlete who has been in the sport
for many years and who is of the
type that goes out for the sport for
the fun and companionship that he
gets out of it and not solely for the
award that it gives. If a man is the
type that any decent sport can use
he will {Jo into it regardless of the
award. So the argument that giving
Circle "S" men a block to aim for
will increase the turnout fails when
the real reason why an athlete be
comes proficient is considered.
