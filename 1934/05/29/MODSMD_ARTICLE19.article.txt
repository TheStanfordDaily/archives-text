# Strikers Riot, Battle Police
## Authorities Use Shotguns, Tear Gas on Mob 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 28 (&).â€”
Fierce rioting broke out on the wa
terfront here and at San Diego late
today, sending eight men to hospi
tals and resulting in less severe in
juries to scores of participants, as
shippers and striking longshoremen
were reported to have reached a
deadlock in negotiations to settle the
longshoremen's strike.
Tear gas bombs were hurled by
police and shotguns were fired into
the air as officers sought to halt the
fury of a mob estimated at between
1,000 and 2,000 men, who surged
along the Embarcadero here. Re
ports said machine guns had been
set up along the waterfront here
but Chief of Police William J. Quinn
refused to say what weapons had
been placed at the disposal of 500
policemen sent to the embattled dis
trict.
Compromise Rejected
The disturbance here was re
ported to have followed word that
the International Longshoremen's
Association had rejected a compro
mise proposal of shipping men be
fore Federal mediators in another
of the many moves made toward
settlement of the coastwide walk
out now involving more than 25,000
men.
A group of men gathered at a va
cant lot near the strikers' headquar
ters and a speaker harangued them,
urging them "to show the shippers
that we mean business."
Mounted policemen hurried to the
scene and endeavored to scatter the
men. One man assertedly hurled a
rock and the battle was on.
OlTiccr Attacked
A mounted officer, attempting to
ride back the men from the side
walk, was jerked from his horse and
attacked by several men. Immedi
ately other officers came to his aid
and a wild melee ensued. Other
mounted patrolmen were hauled
from their horses and a call brought
more than 500 policemen to the
scene in patrol cars.
The milling mob grabbed bricks,
sticks, and other missiles and hurled
them at the officers. Police wielded
their clubs and many of the rioters
fell.
Rioters Driven Back
Driven back by the increasing
numbers of patrolmen, the mob
quieted momentarily as ambulances
entered the district and removed the
injured men to hospitals.
Hurriedly rallying, the mob again
bore down on the officers, knocking
down the blue-coated men and
beating them severely before fellow
officers tcould come to their rescue.
