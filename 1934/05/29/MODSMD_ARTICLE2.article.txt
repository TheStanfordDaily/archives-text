# Chapel Covered Volumes Display Novel Features
## 
### 
With a natural color repro
duction of the facade of the
Chapel on the cover to start
things off right, the Quad comes
out today with many novel and
some very lovely innovations.
The picture of the Chapel is by
no means the only outstanding
feature of the latest record of
the events of the Stanford year.
One of the most unusual and
attractive of the new ideas of
the Quad staff is the introduc
tion of infra-red photographs.
The pictures, taken in broad
daylight, look as though they
have been taken at night, and
give many new angles to fami
liar campus sights.
As to arrangement, one of the
newer things is the lining up of
the senior pictures in three
horizontal lines instead of the
two vertical rows. Sorority and
fraternity members arc grouped
in classes. All in all it promises
to he one of the more unusual
of the Quads and one of the
most complete.
