# Quads Ready, Will Be Issued This Afternoon
## 1700 Copies of '34 Volume Edited by Sadler 
### 
Seventeen hundred copies of the
1934 Quad, edited by A1 Sadler, will
appear on the Stanford campus at
1:30 o'clock this afternoon as dis
tribution of the yearbook begins in
the A.S.S.U. offices in the Old Union.
Judged by the few who have seen
it as one of the best Quads pro
duced, it is almost sold out, says
Business Manager Hal Whitfield.
There are fewer than 100 copies re
maining for sale, and considering
that nearly that number have been
sold in the past fevfc days, this does
not represent a large margin.
Receipt Essential
Since distribution will be by num
ber rather than alphabetically, a re
ceipt is absolutely necessary to ob
tain a book. To avoid delay and
confusion second installments should
be paid this morning. Quad repre
sentatives will be in front of the post
office from 8-12 o'clock to attend to
this.

Whitfield also advises that all other
difficulties be cleared up ahead of
time. The few remaining copies of
the Quad may be ordered for $5 65
apiece. Since a sellout is expected,
it is advised that this be done ao
soon as possible in order to avoid
possible last-minute disappointment.
Signatures Required
In order to keep a close check on
the Quads given out, the Quad offi
cials have decided to require the
signature of each purchaser on his
receipt. In case that the purchaser
is not getting the book in person,
both his name and the name of the
person receiving the book will be
necessary.
Since the distribution will con
tinue from 1:30 to 5 o'clock, Whitfield
asks that not everyone come at the
earliest hour since there is bound to
be a great deal of pushing, jostling,
and rushing, which may in that way
be avoided.
