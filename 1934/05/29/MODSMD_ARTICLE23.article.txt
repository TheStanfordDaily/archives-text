# Senior Dues Collected In Last Week of Drive
## 
### 
Bob Savage and his senior class
finance committee are making a final
drive this week to collect class dues.
The dues, set at $1.50 this year, will
go to pay the class expenses during
the next month's activities, Savage
said. Most of the money collected
will be used during Senior Week,
and will pay for the class plate, class
gift, and permanent senior class
fund.
Dues cards will be required before
class members may purchase bids to
the Senior Ball, Savage said, and
they will entitle the owner to a free
bid to the Prom, a ticket to the
alumni dinner, the privilege of sign
ing the class roll, and will take care
of expenses on the class picnic.
