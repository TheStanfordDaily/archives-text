# Sedate Seniors Forget Dignity; Skate With Glee
## 
### 
Whooping it up with the best of
five-year-old vim and vigor, nigh on
to 100 erst-while sedate seniors
glided around the Quad to the light
of the full moon last night.
With waving arms and shrieks of
dismay the feminine contingent re
tained their equilibrium with diffi
culty, while Sir Galahads did their
best to be gallant under the unsteady
circumstances. Professionals were
in evidence, however, or those who
had been secretly practicing to skate
into prominence when several of the
roughs were observed to skate back
wards effortlessly, or to maneuver
a difficult figure eight.
The main attraction of the evening
was not, however, the display of
muscular co-ordination, but the ice
cream. Crowds gathered around the
Chapel to munch ice cream while
resting themselves from their unac
customed exercise.
Casualties were of a minor nature,
such as a few skinned knees and
innumerable tottering egos. "Sun
shine" McClure was observed to take
the geology corner on two wheels,
but a catastrophe was averted by the
narrowest margin.
A full moon showed up many a
blushing victim of sport.
