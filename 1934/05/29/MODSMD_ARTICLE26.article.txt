# A 						VICTIM OF BLIND GOVERNMENT
## EDITORIAL 
### 
By its railroading tactics on the night of May 7 (the
occasion may he remembered because it caused a blank
editorial column to appear in this paper on the following
morning), the Executive Committee has committed an
atrocity even larger than was at first supposed.
The outcome of that narrow-minded, ill-advised, hypo
critical decision can he best illustrated by tin; headlines
and story to the top and right of this editorial. An inno
cent man has been made the victim of a group which,
according to its own leader's words, acted in spile, lie
cause it felt that an editorial which had appeared previous
to the meeting had not contained the reflection of right
eousness toward the Executive Committee, the group de
cided that it would bite back. It did, and its fangs have
sunk deep. As a result, Stanley Beaubaire, a person whose
personal record on this campus has been clean, Inis been
crucified. He was named editor by his fellow members of
the staff in an election which, as far as Beaubaire was
concerned, had no taint. The losers then took advantage
of the Executive Committee's dumbness and stepped in,
drawing up charges in the Men's Council against Beaubaire
which accused him of dirty politics. He denied the accu
sations, but because three friends of the losers gave testi
mony about conversations with Beaubaire which only he
could refute, the council decided that the predominance
of witnesses should make the man guilty—the victim of
blind government.
The Executive Committee was toid in that May 7 meet
ing that to continue elections on the Daily would be only
to continue making this newspaper, an organization which
is supposed to be interested primarily in the gathering and
conveying of news to the campus, a political football. But
because the committee had had its toes stepped on (in
reality the pressure was very light) it threw discretion and
common sense to the winds with the idea of "getting even."
Today, an innocent person has been unjustly nailed to the
cross. Those nails should be pulled out and his wounds
treated immediately by the Administration, where the final
say of student government lies.
The Daily does not believe that the council's decision
was based on every element of the case, but it cannot deny
the conscientiousness with which the members have la
bored during the past week. They have been honest, but
they, too, have been victimized by a blundering Executive
Committee.
if these difficulties ever are to be cleared up, it is evi
dent that the Administration must step in and lend sup
port. Student government is on the spot. If it is to continue
without the serious bunglings of recent months, it should
have the assistance which can be offered only by older,
more experienced people. The Daily and the campus are
awaiting the decision of Dr. Wilbur relative to the Men's
Council recommendation.

more experienced people. The Daily and the campus are
awaiting the decision of Dr. Wilbur relative to the Men's
Council recommendation.
By its railroading tactics on the night of May 7 (the
occasion may he remembered because it caused a blank
editorial column to appear in this paper on the following
morning), the Executive Committee has committed an
atrocity even larger than was at first supposed.
The outcome of that narrow-minded, ill-advised, hypo
critical decision can he best illustrated by tin; headlines
and story to the top and right of this editorial. An inno
cent man has been made the victim of a group which,
according to its own leader's words, acted in spile, lie
cause it felt that an editorial which had appeared previous
to the meeting had not contained the reflection of right
eousness toward the Executive Committee, the group de
cided that it would bite back. It did, and its fangs have
sunk deep. As a result, Stanley Beaubaire, a person whose
personal record on this campus has been clean, Inis been
crucified. He was named editor by his fellow members of
the staff in an election which, as far as Beaubaire was
concerned, had no taint. The losers then took advantage
of the Executive Committee's dumbness and stepped in,
drawing up charges in the Men's Council against Beaubaire
which accused him of dirty politics. He denied the accu
sations, but because three friends of the losers gave testi
mony about conversations with Beaubaire which only he
could refute, the council decided that the predominance
of witnesses should make the man guilty—the victim of
blind government.
The Executive Committee was toid in that May 7 meet
ing that to continue elections on the Daily would be only
to continue making this newspaper, an organization which
is supposed to be interested primarily in the gathering and
conveying of news to the campus, a political football. But
because the committee had had its toes stepped on (in
reality the pressure was very light) it threw discretion and
common sense to the winds with the idea of "getting even."
Today, an innocent person has been unjustly nailed to the
cross. Those nails should be pulled out and his wounds
treated immediately by the Administration, where the final
say of student government lies.
The Daily does not believe that the council's decision
was based on every element of the case, but it cannot deny
the conscientiousness with which the members have la
bored during the past week. They have been honest, but
they, too, have been victimized by a blundering Executive
Committee.
if these difficulties ever are to be cleared up, it is evi
dent that the Administration must step in and lend sup
port. Student government is on the spot. If it is to continue
without the serious bunglings of recent months, it should
have the assistance which can be offered only by older,
more experienced people. The Daily and the campus are
awaiting the decision of Dr. Wilbur relative to the Men's
Council recommendation.
