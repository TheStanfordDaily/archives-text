# Council Says Election Void
## 
### 
Having been asked to investigate
charges of unfair and subversive
politics in the recent Daily editorial
election, the Men's Council, after
due deliberation, makes the follow
ing recommendations, subject to ap
proval of Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur:
First: That the entire editorial
election of May 16, 1934, be declared
null and void, and that the three
candidates participating therein be
declared ineligible for the editorship
of Volume 86. These candidates,
however, shall be eligible for the
editorship of Volume 87, and shall
remain on the staff as free-lance
feature writers. These men shall not
be members of the editorial board of
Volume 86.
Second: The Daily staff shall con
duct a complete new editorial elec
tion for Volume 86 as soon as pos
sible.
Third: In the event that the Daily
staff cannot satisfactorialy agree
upon an editor for Volume 86, t.he
Executive Committee shall appoint
an editor for this volume.
Fourth: That a committee shall be
appointed by the Executive Com
mittee to investigate the Daily 'edi
torial election system; to suggest a
new plan for said elections, which
will be more practical and less con
ducive to unfair methods; and to
clearly definite, and establish the
meaning of the term "subversive and
unfair politics."
