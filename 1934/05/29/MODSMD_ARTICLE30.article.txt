# NEW ELECTION FOR EDITOR SUGGESTED BY MEN'S COUNCIL
## Two Defeated Candidates, Graves and Guerard, Bring Charges BEAUBAIRE DENIES Recommendation Affects All Three Men 
### Bob Letts 
Concluding deliberations which
have lasted for more than a week,
the Men's Council last night recom
mended to Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur
that The Stanford Daily election of
May 16, when Stanley Beaubaire
was named as head of Volume 86
(from October to February) be de
clared null and void and that a new
election be called as soon as possible.
The decision was the outcome of
charges made by the two losing can
didates, Albert Guerard, Jr., and Jay
Graves, whom Beaubaire defeated by
a clear majority, and was based on
the losers' assertions that their op
ponent had participated in "unfair
and subversive politics." It was the
third successive election mess on the
Daily in which Graves had been an
active participant.
Declared Ineligible
Unable to take a definite stand on,
the charges, the Council arrived at
the conclusion that not only Beau
baire, but Graves and Guerard as
well, should be declared ineligible
for the recommended re-election for
ihe editor of next fall's volume. The
trio, according to the verdict, will be
allowed to remain on the staff, but
will not be members of the editorial
board nor of the regular production
staff, being classed as "free-lance
feature writers," whatever they are.
Recommend Election
The Council's second recommen
dation to Dr. Wilbur is that the Daily
staff shall conduct a complete new
editorial election for Volume 86 as
soon as possible. Thirdly, it is sug
gested that "in the event that the
Daily staff cannot satisfactorily agree
upon an editor for Volume 86, the
Executive Committee shall appoint
an editor for this volume." In other
words, the football is to be kicked
from the Ex Committee to Men's
Council and back to Ex Committee.
As its fourth and final point, the
body makes its outstanding recom
mendation, that the election system
for the Daily be investigated by a
committee and that a new plan be
suggested. However, the Publica
tions Council attempted to do this
early in the present quarter, but ef
forts of that body were shoved into
the waste basket by the Executive
Committee on May 7 when the pres
ent setup was railroaded through
with the aid of some of the most
high-handed politics ever seen on
this campus.
Paper Lacks Editor
As a result of the ruling, the Daily
today draws to within three days of
its close, and it has no editor for next
fall. What the outcome will be is
partially up to Dr. Wilbur, who has
yet to approve the Council decision.
Mentioned as possible candidates
for the job arc the two associate
editors-elect, Charles Chappell and
Francis (Spud) Hamilton, but one of
these men already has declared his
belief that the new editor should not
have to assume control of the staff
which would still contain the three
ineligible candidates. The other has
doubted the feasibility of being
forced to head an organization which
"still would be for Beaubaire."
Promises Decision
Dr. Wilbur said yesterday thai he
would announce his decision some
time today. As a retiring editor who
has seen Daily elections become the
laughing stock of the campus, my
hope is that, he will let the May 16
I election stand, place Beaubaire on
probation, responsible directly to the
1 President, and order a setup which
will place the Daily on an entirely
independent basis so that it will be
J free from outside interferences
i which "have caused the majority of
the trouble in the last year and a
half. We've tried, but have been
! stymied by the Executive Commit-
I tee, which doesn't know anything
j about its newspaper but still insists
: on trying to dictate to it.

Committee on May 7 when the pres
ent setup was railroaded through
with the aid of some of the most
high-handed politics ever seen on
this campus.
Paper Lacks Editor
As a result of the ruling, the Daily
today draws to within three days of
its close, and it has no editor for next
fall. What the outcome will be is
partially up to Dr. Wilbur, who has
yet to approve the Council decision.
Mentioned as possible candidates
for the job arc the two associate
editors-elect, Charles Chappell and
Francis (Spud) Hamilton, but one of
these men already has declared his
belief that the new editor should not
have to assume control of the staff
which would still contain the three
ineligible candidates. The other has
doubted the feasibility of being
forced to head an organization which
"still would be for Beaubaire."
Promises Decision
Dr. Wilbur said yesterday thai he
would announce his decision some
time today. As a retiring editor who
has seen Daily elections become the
laughing stock of the campus, my
hope is that, he will let the May 16
I election stand, place Beaubaire on
probation, responsible directly to the
1 President, and order a setup which
will place the Daily on an entirely
independent basis so that it will be
J free from outside interferences
i which "have caused the majority of
the trouble in the last year and a
half. We've tried, but have been
! stymied by the Executive Commit-
I tee, which doesn't know anything
j about its newspaper but still insists
: on trying to dictate to it.
Concluding deliberations which
have lasted for more than a week,
the Men's Council last night recom
mended to Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur
that The Stanford Daily election of
May 16, when Stanley Beaubaire
was named as head of Volume 86
(from October to February) be de
clared null and void and that a new
election be called as soon as possible.
The decision was the outcome of
charges made by the two losing can
didates, Albert Guerard, Jr., and Jay
Graves, whom Beaubaire defeated by
a clear majority, and was based on
the losers' assertions that their op
ponent had participated in "unfair
and subversive politics." It was the
third successive election mess on the
Daily in which Graves had been an
active participant.
Declared Ineligible
Unable to take a definite stand on,
the charges, the Council arrived at
the conclusion that not only Beau
baire, but Graves and Guerard as
well, should be declared ineligible
for the recommended re-election for
ihe editor of next fall's volume. The
trio, according to the verdict, will be
allowed to remain on the staff, but
will not be members of the editorial
board nor of the regular production
staff, being classed as "free-lance
feature writers," whatever they are.
Recommend Election
The Council's second recommen
dation to Dr. Wilbur is that the Daily
staff shall conduct a complete new
editorial election for Volume 86 as
soon as possible. Thirdly, it is sug
gested that "in the event that the
Daily staff cannot satisfactorily agree
upon an editor for Volume 86, the
Executive Committee shall appoint
an editor for this volume." In other
words, the football is to be kicked
from the Ex Committee to Men's
Council and back to Ex Committee.
As its fourth and final point, the
body makes its outstanding recom
mendation, that the election system
for the Daily be investigated by a
committee and that a new plan be
suggested. However, the Publica
tions Council attempted to do this
early in the present quarter, but ef
forts of that body were shoved into
the waste basket by the Executive
Committee on May 7 when the pres
ent setup was railroaded through
with the aid of some of the most
high-handed politics ever seen on
