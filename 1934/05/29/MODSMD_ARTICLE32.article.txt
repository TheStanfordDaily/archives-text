# Tomorrow May Never Come
## 
### 
If Hit' Executive Committee doesn't remove ilselt' from
the gluepot promptly tonight, it will very probably find
itself entering finals week without having attended to some
very important matters. Some things can be postponed
from day to day, from week to week, and nobody will
bother to raise mucli of a howl. Hut when matters of cam
pus-wide importance are postponed for tomorrow and to
morrow, it becomes a very different situation.
Proposition number one is the question of a new the
atre for Stanford. The Daily has consistently and ener
getically maintained its efforts to bring a worthy home of
the drama to the campus. Ex Committee thus far lias good
naturedly patted the idea on the back and let it go at that,
liking the plan but not being too confident of the result.
One can't get something one does not try for. And one
stands a very good chance of getting something after con
centration of effort. Several individuals have tried very
hard to bring definite action on the theatre question, which
Stanford has a good chance of solving very soon. Tonight
w ill be a good time to get some progress on this matter.
Another matter is that of the proposed Rally Com
mittee charter. Today that group is operating under an
obsolete, unwieldy document that does not adequately care
for the function of the Rally Committee as experienced
during the past year. Last week, Ex Committee was sup
posed to have considered the new charter as drawn up
by the Constitution Revision Committee. Rccause two or
three members were too tired, tliev didn't get that far. The
Rally Committee today is facing the situation of planning
for the coming scholastic year and its many problems with
out having an adequate organization to care for the new
si tuation.
If the Rally Committee is to continue in the role of
guardian angel to campus dances, ticket sales drives, etc.,
in addition to regular rooting section work, immediate ac
tion is needed to provide proper machinery for the scheme.
Tonight is the time for that action to be taken.
