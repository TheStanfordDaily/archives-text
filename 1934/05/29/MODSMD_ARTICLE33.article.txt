# WHY IT'S NEWS
## More Than One Man Can Handle 
### CROMPTON BANGS Jr 
TRYING TO SEND
CONGRESS HOME
The President wants to get Con
gress off his hands early in June, or
sooner if possible. Most Congress
men want to get home to start their
summer and fall re-election cam
paigns. But there is so much to do
in such a short time that many of
ihe White House-sponsored bills
will have to be thrown overboard in
the shuffle.
Even if some of his pet bills have
to be junked. F.R. wants to got Con
gress out of Washington—for two
reasons. The first is that he is tired
and needs a rest; the second is that
he thinks the country wants less un
certainty about the future. It is an
old American custom for business to
have the jitters whenever Congress
is in session; the longer the session,
the worse the jitters.
IJUT THERE IS THE
JOB OF DELEGATING TASKS
With Congress out of the way, the
President thinks of business and ag
ticulture, and his administrators can
get down to work and put the latest
latch of legislation into operation.
This might be possible, except for
one thing. Most New Deal adminis
trators begin wandering about in a
daze as soon as F.R. is out of town.
Just remember what happened while
he took his Florida fishing trip. This
summer the President will be on his
way to Hawaii.
This situation is still the weakest
part of the New Deal, and it has

| grown weaker instead of stronger.
The President is the only effective:
I correlating agency in the Adminis- |
tration. Without him, Cabinet mem- |
bers, "brain trust," and New Deal
i agencies work at cross purposes, and
retard recovery instead of helping it '
j ctlong.
TOO MUCH FOR
ONE MAN TO DO
This is why the President is so (
tired. Just look at one of his latest
newsreel pictures; then remember [
how well he looked when he took |
office a year and three months ago. j
iAs many political observers have j
' predicted, the New Deal has gotten
tangled up in its own red tape. The
explanation is simple. As the only I
co-ordinator of the New Deal, F. R. !
I has to pass on an immense amount |
|of detail—enough to swamp three !
men.
The President has found it im
possible to delegate most of these i
tasks. Every time he has, the job j
has been bungled. The New Deal has (
become Roosevelt's personality; he !
must do all its work. This is too 1
much for any one man to attempt.
This is why F. R. is not asserting
hi: leadership as he used to do. He
is too tired and too rushed to go into ;
everything carefully. He is also too j
•vnxious to get Congress off his hands. >
Either the President will have to I
get some more capable help or the
second year in office will look very,
very poor when compared to the
first. At any rate, the President's
i job is more than one man can handle.

summer the President will be on his
way to Hawaii.
This situation is still the weakest
part of the New Deal, and it has

| grown weaker instead of stronger.
The President is the only effective:
I correlating agency in the Adminis- |
tration. Without him, Cabinet mem- |
bers, "brain trust," and New Deal
i agencies work at cross purposes, and
retard recovery instead of helping it '
j ctlong.
TOO MUCH FOR
ONE MAN TO DO
This is why the President is so (
tired. Just look at one of his latest
newsreel pictures; then remember [
how well he looked when he took |
office a year and three months ago. j
iAs many political observers have j
' predicted, the New Deal has gotten
tangled up in its own red tape. The
explanation is simple. As the only I
co-ordinator of the New Deal, F. R. !
I has to pass on an immense amount |
|of detail—enough to swamp three !
men.
The President has found it im
possible to delegate most of these i
tasks. Every time he has, the job j
has been bungled. The New Deal has (
become Roosevelt's personality; he !
must do all its work. This is too 1
much for any one man to attempt.
This is why F. R. is not asserting
hi: leadership as he used to do. He
is too tired and too rushed to go into ;
everything carefully. He is also too j
•vnxious to get Congress off his hands. >
Either the President will have to I
get some more capable help or the
second year in office will look very,
very poor when compared to the
first. At any rate, the President's
i job is more than one man can handle.
TRYING TO SEND
CONGRESS HOME
The President wants to get Con
gress off his hands early in June, or
sooner if possible. Most Congress
men want to get home to start their
summer and fall re-election cam
paigns. But there is so much to do
in such a short time that many of
ihe White House-sponsored bills
will have to be thrown overboard in
the shuffle.
Even if some of his pet bills have
to be junked. F.R. wants to got Con
gress out of Washington—for two
reasons. The first is that he is tired
and needs a rest; the second is that
he thinks the country wants less un
certainty about the future. It is an
old American custom for business to
have the jitters whenever Congress
is in session; the longer the session,
the worse the jitters.
IJUT THERE IS THE
JOB OF DELEGATING TASKS
With Congress out of the way, the
President thinks of business and ag
ticulture, and his administrators can
get down to work and put the latest
latch of legislation into operation.
This might be possible, except for
one thing. Most New Deal adminis
trators begin wandering about in a
daze as soon as F.R. is out of town.
Just remember what happened while
he took his Florida fishing trip. This
summer the President will be on his
way to Hawaii.
