# JOHNSTON PRAISES WORK OF DANTE IN RADIO HOUR SERIES
## Considers 'Divine Comedy' History Interpretation 
### 
As an interpretation of the middle
j ages, and as a revelation of literary
I power to express experiences and
Dante's Divine Comedy is unique in
j the poetry of the world, believes Dr.
I Oliver M. Johnston, professor em-
I eritus of Romanic Languages, who
I spoke on last night's presentation of
I the weekly Stanford Radio Hour
: over KPO.
An evidence of Dante's greatness,
j according to Dr. Johnston, is the fact
that in 1921 a world-wide literary
j movement commemorated the six
i hundredth anniversary of his death,
! and even part of the session of the
: League of Nations was devoted to
j this movement.
Dr. Johnston mentioned the fact
! that there were more than 400 edi
j tions' of Dante's works during the
| 19th century, and that at the present
I time the number of translations of
| the Divine Comedy exceeds the
| number of translations of the plays
; of Shakespeare or of the epics of
Homer.
Dante's influence is great because
: he had the power to seize upon the
I inner meaning of experiences and
I recreate them, because he had the
j power to express experiencs and
! idals common to humanity of ail
; ages, the emeritus professor believes.
: He had the ability to suppress de
| tails that would detract from the
â–  main impression he wished to make.
The program on which Dr. John
j ston spoke is part of a series of
broadcasts furthering adult educa
tion, and sponsored by the National
Broadcasting Company in co-opera
tion with the University.
