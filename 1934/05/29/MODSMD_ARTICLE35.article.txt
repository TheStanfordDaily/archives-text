SADIE MC KEE (MGM)
At the Stanford Theatre
This is a picture about a Thor
oughbred. Not a horse, you under
stand, but Joan Crawford. Miss
Crawford gives what is the screen's
all-time high in interpretations of
the Chin-Up School, and gets her
Master's decree in the School of
Hard Knocks.
The picture has everything: girl
rises from servant to riches; girl
makes The Mistake; the "good pai"
type of husband who "understands";
the "good pal" type of girl friend
who "understands"; the rich boy who
ultimately "understands"; the poor
boy who is the girl's onetruelove;
the Mae West type of vamp; the
comic landlady, the comic butler, the
comic; the tragic film of the year.
Director Clarence Brown has gone
berserk on "Sadie McKee," and the
only touch which you don't expect is
the ending—you forget that even
bad things come to an end. Nor is
Brown aided by the material he has;
the story, as (I hope) has been indi
cated, is not precisely novel; the
dialog is of the "I-dunno-why-but
it-jes-kinda-got-me" pattern; the
net result is to be avoided like the
plague.
The only redeeming feature of this
affair is Edwin Arnold's performance
as the regenerated drunk, and he is
pretty well snowed under by the
heroics of Gene Raymond, the stiff
smugness of Franchot Tone, and the
Joan Crawfordness of Joan Craw
ford. —Chapin
