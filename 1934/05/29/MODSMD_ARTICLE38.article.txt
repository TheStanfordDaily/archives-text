The Editor, Sir:
Progress in the- reformation of
Stanford's out-dated athletic awards
system has met with opposition
from some scholars unlightened in
1 his line.
One statement of Fullenwider's
sums up this backward situation:
"By asking for blocks the circlemen
are just attempting to put them
selves in a class to which they do
not belong."
The natural "class" distinction
which he would have, puts a light
sweater and a small block "S" en
circled by a white felt ring on one
athlete and puts a heavy sweater
with a large block "S" on
another athlete, is unfair and illogi
cal. Other contemporaneous univer
sities in increasing numbers, do not
degrade one earnest worker and ele
vate his schoolmate on the basis ol
ill-reasoned and unfounded discrim
inations.
The reward differences are going
to eventually be replaced by equal
ized sports awards as they catch up
with the times, with different sym
bols for each sport as elsewhere per
haps. This move is a preliminary
and evolutional one and assent i
thereto is mere recognition of that.
The evils of this difference which !
drives quantities of fine athletic ma
terial from circle "S" sports theieby, |
are many and unfaii*.
Let them be abolished
