# BULL SESSION
## STAR CHAMBER: 1934 MODEL 
### 
Beer - loving Stanford students
complain that in liberal 1934, their
bibulous instincts are being sup
pressed by the 17th century morality,
j Fun-loving Stanford students are
prone to gripe tit another campus
I anachronism which dictates rigid
! lock-out rules for the "800." JusLice
| loving Stanford students have noted
I that with the advent of the new by
! laws, the Men's Council has been
turned into a 20th century miniature
of a 13th century Star Chamber.
•
The by-laws have made the Men's
> Council one of the most important
1 units of student governmental or
i ganization. In 1934 B.C. (Before ihe
: Constitution), the Men's Council was
1 a glorified traffic court. The glory
| was added by the trial of a few oc
) casional victims of the "Honor" Code
system. In 1934 A.D. (After the
Dabbling), the Men's Council was
magically transformed into a High
Court of Appeals for Irregular Daily
Elections. The transformation itself
1 was all right. The change was not
complete enough.
With the partial change, the a sys
! tem of secrecy that holds in part for
hearings on the ''Honor" Code has
carried over. Thus, in the case of
the present contested Daily election,
witnesses are called forth to accuse,
I without the accuscd being present to
"I object, your Honor." As a con
sequence, any and all accused must
defend themselves against hearsay
evidence; must stand trial for accu
sations they have.never heard made
by their accusers.
Such a system may be efficient.
But it is efficient in the same way
that any dictatorship is efficient. It
| attains some manner of speed at the
sacrifice of personal liberty and jus
tice. But at Stanford, where time is
no object, it may be hoped that jus
tice is the prime aim of all student
organization. That being not an
altogether frivolous assumption, it is
proper that Men's Council procedure
should be further revised. At the
cost of delay and nuisance, Men's
Council meptings (in the case of the
Daily) should be open meetings—
open at least to the principals in any
case.
In the matter of traffic tags, it is
only of public concern' in so far as
such meetings afford good gossip— ;
that the meetings should be open to
the public. In the matter of "Honor"
Code difficulties, it is sti'ictly a per
sonal matter —particularly in those
cases v/here the accused is pardoned.
Bu't in any case, it is the 20th century
concept of justice that the accused
should be permitted to face his ac
cusers. That is not a concession, but
a fundamental right. Yes, Revision
Committee, your *work is not yet
finished. —Dave Mellinkoff

that any dictatorship is efficient. It

tice is the prime aim of all student
organization. That being not an
altogether frivolous assumption, it is
proper that Men's Council procedure
should be further revised. At the
cost of delay and nuisance, Men's
Council meptings (in the case of the
Daily) should be open meetings—
open at least to the principals in any
case.
In the matter of traffic tags, it is
only of public concern' in so far as
such meetings afford good gossip— ;
that the meetings should be open to
the public. In the matter of "Honor"
Code difficulties, it is sti'ictly a per
sonal matter —particularly in those
cases v/here the accused is pardoned.
Bu't in any case, it is the 20th century
concept of justice that the accused
