An autographed, large-sized pho
tograph of a painting made by Prin
cess Lwof Parlstghy of Hungary in
1910 of Edwin Markham, catches the
eye immediately. Markham's poem,
"To You," in the poet's handwriting
and bearing* his signature, is nearby.
A poem by the eminent Carmel
poet-philosopher, Robinson Jeffers,
entitled "Pelicans/' in his hand
writing and signed by himself, to
gether with his picture, call to mind
the work of this writer.
George Sterling (1869-1925), an
other well-known California poet,
has two manuscript poems, "The
City of the Sunset" and "To the
Moon," which attest his pains in cor
rections and revision of his literary
work.
Correspondence and other mate
rials of such famous authors as
James Whitcomb Riley, Eugene
O'Neill, David Herbert Lawrence,
Bliss Carman, Henry Major Tom
linson, and Katherine Mansfield,
serve as vivid reminders of the
genius and personality of these
writers.
Two noteworthy exhibits are an
original manuscript of one of the
tales in "The Mirror of the Sea," by
Joseph Conrad, and a letter of Rob
ert Browning dated March 6, 1889,
written to a Miss Irene Hardy of
Oakland, California.
Some of these materials on dis
play have appeared through the
