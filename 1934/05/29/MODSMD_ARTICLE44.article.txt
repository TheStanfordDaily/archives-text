WOMEN TO
ENJOY FINALS
Field Day, June 5, marks the end
of spring sports, and where there's
an end there must be finals, but to
the majority the sport finals will be
an interesting and amusing affair
with none of the customary cram
ming. Everyone is invited to attend
the meet and join in the free supper
to be served in the patio at 6 o'clock
during which time awards will be
given out.
There will be prominent campus
I people among the onlookers as spe
cially invited guests to view the
cream of the crop. Connie Curran is
general chairman and Carrie Richter
is chairman of the very important
committee which is arranging for
the free food.
A FULL
PROGRAM
The afternoon will start off with
archery competition, there being
about 15 top-notchers who are eligi
ble, having shot over 100 in the Co
lumbia round.
The tennis finals, coming next, will
be a real treat. The all-star tourna
) mentis now being played off, re
serving the final match for Field
Day. There have been more good
players at Stanford this year than
ever before.
The top eight who qualified by
completing their matches and who
are the all-stars are: Elizabeth Rest
ing, Margaret Diedrich, Betty Pearce,
Alice Philp, Betty Oppenheimer,
Carrie Richter, Virginia Swafford,
and Mary Mayer.
GOONS, GIANTS
EXHIBIT STRENGTH
The Goons and Giants have been
having a lot of fun on their private
diamond in their private league. The
Giants lead with three out of four
games, but the Goons are ahead on
the next game. There will probably
be seven games in the series, the
winner of four being proclaimed
champion on Field Day at which
time the two teams will reward fans
with an exhibition game, the victors
getting the baseball cup when
awards are made to all winners on
that eventful day.
FAIRLY
CLASSED
The golf tournament is over, and
Joan Macgowan has the distinction
of being the first Stanford women's
golf champion, officially speaking.
Dorothy Lyman, runner-up, was de
feated by 2-1. Jane Dearing won in
the second flight from Helen Ray by
15-2, and Barbara Patton in the third
flight 2 up over Frances Ford.
Although the tournament is over,
there will be a driving contest on
Field Day which is for everyone,
and to make it as fair as possible the
competition will be in classes accord
ing to time of taking up golf. Only
those who started not earlier than
September, 1934, will be in C class;
those who started not earlier than
September, 1933, in B class, and all
others in A class. In each class the
prize will be four golf balls.
DESERT SONG
MOST INSPIRING
Gliding through the water to the
rhythm of music, the swimming
classes were found to do their best
to the Desert Song. So far there has
been no adequate explanation, un
less it is one of those pointless jokes.
But there is nothing pointless about
the work of the swimming teams,
and an opportunity to see the teams
in inter-class competition will be
had on Field Day, that is, if the wind
is not too strong.
PAST AND
PRESENT
Dot Ann Jackson has the distinc
tion of being the only woman exami
ner for life-saving on the campus
excluding the instructors. Her work
. was highly praised by Hughling of
the San Francisco Red Cross who
passed her.
Kitty Ahrens, sophomore, crops up
to win some glory by clipping off
three seconds off Jackson's record
in the 75-yard free style of last year,
such record breaking making it im
possible for anyone to rest on his or
her laurels very long.
