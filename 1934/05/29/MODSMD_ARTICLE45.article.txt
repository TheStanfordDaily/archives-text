### Roger Kimball 
A neck-and-neck race between
| Alpha Delts, Delts, and Phi Psi's has
! developed from the results of the
I first three events in the annual All
- Sports Decathlon.
The Alpha Delts are leading in the
| organization scoring to date, with a
' total of 55 1 points, but the Delts,
! with 52 'i, are not far behind. These
I points are computed on the basis of
IJS markers for first place, 14 for sec
j end, and so on down to one digit for
i fifteenth place in an individual event.
Evn Is Held Today
Today's events will consist of the
i 50-yard dash, the standing broad
i jump, to take place on Angell Field;
j the soccer kick for accuracy, and the
| fence climb, all of which are to be
; contested on the soccer field. The
last named event requires each man
to scale on eight-foot fence and dash
five yards.
As the individual points have not
yet been compiled, they will not be
j announced until the decathlon has
been completed. However, the 15
leaders in each event, with their or
ganizations, are as follows:
Football sled gush —First, F. Wil
liams, Delt; second, Willson, Alpha
Delt; third, tie between P. Fuller,
Alpha Delt, and D. Allison, Phi Delt;
fifth, time between F. Bowles, Phi

Cups Arrive Today
The three decathlon trophies will
arrive on the campus today and will
probably be on display in the main
office of the B.A.C. Building this
afternoon. These awards consist of
a cup offered by the Daily for the
team championship, another cup
given by Marvie Kahn, intramural
sports manager, to the individual
winner of the decathlon, and the
Athletic Faculty trophy, which is to
1 be engraved with the winner's name
and placed in the trophy room.
Among this afternoon's events the
soccer kick and fence climb will be
watched with spccial interest, since
they are more unusual than the 50-
yard dash or broad jump, and also
because they are counted more
heavily in tabulating final results.
The fence climb, in particular, is a
difficult event, and is accordingly
given added importance, following
the system of decathlon scoring
which is used in the Olympic Games.

Cups Arrive Today
The three decathlon trophies will
arrive on the campus today and will
probably be on display in the main
office of the B.A.C. Building this
afternoon. These awards consist of
a cup offered by the Daily for the
team championship, another cup
given by Marvie Kahn, intramural
sports manager, to the individual
winner of the decathlon, and the
Athletic Faculty trophy, which is to
1 be engraved with the winner's name
and placed in the trophy room.
Among this afternoon's events the
soccer kick and fence climb will be
watched with spccial interest, since
they are more unusual than the 50-
yard dash or broad jump, and also
because they are counted more
heavily in tabulating final results.
The fence climb, in particular, is a
difficult event, and is accordingly
given added importance, following
the system of decathlon scoring
which is used in the Olympic Games.
A neck-and-neck race between
| Alpha Delts, Delts, and Phi Psi's has
! developed from the results of the
I first three events in the annual All
- Sports Decathlon.
The Alpha Delts are leading in the
| organization scoring to date, with a
' total of 55 1 points, but the Delts,
! with 52 'i, are not far behind. These
I points are computed on the basis of
IJS markers for first place, 14 for sec
j end, and so on down to one digit for

Cups Arrive Today
The three decathlon trophies will
arrive on the campus today and will
probably be on display in the main
office of the B.A.C. Building this
afternoon. These awards consist of
a cup offered by the Daily for the
team championship, another cup
given by Marvie Kahn, intramural
sports manager, to the individual
winner of the decathlon, and the
Athletic Faculty trophy, which is to
1 be engraved with the winner's name
and placed in the trophy room.
Among this afternoon's events the
soccer kick and fence climb will be
watched with spccial interest, since
they are more unusual than the 50-
yard dash or broad jump, and also
because they are counted more
heavily in tabulating final results.
The fence climb, in particular, is a
difficult event, and is accordingly
given added importance, following
the system of decathlon scoring
which is used in the Olympic Games.
