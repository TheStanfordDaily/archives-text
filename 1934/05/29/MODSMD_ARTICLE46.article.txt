The Rainbow, class "J"" sloop owned by the Vanderbilt syndicate, and
built to defend the American cup if she wins the right to do so, is shown as
she felt the wind in her sails for the first time. With Commodore Harold
Vanderbilt at the helm, she started from Bristol, R.1., where she was built
and made a trial trip down Narragansett Bay. (Associated Press Photo)
