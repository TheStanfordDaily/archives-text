# SENIOR NINE WINS OVER SOPHOMORES IN ONE-SIDED TILT
## 
### 
Stan Anderson's .strong arm work
from the pitcher's mound and Bob
Suvinske's heavy duty with the bat
for the seniors was too much for the
sophomores yesterday afternoon in
the second game of the interclass
baseball series at the varsity fiel.d.
As a result, the sophomores were
overpowered, 10 to 2, in a short, five
inning game.
Senior batsmen pounced on the
slants of sophomore pitcher Eliot
Blanchard early, scoring live runs
before the sophs even got to bai.
But errors by the soph fielders
played a great part in the senior
scoring, three bungles being made in
the first inning.
So Blanchard returned to the
mound in the second, after his team
mates had been held hitless, and
yielded three markers in the second,
and two in the fourth. In the mean
lime, Anderson held the sophomores
to two hits, which they bunched in
the third to score their only runs.
The triumph of the seniors places
them as co-favorites with the jun
iors, who defeated the freshmen 3 to
2 last Wednesday. And the school
championship will no doubt be de
cided when the seniors and juniors
clash tomorrow.
Friday will see a game between
the freshmen and sophomores at the
usual place, the variety baseball
field.
