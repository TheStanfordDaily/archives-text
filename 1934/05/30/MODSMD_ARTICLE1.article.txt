# TRACK VICTORS RETURN; SEEK NCAA HONORS
## I.C.4-A. Winners Will Be Greeted at English Corner Tomorrow RALLY AT 11 O'CLOCK Captain Meier May Take Part in L.A. Meet 
### 
With the return of Dink Temple
ton and his .seven 1.C.4-A. conquer
ors to the Farm tomorrow morning,
preparations will begin for another
Indian try for national honors.
The squad wiii settle down to
training for the National Collegiate
Athletic Association meet, to be held
June 22 and 23 in Los Angeles.
A'though 14 Stanford entries have
been submitted for the meet, that
squad probably will be cut for finan
cial reasons within the next week.

Final decision will await the return
ol' Templet on and A1 Masters, who is
now attending a meeting of the Pa
cific Coast Conference in Portland.
Besides Johnny Lyman, Slinger
Dunn, Sam Klopstock, Chuck Nim
mo, John Mottram, and Bud Deacon,
who captured the 38th annual I.C.
A.A.A.A. title last Saturday, the en
try list includes Captain Gus Meier
in the hurdles, Lloyd Schween,
Humbert Smith, and Howie Arthur
in the high jump; Phil Williams in
the broad jump, and Bob Reynolds
and Claude Callaway in the discus.
Meier's condition is still question
able, and he may not be in shape to
enter the meet. Even if his arm is
sufficiently healed by that time, his
lack of training will be a handicap
to his chances of placing. Klopstock
almost certainly will loom as one of
the favorites in both barrier events.
Because of the confidence gained
by his victory in the 400-meters at
Philadelphia, Blackman will enter
the Los Angeles contest with a good'
chance of placing well, and a possi
bility of winning. The seasoning he
received in the 1.C.4-A. may help
him to beat his old rival, Jimmy Lu-
Valle of U.C.L.A.
Lyman will meet Jack Torrance of
Louisiana State for the first time this
year in the shot-put. in one of the
biggest features of the meet. Tor
rance put the ball 55 feet IV2 inches
the week following Lyman's toss of
54 feet 1 inch, which itself shattered
the world's record by nearly a foot.
Dunn may find himself favored to
capture the discus, with Lyman ac
knowledged but a slight chance of
placing.

preparations will begin for another
Indian try for national honors.
The squad wiii settle down to
training for the National Collegiate
Athletic Association meet, to be held
June 22 and 23 in Los Angeles.
A'though 14 Stanford entries have
been submitted for the meet, that
squad probably will be cut for finan
cial reasons within the next week.

Final decision will await the return
ol' Templet on and A1 Masters, who is
now attending a meeting of the Pa
cific Coast Conference in Portland.
Besides Johnny Lyman, Slinger
Dunn, Sam Klopstock, Chuck Nim
mo, John Mottram, and Bud Deacon,
who captured the 38th annual I.C.
A.A.A.A. title last Saturday, the en
try list includes Captain Gus Meier
in the hurdles, Lloyd Schween,
Humbert Smith, and Howie Arthur
in the high jump; Phil Williams in
the broad jump, and Bob Reynolds
and Claude Callaway in the discus.
Meier's condition is still question
able, and he may not be in shape to
enter the meet. Even if his arm is
sufficiently healed by that time, his
lack of training will be a handicap
to his chances of placing. Klopstock
almost certainly will loom as one of
the favorites in both barrier events.
Because of the confidence gained
by his victory in the 400-meters at
Philadelphia, Blackman will enter
the Los Angeles contest with a good'
chance of placing well, and a possi
bility of winning. The seasoning he
received in the 1.C.4-A. may help
him to beat his old rival, Jimmy Lu-
Valle of U.C.L.A.
Lyman will meet Jack Torrance of
Louisiana State for the first time this
year in the shot-put. in one of the
biggest features of the meet. Tor
rance put the ball 55 feet IV2 inches
the week following Lyman's toss of
54 feet 1 inch, which itself shattered
the world's record by nearly a foot.
Dunn may find himself favored to
capture the discus, with Lyman ac
knowledged but a slight chance of
placing.
