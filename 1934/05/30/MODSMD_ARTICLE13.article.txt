# Vote on Theatre, Minor Sports Called Tomorrow

### 
Two issues of unusual importance will be at stake in a special election
called by the Ex Committee for tomorrow from 8:30 to 2 o'clock on the
j Law steps.
In one of these, students will be asked to add one dollar a quarter to the
, present Community Fund of .$l4, and the resulting $10,000 a year will be
: applied to the building of a Memorial Theatre.

In the other the question of giving*
; a Block "S" to those winning a third
! award in a Circle "S" sport, a pro-
I posal made at last week's Ex Com
! mittee meeting which started con
j siderable controversy on the campus.
If the proposal to add to the thea
| tre fund carries, the Ex Committee
| will then petition the Board of Trus
! tees, promising them this additional
j student contribution provided work
i is started on the building within the
verty near future, according to Jerry
Trautman.
"The latest bids submitted for the
j building of a theatre are very high,"
j said Comptroller Almon E. Roth last
I night, "but the Board of Trustees is
[ doing everything possible to get a
; minimum price. Anything donated
by students to the fund will help
I bring the start of construction
j nearer."
"It is obvious that the present As
i sembly Hall is obsolete and a new
| theatre needs to be built," reminded
I Harold Helvenston, director of dra
i matics.
