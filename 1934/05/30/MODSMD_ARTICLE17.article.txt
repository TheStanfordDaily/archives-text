# MUST AMERICA CHANGE?

This series of three articles is being presented by the Daily with the idea of acquainting readers with
current trends in world political and social affairs. While the Daily is, in a sense, parting from its policy of
having nothing but campus news features, it is felt that the discussion by Mr. Thompson is close enough
to affect every student on the Farm.

| not produce. England is only pro
ducing 8G per cent of what she pro
duced in 192!), but the people still
need the same things.
It doesn't make sense. The people
on a semi-starvation dole may get
excited, are getting excited. So
called "better people" in England arc
flocking to Mosley. If he gets power,
the home of Anglo-Saxon liberty
may become its cemetery.
But Hearst says that America is
different from the rest of the world.
And America, always more Hearst
ian than it cares to admit, believes
itself different.
It was once. But that was before
the western lands were taken up,
before our factories could produce
more than we needed. Now we are
just like the other western powers.
We all can produce more than we
need, but we cannot produce it at a
profit. Therefore, we close facto
ries. Men are idle. Factories are
idle. Farms are idle. Surpluses
everywhere and need everywhere.
Figures differ, but conservatively
we are producing about 65 to 70 per
cent of what we produced in 1!)29.
Yet the need is still as great. Our
population has increased and our
production has gone down; though
our capacity to produce has re
mained the same or advanced if
anything.
Nothing in Wonderland or the
Land of Qz is so amazing.
The New Deal stepped in to do
something. Publicity filled the
papers and Blue Eagles filled the air.

Yesterday we saw that Fascism in
a brown shirt with Handsome
Adolph captured Germany in behalf
of the great industrialists who were
afraid of losing their industrial ma
chine. This machine could produce
more than Germany could consume,
but not at a profit.
In Italy, Fascism appeared under
c> black shirt with blustering Musso
i lini in control. But the set-up was
I I he same. The big capitalists backed
| II Duce to the hilt; and they have
| not backed in vain. Today, wages
[ in Italy have been further and fur
ther depressed; unemployment is
growing; but the syndicates are
guaranteeing profits at any price.
In Germany, they cry out: "Heil
I Hitler." In Italy, they cry out: "Vive
! II Duce." That is the only difler
ence.
And so in Austria. Depression had
made the people desperate. They
i could not sec the sense of going
: bare-footed with shoe factories that
| were capable of producing shoes that ;
j could be worn. The financial big
j shots grew worried. The opposition
1 was forced out of the government i
1 with guns and bombs. Fascism took i
j control. In Austria, it's Dollfuss.
' That is the only difference.
In England, a dashing cavalier by
the name of Sir Oswald Mosley has
j drawn the color of his shirts from
' Italy, his methods from Hitler. He
I hopes to do the same thing in Eng
j land. England can produce plenty,
1 but not al a prolit; so England does |

| Wages were to be upped to increase
I purchasing power. Hours were to be
1 cut to increase employment. And
prices were not to be so raised as to
defeat the wage gain.
Yet how could 4 his be done with
out killing profits? How can rugged
' individual grabbers make profits
1 with increased wages and shortened
hours? They cannot. They realize
(hat. Therefore when men strike to
get higher wages and shorter hours,
they are fought with scabs, publicity,
cries of "red" (in San Francisco)
: with the added element of bullets
(in Toledo).
What must result? The big capi
talists and industrialists here will
want the free hand to unlimited
profits that they wanted in Germany
j and Italy. They will not ask for them
directly here, just as they didn't ask
for them directly there.
We will have fanfares without end.
Maybe, they will tell us the Negroes
j or the Catholics are causing the de
! pression here, as they were told in
Germany, it was the Jews. Maybe,
they will say those who speak out
in the exercise of the right of free
press are "trouble makers." Maybe,
they will say the "unions" are ob
structionists. Maybe, we will all get
i excited and fight a war with some
body. Wars always stop criticism at
home and yield great profits as well.
When these things happen, we will
have Fascism in America, whether
j we run around in black shirts, blue
shirts, brown shirts, or no shirts
at all.

It was once. But that was before
the western lands were taken up,
before our factories could produce
more than we needed. Now we are
just like the other western powers.
We all can produce more than we
need, but we cannot produce it at a
profit. Therefore, we close facto
ries. Men are idle. Factories are
idle. Farms are idle. Surpluses
everywhere and need everywhere.
Figures differ, but conservatively
we are producing about 65 to 70 per
cent of what we produced in 1!)29.
Yet the need is still as great. Our
population has increased and our
production has gone down; though
our capacity to produce has re
mained the same or advanced if
anything.

Land of Qz is so amazing.
The New Deal stepped in to do

a brown shirt with Handsome

of the great industrialists who were
afraid of losing their industrial ma

more than Germany could consume,

This series of three articles is being presented by the Daily with the idea of acquainting readers with
current trends in world political and social affairs. While the Daily is, in a sense, parting from its policy of
having nothing but campus news features, it is felt that the discussion by Mr. Thompson is close enough
to affect every student on the Farm.
