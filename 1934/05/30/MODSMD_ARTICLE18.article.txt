# Committee Passes on 3 Charters
## Minor Sports, Theatre Election Tomorrow 
### 
Tossing off momentous legislation
in a closed session of two hours, Ex
Committee passed charters for Dra
matic Council, the newly revised
Rally Committee, and the Women's
Athletic Association, as well as pro
viding for the printing of local pho
tographs in the Daily next year, ap
propriating $225 to the sending of
Quads to secondary schools of Cali
fornia, and setting the important
minor sports and new theatre elec
tion for tomorrow.
On hand for the closed meeting
were the Constitution Revision Com
mittee to explain the new charters
to be passed. Last night't; session
completed all by-laws to be consid
ered except for Men's and Women's
Councils and Women's Conference,
to be acted in the last meeting of the
quarter, next Tuesday.
The sustaining of Business Man
ager Louis Ottenheimer's appoint
ment of Bob Herman as his suc
cessor, the Rally Committee charter,
and the special election are all ex
plained in adjoining columns of the
Daily.
Changes in the Dramatic Council
by the Revision Committee resulted
in the addition of four new mem
bers to the council and the elimina
tion of the A.S.S.U. vice-president.
Under the new plan the nine mem
bers will consist of dramatic direc
tor, faculty adviser, dramatic critics
of the Daily and Chaparral, dramatic
manager, student manager, graduate
manager, and member at large.
Meetings will be subject to the call
of the student manager, dramatic di
rector, and faculty adviser.
A minimum of four plays a year
must be produced under the new
charter, and the salary of the dra
matic manager will remain at $50
per play.
The W.A.A. charter was left un
changed. Under the charter the W.
A.A. will remain independent of
control by the Ex Committee.
Drinking off the campus will no
longer be considered grounds for ex
pulsion from the University, but
"conduct unbecoming" as a result of
drinking will continue to be consid
ered, according to a letter to the Ex
Committee from President Wilbui*
This confirms Crompton Bangs' new
interpretation of the by-laws on so
cial conduct which he gave to the
Ex Committee two weeks ago.
Drinking on the campus is still taboo.
Five cents of the 75 cents going to
the Daily, or about $150 a quarter,
will bo used for the publishing of
local pictures.
