# Where Experience Tells
## 
### 
The decision ol' Dr. Rav Lyman Wilbur yesterday,
wliicb lias beenâ€¢ received with thorough satisfaction by
the Daily staff and 1 by a great many of the students, brings
to a successful termination a* situation which has pre
vented this paper during the iasl year and a half from be
ing as productive and efficient as il should be. His sagacity
and experience in solving a puzzle which had threatened
good names of people and groups unwillingly drawn into
the case is appreciated.
For the past several days, the outgoing and incoming
Editorial Hoards of the Daily have been intent on drawing
up a plan which will, il is hoped, divorce politics and un
fair situations from this organization and allow it to be
built up to the level of efficiency which if should maintain.
The members have been fully cognizant of the difficulties
under which they have had to work. They are as anxious
as Dr. Wilbur and the Men's Council to straighten out the
mess. The co-operation which Dr. Wilbur's experience has
seen fit to allow should result in marked improvement in
the coming Volume.
