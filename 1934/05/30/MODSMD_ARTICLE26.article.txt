# Theatre Fund Should Be Supported
## 
### 
Tomorrow's special election lo decide if Stanford stu
dents are willing to hear their portion of the expense in
bringing a theatre to the campus to replace the Assembly
Hall, relic of bygone days, is going to climax a campaign
which was originated six years ago by Hammer and Collin
Society.
General campus sentiment during that period has fa
vored the move. Students interested in their own welfare,
as well as the betterment of the University, should not
hesitate in supporting the plan.
