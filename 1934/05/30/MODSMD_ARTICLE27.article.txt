# Lady Luck Favors Kidnapers
## 
### 
Throe Stanford men have been found guilty of kid
naping Queen Eleanor Harris of the Masque Hall and thus
perpetrating a hoax that let! echoes resounding up and
down the Coast ;it the blundering stupidity of college slu
drnts in tampering with California's legal machinery and
throwing confusion into the wheels of justice.
They are very fortunate that they will he let off com
paratively easily this time, with an innocuous punishment
that shall merely serve warning as to what might have
been their fate had authorities not been inclined to give
them the breaks on a first offense.
While the campus is pleased to learn that the kidnapers
have been brought to task, the Daily suggests that Lady
Luck is with them in that their names are not published
today for the public to read. Many contend that they
should be exposed at once to stop all possible repetition
of this sort of thing.
The merciful tendencies of Stanford authorities are to
be commended; the cold, cold world will not be so lenient
with those who try this kind of a stunt once they are away
from the protecting wing of Mother University.
