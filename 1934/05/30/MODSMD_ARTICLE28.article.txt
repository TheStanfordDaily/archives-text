OUTLOOK BLACK AS
CONFERENCE ASSEMBLES
Yesterday the disarmament con
ference re-assembled in Geneva,
Switzerland. Most observers thought
tliis gathering would merely provide
a chance to give the sickly confer
ence a decent burial. In the midst
of a rapidly re-arming Europe, it
looked like a waste of time to talk
about disarmament when nobody
really meant what they said.
So most people were pleasantly
surprised when the United States
and Russia showed definite signs of
doing something tangible about dis
arming. F.R.'s representative, Nor
man Davis, went so far as to say that
the U.S. is willing to reduce its navy,
join in an international agreement
to control traffic in war materials,
and even to consult with other pow
ers in case of trouble.
THE HOPEFUL
SIGNS—
If the United States really means
this, there is some hope for disarma
ment —sometime in the future. Al
though Americans as people and as
individuals may believe what Mr.
Davis said, Congress representing
(he people is likely not to.
Then Russia, always the first in
offering real disarmament, is actu
ally ready to enter the League of
Nations. Now the League is pretty
sick since Japan and Germany
picked up their marbles and went
home. But Russia's admission to the
League would put Japan in a bad
spot—at least for the time being.

Inasmuch as Poland is pretty
friendly toward Russia, and France
is vfcry friendly with Poland, Ger
many would be more isolated than
ever with Russia in the League and
playing ball with France & Co.
Another very hopeful sign is the
gradually awakening public interest
in the arms business. Fortune's ar
ticle on the shady side of the mu
nitions makers has sold over half a
million copies in reprint form. Con
gress is investigating in the U.S.
Even the French and English press
ore interested and smell a big story
as more and more dirt is swept out
of the closet.
—AND THE
DISCOURAGING SIGNS
In spite of all that has been done
so far —which is not much—Europe
and the world in general is re-arm
ing. Hitler helped things along, but
it was coming anyway. As the world
re-arms, munitions makers' profits
get bigger and better. Their invest
ment in the Hitler campaign fund
has paid 500 per cent dividends in a
year.
With arms manufacturers control
ling the press and the government
in ;it least three large European pow
ers, it is hard to see just how any
thing can be done until this subver
sive influence is stamped out. The
most encouraging thing is the grow
ing public interest and curiosity
about thi.s Arms business and why
wars start. If this grows enough, we
may have some disarmament some
day.

sick since Japan and Germany
picked up their marbles and went
home. But Russia's admission to the
League would put Japan in a bad
spot—at least for the time being.

Inasmuch as Poland is pretty
friendly toward Russia, and France
is vfcry friendly with Poland, Ger
many would be more isolated than
ever with Russia in the League and
playing ball with France & Co.
Another very hopeful sign is the
gradually awakening public interest
in the arms business. Fortune's ar
ticle on the shady side of the mu
nitions makers has sold over half a
million copies in reprint form. Con
gress is investigating in the U.S.
Even the French and English press
ore interested and smell a big story
as more and more dirt is swept out
of the closet.
—AND THE
DISCOURAGING SIGNS
In spite of all that has been done
so far —which is not much—Europe
and the world in general is re-arm
ing. Hitler helped things along, but
it was coming anyway. As the world
re-arms, munitions makers' profits
get bigger and better. Their invest
ment in the Hitler campaign fund
has paid 500 per cent dividends in a
year.
With arms manufacturers control
ling the press and the government
in ;it least three large European pow
ers, it is hard to see just how any
thing can be done until this subver
sive influence is stamped out. The
most encouraging thing is the grow
ing public interest and curiosity
about thi.s Arms business and why
wars start. If this grows enough, we
may have some disarmament some
day.
OUTLOOK BLACK AS
CONFERENCE ASSEMBLES
Yesterday the disarmament con
ference re-assembled in Geneva,
Switzerland. Most observers thought
tliis gathering would merely provide
a chance to give the sickly confer
ence a decent burial. In the midst
of a rapidly re-arming Europe, it
looked like a waste of time to talk
about disarmament when nobody
really meant what they said.
So most people were pleasantly
surprised when the United States
and Russia showed definite signs of
doing something tangible about dis
arming. F.R.'s representative, Nor
man Davis, went so far as to say that
the U.S. is willing to reduce its navy,
join in an international agreement
to control traffic in war materials,
and even to consult with other pow
ers in case of trouble.
THE HOPEFUL
SIGNS—
If the United States really means
this, there is some hope for disarma
ment —sometime in the future. Al
though Americans as people and as
individuals may believe what Mr.
Davis said, Congress representing
(he people is likely not to.
Then Russia, always the first in
offering real disarmament, is actu
ally ready to enter the League of
Nations. Now the League is pretty
sick since Japan and Germany
picked up their marbles and went
home. But Russia's admission to the
League would put Japan in a bad
spot—at least for the time being.
