GENEVA JOKES AGAIN
Yesterday the disarmament con
ference reconvened on the shores of
beautiful Luke Geneva. Everyone
agreed that the time had come for
direct action on disarmament, lest
the world take a tailnpin into a sec
ond World War. The men at the
conference were earnest men—or so
they seemed.
The day before, Italy (a member
of the conference), through its very
active mouth, reiterated the old Fas
cist bunk, that as it is the .sacred
duty of every man to bear arms.
Though Mussolini says war is good,
Italy—with smiling face and soft
spoken ideals—entered the confer
ence to end war. That is the first
joke from Geneva.
The first action of the conference
will be to make plans to entice Ger
many back into the conference. Ger
many, through its little black mous
tache, sings the same song of chil
dren for women and arms for men
that II Duce has been warbling now
these many years. Theoretically,
Germany is disarmed. Her every ef
fort, now, is bent not at disarmament,
but at rearmament. A Germany
dominated by Fascist terror and na
tionalistic blubber would not disarm
even if it promised to. Yet every
effort is being made to entice Ger
many back into the conference. Ge
neva jokes again.
France will never disarm until she
is assured that she is safe. That is
not utterly unreasonable. France is
not safe as long as Germany break
fasts on hate, lunches on visions of
radical superiority, and sups to the
tune of "Deutschland Über Alles."
But France, knowing she herself will
not disarm, is at the disarmament
conference. The story can be re
iterated for a half dozen nations. It
is a joke—but what a hellish one.
It is certainly commendable that
efforts are being made to secure dis
armament. But the hypocracy which
pervades the conference is most
nauseating. As long as any large
group of nations THINKS in terms
of armed victory, even though it
TALKS in terms of disarmed happi
ness, war continues to be the most
menacing of all menaces.
In America it is the fad to talk,
and even think, peace. Having
robbed the Indians, black-jacked the
Mexicans, and strong-armed the
Spaniards, we have had enough of
local violence. We are ready for
peace. But it is a cinch that Europe
is not ready for peace. In which case
America can be of the greatest serv
ice to herself and to the world by
keeping 120,000,000 people out of
war. America can do that by agree
ing at the conference not to insist on
"freedom of the seas" in the next
war. If that much is accomplished
by the conference, it will be a par
tial success. If America does that,
Geneva will still be a joke, but
America will hold the joker.

ing at the conference not to insist on
"freedom of the seas" in the next
war. If that much is accomplished
by the conference, it will be a par
tial success. If America does that,
Geneva will still be a joke, but
America will hold the joker.

GENEVA JOKES AGAIN
Yesterday the disarmament con
ference reconvened on the shores of
beautiful Luke Geneva. Everyone
agreed that the time had come for
direct action on disarmament, lest
the world take a tailnpin into a sec
ond World War. The men at the
conference were earnest men—or so
they seemed.
The day before, Italy (a member
of the conference), through its very
active mouth, reiterated the old Fas
cist bunk, that as it is the .sacred
duty of every man to bear arms.
Though Mussolini says war is good,
Italy—with smiling face and soft
spoken ideals—entered the confer
ence to end war. That is the first
joke from Geneva.
The first action of the conference
will be to make plans to entice Ger
many back into the conference. Ger
many, through its little black mous
tache, sings the same song of chil
dren for women and arms for men
that II Duce has been warbling now
these many years. Theoretically,
Germany is disarmed. Her every ef
fort, now, is bent not at disarmament,
but at rearmament. A Germany
dominated by Fascist terror and na
tionalistic blubber would not disarm
even if it promised to. Yet every
effort is being made to entice Ger
many back into the conference. Ge
neva jokes again.
France will never disarm until she
is assured that she is safe. That is
not utterly unreasonable. France is
not safe as long as Germany break
fasts on hate, lunches on visions of
radical superiority, and sups to the
tune of "Deutschland Über Alles."
But France, knowing she herself will
not disarm, is at the disarmament
conference. The story can be re
iterated for a half dozen nations. It
is a joke—but what a hellish one.
It is certainly commendable that
efforts are being made to secure dis
armament. But the hypocracy which
pervades the conference is most
nauseating. As long as any large
group of nations THINKS in terms
of armed victory, even though it
TALKS in terms of disarmed happi
ness, war continues to be the most
menacing of all menaces.
In America it is the fad to talk,
and even think, peace. Having
robbed the Indians, black-jacked the
Mexicans, and strong-armed the
Spaniards, we have had enough of
local violence. We are ready for
peace. But it is a cinch that Europe
is not ready for peace. In which case
America can be of the greatest serv
ice to herself and to the world by
keeping 120,000,000 people out of
war. America can do that by agree
ing at the conference not to insist on
"freedom of the seas" in the next
war. If that much is accomplished
by the conference, it will be a par
tial success. If America does that,
Geneva will still be a joke, but
America will hold the joker.
