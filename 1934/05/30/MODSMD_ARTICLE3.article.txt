# STAN BEAUBAIRE WILL EDIT NEXT AUTUMN'S DAILY
## Bob Herman Is Approved As Business Manager By Ex Committee; Verdict of Dr. Wilbur Interpretes Men's Council Aims 
### BOB LETTS 
Stanley Beaubaire and Robert Herman will be editor and business man
ager of The Stanford Daily, respectively, next fall.
Climaxing battles which have waged on two fronts during the last Week,
these decisions were reached yesterday by Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, in the
editorship squabble, and by the Executive Committee last night in the case
of the business head.

President's Letter i
Dr. Wilbur's verdict, while seem- I
ingly opposed to the recommenda
tion of the Men's Council, made pub
lic yesterday, was in reality an in- I
terpretation of the aims and hopes of '
the council. His letter to Richard B. j
Miles, council chairman, follows:
"Dear Mr. Miles:
"May I thank you for the earnest
and persistent work which you have
done to clear up the questions which
have arisen following election for
editor of The Stanford Daily.
"Because of the confusion and the
diametrically opposed testimony it
seems unwise to reopen the whole
subject at this late date, and to test
again a system of election that has
been shown to be faulty. It seems j
better policy to me to place Mr.
Beaubaire, the successful candidate,
on strict pi'obation to the Council
and President. Mr. Beaubaire's rec
ord is such that he can be trusted to
represent the whole Student Body
and to be fair and above board. A
re-election would exaggerate certain
differences in the staff that should |
be forgotten.
Favors Change
"I am heartily in favor of your j
constructive recommendation that a J
committee shall be appointed by the '
Executive Committee to investigate j
the Daily editorial election system; i
to suggest a new plan for said elec- 1
tions, which will be more practical j
and less conducive to unfair meth- :
ods; and to clearly define and es
tablish the meaning of the term
'subversive and unfair politics.'
"Whatever plan is adopted should
be clearly understood by all and all
elections conducted in such a man
ner as to obviate future criticism. I;
think that the objects of the Men's
Council have been achieved in forc
ing to public attention the deficien- |
cies of the conduct of elections on |
The Stanford Daily*.
"Very truly yours,
"RAY LYMAN WILBUR, .
President." |
Banquet Saturday
As a result, Beaubaire will be the
j honored person at Saturday eve
ning's staff banquet, and the mem
bers of the editorial board and gen- '
eral staff for next volume will remain
1 as announced May 16.
Members of the council were very
1 agreeable to the President's an
: nouncement.
Herman Approved
Herman, who will be business
manager for the next four quarters,
j was named by the Executive Com- |
mittee after the group hud gone into j
closed session to hear arguments in
his behalf and on the side of Bud
Van Meter. Louis Ottenheimer, re
tiring manager and the man who:
recommended Herman as his sue- |
j cessor, represented the successful
I candidate, while Chuck Glasgow led!
the battle for Van Meter. !
Because of the rush of business j
which confronted it last night, the J
Executive Committee was unable to 1
go into a discussion of a committee '
for the revamping of the Daily's sys- ,
tem of naming editors. President I
Jerry Trautman probably will name |
; a group within a day or two.
Albert Guerard, Jr., who along
with Jay Graves contested Beau- |
j baire's election, announced last night [
i that he had withdrawn from the j
battle several days ago because of !
having decided to attend Harvard
University next year. He recently
S was awarded a scholarship there.
