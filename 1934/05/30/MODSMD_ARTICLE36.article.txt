# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It has always been my opinion that
anyone who runs for student of
fice is nuts. The recent goings on of
the Ex Committee and her petty
J satelite councils have served to con
vert my prejudice into a fact.
I suggest anarchy as the practical
j solution. As no one with 4 refined
intellect bothers with student office,
I suggest all government be abol
i ished. Let us set up a dictatorship
'of the Administration which, be
cause of their experience of years
and because they have seen more of
life than we have, could not do
j worse.
Meanwhile let us ground our ex
; officers in the teachings of Karl Marx
I so they may develop a self and class
consciousness and realize that they
are but patches on the seat of life;
I so they may drown their petty am
bitions in the class as a whole.
In short, if we could produce offi
cers who would accept their posi
| tions as a duty rather than as a
, means of glorifying their miserable
egos and of salving their childish
vanities, a government would be of
some use. But because of the yahoo
sense of values with which capital
ism has infested our youth, and be
cause we persist in electing hams
i instead of men, we can't.
Hoping you are the same,
Owen Ulph
