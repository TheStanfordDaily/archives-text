# DEFENDS CAPITALISM
## 
### 
! The Editor, Sir:
Mr. Spencer Thompson's article,,
"Must America Change" in the Daily
i| of Monday, May 28, is misleading j
and unfair to Germany and to the .
capitalistic system.
Mr. Thompson has ardently
brushed us the more gruesome facts
of Hitler's regime and has attributed
them artfully to the capitalistic sys- j
tern.
But he has ignored two phases of
the total picture which warrant quite
different conclusions. In the first J
1 place, the rise of the Hitler govern- |
ment in Germany is not entirely a !
1 result of the failure of the capital
istic system there. And secondly,
: only a very few of those conditions
which did bring about the rise of
Hitler in Germany exist in the I
United States at the present time.
Therefore there is only a very re
mote danger that myself or Mr.
Thompson or any other social in- I
dividual in America will be injected j
with syphillis germs or with em
barrassing quantities of castor oil by
an army of militant capitalists.
I recognize, as does Mr. Thompson,
that the capitalistic regime has been
j unfair to many of us. But I am also
conscious that the system has been
! at least partly i-esponsible for giving ;
me and Mr. Thompson and most 1
people a standard of living and a de- j
: gree of personal freedom which hasj
been unheard-of in any other epoch j
or under any other regime.
Let Mr. Thompson cry, "Wolf!'
Wolf!" all he wants. But still if the '
wolf is Germany's wolf and if thei'e j
1 is only a very faint shadow of a wolf j
in the United States then it seems
to me that the Communist's night- j
mare which Mr. Thompson has so [
artfully composed for us is more in- j
teresting as a case for a psychologi
i cal study than as a sound piece of
, political criticism. Austin E. Fife
