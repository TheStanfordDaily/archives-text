JOURNEY TO TIIE END OF THE
NKJHT. By Louis~Ferdinand Ce
line. Little, Brown. $2.50.
A book which causes the furore
' of a scandal in Europe is usually a
; moderate shocker when it reaches
i renaissance in American translation!
| "Journey to the End of the Night''
I suffers in this way. A vicious,
amazing, Rabelaisian book to Paris,
j in translation it is cynical, imagina
j tive, uneven.
I Envisaging the nervous vagabond
j age of an "underdog," Celine draws
; crisp, colorful pictures around his
| hero's intense adventures in Africa,
lin America, in suburban Paris. As
! lie writes, the landscapes, the inci
dental characters assume a distorted
j passion like that of the hero Ferdi-
I nand, whose emotional experiences,
I sensitive and frequent, are fluctuant,
i often electric, always vivid.
1 The author's curious vision of the
1 world takes a definitely destructive

point of view, which is at the same
time elaborately imaginative De
signed from and for the "underdog,"
the book seems almost to have been
written with a pair of poisonous
scissors.
Unevenness is not necessarily a
justifiable criticism. But in "Jour
ney to the End of the Night" what
appears at first merely nervousness
becomes jumbled thinking. This may
be due in part to the ambitious
translator, but certainly it evolves
mainly from the autobiographical
cynicism which slinks and leaps
down the dark alleys of this journey.
M. Celine can write succinct pas
sages which have remoteness, and
obscure passages which are trench
ant. Te has talent for expression,
but his first book is doubtless too in
timately himself. It lapses from
power* into monotony, perhaps be
cause it has so much more bile than
beauty. â€”Broughton
