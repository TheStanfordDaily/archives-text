GRID SCHEDULE
WILL BE TOUGH
Without a breather any time after
the first game, Stanford .is looking
forward to one of the toughest sched
ules in her entire football history
next fall.
There are several contributing fac
tors that will go to make the season
difficult one to pass without dis
aster. Because of Cardinal victories
in 1933, every team on the program
will be pointing at Stanford as they
have habitually pointed at Southern
California for several years.
"Everything to win, nothing to
lose," will be the basis on which each
of Stanford's 10 opponents enters its
game with the Indians. And each tilt
necessarily will have to be just an
other contest to Tiny Thornhill's
squad.
TROJANS POINTING
FOR CARD GAME
In jjast years, U.S.C. has built her
season with both California and
Stanford in mind. This year, al
though Troy will do some concen
trating on California, Howard Jones
will forget the Bears until after the
Stanford game two weeks earlier.
And up until the Card-Trojan tilt,
the southern offense and defense will
be built especially for a thrust at
Thornhill.
Early last fall, experts predicted
that Stanford and California would
both be fair last fall, "but just wait
until 1934." The latter was a pre
diction of power on the part of both
teams. Stanford surprised by de
veloping a sophomore team more
rapidly than expected, and the pool
hall intelligentsia are boosting Stan
ford to lake the skies already. They
seem to forget their 1933 predictions
concerning California. And the Bears
are going to be good. Not only that,
but they will, as usual, be pointing
their season at Stanford. On top of
all that, the Indians' position will
place U.C. in the best possible psy
chological spot.
HUSKIES TO BE
TAKEN SERIOUSLY
So much for the only two teams
Stanford can hope to point for. There
will be a Washington team, also a
veteran and powerful squad, that
defeated Stanford last year and is
anxious to duplicate. Stanford has
not won from the Huskies in four
years, and the Seattle gridmen are
anxious to continue holding their i
jinx over Cardinal heads. They will 1
have enough power to attempt this
seriously.
Between what is destined to be a
tough Washington encounter and a
tougher U.S.C. clash, Stanford will
make a trip to U.C.L.A., youngest of
Coast Conference members. The
Bruins, rapidly reaching the climax
of their five-year-plan to lead the
Coast in football, will be hard to
beat. Last year Farm gndders man
aged to turn back the Westwood in
vaders by a mere 3-0 score.
EARLY GAMES
ALSO DIFFICULT
Stanford will have trouble early
next fall, also. San Jose State, the
first team on the schedule, will be
closer to a set-up than will anyone
else, but the Spartans "will be at the
top of the smaller schools and may
press a still-disorganized Card 11.
Santa Clara, second on the pro
gram, is always tough and will be a
much harder nut to crack so early
in the year. Then, before coaches
will have a chance to install any ele
ment of smoothness into the Indian
< ffense, Stanford will make a voyage
lo Portland to take on a stubborn
Oregon State team, the same that
held the mighty Troy to a 0-0 tie
last year. Any trip to the Northwest
also carries the hazard of rain, which
will be as fatal to the speedy Red
skins next fall as it was on two oc
casions last season.
WILDCATS WILL
FURNISH TROUBLE
Immediately after returning from
Portland, Stanford must prepare for
a Northwestern invasion on the fol
lowing week-end, October 13. Ha
bitually near the top of the Big Ten,
the Wildcats admittedly had a bad
season in 1933, but even then they
held Stanford to a scoreless dead
lock. They undoubtedly will be bet
ter, and they also will be pointing
for their intersectional clash.
Then will come a fighting San
Francisco University squad, which
so nearly upset the Cards at their
last meeting. Stanford would like to
take a breath at this point in the
schedule in anticipation of the en
suing games with Washington, U.C.

L.A., U.S.C., and California, but the
Dons in all probability will not per
mit that breath to be very deep.
