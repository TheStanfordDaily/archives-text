Many of the nation's leading auto race drivers are set to start the long grind that leads to fame and
fortune in the Indianapolis 500-mile auto race Memorial day. Shown above are three of the leading con
tenders. Louie Meyer (left) was the winner last year and in 1928. Kelly Petillo (center) has the pole
position, having set a record in the qualifying trials. Wild Bill Cummings (right) of Indianapolis set the
pace last year for the first hour before he was forced out of the race. Below, a typical shot of the tiny
speedsters lined up for the starting bomb. (Associated Press Photos)
