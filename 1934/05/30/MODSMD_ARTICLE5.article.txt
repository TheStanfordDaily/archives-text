# Wilbur Asks Jewett Case Continuance
## Demand Climaxes Month Of Little Action 
### 
A vigorous and thoroughgoing in
vestigation into the death of Peter
Jewett was demanded yesterday by
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur.
This action was taken by the Uni
versity after more than a month of
ineffective investigation and inaction
which followed the discovery of
Jewett's body near Lagunita on the
morning of April 26.
Little Progress Made
At an inquest into the mysterious
circumstances which preceeded the
death of the 19-year-old freshman, a
decision was made that the youth
had died as a result of unknown vio
lence. Practically no other light has
been cast on the case except that
Jewett was in company with several
other Stanford students at a road
house near Redwood City in the
early morning hours of Apx-il 26 and
were thrown out for participating in
an argument with another customer.
Two members of the jury which
passed the verdict at the inquest
signed a minority report on the same
day asserting that the San Mateo
County sheriff's office had failed to
conduct an adequate investigation
into the case. No member of that
sheriff's office was even at the in
quest, it was further pointed out by
the report.
Action Stimulated
In what appears to be an attempt
to find the true series of incidents
which led up to Jewett's death and
to see that justice is done, Dr. Wil
bur made the statement which will
probably stimulate further investi
gation. His statement was:
"We are expecting the authorities
to carry the investigation and prose
cution of the case through in the
most thoroughgoing manner,"
