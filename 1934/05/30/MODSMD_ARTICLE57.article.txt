# Frosh Jazz Preference Shown by Questionnaire
## 
### PHILIP BERNHEIM 
That 75 per cent oi Stanford lre§n
men prefer jazz to classical music
is indicated by the responses to a
1 questionnaire sent last month to 339
freshmen by Neil M. Daniels of the
Music Department. The question-
I naire was an attempt to find the re
lationship, if any, between person
ality and musical likes and dislikes.
In this, the fiist study of its kind
ever made, the questions asked were:
I—Which do you like best (a) popu
-1 lar music or (b) "classical music "?
\ 2—To which type of singer would
; you rather listen (a) radio crooner
: (Bing Crosby, Rudy Vallee) or (b)
| concert and operatic singer (Law
-1 rence Tibbett)? 3—Which do you
; prefer in general (a) a good jazz or
chestra (Paul Whiteman) or (b) a
: good symphony orchestra (New York
I Philharmonic)? In addition, the

, recipient was asked to indicate the
number of years of musical training,
if any, he had received.
The 155 students whose answers
were acceptable (170 returned an-
I swers, 15 were discarded because
improperly marked) form a fairly
accurate cross-section of Stanford
i students. They were divided into
three groups. Approximately one
third had had no musical training,
another one-third had received from
one to four years' instruction, while
the last third ranged from four to 14
' years of training.
In each of these groups, about the
same 3-to-l preference for jazz was
expressed; only 25 per cent indi
cated what Daniels calls "art music"
as their choice.
This implies that there is little or
no relation between years of musical
| tastes, at least among Stanford stu
dents. This does not speak very well
of present methods of musical train
ing, Daniels claimed.
