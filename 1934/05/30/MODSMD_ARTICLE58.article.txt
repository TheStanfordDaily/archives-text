# ARMY PROPAGANDA DISPLAY FEATURES LIBRARY SHOWCASE
## Sketches By Polish Artist Are Exhibited 
### 
A study in war propaganda is the
theme of the new showcase display
of the Hoover War Library.
Floods of Allied handbill propa
j ganda was sent into the German
| lines by means of balloons. Some of
I the handbills were educative in
; character, and contained statistics
i of the increasing numbers of Amer
! ican soldiers.
The second appeal of these leaf
' lets was to fear. Cartoons showing
j the appalling condition of Germany
| were the subjects.
These materials were printed in
German, and after the Allied ad
vance had pushed the Germans be
yond the Hindenburg line in the
! summer of 1918, these handbills had
I a telling effect on the morale of the
I German soldiers.
One striking pnenomenon of the
1 World War was the effort of each
I government to exonerate itself from
j the stigma of war guilt.
I The attempts of the belligerent
! powers to clear themselves by pub
! fishing select documents bearing on
1 the outbreak of the war are reflected
in the following displayed materials:
i Austro-Hungarian Red Book, Bel
! gian Gray Book, Brazilian Green
Book, British White Papers, French
' Yellow Book, German White Book,
j Italian Green Book, and Russian
! Orange Book.
I A series of vivid sketches by the
! Polish artist Bohdan Nowak de
! picting war atrocities, makes up the
i rest of the exhibit.
