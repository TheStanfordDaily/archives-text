## Stands Erected in Riding Pen for Spectators 
### 
The Military Horse Show, to be
held Friday afternoon in the riding
pen adjacent to the Encina polo field
commencing at 1:30 o'clock, will
mark the 15th appearance of this
event on the campus.
It was in May of 1920, one year
after the installation of the local
R.O.T.C. unit, under the auspices of
the Farm's first military instructor,
Major Leroy P. Collins, that the first
Stanford horse show was held as a
part of a military field day. Fifteen
hundred spectators witnessed this
military exhibition, a contemporary
"Daily Palo Alto" account notes.
First Polo Match
A notable feature of this inaugural
show was a polo game between two
Stanford teams, which was the first
intercollegiate match ever played on
the Pacific Coast. The show was held
on the old dirt polo field near En
cina and was featured by several
horse races, a chariot race, and a
mile steeplechase.
For several years the show was
an all-University affair with classes
being provided for co-ed riders and
members of the faculty.
End Civilian Riding
From 1926 on, by order of Colonel
McCabe, then commanding the local
R.0.T.C., the show was restricted to
members of the military depart
ment, because of a War Department
order restricting the use of govern
ment horses by civilians.
Captain R. A. Gordan has super
vised the event for the past six years
and this is his last Stanford show,
as he is leaving here this summer for
duty in Monterey.
The public is cordially invited to
Friday's event. Suitable stands will
be erected around the ring to ac
commodate spectators.
