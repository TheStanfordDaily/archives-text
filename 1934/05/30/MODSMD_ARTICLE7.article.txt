# High Voltage at Party Unnerves Senior Skaters
## 
### 
One of the minor attractions
at the senior skating party
Monday night was the experi
ment conducted by several
Physics Department men. To
test the nerves of seniors and
senioresses, they stretches wires
across the walk outside Room
Tlie wires were charged to
a potential of 100,000 volts, and
then the fun began.
Several young women and
their escorts came skating
along. One of the women was
in the lead. As she approached
the wire, a spark two or three
feet long jumped from it to her
arm. To say that she was
startled would be gross under
statement.
Unfortunately, the experi
ment was cut short at this point.
One of the men said, "Let's get
those fellows." The experi
menters, overhearing this, has
tily dismantled their apparatus
and rapidly departed thence.
