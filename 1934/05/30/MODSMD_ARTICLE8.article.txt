# New Council Will Replace Rally Group
## Ex Committee Passes Rule Creating 3 Separate Student Bodies Activities Unit To Control A.S.S.U. Functions 
### 
A new Activities Council will be!
the successor to the Stanford Rally j
Committee, it was decided by the
Ex Committee in passing the new
Activities Charter last night.
Under the new system three sep
arate bodies, the Activities Council, j
the Rally Committee composed of
men, and the Women's Committee I
will take over all rooting section ac- j
tivities, A.S.S.U. dances, all charity
drives such as the Convalescent :
Home campaign, and all other spe
cial functions that the Ex Committee
shall detail to it.
Tlie Activities Council will be the
administrative body in charge of all 1
activities of the committees, and it |
shall assign duties to the two sub- ;
ordinate committees. The Council
will be directly in charge of dances i
and charity drives.
On the Activities Council will be
10 students, appointed on the basis
of their work on the lower commit- ;
tees. Rally Committee will consist
of 20 men, and the Women's Com
mittee of 15 students.
Provision for an adequate system
of trying out for the committees will
be sufficient to avoid all chances of
a "gravy train" activity, supporters
of the measure assured Ex Commit
tee last night.
However, in order to start the sys
tem, elections for chairmen of all j
three groups will be held by the
Rally Committee in a meeting soon. 1
The previous election of a Rally |
Committee chairman was thrown out !
by the Ex Committee, and all new
officers will be elected.
Two Bills took the place of two j
Johns on the Ex Committee with the ;
appointment of Rogers and Stark to 1
the vacancies left by Mottram and
Lyman, returning from the 1.C.4-A
meet in Philadelphia. â€¢
