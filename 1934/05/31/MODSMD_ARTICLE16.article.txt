# Nazi Stories Held Untrue
## Dr. von Klenze Arrives From German Visit 
### 
Dr. Camillo von Klenze, acting !
! professor of German at Stanford, i
believe the castor-oil yarns and |
j other aspersions about the Nazis' ;
1 are concoctions.
"I have just come from Munich, |
j where the Nazi movement origi- j
I natcd," declare Dr. von Klenze, "and j
II do not hesitate to brand such [
| atrocity tales as appeared on the j
! front page of Monday's Daily as en- |
I tirely without foundation in fact.
"We have experienced a great j
I transformation in Germany under i
Chancellor Hitler," remarked the I
i professor, "and at present probably |
I 00 per cent of the German nation ;
'stand behind him.
"America is the most favored na- j
i tion of history," went on von Klenze. !
| "You have nothing to fear from a I
circle of hostile neighbors. Ger- i
i many, on the other hand, has gone
i through 20 bad years of suffering and
; humiliation. The rising generation
has had very little of a future.
"I take strong exception to these I
I atrocity tales, because they only
! foment suspicion and misunder- j
! standing. They contribute to the
fanning of the v/ar spirit, which none !
I of us want to see burst into flames
i cÂ»new.
"For a true picture of modern
I Germany," concluded von Klenze,
| "I call attention of Daily readers to I
Dr. Robert Swain's account printed
in the issue of the Daily for May 22."
