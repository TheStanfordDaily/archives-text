# 23 Injured as S.F. Reds Join Dock Strikers
## Police Club Women; Rocks Fly as Mob Attacks Mounted Police Riot Involves 250 Youthful Communist Leaders 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 30 (/P).—
A bloody battle between 250 rioters
and police, in which 23 persons
were injured, took place this after
noon on the waterfront. It was the
second major conflict to mark the
longshoremen's strike this week.
One striker suffered a fractured
skull and was believed dying at the
Harbor Emergency Hospital.
Men and women hurled rocks
and tried to pull mounted police
officers from their horses but were
routed by tear gas bombs and the
clubs of police.
The rioters—asserted communists
— were pursued by police, who
knocked them down with blows I
over the head, pulled them from
doorways of shops over an area of !
several blocks along the Embarca
dero.
Police declared striking long
shoremen took no part in the riot.
Recently the I.L.A. here voted 1
against affiliation in any way with
radical elements.
Screaming women, leading a pa
rade that preceded the fighting, also
felt police clubs. The demonstra
tion, police said, followed a parade
that started fi'om a vacant lot where
leaders of the Young Communists
League had harangued a large 1
crowd.
On a big blackboard was chalked
in large letters: "Workers, let's all!
go to the waterfront and give the
strikers a hand and help them win
their strike! Be there 100 per cent!"
Between 250 and 300 men and
nearly a dozen girls joined in the
parade which moved to the I.L.A.
headquarters, from which over an
area of several blocks the rioting
took place.
