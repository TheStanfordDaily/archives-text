# Senior Class Endowment Drive Under Way Today
## 
### 
The endowment committee of the
Class of '34, hoping to better former
Senior Class Endowment records,
will begin its drive for senior pledges
today.
All living groups are to be con
tacted during the drive, according
to Bill Stark, chairman of the com
mittee, and those seniors living off
campus are to receive letters re
questing their pledges.
Individual pledges, says Stark,
have in previous years averaged
about $5 per person, and he believes
that if every member of this year's
graduating class will pledge that
amount the final total will exceed
that left in any previous year.
In the event that the pledgee\ is
nuable to meet the payment a short
note to the Accounting Department
will be a sufficient explanation and
the pledge may be revoked.
