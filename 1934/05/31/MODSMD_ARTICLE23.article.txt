# MUST AMERICA CHANGE?

### SPENCER THOMPSON 
This series of three articles is being presented by the Daily with the idea of acquainting readers with
current trends in world political and social affairs. While the Daily is, in a sense, parting from its policy of
having nothing but campus news features, it is felt that the discussion by Mr. Thompson is close enough
to affect every student on the Farm.

I Wednesday, we saw that the
American stage had been built, that
| Fascism was waiting in the wings.
That although the colorful props
'■ (shirts, banners, etc.) had not yet
I been moved into place, the principals
| were anxiously and studiously re
i hearsing their lines.
I Here in California, land of sun
' . c hinc and oranges, some of the char
; actors have been doing effective rc
-1 hearsing. They do not use the word
Fascism, for that, is a foreign word
and of necessity, therefore, unpatri
otic and un-American. But Fascism
(capitalism plus open force) is just
as nasty and oppressive when labeled
j "Americanism" or anything else,
i This year, agricultural workers
were getting fifteen cents an hour.
That was a starvation wage. They
struck. The farmers could not pay
, them any more than that and meet
their mortgages. The farmers had
| been too successful; they had pro
duced a surplus; and the surplus
1 could not be sold at a profit unless
• labor was squeezed.
i But there is a limit to squeezing.

The laborers struck for the trc
, mendous wage of i>o cents an hour.
i It there had ben a scarcity, the farm
ers could have paid that living wage.
I But because there was an abundance
| (more than could be sold at a good
[ profit), they could not..
The farmers became desperate. So
they organized vigilante committees,
armed with rifles and tear gas. Vigi
lante is a lovely word, dear in our
; history; but when vigilantes start
j terrorizing labor, there is no notice
j «'bly difference between a storm
trooper, a black-shirt, and a vigi
lante.
When there is abundance of things,
| profits are cut. Somebody must take
| that cut—the banks who own the
mortgages, the utilities that supply
water, light, etc., the farmers who
1 grow the crops, or the workers.
Interest is as sacred as the Const i-
I tut ion, utilities are more powerful
! than the Constitution (as the Fed
i oral Trade Commission has proved),
farmers are being kicked into bank
| ruptcy. There obviously was only
one group to absorb the loss in prof

its due to the surplus.
But farm labor, never notoriously
over-paid, could not take the cut.
They organized, refused to starve.
The farmers plopped between bank
ers and union. l ?, began to fight ihe
only ones they could —the unions.
That was violence. That was Fas
cism, people out to defend their
profits with force.
When a machine is studied by an
engineer, the weakest part is made
stronger. When the social system
develops a weakness, scientists say
the same should be done. But what
is done in the Santa Clara Valley?
Those who arc the weakest are made
still weaker unless they strike. They
strike.
There is something essentially log
ical in a living wage. Therefore,
when strikers demand one, and get
it, their employers yell, "Red." The
police who owe their jobs to ihe
ones who control the government
(and even a cit student knows that
money is practically the only thing
that talks in politics consistently),
