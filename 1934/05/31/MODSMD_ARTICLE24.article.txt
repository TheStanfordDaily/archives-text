# VOTE YES ON THEATRE
## EDITORIAL 
### 
For the first time since the inception six years ago of
a drive to bring a real theatre to the Stanford campus, the
student body has the opportunity today to tell the Hoard
of Trustees that the campus wants to replace that inade
quate old Assembly Hall.
Stanford speaks in hushed tones of the present dilapi
dated, antiquated, dismal, dank, and windy old barn
known more familiarly as the "Stanford Assembly Hall."
Stanford, if the electorate demands that the Administra
tion act immediately, within a year will be proud to offer
dramatic productions to packed houses in a new, modern,
beautiful, and artistic theatre Iluit will provide a complete
view of the staiÂ»e from every comfortable seal in the new
auditorium.
Jt will be indeed a novelty for a Stanford audience to
lean comfortably back in a well-ventilated theatre and still
be able to hear every word and see every action without
having to lean forward in nervous anticipation on the edge
of a most irritating and unfriendly wooden scat.
A theatre with adequate workshop facilities, sufficient
storage space, a proscenium high enough to flv the neces
sary drops, a spacious stage, rehearsal rooms and possibly
a little theatre included, and the other advantages too nu
merous to mention here, will throw Stanford dramatics to
the top in amateur circles, and draw many new stars to
the Farm to participate in the activity.
There is 110 organized opposition lo the drive for a new
structure. The need is recognized, the students will bear
less than one-third of the total expense, and Stanford shall
soon have the theatre the campus wants. It is important
that every backer express his opinion today.
Vote YES for a new theatre.
