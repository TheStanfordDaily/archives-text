reacts favorably to the theatre ques
tion in tomorrow's election, ex
plained in an adjacent column, ac
tual construction may be under way
next fall on the Memorial group,

Roth.
Previous years have seen student
funds make possible the Pavilion

"satisfactory in every way,'' says
Roth.
The new structure, built with the
combined resources of the War Me
morial Fund and student body fi
nancial backing, is slated to occupy
the block facing the present Art
Gallery. It will contain a theatre
proper, backed by the Memorial
Court which has replaced the tower
specified in original plans.
A rehearsal room, listed by Dra
matics Head Harold Helvenston as
a major need, will afford adequate
facilities for preparation of dra
matic productions. Council offices
and a green room will also be cen
tered in the edifice, as would mod
ern classrooms.
Bakewell and Brown, University
architects, have drawn up specifica
tions providing up-to-date stage
equipment, perfect acoustics, and
visibility, and comfortable seating
