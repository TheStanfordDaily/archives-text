# A.S.S.U. VOTES ON THEATRE, BLOCK 'S' AWARDS TODAY
## OFFICIALS JOIN IN SANCTION OF NEW PLAYHOUSE Trautman Only Dissenting Man as Campus Heads Urge Measure POLLS AT LAW STEPS Developments Outlined In Circle "S" Question 
### 
With two burning campus ques
tions to be settled, Stanford voters
will go to the polls today to see if
they are willing to help the Uni
versity raise money for a new the
atre and to vote on the proposition
of giving a Block "S" to third-year
earners of a Circle "S."
Polls will be open from 8:30 to
2:00 o'clock today on the Law Steps,
according to Joe Chamberlin, elec
tion chairman.
The passing of the theatre propo
sition will result in the building of
a new theatre in the very near fu
ture, or else the Ex Committee will
not petition the Board of Trustees
to add the assessment, A.S.S.U.
President Jerry Trautman has as
sured the Daily.
Opinion Unanimous
Practically unanimous campus
opinion from the President of the
University down to Ned, the cross
eyed janitor, favors building a new
theatre; and wide-spread is the con
demnation of the present monument
to drafts, rats, and spinal curva
tures.
Dr. Wilbur expresses his approval
of the proposition: "I hope the stu
dents will feel inclined to be help
ful. At the time we built the bas
ketball pavilion the President, the
Comptroller, the Board of Athletic
Control, and the student body felt
that if we are going to get some of
the things we need around here,
we'd all have to work together."
Hclvenston Favors
Dramatic Director Harold Hel
venston says: "The stage that we
have makes everything at least
doubly hard. Despite these difficul
ties, there has been a constantly in
creasing number of students en
rolling in dramatics courses. With
better facilities we might look for
ward to still larger registration."
The only dissenting opinion comes
from Jerry Trautman, student body
president. He disagrees because
"The University should build its
own buildings. Of course we need
a new theatre, but I don't think it
is up J â€žj the students to finance it."
Sports Pressing
Just as pressing is the minor
sports question on the ballot tomor
row. Arguments between major and
minor sports groups during the past
week have clarified the issues.
Frank Fullenwider, who circulated
tiie petition asking for a student vote
on the measure he wrote into the
athletic by-laws, defends his posi
tion:
"I set out to form an issue for the
students to vote 011. I think the mut
tered curses I hear on the Quad
when I pass show that at least I have
done that. I have also been wilMng
to t;ike a stand on the Block 'S' side
for the reason that there was no one
else willing to present it.
"The outcome of the election in
itself will mean little unless the stu
dents accept it as final regardless of
who wins. I hope all will agree with
me in this attitude and join all those
who have argued on either side in
voting according to reason and not
on personality or sentiment."
Dr. Bailey Willis recently spoke at
the University of Minnesota.
