# Shall There Be Equality?
## 
### 
Minor sports men who labor for three years and whose
efforts are consistent enough to win three awards should
be entitled tu wear a Hloek "S." This opinion is shared
bv sneh men as Tinv ThornhiM, Ernie Xevers, Jim Lawson,
John liunn, Harry Wolters, Harry Malonev, and a host
of other athletic authorities on the campus.
The men have been in the game for years, and they
have seen enough to be able to make a fair decision. If
they are willing to endorse the proposition being voted on
today, knowing that they are placing minor sports on a
more nearly equal plane with the so-called major sports,
that is an endorsement, which cannot be overlooked. A
wise campus will give the minor sports athletes their just
due at the polls.
