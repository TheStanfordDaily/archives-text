STRIKES ARE !
GETTING OUT OF HAND
There is no doubt that organized ;
labor would like to see the closed !
shop become a national institution.
The present wave of strikes looks \
like a finish fight between the A.F. !
of L. and open shop employers. La
bor leaders approve of the strikes, !
but are very much worried about !
the violence connected with nearly j
every one of them so far.
The more disorder and bloodshed i
there is, the less chance labor has
of getting public opinion on its side,
ft seems that Communist agitators .
have taken advance of the strikes
to incite the strikers to violence. I
This time the Red scare is no Hearst ,
stuff; many of the would-be organ- '
izers arrested in Toledo and Min- j
neapolis admit they are Communists. |
OPPORTUNITY OR VIOLENCE
Deliberate violence is no part of
the A.F. of L.'s program. The Fed- 1
oration's watchword is opportunism, i
It strikes, gets as much as it can
whenever it can, and then goes back I
to work and waits for another fa- j
vorable time to try for a little more. I
This is the idea behind the Toledo, j
Minneapolis, and Pacific Coast
strikes. The A.F. of L.'s leaders ;
have made every possible effort to i
avoid violence and disorder. I
But the chief purpose in life of |
Communist labor agitators is to pro
mote violence. They did not call
the present strikes but they have |

I been working among the strikers to
' work up the bitterest hatreds pos
! sible. Thus in Toledo yesterday
strikers returned to the scene of
battle against the National Guard
with truckloads of bricks, steel
j scrap, and even a few guns.
Some of the Communists have the
interests of the strikers at heart;
most of them don't; when the going
; s?ets too tough they pack up and
leave townâ€”without regard for the
betterment of the workers, who are
I left holding the sack.
VIOLENCE DOES
MORE HARM THAN GOOD
This is why responsible labor
j leaders are worried; they approve
of the purpose of the strikes, but
i are afraid Communist agitators will
! ruin all their good work by inciting
i the strikers to violence and thus
pushing public opinion over to the
! employers' side.
Some observers feel that the Fed
-1 eration of Labor has more to fear
from Communists than from em
ployers or the govenrment. The
I trouble is that labor leaders don't
\ know what to do; they don't know
1 how to go about getting rid of the
Reds.
They do know that the longer
, I hey stay with the Federation the
worse off the workers will be. Some
I A.F. of L. leaders admit the activi
ties of the Reds are an open invi
tation to the use of Fascist methods
by employers and police. Nobody
j wants Fascism.
