Jackson Barnett, 92 year-old Oklahoma oil millionaire, died unex
pectedly in his palatial Beverly Hilts, Cal., home. The agÂ«*d Indian, a
ward of the government and adjudged incompetent in 1912 was a
familiar figure in the city where his greatest diversion was directing
traffic in front of his mansion. This picture of Barnett and his wife,
Anna Lowe Barnett, was taken as they left a Los Angeles court two
years ago where the federal government sued to have returned to him
$550,000 he gave his wife. (Associated Press Photo)
