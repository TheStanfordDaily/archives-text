## FAVOR READJUSTMENT 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Within the past week, there has
been considerable controversy with
regard to the awarding of a Block
"S" to all men winning three Circle
"S" awards. We, as members of the
Circle "S" Society, wish to defi
nitely establish and emphasize the
following points as arguments in
favor of the plan:
First: The fact that the proposi
tion was- originated shows evidence
of considerable interest in its favor.
Second: The general attitude 01
universities in the East and in the
Northwest has been one of a "level
ing off" between the so-called ma
jor and minor sports.
Third: The Constitutional Revi
sion Committee, as a whole, is in
favor of the plan, as is the Execu
tive Committee.
Fourth: Coaches of BOTH Block
"S" and Circle "S" sports are de
cidedly in sympathy with the plaa,
as is evidenced by their unanimous
vote in favor of the proposition in
their last regular meeting.
Signed:
Carl J. Knecht, President
Circle "S" Society
