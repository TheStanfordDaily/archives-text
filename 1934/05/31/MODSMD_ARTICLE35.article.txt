# FAVORS CIRCLE "S" MEN
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
When a man wears a block letter,
the campus believes it stands for
outstanding athletic ability and hard
work, and that a circle stands for
less ability and less work. Yet the
award system is based on the the
ory that certain sports deserve
blocks, rather than outstanding ath
letes. The amendment which is be
ing voted on provides a way in
which able and hardworking ath
letes, regardless of their sport, can
win their Block "S."
Coaches "Tiny" Thornhill, Nev
ers, Bradshaw, Bunn, Ellington, and
Maloney have approved the amend
ment. A1 Masters, the faculty ath
letic committee, nearly all Block "S"
men, representative campus men
and women, and the Ex Committee
have given their approval; now the
stuaent body has the opportunity to
give its assent.
Not over 10 blocks will be won
this way annually, all by able ath
letes, as the three-year clause and
the coaches' promise to rigidly cur
tail the numbers of letters in the
sports affected means that only the
best athletes will be eligible for the
award. The change is an evolution
ary one, fair to men in all sports
and will bring justice and equality
to our award system. Why should
an athlete's sport, brand him "in
ferior?" Leo Cook
