# MORE LEADERS NEEDED

j The Editor, Sir:
Apropos of conditions which make
longshoremen strike and, according
I to Spencer Thompson, may lead us
into Fascism, allow me to quote
from Carver and Lester, "This Eco
nomic World," pp. 57-58:
"If we find in a given country
1 that managerial capacity, even of
a mediocre sort, is very highly re
munerative, why do not more peo
ple become managers and fewer be-
I come laborers? . . .
"One hindrance may be that the
colleges and universities of the
country have taken a supercilious
attitude toward business . . . di
verting much of the talent of the
country from business. ... Where
that is the case, the universities are
partly responsible for low wages
and widespread poverty on the part
of the workers. If, after having
succeeded in preventing the best
talent of the country from going into
business, leaving industries to be
run by second-rate and third-rate
men, the universities and their
| spokesmen would be acting very
stupidly . . ."
Stanford has, no doubt, done far
better than most universities. Still
of the 800 or so receiving degrees
j next month, only 40 will have re
ceived professional business train
ing.
Yours truly,

The Editor, Sir:
There is one phase of senior ac
tivities which is perhaps not very
well understood by members of the
j class and which has not received a
< great amount of attention. The ref
! erence is to the endowment fund
left by each graduating class,
i This fund is accumulated by vol
untary donations in cash at present
and, if that is impossible, by pledges
left by graduating seniors. Very
soon, each member of the Class of
1934 will be contacted by the com
mittee headed by Bill Stark, and
asked to pledge any amount, pay
able when financial circumstances
will permit.
This money is used by the Uni
versity for scholarships and for pro
motion of other educational activi
ties. We should like this year's class
to leave a very substantial gift. In
such a way, we are able to express
appreciation to the University that
| has meant so much to us and, at
the same time, help insure its con
tinuous expansion, with its accom
panying increases in prestige and
rank among the universities of the
world.
Is it too much to ask all seniors
to wholeheartedly participate in this
Most sincerely yours,
endowment fund? We think not.
