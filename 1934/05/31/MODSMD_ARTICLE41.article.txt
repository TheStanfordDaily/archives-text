# BULL SESSION
## "TIME TO RETIRE?" 
### 
"I am for the American Constitu- |
tion because we have had it for al
most a century and a half!" Well,!
most people don't talk life that any
more. It was once the fashion. But ,
years of college-trained bronx cheer
ing has been completely disastrous !
to the theory that "What was, and is,
is good." The popping of this bubble •
has caused much grief to hordes of
Fourth of July orators, to all those I
who think stripes and see stars, and !
to those who would rather not think
at all.
The fact that most people no longer i
stomach such i!logic does not deter i
an occasional outburst of the stuff.
But in the main, those who once of
fered such tripe, have advanced to j
a new position, basically similar, su
perficially sound.
I
The catch-phrase is now revamped |
; so as to be more acceptable and more [
insidious. "I am for the American
Constitution (or bustle, or hair- !
pins, or corkscrews) because it has |
given us a standard of living and a
degree of personal freedom which
has been unheard of in any other;
1 epoch, or under any other regime." j
The thing has taken. Those en- |
lightened people who would be in- 1
1 clined to scoff at the other pro
nouncement, will swallow this one I
i whole.
i
If you can show most people that ]
an institution (bustles, hairpins, j
corkscrews, constitutions) has ac- i
complished anything, they are per
fectly willing that it should continue,
, unchanged. "What was and is, if it
has been good, continues to be good.'
Which is tantamount to saying that
, "John Dillinger, an angel at the age
of six months, continues to be an
angel today."
It is entirely conceivable that what
is very good at one time, is very bad
at another time. It is entirely con
ceivable that a tree, which in its J
youth rendered great good because it
shaded the weary workingman, one
| day must be sheared or cut down
because it stands in the way of "pub
lic improvements."
This is not to say that the Ameri
! can Constitution, or bustles, or hair
pins, or corkscrews have outlived
their day. Each undoubtedly can
i still serve many important func- 1

lions. But each of them should be
kept only as long as they continue
to be useful. When the bustle out
lived its utility, the fact that it had
once done noble work, did not en
title it to a permanent place in the
hearts of American womanhood.
That was right. No one mourns the
bustle. —Dave Mellinkoff
