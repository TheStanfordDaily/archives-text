## SHE LOVES ME NOT (Lindsay) 
### 
At the Curran Theatre
Novelty is the keynote of this
madcap play about a fugitive chorus
gill who turns Princeton upside
down, and the novelty is at once the
asset and the liability of the piece.
The chief novelty is the setting,
which is divided into two large sec
tions, one on top of the other, and
two smaller sections on each side.
This permits the playwright a flexi
bility of action-range which is tfu*
nearest approach the stage has made
to tho motion picture camera. At the
same time, the author is inclined to
include gratuitous action merely in
order to employ the trick set. In the
main, however, the setting adds to
the play, and certainly enlivens the
tempo.
The plot is novel in original con
ception, if not in its denouement.
The chorus girl almost causes the
expulsion of four Pr'nceton seniors;
iri the meantime, there is the boy
who, after a broken engagement,
falls in love with Proxy's daughter;
the movies take a beating, Commu
nism takes a beating, Prexy takes a
beating, and the chorus girl takes a
fat movie contract.
The novelty and complexity of the
play chiefly explains the cast's in
adequacy, but honors go to John Ar
ledge in the role of one of the boys
and to Russoll Hopton for his press
agent characterization.
Philip Faversham as the hero is
not quite up to the task, but he man
ages a sincere piece of work. Doro
thy Lee has a field-day in the chorus
girl role, and she plays it too broadly
for either charm, conviction, or
comedy. â€”Chapin.
