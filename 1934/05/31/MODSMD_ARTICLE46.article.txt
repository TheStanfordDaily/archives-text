# STANFORD'S MOTTO BACKED BY LEGEND 4 CENTURIES OLD
## 
### 
The official Stanford motto is not
"The wind of freedom is blowing."
As a matter of fact, this has never
been officially adopted, and does not
appear on the official seal.
The only motto actually consid
ei'ed has been "Semper virens,"
which means "ever green" or "ever
growing," representing the redwood
tree which is the central figure of
the Stanford University seal.
"The wind of freedom is blowing"
was first used on a temporary seal,
because of a four-century historical
background.
Dr. Camillo von Klenze, acting
professor of German from Munich,
and expert in German literature,
states that the legend originated in
the sixteenth century by Prince Ul
rich von Hutten, of the Bavarian
Palatinate, during the religious
struggles which were then going on
in Germany.
"Prince Ulrich von Hutten was a
friend of Martin Luther," explains
Dr. von Klenze, "and when Luther
was being tried before the Diet of
Worms, von Hutten came out in a
most vigorous appeal in Luther s
behalf, wherein occurred the famous
phrase: "Sehct ihr nicht dass die
Luft der Frciheit weht?" (See you
not that the wind of freedom is
blowing?)
