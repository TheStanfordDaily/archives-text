# Phi Kappa Psi Annexes Decathlon Title
## WINNERS TAKE 242 POINTS; CHI PSI'S SECOND WITH 180 Alpha Delts, Delts in 3d And 4th Positions 
### Roger Kimball 
Flii Kappa Psi won The Stanford
Daily 1 .-am trophy in the All-Sports
Decathlon yesterday by adding to a
big advantage to surpass all opposi
tion in the final three events. The
Phi Psi's totaled 242 5-7 points to
ISO 13-14 for the Chi Psi's, IGO 26-35
for the Alpha Delts, and 145 3-14
for the Delts.
The Chi Psi team was in fourth
place yesterday, but scored 80 points
at the finish to exchange places with
the Delts, who had been second.
Only four men each competed for
the Delts and Alpha Delts, five for
the Phi Psi's, and six for the Chi
Psi's; so the winners also had the
best average per man.
Stars to Compete
Johnny Mottram and Bud Deacon,
track stars returning this morning
from the 1.C.4-A., will be allowed to
compete if they perform in all 10
events today. Both of these men
would have good chances of winning
the individual championship, which
has not. yet been determined, be
cause of the complicated scoring sys
tem used. John Bunn and Marvie
Kahn are at present tabulating these
final results, which will be an
nounced in tomorrow's Daily.
It is almost certain that this one
man crown, barring Mottram and
Deacon, will go to either Howard
Clark, Jack Beach, Dave Allison,
"Wally Brooke, Fred Williams, Bud
Owens, or Jim Trompas. The win
ner will receive two trophies—a cup
presented by Marvie Kahn and the
Stanford Faculty Athletic trophy, to
be engraved with the victor's name
and placed in the Encina gym trophy
room.

Flii Kappa Psi won The Stanford
Daily 1 .-am trophy in the All-Sports
Decathlon yesterday by adding to a
big advantage to surpass all opposi
tion in the final three events. The
Phi Psi's totaled 242 5-7 points to
ISO 13-14 for the Chi Psi's, IGO 26-35
for the Alpha Delts, and 145 3-14
for the Delts.
The Chi Psi team was in fourth
place yesterday, but scored 80 points
at the finish to exchange places with
the Delts, who had been second.
Only four men each competed for
the Delts and Alpha Delts, five for
the Phi Psi's, and six for the Chi
Psi's; so the winners also had the
best average per man.
Stars to Compete
Johnny Mottram and Bud Deacon,
track stars returning this morning
from the 1.C.4-A., will be allowed to
compete if they perform in all 10
events today. Both of these men
would have good chances of winning
the individual championship, which
has not. yet been determined, be
cause of the complicated scoring sys
tem used. John Bunn and Marvie
Kahn are at present tabulating these
final results, which will be an
nounced in tomorrow's Daily.
It is almost certain that this one
man crown, barring Mottram and
Deacon, will go to either Howard
Clark, Jack Beach, Dave Allison,
"Wally Brooke, Fred Williams, Bud
Owens, or Jim Trompas. The win
ner will receive two trophies—a cup
presented by Marvie Kahn and the
Stanford Faculty Athletic trophy, to
be engraved with the victor's name
and placed in the Encina gym trophy
room.

the individual championship, which
has not. yet been determined, be
cause of the complicated scoring sys
tem used. John Bunn and Marvie
Kahn are at present tabulating these
final results, which will be an
nounced in tomorrow's Daily.
It is almost certain that this one
man crown, barring Mottram and
Deacon, will go to either Howard
Clark, Jack Beach, Dave Allison,
"Wally Brooke, Fred Williams, Bud
Owens, or Jim Trompas. The win
ner will receive two trophies—a cup
presented by Marvie Kahn and the
Stanford Faculty Athletic trophy, to
be engraved with the victor's name
and placed in the Encina gym trophy
room.

Flii Kappa Psi won The Stanford
Daily 1 .-am trophy in the All-Sports
Decathlon yesterday by adding to a
big advantage to surpass all opposi
tion in the final three events. The
Phi Psi's totaled 242 5-7 points to
ISO 13-14 for the Chi Psi's, IGO 26-35
for the Alpha Delts, and 145 3-14
for the Delts.
The Chi Psi team was in fourth
place yesterday, but scored 80 points
at the finish to exchange places with
the Delts, who had been second.
Only four men each competed for
the Delts and Alpha Delts, five for
the Phi Psi's, and six for the Chi
Psi's; so the winners also had the
best average per man.
Stars to Compete
Johnny Mottram and Bud Deacon,
track stars returning this morning
from the 1.C.4-A., will be allowed to
compete if they perform in all 10
events today. Both of these men
would have good chances of winning
the individual championship, which
has not. yet been determined, be
cause of the complicated scoring sys
tem used. John Bunn and Marvie
Kahn are at present tabulating these
final results, which will be an
nounced in tomorrow's Daily.
