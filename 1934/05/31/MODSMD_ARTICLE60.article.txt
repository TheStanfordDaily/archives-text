## Indianapolis Boy Victorious By Only 27 Seconds 
### 
SPEEDWAY, Indianapolis, May 30
(IP). â€”A home town boy, who runs
a small night club and rides in a
motorcycle because he likes its noise,
rode to glorious victory in the 500-
mile automobile race over the Indi
napolis motor speedway today with
j record-breaking speed.
One hundred and thirty-five thou
sand spectators sat under a scorch
ing sun to give thunderous salute to
"Wild Bill" Cummings, 28-year-old
Indianapolis driver, as he triumphed
over Mauri Rose of Dayton, in a dra
matic, thrilling finish, with only 27
seconds separating them.
L.A. Driver Third
Never worse than fourth and com
ing from behind in the last 75 miles,
Cummings conquered Rose by about
i a mile, with Lou Moore of Los Ange
les finishing third, seven miles and a
half behind the winner.
Driving every inch of the way
without relief, Cummings piloted his
! four-cylinder litter racer over the
perilous 500 miles in 4:46:05.21, to av
erage 104.865 miles an hour, breaking
the record of 104.162, hung up by
\ Louis Meyer of South Gate, Calif.,
in winning the 1933 race.
Earns $40,000
By his victory, Cummings, who has
j been driving race cars for eight
years, earned about $40,000, $20,000
of which he received as first prize
I for today's triumph. He won $1,525
in lap prizes; that is, sums of $50
to $100 for each lap he led the field.
Perhaps the most gratifying rec
ord breaking to speedway officials
was the fact that today's bloodless
I race resulted in no deaths or serious
I injuries, although there were three
j smasfiups, all of them of minor char
acter.
The most serious injury was sus-
I tained by George Bailey of Detroit
1 who suffered a broken wrist wher
his car went over the wall aftei
travling 30 miles.
