BIG BEN READY
FOR COMEBACK
Big Ben Eastipan, the Blazer who
kept Stanford constantly in headlines
th roughout the world two years ago, j
is just about ready for a serious |
comeback try.
Bjm, official world record holder |
over a 440-yard course and unrecog
nized champion at twice that dis
tance, is making a long uphill fight
to regain some of his speed and en
durance after a pulled muscle put
him out of competition during his i
last year as an Indian runner.
CLIMAX SET FOR
PRINCETON MEET
The clixam of his effort will come
at tlis Princeton invitational meet j
June 1G as the blond ex-Card star
tangles with the nation's best at 880
yards. Twice this year Eastman ha:;
completed the two laps in faster
time than that credited to any other
American athlete. In his first 880
appearance of the season, Eastman !
ran for the Olympic Club against !
Stanford in 1 minute 52.4 seconds.
Several weeks later, Ben again shat- I
tercd the recognized half-mile stand
ard at the Fresno relays in 1:51.5. !
Eastman has been dividing his
preparations lately between con- j
centration on speed and work on
endurance. Early in the season he
put in long hours on his sprint finish
and developed it well, but at Fresno, j
he decided he needed to add more j
three-lap grinds to his practice pro- |
gram.
BEN WILL MEET
NATION'S BEST
In the Princeton meet, Eastman ,
will receive real competition, and it j
may be just the added impetus
needed to make him look like the
Eastman of 1932. Entered in the meet
are Charles Hornbostel of Indiana, i
considered the premier 880 man j
among collegiate circles this vear;
Bill Bonthron, Princeton ace who .
captured both 800 and 1500-meters
in the 1.C.4-A. last Saturday, and
Glenn Cunningham, of Kansas, who,
although primarily a miler, may en
ter the shorter race. This will be j
the only event this year where this ;
outstanding group intermingles on j
the cinder path.
WILL RUN AT
MARIN SATURDAY
This Saturday Eastman will sub- 1
mit himself to a minor test in a spe- |
cial match race at the Marin County
meet. He run the half-mile
against a of two Marin stars, |
who will efch run 440 yards in a
relay against him.
Because of the Princeton invita
tional, Eastman announced yester
day he will not compete in the Pa
cific Association finals at Berkeley,
May 9. The former Stanford sensa
tion will leave for the East shortly
after this date and will be cramped
with finals on that day. Technically
his absence may cut him out of a
place in the National A.A.U. meet,
but it is believed the Union officials ;
will make an exception in his case. ;

BEN WILL MEET
NATION'S BEST
In the Princeton meet, Eastman ,
will receive real competition, and it j
may be just the added impetus
needed to make him look like the
Eastman of 1932. Entered in the meet
are Charles Hornbostel of Indiana, i
considered the premier 880 man j
among collegiate circles this vear;
Bill Bonthron, Princeton ace who .
captured both 800 and 1500-meters
in the 1.C.4-A. last Saturday, and
Glenn Cunningham, of Kansas, who,
although primarily a miler, may en
ter the shorter race. This will be j
the only event this year where this ;
outstanding group intermingles on j
the cinder path.
WILL RUN AT
MARIN SATURDAY
This Saturday Eastman will sub- 1
mit himself to a minor test in a spe- |
cial match race at the Marin County
meet. He run the half-mile
against a of two Marin stars, |
who will efch run 440 yards in a
relay against him.
Because of the Princeton invita
tional, Eastman announced yester
day he will not compete in the Pa
cific Association finals at Berkeley,
May 9. The former Stanford sensa
tion will leave for the East shortly
after this date and will be cramped
with finals on that day. Technically
his absence may cut him out of a
place in the National A.A.U. meet,
but it is believed the Union officials ;
will make an exception in his case. ;
BIG BEN READY
FOR COMEBACK
Big Ben Eastipan, the Blazer who
kept Stanford constantly in headlines
th roughout the world two years ago, j
is just about ready for a serious |
comeback try.
Bjm, official world record holder |
over a 440-yard course and unrecog
nized champion at twice that dis
tance, is making a long uphill fight
to regain some of his speed and en
durance after a pulled muscle put
him out of competition during his i
last year as an Indian runner.
CLIMAX SET FOR
PRINCETON MEET
The clixam of his effort will come
at tlis Princeton invitational meet j
June 1G as the blond ex-Card star
tangles with the nation's best at 880
yards. Twice this year Eastman ha:;
completed the two laps in faster
time than that credited to any other
American athlete. In his first 880
appearance of the season, Eastman !
ran for the Olympic Club against !
Stanford in 1 minute 52.4 seconds.
Several weeks later, Ben again shat- I
tercd the recognized half-mile stand
ard at the Fresno relays in 1:51.5. !
Eastman has been dividing his
preparations lately between con- j
centration on speed and work on
endurance. Early in the season he
put in long hours on his sprint finish
and developed it well, but at Fresno, j
he decided he needed to add more j
three-lap grinds to his practice pro- |
gram.
