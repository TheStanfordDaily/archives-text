# TROY HOOPMEN'S VISION FAULTY
## 
### 
Sam Barry, U.S.C. basketball
i iach, is trying to figure out whether
• or the psychologists are the vic
tims of one of nature's jokes. A psy
chology test at Troy showed that the
S.C. hoop men as a group finished
among the lowest in the school in the
matter of sight. The charts showed
that Joe Kelly, guard, and Sax El
liot, captain and forward, were the
least efficient in estimating distances.
Barry is now checking with Seattle
to see if Washington's quintet, which
beat the Trojans in the conference
playoff, is composed of blind men.
