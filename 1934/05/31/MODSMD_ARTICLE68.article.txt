## 
### 
Dr. Frederick O. Koenig will speak
to the members of the German Honor
Society today on his Bavarian tra
vels.
The meeting, to be held at 3:45
o'clock at the home of Otto Koenig,
2045 Cowper, will resemble a Ger
man "kaffeeklatsch," with a garden
jarty and the women dressed in Ba
varian peasant garb. President Claire
Mitchell will preside at this session,
the last of spring quarter.
