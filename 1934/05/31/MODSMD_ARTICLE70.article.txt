# CARDINAL I.C.4-A. CHAMPIONS TO JOIN TEAMMATES FOR N.C.2-A. WORK TODAY
## 
### Millard Browne 
Seven Cardinal track and field
athletes will join another Indian con
tingent of still-ambitious perform
ers this afternoon in workouts at
Angell Field.
The seven Intercollegiate A.A.A.A.
winners, who amassed 35*74 points at
Philadelphia last Saturday, in com
pany of Coach Dink Templeton and
Manager Sam Lowry, will arrive in
Palo Alto this morning at 10:28 and
will be met by a student rally.
Following festivities, the Indian
group of seven will team with other
members of the Stanford squad for
a week of concentrated drill in prep
aration for the National Collegiate

Athletic Association meet in Los
Angeles next month.
Final examinations beginning at
the end of next week will interrupt
the practice for several days, but
Templeton will have a chance prior
to the scholastic deadline to whip
his squad into shape after the east
ern sojourn and subsequent let
down.
Templeton probably will announce
next week how many athletes he
will take to the Los Angeles meet.
This announcement will be subject
lo approval of A1 Masters, now at
tending a conference meeting in
Portland.
Although his name is entered, it

' was stated at the B.A.C. yesterday
that Captain Gus Meier, who is in
the hospital with a compound arm
fracture suffered at a dual meet
with Fresno State several weeks ago,
has almost no chance of being ready
for the N.C.A.A. competition.
Meier will leave the hospital in a j
few days, but he will not be able to
don a track suit for several weeks,
and his injury has weakened him
so that he would be hopelessly out
of condition if he were able to en- i
ter. Consequently, the Indian hur- j
die responsibility once again falls >
on the shoulders of Sam Klopstock.
sophomore 1.C.4-A. low barrier:
