close five-inning ball game in the
interclass series by a score of 3 to 2.
The seniors cinched the game in
the fifth inning when, with the score
tied at two all, Anderson went to

ror, and then scored on the third
error.
The two runs for the juniors were
made by Mallatratt and Walline.
Anderson, Trautman, and Sabinsky
brought in tallies for the seniors.
Most of the live innings proved
to be a pitchers' battle with the
co-captains of next year's varsity
nine, Stan Anderson and Fred Her
inger, pitchers for the seniors and
juniors respectively, on the mound.
Massey caught for the seniors while
Wilson completed the juniors' bat
