GRADUATION

just a pair of Black, Brown,
White, or "what have you" ox
fords. They should be Correctly
Styled, Quality Built, Comfort
ably Fitted AND Honestly
Priced.
Shoes that you can wear at
Graduation and many other oc
casions with lots of pleasure to
yourself.
Such shoes may be had hereâ€”
in "Friendly" and in Curtis
makes from $5 to $6.50 In
