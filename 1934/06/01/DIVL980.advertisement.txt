THE LAST ROUNDUP
Seniors, Farewell! Lots of luck
we hope.
And may we suggest that when you
grope
For a place to eat that can't
be beat
Where family and friends you'd
royally treat
Bring them to the Main Dining Room
STANFORD UNION

Seniors
Don't you wonder how the influx of women en
trants will affect Stanford? What conquests the
"Nation's Best" football team will make? What so
cial events will happen? What records will Klop
stock break? How will the "No-Flunk-Out" system
work?* And what kind of paper will the Daily turn
out to be?
