# THEATRE POLL CARRIES 3-1!
## Block 'S' Awards To Be Given Third Year Circle Men CIRCLE 'S' MEN WIN FIGHT FOR BLOCK AWARDS Student Body Polls Decisive Victory in Contest For Minor Sports COACHES FAVOR PLAN Triolo Head of Committee For Investigation 
### 
Proponents of the Plock and
Circle "S" award plan were jubi
lant today over the decisive victory
of 566 to 195 of their proposition
presented for student approval or
rejection at the election yesterday.
Providing that athletes winning
three Circle "S" awards should be
awarded a first Block "S," the plan
has long been debated by coaches,
Circle and Block "S" men, and the
Ex Committee. That body last week
accepted the proposition, including
it in the by-laws to the new con
stitution.
Immediately, Frank Fullenwider,
Block "S" man who led the opposi
tion to the proposition prior to its
acceptance by the committee, began
circulation of a petition calling for
a student vote on the matter.
Inserted in By-Laws
Inclusion of the plan in the by
laws was the result of the concerted
efforts of the Circle "S" society, led
by Jimmy Triolo, chairman of a
committee appointed by the society
to look into the award situation
when the mater of by-laws for the
new constitution first arose. Ap
pointed on the committee with Triolo
were Gordy Graves and Gene
Brown.
Harry Maloney, director of minor
sports activities, upon hearing of the
acceptance said, "It goes to prove
that if anything is put before the
student body so that both sides of
the question are clearly understand
able to all, that body will always act
fairly and squarely.
Fullenwider Defeated
Said Triolo, chairman of the Cir
cle "S" committee: "I am glad that
ihe student body has seen fit to ap
prove the action taken by the Ex
ecutive Committee in doing justice
to the men in Circle 'S' sports."
Fullenwider swan song is: "May I
congratulate the Circle "S" Society,
the Daily, the Ex Committee, the
majority of the Constitutional Com
mittee, the coaches of all sports,
and all others who campaigned to
grant Blocks to third-year sport
men. The decisiveness by which
the measure was passed eliminated
all doubts from my mind as to the
merits of the contentions. The cam
pus clearly believes that the men
are deserving of the awards. Let
them be granted and respected.
Amen."
