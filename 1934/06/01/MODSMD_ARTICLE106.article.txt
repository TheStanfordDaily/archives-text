# JUNE, JULY ILLUSTRATED REVIEW WILL FEATURE SENIOR ACTIVITIES
## 
### 
Seniors not already familiar with |
the Stanford Illustrated Review, as j
well as those who know this alumni
publication, will find much of inter
est in the June and July issues!
which are to be presented to each
member of the class.
Both numbers of the magazine will
be written particularly for those who !
are graduating and becoming alumni !
this month. In the June magazine,
which will be off the press next j
week, Donn Tatum tells the class >
that "The End is the Beginning"— j
that the end of college undergradu
ate activities leads only to a wider
scope of alumni interests and con
tacts.
In the July number "Memories of
the Quad" will give the seniors a
printed record of the highlights of '
their years at Stanford, and the'
Commencement address will be pub
lished.
Showing how the graduates keep
in touch with the campus by means I
of the pages of the Illusti'ated, arti
cles in June will include Millard I
Browne's "Splaslfcs from Encina 1
Pool"—a review of water polo— j
Dink Templeton's own story of the
1.C.4-A triumph, Coach Eddie
Twigg's version of Lawson Little's
victory, and Harlow Rothert's
monthly section of "On and off the,
Campus."
In July a review of spring grid
practice will appear, probably writ- !
ten by "Tiny" himself, and again
"On and off the Campus."
The Illustrated Review provides;
the only medium for alumni to learn !
what others in the large family
doing. Each month news notes from
all the classes appear, and articles
are often written about "Alumni in
National Progress," with two or three
being featured in each.
In the July issue Bob Speers, '30,
a former Daily editor, will tell of his
work as publicity director for the
municipal water district in Los An

geles, and will write on alumni ac
tivity in this work. Other features
of this sort frequentiy appear.
Then for those interested in one
form of employment or other, there
are articles such as the one in the
June issue on summer employment
facilities of the University for both
students and graduates seeking out
side work.
