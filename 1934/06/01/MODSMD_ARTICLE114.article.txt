# Asks Seniors To Help Fund
## Stark Explains Nature Of Endowment Pledge 
### 
To members of the graduating class:
"As has been the precedent since
1927, the class of 1934 has decided
to leave a class endowment fund.
This class fund is raised by pledg
ing of the individual members of
the graduating class for annual gifts
after graduation. Subscription to
this fund offers you a way to par
ticipate personally in a tangible ac
complishment which the Class of
1934 will leave behind. The money
!;• to be used by the University where
the need is the greatest. This is an
opportunity to help uphold the high
standards of the University to which
you feel gratitude and which you
admire.
' Undoubtedly nearly every mem
ber of the class will want to pledge
something; the question is how much.
In the past, many students have
pledged an annual sum of about $5 to
the class fund; some less, and some
a good deal more.
"If you prefer to wait two or three
years before starting payment, just
make out a note to that effect at
the bottom of your card, and the
University will wait for that length
of time before starting to send you
a yearly reminder of your pledge.
In signing the pledge you reserve
the right to revoke it at will if you
find that your financial circum
stances do not enable you to pay
what you hoped to.
"So if you feel that your ability
to make an anual gift is only prob
able, rather than certain, do not
on that account refrain from pledg
ing.
"I earnestly hope and expect the
"Class Endowment Fund of 1934 will
exceed those of previously years.
Sincerely,
William H. Stark,
Chairman, Endowment Committee,
Class of 1934.
