# STANFORD AXE IN ITS LAST CHAPTER
## 
### 
Stanford's far-famed Axe came to
its final resting place two months
ago and closed the last chapter in a
long and colorful history.
Still in pre school when the Axe
"came back to the Farm" with the
aid of 21 stalwarts, the 1934 senior
class, nevertheless, was the first to
see it brought into the open and dis
played on the green field of battle in
the Stanford Stadium. And then
when a fighting Indian grid team
came from behind in the final min
utes of play to take a surprise win
from California, the Class of '34 saw
the Axe officials initiated as the Big
Game trophy.
The next chapter was the long
drawn-out business of getting the
now shining blade, inscribed and
mounted. Finis came when, without
pomp or circumstance, the Axe was
placed in a glass case in the Union
for all to see and none to touch.
