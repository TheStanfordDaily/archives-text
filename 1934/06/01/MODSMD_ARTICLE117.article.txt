# ENDOWMENT FUND DRIVE CONTINUES TO MONDAY: STARK
## 
### 
The drive for pledges for the En
dowment Fund of the Class of '34 is
progressing rapidly, with five living
groups being contacted and cards
being mailed to seniors living off
campus, reports Bill Stark, chair
man of the committee in charge of
the fund. The drive will continue
until Monday, he said.
In former years the individual
pledges have averaged about $5, to
be paid annually, and Stark urges
that members of the present gradu
ating class try to come up to this
average. If this is done, he says, the
present fund will exceed that of
any previous year, this increase be
ing due to the increased size of the
present class.
The Senior Endowment Fund was
begun by the Class of '27, and each
succeeding class has added its share
to the total. The money is intended
to give the University funds for
general use, and the income will be
used, at the discretion of the admin
istration, to meet emergency aca
demic expenses.
The pledges, which call for an
annual payment of the amount
pledged, are kept in the Account
ing Department, and in the event
that any person finds it impossible,
Ihrough financial or other reasons,
to meet his pledge, a note to the
Accounting Department will form a
sufficient explanation.
