# Seniors Have Seen Many Traditions Eliminated
## 
### 
Graduates of 1934 might be known
as the class that saw more traditions
abolished than any otherâ€”their four
years represent a real revolution in
Stanford history when time-honored
i institutions went by the boards.
The Axe tradition is no more. This
once bitterly contested trophy that
has caused major and minor squab
bles with U.C. is now at rest in the
Union Cellar.
The "500" tradition was abolished
last year when a meeting of the
Board of Trustees altered a ruling
considered iron bound. Ex Com
mittee has done away with the Big
Game bonfire during '34's history, the
flunk rule is now eliminated, and
the University entrance require
ments are lowered.
In all the Stanford from which the
seniors will graduate on June 15 is
vastly different in fundamentals and
externals from the one which they
I en tered in 1930.
