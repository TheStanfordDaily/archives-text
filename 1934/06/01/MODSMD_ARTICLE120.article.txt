### 
Our growth with time is bound in subtle wreath,
And time moves slowly with the changing breath.
From supple withe to fibred stalk, increase
Is slow and still uncertain. Where release
From crowded roots and the wry weight of wind,
Forestalling pressure, leaves that pain, behind,
The wand will grow in time, not straight or bend
But to that contour which its growing meant.
And we, within this over-arched space,
Which time and its contained transactions trace,
With striving much against a pace defeat
Are grown, not wise nor good, but more complete.
For knowledge, 'tis the substance of the mind,
The being, breath, and bone, wherein confined
The will must work. The sculptor cuts in clay
And with a tool, and yet the force and play
Of plane and blunted curve repeat the skill
Which practiced muscles in his arm instill.
Events resist, like clay, the mind's intent,
And knowledge is the skill that gives them bent.
