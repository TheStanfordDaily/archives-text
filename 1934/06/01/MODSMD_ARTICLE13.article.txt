j "The Student Body can look for- ,
ward to next year's Ex Committee
] as one which is made up of a per
j sonnel of ability. Ex Committees in |
' the past have made numerous er
' rors, and we do not claim that we
are goipg to be perfect. Next year's
] members are not going to serve only

will be allocated and the members
; are going to strive to put real ef-
I fort into these tasks. Hours of val- ;
( uable time are not going to be spent j
lin personal bickering. We will try

"The committee is not going to be
one of reform, but one of construc
: tion. Constructive measures do not
| have to be new ideas necessarily.
There are many times when a com
mittee can do its finest work by pro
moting and perpetuating that which
j has already proven to be beneficial.
: Many good ideas have died because
• of personal pride of student officers.
Jerry Trautman has had many fine
ideas which have fialed to mate
rialize because of the time factor.
I am happy to take up the good
| ones where he left off.
The Executive Committee is going
to be conscientious in furthering
i and protecting student government.
It will investigate and decide upon
trivialities, but not accentuate them.
| We shall concentrate upon measures
j which really affect university life.
. We will protect the finances of the
' students and use the A.S.S.U. funds
j for worthy causes. The Ex Com
! mittee will rally to the support of
j student activities and try to make
I next year one to remember.''
