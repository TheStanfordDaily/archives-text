dinal representatives stepped off a
j train in Palo Alto this morning and
were guests of honor at a brief
student rally on the Euglish cor
! ncr.

i ho wry, John Lyman, Dunn, Sam i
Klopstoek, A1 Blackmail, John Mott-
J rani, Bud Deacon, and Chuck,Nim
j mo, returned yesterday from a

j the national meet.
Meier Meets Team
Included in the reception coin
i mittee was none other than (ius
; Meier, who was permitted to leave
the Stanford Hospital in order to
| welcome the victorious seven hack.
Meier is still officially residing in
the hospital, following a compound
fracture to his arpi suffered five
weeks ago in a meet against Fresno
1 State.
Yell Leader Jim my Triolo was
j master of ceremonies at the rally,
i which was organized by Stan Bcau
-1 baire and his Bally Committee.
Templeton spoke to the student
! gathering, claiming that "although
1 have been proud of other Stanford
' teams and justly so 1 think more
' of this team than any other I have
; ever had."
Dunn, Blackmail Speak
Templeton then joined his fam
ily, and Triolo called on Dunn and
lilackman for a few words before
the meeting was broken up.
"Von could have cleaned up back
j there," Klopstoek told Captain Mei
; cr in an informal discussion of thif
meet. The sophomore low hurdle
| winner, who failed to qualify in
I Friday's high hurdle beats, said Ihe
track was so soggy that the com
petitors dug their holes with bare
I hands. His slight build handi
i capped him in the takeoff', and he
said he believed Meier's added
j weight would have been enough to
win hoth races.
The wet Held was also a handicap
\ to Mot tram, who placed second in
the javelin, his teammates said.
Mottrani went so far as to wear
i football cleats in an attempt to gel
a secure footing as be threw the
j spear, he said yesterday. Mottram
failed for the first time this year to
, get the spear to the 200-foot mark,
i and his best throw during the finals
j was 174 feet, lie will meet O'Doll
of Manhattan, who won the event,
J again at Los Angeles next month.
