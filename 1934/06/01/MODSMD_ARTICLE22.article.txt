# Drama Head Honored by Association
## Helvenston Will Preside At National Confab 
### 
More honors have been received
by the Stanford dramatic depart
ment. Director Harold Helvenston
late yesterday received a wire from
the National Theater Conference re
questing him to preside at the June
22 meeting of the association, to be I
held in Pasadena.
To Speak Also
In addition, Helvenston has been
asked to speak at another session on
the work being done in drama and
creative theater by universities and
colleges. Gilmore Brown, director of
the famed Pasadena Community ;
Playhouse, was the author of the I
requests.
The regional conference of the or- I
ganization is slated to last from June '
21 to 23, inclusive.
"I shall accept both tasks and am !
delighted to be asked," remarked j
Helvenston. It will benefit Stanford, j
he added in explanation, because it j
affords direct and good focal repre- j
sentation.
Prominent Men
Varied attendance is predicted for
the meet. Professional people, col
lege and university officials, little
theater authorities, and those prom
inent in the movie industry will all
be present.
Helvenston next year will be ab
sent from the campus on his sab
batical leave, after active years in
the local dramatic department. Be
sides supervising well-filled classes,
he directed numerous productions,
highlighted by the recent "Arms and
the Man," "Distant Drums," and
"Three Cornered Moon."
