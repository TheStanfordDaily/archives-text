# DECISIVE TOTAL SHOWS DEMAND FOR STRUCTURE
## University Officials, Students Concur in Enthusiasm Over Results of Vote; Final Decision On Question Up to Trustee Board 
### ANNALEE WHITMORE 
Piling up a total vote of 573 to 195, the Stanford student body yesterday
passed, by an overwhelming majority, the proposition that student financial
backing be used to aid in construction of a new campus theatre.

1 A margin of 3 to 1 indicated stu
dent consent to a quarterly assess
ment of one dollar, to go toward im
mediate construction of the long
needed edifice.
Official response was enthusiastic
President Ray Lyman Wilbur
stressed the fact that sanction of th<*
Board of Trustees had not yet been
obtained. "The decided sentiment of
the students represents a willingness
to help bring about action on the
matter," he commented.
Will Act Soon
The matter will be brought up in
the very near future, he stated, con
cluding that, although many uncer
tainties still remain, yesterday's vote
will greatly aid decision.
Comptroller Almon E. Roth was
conservative in predictions. The sit
uation, as he outlined it, is this: the
structure will take a certain amount
to build. Plans setting forth the
exact sum may not be available un
til October. On receipt of figures,
the project may or may not be con
sidered feasible.
"Knowing that the students are
prepax-ed to make a contribution," he
added, "and tax themselves for a
sum as yet undetermined, is of
course highly pleasing to me per
sonally. Now that the measure
passed, I feel confident that the re
sults will be eminently satisfac
tory."
Location Undecided
Plans, as yet tentative, will prob
ably result in an edifice occupying
the block across from the Art Gal
lery. Approximately $167,000 is at
present available from the War Me
morial Fund. In the event that the
sum required is unexpectedly large,
i outside gifts may be resorted 10, to
supplement student aid and the Fund.
Seating capacity will probably
total about 2,000, perhaps less.
Classrooms, little theatre, workshops,
offices, are all highly desirable, and
will be incorporated if possible.
; Latest specifications have placed the
Memorial Court in front of the
group. John Bakewell and Arthur
Brown, associated as University ar
chitects, will supervise construction
plans.
Kahn Comments
Marvie Kahn, incoming A.S.S.U.
head, also reacted favorably. Says
he: "The new theatre is a marvelous
idea and something which will
heighten student activities. There
will be plenty of opportunities for
new and old students to obtain from
Stanford something which they will
cherish. It is up to the students to
support the activities which are to
take place in the proposed edifice.
Let us take advantage of everything
it will offer."
Dick Frank, newly-appointed dra
matic manager, remarks: "The erec
tion of the new theatre will repre
sent a great step forward in drama
tics at Stanford." He indicated that
larger audiences, more ambitious
productions, better effects, will all be
made possible by . the action of the
student body in pledging support.
Jean Alberfeon, prominent dra
matist, "very much approved" of the
voting. "I only hope the Board of
Trustees acts us favorably," she re
marked.
Storey Praises
Marian Storey, Women's Confer
ence head, considers that "the new
theatre would not only be a splendid
thing for the individual student, but
for the campus as a whole." She
hopes, however, that payment can
be so arranged that future students
will not bear too great a burden.
Los Habfes, completing a term as
.student manager, added a final word
of commendation, stating that it was
"very fine that students continue
their co-operation with the Univer
sity to add to campus life through
this construction, without, loss to any
of the present activities."

The last Saturday night dancing
party of the Union club will be to
morrow night, Dance Chairman Bet
ty Hines announced yesterday. All
students are invited to the dance
which will be held in the women's
clubhouse from 9 to 12 o'clock.
