Dkar Stan:
I've been worrying about this darned editorial for well
nigh onto two weeks now, I sit for the last time in
the chair which you are abouJ to occupy—of all things,
I'm chewing on one of those Cellar hamburger sandwiches,
for which 15 good cents, plus tax, were paid. When you
realize how extravagant I am, eating a Cellar hamburger
(they call 'cm "Ground Round Steak" sandwiches), you
can appreciate the value of this epistle. It must be impor
tant if I could sacrifice in its behalf the enjoyment of such
an expensive bit of food.
To repeat the advice given me, and probably lots of
others, by a couple of ex-editors of the Daily, don't get too
serious in your work. At times I've lost sight of it, but I
have to smile now as I look back and realize that maybe
the Quadrangle wouldn't have collapsed if some of these
rootin'-tootin' campaigns weren't successful. On the other
half of the question, there always is room for improvement
(at least, so they say). In line with the latter argument,
Stan, you are in a position to do this funny old rag more
good than has been done by it in a long while. The result
of the controversy over your job has made it evident that
much revamping remains to be done. The staff is behind
you, and that is your challenge to get the Daily on its own
feet, for a change, and develop an interest in journalism,
rather than in politics, within the organization.
Really, Stan, you've got a swell staff —from the lop
down. Your editorial board is composed of aggressive,
journalistically - minded individuals; the night editors
should be able to plan their dummies and judge their news
values accurately; the copy eds, department heads and
reporters have given good evidence of understanding what
Hie score is. They're all there ready to go.
When you get back on the Farm next autumn and find
your oflice floor littered with mail which lias accumulated
over a period of several weeks, you'll get a big drive out
of looking through some of the queer communications.
About 1W.9 per cent of it will be the same old guff—such
tripe as publicity for the "Clioosing-A-Career Conference"
in Newark, and the unfathomable postcard notes which
some nut back in Boston writes every other week, and sug
gestions from the Italian Tourist Bureau that you spend
your next vacation in II Duce's country (what a compli
ment, considering the income), and letters by the dozen
from government cabinet offices which say, in effect, what
a swell guy the boss of the department is.
You'll be pestered to death by campus groups asking
for "a good story in tomorrow's Daily." You'll find that
everybody who wants space looks upon the rag as a glori
fied publicity sheet. Some of it you'll have to run. Some
of it you can minimize.
The fact that you are on probation to Doc Wilbur
doesn't mean that he will limit either your freedom of
speech or thought. There is a real man, Stanley. Prob
ably because he doesn't want to sway students, he seldom
offers advice. But he's free with it, if you ask him for help.
He doesn't want anybody to lean on him, but if some force
is trying to make one topple, he'll lend a helping hand.
Where before I only understood that Dr. Bay Lyman
Wilbur was a great gentleman, now I know that fact to
be true.
Marvie Kahn looks like the goods. That should help
you and the campus at large. Both of seem to have the
same ideals, and while you are bound to differ on some
issues I hope that you'll be friends in the end. Honestly,
despite a lot of severe criticisms against him, I like Jerry
(Grandma) Trautman as a person. 1 hope that he feels
the same.
Well, this could go on for pages. There'll be more to
say at tomorrow's banquet. And so, Stan old gent, I bid
you adieu with the satisfaction that your term as editor
will be marked by honest, clean, straightforward methods
and with the hope that when you step aside next February
you will have completed one of the best volumes in the
history of this multi-colored rag.
With a tear,
Bob
