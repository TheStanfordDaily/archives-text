THINGS DONE
AND UNDONE
On the wall of the editor's office
in The Daily has hung for the past I
volume a list of things which "were .
to be accomplished." In looking
them over, it is interesting to note: j
1. That we still don't have two- (
bit seats at the Paly first-run flicker
house.
2. That student owners of auto
mobiles still snub roughs waiting
for rides.
3. That professors still change
textbooks as often as ever.
4. That the rough (God bless him)
still is disappearing.
5. That students still insist on i
smoking during examinations.
6. That the grade curve system of j
handing out marks still is a stigma
on education.
SENIOR CLASS
CLOSES STRONGLY
Under an able leader, Donn Ta- |
turn, the Class of 1934 is winding up !
its days at Stanford in a fury of ac
tivities which is bound to leave a ;
lasting impression on the partici
pants. Probably there isn't a mem
ber of the graduating group which
hasn't got as much out of the school j
as he has put into it. True, some of
the return will be a long time conr
ing, but then who is bold enough to
think that the proverbial silver
platter goes with each diploma?
In accordance with a precedent ;
set seven years ago, the class is es- J
tablishing an endowment fund-, to be |
administered by the University j
where the need is greatest. As has i
been brought out by several worthy
campaigns, notably the drive to de
velop a Student Aid Fund, there are
individuals on this campus who try ;
to complete their higher education
under terrifically adverse condi
tions. The spirit back of the endow- 1
merit is one of the best things which |
the graduates can leave behind them. :
DECISIVE VOTES
INDICATIVE
The decisive manner in which
students yesterday declared them
selves on the matters of the new the- j
atre and the Block "S" awards for j
three-year minor sports athletes was
a relief. Had the votes been close, j
there could have been ill feelings, j
But 3 to 1 majorities are conclusive ;
and indicative of the prevailing !
feeling among the students.
DON'T LEAVE
YOURSELF OPEN
With the Administration watching
the Honor Code violations closely to i
see whether this idea'of self-control
for r.tudents is effective, it will be
healthy for people taking examina
tions a week or so hence to not lay
themselves open to suspicion. Coun
cil representatives issued that sug- !
gestion yesterday. A successful pe- 1
riod of examinations, from the coun
cils' standpoint, will result in a
more secure feeling among every- j
body connected with the school. So, |
don't do anything which might
cause a person to look a second
time. And if you see somebody else j
doing a bit of. cribbing, r. couple of
raps on the desk might end the j
cheating and lower the class aver
age.
PICHERS IN THE
PAPER! GEE!
Your correspondent nearly col- '
lapsed the other night when he j
learned that .starting next fall the I
editorial department of The Daily j
will be on a regular budget. Utopia!
But too late to do this volume any i
good.
Beginning next fall, however, j
student leaders, etc., will be "mug- !
ged," as we boys call it, for print
ing. To plagiarize a well-known
expression, "I think that it is a fine
idea."
GALLEY SLAVES
GET A REST
Nearly 80 people who have been |
spending a good share of their re- i
spective times in the business or
editorial offices of The Daily will J
sigh when they glance at today's i
paper. In addition to being the sc_- |
ond largest of the year, it marks the 1
end of a lot of intensive work which
started last October. There will be
a few days necessary ot clean up
the last traces.
Looking back at the ways in j
which some of them have labored, i
I think of Russell Paine, feature 1
editor this term, who worked more '
than 12 hours interviewing profes- |
sors and assistants, writing and re- !
writing and checking facts to de
velop one story which was only
about 300 words long. It was one
of those scientific yarns, which had
to be just so before it could be '
printed.
So you can see why the Daily '
tribe is sighing this morning.
