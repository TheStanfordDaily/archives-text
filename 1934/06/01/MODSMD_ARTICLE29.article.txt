F.R. TRIES
TO SETTLE DIFFERENCES
Now that three major strikes are
in full swing the President is quietly
asking Congress to dust off the
Wagner bill and pass it. You re
member this bill outlawed company
unions and gave the A. F. of L. the
foothold on open shop industries it
had been looking for for years.
As soon as they heard the news
employers screamed with rage and
threatened to ding the whole Re
covery program if the Wagner bill
were passed. The automobile strike
was settled without the help of the
bill, and it was pigeonholed to save
the rest of the New Deal from at
tack.
HEAD-BUSTING GIVES
HIM AN OPPORTUNITY—SO
With the coming of the "head
busting" strikes of the last month,
the President saw a chance to pass
the Wagner bill in modified form.
It has now been re-vamped so as
to rule out only employer-dominat
ed company unions—whatever they
mav be. But the important part of
the bill is the one setting up a Na
tional Industrial Adjustment Board
to settle all strikes—from the bot
tom up, and not from the top down,
as has been the custom.
F. R. thinks he has picked a good
time to get the new Wagner bill
passed. It is not exactly what either
employers or labor unions want but

jit may help settle (he present wave
of strikes before they get to the
j class warfare stage.
HE TRIES TO
AVOID CLASS WARFARE
| This is what everybody wants to
j avoid. Yet the stage is set for an
! outbreak of this kind almost any
i tirr e. Organized labor is fighting
! with dog-like determination for the
J closed shop; organized employers are
i grimly determined that the A. F. of
L. shall not have a monopoly of the
labor market through the closed
shop.
In Toledo, Minneapolis, and San
i Francisco the more radical elements
in both camps want to back up their
determination with violence. If the
strikes are prolonged by the diffi
! culties of settlement, the violent
| elements will gather more and more
| followers, and a class war will be
j in the offing.
j Not only do these strikes offer
I dangerous possibilities, but general
I walkouts in the steel and cotton in
| dustries have been called for the
! next two weeks.
So the President is pushing the
I new Wagner bill in the hope of
| finding something to settle strikes
i with—before things go too far. After
jail it is the sensible way. All strikes
are settled in the end the same way
] in which they could have been set
| tied in the beginning, and generally
|on the same terms offered in the
I beginning.

F.R. TRIES
TO SETTLE DIFFERENCES
Now that three major strikes are
in full swing the President is quietly
asking Congress to dust off the
Wagner bill and pass it. You re
member this bill outlawed company
unions and gave the A. F. of L. the
foothold on open shop industries it
had been looking for for years.
As soon as they heard the news
employers screamed with rage and
threatened to ding the whole Re
covery program if the Wagner bill
were passed. The automobile strike
was settled without the help of the
bill, and it was pigeonholed to save
the rest of the New Deal from at
tack.
HEAD-BUSTING GIVES
HIM AN OPPORTUNITY—SO
With the coming of the "head
busting" strikes of the last month,
the President saw a chance to pass
the Wagner bill in modified form.
It has now been re-vamped so as
to rule out only employer-dominat
ed company unions—whatever they
mav be. But the important part of
the bill is the one setting up a Na
tional Industrial Adjustment Board
to settle all strikes—from the bot
tom up, and not from the top down,
as has been the custom.
F. R. thinks he has picked a good
time to get the new Wagner bill
passed. It is not exactly what either
employers or labor unions want but

jit may help settle (he present wave
of strikes before they get to the
j class warfare stage.
HE TRIES TO
AVOID CLASS WARFARE
| This is what everybody wants to
j avoid. Yet the stage is set for an
! outbreak of this kind almost any
i tirr e. Organized labor is fighting

J closed shop; organized employers are
i grimly determined that the A. F. of
L. shall not have a monopoly of the
labor market through the closed
shop.
