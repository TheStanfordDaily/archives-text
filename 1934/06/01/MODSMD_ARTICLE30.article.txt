AIRLINES—One of the hottest ar
guments of recent months has been
that between exponents of the Brit
ish system of broadcasting and those
who uphold the American system.
English radio stations are all con
trolled by the government, and
every owner of a radio receiver is
taxed approximately $2.50 per year
for the support of these stations.
No advertising is allowed, and that
circumstance is mightily appealing
to the American listener who has
grown tired of long-winded blurbs
in behalf of some product for which
the fan has not the slightest desire.
Excessive advertising IS a legit
imate grievance for the American
listener, but it must be born in mind
that advertising is a necessary evil
if the present high quality of en
tertainment is to be maintained.
Such organizations as the Philadel
phia Symphony Orchestra, and such
artists as Rosa Ponselle, Lawrence
Tibbett, Nino Martini, and others,
would never be heard on the Amer

' ican air if the British system were
installed. would be due to the
expense involved, too great for a
j reasonable tax to support end now
born by the advertisers.
Also, American advertisers are
progressing, slowly but surely, in
: the right direction, and it seems
only a matter of time until radio
(advertising is limited to a very short
portion of the scheduled time on
any particular broadcast. This is
done even now on some of the more
progressive programs, such as (he
one on which Glen Gray and the
Casa Lorna orchestra appear.
