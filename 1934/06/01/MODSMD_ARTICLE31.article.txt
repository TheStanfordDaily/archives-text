# THE 						REVIEWER

THE I ORK IN THE KOAI); With
charity for all and apologies to
none.
At last, dear Public, you and this
Reviewer have come to the fork in
; the road. The time has come when
you must go your way and I must
go mine, apd I'll probably not be
in Scotland before you.
As a matter of fact, perhaps
you've gone your way all along.
I Perhaps I haven't a public after all.
Oh. dear. 11 you have ever read the
Reviewer, if you have ever chuck
led over anything she said, if you
; have ever, by any shift, agreed with
her —please clap your hands! Quick
ly! The voice of the Reviewer is
getting farther and farther away.
Clap your hands, tear your hair,
tango in the aisles!
What? Not a ripple? Ah, well,
I really hadn't any hope.
Wait! There must be some —
i somewhere —because this year the
Reviewer column has at least re
ceived more attention in the Cam
| pus Opinion columns than ever be
fore. Mostly unfavorable, the cries
from all sides have been: too high
i brow, too technical, too hypercrit
ical, too too.
There will always be those lit
eral souls who prefer a good, plain,
i straight-from-the-teeth comment in
J this manner: This movie is LOUSY,"
or "This movie is SWELL."' But I
have been, and am still, under the
illusion that this is not criticism.
Further, I have the impression that
people will go to movies—just as
they go to bed or breakfast—from
habit, regardless of printed opinions.
Believing, then, that critics are to
be read—not agreed with—the Re
viewer has aimed this year at be
j ing consistently readable, and wher
ever possible, entertaining.
Herein have appeared a number
of opinions over this signature, in
! all of which I have presented my
own sincerely considered opinions,
and- with an effort to evaluate hon
| estly the matter at hand. A hyper
critical tendency may be explained
by my belief that most movies are
pretty average, and that it would
! be a pity for anyone to have any
delusions about a film, however en
tertaining it may prove to the per
j son who has just finished an exam,
[ a term paper, or a stout drink.
| At the same time, I have tried to
give credit where credit was due,
1 and to substitute some critical
evaluation for that lazy device,
synopsis, and yet take nothing too
[ seriously.
In short, Lincoln's remark about
all the people all the time likewise
| applies to pleasing them, so the
Reviewer might do just as well by
adhering firmly to a single set of
sincere standards, come what may.
So far, according to report, no meat
has been discovered which is not
l some man's poison.
Meanwhile, Henry Brill, I pass
this little foundling on to your ten
der care with this note pinned to its
blanket, and hie me off • to thai
abode ::o popular at this lime of
year—the Lump-in-Throat Depart
ment.- Elizabeth Chapin.

you must go your way and I must
go mine, apd I'll probably not be
in Scotland before you.

you've gone your way all along.
I Perhaps I haven't a public after all.
Oh. dear. 11 you have ever read the
Reviewer, if you have ever chuck
led over anything she said, if you

her —please clap your hands! Quick

getting farther and farther away.
Clap your hands, tear your hair,
tango in the aisles!
What? Not a ripple? Ah, well,
I really hadn't any hope.
Wait! There must be some —
i somewhere —because this year the
Reviewer column has at least re
ceived more attention in the Cam

fore. Mostly unfavorable, the cries
from all sides have been: too high
