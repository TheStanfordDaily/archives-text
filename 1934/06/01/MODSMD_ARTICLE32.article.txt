## STANFORD GIVES THE WORLD A BREAK 
### 
The Man from Mars: Who are you?
The Stanford Graduate: I've just
i graduated from Stanford; you're the
; man from Mars.
M.F.M.: How'd you know?
S.G.; Everyone else knows me;
. they don't need to ask.
M.F.M.: What is this thing, "Stan
j ford"; how can they tell you've just
| gotten over it. Is it a disease?
S.G.: Stanford is a place something
like Mars; no one is absolutely sure
'■ that it's inhabited by human beings,
i You never get over it.
M.F.M.: Well, what do you mean
J then, when you say you've gradu
ated?
S.G.: That means I'm four years
older than a freshman.
M.F.M.: Is that all?
j S.G.: Well—no. Let's see, that also
makes me three years older than a
| sophomore, two years older than a
i junior, one year above a senior, and
j old enough to join the Kiwanis—or
! maybe even Rotary International.
M.F.M.: What's Kiwanis? What's
j Rotary International?
S.G.: Sic Semper Kiwanis. Down
jjward the college graduate makes his
j way. Do you understand?
i M.F.M.: NO!
J S.G.: Well, all college graduates
have got to join Kiwanis or Rotary.
See, iirst you spend four years in
college, and a lot of guys with bald
heads and gold watches tell you what
life is like; then you join Kiwanis,

and see the world.
M.F.M.: Oh.—Well, do you have
any ideas on life?
S.G.: YES!
M.F.M,: What are they?
S.G.- NO!
M.F.M.: How funny you talk. Well,
what do you think of Socialism?
S.G.: Beyond the point of dimin
ishing returns, returns diminish;
capital is best invested when the law
of equi-marginal potentiality comes
into operation. Yes, and no.
M.F.M.: That's strange. What do
you think of Communism?
S.G.: Returns diminish; that is,
beyond the point of diminishing re
turns. The lav/ of equi-potential
marginality comes into operation
when capital is best invested. No,
and then again, yes.
M.F.M.: Either you're cock-eyed,
or I am.
S.G.: Some say one thing; some
say another.
M.F.M.: Won't you ever learn to
talk sense?
S.G.: That's why I'm joining Ki
wanis.
M.F.M.: Why didn't you go there
in the first place.
