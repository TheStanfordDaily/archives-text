# Cap and Gown Tradition Dates to Medieval Ages
## 
### 
Most of those who graduate from
Stanford—or for that matter any
other university in this country—
grudgingly pay five dollars for the
privilege of wearing caps and gowns
for a single occasion and then never
think of them again.
There is a tradition back of wear
ing these ceremonial robes that
dates back eight centuries, into me
dieval European times. It is one of
the lew traditions to have lasted
down to the present.
Logical in Dark Ages
Many pioneering, radical spirits
in graduating classes today find lit
tle reason for dressing in the som
ber black that is worn. But in the
Dark Aages, ii all seemed logical
enough.
In the first place, most of those
who even looked at a book in the
12th or J .'llll century were clergy
men. Clergymen lived in mone
staries that were anything but
steam heated, with their bare stone
walls. S > copious black robes were
the only protection from the ele
ment:; that gave a dignified appear
ance to the wearers.
As universities began to separate
from the church, this one manner
of dress remained, and the often
spoken-of "town against gown" dis
tinction arose, the gowned scholars
remaining in cloistered seclusion
away from the busy towns.
Hoods Practical
The hoods, also a part of the re
galia of all advanced degrees, had
just, as practical a beginning. Friars
who made their way from town to
town begging for alms had to have
something to put things in, and this

i was the most convenient article of
clothing used for that purpose.
Today the European universities
i follow the old time customs most
j rigorously, although a definite code
' is in effect in this country.
Black gowns, but no hoods, may
ibe worn # by undergraduates, but
I seldom are, except by seniors in
. certain universities. Bachelors of |
j arts may wear black gowns and j
hoods, although hoods are worn in
: few commencement exercises in this ]
j country.
Masters Wear Silk
Candidates for masters' degrees
I wear silk robes, and are given hoods
,at commencement. The hoods are
jof black, lined with the colors of
\ the university, and bordered with
the school in which the candidate
| has taken his work.
Robes for the Doctor's degree are |
j of scarlet in European universities, !
but generally of black or combina
! tions of black and scarlet in this I
j country. They are of silk, with
| black velvet trimmings or velvet of
i the color of the school. Only doc- j
j tors are permitted to wear a gold j
I tassel on their caps.
The first class in this University, j
jin 1891, worp gowns on various
i occasions besides graduation. The !
next classes gave up wearing them
entirely, and none were worn at ,
commencements until after 1900.
-But then the coeds took a hand
;in things and decided that black |
1 gowns were the proper things at i
graduations after all. The Law '
I School agreed, and finally the entire I
j student body, and the costumes
agreed upon are as they appear to
i day.

for a single occasion and then never
think of them again.
There is a tradition back of wear
ing these ceremonial robes that
dates back eight centuries, into me
dieval European times. It is one of
the lew traditions to have lasted
down to the present.
Logical in Dark Ages
Many pioneering, radical spirits
in graduating classes today find lit
tle reason for dressing in the som
ber black that is worn. But in the
Dark Aages, ii all seemed logical
enough.
In the first place, most of those
who even looked at a book in the
12th or J .'llll century were clergy
men. Clergymen lived in mone
staries that were anything but
steam heated, with their bare stone
walls. S > copious black robes were
the only protection from the ele
ment:; that gave a dignified appear
ance to the wearers.
As universities began to separate
from the church, this one manner
of dress remained, and the often
spoken-of "town against gown" dis
tinction arose, the gowned scholars
remaining in cloistered seclusion
away from the busy towns.
Hoods Practical
The hoods, also a part of the re
galia of all advanced degrees, had
just, as practical a beginning. Friars
who made their way from town to
town begging for alms had to have
something to put things in, and this

i was the most convenient article of
clothing used for that purpose.
Today the European universities
i follow the old time customs most
j rigorously, although a definite code
' is in effect in this country.
Black gowns, but no hoods, may
ibe worn # by undergraduates, but
I seldom are, except by seniors in
. certain universities. Bachelors of |
j arts may wear black gowns and j
hoods, although hoods are worn in
: few commencement exercises in this ]
j country.
Masters Wear Silk
Candidates for masters' degrees
I wear silk robes, and are given hoods
,at commencement. The hoods are
jof black, lined with the colors of
\ the university, and bordered with
the school in which the candidate
| has taken his work.
Robes for the Doctor's degree are |
j of scarlet in European universities, !
but generally of black or combina
! tions of black and scarlet in this I
j country. They are of silk, with
| black velvet trimmings or velvet of
i the color of the school. Only doc- j
j tors are permitted to wear a gold j
I tassel on their caps.
The first class in this University, j
jin 1891, worp gowns on various
i occasions besides graduation. The !
next classes gave up wearing them
entirely, and none were worn at ,
commencements until after 1900.
-But then the coeds took a hand
;in things and decided that black |
1 gowns were the proper things at i
graduations after all. The Law '
I School agreed, and finally the entire I
j student body, and the costumes
agreed upon are as they appear to
i day.
Most of those who graduate from
Stanford—or for that matter any
other university in this country—
grudgingly pay five dollars for the
privilege of wearing caps and gowns
for a single occasion and then never
think of them again.
