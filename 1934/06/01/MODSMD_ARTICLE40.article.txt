YOSEMITE, Calif., May 31 (,P).—
A nesting robin calmly disregarded
a fire gong loud enough to awaken
a colony of 1400 persons in Yose
mite National Park and went right
on raising a family, not yet hatched.
The bird's nest is built on top of
the main fire signal. A crew of
workers at Camp Curry watched the
Robin's reactions as the alarm was
tested.
