# Rolph Shows No Gain After Earlier Rally
## Governor Will Not Recover Entirely, Says Doctor 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 31 (/P). —
Governor James Rolph Jr.'s con
dition "shows no improvement," ac
cording to a bulletin issued by his
physicians this evening.
Tihs announcement neutralized the
hopeful news given out earlier in
the day that he had rallied and ap
peared much stronger, even wanting
to get up from the bed to which he
has been confined during the past
month.
But tho cheering signs began to
fade later in the day, and the bul
leti'.', signed oy Dr. Harold Fraser,
Dr. W. W. Weymore, Dr. J. M.
Scanland, and Dr. M. A Danicich
went on to describe his condition:
"Temperature 102, pulse 101, res
piration irregular, restless, weak,
pulmonary connection more marked,
prognosis unfavorable"
Rallies Bad
Commending upon his condition
earlier in the day, Dr. Scanlon de
scribed the governor's illness as such
that short rallies might be expected,
that they were "better, and not so
good," adding in explanation that
"Each time he goes down after a
rally, he loses a little more ground."
While expressing grave doubt as
to whether the governor could hold
out much longer, they all have mar
velled at his remarkable endurance
and indomitable will to live.
Rolph Unsuspecting
"Rolph is apparently unaware of
the fact that he is so near death, but
only knows he is pretty sick," de
clared Dr. John Gallwey, close
friend of the governor for 20 years,
has declared.
Heart stimulants have been used
to keep him alive during the last
night or two, and members of the
family had given up all hope last
night.
Today, however, they seemed more
cheerful, when they realized that he
might live for some time yet. But
they knew that even if he should
recover from this illness, he would
never be the same "Sunny Jim"
again.
Will Be Invalid
His high blood pressure and or
ganic ailments—weakened kidneys,
overworked heart and hardened ar
teries—will make him a very sick
man at best during the rest of his
life.
The relapse which followed the
rally today left everyone in the same
state V>f anxiety as yesterday, and
back to the same uncertainty that
has characterized most statements
from the physicians this week: "It
may be a matter of hours, or days,
or even weeks before the end."
