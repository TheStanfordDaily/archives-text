# PIONEER ROOMS IN STANFORD MUSEUM RECORD EARLY HISTORY OF UNIVERSITY
## 
### 
Relics displayed in the Stanford
Memorial and Early California
rooms of the museum bear mute
witness to may stories and events
connected with the pioneer days
and the founding of Stanford Uni
versity.
Completely filling the center of
the Early California room is the
"Governor Stanford No. 1," first
engine purchased for the Central
Pacific Railroad of which Leland
Stanford was at that time president.
The engine came in parts around
Cape Horn and was assembled in
Sacramento before it was put to
active use. At the time it was added
to the museum the whole back wall
of the room in which it is placed
hod to be removed.
Collections of valuable old im
plements and books used in the
early California missions are placed
in cases around the sides of this
room. Examples of Indian art work
and early paintings are also on dis
play. A hand pumped and pulled
fire engine, purchased by Stanford
for use on his Palo Alto stock farm,
stands near the large engine.
Most outstanding in the Stanford
Memorial room is the large number
of painted portraits on the walls of
the various members of the family.
Several of these are especially val
uable, having been painted by fa
mous artists of that day.
Toys and articles prized by Le
land Stanford, Jr., fill several cases
in this room. His interest in boats
and his adeptness at woodcarving
are emphasized in several very in
teresting collections of his artwork.

I Many of the exhiliits are remi
' niscent of the various activities of
| Leland Stanford as president of the
Central Pacific, Governor of Cali
fornia, and United States Senator.
The golden spike with which he
! completed the first transcontinental
railroad, his senatorial chair, and
, examples of his early experiments
with motion pictures are only a few
i of the more outstanding of these.
The nucleus for the museum was
I the many collections of Leland
I Stanford, Jr., made in this coun
try and on his two European trips.
: The building itself was erected after
the main Quad, and its concrete
I construction was decided upon by
Stanford contrary to the advice of
his friends. The electrical lighting
j system enclosed in the walls was
I wrenched at the time of the earth
quake, and as a result the building
i contains no real lighting system
now.
lii recognizing the value of the
museum and art gallery to the Uni
! versity, Frank DeLemos, acting di
rector of them, has made the follow
| ing statement:
"The Leland Stanford Junior
University Museum and Art Gal
| lery are operated together, the gal
j lery being used for paintings, while
j the museum houses collections of
j good examples of design of, art
| crafts as well as other archaeologi
cal material. The museums and art
! galleries are being considered by
! present day educators as being val
uable in correlation with other
studies of the universities and
'schools."
