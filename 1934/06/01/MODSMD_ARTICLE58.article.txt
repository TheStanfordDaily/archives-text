## Seniors Leave Worldy Goods To Successors 
### 
This is the last will and testament
of the Class of 1934, reposing in I
Stanford University, in and out of |
Santa Clara County, State of Cali
fornia, . . . and from which we now
depart.
It should therefore be respccted,
by Golly.
We declare, moreover, that we are
now to go into a large world to
fleece and to be fleeced. en as we
have been fleeced, and that, there
fore, being in mind sound and al
coholic, and in body, alcoholic and I
sound, rugged individualists all, this
is our last will and our only will, i
and our will forever and ever.
Be it fhen recorded:
We hereby bequeath, devise, and i
assign all those objects, material and ;
spiritual, which we have garnered in
this our last resting place:
To Stanford University, known
also as our Alma Mater, we leave in ;
addition to tuition previously paid,
and a nice fat endowment, the mem- !
ory of our faces, rosy and smiling, !
as we walk from our last final.
To the Board of Trustees, bless all I
15 of them, we bequeath the quar
terly sum of $15, levied upon pos
terity as it was mulcted from us. Be
tween this and Dean Cubbcrley we
hope to see the fame of the School of
Education and of the Stanford-Lane j
Hospital ring through the land. Hear
it ring! Ding. Ding. Ding.
To the Registrar and the Commit- ,
tee on Admissions we leave this I
bitter legacy, the recollection of the !
last selected class. In return we beg
forgiveness that we did not attend
our Saturday 8 o'clocks.
To the "500,"' gone before us, but !
still of us, we leave a single tear,
moist and splashing. To the "800,"
their successors in law and in Defin |
Yost's office, we bequeath the haunt
ing prospect of 1,000 and the 1,200 .
that will follow them. And to the '
fourth generation thereof that is yet ;
to follow, the veil which now covers
Herbie Hoover's Isis in the Art Gal- '
lery.
To the Union Board of Governors |
we leave the quarterly sum of $1 to j
build a sun porch with.
And to the Student Body we be- ;
queath a new Constitution not of our ;
making, an Ex Committee hardly of ;
our choosing, a Daily wholly of our
trading, in the hope that concerning |
these they may have many fine ar- j
guments and over them come to |
many important decisions.
And to the Ex Committee we leave !
the Daily and to'the Daily the Ex
Committee —thinking that, perhaps,
the Daily gets the better of the bar- 1
gain. j
To those who no longer remember j
him, we sadly bequeath the Stan
ford Rougn. To those who still care
we leave his memory and all our
three days' growth of beard, confi
dent that time and the use of these
will accomplish his resurrection.
To Herbert Hoover, '95, we ought .
to leave something. But the Depres
sion Class has very little left.
To the faculty, the student guid
ance committee, the Stanford Cardi
nals, Gordon Davis, and Dean Mary
Yost, we bequeath our blessing and
one cent each. Lest this be taken as
evidence of our animosity we an
nounce this is only because we be- ;
lieve they are well qualified to make !
their own way in the world.
Whatever of dignity, morality, and
sobriety, we may have possessed as I
well as the remainder of our worldly
possessions and fine qualities, wo be
queath to Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur as
residuary legatee. For the whole of
our estate he shall be executor with- t
out bond and without hope, and in
his administration thereof he shall
take guidance from the four figures, 1
Hope, Faith, Charity, and Love, that
are tattooed on the facade of the i
Memorial Church. Let him not harm 1
these for we need them.
And lastly, to those who may care I
for them we leave the moon over the
Memorial Court, the Inner Quad on
a fine, sunny day, and the red roofs
of the University wo saw from the
Hills.
