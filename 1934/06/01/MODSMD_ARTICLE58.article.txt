## Seniors Leave Worldy Goods To Successors 
### 
This is the last will and testament
of the Class of 1934, reposing in
Stanford University, in and out of
Santa Clara County, State of Cali
fornia, . . . and from which we now
depart.
It should therefore be respected,
by Golly.
We declare, moreover, that we are
now to go into a large world to
fleece and to be fleeced, even as we
have been fleeced, and that, there
fore, being in mind sound and al
coholic, and in body, alcoholic and
sound, rugged individualists all, this
is our last will and our only will,
and our will forever and ever.
Be it then recorded:
We hereby bequeath, devise, and
assign all those objects, material and
spiritual, which we have garnered in
this our last resting place:
To Stanford University, known
also as our Alma Mater, we leave in
addition to tuition previously paid,
and a nice fat endowment, the mem-
ory of our faces, rosy and smiling,
as we walk from our last final.
To the Board of Trustees, bless all
15 of them, we bequeath the quar
terly sum of $15, levied upon pos
terity as it was mulcted from us. Be
tween this and Dean Cubberley we
hope to see the fame of the School of
Education and of the Stanford - Lane
Hospital ring through the land. Hear
it ring! Ding. Ding. Ding.
To the Registrar and the Commit-
tee on Admissions we leave this
bitter legacy, the recollection of the
last selected class. In return we beg
forgiveness that we did not attend
our Saturday 8 o'clocks.
To the "500,"' gone before us, but
still of us, we leave a single tear,
moist and splashing. To the "800,"
their successors in law and in Dean
Yost's office, we bequeath the haunt
ing prospect of 1,000 and the 1,200 .
that will follow them. And to the
fourth generation thereof that is yet
to follow, the veil which now covers
Herbie Hoover's Isis in the Art Gal-
lery.
To the Union Board of Governors
we leave the quarterly sum of $1 to
build a sun porch with.
And to the Student Body we be-
queath a new Constitution not of our
making, an Ex Committee hardly of
our choosing, a Daily wholly of our
trading, in the hope that concerning
these they may have many fine ar-
guments and over them come to
many important decisions.
And to the Ex Committee we leave
the Daily and to the Daily the Ex
Committee — thinking that, perhaps,
the Daily gets the better of the bar-
gain.
To those who no longer remember
him, we sadly bequeath the Stan
ford Rough. To those who still care
we leave his memory and all our
three days' growth of beard, confi
dent that time and the use of these
will accomplish his resurrection.
To Herbert Hoover, '95, we ought .
to leave something. But the Depres
sion Class has very little left.
To the faculty, the student guid
ance committee, the Stanford Cardi
nals, Gordon Davis, and Dean Mary
Yost, we bequeath our blessing and
one cent each. Lest this be taken as
evidence of our animosity we an
nounce this is only because we be-
lieve they are well qualified to make
their own way in the world.
Whatever of dignity, morality, and
sobriety, we may have possessed as
well as the remainder of our worldly
possessions and fine qualities, wo be
queath to Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur as
residuary legatee. For the whole of
our estate he shall be executor with-
out bond and without hope, and in
his administration thereof he shall
take guidance from the four figures,
Hope, Faith, Charity, and Love, that
are tattooed on the facade of the
Memorial Church. Let him not harm
these for we need them.
And lastly, to those who may care
for them we leave the moon over the
Memorial Court, the Inner Quad on
a fine, sunny day, and the red roofs
of the University we saw from the
Hills.

are tattooed on the facade of the
Memorial Church. Let him not harm

And lastly, to those who may care

a fine, sunny day, and the red roofs
of the University we saw from the

We, the undersigned, Donn B. Ta
tum, and Dorothy Anne Jackson,
have witnessed the signature of the
above Hal von Breton, testator, and
testify that he was sound, in mind
and body. In fitness thereof we
hereby set our hand and seal on
this the 30th day of May, in the year
of our Lord, one thousand nine hun-
drcd and thirty-four.

This is the last will and testament
of the Class of 1934, reposing in
Stanford University, in and out of
Santa Clara County, State of Cali
fornia, . . . and from which we now
depart.
It should therefore be respected,
by Golly.
We declare, moreover, that we are
now to go into a large world to
fleece and to be fleeced, even as we
have been fleeced, and that, there
fore, being in mind sound and al
coholic, and in body, alcoholic and
sound, rugged individualists all, this
is our last will and our only will,
and our will forever and ever.
Be it then recorded:
We hereby bequeath, devise, and
assign all those objects, material and
spiritual, which we have garnered in
this our last resting place:
To Stanford University, known
also as our Alma Mater, we leave in
addition to tuition previously paid,
and a nice fat endowment, the mem-
ory of our faces, rosy and smiling,
as we walk from our last final.
To the Board of Trustees, bless all
15 of them, we bequeath the quar
terly sum of $15, levied upon pos
terity as it was mulcted from us. Be
tween this and Dean Cubberley we
hope to see the fame of the School of
Education and of the Stanford - Lane
Hospital ring through the land. Hear
it ring! Ding. Ding. Ding.
To the Registrar and the Commit-
tee on Admissions we leave this
bitter legacy, the recollection of the
last selected class. In return we beg
forgiveness that we did not attend
our Saturday 8 o'clocks.
To the "500,"' gone before us, but
still of us, we leave a single tear,
moist and splashing. To the "800,"
their successors in law and in Dean
Yost's office, we bequeath the haunt
ing prospect of 1,000 and the 1,200 .
that will follow them. And to the
fourth generation thereof that is yet
to follow, the veil which now covers
Herbie Hoover's Isis in the Art Gal-
lery.
To the Union Board of Governors
we leave the quarterly sum of $1 to
build a sun porch with.
And to the Student Body we be-
queath a new Constitution not of our
making, an Ex Committee hardly of
our choosing, a Daily wholly of our
trading, in the hope that concerning
these they may have many fine ar-
guments and over them come to
many important decisions.
And to the Ex Committee we leave
the Daily and to the Daily the Ex
Committee — thinking that, perhaps,
the Daily gets the better of the bar-
gain.
To those who no longer remember
him, we sadly bequeath the Stan
ford Rough. To those who still care
we leave his memory and all our
three days' growth of beard, confi
dent that time and the use of these
will accomplish his resurrection.
To Herbert Hoover, '95, we ought .
to leave something. But the Depres
sion Class has very little left.
To the faculty, the student guid
ance committee, the Stanford Cardi
nals, Gordon Davis, and Dean Mary
Yost, we bequeath our blessing and
one cent each. Lest this be taken as
evidence of our animosity we an
nounce this is only because we be-
lieve they are well qualified to make
their own way in the world.
Whatever of dignity, morality, and
sobriety, we may have possessed as
well as the remainder of our worldly
possessions and fine qualities, wo be
queath to Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur as
residuary legatee. For the whole of
our estate he shall be executor with-
out bond and without hope, and in
his administration thereof he shall
take guidance from the four figures,
Hope, Faith, Charity, and Love, that
are tattooed on the facade of the
Memorial Church. Let him not harm
these for we need them.
And lastly, to those who may care
for them we leave the moon over the
Memorial Court, the Inner Quad on
a fine, sunny day, and the red roofs

to leave something. But the Depres
sion Class has very little left.
To the faculty, the student guid
ance committee, the Stanford Cardi
nals, Gordon Davis, and Dean Mary
Yost, we bequeath our blessing and
one cent each. Lest this be taken as
evidence of our animosity we an
nounce this is only because we be-
lieve they are well qualified to make
their own way in the world.
Whatever of dignity, morality, and
sobriety, we may have possessed as
well as the remainder of our worldly
possessions and fine qualities, wo be
queath to Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur as
residuary legatee. For the whole of
our estate he shall be executor with-
out bond and without hope, and in
his administration thereof he shall
take guidance from the four figures,
Hope, Faith, Charity, and Love, that
are tattooed on the facade of the
Memorial Church. Let him not harm
these for we need them.
And lastly, to those who may care
for them we leave the moon over the
Memorial Court, the Inner Quad on
a fine, sunny day, and the red roofs
of the University we saw from the
Hills.
