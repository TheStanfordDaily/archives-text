# First Senior Poem Was Written in '95
## When We Come Back for More 
### CHARLES FIELD, '95 
Note: This is the first senior class poem of Stanford. When the author
wrote it there was only the inner Quad, and the .Chapel had not been built
but there was a site for it. The first class painted its year opposite the future
door of the chapel, and later decided to have the bronze plate for perma
nency. The second verse refers to an old oak tree which the class claimed
for its own and where was placed a bronze tablet with the names of the
class on it.
I wonder when from summer sleep
The old Quad wakes again,
When calling bells their vigil keep
And watch for us in vain,—
Those bells on which we heaped, last year,
Anathamemas galore,
But now are grown so strangely dear
When we come back no more, —
I wonder of among the leaves
A voice will wisper low,
A little dreaming voice that grieves
Over the long ago;
If new-filled places will forget
\ Who loved then best before,
Oh stir a little with regret
That we come back no more.
When underneath the sacred shade
Where shines our name today,
With stranger steps the man and maid
Of '99 shall stray,
Will our old tree, bent down to hear
The same things o'er and o'er,
Forget this is not yester-year
And we come back no more?
Beyond the Palo Alto hills
The days slip stealthily;
The echo of their footsteps fills
The Quad with memory;
There where we made a painted boast,
The chapel site before,
Lies glimmering the twilight ghost
Of what will come no more.
We scatter down the four wide ways,
Clasp hands and part, but keep
The power of the golden days
To lull our care asleep,
And dream, while our new years we fill
With sweetness from those four,
That we are known and loved there still
Though we come back no more.
