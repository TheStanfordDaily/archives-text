ring to accommodate spectators.
Campus horse lovers are promised
an excellent demonstration of
horsemanship skill at today's event,
according to Hill lineniark, chair
man of the committee on arrange
ments, as preliminary judging has
already been run off to eliminate
poor perl'orniances.
Sponsored by Society
The show is presented annually
by Scabbard and Hlade, national
honorary military society, iu con
junction with the local military
'department. Six events are offered,

advanced course military students
and the other for basic course men.

horsemanship, the winners of which
events Captain Gordan refused to
predict. Any one of the entrants in
the advanced class may win the
event, he stated. He emphasized
the element of luck attending such
a competition. However, with such
riders as Hob Fullerton, Muss Has
mussen, l.uppc l.uppeu, and others
entered, this advanced event looms
as one of the most interesting on

formances assured. The basic event
will be equally close, Captain Gor
