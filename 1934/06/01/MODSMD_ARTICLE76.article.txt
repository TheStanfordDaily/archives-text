GREAT SEASON
FADING OUT
In iny own term of office we have
watched a season of great perform
ances slip by. On the track begin
ning with the all-l'niversily meet,
which raised some of the funds to
send the learn to Ihe 1.C.4-A., Wal
ter Marly leaped higher than any
one but himself had ever gone and
then returned to Angcll Field a few
weeks later with the Fresno Stale
team lo set up a new'world's rec
ord. The same day Ihe only blot on
Ihe season occurred when Captain
(ius Meier, falling over a hurdle,
received I lie unfortunate injury
which shelved him for the year.
The week previously Stanford
trimmed Ihe Hears for the eleventh
consecutive time, and John Lyman
astounded the world with a heave
of 54 feet I inch in Ihe shot-put,
only to see it wiped out by Jack
Torrance a week later with a loss
of over 55 feet. 1
The Cards, without Meier, put up
a losing battle against F.S.C., but
after considerations and reconsid
erations by the H.A.C.,' seven stars
journeyed to Philadelphia for Ihe
1.C.4-A. and soundly trounced the
forces of the Fast. Now "The Sev
en," along with some of (heir team
mates, are preparing to end Ihe
season with the N.C.A.A. meet in
Los Angeles June 22 and 2!l.
OTHER EVENTS
OF THE SEASON
We also watched a great water
polo team go through a highly suc
cessful season, placing themselves
as the premier college team on the

I Coast, bowing only to the Los An-|
, geles Athletic Club.
Captain Hichard A. Gordan, in'
his final year at Stanford, put the I
best collegiate polo team in the'
j West on the field and watched il
sail through all opposition. Cap
fain Gordon's loss is a great one to
â€¢ Stanford polo.
The baseball and tennis teams,
not as successful as their 1 brethren.
I worried through in-and-out sea
sons, bill with great material re
turning for next year, should find
themselves at the top of tile heap
in 1i),'15. j
FIRST ALL-SPORTS
DECATHLON GOES OVER
lu the field of intramural ath
letics we saw Ihe first All-Sports
Decathlon go over successfully.
Considerable interest was aroused 1
and next year's competition, with
some of the mistakes made this'
year eradicated, should be one of!
j the outstanding events of the spring i
' sport season.
Too much credit cannot be given
to Marvie Kahn, who directed the
Decathlon, nor to Coaches John
Hunn, Myron Sprague, Mill tilling-:
lon, and Norl Thornton, who aided
iu running il off. Credit is also due
I the coaches and members of the j
athletic faculty who donated the j
permanent individual trophy. Those
men were "Husky" Hunt, John
Hunn, Myron Sprague, lirnic N'ev- 1
i crs, Harry Maloncy. Nort Thornton,
Harry Woller, "TijiV' Thornhill,
lilvvyn Hugge, Hill lilli ngton, .lini
Lawson, "Habhit" Mradshaw, Don
Leibendorfcr, Dr. Thomas A. Storey, j
and AI Masters. I
