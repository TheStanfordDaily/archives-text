# DISPUTED BATTLE OF JUTLAND TERMED TECHNICAL GERMAN TRIUMPH BY SOKOL
## 
### 
Eighteen years ago, the last
echoes of the great naval battle of
Jutland were just dying away.
Dr. Anthony C. Sokol, of the
Stanford Germanic Languages De
partment, was an officer of the High
Command in the Imperial Royal
Austro-Hungarian Navy. He served
along with Admiral Horthy de
Nagybanya, present Regent of Hun
gary, on the "Prihz fiugen."
Dr. Sokol, who published a de
tailed study of the battle, the vic
tor of which has been much de
bated, believes the encounter repre
sents a technical German naval
triumph over the British fleet.
Sokol points out that with a forcc
two-thirds the size of the British,

. a German fleet sunk twice as much
enemy tonnage as the British. Sokol
further contends that in naval strat
egy and tactics, the Germans out
maneouvered the British.
Although the battle of Jutland
was indecisive due to weather con
ditions, the German high seas fleet
failed in its objective of breaking
British supremacy on the sea, says
Sokol.
Great Britain retained command
of the seas, but after destroying
Germany, found a more powerful
competitor in the United States.
"A decisive German or British
naval victory at Jutland, May 31,
1916, would have decided the war
j immediately," concludes Dr. Sokol.
