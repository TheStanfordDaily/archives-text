# Rothert Explains Work Of Alumni Association
## 
### HARLOW P. ROTHERT, Alumni Secretary 
After Senior Week activities are
over, students who are depaiting
from the University need not feel
they will no longer be an active
part of Stanford life. The Alumni
Association, which will be your own
organization from now on, makes
possible your continued activity in
Stanford affairs and enables you to
keep in touch with all phases of
Stanford's educational program.
Thousands of alumni already par
ticipate in our many local Stanford
Club meetings all over the country
and even abroad. They receive last
minute, accurate information about
developments here on the Farm and
reports and stories from our leaders
in every line of activity in the
"Stanford Illustrated Review," pub
lished 10 months each year. They
receive representation on the Alumni
Council of 16 members which di
rects alumni policies. Incidentally,
your own class is fortunate to be rep
resented by Art Azevedo, who will
undoubtedly contribute enthusias
tically to the work of the Council
for the next three years.
The Alumni Association mem
bers also have built up a fine
scholarship program which pro
vides about 15 tuition scholarships
each year to worthy entering stu
dents, retaining full control of the
granting of these awards. Bear in
mind, too, that the days of student
tickets to all the football games
are over. However, ticket appli
cations from active members of
the Association arc given prefer
ence over the rest of the alumni
and general public in all impor
tant games.
Many other events are held each
year designed to meet the wishes of
our alumni. The alumni conferences
in Los Angeles and on the campus,
attended by hundreds of Stanford
men and women, enable them to con
tinue their study of current eco
nomic, political, and social problems
with the leading thinkers of our
well-trained faculty. You may not
yet realize it, but acquiring an edu
cation is a life-long task.
Each year University Day, the
alumni homecoming, provides a
week-end of fine entertainment back

on tho Farm with many of your
"old" classmates and with certain
designated classes holding special
gatherings. The first special reunion
of your class will be in the spring
of 1939.
The Alumni Association office in
the Administration Building will
he your headquarters. Here the
addresses, files, and biographical
data of every man or woman who
ever attended Stanford arc kept
available for you. Here a stall of
men and women are constantly at
your service, ready to co-operate
in any possible way and to help
you express your interest in our
beloved institution. The alumni
office is available to everyone,
whether he is a member of the
Alumni Association or not. How
ever, membership is required to
entitle one to receive the "Illus
trated Review," preferred classifi
cation in football tickcts and par
ticipation in the alumni scholarship
program.
Annual dues of the Association are
$4, payable every summer at this
timÂ», or by installments of only $1
per quarter. Or better still, by se
curing a life membership by pay
ment of $50 in cash or five payments
of $10 per year, plus interest, one is
entitled to all Stanford alumni priv
ileges and participation for the rest
of his life. As a special limited offer
this year, we will present one copy
of the 1934 Quad to every senior
who takes out a life membership in
the Alumni Association before July
Ist.
We need not remind you how fool
ish it would be to allow your fine
Stanford contacts to die away. Be
proud of the fact that you are Stan
ford men and women. The Stanford
Alumni Association cordially invites
you to join this common effort which
is inspired by our love for the insti
tution and respect for her ideals.
