### 
Donn Ttaum, senior class president
and chairman of the interfraternity
Council, last night issued the fol
lowing statement to senior classmen,
urging them to take part in the Sen
ior Week activities which begin a
week from Wednesday.
"In a very few days, we, the class
of 1934, shall join the masses of
160,000 college men and women
graduating this Spring. Our ideas

and modes of living will necessarily
undergo great changcs. We shall
possibly look back with longing upon
these college days.
"Before Commencement Day, hov
ever, we shall have a last chance to
say farewell to Stanford. The activi
of Senior Week offer an opportunity
to enjoy, together, the last hours of
undergraduate life. By wholeheart
edly entering into those activities,
we shall carry away a very happy
impression of our days here at Stan
ford.
"It is my hope that our paths in
after life will cross many times;
and that through the Alumni Asso
ciation and the regular five-year
class reunions, we shall often have
occasion to actively recall the won
derful four-year period just ending."
Sincerely,
Don Tatum,
President, Class '34
