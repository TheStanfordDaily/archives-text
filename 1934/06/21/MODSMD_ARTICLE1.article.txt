# Stanford Seven Seeks Title at National Meet
## Victors in I.C.4-A. Meet To Compete This Week In South Louisiana State and Trojans Are Barriers 
### Millard Browne 
Stanford's sturdy seven, a by-word
among track fans this season, will seek
their second national track and field
championship of the 1934 season tomor
row and Saturday at the National Col
legiate Athletic Association in Los An
geles, when they match their talents in
10 events with 300 of the best collegiate
talent in the country.
Remaining on the campus barely long
enough to take final examinations fol
lowing a smashing victory in the 58th
annual 1.C.4-A. meet in Philadelphia
last month, the Indian troupe embarked
last week for the southland and the
N.C.A.A.
The seven Cardinal stars, John Ly
man, John Mottram, Gordon Dunn, A1
Blackman, Sam Klopstock, Chuck Nim
mo, and Bud Deacon, comprise the en
tire Stanford representation in the meet.
Board of Athletic Control officials had
previously considered supplementing
this group with several other members
of the squad.
Louisiana's Sextet
On the eastern sojourn, it was a case
of Stanford's few stars triumphing over
Yale's many entries for first place. At
Los Angeles, however, some of the chief
Card rivalry will come from an even
smaller band of six Louisiana State
stars. A sextet from this school won
last year's N.C.A.A. in Chicago, upset
ting the mighty Troy.
Southern California will be another
barrier to Cardinal championship hopes.
Stanford met neither of these schools
in the 1.C.4-A. The Trojans, have al
ready demonstrated strength by defeat
ing Coach Dink Templeton's team in a
dual meet.
Torrance's Challenge
Lyman and Dunn, who had little
trouble in placing one-two in both
weights at Philadelphia, will rim up
against Jack Torrance of Louisiana, who
has placed the shot 56 feet 5 inches, and
has a record of 55 feet 1% inches pend
ing acceptance. Lyman added a foot
to the established world's record but
still fell one foot short of Torrance's
throw.
A certain Glenn Hardin of Louisiana
will cause both Blackman and Klop
stock plenty of trouble. Hardin is cred
ited with the fastest quarter mile in
the country this year, and is also one
of the nation's best low hurdlers. Black
man triumphed in the 400-meters, and
Klopstock won the low barrier event
in the 1.C.4-A., but Hardin was not in
this meet.
Chances for Points
Mottram, still considered one of the
best javelin throwers in the country,
may come through with a victory, Klop
stock is rated a good chance of placing
well in the high hurdles, and Dunn may
defeat Torrance in the discuss for
enough points to place the Indians in
front.
