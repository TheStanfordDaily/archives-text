# Stanford Is Not Heaven
## 
### 
Stanford is a pleasant place in the summer. Classrooms are not crowded
and life is leisurely. Under the arcades of the Quad it is quiet and restful.
An almost deserted library invites the student to uninterrupted hours of
peaceful reading. The glistening swimming pools entice him into their
cooling depths. The golf course is an oasis of green set in the brown hills
that catch the sunset glow. There is warmth in the fields and shade under
the oaks.
These attractions contribute to the value of a summer at Stanford but
they are a source of danger. They may act as a stimulant but they may
also act as a soporific.
In such surroundings reality seldom rears its ugly head. It is easy to
forget that on all sides trouble is fermenting in the orchards and the fields
and the vineyards. The longshoremen's strike is affecting the daily lives of
thousands up and down the coast, but it would be possible to laze along at
Stanford without giving it a thought. California is facing a scramble for
the governorship but Stanford officially and deliberately avoids taking any
part in politics. Outside the gates of the campus, jobless men and women
are treading the highways, but that is outside the gates. There are poverty
and oppression, crime and violence, apathy and hysteria abroad, even
though they may not be felt under the red-tiled roofs and behind the sand
stone walls.
It is conceivable that some professors in their ivory towers may choose
to pass these things by and drone on about abstractions and the glories of
the past. It is possible that some students may find at Stanford a haven
from the turmoil of the outer world and choose to shut their eyes to the
events that are happening and failing to happen. Such a course can only
make the delayed realization of things as they are the more difficult to face.
The summer student body is somewhat different in its composition
from that of other seasons. Although the year-round college student of
these days does not fit patly into the traditional characterization of care
free irresponsibility, the boy or girl newly out of high school can perhaps
be indulged some indifference to a world which has not yet confronted him
with a personal challenge. But older students returning for added knowl
edge, teachers, seekers after higher degrees, have already accepted a cer
tain responsibility. Stanford has much to give them but they have much
to give Stanford. They can look beyond the edges of the campus and
into their own experience and inject into the smug security of a cloistered
educational retreat some recognition of the need for helping a troubled
world out of its chaos. They may not find the answer, but awareness is
the first step.
They cannot do this if they regard the idyllic atmosphere in which they
are working and playing as typical or as the Utopian reward set aside for
a chosen few.
