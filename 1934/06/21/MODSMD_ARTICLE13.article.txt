# Poliomyelitis Precaution
## 
### 
Although there is no present cause for alarm at Stanford or in the
vicinity, reports of spreading poliomyelitis in other parts of the state find
the University health control prepared.
Co-operating with Dr. Thomas Storey, general director of the School
of Hygiene and Physical Education, a group of Palo Alto physicians has
worked out a program of prevention. Blood for serum for prophylactic
purposes for children and contact cases is being supplied at no cost and
the serum will be available if the need arises. Stanford's seven track men,
now at Los Angeles, underwent inoculation before their departure.
Poliomyelitis, better known by the misnomer, infantile paralysis, has
caused previous scares here and elsewhere, sometimes with justification.
The seriousness of the disease and its consequences cannot be discounted.
But a recapitulation of the activities and vigilance of the student health
services ought to be a source of reassurance and a check to any unwar
ranted fears.
It is the aim of the services "to make accurate, dependable, thorough
health examination of students; to give sound advice and instruction con
cerning physical or mental health and social adjustment; to give first-class
safeguarded professional office treatment for the care of complaints of
temporary ambulatory cases ; to guide the student facing the
probability of serious illness to the professional medical service of his
choice and to appropriate hospitilization."
This is not a special emergency service but a continuing aid to the stu
dent. A ready ear greets any complaint which is made at the gymnasium
offices. Students can save themselves from any undue alarm and help
uphold Stanford's reputation as a healthy spot, physically as well as men
tally, by taking advantage of the service and facilities.
