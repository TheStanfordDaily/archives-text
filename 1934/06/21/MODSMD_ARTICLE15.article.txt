# WHY IT'S NEWS
## The 						Strike Goes On 
### CROMPTON BANGS Jr 
THE "WE'RE GETTING
SICK OF IT" STAGE
Last Saturday the prolonged long
shoremen's strike came very close to
settlement. Strike leaders made their
peace with the employers; everybody
felt cheered up and had visions of busi
ness along normal lines after the week
end. They were disappointed. The rank
and file of the strikers rejected the deal
made by their leaders, claiming they
had sold them out to the employers. So
the strike went on.
The longer strikes last the sharper
become the tempers on both sides.
Everything considered, there has been
remarkably little violence in a dispute
involving 25,000 men and tying up Pa
cific Coast Shipping. This is because for
over six weeks police, strikers, and em
ployers have been reasonably careful
about stepping on each other's toes.
Finally, Portland and Los Angeles may
ors, reacting to ceaseless prodding by
shippers, have threatened to break the
strike by force. They said they were
getting sick of the apparently leaderless
unions.
NEITHER SIDE CAN
GET ALL IT WANTS
Throughout the strike the longshore
men have resolutely demanded the
closed shop (only union men hired),
joint control of the hiring halls, higher
wages, and more equal division of avail

able work. The employers were equally
determined that the strikers should not
get these things. The supposed peace
favored the shippers and left the specific
demands of the strikers to future settle
ment.
In peaceful arbitration, as in violent
war, the stronger side wins. In this
case the employers were stronger, so
they won—for the time being at least.
Riled by the flat refusal of the long
shoremen to abide by their leaders'
agreement, some employers want to
turn from the peaceful means to the
violent and make the men go back to
work. In any show of force the em
ployers, with the help of police, special
deputies, and national guard, would
again be the stronger—after consider
able bloodshed.
BUT THE TROUBLE
WILL STILL BE THERE
While an armed steam roller may
crush the longshoremen for the time
being, a great deal of bitterness will re
main, leaving the beaten men easy prey
to Communist organizers—which is just
what the employers want to avoid. By
busting the strike they would only play
right into the hands of the Reds.
In the end most strikes are settled in
the way they could have been settled in
the beginning. Usually the terms are
the same. Of course this strike has been
going for over six weeks, but there is
still time to meet the longshoremen's
demands half-way. Then bitterness and
possibly another strike could be avoided.
