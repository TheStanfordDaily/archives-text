# Dr. Wilbur Tells Opportunity For Closer Contacts

### 
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, president of
the University, today issued the follow
ing message of welcome to summer
quarter students:
Stanford's summer quarter has a
life all its own. The University
shrinks in size. The faculty and
students come closer together and

concentrate on intellectual work
and social interests. The so-called
"student activities" are replaced by
the use of the swimming pools,
tennis and handball courts, and the
golf course.
We are glad to welcome all new
comers to our campus, as well as
to greet those students who are re
turning from previous summers.
We think our summer climate and
our life here is a real experience.
We hope that you will get the Stan
ford habit and return again and
again, until this choice part of the
world will be your second home.
