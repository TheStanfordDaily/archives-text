# Correct Summer Address Is Desired By Postoffice
## 
### 
Summer students and faculty can do
much to avoid delays in the delivery
of their mail by notifying the post
office promptly of their correct ad
dresses. A card index is maintained in
the office to speed up the identification
of campus residents and the authorities
wish to have this file complete as soon
as possible.
Postoffice boxes are available for
those who desire them. Carrier deliv
ery on the campus is available, except
at the dormitories. Special care should
be taken to warn all correspondents
that the University address is Stan
ford University, California. Letters ad
dressed to the Palo Alto office are nec
essarily delayed.
