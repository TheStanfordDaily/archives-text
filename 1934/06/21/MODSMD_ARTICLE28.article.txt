# TUESDAY PROGRAM TO BE OPENED BY NOTED POET-CRITIC
## Weekly Entertainments Will Present Attractions Of Varied Type 
### 
The English poet and critic, Edward
Davidson, will open the annual summer
quarter entertainment series, to be pre
sented this year each Tuesday evening
beginning next week. With one excep
tion, these programs will be held in the
dance studio of the Women's gymna
sium, at 8 o'clock.
Mr. Davidson's lectui'e will be "The
Approach to Poetry" and will be fol
lowed by a recital from his own poems.
Wednesday afternoon, June 27, he will
give a second lecture in the Little Thea
tre at 4:15 o'clock on "Poetry in Our
Time."
Enlisting in the English army at the
outbreak of the war when only sixteen,
he was an officer in the Naval Intelli
gence Service at demobilization and
already a well-known poet. He has
been on the staff at Vassar College and
on the editorial staff of the Saturday
Review of Literature.
Perry Dilley's Puppets will give a
modern version of "Cinderella" in the
Union Court as the second perform
ance on the Tuesday series. This well
known authority on puppetry will offer
a three-act play, using fifteen mario
nettes. The plot adheres to the old tale
but characterizations are distinctly con
temporary and original.
Other entertainment will be offered
each Tuesday during the summer ses
sion ending Tuesday, August 21, with
a lecture by Dr. P. A. Wadia, native of
India, and dean of the Faculty of Arts
at the University of Bombay on "Re
ligion and Politics," covering the expe
riment in India of the last three years.
