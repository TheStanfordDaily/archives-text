# School Parleys Start Monday
## 
### 
With five hundred administrators,
supervisors, teachers, and other edu
cational specialists already enrolled,
the Stanford University Conference on
Curriculum and Instruction is ready to
begin Monday morning.
Pointing out the appropriateness of
such a conference at this time, the pre
liminary statement of purpose, as re
leased by the School of Education,
reads: "It is probable that the program
of schools has never been subjected to
such rigorous examination as during re
cent years. Extensive social changes
have set a somewhat new task for the
schools. New students are being served
and their needs are somewhat differ
ent. New developments in psychology
throw new light on the educational
problems with which we are dealing.
Progressive administrators and teachers
are seeking improved curriculum ma
terials and instructional processes. Op
portunity will be offered in the six-day
conference to become informed about
developments elsewhere, to present
your own thinking for examination,
and to acquaint yourself with social and
psychological developments that affect
the educational program."
Two quarter-units may be earned by
those who attend the six-day session
and study the assignments offered to
supplement the meetings. Women mem
bers will be housed in Roble Hall, while
Toyon Hall will be available to the men
in attendance.
For the purpose of examining the
program of the entire school, the con
ference will be divided into the follow
ing groups: Superintendents of schools;
secondary-school administrators; ele
mentary - school administrators and
general supervisors; kindergarten and
primary teachers; intermediate ele
mentary teachers; and secondary school
groups on the subject of English, speech,
social studies, science, mathematics, for
eign languages, art, music, physical
education, commerce, home economics,
and industrial arts.

Students who pian to earn part or all
of their expenses during the summer
quarter should arrange for a personal
interview with the appointment service.
