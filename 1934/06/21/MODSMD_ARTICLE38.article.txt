# NOTED COMPOSER TO GIVE COURSES IN WORLD MUSIC
## University Will Be First In Interpretation Of Oriental Tunes 
### 
Henry Cowell, well-known musician,
composer, and lecturer will offer sum
mer courses in Music Systems of the
World, and Appreciation of Modern
Music.
Cowell, who is the composer of nu
merous piano and or
chestra, and author of "American Com
posers on American Music: A Sympo
sium," has given lecture-recitals for the
leading conservatories and institutes of
music and art, both in this country and
abroad. His courses are intended not
for the professional or would-be per
former, but rather for the audience of
the future that they may find in thor
oughly-grounded musical understand
ing another means of appreciating the
work of the masters; and that in the
universality of music they will better
understand all people and races.
Stanford will be the first University
to interpret Oriental music and will
share only with Yale the study of prim
itive music. Mr. Cowell has collected
recordings from all over the world to
illustrate his lectures.
Warren D. Allen, University organist
and lecturer in music, will give Musi
cal Fundamentals during summer ses
sion, and will also lecture on Beethoven
and Bach, a course planned in connec
tion with the Beethoven Cycle to be
presented by the Pro Art Quartet
through the gift of Mrs. Elizabeth
Sprague Coolidge. University instruc
tion and credit is also offered for work
with the choir of the University Church.
