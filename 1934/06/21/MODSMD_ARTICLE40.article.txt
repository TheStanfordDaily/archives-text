# University Seeks Ruling On Liquor Sale Permits
## 
### 
With a view to obtaining a final and
binding interpretation of the penal
code ruling which prevents the sale
of liquor within a mile and a half of
the University, attorneys for Stanford
yesterday filed petition for a writ of
certiorari with the state supreme court.
The petition seeks a review of the
decision of the state board of equaliza
tion which granted liquor dispensing
permits to places of business in Menlo
Park and May field with the explana
tion that the specified mile and a half
should be measured from the main ad
ministration buildings of Stanford
rather than from the outer edges of
the campus.
Trial of Stanley Bishop, proprietor
of the California Avenue Pharmacy
in Mayfield, which had been sched
uled for this morning, was dismissed
by Judge John E. Springer of Palo
Alto pending the supreme court's de
cision on the validity of the board of
equalization action. Bishop brought
the permits to a test when he displayed
intoxicants for sale in his store.
