# Director Mears' Welcome Points To Friendliness
## 
### 
In welcoming the students who will
be with us this summer, I want to stress
particularly the atmosphere of friend
liness prevailing on our campus. The
unique advantages which Stanford pre
sents throughout the year as a resi
dence university are intensified in the
summer; a smaller student body, and

the inaction of the more formal or
ganizations have the merit of bringing
the members of the community more
closely together. It is the desire of the
members of the regular staff who re
main on duty, and I believe that I may
speak also for those students who are
continuing on from the spring quarter,
to welcome the newcomers sincerely
and heartily, and make them feel that
they are among friends. With this spirit
prevailing, even the intensive study
which courses require will not be found
irksome, and it is hoped that everyone
will utilize the opportunities for recre
ation which the University has pro
vided.
The program of public exercises and
entertainment this summer is of dis
tinctive worth. The usual place of meet
ing is the delightful setting afforded by
the Women's Gymnasium. In addition
to the Tuesday evening series of lec
tures and entertainments of more gen
eral interest, there will be lectures on
Thursday evenings. Through the gen
erous gift of Mrs. Elizabeth Sprague
Coolidge, students will have the privi
lege of attending without charge the
series of six concerts to be given on
Friday afternoons, by the Pro Arte
Quartet of Brussels. Organ recitals in
the Memorial Church will be given on
Thursday afternoon and Sunday eve
ning. Students will be granted a spe
cial course or single ticket rate for the
famous orchestra concerts, held on al
ternate Sunday afternoons during July
and August, in the Woodland Theater
at Hillsborough.
An English ballad opera of the eight
eenth century, "Love in a Village," will
be presented on Friday evening, July 6.
An unusually interesting play, to be
given by University students, is sched
uled for Friday evening, August 3. To
keep posted regarding these and other
lectures and entertainments, you should
consult the University Weekly Calendar
and the Stanford Daily, which will be
issued on Tuesdays and Thursdays
throughout the quarter.
With an academic program of un
usual breadth and value, a faculty of
leading members of the regular staff
and visitors of outstanding ability, un
rivaled opportunities for outdoor recre
ation, and an atmosphere of genuine
friendliness, I trust that each and every
student will find real enjoyment and
profit in attending this 1934 summer
quarter at Stanford University.

they are among friends. With this spirit
prevailing, even the intensive study
which courses require will not be found
irksome, and it is hoped that everyone
will utilize the opportunities for recre
ation which the University has pro
vided.
The program of public exercises and
entertainment this summer is of dis
tinctive worth. The usual place of meet
ing is the delightful setting afforded by
the Women's Gymnasium. In addition
to the Tuesday evening series of lec
tures and entertainments of more gen
eral interest, there will be lectures on
Thursday evenings. Through the gen
erous gift of Mrs. Elizabeth Sprague
Coolidge, students will have the privi
lege of attending without charge the
series of six concerts to be given on
Friday afternoons, by the Pro Arte
Quartet of Brussels. Organ recitals in
the Memorial Church will be given on
Thursday afternoon and Sunday eve
ning. Students will be granted a spe
cial course or single ticket rate for the
famous orchestra concerts, held on al
ternate Sunday afternoons during July
and August, in the Woodland Theater
at Hillsborough.
An English ballad opera of the eight
eenth century, "Love in a Village," will
be presented on Friday evening, July 6.
An unusually interesting play, to be
given by University students, is sched
uled for Friday evening, August 3. To
keep posted regarding these and other
lectures and entertainments, you should
consult the University Weekly Calendar
and the Stanford Daily, which will be
issued on Tuesdays and Thursdays
throughout the quarter.
With an academic program of un
usual breadth and value, a faculty of
leading members of the regular staff
and visitors of outstanding ability, un
rivaled opportunities for outdoor recre
ation, and an atmosphere of genuine
friendliness, I trust that each and every
student will find real enjoyment and
profit in attending this 1934 summer
quarter at Stanford University.

In welcoming the students who will
be with us this summer, I want to stress
particularly the atmosphere of friend
liness prevailing on our campus. The
unique advantages which Stanford pre
sents throughout the year as a resi
dence university are intensified in the
summer; a smaller student body, and

the inaction of the more formal or
ganizations have the merit of bringing
the members of the community more
closely together. It is the desire of the
members of the regular staff who re
main on duty, and I believe that I may
speak also for those students who are
continuing on from the spring quarter,
to welcome the newcomers sincerely
and heartily, and make them feel that
they are among friends. With this spirit
prevailing, even the intensive study
which courses require will not be found
irksome, and it is hoped that everyone
will utilize the opportunities for recre
ation which the University has pro
vided.
