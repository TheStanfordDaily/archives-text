are several mature parts which he
would like to see filled by older persons.

ker, the title part;.. Elaine Harker,

ten; undertaker's assistants, and a

lives, as manifested by the popular ap

also believes that the fact that Stanford
has one of the best schools of medicine
in the country will add to the impor
tance of the production here.
