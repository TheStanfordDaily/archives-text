# Warning of Fire Hazard Issued by Chief Dugan
## 
### 
Chief Robert E. Dugan of the Stan
j ford Fire Department today issued
1 warnings to everyone on the campus to
' be particularly careful with matches
' and cigarettes during the current dry
I spell. Due to the fact that the campus
i is covered with a heavy growth of last
j year's grass which through lack of
| moisture has become extremely in
i flammable, students are further warned
j that on the Fourth of July there will
| be no fireworks allowed on the campus
except in the dry bed of Lagunita.
Sunday afternoon the Fire Dcpart-
I ment was twice called to extinguish
! small grass fires in the southern por
i tion of the campus. Fortunately these
! were caught before they had had op
portunity to spread.
Occasional gusts of wind and the
] continued lack of rain have made the
Farm a potential tinder box, and al
! though Chief Dugan and his men are
j doing all they can to reduce the danger
:of conflagration, nevertheless the co-
I operation of everyone on the campus
; is necessary in order that these fires be
i kept to a minimum.
