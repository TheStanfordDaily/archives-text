# N.C.A.A. Victory Gives Stanford High Track Honors
## 
### John H. Gill 
Stanford track men climaxed one of
the most successful seasons in the his
tory of the University when they scored
a smashing triumph in the annual
N.C.A.A. track meet in Los Angeles Sat
urday. Trouncing the University of
Southern California and Louisiana
State University, Iheir two closest ri
vals, by scoring 63 points, the Indians
reached a position seldom attained by
any college—that of winning both the
1.C.4-A. and the N.C.2-A. in the same
season.
The biggest surprise was the come
through performance of little Jimmy
Willson, the hard-luck kid, who, after
suffering injuries all through his col
lege career, finally showed how good
a sprinter he really is by scoring eight
points in the 100 and 220-yard dashes
and providing Stanford's edge of vie

| tory. In accomplishing this, he defeated J
' Foy Draper of U.S.C., who held two j
I decisions over the Stanford sprinter
earlier in the season. Not good enough
| to place in some of the earlier season |
i meets, he worked himself into condition !
I and showed his heels to some of the |
country's fastest sprinters.
All came through in great style after i
suffering some heart-breaking setbacks j
in the preliminary trials. Johnnie Mot- ,
tram took second in the javelin throw j
with a toss of 216 feet sVis inches. Bud
Deacon recovered from a mid-season j
slump to capture second place in the
( pole vault with a jump of 13 feet 9
inches.
Stanford's great weight duo got to
j gether to score 24 points. Johnnie Ly- j
| man took second to Louisiana's man- i
mountain Jack Torrance with a good .
j throw of 53 feet 7'. i inches in the shot •

put and third in the discus at 155 feet I
inch. Gordon Dunn took fourth in
the shot at 52 feel I' i inches and first
in the discus with a mighty toss of
162 feet 7 inches. Sam Klopstock, elim
inated from his specialty, the low hur
dles, came back to take a first place in
the high barriers and beat out Fisher
of L.S.U. in the fast time of 14.4 sec
onds. Little Chuck Nimmo proved him
self among the best milers in the coun
try by placing sixth in that event and
adding one point to the Stanford total.
The N.C.A.A. meet concluded the offi
cial track season for the Stanford ath
letes, but some of them will carry on
this week-end with the Olympic Club
of San Francisco in the National A.A.U.
meet at Milwaukee. This moot saw the
last appearance under tho Stanford
banner of Lyman, Dunn, Wilson, and
Deacon.
