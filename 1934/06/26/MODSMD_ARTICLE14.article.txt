# Faults Cited In Education By Kefauver
## Stanford Dean Opens Six-Day Conference on Problems of Curriculum Change Dr. Paul Hanna of Columbia Speaks in Evening 
### 
Talks by Dnan Grayson N. Kefauver
and Dr. John C. Almack of the Stan
ford School of Education on some of
the problems now facing educators in
the United States opened the six-day
Conference on Curriculum and Instruc
tion which began here yesterday after
noon.
Several hundred school administra
tors and teachers have enrolled for the
conference, which is being sponsored
by the School of Education and which
will continue until June 30. Summer
quarter students may attend the con
ference without charge and may, by
enrolling for Education 235, receive two
units of credit.
Dean Kefauver's talk, "Criticisms of
Curriculum and Instruction," dealt
with current criticisms of established
programs in the schools. Some of these
problems, Kefauver declared, are that
the present curriculum does not ade
quately x-ecognize major social trends
and problems, that the curriculum bears
too little relationship to the life of the
student outside of school, and that the
formal program of schools is too rigid.
"A Long-Range View of the Curricu
lum" was the title of Dr. Almack's dis
cussion. He pointed out • that educa
tional objectives and programs have
appeared in cycles and have, in the
main, reflected general social, political,
and particularly economic conditions.
He stated that although education has
not been the product of intelligent
planning and control, it has always re
vealed certain essential principles.

Talks by Dnan Grayson N. Kefauver
and Dr. John C. Almack of the Stan
ford School of Education on some of
the problems now facing educators in
the United States opened the six-day
Conference on Curriculum and Instruc
tion which began here yesterday after
noon.
Several hundred school administra
tors and teachers have enrolled for the
conference, which is being sponsored
by the School of Education and which
will continue until June 30. Summer
quarter students may attend the con
ference without charge and may, by
enrolling for Education 235, receive two
units of credit.
Dean Kefauver's talk, "Criticisms of
Curriculum and Instruction," dealt
with current criticisms of established
programs in the schools. Some of these
problems, Kefauver declared, are that
the present curriculum does not ade
quately x-ecognize major social trends
and problems, that the curriculum bears
too little relationship to the life of the
student outside of school, and that the
formal program of schools is too rigid.
"A Long-Range View of the Curricu
lum" was the title of Dr. Almack's dis
cussion. He pointed out • that educa
tional objectives and programs have
appeared in cycles and have, in the
main, reflected general social, political,
and particularly economic conditions.
He stated that although education has
not been the product of intelligent
planning and control, it has always re
vealed certain essential principles.
