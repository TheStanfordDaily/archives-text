# A 						Music Boon to Stanford

### 
Stanford I'niversity and music patrons throughout the vicinity ex
tend a vote of appreciation to Mrs. Klizabeth Sprague Coolidge for her
generosity in bringing the Brussels Pro Arte String Quartet to the I 'ni
vcrsity for an early summer series of the six recitals of the Beethoven
Cycle, The first performance of the long-heralded event proved to be
a decided success in the minds of the large audience of interested listen
ers who attended the initial presentation at the Memorial Church. Judg
ing from the comments of critics among the group it is believed that the
Quartet's series promises to take a place at the top of the list of major
musical events of the summer.
The presentation of the Beethoven Cycle by this noted Quartet is
particularly timely to many of the visiting summer quarter members of
the student body and faculty who ordinarily have little opportunity to
attend a musical series of outstanding importance. The event is one of
primary interest as well to the more musically blase patrons of San Fran
cisco and the peninsular region. There are many who are already more
or less familiar with the various works of Beethoven, but the Cycle and
its rendition by the Pro Arte Quartet is of prime value for two reasons.
First, by virtue of its chronological arrangement it affords the auditor a
panoramic view and comprehensive grasp of the development of Bee
thoven's genius from the early promise of his initial composition*'-to the
finely finished and deathless works of his maturity; and, second, the
Brussels Pro Arte Quartet, generally considered by critics to be distinc
tively among the best of its kind, is most eminently fitted to take the
role of interpreter of a major work such as the Beethoven Cycle.
Stanford is seeking to bring its musical tradition to the highest at
tainable standard. It is through the sponsorship of just such patrons as
Mrs. Coolidge and the resultant availability of the foremost representa
tives of the art that a higher type of musical appreciation can be estab
lished.
