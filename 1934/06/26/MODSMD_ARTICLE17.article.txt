# On Being on Time

### 
We are publishing this editorial early this summer with the view to
saving the Committee on Public Exercises the trouble of appealing to
audiences to arrive at plays and concerts before the curtain rises. We
hope also it will have tlfb effect of saving the Committee the necessity
of closing the Assembly Hall doors to latecomers at the play and the
opera, as was necessary last summer with the presentation of "The
Alad Hopes" during the first act. Latecomers cannot help but be more
or less noisy. The confusion they create is distracting to lecturers and
performers and especially to certain sections of the audience.
The exact hour of beginning each public event is listed in the Weekly
Calendar published each Thursday in the Daily. Newcomers to Stan
ford who will refer to the Calendar and who will endeavor to get ac
customed to Stanford distances and places will make their own and their
fellows' sqjourn here more enjoyable.
