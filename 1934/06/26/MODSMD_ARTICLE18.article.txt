A bouquet is forthcoming for Dink Templeton and the small band
of sturdy athletes who captured the National Collegiate Athletic Asso
ciation track meet last Saturday. It is gratifying to see that the old come
through spirit of Stanford athletes is still in evidence.
Possibly a little larger bouquet should be given to sprinter Jimmy
Willson because of his great performance under adverse conditions, but
very little distinction can really be made among the individual men. The
success of the more than successful season signifies a lot of hard work,
co-operation between coach and men. and evidence of a strong will to win.
