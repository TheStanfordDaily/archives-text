# STANFORD QUINTET TO ATTEND JAPAN STUDENT MEETING
## 
### 
Five Stanford students and a member
of the faculty will be part of a delega
tion of approximately fifty American
college men and women attending a
two-week student conference with Jap
anese undergraduates in Tokio this
summer.
Members of the Stanford contingent
are sailing this week from San Fran
cisco and Seattle. They will land at
Yokohama and be escorted to Tokio by
the Japanese.
While attending the conference in
Tokio, the Americans will be guests in
the homes of the Japanese students, a
courtesy rarely extended to foreigners.
It is hoped that this intimacy will fur
ther the general purpose of the con
ference by promoting a belter under
standing between the two peoples.
At the end of the two weeks' period
in and around Tokio the group will tour
Korea and Manchuria. Some are plan
ning on returning to the United States
immediately after this trip while others
are taking advantage of the opportunity
to visit China and the Philippine Is
lands.
Stanford people attending the con
ference are Hillis Lory, political science
instructor accompanying the students,
Ruth Hunter, Elizabeth Sinclair, Helen
Zimmerman, Nonabel Metzger, and Ar
thur Wright, all of whom have been
officially appointed to attend the confer
ence. Othei's planning to make the trip
in an unofficial capacity include King
Harris, Sam Eastman, and Oliver York.
The delegates are paying their fare
over and back, but while in ex
penses will be borne by the Japanese.
