## 
### 
A large group of plant biologists, in- ]
eluding a Swedish scientist, are visitors
on the Stanford campus this week to t
review the current experimental tax
onomy program of the Stanford labora
tory of the Division of Plant Biology of i
the Carnegie Institution.
The division, having entered new J
phases of its program, under the direc- I
tion of Drs. J. Clausen and D. D. Keck, j
desires to present the program before a .
round table of selected scientists. The j
sessions began yesterday and continue j
through Saturday. Dr. H. A. Spoehr, j
chairman of the Institution's plant biol- ,
ogy division, will preside at most of
the sessions.
The new investigations, which aim to
throw light on the evolution of plant !
life into its present complexity of re
lationships, are being carried forward
at the central laboratory on the Stan- i
ford campus, at the field station in the j
Sierra Nevada at Mather, where the !
elevation is 4,5000 feet, and in the Slate j
