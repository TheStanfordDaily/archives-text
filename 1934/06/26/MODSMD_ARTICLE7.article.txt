# Allen Boosts Music Study In Radio Talk
## University Organist Praises American System of Education Calls Additional Leisure Time a Boon of Depression 
### 
Declaring that "we have the right
sort of music schools and teachers here
iti America—the old bubble of Euro
pean study has been exploded, once
and for all," Wai'ren D. Allen, Uni
versity organist, spoke over KPO on
the Stanford hour last night on "Music
in a Liberal Education."
Tracing the history of music from
the early Greeks, through the Middle
Ages when music was ranked among
the four most important of the seven
liberal arts, he stressed the importance
of continuing the right type of musical
education in the public schools today.
"Stanford is just beginning to give
serious thought to the place of music
in the curriculum," he said. "The uni
versity ideal has been to make men
and women think and to help them
create, in the realms of language, litera
ture, science, and industry, endeavoring
to study each individual's talents and
capacities. The need is now felt for
work which will offer this stimulus to
those who are interested in music.
"In this age of reckless speed and
over-indulgence in sensational pictures,
jazz, and alcohol, the depression may
have its beneficial aspects if it gives us
some leisure in which to enjoy the real
ly good things of life—books, plays, art,
and music."
On next Monday's radio hour, Dr.
Donald A. Carson, clinical instructor
in the School of Medicine, will speak
on "The Function *>f the Modei'n Doc
tor."
