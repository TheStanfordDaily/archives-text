# Supreme Court Denies Stanford Liquor Protest
## 
### 
Back to its original status went Palo
Alto's liquor sales problem when the
California State Supreme Court denied
a petition for a writ of review against
the State Board of Equalization for its
issuance of liquor selling permits to the
proprietor of a Mayfield pharmacy. The
writ was asked by the Trustees of
Stanford University, who held that
liquor sales by the store in question
would constitute a violation of the rule
which prohibits the sale of intoxicants
within one mile and a half of the Uni
versity.
According to Palo Alto City Attorney
Arnold Rumwell, the court's action is
indicative of a feeling on its part that
there exists a remedy for the situation
other than the issuance of the writ, such
a writ being issued only in the event
that no other remedy is in view. The
only course left for Palo Alto and Uni
versity interests is to await a test case
which may arise out of the arrest of a
liquor vendor operating within one mile
and a half of the boundaries of the
campus. Attorney Rumwell stated that
the University trustees could expect
no further action from the Supreme
Court other than appellate consideration
in the event that such a test case should
occur.
