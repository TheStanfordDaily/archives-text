# Davidson Gives Two Talks On Modern Poetry
## Thinks Poetry of Yates And Frost Most Likely To Survive Says "Mechanistic" Verse Will Be Forgotten 
### 
Edward Davison, English poet-critic,
this week treated Stanford audiences to
two interesting talks on poetry in gen
eral and modern poetry in particular.
Tuesday night he talked on "The Ap
proach to Poetry" and Wednesday aft
ernoon continued on "Poetry in Our
Time."
In his first talk he emphasized the
fact that poetry, to be known beyond
its own generation, cannot be written
about anything peculiar to that gen
eration alone, but must be written on a
theme common to people of all genera
tions. In the same manner, poetry, he
predicted, cannot be written for a par
ticular class of intellectuals and survive
the period in which those intellectuals
were dominant.
Throughout his talk he stressed this
basic appeal to the emotions of the man
of all ages, the appeal of fear, hate, love,
and wonder that has dominated all
poetry that has survived through the
years. Some of his own poems, which
he read, illustrated this point.
Yates and Frost Will Live
In his second talk, Mr. Davison
brought out the fact that one cannot, as
yet, definitely say who the better poets
of today may be. We are still too close
to that period of "spiritual disintegra
tion" which characterized the years pre
ceding, during, and following the World
War. We cannot view the works of to
day in the manner in which they will be
viewed by later generations.
He ventured to predict, however, that
among the English poets W. B. Yates
will stand out in years to come. He
made this prediction on the grounds
that Yates is today loved by all classes
of people and that his work has the
quality of appealing to people of all
ages. Of the American poets, he chose
Robert Frost because of his ability to
appeal both to the subtle and to the
simple mind at the same time. Other
poets were discussed in the same man
ner, but these two were outstanding.
The poet discussed the trend toward
poetry dealing with things of .the ma
chine age and predicted that all such
would soon be forgotten. The better
poets of today, he said, are writing of
the same things the Greeks wrote about.
These are things that not only would
have appealed to the Greeks or early
English but will appeal to the man of
centuries in the future.
