# Cinderella and Her Slipper Theme of Puppet Show
## 
### 
The age-old but perennially popular ,
tale of Cinderella and the Little Glass
Slipper will be re-enacted once more
in modern fashion by Perry Dilley's
Puppets on their diminutive stage in
the dance studio of the Women's gym- j
nasium next Tuesday evening at 8
o'clock.
The puppet play adheres to the old
story in every detail, but the charac
terizations are distinctly contemporary
and original. The bad sisters and step
mother have been declared "so real that
you have the impression that you have j
met them before, in a street-car, or at
the grocery, at least."
Sophronia, the elder sister, affects bad
headaches and bad French; but Porcina,
the other sister, is unashamed of her
prodigious appetite and admits freely
that a party without lots of refresh
ments is a dull affair. Cinderella, al
though oppressed with hard work and
unkindness, is not portrayed as a
wretched cinder wench but as a neat,
intelligent girl with a sense of humor.
Her first glamorous evening with the ]
Prince, in his moonlit garden, leaves
nothing to be desired in the way of ro
mance.
Fifteen puppets work in this play in i

which are three acts. Special scenery
was built to accomplish the magical
transformations required by the story.

This is Perry Dilley's latest and most
elaborate production.
Dilley started making and playing
puppets in 1919, and now has one of the
largest repertoires in the country. He is
internationally known as an authority

i on the art of the hand puppet. Books !
J published in Germany and in Japan last 1
year carried photos of his puppets and j
\ accounts of his work.
The characters in the puppet show
| are: Cinderella; Her Stepmother; Her
i two Stepsisters; Porcina and Sophronia; [
; Micheal; Her Cat; Her Fairygodmother;
i Pistachio; A Footman to the Prince;
i Guests at the ball: Fritz, a cellist who j
is late; Henri, the chef and his assist- I
ants; and Prince Charming.
There are three scenes: Kitchen in j
Cinderella's Home; Prince Charming's
Garden; Kitchen again, the next morn- |
j ing-
Dilley's puppets are about 18 inches
high, and the heads and hands are care- |
fully carved and painted to create an '
illusion. The work of rehearsal, in
which the little actors are trained to I
j "talk" and play at their various parts in ;
i a natural fashion, involves several ar- !
I duous months for the "puppeteers." Mr.
Dilley and his assistants have at their
j command more than four dozen voices
for the different characters of their,
troupe. None of the puppets used by
Dilley is worked by strings; all are ;
hand worked.
