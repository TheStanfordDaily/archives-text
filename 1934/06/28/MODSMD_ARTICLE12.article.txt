# Hanna Asks Schools To Awaken Pupils' Social Responsibility
## Columbia Educator Offers Basic Program For Child framing Dr. Hand Also Addresses Curriculum Parley 
### 
Dr. Paul Hanna of Columbia Univer
sity's Tcachers College before the Cur
rieulurn Conference yesterday afternoon
called for an increase of pupil partici
pation in socially useful work which
will benefit the child m sharing the re
sponsibility of co-operative living.
The afternoon's long three hour as
sembly also included an address by
Stanford's Dr. Harold C. Hand whose
views, he said, presented "what a young
man believes the educational program
of the future will be." He stressed the
need of pointing out to the student how
the world has come into the state in
which it finds itself, and training the
child to fit himself into the world in
which he will, in the future, find him
self.
Dr. Hand's suggestions pointed to five
basic fields of training which must be
included in the coming program of
teaching in the secondary schools.
Among them he included the study of
physical and social environment and a
training in handicraft, language, and
physical play arts.

The director of secondary curriculum
in the Los Angeles city schools. Dr. W.
B. Featherstone, presented some of the
work which has been done in Los An
geles to revise the outworn curriculum
which has not kept pace with the de
velopment of contemporary machines.
He advises the fusion of fields of broader
subjects and functional objectives. The
plans involving extensive rearrange
ments of subject departments also in
volves, in his mind, a unification of the
whole curriculum in relation to central
themes. The teacher, therefore, is given
a skeleton plan to follow at his own
discretion, ever keeping within the gen
eral plan.
Expounds Collectivism
Dr. Harold Hand's ideas and prog
nostications created a slightly smaller
furor as he expounded his collective
theories and actualities. Declaring that
the old order has passed, and that
whether we like it or not, today we are
in the collective society we have learned
to dread through tradition and custom.
The first group of general sessions
ended with yesterday afternoon's pres
entations and discussions. Last night
the divisions met in separate and smal
ler groups to provide an opportunity
for each of the members of the confer
ence to present his criticism of the ex
isting offerings for curriculum reform.
The conference will have another
general session in the Assembly Hall on
Saturday afternoon with presentations
by Dr. Jesse B. Sears of Stanford on
"Identifying and Correcting Weaknesses
in Curricula," and by Stanford's Dr.
William Martin Proctor on "How to
Proceed in Reconstructing the Curricu
lum."
Saturday evening's conference ban
quet at the Union will conclude the
summer meeting. President Ray Lyman
Wilbur will be the main speaker at the
banquet, and Dr. John C. Almack will
be the toastmaster of the evening.

Urges Fusing Fields
The director of secondary curriculum
in the Los Angeles city schools. Dr. W.
B. Featherstone, presented some of the
work which has been done in Los An
geles to revise the outworn curriculum
which has not kept pace with the de
velopment of contemporary machines.
He advises the fusion of fields of broader
subjects and functional objectives. The
plans involving extensive rearrange
ments of subject departments also in
volves, in his mind, a unification of the
whole curriculum in relation to central
themes. The teacher, therefore, is given
a skeleton plan to follow at his own
discretion, ever keeping within the gen
eral plan.
Expounds Collectivism
Dr. Harold Hand's ideas and prog
nostications created a slightly smaller
furor as he expounded his collective
theories and actualities. Declaring that
the old order has passed, and that
whether we like it or not, today we are
in the collective society we have learned
to dread through tradition and custom.
The first group of general sessions
ended with yesterday afternoon's pres
entations and discussions. Last night
the divisions met in separate and smal
ler groups to provide an opportunity
for each of the members of the confer
ence to present his criticism of the ex
isting offerings for curriculum reform.
The conference will have another
general session in the Assembly Hall on
Saturday afternoon with presentations
by Dr. Jesse B. Sears of Stanford on
"Identifying and Correcting Weaknesses
in Curricula," and by Stanford's Dr.
William Martin Proctor on "How to
Proceed in Reconstructing the Curricu
lum."
Saturday evening's conference ban
quet at the Union will conclude the
summer meeting. President Ray Lyman
Wilbur will be the main speaker at the
banquet, and Dr. John C. Almack will
be the toastmaster of the evening.
Dr. Paul Hanna of Columbia Univer
sity's Tcachers College before the Cur
rieulurn Conference yesterday afternoon
called for an increase of pupil partici
pation in socially useful work which
will benefit the child m sharing the re
sponsibility of co-operative living.
The afternoon's long three hour as
sembly also included an address by
Stanford's Dr. Harold C. Hand whose
views, he said, presented "what a young
man believes the educational program
of the future will be." He stressed the
need of pointing out to the student how
the world has come into the state in
which it finds itself, and training the
child to fit himself into the world in
which he will, in the future, find him
self.
Dr. Hand's suggestions pointed to five
basic fields of training which must be
included in the coming program of
teaching in the secondary schools.
Among them he included the study of
physical and social environment and a
training in handicraft, language, and
physical play arts.
