# Enter Mr. Roosevelt
## 
### 
President Roosevelt has appointed a mediation board as a last resort
to untangle the lifty-day-old longshoremen's tie-up in San Francisco.
The arbitrators named are Archbishop Edward J. 11 anna and Attorney
O. K. ('ushing, of San Francisco. and Edward I". McGradv, assistant
secretary of labor.
It is quite probable that the resulting mediation will solve the strike.
These men are well suited for the task of arbitration and for bringing
the opposing factions to agreement. I lowever. it should be noted care
fully that it is not the fact that these particular men were chosen nor
that there is Ix-ing held another attempt at mediation which is important,
but rather the fact that it is President Roosevelt who this time has done
the choosing that will determine the outcome of the arbitration.
Anyone fitting himself for the future tasks of life will do well to
observe the immediate development of the longshoremen's strike and the
effect that Mr. Roosevelt's action will have. The President is one of the
few holders of the highest office who has solved social problems by sheer
force of personality. A high score in the student directory is a pleasing
thing to look at. but the final test in life is often the force of personality
one can throw into the struggle at a crucial moment. Men are swayed
by persons they like, not by persons who merely know more than they do.
