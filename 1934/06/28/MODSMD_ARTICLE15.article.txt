# A 						Professional Meeting
## 
### 
There may arise often in the minds of school teachers doubts as to
the propriety of regarding their work as a profession. In fact, a pretty
good case may be made for the argument that they are more akin to
"wage slaves" than to doctors and lawyers. Hut as evidence that they
possess at least one characteristic of professions, they may regard with
satisfaction the Conference on Curriculum and Instruction behind held
on the Stanford campus this week.
The purpose of the conference is. briefly, self-criticism. Entirely on
their own time and at their own expense, several hundred school admin
istrators and teachers have gathered here to make and to listen to criti
cisms of the present courses of study and methods of instruction.
They are not discussing tenure laws, ways and means of getting their
salaries raised, or how to deal with boards of education —problems that
arc serious to them personally. They are discussing ways of making
their services more valuable to the communities they serve. They arc
working for the l>enefit of the pupils in their schools. Indeed, they are
not. Mere "wage slaves" would not be concerned.
I'.y their meeting here these educators admit that they do not "know
all the answers." thereby disproving the frequently heard criticism that
they are a smug, complacent group satisfied merely with maintaining the
old order. They are not satisfied and they are seeking new and l>etter
ways. That is another characteristic of a profession.
