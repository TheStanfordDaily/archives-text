# Free Rides in the Summer
## 
### 
A pleasant tiling to watch on (lie Stanford campus is tlie gentle
treatment of pedestrians. Those without cars, who would have to hoof ii
to Palo Alto and hack except for the charity of some passing motorist,
are accustomed to a much kindlier fate than is usually dealt out to the
common hitch-hiker who must wait indefinitely for a lift.
During the regular school year the traveler to and from the campus
need only stand at any prominent corner on the campus or at the bus
stops in Palo Alto, and without being reduced to the indignity of thumb
ing like the common hitch-hiker, he is assured a ride with the first pass
ing driver who has room.
Many are familiar with the spirit of helpfulness between the motorist
and the pedestrian at Stanford. And the scarcity of rides during sum
mer quarter gives a special opportunity and obligation to motorists on
the campus.
