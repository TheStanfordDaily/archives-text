# OLD CAMPUS WINNERY HAS DIVERSE CAREER
## 
### 
The Palo Alto Stock Farm, located
over on the dirt road leading from the
Mausoleum to the Convalescent Home,
narrowly escaped being the stronghold
of the Stanford Rough, when, many
years ago, the University officials were
casting about for a new dormitory.
In those days the large building was
brick red and had held an important
place in Stanford history as the "Farm"
winery. With the founding of the Uni
versity, the place fell into disuse and it
came within an ace of being remodeled
as a hall for students. For the past many
years the building and the fields about
it have been leased to various tenants
for truck farming. Six and seven years
ago its strawberry patches lured the
studentry and on many a moonlit night
could be heard the reverberation of
shotguns, loaded with rock salt, being
discharged at berry pickers by the irate
Mexican tenants. In the past few years,
undesired tomatoes have been the ma
jor product of the vicinity.
Not until a year or so ago when the
land was leased to a dairy were the old
wine presses removed from the build
ing's foundations and the cobwebby
casks tumbled about in its musty cor
ners rolled aside for the advent of milk
pails and cream separators.
