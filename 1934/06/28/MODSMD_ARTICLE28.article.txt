# W. D. Allen to Introduce Thursday Organ Recitals
## 
### 
Beginning a series of Thursday after
noon organ recitals, Warren D. Allen,
University organist, will play tomorrow
the Chorale in A Minor by Caesar
Franck, a Fantasia in D Flat Major by
Camille Saint-Saens, the Andante Can
tabile from Widor's Fourth Symphony,
and Finale from Louis Vierne's First
Symphony.
The recitals will be held each Thurs
day at 4:15 o'clock and every Sunday at
7:30 o'clock.
A clock runs faster in cold weather;
the cold shortens the pendulum.
