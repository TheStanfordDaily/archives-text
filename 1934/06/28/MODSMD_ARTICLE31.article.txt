### 
Five members of the victorious Stan
ford track team are in the East com
peting in the forty-seventh annual
American Outdoor Track and Field
championship meet in Milwaukee this
week-end under the banner of the
Olympic Club of San Francisco. The
team includes John Lyman and Gordan
Dunn in the weight events, John Mott
ram in the javelin, and Bud Deacon in
the pole vault. A1 Blackmail, 1.C.4-A.
400-meter champ, is also running under
the Club colors.
Jimmy Willson and Sam Klopstock
were invited to compete as members of
the Club team, but they have decided
to hang up their spikes for the rest of
the summer.
Record breaking duels loom in al
most every event, and the meet prom
ises to produce some outstanding per
formances. Ben Eastman, Stanford's
recently graduated middle distance star,
will compete against the country's
greatest half-milers in this event. It
will be one of the outstanding attrac
tions of the meet, and sports fans are
predicting a new record.
