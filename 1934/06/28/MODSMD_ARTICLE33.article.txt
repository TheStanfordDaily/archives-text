# STANFORD SOURED ON GRID GAME INSURANCE
## 
### 
Like many another university, Stan
ford too has undertaken to insure foot
ball games or other outdoor athletic
fetes from inclement weather. And like
many another university, Stanford has
steadfastly refused to "bite" again.
It was back in 1904, with an inter
sectional game with the University of
Chicago in the offing, that Stanford of
ficials viewed the threatening clouds
with alarm, hurriedly called a "huddle"
and decided to sign on the dotted line
for weather insurance. The policy cost
$8,000 and was to pay double the amount
if it should rain on that particular Sat
urday.
Saturday dawned, not fresh and clear,
but with overcast skies and a chill wind.
A typical San Francisco fog drifted in
and bought a box seat for the afternoon.
Not a drop of rain fell all day, but the
skies cast their gloomy spell from dawn
to dusk. Fearful of the impending storm,
the expected multitudes stayed at home,
even though radios and Ernie Smith
were not of that generation.
The net deficit for the afternoon,
counting in the $8,000 policy, was too
much for the University. Never again
has the administration, or, in a later
day, the 8.A.C., played the insurance
game.
With the advent of the Columbia
wash-out in the Rose Bowl at Pasadena
last New Year's Day, however, another
venture into the realm of high finance
may be forthcoming.
