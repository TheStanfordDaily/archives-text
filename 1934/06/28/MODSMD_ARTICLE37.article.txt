The Brussels Pro Arte String Quartet
will present the second recital of the
Beethoven Cycle tomorrow afternoon
in the dance studio of the Roble gym
nasium. The quartet, known through
out the world for its excellent interpre

brought to Stanford by Mrs. Elizabeth
Sprague Coolidge.
The recital will start promptly at
