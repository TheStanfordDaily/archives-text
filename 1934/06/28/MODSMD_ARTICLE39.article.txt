THE IKON RING
AROUND GERMANY
j Before (he World War, German states
: men gave as their reason for arming
I the "iron ring" of alliances completely
j encircling them and their three allies.
I This situation had quite a little to do
j with causing the war. Today the same
I sort of thing is developing, but in a
j way even more unfavorable to Ger
many.
France's central European friends
j (Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Rumania,
; and Poland) which she supports finan
-1 cially, are of course worried over the
I Hitler menace. As long as France plays
| the role of rich uncle to them they can
j be counted on to oppose the Hitler
regime and its policies.
| But even more important in the past
I year was the new friendship between
J Poland and Russia —prompted of course
I by the rise of the Nazis. This soon
| ripened into a sort of comradeship be
! tween France and Russia. Lately the
I foreign ministers of both countries have
j been seen talking together in dark cor
i ners about something very interesting
I to both of them. So France and Russia
1 are right back where they wei'e in 1914
; —though not on paper.
England, which was inclined to favor
j Germany before Hitler, is now definitely
against his policies and all they stand
for.
All this has prompted a big re-arma
| ment race—even bigger than in 1913-14.
I It is inevitable that Germany will soon
■ be as strong as most of her neighbors—
i but not as strong as all of them put to
| gether. So, politically at least, Germany
i it; pretty well surrounded by enemies.
HITLER AN
ECONOMIC FAILURE
It is a strange thing that Hitler, who
was elected because of the depression
i and other economic troubles, has no
j economic policies at all. 1 * This has led to
j serious financial difficulties in Germany.
In order to pay her debts Germany
1 has to export mqre than she imports.
The anti-Nazi boycotts have helped to
i wipe out her export surplus cora
; plctely. Finding that payment on her
j foreign debts was impossible, Germany
last week did the only possible thing
suspended payments on all private
debts, the Dawes and Young Plan bonds
included. England and France struck
back at once; they seized all German
bank balances.in their countries. Thus
Germany •frag- also strt*roundes eco
nomically as well as politically.-'
THE OUTCOME
WAR OR PEACE?
Caught in this jam, Hitler visited No.
1 Dictator Mussolini, from whom he
has learned little. Correspondents' re-

ported the Nazi leaded "dazed" by the
Fascist military display and by being
forced to play second fiddle. It seems
that Hitler found Italy would be very
unneighborly if he tried to take over-
Austria and thus get that much closer
to Mussolini.
So these developments in Europe:
the unanimous decision not to pay for
the last war; the unanimous increase of
armaments to get ready for the next
one, and the almost unanimous getting
together of countries with little in com
mon except suspicion of their neigh
bors, might lead to a very gloomy out
look for peace.
But there is no doubt that few people
really want war; the risks are much
greater than they were twenty years
ago today, and the outcome far more
uncertain. Europe has a habit of drift
ing from crisis to cri.sis; this one may
be no exception—though there is bound
to be one some day.
