# WORK STARTED ON ADDITION TO CELLAR
## 
### 
Following the plans approved by the
Union Board of Governors calling for
an, expenditure of $25,000 for enlarge
ment of the Cellar, George Wagner,
San Franciseo contractor, started exca
vation Tuesday, June 26.
The construction plans call for the
addition of a large sunroom at the north
end of the present building which will
make possible quicker accommodation
for the crowds at rush periods. The
kitchen space will be extended to give
more room for dishwashing machines.
Anticipation of a larger enrollment
fall quarter, the increased number of
women on the campus, and inconven
ience from cramped space in the kitchen
were given as,the reasons for the action,
according to Professor William B.
Owjens, chairman of the Union Board of
Governors.
George Wagner, the contractor,
stated that work is expected to be com
pleted before the ypening of the au
tumn quarter.
