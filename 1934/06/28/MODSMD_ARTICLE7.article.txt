! and Sandals readings.
Shelley Smith, youngest daughter of
â–  Ihe late Prof. Everett W. Smith, has
l been assigned the role of the ingenue,
| Elaine Harker, daughter of the house
i hold, a part both romantic and sophisti
j cated. Shelley Smith made her drama
-1 tic debut in the Stanford production of
| "Distant Drums" early this year. She
! is best remembered on the stage for her
; excellent portrayal of the role of Eliza
beth Rimplegar of "Three Cornered

formerly of the Marlboro School for
Girls, Los Angeles, and has played

claim to oddity to her fondness for an 1
undertaker's assistant.
So far these are the only roles that
have been filled. Men interested in the |
mature roles of the old Dr. Harker or
the neurotic financier, Wilson Everett, I
and students who may be interested in 1
