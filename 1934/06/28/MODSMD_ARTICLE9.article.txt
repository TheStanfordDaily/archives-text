# Raps Textbook Study Method
## LaPiere's Statement Stirs Curriculum Conference Debate 
### 
Although Prof. Richard T. LaPiere
did not speak in person to Tuesday
afternoon's Curriculum Conference, the
reading of his paper to the audience by
Dr. Alvin C. Eurich of the University
of Minnesota, created a controversy
which dominated the afternoon's dis
cussion by the panel and the audience.
LaPiere's paper, "Developments in
Social Psychology That Have Implica
tions for the Curriculum and Instruc
tion," suggested that the textbook
method of instruction was an impracti
cable device for teaching. Actual ex
perience, he designated as the best way
by which the student can learn. Pro
fessor LaPiere also stressed the need of
a human touch in the school between
the student and his instructor.
"The teacher should step from his
lofty pedestal to become a real leader
as does the scoutmaster," he concluded.
Dr. Reginald Bell made the after
noon's opening presentation with a
paper on "Developments in Social Psy
chology Which Have Implications for
the Curriculum Worker."
Dr. Bell stressed the importance of
the education of the whole child emo
tionally as well as mentally. He also
asserted that the fi'actionated teaching,
which includes grade skipping and
over-emphasis on intellectual schooling
in the grammar grades, was undoubt
edly detrimental to the child.
Prof. Theodore J. Kreps, of Stanford,
and Dr. C. C. Peters, of the Pennsyl
vania State College, at the evening ses
sion recited the contemporary economic
and social developments from which
the curriculum workers can learn a
great deal.
