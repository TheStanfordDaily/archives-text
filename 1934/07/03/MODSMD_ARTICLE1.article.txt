# Dilley Puppets Will Act Story Of Cinderella
## Famous Fairy Tale Will Live on Miniature Stage Tonight Tiny Actors Are Famous in California 
### 
California's pioneer puppet artist and
producer, Perry Dilley, will bring "Cin
derella and Her Glass Slipper" to a
miniature stage in the Women's Gym
nasium tonight at 8 o'clock.
Deviating from the popular concep
tion of puppeteering, Dilley's puppets
arc manipulated without the aid of
strings, all the figures being of the
"hand-puppet" type. Dilley is a recog
nized authority on this form of puppetry
and was one of the first in the United
States to build and exhibit this kind of
figure. Though less commonly seen, the
hand puppet is equally as effective as
other types and Dilley has developed its
use in all of his shows.
For the past eighteen years Dilley
has been making puppets and produc
ing exhibits of them in this state. His
shows have received enthusiastic ac
claim, particularly at several of Cali
fornia's larger colleges and universities,
where he has offered courses in puppet
construction and manipulation.
In addition to the play to be pro
duced here tonight, Dilley's repertory
includes 19 other shows calling for
more than four dozen voices, which
Dilley and his assistants have at their
command.
Dilley's '"Cinderella" follows the old
fairy tale in detail but promises to
heighten interest through clever scen
ery and design and the fresh, humorous
gaiety that is distinctly associated with
skillful puppetry.
