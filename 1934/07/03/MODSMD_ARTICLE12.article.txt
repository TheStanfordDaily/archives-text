i the methods and techniques used in
teaching. In studying and correcting

theoretical aspect as well as the prac
tical aspect must be considered.

must be recognized as the social com
position of the adults in a school dis
trict as well as the abilities of the chil
'dren to be discovered through tests.

self, his abilities and aspirations.
