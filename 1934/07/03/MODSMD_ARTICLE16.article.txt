upholding Mrs. Stanford's request that there he no smoking on the Ouad.
The Daily realizes that the old grads forget and that the newcomers
have no way of knowing, hut the tradition stands just the same—no
smoking on the Quad.
There-is no academic ruling regarding this custom —the University
will not compel you to ohev the tradition. Stanford students, however,
ever since the beginning of the school, have made it an unwritten custom
to respect Mrs. Stanford's wish. If you hadn't heard before or have for
