# Collegians Vote on New Deal
## 
### 
llow explain the results of tlx* current Literary Digest poll of .college
students on the New Deal â€”especially the results of balloting in liastern
colleges? Approximately 60 per cent of Harvard and Yale students ap
prove the New Deal policies, "on the whole," whereas in 1932 three out
of four Harvard and Vale students preferred Mr. I loover to Mr. Roose
velt.
Already the editorial writers have begun to speculate on the signifi
cance of the poll. Some of them have analyzed the personalities of Mr.
Roosevelt and Mr. Hoover, and liave concluded that since both men were
in power and and were admired by the students their personalities and
policies had met with student approval. Others have analyzed the results,
as they did in 1 ( >32. in terms of the home environment of the students
and point out that the consequences of presidential policies do not di
rectly reach many of the students whether the policies be New Deal
or Old Deal. At any rate, there is acceptance of "results" in both in
states. This probably indicates complacency rather than any serious
analysis of the economic and social situation.
