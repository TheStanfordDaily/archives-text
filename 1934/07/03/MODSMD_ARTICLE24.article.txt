# BIOLOGISTS STUDY TARWEED IN PLANT CONFERENCE HERE
## Famous Scientists Consider Flora Conservation for America 
### 
Tarweed occupied much of the at
tention of a group of learned scientists
from all over the United States and
even from Europe in conference at the
Carnegie Institution of Plant Biology
here last week.
Tarweed, in scientific circles, is known
as Madinae, and certain species of it
carry such impressive names as Hemi
zonia-Deinandra and Hemizonia-Cen
tromadia. Here at Stanford and in the
two mountain field stations at Mather
and Timberline they have been doing
some special research on tarweed. They
have been crossing the various species
and studying the resultant hybrids.
This is a recent development and has
not as yet progressed to the stage that
any definite information can be pub
lished, but it was shown that, in any
particular locus, the self-sterile species
varies just as much as the self-fertile
species. It was also brought out that in
each of the species crossed a common
denominator is usually found that will
cross easily, such as the species Fitchii
in work with Hemizonia-Centromadia.
Of interest also were findings concern
ing the geographical distribution of
Madinae. Many of the species are very
rare and are rapidly disappearing.
During the last session here, the biol
ogists discussed the very evident lack
of conservation of flora in this country
as compared to the intensive work done
in Europe. The national park system of
the United States was cited as an ex
cellent example of what could be done
toward preserving the features of na
ture and thus allowing an intensive
study without the disturbing influence
ol' artificial fdctors.
During the latter part of the week
seven members of the group visited the
field stations at Mather and Timberline
in the mountains, and were to return
through Placerville, where they were to
visit the Institute of Plant Genetics.
