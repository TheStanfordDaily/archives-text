##

Five damage suits totaling $226,105
and naming as defendants Don Tatum,
president of the Class of 1934 and of
last year's Interfraternity Council, and
his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Frank Tatum,
were taken off the calendar of the court
of Superior Judge Maxwell McNutt
yesterday in Redwood City. Although
it was not definitely ascertained, set
tlement out of court was indicated.
This action, which is said to be one
(xf the largest of its kind ever to be
brought in San Mateo County, and for
which two days were set aside on the
calendar of the Superior Court, grew
out of an accident which occurred the
day after the Big Game last year.
