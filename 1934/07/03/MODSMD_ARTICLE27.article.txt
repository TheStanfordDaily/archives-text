# CELEBRATION IN SILENCE? Palo Alto Bars Noise BAN FIREWORKS ON 4TH
## 
### 
Residents of Stanford and Palo Alto
may sleep soundly on the morning of
the Fourth of July, secure in the
knowledge that they are not going to
be jarred from the arms of Morpheus
by some ear-splitting detonation.
Chief Dugan promises that the wrath
of the gods, the fire department, and
the police will descend on any erring
student who should happen to be caught
setting off firecrackers on the campus
anywhere except on Lagunita.
Palo Alto, like most other cities, does
not allow any fireworks within the city
limits, so as far as Stanford is con
cerned the Fourth will be quiet on all
fronts.
There will probably be a lot of picnics
in the hills behind the campus, and the
Fire Department wishes to warn every
one to be careful about starting grass
fires as everything is pretty dry and a
fire, with a proper wind, could easily
spread and do untold damage.
