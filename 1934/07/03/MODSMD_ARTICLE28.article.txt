# Melish Gives Sermon On Youth and Future
## 
### 
"Youth and America's Future" was
the subject taken by the Rev. John
Howard Melish of New York in the
Memorial Church services Sunday.
'America is still in its infancy," he
said. "A future longer than our past
awaits us. Shall we leave the future
to unplanned order, subject to the long,
cruel, and costly competition wherein
men are the victims, or shall we plan
it for the common good under the lead
ership of intelligence? Men trained to
build will not hesitate to answer. The
engineers should be the new pioneers."

Strangest name in the summer quar
ter "bawlout," now on sale at the
Comptroller's office, is Koon Hai Ng,
from the Dutch East Indies.
The "bawlout," as all old Stanford
men know, is the directory of officers
and students. Inspection of the tabula
tion in the back pages reveals 239 fac
ulty members, 547 students. That is
just about one officer of instruction to
every two students, offering unparal
leled opportunities for education.
