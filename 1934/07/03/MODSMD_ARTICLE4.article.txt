# Odegard Speaks Thursday Night
## 
### 
A subject of current interest to every
one, particularly to students of govern
ment, will be discussed Thursday night
by Professor Peter H. Odegard, acting
professor of political science from Ohio
State University, as he continues the
lecture series arranged by the Stanford
Public Exercises Committee.
In his talk on "Some Aspects of Con
temporary Politics," Professor Odegard
will deal with the subject of the con
stitutionality of extensive economic
planning by the Federal Government.
Many writers on contemporary gov
ernment have held that governmental
regulation of prices, production, and
working conditions in industry is not in
accordance with the principles of the
Constitution. Professor Odegard takes
exception to this stand and will at
tempt to show that economic planning
is constitutional. He will attempt to
show that economic planning is con
stitutional. He will support his case
with, among other things, decisions of
the United States Supreme Court.
Due to the fact that the courts have,
to date, merely upheld the light of a
state to exercise control in the public
interest, and have not finally passed on
the constitutionality of the NRA and its
sister organizations, this discussion
should be of particular interest to ev
eryone.
Professor Odegard will talk at 8
o'clock in the Dance Studio of the
Women's Gymnasium. There is no ad
mission charge.
Visiting faculty women will be hon
ored at a summer meeting of the Fac
ulty Women's Club to be held Monday
afternoon at 3 o'clock in the Women's
Clubhouse. MLss Anastasia Doyle, di
rector of Roble Hall, will be the speak
er and there will be music by Mrs.
C. G. Wrenn, Mrs. George Wettach, arid
Mrs. J. H. C. Smith.
