# Dr. Von Klenze Predicts Chaos If Nazis Break
## Notes Troubled Week-End Among Germany's Big Party Leaders States Opinion of Hitler's Political Policies 
### 
"There will be chaos in Europe if
there is another collapse in Germany,"
Professor Camillo von Klenze, acting
professor of German here, told his au
dience Thursday evening in his lecture
at the Women's Gymnasium on "Re
cent Currents in the Intellectual Life
of Germany."
The week-end saw much in the way
of possible chaos, with Chancellor
Adolph Hitler's police snuffing out the
lives of several of his men who allegedly
were engaging in subversive activities.
Several others are supposed to have
committed suicide.
Asked by the Daily yesterday if his
statements last Thursday could be
linked up with what took place less than
48 hours later, the professor replied:
"It is not collapse. It appears to mean
severer organization. Something has
happened over there, there is no doubt
of that, but we won't be able to discover
just what took place for about a week."
Von Klenze may be remembered by
Stanford students of last quarter as the
man who disputed the authenticity of
stories relative to harsh treatment —
administering of large doses of castor
oil, etc.—to Germans slow to fall in line
with the Nazi regime. He told the Daily
yesterday that he was sympathetic with
some of the Hitler policies, and un
sympathetic with others.
