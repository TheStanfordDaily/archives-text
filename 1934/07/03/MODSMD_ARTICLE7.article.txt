# CARSON TELLS RADIO AUDIENCE OF DUTIES OF TODAY'S DOCTOR
## 
### 
It Ls a misapprehension that the in
tensive and detailed laboratory tests
now common ih the physician's diagno
sis are real substitutes for physical ex
amination and questioning of the pa
tient, asserted Dr. Donald Carson, clini
cal instructor in the Stanford University
School of Medicine, who spoke last
night to the KPO radio audience on
the "Activities of the Practicing Phy
sician."
Speaking as the feature of "The Stan
ford University Program," Dr. Carson
stressed the fact that the practicing phy
sician's two main activities are those
which had their beginning in the time
of Hippocrates, the great physician of
ancient Greece. The modern physician's
approach is first, "to listen to the pa
tient's story of his illness," and second,
"to examine the patient's body."
Methods borrowed from other
branches of science, including biology,
chemistry, and physics, have enabled
the physician to supplement the ordi
nary means of physical examination
with exacting tests, such as tests of
the urine, counting the blood cells, the
Wasserman test, the basal metabolism,
the electro-cardiograph, tests of the
spinal fluid, and others; but questioning
of the patient and an examination of
his body still remain the physician's
fundamental work, according to Dr.
Carson.
Different cases and different symp
toms require variations in the amount
of trust which can be placed in ques
tioning the patient, in examining his
body, and in applying detailed tests, Dr.
Carson said. Where the patient has
been constantly under the physician's
observation as would be the position of
the patient going to the family physi
cian, great weight must be given the
patient's testimony; but where physi
cians are employed by insurance and
other firms to examine applicants for
policies, the physician must seek evi
dence from physical examination and
special tests rather than from the testi
mony of a patient who might be preju
diced from self-interest, Dr. Carson
reminded his listeners.
