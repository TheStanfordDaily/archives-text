# 2 Actors Chosen For Men's Roles In Campus Play
## 
### 
Recent tryouts for "The Doctor's
Wife" succeeded in filling two of the
three leading men's roles. The female
cast has already been chosen.
William Gwinn, graduate student of
public speaking, has been picked to
fill the part of Doctor Harker, one of
the most difficult character portrayals
of the play. Harker is the typical prac
ticing doctor, enjoying a fair income
but continually losing it bit by bit in
unsound investments.
Gwinn, who will interpret the role,
is remembered for his part as Pike in
the Stanford production of "Distant
Drums" earlier this year. He has par
ticipated in various readings, including
Bolingbroke in "Richard II."
The part of Wilson Everett, the neu
rotic financier, has been filled by Frank
H. O'Neill, former business manager
of the College Players, University of
San Francisco. It is Wilson Everett, the
family friend and boyhood suitor of
Mrs. Harker, who finally finds the one
set of stocks which makes the Harkers
financially independent, thus bringing
about the laughable breakup of Dr.
Harker and his imaginative women pa
tients. In the meanwhile Wilson Ever
ett forgets his ulcer long enough to buy
the daughter of the family a new
roadster. These two beneficent contri
butions outweigh, in the minds of the
family, the drawback of having promi
nently displayed in the living room a
graphic drawing of Uncle Everett's in
terior.
Frank O'Neill, who will portray the
role of Everett, is the author of various
short stories and serials which have
appeared over several radio stations
and the Columbia and National Broad
casting Company networks. Included
among these are "Stranger than Fic
tion," which appeared for twelve weeks
over the NBC network in 1931; "The
Terror Ship," ten weeks over Columbia-
Don Lee in the same year; and "The
Ghost Story," thirty weeks over KTAB
in 1932.
The female roles, previously filled,
are Dr. Margery Bailey of the English
department as Mrs. Harker, the doc
tor's wife; Shelley Smith in the ingenue
role of Elaine Harker, the daughter;
and Rosemary Sistrom in the role of
the maid who prefers as a sweetheart
the undertaker's assistant, or perhaps
the undertaker's assistant's assistant.
The remaining roles to be filled are
the major part of the young Dr. Wilson,
who with Elaine helps furnish the love
| interest and also lends a hand in
straightening out the family difficulties,
and the minor parts of the undertaker's
assistant and his assistant. The next
tryout will be held tomorrow night,
July 4, at 7:30 o'clock in the Little
Theatre.
