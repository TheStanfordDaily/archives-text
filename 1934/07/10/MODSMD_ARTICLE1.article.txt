# Dr. Ryan Dies From Sudden Heart Attack
## Modern Thor, High Voltage Wizard, Mourned by Many Friends Study of Rower Problems Won World Fame 
### 
Dr. Harris J. Ryan, 08, professor
emeritus of the Stanford engineering
school and internationally known wiz
ard of electricity, died Tuesday night
at his home, 525 Embarcadero, of a
heart attack which occurred suddenly
during his recovery from a stroke suf
fered last April. Private funeral serv
ices were held Wednesday afternoon,
followed by cremation at Alta Mesa
cemetery Thursday. He is survived by
his widow, Katherine Fortenbaugh
Ryan, whom he married in 1888 at Hali
fax, Pa., and a younger brother, Lu
ther W. Ryan of Woodward, Pa.
Dr. Ryan was born January 8, 1860,
in Powells Valley, Pa. He was one of
the first graduates of the Cornell en
gineering school, winning his M.E. de
gree in 1887. He served on the Cornell
faculty until 1905, when he came to
Stanford. He received an LL.D. degree
from University of California in 1925.
Here at Stanford he earned a world
wide reputation for his research experi
ments, the success and brilliancy of
which resulted in an endowment fund
for the Harris J. Ryan High Voltage
Laboratory, erected in 1926. In this
laboratory, situated off the campus
toward Mayfield, he performed amaz
ing experiments with transmission of
power over long distances, and pro
duced lightning bolts of gigantic volt
age, subjecting their destructive power
to his will like a Merlin of electricity.
Experiments Practical
His research was not confined to the
realm of pure theory. Dr. Ryan's ex
periments usually have been directed
toward practical ends. He predicted, at
the time of building the laboratory, that,
in 10 years all water power in the San
Francisco Bay region capable of being
economically turned into electx-icity
would be in use. The problem of pro
ducing higher voltages that could be
sent great distances without too great
a loss was thus of great importance to
this district, and engrossed the atten
tion of Dr. Ryan and his associates.
Dr. Ryan also contributed toward the
discovery of the laws of corona on
high-voltage transmission lines, and
developed suitable types of insulation
for preventing power loss. He was the
first engineer in America to recognize
the cathode ray tube as a valuable ap
paratus for studying high-voltage ef
fects.
Colleagues Comment
The loss of Dr. Ryan will be a severe
blow to friends and students as well
as to the scientific world. Commenting
on his former colleague, Dr. Joseph S.
Carroll, associate director of electrical
engineering and acting director of the
Ryan laboratory, said: "Dr. Ryan waÂ£
one of the gentlest, most unselfish and
most generous of men. I have never
heard a student or anyone associated
with Dr. Ryan criticize him. When hon
ors came to him he always preferred to
give the lion's share to his assistants.
He was patient, tolerant, and earnest, a
man without personal enemies."
When Dr. Ryan retired from active
service in the university in 1931, P. O.
Crawford, '08, wrote of him in the Stan
ford Illustrated Review: "His concur
rent occupation in contemporary re
search gave Dr. Ryan's teaching an at
mosphere of breadth and vision that was
a continual joy to the student. . . . His
keen sense of business ethics has kept
him free of commercial bias so that his
counsel has been available to all. . . .
A sympathetic interest has made hi.s
sincere advice eagerly sought by grad
uates in times of difficulty. . . . Dr.
Ryan's career is a beautiful example of
co-operative spirit, pleasing personality,
and sheer ability, drawing men and
facilities to a worthy cause that Stan
ford might render greater service to
humanity. Mrs. Ryan shares honors
with her husband in a genuine human
interest in all former students, which
makes the Ryan hospitality a Stanford
tradition."
Dr. Ryan served variously as presi
dent, vice-president, and committee

member of the American Institute of
Electrical Engineers and as a member
of the American Association for the
Advancement of Scicnce. He was on the
jury of awards for the department of
electricity of the 1893 World's Fair ai
Chicago, was consulting engineer for
the Los Angeles Aqueduct Power Bu
reau from 1904 to 1924, delegate to the
International Electrical Congress at the
St. Louis Exposition in 1904, a member
of the jury of awards at the Panama-
Pacific International Exposition in 1915,
president of the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers and the Amer
ican Electro-Chemical Society, director
of the Anti-Submarine Supersonics
Laboratory of the National Research
Council of Pasadena during the war, and
member of the National Academy of
Science. He was also the author of a
number of textbooks, notably, "Devel
opments in Electric Power Transmis
sion."
In cxcavetions at the tomb of King
Zoser, an Egyptian monarch, who ruled
about 3000 8.C., elaborate beer mugs
were found.
