# Use of Objective Tests Defended By Prof. Kelly
## 
### 
Before a capacity audience in Room
14 of the Psychology Building, Pro
fessor Truman L. Keilcy yesterday
championed the. use of objective tests
as a means for improving a student's
preparation for social sciences and for
testing the trustworthiness of the social
sciences themselves.
In the presentation of his subject,
"Some Shortcomings in the Preparation
of Students for the Social Sciences,"
Dr. Kelley emphasized both the great
difference in the extent of preparation
which social science students have and
the present lack of proof to substantiate
hypotheses made in the social science
field. In urging better preparation of
students, and better methods of apply
ing the social sciences, Professor Kelley,
who is a summer visitor from Harvard,
argued that however unexact, the pres
ent methods for testing intelligence,
character, and other traits may be, the
vital necessity for having some notion
of these characteristics demands that
objective tests be continued and im
proved.
Contradicts Critics
Dr. Kelley, who, as an experienced
psychological advisor to the Committee
on the Teaching of Social Sciences,
commanded everyone's attention, de
cried the logic of those who would junk
objective tests on the claim that they
draw unnecessary comparisons between
individuals. Contradicting this argu
ment against objective testing, Dr. Kel
ley voiced the results of his own tests
of the mathematical background pos
sessed by beginning students entering a
university course in statistics. From
this he showed that undeniably the dif
ference in mathematical preparedness
between the best and the worst pre
pared is immense.
To determine the approximate level,
or median, among the students at which
the educational plan must be aimed,
Dr. Kelley continued, is the full justifi
cation for the use of objective tests.
Obviously, Dr. Kelley reasoned, educa
tion cannot be planned for the upper
10 per cent, the middle 35 per cent or
the lower 10 per cent alone; education
should meet the needs of all, and what
these needs are, and how to best mjet
them, is best determined through the
use of objective tests.
Tests Like Yardsticks
It was Dr. Kelley's further contention
that educators should no more rule
out the objective test for detecting dif
ferences in intelligence than they should
condemn the yardstick for discovering
differences in height. "There is nothing
wrong with the tests," was speaker Kel
ley's conclusion.
"The Analysis of Mental Life" will
be Dr. Kelley's subjcct today at 4:15
o'clock in Room 414, second floor of the
Psychology Building.
