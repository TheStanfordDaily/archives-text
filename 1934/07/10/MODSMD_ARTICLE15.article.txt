# Reverence for Learning
## 
### 
In pointing out that the universities are now the residuary legatees
of many of the spiritual values which were guarded by the church three
centuries ago, Harvard's President C'onant warns that the community of
citizens must have a true reverence for learning. "It is not sufficient,"
iie says, "to train investigators and scholars; a large body of influential
citizens must have a passionate interest in the growth of human knowl
edge."
There is some reason to believe that the prestige of the college pro
fessor has recently declined in the mind of the ordinary person. The
press attacks leveled against some of our academic forecasters of busi
ness in the early years of the depression and against "brain trusters" in
recent months .are not signs of reverence. The popularity of natural
science, on the other hand, has reached a climax in the I'nited States
although it is said to be declining in England and on the Continent.
Natural science will probably sustain its popularity in this country be
cause of its economic application, but the prestige of learning may rise
r>r fall with relation to the social gains that henceforth will be attributed
to it. In the immediate sense, learning may lean on politics, and. since
politics is primarily the art of the mobilization of popular emotions,
learning in America may come to occupy the precarious position that it
now does in Russia and Germany. In the long run, however, learning
cannot afford to become dependent on politics no matter how strong is
:he demand for scholars to abandon the classroom for the rostrum. The
function of the scholar ought to be eternally the same; namely, criticism,
constructive suggestion, and exploration.
