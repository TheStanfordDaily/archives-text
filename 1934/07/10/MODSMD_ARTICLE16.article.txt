# Stanford Golfers Want Credits
## 
### 
We arc extremely fortunate in having such an ideal golf course at
Stanford available to all members of the University. Especially during
the warm summer months does a "voting man's fancy lightly turn" â€”
to taking up the old golf game again. And yet with all the facilities and
. necessities right at hand there are no golf classes given during the
quarter.
Kven if it were impossible to give golf lessons to classes this summer,
it should at least be possible to give lower division students their re
quired credit in physical education for playing and practicing golf for
three or four hours a week. It is unfortunate that the University does
not encourage the game in this way during summer quarter. Certainly
there arc few other games which will give a person more pleasure and
recreation throughout his whole life than this one.
