LOVK IN A VILLAGE
Iti the Assembly Hall
Ln the first presentation outside of
England of Isaac BickerstafTs "Love
in a Village," the English Opera Play
ers hilariously interpreted the old
opera-ballad, much to the delight of a
Stanford audience in the Assembly Hall
Friday evening.
First presented in 1762, the sketch as
given contained all of the old time set
tings and lines. Formal and dignified
situations were accentuated to the point
of absurdity, making the ballad as en
tertaining a production as any other
presented on the campus in recent
years.
G. Marston Haddock was the pro
ducer, musical director, and leading
male character. G. Donald Gray was the
stage director, and Fred Stover exe
cuted the settings in the true 1762
manner.
Mr. Haddock, playing the part of
Young Meadows trying to avoid an ar
ranged marriage, was excellent. His
mannerisms and stage presence were
by far the best ever seen on the As
sembly Hall stage. His comedy and
grandiose gestures kept the audience
in gales of laughter.
G. Donald Gray shares with Had
dock the honors for making thus re
vival tremendously successful. Rosetta,
Dove Irene Kilgore, was sweet and
charming. Rosetta is also fleeing from
an arranged marriage. She and Young
Meadows fall in love as they work to
gether for a county justice, never re-;
ulizing that (hey were the two supposed
to marry in the first place.
An interesting sub-plot develops
around Rosetta's mistress, Lucinda,
played by Es(er Foli, as she plans an
elopement with Eustace, her lover.
The fastest comedy is made by I lodge

and Madge as two minor characters in
the play who vise slapstick methods of
laugh-getting, and cockney dialects.
The score has been arranged oy
George Whilaker from a copy of (he
original edition published in 17(i3.
Musieal arrangements for an accom
panying trio were made from the Whit
aker score by Alfred Scidel and Mr.
Haddock.
The successful attempts to popularize
these revivals by the English company
will do a great deal to gain bay district
support for their efforts.
