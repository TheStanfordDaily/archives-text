# HILLSBOROUGH SYMPHONY
## 
### 
At the Woodland Theatre
Using broad, imperious sweeps of the
arm and slight, insinuating gestures of
the hand, Fritz Reiner led the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra in the first
concert of the summer season Sunday
afternoon in the Woodland Theatre al
Hillsborough.
In Tschaikowsky's Fourth Symphony
Reiner was at his colorful best. He gave
the impression of sometimes fighting
and wrestling with the music, at other
times caressing and placating it. His
interpretation showed a deep insight
into the mood of the composer. A light,
deft touch gave a singing quality to the
smooth, melodic portions of the work,
while force and power communicated
itself to the climactic sections. He
made able and ingenious use of pause
and suspense, drawing out rests In the
music while he held himself and the
orchestra rigid, tense, and immobile.
The singing quality manifested it
self also in the Polka and Fugue from
the Czech opera "Schwanda, the Bag
pipe Player" by Jaromir Weinberger.
"Schwanda" Was first performed at
Prague in 1927 and since then has re

ceived over two thousand performances
in central Europe, which gives some
indication of its tremendous popularity.
The Polka and Fugue, heard at these
concerts for the first time, are from dif
fei'ent parts of the orchestral inter
ludes. Their swinging rhythms started
many a foot in the audience tapping
softly.
Amusing was the rendition of Richard
Strauss' "Till Eulenspiegel's Merry
Pranks," which the composer describes
as a tone poem "after the old-fashioned
roguish manner." The music is based on
an old folk-tale telling of a wandering
mechanic who is given to perpetrating
all kinds of practical jokes on all and
sundry. These jokes, according to
Strauss, ultimately bring Till to the
gallows. "Till" is one of a series of
tone poems of character study by
Strauss.
Also on the program were the pre
lude to "Die Meistersingcr," and Liszt's
symphonic poem, "Les Preludes."
Fritz Reiner conducts again at the
next concert on July 22, while Jose
Iturbi will direct the last two concerts
in the summer series.
