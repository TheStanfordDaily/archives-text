# CINDERELLA

Perry Dilley's little guignols, who re
cently gave the old story of Cinderella,
again prove that there is something ir
resistibly droll about puppets and that
both young and old succumb to their
lure.
Cinderella, herself, was quite as dainty
and charming as she should be, far from
the tearful victim that 'sat and pitied
herself while her cruel step-sisters had
a good time. The characterizations of
the step-sisters were drawn with biting
humor and the step-mother was -suffi
ciently dour.
The scene in which the step-sisters
try on the slipper, pushing and grunting,
was adroitly managed, and graceful was
the triumphant waltz of the Prince and
Cinderella.
Much of the dialogue was of 1934
vintage, and many scenes had been
modernized. The owners of the deft
fingers who operated the figurines be
longed to Grace Stearns and Grace
Wick man.
