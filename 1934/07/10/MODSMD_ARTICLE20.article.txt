# MORE CHOIR MEMBERS ASKED FOR BY ALLEN
## 
### 
The Reverend J. Howard Melish,
D.D., conducted his last service in the \
Memorial Church on Sunday. The or- '
gan recital was presented by Warren D. ;
Allen.
According to Allen, we are very â– 
fortunate in having such an accorn- I
plished choir this summer. It is now
composed of twenty members, but a few
more would be welcomed. Anyone who
is interested in joining should report to
rehearsals on Thursday nights at 7:30
in Room 84.
