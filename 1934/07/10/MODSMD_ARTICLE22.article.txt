Following another series of tryouts
for the campus production, "The Doc
tor's Wife," Harold Helvenston, direc
tor of Stanford dramatics, announces
that the two remaining masculine parts
have been cast.
Paul Crary, whose work in past Stan
lord drama will bring him readily to the
minds of local audiences, was given the
juvenile lead, the part of "Dr. Wilson."
After much competition, Crary was se
lected as being best qualified for the
part because of his successful record.
Some of his previous parts include that
of the "murderer" ih "Hawk Island," the
"trapper" in "Distant Drums," and
"PetkofT" in "Arms and the Man." In
addition he has participated in many
of the readings conducted by the
Sword and Sandals Club, Stanford
play-reading society.
Waldon Wilson, whose work un
der Helvenston in children's parts for
several years thoroughly qualified him,
was given the 13-year-old. part of
"Jimmy."
This casting completes the cast with
the exception of one or two very minor
personalities, undertaker's assistants.
Other masculine parts are "Doctor Har
ker," filled by William Gwinn, gradu
ate student; "Wilson Everett," taken by
Frank O'Neill, former business man
ager of the University of San Francisco
players. Feminine roles, previously cast,
include the ingenue "Elaine Harker,"
carried by Shelley Smith: "Mrs. Har
ker," to be impersonated by Dr. Mar
gery Bailey of the Stanford English
Department; and "the maid," which
role goes to Rosemary Sif.trom.
