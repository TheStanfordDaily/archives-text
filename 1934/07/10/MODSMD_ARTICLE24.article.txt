# ODEGARD ADVISES LOBBY USE AS AID FOR MAKING LAWS
## Says Failure to Make Use of Legitimate Lobbies Robs Efficiency 
### 
Addressing a large audience in the
Dange Studio of the Women's Gym
nasium last Thursday night, Professor
Peter H. Odegard, acting professor of
political science, spoke on "Some As
pects of Contemporary Politics."
After discussing some of the funda
mental aspects of the American govern
ment and pointing out several incidental
mechanical defects that have become
evident in the Constitution, Professor
Odegard stated that the time was now
over-ripe for a modification of the rep
resentative system. He knocked the
legislative actions of the last ten years,
pointing out the ever-growing influence
of the lobbyists who, he said, might be
referred to as "a third house of Con
gress."
Professor Odegard believes, however,,
that instead of deriding this practice, an
attempt should be made to make the
lobbyist a responsible part of the leg
islative machine, inasmuch as he has
drafted a good many of the bills passed
in the legislative bodies of the United
States. He pointed out that although
experts are necessary in the govern
ment, they are never elected.
Executive Has Free Rein
Continuing on the subject of legisla
tion, Dr. Odegard noted that more and
more of the legislative functions are
being assumed by the executive. Legis
lation is being drafted in general terms
giving the executive free rein to act
in the light of expert advice. Citing a
long list of acts giving greater freedom
of action to the executive, he said, "It
has been said that Congress has abdi
cated, but it has not. It has merely as
sumed the position a legislative body
should occupy."
Opening the subject of economic
planning, Professor Odegard noted that
other countries have more government
controlled industries than the United
States. After discussing what industries
the government should control and the
f methods by which it could be done, he
remarked that in his opinion the gov
ernment-owned corporation was supe
rior.
Courts Take Blame
Bringing out the fact that the courts
take a good deal of the blame which is
in reality due the legislature, Dr. Ode
gard stated, "The judges are the de
fenders of private rights against the
government. They check 'the govefn
fnent, they do not serve it. ... As a
matter of fact, the courts display more
economic wisdom than Congress."
Citing several opinions of justices of
the United States Supreme Court, Pro
fessor Odegard came upon one, ren
dered by Chief Justice Taft, from which
he deduced that as far as the Court
was concerned, state socialism was pos
sible under the Constitution. The
courts, he pointed out, present no ob
stacle to economic control.
