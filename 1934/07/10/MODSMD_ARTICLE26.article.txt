# SAYS ENVIRONMENT VITAL TO COLLEGE STUDENT OF TODAY

### 
Students learn by living as well as by |
academic study, said Dean Mary Yost j
in her talk on "Environment in College I
University Education" over KPO in the j
Stanford program last night.
"While the focus of a student's edu- i
cational experience in college is in his
academic work, yet the influence of his
total environment is very important in
determining what kind of a man or
woman he will turn out to be," declared
the Dean.
College guidance and help in the in
formal, organized, and social life of
the undergraduate, Dean Yost believes,
is one way in which the college can |
condition the environment of its stu- !
dents.
"The student publications and student i
dramatics offer opportunities for train
ing group co-openation and self-expres
sion which have genuine educational
value," said Dean Yost.
Building and running its own dormi
tories is the most direct and adequate
way by which a college can look after
the housing of its students, she affirmed.
"It seems inevitable that the colleges j
and universities all over the country J
will face more and more the fact that j
what they are working for in the class
room may be either interfered with by â– 
the environment outside the classroom
or strongly supported by it," Dean Yost !
predicted.
