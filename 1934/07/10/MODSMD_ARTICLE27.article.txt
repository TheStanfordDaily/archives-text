# Patty Baker Led to Alter in Stanford Church Saturday
## 
### 
It was not a crippled Patty Baker but
a very healthy and happy Patty who
walked down the aisle of the Memorial
Church to marry Karl Wheeler Karnopp
last Saturday.
Infantile paralysis threatened Miss
Baker's life when she was a student
here four years ago. Notwithstanding
her own condition, she twice gave her
blood as a serum to save other victims
of the disease.
Miss Baker is the daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. W. S. Baker of Winters. She
is a member of the Chi Omega sorority.
Karnopp is the son of C. F. Karnopp,
Chicago candy maker. He was grad
uated from Stanford in 1932.

Beer is the oldest known alcoholic
drink in the world.
Over 50 per cent of the students at
Stanford during the past year were at
least partially self-supporting.
