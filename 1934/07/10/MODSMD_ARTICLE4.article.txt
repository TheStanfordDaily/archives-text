# First Dance Date Is Set
## 
### 
Plans for an all-University jolly-up
to be held in the Women's Clubhouse
from 7 to 8 p.m. on Wednesday of next
week were being formed today by a
committee made up of members of
men's and women's councils.
With Marian Storey and Bob Grantier
in charge, the group was making efforts
to secure a suitable orchestra for the
event. Although the admission price
had not been set definitely, it probably
will be 10 cents a person, it was said.
The dance will be the fiist social func
tion on the campus this summer. Miss
Storey is arranging to have an adequate
number of women on hand to provide
partners for stags.
For the benefit of strangers on the
campus, jolly-ups are not date affairs.
More details will be announced soon,
it was said yesterday.
