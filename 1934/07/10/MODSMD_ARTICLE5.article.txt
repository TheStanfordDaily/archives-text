Dan Moscr and Don Edwards, room
mates, classmates, fraternity brothers
and pais, fought it out for the cham
pionship of the fourth annual Orinda
Galf and Country Club tournament.
These two Stanfordites met last Sun
day and Moser returned the victor, one
up, in the 36-hole final match. Edwards
saw the title he won last year slip
from his grasp when he three-putted
the final green.
