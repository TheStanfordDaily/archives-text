PHOTOLITH PRINTING
The Stanford University Press is now installing equipment for photolith printing, as a
necessary complement to our facilities for letterpress printing and for publication. It is ex-,
pected that actual production will start about August i.
This process has been given various trade names, but we feel that "photolith" beft ex
presses the underlying principle —printing on a lithographic offset press from a design pho
tographically transferred to a chemically etched plate. Existing prints from type, typewriting,
drawings, and photographs can be thus reproduced (reduced in size, same size, or enlarged)
without the use of type or letterpress printing plates, 'flic savings in coSt are quite marked,
particularly in the small edition field, and for some types of work there is an Actual improve
ment in quality.
'
The decision to equip for this work is the result of a careful investigation extending over
the pa.ft three years, and was influenced principally by the conviction that we could in no
other way render the complete printing and publication service to which this University and
the educational interests of the Pacific CoaSt are entitled. The success of the venture will be
governed by (r) our ability to produce a high quality of work at reasonable coft, and (2) the
degree of co-operation we receive from the Stanford faculty and others who are interested.
To assure the quality of work, we are purchasing the very beft types of equipment and
placing its operation in the hands of skilled people, who arc enthusiastic in promoting the
adaptation of this relatively new process to the requirements of university printing and pub
lishing. We anticipate that co-operation from our expected clientele will follow automati
cally upon our success in making good with respe<st to high quality and reasonable co£h
Mo.ft of the members of the Stanford faculty and summer student body are probably
familiar, at leaft in a general way, with this process of printing, and all such will recognize
immediately its adaptability to syllabus 'work, manuals, etc., which are ordinarily in some
form of typewriting reproduction. But photolith has a larger field than reproduction of
typewriting and we shall welcome the opportunity of demonstrating these advantages. De
partments and individuals arc accordingly invited to consult with us concerning printing
projects hitherto regarded as impracticable. Consultation should precede the preparation of
actual copy.
