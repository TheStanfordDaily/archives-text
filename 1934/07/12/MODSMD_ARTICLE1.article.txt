# Margery Bailey Wins Plaudits In "The Circle"
## Maugham's Comedy Reading Presented by Sword and Sandals Robert Brauns Amusing as Arnold 
### Philip Bernheim 
A problem-drama with an almost
farcical first act was W. Somerset
Maugham's "The Circle," presented last
night in the Little Theatre by Sword
and Sandals.
Acting honors were undoubtedly car
ried off by Dr. Margery Bailey in the
role of Lady Catherine Cheney. Her
first speech brought down the house
with laughter and applause. The part
might have been cast to her mold, so
perfectly did she fit it. Her character
ization was delightfully reminiscent of
some of her more sarcastic classroom
dissertations.
Brauns Amusing
Equally amusing was Robert Brauns
as Arnold, Lady Catherine's son. He
turned in his usual, and therefore ex
pected, performance of consummate
comedy.
Dorothy Tully's reading of Elizabeth,
Arnold's charming and romantic wife,
was very well done. Her use of facial
gesture was much more able and facile
than is usual at Stanford play-readings.
Baker Futany as Lord
Hugh Baker as gruff Lord Porteus was
especially funny when complaining over
non-fitting false teeth. These teeth
bothered him throughout the play, much
to the amused delight of the audience.
Although the play started on an hi
larious note, and maintained it through
out, it nevertheless had its serious mo
ments. Df. Bailey, Brauns, and Miss
Tully are all to be commended for the
way in which they managed the transi
tion from merriment to seriousness and
back to merriment again. The serious
moments were handled with a sincerity
of portrayal that put the final polish on
an excellent production.
Others in the cast, which was uni
formly and unusually good, were
Thomas Seller, Myna Hughes, and
Charles Denny. James McElncy read
the stage directions.
