# Negro Singer Wins Acclaim
## 
### 
A large, heartily-applauding audience
acclaimed the talents of Kenneth Spen
cer, colored bass singer who, with
Rosso Leßel as accompanist, performed
in the Dance Studio of the Women's
Gymnasium Tuesday evening.
Offering a variety of presentations,
including classical, negro spiritual, and
modern songs, Spencer completely cap
tured his audience with his voice and
personality. His clear pronunciation,
the controlled tonal power, and the art
ful handling of his voice given to both
high and low notes allowed his audience
to follow not only the melody but also
the word story of his songs.
An hour of condensed entertainment
was offered to all who attended, and
after listening to the presentation of
such soft, appealing songs as "Bitte" by
Franz, and "Passing By" by Purccll,
as well as the more stirring "Die Wan
derer" by Schubert, and "Swing Low
Sweet Chariot," the audience clamored
for more. So the singer returned to give
three encores: "There's No Hidin' Place
Down There," a snappy spiritual;
"Water Boy," and "Give Me that Old
Time Religion," a light, happy selection
which concluded the concert and had
the audience answering with .smiles
and laughs.
Singing "Swing Low Sweet Chariot'
without piano accompaniment, and fol
lowing with a reading, "Creation,
Spencer solicited one of the most hearty
responses of the evening from his lis
teners. Hardly less was the appreciation
showed for Rosso Lcßcl's piano solos,
"Love's Old Sweet Song," and an en
core written by the player, "An Afri
can Dance."
It was Spencer's versatility which
gave the audience its most apparent
pleasure. For in changing from class
ical which required voicing the high
est and most delicate notes, to modern
spirituals which required the utmost
depth and volume, Spencer stood out to
great advantage.
After the concert Spencer was intro
duced to many of his admirers by
members of the Stanford Public Exer
cises Committee, which staged the per
formance.
