# Letters At Library Shed Light On D. H. Lawrence
## 
### 
The character of a man whose books '
are barred from public libraries is al
most of as much interest as the books
themselves.
Though his books have failed to reach
the innermost sanctities of many a li
brary because they employ too many
"good old Anglo-Saxon words and
possess so many other prohibitive traits,
the personal letters of David H. Law
rence, written to his friends, Lady Otto
line, John Cournps, and others, supply
the most interesting feature among the
displays of the private correspondence |
of prominent authors now being ex
hibited in the library.
Recounting some of the trying expe
riences besetting his path as he moved
from place to place in England and on |
the Continent before and during the
Great War, Lawrence writes as on"
much bewildered and harassed, as one
unable to understand the immensity of |

the conflict raging about him.
He is very much a human, hating
being sick himself, and deeply con
cerned over the illness of his wife,
Frieda, niece of the German ace, Man r
frcd von Richthofen. Letters from Villfa
ncar Florence in Italy, reveal
all this to his friend Cournos.
Other of his letters, mostly from Zen
nor, St. Ives, Cornwall to Lady Ottolino
and Cournos, express his annoyance at
the invasion of troops .to inspect his
home, and his anxiety to be off for
Colombia, South America, in order to
escape the danger of war and the draft.
Additional letters reveal Lawrence
the considerate friend purchasing fur
niture for another with great discrimi
nation. Again, his letters picture him
the intellectual philosopher pursuing
his study and urging the subject on his
friends. Lawrence later migrated to
Taos, New Mexico. He died in France
in 1030.
