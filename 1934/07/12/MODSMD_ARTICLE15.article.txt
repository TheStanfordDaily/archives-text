# Tennis Players Start Matches; Handball Next
## 
### 
The University Tennis Tournament is
now under way, and Coach Harry Ma
loney urges the men entered to go to
the gym and note the opponents they
arc scheduled to play. He is anxious
for players to get in touch with each
other and play their matches as soon
as possible, so that the tournament can
be completed without delay.
The drawing for the handball tourna
ment will be held tomorrow, and thnt
tournament will start next week. No
one will be allowed to enter after this
Friday.
There are now enough men to form
two teams in the volley ball class, but
anyone who still wishes to enter will
be welcome.
