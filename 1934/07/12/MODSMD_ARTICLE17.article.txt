# Slump Favors Big Business, Crum Reveals
## Small Corporations Suffer More in Depression, Report Shows Visiting Harvard Economist Quotes Own Bulletin 
### 
In a research study on the effect of
size on corporate earnings and condi
tions, Harvard's W. L. Crum, now at
Stanford, in his report "shows a sig
nificant tendency for larger corpora
tions to have a higher return on their
gross business than smaller corpora
tions; for larger corporations to have a
smaller rate of loss on their net worth,
in a year of deep depression like 1931,
than smaller corporations."
The recently published report in
cludes only the calendar and fiscal year
of 1931, and was published by the Har
vard Business School as a research
bulletin.
Good Depression Picture
The striking findings of the research
give a remarkable picture of corporate
conditions at a time of severe depres
sion.
In continuing, the bulletin stales:
"In considering these findings as
well as various other findings of this
study, it is necessary to take into con
sideration the important possibility
that certain types of industrial activi
ty—within any particular industrial
division or group—may tend to be
handled by smaller corporations while
other types tend to be handled by
larger corporations. "
In considering the finding of a
smaller rate of loss to the larger cor
porations than to the smaller ones in
1931, the study adds "there were some
instances in which groups of corpora
tions showing a net profit, instead of
loss, appeared to follow a correspond
ing rule: larger corporations appeared
to have a higher rate of profit on their
net worth than smaller corporations."
