# Occupations—New and Old
## 
### 
A great deal of serious effort is 1 )c*in<*" devoted today to tlie study cjf
a choice of occupations, and doubtless new approaches will be worked
out bv experts in vocational guidance. For example, Dr. Harold I\
Clark, of Columbia I'niversity, bas recently stressed the importance of
finding some method of determining what is the correct number of people
to have in any occupation from the social standpoint. He concludes that
occupational distribution is correct when people of the same ability re
reive the same wages in all occupations. Applying this principle to the
collected evidence that there are thousands of people in the skilled trades
who have the same ability as lawyers, he asserts that more people in the
skilled trades ought to be directed into law until the income in law is no
larger than the income these same people would receive in any other
lield. In 1931, it was estimated that the average annual earnings in law
were $5,250, as compared with $1,800 in the skilled trades. These figures
would seem to contradict the theory that America is providing equal
opportunity.
This principle'—that a correct occupaitonal distribution ensues when
people of the same ability receive the same wages in all occupations—
ignores, as Dr. Clark readily admits, the observation that the professions
are at present overcrowded. From the standpoint of the people alreadv
in these professions, too many are now engaged in them. A frequent
complaint in all professions is that .earnings arc too low. This may be
understood, of course, when one considers the numerous lawyers at the
bottom of the profession as compared with the leaders of the bar. This
explains the average annual earnings. Yet there is no simple solution
through changing occupations. The average annual earnings in law and
medicine are about $5,250 and there is no occupation which reports
higher average earnings. A college graduate who expects to earn the
average salary in an occupation may aim for the average in law; but if
he should be a better teacher than a lawyer, he might possibly earn more
as a teacher than as a lawyer.
We may look for some solution to the problem if college graduates
will consider striking out in new fields instead of viewing only the ready
made occupations. For example. Dr. Arthur E. Morgan, chairman of
the TV A and former president of Antioch College, lists a few new
occupations. Ife suggests that certain kinds of work are being done in
efficiently and that certain work needs to be done that is not now done
at all. There is room; lie points out, for a thousand young men to make
themselves expert in preventing soil erosion, and a new occupation that
needs development is irrigation engineering, lie suggests further the
development of new service occupations in which those engaged would
receive pay for helping other persons with their personal problems.
Along this line, women would find opportunity for building up a busi
ness of caring for other people's children and entertaining young people
in community centers, and young men could develop the profession of
safety engineering in a number of small towns.
Much more effort than is at present noticeable could be devoted to
studying the choice of occupations.

collected evidence that there are thousands of people in the skilled trades
who have the same ability as lawyers, he asserts that more people in the
skilled trades ought to be directed into law until the income in law is no
larger than the income these same people would receive in any other
lield. In 1931, it was estimated that the average annual earnings in law
were $5,250, as compared with $1,800 in the skilled trades. These figures
would seem to contradict the theory that America is providing equal
opportunity.
This principle'—that a correct occupaitonal distribution ensues when
people of the same ability receive the same wages in all occupations—
ignores, as Dr. Clark readily admits, the observation that the professions
are at present overcrowded. From the standpoint of the people alreadv
in these professions, too many are now engaged in them. A frequent
complaint in all professions is that .earnings arc too low. This may be
understood, of course, when one considers the numerous lawyers at the
bottom of the profession as compared with the leaders of the bar. This
explains the average annual earnings. Yet there is no simple solution
through changing occupations. The average annual earnings in law and
medicine are about $5,250 and there is no occupation which reports
higher average earnings. A college graduate who expects to earn the
average salary in an occupation may aim for the average in law; but if
he should be a better teacher than a lawyer, he might possibly earn more
as a teacher than as a lawyer.
We may look for some solution to the problem if college graduates
will consider striking out in new fields instead of viewing only the ready
made occupations. For example. Dr. Arthur E. Morgan, chairman of
the TV A and former president of Antioch College, lists a few new
occupations. Ife suggests that certain kinds of work are being done in
efficiently and that certain work needs to be done that is not now done
at all. There is room; lie points out, for a thousand young men to make
themselves expert in preventing soil erosion, and a new occupation that
needs development is irrigation engineering, lie suggests further the
development of new service occupations in which those engaged would
receive pay for helping other persons with their personal problems.
Along this line, women would find opportunity for building up a busi
ness of caring for other people's children and entertaining young people
in community centers, and young men could develop the profession of
safety engineering in a number of small towns.
Much more effort than is at present noticeable could be devoted to
studying the choice of occupations.
A great deal of serious effort is 1 )c*in<*" devoted today to tlie study cjf
a choice of occupations, and doubtless new approaches will be worked
out bv experts in vocational guidance. For example, Dr. Harold I\
Clark, of Columbia I'niversity, bas recently stressed the importance of
finding some method of determining what is the correct number of people
to have in any occupation from the social standpoint. He concludes that
occupational distribution is correct when people of the same ability re
reive the same wages in all occupations. Applying this principle to the
collected evidence that there are thousands of people in the skilled trades
who have the same ability as lawyers, he asserts that more people in the
skilled trades ought to be directed into law until the income in law is no
