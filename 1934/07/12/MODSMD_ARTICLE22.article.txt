# Let's Try Cheaper Shows
## 
### 
Once, long ago, students from the university were admitted to the
shows in Paly for two-bits (25 cents) upon presentation of a student
body card. They can still get in for 25 cents if they wish. But it costs
40 cents to sit on the lower floor which is practically empty anyway.
Many students stay away from the show because they haven't got
the forty cents to sit downstairs and don't enjov the show sitting upstairs.
The theatres would gain more student patronage if they would bring the
suident rate back to the old standard.
We realize the theatres have lost business because of the polio epi
demic fear, but we also think it would be to their advantage as much as
to ours to bring back the old student rate. They seldom get more than
25 cents out of a student anyway, so it would be to their advantage to
have more of those 25-cent pieces.
