# LITTLE AWARDED BLOCK "S" LETTER
## 
### 
W. Lawson Little, Jr., British ama
teur golf champion, was awarded a
varsity letter by the Board of Athletic
Control at a dinner and reception given
in his honor at the Fairmont hotel
Tuesday night. Although golf is a minor
sport at Stanford, the major sport letter
was awarded for the second time to an
athlete proving exceptionally proficient
in a minor sport.
On being interviewed over station
KFRC last night, the prominent Stan
ford golfer attributed his success to the
training given him by Tommy Armour,
Larry Brazil, and Coach Eddie Twiggs
of Stanford; also to the proper atmos
phere pi'ovided by his competitors and
the golf fans of England.
Little urged his listeners to dispel any
of their illusions that he was the equal
of the great Robert Tyre Jones, point
ing out that np player has ever ap
proached Jones' consistency.
In presenting the Block "S" Almon E.
Roth said, "Lawson's splendid deport
ment during his entire stay in England
is as much the reason for his being
given the Stanford "S" as was his golf
prowess.

Approximately half a million people
commute to their jobs in New York
City each day.
