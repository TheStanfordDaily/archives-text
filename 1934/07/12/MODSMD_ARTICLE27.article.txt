# UNIVERSITY PRESS INSTALLS MODERN OFFSET MACHINE
## New Equipment Reproduces Drawings without Use of Plates 
### 
The Stanford University Press is now
completing arrangements for the pro
duction of photolith printing, as a nec
essary complement to its facilities for
letterpress printing and for publication.
According to Will A. Friend, manager
of the Stanford Press, decision to equip
for this work is the result of a careful
investigation extending over the last
three years, and was influenced prin
cipally, by the conviction that the press
could in no other way render the com
plete printing and publication service to
which this University and the educa
tional interests of the Pacific Coast are
entitled.
Photolith printing is a process which
reproduces existing prints from type,
typewriting, drawings, and photographs
in reduced, same, or enlarged sizes,
without the use of type or letterpress
printing plates. The latest model of
Harris lithographic offset press is now
being installed in the pressroom. Quar
ters for the plate-making department,
including dark room, developing tanks,
etc.,- have been practically completed by
the University mechanics, and will be
ready for installation of the camera and
other plate-making equipment now on
the way from the eastern factories.
Lithographic offset printing, from the
standpoint of actual presswork, has
been in use about 30 years, but only in
recent years has taken place the rad
ical developments in plate-making
which make the process adaptable to
general commercial printing. The out
standing improvement came from the
use of the camera, whereby there is
transferred to the printing plate (a thin
sheet of zinc which clamps around one
of the press cylinders) a faithful repro
duction of printed matter, typing,
drawings, photographs, etc. The process
is rapid, economical in labor and mate
rial costs, an improvement in quality,
and especially adapted to the small edi
tion field of university work.
Photolith printing will be of great aid
in the printing of syllabus work, man
uals, etc., which are ordinarily in some
form of typewriting.
It is expected that everything will be
ready for starting actual production
about August 1. However, just as soon
as installation is completed and the
Press is ready for production an an
nouncement will be made, and visitors
will be very welcome to witness the
actual printing.
