# REHEARSALS FOR "DOCTOR'S WIFE" NOW BEING HELD
## Director Helvenston Selects Cast for August 3 Production 
### 
All roles are filled and rehearsals are
now actively under way for the world
premiere, the Stanford production of
Eric Linders' new play, "The Doctor's
Wife." This original play, in four acts,
which will be presented on Friday eve
ning, August 3, will attempt to depict,
in comedy form, the inside life of a
doctor's household, and the trials and
tribulations thereof. Eric Linders, the
author, is himself a practicing physician
and should be well qualified to describe
this phase of the work he has chosen
for a life occupation.
Harold Helvenston, Stanford dramatic
director, who is directing the new play,
has succeeded in finding for the va
rious roles amateur actors whose past
reputations and recognition promises
that the play will be excellently cast.
The major roles and the cast now in
rehearsal are as follows: Mrs. Harker,
the doctor's wife and the feminine lead,
Dr. Margery Bailey of the Stanford
English department; Dr. Harker, the
harassed doctor who is finally drugged
and tricked into ludicrously abandon
ing his practice of old women with
imaginary ailments, William Gwinn,
graduate student of public speaking;
Dr. Wilson, the young doctor who ar
rives on the scene early in the play and
ultimately furnishes his part of the love
interest, Paul Crary, well known for
past Stanford dramatic work; Elaine
Harker, ingenue daughter of the Har
ker family who will furnish the other
half of the love interest, Shelley Smith,
who is best remembered for her work
in "Three Cornered Moon"; Wilson Ev
erett, a neurotic financier and asserted
former suitor of Mrs. Harker, and who
finally proves himself highly instru
mental in solving the family difficulties,
and who, more than all, is expected to
furnish much of the comedy situation
with his suspectedly imaginary ulcer
ated stomach and brilliantly illustrated
chart thereof, Frank O'Neill, radio play
wright and former business manager of
the University of San Francisco players;
Jimmy, 13-year-old son of the family,
Waldron Wilson, an off-campus youth
of dramatic reputation; and, the maid,
Rosemary Sistrom.
In addition there are two parts, those
jof the undertaker and his assistant,
which are of secondary importance. All
of the major roles above mentioned are
filled by players well known to mem
j bers of the campus for their dramatic
I talent.
