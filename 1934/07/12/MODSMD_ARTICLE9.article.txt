### 
Recently returned from a vacation
trip high into the Sierras, Dr. Ray Ly
man Wilbur yesterday revealed to the
Daily that applications for admission
into the lower division for the fall quar
ter have brought the level up to the
normal quota of 1929 and 1930.
There will be more women next quar
ter also, he showed. The total should
number between 750 and 800.
Dr. Wilbur said that the 1934 summer
enrollment was a 5 per cent increase
over the registration for 1933's same
period.
Asked whether the general increase
was due to either business improve
ments or the university's new scholar
ship ruling, the President answered that
both were of influence but that it was
mainly caused by the decision of par
ents that a college education is the least
they can do for their children.
The President admitted not only
catching his share of fish in the moun
tains last week, but also that he always
has good luck in the Sierra trout
streams.
