# Farm Denizens Will Cavort At First Jolly-Up
## Women's Clubhouse Is Scene of Summer's Opening Social Event Ten Cents Admits to Dance And Games 
### Stull Powell 
Stanford "roughs" and co-eds will
trip the light fantastic to the melodious
strains of George Webstet's four-piece
Woodside Country Club Band as the
first Jolly-up of the summer quarter
launches the Sons and Daughters of
the Stanford Red into the dizzy whirl of
the summer social season tomorrow
night from 7 to 8 at the Women's Club
house.
No Date Affair
A custom on the Farm of long stand
ing makes it unnecessary to dust off
the other seat on the tandem bicycle,
because the "rough" doesn't date to
Jolly-ups. The co-eds not only walk
home from the dance, but must walk
to the dance, that is unless they have
their own bicycles, but then Nature
usually tends to this matter in her
age-old way.
For the benefit of those who are
bashful or had their toes badly used
during the last dance, the committee
in charge is planning on installing the
equipment for several games of skill
in an adjacent room to that used for
dancing.
Plenty of Women
The committee wishes to reassure the
men who have been frightened by re
cent reports as to the scarcity of women
interested in pursuing their education
during the summer by informing them
that in addition to the local charmers
a number of off-campus women will be
present. This event is to be an all-
University affair and the committee
expects a record turn-out of both men
and women. It is reported to be an
excellent chance to meet the "blonde"
who sits in the front of the class be
cause it is strictly informal and none
of the "roughs" will have any priority
claims.
Chapcroncs Named
Chaperoning the dance will be Dr.
and Mrs. E. G. Mears and Dr. and Mrs.
H. J. Rathbun.
Since the dance is to be of only an
hour's duration, from seven until eight
o'clock, everyone is urged to be prompt
in order to gain the most from the ad
mittance fee, which is the slight sum
of ten cents
