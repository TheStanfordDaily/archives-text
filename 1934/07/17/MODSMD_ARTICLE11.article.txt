# Stanford Out of Danger As General Strike Hits
## Large Supplies of Foodstuffs and Gasoline on Hand; Local Transportation and Building Activities Are Normal as Strife Continues 
### 
All is near normal at Stanford. That was the word from every section of the
campus yesterday as San Francisco's general strike began to have a paralytic
reaction on commercc of the Bay area.
In most cases absolutely no effect, except fear, had been felt, and in other cases
it was said that at the worst only slightly changed conditions would exist on the
campus-.

Stanford's food supply, the biggest
worry in many people's minds, is not
in any jeopardy, according to Miss
Christine Ricker, director of the Union.
Ample meat provisions have been stored
in the huge ice box, and perishables,
such as vegetables, fruit, milk, and
eggs, were being delivered locally with
out interference.
Managers of the campus summer
tables were experiencing little difficulty
and were not worried in the least. A
temporary delay in the arrival of meat
yesterday morning caused some worry,
but suitable arrangements soon were
made, and meat could be bought along
the peninsula.
Plenty of Gasoline
There will be plenty of gasoline for
campus automobiles, according to Bill
Stark, manager of the Campus Service
Station, who anticipated no difficulty
in handling the normal run of trade
here. Stark said that his station carries
enough fuel to last through two days of
rush trade and through nearly four days
of average business, and, barring trans
portation difficulties caused by a short
age of railroad tank cars, his storage
tanks will be refilled daily.
Lagunita Court, new women's dormi
tory under construction here, will not
be delayed at the moment, according to
George Walker, building contractor for
the job. "We can't tell just what the
effect will be," Walker .said yesterday,
"but we are keeping schedule at pres
ent."
Roy H. Button, superintendent of
buildings and grounds, said that his
department "in no way" was bothered
by the frozen commercial conditions.
Palo Alto Busses to Keep On
Transportation facilities were un
touched, so far as could be learned.
The Palo Alto Transit, operator of the
j local bus line, said that regular service
was being maintained by the gasoline
j companies and that a six-day supply
[ was constantly on hand to carry the
i company over any temporary shortage.
Regular schedules were to be main
tained.
The Pacific Greyhound and Southern
Pacific lines were "not anticipating
any difficulty," although local officers
did not know if their San Francisco
fuel supplies were diminishing.
All in all, things were normal on the
Farm. Every necessity is available, and
unless things become much more acute
than they were last night there will be
no need for anxiety.
The effect of the strike was primarily
limited to local entertainment circles
when it was discovered that two mem
bers of the orchestra that is to play for
the Jolly-up Wednesday night were
union men and were on a strike. The
leader of the band assures the Jolly-up
committee, however, that he can secure
two substitutes.

Dr. L. S. Rowe, director general of the
Pan American Union, who was a le
turer in political science at Stanford last
summer quarter, sailed Saturday for
Colombia. He plans to return in five
weeks.

the peninsula.
Plenty of Gasoline
There will be plenty of gasoline for
campus automobiles, according to Bill
Stark, manager of the Campus Service
Station, who anticipated no difficulty
in handling the normal run of trade
here. Stark said that his station carries
enough fuel to last through two days of
rush trade and through nearly four days
of average business, and, barring trans
portation difficulties caused by a short
age of railroad tank cars, his storage
tanks will be refilled daily.
Lagunita Court, new women's dormi
tory under construction here, will not
be delayed at the moment, according to
George Walker, building contractor for
the job. "We can't tell just what the
effect will be," Walker .said yesterday,
"but we are keeping schedule at pres
ent."
Roy H. Button, superintendent of
buildings and grounds, said that his
department "in no way" was bothered
by the frozen commercial conditions.
Palo Alto Busses to Keep On
Transportation facilities were un
touched, so far as could be learned.
The Palo Alto Transit, operator of the
j local bus line, said that regular service
was being maintained by the gasoline
j companies and that a six-day supply
[ was constantly on hand to carry the
i company over any temporary shortage.
Regular schedules were to be main
tained.
The Pacific Greyhound and Southern
Pacific lines were "not anticipating
any difficulty," although local officers
did not know if their San Francisco
fuel supplies were diminishing.
All in all, things were normal on the
Farm. Every necessity is available, and
unless things become much more acute
than they were last night there will be
no need for anxiety.
The effect of the strike was primarily
limited to local entertainment circles
when it was discovered that two mem
bers of the orchestra that is to play for
the Jolly-up Wednesday night were
union men and were on a strike. The
leader of the band assures the Jolly-up
committee, however, that he can secure
two substitutes.

Dr. L. S. Rowe, director general of the
Pan American Union, who was a le
turer in political science at Stanford last
summer quarter, sailed Saturday for
Colombia. He plans to return in five
weeks.
All is near normal at Stanford. That was the word from every section of the
campus yesterday as San Francisco's general strike began to have a paralytic
reaction on commercc of the Bay area.
In most cases absolutely no effect, except fear, had been felt, and in other cases
it was said that at the worst only slightly changed conditions would exist on the
campus-.

Stanford's food supply, the biggest
worry in many people's minds, is not
in any jeopardy, according to Miss
Christine Ricker, director of the Union.
Ample meat provisions have been stored
in the huge ice box, and perishables,
such as vegetables, fruit, milk, and
eggs, were being delivered locally with
out interference.
Managers of the campus summer
tables were experiencing little difficulty
and were not worried in the least. A
temporary delay in the arrival of meat
yesterday morning caused some worry,
but suitable arrangements soon were
made, and meat could be bought along
the peninsula.
