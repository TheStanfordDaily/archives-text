# Don't jump at Conclusions
## 
### 
In times of controversy and conflict when opposing groups are
striving for comparative advantage, there is a tendency for many people
to make snap judgments and to jump at conclusions, K specially is this
true when the various bodies in the struggle disseminate propaganda in
favor of themselves in an effort to influence public opinion. The educated
or trained mind looks beyond the mass of conflicting material which
accompanies an argument, and attempts to delve into the problem in
search of the truth.
It is this type of open mind, carefully weighing available evidence,
that is essential to an accurate and sane judgment of the San Francisco
situation. The wealth of propaganda distributed by both sides of the
struggle makes correct conclusions difficult and emphasizes the necessity
of maintaining an open mind to the relative values of the claims of either
side.
Dogmatism is the forte of the ignorant and biased mind. Rarely does
the educated person accept the most apparent conclusions from a super
ficial study of the facts. Rather, the intelligent individual accepts both
sides of the argument and leaves dogma to those who are qualified
through a study of the question to pass judgment.
