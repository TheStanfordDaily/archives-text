Arthur Sears Kenning, Washington representative of the Chicago
Tribune, predicts that when the latest legislation of the national relief
policy is put into effect, at least half of the population of the United
States will be receiving support in some form or other from the national
government.
If this prediction comes true — which we doubt very much — how
could families afford to send their children to institutions of higher
learning? Since all this relief money is being doled out, it seems a mis
t.ake, to forget the education of the present generation who arc being
deprived of a college education through no fault of their own.
The loans, emergency relief, drought relief, and public construction
work seem to be constructive relief programs, but it would be just as
constructive to send the thousands of young men and women to college
instead of to work. During their period in school big business and
industry would have a chance to recover, and could then make a place
for the well trained men and women of the nation.
