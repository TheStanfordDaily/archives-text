# Stanford Radio Hour
## 
### 
At 7:45 o'clock last night those vvlio took their minds off the strike
news stories to time in on Station KPO for a ((iiarter of an hour were
rewarded by Dr. J. S. Davis' interesting and intelligent discussion of
"Planned Agriculture I'ndcr the A.A.A." The talk wis one of the
ablest expositions of the inception and administration of the Agricultural
Adjustment Act that that piece of legislation has had.
Politically minded auditors might have expected the former chief
economist of the Federal Farm Hoard to be severely critical of the
A.A.A. wherever the opportunity offered. Such a thought, however,
never occurs to the usual members of a university community because
of their impregnation with the scientific attitude. It is this fact which
makes the Stanford radio hour so helpful. Listeners can be assured that
no propaganda —even subtle advertising of the University itself—ever
gets into the discussions. Because of its value to the radio industry the
Stanford hour lias been continued in the broad NI>C network since last
January after a brief trial last autumn. It is appreciated by radio
listeners in many states. The Stanford section of the audience could
well be one hundred per cent of the University community.
And in that connection, we mention the talk on the evening of July 30
to be presented by Professor Lowell Turrentine, of the Law School, on
"Auto Accidents: Commission Instead of Court."
