# STANFORD INITIATES NO FLUNKING RULE IN FALL QUARTER
## 
### 
Stanford's latest experiment with ed
ucational innovations will be ushered
in the coming autumn quarter when the
"no flunk" rule for upper division and
graduate students is invoked.
To summer quarter students not
planning to continue their work at the
University during the 1934-35 academic
year the new rule will have only the
interest of an experiment in education.
Students remaining for further work
will be directly affected.
Stating that every student who has
completed lower division requirements
is no longer subject to scholarship limi
tations, the new rule is designed to free
the advanced worker from worry over
the details of grading. It is supposed
that the greater freedom will permit
more intensive as well as more diversi
fied activity in academic lines.
Contrary to common belief the stu
dent finishing 90 units of credit does
not automatically come under the juris
diction of the new rule. For the student
must not only complete 90 units; but
these 90 units must include all science,
physical education, and other require
ments of the lower division. In addi
tion, beginning autumn quarter this
work must be completed with a straight
C average.
Nor is it true that an upper division
or graduate student failing to receive
passing grades is automatically elimi
nated from study in his major depart
ment. The departments themselves are
given freedom to decide if their majors
may continue work. Failing to be
granted readmission to his major, the
upper division student may transfer to
another department if that department
will accept him.
The practice of sending notice to the
student and his parents when grades
are received which under the old rul
ing would have meant flunking out or
probation will be continued, according
to Mrs. Huston of the Scholarship Com
mittee. .
It is expected by champions of the
new deal in grading that particularly
the man seeking the liberal, well
rounded education will be free to pur
sue the many lines of work which may
interest him, other than his major, with
out sacrificing his standing in the Uni
versity.
