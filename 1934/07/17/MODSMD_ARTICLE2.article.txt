# STANFORD ATHLETES ACTIVE IN NATION'S SPORTS LAST WEEK
## 
### 
Sporting worlds the past week-end
felt the impress of Stanford athletes
campaigning for championships in local,
national, and foreign fields, as the Uni
versity's golfers, racket - swingers,
swimmers, and track men continued
their summer activities; while pros
pects for next year's sport teams ap
peared brighter, according to reports
from Stanford coaches and other sport
experts.
In track and field John Lyman car
ried the name of Stanford to victory
by capturing the discus throw, one of
the three first places taken by the
American track squad against the Ger
man team Sunday. The same day
Chuck Otis, Stanford's varsity tennis
captain, won the Colorado state tennis
championship at Denver by defeating
the local champ, Vernon John, 4-6, 4-6,
6-3, 6-3, 6-3. It was an Indian victory
over Troy, as John is a Southern Cali
fornia student. On top of this came
Verne "Spec" Stewart's spectacular
battle in nosing out veteran Chick Ev
ans on the thirty-seventh green in the
Western Amateur Golf championship
at Oklahoma City, Saturday, to fall,
however, before the ultimate champion,
Zcll Eaton.
Little Selected for Tournament
Lawson Little, paired with Charles
Ferrera against Ernie Pieper and Ben
Coltrin, could not, even by tying the
course record with a round of 67, com
bat the double brilliancy of his oppo
nents and lost the match, but won for
San Jose the right to be represented
by a four-man team in the National
Public Links Golf Tournament, to be
held in Pittsburgh late this month.
Added to the bright present, was
Coach Nort Thornton's prediction that
his swimming and water-polo teams,
for the coming season, would be the
best in years. The return of outstand
ing stars like Captain - elect Foster,
American record holder at 440 yards
breast-stroke; Jack Kuhn, a man ca
pable of well under 2:20 minutes for
220 yards free-style; Alec McKenzie,
second place winner in Sunday's Pa
cific A.A.U. 100-meter free-style for
juniors; and Jim Triolo, veteran sprint
er, would in itself insui'e Stanford of
a first rate team, Thornton pointed out.
Aquatic Prospects Good
In addition, the world reaord holder
at 400 meters backstroke, George Walk
er, will be eligible, as will Bill Rogers
Jr., Clemo and Sutherland, two Long
Bcach Junior College transfers; Ben
Voss and Bob Hoover, former frosh;
and Bob Haslacher, a swimmer who
threatens to remove Captain Leo Cook
of the water polo squad from his posi
tion as goalie. It was Coach Thornton's
opinion that his galaxy of back-sti'oke
stars, including Rogers, new-comers
Etinning and Walker, and returning
veterans, Meyer, Bergman, and Fitting,
were capable of approaching American
and world records for all of the back
stroke relays.

A study by the American Council of
Education recently ranked twenty-three
of Stanford's graduate schools among
the first graduate schools in the uni
versities of the United States. The de
partments of Chemistrjj, (Education,
Geology, and Psychology received out
standing recognition.
