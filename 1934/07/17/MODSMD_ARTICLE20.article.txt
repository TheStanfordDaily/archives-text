### 
Sun-bathers at Encina Pools early
yesterday afternoon were treated to the
rare sight of watching three National
A.A.U. swimming champions, Jack Me
dica, A1 Wande Weghe, and Art High
land.
Stopping off en route to Japan where
they will meet the Orientals who have
dominated swimming since the 1932
Olympics, the three athletes were
guided about the campus by Nort
Thornton, Stanford swimming mentor.
In the touring party was the Yale swim
ming coach who is supervising the trip
to Japan.
Practice in the pools was evidently
the regular daily w&rkout for the cham
pions as all three, Medica in particular,
exerted strenuous effort. The Univer
sity of Washington student who holds
nine world records maintained a re
lentless pace for almost a full half hour
without stopping.
