# Dr. von Klenze Gives Views On 'Purged' Germany
## 
### 
Discounting all rumors of an im
pending downfall for the present Nazi
regime in Germany, Dr. Camillo von
Klenze, acting executive head of Stan
ford's German department, yesterday
ventured the assertion that "it is safe
to conclude that the Nazis and their
chief are more firmly established in
power than ever before,"
Dr. von Klenze knew personally many
of the principals figuring in recent Ger
man news, including the late Ernst
Roehm, quondam party chieftain.
"In taking decisive action," said the
German savant, "Chancellor Hitler
probably merely freed the Nazi party
from elements that might have proved
dangerous not only to the party, but to
the peace of Germany."
Dr. von Klenze pointed out that Ger
many had some thirty political parties
prior to the advent of Hitler. Hitler has
welded them into political homogeneity;
has averted civil war; and set up a to
talitarian, unified state, the aims of
which are entirely pacific. The pro
fessor concluded by observing that if
the government of Der Fuehrer should
fall, it would mean chaos in Germany,
which would entail chaos in Europe.
