# SAVERY LECTURES ON MODERN PHILOSOPHY
## 
### 
Professor William Savery, acting pro
fessor of philosophy, in a talk in the
Dunce Studio of the Women's Gymna
sium last Thursday night reviewed the
contributions made by Americans to
philosophy.
Dr. Savery discussed the philosophies
of the more noted American contribu
tors such as Dewey, Peirce, and James.
In his talk he covered pragmatism, the
new theory of knowledge; neutralism,
the new realism; the chain theory of
the universe, the new plui'alism; ty
chism, the doctrine of objective chance;
and evolutionary naturalism as a theo
retical philosophy and a way of life.
Himself a contributor to philosophy in
numerous articles, Professor Savery
paid tribute to Dr. Harold Chapman
Brown and to Dr. Henry Waldgrave
Stuart, professors of philosophy at Stan
ford, for their contributions.
Dr. Savery brought out that pragma
tism is a philosophy of the last century,
having been initiated by James in 1885.
Since then it has been studied and
contributed to by numerous contem
porary philosophers.
A visiting professor at Stanford this
year, Professor Savery has served as
professor "and chairman of the philoso
phy department of the University of
Washington since 1902, and has taught
at Harvard, University of California,
Oregon, and Stanford in previous years.
