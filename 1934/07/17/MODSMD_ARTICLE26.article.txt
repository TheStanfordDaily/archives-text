# STRESSES NEED FOR SCHOOL OF MUSIC
## 
### 
A music program is essential to round
out the cultural and educational cur
riculum of any college, according to
Warren D. Allen, University organist
and head of the music department.
Stanford has never really had music
courses that could he offered to the
general class of students until last win
ter quarter when instruction was given
in music fundamentals and some of the
more elementary fields.
Repeated in Spring
These courses were offered again
spring quarter, and the classes were so
well attended that Allen would like to
establish a permanent School of Music
at Stanford.
There is a more varied study of music
being given at the University this sum
mer quarter than ever before. The
courses in the study of Bach and Bee
thoven were inspired by the work of
the Belgian Pro Arte Quartet which
has been presenting a program of clas
sical music every week.
Forty Enrolled
At present there are 22 students en
rolled in music courses for credit, with
about the same number enrolled as
auditors.- This does not take into con
sideration those students that are in
choral work.
The orchestra, which has been under
the direction of Julius Haug since last
January, is making rapid advances and
plans to give a program in the Memo
rial Church later in the summer after
the Pro Arte Quartet series of musicals
has been completed.
Orchestra Grows
Under the leadership of Haug, the
class has been successful enough to
expand. Originally planned as a string
orchestra, the great interest shown in
the organization has brought about the
addition of many more instruments.
Allen is pleased with the amount of
interest shown in the music courses and
hopes it indicates the addition, in the
near future, of a regular music depart
ment at Stanford University.
