# STONE CONTRIBUTES PSYCHOLOGY PAPER
## 
### 
Professor Calvin Perry Stone, Stan
: ford University psychologist who re
j cently was invited by the University
j of Hamburg to contribute a scientific
; paper to a commemorative volume to
j be presented to Baron Jakob von Uex
i kuell, noted biologist, on his seventieth
birthday, has just completed and mailed
the paper, "A Comparative Study of
i Animal Motivation."
Professor von Uexkuell, a pioneer in
j the field of animal behavior, has exerted
; a worldwide influence on biology, med
| icine, and psychology, and has affected
j in large measure the philosophy of ed
ucation. His life-long study of the re
! action of fish to their environment es
pecially has furnished one of the start
ing points for the study of child psy
chology and the philosophy of educa
: tion.
i It was because of the Stanford pro
; fessor's work in the field of comparative
! psychology that he was invited to con
tribute to the volume. Professor Stone's
study will appear in a forthcoming
number of an American learned journal
I and probably in Bios, a German scien
i tific publication.
