# Pro Football League Is Planned for California
## 
### 
Pacific Coast football enthusiasts were
taking more seriously today the pro
posed organization of a professional
football league for California as plans
definitely took shape when it was
learned that Ted Shipkey is to manage
a Stanford team in Southern California
to compete against teams made up from
former Loyola, U.S.C., ILC.L.A., and
Occidental players, while "Brick" Mar
cus, former California star, will man
age a combined Stanford - California
team in the north of the state.
Brovelli, the "Dark Angel" from St.
Mary's, will lead a team supported by
such St. Mary's grads as the Canrinus
brothers; and the complete league will
consist of seven teams, four in the south
and three in the north. The third
northern outfit is the San Francisco-
Santa Clara team.
Northern games will be played on
Wednesday nights in the Seals Sta
dium, San Francisco, while the Gilmore
Stadium, Los Angeles, will house the
southern games on Sunday nights.
The winners in the north and south
will meet each week, and many men
are expected to be enlisted for the teams
soon. Jay Tod, former Stanford and
Olympic Club gridder, is one of the
many who have been approached but
have as yet taken no action to join the
professionals.
