# Roth Praises Rotary Aid To World Peace
## Many Different Countries Are Represented in Meet at Detroit Mexico City to Be Scene of Next Convention 
### 
Freshly returned from the interna
tional assembly and the annual inter
national convention of the Rotary Club,
Comptroller Almon E. Roth yesterday
stressed the great value of the group
as an international promoter of good
will.

The international executive assembly
at Makanak Island represented seventy
two countries. The thirty-six different
nationalities assembled their executives
at this conclave, and the good-will cre
ated will do much for international
peace, Roth said.
"These meetings are only a drop in
the bucket, but they will aid peace in
the future," he stated.
The annual international convention
in Detroit was of four days' duration.
The 7500 delegates met in general and
special sessions during the time, and
discussed the world's economic ills.
Detroit Hospitable
In Detroit the Rotarians were award
ed a royal reception, and the hospitality
was typical of that given to all Rotary
International conventions every year.
Automobile manufacturers gave some
300 of their cars to be used by the
delegates, and Detroit swarmed with
new cars bearing the Rotarians about
the city.
The general aims of the Rotary In
ternational, Roth said, are the building
up of community leadership; the em
phasis of ethics in business; and the
importance of international understand
ing.
Race Mixtures Striking
One-time Rotary International pres
ident, Roth enlarged on the mixture of
races at the assemblies. Representa
tives from India, Africa, Europe, New
Zealand, Japan, England, U.S., Can
ada, and South America attended. Roth
was most impressed by the delegates
from the Malay Settlements, referring
to them many times.
The Comptroller cited many inci
dents of foreigners learning to like and
respect America. A prominent Austra
lian journalist, for one, had come to
Detroit prejudiced against everything
American, but left with wholehearted
appreciation of American people, vir
tues, and ideas.
Next year the annual international
convention is to be at Mexico City.
The city's small housing facilities are
to be coped with by the building of a
Pullman city. Rows of Pullman cars
will be made into the best of living
surroundngs. Barber shops, dining
rooms, and everything that will go to
make up a complete village are to be
constructed.
