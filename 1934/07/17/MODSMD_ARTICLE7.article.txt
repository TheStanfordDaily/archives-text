# Davis Speaks On Radio Hour
## Discusses Farmers' Problems Under AAA 
### 
"Planned Agriculture Under the
AAA" was discussed by Dr. Joseph S.
Davis, director of the Stanford Food
Research Institute, as he spoke over
KPO, San Francisco, at 7:45 o'clock last
night. Chief economist for the Federal
Farm Board from 1929 to 1931 and now
collaborating with the Brookings In
stitute of Washington, D.C., on a cur
rent study of the AAA, Dr. Davis is
considered an authority on this subject.
Act Replaces Farm Board
According to Dr. Davis the main task
of the AAA lies in raising American ag
riculture from unprecedented depres
sion to a prosperity no longer meas
ured by that of industry. The Agricul
tural Adjustment Act is a substitute for
the Federal Farm Board, abandoned by
the new administration. In defense of
the junked Farm Board Davis said,
"This Act granted powers far exceed
ing those vested in the Federal Farm
Board; and the AAA, which has been
developed to administer these powers,
makes the old Farm Board look like a
piker."
Sign to Reducc Acreage
The farmers of basic products are
invited to sign contracts with the Secre
tary of Agriculture to reduce the acre
age of their crops. Dr. Davis stated that
the AAA buys the farmer off from
overproduction in order that prices will
be higher without additional t^xes.
He next considered an income in
surance feature of the benefit-payment
system. This year as last, farmers who
experienced crop failure and have prac
tically nothing to sell will get some in
come if they signed up on the benefit
payment contracts.
In considering the administration of
the AAA, the speaker stated, "A going
organization, hurriedly built up, not
yet shaken down, the Triple A seems
almost chaotic to one who visits it
briefly, and business men particularly
have complained bitterly of its dilatori
ness, theoretical ideas, and changes of
policy."
Dr. Davis finished his talk by giving
several arguments to support the state
ment that the Triple A has commonly
received more credit for the improve
ment to date than it has earned, and that
the Farm Board took the bull by the
horns and pointed agriculture in the
right direction.
