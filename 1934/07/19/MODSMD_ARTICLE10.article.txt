# Prof. McKenzie Speaks Tonight
## Sociologist to Discuss Recent Population Trends 
### 
Speaking this evening at eight o'clock
in the Dance Studio of the Women's
Gymnasium on "Some Modern Prob
lems in the Territorial Organization of
Society," Professor R. D. McKenzie will
discuss recent trends in the number,
distribution, and organization of popu
lation and communities as a background
for the understanding of some of our
present social problems and as a basis
for community planning.
"Today's population problems are be
coming more and more acute, and per
tain to a wider range of human interest.
Formerly these problems manifested
themselves mainly in ratios between
heads and food. Now the problem is
racial in movement and distribution;
economic in markets and jobs," accord
ing to Professor McKenzie.
First American Authority
Professor McKenzie is the foremost
American authority on human ecology,
and gave the first course on the sub
ject in the United States. At Stanford
this summer as the acting professor of
sociology, the Michigan savant McKen
zie has recently been approached by
bewildered California real estate agents
who want him to write a paper on the
contemporary population trends in this
state.
McKenzie is now studying the way
in which population problems manifest
themselves. The four great points in
his work are the trends in numbers,
distribution, interests, and planning of
the world's population.
Population Must Be Considered
Professor McKenzie insists that any
drastic- attempt to change the present
economic system must reckon with the
fact that it will involve fundamenal
changes in the distribution of popula
tion, and, therefore, produce further
disorganization of the settlement.
"The greatest task I have to face,"
said McKenzie, "is the forecasting of
the movement of population. That is
why modern efforts to segregate the
poor are such a great problem. There
is a great interest today in these efforts
to clean out slums."
