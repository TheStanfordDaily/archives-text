# Another Football?
## 
### 
One of the important bills scheduled for presentation at the next
session of the California Legislature is a measure calling for all state
employees, except those who are elected, to he given their jobs through
the media of civil service examinations instead of the present unsatis
factory "political plum" method.
Members of the California State Employees' Association have been
circulating petitions for some time, and the latest report shows 174,282
names on the list, where only 110.811 voters' signatures were needed.
Kvery section of the state is well represented on the petitions.
Now the problem comes up as to what will he done with the hill. Will
it become a political football and come out of the legislature kicked full
of holes? There is no question but that the passage of the proposal will
lessen the hold that politicians have on many of their supporters. These
backers, only naturally, expect something in return for their efforts.
J f a thorough job is done of pruning the state jobs tree, there will be so
few plums remaining that the candidates will have to resort to other
means of repaying their campaign assistants. It stands to reason that
these politicians should try to beat down this measure as much as pos
sibleâ€”or as much as they dare.
Retaining office staffs and heads under successive administrations
cannot help but have two healthy reactions. In the first place, a higher
plane of efficiency can be maintained and the new rulers of the com
monwealth's politics can institute their ideas more readily. Secondly, and
of greater interest to the general public, is the sound economics of the
problem. Maintenance of higher efficiency will reduce running costs,
it not having to be necessary to break in new office workers with the
new regime.
So far, there has been no open opposition to the bill. State employees,
the ones who will benefit directly by the bill, naturally are boosting for
all they are worth. Discounting their support and enthusiasm, voters
should be able to see the advantages of a civil service system in all state
departments. An appeal to state legislators now may help to save this
important bill from becoming another political football.
