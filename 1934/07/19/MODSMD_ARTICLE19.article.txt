# Au Revoir, Harvard

Stanford went a long way toward cementing her good will feeling
with one of the leading Kastern universities this week in her treatment
of the visiting Harvard baseball team. We were more than glad to return
the compliment for the wonderful spirit shown our football team when
they went East to play Dartmouth in 19.31.
Much credit must be given to our administrative and athletic officials
for the splendid manner in which they expressed the feeling of Stan
ford—especially Professor Mears.
We hope the Harvard people enjoyed our campus and their visit,
and will return again in the near future.
