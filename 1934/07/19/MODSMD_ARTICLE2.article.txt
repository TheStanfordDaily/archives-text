# Sea Adventures And Good Jobs Lure Students
## 
### 
The men from the Farm are
taking to the Sea! Neptune's lure
and the promise of good jobs are
drawing increasing numbers of
undergrads each week. Since most
of the jobs are thought to be for
the duration of the strike only, the
Quad next fall will probably look
like San Diego when the fleet
is in.
Although several of the men are
reported to be chipping paint in
San Francisco, a far cry from the
romance of the South Seas, some
are shipping out to the Orient on
tankers and freighters. The call
of the Southern Cross is too much
for the Sons of the Red and many
a football man will roll as he walks
next fall, and swap incredible
salty yarns, but many another will
remember only flakes of rust and
paint dropping into the Bay.
