# The 						Old Order Changeth
## 
### 
There is a building being erected on the campus which has been offi
cially named Lagunita Court. To the outsider, ibis beautiful new
women's dormitory is a manifestation of educational progress. To the
Stanford student it serves as a monument of a changing order.
Not so many years ago the dirty, corduroyed rough could spend his
free evenings in the lobby of Roble 1 fall without any fear of being in
the wrong place. To him Roble was synonymous with the "500" which
was so dear to his heart.
Now, the Stanford man—for the rough has almost entirely van
ished—will have to adjust himself to a new situation. The "500" is no
longer a reality; instead, the Stanfordite will have to be content to
divide his free evenings between time-honored Roble and "Lagunita
Court" where be will have an opportunity to meet the hciv Stanford
co cd.
