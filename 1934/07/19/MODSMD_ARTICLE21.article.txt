# DR. HEIL TELLS OF ITALIAN PAINTING
## 
### 
The Renaissance painting in Germany
differed as greatly from the Italian
painting as the hazy, atmospheric days
along the northern shores differ from
the clear brightness of the Mediterra
nean sky, according to Dr. Walter Heil,
director of the Palace of the Legion
of Honor and the M. H. de Young Me
morial Museum, in his illustrated lec
ture Tuesday night in the Assembly
Hall, where he spoke on "Principles of
Italian Renaissance Painting."
Dr. Heil showed, by a comparison
of painting methods, how the artists
reproduced the mood of their surround
ings and interpreted their subjects in
the light of their racial temperaments.
"The Germanic spirit gave an air of
sombernesss, of emotional intensity, to
painting that the Italians never felt," he
stated, pointing out on his lantern
slides the serene, reposeful beauty of
Giottto Â£tnd Botticelli and the plastic
strength of Michelangelo.
In summing up the lecture, he demon
strated the growth of painting knowl
edge and the use of perspective, and
that the evolutionary trend was from
simple sculptural figures through more
complex groupings of figures and space
toward architectural arrangement with
more plastic figures.
Dr. Heil is as famous in Europe as in
America. He was assistant curator of
the Bavarian state galleries in Germany,
and curator of the Research Institute
for the History of Art in Florence. Be
fore his position in San Francisco
was curator of European art in the
Institute of Arts at Detroit. Besides
being editor of the periodical "Art in
America and Elsewhere," he is corre
spondent for the magazine "Belvedere"
in Austria.
