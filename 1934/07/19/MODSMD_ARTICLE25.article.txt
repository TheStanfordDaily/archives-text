"Contrary to certain opinions, en
vironment in itself does not effectively
alter the human being, but must click
with the genetic processes at a time
when the personality is sensitive to that
particular influence," said Dr. Truman
L. Kelley, Harvard professor of Educa
tion, in his concluding lecture, "Psy
chology and Genetics," Tuesday after
noon.
Nature and nurture, he said, are both
important to psychological develop
ment, illustrating his point with the
cases of jungle children who had been
reared by wild animals. These children,
found at 12 years of age, were tillable
to learn anything but the rudiments of
language, although they would have
spoken normally if they had been in
contact with speech at the age of 2.
Children vary more at later ages be
cause the conditions of environment
differ more widely, said Dr. Kelley.
Dr. Kelley spoke Monday on "The
Psychological Foundations of Voca
tional Guidance."
"Tests graded on the basis of the
reader's judgment are highly falla
cious, in spite of their semblance of
accuracy," he declared.
He pointed out that in 1933 English
entrance examinations, Ihe chance fac
tor was the largest one operating, which
indicated low reliability for the test.
Altitude flights are usually made in
winter rather than in summer, because
there is less violent contrast between
temperatures at high altitudes and
those on the ground.
The world's oldest republic is An
dorra, a tiny territory with an area of
175 square miles and 6,000 population.
It is situated in the Pyrenees, between
France and Spain.
