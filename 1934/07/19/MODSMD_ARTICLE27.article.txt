# WORK RESUMES ON 'THE DOCTOR'S WIFE' WITH CHANGED CAST
## Roles of Deserting Players Are Capably Filled 
### 
With all major and minor roles filled,
rehearsals for the Stanford production
of Eric Linders' new play, '"The Doc
tor's Wife," hit a snag when Rosemary
! Sistrom, playing the part of "Lena," the
maid, was unavoidably forced to leave
the cast, and Paul Crary, who was to
take the part of "Dr. Wilson," got a job
on a China-bound boat.
The parts, however, have been ca
â€¢ pably filled. Kay Arthur, who played
! a lead in "Distant Drums" and will be
remembered as the maid in "Three
Cornered Moon," will replace Miss Sis
trom as "Lena." The part of young
| "Dr. Wilson" will be filled by Glenn
Reed, talented member of Mr. Helven
ston's acting classes.
Minor Roles Filled
The minor roles of the undertaker and
his assistant, unfilled for some time,
have been taken by Roger Komsthoeft
and Thomas Slattery respectively.
Komsthoeft, a medical student, has won
I awards in state Shakespearean contests.
A member of Mr. Hclvenston's class
in acting, Slattery is said to be a prom
! ising comedian.
Another role, long unfilled for lack
of obvious requirements, is being well
taken care of by a Boston bull terrier
from the kennel of Anne Bossinger. The
dog is said to be doing excellently as
: "Booze," the canine lead.
All Set for Friday Night
With all roles finally filled and re
hearsals ' under way, "The Doctor's
j Wife" is scheduled to be presented Fri
day night, August 3. In four acts it
will depict, in comedy form, the inside
