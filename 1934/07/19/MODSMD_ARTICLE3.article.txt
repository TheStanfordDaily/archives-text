# First Jolly-Up Huge Success
## 250 Roughs, Co-eds Come to Initial Social Event 
### Stull Powell 
The campus whipped itself out of its
lethargy last night under the guiding
hands of Marion Storey and Bob Gran
tier, members of the committee man
aging the jolly-up, and Joe College got
to know Betty Co-ed a little better
whilst whisking her around to the tunes
furnished by George Webster's Wood
side Country Club Band.
The Women's Clubhouse was filled to
overflowing with 250 people and the
dance floor was kept packed. Those of
the "roughs" who did pretty well at the
beginning began to edge into the gam
ing room for a little intensive work,
but this was soon broken by a good
sized stag line. Attendance was so good
that the gate-receipts warranted a half
hour's further dancing, with the conse
quence that the party did not officially
break up until 8:30 o'clock.
Branner Club announced during the
dance that they were planning to enter
tain in the* near future and severVl more
jolly-ups may be scheduled.
A preponderance of males was offset
by the work of the Women's Council in
rounding up all former campus women
in the vicinity and being sure they got
to the dance.
