# Lyman Wins Shot Put In Germany As American Team Is Walloped
## 
### CRAIG BARBASH 
Tuesday's word from Germany tells :
that the American track and field forces
took another walloping at the hands of
the German squad, four first places to
five. But Stanford's John Lyman kept
things from being worse by taking the !
.shotput at this, the second meet of the
German tour.
Polish and Hungarian athletes ganged i
up with the Germans on the Americans,
Meyer of Germany beating Lyman in
the discus by 7 inches with a throw of
147 feet 10 inches. Troy's sophomore,
Foy Draper, took the 200-meter dash
but American failures in the 800-meter i
and McClusky's loss to the Polish Olym
pic champion, Kusoczinski, in the two
mile, were the main American de- ,
feats. Lyman's throw in the shot was
52 feet 3 inches.
Eastman in Scandinavia
Ben Eastman has yet to show his
wares in Scandinavia; but San Fran
cisco sports writers, including Dink
Templeton, tout the Blazer as capable
of record-breaking performances in
any race from 400 to 1500 meters. Tem
pleton has not spoken with regard to
Eastman's chances at 1500 meters; but
he is emphatic in stating that no one
will recognize the 400-meter and 440-
yard records when Stanford's great run- !
ner is through with them.
Golfers Idle
Western Intercollegiate golfers looked
on with approval and pleasure recently
when U.C.L.A.'s Roy Ryden defeated '
Yale's ace, Burton Resnik, in the finals
of the Norwich Invitational Tourna
ment. Resnik was chief threat on the
Yale team which took second in the
team race in the Intercollegiate Cham
pionships at Cleveland.
Stanford golfers are no doubt cursing
the fates which kept the Indian club
swingers from entering these same
championships. A team composed of
*uch players as Lawson Little, "Spec"

Stewart, Don Edwards, Stuart Hawley,
Jack Hoerner, and Dan Moser or Tom
Dwyer could hardly have failed to
bring the team trophy back to the ;
Farm;* while one of them, Little in
particular, might have captured the
individual title.
Polo, Tennis Teams Out
It seems that Stanford has taken an
all-around beating from the fates and
finances, or both, which besides hitting
the golf team have kept polo and tennis
varsities out of summer competition. j
The polo squad was particularly wor
thy, and probably would have made an
impression in the national collegiates
where Princeton, Yale, Penn Military,
Missouri, Army, and a couple of others
were the only entries. The winner,
Army, beat Troy by about the same
margin Stanford did; so it is a shame
mallet swingers Rasmussen, Fullerton,
Rogers, and Luppen couldn't compete;
but maybe the B.A.C. will come through
with a trip for them next year.
Otis Wins
The Stanford tennis forces, left to
competing individually, are, neverthe
less, cutting quite a swath in the sum
mer championships. Besides winning
the Colorado State singles champion
ship, captain Chuck Otis teamed with
Willa Wolcot to beat Robert Stanford
and Mrs. Clariba Teel for the mixed
doubles title, (5-4, 6-3.
In the meantime Bill Seward, fresh
man player, was advancing to the finals
in the Washington State doubles cham
pionship, by pairing with Oswald to
whip Charles Hunt, San Francisco, and
Sam Lee, Stanford man.
Mcdica Has Unique Form
Watching Jack Medica in swimming
practice Monday gave many an idea of
perpetual motion, and more particularly
his peculiar paddling style, as the Uni
versity of Washington champion swam
(he length of the large Encina pool
time after time. His rolling style, by
which he raises his head at both sides,
and places his hands in the water palm
facing outward, was surprising to watch
but undoubtedly effective, if we look at
the Seattle boy's world records. Medica
gets body balance in the water by
turning his head up to both right and
left. He breathes in from the right side
only, and hardly raises his head out of
the water on the left.
Word that Stanford baseball mentor,
Harry Wolter, will join a team of old
timers to oppose the Palo Alto Black
Sox on Sunday brings America's origi
nal "national pastime" into notice. The
game will be played at the Palo Alto
Community diamond and should give
the baseball fans quite a treat. Coach
Wolter is an ex-major leaguer, so ob
servers can expect to see some genuine
pitching when he takes the mound
Sunday.
Contrary to general belief, fish sleep.
They can often be seen sleeping at the
bottom of fish bowls in a lifeless posi
tionâ€”occasionally they are even found
sleeping on their sides.
The only anonymous donor to the
University last month as revealed in the
minutes of the meeting of the Board of
Trustees last week was someone who
gave $35 to the Library Salary Account.
