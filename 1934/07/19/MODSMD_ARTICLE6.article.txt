A native of Chicago, and a student at
its two universities, Bacon began his
career as a concert pianist with tours
in Germany and in the Middle West.
Later he joined the faculty of the East

the same time assistant conductor of the
Rochester American Opera Company
(later the American Opera Company of
New York).
Wrote Prize Symphony
Bacon's compositions include five
works for symphony orchestra, of which
the Symphony in D Minor won the Pu
litzer prize for 1932, and about 140 songs
and numerous works for two pianos
and piano solos. His songs have been
sung by Roland Hayes, Sigrid Onegin,
Povla Frijsch, George Houston, Ethel
Leuning, Eva Gautier, and Emily Hardy.
Bacon's symphonic works have been
played by the Rochester Philharmonic
Orchestra and the San Francisco Sym
phony. Since the beginning of his resi
dence in San Francisco, where since
1928 he has been active largely as a
teacher, he has been connected with the
San Francisco Conservatory of Music,
and for the last four months has been
music editor of The Argonaut.
Varied Program
Bacon's program will include Fan
tasy in C Minor by Mozart; Sonata in
F Minor by Brahms; "The Pampas"
(from the Roumanian) and "Beat,
Drums" (after Whiteman) by Josiah
Smith, a young American composer
now living in San Francisco; Hungarian
Rhapsody No. 13 by Liszt, and "Cha
conne" for violin (arranged by Busoni)
by Bach.
Late-comers will be held until the
completion of the first number.
