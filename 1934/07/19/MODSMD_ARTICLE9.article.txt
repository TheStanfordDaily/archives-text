# Building Activity Not Affected By General Strike
## 
### 
Except for a temporary walkout
Tuesday of tile setters at Lagunita
Court who believed that they were
forced to strike because of affilia
tion with a San Francisco local,
the campus continued to be un
affected by the paralyzed com
mercial conditions to date.
George Wagner, general contrac
tor for the new women's dormitory,
said that the tile setters soon re
sumed their work when it was
explained to them that they were
not forced to quit, because they
were working outside of the strike
area.
Rumors that plasterers had laid
off were denied by Wagner, who
said that the completion of work
had necessitated the dismissal of
all but a few plasterers who were
being retained to do some small
jobs about the buildings.
