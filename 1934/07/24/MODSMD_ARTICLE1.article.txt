# Stanford Lets P.A. Lead Way In Beer Issue
## University Not To Attempt Any Legal Action On Land Clause Courts' Rulings Differ On Effects of 3.2 
### 
What few Palo Altans knew before
this week-end —that 3.2 beer sei'ved
with meals has been legal in the city
since the repeal of the eighteenth
amendment—caused a mild sensation
Friday as beer selling began at Thur
low's.
Stanforfd Comptroller Almon E.
Roth said that the University will fol
low the action of the City of Palo Alto
in regard to the matter. This action as
revealed by City Attorney Arnold Rum
well will be to allow the sale of beer to
continue as it is perfectly legal.
The Palo Alto cigar and coffee shop
that is selling the beer has shown a
marked increase in patronage, and the j
sale of beer is "going pretty well," Ted
Thurlow avers. One has only to drop
in during meal time to see the number
of additional patrons eating at the cof
fee shop. Approximately half of the
patrons take beer with their meals.
City Voted Dry
A petition circulated at the initiative
of Thurlow before the repeal of the
prohibition amendment to allow the
sale 0f'3.2 beer in Palo Alto was voted
down last autumn, but since repeal the
sale of the beverage has been legal.
The clause in the property deeds of
Palo Alto states that the "manufacture
or sale of intoxicating liquor" on the
property deeded will automatically re
vert the property to the University.
Through these clauses in the deeds of
property bought from Timothy Hop
kins, Stanford trustee and adopted son
of famed Mark Hopkins, Stanford has
become a legal party in matters in
volving the sale of liquor in Palo Alto.
3.2 Intoxicating?
A square decision saying whether
3.2 beer is intoxicating has not been
in the state of California. Some
decisions of federal courts have ruled
both ways —yes and no.
The much-discussed provision in the
California criminal code that rules it
unlawful to sell intoxicating liquors
within a mile and a half of a University
campus will be enforced in Palo Alto,
Attorney Rumwell said. But "amend
ments to the mile-and-a-half protective
law for universities excepted the sale
of 3.2 beer within those limits," the city
attorney revealed.
Despite published reports that Stan
ford may act to stop the sale of beer,
in following the policy of the city
which is one of toleration, it is quite
unlikely that the University will risk
its reversionary rights by bringing the
matter to court, The Daily learned.

in during meal time to see the number
of additional patrons eating at the cof
fee shop. Approximately half of the
patrons take beer with their meals.
City Voted Dry
A petition circulated at the initiative
of Thurlow before the repeal of the
prohibition amendment to allow the
sale 0f'3.2 beer in Palo Alto was voted
down last autumn, but since repeal the
sale of the beverage has been legal.
The clause in the property deeds of
Palo Alto states that the "manufacture
or sale of intoxicating liquor" on the
property deeded will automatically re
vert the property to the University.
Through these clauses in the deeds of
property bought from Timothy Hop
kins, Stanford trustee and adopted son
of famed Mark Hopkins, Stanford has
become a legal party in matters in
volving the sale of liquor in Palo Alto.
3.2 Intoxicating?
A square decision saying whether
3.2 beer is intoxicating has not been
in the state of California. Some
decisions of federal courts have ruled
both ways —yes and no.
The much-discussed provision in the
California criminal code that rules it
unlawful to sell intoxicating liquors
within a mile and a half of a University
campus will be enforced in Palo Alto,
Attorney Rumwell said. But "amend
ments to the mile-and-a-half protective
law for universities excepted the sale
of 3.2 beer within those limits," the city
attorney revealed.
Despite published reports that Stan
ford may act to stop the sale of beer,
in following the policy of the city
which is one of toleration, it is quite
unlikely that the University will risk
its reversionary rights by bringing the
matter to court, The Daily learned.
