"Drama and Theatre in the Modern
University" was discussed by Harold
Helvenston, director of dramatics, in
his talk given during the Stanford Hour
over KPO at 7:45 o'clock last night.
Helvenston stated that in looking
back over the history of the earliest
universities no mention is made of
drama and theatre as curricular sub
jects. "This," he said, "was probably
due to the very character and spirit of
the American pioneer. Drama, to the
early settlers, was an actual drama of
grim reality and sturdy efforts to earn
and maintain their rights; dramatic
plots were based upon their human
successes and failures. The theatre,
however meagre, was placed on the
level of the saloon and considered a
veritable temple of scandal and seduc
tionâ€”a place infested with vice and
sin."
Today times have changed, he said,
and the theatre and drama have been
relegated to a sphere in their own
right. There are a number of univer
sities in which dramatic subjects arc
included within the department of Eng
lish or Fine Arts, and the drama is al
lowed to participate to a far greater
degree in the academic responsibility of
the university, Helvenston said.
"In a number of universities the
drama has become of such importance
to student life," he continued, "that
progressive executives have seen fit to
provide complete training plants
equipped with model theatres, class
rooms, and technical laboratories.
Helvenston went on to state the prob
lem of analyzing cne particular student
to sec whether that student has talent
and the essential interest in drama. The
student gets relaxation and self-expres
sion; he enlarges his social scope within
the university community; he learns of
human relationships, customs, and man
ners. According to Helvenston, these
are but a few of the individual benefits
of dramatic work.
Helvenston remarked in concluding
that "the whole subject of drama and
theatre in the modern university may
be summed up in the words of Profes
sor Drummond of Cornell, who said,
'No one has devised a better instrument
for functional education than a college
theatre of high standards, well directed
and disciplined.'"
