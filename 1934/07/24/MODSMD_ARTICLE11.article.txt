# Davis Doubts Famine Peril

### 
When the worlds population reaches
four billion—if it ever does —it will
probably be fed just as well as the pres
ent population, and perhaps better, de
clared Dr. Joseph S. Davis, a director
of Stanford's Food Research Institute,
in a radio broadcast for the San Fran
cisco Community Forum Sunday after
i noon. Dr. Carl L. Alsberg, also a di
j rector of the Institute, joined with Dr.
Davis in discussing the topic, "Food for
Four Billion."
Danger of famine, the speakers
pointed out, is faced only by those coun
-1 tries that lack adequate transportation
! facilities, like Russia, or by countries
in which the people are too poor to buy
imported food, as in China. Where ade
[ quate transportation facilities are avail
able there is little danger of famine in
I any region, they said.
It is a mistake to think that the earth
feeds mankind, said Dr. Davis. Man
kind, he declared, feeds itself by its in
telligence and efforts and with the aid
of land; if only land were necessary to
produce food, the aborigines would have
i been better fed than they were before
Columbus discovered America.
Dr. Alsberg, while praising our fed
! eral food laws as probably the best in
' the world, pointed out their present de
fects. The federal laws, he explained,
1 apply only to foods that cross a state
| line, thus requiring, under our consti
-1 tutional system, more effective state and
! local laws.
"I have known of a manufacturer,'
he said, "who produced two lines of
groceries, one good enough to comply
with the federal law for sale to custo
mers outside his state, and another line
for sale within his state."
The California law, Dr. Alsberg said,
i is very similar to the federal law.
A second defect of the present fed
eral laws is that, while requiring truth
j ful statements on the label, they do not
require a manufacturer to tell the truth
about his goods in advertising. Dr.
Alsberg expressed the hope that this
defect would be remedied as far as is
i possible by the next Congress.
