# Radio Debate Depicts Basic Cause of War
## Profit Motive Main Factor, Affirms Ed. Lindblom For Stanford College of Pacific Takes Negative Stand 
### 
"Resolved: That the Profit Motive is
the Basic Cause of War," was the ques
tion Â£or the debate between Stanford
University and the College of the Pa
cific, over KYA yesterday aftei'noon at
2 o'clock. Edward Lindblom upheld the
affirmative side for Stanford against
Ernest Poletti of the College of the
Pacific. George A. Conolly, prominent
attorney and member of the San Fran
cisco Bar Association, which sponsors
this "Intercollegiate Forum," presided.
Lindblom argued that wars are
caused by small groups of individuals
who build up the patriotism of the
people and then direct that patriotism
into war frenzy for the purpose of
making profits out of war.
"War and arbitration are the two
means of settling disputes; they are not
the disputes themselves. What factor
guides a nation to the path of war in
stead of the path of arbitration? The
profit motive!"
Poletti, in stating the negative of the
question, admitted that the profit mo
tive was a cause of war, but denied that
it was the "basic" cause, giving in its
place, "man's desire for power."
"I contend that the profit motive is
| not the primary, the elementary, the
I basic cause of war. Dominant groups
j desire war for four reasons: To get into
' control at home, to avoid losing control
at home, to turn attention from unsat
i isfactory conditions at home caused by
| the control of that dominating group,
' and the profit motive."
No decision was given by the Bar
! Association as to the winner of the de
' bate. Conolly stated: "That is left to the
discretion of the listeners."
