# "THE DRUNKARD" TO GIVE CAMPUS CHANCE TO BOO
## 
### 
The Stanford rough will have un
paralleled opportunity to "bird" the
actors when "The Drunkard" comes to
the Fox Stanford Theatre next Friday.
P. T. Barnum's dramatic success of a
century ago has been revived in New
York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco
with great success.
"Applause is in order at any time
during this dramatic masterpiece," says
a statement issued by the management.
They "respectfully urge the audience
to give way to their natural impulses
upon the fall of each curtain," inviting
the patrons to "cheer with the hero,
weep with the beautiful and pure hero
ine, and hiss the villain."
