The term social lag is coming more and more into prominence—as
commonly accepted, it refers to the inability of certain social institutions
to keep tip with changing conditions. With all due respect to those who
are now working for advanced degrees, the field of education exemplifies
an extreme degree of social lag.
There have been a thousand and one definitions and ''aims" of educa
tion. All of them worth mentioning include the idea of training the
member or would be member to fit into the existing society. Very few
people will question the value of education or the desirability of attaining
its aim, but the methods that arc being used are constantly open to
criticism.
Look at the modern college or university in the light that it is trying to
prepare us as students to enter adult life with the least possible friction.
Many of us will go into business where economic competition will force
us to lay stress on present conditions with an ever increasing tendency
to be ready to make decisions for future welfare.
What has been our training in college? Most of it has been in terms
of the past. Many educators will not consider contemporary problems
because "not enough time has elapsed to get the proper perspective."
I'ntil the particular problem has "aged" sufficiently, the student must
either grope or be content to wait. By. the time discussion is ripe, mem
bers of the outside world have contemptuously labelled it "ancient history."
It is by no means the purpose of this discussion to belittle the type of
study which stresses "underlying trends and past experience," rather, it
is to suggest to future educators who are now getting their degrees, the
advisability of administering at least small doses of practical, contem
porary problems and their immediate effects. The writer hazards the
prediction that the increased interest of the student will more than com
pensate for the lack of perspective. —IT. A. W.
