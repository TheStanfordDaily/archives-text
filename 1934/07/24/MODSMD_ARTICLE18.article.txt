# Where Are You Going, Mr. World?

Today's naval armament race between the powers of the world makes
the competition of 1 ( X)0 to 1914 look quite aenemic. The famed 5-5-3
ratio decreed and agreed to at the 1922 Washington Conference (the
one good thing done by a shameful and morbid administration) will ex
pire very soon. The London Treaty has in a way superseded the Wash
ington pact, but England, this month, has declared that 'M'ritain must
free herself from the stranglehold of the Loudon Xaval Treaty" in the
words of the doughty sea-dog, Admiral Karl Beatty.
As matters stand now. England will have built to full treaty limit by
1936; and Japan will have exceeded her quota under the 5-5-3 ratio.
President Roosevelt's altruistic interest in naval ship-building will have
ihc I'nited States up to treaty par by 1939. France and Italy, who neither
agreed to the London Naval Treaty, are staging an armament race be
tween themselves. Ostensibly in answer to (iermany's 10.000-ton pocket
battleships, France laid down the 26.500-ton battleship Dunkerqile and
a sister ship to follow. This spring Ifaly countered with orders for two
35,000-ton battleships.
There seems to be nothing that can stop a world armament race;
therefore, nothing appears to be able to stop a more disastrous war than
the world has ever dreamt of seeing.
Why is nationalism so rampant in a time when the world is just be
ginning to realize how interdependent is each nation upon the others eco
nomically ?
A plug in the proverbial dike holding back war would be the joining
of the League of Nations openly by the United States. If a war comes,
the I'nited States cannot stay out of it. Why not join the League and
be in a position to more ably check an impending war? Omitting all
altruism and considering only selfish motives and reasons, the I'nited
States should and must joint the League to aid world peace.
If the I'nited States does not join your League, Mr. World, where
are you going for peace? - ' What will happen if a great war docs break out?
