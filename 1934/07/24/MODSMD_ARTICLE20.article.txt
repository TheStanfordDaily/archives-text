# CAMPUS OPINION
## WHAT IS "CHAOS"? 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Interesting and perhaps reassuring is
the analysis of the Nazi "purging" as
recounted by one of Stanford's most
enthusiastic apologists for the Hitler
regime, Dr. Camillo von Klenze, in
Tuesday's Daily.
It is the opinion of Dr. von Klenze
i that Hitler in the chancellery is the only
f thing which saves Germany, and the
whole of Europe, from "chaos." Yet
those who have followed events in Ger
many via newspaper, and especially by
.way of Hitler's own words on the radio
and in his "Mein Kampf," may well
ponder the meaning of "chaos."
Webster casts some light on the
meaning of the term. CHAOS: "A state
of things in which chance is supreme."
The spirits of those hundreds tortured
to death by Hitler's brown-shirted co
horts could well testify to the security
of life in the Fatherland. . . .
Webster continues. CHAOS: "Nature
conceived as subject to no law." If
Hitler believes he has acted according
to any sort of civilized "law," then in
deed perversion has invaded the Ger
man language as well as the ranks of
the Storm Troops.
And as to Dr. von Klenze's little jest
that Hitler has established a state, "the
aims of which are entirely pacific," one
need only peruse the new German
bible, "Mein Kampf." That scholarly
contribution to the culture of the ages
re-echoes with the song: Women shall
hear babies; men shall bear arms. True,
Hitler has not tried to reverse the proc
ess, but that is small satisfaction. Any
one who sincerely hopes that Europe
and the world can be saved from the
catastrophic chaos of another world
war can find little comfort in a regime
that enshrines Mars, and sows the ha
tred and bitterness which must inevi
tably lead to armed conflict.
I had almost forgotten. Webster's last
remark in re CHAOS is most certainly
a sly dig at the German chancellor.
CHAOS: "a yawning chasm, gulf, or
abyss."
