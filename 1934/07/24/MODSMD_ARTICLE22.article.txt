# GRANTIER CHOSEN AS FARM SPEAKER IN RADIO DEBATE
## Broadcast Scheduled For Monday Is Second Of Summer Air Series 
### 
Chosen to represent Stanford in the
second radio debate of the summer
quarter, Bob Grantier, member of the
Men's Council and veteran debater, will
uphold the negative on the proposition
"Resolved: That California should adopt
a system of socialized medicine." His
opponent in the debate, which is sched
uled for 2 o'clock next Monday over
KYA, will be a representative of the
University of San Francisco.
The debaters will argue as to whether
or not the state should provide facilities
for the great number of middle-class
people who cannot afford adequate med
ical aid, a question being discussed not
only by the medical fraternity but by
other people interested in .social trends.
It is held that the wealthy can afford
good medical care and that the poor
can receive care at county hospitals, but
tha-t the average man cannot afford all
the care he and his family should have,
nor can he permit himself to accept the
aid given the indigent.
Grantier, a seasoned speaker, has de
bated with representatives of Frenso
State, College of Puget Sound, U.S.C.,
San Jose State, U.C., University of
British Columbia, Pacific University,
Linfield College, Willamette, Albany
College, Oregon State, and the Uni
versity of Montana.
