# Integration of Art With Life Is New Study Plan
## 
### 
The study of art in its interrelation
ship with all phases of living is the
procedure proposed for the summer
quarter. In this plan emphasis is placed
upon the significance of art in the his
tory of civilization, and its relation to
the growth of letters, social sciences and
history. In place of a course of study in
art expression alone, various depart
ments are planning to present ideas
tending to the development of art
appreciation as an integral part of life.
With Professor Kurt F. Reinharat,
of the Department of Germanic Lan
guages as chairman, a committee of
three including Professor Hazel Han
sen, of the classical literature depait
ment, and Dr. Henry Lanz, of Slavic
languages, has proposed the unusual
summer program. This program was
proposed to supplement instruction by
Professor Edward Farmer of the de
partment of graphic arts with other
courses of applied art interpretation.
Professor Farmer states that plans
are being made for a more advanced
program which will be adapted for the
next academic year.
