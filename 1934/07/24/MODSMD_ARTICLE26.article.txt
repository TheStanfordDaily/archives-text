### 
That the distribution and character
of population are factors given too lit
tle consideration in social problems was
a contention of Professor Roderick D.
McKenzie before a large audience
Thursday night in the dance studio of
the Women's Gymnasium.
Professor McKenzie, who is a visiting
savant from the University of Michigan,
spoke as the foremost American au
thority on human ecology when he said
that "the ftiur great points of this work
are analysis of the trends in numbers,
distribution, interest, and planning of
the world's population.
He explained that the type of popu
lation in the United States was in
fluenced by peoples' economic pursuits
and their racial characteristics. And he
was emphatic in stating that "to
change our present economic system we
must reckon with the fact that it would
involve fundamental changes in the
distribution of population."
