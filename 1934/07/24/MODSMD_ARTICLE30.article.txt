# LYMAN VICTORIOUS; OTIS BEATS RIVAL; LITTLE DEFEATED
## 
### 
Trackman John Lyman, tennis player,
Charles Otis, and golfer Lawson Little
were the sons of Stanford who shared
the major honors of focusing the sport
spotlight on their University during the
week-end.
Particularly noteworthy was Lyman's
double triumph in the weights which
brought to the American athletes their
first victory in German competition.
Marks of 50 feet 4% inches in the shot
and 163 feet 10% inches in the discus,
the latter a tremendous improvement
for Lyman, were what brought him and
his team victory.
Meanwhile Otis, varsity net captain
last year, was continuing to march
through stern opposition to capture his
second tennLs crown in as many weeks
—the La Jolla tournament, with a 6-3,
6-3, 2-6, 6-4 win over Lieutenant Dolf
Muelheisen of San Digeo.
Lawson Little furthered his claim to
the title "philanthropist golfer" Sun
day when, paired with his former tutor,
Larry Brazil, he bcwed in defeat to
Charles Ferrera and Ernie Pieper, play
ing before a gallery of 1,000 fans he had
attracted, at 50 cents a head, to help
send the San Francisco Public Links
team to Pittsburgh for the National
Public Links Championships next week.
The foursome match, a best-ball affair,
found the Little-Brazil team 1 down at
the conclusion, but not until Little's
sub-par 69 had been bested by Fer
rera's 68.
A similar match last week, featuring
Stanford's British amateur champion,
helped finance the San Jose links squad
to the same championships.
