## 
### 
Rehearsals of Eric Lenders' play,
"The Doctor's Wife," are proceeding
regularly after a second change in the
cast, made necessary by Kay Arthur's
inability to be present on the night of
the play. Miss Arthur, who. replaced
Rosemary Sistrom as "Lena" the maid,
has in turn been replaced by Marjorie
Meyer, who will be remembered for
her lead in "The Goose Hangs High."
Medical paraphanalia necessary for
the setting of the third act has been
volunteered by several ambulance or
ganizations, and the play is rounding
into shape for the presentation Au
j gust 3.
Depicting as it does the inside life of
' a doctor's household, the play promises
I to x'eveal many unknown happenings in
| the private life of a physician.
