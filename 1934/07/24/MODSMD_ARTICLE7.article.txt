"Stimulated Recovery, Fundamental
Reform, and the Business Situation and
Prospect" will be the subject of a talk
by Professor W. L. Crum, acting pro
fessor of economics, Thursday evening
at 8 o'clock in the dance studio of the
Women's Gymnasium.
Professor Crum will discuss the re
lation of the official economic program
to the immediate and long-run outlook
for business. Starting with the assertion
that three main factors are present in
the situation—the natural tendency to
ward revival, the stimulants applied to
induce recovery, and the official pur
pose to effectuate certain long-run re
forms—he will discuss the conflicts
among these factors and the probable
effects of such conflicts upon the course
of business. Looking farther ahead, he
will hazard an opinion as to the scope
of the changes likeiy to be wrought in
our economy.
