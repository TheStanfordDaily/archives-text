# Chicago University Savant Tells of New Code Pleading
## 
### John S. Mitchell 
Only a few states in conservative New J
England and in the South now retain j
the old common law system of pleading I
in civil actions, it was pointed out to- !
day in an interview by visiting Pro- |
fessor E. W. Hinton of the School of J
Law.
Professor Hinton, who teaches code j
pleading and evidence in the University
of Chicago Law School and is a former
judge of the Illinois Circuit Court, is a
member of the Illinois Bar Association
Committee which was instrumental in
securing the adoption last year of a
modern code system of pleading over
the long drawn out opposition of con
servative and rural Illinois lawyers.
All of the papers filed in a suit pre
liminary to the actual trial are called
pleadings. At one time pleadings were
lengthy, and constituted a sort of game
in which the most clever lawyer won
out by technicalities. It often was an
agonizing process to get to a point
where the issues were joined and the
trial itself could be started. Dickens, in
his novel, "Bleak House," relates a story
of the famous suit of Jarndyce v. Jarn
dyce in which the pleadings continued
for about fifty years before the trial
could be started. Cases similar to this
were not uncommon under the old sys
tem of common law pleadings.
1 Code pleading eliminates much of this
old form. It is an attempt to simplify
the pi'eliminaries as they existed under
the old system. In most states today,'
the judicial code limits the number of
pleadings to two, and new facts in the
| pleadings are amended into the orig
; inals. The code in these states allows
j for the joining of the various forms of
I action and of suits in equity with actions
at law.
| New York was the first state to adopt
j code pleading in 1849. In 1850 California
| copied the New York code. Since that
i time all of the states west of the Mis-
I sissippi River have adopted codes based
! on the New York code of pleading.
Illinois kept the conservative old form
i until a year ago when a code was

drafted, based partly on the New York
code and partly on the English rules,
according to Professor Hinton.
The Chicago law professor pointed
out that it is probable that all the states
will soon have a code system of plead-

ing. Mississippi, New Hampshire, Ver
mont, Rhode Island, and Georgia are
conservative states which still retain the
common law system of pleading.
The principal obstacle to adoption of
the improved system comes from the
lawyers who do not want to learn a new
form of pleading. These lawyers have a
great influence in the legislatures, and
in many states prevented the new codes
from being adopted for a long time.
The disadvantage of the code system is
that neither the lawyers nor the courts
are familiar with the codes at the pres
ent time, but Professor Hinton believes
that when they understand the new sys
tem more thoroughly it will speed up
trials and prove to be a great advance
ment and aid to our judicial system.
