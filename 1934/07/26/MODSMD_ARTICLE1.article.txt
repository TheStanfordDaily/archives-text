# Stanford Eleven Ready for Fall Football Season
## Prospects More Promising Than Last Year's Great Team Many Returning Lettermen Bolster Squad 
### 
Prospects far more promising than,
those which carried the 1933 varsity into !
the championship fight were the out
look for this year's gridiron squad,!
which is slated to return to the campus!
around September 10 to begin practice!
for fall football battles.
According to the estimate of Don J
Liebendorfer, Stanford News Bureau:
director, and other experts, the Indian !
varsity, which remains almost intact j
after its race to a tie for the Pacific-
Coast Conference title last year, is in a
very definite position to defend its
crown, despite a gruelling schedule.
Only the two guard positions leave
serious gaps in the Stanford team, all-
American Bill Corbus, and dependable
Bob O'Connor vacating their last year's
positions through graduation; while the
only other question as to the first string
Stanford line-up is who is to fill in op
posite Monk Moscrip as the other reg
ular end.
Much Material
Meanwhile reinforcements from the
ranks of transfers, former freshmen,
grays, and returning lettermen who are
not regulars, insure plenty of backing
up for the prospective first string, with
many positions in such dispute that re
placements in the ultimate starting
line-up are bound to be made before
the team takes the field for its first
game, September 22, against San Jose
State.
Rouble and Adams, last year's sensa
tional pair of guards who were kept out
of regular competition only by the
sterling play of Corbus and O'Connor,
seem to have the edge for the regular
positions this year; but they will be
closely pressed by Bob Black, Rusty
Maino, Tony Aguilar, Louis Tsoutsou
vas, and Jack Walton. The end play of
Keith Topping gives him the edge to
break in now as a regular end; but he
may be replaced by the more steady
but less brilliant Lyi? Smith.
Well-balanced Backficld
The well-balanced backfield, which
crumpled the walls of Troy, seems cer
tain to remain intact —Alustiza at quar
ter, Van Dellen and Hamilton at halfs,
and Grayson at full—despite stern op
position from Maentz, Anderson, and
Hoos for the halfback, fullback, and
quarterback jobs, respectively.
Those who saw Ben Palamountain
trample over rugby opponents last
spring were certain he would develop
greatly as a footballer; yet this 200-
pounder stands no better than an even
chance of beating off juniors Bob Man
gan and Alex Ttompas, and a new
comer, Bob Steiner, for first reserve end
positions.
Regulars in Line
Regulars from last season, Bob Rey
nolds and Claude Calloway, both jun
iors, appear well entrenched in the
regular tackle posts; but Wes Muller,
regular center, appears to stand no bet
ter than even with Alf Brandin who
was out of competition because of in
jury last year.
Sweet backfield prospects who don't
appear to be up to the regulars, but
stand chances of playing consistently
are John Reisner, Shelly Bronstein, Ray
Todd, Chuck White, and Ray Lewis.
Also, Chuck Ledbeiter, Fred Williams,
and Joe Vigna, former frosh, should
give great depth to the backfield sup
port.
Overflowing milk-and-honey pros
pects will have to reach their complete
fulfillment, and every ounce of talent
will have to be developed by the capa
ble "Tiny" Thornhill and his staff in
order to meet the ambitious program
that has been marked out for the 1934
varsity—a schedule which includes such
teams as Northwestern, Oregon State,
U.S.C., Washington, and California.

nolds and Claude Calloway, both jun
iors, appear well entrenched in the
regular tackle posts; but Wes Muller,
regular center, appears to stand no bet
ter than even with Alf Brandin who
was out of competition because of in
jury last year.
Sweet backfield prospects who don't
appear to be up to the regulars, but
stand chances of playing consistently
are John Reisner, Shelly Bronstein, Ray
Todd, Chuck White, and Ray Lewis.
Also, Chuck Ledbeiter, Fred Williams,
and Joe Vigna, former frosh, should
give great depth to the backfield sup
port.
Overflowing milk-and-honey pros
pects will have to reach their complete
fulfillment, and every ounce of talent
will have to be developed by the capa
ble "Tiny" Thornhill and his staff in
order to meet the ambitious program
that has been marked out for the 1934
varsity—a schedule which includes such
teams as Northwestern, Oregon State,
U.S.C., Washington, and California.
Prospects far more promising than,
those which carried the 1933 varsity into !
the championship fight were the out
look for this year's gridiron squad,!
which is slated to return to the campus!
around September 10 to begin practice!
for fall football battles.
According to the estimate of Don J
Liebendorfer, Stanford News Bureau:
director, and other experts, the Indian !
varsity, which remains almost intact j
after its race to a tie for the Pacific-
Coast Conference title last year, is in a
very definite position to defend its
crown, despite a gruelling schedule.
Only the two guard positions leave
serious gaps in the Stanford team, all-
American Bill Corbus, and dependable
Bob O'Connor vacating their last year's
positions through graduation; while the
only other question as to the first string
Stanford line-up is who is to fill in op
posite Monk Moscrip as the other reg
ular end.
Much Material
Meanwhile reinforcements from the
ranks of transfers, former freshmen,
grays, and returning lettermen who are
not regulars, insure plenty of backing
up for the prospective first string, with
many positions in such dispute that re
placements in the ultimate starting
line-up are bound to be made before
the team takes the field for its first
game, September 22, against San Jose
State.
Rouble and Adams, last year's sensa
tional pair of guards who were kept out
of regular competition only by the
sterling play of Corbus and O'Connor,
seem to have the edge for the regular
positions this year; but they will be
closely pressed by Bob Black, Rusty
Maino, Tony Aguilar, Louis Tsoutsou
vas, and Jack Walton. The end play of
Keith Topping gives him the edge to
break in now as a regular end; but he
may be replaced by the more steady
but less brilliant Lyi? Smith.
Well-balanced Backficld
The well-balanced backfield, which
crumpled the walls of Troy, seems cer
tain to remain intact —Alustiza at quar
ter, Van Dellen and Hamilton at halfs,
and Grayson at full—despite stern op
position from Maentz, Anderson, and
Hoos for the halfback, fullback, and
quarterback jobs, respectively.
Those who saw Ben Palamountain
trample over rugby opponents last
spring were certain he would develop
greatly as a footballer; yet this 200-
pounder stands no better than an even
chance of beating off juniors Bob Man
gan and Alex Ttompas, and a new
comer, Bob Steiner, for first reserve end
positions.
Regulars in Line
