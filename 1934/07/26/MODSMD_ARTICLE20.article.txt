# Greeks Dress Up
## 
### 
Wo arc seeing plenty of signs this summer of what has been here
tofore one of tlie more obscure elements of Stanford's "new deal." Pan
llellenism is truly entrenched on the Farm.
Started by the long-heralded reconstruction of the Phi Delt house
last year, the inception of which move fell on the cars of rushces who
have long since graduated, fraternity and sorority houses all along the
row and on the hills arc now showing outward signs -of "dress-up"
movements.
The death of administrative opposition to Stanford Greeks, necessi
tated by the depression's effective blasting of the possibility of a dormi
tory plan for all students, and last quarter's female ballot for the
retention of sororities placed on the shoulders of Hanta's all the respon
sibility of continuing to provide for a definite proportion of Stanford's
new swelled enrollment.
More students arc coming to the campus and more want to affiliate
themselves with the now twenty-four fraternities and nine sororities. The
Alpha Phis are rivaling the University's Lagunita Court in their effort
to accommodate the more than a scorc who rang their doorbell last win
ter. the Thetas, Kappas, and others are doing likewise, and the men's
groups are improving living conditions.
It would seem, however, that at least in the women's case we might
expect to see the entry of new societies. The obvious conclusion though
is the now completely apparent security of fraternity and sorority life on
the Stanford campus. â€”D.L.M.
