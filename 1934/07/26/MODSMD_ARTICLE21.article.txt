The Delgian Pro Arte String Quartet, brought to Stanford through
1 lie* sponsorship of Mrs. Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge, will present the last
recital of its Beethoven cycle tomorrow. Tickets to this performance were
gone by noon of the second day they were made available to the general
public, as were those for the concert last week. The earlier concerts were
as eagerly attended.
The quartet is acknowledged to be the best of its kind in the world,
eminently fitted to give a presentation such as the Beethoven cycle. Mem
bers of Stanford's summer coloify and their friends are indebted to Mrs.
Coolidge for her interest, which, in making possible the series, has
brought to many a new and more complete appreciation of the immortal
I'eet ho ven.
It is with this thought in mind—that Stanford will, through the very
means of such sponsorship as that of Mrs. Coolidge, finally reach the
goal of an established and recognized school of music—that the members
of the University extend their thanks and appreciation to Mrs. Coolidge
and an an revoir to the members of a most excellent quartet. —A.M.
