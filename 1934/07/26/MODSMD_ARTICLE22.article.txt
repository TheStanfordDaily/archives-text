# Protect the Honor Code!
## 
### 
Willi mid-quarter examinations at hand, members of tbe Student
Councils are anxious that people on the campus for the first time fully
understand the meaning of the Stanford Honor Code.
The idea is not the product of professors' minds. It was instituted
by the students for their own good. In the words of The Stanford
Handbook, "Honorable conduct in academic work is the spirit of con
duct at Stanford University."
F.very student automatically subscribes to the code when he enters
the I'niversity, and it is to his own advantage to turn in the names of
cheaters, for a grade secured by unfair means raises the class average.
Il is a matter in which every student, young or old, should manifest
an active interest. â€”T.R.L.
