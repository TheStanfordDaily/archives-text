# Brains in Government
## 
### 
One of the major tendencies of the "New Deal" has been toward an
increase in educated men in government. President Roosevelt has shown
a respect for the opinions of college professors and intellectual theorists
to such an extent that the policies of the new order have been formu
lated largely by really educated men. Such a policy is vitally important
in chartering a future course for a nation with the complex problems
which face America. We need all the brains possible.
Apart, however, from the value derived from the use of the abilities
of these trained men is another fundamental and basic contribution to
llie working of our system of government as it is today. lÂ»y injecting
brains into the government we find, as an inevitable accompaniment to
those brains, prestige. Prestige, in itself, means little more than respect,
btit for respect our government officers is an important thing; it is one of
the tonics business needs in these days of sickness. If we increase the
respect of the people of our government we shall find an increase in con
fidence in all fields, a necessary prerequisite to business recovery.
Still another value will be achieved by increasing the prestige of gov
ernment officers: there will be a tendency to attract still better men to
governmental activity. In the past, because of the taint added to govern
mental participation and politics in general by crooked politicians, men
of high caliber have turned from holding public office to other fields
where public respect was an added incentive to work. --J.YV.II.
