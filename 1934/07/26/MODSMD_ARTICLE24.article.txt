# BEN EASTMAN RUNS HALF MILE IN 1:50 AS AMERICANS WIN
## U.S. Team Caps All Firsts From Swedes 
### 
Featuring a clean sweep over a Swe
dish tearp by the touring American
trackman, Ben Eastman ran away from
his competition Tuesday at Stockholm
to turn in an 800 meter run in the time
of 1 minute 50 seconds flat.
In approaching within two-tenths of
a second of the world's record on his
first trial on foreign soil, Stanford's
great runner became the only heralded
American champion to really come
throughâ€”after Bill Bonthron of Prince
ton had lost to Oxford's Jack Lovelock,
and the American track squad' in Ger
many had taken consistent lickings from
competition there.
The Americans won the first paces of
thfc meet. Cornelius Johnson of Los
Angeles took the high jump at 6 feet
6% inches; Glen Hardin captured the
400 meters in 47.8 seconds; Eulace Pea
cock of Temple University took the 100
meters in 10.6; Bob Kane of Cornell
won the 200 meters in 21.8; and Percy
Beard hurdled to an easy win in the
120 highs in 14.5 seconds.
The prowess of Bill Corbus, Stan
ford's captain of the all-American
Board's 1933 team, still was recognized
when the football fans of the nation
voted to name the team of 1933 college
seniors who would play the Chicago
Bears, champion professional team, at
Soldier's Field, Chicago, August 31.
Corbus was chosen as a guard on the
squad of twenty-six players elected by
popular vote.
Though centering in the Mid-West
and sponsored by the Chicago Tribune,
the vote gave Coast football talent a
very generous nod in naming six others
besides Corbus on the team. Rosenberg
and Griffith, Southern California;
Mikulak, Oregon; Schwammel, Oregon
State; Smith, Washington; and Canri
nus, St. Mary's, were the other Coast
men named. Corbus drew 25,909 votes
from all over the nation.
Last year's swimming captain at
Southern California, Bud Brown, was
a visitor at Encina pools yesterday,
working out leisurely and getting a rest
in the warm sun. He is a teammate of
Gilhula and others of the Trojan squad
which placed second to Michigan in the
National Collegiate swim meet late last
spring.
