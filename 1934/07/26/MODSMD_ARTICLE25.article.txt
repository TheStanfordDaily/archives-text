# Bacon Charms Audience At Tuesday Piano Recital
## 
### 
Many people sat in the dance studio
of the Women's Gymnasium Tuesday
night to listen to Ernst Bacon's piano
recital, and they showed a great deal of
satisfaction, demanding a series of en
cores of his presentation of Chopin,
Bach, Brahms, and Mozart.
Impressive technical powers in pre
senting such numbers as the Mozart C
Minor Fantasy, the Brahms F Minor
Sonata, the Bach Chaconne, and a
Chopin Nocturne more than compen
sated any lack of showmanship in Ba
con's repetoire. Bacon's own composi
tions were included to some extent but
overcrowding of the program made it
necessary to eliminate some of the num
bers which were expected. The young
pianist, who is also a teacher and a
choral conductor, delighted the audi
ence, however, with the substitution of
short, unnamed selections which he
xendered with subtlety.
