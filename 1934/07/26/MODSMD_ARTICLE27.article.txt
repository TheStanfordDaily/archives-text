# STANFORD MEETS S.F.U. IN SECOND DEBATE OVER KYA
## Grantier Takes Negative Side On Socialized Medicine Question 
### 
"Resolved: That California Should
Adopt a System of Socialized Medi
cine" will be the question for the de
bate between Stanford and the Univer
sity of San Francisco to be held at 2
o'clock next Monday afternoon over
KYA, San Francisco.
The debate, sponsored by the San
Francisco Bar Association, will be the
second time Stanford debaters have par
ticipated in the series of the Intercolle
giate Forum. Bob Grantier, member
of the Men's Council and veteran de
bater, will represent Stanford in up
holding the negative side of the ques
tion.
The debaters will argue as to whether
or not the state should provide facilities
for Ihe great number of middle-class
people who cannot afford adequate
medical aid. It is asserted that the
wealthy can afford good medical care
and that the poor can receive attention
at county hospitals, but that the average
man cannot afford sufficient care, nor
can he permit himself to accept the aid
given the indigent.
