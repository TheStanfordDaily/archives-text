### 
Nathan Van Patten, director of thp
University Libraries, recently returned
from an eastern trip which took him to
Washington, New York, Boston, Water
bury, Vt., Montreal, Quebec, and Chi
cago.
Mr. Van Patten reports that through
an exchange arrangement with the
American Antiquarian Society of Wor
cester, Mass., the Stanford Library has
acquired a number of valuable early
American newspapers, including the
New York Times (1854-1865), the Na
tional Intelligencer (1803-1830), the
Columbian Sentinel (1798-1825), the
Boston Gazette (1804-1816), the Inde
pendent Chronicle (1799-1818), the
Richmond Inquirer (1817-1834), the
Honolulu Pacific Commercial Adver
tiser (1856-1863), and Honolulu Poly
nesia (1849-1857).
Every effort is being made to build
up the library's collections of American
and foreign by the acquisi
tion of originals as well as by the copy
ing of files in other libraries through
the use of photostat and by reproduc
tion on moving-picture film, Mr. Van
Patten said yesterday. The library now
has equipment both for the making of
film copies and for the projection of
the reproductions.
At Waterbury, Vt., Mr. Van Patten
visited Will S. Monroe, Stanford, '94.
Mr. Monroe is now retired and is de
voting himself to the extension of the
mountain trails in the vicinity of his
Couching Lion Farm, and to the com
pletion of a book upon Walt Whitman.
He has presented his Whitman collec
tion to the Stanford University Library.
This collection is one of the most com
plete in existence. It includes all of the
editions of "Leaves of Grass" with the
exception of the first editions of Whit
man's. It also includes all known trans
lations of "Leaves of Grass" with the
more impoi-tant biographical and criti
cal publications of Whitman interest
and many photographs and manuscripts.
The library director also reports that
during his eastern trip important ex
change relations were established with
I the School of Business Administration
| Library at Harvard University, Boston.
| He purchased sixty-eight volumes of
| Canadian legal material needed to com
plete the files of the Law Library.

Every effort is being made to build
up the library's collections of American
and foreign by the acquisi
tion of originals as well as by the copy
ing of files in other libraries through
the use of photostat and by reproduc
tion on moving-picture film, Mr. Van
Patten said yesterday. The library now
has equipment both for the making of
film copies and for the projection of
the reproductions.
At Waterbury, Vt., Mr. Van Patten
visited Will S. Monroe, Stanford, '94.
Mr. Monroe is now retired and is de
voting himself to the extension of the
mountain trails in the vicinity of his
Couching Lion Farm, and to the com
pletion of a book upon Walt Whitman.
He has presented his Whitman collec
