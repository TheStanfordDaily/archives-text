# Alumnus Hurt In Auto Crash Oil Palm Drive
## Murray Holloway, '33, Dozes On Lone Drive Home From S.F. Visit Accident May Prove Fatal To Oil Geologist 
### 
Returning to the campus from San
Francisco early Saturday morning,
Murray Samuel Holloway, Jr., Class of
1933 and graduate student in geology
last year, turned into Palm Drive from
El Camino Real, on the last stretch of
his journey home, nodded, dozed, and
lost control of his car, which struck a
concrete culvert and turned over to be
the first serious automobile accident at
Stanford this summer.
Holloway, who was visiting friends
on the campus during the week-end,
borrowed a car from E. R. Fritsch, a
fraternity brother at the S.A.E. house,
with the intention of visiting in San
Francisco Friday evening.
Drowses at Wheel
Returning late, he drowsed at the
wheel with what may be fatal results.
An ambulance from the Tinney Fu
neral Home was called immediately
after the accident, which occurred at
3:30 a.m. near the entrance to the Palo
Alto Hospital drive. Examination at
the hospital revealed a fractured skull,
a badly shattered arm, and severe lace
rations. His condition yesterday was
reported as unchanged—serious, but not
necessarily critical —with the possibil
ity, howevei', of reaching a critical stage
at any time. Amputation of the arm
may be necessary.
Father Arrives
Lieutenant M. S. Holloway, Sr., father
of the injured, arrived as soon as pos
sible after the accident by plane from
San Diego.
Holloway, who at present is an oil
geologist with the Honolulu Oil Com
pany, was the only person in the car at
the time of the accident. The machine
was badly wrecked.
