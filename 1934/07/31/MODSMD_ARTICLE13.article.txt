the present administration at Washing
ton, W. C. Mullendore, executive vice
president of the Southern California
Edison Company, spoke before the joint
session of the Western School of Com
mercial Secretaries and Trade Exec
utes yesterday in the Encina Commons.
Titled "Romanticism and Realism in
Economics," Mullendore's energetic
speech included many thrusts and
slashes at the Democratic administra
tion and at current public opinion. Mul
lendore emphasized "American individ
ualism" with all the sincerity of a Hoo
ver slump speaker in 1932. The speaker
pointed to the profit motive as being the
only effective incentive to good business

temporary "romanticism" in thought.
"Thrift and common sense are homely
; virtues, but they are the things we
| need," he said.

' to dwell upon what the speaker be
-1 lieved to be the three popular miscon
| ceptions which are held as causes for
i the present economic mess: "false lead
ers, profit motive, and distribution of
wealth."
Utilities director Mullendore ques
tioned the false leaders misbelief, but
resolutely stood behind the profit mu
-1 live and today's mal-distribution of
! wealth. He said that "today's romantic
ideas threaten the very foundation of
: the greatest civilization that the world
has ever known." Mr. Mullendore be

i ning and control in industry is "just
words, just words."

speaker said, "These facts are being

Mullendore branded modern beliefs
j as "false and misleading doctrines."
After the speaker had been heartily
applauded by his audience, the meet
