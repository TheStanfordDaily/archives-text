# The Red Menace
## 
### 
Recent strikes and violent outbreaks in the United States indicate to
some degree the growth of the Communistic element in our country.
This group is becoming larger in the United States, as it is all over the
world, through the medium of their own press and strongly organized
central control.
Stalin is the" dictatorial leader of this world-wide movement, and his
orders must be and arc strictly carried out. There are more than fifty
"red" newspapers published right in our own country, and it is through
this channel that the leader issues his orders to an immense population
of followers.
Russian diplomacy says, "The Soviet desires to live at peace with the
world. Communism and capitalism can live amicably together in a world
big enough for both."
These statements are untrue. Communism is at war with the non-
Communist world everywhere. Their latest paper slogan reads: For
ward to World Revolution."
It is our conviction that the government must inform itself regarding
the details of this "red" plot in the United States, and arm itself with
the necessary power for defense of our Constitution and democratic
form of government. The Moscow-directed agitation and action, which
are indicated in their newspapers, break the Litvinoff pledge which was
a condition of American recognition of Soviet Russia. â€”J. 11.(1.
