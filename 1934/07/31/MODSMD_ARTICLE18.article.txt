### 
1 Live you seen "Epic Sinclair's" stump wagon on wheels wliicli has
attached itself to the local campaign headquarters in Palo Alto? It does
seem hard to believe that such publicity measures and an organization
with the outward appearance that Sinclair's has is going to draw votes
from among our heretofore rather discriminating students and pro
fessors.
I "nlike continental universities, American institutions have up to now
been largely on .the more conservative sides of our political questions.
I'arehcaded student movements have been few indeed in this country.
Apparently, however, a change is at hand. "Ilull-Sessions" on the
campus today show remarkable evidence of unusual support for the
"Sunkist saint" who promises to end poverty for California.
The swelled Democratic registrations, coupled with a Socialist sup
port which it is impossible to appraise and which, many contend, is
stronger than it appear on the surface due to the domination (tip to the
present, at least) of the conservative element in the community, Sinclair
truly stands in a position to receive surprising local backings—D.L.M.
