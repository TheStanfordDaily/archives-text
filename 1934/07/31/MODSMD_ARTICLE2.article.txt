# Auto Liability Plan Outlined
## 
### 
A new plan of automobile compen
sation was the subject of Professor
Lowell Turrentine's speech on ' Auto
Accidents: Commission Instead of
Court" on KPO at 7:45 o'clock last
night. Turrentine is ?u professor of law.
"The bold proposal of the Ballantine
Committee is that the common-law rule
of liability based on negligence be
scraped, and that all motorists be re
quired not only to carry insurance, but
to make compensation out of that in
surance for every injury they cause
regardless of fault," declared Turren
tine.
Plan a Remedy
He suggested the plan of the Ballan
tine Committee as a remedy to the
great economic loss which is incurred
through motor vehicle injuries. He, said
that the loss, which is usually over 50
per cent, falls upon the victim and his
family and upon the hospitals, doctors,
and tradesmen whose bills go unpaid.
"The Ballantine plan is the result of
(he research of a committee appointed
by Columbia University five years ago
under the leadership of Arthur A. Bal
lantine of New York," explained Pro
fessor Turrentine.
This plan would proceed along prin
ciples similar to the Workmen's Com
pensation Acts.
Plan Would Aid Courts
"The automobile compensation plan
would take this whole mass of litiga
tion out of the courts. All claims would
be adjudicated by a commission after
hearings by its examiners," Turrentine
went on to say. "To lessen the cost of
insurance a schedule of disability bene
fits would have to be framed."
"It is better that injured persons be
assured of some reasonable compensa
tion in all cases than that the occa
sional plaintiff, who happens to have
been the victim of a wealthy and negli
gent defendant, should come out with
a handsome recompense," he added.
Professor Turrentine estimates that a
million persons a year are injured in
motor accidents and over thirty thou
sand are killed. The proportion of mo
torists who carry liability insurance is
not quite one out of three.
