PRO ARTE CONCERT
In the Dance Studio
Playing a farewell concert last Fri
day in the dance studio of the Wom
en's Gymnasium, the Pro Arte String
Quartet concluded its series of six ren
ditions of the Beethoven Cycle, the first
complete rendition of the cycle on the
Pacific Coast. Presented through the
courtesy of Mrs. Elizabeth Sprague
Coolidge, the concerts were so popular
that at the final one a large number of
extra seats were placed in the patio of
the Women's Gym, and thus an audi
ence of over 1,000 was able to attend.
The Quartet in C Sharp Minor, Opus
131, was the first played, with its six
movements uninterrupted by pauses.

Like Opus 132 (the first number on the
previous Friday), this quartet is a mon
ument to Beethoven's infinite variety of
expression. From the Allegros and An
dantes to the Presto, and back to the
Adagio and Allegro—what range of
powers this covers!
The beauties of the Opus 135 were of
startling quality, the often modern
sounding dissonances being played with
compelling vehemence by the musi
cians. The Vivace of the first movement
and the Grave of the last were ample
evidence of the distance traveled by
Beethoven from the first of his quartets
to these last. And the unbelievable
delicacy of the playing of the Allegro
of the last movement left this listener

transported.
Prepared as one was for the grandeur
of the Grande Fugue, it was yet more
impressive than anticipated. One heard
the remark, "A little over my head,"
afterwards, and there are Beethoven
comentators who stale that it is diffi
cult at the first or second hearings; but
if it is difficult in spots, it is only be
cause, being unfamiliar with the themes,
one is slow to grasp the magnificence
of their treatment. It is in any case an
unforgettable experience to hear this
great work.
Cecil Gray, in his history of music,
says the most striking and significant
feature of the modern "attitude toward
Beethoven is the "growing recognition
of the supreme importance of Bee
thoven's last wox'ks, and the posthumous
string quartets in particular, and the
realization that they should be regarded
as not only his finest works but also as
the culminating point of his artistic
development."
The execution of these quartets has
been somewhat like the performance of
a great actress. One forgets that she is
acting, and with the Pro Arte Quartet
one forgets that there is any human or
mechanical means intervening between
the listener and the pure music as con
ceived by Beethoven.
The personnel of this world-famous
quartet is: Alphonse Onnou, first vio
lin; Laurent Halleux, second violin;
Germain Prevost, viola; and Robert
Maas, violincello.

delicacy of the playing of the Allegro
of the last movement left this listener

transported.
Prepared as one was for the grandeur
of the Grande Fugue, it was yet more
impressive than anticipated. One heard
the remark, "A little over my head,"
afterwards, and there are Beethoven
comentators who stale that it is diffi
cult at the first or second hearings; but
if it is difficult in spots, it is only be
cause, being unfamiliar with the themes,
one is slow to grasp the magnificence
of their treatment. It is in any case an
unforgettable experience to hear this
great work.
Cecil Gray, in his history of music,
says the most striking and significant
feature of the modern "attitude toward
Beethoven is the "growing recognition
of the supreme importance of Bee
thoven's last wox'ks, and the posthumous
string quartets in particular, and the
realization that they should be regarded
as not only his finest works but also as
the culminating point of his artistic
development."
The execution of these quartets has
been somewhat like the performance of
a great actress. One forgets that she is
acting, and with the Pro Arte Quartet
one forgets that there is any human or
mechanical means intervening between
the listener and the pure music as con
ceived by Beethoven.
The personnel of this world-famous
quartet is: Alphonse Onnou, first vio
lin; Laurent Halleux, second violin;
Germain Prevost, viola; and Robert
Maas, violincello.

PRO ARTE CONCERT
In the Dance Studio
Playing a farewell concert last Fri
day in the dance studio of the Wom
en's Gymnasium, the Pro Arte String
Quartet concluded its series of six ren
ditions of the Beethoven Cycle, the first
complete rendition of the cycle on the
Pacific Coast. Presented through the
courtesy of Mrs. Elizabeth Sprague
Coolidge, the concerts were so popular
that at the final one a large number of
extra seats were placed in the patio of
the Women's Gym, and thus an audi
ence of over 1,000 was able to attend.
The Quartet in C Sharp Minor, Opus
131, was the first played, with its six
movements uninterrupted by pauses.

Like Opus 132 (the first number on the
previous Friday), this quartet is a mon
ument to Beethoven's infinite variety of
expression. From the Allegros and An
dantes to the Presto, and back to the
Adagio and Allegro—what range of
powers this covers!
The beauties of the Opus 135 were of
startling quality, the often modern
sounding dissonances being played with
compelling vehemence by the musi
cians. The Vivace of the first movement
and the Grave of the last were ample
evidence of the distance traveled by
Beethoven from the first of his quartets
to these last. And the unbelievable
delicacy of the playing of the Allegro
of the last movement left this listener

transported.

of the Grande Fugue, it was yet more
