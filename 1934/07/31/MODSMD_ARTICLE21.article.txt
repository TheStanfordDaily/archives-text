"Stanford would be an ideal univer
sity for the development of a depart
ment of Art History," said Professor
Kurt F. Reinhardt, of the Germanic
Languages Department, in an interview
yesterday. Professor Reinhardt has
studied art and philosophy at the Uni
versities of Munich, Heidelberg, and
Freiburg.
"Harvard, Wisconsin, Oregon, Michi
gan, and other universities have suc
cessful departments of art history," he
pointed out. "All of these colleges be
lieve that such courses should be given
from the standpoint of the integration
of the university curriculum rather
than from the viewpoint of mere tech
nical training," he added.
The principal task for American in
stitutions that teach art is to utilize
America and its scenery for the creation
of art, Professor Heinhardt believes. He
thinks that Americans should cease
their exclusive imitation and cultiva
tion of European art forms, since it has
proven detrimental to an indigenous
art of social significance.
"Due to the fact that art today has
lost significance, an artist is an isolated
human without an audience," said Pro
fessor Reinhardt. "The artist is fre
quently a bohemian, a crank, or both.
Art has to grow out of actual experi
ence and life."
Professor Reinhardt thinks that an
art seminar to take up specific prob
lems of art history and a series of period
courses in art history might be arranged
whenever there is a sufficient demand
for such courses.
