# AMERICANS CAPTURE SWEDISH TRACK MEET AS EASTMAN SHINES
## Five and Six Hundred Meter Records Crash 
### 
That the American squad has not
lost a single event in Swedish-American
competition at Stockholm this month, is
a feature which has had to take second
place to the records of individual per
formers—particularly , those of Stan
ford's Ben Eastman.
Two world's records in two days this
week-end are Ben's most recent ef
forts—in the 500 and 600 meter runs.
His time of 1 minute 2.8 seconds for
the shorter distance cut two-tenths of
a second from the record; while his
1 minute 18.4 seconds for 600 meters
lowered the world record. This distance
is not officially recognized by the In
ternational Federation of Amateur
Athletics which approves the records.
No less brilliant was Glen Hardin's
record of 50.6 seconds for the 400 meter
hurdles, set the same day. The Loui
siana boy's time for this most gruelling
of all races cut one and one-fifth sec
onds from his unofficial record of 51.8
seconds set at the National A.A.U. meet
in Milwaukee, June 30.
In addition, Percy Beard hurdled 120
yards of high barriers in 14.3 seconds
to approach his unofficial woi'ld record
of 14.2 seconds, and to clip the official
record of 14.4 seconds. Americans Tor
rance, Peacock, Johnson, Kane, and
Bothron won their events in less spec
tacular fashion. Bonthron's 2 minutes
28 seconds for 1,000 meters was 5 sec
onds short of the world mark, while his
3 minutes 55.3 seconds for 1,500 meters
falls far short of his own unofficial
record of 3 minutes 48.8 seconds.
