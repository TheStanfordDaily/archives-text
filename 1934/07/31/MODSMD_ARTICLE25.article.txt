# "The Doctor's Wife" To Be Given Friday Night
## 
### 
Harold Helvenston's latest produc
tion, "The Doctor's Wife," will be pre
sented under the auspices of the Com
mittee on Public Exercises Friday
night at 8:30 o'clock in the Assembly
Hall.
The world premiere of this new play
by Eric Linders is to feature Dr. Mar
gery Bailey in the role of Mrs. Harker,
the doctor's wife. Dr. Bailey, who will
be remembered for numerous dramatic
appearances on the Stanford stage, was
last seen in the Sword and Sandals
reading of "The Circle" earlier this
quarter.
William Gwinn, who is to play Dr.
Harker, has appeared in many Sword
and Sandals readings, and also played a
leading role in "Distant Drums" earlier
this year.
The love interest is furnished by
Shelley Smith as Elaine Harker and
Glenn Reed as young Dr. Wilson. Miss
Smith first appeared in "Distant
Drums," and later played a leading role
in "Three Cornered Moon." Reed is a
member of Helvenston's acting class.
Others in the cast include Frank H.
O'Neill, former business manager of
the University of San Francisco Play
ers and author of a number of popular
radio dramatic series; Marjorie Meyer,
Roger Komsthoeft, Thomas Slattery,
Waldron Wilson, a youthful off-campus
actor; and "Booze," a Boston bull ter
rier.
Because seats are not reserved, and
there will be a prompt 8:30 o'clock cur
tain, the doors of the Assembly Hall
will be opened at 7:45 o'clock. Late
comers will be held in the foyer until
the end of the first act.
