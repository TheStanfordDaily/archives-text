# Stanford Men Prominent In Many Fields of Sports
## 
### 
Stanford students in various fields of
sport are standing out quite promi
nently. Bill Seward, tennis ace of last
year's freshmen, showed vast improve
ment in his game by upsetting in the
western Canadian championships Fri
day the seeded Portland star, Wayne
Sabin. Sabin has been ranking higher
in Northwestern championships than
Seward until the Stanford boy finally
caught and pasted him in a torrid- five
set match—3-6, 4-6, 6-1, 6-4, 6-3.
Meanwhile five Stanfordites, John
Cahill, Charles Burkett, Neil Ruge, Ed
Taaffe, and Edward ' Bud" Maples were
enjoying the sport of mountain climb
ing in the High Sierras with the Sierra
Club Summer Outing Party. Cahill,
who is experienced in the sport, re
cently led a select party of the Sierrans
up two of Yosemite's highest peaks—
Lyell and MacClure—in the same day;
Dr. Millikan, eminent Cal Tech phy
sicist, who with his wife and five chil
dren is on the outing, was among those
Cahill led.
