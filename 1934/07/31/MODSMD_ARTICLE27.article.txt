### 
The Charlotte Ashly Felton Library, i
established by Mrs. Kate Felton Elkins
in memory of her mother, is one of the
lesser known cultural centers on the
campus, and one with which summer (
students are not well acquainted.
It is located on the third story of
the main library directly over the Hoo
ver War Library reading room, and is j
open on all days of the week except ;
Saturday and Sunday, from 2 to 4
o'clock in the afternoon.
The Felton room might be termed a (
collector's library, in that it contains 1
first editions, limited editions, and
handsomely bound books and manu- j
scripts. The room is furnished in an 1
atmosphere representing the cultural
background of such a collection.
With easy chairs and walls and drapes
of a deep rose color, it presents an ap
pearance far removed from a strict
academic atmosphere. It is a room for j
relaxation and enjoyment of art for 1
art's sake alone.
Books cannot be taken from this li
brary because of their value, but all j
students are welcome to come there and j
read. Mrs. Elkins gave the initial col- ,
lection of books and now makes yearly
additions, which always keeps the Fel
ton Library complete and up-to-date.
