# Dr. Wilbur Receives Word Of Stanford Fund Increase
## 
### 
The number of Stanford students who
will receive honorary rewards during
the next academic year from the Fed
eral Emergency Relief Administration
for doing socially desirable work has
been increased from 10 to 12 per cent j
of the enrollment as of October 15, 1933,
according to an announcement just re
ceived by President Wilbur.
The total funds to be paid to students
will be approximately $6,000 a month,
since about 400 full-time students are
continuously eligible at an average rale
of $15 a month. No student will be per
mitted to earn in excess of $20 a month.
The new regulations not only provide
that needy students may be paid for
doing clerical, library, and research
work, as was the case last year, but per
mits the assignment of students to ex
tension, adult education, recreation,
"and other activities that increase the
usefulness of (he college to the com
munity."
A provision that is apparently aimed
at helping students who were not able
to attend college last year,/ as well as
those who were not ready for college at
that time, is one which provides that at ,
least half the funds shall be paid to \
students who were not regularly en
rolled in any university during Janu
ary, 1934. :
The primary purpose of the relief |
administration is to increase the rium- j
ber of young men and women going to
college. The regulations provide that
the available jobs shall be allocated be
tween men and women in proportion to
(lie enrollment of each sex in the par- j
ticular school.
