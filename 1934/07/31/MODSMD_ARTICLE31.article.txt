# Stanford Golfer May Win Amateur Title
## 
### 
When Jack Hoerner, present Univer
sity titleholder beat Rodney Bliss 3 and
2 to enter the semi-final round of the
Nebraska State Championship at
Omaha. Friday, he boosted himself into
a position second only to Lawson Little !
in Stanford golf.
Bliss was second only to Little among
the amateurs in last month's National
open, so Hoerner's upset victory ranks
him with the best amateurs of the j
country; and if he maintains his pres- j
ent pace Stanford should be represented j
by three golfers with a good chance of
copping the National Amateur title late ,
next month. Don Edwards, who led the
early qualifiers last .year, but blew up
the second day and was eliminated, is
a much steadier player than he was
then. With Little and Hoerner he
should make quite an impression in the
coming championship.
