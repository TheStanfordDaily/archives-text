# Dr. von Klenze Speaks To Commonwealth Club
## 
### 
Dr. Camillo von Klenze, visiting pro
fessor of German, spoke before the Sun
Francisco Commonwealth Club Friday
on "Main Currents in the Intellectual
Life of Present Germany." The pro
fessor, who is chairman of the commit
tee on cultural relations between
America and Germany, said, "One-sided
hostility toward Germany may con
tribute to her collapse. We in this coun
try are too apt at the moment to allow
our emotional bias to govern our judg
ment of Germany."
Dr. von Klenze pointed that collapse
in Germany would definitely affect
America because it would help create
chaos in Europe. He held that Ameri
cans do not understand the situation in
Germany because of this country's
steady success up to 1929 is contrasted
to Germany's periods of advance and
recurrent defeats.
