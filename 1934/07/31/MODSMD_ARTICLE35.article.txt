# Quick Thinking Saves Three at Rail Crossing
## 
### 
. Howard Story Taylor, instructor in |
mining engineering at Stanford; J. E. i
McDowell, academic secretary at Stan- j
ford and executive secretary of the ,
Stanford Alumni Association; and Dave j
Clark, Palo Alto architect, were nearly
run down by a Southern Pacific train
last Thursday night at the Santa Clara
Alviso road intersection.
Taylor, the driver, had brought his
car to a stop to wait for the approach
ing train to pass. The three were sit
ting there chatting when their car was |
struck from behind by a truck driven
by Arsen Joseph Abren and forced
across the track an instant before the I
train roared past.
The three were en route to San Jose
to attend a meeting of the Santa Clara
County Boy Scout Council. The train
was northbound.
According to Taylor the truck driver
explained that his brakes had failed to
hold.
In the fraction of a second which
Taylor had to make a decison following i
the collision with the truck, he decided
that he could not hall his car short of
the tracks but did have a chance to roll
across the rails ahead ol' the train.
