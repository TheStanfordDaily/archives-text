# Jackson to Give Business Views
## 
### 
In his talk on "Business and the New
Deal" in the dance studio of the Wom
en's Gymnasium tonight at 8 o'clock,
Dean J. Hugh Jackson, of the Graduate
School of Business, will present first
hand information of business conditions
and the reaction of business men to the
governmental innovations. He will
analyze present business conditions,
make some forecasts as to the imme
diate future of business, and report the
attitude of the country toward the New
Deal as he found it during trips through
15 states late this spring.
Dean Jackson foresees lessened cor
poration earnings during the third quar
ter, as compared with the second quar
ter, but with some pickup during the
fourth quarter. Somewhat higher com
modity prices may be expected during
the autumn, he believes, and labor
troubles will continue.
In some sections Dean Jackson found
considerable dissatisfaction with the
New Deal policies, and in other com
munities enthusiasm for the program,
or parts of the program.
