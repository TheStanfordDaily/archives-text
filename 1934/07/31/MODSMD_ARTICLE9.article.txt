# 200 Co-eds Assured Rooms As Court Nears Completion
## 
### 
Some of Stanford's now contingent of
co-eds next year wiil be housed in
Lagunita Court, newest addition to the
compus dormitories. Designed in ac
cord with the general scheme at Stan
ford of old Mission architecture, La
gunita Court combines beauty of con
struction with the latest methods of
building.
The four housing units and the din
ing hall form three sides of a rectangle,
with the administration building clos
ing the front. Two of the dormitories
face Santa Teresa and are in general
line with the administration olfices,
with which they are connected by cov
ered walks. The other two are ar
ranged at right angles running back
from the street, with the dining halls
closing the back of the quadrangle thus
formed. Each of the units will house
approximately 50 people, and the two
dining halls can handle 100 each. The
four domitories have separate lobbies
for social gatherings.
Outside stairways from the second
.floor of each unit lead down into the
central courtyard, which is being land
scaped by Mr. E. Leslie Kiler of Palo
Alto. Old oak trees are being trans
planted into the patio, and olive trees
will be planted soon, arranged around
the fountain and leading up to the ter
race in front of the dining balls, giving
the atmosphere of an old Spanish Mis
sion in early California. Walks in the
patio will converged on the dining halls.

| The construction of the buildings
: utilizes the most modern principles of
architecture. Steel frames are being
used instead of the usual wood, with
welders replacing the carpenters. The
1 frames used in the building were made
I in San Francisco shops in the largest
! sections practical foi transportation,
and were assembled complete on the
i grounds.
Although not fireproof due to the in
stallation of wooden floors, the build
ings are much more fire resistant than
I those of wooden construction, as is tes
tified by a 30 per cent lower insurance
' rate on them.
Steel frame construction has proven
itself to be much safer in earthquakes
than wooden framing. Strains and
| stresses are difficult to predict in wood
: and nail construction, whereas with
steel frames and welded joints they can
be figured accurately.
Another advantage is the lack of
! shrinkage, which with unseasoned wood
often causes the plaster to crack on
buildings. The necessity of pushing
i the building program would have made
| it difficult to secure seasoned wood for
I the frames.
Having the frames made up in San
Francisco shops rather than on the
i ground greatly reduced the cost of con
struction and also reduced the time
necessary to complete construction.
The dormitories will be open at the
j beginning of the fall quarter.
