# Stanford Faces Tough Football Season In Fall
## First Scheduled Game Is With San Jose State, September 22 Play Seven Straight Games Against Hard Rivals 
### 
A football* schedule, which in the days
of over-emphasis would have becji
called "positively suicidal" and which
in this clay of strenuous competition is
still "plenty tough," awaits the Stan
ford football varsity that returns to the
campus September 15 to begin training
for the fall campaign.
Beginning a week after official prac
tice starts, the competitive season starts
out ambitiously, with San Jose State,
27 to 0 victims last year, as the first op
ponent. Last year the Spartans cut
quite a place in the far Western Con
ference and from all indications the
battle in the staflium September 22
will find little advantage for an Indian
varsity with only a week's practice be
hind it.
By comparison with the remaining
games, the first, tough as it is, will be
little more than a warm-up. For seven
straight Saturday's thereafter Stanford
must engage teams of national reputa
tion, including four Pacific Coast Con
ference opponents.
Many Hard Games
Starting with Santa Clara on Septem
ber 29, Stanford must face in consecu
tive games of Oregon State, North
western, San Francisco, Southern Cali
fornia, U.C.L.A., and Washington. And
whether even Stanford's potentially
great team can stand up under this
strain is questionable. In addition to
great playing skill it will require excep
tional fight and staying power to avoid
a slump similar to that which hit the
1&32 varsity in the course of a less stren
uous schedule. Fans will remember
that even this hard fighting outfit, after
winning its five initial games, collapsed
on three successive Saturdays before
U.S.C., Washington, and U.C.L.A.
Capable reserves three deep on this
year's team arc a guarantee, barring
accidents that the 1934 varsity will prob
ably not have to fight itself out before
the finish of the season.
The Washington game in the stadium
November 10 will complete a seven
weeks' seige before a lull in the pro
gram—the Olympic Club game—al
lows a slight let-down. But the "old
men" who perform for the Winged "O"
have more than once upset Stanford
where the let-down has been too great.
Big Game
Then comes the fight to retain the
Stanford Ax? in its display case in the
Cellar for another year when the var
sity travels to Berkeley November 24
to meet California.
No post-season games are in pros
pect, so barring an invitation to the
Hose Bowl, the Indian gridders wjill end
their season at Berkeley. But lack of
post-season games will not detract from
(he flavor of intersectional rivalry in
Stanford's prog ra m — Northwestern
travels to the Coeist to stage a game with
Stanford which will bring the potential
champions of the two great conferences
into early season combat, October 13.
