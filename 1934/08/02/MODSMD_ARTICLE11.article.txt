# Dean Jackson Tells of NRA
## New Deal Not All Favorable To Business Judge 
### 
In his talk on '"Business and the
New Deal" in the dance studio of the
Women's Gymnasium last Tuesday
night, Dean J. Hugh Jackson, of the
Graduate School of Business, gave an
objective presentation of business con
ditions as they exist today, and related
the progress toward recovery made un
der the N.R.A.
According to Dean Jackson, there are
four major purposes of the New Deal
program: "To reduce unemployment, to
raise wages and increase purchasing
power, to raise prices to the 1926 level,
and to eliminate cut-throat competi
tion, child labor, and the sweat shop."
Under the N.R.A., he declared, confi
dence has been restored throughout the
country. However, unemployment has
not been decreased "and another win
ter with heavy unemployment is be
fore us."
Corporation earnings have been
greatly improved, Dean Jackson added,
although some businesses still operate
at a loss. Business failures are 35 per
cent less than they were in 1933.
"The attitude of the country toward
the New Deal," said Dean Jackson, "can
be placed in a nutshell. People are fa
vorable to the New Deal if they are
making money out of it; unfavorable if
they are not."
