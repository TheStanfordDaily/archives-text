If business men took over the govern
ment, all our ills would be cured, Roger
Miller, manager of the Southwest Divi
sion of the United States Chamber of
Commerce, yesterday told the joint ses
sion of the Western School for Commer
cial Secretaries and Trade Executives
in the Encina Commons.
Mr. Miller emphasized the fact that
the American business man has been
indifferent to the nation's welfare. "He
has not taken proper part in public af
fairs," he said.
"The need of government is manage
ment on business principlesâ€”more busi
ness in government and less government
in business," the speaker went on to
say. "American business has given the
United States a wider distribution of
wealth than has any other nation in the
world."
Hits Labor Politicians
Mr. Miller pointed out that labor has
shown its preference between the alter
natives of having organization, or of
letting the business man hire and fire
whom he pleases.
"There are only some three million
men and women in the American Fed
eration of Labor," said the speaker.
"The workers who remain out of this
group far exceed those who arc con
tained in it."
Mr. Miller asserted there are two
elements in the labor movement: the
professional organizers who see the
money rolling in to their own advan
tage from the organizing of fifteen or
twenty million workers paying monthly
dues, and certain politicians who are
thinking of the "workers' votes from a
strong labor group which may domi
nate national affairs In years-to come.
The employer and the employee, to a
great extent, arc friends who know and
understand each other, according to
Mr. Miller.
Reveals Business Problems
"The term 'liberal' belongs to the
business man," he declared. "He is
broad generous, contributes to good
causes, pays the salaries of those who
abuse him, and takes the abuse and
goes quietly on."
The speaker listed many questions
which he believes are before the Amer
ican business man today. Among them
are these: are savings and investments
to be assured a reasonable return? How
long are the proved economic laws of
supply and demand to be ignored? Arc
the business men ever to be rid of the
bogey of regimentation? Are the busi
ness men going to let a little group of
theorists control production, or are
these men going to expand further
through sound business principles,
greater production, and increased ad
vertising?
The other outstanding speech of the
day was by Frederic P. Woellner on
"Communism and Her Relatives" in
which the speaker revealed to his au
dience the growing menace of com
munism in the United States. Mr.
Woellner is from the University of Cal
ifornia at Los Angeles.
A baseball game between the secre
taries and the executives was played
in the afternoon on the freshman base
ball field. The game was followed by
a big barbecue on Angell Field and the
secretaries' hi-jinks in the Toyon Lobby
at 8 o'clock.
