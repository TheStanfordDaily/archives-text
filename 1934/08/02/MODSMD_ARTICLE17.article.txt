It is interesting to note that Krown Iniversity has discontinued the
degree of I'achelor of Philosophy, Drown having been the first in this
country to inaugurate it, and has dropped Latin or (ireek as an entrance
requirement. Classical language is no longer required of candidates for
the A. 15. degree.
Psychologists have demonstrated by experiment that the doctrine
of formal discipline, involving particularly the study of Latin and (ireek,
is based largely upon fallacy. I f there is any Ix?nefit from such so-called
mental discipline, it is to be found almost solely in the study of the exact
sciences, such as mathematics, chemistry, physics, and the like. In the
light of these developments it seems that I'rown has answered logically
and in keeping with the advance of education.
The reason for the elimination of the degree of bachelor of philosophy
is harder to discern. Jt would appear that, as a science, philosophy in
the past half-century has been left sadly behind. Science is by nature,
exact. Philosophy does not readily lend itself to scientific method, and
in consequence of this has fallen into the class of history; that is, it is
interesting as a relic of the past, of the pre-scientific age, so to speak.
Jn this day of hurry-up or fall-down-go-boom, we, evidently in accord
with I'rown, may suppose that the student who is to keep the pace has
no time to sit down and figure out what it's all about. —A.M.
