# Reduce the Green Fee
## 
### 
Stanford has a golf course of which every student may be proud. It
has been rated by many critics as one of the best courses in the country,
and yet, how often is it played by the average student?"
There is an old saying that golf is the rich man's game. Stanford
golf runs true to form by being the game for the rich man's son.
Students are encouraged to play at the (nominal) rate of $1 for 18
holes, provided, of course, you show your student body card. This little
piece of cardboard which tells the sad story of having already paid .$l4
community fees is the key to the very special price of .$1 for 18 holes.
An attractive rate of 50 cents is charged after 4 p.m. as a super-bargain
price—the rate, however, seems to be based on the theory that only thoste
who take long strides can possibly complete 18 holes before sundown.
Summer school students furnish the one exception, as they receive the
"breaks" of a long day.
Now, if it is the purpose of the golf course to provide a field of rec
reation to those who enjoy the game—why can't it be more available to
everybody by a reduction of prohibitive green fees? From a monetary
standpoint the I'niversity might even increase the volume enough to more
than offset the decrease per student. Ilow about a flat rate of 50 cents?
