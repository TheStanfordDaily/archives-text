# "The Doctor's Wife"
## 
### 
You needn't be hard up for entertainment to enjoy "The Doctor's
Wife" tomorrow night. It is lielvenston's only effort of the summer,
and as a premiere promises new scrip and cracks.
The cast smacks of experience and ability proven in past campus
productions. At least three merit being billed in boldface and the sup
porting case is equally good.
The play was written by a physician in answer to the favorable pub
lic reaction which Cable's "Men in White" received. Curtain will be at
8:30 o'clock and there is no admission charge, thanks to the Committee
on Public Exercises.
