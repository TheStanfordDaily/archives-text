# Reinhardt Talks on Art And Literature Thursday
## 
### 
"Art, Literature, and a Thesis" will
be the subject of a talk by Processor
Kurt F. Reinhardt, of the Germanic
Languages Department, before the
Stanford Philogical Association at 4:15
o'clock next Thursday, August 0, in the
Faculty Women's Clubhouse.
Professor Reinhardt will interpret the
theory of "art for art'? sake," especially
in the light of recent discussions and in
connection with the changes and the
social, economic, and political upheavals
in various countries and with respect
to the claims of the totalitarian state.
Professor Rcinhardt's talk will pre
sent tentative answers to the following
questions: Is a work of lilerature an
autonomous and self-sufficing organ
ism? How does a thesis affect the lit
erary or artistic value of a work of
literature? What is the relationship
that exists between aesthetic values and
moral values?
