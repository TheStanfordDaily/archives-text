setting from George Whitaker, one of
the foremost of the modern English
composers, and it will be given its first
performance as well.
The program will include songs which
cover the centuries from 1400 to 1800
and are representative of the drinking
songs, the folk songs, and traditional
songs of the period to which they be
long. Eight of these songs have been
especially set for Mr. Haddock by
George Whitaker.
Included in the program are the fol
lowing: Dumb, dumb, dumb; Dulcina;
The Nottingham Poacher; Oh thou man;
Watkyns Ale; Greenslceves; Lilli bur
lero; Bring us in good ale; Westron
Wynde; Now ponder well; Flaxen
cowboy; Golden slumbers; Fox and the
grapes; Vicar of Bray; Lord Piendall;
Cupid's Garden; Where be goin'?
The interest of the program will be
increased by the fact that Mr. Haddock,
who has made a study of, and has done
a great deal of research into these old
folk songs and ballads of England, will
say a few words ;<txmt each of them as
to where they came from,, how they
came to be written, and other special
points of interest before he sings them.
Mr. Haddock, who is principal of the
Leeds College of Music, England, is
lecturer in English Speaking)
this summer.
Latecomers will be asked to wait, in
the foyer until the completion of the
first song.
