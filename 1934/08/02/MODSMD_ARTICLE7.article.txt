# Titchener Will Discuss Rome
## 
### 
J. B. Titchener, acting associate pro
fessor of Classical Literature, will speak
in the dance studio of the Women's
Gymnasium tonight at 8 o'clock on
"The Use of Anecdote in Roman Bi
ography." The lecture is free to the
public.
Roman biographies, it is pointed out,
are filled with amusing illuminative ac
counts of people and their times. An
incident in a biography of Cato illus
trates the point. During his term of
office Cato removed from the senate one
Lucius Flaminius, an influential and
wealthy ex-consul. Flaminius, it seems,
had entertained a nameless lady at a
dinner party, and by way of saving her
from boredom had brought in and exe
cuted in her presence a condemned
criminal.
Professor Titchener graduated from
Clark College, Illinois, in 1917. He took
his master's degree in 1921 and his Ph.D.
in 1923. He became an instructor in
Greek at the University of Michigan,
and later an instructor and assistant
professor of Classical Languages at
Harvard. He next moved to Ohio State
University.
