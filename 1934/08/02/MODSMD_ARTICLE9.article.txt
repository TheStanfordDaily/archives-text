# Stanford Senior Disrobed In Role of Strikebreaker
## 
### 
One of Stanford's seagoing under
grads met the enemy in his first na
val encounter and they were not his.
Working on an oil tanker as a
strike-breaking seaman, William
(Bill) Bolton, senior, after going
ashore at Everett, Wash., was return
ing to the ship under full sail along a
lonely road, when a bevy of strikers
hove into sight off his starboard bow
and gave battle. Bolton cleared his
decks and squared away, preparing
to repel boarders, but was soon
stripped of his running gear. Guided
by the North Star and a sense of
modesty, he limped two miles into
port at half speed, looking very much
like Lady Godiva without her horse.
Accompanying Belton on his puni
tive expedition were Larry Cooke,
Stanford sophomoYe, and Oscar Lun
digren, U.C. senior, whose condition
after the battle could not be ascer
tained due to the difficulty of com
munication with the zone of battle.
It is assumed, however, from lack of
reports, that they did not have their
decks swept as clean as the good ship
"Belton." The young naval hero is
said to be contemplating a book en
titled "Two Hours Behind the Mask.
