# Stanford, Secretaries Mourn Passing of Aged Mail-Carrier
## 
### 
Old Mac, the mail carrier, was buried
last week.
Alan McCaskill had been working for
the University 16 years. Originally
hired on April 15, 1918, as a watchman,
Mac ended his career as the faithful
carrier of fetters from the post office to
the various offices in the Administra
tion building. He was 85 years old, and
seemed as staunch in his old age as
Germany's late von Hindenburg.
Mac is survived by a sister, Jean, liv
ing in San Francisco.
Led Bachelor Existence
Old Mac used to get $100 a month,
and he lived in a tiny room beneath
the art gallery. He paid no rent for his
quarters, and cooked his own meals.
The venerable Scotchman must have
saved a great deal of his money every
month, and a subject of speculation
among the many secretaries in the Uni
versity offices is, "I wonder how much
money Mac left—to his sister, of
course."
Mac was his own boss. On hot days
he'd never deliver a letter to the biology
building or any place equally that far
oIT his beat. He'd wait until he felt
like making the delivery.
Self-Elected Chapel Sexton
He appointed himself sexton of the
Chapel. He made himself the job of
handing out programs, and opening the
doors for visitors on Sundays. He felt
that the Chapel needed watching on
Sundays when so many tourists came
to see it; consequently, he was the

church's guardian. This self-made job
kept Mac busy on the Sabbath, so he
demanded Tuesday as his day off. The
University granted his wish.
Mac was born in Glasgow, and
traveled all over the world. He used to
speak of the Hawaiian Islands and Mex
ico with as great familiarity as that
with which he referred to his native
Scotland. He came to California in the
earliest pioneer days, and well remem
bered historic events of the nineteenth
century. v
In England, Mac worked foV Sir
Thomas Lipton before the famed Brit
ish sportsman became the world's tea
tycoon.
The most striking characteristic of
the old man was his broad background
of reading. He expounded his interna
tionalism doctrines to every interested
secretary in the Ad building.
I'opular with Secretaries
Mac was a great man with the ladies.
Every day he brought some little thing
to one of the secretaries. The girl at
the telephone switchboard has at her
desk a tiny feather that Mac brought
her. She has a small rock of granite
porphry that Mac thought was very
beautiful, and a piece from one of the
stained glass windows in the Chapel
which, he told her, was taken from the
earthquake wreckage in 1906. Mrs. Price
and Miss True still have some of the
brilliantly colored flowers Mac brought
them before ho died.

Mac is survived by a sister, Jean, liv
ing in San Francisco.
Led Bachelor Existence
Old Mac used to get $100 a month,
and he lived in a tiny room beneath
the art gallery. He paid no rent for his
quarters, and cooked his own meals.
The venerable Scotchman must have
saved a great deal of his money every
month, and a subject of speculation
among the many secretaries in the Uni
versity offices is, "I wonder how much
money Mac left—to his sister, of
course."
Mac was his own boss. On hot days
he'd never deliver a letter to the biology
building or any place equally that far
oIT his beat. He'd wait until he felt
like making the delivery.
Self-Elected Chapel Sexton
He appointed himself sexton of the
Chapel. He made himself the job of
handing out programs, and opening the
doors for visitors on Sundays. He felt
that the Chapel needed watching on
Sundays when so many tourists came
to see it; consequently, he was the

church's guardian. This self-made job
kept Mac busy on the Sabbath, so he
demanded Tuesday as his day off. The
University granted his wish.
Mac was born in Glasgow, and
traveled all over the world. He used to
speak of the Hawaiian Islands and Mex
ico with as great familiarity as that
with which he referred to his native
Scotland. He came to California in the
earliest pioneer days, and well remem
bered historic events of the nineteenth
century. v
In England, Mac worked foV Sir
Thomas Lipton before the famed Brit
ish sportsman became the world's tea
tycoon.
The most striking characteristic of
the old man was his broad background
of reading. He expounded his interna
tionalism doctrines to every interested
secretary in the Ad building.
I'opular with Secretaries
Mac was a great man with the ladies.
Every day he brought some little thing
to one of the secretaries. The girl at
the telephone switchboard has at her
desk a tiny feather that Mac brought
her. She has a small rock of granite
porphry that Mac thought was very
beautiful, and a piece from one of the
stained glass windows in the Chapel
which, he told her, was taken from the
earthquake wreckage in 1906. Mrs. Price
and Miss True still have some of the
brilliantly colored flowers Mac brought
them before ho died.
Old Mac died of old age.
Old Mac, the mail carrier, was buried
last week.
Alan McCaskill had been working for
the University 16 years. Originally
hired on April 15, 1918, as a watchman,
Mac ended his career as the faithful
carrier of fetters from the post office to
the various offices in the Administra
tion building. He was 85 years old, and
seemed as staunch in his old age as
Germany's late von Hindenburg.
