# Industry Is Lost If Private Funds Fail, Says Crum
## PWA, Temporary Prop, Must Be Backed by Citizens' Aid, According to Economist Capital Goods Industries Cited As Backbone of Nation 
### 
To charge that the proposed stimulus
to the capital goods industry can only
result in a worse depression is to un
derstate seriously the long-run needs
of a progressive economic society, Pro
fessor W. L. Crum told a KPO radio
audience at 8:30 o'clock last night. The
visiting Harvard economist has recently
completed a study of the effect of the
New Deal legislation on the capital
goods industries.
The well-known economist started
his talk by defining the two kinds of
capital goods—"goods that constitute
the physical equipment which pro
ducers use in making other goods or in
furnishing services," and "goods used
only once in productive operations."
He stated also ihat not all durable goods
are capital goods, and that not all capi
tal goods are durable.
Continuing, the professor said, "The
capital goods industries have a huge
capacity for increasing employment—
it is held by many expex-ts that the
most effective way to reduce unem
ployment is to stimulate these indus
tries. There can be no doubt that, to
get the biggest results for a given ex
penditure of public effort, we should
attempt to stimulate the capital goods
industries."
Recovery Affects Capital Goods
The distinguished economist, who
was formerly a professor in the Stan
ford School of Business Administra
tion, told how the recovery pi'ogram
touched the capital goods industries. He
explained that "the entire PWA pro
gram was almost certain to give a
healthy push to many capital goods in
dustries, but the actual stimulus to the
capital-goods industries has not thus
far been large."
According to Crum, many of the
NPiA codes, because of the increase in
labor costs, have stimulated the use of
more and better machinery, but many
restrictions against new machinery off
set this.
Constructive Criticism of New Deal
"Many constructive critics of the pro
gram have urged measures which would
release and encourage private invest
ment." This would stimulate employ
ment and revive the capital goods in
dustries, according to Professor Crum.
"Once private investment is restored
near normal the results will be more
substantial than those secured from
PWA activities," according to the visit
ing economist.
The professor concluded his radio
speech by explaining that it is a fallacy
to believe that the condition of having
too much productive machinery will
last long when business again returns
to normal. Therefore, "saving must bo
encouraged in order to induce and se
cure recovex-y."
W. Dalton Henderson, University
student, was the victim of a holdup last
Saturday night, when two armed men
entered the sex - vice station in Palo Alto,
where he is employed, ordered him to
lie on the floor, and robbed the cash
register of $16. The robbery occurx'ed
shortly after a similar holdup of an
other sex-vice station in the vicinity.

most effective way to reduce unem
ployment is to stimulate these indus
tries. There can be no doubt that, to
get the biggest results for a given ex
penditure of public effort, we should
attempt to stimulate the capital goods
industries."
Recovery Affects Capital Goods
The distinguished economist, who
was formerly a professor in the Stan
ford School of Business Administra
tion, told how the recovery pi'ogram
touched the capital goods industries. He
explained that "the entire PWA pro
gram was almost certain to give a
healthy push to many capital goods in
dustries, but the actual stimulus to the
capital-goods industries has not thus
far been large."
According to Crum, many of the
NPiA codes, because of the increase in
labor costs, have stimulated the use of
more and better machinery, but many
restrictions against new machinery off
set this.
Constructive Criticism of New Deal
"Many constructive critics of the pro
gram have urged measures which would
release and encourage private invest
ment." This would stimulate employ
ment and revive the capital goods in
dustries, according to Professor Crum.
"Once private investment is restored
near normal the results will be more
substantial than those secured from
PWA activities," according to the visit
ing economist.
The professor concluded his radio
speech by explaining that it is a fallacy
to believe that the condition of having
too much productive machinery will
last long when business again returns
to normal. Therefore, "saving must bo
encouraged in order to induce and se
cure recovex-y."
W. Dalton Henderson, University
student, was the victim of a holdup last
Saturday night, when two armed men
entered the sex - vice station in Palo Alto,
where he is employed, ordered him to
lie on the floor, and robbed the cash
register of $16. The robbery occurx'ed
shortly after a similar holdup of an
other sex-vice station in the vicinity.
To charge that the proposed stimulus
to the capital goods industry can only
result in a worse depression is to un
derstate seriously the long-run needs
of a progressive economic society, Pro
fessor W. L. Crum told a KPO radio
audience at 8:30 o'clock last night. The
visiting Harvard economist has recently
completed a study of the effect of the
New Deal legislation on the capital
goods industries.
The well-known economist started
his talk by defining the two kinds of
capital goods—"goods that constitute
the physical equipment which pro
ducers use in making other goods or in
furnishing services," and "goods used
only once in productive operations."
He stated also ihat not all durable goods
are capital goods, and that not all capi
tal goods are durable.
Continuing, the professor said, "The
capital goods industries have a huge
capacity for increasing employment—
it is held by many expex-ts that the
most effective way to reduce unem
ployment is to stimulate these indus
tries. There can be no doubt that, to
get the biggest results for a given ex
penditure of public effort, we should
attempt to stimulate the capital goods
