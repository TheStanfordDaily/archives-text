# Small But Excellent

I be Stanford summer quarter is one ot the finest in the country,
regardless of the small registration and the lack of campus activities that
are present during the regular academic year.
Although the undergraduate enrollment is small in comparison with
ihe graduate enrollment, there are many social and cultural activities to
offset the academic grind. The Pro Arte Concert series, dramatics,
dances, and programs sponsored by the Committee on Public Exercises
have done much to furnish relaxation and enjoyment for all students.
From the academic point of view, the University provides a full
length summer session, many competent visiting professors as well as
its regular staff; and the use of various facilities and conveniences neces
sary for study. The curriculum covers many fields, and is especially
favorable for those who wish to take advanced work.
Because of the excellent reputation that the Stanford summer school
enjoys, it is very probable that when the country becomes stabilized
(financially) the summer attendance will again reach capacity.â€”J.ll.G.
