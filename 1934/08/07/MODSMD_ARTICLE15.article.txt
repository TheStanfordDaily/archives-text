# Contagious Analogies

Recognizing a danger does not mean one has to cringe under it. nor
should it be painted with sensationalism and flagrantly broadcast through
out the world.
Sure, Dal fuss has been murdered. The consequences are serious and
might conceivably bring conflict between Italy and Germany, or between
Jugoslavia and Italy.
J1 itier is against the Catholic Church ruling in Austria under the
proposed return of the Hapsburgs. The Nazis probably murdered Dol
fnss to thwart Catholic domination and to further their cause at the
same time. Jugoslavia distrusts a Hapsburg prince ruling in Austria.
Such appears to be the set-up. It is by no means simple, but beyond
doubt it is clear. And there is no sane reason why sensationalism or
hysteria should spread a contagion in the mind of the world and distort
the situation, or make it appear worse than it really is.
Comparing the present situation to Sarajevo is sinster because the
outstanding feature of Sarajevo was uncontrolled passion, anger, and
headlong plunging into conflict. An emotional, unthinking world in 1914
rushed into war over a situation that need not have been more than a
passing incident, easily settled with justice and right thinking.
Despite all the laughs this will get —the world is actually more ma
ture in such consideration to day. Murder is bad. W'e feel sorry for
the widow and the Dolfuss children. I Jut as far as starting a war over
it—why ?
Punish the assassins, and let the world progress! —C.0.1!.
