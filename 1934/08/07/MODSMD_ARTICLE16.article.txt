In presenting the world premiere of "The Doctor's Wife.'' Director
Harold llelvenston not only produced a delightful satiric comedy, hut
created, for those who were fortunate enough to squirm into the bulging
auditorium last Friday night an evening of most enjoyable entertain
ment. Thanks to Mr. llelvenston and congratulations to Dr. Margery
Bailey and the other members of the cast for the professional manner
in which their roles were enacted.
The stage manager, too, deserves compliment for the arrangement
of the not-too-elaborate yet appropriate set. All together, it was an
amusing bit of comedv, wetl-plaved and deservingly well-received.
R.1T.8.
