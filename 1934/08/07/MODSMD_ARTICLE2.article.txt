### 
Jack Torrance's amazing performance :
with the shot came Sunday at Oslo,
Norway, with a heave of 57 feet 5-32 '
inches, at a time when Stanford ath- '
letes were obviously easing up under I
the comforts of European hospitality. \
So John Lyman's 280-pound rival from
Louisiana cannot be denied the spot- i
light; though Stanford trackman Ben 1
Eastman and John Lyman turned in
notable performances.
Lyman led the American athletes to ■
a sweeping victory against German |
competition Thursday, capturing the j
.«hot-put with 51 feet 8 inches, and the i
discus with 148 feet. Leading one of the
rare triumphs the American team has
scored on German soil, Lyman inspired I
the first real cleanup scored by either
team, the Germans suffering a defeat j
of 2 first places to 6.
Friday in Sweden Ben Eastman,
loafed to an easy victory in 1 minute!
57.8 seconds for 800 meters. At the i
same meet Bill Bonthron returned to
form with a world's record for three- ;
quarters of a mile. The time, 3 minutes |
8-10 seconds, broke Lovelock's official \
record by 1.4 seconds, and Gene Ven- ■
zke's unofficial record, made at Phila- j
delphia in May, by 1.2 seconds.
