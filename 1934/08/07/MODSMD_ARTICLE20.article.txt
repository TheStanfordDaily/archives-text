## DISPUTES EDITORIAL 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Your editorial in the edition of Au
gust 2 contains a post mortem reflection
on the educational changes at Brown
University which simplifies matters un
duly. True enough, in discontinuing
the degree of bachelor of philosophy
and in dropping Latin and Greek as an
entrance requirement, Brown Univer
sity has followed out certain principles
in contemporary education and psy
chology. The answer that Brown has
given is therefore quite logical. But
whether the principles on which this
answer is based are logical is quite a
different question. They may be and
they may not be. It all depends upon
the intrepretation of the concept of
"mental discipline." If we assume and
admit that the desirable mental dis
cipline may be acquired by a summa
tion of factual knowledge, conceiving
of the human mind as a chiefly and es
sentially passive receptacle, then it is
[ perfectly true that any time devoted to
classical studies is just so much time
and effort wasted. There still remains
the purely archaeological interest which
may motivate a few specialists to take
up these studies, but this- would not
constitute a valid reason for retaining
the classical languages as an entrance
requirement.
If, on the other hand, in spite of some
current trends in psychology, we are
not humble enough to give up our old
fashioned belief in the university as a
character - building institution rather
than an education factory, that a re
creative effort on the part of the stu
dent is not enough but that his creative
response' and his faculty of organizing
and visualizing his subject matter in
an original and novel way is required
—then it must be said that the humani
ties provide a specific mental training
or a specific outlook on life which can
perhaps not be measured in terms of
educational psychology, but which has
always been and w.fll always be the
basis and test of intellectual and social
leadership.
In spite of a certain contradictory
element in the second part of your edi
torial, I find contained- therein the
correct statement: "Philosophy . . . has
been sadly left behind." Why should
science be more exact than philosophy
which is based on human reason and
human experience, the same reasoning
process and the same type of experience
that science is based on? Not all phi
losophies are exact and scientific,
neither is all science, improperly so
called. The proofs of psychology may
be stringent but they may not even at
tempt to prove what we hold to be the
essential proof and test, i.e., the prem
ises and starting points may differ in
either case. It may well be that if the
writer of your editorial had been
trained in the humanities he would put
less trust in authorities and make bet
ter use of his innate common sense.
