# RESULTS OF CWA AID FOR STUDENTS TOLD
## Work Supplements College Education 
### 
All students in Stanford needing em
ployment were given an opportunity to
work on the CWA last spring quarter,
Mrs. Irene Spenner, executive assistant
of the appointment service, said yester
day.
Between March 1 and June 15, 318
jobs a month were open to students
needing employment to keep them in
college. They worked on every type of
project, even manual labor, but for the
most part the students were given as
sisting positions in their own major
departments. Among other things they
made re-agents in chemical laborato
ries, tested machinery and materials,
mounted specimens, and in sta
tistical work.
"Everyone employed on the CWA
needed work beyond doubt," Mrs.
Spenner stated. "All students who
needed tuition notes, cash grants, or
financial aid for self-support were
eligible."
This program developed extremely
valuable results. The co-operation with
departmental heads and professors
greatly increased the interest of the
students in their work, giving them re
newed ambition and inspiration for
their studies, according to Mrs. Spenner.
The various departments are now plac
ing a much higher value on the ability
and versatility of students. The re
newed confidence in both professors and
students created a closer harmony and
deepened understanding.
The plan also allowed for actual vo
cational training because it gave a prac
tical as well as theoretical knowledge
of the field chosen for life work, helping
many students to crystalize their ideas
and to know definitely what they
wanted to do in the future. The sys
tem of allotting the work provided a
means for broadening the student's
conception of education by acquainting
him with the work of other depart
ments as well as his own, as students
often aided with technical work in an
other department. The words "educa
tion" and "university" took on new
meanings in the light of their experi
ence, Mrs. Spenner added. â€¢
