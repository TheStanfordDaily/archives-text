# Prof. Blackwelder Leads Class Study in Yosemite
## 
### 
Seven geology students under the
leadership of Dr. Eliot Blackwelder un
dertook a field trip to Yosemite Valley
over the week-end. The group left the
campus at G o'clock on Friday morning
and returned at 9 o'clock Sunday night.
The main job of the trip was to locate
glaciated pebbles at which they were
unsuccessful.
The first day was spent investigating
geological points of interest along the
road to Yosemite. On the second day
Ihe party hiked into little Yosemite
Valley to look over that vicinity. On
Sunday they investigated the floor of
Yosemite Valley and returned to the
campus in the afternoon. While at
Yosemite the group stayed at Camp
Curry.

Harold Edelen, last year's basketball
captain of the Stanford varsity, has been
confined to the Palo Alto Hospital with
measles. He is not attending school but
was on the campus when he became ill.
The hospital reports that Edelen will
probably remain there for about 10
more days.
