# Roman Biographies Show Real Life, Says Titchener
## 
### 
According to Professor J. B. Titche
ner, acting associate professor of Clas
sical Literature, the recounting of sto
ries which were current in Roman days
is most illuminating in depicting the
life of those times.
In his talk Thursday in the dance
studio of the Women's Gymnasium,
Professor Titchener recounted several
amusing anecdotes from different Ro
man biographies, showing their sig
nificance in reconstructing the actual
Roman life of that time.
As an illustration, remarked Profes
sor Titchener, it is from these anecdotes
that it is known that Cato was per
sonally attacked in the courts 160 times
and on each occasion was vindicated.
At another time during his term of of
five, Cato removed from the senate one
Lucius Flaminius, an influential and
wealthy ex-consul. Flaminius, it seems,
had entertained a nameless lady at a
dinner party, and by way of saving her
from boredom had brought in an exe
cuted in her presence a condemned
criminal.
"The frequent use of anecdote," said
Professor Titchener, "made biographi
cal writing perhaps the most important
branch oi' Roman literature."
