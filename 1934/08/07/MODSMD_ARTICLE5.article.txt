# "Rivals" Reading Tomorrow Night In Little Theatre
## 
### 
William Gwinn has been cast as the
hot-tefripered Sir Lucius O'Trigger in
Sword and Sandals' reading of "The
Rivals" tomorrow night at 8 o'clock in
the Little Theatre. Gwinn appeared
last Friday as the doctor in "The Doc
tor's Wife." It is expected he will re
peat his success in Chauncey Olcott's
role of the irascible Irish baronet. His
previous experience has included "Dis
tant Drums" and readings of "Richard
II" and "S. S. Glencairn."
The roles of the young lovers, Lydia
Languish and Jack Absolute, will be
read by Florence Brill and James Mc-
Elney. Miss Brill, who in private life
is Mrs. Ralph Welles, wife of the di
rector of the Community Theatre, has
had experience as both playwright and
actress. Her one-act plays, "Home
Town" and "What Do They See in Each
Other?" have both been successfully
produced in Palo Alto. Her biggest
local success as an actress was in "Nine
'Till Six."
James McElney will read his first
straight role as the dashing Captain
Absolute. In the character part of Lipp
man, he contributed largely to the suc
cess of readings of "Of Thee I Sing"
and "Let 'Em Eat Cake." He has also
been seen locally in "An Enemy of the
People" and a reading of "The Play's
the Thing," besides taking part in Bur
lingame dramatics.
Hugh Baker, last seen as the gruff
Lord Porteous in "The Circle," will read
David, the country dolt. Wendell Keck,
instructor in English, will make his
campus dramatic debut as Fag, the city
cop.
Lucy, Miss Lydia's sly maid, will be
read by Mrs. William Kilby, who is
better known to campus audiences as
Harriette Hall. She played the flapper
in "Three Cornered Moon," as well as
reading in "Hay''Fever" and "Anatol."
As pi'eviously announced, Myna
Hughes and James Sandoe will l'ead
Mrs. Malaprop and Bob Acres, comedy
roles which have been made famous by
Mrs. Fiske and Joseph Jefferson.
Sheridan wrote "The Rivals" origi
nally for the sole purpose of making
money. He based his plot on inherently
funny situations and characters. Con
sequently, the play has remained fresh
and amusing for many years. The
script to be used tomorrow night has
been cut for the purpose of increasing
the tempo of ihe play and intensifying
the comedy. The public is invited.
