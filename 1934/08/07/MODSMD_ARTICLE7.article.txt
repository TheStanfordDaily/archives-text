### 
Announcement was made yesterday
by Marion Storey and Bob Grantier,
committee members, of a second jolly
up to be held next Monday from 7 to
8:30 o'clock.
Due to the fact that an unexpectedly
large crowd attended the last jolly-up,
the committee decided to hold the next
affair in the Women's Gym, which has
a larger space for dancing than the
Women's Clubhouse. Funds left over
from the first dance will be sufficient
to cover expenses and there will be no
admission charge.
Chaperoning the dance will be Pro
fessor E. G. Mears, Professor and Mrs.
R. H. Gabriel, and Miss Anastasia
Doyle. Grantier is arranging for an
orchestra.
