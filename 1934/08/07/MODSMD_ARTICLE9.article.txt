# "Doctor's Wife" Popular With Packed House
## Dr. Liston Revealed as True Author of Eric Linder's Medical Farce Shelley Smith, Doctor Bailey Praised for Acting 
### Philip Bernheim 
Now it can be told! The author of
"The Doctor's Wife," which was given
its premiere Friday night in the As
sembly Hall to a more than capacity
audience, is Dr. Edward Liston, a Palo
Alto physician, who wrote under the
nom de plume of Erie Linders.
An audience that filled every seat
and overflowed into the aisles and every
available inch of standing room greeted
Harold Helvenston's set with sponta
neous applause at the parting of the
first curtain. Then Margery Bailey en

thing but the play.
Dr. Bailey as Mrs. Harker* the doc

her daughter, gave the two outstanding
performances of the evening.
Dr. Bailey was almost ideally suited
to her role, although occasionally there

came in the love scene which she played
with Glenn Reed in scene four; but the
audience, which had been accustomed
to laughing throughout the play, unfor
tunately insisted upon taking the young
lovers lightly, and the two really didn't
have a chance to put the scene over.
William Gwinn made a very effective
Dr. Wilson. His portrayal of the bluff
and hearty medico had a natural and
sincere maturity which accurately met
the requirements of the role.
Glenn Reed, as young Dr. Wilson,
was adequate in a part which gave him
little opportunity to display any par
ticular acting ability.
O'Neill Inconsistent
The role of Wilson Everett, the neu
riotic and hypochondriac millionaire
benefactor of the Harkers, was played
by Frank O'Neill. O'Neill was too ob
viously acting and playing for comedy
effects. His characterization was not
consistent, as at times he made much
of "his physical ailments, while at other
times he seemed to forget that he was
