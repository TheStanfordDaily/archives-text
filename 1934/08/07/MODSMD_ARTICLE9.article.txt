# "Doctor's Wife" Popular With Packed House
## Dr. Liston Revealed as True Author of Eric Linder's Medical Farce Shelley Smith, Doctor Bailey Praised for Acting 
### Philip Bernheim 
Now it can be told! The author of
"The Doctor's Wife," which was given
its premiere Friday night in the As
sembly Hall to a more than capacity
audience, is Dr. Edward Liston, a Palo
Alto physician, who wrote under the
nom de plume of Erie Linders.
An audience that filled every seat
and overflowed into the aisles and every
available inch of standing room greeted
Harold Helvenston's set with sponta
neous applause at the parting of the
first curtain. Then Margery Bailey en
tered and the audience forgot every
thing but the play.
Dr. Bailey as Mrs. Harker* the doc
tor's wife, and Shelley Smith as Elaine,
her daughter, gave the two outstanding
performances of the evening.
Dr. Bailey was almost ideally suited
to her role, although occasionally there
was more of Dr. Bailey than of Mrs.
Harker in her portrayal. She some
times allowed too much of her own
personality to creep into her perform
ance, and it was not altogether consist
ent with the character of Mrs. Harker.
On the whole, however, hers was a
delightful performance, and the audi
ence applauded her as the hit of the
evening.
Miss Smith Pleasing
Shelley Smith was entirely natural as
the young daughter. In this play she
has added another excellent characteri
zation to her short dramatic career.
Her only opportunity for serious acting
came in the love scene which she played
with Glenn Reed in scene four; but the
audience, which had been accustomed
to laughing throughout the play, unfor
tunately insisted upon taking the young
lovers lightly, and the two really didn't
have a chance to put the scene over.
William Gwinn made a very effective
Dr. Wilson. His portrayal of the bluff
and hearty medico had a natural and
sincere maturity which accurately met
the requirements of the role.
Glenn Reed, as young Dr. Wilson,
was adequate in a part which gave him
little opportunity to display any par
ticular acting ability.
O'Neill Inconsistent
The role of Wilson Everett, the neu
riotic and hypochondriac millionaire
benefactor of the Harkers, was played
by Frank O'Neill. O'Neill was too ob
viously acting and playing for comedy
effects. His characterization was not
consistent, as at times he made much
of "his physical ailments, while at other
times he seemed to forget that he was
i anything but a healthy young collegian.
But at all times he was too obviously
' acting.
Marjorie Meyer filled the minor role
of Lena, the maid. Miss Meyer also
overplayed her part for comedy effects
: —overplayed it beyond the bounds of
credulity. The part would have been
funny had it been played "straight";
it needed no burlesquing.
Waldron Wilson, a campus youth,
had a very minor part as 13-year-old
Jimmy Harker.
Wife Long-Suffering
Situation, lather than plot, is the
basis of this comedy. Mrs. Harker is
| the long-suffering wife whose husband
j is always late for meals, whose tele
! phone is constantly ringing. She de
i scribes herself as nothing more than a
"domesticated telephone operator"—
who is firmly resolved that her hus
band shall retire and is equally deter
mined that her daughter .shall not
| marry a doctor.
Into the Harker home comes Wilson
| Everett, a former sweetheart of Mrs.
| Harker, with a number of chronic ail—
i ments and a large chart of his body on
| which to mark his "symptoms"; and
I young Dr. Wilson, who is Dr. Harker's
I new assistant. There follow Mrs. Har
j ker's attempts to get her husband to
! take a long-overdue vacation, climaxed
by the hilariously funny scene when
I Dr. Harker becomes "drunk" after a
secret dose of sodium amatol.
Needless to say, Elaine finally falls
in love with Dr. Wilson, destroying one
of her mother's cherished hopes, and
| Dr. Harker, through an unfortunate
| investment in a string of race horses,
| is forced to return to his practice, thus
I shattering the other.
The play is generously sprinkled with
j lines of sparkling humor, some of them
j just racy enough to be delightful. As
| I recall, however, it lacks good curtain
! lines in all but the first scene. The
script could profitably stand a great
deal of pruning, perhaps consolidation
into three scenes rather than the pres
ent four. The final scene, as presented,
failed to maintain either the pace or
suspense of the first three.
