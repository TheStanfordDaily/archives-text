Synopsis of Play
"El Ama de la Casa" marks the au
thor's first dramatic eulogy of Spanish
womanhoodâ€”the woman who is first
of all a mother, who is strong physically,
morally and socially, and who not only
equals her mate but even surpasses and
dominates him.
Dona Carlota marries Felix, a middle
aged widower and an inventor of note,
with three grown children. Their home,
even during the life of the first wife,
had been a hurly-burly of disorder,
and, since her death, worse than ever
under the administration of Tita Geno
veya, the hypocritical aunt.
The aunt and the two girls bitterly
resent Carlota's coming and they make
her life as miserable as possible. But
the new wife is equal to the occasion,
and, with affectionate firmness, tact,
and good sense, puts things to rights,
both in the house and in the hearts
of her stepchildren. She handles ad
mirably the delicate situation caused
by the son's fancied love for her and
sends him safely off to make a man of
himself.
Without other philosophic purpose
than to show that a real home cannot
exist without a genuine, whole-souled
woman to direct it, the play, with its
technical excellence and its sweet and
wholesome atmosphere, is one of the
author's soundest and most character
istic pieces of work.
