# Dr. von Klenze Lauds Nazi-ism
## Cites Comparative Peace in New Germany 
### 
Striking out at critics of the Nazi
regime in Germany, Dr. Camillo von
Klenze, visiting professor of Germanic
languages, yesterday declared he felt
the recent European crisis had amply
demonstrated the strength of the Nazi
movement.
He denied that any condition ap
proaching chaos exists in Germany to
day. As proof of the .peaceful methods
of Nazi-ism he pointed out that in 18
months of power under Der Fuehrer
only about 200 deaths of violence have
been reported, whereas thousands have
perished in the civil strife in Austria
this year.
He cited some of the achievements of
the Reichskanzler as follows: creation
of a unified state in place of the old
federal system, peace pacts on the east
ern frontier; great reduction in numer
ical unemployment; political unity in
stead of numerous political parties; a
program calling for external peace as
declared in the Tannenberg address;
and a large measure of future German
economic self-sufficiency.
The visiting professor predicts that
in the August 19 referendum in Ger
many, Nazi policies will be sustained,
and that results of the polls will re
veal a high index of solidarity behind
Hitler.
Much propaganda is now being dis
seminated at large, by certain anti-
Nazi interests, he avers. Oppression in
Germany of minority groups is now
an obsolete Nazi tenet, and frowned
upon by Der Fuehrer, he asserts.
Hitlerism in Dr. von Klenze's opin
ion, is the dike which holds back from
our Western civilization the rising
flood waters of Communism and chaos.
