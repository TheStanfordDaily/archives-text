### 
Dr. Harold K. Fabcr, professor of
pediatrics at the Stanford University
School of Medicine, who will talk on
"Poliomyelitis" to a KPO radio audience
Monday evening at 8:30 o'clock, has
written several important papers on
the disease. In collaboration with Pro
fessor Edwin W. Schultz, Stanford bac
teriologist, Dr. Fabcr has conducted sev
eral laboratory investigations with ref
erence to the germ which causes the
disease.
The layman's term, "infantile paraly
sis," is hardly accurate, Dr. Faber points
out, because the disease is not common
to infants. It attacks children more
often than adults, but does not often
affect a child during its first year of
life.
In the current epidemic the number
of severe cases has been much fewer
than formerly and a lower mortality
rate has beenfecorded. This shows, in
Dr. Faber's opinion, lhat the population
has acquired some degree of immunity
to the disease.
The first case of poliomyelitis was re
ported just !)'.) years ago this month.
