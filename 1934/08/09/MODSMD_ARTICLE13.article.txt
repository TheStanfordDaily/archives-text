Miss Locke is a friend of Edith Craig,
the daughter of Ellen Terry. V/hen in
England she was often Miss Craig's
guest at her home in Kent. It was
there and with her permission that
Miss Locke studied Ellen Terry's lec
ture notebooks on Shakespeare Plays
which are divided into three lectures,
"The Children," "Triumphant Women,"
and "Pathetic Women."
Dame Terry's notebooks are full of
directions to herself as to the inner
meaning of all her favorite roles. In
flection, gestures, and other details were
noted, and so closqly has Miss Locke
studied these manuscripts that she is
able to make Ellen Terry live again.
Miss Locke gives the lecture from mem
ory and in the costume of the period.
