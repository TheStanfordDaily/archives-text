# "The Last Roundup"
## 
### 
Much credit must be given to a umall group of students—the student
council—for arranging the informal get-togethers on the campus this
summer. Everyone has a good time at the Jolly-lips and a large crowd
is expected for the last Jolly-tip of the quarter to be held in the Women's
(iym next Monday night between 7 and 8:30.
Enough money was made on the last dance, so that the admission
for the final Jolly-tip is free. Come one, come all—it only lasts for an
hour and a half. Come early and enjoy yourself. Dive in fellas—it's
free! It is also hoped that some women will show up? . J. 11. CI.
