# Cigarettes in Dry Grass
## 
### 
It requires no thought to toss a burning cigarette or cigar butt from
the window of a car while driving along the highway. It doesn't take
much of a spark to ignite the dry grass, and a slight breeze is quite
capable of fanning a small blaze into a damaging fire. But it does take a
good-sized crew of men several hours, and sometimes days, to quell one
of these costly blazes once it starts sweeping across the dry and highly
inflammable countryside. The expense resulting from property damage
not infrequently runs into hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars.
