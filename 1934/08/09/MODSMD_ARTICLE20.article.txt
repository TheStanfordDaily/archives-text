# Myna Hughes, Sandoe Excellent in 'The Rivals'
## 
### 
Sword and Sandals has established a
reputation for excellence in its pro
duction which the performance of "The
Rivals" last night did more than up
hold.
From the usual well-balanced Sword
and Sandals cast it is hard to single out
any one person for approbation. Myna
Hughes in the role of Mrs. Malaprop
and Jimmy Sandoe as "Fighting Bob"
Acres carried off the laugh honors of
the evening.
Miss Hughes not only read her part
but acted it consummately. Her facial
expressions matched her words to per
fection. Here is real talent which cam
pus productions would do well to make
more use of.
Sandoe has the happy faculty of in
terpreting mouse-like men in a man
ner that convulses audiences. In the
role of Bob Acres he reminded one of
the mouse that inadvertently lapped up
whiskey from a leaking barrel, then
stood up, waved his paws wildly, and
cricd, "Bring on the cat!" But he was
equally uproarious in portraying what
must have been the mouse's feelings as
awful realization of what he had done
crept upon him when the effects of the

liquor wore off.
Hugh Baker is another campus actor
of merit. His particular talent is in
playing gruff, middle-aged men, which
he did to perfection in playing Sir An
thony Absolute.
Others in a uniformly good cast were
Florence Brill, Harriette Hall, James
McElney, William Gwinn, Wendell
Keck, and Robert Brauns. Walter New
comb read the stage directions.
