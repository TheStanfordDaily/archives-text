# HADDOCK PLEASES AT BALLAD RECITAL
## 
### 
Carrying his audience from mood to
mood, gay to sad, G. Marston Haddock,
visiting lecturer in music and principal
of the Leeds College of Music in Eng
land, sang a large selection of old folk
songs and ballads before an enthusiastic
audience Tuesday evening in the Wom
en's Gymnasium.
One of the oldest songs on the pro
gram was originally a Christmas carol,
written about 1460. New verses were
later substituted for the sacred lines
and it became a drinking song. An
other ballad, "O Thou Man," was taken
from an old manuscript found in West
minster Abbey. Professor Warren D.
Allen played the difficult accompani
ment on the piano.
Two special numbers, "Western Wind,
When Wilt Thou Blow?" and "Now
Ponder Well," were sung by Mr. Had
dock with accompaniment and setting
by Henry Co well, lccturer in music,
who featured these pieces with a bril
liantly individual technique.
