# WILL PALY TREE DIE? Dr. Clausen Believes Not Yet HAS CENTURY TO GO

Ls the famous Palo Alto tree on the
banks of San Francisquito Creek, at
the crossing of the Southern Pacific,
doomed to an early death? In the
expert opinion of Dr. J. Clausen, bot
anist of the Stanford branch of the Cer
negie Institute, it may survive for an
indefinite period, perhaps a century or
more.
"This specimen of redwood is known
as Sequoia sempervirens," said Dr.
Clausen, "and its true habitat is the
fog-belt. This particular Palo Alto tree
is therefore somewhat out of its range,
and its life will be determined by cli
matic changes."
The tree has always been a landmark.
It was first sighted by the Spaniards in
1769, and prior to that time was a
meeting place of the Indians. The fam
ous Pedro Font topographical map of
1776 shows the place where it stands.
It is probably 500 years or more old,
and the seed was no doubt washed down
from the Santa Cruz mountains. If the
tree lives for a century more, as Dr.
Clausen believes, Stanford will have this
living emblem of its seal surviving for
many generations to come.
