# CRUM SEES DEFLATION IN SECURITIES LAWS
## 
### 
The national securities measures of
1933 and 1934 are to be classed as "re
form" and in no sense "recovery" legis
lation, Professor W. L. Crum, visiting
professor of economics, told the Palo
Alto Kiwanis Club Wednesday.
The immediate effect of both the na
tional securities act of 1933 and securi
ties exchange act of 1934, he said, is to
retard recovery, because of the defla
tionary effect each measure has had.
The long-time result, he said, will Be
to afford greater protection to invest
ors, although despite the removal of the
major abuses that have developed in the
control of the investment field, the
investor can never be assured 100 per
cent protection. The element of risk,
the speaker said, will always be pres
ent, since the investor is obliged to
make a judgment on prospective value.
The act of 1933, according to Pro
lessor Crum, because of the complete
ness and accuracy of information it re
quires of directors of corporations, has
increased the possibility of litigation to
an extent that has naturally made pri
vate capital hesitant to embark on new
industrial activity.
This act, the speaker said, is one of
the three major obstacles to recovery.
The other two, he said, are "the non
sensical proposal to devaluate the dol
lar, and the equally nonsensical pro
posal to slop or postpone corporate
profits." Another effect of this act, the
speaker prophesied, will be a tendency
to place operating executives, rather
than mere advisory members, on boards
of directors.
The purpose of the national securi
ties exchange act, regulating the con
trol and operation of the stock market,
is highly desirable, Professor Crum said,.
He declared that "if we are to have
institutions that enable us to indulge
our natural gambling instincts they
should be free from our business struc
ture."
