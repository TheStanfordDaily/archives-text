# Improvement Shown by Kirk after Auto Mishap
## 
### 
William J. Kirk, lower division stu
dent who was run down by an auto
mobile in Menlo Park Tuesday after
noon, is reported to be "improving
rapidly." The summer quarter student
was hurt when he walked into the
path of 4111 automobile. He was taken
to the Palo Alto Hospital where he was
put on the operating table for treatment
for a badly lacerated arm and head.
Kirk, who is living at the Phi Gamma
Delta house, was walking across El
Camino Real near the Menlo Park post
office when he stepped in front of the
moving automobile. His arm was se
verely ripped when it became caught in
a door handle. The impact was so
violent that the handle was torn off.
Hugh Patterson, who is suffering
from a cold, is the only other student in
the hospital.
