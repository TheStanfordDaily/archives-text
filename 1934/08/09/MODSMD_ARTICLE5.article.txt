# Authors Write Of Library Uses
## Letters of Noted Writers on Display at Library 
### 
Leonard H. Kirkpatrick, of the Stan
ford University Libraries, sent out let
ters to several well-known authors ask
ing them how writers use a library.
The answers he received were varied
and interesting, and give a good ac
count of just how much authors use
libraries for their writing and why or
why not. They are on display in a case
on the second floor of the library.
Sinclair Lewis gave probably the
most interesting reasons why he didn't
use a library more than he does.
"I rarely use libraries for research,"
he replied, "for the simple reason that
so few of them permit one to lounge and
smoke, and generally be slovenly and
comfortable —without which condition
I rarely enjoy reading. Therefore, I
generally buy the books I need and
read them at home.
"The New Dartmouth Library has
large deep chairs, and one can smoke.
If more libraries had such pleasant
places, I would use them more than
I do."

Sherwood Anderson returned a very
satisfactory reply in which he said:
"My mind is not one of the sort that
goes in for research. I have always been
a great reader and consistently used
libraries wherever I go, and I daresay
I have been deeply influenced by my
reading, but my deepest interest has
always been in human beings. I spend
as much time as I can with human be
ings, and really think that this is my
library."
Thornton Wilder sent in a very en
lightening answer to the question. He
said: "I have neither the industry nor
the perseverance for research. Once
an imaginative narrative idea gets
started I plunge ahead guessing at de
tails of historical and local detail." He
gives the following example: " 'The
Bridge,' from this point of view, was
based almost entirely on a few notes at
the back of Prosper Merimee's short
story 'Carrosse du Saint Sacrement' in
the volume 'Le Theatre de Clara Gazul."
(The figure of the Marquese de Monte
mayor was drawn from that of Mmc.
de Sevigne, an old enthusiasm of mine.)
A few notes from Prescott found their
way in, too.
"The story of the Cardinal in 'The
Cabala' reflects some church-politics
color from Lytton Strachey's paper on
Cardinal Manning. The portrait of
Alix d'Espole owes something to a fig
ure in Saint-Simon's Memoires — a
niece of Madame de Maintenon, I even
forget her name now.
"Andros is an appalling misreading—
tones and facts—of Terence's play.
"People tell me that I seem to have
reconstructed the spirit and appearance
of 18th century Peru and late Greece,
but if you look carefully you will sec
a great economy in the use of visual
detail—so few notations that the read
er's imagination is forced to do the
rest: the reader under this necessity
builds up the background and then
compliments the author for the material
that isn't there at all."

John Dos Passos shows in his letter
that he reaps a great deal of profit from
the reading he does in libraries.
"Until I started on this series of three
narratives I am working on at present
I did no direct research for my books,"
he replied. "But for 'The 42nd Parallel'
and 'Nineteen Nineteen' I did a great
deal, some of it at the Chicago Public
Library (which is execrable) and at the
other endowed library in Chicago (the

Sinclair Lewis gave probably the
most interesting reasons why he didn't
use a library more than he does.
"I rarely use libraries for research,"
he replied, "for the simple reason that
so few of them permit one to lounge and
smoke, and generally be slovenly and
comfortable —without which condition
I rarely enjoy reading. Therefore, I
generally buy the books I need and
read them at home.
"The New Dartmouth Library has
large deep chairs, and one can smoke.
If more libraries had such pleasant
places, I would use them more than
I do."

Sherwood Anderson returned a very
satisfactory reply in which he said:
"My mind is not one of the sort that
goes in for research. I have always been
a great reader and consistently used
libraries wherever I go, and I daresay
I have been deeply influenced by my
reading, but my deepest interest has
always been in human beings. I spend
as much time as I can with human be
ings, and really think that this is my
library."
Thornton Wilder sent in a very en
lightening answer to the question. He
said: "I have neither the industry nor
the perseverance for research. Once
an imaginative narrative idea gets
started I plunge ahead guessing at de
tails of historical and local detail." He
gives the following example: " 'The
Bridge,' from this point of view, was
based almost entirely on a few notes at
the back of Prosper Merimee's short
story 'Carrosse du Saint Sacrement' in
the volume 'Le Theatre de Clara Gazul."
(The figure of the Marquese de Monte
mayor was drawn from that of Mmc.
de Sevigne, an old enthusiasm of mine.)
A few notes from Prescott found their
way in, too.
"The story of the Cardinal in 'The
Cabala' reflects some church-politics
color from Lytton Strachey's paper on
Cardinal Manning. The portrait of
Alix d'Espole owes something to a fig
ure in Saint-Simon's Memoires — a
niece of Madame de Maintenon, I even
forget her name now.
"Andros is an appalling misreading—
tones and facts—of Terence's play.
"People tell me that I seem to have
