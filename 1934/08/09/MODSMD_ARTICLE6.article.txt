# Final Summer Jolly-up to Be Monday Evenig
## Craigs Cardinals Will Play For Dance in Women's Gymnasium Affair Will Last From 7 to 8:30 p.m. 
### 
With one successful affair behind
them, the jolly-up committee, composed
of Marion Storey and Bob Grantier,
will again try to inject a little gaiety
into the dormant social life of the cam
pus when the second and last jolly-up
of the summer quarter gets under way
Monday night at 7 o'clock.
Craig's Cardinals have been engaged
to play for the dance and the commit
tee, in anticipation of a crowd that last
time packed the Women's Clubhouse,
has decided to use the Women's Gym
nasium, giving the stag lines more
room in which to crowd the dancers.
A timely donation from the Summer
Quarter Office, combined with funds
left over from the first dance, will pay
for the entire affair and there will be
no admission charge.
The Women's Council again prom
ises plenty of co-eds and it is believed
that the men will need no urging. The
committee wishes to stress the fact that
this will be the last social function of
the quarter and inasmuch as it is free,
expects a large turn-out.
Professor E. G. Mears, Miss Anasta
sia Doyle, and Dr. and Mrs. R. H.
Gabriel will chaperone the dance, which
will last until 8:30 o'clock.
