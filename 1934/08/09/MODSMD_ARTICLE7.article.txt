The delegates to the 12th annual
meeting of the Pacific Coast Building
Officials' Conference visited the campus
yesterday afternoon find evening. The
group is convening in Palo Alto this
week and under the leadership of L. H.
Anderson has planned several visits to
demonstrations on the campus.
This noon the visitors had lunch at
the Union followed by a tour of the
campus and the near vicinity. At 2
o'clock they attended a special demon
stration in the University Testing Labo
ratory for an hour. At 4 o'clock the
group motored out to the Harris J.
Ryan high tension laboratory to wit
ness the first public exhibition held
there in the past three years.
Professor J. S. Carroll, who has been
in charge of the laboratory since the
retirement of the late Professor Ryan
three years ago, gave a short talk fol
lowed by a demonstration with high
voltage arcs. In an off-hand unimpres
sive manner he caused a million-volt
arc to jump twelve feet from the end
of a heavy wire to the ceiling. The
crowd of some seventy-five engineers
was much impressed.
The group attended a theater party
last night at the Little Theatre. Tonight
they will hear a paper read by Profes
sor Bailey Willis on "Earthquake Causes
and Results" which will be followed by
a general discussion.
