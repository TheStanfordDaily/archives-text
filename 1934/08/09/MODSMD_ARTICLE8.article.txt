# Liquor Sales Case Will Be Tested Next Fall In Court
## 
### 
The state Supreme Court yesterday
granted a writ of review which will per
mit the trustees of Stanford University
to appeal from the ruling of the state
Board of Equalization in the Mayfield |
liquor sales case.
The court will review the board's de- I
cision next fall and determine whether
or not the section of the state penal code
which prohibits the sale of liquor within ;
one and one-half miles of a school has
reference to the border of Stanford s i
campus or the central buildings.
The petition brings up the question
of the legality of the liquor licenses j
issued by the State Board of Equaliza
tion to the California Avenue Pharmacy
at Mayfield. The board has until Octo
ber 14 to submit its briefs in the case
in support of its ruling that the mile- '
and-a-half restrictive zone should be |
measured from the administration
"buildings" instead of from the!
"grounds" as set forth in the penal
code. The university contends that the
board of equalization exceeded its au
thority in making invalid the penal code
ruling.
The legal steps taken by the univer
sity trustees are not intended to ques- j

lion the sale of 3.2 beer in Palo Alto
but will deal entirely with the selling
of "hard" liquors within the mile-and
a-half area.
In seeking permits from the board of
equalization to sell liquor at the Cali
fornia Avenue Pharmacy, Ralph Evans
and Stanley Bishop, proprietors, pointed
out that they were more than a milc
and-a-half from the administration of
fices on the campus by road measure
ment. On receiving licenses from the
state board the drug store displayed
liquor for sale and Bishop was arrested
for making a sale to a Palo Alto police
officer for the purpose of making a
"test case."
For the purpose of seeking a more
reasonable solution of the case, court
action brought by Evans and Bishop
for the purpose of restraining the po
lice department from interfering with
the liquor sale, was withdrawn with
the understanding that the city's protest
together with requests by Evans and
Bishop for permit renewals should be
sent to the board- of equalization for
action. Briefs at the board's meeting
in Sacramento were submitted by Stan
ford and Palo Alto legal counsel and
after a delay the board granted licenses,
ruling that the mile-and-a-half should
be measured from the university
"grounds."
Further attempts of the California
Avenue Pharmacy to display and sell
liquor, under its permits from the board
of equalization, have been prevented by
the Palo Alto police under advice of
City Attorney Arnold Rumwell.

The petition brings up the question
of the legality of the liquor licenses j
issued by the State Board of Equaliza
tion to the California Avenue Pharmacy
at Mayfield. The board has until Octo
ber 14 to submit its briefs in the case
in support of its ruling that the mile- '
and-a-half restrictive zone should be |
measured from the administration
"buildings" instead of from the!
"grounds" as set forth in the penal
code. The university contends that the
board of equalization exceeded its au
thority in making invalid the penal code
ruling.
The legal steps taken by the univer
sity trustees are not intended to ques- j

lion the sale of 3.2 beer in Palo Alto
but will deal entirely with the selling
of "hard" liquors within the mile-and
a-half area.
In seeking permits from the board of
equalization to sell liquor at the Cali
fornia Avenue Pharmacy, Ralph Evans
and Stanley Bishop, proprietors, pointed
out that they were more than a milc
and-a-half from the administration of
fices on the campus by road measure
ment. On receiving licenses from the
state board the drug store displayed
liquor for sale and Bishop was arrested
for making a sale to a Palo Alto police
officer for the purpose of making a
"test case."
For the purpose of seeking a more
reasonable solution of the case, court
action brought by Evans and Bishop
for the purpose of restraining the po
lice department from interfering with
the liquor sale, was withdrawn with
the understanding that the city's protest
together with requests by Evans and
Bishop for permit renewals should be
sent to the board- of equalization for
action. Briefs at the board's meeting
in Sacramento were submitted by Stan
ford and Palo Alto legal counsel and
after a delay the board granted licenses,
ruling that the mile-and-a-half should
be measured from the university
"grounds."
Further attempts of the California
Avenue Pharmacy to display and sell
liquor, under its permits from the board
of equalization, have been prevented by
the Palo Alto police under advice of
City Attorney Arnold Rumwell.

The state Supreme Court yesterday
granted a writ of review which will per
mit the trustees of Stanford University
to appeal from the ruling of the state
Board of Equalization in the Mayfield |

The court will review the board's de- I
cision next fall and determine whether
or not the section of the state penal code
which prohibits the sale of liquor within ;
one and one-half miles of a school has
reference to the border of Stanford s i
campus or the central buildings.
