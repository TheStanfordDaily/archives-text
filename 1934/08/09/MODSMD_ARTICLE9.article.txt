# Stanford School Of Education To Close August 18
## 
### 
The School of Education, awarding
23 master of arts and two doctor of
philosophy degrees this quarter, will
close August 18. In session for only
eight weeks because of the fact that
many administrators and teachers must
return to their schools this month, the
school nevertheless allows those who
can to continue for the remaining two
weeks, the opportunity of doing re
search and reading in their particular
fields.
At present a plan is being evolved
whereby those working for advanced
degrees next year will take three
quarters of work, completing three ten
hour courses besides their theses. These
courses, rather than being limited to
one instructor, will include talks by all
members of the faculty of the School
of Education, thus giving a complete
and organized body of knowledge to
the students.
The school this summer offered 43
courses. Enrollment of 17G greatly ex
ceeded that of last year, with a corre
sponding increase in the size of the
faculty.
