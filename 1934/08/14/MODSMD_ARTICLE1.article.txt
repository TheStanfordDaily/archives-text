### 
Miss Florence Locke, California act
ress who won high praise in England
last year with her Shakespearean recit
als, will play the roles of "Shakespeare's
Pathetic Women" at 8 o'clock tonight in
the dance studio of the Women's Gym
nasium. Miss Locke will present the
parts in the manner of Ellen Terry,
whom she has studied and whose tech
nique she has mastered.
Miss Locke is a friend of Miss Edith
Craig, daughter of the famous Ellen
Terry, and is performing with her per
mission. "When I first heard your ren
dering of the lecture I felt you had rare
qualifications for' the difficult task of
reproducing anything so individual as
my mother's observations on Shake
speare's characters," writes Miss Craig.
Illustrated Lectures
The recital-pageant of "Pathetic
Women" is what Ellen Terry called "the
courageous women who for good or ill
did battle against the tides and out
rages of circumstance." On this list are
Viola, Desdemona, Emilia, Juliet, Queen
Catherine, Cordelia, Imogen, Lady Mac
beth and Ophelia.
Miss Locke's performances were given
excellent reviews by the English crit
ics. "A magnificent exposition," writes
one. "She entertained the audience for
one hour, was word-perfect through
out, and gained her effects with beauti
fully modulated voice and grace of
gesture."
The lectures are illustrated with
scenes from Shakespeare, throwing into
relief his great women characters.
