What the forward-looking secondary
school is trying to do for its students
and, inferentially, for the social order
in the next generation will be told to
an NBC audience from station KPO next
Monday evening at 8:30 o'clock by Pro
fessor Harold Curtis Hand, of the
Stanford University School of Educa
tion.
One of the primary functions of Ihe
secondary school, in Dr. Hand's opin
ion, is to help the student to build inner
resources for a lifetime of self-directed,
socially desirable, and satisfying cre
ative activities. With the new leisure
that is coming, it is the aim of the
secondary school to develop in each
student at least one intellectual hobby,
one aesthetic hobby, one physical
hobby, and one handicraft, he says.
The program of the progressive sec
ondary school proceeds on Ihe assump
tion that normality for the individual
is the reward for meeting lifeâ€”the re
ward for living an active life, Dr. Hand
points out.
The secondary school also is trying
to make the student understand the
political realities of day in recog
nition of the imperatives imposed by
the new machine technology, and is
helping the student to evaluate the
various plans and "i.<;ms" that arc be
ing proposed as solutions for our social
ilLs, Dr. Hand explains.
Professor Hand, who studied at the
University of Minnesota and Columbia
University, was formerly connectcd
with the Teachers College of Columbia
University.
