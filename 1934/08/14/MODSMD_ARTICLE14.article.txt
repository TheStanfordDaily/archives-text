# Cathcart Probes "New Deal's " NRA In Law Address
## 
### 
Serious doubts on the constitutional
ity of NRA codes that go further than
the regulation of interstate commerce
were expressed by Arthur M. Cathcart,
professor of constitutional law at Stan
ford, in an address last week before
members of the University of Southern
California Law Alumni Association.
Professor Cathcart declared the Na
tional Idustrial Recovery Act "must be
justified, if at all, by the regulation of
the commerce clause in the Constitu
tion." He cited codes governing build
ing trades, service trades, barbers and
beauticians as examples of cases in
which no principle of interstate com
merce is involved.
"There is no constitutional basis for
the assumption that Congress has great
emergency power," declared Professor
Cathcart. "It is futile to attack the
Recovery Act as a whole on the
grounds that it is entirely unconstitu
tional. Each case must be tested in
the end as to whether that particular
case comes under the regulation of in
terstate commerce power."
