# Art Discussed By Reinhardt
## 
### 
'"Art, Literature, and a Thesis," and i
"Homer and the Pathetic Fallacy" were, j
respectively, the subjects of lectures last'
Thursday by Dr. Kurt F. Reinhardt of |
the department of Germanics and
Frank 0. Copley of the department of j
classical literature. The lectures and j
discussion which followed were held at :
a meeting of the University Philological
Association in the Women's Clubhouse, j
Mr. Copley, in his "Homer and the '
Pathetic Fallacy," disproved a conten
tion that Homer made no use whatso
ever of the pathetic fallacy. He illus- ,
trated several points where Homer did
apply in his writing human feeling to
inanimate objects (i.e., "cruel, crawling
foam"), but went on to state that the
idea was never fully developed.
Art Differs
Dr. Reinhardt, maintaining the doc
trine of Art for Art's Sake—with reser
vations, drew argument from several j
of his auditors, notably Dr. Camillo
von Klenze. Dr. Reinhardt pointed out
that there is an essential difference be- i
tween pure art, or Art for Art's Sake,
and art for the sake of propaganda— j
political, economical, theological, or !
otherwise. His argument in part is as j
follows:
"When the slogan Tart pour l'art' was ;
first coined about a century ago and l
when the doctrine was adopted and de
fended by Theophile Gautier in the
preface to his 'Poesies Completes,' the |
emphasis was placed upon the demand |
that the one and only end of a work
of art should be to strive for the realiza- ,
tion of the beautiful, and that this end
can hardly be attained when an artist
attempts to make his work tributary to 1
non-artistic purposes.
Poor Style Is Crime
"This statement was later affirmed i
but also enlarged and exaggerated by '
Emile Zola when he declared in the
collection of essays that bear the title,
'Le Roman Experimental' that to write ■
a poor style was the only crime that j
any writer or poet could possibly com
mit. Such exaggerations, however, are
not necessarily implied in the doctrine j
of Tart pour l'art,' and such conclu
sions arc not demanded by logic.
Rightly understood the doctrine of
Tart pour l'art' means nothing but the
affirmation of the significance of formal
beauty within its legitimate and par- .
ticulur sphere. In trying to define This |
particular sphere of art, then, we have
to fight against two fronts: on the one ,
hand, we have to turn against those who 1
claim that art is exclusively governed ,
by aesthetic laws and without relation
and under no responsibility to life, and
on the other hand against those who
consider art as a mere vehicle for the
spreading of political, social, or re
ligious ideas. . . . Both positions contain
an overstatement of fundamental truth.
. . . Without the content of actual and
vital experiences the work of art will
be void of life. . . . Without the quality \
of formal beauty the work will lack
artistic perfection."

"When the slogan Tart pour l'art' was ;
first coined about a century ago and l
when the doctrine was adopted and de
fended by Theophile Gautier in the
preface to his 'Poesies Completes,' the |
emphasis was placed upon the demand |
that the one and only end of a work
of art should be to strive for the realiza- ,
tion of the beautiful, and that this end
can hardly be attained when an artist
attempts to make his work tributary to 1
non-artistic purposes.
Poor Style Is Crime
"This statement was later affirmed i
but also enlarged and exaggerated by '
Emile Zola when he declared in the
collection of essays that bear the title,
'Le Roman Experimental' that to write ■
a poor style was the only crime that j
any writer or poet could possibly com
mit. Such exaggerations, however, are
not necessarily implied in the doctrine j
of Tart pour l'art,' and such conclu
sions arc not demanded by logic.
Rightly understood the doctrine of
Tart pour l'art' means nothing but the
affirmation of the significance of formal
beauty within its legitimate and par- .
ticulur sphere. In trying to define This |
particular sphere of art, then, we have
to fight against two fronts: on the one ,
hand, we have to turn against those who 1
claim that art is exclusively governed ,
by aesthetic laws and without relation
and under no responsibility to life, and
on the other hand against those who
consider art as a mere vehicle for the
spreading of political, social, or re
ligious ideas. . . . Both positions contain
an overstatement of fundamental truth.
. . . Without the content of actual and
vital experiences the work of art will
be void of life. . . . Without the quality \
of formal beauty the work will lack
artistic perfection."
'"Art, Literature, and a Thesis," and i
"Homer and the Pathetic Fallacy" were, j
respectively, the subjects of lectures last'
Thursday by Dr. Kurt F. Reinhardt of |
the department of Germanics and
Frank 0. Copley of the department of j
classical literature. The lectures and j
discussion which followed were held at :
a meeting of the University Philological
Association in the Women's Clubhouse, j
Mr. Copley, in his "Homer and the '
Pathetic Fallacy," disproved a conten
tion that Homer made no use whatso
ever of the pathetic fallacy. He illus- ,
trated several points where Homer did
apply in his writing human feeling to
inanimate objects (i.e., "cruel, crawling
foam"), but went on to state that the
idea was never fully developed.
Art Differs
Dr. Reinhardt, maintaining the doc
trine of Art for Art's Sake—with reser
vations, drew argument from several j
of his auditors, notably Dr. Camillo
von Klenze. Dr. Reinhardt pointed out
that there is an essential difference be- i
tween pure art, or Art for Art's Sake,
and art for the sake of propaganda— j
political, economical, theological, or !
otherwise. His argument in part is as j
follows:
