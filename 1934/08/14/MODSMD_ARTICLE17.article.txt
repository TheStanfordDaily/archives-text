# Faber Says Most Adults Immune To Poliomyelitis
## Pediatrics Professor Avers Rest Is Most Useful In Cure Most Cases Mild, Harmless, Says Radio Speaker 
### 
"It is rare to find more than one
case of paralysis in a single family and
the youngest child—if not a baby—is
apt to be the one affected," said Dr.
Harold K. Faber in his talk on Polio
myelitis, or infantile paralysis, over
KPO at 8:30 last night.
Dr. Faber, who is a professor of
pediatries at Stanford Medical School
in San Francisco, estimates that four
fifths of normal adults are immune to
the disease. The serum which is used
to combat poliomyelitis is taken from
10 or 20 such adults and mixed.
"Of all the measures that are useful
in poliomyelitis, the most essential is
rest," he said. "This simple but vital
measure prevents strain and added
damage to nerves and muscles threat
ened by the infection, and so prevents
mild cases from becoming severe ones."
Symptoms Similar to Flu
Poliomyelitis is a contagious infec
tion, being as a rule spread from one
person to another in the little droplets
expelled from the nose and mouth dur
ing coughing, sneezing, or even talk
ing. These droplets are caught in the
eyes, mouth, and particularly in the
nose. So long as they do not reach the
nerves of smell, they do no harm.
"Forcible in-breathing through the
nose or filling the nose with water may,
however, carry the germs to the dan
gerous areas and this is the reason for
advising against diving or swimming
with the head under water during the
periods of epidemic poliomyelitis," Dr.
Faber warned.
The symptoms of infantile paralysis
are similar to those of "flu" although
in some cases they are slightly dif
ferent.
Low Mortality Rale
"Without belittling the importance
and frequent seriousness of the disease,
it is fair to state that most cases are
mild and even beneficial, since they
leave the individual unharmed and
with a permanent resistance to future
and possibly more damaging attacks,"
the doctor reassured.
Of all the cases in this state this, year,
not more than 2 per cent have died, by
far the lowest mortality rate ever known
in any large epidemic.
