# The 						Scientific Attitude
## 
### 
One hears, every now or then and here or there, certain whisperings
that might he interpreted as somewhat derogatory to the integrity of The
Scientific Attitude. Certain ] parties have, after a period of observation
and exposure, arrived at a definite conclusion, and, having reached a
conclusion on the subject, signified they are no longer imbued with or
impressed by the said attitude. They have concluded, in short, that The
Scientific Attitude is not rill it's cracked up to be.
For the benefit of the unknowing, the attitude in question is. in a
word, an attitude that recognizes a definite basis of fact, a fact that
lias been subjected to all known tests and proven beyond reasonable
doubt, and which regards anything and everything above this base-line
as strictly hypthetical and of a largely problematical nature. It is best
exemplified by the various professors of the* scientific school who, upon
occasion, kindly remind their students that the priceless information they
have been absorbing is. after all, merely offered for their consideration
and is not to be regarded by them as possessing the elements of positive
truth.
The effect of this on many students, notably those in the courses in
Citizenship who have never come to grips with said attitude is, to say
the least, one of puzzlement. It is difficult for them to realize that they
have, in their previous experience and schooling, supposedly reached the
limit of fact and are now rising above it. It is hard for them to accept
a new method of reasoning, to find that they are, probably for the first
time, expected to think. 1»y far the larger part of the population, even
in college, fail to pass this stage.
It might be concluded, then, that the doubters had best confine their
efforts in the obtaining of their education to the schools of history,
languages, English, and the like, which admittedly have no truck with
scientific attitudes and other fetishes, and which confine their interests to
what is already known and not to what they hope to know next year or
in the next century. On the other hand, those who find themselves
reconciled to the idea of thinking, and who were never very good at
learning by rote anyway, may safely turn their steps in a scientific
direction; for if they have conquered The Scientific Attitude, they have
conquered the very means by which science has advanced the world
from the time the caveman discovered fire and wondered what to do
with it to the present day, the means by which .they will, probably,
continue to advance it.—A.
