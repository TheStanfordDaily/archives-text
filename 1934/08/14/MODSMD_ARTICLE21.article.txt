# Untermeyer and Klopstock
## 
### 
Samuel I'ntermeyer, as president of the Xonscetarian League to
Champion Human Rights# has made a plea to all Jewish-American
athletes in the L'nited States. I'ntermeyer wants the athletes to refuse
to compete at the 1936 Olympic Games in Merlin as a sort of athletic
boycott on German and international track fans because the athletes
will have to receive Nazi hospitality. And, evidently, supposes that the
conscience of the performing Jewish athletes will not rest easy in accept
ing the aforesaid hospitality.
The plea strikes close to home in that Stanford's own Samuel Klop
stock would he barred if he heeded the appeal. Klopstock probably is
the outstanding American athlete today who is affected by I ntermeyer's
suggestion.
I hit Klopstock himself is not of the Jewish faith, and neither is his
mother; however, his father is Jewish. Sam said yesterday that he
would compete at Merlin in 1936 if given half a chance, and that he
las no scruples whatsoever about the matter. Klopstock is not com
'pcting in Europe this summer and therefore not hurdling in Germany
because he refused an invitation to the track meet at Milwaukee last
month from which the touring American athletes are chosen. Sam said
that he turned down the Olympic Club's invitation to go East because
he believed that he needed a rest more than he needed further strenuous
and prolonged competition.
Aside from Klopstock's singular case these questions arise: Would
the glory and fame derived from a victory at Merlin offset the ob
viously unhospitable attitude that exists in Germany toward the
Jews? Is Samuel I ntermeyer's plea a sincere wish or is he
merely doing something that would be conspicuous by its absence if
it were not included in his program of Anti-Nazi-ism? Would the
average track fan at Merlin in 1936 discriminate between Jews and
Gentiles, and pray for the downfall of one and triumph for the other?
is the anti Jewish sentiment merely part of the Nazi regime, or does the
sentiment of a majority of the so-called "Aryans" fit into that form?
Wouldn't it be to the personal satisfaction of the Jewish athlete to
triumph in Merlin—the hotbed of sentiment against his race? G. C .
Democracy is the sum of the individual choices of its members.—
