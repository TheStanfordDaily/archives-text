# CWA FINDS COSTS FOR STUDENT LIVING AT WISCONSIN LOW
## Minimum Average of $348 Per Year Found In Campus Survey 
### 
Getting a university education for
less than $350 per year, including fees,
room, board, recreation, clothes, books,
and laundry, is the record achieved by
hundreds of Wisconsin students at the
University of Wisconsin, a CWA survey
of living costs on the State University
campus has just revealed.
The total bill for the past year re
ported by the students who lived the
most economically averaged $348.78 for
the 252 days of the University term.
This figure, according to the survey,
represents the average minimum ex
pense for a whole year of study at the
University, and was accomplished by
students living together in small groups,
and either cooking their own meals or
eating in dining rooms of the State Uni
versity.
Average Cost Low
The average cost of attending the
State University for a year ranged from
the low average minimum of $348.78
to a high average of $447.70, the figures
showed.
The figures were obtained by inter
viewing more than 700 students of vary
ing economic circumstances and living
in all types of student houses. It is
the first time that actual expenses have
been listed by the students themselves
and the results are lower than pre
vious official University estimates of
the average cost of a year at the State
University.
The CWA investigators found the
average student's expenses for the year,
excepting clothes and recreation which
depend on the individual student, to be
made up of the following items:
Board $205.92
Room 119.52
Books and Supplies 3526
All fees 77.00
Laundry if Sent Home 10.00
Total $447.70
Some students, especially those living
in private dormitories, fraternities and
sororities, spent more than the average,
but this fact means that many others
spent less than the average. Room and
board in the University dormitories was
a few dollars under the average.
U. W. Cuts Recreatioji Costs
The men spent less than half as
much as the women for clothes but
lived up to the chivalric tradition of
paying for their ■ partners on social oc
casions, spending almost twice as much
as the women for recreation.
Recreation expenses of the students
have been reduced by the efforts of
the University. The survey estimates
that this expense would have been
more than a dollar per week higher for
each student had not the University
provided concerts, dances, games, books,
newspapers, art exhibitions, and moving
pictures without expense to students in
the campus social and recreational cen
ter, the Memorial Union. The dining
rooms of the Union also saved regular
student customers $1.17 a week under
the average board cost for all students.
Costs Home Folks Little
Not all of the student's money came
from home, the CWA report shows.
The average student received only, from
$200 to $400 for the whole year from
home, which he spent entirely for room,
board, and recreation. The i*est he got as
special gifts or loans, or earned during
the summer or at school. 1
Altogether, 43.6 per cent of the stu
dent body earned all or part of their
University expenses last year. Almost
25 per cent worked for their board
and 2.8 per cent earned their room.
In addition, 18.9 per cent earned an
average of $5.57 a week in cash.

University, and was accomplished by
students living together in small groups,
and either cooking their own meals or
eating in dining rooms of the State Uni
versity.
Average Cost Low
The average cost of attending the
State University for a year ranged from
the low average minimum of $348.78
to a high average of $447.70, the figures
showed.
The figures were obtained by inter
viewing more than 700 students of vary
ing economic circumstances and living
in all types of student houses. It is
the first time that actual expenses have
been listed by the students themselves
and the results are lower than pre
vious official University estimates of
the average cost of a year at the State
University.
The CWA investigators found the
average student's expenses for the year,
excepting clothes and recreation which
depend on the individual student, to be
made up of the following items:
Board $205.92
Room 119.52
Books and Supplies 3526
All fees 77.00
Laundry if Sent Home 10.00
Total $447.70
Some students, especially those living
in private dormitories, fraternities and
sororities, spent more than the average,
but this fact means that many others
spent less than the average. Room and
board in the University dormitories was
a few dollars under the average.
U. W. Cuts Recreatioji Costs
The men spent less than half as
much as the women for clothes but
lived up to the chivalric tradition of
paying for their ■ partners on social oc
casions, spending almost twice as much
as the women for recreation.
Recreation expenses of the students
have been reduced by the efforts of
the University. The survey estimates
that this expense would have been
more than a dollar per week higher for
each student had not the University
provided concerts, dances, games, books,
newspapers, art exhibitions, and moving
pictures without expense to students in
the campus social and recreational cen
ter, the Memorial Union. The dining
rooms of the Union also saved regular
student customers $1.17 a week under
the average board cost for all students.
Costs Home Folks Little
Not all of the student's money came
from home, the CWA report shows.
The average student received only, from
$200 to $400 for the whole year from
home, which he spent entirely for room,
board, and recreation. The i*est he got as
special gifts or loans, or earned during
the summer or at school. 1
Altogether, 43.6 per cent of the stu
dent body earned all or part of their
University expenses last year. Almost
25 per cent worked for their board
and 2.8 per cent earned their room.
In addition, 18.9 per cent earned an
average of $5.57 a week in cash.
Getting a university education for
less than $350 per year, including fees,
room, board, recreation, clothes, books,
and laundry, is the record achieved by
hundreds of Wisconsin students at the
University of Wisconsin, a CWA survey
of living costs on the State University
campus has just revealed.
The total bill for the past year re
ported by the students who lived the
most economically averaged $348.78 for
the 252 days of the University term.
This figure, according to the survey,
represents the average minimum ex
pense for a whole year of study at the
University, and was accomplished by
students living together in small groups,
and either cooking their own meals or
eating in dining rooms of the State Uni
