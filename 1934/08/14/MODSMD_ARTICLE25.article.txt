# KISER. PURDUE COACH. WINS FOOTBALL VOTE
## 
### 
The results of the poll closed Friday
by the Chicago Tribune placed Noble
KiEcr of Purdue as coach of the 1933
collegiate team to meet the Chicago
Bears, according to G1.7,000 voters.
In the final drive the Purdue mentor
outdistanced Bob Zuppke of Illinois
and Dick Hanley of Northwestern by
over 12,000 points.
First, second, and third choices were
registered by eacH voter and the re
sults found Ernie Nevers, Stanford as
sistant coach, in eleventh place, the
second Pacific Coast coach to rate.
On the other hand, Tiny Thornhill,
Stanford's head coach did not rate
among the first thirty, a fact which has
been explained because voting centered
in the Mid-West. No Pacific Coast
coach rated very high; "Slip" Madigan
of St. Mary's being Ihe exception. He
gathered 58,451 first choice votes which,
together with numerous second and
third choices, landed him in fifth place.
Nevers, evidently remembered by
Mid-Westerners for his widely heralded
ability at playing and coaching, gath
ered 103,986 points, including 17,290 first
choice votes, as compared with 241,980
points and 58,451 first choices for Madi
gan.
