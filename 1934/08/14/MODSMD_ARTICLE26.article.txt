# EASTMAN AND LYMAN COMPETE IN EUROPE
## 
### 
American track and field forces which
were touring Europe in two sections
combined Sunday and descended on
Amsterdam to capture a lion's share of
the honors in international competition
against English, Dutch, Swedish, Aus
tralian, and other stars. Ben Eastman
and John Lyman, Stanford aces, fig
ured prominently in the impressive
American showing.
Most startling was Jack Lovelock's
easy triumph over Bill Bonthron. Run
ning on a water 7 soaked track, Love
lock won the 1500 meter run from
Princeton's pride in the slow time of
3 minutes 53 seconds.
Ben Eastman continued his consist
ent performances with a victory at
800 meters in 1 minute 53.3 seconds.
This compared favorably with his time
of 1 minute 52.1 seconds for the same
distance on a fast track a Malmo,
Sweden, Thursday.
Lyman took second to Torrance's 53
foot 3 inch toss of the shot. The Stan
ford boy was off form and could do no
better than 48 feet 5 inches.
