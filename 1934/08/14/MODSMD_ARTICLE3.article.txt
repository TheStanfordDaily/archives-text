# Lawson Little Takes Title In Northern Calif. Open
## 
### 
Lawson Little, Stanford student who
won the British amateur championship
this year, added another golfing laurel
to his accomplishments by winning the
Northern California open championship
last Sunday.
Averaging par 72 for his 72 holes of
super golf, Little nosed out Benny
Coltrin, the dapper young professional
from Lake Merced, by four strokes.
Little finished with a total of 288 and
Coltrin with 292 after the four grueling
rounds were completed.
The Stanford student scored a par
smashing GG on his first 18 holes, which
ultimately gave him his edge of victory.
