# REV. PATTEN PREACHES

### 
"Religion, more than almost anything
else, makes life good because it con
secrates the pleasures of life and brings
to the adverse side of it a blessed power
of transformation," said the Rev. Carl S.
Patten in his sermon on "What Makes
Life Good" in the Memorial Church last
Sunday.
The Rev. Patten was formerly at the
First Congregational Church in Los
Ahgeles and is now at the Pacific School
of Religion in Berkeley,
