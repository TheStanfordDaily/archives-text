# THESE ARE TOURIST DAYS All Ask Same Question SAY, CAN YOU TELL ME
## 
### 
There are the bright-eyed touring
Republicans from Podunk, with furni
ture and crated pets strapped all over
their cars, who always ask how to get
to the Hoover home as if they just
wanted to drop in and say "Hello" to
Herb.
There are the sad-eyed elderly ladies
with their bored elderly spouses who
sobbingly inquire just how they may
get to the Lamson home.
There are the camera-carrying,
tweed-clad sort who ask what there is
of interest that they can see in 45
minutes.
And there are always the unfortu
nate who urgently, blushingly, say
"Pardon me, but where is the uh, ah,
er." And you tell them to the left as
you enter the Union Cellar.
