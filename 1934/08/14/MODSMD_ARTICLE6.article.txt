# Spanish Drama In Union Patio
## 
### 
The Spanish Drama class will pre
sent their summer play, "El Ama de la
Casa," tomorrow night at 8 o'clock in
the patio of the Union. The perform
ance is free to the public.
Of particular interest is the new cam
pus talent being brought to light. The
two spoiled girls. Rosebud Moore and
Mae Ramelli, are doing their bits against
the star, Frances Slanina. Quirina Rael
is taking the part of the aunt, who is an
important character.
Richard Dickenson, the business man,
and Fred Pearman, the suitor, play
parts that those not particularly well
versed in the language will be able to
understand. John Reid, in the role of
the father, has plenty of trouble with
his family. Mr. Reid, an instructor in
the Romanic Languages Department, is
directing the play. The young male
lead, Ramon Espinosa, is imported as
showing much talent although new to
the footlights.
