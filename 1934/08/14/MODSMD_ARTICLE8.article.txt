# Bernthal Convalescent From Paralysis Attack
## 
### 
Herbert Bernthal, former Stanford
student, is on the road back to health,
having overcome an infantile paralysis
attack with remarkable courage. The
former student, who is a member of
the Kappa Sigma fraternity, spent 70
days in a respirator, but he is now able
to use his own lungs.
Bernthal, who was attacked suddenly
by the sickness while working in a San
Francisco bank, has already recovered
the use of his arms which were para
lyzed. He is not able to use his body
from the hips down :.s yet, but the doc
tors are holding little fear that he will
be permanently paralyzed. They be
lieve that the courage that pulled him
through 10 weeks in the respirator will
aid him in a speedy recovery.
