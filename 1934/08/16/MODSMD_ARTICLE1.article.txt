# Gabriel Tells Why We Like Individualism
## Yale Historian Traces Roots Of American Acceptance Of Doctrine Wage-Earning Classes Here Look To Top 
### 
Visiting Professor Ralph H. Gabriel
explained in an interview yesterday
how it came about that Americans have
accepted the doctrines of John Stuart
Mill, Herbert Spencer, and W. G. Sum
ner—the prophets of individualism.
Dr. Gabriel, professor of history at
Yale, is well known as an author, hav
ing written several books, including
"The Lure of the Frontier," "In De
fense of Liberty," "Toilei's on Land and
Sea," "The Winning of Freedom," and
"An Outline of United States History."
"In the early and middle decades of
the nineteenth century," said Dr. Ga
briel, "the Americans were spreading a
thin veneer of settlers over the vast
area west -of the Appalachians. Be
cause of the richness of the environ
ment and the low density of population
a large measure of security existed for
the average individual.
Exploitation Was Individualistic
"In this region the individual entre
preneur was the characteristic figure.
He lived in a system of free competi
tion among individuals, a system well
adapted.to the task of rapidly pushing
the frontier west. In these decades many
collectivist experiments were tried in
the communistic communities of the
day, most of which, however, came to
naught.
"When the great mineral wealth of
America was made available in the
middle years of the century by the
advance of scientific knowledge and the
development of the railroad, Ameri
cans tended to follow the same system
of individualistic exploitation they had
used in appropriating the soil. The
result was the industrial giant of the
days of Sumner."
Because these men had profited by the
system of laissez-faire and free com
petition, Professor Gabriel pointed out,
they clung to it. The majority of
Americans—at the end of the century,
exclusive of the newly arrived immi
grants—accepted the same ideas partly
from tradition, but also because of the
absence in America of a fixed social
stratification of the type that had long
prevailed in Europe. America had no
aristocracy.
Wage Class Looked Upward
"In Sumner's day," continued Dr.
Gabriel, "when new industries were ap
pearing and old ones were expanding,
there were many illustrations of men
rising from poverty to wealth and posi
tions of influence. Class consciousness
in the European sense did not develop
rapidly. This fact, together with the
rapid rise in material wealth under a
system built in general on lines advo
cated by Spencer and Sumner, en
hanced the prestige of that system.
'There was opportunity for able
wage-earners to become capitalists.
The wage-earning group as a whole—
unlike that of England—was long
balked in its effort to achieve group
consciousness by a confusion of lan
guages and by transplanted national
animosities."

No human voice can come close to
imitating the song of birds, according
to scientists.
