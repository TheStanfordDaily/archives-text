### 
The Union Cellar will elose its doors

Union lobby) will serve breakfast from
7:50 to 9:00 o'clock. It will be kept

The main dining room will be open

Alterations Began June 20
Alterations and enlargement of the
Cellar started June 26 following ap
proval by the Union Board of Gover
nors of plans calling for an expenditure
of $25,000. The main feature of the new
Cellar will be the large sun-room at the
north end of the building which will be
fitted with booths to take care of G4
additional diners, thus making pos
sible quicker accommodation for the
crowd at rush periods. The kitchen
space is being extended to make more
room at the supply end.
This marks the third stage in the de
velopment of the Cellar. Only old
timers will remember the first stage,
nothing much more than a hole in the
wall, truly a "cellar." A few of the
present generation, so to speak, will re
member its expansion to its present
form some five years or so ago, when
the present lower level was completed
and fitted. The incoming generation
this autumn will find a new Cellar,
little guessing of the gradual develop
ment which brought it from a cellar in
fact to a cellar in name.
