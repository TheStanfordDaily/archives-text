Mankind has always had a tendency to persecute. The Egyptians
and Babylonians persecuted the Jews. The Romans persecuted the
Christians. Early Americans persecuted supposed witches. And pres
ent-day Americans persecute the Communists.
Movements of any kind thrive on martyrdom. Vigilante activities
against the Reds delight them, for it gives them the change to pose as
maltreated representatives of the working classes.
Furthermore, it should hardly he necessary to point out that such
vigilante activities are as un-American as the practices it is desired to
suppress. And two wrongs do not make a right.
But far more important than the stamping out of Communist agi
tators is the elimination of those conditions which foster Communistic
beliefs. If there is a radical menace in the United States today, it is
here because it has found something to feed upon. It is useless to stamp
out agitators unless we also stamp out the conditions which foster them.
To the Red-baiting American Legion, now convened in San Fran
cisco, we suggest, first, that the determining of the social and economic
maladjustments which make embittered men easy prey of the prophets
of revolution and dupes of unsound I'topian schemes, and second, the
correction of these fundamental causes of radicalism are tasks far more
worthy of the Legion's effort's than are its present silly tirades. Thus can
the Legion be of true service to America P. B.
