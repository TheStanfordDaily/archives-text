# Au Revoir, Educators
## 
### 
The crowds of educators who arc now giving the libraries the heaviest
ru<n they have experienced this summer will make the campus seem
even more deserted next week as the hulk of them leave for their re
spective schools, the eight-week period ending with finals for most of
them this week.
Constituting the hulk of our summer registration, these students have
taken the campus into their own hands during their stay. Starting with
the Curriculum Conference in the last week of June, a succession of
activities for the education group followed. Weekly lunchcans, lectures
for the department and the public, a dance (as well as an obvious domi
nance at the jolly-lips), picnics, and the functions of their fraternal
organizations, have been some of the things that have supplemented the
routine Stanford summer life for the teachers.
That this group made the summer quarter possible will be evidenced
by the lonely corridors and relatively deserted Union for the remaining
two weeks. J). L. M.
