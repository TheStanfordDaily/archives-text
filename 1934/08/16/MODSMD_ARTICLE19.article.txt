# Inflation Danger Remote
## 
### 
It is estimated from reliable sources that at the close of the 1935
fiscal year the government debt will have increased approximately six
billion dollars to a grand total of more than thirty billion dollars.
Such a deficit is unprecedented in this nation, and its size is bound to
create all manner of schemes for its final reduction. At present, some
individuals arc fearful that a further increase in the debt structure will
bring as an inevitable consequence a resort to inflation.
Such a possibility seems at best to be remote. Inflation, because of
its utter and complete condemnation by practically every worthwhile
economist, has few adherents whose opinions bear weight in govern
ment circles.
Indeed, the spectre of currency inflation is now so horrible that our
sober minded citizens shiver at the mention of its name, knowing its
consequences from the indelible lessons of history to be nearj; \s harm
ful as war. So firmly rooted is this conviction in the niincw of most
\mcricans, so dread are the perils of currency inflation, so strong is
every logical argument set against it that it appears, even though the
government debt should be doubled, America would sacrifice every
thing before accepting the aid of a system which might mean complete
destruction. i J. W. 11.
