# The 						Epic Plan Elsewhere
## 
### 
Upton Sinclair may not be California's next governor and may not
even receive the Democratic nomination, yet the much-discussed Epic
plan will have already been tested, in some of its phases, in other parts
of the country.
Dayton, Ohio, has its Association of Co-operative Industries spon
soring self-help units, wherein a group of individuals produce a number
of their own necessities, including basic foodstuffs and clothing, bar
tering is used as the means oT distribution. Similar co-operatives are
operating in the three .Michigan cities of Detroit, Kalamazoo and
Lansing.
Existence over a period of time proves the success of these self
sufficing ventures and is economically .significant insofar as the smaller
units are concerned. I Hit whether these would lie successful if applied
on a state-wide scale, as proposed in the Epic plan, is something that
cannot he determined except bv experimentation.
Such a scheme may or may not conform with otoc's ideas as to the
best possible way of eradicating poverty from the state, but cognizance
must be taken of the possibility of the adoption of such a plan, should
the voters so ordain at the coming primary and state elections. K. 11.15.
