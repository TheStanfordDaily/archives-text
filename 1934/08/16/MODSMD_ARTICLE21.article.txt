# SPANISH DANCING AND MUSIC ARE ENJOYED
## 
### 
In a setting reminiscent of old Cas
tile, Rosebud Moore opened "El Ama de
la Casa" with a Spanish dance to the
music of a Mexican string trio as the
annual Spanish play was pVcsented in
the Union Patio last night.
Written by Martinez Sierra, "El Ama
de la Casa" is a dramatic eulogy of
Spanish womanhood, and since it was
done entirely in Spanish it could be
appreciated fully only by a restricted
audience.
Frances Slanina as Carlota, the moth
er, ruled a hurly-burly household in
which Mrs. Juan B. Rael as Tita Ge
noveva, the aunt, Mae Ramelli and
Rosebud Moore, as Gloria and Laura,
daughters, bitterly resented her pres
ence, inasmuch as she was the second
wife of Don Felix, the father, played by
John Reid. Taking the situation firmly
but gently in hand, Carlota overcomes
every obstacle, even to tactfully avoid
ing the fancied love oÂ£ the son, Rieardo,
played by Ramon Espinosa, and sending
him off to make a man of himself. Fred
Pearman and Richard Dickenson as
Pepe and Patricio, respectively, played
minor supporting parts.
Portraying a difficult part that called
for finished acting, Frances Slanina
kept well up to the standard she has set
for herself in the many plays she has
participated in before. John Reid, who
directed the play as well as taking a
title role, is well known in dramatic
circles and gave an excellent perform
ance. Mrs. Juan B. Rael did convinc
ing work as the hypocritical aunt and
was well supported by two newcomers
to the stage, Rosebud Moore and Mae
Ramelli, playing the part of a coquet
and a spoiled daughter. The minor
roles were as well handled as could be
expected, with the actors overcoming
an unfamiliarity with the language. Ra
mon Espinosa, however, with an ex
cellent command of Spanish, did his
part well.
