# REPORT TELLS OF POSSIBLE REDUCTION IN WHEAT SURPLUS
## Food Research Institute Holds Reduction Will Stimulate Price Recovery 
### 
World wheat .stocks may possibly but
not probably be reduced to normal by
August 1, 1935. This is the opinion of
the Stanford experts in the Food Re
search Institute, as expressed in a re
cent series of wheat studies entitled,
"Decline and Recovery of Wheat Prices
in the Nineties," compiled by Helen C.
Farnsworth.
If the world wheat surplus were
brought to normal, an important and
essential step toward recovery of wheat
prices would be taken, say the investi
gators. However, it does not now seem
likely, although it is conceivable, that
such an adjustment will occur by Au
gust, 1935.
Surplus wheat carryovers of 1933 and
1934 appear roughly twice as large, in
relation to ordinary world wheat con
sumption, as the maximum surplus car
ryover of the 'nineties. It seems unlike
ly that either decreased production or
increased consumption can be effected
to bring about a reduction in surplus
to achieve a normal condition in a
year's time.
Nature Helped in 'Nineties
Hope for such readjustment lies in
contraction of production by natural,
economic or political means, for there
seems little chance of a greatly in
creased consumption, the report says.
Nature seems willing to piay her part
in solving the problem since the pres
ent outlook for the world wheat crop
in 1934 is substantially smaller than in
1933. It does not appear probable, how
ever, that such a curtailment of pro
duction will be sufficiently large to
bring about the needed reduction.
In the critical situation of the "nine
ties, however, nature achieved the cure
almost unaided by economic or political
measures, the report points out. Then,
as now, the world price was low largely
Ijecause of a continued surplus. Re
covery of prices rested mainly upon re
duction of world year-end wheat stocks
to about a normal level by August,
1897, with prospects of a short world
crop in that year.
Other Factors Important
However, according to the report, full
elimination of the surplus, although
essential, is not the only factor to bring
Ihe price nearer normal. A combina
tion of circumstances, such as short
crops , a more active European demand,
and improvement in European financial
conditions, might start world wheat
prices upward; the rising prices might
induce relaxation of import restrictions
in Europe; and consumption would be
encouraged.
Of course, such a rise would not con
stitute full recovery of world wheat
prices, nor would it indicate that the
carryover surplus had been eliminated,
but it would show that the financial
and business conditions throughout the
world were undergoing an improvement
which affected the price -of wheat, the
report concludes.
