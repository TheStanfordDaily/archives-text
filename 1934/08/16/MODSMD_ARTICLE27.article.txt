For the first time in many summer j
quarters it appears as if at least one of i
the men's intramural sports tourna- !
ments would be completed. The quar- |
ter is drawing to a close, but racket- |
.swingers Pommer, Reed, Lilienthal and i
Holt, the survivors in the tennis tourna
ment, have time to set something of a
record if they get together and decide
the championship.
Reed beat Swann 6-4, 6-3; T. Lilien- !
thai beat Studebaker 6-4, 7-5; Pommer i
beat Cassel 6-4, 6-2; and Holt beat !
Hermann 6-1, 8-6, thereby leaving |
Reed to face Lilienthal, and Holt to face '
Pommer in the semi-finals.
Pommer, who wss third ranking I
freshman last spring, looks to be the |
player to stop, because of his easy |
victory over Cassel; but Ted Lilienthal, '
who has earned a varsity tennis letter, ,
should be favored.
