# MAKES SHAKESPEARE WOMEN LIVE AGAIN
## 
### 
By a brilliant interpretation of Shake
speare's "Pathetic Women," Miss Flor
ence Locke, California actress, re
created the mood and performance of
Ellen Terry, most famous of Shake
spearean actresses, last night in the
dance studio of the Women's Gym
nasium.
In a charming period costume which
blended into the various roles she
touched upon—Viola, Desdemona, Emi
lia, Juliet, Queen Katherine, Cordelia,
Imogen, Lady Macbeth, and Ophelia—
Miss Locke talked informally of the
great actress who created the lectures
and then, after the mood had been
created, dropped into Miss Terry's own
words and spirit. An oaken bench, a
table with lighted tapers, and two her
aldic standards formed an impression
istic setting.
For more than an hour and a half
Miss Locke held her audience with Ellen
Terry's brilliant and sensitive analyses
of the ill-starred women whom she
termed, for want of a better word,
"pathetic." These heroines were charac
terized in their own words as well as in
the actress's, for beautiful bits from
the plays were interpolated. These Miss
Locke interpreted in her flexible voice
with just enough dramatic pantomime
to produce the desired effect.
As in a pageant, she brought these
heroines before us, one after another,
revealed their stature as characters and
their individuality as women, let them
speak for themselves, and then pass
from tin stage. It was an impressive
performance, deserving the much
abiised word "unique."'
