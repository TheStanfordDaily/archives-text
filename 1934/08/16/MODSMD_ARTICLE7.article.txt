# Five Year Federal Census Urged by Prof. McKenzie
## 
### 
1 A census at this time, as has been
recently suggested by statisticians, is
"highly desirable," declared Professor
R. D. McKenzie, visiting professor of
I sociology, in an interview last night
j concerning the need for a mid-decade
federal census to account tor artificial
population shifts caused by the deprcs
i sion and recovery.
"Although such a census would not
be as thorough as that of 1930, it would
nevertheless be sufficient to account for
shifts of population that cannot be ac
; counted for by the traditional methods,"
; he said.
j "With the multiplicity of movements'
from one area to another, it is hard to
| estimate what is happening according
, to our old standards," said the Michi
gan sociologist. "The last census showed
that during the preceding decade there!
had been a noticeable movement from
crowded centers to the suburbs, aug
mented by better methods of trans- •
portation and the use of the automobile !
to commute to and from the cities. Only j
• a new census can show whether or not
this movement is in general."
Many people are deserting the city j
j and reclaiming farms, while others are !
j moving to the smaller villages, he J
pointed out. This movement has not.
! been offset by a corresponding move
| ment to the cities and, according to cs- |

I timates, iho shift away from urban
centers amounts to from 300,000 to
500,000 a year, possibly much more for
i the last year.
"A steady decline in population in-
I creases can be accounted for only by a
I declining birth rate and the fact that
j more people are leaving the United
! States each year than are coming in,
since many former immigrants are re
| turning to their homes because of eco
; nomic conditions," he said.
"Our economic system has long been
! geared to an increasing population. It
: is now estimated that the United States
1 will reach a stationary population in
| 1975 with a total of 150,000,000. With
Ihis factor of the increase eliminated,
attention should be turned to develop
' itig the existing markets and upon dis
i tributing wealth so as to secure the
proper buying power, since this will be
1 the only stimulus to industry."
A stationary population would mean
! a greater number of older people, with
i a resultant conservatism in industry and
buying tastes, is Professor McKenzie's
opinion. It is necessary, he thinks, that
, we take these possibilities into consid
' eration far enough in advance to allow
for the proper planning. France has
already reached a stationary population
j and other European countries are rap
idly approaching it.

1 A census at this time, as has been
recently suggested by statisticians, is
"highly desirable," declared Professor
R. D. McKenzie, visiting professor of
I sociology, in an interview last night
j concerning the need for a mid-decade
federal census to account tor artificial
population shifts caused by the deprcs
i sion and recovery.
"Although such a census would not
be as thorough as that of 1930, it would
nevertheless be sufficient to account for
shifts of population that cannot be ac
; counted for by the traditional methods,"
; he said.
j "With the multiplicity of movements'
from one area to another, it is hard to
| estimate what is happening according
, to our old standards," said the Michi
gan sociologist. "The last census showed
that during the preceding decade there!
had been a noticeable movement from
crowded centers to the suburbs, aug
mented by better methods of trans- •
portation and the use of the automobile !
to commute to and from the cities. Only j
• a new census can show whether or not
this movement is in general."
Many people are deserting the city j
j and reclaiming farms, while others are !
j moving to the smaller villages, he J
pointed out. This movement has not.
! been offset by a corresponding move
| ment to the cities and, according to cs- |

I timates, iho shift away from urban
centers amounts to from 300,000 to
500,000 a year, possibly much more for
i the last year.
"A steady decline in population in-
I creases can be accounted for only by a
I declining birth rate and the fact that
j more people are leaving the United
! States each year than are coming in,
since many former immigrants are re
| turning to their homes because of eco
; nomic conditions," he said.
"Our economic system has long been
! geared to an increasing population. It
