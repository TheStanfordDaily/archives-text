# Royce Skow Invents Apparatus To Test Blood in Live Animals
## 
### 
One of the newest contributions to
science, a small, simple-looking glass
bulb conducting an electric current that
will test acidity and alkalinity, has been
made by Royce Skow, graduate student
of physiology. In reality this bulb,
which its inventor has been perfecting
over a number of years, is an exceed
ingly delicate apparatus, superior to the
complicated and clumsy mechanisms
previously devised, accoi'ding to Mr.
Skow.
Because of its small size the bulb can
be inserted directly into the blood
stream of a living experimental animal
to test for chemical action. It can be
used in urinalysis when stain tests fail,
in electro-plating, and in other ways.
Mr. Skow first began working on his
invention when he was studying under
Dr. Lenore Michalis, of the Rockefeller
Institute, world authority in electrode

potential studies, at the Hopkins Marine
Station in Pacific Grove. Later, with
Dr. J. F. Baumberger, associate pro
fessor of physiology, he used the appa
ratus in cancer research at Washington
University, St. Louis. He also .used it
in research for the Carnegie Institute
Laboratories and in an experimental
station on the Tartugus Islands, off the
coast of Florida.
Skow improved his device while at
Washington University, where he was
teaching assistant, and equipped a num
ber of the laboratories. With the aid of
CWA funds he equipped the physiology,
botany, chemistry and biology labora
tories at Stanford, where he is now
working for the Ph.D. degree. Several
commercial manufacturing concerns,
like the Sargeant Instrument Company
of Chicago, which is the largest in the
field, wish to buy his patent.
