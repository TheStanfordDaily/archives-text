# 13 Surveying Students Enroll
## Prof. Thomas's Class Will Practice on Campus Next Month 
### 
Thirteen men have signed up for
the summer surveying course which
will be given during the month of Sep
tember on the Stanford campus, at the
time when there are no other courses
of instruction meeting.
Professor Earl C. Thomas, of the
Civil Engineering department, who will
be instructor, explains that the students
will work 8 hours a day, starting at G
o'clock in the morning so as to avoid
having to work in the mid-day heat.
Registration takes place on Saturday
the first of September, and instruction
begins at 2 o'clock the same afternoon.
Because of the necessity of an early
breakfast, the men will be housed to
gether on the campus, if possible.
The first two weeks of the course
will be spent in making topographic
maps while the last two weeks will be
taken up with making a railroad loca
tion survey.
Those who have signed up for the
course so far are Arthur Allen, John
Cahill, Dwight Charles
Dodge, William Hegy, Randolph Hill,
Earl Kipp, James Mullen, Kenneth Rey
nolds, C. M. Richards, Kelton Steele,
Frank Warren and Frank Morello.
