# Farm Is Logical Spot For Coast School of Music
## Haddock Deplores Absence Of Classical Programs On Radio Hollywood Bowl, S. F. Opera Praised by Director 
### 
"The Pacific Coast iz greatly in need
of a recognized major school of music.
Stanford is eminently the logical place
for its establishment."
Such is the opinion of G. Marston
Haddock, summer lecturer of music at
Stanford and principal of Leeds Col
lege of Music, England. He is well
known for his study and interest in old
English folk songs and ballads, and has
studied voice production, singing, and
interpretation with leading musicians
and singers of both the United States
and Europe. Making his home in Cali
fornia, he returns to Leeds for three
months of each year. He is thus in a
favorable position to draw comparison
between the American and English
viewpoints toward music.
"The British people have had, in gen
eral, a much better opportunity for an
appreciation of music in the last ten
years than have the Americans. With
the advent of radio and the subsequent
establishment in England of a central
advisory board, controlling programs
through the British Broadcasting Cor
poration, the general public has been
given an opportunity to hear the works
of the real masters. There are in Eng
land no sponsored programs.
"In America, on the other hand, we
have given almost free reign to our
advertisers, with the result that the air
is cluttered up with the so-called popu
lar programs. Not more than a few
hours a week of true classical music is
to be found. Men like Alfred Hertz, of
the Standard Symphony programs, and
Walter Damrosch, are alone carrying
forward the true spirit and advance of
classical music and its appreciation in
America, and in a manner which ap
peals to and interests the American
public.
"Nevertheless, in spite of the appar
ent contradiction of elements, the Amer
ican is definitely seeking, and is more
appreciative of, good music than is his
English cousin. Generally considered,
the American public is extremely
receptive, more so than almost any
other country, to classical music.
"Such musical centers as the Holly
wood Bowl, the new San Francisco
Opera House, the endowed symphony
orchestras, and the many groups of
people banded together for the purpose
of advancing the appreciation of class
ical music, are objects of wonder to
the traveling European.
"And yet, there is hardly a school of
music of any consequence, recognized
as such in England, in the whole of the
United States. There are people in my
experience who, looking for a mu
sical education, would fain have gone
to Stanford, but have had to be satis
fied with some smaller and less repu
table college which possessed the vir
tue of a school of music. The move
ment has been started, however, notably
by such patrons as Elizabeth Sprague
Coolidge, and by certain interested men
within the university itself, but it will
take the whole-hearted co-operation of
music-lovers both within and without
the University to I'cach the desired
end."
