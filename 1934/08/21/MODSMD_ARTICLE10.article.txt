War clubs, domestic utensils, and
beaded articles of clothing are included
in a collection of Kaffer articles re
cently put on display in the Stanford
Museum by Frank B. de Lemos, acting
curator. The collection was given by
Mrs. M. L. Van Norden, formerly Miss
Elizabeth Bradford, predecessor to Miss
Yost as Dean of Women. The pieces
were acquired by Mr. Van Norden while
he was hunting for big game in Africa.
"The articles are remarkable for
their craftsmanship and originality of
design," said Mr. de Lemos. "Hare com
binations of color are used, which Euro
peans would consider clashing, but
which have been neutralized by the
use of a harmonizing shade. These
primitive people are so closely in touch
with nature that they can draw directly
from it, unimpeded lay the conventional
patterns of more civilized races."
The collection has such things as war
clubs of woven leather, or of wood
worked over with an inlay of brass and
copper threads. The pillows of Zulu
land are made of carved wood, which
is the material used for all household
utensils such as spoons and bowls.
There are numerous specimens of these
â€”also two straw bags used for strain
ing Kaffer beer, and pipe bojvls carved
from ebony in symbolic animal forms.
The ornaments used for personal adorn
ment are made from wood, bone, and
beads.
