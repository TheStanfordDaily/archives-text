# Individual Plan Of Study Best, Says Dr. Eurick
## Visiting Educator Says That Independent Study Will Replace 'Spoon-Feeding' Stanford's Liberal Policy In Education Praised 
### 
Enthusiastically, Dr. Alvin C. Eurich,
visiting faculty member from the Uni
versity of Minnesota, yesterday told of
the tremendous contemporary develop
ment of the independent study plan in
universities throughout the United
States.
Dr. Eurich, head of the University of
Minnesota's educational research de
partment, said that Stanford's particular
type of independent work is spreading
through many colleges. But in each uni
versity the plans differ; each has its own
idea and methods, he added.
An expert in the field of educational
psychology, Dr. Eurich believes that
within a very short time university
study plans will develop more and more
along the independent line. "We are
just beginning to realize that the 'spoon
feeding' method is not as effective as
the independent study plan," he in
sisted.
Self-Impelled Study Best
A recent survey of the American Edu
cational Society proves beyond doubt
that the self-impelled method of study
is by far the best, Dr. Eurich said.
Effective instruction is contained in the
personal touch between the student and
his instructor working together on
something of interest to the student
and within the knowledge and direc
tion of the instructor, he added.
Dr. Eurich said that as the independ
ent study plan develops, instruction and
work will be given the student which
will educate him thoroughly from the
point which he has reached. All this is
to keep from repeating a study with
which the student is already familiar,
he said.
Stanford Enthusiastic
Eurich said the students at Stan
ford that he has met in the independent
work are a# very enthusiastic about it,
and that the plan is working well here.
Eurich told of the plans at the Uni
versity of Chicago. Comprehensive ex
aminations have been worked out so
that a student may do four years of
college work in one. The passing of the
exams allows the student to attain a
certain level of scholarship, instead of
sitting a certain number of hours in a
clans room to graduate, he added.
The University of Minnesota has
somewhat the same plan, in that they
have a certain set of tests which the
students must pass to complete lower
division work, according to Dr. Eurich.
Harvard Different
A third method differing from Stan
ford's is that of Harvard, where stu
dents live in halls with their tutors
and get personal attention and super
vision.
A plan at the University of Min
nesota to be installed this fall will
enable the student to go to all the
classes he wants to, and do as much
work as he chooses. This plan is open
to students in the upper division, and
has no requisite of a certain grade
average, according to Dr. Eurich.
The earliest institution to develop
independence in school work in the
United States is Swarthmore, whiclj
began with honor reading courses in
| which students got credit for independ
! ent reading, Eurich said.
"It's all the getting back to the idea
I of a satisfactory relationship between
! the master and the student," Eurich
! explained.
The opportunity for radical changes
j in curriculum and methods in univer
: sities has been provided by the formal
| recognition of the fact that a school
| exists to adapt itself to the student and
] not to be adapted to by the student,
| Eurich said. The North Central Associa
j tion of Colleges and Secondary Schools
| has provided this recognition by doing
| away with the time-honored artificial
I standards formerly required of accred
! ited universities, he added.
System Will Grow
Eurich predicts a complete growth of
j the independent study plan and says
j "we have been following a perfectly
1 absurd plan for a long time."
Opposition to this growth will come
from college professors and instructors
[ who believe the plan is lowering the
| standards, and who believe that a good
; university can only be like the one
I which they attended, Eurich warned.
The chief difficulty in procedure with
1 the plan is the determination of the
i pupil's standing in relation to back
ground, Dr. Eurich said. Tests to deter
mine the student's position are ex
-1 tremely difficult to make up, he added.

A plan at the University of Min
nesota to be installed this fall will
enable the student to go to all the
classes he wants to, and do as much
work as he chooses. This plan is open
to students in the upper division, and
has no requisite of a certain grade
average, according to Dr. Eurich.
The earliest institution to develop
independence in school work in the
United States is Swarthmore, whiclj
began with honor reading courses in

"It's all the getting back to the idea
I of a satisfactory relationship between

The opportunity for radical changes
j in curriculum and methods in univer
: sities has been provided by the formal
| recognition of the fact that a school
| exists to adapt itself to the student and
] not to be adapted to by the student,
| Eurich said. The North Central Associa
j tion of Colleges and Secondary Schools
| has provided this recognition by doing
| away with the time-honored artificial
I standards formerly required of accred
! ited universities, he added.
System Will Grow
Eurich predicts a complete growth of
j the independent study plan and says
j "we have been following a perfectly
1 absurd plan for a long time."
Opposition to this growth will come
from college professors and instructors
[ who believe the plan is lowering the
| standards, and who believe that a good
; university can only be like the one
I which they attended, Eurich warned.
The chief difficulty in procedure with
1 the plan is the determination of the
i pupil's standing in relation to back
ground, Dr. Eurich said. Tests to deter
mine the student's position are ex
-1 tremely difficult to make up, he added.
Dr. Eurich had words of praise for
Enthusiastically, Dr. Alvin C. Eurich,
visiting faculty member from the Uni
versity of Minnesota, yesterday told of
the tremendous contemporary develop
ment of the independent study plan in
universities throughout the United
States.
Dr. Eurich, head of the University of
Minnesota's educational research de
partment, said that Stanford's particular
type of independent work is spreading
through many colleges. But in each uni
versity the plans differ; each has its own
idea and methods, he added.
An expert in the field of educational
psychology, Dr. Eurich believes that
within a very short time university
study plans will develop more and more
along the independent line. "We are
just beginning to realize that the 'spoon
feeding' method is not as effective as
the independent study plan," he in
sisted.
Self-Impelled Study Best
A recent survey of the American Edu
cational Society proves beyond doubt
that the self-impelled method of study
is by far the best, Dr. Eurich said.
Effective instruction is contained in the
personal touch between the student and
his instructor working together on
something of interest to the student
and within the knowledge and direc
tion of the instructor, he added.
Dr. Eurich said that as the independ
ent study plan develops, instruction and
work will be given the student which
will educate him thoroughly from the
point which he has reached. All this is
to keep from repeating a study with
which the student is already familiar,
he said.
Stanford Enthusiastic
Eurich said the students at Stan
ford that he has met in the independent
work are a# very enthusiastic about it,
and that the plan is working well here.
Eurich told of the plans at the Uni
versity of Chicago. Comprehensive ex
aminations have been worked out so
that a student may do four years of
college work in one. The passing of the
exams allows the student to attain a
certain level of scholarship, instead of
sitting a certain number of hours in a
clans room to graduate, he added.
The University of Minnesota has
somewhat the same plan, in that they
have a certain set of tests which the
students must pass to complete lower
division work, according to Dr. Eurich.
Harvard Different
A third method differing from Stan
ford's is that of Harvard, where stu
dents live in halls with their tutors
and get personal attention and super
vision.
