The Stanford Daily lias 110 editorial policy. Those who have fol
lowed the editorials this summer are well aware of that fact. No one
governing policy has had to he considered. Instead, the editorials have
sought to present their particular ideas according to the viewpoint which
the writer considered would he most interesting- to his readors. I low
ever, an editorial is more than just a statement. It implies a conclu
sion of some sort on the part of the writer, and the conclusions are of
course liable to attack. One should hear in mind that under these condi
tions a conclusion is by no means a dogma, as it is apt to be where the
writer is of necessity playing to a definite policy, but is rather a tenta
tive opinion. The reader is not told that such a thing is so, but is
presented with the facts and, for his consideration, the opinion of the
•particular editorial writer.
The conclusion to be drawn from this is that the policy of no policy
is likely to prove a distinct advantage to the particular newspaper, in
that it eliminates all suspicion of propaganda or coloring—political or
otherwise. A newspaper must ordinarily classify itself within the minds
cf a particular class of readers—radical, conservative, democratic, or
< thcrwise, in order to he assured of an influential position. Divided
policy, the favorite outdoor sport of the contemporary politician, is well
known and contemptuously recognized as the art of fence straddling.
The politician may practice the art to advantage, for the memory of the
voting public is notoriously short, and the politician need only employ
the art over a comparatively small period of time, viz., that immediately
before election. The newspaper, on the other hand, is continuously be
fore the public eye, and any change of policy, much less division, is apt
Vto prove disastrous. All of this leads to but one inescapable end, the
coloring of the news. No paper which plays to policy can avoid it. for
no policy has yet been discovered which will handle impartially a radical
situation on a conservative newspaper. A. M.
