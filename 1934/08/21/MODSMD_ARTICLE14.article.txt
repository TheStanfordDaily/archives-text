# Campaign Methods
## 
### 
Now that the political campaigns for the forthcoming primary elec
tions have reached their zenith, one has an excellent opportunity to
study the psychological aspect of the current vote-getting techniques.
Aside from the usual debates on issues and campaign promises, there
are numerous procedures to which all candidates must confirm (gen
erally against their will) simply because it is "the thing to do."
For example, they must expend large sums of money for advertise
ments. generally containing only the office-seeker's picture and a catch
word slogan. They must appear at picnics, baseball games and rodeo's
â€”not to speak on the platforms there but merely to shake hands with
the crowds and wave greetings to potential votes. There are numerous
other practices which throw little light on the characters and platforms
of the individual candidates, but are essential parts of the regular
cam pa ign p roced u res.
Were it possible to obtain a concrete measurement of the psycho
logical effect of such practices on the voting public it is improbable that
they would exist, yet. since no progress has been made in this field, these
superfluous phases of our political "campaigns have become, abetted by
tradition, .firmly entrenched in our pre-election procedure. R. 11. I!.
