# Specialization?
## 
### 
Advocates of a broader curriculum requirement probably will not
deny the advantages of specialism. They will object, rather, to the par
ticular type of specialism now existing in our social sciences. It recalls
the case of the Chicago heiress who was sued for reneging on a contract
to buy a horse, and gave the excuse that the steed did not fit her saddle.
Similarly, a student who specializes so narrowly that he does not even
know the fundamentals of most of the social sciences finds himself trying
to fit his problems to his technique when he ought to be doing the
contrary.
Say that you are an economics major, and that your father involves
you in a discussion of the New Deal. You think you come off pretty
well on the gold policy. But what about Congress turning over so much
of its power to the President? You did not study government. When
great social tides once get up momentum, can "measures" really do much
to stop them? You passed up sociology. New-dealism may be succeeded
by Fascism or Bolshevism. What is your opinion of the human expe
riences which each must tend to encourage or thwart? You never gave
philosophy a chance to introduce you to problems of ethics and values.
By ibis time Dad is wondering whether he or the country can afford
such highly specialized young gentlemen—The Stecplejack (Dartmouth).
