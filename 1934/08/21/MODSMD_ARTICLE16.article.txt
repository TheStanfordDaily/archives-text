# SOCIAL GAP BRIDGE AIM OF WISCONSIN SCIENCE INQUIRY'
## First Step Made to Bring Social and Natural Science Together 
### 
First steps in a Science Inquiry, de
signed to close the "social gap" between
the natural and social sciences at the
University of Wisconsin —a move that
may point the way to similar efforts on
a nation-wide scale — have just been
completed through the co-operative
efforts of some 200 faculty members.
Inaugurated in December, 1933, by
President Frank and other faculty mem
bers, the Science Inquiry was aimed to
meet the demand that science contrib
ute more help to solving social prob
lems facing the nation today.
Recognizing that science has itself
caused many new social problems and
that the epidemic of social planning
now sweeping the world is calling for
scientific aid in almost every social field,
the Inquiry has made it possible for
University faculty members to review
its activities in science in the light of
changing social conditions, President
Frank said.
The Inquiry was deliberately aimed
to ascertain the extent to which the
natural sciences of the University are
considering the social implications of
their work, and how such considera
tion is reflected in teaching, research,
extension, and outside activities of the
University, a report of the Inquiry
reveals.
It also attempted to determine the
extent to which the natural scientists
are in touch with and co-operating
with the social scientists in fields com
mon to both, and the extent to which
the social scientists are taking ad
vantage of the contributions of the nat
ural scientists to problems in which
they are mutually interested.
The Inquiry also tried to ascertain
in general whether the University is
using its natural and social science re
sources to the best advantage in teach
ing and research concerned with the
many problems of public interest in
which both natural and social sciences
are concerned, the report explains.
Problems corpmon to both natural
and social sciences which were con
sidered by the various faculty mem
bers who helped make the inquiry in
clude the following: conservation,
land-use, lakes, mineral resources and
the social sciences, forestry, engineer
ing and its social implications; tech
nological unemployment, public regu
lation of utilities, transportation, con
sumption, plant improvement, indus
trial utilization of farm crops, chem
istry, physics, public health, child de
velopment, reorganization of local gov
ernment, international relations, cattle
improvement, wild life, and agriculture
in general.
* In explaining its objectives, the in
quiry report points out that from the
very beginning of its history science
has tended to disturb the religious,
social, economic, and political status
quo, and has been the subject of more
or less public protest.
''The recent outcry, arising from the
accelerating impetus of scientific
achievement during the last few dec
ades, and aggravated by special condi
tions of the world war and the recent
depression, is nothing really new,"
the report declares. "A part of the pub
lic is again expressing its alarm and is
calling on science either to stop its ad
vances until social adjustments can be
made or to contribute more aid
formerly to the social questions raised
by scientific advances.
"In the present Inquiry no attempt
is made to discuss the demand that
the advances in science be stopped,
because we assume that the impetus
of science makes this attempt futile,"
the report maintains. "The demand that
science contribute more help to solving
social problems seems to have a more
reasonable basis, and our inquiry has
therefore confined its attention to this
question."
The inquiry revealed that University
treatment of problems in the combined
field of natural and social sciences has
been too much departmentalized, that
there is a promising field of co-opera
tive effort between social and natural
sciences still unoccupied, and that in
the natural sciences particularly not
enough attention is being given to the
social bearing of scientific findings, the
report states.
