# GEORGE STERLING'S MANUSCRIPT HERE
## 
### 
Two recent additions to the Univer
sity Library's collection of literary
manuscripts are of exceptional interest.
One is the original holograph copy of
George Sterling's poem "The Hidden
Pool" signed by the poet and the other
a typescript of his "A White Rose" also
signed. Both of these are the gift of
Albert M. Bender, of San Francisco.
Both scholars and collectors are
moved by books and manuscripts which
represent an intimacy between two cre
ative minds; for example, presentation
copies of one author's work to another,
correspondence between authors, and
particularly manuscripts which set
forth the processes of collaboration.
The typescript of "A White Rose" men
tioned above belongs to the latter cate
gory. The original typewritten version
signed by Sterling was apparently
handed to Ambrose Bierce for criti
cism. Sterling has written four queries
in the margins and Bierce not only has
pencilled in his comments thereon but
has added to others.
The final stanza, which reads as fol
lows, has been deleted entirely in the
typescript:
"O little waifs of Time and Change!
There stits no Voice beyond the
years.
Behold, our destinies are strange,
And sad with unavailing tears!"
Both Sterling and Bierce had diffi
culties with this one as is clearly indi
cated by the accompanying suggestions
and alterations.
