"LOUDER, PLEASE"
At the Palo Alto Commuity Theatre
"Louder, Please" is another Holly
wood farce, this time on Movieland's
publicity agents and their methods. The
play was evidently chosen for its au
dience-drawing value, but it required a
fast tempo and a sense of timing on the
part of its actors which the amateur cast
of the Community Players was unable
to give it. This was unfortunate, as
rapid-fire farces lose their pungency
when poorly played.
Possibly the best performance was
that of Frances Abbott as a gum Tchew
ing, overworked secretary. Although
not a main role, Miss Abbott made it
one of the more enjoyable features of
the evening.
Although the word "smooth" was
probably never intended to describe an
actress' performance, yet that is just
how Yvonne Peattie's performance im
pressed this writer. Hers was another
of the few really good performances of
the evening.
v David Stollery, a former Stanford
man, had the leading role of the Holly
wood press-agent. His playing for the
most part had the necessary verve and
zest, but this he lost in places.
Thomas Seller, who is well-known on
the campus for his performances in
Sword and Sandals play readings, was
excellent in a minor role.
The most unfortunate occurrence of
the production came in the third act,
wTien one of the minor characters
blew up in his lines, and left the cast
stalling around for the proper cues and
lines. Although it was covered up
rather well, nevertheless this error
spoiled the tempo of the play and its
effectiveness also.
If this one production is typical of
the Community Players (and it may
not be) then Stanford productions are
undeniably superior. —Bernheim
Paris has a talking clock, which auto
matically tells the time when rung up.
Four million people used this service in
one year.
