## 
### 
James Sandoe, well-known local
actor, will make his last campus ap
pearance tomorrow right at 8 o'clock
in the Little Theatre as Metternich in
Sword and Sandals' reading of Ros
trand's "L'Aiglon." He is leaving Au
gusts for graduate work at Columbia.
Sandoe has a long line of dramatic
successes to his credit, including "Dr.
Faustus," "Enemy of the People," and
"Berkeley Square." This summer he
directed "Lady Windermere's Fan" for
the Community Players. The role of
the crafty Austrian diplomat will be a
departure from his recent comedy por
trayals in "The Rivals" and "Let 'Em Eat
Cake." It will furnish Sandoe with a
chance to portray steel-like power be
hind a perfect mask cl elegance.
Frances Slanina, who starred last
Wednesday in the Spanish play, will
read the sensitive role of Theresa de
Loget. Her brother, Tiburtius, will be
read .by Garrett Starmer, not a Stan
ford student, who played in New York
last season in "Growing Pains." Wil
liam Gwinn, who has been prominent
this summer in the casts of "The Doc
tor's Wife" and "The Rivals," will take
an important part. Charles Denny, who
was the lover in "The Circle," will por
tray the attache, and Hugh Baker, who
excells in gruff comedy, will read the
small part of Sedlnizky.
Robert Brauns, as previously an
nounced, will take the lines in the title
role of the "Eaglet."
Others in the cast include Frank
O'Neill, Thomas Seller, Frank Dorsey,
James McElney, Isabel Stowell, Lucie
Bentley, and George Wilson. Dr. Mar
gery Bailey, who was Lady Kitty in
"The Circle" and who was "The Doc
tor's Wife," will read stage directions.
Louis N. Parker's excellent transla
tion of the play has been cut, and the
result is a rapid, exciting script, full of
brilliant dialogue and sharply-defined
climaxes. The mystery of court in
trigue, the sheer excitement of the plot
for the Duke's escape, and the poetry
of the lines combine with the real
tragedy in the Eaglet's own character to
make a vital and colorful historical
drama.
An admission fee of ten cents will be
charged to cove? royalty.
