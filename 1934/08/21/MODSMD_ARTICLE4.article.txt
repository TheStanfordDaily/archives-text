# Religion Personal, Says Patton in Chapel Service
## 
### 
"Religion, being the most 'inside' of
all things, is personal in the sense that
you can always take it or leave it," said
the Rev. Carl S. Patton in his talk on
"Personal Religion" in the Memorial
Church Sunday. The Rev. Mr. Patton is
from the Pacific School of Religion at
Berkeley.
Religion is personal in the sense that
every man makes his own religion, and
it is never exactly like that of any other
man.
"Religion is not a mere hod-carrier
to morality. It exists in its own right,"
claimed the speaker.
Tho religious man is not a man with
something sprouted on him which dJher
people do not have; he is the moral
man.
