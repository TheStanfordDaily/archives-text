# Hand Stresses Place of Free High School
## "Secondary Institutions Are Interpreting Modern Marvels" "American Ideals Are Taught And Emphasized" 
### 
The free public secondary school must
be regarded as one of the most highly
cherished institutions of our American
democracy, pointed out Professor Har
old C. Hand, assistant professor of edu
cation, over the Stanford Radio Hour
last night. Dr. Hand, who spoke over
KPO at 8:30, said that our teachers are
deeply in sympathy with the democratic
aspirations of the American people.
He chose as his subject for discus
sion, "New Developments in Secondary
Education," and spoke of the major
changes which have taken place in this
type of education. He showed first that
those relating to the curriculum are
among the most significant.
"We are today living in an age of
science; new marvels of invention are
almost daily coming over the horizon
and the modern secondary school is
interpreting the hundred and one ev
eryday manifestations of modern sci
ence and preparing its students for a
sane and healthy life in such an en
vironment," said Dr. Hand. "In the
better secondary schools everywhere,
students are today being helped to bet
ter understand the man-controlled won
ders which surround them on every
side, to acquire an appreciation of the
universal operation of natural law, and
to take the scientific attitude toward all
problems."
Secondary Schools Important
"It is becoming increasingly clear to
teachei's that the future welfare and
happiness of their students will be de
pendent upon their ability to under
stand and to control their social en
vironment. It is apparent that teachers
recognize the necessity of securing the
allegiance of their students to our
American democratic tradition —to the
| Great American Dream of improving
the lot of the common man."
Professor Hand said that persons who
| really know what is going on in the
i secondary school will recognize as un
'true the extravagant charge that the
democratic ideal is being forsaken and
that communistic beliefs are being en
dorsed. The professional educators have
not discovered in the schools which
they daily administer the existence of
the alleged communistic teachings,
while certain super-patriots with little
or no contact with the schools claim to
know of much subversive teaching.
How To Use Leisure t
Dr. Hand continued his address by
considering the role of the progressive
secondary school in training students
for the intelligent use of leisure. "Stu
dents are being helped, to equip them
selves with a variety of fundamentally
necessary inner resources. Attempts
are being made to equip each second
ary school student with at least one in
tellectual hobby, one aesthetic hobby,
one physical hobby, and one handicraft.
They are being trained as consumers
and as amateur producers of handi
crafts and the aesthetic arts.
"In vocal and in instrumental group
music, our secondary school students
are today being trained both as con
sumers and as amateur producers. Since
the advent of the radio we have had
abundant evidence of the inadequacy
