## 
### 
Professor Ralph H. Gabriel, visiting
member of the Stanford history fac
ulty, lectured last Thursday at 8
o'clock in the dance studio of the Wom
en's Gymnasium on the subject of "The
American Religion of Humanity."
Professor Gabriel discussed the three
social philosophies that became impor
tant in America during the nineteenth
century. As he puts them, they are the
Christian philosophy, Spencerian deter
minism, and the American religion of
humanity. He added to the discussion
of these philosophies a consideration of
some problems in present day social
thinking, with special reference to the
concept of the planned society.
Professor Gabriel has been a member
of the Yale faculty since 1915. He grad
uated from that institution with the
class of 1913. Besides being a professor
of history, he is a well known author.
