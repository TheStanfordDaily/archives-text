# Wadia Defines "Great Soul's" Quest In India
## Philosopher from Bombay Attacks Propaganda Of British Speaker Explains Gandhi's Salt Protest 
### Gray Creveling 
Tuesday night a small Stanford au
dience heard Dr. P. A. Wadia give the
views and beliefs of the followers of
Ganadhi and his "Non-cooperation"
movement in India.
Dean of the faculty of arts and pro
fessor in the departments of philosophy
and political science in the University
of Bombay, Wadia is himself a devout
follower of the Great Soul.
"Americans are grossly ignorant of
real Indian conditions because of Brit
ish propaganda," the Indian economist
declared. "There is no liberty of any
kind for us in India today. The press
cannot print a favorable story or pic
ture of a man who is a member of one
of the parties opposing the present gov
ernment. A storekeeper cannot sell food
or goods to a member of those 120
blacklisted parties without a great fine.
How is the shopkeeper to know who is
and who is not a member of those
â€¢ parties?
Freedom Is Highest Value
"All this repression and cruelty has
been sharpened by Gandhi's movement
which is today four years old. Gandhi
critics may point to these results of his
efforts, but to judge love by its conse
quences is to debase that love. The
movement is an attempt at spiritualiz
ing the fields of politics. It is an ex
periment in the direction of love."
Dr. Wadia told how Gandhi proceeded
with his ideas by telling his followers
to break the Indian salt law which gives
the government a monopoly on salt,
and salt is sold at a price which pro
hibits the poor from buying enough to
meet their needs.
Gandhi's followers who lived along
the coast of India were asked to distill
their own salt out /of the sea-water. His
followers were jailed and beaten. When
Gandhi saw that this procedure was
not successful, he believed that by sac
rificing himself he could bring about
the repentance of the government offi
cials.
"Gandhi believes that the rule of In
dia by the British is the embodiment of
something unrighteous and immoral be
cause of the exploitation of Indian
people by British companies," Dr. Wadia
asserted. Gandhi objects to one nation
dictating and directing the destinies of
another."
Gandhi Attracts Finest
Dr. Wadia's interpretation of Gandhi's
attitude might be well expressed in the
proverb that a fool can put on his pants
better than a wise man can do it for
him.
Smiling nervously out from under a
pair of gold-rimmed spectacles, Wadia
went on to say that there pre hun
dreds of thousands of the finest
souls in India sincerely wrapped up in
Gandhi's beliefs.
"They have taken the crudest of
treatment without- complaint, merely
because their leader asked them to do
so," he said. "War-like people who oth
erwise would object to inhuman treat
ment did not complain, but devoutly
followed his wishes."
