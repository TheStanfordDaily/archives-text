## 
### 
Dr. Eliot G. Mears, director of the
summer quarter, yesterday commented
on the work of the quarter in the fol
lowing statement:
Reports coming to my office indi
cate that this summer quarter has been
unusually worthwhile. Several visiting
professors have expressed themselves
as impressed with the serious purpose
and intellectual culture of our students,
and on every hand I hear of the bene
fits which we all receive from the inti
mate contacts with our notable visiting
faculty.
The presence of distinguished schol
ars from other institutions supple
mented by our own regular staff pro
vides a choice opportunity for the sum
mer quarter student.
The public lectures by visiting pro
fessors have been much appreciated.
"The Doctor's Wife" and a varied series
of entertainments have been exceed
ingly well patronized. The six Pro Arte
concerts, the gift of Mrs. Elizabeth
Sprague Coolidge, have been a wonder
ful treat to our summer community.
Active plans for next summer prom
ise another session of special interest
and real worth.
