# Brauns, Sandoe Star In Reading Of Rostand Play
## Sword and Sandals Interprets Drama of Napoleon's Son In Restitution Plot Last Presentation Featured By Dramatic Heights 
### Philip Bernheim 
It becomes increasingly difficult to
praise Sword and Sandals' readings as
each becomes increasingly better. The
reading of Rostand's "L'Aiglon" last
night in the Little Theatre was a more
than excellent finale to the summer
series.
Robert Brauns gave what may easily
have been the best performance of his
career in the title role of Napoleon's
son. His acting reached heights of dra
matic excellence in many places. Par
ticularly noteworthy were the moments
when Metternich, the ' Austrian chan
cellor, played upon the weaknesses of
the young prince's character by con
juring up in his mind visions of his
depraved and insane Hapsburg ances
tors. Another climax which Brauns
carried off magnificently was his scene
alnne on the battlefield of Wagram,
scene of Napoleon's triumph.
James Sandoe abandoned his port
folio of comic characters to play the
cunning Metternich. He was fully equal
to the character, reading his lines with
a biting humor. Sandoe can always be
depended upon to add to the excellence
of a Sword and Sandals evening, and it
is greatly to be regretted that he is
leaving soon for the East.
Old Men Well Played
A. Grove Day as Emperor Francis I
of Austria, and Frank Dorsey as Gen
eral Dietrichstein, tutor of "the Eag
let," had the difficult task of rendering
the voice and spirit of old men. This
Ihey did extremely well. The scene
between the young prince and his
grandfather, the Emperor Francis, was
touching in its simplicity and sincerity.
Frank O'Neill, who was the neurotic
Wilson Everrett in "The Doctor's
Wife," played a foppish and dissolute
aide to Metternich with practiced per
fection. (No insinuation intended).
Lucie Bentley as the flighty Maria
Louisa, Napoleon's widow, and mother
of the Eaglet, was quite good. Frances
Slanina did very well in a minor fem
inine role, as did the other two women,
Shelley Smith and Isabel Stowell.
Thomas Seller was very well suited
to the role of Flambeau, an old ser
geant of Napoleon's armies, and now a
member of the conspiracy to restore the
Bonaparte regime. The seasoned trooper
was ever faithful, even to giving his
life for the young prince.
Staging Stiperior
The production last night was un
usualy well staged. It was a bit diffi
cult to conduct the tete-a-tetes in the
first scene between people on opposite
sides of the stage, yet it was managed
quite smoothly. The throne-like chair
which was provided for the Eaglet in
several of the scenes added greatly to
the spirit of the play, while the lighting
effects in the scene on the battlefield
at Wagram greatly increased its effec
tiveness. Judicious cutting of the script
reduced it to reasonable running time.
It takes 14 days for a snail to travel
one mile.

tiveness. Judicious cutting of the script
reduced it to reasonable running time.
It takes 14 days for a snail to travel
one mile.
It becomes increasingly difficult to
praise Sword and Sandals' readings as
each becomes increasingly better. The
reading of Rostand's "L'Aiglon" last
night in the Little Theatre was a more
than excellent finale to the summer
series.
Robert Brauns gave what may easily
have been the best performance of his
career in the title role of Napoleon's
son. His acting reached heights of dra
matic excellence in many places. Par
ticularly noteworthy were the moments
when Metternich, the ' Austrian chan
cellor, played upon the weaknesses of
the young prince's character by con
juring up in his mind visions of his
depraved and insane Hapsburg ances
tors. Another climax which Brauns
carried off magnificently was his scene
alnne on the battlefield of Wagram,
scene of Napoleon's triumph.
James Sandoe abandoned his port
folio of comic characters to play the
cunning Metternich. He was fully equal
to the character, reading his lines with
a biting humor. Sandoe can always be
depended upon to add to the excellence
of a Sword and Sandals evening, and it
is greatly to be regretted that he is
leaving soon for the East.
Old Men Well Played
A. Grove Day as Emperor Francis I
of Austria, and Frank Dorsey as Gen
eral Dietrichstein, tutor of "the Eag
let," had the difficult task of rendering
the voice and spirit of old men. This
Ihey did extremely well. The scene
between the young prince and his
grandfather, the Emperor Francis, was
touching in its simplicity and sincerity.
Frank O'Neill, who was the neurotic
Wilson Everrett in "The Doctor's
Wife," played a foppish and dissolute
aide to Metternich with practiced per
fection. (No insinuation intended).
Lucie Bentley as the flighty Maria
Louisa, Napoleon's widow, and mother
of the Eaglet, was quite good. Frances
Slanina did very well in a minor fem
inine role, as did the other two women,
Shelley Smith and Isabel Stowell.
Thomas Seller was very well suited
to the role of Flambeau, an old ser
geant of Napoleon's armies, and now a
member of the conspiracy to restore the
Bonaparte regime. The seasoned trooper
was ever faithful, even to giving his
life for the young prince.
Staging Stiperior
The production last night was un
usualy well staged. It was a bit diffi
cult to conduct the tete-a-tetes in the
first scene between people on opposite
sides of the stage, yet it was managed
quite smoothly. The throne-like chair
which was provided for the Eaglet in
several of the scenes added greatly to
the spirit of the play, while the lighting
effects in the scene on the battlefield
at Wagram greatly increased its effec
tiveness. Judicious cutting of the script
reduced it to reasonable running time.
