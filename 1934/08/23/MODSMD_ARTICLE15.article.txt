year, not to attract a large numl>er of persons for all too hrief a period
who merely want to earn a few more credits or to get a little hit of
intellectual stimulation along with a modicum of recreation. Stanford's
summer quarter is just another quarter with some few differentiations.
Where there are differentiations they are made with the view to
providing facilities for graduate study and research. The numerous
visiting professors who are brought from all parts of the world aid
in this plan, and the courses offered appeal to graduate, upper division,
and lower division students in the order named. It is this plan which
differentiates the Stanford summer quarter from many of the familiar
summer "sessions."
Incidentally, the summer quarter just ending is regarded as one of
tiie most successful in recent years although there was little recovery
