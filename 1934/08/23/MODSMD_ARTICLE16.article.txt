# Democracy Survives
## 
### 
One hundred and fifty years ago the world looked toward democracy
as a salvation. The stern oppression of liberty by the autocracies of
Kurope invoked hate and fear for that system of government and gave
democracy its chance. The world has moved rapidly since those dark
days of revolution and chaos, and at present fickle thought is turning
from democracy to other forms of governmentâ€”communism, socialism,
and fascism. The vision of the decline of democracy has been increas
ing in the minds of the masses, especially since the war. But is this so
tailed failure due to faults in the system of democracy as such, or are the
contributing causes developments of other factors which do not lie at
the door of democracy?
In the United States democracy has worked better than any other
system of government in the history of the world. A wider diffusion
of wealth has been effected here than in any other country and the
standard of living has been consequently high. In Kurope, because of
the depleted conditions resulting from the war, it is doubtful if any
system of government could have worked satisfactorily, and it is folly
to blame democracy in the face of evils which would have inhibited
any system'. Europe, in a large measure, lias condemned democracy
without fair tri;J. It cannot be argued that America will do the same.
To throw out a system of government because it does not quickly
eliminate evils inherent in civilization since the dawn lr>f history is not
only useless but destructive. Democracy has given us the greatest civi
lization in history: it is still more valuable and useful than any other
system yet devised. A correction of the faults will carry us much
farther than an elimination of the system. J. \V. 11.
