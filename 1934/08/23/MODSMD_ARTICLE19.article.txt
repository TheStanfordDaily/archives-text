# First Regular Daily To Be Sent Out on September 20
## 
### 
The first publication of the Stanford
Daily will be sent to all of last year's
students on September 20. The regular
issues will start on the opening day of
school. All other campus publications
will come out as scheduled.
The Stanford Chapparral will feature
a "Big Shot" number next year that was
made popular in the days of Barney
Gould. All of the Hammer and Coffin
"Greats" of days gone by will contrib
ute to the issue, and Stanford students
will have a chance to recall the old
Chappie writers and artists. Jim Algar,
last year's "old boy," will send in - car
toons from Hollywood where he is
working for the Walt Disney produc
tions.
The Quad will go on sale on registra-Â»
tion day, and will add a new artist to
make the drawings for the next issue.
