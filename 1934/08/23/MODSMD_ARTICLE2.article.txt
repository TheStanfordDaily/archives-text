That only one out of 32 Cal
women have "everything" is the
conclusion reached by a jury of
eight Cal publications men who
conducted a personal investigation
into the matter last Sunday.
Sitting on the steps of Eshleman
Hall, the jury tabulated the results
of an hour's observation. In grad
ing the local female population, the
gentlemen of the jury used three
classifications—good, fair, and bad.
"A 'good' girl," reads the report,
"is one you would take to a dance.
A 'fair' girl is one you might take
to a show — provided the lights
don't go on. Girls listed as 'bad'
(350 out of 422) would not be suit
able to take to a dog fight even if
you knew both the dogs."
The male jury finally gave up in
disgust and admitted that the cam
pus beauty situation was "even
worse than one would have
imagined."
