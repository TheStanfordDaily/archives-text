# Registration Dance Will Be First Autumn Function
## 
### 
The first social event of the regular
school year—the traditional registra
tion dance—will take place on the night
of October 2 in the women's gymnasium.
This year the dance will be under the
auspices of Cap and Gown, who will
use the money obtained for the schol
arships they sponsor. The price of
admission to the dance has not as yet
been announced, but it will be fixed at
a low level so that all students may
attend.
With the increased registration of
women this fall, it is cxpccted that a
large group of students will take ad
vantage of this dance and forget their
studies for one more day. The orches
tra will be announced at an early date.
