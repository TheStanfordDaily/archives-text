# PANHELLENIC GROUP AND MEN'S FRATERNITY COUNCIL ANNOUNCE RUSHING RULE CHANGES
## Chairman Cobb Emphasizes Importance of Football Men's Rule 
### 
With the increased number oÂ£ women j
this fall, Panhellenic faces many per- I
pjexing problems. Under the leader
ship of Margaret Taylor, president, a
number of rules regulating rushing and
bidding have undergone changes to
facilitate the rushing of the sororities.
Some of the most important rules are,
the following:
1. Spring and summer rushing is con
sidered unethical conduct, and as
such is subject to penalty. Spring
and summer rushing consists in en
tertainment of new women on or off
the campus, previous to their matric
ulation, in parties at which there is
no member of another sorority pres
ent.
2. Bidding shall take place in winter
quarter and in spring quarter accord
ing to a plan to be agreed upon.
3. All affiliated transfers must live in
the house. If a chapter on the Stan
lord campus wishes to affiliate a
transfer who is entering with autumn
quarter, the chapter must noti{y the
Dean of Women of intention to af
filiate the transfer by the 15th of
September.
4. The period of rushing shall be di
vided into two parts: entertaining in
autumn quarter for five days when
new women may not accept more
than one date with the same house;
and rushing for a period of 8 days in
winter quarter, during which a house
may not make more than one date in
advance with a new woman.
5. No sorority woman can be in a
private room in any University hous
ing group with a new woman even
though a sponsor is present. Pan?
Hellenic encourages social contact
between new women and sorority
women in classes, on the athletic
field, and at any gathering in con
nection with student or University
activities.
(J. Sisters and cousins may be together
at any time or place, provided that no
sorority sister or other new woman
is present.
7. An unaffiliated transfer is not to take
part in fall or winter rushing.

ica's first printing press at Cambridge,
Mass., and printed the "Freeman's
Oath" in 1639.
It is said that only one of every four
Americans ever visits a dentist.
