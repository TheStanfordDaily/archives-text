# Laissez-Faire Better Than New Deal, Says Prof. Crum
## 
### 
Despite certain faults, the old laissez
faire system of business economics was
less rigid than those policies contained
in the present New Deal program. Dr.
William Crum, professor of economics
at Harvard and acting professor of
economit's during the current summer
quarter, told the Palo Alto Rotary Club
last Monday night.
Dr. Crum described laissez-faire as
the system which allows the greatest
amount of freedom for private busi
ness enterprises, at the same time be
ing consistent with the free operation
of enterprises for others. The speaker
declared that the old system was not
ideal, but that, unlike the- New Deal,
it could be modified for improvement.
He asserted that the wholesale attacks
on big business by the government have
been wholly unwarranted, as it has been
handled as honestly and competently as
any group could have done it.

The earth as a whole weighs 345
pounds per cubic foot. The heaviest
rocks weigh only 200 pounds per cubic
foot, therefore we know that the earth
is not solid rock.
