## 
### 
The approach of the college graduate
to politics should not be academic, de
clared George J. Hatfield, Stanford
graduate, who is seeking the Republican
nomination for lieutenant-governor, in
an interview yesterday.
Mr. Hatfield believes that the "high
hat" attitude has ruined the public
careers of many who. although poten
tially promising, could not make the
necessary distinction between theory
and practice.
"As a citizen and a voter, as a rank
and file participant in movements for
improving government, the contribu
tion of the college graduate should
provide the safe and sane leavening
needed to prevent the spread of fan
tastic 'isms' and to combat the intrusion
of demogoguery," he asserted.
One way in which university students
may keep well informed on political
issues, Mr. Hatfield suggested, is by
maintaining contact with those cur
rently vested with responsibility for
directing public affairs.
Mr, Hatfield, who has for more than
seven years been United States Dis
trict Attorney, received the BA. degree
in 1911 and the J.D. degree in 1913.
He is a member of Phi Beta Kappa.
