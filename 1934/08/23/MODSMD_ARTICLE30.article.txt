# Water Polo Importance Is Growing at Cal, Stanford
## 
### 
Evidence that water polo is breaking
away from a status as a companion
sport of swimming meets is plain at
both California and Stanford.
Over at Encina pools Coach Thornton
can be seen almost any day coaching
parts of his team into shape for a game
with U.C.L.A. the second week in Octo
ber. While California, through Coach
A1 Dowden, has just announced a
schedule for California in the fall which
will separate water polo from ordinary
swimming.
Stanford, undefeated champions for
the past two years, will not meet Cali
fornia until November 24; but in the
meantime both teams will have played
two games each with both U.S.C. and
U.C.L.A. The Olympic and Athens
Clubs will also be met by university
teams.
Vlad Taranik and Leo Cook are
among the varsity players practicing
daily under Coach Thornton's direction.
