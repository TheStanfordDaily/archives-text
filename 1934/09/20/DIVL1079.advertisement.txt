Frankly, we believe this 1
be the finest year that Stanfabto
has ever had.
With increased number of wom
en students . . . added facilities
for housing ... a faculty second
to none ... a home schedule
that is something to rave about
... a coaching staff that has
plenty of what it takes . . . fel
lows who have come back this
Fall with the old fire in their
eyes . . . trained down to mid
season condition —we have
never seen better spirit.
Incidentally when you need a
jeweler you can get the same
good old service, in the sajne old
way—first on the avenu
for the clock!
