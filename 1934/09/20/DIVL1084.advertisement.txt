1935 STANFORD QUAD
THE YEAR BOOK OF STANFORD UNIVERSITY
EVERETT C. MOSES, Editor N CHARLES H. FONTIUS, Manager
Thursday, September 20, 1934
DEAR NEW STUDENT
You are about to begin your college career at Stanford
University. These years will be among the happiest of your
entire life. You will build friendships which will last for
many years. The experiences you have while in college will be
your most pleasant memories as you grow older.
For the past forty-one-years the yearbook, known as the
QUAD, has been published by the students of Stanford Univer
sity. Every full-fledged Stanfordite wants a copy of the QUAD.
He knows that in years to come it will bring back memories of
those happy years spent on the "farm"â€”it will carry him
back to the old group of intimates, most of whom are widely
scattered; it will remind him of the exciting finish of some
basketball game or some bitterly fought struggle on the foot
ball field; it will cause him to relive (in dreams only)
exciting escapades; it will bring to his mind thoughts of gay
social affairs.
As Editor of the 1935 QUAD, Everett Moses has planned
a book for you which we believe will fulfill this mission
even better than its predecessors.
The price of the QUAD is $6.15 with the student's name
on the cover and $5.65 without. For the first two weeks this
year we are offering the book at $5.65 with name on the cover
and $5.15 without. The price will be raised to the old figure
on Tuesday, October 16th without fail. By filling out the
attached order blank and mailing it to P.O. Box 100, Stan
ford University, California, at once, you will insure yourself
of a copy of the 1935 QUAD at this low figure. Take our ad
vice and buy one now because you will wish you had when you
see the book.
Sincerely yours,
Everett Moses, Editor
