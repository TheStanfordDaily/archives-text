# Triolo Planning Rooting Section For Santa Clara
## 
### 
Rooters' hats, those little con
traptions of cardinal and v/hite
worn at football games and in
rumble seats, may be purchased
this year at Wideman's, 185 Uni
versity avenue, Palo Alto. Head
Rallyman Julius Jacobs said he
believed last year's price of 65
cents would be somewhat re
duced.
Yell Leader Jimmy Triolo,
who plans a rooting section for '
the Santa Clara game on Septem
ber 29, asks that all rooters be
provided with the flaming head
gear by that time.
