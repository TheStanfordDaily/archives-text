# Old Friendships and New Acquaintances, Thrill At Homecoming
## 
### 
The renewal of campus friendships
during the opening of the fall quar
ter and, for the entering student, the
thrill of meeting and becoming ac
quainted with his classmates are al
ways memorable experiences. This
is especially true at Stanford. It is
a family affair in which the whole
University participates. You will feel
and realize this homecoming spirit
long before you reach Palm Drive
and see ahead of you the beautiful
University buildings in their foothill
setting.
You may be assured that the ad
ministrative officers of the Univer
sity, the faculty, student body offi
cers, special student committees and
individuals all will take an active
part in wishing you the same hearty
homecoming greeting that the Stan
ford Daily is extending to you in
this special edition.
The Dean of Men sends you his
''hello" and best wishes for a happy
and very much worth while year.
GEORGE B. CULVER,
Dean of Men
