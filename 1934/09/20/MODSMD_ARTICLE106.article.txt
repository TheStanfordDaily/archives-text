3. Normal contacts on the campus
between fraternity men and new
lower division men are permitted.
Such normal contact is defined as
"contact of a public and informal
nature."
4. No off-campus rushing is per

quarters and in the summer arid
Thanksgiving vacations.

to be pledged, or both.. This penalty
is to be applied by the Interfrater
nity Board of Control, both as to ihe
fraternity and to the rushee or rush
