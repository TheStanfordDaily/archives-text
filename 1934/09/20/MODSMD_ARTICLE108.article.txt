# INDIANS GATHER N. C. A. A, GOLF CHAMPIONSHIPS
## Lawson Little, Amateur Champ, Heads Stanford Summer Victors STUART HAWLEY STARS Jim Willson Makes National Track Win Possible 
### 
The Stanford Seven, aided and |
abetted by the "kid who wasn t even J
invited," successfully opened an j
otherwise also suceessiul period of j
summer Cardinal accomplishments.
The Seven, those track stalwarts
who won the 1.C.-4A. track and field
championship last spring while j
school was still in session, waited |
until after linals to capture the other j
big national championship—the N.C. j
A A. And then the Seven would not j
have done it if Jimmy Willson, the j
kid who wasn t asked, had not in
vited himself.
Victory Was Surprise
Stanford with 63 points scored a
totally unexpected victory over
U.S.C. and Louisiana State. Will
son, with a third in the 220-yard
dash and a fifth in the 100, person
ally accounted for eight of the dig
its, without which Stanford would
have taken second to El Trojan.
Sam Klopstoek was declared win- j
r.er of a blanket finish in the high
hurdles, and Gordon Dunn captured
discus throw honors for the only
two Cardinal victories of the meet.
Big Ben Eastman, Johnny Lyman,
Dunn, and Johnny Mottram con
tinued their track campaigns and
gathered places in the national
A.A.U. meet in Milwaukee, East
man took lirst in the 880-yard run.
while the other three were content
with second places in the shot, dis
cus, and javelin.
Trackmen Travel
Eastman, Lyman, and Dunn joined
American squads in foreign meets;
Ihe lirst two traveled to Europe, and
Dunn sailed to Japan for a series of
meets.
Most of the other Stanford sum
mer victories were made on the golf
course. Dan Moser and Don Ed
wards opposed each other in the fi
nals of the Orinda tournament, with
Moser finally winning. Stuart Haw
ley annexed both the Northern Cali
fornia and state amateur titles, de
feating Edwards in the finals of the
slate tourney at Pebble Beach last
month in a close one-up match.
Little Real Standout
After his sensational victory in the
British open last spring, Lawson
Little returned to his own back yard
and captured the Northern Califor
nia open. This month he again added
to his laurels by smothering "Spec"
Goldman of Dallas, Texas, 8 and 7,
in their 36-hole final round of the
national amateur championship at
Brookline, Mass.
Chuck Otis, last year's tennis cap
tain, distinguished himself by cap
