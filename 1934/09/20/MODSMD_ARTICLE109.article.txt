# New Football Rules Favor Passing Game
## 
### 
Stanford—and for that matter most
of the teams in the country—will
take to the air to a greater extent
this year than before.
And one of the major reasons for
this will be that the new football
rules seem to favor the offensive, and
particularly the passing kind of of
fensive.
Two of these specifications for
play particularly will make for a
more spectacular type of offensive
and probably a bit more scoring. The
first is that two incompleted passes
in the same series of downs will no
longer draw a five-yard penalty.
This year the only compunctions
teams will have in passing for the
second time will be that the attempt
will cost a dov/n.
The second rule, one which will
probably affect the score more di
rectly, is that one pass which falls
incomplete across the opposing goal
will not constitute a touchbaek, as
it has in former years. Only on the
second incompleted pass across the
pay stripe will the offensive team be
asked to turn the ball over to the
opposition on the twenty-yard line.
This second rule will put the de
fense on a "spot." Always before,
the defending team has been coached
to bat a pass across the goal, because
that way this team would receive the
ball on the twenty-yard line. In the
future, with the first pass counting
as merely an incompleted pass, the
defensive players under most cir
cumstances will attempt to intercept

the pass, with the chance of being
tackled before they recross the goal
line, and hence incurring a two-point
safety.
The widely heralded change in the
size of the ball in reality will not
have a great deal of effect on the
game, in the opinion of Coach Tiny
Thornhill. The 1934 pigskin is some
what smaller, and hence will give)
punters a smaller contact surface, ,
which may make kicks poorer, and
poor kicks more frequent.
The new ball probably will not af- |
feet passing greatly, although it may
aid the receiver to a slight extent,
Thornhill pointed out. Because of its
"crazy bounce" the smaller ball may
make for more fumbles on the part
of punt receivers.
The other rules were left un-1
changed except for clearing up of 1
minor points and phrasing technical
rules a bit more clearly.
A new interpretation of the dead

| ball rule will be made on the Pacific
I Coast this year. The rule states that
the ball is dead WHEN any part <>;
the body except hands or feet
i touches the ground. The old con
ference interpretation placed the ball
dead at the spot WHERE a knee or
other portion of the carrier's body
touched the turf.
This year, however, the ball will
, be advanced to the fullest extent.
The old interpretation cost Stanford
1 the 1932 Big Game. In the first half,
'■ Bill Sims knee touched the ground
on the one-inch line of California.
The ball was hovering over the goal
line, but the pigskin was declared
dead at the one-inch line. The game
ended in a 0-0 tie.

opposition on the twenty-yard line.
This second rule will put the de
fense on a "spot." Always before,
the defending team has been coached
to bat a pass across the goal, because
that way this team would receive the
ball on the twenty-yard line. In the
future, with the first pass counting
as merely an incompleted pass, the
defensive players under most cir
cumstances will attempt to intercept

the pass, with the chance of being
tackled before they recross the goal
line, and hence incurring a two-point
safety.
The widely heralded change in the
size of the ball in reality will not
have a great deal of effect on the
game, in the opinion of Coach Tiny
Thornhill. The 1934 pigskin is some
what smaller, and hence will give)
punters a smaller contact surface, ,
which may make kicks poorer, and
poor kicks more frequent.
The new ball probably will not af- |
feet passing greatly, although it may
aid the receiver to a slight extent,
Thornhill pointed out. Because of its
"crazy bounce" the smaller ball may
make for more fumbles on the part
of punt receivers.
The other rules were left un-1
changed except for clearing up of 1
minor points and phrasing technical
rules a bit more clearly.
A new interpretation of the dead

| ball rule will be made on the Pacific
I Coast this year. The rule states that
the ball is dead WHEN any part <>;
the body except hands or feet
i touches the ground. The old con
ference interpretation placed the ball
dead at the spot WHERE a knee or
other portion of the carrier's body
touched the turf.
This year, however, the ball will
, be advanced to the fullest extent.
The old interpretation cost Stanford
1 the 1932 Big Game. In the first half,
'■ Bill Sims knee touched the ground
on the one-inch line of California.
The ball was hovering over the goal
line, but the pigskin was declared
dead at the one-inch line. The game
ended in a 0-0 tie.
Stanford—and for that matter most
of the teams in the country—will
take to the air to a greater extent
this year than before.
And one of the major reasons for
this will be that the new football
rules seem to favor the offensive, and
particularly the passing kind of of
fensive.
Two of these specifications for
play particularly will make for a
more spectacular type of offensive
and probably a bit more scoring. The
first is that two incompleted passes
in the same series of downs will no
longer draw a five-yard penalty.
This year the only compunctions
teams will have in passing for the
second time will be that the attempt
will cost a dov/n.
The second rule, one which will
probably affect the score more di
rectly, is that one pass which falls
incomplete across the opposing goal
will not constitute a touchbaek, as
it has in former years. Only on the
second incompleted pass across the
pay stripe will the offensive team be
asked to turn the ball over to the
opposition on the twenty-yard line.
