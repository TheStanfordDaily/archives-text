# New Football Rules Favor Passing Game
## 
### 
Stanford—and for that matter most
of the teams in the country—will
take to the air to a greater extent
this year than before.
And one of the major reasons for
this will be that the new football
rules seem to favor the offensive, and
particularly the passing kind of of
fensive.
Two of these specifications for
play particularly will make for a
more spectacular type of offensive
and probably a bit more scoring. The
first is that two incompleted passes
in the same series of downs will no
longer draw a five-yard penalty.
This year the only compunctions
teams will have in passing for the
second time will be that the attempt
will cost a dov/n.
The second rule, one which will
probably affect the score more di
rectly, is that one pass which falls
incomplete across the opposing goal
will not constitute a touchbaek, as
it has in former years. Only on the
second incompleted pass across the
pay stripe will the offensive team be
asked to turn the ball over to the
opposition on the twenty-yard line.
This second rule will put the de
fense on a "spot." Always before,
the defending team has been coached
to bat a pass across the goal, because
that way this team would receive the
ball on the twenty-yard line. In the
future, with the first pass counting
as merely an incompleted pass, the
defensive players under most cir
cumstances will attempt to intercept
