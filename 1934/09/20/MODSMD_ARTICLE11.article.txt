# Row, Clubs Both Prosper
## Need for Two Types of Organizations Seen 
### 
Something very unsual in Stan
ford's social and fraternal life,
found rarely elsewhere, lies in the
existence of both clubs and fraterni
ties for Stanford men.
Twenty-four fraternities on the
row for men who wish to live togeth
er and the eight eiting clubs plus four
men's dormitories for men not af
filiated with a Greek letter organi
zation are available.
Houses Not Unique
Fraternities at Stanford need no
explanation, inasmuch as they re
semble those on other campuses in
thus respect, except that there is no
distinction here between "Row" and
"Hall" men, and both are equally
prominent in campus activities.
On the other hand, clubs are new
to most incoming men. Need for
such organizations was found early
in Stanford history for those who de
sired to live where they wished, in
modern dormitories or private resi
dences, and still meet for meals and
social purposes with congenial
friends who might prove of mutual
benefit.
Difference Explained
The chief difference between clubs
and fraternities lies in the fact that
men live together in units and are
bound by more group regulations in
the latter for the greater develop
ment of individuals and associations.
While most of the fraternities are
on or near Lasuen, the eating clubs
are to be found adjoining the men's
dormitories between Toyon and En
cina halls.
Complete information as to com
parative living costs, initiation fees,
dues, may be had either from the
Encina sponsors or at the Dean of
Men's office.
