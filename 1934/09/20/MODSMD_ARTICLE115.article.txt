## Varsity Squad Preparing For San Jose Contest; 75 Out For Frosh Team Coach Bradshaw Selects Two Teams for Early Practice Sessions AVERAGE WEIGHT 180 Frosh Will Open October 6 Against Menlo J.C. 
### 
Some 75 stars and near stars from I
high schools in all parts are gathered j
on the Stanford freshman football
squad, and it remains for Coach |
Jimmy "Rabbit" Bradshaw to con- j
gregate this group into a smooth- (
functioning team in the next three i
weeks.
Bradshaw opened frosh practice j
along with the varsity September 15,
and spent the first few days mostly j
in fundamentals and in acquainting ]
his squad, members of which have
used nearly every type of system on j
the gridiron, with the type of play.
The frosh schedule will open Octo- .
her 6 with Menlo Junior College.
Two Teams Chosen
From his 75 candidates, Bradshaw
has already tentatively selected two
teams for signal practice. At present, j
: the 22 chosen ones seem the out
! standing candidates for first and sec
ond team honors. These, however,
probably will interchange on the
starting line-up for the first few
weeks of the season.
Ed Gillette, a former Santa Mo
nica star, and Bill Roberts, from j
j Galileo High School, have stood out j
' in the fight for the quarterback posi- j
| tion. Glenn Hamilton of Patterson j
i is battling William Paulman of Ox- |
i nard for the fullback choice.
Four Good Wings
I Four reputedly stellar prep half
backs have been assigned to the first
| team: Jimmy Coffis of Commerce
High, San Francisco; Doc Luckett,
1 from Texas; Tom Collins, much pub
i licized Portland player, and Varick
I Martin of Pasadena.
i Mervyn Sullivan of Birds Landing,
' Millard Heath of The Dalles, Oregon,
and Carleton Boydl of Willows are so
' far a toss-up for the pivot center
j position.
Bradshaw's guards include Russell |
! McKinney of Visalia, Jay Holdridge j
! of Los Angeles, Walter Gregory of j
Piedmont, and Allen Yates. Four |
husky tackles are steadily at work j
for the number one berths at these
| positions, Irving Henningson of Hay
i ward, Cy Oberg of San Diego, San- ,
j ford Paganucci of Tamalpais, and i
Otto Beringer of St. Helena.
j Jimmy Dillon of Galileo and Rob- j
i crt Dakan of Commerce, two San
1 Francisco fiankmen. will be battling
I Berneth Layer of Salinas and Grant
j Stone of San Diego for first string
I work at the ends.
| The first two teams hit the scalcs
! at an average of 180 pounds. Brad
' shaw seems fairly satisfied at the
j weikht and speed of his squad in
' general.
